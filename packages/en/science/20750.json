By SPENCE BATE, Esq., F.L.S.\r\n\r\n[Read January 21, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the various genera of Decapod Crustacea none are more interesting, or\r\nmore difficult of description, than those which constitute the family\r\nGalatheadæ.\r\n\r\nThe interest attaching to these forms arises from the intermediate\r\nposition which they occupy in the natural arrangement of the class,\r\ntheir structure placing them between the Macrura and Brachyura; in\r\naccordance with which we find that, whilst Professor M.-Edwards classes\r\nthem among the Macrura, Professor Bell, in his work on the British\r\nCrustacea, places them (more correctly, as we think) in the intermediate\r\ngroup of Anomura.\r\n\r\nThis opinion is fully borne out both in the development of the animals\r\nand in their structure in the adult state.\r\n\r\nThe early form of the larva bears, anteriorly, a resemblance to the\r\nBrachyural type, whilst the caudal appendages assimilate to those of the\r\nMacrura. The same conditions obtain in the young of Anomura. At the time\r\nof birth, the larva, like that of the Brachyura, has only the two\r\ngnathopoda developed, whilst the termination of the tail is like that\r\nof a fish, as in the Macrura. In the adult, the internal antennæ possess\r\nshort flagella and complementary appendages, such as exist in the order\r\nBrachyura, whilst the external antennæ have the long and slender\r\nflagella proper to the Macrura. The _scale_, however, commonly appended\r\nto the external antennæ in the latter order is wanting, a circumstance\r\nwhich exhibits a relation to the Brachyura.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the legs shows that the coxæ are fused with the\r\nthorax, as in the Brachyura, and not articulated with it as in the\r\nMacrura, whilst, on the other hand, the posterior division and caudal\r\ntermination approach the Macrural type more nearly than that of the\r\nBrachyura, the animal thus assuming a character intermediate between the\r\ntwo orders.\r\n\r\nBut in the description of the several species of the genus _Galathea_, a\r\npeculiar difficulty appears to arise, originating in the affinity which\r\nthey bear to each other. So close, in fact, is the approximation, that\r\nthe descriptions of the best writers will scarcely avail for the\r\ndistinction of the individual species without the assistance of figures.\r\nThis arises from the fact that the general characters, upon which the\r\ndescriptions are based, vary, in this genus, only in their comparative\r\ndegrees of development.\r\n\r\nIn the three species recognized in Professor Bell's work on the British\r\nCrustacea, it will be found that each species retains the same\r\ncharacters in greater or less degree.\r\n\r\n_Galathea strigosa_ is peculiar for the spinous character of the\r\ncarapace and cheliform legs. Every spine, however, is repeated in both\r\nthe other species, only less developed. We find the rostrum furnished\r\nwith four lateral teeth on each side, a character which also exists in\r\neach of the other species; and although close observation may detect a\r\nslightly different arrangement in the relative position of these teeth,\r\nthe differences are not of sufficient importance to enable a naturalist\r\nthence to derive a specific distinction, unless the peculiarity is\r\nseconded by some more unqualified character less liable to be affected\r\nby any peculiarity of condition.\r\n\r\nIn order to arrive at more certain results in the identification of\r\nspecies, we think that the microscopic examination of the surface of the\r\nintegument will be found peculiarly useful.\r\n\r\nThis mode of examination of species may also be applied to a\r\nconsiderable extent throughout the Crustacea generally with great\r\nadvantage; and if found valuable in recent, there can be no doubt that\r\nit will prove of far greater importance in extinct forms, where parts\r\non which the identification of species visually rests are lost, and\r\nfragments only of the animal obtainable.\r\n\r\nIt should be borne in mind that, as the structure in question undergoes\r\nmodifications more or less considerable in different parts of the\r\nanimal, it will always be advisable to compare the corresponding parts\r\nwith each other.\r\n\r\nApplying this test to the known species of _Galathea,_ we perceive that\r\nthe structure of the integument upon the arms, independent of the\r\nmarginal spines, exhibits a squamiform appearance, but that the scales,\r\nwhich characterise the structure, possess features peculiar to each\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIn _Galathea strigosa_ the scales are convex, distant from each other,\r\nsmooth at the edge, and fringed with long hairs. In _G. squamifera_ they\r\nare convex, closely placed, scalloped at the edge, and without hairs. In\r\n_G. nexa_ the scales are obsolete, tufts of hair representing the\r\nsupposed edges. In _G. depressa_, n. sp., the scales are broad, less\r\nconvex than in _G. strigosa_ and _G. squamifera_, smooth, closely set,\r\nand fringed with short hairs. In _G. Andrewsii_ they are small, distant,\r\nvery convex, tipped with red, and slightly furnished with hair.\r\n\r\nAs another instance of the practical application of the microscopical\r\nexamination of the surface, I would refer to two species of Amphipoda,\r\nclassed by Leach under the name of _Gammarus Locusta_, from his\r\ninability to assign them any separate specific characters. In the\r\nstructure of their integuments, however, these two forms will be found\r\nto exhibit widely different microscopical appearances.\r\n\r\nAgain, there exists in the same group three or four species, the\r\ndescription of any one of which would apply to either of the others; and\r\nit is probable they would never have been ranked as separate species had\r\nnot their habitats been geographically distant. Thus _Gammarus Olivii_,\r\nM.-Ed., _G. affinis_, M.-E., _G. Kröyii_, Rathke, and _G. gracilis_, R.,\r\ncan only be specifically determined by a microscopic examination of the\r\nintegument.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of other Amphipoda, such as _Urothoe inostratus_,\r\nDana, from South America, which so nearly resembles in form the _U.\r\nelegans_ of the British shores.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALATHEA DISPERSA, mihi.\r\n\r\n_G._ rostro brevi, dentibus 4 utrinque ornato, 2 anterioribus minoribus;\r\npedibus anterioribus elongatis, sparse spiosus; chelarum digitis\r\nparallelis.\r\n\r\nGalathea with short rostrum, armed on each side with 4 teeth, the two\r\nposterior being less important than the two anterior. The fingers of the\r\nchelæ impinge through their whole length; outer margin of the hand\r\nfurnished with 3 or 4 small spines.\r\n\r\n_Hab._ Trawling-ground, Plymouth, common; Moray Frith, Scotland.\r\n\r\nThis species unites _G. Andrewsii_ with _G. nexa_, and, I think, has\r\noften been mistaken for the young of the latter; but _G. nexa_, so far\r\nas my experience goes, is a species peculiar to the north of England,\r\nwhereas _G. dispersa_, I anticipate, will be found to be the most\r\nuniversally dispersed, in deep water, of any of the species known. It\r\ncan always be detected from _G. nexa_ by the form of the hand and the\r\nmanner in which the fingers impinge: in _G. nexa_ the hand is broad\r\ntowards the extremity, and the fingers meet only at the apex; in _G.\r\ndispersa_ the hand gradually narrows to the apex, and the fingers meet\r\neach other through their whole length, the inner margin of the finger\r\nbeing finely serrated, the thumb not.\r\n\r\nIt also may be distinguished from _G. Andrewsii_ by the breadth of the\r\nhands, which are narrow and round in _G. Andrewsii_, and moderately\r\nbroad and flat in _G. dispersa_.\r\n\r\nBy an examination of the texture of the integument under a magnifying\r\npower of low degree, the surface of _G. dispersa_ will be seen\r\ndistinctly to differ from that of any of the others; it is covered with\r\nflat scales, fringed with short cilia. The length of the animal,\r\nincluding the arms, is about 2-1/4 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCatalogue of Hymenopterous Insects collected at Celebes by Mr. A. R.\r\nWALLACE. By FREDERICK SMITH, Esq., Assistant in the Zoological\r\nDepartment, British Museum. Communicated by W. W. SAUNDERS, Esq.,\r\nF.R.S., F.L.S.\r\n\r\n[Read April 15th, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis collection of the Hymenoptera of Celebes is specially interesting,\r\nas adding greatly to our knowledge of the geographical range of many\r\nwell-known species, while the additions made to the Fossorial group\r\ncontain many of great beauty and rarity. A new species belonging to the\r\ntribe of Solitary Wasps, _Odynerus clavicornis_, is perhaps the most\r\ninteresting insect in the collection; this Wasp has clavate antennæ, the\r\nflagellum being broadly dilated towards the apex, convex above and\r\nconcave beneath. I am not acquainted with any other insect belonging to\r\nthe Vespidious group which exhibits such an anomaly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFam. ANDRENIDÆ, _Leach._\r\n\r\nGen. SPHECODES, _Latr._\r\n\r\n1.

By THOMAS BELL, Esq., Pres. L. S.\r\n\r\n[Read June 3rd, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFam. PINNOTHERIDÆ, _Edwards_.\r\n\r\nGenus AMORPHOPUS, _Bell_.\r\n\r\nCHAR. GEN.:--Corpus subcylindricum. Testa semicircularis, margine\r\nposteriore recto.--_Antennæ externæ minimæ_, articulo basali orbitam\r\nsubtus partim claudente.--_Antennularum fossulæ_ transversæ, continuæ,\r\net ab orbitis haud separatæ.--_Pedipalpi externi_ articulo quarto ovato,\r\npalpo tri-articulato, ad angulum antico-interiorem articuli quarti\r\ninserto.--Oris apertura antice arcuata.--_Orbitæ_ apertæ, margine\r\ninferiore carente, superiore integro.--_Oculi_ transversim\r\npositi.--_Pedes antici_ robusti, inæquales; _pedum paria secundum,\r\ntertium et quartum_ longa, subcompressa; _par quintum_ exiguum,\r\nsimplicissimum, rudimentarium, in incisura articuli basalis paris quarti\r\ninsertum.--_Abdomen_ MARIS segmentis tertio cum quarto, et quinto cum\r\nsexto coalitis; FOEMINÆ?\r\n\r\nSp. unica. _Amorphopus cylindraceus_, mihi.\r\n\r\n_Description._--The body is nearly cylindrical, somewhat depressed, the\r\ncarapace very much curved from the point to the back, quite straight\r\nfrom side to side; the anterior and lateral margins forming nearly a\r\nsemicircle, the posterior margin straight; the orbits are deeply cut in\r\nthe anterior margin of the carapace, looking upwards; the inferior\r\nmargin wanting; the oral aperture much arched anteriorly; the external\r\nfootjaws with the third articulation somewhat rhomboid, the fourth\r\nirregularly oval, and the palpi three-jointed, inserted at its anterior\r\nand inner angle. Epistome extremely small, transversely linear; the\r\nexternal antennæ placed directly beneath the orbits, the basal joints\r\npartly filling them beneath. The antennules folded transversely in large\r\nopen fossæ, which are scarcely at all separated from each other, and are\r\nopen to the orbits, the eyes lying transversely; the peduncles short and\r\nthick; the sternum is semicircular, the segments separated by very deep\r\ngrooves; the abdomen very long and narrow, the first and second joint\r\ntransversely linear, the third and fourth united and forming a triangle\r\ntruncated anteriorly at the articulation of the portion formed by the\r\nfifth and sixth joints united, and which with the seventh form a very\r\nnarrow and linear piece extending forwards to the posterior margin of\r\nthe oral aperture; the first pair of legs robust, unequal (the right\r\nbeing the larger in the only specimen at present observed); the hand in\r\neach as broad as it is long; that of the smaller conspicuously\r\ntuberculated, that of the larger much less so; the former with the\r\nfingers nearly meeting throughout their length, those of the latter only\r\nat the tips; the second, third, and fourth pairs of legs are long,\r\nsomewhat compressed, the third joint tuberculated on the under side, the\r\nthird pair the longest; the fifth pair is reduced to a mere rudiment, in\r\nthe form of a minute tubercle inserted in a little notch at the base of\r\nthe first joint of the fourth pair, and scarcely discernible by the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\n_Observations._--The relation of this genus to the Pinnotheridæ is\r\ntolerably obvious, in the smallness of the antennæ, the direction and\r\narrangement of the eyes, and particularly in the form of the oral\r\naperture, and of the external footjaws. I shall not, however, enter upon\r\nthe consideration of these relations, as I am about shortly to offer to\r\nthe Society a review and monograph of the whole of this family. The most\r\nremarkable peculiarity in the genus is the apparent absence of the fifth\r\npair of legs, which can only be discovered to exist at all by\r\nexamination with the help of a lens. In this respect I doubt not that\r\nthe Fabrician genus _Hexapus_, adopted and figured by De Haan, will be\r\nfound to agree with it, although it is very remarkable that the\r\nanomalous condition of this part never excited any particular attention\r\non the part of either of these distinguished naturalists; and De Haan\r\ndescribes Fabricius's species, _Hexapus sexpes_, as if there were\r\nnothing especial or abnormal in a Decapod having only six pairs of legs\r\nbesides the claws. Mr. White made a similar mistake on one occasion,\r\nwhen he described an anomourous genus allied to _Lithodes_, in which the\r\nfifth pair of legs were not visible; but when, at my suggestion, a more\r\ncareful examination was made, they were found, as was anticipated, in a\r\nrudimentary form, concealed under the edge of the carapace. I believe\r\nthat I can discover even in De Haan's figure something like a little\r\ntubercle at the base of the fourth leg, which is probably the\r\nrudimentary representative of the fifth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDeath of the Common Hive Bee, supposed to be occasioned by a parasitic\r\nFungus. By the Rev. HENRY HIGGINS. Communicated by the President.\r\n\r\n[Read June 3rd, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of March last, Timpron Martin, Esq., of Liverpool,\r\ncommunicated to me some circumstances respecting the death of a hive of\r\nbees in his possession, which induced me to request from him a full\r\nstatement of particulars. Mr. Martin gave me the following account:--\r\n\r\n\"In October last I had three hives of bees which I received into my\r\nhouse. Each doorway was closed, and the hive placed upon a piece of\r\ncalico; the corners were brought over the top, leaving a loop by which\r\nthe hive was suspended from the ceiling. The hives were taken down about\r\nthe 14th of March; two were healthy, but all the bees in the third were\r\ndead. There was a gallon of bees. The two hives containing live bees\r\nwere much smaller; but in each of them were dead ones. Under whatever\r\ncircumstances you preserve bees through the winter, dead ones are found\r\nat the bottom, in the spring. The room, an attic, was dry; and I had\r\npreserved the same hives in the same way during the winter of 1856. In\r\nwhat I may call the dead hive there was an abundance of honey when it\r\nwas opened; and it is clear that its inmates did not die for want. It is\r\nnot a frequent occurrence for bees so to die; but I have known another\r\ninstance. In that case the hive was left out in the ordinary way, and\r\npossibly cold was the cause of death. I think it probable that my bees\r\ndied about a month before the 14th of March, merely from the\r\ncircumstance that some one remarked about that time that there was no\r\nnoise in the hive. They might have died earlier; but there were\r\ncertainly live bees in the hive in January. I understand there was an\r\nappearance of mould on some of the combs. There was ample ventilation, I\r\nthink; indeed, as the bees were suspended, they had more air than\r\nthrough the summer when placed on a stand.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the occurrence was first made known to me, I suggested that the\r\nbees might probably have died from the growth of a fungus, and requested\r\nsome of the dead bees might be sent for examination. They were\r\ntransmitted to me in a very dry state; and a careful inspection with a\r\nlens afforded no indications of vegetable growth. I then broke up a\r\nspecimen, and examined the portions under a compound microscope, using a\r\nNachet No. 4. The head and thorax were clean; but on a portion of the\r\nsternum were innumerable very minute, linear, slightly curved bodies,\r\nshowing the well-known oscillatory or swarming motion. Notwithstanding\r\nthe agreement of these minute bodies with the characters of the genus of\r\n_Bacterium_ of the Vibrionia, I regarded them as spermatia, having\r\nfrequently seen others undistinguishable from them under circumstances\r\ninconsistent with the presence of _Confervæ_, as in the interior of the\r\nimmature peridia and sporangia of Fungals.\r\n\r\nIn the specimen first examined there were no other indications of the\r\ngrowth of any parasite; but from the interior of the abdomen of a second\r\nbee I obtained an abundance of well-defined globular bodies resembling\r\nthe spores of a fungus, varying in size from .00016 to .00012 in. Three\r\nout of four specimens subsequently examined contained similar spores\r\nwithin the abdomen. No traces of a mycelium were visible; the plants had\r\ncome to maturity, fruited, and withered away, leaving only the spores.\r\n\r\nThe chief question then remaining to be solved was as to the time when\r\nthe spores were developed; whether before or after the death of the\r\nbees. In order, if possible, to determine this, I placed four of the\r\ndead bees in circumstances favourable for the germination of the spores,\r\nand in about ten days I submitted them again to examination. They were\r\ncovered with mould, consisting chiefly of a species of _Mucor_, and one\r\nalso of _Botrytis_ or _Botryosporium_. These fungi were clearly\r\nextraneous, covering indifferently all parts of the insects, and\r\nspreading on the wood on which they were lying. On the abdomen of all\r\nthe specimens, and on the clypeus of one of them, grew a fungus wholly\r\nunlike the surrounding mould. It was white and very short, and\r\napparently consisted entirely of spores arranged in a moniliform manner,\r\nlike the fertile filaments of a stemless _Penicillium_. These spores\r\nresembled those found in the abdomen of the Bees, and proceeded I think,\r\nfrom them. The filaments were most numerous at the junction of the\r\nsegments. The spores did not resemble the globules in _Sporendonema\r\nmuscæ_ of the English Flora, neither were they apparently enclosed.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. M. J. Berkeley, to whom I sent some of the bees, procured, by\r\nscraping the interior of the abdomen with a lancet, very minute, curved\r\nlinear bodies from 1/8000 to 1/10000 in. long, which he compares to\r\nVibrios. He also found mixed with them globular bodies, but no visible\r\nstratum of mould.\r\n\r\nFrom the peculiar position of the supposed spores within the abdomen of\r\nthe bees, and from the subsequent growth of a fungus unlike any of our\r\ncommon forms of Mucedines, I think it probable that the death of the\r\nbees was occasioned by the presence of a parasitic fungus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice of the occurrence of recent Worm Tracks in the Upper Part of the\r\nLondon Clay Formation near Highgate. By JOHN W. WETHERELL. Communicated\r\nby JAMES YATES, Esq., M.A., F.L.S.\r\n\r\n[Read June 3rd, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London clay is very tenacious, and near the surface is generally of\r\na brown colour, probably owing to the decomposition of the iron pyrites\r\nwhich it contains. It abounds in selenite or sulphate of lime, and in\r\nnodules which often contain organic remains. Fossil wood with _Teredo\r\nantenautæ_ is also met with, and pyritous casts of univalve and bivalve\r\nshells. Lower down the stratum becomes more compact and is of a bluish\r\nor blackish colour, and its fossil contents are in a fine state of\r\npreservation. During the last summer, while examining the London Clay in\r\nthe vicinity of Highgate in search of fossils, my attention was directed\r\nto certain appearances in it which I could not account for. This led to\r\na further examination, when I found they were produced by the borings of\r\n_Lumbrici_ or earth-worms. These appearances consisted of long tubes\r\npassing nearly perpendicularly through the clay and terminating in\r\nreceptacles or _nidi_, each tube leading to a separate receptacle. As\r\nthese receptacles occurred in large numbers, I had an opportunity of\r\nexamining a great many of them with various results. In one instance, I\r\nfound a dead worm coiled up; in another, a portion of a worm protruding\r\ninto the lower part of the tube. Again, _nidi_ were found partially\r\nfilled with only the casts of worms, whilst others contained more or\r\nless of a species of Conferva; and, lastly, I obtained some with the\r\ncavities partially or wholly filled up. The receptacles varied in shape,\r\nfrom a sphere to an oval, and were extremely thin and fragile. They also\r\nvaried in size from a pea to a nut. Externally they presented an\r\nappearance so singularly contorted, that I could not help considering\r\nthey were moulded from the casts of worms. They did not appear to have\r\nany attachment to the surrounding clay, except at the point of junction\r\nwith the tube; and the clay beneath them presented no unusual\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nInternally they generally exhibited impressions of the worm; but\r\noccasionally I detected some of the round and contorted appearances\r\nwhich I have mentioned as being so conspicuous on the outside. I cannot\r\nspeak with precision as to the length of the tubes, as the clay when\r\nexamined had been broken up into large rough masses in digging for the\r\nfoundations of houses. The largest noticed was about three inches long,\r\nand the general width one-eighth of an inch. They often run parallel to\r\neach other, but at unequal distances. I now have to notice what I\r\nconsider a remarkable circumstance, namely, that all the tubes contained\r\na solid cylinder of clay, and in every instance where the worms occurred\r\nunder the circumstances above recorded, they were found to be dead.\r\nResearches of this kind are calculated to throw a light on some of those\r\nsingular phenomena which geologists occasionally meet with in the older\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n[_Mem._--Several specimens of clay, containing the worm-tubes as above\r\ndescribed, were exhibited to the meeting.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural History--Extracts from the Journal of Captain Denham, H.M.\r\nSurveying Vessel 'Herald,' 1857. Communicated by Captain WASHINGTON,\r\nthrough the Secretary.\r\n\r\n[Read June 3rd, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe found upon the larger islands the small species of the Kangaroo,\r\nbearing the native name Wallaby (_Halmaturus Billardierii_), which,\r\nwhen mixed with other meats, affords a fine-flavoured soup.\r\n\r\nOn the islets are flocks of the Cape Banca goose, which Mr. Smith\r\ninformed me were only to be found in these straits in the vicinity of\r\nFlinders Island, from Cape Banca to Cape Frankland (west about), and\r\nthat they are readily domesticated, and hatch from three to seven eggs,\r\nand afford an acceptable dish. I obtained a live specimen, which Dr.\r\nRayner of this ship describes thus:--\"_Cereopsis Novæ Hollandiæ_. Body\r\nabout the size of a common goose; bill short, vaulted, obtuse,\r\ntwo-thirds of which is covered by an expanded cere of a pale\r\ngreenish-yellow colour, the tip of the bill being black, arcuated, and\r\ntruncated. Nostrils large, round, open, and situated in the middle of\r\nthe bill. Wings ample, third quill longest. Legs long, light dull-red,\r\nand naked to a little above the knee. Feet black, webbed, the membrane\r\nbeing deeply notched, great toe articulated to the metatarsus. Plumage\r\nslate-grey, with black spots upon the wings and back. Wing-feathers\r\ndusky black, and edged at the tip with pale grey. Irides light hazel.\"\r\n\r\nWe likewise obtained specimens of the following wildfowl:--\r\n\r\nAVES.\r\n\r\n  A BRONZE-WING PIGEON,   Phaps elegans.\r\n  QUAIL,                  Corturnix pectoralis (_Gould_).\r\n  OYSTER-CATCHER,         Hæmatophus fuliginosus.\r\n  RING PLOVER,            Hiaticula bicincta.\r\n  WILD DUCK,              Anas punctata (_Cuvier_).\r\n  GREAT GULL,             Larus pacificus.\r\n  LESSER GULL,            Xema Jamesonii.\r\n  MUTTON BIRD,            Puffinus brevicaudus (_Brandt_).\r\n  SOUTHERN GANNET,        Sulu australis (_Gould_).\r\n  SMALL PENGUIN,          Spheniscus minor (_Temminck_).\r\n\r\nThe Mutton Bird we observed streaming from island to island; and I\r\nlearnt from Mr. Benvenuto Smith the following particulars of its habits\r\nfrom his own observations.\r\n\r\nThe male birds come in from sea in the month of September, and prepare\r\nthe burrows for the reception of the hens. The hen bird does not make\r\nher appearance till about the 25th November, when she lays and sits at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nThe Mutton Bird lays but one egg; they are employed rearing the young\r\nbird until the month of May, at which time the old birds leave the young\r\nones to shift for themselves; the young birds remain in the burrows till\r\nthey are starved down, and then set off to sea, and are not seen again\r\namongst the islands till September. The cock and hen sit alternately\r\nnight and day; and all the labour of providing for the young is equally\r\nshared.\r\n\r\nThere are at this date about ninety people living on the small islands\r\nin \"Franklin Inlet\" who make a livelihood by gathering the oil,\r\nfeathers, and eggs of the Mutton Bird.\r\n\r\nUpwards of 2000 gallons of the oil are extracted from the birds\r\nannually; and although 300,000 birds are known to be destroyed each\r\nyear, they appear undiminished in numbers. The oil burns well, and is of\r\na bright-red colour.\r\n\r\nI was presented by Mr. Smith with two Paper Nautilus shells (_Argonauta\r\ntuberculosa_) found on the shore of Flinders Island this season, a\r\ncircumstance which he has remarked occurs but every seventh year, when\r\nmany hundreds are thrown up: the shells are rarely obtained perfect, as\r\nthey are extremely fragile, and the sea fowl pick the fish out of them.\r\n\r\nOur Botanic Collector, Mr. Milne, ascertained, from what he obtained\r\nhimself and from what we could contribute from our individual visits to\r\nthe islets, the existence of plants, which he believes to be indigenous,\r\nbelonging to the following families and genera, viz.\r\n\r\n  Amentaceæ.

By T. H. HUXLEY,\r\nF.R.S., Professor of Natural History, Government School of Mines.\r\n\r\n[Read June 3rd, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome time ago my friend Dr. Sinclair, of New Zealand, had the kindness\r\nto offer me two specimens of the Pearly Nautilus which had been brought\r\nto him from New Caledonia, preserved in Goadby's solution. I gladly\r\naccepted the present, and looked forward to the dissection of the rare\r\nanimal with no little pleasure; but on proceeding to examine one of the\r\nspecimens, I found its anatomical value greatly diminished by the manner\r\nin which a deposit from the solution had glued together some of the\r\ninternal viscera. Other parts of the Nautilus, however, were in a very\r\ngood state of preservation; and I have noted down such novel and\r\ninteresting peculiarities as they presented, in the hope that an account\r\nof them will be acceptable to the Linnean Society.\r\n\r\nOf the six apertures which, besides the genital and anal outlets, open\r\ninto the branchial cavity of _Nautilus pompilius_, one on each side lies\r\nimmediately above and in front of that fold of the inner wall of the\r\nmantle which forms the lower root of the smaller and inner gill, and\r\nencloses the branchial vein of that gill. The aperture is elongated and\r\nnarrow, with rather prominent lips. It measures about 1/8th of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe other two apertures are larger, and lie at a distance of 7/16ths of\r\nan inch below and behind the other. They are in close juxta-position,\r\nbeing separated only by a thin triangular fold of membrane, which\r\nconstitutes the inner lip of the one and the outer lip of the other.\r\n\r\nThe inner aperture is the larger, measuring 3/16ths of an inch in long\r\ndiameter, and having the form of a triangle with its base directed\r\nposteriorly. The outer aperture is not more than 1/8th of an inch long.\r\nThe two apertures lie just above the edge of the fold of membrane which\r\nruns from the inner root of the larger or outer branchia, across the\r\nbranchial cavity and beneath the rectum, to the other side.\r\n\r\nThese apertures lead into five sacs, which collectively constitute what\r\nhas been described as the pericardium. The sacs into which the superior\r\napertures open, by a short wide canal with folded walls, are situated on\r\neach side of and above the rectum. Their inner boundaries are separated\r\nby a space of not less than 5/8ths of an inch in width, in which lie\r\nthe vena cava and the oviduct. Each cavity has a rounded circumference,\r\nand a transverse diameter of about half an inch. In a direction at right\r\nangles to this diameter the dimensions vary with its state of\r\ndistension; but a quarter of an inch would be a fair average.\r\n\r\nThe anterior or outer wall of the cavity is formed by the mantle; the\r\nposterior, inner, or visceral wall by a delicate membrane. The former\r\nseparates it from the branchial cavity; the latter from the fifth sac,\r\nto be described by-and-by. I could find no natural aperture in the thin\r\ninner wall, so that I conceive no communication can take place between\r\neither of these sacs and the fifth sac.\r\n\r\nTwo irregular, flattened, brownish, soft plates depend from the\r\nposterior wall of the sac into its cavity; their attached edges are\r\nfixed along a line which is directed from behind obliquely forwards and\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nThe outer and smaller of the inferior apertures on each side leads into\r\na sac of similar dimensions and constitution to the preceding, but\r\nhaving a less rounded outline in consequence of its being flattened in\r\none direction against its fellow of the opposite side, from which it is\r\nseparated only by a delicate membranous wall, whilst on another side it\r\nis applied against the inferior wall of the superior sac, and is in like\r\nmanner separated from it only by a thin and membranous partition.\r\n\r\nLike the upper sacs, each of these has two dark-brown, lamellar,\r\nglandular masses depending from its membranous visceral wall.\r\n\r\nA delicate, but broad, triangular membranous process, about 1/4th of an\r\ninch long, hangs down freely from the visceral wall of the cavity just\r\nbehind the opening of the short canal which connects the sac with its\r\naperture.\r\n\r\nThe third and largest aperture on each side opens directly into a very\r\nlarge fifth cavity, whose boundary is formed anteriorly by the visceral\r\nwalls of the sacs already described, and behind this by the mantle\r\nitself as far as the horny band which marks and connects the insertion\r\nof the shell-muscles.\r\n\r\nIn fact this cavity may be said to be co-extensive with the attached\r\npart of the mantle,--the viscera, enclosed within their delicate\r\n\"peritoneal\" membranous coat, projecting into and nearly filling it, but\r\nnevertheless leaving a clear space between themselves and the delicate\r\nposterior wall of the mantle.\r\n\r\nA layer of the \"peritoneal\" membrane extends from the posterior edge of\r\nthe muscular expansion which lies between the shell-muscles and from the\r\nupper wall of the dilatation of the vena cava, and passes upwards and\r\nbackwards like a diaphragm to the under surfaces of the gizzard and\r\nliver. It is traversed by the aorta, to whose coats it closely adheres.\r\n\r\nAlong a line nearly corresponding with the horny band which proceeds\r\nfrom the insertions of the shell-muscles and encircles the mantle below,\r\nthe pallial wall is produced inwards and forwards into a membranous fold\r\nor ligament, which I will call the pallio-visceral ligament; and this\r\npallio-visceral ligament becoming attached to various viscera, divides\r\nthe great fifth chamber into an anterior inferior, and a posterior\r\nsuperior portion, which communicate freely with one another.\r\n\r\nCommencing with its extreme right-hand end, the ligament is inserted\r\ninto the line of reflection of the mantle, and then into the wall of the\r\noviduct, which becomes enclosed as it were within the ligament. The\r\nlatter then ends in a free edge on the inner side of the oviduct, and is\r\ncontinued along it until it reaches the inferior surface of the apex of\r\nthe ovary, into which it is inserted.\r\n\r\nThe free edge is arcuated; and the rectum passes over it, but is in no\r\nway connected with it.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, is one great passage of communication between the\r\nanterior and posterior divisions of the fifth chamber.\r\n\r\nOn the left side, this aperture is limited by the heart, whose posterior\r\nedge is, on the left side, connected by means of a ligamentous band with\r\nthe surface of the apex of the ovary; but on the right, for the greater\r\npart of its extent, receives a process of the pallio-visceral ligament.\r\nBetween the ovario-cardiac ligament and this process lies the small oval\r\naperture already described by Professor Owen, which gives passage to the\r\nsiphonal artery. It constitutes the middle aperture of communication\r\nbetween the two divisions of the fifth chamber.\r\n\r\nThe left-hand end of the ligament is inserted into the upper wall of the\r\ndilated end of the vena cava; but between this point and the heart it\r\nhas a free arcuated edge, as on the right side.\r\n\r\nThus there are in reality three apertures of communication between the\r\ntwo divisions of the fifth chamber, the middle, by far the smallest,\r\nbeing alone hitherto known.\r\n\r\nA delicate membranous band passes from the whole length of the middle\r\nline of the rectum to the heart and to the ovary.\r\n\r\nThe singular \"pyriform appendage\" of the heart lies in the left process\r\nof the ligament, its anterior edge nearly following the arcuated contour\r\nof that process.\r\n\r\nThe siphuncular process of the mantle was broken in my specimen; but\r\nits aperture appeared to communicate quite freely with the posterior\r\ndivision of the fifth chamber.\r\n\r\nFour sets of brownish, glandular-looking bodies depend into the anterior\r\ndivision of the fifth chamber, from parts of the delicate septa dividing\r\nthis from the four small sacs, corresponding with the insertions of the\r\nglandular bodies above described.\r\n\r\nIn fact, on distending the vena cava with air, it is found that the four\r\nbranchial arteries traverse these septa, and that the appendages in\r\nquestion are diverticula of their walls. Consequently the anterior wall\r\nof each branchial vein is produced into two glandular appendages, which\r\nhang into one of the four smaller sacs, while the posterior wall is\r\nproduced into a single mass of appendages, which hangs into the anterior\r\ndivision of the fifth chamber.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I believe, the five chambers do not communicate directly,\r\nall the appendages must nevertheless be equally bathed with sea-water,\r\nwhich enters by the apertures of the chambers.\r\n\r\nAn impacted yellowish-white concretionary matter filled the anterior\r\nchamber; and a small quantity of it lay as a fine powder at the bottom\r\nof the posterior one. In the latter, however, its presence might, by\r\npossibility, have been accidental. My colleague, Dr. Percy, who kindly\r\nundertook to examine this substance, informs me that he has been unable\r\nto detect uric acid in it. The follicular appendages of the branchial\r\narteries present remarkable differences in their external appearance.\r\nThe eight which hang into the four anterior chambers are similar,\r\nslightly festooned, but otherwise simple lamellæ; while the four which\r\ndepend into the posterior chambers are produced into a number of\r\npapillary processes. This external difference is obvious enough: whether\r\nit be accompanied by a corresponding discrepancy in minute structure I\r\nam unable to say; for I have not as yet been able to arrive at any\r\nsatisfactory results from the microscopic examination of the altered\r\ntissues, and, as will be seen below, the only observer who has had the\r\nopportunity of examining the Nautilus in the fresh state has not noted\r\nany difference of structure in the two sets of follicles.\r\n\r\nOne is naturally led to seek among other mollusks for a structure\r\nanalogous to the vast posterior aquiferous chamber of the Nautilus; and\r\nit appears to me that something quite similar is offered by the\r\n_Ascidioida_ and the _Brachiopoda_. In both cases, the viscera, inclosed\r\nwithin a delicate tissue, project into a large cavity communicating\r\nfreely with the exterior by the cloacal aperture in the one case, and\r\nby the funnel-shaped channels which have been miscalled \"hearts\" in the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe rudimentary renal organs of the Ascidian are developed in the walls\r\nof the cavity in question; and an aquiferous chamber of smaller\r\ndimensions has the same relation to the kidney in Lamellibranchiata--in\r\nGasteropoda, Heteropoda, Pteropoda, and dibranchiate Cephalopoda. But\r\nalthough such is likely enough to be the case, we do not know at present\r\nthat the aquiferous chambers in any of the last named mollusks attain an\r\nextension similar to that which obtains in Nautilus.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the observations detailed above with the statements of\r\nprevious writers, I find that, in his well-known \"Memoir on the Pearly\r\nNautilus\" (1832), Professor Owen describes \"on each side, at the roots\r\nof the branchiæ,\" \"a small mamillary eminence with a transverse slit\r\nwhich conducts from the branchial cavity into the pericardium. There is,\r\nmoreover, a foramen at the lower part of the cavity (_o_, pl. 5)\r\npermitting the escape of a small vessel; and by the side of this vessel\r\na free passage is continued between the gizzard and ovary into the\r\nmembranous tube or siphon that traverses the divisions of the shell,\r\nthus establishing a communication between the interior of that tube and\r\nthe exterior of the animal.\"\r\n\r\nThe foramen here described is easily seen; but, as I have stated, there\r\nare other modes of communication between the so-called pericardium and\r\nthe cavity with which the siphuncle communicates, of a far more\r\nextensive nature.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the pericardium itself, Professor Owen states, \"The\r\nperitoneum, after lining the cavity which contains the crop and liver,\r\nand enveloping those viscera, forms two distinct pouches at the bottom\r\nof the pallial sac, in one of which, the left, is contained the gizzard,\r\nand in the other the ovary; anterior to these, and on the ventral aspect\r\nof the liver, is another distinct cavity, of a square shape, which\r\ncontains the heart and principal vessels, with the glandular appendages\r\nconnected therewith.\" This is what the author terms the pericardium.\r\n\r\nAs Van der Hoeven has pointed out, however, the gizzard lies to the\r\nright and the ovary to the left. Moreover, the gizzard is superior to\r\nthe ovary, so as only to overlap it a little above; and I can find no\r\nevidence of the existence of such distinct pouches as those described.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen states that the branchiæ \"arise by a common peduncle from\r\nthe inner surface of the mantle.\" My own observations, however, and Van\r\nder Hoeven's figures, of both male and female, lead me to believe that\r\nthe peduncles of the branchiæ are perfectly distinct from one another.\r\n\r\nThe follicles of the branchial arteries are thus described in the\r\n\"Memoir on the Pearly Nautilus:\"--\"They are short and pyriform and\r\nclosely set together. To each of the branchial arteries are appended\r\nthree clusters of these glands, of which one is larger than the united\r\nvolume of both the others; and the larger cluster is situated on one\r\nside of the vessel and the two smaller on the opposite side. Each of\r\nthese clusters is contained in a membranous receptacle proper to itself,\r\npartitioned off, as it were, from the pericardium, but communicating\r\nwith it.... The two canals which form the communication between the\r\npericardium and the branchial cavity commence at the receptacle of the\r\nlesser cluster attached to the superior branchial arteries, and\r\nterminate at the papillæ before mentioned, which are situated at the\r\nroots of the branchiæ. The pericardium and these receptacles of the\r\nglands, when first laid open, were found filled with a coagulated\r\nsubstance so closely compacted as to require a careful removal, bit by\r\nbit, before the contained follicles and vessels could be brought into\r\nview.\"\r\n\r\nLike Valenciennes and Van der Hoeven, I have been unable to find any\r\ncommunication between the four sacs in which the small double clusters\r\nof follicles are contained, and the \"pericardium;\" and I hold it to be\r\ncertain that the other four sets of follicles are not contained in sacs\r\nat all, but lie free in the \"pericardium\" or posterior chamber.\r\n\r\nNo notice is here taken of the widely different characters of the\r\nanterior and posterior follicles; and the figure gives both a similar\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nValenciennes (\"Nouvelles Recherches sur le Nautile Flambé,\" 'Archives du\r\nMuséum,' ii., 1841) pointed out the existence of three pairs of\r\napertures opening into the branchial sac, besides the genital and anal\r\nopenings; and he affirms that they open into as many closed sacs, which\r\ncommunicate neither with one another nor with the cavity that contains\r\nthe heart. M. Valenciennes indicates the difference in the structure of\r\nthe anterior and posterior venous appendages. He seems to me to have\r\nseen something of the part which I have described as the pallio-visceral\r\nligament; but I cannot clearly comprehend either his figure or his\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nVan der Hoeven, in his 'Contributions to the Knowledge of the Animal of\r\n_Nautilus pompilius_,' 1850, confirmed the statement of Valenciennes\r\nwith regard to the existence of three pairs of apertures; but he showed,\r\nin opposition to him, that one of these pairs of apertures communicated\r\nwith the pericardium. The sacs into which the other two pairs open are,\r\naccording to this anatomist, blind. In the aperture of the anterior\r\nblind sac he found a concretionary matter which he supposed to contain\r\nuric acid, but chemical analysis did not confirm the supposition. Van\r\nder Hoeven refers to some observations by Vrolik; but as these are in\r\nDutch, and have not, so far as I can find, been translated into either\r\nFrench, German, or English, I know not what they may contain.\r\n\r\nIn his more recent essay, translated in 'Wiegmann's Archiv' for 1857,\r\nunder the title of \"Beitrag zur Anatomie von _Nautilus pompilius_,\" Van\r\nder Hoeven states that he has again found hard concretions in the\r\nchamber enclosing the appendage of the anterior branchial artery, and\r\nthat these on chemical analysis yielded phosphate of lime and traces of\r\nfat and albumen, but no uric acid.\r\n\r\nMr. Macdonald, in a valuable paper on the anatomy of _Nautilus\r\numbilicatus_, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1855, thus\r\ndescribes the follicular appendages of the branchial arteries:--\r\n\r\n\"These follicles are subcylindrical in form, somewhat dilated at the\r\nfree extremity, to which is appended a folded and funnel-shaped process\r\nof membrane, which expands rather suddenly, presenting a jagged and\r\nirregular border. They open by a smooth and oval or slit-like, orifice\r\ninto the afferent pulmonary vessels, on each of which, as Professor Owen\r\nhas observed, they are disposed in three clusters. The outer membrane is\r\nsmooth and glassy, homogeneous in structure and sprinkled over with\r\nminute rounded and transparent bodies, probably the nuclei of cells.\r\nBeneath this layer, flat bundles of fibres, apparently muscular, are\r\ntraceable here and there, principally disposed in a longitudinal\r\ndirection, and sometimes branched. The lining membrane consists of a\r\nloose epithelial pavement in many respects similar to that of the\r\nuriniferous tubules of the higher animals, the cells containing, besides\r\nthe nuclei, numerous minute oil-globules, or a substance much resembling\r\nconcrete fatty matter. This membrane is thrown up into an infinite\r\nnumber of papillæ and corrugations, so as to augment the extent of\r\nsurface considerably. The papillæ are more numerous at the inner part or\r\ntowards the attached end; and a circlet of longitudinally disposed folds\r\nradiate from the bottom of the follicles, in which a number of small\r\npits or fenestrations are sometimes visible. The sides of these folds\r\nare wrinkled transversely so as to present a median zigzag elevation.\r\nThe funnel-shaped membranous process above noticed is continuous with\r\nthe lining membrane, consisting of an extension of the same epithelial\r\npavement; but the cells are somewhat larger and more regular in form.\r\nThe cavity of each follicle, therefore, communicates with the exterior\r\nthrough the centre of this process; and the aperture is thus guarded by\r\na kind of circular valve, permitting the escape of secreted matter, but\r\neffectually preventing the entrance of fluid from without.\"\r\n\r\nIn his fig. 9, pl. xv., Mr. Macdonald depicts certain \"crystalline\r\nbodies often occurring within the follicles.\"\r\n\r\nFrom what Mr. Macdonald states, one would be led to conclude that all\r\nthe follicles have the same structure; but I suspect this to be an\r\noversight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nautilus pompilius._ Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nViewed from the left side and a little behind.\r\n\r\nTwo of the anterior chambers, and the fifth or posterior chamber, laid\r\nopen.

By CHARLES DARWIN,\r\nEsq., F.R.S., F.L.S., & F.G.S., and ALFRED WALLACE, Esq. Communicated by\r\nSir CHARLES LYELL, F.R.S., F.L.S., and J. D. HOOKER, Esq., M.D.,\r\nV.P.R.S., F.L.S., &c.\r\n\r\n[Read July 1st, 1858.]\r\n\r\nLondon, June 30th, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--The accompanying papers, which we have the honour of\r\ncommunicating to the Linnean Society, and which all relate to the same\r\nsubject, viz. the Laws which affect the Production of Varieties, Races,\r\nand Species, contain the results of the investigations of two\r\nindefatigable naturalists, Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Alfred Wallace.\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen having, independently and unknown to one another,\r\nconceived the same very ingenious theory to account for the appearance\r\nand perpetuation of varieties and of specific forms on our planet, may\r\nboth fairly claim the merit of being original thinkers in this important\r\nline of inquiry; but neither of them having published his views, though\r\nMr. Darwin has for many years past been repeatedly urged by us to do so,\r\nand both authors having now unreservedly placed their papers in our\r\nhands, we think it would best promote the interests of science that a\r\nselection from them should be laid before the Linnean Society.\r\n\r\nTaken in the order of their dates, they consist of:--\r\n\r\n1. Extracts from a MS. work on Species[A], by Mr. Darwin, which was\r\nsketched in 1839, and copied in 1844, when the copy was read by Dr.\r\nHooker, and its contents afterwards communicated to Sir Charles Lyell.\r\nThe first Part is devoted to \"The Variation of Organic Beings under\r\nDomestication and in their Natural State;\" and the second chapter of\r\nthat Part, from which we propose to read to the Society the extracts\r\nreferred to, is headed, \"On the Variation of Organic Beings in a state\r\nof Nature; on the Natural Means of Selection; on the Comparison of\r\nDomestic Races and true Species.\"\r\n\r\n2. An abstract of a private letter addressed to Professor Asa Gray, of\r\nBoston, U.S., in October 1857, by Mr. Darwin, in which he repeats his\r\nviews, and which shows that these remained unaltered from 1839 to 1857.\r\n\r\n3. An Essay by Mr. Wallace, entitled \"On the Tendency of Varieties to\r\ndepart indefinitely from the Original Type.\" This was written at Ternate\r\nin February 1858, for the perusal of his friend and correspondent Mr.\r\nDarwin, and sent to him with the expressed wish that it should be\r\nforwarded to Sir Charles Lyell, if Mr. Darwin thought it sufficiently\r\nnovel and interesting. So highly did Mr. Darwin appreciate the value of\r\nthe views therein set forth, that he proposed, in a letter to Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, to obtain Mr. Wallace's consent to allow the Essay to be\r\npublished as soon as possible. Of this step we highly approved, provided\r\nMr. Darwin did not withhold from the public, as he was strongly inclined\r\nto do (in favour of Mr. Wallace), the memoir which he had himself\r\nwritten on the same subject, and which, as before stated, one of us had\r\nperused in 1844, and the contents of which we had both of us been privy\r\nto for many years. On representing this to Mr. Darwin, he gave us\r\npermission to make what use we thought proper of his memoir, &c.; and in\r\nadopting our present course, of presenting it to the Linnean Society, we\r\nhave explained to him that we are not solely considering the relative\r\nclaims to priority of himself and his friend, but the interests of\r\nscience generally; for we feel it to be desirable that views founded on\r\na wide deduction from facts, and matured by years of reflection, should\r\nconstitute at once a goal from which others may start, and that, while\r\nthe scientific world is waiting for the appearance of Mr. Darwin's\r\ncomplete work, some of the leading results of his labours, as well as\r\nthose of his able correspondent, should together be laid before the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nWe have the honour to be yours very obediently,\r\n\r\n                                         CHARLES LYELL.\r\n                                         JOS. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\n_J. J. Bennett, Esq.,_\r\n  _Secretary of the Linnean Society._\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Extract from an unpublished Work on Species, by_ C. DARWIN, Esq.,\r\n_consisting of a portion of a Chapter entitled, \"On the Variation of\r\nOrganic Beings in a state of Nature; on the Natural Means of Selection;\r\non the Comparison of Domestic Races and true Species._\"\r\n\r\nDe Candolle, in an eloquent passage, has declared that all nature is at\r\nwar, one organism with another, or with external nature. Seeing the\r\ncontented face of nature, this may at first well be doubted; but\r\nreflection will inevitably prove it to be true. The war, however, is not\r\nconstant, but recurrent in a slight degree at short periods, and more\r\nseverely at occasional more distant periods; and hence its effects are\r\neasily overlooked. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied in most cases\r\nwith tenfold force. As in every climate there are seasons, for each of\r\nits inhabitants, of greater and less abundance, so all annually breed;\r\nand the moral restraint which in some small degree checks the increase\r\nof mankind is entirely lost. Even slow-breeding mankind has doubled in\r\ntwenty-five years; and if he could increase his food with greater ease,\r\nhe would double in less time. But for animals without artificial means,\r\nthe amount of food for each species must, _on an average_, be constant,\r\nwhereas the increase of all organisms tends to be geometrical, and in a\r\nvast majority of cases at an enormous ratio. Suppose in a certain spot\r\nthere are eight pairs of birds, and that _only_ four pairs of them\r\nannually (including double hatches) rear only four young, and that these\r\ngo on rearing their young at the same rate, then at the end of seven\r\nyears (a short life, excluding violent deaths, for any bird) there will\r\nbe 2048 birds, instead of the original sixteen. As this increase is\r\nquite impossible, we must conclude either that birds do not rear nearly\r\nhalf their young, or that the average life of a bird is, from accident,\r\nnot nearly seven years. Both checks probably concur. The same kind of\r\ncalculation applied to all plants and animals affords results more or\r\nless striking, but in very few instances more striking than in man.\r\n\r\nMany practical illustrations of this rapid tendency to increase are on\r\nrecord, among which, during peculiar seasons, are the extraordinary\r\nnumbers of certain animals; for instance, during the years 1826 to 1828,\r\nin La Plata, when from drought some millions of cattle perished, the\r\nwhole country actually _swarmed_ with mice. Now I think it cannot be\r\ndoubted that during the breeding-season all the mice (with the exception\r\nof a few males or females in excess) ordinarily pair, and therefore that\r\nthis astounding increase during three years must be attributed to a\r\ngreater number than usual surviving the first year, and then breeding,\r\nand so on till the third year, when their numbers were brought down to\r\ntheir usual limits on the return of wet weather. Where man has\r\nintroduced plants and animals into a new and favourable country, there\r\nare many accounts in how surprisingly few years the whole country has\r\nbecome stocked with them. This increase would necessarily stop as soon\r\nas the country was fully stocked; and yet we have every reason to\r\nbelieve, from what is known of wild animals, that _all_ would pair in\r\nthe spring. In the majority of cases it is most difficult to imagine\r\nwhere the checks fall--though generally, no doubt, on the seeds, eggs,\r\nand young; but when we remember how impossible, even in mankind (so much\r\nbetter known than any other animal), it is to infer from repeated casual\r\nobservations what the average duration of life is, or to discover the\r\ndifferent percentage of deaths to births in different countries, we\r\nought to feel no surprise at our being unable to discover where the\r\ncheck falls in any animal or plant. It should always be remembered, that\r\nin most cases the checks are recurrent yearly in a small, regular\r\ndegree, and in an extreme degree during unusually cold, hot, dry, or wet\r\nyears, according to the constitution of the being in question. Lighten\r\nany check in the least degree, and the geometrical powers of increase in\r\nevery organism will almost instantly increase the average number of the\r\nfavoured species. Nature may be compared to a surface on which rest ten\r\nthousand sharp wedges touching each other and driven inwards by\r\nincessant blows. Fully to realize these views much reflection is\r\nrequisite. Malthus on man should be studied; and all such cases as those\r\nof the mice in La Plata, of the cattle and horses when first turned out\r\nin South America, of the birds by our calculation, &c., should be well\r\nconsidered. Reflect on the enormous multiplying power _inherent and\r\nannually in action_ in all animals; reflect on the countless seeds\r\nscattered by a hundred ingenious contrivances, year after year, over the\r\nwhole face of the land; and yet we have every reason to suppose that the\r\naverage percentage of each of the inhabitants of a country usually\r\nremains constant. Finally, let it be borne in mind that this average\r\nnumber of individuals (the external conditions remaining the same) in\r\neach country is kept up by recurrent struggles against other species or\r\nagainst external nature (as on the borders of the Arctic regions, where\r\nthe cold checks life), and that ordinarily each individual of every\r\nspecies holds its place, either by its own struggle and capacity of\r\nacquiring nourishment in some period of its life, from the egg upwards;\r\nor by the struggle of its parents (in short-lived organisms, when the\r\nmain check occurs at longer intervals) with other individuals of the\r\n_same_ or _different_ species.\r\n\r\nBut let the external conditions of a country alter. If in a small\r\ndegree, the relative proportions of the inhabitants will in most cases\r\nsimply be slightly changed; but let the number of inhabitants be small,\r\nas on an island, and free access to it from other countries be\r\ncircumscribed, and let the change of conditions continue progressing\r\n(forming new stations), in such a case the original inhabitants must\r\ncease to be as perfectly adapted to the changed conditions as they were\r\noriginally. It has been shown in a former part of this work, that such\r\nchanges of external conditions would, from their acting on the\r\nreproductive system, probably cause the organization of those beings\r\nwhich were most affected to become, as under domestication, plastic.\r\nNow, can it be doubted, from the struggle each individual has to obtain\r\nsubsistence, that any minute variation in structure, habits, or\r\ninstincts, adapting that individual better to the new conditions, would\r\ntell upon its vigour and health? In the struggle it would have a better\r\n_chance_ of surviving; and those of its offspring which inherited the\r\nvariation, be it ever so slight, would also have a better _chance_.\r\nYearly more are bred than can survive; the smallest grain in the\r\nbalance, in the long run, must tell on which death shall fall, and which\r\nshall survive. Let this work of selection on the one hand, and death on\r\nthe other, go on for a thousand generations, who will pretend to affirm\r\nthat it would produce no effect, when we remember what, in a few years,\r\nBakewell effected in cattle, and Western in sheep, by this identical\r\nprinciple of selection?\r\n\r\nTo give an imaginary example from changes in progress on an island:--let\r\nthe organization of a canine animal which preyed chiefly on rabbits, but\r\nsometimes on hares, become slightly plastic; let these same changes\r\ncause the number of rabbits very slowly to decrease, and the number of\r\nhares to increase; the effect of this would be that the fox or dog would\r\nbe driven to try to catch more hares: his organization, however, being\r\nslightly plastic, those individuals with the lightest forms, longest\r\nlimbs, and best eyesight, let the difference be ever so small, would be\r\nslightly favoured, and would tend to live longer, and to survive during\r\nthat time of the year when food was scarcest; they would also rear more\r\nyoung, which would tend to inherit these slight peculiarities. The less\r\nfleet ones would be rigidly destroyed. I can see no more reason to doubt\r\nthat these causes in a thousand generations would produce a marked\r\neffect, and adapt the form of the fox or dog to the catching of hares\r\ninstead of rabbits, than that greyhounds can be improved by selection\r\nand careful breeding. So would it be with plants under similar\r\ncircumstances. If the number of individuals of a species with plumed\r\nseeds could be increased by greater powers of dissemination within its\r\nown area (that is, if the check to increase fell chiefly on the seeds),\r\nthose seeds which were provided with ever so little more down, would in\r\nthe long run be most disseminated; hence a greater number of seeds thus\r\nformed would germinate, and would tend to produce plants inheriting the\r\nslightly better-adapted down[B].\r\n\r\nBesides this natural means of selection, by which those individuals are\r\npreserved, whether in their egg, or larval, or mature state, which are\r\nbest adapted to the place they fill in nature, there is a second agency\r\nat work in most unisexual animals, tending to produce the same effect,\r\nnamely, the struggle of the males for the females. These struggles are\r\ngenerally decided by the law of battle, but in the case of birds,\r\napparently, by the charms of their song, by their beauty or their power\r\nof courtship, as in the dancing rock-thrush of Guiana. The most vigorous\r\nand healthy males, implying perfect adaptation, must generally gain the\r\nvictory in their contests. This kind of selection, however, is less\r\nrigorous than the other; it does not require the death of the less\r\nsuccessful, but gives to them fewer descendants. The struggle falls,\r\nmoreover, at a time of year when food is generally abundant, and perhaps\r\nthe effect chiefly produced would be the modification of the secondary\r\nsexual characters, which are not related to the power of obtaining food,\r\nor to defence from enemies, but to fighting with or rivalling other\r\nmales. The result of this struggle amongst the males may be compared in\r\nsome respects to that produced by those agriculturists who pay less\r\nattention to the careful selection of all their young animals, and more\r\nto the occasional use of a choice mate.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Abstract of a Letter from_ C. DARWIN, Esq., _to_ Prof. ASA GRAY,\r\n_Boston, U.S., dated Down, September 5th, 1857._\r\n\r\n1. It is wonderful what the principle of selection by man, that is the\r\npicking out of individuals with any desired quality, and breeding from\r\nthem, and again picking out, can do. Even breeders have been astounded\r\nat their own results. They can act on differences inappreciable to an\r\nuneducated eye. Selection has been _methodically_ followed in _Europe_\r\nfor only the last half century; but it was occasionally, and even in\r\nsome degree methodically, followed in the most ancient times. There must\r\nhave been also a kind of unconscious selection from a remote period,\r\nnamely in the preservation of the individual animals (without any\r\nthought of their offspring) most useful to each race of man in his\r\nparticular circumstances. The \"roguing,\" as nurserymen call the\r\ndestroying of varieties which depart from their type, is a kind of\r\nselection. I am convinced that intentional and occasional selection has\r\nbeen the main agent in the production of our domestic races; but however\r\nthis may be, its great power of modification has been indisputably shown\r\nin later times. Selection acts only by the accumulation of slight or\r\ngreater variations, caused by external conditions, or by the mere fact\r\nthat in generation the child is not absolutely similar to its parent.\r\nMan, by this power of accumulating variations, adapts living beings to\r\nhis wants--may be said to make the wool of one sheep good for carpets,\r\nof another for cloth, &c.\r\n\r\n2. Now suppose there were a being who did not judge by mere external\r\nappearances, but who could study the whole internal organization, who\r\nwas never capricious, and should go on selecting for one object during\r\nmillions of generations; who will say what he might not effect? In\r\nnature we have some _slight_ variation occasionally in all parts; and I\r\nthink it can be shown that changed conditions of existence is the main\r\ncause of the child not exactly resembling its parents; and in nature\r\ngeology shows us what changes have taken place, and are taking place. We\r\nhave almost unlimited time; no one but a practical geologist can fully\r\nappreciate this. Think of the Glacial period, during the whole of which\r\nthe same species at least of shells have existed; there must have been\r\nduring this period millions on millions of generations.\r\n\r\n3. I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring power at work\r\nin _Natural Selection_ (the title of my book), which selects exclusively\r\nfor the good of each organic being. The elder De Candolle, W. Herbert,\r\nand Lyell have written excellently on the struggle for life; but even\r\nthey have not written strongly enough. Reflect that every being (even\r\nthe elephant) breeds at such a rate, that in a few years, or at most a\r\nfew centuries, the surface of the earth would not hold the progeny of\r\none pair. I have found it hard constantly to bear in mind that the\r\nincrease of every single species is checked during some part of its\r\nlife, or during some shortly recurrent generation. Only a few of those\r\nannually born can live to propagate their kind. What a trifling\r\ndifference must often determine which shall survive, and which perish!\r\n\r\n4. Now take the case of a country undergoing some change. This will tend\r\nto cause some of its inhabitants to vary slightly--not but that I\r\nbelieve most beings vary at all times enough for selection to act on\r\nthem. Some of its inhabitants will be exterminated; and the remainder\r\nwill be exposed to the mutual action of a different set of inhabitants,\r\nwhich I believe to be far more important to the life of each being than\r\nmere climate. Considering the infinitely various methods which living\r\nbeings follow to obtain food by struggling with other organisms, to\r\nescape danger at various times of life, to have their eggs or seeds\r\ndisseminated, &c. &c., I cannot doubt that during millions of\r\ngenerations individuals of a species will be occasionally born with some\r\nslight variation, profitable to some part of their economy. Such\r\nindividuals will have a better chance of surviving, and of propagating\r\ntheir new and slightly different structure; and the modification may be\r\nslowly increased by the accumulative action of natural selection to any\r\nprofitable extent. The variety thus formed will either coexist with, or,\r\nmore commonly, will exterminate its parent form. An organic being, like\r\nthe woodpecker or misseltoe, may thus come to be adapted to a score of\r\ncontingences--natural selection accumulating those slight variations in\r\nall parts of its structure, which are in any way useful to it during any\r\npart of its life.\r\n\r\n5. Multiform difficulties will occur to every one, with respect to this\r\ntheory. Many can, I think, be satisfactorily answered. _Natura non facit\r\nsaltum_ answers some of the most obvious. The slowness of the change,\r\nand only a very few individuals undergoing change at any one time,\r\nanswers others. The extreme imperfection of our geological records\r\nanswers others.\r\n\r\n6. Another principle, which may be called the principle of divergence,\r\nplays, I believe, an important part in the origin of species. The same\r\nspot will support more life if occupied by very diverse forms. We see\r\nthis in the many generic forms in a square yard of turf, and in the\r\nplants or insects on any little uniform islet, belonging almost\r\ninvariably to as many genera and families as species. We can understand\r\nthe meaning of this fact amongst the higher animals, whose habits we\r\nunderstand. We know that it has been experimentally shown that a plot of\r\nland will yield a greater weight if sown with several species and genera\r\nof grasses, than if sown with only two or three species. Now, every\r\norganic being, by propagating so rapidly, may be said to be striving its\r\nutmost to increase in numbers. So it will be with the offspring of any\r\nspecies after it has become diversified into varieties, or subspecies,\r\nor true species. And it follows, I think, from the foregoing facts, that\r\nthe varying offspring of each species will try (only few will succeed)\r\nto seize on as many and as diverse places in the economy of nature as\r\npossible. Each new variety or species, when formed, will generally take\r\nthe place of, and thus exterminate its less well-fitted parent. This I\r\nbelieve to be the origin of the classification and affinities of organic\r\nbeings at all times; for organic beings always _seem_ to branch and\r\nsub-branch like the limbs of a tree from a common trunk, the flourishing\r\nand diverging twigs destroying the less vigorous--the dead and lost\r\nbranches rudely representing extinct genera and families.\r\n\r\nThis sketch is _most_ imperfect; but in so short a space I cannot make\r\nit better. Your imagination must fill up very wide blanks.\r\n\r\nC. DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the\r\nOriginal Type._ By ALFRED RUSSELL WALLACE.\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest arguments which have been adduced to prove the\r\noriginal and permanent distinctness of species is, that _varieties_\r\nproduced in a state of domesticity are more or less unstable, and often\r\nhave a tendency, if left to themselves, to return to the normal form of\r\nthe parent species; and this instability is considered to be a\r\ndistinctive peculiarity of all varieties, even of those occurring among\r\nwild animals in a state of nature, and to constitute a provision for\r\npreserving unchanged the originally created distinct species.\r\n\r\nIn the absence or scarcity of facts and observations as to _varieties_\r\noccurring among wild animals, this argument has had great weight with\r\nnaturalists, and has led to a very general and somewhat prejudiced\r\nbelief in the stability of species. Equally general, however, is the\r\nbelief in what are called \"permanent or true varieties,\"--races of\r\nanimals which continually propagate their like, but which differ so\r\nslightly (although constantly) from some other race, that the one is\r\nconsidered to be a _variety_ of the other. Which is the _variety_ and\r\nwhich the original _species_, there is generally no means of\r\ndetermining, except in those rare cases in which the one race has been\r\nknown to produce an offspring unlike itself and resembling the other.\r\nThis, however, would seem quite incompatible with the \"permanent\r\ninvariability of species,\" but the difficulty is overcome by assuming\r\nthat such varieties have strict limits, and can never again vary further\r\nfrom the original type, although they may return to it, which, from the\r\nanalogy of the domesticated animals, is considered to be highly\r\nprobable, if not certainly proved.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this argument rests entirely on the assumption,\r\nthat _varieties_ occurring in a state of nature are in all respects\r\nanalogous to or even identical with those of domestic animals, and are\r\ngoverned by the same laws as regards their permanence or further\r\nvariation. But it is the object of the present paper to show that this\r\nassumption is altogether false, that there is a general principle in\r\nnature which will cause many _varieties_ to survive the parent species,\r\nand to give rise to successive variations departing further and further\r\nfrom the original type, and which also produces, in domesticated\r\nanimals, the tendency of varieties to return to the parent form.\r\n\r\nThe life of wild animals is a struggle for existence. The full exertion\r\nof all their faculties and all their energies is required to preserve\r\ntheir own existence and provide for that of their infant offspring. The\r\npossibility of procuring food during the least favourable seasons, and\r\nof escaping the attacks of their most dangerous enemies, are the primary\r\nconditions which determine the existence both of individuals and of\r\nentire species. These conditions will also determine the population of a\r\nspecies; and by a careful consideration of all the circumstances we may\r\nbe enabled to comprehend, and in some degree to explain, what at first\r\nsight appears so inexplicable--the excessive abundance of some species,\r\nwhile others closely allied to them are very rare.\r\n\r\nThe general proportion that must obtain between certain groups of\r\nanimals is readily seen. Large animals cannot be so abundant as small\r\nones; the carnivora must be less numerous than the herbivora; eagles and\r\nlions can never be so plentiful as pigeons and antelopes; the wild asses\r\nof the Tartarian deserts cannot equal in numbers the horses of the more\r\nluxuriant prairies and pampas of America. The greater or less fecundity\r\nof an animal is often considered to be one of the chief causes of its\r\nabundance or scarcity; but a consideration of the facts will show us\r\nthat it really has little or nothing to do with the matter. Even the\r\nleast prolific of animals would increase rapidly if unchecked, whereas\r\nit is evident that the animal population of the globe must be\r\nstationary, or perhaps, through the influence of man, decreasing.\r\nFluctuations there may be; but permanent increase, except in restricted\r\nlocalities, is almost impossible. For example, our own observation must\r\nconvince us that birds do not go on increasing every year in a\r\ngeometrical ratio, as they would do, were there not some powerful check\r\nto their natural increase. Very few birds produce less than two young\r\nones each year, while many have six, eight, or ten; four will certainly\r\nbe below the average; and if we suppose that each pair produce young\r\nonly four times in their life, that will also be below the average,\r\nsupposing them not to die either by violence or want of food. Yet at\r\nthis rate how tremendous would be the increase in a few years from a\r\nsingle pair! A simple calculation will show that in fifteen years each\r\npair of birds would have increased to nearly ten millions! whereas we\r\nhave no reason to believe that the number of the birds of any country\r\nincreases at all in fifteen or in one hundred and fifty years. With such\r\npowers of increase the population must have reached its limits, and have\r\nbecome stationary, in a very low years after the origin of each species.\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that each year an immense number of birds must\r\nperish--as many in fact as are born; and as on the lowest calculation\r\nthe progeny are each year twice as numerous as their parents, it follows\r\nthat, whatever be the average number of individuals existing in any\r\ngiven country, _twice that number must perish annually_,--a striking\r\nresult, but one which seems at least highly probable, and is perhaps\r\nunder rather than over the truth. It would therefore appear that, as far\r\nas the continuance of the species and the keeping up the average number\r\nof individuals are concerned, large broods are superfluous. On the\r\naverage all above _one_ become food for hawks and kites, wild cats and\r\nweasels, or perish of cold and hunger as winter comes on. This is\r\nstrikingly proved by the case of particular species; for we find that\r\ntheir abundance in individuals bears no relation whatever to their\r\nfertility in producing offspring. Perhaps the most remarkable instance\r\nof an immense bird population is that of the passenger pigeon of the\r\nUnited States, which lays only one, or at most two eggs, and is said to\r\nrear generally but one young one. Why is this bird so extraordinarily\r\nabundant, while others producing two or three times as many young are\r\nmuch less plentiful? The explanation is not difficult. The food most\r\ncongenial to this species, and on which it thrives best, is abundantly\r\ndistributed over a very extensive region, offering such differences of\r\nsoil and climate, that in one part or another of the area the supply\r\nnever fails. The bird is capable of a very rapid and long-continued\r\nflight, so that it can pass without fatigue over the whole of the\r\ndistrict it inhabits, and as soon as the supply of food begins to fail\r\nin one place is able to discover a fresh feeding-ground. This example\r\nstrikingly shows us that the procuring a constant supply of wholesome\r\nfood is almost the sole condition requisite for ensuring the rapid\r\nincrease of a given species, since neither the limited fecundity, nor\r\nthe unrestrained attacks of birds of prey and of man are here sufficient\r\nto check it. In no other birds are these peculiar circumstances so\r\nstrikingly combined. Either their food is more liable to failure, or\r\nthey have not sufficient power of wing to search for it over an\r\nextensive area, or during some season of the year it becomes very\r\nscarce, and less wholesome substitutes have to be found; and thus,\r\nthough more fertile in offspring, they can never increase beyond the\r\nsupply of food in the least favourable seasons. Many birds can only\r\nexist by migrating, when their food becomes scarce, to regions\r\npossessing a milder, or at least a different climate, though, as these\r\nmigrating birds are seldom excessively abundant, it is evident that the\r\ncountries they visit are still deficient in a constant and abundant\r\nsupply of wholesome food. Those whose organization does not permit them\r\nto migrate when their food becomes periodically scarce, can never attain\r\na large population. This is probably the reason why woodpeckers are\r\nscarce with us, while in the tropics they are among the most abundant of\r\nsolitary birds. Thus the house sparrow is more abundant than the\r\nredbreast, because its food is more constant and plentiful,--seeds of\r\ngrasses being preserved during the winter, and our farm-yards and\r\nstubble-fields furnishing an almost inexhaustible supply. Why, as a\r\ngeneral rule, are aquatic, and especially sea birds, very numerous in\r\nindividuals? Not because they are more prolific than others, generally\r\nthe contrary; but because their food never fails, the sea-shores and\r\nriver-banks daily swarming with a fresh supply of small mollusca and\r\ncrustacea. Exactly the same laws will apply to mammals. Wild cats are\r\nprolific and have few enemies; why then are they never as abundant as\r\nrabbits? The only intelligible answer is, that their supply of food is\r\nmore precarious. It appears evident, therefore, that so long as a\r\ncountry remains physically unchanged, the numbers of its animal\r\npopulation cannot materially increase. If one species does so, some\r\nothers requiring the same kind of food must diminish in proportion. The\r\nnumbers that die annually must be immense; and as the individual\r\nexistence of each animal depends upon itself, those that die must be the\r\nweakest--the very young, the aged, and the diseased,--while those that\r\nprolong their existence can only be the most perfect in health and\r\nvigour--those who are best able to obtain food regularly, and avoid\r\ntheir numerous enemies. It is, as we commenced by remarking, \"a struggle\r\nfor existence,\" in which the weakest and least perfectly organized must\r\nalways succumb.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that what takes place among the individuals of a species\r\nmust also occur among the several allied species of a group,--viz. that\r\nthose which are best adapted to obtain a regular supply of food, and to\r\ndefend themselves against the attacks of their enemies and the\r\nvicissitudes of the seasons, must necessarily obtain and preserve a\r\nsuperiority in population; while those species which from some defect of\r\npower or organization are the least capable of counteracting the\r\nvicissitudes of food, supply, &c., must diminish in numbers, and, in\r\nextreme cases, become altogether extinct. Between these extremes the\r\nspecies will present various degrees of capacity for ensuring the means\r\nof preserving life; and it is thus we account for the abundance or\r\nrarity of species. Our ignorance will generally prevent us from\r\naccurately tracing the effects to their causes; but could we become\r\nperfectly acquainted with the organization and habits of the various\r\nspecies of animals, and could we measure the capacity of each for\r\nperforming the different acts necessary to its safety and existence\r\nunder all the varying circumstances by which it is surrounded, we might\r\nbe able even to calculate the proportionate abundance of individuals\r\nwhich is the necessary result.\r\n\r\nIf now we have succeeded in establishing these two points--1st, _that\r\nthe animal population of a country is generally stationary, being kept\r\ndown by a periodical deficiency of food, and other checks_; and, 2nd,\r\n_that the comparative abundance or scarcity of the individuals of the\r\nseveral species is entirely due to their organization and resulting\r\nhabits, which, rendering it more difficult to procure a regular supply\r\nof food and to provide for their personal safety in some cases than in\r\nothers, can only be balanced by a difference in the population which\r\nhave to exist in a given area_--we shall be in a condition to proceed to\r\nthe consideration of _varieties_, to which the preceding remarks have a\r\ndirect and very important application.\r\n\r\nMost or perhaps all the variations from the typical form of a species\r\nmust have some definite effect, however slight, on the habits or\r\ncapacities of the individuals. Even a change of colour might, by\r\nrendering them more or less distinguishable, affect their safety; a\r\ngreater or less development of hair might modify their habits. More\r\nimportant changes, such as an increase in the power or dimensions of the\r\nlimbs or any of the external organs, would more or less affect their\r\nmode of procuring food or the range of country which they inhabit. It\r\nis also evident that most changes would affect, either favourably or\r\nadversely, the powers of prolonging existence. An antelope with shorter\r\nor weaker legs must necessarily suffer more from the attacks of the\r\nfeline carnivora; the passenger pigeon with less powerful wings would\r\nsooner or later be affected in its powers of procuring a regular supply\r\nof food; and in both cases the result must necessarily be a diminution\r\nof the population of the modified species. If, on the other hand, any\r\nspecies should produce a variety having slightly increased powers of\r\npreserving existence, that variety must inevitably in time acquire a\r\nsuperiority in numbers. These results must follow as surely as old age,\r\nintemperance, or scarcity of food produce an increased mortality. In\r\nboth cases there may be many individual exceptions; but on the average\r\nthe rule will invariably be found to hold good. All varieties will\r\ntherefore fall into two classes--those which under the same conditions\r\nwould never reach the population of the parent species, and those which\r\nwould in time obtain and keep a numerical superiority. Now, let some\r\nalteration of physical conditions occur in the district--a long period\r\nof drought, a destruction of vegetation by locusts, the irruption of\r\nsome new carnivorous animal seeking \"pastures new\"--any change in fact\r\ntending to render existence more difficult to the species in question,\r\nand tasking its utmost powers to avoid complete extermination; it is\r\nevident that, of all the individuals composing the species, those\r\nforming the least numerous and most feebly organized variety would\r\nsuffer first, and, were the pressure severe, must soon become extinct.\r\nThe same causes continuing in action, the parent species would next\r\nsuffer, would gradually diminish in numbers, and with a recurrence of\r\nsimilar unfavourable conditions might also become extinct. The superior\r\nvariety would then alone remain, and on a return to favourable\r\ncircumstances would rapidly increase in numbers and occupy the place of\r\nthe extinct species and variety.\r\n\r\nThe _variety_ would now have replaced the _species_, of which it would\r\nbe a more perfectly developed and more highly organized form. It would\r\nbe in all respects better adapted to secure its safety, and to prolong\r\nits individual existence and that of the race. Such a variety _could\r\nnot_ return to the original form; for that form is an inferior one, and\r\ncould never compete with it for existence. Granted, therefore, a\r\n\"tendency\" to reproduce the original type of the species, still the\r\nvariety must ever remain preponderant in numbers, and under adverse\r\nphysical conditions _again alone survive_. But this new, improved, and\r\npopulous race might itself, in course of time, give rise to new\r\nvarieties, exhibiting several diverging modifications of form, any of\r\nwhich, tending to increase the facilities for preserving existence,\r\nmust, by the same general law, in their turn become predominant. Here,\r\nthen, we have _progression and continued divergence_ deduced from the\r\ngeneral laws which regulate the existence of animals in a state of\r\nnature, and from the undisputed fact that varieties do frequently occur.\r\nIt is not, however, contended that this result would be invariable; a\r\nchange of physical conditions in the district might at times materially\r\nmodify it, rendering the race which had been the most capable of\r\nsupporting existence under the former conditions now the least so, and\r\neven causing the extinction of the newer and, for a time, superior race,\r\nwhile the old or parent species and its first inferior varieties\r\ncontinued to flourish. Variations in unimportant parts might also occur,\r\nhaving no perceptible effect on the life-preserving powers; and the\r\nvarieties so furnished might run a course parallel with the parent\r\nspecies, either giving rise to further variations or returning to the\r\nformer type. All we argue for is, that certain varieties have a tendency\r\nto maintain their existence longer than the original species, and this\r\ntendency must make itself felt; for though the doctrine of chances or\r\naverages can never be trusted to on a limited scale, yet, if applied to\r\nhigh numbers, the results come nearer to what theory demands, and, as we\r\napproach to an infinity of examples, become strictly accurate. Now the\r\nscale on which nature works is so vast--the numbers of individuals and\r\nperiods of time with which she deals approach so near to infinity, that\r\nany cause, however slight, and however liable to be veiled and\r\ncounteracted by accidental circumstances, must in the end produce its\r\nfull legitimate results.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to domesticated animals, and inquire how varieties\r\nproduced among them are affected by the principles here enunciated. The\r\nessential difference in the condition of wild and domestic animals is\r\nthis,--that among the former, their well-being and very existence depend\r\nupon the full exercise and healthy condition of all their senses and\r\nphysical powers, whereas, among the latter, these are only partially\r\nexercised, and in some cases are absolutely unused. A wild animal has to\r\nsearch, and often to labour, for every mouthful of food--to exercise\r\nsight, hearing, and smell in seeking it, and in avoiding dangers, in\r\nprocuring shelter from the inclemency of the seasons, and in providing\r\nfor the subsistence and safety of its offspring. There is no muscle of\r\nits body that is not called into daily and hourly activity; there is no\r\nsense or faculty that is not strengthened by continual exercise. The\r\ndomestic animal, on the other hand, has food provided for it, is\r\nsheltered, and often confined, to guard it against the vicissitudes of\r\nthe seasons, is carefully secured from the attacks of its natural\r\nenemies, and seldom even rears its young without human assistance. Half\r\nof its senses and faculties are quite useless; and the other half are\r\nbut occasionally called into feeble exercise, while even its muscular\r\nsystem is only irregularly called into action.\r\n\r\nNow when a variety of such an animal occurs, having increased power or\r\ncapacity in any organ or sense, such increase is totally useless, is\r\nnever called into action, and may even exist without the animal ever\r\nbecoming aware of it. In the wild animal, on the contrary, all its\r\nfaculties and powers being brought into full action for the necessities\r\nof existence, any increase becomes immediately available, is\r\nstrengthened by exercise, and must even slightly modify the food, the\r\nhabits, and the whole economy of the race. It creates as it were a new\r\nanimal, one of superior powers, and which will necessarily increase in\r\nnumbers and outlive those inferior to it.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the domesticated animal all variations have an equal chance of\r\ncontinuance; and those which would decidedly render a wild animal unable\r\nto compete with its fellows and continue its existence are no\r\ndisadvantage whatever in a state of domesticity. Our quickly fattening\r\npigs, short-legged sheep, pouter pigeons, and poodle dogs could never\r\nhave come into existence in a state of nature, because the very first\r\nstep towards such inferior forms would have led to the rapid extinction\r\nof the race; still less could they now exist in competition with their\r\nwild allies. The great speed but slight endurance of the race horse, the\r\nunwieldy strength of the ploughman's team, would both be useless in a\r\nstate of nature. If turned wild on the pampas, such animals would\r\nprobably soon become extinct, or under favourable circumstances might\r\neach lose those extreme qualities which would never be called into\r\naction, and in a few generations would revert to a common type, which\r\nmust be that in which the various powers and faculties are so\r\nproportioned to each other as to be best adapted to procure food and\r\nsecure safety,--that in which by the full exercise of every part of his\r\norganization the animal can alone continue to live. Domestic varieties,\r\nwhen turned wild, _must_ return to something near the type of the\r\noriginal wild stock, _or become altogether extinct_.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that no inferences as to varieties in a state of nature\r\ncan be deduced from the observation of those occurring among domestic\r\nanimals. The two are so much opposed to each other in every circumstance\r\nof their existence, that what applies to the one is almost sure not to\r\napply to the other. Domestic animals are abnormal, irregular,\r\nartificial; they are subject to varieties which never occur and never\r\ncan occur in a state of nature: their very existence depends altogether\r\non human care; so far are many of them removed from that just proportion\r\nof faculties, that true balance of organization, by means of which alone\r\nan animal left to its own resources can preserve its existence and\r\ncontinue its race.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of Lamarck--that progressive changes in species have been\r\nproduced by the attempts of animals to increase the development of their\r\nown organs, and thus modify their structure and habits--has been\r\nrepeatedly and easily refuted by all writers on the subject of varieties\r\nand species, and it seems to have been considered that when this was\r\ndone the whole question has been finally settled; but the view here\r\ndeveloped renders such an hypothesis quite unnecessary, by showing that\r\nsimilar results must be produced by the action of principles constantly\r\nat work in nature. The powerful retractile talons of the falcon- and the\r\ncat-tribes have not been produced or increased by the volition of those\r\nanimals; but among the different varieties which occurred in the earlier\r\nand less highly organized forms of these groups, _those always survived\r\nlongest which had the greatest facilities for seizing their prey_.\r\nNeither did the giraffe acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the\r\nfoliage of the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck for\r\nthe purpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its\r\nantitypes with a longer neck than usual _at once secured a fresh range\r\nof pasture over the same ground as their shorter-necked companions, and\r\non the first scarcity of food were thereby enabled to outlive them_.\r\nEven the peculiar colours of many animals, especially insects, so\r\nclosely resembling the soil or the leaves or the trunks on which they\r\nhabitually reside, are explained on the same principle; for though in\r\nthe course of ages varieties of many tints may have occurred, _yet those\r\nraces having colours best adapted to concealment from their enemies\r\nwould inevitably survive the longest_. We have also here an acting cause\r\nto account for that balance so often observed in nature,--a deficiency\r\nin one set of organs always being compensated by an increased\r\ndevelopment of some others--powerful wings accompanying weak feet, or\r\ngreat velocity making up for the absence of defensive weapons; for it\r\nhas been shown that all varieties in which an unbalanced deficiency\r\noccurred could not long continue their existence. The action of this\r\nprinciple is exactly like that of the centrifugal governor of the steam\r\nengine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they\r\nbecome evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the\r\nanimal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it\r\nwould make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence\r\ndifficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow. An origin such as\r\nis here advocated will also agree with the peculiar character of the\r\nmodifications of form and structure which obtain in organized\r\nbeings--the many lines of divergence from a central type, the increasing\r\nefficiency and power of a particular organ through a succession of\r\nallied species, and the remarkable persistence of unimportant parts such\r\nas colour, texture of plumage and hair, form of horns or crests, through\r\na series of species differing considerably in more essential characters.\r\nIt also furnishes us with a reason for that \"more specialized structure\"\r\nwhich Professor Owen states to be a characteristic of recent compared\r\nwith extinct forms, and which would evidently be the result of the\r\nprogressive modification of any organ applied to a special purpose in\r\nthe animal economy.\r\n\r\nWe believe we have now shown that there is a tendency in nature to the\r\ncontinued progression of certain classes of _varieties_ further and\r\nfurther from the original type--a progression to which there appears no\r\nreason to assign any definite limits--and that the same principle which\r\nproduces this result in a state of nature will also explain why domestic\r\nvarieties have a tendency to revert to the original type. This\r\nprogression, by minute steps, in various directions, but always checked\r\nand balanced by the necessary conditions, subject to which alone\r\nexistence can be preserved, may, it is believed, be followed out so as\r\nto agree with all the phenomena presented by organized beings, their\r\nextinction and succession in past ages, and all the extraordinary\r\nmodifications of form, instinct, and habits which they exhibit.\r\n\r\nTernate, February, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] This MS. work was never intended for publication, and therefore was\r\nnot written with care.--C.

Communicated by the Secretary.\r\n\r\n[Received Oct. 6, 1857.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPart I. THE DOLPHINS.\r\n\r\nThe dissection of the Cetacea, and more especially of the larger kinds,\r\nis attended with great difficulty, and not unfrequently entails heavy\r\nexpenses on those who attempt it. For these reasons I have thought that\r\nzoologists might be pleased to have, even now, submitted to them the\r\nresults of numerous dissections made many years ago, when, not stinted\r\nin means, and having the aid of excellent assistants, I attempted the\r\ndissection even of the gigantic Arctic Rorqual, the largest, perhaps, of\r\nall living beings. Certain of the details have been from time to time\r\nlaid before the public, but in an extremely scattered and incomplete\r\nform, and without the illustrations (artistic), which explain so much\r\nbetter than any verbal description. The greater part is still before me\r\nin manuscript. It is my intention in the following contributions to\r\nendeavour to connect them together, adding to those already published\r\nmany facts I find in MSS. The original drawings, made by my brother and\r\nby Messrs. Edward Forbes and Henry Goodsir (who were at that time my\r\nstudents and assistants), are still in my possession.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Species._--The determination of species as regards the\r\n_Cetacea_ is one of much difficulty; Cuvier met this difficulty by an\r\nappeal to anatomy. The number of vertebræ composing the vertebral column\r\n(exclusive of the cephalic) seemed to me a tolerably secure guide in the\r\ndetermination of species,--being aware, however, that some doubted the\r\nmethod, believing that the number of the vertebræ might vary, first,\r\nwith the individual, secondly with the age of the specimen. I still\r\ncontinue to be of my original opinion, that the number of vertebræ\r\ncomprising the vertebral column, properly so called, may safely be\r\ntrusted in determining the species of the Cetacea; and with this view I\r\ndrew up the following Table, excepting from it the genus _Dugong_, which\r\nI have never considered to be a Cetacean:--\r\n\r\n_Tabular View of the Number of the Vertebræ in certain Cetacea._\r\n\r\n(Cephalic vertebræ excluded.)\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n|                              Authorities.                         |\r\n|                 ---------------------------------------------------\r\n|  SPECIES.       |  CUVIER.

Van Beneden.\r\nHe praises, and deservedly, no doubt, the exertions of M. Eschricht to\r\ncollect a proper Museum of the Cetacea. It appears, according to M.\r\nEschricht, that at no age whatever do we find in true whales (meaning, I\r\npresume, the _Mysticetus borealis_ and _australis_) any distinct\r\nvertebræ in the cervical region as in other mammals. A fusion of all\r\ninto one bone or cartilage seems to take place even in the youngest\r\nfoetus. In the foetus examined by me of this species (a specimen removed\r\nfrom the uterus of a true _Mysticetus_ killed in the Greenland seas), I\r\ndo not recollect the precise appearance of the cervical vertebræ; but\r\nthe skeleton is in existence, and shall be referred to. To the skeleton\r\nof the Rorqual now in the Museum at Antwerp, and which seems to me of\r\nthe same species as the one I dissected in Scotland (and of which the\r\nskeleton, prepared with infinite care by my brother and myself, was\r\npresented by me to the Town Council of Edinburgh, and is now preserved\r\nin the Zoological Gardens of the same city), he gives the following\r\nvertebræ:--\r\n\r\n  Skeleton of the Rorqual at Antwerp--Cervical  7\r\n  Dorsal                                       14-15\r\n  Lumbar                                       15\r\n  Caudal                                       25[C]\r\n                                               --------\r\n  Total                                        61 or 62\r\n\r\nIn the skeleton of the Great Rorqual now in the Zoological Gardens at\r\nEdinburgh, and originally dissected and prepared by my brother and\r\nmyself, these vertebræ are--\r\n\r\n  Cervical             7\r\n  Dorsal              15\r\n  Lumbar and Caudal   43\r\n                      --\r\n  Total               65\r\n\r\nIn that of the Lesser Rorqual I dissected in 1830, the skeleton of which\r\nI think is still preserved in the Museum of the University of Edinburgh,\r\nwe found--\r\n\r\n         Vertebræ.\r\n  Cervical       7\r\n  Dorsal        11\r\n  Lumbar        13\r\n  Caudal        17\r\n                --\r\n  Total         48\r\n\r\nThe specimen was that of a young animal, and of the same species, I\r\nbelieve, as the one described by Mr. Hunter and Fabricius; it is a\r\ndistinct species, and not merely the young of the Great Rorqual.\r\n\r\nI shall return to the Dugong, as not being a Cetacean, in a future\r\nSection: its skeleton has been examined in a masterly way by De\r\nBlainville, an anatomist and observer of the highest order, since the\r\ntime I wrote and published my Memoir on the Dugong.\r\n\r\nThe first great step in the anatomy of the Cetacea is unquestionably due\r\nto Cuvier; but his dissections were almost confined to the genus\r\n_Delphinus_, or the common Porpoise of our coasts. I repeated all his\r\ndissections, and found them, as they almost always were, scrupulously\r\nexact; but when I came to examine Cetacea with whalebone instead of\r\nteeth, I was surprised to find how different, in fact, the anatomy of\r\nthe two great families was. Scarcely in any great natural family do we\r\nfind Cuvier's favourite theory of anatomical and physiological\r\nco-relations so entirely at fault as in the Cetacea. The teeth or\r\nwhalebone, as natural-history characters, lead to no results; the whole\r\nstructure of the interior defies all _à-priori_ reasoning. The brain in\r\nwhalebone-whales does not fill the interior of the cranium; so that the\r\ncapacity of the one is no measure of the solid bulk of the other. Their\r\nfood is various, having no relation to the teeth or buccal appendages;\r\nvascular structures surround the spinal marrow, and extend in the\r\n_Balænopteræ_ into the cavity of the cranium, which seem to be without\r\nany analogy in other mammals, or, at the least, a very obscure one, and\r\nwhose functions are wholly unknown.\r\n\r\nCetacea might with some propriety be divided into whales with whalebone,\r\nand whales with teeth. Those with whalebone have rudimentary teeth in\r\nboth jaws in the foetal state. Fossil Cetacea exist, and they seem to\r\nhave been of both kinds, but, no doubt, were generically and\r\nspecifically distinct from the recent. Judging from the remains of those\r\nI have seen, I am inclined to think that those with teeth were of a\r\nstronger and firmer build in the skeleton than those called recent; that\r\nthe neck was longer, and the caudal portion of the column shorter than\r\nin the recent kinds, and that they approached the Saurians in form.\r\nThere is a remarkable want of symmetry in the crania of some of the\r\nCetacea; but most remarkable is the cranium of the Narwhal. Of this fact\r\nI have already spoken, in the article published in the Transactions of\r\nthe Royal Society of Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n_Delphinus Phocæna. Dissection of a small Cetacean sent to me from\r\nOrkney in the month of May 1835._--This species is said to abound on the\r\ncoasts, and to furnish a kind of fishery to the inhabitants. On\r\ndissection we found 81 vertebræ, exclusive of the cephalic. The species\r\nmust be quite distinct from those previously and subsequently examined\r\nby myself and many others, in which the number of vertebræ ranged from\r\n61 to 66. It is also, I think, distinct from the specimen I saw in Dr.\r\nR. Hunter's Museum in Glasgow, in which the number of vertebræ was 90,\r\nexclusive of the cephalic in all the cases. Thus it stands with regard\r\nto the Cetacea called Porpoises and Dolphins.\r\n\r\nIn certain species of _Delphinus_ the vertical column is composed of 61\r\nvertebræ, in others of 65, in others of 66, in others of 81, in others\r\nof 90.\r\n\r\nThe specimen I now describe was, no doubt, that of a young animal; and\r\nthe skeleton was prepared, consequently, as a natural one. This method\r\nhas the advantage of security against the loss of any important osseous\r\nstructures, which too frequently happens when the bones require to be\r\nmacerated. The bones contained little oil, and weighed, head included,\r\nonly 7-1/4 lbs.; the whole animal, when entire, weighed 14 stone, or 196\r\nlbs.; the skeleton therefore was about a twenty-fourth part of the whole\r\nweight. It was a female. The external nostrils terminated in a single\r\norifice of a semilunar shape, with the concavity turned towards the\r\nsnout. Measurements of young animals have not the importance of those of\r\nthe adult; but I give them here because I think that the specimen,\r\nalthough young, had nearly attained its full growth:--\r\n\r\n                                                   ft.  in.\r\n  Total length over the dorsum                      6   5-2/8\r\n  Total length lateral surface                      6  11-2/8\r\n  Total length abdominal surface                    6  11-2/8\r\n  From the snout to the nostrils                    0  11-4/8\r\n  From the nostrils to the dorsal fin               1   6-4/8\r\n  Base of the dorsal fin                            0  11\r\n  From dorsal fin to foot of tail                   3   0-2/8\r\n  Breadth of pectoral limb                          0   4-4/8\r\n  From the snout to the organs of generation        3   9-4/8\r\n  Circumference anterior to the arm                 2   9\r\n  Circumference anterior to dorsal fin              3   2-4/8\r\n  Circumference posterior to dorsal fin             2  10\r\n  Circumference at setting on of the tail           0   8-4/8\r\n  Length of pectoral limb                           0  10\r\n  Breadth of tail                                   1   2\r\n  Greatest height of the dorsal fin                 0   9\r\n\r\nFrom the notes taken at the time, I find that my brother remarks that\r\nthe Dolphin of Orkney differed a good deal in shape from those found in\r\nthe Forth and seas in the South of Scotland. There were, moreover, 16\r\nmore vertebræ than in the skeleton of the Common Porpoise of authors.\r\nThe teeth generally weighed 2-1/2 grains each.\r\n\r\nFurther, the muscles of the tongue, intrinsic as well as extrinsic, were\r\nextremely well developed. The isthmus faucium was 3 inches long. All\r\nthis part was extremely glandular. A well-marked muscular gullet\r\nfollowed, composed of two layers of muscular fibres,--one circular\r\ninternally, and one longitudinal externally. These latter sent a slip to\r\nthe base of the arytænoid cartilages. The mucous membrane of the gullet\r\nhad no true epidermic covering, and in this respect differed remarkably\r\nfrom the first gastric compartment, from which a cuticular lining could\r\nbe peeled off, as strong as that from the sole of the foot in man. The\r\nlarynx presented that organization so well described by the illustrious\r\nCuvier, and which I believe to be peculiar to the whales with teeth. It\r\ndiffers very much, as I explained long ago, in its arrangement from that\r\nof Whalebone Whales,--a fact of which I think Cuvier was not aware. The\r\ncricoid cartilage was imperfect in form; the hyo-epiglottic muscles very\r\nstrong. The proper arytænoid were present, and strong, but did not\r\nextend so high as in man; the thyro-arytænoid muscles were very fully\r\ndeveloped. In the interior of the larynx there were no projections nor\r\nventricles, no cuneiform cartilages, nor cornicula laryngis. The rings\r\nof the trachea formed complete circles.\r\n\r\n_Stomach._--The cuticular lining is limited to the first cavity or\r\ncompartment. It is in the second compartment that is found the curious\r\nglandular arrangement first, I believe, described by me in the\r\n'Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.' This structure is most\r\nprobably not limited to the second compartment. There are four distinct\r\ncompartments in the stomach of this animal. A dilated duodenum follows,\r\n6 inches in length. It is possible that this may have been in some\r\ninstances mistaken for a stomach. The valvulæ conniventes commence with\r\nthe jejunum; these are longitudinal, and extend to within about 6 inches\r\nof the anus, terminating at a point where the intestine seems enlarged.\r\nThe length of the intestines, large and small, was 90 feet;\r\ncircumference generally about 2 inches. Thousands and tens of thousands\r\nof parasitical worms were found in the stomach, but none in the\r\nintestine. In the stomach also we found four mandibles of the\r\ncuttlefish, but no remains of anything in the intestines, and no\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\n_Heart and Vessels._--The heart weighed exactly one pound. The\r\nEustachian valve was small, that of Thebesius imperfect. The aorta\r\nproceeded for about 3 inches of its course before giving off any\r\nbranches. At a point corresponding to the 15th or 16th lumbar vertebra\r\nthe vessel divided into the common iliacs. The _art. sacri media_, its\r\ncontinuation, continued its course protected by the V-bones, and giving\r\noff branches corresponding to the intervertebral spaces.\r\n\r\n_Brain and Nervous System._--The erectile tissue surrounding the spinal\r\ncord and origin of the spinal nerves in the Cetacea did not extend into\r\nthe interior of the cranium. The entire encephalic mass weighed 2-1/2\r\nlbs.: cerebrum, 2 lbs.; cerebellum, 1/4; pons and medulla, 1/4 = 2-1/2.\r\nCompared with a drawing of Camper of the _Delphinus Phocæna_, the brain\r\nwas found to differ remarkably, in being much broader in the line of the\r\nmiddle and posterior lobes. In no animal did I ever find the fibrous\r\nstructure of the brain so well marked; and this extended to the\r\ncerebellum[D]. I give here some measurements of the brain, which may be\r\nof use to future observers. The brain is short from before backwards,\r\nbut broad transversely:--\r\n\r\n  Antero-posterior diameter                 5-2/8  inches.\r\n  Breadth                                   8      inches.\r\n  Greatest breadth of the cerebellum        4      inches.\r\n  Length of the cerebellar hemisphere       4-6/8  inches.\r\n  Depth of ditto                            3-2/8  inches.\r\n  Weight of the encephalic mass             2-1/2  lbs.\r\n  Depth of the interhemispherical fissure   1-2/8  inches.\r\n  Length of the corpus callosum             1-7/8  inches.\r\n  Weight of cerebrum                        2    }\r\n  Weight of cerebellum                      0-1/4}  = 2-1/2 lbs.\r\n  Weight of the pons and med. oblongata     0-1/4}\r\n\r\n_Nerves._--The 7th pair was found to be unexpectedly large and firm,\r\nincluding both portions. The anterior roots of the spinal nerves were\r\nfar more numerous than the posterior or dorsal.\r\n\r\n_Muscles._--The panniculus carnosus, strong and fleshy, extended nearly\r\nover the whole trunk. The recti abdominis were powerful, and attached\r\ninferiorly in this way:--A portion runs to the pelvic bones; a much\r\nstronger to a strong aponeurosis, situated between the anus and the root\r\nof the tail.\r\n\r\nThe erector muscles of the spine (sacrolumbalis, longissimus dorsi and\r\nmultifidus spinæ) weighed fully 16 lbs. They had but slender costal\r\nattachments; but their spinal (small delicate tendons) were innumerable.\r\nThe scaleni were very large; and the vessels held the same relation to\r\nthem as in man. The serratus magnus was comparatively small. The larger\r\nrhomboid had no spinal attachment; the minor rhomboid seemed to be the\r\nlarger of the two. The pectorals were comparatively small. The adipose\r\ntissue appeared to be wholly confined to the subcutaneous region. The\r\nmuscles were of a deep brown colour, full of blood, with a short, dark,\r\nand well-flavoured fibre: when cooked, they had a strong resemblance in\r\nflavour and taste to the flesh of the hare.\r\n\r\n\r\nPart II. THE BALÆNA WHALES, OR WHALES WITH WHALEBONE.\r\n\r\nIn February 1834 a young whale of the family of Balæna Whales was caught\r\nnear the Queensferry, in the Firth of Forth. One much larger had been\r\nseen some time before, but escaped. I purchased it for dissection,\r\nalthough I was aware that it was impossible for me, during the hurry of\r\nthe winter session, to devote much time to it. But I had able assistants\r\n(Mr. Henry Goodsir, Mr. Edward Forbes, and my brother), from whom I\r\nexpected a good deal of aid. Some very beautiful drawings of this whale,\r\nmade for me by Mr. Edward Forbes and by my brother, are still in my\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to see, by the dorsal fin and by the numerous plaits or\r\nfolds on the abdominal surface of the throat and chest, before any\r\ndissection, that the specimen was a young Balænopterous whale, differing\r\nin a great many points from the true whale or _Mysticetus_: for, 1st,\r\nthe form of the head was entirely different; 2nd, it had a dorsal fin;\r\nand, 3rd, occupying the lower surface of the throat and thorax were\r\nnumerous folds of the integuments. To this class of whales I have been\r\nin the habit of giving the name of Rorqual, to distinguish them from the\r\nother class of Whalebone Whales, the _Mysticetus_ both _borealis_ and\r\n_australis_.\r\n\r\nIt appears from my notes, that at that time M. G. Cuvier considered the\r\nspecies I now describe as identical with the Great Rorqual I had\r\ndescribed about two years previously; but I felt convinced then, as now,\r\nthat they form distinct species, and in this opinion some continental\r\nanatomists seem to coincide.\r\n\r\nBeing persuaded that there was some inaccuracy in former drawings of the\r\nspecies, I had the specimen suspended and drawn with great care by Mr.\r\nEdward Forbes. This position explained the mechanism of the mouth,\r\nshowing its great size, even in the short Balæna Whales; its great\r\ncapacity in the _Mysticetus_ had never been doubted.\r\n\r\nAs to the species, the conclusion I arrived at was, that the specimen\r\nbelonged to that termed by Fabricius _rostrata_, and that individuals of\r\nthe species had been seen by John Hunter, Sir James Watson, and\r\nFabricius.\r\n\r\n  _Measurements._                                       ft.  in.\r\n\r\n  Total length of the specimen                                9  11\r\n  Circumference immediately behind the pectoral extremities   5   2\r\n  Circumference where the folds or rugæ terminated            4   8-1/4\r\n  Ditto of the tail at its origin                             1   5-1/2\r\n  Length from the back fin to the setting on of the tail      2  10\r\n  Length from the snout to the ear                            3   0\r\n  Length from snout to nostrils                               1   4\r\n  Length of lower jaw                                         2   3\r\n  Length of arm; inner side                                   1   3\r\n  Length from the angle of the mouth to the arm               1   3\r\n  Length from snout to arm                                    2   9\r\n  Length of tail in depth                                     0  11\r\n  Length of back fin at the base                              0   8\r\n  Height of back fin                                          0   8-1/2\r\n  From top to tip of tail                                     2   8-1/2\r\n  Stomach:--1st compartment, in length                        1   2\r\n            2nd compartment, in length                        1   4\r\n            3rd compartment, in length                        0   8\r\n            4th compartment, in length                        0   7\r\n            5th compartment, in length                        0   3\r\n  Spleen weighed 4 ounces; its length  was                    0   5\r\n  Liver, 9 lbs.\r\n  Small intestines, length                                   20   0\r\n  Large intestines, length                                    2   4\r\n  Kidney, weight 2-1/4 lbs.\r\n  Brain (including 2 inches of spinal marrow), 3-1/2 lbs.\r\n  Cerebellum, pons, and 2 inches of spinal marrow, 3/4 lb.\r\n  Great hemisphere of the brain measured 3 inches in\r\n    length, in breadth, 6-1/2; at the base, 8 inches.\r\n  Tuber annulare                                              0   1-2/8\r\n  Olfactory nerves, in length                                 0   1-1/2\r\n  Ditto, breadth                                              0   2-1/2\r\n  Skeleton:--Length of cranium                                2  11\r\n             Greatest breadth between the orbits              1   3\r\n             Length of vertebral column                       7   8\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the skeleton of this Rorqual with the Gigantic Rorqual I\r\nalso dissected, we find as follows:--\r\n\r\n                       _R. giganteus._   _R. minor._\r\n\r\n  Cervical         vertebræ  7          vertebræ  7\r\n  Dorsal                    15                   11\r\n  Lumbar, sacral, caudal    43                   30\r\n                            --                   --\r\n                            65                   48\r\n\r\nThese differences must be specific.\r\n\r\nAt the extremity of the snout in either jaw there were 8 strong\r\nbristles, being the only vestiges of hair found on the external surface.\r\nThe mouth was of great size; the tongue large and tolerably free, and of\r\na pale rose or vermilion colour. The baleen, where deepest, measured\r\nabout 4 inches; there were 370 plates on each side; but anteriorly and\r\nposteriorly these plates were reduced to mere bristles.\r\n\r\nThe isthmus faucium allowed the closed hand to pass through it; through\r\nthis isthmus I do not believe that any water ever passes into the\r\npharynx, unless it be accidentally, as in man. The \"spout\" of the\r\nWhalebone Whale is composed, no doubt, of the pulmonary vapour, and not\r\nof any water received into the pharynx from the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe stomach seemed composed of five compartments externally, but\r\npresented only four when laid open, the fifth being manifestly the\r\nduodenum. In the intestines no remains of food were found, but abundance\r\nof intestinal worms, and a substance strongly resembling the human\r\nmeconium. There was an ilio-cæcal valve as distinct as in man. In the\r\nrectum the folds of the mucous membrane were transverse.\r\n\r\n_Organs of Respiration_.--The external nostrils were double; and the\r\ncavities of the nostrils provided with the remarkable cartilages and\r\nmuscular apparatus I discovered and described in the anatomy of the\r\nGreat Rorqual. In this specimen they were about 4 inches in length, but\r\nof as many feet in the large Rorqual. The mode of breathing in the\r\nRorquals does not differ much from that in man, with the exception of\r\nthe apparatus of the protruding cartilages, which in man are\r\nrudimentary.\r\n\r\nThe _Olfactory Nerves_ were quite as large as in other mammals; and in\r\nthis respect the Balæna Whales are quite unlike the Dolphins[E].\r\n\r\nThe trachea communicated, near its upper part, with a sac or pouch; the\r\nlungs were each composed of a single lobe. The rings of the trachea were\r\nmostly deficient anteriorly. In the heart the foetal arrangements had\r\nwholly disappeared. The dura mater seemed divisible into three layers,\r\nthe external being vascular. A remarkable vascular substance connected\r\nwith this layer covers the back part of the brain and cerebellum,\r\nextending into the spinal canal, and even into the chest. At the base of\r\nthe brain the vascular plexus was about 2 inches in thickness. It is, as\r\nis well known, a sort of erectile tissue, of whose functions we are\r\nwholly ignorant. It is not confined to this course, but extends to the\r\nneck, and, passing through the foramina intervertebralia, fills the\r\nintercostal spaces exterior to the pleura.\r\n\r\nThere was evidently a canal in the centre of the spinal marrow. Wherever\r\nthe nerves of the lungs and stomach were traced, they terminated in\r\nloops. We did not observe in the Great Rorqual any tracheal pouch like\r\nthat in the smaller; but it may have escaped notice: if absent in the\r\nGreat Rorqual, it would be another proof of the distinctness of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe doubts raised by M. St. Hilaire, as to the Whale being a mammal in\r\nthe true sense of the term, were set aside long ago by an appeal to\r\nfacts. The young of the Whale tribe suckle like the young of all\r\nmammals; nevertheless I showed, in 1834, that the lactiferous glands in\r\nthe _Balænopteræ_ differ in structure from the same organs in most\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nI do not find in my notes anything to add to the description of the\r\nGreat Rorqual already published in the 'Transactions of the Royal\r\nSociety of Edinburgh' for 1827, to which I beg leave to refer the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nA single remark must be added regarding the nature of the vascular\r\nplexus which, in the Cetacea, surrounds the spinal marrow, and extends\r\ninto the chest. On selecting the artery which seemed to form the plexus,\r\nwhich was, if I rightly recollect, in this instance an intercostal\r\nartery, and dissecting it under water, I found, to my surprise, that the\r\nartery, so long as I followed it, never gave off any branches, but\r\ncontinued of the same calibre throughout, making innumerable\r\nflexuosities or turnings. Thus, on a plexiform mass of this kind being\r\ncut across, the first impression is, that a great number of arterial\r\nbranches or arteries have been divided, whilst in fact the entire plexus\r\nseems to be formed of one artery.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected of animals so much withdrawn from human\r\nobservation, there is but little to say on the natural history of the\r\nCetacea properly so called. Their food, no doubt, is various, and seems\r\nto have little or no relation to the character of their dentition. The\r\nenormous Cachalot, with its vast teeth implanted only in one jaw, is\r\ngenerally understood to prey chiefly on the Cuttlefish. The food of the\r\ntrue Whale, or _Mysticetus_, is well known to be the Clio and other\r\nsmaller Mollusca, with which certain regions of the ocean abound; the\r\nsame, or similar, is probably the food of the more active and restless\r\nRorquals, found in both hemispheres. The Dolphins, or Toothed Whales,\r\ngenerally prey, no doubt, on fishes of various kinds; yet, even as\r\nregards these, it has been proved by my esteemed friend, the late Mr.\r\nHenry Goodsir, that some of the largest, following in the wake of the\r\nherring shoals, prey not on these, but on the various microscopic food\r\n(the Entomostraca and other marine animals) which I was the first to\r\nprove to be the natural food of many excellent gregarious freshwater\r\nfish, as the Vendace, Early Loch Leven Trout, the Brown Trout of the\r\nHighland and Scottish lakes generally, and of the Herring itself[F]. It\r\nis scarcely necessary to add, that the complex apparatus connected with\r\nthe exterior nostrils of the Dolphins is wholly wanting in the Balæna\r\nWhales,--a fact of which M. Cuvier was not aware when he wrote his\r\ncelebrated Treatise on Comparative Anatomy.\r\n\r\n_Appendix_.--Since writing the above, I have received an answer to a\r\nletter I addressed to my friend, John Goodsir, Esq., Professor of\r\nAnatomy in the University of Edinburgh. The request contained in my\r\nletter to Mr. Goodsir was, to examine for me the skeleton of a foetal\r\n_Mysticetus_ now in the University Museum. The foetus from which this\r\nskeleton was prepared was removed from the uterus of the mother, killed\r\nin the North Seas by the seamen of a whaling ship, by one of my former\r\nstudents, Mr. R. Auld, who presented the specimen to me. The point at\r\nissue was the composition of the cervical vertebræ in the true or\r\nGreenland Whale, the _Balæna Mysticetus_. M. Van Beneden, to whose\r\nmemoir I have referred in the commencement of this, says, on the\r\nauthority of Eschricht, that at no age whatever do we find in true\r\nWhales (meaning, I presume, the _Mysticetus borealis_ and _australis_)\r\nany distinct vertebræ in the cervical region, as in other mammals. A\r\nfusion of all into one bone or cartilage seems to take place even in the\r\nyoungest foetus. Now, I had enjoyed the rare opportunity of dissecting\r\nthe foetus of the _Mysticetus_, and I knew that the skeleton, prepared\r\nwith the greatest care, was still preserved in the Museum of the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh. I wrote to Mr. Goodsir to re-examine this point\r\nfor me, for I did not find in my notes any confirmation of the\r\nobservations of Eschricht. Mr. Goodsir's reply to my note is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n                                             \"University, Edinburgh,\r\n                                                 Sept. 30, 1857.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\n\"In the skeleton of the foetal _Mysticetus_ now in the University\r\nMuseum, the bodies of the axis and atlas have shrivelled up together,\r\nhaving evidently consisted of cartilage only; but the bodies of the five\r\nposterior cervical vertebræ are beautifully distinct, having well-formed\r\nosseous centres, which give them more of the configuration of the\r\nsucceeding vertebral bodies than they present in their compressed form\r\nin the adult.\r\n\r\n\"The neural arches in the cervical region of this skeleton are five in\r\nnumber; the two anterior, which are distinctly those of the atlas and\r\naxis, have an osseous nodule on each side, where the transverse\r\nprocesses pass off. The third arch belongs to the third vertebra, the\r\nfourth and fifth to the sixth and seventh. These three arches are\r\ncartilaginous, and present no osseous centres. It is impossible to\r\ndetermine from the preparation whether the arches of the fourth and\r\nfifth vertebræ had been cut away in dissecting the parts, or whether\r\nthey have shrivelled up in drying; but as the skeleton was very\r\ncarefully prepared, and as these two arches are deficient (at least\r\nlaterally) in the adult _Mysticetus_, I presume that the cartilaginous\r\nmatrices were at least extremely delicate in the foetus.\r\n\r\n\"I believe I have stated all the facts, afforded by this skeleton, which\r\nbear upon your questions. They appear to me to afford no support to the\r\nviews to which they refer.\r\n\r\n                                            \"Yours very sincerely,\r\n                                          (Signed)        \"JOHN GOODSIR.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusion I arrived at is this,--that the actual number of cervical\r\nvertebræ in the _Mysticetus_ is, as in most other mammals, seven, and\r\nthat, notwithstanding their earlier fusion, they are originally quite\r\ndistinct.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[C] It is stated that some of the last of these are of wood.

I am collecting skulls of all the domesticated\r\nanimals, and skeletons of the sheep and goats. I have got a few fish,\r\nincluding a prettily-marked _Diodon_ or _Tetraodon_, probably new, and a\r\n_Myletes_ which I did not meet with formerly. The _Siluridæ_ are the\r\nmost abundant fishes; and one species closely resembles the\r\n_Hypophthalmus_, figured by Rüppell in his 'Fishes of the Nile and Red\r\nSea.' I have not met with another Polypterus. I shall get a\r\n_Lepidosiren_ in the river, and have heard of an electrical fish, I\r\nbelieve a _Malopteruris_, such as I formerly found. I enclose two scales\r\nof a fish which is said to grow to the length of 5 feet, but of which I\r\nhave specimens half that size only,--also a sketch of a curious fish\r\n2-1/2 feet, which I put into spirits; it has neither ventral nor anal\r\nfins, a very peculiar caudal, and a slender head, while the dorsal\r\nextends along the whole back; eyes very small; teeth numerous and hard,\r\nbut not sharp.\" He adds, in a postscript, that he had got the\r\n_Lepidosiren_. He had collected 700 species of plants, and numerous\r\nfine fruits, which he says \"will rejoice Sir William Hooker's heart.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Baikie's postscript, however, mentions that his vessel had been\r\nwrecked about twelve miles above Lagos, and that she sunk in a few\r\nminutes after she struck. He does not say what was the fate of his\r\ncollections, but states that all the party had fever from fatigue and\r\nsleeping in swamps after the wreck.--J.

In\r\nthe Aru, Key, and neighbouring islands, we meet with the extreme range\r\nof the Australian insect-fauna; and as might be expected, it is found\r\namongst the Vespidious Group, and in one or two instances in the\r\nFormicidæ. The latter, being frequently conveyed from one island to\r\nanother, can perhaps scarcely be considered indicative of natural\r\ngeographical distribution. Of the forty-six species of the Formicidous\r\nGroup, only six were previously known to science. Of the genus\r\n_Podomyrma_ here established, one species only, from Adelaide, was\r\npreviously known; it is one of the most distinct and remarkable genera\r\nin the family. The _Pompilidæ_ are species of great beauty, some closely\r\nresembling those of Australia in the banding and maculation of their\r\nwings; amongst the _Vespidæ_ will be found some of the most elegant and\r\nbeautiful forms in the whole of that protean family of Hymenoptera.\r\n\r\n\r\nFam.

By DANIEL HANBURY, Esq., F.L.S.\r\n\r\n[Read December 16th, 1858.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the month of June last, my friend Professor Guibourt, of Paris, laid\r\nbefore the Académie des Sciences[G] some account of a remarkable\r\nsubstance called _Tréhala_, the cocoon of a Curculionidous insect found\r\nin Persia, where, as well as in other parts of the East, it enjoys some\r\ncelebrity as the basis of a mucilaginous drink administered to the sick.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this substance, as well as of another insect-product of\r\nPersia, together with the insects themselves, were presented a few years\r\nago to the British Museum by W. K. Loftus, Esq., who obtained them while\r\nengaged by the British Government on the question of the Turco-Persian\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nThe precise determination of the species of these insects being a matter\r\nof doubt, they have at my request been lately examined by M. Jekel, of\r\nParis, an entomologist with whom the family of _Curculionidæ_ has long\r\nbeen an especial study. One of these insects M. Jekel has identified\r\nwith a species of wide distribution; the other proving undescribed, he\r\nhas drawn up a description of it, which, accompanied by a figure, I have\r\nthe honour to lay before the Linnean Society. To this, I venture to add\r\na few observations upon the productions to which I have alluded.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is _Tréhala_ or _Tricala_, under which name it formed\r\npart of the Collection of Materia Medica sent by M. Della Sudda, of\r\nConstantinople, to the Paris Exhibition of 1855, and since deposited in\r\nthe Ecole de Pharmacie in Paris.\r\n\r\n_Tréhala_ (fig. 2) consists of cocoons of an ovoid or globular form,\r\nabout 3/4 of an inch in length; their inner surface is composed of a\r\nsmooth, hard, dusky layer, external to which is a thick, rough,\r\ntuberculated coating of a greyish-white colour and earthy appearance.\r\nSome of the cocoons have attached to them the remains of the tomentose\r\nstalk of the plant upon which they were formed; others have portions of\r\na tomentose spiny leaf built into them; and, more rarely, one finds\r\nportions of the flowering heads of the plant, a species of _Echinops_,\r\nsimilarly enclosed. Many of the cocoons are open at one end and empty;\r\nothers have a longitudinal aperture, originally closed by the stalk of\r\nthe plant, and still contain the insect; a few are entirely closed.\r\nSpecimens of this insect, extracted from the cocoons sent to Paris, were\r\nexamined in 1856 by my friend Mr. W. Wilson Saunders, who pronounced\r\nthem to be _Larinus maculatus_ of Faldermann,--a determination also\r\narrived at by M. Jekel from specimens presented by Mr. Loftus to the\r\nBritish Museum. Respecting these latter, one of which is represented in\r\nfig. 1, M. Jekel makes the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n    \"LARINUS MACULATUS, _Faldermann, Faun. Transcauc._ ii. p. 228, 449,\r\n    tab. 6. f. 10, et iii. p. 198.--_Schönh. Gen. et Sp. Curcul._ iii.\r\n    p. 112 et vii. 2. p. 7.--_Hochhuth, Bull. Moscou_, 1847, No. 2. p.\r\n    538 (var. [Greek: gamma]).\r\n\r\n    \"Var. [Greek: gamma]. _Larin. Onopordinis_, Sch. _loc. cit._ iii. p.\r\n    111 (excl. synon.).\r\n\r\n    \"Of this species, Mr. Loftus captured several specimens, all of\r\n    small size: from some of them the pollinosity had been rubbed off,\r\n    as is represented in the figure by Mr. Ford (_vide_ fig. 1), which\r\n    shows only a part of the inferior layer of tomentum and the greyish\r\n    ground of the dorsal and lateral maculæ; the latter, being the most\r\n    densely coloured in fresh specimens, are always the most persistent.\r\n    These belong to Schönherr's var. [Greek: gamma], which that author\r\n    formerly regarded as the _Larinus Onopordinis_, Fabr. Others of Mr.\r\n    Loftus's specimens, which are very fresh, belong to var. [Greek:\r\n    beta]; none to the typical variety, which is often larger in size.\r\n\r\n    \"This species has a very extended habitat: I have received it from\r\n    European Turkey (Frivaldski), Beyrouth, Caucasus, Persia (Dupont),\r\n    &c. &c.; and it is recorded by Schönherr as also found in Barbary\r\n    and Portugal.\r\n\r\n    \"This is the insect which proceeds from the rough chalky-looking\r\n    nidus figured by Mr. Ford. (_Vide_ fig. 2.)\"\r\n\r\nThe entomological question being so far disposed of, I may be permitted\r\na few remarks upon the properties which have obtained for _Tréhala_ a\r\nplace among drugs and dietetic substances.\r\n\r\nThe first author who gives any account of the substance is Father Ange,\r\nwho, in his 'Pharmacopoea Persica[H],' describes it in the following\r\nterms:--\"Est autem istud medicamentum veluti _tragea_ ex nucleo pistacii\r\nintegro confecta; nam revera saccharum istud exterius corrugatum et\r\nagglomeratum adhæret cuidam nucleo, in quo non fructus, sed vermiculus\r\nquidam nigricans Persice _C-hezoukek_ bombycis instar reconditur et\r\nmoritur.\"\r\n\r\nFather Ange also states that the substance is called in Persian _Schakar\r\ntigal_ ([Persian script]), literally _Sugar of nests_; but his Arabic\r\nnames, _Schakar el ma-ascher_ ([Arabic script]) and _Saccar el aschaar_,\r\napply to an entirely different substance, namely to a saccharine matter\r\nexuded, after the punctures of an insect, from the stems of _Calotropis\r\nprocera_, R. Br.[I], of which plant he gives a quaint but tolerably\r\ncharacteristic description.\r\n\r\nMr. Loftus, who obtained the specimens which he presented to the British\r\nMuseum, at Kirrind in Persia, in September, 1851, gives as the Persian\r\nname of the cocoons _Shek roukeh_--a term, probably, the same as the\r\n\"_C-hezoukek_\" (a misprint?) of Father Ange, but the signification of\r\nwhich I have not been able to discover.\r\n\r\nAnother notice of the same substance, with a figure, is briefly given in\r\nDr. Honigberger's 'Thirty-five Years in the East' (Lond. 1852, vol. ii.\r\npp. 305-6), where we read that _Manna teeghul_ or _Shukure teeghal_,\r\nwhich are certain insect-nests of a hard texture, rough on the outside,\r\nsmooth within, about half an inch in length, and of a whitish colour,\r\nare imported into Lahore from Hindostan.\r\n\r\nM. Bourlier published in 1857 an interesting note on the same\r\nsubstance[J], which has been followed by M. Guibourt's communication to\r\nthe Académie des Sciences, and still later by a memoir on the chemical\r\nhistory of Tréhala, by M. Marcellin Berthelot, also presented to the\r\nAcademy[K].\r\n\r\nFrom the investigations of M. Guibourt, it appears that the cocoons are\r\ncomposed of a large proportion of starch (identical with that found in\r\nthe stem of the _Echinops_, upon which the insect forms its nest), of\r\ngum, a peculiar saccharine matter, a bitter principle, besides earthy\r\nand alkaline salts.\r\n\r\nThe saccharine principle, which has been especially examined by M.\r\nBerthelot, and named by him _Tréhalose_, is a body analogous to\r\ncane-sugar, but possessing distinctive properties, which separate it\r\nfrom that and all other varieties of sugar.\r\n\r\nM. Bourlier states that _Tréhala_, which is abundant in the shops of the\r\nJew drug-dealers of Constantinople, is frequently used by the Arab and\r\nTurkish physicians in the form of a decoction, which is regarded by them\r\nas of peculiar efficacy in diseases of the respiratory organs.\r\n\r\nThe second insect-product to which I would draw attention, is a\r\nsaccharine substance resembling dark honey. Mr. Loftus, who obtained it\r\nnear Kirrind, 13th July, 1851, and whose specimen is in the British\r\nMuseum, states that it is exuded from a species of thistle when pierced\r\nby a Rhynchophorous insect; but he fails to inform us for what purposes\r\nit is used by the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMr. Loftus having also presented the Museum with excellent specimens\r\nboth of the plant and insect, I am able to state that the former is\r\n_Echinops persicus_, Fisch., and the latter a new species of _Larinus_,\r\nto which M. Jekel has applied the name _Larinus mellificus_, and of\r\nwhich he has drawn up the following description:--\r\n\r\n    \"LARINUS MELLIFICUS, _Jekel_ (fig. 3). Breviter ovatus, convexus,\r\n    niger, nitidus; infra subtiliter, lateribus thoracis margineque\r\n    elytrorum intus medio versus angulariter ampliata, apicem occupante\r\n    griseo-cinerascenti tomentosis; rostro leviter punctato, basi\r\n    utrinque bicanaliculato cum elevatione media lata subcariniformi;\r\n    thorace subconico antice tubulato, supra confertim sat rude\r\n    punctato, lateribus subrugoso; elytris striato-punctatis,\r\n    interstitiis latis, planis, transversim subtilissime rugulosis, cum\r\n    abdomine tenuissime alutaceis, punctis majoribus remotioribus\r\n    impressis; pectore, lateribus, pedibusque rugoso-punctatis,\r\n    femoribus infra fortiter oblique costato-rugosis; tibiis intus,\r\n    anticis fortius crenulatis.

Onopordinis_, but proportionably more elongate and\r\nless convex; rostrum and thorax longer; pilosity of the body underneath\r\nmuch thinner and shorter; thighs thicker, more clavate, the anterior\r\nevidently costate-rugose underneath; without whitish marks on the\r\nelytra, and without that layer of light-brown earth-like pollinose\r\ntransudation which is often wanting in rubbed specimens of _Larinus\r\nOnopordinis_. The freshest specimens have the griseous margin of the\r\nelytra, which parts from the base under the shoulder, obliquely and\r\nangularly ampliate interiorly towards the middle, where it reaches the\r\nsecond stria. This griseous pilosity fills all the tips of the elytra,\r\nleaving bare only the sutures, an angular notch behind the middle (which\r\nforms with that apical part of the suture a kind of hook on each\r\nelytron), and two round spots, one submarginal fronting the tip of the\r\nnotch, the other larger, discoidal, behind the foot of the notch, much\r\nabove the tip.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[G] Comptes Rendus, 21 Juin, 1858, p. 1213.\r\n\r\n[H] Pharmacopoea Persica ex idiomate Persico in Latinum conversa.
