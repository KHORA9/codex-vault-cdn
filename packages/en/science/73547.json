P. Lovecraft's superb weird\r\nfantasies.\r\n\r\nDiscovered after years of difficult search--and pieced together with\r\nas much careful patience as Charles Ward puts into his terrifying\r\nresearches in the story--August Derleth and Donald Wandrei at long last\r\nhad all the scattered pages of Lovecraft's novel complete.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript, gathered over the course of many years from attics,\r\nforgotten strong boxes and old bureaus, is published now--in WEIRD\r\nTALES.\r\n\r\nIn it you are going to read again of Cthulhu and the fearful\r\nNecronomicon; in these pages you will also find a perfect wealth of new\r\nthrills.

A Result and a Prologue_\r\n\r\nFrom a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island,\r\nthere recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore\r\nthe name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most\r\nreluctantly by his grieving father.\r\n\r\nThe patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant;\r\nhis face had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged usually\r\nacquire. While his organic processes showed a certain queerness\r\nof proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel.\r\nRespiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry, the voice\r\nwas lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible, digestion\r\nwas incredibly prolonged and minimized. The skin had a morbid chill and\r\ndryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly\r\ncoarse and loosely-knit. Even a large olive birthmark on his right hip\r\nhad disappeared, whilst there had formed on his chest a very peculiar\r\nmole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before.\r\n\r\nPsychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no\r\naffinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive\r\nof treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have\r\nmade him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and\r\ngrotesque forms.\r\n\r\nOnly Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and watched\r\nhis growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the\r\nthought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had\r\nmade a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his skeptical\r\ncolleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own\r\nin his connection with the case. He was the last to see the patient\r\nbefore his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state\r\nof mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Ward's escape\r\nbecame known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the\r\nunsolved wonders of Dr. Waite's hospital. A window open above a sheer\r\ndrop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with\r\nWillett the youth was undeniably gone.\r\n\r\nHe had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the\r\nattendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was\r\nnot there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April\r\nbreeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-gray dust that almost choked\r\nthem. True, the dogs had howled some time before; but that was while\r\nWillett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shown\r\nno disturbance later on. Ward's father was told at once over the\r\ntelephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr.\r\nWaite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both\r\ndisavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain\r\nclosely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any\r\nclues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general\r\ncredence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no\r\ntrace of the missing madman has been unearthed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCharles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his\r\ntaste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the\r\npast which filled every corner of his parent's old mansion in Prospect\r\nStreet on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient\r\nthings increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of Colonial\r\narchitecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything\r\nelse from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to\r\nremember in considering his madness. One would have fancied the patient\r\nliterally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of\r\nauto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested\r\nin the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard\r\nfor them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were\r\nobviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world\r\nwhich had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. His\r\nwhole program of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic\r\nwish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary\r\npractical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to\r\nhave been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the\r\nschools of our own time. Alienists are of the dominant opinion that the\r\nescaped patient is \"lying low\" in some humble and unexacting position\r\ntill his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of Ward's madness is a matter of dispute among alienists.\r\nDr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920,\r\nduring the boy's last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly\r\nturned from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and\r\nrefused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual\r\nresearches of much greater importance to make.\r\n\r\nIt is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw\r\na great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly dropped his general\r\nantiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult\r\nsubjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely\r\npersistent search for his fore-father's grave.\r\n\r\nFrom this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents, basing\r\nhis verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and\r\non certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made\r\ntoward the last.\r\n\r\nThose investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so\r\nthat his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when\r\nhe tries to write of them.\r\n\r\nThe true madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the\r\nCurwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip\r\nto strange foreign places had been made, and some terrible invocations\r\nchanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain _answers_\r\nto these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter\r\npenned under agonizing and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of\r\nvampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patient's\r\nmemory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed\r\nand his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many\r\nsubsequently noticed.\r\n\r\nIt was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness,\r\nthat the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward, and\r\nthe doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to\r\nsustain the youth's claim regarding his crucial discovery. There were\r\nthe mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and\r\nthe problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought\r\nto light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible message\r\nin mediaeval minuscules found in Willett's pocket when he gained\r\nconsciousness after his shocking experience.\r\n\r\nAnd most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous _results_ which\r\nthe doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final\r\ninvestigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the\r\npapers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those\r\npapers were borne for ever from human knowledge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne must look back at Charles Ward's earlier life as at something\r\nbelonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly.\r\n\r\nHis home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous\r\nhill that rises just east of the river, and from the rear windows of\r\nits rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered\r\nspires, domes, roofs and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the\r\npurple hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the\r\nlovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick façade his nurse had\r\nfirst wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white farmhouse of\r\ntwo hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on\r\ntoward the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose\r\nold square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow,\r\nheavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their\r\ngenerous yards and gardens.\r\n\r\nHe had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower\r\ndown on the steep hill, and with all its eastern houses on high\r\nterraces. The small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for\r\nit was up this hill that the growing town had climbed. One of the\r\nchild's first memories is of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and\r\ndomes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon\r\nfrom that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic against a\r\nfevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious\r\ngreens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive\r\nsilhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one\r\nof the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.\r\n\r\nWhen he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently\r\ndragged nurse and then alone in dreamy meditation. One may picture him\r\nyet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes\r\nand a slight stoop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant\r\nimpression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness.\r\n\r\nHe would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in the\r\ncrumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops\r\nto the lower eminence of Stampers Hill with its ghetto and Negro\r\nquarter clustering round the place where the Boston stagecoach used\r\nto start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious\r\nsoutherly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets,\r\nwhere the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled\r\ngarden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger.\r\n\r\nDr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first\r\nchange, Charles Ward's antiquarianism was free from every trace of\r\nthe morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond\r\ntheir quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or\r\nsavage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees,\r\nthere appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical\r\ntriumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal\r\nancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had\r\ncome from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of\r\nhighly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWard's great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a\r\ncertain \"Ann Tillinghast, daughter to Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt.\r\nJames Tillinghast,\" of whose paternity the family had preserved no\r\ntrace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records\r\nin manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a\r\nlegal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of\r\nJoseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann,\r\nher maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground \"that her Husband's\r\nname was become a public Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after\r\nhis Decease; the which confirming antient common Rumour, tho' not to\r\nbe credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past\r\nDoubting.\" This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of\r\ntwo leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one\r\nby a labored revision of the page numbers.\r\n\r\nIt was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a\r\nhitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. Having discovered his\r\nown relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character, he at once\r\nproceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might\r\nfind concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded\r\nbeyond his highest expectations, for old letters, diaries and sheaves\r\nof unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere\r\nyielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought\r\nit worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from\r\na point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial\r\ncorrespondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces' Tavern. The really\r\ncrucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willett's opinion formed the\r\ndefinite source of Ward's undoing, was the matter found in August,\r\n1919, behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It\r\nwas that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end\r\nwas deeper than the pit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _2. An Antecedent and a Horror_\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what\r\nWard heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, obscurely\r\nhorrible individual. He had fled from Salem to Providence--that\r\nuniversal haven of the odd, the free, and the dissenting--at the\r\nbeginning of the great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation\r\nbecause of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical\r\nexperiments. He was a colorless-looking man of about thirty, and was\r\nsoon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter\r\nbuying a home lot just north of Gregory Dexter's at about the foot of\r\nOlney Street. His house was built on Stampers Hill west of the Town\r\nStreet, in what later became Olney Court; and in 1761 he replaced this\r\nwith a larger one, on the same site, which is still standing.\r\n\r\nNow the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem\r\nto grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in\r\nshipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped\r\nrebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders\r\nof the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the\r\nnondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five.\r\nAs the decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide\r\nnotice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy\r\nforefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear\r\nhim out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable\r\ncomings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer\r\ngleamings of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to\r\nthe townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his\r\ncontinued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that\r\nCurwen's incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do\r\nwith his condition. At length, when over fifty years had passed since\r\nthe stranger's advent, and without producing more than five years'\r\napparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper\r\nmore darkly; and to meet more than halfway that desire for isolation\r\nwhich he had always shown.\r\n\r\nPrivate letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude\r\nof other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and\r\nfinally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which\r\nhe was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious;\r\nthough no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually\r\nbe termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he\r\ngenerally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be\r\nseen riding at various odd times of the day or night. Here his only\r\nvisible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged\r\nNarragansett Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the\r\nwife of a very repulsive cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture\r\nof Negro blood. In the lean-to of this house was the laboratory where\r\nmost of the chemical experiments were conducted. Curious porters\r\nand teamers who delivered bottles, bags or boxes at the small rear\r\ndoor would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks, crucibles,\r\nalembics, and furnaces they saw in the low-shelved room; and prophesied\r\nin whispers that the close-mouthed \"chymist\"--by which they meant\r\n_alchemist_--would not be long in finding the Philosopher's Stone.\r\nThe nearest neighbors to this farm--the Fenners, a quarter of a mile\r\naway--had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they\r\ninsisted came from the Curwen place in the night. There were cries,\r\nthey said, and sustained howlings; and they did not like the large\r\nnumber of livestock which thronged the pastures. Then, too, there was\r\nsomething very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with\r\nonly high narrow slits for windows.\r\n\r\nGreat Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwen's town house in\r\nOlney Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man\r\nmust have been nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed\r\none with the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took\r\nthe peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition. Here there\r\nwas less mystery, it is true; but the hours at which lights were seen,\r\nthe secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only\r\nmanservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged\r\nFrench housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a door\r\nwithin which only four persons lived, and the _quality_ of certain\r\nvoices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable\r\ntimes, all combined with what was known of the Pawtuxet farm to give\r\nthe place a bad name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed;\r\nfor as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading\r\nlife of the town, he had naturally made acquaintances of the better\r\nsort, whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to\r\nenjoy.\r\n\r\nHis birth was known to be good, since the Curwens or Carwens of Salem\r\nneeded no introduction in New England. It developed that Joseph Curwen\r\nhad traveled much in very early life, living for a time in England and\r\nmaking at least two voyages to the Orient; and his speech, when he\r\ndeigned to use it, was that of a learned and cultivated Englishman.\r\nThere seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance,\r\nas if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved\r\namong stranger and more potent entities.\r\n\r\nIn 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English gentleman of literary and\r\nscientific leanings, came from Newport to the town which was so rapidly\r\novertaking it in standing, and built a fine country seat on the Neck in\r\nwhat is now the heart of the best residence section where he lived in\r\nconsiderable style and comfort. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the\r\nbest library in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was\r\nmore cordially received than most other callers at the house had been.\r\nCurwen suggested a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he\r\nhad never invited anyone before; and the two drove out at once in Mr.\r\nMerritt's coach.\r\n\r\nMr. Merritt maintained that the titles of the books in the special\r\nlibrary of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which\r\nCurwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a\r\nlasting loathing. This bizarre collection, besides a host of standard\r\nworks which Mr. Merritt was not too alarmed to envy, embraced nearly\r\nall the cabalists, demonologists, and magicians known to man; and was a\r\ntreasure-house of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology.\r\nHermes Trismegistus in Mesnard's edition, the _Turba Philosophorum_,\r\nGeber's _Liber Investigationis_, and Artephous' _Key of Wisdom_ all\r\nwere there; with the cabalistic _Zohar_, Peter Jammy's set of Albertus\r\nMagnus, Raymond Lully's _Ars Magna et Ultima_ in Zetzner's edition,\r\nRoger Bacon's _Thesaurus Chemicus_, Fludd's _Clavis Alchimiae_, and\r\nTrithemius' _De Lapide Philosophico_ crowding them close. Mediaeval\r\nJews and Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned\r\npale when, upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labeled as the\r\n_Qunoon-e-Islam_, he found it was in truth the forbidden _Necronomicon_\r\nof the mad Arab Abdul Al-hazred, of which he had heard such monstrous\r\nthings whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless\r\nrites at the strange little fishing village of Kingsport, in the\r\nProvince of the Massachusetts-Bay.\r\n\r\nBut the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a\r\nmere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay face downward\r\na badly worn copy of Borellus, bearing many cryptical marginalia and\r\ninterlineations in Curwen's hand.\r\n\r\nThe book was open at about its middle, and one paragraph displayed\r\nsuch thick and tremulous pen-strokes beneath the lines of mystic\r\nblack-letters that the visitor could not resist scanning it through. He\r\nrecalled it to the end of his days, writing it down from memory in his\r\ndiary and once trying to recite it to his close friend Dr. Checkley,\r\ntill he saw how greatly it disturbed that urbane rector. It read:\r\n\r\n    The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved,\r\n    that an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his owne\r\n    Studie, and raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at\r\n    his Pleasure; and by the lyke Method from the essential Saltes of\r\n    humane Dust, a Philosopher may, without any criminal Necromancy,\r\n    call up the Shape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his\r\n    Bodie has been incinerated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street,\r\nhowever, that the worst things were muttered about Joseph Curwen.\r\nSailors are superstitious folk; and all made strange furtive signs of\r\nprotection when they saw the slim, deceptively young-looking figure\r\nwith its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the Curwen warehouse\r\nin Doubloon Street or talking with captains and supercargos on the\r\nlong quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. Curwen's own clerks\r\nand captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were mongrel\r\nriff-raff from Martinique, St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It\r\nwas, in a way, the frequency with which these sailors were replaced,\r\nwhich inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which\r\nthe old man was held, and in time it became exceedingly difficult for\r\nCurwen to keep his oddly assorted hands.\r\n\r\nBy 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague\r\nhorrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing\r\nbecause they could not be named, understood, or even proved to exist.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the merchant's worldly affairs were prospering. He had a\r\nvirtual monopoly of the town's trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and\r\ncinnamon, and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the\r\nBrowns in his importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt,\r\nrigging, iron, paper and English goods of every kind. Curwen was, in\r\nfact, one of the prime exporters of the Colony.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect\r\nyet certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to\r\nemerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or\r\nanalyze, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing.\r\nSuch is the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that\r\nthere came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed\r\ntoward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors\r\nabruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme\r\ncare and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again\r\ncaught at such wanderings; whilst the rumors of uncanny sounds and\r\nmaneuvers at his Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion.\r\n\r\nBut the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight.\r\nCurwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact\r\nof his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough\r\nto warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be\r\nlikely to suffer. So about this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last\r\ndesperate expedient to regain his footing in the community. Hitherto\r\na complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous\r\nmarriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position\r\nwould make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also\r\nhad deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside\r\nthe known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half\r\nafter his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing\r\ncertain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and\r\nindignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received,\r\nhence looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he\r\nmight exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not\r\nat all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in\r\nthe way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his\r\nsurvey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest\r\nship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named\r\nDutie Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every\r\nconceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Captain Tillinghast\r\nwas completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after\r\na terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Power's Lane hill, to\r\nsanction the blasphemous alliance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been\r\nreared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted.\r\nHer arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage\r\nmust have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain\r\nit is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the\r\nCrawford packet _Enterprise_, was dutifully broken off, and that her\r\nunion with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in\r\nthe Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished\r\nassemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed\r\nby the youngest Samuel Winson. The _Gazette_ mentioned the event very\r\nbriefly, and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be\r\ncut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much search in\r\nthe archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement\r\nthe meaningless urbanity of the language:\r\n\r\n    Monday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant,\r\n    was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Captain Dutie\r\n    Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful\r\n    Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\r\n\r\nThe social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be\r\ndenied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by\r\npersons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his\r\nthreshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was\r\nsocially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the\r\nwall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of\r\nhis wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community\r\nby displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house\r\nin Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations,\r\nand although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his\r\nwife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any\r\nother time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained\r\nin open enmity with him, this being the youthful ship's officer\r\nwhose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken.\r\nEzra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and\r\noriginally mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged\r\npurpose which boded no good to the usurping husband.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of May, 1765, Curwen's only child Ann was born; and was\r\nchristened by the Reverend John Graves of King's Church, of which both\r\nhusband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage,\r\nin order to compromise between their respective Congregational and\r\nBaptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of\r\nthe marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the\r\nchurch and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward\r\nlocated both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the\r\nwidow's change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and\r\nengendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The\r\nbirth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence\r\nwith the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a\r\nduplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak\r\nof the Revolution. Ward had tried this source because he knew that\r\nhis great-great-grandmother, Ann Tillinghast Potter, had been an\r\nEpiscopalian.\r\n\r\nShortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome\r\nwith a fervor greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen\r\nresolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted\r\nScotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since\r\nfamous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to\r\nhave been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney\r\nCourt, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint\r\nof its ultimate disposition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden,\r\nand gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of\r\nsuspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak, giving instant place\r\nto an ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph. It was after this\r\ntransition, which appears to have come early in July, that the sinister\r\nscholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which\r\nonly their long-dead ancestors would seem to be able to impart.\r\n\r\nBut Curwen's feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this\r\nchange. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more\r\nand more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom\r\nhe now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy\r\nhad been. He altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its\r\nprofits were constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent\r\nat the Pawtuxet farm; though there were rumors now and then of his\r\npresence in places which, though not actually near graveyards, were yet\r\nso situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered\r\njust how thorough the old merchant's change of habits really was.\r\nEzra Weeden, though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief\r\nand intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a vindictive\r\npersistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers\r\nlacked; and subjected Curwen's affairs to a scrutiny such as they had\r\nnever had before.\r\n\r\nSmuggling and evasion were the rule in Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal\r\nlandings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces. But Weeden,\r\nnight after night, following the lighters or small sloops which he saw\r\nsteal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon\r\nfelt assured that it was not merely His Majesty's armed ships which the\r\nsinister skulker was anxious to avoid. The lighters were wont to put\r\nout from the black silent docks, and they would go down the bay some\r\ndistance, perhaps as far as Namquit Point, where they would meet and\r\nreceive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied\r\nappearance. Curwen's sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual\r\npoint on the shore, and transport it overland to the farm; locking it\r\nin the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the\r\nNegroes. The cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases, of which\r\na large proportion were oblong and heavy, and disturbingly suggestive\r\nof coffins.\r\n\r\nWeeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity, visiting\r\nit each night for long periods, and seldom letting a week go by\r\nwithout a sight except when the ground bore a footprint-revealing\r\nsnow. Finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties, he hired\r\na tavern companion named Eleazar Smith to continue the survey during\r\nhis absences; and between them the two could have set in motion some\r\nextraordinary rumors. That they did not do so was only because they\r\nknew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make\r\nfurther progress impossible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a\r\ngreat series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizable\r\nstaff of persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the\r\nfarm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth\r\ncentury with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows,\r\nthe laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north, where the roof\r\ncame nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any other; yet\r\njudging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must\r\nhave been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices\r\nran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of\r\nfrantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty,\r\npantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in\r\ndifferent languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping accents were\r\nfrequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening.\r\n\r\nWeeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook,\r\nfor English, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used;\r\nbut of these nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a\r\nfew ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families\r\nwere concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand\r\nwere historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote\r\nplaces and ages. Once, for example, an alternately raging and sullen\r\nfigure was questioned in French about the Black Prince's massacre at\r\nLimoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to\r\nknow. Curwen asked the prisoner--if prisoner it were--whether the order\r\nto slay was given because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar\r\nin the ancient Roman crypt beneath the cathedral, or whether The Dark\r\nMan of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three Words. Failing to\r\nobtain replies, the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means;\r\nfor there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a\r\nbumping sound.\r\n\r\nNone of these colloquies was ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows\r\nwere always heavily draped. Later, no more conversations were ever\r\nheard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded that Curwen had\r\ntransferred his field of action to regions below.\r\n\r\nThat such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many\r\nthings. Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from\r\nwhat appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure;\r\nwhilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the\r\nhigh ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there\r\nwas found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was\r\nobviously an entrance to caverns within the hill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was in January, 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating\r\nvainly on what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering\r\nbusiness, that the incident of the _Fortaleza_ occurred. Exasperated\r\nby the burning of the revenue sloop _Liberty_ at Newport during the\r\nprevious summer, the customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an\r\nincreased vigilance concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion\r\nHis Majesty's armed schooner _Cygnet_, under Captain Charles Leshe,\r\ncaptured after a short pursuit one early morning the scow _Fortaleza_\r\nof Barcelona, Spain, under Captain Manuel Arruda, bound according to\r\nits log from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for\r\ncontraband material, this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its\r\ncargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian mummies, consigned to \"Sailor\r\nA. B. C.,\" who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off\r\nNamquit Point, and whose identity Captain Arruda felt himself in honor\r\nbound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss\r\nwhat to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the\r\none hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand,\r\ncompromised on Collector Robinson's recommendation by freeing the\r\nship but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later\r\nrumors of its having been seen in Boston Harbor, though it never openly\r\nentered the Port of Boston.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence\r\nand there were not many who doubted the existence of some connection\r\nbetween the cargo of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen; it did\r\nnot take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation\r\nwhich could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in\r\nthe town. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of\r\nthe significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories\r\nconcerning Curwen and his monstrous labors.\r\n\r\nThe following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains;\r\nand the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen\r\nfarm. Large sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones\r\ndiscovered; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean\r\nchambers or burrows. Something was rumored, however, at the village\r\nof Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a\r\nrocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. The fisherfolk about\r\nthe bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as\r\nit shot down to the still water below, or the way that another half\r\ncried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of\r\nobjects which normally cry out.\r\n\r\nThat rumor sent Smith--for Weeden was just then at sea--in haste to\r\nthe river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the\r\nevidences of an extensive cave-in. Smith went to the extent of some\r\nexperimental digging, but was deterred by lack of success--or perhaps\r\nby fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on what the\r\npersistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been ashore at\r\nthe time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell\r\nothers of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link\r\ntogether, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge\r\nthat jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first\r\nconfidant he selected Captain James Mathewson of the _Enterprise_,\r\nwho on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity,\r\nand on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be\r\nheard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room\r\nof Sabin's Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate\r\nvirtually every statement; and it could be seen that Captain Mathewson\r\nwas tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town,\r\nhe had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it\r\nneeded only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince\r\nhim absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and\r\nenjoined strict silence upon the two younger men.\r\n\r\nThe right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West,\r\nwhose pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar\r\nand keen thinker; Reverend James Manning, President of the College;\r\nex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical\r\nSociety at Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John\r\nCarter, publisher of the _Gazette_; all four of the Brown brothers,\r\nJohn, Joseph, Nicholas and Moses, who formed the recognized local\r\nmagnates; old Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was considerable, and\r\nwho had much first-hand knowledge of Curwen's odd purchases; and\r\nCaptain Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and\r\nenergy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Captain Mathewson prospered beyond his highest\r\nexpectations; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants\r\nsomewhat skeptical of the possible ghostly side of Weeden's tale, there\r\nwas not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret\r\nand coördinated action. Curwen, it was clear, formed a vague potential\r\nmenace to the welfare of the town and Colony; and must be eliminated at\r\nany cost.\r\n\r\nLate in December, 1770, a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of\r\nStephen Hopkins and debated tentative measures. Weeden's notes, which\r\nhe had given to Captain Mathewson, were carefully read; and he and\r\nSmith were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something very\r\nlike fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over,\r\nthough there ran through that fear a grim determination which Captain\r\nWhipple's bluff and resonant profanity best expressed. They would not\r\nnotify the Governor, because a more than legal course seemed necessary.\r\nWith hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal,\r\nCurwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town. He must\r\nbe surprised at his Pawtuxet farm by a large raiding party of seasoned\r\nprivateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself. If\r\nhe proved a madman, amusing himself with shrieked and imaginary\r\nconversations in different voices, he would be properly confined. If\r\nsomething graver appeared, and if the underground horrors indeed turned\r\nout to be real, he and all with him must die. It could be done quietly,\r\nand even the widow and her father need not be told how it came about.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the\r\ntown an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little\r\nelse was mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moonlit\r\nJanuary night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river\r\nand up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads\r\nto every window; and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white\r\nthing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of\r\nthe Turk's Head. There was a baying of dogs in the distance, but this\r\nsubsided as soon as the clamor of the awakened town became audible.\r\nParties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what\r\nwas happening, but nothing rewarded their search. The next morning,\r\nhowever, a giant, muscular body, stark naked, was found on the jams\r\nof ice around the southern piers of the Great Bridge, where the Long\r\nDock stretched out beside Abbott's distil-house, and the identity of\r\nthis object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering. It\r\nwas not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered, for only\r\nin the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike\r\nany chord of memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged furtive\r\nmurmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff, hideous features lay a\r\nresemblance so marvelous as to be almost an identity--and that identity\r\nwas with a man who had died full fifty years before.\r\n\r\nEzra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying\r\nof the night before, set out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy\r\nDock Bridge whence the sound had come. He had a curious expectancy,\r\nand was not surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled district\r\nwhere the street merged into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very\r\ncurious tracks in the snow. The naked giant had been pursued by dogs\r\nand many booted men, and the returning tracks of the hounds and their\r\nmasters could be easily traced. They had given up the chase upon coming\r\ntoo near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail\r\ntraced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm\r\nof Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given\r\nmuch had the yard been less confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared\r\nnot seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden\r\nwent at once with his report, performed an autopsy on the strange\r\ncorpse, and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The\r\ndigestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use,\r\nwhilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely-knit texture impossible to\r\naccount for. Impressed by what the old man whispered of this body's\r\nlikeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great-grandson\r\nAaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwen's employ, Weeden asked casual\r\nquestions till he found where Green was buried. That night a party of\r\nten visited the old North Burying Ground opposite Herrenden's Lane and\r\nopened a grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"They found the grave vacant--precisely as they had\r\nexpected.\"]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMeanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept\r\nJoseph Curwen's mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body\r\nthere was found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the\r\ncoöperating citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied and preserved in\r\nthe private archives of the Smith family where Charles Ward found it,\r\nran as follows:\r\n\r\n    I delight that you continue in ye getting at Olde Matters in\r\n    your Way, and doe not think better was done at Mr. Hutchinson's\r\n    in Salem-Village. Certainly, there was Noth'g butt ye liveliest\r\n    Awfulness in that which H. rais'd upp from what he cou'd gather\r\n    onlie a part of. What you sente, did not Worke, whether because\r\n    Any Thing miss'g, or because ye Wordes were not Righte from my\r\n    Speak'g or yr copy'g. Alone am at a Loss. I have not ye Chymicall\r\n    art to followe Borellus, and owne my Selfe confounded by ye VII.\r\n    Booke of ye Necronomicon that you recommende. But I wou'd have you\r\n    Observe what was tolde to us aboute tak'g Care whom to calle up,\r\n    for you are Sensible what Mr. Mather writ in ye Magnalia of ----,\r\n    and can judge how truely that Horrendous thing is reported. I say\r\n    to you againe, doe not call upp Any that you can not put downe; by\r\n    the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against\r\n    you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of\r\n    the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall\r\n    commande more than you. I was frighted when I read of your know'g\r\n    what Ben Zariatnatmik hadde in his Ebony Boxe, for I was conscious\r\n    who must have told you. And againe I ask that you shalle write me\r\n    as Jedediah and not Simon. In this Community a Man may not live too\r\n    long, and you knowe my Plan by which I came back as my Son. I am\r\n    desirous you will Acquaint me with what ye Blacke Man learnt from\r\n    Sylvanus Cocidius in ye Vault, under ye Roman wall, and will be\r\n    oblig'd for ye Lend'g of ye MS. you speak of.\r\n\r\nAnother and unsigned letter from Philadelphia provoked equal thought,\r\nespecially for the following passage:\r\n\r\n    I will observe what you say respecting the sending of Accounts only\r\n    by yr Vessels, but can not always be certain when to expect them.\r\n    In the Matter spoke of, I require only one more thing; but wish to\r\n    be sure I apprehend you exactly. You inform me, that no Part must\r\n    be missing if the finest Effects are to be had, but you can not but\r\n    know how hard it is to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and Burthen\r\n    to take away the whole Box, and in Town (i. e. St. Peter's, St.\r\n    Paul's, St. Mary's, or Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all.\r\n    But I know what Imperfections were in the one rais'd up October\r\n    last, and how many live Specimens you were forced to imploy before\r\n    you hit upon the right Mode in the year 1766; so will be guided by\r\n    you in all Matters. I am impatient for yr Brig, and inquire daily\r\n    at Mr. Biddle's Wharf.\r\n\r\nA third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an\r\nunknown alphabet. In the Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single\r\noft-repeated combination of characters is clumsily copied; and\r\nauthorities at Brown University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic\r\nor Abyssinian, although they do not recognize the word. None of these\r\nepistles was ever delivered to Curwen, though the disappearance of\r\nJedediah Orne from Salem as recorded shortly afterward showed that the\r\nProvidence men took certain quiet steps.\r\n\r\nCurwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in\r\nthe wind; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look.\r\nHis coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the Pawtuxet Road,\r\nand he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which\r\nhe had latterly sought to combat the town's prejudice. The nearest\r\nneighbors to his farm, the Fenners, one night remarked a great shaft\r\nof light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that\r\ncryptical stone building with the high excessively narrow windows; an\r\nevent which they quickly communicated to John Brown in Providence.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent\r\non Curwen's extirpation, and had informed the Fenners that some\r\naction was about to be taken. To them Mr. Brown had entrusted the duty\r\nof watching the Curwen farmhouse, and of regularly reporting every\r\nincident which took place there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things,\r\nas suggested by the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action\r\nso carefully devised by the band of serious citizens. According to the\r\nSmith diary a company of about one hundred men met at ten P.M.\r\non Friday, April twelfth, 1771, in the great room of Thurston's Tavern\r\nat the Sign of the Golden Lion on Weybosset Point across the Bridge.\r\nOf the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader,\r\nJohn Brown, there were present Dr. Bowen, with his case of surgical\r\ninstruments, President Manning without the great periwig (the largest\r\nin the Colonies) for which he was noted, Governor Hopkins, wrapped in\r\na dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother Eseh whom he had\r\ninitiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest, John\r\nCarter, Captain Mathewson, and Captain Whipple, who was to lead the\r\nactual raiding party. These chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber,\r\nafter which Captain Whipple emerged to the great room and gave the\r\ngathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith was\r\nwith the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival\r\nof Ezra Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report the\r\ndeparture of his coach for the farm.\r\n\r\nAbout ten-thirty a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed\r\nby the sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there\r\nwas no need of waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed\r\nman had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment\r\nlater, as the receding coach clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock\r\nBridge, Weeden appeared; and the raiders fell silently into military\r\norder in the street, shouldering the firelocks, fowling-pieces, or\r\nwhaling harpoons which they had with them. Weeden and Smith were with\r\nthe party, and of the deliberating citizens there were present for\r\nactive service Captain Whipple, the leader, Captain Eseh Hopkins, John\r\nCarter, President Manning, Captain Mathewson, and Dr. Bowen; together\r\nwith Moses Brown, who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent\r\nfrom the preliminary session in the tavern. All these freemen and their\r\nhundred sailors began the long march without delay, grim and a trifle\r\napprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock behind and mounted the gentle\r\nrise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road.\r\n\r\nAn hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed,\r\nat the Fenner farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their\r\nintended victim. He had reached his farm more than half an hour before,\r\nand the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky. There\r\nwere no lights in any visible windows, but this was always the case of\r\nlate. Even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the\r\nsouth, and the party realized that they had indeed come close to the\r\nscene of awesome and unnatural wonders. Captain Whipple now ordered his\r\nforce to separate into three divisions; one of twenty men under Eleazar\r\nSmith to strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against\r\npossible reinforcements for Curwen until summoned by a messenger for\r\ndesperate service; a second of twenty men under Captain Eseh Hopkins to\r\nsteal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish\r\nwith axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank; and\r\nthe third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves.\r\nOf this last division one third was to be led by Captain Mathewson to\r\nthe cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third to\r\nfollow Captain Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining\r\nthird to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until\r\nsummoned by a final emergency signal.\r\n\r\nThe river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a\r\nsingle whistle-blast, waiting and capturing anything which might issue\r\nfrom the regions within. At the sound of two whistle blasts it would\r\nadvance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of\r\nthe raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept\r\nthese respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance\r\nat the first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the\r\nground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare\r\nexpected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal\r\nof three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general\r\nguard duty; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown\r\ndepths through both farmhouse and stone building. Captain Whipple's\r\nbelief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no\r\nalternative into consideration when making his plans. He had with him\r\na whistle of great power and shrillness and did not fear any mistaking\r\nor misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at the landing, of\r\ncourse, was nearly out of the whistle's range; hence, would require a\r\nspecial messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went\r\nwith Captain Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was\r\ndetailed with Captain Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with\r\nEzra Weeden, remained in Captain Whipple's party which was to storm the\r\nfarmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from\r\nCaptain Hopkins had joined Captain Whipple to notify him of the river\r\nparty's readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast,\r\nand the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous\r\nattack on three points. Shortly before one A.M. the three\r\ndivisions left the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another\r\nto seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to\r\nsubdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in\r\nhis diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the\r\nbay; broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal\r\nwhistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying\r\nand a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction. Later\r\non one man thought he caught some distant gunshots, and still later\r\nSmith himself felt the throb of titanic thunderous words resounding\r\nin upper air. It was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger\r\nwith wild eyes and a hideous unknown odor about his clothing appeared\r\nand told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never\r\nagain think or speak of the night's doings or of him who had been\r\nJoseph Curwen. Something about the bearing of the messenger carried\r\na conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed; for\r\nthough he was a seaman well known to many of them, there was something\r\nobscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart.\r\nIt was the same later on when they met other old companions who\r\nhad gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had lost or gained\r\nsomething imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or heard or\r\nfelt something which was not for human creatures, and could not forget\r\nit. From them there was never any gossip, for to even the commonest of\r\nmortal instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that single\r\nmessenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost\r\nsealed their own lips. Very few are the rumors which ever came from any\r\nof them, and Eleazar Smith's diary is the only written record which has\r\nsurvived from that whole expedition which set forth from the Sign of\r\nthe Golden Lion under the Stars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCharles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some\r\nFenner correspondence which he found in New London, where he knew\r\nanother branch of the family had lived. It seems that the Fenners,\r\nfrom whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible, had watched\r\nthe departing columns of raiders; and had heard very clearly the\r\nangry barking of the Curwen dogs, followed by the first shrill blast\r\nwhich precipitated the attack. This blast had been followed by a\r\nrepetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building, and in\r\nanother moment, after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a\r\ngeneral invasion, there had come a subdued rattle of musketry followed\r\nby a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent Luke Fenner had\r\nrepresented in his epistle by the characters \"Waaaahrrrrr--R'waaahrrr.\"\r\nThis cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing\r\ncould convey, and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted\r\ncompletely at the sound. It was later repeated less loudly, and\r\nfurther but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued; together with\r\na loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river. About an\r\nhour afterward all the dogs began to bay frightfully, and there were\r\nvague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the\r\nmantelpiece. A strong smell of sulphur was noted; and Luke Fenner's\r\nfather declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal,\r\nthough the others failed to detect it. Muffled musketry sounded again,\r\nfollowed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than\r\nthose which had preceded it; a kind of throaty, nastily plastic cough\r\nor gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its\r\ncontinuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value.\r\n\r\nThen the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen\r\nfarm ought to lie, and the human cries of desperate and frightened men\r\nwere heard. Muskets flashed and cracked, and the flaming thing fell\r\nto the ground. A second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human\r\norigin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even\r\ngather a few words belched in frenzy: \"Almighty, protect thy lamb!\"\r\nThen there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. After\r\nthat came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of\r\nwhich time little Arthur Fenner, Luke's brother, exclaimed that he\r\nsaw \"a red fog\" going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the\r\ndistance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke admits\r\nthe significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive\r\nfright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur\r\nof the three cats then within the room.\r\n\r\nFive minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused\r\nwith such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the\r\nsea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by\r\nany wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which\r\nany of the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of\r\nclutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house.\r\nClose upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be\r\nable to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and windows\r\nrattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as\r\na bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it\r\nsaid no man can tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is\r\nthe writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations:\r\n\"DEESMEES--JESHET--BONEDOSEFEDUVEMA--ENITEMOSS.\" Not till the year 1919\r\ndid any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal\r\nknowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he recognized what Mirandola\r\nhad denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magic's\r\nincantations.\r\n\r\nAn unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer\r\nthis malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown\r\nstench grew complex with an added odor equally intolerable. A wailing\r\ndistinctly different from the scream now burst out and was protracted\r\nululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost\r\narticulate, though no auditor could trace any definite words; and\r\nat one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and\r\nhysterical laughter. Then a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark\r\nmadness wrenched from scores of human throats; a yell which came strong\r\nand clear despite the depth from which it must have burst; after which\r\ndarkness and silence ruled all things. Spirals of acrid smoke ascended\r\nto blot out the stars, though no flames appeared, and no buildings were\r\nobserved to be gone or injured on the following day.\r\n\r\nToward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable\r\nodor saturating their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested\r\na keg of rum for which they paid very well indeed. One of them told\r\nthe family that the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and that the\r\nevents of the night were not to be mentioned again. Arrogant as the\r\norder seemed, the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment\r\nand lent it a fearsome authority; so that only these furtive letters\r\nof Luke Fenner, which he urged his Connecticut relative to destroy,\r\nremain to tell what was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that\r\nrelative, whereby the letters were saved after all, has alone kept\r\nthe matter from a merciful oblivion. Charles Ward had one detail to\r\nadd as a result of a long canvass of Pawtuxet residents for ancestral\r\ntraditions. Old Charles Slocum of that village said that there was\r\nknown to his grandfather a queer rumor concerning a charred, distorted\r\nbody found in the fields a week after the death of Joseph Curwen was\r\nannounced. What kept the talk alive was the notion that this body, so\r\nfar as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition, was neither\r\nthoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk\r\nhad ever seen or read about.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be\r\ninduced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague\r\ndata which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party.\r\nThere is something frightful in the care with which these actual\r\nraiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nEight sailors had been killed, but although their bodies were not\r\nproduced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash\r\nwith customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered\r\nthe numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged\r\nand treated only by Dr. Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party.\r\nHardest to explain was the nameless odor clinging to all the raiders,\r\na thing which was discussed for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Captain\r\nWhipple and Moses Brown were most severely hurt, and letters of their\r\nwives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding\r\nof their bandages produced. Psychologically every participant was\r\naged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they were all strong\r\nmen of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle\r\nintrospectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill\r\nindeed. President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew\r\nthe darkest shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of\r\nthose leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is\r\nperhaps fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelve-month\r\nafterward Captain Whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship\r\n_Gaspee_, and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting\r\nout of unwholesome images.\r\n\r\nThere was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden\r\ncoffin of curious design, obviously found ready on the spot when\r\nneeded, in which she was told her husband's body lay. He had, it was\r\nexplained, been killed in a customs battle about which it was not\r\npolitic to give details. More than this no tongue ever uttered of\r\nJoseph Curwen's end, and Charles Ward had only a single hint wherewith\r\nto construct a theory. This hint was the merest thread--a shaky\r\nunderscoring of a passage in Jedediah Orne's confiscated letter to\r\nCurwen, partly copied in Ezra Weeden's handwriting. The copy was found\r\nin the possession of Smith's descendants; and we are left to decide\r\nwhether Weeden gave it to his companion after the end, as a mute clue\r\nto the abnormality which had occurred, or whether, as is more probable,\r\nSmith had it before, and added the underscoring himself from what he\r\nhad managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit\r\ncross-questioning. The underlined passage is merely this:\r\n\r\n    I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you cannot put downe;\r\n    by the which I meane, Any that can in turn calle up somewhat\r\n    against you, whereby your powerfullest Devices may not be of use.\r\n    Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and\r\n    shall commande more than you.\r\n\r\nIn the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable\r\nallies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity,\r\nCharles Ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of Providence\r\nkilled Joseph Curwen.\r\n\r\nThe deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from\r\nProvidence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the\r\nraiding leaders. They had not at first meant to be so thorough, and\r\nhad allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance\r\nof the true conditions; but Captain Tillinghast was an astute man,\r\nand soon uncovered enough rumors to whet his horror and cause him to\r\ndemand that his daughter and grand-daughter change their name, burn the\r\nlibrary and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from the\r\nslate slab above Joseph Curwen's grave. He knew Captain Whipple well,\r\nand probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone\r\nelse ever gained respecting the end of the accursed sorcerer.\r\n\r\nFrom that time on the obliteration of Curwen's memory became\r\nincreasingly rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the\r\ntown records and files of the _Gazette_. It can be compared in spirit\r\nonly to the hush that lay on Oscar Wilde's name for a decade after his\r\ndisgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that sinful King of Runagur\r\nin Lord Dunsany's tale, whom the gods decided must not only cease to\r\nbe, but must cease ever to have been.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the\r\nhouse in Olney Court and resided with her father in Power's Lane till\r\nher death in 1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living\r\nsoul, remained to molder through the years; and seemed to decay with\r\nunaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were\r\nstanding, and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None\r\nventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which\r\nthe hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite\r\nimage of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the\r\nhorrors he had wrought.\r\n\r\nOnly robust old Captain Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter\r\nonce in awhile to himself, \"Pox on that ----, but he had no business to\r\nlaugh while he screamed. 'Twas as though the damn'd ---- had some 'at\r\nup his sleeve. For half a crown I'd burn his ---- house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _3. A Search and an Evocation_\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent\r\nfrom Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in\r\neverything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at;\r\nfor every vague rumor that he had heard of Curwen now became something\r\nvital to himself, in whom flowed Curwen's blood.\r\n\r\nIn his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at\r\nsecrecy; he talked freely with his family--though his mother was not\r\nparticularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen--and with the\r\nofficials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying\r\nto private families for records thought to be in their possession\r\nhe made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat\r\namused skepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and\r\nletter-writers were regarded.\r\n\r\nWhen he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered\r\nthe letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look\r\nup Curwen's early activities and connections there, which he did\r\nduring the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which\r\nwas well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town\r\nof crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very\r\nkindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen\r\ndata. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now\r\nDanvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O. S.)\r\n1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not\r\nappearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech,\r\ndress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper.\r\nAt that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of\r\nhis hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the\r\nstrange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France,\r\nand Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of\r\nmuch local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague\r\nrumors of fires on the hills at night.\r\n\r\nCurwen's only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of\r\nSalem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. Hutchinson had a house well\r\nout toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive\r\npeople because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to\r\nentertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were\r\nnot always of the same color. The knowledge he displayed concerning\r\nlong-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly\r\nunwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic\r\nbegan, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also\r\ndeparted, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon\r\nOrne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old\r\nbegan to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty\r\nyears later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to\r\nclaim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents\r\nin Simon Orne's known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in\r\nSalem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the\r\nReverend Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to\r\nparts unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCertain documents by and about all of these strange matters were\r\navailable at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry\r\nof Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles\r\nand bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative\r\nnature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on\r\nthe witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on\r\nJuly sixteenth, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminen under Judge\r\nHathorne, that \"fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete\r\nin the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinson's house,\" and one Amity How\r\ndeclared at a session of August eighth before Judge Gedney that \"Mr.\r\nG. B. (George Burroughs) on that Nighte put the Divell his Marke upon\r\nBridget S., Jonathan A., _Simon O._, Deliverance W., _Joseph C._,\r\nSusan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.\" Then there was a catalogue of\r\nHutchinson's uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an\r\nunfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none\r\ncould read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and\r\nbegan to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to\r\nhim. After the following August his labors on the cipher became intense\r\nand feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and\r\nconduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never\r\nstated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.\r\n\r\nBut of greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took\r\nWard only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing\r\nhe had already considered established from the text of the letter to\r\nCurwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the\r\nsame person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly\r\nsafe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year\r\nsojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a\r\nrepresentative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to\r\ndestroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action\r\nin 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited\r\ntheir wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other\r\nhands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and\r\none extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher\r\nrecognized from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph\r\nCurwen's.\r\n\r\n                                                      Providence, 1 May\r\n\r\n    Brother:\r\n\r\n    My honour'd Antient friend, due Respects and earnest Wishes to\r\n    Him whom we serve for yr Eternall Power.

The place was indeed only a few\r\nsquares from his own home on the great hill's higher ground, and was\r\nnow the abode of a Negro family much esteemed for occasional washing,\r\nhousecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem,\r\nsuch sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his\r\nown family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he\r\nresolved to explore the place immediately upon his return.\r\n\r\nThe more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some\r\nextravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted\r\nwith a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to--Job\r\n14, 14--was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All\r\nthe days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYoung Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent\r\nthe following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house\r\nin Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a\r\nmansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of\r\nthe familiar Providence Colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large\r\ncentral chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fan-light,\r\ntriangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but\r\nlittle alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something\r\nvery close to the sinister matters of his quest.\r\n\r\nThe present Negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very\r\ncourteously shown about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife\r\nHannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward\r\nsaw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels\r\nand shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine\r\nwainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged,\r\nor covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. It was exciting to\r\nstand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror\r\nas Joseph Curwen; he saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very\r\ncarefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.\r\n\r\nFrom then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the\r\nphotostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local\r\nCurwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter\r\nhe obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere,\r\nthat he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York\r\nto consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated.\r\nThis trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters\r\nwith their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and\r\nthe Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait\r\npainted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait\r\ninterested him particularly, since he would have given much to know\r\njust what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second\r\nsearch of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some\r\ntrace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or\r\nlayers of mouldy wall-paper.\r\n\r\nEarly in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully\r\nover the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any\r\npossibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention\r\nto the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was\r\nkeenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the\r\nfireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the\r\nsurface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was\r\nsensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it\r\nwas likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife,\r\nand he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent.\r\nWith truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which\r\nan immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife\r\nmight have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to\r\nenlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long\r\nexperience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of\r\nCollege Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work\r\nat once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his\r\nwife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly\r\nreimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.\r\n\r\nAs day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked\r\non with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled\r\nafter their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since\r\nthe picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out\r\nfor some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare,\r\nwell-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin\r\nsmall-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair\r\nagainst the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When\r\nthe head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and\r\nto possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow\r\nfamiliar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though,\r\ndid the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment\r\nat the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognize with\r\na touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For\r\nit took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate\r\nscraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden;\r\nand to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the\r\npast, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible\r\ngreat-great-great-grandfather.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWard brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and\r\nhis father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its\r\nexecution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite\r\nan appearance of rather greater age, was marvelous; and it could\r\nbe seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours\r\nof Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and\r\na half. Mrs. Ward's resemblance to her ancestor was not at all\r\nmarked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial\r\ncharacteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did\r\nnot relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better\r\nburn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred,\r\nsomething unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very\r\nresemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power\r\nand affairs--a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint\r\nin the Pawtuxet Valley--and not one to listen to feminine scruples.\r\nThe picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and\r\nhe believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is\r\nneedless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later\r\nMr. Ward located the owner of the house--a small rodent-featured person\r\nwith a guttural accent--and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel\r\nbearing the picture at a curtly fixed price which cut short the\r\nimpending torrent of unctuous haggling.\r\n\r\nIt now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward\r\nhome, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and\r\ninstallation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charles' third-floor\r\nstudy or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending\r\nthis removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two\r\nexpert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney\r\nCourt, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached\r\nwith great care and precision for transportation in the company's\r\nmotor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the\r\nchimney's course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess\r\nabout a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head\r\nof the portrait. He found, beneath the deep coatings of dust and\r\nsoot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copy-book, and a few\r\nmoldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the\r\nrest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took\r\nup the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was\r\nin a hand which he had learned to recognize at the Essex Institute,\r\nand proclaimed the volume as the \"_Journall and Notes of Jos. Curwen,\r\nGent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem._\"\r\n\r\nExcited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward showed the book to the\r\ntwo curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to\r\nthe nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on\r\nthem to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he\r\nbegan his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in\r\nCurwen's handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous\r\nbecause of its inscription: \"_To Him Who Shal Come After, How He May\r\nGett Beyonde Time and Ye Spheres._\" Another was in a cipher; the same,\r\nWard hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him.\r\nA third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the\r\ncipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to\r\n\"Edw. Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", \"or Their Heir or\r\nHeirs, or Those Represent'g Them.\" The sixth and last was inscribed:\r\n\"_Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Bet'n ye yeares 1678 and 1687: of\r\nWhither He Voyag'd, Where He Stay'd, Whom He Sawe, and What He learnt._\"\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the point from which the more academic school of\r\nalienists date Charles Ward's madness. Upon his discovery the youth\r\nhad looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and\r\nmanuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him\r\ntremendously. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost\r\nembarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme\r\nimportance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not\r\neven show the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he\r\nhad found some documents in Joseph Curwen's handwriting, \"mostly in\r\ncipher,\" which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding\r\nup their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shown what he\r\ndid to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As\r\nit was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence\r\nwhich would increase their discussion of the matter.\r\n\r\nThat night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book\r\nand papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his\r\nurgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were\r\nsent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when\r\nthe men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his\r\nstudy. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile\r\nwrestling feverishly with the unraveling of the cipher manuscript. In\r\nthe morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy\r\nof the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently showed her before;\r\nbut in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be\r\napplied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the\r\nmen fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture\r\nwith its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the\r\nmock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a\r\nchimney existed, and boxing in its sides with panelling to match the\r\nroom's. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and\r\nsat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the\r\nportrait which stared back at him like a year-adding century-recalling\r\nmirror. His parents subsequently recalling his conduct at this period,\r\ngive interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he\r\npracticed. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be\r\nstudying, since he rightly assumed that Curwen's intricate and archaic\r\nchirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however,\r\nhe was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were\r\na cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs\r\n(as that entitled \"_To Him Who Shal Come After_ etc.\" seemed to be)\r\nhe would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had\r\ndeparted. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique\r\ncabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room.\r\nHe soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long\r\nwalks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of\r\nschool, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to\r\nhim; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with\r\ncollege. He had, he said, important special investigations to make,\r\nwhich would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the\r\nhumanities than any university which the world could boast.\r\n\r\nDuring October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer\r\nfor the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic,\r\noccultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence\r\nsources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap\r\nthe wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library\r\nat Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain\r\nrare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively,\r\nand fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly\r\nacquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays\r\nhe made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult\r\ncertain records at the Essex Institute.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January, 1920, there entered Ward's bearing an\r\nelement of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found\r\nat work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual\r\npolicy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the\r\none a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter\r\nhaunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local\r\ndealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave\r\nastonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and\r\ninstruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall,\r\nand the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second\r\ninterest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of\r\nJoseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely\r\nblotted the name.\r\n\r\nLittle by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that\r\nsomething was wrong. His school work was the merest pretence; he had\r\nother concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score\r\nof obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old\r\nburial records downtown or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his\r\nstudy, where the startlingly--one almost fancied increasingly--similar\r\nfeatures of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great\r\novermantel on the north wall.\r\n\r\nLate in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of\r\nrambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. His quest\r\nhad suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one\r\nNaphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over\r\nthe files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a\r\nfragmentary record of Curwen's burial which had escaped the general\r\nobliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been\r\ninterred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Field's grave in ye----.\"\r\nHence the rambles--from which St. John's (the former King's) churchyard\r\nand the ancient Congregational burying ground in the midst of Swan\r\nPoint Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the\r\nonly Naphthali Field (obit. 1729) whose grave could have been meant had\r\nbeen a Baptist.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward,\r\nand fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned\r\nfrom Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The\r\ninterview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at\r\nevery moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch\r\nwith matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive\r\nyouth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanor. Of a\r\npallid, impassive type not easily showing embarrassment, Ward seemed\r\nquite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object.\r\nHe stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable\r\nsecrets of early scientific knowledge. To take their vivid place in the\r\nhistory of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar\r\nwith the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of\r\ncorrelation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as\r\nfast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter\r\nof the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full\r\nannouncement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to\r\nthe world of thought.\r\n\r\nAs to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the\r\ndetails of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to\r\nthink that Joseph Curwen's mutilated headstone bore certain mystic\r\nsymbols--carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by\r\nthose who had effaced the name--which were absolutely essential to the\r\nfinal solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished\r\nto guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the\r\ndata in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see\r\nthe mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put\r\nhim off with such things as the photostatic copies of the Hutchinson\r\ncipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally showed him the\r\nexteriors of some of the real Curwen finds--the \"_Journal and Notes_,\"\r\nthe cipher (title in cipher also) and the formula-filled message \"_To\r\nHim Who Shal Come After_\"--and let him glance inside such as were in\r\nobscure characters.\r\n\r\nHe also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its\r\ninnocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwen's connected\r\nhandwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and\r\ncomplicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century\r\nwhich clung round both penmanship and style despite the writer's\r\nsurvival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that\r\nthe document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and\r\nWillett recalled only a fragment. But when Dr. Willett turned the leaf,\r\nhe was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his\r\ngrasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page\r\nwas a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered\r\ntenaciously in his memory.\r\n\r\nThey ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus be'g spoke V Roodmasses and IV\r\nHallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breed'g Outside ye Spheres. It\r\nwill drawe One who is to Come if I can make sure he shal bee, and he\r\nshall think on Past thinges and looke back thro' all ye yeares, against\r\nye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make 'em with.\"\r\n\r\nWillett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and\r\nvague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared\r\nblandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the\r\nodd fancy--which his medical skill of course assured him was only a\r\nfancy--that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of tendency to follow\r\nyoung Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before\r\nleaving to study the picture closely, marveling at its resemblance to\r\nCharles and memorizing every minute detail of the cryptical, colorless\r\nface, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the\r\nright eye.\r\n\r\nAssured by the doctor that Charles' mental health was in no danger,\r\nbut that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might\r\nprove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might\r\notherwise have been when during the following June the youth made\r\npositive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies\r\nof much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go\r\nabroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources\r\nof data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this\r\nlatter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding\r\nthe university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the\r\nMoses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three year period of\r\nintensive occult study and graveyard searching.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nComing of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small\r\ncompetence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to\r\ntake the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary\r\nhe would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry\r\nhim to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and\r\nfaithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all\r\nopposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young\r\nman sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father\r\nand mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight\r\nfrom the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe\r\narrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street,\r\nLondon; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till\r\nhe had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain\r\ndirection. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little\r\nto write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned\r\na laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he\r\nsaid nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its\r\nluring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads\r\nand alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately\r\nbeckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the\r\ndegree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to\r\nwhich he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the\r\nBibliotheque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal\r\ncards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a\r\nspecial search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed\r\nprivate collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought\r\nback reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October\r\nthe Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating\r\nthat Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring\r\nwith a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor\r\nof some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in\r\nthe Newstadt, and announced no move till the following January; when\r\nhe dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through\r\nthat city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his\r\ncorrespondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.\r\n\r\nThe next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of\r\nWard's progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron\r\nFerenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to\r\nbe addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from\r\nRakus a week later, saying that his host's carriage had met him and\r\nthat he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message\r\nfor a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents'\r\nfrequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his\r\nmother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when\r\nthe elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he\r\nsaid, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while\r\nthe situation of Baron Ferenczy's castle did not favor visits. It was\r\non a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned\r\nby the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at\r\nease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct\r\nand conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had\r\nidiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would\r\nbe better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to\r\nProvidence; which could scarcely be far distant.\r\n\r\nThat return did not, however, take place until May, 1925, when after a\r\nfew heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on\r\nthe _Homeric_ and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor coach\r\neagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming\r\norchards, and the white steepled towns of Connecticut in spring; his\r\nfirst taste of ancient New England in nearly four years.\r\n\r\nOld Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its\r\nlong, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which\r\nhad drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no\r\nprophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the\r\ncase might be, for which all his years of travel and application\r\nhad been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office\r\nSquare with its glimpse of the river, and up the steep curved slope\r\nof Waterman Street to Prospect. Then eight squares past the fine old\r\nestates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks\r\nso often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white\r\novertaken farmhouse on the right, and on the left the classic Adam\r\nporch and stately bayed façade of the great brick house where he was\r\nborn. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.\r\n\r\nWard was now visibly aged and hardened, but was still normal in his\r\ngeneral reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed\r\na balance which no madman--even an incipient one--could feign\r\ncontinuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at\r\nthis period were the _sounds_ heard at all hours from Ward's attic\r\nlaboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were\r\nchantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny\r\nrhythms; and although these sounds were always in Ward's own voice,\r\nthere was something in the quality of that voice and in the accents\r\nof the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of\r\nevery hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black\r\ncat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when\r\ncertain of the tones were heard.\r\n\r\nThe odors occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise\r\nexceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often\r\nthey were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to\r\nhave the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them\r\nhad a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with\r\nstrange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching\r\noff into infinite distance. His older aspect increased to a startling\r\ndegree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr.\r\nWillett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at\r\nthe virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the\r\npicture's right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard\r\nfrom the living youth. Frequently he noted peculiar things about;\r\nlittle wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the\r\nhalf-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or\r\ncharcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always\r\nin the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became\r\nvery difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charles'\r\nmadness.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about\r\nmidnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed\r\nunpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill\r\nwind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which\r\neveryone in the neighborhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited\r\nphenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile\r\naround. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for\r\nthe season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward\r\nbelieved the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what\r\ndamage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic;\r\npale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of\r\ntriumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house\r\nhad not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over.\r\nThe thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died\r\naway. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Ward's face\r\ncrystallized into a very singular expression.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined\r\nthan usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the\r\nweather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of\r\nthe ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight,\r\nand did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful,\r\nheard a rumbling motor draw up the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths\r\ncould be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window,\r\nsaw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at\r\nCharles' direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard\r\nlabored breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a\r\ndull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again,\r\nand the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.\r\n\r\nThe next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing\r\ndown the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be\r\nworking on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one,\r\nand steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching\r\nsound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs.\r\nWard rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told\r\nher that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench\r\nnow welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary.\r\nSolitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for\r\ndinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds\r\nwhich came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear;\r\nwearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter\r\nthe laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning\r\nof a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person\r\npermitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the\r\nadjacent storeroom which he cleared out, furnished roughly, and added\r\nto his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he\r\nlived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time\r\nhe purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family\r\nand damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr.\r\nWillett, having fixed the date from statements by various members\r\nof the household, looked up an intact copy at the _Journal_ office\r\nand found that in the destroyed section the following small item had\r\noccurred:\r\n\r\n          Nocturnal Diggers Surprised in North Burial Ground\r\n\r\n    Robert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this\r\n    morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in\r\n    the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off\r\n    before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.\r\n\r\n    The discovery took place at about four o'clock, when Hart's\r\n    attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his\r\n    shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive\r\n    several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his\r\n    feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily\r\n    placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street\r\n    before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was\r\n    disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they\r\n    wished to bury.\r\n\r\n    The diggers must have been at work for a long while before\r\n    detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable\r\n    distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amosa Field, where\r\n    most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place\r\n    as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with\r\n    any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.\r\n\r\n    Sergeant Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the\r\n    opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and\r\n    ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely\r\n    to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the\r\n    escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not\r\n    be sure.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days Charles Ward was seldom seen by his family.\r\nHaving added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to\r\nhimself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it\r\nin until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous\r\nformulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals,\r\nwhile at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of\r\ntinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas\r\nflames. Odors of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before\r\nnoted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable\r\nin the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as\r\nto excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the\r\nAthenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to\r\nfetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written\r\nportentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr.\r\nWillett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about\r\nit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While\r\nnothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very\r\nterrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great\r\nsignificance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of\r\nwhich the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss\r\nas an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began\r\nrepeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same\r\ntime burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the\r\nentire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside\r\nthe locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorizing it as she\r\nwaited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it\r\ndown at Dr. Willett's request. It ran as follows, and experts have told\r\nDr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic\r\nwritings of \"Eliphas Levi,\" that cryptic soul who crept through a crack\r\nin the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void\r\nbeyond:\r\n\r\n    Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova, Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton Ou\r\n    Agla Methon, verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae, conventus\r\n    sylvorum, antra, gnomorum, daemonia Coeli God, Almonsin, Gibor,\r\n    Jehosua, Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\r\n\r\nThis had been going on for two hours without change or intermission\r\nwhen over all the neighborhood a pandemoniac howling of dogs set in.\r\nThe extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received\r\nin the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was\r\nover-shadowed by the odor which instantly followed it; a hideous,\r\nall-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have\r\never smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a\r\nvery perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been\r\nblinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard\r\n_the voice_ that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous\r\nremoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to\r\nCharles Ward's voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at\r\nleast two neighbors above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had\r\nbeen listening in despair outside her son's locked laboratory, shivered\r\nas she recognized its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its\r\nevil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered,\r\naccording to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on\r\nthe night of Joseph Curwen's annihilation. There was no mistaking that\r\nnightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old\r\ndays when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet\r\nit was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES\r\nMIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS.\"\r\n\r\nClose upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening\r\nof the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant,\r\nand then a puff of added odor, different from the first but\r\nequally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again\r\nnow and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like\r\n\"Yi-ngah-Yog-Sothoth-he-lglb-fi-throdag\"--ending in a \"Yah!\" whose\r\nmaniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later\r\nall previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst\r\nout with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm\r\nof diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear\r\nand blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly\r\nat the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She\r\nknocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this\r\none unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and _sounding\r\nconcurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other\r\nvoice_. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall\r\nthe precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful\r\ndeletions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past\r\nsix; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened\r\nservants that she was probably watching at Charles' door, from which\r\nthe sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs\r\nat once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the\r\ncorridor outside the laboratory; and realizing that she had fainted,\r\nhastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighboring\r\nalcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe\r\nan immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered\r\nopening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to\r\nreduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the\r\nseemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be,\r\nbut held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low\r\nfor comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.\r\n\r\nIt was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this\r\nmuttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or\r\nimitation of a dialogue, with the regular alternation of inflections\r\nsuggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice\r\nwas undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and\r\nhollowness which the youth's best powers of ceremonial mimicry had\r\nscarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous,\r\nand abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife\r\nwhich cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts, it is not\r\nlikely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly\r\na year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he\r\nseized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before\r\nshe could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even\r\nso, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something\r\nhimself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For\r\nMrs. Ward's cry had evidently been heard by others than he and there\r\nhad come in response to it from behind the locked door the first\r\ndistinguishable words which that hushed and terrible colloquy had\r\nyielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charles' own voice, but\r\nsomehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who\r\noverheard them. The phrase was just this: \"_Sshh!--write!_\"\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former\r\nresolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night.\r\nNo matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be\r\npermitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of\r\nsanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the\r\nentire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of\r\nhis senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild\r\nscreams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present\r\nday had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be\r\nmade ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for\r\nCharles' laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the\r\nsounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his\r\nson. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled,\r\nand upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within,\r\nexcitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size\r\nand shape. Charles' aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped\r\nhis entire load with a start at the sound of his father's voice. At\r\nthe elder man's command he sat down, and for some time listened to the\r\nadmonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of\r\nthe lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises,\r\nmutterings, incantations, and chemical odors were indeed inexcusable\r\nnuisances. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the\r\nkeenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard\r\nwas part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental\r\natmosphere. His use of abstruse chemical terms somewhat bewildered\r\nMr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and\r\npoise, despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. Mr. Ward\r\nhardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious\r\nas the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an\r\nhour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.\r\n\r\nDriven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now\r\nglanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had\r\ntaken up to the attic. The youth's library was plainly and rigidly\r\nclassified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least\r\nthe kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward\r\nwas astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian,\r\nbeyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new\r\nwithdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises,\r\ngeographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain\r\ncontemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift\r\nfrom Charles Ward's recent run of reading, and the father paused in a\r\ngrowing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The\r\nstrangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his\r\nchest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was\r\nindeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so.\r\n\r\nOn the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the\r\nhouse in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored\r\noils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal\r\nheating had done their work at last, and at some time since the room's\r\nlast cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood,\r\ncurling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with\r\nwhat must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph\r\nCurwen had resigned for ever its staring surveillance of the youth it\r\nso strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin\r\ncoating of fine bluish-gray dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _4. A Mutation and a Madness_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the week following that memorable Good Friday, Charles Ward was seen\r\nmore often than usual, and was continually carrying books between his\r\nlibrary and the attic laboratory. His actions were quiet and rational,\r\nbut he had a furtive, hunted look which his mother did not like, and\r\ndeveloped an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon\r\nthe cook.\r\n\r\nDr. Willett had been told of those Friday noises and happenings, and\r\non the following Tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the\r\nlibrary where the picture stared no more. The interview was, as always,\r\ninconclusive; but Willett is still ready to swear that the youth\r\nwas sane and himself at the time. He held out promises of an early\r\nrevelation, and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere.\r\nAt the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering\r\nhis first enthusiasm over it, but seemed to find something of positive\r\nhumor in its sudden crumbling.\r\n\r\nAbout the second week Charles began to be absent from the house for\r\nlong periods, and one day when good old black Hannah came to help with\r\nthe spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house\r\nin Olney Court, where he would come with a large valise and perform\r\ncurious delvings in the cellar. He was always very liberal to her and\r\nto old Asa, but seemed more worried than he used to be; which grieved\r\nher very much, since she had watched him grow up from birth.\r\n\r\nAnother report of his doings came from Pawtuxet, where some friends\r\nof the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times. He\r\nseemed to haunt the resort and canoe-house of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet,\r\nand subsequent inquiries by Dr. Willett at that place brought out\r\nthe fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather\r\nhedged-in river-bank, along which he would walk toward the north,\r\nusually not reappearing for a very long while.\r\n\r\nLater in May came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the\r\nattic laboratory which brought a stern reproof from Mr. Ward and a\r\nsomewhat distracted promise of amendment from Charles. It occurred one\r\nmorning, and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation\r\nnoted on that turbulent Good Friday. The youth was arguing or\r\nremonstrating hotly with himself, for there suddenly burst forth a\r\nperfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated\r\ntones like alternate demands and denials, which caused Mrs. Ward to run\r\nupstairs and listen at the door. She could hear no more than a fragment\r\nwhose only plain words were \"must have it red for three months,\" and\r\nupon her knocking all sounds ceased at once. When Charles was later\r\nquestioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of\r\nspheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid, but which\r\nhe would try to transfer to other realms.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of June a queer nocturnal incident occurred. In the\r\nearly evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory\r\nupstairs, and Mr. Ward was on the point of investigating when it\r\nsuddenly quieted down. That midnight, after the family had retired, the\r\nbutler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement\r\nCharles appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of\r\nthe stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress.\r\nThe youth spoke no word, but the worthy Yorkshireman caught one sight\r\nof his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly. He opened the door and\r\nyoung Ward went out, but in the morning he presented his resignation to\r\nMrs. Ward. There was, he said, something unholy in the glance Charles\r\nhad fixed on him. It was no way for a young gentleman to look at an\r\nhonest person, and he could not possibly stay another night. Mrs. Ward\r\nallowed the man to depart, but she did not value his statement highly.\r\nTo fancy Charles in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous, for\r\nas long as she had remained awake she had heard faint sounds from the\r\nlaboratory above; sounds as if of sobbing and pacing, and of a sighing\r\nwhich told only of despair's profoundest depths. Mrs. Ward had grown\r\nused to listening for sounds in the night, for the mystery of her son\r\nwas fast driving all else from her mind.\r\n\r\nThe next evening, much as on another evening nearly three months\r\nbefore, Charles Ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally\r\nlost the main section. This matter was not recalled till later,\r\nwhen Dr. Willett began checking up loose ends and searching out\r\nmissing links here and there. In the _Journal_ office he found the\r\nsection which Charles had lost, and marked two items as of possible\r\nsignificance. They were as follows:\r\n\r\n                         More Cemetery Delving\r\n\r\n It was this morning discovered by Robert Hart, night watchman at the\r\n North Burial ground, that ghouls were again at work in the ancient\r\n portion of the cemetery. The grave of Ezra Weeden, who was born\r\n in 1740 and died in 1824 according to his uprooted and savagely\r\n splintered slate headstone, was found excavated and rifled, the work\r\n being evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent tool shed.\r\n\r\n    Whatever the contents may have been after more than a century of\r\n    burial, all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood. There\r\n    were no wheel tracks, but the police have measured a single set of\r\n    footprints which they found in the vicinity, and which indicate the\r\n    boots of a man of refinement.\r\n\r\n    Hart is inclined to link this incident with the digging\r\n    discovered last March, when a party in a motor truck were\r\n    frightened away after making a deep excavation; but Sergeant Riley\r\n    of the Second Station discounts this theory and points to vital\r\n    differences in the two cases. In March the digging had been in a\r\n    spot where no grave was known; but this time a well-marked and\r\n    cared-for grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate\r\n    purpose and with a conscious malignity expressed in the splintering\r\n    of the slab which had been intact up to the day before.\r\n\r\n    Members of the Weeden family, notified of the happening, expressed\r\n    their astonishment and regret; and were wholly unable to think of\r\n    any enemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor.\r\n    Hazard Weeden of 598 Angell Street recalls a family legend\r\n    according to which Ezra Weeden was involved in some very peculiar\r\n    circumstances, not dishonourable to himself, shortly before the\r\n    Revolution; but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly\r\n    ignorant. Inspector Cunningham has been assigned to the case, and\r\n    hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near future.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Dogs Noisy in Pawtuxet\r\n\r\n    Residents of Pawtuxet were aroused about three A.M. today by a\r\n    phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river\r\n    just north of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of\r\n    the howling were unusually odd, according to most who heard it;\r\n    and Fred Lemdin, night watchman at Rhodes, declares it was mixed\r\n    with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror\r\n    and agony. A sharp and very brief thunderstorm, which seemed to\r\n    strike somewhere near the bank of the river, put an end to the\r\n    disturbance. Strange and unpleasant odours, probably from the oil\r\n    tanks along the bay, are popularly linked with this incident; and\r\n    may have had their share in exciting the dogs.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of Charles now became very haggard and hunted, and all\r\nagree in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make\r\nsome statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him. The\r\nmorbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that\r\nhe made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness, and most of\r\nthe more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the\r\nrevolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported\r\nabout this time, but which have not yet been definitely traced to any\r\nknown perpetrator. These cases, too recent and celebrated to need\r\ndetailed mention, involved victims of every age and type and seemed\r\nto cluster around two distinct localities; the residential hill and\r\nthe North End, near the Ward home, and the suburban districts across\r\nthe Cranston line near Pawtuxet. Both late wayfarers and sleepers with\r\nopen windows were attacked, and those who lived to tell the tale spoke\r\nunanimously of a lean, lithe, leaping monster with burning eyes which\r\nfastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenously.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"These cases of Vampirism involved victims of every age\r\nand type.\"]\r\n\r\nDr. Willett, who refuses to date the madness of Charles Ward as far\r\nback as even this, is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors.\r\nHe has, he declares, certain theories of his own; and limits his\r\npositive statements to a peculiar kind of negation. \"I will not,\"\r\nhe says, \"state who or what I believe perpetrated these attacks and\r\nmurders, but I will declare that Charles Ward was innocent of them. I\r\nhave reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood, as indeed\r\nhis continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than\r\nany verbal argument. Ward meddled with terrible things, but he has paid\r\nfor it, and he was never a monster or a villain.\r\n\r\n\"As for now, I don't like to think. A change came, and I'm content to\r\nbelieve that the old Charles Ward died with it. His soul did, anyhow,\r\nfor that mad flesh that vanished from Waite's hospital had another.\"\r\n\r\nWillett speaks with authority, for he was often at the Ward home\r\nattending Mrs. Ward, whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain.\r\nHer nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which\r\nshe confided to the doctor with hesitancy, and which he ridiculed in\r\ntalking to her, although they made him ponder deeply when alone. These\r\ndelusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard\r\nin the attic laboratory and bedroom, and emphasized the occurrence\r\nof muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times. Early in\r\nJuly Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to Atlantic City for an indefinite\r\nrecuperative sojourn, and cautioned both Mr. Ward and the haggard and\r\nelusive Charles to write her only cheering letters. It is probably\r\nto this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and\r\ncontinued sanity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot long after his mother's departure Charles Ward began negotiating\r\nfor the Pawtuxet bungalow. It was a squalid little wooden edifice with\r\na concrete garage, perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the\r\nriver slightly above Rhodes, but for some odd reason the youth would\r\nhave nothing else. He gave the real-estate agencies no peace till one\r\nof them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat\r\nreluctant owner, and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under\r\ncover of darkness, transporting in a great closed van the entire\r\ncontents of his attic laboratory, including the books both weird and\r\nmodern which he had borrowed from his study. He had this van loaded in\r\nthe black small hours, and his father recalls only a drowsy realization\r\nof stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken\r\naway. After that Charles moved back to his own old quarters on the\r\nthird floor, and never haunted the attic again.\r\n\r\nTo the Pawtuxet bungalow Charles transferred all the secrecy with\r\nwhich he had surrounded his attic realm, save that he now appeared to\r\nhave two sharers of his mysteries; a villainous-looking Portuguese\r\nhalf-caste from the South Main Street Waterfront who acted as a\r\nservant, and a thin scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a\r\nstubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of\r\na colleague. Neighbors vainly tried to engage these odd persons in\r\nconversation. The mulatto, Gomes, spoke very little English, and the\r\nbearded man who gave his name as Dr. Allen voluntarily followed his\r\nexample. Ward himself tried to be more affable, but succeeded only in\r\nprovoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research.\r\nBefore long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night\r\nburning of lights; and somewhat later, after this burning had suddenly\r\nceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of\r\nmeat from the butcher's and of the muffled shouting, declamation,\r\nrhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some very deep\r\ncellar below the place. Most distinctly the new and strange household\r\nwas bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it\r\nis not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated\r\nestablishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and\r\nmurders; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined\r\nwholly to Pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of Edgewood.\r\n\r\nWard spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at\r\nhome and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his father's roof. Twice\r\nhe was absent from the city on week-long trips, whose destinations have\r\nnot yet been discovered. He grew steadily paler and more emaciated even\r\nthan before, and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating\r\nto Dr. Willett his old, old story of vital research and future\r\nrevelations. Willett often waylaid him at his father's house, for the\r\nelder Ward was deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to get\r\nas much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive\r\nand independent an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was\r\nsane even as late as this, and adduces many a conversation to prove his\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nAbout September the vampirism declined, but in the following January,\r\nWard almost became involved in serious trouble. For some time the\r\nnocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the Pawtuxet\r\nbungalow had been commented upon, and at this juncture an unforeseen\r\nhitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents. In a\r\nlonely spot near Hope Valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid\r\nwaylayings of trucks by \"hi-jackers\" in quest of liquor shipments,\r\nbut this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater\r\nshock. For the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain\r\nsome exceedingly gruesome things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter\r\ncould not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld. The\r\nthieves had hastily buried what they discovered, but when the State\r\nPolice got wind of the matter a careful search was made. A recently\r\narrested vagrant, under promise of immunity from prosecution on any\r\nadditional charge, at last consented to guide a party of troopers to\r\nthe spot; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and\r\nshameful thing. It would not be well for the national--or even the\r\ninternational--sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what\r\nwas uncovered by that awestruck party. There was no mistaking it, even\r\nby these far from studious officers; and telegrams to Washington ensued\r\nwith feverish rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow,\r\nand State and Federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and\r\nserious call. They found him pallid and worried with his two odd\r\ncompanions, and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation\r\nand evidence of innocence. He had needed certain anatomical specimens\r\nas part of a program of research whose depth and genuineness anyone\r\nwho had known him in the last decade could prove, and had ordered\r\nthe required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as\r\nreasonably legitimate as such things can be. Of the _identity_ of the\r\nspecimens he had known absolutely nothing, and was properly shocked\r\nwhen the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment\r\nand national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce. In\r\nthis statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague Dr.\r\nAllen, whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his\r\nown nervous tones; so that in the end the officials took no action,\r\nbut carefully set down the New York name and address which Ward gave\r\nthem as a basis for a search which came to nothing. It is only fair\r\nto add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their\r\nproper places, and that the general public will never know of their\r\nblasphemous disturbance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward\r\nwhich he considers of extraordinary importance, and about which he has\r\nfrequently quarreled with Dr. Lyman. Lyman believes that this note\r\ncontains positive proof of a well-developed case of _dementia praecox_,\r\nbut Willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane\r\nutterance of the hapless youth. He calls especial attention to the\r\nnormal character of the penmanship; which though shewing traces of\r\nshattered nerves, is nevertheless distinctly Ward's own. The text in\r\nfull is as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                      100 Prospect St.,\r\n                                                     Providence, R. I.,\r\n                                                         March 8, 1928.\r\n\r\n    Dear Dr. Willett--\r\n\r\n    I feel that at last the time has come for me to make the\r\n    disclosures which I have so long promised you, and for which you\r\n    have pressed me so often. The patience you have shewn in waiting,\r\n    and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and integrity, are\r\n    things I shall never cease to appreciate.\r\n\r\n    And now that I am ready to speak, I must own with humiliation\r\n    that no triumph such as I dreamed of can ever be mine. Instead\r\n    of triumph I have found terror, and my talk with you will not be\r\n    a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice in saving both\r\n    myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception\r\n    or calculation. You recall what those Fenner letters said of the\r\n    old raiding party at Pawtuxet. That must all be done again, and\r\n    quickly. Upon us depends more than can be put into words--all\r\n    civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar\r\n    system and the universe. I have brought to light a monstrous\r\n    abnormality, but I did it for the sake of knowledge. Now for the\r\n    sake of all life and nature you must help me thrust it back into\r\n    the dark again.\r\n\r\n    I have left that Pawtuxet place forever, and we must extirpate\r\n    everything existing there, alive or dead. I shall not go there\r\n    again, and you must not believe it if you ever hear that I am\r\n    there. I will tell you why I say this when I see you. I have come\r\n    home for good, and wish you would call on me at the very first\r\n    moment that you can spare five or six hours continuously to hear\r\n    what I have to say. It will take that long--and believe me when I\r\n    tell you that you never had a more genuine professional duty than\r\n    this. My life and reason are the very least things which hang in\r\n    the balance.\r\n\r\n    I dare not tell my father, for he could not grasp the whole thing.\r\n    But I have told him of my danger, and he has four men from a\r\n    detective agency watching the house. I don't know how much good\r\n    they can do, for they have against them forces which even you could\r\n    scarcely envisage or acknowledge. So come quickly if you wish to\r\n    see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from\r\n    stark hell.\r\n\r\n    Any time will do--I shall not be out of the house. Don't telephone\r\n    ahead, for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept\r\n    you. And let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may\r\n    prevent this meeting.\r\n\r\n    In utmost gravity and desperation,\r\n\r\n                                                   Charles Dexter Ward.\r\n\r\n    P. S.--Shoot Dr. Allen on sight _and dissolve his body in acid.\r\n    Don't burn it._\r\n\r\nDr. Willett received this note about ten-thirty a.m., and immediately\r\narranged to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the\r\nmomentous talk, letting it extend on into the night as long as might\r\nbe necessary. He planned to arrive about four o'clock, and through\r\nall the intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild\r\nspeculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically performed.\r\nManiacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger, Willett had\r\nseen too much of Charles Ward's oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving.\r\nThat something very subtle, ancient, and horrible was hovering about\r\nhe felt quite sure, and the reference to Dr. Allen could almost be\r\ncomprehended in view of what Pawtuxet gossip said of Ward's enigmatical\r\ncolleague. Willett had never seen the man, but had heard much of his\r\naspect and bearing, and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those\r\nmuch-discussed dark glasses might conceal.\r\n\r\nPromptly at four Dr. Willett presented himself at the Ward residence,\r\nbut found to his annoyance that Charles had not adhered to his\r\ndetermination to remain indoors. The guards were there, but said that\r\nthe young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity. He had that\r\nmorning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over\r\nthe telephone, one of the detectives said, replying to some unknown\r\nvoice with phrases such as \"I am very tired and must rest awhile,\"\r\n\"I can't receive anyone for some time, you'll have to excuse me,\"\r\n\"Please postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of\r\ncompromise,\" or \"I am very sorry, but I must take a complete vacation\r\nfrom everything; I'll talk with you later.\" Then, apparently gaining\r\nboldness through meditation, he had slipped out so quietly that no one\r\nhad seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about\r\none o'clock and entered the house without a word. He had gone upstairs,\r\nwhere a bit of his fear must have surged back; for he was heard to cry\r\nout in a high terrified fashion upon entering his library, afterward\r\ntrailing off into a kind of choking gasp. When, however, the butler had\r\ngone to inquire what the trouble was, he had appeared at the door with\r\na great show of boldness, and had silently gestured the man away in a\r\nmanner that terrified him unaccountably. Then he had evidently done\r\nsome rearranging of his shelves, for a great clattering and thumping\r\nand creaking ensued; after which he had reappeared and left at once.\r\nWillett inquired whether or not any message had been left, but was\r\ntold that there was none. The butler seemed queerly disturbed about\r\nsomething in Charles' appearance and manner, and asked solicitously if\r\nthere was much hope for a cure of his disordered nerves.\r\n\r\nFor almost two hours Dr. Willett waited vainly in Charles Ward's\r\nlibrary, watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books\r\nhad been removed, and smiling grimly at the paneled overmantel on\r\nthe north wall, whence a year before the suave features of old Joseph\r\nCurwen had looked mildly down. After a time the shadows began to\r\ngather, and the sunset cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which\r\nflew shadow-like before the night. Mr. Ward finally arrived, and showed\r\nmuch surprise and anger at his son's absence after all the pains which\r\nhad been taken to guard him. He had not known of Charles' appointment,\r\nand promised to notify Willett when the youth returned. In bidding\r\nthe doctor good night he expressed his utter perplexity at his son's\r\ncondition, and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy\r\nto normal poise. Willett was glad to escape from that library, for\r\nsomething frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it; as if the vanished\r\npicture had left behind a legacy of evil. He had never liked that\r\npicture; and even now, strong-nerved though he was, there lurked a\r\nquality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get\r\nout into the pure air as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning Willett received a message from the senior Ward,\r\nsaying that Charles was still absent. Mr. Ward mentioned that Dr.\r\nAllen had telephoned him to say that Charles would remain at Pawtuxet\r\nfor some time, and that he must not be disturbed. This was necessary\r\nbecause Allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite\r\nperiod, leaving the researches in need of Charles' constant oversight.\r\nCharles sent his best wishes, and regretted any bother his abrupt\r\nchange of plans might have caused. In listening to this message Mr.\r\nWard heard Dr. Allen's voice for the first time, and it seemed to\r\nexcite some vague and elusive memory which could not be actually\r\nplaced, but which was disturbing to the point of fearfulness.\r\n\r\nFaced by these baffling and contradictory reports, Dr. Willett was\r\nfrankly at a loss what to do. The frantic earnestness of Charles'\r\nnote was not to be denied, yet what could one think of its writer's\r\nimmediate violation of his own expressed policy? Young Ward had written\r\nthat his delvings had become blasphemous and menacing, that they and\r\nhis bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost, and that he\r\nhimself would never return to their final scene; yet according to\r\nlatest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick\r\nof the mystery. Common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his\r\nfreakishness, yet some deeper instinct would not permit the impression\r\nof that frenzied letter to subside. Willett read it over again, and\r\ncould not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its\r\nbombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply.\r\nIts terror was too profound and real, and in conjunction with what\r\nthe doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from\r\nbeyond time and space, to permit of any cynical explanation. There were\r\nnameless horrors abroad; and no matter how little one might be able to\r\nget at them, one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nFor over a week Dr. Willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust\r\nupon him, and became more and more inclined to pay Charles a call at\r\nthe Pawtuxet bungalow. No friend of the youth had ever ventured to\r\nstorm this forbidden retreat, and even his father knew of its interior\r\nonly from such descriptions as he chose to give; but Willett felt that\r\nsome direct conversation with his patient was necessary. Mr. Ward had\r\nbeen receiving brief and non-committal typed notes from his son, and\r\nsaid that Mrs. Ward in her Atlantic City retirement had had no better\r\nword. So at length the doctor resolved to act; and despite a curious\r\nsensation inspired by old legends of Joseph Curwen, and by more recent\r\nrevelations and warnings from Charles Ward, set boldly out for the\r\nbungalow on the bluff above the river.\r\n\r\nWillett had visited the spot before through sheer curiosity, though of\r\ncourse never entering the house or proclaiming his presence; hence knew\r\nexactly the route to take. Driving out Broad Street one early afternoon\r\ntoward the end of February in his small motor, he thought oddly of the\r\ngrim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fifty-seven\r\nyears before, on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehend.\r\n\r\nThe ride through the city's decaying fringe was short, and trim\r\nEdgewood and sleepy Pawtuxet presently spread out ahead. Willett turned\r\nto the right down Lockwood Street and drove his car as far along that\r\nrural road as he could, then alighted and walked north to where the\r\nbluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of\r\nmisty downlands beyond. Houses were still few here, and there was no\r\nmistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high\r\npoint of land at his left. Stepping briskly up the neglected gravel\r\nwalk he rapped at the door with a firm hand, and spoke without a tremor\r\nto the evil Portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack.\r\n\r\nHe must, he said, see Charles Ward at once on vitally important\r\nbusiness. No excuse would be accepted, and a repulse would mean only\r\na full report of the matter to the elder Ward. The mulatto still\r\nhesitated, and pushed against the door when Willett attempted to open\r\nit; but the doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands.\r\nThen there came from the dark interior a husky whisper which somehow\r\nchilled the hearer through and through, though he did not know why he\r\nfeared it. \"Let him in, Tony,\" it said, \"we may as well talk now as\r\never.\" But disturbing as was the whisper, the greater fear was that\r\nwhich immediately followed. The floor creaked and the speaker hove in\r\nsight--and the owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be\r\nno other than Charles Dexter Ward.\r\n\r\nThe minuteness with which Dr. Willett recalled and recorded his\r\nconversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns\r\nto this particular period. For at last he concedes a vital change in\r\nCharles Dexter Ward's mentality, and believes that the youth now spoke\r\nfrom a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched\r\nfor six and twenty years. Controversy with Dr. Lyman has compelled him\r\nto be very specific, and he definitely dates the madness of Charles\r\nWard from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents.\r\nThose notes are not in Ward's normal style; not even in the style of\r\nthat last frantic letter to Willett. Instead, they are strange and\r\narchaic, as if the snapping of the writer's mind had released a flood\r\nof tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood\r\nantiquarianism. There is an obvious effort to be modern, but the spirit\r\nand occasionally the language are those of the past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe past, too, was evident in Ward's every tone and gesture as he\r\nreceived the doctor in that shadowy bungalow. He bowed, motioned\r\nWillett to a seat, and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper\r\nwhich he sought to explain at the very outset.\r\n\r\n\"I am grown phthisical,\" he began, \"from this cursed river air. You\r\nmust excuse my speech. I suppose you are come from my father to see\r\nwhat ails me, and I hope you will say nothing to alarm him.\"\r\n\r\nWillett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care, but\r\nstudying even more closely the face of the speaker. Something, he felt,\r\nwas wrong; and he thought of what the family had told him about the\r\nfright of that Yorkshire butler one night. He wished it were not so\r\ndark, but did not request that any blind be opened. Instead, he merely\r\nasked Ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a\r\nweek before.\r\n\r\n\"I was coming to that,\" the host replied. \"You must know, I am in a\r\nvery bad state of nerves, and do and say queer things I cannot account\r\nfor. As I have told you often, I am on the edge of great matters; and\r\nthe bigness of them has a way of making me light-headed. Any man might\r\nwell be frighted of what I have found, but I am not to be put off for\r\nlong. I was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home; for having\r\ngone this far, my place is here. I am not well spoke of by my prying\r\nneighbors, and perhaps I was led by weakness to believe myself what\r\nthey say of me. There is no evil to any in what I do, so long as I do\r\nit rightly. Have the goodness to wait six months, and I'll show you\r\nwhat will pay your patience well.\r\n\r\n\"You may as well know I have a way of learning old matters from things\r\nsurer than books, and I'll leave you to judge the importance of what I\r\ncan give to history, philosophy, and the arts by reason of the doors\r\nI have access to. My ancestor had all this when those witless peeping\r\nToms came and murdered him. I now have it again, or am coming very\r\nimperfectly to have a part of it. This time nothing must happen, and\r\nleast of all through any idiot fears of my own. Pray forget all I writ\r\nyou, Sir, and have no fear of this place or any in it. Dr. Allen is a\r\nman of fine parts, and I owe him an apology for anything ill I have\r\nsaid of him. I wish I had no need to spare him, but there were things\r\nhe had to do elsewhere. His zeal is equal to mine in all those matters,\r\nand I suppose that when I feared the work I feared him too as my\r\ngreatest helper in it.\"\r\n\r\nWard paused, and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think. He felt\r\nalmost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter;\r\nand yet there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse\r\nwas strange and alien and indubitably mad, the note itself had been\r\ntragic in its naturalness and likeness to the Charles Ward he knew.\r\nWillett now tried to turn the talk on early matters, and recall to the\r\nyouth some past events which would restore a familiar mood; but in\r\nthis process he obtained only the most grotesque results. It was the\r\nsame with all the alienists later on. Important sections of Charles\r\nWard's store of mental images, mainly those touching modern times and\r\nhis own personal life, had been unaccountably expunged; while all the\r\nmassed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound\r\nsubconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual. The\r\nyouth's ultimate knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy, and\r\nhe tried his best to hide it. When Willett would mention some favorite\r\nobject of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed by pure accident\r\nsuch a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to\r\npossess, and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided by.\r\n\r\nIt was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriff's\r\nwig fell off as he leaned over at the play in Mr. Douglass' Histrionick\r\nAcademy in King Street on the eleventh of February, 1762, which fell of\r\na Thursday; or about how the actors cut the text of Steele's \"Conscious\r\nLover\" so badly that one was almost glad the Baptist-ridden legislature\r\nclosed the theater a fortnight later. That Thomas Sabin's Boston coach\r\nwas \"damn'd uncomfortable\" old letters may well have told; but what\r\nhealthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of Epenetus Olney's\r\nnew signboard (the gaudy Crown he set up after he took to calling his\r\ntavern the Crown Coffee House) was exactly like the first few notes of\r\nthe new jazz piece all the radios in Pawtuxet were playing?\r\n\r\nWard, however, would not be quizzed long in this vein. Modern and\r\npersonal topics he waved aside quite summarily, whilst regarding\r\nantique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom. What he wished\r\nclearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him\r\ndepart without the intention of returning. To this end he offered to\r\nshew Willett the entire house, and at once proceeded to lead the doctor\r\nthrough every room from cellar to attic. Willett looked sharply, but\r\nnoted that the visible books were far too few and trivial ever to have\r\nfilled the wide gaps on Ward's shelves at home, and that the meager\r\nso-called \"laboratory\" was the flimsiest sort of a blind. Clearly,\r\nthere were a library and a laboratory elsewhere; but just where, it\r\nwas impossible to say. Essentially defeated in his quest for something\r\nhe could not name, Willett returned to town before evening and told\r\nthe senior Ward everything which had occurred. They agreed that the\r\nyouth must be definitely out of his mind, but decided that nothing\r\ndrastic need be done just then. Above all, Mrs. Ward must be kept in as\r\ncomplete an ignorance as her son's own strange typed notes would permit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Ward now determined to call in person upon his son, making it\r\nwholly a surprise visit. Dr. Willett took him in his car one evening,\r\nguiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for\r\nhis return. The session was a long one, and the father emerged in a\r\nvery saddened and perplexed state. His reception had developed much\r\nlike Willett's, save that Charles had been an excessively long time\r\nin appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and\r\nsent the Portuguese away with an imperative demand; and in the bearing\r\nof the altered son there was no trace of filial affection. The lights\r\nhad been dim, yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled\r\nhim outrageously. He had not spoke out loud at all, averring that his\r\nthroat was in a very poor condition; but in his hoarse whisper there\r\nwas a quality so vaguely disturbing that Mr. Ward could not banish it\r\nfrom his mind.\r\n\r\nNow definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youth's\r\nmental salvation, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett set about collecting\r\nevery scrap of data which the case might afford. Pawtuxet gossip was\r\nthe first item they studied, and this was relatively easy to glean\r\nsince both had friends in that region. Dr. Willett obtained the most\r\nrumors because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of\r\nthe central figure, and from all he heard he could tell that young\r\nWard's life had become indeed a strange one. Common tongues would\r\nnot dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous\r\nsummer, while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks\r\nprovided their share of dark speculation. Local tradesmen spoke of\r\nthe queerness of the orders brought them by the evil-looking mulatto,\r\nand in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood\r\nsecured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighborhood. For a\r\nhousehold of only three, these quantities were quite absurd.\r\n\r\nThen there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth. Reports of\r\nthese things were harder to pin down, but all the vague hints tallied\r\nin certain basic essentials. Noises of a ritual nature positively\r\nexisted, and at times when the bungalow was dark. They might, of\r\ncourse, have come from the known cellar; but rumor insisted that there\r\nwere deeper and more spreading crypts. Recalling the ancient tales of\r\nJoseph Curwen's catacombs, and assuming for granted that the present\r\nbungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old Curwen\r\nsite as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the\r\npicture, Willett and Mr. Ward gave this phase of the gossip much\r\nattention; and searched many times without success for the door in the\r\nriver bank which old manuscripts mentioned. As to popular opinions of\r\nthe bungalow's various inhabitants, it was soon plain that the Brava\r\nPortuguese was loathed, the bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen feared,\r\nand the pallid young scholar disliked to a profound extent. During\r\nthe last week or two Ward had obviously changed much, abandoning his\r\nattempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent\r\nwhispers on the few occasions that he ventured forth.\r\n\r\nSuch were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there; and over\r\nthese Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett held many long and serious conferences.\r\nThey strove to exercise deduction, induction, and constructive\r\nimagination to their utmost extent; and to correlate every known fact\r\nof Charles' later life, including the frantic letter which the doctor\r\nnow shewed the father, with the meager documentary evidence available\r\nconcerning old Joseph Curwen. They would have given much for a glimpse\r\nof the papers Charles had found, for very clearly the key to the\r\nyouth's madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and\r\nhis doings.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, after all, it was from no step of Mr. Ward's or Dr. Willett's\r\nthat the next move in this singular case proceeded. The father and\r\nthe physician, rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and\r\nintangible to combat, had rested uneasily on their oars while the\r\ntyped notes of young Ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer. Then\r\ncame the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments,\r\nand the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and\r\ntelephoning from one to the other. Officials who knew Charles Ward\r\nby sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his\r\nappearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery, and were reassured\r\nless than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained\r\nthat his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as\r\nto make normal writing impossible. He could, he said, form no written\r\ncharacters at all except with great difficulty; and could prove it by\r\nthe fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters, even\r\nthose to his father and mother, who would bear out the assertion.\r\n\r\nWhat made the investigators pause in confusion was not this\r\ncircumstance alone, for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally\r\nsuspicious; nor even the Pawtuxet gossip, of which one or two of them\r\nhad caught echoes. It was the muddled discourse of the young man\r\nwhich nonplussed them, implying as it did a virtually total loss of\r\nmemory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his\r\nfingertips only a month or two before. Something was wrong; for despite\r\nthe apparent coherence and rationality of his speech, there could be\r\nno normal reason for this ill-concealed blankness on vital points.\r\nMoreover, although none of these men knew Ward well, they could not\r\nhelp observing the change in his language and manner. They had heard\r\nhe was an antiquarian, but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not\r\nmake daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures. Altogether, this\r\ncombination of hoarseness, palsied hands, bad memory, and altered\r\nspeech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine\r\ngravity, which, no doubt, formed the basis of the prevailing odd\r\nrumors; and after their departure the party of officials decided that a\r\ntalk with the senior Ward was imperative.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo on the sixth of March, 1928, there was a long and serious conference\r\nin Mr. Ward's office, after which the utterly bewildered father\r\nsummoned Dr. Willett in a kind of helpless resignation. Willett looked\r\nover the strained and awkward signatures of the cheques, and compared\r\nthem in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note.\r\nCertainly, the change was radical and profound, and yet there was\r\nsomething damnably familiar about the new writing. It had crabbed and\r\narchaic tendencies of a very curious sort, and seemed to result from a\r\ntype of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always\r\nused. It was strange--but where had he seen it before? On the whole, it\r\nwas obvious that Charles was insane. Of that there could be no doubt.\r\nAnd since it appeared unlikely that he could handle his property or\r\ncontinue to deal with the outside world much longer, something must\r\nquickly be done toward his oversight and possible cure. It was then\r\nthat the alienists were called in, Drs. Peck and Waite of Providence\r\nand Dr. Lyman of Boston, to whom Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett gave the most\r\nexhaustive possible history of the case, and who conferred at length\r\nin the now unused library of their young patient, examining what books\r\nand papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of\r\nhis habitual mental cast. After scanning this material and examining\r\nthe meaningless note to Willett, they all agreed that Charles Ward's\r\nstudies had been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary\r\nintellect, and wished most heartily that they could see his more\r\nintimate volumes and documents; but this latter they knew they could\r\ndo, if at all, only after a scene at the bungalow itself. Willett now\r\nreviewed the whole case with febrile energy; it being at this time that\r\nhe obtained the statements of the workmen who had seen Charles find the\r\nCurwen documents, and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed\r\nnewspaper items, looking up the latter at the _Journal_ office.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman and Waite,\r\naccompanied by Mr. Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making\r\nno concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged\r\npatient with extreme minuteness. Charles, though he was ordinately\r\nlong in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange\r\nand noxious laboratory odors when he did finally make his agitated\r\nappearance, proved a far from recalcitrant subject; and admitted\r\nfreely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close\r\napplication to abstruse studies. He offered no resistance when his\r\nremoval to other quarters was insisted upon; and seemed, indeed, to\r\ndisplay a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory. His\r\nconduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not\r\nthe persistently archaic trend of his speech and the unmistakable\r\nreplacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked\r\nhim out as one definitely removed from the normal. Of his work he\r\nwould say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to\r\nhis family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous\r\nmonth he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that the\r\nshadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible\r\nones, and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of\r\nsuch odors as now saturated all his clothing. Neighborhood gossip he\r\nattributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled\r\ncuriosity. Of the whereabouts of Dr. Allen he said he did not feel\r\nat liberty to speak definitely, but assured his inquisitors that the\r\nbearded and spectacled man would return when needed. In paying off\r\nthe stolid Brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors, and in\r\nclosing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets,\r\nWard shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to\r\npause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently\r\nanimated by a calmly philosophic resignation, as if his removal were\r\nthe merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if\r\nfacilitated and disposed of once and for all. It was clear that he\r\ntrusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to\r\novercome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory, his\r\nlost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and eccentric behavior\r\nhad led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told of the\r\nchange; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to\r\nthe restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained\r\nby Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to the\r\nclosest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected\r\nwith the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed;\r\nthe slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and the disproportionate\r\nneural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the various\r\nexaminers, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate\r\nwith terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganization. Even\r\nthe familiar olive-mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a\r\ngreat black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before, and\r\nwhich made Willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any\r\nof the \"witch markings\" reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome\r\nnocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places. The doctor could not keep\r\nhis mind off a certain transcribed witch-trial record from Salem which\r\nCharles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days, and which read:\r\n\"Mr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S.,\r\nJonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable\r\nC., and Deborah B.\" Ward's face, too, troubled him horribly, till at\r\nlength he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. Above the young\r\nman's right eye was something which he had never previously noticed--a\r\nsmall scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of\r\nold Joseph Curwen, and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic\r\ninoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their\r\noccult careers.\r\n\r\nWhile Ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital, a very\r\nstrict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to Dr.\r\nAllen, which Mr. Ward had ordered delivered at the family home. Willett\r\nhad predicted that very little would be found, since any communications\r\nof a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger; but\r\nin the latter part of March there did come a letter from Prague for Dr.\r\nAllen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought. It was in\r\na very crabbed and archaic hand; and though clearly not the effort of a\r\nforeigner, shewed almost as singular a departure from modern English as\r\nthe speech of young Ward himself. It read:\r\n\r\n                                                       Kleinstrasse 11,\r\n                                                      Altstadt, Prague,\r\n                                                       11th Feby. 1928.\r\n\r\n    Brother in Almousin-Metraton!--\r\n\r\n    I this day receiv'd yr mention of what came up from the Salts I\r\n    sent you. It was wrong, and meanes clearly that ye Headstones had\r\n    been chang'd when Barnabas gott me the Specimen. It is often so,\r\n    as you must be sensible of from the Thing you gott from ye King's\r\n    Chapell ground in 1769 and what H. gott from Olde Bury'g Point in\r\n    1690, that was like to ende him. I gott such a Thing in Aegypt 75\r\n    yeares gone, from the which came that Scar ye Boy saw on me here\r\n    in 1924. As I told you longe ago, do not calle up That which you\r\n    can not put downe; either from dead Saltes or out of ye Spheres\r\n    beyond. Have ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp\r\n    not to be sure when there is any Doubte of _Whom_ you have. Stones\r\n    are all chang'd now in Nine groundes out of 10. You are never sure\r\n    till you question. I this day heard from H., who has had Trouble\r\n    with the Soldiers. He is like to be sorry Transylvania is pass'd\r\n    from Hungary to Roumania, and wou'd change his Seat if the Castel\r\n    weren't so fulle of What we Knowe. But of this he hath doubtless\r\n    writ you. In my next Send'g there will be Somewhat from a Hill\r\n    tomb from ye East that will delight you greatly. Meanwhile forget\r\n    not I am desirous of B. F. if you can possibly get him for me. You\r\n    know G. in Philadelphia better than I. Have him up firste if you\r\n    will, but doe not use him soe hard he will be Difficult, for I must\r\n    speake to him in ye Ende.\r\n\r\n                                                Yogg-Sothoth Neblod Zin\r\n                                                               Simon O.\r\n\r\n    To Mr. J. C. in\r\n    Providence.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward and Dr. Willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent\r\nbit of unrelieved insanity. Only by degrees did they absorb what it\r\nseemed to imply. So the absent Dr. Allen, and not Charles Ward, had\r\ncome to be the leading spirit at Pawtuxet? That must explain the wild\r\nreference and denunciation in the youth's last frantic letter. And\r\nwhat of this addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as \"Mr.\r\nJ. C.?\" There was no escaping the inference, but there are limits to\r\npossible monstrosity. Who was \"Simon O.\"; the old man Ward had visited\r\nin Prague four years previously? Perhaps, but in the centuries behind\r\nthere had been another Simon O.--Simon Orne, alias Jedediah, of Salem,\r\nwho vanished in 1771, _and whose peculiar handwriting Dr. Willett\r\nnow unmistakably recognized from the photostatic copies of the Orne\r\nformulae which Charles had once shewn him_. What horrors and mysteries,\r\nwhat contradictions and contraventions of nature, had come back after a\r\ncentury and a half to harass Old Providence with her clustered spires\r\nand domes?\r\n\r\nThe father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or\r\nthink, went to see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as\r\ndelicately as they could about Dr. Allen, and the Prague visit, and\r\nabout what he had learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all\r\nthese inquiries the youth was politely non-committal, merely barking\r\nin his hoarse whisper that he had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable\r\nspiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and that any\r\ncorrespondent that the bearded man might have in Prague would probably\r\nbe similarly gifted. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realized\r\nto their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism;\r\nand that without imparting anything vital himself, the confined youth\r\nhad adroitly pumped them of everything the Prague letter had contained.\r\n\r\nDrs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much\r\nimportance to the strange correspondence of young Ward's companion; for\r\nthey knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band\r\ntogether, and believed that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an\r\nexpatriated counterpart--perhaps one who had seen Orne's handwriting\r\nand copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone character's\r\nreincarnation. Allen himself was perhaps a similar case, and may have\r\npersuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead\r\nCurwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the\r\nhard-headed doctors disposed of Willett's growing disquiet about\r\nCharles Ward's present handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated\r\nspecimens obtained by various ruses. Willett thought he had placed its\r\nodd familiarity at last, and that what it vaguely resembled was the\r\nbygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself; but this the other\r\nphysicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected\r\nin a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any importance\r\neither favorable or unfavorable. Recognizing this prosaic attitude\r\nin his colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the\r\nletter which arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rakus,\r\nTransylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that\r\nof the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe\r\nbefore breaking the seal. This read as follows:\r\n\r\n                                                       Castle Ferenczy,\r\n                                                          7 March 1928.\r\n\r\n    Dear C.--\r\n\r\n    Hadd a Squd of 20 Militia up to talk about what the Country Folk\r\n    say. Must digg deeper and have less Hearde. These Roumanians\r\n    plague one damnably, being officious and particular where you\r\n    cou'd buy a Magyar off with a Drinke and food. Last Monthe M. got\r\n    me ye sarcophagus of ye Five Sphinxes from ye Acropolis where He\r\n    whome I call'd up say'd it wou'd be, and I have hadde 3 Talkes\r\n    _with What was therein inhum'd_. It will go to S. O. in Prague\r\n    directly, and thence to you. It is stubborn but you know ye Way\r\n    with Such. You shew Wisdom in having lesse about than Before;\r\n    for there was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eat'g off\r\n    their Heades, and it made much to be founde in case of Trouble, as\r\n    you too welle know. You can now move and Worke elsewhere with no\r\n    Kill'g Trouble if nedful, though I hope no Thing will soon force\r\n    you to so Bothersome a Course. I rejoice that you traffick not so\r\n    much with _Those Outside_; for there was ever a Mortall Peril in\r\n    it, and you are sensible what it did when you asked Protection of\r\n    One not dispos'd to give it. You excel me in gett'g ye formulae\r\n    so _another_ may saye them with Success, but Borellus fancy'd it\r\n    wou'd be so if just ye right Wordes were hadd. Does ye Boy use 'em\r\n    often? I regret that he growes squeamish, as I fear'd he wou'd when\r\n    I hadde him here nigh fiften Monthes, but am sensible you knowe how\r\n    to deal with him. You can't saye him down with ye Formula, for that\r\n    will Worke only upon such as ye other Formula hath call'd up from\r\n    Saltes; but you still have strong Handes and Knife and Pistol, and\r\n    Graves are not harde to digg, nor Acids loth to burne. O. sayes\r\n    you have promis'd him B. F. I must have him after. B. goes to you\r\n    soone, and may he give you what you wishe of that Darke Thing\r\n    belowe Memphis. Imploy care in what you calle up, and beware of ye\r\n    Boy. It will be ripe in a yeare's time to have up ye Legions from\r\n    Underneath, and then there are no Boundes to what shal be oures.\r\n    Have Confidence in what I saye, for you knowe O. and I have hadd\r\n    these 150 yeares more than you to consulte these Matters in.\r\n\r\n                                                  Nephreu--Ka nai Hadoh\r\n                                                                Edw: H.\r\n\r\n    For J. Curwen, Esq.\r\n    Providence.\r\n\r\nBut if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to\r\nthe alienists, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves.\r\nNo amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the\r\nstrangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charles' frantic\r\nletter had spoken as such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister\r\ncorrespondence with two inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited\r\nin his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of\r\nCurwen's old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the\r\nreincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertained--or was at\r\nleast advised to entertain--murderous designs against a \"boy\" who could\r\nscarcely be other than Charles Ward. There was organized horror afoot;\r\nand no matter who had started it, the missing Allen was by this time\r\nat the bottom of it. Therefore, thanking Heaven that Charles was now\r\nsafe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no time in engaging detectives to\r\nlearn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor; finding whence he\r\nhad come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible discovering\r\nhis current whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow\r\nkeys which Charles had yielded up, he urged them to explore Allen's\r\nvacant room which had been identified when the patient's belongings had\r\nbeen packed; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might\r\nhave left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his son's old\r\nlibrary, and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last; for\r\nthere seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil. Perhaps it\r\nwas what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had\r\nonce stared from the paneled overmantel, and perhaps it was something\r\ndifferent and irrelevant; but in any case they all half-sensed an\r\nintangible miasma which centered in that carven vestige of an older\r\ndwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material\r\nemanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _5. A Nightmare and a Cataclysm_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its\r\nindelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and\r\nhas added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then\r\nfar behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had\r\ncome to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the\r\nalienists would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement\r\nalive in the world, whose direct connection with a necromancy even\r\nolder than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least\r\ntwo living men--and one other of whom they dared not think--were in\r\nabsolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as\r\nearly as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in\r\nthe face of all known natural laws. What these horrible creatures--and\r\nCharles Ward as well--were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear\r\nfrom their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which\r\nhad filtered in upon the case. They were robbing the tombs of all the\r\nages, including those of the world's wisest and greatest men, in the\r\nhope of recovering from bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness\r\nand lore which had once animated and informed them.\r\n\r\nA hideous traffic was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby\r\nillustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of\r\nschoolboys swapping books; and from what was extorted from this\r\ncenturied dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond\r\nanything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or\r\ngroup. They had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either\r\nin the same body or different bodies; and had evidently achieved a way\r\nof tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together.\r\nThere had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when\r\nhe wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain\r\n\"Essential Saltes\" from which the shade of a long-dead living thing\r\nmight be raised up. There was a formula for evoking such a shade, and\r\nanother for putting it down; and it had now been so perfected that it\r\ncould be taught successfully. One must be careful about evocations, for\r\nthe markers of old graves are not always accurate.\r\n\r\nWillett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to\r\nconclusion. Things--presences or voices of some sort--could be drawn\r\ndown from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process\r\nalso one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many\r\nforbidden things, and as for Charles--what might one think of him?\r\nWhat forces \"outside the spheres\" had reached him from Joseph Curwen's\r\nday and turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find\r\ncertain directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man\r\nof horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains\r\nof Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at\r\nlast. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night\r\nwere too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and\r\nit must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those\r\n_different_ tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they\r\nlike, with their depth and hollowness? Was there not here some awful\r\nforeshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass?\r\nYes, _that_ was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single\r\ntalk with the man--if man it were--over the telephone!\r\n\r\nWhat hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence,\r\nhad come to answer Charles Ward's secret rites behind that locked\r\ndoor? Those voices heard in argument--\"must have it red for three\r\nmonths\"--Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out?\r\nThe rifling of Ezra Weeden's ancient grave, and the cries later at\r\nPawtuxet--whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the\r\nshunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the\r\nbearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of\r\nCharles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they\r\ndid feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again\r\nand was following its ancient morbidities. Was demoniac possession\r\nin truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the\r\ndetectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the\r\nyoung man's life. In the meantime, since the existence of some vast\r\ncrypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute, some\r\neffort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, conscious of\r\nthe sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final\r\nconference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled\r\nthoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following\r\nmorning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to\r\narchitectural search and underground exploration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe morning of April sixth dawned clear, and both explorers were at the\r\nbungalow by ten o'clock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory\r\nsurvey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allen's room it\r\nwas obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later\r\nsearchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of\r\nvalue. Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they\r\ndescended without much delay, again making the circuit which each had\r\nvainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner. For a time\r\neverything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone\r\nwalls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a\r\nyawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that\r\nsince the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs\r\nbeneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly\r\nmodern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed\r\nfor the ancient vaults whose rumor could have reached them by no\r\nwholesome means.\r\n\r\nThe doctor tried to put himself in Charles' place and see how a delver\r\nwould be likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this\r\nmethod. Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully\r\nover the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal,\r\ntrying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially\r\nnarrowed down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform\r\nbefore the washtubs, which he had tried once before in vain. Now\r\nexperimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength,\r\nhe finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally\r\non a corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron\r\nman-hole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal. The\r\ncover was not hard to lift, and the father had quite removed it when\r\nWillett noticed the queerness of his aspect. He was swaying and nodding\r\ndizzily, and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black\r\npit beneath the doctor soon recognized ample cause.\r\n\r\nIn a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above\r\nand was reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it\r\ncould be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way\r\ngravely sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out\r\nto Broad Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home\r\ndespite his weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric\r\ntorch, covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze, and descended\r\nonce more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul air had now\r\nslightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the\r\nStygian hole. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical\r\ndrop with concrete walls and an iron ladder; after which the hole\r\nappeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally\r\nhave emerged to earth somewhat southward of the present building.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWillett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen\r\nlegends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf.\r\nHe could not help thinking of what Luke Fenner had reported on that\r\nlast monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge,\r\ncarrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might\r\nprove of supreme importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years,\r\nhe descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below. This was\r\nancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping walls he\r\nsaw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not\r\nspirally, but in three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two\r\nmen could have passed only with difficulty. He had counted about thirty\r\nwhen a sound reached him very faintly; and after that he did not feel\r\ndisposed to count any more.\r\n\r\nIt was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages\r\nof nature which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a\r\ndoom-dragged whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and\r\nstricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential\r\nloathesomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for this that\r\nWard had seemed to listen on that day he was removed? It was the most\r\nshocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and it continued from\r\nno determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps\r\nand cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by\r\nCyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways. The hall\r\nin which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of\r\nthe vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large\r\nchipped flagstones, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its\r\nlength he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into\r\nthe blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-paneled\r\ncolonial type, whilst others had none.\r\n\r\nOvercoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett\r\nbegan to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them\r\nrooms with groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently\r\nof bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of\r\nwhose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering.\r\nNever before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions\r\nof instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying\r\ndust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases evidently\r\nshattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers\r\nseemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the\r\nearliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwen's experimentation.\r\nFinally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent\r\noccupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and\r\ncabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and\r\ncontemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several\r\nplaces; and finding a match safe handy, Willett lighted such as were\r\nready for use.\r\n\r\nIn the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less\r\nthan the latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the\r\ndoctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had\r\nplainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was\r\na piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became\r\nso great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both\r\nof which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the\r\nsteps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize\r\nany papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those\r\nportentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture\r\nin Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the\r\nfinal unraveling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers\r\nin curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even\r\nyears might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he\r\nfound large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in\r\nwriting clearly recognizable as Orne's and Hutchinson's; all of which\r\nhe took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.\r\n\r\nAt last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home,\r\nWillett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognizing them from\r\nthe reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The\r\nyouth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when\r\nfirst he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were\r\npresent except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the\r\ncipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and\r\ncontinued his examination of the files. Since young Ward's immediate\r\ncondition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was\r\ndone among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of\r\ncontemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. That oddity\r\nwas the slight amount in Charles' normal writing, which indeed included\r\nnothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there\r\nwere literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and\r\nphilosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical\r\nwith the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern\r\ndating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day program had been a sedulous\r\nimitation of the old wizard's writing, which Charles seemed to have\r\ncarried to a marvelous state of perfection. Of any third hand which\r\nmight have been Allen's there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to\r\nbe the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis.\r\n\r\nIn this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae,\r\nrecurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half\r\nfinished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand\r\none surmounted by the archaic symbol called \"Dragon's Head\" and used\r\nin almanacs to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one\r\nheaded by the corresponding sign of \"Dragon's Tail\" or descending\r\nnode. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost\r\nunconsciously the doctor realized that the second half was no more\r\nthan the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the\r\nfinal monosyllables and of the odd name _Yog-Sothoth_, which he had\r\ncome to recognize under various spellings from other things he had\r\nseen in connection with this horrible matter. The formulae were as\r\nfollows--_exactly_ so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify--and\r\nthe first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his\r\nbrain, which he recognized later when reviewing the events of that\r\nhorrible Good Friday of the previous year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Y'AI 'NG'NGAH,\r\n    _YOG-SOTHOTH_\r\n    H'EE----L'GEB\r\n    F'AI THRODOG\r\n    _UAAAH_\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    OGTHROD AI'F\r\n    GEB'L----EE'H\r\n    _YOG-SOTHOTH_\r\n    'NGAH'NG AI'Y\r\n    _ZHRO_\r\n]\r\n\r\nSo haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon\r\nthem, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his\r\nbreath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he\r\ncould digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no\r\nmore till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ample\r\nand more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory,\r\nso leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the\r\nblack noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull\r\nand hideous whine.\r\n\r\nThe next few rooms he tried were all abandoned or filled only with\r\ncrumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him\r\ndeeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwen's original operations. He\r\nthought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of the graves\r\nwhich had been violated in every part of the world, and of what\r\nthat final raiding party must have seen; and then he decided it was\r\nbetter not to think any more. Once a great stone staircase mounted at\r\nhis right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the\r\nCurwen outbuildings--perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high\r\nslitlike windows--provided the steps he had descended had led from the\r\nsteep-roofed farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead,\r\nand the stench and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had\r\ncome upon a vast open space, so great that his torchlight would not\r\ncarry across it; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout\r\npillars supporting the arches of the roof.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths\r\nof Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in\r\nthe center; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he\r\napproached to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what\r\nthey were he shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate\r\nthe dark stains which discolored the upper surface and had spread down\r\nthe sides in occasional thin lines. Instead, he found the distant wall\r\nand traced it as it swept around in a gigantic circle perforated by\r\noccasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells\r\nwith iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the\r\nstone of the concave rear masonry. These cells were empty, but still\r\nthe horrible odor and the dismal moaning continued, more insistent\r\nnow than ever, and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery\r\nthumping.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willett's attention\r\ncould no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the\r\ngreat pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression\r\nof being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene\r\nmystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading\r\nfurther down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged\r\nfloor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there\r\nwould occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite\r\narrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly\r\nflung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a\r\nparticularly large amount of the frightful odor which encompassed\r\neverything. As he walked slowly about, it suddenly occurred to Willett\r\nthat both the noise and the odor seemed strongest directly above the\r\noddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down\r\nto some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it\r\nwith his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge\r\nit. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only\r\nwith vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy\r\nstone. A stench unnamable now rose from below, and the doctor's head\r\nreeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the\r\nexposed square yard of gaping blackness.\r\n\r\nIf he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate\r\nabomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst\r\nthat foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced\r\ntop of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and\r\ndevoid of any ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone\r\ndown, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in\r\nconjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile\r\nscrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even\r\nto imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss; but in\r\na moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink;\r\nlying at full length and holding the torch downward at arm's length to\r\nsee what might lie below. For a second he could distinguish nothing\r\nbut the slimy, moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that\r\nhalf-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy; and\r\nthen he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically\r\nup and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have been\r\nfrom twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay.\r\nThe torch shook in his hand, but he looked again to see what manner\r\nof living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that\r\nunnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all the long month\r\nsince the doctors had taken him away, and clearly only one of a vast\r\nnumber prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so\r\nthickly studded the floor of the great vaulted cavern. Whatever the\r\nthings were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must\r\nhave crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous\r\nweeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded.\r\n\r\nBut Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for\r\nsurgeon and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not\r\nbeen the same since. It is hard to explain just how a single sight of\r\na tangible object with measurable dimensions could so shake and change\r\na man; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and\r\nentities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully\r\non a sensitive thinker's perspective and whispers terrible hints\r\nof obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the\r\nprotective illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett\r\nsaw such an outline or entity, for during the next few instants he was\r\nundoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waite's private hospital.\r\nHe dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or\r\nnervous coordination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which\r\ntold of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed\r\nand screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his\r\nwould ever have recognized, and though he could not rise to his feet he\r\ncrawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens\r\nof Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping\r\nto answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose\r\nstones, and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars,\r\nbut still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the\r\nutter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning\r\nwail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was drenched\r\nwith perspiration and without means of producing a light; stricken and\r\nunnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory\r\nhe never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived,\r\nand from one of the shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he\r\nhad seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the\r\nthought that some obscure foothold might exist.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the\r\ncarvings on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made\r\nit in this form, for it was too palpably _unfinished_. The deficiencies\r\nwere of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion\r\ncould not be described. Willett consents only to say that this type\r\nof thing must have represented entities which Ward called up from\r\n_imperfect salts_, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic\r\npurposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not\r\nhave been carved on that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing\r\ndepicted on that stone--but Willett never opened the other pits. At the\r\ntime, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from\r\nsome of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used\r\nby Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the\r\nbygone sorcerer:\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, there was Noth'g butt ye liveliest Awfullness in That which\r\nH. rais'd upp from What he cou'd gather onlie a Part of.\"\r\n\r\nThen, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there\r\ncame a recollection of those ancient lingering rumors anent the burned\r\nand twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid.\r\nCharles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that\r\nobject; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any\r\nanimal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.\r\n\r\nThese words hummed in the doctor's mind as he rocked to and fro,\r\nsquatting on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out,\r\nand repeated the Lord's Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off\r\ninto a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic \"Waste Land\" of Mr.\r\nT. S. Eliot and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula\r\nhe had lately found in Ward's underground library: \"_Y'ai 'ng-'ngah,\r\nYog-Sothoth_,\" and so on till the final underlined \"_Zhro_.\" It seemed\r\nto soothe him and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting\r\nbitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam\r\nof light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would\r\nnot; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint\r\nor reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library.\r\nAfter awhile he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely\r\nfar away, and toward this he crawled in agonized caution on hands and\r\nknees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he\r\ncollide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable\r\npit he had uncovered.\r\n\r\nOnce his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the\r\nsteps leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled\r\nin loathing. At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had\r\nremoved, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not\r\ncome upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from\r\nthat aperture to detain him. What had been down there made no sound\r\nnor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not\r\nbeen good for it. Each time Willett's fingers felt a perforated slab\r\nhe trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning\r\nbelow, but generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved\r\nvery noiselessly. Several times during his progress the glow ahead\r\ndiminished perceptibly, and he realized that the various candles and\r\nlamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being\r\nlost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of\r\nnightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run, which he\r\ncould safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew that\r\nonce the light failed his only hope of rescue and survival would lie\r\nin whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a\r\nsufficient period.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower\r\ncorridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his\r\nright. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in\r\nyoung Ward's secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the\r\nsputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an\r\noil supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright\r\nagain he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further\r\nexploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of\r\ngrim purpose was still uppermost, and he was firmly determined to\r\nleave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind\r\nCharles Ward's bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chose\r\nthe smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with\r\ncandles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which\r\nhe proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he\r\nmight uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and\r\nnameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his\r\nutmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the\r\nfrightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented\r\nwall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious archways\r\nwould form the next goals of a logical search.\r\n\r\nSo Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and\r\nanguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse\r\nof the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone\r\nslab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small\r\nchambers, some vacant and some evidently used as store rooms; and\r\nin several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of\r\nvarious objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales\r\nof spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was\r\nunmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another\r\nroom he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual\r\nprovisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what\r\nhe disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally\r\nappeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked\r\nthem even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose ruins\r\nretained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odors\r\nperceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When\r\nhe had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found\r\nanother corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which\r\nmany doors opened.\r\n\r\nThis he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of\r\nmedium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large\r\noblong apartment whose businesslike tanks and tables, furnaces and\r\nmodern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and\r\nbottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles\r\nWard--and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.\r\n\r\nAfter lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr.\r\nWillett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest\r\ninterest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on\r\nthe shelves that young Ward's dominant concern must have been with some\r\nbranch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from\r\nthe scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting\r\ntable; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the\r\nbooks was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was\r\nweirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage\r\nwhose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwen's farmhouse\r\nmore than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course,\r\nmust have perished along with the rest of Curwen's occult library in\r\nthe final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these\r\nthe doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he\r\nsaw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed\r\nwith care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage\r\nand shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he\r\ncould decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms,\r\nand several new and tightly-nailed boxes which he did not stop to\r\ninvestigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which\r\nhe judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwen's laboratory appliances.\r\nThese had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still\r\npartly recognizable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with\r\nshelves and having in the center a table bearing two lamps. These\r\nlamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless\r\nshelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly\r\nvacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking\r\nleaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles like a\r\nGrecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and\r\nproportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were\r\ncovered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a\r\nmoment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great\r\nrigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large\r\nwooden sign reading \"Custodes\" above them, and all the Phalerons on\r\nthe other, correspondingly labeled with a sign reading \"Materia.\" Each\r\nof the jars or jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out\r\nto be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring\r\nto a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently.\r\nFor the moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the\r\narray as a whole; and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi\r\nand Phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalization. The\r\nresult was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity\r\nof a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light\r\nweight and of many shades of dull neutral color. To the colors which\r\nformed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of\r\ndisposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and\r\nwhat occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-gray powder might be by the\r\nside of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a Phaleron might have its\r\nexact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual feature about\r\nthe powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into\r\nhis hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue\r\nwhatever remained on his palm.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this\r\nbattery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass\r\njars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \"Custodes,\" \"Materia\";\r\nthat was the Latin for \"Guards\" and \"Material,\" respectively--and\r\nthen there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word\r\n\"Guards\" before in connection with this dreadful mystery. It was, of\r\ncourse, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old\r\nEdward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \"There was no Neede to keep\r\nthe Guards in shape and eat'g off their Heades, and it made much to\r\nbe founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle Knowe.\" What did this\r\nsignify? But wait--was there not still _another_ reference to \"guards\"\r\nin this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the\r\nHutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him\r\nof the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden\r\non the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been\r\na mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook\r\nhimself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden\r\ninsisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives\r\nof his, _and the guards of those captives_. Those guards, according to\r\nHutchinson or his avatar, had \"eaten their heads off,\" so that now Dr.\r\nAllen did not keep them _in shape_. And if not _in shape_, how save\r\nas the \"salts\" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in\r\nreducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could?\r\n\r\nSo _that_ was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of\r\nunhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission\r\nas to help when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defense\r\nof their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so\r\nwilling? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring\r\nin and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in\r\npanic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps\r\nwatching sentinels. Then he thought of the \"Materia\"--in the myriad\r\nPhaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too--and if not the\r\nsalts of \"guards,\" then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible\r\nthat here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the\r\nages; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought\r\nthem safe, and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to\r\ndrain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect\r\nwould concern, as poor Charles had hinted in his frantic note, \"all\r\ncivilization, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar\r\nsystem and the universe?\" And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their\r\ndust through his hands!\r\n\r\nThen he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room, and calmed\r\nhimself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiseled\r\nabove. It was only a symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual\r\ndread; for a morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper\r\nand told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep.\r\nIt was the sign of Koth, that dreamers see fixed above the archway\r\nof a certain black tower standing alone in twilight--and Willett did\r\nnot like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But\r\na moment later he forgot the sign as he recognized a new acrid odor\r\nin the stench-filled air. This was a chemical rather than animal\r\nsmell, and came clearly from the room beyond the door. And it was,\r\nunmistakably, the same odor which had saturated Charles Ward's clothing\r\non the day the doctors had taken him away. So it was here that the\r\nyouth had been interrupted by the final summons? He was wiser than old\r\nJoseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, boldly determined to\r\npenetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain,\r\nseized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of nameless\r\nfright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred\r\nto no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he would\r\nnot be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his\r\npatient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture\r\nsave a table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with\r\nclamps and wheels which Willett recognized after a moment as medieval\r\ninstruments of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage\r\nwhips, above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow\r\npedestaled cups of lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side\r\nwas the table; with a powerful Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and\r\ntwo of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at\r\nirregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted the\r\nlamp and looked carefully at the pad to see what notes young Ward\r\nmight have been jotting down when interrupted; but found nothing more\r\nintelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed\r\nCurwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:\r\n\r\n\"B. dy'd not. Escap'd into walls and founde Place below.\r\n\r\n\"Saw olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt ye Way.\r\n\r\n\"Rais'd _Yog-Sothoth_ thrice and was ye nexte Day deliver'd.\r\n\r\n\"F. soughte to wipe out all know'g howe to raise Those from Outside.\"\r\n\r\nAs the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw\r\nthat the wall opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing\r\nappliances in the corners, was covered with pegs from which hung a set\r\nof shapeless looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But\r\nfar more interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were\r\nthickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiseled in\r\nthe smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also bore marks of carving;\r\nand with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in\r\nthe center, with a plain circle about three feet wide halfway between\r\nthis and each corner. In one of these four circles, near where a\r\nyellowish robe had been flung carelessly down, there stood a shallow\r\nkylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack; and just\r\noutside the periphery was one of the Phaleron jugs from the shelves in\r\nthe other room, its tag numbered 118. This was unstoppered, and proved\r\nupon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw with a shiver that\r\nthe kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering\r\nonly by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small\r\namount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have\r\nbelonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that\r\ncame sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several\r\nelements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of\r\ntorture; the dust or salts from the jug of \"Materia,\" the two lekythoi\r\nfrom the \"Custodes\" shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the\r\nnotes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand\r\nglimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the\r\nfriends and parents of Charles Ward--all these engulfed the doctor in a\r\ntidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread\r\nin the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor.\r\n\r\nWith an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began\r\nstudying the formulae chiseled on the walls. From the stained and\r\nincrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph\r\nCurwen's time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to\r\none who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the\r\nhistory of magic. One the doctor clearly recognized as what Mrs. Ward\r\nheard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before,\r\nand what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation\r\naddressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not\r\nspelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor\r\nyet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of\r\n\"Eliphas Levi\"; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as\r\n_Sabaoth_, _Metraton_, _Almonsin_, and _Zariatnatmik_ sent a shudder\r\nof fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic\r\nabomination just around the corner.\r\n\r\nThis was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand\r\nwall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of\r\nrecognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently\r\noccurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly\r\nspeaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \"Dragon's Head\" and\r\n\"Dragon's Tail\" heading them as in Ward's scribblings. But the spelling\r\ndiffered quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old\r\nCurwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study\r\nhad evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in\r\nquestion. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiseled version with the\r\none which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do.\r\nWhere the script he had memorized began \"_Y'ai 'Ng'ngah, Yog-Sothoth_,\"\r\nthis epigraph started out as \"_Aye, cngengah, Yogge-Sothotha_\"; which\r\nto his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the\r\nsecond word.\r\n\r\nGround as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy\r\ndisturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae\r\naloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters\r\nhe found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy\r\nrang his voice! its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through\r\nthe spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example\r\nof that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose\r\nand fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and darkness.\r\n\r\n    \"Y'AI 'NG'NGAH\r\n    _YOG-SOTHOTH_\r\n    H'EE----L'GEB\r\n    F'AI' THRODOG\r\n    _UAAH_!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very\r\noutset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the\r\ngloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from\r\nsight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odor which quite drowned out\r\nthe stench from the far-away wells; an odor like that he had smelt\r\nbefore, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the\r\ninscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw\r\nthat the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder\r\nhad lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapor of\r\nsurprising volume and opacity. That powder--Great God! it had come from\r\nthe shelf of \"Materia\"--what was it doing now, and what had started it?\r\nThe formula he had been chanting--the first of the pair--Dragon's Head,\r\n_ascending node_--Blessed Saviour, could it be--\r\n\r\nThe doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps\r\nfrom all he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph\r\nCurwen and Charles Dexter Ward. \"I say to you againe, doe not call up\r\nAny that you cannot put downe.... Have ye Wordes for laying at all\r\ntimes readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of\r\n_Whom_ you have--Three Talkes with _What_ was therein inhum'd--\" _Mercy\r\nof Heaven, what is that shape behind the parting smoke?_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMarinus Bicknell Willett has no hope that any part of his tale will\r\nbe believed except by certain sympathetic friends, hence has made\r\nno attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few\r\noutsiders have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh\r\nand remark that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised\r\nto take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental\r\ndisturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only\r\na horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the\r\nbungalow cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at\r\neleven o'clock that portentous morning? Did he not telephone the doctor\r\nin vain that evening, and again the next day, and had he not driven\r\nto the bungalow itself on that following noon, finding his friend\r\nunconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs? Willett had been\r\nbreathing stertorously, and opened his eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave\r\nhim some brandy fetched from the car. Then he shuddered and screamed,\r\ncrying out, \"_That beard--those eyes--God, who are you?_\" A very\r\nstrange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman whom\r\nhe had known from the latter's boyhood.\r\n\r\nIn the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the\r\nprevious morning. Willett's clothing bore no disarrangement beyond\r\ncertain smudges and worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid\r\nodor reminded Mr. Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was\r\ntaken to the hospital. The doctor's flashlight was missing, but his\r\nvalise was safely there, as empty as when he had brought it. Before\r\nindulging in any explanations, and obviously with great moral effort,\r\nWillett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful\r\nplatform before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had\r\nleft his yet-unused tool satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel\r\nand began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one. Underneath the\r\nsmooth concrete was still visible, but of any opening or perforation\r\nthere was no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to sicken the\r\nmystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs; only the\r\nsmooth concrete underneath the planks--no noisome well, no world of\r\nsubterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare\r\npits of stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiseled\r\nformulae, no--Dr. Willett turned pale, and clutched at the younger man.\r\n\"Yesterday,\" he asked softly, \"did you see it here--and smell it?\" And\r\nwhen Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength\r\nto nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half\r\na gasp, and nodded in turn. \"Then I will tell you,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSo for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the\r\nphysician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There\r\nwas nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the\r\ngreenish-black vapor from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired\r\nto ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered\r\nhead-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed\r\nsuggestion, \"Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?\" The doctor\r\nwas silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer\r\nwhen powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side\r\nof the Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, \"But where did it go? It\r\nbrought you here, you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Willett again let silence answer for him.\r\n\r\nBut after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for\r\nhis handkerchief before rising to leave, Dr. Willett's fingers closed\r\nupon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before,\r\nand which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in\r\nthe vanished vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the\r\ncheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and\r\nthe writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencil--doubtless\r\nthe one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very carelessly,\r\nand beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print\r\nor mark of any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed\r\nreek with wonder; for here was no script of any wholesome age, but the\r\nlabored strokes of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the laymen\r\nwho now strained over it, yet having combinations of symbols which\r\nseemed vaguely familiar. The briefly scrawled message was this, and its\r\nmystery lent purpose to the shaken pair, who forthwith walked steadily\r\nout to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet\r\ndining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and\r\nover these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out\r\nfrom the great chandelier. In the end they found what was needed. The\r\nletters were indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script of\r\na very dark period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the\r\neighth or ninth century A. D., and brought with them memories of an\r\nuncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer ancient faiths and\r\nancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked\r\nsometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins at Caerleon and Hexhaus,\r\nand by the Towers along Hadrian's crumbling wall. The words were in\r\nsuch Latin as a barbarous age might remember--\"_Corvinus, necandus est.\r\nCadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d retinendum. Tace ut\r\npotes._\"--which may roughly be translated, \"Curwen must be killed. The\r\nbody must be dissolved in aqua fortis, nor must anything be retained.\r\nKeep silence as best you are able.\"\r\n\r\nWillett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown,\r\nand found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely\r\nbelieved they ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for\r\nreceiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both\r\nmen sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them\r\nto leave. Then they drove listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect\r\nStreet, and talked to no purpose into the night. The doctor rested\r\ntoward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday\r\nnoon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been\r\nassigned to look up Dr. Allen.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered\r\nthe call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when\r\nhe heard their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad\r\nthat this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin\r\nof the strange minuscule message, it seemed certain that the \"Curwen\"\r\nwho must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled\r\nstranger. Charles had feared this man, and had said in the frantic note\r\nthat he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, moreover, had been\r\nreceiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name\r\nof Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone\r\nnecromancer. And now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message\r\nsaying that \"Curwen\" must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage\r\nwas too unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not Allen\r\nplanning to murder young Ward upon the advice of the creature called\r\nHutchinson? Of course, the letter they had seen had never reached\r\nthe bearded stranger; but from its text they could see that Allen\r\nhad already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too\r\n\"squeamish.\" Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even if the\r\nmost drastic directions were not carried out, he must be placed where\r\nhe could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of\r\ninformation anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one\r\ncapable of giving it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and\r\ncalled on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett\r\ntold him all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each\r\ndescription made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician\r\nemployed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a\r\nwincing on Charles' part when he approached the matter of the covered\r\npits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett\r\npaused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were\r\nstarving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity, and shivered\r\nwhen only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped\r\nas useless his pretense that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see\r\nsome ghastly jest in this affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something\r\nwhich amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible\r\nbecause of the cracked voice he used, \"Damn 'em, they _do_ eat, but\r\nthey _don't_ need to! That's the rare part! A month, you say, without\r\nfood? Lud, Sir, you be modest! D'ye know, that was the joke on poor old\r\nWhipple with his virtuous bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why,\r\ndamme, he was half-deaf with the noise from Outside and never saw or\r\nheard aught from the wells. He never dreamed they were there at all!\r\nDevil take ye, _those cursed things have been howling down there ever\r\nsince Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone_!\"\r\n\r\nBut no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet\r\nalmost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope\r\nthat some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure\r\nhe maintained. Looking at the youth's face, the doctor could not but\r\nfeel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought.\r\nTruly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the\r\nroom with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles\r\nshewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his\r\nface as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured\r\nthe mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no possible\r\nsignificance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic.\r\n\"But,\" he added, \"had you but known the words to bring up that which I\r\nhad out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. 'Twas Number\r\n118, and I conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my\r\nlist in t'other room. 'Twas never raised by me, but I meant to have it\r\nup that day you came to invite me hither.\"\r\n\r\nThen Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the\r\ngreenish-black smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true\r\nfear dawn for the first time on Charles Ward's face. \"It _came_, and\r\nyou be here alive!\" As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost\r\nto burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny\r\nresonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he\r\nsaw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he\r\nremembered. \"No. 118, you say? But don't forget that _stones are all\r\nchanged now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you\r\nquestion!_\" And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule\r\nmessage and flashed it before the patient's eyes. He could have wished\r\nno stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest\r\nsecrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician\r\nof encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett\r\nand Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch.\r\nIn reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must\r\nget to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed\r\nfully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at\r\nleast one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his\r\nassassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before\r\nit was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look\r\nof a hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and\r\nthe father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the\r\nbearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual\r\nwas very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he\r\nwished.\r\n\r\nThis was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They\r\ndid not worry about any communications Charles might write to that\r\nmonstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities\r\nseized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or\r\noutré-looking missive.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and\r\nHutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague\r\npresentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with\r\nan international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current\r\ncrimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after\r\nsix months believed that he had found two very significant things\r\namongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One\r\nwas the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of\r\nPrague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadeh,\r\nwho had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other\r\nwas a titan explosion in the Transylvania mountains east of Rakus, and\r\nthe utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle\r\nFerenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery\r\nalike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious\r\nquestioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as\r\nto antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which\r\nwrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and\r\nthat while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able\r\nto find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate\r\nmay have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to\r\nbe present when the detectives arrived. Allen's destruction or\r\nimprisonment--or Curwen's, if one might regard the tacit claim to\r\nreincarnation as valid--he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and\r\nhe communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the\r\nmen to come. They were downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the\r\nhouse were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness\r\nwhich hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older servants\r\nconnected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock the three detectives presented themselves and\r\nimmediately delivered all that they had to say. They had not,\r\nregrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished,\r\nnor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allen's source or present\r\nwhereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of\r\nlocal impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger. Allen\r\nhad struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being and there was\r\nan universal belief that his thick Vandyke beard was either dyed or\r\nfalse--a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false\r\nbeard, together with a heavy pair of dark glasses, in his room at the\r\nfateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his one\r\ntelephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be\r\nforgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and\r\nhorn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had\r\nseen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and\r\ncrabbed; this being confirmed by penciled notes of no clear meaning\r\nfound in his room and identified by the merchant.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the vampirism ructions of the preceding summer, a\r\nmajority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the\r\nactual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who\r\nhad visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor\r\ntruck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had\r\nrecognized him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage. The\r\nplace had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would\r\nknow him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they\r\nthought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As\r\nfor the search of Allen's room, it yielded nothing definite save the\r\nbeard and glasses, and several penciled notes in a crabbed writing,\r\nwhich Willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old\r\nCurwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young Ward\r\nfound in the vanished catacombs of horror.\r\n\r\nDr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and\r\ninsidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded,\r\nand almost trembled in following up the vague, mad thought which had\r\nsimultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses, the\r\ncrabbed Curwen penmanship--the old portrait and its tiny scar--_and\r\nthe altered youth in the hospital with such a scar_--that deep, hollow\r\nvoice on the telephone--was it not of this that Mr. Ward was reminded\r\nwhen his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed\r\nto be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, some\r\nofficials had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that\r\nCharles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at\r\nthe bungalow? Curwen--Allen--Ward--in what blasphemous and abominable\r\nfusion had two ages and two persons become involved? That damnable\r\nresemblance of the picture to Charles--had it not used to stare and\r\nstare, and follow the boy around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did\r\nboth Allen and Charles copy Joseph Curwen's handwriting, even when\r\nalone and off guard? And then the frightful work of those people--the\r\nlost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight; the starved\r\nmonsters in the noisome pits; the awful formula which had yielded such\r\nnameless results; the message in minuscules found in Willett's pocket;\r\nthe papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and \"salts\" and\r\ndiscoveries--whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the\r\nmost sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realization of why he\r\ndid it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet\r\nshopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a\r\nphotograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink\r\nthe pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard, which the men\r\nhad brought from Allen's room.\r\n\r\nFor two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where\r\nfear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the\r\nupstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned.\r\nYes, _the altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr.\r\nAllen_. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened\r\nbrow with his handkerchief. Allen--Ward--Curwen--it was becoming too\r\nhideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void,\r\nand what had it done to him? What really had happened from first to\r\nlast? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too \"squeamish,\"\r\nand why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic\r\nletter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too,\r\nhad the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said\r\nthat \"Curwen\" must be likewise obliterated? What was the _change_,\r\nand when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note\r\nwas received--he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an\r\nalteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the\r\nmen hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no--had\r\nhe not cried out in terror as he entered his study--this very room?\r\nWhat had he found there? Or wait--_what had found him?_ That simulacrum\r\nwhich brushed boldly in without having been seen to go--was that an\r\nalien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which\r\nhad never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWillett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It\r\nhad, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises--a cry,\r\na gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping,\r\nor all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out\r\nwithout a word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the\r\nheavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had\r\nsettled definitely upon the house, and only the businesslike detectives\r\nfailed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for\r\nthis case had held vague elements in the background which pleased\r\nthem not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his\r\nthoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into\r\nmuttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly\r\nconclusive chain of nightmare happenings.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone\r\nsave him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as\r\nof coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett\r\nbegan talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a\r\ngreat deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he\r\npredicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better\r\nthan a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and\r\nthe first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the\r\nabandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered\r\nabout itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph\r\nCurwen's features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel.\r\n\r\nMr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably\r\nmaddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could\r\nonly acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the\r\nshunned room with the paneling from Olney Court. The father, listening\r\noutside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments\r\npassed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door\r\nwere being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting\r\nchoke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at\r\nonce the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and\r\nghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall\r\nof the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log\r\nhad little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions,\r\nMr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine\r\nlogs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place\r\nthem in the grate. Willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled\r\nlaboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the\r\nmoving of the July before. They were in a covered basket, and Mr. Ward\r\nnever saw what they were.\r\n\r\nThen the doctor locked himself up in the library once more, and by the\r\nclouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it\r\nwas known that he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling\r\nof newspapers, that odd wrench and creaking were heard again; followed\r\nby a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two\r\nsuppressed cries of Willett's were heard, and hard upon these came a\r\nswishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the\r\nwind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid, and everyone\r\nwished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous\r\ninundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Ward's head reeled, and the servants\r\nall clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke\r\nswoop down. After an age of waiting the vapors seemed to lighten, and\r\nhalf-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor operations\r\nwere heard behind the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming\r\nof some cupboard within, Willett made his appearance, sad, pale and\r\nhaggard, and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken from the\r\nupstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, and into that once\r\naccursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with\r\na queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still\r\nlingered; but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and\r\nstately in its white paneling as if it had never borne the picture of\r\nJoseph Curwen. Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held\r\nno latent fright, but only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done\r\nthe doctor would never speak. To Mr. Ward he said, \"I can answer no\r\nquestions, but I will say that there are different kinds of magic. I\r\nhave made a great purgation. Those in this house will sleep the better\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat Dr. Willett's \"purgation\" had been an ordeal almost as\r\nnerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt\r\nis shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely\r\nas soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested\r\nconstantly in his room, though servants later muttered something\r\nabout having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer\r\ndoor softly opened, and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants'\r\nimaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been\r\nexcited by an item in Thursday's _Evening Bulletin_ which ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                     North End Ghouls Again Active\r\n\r\n    After a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the\r\n    Weeden lot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was\r\n    glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart,\r\n    the night watchman. Happening to glance for a moment from his\r\n    shelter at about two a.m., Hart observed a glow of a lantern or\r\n    pocket torch not far to the northward, and upon opening the door\r\n    detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted\r\n    against a nearby electric light. At once starting in pursuit, he\r\n    saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance, gaining\r\n    the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or\r\n    capture was possible.\r\n\r\n    Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this\r\n    intruder had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part\r\n    of the Ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but\r\n    nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted, and no\r\n    previous grave had been disturbed.\r\n\r\n    Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man\r\n    probably having a full beard, inclines to the view that all three\r\n    of the digging incidents have a common source; but police from the\r\n    Second Station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of\r\n    the second incident, where an ancient coffin was removed and its\r\n    headstone violently shattered.\r\n\r\n    The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to\r\n    bury something was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and\r\n    has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible,\r\n    says Sergeant Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature.\r\n    Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture\r\n    the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.\r\n\r\nAll day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something\r\npast or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote\r\na note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which\r\ncaused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward\r\nhad not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday\r\nwith its baffling reports and its sinister \"purgation,\" but he found\r\nsomething calming about the doctor's letter in spite of the despair it\r\nseemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke.\r\n\r\n                                                         10 Barnes St.,\r\n                                                     Providence, R. I.,\r\n                                                        April 12, 1928.\r\n\r\n    Dear Theodore:\r\n\r\n    I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going\r\n    to do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been\r\n    going through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach\r\n    that monstrous place we know of), but I'm afraid it won't set your\r\n    mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very conclusive it\r\n    is.\r\n\r\n    You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you\r\n    will not distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left\r\n    undecided and unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further\r\n    speculation as to Charles's case, and almost imperative that you\r\n    tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects. When I call\r\n    on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That is all which need\r\n    remain in anyone's mind. He was mad, and he escaped.\r\n\r\n    So don't ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something\r\n    will go wrong, but I'll tell you if it does. I don't think it will.\r\n    There will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be\r\n    very, very safe. He is now--safer than you dream. You need hold\r\n    no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a\r\n    part of the past as Joseph Curwen's picture, and when I ring your\r\n    doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person. And\r\n    what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yours.\r\n\r\n    But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to\r\n    do the same. I must tell you frankly that Charles's escape will not\r\n    mean his restoration to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar\r\n    disease, as you must realize from the subtle physical as well as\r\n    mental changes in him, and you must not hope to see him again. He\r\n    stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know, and reached back\r\n    through the years as no one ever should reach; and something came\r\n    out of those years to engulf him.\r\n\r\n    And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most\r\n    of all. For there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charles's\r\n    fate. In about a year, say, you can if you wish devise a suitable\r\n    account of the end, for the boy will be no more. You can put up a\r\n    stone in your lot at the North Burial ground exactly ten feet west\r\n    of your father's and facing the same way, and that will mark the\r\n    true resting-place of your son. Nor need you fear that it will\r\n    mark any abnormality or changeling. The ashes in that grave will\r\n    be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew--of the real Charles\r\n    Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from infancy--the real Charles\r\n    with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark\r\n    on his chest or the pit on his forehead. The Charles who never\r\n    did actual evil, and who will have paid with his life for his\r\n    \"squeamishness.\"\r\n\r\n    That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can\r\n    put up his stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the\r\n    honour of your ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been\r\n    at all times in the past.\r\n\r\n    With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness,\r\n    and resignation, I am ever\r\n\r\n                                                 Sincerely your friend,\r\n                                                    Marinus B. Willett.\r\n\r\nSo on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett\r\nvisited the room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waite's private\r\nhospital on Conanicut Island. After the interchange of a few strained\r\nformalities, a new element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to\r\nread behind the doctor's masklike face a terrible purpose which had\r\nnever been there before.\r\n\r\nWard actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak.\r\n\"More,\" he said, \"has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a\r\nreckoning is due.\"\r\n\r\n\"Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?\" was the\r\nironic reply. It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Willett slowly rejoined, \"this time I did not have to dig. We\r\nhave had men looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and\r\nspectacles in the bungalow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent,\" commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily\r\ninsulting, \"and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and\r\nglasses you now have on!\"\r\n\r\n\"They would become you very well,\" came the even and studied response,\r\n\"_as indeed they seem to have done_.\"\r\n\r\nAs Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over\r\nthe sun; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then\r\nWard ventured:\r\n\r\n\"And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does\r\nfind it now and then useful to be twofold?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Willett gravely, \"again you are wrong. It is no business of\r\nmine if any man seeks duality; _provided he has any right to exist at\r\nall, and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space_.\"\r\n\r\nWard now started violently. \"Well, Sir, what _have_ ye found, and what\r\nd'ye want with me?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his\r\nwords for an effective answer.\r\n\r\n\"I have found,\" he finally intoned, \"something in a cupboard behind an\r\nancient overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and\r\nburied the ashes where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.\"\r\n\r\nThe madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been\r\nsitting:\r\n\r\n\"Damn ye, who did ye tell--and who'll believe it was he after these\r\nfull two months, with me alive? What d'ye mean to do?\"\r\n\r\nWillett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial\r\nmajesty as he calmed the patient with a gesture.\r\n\r\n\"I have told no one. This is no common case--it is a madness out of\r\ntime and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers\r\nor courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with. _You cannot\r\ndeceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know that your accursed magic is true!_\r\n\r\n\"I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and\r\nfastened on your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into\r\nthe past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I\r\nknow how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern\r\nthings and roved abroad as a vampire by night, and how you later\r\nshewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your\r\ngodless likeness to him; I know what you resolved to do when he balked\r\nat your monstrous rifling of the world's tombs, _and at what you\r\nplanned afterward_, and I know how you did it.\r\n\r\n\"You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around\r\nthe house. They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it\r\nwas he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him. But you\r\nhadn't reckoned on the different contacts of two minds. You were a\r\nfool, Curwen, to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough.\r\nWhy didn't you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting?\r\nIt hasn't worked, you see, after all. You know better than I who or\r\nwhat wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not\r\nwritten in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be\r\nstamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend\r\nto Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, 'do not\r\ncall up any that you cannot put down.' Curwen, a man can't tamper with\r\nNature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise\r\nup to wipe you out.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature\r\nbefore him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show\r\nof physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctor's\r\nrescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a\r\nseries of cabalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow\r\nvoice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening\r\nwords of a terrible formula.\r\n\r\n\"PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON....\"\r\n\r\nBut Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside\r\nbegan to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the\r\nbay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that\r\nwhich he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye--magic for\r\nmagic--let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had\r\nbeen learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the\r\n_second_ of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of\r\nthose minuscules--the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragon's\r\nTail, sign of the _descending_ node--\r\n\r\n    \"OGTHROD AI'F\r\n    GEB'L----EE''H\r\n    _YOG-SOTHOTH_\r\n    'NGAH'NG AI'Y\r\n    _ZHRO_!\"\r\n\r\nAt the very first word from Willett's mouth the previously commenced\r\nformula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster\r\nmade wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the\r\nawful name of _Yog-Sothoth_ was uttered, the hideous change began.\r\nIt was not merely a _dissolution_, but rather a _transformation_ or\r\n_recapitulation_; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the\r\nrest of the incantation could be pronounced.\r\n\r\nBut he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden\r\nsecrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had\r\nsubsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his\r\neyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that\r\nwhat he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he\r\nhad predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture\r\na year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin\r\ncoating of fine bluish-gray dust.",
