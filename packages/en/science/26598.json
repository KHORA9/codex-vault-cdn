Everyone connected with the woodworking\r\nindustry, or its use in manufactured products, is well aware of the\r\ndifficulties encountered in properly seasoning or removing the\r\nmoisture content without injury to the timber, and of its\r\nsusceptibility to atmospheric conditions after it has been thoroughly\r\nseasoned. There is perhaps no material or substance that gives up its\r\nmoisture with more resistance than wood does. It vigorously defies the\r\nefforts of human ingenuity to take away from it, without injury or\r\ndestruction, that with which nature has so generously supplied it.\r\n\r\nIn the past but little has been known of this matter further than the\r\nfact that wood contained moisture which had to be removed before the\r\nwood could be made use of for commercial purposes. Within recent\r\nyears, however, considerable interest has been awakened among\r\nwood-users in the operation of kiln-drying. The losses occasioned in\r\nair-drying and improper kiln-drying, and the necessity for getting the\r\nmaterial dry as quickly as possible after it has come from the saw, in\r\norder to prepare it for manufacturing purposes, are bringing about a\r\nrealization of the importance of a technical knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nSince this particular subject has never before been represented by any\r\ntechnical work, and appears to have been neglected, it is hoped that\r\nthe trade will appreciate the endeavor in bringing this book before\r\nthem, as well as the difficulties encountered in compiling it, as it\r\nis the first of its kind in existence. The author trusts that his\r\nefforts will present some information that may be applied with\r\nadvantage, or serve at least as a matter of consideration or\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nIn every case the aim has been to give the facts, and wherever a\r\nmachine or appliance has been illustrated or commented upon, or the\r\nname of the maker has been mentioned, it has not been with the\r\nintention either of recommending or disparaging his or their work, but\r\nhas been made use of merely to illustrate the text.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the following pages has been a work of pleasure to\r\nthe author. If they prove beneficial and of service to his\r\nfellow-workmen he will have been amply repaid.\r\n\r\n                                                      THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n    September,

With it he built\r\nfor himself a shelter from the elements; it provided him with fuel and\r\noft-times food, and the tree cut down and let across a stream formed\r\nthe first bridge. From it, too, he made his \"dug-out\" to travel along\r\nand across the rivers of the district in which he dwelt; so on down\r\nthrough the ages, for shipbuilding and constructive purposes, timber\r\nhas continued to our own time to be one of the most largely used of\r\nnature's products.\r\n\r\nAlthough wood has been in use so long and so universally, there still\r\nexists a remarkable lack of knowledge regarding its nature, not only\r\namong ordinary workmen, but among those who might be expected to know\r\nits properties. Consequently it is often used in a faulty and wasteful\r\nmanner. Experience has been almost the only teacher, and\r\ntheories--sometimes right, sometimes wrong--rather than well\r\nsubstantiated facts, lead the workman.\r\n\r\nOne reason for this imperfect knowledge lies in the fact that wood is\r\nnot a homogeneous material, but a complicated structure, and so\r\nvariable, that one piece will behave very differently from another,\r\nalthough cut from the same tree. Not only does the wood of one species\r\ndiffer from that of another, but the butt cut differs from that of the\r\ntop log, the heartwood from the sapwood; the wood of quickly-grown\r\nsapling of the abandoned field, from that of the slowly-grown, old\r\nmonarch of the forest. Even the manner in which the tree was cut and\r\nkept influences its behavior and quality. It is therefore extremely\r\ndifficult to study the material for the purpose of establishing\r\ngeneral laws.\r\n\r\nThe experienced woodsman will look for straight-grained, long-fibred\r\nwoods, with the absence of disturbing resinous and coloring matter,\r\nknots, etc., and will quickly distinguish the more porous red or black\r\noaks from the less porous white species, _Quercus alba_. That the\r\ninspection should have regard to defects and unhealthy conditions\r\n(often indicated by color) goes without saying, and such inspection is\r\nusually practised. That knots, even the smallest, are defects, which\r\nfor some uses condemn the material entirely, need hardly be mentioned.\r\nBut that \"season-checks,\" even those that have closed by subsequent\r\nshrinkage, remain elements of weakness is not so readily appreciated;\r\nyet there cannot be any doubt of this, since these, the intimate\r\nconnections of the wood fibres, when once interrupted are never\r\nreestablished.\r\n\r\nCareful woods-foremen and manufacturers, therefore, are concerned as\r\nto the manner in which their timber is treated after the felling, for,\r\naccording to the more or less careful seasoning of it, the season\r\nchecks--not altogether avoidable--are more or less abundant.\r\n\r\nThere is no country where wood is more lavishly used or criminally\r\nneglected than in the United States, and none in which nature has more\r\nbountifully provided for all reasonable requirements.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of proper efforts to secure reproduction, the most\r\nvaluable kinds are rapidly being decimated, and the necessity of a\r\nmore rational and careful use of what remains is clearly apparent. By\r\ngreater care in selection, however, not only will the duration of the\r\nsupply be extended, but more satisfactory results will accrue from its\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThere are few more extensive and wide-reaching subjects on which to\r\ntreat than timber, which in this book refers to dead timber--the\r\ntimber of commerce--as distinct from the living tree. Such a great\r\nnumber of different kinds of wood are now being brought from various\r\nparts of the world, so many new kinds are continually being added, and\r\nthe subject is more difficult to explain because timber of practically\r\nthe same character which comes from different localities goes under\r\ndifferent names, that if one were always to adhere to the botanical\r\nname there would be less confusion, although even botanists differ in\r\nsome cases as to names. Except in the cases of the older and better\r\nknown timbers, one rarely takes up two books dealing with timber and\r\nfinds the botanical names the same; moreover, trees of the same\r\nspecies may produce a much poorer quality of timber when obtained from\r\ndifferent localities in the same country, so that botanical knowledge\r\nwill not always allow us to dispense with other tests.\r\n\r\nThe structure of wood affords the only reliable means of\r\ndistinguishing the different kinds. Color, weight, smell, and other\r\nappearances, which are often direct or indirect results of structure,\r\nmay be helpful in this distinction, but cannot be relied upon\r\nentirely. Furthermore, structure underlies nearly all the technical\r\nproperties of this important product, and furnishes an explanation why\r\none piece differs in these properties from another. Structure explains\r\nwhy oak is heavier, stronger, and tougher than pine; why it is harder\r\nto saw and plane, and why it is so much more difficult to season\r\nwithout injury. From its less porous structure alone it is evident\r\nthat a piece of young and thrifty oak is stronger than the porous wood\r\nof an old or stunted tree, or that a Georgia or long-leaf pine excels\r\nwhite pine in weight and strength.\r\n\r\nKeeping especially in mind the arrangement and direction of the fibres\r\nof wood, it is clear at once why knots and \"cross-grain\" interfere\r\nwith the strength of timber. It is due to the structural peculiarities\r\nthat \"honeycombing\" occurs in rapid seasoning, that checks or cracks\r\nextend radially and follow pith rays, that tangent or \"bastard\" cut\r\nstock shrinks and warps more than that which is quarter-sawn. These\r\nsame peculiarities enable oak to take a better finish than basswood or\r\ncoarse-grained pine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Structure of Wood\r\n\r\nThe softwoods are made up chiefly of tracheids, or vertical cells\r\nclosed at the ends, and of the relatively short parenchyma cells of\r\nthe medullary rays which extend radially from the heart of the tree.\r\nThe course of the tracheids and the rays are at right angles to each\r\nother. Although the tracheids have their permeable portions or pits in\r\ntheir walls, liquids cannot pass through them with the greatest ease.\r\nThe softwoods do not contain \"pores\" or vessels and are therefore\r\ncalled \"non-porous\" woods.\r\n\r\nThe hardwoods are not so simple in structure as softwoods. They\r\ncontain not only rays, and in many cases tracheids, but also\r\nthick-walled cells called fibres and wood parenchyma for the storage\r\nof such foods as starches and sugars. The principal structural\r\nfeatures of the hardwoods are the pores or vessels. These are long\r\ntubes, the segments of which are made up of cells which have lost\r\ntheir end walls and joined end to end, forming continuous \"pipe lines\"\r\nfrom the roots to the leaves in the tree. Since they possess pores or\r\nvessels, the hardwoods are called \"porous\" woods.\r\n\r\nRed oak is an excellent example of a porous wood. In white oak the\r\nvessels of the heartwood especially are closed, very generally by\r\ningrowths called tyloses. This probably explains why red oak dries\r\nmore easily and rapidly than white oak.\r\n\r\nThe red and black gums are perhaps the simplest of the hardwoods in\r\nstructure. They are termed \"diffuse porous\" woods because of the\r\nnumerous scattered pores they contain. They have only vessels, wood\r\nfibres, and a few parenchyma cells. The medullary rays, although\r\npresent, are scarcely visible in most instances. The vessels are in\r\nmany cases open, and might be expected to offer relatively little\r\nresistance to drying.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Properties of Wood\r\n\r\nCertain general properties of wood may be discussed briefly. We know\r\nthat wood substance has the property of taking in moisture from the\r\nair until some balance is reached between the humidity of the air and\r\nthe moisture in the wood. This moisture which goes into the cell walls\r\nhygroscopic moisture, and the property which the wood substance has of\r\ntaking on hygroscopic moisture is termed hygroscopicity. Usually wood\r\ncontains not only hygroscopic moisture but also more or less free\r\nwater in the cell cavities. Especially is this true of sapwood. The\r\nfree water usually dries out quite rapidly with little or no shrinkage\r\nor other physical change.\r\n\r\nIn certain woods--for example, _Eucalyptus globulus_ and possibly some\r\noaks--shrinkage begins almost at once, thus introducing a factor at\r\nthe very start of the seasoning process which makes these woods very\r\nrefractory.\r\n\r\nThe cell walls of some species, including the two already mentioned,\r\nsuch as Western red cedar and redwood, become soft and plastic when\r\nhot and moist. If the fibres are hot enough and very wet, they are not\r\nstrong enough to withstand the resulting force of the atmospheric\r\npressure and the tensile force exerted by the departing free water,\r\nand the result is that the cells actually collapse.\r\n\r\nIn general, however, the hygroscopic moisture necessary to saturate\r\nthe cell walls is termed the \"fibre saturation point.\" This amount has\r\nbeen found to be from 25 to 30 per cent of the dry wood weight. Unlike\r\n_Eucalyptus globulus_ and certain oaks, the gums do not begin to\r\nshrink until the moisture content has been reduced to about 30 per\r\ncent of the dry wood weight. These woods are not subject to collapse,\r\nalthough their fibres become very plastic while hot and moist.\r\n\r\nUpon the peculiar properties of each wood depends the difficulty or\r\nease of the seasoning process.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Classes of Trees\r\n\r\nThe timber of the United States is furnished by three well-defined\r\nclasses of trees: (1) The needle-leaved, naked-seeded conifers, such\r\nas pine, cedar, etc., (2) the broad-leaved trees such as oak poplar,\r\netc., and (3) to an inferior extent by the (one-seed leaf) palms,\r\nyuccas, and their allies, which are confined to the most southern\r\nparts of the country.\r\n\r\nBroad-leaved trees are also known as deciduous trees, although,\r\nespecially in warm countries, many of them are evergreen, while the\r\nneedle-leaved trees (conifers) are commonly termed \"evergreens,\"\r\nalthough the larch, bald cypress, and others shed their leaves every\r\nfall, and even the names \"broad-leaved\" and \"coniferous,\" though\r\nperhaps the most satisfactory, are not at all exact, for the conifer\r\n\"ginkgo\" has broad leaves and bears no cones.\r\n\r\nAmong the woodsmen, the woods of broad-leaved trees are known as\r\n\"hardwoods,\" though poplar is as soft as pine, and the \"coniferous\r\nwoods\" are known as \"softwoods,\" notwithstanding the fact that yew\r\nranks high in hardness even when compared with \"hardwoods.\"\r\n\r\nBoth in the number of different kinds of trees or species and still\r\nmore in the importance of their product, the conifers and broad-leaved\r\ntrees far excel the palms and their relatives.\r\n\r\nIn the manner of their growth both the conifers and broad-leaved trees\r\nbehave alike, adding each year a new layer of wood, which covers the\r\nold wood in all parts of the stem and limbs. Thus the trunk continues\r\nto grow in thickness throughout the life of the tree by additions\r\n(annual rings), which in temperate climates are, barring accidents,\r\naccurate records of the tree. With the palms and their relatives the\r\nstem remains generally of the same diameter, the tree of a hundred\r\nyears old being as thick as it was at ten years, the growth of these\r\nbeing only at the top. Even where a peripheral increase takes place,\r\nas in the yuccas, the wood is not laid on in well-defined layers for\r\nthe structure remains irregular throughout. Though alike in the manner\r\nof their growth, and therefore similar in their general make-up,\r\nconifers and broad-leaved trees differ markedly in the details of\r\ntheir structure and the character of their wood.\r\n\r\nThe wood of all conifers is very simple in its structure, the fibres\r\ncomposing the main part of the wood all being alike and their\r\narrangement regular. The wood of the broad-leaved trees is complex in\r\nstructure; it is made up of different kinds of cells and fibres and\r\nlacks the regularity of arrangement so noticeable in the conifers.\r\nThis difference is so great that in a study of wood structure it is\r\nbest to consider the two kinds separately.\r\n\r\nIn this country the great variety of woods, and especially of useful\r\nwoods, often makes the mere distinction of the kind or species of tree\r\nmost difficult. Thus there are at least eight pines of the thirty-five\r\nnative ones in the market, some of which so closely resemble each\r\nother in their minute structure that one can hardly tell them apart,\r\nand yet they differ in quality and are often mixed or confounded in\r\nthe trade. Of the thirty-six oaks, of which probably not less than six\r\nor eight are marketed, we can readily recognize by means of their\r\nminute anatomy at least two tribes--the white and black oaks. The same\r\nis true of the eleven kinds of hickory, the six kinds of ash, etc.,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe list of names of all trees indigenous to the United States, as\r\nenumerated by the United States Forest Service, is 495 in number, the\r\ndesignation of \"tree\" being applied to all woody plants which produce\r\nnaturally in their native habitat one main, erect stem, bearing a\r\ndefinite crown, no matter what size they attain.\r\n\r\nTimber is produced only by the Spermatophyta, or seed-bearing plants,\r\nwhich are subdivided into the Gymnosperms (conifers), and Angiosperms\r\n(broad-leaved). The conifer or cone-bearing tree, to which belong the\r\npines, larches, and firs, is one of the three natural orders of\r\nGymnosperms. These are generally classed as \"softwoods,\" and are more\r\nextensively scattered and more generally used than any other class of\r\ntimber, and are simple and regular in structure. The so-called\r\n\"hardwoods\" are \"Dicotyledons\" or broad-leaved trees, a subdivision of\r\nthe Angiosperms. They are generally of slower growth, and produce\r\nharder timber than the conifers, but not necessarily so. Basswood,\r\npoplar, sycamore, and some of the gums, though classed with the\r\nhardwoods, are not nearly as hard as some of the pines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION II\r\n\r\n                           CONIFEROUS TREES\r\n\r\n                     WOOD OF THE CONIFEROUS TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nExamining a smooth cross-section or end face of a well-grown log of\r\nGeorgia pine, we distinguish an envelope of reddish, scaly bark, a\r\nsmall, whitish pith at the center, and between these the wood in a\r\ngreat number of concentric rings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Bark and Pith\r\n\r\nThe bark of a pine stem is thickest and roughest near the base,\r\ndecreases rapidly in thickness from one to one-half inches at the\r\nstump to one-tenth inch near the top of the tree, and forms in general\r\nabout ten to fifteen per cent of the entire trunk. The pith is quite\r\nthick, usually one-eighth to one-fifth inch in southern species,\r\nthough much less so in white pine, and is very thin, one-fifteenth to\r\none twenty-fifth inch in cypress, cedar, and larch.\r\n\r\nIn woods with a thick pith, the pith is finest at the stump, grows\r\nrapidly thicker toward the top, and becomes thinner again in the crown\r\nand limbs, the first one to five rings adjoining it behaving\r\nsimilarly.\r\n\r\nWhat is called the pith was once the seedling tree, and in many of the\r\npines and firs, especially after they have been seasoning for a good\r\nwhile, this is distinctly noticeable in the center of the log, and\r\ndetaches itself from the surrounding wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Sap and Heartwood\r\n\r\nWood is composed of duramen or heartwood, and alburnum or sapwood, and\r\nwhen dry consists approximately of 49 per cent by weight of carbon, 6\r\nper cent of hydrogen, 44 per cent of oxygen, and 1 per cent of ash,\r\nwhich is fairly uniform for all species. The sapwood is the external\r\nand youngest portion of the tree, and often constitutes a very\r\nconsiderable proportion of it. It lies next the bark, and after a\r\ncourse of years, sometimes many, as in the case of oaks, sometimes\r\nfew, as in the case of firs, it becomes hardened and ultimately forms\r\nthe duramen or heartwood. Sapwood is generally of a white or light\r\ncolor, almost invariably lighter in color than the heartwood, and is\r\nvery conspicuous in the darker-colored woods, as for instance the\r\nyellow sapwood of mahogany and similiar colored woods, and the reddish\r\nbrown heartwood; or the yellow sapwood of _Lignum-vitae_ and the dark\r\ngreen heartwood. Sapwood forms a much larger proportion of some trees\r\nthan others, but being on the outer circumference it always forms a\r\nlarge proportion of the timber, and even in sound, hard pine will be\r\nfrom 40 per cent to 60 per cent of the tree and in some cases much\r\nmore. It is really imperfect wood, while the duramen or heartwood is\r\nthe perfect wood; the heartwood of the mature tree was the sapwood of\r\nits earlier years. Young trees when cut down are almost all sapwood,\r\nand practically useless as good, sound timber; it is, however, through\r\nthe sapwood that the life-giving juices which sustain the tree arise\r\nfrom the soil, and if the sapwood be cut through, as is done when\r\n\"girdling,\" the tree quickly dies, as it can derive no further\r\nnourishment from the soil. Although absolutely necessary to the\r\ngrowing tree, sapwood is often objectionable to the user, as it is the\r\nfirst part to decay. In this sapwood many cells are active, store up\r\nstarch, and otherwise assist in the life processes of the tree,\r\nalthough only the last or outer layer of cells forms the growing part,\r\nand the true life of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe duramen or heartwood is the inner, darker part of the log. In the\r\nheartwood all the cells are lifeless cases, and serve only the\r\nmechanical function of keeping the tree from breaking under its own\r\ngreat weight or from being laid low by the winds. The darker color of\r\nthe heartwood is due to infiltration of chemical substances into the\r\ncell walls, but the cavities of the cells in pine are not filled up,\r\nas is sometimes believed, nor do their walls grow thicker, nor are the\r\nwalls any more liquified than in the sapwood.\r\n\r\nSapwood varies in width and in the number of rings which it contains\r\neven in different parts of the same tree. The same year's growth which\r\nis sapwood in one part of a disk may be heartwood in another. Sapwood\r\nis widest in the main part of the stem and often varies within\r\nconsiderable limits and without apparent regularity. Generally, it\r\nbecomes narrower toward the top and in the limbs, its width varying\r\nwith the diameter, and being the least in a given disk on the side\r\nwhich has the shortest radius. Sapwood of old and stunted pines is\r\ncomposed of more rings than that of young and thrifty specimens. Thus\r\nin a pine two hundred and fifty years old a layer of wood or an annual\r\nring does not change from sapwood to heartwood until seventy or eighty\r\nyears after it is formed, while in a tree one hundred years old or\r\nless it remains sapwood only from thirty to sixty years.\r\n\r\nThe width of the sapwood varies considerably for different kinds of\r\npine. It is small for long-leaf and white pine and great for loblolly\r\nand Norway pines. Occupying the peripheral part of the trunk, the\r\nproportion which it forms of the entire mass of the stem is always\r\ngreat. Thus even in old long-leaf pines, the sapwood forms 40 per cent\r\nof the merchantable log, while in the loblolly and in all young trees\r\nthe sapwood forms the bulk of the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      The Annual or Yearly Rings\r\n\r\nThe concentric annual or yearly rings which appear on the end face of\r\na log are cross-sections of so many thin layers of wood. Each such\r\nlayer forms an envelope around its inner neighbor, and is in turn\r\ncovered by the adjoining layer without, so that the whole stem is\r\nbuilt up of a series of thin, hollow cylinders, or rather cones.\r\n\r\nA new layer of wood is formed each season, covering the entire stem,\r\nas well as all the living branches. The thickness of this layer or the\r\nwidth of the yearly ring varies greatly in different trees, and also\r\nin different parts of the same tree.\r\n\r\nIn a normally-grown, thrifty pine log the rings are widest near the\r\npith, growing more and more narrow toward the bark. Thus the central\r\ntwenty rings in a disk of an old long-leaf pine may each be one-eighth\r\nto one-sixth inch wide, while the twenty rings next to the bark may\r\naverage only one-thirtieth inch.\r\n\r\nIn our forest trees, rings of one-half inch in width occur only near\r\nthe center in disks of very thrifty trees, of both conifers and\r\nhardwoods. One-twelfth inch represents good, thrifty growth, and the\r\nminimum width of one two hundred inch is often seen in stunted spruce\r\nand pine. The average width of rings in well-grown, old white pine\r\nwill vary from one-twelfth to one-eighteenth inch, while in the slower\r\ngrowing long-leaf pine it may be one twenty-fifth to one-thirtieth of\r\nan inch. The same layer of wood is widest near the stump in very\r\nthrifty young trees, especially if grown in the open park; but in old\r\nforest trees the same year's growth is wider at the upper part of the\r\ntree, being narrowest near the stump, and often also near the very tip\r\nof the stem. Generally the rings are widest near the center, growing\r\nnarrower toward the bark.\r\n\r\nIn logs from stunted trees the order is often reversed, the interior\r\nrings being thin and the outer rings widest. Frequently, too, zones or\r\nbands of very narrow rings, representing unfavorable periods of\r\ngrowth, disturb the general regularity.\r\n\r\nFew trees, even among pines, furnish a log with truly circular\r\ncross-section. Usually it is an oval, and at the stump commonly quite\r\nan irregular figure. Moreover, even in very regular or circular disks\r\nthe pith is rarely in the center, and frequently one radius is\r\nconspicuously longer than its opposite, the width of some rings, if\r\nnot all, being greater on one side than on the other. This is nearly\r\nalways so in the limbs, the lower radius exceeding the upper. In\r\nextreme cases, especially in the limbs, a ring is frequently\r\nconspicuous on one side, and almost or entirely lost to view on the\r\nother. Where the rings are extremely narrow, the dark portion of the\r\nring is often wanting, the color being quite uniform and light. The\r\ngreater regularity or irregularity of the annual rings has much to do\r\nwith the technical qualities of the timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Spring- and Summer-Wood\r\n\r\nExamining the rings more closely, it is noticed that each ring is made\r\nup of an inner, softer, light-colored and an outer, or peripheral,\r\nfirmer and darker-colored portion. Being formed in the forepart of the\r\nseason, the inner, light-colored part is termed spring-wood, the\r\nouter, darker-portioned being the summer-wood of the ring. Since the\r\nlatter is very heavy and firm it determines to a very large extent the\r\nweight and strength of the wood, and as its darker color influences\r\nthe shade of color of the entire piece of wood, this color effect\r\nbecomes a valuable aid in distinguishing heavy and strong from light\r\nand soft pine wood.\r\n\r\nIn most hard pines, like the long-leaf, the dark summer-wood appears\r\nas a distinct band, so that the yearly ring is composed of two sharply\r\ndefined bands--an inner, the spring-wood, and an outer, the\r\nsummer-wood. But in some cases, even in hard pines, and normally in\r\nthe woods of white pines, the spring-wood passes gradually into the\r\ndarker summer-wood, so that a darkly defined line occurs only where\r\nthe spring-wood of one ring abuts against the summer-wood of its\r\nneighbor. It is this clearly defined line which enables the eye to\r\ndistinguish even the very narrow lines in old pines and spruces.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, especially in the trunks of Southern pines, and\r\nnormally on the lower side of pine limbs, there occur dark bands of\r\nwood in the spring-wood portion of the ring, giving rise to false\r\nrings, which mislead in a superficial counting of rings. In the disks\r\ncut from limbs these dark bands often occupy the greater part of the\r\nring, and appear as \"lunes,\" or sickle-shaped figures. The wood of\r\nthese dark bands is similar to that of the true summer-wood. The cells\r\nhave thick walls, but usually the compressed or flattened form.\r\nNormally, the summer-wood forms a greater proportion of the rings in\r\nthe part of the tree formed during the period of thriftiest growth. In\r\nan old tree this proportion is very small in the first two to five\r\nrings about the pith, and also in the part next to the bark, the\r\nintermediate part showing a greater proportion of summer-wood. It is\r\nalso greatest in a disk taken from near the stump, and decreases\r\nupward in the stem, thus fully accounting for the difference in weight\r\nand firmness of the wood of these different parts.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1. Board of Pine. CS, cross-section; RS,\r\n    radial section; TS, tangential section; _sw_, summer-wood;\r\n    _spw_, spring-wood.]\r\n\r\nIn the long-leaf pine the summer-wood often forms scarcely ten per\r\ncent of the wood in the central five rings; forty to fifty per cent of\r\nthe next one hundred rings, about thirty per cent of the next fifty,\r\nand only about twenty per cent in the fifty rings next to the bark. It\r\naverages forty-five per cent of the wood of the stump and only\r\ntwenty-four per cent of that of the top.\r\n\r\nSawing the log into boards, the yearly rings are represented on the\r\nboard faces of the middle board (radial sections) by narrow parallel\r\nstrips (see Fig. 1), an inner, lighter stripe and its outer, darker\r\nneighbor always corresponding to one annual ring.\r\n\r\nOn the faces of the boards nearest the slab (tangential or bastard\r\nboards) the several years' growth should also appear as parallel, but\r\nmuch broader stripes. This they do if the log is short and very\r\nperfect. Usually a variety of pleasing patterns is displayed on the\r\nboards, depending on the position of the saw cut and on the regularity\r\nof growth of the log (see Fig. 1). Where the cut passes through a\r\nprominence (bump or crook) of the log, irregular, concentric circlets\r\nand ovals are produced, and on almost all tangent boards arrow or\r\nV-shaped forms occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Anatomical Structure\r\n\r\nHolding a well-smoothed disk or cross-section one-eighth inch thick\r\ntoward the light, it is readily seen that pine wood is a very porous\r\nstructure. If viewed with a strong magnifier, the little tubes,\r\nespecially in the spring-wood of the rings, are easily distinguished,\r\nand their arrangement in regular, straight, radial rows is apparent.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2. Wood of Spruce. 1, natural size; 2,\r\n    small part of one ring magnified 100 times. The vertical\r\n    tubes are wood fibres, in this case all \"tracheids.\" _m_,\r\n    medullary or pith ray; _n_, transverse tracheids of ray; _a_,\r\n    _b_, and _c_, bordered pits of the tracheids, more enlarged.]\r\n\r\nScattered through the summer-wood portion of the rings, numerous\r\nirregular grayish dots (the resin ducts) disturb the uniformity and\r\nregularity of the structure. Magnified one hundred times, a piece of\r\nspruce, which is similar to pine, presents a picture like that shown\r\nin Fig. 2. Only short pieces of the tubes or cells of which the wood\r\nis composed are represented in the picture. The total length of these\r\nfibres is from one-twentieth to one-fifth inch, being the smallest\r\nnear the pith, and is fifty to one hundred times as great as their\r\nwidth (see Fig. 3). They are tapered and closed at their ends,\r\npolygonal or rounded and thin-walled, with large cavity, lumen or\r\ninternal space in the spring-wood, and thick-walled and flattened\r\nradially, with the internal space or lumen much reduced in the\r\nsummer-wood (see right-hand portion of Fig. 2). This flattening,\r\ntogether with the thicker walls of the cells, which reduces the lumen,\r\ncauses the greater firmness and darker color of the summer-wood.\r\nThere is more material in the same volume. As shown in the figure, the\r\ntubes, cells or \"tracheids\" are decorated on their walls by\r\ncirclet-like structures, the \"bordered pits,\" sections of which are\r\nseen more magnified as _a_, _b_, and _c_, Fig. 2. These pits are in\r\nthe nature of pores, covered by very thin membranes, and serve as\r\nwaterways between the cells or tracheids. The dark lines on the side\r\nof the smaller piece (1, Fig. 2) appear when magnified (in 2, Fig. 2)\r\nas tiers of eight to ten rows of cells, which run radially (parallel\r\nto the rows of tubes or tracheids), and are seen as bands on the\r\nradial face and as rows of pores on the tangential face. These bands\r\nor tiers of cell rows are the medullary rays or pith rays, and are\r\ncommon to all our lumber woods.\r\n\r\nIn the pines and other conifers they are quite small, but they can\r\nreadily be seen even without a magnifier. If a radial surface of\r\nsplit-wood (not smoothed) is examined, the entire radial face will be\r\nseen almost covered with these tiny structures, which appear as fine\r\nbut conspicuous cross-lines. As shown in Fig. 2, the cells of the\r\nmedullary or pith are smaller and very much shorter than the wood\r\nfibre or tracheids, and their long axis is at right angles to that of\r\nthe fiber.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3. Group of Fibres from Pine Wood. Partly\r\n    schematic. The little circles are \"border pits\" (see Fig. 2,\r\n    _a-c_). The transverse rows of square pits indicate the\r\n    places of contact of these fibres and the cells of the\r\n    neighboring pith rays. Magnified about 25 times.]\r\n\r\nIn pines and spruces the cells of the upper and lower rows of each\r\ntier or pith ray have \"bordered\" pits, like those of the wood fibre or\r\ntracheids proper, but the cells of the intermediate rows in the rays\r\nof cedars, etc., have only \"simple\" pits, _i.e._, pits devoid of the\r\nsaucer-like \"border\" or rim. In pine, many of the pith rays are larger\r\nthan the majority, each containing a whitish line, the horizontal\r\nresin duct, which, though much smaller, resembles the vertical ducts\r\non the cross-section. The larger vertical resin ducts are best\r\nobserved on removal of the bark from a fresh piece of white pine cut\r\nin the winter where they appear as conspicuous white lines, extending\r\noften for many inches up and down the stem. Neither the horizontal nor\r\nthe vertical resin ducts are vessels or cells, but are openings\r\nbetween cells, _i.e._, intercellular spaces, in which the resin\r\naccumulates, freely oozing out when the ducts of a fresh piece of\r\nsapwood are cut. They are present only in our coniferous woods, and\r\neven here they are restricted to pine, spruce, and larch, and are\r\nnormally absent in fir, cedar, cypress, and yew. Altogether, the\r\nstructure of coniferous woods is very simple and regular, the bulk\r\nbeing made up of the small fibres called tracheids, the disturbing\r\nelements of pith rays and resin ducts being insignificant, and hence\r\nthe great uniformity and great technical value of coniferous woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  LIST OF IMPORTANT CONIFEROUS WOODS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 CEDAR\r\n\r\nLight soft, stiff, not strong, of fine texture. Sap- and heartwood\r\ndistinct, the former lighter, the latter a dull grayish brown or red.\r\nThe wood seasons rapidly, shrinks and checks but little, and is very\r\ndurable in contact with the soil. Used like soft pine, but owing to\r\nits great durability preferred for shingles, etc. Cedars usually occur\r\nscattered, but they form in certain localities forests of considerable\r\nextent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (_a_) White Cedars\r\n\r\n=1. White Cedar= (_Thuya occidentalis_) (Arborvitæ, Tree of Life).\r\nHeartwood light yellowish brown, sapwood nearly white. Wood light,\r\nsoft, not strong, of fine texture, very durable in contact with the\r\nsoil, very fragrant. Scattered along streams and lakes, frequently\r\ncovering extensive swamps; rarely large enough for lumber, but\r\ncommonly used for fence posts, rails, railway ties, and shingles. This\r\nspecies has been extensively cultivated as an ornamental tree for at\r\nleast a century. Maine to Minnesota and northward.\r\n\r\n=2. Canoe Cedar= (_Thuya gigantea_) (Red Cedar of the West). In Oregon\r\nand Washington a very large tree, covering extensive swamps; in the\r\nmountains much smaller, skirting the water courses. An important\r\nlumber tree. The wood takes a fine polish; suitable for interior\r\nfinishing, as there is much variety of shading in the color.\r\nWashington to northern California and eastward to Montana.\r\n\r\n=3. White Cedar= (_Chamæcyparis thyoides_). Medium-sized tree. Heartwood\r\nlight brown with rose tinge, sapwood paler. Wood light, soft, not\r\nstrong, close-grained, easily worked, very durable in contact with the\r\nsoil and very fragrant.

Red Cedar= (_Juniperus Virginiana_) (Savin Juniper, Juniper, Red\r\nJuniper, Juniper Bush, Pencil Cedar). Heartwood dull red color, thin\r\nsapwood nearly white. Close even grain, compact structure. Wood light,\r\nsoft, weak, brittle, easily worked, durable in contact with the soil,\r\nand fragrant. Used for ties, posts, interior finish, pencil cases,\r\ncigar boxes, silos, tanks, and especially for lead pencils, for which\r\npurpose alone several million feet are cut each year. A small to\r\nmedium-sized tree scattered through the forests, or in the West\r\nsparsely covering extensive areas (cedar brakes). The red cedar is the\r\nmost widely distributed conifer of the United States, occurring from\r\nthe Atlantic to the Pacific, and from Florida to Minnesota. Attains a\r\nsuitable size for lumber only in the Southern, and more especially the\r\nGulf States.\r\n\r\n=8. Red Cedar= (_Juniperus communis_) (Ground Cedar). Small-sized tree,\r\nits maximum height being about 25 feet. It is found widely distributed\r\nthroughout the Northern hemisphere. Wood in its quality similar to the\r\npreceding. The fruit of this species is gathered in large quantities\r\nand used in the manufacture of gin; whose peculiar flavor and\r\nmedicinal properties are due to the oil of Juniper berries, which is\r\nsecured by adding the crushed fruit to undistilled grain spirit, or by\r\nallowing the vapor to pass over it before condensation. Used locally\r\nfor construction purposes, fence posts, etc. Ranges from Greenland to\r\nAlaska, in the East, southward to Pennsylvania and northern Nebraska;\r\nin the Rocky Mountains to Texas, Mexico, and Arizona.\r\n\r\n=9. Redwood= (_Sequoia sempervirens_) (Sequoia, California Redwood,\r\nCoast Redwood). Wood in its quality and uses like white cedar. Thick,\r\nred heartwood, changing to reddish brown when seasoned. Thin sapwood,\r\nnearly white, coarse, straight grain, compact structure. Light, not\r\nstrong, soft, very durable in contact with the soil, not resinous,\r\neasily worked, does not burn easily, receives high polish. Used for\r\ntimber, shingles, flumes, fence posts, coffins, railway ties, water\r\npipes, interior decorations, and cabinetmaking. A very large tree,\r\nlimited to the coast ranges of California, and forming considerable\r\nforests, which are rapidly being converted into lumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CYPRESS\r\n\r\n=10. Cypress= (_Taxodium distinchum_) (Bald Cypress, Black, White, and\r\nRed Cypress, Pecky Cypress). Wood in its appearance, quality, and uses\r\nsimilar to white cedar. \"Black\" and \"White Cypress\" are heavy and\r\nlight forms of the same species. Heartwood brownish; sapwood nearly\r\nwhite. Wood close, straight-grain, frequently full of small holes\r\ncaused by disease known as \"pecky cypress.\" Greasy appearance and\r\nfeeling. Wood light, soft, not strong, durable in contact with the\r\nsoil, takes a fine polish. Green wood often very heavy. Used for\r\ncarpentry, building construction, shingles, cooperage, railway ties,\r\nsilos, tanks, vehicles, and washing machines. The cypress is a large,\r\ndeciduous tree, inhabiting swampy lands, and along rivers and coasts\r\nof the Southern parts of the United States. Grows to a height of 150\r\nfeet and 12 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  FIR\r\n\r\nThis name is frequently applied to wood and to trees which are not\r\nfir; most commonly to spruce, but also, especially in English markets,\r\nto pine. It resembles spruce, but is easily distinguished from it, as\r\nwell as from pine and larch, by the absence of resin ducts. Quality,\r\nuses, and habits similar to spruce.\r\n\r\n=11. Balsam Fir= (_Abies balsamea_) (Balsam, Fir Tree, Balm of Gilead\r\nFir). Heartwood white to brownish; sapwood lighter color;\r\ncoarse-grained, compact structure, satiny. Wood light, not durable or\r\nstrong, resinous, easily split. Used for boxes, crates, doors,\r\nmillwork, cheap lumber, paper pulp. Inferior to white pine or spruce,\r\nyet often mixed and sold with these species in the lumber market. A\r\nmedium-sized tree scattered throughout the northern pineries, and cut\r\nin lumber operations whenever of sufficient size. Minnesota to Maine\r\nand northward.\r\n\r\n=12. White Fir= (_Abies grandis_ and _Abies concolor_). Medium-to very\r\nlarge-sized tree, forming an important part of most of the Western\r\nmountain forests, and furnishes much of the lumber of the respective\r\nregions. The former occurs from Vancouver to California, and the\r\nlatter from Oregon to Arizona and eastward to Colorado and Mexico. The\r\nwood is soft and light, coarse-grained, not unlike the \"Swiss pine\" of\r\nEurope, but darker and firmer, and is not suitable for any purpose\r\nrequiring strength. It is used for boxes, barrels, and to a small\r\nextent for wood pulp.\r\n\r\n=13. White Fir= (_Abies amabalis_). Good-sized tree, often forming\r\nextensive mountain forests. Wood similar in quality and uses to _Abies\r\ngrandis_. Cascade Mountains of Washington and Oregon.\r\n\r\n=14. Red Fir= (_Abies nobilis_) (Noble Fir) (not to be confounded with\r\nDouglas spruce. See No. 40). Large to very large-sized tree, forming\r\nextensive forests on the slope of the mountains between 3,000 and\r\n4,000 feet elevation. Cascade Mountains of Oregon.\r\n\r\n=15. Red Fir= (_Abies magnifica_). Very large-sized tree, forming\r\nforests about the base of Mount Shasta. Sierra Nevada Mountains of\r\nCalifornia, from Mount Shasta southward.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HEMLOCK\r\n\r\nLight to medium weight, soft, stiff, but brittle, commonly\r\ncross-grained, rough and splintery. Sapwood and heartwood not well\r\ndefined. The wood of a light reddish-gray color, free from resin\r\nducts, moderately durable, shrinks and warps considerably in drying,\r\nwears rough, retains nails firmly. Used principally for dimension\r\nstuff and timbers. Hemlocks are medium- to large-sized trees, commonly\r\nscattered among broad-leaved trees and conifers, but often forming\r\nforests of almost pure growth.\r\n\r\n=16. Hemlock= (_Tsuga canadensis_) (Hemlock Spruce, Peruche).\r\nMedium-sized tree, furnishes almost all the hemlock of the Eastern\r\nmarket. Maine to Wisconsin, also following the Alleghanies southward\r\nto Georgia and Alabama.\r\n\r\n=17. Hemlock= (_Tsuga mertensiana_). Large-sized tree, wood claimed to\r\nbe heavier and harder than the Eastern species and of superior\r\nquality. Used for pulp wood, floors, panels, and newels. It is not\r\nsuitable for heavy construction, especially where exposed to the\r\nweather, it is straight in grain and will take a good polish. Not\r\nadapted for use partly in and partly out of the ground; in fresh water\r\nas piles will last about ten years, but as it is softer than fir it is\r\nless able to stand driving successfully. Washington to California and\r\neastward to Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LARCH or TAMARACK\r\n\r\nWood like the best of hard pine both in appearance, quality, and uses,\r\nand owing to its great durability somewhat preferred in shipbuilding,\r\nfor telegraph poles, and railway ties. In its structure it resembles\r\nspruce. The larches are deciduous trees, occasionally covering\r\nconsiderable areas, but usually scattered among other conifers.\r\n\r\n=18. Tamarack= (_Larix laricina_ var. _Americana_) (Larch, Black Larch,\r\nAmerican Larch, Hacmatac). Heartwood light brown in color, sapwood\r\nnearly white, coarse conspicuous grain, compact structure, annual\r\nrings pronounced. Wood heavy, hard, very strong, durable in contact\r\nwith the soil. Used for railway ties, fence posts, sills, ship\r\ntimbers, telegraph poles, flagstaffs. Medium-sized tree, often\r\ncovering swamps, in which case it is smaller and of poor quality.\r\nMaine to Minnesota, and southward to Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n=19. Tamarack= (_Larix occidentalis_) (Western Larch, Larch).\r\nLarge-sized trees, scattered, locally abundant. Is little inferior to\r\noak in strength and durability. Heartwood of a light brown color with\r\nlighter sapwood, has a fine, slightly satiny grain, and is fairly free\r\nfrom knots; the annual rings are distant. Used for railway ties and\r\nshipbuilding. Washington and Oregon to Montana.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PINE\r\n\r\nVery variable, very light and soft in \"soft\" pine, such as white pine;\r\nof medium weight to heavy and quite hard in \"hard\" pine, of which the\r\nlong-leaf or Georgia pine is the extreme form. Usually it is stiff,\r\nquite strong, of even texture, and more or less resinous. The sapwood\r\nis yellowish white; the heartwood orange brown. Pine shrinks\r\nmoderately, seasons rapidly and without much injury; it works easily,\r\nis never too hard to nail (unlike oak or hickory); it is mostly quite\r\ndurable when in contact with the soil, and if well seasoned is not\r\nsubject to the attacks of boring insects. The heavier the wood, the\r\ndarker, stronger, and harder it is, and the more it shrinks and checks\r\nwhen seasoning. Pine is used more extensively than any other wood. It\r\nis the principal wood in carpentry, as well as in all heavy\r\nconstruction, bridges, trestles, etc. It is also used in almost every\r\nother wood industry; for spars, masts, planks, and timbers in\r\nshipbuilding, in car and wagon construction, in cooperage and\r\nwoodenware; for crates and boxes, in furniture work, for toys and\r\npatterns, water pipes, excelsior, etc. Pines are usually large-sized\r\ntrees with few branches, the straight, cylindrical, useful stem\r\nforming by far the greatest part of the tree. They occur gregariously,\r\nforming vast forests, a fact which greatly facilitates their\r\nexploitation. Of the many special terms applied to pine as lumber,\r\ndenoting sometimes differences in quality, the following deserve\r\nattention: \"White pine,\" \"pumpkin pine,\" \"soft pine,\" in the Eastern\r\nmarkets refer to the wood of the white pine (_Pinus strobus_), and on\r\nthe Pacific Coast to that of the sugar pine (_Pinus lambertiana_).\r\n\"Yellow pine\" is applied in the trade to all the Southern lumber\r\npines; in the Northwest it is also applied to the pitch pine (_Pinus\r\nregida_); in the West it refers mostly to the bull pine (_Pinus\r\nponderosa_). \"Yellow long-leaf pine\" (Georgia pine), chiefly used in\r\nadvertisements, refers to the long-leaf Pine (_Pinus palustris_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (_a_) Soft Pines\r\n\r\n=20. White Pine= (_Pinus strobus_) (Soft Pine, Pumpkin Pine, Weymouth\r\nPine, Yellow Deal). Large to very large-sized tree, reaching a height\r\nof 80 to 100 feet or more, and in some instances 7 or 8 feet in\r\ndiameter. For the last fifty years the most important timber tree of\r\nthe United States, furnishing the best quality of soft pine. Heartwood\r\ncream white; sapwood nearly white. Close straight grain, compact\r\nstructure; comparatively free from knots and resin. Soft, uniform;\r\nseasons well; easy to work; nails without splitting; fairly durable in\r\ncontact with the soil; and shrinks less than other species of pine.\r\nPaints well. Used for carpentry, construction, building, spars, masts,\r\nmatches, boxes, etc., etc., etc.\r\n\r\n=21. Sugar Pine= (_Pinus lambertiana_) (White Pine, Pumpkin Pine, Soft\r\nPine). A very large tree, forming extensive forests in the Rocky\r\nMountains and furnishing most of the timber of the western United\r\nStates. It is confined to Oregon and California, and grows at from\r\n1,500 to 8,000 feet above sea level. Has an average height of 150 to\r\n175 feet and a diameter of 4 to 5 feet, with a maximum height of 235\r\nfeet and 12 feet in diameter. The wood is soft, durable,\r\nstraight-grained, easily worked, very resinous, and has a satiny\r\nluster which makes it appreciated for interior work. It is extensively\r\nused for doors, blinds, sashes, and interior finish, also for\r\ndruggists' drawers, owing to its freedom from odor, for oars,\r\nmouldings, shipbuilding, cooperage, shingles, and fruit boxes. Oregon\r\nand California.\r\n\r\n=22. White Pine= (_Pinus monticolo_). A large tree, at home in Montana,\r\nIdaho, and the Pacific States. Most common and locally used in\r\nnorthern Idaho.\r\n\r\n=23. White Pine= (_Pinus flexilis_). A small-sized tree, forming\r\nmountain forests of considerable extent and locally used. Eastern\r\nRocky Mountain slopes, Montana to New Mexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           (_b_) Hard Pines\r\n\r\n=24. Long-Leaf Pine= (_Pinus palustris_) (Georgia Pine, Southern Pine,\r\nYellow Pine, Southern Hard Pine, Long-straw Pine, etc.). Large-sized\r\ntree. This species furnishes the hardest and most durable as well as\r\none of the strongest pine timbers in the market. Heartwood orange,\r\nsapwood lighter color, the annual rings are strongly marked, and it is\r\nfull of resinous matter, making it very durable, but difficult to\r\nwork. It is hard, dense, and strong, fairly free from knots,\r\nstraight-grained, and one of the best timbers for heavy engineering\r\nwork where great strength, long span, and durability are required.\r\nUsed for heavy construction, shipbuilding, cars, docks, beams, ties,\r\nflooring, and interior decoration. Coast region from North Carolina to\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\n=25. Bull Pine= (_Pinus ponderosa_) (Yellow Pine, Western Yellow Pine,\r\nWestern Pine, Western White Pine, California White Pine). Medium- to\r\nvery large-sized tree, forming extensive forests in the Pacific and\r\nRocky Mountain regions. Heartwood reddish brown, sapwood yellowish\r\nwhite, and there is often a good deal of it. The resinous smell of the\r\nwood is very remarkable. It is extensively used for beams, flooring,\r\nceilings, and building work generally.\r\n\r\n=26. Bull Pine= (_Pinus Jeffreyi_) (Black Pine). Large-sized tree, wood\r\nresembles _Pinus ponderosa_ and replacing same at high altitudes. Used\r\nlocally in California.\r\n\r\n=27. Loblolly Pine= (_Pinus tæda_) (Slash Pine, Old Field Pine, Rosemary\r\nPine, Sap Pine, Short-straw Pine). A large-sized tree, forms extensive\r\nforests. Wider-ringed, coarser, lighter, softer, with more sapwood\r\nthan the long-leaf pine, but the two are often confounded in the\r\nmarket. The more Northern tree produces lumber which is weak, brittle,\r\ncoarse-grained, and not durable, the Southern tree produces a better\r\nquality wood. Both are very resinous. This is the common lumber pine\r\nfrom Virginia to South Carolina, and is found extensively in Arkansas\r\nand Texas. Southern States, Virginia to Texas and Arkansas.\r\n\r\n=28. Norway Pine= (_Pinus resinosa_) (American Red Pine, Canadian Pine).\r\nLarge-sized tree, never forming forests, usually scattered or in\r\nsmall groves, together with white pine. Largely sapwood and hence not\r\ndurable. Heartwood reddish white, with fine, clear grain, fairly tough\r\nand elastic, not liable to warp and split. Used for building\r\nconstruction, bridges, piles, masts, and spars. Minnesota to Michigan;\r\nalso in New England to Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n=29. Short-Leaf Pine= (_Pinus echinata_) (Slash Pine, Spruce Pine,\r\nCarolina Pine, Yellow Pine, Old Field Pine, Hard Pine). A medium- to\r\nlarge-sized tree, resembling loblolly pine, often approaches in its\r\nwood the Norway pine. Heartwood orange, sapwood lighter; compact\r\nstructure, apt to be variable in appearance in cross-section. Wood\r\nusually hard, tough, strong, durable, resinous. A valuable timber\r\ntree, sometimes worked for turpentine. Used for heavy construction,\r\nshipbuilding, cars, docks, beams, ties, flooring, and house trim.\r\n_Pinus echinata_, _palustris_, and _tæda_ are very similar in\r\ncharacter, of thin wood and very difficult to distinguish one from\r\nanother. As a rule, however, _palustris_ (Long-leaf Pine) has the\r\nsmallest and most uniform growth rings, and _Pinus tæda_ (Loblolly\r\nPine) has the largest. All are apt to be bunched together in the\r\nlumber market as Southern Hard Pine. All are used for the same\r\npurposes. Short-leaf is the common lumber pine of Missouri and\r\nArkansas. North Carolina to Texas and Missouri.\r\n\r\n=30. Cuban Pine= (_Pinus cubensis_) (Slash Pine, Swamp Pine, Bastard\r\nPine, Meadow Pine). Resembles long-leaf pine, but commonly has a wider\r\nsapwood and coarser grain. Does not enter the markets to any extent.\r\nAlong the coast from South Carolina to Louisiana.\r\n\r\n=31. Pitch Pine= (_Pinus rigida_) (Torch Pine). A small to medium-sized\r\ntree. Heartwood light brown or red, sapwood yellowish white. Wood\r\nlight, soft, not strong, coarse-grained, durable, very resinous. Used\r\nlocally for lumber, fuel, and charcoal. Coast regions from New York\r\nto Georgia, and along the mountains to Kentucky.\r\n\r\n=32. Black Pine= (_Pinus murryana_) (Lodge-pole Pine, Tamarack).\r\nSmall-sized tree. Rocky Mountains and Pacific regions.\r\n\r\n=33. Jersey Pine= (_Pinus inops_ var. _Virginiana_) (Scrub Pine).\r\nSmall-sized tree. Along the coast from New York to Georgia and along\r\nthe mountains to Kentucky.\r\n\r\n=34. Gray Pine= (_Pinus divaricata_ var. _banksiana_) (Scrub Pine, Jack\r\nPine). Medium- to large-sized tree. Heartwood pale brown, rarely\r\nyellow; sapwood nearly white. Wood light, soft, not strong,\r\nclose-grained. Used for fuel, railway ties, and fence posts. In days\r\ngone by the Indians preferred this species for frames of canoes.\r\nMaine, Vermont, and Michigan to Minnesota.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          REDWOOD (See Cedar)\r\n\r\n                                SPRUCE\r\n\r\nResembles soft pine, is light, very soft, stiff, moderately strong,\r\nless resinous than pine; has no distinct heartwood, and is of whitish\r\ncolor. Used like soft pine, but also employed as resonance wood in\r\nmusical instruments and preferred for paper pulp. Spruces, like pines,\r\nform extensive forests. They are more frugal, thrive on thinner soils,\r\nand bear more shade, but usually require a more humid climate. \"Black\"\r\nand \"White\" spruce as applied by lumbermen usually refer to narrow and\r\nwide-ringed forms of black spruce (_Picea nigra_).\r\n\r\n=35. Black Spruce= (_Picea nigra_ var. _mariana_). Medium-sized tree,\r\nforms extensive forests in northwestern United States and in British\r\nAmerica; occurs scattered or in groves, especially in low lands\r\nthroughout the northern pineries. Important lumber tree in eastern\r\nUnited States. Heartwood pale, often with reddish tinge; sapwood pure\r\nwhite. Wood light, soft, not strong. Chiefly used for manufacture of\r\npaper pulp, and great quantities of this as well as _Picea alba_ are\r\nused for this purpose. Used also for sounding boards for pianos,\r\nviolins, etc. Maine to Minnesota, British America, and in the\r\nAlleghanies to North Carolina.\r\n\r\n=36. White Spruce= (_Picea canadensis_ var. _alba_). Medium- to\r\nlarge-sized tree. Heartwood light yellow; sapwood nearly white.\r\nGenerally associated with the preceding. Most abundant along streams\r\nand lakes, grows largest in Montana and forms the most important tree\r\nof the sub-arctic forest of British America. Used largely for floors,\r\njoists, doors, sashes, mouldings, and panel work, rapidly superceding\r\n_Pinus strobus_ for building purposes. It is very similar to Norway\r\npine, excels it in toughness, is rather less durable and dense, and\r\nmore liable to warp in seasoning. Northern United States from Maine to\r\nMinnesota, also from Montana to Pacific, British America.\r\n\r\n=37. White Spruce= (_Picea engelmanni_). Medium- to large-sized tree,\r\nforming extensive forests at elevations from 5,000 to 10,000 feet\r\nabove sea level; resembles the preceding, but occupies a different\r\nstation. A very important timber tree in the central and southern\r\nparts of the Rocky Mountains. Rocky Mountains from Mexico to Montana.\r\n\r\n=38. Tide-Land Spruce= (_Picea sitchensis_) (Sitka Spruce). A\r\nlarge-sized tree, forming an extensive coast-belt forest. Used\r\nextensively for all classes of cooperage and woodenware on the Pacific\r\nCoast. Along the sea-coast from Alaska to central California.\r\n\r\n=39. Red Spruce= (_Picea rubens_). Medium-sized tree, generally\r\nassociated with _Picea nigra_ and occurs scattered throughout the\r\nnorthern pineries. Heartwood reddish; sapwood lighter color,\r\nstraight-grained, compact structure. Wood light, soft, not strong,\r\nelastic, resonant, not durable when exposed. Used for flooring,\r\ncarpentry, shipbuilding, piles, posts, railway ties, paddles, oars,\r\nsounding boards, paper pulp, and musical instruments. Montana to\r\nPacific, British America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BASTARD SPRUCE\r\n\r\nSpruce or fir in name, but resembling hard pine or larch in\r\nappearance, quality and uses of its wood.\r\n\r\n=40. Douglas Spruce= (_Pseudotsuga douglasii_) (Yellow Fir, Red Fir,\r\nOregon Pine). One of the most important trees of the western United\r\nStates; grows very large in the Pacific States, to fair size in all\r\nparts of the mountains, in Colorado up to about 10,000 feet above sea\r\nlevel; forms extensive forests, often of pure growth, it is really\r\nneither a pine nor a fir. Wood very variable, usually coarse-grained\r\nand heavy, with very pronounced summer-wood. Hard and strong (\"red\"\r\nfir), but often fine-grained and light (\"yellow\" fir). It is the chief\r\ntree of Washington and Oregon, and most abundant and most valuable in\r\nBritish Columbia, where it attains its greatest size. From the plains\r\nto the Pacific Ocean, and from Mexico to British Columbia.\r\n\r\n=41. Red Fir= (_Pseudotsuga taxifolia_) (Oregon Pine, Puget Sound Pine,\r\nYellow Fir, Douglas Spruce, Red Pine). Heartwood light red or yellow\r\nin color, sapwood narrow, nearly white, comparatively free from\r\nresins, variable annual rings. Wood usually hard, strong, difficult to\r\nwork, durable, splinters easily. Used for heavy construction,\r\ndimension timber, railway ties, doors, blinds, interior finish, piles,\r\netc. One of the most important of Western trees. From the plains to\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, and from Mexico to British America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         TAMARACK (See Larch)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  YEW\r\n\r\nWood heavy, hard, extremely stiff and strong, of fine texture with a\r\npale yellow sapwood, and an orange-red heartwood; seasons well and is\r\nquite durable. Extensively used for archery bows, turner's ware, etc.\r\nThe yews form no forests, but occur scattered with other conifers.\r\n\r\n=42. Yew= (_Taxus brevifolia_). A small to medium-sized tree of the\r\nPacific region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION III\r\n\r\n                          BROAD-LEAVED TREES\r\n\r\n                      WOOD OF BROAD-LEAVED TREES\r\n\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4.

Cross-section of Oak (Magnified about\r\n    5 times).]\r\n\r\nOn a cross-section of oak, the same arrangement of pith and bark, of\r\nsapwood and heartwood, and the same disposition of the wood in\r\nwell-defined concentric or annual rings occur, but the rings are\r\nmarked by lines or rows of conspicuous pores or openings, which occupy\r\nthe greater part of the spring-wood for each ring (see Fig. 4, also\r\n6), and are, in fact the hollows of vessels through which the cut has\r\nbeen made. On the radial section or quarter-sawn board the several\r\nlayers appear as so many stripes (see Fig. 5); on the tangential\r\nsection or \"bastard\" face patterns similar to those mentioned for pine\r\nwood are observed. But while the patterns in hard pine are marked by\r\nthe darker summer-wood, and are composed of plain, alternating stripes\r\nof darker and lighter wood, the figures in oak (and other broad-leaved\r\nwoods) are due chiefly to the vessels, those of the spring-wood in oak\r\nbeing the most conspicuous (see Fig. 5). So that in an oak table, the\r\ndarker, shaded parts are the spring-wood, the lighter unicolored parts\r\nthe summer-wood. On closer examination of the smooth cross-section of\r\noak, the spring-wood part of the ring is found to be formed in great\r\npart of pores; large, round, or oval openings made by the cut through\r\nlong vessels. These are separated by a grayish and quite porous\r\ntissue (see Fig. 6, A), which continues here and there in the form of\r\nradial, often branched, patches (not the pith rays) into and through\r\nthe summer-wood to the spring-wood of the next ring. The large vessels\r\nof the spring-wood, occupying six to ten per cent of the volume of a\r\nlog in very good oak, and twenty-five per cent or more in inferior and\r\nnarrow-ringed timber, are a very important feature, since it is\r\nevident that the greater their share in the volume, the lighter and\r\nweaker the wood. They are smallest near the pith, and grow wider\r\noutward. They are wider in the stem than limb, and seem to be of\r\nindefinite length, forming open channels, in some cases probably as\r\nlong as the tree itself. Scattered through the radiating gray patches\r\nof porous wood are vessels similar to those of the spring-wood, but\r\ndecidedly smaller. These vessels are usually fewer and larger near the\r\nouter portions of the ring. Their number and size can be utilized to\r\ndistinguish the oaks classed as white oaks from those classed as black\r\nand red oaks. They are fewer and larger in red oaks, smaller but much\r\nmore numerous in white oaks. The summer-wood, except for these radial,\r\ngrayish patches, is dark colored and firm. This firm portion, divided\r\ninto bodies or strands by these patches of porous wood, and also by\r\nfine, wavy, concentric lines of short, thin-walled cells (see Fig. 6,\r\nA), consists of thin-walled fibres (see Fig. 7, B), and is the chief\r\nelement of strength in oak wood. In good white oak it forms one-half\r\nor more of the wood, if it cuts like horn, and the cut surface is\r\nshiny, and of a deep chocolate brown color. In very narrow-ringed wood\r\nand in inferior red oak it is usually much reduced in quantity as well\r\nas quality. The pith rays of the oak, unlike those of the coniferous\r\nwoods, are at least in part very large and conspicuous. (See Fig. 4;\r\ntheir height indicated by the letter _a_, and their width by the\r\nletter _b_.) The large medullary rays of oak are often twenty and more\r\ncells wide, and several hundred cell rows in height, which amount\r\ncommonly to one or more inches. These large rays are conspicuous on\r\nall sections. They appear as long, sharp, grayish lines on the\r\ncross-sections; as short, thick lines, tapering at each end, on the\r\ntangential or \"bastard\" face, and as broad, shiny bands, \"the\r\nmirrors,\" on the radial section. In addition to these coarse rays,\r\nthere is also a large number of small pith rays, which can be seen\r\nonly when magnified. On the whole, the pith rays form a much larger\r\npart of the wood than might be supposed. In specimens of good white\r\noak it has been found that they form about sixteen to twenty-five per\r\ncent of the wood.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7. Portion of the Firm Bodies of Fibres\r\n    with Two Cells of a Small Pith Ray _mr_ (Highly Magnified).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8. Isolated Fibres and Cells, _a_, four\r\n    cells of wood, parenchyma; _b_, two cells from a pith ray;\r\n    _c_, a single joint or cell of a vessel, the openings _x_\r\n    leading into its upper and lower neighbors; _d_, tracheid;\r\n    _e_, wood fibre proper.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Minute Structure\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 9. Cross-section of Basswood (Magnified).\r\n    _v_, vessels; _mr_, pith rays.]\r\n\r\nIf a well-smoothed thin disk or cross-section of oak (say\r\none-sixteenth inch thick) is held up to the light, it looks very much\r\nlike a sieve, the pores or vessels appearing as clean-cut holes. The\r\nspring-wood and gray patches are seen to be quite porous, but the firm\r\nbodies of fibres between them are dense and opaque. Examined with a\r\nmagnifier it will be noticed that there is no such regularity of\r\narrangement in straight rows as is conspicuous in pine. On the\r\ncontrary, great irregularity prevails. At the same time, while the\r\npores are as large as pin holes, the cells of the denser wood, unlike\r\nthose of pine wood, are too small to be distinguished. Studied with\r\nthe microscope, each vessel is found to be a vertical row of a great\r\nnumber of short, wide tubes, joined end to end (see Fig. 8, _c_). The\r\nporous spring-wood and radial gray tracts are partly composed of\r\nsmaller vessels, but chiefly of tracheids, like those of pine, and of\r\nshorter cells, the \"wood parenchyma,\" resembling the cells of the\r\nmedullary rays. These latter, as well as the fine concentric lines\r\nmentioned as occurring in the summer-wood, are composed entirely of\r\nshort tube-like parenchyma cells, with square or oblique ends (see\r\nFig. 8, _a_ and _b_). The wood fibres proper, which form the dark,\r\nfirm bodies referred to, are very fine, thread-like cells, one\r\ntwenty-fifth to one-tenth inch long, with a wall commonly so thick\r\nthat scarcely any empty internal space or lumen remains (see Figs. 8,\r\n_e_, and 7, B). If, instead of oak, a piece of poplar or basswood (see\r\nFig. 9) had been used in this study, the structure would have been\r\nfound to be quite different. The same kinds of cell-elements, vessels,\r\netc., are, to be sure, present, but their combination and arrangement\r\nare different, and thus from the great variety of possible\r\ncombinations results the great variety of structure and, in\r\nconsequence, of the qualities which distinguish the wood of\r\nbroad-leaved trees. The sharp distinction of sap wood and heartwood is\r\nwanting; the rings are not so clearly defined; the vessels of the\r\nwood are small, very numerous, and rather evenly scattered through the\r\nwood of the annual rings, so that the distinction of the ring almost\r\nvanishes and the medullary or pith rays in poplar can be seen, without\r\nbeing magnified, only on the radial section.\r\n\r\n\r\n         LIST OF MOST IMPORTANT BROAD-LEAVED TREES (HARDWOODS)\r\n\r\nWoods of complex and very variable structure, and therefore differing\r\nwidely in quality, behavior, and consequently in applicability to the\r\narts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               AILANTHUS\r\n\r\n=1. Ailanthus= (_Ailanthus glandulosa_). Medium to large-sized tree.\r\nWood pale yellow, hard, fine-grained, and satiny. This species\r\noriginally came from China, where it is known as the Tree of \"Heaven,\"\r\nwas introduced into the United States and planted near Philadelphia\r\nduring the 18th century, and is more ornamental than useful. It is\r\nused to some extent in cabinet work.

The wood shrinks moderately, seasons with little injury,\r\nstands well, and takes a good polish. In carpentry, ash is used for\r\nstairways, panels, etc. It is used in shipbuilding, in the\r\nconstruction of cars, wagons, etc., in the manufacture of all kinds of\r\nfarm implements, machinery, and especially of all kinds of furniture;\r\nfor cooperage, baskets, oars, tool handles, hoops, etc., etc. The\r\ntrees of the several species of ash are rapid growers, of small to\r\nmedium height with stout trunks. They form no forests, but occur\r\nscattered in almost all our broad-leaved forests.\r\n\r\n=2. White Ash= (_Fraxinus Americana_). Medium-, sometimes large-sized\r\ntree. Heartwood reddish brown, usually mottled; sapwood lighter color,\r\nnearly white. Wood heavy, hard, tough, elastic, coarse-grained,\r\ncompact structure. Annual rings clearly marked by large open pores,\r\nnot durable in contact with the soil, is straight-grained, and the\r\nbest material for oars, etc. Used for agricultural implements, tool\r\nhandles, automobile (rim boards), vehicle bodies and parts, baseball\r\nbats, interior finish, cabinet work, etc., etc. Basin of the Ohio, but\r\nfound from Maine to Minnesota and Texas.\r\n\r\n=3.

Wood heavy, hard,\r\nstrong, and coarse-grained. Ranges from New Brunswick to Florida, and\r\nwestward to Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas.\r\n\r\n=4. Black Ash= (_Fraxinus nigra_ var. _sambucifolia_) (Hoop Ash, Ground\r\nAsh). Medium-sized tree, very common, is more widely distributed than\r\nthe _Fraxinus Americana_; the wood is not so hard, but is well suited\r\nfor hoops and basketwork. Heartwood dark brown, sapwood light brown or\r\nwhite. Wood heavy, rather soft, tough and coarse-grained. Used for\r\nbarrel hoops, basketwork, cabinetwork and interior of houses. Maine to\r\nMinnesota and southward to Alabama.\r\n\r\n=5. Blue Ash= (_Fraxinus quadrangulata_). Small to medium-sized tree.\r\nHeartwood yellow, streaked with brown, sapwood a lighter color.

Basswood= (_Tilia Americana_) (Linden, Lime Tree, American Linden,\r\nLin, Bee Tree). Medium- to large-sized tree. Wood light, soft, stiff,\r\nbut not strong, of fine texture, straight and close-grained, and white\r\nto light brown color, but not durable in contact with the soil. The\r\nwood shrinks considerably in drying, works well and stands well in\r\ninterior work. It is used for cooperage, in carpentry, in the\r\nmanufacture of furniture and woodenware (both turned and carved), for\r\ntoys, also for panelling of car and carriage bodies, for agricultural\r\nimplements, automobiles, sides and backs of drawers, cigar boxes,\r\nexcelsior, refrigerators, trunks, and paper pulp. It is also largely\r\ncut for veneer and used as \"three-ply\" for boxes and chair seats. It\r\nis used for sounding boards in pianos and organs. If well seasoned and\r\npainted it stands fairly well for outside work. Common in all northern\r\nbroad-leaved forests. Found throughout the eastern United States, but\r\nreaches its greatest size in the Valley of the Ohio, becoming often\r\n130 feet in height, but its usual height is about 70 feet.\r\n\r\n=10. White Basswood= (_Tilia heterophylla_) (Whitewood). A small-sized\r\ntree. Wood in its quality and uses similar to the preceding, only it\r\nis lighter in color. Most abundant in the Alleghany region.\r\n\r\n=11. White Basswood= (_Tilia pubescens_) (Downy Linden, Small-leaved\r\nBasswood). Small-sized tree. Wood in its quality and uses similar to\r\n_Tilia Americana_. This is a Southern species which makes it way as\r\nfar north as Long Island. Is found at its best in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BEECH\r\n\r\n=12. Beech= (_Fagus ferruginea_) (Red Beech, White Beech). Medium-sized\r\ntree, common, sometimes forming forests of pure growth. Wood heavy,\r\nhard, stiff, strong, of rather coarse texture, white to light brown\r\ncolor, not durable in contact with the soil, and subject to the\r\ninroads of boring insects. Rather close-grained, conspicuous medullary\r\nrays, and when quarter-sawn and well smoothed is very beautiful. The\r\nwood shrinks and checks considerably in drying, works well and stands\r\nwell, and takes a fine polish. Beech is comparatively free from\r\nobjectionable taste, and finds a place in the manufacture of\r\ncommodities which come in contact with foodstuffs, such as lard tubs,\r\nbutter boxes and pails, and the beaters of ice cream freezers; for the\r\nlatter the persistent hardness of the wood when subjected to attrition\r\nand abrasion, while wet gives it peculiar fitness. It is an excellent\r\nmaterial for churns. Sugar hogsheads are made of beech, partly because\r\nit is a tasteless wood and partly because it has great strength. A\r\nlarge class of woodenware, including veneer plates, dishes, boxes,\r\npaddles, scoops, spoons, and beaters, which belong to the kitchen and\r\npantry, are made of this species of wood. Beech picnic plates are made\r\nby the million, a single machine turning out 75,000 a day. The wood\r\nhas a long list of miscellaneous uses and enters in a great variety of\r\ncommodities. In every region where it grows in commercial quantities\r\nit is made into boxes, baskets, and crating. Beech baskets are chiefly\r\nemployed in shipping fruit, berries, and vegetables. In Maine thin\r\nveneer of beech is made specially for the Sicily orange and lemon\r\ntrade. This is shipped in bulk and the boxes are made abroad. Beech is\r\nalso an important handle wood, although not in the same class with\r\nhickory. It is not selected because of toughness and resiliency, as\r\nhickory is, and generally goes into plane, handsaw, pail, chisel, and\r\nflatiron handles. Recent statistics show that in the production of\r\nslack cooperage staves, only two woods, red gum and pine, stood above\r\nbeech in quantity, while for heading, pine alone exceeded it. It is\r\nalso used in turnery, for shoe lasts, butcher blocks, ladder rounds,\r\netc. Abroad it is very extensively used by the carpenter, millwright,\r\nand wagon maker, in turnery and wood carving. Most abundant in the\r\nOhio and Mississippi basin, but found from Maine to Wisconsin and\r\nsouthward to Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 BIRCH\r\n\r\n=13. Cherry Birch= (_Betula lenta_) (Black Birch, Sweet Birch, Mahogany\r\nBirch, Wintergreen Birch). Medium-sized tree, very common. Wood of\r\nbeautiful reddish or yellowish brown, and much of it nicely figured,\r\nof compact structure, is straight in grain, heavy, hard, strong, takes\r\na fine polish, and considerably used as imitation of mahogany. The\r\nwood shrinks considerably in drying, works well and stands well, but\r\nis not durable in contact with the soil. The medullary rays in birch\r\nare very fine and close and not easily seen. The sweet birch is very\r\nhandsome, with satiny luster, equalling cherry, and is too costly a\r\nwood to be profitably used for ordinary purposes, but there are both\r\nhigh and low grades of birch, the latter consisting chiefly of sapwood\r\nand pieces too knotty for first class commodities. This cheap material\r\nswells the supply of box lumber, and a little of it is found wherever\r\nbirch passes through sawmills. The frequent objections against sweet\r\nbirch as box lumber and crating material are that it is hard to nail\r\nand is inclined to split. It is also used for veneer picnic plates and\r\nbutter dishes, although it is not as popular for this class of\r\ncommodity as are yellow and paper birch, maple and beech. The best\r\ngrades are largely used for furniture and cabinet work, and also for\r\ninterior finish. Maine to Michigan and to Tennessee.\r\n\r\n=14. White Birch= (_Betula populifolia_) (Gray Birch, Old Field Birch,\r\nAspen-leaved Birch). Small to medium-sized tree, least common of all\r\nthe birches. Short-lived, twenty to thirty feet high, grows very\r\nrapidly. Heartwood light brown, sapwood lighter color. Wood light,\r\nsoft, close-grained, not strong, checks badly in drying, decays\r\nquickly, not durable in contact with the soil, takes a good polish.\r\nUsed for spools, shoepegs, wood pulp, and barrel hoops. Fuel, value\r\nnot high, but burns with bright flame. Ranges from Nova Scotia and\r\nlower St. Lawrence River, southward, mostly in the coast region to\r\nDelaware, and westward through northern New England and New York to\r\nsouthern shore of Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\n=15. Yellow Birch= (_Betula lutea_) (Gray Birch, Silver Birch). Medium-\r\nto large-sized tree, very common. Heartwood light reddish brown,\r\nsapwood nearly white, close-grained, compact structure, with a satiny\r\nluster. Wood heavy, very strong, hard, tough, susceptible of high\r\npolish, not durable when exposed. Is similar to _Betula lenta_, and\r\nfinds a place in practically all kinds of woodenware. A large\r\npercentage of broom handles on the market are made of this species of\r\nwood, though nearly every other birch contributes something. It is\r\nused for veneer plates and dishes made for pies, butter, lard, and\r\nmany other commodities. Tubs and pails are sometimes made of yellow\r\nbirch provided weight is not objectionable. The wood is twice as heavy\r\nas some of the pines and cedars. Many small handles for such articles\r\nas flatirons, gimlets, augers, screw drivers, chisels, varnish and\r\npaint brushes, butcher and carving knives, etc. It is also widely used\r\nfor shipping boxes, baskets, and crates, and it is one of the\r\nstiffest, strongest woods procurable, but on account of its excessive\r\nweight it is sometimes discriminated against. It is excellent for\r\nveneer boxes, and that is probably one of the most important places it\r\nfills. Citrus fruit from northern Africa and the islands and countries\r\nof the Mediterranean is often shipped to market in boxes made of\r\nyellow birch from veneer cut in New England. The better grades are\r\nalso used for furniture and cabinet work, and the \"burls\" found on\r\nthis species are highly valued for making fancy articles, gavels, etc.\r\nIt is extensively used for turnery, buttons, spools, bobbins, wheel\r\nhubs, etc. Maine to Minnesota and southward to Tennessee.\r\n\r\n=16. Red Birch= (_Betula rubra_ var. _nigra_) (River Birch). Small to\r\nmedium-sized tree, very common. Lighter and less valuable than the\r\npreceding. Heartwood light brown, sapwood pale. Wood light, fairly\r\nstrong and close-grained. Red birch is best developed in the middle\r\nSouth, and usually grows near the banks of rivers. Its bark hangs in\r\ntatters, even worse than that of paper birch, but it is darker. In\r\nTennessee the slack coopers have found that red birch makes excellent\r\nbarrel heads and it is sometimes employed in preference to other\r\nwoods. In eastern Maryland the manufacturers of peach baskets draw\r\ntheir supplies from this wood, and substitute it for white elm in\r\nmaking the hoops or bands which stiffen the top of the basket, and\r\nprovide a fastening for the veneer which forms the sides. Red birch\r\nbends in a very satisfactory manner, which is an important point. This\r\nwood enters pretty generally into the manufacture of woodenware within\r\nits range, but statistics do not mention it by name. It is also used\r\nin the manufacture of veneer picnic plates, pie plates, butter dishes,\r\nwashboards, small handles, kitchen and pantry utensils, and ironing\r\nboards. New England to Texas and Missouri.\r\n\r\n=17. Canoe Birch= (_Betula paprifera_) (White Birch, Paper Birch). Small\r\nto medium-sized tree, sometimes forming forests, very common.\r\nHeartwood light brown tinged with red, sapwood lighter color. Wood of\r\ngood quality, but light, fairly hard and strong, tough, close-grained.\r\nSap flows freely in spring and by boiling can be made into syrup. Not\r\nas valuable as any of the preceding. Canoe birch is a northern tree,\r\neasily identified by its white trunk and its ragged bark. Large\r\nnumbers of small wooden boxes are made by boring out blocks of this\r\nwood, shaping them in lathes, and fitting lids on them. Canoe birch is\r\none of the best woods for this class of commodities, because it can be\r\nworked very thin, does not split readily, and is of pleasing color.\r\nSuch boxes, or two-piece diminutive kegs, are used as containers for\r\narticles shipped and sold in small bulk, such as tacks, small nails,\r\nand brads. Such containers are generally cylindrical and of\r\nconsiderably greater depth than diameter. Many others of nearly\r\nsimilar form are made to contain ink bottles, bottles of perfumery,\r\ndrugs, liquids, salves, lotions, and powders of many kinds. Many boxes\r\nof this pattern are used by manufacturers of pencils and crayons for\r\npacking and shipping their wares. Such boxes are made in numerous\r\nnumbers by automatic machinery. A single machine of the most improved\r\npattern will turn out 1,400 boxes an hour. After the boring and\r\nturning are done, they are smoothed by placing them into a tumbling\r\nbarrel with soapstone. It is also used for one-piece shallow trays or\r\nboxes, without lids, and used as card receivers, pin receptacles,\r\nbutter boxes, fruit platters, and contribution plates in churches. It\r\nis also the principal wood used for spools, bobbins, bowls, shoe\r\nlasts, pegs, and turnery, and is also much used in the furniture\r\ntrade. All along the northern boundary of the United States and\r\nnorthward, from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BLACK WALNUT (See Walnut)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BLUE BEECH\r\n\r\n=18. Blue Beech= (_Carpinus Caroliniana_) (Hornbeam, Water Beech,\r\nIronwood). Small-sized tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood nearly\r\nwhite. Wood very hard, heavy, strong, very stiff, of rather fine\r\ntexture, not durable in contact with the soil, shrinks and checks\r\nconsiderably in drying, but works well and stands well, and takes a\r\nfine polish. Used chiefly in turnery, for tool handles, etc. Abroad\r\nmuch used by mill-and wheelwrights. A small tree, largest in the\r\nSouthwest, but found in nearly all parts of the eastern United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BOIS D'ARC (See Osage Orange)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BUCKEYE\r\n\r\nWood light, soft, not strong, often quite tough, of fine, uniform\r\ntexture and creamy white color. It shrinks considerably in drying, but\r\nworks well and stands well. Used for woodenware, artificial limbs,\r\npaper pulp, and locally also for building construction.\r\n\r\n=19. Ohio Buckeye= (_Æsculus glabra_) (Horse Chestnut, Fetid Buckeye).\r\nSmall-sized tree, scattered, never forming forests. Heartwood white,\r\nsapwood pale brown. Wood light, soft, not strong, often quite tough\r\nand close-grained. Alleghanies, Pennsylvania to Oklahoma.\r\n\r\n=20. Sweet Buckeye= (_Æsculus octandra_ var. _flava_) (Horse Chestnut).\r\nSmall-sized tree, scattered, never forming forests. Wood in its\r\nquality and uses similar to the preceding. Alleghanies, Pennsylvania\r\nto Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BUCKTHORNE\r\n\r\n=21. Buckthorne= (_Rhanmus Caroliniana_) (Indian Cherry). Small-sized\r\ntree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood almost white. Wood light, hard,\r\nclose-grained. Does not enter the markets to any great extent. Found\r\nalong the borders of streams in rich bottom lands. Its northern limits\r\nis Long Island, where it is only a shrub; it becomes a tree only in\r\nsouthern Arkansas and adjoining regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               BUTTERNUT\r\n\r\n=22. Butternut= (_Juglans cinerea_) (White Walnut, White Mahogany,\r\nWalnut). Medium-sized tree, scattered, never forming forests. Wood\r\nvery similar to black walnut, but light, quite soft, and not strong.\r\nHeartwood light gray-brown, darkening with exposure; sapwood nearly\r\nwhite, coarse-grained, compact structure, easily worked, and\r\nsusceptible to high polish. Has similar grain to black walnut and when\r\nstained is a very good imitation. Is much used for inside work, and\r\nvery durable. Used chiefly for finishing lumber, cabinet work, boat\r\nfinish and fixtures, and for furniture. Butternut furniture is often\r\nsold as circassian walnut. Largest and most common in the Ohio basin.\r\nMaine to Minnesota and southward to Georgia and Alabama.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CATALPA\r\n\r\nThe catalpa is a tree which was planted about 25 years ago as a\r\ncommercial speculation in Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska. Its native\r\nhabitat was along the rivers Ohio and lower Wabash, and a century ago\r\nit gained a reputation for rapid growth and durability, but did not\r\ngrow in large quantities. As a railway tie, experiments have left no\r\ndoubt as to its resistance to decay; it stands abrasion as well as the\r\nwhite oak (_Quercus alba_), and is superior to it in longevity.\r\nCatalpa is a tree singularly free from destructive diseases. Wood cut\r\nfrom the living tree is one of the most durable timbers known. In\r\nspite of its light porous structure it resists the weathering\r\ninfluences and the attacks of wood-destroying fungi to a remarkable\r\ndegree. No fungus has yet been found which will grow in the dead\r\ntimber, and for fence posts this wood has no equal, lasting longer\r\nthan almost any other species of timber. The wood is rather soft and\r\ncoarse in texture, the tree is of slow growth, and the brown colored\r\nheartwood, even of very young trees, forms nearly three-quarters of\r\ntheir volume. There is only about one-quarter inch of sapwood in a\r\n9-inch tree.\r\n\r\n=23. Catalpa= (_Catalpa speciosa_ var. _bignonioides_) (Indian Bean).\r\nMedium-sized tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood nearly white. Wood\r\nlight, soft, not strong, brittle, very durable in contact with the\r\nsoil, of coarse texture. Used chiefly for railway ties, telegraph\r\npoles, and fence posts, but well suited for a great variety of uses.\r\nLower basin of the Ohio River, locally common. Extensively planted,\r\nand therefore promising to become of some importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHERRY\r\n\r\n=24. Cherry= (_Prunus serotina_) (Wild Cherry, Black Cherry, Rum\r\nCherry). Wood heavy, hard, strong, of fine texture. Sapwood yellowish\r\nwhite, heartwood reddish to brown. The wood shrinks considerably in\r\ndrying, works well and stands well, has a fine satin-like luster, and\r\ntakes a fine polish which somewhat resembles mahogany, and is much\r\nesteemed for its beauty. Cherry is chiefly used as a decorative\r\ninterior finishing lumber, for buildings, cars and boats, also for\r\nfurniture and in turnery, for musical instruments, walking sticks,\r\nlast blocks, and woodenware. It is becoming too costly for many\r\npurposes for which it is naturally well suited. The lumber-furnishing\r\ncherry of the United States, the wild black cherry, is a small to\r\nmedium-sized tree, scattered through many of the broad-leaved trees of\r\nthe western slope of the Alleghanies, but found from Michigan to\r\nFlorida, and west to Texas. Other species of this genus, as well as\r\nthe hawthornes (_Prunus cratoegus_) and wild apple (_Pyrus_), are not\r\ncommonly offered in the markets. Their wood is of the same character\r\nas cherry, often finer, but in smaller dimensions.\r\n\r\n=25. Red Cherry= (_Prunus Pennsylvanica_) (Wild Red Cherry, Bird\r\nCherry). Small-sized tree. Heartwood light brown, sapwood pale yellow.\r\nWood light, soft, and close-grained. Uses similiar to the preceding,\r\ncommon throughout the Northern States, reaching its greatest size on\r\nthe mountains of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHESTNUT\r\n\r\nThe chestnut is a long-lived tree, attaining an age of from 400 to 600\r\nyears, but trees over 100 years are usually hollow. It grows quickly,\r\nand sprouts from a chestnut stump (Coppice Chestnut) often attain a\r\nheight of 8 feet in the first year. It has a fairly cylindrical stem,\r\nand often grows to a height of 100 feet and over. Coppice chestnut,\r\nthat is, chestnut grown on an old stump, furnishes better timber for\r\nworking than chestnut grown from the nut, it is heavier, less spongy,\r\nstraighter in grain, easier to split, and stands exposure longer.\r\n\r\n=26. Chestnut= (_Castanea vulgaris_ var. _Americana_). Medium-to\r\nlarge-sized tree, never forming forests. Wood is light, moderately\r\nhard, stiff, elastic, not strong, but very durable when in contact\r\nwith the soil, of coarse texture. Sapwood light, heartwood darker\r\nbrown, and is readily distinguishable from the sapwood, which very\r\nearly turns into heartwood. It shrinks and checks considerably in\r\ndrying, works easily, stands well. The annual rings are very distinct,\r\nmedullary rays very minute and not visible to the naked eye. Used in\r\ncooperage, for cabinetwork, agricultural implements, railway ties,\r\ntelegraph poles, fence posts, sills, boxes, crates, coffins,\r\nfurniture, fixtures, foundation for veneer, and locally in heavy\r\nconstruction. Very common in the Alleghanies. Occurs from Maine to\r\nMichigan and southward to Alabama.\r\n\r\n=27. Chestnut= (_Castanea dentata_ var. _vesca_). Medium-sized tree,\r\nnever forming forests, not common. Heartwood brown color, sapwood\r\nlighter shade, coarse-grained. Wood and uses similar to the preceding.\r\nOccurs scattered along the St. Lawrence River, and even there is met\r\nwith only in small quantities.\r\n\r\n=28. Chinquapin= (_Castanea pumila_). Medium- to small-sized tree, with\r\nwood slightly heavier, but otherwise similiar to the preceding. Most\r\ncommon in Arkansas, but with nearly the same range as _Castanea\r\nvulgaris_.\r\n\r\n=29. Chinquapin= (_Castanea chrysophylla_). A medium-sized tree of the\r\nwestern ranges of California and Oregon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              COFFEE TREE\r\n\r\n=30. Coffee Tree= (_Gymnocladus dioicus_) (Coffee Nut, Stump Tree). A\r\nmedium- to large-sized tree, not common. Wood heavy, hard, strong,\r\nvery stiff, of coarse texture, and durable. Sapwood yellow, heartwood\r\nreddish brown, shrinks and checks considerably in drying, works well\r\nand stands well, and takes a fine polish. It is used to a limited\r\nextent in cabinetwork and interior finish. Pennsylvania to Minnesota\r\nand Arkansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COTTONWOOD (See Poplar)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CRAB APPLE\r\n\r\n=31. Crab Apple= (_Pyrus coronaria_) (Wild Apple, Fragrant Crab).\r\nSmall-sized tree. Heartwood reddish brown, sapwood yellow. Wood heavy,\r\nhard, not strong, close-grained. Used principally for tool handles and\r\nsmall domestic articles. Most abundant in the middle and western\r\nstates, reaches its greatest size in the valleys of the lower Ohio\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CUCUMBER TREE (See Magnolia)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DOGWOOD\r\n\r\n=32. Dogwood= (_Cornus florida_) (American Box). Small to medium-sized\r\ntree. Attains a height of about 30 feet and about 12 inches in\r\ndiameter. The heartwood is a red or pinkish color, the sapwood, which\r\nis considerable, is a creamy white. The wood has a dull surface and\r\nvery fine grain. It is valuable for turnery, tool handles, and\r\nmallets, and being so free from silex, watchmakers use small splinters\r\nof it for cleaning out the pivot holes of watches, and opticians for\r\nremoving dust from deep-seated lenses. It is also used for butchers'\r\nskewers, and shuttle blocks and wheel stock, and is suitable for\r\nturnery and inlaid work. Occurs scattered in all the broad-leaved\r\nforests of our country; very common.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  ELM\r\n\r\nWood heavy, hard, strong, elastic, very tough, moderately durable in\r\ncontact with the soil, commonly cross-grained, difficult to split and\r\nshape, warps and checks considerably in drying, but stands well if\r\nproperly seasoned. The broad sapwood whitish, heartwood light brown,\r\nboth with shades of gray and red. On split surfaces rough, texture\r\ncoarse to fine, capable of high polish. Elm for years has been the\r\nprincipal wood used in slack cooperage for barrel staves, also in the\r\nconstruction of cars, wagons, etc., in boat building, agricultural\r\nimplements and machinery, in saddlery and harness work, and\r\nparticularly in the manufacture of all kinds of furniture, where the\r\nbeautiful figures, especially those of the tangential or bastard\r\nsection, are just beginning to be appreciated. The elms are medium- to\r\nlarge-sized trees, of fairly rapid growth, with stout trunks; they\r\nform no forests of pure growth, but are found scattered in all the\r\nbroad-leaved woods of our country, sometimes forming a considerable\r\nportion of the arborescent growth.\r\n\r\n=33. White Elm= (_Ulmus Americana_) (American Elm, Water Elm). Medium-\r\nto large-sized tree. Wood in its quality and uses as stated above.\r\nCommon. Maine to Minnesota, southward to Florida and Texas.\r\n\r\n=34. Rock Elm= (_Ulmus racemosa_) (Cork Elm, Hickory Elm, White Elm,\r\nCliff Elm). Medium- to large-sized tree of rapid growth. Heartwood\r\nlight brown, often tinged with red, sapwood yellowish or greenish\r\nwhite, compact structure, fibres interlaced. Wood heavy, hard, very\r\ntough, strong, elastic, difficult to split, takes a fine polish. Used\r\nfor agricultural implements, automobiles, crating, boxes, cooperage,\r\ntool handles, wheel stock, bridge timbers, sills, interior finish,\r\nand maul heads. Fairly free from knots and has only a small quantity\r\nof sapwood. Michigan, Ohio, from Vermont to Iowa, and southward to\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\n=35. Red Elm= (_Ulmus fulva_ var. _pubescens_) (Slippery Elm, Moose\r\nElm). The red or slippery elm is not as large a tree as the white elm\r\n(_Ulmus Americana_), though it occasionally attains a height of 135\r\nfeet and a diameter of 4 feet. It grows tall and straight, and thrives\r\nin river valleys. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, tough, elastic,\r\ncommonly cross-grained, moderately durable in contact with the soil,\r\nsplits easily when green, works fairly well, and stands well if\r\nproperly handled. Careful seasoning and handling are essential for the\r\nbest results. Trees can be utilized for posts when very small. When\r\ngreen the wood rots very quickly in contact with the soil. Poles for\r\nposts should be cut in summer and peeled and dried before setting. The\r\nwood becomes very tough and pliable when steamed, and is of value for\r\nsleigh runners and for ribs of canoes and skiffs. Together with white\r\nelm (_Ulmus Americana_) it is extensively used for barrel staves in\r\nslack cooperage and also for furniture. The thick, viscous inner bark,\r\nwhich gives the tree its descriptive name, is quite palatable,\r\nslightly nutritious, and has a medicinal value. Found chiefly along\r\nwater courses. New York to Minnesota, and southward to Florida and\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\n=36. Cedar Elm= (_Ulmus crassifolia_). Medium- to small-sized tree,\r\nlocally quite common. Arkansas and Texas.\r\n\r\n=37. Winged Elm= (_Ulmus alata_) (Wahoo). Small-sized tree, locally\r\nquite common. Heartwood light brown, sapwood yellowish white. Wood\r\nheavy, hard, tough, strong, and close-grained. Arkansas, Missouri, and\r\neastern Virginia.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10. A Large Red Gum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  GUM\r\n\r\nThis general term applies to three important species of gum in the\r\nSouth, the principal one usually being distinguished as \"red\" or\r\n\"sweet\" gum (see Fig. 10). The next in importance being the \"tupelo\"\r\nor \"bay poplar,\" and the least of the trio is designated as \"black\" or\r\n\"sour\" gum (see Fig. 11). Up to the year 1900 little was known of gum\r\nas a wood for cooperage purposes, but by the continued advance in\r\nprice of the woods used, a few of the most progressive manufacturers,\r\nlooking into the future, saw that the supply of the various woods in\r\nuse was limited, that new woods would have to be sought, and gum was\r\nlooked upon as a possible substitute, owing to its cheapness and\r\nabundant supply. No doubt in the future this wood will be used to a\r\nconsiderable extent in the manufacture of both \"tight\" and \"slack\"\r\ncooperage. In the manufacture of the gum, unless the knives and saws\r\nare kept very sharp, the wood has a tendency to break out, the corners\r\nsplitting off; and also, much difficulty has been experienced in\r\nseasoning and kiln-drying.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11. A Tupelo Gum Slough.]\r\n\r\nIn the past, gum, having no marketable value, has been left standing\r\nafter logging operations, or, where the land has been cleared for\r\nfarming, the trees have been \"girdled\" and allowed to rot, and then\r\nfelled and burned as trash. Now, however, that there is a market for\r\nthis species of timber, it will be profitable to cut the gum with the\r\nother hardwoods, and this species of wood will come in for a greater\r\nshare of attention than ever before.\r\n\r\n=38. Red Gum= (_Liquidamber styraciflua_) (Sweet Gum, Hazel Pine, Satin\r\nWalnut, Liquidamber, Bilsted). The wood is about as stiff and as\r\nstrong as chestnut, rather heavy, it splits easily and is quite brash,\r\ncommonly cross-grained, of fine texture, and has a large proportion of\r\nwhitish sapwood, which decays rapidly when exposed to the weather; but\r\nthe reddish brown heartwood is quite durable, even in the ground. The\r\nexternal appearance of the wood is of fine grain and smooth, close\r\ntexture, but when broken the lines of fracture do not run with\r\napparent direction of the growth; possibly it is this unevenness of\r\ngrain which renders the wood so difficult to dry without twisting and\r\nwarping. It has little resiliency; can be easily bent when steamed,\r\nand when properly dried will hold its shape. The annual rings are not\r\ndistinctly marked, medullary rays fine and numerous. The green wood\r\ncontains much water, and consequently is heavy and difficult to float,\r\nbut when dry it is as light as basswood. The great amount of water in\r\nthe green wood, particularly in the sap, makes it difficult to season\r\nby ordinary methods without warping and twisting. It does not check\r\nbadly, is tasteless and odorless, and when once seasoned, swells and\r\nshrinks but little unless exposed to the weather. Used for boat\r\nfinish, veneers, cabinet work, furniture, fixtures, interior\r\ndecoration, shingles, paving blocks, woodenware, cooperage, machinery\r\nframes, refrigerators, and trunk slats.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Range of Red Gum\r\n\r\nRed gum is distributed from Fairfield County, Conn., to southeastern\r\nMissouri, through Arkansas and Oklahoma to the valley of the Trinity\r\nRiver in Texas, and eastward to the Atlantic coast. Its commercial\r\nrange is restricted, however, to the moist lands of the lower Ohio and\r\nMississippi basins and of the Southeastern coast. It is one of the\r\ncommonest timber trees in the hardwood bottoms and drier swamps of the\r\nSouth. It grows in mixture with ash, cottonwood and oak (see Fig. 12).\r\nIt is also found to a considerable extent on the lower ridges and\r\nslopes of the southern Appalachians, but there it does not reach\r\nmerchantable value and is of little importance. Considerable\r\ndifference is found between the growth in the upper Mississippi\r\nbottoms and that along the rivers on the Atlantic coast and on the\r\nGulf. In the latter regions the bottoms are lower, and consequently\r\nmore subject to floods and to continued overflows (see Fig. 11). The\r\nalluvial deposit is also greater, and the trees grow considerably\r\nfaster. Trees of the same diameter show a larger percentage of sapwood\r\nthere than in the upper portions of the Mississippi Valley. The\r\nMississippi Valley hardwood trees are for the most part considerably\r\nolder, and reach larger dimensions than the timber along the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Form of the Red Gum\r\n\r\nIn the best situations red gum reaches a height of 150 feet, and a\r\ndiameter of 5 feet. These dimensions, however are unusual. The stem is\r\nstraight and cylindrical, with dark, deeply-furrowed bark, and\r\nbranches often winged with corky ridges. In youth, while growing\r\nvigorously under normal conditions, it assumes a long, regular,\r\nconical crown, much resembling the form of a conifer (see Fig. 12).\r\nAfter the tree has attained its height growth, however, the crown\r\nbecomes rounded, spreading and rather ovate in shape. When growing in\r\nthe forest the tree prunes itself readily at an early period, and\r\nforms a good length of clear stem, but it branches strongly after\r\nmaking most of its height growth. The mature tree is usually forked,\r\nand the place where the forking commences determines the number of\r\nlogs in the tree or its merchantable length, by preventing cutting to\r\na small diameter in the top. On large trees the stem is often not less\r\nthan eighteen inches in diameter where the branching begins. The\r\nover-mature tree is usually broken and dry topped, with a very\r\nspreading crown, in consequence of new branches being sent out.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Tolerance of Red Gum\r\n\r\nThroughout its entire life red gum is intolerant in shade, there are\r\npractically no red seedlings under the dense forest cover of the\r\nbottom land, and while a good many may come up under the pine forest\r\non the drier uplands, they seldom develop into large trees. As a rule\r\nseedlings appear only in clearings or in open spots in the forest. It\r\nis seldom that an over-topped tree is found, for the gum dies quickly\r\nif suppressed, and is consequently nearly always a dominant or\r\nintermediate tree. In a hardwood bottom forest the timber trees are\r\nall of nearly the same age over considerable areas, and there is\r\nlittle young growth to be found in the older stands. The reason for\r\nthis is the intolerance of most of the swamp species. A scale of\r\nintolerance containing the important species, and beginning with the\r\nmost light-demanding, would run as follows: Cottonwood, sycamore, red\r\ngum, white elm, white ash, and red maple.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Demands upon Soil and Moisture\r\n\r\nWhile the red gum grows in various situations, it prefers the deep,\r\nrich soil of the hardwood bottoms, and there reaches its best\r\ndevelopment (see Fig. 10). It requires considerable soil moisture,\r\nthough it does not grow in the wetter swamps, and does not thrive on\r\ndry pine land. Seedlings, however, are often found in large numbers on\r\nthe edges of the uplands and even on the sandy pine land, but they\r\nseldom live beyond the pole stage. When they do, they form small,\r\nscrubby trees that are of little value. Where the soil is dry the tree\r\nhas a long tap root. In the swamps, where the roots can obtain water\r\neasily, the development of the tap root is poor, and it is only\r\nmoderate on the glade bottom lands, where there is considerable\r\nmoisture throughout the year, but no standing water in the summer\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Reproduction of Red Gum\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12. Second Growth Red Gum, Ash,\r\n    Cottonwood, and Sycamore.]\r\n\r\nRed gum reproduces both by seed and by sprouts (see Fig. 12). It\r\nproduces seed fairly abundantly every year, but about once in three\r\nyears there is an extremely heavy production. The tree begins to bear\r\nseed when twenty-five to thirty years old, and seeds vigorously up to\r\nan age of one hundred and fifty years, when its productive power\r\nbegins to diminish. A great part of the seed, however, is abortive.\r\nRed gum is not fastidious in regard to its germinating bed; it comes\r\nup readily on sod in old fields and meadows, on decomposing humus in\r\nthe forest, or on bare clay-loam or loamy sand soil. It requires a\r\nconsiderable degree of light, however, and prefers a moist seed bed.\r\nThe natural distribution of the seed takes place for several hundred\r\nfeet from the seed trees, the dissemination depending almost entirely\r\non the wind. A great part of the seed falls on the hardwood bottom\r\nwhen the land is flooded, and is either washed away or, if already in\r\nthe ground and germinating, is destroyed by the long-continued\r\noverflow. After germinating, the red gum seedling demands, above\r\neverything else, abundant light for its survival and development. It\r\nis for this reason that there is very little growth of red gum, either\r\nin the unculled forest or on culled land, where, as is usually the\r\ncase, a dense undergrowth of cane, briers, and rattan is present.\r\nUnder the dense underbrush of cane and briers throughout much of the\r\nvirgin forest, reproduction of any of the merchantable species is of\r\ncourse impossible. And even where the land has been logged over, the\r\nforest is seldom open enough to allow reproduction of cottonwood and\r\nred gum. Where, however, seed trees are contiguous to pastures or\r\ncleared land, scattered seedlings are found springing up in the open,\r\nand where openings occur in the forest, there are often large numbers\r\nof red gum seedlings, the reproduction generally occurring in groups.\r\nBut over the greater part of the Southern hardwood bottom land forest\r\nreproduction is very poor. The growth of red gum during the early part\r\nof its life, and up to the time it reaches a diameter of eight inches\r\nbreast-high, is extremely rapid, and, like most of the intolerant\r\nspecies, it attains its height growth at an early period. Gum sprouts\r\nreadily from the stump, and the sprouts surpass the seedlings in rate\r\nof height growth for the first few years, but they seldom form large\r\ntimber trees. Those over fifty years of age seldom sprout. For this\r\nreason sprout reproduction is of little importance in the forest. The\r\nprincipal requirements of red gum, then, are a moist, fairly rich soil\r\nand good exposure to light. Without these it will not reach its best\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13. A Cypress Slough in the Dry Season.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Second-Growth Red Gum\r\n\r\nSecond-growth red gum occurs to any considerable extent only on land\r\nwhich has been thoroughly cleared. Throughout the South there is a\r\ngreat deal of land which was in cultivation before the Civil War, but\r\nwhich during the subsequent period of industrial depression was\r\nabandoned and allowed to revert to forest. These old fields now mostly\r\ncovered with second-growth forest, of which red gum forms an\r\nimportant part (see Fig. 12). Frequently over fifty per cent of the\r\nstand consists of this species, but more often, and especially on the\r\nAtlantic coast, the greater part is of cottonwood or ash. These stands\r\nare very dense, and the growth is extremely rapid. Small stands of\r\nyoung growth are also often found along the edges of cultivated\r\nfields. In the Mississippi Valley the abandoned fields on which young\r\nstands have sprung up are for the most part being rapidly cleared\r\nagain. The second growth here is considered of little value in\r\ncomparison with the value of the land for agricultural purposes. In\r\nmany cases, however, the farm value of the land is not at present\r\nsufficient to make it profitable to clear it, unless the timber cut\r\nwill at least pay for the operation. There is considerable land upon\r\nwhich the second growth will become valuable timber within a few\r\nyears. Such land should not be cleared until it is possible to utilize\r\nthe timber.\r\n\r\n=39. Tupelo Gum= (_Nyssa aquatica_) (Bay Poplar, Swamp Poplar, Cotton\r\nGum, Hazel Pine, Circassian Walnut, Pepperidge, Nyssa). The close\r\nsimilarity which exists between red and tupelo gum, together with the\r\nfact that tupelo is often cut along with red gum, and marketed with\r\nthe sapwood of the latter, makes it not out of place to give\r\nconsideration to this timber. The wood has a fine, uniform texture, is\r\nmoderately hard and strong, is stiff, not elastic, very tough and hard\r\nto split, but easy to work with tools. Tupelo takes glue, paint, or\r\nvarnish well, and absorbs very little of the material. In this respect\r\nit is equal to yellow poplar and superior to cottonwood. The wood is\r\nnot durable in contact with ground, and requires much care in\r\nseasoning. The distinction between the heartwood and sapwood of this\r\nspecies is marked. The former varies in color from a dull gray to a\r\ndull brown; the latter is whitish or light yellow like that of poplar.\r\nThe wood is of medium weight, about thirty-two pounds per cubic foot\r\nwhen dry, or nearly that of red gum and loblolly pine. After\r\nseasoning it is difficult to distinguish the better grades of sapwood\r\nfrom poplar. Owing to the prejudice against tupelo gum, it was until\r\nrecently marketed under such names as bay poplar, swamp poplar, nyssa,\r\ncotton gum, circassian walnut, and hazel pine. Since it has become\r\nevident that the properties of the wood fit it for many uses, the\r\ndemand for tupelo has largely increased, and it is now taking rank\r\nwith other standard woods under its rightful name. Heretofore the\r\nquality and usefulness of this wood were greatly underestimated, and\r\nthe difficulty of handling it was magnified. Poor success in seasoning\r\nand kiln-drying was laid to defects of the wood itself, when, as a\r\nmatter of fact, the failures were largely due to the absence of proper\r\nmethods in handling. The passing of this prejudice against tupelo is\r\ndue to a better understanding of the characteristics and uses of the\r\nwood. Handled in the way in which its particular character demands,\r\ntupelo is a wood of much value.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Uses of Tupelo Gum\r\n\r\nTupelo gum is now used in slack cooperage, principally for heading. It\r\nis used extensively for house flooring and inside finishing, such as\r\nmouldings, door jambs, and casings. A great deal is now shipped to\r\nEuropean countries, where it is highly valued for different classes of\r\nmanufacture. Much of the wood is used in the manufacture of boxes,\r\nsince it works well upon rotary veneer machines. There is also an\r\nincreasing demand for tupelo for laths, wooden pumps, violin and organ\r\nsounding boards, coffins, mantelwork, conduits and novelties. It is\r\nalso used in the furniture trade for backing, drawers, and panels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Range of Tupelo Gum\r\n\r\nTupelo occurs throughout the coastal region of the Atlantic States,\r\nfrom southern Virginia to northern Florida, through the Gulf States to\r\nthe valley of the Nueces River in Texas, through Arkansas and southern\r\nMissouri to western Kentucky and Tennessee, and to the valley of the\r\nlower Wabash River. Tupelo is being extensively milled at present only\r\nin the region adjacent to Mobile Ala., and in southern and central\r\nLouisiana, where it occurs in large merchantable quantities, attaining\r\nits best development in the former locality. The country in this\r\nlocality is very swampy (see Fig. 11), and within a radius of one\r\nhundred miles tupelo gum is one of the principal timber trees. It\r\ngrows only in the swamps and wetter situations (see Fig. 11), often in\r\nmixture with cypress, and in the rainy season it stands in from two to\r\ntwenty feet of water.\r\n\r\n=40. Black Gum= (_Nyssa sylvatica_) (Sour Gum). Black gum is not cut to\r\nmuch extent, owing to its less abundant supply and poorer quality, but\r\nis used for repair work on wagons, for boxes, crates, wagon hubs,\r\nrollers, bowls, woodenware, and for cattle yokes and other purposes\r\nwhich require a strong, non-splitting wood. Heartwood is light brown\r\nin color, often nearly white; sapwood hardly distinguishable, fine\r\ngrain, fibres interwoven. Wood is heavy, not hard, difficult to work,\r\nstrong, very tough, checks and warps considerably in drying, not\r\ndurable. It is distributed from Maine to southern Ontario, through\r\ncentral Michigan to southeastern Missouri, southward to the valley of\r\nthe Brazos River in Texas, and eastward to the Kissimmee River and\r\nTampa Bay in Florida. It is found in the swamps and hardwood bottoms,\r\nbut is more abundant and of better size on the slightly higher ridges\r\nand hummocks in these swamps, and on the mountain slopes in the\r\nsouthern Alleghany region. Though its range is greater than that of\r\neither red or tupelo gum, it nowhere forms an important part of the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HACKBERRY\r\n\r\n=41. Hackberry= (_Celtis occidentalis_) (Sugar Berry, Nettle Tree). The\r\nwood is handsome, heavy, hard, strong, quite tough, of moderately fine\r\ntexture, and greenish or yellowish color, shrinks moderately, works\r\nwell and stands well, and takes a good polish. Used to some extent in\r\ncooperage, and in the manufacture of cheap furniture. Medium- to\r\nlarge-sized tree, locally quite common, largest in the lower\r\nMississippi Valley. Occurs in nearly all parts of the eastern United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                HICKORY\r\n\r\nThe hickories of commerce are exclusively North American and some of\r\nthem are large and beautiful trees of 60 to 70 feet or more in height.\r\nThey are closely allied to the walnut, and the wood is very like\r\nwalnut in grain and color, though of a somewhat darker brown. It is\r\none of the finest of American hardwoods in point of strength; in\r\ntoughness it is superior to ash, rather coarse in texture, smooth and\r\nof straight grain, very heavy and strong as well as elastic and\r\ntenacious, but decays rapidly, especially the sapwood when exposed to\r\ndamp and moisture, and is very liable to attack from worms and boring\r\ninsects. The cross-section of hickory is peculiar, the annual rings\r\nappear like fine lines instead of like the usual pores, and the\r\nmedullary rays, which are also very fine but distinct, in crossing\r\nthese form a peculiar web-like pattern which is one of the\r\ncharacteristic differences between hickory and ash. Hickory is rarely\r\nsubjected to artificial treatment, but there is this curious fact in\r\nconnection with the wood, that, contrary to most other woods, creosote\r\nis only with difficulty injected into the sap, although there is no\r\ndifficulty in getting it into the heartwood. It dries slowly, shrinks\r\nand checks considerably in seasoning; is not durable in contact with\r\nthe soil or if exposed. Hickory excels as wagon and carriage stock,\r\nfor hoops in cooperage, and is extensively used in the manufacture of\r\nimplements and machinery, for tool handles, timber pins, harness work,\r\ndowel pins, golf clubs, and fishing rods. The hickories are tall trees\r\nwith slender stems, never forming forests, occasionally small groves,\r\nbut usually occur scattered among other broad-leaved trees in suitable\r\nlocalities. The following species all contribute more or less to the\r\nhickory of the markets:\r\n\r\n=42. Shagbark Hickory= (_Hicoria ovata_) (Shellbark Hickory, Scalybark\r\nHickory). A medium- to large-sized tree, quite common; the favorite\r\namong the hickories. Heartwood light brown, sapwood ivory or\r\ncream-colored. Wood close-grained, compact structure, annual rings\r\nclearly marked. Very hard, heavy, strong, tough, and flexible, but not\r\ndurable in contact with the soil or when exposed. Used for\r\nagricultural implements, wheel runners, tool handles, vehicle parts,\r\nbaskets, dowel pins, harness work, golf clubs, fishing rods, etc. Best\r\ndeveloped in the Ohio and Mississippi basins; from Lake Ontario to\r\nTexas, Minnesota to Florida.\r\n\r\n=43. Mockernut Hickory= (_Hicoria alba_) (Black Nut Hickory, Black\r\nHickory, Bull Nut Hickory, Big Bud Hickory, White Heart Hickory). A\r\nmedium- to large-sized tree. Wood in its quality and uses similar to\r\nthe preceding. Its range is the same as that of _Hicoria ovata_.\r\nCommon, especially in the South.\r\n\r\n=44. Pignut Hickory= (_Hicoria glabra_) (Brown Hickory, Black Hickory,\r\nSwitchbud Hickory). A medium- to large-sized tree. Heavier and\r\nstronger than any of the preceding. Heartwood light to dark brown,\r\nsapwood nearly white. Abundant, all eastern United States.\r\n\r\n=45. Bitternut Hickory= (_Hicoria minima_) (Swamp Hickory). A\r\nmedium-sized tree, favoring wet localities. Heartwood light brown,\r\nsapwood lighter color. Wood in its quality and uses not so valuable as\r\n_Hicoria ovata_, but is used for the same purposes. Abundant, all\r\neastern United States.\r\n\r\n=46. Pecan= (_Hicoria pecan_) (Illinois Nut). A large tree, very common\r\nin the fertile bottoms of the western streams. Indiana to Nebraska and\r\nsouthward to Louisiana and Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 HOLLY\r\n\r\n=47. Holly= (_Ilex opaca_). Small to medium-sized tree. Wood of medium\r\nweight, hard, strong, tough, of exceedingly fine grain, closer in\r\ntexture than most woods, of white color, sometimes almost as white as\r\nivory; requires great care in its treatment to preserve the whiteness\r\nof the wood. It does not readily absorb foreign matter. Much used by\r\nturners and for all parts of musical instruments, for handles on whips\r\nand fancy articles, draught-boards, engraving blocks, cabinet work,\r\netc. The wood is often dyed black and sold as ebony; works well and\r\nstands well. Most abundant in the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf\r\nStates, but occurring eastward to Massachusetts and north to Indiana.\r\n\r\n=48. Holly= (_Ilex monticolo_) (Mountain Holly). Small-sized tree. Wood\r\nin its quality and uses similar to the preceding, but is not very\r\ngenerally known. It is found in the Catskill Mountains and extends\r\nsouthward along the Alleghanies as far as Alabama.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     HORSE CHESTNUT (See Buckeye)\r\n\r\n\r\n                               IRONWOOD\r\n\r\n=49. Ironwood= (_Ostrya Virginiana_) (Hop Hornbeam, Lever Wood).\r\nSmall-sized tree, common. Heartwood light brown tinged with red,\r\nsapwood nearly white. Wood heavy, tough, exceedingly close-grained,\r\nvery strong and hard, durable in contact with the soil, and will take\r\na fine polish. Used for small articles like levers, handles of tools,\r\nmallets, etc. Ranges throughout the United States east of the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LAUREL\r\n\r\n=50. Laurel= (_Umbellularia Californica_) (Myrtle). A Western tree,\r\nproduces timber of light brown color of great size and beauty, and is\r\nvery valuable for cabinet and inside work, as it takes a fine polish.\r\nCalifornia and Oregon, coast range of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                LOCUST\r\n\r\n=51. Black Locust= (_Robinia pseudacacia_) (Locust, Yellow Locust,\r\nAcacia). Small to medium-sized tree. Wood very heavy, hard, strong,\r\nand tough, rivalling some of the best oak in this latter quality. The\r\nwood has great torsional strength, excelling most of the soft woods in\r\nthis respect, of coarse texture, close-grained and compact structure,\r\ntakes a fine polish. Annual rings clearly marked, very durable in\r\ncontact with the soil, shrinks and checks considerably in drying, the\r\nvery narrow sapwood greenish yellow, the heartwood brown, with shades\r\nof red and green. Used for wagon hubs, trenails or pins, but\r\nespecially for railway ties, fence posts, and door sills. Also used\r\nfor boat parts, turnery, ornamentations, and locally for construction.\r\nAbroad it is much used for furniture and farming implements and also\r\nin turnery. At home in the Alleghany Mountains, extensively planted,\r\nespecially in the West.\r\n\r\n=52. Honey Locust= (_Gleditschia triacanthos_) (Honey Shucks, Locust,\r\nBlack Locust, Brown Locust, Sweet Locust, False Acacia, Three-Thorned\r\nAcacia). A medium-sized tree. Wood heavy, hard, strong, tough, durable\r\nin contact with the soil, of coarse texture, susceptible to a good\r\npolish. The narrow sapwood yellow, the heartwood brownish red. So far,\r\nbut little appreciated except for fences and fuel. Used to some extent\r\nfor wheel hubs, and locally in rough construction. Found from\r\nPennsylvania to Nebraska, and southward to Florida and Texas; locally\r\nquite abundant.\r\n\r\n=53. Locust= (_Robinia viscosa_) (Clammy Locust). Usually a shrub five\r\nor six feet high, but known to reach a height of 40 feet in the\r\nmountains of North Carolina, with the habit of a tree. Wood light\r\nbrown, heavy, hard, and close-grained. Not used to much extent in\r\nmanufacture. Range same as the preceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MAGNOLIA\r\n\r\n=54. Magnolia= (_Magnolia glauca_) (Swamp Magnolia, Small Magnolia,\r\nSweet Bay, Beaver Wood). Small-sized tree. Heartwood reddish brown,\r\nsap wood cream white. Sparingly used in manufacture. Ranges from Essex\r\nCounty, Mass., to Long Island, N. Y., from New Jersey to Florida, and\r\nwest in the Gulf region to Texas.\r\n\r\n=55. Magnolia= (_Magnolia tripetala_) (Umbrella Tree). A small-sized\r\ntree. Wood in its quality similiar to the preceding. It may be easily\r\nrecognized by its great leaves, twelve to eighteen inches long, and\r\nfive to eight inches broad. This species as well as the preceding is\r\nan ornamental tree. Ranges from Pennsylvania southward to the Gulf.\r\n\r\n=56. Cucumber Tree= (_Magnolia accuminata_) (Tulip-wood, Poplar).\r\nMedium- to large-sized tree. Heartwood yellowish brown, sapwood almost\r\nwhite. Wood light, soft, satiny, close-grained, durable in contact\r\nwith the soil, resembling and sometimes confounded with tulip tree\r\n(_Liriodendron tulipifera_) in the markets. The wood shrinks\r\nconsiderably, but seasons without much injury, and works and stands\r\nwell. It bends readily when steamed, and takes stain and paint well.\r\nUsed in cooperage, for siding, for panelling and finishing lumber in\r\nhouse, car and shipbuilding, etc., also in the manufacture of toys,\r\nculinary woodenware, and backing for drawers. Most common in the\r\nsouthern Alleghanies, but distributed from western New York to\r\nsouthern Illinois, south through central Kentucky and Tennessee to\r\nAlabama, and throughout Arkansas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 MAPLE\r\n\r\nWood heavy, hard, strong, stiff, and tough, of fine texture,\r\nfrequently wavy-grained, this giving rise to \"curly\" and \"blister\"\r\nfigures which are much admired. Not durable in the ground, or when\r\nexposed. Maple is creamy white, with shades of light brown in the\r\nheartwood, shrinks moderately, seasons, works, and stands well, wears\r\nsmoothly, and takes a fine polish. The wood is used in cooperage, and\r\nfor ceiling, flooring, panelling, stairway, and other finishing lumber\r\nin house, ship, and car construction. It is used for the keels of\r\nboats and ships, in the manufacture of implements and machinery, but\r\nespecially for furniture, where entire chamber sets of maple rival\r\nthose of oak. Maple is also used for shoe lasts and other form blocks;\r\nfor shoe pegs; for piano actions, school apparatus, for wood type in\r\nshow bill printing, tool handles, in wood carving, turnery, and scroll\r\nwork, in fact it is one of our most useful woods. The maples are\r\nmedium-sized trees, of fairly rapid growth, sometimes form forests,\r\nand frequently constitute a large proportion of the arborescent\r\ngrowth. They grow freely in parts of the Northern Hemisphere, and are\r\nparticularly luxuriant in Canada and the northern portions of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n=57. Sugar Maple= (_Acer saccharum_) (Hard Maple, Rock Maple). Medium-\r\nto large-sized tree, very common, forms considerable forests, and is\r\nespecially esteemed. The wood is close-grained, heavy, fairly hard and\r\nstrong, of compact structure. Heartwood brownish, sapwood lighter\r\ncolor; it can be worked to a satin-like surface and take a fine\r\npolish, it is not durable if exposed, and requires a good deal of\r\nseasoning. Medullary rays small but distinct. The \"curly\" or \"wavy\"\r\nvarieties furnish wood of much beauty, the peculiar contortions of the\r\ngrain called \"bird's eye\" being much sought after, and used as veneer\r\nfor panelling, etc. It is used in all good grades of furniture,\r\ncabinetmaking, panelling, interior finish, and turnery; it is not\r\nliable to warp and twist. It is also largely used for flooring, for\r\nrollers for wringers and mangling machines, for which there is a large\r\nand increasing demand. The peculiarity known as \"bird's eye,\" and\r\nwhich causes a difficulty in working the wood smooth, owing to the\r\nlittle pieces like knots lifting up, is supposed to be due to the\r\naction of boring insects. Its resistance to compression across the\r\ngrain is higher than that of most other woods. Ranges from Maine to\r\nMinnesota, abundant, with birch, in the region of the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\n=58. Red Maple= (_Acer rubrum_) (Swamp Maple, Soft Maple, Water Maple).\r\nMedium-sized tree. Like the preceding but not so valuable. Scattered\r\nalong water-courses and other moist localities. Abundant. Maine to\r\nMinnesota, southward to northern Florida.\r\n\r\n=59. Silver Maple= (_Acer saccharinum_) (Soft Maple, White Maple,\r\nSilver-Leaved Maple). Medium- to large-sized tree, common. Wood\r\nlighter, softer, and inferior to _Acer saccharum_, and usually offered\r\nin small quantities and held separate in the markets. Heartwood\r\nreddish brown, sapwood ivory white, fine-grained, compact structure.\r\nFibres sometimes twisted, weaved, or curly. Not durable. Used in\r\ncooperage for woodenware, turnery articles, interior decorations and\r\nflooring. Valley of the Ohio, but occurs from Maine to Dakota and\r\nsouthward to Florida.\r\n\r\n=60. Broad-Leaved Maple= (_Acer macrophyllum_) (Oregon Maple).\r\nMedium-sized tree, forms considerable forests, and, like the preceding\r\nhas a lighter, softer, and less valuable wood than _Acer saccharum_.\r\nPacific Coast regions.\r\n\r\n=61. Mountain Maple= (_Acer spicatum_). Small-sized tree. Heartwood pale\r\nreddish brown, sapwood lighter color. Wood light, soft, close-grained,\r\nand susceptible of high polish. Ranges from lower St. Lawrence River\r\nto northern Minnesota and regions of the Saskatchewan River; south\r\nthrough the Northern States and along the Appalachian Mountains to\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\n=62. Ash-Leaved Maple= (_Acer negundo_) (Box Elder). Medium- to\r\nlarge-sized tree. Heartwood creamy white, sapwood nearly white. Wood\r\nlight, soft, close-grained, not strong. Used for woodenware and paper\r\npulp. Distributed across the continent, abundant throughout the\r\nMississippi Valley along banks of streams and borders of swamps.\r\n\r\n=63. Striped Maple= (_Acer Pennsylvanicum_) (Moose-wood). Small-sized\r\ntree. Produces a very white wood much sought after for inlaid and for\r\ncabinet work. Wood is light, soft, close-grained, and takes a fine\r\npolish. Not common. Occurs from Pennsylvania to Minnesota.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MULBERRY\r\n\r\n=64. Red Mulberry= (_Morus rubra_). A small-sized tree. Wood moderately\r\nheavy, fairly hard and strong, rather tough, of coarse texture, very\r\ndurable in contact with the soil. The sapwood whitish, heartwood\r\nyellow to orange brown, shrinks and checks considerably in drying,\r\nworks well and stands well. Used in cooperage and locally in\r\nconstruction, and in the manufacture of farm implements. Common in the\r\nOhio and Mississippi Valleys, but widely distributed in the eastern\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MYRTLE (See Laurel)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  OAK\r\n\r\nWood very variable, usually very heavy and hard, very strong and\r\ntough, porous, and of coarse texture. The sapwood whitish, the\r\nheartwood \"oak\" to reddish brown. It shrinks and checks badly, giving\r\ntrouble in seasoning, but stands well, is durable, and little subject\r\nto the attacks of boring insects. Oak is used for many purposes, and\r\nis the chief wood used for tight cooperage; it is used in\r\nshipbuilding, for heavy construction, in carpentry, in furniture, car\r\nand wagon work, turnery, and even in woodcarving. It is also used in\r\nall kinds of farm implements, mill machinery, for piles and wharves,\r\nrailway ties, etc., etc. The oaks are medium- to large-sized trees,\r\nforming the predominant part of a large proportion of our\r\nbroad-leaved forests, so that these are generally termed \"oak\r\nforests,\" though they always contain considerable proportion of other\r\nkinds of trees. Three well-marked kinds--white, red, and live oak--are\r\ndistinguished and kept separate in the markets. Of the two principal\r\nkinds \"white oak\" is the stronger, tougher, less porous, and more\r\ndurable. \"Red oak\" is usually of coarser texture, more porous, often\r\nbrittle, less durable, and even more troublesome in seasoning than\r\nwhite oak. In carpentry and furniture work red oak brings the same\r\nprice at present as white oak. The red oaks everywhere accompany the\r\nwhite oaks, and, like the latter, are usually represented by several\r\nspecies in any given locality. \"Live oak,\" once largely employed in\r\nshipbuilding, possesses all the good qualities, except that of size,\r\nof white oak, even to a greater degree. It is one of the heaviest,\r\nhardest, toughest, and most durable woods of this country. In\r\nstructure it resembles the red oak, but is less porous.\r\n\r\n=65.

Widely planted in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              YELLOW WOOD\r\n\r\n=116. Yellow Wood= (_Cladrastis lutea_) (Virgilia). A small to\r\nmedium-sized tree. Wood yellow to pale brown, heavy, hard,\r\nclose-grained and strong. Not used to much extent in manufacturing.\r\nNot common. Found principally on the limestone cliffs of Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, and North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION IV\r\n\r\n            GRAIN, COLOR, ODOR, WEIGHT, AND FIGURE IN WOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DIFFERENT GRAINS OF WOOD\r\n\r\nThe terms \"fine-grained,\" \"coarse-grained,\" \"straight-grained,\" and\r\n\"cross-grained\" are frequently applied in the trade. In common usage,\r\nwood is coarse-grained if its annual rings are wide; fine-grained if\r\nthey are narrow. In the finer wood industries a fine-grained wood is\r\ncapable of high polish, while a coarse-grained wood is not, so that in\r\nthis latter case the distinction depends chiefly on hardness, and in\r\nthe former on an accidental case of slow or rapid growth. Generally if\r\nthe direction of the wood fibres is parallel to the axis of the stem\r\nor limb in which they occur, the wood is straight-grained; but in many\r\ncases the course of the fibres is spiral or twisted around the tree\r\n(as shown in Fig. 15), and sometimes commonly in the butts of gum and\r\ncypress, the fibres of several layers are oblique in one direction,\r\nand those of the next series of layers are oblique in the opposite\r\ndirection. (As shown in Fig. 16 the wood is cross or twisted grain.)\r\nWavy-grain in a tangential plane as seen on the radial section is\r\nillustrated in Fig. 17, which represents an extreme case observed in\r\nbeech. This same form also occurs on the radial plane, causing the\r\ntangential section to appear wavy or in transverse folds.\r\n\r\nWhen wavy grain is fine (_i.e._, the folds or ridges small but\r\nnumerous) it gives rise to the \"curly\" structure frequently seen in\r\nmaple. Ordinarily, neither wavy, spiral, nor alternate grain is\r\nvisible on the cross-section; its existence often escapes the eye even\r\non smooth, longitudinal faces in the sawed material, so that the only\r\nguide to their discovery lies in splitting the wood in two, in the two\r\nnormal plains.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15. Spiral Grain. Season checks, after\r\n    removal of bark, indicate the direction of the fibres or\r\n    grain of the wood.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 16. Alternating Spiral Grain in Cypress.\r\n    Side and end view of same piece. When the bark was at _o_,\r\n    the grain of this piece was straight. From that time, each\r\n    year it grew more oblique in one direction, reaching a climax\r\n    at _a_, and then turned back in the opposite direction. These\r\n    alternations were repeated periodically, the bark sharing in\r\n    these changes.]\r\n\r\nGenerally the surface of the wood under the bark, and therefore also\r\nthat of any layer in the interior, is not uniform and smooth, but is\r\nchannelled and pitted by numerous depressions, which differ greatly in\r\nsize and form. Usually, any one depression or elevation is restricted\r\nto one or few annual layers (_i.e._, seen only in one or few rings)\r\nand is then lost, being compensated (the surface at the particular\r\nspot evened up) by growth. In some woods, however, any depression or\r\nelevation once attained grows from year to year and reaches a maximum\r\nsize, which is maintained for many years, sometimes throughout life.\r\nIn maple, where this tendency to preserve any particular contour is\r\nvery great, the depressions and elevations are usually small\r\n(commonly less than one-eighth inch) but very numerous.\r\n\r\nOn tangent boards of such wood, the sections, pits, and prominences\r\nappear as circlets, and give rise to the beautiful \"bird's eye\" or\r\n\"landscape\" structure. Similiar structures in the burls of black ash,\r\nmaple, etc., are frequently due to the presence of dormant buds, which\r\ncause the surface of all the layers through which they pass to be\r\ncovered by small conical elevations, whose cross-sections on the sawed\r\nboard appear as irregular circlets or islets, each with a dark speck,\r\nthe section of the pith or \"trace\" of the dormant bud in the center.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 17. Wavy Grain in Beech (_after\r\n    Nordlinger_).]\r\n\r\nIn the wood of many broad-leaved trees the wood fibres are much longer\r\nwhen full grown than when they are first formed in the cambium or\r\ngrowing zone. This causes the tips of each fibre to crowd in between\r\nthe fibres above and below, and leads to an irregular interlacement of\r\nthese fibres, which adds to the toughness, but reduces the\r\ncleavability of the wood. At the juncture of the limb and stem the\r\nfibres on the upper and lower sides of the limb behave differently.\r\nOn the lower side they run from the stem into the limb, forming an\r\nuninterrupted strand or tissue and a perfect union. On the upper side\r\nthe fibres bend aside, are not continuous into the limb, and hence the\r\nconnection is not perfect (see Fig. 18). Owing to this arrangement of\r\nthe fibres, the cleft made in splitting never runs into the knot if\r\nstarted on the side above the limb, but is apt to enter the knot if\r\nstarted below, a fact well understood in woodcraft. When limbs die,\r\ndecay, and break off, the remaining stubs are surrounded, and may\r\nfinally be covered by the growth of the trunk and thus give rise to\r\nthe annoying \"dead\" or \"loose\" knots.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 18. Section of Wood showing Position of\r\n    the Grain at Base of a Limb. P, pith of both stem and limb;\r\n    1-7, seven yearly layers of wood; _a_, _b_, knot or basal\r\n    part of a limb which lived for four years, then died and\r\n    broke off near the stem, leaving the part to the left of _a_,\r\n    _b_, a \"sound\" knot, the part to the right a \"dead\" knot,\r\n    which would soon be entirely covered by the growing stem.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        COLOR AND ODOR OF WOOD\r\n\r\nColor, like structure, lends beauty to the wood, aids in its\r\nidentification, and is of great value in the determination of its\r\nquality. If we consider only the heartwood, the black color of the\r\npersimmon, the dark brown of the walnut, the light brown of the white\r\noaks, the reddish brown of the red oaks, the yellowish white of the\r\ntulip and poplars, the brownish red of the redwood and cedars, the\r\nyellow of the papaw and sumac, are all reliable marks of distinction\r\nand color. Together with luster and weight, they are only too often\r\nthe only features depended upon in practice. Newly formed wood, like\r\nthat of the outer few rings, has but little color. The sapwood\r\ngenerally is light, and the wood of trees which form no heartwood\r\nchanges but little, except when stained by forerunners of disease.\r\n\r\nThe different tints of colors, whether the brown of oak, the orange\r\nbrown of pine, the blackish tint of walnut, or the reddish cast of\r\ncedar, are due to pigments, while the deeper shade of the summer-wood\r\nbands in pine, cedar, oak, or walnut is due to the fact that the wood\r\nbeing denser, more of the colored wood substance occurs on a given\r\nspace, _i.e._, there is more colored matter per square inch. Wood is\r\ntranslucent, a thin disk of pine permitting light to pass through\r\nquite freely. This translucency affects the luster and brightness of\r\nlumber.\r\n\r\nWhen lumber is attacked by fungi, it becomes more opaque, loses its\r\nbrightness, and in practice is designated \"dead,\" in distinction to\r\n\"live\" or bright timber. Exposure to air darkens all wood; direct\r\nsunlight and occasional moistening hasten this change, and cause it to\r\npenetrate deeper. Prolonged immersion has the same effect, pine wood\r\nbecoming a dark gray, while oak changes to a blackish brown.\r\n\r\nOdor, like color, depends on chemical compounds, forming no part of\r\nthe wood substance itself. Exposure to weather reduces and often\r\nchanges the odor, but a piece of long-leaf pine, cedar, or camphor\r\nwood exhales apparently as much odor as ever when a new surface is\r\nexposed. Heartwood is more odoriferous than sapwood. Many kinds of\r\nwood are distinguished by strong and peculiar odors. This is\r\nespecially the case with camphor, cedar, pine, oak, and mahogany, and\r\nthe list would comprise every kind of wood in use were our sense of\r\nsmell developed in keeping with its importance.\r\n\r\nDecomposition is usually accompanied by pronounced odors. Decaying\r\npoplar emits a disagreeable odor, while red oak often becomes\r\nfragrant, its smell resembling that of heliotrope.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            WEIGHT OF WOOD\r\n\r\nA small cross-section of wood (as in Fig. 19) dropped into water\r\nsinks, showing that the substance of which wood fibre or wood is built\r\nup is heavier than water. By immersing the wood successively in\r\nheavier liquids, until we find a liquid in which it does not sink, and\r\ncomparing the weight of the same with water, we find that wood\r\nsubstance is about 1.6 times as heavy as water, and that this is as\r\ntrue of poplar as of oak or pine.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 19. Cross-section of a Group of Wood\r\n    Fibres (Highly Magnified.)]\r\n\r\nSeparating a single cell (as shown in Fig. 20, _a_), drying and then\r\ndropping it into water, it floats. The air-filled cell cavity or\r\ninterior reduces its weight, and, like an empty corked bottle, it\r\nweighs less than the water. Soon, however, water soaks into the cell,\r\nwhen it fills up and sinks. Many such cells grown together, as in a\r\nblock of wood, when all or most of them are filled with water, will\r\nfloat as long as the majority of them are empty or only partially\r\nfilled. This is why a green, sappy pine pole soon sinks in \"driving\"\r\n(floating down stream). Its cells are largely filled before it is\r\nthrown in, and but little additional water suffices to make its weight\r\ngreater than that of the water. In a good-sized white pine log,\r\ncomposed chiefly of empty cells (heartwood), the water requires a very\r\nlong time to fill up the cells (five years would not suffice to fill\r\nthem all), and therefore the log may float for many months. When the\r\nwall of the wood fibre is very thick (five eighths or more of the\r\nvolume, as in Fig. 20, _b_), the fibre sinks whether empty or filled.\r\nThis applies to most of the fibres of the dark summer-wood bands in\r\npines, and to the compact fibres of oak or hickory, and many,\r\nespecially tropical woods, have such thick-walled cells and so little\r\nempty or air space that they never float.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 20. Isolated Fibres of Wood.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, are the two main factors of weight in wood; the amount of\r\ncell wall or wood substance constant for any given piece, and the\r\namount of water contained in the wood, variable even in the standing\r\ntree, and only in part eliminated in drying.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the green wood of any species varies chiefly as a second\r\nfactor, and is entirely misleading, if the relative weight of\r\ndifferent kinds is sought. Thus some green sticks of the otherwise\r\nlighter cypress and gum sink more readily than fresh oak.\r\n\r\nThe weight of sapwood or the sappy, peripheral part of our common\r\nlumber woods is always great, whether cut in winter or summer. It\r\nrarely falls much below forty-five pounds, and commonly exceeds\r\nfifty-five pounds to the cubic foot, even in our lighter wooded\r\nspecies. It follows that the green wood of a sapling is heavier than\r\nthat of an old tree, the fresh wood from a disk of the upper part of a\r\ntree is often heavier than that of the lower part, and the wood near\r\nthe bark heavier than that nearer the pith; and also that the\r\nadvantage of drying the wood before shipping is most important in\r\nsappy and light kinds.\r\n\r\nWhen kiln-dried, the misleading moisture factor of weight is uniformly\r\nreduced, and a fair comparison possible. For the sake of convenience\r\nin comparison, the weight of wood is expressed either as the weight\r\nper cubic foot, or, what is still more convenient, as specific weight\r\nor density. If an old long-leaf pine is cut up (as shown in Fig. 21)\r\nthe wood of disk No. 1 is heavier than that of disk No. 2, the latter\r\nheavier than that of disk No. 3, and the wood of the top disk is found\r\nto be only about three fourths as heavy as that of disk No. 1.\r\nSimiliarly, if disk No. 2 is cut up, as in the figure, the specific\r\nweight of the different parts is:\r\n\r\n              _a_, about 0.52\r\n              _b_, about 0.64\r\n              _c_, about 0.67\r\n    _d_, _e_, _f_, about 0.65\r\n\r\nshowing that in this disk at least the wood formed during the many\r\nyears' growth, represented in piece _a_, is much lighter than that of\r\nformer years. It also shows that the best wood is the middle part,\r\nwith its large proportion of dark summer bands.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 21. Orientation of Wood Samples.]\r\n\r\nCutting up all disks in the same way, it will be found that the piece\r\n_a_ of the first disk is heavier than the piece _a_ of the fifth, and\r\nthat piece _c_ of the first disk excels the piece _c_ of all the other\r\ndisks. This shows that the wood grown during the same number of years\r\nis lighter in the upper parts of the stem; and if the disks are\r\nsmoothed on the radial surfaces and set up one on top of the other in\r\ntheir regular order, for the sake of comparison, this decrease in\r\nweight will be seen to be accompanied by a decrease in the amount of\r\nsummer-wood. The color effect of the upper disks is conspicuously\r\nlighter. If our old pine had been cut one hundred and fifty years ago,\r\nbefore the outer, lighter wood was laid on, it is evident that the\r\nweight of the wood of any one disk would have been found to increase\r\nfrom the center outward, and no subsequent decrease could have been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn a thrifty young pine, then, the wood is heavier from the center\r\noutward, and lighter from below upward; only the wood laid on in old\r\nage falls in weight below the average. The number of brownish bands of\r\nsummer-wood are a direct indication of these differences. If an old\r\noak is cut up in the same manner, the butt cut is also found heaviest\r\nand the top lightest, but, unlike the disk of pine, the disk of oak\r\nhas its firmest wood at the center, and each successive piece from the\r\ncenter outward is lighter than its neighbor.\r\n\r\nExamining the pieces, this difference is not as readily explained by\r\nthe appearance of each piece as in the case of pine wood.\r\nNevertheless, one conspicuous point appears at once. The pores, so\r\nvery distinct in oak, are very minute in the wood near the center, and\r\nthus the wood is far less porous.\r\n\r\nStudying different trees, it is found that in the pines, wood with\r\nnarrow rings is just as heavy as and often heavier than the wood with\r\nwider rings; but if the rings are unusually narrow in any part of the\r\ndisk, the wood has a lighter color; that is, there is less summer-wood\r\nand therefore less weight.\r\n\r\nIn oak, ash, or elm trees of thrifty growth, the rings, fairly wide\r\n(not less than one-twelfth inch), always form the heaviest wood, while\r\nany piece with very narrow rings is light. On the other hand, the\r\nweight of a piece of hard maple or birch is quite independent of the\r\nwidth of its rings.\r\n\r\nThe bases of limbs (knots) are usually heavy, very heavy in conifers,\r\nand also the wood which surrounds them, but generally the wood of the\r\nlimbs is lighter than that of the stem, and the wood of the roots is\r\nthe lightest.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that none of the native woods in common use\r\nin this country are when dry as heavy as water, _i.e._, sixty-two\r\npounds to the cubic foot. Few exceed fifty pounds, while most of them\r\nfall below forty pounds, and much of the pine and other coniferous\r\nwood weigh less than thirty pounds per cubic foot. The weight of the\r\nwood is in itself an important quality. Weight assists in\r\ndistinguishing maple from poplar. Lightness coupled with great\r\nstrength and stiffness recommends wood for a thousand different uses.\r\nTo a large extent weight predicates the strength of the wood, at least\r\nin the same species, so that a heavy piece of oak will exceed in\r\nstrength a light piece of the same species, and in pine it appears\r\nprobable that, weight for weight, the strength of the wood of various\r\npines is nearly equal.\r\n\r\nWEIGHT OF KILN-DRIED WOOD OF DIFFERENT SPECIES\r\n-----------------------------------------+----------------------------\r\n                                         |        Approximate\r\n                                         |----------+-----------------\r\n                                         |          |    Weight of\r\n                                         |          |---------+-------\r\n           Species                       | Specific |    1    | 1,000\r\n                                         |  Weight  |  Cubic  |  Feet\r\n                                         |          |  Foot   | Lumber\r\n-----------------------------------------+----------+---------+-------\r\n(_a_) Very Heavy Woods:                  |          |         |\r\n  Hickory, Oak, Persimmon, Osage Orange, |          |         |\r\n  Black Locust, Hackberry, Blue Beech,   |          |         |\r\n  best of Elm and Ash                    |0.70-0.80 |  42-48  | 3,700\r\n(_b_) Heavy Woods                        |          |         |\r\n  Ash, Elm, Cherry, Birch, Maple, Beech, |          |         |\r\n  Walnut, Sour Gum, Coffee Tree, Honey   |          |         |\r\n  Locust, best of Southern Pine and      |          |         |\r\n  Tamarack                               |0.60-0.70 |  36-42  | 3,200\r\n(_c_) Woods of Medium Weight:            |          |         |\r\n  Southern Pine, Pitch Pine, Tamarack,   |          |         |\r\n  Douglas Spruce, Western Hemlock,       |          |         |\r\n  Sweet Gum, Soft Maple, Sycamore,       |          |         |\r\n  Sassafras, Mulberry, light grades of   |          |         |\r\n  Birch and Cherry                       |0.50-0.60 |  30-36  | 2,700\r\n(_d_) Light Woods:                       |          |         |\r\n  Norway and Bull Pine, Red Cedar,       |          |         |\r\n  Cypress, Hemlock, the Heavier Spruces  |          |         |\r\n  and Firs, Redwood, Basswood, Chestnut, |          |         |\r\n  Butternut, Tulip, Catalpa, Buckeye,    |          |         |\r\n  heavier grades of Poplar               |0.40-0.50 |  24-30  | 2,200\r\n(_e_) Very Light Woods:                   |          |         |\r\n  White Pine, Spruce, Fir, White Cedar,  |          |         |\r\n  Poplar                                 |0.30-0.40 |  18-24  | 1,800\r\n-----------------------------------------+----------+---------+-------\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \"FIGURE\" IN WOOD\r\n\r\nMany theories have been propounded as to the cause of \"figure\" in\r\ntimber; while it is true that all timber possesses \"figure\" in some\r\ndegree, which is more noticeable if it be cut in certain ways, yet\r\nthere are some woods in which it is more conspicuous than in others,\r\nand which for cabinet or furniture work are much appreciated, as it\r\nadds to the value of the work produced.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic \"figure\" of oak is due to the broad and deep\r\nmedullary rays so conspicuous in this timber, and the same applies to\r\nhoneysuckle. Figure due to the same cause is found in sycamore and\r\nbeech, but is not so pronounced. The beautiful figure in \"bird's eye\r\nmaple\" is supposed to be due to the boring action of insects in the\r\nearly growth of the tree, causing pits or grooves, which in time\r\nbecome filled up by being overlain by fresh layers of wood growth;\r\nthese peculiar and unique markings are found only in the older and\r\ninner portion of the tree.\r\n\r\nPitch pine has sometimes a very beautiful \"figure,\" but it generally\r\ndoes not go deep into the timber; walnut has quite a variety of\r\n\"figures,\" and so has the elm. It is in mahogany, however, that we\r\nfind the greatest variety of \"figure,\" and as this timber is only used\r\nfor furniture and fancy work, a good \"figure\" greatly enhances its\r\nvalue, as firmly figured logs bring fancy prices.\r\n\r\nMahogany, unlike the oak, never draws its \"figure\" from its small and\r\nalmost unnoticeable medullary rays, but from the twisted condition of\r\nits fibres; the natural growth of mahogany produces a straight wood;\r\nwhat is called \"figured\" is unnatural and exceptional, and thus adds\r\nto its value as an ornamental wood. These peculiarities are rarely\r\nfound in the earlier portion of the tree that is near the center,\r\nbeing in this respect quite different from maple; they appear when the\r\ntree is more fully developed, and consist of bundles of woody fibres\r\nwhich, instead of being laid in straight lines, behave in an erratic\r\nmanner and are deposited in a twisted form; sometimes it may be caused\r\nby the intersection of branches, or possibly by the crackling of the\r\nbark pressing on the wood, and thus moving it out of its natural\r\nstraight course, causing a wavy line which in time becomes\r\naccentuated.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed by most people that the outer portion of a\r\ntree is often indented by the bark, and the outer rings often follow a\r\nsinuous course which corresponds to this indention, but in most trees,\r\nafter a few years, this is evened up and the annual rings assume their\r\nnearly circular form; it is supposed by some that in the case of\r\nmahogany this is not the case, and that the indentations are even\r\naccentuated.\r\n\r\nThe best figured logs of timber are secured from trees which grow in\r\nfirm rocky soil; those growing on low-lying or swampy ground are\r\nseldom figured. To the practical woodworker the figure in mahogany\r\ncauses some difficulty in planing the wood to a smooth surface; some\r\nportions plane smooth, others are the \"wrong way of the grain.\"\r\n\r\nFigure in wood is effected by the way light is thrown upon it, showing\r\nlight if seen from one direction, and dark if viewed from another, as\r\nmay easily be observed by holding a piece of figured mahogany under\r\nartificial light and looking at it from opposite directions. The\r\ncharacteristic markings on mahogany are \"mottle,\" which is also found\r\nin sycamore, and is conspicuous on the backs of fiddles and violins,\r\nand is not in itself valuable; it runs the transverse way of the\r\nfibres and is probably the effect of the wind upon the tree in its\r\nearly stages of growth. \"Roe,\" which is said to be caused by the\r\ncontortion of the woody fibres, and takes a wavy line parallel to\r\nthem, is also found in the hollow of bent stems and in the root\r\nstructure, and when combined with \"mottle\" is very valuable. \"Dapple\"\r\nis an exaggerated form of mottle. \"Thunder shake,\" \"wind shake,\" or\r\n\"tornado shake\" is a rupture of the fibres across the grain, which in\r\nmahogany does not always break them; the tree swaying in the wind only\r\nstrains its fibres, and thus produces mottle in the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION V\r\n\r\n                            ENEMIES OF WOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the writer's personal investigations of this subject in different\r\nsections of the country, the damage to forest products of various\r\nkinds from this cause seems to be far more extensive than is generally\r\nrecognized. Allowing a loss of five per cent on the total value of the\r\nforest products of the country, which the writer believes to be a\r\nconservative estimate, it would amount to something over $30,000,000\r\nannually. This loss differs from that resulting from insect damage to\r\nnatural forest resources, in that it represents more directly a loss\r\nof money invested in material and labor. In dealing with the insects\r\nmentioned, as with forest insects in general, the methods which yield\r\nthe best results are those which relate directly to preventing attack,\r\nas well as those which are unattractive or unfavorable. The insects\r\nhave two objects in their attack: one is to obtain food, the other is\r\nto prepare for the development of their broods. Different species of\r\ninsects have special periods during the season of activity (March to\r\nNovember), when the adults are on the wing in search of suitable\r\nmaterial in which to deposit their eggs. Some species, which fly in\r\nApril, will be attracted to the trunks of recently felled pine trees\r\nor to piles of pine sawlogs from trees felled the previous winter.\r\nThey are not attracted to any other kind of timber, because they can\r\nlive only in the bark or wood of pine, and only in that which is in\r\nthe proper condition to favor the hatching of their eggs and the\r\nnormal development of their young. As they fly only in April, they\r\ncannot injure the logs of trees felled during the remainder of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThere are also oak insects, which attack nothing but oak; hickory,\r\ncypress, and spruce insects, etc., which have different habits and\r\ndifferent periods of flight, and require special conditions of the\r\nbark and wood for depositing their eggs or for subsequent development\r\nof their broods. Some of these insects have but one generation in a\r\nyear, others have two or more, while some require more than one year\r\nfor the complete development and transformation. Some species deposit\r\ntheir eggs in the bark or wood of trees soon after they are felled or\r\nbefore any perceptible change from the normal living tissue has taken\r\nplace; other species are attracted only to dead bark and dead wood of\r\ntrees which have been felled or girdled for several months; others are\r\nattracted to dry and seasoned wood; while another class will attack\r\nnothing but very old, dry bark or wood of special kinds and under\r\nspecial conditions. Thus it will be seen how important it is for the\r\npractical man to have knowledge of such of the foregoing facts as\r\napply to his immediate interest in the manufacture or utilization of a\r\ngiven forest product, in order that he may with the least trouble and\r\nexpense adjust his business methods to meet the requirements for\r\npreventing losses.\r\n\r\nThe work of different kinds of insects, as represented by special\r\ninjuries to forest products, is the first thing to attract attention,\r\nand the distinctive character of this work is easily observed, while\r\nthe insect responsible for it is seldom seen, or it is so difficult to\r\ndetermine by the general observer from descriptions or illustrations\r\nthat the species is rarely recognized. Fortunately, the character of\r\nthe work is often sufficient in itself to identify the cause and\r\nsuggest a remedy, and in this section primary consideration is given\r\nto this phase of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Ambrosia or Timber Beetles\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 22. Work of Ambrosia Beetles in Tulip or\r\n    Yellow Poplar Wood. _a_, work of _Xyleborus affinis_ and\r\n    _Xyleborus inermis_; _b_, _Xyleborus obesus_ and work; _c_,\r\n    bark; _d_, sapwood; _e_, heartwood.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 23.

The injury consists of pinhole and stained-wood\r\ndefects in the sapwood and heartwood of recently felled or girdled\r\ntrees, sawlogs, pulpwood, stave and shingle bolts, green or\r\nunseasoned lumber, and staves and heads of barrels containing\r\nalcoholic liquids. The holes and galleries are made by the adult\r\nparent beetles, to serve as entrances and temporary houses or\r\nnurseries for the development of their broods of young, which feed on\r\na fungus growing on the walls of the galleries.\r\n\r\nThe growth of this ambrosia-like fungus is induced and controlled by\r\nthe parent beetles, and the young are dependent upon it for food. The\r\nwood must be in exactly the proper condition for the growth of the\r\nfungus in order to attract the beetles and induce them to excavate\r\ntheir galleries; it must have a certain degree of moisture and other\r\nfavorable qualities, which usually prevail during the period involved\r\nin the change from living, or normal, to dead or dry wood; such a\r\ncondition is found in recently felled trees, sawlogs, or like crude\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThere are two general types or classes of these galleries: one in\r\nwhich the broods develop together in the main burrows (see Fig. 22),\r\nthe other in which the individuals develop in short, separate side\r\nchambers, extending at right angles from the primary galleries (see\r\nFig. 23). The galleries of the latter type are usually accompanied by\r\na distinct staining of the wood, while those of the former are not.\r\n\r\nThe beetles responsible for this work are cylindrical in form,\r\napparently with a head (the prothorax) half as long as the remainder\r\nof the body (see Figs. 22, _a_, and 23, _a_).\r\n\r\nNorth American species vary in size from less than one-tenth to\r\nslightly more than two-tenths of an inch, while some of the\r\nsubtropical and tropical species attain a much larger size. The\r\ndiameter of the holes made by each species corresponds closely to that\r\nof the body, and varies from about one-twentieth to one-sixteenth of\r\nan inch for the tropical species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Round-headed Borers\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 24. Work of Round-headed and Flat-headed\r\n    Borers in Pine. _a_, work of round-headed borer, \"sawyer,\"\r\n    _Monohammus spiculatus_, natural size _b_, _Ergates\r\n    spiculatus_; _c_, work of flat-headed borer, _Buprestis_,\r\n    larva and adult; _d_, bark; _e_, sapwood; _f_, heartwood.]\r\n\r\nThe character of the work of this class of wood- and bark-boring grubs\r\nis shown in Fig. 24. The injuries consist of irregular flattened or\r\nnearly round wormhole defects in the wood, which sometimes result in\r\nthe destruction of valuable parts of the wood or bark material. The\r\nsapwood and heartwood of recently felled trees, sawlogs, poles posts,\r\nmine props, pulpwood and cordwood, also lumber or square timber, with\r\nbark on the edges, and construction timber in new and old buildings,\r\nare injured by wormhole defects, while the valuable parts of stored\r\noak and hemlock tanbark and certain kinds of wood are converted into\r\nworm-dust. These injuries are caused by the young or larvae of\r\nlong-horned beetles. Those which infest the wood hatch from eggs\r\ndeposited in the outer bark of logs and like material, and the minute\r\ngrubs hatching therefrom bore into the inner bark, through which they\r\nextend their irregular burrows, for the purpose of obtaining food from\r\nthe sap and other nutritive material found in the plant tissue. They\r\ncontinue to extend and enlarge their burrows as they increase in size,\r\nuntil they are nearly or quite full grown. They then enter the wood\r\nand continue their excavations deep into the sapwood or heartwood\r\nuntil they attain their normal size. They then excavate pupa cells in\r\nwhich to transform into adults, which emerge from the wood through\r\nexit holes in the surface. This class of borers is represented by a\r\nlarge number of species. The adults, however, are seldom seen by the\r\ngeneral observer unless cut out of the wood before they have emerged.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Flat-headed Borers\r\n\r\nThe work of the flat-headed borers (Fig. 24) is only distinguished\r\nfrom that of the preceding by the broad, shallow burrows, and the much\r\nmore oblong form of the exit holes. In general, the injuries are\r\nsimiliar, and effect the same class of products, but they are of much\r\nless importance. The adult forms are flattened, metallic-colored\r\nbeetles, and represent many species, of various sizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Timber Worms\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 25. Work of Timber Worms in Oak. _a_,\r\n    work of oak timber worm, _Eupsalis minuta_; _b_, barked\r\n    surface; _c_, bark; _d_, sapwood timber worm, _Hylocoetus\r\n    lugubris_, and work; _e_, sapwood.]\r\n\r\nThe character of the work done by this class is shown in Fig. 25. The\r\ninjury consists of pinhole defects in the sapwood and heartwood of\r\nfelled trees, sawlogs and like material which have been left in the\r\nwoods or in piles in the open for several months during the warmer\r\nseasons. Stave and shingle bolts and closely piled oak lumber and\r\nsquare timbers also suffer from injury of this kind. These injuries\r\nare made by elongate, slender worms or larvae, which hatch from eggs\r\ndeposited by the adult beetles in the outer bark, or, where there is\r\nno bark, just beneath the surface of the wood. At first the young\r\nlarvae bore almost invisible holes for a long distance through the\r\nsapwood and heartwood, but as they increase in size the same holes are\r\nenlarged and extended until the larvae have attained their full\r\ngrowth. They then transform to adults, and emerge through the enlarged\r\nentrance burrows. The work of these timber worms is distinguished from\r\nthat of the timber beetles by the greater variation in the size of\r\nholes in the same piece of wood, also by the fact that they are not\r\nbranched from a single entrance or gallery, as are those made by the\r\nbeetles.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 26. Work of Powder Post Beetle,\r\n    _Sinoxylon basilare_, in Hickory Poles, showing Transverse\r\n    Egg Galleries excavated by the Adult, _a_, entrance; _b_,\r\n    gallery; _c_, adult.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 27. Work of Powder\r\n    Post Beetle, _Sinoxylon basilare_, in Hickory Pole. _a_,\r\n    character of work by larvae; _b_, exit holes made by\r\n    emerging broods.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Powder Post Borers\r\n\r\nThe character of the work of this class of insects is shown in Figs.\r\n26, 27, and 28. The injury consists of closely placed burrows, packed\r\nwith borings, or a completely destroyed or powdered condition of the\r\nwood of seasoned products, such as lumber, crude and finished handle\r\nand wagon stock, cooperage and wooden truss hoops, furniture, and\r\ninside finish woodwork, in old buildings, as well as in many other\r\ncrude or finished and utilized woods. This is the work of both the\r\nadults and young stages of some species, or of the larval stage alone\r\nof others. In the former, the adult beetles deposit their eggs in\r\nburrows or galleries excavated for the purpose, as in Figs. 26 and 27,\r\nwhile in the latter (Fig. 28) the eggs are on or beneath the surface\r\nof the wood. The grubs complete the destruction by boring through the\r\nsolid wood in all directions and packing their burrows with the\r\npowdered wood. When they are full grown they transform to the adult,\r\nand emerge from the injured material through holes in the surface.\r\nSome of the species continue to work in the same wood until many\r\ngenerations have developed and emerged or until every particle of wood\r\ntissue has been destroyed and the available nutritive substance\r\nextracted.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 28.

This period of danger varies with the time\r\nof the year the timber is felled and with the different kinds of\r\ntrees. Those felled in late fall and winter will generally remain\r\nattractive to ambrosia beetles, and to the adults of round- and\r\nflat-headed borers during March, April, and May. Those felled in April\r\nto September may be attacked in a few days after they are felled, and\r\nthe period of danger may not extend over more than a few weeks.\r\nCertain kinds of trees felled during certain months and seasons are\r\nnever attacked, because the danger period prevails only when the\r\ninsects are flying; on the other hand, if the same kinds of trees are\r\nfelled at a different time, the conditions may be most attractive when\r\nthe insects are active, and they will be thickly infested and ruined.\r\n\r\nThe presence of bark is absolutely necessary for infestation by most\r\nof the wood-boring grubs, since the eggs and young stages must occupy\r\nthe outer and inner portions before they can enter the wood. Some\r\nambrosia and timber worms will, however, attack barked logs,\r\nespecially those in close piles, and others shaded and protected from\r\nrapid drying.\r\n\r\nThe sapwood of pine, spruce, fir, cedar, cypress, and the like\r\nsoftwoods is especially liable to injury by ambrosia beetles, while\r\nthe heartwood is sometimes ruined by a class of round-headed borers,\r\nknown as \"sawyers.\" Yellow poplar, oak, chestnut, gum, hickory, and\r\nmost other hardwoods are as a rule attacked by species of ambrosia\r\nbeetles, sawyers, and timber worms, different from those infesting the\r\npines, there being but very few species which attack both.\r\n\r\nMahogany and other rare and valuable woods imported from the tropics\r\nto this country in the form of round logs, with or without bark on,\r\nare commonly damaged more or less seriously by ambrosia beetles and\r\ntimber worms.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the writer's investigations of logs received at\r\nthe mills in this country, that the principal damage is done during a\r\nlimited period--from the time the trees are felled until they are\r\nplaced in fresh or salt water for transportation to the shipping\r\npoints. If, however, the logs are loaded on a vessel direct from the\r\nshore, or if not left in the water long enough to kill the insects,\r\nthe latter will continue their destructive work during transportation\r\nto other countries and after they arrive, and until cold weather\r\nensues or the logs are converted into lumber.\r\n\r\nIt was also found that a thorough soaking in sea-water, while it\r\nusually killed the insects at the time, did not prevent subsequent\r\nattacks by both foreign and native ambrosia beetles; also, that the\r\nremoval of the bark from such logs previous to immersion did not\r\nrender them entirely immune. Those with the bark off were attacked\r\nmore than those with it on, owing to a greater amount of saline\r\nmoisture retained by the bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         How to Prevent Injury\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that some requisites for preventing\r\nthese insect injuries to round timber are:\r\n\r\n     1. To provide for as little delay as possible between the\r\n     felling of the tree and its manufacture into rough products.\r\n     This is especially necessary with trees felled from April to\r\n     September, in the region north of the Gulf States, and from\r\n     March to November in the latter, while the late fall and\r\n     winter cutting should all be worked up by March or April.\r\n\r\n     2. If the round timber must be left in the woods or on the\r\n     skidways during the danger period, every precaution should\r\n     be taken to facilitate rapid drying of the inner bark, by\r\n     keeping the logs off the ground in the sun, or in loose\r\n     piles; or else the opposite extreme should be adopted and\r\n     the logs kept in water.\r\n\r\n     3. The immediate removal of all the bark from poles, posts,\r\n     and other material which will not be seriously damaged by\r\n     checking or season checks.\r\n\r\n     4. To determine and utilize the proper months or seasons to\r\n     girdle or fell different kinds of trees: Bald cypress in the\r\n     swamps of the South are \"girdled\" in order that they may\r\n     die, and in a few weeks or months dry out and become light\r\n     enough to float. This method has been extensively adopted in\r\n     sections where it is the only practicable one by which the\r\n     timber can be transported to the sawmills. It is found,\r\n     however, that some of these \"girdled\" trees are especially\r\n     attractive to several species of ambrosia beetles (Figs. 22\r\n     and 23), round-headed borers (Fig. 24) and timber worms\r\n     (Fig. 25), which cause serious injury to the sapwood or\r\n     heartwood, while other trees \"girdled\" at a different time\r\n     or season are not injured. This suggested to the writer the\r\n     importance of experiments to determine the proper time to\r\n     \"girdle\" trees to avoid losses, and they are now being\r\n     conducted on an extensive scale by the United States Forest\r\n     Service, in co-operation with prominent cypress operators in\r\n     different sections of the cypress-growing region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Saplings\r\n\r\nSaplings, including hickory and other round hoop-poles and similiar\r\nproducts, are subject to serious injuries and destruction by round-\r\nand flat-headed borers (Fig. 24), and certain species of powder post\r\nborers (Figs. 26 and 27) before the bark and wood are dead or dry, and\r\nalso by other powder post borers (Fig. 28) after they are dried and\r\nseasoned. The conditions favoring attack by the former class are those\r\nresulting from leaving the poles in piles or bundles in or near the\r\nforest for a few weeks during the season of insect activity, and by\r\nthe latter from leaving them stored in one place for several months.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Stave, Heading and Shingle Bolts\r\n\r\nThese are attacked by ambrosia beetles (Figs. 22 and 23), and the oak\r\ntimber worm (Fig. 25, _a_), which, as has been frequently reported,\r\ncause serious losses. The conditions favoring attack by these insects\r\nare similiar to those mentioned under \"Round Timber.\" The insects may\r\nenter the wood before the bolts are cut from the log or afterward,\r\nespecially if the bolts are left in moist, shady places in the woods,\r\nin close piles during the danger period. If cut during the warm\r\nseason, the bark should be removed and the bolts converted into the\r\nsmallest practicable size and piled in such manner as to facilitate\r\nrapid drying.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Unseasoned Products in the Rough\r\n\r\nFreshly sawn hardwood, placed in close piles during warm, damp weather\r\nin July and September, presents especially favorable conditions for\r\ninjury by ambrosia beetles (Figs. 22, _a_, and 23, _a_). This is due\r\nto the continued moist condition of such material.\r\n\r\nHeavy two-inch or three-inch stuff is also liable to attack even in\r\nloose piles with lumber or cross sticks. An example of the latter was\r\nfound in a valuable lot of mahogany lumber of first grade, the value\r\nof which was reduced two thirds by injury from a native ambrosia\r\nbeetle. Numerous complaints have been received from different sections\r\nof the country of this class of injury to oak, poplar, gum, and other\r\nhardwoods. In all cases it is the moist condition and retarded drying\r\nof the lumber which induces attack; therefore, any method which will\r\nprovide for the rapid drying of the wood before or after piling will\r\ntend to prevent losses.\r\n\r\nIt is important that heavy lumber should, as far as possible, be cut\r\nin the winter months and piled so that it will be well dried out\r\nbefore the middle of March. Square timber, stave and heading bolts,\r\nwith the bark on, often suffer from injuries by flat- or round-headed\r\nborers, hatching from eggs deposited in the bark of the logs before\r\nthey are sawed and piled. One example of serious damage and loss was\r\nreported in which white pine staves for paint buckets and other small\r\nwooden vessels, which had been sawed from small logs, and the bark\r\nleft on the edges, were attacked by a round-headed borer, the adults\r\nhaving deposited their eggs in the bark after the stock was sawn and\r\npiled. The character of the injury is shown in Fig. 29. Another\r\nexample was reported from a manufacturer in the South, where the\r\npieces of lumber which had strips of bark on one side were seriously\r\ndamaged by the same kind of borer, the eggs having been deposited in\r\nthe logs before sawing or in the bark after the lumber was piled. If\r\nthe eggs are deposited in the logs, and the borers have entered the\r\ninner bark or the wood before sawing, they may continue their work\r\nregardless of methods of piling, but if such lumber is cut from new\r\nlogs and placed in the pile while green, with the bark surface up, it\r\nwill be much less liable to attack than if piled with the bark edges\r\ndown. This liability of lumber with bark edges or sides to be attacked\r\nby insects suggests the importance of the removal of the bark, to\r\nprevent damage, or, if this is not practicable, the lumber with the\r\nbark on the sides should be piled in open, loose piles with the bark\r\nup, while that with the bark on the edges should be placed on the\r\nouter edges of the piles, exposed to the light and air.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 29. Work of Round-headed Borers,\r\n    _Callidium antennatum_, in White Pine Bucket Staves from New\r\n    Hampshire. _a_, where egg was deposited in bark; _b_, larval\r\n    mine; _c_, pupal cell; _d_, exit in bark; _e_, adult.]\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States it is difficult to keep green timber in the\r\nwoods or in piles for any length of time, because of the rapidity\r\nwhich wood-destroying fungi attack it. This is particularly true\r\nduring the summer season, when the humidity is greatest. There is\r\nreally no easily-applied, general specific for these summer troubles\r\nin the handling of wood, but there are some suggestions that are worth\r\nwhile that it may be well to mention. One of these, and the most\r\nimportant, is to remove all the bark from the timber that has been\r\ncut, just as soon as possible after felling. And, in this, emphasis\r\nshould be laid on the ALL, as a piece of bark no larger than a man's\r\nlittle finger will furnish an entering place for insects, and once\r\nthey get in, it is a difficult matter to get rid of them, for they\r\nseldom stop boring until they ruin the stick. And again, after the\r\ntimber has been felled and the bark removed, it is well to get it to\r\nthe mill pond or cut up into merchantable sizes and on to the pile as\r\nsoon as possible. What is wanted is to get the timber up off the\r\nground, to a place where it can get plenty of air, to enable the sap\r\nto dry up before it sours; and, besides, large units of wood are more\r\nlikely to crack open on the ends from the heat than they would if cut\r\nup into the smaller units for merchandizing.\r\n\r\nA moist condition of lumber and square timber, such as results from\r\nclose or solid piles, with the bottom layers on the ground or on\r\nfoundations of old decaying logs or near decaying stumps and logs,\r\noffers especially favorable conditions for the attack of white ants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Seasoned Products in the Rough\r\n\r\nSeasoned or dry timber in stacks or storage is liable to injury by\r\npowder post borers (Fig. 28). The conditions favoring attack are: (1)\r\nThe presence of a large proportion of sapwood, as in hickory, ash, and\r\nsimiliar woods; (2) material which is two or more years old, or that\r\nwhich has been kept in one place for a long time; (3) access to old\r\ninfested material. Therefore, such stock should be frequently examined\r\nfor evidence of the presence of these insects. This is always\r\nindicated by fine, flour-like powder on or beneath the piles, or\r\notherwise associated with such material. All infested material should\r\nbe at once removed and the infested parts destroyed by burning.\r\n\r\n\r\n              Dry Cooperage Stock and Wooden Truss Hoops\r\n\r\nThese are especially liable to attack and serious injury by powder\r\npost borers (Fig. 28), under the same or similiar conditions as the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Staves and Heads of Barrels containing Alcoholic Liquids\r\n\r\nThese are liable to attack by ambrosia beetles (Figs. 22, _a_, and 23,\r\n_a_), which are attracted by the moist condition and possibly by the\r\npeculiar odor of the wood, resembling that of dying sapwood of trees\r\nand logs, which is their normal breeding place.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples on record of serious losses of liquors from\r\nleakage caused by the beetles boring through the staves and heads of\r\nthe barrels and casks in cellars and storerooms.\r\n\r\nThe condition, in addition to the moisture of the wood, which is\r\nfavorable for the presence of the beetles, is proximity to their\r\nbreeding places, such as the trunks and stumps of recently felled or\r\ndying oak, maple, and other hardwood or deciduous trees; lumber yards,\r\nsawmills, freshly-cut cordwood, from living or dead trees, and forests\r\nof hardwood timber. Under such conditions the beetles occur in great\r\nnumbers, and if the storerooms and cellars in which the barrels are\r\nkept stored are damp, poorly ventilated, and readily accessible to\r\nthem, serious injury is almost certain to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION VI\r\n\r\n                             WATER IN WOOD\r\n\r\n                     DISTRIBUTION OF WATER IN WOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Local Distribution of Water in Wood\r\n\r\nAs seasoning means essentially the more or less rapid evaporation of\r\nwater from wood, it will be necessary to discuss at the very outset\r\nwhere water is found in wood, and its local seasonal distribution in a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nWater may occur in wood in three conditions: (1) It forms the greater\r\npart (over 90 per cent) of the protoplasmic contents of the living\r\ncells; (2) it saturates the walls of all cells; and (3) it entirely or\r\nat least partly fills the cavities of the lifeless cells, fibres, and\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nIn the sapwood of pine it occurs in all three forms; in the heartwood\r\nonly in the second form, it merely saturates the walls.\r\n\r\nOf 100 pounds of water associated with 100 pounds of dry wood\r\nsubstance taken from 200 pounds of fresh sapwood of white pine, about\r\n35 pounds are needed to saturate the cell walls, less than 5 pounds\r\nare contained in the living cells, and the remaining 60 pounds partly\r\nfill the cavities of the wood fibres. This latter forms the sap as\r\nordinarily understood.\r\n\r\nThe wood next to the bark contains the most water. In the species\r\nwhich do not form heartwood, the decrease toward the pith is gradual,\r\nbut where heartwood is formed the change from a more moist to a drier\r\ncondition is usually quite abrupt at the sapwood limit.\r\n\r\nIn long-leaf pine, the wood of the outer one inch of a disk may\r\ncontain 50 per cent of water, that of the next, or the second inch,\r\nonly 35 per cent, and that of the heartwood, only 20 per cent. In\r\nsuch a tree the amount of water in any one section varies with the\r\namount of sapwood, and is greater for the upper than the lower cuts,\r\ngreater for the limbs than the stems, and greatest of all in the\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nDifferent trees, even of the same kind and from the same place, differ\r\nas to the amount of water they contain. A thrifty tree contains more\r\nwater than a stunted one, and a young tree more than on old one, while\r\nthe wood of all trees varies in its moisture relations with the season\r\nof the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Seasonal Distribution of Water in Wood\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that trees contain less water in winter than\r\nin summer. This is evidenced by the popular saying that \"the sap is\r\ndown in the winter.\" This is probably not always the case; some trees\r\ncontain as much water in winter as in summer, if not more. Trees\r\nnormally contain the greatest amount of water during that period when\r\nthe roots are active and the leaves are not yet out. This activity\r\ncommonly begins in January, February, and March, the exact time\r\nvarying with the kind of timber and the local atmospheric conditions.\r\nAnd it has been found that green wood becomes lighter or contains less\r\nwater in late spring or early summer, when transpiration through the\r\nfoliage is most rapid. The amount of water at any one season, however,\r\nis doubtless much influenced by the amount of moisture in the soil.\r\nThe fact that the bark peels easily in the spring depends on the\r\npresence of incomplete, soft tissue found between wood and bark during\r\nthis season, and has little to do with the total amount of water\r\ncontained in the wood of the stem.\r\n\r\nEven in the living tree a flow of sap from a cut occurs only in\r\ncertain kinds of trees and under special circumstances. From boards,\r\nfelled timber, etc., the water does not flow out, as is sometimes\r\nbelieved, but must be evaporated. The seeming exceptions to this rule\r\nare mostly referable to two causes; clefts or \"shakes\" will allow\r\nwater contained in them to flow out, and water is forced out of sound\r\nwood, if very sappy, whenever the wood is warmed, just as water flows\r\nfrom green wood when put in a stove.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Composition of Sap\r\n\r\nThe term \"sap\" is an ambiguous expression. The sap in the tree\r\ndescends through the bark, and except in early spring is not present\r\nin the wood of the tree except in the medullary rays and living\r\ntissues in the \"sapwood.\"\r\n\r\nWhat flows through the \"sapwood\" is chiefly water brought from the\r\nsoil. It is not pure water, but contains many substances in solution,\r\nsuch as mineral salts, and in certain species--maple, birch, etc., it\r\nalso contains at certain times a small percentage of sugar and other\r\norganic matter.\r\n\r\nThe water rises from the roots through the sapwood to the leaves,\r\nwhere it is converted into true \"sap\" which descends through the bark\r\nand feeds the living tissues between the bark and the wood, which\r\ntissues make the annual growth of the trunk. The wood itself contains\r\nvery little true sap and the heartwood none.\r\n\r\nThe wood contains, however, mineral substances, organic acids,\r\nvolatile oils and gums, as resin, cedar oil, etc.\r\n\r\nAll the conifers--pines, cedars, junipers, cypresses, sequoias, yews,\r\nand spruces--contain resin. The sap of deciduous trees--those which\r\nshed their leaves at stated seasons--is lacking in this element, and\r\nits constituents vary greatly in the different species. But there is\r\none element common to all trees, and for that matter to almost all\r\nplant growth, and that is albumen.\r\n\r\nBoth resin and albumen, as they exist in the sap of woods, are soluble\r\nin water; and both harden with heat, much the same as the white of an\r\negg, which is almost pure albumen.\r\n\r\nThese organic substances are the dissolved reserve food, stored during\r\nthe winter in the pith rays, etc., of the wood and bark; generally but\r\na mere trace of them is to be found. From this it appears that the\r\nsolids contained in the sap, such as albumen, gum, sugar, etc.,\r\ncannot exercise the influence on the strength of the wood which is so\r\ncommonly claimed for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Effects of Moisture on Wood\r\n\r\nThe question of the effect of moisture upon the strength and stiffness\r\nof wood offers a wide scope for study, and authorities consulted\r\ndiffer in conclusions. Two authorities give the tensile strength in\r\npounds per square inch for white oak as 10,000 and 19,500,\r\nrespectively; for spruce, 8,000 to 19,500, and other species in\r\nsimiliar startling contrasts.\r\n\r\nWood, we are told, is composed of organic products. The chief material\r\nis cellulose, and this in its natural state in the living plant or\r\ngreen wood contains from 25 to 35 per cent of its weight in moisture.\r\nThe moisture renders the cellulose substance pliable. What the\r\nphysical action of the water is upon the molecular structure of\r\norganic material, to render it softer and more pliable, is largely a\r\nmatter of conjecture.\r\n\r\nThe strength of a timber depends not only upon its relative freedom\r\nfrom imperfections, such as knots, crookedness of grain, decay,\r\nwormholes or ring-shakes, but also upon its density; upon the rate at\r\nwhich it grew, and upon the arrangement of the various elements which\r\ncompose it.\r\n\r\nThe factors effecting the strength of wood are therefore of two\r\nclasses: (1) Those inherent in the wood itself and which may cause\r\ndifferences to exist between two pieces from the same species of wood\r\nor even between the two ends of a piece, and (2) those which are\r\nforeign to the wood itself, such as moisture, oils, and heat.\r\n\r\nThough the effect of moisture is generally temporary, it is far more\r\nimportant than is generally realized. So great, indeed, is the effect\r\nof moisture that under some conditions it outweighs all the other\r\ncauses which effect strength, with the exception, perhaps of decided\r\nimperfections in the wood itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The Fibre Saturation Point in Wood\r\n\r\nWater exists in green wood in two forms: (1) As liquid water contained\r\nin the cavities of the cells or pores, and (2) as \"imbibed\" water\r\nintimately absorbed in the substance of which the wood is composed.\r\nThe removal of the free water from the cells or pores will evidently\r\nhave no effect upon the physical properties or shrinkage of the wood,\r\nbut as soon as any of the \"imbibed\" moisture is removed from the cell\r\nwalls, shrinkage begins to take place and other changes occur. The\r\nstrength also begins to increase at this time.\r\n\r\nThe point where the cell walls or wood substance becomes saturated is\r\ncalled the \"fibre saturation point,\" and is a very significant point\r\nin the drying of wood.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to remove the free water from woods which will stand a high\r\ntemperature, as it is only necessary to heat the wood slightly above\r\nthe boiling point in a closed vessel, which will allow the escape of\r\nthe steam as it is formed, but will not allow dry air to come in\r\ncontact with the wood, so that the surface will not become dried below\r\nits saturation point. This can be accomplished with most of the\r\nsoftwoods, but not as a rule with the hardwoods, as they are injured\r\nby the temperature necessary.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulties are encountered in evaporating the \"imbibed\"\r\nmoisture and also where the free water has to be removed through its\r\ngradual transfusion instead of boiling. As soon as the imbibed\r\nmoisture begins to be extracted from any portion, shrinkage takes\r\nplace and stresses are set up in the wood which tend to cause\r\nchecking.\r\n\r\nThe fibre saturation point lies between moisture conditions of 25 and\r\n30 per cent of the dry weight of the wood, depending on the species.\r\nCertain species of eucalyptus, and probably other woods, however,\r\nappear to be exceptional in this respect, in that shrinkage begins to\r\ntake place at a moisture condition of 80 to 90 per cent of the dry\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION VII\r\n\r\n                           WHAT SEASONING IS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeasoning is ordinarily understood to mean drying. When exposed to the\r\nsun and air, the water in green wood rapidly evaporates. The rate of\r\nevaporation will depend on: (1) the kind of wood; (2) the shape and\r\nthickness of the timber; and (3) the conditions under which the wood\r\nis placed or piled.\r\n\r\nPieces of wood completely surrounded by air, exposed to the wind and\r\nthe sun, and protected by a roof from rain and snow, will dry out very\r\nrapidly, while wood piled or packed close together so as to exclude\r\nthe air, or left in the shade and exposed to rain and snow, will dry\r\nout very slowly and will also be subject to mould and decay.\r\n\r\nBut seasoning implies other changes besides the evaporation of water.\r\nAlthough we have as yet only a vague conception as to the exact nature\r\nof the difference between seasoned and unseasoned wood, it is very\r\nprobable that one of these consists in changes in the albuminous\r\nsubstances in the wood fibres, and possibly also in the tannins,\r\nresins, and other incrusting substances. Whether the change in these\r\nsubstances is merely a drying-out, or whether it consists in a partial\r\ndecomposition is at yet undetermined. That the change during the\r\nseasoning process is a profound one there can be no doubt, because\r\nexperience has shown again and again that seasoned wood fibre is very\r\nmuch more permeable, both for liquids and gases than the living,\r\nunseasoned fibre.\r\n\r\nOne can picture the albuminous substances as forming a coating which\r\ndries out and possibly disintegrates when the wood dries. The\r\ndrying-out may result in considerable shrinkage, which may make the\r\nwood fibre more porous. It is also possible that there are oxidizing\r\ninfluences at work within these substances which result in their\r\ndisintegration. Whatever the exact nature of the change may be, one\r\ncan say without hesitation that exposure to the wind and air brings\r\nabout changes in the wood, which are of such a nature that the wood\r\nbecomes drier and more permeable.\r\n\r\nWhen seasoned by exposure to live steam, similiar changes may take\r\nplace; the water leaves the wood in the form of steam, while the\r\norganic compounds in the walls probably coagulate or disintegrate\r\nunder the high temperature.\r\n\r\nThe most effective seasoning is without doubt that obtained by the\r\nuniform, slow drying which takes place in properly constructed piles\r\noutdoors, under exposure to the winds and the sun and under cover from\r\nthe rain and snow, and is what has been termed \"air-seasoning.\" By\r\nair-seasoning oak and similiar hardwoods, nature performs certain\r\nfunctions that cannot be duplicated by any artificial means. Because\r\nof this, woods of this class cannot be successfully kiln-dried green\r\nfrom the saw.\r\n\r\nIn drying wood, the free water within the cells passes through the\r\ncell walls until the cells are empty, while the cell walls remain\r\nsaturated. When all the free water has been removed, the cell walls\r\nbegin to yield up their moisture. Heat raises the absorptive power of\r\nthe fibres and so aids the passage of water from the interior of the\r\ncells. A confusion in the word \"sap\" is to be found in many\r\ndiscussions of kiln-drying; in some instances it means water, in other\r\ncases it is applied to the organic substances held in a water solution\r\nin the cell cavities. The term is best confined to the organic\r\nsubstances from the living cell. These substances, for the most part\r\nof the nature of sugar, have a strong attraction for water and water\r\nvapor, and so retard drying and absorb moisture into dried wood. High\r\ntemperatures, especially those produced by live steam, appear to\r\ndestroy these organic compounds and therefore both to retard and to\r\nlimit the reabsorption of moisture when the wood is subsequently\r\nexposed to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAir-dried wood, under ordinary atmospheric temperatures, retains from\r\n10 to 20 per cent of moisture, whereas kiln-dried wood may have no\r\nmore than 5 per cent as it comes from the kiln. The exact figures for\r\na given species depend in the first case upon the weather conditions,\r\nand in the second case upon the temperature in the kiln and the time\r\nduring which the wood is exposed to it. When wood that has been\r\nkiln-dried is allowed to stand in the open, it apparently ceases to\r\nreabsorb moisture from the air before its moisture content equals that\r\nof wood which has merely been air-dried in the same place, and under\r\nthe same conditions, in other words kiln-dried wood will not absorb as\r\nmuch moisture as air-dried wood under the same conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n            Difference between Seasoned and Unseasoned Wood\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been known for a long time that there is a marked\r\ndifference in the length of life of seasoned and of unseasoned wood,\r\nthe consumers of wood have shown very little interest in its\r\nseasoning, except for the purpose of doing away with the evils which\r\nresult from checking, warping, and shrinking. For this purpose both\r\nkiln-drying and air-seasoning are largely in use.\r\n\r\nThe drying of material is a subject which is extremely important to\r\nmost industries, and in no industry is it of more importance than in\r\nthe lumber trade. Timber drying means not only the extracting of so\r\nmuch water, but goes very deeply into the quality of the wood, its\r\nworkability and its cell strength, etc.\r\n\r\nKiln-drying, which dries the wood at a uniformly rapid rate by\r\nartificially heating it in inclosed rooms, has become a part of almost\r\nevery woodworking industry, as without it the construction of the\r\nfinished product would often be impossible. Nevertheless much\r\nunseasoned or imperfectly seasoned wood is used, as is evidenced by\r\nthe frequent shrinkage and warping of the finished articles. This is\r\nexplained to a certain extent by the fact that the manufacturer is\r\noften so hard pressed for his product that he is forced to send out an\r\ninferior article, which the consumer is willing to accept in that\r\ncondition rather than to wait several weeks or months for an article\r\nmade up of thoroughly seasoned material, and also that dry kilns are\r\nat present constructed and operated largely without thoroughgoing\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nForms of kilns and mode of operation have commonly been copied by one\r\nwoodworking plant after the example of some neighboring establishment.\r\nIn this way it has been brought about that the present practices have\r\nmany shortcomings. The most progressive operators, however, have\r\nexperimented freely in the effort to secure special results desirable\r\nfor their peculiar products. Despite the diversity of practice, it is\r\npossible to find among the larger and more enterprising operators a\r\nmeasure of agreement, as to both methods and results, and from this to\r\noutline the essentials of a correct theory. As a result, properly\r\nseasoned wood commands a high price, and in some cases cannot be\r\nobtained at all.\r\n\r\nWood seasoned out of doors, which by many is supposed to be much\r\nsuperior to kiln-dried material, is becoming very scarce, as the\r\ndemand for any kind of wood is so great that it is thought not to pay\r\nto hold it for the time necessary to season it properly. How long this\r\nstate of affairs is going to last it is difficult to say, but it is\r\nbelieved that a reaction will come when the consumer learns that in\r\nthe long run it does not pay to use poorly seasoned material. Such a\r\ncondition has now arisen in connection with another phase of the\r\nseasoning of wood; it is a commonly accepted fact that dry wood will\r\nnot decay nearly so fast as wet or green wood; nevertheless, the\r\nimmense superiority of seasoned over unseasoned wood for all purposes\r\nwhere resistance to decay is necessary has not been sufficiently\r\nrecognized. In the times when wood of all kinds was both plentiful and\r\ncheap, it mattered little in most cases how long it lasted or resisted\r\ndecay. Wood used for furniture, flooring, car construction, cooperage,\r\netc., usually got some chance to dry out before or after it was placed\r\nin use. The wood which was exposed to decaying influences was\r\ngenerally selected from those woods which, whatever their other\r\nqualities might be, would resist decay longest.\r\n\r\nTo-day conditions have changed, so that wood can no longer be used to\r\nthe same extent as in former years. Inferior woods with less lasting\r\nqualities have been pressed into service. Although haphazard methods\r\nof cutting and subsequent use are still much in vogue, there are many\r\nsigns that both lumbermen and consumers are awakening to the fact that\r\nsuch carelessness and wasteful methods of handling wood will no longer\r\ndo, and must give way to more exact and economical methods. The reason\r\nwhy many manufacturers and consumers of wood are still using the older\r\nmethods is perhaps because of long custom, and because they have not\r\nyet learned that, though the saving to be obtained by the application\r\nof good methods has at all times been appreciable, now, when wood is\r\nmore valuable, a much greater saving is possible. The increased cost\r\nof applying economical methods is really very slight, and is many\r\ntimes exceeded by the value of the increased service which can be\r\nsecured through its use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Manner of Evaporation of Water\r\n\r\nThe evaporation of water from wood takes place largely through the\r\nends, _i.e._, in the direction of the longitudinal axis of the wood\r\nfibres. The evaporation from the other surfaces takes place very\r\nslowly out of doors, and with greater rapidity in a dry kiln. The rate\r\nof evaporation differs both with the kind of timber and its shape;\r\nthat is, thin material will dry more rapidly than heavier stock.\r\nSapwood dries faster than heartwood, and pine more rapidly than oak or\r\nother hardwoods.\r\n\r\nTests made show little difference in the rate of evaporation in sawn\r\nand hewn stock, the results, however, not being conclusive. Air-drying\r\nout of doors takes from two months to a year, the time depending on\r\nthe kind of timber, its thickness, and the climatic conditions. After\r\nwood has reached an air-dry condition it absorbs water in small\r\nquantities after a rain or during damp weather, much of which is\r\nimmediately lost again when a few warm, dry days follow. In this way\r\nwood exposed to the weather will continue to absorb water and lose it\r\nfor indefinite periods.\r\n\r\nWhen soaked in water, seasoned woods absorb water rapidly. This at\r\nfirst enters into the wood through the cell walls; when these are\r\nsoaked, the water will fill the cell lumen, so that if constantly\r\nsubmerged the wood may become completely filled with water.\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the gain in weight by absorption of several\r\nconiferous woods, air-dry at the start, expressed in per cent of the\r\nkiln-dry weight:\r\n\r\n                    ABSORPTION OF WATER BY DRY WOOD\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                  | White Pine | Red Cedar | Hemlock | Tamarack\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\nAir-dried         |    108     |   109     |   111   |   108\r\nKiln-dried        |    100     |   100     |   100   |   100\r\nIn water 1 day    |    135     |   120     |   133   |   129\r\nIn water 2 days   |    147     |   126     |   144   |   136\r\nIn water 3 days   |    154     |   132     |   149   |   142\r\nIn water 4 days   |    162     |   137     |   154   |   147\r\nIn water 5 days   |    165     |   140     |   158   |   150\r\nIn water 7 days   |    176     |   143     |   164   |   156\r\nIn water 9 days   |    179     |   147     |   168   |   157\r\nIn water 11 days  |    184     |   149     |   173   |   159\r\nIn water 14 days  |    187     |   150     |   176   |   159\r\nIn water 17 days  |    192     |   152     |   176   |   161\r\nIn water 25 days  |    198     |   155     |   180   |   161\r\nIn water 30 days  |    207     |   158     |   183   |   166\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Rapidity of Evaporation\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which water is evaporated, that is, the rate of\r\ndrying, depends on the size and shape of the piece and on the\r\nstructure of the wood. An inch board dries more than four times as\r\nfast as a four-inch plank, and more than twenty times as fast as a\r\nten-inch timber. White pine dries faster than oak. A very moist piece\r\nof pine or oak will, during one hour, lose more than four times as\r\nmuch water per square inch from the cross-section, but only one half\r\nas much from the tangential as from the radial section. In a long\r\ntimber, where the ends or cross-sections form but a small part of the\r\ndrying surface, this difference is not so evident. Nevertheless, the\r\nends dry and shrink first, and being opposed in this shrinkage by the\r\nmore moist adjoining parts, they check, the cracks largely\r\ndisappearing as seasoning progresses.\r\n\r\nHigh temperatures are very effective in evaporating the water from\r\nwood, no matter how humid the air, and a fresh piece of sapwood may\r\nlose weight in boiling water, and can be dried to quite an extent in\r\nhot steam.\r\n\r\nIn drying chemicals or fabrics, all that is required is to provide\r\nheat enough to vaporize the moisture and circulation enough to carry\r\noff the vapor thus secured, and the quickest and most economical means\r\nto these ends may be used. While on the other hand, in drying wood,\r\nwhether in the form of standard stock or the finished product, the\r\napplication of the requisite heat and circulation must be carefully\r\nregulated throughout the entire process, or warping and checking are\r\nalmost certain to result. Moreover, wood of different shapes and\r\nthicknesses is very differently effected by the same treatment.\r\nFinally, the tissues composing the wood, which vary in form and\r\nphysical properties, and which cross each other in regular directions,\r\nexert their own peculiar influences upon its behavior during drying.\r\nWith our native woods, for instance, summer-wood and spring-wood show\r\ndistinct tendencies in drying, and the same is true in a less degree\r\nof heartwood, as contrasted with sapwood. Or, again, pronounced\r\nmedullary rays further complicate the drying problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Physical Properties that influence Drying\r\n\r\nThe principal properties which render the drying of wood peculiarly\r\ndifficult are: (1) The irregular shrinkage; (2) the different ways in\r\nwhich water is contained; (3) the manner in which moisture transfuses\r\nthrough the wood from the center to the surface; (4) the plasticity of\r\nthe wood substance while moist and hot; (5) the changes which take\r\nplace in the hygroscopic and chemical nature of the surface; and (6)\r\nthe difference produced in the total shrinkage by different rates of\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\nThe shrinkage is unequal in different directions and in different\r\nportions of the same piece. It is greatest in the circumferential\r\ndirection of the tree, being generally twice as great in this\r\ndirection as in the radial direction. In the longitudinal direction,\r\nfor most woods, it is almost negligible, being from 20 to over 100\r\ntimes as great circumferentially as longitudinally.\r\n\r\nThere is a great variation in different species in this respect.\r\nConsequently, it follows from necessity that large internal strains\r\nare set up when the wood shrinks, and were it not for its plasticity\r\nit would rupture. There is an enormous difference in the total amount\r\nof shrinkage of different species of wood, varying from a shrinkage of\r\nonly 7 per cent in volume, based on the green dimensions, in the case\r\nof some of the cedars to nearly 50 per cent in the case of some\r\nspecies of eucalyptus.\r\n\r\nWhen the free water in the capillary spaces of the wood fibre is\r\nevaporated it follows the laws of evaporation from capillary spaces,\r\nexcept that the passages are not all free passages, and much of the\r\nwater has to pass out by a process of transfusion through the moist\r\ncell walls. These cell walls in the green wood completely surround the\r\ncell cavities so that there are no openings large enough to offer a\r\npassage to water or air.\r\n\r\nThe well-known \"pits\" in the cell walls extend through the secondary\r\nthickening only, and not through the primary walls. This statement\r\napplies to the tracheids and parenchyma cells in the conifer\r\n(gymnosperms), and to the tracheids, parenchyma cells, and the wood\r\nfibres in the broad-leaved trees (angiosperms); the vessels in the\r\nlatter, however, form open passages except when clogged by ingrowth\r\ncalled tyloses, and the resin canals in the former sometimes form\r\noccasional openings.\r\n\r\nBy heating the wood above the boiling point, corresponding to the\r\nexternal pressure, the free water passes through the cell walls more\r\nreadily.\r\n\r\nTo remove the moisture from the wood substance requires heat in\r\naddition to the latent heat of evaporation, because the molecules of\r\nmoisture are so intimately associated with the molecules, minute\r\nparticles composing the wood, that energy is required to separate them\r\ntherefrom.\r\n\r\nCarefully conducted experiments show this to be from 16.6 to 19.6\r\ncalories per grain of dry wood in the case of beech, long-leaf pine,\r\nand sugar maple.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty imposed in drying, however, is not so much the\r\nadditional heat required as it is in the rate at which the water\r\ntransfuses through the solid wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION VIII\r\n\r\n                        ADVANTAGES IN SEASONING\r\n\r\n\r\nThree most important advantages of seasoning have already been made\r\napparent:\r\n\r\n     1. Seasoned timber lasts much longer than unseasoned. Since\r\n     the decay of timber is due to the attacks of wood-destroying\r\n     fungi, and since the most important condition of the growth\r\n     of these fungi is water, anything which lessens the amount\r\n     of water in wood aids in its preservation.\r\n\r\n     2. In the case of treated timber, seasoning before treatment\r\n     greatly increases the effectiveness of the ordinary methods\r\n     of treatment, and seasoning after treatment prevents the\r\n     rapid leaching out of the salts introduced to preserve the\r\n     timber.\r\n\r\n     3. The saving in freight where timber is shipped from one\r\n     place to another. Few persons realize how much water green\r\n     wood contains, or how much it will lose in a comparatively\r\n     short time. Experiments along this line with lodge-pole\r\n     pine, white oak, and chestnut gave results which were a\r\n     surprise to the companies owning the timber.\r\n\r\nFreight charges vary considerably in different parts of the country;\r\nbut a decrease of 35 to 40 per cent in weight is important enough to\r\ndeserve everywhere serious consideration from those in charge of\r\ntimber operations.\r\n\r\nWhen timber is shipped long distances over several roads, as is coming\r\nto be more and more the case, the saving in freight will make a\r\nmaterial difference in the cost of lumber operations, irrespective of\r\nany other advantages of seasoning.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Prevention of Checking and Splitting\r\n\r\nUnder present methods much timber is rendered unfit for use by\r\nimproper seasoning. Green timber, particularly when cut during\r\nJanuary, February, and March, when the roots are most active, contains\r\na large amount of water. When exposed to the sun and wind or to high\r\ntemperatures in a drying room, the water will evaporate more rapidly\r\nfrom the outer than from the inner parts of the piece, and more\r\nrapidly from the ends than from the sides. As the water evaporates,\r\nthe wood shrinks, and when the shrinkage is not fairly uniform the\r\nwood cracks and splits.\r\n\r\nWhen wet wood is piled in the sun, evaporation goes on with such\r\nunevenness that the timbers split and crack in some cases so badly as\r\nto become useless for the purpose for which it was intended. Such\r\nuneven drying can be prevented by careful piling, keeping the logs\r\nimmersed in a log pond until wanted, or by piling or storing under an\r\nopen shed so that the sun cannot get at them.\r\n\r\nExperiments have also demonstrated that injury to stock in the way of\r\nchecking and splitting always develops immediately after the stock is\r\ntaken into the dry kiln, and is due to the degree of humidity being\r\ntoo low.\r\n\r\nThe receiving end of the kiln should always be kept moist, where the\r\nstock has not been steamed before being put into the kiln, as when the\r\nair is too dry it tends to dry the outside of the stock first--which\r\nis termed \"case-hardening\"--and in so doing shrinks and closes up the\r\npores. As the material is moved down the kiln (as in the case of\r\n\"progressive kilns\"), it absorbs a continually increasing amount of\r\nheat, which tends to drive off the moisture still present in the\r\ncenter of the piece, the pores on the outside having been closed up,\r\nthere is no exit for the vapor or steam that is being rapidly formed\r\nin the center of the piece. It must find its way out in some manner,\r\nand in doing so sets up strains, which result either in checking or\r\nsplitting. If the humidity had been kept higher, the outside of the\r\npiece would not have dried so quickly, and the pores would have\r\nremained open for the exit of the moisture from the interior of the\r\npiece, and this trouble would have been avoided. (See also article\r\nfollowing.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Shrinkage of Wood\r\n\r\nSince in all our woods, cells with thick walls and cells with thin\r\nwalls are more or less intermixed, and especially as the spring-wood\r\nand summer-wood nearly always differ from each other in this respect,\r\nstrains and tendencies to warp are always active when wood dries out,\r\nbecause the summer-wood shrinks more than the spring-wood, and heavier\r\nwood in general shrinks more than light wood of the same kind.\r\n\r\nIf a thin piece of wood after drying is placed upon a moist surface,\r\nthe cells on the under side of the piece take up moisture and swell\r\nbefore the upper cells receive any moisture. This causes the under\r\nside of the piece to become longer than the upper side, and as a\r\nconsequence warping occurs. Soon, however, the moisture penetrates to\r\nall the cells and the piece straightens out. But while a thin board of\r\npine curves laterally it remains quite straight lengthwise, since in\r\nthis direction both shrinkage and swelling are small. If one side of a\r\ngreen board is exposed to the sun, warping is produced by the removal\r\nof water and consequent shrinkage of the side exposed; this may be\r\neliminated by the frequent turning of the topmost pieces of the piles\r\nin order that they may be dried evenly.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, wood loses water faster from the ends than from the\r\nlongitudinal faces. Hence the ends shrink at a different rate from the\r\ninterior parts. The faster the drying at the surface, the greater is\r\nthe difference in the moisture of the different parts, and hence the\r\ngreater the strains and consequently also the greater amount of\r\nchecking. This becomes very evident when freshly cut wood is placed in\r\nthe sun, and still more when put into a hot, dry kiln. While most of\r\nthese smaller checks are only temporary, closing up again, some large\r\nradial checks remain and even grow larger as drying progresses. Their\r\ncause is a different one and will presently be explained. The\r\ntemporary checks not only appear at the ends, but are developed on\r\nthe sides also, only to a much smaller degree. They become especially\r\nannoying on the surface of thick planks of hardwoods, and also on\r\npeeled logs when exposed to the sun.\r\n\r\nSo far we have considered the wood as if made up only of parallel\r\nfibres all placed longitudinally in the log. This, however, is not the\r\ncase. A large part of the wood is formed by the medullary or pith\r\nrays. In pine over 15,000 of these occur on a square inch of a\r\ntangential section, and even in oak the very large rays, which are\r\nreadily visible to the eye, represent scarcely a hundredth part of the\r\nnumber which a microscope reveals, as the cells of these rays have\r\ntheir length at right angles to the direction of the wood fibres.\r\n\r\nIf a large pith ray of white oak is whittled out and allowed to dry,\r\nit is found to shrink greatly in its width, while, as we have stated,\r\nthe fibres to which the ray is firmly grown in the wood do not shrink\r\nin the same direction. Therefore, in the wood, as the cells of the\r\npith ray dry they pull on the longitudinal fibres and try to shorten\r\nthem, and, being opposed by the rigidity of the fibres, the pith ray\r\nis greatly strained. But this is not the only strain it has to bear.\r\nSince the fibres shrink as much again as the pith ray, in this its\r\nlongitudinal direction, the fibres tend to shorten the ray, and the\r\nlatter in opposing this prevents the former from shrinking as much as\r\nthey otherwise would.\r\n\r\nThus the structure is subjected to two severe strains at right angles\r\nto each other, and herein lies the greatest difficulty of wood\r\nseasoning, for whenever the wood dries rapidly these fibres have not\r\nthe chance to \"give\" or accommodate themselves, and hence fibres and\r\npith rays separate and checking results, which, whether visible or\r\nnot, are detrimental in the use of the wood.\r\n\r\nThe contraction of the pith rays parallel to the length of the board\r\nis probably one of the causes of the small amount of longitudinal\r\nshrinkage which has been observed in boards. This smaller shrinkage of\r\nthe pith rays along the radius of the log (the length of the pith\r\nray), opposing the shrinkage of the fibres in this direction, becomes\r\none of the causes of the second great trouble in wood seasoning,\r\nnamely, the difference in the shrinkage along the radius and that\r\nalong the rings or tangent. This greater tangential shrinkage appears\r\nto be due in part to the causes just mentioned, but also to the fact\r\nthat the greatly shrinking bands of summer-wood are interrupted along\r\nthe radius by as many bands of porous spring-wood, while they are\r\ncontinuous in the tangential direction. In this direction, therefore,\r\neach such band tends to shrink, as if the entire piece were composed\r\nof summer-wood, and since the summer-wood represents the greater part\r\nof the wood substance, this greater tendency to tangential shrinkage\r\nprevails.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this greater tangential shrinkage effects every phase of\r\nwoodworking. It leads to permanent checks and causes the log or piece\r\nto split open on drying. Sawed in two, the flat sides of the log\r\nbecome convex; sawed into timber, it checks along the median line of\r\nthe four faces, and if converted into boards, the latter checks\r\nconsiderably from the end through the center, all owing to the greater\r\ntangential shrinkage of the wood.\r\n\r\nBriefly, then, shrinkage of wood is due to the fact that the cell\r\nwalls grow thinner on drying. The thicker cell walls and therefore the\r\nheavier wood shrinks most, while the water in the cell cavities does\r\nnot influence the volume of the wood.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great difference of cells in shape, size, and thickness\r\nof walls, and still more in their arrangement, shrinkage is not\r\nuniform in any kind of wood. This irregularity produces strains, which\r\ngrow with the difference between adjoining cells and are greatest at\r\nthe pith rays. These strains cause warping and checking, but exist\r\neven where no outward signs are visible. They are greater if the wood\r\nis dried rapidly than if dried slowly, but can never be entirely\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nTemporary checks are caused by the more rapid drying of the outer\r\nparts of any stick; permanent checks are due to the greater shrinkage,\r\ntangentially, along the rings than along the radius. This, too, is the\r\ncause of most of the ordinary phenomena of shrinkage, such as the\r\ndifference in behavior of the entire and quartered logs, \"bastard\"\r\n(tangent) and rift (radial) boards, etc., and explains many of the\r\nphenomena erroneously attributed to the influence of bark, or of the\r\ngreater shrinkage of outer and inner parts of any log.\r\n\r\nOnce dry, wood may be swelled again to its original size by soaking in\r\nwater, boiling, or steaming. Soaked pieces on drying shrink again as\r\nbefore; boiled and steamed pieces do the same, but to a slightly less\r\ndegree. Neither hygroscopicity, _i.e._, the capacity of taking up\r\nwater, nor shrinkage of wood can be overcome by drying at temperatures\r\nbelow 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Higher temperatures, however, reduce\r\nthese qualities, but nothing short of a coaling heat robs wood of the\r\ncapacity to shrink and swell.\r\n\r\nRapidly dried in a kiln, the wood of oak and other hardwoods\r\n\"case-harden,\" that is, the outer part dries and shrinks before the\r\ninterior has a chance to do the same, and thus forms a firm shell or\r\ncase of shrunken, commonly checked wood around the interior. This\r\nshell does not prevent the interior from drying, but when this drying\r\noccurs the interior is commonly checked along the medullary rays,\r\ncommonly called \"honeycombing\" or \"hollow-horning.\" In practice this\r\noccurrence can be prevented by steaming or sweating the wood in the\r\nkiln, and still better by drying the wood in the open air or in a shed\r\nbefore placing in the kiln. Since only the first shrinkage is apt to\r\ncheck the wood, any kind of lumber which has once been air-dried\r\n(three to six months for one-inch stuff) may be subjected to kiln heat\r\nwithout any danger from this source.\r\n\r\nKept in a bent or warped condition during the first shrinkage, the\r\nwood retains the shape to which it has been bent and firmly opposes\r\nany attempt at subsequent straightening.\r\n\r\nSapwood, as a rule, shrinks more than heartwood of the same weight,\r\nbut very heavy heartwood may shrink more than lighter sapwood. The\r\namount of water in wood is no criterion of its shrinkage, since in wet\r\nwood most of the water is held in the cavities, where it has no effect\r\non the volume.\r\n\r\nThe wood of pine, spruce, cypress, etc., with its very regular\r\nstructure, dries and shrinks evenly, and suffers much less in\r\nseasoning than the wood of broad-leaved (hardwood) trees. Among the\r\nlatter, oak is the most difficult to dry without injury.\r\n\r\nDesiccating the air with certain chemicals will cause the wood to dry,\r\nbut wood thus dried at 80 degrees Fahrenheit will still lose water in\r\nthe kiln. Wood dried at 120 degrees Fahrenheit loses water still if\r\ndried at 200 degrees Fahrenheit, and this again will lose more water\r\nif the temperature be raised, so that _absolutely dry wood_ cannot be\r\nobtained, and chemical destruction sets in before all the water is\r\ndriven off.\r\n\r\nOn removal from the kiln, the dry wood at once takes up moisture from\r\nthe air, even in the driest weather. At first the absorption is quite\r\nrapid; at the end of a week a short piece of pine, 1-1/2 inches thick,\r\nhas regained two thirds of, and, in a few months, all the moisture\r\nwhich it had when air-dry, 8 to 10 per cent, and also its former\r\ndimensions. In thin boards all parts soon attain the same degree of\r\ndryness. In heavy timbers the interior remains more moist for many\r\nmonths, and even years, than the exterior parts. Finally an\r\nequilibrium is reached, and then only the outer parts change with the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nWith kiln-dried woods all parts are equally dry, and when exposed, the\r\nmoisture coming from the air must pass through the outer parts, and\r\nthus the order is reversed. Ordinary timber requires months before it\r\nis at its best. Kiln-dried timber, if properly handled, is prime at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nDry wood if soaked in water soon regains its original volume, and in\r\nthe heartwood portion it may even surpass it; that is to say, swell to\r\na larger dimension than it had when green. With the soaking it\r\ncontinues to increase in weight, the cell cavities filling with water,\r\nand if left many months all pieces sink. Yet after a year's immersion\r\na piece of oak 2 by 2 inches and only 6 inches long still contains\r\nair; _i.e._, it has not taken up all the water it can. By rafting or\r\nprolonged immersion, wood loses some of its weight, soluble materials\r\nbeing leached out, but it is not impaired either as fuel or as\r\nbuilding material. Immersion, and still more boiling and steaming,\r\nreduce the hygroscopicity of wood and therefore also the troublesome\r\n\"working,\" or shrinking and swelling.\r\n\r\nExposure in dry air to a temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit for a\r\nshort time reduces but does not destroy the hygroscopicity, and with\r\nit the tendency to shrink and swell. A piece of red oak which has been\r\nsubjected to a temperature of over 300 degrees Fahrenheit still swells\r\nin hot water and shrinks in a dry kiln.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Expansion of Wood\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that timber, in common with every other\r\nmaterial, expands as well as contracts. If we extract the moisture\r\nfrom a piece of wood and so cause it to shrink, it may be swelled to\r\nits original volume by soaking it in water, but owing to the\r\nprotection given to most timber in dwelling-houses it is not much\r\naffected by wet or damp weather. The shrinkage is more apparent, more\r\nlasting, and of more consequence to the architect, builder, or owner\r\nthan the slight expansion which takes place, as, although the amount\r\nof moisture contained in wood varies with the climate conditions, the\r\nconsequence of dampness or moisture on good timber used in houses only\r\nmakes itself apparent by the occasional jamming of a door or window in\r\nwet or damp weather.\r\n\r\nConsiderable expansion, however, takes place in the wood-paving of\r\nstreets, and when this form of paving was in its infancy much trouble\r\noccurred owing to all allowances not having been made for this\r\ncontingency, the trouble being doubtless increased owing to the blocks\r\nnot being properly seasoned; curbing was lifted or pushed out of line\r\nand gully grids were broken by this action. As a rule in street paving\r\na space of one or two inches wide is now left next to the curb, which\r\nis filled with sand or some soft material, so that the blocks may\r\nexpand longitudinally without injuring the contour or affecting the\r\ncurbs. But even with this arrangement it is not at all unusual for an\r\ninch or more to have to be cut off paving blocks parallel to the\r\nchannels some time after the paving has been laid, owing to the\r\nexpansion of the wood exceeding the amounts allowed.\r\n\r\nConsiderable variation occurs in the expansion of wood blocks, and it\r\nis noticeable in the hardwoods as well as in the softwoods, and is\r\noften greater in the former than in the latter.\r\n\r\nExpansion takes place in the direction of the length of the blocks as\r\nthey are laid across the street, and causes no trouble in the other\r\ndirection, the reason being that the lengthway of a block of wood is\r\nacross the grain, of the timber, and it expands or contracts as a\r\nplank does. On one occasion, in a roadway forty feet wide, expansion\r\noccurred until it amounted to four inches on each side, or eight\r\ninches in all. This continual expansion and contraction is doubtless\r\nthe cause of a considerable amount of wood street-paving bulging and\r\nbecoming filled with ridges and depressions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Elimination of Stain and Mildew\r\n\r\nA great many manufacturers, and particularly those located in the\r\nSouthern States, experience a great amount of difficulty in their\r\ntimber becoming stained and mildewed. This is particularly true with\r\ngum wood, as it will frequently stain and mould in twenty-four hours,\r\nand they have experienced so much of this trouble that they have, in a\r\ngreat many instances, discontinued cutting it during the summer\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nIf this matter were given proper attention they should be able to\r\neliminate a great deal of this difficulty, as no doubt they will find\r\nafter investigation that the mould has been caused by the stock being\r\nimproperly piled to the weather.\r\n\r\nFreshly sawn wood, placed in close piles during warm, damp weather in\r\nthe months of July and August, presents especially favorable\r\nconditions for mould and stain. In all cases it is the moist condition\r\nand retarded drying of the wood which causes this. Therefore, any\r\nmethod which will provide for the rapid drying of the wood before or\r\nafter piling will tend to prevent the difficulty, and the best method\r\nfor eliminating mould is (1) to provide for as little delay as\r\npossible between the felling of the tree, and its manufacture into\r\nrough products before the sap has had an opportunity of becoming sour.\r\nThis is especially necessary with trees felled from April to\r\nSeptember, in the region north of the Gulf States, and from March to\r\nNovember in the latter, while the late fall and winter cutting should\r\nall be worked up by March or April. (2) The material should be piled\r\nto the weather immediately after being sawn or cut, and every\r\nprecaution should be taken in piling to facilitate rapid drying, by\r\nkeeping the piles or ricks up off the ground. (3) All weeds (and\r\nemphasis should be placed on the ALL) and other vegetation should be\r\nkept well clear of the piles, in order that the air may have a clear\r\nand unobstructed passage through and around the piles, and (4) the\r\npiles should be so constructed that each stick or piece will have as\r\nmuch air space about it as it is possible to give to it.\r\n\r\nIf the above instructions are properly carried out, there will be\r\nlittle or no difficulty experienced with mould appearing on the\r\nlumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION IX\r\n\r\n                      DIFFICULTIES OF DRYING WOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nSeasoning and kiln-drying is so important a process in the manufacture\r\nof woods that a need is keenly felt for fuller information regarding\r\nit, based upon scientific study of the behavior of various species at\r\ndifferent mechanical temperatures and under different mechanical\r\ndrying processes. The special precautions necessary to prevent loss of\r\nstrength or distortion of shape render the drying of wood especially\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nAll wood when undergoing a seasoning process, either natural (by air)\r\nor mechanical (by steam or heat in a dry kiln), checks or splits more\r\nor less. This is due to the uneven drying-out of the wood and the\r\nconsequent strains exerted in opposite directions by the wood fibres\r\nin shrinking. This shrinkage, it has been proven, takes place both\r\nend-wise and across the grain of the wood. The old tradition that wood\r\ndoes not shrink end-wise has long since been shattered, and it has\r\nlong been demonstrated that there is an end-wise shrinkage.\r\n\r\nIn some woods it is very light, while in others it is easily\r\nperceptible. It is claimed that the average end shrinkage, taking all\r\nthe woods, is only about 1-1/2 per cent. This, however, probably has\r\nrelation to the average shrinkage on ordinary lumber as it is used and\r\ncut and dried. Now if we depart from this and take veneer, or basket\r\nstock, or even stave bolts where they are boiled, causing swelling\r\nboth end-wise and across the grain or in dimension, after they are\r\nthoroughly dried, there is considerably more evidence of end\r\nshrinkage. In other words, a slack barrel stave of elm, say, 28 or 30\r\ninches in length, after being boiled might shrink as much in\r\nthoroughly drying-out as compared to its length when freshly cut, as a\r\n12-foot elm board.\r\n\r\nIt is in cutting veneer that this end shrinkage becomes most readily\r\napparent. In trimming with scoring knives it is done to exact measure,\r\nand where stock is cut to fit some specific place there has been\r\nobserved a shrinkage on some of the softer woods, like cottonwood,\r\namounting to fully 1/8 of an inch in 36 inches. And at times where\r\ndrying has been thorough the writer has noted a shrinkage of 1/8 of an\r\ninch on an ordinary elm cabbage-crate strip 36 inches long, sawed from\r\nthe log without boiling.\r\n\r\nThere are really no fixed rules of measurement or allowance, however,\r\nbecause the same piece of wood may vary under different conditions,\r\nand, again, the grain may cross a little or wind around the tree, and\r\nthis of itself has a decided effect on the amount of what is termed\r\n\"end shrinkage.\"\r\n\r\nThere is more checking in the wood of the broad-leaf (hardwood) trees\r\nthan in that of the coniferous (softwood) trees, more in sapwood than\r\nin heartwood, and more in summer-wood than in spring-wood.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as under normal conditions of weather, water evaporates less\r\nrapidly during the early seasoning of winter, wood that is cut in the\r\nautumn and early winter is considered less subject to checking than\r\nthat which is cut in spring and summer.\r\n\r\nRapid seasoning, except after wood has been thoroughly soaked or\r\nsteamed, almost invariably results in more or less serious checking.\r\nAll hardwoods which check or warp badly during the seasoning should be\r\nreduced to the smallest practicable size before drying to avoid the\r\ninjuries involved in this process, and wood once seasoned _should\r\nnever again be exposed to the weather_, since all injuries due to\r\nseasoning are thereby aggravated.\r\n\r\nSeasoning increases the strength of wood in every respect, and it is\r\ntherefore of great importance to protect the wood against moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Changes rendering Drying difficult\r\n\r\nAn important property rendering drying of wood peculiarly difficult is\r\nthe changes which occur in the hygroscopic properties of the surface\r\nof a stick, and the rate at which it will allow moisture to pass\r\nthrough it. If wood is dried rapidly the surface soon reaches a\r\ncondition where the transfusion is greatly hindered and sometimes\r\nappears almost to cease. The nature of this action is not well\r\nunderstood and it differs greatly in different species. Bald cypress\r\n(_Taxodium distichum_) is an example in which this property is\r\nparticularly troublesome. The difficulty can be overcome by regulating\r\nthe humidity during the drying operation. It is one of the factors\r\nentering into production of what is called \"case-hardening\" of wood,\r\nwhere the surface of the piece becomes hardened in a stretched or\r\nexpanded condition, and subsequent shrinkage of the interior causes\r\n\"honeycombing,\" \"hollow-horning,\" or internal checking. The outer\r\nsurface of the wood appears to undergo a chemical change in the nature\r\nof hydrolization or oxidization, which alters the rate of absorption\r\nand evaporation in the air.\r\n\r\nAs the total amount of shrinkage varies with the rate at which the\r\nwood is dried, it follows that the outer surface of a rapidly dried\r\nboard shrinks less than the interior. This sets up an internal stress,\r\nwhich, if the board be afterward resawed into two thinner boards by\r\nslicing it through the middle, causes the two halves to cup with their\r\nconvex surfaces outward. This effect may occur even though the\r\nmoisture distribution in the board has reached a uniform condition,\r\nand the board is thoroughly dry before it is resawed. It is distinct\r\nfrom the well-known \"case-hardening\" effect spoken of above, which is\r\ncaused by unequal moisture conditions.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the water passes from the interior of a piece of\r\nwood to its surface has not as yet been fully determined, although it\r\nis one of the most important factors which influence drying. This must\r\ninvolve a transfusion of moisture through the cell walls, since, as\r\nalready mentioned, except for the open vessels in the hardwoods, free\r\nresin ducts in the softwoods, and possibly the intercellular spaces,\r\nthe cells of green wood are enclosed by membranes and the water must\r\npass through the walls or the membranes of the pits. Heat appears to\r\nincrease this transfusion, but experimental data are lacking.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that to dry wood properly a great many factors must be\r\ntaken into consideration aside from the mere evaporation of moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Losses Due to Improper Kiln-drying\r\n\r\nIn some cases there is practically no loss in drying, but more often\r\nit ranges from 1 to 3 per cent, and 7 to 10 per cent in refractory\r\nwoods such as gum. In exceptional instances the losses are as high as\r\n33 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn air-drying there is little or no control over the process; it may\r\ntake place too rapidly on some days and too slowly on others, and it\r\nmay be very non-uniform.\r\n\r\nHardwoods in large sizes almost invariably check.\r\n\r\nBy proper kiln-drying these unfavorable circumstances may be\r\neliminated. However, air-drying is unquestionably to be preferred to\r\nbad kiln-drying, and when there is any doubt in the case it is\r\ngenerally safer to trust to air-drying.\r\n\r\nIf the fundamental principles are all taken care of, green lumber can\r\nbe better dried in the dry kiln.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Properties of Wood that affect Drying\r\n\r\nIt is clear, from the previous discussion of the structure of wood,\r\nthat this property is of first importance among those influencing the\r\nseasoning of wood. The free water way usually be extracted quite\r\nreadily from porous hardwoods. The presence of tyloses in white oak\r\nmakes even this a difficult problem. On the other hand, its more\r\ncomplex structure usually renders the hygroscopic moisture quite\r\ndifficult to extract.\r\n\r\nThe lack of an open, porous structure renders the transfusion of\r\nmoisture through some woods very slow, while the reverse may be true\r\nof other species. The point of interest is that all the different\r\nvariations in structure affect the drying rates of woods. The\r\nstructure of the gums suggests relatively easy seasoning.\r\n\r\nShrinkage is a very important factor affecting the drying of woods.\r\nGenerally speaking, the greater the shrinkage the more difficult it is\r\nto dry wood. Wood shrinks about twice as much tangentially as\r\nradially, thus introducing very serious stresses which may cause loss\r\nin woods whose total shrinkage is large. It has been found that the\r\namount of shrinkage depends, to some extent, on the rate and\r\ntemperature at which woods season. Rapid drying at high or low\r\ntemperature results in slight shrinkage, while slow drying, especially\r\nat high temperature, increases the shrinkage.\r\n\r\nAs some woods must be dried in one way and others in other ways, to\r\nobtain the best general results, this effect may be for the best in\r\none case and the reverse in others. As an example one might cite the\r\ncase of Southern white oak. This species must be dried very slowly at\r\nlow temperatures in order to avoid the many evils to which it is heir.\r\nIt is interesting to note that this method tends to increase the\r\nshrinkage, so that one might logically expect such treatment merely to\r\naggravate the evils. Such is not the case, however, as too fast drying\r\nresults in other defects much worse than that of excessive shrinkage.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the shrinkage of any given species of wood depends to\r\na great extent on the method of drying. Just how much the shrinkage of\r\ngum is affected by the temperature and drying rate is not known at\r\npresent. There is no doubt that the method of seasoning affects the\r\nshrinkage of the gums, however. It is just possible that these woods\r\nmay shrink longitudinally more than is normal, thus furnishing another\r\ncause for their peculiar action under certain circumstances. It has\r\nbeen found that the properties of wood which affect the seasoning of\r\nthe gums are, in the order of their importance: (1) The indeterminate\r\nand erratic grain; (2) the uneven shrinkage with the resultant\r\nopposing stresses; (3) the plasticity under high temperature while\r\nmoist; and (4) the slight apparent lack of cohesion between the\r\nfibres. The first, second, and fourth properties are clearly\r\ndetrimental, while the third may possibly be an advantage in reducing\r\nchecking and \"case-hardening.\"\r\n\r\nThe grain of the wood is a prominent factor also affecting the\r\nproblem. It is this factor, coupled with uneven shrinkage, which is\r\nprobably responsible, to a large extent, for the action of the gums in\r\ndrying. The grain may be said to be more or less indeterminate. It is\r\nusually spiral, and the spiral may reverse from year to year of the\r\ntree's growth. When a board in which this condition exists begins to\r\nshrink, the result is the development of opposing stresses, the effect\r\nof which is sometimes disastrous. The shrinkage around the knots seems\r\nto be particularly uneven, so that checking at the knots is quite\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nSome woods, such as Western red cedar, redwood, and eucalyptus, become\r\nvery plastic when hot and moist. The result of drying-out the free\r\nwater at high temperature may be to collapse the cells. The gums are\r\nknown to be quite soft and plastic, if they are moist, at high\r\ntemperature, but they do not collapse so far as we have been able to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nThe cells of certain species of wood appear to lack cohesion,\r\nespecially at the junction between the annual rings. As a result,\r\nchecks and ring shakes are very common in Western larch and hemlock.\r\nThe parenchyma cells of the medullary rays in oak do not cohere\r\nstrongly and often check open, especially when steamed too severely.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Unsolved Problems in Kiln-drying\r\n\r\n     1. Physical data of the properties of wood in relation to\r\n     heat are meagre.\r\n\r\n     2. Figures on the specific heat of wood are not readily\r\n     available, though upon this rests not only the exact\r\n     operation of heating coils for kilns, but the theory of\r\n     kiln-drying as a whole.\r\n\r\n     3. Great divergence is shown in the results of experiments\r\n     in the conductivity of wood. It remains to be seen whether\r\n     the known variation of conductivity with moisture content\r\n     will reduce these results to uniformity.\r\n\r\n     4. The maximum or highest temperature to which the different\r\n     species of wood may be exposed without serious loss of\r\n     strength has not yet been determined.\r\n\r\n     5. The optimum or absolute correct temperature for drying\r\n     the different species of wood is as yet entirely unsettled.\r\n\r\n     6. The inter-relation between wood and water is as\r\n     imperfectly known to dry-kiln operators as that between wood\r\n     and heat.\r\n\r\n     7. What moisture conditions obtain in a stick of air-dried\r\n     wood?\r\n\r\n     8. How is the moisture distinguished?\r\n\r\n     9. What is its form?\r\n\r\n     10. What is the meaning of the peculiar surface conditions\r\n     which even in air-dried wood appear to indicate incipient\r\n     \"case-hardening\"?\r\n\r\n     11. The manner in which the water passes from the interior\r\n     of a piece of wood to its surface has not as yet been fully\r\n     determined.\r\n\r\nThese questions can be answered thus far only by speculation or, at\r\nbest, on the basis of incomplete data.\r\n\r\nUntil these problems are solved, kiln-drying must necessarily remain\r\nwithout the guidance of complete scientific theory.\r\n\r\nA correct understanding of the principles of drying is rare, and\r\nopinions in regard to the subject are very diverse. The same lack of\r\nknowledge exists in regard to dry kilns. The physical properties of\r\nthe wood which complicate the drying operation and render it distinct\r\nfrom that of merely evaporating free water from some substance like a\r\npiece of cloth must be studied experimentally. It cannot well be\r\nworked out theoretically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SECTION X\r\n\r\n                         HOW WOOD IS SEASONED\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Methods of Drying\r\n\r\nThe choice of a method of drying depends largely upon the object in\r\nview. The principal objects may be grouped under three main heads, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     1. To reduce shipping weight.\r\n\r\n     2. To reduce the quantity necessary to carry in stock.\r\n\r\n     3. To prepare the wood for its ultimate use and improve its\r\n     qualities.\r\n\r\nWhen wood will stand the temperature without excessive checking or\r\nundue shrinkage or loss in strength, the first object is most readily\r\nattained by heating the wood above the boiling point in a closed\r\nchamber, with a large circulation of air or vapor, so arranged that\r\nthe excess steam produced will escape. This process manifestly does\r\nnot apply to many of the hardwoods, but is applicable to many of the\r\nsoftwoods. It is used especially in the northwestern part of the\r\nUnited States, where Douglas fir boards one inch thick are dried in\r\nfrom 40 to 65 hours, and sometimes in as short a time as 24 hours. In\r\nthe latter case superheated steam at 300 degrees Fahrenheit was forced\r\ninto the chamber but, of course, the lumber could not be heated\r\nthereby much above the boiling point so long as it contained any free\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThis lumber, however, contained but 34 per cent moisture to start\r\nwith, and the most rapid rate was 1.6 per cent loss per hour.\r\n\r\nThe heat of evaporation may be supplied either by superheated steam or\r\nby steam pipes within the kiln itself.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of wood it is necessary to carry in stock is naturally\r\nreduced when either of the other two objects is attained and,\r\ntherefore, need not necessarily be discussed.\r\n\r\nIn drying to prepare for use and to improve quality, careful and\r\nscientific drying is called for. This applies more particularly to the\r\nhardwoods, although it may be required for softwoods also.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Drying at Atmospheric Pressure\r\n\r\nPresent practice of kiln-drying varies tremendously and there is no\r\nuniformity or standard method.\r\n\r\nTemperatures vary anywhere from 65 to 165 degrees Fahrenheit, or even\r\nhigher, and inch boards three to six months on the sticks are being\r\ndried in from four days to three weeks, and three-inch material in\r\nfrom two to five months.\r\n\r\nAll methods in use at atmospheric pressure may be classified under the\r\nfollowing headings. The kilns may be either progressive or\r\ncompartment, and preliminary steaming may or may not be used with any\r\none of these methods:\r\n\r\n     1. Dry air heated. This is generally obsolete.\r\n     2. Moist air.\r\n         _a._ Ventilated.\r\n         _b._ Forced draft.\r\n         _c._ Condensing.\r\n         _d._ Humidity regulated.\r\n         _e._ Boiling.\r\n     3. Superheated steam.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Drying under Pressure and Vacuum\r\n\r\nVarious methods of drying wood under pressures other than atmospheric\r\nhave been tried. Only a brief mention of this subject will be made.\r\nWhere the apparatus is available probably the quickest way to dry wood\r\nis first to heat it in saturated steam at as high a temperature as the\r\nspecies can endure without serious chemical change until the heat has\r\npenetrated to the center, then follow this with a vacuum.\r\n\r\nBy this means the self-contained specific heat of the wood and the\r\nwater is made available for the evaporation, and the drying takes\r\nplace from the inside outwardly, just the reverse of that which occurs\r\nby drying by means of external heat.\r\n\r\nWhen the specimen has cooled this process is then to be repeated until\r\nit has dried down to fibre-saturation point. It cannot be dried much\r\nbelow this point by this method, since the absorption during the\r\nheating operation will then equal the evaporation during the cooling.\r\nIt may be carried further, however, by heating in partially humidified\r\nair, proportioning the relative humidity each time it is heated to the\r\ndegree of moisture present in the wood.\r\n\r\nThe point to be considered in this operation is that during the\r\nheating process no evaporation shall be allowed to take place, but\r\nonly during the cooling. In this way surface drying and\r\n\"case-hardening\" are prevented since the heat is from within and the\r\nmoisture passes from the inside outwardly. However, with some species,\r\nnotably oak, surface cracks appear as a network of fine checks along\r\nthe medullary rays.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it should be borne in mind that it is the heat\r\nwhich produces evaporation and not the air nor any mysterious property\r\nassigned to a \"vacuum.\"\r\n\r\nFor every pound of water evaporated at ordinary temperatures\r\napproximately 1,000 British thermal units of heat are used up, or\r\n\"become latent,\" as it is called. This is true whether the evaporation\r\ntakes place in a vacuum or under a moderate air pressure. If this heat\r\nis not supplied from an outside source it must be supplied by the\r\nwater itself (or the material being dried), the temperature of which\r\nwill consequently fall until the surrounding space becomes saturated\r\nwith vapor at a pressure corresponding to the temperature which the\r\nwater has reached; evaporation will then cease. The pressure of the\r\nvapor in a space saturated with water vapor increases rapidly with\r\nincrease of temperature. At a so-called vacuum of 28 inches, which is\r\nabout the limit in commercial operations, and in reality signifies an\r\nactual pressure of 2 inches of mercury column, the space will be\r\nsaturated with vapor at 101 degrees Fahrenheit. Consequently, no\r\nevaporation will take place in such a vacuum unless the water be\r\nwarmer than 101 degrees Fahrenheit, provided there is no air leakage.\r\nThe qualification in regard to air is necessary, for the sake of\r\nexactness, for the following reason: In any given space the total\r\nactual pressure is made up of the combined pressures of all the gases\r\npresent. If the total pressure (\"vacuum\") is 2 inches, and there is no\r\nair present, it is all produced by the water vapor (which saturates\r\nthe space at 101 degrees Fahrenheit); but if some air is present and\r\nthe total pressure is still maintained at 2 inches, then there must be\r\nless vapor present, since the air is producing part of the pressure\r\nand the space is no longer saturated at the given temperature.\r\nConsequently further evaporation may occur, with a corresponding\r\nlowering of the temperature of the water, until a balance is again\r\nreached. Without further explanation it is easy to see that but little\r\nwater can be evaporated by a vacuum alone without addition of heat,\r\nand that the prevalent idea that a vacuum can of itself produce\r\nevaporation is a fallacy. If heat be supplied to the water, however,\r\neither by conduction or radiation, evaporation will take place in\r\ndirect proportion to the amount of heat supplied, so long as the\r\npressure is kept down by the vacuum pump.\r\n\r\nAt 30 inches of mercury pressure (one atmosphere) the space becomes\r\nsaturated with vapor and equilibrium is established at 212 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. If heat be now supplied to the water, however, evaporation\r\nwill take place in proportion to the amount of heat supplied, so long\r\nas the pressure remains that of one atmosphere, just as in the case of\r\nthe vacuum. Evaporation in this condition, where the vapor pressure at\r\nthe temperature of the water is equal to the gas pressure on the\r\nwater, is commonly called \"boiling,\" and the saturated vapor entirely\r\ndisplaces the air under continuous operation. Whenever the space is\r\nnot saturated with vapor, whether air is present or not, evaporation\r\nwill take place, by boiling if no air be present or by diffusion under\r\nthe presence of air, until an equilibrium between temperature and\r\nvapor pressure is resumed.\r\n\r\nRelative humidity is simply the ratio of the actual vapor pressure\r\npresent in a given space to the vapor pressure when the space is\r\nsaturated with vapor at the given temperature. It matters not whether\r\nair be present or not. One hundred per cent humidity means that the\r\nspace contains all the vapor which it can hold at the given\r\ntemperature--it is saturated. Thus at 100 per cent humidity and 212\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit the space is saturated, and since the pressure of\r\nsaturated vapor at this temperature is one atmosphere, no air can be\r\npresent under these conditions. If, however, the total pressure at\r\nthis temperature were 20 pounds (5 pounds gauge), then it would mean\r\nthat there was 5 pounds air pressure present in addition to the vapor,\r\nyet the space would still be saturated at the given temperature.\r\nAgain, if the temperature were 101 degrees Fahrenheit, the pressure of\r\nsaturated vapor would be only 1 pound, and the additional pressure of\r\n14 pounds, if the total pressure were atmospheric, would be made up of\r\nair. In order to have no air present and the space still saturated at\r\n101 degrees Fahrenheit, the total pressure must be reduced to 1 pound\r\nby a vacuum pump. Fifty per cent relative humidity, therefore,\r\nsignifies that only half the amount of vapor required to saturate the\r\nspace at the given temperature is present. Thus at 212 degrees\r\nFahrenheit temperature the vapor pressure would only be 7-1/2 pounds\r\n(vacuum of 15 inches gauge). If the total pressure were atmospheric,\r\nthen the additional 7-1/2 pounds would be simply air.\r\n\r\n\"Live steam\" is simply water-saturated vapor at a pressure usually\r\nabove atmospheric. We may just as truly have live steam at pressures\r\nless than atmospheric, at a vacuum of 28 inches for instance. Only in\r\nthe latter case its temperature would be lower, _viz._, 101 degrees\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\nSuperheated steam is nothing more than water vapor at a relative\r\nhumidity less than saturation, but is usually considered at pressures\r\nabove atmospheric, and in the absence of air. The atmosphere at, say,\r\n50 per cent relative humidity really contains superheated steam or\r\nvapor, the only difference being that it is at a lower temperature and\r\npressure than we are accustomed to think of in speaking of superheated\r\nsteam, and it has air mixed with it to make up the deficiency in\r\npressure below the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nTwo things should now be clear; that evaporation is produced by heat\r\nand that the presence or absence of air does not influence the amount\r\nof evaporation. It does, however, influence the rate of evaporation,\r\nwhich is retarded by the presence of air. The main things influencing\r\nevaporation are, first, the quantity of heat supplied and, second, the\r\nrelative humidity of the immediately surrounding space.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Drying by Superheated Steam\r\n\r\nWhat this term really signifies is simply water vapor in the absence\r\nof air in a condition of less than saturation. Kilns of this type are,\r\nproperly speaking, vapor kilns, and usually operate at atmospheric\r\npressure, but may be used at greater pressures or at less pressures.\r\nAs stated before, the vapor present in the air at any humidity less\r\nthan saturation is really \"superheated steam,\" only at a lower\r\npressure than is ordinarily understood by this term, and mixed with\r\nair. The main argument in favor of this process seems to be based on\r\nthe idea that steam is moist heat. This is true, however, only when\r\nthe steam is near saturation. When it is superheated it is just as dry\r\nas air containing the same relative humidity. For instance, steam at\r\natmospheric pressure and heated to 248 degrees Fahrenheit has a\r\nrelative humidity of only 50 per cent and is just as dry as air\r\ncontaining the same humidity. If heated to 306 degrees Fahrenheit, its\r\nrelative humidity is reduced to 20 per cent; that is to say, the ratio\r\nof its actual vapor pressure (one atmosphere) to the pressure of\r\nsaturated vapor at this temperature (five atmospheres) is 1:5, or 20\r\nper cent. Superheated vapor in the absence of air, however, parts with\r\nits heat with great rapidity and finally becomes saturated when it has\r\nlost all of its ability to cause evaporation. In this respect it is\r\nmore moist than air when it comes in contact with bodies which are at\r\na lower temperature. When saturated steam is used to heat the lumber\r\nit can raise the temperature of the latter to its own temperature, but\r\ncannot produce evaporation unless, indeed, the pressure is varied.\r\nOnly by the heat supplied above the temperature of saturation can\r\nevaporation be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Impregnation Methods\r\n\r\nMethods of partially overcoming the shrinkage by impregnation of the\r\ncell walls with organic materials closely allied to the wood substance\r\nitself are in use. In one of these which has been patented, sugar is\r\nused as the impregnating material, which is subsequently hardened or\r\n\"caramelized\" by heating. Experiments which the United States Forest\r\nService has made substantiate the claims that the sugar does greatly\r\nreduce the shrinkage of the wood; but the use of impregnation\r\nprocesses is determined rather from a financial economic standpoint\r\nthan by the physical result obtained.\r\n\r\nAnother process consists in passing a current of electricity through\r\nthe wet boards or through the green logs before sawing. It is said\r\nthat the ligno cellulose and the sap are thus transformed by\r\nelectrolysis, and that the wood subsequently dries more rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Preliminary Treatments\r\n\r\nIn many dry kiln operations, especially where the kilns are not\r\ndesigned for treatments with very moist air, the wood is allowed to\r\nair-season from several months to a year or more before running it\r\ninto the dry kiln. In this way the surface dries below its\r\nfibre-saturation point and becomes hardened or \"set\" and the\r\nsubsequent shrinkage is not so great. Moreover, there is less danger\r\nof surface checking in the kiln, since the surface has already passed\r\nthe danger point. Many woods, however, check severely in air-drying or\r\ncase-harden in the air. It is thought that such woods can be\r\nsatisfactorily handled in a humidity-regulated kiln direct from the\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\nPreliminary steaming is frequently used to moisten the surface if\r\ncase-hardened, and to heat the lumber through to the center before\r\ndrying begins. This is sometimes done in a separate chamber, but more\r\noften in a compartment of the kiln itself, partitioned off by means of\r\na curtain which can be raised or lowered as circumstances require.\r\nThis steaming is usually conducted at atmospheric pressure and\r\nfrequently condensed steam is used at temperatures far below 212\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit. In a humidity-regulated kiln this preliminary\r\ntreatment may be omitted, since nearly saturated conditions can be\r\nmaintained and graduated as the drying progresses.\r\n\r\nRecently the process of steaming at pressures up to 20 pounds gauge in\r\na cylinder for short periods of time, varying from 5 to 20 minutes, is\r\nbeing advocated in the United States. The truck load is run into the\r\ncylinder, steamed, and then taken directly out into the air. It may\r\nsubsequently be placed in the dry kiln if further drying is desired.\r\nThe self-contained heat of the wood evaporates considerable moisture,\r\nand the sudden drying of the boards causes the shrinkage to be reduced\r\nslightly in some cases. Such short periods of steaming under 20 pounds\r\npressure do not appear to injure the wood mechanically, although they\r\ndo darken the color appreciably, especially of the sapwood of the\r\nspecies having a light-colored sap, as black walnut (_Juglans nigra_)\r\nand red gum (_Liquidamber styraciflua_). Longer periods of steaming\r\nhave been found to weaken the wood. There is a great difference in the\r\neffect on different species, however.\r\n\r\nSoaking wood for a long time before drying has been practised, but\r\nexperiments indicate that no particularly beneficial results, from the\r\ndrying standpoint, are attained thereby. In fact, in some species\r\ncontaining sugars and allied substances it is probably detrimental\r\nfrom the shrinkage standpoint. If soaked in boiling water some species\r\nshrink and warp more than if dried without this treatment.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that, except possibly for short-period\r\nsteaming as described above, steaming and soaking hardwoods at\r\ntemperatures of 212 degrees Fahrenheit or over should be avoided if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIt is the old saying that wood put into water shortly after it is\r\nfelled, and left in water for a year or more, will be perfectly\r\nseasoned after a short subsequent exposure to the air. For this reason\r\nrivermen maintain that timber is made better by rafting. Herzenstein\r\nsays: \"Floating the timber down rivers helps to wash out the sap, and\r\nhence must be considered as favorable to its preservation, the more so\r\nas it enables it to absorb more preservative.\"\r\n\r\nWood which has been buried in swamps is eagerly sought after by\r\ncarpenters and joiners, because it has lost all tendency to warp and\r\ntwist. When first taken from the swamp the long-immersed logs are very\r\nmuch heavier than water, but they dry with great rapidity. A cypress\r\nlog from the Mississippi Delta, which two men could barely handle at\r\nthe time it was taken out some years ago, has dried out so much since\r\nthen that to-day one man can lift it with ease. White cedar telegraph\r\npoles are said to remain floating in the water of the Great Lakes\r\nsometimes for several years before they are set in lines and to last\r\nbetter than freshly cut poles.\r\n\r\nIt is very probable that immersion for long periods in water does\r\nmaterially hasten subsequent seasoning. The tannins, resins,\r\nalbuminous materials, etc., which are deposited in the cell walls of\r\nthe fibres of green wood, and which prevent rapid evaporation of the\r\nwater, undergo changes when under water, probably due to the action of\r\nbacteria which live without air, and in the course of time many of\r\nthese substances are leached out of the wood. The cells thereby become\r\nmore and more permeable to water, and when the wood is finally brought\r\ninto the air the water escapes very rapidly and very evenly.\r\nHerzenstein's statement that wood prepared by immersion and subsequent\r\ndrying will absorb more preservative, and that with greater rapidity,\r\nis certainly borne out by experience in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes claimed that all seasoning preparatory to treatment\r\nwith a substance like tar oil might be done away with by putting the\r\ngreen wood into a cylinder with the oil and heating to 225 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, thus driving the water off in the form of steam, after\r\nwhich the tar oil would readily penetrate into the wood. This is the\r\nbasis of the so-called \"Curtiss process\" of timber treatment. Without\r\ngoing into any discussion of this method of creosoting, it may be said\r\nthat the same objection made for steaming holds here. In order to get\r\na temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit in the center of the treated\r\nwood, the outside temperature would have to be raised so high that the\r\nstrength of the wood might be seriously injured.\r\n\r\nA company on the Pacific coast which treats red fir piling asserts\r\nthat it avoids this danger by leaving the green timber in the tar oil\r\nat a temperature which never exceeds 225 degrees Fahrenheit for from\r\nfive to twelve hours, until there is no further evidence of water\r\nvapor coming out of the wood. The tar oil is then run out, and a\r\nvacuum is created for about an hour, after which the oil is run in\r\nagain and is kept in the cylinders under 100 pounds pressure for from\r\nten to twelve hours, until the required amount of absorption has been\r\nreached (about 12 pounds per cubic foot).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Out-of-door Seasoning\r\n\r\nThe most effective seasoning is without doubt that obtained by the\r\nuniform, slow drying which takes place in properly constructed piles\r\noutdoors, under exposure to the winds and the sun. Lumber has always\r\nbeen seasoned in this way, which is still the best for ordinary\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIt is probable for the sake of economy, air-drying will be eliminated\r\nin the drying process of the future without loss to the quality of the\r\nproduct, but as yet no effective method has been discovered whereby\r\nthis may be accomplished, because nature performs certain functions in\r\nair-drying that cannot be duplicated by artificial means. Because of\r\nthis, hardwoods, as a rule, cannot be successfully kiln-dried green or\r\ndirect from the saw, and must receive a certain amount of preliminary\r\nair-drying before being placed in a dry kiln.\r\n\r\nThe present methods of air-seasoning in use have been determined by\r\nlong experience, and are probably as good as they could be made for\r\npresent conditions. But the same care has not up to this time been\r\ngiven to the seasoning of such timber as ties, bridge material, posts,\r\ntelegraph and telephone poles, etc. These have sometimes been piled\r\nmore or less intelligently, but in the majority of cases their value\r\nhas been too low to make it seem worth while to pile with reference to\r\nanything beyond convenience in handling.\r\n\r\nIn piling material for air-seasoning, one should utilize high, dry\r\nground when possible, and see that the foundations are high enough off\r\nthe ground, so that there is proper air circulation through the bottom\r\nof the piles, and also that the piles are far enough apart so that the\r\nair may circulate freely through and around them.\r\n\r\nIt is air circulation that is desired in all cases of drying, both in\r\ndry kilns and out-of-doors, and not sunshine; that is, not the sun\r\nshining directly upon the material. The ends also should be protected\r\nfrom the sun, and everything possible done to induce a free\r\ncirculation of air, and to keep the foundations free from all plant\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the heavier the material to be dried, the more difficulty\r\nis experienced from checking, which has its most active time in the\r\nspring when the sap is rising. In fact the main period of danger in\r\nmaterial checking comes with the March winds and the April showers,\r\nand not infrequently in the South it occurs earlier than that. In\r\nother words, as soon as the sap begins to rise, the timber shows signs\r\nof checking, and that is the time to take extra precautions by careful\r\npiling and protection from the sun. When the hot days of summer arrive\r\nthe tendency to check is not so bad, but stock will sour from the\r\nheat, stain from the sap, mildew from moisture, and fall a prey to\r\nwood-destroying insects.\r\n\r\nIt has been proven in a general way that wood will season more slowly\r\nin winter than in summer, and also that the water content during\r\nvarious months varies. In the spring the drying-out of wood cut in\r\nOctober and November will take place more rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XI\r\n\r\n                          KILN-DRYING OF WOOD\r\n\r\n\r\n               Advantages of Kiln-drying over Air-drying\r\n\r\nSome of the advantages of kiln-drying to be secured over air-drying in\r\naddition to reducing the shipping weight and lessening quantity of\r\nstock are the following:\r\n\r\n     1. Less material lost.\r\n     2. Better quality of product.\r\n     3. Prevention of sap stain and mould.\r\n     4. Fixation of gums and resins.\r\n     5. Reduction of hygroscopicity.\r\n\r\nThis reduction in the tendency to take up moisture means a reduction\r\nin the \"working\" of the material which, even though slight, is of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe problem of drying wood in the best manner divides itself into two\r\ndistinct parts, one of which is entirely concerned with the behavior\r\nof the wood itself and the physical phenomena involved, while the\r\nother part has to do with the control of the drying process.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Physical Conditions governing the Drying of Wood\r\n\r\n     1. Wood is soft and plastic while hot and moist, and becomes\r\n     \"set\" in whatever shape it dries. Some species are much more\r\n     plastic than others.\r\n\r\n     2. Wood substance begins to shrink only when it dries below\r\n     the fibre-saturation point, at which it contains from 25 to\r\n     30 per cent moisture based on its dry weight. Eucalyptus and\r\n     certain other species appear to be exceptions to this law.\r\n\r\n     3. The shrinkage of wood is about twice as great\r\n     circumferentially as in the radial direction; lengthwise, it\r\n     is very slight.\r\n\r\n     4. Wood shrinks most when subjected, while kept moist, to\r\n     slow drying at high temperatures.\r\n\r\n     5. Rapid drying produces less shrinkage than slow drying at\r\n     high temperatures, but is apt to cause case-hardening and\r\n     honeycombing, especially in dense woods.\r\n\r\n     6. Case-hardening, honeycombing, and cupping result directly\r\n     from conditions 1, 4, and 5, and chemical changes of the\r\n     outer surface.\r\n\r\n     7. Brittleness is caused by carrying the drying process too\r\n     far, or by using too high temperatures. Safe limits of\r\n     treatment vary greatly for different species.\r\n\r\n     8. Wood absorbs or loses moisture in proportion to the\r\n     relative humidity in the air, not according to the\r\n     temperature. This property is called its \"hygroscopicity.\"\r\n\r\n     9. Hygroscopicity and \"working\" are reduced but not\r\n     eliminated by thorough drying.\r\n\r\n     10. Moisture tends to transfuse from the hot towards the\r\n     cold portion of the wood.\r\n\r\n     11. Collapse of the cells may occur in some species while\r\n     the wood is hot and plastic. This collapse is independent of\r\n     subsequent shrinkage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Theory of Kiln-drying\r\n\r\nThe dry kiln has long since acquired particular appreciation at the\r\nhands of those who have witnessed its time-saving qualities, when\r\npractically applied to the drying of timber. The science of drying is\r\nitself of the simplest, the exposure to the air being, indeed, the\r\nonly means needed where the matter of time is not called into\r\nquestion. Otherwise, where hours, even minutes, have a marked\r\nsignificance, then other means must be introduced to bring about the\r\ndesired effect. In any event, however, the same simple and natural\r\nremedy pertains,--the absorption of moisture. This moisture in green\r\ntimber is known as \"sap\", which is itself composed of a number of\r\ningredients, most important among which are water, resin, and albumen.\r\n\r\nAll dry kilns in existence use heat to season timber; that is, to\r\ndrive out that portion of the \"sap\" which is volatile.\r\n\r\nThe heat does not drive out the resin of the pines nor the albumen of\r\nthe hardwoods. It is really of no advantage in this respect. Resin in\r\nits hardened state as produced by heat is only slowly soluble in water\r\nand contains a large proportion of carbon, the most stable form of\r\nmatter. Therefore, its retention in the pores of the wood is a\r\npositive advantage.\r\n\r\nTo produce the ideal effect the drying must commence at the heart of\r\nthe piece and work outward, the moisture being removed from the\r\nsurface as fast as it exudes from the pores of the wood. To\r\nsuccessfully accomplish this, adjustments must be available to\r\nregulate the temperature, circulation, and humidity according to the\r\nvariations of the atmospheric conditions, the kind and condition of\r\nthe material to be dried.\r\n\r\nThis ideal effect is only attained by the use of a type of dry kiln in\r\nwhich the surface of the lumber is kept soft, the pores being left\r\nopen until all the moisture within has been volatilized by the heat\r\nand carried off by a free circulation of air. When the moisture has\r\nbeen removed from the pores, the surface is dried without closing the\r\npores, resulting in timber that is clean, soft, bright, straight, and\r\nabsolutely free from stains, checks, or other imperfections.\r\n\r\nNow, no matter how the method of drying may be applied, it must be\r\nremembered that vapor exists in the atmosphere at all times, its\r\nvolume being regulated by the capacity of the temperature absorbed. To\r\nkiln-dry properly, a free current of air must be maintained, of\r\nsufficient volume to carry off this moisture. Now, the capacity of\r\nthis air for drying depends entirely upon the ability of its\r\ntemperature to absorb or carry off a larger proportion of moisture\r\nthan that apportioned by natural means. Thus, it will be seen, a cubic\r\nfoot of air at 32 degrees Fahrenheit is capable of absorbing only two\r\ngrains of water, while at 160 degrees, it will dispose of ninety\r\ngrains. The air, therefore, should be made as dry as possible and\r\ncaused to move freely, so as to remove all moisture from the surface\r\nof the wood as soon as it appears. Thus the heat effects a double\r\npurpose, not only increasing the rate of evaporation, but also the\r\ncapacity of the air for absorption. Where these means are applied,\r\nwhich rely on the heat alone to accomplish this purpose, only that of\r\nthe moisture which is volatile succumbs, while the albumen and resin\r\nbecoming hardened under the treatment close up the pores of the wood.\r\nThis latter result is oft-times accomplished while moisture yet\r\nremains and which in an enforced effort to escape bursts open the\r\ncells in which it has been confined and creates what is known as\r\n\"checks.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, taking the above facts into consideration, the essentials\r\nfor the successful kiln-drying of wood may be enumerated as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. The evaporation from the surface of a stick should not\r\n     exceed the rate at which the moisture transfuses from the\r\n     interior to the surface.\r\n\r\n     2. Drying should proceed uniformly at all points, otherwise\r\n     extra stresses are set up in the wood, causing warping, etc.\r\n\r\n     3. Heat should penetrate to the interior of the piece before\r\n     drying begins.\r\n\r\n     4. The humidity should be suited to the condition of the\r\n     wood at the start and reduced in the proper ratio as drying\r\n     progresses. With wet or green wood it should usually be held\r\n     uniform at a degree which will prevent the surface from\r\n     drying below its saturation point until all the free water\r\n     has evaporated, then gradually reduced to remove the\r\n     hygroscopic moisture.\r\n\r\n     5. The temperature should be uniform and as high as the\r\n     species under treatment will stand without excessive\r\n     shrinkage, collapse, or checking.\r\n\r\n     6. Rate of drying should be controlled by the amount of\r\n     humidity in the air and not by the rate of circulation,\r\n     which should be made ample at all times.\r\n\r\n     7. In drying refractory hardwoods, such as oak, best results\r\n     are obtained at a comparatively low temperature. In more\r\n     easily dried hardwoods, such as maple, and some of the more\r\n     difficult softwoods, as cypress, the process may be hastened\r\n     by a higher temperature but not above the boiling point. In\r\n     many of the softwoods, the rate of drying may be very\r\n     greatly increased by heating above the boiling point with a\r\n     large circulation of vapor at atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\n     8. Unequal shrinkage between the exterior and interior\r\n     portions of the wood and also unequal chemical changes must\r\n     be guarded against by temperatures and humidities suited to\r\n     the species in question to prevent subsequent cupping and\r\n     warping.\r\n\r\n     9. The degree of dryness attained should conform to the use\r\n     to which the wood is put.\r\n\r\n     10. Proper piling of the material and weighting to prevent\r\n     warping are of great importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                Requirements in a Satisfactory Dry Kiln\r\n\r\nThe requirements in a satisfactory dry kiln are:\r\n\r\n     1. Control of humidity at all times.\r\n     2. Ample air circulation at all points.\r\n     3. Uniform and proper temperatures.\r\n\r\nIn order to meet these requirements the United States Forestry Service\r\nhas designed a kiln in which the humidity, temperature, and\r\ncirculation can be controlled at all times.\r\n\r\nBriefly, it consists of a drying chamber with a partition on either\r\nside, making two narrow side chambers open top and bottom.\r\n\r\nThe steam pipes are in the usual position underneath the material to\r\nbe dried.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the side chambers is a spray; at the bottom are gutters\r\nand an eliminator or set of baffle plates to separate the fine mist\r\nfrom the air.\r\n\r\nThe spray accomplishes two things: It induces an increased circulation\r\nand it regulates the humidity. This is done by regulating the\r\ntemperature of the spray water.\r\n\r\nThe air under the heating coil is saturated at whatever temperature\r\nis required. This temperature is the dew point of the air after it\r\npasses up into the drying chamber above the coils. Knowing the\r\ntemperature in the drying room and the dew point, the relative\r\nhumidity is thus determined.\r\n\r\nThe relative humidity is simply the ratio of the vapor pressure at the\r\ndew point to the pressure of saturated vapor (see Fig. 30).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 30. Section through United States\r\n    Forestry Service Humidity-controlled Dry Kiln.]\r\n\r\n\r\n          Theory and Description of the Forestry Service Kiln\r\n\r\nThe humidities and temperatures in the piles of lumber are largely\r\ndependent upon the circulation of air within the kiln. The temperature\r\nand humidity within the kiln, taken alone, are no criterion of the\r\nconditions of drying the pile of lumber if the circulation in any\r\nportion is deficient. It is possible to have an extremely rapid\r\ncirculation of air within the dry kiln itself and yet have stagnation\r\nwithin the individual piles, the air passing chiefly through open\r\nspaces and channels. Wherever stagnation exists or the movement of air\r\nis too sluggish the temperature will drop and the humidity increase,\r\nperhaps to the point of saturation.\r\n\r\nWhen in large kilns the forced circulation is in the opposite\r\ndirection from that induced by the cooling of the air by the lumber,\r\nthere is always more or less uncertainty as to the movement of the air\r\nthrough the piles. Even with the boards placed edge-wise, with\r\nstickers running vertically, and with the heating pipes beneath the\r\nlumber, it was found that although the air passed upward through most\r\nof the spaces it was actually descending through others, so that very\r\nunequal drying resulted. While edge piling would at first thought seem\r\nideal for the freest circulation in an ordinary kiln with steam pipes\r\nbelow, it in fact produces an indeterminate condition; air columns may\r\npass downward through some channels as well as upward through others,\r\nand probably stagnate in still others. Nevertheless, edge piling is\r\ngreatly superior to flat piling where the heating system is below the\r\nlumber.\r\n\r\nFrom experiments and from study of conditions in commercial kilns the\r\nidea was developed of so arranging the parts of the kiln and the pile\r\nof lumber that advantage might be taken of this cooling of the air to\r\nassist the circulation. That this can be readily accomplished without\r\ndoing away with the present features of regulation of humidity by\r\nmeans of a spray of water is clear from Fig. 30, which shows a\r\ncross-section of the improved humidity-regulated dry kiln.\r\n\r\nIn the form shown in the sketch a chamber or flue B runs through the\r\ncenter near the bottom. This flue is only about 6 or 7 feet in height\r\nand, together with the water spray F and the baffle plates DD,\r\nconstitutes the humidity-control feature of the kiln. This control of\r\nhumidity is affected by the temperature of the water used in the\r\nspray. This spray completely saturates the air in the flue B at\r\nwhatever predetermined temperature is required. The baffle plates DD\r\nare to separate all entrained particles of water from the air, so that\r\nit is delivered to the heaters in a saturated condition at the\r\nrequired temperature. This temperature is, therefore, the dew point of\r\nthe air when heated above, and the method of humidity control may\r\ntherefore be called the dew-point method. It is a very simple matter\r\nby means of the humidity diagram (see Fig. 93), or by a hygrodeik\r\n(Fig. 94), to determine what dew-point temperature is needed for any\r\ndesired humidity above the heaters.\r\n\r\nBesides regulating the humidity the spray F also acts as an ejector\r\nand forces circulation of air through the flue B. The heating system H\r\nis concentrated near the outer walls, so as to heat the rising column\r\nof air. The temperature within the drying chamber is controlled by\r\nmeans of any suitable thermostat, actuating a valve on the main steam\r\nline. The lumber is piled in such a way that the stickers slope\r\ndownward toward the sides of the kiln.\r\n\r\nM is an auxiliary steam spray pointing downward for use at very high\r\ntemperatures. C is a gutter to catch the precipitation and conduct it\r\nback to the pump, the water being recirculated through the sprays. G\r\nis a pipe condenser for use toward the end of the drying operation. K\r\nis a baffle plate for diverting the heated air and at the same time\r\nshielding the under layers of boards from direct radiation of the\r\nsteam pipes.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the kiln is simple. The heated air rises above the\r\npipes HH and between the piles of lumber. As it comes in contact with\r\nthe piles, portions of it are cooled and pass downward and outward\r\nthrough the layers of boards into the space between the condensers GG.\r\nHere the column of cooled air descends into the spray flue B, where\r\nits velocity is increased by the force of the water spray. It then\r\npasses out from the baffle plates to the heaters and repeats the\r\ncycle.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest advantages of this natural circulation method is\r\nthat the colder the lumber when placed in the kiln the greater is the\r\nmovement produced, under the very conditions which call for the\r\ngreatest circulation--just the opposite of the direct-circulation\r\nmethod. This is a feature of the greatest importance in winter, when\r\nthe lumber is put into the kiln in a frozen condition. One truckload\r\nof lumber at 60 per cent moisture may easily contain over 7,000 pounds\r\nof ice.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of circulation the kiln is, in fact, seldom\r\nregulatory--the colder the lumber the greater the circulation\r\nproduced, with the effect increased toward the cooler and wetter\r\nportions of the pile.\r\n\r\nPreliminary steaming may be used in connection with this kiln, but\r\nexperiments indicate that ordinarily it is not desirable, since the\r\nhigh humidity which can be secured gives as good results, and being at\r\nas low a temperature as desired, much better results in the case of\r\ncertain difficult woods like oak, eucalyptus, etc., are obtained.\r\n\r\nThis kiln has another advantage in that its operation is entirely\r\nindependent of outdoor atmospheric conditions, except that barometric\r\npressure will effect it slightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              KILN-DRYING\r\n\r\n                                Remarks\r\n\r\nDrying is an essential part of the preparation of wood for\r\nmanufacture. For a long time the only drying process used or known was\r\nair-drying, or the exposure of wood to the gradual drying influences\r\nof the open air, and is what has now been termed \"preliminary\r\nseasoning.\" This method is without doubt the most successful and\r\neffective seasoning, because nature performs certain functions in\r\nair-drying that cannot be duplicated by artificial means. Because of\r\nthis, hardwoods, as a rule, cannot be successfully kiln-dried green or\r\ndirect from the saw.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years, considerable interest is awakening among wood\r\nusers in the operation of kiln-drying. The losses occasioned in\r\nair-drying and in improper kiln-drying, and the necessity for getting\r\nmaterial dry as quickly as possible from the saw, for shipping\r\npurposes and also for manufacturing, are bringing about a realization\r\nof the importance of a technical knowledge of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe losses which occur in air-drying wood, through checking, warping,\r\nstaining, and rotting, are often greater than one would suppose. While\r\ncorrect statistics of this nature are difficult to obtain, some idea\r\nmay be had of the amount of degrading of the better class of lumber.\r\nIn the case of one species of soft wood, Western larch, it is commonly\r\nadmitted that the best grades fall off sixty to seventy per cent in\r\nair-drying, and it is probable that the same is true in the case of\r\nSouthern swamp oaks. In Western yellow pine, the loss is great, and in\r\nthe Southern red gum, it is probably as much as thirty per cent. It\r\nmay be said that in all species there is some loss in air-drying, but\r\nin some easily dried species such as spruce, hemlock, maple, etc., it\r\nis not so great.\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be correct to state at the present time that this loss\r\ncould be entirely prevented by proper methods of kiln-drying the green\r\nlumber, but it is safe to say that it can be greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nIt is well where stock is kiln-dried direct from the saw or knife,\r\nafter having first been steamed or boiled--as in the case of veneers,\r\netc.,--to get them into the kiln while they are still warm, as they\r\nare then in good condition for kiln-drying, as the fibres of the wood\r\nare soft and the pores well opened, which will allow of forcing the\r\nevaporation of moisture without much damage being done to the\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nWith softwoods it is a common practice to kiln-dry direct from the\r\nsaw. This procedure, however, is ill adapted for the hardwoods, in\r\nwhich it would produce such warping and checking as would greatly\r\nreduce the value of the product. Therefore, hardwoods, as a rule, are\r\nmore or less thoroughly air-dried before being placed in the dry kiln,\r\nwhere the residue of moisture may be reduced to within three or four\r\nper cent, which is much lower than is possible by air-drying only.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that for the sake of economy, air-drying will be\r\neliminated in the drying processes of the future without loss to the\r\nquality of the product, but as yet no method has been discovered\r\nwhereby this may be accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe dry kiln has been, and probably still is, one of the most\r\ntroublesome factors arising from the development of the timber\r\nindustry. In the earlier days, before power machinery for the\r\nworking-up of timber products came into general use, dry kilns were\r\nunheard-of, air-drying or seasoning was then relied upon solely to\r\nfurnish the craftsman with dry stock from which to manufacture his\r\nproduct. Even after machinery had made rapid and startling strides on\r\nits way to perfection, the dry kiln remained practically an unknown\r\nquantity, but gradually, as the industry developed and demand for dry\r\nmaterial increased, the necessity for some more rapid and positive\r\nmethod of seasoning became apparent, and the subject of artificial\r\ndrying began to receive the serious attention of the more progressive\r\nand energetic members of the craft.\r\n\r\nKiln-drying which is an artificial method, originated in the effort to\r\nimprove or shorten the process, by subjecting the wood to a high\r\ntemperature or to a draught of heated air in a confined space or kiln.\r\nIn so doing, time is saved and a certain degree of control over the\r\ndrying operation is secured.\r\n\r\nThe first efforts in the way of artificial drying were confined to\r\naiding or hastening nature in the seasoning process by exposing the\r\nmaterial to the direct heat from fires built in pits, over which the\r\nlumber was piled in a way to expose it to the heat rays of the fires\r\nbelow. This, of course, was a primitive, hazardous, and very\r\nunsatisfactory method, to say the least, but it marked the first step\r\nin the evolution of the present-day dry kiln, and in that particular\r\nonly is it deserving of mention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Underlying Principles\r\n\r\nIn addition to marking the first step in artificial drying, it\r\nillustrated also, in the simplest manner possible, the three\r\nunderlying principles governing all drying problems: (1) The\r\napplication of heat to evaporate or volatilize the water contained in\r\nthe material; (2) with sufficient air in circulation to carry away in\r\nsuspension the vapor thus liberated; and (3) with a certain amount of\r\nhumidity present to prevent the surface from drying too rapidly while\r\nthe heat is allowed to penetrate to the interior. The last performs\r\ntwo distinct functions: (a) It makes the wood more permeable to the\r\npassage of the moisture from the interior of the wood to the surface,\r\nand (b) it supplies the latent heat necessary to evaporate the\r\nmoisture after it reaches the surface. The air circulation is\r\nimportant in removing the moisture after it has been evaporated by the\r\nheat, and ventilation also serves the purpose of bringing the heat in\r\ncontact with the wood. If, however, plain, dry heat is applied to the\r\nwood, the surface will become entirely dry before the interior\r\nmoisture is even heated, let alone removed. This condition causes\r\n\"case-hardening\" or \"hollow-horning.\" So it is very essential that\r\nsufficient humidity be maintained to prevent the surface from drying\r\ntoo rapidly, while the heat is allowed to penetrate to the interior.\r\n\r\nThis humidity or moisture is originated by the evaporation from the\r\ndrying wood, or by the admission of steam into the dry kiln by the use\r\nof steam spray pipes, and is absolutely necessary in the process of\r\nhastening the drying of wood. With green lumber it keeps the sap near\r\nthe surface of the piece in a condition that allows the escape of the\r\nmoisture from its interior; or, in other words, it prevents the\r\noutside from drying first, which would close the pores and cause\r\ncase-hardening.\r\n\r\nThe great amount of latent heat necessary to evaporate the water after\r\nit has reached the surface is shown by the fact that the evaporation\r\nof only one pound of water will extract approximately 66 degrees from\r\n1,000 cubic feet of air, allowing the air to drop in temperature from\r\n154 to 84 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition to this amount of heat, the\r\nwood and the water must also be raised to the temperature at which the\r\ndrying is to be accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt matters not what type of dry kiln is used, source or application of\r\nheating medium, these underlying principles remain the same, and must\r\nbe the first things considered in the design or selection of the\r\nequipment necessary for producing the three essentials of drying:\r\nHeat, humidity, and circulation.\r\n\r\nAlthough these principles constitute the basis of all drying problems\r\nand must, therefore, be continually carried in mind in the\r\nconsideration of them, it is equally necessary to have a comprehensive\r\nunderstanding of the characteristics of the materials to be dried, and\r\nits action during the drying process. All failures in the past, in the\r\ndrying of timber products, can be directly attributed to either the\r\nkiln designer's neglect of these things, or his failure to carry them\r\nfully in mind in the consideration of his problems.\r\n\r\nWood has characteristics very much different from those of other\r\nmaterials, and what little knowledge we have of it and its properties\r\nhas been taken from the accumulated records of experience. The reason\r\nfor this imperfect knowledge lies in the fact that wood is not a\r\nhomogeneous material like the metals, but a complicated structure, and\r\nso variable that one stick will behave in a manner widely different\r\nfrom that of another, although it may have been cut from the same\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nThe great variety of woods often makes the mere distinction of the\r\nkind or species of the tree most difficult. It is not uncommon to find\r\nmen of long experience disagree as to the kind of tree a certain piece\r\nof lumber was cut from, and, in some cases, there is even a wide\r\ndifference in the appearance and evidently the structure of timber cut\r\nfrom the same tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Objects of Kiln-drying\r\n\r\nThe objects of kiln-drying wood may be placed under three main\r\nheadings: (1) To reduce shipping expenses; (2) to reduce the quantity\r\nnecessary to maintain in stock; and (3) to reduce losses in air-drying\r\nand to properly prepare the wood for subsequent use. Item number 2\r\nnaturally follows as a consequence of either 1 or 3. The reduction in\r\nweight on account of shipping expenses is of greatest significance\r\nwith the Northwestern lumbermen in the case of Douglas fir, redwood,\r\nWestern red cedar, sugar pine, bull pine, and other softwoods.\r\n\r\nVery rapid methods of rough drying are possible with some of these\r\nspecies, and are in use. High temperatures are used, and the water is\r\nsometimes boiled off from the wood by heating above 212 degrees\r\nFahrenheit. These high-temperature methods will not apply to the\r\nmajority of hardwoods, however, nor to many of the softwoods.\r\n\r\nIt must first of all be recognized that the drying of lumber is a\r\ntotally different operation from the drying of a fabric or of thin\r\nmaterial. In the latter, it is largely a matter of evaporated\r\nmoisture, but wood is not only hygroscopic and attracts moisture from\r\nthe air, but its physical behavior is very complex and renders the\r\nextraction of moisture a very complicated process.\r\n\r\nAn idea of its complexity may be had by mentioning some of the\r\nconditions which must be contended with. Shrinkage is, perhaps, the\r\nmost important. This is unequal in different directions, being twice\r\nas great tangentially as radially and fifty times as great radially as\r\nlongitudinally. Moreover, shrinkage is often unequal in different\r\nportions of the same piece. The slowness of the transfusion of\r\nmoisture through the wood is an important factor. This varies with\r\ndifferent woods and greatly in different directions. Wood becomes soft\r\nand plastic when hot and moist, and will yield more or less to\r\ninternal stresses. As some species are practically impervious to air\r\nwhen wet, this plasticity of the cell walls causes them to collapse as\r\nthe water passes outward from the cell cavities. This difficulty has\r\ngiven much trouble in the case of Western red cedar, and also to some\r\nextent in redwood. The unequal shrinkage causes internal stresses in\r\nthe wood as it dries, which results in warping, checking,\r\ncase-hardening, and honeycombing. Case-hardening is one of the most\r\ncommon defects in improperly dried lumber. It is clearly shown by the\r\ncupping of the two halves when a case-hardened board is resawed.\r\nChemical changes also occur in the wood in drying, especially so at\r\nhigher temperatures, rendering it less hygroscopic, but more brittle.\r\nIf dried too much or at too high a temperature, the strength and\r\ntoughness is seriously reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Conditions of Success\r\n\r\nCommercial success in drying therefore requires that the substance be\r\nexposed to the air in the most efficient manner; that the temperature\r\nof the air be as high as the substance will stand without injury, and\r\nthat the air change or movement be as rapid as is consistent with\r\neconomical installation and operation. Conditions of success therefore\r\nrequire the observance of the following points, which embody the basic\r\nprinciples of the process: (1) The timber should be heated through\r\nbefore drying begins. (2) The air should be very humid at the\r\nbeginning of the drying process, and be made drier only gradually. (3)\r\nThe temperature of the lumber must be maintained uniformly throughout\r\nthe entire pile. (4) Control of the drying process at any given\r\ntemperature must be secured by controlling the relative humidity, not\r\nby decreasing the circulation. (5) In general, high temperatures\r\npermit more rapid drying than do lower temperatures. The higher the\r\ntemperature of the lumber, the more efficient is the kiln. It is\r\nbelieved that temperatures as high as the boiling point are not\r\ninjurious to most woods, providing all other fundamentally important\r\nfeatures are taken care of. Some species, however, are not able to\r\nstand as high temperatures as others, and (6) the degree of dryness\r\nattained, where strength is the prime requisite, should not exceed\r\nthat at which the wood is to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Different Treatment according to Kind\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which water may be evaporated, that is, the rate of\r\ndrying, depends on the size and shape of the piece and on the\r\nstructure of the wood. Thin stock can be dried much faster than thick,\r\nunder the same conditions of temperature, circulation, and humidity.\r\nPine can be dried, as a general thing, in about one third of the time\r\nthat would be required for oak of the same thickness, although the\r\nformer contains the more water of the two. Quarter-sawn oak usually\r\nrequires half again as long as plain oak. Mahogany requires about the\r\nsame time as plain oak; ash dries in a little less time, and maple,\r\naccording to the purpose for which it is intended, may be dried in one\r\nfifth the time needed for oak, or may require a slightly longer\r\ntreatment. For birch, the time required is from one half to two\r\nthirds, and for poplar and basswood, from, one fifth to one third that\r\nrequired for oak.\r\n\r\nAll kinds and thicknesses of lumber cannot be dried at the same time\r\nin the same kiln. It is manifest that green and air-dried lumber,\r\ndense and porous lumber, all require different treatment. For\r\ninstance, Southern yellow pine when cut green from the log will stand\r\na very high temperature, say 200 degrees Fahrenheit, and in fact this\r\nhigh temperature is necessary together with a rapid circulation of air\r\nin order to neutralize the acidity of the pitch which causes the wood\r\nto blue and discolor. This lumber requires to be heated up immediately\r\nand to be kept hot throughout the length of the kiln. Hence the kiln\r\nmust not be of such length as to allow of the air being too much\r\ncooled before escaping.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Temperature depends\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that a higher temperature can be carried in the kiln\r\nfor drying pine and similar woods, this does not altogether account\r\nfor the great difference in drying time, as experience has taught us\r\nthat even when both woods are dried in the same kiln, under the same\r\nconditions, pine will still dry much faster, proving thereby that the\r\nstructure of the wood itself affects drying.\r\n\r\nThe aim of all kiln designers should be to dry in the shortest\r\npossible time, without injury to the material. Experience has\r\ndemonstrated that high temperatures are very effective in evaporating\r\nwater, regardless of the degree of humidity, but great care must be\r\nexercised in using extreme temperatures that the material to be dried\r\nis not damaged by checking, case-hardening, or hollow-horning.\r\n\r\nThe temperature used should depend upon the species and condition of\r\nthe material when entering the kiln. In general, it is advantageous to\r\nhave as high a temperature as possible, both for economy of operation\r\nand speed of drying, but the physical properties of the wood will\r\ngovern this.\r\n\r\nMany species cannot be dried satisfactorily at high temperatures on\r\naccount of their peculiar behavior. This is particularly so with green\r\nlumber.\r\n\r\nAir-dried wood will stand a relatively higher temperature, as a rule,\r\nthan wet or green wood. In drying green wood direct from the saw, it\r\nis usually best to start with a comparatively low temperature, and not\r\nraise the temperature until the wood is nearly dry. For example, green\r\nmaple containing about 60 per cent of its dry weight in water should\r\nbe started at about 120 degrees Fahrenheit and when it reaches a\r\ndryness of 25 per cent, the temperature may be raised gradually up to\r\n190 degrees.\r\n\r\nIt is exceedingly important that the material be practically at the\r\nsame temperature throughout if perfect drying is to be secured. It\r\nshould be the same temperature in the center of a pile or car as on\r\nthe outside, and the same in the center of each individual piece of\r\nwood as on its surface. This is the effect obtained by natural\r\nair-drying. The outside atmosphere and breezes (natural air\r\ncirculation) are so ample that the heat extracted for drying does not\r\nappreciably change the temperature.\r\n\r\nWhen once the wood has been raised to a high temperature through and\r\nthrough and especially when the surface has been rendered most\r\npermeable to moisture, drying may proceed as rapidly as it can be\r\nforced by artificial circulation, provided the heat lost from the wood\r\nthrough vaporization is constantly replaced by the heat of the kiln.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that to secure an even temperature, a free circulation\r\nof air must be brought in contact with the wood. It is also evident\r\nthat in addition to heat and a circulation of air, the air must be\r\ncharged with a certain amount of moisture to prevent surface drying or\r\ncase-hardening.\r\n\r\nThere are some twenty-five different makes of dry kilns on the market,\r\nwhich fulfill to a varying degree the fundamental requirements.\r\nProbably none of them succeed perfectly in fulfilling all.\r\n\r\nIt is well to have the temperature of a dry kiln controlled by a\r\nthermostat which actuates the valve on the main steam supply pipe. It\r\nis doubly important to maintain a uniform temperature and avoid\r\nfluctuations in the dry kiln, since a change in temperature will\r\ngreatly alter the relative humidity.\r\n\r\nIn artificial drying, temperatures of from 150 to 180 degrees\r\nFahrenheit are usually employed. Pine, spruce, cypress, cedar, etc.,\r\nare dried fresh from the saw, allowing four days for 1-inch stuff.\r\nHardwoods, especially oak, ash, maple, birch, sycamore, etc., are\r\nusually air-seasoned for three to six months to allow the first\r\nshrinkage to take place more gradually, and are then exposed to the\r\nabove temperatures in the kiln for about six to ten days for 1-inch\r\nstuff, other dimensions in proportion.\r\n\r\nFreshly cut poplar and cottonwood are often dried direct from the saw\r\nin a kiln. By employing lower temperatures, 100 to 120 degrees\r\nFahrenheit, green oak, ash, etc., can be seasoned in dry kilns without\r\nmuch injury to the material.\r\n\r\nSteaming and sweating the wood is sometimes resorted to in order to\r\nprevent checking and case-hardening, but not, as has been frequently\r\nasserted, to enable the material to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Air Circulation\r\n\r\nAir circulation is of the utmost importance, since no drying whatever\r\ncan take place when it is lacking. The evaporation of moisture\r\nrequires heat and this must be supplied by the circulating air.\r\nMoreover, the moisture laden air must be constantly removed and fresh,\r\ndrier air substituted. Probably this is the factor which gives more\r\ntrouble in commercial operations than anything else, and the one which\r\ncauses the greatest number of failures.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the air circulate through every part of the kiln\r\nand that the moving air come in contact with every portion of the\r\nmaterial to be dried. In fact, the humidity is dependent upon the\r\ncirculation. If the air stagnates in any portion of the pile, then the\r\ntemperature will drop and the humidity rise to a condition of\r\nsaturation. Drying will not take place at this portion of the pile and\r\nthe material is apt to mould and rot.\r\n\r\nThe method of piling the material on trucks or in the kiln, is\r\ntherefore, of extreme importance. Various methods are in use. Ordinary\r\nflat piling is probably the poorest. Flat piling with open chimney\r\nspaces in the piles is better. But neither method is suitable for a\r\nkiln in which the circulation is mainly vertical.\r\n\r\nEdge piling with stickers running vertically is in use in kilns when\r\nthe heating coils are beneath. This is much better.\r\n\r\nAir being cooled as it comes in contact with a pile of material,\r\nbecomes denser, and consequently tends to sink. Unless the material to\r\nbe dried is so arranged that the air can pass gradually downward\r\nthrough the pile as it cools, poor circulation is apt to result.\r\n\r\nIn edge-piled lumber, with the heating system beneath the piles, the\r\nnatural tendency of the cooled air to descend is opposed by the hot\r\nair beneath which tends to rise. An indeterminate condition is thus\r\nbrought about, resulting in non-uniform drying. It has been found that\r\nair will rise through some layers and descend through others.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Humidity\r\n\r\nHumidity is of prime importance because the rate of drying and\r\nprevention of checking and case-hardening are largely dependent\r\nthereon. It is generally true that the surface of the wood should not\r\ndry more rapidly than the moisture transfuses from the center of the\r\npiece to its surface, otherwise disaster will result. As a sufficient\r\namount of moisture is removed from the wood to maintain the desired\r\nhumidity, it is not good economy to generate moisture in an outside\r\napparatus and force it into a kiln, unless the moisture in the wood is\r\nnot sufficient for this purpose; in that case provision should be made\r\nfor adding any additional moisture that may be required.\r\n\r\nThe rate of evaporation may best be controlled by controlling the\r\namount of vapor present in the air (relative humidity); it should not\r\nbe controlled by reducing the air circulation, since a large\r\ncirculation is needed at all times to supply the necessary heat.\r\n\r\nThe humidity should be graded from 100 per cent at the receiving end\r\nof the kiln, to whatever humidity corresponds with the desired degree\r\nof dryness at the delivery end.\r\n\r\nThe kiln should be so designed that the proper degree may be\r\nmaintained at its every section.\r\n\r\nA fresh piece of sapwood will lose weight in boiling water and can\r\nalso be dried to quite an extent in steam. This proves conclusively\r\nthat a high degree of humidity does not have the detrimental effect on\r\ndrying that is commonly attributed to it. In fact, a proper degree of\r\nhumidity, especially in the loading or receiving end of a kiln, is\r\njust as necessary to good results in drying as getting the proper\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nExperiments have demonstrated also that injury to stock in the way of\r\nchecking, warping, and hollow-horning always develops immediately\r\nafter the stock is taken into the kiln, and is due to the degree of\r\nhumidity being too low. The receiving end of the kiln should always be\r\nkept moist, where the stock has not been steamed before being put into\r\nthe kiln. The reason for this is simple enough. When the air is too\r\ndry it tends to dry the outside of the material first--which is termed\r\n\"case-hardening\"--and in so doing shrinks and closes up the pores of\r\nthe wood. As the stock is moved down the kiln, it absorbs a\r\ncontinually increasing amount of heat, which tends to drive off the\r\nmoisture still present in the center of the stock. The pores on the\r\noutside having been closed up, there is no exit for the vapor or steam\r\nthat is being rapidly formed in the center. It must find its way out\r\nsome way, and in doing so sets up strains, which result either in\r\nchecking, warping, or hollow-horning. If the humidity had been kept\r\nhigher, the outside of the material would not have dried so quickly,\r\nand the pores would have remained open for the exit of moisture from\r\nthe interior of the wood, and this trouble would have been avoided.\r\n\r\nWhere the humidity is kept at a high point in the receiving end of the\r\nkiln, a higher rate of temperature may also be carried, and in that\r\nway the drying process is hastened with comparative safety.\r\n\r\nIt is essential, therefore, to have an ample supply of heat through\r\nthe convection currents of the air; but in the case of wood the rate\r\nof evaporation must be controlled, else checking will occur. This can\r\nbe done by means of the relative humidity, as stated before. It is\r\nclear now that when the air--or, more properly speaking, the space--is\r\ncompletely saturated no evaporation can take place at the given\r\ntemperature. By reducing the humidity, evaporation takes place more\r\nand more rapidly.\r\n\r\nAnother bad feature of an insufficient and non-uniform supply of heat\r\nis that each piece of wood will be heated to the evaporating point on\r\nthe outer surface, the inside remaining cool until considerable drying\r\nhas taken place from the surface. Ordinarily in dry kilns high\r\nhumidity and large circulation of air are antitheses to one another.\r\nTo obtain the high humidity the circulation is either stopped\r\naltogether or greatly reduced, and to reduce the humidity a greater\r\ncirculation is induced by opening the ventilators or otherwise\r\nincreasing the draft. This is evidently not good practice, but as a\r\nrule is unavoidable in most dry kilns of present make. The humidity\r\nshould be raised to check evaporation without reducing the circulation\r\nif possible.\r\n\r\nWhile thin stock, such as cooperage and box stuff is less inclined to\r\ngive trouble by undue checking than 1-inch and thicker, one will find\r\nthat any dry kiln will give more uniform results and, at the same\r\ntime, be more economical in the use of steam, when the humidity and\r\ntemperature is carried at as high a point as possible without injury\r\nto the material to be dried.\r\n\r\nAny well-made dry kiln which will fulfill the conditions required as\r\nto circulation and humidity control should work satisfactorily; but\r\neach case must be studied by itself, and the various factors modified\r\nto suit the peculiar conditions of the problem in hand. In every new\r\ncase the material should be constantly watched and studied and, if\r\nchecking begins, the humidity should be increased until it stops. It\r\nis not reducing the circulation, but adding the necessary moisture to\r\nthe air, that should be depended on to prevent checking. For this\r\npurpose it is well to have steam jets in the kiln so that if needed\r\nthey are ready at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Kiln-drying\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct ways of handling material in dry kilns. One way\r\nis to place the load of lumber in a chamber where it remains in the\r\nsame place throughout the operation, while the conditions of the\r\ndrying medium are varied as the drying progresses. This is the\r\n\"apartment\" kiln or stationary method. The other is to run the lumber\r\nin at one end of the chamber on a wheeled truck and gradually move it\r\nalong until the drying process is completed, when it is taken out at\r\nthe opposite end of the kiln. It is the usual custom in these kilns to\r\nmaintain one end of the chamber moist and the other end dry. This is\r\nknown as the \"progressive\" type of kiln, and is the one most commonly\r\nused in large operations.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the least satisfactory of the two where careful drying\r\nis required, since the conditions cannot be so well regulated and the\r\ntemperatures and humidities are apt to change with any change of wind.\r\nThe apartment method can be arranged so that it will not require any\r\nmore kiln space or any more handling of lumber than the progressive\r\ntype. It does, however, require more intelligent operation, since the\r\nconditions in the drying chamber must be changed as the drying\r\nprogresses. With the progressive type the conditions, once properly\r\nestablished, remain the same.\r\n\r\nTo obtain draft or circulation three methods are in use--by forced\r\ndraft or a blower usually placed outside the kiln, by ventilation, and\r\nby internal circulation and condensation. A great many patents have\r\nbeen taken out on different methods of ventilation, but in actual\r\noperation few kilns work exactly as intended. Frequently the air moves\r\nin the reverse direction for which the ventilators were planned.\r\nSometimes a condenser is used in connection with the blower and the\r\nair is recirculated. It is also--and more satisfactorily--used with\r\nthe gentle internal-gravity currents of air.\r\n\r\nMany patents have been taken out for heating systems. The differences\r\namong these, however, have more to do the mechanical construction than\r\nwith the process of drying. In general, the heating is either direct\r\nor indirect. In the former steam coils are placed in the chamber with\r\nthe lumber, and in the latter the air is heated by either steam coils\r\nor a furnace before it is introduced into the drying chamber.\r\n\r\nMoisture is sometimes supplied by means of free steam jets in the kiln\r\nor in the entering air; but more often the moisture evaporated from\r\nthe lumber is relied upon to maintain the humidity necessary.\r\n\r\nA substance becomes dry by the evaporation of its inherent moisture\r\ninto the surrounding space. If this space be confined it soon becomes\r\nsaturated and the process stops. Hence, constant change is necessary\r\nin order that the moisture given off may be continually carried away.\r\n\r\nIn practice, air movement, is therefore absolutely essential to the\r\nprocess of drying. Heat is merely a useful accessory which serves to\r\ndecrease the time of drying by increasing both the rate of evaporation\r\nand the absorbing power of the surrounding space.\r\n\r\nIt makes no difference whether this space is a vacuum or filled with\r\nair; under either condition it will take up a stated weight of vapor.\r\nFrom this it appears that the vapor molecules find sufficient space\r\nbetween the molecules of air. But the converse is not true, for\r\nsomewhat less air will be contained in a given space saturated with\r\nvapor than in one devoid of moisture. In other words the air does not\r\nseem to find sufficient space between the molecules of vapor.\r\n\r\nIf the temperature of the confined space be increased, opportunity\r\nwill thereby be provided for the vaporization of more water, but if it\r\nbe decreased, its capacity for moisture will be reduced and visible\r\nwater will be deposited. The temperature at which this takes place is\r\nknown as the \"dew-point\" and depends upon the initial degree of\r\nsaturation of the given space; the less the relative saturation the\r\nlower the dew-point.\r\n\r\nCareful piling of the material to be dried, both in the yard and dry\r\nkiln, is essential to good results in drying.\r\n\r\nAir-dried material is not dry, and its moisture is too unevenly\r\ndistributed to insure good behavior after manufacture.\r\n\r\nIt is quite a difficult matter to give specific or absolute correct\r\nweights of any species of timber when thoroughly or properly dried, in\r\norder that one may be guided in these kiln operations, as a great deal\r\ndepends upon the species of wood to be dried, its density, and upon\r\nthe thickness which it has been cut, and its condition when entering\r\nthe drying chamber.\r\n\r\nElm will naturally weigh less than beech, and where the wood is\r\nclose-grained or compact it will weigh more than coarse-grained wood\r\nof the same species, and, therefore, no set rules can be laid down, as\r\ngood judgment only should be used, as the quality of the drying is not\r\npurely one of time. Sometimes the comparatively slow process gives\r\nexcellent results, while to rush a lot of stock through the kiln may\r\nbe to turn it out so poorly seasoned that it will not give\r\nsatisfaction when worked into the finished product. The mistreatment\r\nof the material in this respect results in numerous defects, chief\r\namong which are warping and twisting, checking, case-hardening, and\r\nhoneycombing, or, as sometimes called, hollow-horning.\r\n\r\nSince the proportion of sap and heartwood varies with size, age,\r\nspecies, and individual trees, the following figures as regards weight\r\nmust be regarded as mere approximations:\r\n\r\n\r\n  POUNDS OF WATER LOST IN DRYING 100 POUNDS OF GREEN WOOD IN THE KILN\r\n\r\n=========================================================================\r\n                                                |Sapwood or | Heartwood\r\n                                                |outer part | or interior\r\n=========================================================================\r\n                                                |           |\r\n(1) Pine, cedar, spruce, and fir                |  45-65    |   16-25\r\n(2) Cypress, extremely variable                 |  50-65    |   18-60\r\n(3) Poplar, cottonwood, and basswood            |  60-65    |   40-60\r\n(4) Oak, beech, ash, maple, birch, elm, hickory,|           |\r\n    chestnut, walnut, and sycamore              |  40-50    |   30-40\r\n=========================================================================\r\n\r\nThe lighter kinds have the most water in the sapwood; thus sycamore\r\nhas more water than hickory, etc.\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the drying operations depends a great deal upon the\r\nway in which, the lumber is piled, especially when the humidity is not\r\nregulated. From the theory of drying it is evident that the rate of\r\nevaporation in dry kilns where the humidity is not regulated depends\r\nentirely upon the rate of circulation, other things being equal.\r\nConsequently, those portions of the wood which receive the greatest\r\namount of air dry the most rapidly, and vice versa. The only way,\r\ntherefore, in which anything like uniform drying can take place is\r\nwhere the lumber is so piled that each portion of it comes in contact\r\nwith the same amount of air.\r\n\r\nIn the Forestry Service kiln (Fig. 30), where the degree of relative\r\nhumidity is used to control the rate of drying, the amount of\r\ncirculation makes little difference, provided it exceeds a certain\r\namount. It is desirable to pile the lumber so as to offer as little\r\nfrictional resistance as possible and at the same time secure uniform\r\ncirculation. If circulation is excessive in any place it simply means\r\nwaste of energy but no other injury to the lumber.\r\n\r\nThe best method of piling is one which permits the heated air to pass\r\nthrough the pile in a somewhat downward direction. The natural\r\ntendency of the cooled air to descend is thus taken advantage of in\r\nassisting the circulation in the kiln. This is especially important\r\nwhen cold or green lumber is first introduced into the kiln. But even\r\nwhen the lumber has become warmed the cooling due to the evaporation\r\nincreases the density of the mixture of the air and vapor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Kiln-drying Gum\r\n\r\nThe following article was published by the United States Forestry\r\nService as to the best method of kiln-drying gum:\r\n\r\n=Piling.=--Perhaps the most important factor in good kiln-drying,\r\nespecially in the case of the gums, is the method of piling. It is our\r\nopinion that proper and very careful piling will greatly reduce the\r\nloss due to warping. A good method of piling is to place the lumber\r\nlengthwise of the kiln and on an incline cross-wise. The warm air\r\nshould rise at the higher side of the pile and descend between the\r\ncourses of lumber. The reason for this is very simple and the\r\nprinciple has been applied in the manufacture of the best ice boxes\r\nfor some time. The most efficient refrigerators are iced at the side,\r\nthe ice compartment opening to the cooling chamber at the top and\r\nbottom. The warm air from above is cooled by melting the ice. It then\r\nbecomes denser and settles down into the main chamber. The articles in\r\nthe cooling room warm the air as they cool, so it rises to the top and\r\nagain comes in contact with the ice, thus completing the cycle. The\r\nrate of this natural circulation is automatically regulated by the\r\ntemperature of the articles in the cooling chamber and by the amount\r\nof ice in the icing compartment; hence the efficiency of such a box is\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nNow let us apply this principle to the drying of lumber. First we must\r\nunderstand that as long as the lumber is moist and drying, it will\r\nalways be cooler than the surrounding air, the amount of this\r\ndifference being determined by the rate of drying and the moisture in\r\nthe wood. As the lumber dries, its temperature gradually rises until\r\nit is equal to that of the air, when perfect dryness results. With\r\nthis fact in mind it is clear that the function of the lumber in a\r\nkiln is exactly analogous to that of the ice in an ice box; that is,\r\nit is the cooling agent. Similarly, the heating pipes in a dry kiln\r\nbring about the same effect as the articles of food in the ice box in\r\nthat they serve to heat the air. Therefore, the air will be cooled by\r\nthe lumber, causing it to pass downward through the piles. If the\r\nheating units are placed at the sides of the kiln, the action of the\r\nair in a good ice box is duplicated in the kiln. The significant point\r\nin this connection is that, the greener and colder the lumber, the\r\nfaster is the circulation. This is a highly desirable feature.\r\n\r\nA second vital point is that as the wood becomes gradually drier the\r\ncirculation automatically decreases, thus resulting in increased\r\nefficiency, because there is no need for circulation greater than\r\nenough to maintain the humidity of the air as it leaves the lumber\r\nabout the same as it enters. Therefore, we advocate either the\r\nlongitudinal side-wise inclined pile or edge stacking, the latter\r\nbeing much preferable when possible. Of course the piles in our kiln\r\nwere small and could not be weighted properly, so the best results as\r\nto reducing warping were not obtained.\r\n\r\n=Preliminary Steaming.=--Because the fibres of the gums become plastic\r\nwhile moist and hot without causing defects, it is desirable to heat\r\nthe air-dried lumber to about 200 degrees Fahrenheit in saturated\r\nsteam at atmospheric pressure in order to reduce the warping. This\r\ntreatment also furnishes a means of heating the lumber very rapidly.\r\nIt is probably a good way to stop the sap-staining of green lumber, if\r\nit is steamed while green. We have not investigated the other effects\r\nof steaming green gum, however, so we hesitate to recommend it.\r\n\r\nTemperatures as high as 210 degrees Fahrenheit were used with no\r\napparent harm to the material. The best result was obtained with the\r\ntemperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit, after the first preliminary\r\nheating in steam to 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Higher temperatures may be\r\nused with air-dried gum, however.\r\n\r\nThe best method of humidity control proved to be to reduce the\r\nrelative humidity of the air from 100 per cent (saturated steam) very\r\ncarefully at first and then more rapidly to 30 per cent in about four\r\ndays. If the change is too marked immediately after the steaming\r\nperiod, checking will invariably result. Under these temperature and\r\nhumidity conditions the stock was dried from 15 per cent moisture,\r\nbased on the dry wood weight, to 6 per cent in five days' time. The\r\nloss due to checking was about 5 per cent, based on the actual footage\r\nloss, not on commercial grades.\r\n\r\n=Final Steaming.=--From time to time during the test runs the material\r\nwas resawed to test for case-hardening. The stock dried in five days\r\nshowed slight case-hardening, so it was steamed at atmospheric\r\npressure for 36 minutes near the close of the run, with the result\r\nthat when dried off again the stresses were no longer present. The\r\nmaterial from one run was steamed for three hours at atmospheric\r\npressure and proved very badly case-hardened, but in the reverse\r\ndirection. It seems possible that by testing for the amount of\r\ncase-hardening one might select a final steaming period which would\r\neliminate all stresses in the wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Kiln-drying of Green Red Gum\r\n\r\nThe following article was published by the United States Forestry\r\nService on the kiln-drying of green red gum:\r\n\r\nA short time ago fifteen fine, red-gum logs 16 feet long were received\r\nfrom Sardis, Miss. They were in excellent condition and quite green.\r\n\r\nIt has been our belief that if the gum could be kiln-dried directly\r\nfrom the saw, a number of the difficulties in seasoning might be\r\navoided. Therefore, we have undertaken to find out whether or not such\r\na thing is feasible. The green logs now at the laboratory are to be\r\nused in this investigation. One run of a preliminary nature has just\r\nbeen made, the method and results of which I will now tell.\r\n\r\nThis method was really adapted to the drying of Southern pine, and one\r\nlog of the green gum was cut into 1-inch stock and dried with the\r\npine. The heartwood contained many knots and some checks, although it\r\nwas in general of quite good quality. The sapwood was in fine\r\ncondition and almost as white as snow.\r\n\r\nThis material was edge-stacked with one crosser at either end and one\r\nat the center, of the 16-foot board. This is sufficient for the pine,\r\nbut was absolutely inadequate for drying green gum. A special\r\nshrinkage take-up was applied at the three points. The results proved\r\nvery interesting in spite of the warping which was expected with but\r\nthree crossers in 16 feet. The method of circulation described was\r\nused. It is our belief that edge piling is best for this method.\r\n\r\nThis method of kiln-drying depends on the maintenance of a high\r\nvelocity of slightly superheated steam through the lumber. In few\r\nwords, the object is to maintain the temperature of the vapor as it\r\nleaves the lumber at slightly above 212 degrees Fahrenheit. In order\r\nto accomplish this result, it is necessary to maintain the high\r\nvelocity of circulation. As the wood dries, the superheat may be\r\nincreased until a temperature of 225 degrees or 230 degrees Fahrenheit\r\nof the exit air is recorded.\r\n\r\nThe 1-inch green gum was dried from 20.1 per cent to 11.4 per cent\r\nmoisture, based on the dry wood weight in 45 hours. The loss due to\r\nchecking was 10 per cent. Nearly every knot in the heartwood was\r\nchecked, showing that as the knots could be eliminated in any case,\r\nthis loss might not be so great. It was significant that practically\r\nall of the checking occurred in the heartwood. The loss due to warping\r\nwas 22 per cent. Of course this was large; but not nearly enough\r\ncrossers were used for the gum. It is our opinion that this loss due\r\nto warping can be very much reduced by using at least eight crossers\r\nand providing for taking up of the shrinkage. A feature of this\r\nprocess which is very important is that the method absolutely prevents\r\nall sap staining.\r\n\r\nAnother delightful surprise was the manner in which the superheated\r\nsteam method of drying changed the color of the sapwood from pure\r\nwhite to a beautifully uniform, clean-looking, cherry red color which\r\nvery closely resembles that of the heartwood. This method is not new\r\nby any means, as several patents have been granted on the steaming of\r\ngum to render the sapwood more nearly the color of the heartwoods. The\r\nmethod of application in kiln-drying green gum we believe to be new,\r\nhowever. Other methods for kiln-drying this green stock are to be\r\ntested until the proper process is developed. We expect to have\r\nsomething interesting to report in the near future.[1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: The above test was made at the United States\r\n    Forestry Service Laboratory, Madison, Wis.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECTION XII\r\n\r\n                          TYPES OF DRY KILNS\r\n\r\n                     DIFFERENT TYPES OF DRY KILNS\r\n\r\n\r\nDry kilns as in use to-day are divided into two classes: The \"pipe\" or\r\n\"moist-air\" kiln, in which natural draft is relied upon for\r\ncirculation and, the \"blower\" or \"hot blast\" kiln, in which the\r\ncirculation is produced by fans or blowers. Both classes have their\r\nadherents and either one will produce satisfactory results if properly\r\noperated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   The \"Blower\" or \"Hot Blast\" Kiln\r\n\r\nThe blower kiln in its various types has been in use so long that it\r\nis hardly necessary to give to it a lengthy introduction. These kilns\r\nat their inauguration were a wonderful improvement over the old style\r\n\"bake-oven\" or \"sweat box\" kiln then employed, both on account of the\r\nimproved quality of the material and the rapidity at which it was\r\ndried.\r\n\r\nThese blower kilns have undergone steady improvement, not only in the\r\napparatus and equipment, but also in their general design, method of\r\nintroducing air, and provision for controlling the temperature and\r\nhumidity. With this type of kiln the circulation is always under\r\nabsolute control and can be adjusted to suit the conditions, which\r\nnecessarily vary with the conditions of the material to be dried and\r\nthe quantity to be put through the kiln.\r\n\r\nIn either the blower or moist-air type of dry kiln, however, it is\r\nabsolutely essential, in order to secure satisfactory results, both as\r\nto rapidity in drying and good quality of stock, that the kiln be so\r\ndesigned that the temperature and humidity, together with circulation,\r\nare always under convenient control. Any dry kiln in which this has\r\nnot been carefully considered will not give the desired results.\r\n\r\nIn the old style blower kiln, while the circulation and temperature\r\nwas very largely under the operator's control, it was next to\r\nimpossible to produce conditions in the receiving end of the kiln so\r\nthat the humidity could be kept at the proper point. In fact, this was\r\none reason why the natural draft, or so-called moist-air kiln was\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the moist-air kiln served as an education to kiln\r\ndesigners and manufacturers, in that it has shown conclusively the\r\nvalue of a proper degree of humidity in the receiving end of any\r\nprogressive dry kiln, and it has been of special benefit also in that\r\nit gave the manufacturers of blower kilns an idea as to how to improve\r\nthe design of their type of kiln to overcome the difficulty referred\r\nto in the old style blower kilns. This has now been remedied, and in a\r\ndecidedly simple manner, as is usually the case with all things that\r\npossess merit.\r\n\r\nIt was found that by returning from one third to one half of the moist\r\nair _after_ having passed through the kiln back to the fan room and by\r\nmixing it with the fresh and more or less dry air going into the\r\ndrying room, that the humidity could be kept under convenient control.\r\n\r\nThe amount of air that can be returned from a kiln of this class\r\ndepends upon three things: (1) The condition of the material when\r\nentering the drying room; (2) the rapidity with which the material is\r\nto be dried; and (3) the condition of the outside atmosphere. In the\r\nwinter season it will be found that a larger proportion of air may be\r\nreturned to the drying room than in summer, as the air during the\r\nwinter season contains considerably less moisture and as a consequence\r\nis much drier. This is rather a fortunate coincidence, as, when the\r\nkiln is being operated in this manner, it will be much more economical\r\nin its steam consumption.\r\n\r\nIn the summer season, when the outside atmosphere is saturated to a\r\nmuch greater extent, it will be found that it is not possible to\r\nreturn as great a quantity of air to the drying room, although there\r\nhave been instances of kilns of this class, which in operation have\r\nhad all the air returned and found to give satisfactory results. This\r\nis an unusual condition, however, and can only be accounted for by\r\nsome special or peculiar condition surrounding the installation.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, the desired amount of humidity in a blower type of\r\nkiln is obtained by the addition of a steam spray in the receiving end\r\nof the kiln, much in the same manner as that used in the moist-air\r\nkilns. This method is not as economical as returning the\r\nmoisture-laden air from the drying room as explained in the preceding\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\nWith the positive circulation that may be obtained in a blower kiln,\r\nand with the conditions of temperature and humidity under convenient\r\ncontrol, this type of kiln has the elements most necessary to produce\r\nsatisfactory drying in the quickest possible elapsed time.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from this, however, that this class of dry\r\nkiln may be installed and satisfactory results obtained regardless of\r\nhow it is handled. A great deal of the success of any dry kiln--or any\r\nother apparatus, for that matter--depends upon intelligent operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Operation of the \"Blower\" Dry Kiln\r\n\r\nIt is essential that the operator be supplied with proper facilities\r\nto keep a record of the material as it is placed into the drying room,\r\nand when it is taken out. An accurate record should be kept of the\r\ntemperature every two or three hours, for the different thicknesses\r\nand species of lumber, that he may have some reliable data to guide\r\nhim in future cases.\r\n\r\nAny man possessing ordinary intelligence can operate dry kilns and\r\nsecure satisfactory results, providing he will use good judgment and\r\nfollow the basic instructions as outlined below:\r\n\r\n     1. When cold and before putting into operation, heat the\r\n     apparatus slowly until all pipes are hot, then start the fan\r\n     or blower, gradually bringing it up to its required speed.\r\n\r\n     2. See that _all_ steam supply valves are kept wide open,\r\n     unless you desire to lengthen the time required to dry the\r\n     material.\r\n\r\n     3. When using exhaust steam, the valve from the header\r\n     (which is a separate drip, independent of the trap\r\n     connection) must be kept wide open, but must be closed when\r\n     live steam is used on that part of the heater.\r\n\r\n     4. The engines as supplied by the manufacturers are\r\n     constructed to operate the fan or blower at a proper speed\r\n     with its throttle valve wide open, and with not less than 80\r\n     pounds pressure of steam.\r\n\r\n     5. If the return steam trap does not discharge regularly, it\r\n     is important that it be opened and thoroughly cleaned and\r\n     the valve seat re-ground.\r\n\r\n     6. As good air circulation is as essential as the proper\r\n     degree of heat, and as the volume of air and its contact\r\n     with the material to be dried depends upon the volume\r\n     delivered by the fan or blower, it is necessary to maintain\r\n     a regular and uniform speed of the engine.\r\n\r\n     7. Atmospheric openings must always be maintained in the fan\r\n     or heater room for fresh air supply.\r\n\r\n     8. Successful drying cannot be accomplished without ample\r\n     and free circulation of air at all times.\r\n\r\nIf the above instructions are fully carried out, and good judgment\r\nused in the handling and operation of the blower kiln, no difficulties\r\nshould be encountered in successfully drying the materials at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The \"Pipe\" or \"Moist-air\" Dry Kiln\r\n\r\nWhile in the blower class of dry kiln, the circulation is obtained by\r\nforced draft with the aid of fans or blowers, in the Moist-air kilns\r\n(see Fig. 31); the circulation is obtained by natural draft only,\r\naided by the manipulation of dampers installed at the receiving end of\r\nthe drying room, which lead to vertical flues through a stack to the\r\noutside atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe heat in these kilns is obtained by condensing steam in coils of\r\npipe, which are placed underneath the material to be dried. As the\r\ndegree of heat required, and steam pressure govern the amount of\r\nradiation, there are several types of radiating coils. In Fig. 32 will\r\nbe seen the Single Row Heating Coils for live or high pressure steam,\r\nwhich are used when the low temperature is required. Figure 33 shows\r\nthe Double (or 2) Row Heating Coils for live or high pressure steam.\r\nThis apparatus is used when a medium temperature is required. In Fig.\r\n34 will be seen the Vertical Type Heating Coils which is recommended\r\nwhere exhaust or low-pressure steam is to be used, or may be used with\r\nlive or high-pressure steam when high temperatures are desired.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 31. Section through a typical Moist-air\r\n    Dry Kiln.]\r\n\r\nThese heating coils are usually installed in sections, which permit\r\nany degree of heat from the minimum to the maximum to be maintained by\r\nthe elimination of, or the addition of, any number of heating\r\nsections. This gives a dry kiln for the drying of green softwoods, or\r\nby shutting off a portion of the radiating coils--thus reducing the\r\ntemperature--a dry kiln for drying hardwoods, that will not stand the\r\nmaximum degree of heat.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 32. Single Pipe Heating Apparatus for Dry\r\n    Kilns, arranged for the Use of Live Steam. For Low\r\n    Temperatures.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 33. Double Pipe Heating Apparatus for Dry\r\n    Kilns, arranged for the Use of Live Steam. For Medium\r\n    Temperatures.]\r\n\r\nIn the Moist-air or Natural Draft type of dry kiln, any degree of\r\nhumidity, from clear and dry to a dense fog may be obtained; this is\r\nin fact, the main and most important feature of this type of dry kiln,\r\nand the most essential one in the drying of hardwoods.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally understood that the length of a kiln has any\r\neffect upon the quantity of material that may be put through it, but\r\nit is a fact nevertheless that long kilns are much more effective, and\r\nproduce a better quality of stock in less time than kilns of shorter\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nExperience has proven that a kiln from 80 to 125 feet in length will\r\nproduce the best results, and it should be the practice, where\r\npossible, to keep them within these figures. The reason for this is\r\nthat in a long kiln there is a greater drop in temperature between the\r\ndischarge end and the green or receiving end of the kiln.\r\n\r\nIt is very essential that the conditions in the receiving end of the\r\nkiln, as far as the temperature and humidity are concerned, must go\r\nhand in hand.\r\n\r\nIt has also been found that in a long kiln the desired conditions may\r\nbe obtained with higher temperatures than with a shorter kiln;\r\nconsequently higher temperatures may be carried in the discharge end\r\nof the kiln, thereby securing greater rapidity in drying. It is not\r\nunusual to find that a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit is\r\ncarried in the discharge end of a long dry kiln with safety, without\r\nin any way injuring the quality of the material, although, it would be\r\nbetter not to exceed 180 degrees in the discharge end, and about 120\r\ndegrees in the receiving or green end in order to be on the safe side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Operation of the \"Moist-air\" Dry Kiln\r\n\r\nTo obtain the best results these kilns should be kept in continuous\r\noperation when once started, that is, they should be operated\r\ncontinuously day and night. When not in operation at night or on\r\nSundays, and the kiln is used to season green stock direct from the\r\nsaw, the large doors at both ends of the kiln should be opened wide,\r\nor the material to be dried will \"sap stain.\"\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 34. Vertical Pipe Heating Apparatus for\r\n    Dry Kilns; may be used in Connection with either Live or\r\n    Exhaust Steam for High or Low Temperatures.]\r\n\r\nIt is highly important that the operator attending any drying\r\napparatus keep a minute and accurate record of the condition of the\r\nmaterial as it is placed into the drying room, and its final condition\r\nwhen taken out.\r\n\r\nRecords of the temperature and humidity should be taken frequently and\r\nat stated periods for the different thicknesses and species of\r\nmaterial, in order that he may have reliable data to guide him in\r\nfuture operations.\r\n\r\nThe following facts should be taken into consideration when operating\r\nthe Moist-air dry kiln:\r\n\r\n     1. Before any material has been placed in the drying room,\r\n     the steam should be turned into the heating or radiating\r\n     coils, gradually warming them, and bringing the temperature\r\n     in the kiln up to the desired degree.\r\n\r\n     2. Care should be exercised that there is sufficient\r\n     humidity in the receiving or loading end of the kiln, in\r\n     order to guard against checking, case-hardening, etc.\r\n     Therefore it is essential that the steam spray at the\r\n     receiving or loading end of the kiln be properly\r\n     manipulated.\r\n\r\n     3. As the temperature depends principally upon the pressure\r\n     of steam carried in the boilers, maintain a steam pressure\r\n     of not less than 80 pounds at all times; it may range as\r\n     high as 100 pounds. The higher the temperature with its\r\n     relatively high humidity the more rapidly the drying will be\r\n     accomplished.\r\n\r\n     4. Since air circulation is as essential as the proper\r\n     degree of heat, and as its contact with the material to be\r\n     dried depends upon its free circulation, it is necessary\r\n     that the dampers for its admittance into, and its exit from,\r\n     the drying room be efficiently and properly operated.\r\n     Successful drying cannot be accomplished without ample and\r\n     free circulation of air at all times during the drying\r\n     process.\r\n\r\nIf the above basic principles are carefully noted and followed out,\r\nand good common sense used in the handling and operation of the kiln\r\napparatus, no serious difficulties should arise against the successful\r\ndrying of the materials at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Choice of Drying Method\r\n\r\nAt this point naturally arises the question: Which of the two classes\r\nof dry kilns, the \"Moist-air\" or \"Blower\" kiln is the better adapted\r\nfor my particular needs?\r\n\r\nThis must be determined entirely by the species of wood to be dried,\r\nits condition when it goes into the kiln, and what kind of finished\r\nproduct is to be manufactured from it.\r\n\r\nAlmost any species of hardwood which has been subjected to\r\nair-seasoning for three months or more may be dried rapidly and in the\r\nbest possible condition for glue-jointing and fine finishing with a\r\n\"Blower\" kiln, but green hardwood, direct from the saw, can only be\r\nsuccessfully dried (if at all) in a \"Moist-air\" kiln.\r\n\r\nMost furniture factories have considerable bent stock which must of\r\nnecessity be thoroughly steamed before bending. By steaming, the\r\ninitial process of the Moist-air kiln has been consummated. Hence, the\r\nBlower kiln is better adapted to the drying of such stock than the\r\nMoist-air kiln would be, as the stock has been thoroughly soaked by\r\nthe preliminary steaming, and all that is required is sufficient heat\r\nto volatilize the moisture, and a strong circulation of air to remove\r\nit as it comes to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe Moist-air kiln is better adapted to the drying of tight cooperage\r\nstock, while the Blower kiln is almost universally used throughout the\r\nslack cooperage industry for the drying of its products.\r\n\r\nFor the drying of heavy timbers, planks, blocks, carriage stock, etc.,\r\nand for all species of hardwood thicker than one inch, the Moist-air\r\nkiln is undoubtedly the best.\r\n\r\nBoth types of kilns are equally well adapted to the drying of 1-inch\r\ngreen Norway and white pine, elm, hemlock, and such woods as are used\r\nin the manufacture of flooring, ceiling, siding, shingles, hoops, tub\r\nand pail stock, etc.\r\n\r\nThe selection of one or the other for such work is largely matter of\r\npersonal opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Kilns of Different Types\r\n\r\nAll dry kilns as in use to-day are divided as to method of drying into\r\ntwo classes:\r\n\r\n    The \"Pipe\" or \"Moist-air\" kiln;\r\n    The \"Blower\" or \"Hot Blast\" kiln;\r\n\r\nboth of which have been fully explained in a previous article.\r\n\r\nThe above two classes are again subdivided into five different types\r\nof dry kilns as follows:\r\n\r\n    The \"Progressive\" kiln;\r\n    The \"Apartment\" kiln;\r\n    The \"Pocket\" kiln;\r\n    The \"Tower\" kiln;\r\n    The \"Box\" kiln.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      The \"Progressive\" Dry Kiln\r\n\r\nDry kilns constructed so that the material goes in at one end and is\r\ntaken out at the opposite end are called Progressive dry kilns, from\r\nthe fact that the material gradually progresses through the kiln from\r\none stage to another while drying (see Fig. 31).\r\n\r\nIn the operation of the Progressive kiln, the material is first\r\nsubjected to a sweating or steaming process at the receiving or\r\nloading end of the kiln with a low temperature and a relative high\r\nhumidity. It then gradually progresses through the kiln into higher\r\ntemperatures and lower humidities, as well as changes of air\r\ncirculation, until it reaches the final stage at the discharge end of\r\nthe kiln.\r\n\r\nProgressive kilns, in order to produce the most satisfactory results,\r\nespecially in the drying of hardwoods or heavy softwood timbers,\r\nshould be not less than 100 feet in length (see Fig. 35).\r\n\r\nIn placing this type of kiln in operation, the following instructions\r\nshould be carefully followed:\r\n\r\nWhen steam has been turned into the heating coils, and the kiln is\r\nfairly warm, place the first car of material to be dried in the drying\r\nroom--preferably in the morning--about 25 feet from the kiln door on\r\nthe receiving or loading end of the kiln, blocking the wheels so that\r\nit will remain stationary.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 35. Exterior View of Four Progressive Dry\r\n    Kilns, each 140 Feet long by 18 Feet wide. Cross-wise piling,\r\n    fire-proof construction.]\r\n\r\nFive hours later, or about noon, run in the second car and stop it\r\nabout five feet from the first one placed in the drying room. Five\r\nhours later, or in the evening push car number two up against the\r\nfirst car; then run in car number three, stopping it about five feet\r\nfrom car number two.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the second day, push car number three against the\r\nothers, and then move them all forward about 25 feet, and then run in\r\ncar number four, stopping it about five feet from the car in advance\r\nof it. Five hours later, or about noon, run in car number five and\r\nstop it about five feet from car number four. In the evening or about\r\nfive hours later, push these cars against the ones ahead, and run in\r\nloaded car number six, stopping it about five feet from the preceding\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the third day, move all the cars forward about six\r\nfeet; then run in loaded car number seven stop it about four feet from\r\nthe car preceding it. Five hours later or about noon push this car\r\nagainst those in advance of it, and run in loaded car number eight\r\nmoving all cars forward about six feet, and continue in this manner\r\nuntil the full complement of cars have been placed in the kiln. When\r\nthe kiln has been filled, remove car number one and push all the\r\nremaining cars forward and run in the next loaded car, and continue in\r\nthis manner as long as the kiln is in operation.\r\n\r\nAs the temperature depends principally upon the pressure of steam,\r\nmaintain a steam pressure of not less than 80 pounds at all times; it\r\nmay range up to as high as 100 pounds. The higher the temperature with\r\na relatively higher humidity the more rapidly the drying will be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIf the above instructions are carried out, the temperatures,\r\nhumidities, and air circulation properly manipulated, there should be\r\ncomplete success in the handling of this type of dry kiln.\r\n\r\nThe Progressive type of dry kiln is adapted to such lines of\r\nmanufacture that have large quantities of material to kiln-dry where\r\nthe species to be dried is of a similiar nature or texture, and does\r\nnot vary to any great extent in its thickness, such, for instance, as:\r\n\r\n    Oak flooring plants;\r\n    Maple flooring plants;\r\n    Cooperage plants;\r\n    Large box plants;\r\n    Furniture factories; etc.\r\n\r\nIn the selection of this kind of dry kiln, consideration should be\r\ngiven to the question of ground space of sufficient length or\r\ndimension to accommodate a kiln of proper length for successful\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The \"Apartment\" Dry Kiln\r\n\r\nThe Apartment system of dry kilns are primarily designed for the\r\ndrying of different kinds or sizes of material at the same time, a\r\nseparate room or apartment being devoted to each species or size when\r\nthe quantity is sufficient (see Fig. 36).\r\n\r\nThese kilns are sometimes built single or in batteries of two or more,\r\ngenerally not exceeding 40 or 50 feet in length with doors and\r\nplatforms at both ends the same as the Progressive kilns; but in\r\noperation each kiln is entirely filled at one loading and then closed,\r\nand the entire contents dried at one time, then emptied and again\r\nrecharged.\r\n\r\nAny number of apartments may be built, and each apartment may be\r\narranged to handle any number of cars, generally about three or four,\r\nor they may be so constructed that the material is piled directly upon\r\nthe floor of the drying room.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 36. Exterior View of Six Apartment Dry\r\n    Kilns, each 10 Feet wide by 52 Feet long, End-wise Piling.\r\n    They are entirely of fire-proof construction and equipped\r\n    with double doors (Hussey asbestos outside and canvas\r\n    inside), and are also equipped with humidity and air control\r\n    dampers, which may be operated from the outside without\r\n    opening the kiln doors, which is a very good feature.]\r\n\r\nWhen cars are used, it is well to have a transfer car at each end of\r\nthe kilns, and stub tracks for holding cars of dry material, and for\r\nthe loading of the unseasoned stock, as in this manner the kilns may\r\nbe kept in full operation at all times.\r\n\r\nIn this type of dry kiln the material receives the same treatment and\r\nprocess that it would in a Progressive kiln. The advantages of\r\nApartment kilns is manifest where certain conditions require the\r\ndrying of numerous kinds as well as thicknesses of material at one and\r\nthe same time. This method permits of several short drying rooms or\r\napartments so that it is not necessary to mix hardwoods and softwoods,\r\nor thick and thin material in the same kiln room.\r\n\r\nIn these small kilns the circulation is under perfect control, so that\r\nthe efficiency is equal to that of the more extensive plants, and will\r\nreadily appeal to manufacturers whose output calls for the prompt and\r\nconstant seasoning of a large variety of small stock, rather than a\r\nlarge volume of material of uniform size and grade.\r\n\r\nApartment kilns are recommended for industries where conditions\r\nrequire numerous kinds and thicknesses of material to be dried, such\r\nas:\r\n\r\n    Furniture factories;\r\n    Piano factories;\r\n    Interior woodwork mills;\r\n    Planing mills; etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The \"Pocket\" Dry Kiln\r\n\r\n\"Pocket\" dry kilns (see Fig. 37) are generally built in batteries of\r\nseveral pockets. They have the tracks level and the lumber goes in and\r\nout at the same end. Each drying room is entirely filled at one time,\r\nthe material is dried and then removed and the kiln again recharged.\r\n\r\nThe length of \"Pocket\" kilns ranges generally from 14 feet to about 32\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe interior equipment for this type of dry kiln is arranged very\r\nsimiliar to that used in the Apartment kiln. The heating or radiating\r\ncoils and steam spray jets extend the whole length of the drying room,\r\nand are arranged for the use of either live or exhaust steam, as\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as Pocket kilns have doors at one end only, this feature\r\neliminates a certain amount of door exposure, which conduces towards\r\neconomy in operation.\r\n\r\nIn operating Pocket kilns, woods of different texture and thickness\r\nshould be separated and placed in different drying rooms, and each\r\nkiln adjusted and operated to accommodate the peculiarities of the\r\nspecies and thickness of the material to be dried.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 37. Exterior View of Five Pocket Dry\r\n    Kilns, built in Two Batteries with the Front of each Set\r\n    facing the other, and a Transfer System between. They are\r\n    also equipped with the asbestos doors.]\r\n\r\nNaturally, the more complex the conditions of manufacturing wood\r\nproducts in any industry, the more difficult will be the proper\r\ndrying of same. Pocket kilns, are, therefore, recommended for\r\nfactories having several different kinds and thicknesses of material\r\nto dry in small quantities of each, such as:\r\n\r\n    Planing mills;\r\n    Chair factories;\r\n    Furniture factories;\r\n    Sash and door factories; etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The \"Tower\" Dry Kiln\r\n\r\nThe so-called \"Tower\" dry kiln (see Fig. 38) is designed for the rapid\r\ndrying of small stuff in quantities. Although the general form of\r\nconstruction and the capacity of the individual bins or drying rooms\r\nmay vary, the same essential method of operation is common to all.\r\nThat is, the material itself, such as wooden novelties, loose staves,\r\nand heading for tubs, kits, and pails, for box stuff, kindling wood,\r\netc., is dumped directly into the drying rooms from above, or through\r\nthe roof, in such quantities as effectually to fill the bin, from\r\nwhich it is finally removed when dry, through the doors at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThese dry kilns are usually operated as \"Blower\" kilns, the heating\r\napparatus is generally located in a separate room or building adjacent\r\nto the main structure or drying rooms, and arranged so that the hot\r\nair discharged through the inlet duct (see illustration) is thoroughly\r\ndistributed beneath a lattice floor upon which rests the material to\r\nbe dried. Through this floor the air passes directly upward, between\r\nand around the stock, and finally returns to the fan or heating room.\r\n\r\nThis return air duct is so arranged that by means of dampers, leading\r\nfrom each drying room, the air may be returned in any quantity to the\r\nfan room where it is mixed with fresh air and again used. This is one\r\nof the main features of economy of the blower system of drying, as by\r\nthe employment of this return air system, considerable saving may be\r\nmade in the amount of steam required for drying.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 38. Exterior and Sectional View of a\r\n    Battery of Tower Dry Kilns. This is a \"Blower\" or \"Hot Blast\"\r\n    type, and shows the arrangement of the fan blower, engine,\r\n    etc. This type of dry kin is used principally for the\r\n    seasoning of small, loose material.]\r\n\r\nThe lattice floors in this type of dry kiln are built on an incline,\r\nwhich arrangement materially lessens the cost, and increases the\r\nconvenience with which the dried stock may be removed from the bins or\r\ndrying rooms.\r\n\r\nIn operation, the material is conveyed in cars or trucks on an\r\noverhead trestle--which is inclosed--from which the material to be\r\ndried is dumped directly into the drying rooms or bins, through\r\nhoppers arranged for that purpose thereby creating considerable saving\r\nin the handling of the material to be dried into the kiln. The entire\r\narrangement thus secures the maximum capacity, with a minimum amount\r\nof floor space, with the least expense. Of course, the higher these\r\nkilns are built, the less relative cost for a given result in the\r\namount of material dried.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, these kilns are built less in height and up against\r\nan embankment so that teamloads of material may be run directly onto\r\nthe roof of the kilns, and dumped through the hoppers into the drying\r\nrooms or bins, thus again reducing to a minimum the cost of this\r\nhandling.\r\n\r\nThe return air duct plays an important part in both of these methods\r\nof filling, permitting the air to become saturated to the maximum\r\ndesired, and utilizing much of the heat contained therein, which would\r\notherwise escape to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe \"Tower\" kiln is especially adapted to factories of the following\r\nclass:\r\n\r\n    Sawmills;\r\n    Novelty factories;\r\n    Woodenware factories;\r\n    Tub and pail factories; etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The \"Box\" Dry Kiln\r\n\r\nThe \"Box\" kiln shown in Figure 39 is an exterior view of a kiln of\r\nthis type which is 20 feet wide, 19 feet deep, and 14 feet high, which\r\nis the size generally used when the space will permit.\r\n\r\nBox kilns are used mostly where only a small quantity of material is\r\nto be dried. They are not equipped with trucks or cars, the material\r\nto be dried being piled upon a raised platform inside the drying\r\nroom. This arrangement, therefore, makes them of less cost than the\r\nother types of dry kilns.\r\n\r\nThey are particularly adapted to any and all species and size of\r\nlumber to be dried in very small quantities.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 39. Exterior view of the Box Dry Kiln.\r\n    This particular kiln is 20 feet wide, 19 feet deep and 14\r\n    feet high. Box kilns are used mostly where only a small\r\n    amount of kiln-dried lumber of various sizes is required.\r\n    They are not equipped with trucks or cars, and therefore cost\r\n    less to construct than any other type of dry kiln.]\r\n\r\nIn these small kilns the circulation is under perfect control, so that\r\nthe efficiency is equal to that of the more extensive plants.\r\n\r\nThese special kilns will readily appeal to manufacturers, whose output\r\ncalls for the prompt and constant seasoning of a large variety of\r\nsmall stock, rather than a large volume material of uniform size and\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SECTION XIII\r\n\r\n                         DRY KILN SPECIALTIES\r\n\r\n                    KILN CARS AND METHOD OF LOADING\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin recent years, the edge-wise piling of lumber (see Figs. 40 and\r\n41), upon kiln cars has met with considerable favor on account of its\r\nmany advantages over the older method of flat piling. It has been\r\nproven that lumber stacked edge-wise dries more uniformly and rapidly,\r\nand with practically no warping or twisting of the material, and that\r\nit is finally discharged from the dry kiln in a much better and\r\nbrighter condition. This method of piling also considerably increases\r\nthe holding and consequent drying capacities of the dry kiln by reason\r\nof the increased carrying capacities of the kiln cars, and the shorter\r\nperiod of time required for drying the material.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 40. Car Loaded with Lumber on its Edges\r\n    by the Automatic Stacker, to go into the Dry Kiln cross-wise.\r\n    Equipped with two edge piling kiln trucks.]\r\n\r\nIn Figures 42 and 43 are shown different views of the automatic lumber\r\nstacker for edge-wise piling of lumber on kiln cars. Many users of\r\nautomatic stackers report that the grade of their lumber is raised to\r\nsuch an extent that the system would be profitable for this reason\r\nalone, not taking into consideration the added saving in time and\r\nlabor, which to anyone's mind should be the most important item.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 41. Car Loaded with Lumber on its Edges\r\n    by the Automatic Stacker, to go into the Dry Kiln end-wise.\r\n    The bunks on which the lumber rests are channel steel. The\r\n    end sockets are malleable iron and made for I-beam stakes.]\r\n\r\nIn operation, the lumber is carried to these automatic stackers on\r\ntransfer chains or chain conveyors, and passes on to the stacker\r\ntable. When the table is covered with boards, the \"lumber\" lever is\r\npulled by the operator, which raises a stop, preventing any more\r\nlumber leaving the chain conveyor. The \"table\" lever then operates the\r\nfriction drive and raises the table filled with the boards to a\r\nvertical position. As the table goes up, it raises the latches, which\r\nfall into place behind the piling strips that had been previously laid\r\non the table. When the table returns to the lower position, a new set\r\nof piling strips are put in place on the table, and the stream of\r\nboards which has been accumulating on the conveyor chain are again\r\npermitted to flow onto the table. As each layer of lumber is added,\r\nthe kiln car is forced out against a strong tension. When the car is\r\nloaded, binders are put on over the stakes by means of a powerful\r\nlever arrangement.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 42. The above illustration shows the\r\n    construction of the Automatic Lumber Stacker for edge piling\r\n    of lumber to go into the dry kiln end-wise.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 43. The above illustration shows the\r\n    construction of the Automatic Lumber Stacker for edge piling\r\n    of lumber to go into the dry kiln cross-wise.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 44. The above illustration shows a\r\n    battery of Three Automatic Lumber Stackers.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 45. The above illustration shows another\r\n    battery of Three Automatic Lumber Stackers.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 46. Cars Loaded with Lumber on its Edges\r\n    by the Automatic Lumber Stackers.]\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the dry kilns, the loaded car is transferred to the\r\nunstacker (see Fig. 47). Here it is placed on the unstacker car which,\r\nby means of a tension device, holds the load of lumber tight against\r\nthe vertical frame of the unstacker. The frame of the unstacker is\r\ntriangular and has a series of chains. Each chain has two special\r\nlinks with projecting lugs. The chains all travel in unison. The lug\r\nlinks engage a layer of boards, sliding the entire layer vertically,\r\nand the boards, one at a time, fall over the top of the unstacker\r\nframe onto the inclined table, and from there onto conveyor chains\r\nfrom which they may be delivered to any point desired, depending upon\r\nthe length and direction of the chain conveyor.\r\n\r\nWith these unstackers one man can easily unload a kiln car in twenty\r\nminutes or less.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 47. The Lumber Unstacker Car, used for\r\n    unloading cars of Lumber loaded by the Automatic Stacker.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 48. The Lumber Unstacker Car and\r\n    Unstacker, used for unloading Lumber loaded by the Automatic\r\n    Stacker.]\r\n\r\nThe experience of many users prove that these edge stacking machines\r\nare not alike. This is important, because there is one feature of edge\r\nstacking that must not be overlooked. Unless each layer of boards is\r\nforced into place by power and held under a strong pressure, much\r\nslack will accumulate in an entire load, and the subsequent handling\r\nof the kiln cars, and the effect of the kiln-drying will loosen up the\r\nload until there is a tendency for the layers to telescope. And unless\r\nthe boards are held in place rigidly and with strong pressure they\r\nwill have a tendency to warp.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 49. The above illustration shows method\r\n    of loading kiln cars with veneer on its edges by the use of\r\n    the Tilting Platform.]\r\n\r\nA kiln car of edge-stacked lumber, properly piled, is made up of\r\nalternate solid sheets of lumber and vertical open-air spaces, so that\r\nthe hot air and vapors rise naturally and freely through the lumber,\r\ndrying both sides of the board evenly. The distribution of the heat\r\nand moisture being even and uniform, the drying process is naturally\r\nquickened, and there is no opportunity or tendency for the lumber to\r\nwarp.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 49 will be seen a method of loading kiln cars with veneer on\r\nedge by the use of a tilting platform. On the right of the\r\nillustration is seen a partially loaded kiln car tilted to an angle of\r\n45 degrees, to facilitate the placing of the veneer on the car. At\r\nthe left is a completely loaded car ready to enter the dry kiln.\r\n\r\nGum, poplar, and pine veneers are satisfactorily dried in this manner\r\nin from 8 to 24 hours.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 50 will be seen method of piling lumber on the flat,\r\n\"cross-wise\" of the dry kiln when same has three tracks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 50.

This makes a comparatively light\r\nand inexpensive door, and one that absolutely holds the heat. These\r\ndoors may be built either swinging, hoisting, or sliding.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 85.

The United States Forest Service\r\n    Humidity Diagram for determination of Absolute Humidities.\r\n    Dew Points and Vapor Pressures; also Relative Humidities by\r\n    means of Wet and Dry-Bulb Thermometer, for any temperatures\r\n    and change in temperature.]\r\n\r\nSome simple means of determining humidities and changes in humidity\r\nbrought about by changes in temperature in the dry kiln without the\r\nuse of tables is almost a necessity. To meet this requirement the\r\nUnited States Forestry Service has devised the Humidity Diagram shown\r\nin Figure 93. It differs in several respects from the hydrodeiks now\r\nin use.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the humidity diagram is to enable the dry-kiln operator\r\nto determine quickly the humidity conditions and vapor pressure, as\r\nwell as the changes which take place with changes of temperature. The\r\ndiagram above is adapted to the direct solution of problems of this\r\ncharacter without recourse to tables or mathematical calculations.\r\n\r\nThe humidity diagram consists of two distinct sets of curves on the\r\nsame sheet. One set, the convex curves, is for the determination of\r\nrelative humidity of wet-and-dry-bulb hygrometer or psychrometer; the\r\nother, the concave curves, is derived from the vapor pressures and\r\nshows the amount of moisture per cubic foot at relative humidities and\r\ntemperatures when read at the dew-point. The latter curves, therefore,\r\nare independent of all variables affecting the wet-bulb readings. They\r\nare proportional to vapor pressures, not to density, and, therefore,\r\nmay be followed from one temperature to another with correctness. The\r\nshort dashes show the correction (increase or decrease) which is\r\nnecessary in the relative humidity, read from the convex curves, with\r\nan increase or decrease from the normal barometric pressure of 30\r\ninches, for which the curves have been plotted. This correction,\r\nexcept for very low temperatures, is so small that it may usually be\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nThe ordinates, or vertical distances, are relative humidity expressed\r\nin per cent of saturation, from 0 per cent at the bottom to 100 per\r\ncent at the top. The abscissae, or horizontal distances, are\r\ntemperatures in degrees Fahrenheit from 30 degrees below zero, at the\r\nleft, to 220 degrees above, at the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Examples of Use\r\n\r\nThe application of the humidity diagram can best be understood by\r\nsample problems. These problems also show the wide range of conditions\r\nto which the diagram will apply.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 1. To find the relative humidity by use of\r\n     wet-and-dry-bulb hygrometer or psychrometer:\r\n\r\n     Place the instrument in a strong circulation of air, or wave\r\n     it to and fro. Read the temperature of the dry bulb and the\r\n     wet, and subtract. Find on the horizontal line the\r\n     temperature shown by the dry-bulb thermometer. Follow the\r\n     vertical line from this point till it intersects with the\r\n     convex curve marked with the difference between the wet and\r\n     dry readings. The horizontal line passing through this\r\n     intersection will give the relative humidity.\r\n\r\n     Example: Dry bulb 70°, wet bulb 62°, difference 8°. Find 70°\r\n     on the horizontal line of temperature. Follow up the\r\n     vertical line from 70° until it intersects with the convex\r\n     curve marked 8°. The horizontal line passing through this\r\n     intersection shows the relative humidity to be 64 per cent.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 2. To find how much water per cubic foot is\r\n     contained in the air:\r\n\r\n     Find the relative humidity as in example 1. Then the nearest\r\n     concave curve gives the weight of water in grains per cubic\r\n     foot when the air is cooled to the dew-point. Using the same\r\n     quantities as in example 1, this will be slightly more than\r\n     5 grains.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 3. To find the amount of water required to saturate\r\n     air at a given temperature:\r\n\r\n     Find on the top line (100 per cent humidity) the given\r\n     temperature; the concave curve intersecting at or near this\r\n     point gives the number of grains per cubic foot.\r\n     (Interpolate, if great accuracy is desired.)\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 4. To find the dew-point:\r\n\r\n     Obtain the relative humidity as in example 1. Then follow up\r\n     parallel to the nearest concave curve until the top\r\n     horizontal (indicating 100 per cent relative humidity) is\r\n     reached. The temperature on this horizontal line at the\r\n     point reached will be the dew-point.\r\n\r\n     Example: Dry bulb 70°, wet bulb 62°. On the vertical line\r\n     for 70° find the intersection with the hygrometer (convex)\r\n     curve for 8°. This will be found at nearly 64 per cent\r\n     relative humidity. Then follow up parallel with the vapor\r\n     pressure (concave) curve marked 5 grains to its intersection\r\n     at the top of the chart with the 100 per cent humidity line.\r\n     This gives the dew-point as 57°.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 5. To find the change in the relative humidity\r\n     produced by a change in temperature:\r\n\r\n     Example: The air at 70° Fahr. is found to contain 64 per\r\n     cent humidity; what will be its relative humidity if heated\r\n     to 150° Fahr.? Starting from the intersection of the\r\n     designated humidity and temperature coordinates, follow the\r\n     vapor-pressure curve (concave) until it intersects the 150°\r\n     temperature ordinate. The horizontal line then reads 6 per\r\n     cent relative humidity. The same operation applies to\r\n     reductions in temperature. In the above example what is the\r\n     humidity at 60°? Following parallel to the same curve in the\r\n     opposite direction until it intersects the 60° ordinate\r\n     gives 90 per cent; at 57° it becomes 100 per cent, reaching\r\n     the dew-point.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 6. To find the amount of condensation produced by\r\n     lowering the temperature:\r\n\r\n     Example: At 150° the wet bulb reads 132°. How much water\r\n     would be condensed if the temperature were lowered to 70°?\r\n     The intersection of the hygrometer curve for 18° (150°-132°)\r\n     with temperature line for 150° shows a relative humidity of\r\n     60 per cent. The vapor-pressure curve (concave) followed up\r\n     to the 100 per cent relative humidity line shows 45 grains\r\n     per cubic foot at the dew-point, which corresponds to a\r\n     temperature of 130°. At 70° it is seen that the air can\r\n     contain but 8 grains per cubic foot (saturation).\r\n     Consequently, there will be condensed 45 minus 8, or 37\r\n     grains per cubic foot of space measured at the dew-point.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 7. To find the amount of water required to produce\r\n     saturation by a given rise in temperature:\r\n\r\n     Example: Take the values given in example 5. The air at the\r\n     dew-point contains slightly over 5 grains per cubic foot. At\r\n     150° it is capable of containing 73 grains per cubic foot.\r\n     Consequently, 73-5=68 grains of water which can be\r\n     evaporated per cubic foot of space at the dew-point when the\r\n     temperature is raised to 150°. But the latent heat necessary\r\n     to produce evaporation must be supplied in addition to the\r\n     heat required to raise the air to 150°.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 8. To find the amount of water evaporated during a\r\n     given change of temperature and humidity:\r\n\r\n     Example: At 70° suppose the humidity is found to be 64 per\r\n     cent and at 150° it is found to be 60 per cent. How much\r\n     water has been evaporated per cubic foot of space? At 70°\r\n     temperature and 64 per cent humidity there are 5 grains of\r\n     water present per cubic foot at the dew-point (example 2).\r\n     At 150° and 60 per cent humidity there are 45 grains\r\n     present. Therefore, 45-5=40 grains of water which have been\r\n     evaporated per cubic foot of space, figuring all volumes at\r\n     the dew-point.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 9. To correct readings of the hygrometer for changes\r\n     in barometric pressure:\r\n\r\n     A change of pressure affects the reading of the wet bulb.\r\n     The chart applies at a barometric pressure of 30 inches,\r\n     and, except for great accuracy, no correction is generally\r\n     necessary.\r\n\r\n     Find the relative humidity as usual. Then look for the\r\n     nearest barometer line (indicated by dashes). At the end of\r\n     each barometer line will be found a fraction which\r\n     represents the proportion of the relative humidity already\r\n     found, which must be added or subtracted for a change in\r\n     barometric pressure. If the barometer reading is less than\r\n     30 inches, add; if greater than 30 inches, subtract. The\r\n     figures given are for a change of 1 inch; for other changes\r\n     use proportional amounts. Thus, for a change of 2 inches use\r\n     twice the indicated ratio; for half an inch use half, and so\r\n     on.\r\n\r\n     Example: Dry bulb 67°, wet bulb 51°, barometer 28 inches.\r\n     The relative humidity is found, by the method given in\r\n     example 1, to equal 30 per cent. The barometric line--gives\r\n     a value of 3/100H for each inch of change. Since the\r\n     barometer is 2 inches below 30, multiply 3/100H by 2, giving\r\n     6/100H. The correction will, therefore, be 6/100 of 30,\r\n     which equals 1.8. Since the barometer is below 30, this is\r\n     to be added, giving a corrected relative humidity of 31.8\r\n     per cent.\r\n\r\n     This has nothing to do with the vapor pressure (concave)\r\n     curves, which are independent of barometric pressure, and\r\n     consequently does not affect the solution of the previous\r\n     problems.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 10. At what temperature must the condenser be\r\n     maintained to produce a given humidity?\r\n\r\n     Example: Suppose the temperature in the drying room is to be\r\n     kept at 150° Fahr., and a humidity of 80 per cent is\r\n     desired. If the humidity is in excess of 80 per cent the air\r\n     must be cooled to the dew-point corresponding to this\r\n     condition (see example 4), which in this case is 141.5°.\r\n\r\n     Hence, if the condenser cools the air to this dew point the\r\n     required condition is obtained when the air is again heated\r\n     to the initial temperature.\r\n\r\n     EXAMPLE 11. Determination of relative humidity by the\r\n     dew-point:\r\n\r\n     The quantity of moisture present and relative humidity for\r\n     any given temperature may be determined directly and\r\n     accurately by finding the dew-point and applying the concave\r\n     (vapor-pressure) curves. This does away with the necessity\r\n     for the empirical convex curves and wet-and-dry-bulb\r\n     readings. To find the dew-point some form of apparatus,\r\n     consisting essentially of a thin glass vessel containing a\r\n     thermometer and a volatile liquid, such as ether, may be\r\n     used. The vessel is gradually cooled through the evaporation\r\n     of the liquid, accelerated by forcing air through a tube\r\n     until a haze or dimness, due to condensation from the\r\n     surrounding air, first appears upon the brighter outer\r\n     surface of the glass. The temperature at which the haze\r\n     first appears is the dew-point. Several trials should be\r\n     made for this temperature determination, using the average\r\n     temperature at which the haze appears and disappears.\r\n\r\n     To determine the relative humidity of the surrounding air by\r\n     means of the dew-point thus determined, find the concave\r\n     curve intersecting the top horizontal (100 per cent\r\n     relative humidity) line nearest the dew-point temperature.\r\n     Follow parallel with this curve till it intersects the\r\n     vertical line representing the temperature of the\r\n     surrounding air. The horizontal line passing through this\r\n     intersection will give the relative humidity.\r\n\r\n     Example: Temperature of surrounding air is 80; dew-point is\r\n     61; relative humidity is 53 per cent.\r\n\r\n     The dew-point determination is, however, not as convenient\r\n     to make as the wet-and-dry-bulb hygrometer readings.\r\n     Therefore, the hygrometer (convex) curves are ordinarily\r\n     more useful in determining relative humidities.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Hygrodeik\r\n\r\nIn Figure 94 will be seen the Hygrodeik. This instrument is used to\r\ndetermine the amount of moisture in the atmosphere. It is a very\r\nuseful instrument, as the readings may be taken direct with accuracy.\r\n\r\nTo find the relative humidity in the atmosphere, swing the index hand\r\nto the left of the chart, and adjust the sliding pointer to that\r\ndegree of the wet-bulb thermometer scale at which the mercury stands.\r\nThen swing the index hand to the right until the sliding pointer\r\nintersects the curved line, which extends downwards to the left from\r\nthe degree of the dry-bulb thermometer scale, indicated by the top of\r\nthe mercury column in the dry-bulb tube.\r\n\r\nAt that intersection, the index hand will point to the relative\r\nhumidity on scale at bottom of chart (for example see Fig. 94). Should\r\nthe temperature indicated by the wet-bulb thermometer be 60 degrees,\r\nand that of the dry-bulb 70 degrees, the index hand will indicate\r\nhumidity 55 degrees, when the pointer rests on the intersecting line\r\nof 60 degrees and 80 degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Recording Hygrometer\r\n\r\nIn Figure 95 is shown the Recording Hygrometer complete with wet and\r\ndry bulbs, two connecting tubes and two recording pens and special\r\nmoistening device for supplying water to the wet bulb.\r\n\r\nThis equipment is designed particularly for use in connection with dry\r\nrooms and dry kilns and is arranged so that the recording instrument\r\nand the water supply bottle may be installed outside of the dry kiln\r\nor drying room, while the wet and dry bulbs are both installed inside\r\nthe room or kiln at the point where it is desired to measure the\r\nhumidity. This instrument records on a weekly chart the humidity for\r\neach hour of the day, during the entire week.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 94. The Hygrodeik.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      The Registering Hygrometer\r\n\r\nIn Figure 96 is shown the Registering Hygrometer, which consists of\r\ntwo especially constructed thermometers. The special feature of the\r\nthermometers permits placing the instrument in the dry kiln without\r\nentering the drying room, through a small opening, where it is left\r\nfor about 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 95. The Recording Hygrometer, Complete\r\n    with Wet and Dry Bulbs. This instrument records on a weekly\r\n    chart the humidity for each hour of the day, during the\r\n    entire week.]\r\n\r\nThe temperature of both the dry and wet bulbs are automatically\r\nrecorded, and the outside temperature will not affect the thermometers\r\nwhen removed from the kiln. From these recorded temperatures, as shown\r\nwhen the instrument is removed from the kiln, the humidity can be\r\neasily determined from a simple form of chart which is furnished free\r\nby the makers with each instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Recording Thermometer\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 96. The Registering Hygrometer.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 97. The Recording Thermometer.]\r\n\r\nIn Figure 97 is shown the Recording Thermometer for observing and\r\nrecording the temperatures within a dry kiln, and thus obtaining a\r\ncheck upon its operation. This instrument is constructed to record\r\nautomatically, upon a circular chart, the temperatures prevailing\r\nwithin the drying room at all times of the day and night, and serves\r\nnot only as a means of keeping an accurate record of the operation of\r\nthe dry kiln, but as a valuable check upon the attendant in charge of\r\nthe drying process.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 98. The Registering Thermometer.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 99. The Recording Steam-Pressure Gauge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      The Registering Thermometer\r\n\r\nIn Figure 98 is shown the Registering Thermometer, which is a less\r\nexpensive instrument than that shown in Figure 97, but by its use the\r\nmaximum and minimum temperatures in the drying room during a given\r\nperiod can be determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Recording Steam Gauge\r\n\r\nIn Figure 99 is shown the Recording Steam Pressure Gauge, which is\r\nused for accurately recording the steam pressures kept in the boilers.\r\nThis instrument may be mounted near the boilers, or may be located at\r\nany distance necessary, giving a true and accurate record of the\r\nfluctuations of the steam pressure that may take place within the\r\nboilers, and is a check upon both the day and night boiler firemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Troemroid Scalometer\r\n\r\nIn Figure 100 is shown the Troemroid Scalometer. This instrument is a\r\nspecial scale of extreme accuracy, fitted with agate bearings with\r\nscrew adjustment for balancing. The beam is graduated from 0 to 2\r\nounces, divided into 100 parts, each division representing 1-50th of\r\nan ounce; and by using the pointer attached to the beam weight, the\r\n1-100th part of an ounce can be weighed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 100. The Troemroid Scalometer.]\r\n\r\nThe percentage table No. II has a range from one half of 1 per cent to\r\n30 per cent and is designed for use where extremely fine results are\r\nneeded, or where a very small amount of moisture is present. Table\r\nNo. III ranges from 30 per cent up to 90 per cent. These instruments\r\nare in three models as described below.\r\n\r\n     MODEL A. (One cylinder) ranges from 1/2 of 1 per cent to 30\r\n     per cent and is to be used for testing moisture contents in\r\n     kiln-dried and air-dried lumber.\r\n\r\n     MODEL B. (Two cylinders) ranges from 1/2 of 1 per cent up to\r\n     90 per cent and is to be used for testing the moisture\r\n     contents of kiln-dried, air-dried, and green lumber.\r\n\r\n     MODEL C. (One cylinder) ranges from 30 per cent to 90 per\r\n     cent and is applicable to green lumber only.\r\n\r\n=Test Samples.=--The green boards and all other boards intended for\r\ntesting should be selected from boards of fair average quality. If\r\nair-dried, select one about half way up the height of the pile of\r\nlumber. If kiln-dried, two thirds the height of the kiln car. Do not\r\nremove the kiln car from the kiln until after the test. Three of four\r\ntest pieces should be cut from near the middle of the cross-wise\r\nsection of the board, and 1/8 to 3/16 inch thick. Remove the\r\nsuperfluous sawdust and splinters. When the test pieces are placed on\r\nthe scale pan, be sure their weight is less than two ounces and more\r\nthan 1-3/4 ounces. If necessary, use two or more broken pieces. It is\r\nbetter if the test pieces can be cut off on a fine band saw.\r\n\r\n=Weighing.=--Set the base of the scale on a level surface and accurately\r\nbalance the scale beam. Put the test pieces on the scale pan and note\r\ntheir weight on the lower edge of the beam. Set the indicator point on\r\nthe horizontal bar at a number corresponding to this weight, which may\r\nbe found on the cylinder at the top of the table.\r\n\r\nDry the test pieces on the Electric Heater (Fig. 101) 30 to 40\r\nminutes, or on the engine cylinder two or three hours. Weigh them at\r\nonce and note the weight. Then turn the cylinder up and at the left of\r\nit under the small pointer find the number corresponding to this\r\nweight. The percentage of moisture lost is found directly under\r\npointer on the horizontal bar first mentioned. The lower portion on\r\nthe cylinder Table No. II is an extension of the upper portion, and\r\nis manipulated in the same manner except that the bottom line of\r\nfigures is used for the first weight, and the right side of cylinder\r\nfor second weight. Turn the cylinder down instead of up when using it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Examples (Test Pieces)\r\n\r\n     MODEL A. Table No. II, Kiln-dried or Air-dried Lumber:\r\n\r\n     If first weight is 90-1/2 and the second weight is 87, the\r\n     cylinder table will show the board from which the test\r\n     pieces were taken had a moisture content of 3.8 per cent.\r\n\r\n     MODEL B. Tables No. II and III, Air-dried (also Green and\r\n     Kiln-dried) Lumber.\r\n\r\n     If the first weight on lower cylinder is 97 and the second\r\n     weight is 76, the table will show 21.6 per cent of moisture.\r\n\r\n     MODEL C. Table III, Green Lumber:\r\n\r\n     If the first weight is 94 and the second weight is 51, the\r\n     table shows 45.8 per cent of moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Keep Records of the Moisture Content\r\n\r\n=Saw Mills.=--Should test and mark each pile of lumber when first piled\r\nin the yard, and later when sold it should be again tested and the two\r\nrecords given to the purchaser.\r\n\r\n=Factories.=--Should test and mark the lumber when first received, and\r\nif piled in the yard to be kiln-dried later, it should be tested\r\nbefore going into the dry kiln, and again before being removed, and\r\nthese records placed on file for future reference.\r\n\r\nKiln-dried lumber piled in storage rooms (without any heat) will\r\nabsorb 7 to 9 per cent of moisture, and even when so stored should be\r\ntested for moisture before being manufactured into the finished\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nNever work lumber through the factory that has more than 5 or 6 per\r\ncent of moisture or less than 3 per cent.\r\n\r\nDry storage rooms should be provided with heating coils and properly\r\nventilated.\r\n\r\nOak or any other species of wood that shows 25 or 30 per cent of\r\nmoisture when going into the dry kiln, will take longer to dry than it\r\nwould if it contained 15 to 20 per cent, therefore the importance of\r\ntesting before putting into the kiln as well as when taking it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Electric Heater\r\n\r\nIn Figure 101 is shown the Electric Heater. This heater is especially\r\ndesigned to dry quickly the test pieces for use in connection with the\r\nScalometer (see Fig. 100) without charring them. It may be attached to\r\nany electric light socket of 110 volts direct or alternating current.\r\nA metal rack is provided to hold the test pieces vertically on edge.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 101. The Electric Heater.]\r\n\r\nTurn the test pieces over once or twice while drying.\r\n\r\nIt will require from 20 minutes to one hour to remove all the moisture\r\nfrom the test pieces when placed on this heater, depending on whether\r\nthey are cut from green, air-dried, or kiln-dried boards.\r\n\r\nTest pieces cut from softwoods will dry quicker than those cut from\r\nhardwoods.\r\n\r\nWhen the test pieces fail to show any further loss in weight, they are\r\nthen free from all moisture content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN BLOWER COMPANY, Detroit, Mich.\r\n\r\nIMRE, JAMES E., \"The Kiln-drying of Gum,\" The United States\r\nDept. of Agriculture, Division of Forestry.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL DRY KILN COMPANY, Indianapolis, Ind.\r\n\r\nPRICHARD, REUBEN P., \"The Structure of the Common Woods,\"\r\nThe United States Dept. of Agriculture, Division of Forestry,\r\nBulletin No. 3.\r\n\r\nROTH, FILIBERT, \"Timber,\" The United States Dept. of Agriculture,\r\nDivision of Forestry, Bulletin No. 10.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD DRY KILN COMPANY, Indianapolis, Ind.\r\n\r\nSTURTEVANT COMPANY, B.
