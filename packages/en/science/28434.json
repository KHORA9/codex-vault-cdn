Though conscious of his\r\ninability to do justice to the sublimest of poets and the noblest of\r\nsciences, the author has ventured to contribute to Miltonic literature a\r\nwork which he hopes will prove to be of an interesting and instructive\r\ncharacter. Perhaps the choicest passages in the poem are associated with\r\nastronomical allusion, and it is chiefly to the exposition and\r\nillustration of these that this volume is devoted.\r\n\r\nThe writer is indebted to many authors for information and reference,\r\nand especially to Miss Agnes M. Clerke, Professors Masson and Young, Mr.\r\nJames Nasmyth, Mr. G. F. Chambers, and Sir Robert Ball. Also to the\r\nworks of the late Mr. R. A. Proctor, Sirs W. and J.

To a\r\ncontemplative observer of the heavens, the number and brilliancy of the\r\nstars, the lustre of the planets, the silvery aspect of the Moon, with\r\nher ever-changing phases, together with the order, the harmony, and\r\nunison pervading them all, create in his mind thoughts of wonder and\r\nadmiration. Occupying the abyss of space indistinguishable from\r\ninfinity, the starry heavens in grandeur and magnificence surpass the\r\nloftiest conceptions of the human mind; for, at a distance beyond the\r\nrange of ordinary vision, the telescope reveals clusters, systems,\r\ngalaxies, universes of stars--suns--the innumerable host of heaven, each\r\nshining with a splendour comparable with that of our Sun, and, in all\r\nlikelihood, fulfilling in a similar manner the same beneficent purposes.\r\n\r\nThe time when man began to study the stars is lost in the antiquity of\r\nprehistoric ages. The ancient inhabitants of the Earth regarded the\r\nheavenly bodies with veneration and awe, erected temples in their\r\nhonour, and worshipped them as deities. Historical records of astronomy\r\ncarry us back several thousand years. During the greater part of this\r\ntime, and until a comparatively recent period, astronomy was associated\r\nwith astrology--a science which originated from a desire on the part of\r\nmankind to penetrate the future, and which was based upon the supposed\r\ninfluence of the heavenly bodies upon human and terrestrial affairs. It\r\nwas natural to imagine that the overruling power which governed and\r\ndirected the course of sublunary events resided in the heavens, and that\r\nits decrees might be understood by watching the movements of the\r\nheavenly bodies under its control. It was, therefore, believed that by\r\nobserving the configuration of the planets and the positions of the\r\nconstellations at the instant of the birth of an individual, his\r\nhoroscope, or destiny, could be foretold; and that by making\r\nobservations of a somewhat similar nature the occurrence of events of\r\npublic importance could be predicted. When, however, the laws which\r\ngovern the motions of the heavenly bodies became better known, and\r\nespecially after the discovery of the great law of gravitation,\r\nastrology ceased to be a belief, though for long after it retained its\r\npower over the imagination, and was often alluded to in the writings of\r\npoets and other authors.\r\n\r\nIn the early dawn of astronomical science, the theories upheld with\r\nregard to the structure of the heavens were of a simple and primitive\r\nnature, and might even be described as grotesque. This need occasion no\r\nsurprise when we consider the difficulties with which ancient\r\nastronomers had to contend in their endeavours to reduce to order and\r\nharmony the complicated motions of the orbs which they beheld circling\r\naround them.\r\n\r\nThe grouping of the stars into constellations having fanciful names,\r\nderived from fable or ancient mythology, occurred at a very early\r\nperiod, and though devoid of any methodical arrangement, is yet\r\nsufficiently well-defined to serve the purposes of modern astronomers.\r\nSeveral of the ancient nations of the earth, including the Chaldeans,\r\nEgyptians, Hindus, and Chinese, claim to have been the earliest\r\nastronomers. Chinese records of astronomy reveal an antiquity of near\r\n3,000 years B.C., but they contain no evidence that their authors\r\npossessed any scientific knowledge, and they merely record the\r\noccurrence of solar eclipses and the appearances of comets.\r\n\r\nIt is not known when astronomy was first studied by the Egyptians; but\r\nwhat astronomical information they have handed down is not of a very\r\nintelligible kind, nor have they left behind any data that can be relied\r\nupon. The Great Pyramid, judging from the exactness with which it faces\r\nthe cardinal points, must have been designed by persons who possessed a\r\ngood knowledge of astronomy, and it was probably made use of for\r\nobservational purposes.\r\n\r\nIt is now generally admitted that correct astronomical observations were\r\nfirst made on the plains of Chaldea, records of eclipses having been\r\ndiscovered in Chaldean cities which date back 2,234 years B.C. The\r\nChaldeans were true astronomers: they made correct observations of the\r\nrisings and settings of the heavenly bodies; and the exact orientation\r\nof their temples and public buildings indicates the precision with which\r\nthey observed the positions of celestial objects. They invented the\r\nzodiac and gnomon, made use of several kinds of dials, notified\r\neclipses, and divided the day into twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nTo the Greeks belongs the credit of having first studied astronomy in a\r\nregular and systematic manner. THALES (640 B.C.) was one of the earliest\r\nof Greek astronomers, and may be regarded as the founder of the science\r\namong that people. He was born at Miletus, and afterwards repaired to\r\nEgypt for the purpose of study. On his return to Greece he founded the\r\nIonian school, and taught the sphericity of the Earth, the obliquity of\r\nthe ecliptic, and the true causes of eclipses of the Sun and Moon. He\r\nalso directed the attention of mariners to the superiority of the Lesser\r\nBear, as a guide for the navigation of vessels, as compared with the\r\nGreat Bear, by which constellation they usually steered. Thales believed\r\nthe Earth to be the centre of the universe, and that the stars were\r\ncomposed of fire; he also predicted the occurrence of a great solar\r\neclipse.\r\n\r\nThales had for his successors Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Anaxagoras,\r\nwho taught the doctrines of the Ionian school.\r\n\r\nThe next great astronomer that we read of is PYTHAGORAS, who was born at\r\nSamos 590 B.C. He studied under Thales, and afterwards visited Egypt and\r\nIndia, in order that he might make himself familiar with the scientific\r\ntheories adopted by those nations. On his return to Europe he founded\r\nhis school in Italy, and taught in a more extended form the doctrines of\r\nthe Ionian school. In his speculations with regard to the structure of\r\nthe universe he propounded the theory (though the reasons by which he\r\nsustained it were fanciful) that the Sun is the centre of the planetary\r\nsystem, and that the Earth revolves round him. This theory--the accuracy\r\nof which has since been confirmed--received but little attention from\r\nhis successors, and it sank into oblivion until the time of Copernicus,\r\nby whom it was revived. Pythagoras discovered that the Morning and\r\nEvening Stars are one and the same planet.\r\n\r\nAmong the famous astronomers who lived about this period we find\r\nrecorded the names of Meton, who introduced the Metonic cycle into\r\nGreece and erected the first sundial at Athens; Eudoxus, who persuaded\r\nthe Greeks to adopt the year of 365-1/4 days; and Nicetas, who taught\r\nthat the Earth completed a daily revolution on her axis.\r\n\r\nThe Alexandrian school, which flourished for three centuries prior to\r\nthe Christian era, produced men of eminence whose discoveries and\r\ninvestigations, when arranged and classified, enabled astronomy to be\r\nregarded as a true theoretical science. The positions of the fixed stars\r\nand the paths of the planets were determined with greater accuracy, and\r\nirregularities of the motions of the Sun and Moon were investigated with\r\ngreater precision. Attempts were made to ascertain the distance of the\r\nSun from the Earth, and also the dimensions of the terrestrial sphere.\r\nThe obliquity of the ecliptic was accurately determined, and an arc of\r\nthe meridian was measured between Syene and Alexandria. The names of\r\nAristarchus, Eratosthenes, Aristyllus, Timocharis, and Autolycus, are\r\nfamiliarly known in association with the advancement of the astronomy of\r\nthis period.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the name of HIPPARCHUS of Bithynia (140 B.C.), the most\r\nillustrious astronomer of antiquity, who did much to raise astronomy to\r\nthe position of a true science, and who has also left behind him ample\r\nevidence of his genius 'as a mathematician, an observer, and a\r\ntheorist.' We are indebted to him for the earliest star catalogue, in\r\nwhich he included 1,081 stars. He discovered the Precession of the\r\nEquinoxes, and determined the motions of the Sun and Moon, and also the\r\nlength of the year, with greater precision than any of his predecessors.\r\nHe invented the sciences of plane and spherical trigonometry, and was\r\nthe first to use right ascensions and declinations.\r\n\r\nThe next astronomer of eminence after Hipparchus was PTOLEMY (130 A.D.),\r\nwho resided at Alexandria. He was skilled as a mathematician and\r\ngeographer, and also excelled as a musician. His chief discovery was an\r\nirregularity of the lunar motion, called the '_evection_.' He was also\r\nthe first to observe the effect of the refraction of light in causing\r\nthe apparent displacement of a heavenly body from its true position.\r\nPtolemy devoted much of his time to extending and improving the theories\r\nof Hipparchus, and compiled a great treatise, called the 'Almagest,'\r\nwhich contains nearly all the knowledge we possess of ancient astronomy.\r\nPtolemy's name is, however, most widely known in association with what\r\nis called the Ptolemaic theory. This system, which originated long\r\nbefore his time, but of which he was one of the ablest expounders, was\r\nan attempt to establish on a scientific basis the conclusions and\r\nresults arrived at by early astronomers who studied and observed the\r\nmotions of the heavenly bodies. Ptolemy regarded the Earth as the\r\nimmovable centre of the universe, round which the Sun, Moon, planets,\r\nand the entire heavens completed a daily revolution in twenty-four\r\nhours. After the death of Ptolemy no worthy successor was found to\r\noccupy his place, the study of astronomy began to decline among the\r\nGreeks, and after a time it ceased to be cultivated by that people.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs next took up the study of astronomy, which they prosecuted\r\nmost assiduously for a period of four centuries. Their labours were,\r\nhowever, confined chiefly to observational work, in which they\r\nexcelled; unlike their predecessors, they paid but little attention to\r\nspeculative theories--indeed, they regarded with such veneration the\r\nopinions held by the Greeks, that they did not feel disposed to question\r\nthe accuracy of their doctrines. The most eminent astronomer among the\r\nArabs was ALBATEGNIUS (680 A.D.). He corrected the Greek observations,\r\nand made several discoveries which testified to his abilities as an\r\nobserver. IBN YUNIS and ABUL WEFU were Arab astronomers who earned a\r\nhigh reputation on account of the number and accuracy of their\r\nobservations. In Persia, a descendant of the famous Genghis Khan erected\r\nan observatory, where astronomical observations were systematically\r\nmade. Omar, a Persian astronomer, suggested a reformation of the\r\ncalendar which, if it had been adopted, would have insured greater\r\naccuracy than can be attained by the Gregorian style now in use. In\r\n1433, Ulugh Beg, who resided at Samarcand, made many observations, and\r\nconstructed a star catalogue of greater exactness than was known to\r\nexist prior to his time. The Arabs may be regarded as having been the\r\ncustodians of astronomy until the time of its revival in another quarter\r\nof the Globe.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of many centuries, astronomy was introduced into Western\r\nEurope in 1220, and from that date to the present time its career has\r\nbeen one of triumphant progress. In 1230, a translation of Ptolemy's\r\n'Almagest' from Arabic into Latin was accomplished by order of the\r\nGerman Emperor, Frederick II.; and in 1252 Alphonso X., King of Castile,\r\nhimself a zealous patron of astronomy, caused a new set of astronomical\r\ntables to be constructed at his own expense, which, in honour of his\r\nMajesty, were called the 'Alphonsine Tables.' Purbach and Regiomontanus,\r\ntwo German astronomers of distinguished reputation, and Waltherus, a man\r\nof considerable renown, made many important observations in the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent astronomer who lived during the latter part of this\r\ncentury was Copernicus. NICOLAS COPERNICUS was born February 19, 1473,\r\nat Thorn, a small town situated on the Vistula, which formed the\r\nboundary between the kingdoms of Prussia and Poland. His father was a\r\nPolish subject, and his mother of German extraction. Having lost his\r\nparents early in life, he was educated under the supervision of his\r\nuncle Lucas, Bishop of Ermland. Copernicus attended a school at Thorn,\r\nand afterwards entered the University of Cracow, in 1491, where he\r\ndevoted four years to the study of mathematics and science. On leaving\r\nCracow he attached himself to the University of Bologna as a student of\r\ncanon law, and attended a course of lectures on astronomy given by\r\nNovarra. In the ensuing year he was appointed canon of Frauenburg, the\r\ncathedral city of the Diocese of Ermland, situated on the shores of the\r\nFrisches Haff. In the year 1500 he was at Rome, where he lectured on\r\nmathematics and astronomy. He next spent a few years at the University\r\nof Padua, where, besides applying himself to mathematics and astronomy,\r\nhe studied medicine and obtained a degree. In 1505 Copernicus returned\r\nto his native country, and was appointed medical attendant to his uncle,\r\nthe Bishop of Ermland, with whom he resided in the stately castle of\r\nHeilsberg, situated at a distance of forty-six miles from Frauenburg.\r\nCopernicus lived with his uncle from 1507 till 1512, and during that\r\ntime prosecuted his astronomical studies, and undertook, besides, many\r\narduous duties associated with the administration of the diocese; these\r\nhe faithfully discharged until the death of the Bishop, which occurred\r\nin 1512. After the death of his uncle he took up his residence at\r\nFrauenburg, where he occupied his time in meditating on his new\r\nastronomy and undertaking various duties of a public character, which he\r\nfulfilled with credit and distinction. In 1523 he was appointed\r\nAdministrator-General of the diocese. Though a canon of Frauenburg,\r\nCopernicus never became a priest.\r\n\r\nAfter many years of profound meditation and thought, Copernicus, in a\r\ntreatise entitled 'De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium,' propounded a new\r\ntheory, or, more correctly speaking, revived the ancient Pythagorean\r\nsystem of the universe. This great work, which he dedicated to Pope Paul\r\nIII., was completed in 1530; but he could not be prevailed upon to have\r\nit published until 1543, the year in which he died. In 1542 Copernicus\r\nhad an apoplectic seizure, followed by paralysis and a gradual decay of\r\nhis mental and vital powers. His book was printed at Nuremberg, and the\r\nfirst copy arrived at Frauenburg on May 24, 1543, in time to be touched\r\nby the hands of the dying man, who in a few hours after expired. The\r\nhouse in which Copernicus lived at Allenstein is still in existence, and\r\nin the walls of his chamber are visible the perforations which he made\r\nfor the purpose of observing the stars cross the meridian.\r\n\r\nCopernicus was the means of creating an entire revolution in the science\r\nof astronomy, by transferring the centre of our system from the Earth to\r\nthe Sun. He accounted for the alternation of day and night by the\r\nrotation of the Earth on her axis, and for the vicissitudes of the\r\nseasons by her revolution round the Sun. He devoted the greater part of\r\nhis life to meditating on this theory, and adduced several weighty\r\nreasons in its support. Copernicus could not help perceiving the\r\ncomplications and entanglements by which the Ptolemaic system of the\r\nuniverse was surrounded, and which compared unfavourably with the simple\r\nand orderly manner in which other natural phenomena presented themselves\r\nto his observation. By perceiving that Mars when in opposition was not\r\nmuch inferior in lustre to Jupiter, and when in conjunction resembled a\r\nstar of the second magnitude, he arrived at the conclusion that the\r\nEarth could not be the centre of the planet's motion. Having discovered\r\nin some ancient manuscripts a theory, ascribed to the Egyptians, that\r\nMercury and Venus revolved round the Sun, whilst they accompanied the\r\norb in his revolution round the Earth, Copernicus was able to perceive\r\nthat this afforded him a means of explaining the alternate appearance of\r\nthose planets on each side of the Sun. The varied aspects of the\r\nsuperior planets, when observed in different parts of their orbits, also\r\nled him to conclude that the Earth was not the central body round which\r\nthey accomplished their revolutions. As a combined result of his\r\nobservation and reasoning Copernicus propounded the theory that the Sun\r\nis the centre of our system, and that all the planets, including the\r\nEarth, revolve in orbits around him. This, which is called the\r\nCopernican system, is now regarded as, and has been proved to be, the\r\ntrue theory of the solar system.\r\n\r\nTYCHO BRAHE was a celebrated Danish astronomer, who earned a deservedly\r\nhigh reputation on account of the number and accuracy of his\r\nastronomical observations and calculations. The various astronomical\r\ntables that were in use in his time contained many inaccuracies, and it\r\nbecame necessary that they should be reconstructed upon a more correct\r\nbasis. Tycho possessed the practical skill required for this kind of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nHe was born December 14, 1546, at Knudstorp, near Helsingborg. His\r\nfather, Otto Brahe, traced his descent from a Swedish family of noble\r\nbirth. At the age of thirteen Tycho was sent to the University of\r\nCopenhagen, where it was intended he should prepare himself for the\r\nstudy of the law.\r\n\r\nThe prediction of a great solar eclipse, which was to happen on August\r\n21, 1560, caused much public excitement in Denmark, for in those days\r\nsuch phenomena were regarded as portending the occurrence of events of\r\nnational importance. Tycho looked forward with great eagerness to the\r\ntime of the eclipse. He watched its progress with intense interest, and\r\nwhen he perceived all the details of the phenomenon occur exactly as\r\nthey were predicted, he resolved to pursue the study of a science by\r\nwhich, as was then believed, the occurrence of future events could be\r\nforetold. From Copenhagen Tycho Brahe was sent to Leipsic to study\r\njurisprudence, but astronomy absorbed all his thoughts. He spent his\r\npocket-money in purchasing astronomical books, and, when his tutor had\r\nretired to sleep, he occupied his time night after night in watching the\r\nstars and making himself familiar with their courses. He followed the\r\nplanets in their direct and retrograde movements, and with the aid of a\r\nsmall globe and pair of compasses was able by means of his own\r\ncalculations to detect serious discrepancies in the Alphonsine and\r\nPrutenic tables. In order to make himself more proficient in calculating\r\nastronomical tables he studied arithmetic and geometry, and learned\r\nmathematics without the aid of a master. Having remained at Leipsic for\r\nthree years, during which time he paid far more attention to the study\r\nof astronomy than to that of law, he returned to his native country in\r\nconsequence of the death of an uncle, who bequeathed him a considerable\r\nestate. In Denmark he continued to prosecute his astronomical studies,\r\nand incurred the displeasure of his friends, who blamed him for\r\nneglecting his intended profession and wasting his time on astronomy,\r\nwhich they regarded as useless and unprofitable.\r\n\r\nNot caring to remain among his relatives, Tycho Brahe returned to\r\nGermany, and arrived at Wittenberg in 1566. Whilst residing here he had\r\nan altercation with a Danish gentleman over some question in\r\nmathematics. The quarrel led to a duel with swords, which terminated\r\nrather unfortunately for Tycho, who had a portion of his nose cut off.\r\nThis loss he repaired by ingeniously contriving one of gold, silver, and\r\nwax, which was said to bear a good resemblance to the original. From\r\nWittenberg Tycho proceeded to Augsburg, where he resided for two years.\r\nHere he made the acquaintance of several men distinguished for their\r\nlearning and their love of astronomy. During his stay at Augsburg he\r\nconstructed a quadrant of fourteen cubits radius, on which were\r\nindicated the single minutes of a degree; he made many valuable\r\nobservations with this instrument, which he used in combination with a\r\nlarge sextant.\r\n\r\nIn 1571 Tycho returned to Denmark, where his fame as an astronomer had\r\npreceded him, and was the means of procuring for him a hearty welcome\r\nfrom his relatives and friends. In 1572, when returning one night from\r\nhis laboratory--for Tycho studied alchemy as well as astronomy--he\r\nbeheld what appeared to be a new and brilliant star in the\r\nconstellation Cassiopeia, which was situated overhead. He directed the\r\nattention of his companions to this wonderful object, and all declared\r\nthat they had never observed such a star before. On the following night\r\nhe measured its distance from the nearest stars in the constellation,\r\nand arrived at the conclusion that it was a fixed star, and beyond our\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable object remained visible for sixteen months, and when at\r\nits brightest rivalled Sirius. At first it was of a brilliant white\r\ncolour, but as it diminished in size it became yellow; it next changed\r\nto a red colour, resembling Aldebaran; afterwards it appeared like\r\nSaturn, and as it grew smaller it decreased in brightness, until it\r\nfinally became invisible. In 1573 Tycho Brahe married a peasant-girl\r\nfrom the village of Knudstorp. This imprudent act roused the resentment\r\nof his relatives, who, being of noble birth, were indignant that he\r\nshould have contracted such an alliance. The bitterness and mutual\r\nill-feeling created by this affair became so intense that the King of\r\nDenmark deemed it advisable to endeavour to bring about a\r\nreconciliation.\r\n\r\nAfter this Tycho returned to Germany, and visited several cities before\r\ndeciding where he should take up his permanent residence.\r\n\r\nHis fame as an astronomer was now so great that he was received with\r\ndistinction wherever he went, and on the occasion of a visit to\r\nHesse-Cassel he spent a few pleasant days with William, Landgrave of\r\nHesse, who was himself skilled in astronomy.\r\n\r\nFrederick II., King of Denmark, having recognised Tycho Brahe's great\r\nmerits as an astronomer, and not wishing that his fame should add lustre\r\nto a foreign Court, expressed a desire that he should return to his\r\nnative country, and as an inducement offered him a life interest in the\r\nisland of Huen, in the Sound, where he undertook to erect and equip an\r\nobservatory at his own expense; the King also promised to bestow upon\r\nhim a pension, and grant him other emoluments besides.\r\n\r\nTycho gladly accepted this generous offer, and during the construction\r\nof the observatory occupied his time in making a magnificent collection\r\nof instruments and appliances adapted for observational purposes. This\r\nhandsome edifice, upon which the King of Denmark expended a sum of\r\n20,000_l._, was called 'Uranienburg' ('The Citadel of the Heavens').\r\nHere Tycho resided for a period of twenty years, during which time he\r\npursued his astronomical labours with untiring energy and zeal, and made\r\na large number of observations and calculations of much superior\r\naccuracy to any that existed previously, which were afterwards of great\r\nservice to his successors. During his long residence at Huen, Tycho was\r\nvisited by many distinguished persons, who were attracted to his island\r\nhome by his fame and the magnificence of his observatory. Among them was\r\nJames VI. of Scotland, who, whilst journeying to the Court of Denmark\r\non the occasion of his marriage to a Danish princess, paid Tycho a\r\nvisit, and enjoyed his hospitality for a week. The King was delighted\r\nwith all that he saw, and on his departure presented Tycho with a\r\nhandsome donation, and at his request composed some Latin verses, in\r\nwhich he eulogised his host and praised his observatory.\r\n\r\nThe island of Huen is situated about six miles from the coast of\r\nZealand, and fourteen from Copenhagen. It has a circumference of six\r\nmiles, and consists chiefly of an elevated plateau, in the centre of\r\nwhich Tycho erected his observatory, the site of which is now marked by\r\ntwo pits and a few mounds of earth--all that remains of Uranienburg. All\r\nwent well with Tycho Brahe during the lifetime of his noble patron; but\r\nin 1588 Frederick II. died, and was succeeded by his son, a youth eleven\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\nThe Danish nobles had long been jealous of Tycho's fame and reputation,\r\nand on the death of the King an opportunity was afforded them of\r\nintriguing with the object of accomplishing his downfall. Several false\r\naccusations were brought against him, and the Court party made the\r\nimpoverished state of the Treasury an excuse for depriving him of his\r\npension and emoluments granted by the late King.\r\n\r\nTycho was no longer able to bear the expense of maintaining his\r\nestablishment at Huen, and fearing that he might be deprived of the\r\nisland itself, he took a house in Copenhagen, to which he removed all\r\nhis smaller instruments.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence in the capital he was subjected to annoyance and\r\npersecution. An order was issued in the King's name preventing him from\r\ncarrying on his chemical experiments, and he besides suffered the\r\nindignity of a personal assault. Tycho Brahe resolved to quit his\r\nungrateful country and seek a home in some foreign land, where he should\r\nbe permitted to pursue his studies unmolested and live in quietness and\r\npeace. He accordingly removed from the island of Huen all his\r\ninstruments and appliances that were of a portable nature, and packed\r\nthem on board a vessel which he hired for the purpose of transport, and,\r\nhaving embarked with his family, his servants, and some of his pupils\r\nand assistants, 'this interesting barque, freighted with the glory of\r\nDenmark,' set sail from Copenhagen about the end of 1597, and having\r\ncrossed the Baltic in safety, arrived at Rostock, where Tycho found some\r\nold friends waiting to receive him. He was now in doubt as to where he\r\nshould find a home, when the Austrian Emperor Rudolph, himself a liberal\r\npatron of science and the fine arts, having heard of Tycho Brahe's\r\nmisfortunes, sent him an invitation to take up his abode in his\r\ndominions, and promised that he should be treated in a manner worthy of\r\nhis reputation and fame.\r\n\r\nTycho resolved to accept the Emperor's kind invitation, and in the\r\nspring of 1599 arrived at Prague, where he found a handsome residence\r\nprepared for his reception.\r\n\r\nHe was received by the Emperor in a most cordial manner and treated with\r\nthe greatest kindness. An annual pension of three thousand crowns was\r\nsettled upon him for life, and he was to have his choice of several\r\nresidences belonging to his Majesty, where he might reside and erect a\r\nnew observatory. From among these he selected the Castle of Benach, in\r\nBohemia, which was situated on an elevated plateau and commanded a wide\r\nview of the horizon.\r\n\r\nDuring his residence at Benach Tycho received a visit from Kepler, who\r\nstayed with him for several months in order that he might carry out some\r\nastronomical observations. In the following year Kepler returned, and\r\ntook up his permanent residence with Tycho, having been appointed\r\nassistant in his observatory, a post which, at Tycho's request, was\r\nconferred upon him by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe soon discovered that his ignorance of the language and\r\nunfamiliarity with the customs of the people caused him much\r\ninconvenience. He therefore asked permission from the Emperor to be\r\nallowed to remove to Prague. This request was readily granted, and a\r\nsuitable residence was provided for him in the city.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime his family, his large instruments, and other property,\r\nhaving arrived at Prague, Tycho was soon comfortably settled in his new\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThough Tycho Brahe continued his astronomical observations, yet he could\r\nnot help feeling that he lived among a strange people; nor did the\r\nremembrance of his sufferings and the cruel treatment he received at the\r\nhands of his fellow-countrymen subdue the affection which he cherished\r\ntowards his native land. Pondering over the past, he became despondent\r\nand low-spirited; a morbid imagination caused him to brood over small\r\ntroubles, and gloomy, melancholy thoughts possessed his mind--symptoms\r\nwhich seemed to presage the approach of some serious malady. One\r\nevening, when visiting at the house of a friend, he was seized with a\r\npainful illness, to which he succumbed in less than a fortnight. He died\r\nat Prague on October 24, 1601, when in his fifty-fifth year.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Rudolph, when informed of Tycho Brahe's death, expressed his\r\ndeep regret, and commanded that he should be interred in the principal\r\nchurch in the city, and that his obsequies should be celebrated with\r\nevery mark of honour and respect.\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe stands out as the most romantic and prominent figure in the\r\nhistory of astronomy. His independence of character, his ardent\r\nattachments, his strong hatreds, and his love of splendour, are\r\ncharacteristics which distinguish him from all other men of his age.\r\nThis remarkable man was an astronomer, astrologer, and alchemist; but in\r\nhis latter years he renounced astrology, and believed that the stars\r\nexercised no influence over the destinies of mankind.\r\n\r\nAs a practical astronomer, Tycho Brahe has not been excelled by any\r\nother observer of the heavens. The magnificence of his observatory at\r\nHuen, upon the equipment and embellishment of which it is stated he\r\nexpended a ton of gold; the splendour and variety of his instruments,\r\nand his ingenuity in inventing new ones, would alone have made him\r\nfamous. But it was by the skill and assiduity with which he carried out\r\nhis numerous and important observations that he has earned for himself a\r\nposition of the most honourable distinction among astronomers. In his\r\ninvestigation of the Lunar theory Tycho Brahe discovered the Moon's\r\n_annual equation_, a yearly effect produced by the Sun's disturbing\r\nforce as the Earth approaches or recedes from him in her orbit. He also\r\ndiscovered another inequality in the Moon's motion, called the\r\n_variation_. He determined with greater exactness astronomical\r\nrefractions from an altitude of 45 deg. downwards to the horizon, and\r\nconstructed a catalogue of 777 stars. He also made a vast number of\r\nobservations on planets, which formed the basis of the 'Rudolphine\r\nTables,' and were of invaluable assistance to Kepler in his\r\ninvestigation of the laws relating to planetary motion.\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe declined to accept the Copernican theory, and devised a\r\nsystem of his own, which he called the 'Tychonic.' By this arrangement\r\nthe Earth remained stationary, whilst all the planets revolved round\r\nthe Sun, who in his turn completed a daily revolution round the Earth.\r\nAll the phenomena associated with the motions of those bodies could be\r\nexplained by means of this system; but it did not receive much support,\r\nand after the Copernican theory became better understood it was given\r\nup, and heard of no more.\r\n\r\nWe now arrive at the name of KEPLER, one of the very greatest of\r\nastronomers, and a man of remarkable genius, who was the first to\r\ndiscover the real nature of the paths pursued by the Earth and planets\r\nin their revolution round the Sun. After seventeen years of close\r\nobservation, he announced that those bodies travelled round the Sun in\r\nelliptical or oval orbits, and not in circular paths, as was believed by\r\nCopernicus. In his investigation of the laws which govern the motions of\r\nthe planets he formulated those famous theorems known as 'Kepler's\r\nLaws,' which will endure for all time as a proof of his sagacity and\r\nsurpassing genius. Prior to the discovery of those laws the Sun, though\r\nacknowledged to be the centre of the system, did not appear to occupy a\r\ncentral position as regards the motions of the planets; but Kepler, by\r\ndemonstrating that the planes of the orbits of all the planets, and the\r\nlines connecting their apsides, passed through the Sun, was enabled to\r\nassign the orb his true position with regard to those bodies.\r\n\r\nJOHN KEPLER was born at Weil, in the Duchy of Wurtemberg, December 21,\r\n1571. His parents, though of noble family, lived in reduced\r\ncircumstances, owing to causes for which they were themselves chiefly\r\nresponsible. In his youth Kepler suffered so much from ill-health that\r\nhis education had to be neglected. In 1586 he was sent to a monastic\r\nschool at Maulbronn, which had been established at the Reformation, and\r\nwas under the patronage of the Duke of Wurtemberg. Afterwards he studied\r\nat the University of Tubingen, where he distinguished himself and took a\r\ndegree. Kepler devoted his attention chiefly to science and mathematics,\r\nbut paid no particular attention to the study of astronomy. Maestlin,\r\nthe professor of mathematics, whose lectures he attended, upheld the\r\nCopernican theory, and Kepler, who adopted the views of his teacher,\r\nwrote an essay in favour of the diurnal rotation of the Earth, in which\r\nhe supported the more recent astronomical doctrines. In 1594, a vacancy\r\nhaving occurred in the professorship of astronomy at Gratz consequent\r\nupon the death of George Stadt, Kepler was appointed his successor. He\r\ndid not seek this office, as he felt no particular desire to take up the\r\nstudy of astronomy, but was recommended by his tutors as a man well\r\nfitted for the post. He was thus in a manner compelled to devote his\r\ntime and talents to the science of astronomy. Kepler directed his\r\nattention to three subjects--viz. 'the number, the size, and the motion\r\nof the orbits of the planets.' He endeavoured to ascertain if any\r\nregular proportion existed between the sizes of the planetary orbits, or\r\nin the difference of their sizes, but in this he was unsuccessful. He\r\nthen thought that, by imagining the existence of a planet between Mars\r\nand Jupiter, and another between Venus and Mercury, he might be able to\r\nattain his object; but he found that this assumption afforded him no\r\nassistance. Kepler then imagined that as there were five regular\r\ngeometrical solids, and five planets, the distances of the latter were\r\nregulated by the size of the solids described round one another. The\r\ndiscovery afterwards of two additional planets testified to the\r\nabsurdity of this speculation. A description of these extraordinary\r\nresearches was published, in 1596, in a work entitled 'Prodromus of\r\nCosmographical Dissertations; containing the cosmographical mystery\r\nrespecting the admirable proportion of the celestial orbits, and the\r\ngenuine and real causes of the number, magnitude, and periods of the\r\nplanets, demonstrated by the five regular geometrical solids.' This\r\nvolume, notwithstanding the fanciful speculations which it contained,\r\nwas received with much favour by astronomers, and both Tycho Brahe and\r\nGalileo encouraged Kepler to continue his researches. Galileo admired\r\nhis ingenuity, and Tycho advised him 'to lay a solid foundation for his\r\nviews by actual observation, and then, by ascending from these, to\r\nstrive to reach the causes of things.' Kepler spent many years in these\r\nfruitless endeavours before he made those grand discoveries in search of\r\nwhich he laboured so long.\r\n\r\nThe religious dissensions which at this time agitated Germany were\r\naccompanied in many places by much tumult and excitement. At Gratz the\r\nCatholics threatened to expel the Protestants from the city. Kepler, who\r\nwas of the Reformed faith, having recognised the danger with which he\r\nwas threatened, retired to Hungary with his wife, whom he had recently\r\nmarried, and remained there for near twelve months, during which time he\r\noccupied himself with writing several short treatises on subjects\r\nconnected with astronomy. In 1599 he returned to Gratz and resumed his\r\nprofessorship.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1600 Kepler set out to pay Tycho Brahe a visit at Prague, in\r\norder that he might be able to avail himself of information contained in\r\nobservations made by Tycho with regard to the eccentricities of the\r\norbits of the planets. He was received by Tycho with much cordiality,\r\nand stayed with him for four months at his residence at Benach, Tycho in\r\nthe meantime having promised that he would use his influence with the\r\nEmperor Rudolph to have him appointed as assistant in his observatory.\r\nOn the termination of his visit Kepler returned to Gratz, and as there\r\nwas a renewal of the religious trouble in the city, he resigned his\r\nprofessorship, from which he only derived a small income, and, relying\r\non Tycho's promise, he again journeyed to Prague, and arrived there in\r\n1601. Kepler was presented to the Emperor by Tycho, and the post of\r\nImperial Mathematician was conferred upon him, with a salary of 100\r\nflorins a year, upon condition that he should assist Tycho in his\r\nobservatory. This appointment was of much value to Kepler, because it\r\nafforded him an opportunity of obtaining access to the numerous\r\nastronomical observations made by Tycho, which were of great assistance\r\nto him in the investigation of the subject which he had chosen--viz. the\r\nlaws which govern the motions of the planets, and the form and size of\r\nthe planetary orbits.\r\n\r\nAs an acknowledgment of the Emperor's great kindness, the two\r\nastronomers resolved to compute a new set of astronomical tables, and in\r\nhonour of his Majesty they were to be called the 'Rudolphine Tables.'\r\nThis project pleased the Emperor, who promised to defray the expense of\r\ntheir publication. Logomontanus, Tycho's chief assistant, had entrusted\r\nto him that portion of the work relating to observations on the stars,\r\nand Kepler had charge of the part which embraced the calculations\r\nbelonging to the planets and their orbits. This important work had\r\nscarcely been begun when the departure of Logomontanus, who obtained an\r\nappointment in Denmark, and the death of Tycho Brahe in October 1601,\r\nnecessitated its suspension for a time. Kepler was appointed Chief\r\nMathematician to the Emperor in succession to Tycho--a position of\r\nhonour and distinction, and to which was attached a handsome salary,\r\nthat was paid out of the Imperial treasury. But owing to the continuance\r\nof expensive wars, which entailed a severe drain upon the resources of\r\nthe country, the public funds became very low, and Kepler's salary was\r\nalways in arrear. This condition of things involved him in serious\r\npecuniary difficulties, and the responsibility of having to maintain an\r\nincreasing family added to his anxieties. It was with the greatest\r\ndifficulty that he succeeded in obtaining payment of even a portion of\r\nhis salary, and he was reduced to such straits as to be under the\r\nnecessity of casting nativities in order to obtain money to meet his\r\nmost pressing requirements.\r\n\r\nIn 1609 Kepler published his great work, entitled 'The New Astronomy;\r\nor, Commentaries on the Motions of Mars.' It was by his observation of\r\nMars, which has an orbit of greater eccentricity than that of any of the\r\nother planets, with the exception of Mercury, that he was enabled, after\r\nyears of patient study, to announce in this volume the discovery of two\r\nof the three famous theorems known as Kepler's Laws. The first is, that\r\nall the planets move round the Sun in elliptic orbits, and that the orb\r\noccupies one of the foci. The second is, that the radius-vector, or\r\nimaginary line joining the centre of the planet and the centre of the\r\nSun, describes equal areas in equal times. The third law, which relates\r\nto the connection between the periodic times and the distances of the\r\nplanets, was not discovered until ten years later, when Kepler, in 1619,\r\nissued another work, called the 'Harmonies of the World,' dedicated to\r\nJames I. of England, in which was contained this remarkable law. These\r\nlaws have elevated astronomy to the position of a true physical science,\r\nand also formed the starting-point of Newton's investigations which led\r\nto the discovery of the law of gravitation. Kepler's delight on the\r\ndiscovery of his third law was unbounded. He writes: 'Nothing holds me.\r\nI will indulge in my sacred fury. I will triumph over mankind by the\r\nhonest confession that I have stolen the golden vases of the Egyptians\r\nto build up a tabernacle for my God far away from the confines of Egypt.\r\nIf you forgive me, I rejoice; if you are angry, I can bear it. The die\r\nis cast; the book is written, to be read either now or by posterity I\r\ncare not which. It may well wait a century for a reader, as God has\r\nwaited six thousand years for an observer.'\r\n\r\nWhen Kepler presented his celebrated book to the Emperor, he remarked\r\nthat it was his intention to make a similar attack upon the other\r\nplanets, and promised that he would be successful if his Majesty would\r\nundertake to find the means necessary for carrying on operations. But\r\nthe Emperor had more formidable enemies to contend with nearer home than\r\nJupiter and Saturn, and no funds were forthcoming to assist Kepler in\r\nhis undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe chair of mathematics in the University of Linz having become vacant,\r\nKepler offered himself as a candidate for the appointment, which he was\r\nanxious to obtain; but the Emperor Rudolph was averse to his leaving\r\nPrague, and encouraged him to hope that the arrears of his salary would\r\nbe paid. But past experience led Kepler to have no very sanguine\r\nexpectations on this point; nor was it until after the death of Rudolph,\r\nin 1612, that he was relieved from his pecuniary embarrassments.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of Rudolph's brother, Matthias, to the Austrian throne,\r\nKepler was reappointed Imperial Mathematician; he was also permitted to\r\nhold the professorship at Linz, to which he had been elected. Kepler was\r\nnot loth to remove from Prague, where he had spent eleven years harassed\r\nby poverty and other domestic afflictions. Having settled with his\r\nfamily at Linz, Kepler issued another work, in 1618, entitled 'Epitome\r\nof the Copernican Astronomy,' in which he gave a general account of his\r\nastronomical observations and discoveries, and a summary of his opinions\r\nwith regard to the theories which in those days were the subject of\r\ncontroversial discussion. Almost immediately after its publication it\r\nwas included by the Congregation of the Index, at Rome, in the list of\r\nprohibited books. This occasioned Kepler considerable alarm, as he\r\nimagined it might interfere with the sale of his works, or give rise to\r\ndifficulties in the issue of others. He, however, was assured by his\r\nfriend Remus that the action of the Papal authorities need cause him no\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Matthias died in 1619, and was succeeded by Ferdinand III.,\r\nwho not only retained Kepler in his office, but gave orders that all the\r\narrears of his salary should be paid, including those which accumulated\r\nduring the reign of Rudolph; he also expressed a desire that the\r\n'Rudolphine Tables' should be published without delay and at his cost.\r\nBut other obstacles intervened, for at this time Germany was involved in\r\na civil and religious war, which interfered with all peaceful\r\nvocations. Kepler's library at Linz was sealed up by order of the\r\nJesuits, and the city was for a time besieged by troops. This state of\r\npublic affairs necessitated a considerable delay in the publication of\r\nthe 'Tables.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Rudolphine Tables' were published at Ulm in 1627. They were\r\ncommenced by Tycho Brahe, and completed by Kepler, who made his\r\ncalculations from Tycho's observations, and based them upon his own\r\ngreat discovery of the ellipticity of the orbits of the planets. They\r\nare divided into four parts. The first and third parts contain\r\nlogarithmic and other tables for the purpose of facilitating\r\nastronomical calculations; in the second are tables of the Sun, Moon,\r\nand planets; and in the fourth are indicated the positions of one\r\nthousand stars as determined by Tycho. Kepler made a special journey to\r\nPrague in order to present the 'Tables' to the Emperor, and afterwards\r\nthe Grand Duke of Tuscany sent him a gold chain as an acknowledgment of\r\nhis appreciation of the completion of this great work.\r\n\r\nAlbert Wallenstein, Duke of Friedland, an accomplished scholar and a man\r\nfond of scientific pursuits, made Kepler a most liberal offer if he\r\nwould take up his residence in his dominions. After duly considering\r\nthis proposal, Kepler decided to accept the Duke's offer, provided it\r\nreceived the sanction of the Emperor. This was readily given, and\r\nKepler, in 1629, removed with his family from Linz to Sagan, in Silesia.\r\nThe Duke of Friedland treated him with great kindness and liberality,\r\nand through his influence he was appointed to a professorship in the\r\nUniversity of Rostock. Though Kepler was permitted to retain the pension\r\nbestowed upon him by the late Emperor Rudolph, he was unable after his\r\nremoval to Silesia to obtain payment of it, and there was a large\r\naccumulation of arrears. In a final endeavour to recover the amount\r\nowing to him he travelled to Ratisbon, and appealed to the Imperial\r\nAssembly, but without success. The fatigue which Kepler endured on his\r\njourney, combined with vexation and disappointment, brought on a fever,\r\nwhich terminated fatally. He died on November 15, 1630, when in the\r\nsixtieth year of his age, and was interred in St. Peter's churchyard,\r\nRatisbon.\r\n\r\nKepler was a man of indomitable energy and perseverance, and spared\r\nneither time nor trouble in the accomplishment of any object which he\r\ntook in hand. In thinking over the form of the orbits of the planets, he\r\nwrites: 'I brooded with the whole energy of my mind on this\r\nsubject--asking why they are not other than they are--the number, the\r\nsize, and the motions of the orbits.' But many fanciful ideas passed\r\nthrough Kepler's imaginative brain before he hit upon the true form of\r\nthe planetary orbits. In his 'Mysterium Cosmographicum' he asserts that\r\nthe five kinds of regular polyhedral solids, when described round one\r\nanother, regulated the distances of the planets and size of the\r\nplanetary orbits. In support of this theory he writes as follows: 'The\r\norbit of the Earth is the measure of the rest. About it circumscribe a\r\ndodecahedron. The sphere including this will be that of Mars. About\r\nMars' orbit describe a tetrahedron; the sphere containing this will be\r\nJupiter's orbit. Round Jupiter's describe a cube; the sphere including\r\nthis will be Saturn's. Within the Earth's orbit inscribe an icosahedron;\r\nthe sphere inscribed in it will be Venus's orbit. In Venus inscribe an\r\noctahedron; the sphere inscribed in it will be Mercury's.'\r\n\r\nThe above quotation is an instance of Kepler's wild and imaginative\r\ngenius, which ultimately led him to make those sublime discoveries\r\nassociated with planetary motion which are known as 'Kepler's Laws.'\r\n\r\nHe describes himself as 'troublesome and choleric in politics and\r\ndomestic matters;' but in his relations with scientific men he was\r\naffable and pleasant. He showed no jealousy of a rival, and was always\r\nready to recognise merit in others; nor did he hesitate to acknowledge\r\nany error of his own when more recent discoveries proved that he was\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nSome of his works contain passages, written in a jocular strain,\r\nindicative of a bright and cheerful temperament. The following\r\ncharacteristic paragraph refers to the opinions of the Epicureans with\r\nregard to the appearance of a new star, which they ascribed to a\r\nfortuitous concourse of atoms: 'When I was a youth, with plenty of idle\r\ntime on my hands, I was much taken with the vanity, of which some grown\r\nmen are not ashamed, of making anagrams by transposing the letters of my\r\nname written in Latin so as to make another sentence. Out of Ioannes\r\nKeplerus came _Serpens in akuleo_ (a serpent in his sting); but not\r\nbeing satisfied with the meaning of these words, and being unable to\r\nmake another, I trusted the thing to chance, and, taking out of a pack\r\nof playing-cards as many as there were letters in the name, I wrote one\r\nupon each, and then began to shuffle them, and at each shuffle to read\r\nthem in the order they came, to see if any meaning came of it. Now, may\r\nall the Epicurean gods and goddesses confound this same chance, which,\r\nalthough I have spent a good deal of time over it, never showed me\r\nanything like sense, even from a distance. So I gave up my cards to the\r\nEpicurean eternity, to be carried away into infinity; and it is said\r\nthey are still flying about there, in the utmost confusion, among the\r\natoms, and have never yet come to any meaning. I will tell those\r\ndisputants, my opponents, not my own opinion, but my wife's. Yesterday,\r\nwhen weary with writing, and my mind quite dusty with considering these\r\natoms, I was called to supper, and a salad I had asked for was set\r\nbefore me. \"It seems, then,\" said I aloud, \"that if pewter dishes,\r\nleaves of lettuce, grains of salt, drops of water, vinegar and oil, and\r\nslices of egg, had been flying about in the air from all eternity, it\r\nmight at last happen by chance that there would come a salad.\" \"Yes,\"\r\nsays my wife, \"but not so nice and well dressed as this of mine is.\"'\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the frequent interruptions which, owing to various\r\nreasons, retarded his labours, Kepler was able to bring to a successful\r\ncompletion the numerous and important works upon which he was engaged\r\nduring his lifetime, the voluminous nature of which may be imagined when\r\nit is stated that he published thirty-three separate works, besides\r\nleaving behind twenty-two volumes of manuscript.\r\n\r\nDuring his researches on the motions of Mars, Kepler discovered that the\r\nplanet sometimes travelled at an accelerated rate of speed, and at\r\nanother time its pace was diminished. At one time he observed it to be\r\nin advance of the place where he calculated it should be found, and at\r\nanother time it was behind it. This caused him considerable perplexity,\r\nand, feeling convinced in his mind that the form of the planet's orbit\r\ncould not be circular, he was compelled to turn his attention to some\r\nother closed curve, by which those inequalities of motion could be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nAfter years of careful observation and study, Kepler arrived at the\r\nconclusion that the form of the planet's orbit is an ellipse, and that\r\nthe Sun occupies one of the foci. He afterwards determined that the\r\norbits of all the planets are of an elliptical form.\r\n\r\nHaving discovered the true form of the planetary orbits, Kepler next\r\nendeavoured to ascertain the cause which regulates the unequal motion\r\nthat a planet pursues in its path. He observed that when a planet\r\napproached the Sun its motion was accelerated, and as it receded from\r\nhim its pace became slower.\r\n\r\nThis he explained in his next great discovery by proving that an\r\nimaginary line, or radius-vector, extending from the centre of the Sun\r\nto the centre of the planet 'describes equal areas in equal times.' When\r\nnear the Sun, or at perihelion, a planet traverses a larger portion of\r\nits arc in the same period of time than it does when at the opposite\r\npart of its orbit, or when at aphelion; but, as the areas of both are\r\nequal, it follows that the planet does not always maintain the same rate\r\nof speed, and that its velocity is greatest when nearest the Sun, and\r\nleast when most distant from him.\r\n\r\nBy the application of his first and second laws Kepler was able to\r\nformulate a third law. He found that there existed a remarkable\r\nrelationship between the mean distances of the planets and the times in\r\nwhich they complete their revolutions round the Sun, and discovered\r\n'that the squares of the periodic times are to each in the same\r\nproportion as the cubes of the mean distances.' The periodic time of a\r\nplanet having been ascertained, the square of the mean distance and the\r\nmean distance itself can be obtained. It is by the application of this\r\nlaw that the distances of the planets are usually calculated.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries are known as Kepler's Laws, and are usually classified\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n1. 'The orbit described by every planet is an ellipse, of which the\r\ncentre of the Sun occupies one of the foci.\r\n\r\n2. 'Every planet moves round the Sun in a plane orbit, and the\r\nradius-vector, or imaginary line joining the centre of the planet and\r\nthe centre of the Sun, describes equal areas in equal times.\r\n\r\n3. 'The squares of the periodic times of any two planets are\r\nproportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun.'[1]\r\n\r\nThese remarkable discoveries do not embrace all the achievements by\r\nwhich Kepler has immortalised his name, and earned for himself the proud\r\ntitle of 'Legislator of the Heavens;' he predicted transits of Mercury\r\nand Venus, made important discoveries in optics, and was the inventor of\r\nthe astronomical telescope.\r\n\r\nGALILEO GALILEI, the famous Italian astronomer and philosopher, and the\r\ncontemporary of Kepler and of Milton, was born at Pisa on February 15,\r\n1564.\r\n\r\nHis father, who traced his descent from an ancient Florentine family,\r\nwas desirous that his son should adopt the profession of medicine, and\r\nwith this intention he entered him as a student at the University of\r\nPisa. Galileo, however, soon discovered that the study of mathematics\r\nand mechanical science possessed a greater attraction for his mind,\r\nand, following his inclinations, he resolved to devote his energies to\r\nacquiring proficiency in those subjects.\r\n\r\nIn 1583 his attention was attracted by the oscillation of a brass lamp\r\nsuspended from the ceiling of the cathedral at Pisa. Galileo was\r\nimpressed with the regularity of its motion as it swung backwards and\r\nforwards, and was led to imagine that the pendulum movement might prove\r\na valuable method for the correct measurement of time. The practical\r\napplication of this idea he afterwards adopted in the construction of an\r\nastronomical clock.\r\n\r\nHaving become proficient in mathematics, Galileo, whilst engaged in\r\nstudying the writings of Archimedes, wrote an essay on 'The Hydrostatic\r\nBalance,' and composed a treatise on 'The Centre of Gravity in Solid\r\nBodies.' The reputation which he earned by these contributions to\r\nscience procured for him the appointment of Lecturer on Mathematics at\r\nthe University of Pisa. Galileo next directed his attention to the works\r\nof Aristotle, and made no attempt to conceal the disfavour with which he\r\nregarded many of the doctrines taught by the Greek philosopher; nor had\r\nhe any difficulty in exposing their inaccuracies. One of these, which\r\nmaintained that the heavier of two bodies descended to the earth with\r\nthe greater rapidity, he proved to be incorrect, and demonstrated by\r\nexperiment from the top of the tower at Pisa that, except for the\r\nunequal resistance of the air, all bodies fell to the ground with the\r\nsame velocity.\r\n\r\nAs the chief expounder of the new philosophy, Galileo had to encounter\r\nthe prejudices of the followers of Aristotle, and of all those who\r\ndisliked any innovation or change in the established order of things.\r\nThe antagonism which existed between Galileo and his opponents, who were\r\nboth numerous and influential, was intensified by the bitterness and\r\nsarcasm which he imparted into his controversies, and the attitude\r\nassumed by his enemies at last became so threatening that he deemed it\r\nprudent to resign the Chair of Mathematics in the University of Pisa.\r\n\r\nIn the following year he was appointed to a similar post at Padua, where\r\nhis fame attracted crowds of pupils from all parts of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn 1611 Galileo visited Rome. He was received with much distinction by\r\nthe different learned societies, and was enrolled a member of the\r\nLyncaean Academy. In two years after his visit to the capital he\r\npublished a work in which he declared his adhesion to the Copernican\r\ntheory, and openly avowed his disbelief in the astronomical facts\r\nrecorded in the Scriptures. Galileo maintained that the sacred writings\r\nwere not intended for the purpose of imparting scientific information,\r\nand that it was impossible for men to ignore phenomena witnessed with\r\ntheir eyes, or disregard conclusions arrived at by the exercise of their\r\nreasoning powers.\r\n\r\nThe champions of orthodoxy having become alarmed, an appeal was made to\r\nthe ecclesiastical authorities to assist in suppressing this recent\r\nastronomical heresy, and other obnoxious doctrines, the authorship of\r\nwhich was ascribed to Galileo.\r\n\r\nIn 1615, Galileo was summoned before the Inquisition to reply to the\r\naccusation of heresy. 'He was charged with maintaining the motion of the\r\nEarth and the stability of the Sun; with teaching this doctrine to his\r\npupils; with corresponding on the subject with several German\r\nmathematicians; and with having published it, and attempted to reconcile\r\nit to Scripture in his letters to Mark Velser in 1612.'\r\n\r\nThese charges having been formally investigated by the Inquisition,\r\nCardinal Bellarmine was authorised to communicate with Galileo, and\r\ninform him that unless he renounced the obnoxious doctrines, and\r\npromised 'neither to teach, defend, or publish them in future,' it was\r\ndecreed that he should be committed to prison. Galileo appeared next day\r\nbefore the Cardinal, and, without any hesitation, pledged himself that\r\nfor the future he would adhere to the pronouncement of the Inquisition.\r\n\r\nHaving, as they imagined, silenced Galileo, the Inquisition resolved to\r\ncondemn the entire Copernican system as heretical; and in order to\r\neffectually accomplish this, besides condemning the writings of Galileo,\r\nthey inhibited Kepler's 'Epitome of the Copernican System,' and\r\nCopernicus's own work, 'De Revolutionibus Orbium Celestium.'\r\n\r\nWhether it was that Galileo regarded the Inquisition as a body whose\r\ndecrees were too absurd and unreasonable to be heeded, or that he\r\ndreaded the consequences which might have followed had he remained\r\nobstinate, we know that, notwithstanding the pledges which he gave, he\r\nwas soon afterwards engaged in controversial discussion on those\r\nsubjects which he promised not to mention again.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of his friend Cardinal Barberini to the pontifical\r\nthrone in 1623, under the title of Urban VIII., Galileo undertook a\r\njourney to Rome to offer him his congratulations upon his elevation to\r\nthe papal chair. He was received by his Holiness with marked attention\r\nand kindness, was granted several prolonged audiences, and had conferred\r\nupon him several valuable gifts.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the kindness of Pope Urban and the leniency with which\r\nhe was treated by the Inquisition, Galileo, having ignored his pledge,\r\npublished in 1632 a book, in dialogue form, in which three persons were\r\nsupposed to express their scientific opinions. The first upheld the\r\nCopernican theory and the more recent philosophical views; the second\r\nperson adopted a neutral position, suggested doubts, and made remarks of\r\nan amusing nature; the third individual, called Simplicio, was a\r\nbeliever in Ptolemy and Aristotle, and based his arguments upon the\r\nphilosophy of the ancients.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this work became publicly known, the enemies of Galileo\r\npersuaded the Pope that the third person held up to ridicule was\r\nintended as a representation of himself--an individual regardless of\r\nscientific truth, and firmly attached to the ideas and opinions\r\nassociated with the writings of antiquity.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the publication of the 'Dialogues' Galileo was\r\nsummoned before the Inquisition, and, notwithstanding his feeble health\r\nand the infirmities of advanced age, he was, after a long and tedious\r\ntrial, condemned to abjure by oath on his knees his scientific beliefs.\r\n\r\n'The ceremony of Galileo's abjuration was one of exciting interest and\r\nof awful formality. Clothed in the sackcloth of a repentant criminal,\r\nthe venerable sage fell upon his knees before the assembled cardinals,\r\nand, laying his hand upon the Holy Evangelists, he invoked the Divine\r\naid in abjuring, and detesting, and vowing never again to teach the\r\ndoctrines of the Earth's motion and of the Sun's stability. He pledged\r\nhimself that he would nevermore, either in words or in writing,\r\npropagate such heresies; and he swore that he would fulfil and observe\r\nthe penances which had been inflicted upon him.' 'At the conclusion of\r\nthis ceremony, in which he recited his abjuration word for word and then\r\nsigned it, he was conveyed, in conformity with his sentence, to the\r\nprison of the Inquisition.'[2]\r\n\r\nGalileo's sarcasm, and the bitterness which he imparted into his\r\ncontroversies, were more the cause of his misfortunes than his\r\nscientific beliefs. When he became involved in difficulties he did not\r\npossess the moral courage to enable him to abide by the consequences of\r\nhis acts; nor did he care to become a martyr for the sake of science,\r\nhis submission to the Inquisition having probably saved him from a fate\r\nsimilar to what befell Bruno. Though it would be impossible to justify\r\nGalileo's want of faith in his dealings with the Inquisition, yet one\r\ncannot help sympathising deeply with the aged philosopher, who, in this\r\npainful episode of his life, was compelled to go through the form of\r\nmaking a retractation of his beliefs under circumstances of a most\r\nhumiliating nature.\r\n\r\nBut the persecution of Galileo did not delay the progress of scientific\r\ninquiry nor retard the advancement of the Copernican theory, which,\r\nafter the discovery by Newton of the law of gravitation, was universally\r\nadopted as the true theory of the solar system.\r\n\r\nFerdinand, Duke of Tuscany, having exerted his influence with Pope Urban\r\non behalf of Galileo, he was, after a few days' incarceration, released\r\nfrom prison, and permission was given him to reside at Siena, where he\r\nremained for six months. He was afterwards allowed to return to his\r\nvilla at Arcetri, and, though regarded as a prisoner of the Inquisition,\r\nwas permitted to pursue his studies unmolested for the remainder of his\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nGalileo died at Arcetri on January 8, 1642, when in the seventy-eighth\r\nyear of his age.\r\n\r\nThough not the inventor, he was the first to construct a refracting\r\ntelescope and apply it to astronomical research. With this instrument\r\nhe made a number of important discoveries which tended to confirm his\r\nbelief in the truthfulness of the Copernican theory.\r\n\r\nOn directing his telescope to the Sun, he discovered movable spots on\r\nhis disc, and concluded from his observation of them that the orb\r\nrotated on his axis in about twenty-eight days. He also ascertained that\r\nthe Moon's illumination is due to reflected sunlight, and that her\r\nsurface is diversified by mountains, valleys, and plains.\r\n\r\nOn the night of January 7, 1610, Galileo discovered the four moons of\r\nJupiter. This discovery may be regarded as one of his most brilliant\r\nachievements with the telescope; and, notwithstanding the improvement in\r\nconstruction and size of modern instruments, no other satellite was\r\ndiscovered until near midnight on September 9, 1892, when Mr. E. E.\r\nBarnard, with the splendid telescope of the Lick Observatory, added\r\n'another gem to the diadem of Jupiter.'\r\n\r\nThe phases of Venus and Mars, the triple form of Saturn, and the\r\nconstitution of the Milky Way, which he found to consist of a countless\r\nmultitude of stars, were additional discoveries for our knowledge of\r\nwhich we are indebted to Galileo and his telescope. Galileo made many\r\nother important discoveries in mechanical and physical science. He\r\ndetected the law of falling bodies in their accelerated motion towards\r\nthe Earth, determined the parabolic law of projectiles, and\r\ndemonstrated that matter, even if invisible, possessed the property of\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nIn these pages a short historical description is given of the progress\r\nmade in astronomical science from an early period to the time in which\r\nMilton lived. The discoveries of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo had\r\nraised it to a position of lofty eminence, though the law of\r\ngravitation, which accounts for the form and permanency of the planetary\r\norbits, still remained undiscovered. Theories formerly obscure or\r\nconjectural were either rejected or elucidated with accuracy and\r\nprecision, and the solar system, having the Sun as its centre, with his\r\nattendant family of planets and their satellites revolving in majestic\r\norbits around him, presented an impressive spectacle of order, harmony,\r\nand design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nASTRONOMY IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century embraces the most remarkable epoch in the whole\r\nhistory of astronomy. It was during this period that those wonderful\r\ndiscoveries were made which have been the means of raising astronomy to\r\nthe lofty position which it now occupies among the sciences. The\r\nunrivalled genius and patient labours of the illustrious men whose names\r\nstand out in such prominence on the written pages of the history of this\r\nera have rendered it one of the most interesting and elevating of\r\nstudies. Though Copernicus lived in the preceding century, yet the names\r\nof Tycho Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton, testify to the greatness of\r\nthe discoveries that were made during this period, which have surrounded\r\nthe memories of those men with a lustre of undying fame.\r\n\r\nForemost among astronomers of less conspicuous eminence who made\r\nimportant discoveries in this century we find the name of Huygens.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN HUYGENS was born at The Hague in 1629. He was the second son\r\nof Constantine Huygens, an eminent diplomatist, and secretary to the\r\nPrince of Orange. Huygens studied at Leyden and Breda, and became\r\nhighly distinguished as a geometrician and scientist. He made important\r\ninvestigations relative to the figure of the Earth, and wrote a learned\r\ntreatise on the cause of gravity; he also determined with greater\r\naccuracy investigations made by Galileo regarding the accelerated motion\r\nof bodies when subjected to the influence of that force.\r\n\r\nHuygens admitted that the planets and their satellites attracted each\r\nother with a force varying according to the inverse ratio of the squares\r\nof their distances, but rejected the mutual attraction of the molecules\r\nof matter, believing that they possessed gravity towards a central point\r\nonly, to which they were attracted. This supposition was at variance\r\nwith the Newtonian theory, which, however, was universally regarded as\r\nthe correct one.\r\n\r\nHuygens originated the theory by which it is believed that light is\r\nproduced by the undulatory vibration of the ether; he also discovered\r\npolarization.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the method adopted in the construction of clocks was not\r\ncapable of producing a mechanism which measured time with sufficient\r\naccuracy to satisfy the requirements of astronomers. Huygens endeavoured\r\nto supply this want, and applied his mechanical ingenuity in\r\nconstructing a clock that could be relied upon to keep accurate time.\r\nThough the pendulum motion was first adopted by Galileo, he was unable\r\nto arrange its mechanism so that it should keep up a continuous\r\nmovement. The oscillation of the pendulum ceased after a time, and a\r\nfresh impulse had to be applied to set it in motion. Consequently,\r\nGalileo's clock was of no service as a timekeeper.\r\n\r\nHuygens overcame this difficulty by so arranging the mechanism of his\r\nclock that the balance, instead of being horizontal, was directed\r\nperpendicularly, and prolonged downwards to form a pendulum, the\r\noscillations of which regulated the downward motion of the weight. This\r\ninvention, which was highly applauded, proved to be of great service\r\neverywhere, and was especially valuable for astronomical purposes.\r\n\r\nHuygens next directed his attention to the construction of telescopes,\r\nand displayed much skill in the grinding and polishing of lenses. He\r\nmade several instruments superior in power and accuracy to any that\r\nexisted previously, and with one of these made some remarkable\r\ndiscoveries when observing the planet Saturn.\r\n\r\nThe telescopic appearance of Saturn is one of the most beautiful in the\r\nheavens. The planet, surrounded by two brilliant rings, and accompanied\r\nby eight attendant moons, surpasses all the other orbs of the firmament\r\nas an object of interest and admiration. To the naked eye, Saturn is\r\nvisible as a star of the first magnitude, and was known to the ancients\r\nas the most remote of the planets. Travelling in space at a distance of\r\nnearly one thousand millions of miles from the Sun, the planet\r\naccomplishes a revolution of its mighty orbit in twenty-nine and a half\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nGalileo was the first astronomer who directed a telescope to Saturn. He\r\nobserved that the planet presented a triform appearance, and that on\r\neach side of the central globe there were two objects, in close contact\r\nwith it, which caused it to assume an ovoid shape. After further\r\nobservation, Galileo perceived that the lateral bodies gradually\r\ndecreased in size, until they became invisible. At the expiration of a\r\ncertain period of time they reappeared, and were observed to go through\r\na certain cycle of changes. By the application of increased telescopic\r\npower it was discovered that the appendages were not of a rounded form,\r\nbut appeared as two small crescents, having their concave surfaces\r\ndirected towards the planet and their extremities in contact with it,\r\nresembling the manner in which the handles are attached to a cup.\r\n\r\nThese objects were observed to go through a series of periodic changes.\r\nAfter having become invisible, they reappeared as two luminous straight\r\nbands, projecting from each side of the planet; during the next seven or\r\neight years they gradually opened out, and assumed a crescentic form;\r\nthey afterwards began to contract, and on the expiration of a similar\r\nperiod, during which time they gradually decreased in size, they again\r\nbecame invisible. It was perceived that the appendages completed a cycle\r\nof their changes in about fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1656, Huygens, with a telescope constructed by himself, was enabled\r\nto solve the enigma which for so many years baffled the efforts of the\r\nablest astronomers. He announced his discovery in the form of a Latin\r\ncryptograph which, when deciphered, read as follows:--\r\n\r\n'Annulo cingitur, tenui plano, nusquam cohaerente, ad eclipticam\r\ninclinatio.'\r\n\r\n'The planet is surrounded by a slender flat ring everywhere distinct\r\nfrom its surface, and inclined to the ecliptic.'\r\n\r\nHuygens perceived the shadow of the ring thrown on the planet, and was\r\nable to account in a satisfactory manner for all the phenomena observed\r\nin connection with its variable appearance.\r\n\r\nThe true form of the ring is circular, but by us it is seen\r\nforeshortened; consequently, when the Earth is above or below its plane,\r\nit appears of an elliptical shape. When the position of the planet is\r\nsuch that the plane of the ring passes through the Sun, the edge of the\r\nring only is illumined, and then it becomes invisible for a short\r\nperiod. In the same manner, when the plane of the ring passes through\r\nthe Earth, the illumined edge of the ring is not of sufficient magnitude\r\nto appear visible, but as the enlightened side of the plane becomes more\r\ninclined towards the Earth, the ring comes again into view. When the\r\nplane of the ring passes between the Earth and the Sun, the unillumined\r\nside of the ring is turned towards the Earth, and during the time it\r\nremains in this position it is invisible.\r\n\r\nHuygens discovered the sixth satellite of Saturn (Titan), and also the\r\nGreat Nebula in Orion.\r\n\r\nJOHANN HEVELIUS, a celebrated Prussian astronomer, was born at Dantzig\r\nin 1611, and died in that city in 1687. He was a man of wealth, and\r\nerected an observatory at his residence, where, for a period of forty\r\nyears, he carried out a series of astronomical observations.\r\n\r\nHe constructed a chart of the stars, and in order to complete his work,\r\nformed nine new constellations in those spaces in the celestial vault\r\nwhich were previously un-named. They are known by the names\r\nCamelopardus, Canes Venatici, Coma Bernices, Lacerta, Leo Minor, Lynx,\r\nMonoceros, Sextans, and Vulpecula. He also executed a chart of the\r\nMoon's surface, wrote a description of the lunar spots, and discovered\r\nthe Libration of the Moon in Longitude.\r\n\r\nOn May 30, 1661, Hevelius observed a transit of Mercury, a description\r\nof which he published, and included with it Horrox's treatise on the\r\nfirst-recorded transit of Venus. This work, after having passed through\r\nseveral hands, became the property of Hevelius, who was capable of\r\nappreciating its merits. The manuscript was sent to him by Huygens, and\r\nin acknowledging it he writes: 'How greatly does my Mercury exult in the\r\njoyous prospect that he may shortly fold within his arms Horrox's long\r\nlooked-for and beloved Venus! He renders you unfeigned thanks that by\r\nyour permission this much-desired union is about to be celebrated, and\r\nthat the writer is able, with your concurrence, to introduce them both\r\ntogether to the public.'\r\n\r\nHevelius made numerous researches on comets, and suggested that the\r\nform of their paths might be a parabola.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI DOMENICO CASSINI was born at Perinaldo, near Nice, in 1625. He\r\nstudied at Genoa and Bologna, and was afterwards appointed to the Chair\r\nof Astronomy at the latter University. He was a man of high scientific\r\nattainments, and made many important astronomical discoveries.\r\n\r\nIn 1671 he became Director of the Royal Observatory at Paris, and\r\ndevoted a long life to trying and difficult observations, which in his\r\nlater years deprived him of his eyesight.\r\n\r\nIn 1644 Cassini proved beyond doubt that Jupiter rotated on his axis,\r\nand also assigned his period of rotation with considerable accuracy. He\r\npublished tables of the planet's satellites, and determined their\r\nmotions from observations of their eclipses. He ascertained the periods\r\nof rotation of Venus and Mars; executed a chart of the lunar surface,\r\nand observed an occultation of Jupiter by the Moon.\r\n\r\nCassini discovered the dual nature of Saturn's ring, having perceived\r\nthat instead of one there are two concentric rings separated by a dark\r\nspace. He also discovered four of the planet's satellites--viz. Japetus,\r\nRhea, Dione, and Tethys. He made a near approximation to the solar\r\nparallax by means of researches on the parallax of Mars, and\r\ninvestigated some irregularities of the Moon's motion. Cassini\r\ndiscovered the belts of Jupiter, and also the Zodiacal Light, and\r\nestablished the coincidence of the nodes of the lunar equator and orbit.\r\n\r\nJAQUES CASSINI, son of Giovanni, was born at Paris in 1677. He followed\r\nin his father's footsteps, and wrote several treatises on astronomical\r\nsubjects. He investigated the period of the rotation of Venus on her\r\naxis, and upheld the results arrived at by his father, which were\r\nafterwards confirmed by observations made by Schroeter. Cassini made\r\nsome valuable researches with regard to the proper motion of the stars,\r\nand demonstrated that their change of position on the celestial vault\r\nwas real, and not caused by a displacement of the ecliptic. He attempted\r\nto ascertain the apparent diameter of Sirius, and made observations with\r\nregard to the visibility of the stars. The Cassini family produced\r\nseveral generations of eminent astronomers, whose discoveries and\r\ninvestigations were of much value in advancing the science of astronomy.\r\n\r\nOLAUS ROEMER, an eminent Danish astronomer, was born at Copenhagen\r\nSeptember 25, 1644. When Picard, a French astronomer, visited Denmark in\r\n1671, for the purpose of ascertaining the exact position of\r\n'Uranienburg,' the site of Tycho Brahe's observatory, he made the\r\nacquaintance of Roemer, who was engaged in studying mathematics and\r\nastronomy under Erasmus Bartolinus. Having perceived that the young man\r\nwas gifted with no ordinary degree of talent, he secured his services to\r\nassist him in his observations, and, on the conclusion of his labours,\r\nPicard was so much impressed with the ability displayed by Roemer, that\r\nhe invited him to accompany him to France. This invitation he accepted,\r\nand took up his residence in the French capital, where he continued to\r\nprosecute his astronomical studies.\r\n\r\nIn 1675 Roemer communicated to the Academy of Sciences a paper, in which\r\nhe announced his discovery of the progressive transmission of light. It\r\nwas believed that light travelled instantaneously, but Roemer was able\r\nto demonstrate the inaccuracy of this conclusion, and determined that\r\nlight travels through space with a measurable velocity.\r\n\r\nBy diligently observing the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, Roemer\r\nperceived that sometimes they occurred before, and sometimes after their\r\npredicted times. This irregularity, he discovered, depended upon the\r\nposition of the Earth with regard to Jupiter. When the Earth, in\r\ntraversing her orbit, moved round to the opposite side of the Sun,\r\nthereby bringing Jupiter into conjunction, an eclipse occurred sixteen\r\nminutes twenty-six seconds later than it did when Jupiter was in\r\nopposition or nearest to the Earth. As there existed an impression that\r\nlight travelled instantaneously, it was believed that an eclipse\r\noccurred at the moment it was perceived in the telescope. This, however,\r\nwas not so. Roemer, after a long series of observations, concluded that\r\nthe discrepancies were due to the fact that light travels with a\r\nmeasurable velocity, and that it requires a greater length of time,\r\nupwards of sixteen minutes, to traverse the additional distance--the\r\ndiameter of the Earth's orbit--which intervenes between the Earth and\r\nJupiter, when the planet is in conjunction, as compared with the\r\ndistance between the Earth and Jupiter, when the latter is in\r\nopposition. This discovery of Roemer's was the means of enabling the\r\nvelocity of light to be ascertained, which, according to recent\r\ncalculations, is about 187,000 miles a second. As an acknowledgment of\r\nthe importance of his communication, Roemer was awarded a seat in the\r\nAcademy, and apartments were assigned to him at the Royal Observatory,\r\nwhere he carried on his astronomical studies.\r\n\r\nIn 1681 Roemer returned to Denmark, and was appointed Professor of\r\nMathematics in the University of Copenhagen; he was also entrusted with\r\nthe care of the city observatory--a duty which his reputation as an\r\nastronomer eminently qualified him to undertake. The transit\r\ninstrument--a mechanism of much importance to astronomers--was invented\r\nby Roemer in 1690; it consists of a telescope fixed to a horizontal\r\naxis, and adjusted so as to revolve in the plane of the meridian. It is\r\nemployed in observing the passage of the heavenly bodies across the\r\nobserver's meridian. To note accurately by means of the astronomical\r\nclock the exact instant of time at which a celestial body crosses the\r\ncentre of the field of view is the essential part of a transit\r\nobservation. Small transit instruments are employed for taking the time\r\nand for regulating the observatory clock, but large instruments are\r\nused for delicate and exact observations of Right Ascensions and\r\nDeclinations of stars of different magnitudes. Meridian, and altitude\r\nand azimuth circles, are important astronomical appliances, which owe\r\ntheir existence to the inventive skill of this distinguished astronomer.\r\n\r\nRoemer resided for many years at the observatory in the city of\r\nCopenhagen, where he pursued his astronomical studies until the time of\r\nhis death, which occurred in 1710. He meritoriously attempted to\r\ndetermine the parallax of the fixed stars; and it is said that the\r\nastronomical calculations and observations which he left behind him were\r\nso voluminous as to equal in number those made by Tycho Brahe, nearly\r\nall of which perished in a great conflagration that destroyed the\r\nobservatory and a large portion of the city of Copenhagen in 1728.\r\n\r\nAmong other astronomers of this century whose names deserve recording\r\nwere Descartes and Gassendi, whose mathematical researches in their\r\napplication to astronomy were of much value; Fabricius, Torricelli, and\r\nMaraldi, who by their observations and investigations added many facts\r\nto the general knowledge of the science; and Bayer, to whom belongs the\r\ndistinction of having constructed the first star-atlas.\r\n\r\nIn our own country during this period astronomy was cultivated by a few\r\nenthusiastic men, who devoted their time and talents to promoting the\r\nadvancement of the science. It, however, received no recognition as a\r\nsubject of study at any of the Universities, and no public observatory\r\nexisted in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThough it was not until towards the close of the century that the\r\nattention of all Europe was directed to England in admiration of the\r\ndiscoveries of the illustrious Newton, yet astronomy had its humble\r\nvotaries, and chief among those was a young clergyman of the name of\r\nHorrox.\r\n\r\nJEREMIAH HORROX was born at Toxteth, near Liverpool, in 1619--close on\r\nthree centuries ago. Little is known of his family. His parents have\r\nbeen described as persons who occupied a humble position in life, but,\r\nas they were able to give their son a classical education which fitted\r\nhim for one of the learned professions, it is probable they were not so\r\nobscure as they have been represented to be.\r\n\r\nHaving received his early education at Toxteth, Horrox afterwards\r\nproceeded to Cambridge, and was entered as a student at Emmanuel College\r\non May 18, 1632, when in his fourteenth year.\r\n\r\nAt the University he devoted himself to the study of classics,\r\nespecially Latin, which in those days was the language adopted by men of\r\nlearning, when engaged in writing works of a philosophical and\r\nscientific character.\r\n\r\nAfter having remained at Cambridge for three years, Horrox returned to\r\nhis native county, and was appointed curate of Hoole, a place about\r\neight miles distant from Preston. Hoole is described as a narrow\r\nlow-lying strip of land consisting largely of moss, and almost converted\r\ninto an island by the waters of Martin Mere on the south, and the Ribble\r\non the north; and, though doubtless an open and favourable situation for\r\nastronomical observation, it could not have been attractive as a place\r\nof residence. Yet it was here on November 24, 1639, that Horrox made his\r\nfamous observation of the first recorded transit of Venus, an occurrence\r\nwith which his name will be for ever associated.\r\n\r\nIt was while at Cambridge that Horrox first turned his attention to the\r\nstudy of astronomy. His love of the sublime, and the captivating\r\ninfluence exerted on his mind by the contemplation of the heavenly\r\nbodies, induced him to adopt astronomy as a pursuit congenial to his\r\ntastes, and capable of exercising his highest mental powers. Having this\r\nobject in view, he applied himself with much earnestness to the study of\r\nmathematics; he had, however, to rely mainly upon his own exertions, for\r\nat that time no branch of physical or mathematical science was taught at\r\nCambridge, and consequently he obtained no professional instruction.\r\n\r\nIt was so also with astronomy, which, as a science, was scarcely known\r\nin this country; no regular record of astronomical observations was kept\r\nby any individual observer, and no public observatory existed in England\r\nor in France.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages and obstacles which Horrox had to encounter may be\r\nbest described by quoting his own words. He writes: 'There were many\r\nhindrances. The abstruse nature of the study, my inexperience and want\r\nof means dispirited me. I was much pained not to have any one to whom I\r\ncould look for guidance, or indeed for the sympathy of companionship in\r\nmy endeavours, and I was assailed by the languor and weariness which are\r\ninseparable from every great undertaking. What then was to be done? I\r\ncould not make the pursuit an easy one, much less increase my fortune,\r\nand least of all imbue others with a love for astronomy; and yet to\r\ncomplain of philosophy on account of its difficulties would be foolish\r\nand unworthy. I determined, therefore, that the tediousness of study\r\nshould be overcome by industry; my poverty--failing a better method--by\r\npatience; and that instead of a master I would use astronomical books.\r\nArmed with these weapons I would contend successfully; and, having heard\r\nof others acquiring knowledge without greater help, I would blush that\r\nany one should be able to do more than I, always remembering that word\r\nof Virgil's--\r\n\r\n    Totidem nobis animaeque manusque.\r\n\r\nHaving heard much praise bestowed upon the works of Lansberg, a Flemish\r\nastronomer, Horrox thought it would be to his advantage to procure a\r\ncopy of his writings. This he succeeded in obtaining after some\r\ndifficulty, and devoted a considerable time to calculating Ephemerides,\r\nbased upon the Lansberg Tables, but after making a number of\r\ncomputations he discovered that they were unreliable and inaccurate.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1636 Horrox made the acquaintance of William Crabtree, a\r\ndevoted astronomer, who lived at Broughton, a suburb of Manchester. A\r\nclose friendship soon existed between the two men, and they carried on\r\nan active correspondence about matters relating to the science which\r\nthey both loved so well.\r\n\r\nCrabtree, who was an unbeliever in Lansberg, urged Horrox to discard the\r\nFlemish astronomer's works, and devote his talents to the study of Tycho\r\nBrahe and Kepler. This advice led Horrox to make a more rigorous\r\nexamination of the Lansberg Tables, and after comparing them with the\r\nobservations made by Crabtree, which coincided with his own, he resolved\r\nto renounce them. Acting on the advice of his friend, Horrox directed\r\nhis attention to the writings of Kepler. The youthful astronomer soon\r\nrealised their value, and was charmed with the accuracy of observation\r\nand inductive reasoning displayed in the elucidation of those general\r\nlaws which constituted a new era in the history of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe Rudolphine Tables, which were the astronomical calculations\r\ncommenced by Tycho Brahe, and completed by Kepler, were regarded by\r\nHorrox as much superior to those of Lansberg; but it occurred to him\r\nthat they might be improved by changing some of the numbers, and yet\r\nretaining the hypotheses. To this task he applied himself with much\r\nearnestness and assiduity, and after close application and laborious\r\nstudy he accomplished the arduous undertaking of bringing those tables\r\nto a high state of perfection.\r\n\r\nIn his investigation of the Lunar theory, Horrox outstripped all his\r\npredecessors, and Sir Isaac Newton distinctly affirms he was the first\r\nto discover that the Moon's motion round the Earth is in the form of an\r\nellipse with the centre in the lower focus. Besides having made this\r\ndiscovery, Horrox was able to explain the causes of the inequalities of\r\nthe Moon's motion, which render the exact computation of her elements so\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Equation, an irregularity discovered by Tycho Brahe, which is\r\nproduced by the increase and decrease of the Sun's disturbing force as\r\nthe Earth approaches or recedes from him in her orbit, had its value\r\nfirst assigned by Horrox. This he calculated to be eleven minutes\r\nsixteen seconds, which is within four seconds of what it has since been\r\nproved to be by the most recent observations.\r\n\r\nThe Evection, an irregular motion of the Moon discovered by Ptolemy,\r\nwhereby her mean longitude is increased or diminished, was explained by\r\nHorrox as depending upon the libratory motion of the apsides, and the\r\nchange which takes place in the eccentricity of the lunar orbit.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries were made by Horrox before he attained the age of\r\ntwenty years, and if his reputation had alone rested upon them his name\r\nwould have been honourably associated with those who have attained to\r\nthe highest eminence in astronomy.\r\n\r\nAnother achievement which adds lustre to Horrox's name consists in his\r\ndetection of the inequality in the mean motions of Jupiter and Saturn.\r\n\r\nHe also directed his attention to the study of cometary bodies, and\r\narrived at certain conclusions with regard to the nature of their\r\nmovements. At first, he believed like Kepler that comets were projected\r\nin straight lines from the Sun; this supposition having been upheld on\r\naccount of the great elongation of their orbits. He next perceived that\r\ntheir velocity increased as they approached the Sun, and decreased as\r\nthey receded from him. Afterwards he says, 'They move in an elliptic\r\nfigure or near it,' and finally he arrived at the conclusion that\r\n'comets move in elliptical orbits, being carried round the Sun with a\r\nvelocity which is probably variable.' This theory has been verified by\r\nnumerous observations, and is now generally accepted by astronomers.\r\n\r\nHorrox also made a series of observations on the tides. He notified the\r\nextent of their rise and fall at different periods, and investigated\r\nother phenomena associated with their ebb and flow. After having\r\ncontinued his observations for some time, he wrote to his friend\r\nCrabtree, and informed him that he had perceived many interesting\r\ndetails which had not been previously described, and he hoped to be\r\nable to arrive at some important conclusions with regard to their nature\r\nand cause. Unfortunately, Horrox's writings on this subject, along with\r\nmany other important papers, have been lost or destroyed. We are\r\ntherefore ignorant of the result of his researches, which were the first\r\nundertaken by any person for the purpose of scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\nFrom his study of the Lansberg and Rudolphine Tables, Horrox arrived at\r\nthe conclusion that a transit of Venus would occur on November 24, 1639.\r\nThis transit was for some unaccountable reason overlooked by Kepler, who\r\npredicted one in 1631, and the next not until 1761. The transit of 1631\r\nwas not visible in Europe.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Horrox for a description of the transit of 1639--the\r\nfirst that was ever observed of which there is any record; and were it\r\nnot for the accuracy of his calculations, the occurrence of the\r\nphenomenon would have been unperceived, and no history of the\r\nconjunction would have been handed down to posterity. As soon as Horrox\r\nhad assured himself of the time when the transit would take place, he\r\nwrote to Crabtree to inform him of the date, and asked him to make\r\nobservations with his telescope, and especially to examine the diameter\r\nof the planet, which he thought had been over-estimated. He also\r\nrequested him to write to Dr. Foster of Cambridge, and inform him of the\r\nexpected event, as it was desirable that the transit should be observed\r\nfrom several places in consequence of the possibility of failure, owing\r\nto an overcast sky. His letter is dated October 26, 1639. He says: 'My\r\nreason for now writing is to advise you of a remarkable conjunction of\r\nthe Sun and Venus on the 24th of November, when there will be a transit.\r\nAs such a thing has not happened for many years past, and will not occur\r\nagain in this century, I earnestly entreat you to watch attentively with\r\nyour telescope in order to observe it as well as you can.\r\n\r\n'Notice particularly the diameter of Venus, which is stated by Kepler to\r\nbe seven minutes, and by Lansberg to be eleven, but which I believe to\r\nbe scarcely greater than one minute.'\r\n\r\nIn describing the method which he adopted for observing the transit,\r\nHorrox writes as follows: 'Having attentively examined Venus with my\r\ninstrument, I described on a sheet of paper a circle, whose diameter was\r\nnearly equal to six inches--the narrowness of the apartment not\r\npermitting me conveniently to use a larger size. I divided the\r\ncircumference of this circle into 360 degrees in the usual manner, and\r\nits diameter into thirty equal parts, which gives about as many minutes\r\nas are equivalent to the Sun's apparent diameter. Each of these thirty\r\nparts was again divided into four equal portions, making in all one\r\nhundred and twenty; and these, if necessary, may be more minutely\r\nsubdivided. The rest I left to ocular computation, which, in such small\r\nsections, is quite as certain as any mechanical division. Suppose,\r\nthen, each of these thirty parts to be divided into sixty seconds,\r\naccording to the practice of astronomers. When the time of the\r\nobservation approached, I retired to my apartment, and, having closed\r\nthe windows against the light, I directed my telescope--previously\r\nadjusted to a focus--through the aperture towards the Sun, and received\r\nhis rays at right angles upon the paper already mentioned. The Sun's\r\nimage exactly filled the circle, and I watched carefully and unceasingly\r\nfor any dark body that might enter upon the disc of light.\r\n\r\n'Although the corrected computation of Venus' motions which I had before\r\nprepared, and on the accuracy of which I implicitly relied, forbade me\r\nto expect anything before three o'clock in the afternoon of the 24th,\r\nyet since, according to the calculations of most astronomers, the\r\nconjunction should take place sooner--by some even on the 23rd--I was\r\nunwilling to depend entirely on my own opinion, which was not\r\nsufficiently confirmed, lest by too much self-confidence I might\r\nendanger the observation. Anxiously intent, therefore, on the\r\nundertaking through the greater part of the 23rd, and on the whole of\r\nthe 24th, I omitted no available opportunity of observing her ingress. I\r\nwatched carefully on the 24th from sunrise to nine o'clock, and from a\r\nlittle before ten until noon, and at one in the afternoon, being called\r\naway in the intervals by business of the highest importance, which for\r\nthese ornamental pursuits I could not with propriety neglect.[3] But\r\nduring all this time I saw nothing in the Sun except a small and common\r\nspot, consisting as it were of three points at a distance from the\r\ncentre towards the left, which I noticed on the preceding and following\r\ndays. This evidently had nothing to do with Venus. About fifteen minutes\r\npast three in the afternoon, when I was again at liberty to continue my\r\nlabours, the clouds, as if by divine interposition, were entirely\r\ndispersed, and I was once more invited to the grateful task of repeating\r\nmy observations. I then beheld a most agreeable spectacle--the object of\r\nmy sanguine wishes; a spot of unusual magnitude and of a perfectly\r\ncircular shape, which had already fully entered upon the Sun's disc on\r\nthe left, so that the limbs of the Sun and Venus precisely coincided,\r\nforming an angle of contact. Not doubting that this was really the\r\nshadow of the planet, I immediately applied myself sedulously to observe\r\nit.\r\n\r\n'In the first place, with respect to the inclination, the line of the\r\ndiameter of the circle being perpendicular to the horizon, although its\r\nplane was somewhat inclined on account of the Sun's altitude, I found\r\nthat the shadow of Venus at the aforesaid hour--namely, fifteen minutes\r\npast three--had entered the Sun's disc about 62 deg. 30', certainly between\r\n60 deg. and 65 deg., from the top towards the right. This was the appearance in\r\nthe dark apartment; therefore, out of doors, beneath the open sky,\r\naccording to the laws of optics, the contrary would be the case, and\r\nVenus would be below the centre of the Sun, distant 62 deg. 30' from the\r\nlower limbs or the nadir, as the Arabians term it. The inclination\r\nremained to all appearances the same until sunset, when the observation\r\nwas concluded.\r\n\r\n'In the second place, the distance between the centres of Venus and the\r\nSun I found by three observations to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n          The Hour.          | Distance of the Centres.\r\n                             |\r\nAt 3.15 by the clock         |        14' 24''\r\n \" 3.35      \"               |        13' 30''\r\n \" 3.45      \"               |        13'  0''\r\n \" 3.50 the apparent sunset. |\r\n\r\nThe true setting being 3.45, and the apparent about 5 minutes later, the\r\ndifference being caused by refraction. The clock therefore was\r\nsufficiently correct.\r\n\r\n'In the third place I found after careful and repeated observation that\r\nthe diameter of Venus, as her shadow was depicted on the paper, was\r\nlarger indeed than the thirtieth part of the solar diameter, though not\r\nmore so than the sixth, or at the utmost the fifth of such a part.\r\nTherefore let the diameter of the Sun be to the diameter of Venus as 30'\r\nto 1' 12''. Certainly her diameter never equalled 1' 30'', scarcely\r\nperhaps 1' 20'', and this was evident as well when the planet was near\r\nthe Sun's limb as when far distant from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENUS ON THE SUN'S DISC.]\r\n\r\n'This observation was made in an obscure village where I have long been\r\nin the habit of observing, about fifteen miles to the north of\r\nLiverpool, the latitude of which I believe to be 53 deg. 20', although by\r\ncommon maps it is stated at 54 deg. 12', therefore the latitude of the\r\nvillage will be 53 deg. 35', and longitude of both 22 deg. 30' from the\r\nFortunate Islands, now called the Canaries. This is 14 deg. 15' to the west\r\nof Uraniburg in Denmark, the longitude of which is stated by Brahe, a\r\nnative of the place, to be 36 deg. 45' from these islands.\r\n\r\n'This is all I could observe respecting this celebrated conjunction\r\nduring the short time the Sun remained in the horizon: for although\r\nVenus continued on his disc for several hours, she was not visible to me\r\nlonger than half an hour on account of his so quickly setting.\r\nNevertheless, all the observations which could possibly be made in so\r\nshort a time I was enabled by Divine Providence to complete so\r\neffectually that I could scarcely have wished for a more extended\r\nperiod. The inclination was the only point upon which I failed to attain\r\nthe utmost precision; for, owing to the rapid motion of the Sun it was\r\ndifficult to observe with certainty to a single degree, and I frankly\r\nconfess that I neither did nor could ascertain it. But all the rest is\r\nsufficiently accurate, and as exact as I could desire.'\r\n\r\nBesides having ascertained that the diameter of Venus subtends an angle\r\nnot much greater than one minute of arc, Horrox reduced the horizontal\r\nsolar parallax from fifty-seven seconds as stated by Kepler to fourteen\r\nseconds, a calculation within one and a half second of the value\r\nassigned to it by Halley sixty years after. He also reduced the Sun's\r\nsemi-diameter.\r\n\r\nCrabtree, to whom Horrox refers as 'his most esteemed friend and a\r\nperson who has few superiors in mathematical learning,' made\r\npreparations to observe the transit similar to those already described.\r\nBut the day was unfavourable, dark clouds obscured the sky and rendered\r\nthe Sun invisible. Crabtree was in despair, and relinquished all hope of\r\nbeing able to witness the conjunction. However, just before sunset there\r\nwas a break in the clouds, and the Sun shone brilliantly for a short\r\ninterval. Crabtree at once seized his opportunity, and to his intense\r\ndelight observed the planet fully entered upon the Sun's disc. Instead\r\nof proceeding to take observations, he was so overcome with emotion at\r\nthe sight of the phenomenon, that he continued to gaze upon it with rapt\r\nattention, nor did he recover his self-possession until the clouds again\r\nhid from his view the setting Sun.[4]\r\n\r\nCrabtree's observation of the transit was, however, not a fruitless one.\r\nHe drew from memory a diagram showing the exact position of Venus on the\r\nSun's disc, which corresponded in every respect with Horrox's\r\nobservation; he also estimated the diameter of the planet to be 7/200\r\nthat of the Sun, which when calculated gives one minute three seconds;\r\nHorrox having found it to be one minute twelve seconds. This transit of\r\nVenus is remarkable as having been the first ever observed of which\r\nthere is any record, and for this we are indebted to the genius of\r\nHorrox, who by a series of calculations, displaying a wonderfully\r\naccurate knowledge of mathematics, was enabled to predict the occurrence\r\nof the phenomenon on the very day, and almost at the hour it appeared,\r\nand of which he and his friend Crabtree were the only observers.\r\n\r\nHaving thought it desirable to write an account of the transit, Horrox\r\nprepared an elegant Latin treatise, entitled 'Venus in Sole\r\nVisa'--'Venus seen in the Sun;' but not knowing what steps to take with\r\nregard to its publication, he requested Crabtree to communicate with his\r\nbookseller and obtain his advice on the matter.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Horrox returned to Toxteth, and arranged to fulfil a\r\nlong-promised visit to Crabtree, which he looked forward to with much\r\npleasure, as it would afford him an opportunity of discussing with his\r\nfriend many matters of interest to both. This visit was frustrated in a\r\nmanner altogether unexpected. For we read that Horrox was seized with a\r\nsudden and severe illness, the nature of which is not known, and that\r\nhis death occurred on the day previous to that of his intended visit to\r\nhis friend at Broughton. He expired on January 3, 1641, when in the 23rd\r\nyear of his age.\r\n\r\nHis death was a great grief to Crabtree, who, in one of his letters,\r\ndescribes it as 'an irreparable loss:' and it is believed that he only\r\nsurvived him a few years.[5] Of the papers left by Horrox, only a few\r\nhave been preserved, and these were discovered in Crabtree's house after\r\nhis death. Among them was his treatise on the transit of Venus which,\r\nwith other papers, was purchased by Dr. Worthington, Fellow of Emmanuel\r\nCollege, Cambridge, a man of learning, who was capable of appreciating\r\ntheir value. Ultimately, the treatise fell into the possession of\r\nHevelius, a celebrated German astronomer, who published it along with a\r\ndissertation of his own, describing a transit of Mercury.\r\n\r\nHorrox did not live to see any of his writings published, nor was any\r\nmonument erected to his memory until nearly two hundred years after his\r\ndeath. But his name, though long forgotten except by astronomers, is now\r\nengraved on marble in Westminster Abbey. Had his life been spared, it\r\nwould have been difficult to foretell to what eminence and fame he might\r\nhave risen, or what further discoveries his genius might have enabled\r\nhim to make. Few among English astronomers will hesitate to rank him\r\nnext with the illustrious Newton, and all will agree with Herschel, who\r\ncalled him 'the pride and the boast of British Astronomy.'\r\n\r\nWILLIAM GASCOIGNE was born in 1612, in the parish of Rothwell, in the\r\ncounty of York, and afterwards resided at Middleton, near Leeds.\r\n\r\nHe was a man of an inventive turn of mind, and possessed good abilities,\r\nwhich he devoted to improving the methods of telescopic observation.\r\n\r\nAt an early age he was occupied in observing celestial objects, making\r\nresearches in optics, and acquiring a proficient knowledge of astronomy.\r\n\r\nAmong his acquaintances were Crabtree and Horrox, with whom he carried\r\non a correspondence on matters appertaining to their favourite study.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of small angles was found at all times to be one of the\r\ngreatest difficulties which astronomers had to contend with. Tycho Brahe\r\nwas so misled by his measurements of the apparent diameters of the Sun\r\nand Moon, that he concluded a total eclipse of the Sun was impossible.\r\n\r\nGascoigne overcame this difficulty by his invention of the micrometer.\r\nThis instrument, when applied to a telescope, was found to be of great\r\nservice in the correct measurement of minute angles and distances, and\r\nwas the means of greatly advancing the progress of practical astronomy\r\nin the seventeenth century. A micrometer consists of a short tube,\r\nacross the opening of which are stretched two parallel wires; these\r\nbeing intersected at right angles by a third. The wires are moved to or\r\nfrom each other by delicately constructed screws, to which they are\r\nattached. Each revolution, or part of a revolution, of a screw indicates\r\nthe distance by which the wires are moved.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, when placed in the focus of a lens, gives very accurate\r\nmeasurements of the diameters of celestial objects. It was successfully\r\nused by Gascoigne in determining the apparent diameters of the Sun,\r\nMoon, and several of the planets, and the mutual distances of the stars\r\nwhich form the Pleiades.\r\n\r\nCrabtree, after having paid Gascoigne a visit in 1639, describes in a\r\nletter to Horrox the impression created on his mind by the micrometer.\r\nHe writes: 'The first thing Mr. Gascoigne showed me was a large\r\ntelescope, amplified and adorned with new inventions of his own, whereby\r\nhe can take the diameters of the Sun or Moon, or any small angle in the\r\nheavens or upon the earth, most exactly through the glass to a second.'\r\n\r\nThe micrometer is now regarded as an indispensable appliance in the\r\nobservatory; the use of a spider web reticule instead of wire having\r\nimproved its efficiency. Gascoigne was one of the earliest astronomers\r\nwho recognised the value of the Keplerian telescope for observational\r\npurposes, and Sherburn affirms that he was the first to construct an\r\ninstrument of this description having two convex lenses. Whether this be\r\ntrue or not, it is certain that he applied the micrometer to the\r\ntelescope, and was the first to use telescopic sights, by means of which\r\nhe was able to fix the optical axis of his telescope, and ascertain by\r\nobservation the apparent positions of the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nCrabtree, in a letter to Gascoigne, says: 'Could I purchase it with\r\ntravel, or procure it with gold, I would not be without a telescope for\r\nobserving small angles in the heavens; or want the use of your device of\r\na glass in a cane upon the movable ruler of your sextant, as I remember\r\nfor helping to the exact point of the Sun's rays.'\r\n\r\nIt was not known until the beginning of the eighteenth century that\r\nGascoigne had invented and used telescopic sights for the purpose of\r\nmaking accurate astronomical observations. The accidental discovery of\r\nsome documents which contained a description of his appliances was the\r\nmeans by which this became known.\r\n\r\nTownley states that Gascoigne had completed a treatise on optics, which\r\nwas ready for publication, but that no trace of the manuscript could be\r\ndiscovered after his death. Having embraced the Royalist cause, William\r\nGascoigne joined the forces of Charles I., and fell in the battle of\r\nMarston Moor on July 2, 1644.\r\n\r\nThe early death of this young and remarkably clever man was a severe\r\nblow to the science of astronomy in England.\r\n\r\nThe invention of logarithms, by Baron Napier, of Merchistoun, was found\r\nto be of inestimable value to astronomers in facilitating and\r\nabbreviating the methods of astronomical calculation.\r\n\r\nBy the use of logarithms, arithmetical computations which necessitated\r\nlaborious application for several months could with ease be completed in\r\nas many days. It was remarked by Laplace that this invention was the\r\nmeans of doubling the life of an astronomer, besides enabling him to\r\navoid errors and the tediousness associated with long and abstruse\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS HARRIOT, an eminent mathematician, and an assiduous astronomer,\r\nmade some valuable observations of the comet of 1607. He was one of the\r\nearliest observers who made use of the telescope, and it was claimed on\r\nhis behalf that he discovered Jupiter's satellites, and the spots on the\r\nSun, independently of Galileo. Other astronomers have been desirous of\r\nsharing this honour, but it has been conclusively proved that Galileo\r\nwas the first who made those discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Norwood and Gilbert, the mechanical genius of\r\nHooke, and the patient researches of Flamsteed--the first Astronomer\r\nRoyal--were of much value in perfecting many details associated with the\r\nstudy of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Observatory at Greenwich was founded in 1675. The building was\r\nerected under a warrant from Charles II. It announces the desire of the\r\nSovereign to build a small observatory in the park at Greenwich, 'in\r\norder to the finding out of the longitude for perfecting the art of\r\nnavigation and astronomy.' This action on the part of the King may be\r\nregarded as the first public acknowledgment of the usefulness of\r\nastronomy for national purposes.\r\n\r\nSince its erection, the observatory has been presided over by a\r\nsuccession of talented men, who have raised it to a position of eminence\r\nand usefulness unsurpassed by any similar institution in this or any\r\nother country. The well-known names of Flamsteed, Halley, Bradley, and\r\nAiry, testify to the valuable services rendered by those past directors\r\nof the Greenwich Observatory in the cause of astronomical science.\r\n\r\nIf we take a general survey of the science of astronomy as it existed\r\nfrom 1608 to 1674--a period that embraced the time in which Milton\r\nlived--we shall find that it was still compassed by ignorance,\r\nsuperstition, and mystery. Astrology was zealously cultivated; most\r\npersons of rank and position had their nativity or horoscope cast, and\r\nthe belief in the ruling of the planets, and their influence on human\r\nand terrestrial affairs, was through long usage firmly established in\r\nthe public mind. Indeed, at this time, astronomy was regarded as a\r\nhandmaid to astrology; for, with the aid of astronomical calculation,\r\nthe professors of this occult science were enabled to predict the\r\npositions of the planets, and by this means practised their art with an\r\napparent degree of truthfulness.\r\n\r\nAlthough over one hundred years had elapsed since the death of\r\nCopernicus, his theory of the solar system did not find many supporters,\r\nand the old forms of astronomical belief still retained their hold on\r\nthe minds of the majority of philosophic thinkers. This can be partly\r\naccounted for, as many of the Ptolemaic doctrines were at first\r\nassociated with the Copernican theory, nor was it until a later period\r\nthat they were eliminated from the system.\r\n\r\nThough Copernicus deserved the credit of having transferred the centre\r\nof our system from the Earth to the Sun, yet his theory was imperfect in\r\nits details, and contained many inaccuracies. He believed that the\r\nplanets could only move round the Sun in circular paths, nor was he\r\ncapable of conceiving of any other form of orbit in which they could\r\nperform their revolutions. He was therefore compelled to retain the use\r\nof cycles and epicycles, in order to account for irregularities in the\r\nuniformly circular motions of those bodies.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the genius of Kepler for having placed the Copernican\r\nsystem upon a sure and irremovable basis, and for having raised\r\nastronomy to the position of a true physical science. By his discovery\r\nthat the planets travel round the Sun in elliptical orbits, he was\r\nenabled to abolish cycles and epicycles, which created such confusion\r\nand entanglement in the system, and to explain many apparent\r\nirregularities of motion by ascribing to the Sun his true position with\r\nregard to the motions of the planets.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Kepler, which occurred in 1630, the most eminent\r\nsupporter of the Copernican theory was the illustrious Galileo, whose\r\nbelief in its accuracy and truthfulness was confirmed by his own\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nFive of the planets were known at this time--viz. Mercury, Venus, Mars,\r\nJupiter, and Saturn; the latter, which revolves in its orbit at a\r\nprofound distance from the Sun, formed what at that time was believed to\r\nbe the boundary of the planetary system. The distance of the Earth from\r\nthe Sun was approximately known, and the orb was observed to rotate on\r\nhis axis.\r\n\r\nIt was also ascertained that the Moon shone by reflected light, and that\r\nher surface was varied by inequalities resembling those of our Earth.\r\nThe elliptical form of her orbit had been discovered by Horrox, and her\r\nelements were computed with a certain degree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe cloudy luminosity of the Milky Way had been resolved into a\r\nmultitude of separate stars, disclosing the immensity of the stellar\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nThe crescent form of the planet Venus, the satellites of Jupiter and of\r\nSaturn, and the progressive motion and measurement of light, had also\r\nbeen discovered. Observations were made of transits of Mercury and\r\nVenus, and refracting and reflecting telescopes were invented.\r\n\r\nThe law of universal gravitation, a power which retains the Earth and\r\nplanets in their orbits, causing them year after year to describe with\r\nunerring regularity their oval paths round the Sun, was not known at\r\nthis time. Though Newton was born in 1642, he did not disclose the\r\nresults of his philosophic investigations until 1687--thirteen years\r\nafter the death of Milton--when, in the 'Principia,' he announced his\r\ndiscovery of the great law of universal gravitation.\r\n\r\nKepler, though he discovered the laws of planetary motion, was unable to\r\ndetermine the motive force which guided and retained those bodies in\r\ntheir orbits. It was reserved for the genius of Newton to solve this\r\nwonderful problem. This great philosopher was able to prove 'that every\r\nparticle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a\r\nforce proportioned to the mass of the attracting body, and inversely as\r\nthe square of the distance between them.' Newton was capable of\r\ndemonstrating that the force which guides and retains the Earth and\r\nplanets in their orbits resides in the Sun, and by the application of\r\nthis law of gravitation he was able to explain the motions of all\r\ncelestial bodies entering into the structure of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThis discovery may be regarded as the crowning point of the science of\r\nastronomy, for, upon the unfailing energy of this mysterious power\r\ndepend the order and stability of the universe, extending as it does to\r\nall material bodies existing in space, guiding, controlling, and\r\nretaining them in their several paths and orbits, whether it be a tiny\r\nmeteor, a circling planet, or a mighty sun.\r\n\r\nThe nature of cometary bodies and the laws which govern their motions\r\nwere at this time still enshrouded in mystery, and when one of those\r\nerratic wanderers made its appearance in the sky it was beheld by the\r\nmajority of mankind with feelings of awe and superstitious dread, and\r\nregarded as a harbinger of evil and disaster, the precursor of war, of\r\nfamine, or the overthrow of an empire.\r\n\r\nNewton, however, was able to divest those bodies of the mystery with\r\nwhich they were surrounded by proving that any conic section may be\r\ndescribed about the Sun, consistent with the law of gravitation, and\r\nthat comets, notwithstanding the eccentricity of their orbits, obey the\r\nlaws of planetary motion.\r\n\r\nBeyond the confines of our solar system, little was known of the\r\nmagnitude and extent of the sidereal universe which occupies the\r\ninfinitude of space by which we are surrounded. The stars were\r\nrecognised as self-luminous bodies, inconceivably remote, and although\r\nthey excited the curiosity of observers, and conjectures were made as to\r\ntheir origin, yet no conclusive opinions were arrived at with regard to\r\ntheir nature and constitution, and except that they were regarded as\r\nglittering points of light which illumine the firmament, all else\r\nappertaining to them remained an unravelled mystery. Even Copernicus had\r\nno notion of a universe of stars.\r\n\r\nGalileo, by his discovery that the galaxy consists of a multitude of\r\nseparate stars too remote to be defined by ordinary vision, demonstrated\r\nhow vast are the dimensions of the starry heavens, and on what a\r\nstupendous scale the universe is constructed. But at this time it had\r\nnot occurred to astronomers, nor was it known until many years after,\r\nthat the stars are suns which shine with a splendour resembling that of\r\nour Sun, and in many instances surpassing it. It was not until this\r\ntruth became known that the glories of the sidereal heavens were fully\r\ncomprehended, and their magnificence revealed. It was then ascertained\r\nthat the minute points of light which crowd the fields of our largest\r\ntelescopes, in their aggregations forming systems, clusters, galaxies,\r\nand universes of stars, are shining orbs of light, among the countless\r\nmultitudes of which our Sun may be numbered as one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMILTON'S ASTRONOMICAL KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be reasonable to imagine that Milton's knowledge of astronomy\r\nwas comprehensive and accurate, and superior to that possessed by most\r\nscientific men of his age. His scholarly attainments, his familiarity\r\nwith ancient history and philosophy, his profound learning, and the\r\nuniversality of his general knowledge, would lead one to conclude that\r\nthe science which treats of the mechanism of the heavens, and especially\r\nthe observational part of it--which at all times has been a source of\r\ninspiration to poets of every degree of excellence--was to him a study\r\nof absorbing interest, and one calculated to make a deep impression upon\r\nhis devoutly poetical mind. The serious character of Milton's verse, and\r\nthe reverent manner in which celestial incidents and objects are\r\ndescribed in it, impress one with the belief that his contemplation of\r\nthe heavens, and of the orbs that roll and shine in the firmament\r\noverhead, afforded him much enjoyment and meditative delight. For no\r\npoet, in ancient or in modern times, has introduced into his writings\r\nwith such frequency, or with such pleasing effect, so many passages\r\ndescriptive of the beauty and grandeur of the heavens. No other poet,\r\nby the creative effort of his imagination, has soared to such a height;\r\nnor has he ever been excelled in his descriptions of the celestial orbs,\r\nand of the beautiful phenomena associated with their different motions.\r\n\r\nIn his minor poems, which were composed during his residence at Horton,\r\na charming rural retreat in Buckinghamshire, where the freshness and\r\nvaried beauty of the landscape and the attractive aspects of the\r\nmidnight sky were ever before him, we find enchanting descriptions of\r\ncelestial objects, and especially of those orbs which, by their\r\nbrilliancy and lustre, have always commanded the admiration of mankind.\r\n\r\nFor example, in 'L'Allegro' there are the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    Right against the eastern gate\r\n    Where the great Sun begins his state,\r\n    Robed in flames and amber light,\r\n    The clouds in thousand liveries dight;\r\n\r\nand in 'Il Penseroso'--\r\n\r\n    To behold the wandering Moon,\r\n    Riding near her highest noon,\r\n    Like one that had been led astray\r\n    Through the heaven's wide pathless way,\r\n    And oft as if her head she bowed,\r\n    Stooping through a fleecy cloud.\r\n\r\nIn the happy choice of his theme, and by the comprehensive manner in\r\nwhich he has treated it, Milton has been enabled by his poetic genius to\r\ngive to the world in his 'Paradise Lost' a poem which, for sublimity of\r\nthought, loftiness of imagination, and beauty of expression in metrical\r\nverse, is unsurpassed in any language.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, our intention to deal only with those passages in the\r\npoem in which allusion is made to the heavenly bodies, and to incidents\r\nand occurrences associated with astronomical phenomena. In the\r\nexposition and illustration of these it has been considered desirable to\r\nadopt the following general classification:--\r\n\r\n1. To ascertain the extent of Milton's astronomical knowledge.\r\n\r\n2. To describe the starry heavens and the celestial objects mentioned in\r\n'Paradise Lost.'\r\n\r\n3. To exemplify the use which Milton has made of astronomy in the\r\nexercise of his imaginative and descriptive powers.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier half of the seventeenth century the Ptolemaic theory--by\r\nwhich it was believed that the Earth was the immovable centre of the\r\nuniverse, and that round it all the heavenly bodies completed a diurnal\r\nrevolution--still retained its ascendency over the minds of men of\r\nlearning and science, and all the doctrines associated with this ancient\r\nastronomical creed were still religiously upheld by the educated classes\r\namong the peoples inhabiting the different civilised regions of the\r\nglobe. The Copernican theory--by which the Sun is assigned the central\r\nposition in our system, with the Earth and planets revolving in orbits\r\nround him--obtained the support of a few persons of advanced views and\r\nhigh scientific attainments, but its doctrines had not yet seriously\r\nthreatened the supremacy of the older system. Though upwards of one\r\nhundred years had elapsed since the death of Copernicus, yet the\r\ndoctrines associated with the system of which he was the founder were\r\nbut very tardily adopted up to this time. There were several reasons\r\nwhich accounted for this. The Copernican system was at first imperfect\r\nin its details, and included several of the Ptolemaic, doctrines which\r\nrendered it less intelligible, and retarded its acceptance by persons\r\nwho would otherwise have been inclined to adopt it. Copernicus believed\r\nthat the planets travelled round the Sun in circular paths. This\r\nnecessitated the retention of cycles and epicycles, which gave rise to\r\nmuch confusion; nor was it until Kepler made his great discovery of the\r\nellipticity of the planetary orbits that they were eliminated from the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAs the Ptolemaic system of the universe held complete sway over the\r\nminds of men for upwards of twenty centuries, it was difficult to\r\npersuade many persons to renounce the astronomical beliefs to which they\r\nwere so firmly attached, in favour of those of any other system; so that\r\nthe overthrow of this venerable theory required a lengthened period of\r\ntime for its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nIt was thus in his earlier years, when Milton devoted his time to the\r\nstudy of literature and philosophy, which he read extensively when\r\npursuing his academic career at Christ's College, Cambridge, and\r\nafterwards at Horton, where he spent several years in acquiring a more\r\nproficient knowledge of the literary, scientific, and philosophical\r\nwritings of the age, that he found the beliefs associated with the\r\nPtolemaic theory adopted without doubt or hesitation by the numerous\r\nauthors whose works he perused. His knowledge of Italian enabled him to\r\nbecome familiar with Dante--one of his favourite authors, whose poetical\r\nwritings were deeply read by him, and who, in the elaboration of his\r\npoem, the 'Divina Commedia,' included the entire Ptolemaic cosmology.\r\n\r\nIn England the Copernican theory had few supporters, and the majority of\r\nthose who represented the intellect and learning of the country still\r\nretained their adherence to the old form of astronomical belief. We\r\ntherefore find that Milton followed the traditional way of thinking by\r\nadopting the views associated with the Ptolemaic theory.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Ptolemaic system, the Earth was regarded as the\r\nimmovable centre of the universe, and surrounding it were ten\r\ncrystalline spheres, or heavens, arranged in concentric circles, the\r\nlarger spheres enclosing the smaller ones; and within those was situated\r\nthe cosmos, or mundane universe, usually described as 'the Heavens and\r\nthe Earth.' To each of the first seven spheres there was attached a\r\nheavenly body, which was carried round the Earth by the revolution of\r\nthe crystalline.\r\n\r\n1st sphere: that of the Moon.\r\n\r\n2nd sphere: that of the planet Mercury.\r\n\r\n3rd sphere: that of the planet Venus.\r\n\r\n4th sphere: that of the Sun; regarded as a planet.\r\n\r\n5th sphere: that of the planet Mars.\r\n\r\n6th sphere: that of the planet Jupiter.\r\n\r\n7th sphere: that of the planet Saturn.\r\n\r\n8th sphere: that of the fixed stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nThe eighth sphere included all the fixed stars, and was called the\r\nfirmament, because it was believed to impart steadiness to the inner\r\nspheres, and, by its diurnal revolution, to carry them round the Earth,\r\ncausing the change of day and night.\r\n\r\nThe separate motions of the spheres, revolving with different\r\nvelocities, and at different angles to each other, accounted for the\r\nastronomical phenomena associated with the orbs attached to each.\r\nAccording to Ptolemy's scheme, the eighth sphere formed the outermost\r\nboundary of the universe; but later astronomers added to this system two\r\nother spheres--a _ninth_, called the _Crystalline_, which caused\r\nPrecession of the Equinoxes; and a _tenth_, called the _Primum Mobile_,\r\nor First Moved, which brought about the alternation of day and night, by\r\ncarrying all the other spheres round the Earth once in every twenty-four\r\nhours. The Primum Mobile enclosed, as if in a shell, all the other\r\nspheres, in which was included the created universe, and, although of\r\nvast dimensions, its conception did not overwhelm the mind in the same\r\nmanner that the effort to comprehend infinitude does.\r\n\r\nBeyond this last sphere there was believed to exist a boundless,\r\nuncircumscribed region, of immeasurable extent, called the Empyrean, or\r\nHeaven of Heavens, the incorruptible abode of the Deity, the place of\r\neternal mysteries, which the comprehension of man was unable to fathom,\r\nand of which it was impossible for his mind to form any conception. Such\r\nwere the imaginative beliefs upon which this ancient astronomical theory\r\nwas founded, that for a period of upwards of two thousand years held\r\nundisputed sway over the minds of men, and exercised during that time a\r\npredominating influence upon the imagination, thoughts, and conceptions\r\nof all those who devoted themselves to literature, science, and art. Of\r\nthe truthfulness of this assertion there is ample evidence in the\r\npoetical, philosophical, and historical writings of ancient authors,\r\nwhose ideas and conceptions regarding the created universe were limited\r\nand circumscribed by this form of astronomical belief. In the works of\r\nmore recent writers we find that it continued to assert its influence;\r\nand among our English poets, from Chaucer down to Shakespeare, there are\r\nnumerous references to the natural phenomena associated with this\r\nsystem, and most frequently expressed by poetical allusions to 'the\r\nmusic of the spheres.'\r\n\r\nThe ideas associated with the Ptolemaic theory were gratifying to the\r\npride and vanity of man, who could regard with complacency the paramount\r\nimportance of the globe which he inhabited, and of which he was the\r\nabsolute ruler, fixed in the centre of the universe, and surrounded by\r\nten revolving spheres, that carried along with them in their circuit all\r\nother celestial bodies--Sun, Moon, and stars, which would appear to have\r\nbeen created for his delectation, and for the purpose of ministering to\r\nhis requirements. But when the Copernican theory became better\r\nunderstood, and especially after the discovery of the law of universal\r\ngravitation, this venerable system of the universe, based upon a pile of\r\nunreasonable and false hypotheses, after an existence of over twenty\r\ncenturies, sank into oblivion, and was no more heard of.\r\n\r\nMilton's Ptolemaism is apparent in some of his shorter pieces, and also\r\nin his minor poems, 'Arcades' and 'Comus.' His 'Ode on the Nativity' is\r\nwritten in conformity with this belief, and the expression,\r\n\r\n    Ring out ye crystal spheres,\r\n\r\nindicates a poetical allusion to this theory. But as Milton grew older\r\nhis Ptolemaism became greatly modified, and there are good reasons for\r\nbelieving that in his latter years he renounced it entirely in favour of\r\nCopernicanism. When on his continental tour in 1638, he made the\r\nacquaintance of eminent men who held views different from those with\r\nwhich he was familiar; and in his interview with Galileo at Arcetri, the\r\naged astronomer may have impressed upon his mind the superiority of the\r\nCopernican theory, in accounting for the occurrence of celestial\r\nphenomena, as compared with the Ptolemaic.\r\n\r\nOn his return to England from the Continent, Milton took up his\r\nresidence in London, and lived in apartments in a house in St. Bride's\r\nChurchyard. Having no regular vocation, and not wishing to be dependent\r\nupon his father, he undertook the education of his two nephews, John and\r\nEdward Phillips, aged nine and ten years respectively. From St. Bride's\r\nChurchyard he removed to a larger house in Aldersgate, where he received\r\nas pupils the sons of some of his most intimate acquaintances. In the\r\nlist of subjects which Milton selected for the purpose of imparting\r\ninstruction to those youths he included astronomy and mathematics,\r\nwhich formed part of the curriculum of this educational establishment.\r\nThe text-book from which he taught his nephews and other pupils\r\nastronomy was called 'De Sphaera Mundi,' a work written by Joannes\r\nSacrobasco (John Holywood) in the thirteenth century. This book was an\r\nepitome of Ptolemy's 'Almagest,' and therefore entirely Ptolemaic in its\r\nteaching. It enjoyed great popularity during the Middle Ages, and is\r\nreported to have gone through as many as forty editions.\r\n\r\nThe selection of astronomy as one of the subjects in which Milton\r\ninstructed his pupils affords us evidence that he must have devoted\r\nconsiderable time and attention to acquiring a knowledge of the facts\r\nand details associated with the study of the science. In the attainment\r\nof this he had to depend upon his own exertions and the assistance\r\nderived from astronomical books; for at this time astronomy received no\r\nrecognition as a branch of study at any of the universities; and in\r\nBritain the science attracted less attention than on the Continent,\r\nwhere the genius of Kepler and Galileo elevated it to a position of\r\nnational importance.\r\n\r\nWe shall find as we proceed that Milton's knowledge of astronomy was\r\ncomprehensive and accurate; that he was familiar with the astronomical\r\nreasons by which many natural phenomena which occur around us can be\r\nexplained; and that he understood many of the details of the science\r\nwhich are unknown to ordinary observers of the heavens.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how largely astronomy enters into the composition of\r\n'Paradise Lost,' and we doubt if any author could have written such a\r\npoem without possessing a knowledge of the heavens and of the celestial\r\norbs such as can only be attained by a proficient and intimate\r\nacquaintance with this science.\r\n\r\nThe arguments in favour of or against the Ptolemaic and Copernican\r\ntheories were well known to Milton, even as regards their minute\r\ndetails; and in Book viii. he introduces a scientific discussion based\r\nupon the respective merits of those theories. The configuration of the\r\ncelestial and terrestrial spheres, and the great circles by which they\r\nare circumscribed, he also knew. The causes which bring about the change\r\nof the seasons; the obliquity of the ecliptic; the zodiacal\r\nconstellations through which the Sun travels, and the periods of the\r\nyear in which he occupies them, are embraced in Milton's knowledge of\r\nthe science of astronomy. The motions of the Earth, including the\r\nPrecession of the Equinoxes; the number and distinctive appearances of\r\nthe planets, their direct and retrograde courses, and their satellites,\r\nare also described by him. The constellations, and their relative\r\npositions on the celestial sphere; the principal stars, star-groups, and\r\nclusters, and the Galaxy, testify to Milton's knowledge of astronomy,\r\nand to the use which he has made of the science in the elaboration of\r\nhis poem.\r\n\r\nThe names of fourteen of the constellations are mentioned in 'Paradise\r\nLost.' These, when arranged alphabetically, read as follows:--\r\n\r\nAndromeda, Aries, Astrea, Centaurus, Cancer, Capricornus, Gemini, Leo,\r\nLibra, Ophiuchus, Orion, Scorpio, Taurus, and Virgo. Milton's allusions\r\nto the zodiacal constellations are chiefly associated with his\r\ndescription of the Sun's path in the heavens; but with the celestial\r\nsign Libra (the _Scales_) he has introduced a lofty and poetical\r\nconception of the means by which the Creator made known His will when\r\nthere arose a contention between Gabriel and Satan on his discovery in\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\n    The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,\r\n    Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen\r\n    Betwixt Astrea[6] and the Scorpion sign,\r\n    Wherein all things created first he weighed,\r\n    The pendulous round Earth with balanced air\r\n    In counterpoise, now ponders all events,\r\n    Battles and realms. In these he put two weights,\r\n    The sequel each of parting and of fight:\r\n    The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam.--iv. 996-1004.\r\n\r\nOrion, the finest constellation in the heavens, did not escape Milton's\r\nobservation, and there is one allusion to it in his poem. It arrives on\r\nthe meridian in winter, where it is conspicuous as a brilliant\r\nassemblage of stars, and represents an armed giant, or hunter, holding a\r\nmassive club in his right hand, and having a shield of lion's hide on\r\nhis left arm. A triple-gemmed belt encircles his waist, from which is\r\nsuspended a glittering sword, tipped with a bright star. The two\r\nbrilliants Betelgeux and Bellatrix form the giant's shoulders, and the\r\nbright star Rigel marks the position of his advanced foot. The rising of\r\nOrion was believed to be accompanied by stormy and tempestuous weather.\r\nMilton alludes to this in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n          When with fierce winds Orion armed\r\n    Hath vexed the Red Sea coast, whose waves o'erthrew\r\n    Busiris and his Memphian chivalry.--i. 305-7.\r\n\r\nAndromeda is described as being borne by Aries, and in 'Ophiuchus huge'\r\nMilton locates a comet which extends the whole length of the\r\nconstellation. It is evident that Milton possessed a precise knowledge\r\nof the configuration and size of the constellations, and of the\r\npositions which they occupy relatively to each other on the celestial\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nThough Milton was conversant with the Copernican theory, and entertained\r\na conviction of its accuracy and truthfulness, and doubtless recognised\r\nthe superiority of this system, which, besides conveying to the mind a\r\nnobler conception of the universe and of the solar system--though it\r\ndiminished the importance of the Earth as a member of it--was capable of\r\nexplaining the occurrence of celestial phenomena in a manner more\r\nsatisfactory than could be arrived at by the Ptolemaic theory.\r\nNotwithstanding this, he selected the Ptolemaic cosmology as the\r\nscientific basis upon which he constructed his 'Paradise Lost,' and in\r\nits elaboration adhered with marked fidelity to this system. There were\r\nmany reasons why Milton, in the composition of an imaginative poem,\r\nshould have chosen the Ptolemaic system of the universe rather than the\r\nCopernican. This form of astronomical belief was adopted by all the\r\nauthors whose works he perused and studied in his younger days,\r\nincluding his favourite poet, Dante; and his own poetic imaginings, as\r\nindicated by his early poems, were in harmony with the doctrines of this\r\nastronomical creed, a long acquaintance with which had, without doubt,\r\ninfluenced his mind in its favour. This system of revolving spheres,\r\nwith the steadfast Earth at its centre, and the whole enclosed by the\r\nPrimum Mobile, constituted a more attractive and picturesque object for\r\npoetic description than the simple and uncircumscribed arrangement of\r\nthe universe expressed by the Copernican theory. It also afforded him an\r\nopportunity of localising those regions of space in which the chief\r\nincidents in his poem are described--viz. HEAVEN, or THE EMPYREAN,\r\nCHAOS, HELL, and the MUNDANE UNIVERSE. Milton's Ptolemaism, with its\r\nadjuncts, may be understood by the following:\r\n\r\nAll that portion of space above the newly created universe, and beyond\r\nthe Primum Mobile, was known as HEAVEN, or THE EMPYREAN--a region of\r\nlight, of glory, and of happiness; the dwelling-place of the Deity, Who,\r\nthough omnipresent, here visibly revealed Himself to all the multitude\r\nof angels whom He created, and who surrounded his throne in adoration\r\nand worship.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the universe there existed a vast region of similar\r\ndimensions to the Empyrean, called CHAOS, which was occupied by the\r\nembryo elements of matter, that with incessant turmoil and confusion\r\nwarred with each other for supremacy--a wild abyss--\r\n\r\n    The womb of Nature and perhaps her grave.--ii. 911.\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of this region was divided off from the remainder, and\r\nembraced the locality known as HELL--the place of torment, where the\r\nrebellious angels were driven and shut in after their expulsion from\r\nHeaven.\r\n\r\n    As far removed from God and light of Heaven\r\n    As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.--i. 73-74.\r\n\r\nThe NEW UNIVERSE, which included the Earth and all the orbs of the\r\nfirmament known as the Starry Heavens, was created out of Chaos, and\r\nhung, as if suspended by a golden chain, from the Empyrean above; and\r\nalthough its magnitude and dimensions were inconceivable, yet, according\r\nto the Ptolemaic theory, it was enclosed by the tenth sphere or Primum\r\nMobile.\r\n\r\nBy this partitioning of space Milton was able to contrive a system which\r\nfulfilled the requirements of his great poem.\r\n\r\nThe annexed diagram explains the relative positions of the different\r\nregions into which space was divided.\r\n\r\nThough there are traces of Copernicanism found in 'Paradise Lost,' yet\r\nMilton has very faithfully adhered to the Ptolemaic mechanism and\r\nnomenclature throughout his poem.\r\n\r\nIn his description of the Creation, the Earth is formed first, then the\r\nSun, followed by the Moon, and afterwards the stars, all of which are\r\ndescribed as being in motion round the Earth. Allusion is also made to\r\nthis ancient system in several prominent passages, and in the following\r\nlines there is a distinct reference to the various revolving spheres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2]\r\n\r\n    They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,\r\n    And that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs\r\n    The trepidation talked, and that first moved.--iii. 481-83.\r\n\r\nThe seven planetary spheres are first mentioned; then the eighth sphere,\r\nor that of the fixed stars; then the ninth, or crystalline, which was\r\nbelieved to cause a shaking, or trepidation, to account for certain\r\nirregularities in the motions of the stars; and, lastly, the tenth\r\nsphere, or Primum Mobile, called the 'first moved' because it set the\r\nother spheres in motion.\r\n\r\nTo an uninstructed observer, the apparent motion of the heavenly bodies\r\nround the Earth would naturally lead him to conclude that, of the two\r\ntheories, the Ptolemaic was the correct one. We therefore find that\r\nMilton adopted the system most in accord with the knowledge and\r\nintelligence possessed by the persons portrayed by him in his poem; and\r\nin describing the natural phenomena witnessed in the heavens by our\r\nfirst parents, he adheres to the doctrines of the Ptolemaic system, as\r\nbeing most in harmony with the simple and primitive conceptions of those\r\ncreated beings.\r\n\r\nTo their upward gaze, the orbs of heaven appeared to be in ceaseless\r\nmotion; the solid Earth, upon which they stood, was alone immovable and\r\nat rest. Day after day they observed the Sun pursue his steadfast course\r\nwith unerring regularity: his rising in the east, accompanied by the\r\nrosy hues of morn; his meridian splendour, and his sinking in the west,\r\ntinting in colours of purple and gold inimitable the fleecy clouds\r\nfloating in the azure sky, as he bids farewell for a time to scenes of\r\nlife and happiness, rejoicing in the light and warmth of his\r\nall-cheering beams. With the advent of night they beheld the Moon, now\r\nincreasing, now waning, pursue her irregular path, also to disappear in\r\nthe west; whilst, like the bands of an army marshalled in loose array,\r\nthe constellations of glittering stars, with stately motion, traversed\r\ntheir nocturnal arcs, circling the pole of the heavens.\r\n\r\nBy referring to Book viii., 15-175, we find an account of an interesting\r\nscientific discussion, or conversation, between Adam and Raphael\r\nregarding the merits of the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems, and of the\r\nrelative importance and size of the heavenly bodies. By it we are\r\nafforded an opportunity of learning how accurate and precise a knowledge\r\nMilton possessed of both theories, and in what clear and perspicuous\r\nlanguage he expresses his arguments in favour of or against the\r\ndoctrines associated with each.\r\n\r\nWe may, with good reason, regard the views expressed by Adam as\r\nrepresenting Milton's own opinions, which were in conformity with the\r\nCopernican theory; and in the Angel's reply, though of an undecided\r\ncharacter, we are able to perceive how aptly Milton describes the\r\nerroneous conclusions upon which the Ptolemaic theory was based.\r\n\r\nIn this scientific discussion, it would seem rather strange that Adam,\r\nthe first of men, should have been capable of such philosophic\r\nreasoning, propounding, as if by intuition, a theory upon which was\r\nfounded a system that had not been discovered until many centuries after\r\nthe time that astronomy became a science. By attributing to Adam such a\r\ndegree of intelligence and wisdom, the poet has taken a liberty which\r\nenabled him to carry on this discussion in a manner befitting the\r\nimportance of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the following lines Adam expresses to his Angel-guest, in forcible\r\nand convincing language, his reasons in support of the Copernican\r\ntheory:--\r\n\r\n    When I behold this goodly frame, this World,\r\n    Of Heaven and Earth consisting, and compute\r\n    Their magnitudes--this Earth, a spot, a grain,\r\n    An atom, with the Firmament compared\r\n    And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll\r\n    Spaces incomprehensible (for such\r\n    Their distance argues, and their swift return\r\n    Diurnal) merely to officiate light\r\n    Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,\r\n    One day and night, in all her vast survey\r\n    Useless besides--reasoning, I oft admire,\r\n    How Nature, wise and frugal could commit\r\n    Such disproportions, with superfluous hand\r\n    So many nobler bodies to create,\r\n    Greater so manifold, to this one use,\r\n    For aught appears, and on their Orbs impose\r\n    Such restless revolution day by day\r\n    Repeated, while the sedentary Earth,\r\n    That better might with far less compass move,\r\n    Served by more noble than herself, attains\r\n    Her end without least motion, and receives,\r\n    As tribute, such a sumless journey brought\r\n    Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light;\r\n    Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails.--viii. 15-38.\r\n\r\nWe are enabled to perceive that Milton had formed a correct conception\r\nof the magnitude and proportions of the universe, and also of the\r\nrelative size and importance of the Earth, which he describes as 'a\r\nspot, a grain, an atom,' when compared with the surrounding heavens. He\r\nexpresses his surprise that all the stars of the firmament, whose\r\ndistances are so remote, and whose dimensions so greatly exceed those of\r\nthis globe, should in their diurnal revolution have 'such a sumless\r\njourney of incorporeal speed imposed upon them' merely to officiate\r\nlight to the Earth, 'this punctual spot;' and reasoning, wonders how\r\nNature, wise and frugal in her ways, should commit such disproportions,\r\nby adopting means so great to accomplish a result so small, when motion\r\nimparted to the sedentary Earth would with greater ease produce the same\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe inconceivable velocity with which it would be necessary for those\r\norbs to travel in order to accomplish a daily revolution round the Earth\r\nmight be described as almost spiritual, and beyond the power of\r\ncalculation by numbers.\r\n\r\nThe Angel, after listening to Adam's argument, expresses approval of his\r\ndesire to obtain knowledge, but answers him dubiously, and at the same\r\ntime criticises in a severe and adverse manner the Ptolemaic theory.\r\n\r\n    To ask or search I blame thee not; for Heaven\r\n    Is as the Book of God before thee set,\r\n    Wherein to read his wondrous works, and learn\r\n    His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years.\r\n    This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,\r\n    Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest\r\n    From Man or Angel the Great Architect\r\n    Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge\r\n    His secrets, to be scanned by them who ought\r\n    Rather admire. Or, if they list to try\r\n    Conjecture, he his fabric of the Heavens\r\n    Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move\r\n    His laughter at their quaint opinions wide\r\n    Hereafter, when they come to model Heaven,\r\n    And calculate the stars; how they will wield\r\n    The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive\r\n    To save appearances; how gird the Sphere\r\n    With Centric and Eccentric scribbled o'er\r\n    Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb.--viii. 66-84.\r\n\r\nWhen, with the advancement of science, astronomical observations were\r\nmade with greater accuracy, it was discovered that uniformity of motion\r\nwas not always maintained by those bodies which were believed to move in\r\ncircles round the Earth. It was observed that the Sun, when on one side\r\nof his orbit, had an accelerated motion, as compared with the speed at\r\nwhich he travelled when on the other side. The planets, also, appeared\r\nto move with irregularity: sometimes a planet was observed to advance,\r\nthen become stationary, and afterwards affect a retrograde movement.\r\nThose inequalities of motion could not be explained by means of the\r\nrevolution of crystalline spheres alone, but were accounted for by\r\nimagining the existence of a small circle, or epicycle, whose centre\r\ncorresponded with a fixed point in the larger circle, or eccentric, as\r\nit was called. This small circle revolved on its axis when carried round\r\nwith the larger one, and round it the planet also revolved, which when\r\nsituated in its outer portion would have a forward, and when in its\r\ninner portion a retrograde, motion.\r\n\r\nThe theory of eccentrics and epicycles was sufficient for a time to\r\naccount for the inequalities of motion already described, and by this\r\nmeans the Ptolemaic system was enabled to retain its ascendency for a\r\nlonger period than it otherwise would have done. But more recent\r\ndiscoveries brought to light discrepancies and difficulties which were\r\nexplained away by adding epicycle to epicycle. This created a most\r\ncomplicated entanglement, and hastened the downfall of a system which,\r\nafter an existence of many centuries, sank into oblivion, and is now\r\nremembered as a belief of bygone ages.\r\n\r\nThe devices which the upholders of this system were compelled to adopt,\r\nin order 'to save appearances,' with 'centric and eccentric,' cycle and\r\nepicycle, 'orb in orb,' are in this manner appropriately described by\r\nMilton, as indicating the confusion arising from a theory based upon\r\nfalse hypotheses.\r\n\r\nContinuing his reply, the Angel says:--\r\n\r\n    Already by thy reasoning this I guess,\r\n    Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest\r\n    That bodies bright and greater should not serve\r\n    The less not bright, nor Heaven such journies run,\r\n    Earth sitting still, when she alone receives\r\n    The benefit. Consider, first, that great\r\n    Or bright infers not excellence. The Earth,\r\n    Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,\r\n    Nor glistering, may of solid good contain\r\n    More plenty than the Sun that barren shines,\r\n    Whose virtue on itself works no effect,\r\n    But in the fruitful Earth; there first received,\r\n    His beams, inactive else, their vigour find,\r\n    Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries\r\n    Officious, but to thee, Earth's habitant.\r\n    And, for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak\r\n    The Maker's high magnificence, who built\r\n    So spacious, and his line stretched out so far,\r\n    That Man may know he dwells not in his own--\r\n    An edifice too large for him to fill,\r\n    Lodged in a small partition; and the rest\r\n    Ordained for uses to his Lord best known,\r\n    The swiftness of those Circles attribute,\r\n    Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,\r\n    That to corporeal substances could add\r\n    Speed almost spiritual. Me thou think'st not slow,\r\n    Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven\r\n    Where God resides, and ere midday arrived\r\n    In Eden--distance inexpressible\r\n    By numbers that have name. But this I urge,\r\n    Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show\r\n    Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;\r\n    Not that I so affirm, though so it seem\r\n    To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.\r\n    God, to remove his ways from human sense,\r\n    Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,\r\n    If it presume, might err in things too high,\r\n    And no advantage gain.--viii. 85-122.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the Angel's severe criticism of the Ptolemaic system, he\r\ndoes not unreservedly support the conclusions arrived at by Adam, but\r\nendeavours to show that his reasoning may not be altogether correct. He\r\nquestions the validity of his argument that bodies of greater size and\r\nbrightness should not serve the smaller, though not bright, and that\r\nheaven should move, while the Earth remained at rest. He argues that\r\ngreat or bright infers not excellence, and that the Earth, though small,\r\nmay contain more virtue than the Sun, that 'barren shines,' whose beams\r\ncreate no beneficial effect, except when directed on the fruitful\r\nEarth. He reminds Adam that those bright luminaries minister not to the\r\nEarth, but to himself, 'Earth's habitant,' and directs his attention to\r\nthe magnificence and extent of the surrounding universe, of which he\r\noccupies but a small portion. The diurnal swiftness of the orbs that\r\nmove round the Earth he attributes to God's omnipotence, that to\r\nmaterial bodies 'could add speed almost spiritual.'\r\n\r\nThe Angel, after alluding to his rapid flight through space, suggests\r\nthat God placed heaven so far from Earth that man might not presume to\r\ninquire into things which it would be of no advantage for him to know.\r\nHe then suddenly changes to the Copernican system, which he lucidly\r\ndescribes in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n                              What if the Sun\r\n    Be centre to the World, and other stars\r\n    By his attractive virtue and their own\r\n    Incited, dance about him various rounds?\r\n    Their wandering course, now high, now low, then hid,\r\n    Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,\r\n    In six thou seest; and what if, seventh to these\r\n    The planet Earth, so steadfast though she seem,\r\n    Insensibly three different motions move?\r\n    Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,\r\n    Moved contrary with thwart obliquities,\r\n    Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift\r\n    Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed\r\n    Invisible else above all stars, the wheel\r\n    Of day and night; which needs not thy belief,\r\n    If Earth, industrious of herself, fetch day\r\n    Travelling east, and with her part averse\r\n    From the Sun's beam meet night, her other part\r\n    Still luminous by his ray. What if that light,\r\n    Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,\r\n    To the terrestrial Moon be as a star,\r\n    Enlightening her by day, as she by night\r\n    This Earth--reciprocal, if land be there,\r\n    Fields and inhabitants? Her spots thou seest\r\n    As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce\r\n    Fruits in her softened soil, for some to eat\r\n    Allotted there; and other Suns, perhaps,\r\n    With their attendant Moons, thou wilt descry,\r\n    Communicating male and female light--\r\n    Which two great sexes animate the World,\r\n    Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.\r\n    For such vast room in Nature unpossessed\r\n    By living soul, desert and desolate,\r\n    Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute\r\n    Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far\r\n    Down to this habitable, which returns\r\n    Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.--viii. 122-58.\r\n\r\nThe Copernican theory, which is less complicated and more easily\r\nunderstood than the Ptolemaic, is described by Milton with accuracy and\r\nmethodical skill.\r\n\r\nThe Sun having been assigned that central position in the system which\r\nhis magnitude and importance claim as his due, the planets circling in\r\norbits around him have their motions described in a manner indicative of\r\nthe precise knowledge which Milton acquired of this theory. At this time\r\nthe law of gravitation was unknown, and, although the ellipticity of the\r\norbits of the planets had been discovered by Kepler, the nature of the\r\nmotive force which guided and retained them in their paths still\r\nremained a mystery. It was believed that the planets were whirled round\r\nthe Sun, as if by the action of magnetic fibres; a mutual attractive\r\ninfluence having been supposed to exist between them and the orb,\r\nsimilar to that of the opposite poles of magnets.\r\n\r\nMilton alludes to this theory in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n                            They, as they move\r\n    Their starry dance in numbers that compute\r\n    Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp\r\n    Turn swift their various motions, or are turned\r\n    By his magnetic beam.--iii. 579-83.\r\n\r\nAn important advance upon this theory was made by Horrox, who, in his\r\nstudy of celestial dynamics, attributed the curvilineal motion of the\r\nplanets to the influence of two forces, one projective, the other\r\nattractive. He illustrated this by observing the path described by a\r\nstone when thrown obliquely into the air. He perceived that its motion\r\nwas governed by the impulse imparted to it by the hand, and also by the\r\nattractive force of the Earth. Under these two influences, the stone\r\ndescribes a graceful curve, and in its descent falls at the same angle\r\nat which it rose. Hence arises the general law: 'When two spheres are\r\nmutually attracted, and if not prevented by foreign influences, their\r\nstraight paths are deflected into curves concave to each other, and\r\ncorresponding with one of the sections of a cone, according to the\r\nvelocity of the revolving body. If the velocity with which the revolving\r\nbody is impelled be equal to what it would acquire by falling through\r\nhalf the radius of a circle described from the centre of deflection, its\r\norbit will be circular; but if it be less than that quantity, its path\r\nbecomes elliptical.'\r\n\r\nNewton afterwards embraced this law in his great principle of\r\ngravitation, and demonstrated that the force which guides and retains\r\nthe Earth and planets in their orbits resides in the Sun. By the orb's\r\nattractive influence a planet, after having received its first impulse,\r\nis deflected from its original straight path, and bent towards that\r\nluminary, and by the combined action of the projective and attractive\r\nforces is made to describe an orbit which, if elliptical, has one of its\r\nfoci occupied by the Sun. So evenly balanced are those two forces, that\r\none is unable to gain any permanent ascendency over the other, and\r\nconsequently the planet traverses its orbit with unerring regularity,\r\nand, if undisturbed by external influences, will continue in its path\r\nfor all time.\r\n\r\nMilton describes the position of the planets in the sky as--\r\n\r\n    Now high, now low, then hid;\r\n\r\nand their motions--\r\n\r\n    Progressive, retrograde, or standing still.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Milton was familiar with the apparently irregular\r\npaths pursued by the planets when observed from the Earth. He knew of\r\ntheir stationary points, and also the backward loopings traced out by\r\nthem on the surface of the sphere.\r\n\r\nIf observed from the Sun, all the planets would be seen to follow their\r\ntrue paths round that body; their motion would invariably lie in the\r\nsame direction, and any variation in their speed as they approached\r\nperihelion or aphelion would be real. But the planets, when observed\r\nfrom the Earth, which is itself in motion, appear to move irregularly.\r\nSometimes they remain stationary for a brief period, and, instead of\r\nprogressing onward, affect a retrograde movement. This irregularity of\r\nmotion is only apparent, and can be explained as a result of the\r\ncombined motions of the Earth and planets, which are travelling together\r\nround the Sun with different velocities, and in orbits of unequal\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nIn his allusion to the Copernican system the 'planet' 'Earth' is\r\ndescribed by Milton as seventh. This is not strictly accurate, as only\r\nfive planets were known--viz. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn;\r\nbut to make up the number Milton has included the Moon, which may be\r\nregarded as the Earth's planet.\r\n\r\nThe three motions ascribed to the Earth are--(1) The diurnal rotation on\r\nher axis; (2) her annual revolution round the Sun; (3) Precession of the\r\nEquinoxes.\r\n\r\nThe rotation of the Earth on her axis may be likened to the spinning\r\nmotion of a top, and is the cause of the alternation of day and night.\r\nThis rotatory motion is sustained with such exact precision that, during\r\nthe past 2,000 years, it has been impossible to detect the minutest\r\ndifference in the time in which the Earth accomplishes a revolution on\r\nher axis, and therefore the length of the sidereal day, which is 3\r\nminutes 56 seconds shorter than the mean solar day, is invariable. In\r\nthis motion of the Earth we have a time-measuring unit which may be\r\nregarded as absolutely correct.\r\n\r\nThe Earth completes a revolution of her orbit in 365-1/4 days. In this\r\nperiod of time she accomplishes a journey of 580 millions of miles,\r\ntravelling at the average rate of 66,000 miles an hour. The change of\r\nthe seasons, and the lengthening and shortening of the day, are natural\r\nphenomena, which occur as a consequence of the Earth's annual revolution\r\nround the Sun. Precession is a retrograde or westerly motion of the\r\nequinoctial points, caused by the attraction of the Sun, Moon, and\r\nplanets on the spheroidal figure of the Earth. By this movement the\r\npoles of the Earth are made to describe a circular path in that part of\r\nthe heavens to which they point; so that, after the lapse of many years,\r\nthe star which is known as the Pole Star will not occupy the position\r\nindicated by its name, but will be situated at a considerable distance\r\nfrom the pole. These motions, Milton says, unless attributed to the\r\nEarth, must be ascribed to several spheres crossing and thwarting each\r\nother obliquely; but the Earth, by rotating from west to east, will of\r\nherself fetch day, her other half, averted from the Sun's rays, being\r\nenveloped in night. Thus saving the Sun his labour, and the 'primum\r\nmobile,' 'that swift nocturnal and diurnal rhomb,' which carried all the\r\nlower spheres along with it, and brought about the change of day and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nMilton's allusion to the occurrence of natural phenomena in the Moon\r\nsimilar to those which happen on the Earth is in keeping with the\r\nopinions entertained regarding our satellite, Galileo having imagined\r\nthat he discovered with his telescope continents and seas on the lunar\r\nsurface, which led to the belief that the Moon was the abode of\r\nintelligent life.\r\n\r\n    ... and other suns, perhaps,\r\n    With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry\r\n    Communicating male and female light.--viii. 148-50.\r\n\r\nMilton in these lines refers to Jupiter and Saturn, and their\r\nsatellites, which had been recently discovered; those of the former by\r\nGalileo, and four of those of the latter by Cassini. The existence of\r\nmale and female light was an idea entertained by the ancients, and which\r\nis mentioned by Pliny. The Sun was regarded as a masculine star, and the\r\nMoon as feminine; the light emanating from each being similarly\r\ndistinguished, and possessing different properties.\r\n\r\nMilton supposes that, as the Earth receives light from the stars, she\r\nreturns light back to them. But in his time little was known about the\r\nstars, nor was it ascertained how distant they are.\r\n\r\nThe Angel, in bringing to a conclusion his conversation with Adam, deems\r\nit unadvisable to vouchsafe him a decisive reply to his inquiry\r\nregarding the motions of celestial bodies, and in the following lines\r\ngives a beautifully poetical summary of this elevated and philosophic\r\ndiscussion:--\r\n\r\n    But whether thus these things, or whether not,\r\n    Whether the Sun, predominant in Heaven,\r\n    Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun;\r\n    He from the east his flaming round begin,\r\n    Or she from west her silent course advance\r\n    With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps\r\n    On her soft axle, whilst she paces even,\r\n    And bears thee soft with the smooth air along--\r\n    Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid.--viii. 159-67.\r\n\r\nIn this scientific discourse between Adam and Raphael, in which they\r\ndiscuss the structural arrangement of the heavens and the motions of\r\ncelestial bodies, we are afforded an opportunity of learning what exact\r\nand comprehensive knowledge Milton possessed of both the Ptolemaic and\r\nCopernican theories. The concise and accurate manner in which he\r\ndescribes the doctrines belonging to each system indicates that he must\r\nhave devoted considerable time and attention to making himself master of\r\nthe details associated with both theories, which in his time were the\r\ncause of much controversy and discussion among philosophers and men of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nThe Ptolemaic system, with its crystalline spheres revolving round the\r\nEarth, the addition to those of cycles and epicycles, and the heaping of\r\nthem upon each other, in order to account for phenomena associated with\r\nthe motions of celestial bodies, are concisely and accurately described.\r\n\r\nThe unreasonableness of this theory, when compared with the Copernican,\r\nis clearly delineated by Milton where Adam is made to express his views\r\nwith regard to motion in the heavens. His argument, declared in logical\r\nand persuasive language, demonstrates how contrary to reason it would be\r\nto imagine that the entire heavens should revolve round the Earth to\r\nbring about a result which could be more easily attained by imparting\r\nmotion to the Earth herself. The inconceivable velocity with which it\r\nwould be necessary for the celestial orbs to travel in order to\r\naccomplish their daily revolution is described by him as opposed to all\r\nreason, and entailing upon them a journey which it would be impossible\r\nfor material bodies to perform. None the less accurate is Milton's\r\ndescription of the Copernican system. He describes the Sun as occupying\r\nthat position in the system which his magnitude and supreme importance\r\nclaim as his sole right, having the planets with their satellites,\r\n\r\n    That from his lordly eye keep distance due.--iii. 578,\r\n\r\ncircling in majestic orbits around him, acknowledging his controlling\r\npower, and bending to his firm but gentle sway. Their positions, their\r\npaths, and their motions, real and apparent, are described in flowing\r\nand harmonious verse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMILTON AND GALILEO\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his mother, which occurred in 1637, Milton expressed\r\na desire to visit the Continent, where there were many places of\r\ninterest which he often longed to see. Having obtained the consent of\r\nhis kind and indulgent father, he set out on his travels in April 1638,\r\naccompanied by a single man-servant, and arrived in Paris, where he only\r\nstayed a few days. During his residence in the French capital he was\r\nintroduced by Lord Scudamore, the English Ambassador at the Court of\r\nVersailles, to Hugo Grotius, one of the most distinguished scholars and\r\nphilosophic thinkers of his age. From Paris Milton journeyed to Nice,\r\nwhere he first beheld the beauty of Italian scenery and the classic\r\nshores of the Mediterranean Sea. From Nice he sailed to Genoa and\r\nLeghorn, and after a short stay at those places continued his journey to\r\nFlorence, one of the most interesting and picturesque of Italian cities.\r\nSituated in the Valley of the Arno, and encircled by sloping hills\r\ncovered with luxuriant vegetation, the sides of which were studded with\r\nresidences half-hidden among the foliage of gardens and vineyards,\r\nFlorence, besides being famed for its natural beauty, was at that time\r\nthe centre of Italian culture and learning, and the abode of men eminent\r\nin literature and science. Here Milton remained for a period of two\r\nmonths, and enjoyed the friendship and hospitality of its most noted\r\ncitizens, many of whom delighted to honour their English visitor. He was\r\nwarmly welcomed by the members of the various literary academies, who\r\nadmired his compositions and conversation; the flattering encomiums\r\nbestowed upon him by those learned societies having been amply repaid by\r\nMilton in choice and elegant Latin verse.\r\n\r\nAmong those who resided in the vicinity of Florence was the illustrious\r\nGalileo, who in his sorrow-stricken old age was held a prisoner of the\r\nInquisition for having upheld and taught scientific doctrines which were\r\ndeclared to be heretical. After his abjuration he was committed to\r\nprison, but on the intervention of influential friends was released\r\nafter a few days' incarceration, and permitted to return to his home at\r\nArcetri. He was, however, kept under strict surveillance, and forbidden\r\nto leave his house or receive any of his intimate friends without having\r\nfirst obtained the sanction of the ecclesiastical authorities. After\r\nseveral years of close confinement at Arcetri, during which time he\r\nsuffered much from rheumatism and continued ill-health, aggravated by\r\ngrief and mental depression consequent upon the death of his favourite\r\ndaughter, Galileo applied for permission to go to Florence in order to\r\nplace himself under medical treatment. This request was granted by the\r\nPope subject to certain conditions, which would be communicated to him\r\nwhen he presented himself at the office of the Inquisition at Florence.\r\nThese were more severe than he anticipated. He was forbidden to leave\r\nhis house or receive any of his friends there, and those injunctions\r\nwere so strictly adhered to that during Passion Week he had to obtain a\r\nspecial order so that he might be able to attend mass. At the expiration\r\nof a few months Galileo was ordered to return to Arcetri, which he never\r\nleft again.\r\n\r\nAn affliction, perhaps the most deplorable that can happen to any human\r\nbeing, was added to the burden of Galileo's misfortunes and woes. A\r\ndisorder which had some years previously injured the sight of his right\r\neye returned in 1636. In the following year the left eye became\r\nsimilarly affected, with the result that in a few months Galileo became\r\ntotally blind. His friends at first hoped that the disease was cataract,\r\nand that some relief might be afforded by means of an operation; but it\r\nwas discovered to be an opacity of the cornea, which at his age was\r\nconsidered unamenable to treatment. This sudden and unexpected calamity\r\nwas to Galileo a most deplorable occurrence, for it necessitated the\r\nrelinquishment of his favourite pursuit, which he followed with such\r\nintense interest and delight. His friend Castelli writes: 'The noblest\r\neye is darkened which Nature ever made; an eye so privileged, and gifted\r\nwith such rare qualities that it may with truth be said to have seen\r\nmore than all of those eyes who are gone, and to have opened the eyes of\r\nall who are to come.' Galileo endured his affliction with patient\r\nresignation and fortitude, and in the following extract from a letter by\r\nhim he acknowledges the chastening hand of a Divine Providence: 'Alas!\r\nyour dear friend and servant Galileo has become totally blind, so that\r\nthis heaven, this earth, this universe, which with wonderful\r\nobservations I had enlarged a hundred and a thousand times beyond the\r\nbelief of bygone ages, henceforward for me is shrunk into the narrow\r\nspace which I myself fill in it. So it pleases God; it shall then please\r\nme also.' The rigorous curtailment of his liberty which prompted Galileo\r\nto head his letters, 'From my prison at Arcetri,' was relaxed when total\r\nblindness had supervened upon the infirmities of age. Permission was\r\ngiven him to receive his friends, and he was allowed to have free\r\nintercourse with his neighbours.\r\n\r\nMilton, during his stay at Florence, visited Galileo at Arcetri. We are\r\nignorant of the details of this eventful and interesting interview\r\nbetween the aged and blind astronomer and the young English poet, who\r\nafterwards immortalised his name in heroic verse, and who in his\r\ndeclining years suffered from an affliction similar to that which befel\r\nGalileo, and to which he alludes so pathetically in the following\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n                          Thee I revisit safe,\r\n    And feel thy sovran vital lamp; but thou\r\n    Revisitest not these eyes, that roll in vain\r\n    To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;\r\n    So thick a drop serene hath quenched their orbs,\r\n    Or dim suffusion veiled.--iii. 21-26.\r\n\r\nWe can imagine that Galileo's astronomical views, which at that time\r\nwere the subject of much discussion among scientific men and professors\r\nof religion, and on account of which he suffered persecution, were\r\neagerly discussed. It is also probable that the information communicated\r\nby Galileo, or by some of his followers, may have persuaded Milton to\r\nentertain a more favourable opinion of the Copernican theory. The\r\ninteresting discoveries made by Galileo with his telescope without doubt\r\nformed a pleasant subject of conversation, and Milton enjoyed the\r\nprivilege of listening to a detailed description of these from the lips\r\nof the aged astronomer. The telescope, its principle, its mechanism, and\r\nthe method of observing, were most probably explained to him; and we can\r\nbelieve that an opportunity was afforded him of examining those in\r\nGalileo's observatory, and of perhaps testing their magnifying power\r\nupon some celestial object favourably situated for observation. Though\r\nMilton has not favoured us with any details of his visit to Galileo, yet\r\nit was one which made a lasting impression upon his mind, and was never\r\nafterwards forgotten by him. 'There it was,' he writes, 'I found and\r\nvisited the famous Galileo, grown old, a prisoner of the Inquisition for\r\nthinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican\r\nlicensers thought.' In years long after, when Milton, himself feeble\r\nand blind, sat down to compose his 'Paradise Lost,' the remembrance of\r\nthe Tuscan artist and his telescope was still fresh in his memory.\r\n\r\nBy the invention of the telescope and its application to astronomical\r\nresearch, a vast amount of information and additional detail have been\r\nlearned regarding the bodies which enter into the formation of the solar\r\nsystem; and by its aid many new ones were also discovered. On sweeping\r\nthe heavens with the instrument, the illimitable extent of the sidereal\r\nuniverse became apparent, and numberless objects of interest were\r\nbrought within the range of vision the existence of which had not been\r\npreviously imagined.\r\n\r\nThe Galilean telescope was invented in 1609. But the magnifying power of\r\ncertain lenses, and their combination in producing singular visual\r\neffects, are alluded to in the writings of several early authors. The\r\nvalue of single lenses as an aid to sight had been long known, and\r\nspectacles were in common use in the fourteenth century. Several\r\nmathematicians have described the wonderful optical results obtained\r\nfrom glasses concave and convex, of parabolic and circular forms, and\r\nfrom 'perspective glasses,' in which were embodied the principle of the\r\ntelescope. It is asserted that our countryman, Roger Bacon (1214), had\r\nsome notion of the properties of the telescope; but among those familiar\r\nwith the combination of lenses the two men who made the nearest approach\r\nto the invention of the instrument were Baptista Porta and Gerolamo\r\nFracastro. The latter, who died in 1553, writes as follows: 'For which\r\nreason those things which are seen at the bottom of water appear greater\r\nthan those which are at the top; and if anyone look through two\r\neye-glasses, one placed upon the other, he will see everything much\r\nlarger and nearer.' It is doubtful if Fracastro had any notion of\r\nconstructing a mechanism which might answer the purpose of a telescopic\r\ntube. Baptista Porta (1611) is more explicit in what he describes. He\r\nwrites: 'Concave lenses show distant objects most clearly, convex those\r\nwhich are nearer; whence they may be used to assist the sight. With a\r\nconcave glass distant objects will be seen, small, but distinct; with a\r\nconvex one, those near at hand, larger, but confused; if you know\r\n_rightly_ how to combine one of each sort, you will see both far and\r\nnear objects larger and clearer.' He then goes on to say: 'I shall now\r\nendeavour to show in what manner we may continue to recognise our\r\nfriends at the distance of several miles, and how those of weak sight\r\nmay read the most minute letters from a distance. It is an invention of\r\ngreat utility, and grounded on optical principles; nor is at all\r\ndifficult of execution; but it must be so divulged as not to be\r\nunderstood by the vulgar, and yet be clear to the sharp-sighted.' After\r\nthis, he proceeds to describe a mechanism the details of which are\r\nconfusing and unintelligible, nor did it appear to bear any resemblance\r\nto a telescopic tube.\r\n\r\nIn a work published by Thomas Digges in 1591, he makes the following\r\nallusion to his father's experiments with the lenses: 'My father, by his\r\ncontinuall painfull practices, assisted with demonstrations\r\nmathematicall, was able, and sundry times hath by proportionall glasses,\r\nduely situate in convenient angles, not only discouered things farre\r\noff, read letters, numbered peeces of money with the verye coyne and\r\nsuperscription thereof cast by some of his freends of purpose, upon\r\ndownes in open fields; but also seuen miles off, declared what hath beene\r\ndoone at that instant in priuate places.' It must be admitted that if\r\nLeonard Digges had not constructed a telescope, he knew how to combine\r\nlenses by the aid of which a visual effect was created similar to that\r\nproduced by the use of the instrument.\r\n\r\nThe inventor of the telescope was a Dutchman named Hans Lippershey, who\r\ncarried on the business of a spectacle-maker in the town of Middelburg.\r\nHis discovery was purely accidental. It is said that the\r\ninstrument--which was directed towards a weather-cock on a church spire,\r\nof which it gave a large and inverted image--was for some time exhibited\r\nin his shop as a curiosity before its importance was recognised. The\r\nMarquis Spinola, happening to see this philosophical toy, purchased it,\r\nand presented it to Prince Maurice of Nassau, who imagined it might be\r\nof service for the purpose of military reconnoitring. The value of the\r\ninvention was, however, soon realised, and in the following year\r\ntelescopes were sold in Paris. In 1609, Galileo, when on a visit to a\r\nfriend at Venice, received intelligence of the invention of an\r\ninstrument by a Dutch optician which possessed the power of causing\r\ndistant objects to appear much nearer than when observed by ordinary\r\nvision. The accuracy of this information was confirmed by letters which\r\nhe received from Paris; and this general report, Galileo asserted, was\r\nall he knew of the subject. Fuccarius, in a disparaging letter, says\r\nthat one of the Dutch telescopes had been brought to Venice, and that he\r\nhimself had seen it. This statement is not incompatible with Galileo's\r\naffirmation that he had not seen the original instrument, and knew no\r\nmore about it than what had been communicated to him in the letters from\r\nthe French capital. It was insinuated by Fuccarius that Galileo had seen\r\nthe telescope at Venice, but, as he denied this, we should not hesitate\r\nto believe in his veracity.\r\n\r\nImmediately after his return to Padua, Galileo began to think how he\r\nmight be able to contrive an instrument with properties similar to the\r\none of which he had been informed; and in the following words describes\r\nthe process of reasoning by which he arrived at a successful result: 'I\r\nargued in the following manner. The contrivance consists either of one\r\nglass or of more--one is not sufficient, since it must be either convex,\r\nconcave, or plane. The last does not produce any sensible alteration in\r\nobjects; the concave diminishes them. It is true that the convex\r\nmagnifies, but it renders them confused and indistinct; consequently,\r\none glass is insufficient to produce the desired effect. Proceeding to\r\nconsider two glasses, and bearing in mind that the plane causes no\r\nchange, I determined that the instrument could not consist of the\r\ncombination of a plane glass with either of the other two. I therefore\r\napplied myself to make experiments on combinations of the two other\r\nkinds, and thus obtained that of which I was in search.' Galileo's\r\ntelescope consisted of two lenses--one plano-convex, the other\r\nplano-concave, the latter being held next the eye. These he fixed in a\r\npiece of organ pipe, which served the purpose of a tube, the glasses\r\nbeing distant from each other by the difference of their focal lengths.\r\nAn exactly similar principle is adopted in the construction of an\r\nopera-glass, which can be accurately described as a double Galilean\r\ntelescope. Galileo must be regarded as the inventor of this kind of\r\ntelescope, which in one respect differed very materially from the one\r\nconstructed by the Dutch optician. If what has been said with regard to\r\nthe _inverted_ weather-cock be true, then Lippershey's telescope was\r\nmade with two convex lenses, distant from each other by the sum of their\r\nfocal lengths, and all objects observed with it were seen inverted.\r\nRefracting astronomical telescopes are now constructed on this\r\nprinciple, it having been discovered that for observational purposes\r\nthey possess several advantages over the Galilean instrument. When\r\nGalileo had completed his first telescope he returned with it to\r\nVenice, where he exhibited it to his friends. The sensation created by\r\nthis small instrument, which magnified only three times, was most\r\nextraordinary, and almost amounted to a frenzy. Crowds of the principal\r\ncitizens of Venice flocked to Galileo's house in order that they might\r\nsee the magical tube about which such wonderful reports were circulated;\r\nand for upwards of a month he was daily occupied in describing his\r\ninvention to attentive audiences. At the expiration of this time the\r\nDoge of Venice, Leonardo Deodati, hinted that the Senate would not be\r\naverse to receive the telescope as a gift. Galileo readily acquiesced\r\nwith this desire, and, as an acknowledgment of his merits, a decree was\r\nissued confirming his appointment as professor at Padua for life, and\r\nincreasing his salary from 500 to 1,000 florins. The public excitement\r\ncreated by the telescope showed no signs of abatement. Sirturi mentions\r\nthat, having succeeded in constructing an instrument, he ascended the\r\ntower of St. Mark's at Venice, hoping to be able to use it there without\r\ninterruption. He was, however, detected by a few individuals, and soon\r\nsurrounded by a crowd, which took possession of his telescope, and\r\ndetained him for several hours until their curiosity was satisfied.\r\nEager inquiries having been made as to where he lodged, Sirturi, fearing\r\na repetition of his experience in the church tower, decided to quit\r\nVenice early next morning, and betake himself to a quieter and less\r\nfrequented neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe instrument was at first called Galileo's tube; the double eye-glass;\r\nthe perspective; the trunk; the cylinder. The appellation _telescope_\r\nwas given it by Demisiano.\r\n\r\nGalileo next directed his attention to the construction of telescopes,\r\nand applied his mechanical skill in making instruments of a larger size,\r\none of which magnified _eight_ times. 'And at length,' he writes,\r\n'sparing neither labour nor expense, he completed an instrument that was\r\ncapable of magnifying more than _thirty_ times.'\r\n\r\nGalileo now commenced an exploration of the celestial regions with his\r\ntelescope, and on carefully examining some of the heavenly bodies, made\r\nmany wonderful discoveries which added greatly to the fame and lustre of\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\nThe first celestial object to which Galileo directed his telescope was\r\nthe Moon. He was deeply interested to find how much her surface\r\nresembled that of the Earth, and was able to perceive lofty mountain\r\nranges, the illumined peaks of which reflected the sunlight, whilst\r\ntheir bases and sides were still enveloped in dark shadow; great plains\r\nwhich he imagined were seas, valleys, elevated ridges, depressions, and\r\ninequalities similar to what are found on our globe. Galileo believed\r\nthe Moon to be a habitable world, and concluded that the dark and\r\nluminous portions of her surface were land and water, which reflected\r\nwith unequal intensity the light of the Sun. The followers of Aristotle\r\nreceived the announcement of these discoveries with much displeasure.\r\nThey maintained that the Moon was perfectly spherical and smooth--a vast\r\nmirror, the dark portions of which were the reflection of our\r\nterrestrial mountains and forests--and accused Galileo 'of taking a\r\ndelight in distorting and ruining the fairest works of Nature.' He\r\nappealed to the unequal condition of the surface of our globe, but this\r\nwas of no avail in altering their preconceived notions of the lunar\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important discovery made by Galileo with the telescope\r\nwas that of the four moons of Jupiter. On the night of January 7, 1610,\r\nwhen engaged in observing the planet, his attention was attracted by\r\nthree small stars which appeared brighter than those in their immediate\r\nneighbourhood. They were all in a straight line and parallel with the\r\necliptic; two of them were situated to the east, and one to the west of\r\nJupiter. On the following night he was surprised to find all three to\r\nthe west of the planet, and nearer to each other. This caused him\r\nconsiderable perplexity, and he was at a loss to understand how Jupiter\r\ncould be east of the three stars, when on the preceding night he was\r\nobserved to the west of two of them. Galileo was unable to reconcile the\r\naltered positions of those bodies with the apparent motion of Jupiter\r\namong the fixed stars as indicated by the astronomical tables. The next\r\nopportunity he had of observing them was on the 10th, when two stars\r\nonly were visible, and they were to the east of the planet. As it was\r\nimpossible for Jupiter to move from west to east on January 8 and from\r\neast to west on the 10th, he concluded that it was the motion of the\r\nstars and not that of Jupiter which accounted for the observed\r\nphenomena. Galileo watched the stars attentively on successive evenings\r\nand discovered a fourth, and on observing how they changed their\r\npositions relatively to each other he soon arrived at the conclusion\r\nthat the stars were four moons which revolved round Jupiter after the\r\nmanner in which the Moon revolves round the Earth. Having assured\r\nhimself that the four new stars were four moons that with periodical\r\nregularity circled round the great planet, Galileo named them the\r\nMedicean Stars in honour of his patron, Cosmo de' Medici, Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany. He also published an essay entitled 'Nuncius Sidereus,' or the\r\n'Sidereal Messenger,' which contained an account of this important\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of Galileo's discovery of the four satellites of\r\nJupiter created a profound sensation, and its significance became at\r\nonce apparent. Aristotelians and Ptolemaists received the information\r\nwith much disfavour and incredulity, and many persons positively refused\r\nto believe Galileo, whom they accused of inventing fables. On the other\r\nhand, the upholders of the Copernican theory hailed it with\r\nsatisfaction, as it declared that Jupiter with his four moons\r\nconstituted a system of greater magnitude and importance than that of\r\nour globe with her single satellite, and that consequently the Earth\r\ncould not be regarded as the centre of the universe.\r\n\r\nWhen Kepler heard of this remarkable discovery, he wrote to Galileo and\r\nexpressed himself in the following characteristic manner: 'I was sitting\r\nidle at home thinking of you, most excellent Galileo, and your letters,\r\nwhen the news was brought me of the discovery of four planets by the\r\nhelp of the double eye-glass. Wachenfels stopped his carriage at my door\r\nto tell me, when such a fit of wonder seized me at a report which seemed\r\nso very absurd, and I was thrown into such agitation at seeing an old\r\ndispute between us decided in this way, that between his joy, my\r\ncolouring, and the laughter of both, confounded as we were by such a\r\nnovelty, we were hardly capable, he of speaking, or I of listening.... I\r\nam so far from disbelieving in the existence of the four circumjovial\r\nplanets, that I long for a telescope to anticipate you, if possible, in\r\ndiscovering two round Mars (as the proportion seems to me to require),\r\nsix or eight round Saturn, and perhaps one each round Mercury and\r\nVenus.' The intelligence of Galileo's discoveries was received by his\r\nopponents in a spirit entirely different from that manifested by Kepler.\r\nThe principal professor of philosophy at Padua, when requested to look\r\nat the Moon and planets through Galileo's glass, persistently declined,\r\nand did his utmost to persuade the Grand Duke that the four satellites\r\nof Jupiter could not possibly exist. Francesco Sizzi, a Florentine\r\nastronomer, argued that, as there are seven apertures in the head,\r\nseven known metals, and seven days in the week, so there could only be\r\nseven planets. To these absurd remarks Galileo replied by saying that,\r\n'whatever their force might be as a reason for believing beforehand that\r\nno more than seven planets would be discovered, they hardly seemed of\r\nsufficient weight to destroy the new ones when actually seen.' Another\r\nindividual, named Christmann, writes: 'We are not to think that Jupiter\r\nhas four satellites given him by Nature in order, by revolving round\r\nhim, to immortalize the name of the Medici, who first had notice of the\r\nobservation. These are the dreams of idle men, who love ludicrous ideas\r\nbetter than our laborious and industrious correction of the heavens.\r\nNature abhors so horrible a chaos, and to the truly wise such vanity is\r\ndetestable.' Martin Horky, a _protege_ of Kepler's, issued a pamphlet in\r\nwhich he made a violent attack on Galileo. He says: 'I will never\r\nconcede his four new planets to that Italian from Padua though I die for\r\nit.' He then asks the following questions, and replies to them himself:\r\n(1) Whether they exist? (2) What they are? (3) What they are like? (4)\r\nWhy they are? 'The first question is soon disposed of by Horky's\r\ndeclaring positively that he has examined the heavens with Galileo's own\r\nglass, and that no such thing as a satellite about Jupiter exists. To\r\nthe second, he declared solemnly that he does not more surely know that\r\nhe has a soul in his body than that reflected rays are the sole cause of\r\nGalileo's erroneous observations. In regard to the third question, he\r\nsays that these planets are like the smallest fly compared to an\r\nelephant; and, finally, concludes on the fourth, that the only use of\r\nthem is to gratify Galileo's \"thirst of gold,\" and to afford himself a\r\nsubject of discussion.'[7] Galileo did not condescend to take any notice\r\nof this scurrilous production; but Horky, who imagined that he had done\r\nsomething clever, sent a copy of his pamphlet to Kepler. In a few days\r\nafter he called to see him, and was received with such a storm of\r\nindignation that he begged for mercy and implored his forgiveness.\r\nKepler forgave him, but insisted on his making amends. He writes: 'I\r\nhave taken him again into favour upon this preliminary condition, to\r\nwhich he has agreed--that I am to show him Jupiter's satellites, _and he\r\nis to see them_, and own that they are there.'\r\n\r\nThe evidence in support of the existence of Jupiter's satellites became\r\nso conclusive that the opponents of Galileo were compelled to renounce\r\ntheir disbelief in those bodies, whether real or pretended. The Grand\r\nDuke, preferring to trust to his eyes rather than believe in the\r\narguments of the professor at Padua, observed the satellites on several\r\noccasions, along with Galileo, at Pisa, and on his departure bestowed\r\nupon him a gift of one thousand florins. Several of Galileo's enemies,\r\nas a result of their observations, now arrived at the conclusion that\r\nhis discovery was incomplete, and that Jupiter had more than four\r\nsatellites in attendance upon him. Scheiner counted five, Rheita nine,\r\nand other observers increased the number to twelve. But it was found to\r\nbe quite as hazardous to exceed the number stated by Galileo as it was\r\nto deny the existence of any; for, when Jupiter had traversed a short\r\ndistance of his path among the fixed stars, the only bodies that\r\naccompanied him were his four original attendants, which continued to\r\nrevolve round him with unerring regularity in every part of his orbit.\r\n\r\nGalileo did not afford his opponents much time to oppose or controvert\r\nwith argument the discoveries made by him with the telescope before his\r\nannouncement of a new one attracted public attention from those already\r\nknown. He, however, exercised greater caution in disclosing the results\r\nof his observations, as other persons laid claim to having made similar\r\ndiscoveries prior to the time at which his were announced. He therefore\r\nadopted a method in common use among astronomers in those days, by which\r\nthe letters in a sentence announcing a discovery were transposed so as\r\nto form an anagram.\r\n\r\nGalileo announced his next discovery in this manner, and which read as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n    Smaismrmilme poeta leumi bvne nugttaviras.\r\n\r\nThis, when deciphered, formed the sentence:--\r\n\r\n    Altissimum planetam tergeminum observavi.\r\n\r\n    I have observed that the remotest planet is triple.\r\n\r\nGalileo perceived that Saturn presented a triform appearance, and that,\r\ninstead of one body, there were three, all in a straight line, and\r\napparently in contact with each other, the middle one being larger than\r\nthe two lateral ones. In a letter to Kepler he remarked: 'Now I have\r\ndiscovered a Court for Jupiter, and two servants for this old man, who\r\naid his steps and never quit his side.' Kepler, who excelled as an\r\nimaginative writer, replied: 'I will not make an old man of Saturn, nor\r\nslaves of his attendant globes; but rather let this tricorporate form be\r\nGeryon--so shall Galileo be Hercules, and the telescope his club, armed\r\nwith which he has conquered that distant planet, and dragged him from\r\nthe remotest depths of Nature, and exposed him to the view of all.'\r\nContinuing his observations, Galileo perceived that the two lateral\r\nobjects gradually decreased in size, and at the expiration of two years\r\nentirely disappeared, leaving the central globe visible only. He was\r\nunable to assign any reason for this peculiar occurrence, which caused\r\nhim much perplexity, and he expresses himself thus: 'What is to be said\r\nconcerning so strange a metamorphosis? Are the two lesser stars consumed\r\nafter the manner of the solar spots? Have they vanished and suddenly\r\nfled? Has Saturn, perhaps, devoured his own children? Or were the\r\nappearances, indeed, illusion or fraud, with which the glasses have so\r\nlong deceived me, as well as many others to whom I have shown them? Now,\r\nperhaps, is the time to revive the well-nigh withered hopes of those\r\nwho, guided by more profound contemplations, have discovered the fallacy\r\nof the new observations, and demonstrated the utter impossibility of\r\ntheir existence. I do not know what to say in a case so surprising, so\r\nunlooked-for, and so novel. The shortness of the time, the unexpected\r\nnature of the event, the weakness of my understanding, and the fear of\r\nbeing mistaken, have greatly confounded me.' After a certain interval\r\nthose bodies reappeared; but Galileo's glass was not sufficiently\r\npowerful to enable him to ascertain their nature nor solve the mystery,\r\nwhich for upwards of half a century perplexed the ablest astronomers.\r\n\r\nThe elucidation of this inexplicable phenomenon was reserved for\r\nChristian Huygens, who, with an improved telescope of his own\r\nconstruction, was able to declare that Saturn's appendages were portions\r\nof a ring which surrounds the planet, and is everywhere distinct from\r\nits surface.\r\n\r\nGalileo next directed his attention to the planet Venus, and as a result\r\nof his observations was led to communicate to the public another\r\nanagram:--\r\n\r\n    Haec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur oy.\r\n\r\nThis, when rendered correctly, reads:--\r\n\r\n    Cynthiae figuras aemulatur mater amorum.\r\n\r\n    Venus rivals the appearances of the Moon.\r\n\r\nThe phases of Venus were one of the most interesting of Galileo's\r\ndiscoveries with the telescope. When observed near inferior conjunction\r\nthe planet presents the appearance of a slender crescent, resembling\r\nthe Moon when a few days old. Travelling from this point to superior\r\nconjunction, the illumined portion of her disc gradually increases,\r\nuntil it becomes circular, like the full Moon. This changing appearance\r\nof Venus afforded Galileo irresistible proof that the planet is an\r\nopaque body, which derives its light from the Sun, and that it circles\r\nround the orb--convincing evidence of the accuracy and truthfulness of\r\nthe Copernican theory.\r\n\r\nIt was in this manner that Galileo announced his discovery of the phases\r\nof Venus, the peerless planet of our morning and evening skies, whose\r\nslender crescent forms such a beautiful object in the telescope, and\r\nwho, as she traverses her orbit, exhibits all the varied changes of form\r\npresented by the Moon in her monthly journey round the Earth. These\r\nvarying aspects of Venus were not unknown to Milton; and, indeed, he may\r\nhave been informed of them by Galileo in his conversation with him at\r\nArcetri; nor has he failed to introduce an allusion to this beautiful\r\nphenomenon in his poem. In his description of the Creation, after the\r\nSun was formed, he adds:--\r\n\r\n    Hither, as to their fountain, other stars\r\n    Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,\r\n    And hence the morning planet gilds her horns.--vii. 364-66.\r\n\r\nGalileo also discovered that the planet Mars does not always present the\r\nappearance of a circular disc. When near opposition the full disc of the\r\nplanet is visible, but at all other times it is gibbous, and approaches\r\nnearest to that of a half-moon when at the quadratures.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1610, on directing his telescope to the Sun, Galileo\r\ndetected dark spots on the solar disc. Similar spots, sufficiently large\r\nto be distinguished by the naked eye, had been observed from time to\r\ntime for centuries prior to the invention of the telescope, but nothing\r\nwas known of their nature. In 1609 Kepler observed a spot on the Sun,\r\nwhich he thought was the planet Mercury in conjunction with the orb; the\r\nshort time during which it was visible, in consequence of clouds having\r\nobscured the face of the luminary, prevented him from being able to\r\ndetermine the accuracy of his surmise, but since then it has been\r\nascertained that no transit of Mercury took place at that time, and\r\nKepler afterwards acknowledged that he had arrived at an erroneous\r\nconclusion. Galileo was much puzzled in trying to find out the true\r\nnature of the spots. At first he was led to imagine that planets like\r\nMercury and Venus revolved round the Sun at a short distance from the\r\norb, and that their dark bodies, travelling across the solar disc, gave\r\nrise to the phenomenon of the spots. After further observation, he\r\nascertained that the spots were in actual contact with the Sun; that\r\nthey were irregular in shape and size, and continued to appear and\r\ndisappear. Sometimes a large spot would break up into several smaller\r\nones, and at other times three or four small spots would unite to form a\r\nlarge one. They all had a common motion, and appeared to rotate with\r\nthe Sun, from which Galileo concluded that the orb rotated on his axis\r\nin about twenty-eight days. Galileo believed that the spots were clouds\r\nfloating in the solar atmosphere, and that they intercepted a portion of\r\nthe light of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe Milky Way, that wondrous zone of light which encircles the heavens,\r\nremained for many ages a source of perplexity to ancient astronomers and\r\nphilosophers, who, in their endeavours to ascertain its nature, had\r\narrived at various absurd and erroneous conclusions. On directing his\r\ntelescope to this luminous tract, Galileo discovered, to his\r\ninexpressible admiration, that it consists of a vast multitude of stars,\r\ntoo minute to be visible to the naked eye. He also discerned that its\r\nmilky luminosity is created by the blended light of myriads of stars, so\r\nremote as to be incapable of definition by his telescope. In his\r\n'Nuncius Sidereus' he gives an account of his observations of the Galaxy\r\nand expresses his satisfaction that he has been enabled to terminate an\r\nancient controversy by demonstrating to the senses the stellar structure\r\nof the Milky Way. When engaged in exploring the celestial regions with\r\nhis telescope, Galileo observed a marked difference in the appearance of\r\nthe fixed stars, as compared with that of the planets. Each of the\r\nlatter showed a rounded disc resembling that of a small moon, but the\r\nstars exhibited no disc, and shone as vivid sparkling points of light;\r\nall of them, whether of large or small magnitude, presenting the same\r\nappearance in the telescope. This led him to conclude that the fixed\r\nstars were not illumined by the Sun, because their brilliancy in all\r\ntheir changes of position remained unaltered. But, in the case of the\r\nplanets, he found that their lustre varied according to their distance\r\nfrom the Sun; consequently, he believed they were opaque bodies which\r\nreflected the solar rays. On directing his telescope to the Pleiades,\r\nwhich, to the naked eye, appear as a group of seven stars, he succeeded\r\nin counting forty lucid points. The nebula Praesepe in Cancer, he was\r\nalso able to resolve into a cluster of stars. Galileo made many other\r\nobservations of the heavenly bodies with his telescope, all of which he\r\ndescribes as having afforded him 'incredible delight.'\r\n\r\nShortly before the failure of his eyesight, Galileo discovered the\r\nMoon's diurnal libration, a variation in the visible edges of the Moon\r\ncaused by its oscillatory motion, and the diurnal rotation of the Earth\r\non her axis.\r\n\r\nThough Milton has not favoured us with any interesting details of his\r\ninterview with Galileo, nor expressed his opinions with regard to the\r\ncontroversies which at that time agitated both the religious and\r\nscientific worlds of thought, and which eventually culminated in a storm\r\nof rancour and hatred that burst over the devoted head of the aged\r\nastronomer, and brought him to his knees, yet he informs us that he\r\n'found and visited' Galileo, whom he describes as 'grown old,' and\r\ncynically remarks that he 'was held a prisoner of the Inquisition for\r\nthinking in astronomy otherwise than the Franciscan and Dominican\r\nlicensers thought.' Milton does not allude to his blindness, and yet it\r\nwould be natural to imagine that, had his host suffered from this\r\naffliction at the time of his visit, he would have referred to it. We\r\nlearn that Milton arrived in Italy in the spring of 1638. In 1637, the\r\naffection which, in the preceding year, deprived Galileo of the use of\r\nhis right eye, attacked the left also, which began to grow dim, and in\r\nthe course of a few months became sightless; so that, although Milton\r\nhas not alluded to this calamity, Galileo had become totally blind at\r\nthe time of his visit.\r\n\r\nHow much Milton was impressed with the fame of Galileo and his telescope\r\nbecomes apparent on referring to his 'Paradise Lost.' In it he alludes\r\nto the instrument upon three different occasions, twice when in the\r\nhands of Galileo; and the remembrance of the same artist was doubtless\r\nin his mind when he mentions the 'glazed optic tube' in another part of\r\nhis poem. The interval that elapsed from the date of Milton's visit to\r\nGalileo in 1638, to the publication of 'Paradise Lost' in 1667, included\r\na period of about thirty years, yet this length of time did not erase\r\nfrom Milton's memory his recollection of Galileo and of his pleasant\r\nsojourn at Florence.\r\n\r\nThe first allusion in the poem to the Italian astronomer is in the lines\r\nin which Milton describes the shield carried by Satan:--\r\n\r\n                      The broad circumference\r\n    Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose orb\r\n    Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views\r\n    At evening, from the top of Fesole,\r\n    Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,\r\n    Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.--i. 286-91.\r\n\r\nGalileo is described as having observed the Moon from the heights of\r\nFesole, which formed part of the suburbs of Florence, or from Valdarno,\r\nthe valley of the Arno, in which the city is situated. The belief that\r\nGalileo had discovered continents and seas on the Moon justified Milton\r\nin imagining the existence of rivers and mountains on the lunar surface.\r\nThe expression 'spotty globe' is more descriptive of the appearance of\r\nour satellite when observed with the telescope, than when seen with the\r\nnaked eye. Galileo's attention was attracted by the freckled aspect of\r\nthe Moon--a visual effect created by the number of extinct volcanoes\r\nscattered over the surface of the orb.\r\n\r\nIn his next allusion to the telescope Milton associates Galileo's name\r\nwith the instrument:--\r\n\r\n                      As when by night the glass\r\n    Of Galileo, less assured, observes\r\n    Imagined lands and regions in the Moon.--v. 261-63.\r\n\r\nIn these lines Milton describes with accuracy the extent of Galileo's\r\nknowledge of our satellite. The conclusions which the Italian astronomer\r\narrived at with regard to its habitability were not supported by\r\ntelescopic evidence sufficient to justify such a belief. Galileo writes:\r\n'Had its surface been absolutely smooth it would have been but a vast,\r\nunblessed desert, void of animals, of plants, of cities and men; the\r\nabode of silence and inaction--senseless, lifeless, soulless, and\r\nstripped of all those ornaments which now render it so variable and so\r\nbeautiful:'--\r\n\r\n    There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps\r\n    Astronomer in the Sun's lucent orb\r\n    Through his glazed optic tube yet never saw.--iii. 588-90.\r\n\r\nMilton may have remembered that Galileo was the first astronomer who\r\ndirected a telescope to the Sun; and that he discovered the dark spots\r\nfrequently seen on the solar disc.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has read a history of the life of Galileo, and contemplated\r\nthe career of this remarkable man, his ardent struggles in the cause of\r\nfreedom and philosophic truth, his victories and reverses, his brilliant\r\nastronomical discoveries, and his investigation of the laws of motion,\r\nand other natural phenomena, will arrive at the conclusion that he\r\nmerited the distinction conferred upon him by our great English poet,\r\nwhen he included him among the renowned few whose names are found in the\r\npages of 'Paradise Lost.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE SEASONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great path of the Sun among the constellations as seen from the\r\nEarth is called the Ecliptic. It is divided into 360 deg., and again into\r\ntwelve equal parts of 30 deg., called Signs. As one half of the ecliptic is\r\nnorth, and the other half south, of the equator, the line of\r\nintersection of their planes is at two points which are known as the\r\nequinoctial points, because, when the Sun on his upward and downward\r\njourney arrives at either of them the days and nights are of equal\r\nlength all over the world. The equinoctial points are not stationary,\r\nbut have a westerly motion of 50'' annually along the ecliptic; at this\r\nrate they will require a period of 25,868 years to complete an entire\r\ncircuit of the heavens.\r\n\r\nMilton alludes to the ecliptic when he mentions the arrival of Satan\r\nupon the Earth:--\r\n\r\n    Down from the ecliptic, sped with hoped success,\r\n    Throws his steep flight in many an airy wheel,\r\n    Nor staid till on Niphates top he lights.--iii. 740-42.\r\n\r\nExtending for 9 deg. on each side of the ecliptic is a zone or belt called\r\nthe Zodiac, the mesial line of which is occupied by the Sun, and within\r\nthis space the principal planets perform their annual revolutions. It\r\nwas for long believed that the paths of all the planets lay within the\r\nzodiac, but on the discovery of the minor planets, Ceres, Pallas, and\r\nJuno, it was ascertained that they travelled beyond this zone. The stars\r\nsituated within the zodiac are divided into twelve groups or\r\nconstellations, which correspond with the twelve signs, and each is\r\nnamed after an animal or some figure which it is supposed to resemble.\r\nThe zodiac is of great antiquity; the ancient Egyptians and Hindoos made\r\nuse of it, and there are allusions to it in the earliest astronomical\r\nrecords. The twelve constellations of the zodiac bear the following\r\nnames:--\r\n\r\nAries the Ram\r\nTaurus the Bull\r\nGemini the Twins\r\nCancer the Crab\r\nLeo the Lion\r\nVirgo the Virgin\r\nLibra the Balance\r\nScorpio the Scorpion\r\nSagittarius the Archer\r\nCapricornus the Goat\r\nAquarius the Water-bearer\r\nPisces the Fishes\r\n\r\nIn close association with the Sun's annual journey are the seasons, upon\r\nthe regular sequence of which mankind depend for the various products of\r\nthe soil essential for the maintenance and enjoyment of life. The\r\nrevolution of the Earth in her orbit, and the inclination of her axis to\r\nher annual path, causing the plane of the equator to be inclined 23-1/2 deg.\r\nto that of the ecliptic, are the reasons which account for the\r\nsuccession of the seasons--Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Owing to\r\nthe position of the Earth's axis with regard to her orbit, the Sun\r\nappears to travel 23-1/2 deg. north and 23-1/2 deg. south of the equator. When,\r\non June 21, the orb attains his highest northern altitude, we have the\r\nsummer solstice and the longest days; when, by retracing his steps, he\r\ndeclines 23-1/2 deg. below the equator, at which point he arrives on\r\nDecember 21, we have the winter solstice and the shortest days.\r\nIntermediate between those two seasons are spring and autumn. When the\r\nSun, on his journey northward, reaches the equator, we have the vernal\r\nequinox, and at this period of the year the days and nights are of equal\r\nlength all over the globe. In a similar manner, when, on his return\r\njourney, the Sun is again on the equator, the autumnal equinox occurs.\r\nIn summer the North Pole is inclined towards the Sun, consequently his\r\nrays fall more direct and impart much more heat to the northern\r\nhemisphere than in winter, when the Pole is turned away from the Sun.\r\nThis difference in the incidence of the solar rays upon the surface of\r\nthe globe, along with the increased length of the day, mainly accounts\r\nfor the high temperature of summer as compared with that of winter.\r\n\r\nAstronomically, the seasons commence at the periods of the equinoxes and\r\nsolstices. Spring begins on March 21, the time of the vernal equinox;\r\nsummer on June 21, at the summer solstice; autumn on September 22, at\r\nthe autumnal equinox; and winter on December 21, at the winter solstice.\r\nThis conventional division of the year is not equally applicable to all\r\nparts of the globe. In the arctic and antarctic regions spring and\r\nautumn are very brief, the summer is short and the winter of long\r\nduration. In the tropics, owing to the comparatively slight difference\r\nin the obliquity of the Sun's rays, one season is, as regards\r\ntemperature, not much different from the other; but in the temperate\r\nregions of the Earth the vicissitudes of the seasons are more\r\nperceptible and can be best distinguished by the growth of vegetation,\r\nand the changes observable in the foliage of shrubs and trees. In spring\r\nthere is the budding, in summer the blossom, in autumn the\r\nfruit-bearing, and in winter the leafless condition of deciduous trees,\r\nand the repose of vegetable life.\r\n\r\nThe legendary belief that before the Fall there reigned on the Earth a\r\nperpetual spring, is introduced by Milton in his poem when he describes\r\nthe pleasant surroundings associated with the happy conditions of life\r\nthat existed in Paradise:--\r\n\r\n                                Thus was this place,\r\n    A happy rural seat of various view:\r\n    Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm;\r\n    Others whose fruit, burnished with golden rind,\r\n    Hung amiable--Hesperian fables true,\r\n    If true here only--and of delicious taste.\r\n    Betwixt them lawns, or level downs, and flocks\r\n    Grazing the tender herb, were interposed,\r\n    Or palmy hillock; or the flowery lap\r\n    Of some irriguous valley spread her store,\r\n    Flowers of all hue, and without thorn the rose.\r\n    Another side, umbrageous grots and caves\r\n    Of cool recess, o'er which the mantling vine\r\n    Lays forth her purple grape, and gently creeps\r\n    Luxuriant; meanwhile murmuring waters fall\r\n    Down the slope hill dispersed, or in a lake\r\n    That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned\r\n    Her crystal mirror holds, unite their streams.\r\n    The birds their quire apply; airs, vernal airs,\r\n    Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune\r\n    The trembling leaves, while universal Pan,\r\n    Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,\r\n    Led on the eternal Spring.--iv. 246-68.\r\n\r\nIn sad contrast with this charming sylvan scene, we turn to the unhappy\r\nconsequences which ensued as a result of the first act of transgression.\r\nMilton describes a change of climate characterised by extremes of heat\r\nand cold which succeeded the perpetual spring. The Sun was made to shine\r\nso that the Earth should be exposed to torrid heat and icy cold\r\nunpleasant to endure. The pale Moon and the planets were given power to\r\ncombine with noxious effect, and the fixed stars to shed their malignant\r\ninfluences:--\r\n\r\n                                            The Sun\r\n    Had first his precept so to move, so shine,\r\n    As might affect the Earth with cold and heat\r\n    Scarce tolerable, and from the north to call\r\n    Decrepit winter, from the south to bring\r\n    Solstitial summer's heat. To the blanc Moon\r\n    Her office they prescribed; to the other five\r\n    Their planetary motions and aspects,\r\n    In sextile, square, and trine, and opposite,\r\n    Of noxious efficacy, and when to join\r\n    In synod unbenign; and taught the fixed\r\n    Their influence malignant when to shower--\r\n    Which of them rising with the Sun or falling,\r\n    Should prove tempestuous. To the winds they set\r\n    Their corners, when with bluster to confound\r\n    Sea, air, and shore; the thunder when to roll\r\n    With terror through the dark aerial hall.--x. 651-67.\r\n\r\nWe are here afforded an opportunity of learning that Milton possessed\r\nsome knowledge of astrology, to which he makes allusion in other parts\r\nof his poem besides. In his time, astrology was believed in by many\r\npersons, and there were few learned men but who knew something of that\r\noccult science. Milton may be included among those who devoted some\r\nattention to astrology. Of this there is ample evidence, by the manner\r\nin which he expresses himself in words and phrases in common use among\r\nastrologers.\r\n\r\nThe professors of this art recognised five planetary aspects, viz.,\r\nopposition, conjunction, sextile, square, and trine, each possessing its\r\npeculiar kind of influence on events. The Moon, the planets, and the\r\nconstellations in their conjunctions and configurations, were believed\r\nto reveal to those who could understand the significance of their\r\naspects, the destiny of individuals and the occurrence of future events.\r\nThe inauspicious influences of the heavenly bodies are described by\r\nMilton as contributing to the general disarrangement of the happy\r\ncondition of things that existed before the Fall.\r\n\r\nAfter having described the adverse physical changes which occurred in\r\nNature as a consequence of the Fall, Milton makes use of his\r\nastronomical knowledge in explaining how they were brought about, and\r\nsuggests two hypotheses: (1) a change of position of the Earth's axis;\r\n(2) an alteration of the Sun's path from the equinoctial road:--\r\n\r\n    Some say he bid his Angels turn askance\r\n    The poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more\r\n    From the Sun's axle; they with labour pushed\r\n    Oblique the centric globe: some say the Sun\r\n    Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road\r\n    Like distant breadth--to Taurus with the seven\r\n    Atlantic Sisters, and the Spartan Twins,\r\n    Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amain\r\n    By Leo, and the Virgin, and the Scales,\r\n    As deep as Capricorn; to bring in change\r\n    Of seasons to each clime. Else had the spring\r\n    Perpetual smiled on Earth with vernant flowers.--x. 668-79.\r\n\r\nIn support of the theory of a perpetual spring, Milton assumes that the\r\nEarth's axis was directed at right angles to her orbit, and that the\r\nplane of the equator coincided with that of the ecliptic. Consequently,\r\nthe Sun's path remained always on the equator, where his rays were\r\nvertical, and north and south of this line each locality on the Earth\r\nenjoyed one constant season, the character of which depended upon its\r\ngeographical position. In what are now the temperate regions of the\r\nglobe there was one continuous season, similar in climate and length of\r\nday to what is experienced at the vernal equinox, when the Sun is for a\r\nfew days on the equator. There was then no winter, no summer, nor\r\nautumn; and, consequently, the growth of vegetation must have taken\r\nplace under conditions of climate entirely different to what exist on\r\nthe Earth at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe change of position of the Earth's axis, 'twice ten degrees and more\r\nfrom the Sun's axle,' is described by Milton as having been\r\naccomplished by the might of angels, who 'with labour pushed oblique the\r\ncentric globe.'\r\n\r\n(2) According to the Ptolemaic belief, the Sun revolved round the Earth,\r\nbut his course was altered from the equinoctial road to the path that he\r\nnow pursues, which is the ecliptic. Instead of remaining on the equator,\r\nhe travels an equal distance from this line upwards and downwards in\r\neach hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe path of the Sun in the heavens is described by Milton with marked\r\nprecision, and he mentions in regular order the names of the zodiacal\r\nconstellations through which the orb travels. Passing through Taurus\r\nwith the seven Atlantic Sisters (the Pleiades) and the Spartan Twins\r\n(Gemini), he enters the Tropic Crab (Cancer), in which constellation he\r\nattains his highest northern altitude; thence downwards he travels\r\nthrough Leo, Virgo, and the Scales (Libra), as deep as Capricornus,\r\nreaching his lowest point of declination at the winter solstice; and\r\nwere it not for this alteration of the Sun's path, the poet informs us\r\nthat perpetual spring would have reigned upon the Earth.\r\n\r\nMilton was evidently well acquainted with the astronomical reasons (the\r\nrevolution of the Earth in her orbit and the obliquity of the ecliptic)\r\nby which the occurrence and regular sequence of the seasons can be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nThe path of the Sun in the heavens; his upward and downward course from\r\nthe equator; the names of the constellations through which the orb\r\ntravels, and the periods of the year at which he enters them, were also\r\nfamiliar to him.\r\n\r\nThe grateful change of the seasons, and the varied aspects of nature\r\npeculiar to each, which give a charm and freshness to the rolling year,\r\nmust have been to Milton a source of pleasure and delight, and have\r\nstimulated his poetic fancy.\r\n\r\nHis observation of natural phenomena, and his keen perception of the\r\npleasing changes which accompany them, are described in the following\r\nlines:--\r\n\r\n    As, when from mountain-tops the dusky clouds\r\n    Ascending, while the north wind sleeps, o'erspread\r\n    Heaven's cheerful face, the louring element\r\n    Scowls o'er the darkened landskip snow or shower,\r\n    If chance the radiant Sun, with farewell sweet,\r\n    Extend his evening beam, the fields revive,\r\n    The birds their notes renew, and bleating herds\r\n    Attest their joy, that hill and valley rings.--ii. 488-95.\r\n\r\nThe ancient poets Virgil and Ovid describe the Earth as having been\r\ncreated in the spring; and associated with this season, which\r\n\r\n                    to the heart inspires\r\n    Vernal delight and joy--iv. 154-55,\r\n\r\nwere the Graces and the Hours, which danced hand in hand as they led on\r\nthe eternal Spring.\r\n\r\nMilton alludes to the seasons on several occasions throughout his poem,\r\nand to the natural phenomena associated with them:--\r\n\r\n                                        As bees\r\n    In springtime when the Sun with Taurus rides,\r\n    Pour forth their populous youth about the hive\r\n    In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers\r\n    Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank\r\n    The suburb of their straw-built citadel\r\n    New rubbed with balm, expatiate and confer\r\n    Their state affairs.--i. 768-75.\r\n\r\nThe Sun is in the constellation Taurus in April, when the warmth of his\r\nrays begins to impart new life and activity to the insect world after\r\ntheir long winter's sleep.\r\n\r\nIn his description of the repast partaken by the Angel Raphael with Adam\r\nand Eve in Paradise, Milton writes:--\r\n\r\n                              Raised of grassy turf\r\n    Their table was, and mossy seats had round,\r\n    And on her ample square, from side to side,\r\n    All Autumn piled, though Spring and Autumn here\r\n    Danced hand in hand.--v. 391-95.\r\n\r\nIn describing Beelzebub when about to address the Stygian Council, he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n                                          His look\r\n    Drew audience and attention still as night\r\n    Or summer's noontide air, while thus he spake.--ii. 307-309.\r\n\r\nThe failing vision from which Milton suffered in his declining years was\r\nsucceeded by total blindness. This sad affliction he alludes to in the\r\nfollowing lines:--\r\n\r\n                              Thus with the year\r\n    Seasons return; but not to me returns\r\n    Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,\r\n    Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose.--iii. 40-43.\r\n\r\nWe are able to perceive how much Milton was impressed with the beautiful\r\nseasons, and the varying aspects of the year which accompany them, and\r\nhow his poetic imagination luxuriated in the changing variety of nature\r\nobservable in earth and sky that from day to day afforded him exquisite\r\ndelight; and, although his poem was written when blindness had overtaken\r\nhim, yet those glad remembrances remained as fresh in his memory as when\r\nin his youth he roamed among the flowery meadows, the vocal woodlands,\r\nand the winding lanes of Buckinghamshire.\r\n\r\nThe idea expressed by Milton that the primitive earth enjoyed a\r\nperpetual spring, though pleasing to the imagination, and well adapted\r\nfor poetic description, is not sustained by any astronomical testimony.\r\nIndeed, the position of the Earth, with her axis at right angles to her\r\norbit, is one which may be regarded as being ill adapted for the support\r\nand maintenance of life on her surface, just as her present position is\r\nthe best that can be imagined for fulfilling this purpose.\r\n\r\nAstronomy teaches us to rely with certainty upon the permanence and\r\nregular sequence of the seasons. The position of the Earth's axis as she\r\nspeeds along in her orbit through the unresisting ether remains\r\nunchanged, and her rapid rotation has the effect of increasing its\r\nstability. Yet, the Earth performs none of her motions with rigid\r\nprecision, and there is a very slow alteration of the position of her\r\naxis occurring, which, if unchecked, would eventually produce a\r\ncoincidence of the equator and the ecliptic. Instead of a succession of\r\nthe seasons, there would then be perpetual spring upon the Earth, and,\r\nalthough it would require a great epoch of time to bring about such a\r\nchange, there would result a condition of things entirely different to\r\nwhat now exists on the globe. But, before the ecliptic can have\r\napproached sufficiently near the equator to produce any appreciable\r\neffect upon the climate of the Earth, its motion must cease, and after\r\nremaining stationary for a time, it will begin to recede to its former\r\nposition. The seasons must therefore follow each other in regular\r\nsequence, and throughout all time, reminding us of the promise of the\r\nCreator, 'that while the Earth remaineth seed-time and harvest, and cold\r\nand heat, and summer and winter shall not cease.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE STARRY HEAVENS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe celestial vault, that, like a circling canopy of sapphire hue,\r\nstretches overhead from horizon to horizon, resplendent by night with\r\nmyriad stars of different magnitudes and varied brilliancy, forming\r\nclusterings and configurations of fantastic shape and beauty, arrests\r\nthe attention of the most casual observer. But to one who has studied\r\nthe heavens, and followed the efforts of human genius in unravelling the\r\nmysteries associated with those bright orbs, the impression created on\r\nhis mind as he gazes upon them in the still hours of the night, when the\r\nturmoil of life is hushed in repose, is one of wonder and longing to\r\nknow more of their being and the hidden causes which brought them forth.\r\nHere, we have poetry written in letters of gold on the sable vestment of\r\nnight; music in the gliding motion of the spheres; and harmony in the\r\norbital sweep of sun, planet, and satellite.\r\n\r\nMilton was not only familiar with 'the face of the sky,' as it is\r\npopularly called, but also knew the structure of the celestial sphere,\r\nand the great circles by which it is circumscribed. Two of those--the\r\ncolures--he alludes to in the following lines, when he describes the\r\nmanner in which Satan, to avoid detection, compassed the Earth, after\r\nhis discovery by Gabriel in Paradise, and his flight thence:--\r\n\r\n    The space of seven continued nights he rode\r\n    With darkness--thrice the equinoctial line\r\n    He circled, four times crossed the car of night\r\n    From pole to pole, traversing each colure.--ix. 63-66.\r\n\r\nAristarchus of Samos believed the stars were golden studs, that\r\nillumined the crystal dome of heaven; but modern research has\r\ntransformed this conception of the ancient astronomer's into a universe\r\nof blazing suns rushing through regions of illimitable space. In\r\nMilton's time astronomers had arrived at no definite conclusion with\r\nregard to the nature of the stars. They were known to be self-luminous\r\nbodies, situated at a remote distance in space, but it had not been\r\nascertained with any degree of certainty that they were suns, resembling\r\nin magnitude and brilliancy our Sun. Indeed, little was known of those\r\norbs until within the past hundred years, when the exploration of the\r\nheavens by the aid of greatly increased telescopic power, was the means\r\nof creating a new branch of astronomical science, called sidereal\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Sir William Herschel, more than to any other\r\nastronomer, for our knowledge of the stellar universe. It was he who\r\nascertained the vastness of its dimensions, and attempted to delineate\r\nits structural configuration. He also explored the star depths, which\r\noccupy the infinitude of space by which we are surrounded, and made\r\nmany wonderful discoveries, which testify to his ability as an observer,\r\nand to his greatness as an astronomer.\r\n\r\nWilliam Herschel was born at Hanover, November 15, 1738. His father was\r\na musician in the band of the Hanoverian Guard, and trained his son in\r\nhis own profession. After four years of military service, young Herschel\r\narrived in England when nineteen years of age, and maintained himself by\r\ngiving lessons in music. We hear of him first at Leeds, where he\r\nfollowed his profession, and instructed the band of the Durham Militia.\r\nFrom Leeds he went to Halifax, and was appointed organist there; on the\r\nexpiration of twelve months he removed to Bath, and was elected to a\r\nsimilar post at the Octagon Chapel in that city. Here, fortune smiled\r\nupon him, and he became a busy and prosperous man. Besides attending to\r\nhis numerous private engagements, he organised concerts, oratorios, and\r\nother public musical entertainments, which gained him much popularity\r\namong the cultivated classes which frequented this fashionable resort.\r\nNotwithstanding his numerous professional engagements, Herschel was able\r\nto devote a portion of his time to acquiring knowledge on other\r\nsubjects. He became proficient in Italian and Greek, studied\r\nmathematics, and read books on astronomy. In 1773 he borrowed a small\r\ntelescope, which he used for observational purposes, and was so\r\ncaptivated with the appearances presented by the celestial bodies, that\r\nhe resolved to dedicate his life to acquiring 'a knowledge of the\r\nconstruction of the heavens.' This resolution he nobly adhered to, and\r\nbecame one of the most distinguished of astronomers. Like many other\r\nastronomers, Herschel possessed the requisite skill which enabled him to\r\nconstruct his own telescopes. Being desirous of possessing a more\r\npowerful instrument, and not having the means to purchase one, he\r\ncommenced the manufacture of specula, the grinding and polishing of\r\nwhich had to be done by hand, entailing the necessity of tedious labour\r\nand the exercise of much patience. After repeated failures he at length\r\ncompleted a 5-1/2-foot Gregorian reflector, and with this instrument\r\nmade his first survey of the heavens. Having perceived the desirability\r\nof possessing a more powerful telescope, he equipped himself with a\r\nreflector of twenty feet focal length, and it was with this instrument\r\nthat he made those wonderful discoveries which established his\r\nreputation as a great astronomer.\r\n\r\nOn March 31, 1781, when examining the stars in the constellation Gemini,\r\nHerschel observed a star which presented an appearance slightly\r\ndifferent to that of the other stars by which it was surrounded; it\r\nlooked larger, had a perceptible disc, and its light became fainter when\r\nviewed with a higher magnifying power. After having carefully examined\r\nthis object, Herschel arrived at the conclusion that he had discovered a\r\ncomet. He communicated intelligence of his discovery to the Royal\r\nSociety, and, a notification of it having been sent to the Continental\r\nobservatories, this celestial visitor was subjected to a close scrutiny;\r\nits progressive motion among the stars was carefully observed, and an\r\norbit was assigned to it. After it had been under observation for some\r\ntime, doubts were expressed as to its being a comet, these were\r\nincreased on further examination, and eventually it was discovered that\r\nthis interesting object was a new planet. This important discovery at\r\nonce raised Herschel to a position of eminence and distinction, and from\r\na star-gazing musician he became a famous astronomer. A new planet named\r\nUranus was added to our system, which completes a revolution round the\r\nSun in a little over eighty-four years, and at a distance of near 1,000\r\nmillions of miles beyond the orbit of Saturn. Herschel's name became a\r\nhousehold word. George III. invited him to Court in order that he might\r\nobtain from his own lips an account of his discovery of the new planet;\r\nand so favourable was the impression made by Herschel upon the King,\r\nthat he proposed to create him Royal Astronomer at Windsor, and bestow\r\nupon him a salary of 200_l._ a year. Herschel decided to accept the\r\nproffered appointment, and, with his sister Caroline, removed from Bath\r\nto Datchet, near Windsor, in 1782, and from there to Slough in 1786. In\r\n1788 he married the wealthy widow of a London merchant, by whom he had\r\none son, who worthily sustained his father's high reputation as an\r\nastronomer. Herschel was created a Knight in 1816, and in 1821 was\r\nelected first President of the Royal Astronomical Society. He died at\r\nSlough on August 25, 1822, when in the eighty-fourth year of his age,\r\nand was buried in Upton Churchyard.\r\n\r\nIt is inscribed on his tomb, that 'he burst the barriers of heaven;' the\r\nlofty praise conveyed by this expression is not greater than what\r\nHerschel merited when we consider with what unwearied assiduity and\r\npatience he laboured to accomplish the results described in the words\r\nwhich have been quoted. By a method called 'star-gauging' he\r\naccomplished an entire survey of the heavens and examined minutely all\r\nthe stars in their groups and aggregations as they passed before his eye\r\nin the field of the telescope. He sounded the depths of the Milky Way,\r\nand explored the wondrous regions of that shining zone, peopled with\r\nmyriads of suns so closely aggregated in some of its tracts as to\r\nsuggest the appearance of a mosaic of stars. He resolved numerous nebulae\r\ninto clusters of stars, and penetrated with his great telescope depth\r\nafter depth of space crowded with 'island universes of stars,' beyond\r\nwhich he was able to discern luminous haze and filmy streaks of light,\r\nthe evidence of the existence of other universes plunged in depths still\r\nmore profound, where space verges on infinity. In his exploration of the\r\nstarry heavens Herschel's labours were truly amazing. On four different\r\noccasions he completed a survey of the firmament, and counted the stars\r\nin several thousand gauge-fields; he discovered 2,400 nebulae, 800\r\ndouble stars, and attempted to ascertain the approximate distances of\r\nthe stars by a comparison of their relative brightness.\r\n\r\nIt had long been surmised, though no actual proof was forthcoming, that\r\nthe law of gravitation by which the order and stability of our system\r\nare maintained exercises its potent influence over other material bodies\r\nexisting in space, and that other systems, though differing in many\r\nrespects from that of ours, and presenting a more complex arrangement in\r\ntheir structure, perform their motions subject to the guidance of this\r\nuniversal law. The uncertainty with regard to the controlling influence\r\nof gravity was removed by Herschel when he made his important discovery\r\nof binary star systems. The components of a binary star are usually in\r\nsuch close proximity that, to the naked eye, they appear as one star,\r\nand sometimes, even with telescopic aid, it is impossible to distinguish\r\nthem individually; but when observed with sufficient magnifying power\r\nthey can be easily perceived as two lucid points. Double stars were for\r\na long time believed to be a purely optical phenomenon--an effect\r\ncreated by two stars projected on the sphere so as to appear nearly in\r\nthe same line of vision, and, although apparently almost in contact,\r\nsituated at great distances apart. At one time Herschel entertained a\r\nsimilar opinion with regard to those stars. In 1779 he undertook an\r\nextensive exploration of the heavens with the object of discovering\r\ndouble stars. As a result of his labours he presented to the Royal\r\nSociety in 1782 a list of 269 newly discovered double stars, and in\r\nthree years after he supplemented this list with another which contained\r\n434 more new stars. He carefully measured the distances by which the\r\ncomponent stars were separated, and determined their position angles, in\r\norder that he might be able to detect the existence of any sensible\r\nparallax. On repeating his observations twenty years after, he\r\ndiscovered that the relative positions of many of the stars had changed,\r\nand in 1802 he made the important announcement of his discovery that the\r\ncomponents of many double stars form independent systems, held together\r\nin a mutual bond of union and revolving round one common centre of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this discovery, which we owe to Herschel's sagacity\r\nand accuracy of observation, cannot be over-estimated; what was\r\npreviously conjecture and surmise, now became precise knowledge\r\nestablished upon a sure and accurate basis. It was ascertained that the\r\nlaw of gravity exerts its power in regulating and controlling the\r\nmotions of all celestial bodies within the range of telescopic vision,\r\nand that the order and harmony which pervade our system are equally\r\npresent among other systems of suns and worlds distributed throughout\r\nthe regions of space. The spectacle of two or more suns revolving round\r\neach other, forming systems of greater magnitude and importance than\r\nthat of ours, conveyed to the minds of astronomers a knowledge of the\r\nmechanism of the heavens which had hitherto been unknown to them.\r\n\r\nDuring the many years which Herschel devoted to the exploration of the\r\nstarry heavens, and when engaged night after night in examining and\r\nenumerating the various groups and clusters of stars which passed before\r\nhis eye in the field of his powerful telescope, he did not fail to\r\nremember the sublime object of his life, and to which he made all his\r\nother investigations subordinate, viz., the delineation of the\r\nstructural configuration of the heavens, and the inclusion of all\r\naggregations, groups, clusters, and galaxies of stars which are\r\napparently scattered promiscuously throughout the regions of space into\r\none grand harmonious design of celestial architecture.\r\n\r\nHaving this object in view, he explored the wondrous zone of the Milky\r\nWay, gauged its depths, measured its dimensions, and, in attempting to\r\nunravel the intricacies of its structure, penetrated its recesses far\r\nbeyond the limit attained by any other observer. Acting on the\r\nassumption that the stars are uniformly distributed throughout space,\r\nHerschel, by his method of star-gauging, concluded that the sidereal\r\nsystem consists of an irregular stratum of evenly distributed suns,\r\nresembling in form a cloven flat disc, and that the apparent richness of\r\nsome regions as compared with that of others could be accounted for by\r\nthe position from which it was viewed by an observer. The stars would\r\nappear least numerous where the visual line was shortest, and, as it\r\nbecame lengthened, they would increase in number until, by crowding\r\nbehind each other as a greater depth of stratum was penetrated, they\r\nwould, when very remote, present the appearance of a luminous cloud or\r\nzone of light. After further observation Herschel was compelled to\r\nrelinquish his theory of equal star distribution, and found, as he\r\napproached the Galaxy, that the stars became much more numerous, and\r\nthat in the Milky Way itself there was evidence of the gravitation of\r\nstars towards certain regions forming aggregations and clusters which\r\nwould ultimately lead to its breaking up into numerous separate sidereal\r\nsystems. As he extended his survey of the heavens and examined with\r\ngreater minuteness the stellar regions in the Galactic tract, he\r\ndiscovered that by his method of star-gauging he was unable to define\r\nthe complexity of structure and variety of arrangement which came under\r\nhis observation; he also perceived that the star-depths are\r\nunfathomable, and discerned that beyond the reach of his telescope there\r\nexisted systems and galaxies of stars situated at an appalling distance\r\nin the abysmal depths of space. Though the magnitude of that portion of\r\nthe sidereal heavens which came under his observation was inconceivable\r\nas regards its dimensions, Herschel was able to perceive that it formed\r\nbut a part--and most probably a small part--of the stellar universe, and\r\nthat without a more extended knowledge of this universe, which at\r\npresent is unattainable, it would be impossible to determine its\r\nstructural configuration or discover the relationships that exist among\r\nthe sidereal systems and Galactic concourses of stars distributed\r\nthroughout space. Herschel ultimately abandoned his star-gauging method\r\nof observation and confined his attention to exploring the star depths\r\nand investigating the laws and theories associated with the bodies\r\noccupying those distant regions.\r\n\r\nSince all the planets if viewed from the Sun would be seen to move\r\nharmoniously and in regular order round that body, so there may be\r\nsomewhere in the universe a central point, or, as some persons imagine,\r\na great central sun, round which all the systems of stars perform their\r\nmajestic revolutions with the same beautiful regularity; having their\r\nmotions controlled by the same law of gravitation, and possessing the\r\nsame dynamical stability which characterises the mechanism of the solar\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the distance which intervenes between our system and the\r\nfixed stars constituted a problem which exercised the minds of\r\nastronomers from an early period until the middle of the present\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe, who repudiated the Copernican theory, asserted as one of\r\nhis reasons against it that the distances by which the heavenly bodies\r\nare separated from each other were greater than even the upholders of\r\nthis theory believed them to be. Although the distance of the Sun from\r\nthe Earth was unknown, Tycho was aware that the diameter of the Earth's\r\norbit must be measured by millions of miles, and yet there was no\r\nperceptible motion or change of position of the stars when viewed from\r\nany point of the vast circumference which she traverses. Consequently,\r\nthe Earth, if viewed from the neighbourhood of a star, would also appear\r\nmotionless, and the dimensions of her orbit would be reduced to that of\r\na point. This seemed incredible to Tycho, and he therefore concluded\r\nthat the Copernican theory was incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion that the stars are orbs resembling our Sun in magnitude\r\nand brilliancy was one which, Tycho urged, should not be hastily\r\nadopted; and yet, if it were conceded that the Earth is a body which\r\nrevolves round the Sun, it would be necessary to admit that the stars\r\nare suns also. If the Earth's orbit, as seen from a star, were reduced\r\nto a point, then the Sun, which occupies its centre, would be reduced to\r\na point of light also, and, when observed from a star of equal\r\nbrilliancy and magnitude, would have the same resemblance that the star\r\nhas when viewed from the Earth, which may be regarded as being in\r\nproximity to the Sun. Tycho Brahe would not admit the accuracy of these\r\nconclusions, which were too bewildering and overwhelming for his mental\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nBut the investigations of later astronomers disclosed the fact that the\r\nheavenly bodies are situated at distances more remote from each other\r\nthan had been previously imagined, and that the reasons which led Tycho\r\nto reject the Copernican theory were based upon erroneous conclusions,\r\nand could, with greater aptitude, be employed in its support. It was\r\nascertained that the distance of the Sun from the Earth, which at\r\ndifferent periods was surmised to be ten, twenty, and forty millions of\r\nmiles, was much greater than had been previously estimated. Later\r\ncalculations determined it to be not less than eighty millions of miles,\r\nand, according to the most recent observations, the distance of the Sun\r\nfrom the Earth is believed to be about ninety-three millions of miles.\r\n\r\nHaving once ascertained the distance between the Earth and the Sun,\r\nastronomers were enabled to determine with greater facility the\r\ndistances of other heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nIt was now known that the diameter of the Earth's orbit exceeded 183\r\nmillions of miles, and yet, with a base line of such enormous length,\r\nand with instruments of the most perfect construction, astronomers were\r\nonly able to perceive the minutest appreciable alteration in the\r\npositions of a few stars when observed from opposite points of the\r\nterrestrial orbit.\r\n\r\nIt had long been the ambitious desire of astronomers to accomplish, if\r\npossible, a measurement of the abyss which separates our system from the\r\nnearest of the fixed stars. No imaginary measuring line had ever been\r\nstretched across this region of space, nor had its unfathomed depths\r\never been sounded by any effort of the human mind. The stars were known\r\nto be inconceivably remote, but how far away no person could tell, nor\r\ndid there exist any guide by which an approximation of their distances\r\ncould be arrived at.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to calculate the distances of the stars, astronomers have\r\nhad recourse to a method called 'Parallax,' by which is meant the\r\napparent change of position of a heavenly body when viewed from two\r\ndifferent points of observation.\r\n\r\nThe annual parallax of a heavenly body is the angle subtended at that\r\nbody by the radius of the Earth's orbit.\r\n\r\nThe stars have no diurnal parallax, because, owing to their great\r\ndistance, the Earth's radius does not subtend any measurable angle, but\r\nthe radius of the Earth's orbit, which is immensely larger, does, in the\r\ncase of a few stars, subtend a very minute angle.\r\n\r\n'This enormous base line of 183 millions of miles is barely sufficient,\r\nin conjunction with the use of the most delicate and powerful\r\nastronomical instruments, to exhibit the minutest measureable\r\ndisplacement of two or three of the nearest stars.'--Proctor.\r\n\r\nThe efforts of early astronomers to detect any perceptible alteration in\r\nthe positions of the stars when observed from any point of the\r\ncircumference of the Earth's orbit were unsuccessful. Copernicus\r\nascribed the absence of any parallax to the immense distances of the\r\nstars as compared with the dimensions of the terrestrial orbit. Tycho\r\nBrahe, though possessing better appliances, and instruments of more\r\nperfect construction, was unable to perceive any annual displacement of\r\nthe stars, and brought this forward as evidence against the Copernican\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nGalileo suggested a method of obtaining the parallax of the fixed stars,\r\nby observing two stars of unequal magnitude apparently near to each\r\nother, though really far apart. Those, when observed from different\r\npoints of the Earth's orbit, would appear to change their positions\r\nrelatively to each other. The smaller and more distant star would remain\r\nunaltered, whilst the larger and nearer star would have changed its\r\nposition with respect to the other. By continuing to observe the larger\r\nstar during the time that the Earth accomplished a revolution of her\r\norbit, Galileo believed that its parallax might be successfully\r\ndetermined. Though he did not himself put this method into practice, it\r\nhas been tried by others with successful results.\r\n\r\nIn 1669, Hooke made the first attempt to ascertain the parallax of a\r\nfixed star, and selected for this purpose Gamma Draconis, a bright star\r\nin the Head of the Dragon. This constellation passed near the zenith of\r\nLondon at the time that he made his observations, and was favourably\r\nsituated, so as to avoid the effects of refraction. Hooke made four\r\nobservations in the months of July, August, and October, and believed\r\nthat he determined the parallax of the star; but it was afterwards\r\ndiscovered that he was in error, and that the apparent displacement of\r\nthe star was mainly due to the aberration of light--a phenomenon which\r\nwas not discovered at that time.\r\n\r\nA few years later, Picard, a French astronomer, attempted to find the\r\nparallax of Alpha Lyrae, but was unsuccessful. In 1692-93, Roemer, a\r\nDanish astronomer, observed irregularities in the declinations of the\r\nstars which could neither be ascribed to parallax or refraction, and\r\nwhich he imagined resulted from a changing position of the Earth's axis.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal causes which baffled astronomers in their\r\nendeavours to determine the parallax of the fixed stars was a phenomenon\r\ncalled the 'Aberration of Light,' which was discovered and explained by\r\nBradley in 1727. The peculiar effect of aberration was perceived by him\r\nwhen endeavouring to obtain the parallax of Gamma Draconis.\r\n\r\nOwing to the progressive transmission of light, conjointly with the\r\nmotion of the Earth in her orbit, there results an apparent slight\r\ndisplacement of a star from its true position. The extent of the\r\ndisplacement depends upon the ratio of the velocity of light as compared\r\nwith the speed of the Earth in her orbit, which is as 10,000 to 1. As a\r\nconsequence of this, each star describes a small ellipse in the course\r\nof a year, the central point of which would indicate the place occupied\r\nby the star if the Earth were at rest. The shifting position of the star\r\nis very slight, and at the end of a year it returns to its former place.\r\n\r\nPrior to the discovery of aberration, astronomers ascribed the apparent\r\ndisplacement of the stars arising from this cause as being due to\r\nparallax--a conclusion which led to erroneous results; but after\r\nBradley's discovery this source of error was avoided, and it was found\r\nthat the parallax of the stars had to be considerably reduced.\r\n\r\nBessel was the first astronomer who merited the high distinction of\r\nhaving determined the first reliable stellar parallax, and by this\r\nachievement he was enabled to fathom the profound abyss which separates\r\nour solar system from the stars.\r\n\r\nFrederick William Bessel was born in 1764 at Minden, in Westphalia. It\r\nwas his intention to pursue a mercantile career, and he commenced life\r\nby becoming apprenticed to a firm of merchants at Bremen. Soon\r\nafterwards he accompanied a trading expedition to China and the East\r\nIndies, and while on this voyage picked up a good deal of information\r\nwith regard to many matters which came under his observation. He\r\nacquired a knowledge of Spanish and English, and made himself acquainted\r\nwith the art of navigation. On his return home, Bessel endeavoured to\r\ndetermine the longitude of Bremen. The only appliances which he made use\r\nof were a sextant constructed by himself, and a common clock; and yet,\r\nwith those rude instruments, he successfully accomplished his object.\r\nDuring the next two years he devoted all his spare time to the study of\r\nmathematics and astronomy, and, having obtained possession of Harriot's\r\nobservations of the celebrated comet of 1607--known as Halley's\r\ncomet--Bessel, after much diligent application and careful calculation,\r\nwas enabled to deduce from them an orbit, which he assigned to that\r\nremarkable body. This meritorious achievement was the means of procuring\r\nfor him a widely known reputation.\r\n\r\nA vacancy for an assistant having occurred at Schroeter's Observatory at\r\nLilienthal, the post was offered to Bessel and accepted by him. Here he\r\nremained for four years, and was afterwards appointed Director of the\r\nnew Prussian Observatory at Koenigsberg, where he pursued his\r\nastronomical labours for a period of upwards of thirty years. Bessel\r\ndirected his energies chiefly to the study of stellar astronomy, and\r\nmade many observations in determining the number, the exact positions,\r\nand proper motions of the stars. He was remarkable for the precision\r\nwith which he carried out his observations, and for the accuracy which\r\ncharacterised all his calculations.\r\n\r\nIn 1837 Bessel, by the exercise of his consummate skill, endeavoured to\r\nsolve a problem which for many years baffled the efforts of the ablest\r\nastronomers, viz., the determination of the parallax of the fixed stars.\r\nThis had been so frequently attempted, and without success, that the\r\nresults of any new observations were received with incredulity before\r\ntheir value could be ascertained.\r\n\r\nBessel was ably assisted by Joseph Frauenhofer, an eminent optician of\r\nMunich, who constructed a magnificent heliometer for the Observatory at\r\nKoenigsberg, and in its design introduced a principle which admirably\r\nadapted it for micrometrical measurement.\r\n\r\nThe star selected by Bessel is a binary known as 61 Cygni, the\r\ncomponents being of magnitudes 5.5 and 6 respectively. It has a large\r\nproper motion, which led him to conclude that its parallax must be\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThis star will always be an object of interest to astronomers, as it was\r\nthe first of the stellar multitude that revealed to Bessel the secret of\r\nits distance.\r\n\r\nBessel commenced his observations in October 1837, and continued them\r\nuntil March 1840. During this time he made 402 measurements, and, before\r\narriving at a conclusive result, carefully considered every imaginable\r\ncause of error, and rigorously calculated any inaccuracies that might\r\narise therefrom. Finally, he determined the parallax of the star to be\r\n0''.3483--a result equivalent to a distance about 600,000 times that of\r\nthe Earth from the Sun. In 1842-43 M. Peters, of the Pulkova\r\nObservatory, arrived at an almost similar result, having obtained a\r\nparallax of 0''.349; but by more recent observations the parallax of the\r\nstar has been increased to about half a second.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that Bessel was occupied with his observation of 61\r\nCygni, Professor Henderson, of Edinburgh, when in charge of the\r\nObservatory at the Cape of Good Hope, directed his attention to Alpha\r\nCentauri, one of the brightest stars in the Southern Hemisphere. During\r\n1832-33 he made a series of observations of the star, with the object\r\nof ascertaining its mean declination; and, having been informed\r\nafterwards of its large proper motion, he resolved to make an endeavour\r\nto determine its parallax. This he accomplished after his return to\r\nScotland, having been appointed Astronomer Royal in that country. By an\r\nexamination of the observations made by him at the Cape, he determined\r\nthe parallax of Alpha Centauri to be 1''.16, but later astronomers have\r\nreduced it to 0''.75.\r\n\r\nProfessor Henderson's detection of the parallax of Alpha Centauri was\r\ncommunicated to the Astronomical Society two months after Bessel\r\nannounced his determination of the parallax of 61 Cygni.\r\n\r\nThe parallax of 61 Cygni assigns to the star a distance of forty\r\nbillions of miles from the Earth, and that of Alpha Centauri--regarded\r\nas the nearest star to our system--a distance of twenty-five billions of\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nIt is utterly beyond the capacity of the human mind to form any adequate\r\nconception of those vast distances, even when measured by the velocity\r\nwith which the ether of space is thrilled into light. Light, which\r\ntravels twelve millions of miles in a minute, requires 4-1/3 years to\r\ncross the abyss which intervenes between Alpha Centauri and the Earth,\r\nand from 61 Cygni the period required for light to reach our globe is\r\nrather less than double that time.\r\n\r\nThe parallax of more than a dozen other stars has been determined, and\r\nthe light passage of a few of the best known is estimated as\r\nfollows:--Sirius, eight years; Procyon, twelve; Altair, sixteen;\r\nAldebaran, twenty-eight; Capella, thirty; Regulus, thirty-five; Polaris,\r\nsixty-three; and Vega, ninety-six years.\r\n\r\nIt does not always follow that the brightest stars are those situated\r\nnearest to our system, though in a general way this may be regarded as\r\ncorrect. The diminishing magnitudes of the stars can be accounted for\r\nmainly by their increased distances, rather than by any difference in\r\ntheir intrinsic brilliancy. We should not err by inferring that the most\r\nminute stars are also the most remote; the telescope revealing thousands\r\nthat are invisible to the naked eye. There are, however, exceptions to\r\nthis general rule, and there are many stars of small magnitude less\r\nremote than those whose names have been enumerated, and whose light\r\npassage testifies to their profound distances and surpassing magnitude\r\nwhen compared with that of our Sun.\r\n\r\nSirius, 'the leader of the heavenly host,' is distant fifty billions of\r\nmiles. The orb shines with a brilliancy far surpassing that of the Sun,\r\nand greatly exceeds him in mass and dimensions. Arcturus, the bright\r\nstar in Booetes, whose golden yellow light renders it such a conspicuous\r\nobject, is so far distant that its measurement gives no reliable\r\nparallax; and if we may infer from what little we know of the stars,\r\nArcturus is believed to be the most magnificent and massive orb entering\r\ninto the structure of that portion of the sidereal system which comes\r\nwithin our cognisance. Judging by its relative size and brightness,\r\nthis star is ten thousand times more luminous, and may exceed the Sun\r\none million times in volume.\r\n\r\nDeneb, in the constellation of the Swan, though a first-magnitude star,\r\npossesses no perceptible proper motion or parallax--a circumstance\r\nindicative of amazing distance, and magnitude equalling, or surpassing,\r\nArcturus and Sirius.\r\n\r\nCanopus, in the constellation Argo, in the Southern Hemisphere, the\r\nbrightest star in the heavens with the exception of Sirius, possesses no\r\nsensible parallax; consequently, its distance is unknown, though it has\r\nbeen estimated that its light passage cannot be less than sixty-five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBy establishing a mean value for the parallax of stars of different\r\nmagnitudes, it was believed that an approximation of their distances\r\ncould be obtained by calculating the time occupied in their light\r\npassage. The light period for stars of the first magnitude has been\r\nestimated at thirty-six and a half years; this applies to the brightest\r\nstars, which are also regarded as the nearest. At the distance indicated\r\nby this period, the Sun would shrink to the dimensions of a\r\nseventh-magnitude star and become invisible to the naked eye; this of\r\nitself affords sufficient proof that the great luminary of our system\r\ncannot be regarded as one of the leading orbs of the firmament. Stars of\r\nthe second magnitude have a mean distance of fifty-eight light years,\r\nthose of the third magnitude ninety-two years, and so on. M. Peters\r\nestimated that light from stars of the sixth magnitude, which are just\r\nvisible to the naked eye, requires a period of 138 years to accomplish\r\nits journey hither; whilst light emitted from the smallest stars visible\r\nin large telescopes does not reach the Earth until after the lapse of\r\nthousands of years from the time of leaving its source.\r\n\r\nThe profound distances of the nearest stars by which we are surrounded\r\nlead us to consider the isolated position of the solar system in space.\r\nA pinnacle of rock, or forsaken raft floating in mid-ocean, is not more\r\ndistant from the shore than is the Sun from his nearest neighbours. The\r\ninconceivable dimensions of the abyss by which the orb and his\r\nattendants are surrounded in utter loneliness may be partially\r\ncomprehended when it is known that light, which travels from the Sun to\r\nthe Earth--a distance of ninety-three millions of miles--in eight\r\nminutes, requires a period of four and a third years to reach us from\r\nthe nearest fixed star. A sphere having the Sun at its centre and this\r\nnearest star at its circumference would have a diameter of upwards of\r\nfifty billions of miles; the volume of the orb when compared with the\r\ndimensions of this circular vacuity of space is as a small shot to a\r\nglobe 900 miles in diameter. It has been estimated by Father Secchi\r\nthat, if a comet when at aphelion were to arrive at a point midway\r\nbetween the Sun and the nearest fixed star, it would require one hundred\r\nmillion years in the accomplishment of its journey thither. And yet the\r\nSun is one of a group of stars which occupy a region of the heavens\r\nadjacent to the Milky Way and surrounded by that zone; nor is his\r\nisolation greater than that of those stars which are his companions, and\r\nwho, notwithstanding their profound distance, influence his movements by\r\ntheir gravitational attraction, and in combination with the other stars\r\nof the firmament control his destiny.\r\n\r\nAncient astronomers, for the purpose of description, have mapped out the\r\nheavens into numerous irregular divisions called 'constellations.' They\r\nare of various forms and sizes, according to the configuration of the\r\nstars which occupy them, and have been named after different animals,\r\nmythological heroes, and other objects which they appear to resemble. In\r\na few instances there does exist a similitude to the object after which\r\na constellation is called; this is evident in the case of Corona\r\nBorealis (the Northern Crown), in which there can be seen a conspicuous\r\narrangement of stars resembling a coronet, and in the constellations of\r\nthe Dolphin and Scorpion, where the stars are so distributed that the\r\nforms of those creatures can be readily recognised. There is some slight\r\nresemblance to a bear in Ursa Major, and to a lion in Leo, and no great\r\neffort of the mind is required to imagine a chair in Cassiopeia, and a\r\ngiant in Orion; but in the majority of instances it is difficult to\r\nperceive any likeness of the object after which a constellation is\r\nnamed, and in many cases there is no resemblance whatever.\r\n\r\nThe constellations are sixty-seven in number: excluding those of the\r\nZodiac, which have been already mentioned, the constellations of the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere number twenty-nine. The most important of these are\r\nUrsa Major and Minor, Andromeda, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Cygnus, Lyra,\r\nAquila, Auriga, Draco, Booetes, Hercules, Pegasus, and Corona Borealis.\r\n\r\nTo an observer of the nocturnal sky the stars appear to be very\r\nunequally distributed over the celestial sphere. In some regions they\r\nare few in number and of small magnitude, whilst in other parts of the\r\nheavens, and especially in the vicinity of the Milky Way, they are\r\npresent in great numbers and form groups and aggregations of striking\r\nappearance and conspicuous brilliancy. On taking a casual glance at the\r\nmidnight sky on a clear moonless night, one is struck with the apparent\r\ncountless multitude of the stars; yet this impression of their vast\r\nnumber is deceptive, for not more than two thousand stars are usually\r\nvisible at one time.\r\n\r\nMuch, however, depends upon the keenness of vision of the observer, and\r\nthe transparency of the atmosphere. Argelander counted at Bonn more than\r\n3,000 stars, and Hozeau, near the equator, where all the stars of the\r\nsphere successively appear in view, enumerated 6,000 stars. This number\r\nmay be regarded as including all the stars in the heavens that are\r\nvisible to the naked eye. With the aid of an opera glass thousands of\r\nstars can be seen that are imperceptible to ordinary vision.\r\nArgelander, with a small telescope of 2-1/2 inches aperture, was able to\r\ncount 234,000 stars in the Northern Hemisphere. Large telescopes reveal\r\nmultitudes of stars utterly beyond the power of enumeration, nor do they\r\nappear to diminish in number as depth after depth of space is penetrated\r\nby powerful instruments. The star-population of the heavens has been\r\nreckoned at 100,000,000, but this estimate is merely an assumption;\r\nrecent discoveries made by means of stellar photography indicate that\r\nthe stars exist in myriads. It is reasonable to believe that there is a\r\nlimit to the sidereal universe, but it is impossible to assign its\r\nbounds or comprehend the apparently infinite extent of its dimensions.\r\n\r\nScintillation or twinkling of the stars is a property which\r\ndistinguishes them from the planets. It is due to a disturbed condition\r\nof the atmosphere and is most apparent when a star is near the horizon;\r\nat the zenith it almost entirely vanishes. Humboldt states that in the\r\nclear air of Cumana, in South America, the stars do not twinkle after\r\nthey reach an elevation of 15 deg. above the horizon. The presence of\r\nmoisture in the atmosphere intensifies scintillation, and this is\r\nusually regarded as a prognostication of rain. White stars twinkle more\r\nthan red ones. The occurrence of scintillation can be accounted for by\r\nthe fact that the stars are visible as single points of light which\r\ntwinkle as a whole, but in the case of the Sun, Moon, and planets, they\r\nform discs from which many points of light are emitted; they,\r\ntherefore, do not scintillate as a whole, for the absence of rays of\r\nlight from one portion of their surface is compensated by those from\r\nother parts of their discs, giving a mean average which creates a\r\nsteadiness of vision.\r\n\r\nThe stars are divided into separate classes called 'magnitudes,' by\r\nwhich their relative apparent size and degree of brightness are\r\ndistinguished. The magnitude of a star does not indicate its mass or\r\ndimensions, but its light-giving power, which depends partly upon its\r\nsize and distance, though mainly upon the intensity of its luminosity.\r\nThe most conspicuous are termed stars of the first magnitude; there are\r\nten of those in the Northern Hemisphere, and an equal number south of\r\nthe equator, but they are not all of the same brilliancy. Sirius\r\noutshines every other star of the firmament, and Arcturus has no rival\r\nin the northern heavens. The names of the first-magnitude stars north of\r\nthe equator are: Arcturus, Capella, Vega, Betelgeux, Procyon, Aldebaran,\r\nAltair, Pollux, Regulus, and Deneb. The next class in order of\r\nbrightness are called second-magnitude stars; they are fifty or sixty in\r\nnumber, the most important of which is the Pole Star. The stars diminish\r\nin luminosity by successive gradations, and when they sink to the sixth\r\nmagnitude reach the utmost limit at which they appear visible to the\r\nnaked eye. In great telescopes this classification is carried so low as\r\nto include stars of the eighteenth and twentieth magnitudes.\r\n\r\nEntering into the structure of the stellar universe we have Single\r\nStars, Double Stars, Triple, Quadruple, and Multiple Stars, Temporary,\r\nPeriodical, and Variable Stars, Star-groups, Star-clusters, Galaxies,\r\nand Nebulae.\r\n\r\nSINGLE OR INSULATED STARS include all those orbs sufficiently isolated\r\nin space so as not to be perceptibly influenced by the attraction of\r\nother similar bodies. They are believed to constitute the centres of\r\nplanetary systems, and fulfil the purpose for which they were created by\r\ndispensing light and heat to the worlds which circle around them.\r\n\r\nThe Sun is an example of this class of star, and constitutes the centre\r\nof the system to which the Earth belongs. Reasoning from analogy, it\r\nwould be natural to conclude that there are other suns, numberless\r\nbeyond conception, the centres of systems of revolving worlds, and\r\nalthough we are utterly unable to catch a glimpse of their planetary\r\nattendants, even with the aid of the most powerful telescopes, yet they\r\nhave in a few instances been _felt_, and have afforded unmistakable\r\nindications of their existence.\r\n\r\nSince the Sun must be regarded as one of the stellar multitude that\r\npeople the regions of space, and whose surpassing splendour when\r\ncontrasted with that of other luminaries can be accounted for by his\r\nproximity to us, it would be of interest to ascertain his relative\r\nimportance when compared with other celestial orbs which may be his\r\npeers or his superiors in magnitude and brilliancy.\r\n\r\nThe Sun is one of a widely scattered group of stars situated in the\r\nplane of the Milky Way and surrounded by that zone, and, as a star among\r\nthe stars, would be included in the constellation of the Centaur.\r\n\r\nAlthough regarded as one of the leading orbs of the firmament, and of\r\nsupreme importance to us, astronomers are undecided whether to classify\r\nthe Sun with stars of greater magnitude and brightness, or assign him a\r\nposition among minor orbs of smaller size. Much uncertainty exists with\r\nregard to star magnitudes. This arises from inability on the part of\r\nastronomers to ascertain the distances of the vast majority of stars\r\nvisible to the naked eye, and also on account of inequality in their\r\nintrinsic brilliancy. Among the stars there exists an indefinite range\r\nof stellar magnitudes. There are many stars known whose dimensions have\r\nbeen ascertained to greatly exceed those of the Sun, and there are\r\nothers of much smaller size. No approximation of the magnitude of\r\ntelescopic stars can be arrived at; many of them may rival Sirius,\r\nCanopus, and Arcturus, in size and splendour, their apparent minuteness\r\nbeing a consequence of their extreme remoteness. If the Sun were removed\r\na distance in space equal to that of many of the brightest stars, he\r\nwould in appearance be reduced to a minute point of light or become\r\naltogether invisible; and there are other stars, situated at distances\r\nstill more remote, of which sufficient is known to justify us in\r\narriving at the conclusion that the Sun must be ranked among the minor\r\norbs of the firmament, and that many of the stars surpass him in\r\nbrilliancy and magnitude.\r\n\r\nDOUBLE STARS.--To the unaided eye, these appear as single points of\r\nlight; but, when observed with a telescope of sufficient magnifying\r\npower, their dual nature can be detected.\r\n\r\nThe first double star discovered was Mizar, the middle star of the three\r\nin Ursa Major which form the tail of the bear. The components are of the\r\nfourth and fifth magnitudes, of a brilliant white colour, and distant\r\nfourteen seconds of arc.\r\n\r\nIn 1678, Cassini perceived stars which appeared as single points of\r\nlight when viewed with the naked eye, but when observed with the\r\ntelescope presented the appearance of being double.\r\n\r\nThe astronomer Bode, in 1781, published a list of eighty double stars,\r\nand, in a few years after, Sir William Herschel discovered several\r\nhundreds more of those objects. They are now known to exist in\r\nthousands, Mr. Burnham, of the Lick Observatory, having, by his keen\r\nperception of vision, contributed more than any other observer to swell\r\ntheir number.\r\n\r\nAll double stars are not binaries; many of them are known as 'optical\r\ndoubles'--an impression created by two stars when almost in the same\r\nline of vision, and, though apparently near, are situated at a great\r\ndistance apart and devoid of any physical relationship.\r\n\r\nBinary stars consist of two suns which revolve round their common\r\ncentre of gravity, and form real dual systems.\r\n\r\nThe close proximity of the components of double stars impressed the\r\nminds of some astronomers with the belief that a physical bond of union\r\nexisted between them. In the interval between 1718 and 1759, Bradley\r\ndetected a change of 30 deg. in the position angle of the two stars forming\r\nCastor, and was very nearly discovering their physical connection.\r\n\r\nIn 1767, the Rev. John Michell wrote: 'It is highly probable in\r\nparticular, and next to a certainty in general, that such double stars\r\nas appear to consist of two or more stars placed very near together do\r\nreally consist of stars placed near together and under the influence of\r\nsome general law.' Afterwards he says: 'It is not improbable that a few\r\nyears may inform us that some of the great number of double and triple\r\nstars which have been observed by Mr. Herschel are systems of bodies\r\nrevolving about each other.' Christian Mayer, a German astronomer,\r\nformed a list of stellar pairs, and announced, in 1776, the supposed\r\ndiscovery of 'satellites' to many of the principal stars. His\r\nobservations were, however, not exact enough to lead to any useful\r\nresults, and the existence of his 'planet stars' was at that time\r\nderided, and believed to find a place only in his imagination.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions arrived at by some astronomers with regard to double\r\nstars were afterwards confirmed by Herschel, when, by his observation of\r\na change in the relative positions of many of their components, he was\r\nable to announce that they form independent systems in mutual\r\nrevolution, and are controlled by the law of gravitation.\r\n\r\nThe number of binary stars in active revolution is known to exceed 500;\r\nbut, besides these, there are doubtless numerous other compound stars\r\nwhich, on account of their extreme remoteness and the close proximity of\r\ntheir components, are irresolvable into pairs by any optical appliances\r\nwhich we possess.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of two suns in one sphere presents to our observation a\r\nscheme of creative design entirely different to the single-star system\r\nwith which we are familiar--one of a higher and more complex order in\r\nthe ascending scale of celestial architecture. For, if we assume that\r\naround each revolving sun there circles a retinue of planetary worlds,\r\nit is obvious that a much more complicated arrangement must exist among\r\nthe orbs which enter into the formation of such a system than is found\r\namong those which gravitate round our Sun.\r\n\r\nThe common centre of gravity of a binary system is situated on a line\r\nbetween both stars, and distant from each in inverse proportion to their\r\nrespective masses. When the stars are of equal mass their orbits are of\r\nequal dimensions, but when the mass of one star exceeds that of the\r\nother, the orbit of the larger star is proportionately diminished as\r\ncompared with the circumference traversed by the smaller star. When\r\ntheir orbits are circular--a rare occurrence--both stars pursue each\r\nother in the same path, and invariably occupy it at diametrically\r\nopposite points; nor is it possible for one star to approach the other\r\nby the minutest interval of space in any duration of time, so long as\r\nthe synchronous harmony of their revolution remains undisturbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--A Binary Star System--70 Ophiuchi\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Mr. J. E. Gore._)]\r\n\r\nWhen a pair of suns move in an ellipse, their orbits intersect and are\r\nof equal dimensions when the stars are of equal mass, their common\r\ncentre of gravity being then at a point equidistant from each.\r\nConsequently, neither star can approach or recede from this point\r\nwithout the other affecting a similar motion, they must be at periastron\r\nand apastron together, and any acceleration or retardation of speed must\r\noccur simultaneously with each. Stars of unequal magnitude always\r\nmaintain a proportionate distance from their common focus, and both\r\nsimultaneously occupy corresponding parts of their orbits.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the motions of those distant suns, and the form of the\r\norbits which they traverse, have been investigated by several eminent\r\nastronomers, and although the subject is one of much difficulty, on\r\naccount of their extreme remoteness and the minute angles which have to\r\nbe dealt with, necessitating the carrying out of very refined\r\nobservations, yet a considerable amount of information has been obtained\r\nwith regard to the paths which they pursue in the accomplishment of\r\ntheir revolutions round each other.\r\n\r\nThe orbits of about sixty stellar pairs have been computed, but only\r\nwith partial success. Some stars have shown themselves to be totally\r\nregardless of theory and computation, and have shot ahead far beyond the\r\nlimits ascribed to them, whilst others, by the slowness of their\r\nmotions, have upset the calculations of astronomers as much in the\r\nopposite direction. So that out of this number the orbits of not more\r\nthan half a dozen are satisfactorily known.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of stellar orbits are of very varied extent. Some pairs\r\nare apparently so close that the best optical means which we possess are\r\nincapable of dividing them, whilst others revolve in wide and spacious\r\norbits.\r\n\r\nThe most marked peculiarity of the orbits of binary stars is their high\r\neccentricity; they are usually much more eccentric than are those of\r\nthe planets, and in some instances approach in form that of a comet.\r\n\r\nThe finest binary star in the northern heavens is Castor, the brighter\r\nof the two leading stars in the constellation Gemini. The components are\r\nof the second and third magnitudes, and over five seconds apart. They\r\nare of a brilliant white colour, and form a beautiful object in the\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nIn 1719 Bradley determined the relative positions of those stars, and on\r\ncomparing the results obtained by him with recent measurements it was\r\nfound that they had altered to the extent of 125 deg.. Travelling at the\r\nsame rate of speed, they will require a period of about 420 years to\r\ncomplete an entire circuit of their orbits. This pace, however, has not\r\nbeen maintained, for, their periastron having occurred in 1750, they\r\ntravelled more rapidly in the last century than they are doing at\r\npresent, and, as their orbits are so eccentric that when at apastron the\r\nstars are twice as remote from each other as at periastron, they will\r\nfor the next three and a half centuries continue to slacken their pace,\r\nuntil they shall have reached the most remote points of their orbits,\r\nwhen they will again begin to approach with an increasing velocity; so\r\nthat the time in which an entire revolution can be accomplished will not\r\nbe much less than 1,000 years.[8]\r\n\r\nAs the distance of Castor is unknown, it is impossible to compute the\r\ncombined mass of its components. They are very remote, their light\r\nperiod being estimated at forty-four years. Castor is doubtless a more\r\nmassive orb than our Sun, and possesses a higher degree of luminosity.\r\n\r\nAlpha Centauri, in the Southern Hemisphere, is the brightest binary, and\r\nalso the nearest known star in the heavens; its estimated distance being\r\ntwenty-five billions of miles. Both components equal stars of the first\r\nmagnitude, and are of a brilliant white colour. Since they were first\r\nobserved, in 1709, they have completed two revolutions, and are now\r\naccomplishing a third. The eccentricity of their orbit approaches in\r\nform that of Faye's comet, which travels round the Sun; consequently the\r\nstars, when at apastron, are twice their periastron distance. Their\r\nperiod of revolution is about eighty-eight years. The mean radius of\r\ntheir orbit corresponds to a span of 1,000 millions of miles, so that\r\nthose orbs are sometimes as close to each other as Jupiter is to the\r\nSun, and never so far distant as Uranus.[9] Their combined mass is twice\r\nthat of the Sun, and the luminosity of each star is slightly greater.\r\n\r\nThe double star 61 Cygni--one of the nearest to our system--is believed\r\nto be a binary the components of which move in an orbit of more spacious\r\ndimensions than that of any other known revolving pair. Though they have\r\nbeen under continuous observation since 1753, it is only within the last\r\nfew years that any orbital motion has been perceived. Some observers\r\nare disinclined to admit the accuracy of this statement; whilst others\r\nbelieve that the stars have executed a hyperbolic sweep round their\r\ncommon centre of gravity and are now separating.\r\n\r\nThe radius of the orbit in which those bodies travel is sixty-five times\r\nthe distance of the Earth from the Sun; which means that they travel in\r\nan orbit twice the width of that of the planet Neptune. It has been\r\nestimated that they complete a revolution in about eight centuries. The\r\nunited mass of the system is about one-half that of the Sun, and in\r\npoint of luminosity they are much inferior to that orb.\r\n\r\nThe star 70 Ophiuchi (fig. 3) may be regarded as typical of a binary\r\nsystem. The components are five seconds apart, and of the fourth and\r\nsixth magnitudes. Their light period is stated to be twenty years, and\r\nthe combined mass of the system is nearly three times that of the Sun.\r\nThe pair travel in an orbit from fourteen to forty-two times the radius\r\nof the Earth's orbit; so that when at apastron they are three times as\r\ndistant from each other as when at periastron. They complete a\r\nrevolution in eighty-eight years.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram (fig. 4) is a delineation of the beautiful\r\norbits of the components of Gamma Virginis. These may be described as\r\nelongated ellipses. Both stars being of equal mass, their orbits are of\r\nequal dimensions, and their common centre of gravity at a point\r\nequidistant from each. Any approach to, or recession from this point,\r\nmust occur simultaneously with each; they must always occupy\r\ncorresponding parts of their orbits, and be in apastron and at\r\nperiastron in the same period of time. The ellipse described by this\r\npair is the most eccentric of known binary orbits, and approaches in\r\nform the path pursued by Encke's comet round the Sun. These orbs\r\ncomplete a revolution in 180 years, and when in apastron are seventeen\r\ntimes more remote from each other than when at periastron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--The Orbits of the Components of Gamma Virginis.]\r\n\r\nFrom his observation of the motion of Sirius in 1844, Bessel was led to\r\nbelieve that the brilliant orb was accompanied by another body, whose\r\ngravitational attraction was responsible for the irregularities observed\r\nin the path of the great dog-star when pursuing his journey through\r\nspace. The elements of this hypothetical body were afterwards computed\r\nby Peters and Auwers, and its exact position assigned by Safford in\r\n1861.\r\n\r\nOn January 31, 1862, Mr. Alvan Clarke, of Cambridgeport, Massachusetts,\r\nwhen engaged in testing a recently constructed telescope of great power,\r\ndirected it on Sirius, and was enabled by good fortune to discover the\r\ncompanion star at a distance of ten seconds from its primary. Since its\r\ndiscovery, the star has pursued with such precision the theoretical path\r\npreviously assigned to it that astronomers have had no hesitation in\r\nidentifying it as the hypothetical body whose existence Bessel had\r\ncorrectly surmised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Apparent Orbit of the Companion of Sirius.\r\n\r\n(_Drawn by Mr. Burnham._)]\r\n\r\nThe Sirian satellite is a yellow star of the eighth magnitude, and\r\nshines with a feeble light when contrasted with the surpassing\r\nbrilliancy of its neighbour.\r\n\r\nAstronomers were for some time in doubt as to whether the uneven motion\r\nwhich characterised the path of Sirius could be ascribed to the\r\nattraction of its obscure attendant, which presented such a marked\r\ncontrast to its primary, and several observers were inclined to believe\r\nthat the disturbing body still remained undiscovered. When, however, the\r\ndensity of the lesser star became known, it was discovered that, weight\r\nfor weight, that of Sirius exceeded it only in the proportion of two to\r\none, though as a light-giver the great orb is believed to be 5,000 times\r\nmore luminous. The Sirian satellite revolves round its primary in about\r\nfifty years, and at a distance twenty-eight times that of the Earth from\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\nThe surpassing brilliancy of Sirius as compared with that of the other\r\nstars of the firmament has rendered it at all times an object of\r\ninterest to observers. The Egyptians worshipped the star as Sothis, and\r\nit was believed to be the abode of the soul of Isis. The nations\r\ninhabiting the region of the Nile commenced their year with the heliacal\r\nrising of Sirius, and its appearance was regarded as a sure forerunner\r\nof the rising of the great river, the fertilising flood of which was\r\nattributed to the influence of this beautiful star. It is believed that\r\nthe Mazzaroth in Job is an allusion to this brilliant orb. Among the\r\nRomans Sirius was regarded as a star of evil omen; its appearance above\r\nthe horizon after the summer solstice was believed to be associated with\r\npestilence and fevers, consequent upon the oppressive heat of the\r\nseason of the year. The _dies caniculares_, or dog-days, were reckoned\r\nto begin twenty days before, and to continue for twenty days after, the\r\nheliacal rising of Sirius, the dog-star. During those days a peculiar\r\ninfluence was believed to exist which created diseases in men and\r\nmadness among dogs. Homer alludes to the star\r\n\r\n                                'whose burning breath\r\n    Taints the red air with fevers, plagues and death.'\r\n\r\nSirius, which is in Canis Major (one of Orion's hunting dogs), is a far\r\nmore glorious orb than our Sun. According to recent photometric\r\nmeasurements it emits seventy times the quantity of light, and is three\r\ntimes more massive than the great luminary of our system. At the\r\ndistance of Sirius (fifty billions of miles) the Sun would shrink to the\r\ndimensions of a third-magnitude star, and the light of seventy such\r\nstars would be required to equal in appearance the brilliant radiance of\r\nthe great dog-star. The orb, with his retinue of attendant worlds--some\r\nof which are reported as having been seen--is travelling through space\r\nwith a velocity of not less than 1,000 miles a minute.\r\n\r\nAn irregularity of motion resembling that of Sirius has been detected\r\nwith regard to Procyon, the lesser dog-star. But in this case the\r\ncompanion star has not as yet been seen, though a careful search has\r\nbeen made for it with the most powerful of telescopes. Should it be a\r\nplanetary body, illumined by its primary, its reflected light would not\r\nappear visible to us, even if it were much less remote than it is.\r\n\r\nWe are able only to perceive the effulgence of brilliant suns scattered\r\nthroughout the regions of space; but besides those, there are doubtless\r\nmany faintly luminous orbs and opaque bodies of vast dimensions\r\noccupying regions unknown to us, but by a knowledge of the existence of\r\nwhich an enlarged conception is conveyed to our minds of the greatness\r\nof the universe.\r\n\r\nThe most rapid of known revolving pairs is Delta Equulei. The components\r\nare so close that only the finest instruments can separate them, and\r\nthis they cannot do at all times. They accomplish a revolution in eleven\r\nand a half years. The slowest revolving pair is Zeta Aquarii. The motion\r\nof the components is so tardy that to complete a circuit of their orbits\r\nthey require a period of about sixteen centuries. Other binary stars\r\nhave had different periods assigned to them; eleven pairs have been\r\ncomputed to revolve round each other in less than fifty years, and\r\nfifteen in less than 100 but more than fifty. There are other compound\r\nstars whose motions appear to be much more leisurely than those just\r\nmentioned, and although no orbital movement has, so far, been detected\r\namong them, yet, so vast is the scale upon which the sidereal system is\r\nconstructed, that thousands of years must elapse before they can have\r\naccomplished a revolution of their orbits.\r\n\r\nThe Pole Star is an optical double, but the components are of very\r\nunequal magnitude. The Pole Star itself is of the second magnitude, but\r\nits companion is only of the ninth, and on account of its minuteness is\r\nregarded as a good test for telescopes of small aperture. Mizar, in the\r\nconstellation Ursa Major, is a beautiful double star. The components are\r\nwide apart, and can be easily observed with a small instrument.\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable star in the constellation of the Lyre (Epsilon\r\nLyrae), described as a double double. This object can just be\r\ndistinguished by a person with keen eyesight as consisting of two stars;\r\nwhen observed with a telescope they appear widely separated, and each\r\nstar is seen to have a companion, the entire system forming two binary\r\npairs in active revolution. The pair which first cross the meridian\r\ncomplete a revolution in about 2,000 years; the second pair have a more\r\nrapid motion, and accomplish it in half that time. The two pairs are\r\nbelieved to be physically connected, and revolve round their common\r\ncentre of gravity in a period of time not much under one million years.\r\n\r\nCor Caroli, in Canes Venatici, is a pleasing double star, the components\r\nbeing of a pale white and lilac colour.\r\n\r\nAlbireo, in the constellation of the Swan, is one of the loveliest of\r\ndouble stars. The larger component is of the third magnitude, and of a\r\ngolden yellow colour; the smaller of the sixth magnitude, and of a\r\nsapphire blue.\r\n\r\nEpsilon Booetis, known also as Mirac, and called by Admiral Smyth\r\n'Pulcherrima,' on account of its surpassing beauty, is a delicate object\r\nof charming appearance. The components of this lovely star are of the\r\nthird and seventh magnitudes: the primary orange, the secondary\r\nsea-green.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. R. A. Proctor, in describing a binary star system, writes\r\nas follows: 'If we regard a pair of stars as forming a double sun, round\r\nwhich--or, rather, round the common centre of which--other orbs revolve\r\nas planets, we are struck by the difference between such a scheme and\r\nour own solar system; but we find the difference yet more surprising\r\nwhen we consider the possibility that in some such schemes each\r\ncomponent sun may have its own distinct system of dependent worlds. In\r\nthe former case the ordinary state of things would probably be such that\r\nboth suns would be above the horizon at the same time, and then,\r\nprobably, their distinctive peculiarities would only be recognisable\r\nwhen one chanced to pass over the disc of the other, as our Moon passes\r\nover the Sun's disc in eclipses. For short intervals of time, however,\r\nat rising or setting, one or other would be visible alone; and the\r\nphenomena of sunset and sunrise must therefore be very varied, and also\r\nexquisitely beautiful, in worlds circling round such double suns. But\r\nwhen each sun has a separate system, even more remarkable relations must\r\nbe presented. For each system of dependent worlds, besides its own\r\nproper sun, must have another sun--less splendid, perhaps (because\r\nfarther off), but still brighter beyond comparison than our moon at the\r\nfull. And, according to the position of any planet of either system,\r\nthere will result for the time being either an interchange of suns,\r\ninstead of the change from night to day, or else double sunlight during\r\nthe day, and a corresponding intensified contrast between night and day.\r\nWhere the two suns are very unequal or very differently coloured, or\r\nwhere the orbital path of each is very eccentric, so that they are\r\nsometimes close together and at others far apart, the varieties in the\r\nworlds circling round either, or around the common centre of both, must\r\nbe yet more remarkable. \"It must be confessed,\" we may well say with Sir\r\nJohn Herschel, \"that we have here a strangely wide and novel field for\r\nspeculative excursions, and one which it is not easy to avoid\r\nluxuriating in.\"'\r\n\r\nAnyone who takes a cursory glance at the heavens on a clear night can\r\nreadily perceive that there exists considerable diversity of colour\r\namong the stars. The contrast between some is pronounced and well\r\nmarked, whilst others exhibit refined gradations of hue.\r\n\r\nThe most numerous class of stars are those which are described as white\r\nor colourless. They comprise about one-half of the stars visible to the\r\nnaked eye. Among the most conspicuous examples of this type are\r\nSirius--whose diamond blaze is sometimes mingled with an occasional\r\nflash of blue and red--Altair, Spica, Castor, Regulus, Rigel, all the\r\nstars of Ursa Major with the exception of one, and Vega--a glittering\r\ngem of pale sapphire, almost colourless. The light emitted by stars of\r\nthis class gives a continuous spectrum, the predominating element being\r\nhydrogen, having a very elevated temperature and under relatively high\r\npressure. The vapours of iron, sodium, magnesium, and other metals, are\r\nindicated as existing in small quantities.\r\n\r\nThe second class of stars is that to which our Sun belongs. They are of\r\na yellow colour, and embrace two-thirds of the remaining stars. The most\r\nprominent examples of this type are Arcturus, Capella, Aldebaran,\r\nProcyon, and Pollux. Hydrogen does not predominate so much in these as\r\nin the Sirian stars, and their spectra resemble closely the solar\r\nspectrum, indicating that they are composed of elements similar to those\r\nwhich exist in the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe star which bears the nearest resemblance to our Sun, both as regards\r\nthe colour of its light and physical structure, is Capella, the most\r\nconspicuous star in the constellation Auriga, and one of the leading\r\nbrilliants in the Northern Hemisphere. Its spectrum presents all the\r\ncharacteristics observed in the solar spectrum, and there exists an\r\nalmost identical similarity in their physical constitution, though\r\nCapella is a much more magnificent orb than the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe third class of stars includes those which are of a ruddy hue, such\r\nas Betelgeux in the right shoulder of Orion, Antares in Scorpio, and\r\nAlpha Herculis. Their spectra present a banded or columnar appearance,\r\nand there is greater absorption, especially of the blue rays of light.\r\nIt is believed that the temperature of stars of this colour is not so\r\nelevated as that of those belonging to the other two orders, and that\r\nthis is a sufficient reason to account for the different appearance of\r\ntheir spectra.\r\n\r\nThe aid of a good telescope is, however, necessary to enable us to\r\nperceive the varied colours and tints of the sparkling gems with which\r\nNature has adorned her star-built edifice of the universe. Most of the\r\nprecious stones on Earth have their counterparts in the heavens,\r\npresenting in a jewelled form contrasts of colour, pleasing harmonies,\r\nand endless variety of shade. The diamond, sapphire, emerald, amethyst,\r\ntopaz, and ruby sparkle among crowds of stars of more sombre hue. Agate,\r\nchalcedony, onyx, opal, beryl, lapis-lazuli, and aquamarine are\r\nrepresented by the radiant sheen emanating from distant suns, displaying\r\nan inexhaustible variety of colour, blended in tints of untold harmony.\r\n\r\nIt is among double stars that the richest and most varied colours\r\npredominate. There are pairs of white, yellow, orange, and red stars;\r\nyellow and blue, yellow and pale emerald, yellow and rose red, yellow\r\nand fawn, green and gold, azure and crimson, golden and azure, orange\r\nand emerald, orange and lilac, orange and purple, orange and green,\r\nwhite and blue, white and lilac, lilac and dark purple, &c., &c. There\r\nare companion stars revolving round their primaries, coloured olive,\r\nlilac, russet, fawn, dun, buff, grey, and other shades indistinguishable\r\nby any name.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of binary star systems brings us to what may be regarded\r\nas the threshold of the fabric of the heavens. For it is known that\r\nother systems exist into the construction of which numerous stars enter.\r\nThese form intricate and complex stellar arrangements, in which the\r\ncomponent stars are physically united and retained in their orbits by\r\ntheir mutual attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE STARRY HEAVENS\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIPLE, QUADRUPLE, AND MULTIPLE STARS.--These, when observed with the\r\nnaked eye, appear as single stars, but, when examined with a high\r\nmagnifying power, each lucid point can be resolved into several\r\ncomponent stars. They vary in number from three to half a dozen or more,\r\nand form systems of a more complex character than what are observed in\r\nthe case of binary stars. In the usual construction of a triple system,\r\nthe secondary star of a binary is resolvable into two, each star being\r\nin mutual revolution, whilst they both gravitate round their primary. By\r\nanother arrangement, a close pair control the movements of a distant\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of triple stars is the tricoloured Gamma\r\nAndromedae. The brilliant components of this system have their\r\ncounterparts in the topaz, the emerald, and the sapphire--the larger\r\nstar is of the third magnitude and of a golden yellow colour; the\r\nsecondary of the fifth magnitude and of an emerald green. These stars\r\nare ten seconds apart, and, though they have been under observation\r\nsince 1777, no orbital movement has as yet been detected, but their\r\ncommon proper motion indicates their close relationship and physical\r\nconnection. In 1842, Otto Struve discovered that the companion star is\r\nitself double, and round it there gravitates a sapphire sun, which is\r\nbelieved to accomplish a revolution of its orbit in about 500 years. If\r\nround those suns there should be circling planetary systems of worlds\r\ninhabited by intelligent beings, the varied effects produced by the\r\nlight emanating from those different coloured orbs would be of a very\r\nbeautiful and pleasing nature.\r\n\r\nA system suggestive of the endless variety of stellar arrangement that\r\nexists throughout the sidereal regions is apparent in the case of the\r\ntriple star Zeta Cancri. Two of the stars, of magnitudes six and seven,\r\nform a binary in rapid revolution, the components of which complete a\r\ncircuit of their orbits in fifty-eight years, whilst the more distant\r\nthird star, of almost similar magnitude, accomplishes a wide orbital\r\nellipse round the other two in 500 or 600 years. These stars have been\r\nclosely observed by astronomers during the past forty years, with the\r\nresult that their motions have appeared most perplexing, and complicated\r\nbeyond precedent. 'If this be really a ternary system,' wrote Sir John\r\nHerschel, 'connected by the mutual attraction of its parts, its\r\nperturbations will present one of the most intricate problems in\r\nphysical astronomy.' The second star revolves round its primary, whilst\r\nthe third pursues a retrograde course, but its path, instead of being\r\neven, presents the appearance of a series of circular loopings, in\r\ntraversing which the star alternately quickens and slackens its pace,\r\nor at times appears to be stationary.\r\n\r\nAstronomers have arrived at the conclusion that these perturbations are\r\nproduced by the presence of a fourth member, which, though invisible, is\r\nprobably the most massive of the system--perhaps a magnificent world\r\nteeming with animated beings, and attended by three suns which gravitate\r\nround it, dispensing light and heat to meet the requirements of the\r\nvarious forms of life which exist on its surface. In this system we have\r\nan arrangement the reverse of what exists in the solar system, where all\r\nthe planets revolve round a predominant sun; but here there is a strange\r\nverification of the old Ptolemaic belief with regard to the path of a\r\nsun, though in this instance there are three suns circling round a dark\r\nglobe which they illumine and vivify.\r\n\r\nTriple stars occur with comparative frequency throughout the heavens. In\r\nMonoceros there is a fine triple star, discovered by Herschel, which he\r\ndescribes as 'one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens.' The\r\nstars Xi and Beta Scorpii form triple systems in which the components\r\nare differently arranged. In Xi the primary and secondary consist of two\r\nrevolving stars which control the movements of a distant attendant; in\r\nBeta the primary and secondary stars are in mutual revolution, whilst\r\nround the former there circles a very close minute companion. There are\r\ndoubtless many binary stars which, if examined with adequate telescopic\r\npower, would resolve themselves into triple and multiple systems, but\r\nthe profound distances of those objects render the detection of their\r\ncomponents a most difficult task.\r\n\r\nQuadruple stars are usually arranged in pairs, _i.e._ the primary and\r\nsecondary of a binary system are each resolvable into two, forming two\r\npairs, each pair being in mutual revolution, while they both gravitate\r\nround their common centre of gravity. Epsilon Lyrae, which has been\r\ndescribed as a double double, is an example of a quadruple system, and\r\nNu Scorpii is of a similar construction, but more beautiful because its\r\ncomponents are in closer proximity to each other. Close upon twenty of\r\nthose double double systems have been discovered in different parts of\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of quadruple systems is Theta Orionis, which\r\nis situated in the Great Nebula, by which it is surrounded. This star,\r\nwhen observed with a telescope of low power, can be at once resolved\r\ninto four separate lucent points, so arranged as to form a quadrilateral\r\nfigure or trapezium. They are of the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth\r\nmagnitudes, and described as pale white, garnet, faint lilac, and red.\r\nThough they have been under careful observation for upwards of two\r\ncenturies, no perceptible motion has been perceived as occurring among\r\nthem, nor has there been any change in their relative positions--they\r\nappear to be perfectly motionless; but we must not infer from this that\r\nno physical bond of union exists between them, for they are situated at\r\nan amazing distance from the Earth. Ascending higher in the scale of\r\ncelestial architecture, we have multiple stars forming systems still\r\nmore elaborate and complex, into the structure of which numerous stars\r\nenter, and they, as they increase in number, gradually merge into\r\nstar-clusters.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that around each of the components of a multiple star there\r\ncircles a retinue of planetary worlds, we are confronted with a most\r\nperplexing problem as to how the dynamical stability of a system so\r\ndifferent from, and so vastly more complicated than, that of our solar\r\nsystem is maintained--where, as it were, suns and planets\r\nintermingle--how numerous circling orbs can accomplish their revolutions\r\nwithout being swayed and deflected from their paths by the gravitational\r\nattraction of adjacent members of the same system. Perplexing though the\r\narrangement of such a scheme may be to our conception, yet, each orb has\r\nbeen weighed, poised, and adjusted by Infinite Wisdom, to perform its\r\nintricate motions in synchronous harmony with other members of the\r\nsystem--all moving in unison like the parts of a complicated piece of\r\nmechanism, and maintained in stable equilibrium by their mutual\r\nattraction--\r\n\r\n    Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere\r\n    Of planets and of fixed in all her wheels\r\n    Resembles nearest; mazes intricate,\r\n    Eccentric, intervolved, yet regular\r\n    Then most, when most irregular they seem;\r\n    And in their motions harmony divine\r\n    So smooths her charming tones that God's own ear\r\n    Listens delighted.--v. 620-27.\r\n\r\nAll the natural phenomena with which we are familiar would, in the case\r\nof planets revolving round the component suns of a multiple system, be\r\nof a different kind or altogether absent. Instead of being illumined by\r\none sun, those worlds would, at certain times, have several suns--some\r\nmore distant than others--above their horizons, and upon very rare\r\noccasions, if ever, would there be an entire absence of all of those\r\norbs from their skies. Consequently there would be no year such as we\r\nare familiar with; no regular sequence of seasons similar to what is\r\nexperienced on Earth; no alternation of day and night, for there would\r\nbe '_no night there_,' though, in the absence of the primary orb, the\r\nlight emitted by distant suns, whilst sufficient to banish night, and\r\nbeyond comparison brighter than the Moon when at full, would, in the\r\ndiminution of its intensity from that of noonday, be as grateful a\r\nchange as that of from day to night which occurs on our globe.\r\n\r\nShould those suns be differently coloured, each emitting its own\r\npeculiar shade of light as it appears above the horizon, the varied\r\naspects of the perpetual day enjoyed by the inhabitants of those\r\ncircling worlds present to the imagination harmonies of light and shade\r\nover which it is pleasant to linger.\r\n\r\nTEMPORARY, PERIODICAL, AND VARIABLE STARS.--It may seem remarkable that\r\namong so many thousands of stars which spangle the firmament, there\r\nshould occur no very perceptible change or variation in their aspect\r\nand brilliancy. From age to age they present the same appearance, shine\r\nwith the same undiminished splendour, and rise and set with the same\r\nregularity. So that from time immemorial the stars have been regarded by\r\nmankind as the embodiment of all that is eternal and unchangeable. Yet,\r\nthe serenity of the celestial regions does not always remain\r\nundisturbed--at occasional times a 'Nova,' or new star, blazes forth\r\nunexpectedly in the heavens, and perplexes astronomers; and, after\r\nshining with a varying degree of brilliancy for a few weeks or months,\r\ngradually diminishes in size and brightness and eventually becomes lost\r\nto sight.\r\n\r\nA record has been kept of about twenty temporary stars that have been\r\nobserved at various periods since the time that reliable data of those\r\nobjects have been published. Pliny mentions the appearance of a new star\r\nin the time of Hipparchus (134 B.C.); it was seen in the constellation\r\nof the Scorpion, and it is said that it was the apparition of this star\r\nwhich induced the celebrated astronomer to construct what is known as\r\nthe earliest star catalogue. A new star is said to have become visible\r\nwhen the Emperor Honorius ruled, and another during the reign of the\r\nEmperor Otho, about 945 A.D. In May 1012 a new star appeared in Aries,\r\nand in July 1203 another was observed in Scorpio, which resembled\r\nSaturn. The most remarkable star of this kind was one observed by Tycho\r\nBrahe, which appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia. He first\r\nperceived it on November 11, 1572. In lustre it equalled Jupiter, and\r\nwhen at its brightest rivalled Venus; it was visible at noonday, and at\r\nnight its light could be perceived through strata of cloud which\r\nrendered all other stars invisible. The star maintained its brilliancy\r\nfor three weeks, when it became of a yellowish colour and perceptibly\r\ndecreased in size; it afterwards assumed a ruddy hue resembling\r\nAldebaran, and, diminishing gradually in magnitude and brightness,\r\nceased to be visible in March 1574. It twinkled more than the other\r\nstars, and during the time it could be perceived its position remained\r\nunchanged. In 1604 a conspicuous new star burst forth in Ophiuchus. It\r\nsurpassed in brilliancy stars of the first magnitude, and outshone the\r\nplanet Jupiter, which was in its proximity. Kepler observed this star,\r\nand described it as 'sparkling like a diamond with prismatic tints.' It\r\nsoon began to decline after its appearance; in March 1605 it had shrunk\r\nto the dimensions of a third-magnitude star, and in a year later it\r\nbecame entirely lost to view. Other stars of the same class, though of a\r\nless conspicuous character, have been observed at occasional times.\r\nAnthelme, a Carthusian monk, discovered one near Beta Cygni in 1670;\r\nanother appeared in Ophiuchus in 1848; one in Scorpio in 1860; one in\r\nCorona Borealis in 1866; in Cygnus in 1876; in Andromeda in 1885; and in\r\nAuriga in 1892.\r\n\r\nVarious theories have been advanced in order to account for the sudden\r\noutbursts of those stars, the light from which has probably occupied\r\nnot much less than one hundred years in its passage hither. It has been\r\nsuggested that the collision of two suns, or of two great masses of\r\nmatter, would create such phenomena; but, apart from the improbability\r\nof such a catastrophe occurring among the celestial orbs, the rapid\r\nsubsidence in the luminosity of the observed objects would indicate that\r\nthe outburst was produced by causes of a more rapidly transitory nature\r\nthan what would result from the collision of two condensed masses of\r\nmatter. A collision occurring between two swarms of meteors has been\r\nsuggested as one way of accounting for the sudden appearance of those\r\nstars; but another, and more plausible, explanation is that they are\r\nproduced by a great eruption of glowing gas from the interior of a sun,\r\ncausing an enormous increase in its luminosity, which subsides after a\r\ntime, and is succeeded by a normal condition of things. It has been\r\nobserved that all those temporary stars, with the exception of two, have\r\nappeared in the region of the Milky Way. In this luminous zone the\r\ncondensation of small gaseous stars and nebulae is more pronounced than\r\nin any other part of the heavens, and this would seem to indicate that\r\nthere may be cosmical changes taking place among them which need not be\r\nassociated with the occurrence of catastrophes resulting in the\r\nconflagration of worlds, and that Nature, in accomplishing her purposes,\r\ndoes not overstep the uniform working of her laws, upon which depend the\r\nstability and existence of the universe.\r\n\r\nPERIODICAL AND VARIABLE STARS are distinguished from other similar\r\nobjects by the fluctuations which occur in the quantity of light emitted\r\nby them. The difference in the luminosity of some stars is at times so\r\nmarked that, in a few weeks or months, they decline from the first or\r\nsecond magnitudes to invisibility, and, after the expiration of a\r\ncertain period, they again gradually regain their pristine condition.\r\nWhen these changes take place with regular recurrence, they are called\r\n'periodical;' when they occur in a variable and uncertain manner, they\r\nare called 'irregular.' About 300 stars are known as variable, but the\r\nmajority of them are telescopic objects. Their periodical changes of\r\nbrilliancy present every degree of variety; in some stars they are\r\nscarcely perceptible and occur at long intervals; in others, changes of\r\nbrightness occur in a few hours or days, by which the light emitted is\r\nintensified many hundreds of times.\r\n\r\nSome stars accomplish their cycle of change in a few days, many in a few\r\nweeks or months, and there are others which do not complete their\r\nperiods until the expiration of a number of years.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable of variable stars is called Mira 'the\r\nwonderful,' in the constellation Cetus. When at its maximum brilliancy\r\nit shines for two or three weeks as a star of the second magnitude. It\r\nthen begins to gradually decline, and at the end of three months becomes\r\ninvisible. It remains invisible for five months, and then reappears, and\r\nduring the ensuing three months it regains by degrees its former\r\nbrilliancy. Mira completes a cycle of its changes in 334 days, and,\r\nduring that time, oscillates between a star of the second and tenth\r\nmagnitude. The variability of Mira Ceti was first observed by David\r\nFabricius in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable star is Eta Argus, which is surrounded by the great\r\nnebula in the constellation Argo Navis. It is invisible to the naked\r\neye, but in the telescope it has a reddish appearance, and is slightly\r\nbrighter than the stars in its vicinity. It was first observed by Halley\r\nin 1677, and it was then of the fourth magnitude. In 1751 it had risen\r\nto the second magnitude, and maintained its position as a star of this\r\nclass until 1837, when, on December 16 of that year, its brilliancy\r\nsuddenly increased, and it equalled in a short time Alpha Centauri. It\r\nreached its maximum in 1843, and then it was surpassed only by Sirius.\r\nIt maintained its brilliancy for about ten years. In 1858, it declined\r\nto the second magnitude, in 1859 to the third, and, gradually\r\ndiminishing, it became invisible to the naked eye in 1868. It is now of\r\nthe seventh magnitude, and is again increasing, and may soon resume its\r\nposition among the other stars. It is believed to have a period of\r\nseventy years, and in that time its light ebbs and flows between the\r\nseventh and first magnitudes.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting variable star in the heavens is Algol (the demon),\r\nin the constellation Perseus. Its light fluctuations can be observed\r\nwithout the aid of a telescope, and it completes a cycle of its changes\r\nin two or three days. For about two days and thirteen hours it is\r\nconspicuously visible as a star of the second magnitude; it then begins\r\nto decline, and in about four hours sinks to the dimensions of a\r\nfourth-magnitude star; it remains in this condition for twenty minutes,\r\nand then increases gradually until, at the expiration of four hours, it\r\nregains its former brilliancy, which it sustains for two days and\r\nthirteen hours, when it again goes through the same cycle of changes in\r\na precisely similar manner to what has been described. Astrologers have\r\nascribed many evil influences to the demon star, which adorned the head\r\nof Medusa; nor did it escape the observation of ancient astronomers that\r\nthis malevolent orb is--as a modern writer amusingly remarks--slowly\r\nwinking at us from out the depths of space.\r\n\r\nVariable stars are found in greater numbers in some parts of the heavens\r\nthan in others. Those of a white colour, and with shorter and more\r\nregular periods, are most numerous in the region of the Milky Way; those\r\nthat are small, with long periods and of a reddish hue, are more widely\r\nremoved from that zone. Stars of this class are all very remote, and no\r\nattempt has as yet been made to ascertain the parallax of Algol.\r\n\r\nSeveral theories have been suggested in order to account for the\r\nperiodical brilliancy of those stars. It has been suggested that the\r\nstars have opaque non-luminous patches on their surfaces, and that\r\nduring axial rotation their light ebbs and flows according as the dark\r\nor bright portions are turned towards us. This theory is highly\r\nimprobable. Another and more plausible reason, especially with regard to\r\nshort period variables, is, that around those stars there revolve opaque\r\nbodies or satellites which at times intercept a portion of their light\r\nby producing a partial eclipse of their discs, similar to that caused by\r\nthe dark body of the Moon when passing between the Sun and the Earth.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that in the case of variables of the Algol type, the\r\nperiodical fluctuations of their light arises from this cause, and that\r\nround Algol there is a dark world or satellite travelling, which\r\ncompletes a revolution of its orbit in about sixty-nine hours, and that,\r\nduring each circuit, it intercepts one half of the light of its primary\r\nby partially eclipsing the orb, and thereby creating a diminution in its\r\napparent magnitude which becomes perceptible at recurring intervals.\r\n\r\nSTAR GROUPS.--These are plentifully scattered over the heavens and, by\r\ntheir conspicuous brilliancy, add to the grandeur and magnificence of\r\nthe midnight sky. The Hyades in Taurus, of which Aldebaran is the chief,\r\nforming the eye of the Bull, attract attention.\r\n\r\nThe stars in Coma Bernices form a rich group; the sickle in Leo, the\r\nseven stars in Ursa Major, and those in Cassiopeia and Aquila are\r\nfamiliarly known to all observers. Besides these, there are many other\r\ngroups and aggregations of stars which adorn the celestial vault and\r\nenhance the beauty of the heavens.\r\n\r\nSTAR CLUSTERS.--On observing the heavens on a clear, dark night, there\r\ncan be seen in different parts of the sky closely aggregated groups of\r\nstars called clusters. In some instances the component stars are so near\r\ntogether that the naked eye is unable to discern the individual members\r\nof the cluster. They then assume an indistinct, hazy, cloudlike\r\nappearance. Upwards of 500 clusters are known to astronomers, the\r\nmajority of which are very remote. Many of them contain thousands of\r\nstars compressed into a very small space, and others are so distant that\r\nthe largest telescopes are incapable of resolving their nebulous\r\nappearance into separate stars.\r\n\r\nStar clusters have been arranged into two classes, 'irregular' and\r\n'globular;' but no sharp line of demarcation exists between them, though\r\neach have their distinctive peculiarities. Irregular clusters consist of\r\naggregations of stars brought promiscuously together, and presenting an\r\nappearance devoid of any structural arrangement. They are of different\r\nshapes and sizes, possess no distinct outline, and are not condensed\r\ntowards their centre, like those that are globular. On examination, they\r\npresent an intricate reticulated appearance; streams and branches of\r\nstars extend outwards from the parent cluster, sometimes in rows and\r\nsinuous lines, and, in other instances, diverging from a common centre,\r\nforming sprays. Sometimes the stars are seen to follow each other on the\r\nsame curve which terminates in loops and arches of symmetrical\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThere are three conspicuous clusters in the northern sky that are\r\nvisible to the naked eye--viz. the Pleiades in Taurus, the Great Cluster\r\nin the sword-handle of Perseus, and Praesepe in Cancer, commonly called\r\nthe Beehive.\r\n\r\nThe cluster which from time immemorial has had bestowed upon it the\r\nchief attention of mankind are the beautiful Pleiades or Seven Sisters,\r\nand intertwined among its stars are the legendary and mythological\r\nbeliefs of ancient nations and untutored tribes inhabiting the different\r\nregions of the globe. When viewed with a telescope of moderate size the\r\ncluster appears as a scattered group, and numerous stars become visible\r\nthat are imperceptible to ordinary vision.\r\n\r\nIn the sword-handle of Perseus there is a cluster which, to the naked\r\neye, appears as a small patch of luminous cloud. This inconspicuous\r\nobject when observed with an instrument of moderate power is resolved\r\ninto a magnificent assemblage of stars, and presents a spectacle which\r\ncreates in the mind of the beholder mingled feelings of admiration and\r\namazement. No telescope has yet penetrated its utmost depths, or\r\nrevealed all the glories of this shining region, crowded with glittering\r\npoints of light comparable in number to the pebbles strewn on the shore\r\nof a troubled sea.\r\n\r\nThe cluster Praesepe in Cancer is visible on a clear night to the\r\nunaided eye as a small nebula. This object attracted the attention of\r\nGalileo, to which he applied his newly invented telescope, and was\r\ndelighted to find that his glass was capable of resolving it into a\r\ngroup of stars thirty-six in number, and all of comparatively large\r\nmagnitude. The disappearance of Praesepe in consequence of the\r\ncondensation of vapour in the atmosphere was regarded by the ancients as\r\na sure indication of approaching rain. In the same constellation, near\r\nthe Crab's southern claw, there is another rich cluster, which consists\r\nof 200 stars of the ninth and tenth magnitudes.\r\n\r\nIn Sobieski's Shield there is a magnificent fan-shaped cluster of minute\r\nstars with a prominent one in its centre; and in the constellation of\r\nthe Southern Cross there is a cluster which, on account of the varied\r\ncolours of its component stars, has been compared by Sir John Herschel\r\nto 'a piece of rich fancy jewellery;' eight of the principal stars being\r\ncoloured red, green, and blue.\r\n\r\nGLOBULAR CLUSTERS.--These have been described by Herschel as 'the most\r\nmagnificent objects that can be seen in the heavens.' They are all very\r\nremote, of a rounded form, and when viewed with a telescope present the\r\nappearance of 'a ball of stars.' In some clusters the constituent stars\r\nare distinguishable as minute points of light; in others, more remote,\r\nthey are of a coarse granular texture, and in those still more distant\r\nthey resemble a 'heap of golden sand.' Some clusters are situated at\r\nsuch a profound distance in space that it is impossible with the most\r\npowerful of telescopes to define their stellar structure; all that can\r\nbe distinguished of these is a cloudy luminosity resembling in\r\nappearance an irresolvable nebula. Globular clusters usually present a\r\nradiated appearance. Rays, branches, and spiral-shaped streams of stars\r\nappear to flow from the circumference of some; and, in other instances,\r\nfantastic appendages of stars project outwards from the parent cluster.\r\nThere doubtless exists much variety in the structural arrangement of\r\nthese clusters, and an equal diversity in the magnitude and number of\r\nthe stars which enter into their formation. The stars in some clusters\r\nmay equal those of the first magnitude, and in others they may not\r\nexceed in dimensions the minor planets. In the telescope they vary in\r\nsize from the eleventh to the fifteenth magnitude; the smaller stars\r\noccupy the centre of a cluster, whilst the larger ones are found near\r\nits circumference. Globular clusters are more condensed towards their\r\ncentre than those of irregular shape, and some have a nucleated\r\nappearance. This apparent condensation is not altogether owing to the\r\ndepth of star strata as viewed from the circumference of the cluster,\r\nbut there appears to exist an attractive force (probably gravitational)\r\nwhich draws the stars towards its centre, and if this 'clustering power'\r\nwere not opposed by some other counteracting force, those bodies would\r\ncoalesce into one mass. It may be 'that a centrifugal impulse\r\npredominates by which full-grown orbs are driven from the nursery of\r\nsuns in which they were reared to seek their separate fortunes and enter\r\non an independent career elsewhere.'\r\n\r\nIt is not known how the dynamical equilibrium of a star cluster is\r\nmaintained; and on account of its extreme distance no motion is\r\nperceptible among its component stars. The laws by which those stellar\r\naggregations are produced and governed are wrapped in obscurity, and the\r\nnature of the motions of their stars, whether towards concentration or\r\ndiffusion, cannot at present be ascertained. If those globular clusters\r\ncould be observed sufficiently near, they would most probably expand\r\ninto vast systems of suns occupying immense regions of space.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most magnificent globular cluster in the heavens is\r\nOmega Centauri, in the Southern Hemisphere. To the naked eye it\r\nresembles a round, indistinct, cometary object, about equal to a star of\r\nthe fourth magnitude; but when observed with a powerful telescope it\r\nappears as a globe of considerable dimensions composed of innumerable\r\nstars of the thirteenth and fifteenth magnitudes, all exceedingly minute\r\nand gathered into small knots and groups. A remarkable cluster in\r\nToucani is described by Sir John Herschel as 'most magnificent; very\r\nlarge; very bright, and very much compressed in the middle.' The\r\ninterior mass consists of closely aggregated pale rose-coloured stars,\r\nsurrounded by others of a pure white which embrace the remainder of the\r\ncluster. There is a fine globular cluster in Sagittarius between the\r\nArcher's head and the bow. It was observed by Hevelius in 1665. The\r\ncentral portion is very much compressed, and consists of excessively\r\nminute stars enclosed by others of larger size. In Aquarius there is a\r\nmagnificent ball of stars of a beautiful spherical form, which Sir J.\r\nHerschel compared to a heap of fine sand. Numerous other clusters are\r\nprofusely distributed over the heavens, occupying regions in the\r\nprofound depths of space which can only be reached by the aid of most\r\npowerful instruments.\r\n\r\nThe finest and most remarkable object of this class visible in the\r\nnorthern heavens is the Great Cluster which lies between Eta and Zeta\r\nHerculis. It was discovered by Halley in 1714, who writes: 'This is but\r\na little patch, but it shows itself to the naked eye when the sky is\r\nserene and the moon absent.' When observed with a powerful telescope its\r\nmagnificence at once becomes apparent to the beholder. 'Perhaps,' says\r\nDr. Nichol, 'no one ever saw it for the first time through a telescope\r\nwithout uttering a shout of wonder.' At its circumference the stars are\r\nrather scattered, but towards the centre they appear so closely\r\naggregated that their combined effulgence forms a perfect blaze of\r\nlight. Sir William Herschel estimated that there are 14,000 stars in the\r\ncluster, each a magnificent world but unaccompanied by any planetary\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLUSTER IN HERCULES]\r\n\r\nAs a result of more recent investigations this number has been\r\nconsiderably reduced, and it is now generally believed that about 4,000\r\nstars enter into the formation of the cluster. As its distance from the\r\nEarth is unknown, it follows that there must be some uncertainty\r\nattached to any conclusions that may be arrived at with regard to this\r\nsuperb object. Miss Agnes Clerke estimates the number of the constituent\r\nstars at 4,000, and in support of her conclusion this talented lady\r\nwrites as follows: 'The apparent diameter of this object, including most\r\nof the \"scattered stars in streaky masses and lines\" which form a sort\r\nof \"glory\" round it, is 8'; that of its truly spherical portion may be\r\nput at 5'. Now, a globe subtending an angle of 5' must have (because the\r\nsine of that angle is to radius nearly as to 1 : 687) a real diameter\r\n1/687 of its distance from the eye, which, if we assume to be such as\r\nwould correspond to a parallax of 1/20 of a second, we find that the\r\ncluster, outliers apart, measures 558,000 millions of miles across.\r\nLight, in other words, occupies thirty-six days in traversing it, but\r\nsixty-five years in journeying thence hither. Its components may be\r\nregarded, on an average, as of the twelfth magnitude; for, although the\r\ndivergent stars rank much higher in the scale of brightness, the central\r\nones, there is reason to believe, are notably fainter. The sum total of\r\ntheir light, if concentrated into one stellar point, would at any rate\r\nvery little (if at all) exceed that of a third-magnitude star. And one\r\nstar of the third is equivalent to just four thousand stars of the\r\ntwelfth magnitude. Hence we arrive at the conclusion that the stars in\r\nthe Hercules Cluster number much more nearly four than fourteen\r\nthousand.'\r\n\r\nFor what purpose do those thousands of clustering orbs shine? Who can\r\ntell? Night is unknown in the regions illumined by their brilliant\r\nradiance. This stupendous aggregation of suns testifies to the\r\nmagnificence of the starry heavens, and to the omnipotence of the\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nGALAXIES.--These consist of vast aggregations of stars which form\r\nseparate 'island universes' floating in the depths of space; they are\r\nbelieved to equal in magnitude and magnificence the Milky Way--the\r\ngalaxy to which our system belongs.\r\n\r\nNEBULAE.--We now reach the last, and what are believed to be the most\r\ndistant of the known contents of the heavens. They are all exceedingly\r\nremote, devoid of any perceptible motion, faintly luminous, and, with\r\nthe exception of two of their number, invisible to the naked eye. Halley\r\nwas the first astronomer who paid any attention to those objects. In\r\n1716 he enumerated six of them, but of this number only two can, in a\r\nstrict sense, be regarded as nebulae, the others since then have been\r\nresolved into magnificent star clusters. In 1784, Messier catalogued 103\r\nnebulae, and the Herschels--father and son--in their survey of the\r\nstellar regions, discovered 4,000 of those objects. There are now 8,000\r\nknown nebulae in the heavens, but the majority of them are not of much\r\ninterest to astronomers. Prior to the invention of the spectroscope it\r\nwas believed that all nebulae were irresolvable star clusters, but the\r\nanalysis of their light by this instrument indicated that their\r\ncomposition was not stellar but gaseous. Their spectra consist of a few\r\nbright lines revealing the presence of hydrogen, nitrogen, and other\r\ngaseous elements.\r\n\r\nMuch that is mysterious and uncertain is associated with those objects\r\nwhich appear to lie far beyond the limits of our sidereal system. It is\r\nnow generally believed that they exhibit the earliest stage in the\r\nformation of stars and planets--inchoate worlds in process of slow\r\nevolution, which will eventually condense into systems of suns, and\r\nplanetary worlds.\r\n\r\nNebulae present every variety of form. Some are annular, elliptic,\r\ncircular, and spiral; others are fan-shaped, cylindrical, and irregular,\r\nwith tufted appendages, rays, and filaments. A fancied resemblance to\r\ndifferent animated creatures has been observed in some. In Taurus there\r\nis a nebula called the 'Crab' on account of its likeness to the\r\ncrustacean; another is called the 'Owl Nebula' from its resemblance to\r\nthe face of that bird. The Orion Nebula suggests the opened jaws of a\r\nfish or sea monster, hence called the Fish-Mouth Nebula. There is a\r\nHorse-Shoe Nebula, a Dumb-Bell Nebula, and many others of various shapes\r\nand forms. They are classified as follows: (1) Annular Nebulae, (2)\r\nElliptic Nebulae, (3) Spiral Nebulae, (4) Planetary Nebulae, (5) Nebulous\r\nStars, (6) Large Irregular Nebulae.\r\n\r\nANNULAR NEBULAE.--These resemble in appearance an oval-shaped luminous\r\nring; they are comparatively few in number, and not more than a dozen\r\nhave been discovered in the whole heavens. The most remarkable object of\r\nthis class is the Ring Nebula, which is situated between the stars Beta\r\nand Gamma Lyrae. It is visible in a moderate-sized telescope as a\r\nwell-defined, flat, oval ring; its central part is not quite dark but is\r\noccupied by a filmy haze of luminous matter which is prolonged inwards\r\nfrom the margin of the ring. When examined with a high power the edges\r\nof the ring have a fringed appearance, and numerous glittering stellar\r\npoints become visible both within and without its circumference. This\r\nnebulous ring, though a small object in the telescope, is of enormous\r\nmagnitude, and if it were not more distant than 61 Cygni, one of the\r\nnearest of the fixed stars, its diameter would not be less than 20,000\r\nmillions of miles, but it has been estimated by Herschel that it is 900\r\ntimes more remote than Sirius. How stupendous, then, must be its\r\ndimensions, and how bewildering to our conception is the profound\r\nimmensity of space in which it is located! An annular nebula similar to\r\nthat of Lyra, but on a smaller scale, is found in Cygnus, and within it\r\nthere can be seen a conspicuous star. Another exists in Scorpio which\r\ncontains two stars situated within the ring at diametrically opposite\r\npoints to each other.\r\n\r\nELLIPTICAL NEBULAE.--The most interesting object of this class is the\r\nGreat Nebula in Andromeda, called 'the transcendentally beautiful queen\r\nof the nebulae'--an appellation which it scarcely merits. This object,\r\nwhich is plainly visible to the naked eye, is of an oval shape, of a\r\nmilky white colour, and is situated near the most northern star of the\r\nthree which form the girdle of Andromeda. It was known to the ancients,\r\nand Ali Sufi, a Persian astronomer who flourished in the tenth century,\r\nalludes to it; but it did not attract much attention until the\r\nseventeenth century. Simon Marius was the first to observe this object\r\nwith a telescope. This he did on December 15, 1612; he describes it as\r\nshining with a pale white light resembling in appearance the flame of a\r\ncandle when seen through a semi-transparent piece of horn. When examined\r\nwith a high magnifying power it is seen to occupy a largely extended\r\narea measuring 4 deg. in length and 2-1/2 deg. in breadth. Its luminosity\r\nincreases from the circumference to the centre, where there can be seen\r\na small nucleus with an ill-defined boundary, which has the appearance\r\nof being granular, but its composition is not stellar. Two dark channels\r\nrunning almost parallel to each other and to the axis of the nebula have\r\nbeen observed by Bond; these, when prolonged, form into curves which\r\nterminate in two great rings. They are wide rifts which separate streams\r\nof nebulous matter, and are indicative that some formative processes may\r\nbe going on within the nebula.\r\n\r\nAstronomers have been baffled in their attempts to discover the nature\r\nof the Andromeda Nebula. Though great telescopes have been able to\r\nrender visible thousands of stars over and around it, yet the nebula\r\nitself is irresolvable and bears no trace of stellar formation;\r\nneither, according to Dr. Huggins, is its spectrum gaseous, a\r\ncircumstance which deepens the mystery associated with this object. Its\r\ndistance is unknown, and its dimensions cannot be ascertained.\r\n\r\nOther elliptical nebulae are found in different regions of the heavens.\r\nIn Ursa Major there is an oval nebula resembling that of Andromeda, but\r\non a much smaller scale. It possesses a nucleus, and on the photographic\r\nplate there can be detected the presence of spiral structure, indicating\r\nthe existence of streams of nebulous matter. Adjacent to this nebula is\r\nanother of the same class with a double nucleus, and associated with it\r\nis a nebulous star.\r\n\r\nSPIRAL NEBULAE.--The great reflector of Earl Rosse at Parsonstown was the\r\nsuccessful means by which nebulae of this form were discovered. This\r\npowerful telescope was capable of defining with greater accuracy the\r\nstructural formation of those objects than any other instrument in use.\r\nIt was ascertained that spiral coils and convoluted whorls enter into\r\nthe structure of most nebulae, indicating a similarity in the process of\r\nchange which may be going on in these vast accumulations of cosmical\r\nmatter. The most interesting specimen of a spiral nebula is situated in\r\nCanes Venatici. It consists of spiral coils emanating from a centre with\r\na nucleus and surrounded by a narrow luminous ring. In appearance it\r\nresembles the coiled mainspring of a watch.\r\n\r\nPLANETARY NEBULAE.--These have been so named on account of the\r\nresemblance which they bear to the discs of planets. They are of uniform\r\nbrightness, circular in shape, with sharply-defined edges, and are\r\nfrequently of a bluish colour. They are more numerous than annular\r\nnebulae; three-fourths of their number are in the Southern Hemisphere,\r\nand they are situated in or very near the Milky Way. Those objects were\r\nfirst described by Sir William Herschel, who was rather perplexed as to\r\nwhat was their real nature and how he should classify them. He remarked\r\nthat they could not be planets belonging to far-off suns, nor distant\r\ncomets, nor distended stars. Consequently, he concluded rightly that\r\nthey were nebulae. When observed with large telescopes, they lose their\r\nplanetary aspect, and their sharpness of outline is less apparent; their\r\ndiscs become broken up into bright and dark portions, and in some,\r\nnumerous minute stars have been observed, whilst others have\r\nwell-defined nuclei.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent nebula of this class is situated in the constellation\r\nUrsa Major, and is called the Owl Nebula, from its fancied resemblance\r\nto the face of that bird. Sir John Herschel describes it as 'a most\r\nextraordinary object, a large, uniform nebulous disc, quite round, very\r\nbright, not sharply defined, but yet very suddenly fading away to\r\ndarkness.' When examined in 1848 with Earl Rosse's reflector, two bright\r\nstars were discovered in its interior; each was in the centre of a\r\ncircular dark space surrounded by whorls of nebulous matter--hence the\r\norigin of its name. This nebula gives a bright line spectrum indicative\r\nof gaseous composition. It is believed to consist chiefly of hydrogen\r\nand other gases which form a globe of such stupendous magnitude that, if\r\nwe surmise its distance from the earth to be sixty-five light years--an\r\nestimate much too low--'its diameter would exceed that of the orbit of\r\nNeptune upwards of 100 times.'[10] Within its compass the orbs of\r\nhundreds of solar systems as large as that of ours would be able to\r\nperform their revolutions, having spacious intervals existing between\r\neach system. Another interesting planetary nebula is in the\r\nconstellation of the Dragon, near to the pole of the ecliptic; it is\r\nslightly oval, of a pale blue colour, and contains a star of the\r\neleventh magnitude in its centre. It gives a gaseous spectrum. Attempts\r\nhave been made to determine its parallax, but without success, and\r\nduring the eighty years it has been under observation it has remained\r\napparently motionless. Its light period, if estimated at 140 years,\r\nwould indicate the existence of a globe with a diameter equal to\r\nforty-four diameters of the orbit of the planet Neptune.[11] A nebula of\r\nthis class was discovered by Sir John Herschel in the Centaur. He\r\ndescribed it as resembling Uranus, but larger; its colour was of a\r\nbeautiful rich blue, and its light equalled that of a star of the\r\nseventh magnitude.\r\n\r\nNEBULOUS STARS.--These stars are each surrounded by a luminous haze\r\nseveral minutes of arc in diameter and of a circular form. Sir William\r\nHerschel, by his observation of those objects, arrived at the conclusion\r\n'that there exists in space a shining fluid of a nature totally unknown\r\nto us, and that the nebulosity about those stars was not of a starry\r\nnature.' Thirteen stars of this type have been enumerated by him and\r\nmany others have since been discovered. The 'glow' which surrounds them\r\nhas been observed in a few instances to have vanished without leaving\r\nany trace of nebulosity behind, but the causes which have brought about\r\nsuch a result are entirely unknown. The nature of those stars is\r\ninvolved in considerable obscurity, and one class of nebula would seem\r\nto merge into the other; nebulous stars with faint aureolae do not differ\r\nmuch from small nebulae interspersed with stellar points.\r\n\r\nLARGE IRREGULAR NEBULAE.--These are found in both hemispheres, and are\r\nremarkable on account of the varied appearances which they present, and\r\nthe large extent of space which many of them occupy. In some, the\r\nnebulous matter of which they are composed can be seen like masses of\r\ntufted flocculi, sometimes piled up, and at other times promiscuously\r\nscattered, resembling in appearance the foam on the crested billows of a\r\nsurging ocean rendered suddenly motionless, or cirro-cumuli floating in\r\na tranquil sky. Islands of light with intervening dark channels,\r\npromontories projecting into gulfs of deep shade, sprays of luminous\r\nmatter, convoluted filaments, whorls, wreaths, and spiral streams all\r\nenter into the structural formation of a great nebula.\r\n\r\nThe Great Nebula in Argo, in the Southern Hemisphere, is one of the most\r\nremarkable objects of this class. It consists of bright irregular masses\r\nof luminous matter, streaks and branches, and occupies an area about\r\nequal to one square degree. At its eastern border is situated the\r\nvariable star Eta Argus, which fluctuates between the first and seventh\r\nmagnitudes in a period of about seventy years.\r\n\r\nA rich portion of the Galaxy lies in front of the nebula, which creates\r\nan effect as if it were studded over with stars. Sir John Herschel, in\r\ndescribing this nebula, writes as follows:--'The whole is situated in a\r\nvery rich and brilliant part of the Milky Way, so thickly strewed with\r\nstars that, in the area occupied by the nebula, not less than 1,200 have\r\nbeen actually counted. Yet it is obvious that these have no connection\r\nwhatever with the nebula, being, in fact, only a simple continuation\r\nover it of the general ground of the Galaxy. The conclusion can hardly\r\nbe avoided that, in looking at it, we see through and beyond the Milky\r\nWay, far out into space, through a starless region, disconnecting it\r\naltogether from our system. It is not easy for language to convey a full\r\nimpression of the beauty and sublimity of the spectacle which this\r\nnebula offers as it enters the field of view of a telescope, fixed in\r\nright ascension, by the diurnal motion, ushered in as it is by so\r\nglorious and innumerable a procession of stars, to which it forms a sort\r\nof climax, and in a part of the heavens otherwise full of interest.'\r\nAnother large bright nebula (called 30 Doradus), also in the Southern\r\nHemisphere, is composed of a series of loops with intricate windings\r\nforming a kind of open network against the background of the sky which\r\nit adorns. Sir John Herschel describes it as one of the most\r\nextraordinary objects in the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe 'Crab' Nebula in Taurus, the 'Horse-Shoe' Nebula in Sobieski's\r\nShield, and the 'Dumb-Bell' Nebula in Vulpecula are remarkable objects,\r\nbut the assistance of a powerful telescope is required to bring out\r\ntheir distinctive features. The 'Crab' Nebula is partially resolvable\r\ninto stars; the other two are believed to be gaseous.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most remarkable of all the nebulae is that known as the\r\nGreat Nebula in Orion, which was discovered and delineated by Huygens in\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century. It is perceptible to the naked\r\neye, and when viewed with a glass of low power can be seen as a circular\r\nluminous haze surrounding the multiple star Theta Orionis--one of the\r\nstars in the Giant's Sword, and which is of itself a remarkable object.\r\nThe most conspicuous part of the nebula bears a slight resemblance to\r\nthe wing of a bird; it consists of flocculent masses of nebulous matter\r\npossessing a faint greenish tinge. Sir John Herschel compared it to a\r\nsurface studded over with flocks of wool, or to the breaking up of a\r\nmackerel sky when the clouds of which it consists begin to assume a\r\ncirrous appearance. Its brightest portion is occupied by four\r\nconspicuous stars, which form a trapezium; around each there is a dark\r\nspace free from nebulosity, a circumstance which would seem to indicate\r\nthat the stars possess the power either of absorbing or of repelling the\r\nnebulous matter in their immediate vicinity. When observed with a\r\npowerful telescope, this nebula appears to be of vast dimensions, and,\r\nwith its effluents, occupies an area of 4 deg. by 5-1/2 deg.. Irregular\r\nbranching masses, streams, sprays, filaments, and curved spiral wreaths\r\nproject outward from the parent mass, and become gradually lost in the\r\nsurrounding space. This object remained for long a profound mystery; no\r\ntelescope was capable of resolving it, nor was it known what this\r\n'unformed fiery mist, the chaotic material of future suns,' was, until\r\nthe spectroscope revealed that it consists of a stupendous mass of\r\nincandescent gases--nitrogen, hydrogen, and other elementary substances,\r\noccupying a region of space believed by some to equal in extent the\r\nwhole stellar system to which our Sun belongs.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern Hemisphere, near to the pole of the equator, are two\r\nnebulous clouds of unequal size; the larger having an area about four\r\ntimes that of the smaller. They are known as the Magellanic Clouds,\r\nhaving been called after the navigator Magellan. Both are visible on a\r\nmoonless night, but in bright moonlight the smaller disappears. Sir John\r\nHerschel, when at the Cape of Good Hope, examined those objects with his\r\npowerful telescope. He described them 'as consisting of swarms of stars,\r\nglobular clusters, and nebulae of various kinds, some portions of them\r\nbeing quite irresolvable, and presenting the same milky appearance in\r\nthe telescope that the nebulae themselves do to the naked eye.' These are\r\nbelieved to be other universes of stars sunk in the profound depths of\r\nspace, our knowledge of their existence being dependent upon the faint\r\nnebulous light which left them, perhaps, several thousand years ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT NEBULA IN ORION]\r\n\r\nThe description of the various kinds of nebulae leads us to consider what\r\nis called the Nebular Hypothesis. That the stars and solar system had at\r\nsome time in the past a beginning, is as much a matter of certainty as\r\nthat they will at some future time cease to be. Stars, like organic\r\nbeings, have their birth, grow and arrive at maturity, then decline into\r\na state of decrepitude, and finally die out. The duration of the life of\r\na star, which may be reckoned by millions of years, depends upon the\r\nlength of time during which it can maintain a temperature that renders\r\nit capable of emitting light. By the constant radiation of its heat into\r\nspace, a condition of its constituent particles consequent upon the\r\ngradual contraction of its mass will ultimately occur, which will result\r\nin the exhaustion of its stores of thermal energy, the extinction of its\r\nlight, and the reduction of what was once a brilliant orb to the\r\ncondition of a mass of cold, opaque, inert matter. Inquiries as to the\r\norigin of the stars have led scientific men to conclude that they have\r\nbeen evolved from gaseous nebulae, and these have therefore been regarded\r\nas indicating the earliest stage in the formation of suns and planets.\r\nIt is believed that the condensation of those attenuated masses of\r\nluminous matter into stars is capable of accounting for the generation\r\nand formation of all the shining orbs which enter into the structure of\r\nthe starry heavens. In the evolution of a 'cosmos out of a chaos' we\r\nshould expect to find stars presenting every stage of development--some\r\nin an embryo state and others more advanced; stars in full vigour and\r\nactivity, stars that have passed the meridian of life, and stars in a\r\ncondition of decay and on the verge of extinction. The observations of\r\nastronomers have led them to conclude that this condition of 'youth and\r\nage' exists among the stellar multitude; but the characteristics by\r\nwhich it is distinguished are neither very obvious nor reliable.\r\n\r\nThe nebular theory is incapable of proof or demonstration; but modern\r\ndiscoveries tend to support the accuracy of its conclusions, and its\r\nprinciples have now been adopted by the majority of philosophic\r\nthinkers. The physical changes which are going on in the nebulae towards\r\nstellar evolution, or in fully formed stars towards dissolution, are so\r\nslow that the life of an individual, or even the historical records of\r\nthe past, are incapable of furnishing any evidence of alteration in\r\ntheir condition. A period of time infinitely greater than what has\r\nelapsed since the birth of science must pass before anything can be\r\nknown of the life history of the stars; indeed, the allotted span of\r\nman's existence on this planet may have terminated ere the evolution of\r\na large nebula into a star cluster can have taken place.\r\n\r\nThe nebular hypothesis was first propounded by Kant, who suggested that\r\nthe sun and planets originated from a vast and diffused mass of cosmical\r\nmatter. This theory was afterwards supported by Herschel and by the\r\ngreat French astronomer Laplace. As a result of close and continued\r\nobservation of the different classes of nebulae, Herschel arrived at the\r\nconclusion that there exists in space a widely diffused 'shining fluid,'\r\nof a nature totally unknown to us, and that the nebulosity which he\r\nperceived to surround some stars was not of a starry nature. He further\r\nadds that this self-luminous matter 'seemed more fit to produce a star\r\nby its condensation than to depend on the star for its existence.' His\r\nsagacious conclusion with regard to the non-stellar nature of this\r\nnebulous matter was afterwards confirmed by the spectroscope; for at\r\nthat time it was believed that even the faintest nebulae were\r\nirresolvable star clusters.\r\n\r\nIn 1811 Herschel read a paper before the Royal Society in which he\r\npropounded his famous nebular hypothesis, and stated his reasons for\r\nbelieving that nebulae, by their gradual condensation, were transformed\r\ninto stars. Having assumed that there exists a highly attenuated\r\nself-luminous substance diffused over vast regions of space, he\r\nendeavoured to show that by the law of attraction its particles would\r\nhave a tendency to coalesce and form aggregations of nebulous matter,\r\nand that each of these, by the continued action of the same force, would\r\ngradually condense and ultimately acquire the consistence of a star. In\r\nthe case of large irregular nebulae, numerous centres of attraction would\r\noriginate in the mass, round which the nebulous particles of matter\r\nwould arrange themselves; each nucleus, when condensation had been\r\ncompleted, would become a star, and the entire nebula would in this\r\nmanner be transformed into a cluster of stars. Herschel believed that he\r\ncould trace the different stages of nebular condensation which result in\r\nthe evolution of a star. In large, faintly luminous nebulae the process\r\nof condensation had only commenced; in others that were smaller and\r\nbrighter it was in a more advanced stage; in those that contained nuclei\r\nthere was evidence of nascent stars; and, finally, there could be seen\r\nin some nebulae minute stellar points--new-born suns--interspersed among\r\nthe haze of the transforming mass. By this theory Herschel was able to\r\naccount for the phenomena associated with nebulous stars and the\r\nsupposed changes which were observed in some nebulae. The nebular\r\nhypothesis as described by Herschel was not received with much favour,\r\nnor did it unsettle much the belief that all nebulae were vast stellar\r\naggregations, and that their cloudy luminosity was a consequence of the\r\ninadequacy of telescopic power to resolve them into their component\r\nstars. Laplace, who was highly gifted as a geometrician, demonstrated\r\nhow the solar system could have been evolved in accordance with\r\ndynamical principles from a slowly rotating and slowly contracting\r\nspheroidal nebula. The rotatory motion of a nebula, in obedience to a\r\nwell-known mechanical law, increases as its density becomes greater, and\r\nthis goes on until the tangential force at the equator overcomes the\r\ngravitational attraction at its centre. When this occurs, a revolving\r\nring of nebulous matter is thrown off from the parent mass, and by this\r\nmeans equilibrium is restored between the two forces. As the rotatory\r\nvelocity of the nebula continues to increase with its contraction,\r\nanother ring is cast off, and in this manner a succession of revolving\r\nrings may be detached from the condensing spheroid; each newly-formed\r\nring being nearer to the centre of the contracting mass and revolving in\r\na shorter period than its predecessor. In the evolution of our system,\r\nthe central mass of the nebula became the Sun and each of the revolving\r\nrings, by their condensation into one mass, formed a planet. In a\r\nsimilar manner, though on a diminished scale, the elementary planets,\r\nwhilst in a nebulous state, parted with annular portions of their\r\nsubstance, out of which were evolved their systems of satellites. This\r\ntheory furnished a plausible reason, which was capable of explaining how\r\nthe orbs which constitute the solar system came into existence, and,\r\nthough hypothetical, yet the manner in which it accounted for the\r\norderly and symmetrical genesis of the system rendered it attractive and\r\nfascinating to scientific minds.\r\n\r\nThe evidence in support of the nebulous origin of the solar system, if\r\nnot conclusive, is of much weight and importance. The remarkable harmony\r\nwith which the orbs of the system perform their motions is strongly\r\nindicative of their common origin and that their evolution occurred in\r\nsubordination to the law of universal gravitation. The following are the\r\ncharacteristic points in favour of this theory:--\r\n\r\n1. All the planets revolve round the Sun in the same direction, and they\r\nall occupy nearly the same plane.\r\n\r\n2. Their satellites, with the exception of those of Uranus and Neptune,\r\nperform their revolutions in obedience to the same law.\r\n\r\n3. The rotation on their axes of the Sun, planets, and satellites is in\r\nthe same direction as their orbital motion.\r\n\r\nBetween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter there revolves a remarkable group\r\nof small planets or planetoids. On account of the absence of a planet in\r\nthis region, where, according to the laws of planetary distances, one\r\nought to be found, the existence of those small bodies was suspected for\r\nsome years prior to their discovery. The first was detected by Piazzi at\r\nPalermo in 1801; two others were discovered by Olbers in 1802 and 1807,\r\nand one by Harding in 1804. For some time it was believed that no more\r\nplanetoids existed, but in 1845 a fifth was detected by Hencke, and from\r\nthat year until now upwards of 300 of those small bodies have been\r\ndiscovered. Their magnitudes are of varied extent; the diameter of the\r\nlargest is believed not to exceed 450 miles, and that of the smaller\r\nones from twenty to thirty miles. It was surmised at one time, when only\r\na few of those bodies were known, that they were the fragments of a\r\nplanet which met with some terrible catastrophe; but since the discovery\r\nof so many other planetoids this theory cannot be maintained. According\r\nto the nebular hypothesis, these bodies are the consolidated portions of\r\na nebulous ring which remained separate instead of having coalesced into\r\none mass so as to form a planet. The uniform condensation of the ring\r\nwould result in the formation of a multitude of small planets similar to\r\nwhat are found between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In Saturn's ring\r\nwe have a remarkable instance of annular consolidation in which the form\r\nof the ring has been preserved. The ring is believed to consist of\r\nmyriads of minute bodies, each of which travels in an orbit of its own\r\nas it pursues its path round the planet; the close approximation and\r\nexceeding minuteness of those moving objects create the appearance of a\r\nsolid continuous ring.\r\n\r\nThough, by means of the nebular hypothesis, it is impossible to explain\r\nall the phenomena associated with the motions of the orbs which enter\r\ninto the structure of the solar system, yet this does not detract much\r\nfrom the merits of the theory, the fundamental principles of which are\r\nbased upon the evolution of the solar system from a rotating nebula.\r\nThe retrograde motions of the satellites of Uranus and Neptune, the\r\nvelocity of the inner Martian moon, and other abnormalities in the\r\nsystem, have not as yet been explained, but doubtless there are reasons\r\nby which those peculiarities can be accounted for if they were only\r\nknown, '_felix qui potuit cognoscere causas omnium rerum_.'\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to supplant the nebular hypothesis by any other\r\ntheory of cosmical evolution. Modern investigations and discoveries have\r\nstrengthened its position, and at present it is the only means by which\r\nwe can account for the existence of the visible material universe by\r\nwhich we are surrounded.\r\n\r\nIn the days when Milton lived--three hundred years ago--the nocturnal\r\nheavens presented the same appearance to an observer as they do at the\r\npresent time. The stars pursued their identical paths, and looked down\r\nupon the Earth with the same aspect of serene tranquillity, regardless\r\nof the vicissitudes which affect the inhabitants of this terrestrial\r\nsphere. The constellations that adorn the celestial vault duly appeared\r\nin their seasons,\r\n\r\n                    and in the ascending scale\r\n    Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose.--iv. 354-55.\r\n\r\nThe winter glories of Orion, the scintillating brilliancy of Sirius, and\r\nthe spangled firmament, bearing no impress of change or variation which\r\nwould lead one to conclude that the heavens were other than eternal,\r\nattracted then, as now, the admiration of beholders.\r\n\r\nApart from the orbs which constitute the solar system, little was known\r\nof the sidereal heavens beyond the visual effect created by the\r\nnocturnal aspect of the star-lit sky. Though ancient philosophers\r\nhazarded an opinion that the stars were suns, they received but scant\r\nattention from early astronomers, by whom they were merely regarded as\r\nconvenient fixed points which enabled them to determine with greater\r\naccuracy the positions of the planets and the paths traced out by them\r\nin the heavens. The Ptolemaists, who believed in the diurnal revolution\r\nof the spheres, assigned to the stars a very subordinate place in their\r\ncosmology, which was the one adopted by Milton; and although Copernicus\r\nrelegated them to their proper location in space, yet he had no clear\r\nconception of a universe of stars. Tycho Brahe, who declined to accept\r\nthe Copernican theory, disbelieved that the stars were suns, and\r\nGalileo, who discovered the stellar nature of the Milky Way, remarked\r\nthat the stars were not illumined by the Sun's rays in the same manner\r\nthat the planets are, but expressed no opinion with regard to their\r\nphysical constitution. It is only within the past fifty years that proof\r\nhas been obtained of the real nature of the stars. By the spectroscopic\r\nanalysis of their light it has been ascertained that the elements of\r\nmatter which enter into their composition exist in a condition similar\r\nto what is found in the Sun. The stars are therefore suns, many of them\r\nsurpassing in magnitude and brilliancy the great luminary of our\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThough Milton makes frequent allusion to the magnificence of the starry\r\nheavens, we have no evidence that he regarded the stars as suns, nor\r\ndoes he refer to them as such in any part of his poem.[12] What\r\nimpressed him most was their number and brilliancy, to which reference\r\nis made in the following passages:\r\n\r\n    About him all the Sanctities of Heaven\r\n    Stood thick as stars.--iii. 60-61.\r\n\r\n    And sowed with stars the Heavens thick as a field.--vii. 358.\r\n\r\n    Amongst innumerable stars, that shone\r\n    Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds.--iii. 564-65.\r\n\r\n                                            her reign\r\n    With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,\r\n    With thousand thousand stars, that then appeared\r\n    Spangling the hemisphere.--vii. 381-84.\r\n\r\nMilton describes the number of the fallen angels as\r\n\r\n                              an host\r\n    Innumerable as the stars of night.--v. 744-45,\r\n\r\nand the attention of Satan is directed by the archangel Uriel to the\r\nmultitude of stars formed from the chaotic elements of matter:\r\n\r\n    Numberless as thou seest, and how they move;\r\n    Each had his place appointed, each his course;\r\n    The rest in circuit walls this universe.--iii. 719-21.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThough Milton was doubtless familiar with the leading orbs of the\r\nfirmament and knew their names, and the constellations in which they are\r\nsituated, yet he makes no direct allusion to any of them in his poem.\r\nNeither Arcturus, which is mentioned in the Book of Job, nor Sirius,\r\nwhich attracted the attention of Homer, who compared the brightness of\r\nAchilles' armour to the dazzling brilliancy of the dog-star, finds a\r\nplace in 'Paradise Lost.' And yet the superior magnitude and brilliancy\r\nof some stars when compared with those of others did not escape Milton's\r\nobservation when, in describing the lofty eminence of Satan in heaven,\r\nprior to his fall, he represents him as\r\n\r\n                      brighter once amidst the host\r\n    Of angels than that star the stars among.--vii. 132-33.\r\n\r\nThere is but one star to which Milton makes individual allusion, and,\r\nthough not of any conspicuous brilliancy, yet it is one of much\r\nimportance to astronomers--\r\n\r\n            the fleecy star that bears\r\n    Andromeda far off Atlantic seas\r\n    Beyond the horizon.--iii. 558-60.\r\n\r\nThis is Alpha Arietis, the first point in the constellation of that\r\nname, which signifies the Ram, and from which the right ascensions of\r\nthe stars are measured on the celestial sphere. In the time of\r\nHipparchus the ecliptic intersected the celestial equator in Aries,\r\nwhich indicated the commencement of the astronomical year and the\r\noccurrence of the vernal equinox; but, owing to precession, this point\r\nis now 30 deg. westward of Aries and in the constellation Pisces. The star\r\nwas called Hamal by the Arabs, signifying a sheep, and the animal is\r\nrepresented as looking backwards. Manilius writes:--\r\n\r\n    First Aries, glorious in his golden wool,\r\n    Looks back and wonders at the mighty Bull.\r\n\r\nAries is associated with the legend of the Golden Fleece, in quest of\r\nwhich Jason and his valiant crew sailed in the ship 'Argo.' In the\r\nautumn, Andromeda is situated above Aries, and would seem to be borne by\r\nthe latter, which accounts for Milton's description of the relative\r\npositions of those two constellations.\r\n\r\nMilton alludes to the starry sphere in several passages in his poem, and\r\nalso mentions the starry pole above which he soared in imagination up to\r\nthe Empyrean or Heaven of Heavens. His contemplation of the Galaxy must\r\nhave impressed his mind with the magnitude and extent of the sidereal\r\nuniverse, for he was aware that this luminous zone which encircles the\r\nheavens consists of myriads of stars, so remote as to be incapable of\r\ndefinition by unaided vision. Milton's description of this vast\r\nassemblage of stars is worthy of its magnificence, and the purpose with\r\nwhich he poetically associates this glorified highway testifies to the\r\nsublimity of his thoughts and to the originality of his genius. In those\r\nparts of his poem in which he describes the glories of the celestial\r\nregions, and instances the beautiful phenomena associated with the\r\nindividual orbs of the firmament, we are able to perceive with what\r\nexquisite delight he beheld them all.\r\n\r\nThe invention of the telescope, and the important discoveries made by\r\nKepler, Galileo, and Newton in the seventeenth century, were the means\r\nof effecting a rapid advance in the science of astronomy; but that\r\nbranch of it known as sidereal astronomy was not then in existence. The\r\nstar depths, owing to inadequate telescopic power, remained unexplored,\r\nand the secrets associated with those distant regions were inviolable,\r\nand lay beyond the reach of human knowledge. The physical constitution\r\nof the stars was unknown, nor was it ascertained with any degree of\r\ncertainty that they were suns. The knowledge possessed by astronomers in\r\nthose days was but meagre compared with what is now known of the\r\nsidereal heavens. Milton's astronomical knowledge, we find, was\r\ncommensurate with what was known of the stellar universe, and this he\r\nhas conspicuously displayed in his poem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF CELESTIAL OBJECTS MENTIONED IN 'PARADISE LOST'\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUN\r\n\r\nThe surpassing splendour of the Sun, as compared with that of any of the\r\nother orbs of the firmament, is not more impressive than his stupendous\r\nmagnitude, and the important functions which it is his prerogative to\r\nfulfil. Situated at the centre of our system--of which he may be\r\nregarded as 'both eye and soul'--the orb has a diameter approaching\r\n1,000,000 miles, and a mass 750 times greater than that of all the\r\nplanets combined. These, by his attractive power, he retains in their\r\nseveral paths and orbits, and even far distant Neptune acknowledges his\r\npotent sway. With prodigal liberality he dispenses his vast stores of\r\nlight and heat, which illumine and vivify the worlds circling around\r\nhim, and upon the constant supply of which all animated beings depend\r\nfor their existence. Deprived of the light of the Sun, this world would\r\nbe enveloped in perpetual darkness, and we should all miserably perish.\r\n\r\nThe Sun is distant from the Earth about 93,000,000 miles. His diameter\r\nis 867,000 miles, or nearly four times the extent of the radius of the\r\nMoon's orbit. The mass of the orb exceeds that of the Earth 330,000\r\ntimes, and in volume 1,305,000 times. The Sun is a sphere, and rotates\r\non his axis from west to east in 25 days 8 hours. The velocity of a\r\npoint at the solar equator is 4,407 miles an hour. The density of the\r\nSun is only one-fourth that of the Earth, or, in other words, bulk for\r\nbulk, the Earth is four times heavier than the Sun. The force of gravity\r\nat the Sun's surface is twenty-seven times greater than it is on the\r\nEarth; it would therefore be impossible for beings constituted as we are\r\nto exist on the solar surface.\r\n\r\nThe dazzling luminous envelope which indicates to the naked eye the\r\nboundary of the solar disc is called the PHOTOSPHERE. It is most\r\nbrilliant at the centre of the Sun, and diminishes in brightness towards\r\nthe circumference, where its luminosity is but one-fourth that of the\r\ncentral portion of the disc. The photosphere consists of gaseous vapours\r\nor clouds, of irregular form and size, separated by less brilliant\r\ninterstices, and glowing white with the heat derived from the interior\r\nof the Sun. In the telescope the photosphere is not of uniform\r\nbrilliancy, but presents a mottled or granular appearance, an effect\r\ncreated by the intermixture of spaces of unequal brightness. Small\r\nnodules of intense brilliance, resembling 'rice-grains,' but which,\r\naccording to Nasmyth, are of a willow-leaf shape with pointed\r\nextremities, which form a network over portions of the photosphere, are\r\nsprinkled profusely over a more faintly luminous background. These\r\n'grains' consist of irregular rounded masses, having an area of several\r\nhundred miles. By the application of a high magnifying power they can be\r\nresolved into 'granules'--minute luminous dots which constitute\r\none-fifth of the Sun's surface and emit three-fourths of the light. This\r\ngranulation is not uniform over the surface of the photosphere; in some\r\nparts it is indistinct, and appears to be replaced by interlacing\r\nfilamentous bands, which are most apparent in the penumbrae of the spots\r\nand around the spots themselves. The 'granules' are the tops of\r\nascending masses of intensely luminous vapour; the comparatively dark\r\n'pores' consist of similar descending masses, which, having radiated\r\ntheir energy, are returning to be again heated underneath the surface of\r\nthe photosphere.\r\n\r\nIn certain regions of the photosphere several dark patches are usually\r\nvisible, which are called 'sun-spots.' At occasional times they are\r\nalmost entirely absent from the solar disc. It has been observed that\r\nthey occupy a zone extending from 10 deg. to 35 deg. north and south of the\r\nsolar equator, but are not found in the equatorial and polar regions of\r\nthe Sun. A sun-spot is usually described as consisting of an irregular\r\ndark central portion, called the _umbra_; surrounding it is an edging or\r\nfringe less dark, consisting of filaments radiating inwards called the\r\n_penumbra_. Within the umbra there is sometimes seen a still darker\r\nspot, called the _nucleus_. The umbra is generally uniformly dark, but\r\nat times filmy luminous clouds have been observed floating over it. The\r\nnucleus is believed to be the orifice of a tubular depression in the\r\nfloor of the umbra, prolonged downwards to an unknown depth. The\r\npenumbra is brightest at its inner edge, where the filaments present a\r\nmarked contrast when compared with the dark cavity of the umbra which\r\nthey surround and overhang. Sometimes lengthened processes unite with\r\nthose of the opposite side and form bands and 'bridges' across the\r\numbra. The darkest portion of the penumbra is its external edge, which\r\nstands out conspicuously against the adjoining bright surface of the\r\nSun. One penumbra will sometimes enclose several umbrae whilst the nuclei\r\nmay be entirely wanting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--A Sun-spot magnified.\r\n\r\n(_Janssen._)]\r\n\r\nSun-spots usually appear in groups; large isolated spots are of rare\r\noccurrence, and are generally accompanied by several smaller ones of\r\nless perfect formation. The exact moment of the origin of a sun-spot\r\ncannot be ascertained, because it arises from an imperceptible point; it\r\ngrows very rapidly, and often attains its full size in a day.\r\n\r\nPrior to its appearance there is an unusual disturbance of the solar\r\nsurface over the site of the spot: luminous ridges, called _faculae_, and\r\ndark 'pores' become conspicuous, between which greyish patches appear,\r\nthat seem to lie underneath a thin layer of the photosphere; this is\r\nrapidly dispelled and a fully formed spot comes into view. When a\r\nsun-spot has completed its period of existence, the photospheric matter\r\noverwhelms the penumbra, and rushes into the umbra, which it\r\nobliterates, causing the spot to disappear. The duration of sun-spots is\r\nsubject to considerable variation; some last for weeks or months, and\r\nothers for a few days or hours. A spot when once fully formed maintains\r\nits shape, which is usually rounded, until the period of its breaking\r\nup. Spots of long duration rotate with the Sun. Those which become\r\nvisible at the edge of the Sun's limb have been observed to travel\r\nacross his disc in less than a fortnight, disappearing at the margin of\r\nthe opposite limb; afterwards, if sufficiently long-lived, they have\r\nreappeared in twelve or thirteen days on the surface of the orb where\r\nfirst observed. It was by observation of the spots that the period of\r\nthe axial rotation of the Sun became known.\r\n\r\nSun-spots vary very much in size--some are only a few hundred miles in\r\nwidth, whilst others have a diameter of 40,000 or 50,000 miles or\r\nupwards. In some instances the umbra alone has a breadth of 20,000 or\r\n30,000 miles--three times the extent of the diameter of the Earth. Spots\r\nof this size are visible to the naked eye when the Sun is partially\r\nobscured by fog, or when his brilliancy is diminished by vapours near\r\nthe horizon. A year seldom passes without the occurrence of several of\r\nsuch spots being recorded. The largest sun-spot ever observed had a\r\ndiameter of about 150,000 miles. A group of spots, including their\r\npenumbrae, will occupy an area of many millions of square miles.\r\n\r\nBy long observation it has been ascertained that sun-spots increase and\r\ndiminish in number with periodical regularity, and that a maximum\r\nsun-spot period occurs at the end of each eleven years. When spots are\r\nnumerous on the Sun's disc there is great disturbance of the solar\r\nsurface, accompanied by fierce rushes of intensely heated gases. This\r\nsolar activity is known to influence terrestrial magnetism by causing a\r\nmarked oscillation of the magnetic needle, and giving rise to so-called\r\n'magnetic storms,' accompanied by magnificent displays of aurorae, with\r\nvariations in electrical earth-currents. It would therefore appear that\r\nsun-spots have a pronounced effect upon magnetic terrestrial phenomena,\r\nbut how this is produced remains unknown.\r\n\r\nBesides sun-spots, there are seen on the solar disc bright flocculent\r\nstreaks or ridges of luminous matter called _faculae_; they are found\r\nover the whole surface of the Sun, but are most numerous near the limb\r\nand in the immediate vicinity of the spots. They have been compared to\r\nimmense waves--vast upheavals of photospheric matter, indicative of\r\nenormous pressure, and often extending in length for many thousands of\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nNearly all observers have arrived at the conclusion that sun-spots are\r\ndepressions or cavities in the photosphere, but considerable difference\r\nof opinion exists as to how they are formed. The most commonly accepted\r\ntheory is that they are caused by the pressure of descending masses of\r\nvapour having a reduced temperature, which absorb the light and prevent\r\nit reaching us. Our knowledge of the Sun is insufficient to admit of any\r\naccurate conclusion on this point; though we are able to perceive that\r\nthe surface of the orb is in a state of violent agitation and perpetual\r\nchange, yet his great distance and intense luminosity prevent our\r\ncapability of perceiving the ultimate minuter details which go to form\r\nthe _texture_ of the solar surface. 'Bearing in mind that a second of\r\narc on the Sun represents 455 miles, it follows that an object 150 miles\r\nin diameter is about the _minimum visible_ even as a mere mathematical\r\npoint, and that anything that is sufficiently large to give the\r\nslightest impression of shape and extension of surface must have an\r\narea of at least a quarter of a million square miles; ordinarily\r\nspeaking, we shall not gather much information about any object that\r\ncovers less than a million.'[13] Since the British Islands have only an\r\narea of 120,700 square miles, it is evident that on the surface of the\r\nSun there are many phenomena and physical changes occurring which escape\r\nour observation. Though the changes which occur in the spots and faculae\r\nappear to be slow when observed through the telescope, yet in reality\r\nthey are not so. Tremendous storms and cyclones of intensely heated\r\ngases, which may be compared to the flames arising from a great furnace,\r\nsweep over different areas of the Sun with a velocity of hundreds of\r\nmiles an hour. Vast ridges and crests of incandescent vapour are\r\nupheaved by the action of internal heat, which exceeds in intensity the\r\ntemperature at which the most refractory of terrestrial substances can\r\nbe volatilised; and downrushes of the same photospheric matter take\r\nplace after it has parted with some of its stores of thermal energy.\r\nSun-spots of considerable magnitude have been observed to grow rapidly\r\nand then disappear in a very short period of time; occasionally a spot\r\nis seen to divide into two or more portions, the fragments flying\r\nasunder with a velocity of not less than 1,000 miles an hour. It is by\r\nthese upheavals and convulsions of the solar atmosphere that the light\r\nand heat are maintained which illumine and vivify the worlds that\r\ngravitate round the Sun.\r\n\r\nDuring total eclipses of the Sun, several phenomena become visible which\r\nhave enabled astronomers to gain some further knowledge of the nature of\r\nthe solar appendages. The most important of these is the CHROMOSPHERE,\r\nwhich consists of layers of incandescent gases that envelop the\r\nphotosphere and completely surround the Sun. Its average depth is from\r\n5,000 to 6,000 miles, and when seen during an eclipse is of a beautiful\r\nrose colour, resembling a sheet of flame. As seen in profile at the edge\r\nof the Sun's disc, it presents an irregular serrated appearance, an\r\neffect created by the protuberance of luminous ridges and\r\nprocesses--masses of flame which arise from over its entire surface. The\r\nchromosphere consists chiefly of glowing hydrogen, and an element called\r\n_helium_, which has been recently discovered in a terrestrial substance\r\ncalled cleveite; there are also present the vapours of iron, calcium,\r\ncerium, titanium, barium, and magnesium. From the surface of this ocean\r\nof fire, jets and pointed spires of flaming hydrogen shoot up with\r\namazing velocity, and attain an altitude of ten, twenty, fifty, and even\r\none hundred thousand miles in a very short period of time. They are,\r\nhowever, of an evanescent nature, change rapidly in form and appearance,\r\nand often in the course of an hour or two die down so as not to be\r\nrecognisable. These _prominences_, as they are called, have been divided\r\ninto two classes. Some are in masses that float like clouds in the\r\natmosphere, which they resemble in form and appearance; they are\r\nusually attached to the chromosphere by a single stem, or by slender\r\ncolumns; occasionally they are entirely free. These are called\r\n_quiescent_ prominences; they consist of clouds of hydrogen, and are of\r\nmore lasting duration than the other variety, called _eruptive_ or\r\nmetallic prominences. The latter are usually found in the vicinity of\r\nsun-spots, and, besides hydrogen, contain the vapours of various metals.\r\nThey are of different forms, and present the appearance of filaments,\r\nspikes, and jets of liquid fire; others are pyramidal, convoluted, and\r\nparabolic.\r\n\r\nThese outbursts, bending over like the jets from a fountain, and\r\ndescending in graceful curves of flame, ascend from the surface of the\r\nchromosphere with a velocity often exceeding 100 miles in a second, and\r\nfrequently reach an enormous height, but are of transient duration. They\r\nare closely connected with sun-spots, and are evidence of the tremendous\r\nforces that are in action on the surface of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe CORONA is an aureole of light which is seen to surround the Sun\r\nduring a total eclipse. It is an impressive and beautiful phenomenon,\r\nand is only visible when the Sun is concealed behind the dark body of\r\nthe Moon. Professor Young gives the following graphic description of the\r\ncorona: 'From behind it [the Moon] stream out on all sides radiant\r\nfilaments, beams, and sheets of pearly light, which reach to a distance\r\nsometimes of several degrees from the solar surface, forming an\r\nirregular stellate halo, with the black globe of the Moon in its\r\napparent centre. The portion nearest the Sun is of dazzling brightness,\r\nbut still less brilliant than the prominences, which blaze through it\r\nlike carbuncles. Generally this inner corona has a pretty uniform\r\nheight, forming a ring three or four minutes of arc in width, separated\r\nby a somewhat definite outline from the outer corona, which reaches to a\r\nmuch greater distance and is far more irregular in form. Usually there\r\nare several \"rifts,\" as they have been called, like narrow beams of\r\ndarkness, extending from the very edge of the Sun to the outer night,\r\nand much resembling the cloud shadows which radiate from the Sun before\r\na thundershower. But the edges of these rifts are frequently curved,\r\nshowing them to be something else than real shadows. Sometimes there are\r\nnarrow bright streamers as long as the rifts, or longer. These are often\r\ninclined, or occasionally even nearly tangential to the solar surface,\r\nand frequently are curved. On the whole, the corona is usually less\r\nextensive and brilliant over the solar poles, and there is a\r\nrecognisable tendency to accumulation above the middle latitudes, or\r\nspot zones; so that, speaking roughly, the corona shows a disposition to\r\nassume the form of a quadrilateral or four-rayed star, though in almost\r\nevery individual case this form is greatly modified by abnormal\r\nstreamers at some point or other.' The corona surrounds the Sun and its\r\nother envelopes to a depth of many thousands of miles. It consists of\r\nvarious elements which exist in a condition of extreme tenuity;\r\nhydrogen, helium, and a substance called coronium appear to predominate,\r\nwhilst finely divided shining particles of matter and electrical\r\ndischarges resembling those of an aurora assist in its illumination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--The Corona during the Eclipse of May 1883.]\r\n\r\nWe possess no knowledge of the physical structure of the interior of the\r\nSun, nor have we any terrestrial analogy to guide us as to how matter\r\nwould behave when subjected to such conditions of extreme temperature\r\nand pressure as exist in the interior of the orb. Yet we are justified\r\nin concluding that the Sun is mainly a gaseous sphere which is slowly\r\ncontracting, and that the energy expended in this process is being\r\ntransformed into heat so extreme as to render the orb a great fountain\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nMilton in his poem makes more frequent allusion to the Sun than to any\r\nof the other orbs of the firmament, and, in all his references to the\r\ngreat luminary, describes him in a manner worthy of his unrivalled\r\nsplendour, and of his supreme importance in the system which he upholds\r\nand governs. After having alighted on Mount Niphates, Satan is described\r\nas looking\r\n\r\n    Sometimes towards Heaven and the full-blazing Sun,\r\n    Which now sat high in his meridian tower.--iv. 29-30.\r\n\r\nHe then addresses him thus:--\r\n\r\n    O thou that with surpassing glory crowned,\r\n    Look'st from thy sole dominion like the god\r\n    Of this new World--at whose sight all the stars\r\n    Hide their diminished heads--to thee I call,\r\n    But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,\r\n    O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams,\r\n    That bring to my remembrance from what state\r\n    I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere.--iv. 32-39.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion:--\r\n\r\n    The golden Sun in splendour likest Heaven\r\n    Allured his eye.--iii. 572-73.\r\n\r\nIn describing the different periods of the day, Milton seldom fails to\r\nassociate the Sun with these times, and rightly so, since they are\r\nbrought about by the apparent diurnal journey of the orb across the\r\nheavens. Commencing with morning, he says:--\r\n\r\n                                    Meanwhile,\r\n    To re-salute the world with sacred light,\r\n    Leucothea waked, and with fresh dews embalmed\r\n    The Earth.--xi. 133-36.\r\n\r\n    Soon as they forth were come to open sight\r\n    Of day-spring, and the Sun--who, scarce up-risen,\r\n    With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,\r\n    Shot parallel to the Earth his dewy ray,\r\n    Discovering in wide landskip all the east\r\n    Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains.--v. 138-43\r\n\r\n                          or some renowned metropolis\r\n    With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,\r\n    Which now the rising Sun gilds with his beams.--iii. 549-51.\r\n\r\n                      while now the mounted Sun\r\n    Shot down direct his fervid rays, to warm\r\n    Earth's inmost womb.--v. 300-302.\r\n\r\n                                  for scarce the Sun\r\n    Hath finished half his journey, and scarce begins\r\n    His other half in the great zone of Heaven.--v. 558-60.\r\n\r\n    To sit and taste, till this meridian heat\r\n    Be over, and the Sun more cool decline.--v. 369-70.\r\n\r\n    And the great Light of Day yet wants to run\r\n    Much of his race, though steep. Suspense in Heaven,\r\n    Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he hears,\r\n    And longer will delay, to hear thee tell\r\n    His generation, and the rising birth\r\n    Of Nature from the unapparent deep.--vii. 98-103.\r\n\r\nThe declining day and approach of evening are described as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile in utmost longitude, where Heaven\r\n    With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun\r\n    Slowly descended, and with right aspect\r\n    Against the eastern gate of Paradise\r\n    Levelled his evening rays.--iv. 539-43.\r\n\r\n                            the Sun now fallen\r\n    Beneath the Azores; whether the Prime Orb,\r\n    Incredible how swift, had thither rolled\r\n    Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth,\r\n    By shorter flight to the east, had left him there\r\n    Arraying with reflected purple and gold\r\n    The clouds that on his western throne attend.--iv. 591-97.\r\n\r\n                                  the parting Sun\r\n    Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles\r\n    Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.--viii. 630-32.\r\n\r\n    Now was the Sun in western cadence low\r\n    From noon, and gentle airs due at their hour\r\n    To fan the Earth now waked, and usher in\r\n    The evening cool.--x. 92-95.\r\n\r\n                                      for the Sun,\r\n    Declined, was hasting now with prone career\r\n    To the Ocean Isles, and in the ascending scale\r\n    Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose.--iv. 352-55.\r\n\r\nIn the combat between Michael and Satan, which ended in the overthrow of\r\nthe rebel angels, Milton, in his description of their armour, says:--\r\n\r\n                  two broad suns their shields\r\n    Blazed opposite.--vi. 305-306,\r\n\r\nand in describing the faded splendour of the ruined Archangel, the poet\r\ncompares him to the Sun when seen under conditions which temporarily\r\ndeprive him of his dazzling brilliancy and glory:--\r\n\r\n                        as when the Sun new-risen\r\n    Looks through the horizontal misty air\r\n    Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the Moon\r\n    In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds\r\n    On half the nations, and with fear of change\r\n    Perplexes monarchs.--i. 594-99.\r\n\r\nThis passage affords us an example of the sublimity of Milton's\r\nimagination and of his skill in adapting the grandest phenomena in\r\nNature to the illustration of his subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOON\r\n\r\nThe Moon is the Earth's satellite, and next to the Sun is the most\r\nimportant of the celestial orbs so far as its relations with our globe\r\nare concerned. Besides affording us light by night, the Moon is the\r\nprincipal cause of the ebb and flow of the tide--a phenomenon of much\r\nimportance to navigators. The Moon is almost a perfect sphere, and is\r\n2,160 miles in diameter. The form of its orbit is that of an ellipse\r\nwith the Earth in the lower focus. It revolves round its primary in 27\r\ndays 7 hours, at a mean distance of 237,000 miles, and with a velocity\r\nof 2,273 miles an hour. Its equatorial velocity of rotation is 10 miles\r\nan hour. The density of the Moon is 3.57 that of water, or 0.63 that of\r\nthe Earth; eighty globes, each of the weight of the Moon, would be\r\nrequired to counterbalance the weight of the Earth, and fifty globes of\r\na similar size to equal it in dimensions. The orb rotates on its axis in\r\nthe same period of time in which it accomplishes a revolution of its\r\norbit; consequently the same illumined surface of the Moon is always\r\ndirected towards the Earth. To the naked eye the Moon appears as large\r\nas the Sun, and it very rapidly changes its form and position in the\r\nsky. Its motions, which are of a very complex character, have been for\r\nmany ages the subject of investigation by mathematicians and\r\nastronomers, but their difficulties may now be regarded as having been\r\nfinally overcome.\r\n\r\nThe phases of the Moon are always interesting and very beautiful. The\r\norb is first seen in the west, after sunset, as a delicate slender\r\ncrescent of pale light; each night it increases in size, whilst it\r\ntravels eastward, until it attains the figure of a half moon; still\r\ngrowing larger as it pursues its course, it finally becomes a full\r\nresplendent globe, rising about the time that the Sun sets and situated\r\ndirectly opposite to him. Then, in a reverse manner, after full moon, it\r\ngoes through the same phases, until, as a slender crescent, it becomes\r\ninvisible in the solar rays; afterwards to re-appear in a few days, and,\r\nin its monthly round, to undergo the same cycle of changes. The phases\r\nof the Moon depend upon the changing position of the orb with regard to\r\nthe Sun. The Moon shines by reflected light derived from the Sun, and as\r\none half of its surface is always illumined and the other half totally\r\ndark, the crescent increases or diminishes when, by the Moon's change of\r\nposition, we see more or less of the bright side. Visible at first as a\r\nslender crescent near the setting Sun, the angular distance from the orb\r\nand the width of the crescent increase daily, until, at the expiration\r\nof seven days, the Moon is distant one quarter of the circumference of\r\nthe heavens from the Sun. The Moon is then a semi-circle, or in\r\nquadrature. At the end of other seven days, the distance of the Moon\r\nfrom the Sun is at its greatest--half the circumference of its orbit. It\r\nis then visible as a circular disc and we behold the orb as full moon.\r\nThe waning Moon, as it gradually decreases, presents the same aspects\r\nreversed, and, finally, its slender crescent disappears in the Sun's\r\nrays. The convex edge of the crescent is always turned towards the Sun.\r\nThe rising of the Moon in the east and its setting in the west is an\r\neffect due to the diurnal rotation of the Earth on her axis, but the orb\r\ncan be perceived to have two motions besides: one from west to east,\r\nwhich carries it round the heavens in 29.53 days, and another from north\r\nto south. The west to east motion is steady and continuous, but, owing\r\nto the Sun's attractive force, the Moon is made to swerve from its path,\r\ngiving rise to irregularities of its motion called PERTURBATIONS. The\r\nmost important of these is the _annual equation_, discovered by Tycho\r\nBrahe--a yearly effect produced by the Sun's disturbing influence as the\r\nEarth approaches or recedes from him in her orbit; another irregularity,\r\ncalled the _evection_, is a change in the eccentricity of the lunar\r\norbit, by which the mean longitude of the Moon is increased or\r\ndiminished. _Elliptic inequality_, _parallactic inequality_, the\r\n_variation_, and _secular acceleration_, are other perturbations of the\r\nlunar motion, which depend directly or indirectly on the attractive\r\ninfluence of the Sun and the motion of the Earth in her orbit.\r\n\r\nAs the plane of the Moon's orbit is inclined at an angle of rather more\r\nthan 5 deg. to the ecliptic, it follows that the orb, in its journey round\r\nthe Earth, intersects this great circle at two points called the\r\n'Nodes.' When crossing the ecliptic from south to north the Moon is in\r\nits ascending node, and when crossing from north to south in its\r\ndescending node. In December the Moon reaches the most northern point of\r\nits course, and in June the southernmost. Consequently we have during\r\nthe winter nights the greatest amount of moonlight, and in summer the\r\nleast. In the evenings the moonlight is least in March and greatest in\r\nSeptember, when we have what is called the Harvest Moon.\r\n\r\nThe telescopic appearance of the Moon is very interesting and beautiful,\r\nespecially if the orb is observed when waxing and waning. As no aqueous\r\nvapour or cloud obscures the lunar surface, all its details can be\r\nperceived with great clearness and distinctness. Indeed, the topography\r\nof the Moon is better known than that of the Earth, for the whole of its\r\nsurface has been mapped and delineated with great accuracy and\r\nprecision. The Moon is in no sense a duplicate of its primary, and no\r\nanalogy exists between the Earth and her satellite. Evidence is wanting\r\nof the existence of an atmosphere surrounding the Moon; no clouds or\r\nexhalations can be perceived, and no water is believed to exist on the\r\nlunar surface. Consequently there are no oceans, seas, rivers, or lakes;\r\nno fertile plains or forest-clad mountains, such as are found upon the\r\nEarth. Indeed, all the conditions essential for the support and\r\nmaintenance of organic life by which we are surrounded appear to be\r\nnonexistent on the Moon. Our satellite has no seasons; its axial\r\nrotation is so slow that one lunar day is equal in length to fourteen of\r\nour days; this period of sunshine is succeeded by a night of similar\r\nduration. The alternation of such lengthened days and nights subjects\r\nthe lunar surface to great extremes of heat and cold.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed with a telescope, the surface of the Moon is perceived to\r\nconsist of lofty mountain chains with rugged peaks, numerous extinct\r\nvolcanoes called crater mountains, hills, clefts, chasms, valleys, and\r\nlevel plains--a region of desolation, presenting to our gaze the\r\nshattered and upturned fragments of the Moon's crust, convulsed by\r\nforces of a volcanic nature which have long since expended their\r\nenergies and died out. The mountain ranges on the Moon resemble those of\r\nthe Earth, but they have a more rugged outline, and their peaks are more\r\nprecipitous, some of them rising to a height of 20,000 feet. They are\r\ncalled the Lunar Alps, Apennines, and Cordilleras, and embrace every\r\nvariety of hill, cliff, mound, and ridge of comparatively low\r\nelevation. The plains are large level areas, which are situated on\r\nvarious parts of the lunar surface; they are of a darker hue than the\r\nmountainous regions by which they are surrounded, and were at one time\r\nbelieved to be seas. They are analogous to the prairies, steppes, and\r\ndeserts of the Earth.\r\n\r\n_Valleys._--Some of these are of spacious dimensions; others are narrow,\r\nand contract into gorges and chasms. Clefts or rills are long cracks or\r\nfissures of considerable depth, which extend sometimes for hundreds of\r\nmiles across the various strata of which the Moon's crust is composed.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic features of the Moon's surface are the crater\r\nmountains: they are very numerous on certain portions of the lunar disc,\r\nand give the Moon the freckled appearance which it presents in the\r\ntelescope, and which Galileo likened to the eyes in the feathers of a\r\npeacock's tail. They are believed to be of volcanic origin, and have\r\nbeen classified as follows: 'Walled plains, mountain rings, ring plains,\r\ncrater plains, craters, craterlets, and crater cones.' Upwards of 13,000\r\nof these mountains have been enumerated, and 1,000 are known to have a\r\ndiameter exceeding nine miles. Walled plains consist of circular areas\r\nwhich have a width varying from 150 miles to a few hundred yards. They\r\nare enclosed by rocky ramparts, whilst the centre is occupied by an\r\nelevated peak. The depth of these formations, which are often far below\r\nthe level of the Moon's surface, ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 feet.\r\nMountain rings, ring plains, and crater plains resemble those already\r\ndescribed, but are on a smaller scale; the floors of the larger ones are\r\nfrequently occupied by craters and craterlets. The latter exist in large\r\nnumbers, and some portions of the Moon's surface appear honeycombed with\r\nthem, the smaller craters resting on the sides of larger ones and\r\noccupying the bottoms of the more extensive areas. There is no kind of\r\nformation on the Earth's surface that can be compared with these crater\r\nmountains, which indicate that the Moon was at one time a fiery globe\r\nconvulsed by internal forces which found an outlet in the numerous\r\nvolcanoes scattered over her surface.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of these volcanic mountains have been named after\r\ndistinguished men. (1) Copernicus is one of the most imposing; its\r\ncrater is 56 miles in diameter, and situated at its centre is a mountain\r\nwith six peaks 2,400 feet in height. The ring by which it is surrounded\r\nrises 11,000 feet above the floor of the crater, and consists of\r\nterraces believed to have been created by the partial congelation and\r\nperiodic subsidence of a lake of molten lava which occupied the enclosed\r\narea.\r\n\r\n(2) Tycho is one of the most magnificent and perfect of lunar volcanoes,\r\nand is also remarkable as being a centre from which, when the Moon is\r\nfull, there radiates a number of bright streaks which extend across the\r\nlunar surface, over mountain and valley, through ring and crater, for\r\nmany hundreds of miles. Their nature is unknown, and nothing resembling\r\nthem is found on the Earth. Tycho has a diameter of 50 miles and a\r\ndepth of 17,000 feet. The peak which rises from the floor of the crater\r\nattains a height of 6,000 feet, and the rampart consists of a series of\r\nterraces which give variety to the appearance of the inner wall. The\r\nsurface of the Moon round Tycho is honeycombed with small volcanoes.\r\n\r\n(3) Clavius is one of the most extensive of the walled plains; it has a\r\ndiameter of 142 miles and an area of 16,500 square miles. The rocky\r\nannulus which surrounds it is very lofty and precipitous, and at one\r\npoint reaches a height of 17,300 feet. Upwards of 90 craters have been\r\ncounted within this space, one of the peaks attaining to an elevation of\r\n24,000 feet above the level floor of the plain. It is believed that the\r\nlowest depths of this wild and precipitous region are never penetrated\r\nby sunlight, they are so overshadowed by towering crag and fell which\r\nintercept the solar rays; and, as there is no atmosphere to cause\r\nreflection, they are consequently enveloped in perpetual darkness.\r\n\r\n(4) Plato has a diameter of about 60 miles and an area of 2,700 square\r\nmiles; its central peak rises to a height of 7,300 feet. It has an\r\nirregular rampart which is broken up into terraces averaging about 4,000\r\nfeet high; three cones, each with an elevation of from 7,000 to 9,000\r\nfeet, rest on its western border.\r\n\r\n(5) Theophilus is the deepest of the visible craters on the Moon. It has\r\na diameter of 64 miles, and the inner edge of the ring rises from the\r\nlevel floor to a height ranging from 14,000 to 18,000 feet. A group of\r\nmountains occupies the centre of the area, the highest peak of which\r\nreaches an elevation of 5,200 feet. Cyrillus and Catharina, two adjacent\r\ncraters, are each about 16,000 feet deep and connected by a wide valley.\r\n\r\n(6) Aristarchus is the brightest spot on the Moon, and appears almost\r\ndazzling in the telescope. The crater has a diameter of 42 miles, the\r\ncentre of which is occupied by a steep mountain. The rampart on the\r\nwestern side rises to a height of 7,500 feet, on the east it becomes a\r\nplateau which connects it with a smaller crater called Herodotus. Bright\r\nstreaks radiate from Aristarchus when there is full moon, and extend for\r\na considerable distance over the surface of the orb.\r\n\r\nThough the face of the Moon has been carefully scanned for two centuries\r\nand a half, and selenographers have mapped and delineated her features\r\nwith the utmost accuracy and precision, yet no perceptible change of a\r\nreliable character has been perceived to occur on any part of the orb.\r\nThe surface of the hemisphere directed towards the Earth appears to be\r\nan alternation of desert plains, craggy wildernesses, and extinct\r\nvolcanoes--a region of desolation unoccupied by any living thing, and\r\n'upon which the light of life has never dawned.' Owing to the absence of\r\nan atmosphere, there is neither diffuse daylight nor twilight on the\r\nMoon. Every portion of the lunar surface not exposed to the Sun's rays\r\nis shrouded in darkness, and black shadows can be observed fringing\r\nprominences of silvery whiteness. If the Moon were enveloped in an\r\natmosphere similar to that which surrounds the Earth, the reflection and\r\ndiffusion of light among the minute particles of watery vapour which\r\npermeate it would give rise to a gradual transition from light to\r\ndarkness; the lunar surface would be visible when not illumined by the\r\ndirect rays of the Sun, and before sunrise and after sunset, dawn and\r\ntwilight would occur as upon the Earth. But upon the Moon there is no\r\ndawn, and the darkness of night envelops the orb until the appearance of\r\nthe edge of the Sun's disc above the horizon, then his dazzling rays\r\nillumine the summits and loftiest peaks of the lunar mountains whilst\r\nyet their sides and bases are wrapped in deep gloom. Since the pace of\r\nthe Sun across the lunar heavens is 28 times slower than it is with us,\r\nthere is continuous sunshine on the Moon for 304 hours, and this long\r\nday--equal to about a fortnight of our time--is succeeded by a night of\r\nsimilar duration. As there is no atmosphere overhead to diffuse or\r\nreflect the light, the Sun shines in a pitch-black sky, and at lunar\r\nnoonday the planets and constellations can be seen displaying a\r\nbrilliancy of greater intensity than can be perceived on Earth during\r\nthe darkest night. Every portion of the Moon's surface is bleak, bare,\r\nand untouched by any softening influences. No gentle gale ever sweeps\r\ndown her valleys or disturbs the dead calm that hangs over this world;\r\nno cloud ever tempers the fierce glare of the Sun that pours down his\r\nunmitigated rays from a sky of inky blackness; no refreshing shower ever\r\nfalls upon her arid mountains and plains; no sound ever breaks the\r\nprofound stillness that reigns over this realm of solitude and\r\ndesolation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PORTION OF THE MOON'S SURFACE]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, Milton makes frequent allusion to the Moon in\r\n'Paradise Lost,' and does not fail to set forth the distinctive charms\r\nassociated with the unrivalled queen of the firmament. The majority of\r\npoets would most likely regard a description of evening as incomplete\r\nwithout an allusion to the Moon. Milton has adhered to this sentiment,\r\nas may be perceived in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n                                    till the Moon,\r\n    Rising in clouded majesty, at length\r\n    Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,\r\n    And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.--iv. 606-609.\r\n\r\n                                        now reigns\r\n    Full-orbed the Moon, and with more pleasing light,\r\n    Shadowy sets off the face of things.--v. 41-43.\r\n\r\nThe association of the Moon with the nocturnal revels and dances of\r\nelves and fairies is felicitously expressed in the following passage:--\r\n\r\n                                or faery elves,\r\n    Whose midnight revels, by a forest side\r\n    Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,\r\n    Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon\r\n    Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth\r\n    Wheels her pale course.--i. 781-86.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this, we have Milton's description of the Moon when\r\naffected by the demoniacal practices of the 'night-hag' who was believed\r\nto destroy infants for the sake of drinking their blood, and applying\r\ntheir mangled limbs to the purposes of incantation. The legend is of\r\nScandinavian origin and the locality Lapland:--\r\n\r\n    Nor uglier follow the night-hag, when called\r\n    In secret, riding through the air she comes,\r\n    Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance\r\n    With Lapland witches, while the labouring Moon\r\n    Eclipses at their charms.--ii. 662-66.\r\n\r\nIn his description of the massive shield carried by Satan, the poet\r\ncompares it with the full moon:--\r\n\r\n                                his ponderous shield\r\n    Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,\r\n    Behind him cast. The broad circumference\r\n    Hung on his shoulders like the Moon.--i. 284-87.\r\n\r\nThe phases displayed by the Moon in her monthly journey round the Earth,\r\nand which lend a variety of charm to the appearances presented by the\r\norb, are poetically described by Milton in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n                      but there the neighbouring Moon\r\n    (So call that opposite fair star) her aid\r\n    Timely interposes, and her monthly round\r\n    Still ending, still renewing, through mid-Heaven\r\n    With borrowed light her countenance triform\r\n    Hence fills and empties, to enlighten the Earth,\r\n    And in her pale dominion checks the night.--iii. 726-32.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe how aptly Milton describes the subdued\r\nillumination of the Moon's reflected light, as compared with the\r\nbrilliant radiance of the blazing Sun, and how the distinguishing glory\r\npeculiar to each orb is appropriately set forth in the various passages\r\nin which they are described; their contrasted splendour enhancing rather\r\nthan detracting from the grandeur and beauty belonging to each.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANET EARTH[14]\r\n\r\nNo lovelier planet circles round the Sun than the planet Earth, with her\r\noceans and continents, her mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, and\r\nplains; surrounded by heaven's azure, radiant with the sunlight of her\r\nday and adorned by night with countless sparkling points of gold. This\r\nbeautiful world, the abode of MAN, is of paramount importance to us, and\r\nis the only part of the universe of which we have any direct knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Earth may be regarded as one of the Sun's numerous family, and is\r\nsituated third in order from the refulgent orb, round which it revolves\r\nin an elliptical orbit at a mean distance of 92,800,000 miles. The Earth\r\nis nearest to the Sun at the end of December, and furthest away at the\r\nbeginning of July; the difference between those distances is 3,250,000\r\nmiles--the extent of the eccentricity of the planet's orbit. The figure\r\nof the Earth is that of an oblate spheroid; it is slightly flattened at\r\nthe poles and bulges at the equator. Its polar or shortest diameter is\r\n7,899 miles, its equatorial diameter is 7,926 miles--greater than the\r\nother by 27 miles. The circumference of the Earth at the equator is\r\n24,899 miles, and the total area of its surface is 197,000,000 square\r\nmiles. Its mean density is 5-1/2 times greater than that of water.\r\n\r\nThe two principal motions performed by the Earth are: (1) Rotation on\r\nits axis; (2) its annual revolution round the Sun. The Earth always\r\nrotates in the same manner, and in the same direction, from west to\r\neast. As the axis of rotation corresponds with the shortest diameter of\r\nthe planet, it affords strong evidence that the Earth assumed its\r\npresent shape whilst rapidly rotating round its axis when in a fluid or\r\nplastic condition. This would accord with the nebular hypothesis. The\r\nends of the Earth's axis are called the poles of the Earth; one is the\r\nnorth, the other the south pole. The north pole is directed towards a\r\nstar in the Lesser Bear called the Pole Star. The south pole is directed\r\nto a corresponding opposite part of the heavens. The Earth's axis is\r\ninclined 63 deg. 33' to the plane of the ecliptic, and is always directed to\r\nthe same point in the heavens. The Earth accomplishes a revolution on\r\nits axis in 23 hours 56 minutes 4 seconds mean solar time, which is the\r\nlength of the sidereal day. This rate of rotation is invariable. At the\r\nequator, where the circumference of the globe exceeds 24,000 miles, the\r\nvelocity of a point on its surface is upwards of 1,000 miles an hour,\r\nbut, as the poles are approached, the tangential velocity diminishes,\r\nand at those points it is entirely absent. The Earth accomplishes a\r\nrevolution of her orbit in 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes; in her journey\r\nround the Sun she travels a circuit of 580,000,000 miles at an average\r\npace of 66,000 miles an hour. The Earth has other slight motions called\r\n_perturbations_, which are produced by the gravitational attraction of\r\nother members of the solar system. The most important of these is\r\nPrecession of the Equinoxes, which is caused by the attraction of the\r\nSun, Moon, and planets, on the protuberant equatorial region of the\r\nglobe. This attraction has a tendency to turn the Earth's axis at right\r\nangles to her orbit, but it only results in the slow rotation of the\r\npole of the equator round that of the ecliptic, which is occurring at\r\nthe rate of 1 deg. in 70 years, and will require a period of 25,868 years to\r\ncomplete an entire revolution of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe spot on Earth round which is centred the chief interest in Milton's\r\npoem is Paradise, which was situated in the east of Eden, a district of\r\nCentral Asia. It was here where God ordained that man should first\r\ndwell--a place created for his enjoyment and delight. Satan, after his\r\nsoliloquy on Mount Niphates, directs his way to Paradise, and arrives\r\nfirst in Eden, where he beholds from a distance the Happy Garden--\r\n\r\n    So on he fares, and to the border comes\r\n    Of Eden, where delicious Paradise,\r\n    Now nearer, crowns with her enclosure green,\r\n    As with a rural mound, the champain head\r\n    Of a steep wilderness, whose hairy sides\r\n    With thicket overgrown, grotesque and wild,\r\n    Access denied; and overhead upgrew\r\n    Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,\r\n    Cedar, and pine, and fir, and branching palm,\r\n    A sylvan scene, and, as the ranks ascend,\r\n    Shade above shade, a woody theatre\r\n    Of stateliest view. Yet higher than their tops\r\n    The verdurous wall of Paradise up-sprung;\r\n    Which to our general sire gave prospect large\r\n    Into his nether empire neighbouring round.\r\n    And higher than that wall, a circling row\r\n    Of goodliest trees, loaden with fairest fruit,\r\n    Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue,\r\n    Appeared, with gay enamelled colours mixed;\r\n    On which the Sun more glad impressed his beams\r\n    Than in fair evening cloud, or humid bow,\r\n    When God hath showered the Earth: so lovely seemed\r\n    That landskip. And of pure now purer air\r\n    Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires\r\n    Vernal delight and joy, able to drive\r\n    All sadness but despair. Now gentle gales,\r\n    Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense\r\n    Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole\r\n    Those balmy spoils.--iv. 131-59.\r\n\r\nSatan, having gained admission to the Garden by overleaping the tangled\r\nthicket of shrubs and bushes which formed an impenetrable barrier and\r\nprevented any access to the enclosure within, he flew up on to the Tree\r\nof Life--\r\n\r\n    Beneath him, with new wonder, now he views,\r\n    To all delight of human sense exposed,\r\n    In narrow room Nature's whole wealth; yea, more!--\r\n    A Heaven on Earth: for blissful Paradise\r\n    Of God the garden was, by Him in the east\r\n    Of Eden planted, Eden stretched her line\r\n    From Auran eastward to the royal towers\r\n    Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian kings,\r\n    Or where the sons of Eden long before\r\n    Dwelt in Telassar. In this pleasant soil\r\n    His far more pleasant garden God ordained.\r\n    Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow\r\n    All trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;\r\n    And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,\r\n    High eminent, blooming ambrosial fruit\r\n    Of vegetable gold; and next to life,\r\n    Our death, the Tree of Knowledge, grew fast by--\r\n    Knowledge of good, bought dear by knowing ill.\r\n    Southward through Eden went a river large,\r\n    Nor changed his course, but through the shaggy hill\r\n    Passed underneath ingulfed; for God had thrown\r\n    That mountain, as his garden mould, high raised\r\n    Upon the rapid current, which, through veins\r\n    Of porous earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,\r\n    Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill\r\n    Watered the garden; thence united fell\r\n    Down the steep glade, and met the nether flood,\r\n    Which from his darksome passage now appears,\r\n    And now, divided into four main streams,\r\n    Runs diverse, wandering many a famous realm\r\n    And country whereof here needs no account;\r\n    But rather to tell how, if Art could tell\r\n    How, from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks,\r\n    Boiling on orient-pearl and sands of gold,\r\n    With mazy error under pendent shades\r\n    Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed\r\n    Flowers worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art\r\n    In beds and curious knots, but Nature boon\r\n    Poured forth profuse on hill, and dale, and plain,\r\n    Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote\r\n    The open field, and where the unpierced shade\r\n    Imbrowned the noontide bowers.--iv. 205-46.\r\n\r\nMilton's description of Paradise is not less remarkable in its way than\r\nthe lurid scenes depicted by him in Pandemonium. The versatility of his\r\npoetic genius is nowhere more apparent than in the charming pastoral\r\nverse contained in this part of his poem. The poet has lavished the\r\nwhole wealth of his luxuriant imagination in his description of Eden and\r\nblissful Paradise with its 'vernal airs' and 'gentle gales,' its verdant\r\nmeads, and murmuring streams, 'rolling on orient-pearl and sands of\r\ngold;' its stately trees laden with blossom and fruit; its spicy groves\r\nand shady bowers, over which there breathed the eternal Spring.\r\n\r\nIn Book IX. Satan expresses himself in an eloquent apostrophe to the\r\nprimitive Earth, over which he previously wandered for seven days--\r\n\r\n    O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred\r\n    More justly, seat worthier of gods, as built\r\n    With second thoughts, reforming what was old!\r\n    For what God, after better, worse would build?\r\n    Terrestrial Heaven, danced round by other Heavens,\r\n    That shine, yet bear their bright officious lamps,\r\n    Light above light, for thee alone, as seems,\r\n    In thee concentring all their precious beams\r\n    Of sacred influence! As God in Heaven\r\n    Is centre, yet extends to all, so thou\r\n    Centring receiv'st from all those orbs; in thee,\r\n    Not in themselves, all their known virtue appears,\r\n    Productive in herb, plant, and nobler birth\r\n    Of creatures animate with gradual life\r\n    Of growth, sense, reason, all summed up in Man,\r\n    With what delight I could have walked thee round,\r\n    If I could joy in aught--sweet interchange\r\n    Of hill and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,\r\n    Now land, now sea, and shores with forest crowned,\r\n    Rocks, dens, and caves.--ix. 99-118.\r\n\r\nThough it is impossible to regard the Earth as possessing the importance\r\nascribed to it by the ancient Ptolemaists; nevertheless, our globe is a\r\ngreat and mighty world, and appears to be one of the most favourably\r\nsituated of all the planets, being neither near the Sun nor yet very far\r\ndistant from the orb; and although, when compared with the universe, it\r\nis no more than a leaf on a tree in the midst of a vast forest; still,\r\nit is not the least important among other circling worlds, and\r\nunfailingly fulfils the part allotted to it in the great scheme of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANET HESPERUS\r\n\r\nThis is the beautiful morning and evening star, the peerless planet that\r\nushers in the twilight and the dawn, the harbinger of day and unrivalled\r\nqueen of the evening. Venus, called after the Roman goddess of Love, and\r\nalso identified with the Greek Aphrodite of ideal beauty, is the name by\r\nwhich the planet is popularly known; but Milton does not so designate\r\nit, and the name 'Venus' is not found in 'Paradise Lost.' The ancients\r\ncalled it Lucifer and Phosphor when it shone as a morning star before\r\nsunrise, and Hesperus and Vesper when it became visible after sunset. It\r\nis the most lustrous of all the planets, and at times its brilliancy is\r\nso marked as to throw a distinct shadow at night.\r\n\r\nVenus is the second planet in order from the Sun. Its orbit lies between\r\nthat of Mercury and the Earth, and in form approaches nearer to a circle\r\nthan that of any of the other planets. It travels round the Sun in\r\n224.7 days, at a mean distance of 67,000,000 miles, and with an average\r\nvelocity of 80,000 miles an hour. Its period of rotation is unknown. By\r\nthe observation of dusky spots on its surface, it has been surmised that\r\nthe planet completes a revolution on its axis in 23-1/4 hours; but other\r\nobservers doubt this and are inclined to believe that it always presents\r\nthe same face to the Sun. When at inferior conjunction Venus approaches\r\nnearer to the Earth than any other planet, its distance then being\r\n27,000,000 miles. Its greatest elongation varies from 45 deg. to 47 deg. 12'; it\r\ntherefore can never be much more than three hours above the horizon\r\nbefore sunrise, or after sunset. Venus is a morning star when passing\r\nfrom inferior to superior conjunction, and during the other half of its\r\nsynodical period it is an evening star. The planet attains its greatest\r\nbrilliancy at an elongation 40 deg. west or east of the Sun--five weeks\r\nbefore and after inferior conjunction. It is at these periods, when at\r\nits greatest brilliancy, that it casts a shadow at night.\r\n\r\nThough so pleasing an object to the unaided eye, Venus, when observed\r\nwith the telescope, is often a source of disappointment--this is on\r\naccount of its dazzling brilliancy, which renders any accurate\r\ndefinition of its surface impossible. Sir John Herschel writes: 'The\r\nintense lustre of its illuminated part dazzles the sight, and\r\nexaggerates every imperfection of the telescope; yet we see clearly that\r\nits surface is not mottled over with permanent spots like the Moon; we\r\nnotice in it neither mountains nor shadows, but a uniform brightness, in\r\nwhich sometimes we may indeed fancy, or perhaps more than fancy,\r\nbrighter or obscurer portions, but can seldom or never rest fully\r\nsatisfied of the fact.' It is believed that the surface of the planet is\r\ninvisible on account of the existence of a cloud-laden atmosphere by\r\nwhich it is enveloped, and which may serve as a protection against the\r\nintense glare of the sunshine and heat poured down by the not\r\nfar-distant Sun. Schroeter, a German astronomer, believed that he saw\r\nlofty mountains on the surface of the planet, but their existence has\r\nnot been confirmed by any other observer. The Sun if viewed from Venus\r\nwould have a diameter nearly half as large again as when seen from the\r\nEarth; it is therefore probable that the planet is subjected to a much\r\nhigher temperature than what is experienced on our globe.\r\n\r\nThe phases of Venus are similar to those exhibited by the Moon, and are\r\ncaused by a change in position of the illumined hemisphere of the planet\r\nwith regard to the Earth. At superior conjunction the whole enlightened\r\ndisc of the planet is turned towards the Earth, but is invisible by\r\nbeing lost in the Sun's rays. Shortly before or after it arrives at this\r\npoint, its form is gibbous, the illumined portion being less than a\r\ncircle but greater than a semi-circle. At its greatest elongation west\r\nor east of the Sun the planet resembles the Moon in quadrature--a half\r\nmoon--and between those points and inferior conjunction it is visible\r\nas a beautiful crescent. It becomes narrower and sharper as it\r\napproaches inferior conjunction, until it resembles a curved luminous\r\nthread prior to its disappearance at the conjunction. After having\r\npassed this point it reappears on the other side of the Sun as the\r\nmorning star.\r\n\r\nIt would be only natural to imagine that this peerless orb, the most\r\nbeautiful and lustrous of the planets, upon which men have gazed with\r\nlonging admiration, and designated the emblem of 'all beauty and all\r\nlove,' should have impressed Milton's poetical imagination with its\r\ncharming appearance, and stimulated the flow of his captivating muse. He\r\naddresses the orb as\r\n\r\n    Fairest of Stars, last in the train of night,\r\n    If better thou belong not to the dawn,\r\n    Sure pledge of day, that crown'st the smiling morn\r\n    With thy bright circlet, praise Him in thy sphere\r\n    While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.--v. 166-70.\r\n\r\nIn these lines the poet alludes to Venus as the morning star.\r\n\r\nIn the other passages in his poem Milton associates the planet sometimes\r\nwith the morning and at other times with the evening--\r\n\r\n    His countenance, as the Morning Star that guides\r\n    The starry flock.--v. 708-709.\r\n\r\n    Or if the Star of Evening and the Moon\r\n    Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring\r\n    Silence, and Sleep listening to thee will watch.--vii. 104-106.\r\n\r\n    And hence the morning planet gilds her horns.--vii. 366.\r\n\r\n    The Sun was sunk and after him the Star\r\n    Of Hesperus, whose office is to bring\r\n    Twilight upon the Earth, short arbiter\r\n    Twixt day and night.--ix. 47-50.\r\n\r\n                      and bid haste the Evening Star\r\n    On his hill top to light the bridal lamp.--viii. 519-20.\r\n\r\nMilton knew of the phases of Venus and was aware that at certain times\r\nthe planet was visible in the telescope as a beautiful crescent. The\r\nline in which he mentions her as gilding her horns is an allusion to\r\nthis appearance of Venus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLEIADES\r\n\r\nThe beautiful cluster of the Pleiades or Seven Sisters has been regarded\r\nwith hallowed veneration from time immemorial. The happy influences\r\nbelieved to be shed down upon the Earth by those stars and their close\r\nassociation with human destinies have rendered them objects of almost\r\nsacred interest among the different races of mankind. In every region of\r\nthe globe and in every clime, among civilised nations and savage\r\nfetish-worshipping tribes, the same benign influences were ascribed to\r\nthe stars which form this interesting group.\r\n\r\nIn Greek mythology they were known as the seven daughters of Atlas and\r\nPleione. Different versions are given of their fate. By some writers it\r\nis said they died from grief in consequence of the death of their\r\nsisters, the Hyades, or on account of the fate of their father, who,\r\nfor treason, was condemned by Zeus to bear on his head and hands the\r\nvault of heaven, on the mountains of north-west Africa which bear his\r\nname. According to others they were the companions of Diana, and, in\r\norder to escape from Orion, by whom they were pursued, the gods\r\ntranslated them to the sky.\r\n\r\nAll writers agree in saying that after their death or translation they\r\nwere transformed into stars. Their names are Alcyone, Electra, Maia,\r\nMerope, Sterope, Taygeta, and Celaeno. The seventh Atlantid is said to\r\nbe the 'lost Pleiad,' but it can be perceived without difficulty by a\r\nperson possessing good eyesight. In the book of Job there is a beautiful\r\nallusion to the Pleiades (chap. xxxviii.) when God speaks out of the\r\nwhirlwind and asks the patriarch to answer Him--\r\n\r\n    Canst thou bind the sweet influences of the Pleiades, or loose the\r\n        bands of Orion?\r\n    Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide\r\n        Arcturus with his sons?\r\n    Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion\r\n        thereof in the earth?\r\n\r\nAdmiral Smyth says that this noble passage is more correctly rendered as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Canst thou bind the delightful teemings of Cheemah?\r\n    Or the contractions of Chesil canst thou open?\r\n    Canst thou draw forth Mazzaroth in his season\r\n    Or Ayeesh and his sons canst thou guide?\r\n\r\nHe writes: 'In this very early description of the cardinal\r\nconstellations, _Cheemah_ denotes Taurus with the Pleiades; _Chesil_ is\r\nScorpio; Mazzaroth is Sirius in \"the chambers of the south;\" and Ayeesh\r\nthe Greater Bear, the Hebrew word signifying a _bier_, which was shaped\r\nby the four well-known bright stars, while the three forming the tail\r\nwere considered as children attending a funeral.' The Greeks at an early\r\nperiod were attracted by this cluster of stars, and Hesiod alludes to\r\nthem in his writings. One passage converted into rhyme reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    There is a time when forty days they lie,\r\n    And forty nights, conceal'd from human eye;\r\n    But in the course of the revolving year,\r\n    When the swain sharps the scythe, again appear.\r\n\r\nTheir heliacal rising was considered a favourable time for setting out\r\non a voyage, and their midnight culmination, which occurred shortly\r\nafter the middle of November, was celebrated by some nations with\r\nfestivals and public ceremonies. Considerable diversity of opinion\r\nexisted among the ancients with regard to the number of stars which\r\nconstitute this group. It was affirmed by some that only six were\r\nvisible, whilst others maintained that seven could be seen. Ovid writes:\r\n\r\n    Quae septem dici, sex tamen esse solent.\r\n\r\nHomer and Attalus mention six; Hipparchus and Aratus seven. The legend\r\nwith regard to the lost Pleiad would seem to indicate that, during a\r\nperiod in the past, the star possessed a superior brilliancy and was\r\nmore distinctly visible than it is at the present time. This may have\r\nbeen so, for, should it belong to the class of variable stars, there\r\nwould be a periodic ebb and flow of its light, by which its fluctuating\r\nbrilliance could be explained. When looked at directly only six stars\r\ncan be seen in the group, but should the eye be turned sideways more\r\nthan this number become visible. Several observers have counted as many\r\nas ten or twelve, and it is stated by Kepler that his tutor, Maestlin,\r\nwas able to enumerate fourteen stars and mapped eleven in their relative\r\npositions. With telescopic aid the number is largely increased--Galileo\r\nobserved thirty-six with his instrument and Hooke, in 1664, counted\r\nseventy-eight. Large modern telescopes bring into view several thousand\r\nstars in this region.\r\n\r\nThe Pleiades are situated at a profound distance in space. Their light\r\nperiod is estimated at 250 years, indicating a distance of 1,500\r\nbillions of miles. Our Sun if thus far removed would be reduced to a\r\ntenth-magnitude star. 'There can be little doubt,' says Miss Agnes\r\nClerke, 'that the solar brilliancy is surpassed by sixty to seventy of\r\nthe Pleiades. And it must be in some cases enormously surpassed; by\r\nAlcyone 1,000, by Electra 480, by Maia nearly 400 times. Sirius itself\r\ntakes a subordinate rank when compared with the five most brilliant\r\nmembers of a group, the real magnificence of which we can thus in some\r\ndegree apprehend.' This is the only star cluster which can be perceived\r\nto be moving in space, or which has an ascertained common proper motion.\r\nIts constituents form a magnificent system in which the stars bear a\r\nmutual relationship to each other, and perform intricate internal\r\nrevolutions, whilst they in systemic union drift along through the\r\ndepths of space. There are two allusions to the Pleiades in 'Paradise\r\nLost.' In describing the path of the newly created Sun, Milton\r\nintroduces them as indicative of the joyfulness associated with the\r\nbirth of the Universe--\r\n\r\n    First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,\r\n    Regent of day, and all the horizon round\r\n    Invested with bright rays, jocund to run\r\n    His longitude through heaven's high road; the grey\r\n    Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danced,\r\n    Shedding sweet influence.--vii. 370-75.\r\n\r\nIt was believed that the Earth was created in the spring; and towards\r\nthe end of April this group rises a little before the Sun and precedes\r\nhim in his course, 'shedding sweet influences.' The ancients believed\r\nthat the good or evil influences of the stars were exercised not in the\r\nnight but during the day, when their rays mingled with those of the Sun.\r\nThe pernicious influence of the Dog-star is mentioned by Latin writers\r\nas being most pronounced during the dog-days, at the end of summer and\r\ncommencement of autumn, the time of the heliacal rising of this star.\r\n\r\nThe other allusion to the Pleiades is in Book X., line 673, where\r\nMilton, in describing the altered path of the Sun consequent upon the\r\nFall, mentions how the orb travels through Taurus with the Seven\r\nAtlantic Sisters--the seven daughters of Atlas, the Pleiades, which are\r\nsituated on the shoulder of the animal representing this zodiacal\r\nconstellation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GALAXY\r\n\r\nThe Galaxy or Milky Way is the great luminous zone encircling the\r\nheavens, which can be seen extending across the sky from horizon to\r\nhorizon. Its diffused nebulous appearance caused the ancients much\r\nperplexity, and many quaint opinions were hazarded as to the nature of\r\nthis celestial highway; but the mystery associated with it was not\r\nsolved until Galileo directed his newly invented telescope to this\r\nlucent object, when, to his intense delight, he discovered that it\r\nconsists of myriads of stars--millions upon millions of suns so distant\r\nas to be individually indistinguishable to ordinary vision, and so\r\nclosely aggregated, that their blended light gives rise to the milky\r\nluminosity signified by its name. This stelliferous zone almost\r\ncompletely encircles the sphere, which it divides into two nearly equal\r\nparts, and is inclined at an angle of 63 deg. to the celestial equator. In\r\nCentaurus it divides into two portions, one indistinct and of\r\ninterrupted continuity, the other bright and well defined; these, after\r\nremaining apart for 120 deg., reunite in Cygnus. The Milky Way is of\r\nirregular outline and varies in breadth from 5 deg. to 16 deg.; it intersects\r\nthe equinoctial in the constellations Monoceros and Aquila, and\r\napproaches in Cassiopeia to within 27 deg. of the north pole of the heavens;\r\nan equal distance intervenes between it and the south pole. Its poles\r\nare in Coma Bernices and Cetus. The stars in the galactic tract are very\r\nunevenly distributed; in some of its richest regions as many stars as\r\nare visible to the naked eye on a clear night have been counted within\r\nthe space of a square degree. In other parts they are much less\r\nnumerous, and there have been observed besides, adjacent to the most\r\nluminous portions of the zone, dark intervals and winding channels\r\nalmost entirely devoid of stars. An instance of this kind occurs in the\r\nconstellation of the Southern Cross, where there exists in a rich\r\nstellar region a large oval-shaped dark vacuity, 8 deg. by 5 deg. in extent,\r\nthat appears to be almost entirely denuded of stars. In looking at it,\r\nan impression is created that one is gazing into an empty void of space\r\nfar beyond the Milky Way. This gulf of Cimmerian darkness was called by\r\nearly navigators the Coal Sack. Similar dark spaces, though not of such\r\nmagnitude, are seen in Ophiuchus, Scorpio, and Cygnus.\r\n\r\nThe Galaxy, when viewed with a powerful telescope, is found to consist\r\nof congeries of stars, vast stellar aggregations, great luminous tracts\r\nresolvable into clouds of stars of overpowering magnificence, superb\r\nclusters of various orders, and convoluted nebulous streams wandering\r\n'with mazy error' among 'islands of light and lakes of darkness,'\r\nresolved by the telescope into banks of shining worlds. The concourses\r\nof stars which enter into the formation of this wonderful zone exhibit\r\nin a marvellous degree the amazing profusion in which these orbs exist\r\nin certain regions of space; yet those multitudes of stars perform their\r\nmotions in harmonious unison and in orderly array, and by their mutual\r\nattraction sustain the dynamical equilibrium of this stupendous galactic\r\nring, the diameter of which, according to one authority, is not\r\ntraversed by light in less than 13,000 years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--A Portion of the Milky Way.]\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel, to whom we are indebted for most of what we know\r\nof the Milky Way, commenced a series of observations in 1785 with the\r\nobject of acquiring a knowledge of the structure of the sidereal\r\nheavens. In the accomplishment of this object, to which he devoted a\r\nconsiderable part of his life, he undertook a systematic survey of that\r\nportion of the Galaxy which is visible in the Northern Hemisphere. By a\r\nmethod called star-gauging, which consisted in the enumeration of the\r\nstars in each successive telescopic field as the instrument moved slowly\r\nover the region under observation, he found that the depth of the star\r\nstrata could be approximately ascertained by counting the stars along\r\nthe line of vision; those were most numerous where the visual line\r\nappeared of the greatest length and fewest in number where it was\r\nshortest. Herschel perceived the internal structure of the Galaxy to be\r\nexceedingly intricate and complex, and that it embraced within its\r\nconfines an endless variety of systems, clusters, and groups, branches,\r\nsprays, arches, loops, and streaming filaments of stars, all of which\r\ncombined to form this luminous zone. 'It is indeed,' says a well-known\r\nastronomer, 'only to the most careless glance, or when viewed through an\r\natmosphere of imperfect transparency, that the Milky Way seems a\r\ncontinuous zone. Let the naked eye rest thoughtfully on any part of it,\r\nand, if circumstances be favourable, it will stand out rather as an\r\naccumulation of patches and streams of light of every conceivable\r\nvariety of form and brightness, now side by side, now heaped on each\r\nother; again spanning across dark spaces, intertwining and forming a\r\nmost curious and complex network; and at other times darting off into\r\nthe neighbouring skies in branches of capricious length and shape which\r\ngradually thin away and disappear.' Sir John Herschel, who was occupied\r\nfor four years at the Cape of Good Hope in exploring the celestial\r\nregions of the Southern Hemisphere, describes the coming on of the Milky\r\nWay as seen in his 20-foot reflector. He first remarks 'that all the\r\nstars visible to us, whether by unassisted vision or through the best\r\ntelescopes, belong to and form part of a vast stratum or considerably\r\nflattened and unsymmetrical congeries of stars in which our system is\r\ndeeply and eccentrically plunged; and, moreover, situated near a point\r\nwhere the stratum bifurcates or spreads itself out into two sheets.' 'As\r\nthe main body of the Milky Way comes on the frequency and variety of\r\nthose masses (nebulous) increases; here the Milky Way is composed of\r\nseparate or slight or strongly connected clouds of semi-nebulous light,\r\nand, as the telescope moves, the appearance is that of clouds passing in\r\na scud, as sailors call it.' The Milky Way is like sand, not strewed\r\nevenly as with a sieve, but as if flung down by handfuls (and both hands\r\nat once), leaving dark intervals, and all consisting of stars of the\r\nfourteenth, sixteenth, twentieth magnitudes down to nebulosity, in a\r\nmost astonishing manner. After an interval of comparative poverty, the\r\nsame phenomenon, and even more remarkable, I cannot say it is nebulous,\r\nit is all resolved, but the stars are inconceivably numerous and minute;\r\nthere must be millions and all almost equally massed together. Yet they\r\nnowhere run to nuclei or clusters much brighter in the middle. Towards\r\nthe end of the seventeenth hour (Right Ascension) the globular clusters\r\nbegin to come in; they consist of stars of excessive minuteness, but\r\nyet not more so than the ground of the Milky Way, on which not only they\r\nappear projected, but of which it is very probable they form a part.\r\n'From the foregoing analysis of the telescopic aspect of the Milky Way\r\nin this interesting region, I think it can hardly be doubted that it\r\nconsists of portions differing exceedingly in distance, but brought by\r\nthe effect of projection into the same, or nearly the same, visual line;\r\nin particular, that at the anterior edge of what we have called the main\r\nstream, we see foreshortened a vast and illimitable area scattered over\r\nwith discontinuous masses and aggregates of stars in the manner of the\r\ncumuli of a mackerel sky, rather than of a stratum of regular thickness\r\nand homogeneous formation.'\r\n\r\nThe profound distance at which the stars of the Galaxy are situated in\r\nspace precludes the possibility of our obtaining any definite knowledge\r\nof their magnitude and of the extent of the intervals by which they are\r\nseparated from each other, nor can we learn anything of the details\r\nassociated with the systems and combinations into which they enter. It\r\nis believed that the majority of the stars in the Milky Way equal or\r\nsurpass the Sun in brilliancy and splendour. They are tenth to fifteenth\r\nmagnitude stars; now, the Sun at the distance indicated by these\r\nmagnitudes would in the telescope appear a much fainter object; he would\r\nnot reach the fifteenth magnitude. Consequently, the galactic stars are\r\nregarded as his peers or superiors in magnitude and brilliancy. Those\r\nmyriads of suns are all in motion--in nature a stationary body is\r\nunknown--and they are sufficiently far apart so as not to be unduly\r\ninfluenced by their mutual gravitational attraction; a distance perhaps\r\nequal to that which separates our Sun from the nearest fixed star may\r\nintervene between each of those orbs. In the deepest recesses of the\r\nMilky Way, Sir William Herschel was able to count 500 stars receding in\r\nregular order behind each other; between each there existed an interval\r\nof space, probably not less extensive than the interstellar spaces among\r\nthe stars by which we are surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe richest galactic regions in the Northern Hemisphere are found in\r\nPerseus, Cygnus, and Aquila. Night after night could be spent in\r\nsweeping the telescope over fields where the stars can be seen in\r\namazing profusion. In the interval of a quarter of an hour, Sir William\r\nHerschel observed 116,000 stars pass before him in the telescope, and on\r\nanother occasion he perceived 258,000 stars in the space of forty-one\r\nminutes. In the constellation of the Swan there is a region about 5 deg. in\r\nbreadth which contains 331,000 stars. Photography reveals in a\r\nremarkable manner the amazing richness of this stelliferous zone; the\r\nimpress of the stars on the sensitive plate of the camera, in some\r\ninstances, resembles a shower of descending snowflakes.\r\n\r\nThough Sir William Herschel was able to fathom the Galaxy in most of its\r\ntracts, yet there were regions which his great telescopes were unable\r\nto penetrate entirely through. In Cepheus there is a spot where he\r\nobserved the stars become 'gradually less till they escape the eye so\r\nthat appearances here favour the idea of a succeeding more distant\r\nclustering part.' He perceived another in Scorpio 'where, through the\r\nhollows and deep recesses of its complicated structure, we behold what\r\nhas all the appearance of a wide and indefinitely prolonged area strewed\r\nover with discontinuous masses and clouds of stars which the telescope\r\nat length refuses to analyse.' The Great Cluster in Perseus, which lies\r\nin the Milky Way, also baffled the penetrative capacity of Herschel's\r\ninstruments. We cannot help quoting Professor Nichol's description of\r\nHerschel's observation of this remarkable object. He says: 'In the Milky\r\nWay, thronged all over with splendours, there is one portion not\r\nunnoticed by the general observer, the spot in the sword-hand of\r\nPerseus. That spot shows no stars to the naked eye; the milky light\r\nwhich glorifies it comes from regions to which unaided we cannot pierce.\r\nBut to a telescope of considerable power the space appears lighted up\r\nwith unnumbered orbs; and these pass on through the depths of the\r\ninfinite, until, even to that penetrating glass, they escape all\r\nscrutiny, withdrawing into regions unvisited by its power. Shall we\r\nadventure into these deeper retirements? Then, assume an instrument of\r\nhigher efficacy, and lo! the change is only repeated; those scarce\r\nobserved before appear as large orbs, and, behind, a new series begins,\r\nshading gradually away, leading towards farther mysteries! The\r\nillustrious Herschel penetrated on one occasion into this spot, until he\r\nfound himself among depths whose light could not have reached him in\r\nmuch less than 4,000 years; no marvel that he withdrew from the pursuit,\r\nconceiving that such abysses must be endless!' The Milky Way may be\r\nregarded as a universe by itself, and our Sun as one of its myriad\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nMilton was aware of the stellar constitution of the Milky Way, which was\r\none of Galileo's discoveries. The poet gives a singularly accurate\r\ndescription of this luminous path, which he glorifies as the way by\r\nwhich the Deity returned up to the Heaven of Heavens after He finished\r\nHis great work of creation--\r\n\r\n                                          So sung\r\n    The glorious train ascending: He through Heaven,\r\n    That opened wide her blazing portals, led\r\n    To God's eternal house direct the way--\r\n    A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold,\r\n    And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear\r\n    Seen in the Galaxy, that Milky Way\r\n    Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest\r\n    Powdered with stars.--vii. 573-81.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMETS\r\n\r\nRecords of the appearance of these remarkable objects have been handed\r\ndown from earliest times; and when one of those mysterious visitors,\r\ntravelling from out the depths of space, became visible in our skies, it\r\nwas regarded with apprehension and dread as betokening the occurrence\r\nof calamities and direful events among the nations of the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe word comet is derived from the Greek {kome}, signifying\r\n'hair,' to which the hazy, luminous appearance of those objects bears\r\nsome resemblance. A comet consists of a bright central part called the\r\n_nucleus_; this is surrounded by layers of nebulous matter called the\r\n_coma_, and both combined form the _head_, from which a long appendage\r\nextends called the _tail_. The nucleus and tail are not essential parts\r\nof a comet, for many have been observed in which both have been wanting.\r\nThe tail is frequently very conspicuous, and presents considerable\r\ndiversity both as regards its appearance and length. In some comets it\r\nis entirely absent, and in others it has been observed to stretch over\r\nan arc of sixty or seventy degrees, indicating a length of 100 to 150\r\nmillion miles. Sometimes it is straight, and at other times it is curved\r\nat the extremity; it has been observed bifurcated into two branches;\r\nand, on rare occasions, comets have been seen with two or more tails.\r\nThe tail of a comet is always directed away from the Sun; it increases\r\nin size as the comet approaches the orb, and diminishes as it recedes\r\nfrom him. This depends upon the degree of heat to which the comet is\r\nexposed, which has the effect of driving off or evaporating some of the\r\nmatter composing the head. During the time the comet is travelling round\r\nthe Sun there is a continuous emission of this highly attenuated matter,\r\nwhich is visible as the tail, but when the comet begins to recede from\r\nthe orb and reaches cooler regions of space the tail diminishes in size\r\nas the temperature becomes reduced, and ultimately it disappears.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a comet in the sky is often sudden and unexpected, and\r\none of those erratic wanderers may become visible at any time and in any\r\npart of the heavens. It was remarked by Kepler that there are as many\r\ncomets in the sky as there are fishes in the ocean. This may or may not\r\nbe true, for they only become visible when they approach the Sun, and\r\nthe time during which they remain so does not usually exceed a few weeks\r\nor months. Ancient astronomers were much perplexed with the motions of\r\ncomets, which appeared to be much more irregular than those of other\r\ncelestial bodies and unconformed to any known laws. Tycho Brahe believed\r\nthat comets moved in circular orbits, and Kepler imagined that they\r\ntravelled in straight lines outwards from the Sun. Newton, however, was\r\nable to demonstrate that any conic section can be described about the\r\nSun consistent with the law of gravitation, and that the orbits of\r\ncomets correspond with three of the four sections into which a cone can\r\nbe divided. Consequently, they obey the laws of planetary motion. Comets\r\nwhich move in ellipses of known eccentricity and return with periodical\r\nregularity may be regarded as belonging to the solar system. Twenty of\r\nthese are known, and eleven of them have more than once passed their\r\nperihelion. Those most familiarly known complete their periods in years\r\nas follows:--Encke's 3.3; Swift's, 5.5; Winnecke's, 5.6; Tempel's, 6;\r\nBrorsen's, 5.5; Faye's, 7.4; Tuttle's, 13.8, and Halley's, 76. Comets\r\nwith parabolic and hyperbolic orbits may be regarded as stray objects\r\nwhich visit our system once, and depart never to return again. Besides\r\nthose already mentioned there are many comets with orbits of such marked\r\neccentricity that their ellipses when near perihelion cannot be\r\ndistinguished from parabolae. The great comets of 1780, 1811, 1843, 1858,\r\n1861, and 1882 traverse orbits approaching this form, and some of them\r\nrequire hundreds and thousands of years to accomplish a circuit of their\r\npaths.\r\n\r\nNumerous instances of the appearance of remarkable comets have been\r\nrecorded in the annals of ancient nations. The earliest records of\r\ncomets are by the Chinese, who were careful observers of celestial\r\nphenomena. A comet is said to have appeared at the time of the birth of\r\nMithridates (134 B.C.), which had a disc as large as that of the Sun; a\r\ngreat comet also became visible in the heavens about the time of the\r\ndeath of Julius Caesar (44 B.C.), and another was seen in the reign of\r\nJustinian (531 A.D.). A remarkable comet was observed in 1106, and in\r\n1456, the year in which the Turks obtained possession of Constantinople\r\nand threatened to overrun Europe, a great comet appeared, which was\r\nregarded by Christendom with ominous forebodings. The celebrated\r\nastronomer Halley was the first to predict the return of a comet.\r\nHaving become acquainted with Newton's investigations, which showed that\r\nthe forms of the orbits of comets were either parabolae or extremely\r\nelongated ellipses, he subjected the next great comet, which appeared in\r\n1682, to a series of observations, calculated its orbit, and predicted\r\nthat it would return to perihelion in seventy-five or seventy-six years.\r\nOn referring to past records he discovered that a great comet appeared\r\nin 1607, which pursued a path similar to the one traced out for his\r\ncomet, another was seen in 1531, and one in 1456. Halley perceived that\r\nthe intervals between those dates corresponded to a period of about\r\nseventy-six years, the time which he calculated would be required for\r\nhis comet to complete a revolution of its orbit. He therefore had no\r\nhesitation in predicting that the comet would appear again in 1758.\r\nHalley knew that he would not be alive to witness the event, and alludes\r\nto it in the following sentence: 'Wherefore if it should return\r\naccording to our prediction about the year 1758, impartial posterity\r\nwill not refuse to acknowledge that this was first discovered by an\r\nEnglishman.' As the time approached when the comet should be drawing\r\nnear to our system, much interest was excited among astronomers, who\r\nwould have an opportunity afforded them of testing the accuracy of\r\nHalley's prediction. An eminent French mathematician named Clairaut\r\ncomputed anew, by a method rather different to that adopted by Halley,\r\nthe retarding effect of the attraction of the planets upon the speed of\r\nthe comet, and arrived at the conclusion that it would reach perihelion\r\nabout the middle of April 1759; but, owing to unknown influences--Uranus\r\nand Neptune not having been discovered--it might be a month before or\r\nbehind the calculated time. Clairaut made this announcement on November\r\n14, 1758. Astronomers were now intently on the look-out for the comet,\r\nand night after night the sky was swept by telescopes in search of the\r\nexpected visitor, which for upwards of seventy years had been pursuing\r\nits solitary path invisible to mortal eyes. But the mental vision of the\r\nmathematician did not fail to follow this celestial object, which was\r\nnow announced as being on the confines of our system. The comet was\r\nfirst observed on December 25, 1758, it soon became conspicuous in the\r\nheavens, and reached perihelion on March 12, 1759, a month before the\r\ntime assigned to it by Clairaut but within the limit of error allowed\r\nfor unknown influences. Halley's comet returned again in 1835, and may\r\nbe expected about the year 1911. The periodic appearance of this comet\r\nhas been traced back to the year 1305.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated comet of 1680 was noted as having been the one which\r\nafforded Newton an opportunity of making observations which led to his\r\ndiscovery that comets describe orbits round the Sun in conformity with\r\nthe different sections of a cone. The comet of 1811 was observed for\r\nmany weeks in the northern heavens as a brilliant object with a\r\nbeautiful fan-shaped tail; it completes a revolution of its orbit in\r\nabout 3,000 years. The comet of 1843 was also a splendid object. It\r\npossessed a tail 200 million miles in length, and approached within\r\n32,000 miles of the Sun. The heat to which it was exposed was sufficient\r\nto volatilize the most infusible substances known to exist. Donati's\r\ncomet of 1858 will be long remembered as one of the most impressive of\r\ncelestial spectacles: its tail extended over an area of forty degrees,\r\nand enveloped the star Arcturus, which could be seen shining through it\r\nwith undiminished brilliancy. Its period is estimated to be 2,100 years.\r\nA great comet appeared in 1861, through the tail of which the Earth\r\npassed without any perceptible effect having resulted. No remarkable\r\ncomets have appeared during recent years. In 1880, 1881, and 1882,\r\nseveral were observed, and that of 1881 was the first successfully\r\nphotographed.\r\n\r\nComets consist of cosmical matter which exists in a condition of extreme\r\ntenuity, and especially so in the coma and tail. Sir John Herschel\r\ndescribed them as almost spiritual in texture, and small stars have been\r\nseen shining through their densest parts without any perceptible\r\ndiminution of their light. The nucleus is believed to be composed of a\r\ncongeries of meteoric fragments, and these, when exposed to the Sun's\r\nheat, throw off luminous nebulous particles that are swept by some\r\nrepulsive force into space and form the appendage known as the tail.\r\nComets may be regarded as celestial objects that are perfectly\r\ninnocuous. Neither fear nor dread need be apprehended from their visits;\r\nthey come to please and instruct, not to injure or destroy.\r\n\r\nMilton does not fail to introduce into his poem several allusions to\r\ncomets, and in doing so expresses the ideas and sentiments which in his\r\ntime were associated with those objects.\r\n\r\nIn describing the hostile meeting between Satan and Death before the\r\nGates of Hell, he writes:\r\n\r\n                            On the other side,\r\n    Incensed with indignation, Satan stood\r\n    Unterrified, and like a comet burned,\r\n    That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge\r\n    In the arctic sky, and from his horrid hair\r\n    Shakes pestilence and war.--ii. 706-11.\r\n\r\nThis passage is eminently descriptive of the appearance of a great\r\ncomet, and the occasion on which it is introduced adds to the intensity\r\nof the lurid imaginings and feelings of terror and dismay with which\r\nthese objects have always been regarded. The comparison of the enraged\r\nPrince of Hell with one of those mysterious and fiery looking visitors\r\nto our skies was a grand conception of the poet's, and one worthy of the\r\nmighty combatant. Ophiuchus (the Serpent-bearer) is a large\r\nconstellation which occupies a rather barren region of the heavens to\r\nthe south of Hercules. It has a length of about forty degrees, and is\r\nrepresented by the figure of a man bearing a serpent in both hands. It\r\nis not easy to imagine why Milton should have assigned the comet to\r\nthis uninteresting constellation; he may possibly have seen one in this\r\npart of the sky, or his poetical ear may have perceived that the\r\nexpression 'Ophiuchus huge,' which has about it a ponderous rhythm, was\r\nwell adapted for the poetic description of a comet.\r\n\r\nThe only other allusion in the poem to a comet is near its conclusion,\r\nwhen the Cherubim descend to take possession of the Garden, prior to the\r\nremoval of Adam and Eve--\r\n\r\n                              High in front advanced,\r\n    The brandished sword of God before them blazed,\r\n    Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,\r\n    And vapour as the Lybian air adust\r\n    Began to parch that temperate clime.--xii. 632-36.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALLING STARS\r\n\r\nOn any clear night an observer can, by attentively watching the heavens,\r\nperceive a few of those objects which become visible for a moment as a\r\nstreak of light and then vanish. They are the result of the combustion\r\nof small meteoric masses having a celestial origin, and travelling with\r\ncosmical velocity, and which, in their headlong flight, become so heated\r\nby contact with the Earth's atmosphere that they are converted into\r\nglowing vapour. This vapour when it cools condenses into fine powder or\r\ndust, and gradually descends upon the Earth's surface, where it can be\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nShooting stars become visible at a height varying between twenty and one\r\nhundred and thirty miles, and their average velocity has been estimated\r\nat about thirty miles a second. Though casual falling stars can be seen\r\nat all times in every part of the heavens, yet there are certain periods\r\nat which they appear in large numbers, and have been observed to radiate\r\nfrom certain well-defined parts of the sky. When the radiant point is\r\noverhead, the falling stars spread out and resemble a parachute of fire;\r\nbut when it is below the horizon, the stars ascend upwards like rockets\r\ninto the sky. The radiant point is fixed among the stars, so that at the\r\ncommencement of a shower it may be overhead, and before the termination\r\nof the display it may have travelled below the horizon. The radiant is\r\nusually named after the constellation in which it is observed.\r\n\r\nThe November meteors are called Leonids, because they radiate from a\r\npoint in the constellation Leo; those in Taurus are called Taurids; in\r\nPerseus, Perseids; in Lyra, Lyraids; and in Andromeda, Andromedes,\r\nbecause their radiant points are situated in those constellations.\r\n\r\nThe falling stars that have attracted most attention are those which\r\nappear on or about November 13. Every year at this period they can be\r\nseen in greater or less numbers, and on referring to numerous past\r\nrecords it has been ascertained that a magnificent display of those\r\nobjects occurs every thirty-three years. The earliest historical\r\nallusion to this meteoric shower is by Theophanes, who wrote that in the\r\nyear 472 A.D. the sky at Constantinople appeared to be on fire with\r\nfalling stars. In the year 902 A.D. another remarkable display took\r\nplace, and from that time until 1833 twelve conspicuous displays are\r\nrecorded as having occurred at recurring intervals of thirty-three\r\nyears. The grandest display of this kind that was ever witnessed\r\noccurred in 1833. It was visible over nearly the whole of the American\r\ncontinent, and, having commenced at midnight, lasted for four or five\r\nhours. The falling stars were so numerous that they appeared to rain\r\nupon the Earth, and caused the utmost consternation and terror among\r\nthose who witnessed the phenomenon, many persons having imagined that\r\nthe end of the world was at hand. The regular recurrence of these\r\nmeteoric displays has been satisfactorily explained by the assumption\r\nthat round the Sun there travels in an elliptical orbit with planetary\r\nvelocity a vast shoal of meteoric bodies some millions of miles in\r\nlength and several hundred thousand miles in breadth. The nearest point\r\nof their orbit to the Sun coincides with the Earth's orbit, and the most\r\ndistant part extends beyond the orbit of Uranus. These bodies accomplish\r\na circuit of their orbit in 33-1/4 years. The Earth in her annual\r\nrevolution intersects the path of the meteors, and when this occurs some\r\nfalling stars can always be seen; but when the intersection happens at\r\nthe time the shoal is passing, then there results a grand meteoric\r\ndisplay. Numerous other meteoric swarms travel in orbital paths round\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\nMilton, in his poem, alludes to falling stars upon two occasions. In\r\ndescribing the fall of Mulciber from Heaven he says:--\r\n\r\n                                      from morn\r\n    To noon he fell, from noon to dewy eve,\r\n    A summer's day; and with the setting sun\r\n    Dropt from the zenith like a falling star,\r\n    On Lemnos the AEgaean isle.--i. 742-46.\r\n\r\nThe rapid flight of the archangel Uriel from the Sun to the Earth is\r\ndescribed in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n    Thither came Uriel, gliding through the even\r\n    On a sunbeam, swift as a shooting star\r\n    In autumn thwarts the night, when vapours fired\r\n    Impress the air, and shows the mariner\r\n    From what point of his compass to beware\r\n    Impetuous winds.--iv. 555-60.\r\n\r\nMilton mentions the season of the year in which those stars are most\r\nfrequently seen, and refers to an ancient belief by which they were\r\nregarded as the precursors of stormy weather. A translation from Virgil\r\ncontains a similar allusion to them--\r\n\r\n    Oft shalt thou see ere brooding storms arise,\r\n    Star after star glide headlong down the skies.\r\n\r\nThe standard borne by the Cherub Azazel is described as having--\r\n\r\n    Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind.--i. 537.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMILTON'S IMAGINATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE ASTRONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theme chosen by Milton for his great epic, viz. the Fall of Man and\r\nhis expulsion from Paradise--perhaps the most momentous incident in the\r\nhistory of the human race--was one worthy of the genius of a great poet\r\nand in the treatment of which Milton has been sublimely successful. The\r\nnewly created Earth; the untainted loveliness of the Paradise in which\r\nour first parents dwelt during their innocence; their temptation; their\r\nfall and removal from the happy garden, furnished a theme which afforded\r\nhim an opportunity for the display of his unrivalled poetic genius.\r\n\r\nThough the chief interest in the poem is centred in the Garden of Eden\r\nand its occupants, yet Milton was enabled, by the comprehensive manner\r\nin which he treated his subject, to introduce into his work a cosmology\r\nwhich embraced not only the system to which our globe belongs, but the\r\nentire starry heavens by which we are surrounded. But the universality\r\nof his genius did not rest here. In the utterance of his sacred song he\r\nsoared beyond the starry sphere, describing himself as wrapt above the\r\npole--the starry pole--up to the Empyrean, or Heaven of Heavens, the\r\nineffable abode of the Deity and the blissful habitation of angelic\r\nbeings who, in adoration and worship, surround the throne of the Most\r\nHigh.\r\n\r\nDescending to that nether world at the opposite pole of the universe, in\r\nthe lowest depth of Chaos, the place prepared by Eternal Justice for the\r\nrebellious, he unfolds to our horror-stricken gaze the terrors of this\r\ninfernal region; its fiery deluge of ever-burning sulphur; its 'regions\r\nof sorrow;' its 'doleful shades'--the unhappy abode of fallen angels who\r\n'in floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,' alternated by exposure\r\nto unendurable cold and icy torment, experience the direful consequences\r\nof their apostacy.\r\n\r\nMilton's 'Paradise Lost' may be regarded as the loftiest intellectual\r\neffort in the whole range of literature. In it we find all that was\r\nknown of science, philosophy, and theology. The theme, founded upon a\r\nBible narrative, itself written under divine inspiration, embraces the\r\nentire system of Christian doctrine as revealed in the Scriptures, and\r\nmany of the noblest passages in the sacred volume are introduced into\r\nthe poem expressed in the lofty utterance of flowing and harmonious\r\nverse. The choicest classical writings of Greek and Latin authors; the\r\nmythological and traditional beliefs of ancient nations; historical\r\nincidents of valour and renown and all that was great and good in the\r\nannals of mankind were laid under contribution by Milton in the\r\nillustration and embellishment of his poem.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a basis or foundation upon which to construct his\r\ngreat epic, Milton found it necessary to localise the regions of space\r\nin which the principal events mentioned in his poem are described as\r\nhaving occurred. The unfathomable abyss of space may be regarded as an\r\nuncircumscribed sphere boundless on all sides round, and so far as we\r\ncan comprehend of infinite extent. This sphere Milton divided into two\r\nhemispheres--an upper and a lower. The upper was called Heaven, or the\r\nEmpyrean--a glorified region of boundless dimensions; the lower\r\nhemisphere embraced Chaos--a dark, fathomless abyss in which the\r\nelements of matter existed in a state of perpetual tumult and wild\r\nuproar. The occurrence of a rebellion in Heaven necessitated a further\r\ndivision of the sphere. The revolt, headed by Lucifer, one of the\r\nhighest archangels, afterwards known as Satan, who drew after him a\r\nthird of the angelic host, contested the supremacy of Heaven with\r\nMichael and the angels which kept their loyalty. After two days'\r\nbattle--\r\n\r\n                        Him the Almighty Power\r\n    Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky,\r\n    With hideous ruin and combustion, down\r\n    To bottomless perdition; there to dwell\r\n    In adamantine chains and penal fire.--i. 44-48.\r\n\r\nHaving been precipitated over the crystal wall of Heaven into the deep\r\nabyss, Milton says:--\r\n\r\n    Nine days they fell; confounded Chaos roared,\r\n    And felt tenfold confusion in their fall\r\n    Through his wild Anarchy; so huge a rout\r\n    Encumbered him with ruin. Hell at last,\r\n    Yawning, received them whole, and on them closed.--vi. 871-75.\r\n\r\nHell, Milton locates in the lowest depth of Chaos, a region cut off from\r\nthe body of Chaos, through which the expelled angels fell for nine days\r\nbefore reaching their destined habitation. There are now three divisions\r\nof space: HEAVEN, CHAOS, and HELL. But a fourth is required to enable\r\nMilton to complete his scheme for the delineation of his poem. The Earth\r\nand starry universe were not as yet called into existence, but after the\r\noverthrow of the rebellious angels, God, by circumscribing a portion of\r\nChaos situated immediately underneath the Empyrean, created the Mundane\r\nUniverse, or the 'Heavens and the Earth.'[15] This new universe He\r\nreclaimed from Chaos, and with the embryo elements of matter--\r\n\r\n    His dark materials to create new worlds.--ii. 916.\r\n\r\nHe formed the Earth and all the countless shining orbs visible overhead,\r\nand the myriads more which the telescope reveals, scattered in\r\napparently endless profusion over the circular immensity of space. It is\r\nthis new universe--the Earth and Starry Heavens--that claims our chief\r\nattention, and in the delineation of Milton's imaginative and\r\ndescriptive powers it is to this latest manifestation of Divine wisdom\r\nand might that our remarks shall principally apply. After the expulsion\r\nof the rebel angels from Heaven, God sent His Son, the Messiah to create\r\nthe new universe--a work of omnipotence described by Milton in a manner\r\nworthy of so magnificent a display of almighty power--\r\n\r\n                                Meanwhile the Son\r\n    On his great expedition now appeared,\r\n    Girt with omnipotence, with radiance crowned\r\n    Of majesty divine: sapience and love\r\n    Immense; and all his Father in Him shone.\r\n    About his chariot numberless were poured\r\n    Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,\r\n    And Virtues, winged Spirits, and chariots winged\r\n    From the armoury of God, where stand of old\r\n    Myriads, between two brazen mountains lodged\r\n    Against a solemn day, harnessed at hand,\r\n    Celestial equipage; and now came forth\r\n    Spontaneous, for within them Spirit lived,\r\n    Attendant on their Lord. Heaven opened wide\r\n    Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound!\r\n    On golden hinges moving, to let forth\r\n    The King of Glory, in his powerful Word\r\n    And Spirit, coming to create new worlds.\r\n    On Heavenly ground they stood, and from the shore\r\n    They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss\r\n    Outrageous as a sea, dark, wasteful, wild,\r\n    Up from the bottom turned by furious winds\r\n    And surging waves, as mountains to assault\r\n    Heaven's highth, and with the centre mix the pole.\r\n    'Silence, ye troubled Waves, and thou Deep, peace!'\r\n    Said then the omnific Word: 'your discord end!'\r\n    Nor stayed; but on the wings of Cherubim\r\n    Uplifted, in paternal glory rode\r\n    Far into Chaos, and the World unborn;\r\n    For Chaos heard his voice. Him all his train\r\n    Followed in bright procession, to behold\r\n    Creation, and the wonders of his might.\r\n    Then stayed the fervid wheels, and in his hand\r\n    He took the golden compasses, prepared\r\n    In God's eternal store, to circumscribe\r\n    This Universe, and all created things.\r\n    One foot he centred, and the other turned\r\n    Round through the vast profundity obscure;\r\n    And said, 'Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds;\r\n    This be thy just circumference, O World!'\r\n    Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,\r\n    Matter unformed and void. Darkness profound\r\n    Covered the abyss; but on the watery calm\r\n    His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,\r\n    And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth,\r\n    Throughout the fluid mass; but downward purged\r\n    The black, tartareous, cold, infernal dregs,\r\n    Adverse to life; then founded, then conglobed\r\n    Like things to like; the rest to several place\r\n    Disparted, and between spun out the Air;\r\n    And Earth self balanced on her centre hung.--vii. 192-242.\r\n\r\nMilton begins his narrative of the Creation by describing the progress\r\nof the Deity on His great expedition, accompanied by hosts of angels and\r\nsurrounded with all the solemn pomp and splendour of Heaven. The\r\nbrilliant throng having passed through Heaven's gates, which opened wide\r\ntheir portals, they beheld in front of them the dark abyss of Chaos--a\r\ntempest-tossed sea of warring elements upturned in wild confusion. At\r\nGod's instant command silence and peace reigned over the deep, and\r\ntranquil calm succeeded noisy discord. Then on the wings of Cherubim He\r\nrode far into Chaos, and with His golden compasses decreed the\r\ndimensions of the universe by circumscribing the vast vacuity of space.\r\nInto the elements which hasted to their several places, His Spirit\r\ninfused vital warmth and caused the formless mass of matter to assume\r\nthe figure of a sphere, and thus the Earth poised on her axis\r\nunsupported, and in darkness shrouded hung suspended in space. The\r\nplacing of the golden compasses in the hands of the Creator, with which\r\nHe measured out the heavens, is a noble conception on the part of\r\nMilton, and one most appropriate, since the construction of the universe\r\nis based upon the principles of geometrical science.\r\n\r\n    'Let there be Light!' said God; and forthwith Light\r\n    Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,\r\n    Sprung from the Deep; and from her native east\r\n    To journey through the aery gloom began,\r\n    Sphered in a radiant cloud; for yet the Sun\r\n    Was not; she in a cloudy tabernacle\r\n    Sojourned the while. God saw the light was good;\r\n    And light from darkness by the hemisphere\r\n    Divided; light the day, and darkness night\r\n    He named. Thus was the first day even and morn:\r\n    Nor passed uncelebrated, nor unsung\r\n    By the celestial quires, when orient light\r\n    Exhaling first from darkness they beheld;\r\n    Birthday of Heaven and Earth; with joy and shout\r\n    The hollow universal orb they filled,\r\n    And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised\r\n    God and his works: Creator Him they sung,\r\n    Both when first evening was, and when first morn.--vii. 243-60.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Light, which sprung into existence at the fiat of the\r\nCreator, was the next great event witnessed by beholding\r\nangels--birthday of Heaven and Earth, first morning and first evening,\r\nwhich the celestial choirs celebrated with praise and shouts of joy.\r\nThe creation of the firmament was the great work of the second day.\r\n\r\n    Again God said, 'Let there be firmament\r\n    Amid the waters, and let it divide\r\n    The waters from the waters!' And God made\r\n    The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,\r\n    Transparent, elemental air, diffused\r\n    In circuit to the uttermost convex\r\n    Of this great round--partition firm and sure,\r\n    The waters underneath from those above\r\n    Dividing; for as the Earth, so He the World\r\n    Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide\r\n    Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule\r\n    Of Chaos far removed, lest fierce extremes\r\n    Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:\r\n    And Heaven he named the Firmament. So even\r\n    And morning chorus sung the second day.--vii. 261-275.\r\n\r\nAfter describing the gathering of the waters off the face of the globe\r\ninto seas, causing the dry land to appear, which at the word of God\r\nbecame clothed with vegetation, rendering the Earth a habitable abode,\r\nMilton proceeds to describe the creation of the heavenly bodies--\r\n\r\n    Again the Almighty spake: 'Let there be Lights\r\n    High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide\r\n    The day from night; and let them be for signs,\r\n    For seasons, and for days, and circling years;\r\n    And let them be for lights, as I ordain\r\n    Their office in the firmament of Heaven,\r\n    To give light on the Earth!' and it was so.\r\n    And God made two great Lights, great for their use\r\n    To Man, the greater to have rule by day,\r\n    The less by night, altern; and made the Stars,\r\n    And set them in the firmament of Heaven\r\n    To illuminate the Earth, and rule the day\r\n    In their vicissitude, and rule the night,\r\n    And light from darkness to divide. God saw,\r\n    Surveying his great work, that it was good:\r\n    For, of celestial bodies, first, the Sun,\r\n    A mighty sphere He framed, unlightsome first,\r\n    Though of ethereal mould; then formed the Moon\r\n    Globose, and every magnitude of Stars,\r\n    And sowed with stars the Heaven thick as a field.\r\n    Of light by far the greater part he took,\r\n    Transplanted from her cloudy shrine, and placed\r\n    In the Sun's orb, made porous to receive\r\n    And drink the liquid light; firm to retain\r\n    Her gathered beams, great palace now of Light.\r\n    Hither, as to their fountain, other stars\r\n    Repairing, in their golden urns draw light,\r\n    And hence the morning planet gilds her horns;\r\n    By tincture or reflection they augment\r\n    Their small peculiar, though, from human sight\r\n    So far remote, with diminution seen.\r\n    First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,\r\n    Regent of day, and all the horizon round\r\n    Invested with bright rays, jocund to run\r\n    His longitude through Heaven's high road; the grey\r\n    Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danced,\r\n    Shedding sweet influence. Less bright the Moon,\r\n    But opposite in levelled west was set\r\n    His mirror, with full face borrowing her light\r\n    From him; for other light she needed none\r\n    In that aspect, and still that distance keeps\r\n    Till night; then in the east her turn she shines,\r\n    Revolved on Heaven's great axle, and her reign\r\n    With thousand lesser lights dividual holds,\r\n    With thousand thousand stars that then appeared\r\n    Spangling the hemisphere. Then first adorned\r\n    With their bright luminaries, that set and rose,\r\n    Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day.--vii. 339-86.\r\n\r\nThe first creation was Light, and Milton, according to Scriptural\r\ntestimony, ascribes its origin to the bidding of the Creator. 'God said,\r\nLet there be light; and there was light!' The Sun he describes as a\r\nmighty sphere, but at first non-luminous. There was light, but no sun.\r\nThe reason usually given in explanation of this phenomenon is, that the\r\nheavenly bodies were created at the same time as the Earth, but were\r\nrendered invisible by a canopy of vapour and cloud which enveloped the\r\nnewly-formed globe; and that afterwards, when it dispersed, they\r\nappeared in the firmament, shining in all their pristine splendour.\r\nMilton does not, however, adhere to this view of things, but says that\r\nlight for the first three days sojourned in a cloudy shrine or\r\ntabernacle, and was afterwards transplanted in the Sun, which became a\r\ngreat palace of light.\r\n\r\nHe expresses himself in a somewhat similar manner in Book III., which\r\nopens with an address to Light--one of the most beautiful passages in\r\nthe poem, in which he alludes to his blindness when expressing his\r\nthoughts and sentiments with regard to this ethereal medium, which\r\nconveys to us the pleasurable sensation of vision--\r\n\r\n    Hail, holy Light! offspring of Heaven first-born!\r\n    Or of the Eternal co-eternal beam,\r\n    May I express thee unblamed? since God is light,\r\n    And never but in unapproached light\r\n    Dwelt from eternity--dwelt then in thee,\r\n    Bright effluence of bright essence increate!\r\n    Or hear'st thou rather, pure Ethereal stream,\r\n    Whose fountain who shall tell? Before the Sun,\r\n    Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice\r\n    Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest\r\n    The rising world of waters dark and deep,\r\n    Won from the void and formless Infinite.--iii. 1-12.\r\n\r\nThe Sun having become a lucent orb, Milton poetically describes how the\r\nplanets repair to him as to a fountain, and in their golden urns draw\r\nlight; and how the morning planet Venus gilds her horns illumined by his\r\nrays. The poet associates joyous ideas with the new-born universe. The\r\nSun, now the glorious regent of day, begins his journey in the east,\r\nlighting up the horizon with his beams; whilst before him danced the\r\ngrey dawn, and the Pleiades shedding sweet influences. There existed an\r\nancient belief that the Earth was created in the spring, and in April\r\nthe Sun is in the zodiacal constellation Taurus, in which are also\r\nsituated the Pleiades; they rise a little before the orb, and precede\r\nhim in his path through the heavens. The stars of this group have always\r\nbeen regarded with a peculiar sacredness, and their rays, mingling with\r\nthose of the Sun, were believed to shed sweet influences upon the Earth.\r\nThe Moon, less bright, with borrowed light, in her turn shines in the\r\neast, and, with the thousand thousand luminaries that spangle the\r\nfirmament, reigns over the night.\r\n\r\nWe learn in Book III. that the archangel Uriel, who was beguiled by\r\nSatan, witnessed the Creation, and described how the heavenly bodies\r\nwere brought into existence, he having perceived what we should call the\r\ngaseous elements of matter rolled into whorls and vortices which became\r\ncondensed into suns and systems of worlds. This mighty angel says:--\r\n\r\n    I saw when, at his word the formless mass,\r\n    This World's material mould, came to a heap:\r\n    Confusion heard his voice, and wild Uproar\r\n    Stood ruled, stood vast Infinitude confined;\r\n    Till at his second bidding darkness fled,\r\n    Light shone, and order from disorder sprung.\r\n    Swift to their several quarters hasted then\r\n    The cumbrous elements, Earth, Flood, Air, Fire;\r\n    And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven\r\n    Flew upward, spirited with various forms,\r\n    That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars\r\n    Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;\r\n    Each had his place appointed, each his course;\r\n    The rest in circuit walls this Universe.--iii. 708-21.\r\n\r\nIn his sublime description of the Creation Milton has adhered with\r\nmarked fidelity to the Mosaic version, as narrated in the first two\r\nchapters of Genesis, when God, by specific acts in certain stated\r\nperiods of time, created the visible universe and all that it contains.\r\n\r\nThe successive acts of creation are described in words almost identical\r\nwith those of Scripture, embellished and adorned with all the wealth of\r\nexpression which our language is capable of affording. The several\r\nscenes presented to the imagination, and witnessed by hosts of admiring\r\nangels as each portion of the magnificent work was accomplished, are\r\nfull of a grandeur and majesty worthy of the loftiest conceivable effort\r\nof Divine power and might.\r\n\r\nThe return of the Creator after the completion of His great work is\r\ndescribed by Milton in a manner worthy of the progress of Deity through\r\nthe celestial regions. The whole creation rang with jubilant delight,\r\nand the bright throng which witnessed the wonders of His might followed\r\nHim with acclamation, ascending by the glorified path of the Milky Way\r\nup to His high abode--the Heaven of Heavens--\r\n\r\n    Here finished He, and all that He had made\r\n    Viewed, and behold! all was entirely good.\r\n    So even and morn accomplished the sixth day:\r\n    Yet not till the Creator from his work\r\n    Desisting, though unwearied, up returned,\r\n    Up to the Heaven of Heavens, His high abode,\r\n    Thence to behold this new created World,\r\n    The addition of his empire, how it showed\r\n    In prospect from His throne, how good, how fair,\r\n    Answering his great idea. Up He rode,\r\n    Followed with acclamation, and the sound\r\n    Symphonious of ten thousand harps, that tuned\r\n    Angelic harmonies: The Earth, the Air\r\n    Resounded (thou remember'st, for thou heard'st)\r\n    The Heavens and all the constellations rung,\r\n    The planets in their stations listening stood,\r\n    While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.\r\n    'Open ye everlasting gates!' they sung;\r\n    'Open ye Heavens! your living doors; let in\r\n    The great Creator, from his work returned\r\n    Magnificent, his six days' work, a World;\r\n    Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deign\r\n    To visit oft the dwellings of just men,\r\n    Delighted; and with frequent intercourse\r\n    Thither will send his winged messengers\r\n    On errands of supernal grace.' So sung\r\n    The glorious train ascending: He through Heaven,\r\n    That opened wide her blazing portals, led\r\n    To God's eternal house direct the way--\r\n    A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold,\r\n    And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear\r\n    Seen in the Galaxy, that Milky Way\r\n    Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest\r\n    Powdered with stars.--vii. 548-81.\r\n\r\nMilton, throughout his description of the Creation, sustains with lofty\r\neloquence his sublime conception of this latest display of almighty\r\npower; and invests with becoming majesty all the acts of the Creator,\r\nwho, when He finished His great work, saw that all was entirely good.\r\n\r\nShortly after the creation of the new universe, Satan, having escaped\r\nfrom Hell, plunged into the abyss of Chaos, and, after a long and\r\narduous journey upwards, in which he had to fight his way through the\r\nsurging elements that raged around him like a tempestuous sea, he\r\nreached the upper confines of this region where less confusion\r\nprevailed, and where a glimmering dawn of light penetrated its darkness\r\nand gloom, indicating that the limit of the empire of Chaos and ancient\r\nNight had been reached by the adventurous fiend. Pursuing his way with\r\ngreater ease, he leisurely beholds the sight which is opening to his\r\neyes--a sight rendered more glorious by his long sojourn in darkness. He\r\nsees:--\r\n\r\n    Far off the empyreal Heaven, extended wide\r\n    In circuit, undetermined square or round,\r\n    With opal towers and battlements adorned\r\n    Of living sapphire, once his native seat,\r\n    And, fast by, hanging in a golden chain,\r\n    This pendent World, in bigness as a star\r\n    Of smallest magnitude close by the Moon.--ii. 1047-53.\r\n\r\nHe gazes upon his native Heaven where once he dwelt, and observes the\r\npendent world in quest of which he journeyed hither--hung by a golden\r\nchain from the Empyrean and no larger than a star of the smallest\r\nmagnitude when close by the Moon. In this passage Milton does not allude\r\nto the Earth, which was invisible, but to the entire starry heavens--the\r\nnewly created universe reclaimed from Chaos, which, when contrasted with\r\nthe Empyrean, appeared in size no larger than the minutest star when\r\ncompared with the full moon. Pursuing his journey, the new universe as\r\nit is approached expands into a globe of vast dimensions; its convex\r\nsurface--round which the chaotic elements in stormy aspect\r\nlowered--seemed a boundless continent, dark, desolate, and starless,\r\nexcept on the side next to the wall of Heaven, which though far-distant\r\nafforded it some illumination by its reflected light. Satan, having\r\nalighted on this convex shell which enclosed the universe, wandered long\r\nover its bleak and dismal surface, until his attention was attracted by\r\na gleam of light which appeared through an opening at its zenith right\r\nunderneath the Empyrean. Thither he directed his steps, and perceived a\r\nstructure resembling a staircase, or ladder, which formed the only means\r\nof communication between Heaven and the new creation, and upon which\r\nangels descended and ascended--\r\n\r\n                        Far distant he descries,\r\n    Ascending by degrees magnificent\r\n    Up to the wall of Heaven, a structure high;\r\n    At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared\r\n    The work as of a kingly palace gate,\r\n    With frontispiece of diamond and gold\r\n    Embellished; thick with sparkling orient gems\r\n    The portal shone, inimitable on Earth\r\n    By model, or by shading pencil drawn.\r\n    The stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw\r\n    Angels ascending and descending, bands\r\n    Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled\r\n    To Padan Aram, in the field of Luz\r\n    Dreaming by night under the open sky,\r\n    And waking cried, '_This is the gate of Heaven._'--iii. 501-15.\r\n\r\nSometimes this mysterious structure was drawn up to Heaven and\r\ninvisible. At the time that Satan reached the opening, the stairs were\r\nlowered, and standing at their base he looked down with wonder upon the\r\nentire starry universe--\r\n\r\n    Such wonder seized, though after Heaven seen,\r\n    The Spirit malign, but much more envy seized,\r\n    At sight of all this World beheld so fair,\r\n    Round he surveys (and well might, where he stood\r\n    So high above the circling canopy\r\n    Of night's extended shade) from eastern point\r\n    Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears\r\n    Andromeda far off Atlantic seas\r\n    Beyond the horizon; then from pole to pole\r\n    He views in breadth, and without longer pause,\r\n    Down right into the World's first region throws\r\n    His flight precipitant, and winds with ease\r\n    Through the pure marble air his oblique way\r\n    Amongst innumerable stars, that shone\r\n    Stars distant, but nigh hand seemed other worlds,\r\n    Or other worlds they seemed, or happy isles,\r\n    Like those Hesperian Gardens famed of old,\r\n    Fortunate fields, and groves, and flowery vales;\r\n    Thrice happy isles! But who dwelt happy there\r\n    He staid not to inquire: above them all\r\n    The golden Sun, in splendour likest Heaven\r\n    Allured his eye: thither his course he bends\r\n    Through the calm firmament, (but up or down\r\n    By centre or eccentric hard to tell\r\n    Or longitude) where the great luminary,\r\n    Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,\r\n    That from his lordly eye keep distance due,\r\n    Dispenses light from far. They, as they move\r\n    Their starry dance in numbers that compute\r\n    Days, months, and years, towards his all-cheering lamp\r\n    Turn swift their various motions, or are turned\r\n    By his magnetic beam, that gently warms\r\n    The Universe, and to each inward part\r\n    With gentle penetration, though unseen,\r\n    Shoots invisible virtue even to the Deep;\r\n    So wondrously was set his station bright.--iii. 552-87.\r\n\r\nThe Ptolemaic cosmology having been adopted by Milton in the elaboration\r\nof his poem, he describes the universe in conformity with the doctrines\r\nassociated with this form of astronomical belief. To each of the first\r\nseven spheres which revolved round the steadfast Earth there was\r\nattached a heavenly body; the eighth sphere embraced all the fixed\r\nstars, a countless multitude; the ninth the crystalline; and enclosing\r\nall the other spheres as if in a shell was the tenth sphere, or Primum\r\nMobile, which in its diurnal revolution carried round with it all the\r\nother spheres. The nine inner spheres were transparent, but the tenth\r\nwas an opaque solid shell-like structure, which enclosed the new\r\nuniverse and constituted the boundary between it and Chaos underneath\r\nand the Empyrean above. It was on the surface of this sphere that Satan\r\nwandered until he discovered the opening at its zenith, where, by means\r\nof a staircase or ladder, communication was maintained with the\r\nEmpyrean. Standing on the lower steps of this structure he paused for a\r\nmoment to look down into the glorious universe which lay beneath him--\r\n\r\n                                  another Heaven\r\n    From Heaven-gate not far, founded in view\r\n    On the clear hyaline the glassy sea.--vii. 617-19.\r\n\r\nHe beholds it in all its dimensions, from pole to pole, and\r\nlongitudinally from Libra to Aries, then without hesitation precipitates\r\nhimself down into the world's first region, and winds his way with ease\r\namong the fixed stars. Around him he sees innumerable shining worlds,\r\nsparkling and glittering in endless profusion over the circumscribed\r\nimmensity of space--mighty constellations that shone from afar;\r\nclustering aggregations of stars; floating islands of light; twinkling\r\nsystems rising out of depths still more profound, and a zone luminous\r\nwith the light of myriads of lucid orbs verging on the confines of the\r\nuniverse. All these worlds the fiend passed unheeded, nor stayed he to\r\ninquire who dwelt happy there. In splendour above them all the Sun\r\nattracted his attention and, directing his course towards the great\r\nluminary of our system, he alights on the surface of the orb.\r\n\r\nMilton now makes a digression in order to describe what Satan observed\r\nin the Sun after having landed there. The poet embraces an opportunity\r\nfor exercising his imaginative and descriptive powers by giving an ideal\r\ndescription of what, judging from the appearance of the orb, might be\r\nthe natural condition of things existing on his surface--\r\n\r\n    There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps\r\n    Astronomer in the Sun's lucent orb\r\n    Through his glazed optic tube, yet never saw.\r\n    The place he found beyond expression bright,\r\n    Compared with aught on Earth, metal or stone;\r\n    Not all parts like, but all alike informed\r\n    With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire;\r\n    If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear;\r\n    If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,\r\n    Ruby or topaz, to the twelve that shone\r\n    In Aaron's breastplate, and a stone besides,\r\n    Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen;\r\n    That stone, or like to that, which here below\r\n    Philosophers in vain so long have sought,\r\n    In vain, though by their powerful art they bind\r\n    Volatile Hermes, and call up unbound\r\n    In various shapes old Proteus from the sea,\r\n    Drained through a limbec to his native form.\r\n    What wonder then if fields and regions here\r\n    Breathe forth elixir pure, and rivers run\r\n    Potable gold, when, with one virtuous touch,\r\n    The arch-chemic Sun, so far from us remote,\r\n    Produces, with terrestrial humour mixed,\r\n    Here in the dark so many precious things\r\n    Of colour glorious, and effect so rare?\r\n    Here matter new to gaze the Devil met\r\n    Undazzled; far and wide his eye commands;\r\n    For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,\r\n    But all sunshine, as when his beams at noon\r\n    Culminate from the equator, as they now\r\n    Shot upward still direct, whence no way round\r\n    Shadow from body opaque can fall; and the air,\r\n    Nowhere so clear sharpened his visual ray\r\n    To objects distant far, whereby he soon\r\n    Saw within here a glorious Angel stand.--iii. 588-622.\r\n\r\nThe physical structure of the interior of the Sun is unknown; all that\r\nwe see of the orb is the photosphere--the dazzling luminous envelope\r\nwhich indicates to the eye the boundary of the solar disc, and which is\r\nthe source of light and heat. Milton, in his imaginative and beautifully\r\npoetical description of the Sun, is not more fanciful in his conception\r\nof the nature of the refulgent orb than a renowned astronomer (Sir\r\nWilliam Herschel) who writes in the following strain: 'A cool, dark,\r\nsolid globe, its surface diversified with mountains and valleys, clothed\r\nin luxuriant vegetation and richly stored with inhabitants, protected by\r\na heavy cloud-canopy from the intolerable glare of the upper luminous\r\nregion, where the dazzling coruscations of a solar aurora some thousands\r\nof miles in depth evolved the stores of light and heat which vivify our\r\nworld.' Satan, disguised as a cherub, makes himself known to Uriel,\r\nRegent of the Sun. The upright Seraph in response to his request directs\r\nhim to the Earth, the abode of Man--\r\n\r\n    Look downward on that Globe, whose hither side\r\n    With light from hence, though but reflected, shines,\r\n    That place is Earth, the seat of Man; that light\r\n    His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,\r\n    Night would invade; but there neighbouring Moon\r\n    (So call that opposite fair star) her aid\r\n    Timely interposes, and her monthly round\r\n    Still ending, still renewing, through mid-Heaven,\r\n    With borrowed light her countenance triform\r\n    Hence fills and empties, to enlighten the Earth,\r\n    And in her pale dominion checks the night.--iii. 722-32.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible not to feel impressed with the accuracy and\r\ncomprehensiveness of Milton's astronomical knowledge; and how he has\r\nunited in charming poetic expression the dry details of science with the\r\ndivine inspiration of the heavenly muse. The distinctive appearances of\r\nthe Sun, Moon, planets, and stars; their functional importance as\r\nregards this terrestrial sphere; the splendour and lustre peculiar to\r\neach; and the glory displayed in the entire created heavens, are\r\nportrayed with a skill indicative of a masterly knowledge of the science\r\nof astronomy.\r\n\r\n    Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name\r\n    If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine\r\n    Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,\r\n    Above the flight of Pegasean wing!\r\n    The meaning, not the name, I call; for thou\r\n    Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top\r\n    Of old Olympus dwell'st; but heavenly-born,\r\n    Before the hills appeared or fountain flowed,\r\n    Thou with Eternal Wisdom didst converse,\r\n    Wisdom thy sister, and with her didst play\r\n    In presence of the Almighty Father, pleased\r\n    With thy celestial song. Up led by thee,\r\n    Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed,\r\n    An earthly guest, and drawn empyreal air,\r\n    Thy tempering. With like safety guided down,\r\n    Return me to my native element;\r\n    Lest, from this flying steed unreined, (as once\r\n    Belerophon, though from a lower clime)\r\n    Dismounted, on the Aleian field I fall,\r\n    Erroneous there to wander, and forlorn.\r\n    Half yet remains unsung, but narrower bound\r\n    Within the visible diurnal sphere.\r\n    Standing on Earth, not rapt above the pole,\r\n    More safe I sing with mortal voice, unchanged\r\n    To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,\r\n    On evil days though fallen, and evil tongues,\r\n    In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,\r\n    And solitude; yet not alone, while thou\r\n    Visit'st my slumbers nightly, or when morn\r\n    Purples the east. Still govern thou my song,\r\n    Urania, and fit audience find though few.--vii. 1-32.\r\n\r\nThe Muses were Greek mythological divinities who possessed the power of\r\ninspiring song, and were the patrons of poets and musicians. According\r\nto Hesiod they were nine in number and presided over the arts. Urania\r\nwas the Goddess of Astronomy, and Calliope the Goddess of Epic Poetry.\r\nThey are described as the daughters of Zeus, and Homer alludes to them\r\nas the goddesses of song who dwelt on the summit of Mount Olympus. They\r\nwere the companions of Apollo, and accompanied with song his playing on\r\nthe lyre at the banquets of the Immortals. Milton does not invoke the\r\nmythological goddess, but Urania the Heavenly Muse, whose aid he also\r\nimplores at the commencement of his poem prior to his flight above the\r\nAonian Mount. Under her divine guidance he ascended to the Heaven of\r\nHeavens and breathed empyreal air, her tempering; in like manner he\r\nrequests her to lead him down to his native element lest he should meet\r\nwith a fate similar to what befell Bellerophon. Half his task he has\r\ncompleted, the other half, confined to narrower bounds within the\r\nvisible diurnal sphere, remains unsung, and in its fulfilment he still\r\nimplores his celestial patroness to govern his song.\r\n\r\nThe natural phenomena which occur as a consequence of the motions of the\r\nheavenly bodies and the diurnal rotation of the Earth on her axis, are\r\naccompanied by agreeable alternations in the aspect of nature with which\r\nevery one is familiar. The rosy footsteps of morn; the solar splendour\r\nof noonday; the fading hues of even; and night with her jewelled courts\r\nand streams of molten stars, have been sung with rapturous admiration by\r\npoets of every nation and in every age. They, as ardent lovers of\r\nnature, have described in choicest language the pleasing vicissitudes\r\nbrought about by the real and apparent motions of the celestial orbs.\r\n\r\nIn this respect Milton is unsurpassed by any poet in ancient or in\r\nmodern times. The occasions on which he describes the heavenly bodies,\r\nor alludes to them in association with other phenomena, testify to the\r\nfelicity of his thoughts and to the greatness of his poetic genius.\r\nSurely no poet has ever given us a lovelier description of evening, or\r\nhas added more to its exquisite beauty by his allusion to the celestial\r\norbs, than Milton when he describes the first evening in Paradise--\r\n\r\n    Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray\r\n    Had in her sober livery all things clad;\r\n    Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,\r\n    They to their grassy couch, these to their nests\r\n    Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale.\r\n    She all night long her amorous descant sung;\r\n    Silence was pleased. Now glowed the firmament\r\n    With living sapphires: Hesperus that led\r\n    The starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon,\r\n    Rising in clouded majesty, at length\r\n    Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,\r\n    And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw.--iv. 598-609.\r\n\r\nIn the avowal of her conjugal love, Eve, with charming expression,\r\nassociates the orbs of the firmament with the delightful appearances of\r\nnature which presented themselves to her observation after she awoke to\r\nthe consciousness of intelligent existence.\r\n\r\n    Sweet is the breath of Morn, her rising sweet,\r\n    With charm of earliest birds: pleasant the Sun,\r\n    When first on this delightful land he spreads\r\n    His orient beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flower,\r\n    Glistering with dew; fragrant the fertile Earth\r\n    After soft showers; and sweet the coming on\r\n    Of grateful Evening mild; then silent Night,\r\n    With this her solemn bird, and this fair Moon,\r\n    And these the gems of Heaven, her starry train:\r\n    But neither breath of Morn, when she ascends\r\n    With charm of earliest birds; nor rising Sun\r\n    On this delightful land; nor herb, fruit, flower,\r\n    Glistering with dew; nor fragrance after showers;\r\n    Nor grateful Evening mild; nor silent Night,\r\n    With this her solemn bird; nor walk by Moon,\r\n    Or glittering star-light, without thee is sweet.\r\n    But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom\r\n    This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes?--iv. 641-58.\r\n\r\nOne of the charms of Milton's verse is the devoutly poetical sentiment\r\nwhich pervades it. His thoughts, though serious, are not austere or\r\ngloomy, and it is in his loftiest musings that his reverence becomes\r\nmost apparent. This feeling is conspicuous in Adam's reply to the\r\ninquiry addressed to him by Eve--\r\n\r\n    Daughter of God and Man, accomplished Eve,\r\n    These have their course to finish round the Earth\r\n    By morrow evening, and from land to land\r\n    In order, though to nations yet unborn,\r\n    Ministering light prepared, they set and rise;\r\n    Lest total Darkness should by night regain\r\n    Her old possession, and extinguish life\r\n    In Nature and all things; which these soft fires\r\n    Not only enlighten, but with kindly heat\r\n    Of various influence foment and warm,\r\n    Temper or nourish, or in part shed down\r\n    Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow\r\n    On Earth, made hereby apter to receive\r\n    Perfection from the Sun's more potent ray.\r\n    These, then, though unbeheld in deep of night,\r\n    Shine not in vain; nor think, though men were none,\r\n    That Heaven would want spectators, God want praise:\r\n    Millions of spiritual creatures walk the Earth\r\n    Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:\r\n    All these with ceaseless praise his works behold\r\n    Both day and night. How often from the steep\r\n    Of echoing hill or thicket, have we heard\r\n    Celestial voices to the midnight air,\r\n    Sole, or responsive each to other's note\r\n    Singing their Great Creator! Oft in bands\r\n    While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk,\r\n    With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds\r\n    In full harmonic number joined, their songs\r\n    Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven.--iv. 660-88.\r\n\r\nThe Morning Hymn of Praise which Adam and Eve offer up in concert to\r\ntheir Maker contains their loftiest thoughts and most reverent\r\nsentiments, expressed in melodiously flowing verse. In their solemn\r\ninvocations they call upon the orbs of the firmament to join in\r\npraising and extolling the Creator, and in their devout enthusiasm and\r\nadoration address by name those that are most conspicuous. Hesperus,\r\n'fairest of stars,' is asked to praise Him in her sphere. The Sun, great\r\nimage of his Maker, is told to acknowledge Him his greater, and to sound\r\nHis praise in his eternal course. The Moon, the fixed stars, and the\r\nplanets are called upon to resound the praise of the Creator, whose\r\nglory is declared in the Heavens--\r\n\r\n    Fairest of Stars, last in the train of night,\r\n    If better thou belong not to the dawn,\r\n    Sure pledge of day, that crown'st the smiling morn\r\n    With thy bright circlet, praise Him in thy sphere\r\n    While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.\r\n    Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,\r\n    Acknowledge Him thy greater; sound his praise\r\n    In thy eternal course, both when thou climb'st,\r\n    And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fall'st.\r\n    Moon, that now meet'st the orient Sun, now fliest\r\n    With the fixed stars, fixed in their orb that flies;\r\n    And ye five other wandering Fires, that move\r\n    In mystic dance, not without song, resound\r\n    His praise, who out of darkness called up Light.--v. 166-79.\r\n\r\nMilton's conception of celestial distances, and of the vast regions of\r\ninterstellar space, is finely described in the following lines:--\r\n\r\n                        Down thither prone in flight\r\n    He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky\r\n    Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing\r\n    Now on the polar winds; then with quick fan\r\n    Winnows the buxom air, till, within soar\r\n    Of towering eagles.--v. 266-71.\r\n\r\nAs in their morning, so in their evening devotions, our first parents\r\nnever fail to introduce a reference to the celestial orbs as indicating\r\nthe power and goodness of the Creator, made manifest in the beauty and\r\ngreatness of His works--\r\n\r\n    Thus, at their shady lodge arrived, both stood,\r\n    Both turned, and under open sky adored\r\n    The God that made both Sky, Air, Earth and Heaven\r\n    Which they beheld; the Moon's resplendent globe,\r\n    And starry pole.--iv. 720-24.\r\n\r\nThe numerous extracts contained in this volume impress upon one's mind\r\nhow largely astronomy enters into the composition of 'Paradise Lost,'\r\nand of how much assistance the knowledge of this science was to Milton\r\nin the elaboration of his poem. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine how\r\nsuch a work could have been written except by a poet who possessed a\r\nproficient and comprehensive knowledge of astronomy. The chief\r\ncharacteristic of Milton's poetry is its sublimity, which is the natural\r\noutcome of the magnificence of his conceptions and of his own pure\r\nimaginative genius. Among all the fields of literature, science, and\r\nphilosophy explored by him, he found none more congenial to his tastes,\r\nor that afforded his imagination more freedom for its loftiest flights,\r\nthan the sublimest of sciences--astronomy. Whether we admire most the\r\naccuracy of his astronomical knowledge, or the wonderful creations of\r\nhis poetic fancy, or his beautiful descriptions of the celestial orbs,\r\nit is apparent that in this domain of science, as a poet, he stands\r\nalone and without a rival. In his choice of the Ptolemaic cosmology\r\nMilton adopted a system with which he had been familiar from his\r\nyouth--the same which his favourite poet Dante introduced into his poem,\r\n'The Divina Commedia,' and which was well adapted for poetic\r\ndescription. The picturesque conception of ten revolving spheres,\r\ncarrying along with them the orbs assigned to each, which, by their\r\nrevolution round the steadfast Earth, brought about with unfailing\r\nregularity the successive alternation of day and night, and in every\r\ntwenty-four hours exhibited the pleasing vicissitudes of dawn, of\r\nsunshine, of twilight, and of darkness, relieved by the soft effulgence\r\nof the nocturnal sky, afforded Milton a favourable basis upon which to\r\nconstruct a cosmical epic. The Copernican theory--with which he was\r\nequally conversant, and in the accuracy and truthfulness of which he\r\nbelieved--though less complicated than the Ptolemaic in its details, did\r\nnot possess the same attractiveness for poetic description that belonged\r\nto the older system. According to this theory there is, surrounding us\r\non all sides, a boundless uncircumscribed ocean of space, to which it is\r\nimpossible to assign any conceivable limit; in every effort to\r\ncomprehend its dimensions or fathom its depths, the mind recoils upon\r\nitself, baffled and discomfited, with a conscious feeling that there can\r\nbe no nearer approach to the end when end there is none that can be\r\nconceived of. Interspersed throughout the regions of this azure vast of\r\nspace is the stellar universe, which to our comprehension is as infinite\r\nas the abyss in which it exists. The solar system, though of magnificent\r\ndimensions, is but a unit in the astronomical whole, in which are\r\nembraced millions of other similar units--other solar systems, perhaps\r\ndiffering in construction from that of ours, with billions of miles of\r\ninterstellar space intervening between each; yet so vast are the\r\ndimensions of the celestial sphere that those distances when measured\r\nupon it sink into utter insignificance. As the receding depths of space\r\nare penetrated by powerful telescopes, they are found to be pervaded\r\nwith stars and starry archipelagoes, distributed in profusion over the\r\ncircular immensity and extending away into abysmal depths, beyond the\r\nreach of visibility by any optical means which we possess. To the\r\nuniverse there is no known end--nowhere in imagination can its boundary\r\nbe reached! This bewildering conception of the cosmos did not trouble\r\nthe minds of pre-Copernican thinkers. They regarded the steadfast Earth\r\nas the most important body in the universe; nor were the celestial orbs\r\nwhich circled round it believed to be very far distant. Tycho Brahe\r\nimagined that the stars were not much more remote than the planets.\r\nEpicurus thought the stars were small crystal mirrors in the sky which\r\nreflected the solar rays, and the Venerable Bede remarked that they\r\nneeded assistance from the Sun's light in order to render them more\r\nluminous.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of the Ptolemaic system by Milton afforded greater scope\r\nfor the exercise of his imaginative powers, and enabled him to bring\r\nwithin the mental grasp of his readers a conception of the universe\r\nwhich was not lost in the immensity associated with the Copernican view\r\nof things. Besides, it also furnished him with a distinctly defined\r\nbasis upon which to erect the superstructure of his poem. Above the\r\ncircumscribed universe was Heaven or the Empyrean; underneath it was\r\nChaos, from which it had been reclaimed, and in the lowest depth of\r\nwhich Milton located the infernal world called Hell. These four regions\r\nembraced universal space; and in the elaboration of his great epic\r\nMilton relied upon his imaginative genius, his brilliant scholarship,\r\nhis vast erudition, and the divine inspiration of the heavenly muse.\r\nWith these, aided by the power and vigour of his intellect, he was\r\nenabled to produce a cosmical epic that surpassed all previous efforts\r\nof a similar kind, and which still remains without a parallel.\r\n\r\nOne of the distinguishing features of Milton's mind was his wonderful\r\nimagination, and in its exercise he beheld those sublime celestial and\r\nterrestrial visions on which he reared fabrics of splendour and beauty,\r\ndescribed in harmonious numbers with the fervid eloquence and charm of a\r\ntrue poet. An example of the loftiness and originality of his\r\nimagination is afforded us in his description of the Creation, the main\r\nfacts of which he derived from the first two chapters of Genesis, and\r\nupon these he elaborated in full and striking detail his magnificent\r\nconception of the efforts of Divine Might, which in six successive\r\ncreative acts called into existence the universe and all that it\r\ncontains. The rising of the Earth out of Chaos; the creation of light\r\nand of the orbs of the firmament; the joyfulness associated with the\r\nonward career of the new-born Sun; the subdued illumination of the\r\nfull-orbed Moon, and the thousand thousand stars that spangle the\r\nnocturnal sky--all these afforded Milton a rich field in which his\r\nimagination luxuriated, and in the description of which he found\r\nsubject-matter worthy of his gifted intellect.\r\n\r\nMilton gives an ampler and more detailed description of the new universe\r\nin his narration of Satan's journey through space in search of this\r\nworld, and brings more vividly before the imagination of his readers the\r\nglories of the celestial regions. The fiend, having emerged from the\r\ndark abyss of Chaos into a region of light, first beheld the new\r\ncreation from such a distance that to his view it appeared as a star\r\nsuspended by a golden chain from the Empyrean. This stellar conception\r\nof the poet's harmonised with the views of the Ptolemaists, who believed\r\nthat the universe was of limited extent, and though its dimensions were\r\nvast beyond comprehension, it was, nevertheless, enclosed by the tenth\r\nsphere or Primum Mobile. It was on the surface of this sphere that Satan\r\nalighted, and over which he wandered, until attracted by a beam of light\r\nthat appeared through an opening at its zenith, where, by means of a\r\nstair or ladder, communication was maintained between the new universe\r\nand Heaven above. Hither the undaunted fiend hied, and, standing on the\r\nlower steps of this structure, momentarily paused to gaze upon the\r\nglorious sight which burst upon his view before directing his flight\r\ndown into the newly created universe. Milton then describes his progress\r\nthrough the stellar regions, his landing in the Sun and what he saw\r\nthere, and the termination of his journey when he descends from the\r\necliptic down to the Earth. In doing so the poet gives a wonderfully\r\nbeautiful description of the starry universe, of the Sun, Moon, and\r\nEarth (Book III. 540-742), enhanced and adorned with his own poetic\r\nimaginings derived from fable, philosophy, and science.\r\n\r\nMilton makes more frequent allusion to the Sun than to any of the other\r\norbs of the firmament. This we should expect: the poet always gives the\r\norb the precedence which is his due, and never fails, when the occasion\r\nrequires it, to surround him with the 'surpassing glory' which marks his\r\npre-eminence above all other occupants of the sky. The Moon, his\r\nconsort--peerless in the subdued effulgence of her borrowed light; the\r\nbeautiful star of evening, Hesperus; the sidereal heavens with their\r\nuntold glories; the Galaxy, overpowering in the magnificence of its\r\nclouds and streams of stars--all these have their beauties and charms\r\nmirrored in the pages of this remarkable poem.\r\n\r\nThat the observation of the celestial orbs, their phases, and the varied\r\nphenomena which occur as a consequence of their motions, were to Milton\r\nan unfailing source of enjoyment and of meditative delight, is evident\r\nfrom the frequency with which he alludes to them. The following lines\r\nalso testify to this:--\r\n\r\n    For wonderful indeed are all his works,\r\n    Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all\r\n    Had in remembrance always with delight!\r\n    But what created mind can comprehend\r\n    Their number, or the wisdom infinite\r\n    That brought them forth, but hid their causes deep?--iii. 703-708.\r\n\r\nIt is very pleasant, as Milton says, to\r\n\r\n                        sit and rightly spell\r\n    Of every star that heaven doth show.\r\n\r\nIt is also pleasant to know the astronomy of his 'Paradise Lost,' and to\r\nlinger over the delightful and harmonious utterances associated with the\r\nsublimest of sciences, expressed in the melodious language of England's\r\ngreatest epic poet.\r\n\r\n\r\n              PRINTED BY\r\nSPOTTISWOODE AND CO., NEW-STREET SQUARE\r\n                LONDON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Chambers's _Handbook of Astronomy_.\r\n\r\n[2] Brewster's _Martyrs of Science_.\r\n\r\n[3] The transit occurred on a Sunday, and the 'business of the highest\r\nimportance' to which Horrox alludes was his clerical duties.\r\n\r\n[4] A fresco by the late Mr. Ford Maddox-Brown, depicting Crabtree\r\nobserving the transit of Venus, adorns the interior of the Manchester\r\nTown Hall.\r\n\r\n[5] William Crabtree died on August 1, 1644, aged 34 years.\r\n\r\n[6] The constellation Virgo.\r\n\r\n[7] _Life of Galileo_ (Library of Useful Knowledge).\r\n\r\n[8] Miss Clerke's _System of the Stars_.\r\n\r\n[9] Miss Clerke's _System of the Stars_.\r\n\r\n[10] Miss Clerke's _System of the Stars_.\r\n\r\n[11] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[12] An expression in Book VIII. 148-49 would seem to indicate that this\r\nwas inaccurate, but the lines\r\n\r\n                          'and other suns perhaps\r\n    With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry,'\r\n\r\nare an allusion to the planets Jupiter and Saturn, whose satellites had\r\nbeen recently discovered.\r\n\r\n[13] Mr. E.
