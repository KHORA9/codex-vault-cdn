But for the\r\nviews and expressions contained herein, they alone are personally\r\nresponsible, and do not represent or speak for any interest whatever.\r\nFor many years the writers have collected data on the subject of pearls,\r\nand have accumulated all the obtainable literature, not only the easily\r\nprocurable books, but likewise manuscripts, copies of rare volumes,\r\noriginal edicts, and legislative enactments, thousands of newspaper\r\nclippings, and interesting illustrations, many of them unique, making\r\nprobably the largest single collection of data in existence on this\r\nparticular subject. It was deemed advisable to present the results of\r\nthese studies and observations in one harmonious volume, rather than in\r\ntwo different publications. This publication is not a pioneer in an\r\nuntrodden field. As may be seen from the appended bibliography, during\r\nthe last two thousand years hundreds of persons have discussed\r\npearls—mystically, historically, poetically, and learnedly. Among the\r\nolder writers who stand out with special prominence in their respective\r\nperiods are the encyclopedist Pliny, in the first century A.D.; Oviedo\r\nand Peter Martyr of the sixteenth century; the physician Anselmus De\r\nBoot, and that observant traveler and prince of jewelers, Tavernier, in\r\nthe seventeenth century. It would be difficult to do justice to the many\r\nwriters of the nineteenth century and of the present time; but probably\r\nmost attention has been attracted by the writings of Hessling and Möbius\r\nof Germany; Kelaart, Streeter, Herdman, and Hornell of Great Britain;\r\nFilippi of Italy, and Seurat and Dubois of France. While the book is a\r\njoint work in the sense that each writer has contributed material to all\r\nof the chapters and has critically examined and approved the entire\r\nwork, the senior author has more closely applied himself to the latter\r\nhalf of the text, covering antiquity values, commerce, wearing\r\nmanipulation, treatment, famous collections, aboriginal use, and the\r\nillustrations, while the junior author has attended to the earlier half\r\nof the book, with reference to history, origin, sources, fisheries,\r\nculture, mystical properties, and the literature of the pearl.\r\n\r\nThe senior author has had exceptionally favorable opportunities to\r\nexamine the precious objects contained in the various imperial and royal\r\ntreasuries. Through the courtesy of the late Count Sipuigine, Court\r\nChamberlain, and of the late General Philamanoff, custodian of the\r\nOurejena Palata, he was permitted to critically examine the Russian\r\ncrown jewels in the Summer Palace on the Neva, and in the Palata in the\r\nKremlin, at Moscow, he examined the crowns and jewels of all the early\r\nczars. Through the courtesy of Baron von Theile, he was permitted to\r\ninspect carefully and in detail the wonderful jewels of the Austrian\r\ncrown, which are beautifully ordered and arranged. The English and Saxon\r\ncrown jewels were also seen under favorable conditions which permitted\r\ndetailed examination, and the jewel collections of almost all the\r\nprincipal museums of Europe and America were carefully studied. As\r\nregards the literature of the subject, the senior author has gathered\r\ntogether the largest known existing collection of works treating of\r\npearls and precious stones.\r\n\r\nIn covering so comprehensive a subject, many obligations have been\r\nincurred from individuals and officials, to whose courtesy and\r\nassistance is due much of the interest of this work. To list all of\r\nthese is impossible, yet it would be ungrateful not to note the\r\nfollowing: her Majesty Queen Margherita of Italy; his Royal Highness the\r\nGaikwar of Baroda; to H. R.

Probably the\r\nmembers of some fish-eating tribe—maybe of the coast of India or\r\nbordering an Asiatic river—while opening mollusks for food, were\r\nattracted by their luster. And as man’s estimation of beauty developed,\r\nhe found in them the means of satisfying that fondness for personal\r\ndecoration so characteristic of half-naked savages, which has its\r\ncounterpart amid the wealth and fashion of the present day.\r\n\r\nPearls seem to be peculiarly suggestive of oriental luxury and\r\nmagnificence. It is in the East that they have been especially loved,\r\nenhancing the charms of Asiatic beauty and adding splendor to barbaric\r\ncourts celebrated for their display of costume. From their possession of\r\nthe rich pearl resources it is natural that the people of India and of\r\nPersia should have early found beauty and value in these jewels, and\r\nshould have been among the first to collect them in large quantities.\r\nAnd no oriental divinity, no object of veneration has been without this\r\nornament; no poetical production has lacked this symbol of purity and\r\nchastity.\r\n\r\nIn a personal memorandum, Dr. A. V. Williams Jackson, professor of\r\nIndo-Iranian languages in Columbia University, states that it is\r\ngenerally supposed that the Vedas, the oldest sacred books of the\r\nBrahmans, contain several allusions to pearl decorations a millennium or\r\nmore before the Christian era, as the word _krisana_ and its\r\nderivatives—which occur a half dozen times in the Rigveda, the oldest of\r\nthe Vedas—are generally translated as signifying “pearl.” Even if this\r\ninterpretation of the term be called into question on the ground that\r\nthe Hindus of the Panjab were not well acquainted with the sea, there\r\ncan be little or no doubt that the Atharvaveda, at least five hundred\r\nyears before the Christian era, alludes to an amulet made of pearls and\r\nused as a sort of talisman in a hymn[1] of magic formulas.\r\n\r\nThose two great epics of ancient India, the Ramayana and the\r\nMahabharata, refer to pearls. The Ramayana speaks of a necklace of\r\ntwenty-seven pearls, and has pearl drillers to accompany a great\r\nmilitary expedition.[2] An old myth recounts the offerings made by the\r\nelements as gifts worthy of the deity: the air offered the rainbow, the\r\nfire a meteor, the earth a ruby, and the sea a pearl. The rainbow formed\r\na halo about the god, the meteor served as a lamp, the ruby decorated\r\nthe forehead, and the pearl was worn upon the heart.\r\n\r\nThe literature of Hinduism frequently associates the pearl with Krishna,\r\nthe eighth avatar or incarnation of Vishnu, the most popular god of\r\nHindu worship. One legend credits its discovery to the adorable Krishna,\r\nwho drew it from the depths of the sea to adorn his daughter Pandaïa on\r\nher nuptial day. Another version makes the pearl a trophy of the victory\r\nof Krishna over the monster Pankagna, and it was used by the victor as a\r\ndecoration for his bride.\r\n\r\nIn the classic period of Sanskrit literature, about the first century of\r\nthe Christian era, there were abundant references to pearls, generally\r\ncalled _mukta_ (literally “the pure”); and there are dozens of words for\r\npearl necklaces, circlets, strings, and ornamental festoons,\r\nparticularly in the dramas of Kalidasa—the Hindu Shakspere, who lived\r\nabout the third century A.D.—and of his successors.\r\n\r\nIn the Mahavansa and the Dipavansa, the ancient chronicle histories of\r\nCeylon in the Pali language, are several early Cingalese records of\r\npearl production and estimation.[3] The Mahavansa lists pearls among the\r\nnative products sent from Ceylon about 550 B.C., King Wijayo sending his\r\nfather-in-law gifts of pearls and chanks to the value of two lacs of\r\nrupees; and notes that about 300 B.C., several varieties of Ceylon\r\npearls were carried as presents by an embassy to India.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ancient Chinese crown with pearls\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ancient Chinese pearl rosary\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Chinese priests keeping guard over the tombs of the kings, in Mukden,\r\n    where the crowns are preserved\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the ancient civilization of China, pearls were likewise esteemed;\r\nthis is evidenced by the frequent mention of them in traditional\r\nhistory, their employment in the veneration of idols, and as tribute by\r\nforeign princes to the emperor. One of the very earliest of books, the\r\nShu King (dating from about 2350–625 B.C.), notes that, in the\r\ntwenty-third century B.C., Yü received as tribute oyster pearls from the\r\nriver Hwai, and from the province of King Kau he received “strings of\r\npearls that were not quite round.”[4] That ancient Chinese dictionary,\r\nthe Nh’ya, originating thirty centuries ago, speaks of them as precious\r\njewels found in the province of Shen-si on the western frontier.\r\n\r\nMany fantastic theories regarding pearls are to be found in ancient\r\nChinese literature. Some writers credited them as originating in the\r\nbrain of the fabled dragon; others noted that they were especially\r\nabundant during the reign of illustrious emperors, and they were used as\r\namulets and charms against fire and other disasters. Curious allusions\r\nwere made to pearls so brilliant that they were visible at a distance of\r\nnearly a thousand yards, or that rice could be cooked by the light from\r\nthem. And one found about the beginning of the Christian era, near\r\nYangchow-fu, in the province of Kiang-su, was reported so lustrous as to\r\nbe visible in the dark at a distance of three miles.\r\n\r\nIn Persia, the popularity of pearls seems to date from a very early\r\nperiod. Professor Jackson states that if they are not mentioned in the\r\nextant fragments of the ancient Zoroastrian literature, the Avesta and\r\nthe Pahlavi, or by the Middle Persian books from the seventh century\r\nB.C. to the ninth century A.D., it is probably a mere accident, due to\r\nthe character of the work or to the fragmentary condition of the\r\nliterature; for pearls were well known during that entire period, and\r\nseem to be indicated in extant sculptures. The coin and the gem\r\nportraits of Persian queens commonly show ear-pendants of these. The\r\nremains of a magnificent necklace of pearls and other gems were recently\r\nfound by J. de Morgan in the sarcophagus of an Achæmenid princess\r\nexhumed at Susa or Shushan, the winter residence of the kings of Persia.\r\nThis necklace, perhaps the most ancient pearl ornament still in\r\nexistence, dates certainly from not later than the fourth century B.C.,\r\nand is now preserved in the Persian Gallery of the Louvre.[5] Even if we\r\nhad no other evidence, it would be natural to assume that the knowledge\r\nof pearls was as wide-spread among the Iranians in antiquity as it was\r\namong the Hindus, since the Persian Gulf, like the Indian Ocean, has\r\nbeen famous for its fisheries from ancient times.\r\n\r\nIn the ruins of Babylon no pearls have been found; indeed, it would be\r\nsurprising if they could survive for so many ages in the relatively\r\nmoist soil which contains much saltpeter. Inlays of mother-of-pearl and\r\ndecorations of this material have been secured from the ruins of\r\nBismaya, which Dr. Edgar J. Banks refers to about 4500 B.C.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise little evidence that pearls were extensively employed\r\nby the ancient Assyrians, notwithstanding that excavations at Nineveh\r\nand Nimrud have furnished much information regarding their ornaments;\r\nand the collars, bracelets, sword-hilts, etc., wrought in gold and\r\nornamented with gems, show that the jewelers’ art had made much\r\nprogress. This is not wholly trustworthy as determining the relative\r\nabundance; for being of organic or non-mineral origin, pearls would not\r\nhave survived the burial for thousands of years so well as the crystal\r\ngems. An inscription on the Nineveh Obelisk, which states, according to\r\nSir Henry Rawlinson, that in the ninth year of his reign Temenbar\r\nreceived, as “tribute of the kings of the Chaldees, gold, silver, gems,\r\nand pearls,”[6] shows that the sea-born gems were highly valued there.\r\n\r\nThe mother-of-pearl shell was in use as an ornament in ancient Egypt\r\ncertainly as early as the sixth dynasty (_circa_ 3200 B.C.), the period\r\nof the Tanis Sphinx. In a recent letter from Luxor, where he is studying\r\nthe ruins of ancient Thebes, Dr. James T. Dennis states that he has\r\nfound several of these shells bearing cartouches of that period; and in\r\nthe “pan-bearing graves” of the twelfth dynasty (2500 B.C.), the shell\r\noccurred not only complete, but cut in roughly circular or oblong\r\nangular blocks and strung on chains with beads of carnelian, pottery,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be determined from the representations of ancient Egyptian\r\ncostumes, pearls do not seem to have been employed to any great extent\r\nin their decoration. The necklaces, earrings, and other jewels found in\r\nthe tombs, which are composed largely of gold set with crystal gems,\r\ncontain the remains of a few pearls, but give no indication that they\r\nwere numerous. In fact, no evidence exists that they were used\r\nextensively before the Persian conquest in the fifth century B.C.; and\r\nprobably it was not until the time of the Ptolemies that there began the\r\nlavish abundance which characterized the court of Alexandria at the\r\nheight of her power.\r\n\r\nThe authorities differ in regard to the mention of pearls in ancient\r\nHebrew literature; although in the Authorized Version of the Old\r\nTestament, this significance has been given to the word _gabîsh_ in Job\r\nxxviii. 18, where the value of wisdom is contrasted with that of\r\n_gabîsh_. Some writers claim that this word refers to rock crystal.\r\nOther authorities are of the opinion that the word _peninim_ in Lam. iv.\r\n7, which has been translated as “rubies,” actually signifies pearls. In\r\nGen. ii. 12, Prof. Paul Haupt has proposed to render _shoham_ stones by\r\npearls, since the Hebrew word translated “onyx,” if connected with the\r\nAssyrian _sându_, might mean “the gray gem.” It does not appear that\r\nthey entered into the decorations of the Tabernacle and the Temple, or\r\nwere largely employed in the paraphernalia of the synagogue.\r\n\r\nIn the New Testament, however, there are numerous references to the\r\nestimation in which pearls were held. In his teachings, Christ\r\nrepeatedly referred to them as typifying something most precious: “The\r\nkingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls:\r\nwho, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that\r\nhe had, and bought it” (Matt. xiii. 45, 46); and in “casting pearls\r\nbefore swine,” in that great Sermon on the Mount (Matt. vii. 6). In\r\npicturing the glories of the Heavenly City, St. John made the twelve\r\ngates of pearls (Rev. xxi. 21); and what could better serve as portals\r\nthrough the walls of precious stones?\r\n\r\nIn the Talmud, pearls are frequently mentioned, and usually as\r\nsignifying something beautiful or very costly, as “a pearl that is worth\r\nthousands of zuzim” (Baba Batra, 146a); a “pearl that has no price”\r\n(Yerushalmi, ix. 12d); the coats which God made for Adam and Eve were\r\n“as beautiful as pearls” (Gen. R. xx. 12), and the manna was “as white\r\nas a pearl” (Yoma, 75a). Their purchase formed one of the exceptions to\r\nthe law of _Ona’ah_ (overcharge), for the reason that two matched pearls\r\ngreatly exceeded the value of each one separately (Baba Mezi’a, iv. 8).\r\n\r\nThe high value attached to pearls by the ancient Hebrews is illustrated\r\nby a beautiful Rabbinical story in which only one object in nature is\r\nranked above them. On approaching Egypt, Abraham hid Sarah in a chest,\r\nthat foreign eyes might not behold her beauty. When he reached the place\r\nfor paying custom dues, the collectors said, “Pay us the custom”; and he\r\nreplied, “I will pay your custom.” They said to him, “Thou carriest\r\nclothes”; and he stated, “I will pay for clothes.” Then they said to\r\nhim, “Thou carriest gold”; and he answered, “I will pay for gold.” On\r\nthis they said to him, “Surely thou bearest the finest silk”; and he\r\nreplied, “I will pay custom for the finest silk.” Then said they, “Truly\r\nit must be pearls that thou takest with thee”; and he answered, “I will\r\npay for pearls.” Seeing that they could name nothing of value for which\r\nthe patriarch was not willing to pay custom, they said, “It cannot be\r\nbut that thou open the box and let us see what is within.” So the chest\r\nwas opened, and the land was illumined by the luster of Sarah’s\r\nbeauty.[7]\r\n\r\nThe love which the early Arabs bore to pearls is evidenced by the\r\nreferences to them in the Koran, and especially the figurative\r\ndescription given of Paradise. The stones are pearls and jacinths; the\r\nfruits of the trees are pearls and emeralds; and each person admitted to\r\nthe delights of the celestial kingdom is provided with a tent of pearls,\r\njacinths and emeralds; is crowned with pearls of incomparable luster,\r\nand is attended by beautiful maidens resembling hidden pearls.[8]\r\n\r\nThe estimation of pearls among the art-loving Greeks may be traced to\r\nthe time of Homer, who appears to have alluded to them under the name\r\nτρίγληνα (triple drops or beads) in his description of Juno; in the\r\nIliad, XIV, 183:\r\n\r\n                            In three bright drops,\r\n              Her glittering gems suspended from her ears.\r\n\r\nand in the Odyssey, XVIII, 298:\r\n\r\n                           Earrings bright\r\n             With triple drops that cast a trembling light.\r\n\r\nClassical designs of Juno usually show the three pear-shaped pearls\r\npendent from her ears. The ancient Greeks probably obtained their pearls\r\nfrom the East through the medium of Phenician traders, and a survival of\r\nthe word τρίγληνα seems to exist in the Welsh _glain_ (bead), the name\r\nhaving been carried to Britain by the same traders, who exchanged\r\ntextiles, glass beads, etc., for tin and salt.\r\n\r\nThe Persian wars in the fifth century B.C., doubtless extended the\r\nacquaintance which the Greeks had with pearls, as well as with other\r\noriental products, and increased their popularity. One of the earliest\r\nof the Greek writers to mention pearls specifically appears to have been\r\nTheophrastus (372–287 B.C.), the disciple and successor of Aristotle,\r\nwho referred to them under the name μαργαρίτης (_margarites_), probably\r\nderived from some oriental word like the Sanskrit _maracata_ or the\r\nPersian _mirwareed_. He stated that pearls were produced by shell-fish\r\nresembling the _pinna_, only smaller, and were used in making necklaces\r\nof great value. In Pliny’s “Historia naturalis,” that great storehouse\r\nof classical learning, reference is made to many other writers—mostly\r\nGreeks—who treated of gems; but virtually all of these writings have\r\ndisappeared, except fragments from Theophrastus, Chares of Mytilene, and\r\nIsidorus of Charace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRECIAN PEARL AND GOLD NECKLACE\r\n\r\n  Of about third century B.C.\r\n\r\n  Now in Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom Greece admiration for pearls quickly extended to Rome, where they\r\nwere known under the Greek word _margaritæ_. However, a more common name\r\nfor this gem in Rome was _unio_, which Pliny explained by saying that\r\neach pearl was unique and unlike any other one. The conclusion of the\r\nhistorian Ammianus Marcellinus (330–395 A.D.), that it was because each\r\none was found singly in a shell,[9] seems scarcely correct. Claude de\r\nSaumaise, the French classical scholar, thought that the common name for\r\nan onion was transferred to the pearl, owing to its laminated\r\nconstruction.[10] According to Pliny, the Romans used the word _unio_ to\r\ndistinguish a large perfect pearl from the smaller and less attractive\r\nones, which were called _margaritæ_.[11]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the Mithridatic Wars (88–63 B.C.) and the conquests by\r\nPompey that pearls were very abundant and popular in Rome, the great\r\ntreasures of the East enriching the victorious army and through it the\r\naristocracy of the republic. In those greatest spectacular functions the\r\nworld has ever known—the triumphal processions of the conquering\r\nRomans—pearls had a prominent part. Pliny records that in great Pompey’s\r\ntriumphal procession in 61 B.C. were borne thirty-three crowns of pearls\r\nand numerous pearl ornaments, including a portrait of the victor, and a\r\nshrine dedicated to the muses, adorned with the same gems.[12]\r\n\r\nThe luxuries of Mithridates, the treasures of Alexandria, the riches of\r\nthe Orient were poured into the lap of victory-fattened Rome. From that\r\ntime the pearl reigned supreme, not only in the enormous prices given\r\nfor single specimens, but also in the great abundance in possession of\r\nthe degenerate descendants of the victorious Romans. The interior of the\r\ntemple of Venus was decorated with pearls. The dress of the wealthy was\r\nso pearl-bedecked that Pliny exclaimed in irony: “It is not sufficient\r\nfor them to wear pearls, but they must trample and walk over them”;[13]\r\nand the women wore pearls even in the still hours of the night, so that\r\nin their sleep they might be conscious of possessing the beautiful\r\ngems.[14]\r\n\r\nIt is related that the voluptuous Caligula (12–41 A.D.)—he who raised\r\nhis favorite horse Incitatus to the consulship—decorated that horse with\r\na pearl necklace, and that he himself wore slippers embroidered with\r\npearls; and the tyrannical Nero (37–68 A.D.), not content with having\r\nhis scepter and throne of pearls, provided the actors in his theater\r\nwith masks and scepters decorated with them. Thus wrote the observant\r\nPhilo, the envoy of the Jews to the Emperor Caligula: “The couches upon\r\nwhich the Romans recline at their repasts shine with gold and pearls;\r\nthey are splendid with purple coverings interwoven with pearls and\r\ngold.”\r\n\r\nYet not all the men of Rome were enthusiastic over the beautiful “gems\r\nof the sea, which resemble milk and snow,” as the poet Manlius called\r\nthem. Even then, as now, there were some faultfinders. The immortal\r\nCæsar interdicted their use by women beneath a certain rank; Martial and\r\nTibullus inveighed against them; the witty Horace directed his stinging\r\nshafts of satire against the extravagance. Referring to a woman named\r\nGellia, Martial wrote: “By no gods or goddesses does she swear, but by\r\nher pearls. These she embraces and kisses. These she calls her brothers\r\nand sisters. She loves them more dearly than her two sons. Should she by\r\nsome chance lose them, the miserable woman would not survive an\r\nhour.”[15] Hear what stern old Seneca had to say: “Pearls offer\r\nthemselves to my view. Simply one for each ear? No! The lobes of our\r\nladies have attained a special capacity for supporting a great number.\r\nTwo pearls alongside of each other, with a third suspended above, now\r\nform a single earring! The crazy fools seem to think that their husbands\r\nare not sufficiently tormented unless they wear the value of an\r\ninheritance in each ear!”[16]\r\n\r\nThe prices reported for some choice ones at that time seem fabulous. It\r\nis recorded by Suetonius, that the Roman general, Vitellius, paid the\r\nexpenses of a military campaign with the proceeds of one pearl from his\r\nmother’s ears: “_Atque ex aure matris detractum unionem pigneraverit ad\r\nitineris impensas_.” In his “_Historia naturalis_,” Pliny says that in\r\nthe first century A.D., they ranked first in value among all precious\r\nthings,[17] and reports sixty million sestertii[18] as the value of the\r\ntwo famous pearls—“the singular and only jewels of the world and even\r\nnature’s wonder”—which Cleopatra wore at the celebrated banquet to Mark\r\nAntony. And Suetonius[19] places at six million sestertii the value of\r\nthe one presented by Julius Cæsar as a tribute of love to Servilia, the\r\nmother of Brutus, who thus wore\r\n\r\n                  The spoils of nations in an ear,\r\n                  Changed to the treasure of a shell.\r\n\r\nOr, as St. Jerome expressed it in his “Vita Pauli Eremitæ”:\r\n\r\n                   _Uno filo villarum insunt pretia._\r\n\r\nWe are told by Ælius Lampridius that an ambassador once brought to\r\nAlexander Severus two remarkably large and heavy pearls for the empress.\r\nThe emperor offered them for sale, and as no purchaser was found, he had\r\nthem hung in the ears of the statue of Venus, saying: “If the empress\r\nshould have such pearls, she would give a bad example to the other\r\nwomen, by wearing an ornament of so much value that no one could pay for\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nThe word “margarita” was used symbolically to designate the most\r\ncherished object; for instance, a favorite child. In an inscription\r\npublished by Fabretti, p. 44, No. 253, the word _margaritio_ has the\r\nsame significance. (Sex. Bruttidio juveni margaritioni carissimo, vixit\r\nannis II mensibus VII, diebus XVIII.)[20]\r\n\r\nWhile the ancient writers were familiar with the pearl itself, they knew\r\nlittle of the fisheries, and related many curious stories which had come\r\nto Athens and Rome. Pliny and Ælianus quoted from Megasthenes that the\r\npearl-oysters lived in communities like swarms of bees, and were\r\ngoverned by one remarkable for its size and great age, and which was\r\nwonderfully expert in keeping its subjects out of danger, and that the\r\nfishermen endeavored first to catch this one, so that the others might\r\neasily be secured. Procopius, one of the most entertaining of the old\r\nByzantine chroniclers, wrote of social relations between the\r\npearl-oysters and the sharks, and of methods of inducing the growth of\r\npearls.\r\n\r\nThe principal fisheries of antiquity were in the Persian Gulf, on the\r\ncoasts of Ceylon and India, and in the Red Sea. The pearls referred to\r\nin ancient Chinese literature appear to have been taken from the rivers\r\nand ponds of that country, while those in Cochin China and Japan seem to\r\nhave come from the adjoining seas. The pearls were distributed among the\r\nnations in control of the fisheries, and from them, other people\r\nreceived collections, either as presents, in conquest, or by way of\r\ntrade. History makes no mention of pearls having been obtained elsewhere\r\nthan in the Orient up to the time of Julius Cæsar, when small quantities\r\nof inexpensive ones were collected in Britain by the invading Romans.\r\nAnd in the first century A.D., Pliny states that small reddish pearls\r\nwere found about Italy and in the Bosphorus Straits near Constantinople.\r\n\r\nA number of specimens of pearls of the artistic Greeks and of the\r\nluxurious Romans are yet in existence, and some of these are in a fairly\r\ngood state of preservation. A notable and interesting example is a\r\nsuperb Greek necklace of pearls and gold, referred to the third century\r\nB.C., and now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Several\r\nearrings now in that museum, in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg, the\r\nBritish Museum, the Louvre in Paris, and in the Boston Museum of Fine\r\nArts, are shown in this book. Some of these may have decorated ears that\r\nlistened to the comedies of Aristophanes, the tragedies of Euripides,\r\nthe philosophies of Plato, or the oratory of Demosthenes. A number of\r\nclassic statues have the ears pierced for earrings, notably the Venus de\r\nMedici now in the Tribuna of the Uffizi, Florence; and a magnificent\r\npair of half-pearls is said to have decorated the Venus of the Pantheon\r\nin Rome.[21] Pearl grape earrings are shown on the artistic intaglio by\r\nAspasios, representing the bust of the Athene Parthenos of Phidias,\r\nwhich has been in the Gemmen Münzen Cabinet at Vienna since 1669.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Tyszkiewicz bronze statuette of Aphrodite was acquired in\r\n1900 by the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and has even yet a pearl in a\r\nfairly good state of preservation suspended from each ear by a spiral\r\nthread of gold which passes quite through the gem and also through the\r\nlobe of the ear. This statuette has been described as “the most\r\nbeautiful bronze Venus known.”[22] Professor Froehner considers that it\r\nbelongs nearer to the period of Phidias (_circa_ 500–430 B.C.) than to\r\nthat of Praxiteles (_circa_ 400–336 B.C.); but Dr. Edward Robinson does\r\nnot concur in this opinion, and refers it to the Hellenic period\r\n(_circa_ 330–146 B.C.).\r\n\r\nHowever, considering the very large accumulations, relatively few pearls\r\nof antiquity now remain, and none of these is of great ornamental value.\r\nThose in archæological collections and art museums are more or less\r\ndecayed through the ravages of time and accident to which they have been\r\nsubjected. While coins, gold jewelry, crystal gems, etc., of ancient\r\ncivilizations are relatively numerous, the less durable pearls have not\r\nsurvived the many centuries of pillage, waste, and burial in the earth.\r\n\r\nA well-known instance of this decay is found in the Stilicho pearls,\r\nwhich owe their prominence to the incident of their long burial. The\r\ndaughters of this famous Roman general, who were successively betrothed\r\nto the Emperor Honorius, died in 407 A.D., and were buried with their\r\npearls and ornaments. In 1526, or more than eleven centuries afterward,\r\nin excavating for an extension of St. Peter’s, the tomb was opened, and\r\nthe ornaments were found in fair condition, except the pearls, which\r\nwere as lusterless and dead as a wreath of last year’s flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\n                      MEDIEVAL AND MODERN HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n                 MEDIEVAL AND MODERN HISTORY OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n           I’ll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail\r\n           Rich pearls upon thee.\r\n                       _Antony and Cleopatra_, Act II, sc. 5.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of pearls in Rome has its counterpart in the Empire of\r\nthe East at Byzantium or Constantinople on its development in wealth and\r\nluxury after becoming the capital of that empire in 330 A.D. Owing to\r\nits control of the trade between Asia and Europe, and the influence of\r\noriental taste and fashion, enormous collections were made; and for\r\ncenturies after Rome had been pillaged, this capital was the focus of\r\nall the arts, and pearls were the favorite ornaments. The famous mosaic\r\nin the sanctuary of San Vitale at Ravenna, shows Justinian (483–565)\r\nwith his head covered with a jeweled cap, and the Empress Theodora\r\nwearing a tiara encircled by three rows of pearls, and strings of pearls\r\ndepend therefrom almost to the waist. In many instances the decorations\r\nof the emperors excelled even those of the most profligate of Roman\r\nrulers. An examination of the coins, from those of Arcadius in 395 to\r\nthe last dribble of a long line of obscure rulers when the city was\r\ncaptured and pillaged by Venetian and Latin adventurers in 1204, shows\r\nin the form of diadems, collars, necklaces, etc., the great quantity of\r\npearls worn by them. The oldest existing crown in use at the present\r\ntime, the Hungarian crown of St. Stephen, which is radiant with pearls,\r\nis of Byzantine workmanship.\r\n\r\nOutside of Constantinople, the demand and fashion for pearls did not\r\ncease with the downfall of the Roman Empire and the spoliation of Rome\r\nin the fifth century. The treasures accumulated there, and the gems and\r\njewels, were carried away by the conquering Goths and scattered among\r\nthe great territorial lords of western and northern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient cities of Gaul, in Toulouse and Narbonne, the Ostrogoth\r\nand the Visigoth kings collected enormous treasures. The citadel of\r\nCarcassonne held magnificent spoils brought from the sacking of Rome in\r\n410 by Alaric, king of the Ostrogoths, consisting in part of jewels from\r\nthe Temple, these having been carried to Rome after the spoliation of\r\nJerusalem in 70 A.D. Several beautiful objects of this and somewhat\r\nlater periods are yet in existence, notably the Visigothic crowns and\r\ncrosses, in the Musée de l’Hôtel de Cluny, Paris, the most beautiful of\r\nwhich are probably the crown and the cross of Reccesvinthus.[23]\r\n\r\nEven as the treasures of Rome were despoiled by the Ostrogoths and the\r\nVisigoths, so, later, their collections were depleted by the military\r\noperations of the Franks, when Narbonne was pillaged; when Toulouse was\r\nsacked by Clovis, or Chlodowig, in 507; when the churches of Barcelona\r\nand Toledo were despoiled by Childebert in 531 and 542; and by various\r\nexpeditions in succeeding years.\r\n\r\nThe military triumphs of the Franks placed them in the highest rank\r\namong the peoples of Europe, in the sixth and seventh centuries, in the\r\npossession of treasures of jewels which enriched their palaces and great\r\nchurches. And the taste which the triumphs of war had developed was\r\nmaintained by the trade carried on by the Jewish and Syrian merchants.\r\nThe inhabitants of Gaul were extremely fond of objects of art, of rich\r\ncostumes, and of personal decorations; and the courts of some of the\r\nearly kings rivaled in magnificence those of oriental monarchs.\r\nEspecially was this true during the reign of King Dagobert (628–638),\r\nwho competed in splendor with the rulers of Persia and India. His\r\nskilful jeweler, Eligius (588–659), was raised to the bishopric of\r\nNoyon, and eventually—under the name of St. Eloi—became one of the most\r\npopular saints in Gaul. Under direction of this artistic bishop, the\r\nancient churches received shrines, vestments, and reliquaries superbly\r\ndecorated with pearls and other gems. Indeed, for several centuries\r\nfollowing the time of Eligius, the greatest treasures of jewels seem to\r\nhave been collected in the churches.\r\n\r\nThe use of gems in enriching regalia, vestments, and reliquaries in\r\nEurope, advanced greatly during the reign of Charlemagne (768–814); and\r\nprinces and bishops competed with each other in the magnificence of\r\ntheir gifts to the churches, sacrificing their laical jewels for the\r\nsacred treasures. Few of the great ornaments of Charlemagne’s time are\r\nnow in existence in the original form. Doubtless the most remarkable\r\npieces are the sacred regalia of the great emperor, preserved among the\r\nimperial treasures in Vienna.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRONT COVER OF ASHBURNHAM MANUSCRIPT OF THE FOUR GOSPELS\r\n\r\n  From the ninth century. One quarter of the actual dimensions.\r\n\r\n  Owned by J. Pierpont Morgan, Esq.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn artistic use for pearls at that time was in the rich and elegant\r\nbindings of the splendidly written missals and chronicles, finished in\r\nthe highest degree of excellence and at vast expense. An artist might\r\ndevote his whole life to completing a single manuscript, so great was\r\nthe detail and so exquisite the finish. Vasari states that Julio Clovio\r\ndevoted nine years to painting twenty-six miniatures in the Breviary of\r\nthe Virgin now in the royal library at Naples. The library at Rouen has\r\na large missal on which a monk of St. Andoen is said to have labored for\r\nthirty years. These books were among the most valued possessions of the\r\nchurches, and their bindings were enriched with gold and pearls and\r\ncolored stones. The wealthy churches had many such volumes; Gregory of\r\nTours states that from Barcelona in 531 A.D. Childebert brought twenty\r\n“_evangeliorum capsas_” of pure gold set with gems. Several of these\r\nsuperbly bound volumes are yet in existence, in the Basilica of St. Mark\r\nin Venice; in the treasury of the cathedral at Milan; among the imperial\r\nRussian collections in the Ourejenaya Palata at Moscow, etc.; and they\r\nfurnish probably the most reliable examples of artistic jewel work of\r\nthe Dark Ages.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable specimen of these books in America is doubtless the\r\nAshburnham manuscript of the Four Gospels, now owned by J. Pierpont\r\nMorgan, Esq., which affords an interesting example of the jeweler’s art.\r\nFor many centuries it belonged to the Abbey of the Noble Canonesses,\r\nfounded, in 834, at Lindau, on Lake Constance. After an extended\r\nexamination, Mr. Alexander Nesbit concluded that the rich cover of the\r\nmanuscript was probably made between 896 and 899 by order of Emperor\r\nArnulf of the Carolingian dynasty. Most of the ninety-eight pearls\r\nappear to be from fresh water, and probably all of them were obtained\r\nfrom the rivers of Europe. This is one of the few remaining pieces of\r\nthe magnificent ecclesiastical jeweling of that period.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Charlemagne, internal dissensions, separations and\r\nthe division of the Empire into the nations of Europe, annihilated\r\ncommerce, oppressed the people, and impoverished the arts. In the ninth\r\ncentury, the Normans pillaged many of the palaces and churches in\r\nAngoulême, Tours, Orléans, Rouen, and Paris, and destroyed or carried\r\naway large treasures. The tenth and the eleventh centuries were indeed\r\nthe Dark Ages in respect to the cultivation of the arts; yet even during\r\nthat period the churches of western Europe received many gems from\r\npenitent and fear-stricken subjects. The heart of man, filled with the\r\nlove of God, laid its earthly treasure upon the altar in exchange for\r\nheavenly consolation. Pious faith dedicated pearls to the glorification\r\nof the ritual; altars, statues, and images of the saints, priestly\r\nvestments, and sacred vessels, were surcharged with them. The great\r\nmuseums and the imperial collections contain some beautiful and highly\r\nvenerated objects of this nature.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime pearls of small size and of fair luster had been\r\ncollected in the rivers of Scotland, Ireland, and France, the headwaters\r\nof the Danube, and in the countries north thereof. In England, as noted\r\nin the preceding chapter, they were obtained by Cæsar’s invading\r\nlegions, who carried many to Rome. Ancient coins indicate that pearls\r\nformed the principal ornament of the simple crowns worn by the early\r\nkings of Britain previous to Alfred the Great.\r\n\r\nThe river pearls were not so beautiful as oriental ones; but, owing to\r\nthe ease with which they were obtained, they were employed more\r\nextensively and especially in ecclesiastical decorations, the principal\r\nuse for pearls from the eighth to the eleventh century. Apparently\r\nauthentic specimens of fresh-water pearls of an early period are the\r\nfour now in the coronation spoon of the English regalia, which is\r\nattributed to the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nFrom the most ancient times until the overthrow of the Roman Empire,\r\npractically the only use for pearls was ornamental; but after the eighth\r\ncentury there developed a new employment for these as well as for other\r\ngems. Natural history was little studied in Europe from the ninth to the\r\nfourteenth century, except for the effect which its subjects had in\r\nmedicine and magic, which were closely allied. Largely through Arabic\r\ninfluence, the practice of medicine had developed into administering\r\nmost whimsical remedies, among which gems, and especially pearls, played\r\na prominent part, and belief in the influence of these was as strong as\r\nin that of the heavenly bodies. For this application, large demands had\r\narisen for pearls, which seem to have been prescribed for nearly every\r\nill to which the flesh was heir. On account of their cheapness, the\r\nsmall ones—seed-pearls—were used principally; though larger ones were\r\npreferred by persons who could afford them. While many of these\r\nso-called medicinal pearls were obtained from the Orient, most of them\r\nwere secured from the home streams in the north of Europe and in the\r\nBritish Isles.\r\n\r\nAfter the decadence of Roman power in the East, the rulers of India and\r\nPersia, through their control of the fisheries, again accumulated\r\nenormous quantities of pearls. All of the early travelers to those\r\ncountries were astonished at the lavish display of these gems in\r\ndecorative costume.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript of Renaudot’s two Mohammedans, who visited India and\r\nChina in the ninth century, notes that the kings of the Indies were rich\r\nin ornaments, “yet pearls are what they most esteem, and their value\r\nsurpasses that of all other jewels; they hoard them up in their\r\ntreasures with their most precious things. The grandees of the court,\r\nthe great officers and captains, wear the like jewels in their\r\ncollars.”[24]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRANCIS I, KING OF FRANCE, 1494–1547\r\n\r\n  Louvre, Paris\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ISABELLE DE VALOIS\r\n\r\n  By Pantoia de la Cruz, Prado Museum, Madrid\r\n]\r\n\r\nInventories of some of the oriental collections of later times seem to\r\nbe extravagant fiction rather than veritable history. In that\r\ninteresting book dictated in a Genoese prison to Rusticiano da Pisa,\r\naccounts are given by Marco Polo of great treasures seen by the first\r\nEuropeans to penetrate into China. He describes the king of Malabar as\r\nwearing suspended about his neck a string of 104 large pearls and rubies\r\nof great value, which he used as a rosary. Likewise on his legs were\r\nanklets and on his toes were rings, all thickly set with costly pearls,\r\nthe whole “worth more than a city’s ransom. And ’tis no wonder he hath\r\ngreat store of such gear; for they are found in his kingdom. No one is\r\npermitted to remove therefrom a pearl weighing more than half a\r\n_saggio_. The king desires to reserve all such to himself, and so the\r\nquantity he has is almost incredible.”[25]\r\n\r\nLater travelers give wonderful descriptions of this excessive passion\r\nfor pearls. Literature is full of this appreciation, and of the part\r\nwhich these gems played in the affairs of the Orientals. Who has not\r\ndwelt with delight upon those imperishable legends such as are embodied\r\nin the Arabian Nights, of the pearl voyages by Sindbad the Sailor, of\r\nthe wonderful treasure chests, and of the superb necklaces adorning the\r\nbeautiful black-eyed women!\r\n\r\nThe returning Crusaders in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and the\r\ndevelopment of the knightly orders, had much to do with spreading\r\nthrough Europe a fondness for pearls in personal decoration. Those who,\r\nlike Chaucer’s knight, had been with Peter, King of Cyprus, at the\r\ncapture and plunder when “Alexandria was won,” returned to their homes\r\nwith riches of pearls and gold and precious stones. And learning much\r\nrelative to decorative art from Moorish craftsmen, the jewelers of\r\nwestern Europe set these in designs not always crude and ineffective.\r\n\r\nAlthough they were well known and valued, pearls do not seem to have\r\nbeen much used in England before the twelfth century, as the\r\nAnglo-Saxons were not an especially art-loving people. The word itself\r\nis of foreign derivation and occurs in a similar form in all modern\r\nlanguages, both Romance and Teutonic; _perle_, French and German;\r\n_perla_, Italian, Portuguese, Provençal, Spanish, and Swedish; _paarl_,\r\nDanish and Dutch. Its origin is doubtful. Some philologists consider it\r\nTeutonic and the diminutive of _beere_, a berry; Claude de Saumaise\r\nderives it from _pirula_, the diminutive of _pirum_, a sphere; while\r\nDiez and many others refer it to _pira_ or to the medieval Latin\r\n_pirula_, in allusion to the pear shape frequently assumed by the\r\npearl.[26]\r\n\r\nThe word pearl seems to have come into general use in the English\r\nlanguage about the fourteenth century. In Wyclif’s translation of the\r\nScriptures (about 1360), he commonly used the word _margarite_ or\r\n_margaritis_, whereas Tyndale’s translation (1526) in similar places\r\nused the word _perle_. Tyndale translated Matt. xiii. 46: “When he had\r\nfounde one precious pearle”; Wyclif used “oo preciouse margarite.” Also\r\nin Matt. vii. 6, Tyndale wrote, “Nether caste ye youre pearles before\r\nswyne”; yet Wyclif used “margaritis,” although twenty years later he\r\nexpressed it “putten precious perlis to hoggis.” Langland’s Piers\r\nPlowman (1362), XI, 9, wrote this: “_Noli mittere_ Margeri perles Among\r\nhogges.” The oldest English version of Mandeville’s Travels, written\r\nabout 1400, contained the expression: “The fyn Perl congeles and wexes\r\ngret of the dew of hevene”; but in 1447, Bokenham’s “Seyntys” stated: “A\r\nmargerye perle aftyr the phylosophyr Growyth on a shelle of lytyl\r\npryhs”; and Knight de la Tour (about 1450) stated: “The sowle is the\r\nprecious marguarite unto God.”\r\n\r\nThe word is given “perle” in the earliest manuscripts of those old epic\r\npoems of the fourteenth century, “Pearl” and “Cleanness,” which have\r\ncaused so much learned theological discussion and which testify to the\r\ngreat love and esteem in which the gem was held. The first stanza of\r\n“Pearl” we quote from Gollancz’s rendition:\r\n\r\n                Pearl! fair enow for princes’ pleasance,\r\n                  so deftly set in gold so pure,—\r\n                from orient lands I durst avouch,\r\n                  ne’er saw I a gem its peer,—\r\n                so round, so comely-shaped withal,\r\n                  so small, with sides so smooth,—\r\n                where’er I judged of radiant gems,\r\n                  I placed my pearl supreme.[27]\r\n\r\nThe fourteenth-century manuscript in the British Museum gives this as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                 Perle plesaunte to prynces paye,\r\n                   To clanly clos in gold so clere,\r\n                 Oute of oryent I hardyly saye,\r\n                   Ne proved I never her precios pere,—\r\n                 So rounde, so reken in uche a raye,\r\n                   So smal, so smothe her sydez were,—\r\n                 Queresoever I jugged gemmez gaye,\r\n                   I sette hyr sengeley in synglere.\r\n\r\nAnd from a modern rendering of “Cleanness” we quote:\r\n\r\n         The pearl is praised wherever gems are seen,\r\n           though it be not the dearest by way of merchandise.\r\n         Why is the pearl so prized, save for its purity,\r\n           that wins praise for it above all white stones?\r\n         It shineth so bright; it is so round of shape;\r\n           without fault or stain; if it be truly a pearl.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries throughout Europe pearls were\r\nvery fashionable as personal ornaments, and were worn in enormous\r\nquantities; the dresses of men as well as of women were decorated and\r\nembroidered with them, and they were noted in nearly every account of a\r\nfestive occasion, whether it were a marriage, a brilliant tourney, the\r\nconsecration of a bishop, or the celebration of a victory in battle.\r\n\r\nThe faceting of crystal gems was not known at that time, and those\r\ndependent on artifice for their beauty were not much sought after.\r\nAlthough the diamond had been known from the eighth century, it was not\r\ngenerally treasured as an ornament, and not until long after the\r\ninvention of cutting in regular facets—about 1450—did it attain its\r\ngreat popularity.\r\n\r\nIn the Dark Ages, it was customary for princes and great nobles to carry\r\ntheir valuables about with them even on the battle-fields; first, in\r\norder to have them always in possession, and second, on account of the\r\nmysterious power they attributed to precious stones. Since jewels\r\nconstituted a large portion of their portable wealth, nobles and knights\r\nwent into battle superbly arrayed. In this manner the treasures were\r\neasily lost and destroyed; consequently, relatively few of the personal\r\nornaments of that period are preserved to the present time.\r\n\r\nAmong the greatest lovers of pearls in the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies were the members of the ducal house of Burgundy, and\r\nespecially Philip the Bold (1342–1404), Philip the Good (1396–1467), and\r\nCharles the Bold (1433–77), and some of the gems which they owned are\r\neven now treasured in Austria, Spain, and Italy. When Duke Charles the\r\nBold, in the year 1473, attended the Diet of Treves, accompanied by his\r\nfive thousand splendidly equipped horsemen, he was attired in cloth of\r\ngold garnished with pearls, which were valued at 200,000 golden\r\nflorins.[28] We are told that “almost a sea of pearls” was on view at\r\nthe marriage of George the Rich with Hedwig, the daughter of Casimir III\r\nof Poland, at Landshut, in 1475. Among the many ornaments was a pearl\r\nchaplet valued at 50,000 florins which Duke George wore on his hat, and\r\nalso a clasp worth 6000 florins.[29] Members of the related houses of\r\nAnjou and Valois also held great collections. Nor in this account should\r\nwe omit some of the English sovereigns, including especially Richard II\r\n(1366–1400), one of the greatest dandies of his day.\r\n\r\nDuring the fifteenth century, enormous quantities of pearls were worn by\r\npersons of rank and fashion. A remarkable 1483 portrait of Margaret,\r\nwife of James III of Scotland, which is now preserved at Hampton Court,\r\nshows her wearing such wonderful pearl ornaments that she might well be\r\ncalled Margaret from her decorations. As this queen was praised for her\r\nbeauty, we fear the artist has scarcely done justice to her appearance;\r\nor possibly since that period tastes have changed as to what on a throne\r\npasses for beauty. Her head-dress is undoubtedly the most remarkable\r\npearl decoration which we have seen of that century.\r\n\r\nThe uxorious and sumptuous Henry VIII of England (1491–1547) spent much\r\nof the great wealth accumulated by his penurious father, Henry VII, in\r\nenriching the appearance of his semi-barbaric court. In this reign, the\r\nspoliation of the Catholic cathedrals and churches contributed many\r\npearls to the royal treasury; and onward from that time, they were\r\nprominently displayed among the ornaments of the women of rank in\r\nEngland. Most of the portraits of Henry’s wives show great quantities of\r\nthese gems; many of them with settings doubtless designed by artistic\r\nHans Holbein the Younger (1497–1543); and during the succeeding reigns\r\nthe women near the throne were commonly depicted with elaborate pearl\r\ndecorations.\r\n\r\nThe cold, unflattering portraits by Holbein of the court celebrities of\r\nthat period, not only of the gracious women and of the dandified men,\r\nbut of the clergy as well, show the prominence of pearls. Note his\r\nportrait of Jane Seymour, of Anne of Cleves, of Christina of Denmark,\r\nand the pearl-incrusted miter of Archbishop Warham of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nAn interesting story is told of Sir Thomas More, the learned chancellor\r\nof Henry VIII, showing his view of the great display of jewels which\r\ndistinguished the period in which he lived:\r\n\r\n  His sonne John’s wife often had requested her father-in-law, Sir\r\n  Thomas, to buy her a billiment sett with pearles. He had often put\r\n  her off with many pretty slights; but at last, for her importunity,\r\n  he provided her one. Instead of pearles, he caused white peaze to be\r\n  sett, so that at his next coming home, his daughter-in-law demanded\r\n  her jewel. “Ay, marry, daughter, I have not forgotten thee!” So out\r\n  of his studie he sent for a box, and solemnlie delivered it to her.\r\n  When she, with great joy, lookt for her billiment, she found, far\r\n  from her expectation, a billiment of peaze; and so she almost wept\r\n  for verie griefe.[30]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in the yet unknown America, pearls were highly prized, and\r\ntheir magic charm had taken an irresistible hold on aborigines and on\r\nthe more highly civilized inhabitants of Mexico and Peru. In Mexico the\r\npalaces of Montezuma were studded with pearls and emeralds, and the\r\nAztec kings possessed pearls of inestimable value. That they had been\r\ncollected elsewhere for a long time is evidenced by the large quantities\r\nin the recently opened mounds of the Ohio Valley, which rank among the\r\nancient works of man in America. As in the Old World, so in the New,\r\nthey had been used as decoration for the gods and for the temples, as\r\nwell as for men and women.\r\n\r\nThe principal immediate effect of Columbus’s discovery and of the\r\ncommercial intercourse with the New World, was the great wealth of\r\npearls which enriched the Spanish traders. The natives were found in\r\npossession of rich fisheries on the coast of Venezuela, and somewhat\r\nlater on the Pacific coast of Panama and Mexico, whence Eldorado\r\nadventurers returned to Spain with such large collections that—using an\r\nold chronicler’s expression—“they were to every man like chaff.” For\r\nmany years America was best known in Seville, Cadiz, and some other\r\nports of Europe, as the land whence the pearls came. Until the\r\ndevelopment of the mines in Mexico and Peru, the value of the pearls\r\nexceeded that of all other exports combined. Humboldt states that till\r\n1530 these averaged in value more than 800,000 piastres yearly.[31] And\r\nthroughout the sixteenth century the American fisheries—prosecuted by\r\nthe Spaniards with the help of native labor—furnished Europe with large\r\nquantities, the records for one year showing imports of “697 pounds’\r\nweight” into Seville alone.\r\n\r\nFor two centuries following the discovery of America, extravagance in\r\npersonal decoration was almost unlimited at the European courts, and the\r\npearls exceeded in quantity that of all other gems. Enormous numbers\r\nwere worn by persons of rank and fortune. This is apparent, not only\r\nfrom the antiquarian records and the historical accounts, but also in\r\nthe paintings and engravings of that time; portraits of the Hapsburgs,\r\nthe Valois, the Medicis, the Borgias, the Tudors, and the Stuarts show\r\ngreat quantities of pearls, and relatively few other gems.\r\n\r\nProbably the largest treasures were in possession of the Hapsburg\r\nfamily, which furnished so many sovereigns to the Holy Roman Empire, to\r\nAustria, and to Spain, and which, by descent through Maria Theresa,\r\ncontinued to rule the Holy Roman Empire until its abolition in 1806, and\r\nhas since ruled Austria and Hungary.\r\n\r\nA number of superb pieces of jewelry owned centuries ago by members of\r\nthis illustrious family are yet in existence; notably the buckle of\r\nCharles V, and especially the imperial crown of Austria, made in 1602 by\r\norder of Rudolph II.[32]\r\n\r\nTwo great women of that period are noted for their passion for pearls,\r\nCatharine de’ Medici (1519–89), and Elizabeth of England (1533–1603). It\r\nrequires but a glance at almost any of their portraits, wherein they are\r\nrepresented wearing elaborate pearl ornaments, to see to what an extent\r\nthey carried this fondness. And many other women were not far behind\r\nthem, among whom were Mary Stuart, Marie de’ Medici, and Henrietta\r\nMaria. And not only by the women, but by the men also, pearls were worn\r\nto what now seems an extravagant extent. Nearly all the portraits of\r\nFrancis I (1494–1547), Henry II (1519–59), Charles IX (1550–74), and\r\nHenry III (1551–89) of France; of James I (1566–1625), and of Charles I\r\n(1600–49) of England, and likewise of other celebrities, show a great\r\npear-shaped pearl in one ear. Many portraits also show pearls on the\r\nhats, cloaks, gloves, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke of Buckingham went to Paris in 1625, to bring over\r\nHenrietta Maria to be queen to Charles I, he had, according to an\r\naccount in the “Antiquarian Repertory,” in addition to twenty-six other\r\nsuits, “a rich suit of purple satin, embroidered all over with rich\r\norient pearls, the cloak made after the Spanish mode, with all things\r\nsuitable, the value whereof will be twenty thousand pounds, and this, it\r\nis thought, shall be for the wedding day at Paris.”\r\n\r\nIn the rich and prosperous cities of southern Europe, pearls were no\r\nless popular. From its share of the spoils of the Byzantine Empire,\r\nafter its partition in 1204, pearls and other riches were plentiful in\r\nVenice, and they were increased by the rapidly developing trade with the\r\nOrient. In the rival maritime cities, Genoa and Pisa, the gem was\r\nequally popular; and likewise in Florence “the Beautiful.” When Hercule\r\nd’Este sought Lucrezia Borgia (1480–1519) in marriage for his son, her\r\nfather, Pope Alexander VI, plunging both hands in a box filled with\r\npearls, said: “All these are for her! I desire that in all Italy she\r\nshall be the princess with the most beautiful pearls and with the\r\ngreatest number.”[33]\r\n\r\nSeparated by three centuries of time and by the intervening simplicities\r\nof puritanism and democracy, it is difficult for us to appreciate the\r\npassion for pearls in Europe at that period, which may well be called\r\nthe Pearl Age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MARIA THERESA (1717–1780), QUEEN OF HUNGARY\r\n\r\n  By Martin de Mytens, 1742\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe sumptuary laws which prevailed at different times in France,\r\nEngland, Germany, and other countries, did not overlook this\r\nextravagance; and an entire volume might be devoted to the efforts to\r\ncurb the excessive use. In France they were probably most stringent\r\nduring the reign of Philip IV (1285–1314), of Louis XI (1461–83), of\r\nCharles IX (1560–74), of Henry III (1574–89), and of Louis XIII\r\n(1610–43). In Germany almost every city had its special restrictions. A\r\nsumptuary law of Ulm, in 1345, provided that no married woman or maiden,\r\neither among the patricians or the artisans, should wear pearls on her\r\ndresses; and another, in 1411, restricted them to “one pearl chaplet,”\r\nand this should not exceed twelve _loth_ (half ounce) in weight. A\r\nFrankish sumptuary law of 1479 provided that ordinary nobles serving a\r\nknight at a tourney should not wear any pearl ornaments, embroidered or\r\notherwise, excepting one string around the cap or hat. The regulations\r\ndecreed by the Diet of Worms, in 1495, set forth that the citizens who\r\nwere not of noble birth, and nobles who were not knights, must withhold\r\nfrom the use of gold and pearls. A similar provision was enacted by the\r\nDiet of Freiburg in 1498, and likewise by the Diet of Augsburg in 1530,\r\nwhich permitted the wives of nobles four silk dresses, but without\r\npearls. In the sumptuary law of Duke John George of Saxony, April 23,\r\n1612, we read: “the nobility are not allowed to wear any dresses of gold\r\nor silver, or garnished with pearls; neither shall the professors and\r\ndoctors of the universities, nor their wives, wear any gold, silver or\r\npearls for fringes, or any chains of pearls, or caps, neck ornaments,\r\nshoes, slippers, shawls, pins, etc., with gold or silver or with\r\npearls.” Beadles, burgomasters, and those connected with the law-courts\r\nwere forbidden to wear chains of pearls and ornaments of precious stones\r\non their dresses, caps, etc., or slippers or chaplets with pearls.\r\n\r\nProbably in no place were these laws more stringent than in the\r\nart-loving republic of Venice from the fourteenth to the sixteenth\r\ncentury. This seems remarkable in view of the fact that this city was\r\nlargely dependent for its wealth and prominence on commerce with the\r\nEast, of which pearls constituted a prominent item.\r\n\r\nThe earliest Venetian restriction that we have found regarding pearls\r\nwas made in 1299; when, in a decree determining the maximum number of\r\nguests at a marriage ceremony and the extent of the bridal trousseau,\r\nthe grand council of the republic provided that no one but the bride\r\nshould wear pearl decorations, and she should be permitted only one\r\ngirdle of them on her wedding dress. This enactment was modified in\r\n1306, but numerous other restrictions were substituted, notably in 1334,\r\n1340, 1360, 1497, and 1562. These differed in many particulars: some\r\nforbade ornaments or trimmings of pearls, gold, or silver on the dresses\r\nof any women except a member of the Doge’s family; and other enactments\r\nrequired that, after a definite period of married life, no woman should\r\nbe permitted to wear pearls of any kind. But an examination of the\r\ndocuments and of the paintings of that period shows that these decrees\r\nhad little effect, and the luxury of the “Queen of the Adriatic” in the\r\nuse of pearls at the most brilliant epoch in her history is aptly\r\nreproduced in the portraits by Giovanni Bellini, Lorenzo Lotto, the\r\ngreat Titian, Tintoretto, Paul Veronese, and other artists of the\r\nhighest rank. In the engraving by Hendrik Goltzius of a marriage at\r\nVenice in 1584, not one of the many women present seems to be without\r\nher necklace and earrings of pearls, and some of them have several\r\nnecklaces.[34] And the same appears true of the principal female figures\r\nin Jost Amman’s noted engraving, “The Espousal of the Sea,” executed in\r\n1565.[35]\r\n\r\nAs preservation of the republic became more difficult with declining\r\nresources and with the continued growth of dazzling splendor, a\r\nresolution in the Senate, dated July 8, 1599, set forth that “the use\r\nand price of pearls has become so excessive and increases to such an\r\nextent from day to day, that if some remedy is not provided, it will\r\ncause injury, disorders, and notable inconvenience to public and private\r\nwell-being, as each one of this council in his wisdom can very easily\r\nappreciate.” And then it was enacted: “That, without repealing the other\r\nregulations which absolutely prohibit the wearing of pearls, it shall be\r\nexpressly enjoined that any woman, whether of noble birth or a simple\r\ncitizen, or of any other condition, who shall reside in this our city\r\nfor one year (except her Serenity the Dogaressa and her daughters and\r\nher daughters-in-law who live in the palace), after the expiration of\r\nfifteen years from the day of her first marriage, shall lay aside the\r\nstring of pearls around her neck and shall not wear or use, either upon\r\nher neck or upon any other part of her person, this string or any other\r\nkind of pearls or anything which imitates pearls, neither in this city\r\nnor in any other city or place within our dominion, under the\r\nirremissible penalty of two hundred ducats.”\r\n\r\nAnd yet ten years later, on May 5, 1609, another law enacted in the\r\nSenate stated:\r\n\r\n  Although in the year 1599 this council decided with great wisdom\r\n  that married women should be permitted to wear pearls for only\r\n  fifteen years after their first marriage, nevertheless it is very\r\n  evident that the desired end has not been attained, and the\r\n  extravagance has continued up to the present time and still\r\n  continues with the gravest injury to private persons. Therefore, as\r\n  it is necessary to remedy, by a new provision, not only this\r\n  considerable incommodity, but also to prevent in the future the\r\n  introduction into the city of a greater quantity of pearls than are\r\n  found here at present, it is enacted, that married women as well as\r\n  those who shall marry in the future (except the Serene Dogaressa and\r\n  her daughters and her daughters-in-law living in the palace) of\r\n  whatever grade and condition they may be, who have resided in this\r\n  city for one year, cannot wear pearls of any kind except for ten\r\n  years immediately following the day of their first marriage; and\r\n  after that period they must lay aside these pearls which they are\r\n  forbidden to wear on any part of their persons, at home or abroad,\r\n  and as well in this as in the other cities, lands, and other places\r\n  of our dominion, under the penalty of two hundred ducats. And if the\r\n  husband of the offending wife is a noble, he shall be proclaimed in\r\n  the greater council and declared a debtor to the office of the\r\n  governors of the revenue in the sum of twenty-five ducats for each\r\n  fine; and if he is a citizen or of any other condition, besides the\r\n  penalty of two hundred ducats and the fine of twenty-five ducats\r\n  above mentioned, he shall be banished for three years from Venice\r\n  and the Duchy, and the same for each offence. And pearls or anything\r\n  which imitates pearls, shall be forbidden to all other women, men\r\n  and boys or girls of every age and condition at all times and in all\r\n  places, under the same penalty of two hundred ducats. In the future\r\n  no one shall in any manner bring pearls to this city as merchandise,\r\n  under the penalty of their seizure and forfeiture. And the merchant\r\n  shall be imprisoned for five consecutive years; and if he flees, he\r\n  shall be banished from the city and district of Venice and from all\r\n  other cities, lands, and places of our dominion for eight\r\n  consecutive years.... And all who at present have pearls to sell are\r\n  required to deposit a list of them with the sumptuary office, so as\r\n  to avoid all fraud which could be practiced in this matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PARTI\r\n  PRESE\r\n  NELL ECCELLENTISS\r\n  Conseglio di Pregadi.\r\n\r\n  _1599. Adi 8. Luglio, & 1609. 5. Maggio._\r\n\r\n  In materia di Perle.\r\n\r\n  Stampata per Antonio Pinelli,\r\n  Stampator Ducale.\r\n  _A S. Maria Formosa, in Cale del Mondo Novo._\r\n]\r\n\r\nA copy of the title-page of this enactment is presented above.\r\n\r\nThe decrees and edicts were not confined to Venice, or to Italy, France,\r\nor Germany; they made their appearance quite generally throughout\r\nwestern and northern Europe and the interdictions of the civil\r\nauthorities were strengthened by the voice of the bishops and other\r\nclergy, especially in the imperial cities of southern Germany. Yet the\r\nunited authority of church and state was ineffectual in stemming the\r\ntide of fashion and personal fancy, and whether or not pearls should be\r\nworn became one of the much discussed questions of that period.\r\n\r\nTo the question, “Whether the statute and regulation of Bishop\r\nTudertinus, who had excommunicated all women who wore pearls, was\r\nbinding,” Joannes Guidius replied that many denied that this was so, and\r\nmade the subtle defense that “the women had not accepted it and all had\r\nworn pearls, and it was considered that such a law was binding only when\r\nit was accepted by those for whom it was intended.”[36]\r\n\r\nAnd as to the validity of the statutes requiring that women should not\r\nwear more than a definite number of pearls, he decided that “such a\r\nstatute is valid and in itself good. And if the question is put whether\r\nevery woman who infringes incurs the penalty, an answer may be gathered\r\nfrom the sayings of the doctors, who distinguish between married and\r\nunmarried women. They consider that an unmarried woman is obliged to\r\nobey the statute and regulation or to incur the penalty. But as to a\r\nmarried woman, if her husband approves, she should obey the statute; if,\r\nhowever, the husband objects, then the wife ought to wish to obey the\r\nstatute, but in effect she should rather obey her husband, for she is\r\nmost immediately and strongly bound to do this.”[37] Aided by such\r\ningenious opinions as these, the women continued to follow their own\r\ninclinations notwithstanding the opposition of church and state.\r\n\r\nOther fine distinctions were drawn by the lawyers of that day regarding\r\nownership of gems under certain conditions. For instance, it was decided\r\nthat pearls given by a father to his unmarried daughter remained her\r\nproperty after marriage because “they are given for a reason, namely to\r\ninduce a marriage”; yet “pearls handed to a wife by her husband are not\r\nconsidered as her property, but must be given to his heirs, since it is\r\nsupposed that they were given only for her adornment. The same holds\r\ngood as respects pearls handed to a daughter-in-law by her\r\nfather-in-law.”[38]\r\n\r\nHowever, the greed of fashion, which law-makers and bishops could not\r\narrest, was gradually satiated; and, influenced probably by the horrors\r\nof the Thirty Years’ War, more simple taste prevailed in the latter part\r\nof the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, improvements in cutting and polishing had greatly\r\nincreased the beauty and popularity of diamonds and other crystal gems,\r\nand this adversely affected the demand for pearls. Furthermore, cleverly\r\nfashioned imitations manufactured at a low cost also served to decrease\r\nthe relative rank and fashion of the sea-born gems. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury, pearls were relatively scarce; the resources of the American\r\nseas were largely exhausted, likewise the Ceylon and Red Sea fisheries\r\nwere not to be depended on, and practically the entire supply came from\r\nthe Persian Gulf, with a few from European rivers and the waters of\r\nChina. As a result, although they continued to be prized by\r\nconnoisseurs, pearls were not so extensively sought after by the rank\r\nand file of jewel purchasers.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, however, that from the most ancient times, the\r\nprinces of India and of Persia have had their pick and choice of the\r\noutput from Ceylon and the Persian Gulf; and the largest single\r\ncollections of the Western world have never equaled the possessions of\r\nsome of those rulers. Some Indian princes have loaded themselves with\r\nthousands of pearls, and individual ornaments have been valued not only\r\nby oriental, but by European experts, at several millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe great diamond resources of Brazil were discovered in 1727, and after\r\na few years these came on the market at the rate of 140,000 carats\r\nannually. At that time ladies of rank did not esteem diamonds so highly\r\nas pearls. This distinction was accentuated by Lord Hervey in his\r\naccount of the coronation, in 1727, of George II and his consort\r\nCaroline, who wore not only the great pearl necklace inherited from\r\nQueen Anne, but “had on her head and shoulders all the pearls she could\r\nborrow of the ladies of quality at one end of the town, and on her\r\npetticoat all the diamonds she could hire of the Jews and jewelers at\r\nthe other; so that the appearance and the truth of her finery was a\r\nmixture of magnificence and meanness not unlike the _éclat_ of royalty\r\nin many other particulars, when it comes to be nicely considered and its\r\nsource traced to what money hires or flattery lends.”[39] In a portrait\r\nof Charlotte (1744–1818), wife of George III, the pearls and diamonds\r\nappear equally popular.\r\n\r\nOn the entry of the British into possession of Ceylon in 1796, the\r\nfisheries of that country were resumed with great success after thirty\r\nyears of idleness, resulting in very large outputs for several seasons.\r\nBut owing to exhaustion of the areas, they were soon reduced, and the\r\nyield became small and uncertain.\r\n\r\nAbout 1845, pearls came on the market from the Tuamotu Archipelago and\r\nother South Sea islands, and the industry was revived on the Mexican\r\ncoast. The pearls from these localities are noted for their range of\r\ncoloration, and particularly for the very dark shades, black or greenish\r\nblack being especially prominent. But the fashion, and thus,\r\nnecessarily, the demand, had always been for white and yellow pearls;\r\nconsequently, these black ones were of little value in the markets until\r\nabout ten years later, when they became fashionable in Europe largely\r\nthrough their popularity with Empress Eugénie of France, then at the\r\nheight of her power. To this queen, pearls owe much of their high rank\r\nin fashion in the nineteenth century; and on her head they were royal\r\ngems royally worn, as appears from Winterhalter’s portrait of her,\r\nshowing her magnificent necklace.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the resources on the Australian coast about 1865, and\r\nthe development of the fishery there for mother-of-pearl, resulted in\r\nmany large white pearls coming from that coast. The search was confined\r\nto the relatively shoal waters, until the introduction of diving-suits\r\nabout 1880. The use of these facilitated a considerable extension of the\r\nfisheries not only on the Australian coast, but also in Mexico, the\r\nMalay Archipelago, several of the South Sea islands, and some minor\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nIn America, few jewels were worn previous to the Civil War, owing to the\r\nabsence of great wealth and to the simplicity of taste in personal\r\ndecorations. The rapid increase in wealth and luxury, on the termination\r\nof that war, resulted in a great demand for gems, and the most brilliant\r\nand showy ones were selected, especially diamonds. This demand was the\r\nmore readily supplied by the discovery of the South African mines, with\r\ntheir great yield from 1870 to the present time. So popular did that gem\r\nbecome that many a young man invested his first earnings in a\r\n“brilliant,” and an enormous diamond in the shirt-front became the\r\ncaricatured emblem of a prosperous hotel clerk.\r\n\r\nBut in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, in Europe, as well as\r\nin America and elsewhere where gems are worn, luxury found in pearls a\r\nrefinement, associated with richness and beauty, exceeding that of\r\ndiamonds and other crystal gems, and in the last few years they have\r\ntaken the highest rank among jewels. This change in fashion and the\r\nincrease in wealth among the people developed vastly greater demands and\r\nconsequently very much higher prices. These have resulted in greatly\r\nextending the field of search, and during the last two or three decades\r\nmany new territories have been brought into production.\r\n\r\nBy far the most important of these new regions is the Mississippi Valley\r\nin America, the pearl resources of which were made known about a score\r\nof years ago. As the exploitation developed, the gems from these streams\r\nadded very largely to the supply, especially of the baroque or irregular\r\npearls, which have increased greatly in fashion in the last ten years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n            LADY ABINGER                         MRS.

Certain individual fisheries are now less productive\r\nthan at the height of their prosperity; those in the Red Sea do not\r\ncompare favorably with their condition in ancient times, the European\r\nresources are nearly exhausted, the supplies from the Venezuelan coast\r\ndo not equal those obtained early in the sixteenth century, the yield\r\nfrom Mexico is not so extensive as twenty-five years ago, and the same\r\nis true of some other regions. On the other hand, the great fisheries of\r\nPersia and Ceylon are yet very prosperous, the Ceylon fishery of 1905\r\nsurpassing all records, and the number of minor pearling regions has\r\nlargely increased.\r\n\r\nThe present value of pearls—which has advanced enormously since 1893—is\r\ndue to the extended markets and the increased wealth and fashion in\r\nWestern countries, rather than to diminished fisheries. The oriental\r\ndemand still consumes the bulk of the Persian and Indian output, and the\r\nvast increase in wealth among the middle classes in America, Europe, and\r\nelsewhere, has increased the demand tenfold over that of a century ago.\r\nWhile women no longer appear ornamented from head to foot as in the\r\nsixteenth century, pearls are in the highest fashion, and the woman of\r\nrank and wealth usually prizes first among her jewels her necklace of\r\npearls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\n                            ORIGIN OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n                            ORIGIN OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Heaven-born and cradled in the deep blue sea, it is the purest of\r\n  gems and the most precious.\r\n\r\n                                                         S. M. ZWEMER.\r\n\r\nThe origin of pearls has been a fruitful subject of speculation and\r\ndiscussion among naturalists of all ages, and has provoked many curious\r\nexplanations. Most of the early views—universally accepted during those\r\ncenturies when tradition had more influence than observation and\r\nexperiment—have no standing among naturalists at the present time. And\r\nalthough much information has been gained as to the conditions\r\naccompanying their growth, and many theories are entertained, each with\r\nsome basis in observed fact, science does not yet speak with conclusive\r\nand unquestioned authority as to the precise manner of their origin and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nOwing to the chaste and subdued beauty of pearls, it is not strange that\r\npoets of many countries have founded their origin in tears—tears of\r\nangels, of water-nymphs, of the lovely and devoted. Sir Walter Scott in\r\n“The Bridal of Triermain” refers to—\r\n\r\n                    The pearls that long have slept,\r\n                    These were tears by Naiads wept.\r\n\r\nIn one of his most lovely and consoling thoughts, Shakspere says:\r\n\r\n             The liquid drops of tears that you have shed,\r\n             Shall come again, transform’d to orient pearl,\r\n             Advantaging their loan with interest\r\n             Of ten times double gain of happiness.\r\n\r\nAnd we quote from Rückert’s “Edelstein und Perlen”:\r\n\r\n           I was the Angel, who of old bowed down\r\n           From Heaven to earth and shed that tear, O Pearl,\r\n           From which thou wert first-fashioned in thy shell.\r\n           To thee I gave that longing in thy shell,\r\n           Which guided thee and caused thee to escape,\r\n           O Pearl, from the bewitching sirens’ song.\r\n\r\nIn luster they so closely resemble the limpid, sparkling dewdrop as it\r\nfirst receives the sun’s rays, that the ancients very naturally\r\nconceived that pearls are formed from drops of dew or rain. The usual\r\nlegend is, that at certain seasons of the year, the pearl-oysters rise\r\nto the surface of the water in the morning, and there open their shells\r\nand imbibe the dewdrops; these, aided by the breath of the air and the\r\nwarmth of the sunlight, are, in the course of time, transformed into\r\nlustrous pearls; but if the air and the sunlight are not received in\r\nsufficient quantities, the pearls do not attain perfection and are\r\nfaulty in form, color, and luster. However remarkable and even absurd\r\nthis may seem at present, it appears to have been universally accepted\r\nfor centuries by the most learned men of Europe as well as by primitive\r\npeople who delight in the mystical and fantastic. This opinion was\r\nrecorded in the Sanskrit books of the Brahmans and in other oriental\r\nliterature. The classical and medieval writings of Europe contain\r\nnumerous references to it; and it is found even yet in the traditions\r\nand folk-lore of some peoples.\r\n\r\nIn the first century A.D., Pliny wrote in his “Historia naturalis,”\r\naccording to Dr. Philemon Holland’s quaint translation:\r\n\r\n  The fruit of these shell fishes are the Pearles, better or worse,\r\n  great or small, according to the qualitie and quantitie of the dew\r\n  which they received. For if the dew were pure and cleare which went\r\n  into them, then are the Pearles white, faire, and Orient; but if\r\n  grosse and troubled, the Pearles likewise are dimme, foule, and\r\n  duskish; pale they are, if the weather were close, darke and\r\n  threatening raine in the time of their conception. Whereby (no\r\n  doubt) it is apparent and plaine, that they participate more of the\r\n  aire and sky, than of the water and the sea; for according as the\r\n  morning is faire, so are they cleere: but otherwise, if it were\r\n  misty and cloudy, they also will be thicke and muddy in colour. If\r\n  they may have their full time and season to feed, the Pearles\r\n  likewise will thrive and grow bigge: but if in the time it chance to\r\n  lighten, then they close their shells together, and for want of\r\n  nourishment are kept hungrie and fasting, and so the pearles keepe\r\n  at a stay and prosper not accordingly. But if it thunder withall,\r\n  then suddenly they shut hard at once, and breed only those\r\n  excrescences which be called _Physemata_, like unto bladders puft up\r\n  and hooved with wind, no corporal substance at all: and these are\r\n  the abortive & untimely fruits of these shell fishes.[40]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PANAMA SHELL\r\n\r\n  (_Margaritifera margaritifera mazatlanica_)\r\n\r\n  With pearls attached\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VENEZUELA SHELL\r\n\r\n  (_Margaritifera radiata_)\r\n\r\n  Showing growth of pearls\r\n]\r\n\r\nPliny’s views were probably derived from the ancient authorities of his\r\ntime, particularly from Megasthenes, Chares of Mytilene, and Isidorus of\r\nCharace; and these curious fictions were incorporated by subsequent\r\nwriters and influenced popular opinion for many centuries. With scarcely\r\na single exception, every recorded theory from the first century B.C. to\r\nthe fifteenth century evidences a belief in dew-formed pearls.\r\n\r\nThis theory is referred to by Thomas Moore in his well-known lines:\r\n\r\n            And precious the tear as that rain from the sky,\r\n            Which turns into pearls as it falls in the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish-Hebrew traveler Benjamin of Tudela, in his “Masaoth” in\r\nPersia (from 1160 to 1173), wrote: “In these places pearls are found,\r\nmade by the wonderful artifice of nature: for on the four and twentieth\r\nday of the month Nisan, a certain dew falleth into the waters, which\r\nbeing sucked in by the oysters, they immediately sink to the bottom of\r\nthe sea; afterwards, about the middle of the month Tisri, men descend to\r\nthe bottom of the sea, and, by the help of cords, these men bringing up\r\nthe oysters in great quantities from thence, open and take out of them\r\nthe pearls.”[41]\r\n\r\nFrom the “Bustan,” one of the most popular works of Sadi, the Persian\r\npoet (1190–1291 A.D.), Davie quotes:\r\n\r\n          From the cloud there descended a droplet of rain;\r\n          ’Twas ashamed when it saw the expanse of the main,\r\n          Saying: “Who may I be, where the sea has its run?\r\n          If the sea has existence, I, truly, have none!”\r\n          Since in its own eyes the drop humble appeared,\r\n          In its bosom, a shell with its life the drop reared;\r\n          The sky brought the work with success to a close,\r\n          And a famed royal pearl from the rain-drop arose.\r\n          Because it was humble it excellence gained;\r\n          Patiently waiting till success was attained.\r\n\r\nEven the usually well-informed William Camden (1551–1623), in whose\r\nhonor the Camden Historical Society of England was named, accepted the\r\ntheory of dew-formed pearls. He stated that the river Conway in Wales\r\n“breeds a kind of shells, which being pregnated with dew, produce\r\npearl.”[42] Also, speaking of the Irt in county Cumberland, England, he\r\nsaid: “In this brook, the shell-fish, eagerly sucking in the dew,\r\nconceive and bring forth pearls, or (to use the poet’s word) shell\r\nberries (_Baccas concheas_).”[43]\r\n\r\nA recent letter from the American consul at Aden indicates that this\r\nview is held even yet by the Arabs of that region. In giving their\r\nexplanation for the present scarcity in the Red Sea, he states: “There\r\nis a belief among them that a pearl is formed from a drop of rain caught\r\nin the mouth of the pearl-oyster, which by some chemical process after a\r\ntime turns into a pearl; and as there has been very little rain in that\r\nregion for several years past, there are few pearls.”\r\n\r\nSo firmly established throughout Europe was the belief in dew-formed\r\npearls, that its non-acceptance by the native Indians of America excited\r\nthe commiseration of the Italian historian Peter Martyr, in his “De Orbe\r\nNovo,” one of the very first books on America, published in 1517. He\r\nstates: “But that they [pearls of Margarita Island on the present coast\r\nof Venezuela] become white by the clearnesse of the morning dewe, or\r\nwaxe yelowe in troubled weather, or otherwise that they seeme to rejoice\r\nin fayre weather and dear ayre, or contrary-wise, to be as it were\r\nastonished and dymme in thunder and tempests, with such other, the\r\nperfect knowledge hereof is not to be looked for at the hands of these\r\nunlearned men, which handle the matter but grossly and enquire no\r\nfurther than occasion serveth.”[44] Peter Martyr was distinguished for\r\nhis learning, was an instructor at the court of Spain at the height of\r\nits power, and came in contact with the most enlightened men of Europe,\r\nconsequently it may be assumed that he reflected the best opinions of\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the aborigines of America were not alone in\r\ndiscrediting the views which had prevailed in Europe for more than\r\nfifteen hundred years. That practical old sailor Sir Richard Hawkins\r\nconcluded that this must be “some old philosopher’s conceit, for it can\r\nnot be made probable how the dew should come into the oyster.”[45] A\r\nsimilar view is expressed by Urbain Chauveton in his edition of Girolamo\r\nBenzoni’s “Historia del Mondo Nuovo,” published at Geneva in 1578. From\r\nhis reference to pearl-oysters on the Venezuelan coast, we translate:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Shells from Venezuela (_Margaritifera radiata_) with attached pearls\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Exterior view of same\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  X-ray photograph of shell, printed through exterior of shell and\r\n    showing encysted pearls\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Around the island of Cubagua and elsewhere on the eastern coast, are\r\n  sandy places where the pearl-oysters grow. They produce their eggs\r\n  in very large quantities and likewise pearls at the same time. But\r\n  it is necessary to have patience to let them grow and mature to\r\n  perfection. They are soft at the beginning like the roe of fish; and\r\n  as the mollusk gradually grows, they grow also and slowly harden.\r\n  Sometimes many are found in one shell, which are hard and small,\r\n  like gravel. Persons who have seen them while fishing say that they\r\n  are soft as long as they are in the sea, and that the hardness comes\r\n  to them only when they are out of the water. Pliny says as much,\r\n  speaking of the Orientals in Book IX, of his Natural History, ch.\r\n  35. But as to that author and Albert the Great and other writers\r\n  upon the generation of pearls, who have said that the oysters\r\n  conceive them by means of the dew which they suck in, and that\r\n  according as the dew is clear or cloudy the pearls also are\r\n  translucent or dark, etc., etc.,—all this is a little difficult to\r\n  believe; for daily observation shows that all the pearls found in\r\n  the same shell are not of the same excellence, nor of the same form,\r\n  the same perfection of color, nor the same size, as they would or\r\n  must be if they were conceived by the dew all at one time. Besides\r\n  this, in many of the islands the Indians go fishing for them in ten\r\n  or twelve fathoms depth, and in some cases they are so firmly\r\n  attached to the rocks in the sea that they can be wrenched off only\r\n  by main strength. Would it not be difficult for them to inhale the\r\n  quintessence of the air there? It seems then that it is the germ and\r\n  the most noble part of the eggs of the oyster which are converted\r\n  into pearls rather than any other thing; and the diversities of\r\n  size, color, and other qualities, proceed from the fact that some\r\n  are more advanced than others, as we see eggs in the body of the\r\n  hen.[46]\r\n\r\nThe old theory of dew-formed pearls was illustrated even as late as 1684\r\non a medal struck in honor of Elena Piscopia of the Corraro family of\r\nVenice. This bore an oyster-shell open and receiving drops of dew, and\r\nunderneath was engraved the motto “_Rore divino_” (By divine dew). Even\r\nyet one hears occasionally from out-of-the-way places—as in the instance\r\nreported by the American consul at Aden—of pearls formed from rain or\r\ndew, notwithstanding that there seems to exist absolutely no\r\njustification for it in scientific zoölogy.\r\n\r\nProbably the most popular theory entertained from the fifteenth to the\r\nseventeenth century was that pearls were formed from the eggs of the\r\noyster. This was intimated by Chauveton in the quotation above given,\r\nand it was also referred to by many naturalists.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting letter, dated Dec. 1, 1673, and giving as his\r\nauthority the testimony of an eye-witness, “Henricus Arnoldi, an\r\ningenious and veracious Dane,” Christopher Sandius wrote: “Pearl shells\r\nin Norway do breed in sweet waters; their shells are like mussels, but\r\nlarger; the fish is like an oyster, it produces clusters of eggs; these,\r\nwhen ripe, are cast out and become like those that cast them; but\r\nsometimes it appears that one or two of these eggs stick fast to the\r\nside of the matrix, and are not voided with the rest. These are fed by\r\nthe oyster against her will and they do grow, according to the length of\r\ntime, into pearls of different bigness.”[47] This possibly hit the mark\r\nwith greater accuracy than the observations of the “ingenious and\r\nveracious Dane” warranted, for he seems to have had quite a different\r\nidea as to the manner in which the pearls are “fed by the oyster against\r\nher will” from those generally entertained by naturalists at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHowever, Oliver Goldsmith settled the matter by declaring briefly:\r\n“Whether pearls be a disease or an accident in the animal is scarce\r\nworth enquiry.”[48] Thus it seems that notwithstanding all that had been\r\nwritten and the extended attention given to the subject, theory\r\nprevailed to the almost complete exclusion of practical investigation,\r\nwith little intelligent advance over Topsy’s “’spect they just growed.”\r\n\r\nOwing, doubtless, to the scarcity of pearl-bearing mollusks in their\r\nvicinities, naturalists of Europe were somewhat slow in giving attention\r\nto the origin of pearls. This is further accounted for by the fact that\r\nthe gems occur more frequently in old and diseased shells than in the\r\nchoice specimens which have naturally attracted the notice of\r\nconchologists.\r\n\r\nOne of the first of the original observations made on this subject was\r\nthat by Rondelet, who, in 1554, advanced the idea that pearls are\r\ndiseased concretions occurring in the mollusca, similar to the morbid\r\ncalculi in the mammalia.[49]\r\n\r\nThe first writer to intimate the similarity in structural material or\r\nsubstance between pearls and the interior of the shell in which they are\r\nformed, appears to have been Anselmus de Boot (_circa_ 1600), who wrote\r\nthat the pearls “are generated in the body of the creature of the same\r\nhumour of which the shell is formed; ... for whenever the little\r\ncreature is ill and hath not strength enough to belch up or expel this\r\nhumour which sticketh in the body, it becometh the rudiments of the\r\npearl; to which new humour, being added and assimilated into the same\r\nnature, begets a new skin, the continued addition of which generates a\r\npearl.”[50] The Portuguese traveler, Pedro Teixeira (1608), stated: “I\r\nhold it for certain that pearls are born of and formed of the very\r\nmatter of the shell and of nothing else. This is supported by the great\r\nresemblance of the pearl and the oyster-shell in substance and color.\r\nFurther, whatever oyster contains pearls has the flesh unsound and\r\nalmost rotten in the parts where the pearls are produced, and those\r\noysters that have no pearls are sound and clean fleshed.”[51]\r\n\r\nSomewhat more than one hundred years later, this theory was confirmed by\r\ninvestigations made by the famous physicist Réaumur (1683–1757).\r\nMicroscopic examination of cross sections of pearls show that they are\r\nbuilt up of concentric laminæ similar, except in curvature, to those\r\nforming the nacreous portion of the shell. In a paper published by the\r\nFrench Academy of Science in 1717,[52] Réaumur noted this condition, and\r\nsuggested that pearls are misplaced pieces of organized shell, and are\r\nformed from a secretion which overflows from the shell-forming organ or\r\nfrom a ruptured vessel connected therewith, and that the rupture or\r\noverflow is ordinarily produced by the intrusion of some foreign or\r\nirritating substance.\r\n\r\nSir Edwin Arnold calls attention to this theory in his beautiful lines:\r\n\r\n          Know you, perchance, how that poor formless wretch—\r\n            The Oyster—gems his shallow moonlit chalice?\r\n          Where the shell irks him, or the sea-sand frets,\r\n            He sheds this lovely lustre on his grief.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this idea, we find, in 1761, the Swedish naturalist\r\nLinnæus, “the father of natural history,” experimenting in the\r\nartificial production of pearls by the introduction of foreign bodies in\r\nthe shell, and meeting with some degree of success. His discovery was\r\nrated so highly that it has been announced by some writers as the reason\r\nwhy the great naturalist received the patent of nobility, which is\r\ngenerally supposed to have been the reward for his services to science.\r\n\r\nIt seems that Linnæus’s discovery but verified the old saying that there\r\nis nothing new under the sun, for later it was announced[53] that in\r\nChina—where so many inventions have originated—this idea had been put to\r\npractical account for centuries preceding, and the crafty Chinaman had\r\nsucceeded in producing not only small pearly objects, but even images of\r\nBuddha, with which to awe the disciples of that deified teacher.\r\n\r\nThe method consisted in slightly opening or boring through the shell of\r\nthe living mollusk and introducing against the soft body a small piece\r\nof nacre, molded metal, or other foreign matter. The irritation causes\r\nthe formation of pearly layers about the foreign body, resulting, in the\r\ncourse of months or of years, in a pearl-like growth. While these have\r\nsome value as objects of curiosity or of slight beauty, they are not\r\nchoice pearls, nor for that matter were those produced by Linnæus.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the theory of Réaumur, and also that of\r\nLinnæus, required the intrusion of some hard substance, such as a grain\r\nof sand, a particle of shell, etc., to constitute a nucleus of the\r\npearl; and this is the accepted explanation at the present time as to\r\nthe origin of many of the baroque or irregular pearls, and likewise the\r\npearly “blisters” and excrescences attached to the shell. But not so as\r\nto the choice or gem pearls, those beautiful symmetrical objects of\r\ngreat luster which are usually referred to in speaking of pearls.\r\n\r\nExaminations of many of these have failed, except in rare instances, to\r\nreveal a foreign nucleus of sand or similar inorganic substance. In\r\nsearching many fresh-water mussels, Sir Everard Home frequently met with\r\nsmall pearls in the ovarium, and he further noticed that these, as well\r\nas oriental pearls, when split into halves, often showed a brilliant\r\ncell in the center, about equal in size to the ova of the same mollusk.\r\nFrom these observations, in 1826 he deduced his “abortive ova” theory,\r\nand announced:\r\n\r\n  A pearl is formed upon the external surface of an ovum, which,\r\n  having been blighted, does not pass with the others into the\r\n  oviduct, but remains attached to its pedicle in the ovarium, and in\r\n  the following season receives a coat of nacre at the same time that\r\n  the internal surface of the shell receives its annual supply. This\r\n  conclusion is verified by some pearls being spherical, others having\r\n  a pyramidal form, from the pedicle having received a coat of nacre\r\n  as well as the ovum.[54]\r\n\r\nNaturalists generally accepted these conclusions, that pearls originate\r\nin pathological secretions formed, either as the result of the intrusion\r\nof hard substances, or by the encysting or covering of ova or other\r\nobjects of internal origin; and there was no important cleavage of\r\nopinion until the development of the parasitic theory, as a result of\r\nthe researches of the Italian naturalist Filippi, and those following\r\nhis line of investigations. This theory is not severely in conflict with\r\nthose of Réaumur, Linnæus, Home, etc., but relates principally to the\r\nidentity of the irritating or stimulating substance which forms the\r\nnucleus of the pearl.\r\n\r\nIn examining a species of fresh-water mussel, the _Anodonta cygnea_,\r\noccurring in ponds near Turin, and especially the many small pearly\r\nformations therein, Filippi observed that these were associated with the\r\npresence of a trematode or parasitic worm, which he named _Distomum\r\nduplicatum_, and which appears to be closely allied to the parasite\r\nwhich causes the fatal “rot” or distemper in sheep. Under the\r\nmicroscope, the smallest and presumably the youngest of these pearls\r\nshowed organic nuclei which appeared undoubtedly to be the remnants of\r\nthe trematode. In Anodonta from other regions, which were not infested\r\nwith the distoma, pearls were very rarely found by Filippi. In a\r\npaper,[55] published in 1852, containing a summary of his observations,\r\nhe concluded that a leading, if not the principal, cause of\r\npearl-formation in those mussels was the parasite above noted; and in\r\nlater papers[56] he included such other forms as _Atax ypsilophorus_\r\nwithin the list of parasitic agencies which might excite the\r\npearl-forming secretions, comparing their action to that of the\r\nformation of plant-galls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mexican pearl-oyster (_Margaritifera margaritifera mazatlanica_) with\r\n    adherent pearl\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Group of encysted pearls in shell of Australian pearl-oyster\r\n    (_Margaritifera maxima_)\r\n]\r\n\r\n                   American Museum of Natural History\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Mexican pearl-oyster (_Margaritifera margaritifera mazatlanica_) with\r\n    encysted fish\r\n]\r\n\r\n                   American Museum of Natural History\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Group of encysted pearls (Oriental)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Reverse of same group, showing outline of the individual pearls\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the parasitic origin of pearls was extended to the\r\npearl-oysters and to other parasites by Küchenmeister[57] in 1856, by\r\nMöbius[58] in 1857, and by several other investigators. Prominent among\r\nthese were E. F. Kelaart and his assistant Humbert, who, in 1859[59]\r\ndisclosed the important relation which the presence of vermean parasites\r\nbears to the origin of pearls in the Ceylon oysters. These naturalists\r\nfound “in addition to the Filaria and Cercaria, three other parasitical\r\nworms infesting the viscera and other parts of the pearl-oyster. We both\r\nagree that these worms play an important part in the formation of\r\npearls.” Dr. Kelaart likewise found eggs from the ovarium of the oyster\r\ncoated with nacre and forming pearls, and also suggested that the\r\nsilicious internal skeletons of microscopic diatoms might possibly\r\npermeate the mantle and become the nuclei of pearls. Unfortunately, Dr.\r\nKelaart’s investigations were terminated by his death a few months\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\nIn 1871, Garner ascribed the occurrence of pearls in the common English\r\nmussel (_Mytilus edulis_) to the presence of distomid larvæ.[60]\r\nGiard,[61] and other French zoölogists, made similar discoveries in the\r\ncase of Donax and some other bivalves. In 1901, Raphael Dubois confirmed\r\nthe observations of Garner, associating the production of pearls in the\r\nedible mussels on the French coasts with the presence of larvæ of a\r\nparasite, to which he gave the name of _Distomum margaritarum_, and\r\nboldly announced: “La plus belle perle n’est donc, en définitive, que le\r\nbrillant sarcophage d’un ver.”[62]\r\n\r\nProf. H. L. Jameson, in 1902, disclosed the relation which exists\r\nbetween pearls in English mussels (_Mytilus_) and the larvæ of _Distomum\r\nsomateriæ_.[63] The life history of this trematode, as revealed by Dr.\r\nJameson, is especially interesting from a biological standpoint, since\r\nit is entertained by three hosts at different times: the first host is a\r\nmember of the duck family; the second is the Tapes clam (_Tapes\r\ndecussatus_), or perhaps the common cockle (_Cardium edule_), which\r\nincloses the first larval stage, and the third is the edible mussel, in\r\nwhich the second larval stage of the parasite stimulates the formation\r\nof pearls. At the Brighton Aquarium and the Fish Hatchery at Kiel, Dr.\r\nJameson claims to have succeeded in artificially inoculating perfectly\r\nhealthy mussels with these parasites by associating them with infested\r\nmollusks, and thereby producing small pearls.\r\n\r\nFrom Dr. Jameson’s interesting paper we abridge the following account of\r\nthe manner in which the pearls are developed. The trematode enters\r\n_Mytilus edulis_ as a tailless cercaria, and at first may often be found\r\nbetween the mantle and the shell. The larvæ, after a while, enter the\r\nconnective tissue of the mantle, where they come to rest, assuming a\r\nspherical form, visible to the naked eye as little yellowish spots about\r\none half millimeter in diameter. At first the worm occupies only a space\r\nlined by connective-tissue fibrils, but soon the tissues of the host\r\ngive rise to an epithelial layer, which lines the space and ultimately\r\nbecomes the pearl-sac. If the trematode larva completes its maximum\r\npossible term of life, it dies, and the tissues of the body break down\r\nto form a structureless mass which retains the form of the parasite,\r\nowing to the rigid cuticle. In this mass arise one or more centers of\r\ncalcification, and the precipitation of carbonate of lime goes on until\r\nthe whole larva is converted into a nodule with calcospheritic\r\nstructure. The granular matter surrounding the worm, if present, also\r\nundergoes calcification. The epithelium of the sac then begins to shed a\r\ncuticle of conchiolin, and from this point the growth of the pearl\r\nprobably takes place on the same lines and at the same rate as the\r\nthickening of the shell.[64]\r\n\r\nFully as remarkable as the observations of Dr. Jameson are the results\r\nclaimed by Professor Dubois in experimenting with a species of\r\npearl-oyster (_M. vulgaris_) from the Gulf of Gabes on the coast of\r\nTunis, where they are almost devoid of pearls, a thousand or more shells\r\nyielding on an average only one pearl. Conveying these to the coast of\r\nFrance in 1903, he there associated them with a species of\r\ntrematode-infested mussel (_Mytilus gallo-provincialis_), and after a\r\nshort period they became so infested that every three oysters yielded an\r\naverage of two pearls.[65] This claim has not been without criticism;\r\nbut who ever knew scientists to agree?\r\n\r\nIn the pearl-oyster of the Gambier Islands (_M. margaritifera cumingi_),\r\nDr. L. G. Seurat found that the origin of pearls was due to irritation\r\ncaused by the embryo of a worm of the genus _Tylocephalum_, the life of\r\nwhich is completed in the eagle-ray, a fish which feeds on the\r\npearl-oyster.[66]\r\n\r\nIn 1903, Prof. W. A. Herdman, who, at the instance of the colonial\r\ngovernment, and with the assistance of Mr. James Hornell, examined the\r\npearl-oyster resources of Ceylon, announced: “We have found, as Kelaart\r\ndid, that in the Ceylon pearl-oyster there are several different kinds\r\nof worms commonly occurring as parasites, and we shall, I think, be able\r\nto show that Cestodes, Trematodes, and Nematodes may all be concerned in\r\npearl formation. Unlike the case of the European mussels, however, we\r\nfind that in Ceylon the most important cause is a larval Cestode of the\r\nTetrarhynchus form.”[67]\r\n\r\nIn his investigation of the Placuna oyster in 1905, Mr. James Hornell\r\nfound that the origin of pearls was due to minute larva of the same\r\nstage and species as that which causes the pearls in the Gulf of Manar\r\noyster.[68]\r\n\r\nThe spherical larvæ of this tapeworm sometimes occur in great abundance,\r\nand there is evidence of forty having been found in a single\r\npearl-oyster. Mr. Hornell states that the living worm does not induce\r\npearl formation, this occurring only when death overtakes it while in\r\ncertain parts of the oyster. As a consequence, pearls are more numerous\r\nin oysters which have been long infected, where the worms are older and\r\nmore liable to die. This parasitic worm has been traced from the\r\npearl-oyster to the trigger-fishes, which eat the pearl-oysters, and\r\nthence into certain large fish-eating rays, where it becomes sexually\r\nmature and produces embryos which enter the pearl-oyster and begin a new\r\ncycle of life-phases.\r\n\r\nIt seems, therefore, that the latest conclusions of science appear\r\nentirely favorable to the parasitic theory as explaining at least one,\r\nand probably the most important, of the causes for the formation of\r\npearls; and that some truth exists in the statement that the most\r\nbeautiful pearl is only the brilliant sarcophagus of a worm. This\r\nmorphological change is not peculiar to mollusks, for in most animal\r\nbodies a cyst is formed about in-wandering larvæ. Fortunately for lovers\r\nof the beautiful, in the pearl-oysters the character of the cyst-wall\r\nfollows that of the interior lining of the shell, and not only\r\nsimulates, but far surpasses it in luster.\r\n\r\nWhile the theory that pearls are caused by the intrusion of some unusual\r\nsubstance has the evidence of actual demonstration in many instances,\r\nand is unquestionably true to a large extent, yet microscopic\r\nexamination of some pearls suggests the theory that a foreign substance\r\nis not always essential to their formation, and that they may originate\r\nin calcareous concretions of minute size, termed “calcospherules.” As\r\nregards their origin, Professor Herdman classifies pearls into three\r\nsorts: (1) “Ampullar pearls,” which are not formed within closed sacs of\r\nthe shell-secreting epithelium like the others, but lie in pockets or\r\nampullæ of the epidermis. The nuclei may be sand-grains or any other\r\nforeign particles introduced through breaking or perforation of the\r\nshell. (2) “Muscle pearls,” which are analogous to gallstones, formed\r\naround calcospherules at or near the insertion of the muscles. And (3)\r\n“Cyst pearls,” in which concentric layers of nacre are deposited on\r\ncysts containing parasitic worms in the connective tissue of the mantle\r\nand within the soft tissues of the body.[69]\r\n\r\nEven a particle of earth, clay, or mud may form the nucleus of a pearl.\r\nThis was illustrated a few years ago in a fine button-shaped pearl,\r\nwhich was accidentally broken under normal usage and was found to\r\nconsist of a hard lump of white clay surrounded by a relatively thin\r\ncoating of nacre. More remarkable yet are the cases in which a minute\r\nfish, a crayfish, or the frustule of a diatom has formed the nucleus.\r\n\r\nSeveral instances have been described by Woodward, Gunther, Putnam,\r\nStearns, and others, where small fish have penetrated between the mantle\r\nand the shell of the mollusk, and the latter has resented the intrusion\r\nby covering the intruder with a pearly coating. In two or three\r\ninstances the secretion occurred in so short a time that the fish\r\nsuffered no appreciable decomposition, and its species is readily\r\nidentified by observation through the nacreous layer. Among the\r\nremarkable specimens of this nature which have come under our\r\nobservation are two very curious shells received in March, 1907, from\r\nthe Mexican fisheries. One of these specimens shows an encysted fish, so\r\nquickly covered and so perfectly preserved that even the scales and\r\nsmall bones are in evidence; indeed, one can almost detect the gloss on\r\nthe scales of the fish; and in the other—with a remarkable comet-like\r\nappearance—a piece of ribbed seaweed is apparently the object covered.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, it appears that the pearl is not a product of health\r\nassociated with undisturbed conditions, but results from a derangement\r\nin the normal state of the mollusk. Unable to resist, to rid itself of\r\nthe opposing evil, it exercises the powers given to it by a beneficent\r\nCreator and converts the pain into perfection, the grief into glory.\r\nNature has many instances of the humble and lowly raised to high degree,\r\nbut none more strikingly beautiful than this. One of the lowest of\r\nearth’s creatures, suffering a misfortune, furnishes a wonderful lesson\r\nupon the uses of pain and adversity by converting its affliction into a\r\nprecious gem symbolical of all that is pure and beautiful. As written by\r\na forgotten poet: “Forasmuch as the pearl is a product of life, which\r\nfrom an inward trouble and from a fault produces purity and perfection,\r\nit is preferred; for in nothing does God so much delight as in\r\ntenderness and lustre born of trouble and repentance.” As the great\r\nPersian poet Hafiz says:\r\n\r\n         Learn from yon orient shell to love thy foe,\r\n         And store with pearls the wound that brings thee woe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\n                          STRUCTURE AND FORMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n                     STRUCTURE AND FORMS OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n        “This maskellez perle that boght is dere,\r\n          The joueler gef fore alle hys gold,\r\n        Is lyke the reme of hevenes clere”;\r\n          So sayde the fader of folde and flode,\r\n        “For hit is wermlez, clene and clere,\r\n          And endelez rounde and blythe of mode,\r\n        And commune to all that ryghtwys were.”\r\n                            FOURTEENTH-CENTURY MSS. OF “PEARL,”\r\n                                  IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM.\r\n\r\nAs Kadir Munshi says, “pearls have no pedigree”; their beauty is not to\r\nbe traced to their origin, but exists wholly in the excellence of the\r\nsurroundings in which they develop.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-bearing mollusks are luxurious creatures, and for the purpose\r\nof protecting their delicate bodies they cover the interior of their\r\nshells with a smooth lustrous material, dyed with rainbow hues, and\r\npossessing a beautiful but subdued opalescence. No matter how foul, how\r\ncoral covered, or overgrown with sponges or seaweeds the exterior may\r\nbe, all is clean and beautiful within. This material is nacre or\r\nmother-of-pearl. It consists ordinarily of an accumulation of extremely\r\nthin semi-transparent films or laminæ of a granular organic substance\r\ncalled conchiolin, with the interstices filled with calcareous matter.\r\nThe nacre decreases in thickness from the hinge toward the lip of the\r\nshell, and terminates a short distance from the extreme edge.\r\n\r\nNext to the nacre is the middle layer or the shell proper. In species of\r\n_Margaritifera_, this stratum is commonly formed of layers of calcareous\r\nprisms arranged vertically to the shell surface. External to this middle\r\nor prismatic layer is the epidermis or periostracum, the rough outer\r\ncoating of varying shades, usually yellow or brown. Where the waves are\r\nrough, and the bottom hard and rocky, this covering is thick and heavy,\r\nto afford greater protection; but where the waters are smooth and\r\ngentle, and the bottom free from rocks, Nature—never working in\r\nvain—furnishes only thin sides and slight defense. As is the case with\r\nthe nacre, the prismatic layer and the periostracum decrease in\r\nthickness from the hinge to the edge, and the inside lip of the shell\r\nshows the gradual union of the three superimposed layers. The two outer\r\nlayers are formed by the thick edge of the mantle, the remaining\r\nportion—or nearly the entire surface—of this organ secretes the nacral\r\nlayer.\r\n\r\nNot only is the interior of the shell made lustrous and beautiful, but\r\nthis tendency is exerted toward all objects that come in contact with\r\nthe soft body of the mollusk, either by intrusion simply within the\r\nshell, or deeply within the organs and tissues of the animal itself. All\r\nforeign bodies—such as small parasites, diatoms, minute pebbles,\r\netc.,—irritate the tender tissues of the mollusk, and stimulate the\r\npearly formation which in course of time covers them. At first the\r\nnacreous covering is very thin; but with added layer after layer the\r\nthickness is enhanced, and the size of the object increases as long as\r\nit remains undisturbed and the mollusk is in healthful growth.\r\n\r\nChemically considered, aside from the nucleus, the structure of pearls\r\nis identical in composition with that of the nacre of the shell in which\r\nthey are formed. Analyses have shown that those from the fresh-water\r\nmussels of England and Scotland, and from the pearl-oysters of Australia\r\nand of Ceylon, have nearly identical composition in the proportion of\r\nabout 5.94 per cent. of organic matter, 2.34 of water, and 91.72 per\r\ncent. of carbonate of lime.[70] The specific gravity ranges from nearly\r\n2 to about 2.75, increasing with the deposit of the nacreous coatings.\r\nThe following summary by Von Hessling[71] shows the results of certain\r\ndeterminations of specific gravity:\r\n\r\n  Authority   Specific                       Note\r\n              Gravity\r\n\r\n Muschenbroet  2.750   at moderate temperature\r\n\r\n Brisson       2.684   at 14° Réaumur\r\n\r\n Möbius        2.686   4 fine pearls, weighing 2.396 gms.\r\n\r\n Möbius        2.650   24 pearls, weighing 6.221 gms.\r\n\r\n Möbius        2.336   63 brown pearls from Mazatlan, weighing 4.849\r\n                         gms.\r\n\r\n Voit          2.722   Bavarian pearls, 3–3⁄16 carats, medium quality\r\n\r\n Voit          2.616   Bavarian pearls, 3⅝ carats, finer quality\r\n\r\n Voit          2.724   Bavarian pearls, 1¾ carats, very fine\r\n\r\n Voit          2.578   Bavarian pearls, gray, with some luster\r\n\r\n Voit          2.765   Bavarian pearls, brown, ranking between good &\r\n                         black\r\n\r\n Voit          2.238   Bavarian pearls, poor black pearls, impure\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cross section of an irregular pearl, magnified 80 diameters\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cross sections of pearls, magnified 30 diameters\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Thin section of mother-of-pearl, magnified, showing sponge borings\r\n    which traversed the pearl shell\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Structure of conch pearl produced by fracturing, magnified 80\r\n    diameters\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe distinctive characteristic, the great beauty of a true pearl, is its\r\nluster or orient, which is a subdued iridescence, rather than the\r\nglittering brilliance of the diamond; and unless the shelly growth be\r\nlustrous it does not rank as a gem pearl, no matter how perfect its form\r\nor beautiful its color. This luster is due to the structural arrangement\r\nof the surface as well as to the quality of the material. The nacreous\r\nmaterial forming true pearls, and likewise mother-of-pearl, is commonly\r\ndeposited in irregular tenuous layers, very thin and very small in area\r\ncompared with the surface of the pearl. These laminæ overlap one\r\nanother, the surfaces are microscopically crumpled and corrugated, and\r\nthe edges form serrated outlines. The greater the angle which the laminæ\r\nform with the surface, the closer will be these serrated outlines, and\r\nwhere the plane of the exterior lamina is parallel with the plane of the\r\nsurface the lines are not present. This arrangement causes the waves of\r\nlight to be reflected from different levels on the surface, just as in a\r\nsoap bubble, and the minute prisms split the rays up into their colored\r\nconstituents, producing the chromatic or iridescent effect.\r\n\r\nThe cause is wholly mechanical, and an impression of the surface made in\r\nvery fine wax shows a similar iridescence. Also, if a piece of\r\nmother-of-pearl be immersed in acid until the surface lime or shelly\r\nmatter is dissolved, the pellucid membrane shows the iridescence until\r\nit is so compressed that the corrugations are reduced. About two score\r\nyears ago an Englishman invented steel buttons with similar minute\r\ncorrugations producing pearly effect, but the manufacture was\r\nunprofitable, owing, principally, to their liability to tarnish.\r\n\r\nIn the shells of some mollusks—as the edible oysters (_Ostrea_) or the\r\ngiant clam (_Tridacna_),—there is almost a total absence of the crumpled\r\ncorrugated laminæ, and, consequently, there is little luster. In others\r\nthe nacre is of better quality, resulting in superior orient, and it\r\nprobably reaches its highest degree of perfection in the pearl-oyster\r\n(_Margaritifera_).\r\n\r\nAs the curvature of the surface of pearls is greater, and the minute\r\nstriæ are more numerous, than in ordinary mother-of-pearl, it follows\r\nthat the iridescence is likewise greater.\r\n\r\nSuperior nacre is more or less translucent, depending on its quality;\r\nand to the iridescence of the outer laminæ is added that of many\r\ninterior ones, so that the luster is vastly increased. The position of\r\nthe pearl within the shell may greatly affect the quality of the\r\nmaterial and, consequently, the orient. The choicest are commonly found\r\nwithin the soft parts of the animal, and those of poorer quality are at\r\nthe edges of the mantle, or within the fibers of the adductor muscle of\r\nbivalves.\r\n\r\nThe structure of pearls may be studied by examining thin cross sections\r\nunder the microscope, or by transmitted polarized light. It appears that\r\nordinarily a pearl is made up of many independent laminæ superimposed\r\none upon another “like the layers of an onion,” or, rather, resembling\r\nthe leaves near the upper part of a well formed cabbage. When subjected\r\nto sufficient heat, the laminæ separate from each other, as do shells of\r\nedible oysters and similar mollusks under like conditions. When broken\r\nby a hammer, a pearl may exhibit this laminated formation. If not split\r\ndirectly through the center, the central section may retain the\r\nspherical form; and as this commonly remains attached to one of the\r\nparts, its concave impression appears in the other portion of the broken\r\npearl. The outer laminæ of many pearls may be removed with a fair\r\nprospect of finding a good subjacent surface, and this may be continued\r\nuntil the size is greatly reduced. These laminæ are not always similar\r\nin color or luster.\r\n\r\nHowever, not all pearls are laminated in this manner. Instead of\r\nsuperimposed layers, some of them exhibit a crystalline form, composed\r\nof beautiful prismatic crystals radiating from the center to the\r\ncircumference. In at least one oriental pearl examined, these crystals\r\nwere in well defined arcs, and were further separated into concentric\r\nrings of different degrees of thickness, depth of color, and distance\r\napart. Another specimen—a Scotch pearl—combined in separate layers both\r\nthe laminated form and the crystalline structure.\r\n\r\nDr. Harley points out that some crystalline pearls apparently originate\r\nin mere coalescences of mineral particles, rather than in well defined\r\nnuclei.[72] Microscopic sections of crystalline pearls convey the idea\r\nthat the prisms branch and interlace with one another, and also that in\r\nsome instances they are of fusiform shape. However, these appearances\r\nseem to be due simply to the cross sections having cut the prisms at\r\ndifferent angles.\r\n\r\nPearls showing these types were exhibited at a meeting of the Royal\r\nSociety of London, June 8, 1887. That exhibit also contained a section\r\nof a west Australian pearl of curiously complex crystalline formation;\r\ninstead of one central starting-point, it had more than a dozen\r\nscattered about, from which the crystalline prisms radiated in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nSince the three superimposed layers of the shell are secreted by\r\nseparate parts of the mantle, _viz._, the nacre by the general surface,\r\nthe prismatic layer by the inner edge, and the epidermis by the outer\r\nedge, it follows that if a pearl in course of formation is moved from\r\none of these distinctive portions of the palial organ to another, the\r\nnature of its laminæ changes. Thus, if a pearl formed on the broad\r\nsurface of the mantle is moved in some way to the inner edge of that\r\norgan, it may be covered with a prismatic layer; if then moved to the\r\nouter edge it may receive a lamina of epidermis, and then by changing\r\nagain to the broad surface of the mantle it receives further coats of\r\nnacre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pearls from common clam (_Venus mercenaria_) of eastern coast of\r\n    America\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pearl “nuggets” from the Mississippi Valley\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Wing pearls from the Mississippi Valley\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Dog-tooth pearls from the Mississippi Valley\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe structure of pearls from univalve mollusks, such as the conch, the\r\nabalone, etc., as well as those from some bivalves, as the Pinna, for\r\ninstance, differs from that of the true pearls formed in species of\r\nMargaritifera. Instead of the alternate layers of conchiolin and of\r\ncarbonate of lime, many of these have an alveolar structure. When\r\ngreatly magnified, the surface of a Pinna pearl appears to be formed of\r\nvery small polygones, which, as decalcification shows, are the bases of\r\nsmall pyramids radiating from the nucleus. The walls of these pyramids\r\nare formed of conchiolin, and they are filled with carbonate of lime of\r\na prismatic crystalline structure. This is simply a modification of the\r\nparallel laminæ in the Margaritifera pearls, for, as Dubois points out,\r\nin some sections we can see portions where the alveolar formation has\r\nproceeded for a time coincidentally with the lamellar form.\r\n\r\nPearls are affected by acids and fetid gases, and may be calcined on\r\nexposure to heat. Their solubility in vinegar was referred to by the\r\nRoman architect Vitruvius (“De Architectura,” L. viii. c. 3) and also by\r\nPausanias, a Greek geographer in the second century (“Hellados\r\nPeriegesis,” L. viii, c. 18); but it seems that there could be little\r\nfoundation for Pliny’s well-known anecdote in which Cleopatra is\r\ncredited with dissolving a magnificent pearl in vinegar and drinking\r\nit—“the ransom of a kingdom at a draught”—to the health of her lover\r\nAntony.[73] It is no more easy to dissolve a pearl in vinegar than it is\r\nto dissolve a pearl-button—for the composition is similar, and one may\r\neasily experiment for himself as to the difficulty in doing this. Not\r\nonly does it take many days to dissolve in cold vinegar the mineral\r\nelements of a pearl of fair size, but even with boiling vinegar it\r\nrequires several hours to extract the mineral matter from one four or\r\nfive grains in weight, the acid penetrating to the interior very slowly.\r\nAnd in neither case can the pearl be made to disappear, for even after\r\nthe carbonate of lime has dissolved, the organic matrix of animal\r\nmatter—which is insoluble in vinegar—retains almost the identical shape,\r\nsize, and appearance as before. If the pearl is first pulverized, it\r\nbecomes readily soluble in vinegar, and might be thus drunk as a lover’s\r\npotion, but it would scarcely prove a _bonne bouche_.\r\n\r\nPearls assume an almost infinite variety of forms, due largely to the\r\nshapes of the nuclei, and also to their positions within the mollusk.\r\nThe most usual—and, fortunately, also the most valuable—is the\r\nspherical, resulting from a very minute or a round body as a nucleus and\r\nthe uniform addition of nacre on all sides. Of course, spherical pearls\r\ncan result only where they are quite free from other hard substances;\r\nconsequently they originate only in the soft parts of the mollusk and\r\nnot by the fixation of some nucleus to the interior surface of the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe perfectly spherical pearls range in weight from a small fraction of\r\na grain to three hundred grains or more, but it is very, very rare that\r\none of choice luster weighs more than one hundred grains. The largest of\r\nwhich we have any specific information was that among the French crown\r\njewels as early as the time of Napoleon, an egg-shaped pearl, weighing\r\n337 grains. The largest pearl known to Pliny in the first century A.D.\r\nweighed “half a Roman ounce and one scruple over,” or 234½ grains Troy.\r\nThese very large ones, weighing in excess of one hundred grains, are\r\ncalled “paragons.” The small pearls—weighing less than half a grain\r\neach—are known as “seed-pearls.” The very small ones, weighing less than\r\n1⁄25 of a grain, are called “dust-pearls.” These are too small to be of\r\neconomic value as ornaments.\r\n\r\nSlight departures from the perfect sphere, result in egg shapes, pear\r\nshapes, drop shapes, pendeloque, button shapes, etc. Some of these are\r\nvalued quite as highly at the present time as the spherical pearls, and\r\nmany of the most highly prized pearls in the world are of other than\r\nspherical form. Indeed, pearls of this kind are found of larger size\r\nthan the perfectly round pearls. The egg-shaped pearl,[74] called “la\r\nRégente,”—one of the French crown jewels sold in May, 1887—weighed, as\r\nstated above, 337 grains. The great pear pearl described by\r\nTavernier—“the largest ever discovered”—weighed about 500 grains. A\r\nbutton pearl received from Panama in 1906 weighed 216 grains.\r\n\r\nWider departures from the spherical form result in cylindrical, conical,\r\ntop-shaped, etc. Some pearls present the appearance of having been\r\nturned in a lathe with intricate tooling. Remarkable examples of these\r\n“turned pearls” have been found, competing in their circular perfection\r\nwith the best work of a jeweler’s lathe.\r\n\r\nMany standard varieties of non-spherical, but normally shaped pearls,\r\nare recognized by the fishermen and the jewelers. For instance, in the\r\nnomenclature of the American fishermen, _bouton_, or button pearls are\r\ndivided into “haystacks” and “turtle-backs,” according to the height of\r\nthe projection. Also, certain imperfections result in distinguishing\r\nnames: “bird’s-eye” refers to a pearl having a little imperfection on\r\nthe best surface; “ring-arounds” have a dark or discolored ring about\r\nthem; and “strawberries” have numerous minute projections on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nDuring its growth, a spherical pearl may come in contact with a foreign\r\nbody, such as grit or a vegetable film, and the additional nacral layers\r\nenvelop the adjacent matter until it is entirely concealed within the\r\npearl, its position being recognized only by the excrescence on one\r\nside, and, with continued increase in size, even this may be almost\r\novercome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ACTUAL SIZES OF PEARLS FROM ⅛ GRAIN TO 160 GRAINS\r\n]\r\n\r\nSometimes double, triple, or multiple pearls are formed; each of these\r\nmay have a separate nucleus and grow independently for a time until they\r\nadjoin each other; continuing to grow, they become so united as to form\r\na connected mass. The “Southern Cross” is a remarkable example of this.\r\nIt appears to consist of seven nearly spherical pearls attached to one\r\nanother in a straight line, and one projecting from each side of the\r\nsecond in the row, thus forming a Roman cross.[75]\r\n\r\nA few years ago, near Sharks Bay, on the coast of western Australia, a\r\ncluster was found containing about 150 pearls closely compacted. This\r\ncluster measured about one and a half inches in length, three quarters\r\nof an inch in breadth, and half an inch in thickness.\r\n\r\nWhen a growing pearl is very near to the nacreous lining of the shell,\r\nthe pressure between the two hard substances results in a rupture of the\r\npearl-forming sac and the epithelial layer of the shell, and the pearl\r\ncomes in actual contact with the nacre. The pearl gradually becomes\r\nattached to the shell, and the under portion is prevented from growing\r\nfurther; the upper or exposed surface receives other layers, resulting\r\nin the formation of a _bouton_. As the shell around the pearl continues\r\nto grow, it gradually closes about, and almost wholly conceals the\r\npearl. Since it is constantly wasting away on the exterior surface as it\r\ngrows on the interior, it follows that in time the shell passes the\r\npearl quite through to the outside, where it rapidly decays. Thus the\r\noyster virtually forces the annoying intruder directly through the wall\r\nof its house instead of by way of the open door, and magically closes\r\nthe breach with its marvelous masonry.\r\n\r\nThese embedded pearls are generally faulty and of diminished luster,\r\nbut in the aggregate, large quantities of imperfect ones, and\r\nespecially half and quarter pearls, are secured in this manner.\r\nSometimes—particularly in the Australian fisheries—large pearls are\r\nthus found, weighing twenty, forty, sixty, and even eighty grains; and\r\nwhen the faulty outside layers of nacre are removed, a subjacent\r\nsurface of fine luster may possibly be revealed. In bivalves, these\r\nadherent pearls are commonly in the deep or lower valve, except in\r\nthose unusual cases where the mollusks have been lying in a reverse\r\nposition. At the fisheries, the surfaces of the shells are carefully\r\ninspected for evidence of pearly nodules, and these are broken open in\r\nsearch for encysted objects. Cutters of mother-of-pearl occasionally\r\nfind embedded pearls of this kind which have escaped the vigilant eyes\r\nof the fishermen.\r\n\r\nWe read of an instance in an important paper treating of the jeweling\r\ntrade of Birmingham: “A few years since [the paper was written in 1866]\r\na small lot of shells was brought to Birmingham, which either from\r\nignorance or mistake had not been cleared of the pearls at the fishery.\r\nA considerable number were found and sold, and one especially was sold\r\nby the man who had bought the shell for working into buttons, for £40.\r\nThe purchaser, we believe, resold the same for a profit of £160; and we\r\nhave heard that it was afterward held in Paris for sale at £800.”\r\n\r\nA choice gem which was found in New York, in October, 1905, in an\r\nAustralian shell, sold finally for $1200.\r\n\r\nThe intrusion and continued presence of grains of sand or similar\r\nmaterial between the mantle and the shell causes the formation of nacre\r\nover the foreign body, resulting in a _chicot_ (blister pearl), or\r\npossibly a quarter or a half-pearl. The growth of a _chicot_ sometimes\r\nresults from the mollusk covering a choice pearl which has become\r\nloosened from the soft tissues and adheres to the shell, as above cited.\r\nHence, it is sometimes desirable to break a _chicot_ to secure its more\r\nvaluable inclosure. In the account of his interesting pearling\r\nexperiences on the Australian coast, Henry Taunton states: “During the\r\nfirst season’s shelling at Roebuck Bay, we came across an old worm-eaten\r\nshell containing a large blister, which was removed in the usual manner\r\nby punching a ring of minute holes around its base; a slight tap was\r\nthen sufficient to detach it. For many weeks it was untouched, no one\r\ncaring to risk opening it, for if filled with black ooze, which is\r\nfrequently the case, it would be of little value. At last, baffled in\r\nhis attempt to solve the problem, and emboldened by an overdose of\r\n‘square face,’ the skipper gave it a smart blow with a hammer, which\r\ncracked it open, and out rolled a huge pearl, nearly perfect, and\r\nweighing eighty grains. A few specks and discolorations were removed by\r\na skilful ‘pearl-faker,’ and it was sold in London for £1500.”[76]\r\n\r\nBlister pearls are also caused by the defensive or protective action of\r\nthe mollusk in resisting the intrusion of some animal, as a boring\r\nsponge or a burrowing worm, which has begun to penetrate the outer\r\nlayers of the shell. This stimulation causes the mollusk to pile\r\nnacreous material upon the spot, thus making a substantial mound closely\r\nresembling a segment of a large pearl. This walling-out of intruders is\r\nnot the result of intelligent forethought or of instinct, analogous to\r\nthe repairing of a damaged web by a spider, or the retunneling of a\r\ncollapsed gallery by ants; it is a pathological rather than an\r\nintelligent action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BROOCHES MADE OF PETAL, DOG-TOOTH, AND WING PEARLS\r\n\r\n  From the Upper Mississippi Valley\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the nucleus of a pearl is large and very irregular, it necessarily\r\nfollows that the deposited nacre roughly assumes the irregular outline\r\nof the inclosed object. This is strikingly shown in pearls covering a\r\nminute fish, a crayfish, or a small crab. Several specimens have been\r\nfound in which the species could be identified by examination through\r\nthe nacreous coating.\r\n\r\nIn the American Unios there is a strong tendency to produce elongated\r\npearls near the hinge of the shell, which are consequently known as\r\n“hinge pearls.” The occurrence and form of these suggest that their\r\norigin may not be due to nuclei, but that they result from an excess of\r\ncarbonate of lime in the water, and that the animal stores a surplus of\r\nnacre in this convenient form. There are several standard forms of these\r\nhinge pearls. Many are elongated or dog-toothed, some are hammer-shaped,\r\nothers resemble the wings of birds, the petals of flowers, the bodies of\r\nfish, and various other objects. A large percentage of the pearls found\r\nin Unios of the Mississippi Valley are of these types.\r\n\r\nSome irregular pearls or baroques are very large, weighing an ounce or\r\nmore. A well-known example is the Hope pearl, described on page 463,\r\nwhich weighs three ounces. These monster pearls sometimes assume odd\r\nshapes, such as clasped hands, the body of a man, lion, or other animal,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nAlthough baroques may have a pearly luster, they are not highly prized\r\nunless unusually attractive, and they have little permanent value, apart\r\nfrom their estimation in the eyes of admirers of the curious and unique.\r\nThey are used largely in _l’art nouveau_, and in forming odd and\r\nfanciful objects of jewelry, the designer taking advantage of the\r\nresemblance which they bear to common objects of every-day life, and by\r\nadditions of gold and other ornaments completing the form which nature\r\nhad merely suggested.\r\n\r\nSome remarkable examples of baroque mountings have been produced, and a\r\nfew are to be found in most of the large pearl collections. In a single\r\ncase in the Imperial Treasury at Vienna are baroques forming the\r\nprincipal parts or figures of a horse, stag, lamb, tortoise, lizard,\r\ncock, dragon, butterfly, gondola, hippopotamus, female bust, and three\r\nmermaids. Other well-known collections are those of the royal family of\r\nSaxony in the Grüne Gewölbe at Dresden; those in the Palace of Rosenberg\r\nat Copenhagen; in the Waddesden (Rothschild) collection of the British\r\nMuseum; among the jewels in the Louvre in Paris; with the treasures of\r\nthe Basilica of St. Mark in Venice; and in the museum of the University\r\nof Moscow.\r\n\r\nA remarkable pearl-like ornament more common in Asia than in the\r\nOccident, is the _coque de perle_, which is an oval section of the\r\nglobose whorl of the Indian nautilus. The exterior or convex surface is\r\nhighly lustrous, but the material is very thin. It is commonly provided\r\nwith a suitable filling or backing of putty or cement to impart\r\nsolidity, and is used like a blister pearl. Sometimes two perfectly\r\nmatched _coques de perle_ are filled and cemented together, giving the\r\nappearance of an abnormally large oblong or nearly spherical pearl.\r\n\r\nThe color of pearls has no connection with the luster. In general it is\r\nthe same as that of the shell in which they are formed. Black pearls are\r\nfound in the black shells of Mexico, and pink pearls in the pink-hued\r\n_Strombus_ of the Bahamas. Ceylon pearls are seldom of any other color\r\nthan white, and Sharks Bays are almost invariably quite yellow or\r\nstraw-colored, while those of Venezuela are commonly yellowish tinged.\r\nBut from other localities, pearls simulate every tint of the rainbow, as\r\nwell as white and black. The most common, as well as the most desirable\r\nordinarily, is white, or rather, silvery or moonlight glint,—“_la gran\r\nMargherita_,” as Dante calls it; but yellow, pink, and black are\r\nnumerous. They may also be piebald—a portion white and the rest pink or\r\nbrown or black. Some years ago there was on the market a large\r\nbean-shaped pearl of great luster, one half of which was white and the\r\nother quite black, the dividing-line being sharply defined in the plane\r\nof the greatest circumference. The pearls from Mexico, the South Sea\r\nislands, and the American rivers are especially noted for their great\r\nvariety of coloration, covering every known tint and shade, and\r\nrequiring such a master as Théophile Gautier to do justice to them.\r\n\r\nMany theories have been advanced to explain the coloration of pearls.\r\nWhen the old idea of dew formation prevailed, it was considered that\r\nwhite pearls were formed in fair weather, and the dark ones when the\r\nweather was cloudy. It was further considered that the color was\r\ninfluenced by the depth of the water in which they grew: that in deep\r\nwater they were white, but where it was so shallow that the sunlight\r\neasily penetrated, the pearls were more likely to be dark in color.\r\nTavernier curiously explained that the black pearls of Panama and Mexico\r\nowed their color to the black mud in which the pearl-oysters of those\r\nlocalities lived, and that Persian Gulf pearls were more inclined to\r\nyellow than those of Ceylon, owing to the greater putrefaction of the\r\nflesh before they were removed therefrom.[77] Two centuries ago the\r\ncolor of a pearl was attributed to that of the central nucleus, and it\r\nwas concluded that if the nucleus was dark, the pearl would be of a\r\nsimilar hue.[78] This theory has also been upset, for pearls are found\r\nwhite on the exterior and quite dark within, and also with these\r\nconditions reversed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRAY PEARLS IN THE POSSESSION OF AN AMERICAN LADY AND BROOCH FROM\r\n    TIFFANY & CO.’S EXHIBIT, PARIS EXPOSITION, 1900\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe color of a pearl is determined by that of the conchiolin, as appears\r\nfrom its remaining unchanged after decalcification. While generally it\r\nis the same as that of the mother-of-pearl at the corresponding point of\r\nthe shell in which it is formed, there are many exceptions to this, and\r\nthe reasons for the varying tints and colors are probably to be found in\r\nthe changes in position of the pearl, the ingredients of the water, the\r\nhealth of the mollusk, accidents of various kinds, etc. These factors\r\nwill be referred to later in discussing the pearls from different\r\nmollusks and regions; but in general it is no more easy to explain the\r\ncolors of pearls than it is to say why one rose is white and another is\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nMedieval writers had much to say regarding unripe or immature pearls,\r\nlikening them to eggs in the body of a hen, which follow a uniform rate\r\nof growth; and this idea is not entirely absent even in contemporaneous\r\nwritings. However, it is an interesting fact that the humble mollusks,\r\nlike the five wise virgins with prepared lamps, keep their gems perfect\r\nin beauty and luster at all times. It matters not whether the pearl be\r\nremoved when it is only the size of a pinhead or not until it reaches\r\nthat of a marble, it is at all times a complete, a ripe, a perfect\r\npearl, and the largest surpasses the smallest only in the\r\ncharacteristics and properties which are incidental to size. Imparting\r\nperfection and completion every day, every moment, the mollusk utilizes\r\nthe added time simply in enlarging its beautiful work.\r\n\r\nAlthough art has made wonderful progress in that direction, the pearl,\r\nlike truth, is not easily imitated. There is as much difference between\r\nthe ubiquitous imitations and the perfect gem as there is between a\r\nchromolithograph and a silvery Corot, or between the effects of\r\ncosmetics and the freshness of youth. While to the unskilled, or under\r\nsuperficial inspection, the false has some of the properties of the\r\ngenuine, it is only necessary to place them side by side to make the\r\ndifference apparent. However clever the imitation may be in color, in\r\nform, and in density, it always lacks in richness, in sweetness, and in\r\nblended iridescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\n                           SOURCES OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n                           SOURCES OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n  Rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house, as your\r\n  pearl in your foul oyster.\r\n\r\n                                       _As You Like It_, Act V, sc. 4.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn geographic range, the sources of pearls are widely distributed, each\r\none of the six continents yielding its quota; but the places where\r\nprofitable fisheries are prosecuted are restricted in area. First in\r\npoint of value, and possibly of antiquity also, are the fisheries of the\r\nPersian Gulf, giving employment ordinarily to thirty thousand or more\r\ndivers. The yield in the likewise ancient fisheries of the Gulf of\r\nManaar is uncertain, but sometimes remarkably large. The Red Sea\r\nresources are now of slight importance compared with their extent in the\r\ntime of the Ptolemies. Other Asiatic fisheries are in the Gulf of Aden,\r\nabout Mergui Archipelago, on the coast of China, Japan, Korea, and Siam,\r\nand also in the rivers of China, Manchuria, and Siberia.\r\n\r\nAside from those produced in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, the pearl\r\nfisheries of Africa are of small extent. Some reefs exist on the lower\r\ncoast of the German East African territory and also in Portuguese East\r\nAfrica, but they have not been thoroughly exploited.\r\n\r\nIn most of the inshore waters of Australasia pearls may be secured; the\r\nfisheries are most extensive on the northern coast of Australia, in the\r\nSulu Archipelago, and about the Dutch East Indies. Tuamotu Archipelago,\r\nGambier, Fiji, and Penrhyn are prominent in the South Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn the seas of Europe few pearls have been found, but the rivers have\r\nyielded many; and although the resources have been greatly impaired,\r\nmany beautiful gems are yet found there.\r\n\r\nSouth America contributes the important reefs on the coast of\r\nVenezuela—the land of unrest and revolutions, whose fisheries were first\r\nexploited by Columbus. Other South American countries in which pearls\r\nare collected are Panama, Ecuador, Peru, etc. In North America, pearls\r\nare found in the pearl-oyster of the Gulf of California, the abalone of\r\nthe Pacific coast, the queen conch of the Gulf of Mexico, and in the\r\nUnios of most of the rivers, especially those of the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\nSince pearly concretions partake of the characteristics of the shell\r\nwithin which they are formed, it follows that practically all species of\r\nmollusks whose shells have a well-developed nacreous lining yield pearls\r\nto a greater or less extent. But the number of these species is\r\nrelatively small. They belong chiefly to the _Margaritiferæ_, or\r\npearl-oyster family of the sea, and to the _Unionidæ_, or family of\r\nfresh-water mussels. Pearls occur also in some univalves, but not so\r\nabundantly as in bivalves of the families mentioned. Broadly stated, we\r\nmay hope to find pearls within any mollusk whose shell possesses a\r\nnacreous surface; and it is useless to search for them in shells whose\r\ninterior is dull and opaque, such as the edible oyster for instance.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the pearls on the market, and likewise those of the\r\nhighest quality, are from the _Margaritiferæ_, which are widely\r\ndistributed about tropical waters. Although these mollusks are spoken of\r\nas pearl-oysters, they are not related in any way to the edible oysters\r\n(_Ostrea_) of America and Europe.[79] The flesh is fat and glutinous,\r\nand so rank in flavor as to be almost unfit for food, although eaten at\r\ntimes by the poorer fishermen in lieu of better fare. The origin of the\r\nname is doubtless due to the fact that in the somewhat circular form of\r\nthe shell they resemble oysters rather than the elongated mussels of\r\nEurope, to which they are more nearly related in anatomy. Also in\r\nthat—like their namesakes—they are monomyarian, having only one adductor\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\nThe two valves or sides of the pearl-oyster shell are nearly similar in\r\nshape and almost equal in size; whereas in the edible oysters one valve\r\nis thin and somewhat flat, while the other is thicker, larger, and\r\nhighly convex. In the latter, also, the hinge, or umbo, is an angular\r\nbeak; but in the pearl-oysters the umbo is prolonged by so-called ears\r\nor wings into a straight line the length of which is nearly equal to the\r\nbreadth of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe byssus, or bunch of fibers, by which pearl-oysters attach themselves\r\nto the bottom indicates their relationship to the mussels. The\r\npossession of a small foot and somewhat extended migratory powers—at\r\nleast in the first years of growth—also distinguish them from the\r\nsedentary edible oysters. But from an economic point of view, the\r\nprincipal difference is the possession of a thick, nacreous, interior\r\nlining in the shells of pearl-oysters, which is wholly lacking in the\r\nedible species. Like their namesakes, the pearl-oysters are exceedingly\r\nfertile, a single specimen numbering its annual increase by millions.\r\n\r\nCommercially considered, the pearl-oysters are roughly divisible into\r\ntwo groups, (1) those fished exclusively for the pearls which they\r\ncontain, and (2) those whose shells are so thick as to give them\r\nsufficient value to warrant their capture independently of the yield of\r\npearls. The best examples of the first group are the pearl-oysters of\r\nCeylon and of Venezuela, and to a less extent those of the Persian Gulf,\r\nthe coast of Japan, and of Sharks Bay, on the Australian coast. Of the\r\nsecond group, the pearl-oysters of Torres Straits and of the Malay\r\nArchipelago are the most prominent members. Between these two groups are\r\nthe many species and varieties whose shells and pearls are more evenly\r\ndivided with respect to value, including those of Mexico, Panama, the\r\nRed Sea, the South Sea islands, etc.\r\n\r\nSome conchologists recognize a large number of species of\r\n_Margaritiferæ_, while other authorities consider many of these as local\r\nvariations of the same species. There is much difference in the size,\r\ncolor, and markings of the shells in different localities, owing to\r\nvarying geographical and physical conditions. The distinction of species\r\nand the nomenclature herein adopted are those of Dr. H. L. Jameson, who\r\nhas recently revised and rearranged the collection of shells belonging\r\nto this family in the British Museum of Natural History,[80] and to whom\r\nwe are indebted for descriptive notes relative to several of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe greatest pearl-producer in the family of pearl-oysters is the\r\n_Margaritifera vulgaris_ of the Gulf of Manaar and the Persian Gulf, and\r\nto a much less extent of the Red Sea. It occurs in various other inshore\r\nwaters of the Indian Ocean, and about the Malay Archipelago and the\r\ncoast of Australia and New Guinea, although it is not the principal\r\npearl-oyster of those waters. An interesting account of its immigration\r\ninto the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal was given by Vassel in\r\n1896.[81]\r\n\r\nThis species is quite small, averaging two and a half inches in diameter\r\nin Ceylon waters, and somewhat more in the Persian Gulf, whence large\r\nquantities of the shell are exported under the name of “Lingah shell.”\r\nThe Ceylon variety has the nacreous lining almost uniformly white over\r\nthe entire surface, only the lip having a slightly pinkish ground color.\r\nThe exterior is marked by seven or eight reddish brown radial bands on a\r\npale yellow ground. In addition to its greater size, the Persian variety\r\nis darker, and the lip of the shell has a reddish tinge.\r\n\r\nFor centuries the _Margaritifera vulgaris_ has sustained the great pearl\r\nfisheries of Ceylon, India, and Persia, and at present yields the bulk\r\nof pearls on the market, especially the seed-pearls and also those of\r\nmedium size. It produces relatively few large ones, rarely exceeding\r\ntwelve grains in weight. These pearls are commonly silvery white, and\r\nfor their size command the highest prices, because of their beautiful\r\nform and superior luster. Excepting the Venezuelan species, this is the\r\nonly pearl-oyster which at present supports extensive fisheries\r\nexclusively for pearls; in the fisheries for all other species the value\r\nof the shells furnishes considerable revenue, and in some localities\r\nthis represents several times as much as the income from the pearls.\r\n\r\nRanking next to _Margaritifera vulgaris_ in extent of pearl production\r\nis the _Margaritifera margaritifera_, which is widely distributed about\r\nthe tropical inshore waters of the Pacific and Indian oceans. It is very\r\nmuch larger than the Lingah oyster, good specimens measuring seven or\r\neight inches in diameter, and the nacreous interior is usually of a\r\ndarker color. In addition to its yield of pearls, the shell of this\r\nspecies is of value in the mother-of-pearl trade, and contributes\r\nlargely to the economic results of the fisheries. Indeed, in several\r\nregions the shell is of more value than the pearls, which represent only\r\nan incidental yield. As Jameson notes, the color and markings of the\r\nshell, though extremely variable, generally suffice to distinguish this\r\nspecies. The ground color of the exterior ranges through various shades\r\nfrom yellowish brown to very dark brown. Its characteristic markings\r\nconsist of from ten to eighteen radial rows of white and yellow spots,\r\nrunning from the umbo, or hinge, to the margin.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of _Margaritifera margaritifera_ are recognized. The\r\ntype species occurs along the north coast of Australia, from Brisbane on\r\nthe east to Sharks Bay on the west; on the New Guinea coast; at Formosa;\r\nand about many of the islands of the Pacific. The well-known “black lip\r\nshell” of Australian waters is of this species; it shows a greenish\r\nblack on the margin of the nacre. The yield of this is very small\r\ncompared with that of the large pearl-oyster of Australia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SHELL OF PEARL-OYSTER WITH ATTACHED PEARL\r\n\r\n  (_Margaritifera margaritifera mazatlanica_)\r\n\r\n  From Costa Rica\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe _Margaritifera margaritifera_ occurs on the eastern coast of Arabia\r\nin two varieties, which differ somewhat from the type species. These\r\nhave been designated by Jameson as _M. margaritifera persica_ and _M.\r\nmargaritifera erythræensis_. These are much larger than the Lingah shell\r\nof the Persian Gulf, but are smaller than the Australian species. The\r\npercentage of pearls in them is less than in the Lingah species, but\r\nfrom a commercial point of view this is to some extent offset by the\r\ngreater value of the shell. The _M. m. persica_ is more numerous in the\r\ngulf than the _M. m. erythræensis_, and large quantities of the shell\r\nare marketed in Europe. Formerly the shipments were made principally by\r\nway of Bombay, hence the shell is known in the mother-of-pearl trade as\r\n“Bombay shell.” The exterior is of a light grayish or greenish brown\r\ncolor, with yellowish white radial bands. The nacre has a slightly\r\nroseate tint, and the margin is greenish yellow. The pearls found herein\r\nare more yellowish in color and attain a larger size than those from the\r\nLingah oyster.\r\n\r\nThe _M. m. erythræensis_ occurs also in the Red Sea and along the shores\r\nof the Arabian Sea. Among mother-of-pearl dealers it is known as\r\n“Egyptian shell” or “Alexandria shell,” owing to the fact that prior to\r\nthe opening of the Suez Canal shipments were commonly made by way of\r\nAlexandria. The color of the nacre is darker than that of its related\r\nvariety in the Persian Gulf. In the trade, three grades of this shell\r\nare recognized, classed according to the shade of color. The lightest\r\ncomes from Massowah and near the southern end of the Red Sea, and the\r\ndarkest from farther north, in the vicinity of Jiddah and Suakim.\r\n\r\nThe islands of the southern Pacific, and of eastern Polynesia\r\nespecially, yield another variety of _M. margaritifera_, to which the\r\nname _M. m. cumingi_ has been given. The nacre is of a dark metallic\r\ngreen, and in the mother-of-pearl trade the shell is designated as\r\n“black-edged.” It attains a large size, only slightly smaller than the\r\nlarge Australian species; many individual specimens measure ten inches\r\nin diameter, and weigh six or seven pounds for the two valves. Belonging\r\nto this variety are those oysters whose shells are known in the markets\r\nof Europe and America as “Tahiti,” “Gambier,” and “Auckland” shells, the\r\nname designating the port of shipment.\r\n\r\nYet another subspecies, the _M. m. mazatlanica_, occurs on the coasts of\r\nPanama and Mexico, and especially in the Gulf of California. This is\r\nlikewise green-edged, and the exterior color is yellow or light brown.\r\nThis shell has been marketed in quantities since 1850, and is known in\r\nthe mother-of-pearl trade as “Panama shell.” It is smaller than the\r\nAustralian species, specimens rarely exceeding eight inches in diameter.\r\nIt yields a large percentage of the black pearls that have been so\r\nfashionable in the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nSince 1870, the largest pearls have been found mainly in a very large\r\nspecies of pearl-oyster, _Margaritifera maxima_, obtained off the north\r\nand west coasts of Australia, among the Sulu Islands, and elsewhere in\r\nthe Malay Archipelago. In the fisheries for this species, the\r\nmother-of-pearl is the principal object sought, and the pearls are\r\nobtained incidentally. It is the largest of all the members of this\r\nfamily, reaching in exceptional cases twelve or thirteen inches in\r\ndiameter, and weighing upward of twelve pounds; while the Ceylon oyster\r\nrarely exceeds four ounces in weight. So marked is this difference, that\r\nthe Australian species is often designated the “mother-of-pearl oyster,”\r\nand the Ceylon species the “pearl-oyster.” Jameson notes that it differs\r\nfrom the _Margaritifera margaritifera_, its nearest competitor in size,\r\nin its much longer hinge, its shape, its lesser convexity, and in its\r\ncolor and markings. As described by him, the color ranges from pale\r\nyellowish brown to deep brown, with traces of radial markings of dark\r\nbrown, green, or red in the umbonal area. In its marginal region, the\r\nshell is marked by a series of circumferential lines about one third of\r\na millimeter apart.\r\n\r\nSeveral geographical varieties of this species are recognized in the\r\nmother-of-pearl trade, differing principally in the coloring of the\r\ninterior surface. The chief commercial varieties are “Sydney” or\r\n“Queensland,” “Port Darwin,” “West Australian,” “New Guinea,” “Manila,”\r\n“Macassar,” and “Mergui.” The nacre of those from the Australian coast\r\nis almost uniformly silvery white. That of the “Manila shell” is\r\ncharacterized by a broad golden border surrounding the silvery white\r\nnacre. The “Macassar shell” lacks the golden border of the “Manila\r\nshell,” and is similar in its uniform whiteness to the “Sydney shell,”\r\nbut its iridescence is much greater.\r\n\r\nThe _Margaritifera carcharium_, from Sharks Bay, on the coast of\r\nAustralia, yields yellow pearls and small quantities of mother-of-pearl.\r\nThis species is small—three or four inches in diameter. The color is\r\ngrayish or greenish yellow, with several somewhat indistinct radial\r\nbands of brownish green. The nacre has a yellowish green tint, with a\r\nmargin of pale yellow, with brown markings.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies and on the Atlantic coast of tropical America,\r\nespecially the coast of Venezuela, occurs the _Margaritifera radiata_.\r\nThis species is quite small, and seems to be closely allied to the\r\nCeylon oyster. Like the latter, the nacreous interior is rich and\r\nbrilliant, but owing to its small size, the shell is wholly valueless as\r\nmother-of-pearl. The principal and almost the only fishery for this\r\nspecies is on the Venezuelan coast, in the vicinity of Margarita Island,\r\nthe islands of Cubagua, and Coche.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Japan yields the _Margaritifera martensi_, which occurs\r\namong the numerous islands in the southern part of the empire, but does\r\nnot extend beyond 40° north latitude. This species is likewise small,\r\nand closely resembles the pearl-oyster of Ceylon, from which it differs\r\nprincipally in coloration. As noted by Jameson, brown and white\r\npredominate in the exterior coloring, and the interior of the lip is\r\nmarbled with yellow ocher and chocolate brown, instead of pink, as in\r\nthe Ceylon shell.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other species of pearl-oysters, but they are of\r\nslight economic importance, and do not support fisheries of value.\r\n\r\nAs only a small percentage of the individual mollusks contain pearls, it\r\nfollows that vast quantities are destroyed without any return whatever,\r\nand handling them merely adds to the expense of the industry, as well as\r\nreduces the resources of the reefs. This could be obviated if it were\r\npossible, without opening them, to determine the individual mollusks\r\ncontaining pearls.\r\n\r\nAmong the several methods proposed for this purpose, especially\r\ninteresting is the use of X-rays, which was suggested by Raphael Dubois\r\nof Lyons, France, in 1901.[82] The shells of some pearl-oysters—those of\r\nCeylon and of Venezuela for instance—are relatively thin, and it was\r\nthought that by the means of the rays the presence of pearls could be\r\nascertained, and non-pearl-bearers could be saved from opening, and be\r\nreturned to the reefs without injury. Although the calcareous shell\r\npartly interrupts the radiations, it is not difficult to recognize the\r\npresence of large pearls.\r\n\r\nThe theory has never been found practical in application, owing largely\r\nto the rough and irregular exterior of the shell and the small size of\r\nthe pearls. The presence of the larger pearls may be ascertained by this\r\nmethod; but it is exceedingly probable that a very large percentage of\r\nthe small ones, and especially the seed-pearls, would be overlooked.\r\nFurthermore, if in their sixth year oysters contain no pearls, the\r\nprobability of appearance therein later is very small, and little\r\nbenefit would result from their return to the water. As to saving the\r\ntrouble of opening the non-pearl-bearing mollusks, labor in the pearling\r\nregions is usually inexpensive, and this cost is far more than offset by\r\nthe reasonable certainty of securing practically all the small as well\r\nas the large pearls by the present method of operation. Owing to the\r\ngreater thickness and the economic value of the large pearl-oysters—as\r\nthose of Australia or of Mexico, for instance—the application of X-rays\r\nto them is obviously impractical. However, when pearl-oyster culture\r\nbecomes a highly developed industry, with personal ownership in those\r\nmollusks returned to the water, some method such as this might be of\r\ngreat value.\r\n\r\nPearls are yielded by various species of _Unionidæ_ or _Naiades_\r\noccurring in the rivers of America, Scotland, Saxony, Bavaria, Norway,\r\nSweden, Russia, France, China, etc. These mollusks exist exclusively in\r\nthe fresh-water streams, lakes, and ponds, and quickly die when\r\nsubmerged in salt water. The _Unionidæ_ are of particular interest in\r\nAmerica, as it is here that this group is most abundant, and nearly\r\nevery stream east of the Rocky Mountains contains more or less of them.\r\nThe Mississippi basin abounds in Unios, or “clams,” as they are known to\r\nthe fishermen of that region, and furnishes about 400 of the 1000\r\nrecognized species of this important family.\r\n\r\nThe Unios are most abundant in clear, running water, where the bottom is\r\ngravelly or sandy. The interiors of the shells are iridescent, and vary\r\ngreatly in tint, exhibiting many delicate shades of color from silvery\r\nwhite to straw color, pink, purple, brown, etc.\r\n\r\nAbout five hundred species of American fresh-water mussels have been\r\nrecognized by conchologists. Many of these differ from one another so\r\nvery slightly that they are scarcely distinguishable from an examination\r\nof the shells themselves, or even from the descriptions, and a detailed\r\nindex to the complete list is of little economic importance. The\r\nprofessional fishermen and the shell-buyers take the trouble to name\r\nonly the species with which they deal, which includes only about\r\ntwenty-five species, all of which are margaritiferous, though some to a\r\ngreater extent than others. In the pearling regions a popular\r\nnomenclature exists, the names given by the fishermen having reference\r\nto the shape, color, etc.\r\n\r\nThe niggerhead (_Quadrula ebena_) is the most numerous in the\r\nMississippi, and it is extensively used in button manufacture. The thick\r\nshell of this species is almost round, with a black outer surface and a\r\npearly white interior. At maturity it averages about four inches in\r\ndiameter and four ounces in weight. Owing to its uniform whiteness and\r\nthe flatness of its surface, it is well adapted to button manufacture,\r\nand for this purpose more than twenty thousand tons are taken in the\r\nMississippi Valley every year. When the fishery originated, the\r\nniggerhead was very abundant in some places, and especially between La\r\nCrosse and Burlington. From a single bed near New Boston, Illinois,\r\nmeasuring about 200 acres in area, 7500 tons, or about 70,000,000\r\nindividual shells, were removed in three years. In 1897, a bed of 320\r\nacres near Muscatine furnished 500 tons, or about 4,750,000 shells. This\r\nspecies occasionally yields valuable pearls.\r\n\r\nTwo species of Unios, _Quadrula undulata_ and _Q. plicata_, are known\r\namong the fishermen as “three-ridges.” The former is also known as the\r\n“blue-point” from the fact that the sharp edge is usually tinged faint\r\nblue on the inside. Although not the best for button manufacture, the\r\nshells yield the greatest number of pearls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PINNA OR WING SHELL (_Pinna seminuda_)\r\n\r\n  One third natural size\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PEARL-OYSTER OF CEYLON (_Margaritifera vulgaris_)\r\n\r\n  Natural size\r\n]\r\n\r\nA species somewhat similar to the niggerhead is the bullhead\r\n(_Pleurobema æsopus_). This shell is thick and opaque, the nacre is not\r\nso iridescent as that of the niggerhead, nor does it yield pearls of\r\nsuch good quality. These two species are not evenly distributed over the\r\nbottom of the streams, but occur in great patches or beds, sometimes\r\nseveral feet in thickness and covering many hundreds of acres. Some of\r\nthe beds are several miles in length, and they may be separated by\r\ntwenty or thirty miles in which the mollusks are so scarce that\r\nprofitable fishing can not be made; but usually the reefs are smaller\r\nand more closely situated.\r\n\r\nThe sand shells (_Lampsilis_)—of which there are several species—do not\r\noccur in large beds, but are scattered over the sandy beaches and\r\nsloping mud-banks. In shape they are narrow and long, adults measuring\r\nfive or six inches in length. Owing to the small waste in cutting, due\r\nto uniformity in thickness, these shells are sold to button\r\nmanufacturers for more than the niggerhead, which in turn is more\r\nvaluable than the bullhead.\r\n\r\nThe buckhorn (_Tritigonia verrucosa_) is very long and narrow; on the\r\ndark brown exterior it is rough, as is the horn from which it takes its\r\nname, while the interior shows a beautiful display of colors. This is\r\nnot found in beds, but lies scattered among other species. It sells at a\r\nrelatively high price—usually in excess of $20 per ton—for button\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nAnother species is the butterfly (_Plagiola securis_), which is very\r\nprettily marked on the outside with faintly colored dotted stripes of\r\nvarying length. Over a background of dark yellow run black stripes to\r\nthe outer edge of the shell, with dark dots between the stripes. The\r\nshell is small and thick, and like the sand shell and the buckhorn, is\r\nfound in small quantities. Owing to the beauty and permanency of its\r\nluster, this shell is in demand for button manufacture, and its pearls\r\nare often very beautiful.\r\n\r\nOther well-known species are the pancake (_Lampsilis alatus_), the\r\nmaple-leaf (_Quadrula wardi_), and hackle-back (_Symphynota\r\ncomplanata_). On the Atlantic seaboard, the principal species in which\r\npearls have been found are _Unio complanata_; the _Alasmodon arcuata_,\r\nwhich has hinge teeth, and a species of Anodon. Pearls from the _Unio\r\ncomplanata_ are usually smaller but more lustrous than those from either\r\nof the other species.\r\n\r\nAmong the many fresh-water mussels are found some remarkable conditions\r\nof animal life. Probably the most curious is the parasitic stage of\r\ncertain species. When hatched from the egg, each one of these is\r\nprovided with hooks or spines, by means of which it attaches itself to\r\nthe gills or fins of a swimming fish and becomes embedded therein. After\r\nconfinement in this cyst for a period of two months or more, the small\r\nmollusk works its way out and falls to the bottom of the river or pond,\r\nwhere its development continues along lines more conventional to\r\nmolluscan life.\r\n\r\nIn most of the species of Unios the sexes are separate; but it has been\r\ndetermined that in some the individuals are provided with both sets of\r\nsexual organs. It is claimed by some naturalists that certain species\r\nmay change from one sex to another; yet this does not seem to have been\r\npositively established.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting of the habits of the Unios is the manner in\r\nwhich they “walk,” bushels of them changing their habitation in a few\r\nhours. The shell opens slightly and the muscular tongue-like “foot” is\r\nthrust out, and by pressure of this on the bottom, the mollusk is\r\npropelled in a jerky, jumpy movement with more speed than one would\r\nsuppose possible for the apparently inert creature.\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs produced by an individual in one season ranges from a\r\nfew hundred in some species to many millions in others, as in the\r\n_Quadrula heros_, for instance. Most of the fresh-water mollusks are of\r\nslow growth, reaching maturity in six or eight years, and it is believed\r\nthat if undisturbed they live to be from fifteen to fifty years old;\r\nindeed, some writers credit them with attaining an age of one hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhile outwardly there is no positive indication of the existence of\r\npearls, they are relatively scarce in young mollusks, and likewise in\r\nthose having a normal, healthy appearance, with smooth exterior free\r\nfrom blemishes, and they are found generally in the older, irregular,\r\nand deformed shells, which bear excrescences and the marks of having\r\nparasites. However, some of the choicest pearls have come from shells\r\nrelatively young and apparently in perfect condition.\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that with the fresh-water Unios there are three\r\nindications on which the fishermen to some extent rely for determining\r\nthe presence of pearls from the outward aspects of the shell. There are,\r\nfirst, the thread or elevated ridge extending from the vertex to the\r\nedge; second, the kidney-shape of the shell, and third, the contortion\r\nof both valves toward the middle plane of the mollusk.\r\n\r\nA single mollusk may contain several small pearls,—more than one hundred\r\nhave been found,—but in such cases usually none has commercial value.\r\nOrdinarily only one is found in the examination of very many shells. Of\r\nthese objects it may be truthfully said that “many are found, but few\r\nare chosen,” few that are of first quality or are worthy of a fine\r\nnecklace. In many instances, several pounds of cheap pearls would be\r\ngladly exchanged for a choice gem weighing an equal number of grains.\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic seaboard of America, the Anodontas, or “mussels,” as\r\nthey are known locally, are more numerous than the Unios. They prefer\r\nthe still waters of the ponds and lakes, rather than the swift currents\r\nof the streams. The shell is much thinner than that of the Unios, and it\r\nis usually not so brilliant in color and iridescence; consequently the\r\npearly concretions obtained from them are less lustrous.\r\n\r\nThe rivers of Europe, and of Asia also, contain numbers of pearl-bearing\r\nmussels. In many localities the yield of pearls has at times attracted\r\nattention and produced much profit, though probably never equaling the\r\npresent extent of the Mississippi River finds. The principal\r\npearl-bearer of Europe is the _Unio margaritifera_, the shell of which\r\nhas been of some local importance in the manufacture of pearl buttons.\r\nIn Great Britain it is known as the pearl-mussel; in France as the\r\n_moule_ or _huître perlière_; in Germany as _perlenmuschel_; in Belgium\r\nas _paarl mossel de rivieren_; in Denmark as _perle-skiael_; in Sweden\r\nas _perlmussla_; in Russia as _schemtschuschuaja rakavina_, and in\r\nFinland as _simpsuckan cuosi_. The _Unio margaritifera_ likewise exists\r\nin Siberia, and possibly elsewhere in Asia. Other species of Unio exist\r\nthere and in Mongolia, Manchuria, etc., as, for instance, _U.\r\nmongolicus_, _U. dahuricus_, etc. A leading species in eastern China,\r\nthe _Dipsas plicatus_, has long been extensively employed in the\r\nartificial production of pearly objects or culture pearls.[83] Unio\r\npearls show less uniformity of tints than those derived from the\r\npearl-oysters. They present an extended series of shades, corresponding\r\nto those on the interior of the shells, from almost perfect white\r\nthrough various tints of cream, pink, yellow, bright red, blue, green,\r\nrusset, and brown. The metallic shades are numerous, especially the\r\nsteels and the coppers.\r\n\r\nMost of the members of the _Mytilidæ_ family, which includes the marine\r\nmussels, are of slight luster; and the pearly concretions found in them\r\nare of the grade known as “druggists’ pearls,” so-called because,\r\nformerly, they were used in a powdered form in astringent and other\r\nmedicines. However, some of these mussels on the European coast yield\r\npearls that are fairly lustrous. The white and the pink are most\r\nnumerous, but purple, red, bronze, and yellow are by no means uncommon.\r\n\r\nA few pearls are also obtained from the sea-wings or wing-shells\r\n(_Pinna_), the silkworms of the sea, found in the Red Sea, the\r\nMediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean, the southern coast of America, and\r\nelsewhere. These shells are narrow at the umbo, or hinge, long, and\r\nfan-shaped; they are generally brittle, and present a horn-like\r\nappearance. The interior is commonly of a silvery reddish or\r\norange-colored hue, and this tint is imparted to the pearls. The most\r\ncharacteristic feature of the _Pinna_ is the thick rope of silky fibers,\r\nfrom four to ten, and sometimes twenty or more inches in length,\r\nconstituting the byssus, a remarkable provision by means of which it\r\nanchors itself to the bottom and thus outrides the storm. Formerly the\r\nbyssus was gathered in Sicily, washed in soap and water, dried, corded,\r\nand fabricated into gloves and similar articles of a fine texture. The\r\nfinished garments were of a beautiful golden brown color, resembling the\r\nburnished gold on the backs of some splendid flies or beetles.\r\n\r\nThe yield of _Pinna_ pearls is very small. A few are obtained from the\r\nMediterranean, especially on the Adriatic coast. These are usually\r\nrose-tinted or reddish in color, but of diminished orient, and inferior\r\nin size. _Pinna_ pearls are also reported from the Isle of Pines and\r\nfrom New Caledonia, where they are commonly very dark, almost black in\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThe window-glass shell (_Placuna placenta_), the _vitre chinoise_ of\r\nsome writers, yields a few small, irregularly shaped pearls of a dull\r\nleaden color. It occurs in the inshore waters of the Indian and the\r\nsouthwestern Pacific oceans; fisheries are prosecuted in Tablegram Lake,\r\nnear Trincomali, on the northeast coast of Ceylon; on the coast of\r\nBorneo, especially at Pados Bay, and to a less extent in some other\r\nlocalities. This mollusk is quite distinct from the true pearl-oyster,\r\nand in adult life is devoid of the byssus, living on the muddy bottom of\r\nthe shallow waters. The shell is almost circular, the right valve is\r\nquite flat, and the left only slightly convex. It is remarkable for its\r\ntransparency, especially in the first year of growth, when the beating\r\nof the heart of the mollusk is visible through it. Reaching maturity in\r\nabout two years, the shell becomes white and translucent, resembling\r\npressed isinglass somewhat in its texture. It then measures about six or\r\nseven inches in length, and nearly the same in width. The outside is\r\nrough; the interior is glazed over and has a subdued pearly luster. It\r\nis so thin and transparent that with a strong light very coarse print\r\ncan be read through it. It is commonly used in the East Indies as a\r\nsubstitute for glass in windows, admitting a soft mellow light into the\r\nroom. For this purpose it is usually cut into small rectangular or\r\ndiamond-shaped pieces, about five or six square inches in area, and\r\nthese are inserted into sash frames. It forms a good economical\r\nsubstitute for glass, not only in windows of native residences, but also\r\nin lanterns and the like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SHELL AND PEARLS OF THE COMMON CONCH\r\n\r\n  (_Strombus gigas_)\r\n\r\n  Of Florida and the West Indies\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe giant clam (_Tridacna gigas_) of tropical waters yields a few large\r\nopal-white symmetrical pearls, with faint luster and of little value.\r\nThe transversely oval shell of the _Tridacna_, with its great squamous\r\nribs, is probably the largest and heaviest in existence, single pairs\r\nweighing upward of 500 pounds. It is found in tropical seas, and\r\nespecially in the Indian Ocean. It is much used for ornament,\r\nparticularly for fountain-basins, and for _bénitiers_, or holy-water\r\nfonts. A beautiful pair used as _bénitiers_ in the Church of St. Sulpice\r\nin Paris is said to have been a gift of the Republic of Venice to\r\nFrancis I. There seems to be no established fishery for this mollusk,\r\nand the pearls very rarely come on the market. About four years ago in\r\nNew York City an effort was made to market one weighing about 200\r\ngrains. The owner represented that it was a “cocoanut pearl,” and\r\noffered to sell it for $2000; whereas its actual value was probably not\r\nover $10 or $20, and that only for a museum collection.\r\n\r\nPearls of slight luster also occur in the quahog, or hard clam (_Venus\r\nmercenaria_), of the Atlantic coast of the United States. Although these\r\nare rare, they are generally of good form, and some weigh upward of\r\neighty grains each. They are commonly of dark color, purplish,\r\nordinarily, but they may be white, pale lilac, brown, and even purplish\r\nblack, or black. The white ones—which so nearly resemble ivory buttons\r\nas readily to pass for them at a casual glance—are of little value; but\r\nfine dark ones have retailed at from $10 to $100 each. There is little\r\ndemand for them, for unless the color is very good, they possess slight\r\nbeauty, lacking the orient peculiar to choice pearls. Pearls have also\r\nbeen reported from the edible clam of the Pacific coast of America.\r\n\r\nShelly concretions are found in the edible oyster of America (_Ostrea\r\nvirginica_), as well as in that of Europe (_O. edulis_); but these are\r\ncommonly objects of personal interest or of local curiosity, rather than\r\nof artistic or commercial value, as they are lacking in luster and\r\niridescence. Most of them are dull or opal-white, some are purple, and a\r\nfew are white on one side and purple on the other. As many as fifty of\r\nthese formations have been found in a single oyster. Sometimes they are\r\nof odd appearance, suggesting the human eye or face, and recently one\r\nwas found which bore a striking resemblance to a human skull.\r\nNotwithstanding many news items to the contrary, it is doubtful whether\r\nthe choicest pearl from an edible oyster would sell for as high as $20\r\non its own merits; professional shuckers have opened thousands of\r\nbushels of oysters without finding one which would sell for ten cents.\r\n\r\nAmong univalves, the most prominent pearl-producer is probably the\r\ncommon conch or great conch (_Strombus gigas_) of the West Indies and\r\nthe Florida coast, which secretes beautiful pink pearls of considerable\r\nvalue. This is one of the largest of the univalve shells, some\r\nindividuals measuring twelve inches in length, and weighing five or six\r\npounds. The graceful curves and the delicate tints of lovely pink color\r\nmake it exceedingly attractive. The conch abounds in the waters of the\r\nWest Indies, especially in the Bahamas, where many thousands are\r\nannually taken for the shell, which forms quite an article of commerce.\r\nThe flesh is esteemed as food and is also used for bait; and it is\r\nparticularly in preparing for these purposes that the pearls are found,\r\nas no established fisheries exist for the pearls alone.\r\n\r\nThe ear-shells or abalones (Haliotidæ) found on the coasts of\r\nCalifornia, Japan, New Zealand, and other localities in the Pacific,\r\nsecrete pearly concretions, sometimes with fine luster, but usually of\r\nsmall value. These shells resemble in general outline the form of the\r\nhuman ear. Distinguishing characteristics are the flatly-spiral\r\nbowl-like shape, and the regular series of holes in the back near the\r\ndistal margin, for the admission of water to the respiratory organs. The\r\nholes are on the left side and parallel with the columellar lip, and\r\nthose nearest the apex close up as the shell increases in size. The\r\nshells are rough externally, but beautifully nacreous within. In variety\r\nand intensity of coloring, the nacre is superior to that of the\r\npearl-oysters, but it is not so harmonious, and it does not form so\r\nthick and flat a layer.\r\n\r\nAbalone pearls are especially interesting on account of their brilliant\r\nand unusual colors. Green predominates, but blue and yellow also occur.\r\nAlthough commonly very small, some of the well formed ones exceed\r\nseventy-five grains in weight, and those of irregular shape may be very\r\nmuch larger. The ear-shells also produce many irregular pearly masses.\r\nAlthough these are without an established commercial value, their\r\nbeautiful greenish or bluish tints adapt them for artistic jeweled\r\nobjects, such as the body of a fly or of a beetle.\r\n\r\nSimilar concretions are found in species of turbos and turbinella,\r\nespecially the Indian chank (_Turbinella rapa_), which yields pink and\r\npale red pearls. The pearly nautilus (_Nautilus pompilius_) yields a few\r\nyellowish pearls, especially those taken in Australian waters; but from\r\nthe paper nautilus—“the sea-born sailor of his shell canoe”—no pearls\r\nare obtained, owing to the non-lustrous nature of the shell.\r\n\r\nIn bygone days, especially in Asia, and also to some extent in Europe,\r\npearls were credited as coming from many non-molluscan sources. The\r\nRabbis had the idea that they came also from fish, as noted in the story\r\nof a tailor who was rewarded by finding a pearl in one which he bought\r\n(Gen. R. xi. 5). The Raganighantu of Narahari, a Kashmir physician of\r\nabout 1240 _A.D._, reported them as coming from bamboos, cocoanuts,\r\nheads of elephants, bears, serpents, whales, fish, etc.;[84] although it\r\nconceded that these were deficient in luster, which is recognized as the\r\ncharacteristic feature of pearls. We understand, therefore, that this\r\nuse of the word signifies only hard concretions of a spherical form. In\r\nthe apology for his book, prison-bound Bunyan wrote:\r\n\r\n                  A pearl may in a toad’s head dwell,\r\n                  And may be found in an oyster shell.\r\n\r\nThe crystal gems—the diamonds, rubies, etc.—are practically unlimited in\r\ntheir longevity, existing thousands of years unchanged in condition.\r\nExcept those which have been discovered by man, the earth contains about\r\nas many as it ever did, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that in\r\ncourse of time a considerable percentage of the total will be\r\ndiscovered. But in the seas as well as in the rivers, the longevity of\r\npearls is greatly restricted, and\r\n\r\n              Full many a gem of purest ray serene\r\n              The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear[85]\r\n\r\nto run their course of existence and decay unseen and unknown.\r\nPerishable while in the seas, almost as cereals and fruits on land, the\r\nharvest must be gathered with promptness or it is wasted. And it seems\r\nprobable that only a small percentage of the beautiful gems produced in\r\nthe waters have gladdened the sight of man.\r\n\r\nWith considerable hesitancy we have attempted to estimate the number of\r\npersons employed in the pearl fisheries of the world, and the aggregate\r\nlocal value of their catch. For two or three regions, this is not a\r\nmatter of great difficulty. For instance, the divers employed in the\r\nCeylon fishery are numbered each season, and the auction sales of their\r\ncatch furnish a reasonably satisfactory basis for determining the value\r\nof the output. Likewise in Australia, Venezuela, and some minor\r\nlocalities, the fishermen are numbered; but the reports are less\r\nsatisfactory as to the value of the pearls. In the Persian Gulf, the Red\r\nSea, the Gulf of California, and the islands of the Pacific, where\r\npearl-diving is a profession and a regular source of livelihood, the\r\nnumber of employees is fairly constant. But in the rivers and ponds of\r\nAmerica, as well as of Europe and of Asia, where neither experience nor\r\ncostly equipment is required for the industry, and pearls to the value\r\nof very many thousands of dollars are obtained by men, women, and even\r\nchildren, on pleasure bent, as well as in the widely fluctuating\r\nprofessional fisheries, the problem is far more difficult.\r\n\r\nContending with these many difficulties, we venture to present the\r\nfollowing estimate of the number of persons employed in the pearl\r\nfisheries of the world, and the value of the output in 1906.\r\n\r\n               Localities.

The difference in price between pearls in the\r\nfisherman’s hands in the Persian Gulf or at the Pacific islands, and\r\nthat for which they are exchanged over the counters in New York or\r\nParis, is nearly as great as the difference in value of wool on the\r\nsheep’s back and of the same material woven into fashionable fabrics.\r\nFor each dollar received by the fisherman, the retail buyer probably\r\npays three; and it is not unreasonable to suppose that the pearls herein\r\nrepresented probably sold ultimately for an aggregate of $24,420,000.\r\n\r\nThis summary falls far short in giving a correct idea of the importance\r\nof the pearl fisheries in furnishing a livelihood to humanity; for it\r\ntakes no consideration of that great body of men who contribute\r\nincidentally to the prosecution of the fisheries, such as shell-openers,\r\npearl-washers, watchmen, cooks, laborers, etc. In the Ceylon pearl\r\nfishery of 1906, for instance, our estimate shows 18,500 fishermen; but\r\nthere were 40,000 persons engaged at the pearl camp alone, and many\r\nothers were given employment in boat-building, supplying provisions,\r\nselling the pearls, etc., and this does not include the wives and\r\nchildren depending on the industry for sustenance. Indeed, it seems not\r\nunreasonable to estimate that instead of only the 18,500 fishermen,\r\n85,000 persons were in a large measure dependent for their livelihood on\r\nthe Ceylon fishery in 1906.\r\n\r\nEstimated on the same basis, we have a total of 500,000 persons\r\ndepending largely on the pearl fisheries of the world for their support.\r\nThus we see that pearl buyers and pearl wearers not only gratify a\r\ncommendable admiration for the beautiful, but contribute largely to the\r\neconomic balance whereby one class of humanity either sustains or is\r\ndependent upon another, even though these classes be so widely separated\r\nas the crown of Russia from the half-starved diver of the tropical seas.\r\nHow strange is the providence of God, who, by granting the pearl to the\r\npoor Arab, the Tamil of India, the South Sea Islander, and the forgotten\r\nSelang of Mergui, makes the greatest and wealthiest in the world\r\ncontribute to their support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\n                            PEARLS FROM ASIA\r\n\r\n THE PERSIAN GULF, FISHERIES OF INDIA, CEYLON PEARL FISHERIES, RED SEA\r\n              AND ARABIAN SEA, CHINA, JAPAN, SIBERIA, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n                THE PEARL FISHERIES OF THE PERSIAN GULF\r\n\r\n\r\n            Dear as the wet diver to the eyes\r\n            Of his pale wife, who waits and weeps on shore,\r\n            By sands of Bahrein in the Persian Gulf;\r\n            Plunging all day in the blue waves; at night,\r\n            Having made up his toll of precious pearls,\r\n            Rejoins her in their hut upon the shore.\r\n\r\n                                      SIR EDWIN ARNOLD.\r\n\r\nThe pearl fisheries of the Persian Gulf are the most famous and valuable\r\nin the world, and have been prosecuted for more than two thousand years.\r\nA translation by that eminent Assyriologist, Jules Oppert, of a\r\ncuneiform inscription on a broken obelisk, erected presumably by a king\r\nof Nineveh, seems to indicate a very early origin for these\r\nfisheries.[89] Professor Oppert’s translation is:\r\n\r\n     In the sea of the changeable winds (_i.e._, the Persian Gulf),\r\n     his merchants fished for pearls;\r\n     In the sea where the North Star culminates,\r\n     they fished for yellow amber.\r\n\r\nThe earliest writing of Europeans on the East refer to these fisheries.\r\nAn account of them was given by the Greek writer Megasthenes, who\r\naccompanied Seleucus Nicator, the Macedonian general, in his Asiatic\r\nconquests, about 307 B.C. Shortly afterward they were noted by the Greek\r\nhistorian, Isidorus of Charace, in his account of the Parthian Empire.\r\nExtracts from Nearchus preserved by Arrian also mention them. Ptolemy\r\nspeaks of the pearl fisheries which existed from time immemorial at\r\nTylos, the Roman name for the present Island of Bahrein. These resources\r\nwere well known in the days of Pliny. In his “Historia Naturalis,” Book\r\nIX, ch. 35, he says: “But the most perfect and exquisite [pearls] of all\r\nothers be they that are gotten about Arabia, within the Persian\r\nGulf.”[90] Pliny states also (Book VI, ch. 25) that Catifa (El Katiff),\r\non the Arabian coast opposite Bahrein, was the center of an important\r\nfishery.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century these fisheries were noted by Massoudi, one of the\r\nearliest Arabian geographers.[91] In the latter part of the twelfth\r\ncentury they were visited and described by the Spanish-Hebrew traveler,\r\nRabbi Benjamin of Tudela.[92] The Arabian traveler, Ibn Batuta, wrote of\r\nthem about 1336.[93] In 1508 they were noted in the account of Lodovico\r\nBarthema’s expedition to the Island of Ormus. According to him:\r\n\r\n  At three days’ journey from this island they fished the largest\r\n  pearls which are found in the world; and whoever wishes to know\r\n  about it, behold! There are certain fishermen who go there in small\r\n  boats and cast into the water two large stones attached to ropes,\r\n  one at the bow, the other at the stern of each boat to stay it in\r\n  place. Then one of the fishermen hangs a sack from his neck,\r\n  attaches a large stone to his feet, and descends to the bottom—about\r\n  fifteen paces under water, where he remains as long as he can,\r\n  searching for oysters which bear pearls, and puts as many as he\r\n  finds into his sack. When he can remain no longer, he casts off the\r\n  stone attached to his feet, and ascends by one of the ropes fastened\r\n  to the boat. There are so many connected with the business that you\r\n  will often see 300 of these little boats which come from many\r\n  countries.[94]\r\n\r\nShortly following the visit of Barthema, the Portuguese under\r\nAlbuquerque took possession of the principal ports of the Persian Gulf,\r\nand they imposed heavy taxes on the pearl fishery throughout the century\r\nof their retention. While under their jurisdiction, the fisheries were\r\nvisited and described by J. H. van Linschoten in 1596, who wrote:\r\n\r\n  The principall and the best that are found in all the Orientall\r\n  Countries, and the right Orientall pearles, are between Ormus and\r\n  Bassora in the straights, or Sinus Persicus, in the places called\r\n  Bareyn, Catiffa, Julfar, Camaron, and other places in the said Sinus\r\n  Persicus, from whence they are brought into Ormus. The king of\r\n  Portingale hath also his factor in Bareyn, that stayeth there onlie\r\n  for the fishing of pearles. There is great trafficke used with them,\r\n  as well in Ormus as in Goa.[95]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Cargo boat in pearl fishery of the Persian Gulf\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Huts of mats and palm leaves, the homes of the pearl fishermen at\r\n    Menamah, Bahrein Islands, Persian Gulf\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis was the Ormus where the treasures of the Orient were gathered in\r\nabundance, the half-way house between the East and the West, making it\r\none of the greatest emporia of the world. So renowned was its wealth and\r\ncommerce that it was a saying among the Portuguese, were the whole world\r\na golden ring, Ormus would be the jeweled signet. It was built on an\r\nisland, supported a population of 40,000 persons, and was particularly\r\nwell situated as a distributing point for the pearls, which enriched the\r\nargosies of Portugal, and contributed so largely to\r\n\r\n                            the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,\r\n            Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand\r\n            Show’rs on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,\r\n\r\nwhich Milton celebrates in “Paradise Lost.” This wonderful Ormus, in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries one of the wealthiest places in the\r\nworld, is now only a fishing village of less than a hundred huts.\r\n\r\nIt was at Ormus, nearly a century later, in 1670, that the shrewd old\r\njewel merchant, Tavernier, whose acquaintance with gems doubtless\r\nequaled that of any man of his time, saw what he called “the most\r\nbeautiful pearl in the world”; not so much for its size, for it weighed\r\nonly 48¼ grains, nor for its regularity in form, but because of its most\r\nwonderful luster.[96]\r\n\r\nIn describing the fisheries, which had been retaken by the Persians in\r\n1622, Tavernier wrote in 1670, according to Ball’s translation:\r\n\r\n  There is a pearl fishery round the island of Bahren, in the Persian\r\n  Gulf. It belongs to the King of Persia, and there is a good fortress\r\n  there, where a garrison of 300 men is kept.... When the Portuguese\r\n  held Hormuz [Ormus] and Muscat, each boat which went to fish was\r\n  obliged to take out a license from them, which cost fifteen\r\n  _abassis_ [$5.45], and many brigantines were maintained there, to\r\n  sink those who were unwilling to take out licenses. But since the\r\n  Arabs have retaken Muscat, and the Portuguese are no longer supreme\r\n  in the Gulf, every man who fishes pays to the King of Persia only\r\n  five _abassis_, whether his fishing is successful or not. The\r\n  merchant also pays the king something small for every 1,000 oysters.\r\n  The second pearl fishery is opposite Bahren, on the coast of Arabia\r\n  Felix, close to the town of El Katif, which, with all the\r\n  neighboring country, belongs to an Arab prince.[97]\r\n\r\nDuring the century following Tavernier’s time, the fisheries were\r\nvigorously prosecuted, owing to the impoverished condition of the reefs\r\nin India and America, and to the large demand for pearls, not only by\r\nthe Oriental courts, but by the wealth and fashion of Europe. Except for\r\nthe last four years, when the Ceylon fishery was very productive,\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century the Persian Gulf was almost the only\r\nimportant source of supply for pearls. For several years following the\r\nreopening of the Ceylon fishery in 1796, that region diverted some of\r\nthe attention which the Persian waters had been receiving, but it was\r\nnot long before these regained their ascendancy.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, Lieutenant J. R. Wellsted, an officer in the British India\r\nservice, reported that the fisheries of the gulf employed 4300 boats,\r\nmanned by somewhat more than 30,000 men.[98] Of these boats, 3500 were\r\nfrom the Island of Bahrein, 100 from the Persian coast, and the\r\nremaining 700 from the Pirate Coast situated between Bahrein and the\r\nentrance to the Gulf of Oman. Lieutenant Wellsted estimated the value of\r\nthe pearls secured annually as approximately £400,000, which is somewhat\r\nless than the average value of the output in recent years.\r\n\r\nTwenty-seven years later, according to Sir Lewis Pelly,[99] who was in\r\nthe Indian service from 1851 to 1877, there were 1500 boats at Bahrein,\r\nand the annual return from the whole fishery was £400,000, the same as\r\npreviously reported by Wellsted. In 1879, the value of the output was\r\nestimated at £600,000 by the British Resident, Colonel Ross, and at\r\n£800,000 by Captain L. E. Durand, of the British Protectorate of the\r\nPersian Gulf. Owing to the increased market value, the average output in\r\nthe last five years has amounted to approximately four million dollars\r\nannually. This refers to the local value only, which is greatly\r\nincreased by the time the pearls leave the markets in Bombay and Bagdad.\r\n\r\nThe Persian Gulf is nearly 600 miles long, with an average width of\r\nsomewhat more than 100 miles. The Strait of Ormus—thirty to sixty miles\r\nwide—connects it with the Gulf of Oman, which opens directly into the\r\nArabian Sea. The depth of water rarely exceeds thirty fathoms. Oyster\r\nreefs are well distributed throughout the gulf, and are in greatest\r\nabundance on the Arab side between the 24th and 27th degrees of north\r\nlatitude and the 50th and 54th degrees of east longitude, at a distance\r\nof from a few hundred yards to sixty miles from the shore, and\r\nespecially in the vicinity of the Bahrein Islands. The oysters are\r\nscattered over level areas of coral rock and sand, with depths ranging\r\nfrom two to eighteen fathoms.[100] The divers rarely descend in deeper\r\nwater than twelve fathoms, notwithstanding that valuable pearls are\r\napparently obtainable at greater depths.\r\n\r\nAlthough the British Protectorate extends over the Persian Gulf,\r\ninsuring the peaceful prosecution of the fisheries and the settlement of\r\nintertribal contentions by the government resident, the fisheries are\r\nunder the regulations of the maritime Arab sheiks. The restrictions\r\nimposed by these, however, are principally with a view to collecting a\r\nrevenue from each boat employed. The total amount realized thereby is\r\nunknown, but there is good reason for supposing that it is considerable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AGHA MOHAMMED (1666–1725)\r\n\r\n  Founder of the present Persian dynasty\r\n\r\n  From a Persian manuscript in the library of Robert Hoe, Esq.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SHAH SULAIMAN (1647–1694)\r\n\r\n  From a Persian manuscript in the library of Robert Hoe, Esq.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fisheries are carried on during the greater part of every year,\r\npresenting a strong contrast to the Ceylon fishery, which is prosecuted\r\nusually less than forty days, and in only about one year in three on an\r\naverage. This is especially remarkable when it is considered that no\r\nparticular care is taken of the Persian reefs and, except for certain\r\ntribal restrictions, the fishermen may work whenever and wherever they\r\nchoose. Owing to the extended area over which the fishing is prosecuted\r\nand the existence of undisturbed breeding-oysters in the deeper waters,\r\nthe reefs are not readily exhausted, notwithstanding the tens of\r\nmillions of mollusks annually removed therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries are at their height from June to September, when nearly\r\nevery person on the coast is interested in some capacity, if not in\r\nfishing, at least in furnishing supplies, cleaning shells, buying\r\npearls, etc. In April and May the water on the deep banks is so cold\r\nthat the fishermen confine their efforts to the more shallow areas.\r\nDuring the winter months, the cold weather and the northwesterly gales\r\ninterfere with the work, except such as is prosecuted in the smaller\r\nbays and inlets.\r\n\r\nThe pearling operations are financed mostly by Indian _bunnias_, or\r\ntraders, principally from Bombay, who furnish capital for equipment,\r\nsupplies of food, etc., and who purchase the pearls in gross lots. These\r\nmen bear very hard on the fishermen, furnishing the supplies and buying\r\nthe pearls almost at their own prices; and the poor divers who explore\r\nthe depths and secure the pearls derive from their exertions little more\r\nthan the crudest necessaries of life, and are usually in debt to the\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\nThe actual fishing operations are carried on mainly by the maritime\r\ntribes of Hasa and Oman, including those on the Pirate Coast. The\r\ninhabitants of the Bahrein Islands and the adjacent shores have been\r\ndevoted to pearling from time immemorial; but the Wahabis of the Pirate\r\nCoast—the _Ichthyophagi_ of Ptolemy’s time—have more recently, under the\r\npersuasive influence of British gunboats and magazine-rifles,\r\nsubstituted pearling for their two-century inherited life of fanatical\r\npiracy. Referring to these people in his quaint sketches of Persia\r\neighty years ago, Sir John Malcolm wrote: “Their occupation is piracy,\r\nand their delight murder, and to make it worse they give you the most\r\npious reasons for every villainy they commit. They abide by the letter\r\nof the sacred volume, rejecting all commentaries and traditions. If you\r\nare their captive and offer all to save your life, they say, “No! It is\r\nwritten in the Koran that it is not lawful to plunder the living; but we\r\nare not prohibited from stripping the dead. So saying they knock you on\r\nthe head.”[101] Most of the Wahabi pearlers congregate in the mat-hut\r\nsettlements of Dobai, Abu Thubi, and Ras-el-Kheima, located at the\r\nmouths of creeks which form fairly good harbors for the small boats. The\r\nBatina coast also furnishes some pearl fishermen, these coming\r\nprincipally from Fujaira, Shenas, Sohar, Suaik, and Sib.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters for the pearling fleet are at Bahrein Island, the\r\nlargest of the insular group bearing the same name, the islets of\r\nMoharrek, Sitrah, and Nissan completing the group. This is the early\r\nhome of Chaldean civilization, and one of the traditional sources of the\r\nPhenicians, and whence came that fish-god who—according to the\r\nBabylonian myth—bore the ark over the deluge. This island, the center of\r\nthe greatest pearl fishery in the world, is half way down on the\r\nsouthern side of the Persian Gulf, and twenty miles from the mainland of\r\n“Araby the blest.” It is about twenty-eight miles in length, and ten in\r\nwidth at the widest part. The population approximates 60,000, all\r\nMoslems, except about 100 Banyan traders from Sindh, India. The northern\r\nhalf of the island is described as of great beauty, being a garden of\r\npomegranate, lemon, citron, and quince-trees, and especially the\r\nmagnificent date-palms, with numerous springs furnishing an abundance of\r\nexcellent fresh water. The principal settlement, Manama, with about\r\n10,000 inhabitants, is poorly built, the houses consisting mostly of\r\nhuts of mats and palm leaves; yet it presents a better appearance than\r\nany other settlement along this coast.\r\n\r\nThe one great industry, and the center of all interest throughout this\r\nregion, is the pearl fishery. The present conditions are precisely as\r\nPalgrave wrote in 1863: “It is from the sea, not from the land, that the\r\nnatives subsist; and it is also mainly on the sea that they dwell,\r\npassing amid its waters the one half of the year in search of pearls,\r\nthe other half in fishery or trade. Hence their real homes are the\r\ncountless boats which stud the placid pool, or stand drawn up in long\r\nblack lines on the shore, while little care is taken to ornament their\r\nland houses, the abodes of their wives and children at most, and the\r\nunsightly strong boxes of their treasures. ‘We are all, from the highest\r\nto the lowest, slaves of one master—Pearl,’ said Mohammed bin Thanee to\r\nme one evening; nor was the expression out of place. All thought, all\r\nconversation, all employment, turns on that one subject; everything else\r\nis merely by-game, and below even secondary consideration.”[102]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ARAB PEARL-DIVERS AT WORK IN THE PERSIAN GULF\r\n]\r\n\r\nAccording to recent returns, the Persian Gulf fisheries employ about\r\n3500 boats,[103] large and small, of which 1200 of the best are owned at\r\nBahrein, 700 on the coast of El Hassa from El Katar to Kuweit, and the\r\nremaining 1600 are from various parts of the gulf, and especially from\r\nthe Pirate Coast east of El Katar. They measure from one to fifty tons.\r\nThe smaller ones, with three to fifteen men each, work near the shores;\r\nthe larger, carrying fifteen to thirty men, fish over the whole gulf,\r\nremaining out for weeks at a time. These craft are very picturesque with\r\ntheir artistic rigs and spoon-shaped sails, and when the fishery is at\r\nits height the scene is one of rare interest. The boats from Bahrein are\r\nof excellent construction made by native workmen using local materials,\r\nwith home-woven sailcloth and rigging of twisted date-fiber. Each of the\r\nlarger ones usually evidences a lingering trace of Semitic influence in\r\nits _kubait_, or figurehead, covered with skin of the sheep or goat\r\nsacrificed in the launching ceremonies.[104] The boats from El Hassa and\r\nthe Pirate Coast are usually smaller and less substantial than those\r\nfrom Bahrein, the fishermen from the latter place far surpassing those\r\nof the mainland in civilization and industrial wealth.\r\n\r\nThe fleet is manned by approximately 35,000 fishermen. In addition to\r\nthe _nakhoda_, or captain, who is often the owner of the boat, the crew\r\nconsists of _ghoas_ or divers, who are mainly Arabs and Sedees, and\r\n_sebs_, or rope-tenders, who are usually Bedouins or Persians and attend\r\nthe divers and perform other duties. Many Hindus from India, and\r\nflat-nosed, sable-hued Negroes from the east coast of Africa find\r\nemployment here. On each of the larger boats is a general utility man,\r\nknown as _el musully_, literally the “prayer-man,” who, in addition to\r\nvarious other duties, relieves those _sebs_ who stop to pray.\r\n\r\nAmong the fishermen are all types and classes to be met with in this\r\npart of the world, with the usual contingent of the lame, the halt, and\r\nthe blind. There are a number of fishermen who have been maimed and\r\nmutilated by shark bites. A surprisingly large number of men who have\r\nbecome totally blind engage in diving, and they usually do fairly well\r\nwhere the oysters are abundant on the reefs. And one or two unfortunate\r\ndivers are reported who continue the work even though handicapped by the\r\nloss both of a leg and of eyesight, this interfering less with their\r\ndiving than with their movements on land.\r\n\r\nThe fishery in this region owes absolutely nothing to modern\r\ncivilization in the method of securing the pearls from the depth of the\r\nsea; it is carried on to-day practically as it was six hundred years\r\nago, and probably has been without important variation for two thousand\r\nyears. Aside from a loin-cloth, the diver is devoid of clothing except\r\nthat rarely, early in the season when _polypi_ abound, he is enveloped\r\nin a cotton overall as a protection. Over each finger and thumb he wears\r\na shield or stall (_khubaat_, or finger-hat), about two inches long,\r\nmade of flexible leather, to protect the fingers from the sharp shells\r\nand coral-growths. As each fisherman usually wears out at least two sets\r\nof these shields each season, it will be seen that a very large quantity\r\nof them is required to supply the entire fleet.\r\n\r\nThe divers use stones on which they descend feet foremost. Although this\r\nis less spectacular than the method of diving practised by the natives\r\nof the South Sea islands, it enables the fisherman to reach the bottom\r\nmore speedily and with far less effort. The diving-stones range in\r\nweight from thirty to fifty pounds each, depending largely on the depth\r\nof water and the weight of the fisherman. They are somewhat oval in\r\nshape, and have one end perforated to admit a rope. Immediately above\r\nthe attachment is formed a loop, resembling a stirrup, to receive the\r\ndiver’s foot. When prepared for the day’s work, each stone is suspended\r\nby a stout rope over outriggers projecting from the side of the boat,\r\nand by a slip-knot is temporarily held four and a half or five feet\r\nbelow the surface of the water. A very stout diver may have a stone\r\naffixed to his waist to overcome his greater buoyancy. Usually two\r\ndivers use one stone together and descend alternately. Each one has an\r\nattendant in the boat who assists him in ascending, and looks after the\r\nropes, baskets of shells, etc.\r\n\r\nIn preparing for descent, the fisherman takes hold of the rope from\r\nwhich the diving stone is suspended, puts one foot in the loop just\r\nabove the stone and places the other foot in the rim of a net basket,\r\neighteen inches wide, made of coir rope. When ready, he signals his\r\nattendant, inhales several good breaths, closes his nostrils with a\r\n_fitaam_ or nostril-clasp of flexible horn attached to a cord around his\r\nneck, raises his body somewhat above the surface to give force to the\r\ndescent, releases the slip-knot retaining the stone, and sinks rapidly\r\nto the bottom. Immediately disengaging his foot from the stone, he\r\nthrows himself in a stooping position on the ground and collects as many\r\noysters as possible during the fifty seconds or more in which he is able\r\nto remain under water. When near his limit of endurance, he hastily\r\ngives a signal jerk to the rope attached to the basket, and the watchful\r\nattendant hauls him up as speedily as possible, the diver frequently\r\nquickening the ascent by hand over hand movement up the rope. When near\r\nthe surface, he lets go of the rope and with his arms close to his body\r\npops above the surface puffing and blowing. The contents of the net bag\r\nare emptied into a large basket by the attendant, and the dead shells\r\nand other refuse are separated from the live oysters and thrown back\r\ninto the sea, the diver having worked too rapidly at the bottom to\r\ndiscriminate closely as to what he gathered.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the stone has been drawn up and suspended by the\r\nslip-knot in its customary position and the diving partner is resting at\r\nthe surface preparatory to descending. Thus, diving alternately at\r\nintervals of five or six minutes, each fisherman descends thirty or\r\nforty times in an ordinary day’s work. The number of oysters gathered at\r\neach descent depends on such conditions as their abundance, the depth\r\nand clearness of the water, etc. It ranges from none to fifty or more,\r\nbut ordinarily ten or twelve is a good average. As the men commonly work\r\non shares, the shells brought up by each diver or by each pair of divers\r\nare kept separate.\r\n\r\nThe best type of Arab divers are very careful of themselves, drying the\r\nbody thoroughly with towels on coming out of the water, taking intervals\r\nof rest during the day’s work; and even while in the water between dives\r\nthey may enjoy the luxury of a cheroot or pipe, or possibly a cigarette\r\nmay pass from mouth to mouth of several men.\r\n\r\nWhen pursuing their work, the divers are abstemious. After devotions at\r\nsunrise and a light breakfast of perhaps dates or rice and coffee, they\r\nbegin fishing. About noon they knock off for coffee, prayers, and an\r\nhour’s siesta, and then resume work for several hours. When the day’s\r\nwork is over and they have faced Meccaward with the customary prayers,\r\nthey rest and eat a substantial meal, commonly of dates and fish roasted\r\nover a charcoal fire.\r\n\r\nIn equal depths the Arab fishermen remain under water longer than those\r\nof India who resort to the Ceylon fishery, but this is partly\r\ncounterbalanced by the latter descending somewhat more frequently. When\r\npreparing for a lengthy dive, the fisherman imbibes large quantities of\r\nair, opening his mouth and inhaling large volumes.\r\n\r\nThe length of time a diver remains submerged in the average depth of\r\nseven or eight fathoms rarely exceeds sixty seconds, although some may\r\nremain seventy, eighty, and even ninety seconds on special occasion. A\r\nfully substantiated instance is reported from Manaar of an Arab diver\r\nhaving remained 109 seconds in seven fathoms of water. This occurred\r\nApril 13, 1887, and was witnessed and reported[105] by Captain James\r\nDonnan, the inspector of the fishery. Wellsted reports[106] a diving\r\ncontest in the Persian Gulf in which only one man, of the hundreds who\r\ncompeted, remained down 110 seconds; the depth, however, is not noted.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous reports of much longer stays than these; indeed, a\r\nstudy of the published evidence bearing upon the subject furnishes\r\nsurprising results. Ribeiro wrote, in 1685, that a diver could remain\r\nbelow while two _credos_ were repeated: “_Il s’y tient l’espace de deux\r\ncredo._”[107] In his interesting account of the Ceylon fishery, Percival\r\nstated that the usual length of time for divers to remain under water\r\n“does not much exceed two minutes, yet there are instances known of\r\ndivers who could remain four or even five minutes, which was the case\r\nwith a Caffre boy the last year I visited the fishery. The longest\r\ninstance ever known was of a diver who came from Anjango in 1797, and\r\nwho absolutely remained under water full six minutes.”[108] Le Beck\r\nsays, that in 1797, he saw a diver from Karikal remain down for the\r\nspace of seven minutes.[109] The merchant traveler, Jean Chardin,\r\nreported in 1711 that the divers remain up to seven and a half minutes\r\nunder water: “_Les plongeurs qui pêchent les perles sont quelquefois\r\njusqu’à demi-quart-d’heure sous l’eau._”[110]\r\n\r\nIn 1667, the Royal Society of London addressed an inquiry on this\r\nsubject to Sir Philiberto Vernatti, the British Resident at Batavia in\r\nthe East Indies. Vernatti’s reply gave certain details regarding the\r\nCeylon fishery, but did not touch upon the length of diving because, as\r\nhe stated, he could not “meet with any one that can satisfy me, and\r\nbeing unsatisfied myself, I cannot nor will obtrude anything upon you\r\nwhich may hereafter prove fabulous; but shall still serve you with\r\ntruth.”[111] Two years later, and presumably after investigation,\r\nVernatti reported: “The greatest length of time that pearl-divers in\r\nthese parts can continue under water is about a quarter of an hour; and\r\nthat by no other means than custom; for pearl-diving lasts not above six\r\nweeks, and the divers stay a great while longer at the end of the season\r\nthan at the beginning.”[112]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photograph, Underwood & Underwood, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY, MOHAMMED ALI, SHAH OF PERSIA\r\n\r\n  Wearing the Kajar crown\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe anatomist Diemerbroeck relates[113] the case of a pearl diver who,\r\nunder his own observation, remained half an hour at a time under water\r\nwhile pursuing his work; and this was seriously adopted without comment\r\nby John Mason Goode in his “Study of Medicine.”[114] Ibn Batuta, “the\r\nDoctor of Tangier,” wrote about 1336 that “some remain down an hour,\r\nothers two hours, others less.”[115] A still earlier writer, Jouchanan\r\nibn Masouiah,[116] in his book on stones, states that “the diver, when\r\nhe dives, places upon his nose a _masfâsa_ lest water should enter into\r\nhim, and breathes through the fissure, and remains under water for half\r\nan hour.” According to Sebaldus Rau[117] this _masfâsa_ was an article\r\nresembling a hood or cap, which the diver placed over his nose. It was\r\nmade of some impervious material and had a projection so long that it\r\nreached to the surface of the water. The same writer believes that this\r\nobject was alluded to by Aristotle (“De part. animal.,” _Lib._ II, c.\r\n16), where he likens the trunk of the elephant to the instrument used by\r\ncertain divers for aiding their respiration, so that they could remain\r\nlonger in the water and draw in air from above the surface.[118] And\r\nhere we cease pursuit of further records, lest our faith in recorded\r\ntestimony be too severely tested.[119]\r\n\r\nA superficial inspection of the above evidence, from the one or two\r\nhours noted by Ibn Batuta about the year 1336, to the half an hour of\r\nDiemerbroeck in 1672, the quarter of an hour of Vernatti in 1669, the\r\nseven and one half minutes of Chardin in 1711, the six minutes of\r\nPercival in 1803, to the 110 seconds of the present time, seems to\r\nindicate very clearly a gradual but somewhat remarkable decrease in the\r\nability of the Asiatic divers, and that the pearl fishermen of the\r\npresent day are very different creatures from their ancestors. And\r\nespecially is this so when it is considered that the above records are\r\nnot isolated reports selected for the particular purpose of showing a\r\ndecrease in the length of diving; on the contrary they are authoritative\r\nand representative publications of their respective periods. We do not\r\nrecall having seen in any report issued previous to 1675, an intimation\r\nthat the limit of time was less than ten minutes.\r\n\r\nHowever, a careful consideration of the subject leads to the belief that\r\nthere has been no serious decrease in the length of time that the Arab\r\nand Indian divers remain under water, and that either the writers were\r\nmisinformed or that the individual cases reported were extremely\r\nexceptional. Ibn Batuta’s instance of one to two hours could easily be\r\ncaused by a mistake in copying Arabic manuscript, or in the translation.\r\nThe case related by Diemerbroeck in which a pearl diver remained\r\nsubmerged half an hour, is more perplexing, especially as the physician\r\nreports that this was done under his own observation. The numerous\r\nreports of five or six minutes may have been based on a very exceptional\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThese statements are viewed as highly incredible by men who have spent\r\nscores of years at the fisheries. A man may remain submerged for several\r\nminutes, but the conditions are vastly different from the activities of\r\npearl-gathering at a depth of ten fathoms, where the pressure of the\r\nwater is nearly thirty pounds to the square inch, and the slightest\r\nexercise is fatiguing. Unless the time is taken by a watch, it is easy\r\nto overestimate the stay; the seconds pass very slowly when one is\r\nwaiting momentarily for the appearance of the diver’s head above the\r\nwater, and certainly to the nearly exhausted fisherman with straining\r\nchest and palpitating heart, the last few seconds must seem extremely\r\nlong indeed. An instance is noted in which an Arab diver remained\r\nsubmerged seventy-one seconds, and on his reappearance, naïvely inquired\r\nif he had not been down ten minutes. It seems doubtful whether the 110\r\nseconds herein noted has been greatly exceeded, in recent years at\r\nleast, by Arab or Indian divers, who do not appear to equal the\r\nsemi-amphibious natives of the South Sea islands in their exploits.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious features of the pearling industry is the manner\r\nin which the fishermen secure supplies of drinking water. In the\r\nvicinity of Bahrein, numerous fresh-water springs exist at the bottom of\r\nthe gulf in depths of two or three fathoms, and the fishermen dive into\r\nthe depth of the salt water down to where the fresh water is springing\r\nforth and there fill a skin or other suitable receptacle which they\r\nbring to the surface. By running a pipe down near the bottom in the\r\nvicinity of one of these springs, an abundance of fresh water may be\r\npumped into the boat.\r\n\r\nThree species—or at least three varieties—of pearl-bearing oysters are\r\nobtained in the Persian Gulf. These are known locally as _mahar_,\r\n_sudaifee_, and _zinni_. Of these, the _mahar_ or Lingah oyster, which\r\ncorresponds to the Ceylon pearl-oyster, yields the greatest quantity of\r\npearls, and those of the finest quality. It measures three or three and\r\na half inches in diameter, and is found in deeper water than the others.\r\nThe _sudaifee_ and the _zinni_, which are larger, yield pearls in much\r\nsmaller quantities than the _mahar_.\r\n\r\nOn large boats, which remain out for two or three weeks at a time, the\r\noysters are left on deck overnight, and the following morning they are\r\nopened by means of a curved knife (_miflaket_), four or five inches in\r\nlength. The smaller boats working near shore convey the catch to the\r\nland for the opening and searching for pearls.\r\n\r\nThe Persian Gulf pearls are commonly not so white as those from Ceylon,\r\nbut they are found of larger size, and it is believed in Asia that they\r\nretain their luster for a greater length of time. Many of the Persian\r\nGulf pearls, especially those from _sudaifee_ and _zinni_ shells, have a\r\ndistinctly yellow color. Tavernier made a curious explanation of this.\r\nHe stated:\r\n\r\n  As for the pearls tending to yellow, the color is due to the fact\r\n  that the fishermen sell the oysters in heaps, and the merchants\r\n  awaiting sometimes up to 14 or 15 days till the shells open of\r\n  themselves, in order to extract the pearls, some of these oysters\r\n  lose their water during this time, decay, and become putrid, and the\r\n  pearls become yellow by contact. This is so true that in all oysters\r\n  which have retained their water, the pearls are always white. They\r\n  are allowed to open of themselves, because if they are opened by\r\n  force, as we open our oysters in the shell, the pearls may be\r\n  damaged and broken. The oysters of the Manar Strait open of\r\n  themselves, 5 or 6 days sooner than those of the Gulf of Persia,\r\n  because the heat is much greater at Manar, which is at the tenth\r\n  degree of North latitude, while the island of Bahrein is at about\r\n  the twenty-seventh. And consequently among the pearls which come\r\n  from Manar there are few yellow ones found.[120]\r\n\r\nTavernier was more familiar with the pearls themselves than with the\r\nmethods of the fishery. The yellow color is not due to contact with the\r\nputrefactive flesh, and is independent of the manner of opening. In\r\nfact, if putrefaction caused the yellow color, this shade would be far\r\nmore prevalent in the Manaar or Ceylon pearls than in those from\r\nBahrein, for practically all of the Ceylon oysters are permitted to\r\nputrefy, whereas only a portion of those in the Persian Gulf are opened\r\nin this manner. Furthermore, notwithstanding that it is nearer the\r\nequator, the heat at Manaar during the pearling season is not to be\r\ncompared with that at Bahrein when the season is at its height, for the\r\nPersian Gulf during July and August is notorious as one of the hottest\r\nplaces on the globe.\r\n\r\nWhile the great bulk of the pearls are either white or yellowish, these\r\nfisheries yield a few pink, bluish, gray, and occasionally even black\r\npearls. These unusual colors are not especially prized. A curious and\r\nremarkably detailed story has gone the rounds in which the qualities of\r\nPersian and Ceylon pearls are compared, to the disparagement of the\r\nlatter, and during the last hundred years few accounts have been\r\npublished of this fishery without recording it. We notice it first in\r\nMorier’s “Journey through Persia in 1808 and 1809,”[121] but possibly it\r\nantedated that report. The statement is that the pearls of Ceylon peel\r\noff, while those of Persia are as “firm as the rock on which they grow”;\r\nand though they lose in color and luster one per cent. annually for\r\nfifty years, they still lose less than those of Ceylon, and at the\r\nexpiration of the fifty years they cease to diminish in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe pearl output in the Persian Gulf at the present time appears from\r\nthe official returns to exceed four million dollars annually at local\r\nvaluation. The exports in 1903 were reported at £827,447, and in 1904,\r\n£1,077,241. It is generally understood that all of the pearls are not\r\nentered in the official figures, and the valuations in the markets of\r\nAsia and Europe are greatly in excess of these amounts. The profits of\r\nthe fishery are divided among a great number of persons. A large\r\npercentage goes to the shrewd _bunnias_ from India, who finance the\r\nfishery operations, and who, by all sorts of tricks connected with\r\nadvances of supplies, valuation of the catch, etc., manage to make a\r\nvery good thing out of the business. It is nothing unusual for the\r\nvaluation of a lot of pearls to double and even treble after leaving the\r\nhands of the fishermen.\r\n\r\nWhile many of the gulf pearls—and especially of the small seed-pearls—go\r\nto Bagdad, the great bulk of them are sold to representatives of Hindu\r\nand Arab merchants of Bombay for shipment to that city, which to the\r\nBahrein fisherman is the heart of the outside world. Few of the pearls\r\ngo directly into Arabia or Persia, as the certain sale in the larger\r\nBombay market is preferable to a sometimes higher but less regular price\r\nin other markets. Indeed, pearls may usually be purchased at a less cost\r\nin India than a stranger would be obliged to pay at Bahrein. The Bombay\r\nmerchants “sow the earth with Orient pearl,” dealing direct with London,\r\nParis and Berlin, and with the oriental jewelers. Most of the yellow\r\npearls find oriental purchasers, with whose dark complexions they\r\nharmonize better than the silvery white ones. They are also more popular\r\nbecause of a belief existing throughout the East that they are less\r\nlikely to lose their luster with the lapse of years.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the pearl-oysters is not used locally, but large quantities\r\nare exported to Europe for manufacture. Although it is the smallest and\r\ncheapest produced in the gulf, yet, owing to the enormous quantity taken\r\nfor their pearls, the shell of the _mahar_ (_Margaritifera vulgaris_)\r\nconstitutes the bulk of the exports. Formerly most of the shipments were\r\nmade from the harbor of Lingah, hence it is known in the markets of\r\nEurope as “Lingah shell.” But in the last three or four years, much of\r\nit has been transported to Europe via Bander Abbas and Bushire. A German\r\nfirm at Bahrein is extensively employed in exporting this shell, and\r\nseveral Indian merchants are also engaged in the trade. The total\r\nexports in 1906 amounted to 3262 tons, valued at $26,408 according to\r\nthe port returns, but worth about $135,000 in Europe. Very large\r\nquantities are received in London, and over 2500 tons have been offered\r\nat auction in a single year. This shell is very small, averaging about\r\nthree inches in diameter and about one and a half ounces in weight. It\r\nis the cheapest of all mother-of-pearl. The best quality sells in London\r\nfor ten to twenty shillings per hundredweight, but the ordinary grade is\r\nworth usually less than nine shillings, and sometimes as low as three\r\nshillings per hundredweight. America formerly imported it, but few lots\r\nhave been received since the exploitation of the Mississippi shell about\r\nfifteen years ago.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the larger species of pearl-oysters in the Persian Gulf is\r\nworth considerably more than the “Lingah shell,” selling in Europe for\r\n£12 to £60 per ton, yet manufacturers consider it as furnishing only\r\npoor qualities of mother-of-pearl. Several hundred tons are exported\r\nannually. It measures six or seven inches in diameter and is used\r\nprincipally in making cheap grades of buttons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CEYLON\r\n\r\n         Errors, like straws, upon the surface flow;\r\n         He who would search for pearls must dive below.\r\n\r\n                             DRYDEN, _All for Love_, Prologue.\r\n\r\nSecond in extent to those of Persia only, are the intermittent and\r\nuncertain pearl fisheries of the Gulf of Manaar. This is an arm of the\r\nIndian Ocean, from 65 to 150 miles in width, separating the island of\r\nCeylon from the southernmost part of India. The pearl-oyster banks—known\r\nlocally as paars—are situated off the northwest coast of Ceylon and also\r\nin the vicinity of Tuticorin on the Madras coast of the mainland. The\r\nCeylon fisheries are under the control of the colonial government of the\r\nBritish Empire, and those of the mainland are monopolized by the Madras\r\ngovernment. Notwithstanding the fact that they are outside of the\r\nthree-mile limit established as the bound of national jurisdiction,\r\nexclusive privileges are exercised over these fisheries by the\r\nrespective governments,[122] and poaching vessels are liable to seizure\r\nand punishment.\r\n\r\nThough possibly not so ancient as those of Persia, the Ceylon pearl\r\nfisheries are of great antiquity. References to them occur in Cingalese\r\nrecords dating from 550 B.C. Pliny, Ptolemy, Strabo, and other ancient\r\nwriters speak of their importance.\r\n\r\nThe “Periplus of the Erythræan”—written about the end of the second\r\ncentury A.D.—refers to these fisheries, and states that, owing to the\r\ndangers involved, it was customary to employ convicts therein. In the\r\ndays of the “Arabian Nights,” under the name “Serendib,” this was the\r\nscene of the pearling adventures of Sindbad the Sailor, and the\r\nreputation of the valuable pearl resources is reflected in those\r\nwonderful tales.\r\n\r\nThe first extensive description we have of the Gulf of Manaar fisheries\r\nwas given by the Venetian traveler, Marco Polo, who visited the region\r\nabout 1294. He wrote:\r\n\r\n  The pearl fishers take their vessels, great and small, and proceed\r\n  into the gulf where they stop from the beginning of April till the\r\n  middle of May. They go first to a place called Bettelar, and then go\r\n  60 miles into the Gulf. Here they cast anchor and shift from their\r\n  large vessels into small boats. You must know that the many\r\n  merchants who go divide into various companies, and each of these\r\n  must engage a number of men on wages, hiring them for April and half\r\n  of May. Of all the produce they have first to pay the king, as his\r\n  royalty, the tenth part. And they must also pay those men who charm\r\n  the great fishes to prevent them from injuring the divers whilst\r\n  engaged in seeking pearls under water, one-twentieth of all that\r\n  they take. These fish-charmers are termined _Abraiaman_; and their\r\n  charm holds good for that day only, for at night they dissolve the\r\n  charm so that the fishes can work mischief at their will. These\r\n  _Abraiaman_ know also how to charm beasts and birds and every living\r\n  thing. When the men have got into the small boats they jump into the\r\n  water and dive to the bottom, which may be at a depth of from 4 to\r\n  12 fathoms, and there they remain as long as they are able. And\r\n  there they find the shells that contain the pearls, and those they\r\n  put into a net bag tied round the waist, and mount up to the surface\r\n  with them, and then dive anew. When they can’t hold their breath any\r\n  longer they come up again, and after a little down they go once\r\n  more, and so they go on all day. These shells are in fashion like\r\n  oysters or sea-hoods. And in these shells are found pearls, great\r\n  and small, of every kind, sticking in the flesh of the shell-fish.\r\n  In this manner pearls are fished in great quantities, for thence in\r\n  fact come the pearls which are spread all over the world. And I can\r\n  tell you the King of that State hath a very great receipt and\r\n  treasure from his dues upon those pearls.[123]\r\n\r\nThat quaint old missionary bishop, Friar Jordanus, in his “Mirabilia\r\nDescripta, or the Wonders of the East” (_circa_ 1330), reports that\r\n“more than 8000 boats” were sometimes employed for three months\r\ncontinually in these fisheries, which were then prosecuted under the\r\njurisdiction of the Cingalese kings of Kandy, and that the quantity of\r\npearls taken was “astounding and almost incredible.”[124]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE “PRINCE OF PEARLS”: THE LATE RANA OF DHOLPUR IN HIS PEARL REGALIA\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis number of boats seems entirely too large, especially in view of the\r\nfact that Jordanus secured his information at second hand; but it leaves\r\nthe impression that the fisheries of that period were of great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nWhen the Portuguese, attracted by the wealth of its resources, obtained\r\ncontrol of this region about 1510, they exacted from the local rulers an\r\nannual tribute in pearls and spices. Later they conducted the fisheries\r\non their own account, permitting the native fishermen to retain one\r\nfourth of the catch as compensation for their work, and dividing the\r\nremainder into three equal portions, for the king, the church, and the\r\nsoldiers, respectively.\r\n\r\nLinschoten, who visited India about 1590, leaves this interesting\r\naccount of the fishery at that time:\r\n\r\n  “There are also other fishings for pearle, as between the Iland of\r\n  Seylon, and the Cape de Comoriin, where great numbers are yearlie\r\n  found, for that the King of Portingale hath a captaine there with\r\n  soldiers that looketh unto it; they have yearlie at the least above\r\n  3 or 4 thousand duckers [divers], yt live onlie by fishing for\r\n  pearles, and so maintaine themselves.” He describes the methods of\r\n  fishing, which appear to be similar to those of the present time,\r\n  and adds: “When they have made an end of the day’s fishing, all the\r\n  fishers with the captaine, soldiers, laborers and watchmen for the\r\n  king, goe together, and taking all the pearls [pearl-oysters] that\r\n  are caught that day they divide them into certaine heaps, that is,\r\n  one part for the king, another part for the captaine and soldiers,\r\n  the third part for the Jesuits, because they have their Cloyster in\r\n  that place, and brought the countrie first into the Christian faith,\r\n  and the last part for the Fishers, which is done with Justice and\r\n  Equalitie. This fishing is done in the Summer tyme, and there\r\n  passeth not any yeare but that divers Fishers are drowned by the\r\n  Cape de Comoriin (which is called the King’s fishing) and manie\r\n  devoured by fishes, so that when the fishing is done there is great\r\n  and pitiful noyse and cry of women and children heard. Yet the next\r\n  yeare they must do the same work againe, for that they have no other\r\n  means to live, as also for that they are partlie compelled thereunto\r\n  by the Portingales, but most part because of the gaine.”[125]\r\n\r\nThe best description we have seen of the Ceylon fisheries at the time of\r\nthe Portuguese occupation, is that of Caesar Frederick, a Venetian\r\ntrader, who referred to the period from 1563 to 1581. Frederick\r\nreported, according to Hickocke’s translation in the Hakluyt edition:\r\n\r\n  The sea that lieth between the coast which descendeth from Cao\r\n  Comori, to the lowe land of Chilao, and from Island Zeilan, they\r\n  call the fishing of Pearles, which fishing they make every yeare,\r\n  beginning in March or April, and it lasteth fiftie dayes, but they\r\n  doe not fishe every yeere in one place, but one yeere in one place,\r\n  and another yeere in another place of the same sea. When the time of\r\n  this fishing draweth neere, they send very good Divers, that goe to\r\n  discover where the greatest heapes of Oisters bee under water, and\r\n  right agaynst that place where greatest store of Oisters bee, there\r\n  they make or plant a village with houses and a Bazaro, which\r\n  standeth as long as the fishing time lasteth, and it is furnished\r\n  with all things necessarie, and nowe and then it is neere unto\r\n  places that are inhabited, and other times farre off, according to\r\n  the place where they fishe. The fishermen are all Christians of the\r\n  countrey, and who so will may goe to fishing, paying a certain dutie\r\n  to the king of Portugall, and to the Churches of the Friers of Saint\r\n  Paule, which are in that coast. All the while that they are fishing,\r\n  there are three or foure Fustes armed to defend the Fishermen from\r\n  Rovers. It was my chance to bee there one time in my passage, and I\r\n  saw the order that they used in fishing, which is this. There are\r\n  three or foure Barkes that make consort together, which are like to\r\n  our litle Pilot boates, and a little lesse, there goe seven or eight\r\n  men in a boate: and I have seene in a morning a great number of them\r\n  goe out, and anker in fifteene or eighteene fadome of water, which\r\n  is the ordinarie depth of all that coast. When they are at anker,\r\n  they cast a rope into the sea, and at the end of the rope, they make\r\n  fast a great stone, and then there is readie a man that hath his\r\n  nose and his eares well stopped, and annointed with oyle, and a\r\n  basket about his necke, or under his left arme, then he goeth downe\r\n  by the rope to the bottome of the Sea, and as fast as he can hee\r\n  filleth the basket, and when it is full, he shaketh the rope, and\r\n  his fellows that are in the Barke hale him up with the basket: and\r\n  in such wise they go one by one untill they have laden their barke\r\n  with oysters, and at evening they come to the village, and then\r\n  every company maketh their mountaine or heape of oysters one distant\r\n  from another, in such wise that you shall see a great long rowe of\r\n  mountaines or heapes of oysters, and they are not touched until such\r\n  time as the fishing bee ended, and at the ende of the fishing every\r\n  companie sitteth round about their mountaine or heape of oysters,\r\n  and fall to opening of them, which they may easilie doe because they\r\n  bee dead, drie and brittle: and if every oyster had pearles in them,\r\n  it would be a very good purchase, but there are very many that have\r\n  no pearles in them: when the fishing is ended, then they see whether\r\n  it bee a good gathering or a badde: there are certaine expert in the\r\n  pearles whom they call Chitini, which set and make the price of\r\n  pearles according to their carracts [carats or weight], beautie, and\r\n  goodnesse, making foure sorts of them. The first sort bee the round\r\n  pearles, and they bee called Aia of Portugale, because the\r\n  Portugales doe buy them. The second sorte which are not round, are\r\n  called Aia of Bengala. The third sort which are not so good as the\r\n  second, they call Aia of Canara, that is to say, the kingdome of\r\n  Bezeneger. The fourth and last sort, which are the least and worst\r\n  sort, are called Aia of Cambaia. Thus the price being set, there are\r\n  merchants of every countrey which are readie with their money in\r\n  their handes, so that in a fewe dayes all is brought up at the\r\n  prises set according to the goodnesse and caracts of the\r\n  pearles.[126]\r\n\r\nA remarkable instance of the immutability of custom in the Orient is\r\nfound in the fact that, except in a few minor particulars, Frederick’s\r\naccount, written more than three centuries ago, could serve as a\r\ndescription of the methods of the fisheries in recent years. The\r\nindustry was then very extensive, as appears from an account shortly\r\nafterward (about 1608) by Pedro Teixeira, who reported[127] that from\r\n400 to 500 boats were employed, and from 50,000 to 60,000 persons\r\nresorted to the fishery.\r\n\r\nIn 1658, possession of Ceylon and India passed from the Portuguese to\r\nthe Dutch, who for a time continued the pearl fisheries after the manner\r\npractised by their predecessors; but owing to contentions as to the\r\ndetails of management, they soon resorted to leasing them each year to\r\nthe highest bidder, or to several bidders, for a definite money payment.\r\nThe successful bidders prosecuted the industry in the same manner as the\r\ngovernment had previously done, employing the same native fishermen and\r\ncompensating them with one fourth of the oysters secured. Under the\r\nDutch rule the fisheries were very unprofitable, and particularly so\r\nduring the last seventy years of their authority. There was practically\r\nno fishing from 1732 to 1746, and there was also a suspension—but not\r\nentirely from lack of oysters or of pearls—from 1768 until the territory\r\npassed into the control of the British in 1796.\r\n\r\nThe colonial government of the British Empire continued the Dutch policy\r\nof leasing, only restricting the limits of territory and season for\r\nfishing. Many objections were found to this method. It was difficult to\r\nregulate the business properly, and there were no reliable means of\r\ndetermining its proceeds and conditions. At length in 1835, the\r\ngovernment began to operate the fishery on its own account, as the\r\nPortuguese had done two hundred years before, allowing the fishermen one\r\nfourth of the oysters taken by them and selling the remaining three\r\nfourths for the benefit of the treasury. In this way the full value of\r\nthe resources was realized without mystery, deception, or concealment,\r\nand the plan worked satisfactorily for all concerned.\r\n\r\nOwing, presumably, to the long period in which they had lain\r\nundisturbed, the Ceylon oyster reefs were in excellent condition at the\r\nbeginning of British rule. In 1796 the government derived a revenue of\r\nRs.1,100,000 therefrom, and in 1797 the revenue was Rs.1,400,000; these\r\ntwo years were by far the most productive during the first century of\r\nBritish occupation.\r\n\r\nSeveral very interesting reports on the industry were prepared about\r\nthat time. Especially to be noted among these were the accounts by Henry\r\nJ. LeBeck in 1798;[128] by Robert Percival in 1803;[129] and by James\r\nCordiner in 1807,[130] to which reference is made for detailed accounts\r\nof the fisheries of that period.\r\n\r\nThe Ceylon fishery was prosecuted about every other year from 1799 to\r\n1809, and the annual returns ranged from £15,022 in 1801 to £84,257 in\r\n1808. From 1810 to 1813, inclusive, there was a blank so far as receipts\r\nwere concerned. In 1814 the fishery was very good, bringing in a revenue\r\nof £105,187. With the exception of very slight returns in 1815, 1816,\r\nand 1820, no oysters were then obtained until 1828. Excepting 1832 and\r\n1834, the industry was prosecuted each year from 1828 to 1837, the\r\nrevenue to the government averaging about £30,000 annually. Then came a\r\nlong blank of seventeen years, for there was no fishing from 1838 to\r\n1854, and likewise from 1864 to 1873. Indeed, so depleted had the beds\r\nthroughout the Gulf of Manaar become in 1866, that serious consideration\r\nwas given to the possibilities of securing seed oysters from the Persian\r\nGulf for restocking the reefs; but fortunately this was rendered\r\nunnecessary by the discovery soon afterward of a few oysters on several\r\nreefs on both the Ceylon and the Malabar coasts.\r\n\r\nFrom 1855 to 1863, and also from 1874 to 1881, the returns were only\r\nordinary, the highest being £51,017 in 1863, and £59,868 in 1881,—the\r\nbest year since 1814; and during these two periods fishing was entirely\r\nomitted in nearly one half the seasons. There were five lean years from\r\n1882 to 1886, and the 1887 fishery was only fair, with a yield of\r\n£39,609. But the returns for 1888 were large, amounting to £80,424; and\r\nthose for 1891 were even greater, being £96,370, representing a yield of\r\n44,311,441 oysters. No oysters were caught from 1892 to 1902, inclusive.\r\nIn 1903, the fishery was profitable, yielding 41,180,137 oysters, and\r\nthe share of the government amounted to £55,303; and in 1904 the yield\r\nwas almost the same, being 41,039,085 oysters and a revenue of £71,050\r\nto the government.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 occurred the greatest fishery in the modern history of Ceylon.\r\nThe season extended from February 20 until April 21, giving forty-seven\r\nworking days, exclusive of Sundays and five days of bad weather, the\r\nlongest period in over half a century.[131] The boats employed numbered\r\n318, with 4991 divers and 4894 attendant _manduks_. The yield of oysters\r\nexceeded all records, amounting to 81,580,716 in number, or nearly twice\r\nas many as in any previous year within the period of British occupation.\r\nThe prices at which these sold ranged from Rs.24 to Rs.124 per thousand,\r\nwith an average of Rs.48.89 for the entire season. The government\r\nreceived Rs.2,510,727 as its share of the revenue, which was twice as\r\nmuch as in any previous year since the British have been in control, and\r\ndoubtless the largest received by any government in the history of the\r\nindustry. The oysters falling to the share of the divers must have sold\r\nfor at least Rs.1,255,363 (since 1881 the divers have received one third\r\nof the catch as their compensation, instead of one fourth). The profits\r\nof the merchants, who purchased and opened the government oysters as\r\nwell as those of the divers, doubtless amounted to fully as much, making\r\na total of Rs.5,021,453, or nearly $2,000,000 as a low estimate of the\r\nlocal value of the pearls secured at Ceylon in 1905.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great success in 1905, an enormous number of persons\r\nflocked to the camp at the beginning of the season in 1906. Employment\r\nwas given to 473 boats, the largest number on record, and over 8600\r\ndivers were engaged, with an equal number of attendants. Owing to\r\nunfavorable weather and the great quantity of oysters removed in 1905,\r\nthe catch in 1906 was less than in that record year, amounting to\r\n67,150,641 in number, from the sale of which Rs.1,376,746 was realized.\r\nThe prices covered a wide range. For the large Cheval oysters, even\r\nRs.276, Rs.291, and Rs.309 per 1000 were received. The inferior, stunted\r\noysters from the Muttuvaratu paar ranged from Rs.20 to Rs.41 per 1000,\r\nand even at these prices many buyers sustained losses. On the other hand\r\nconsiderable money was made by the buyers of those from Cheval, in which\r\nsome very large and beautiful pearls were found.\r\n\r\nThe results of the 1907 fishery were surprisingly good, excellent prices\r\nbeing obtained. The proceeds from the sale of two thirds of the\r\n21,000,000 oysters amounted to Rs.1,040,000, or just under $350,000. The\r\nfishery lasted thirty-six working days. Only 173 boats were used, as it\r\nwas considered that a fleet of this size is fully as large as can be\r\nemployed advantageously to the greatest satisfaction of all interested.\r\n\r\nAccording to the compilations of the colonial secretary’s office, the\r\ngross revenue to the government from 1796 to 1907, inclusive, amounted\r\nto £2,098,830. If to this be added the fishermen’s share and the\r\nmerchants’ compensation, we have a total of about £4,200,000 or\r\n$21,000,000 as the local value of the pearls produced in Ceylon during\r\nthe period of British occupation. The value of these in the markets of\r\nAsia and Europe was undoubtedly very much greater.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the Ceylon pearl fisheries are the most interesting in\r\nthe world. Owing to their ready accessibility and thorough organization,\r\nthey are far better known than any others. Reliable data exist as to the\r\nnumber of oysters taken during each season since 1854, and it is\r\npossible to estimate roughly the pearls obtained therefrom. Throughout\r\nthe 112 years of British occupation, and previously to some extent under\r\nthe successive rule of the Cingalese kings, of the Portuguese, and of\r\nthe Dutch, for centuries, the reefs were annually examined by official\r\ninspectors, and fishing was permitted only in those years when they\r\nappeared in satisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nA noticeable feature of these fisheries is their uncertainty, a\r\nprosperous season being followed by an absence of fishing sometimes\r\nextending over ten years or more. This is not of recent development.\r\nOver eight hundred years ago a total cessation of yield for a\r\nconsiderable period was recorded[132] by Albyrouni, who served under\r\nMahmud of Ghazni. He stated that, in the eleventh century, the oysters\r\nwhich formerly existed in the Gulf of Serendib (Ceylon) disappeared\r\nsimultaneously with the appearance of a fishery at Sofala in the country\r\nof the Zends, where previously the existence of pearls had been unknown;\r\nhence it was conjectured that the pearl-oysters of Serendib had migrated\r\nto Sofala.\r\n\r\nIn the 249 years since Ceylon passed from the dominion of the Portuguese\r\nin 1658, there have been only sixty-nine years in which the pearl\r\nfisheries were prosecuted. During the last century there were only\r\nthirty-six regularly authorized fisheries. Enormous quantities of\r\noysters have appeared on the reefs, giving rise to hopes of great\r\nresults, only to end in disappointment, owing to their complete\r\ndisappearance. In the fall of 1887, for instance, examination of one of\r\nthe reefs revealed an enormous quantity of oysters, covering an area\r\nfive miles in length by one and a half miles in width, with “600 to 700\r\noysters to the square yard” in places. It was estimated by the\r\ninspection officials that there were 164,000,000 oysters, which exceeded\r\nthe total number taken in the preceding sixty years, and which should\r\nhave yielded several million dollars’ worth of pearls in the following\r\nseason, according to the usual returns. But some months later not an\r\noyster was to be found on this large reef, the great host presumably\r\nhaving been destroyed by action of the sea. Numerous reasons are\r\nassigned for the failure of promising reefs. Those most frequently heard\r\nare that the currents sweep the oysters away, that they are devoured by\r\npredaceous enemies, that they are covered by the shifting bottom, or\r\nthat they voluntarily move to new grounds.\r\n\r\nThe oysters are found in well-known and permanently located banks or\r\npaars in the upper end of the Gulf of Manaar, in the wide shallow\r\nplateau off the northwest end of the island and directly south of Adams\r\nBridge. The hard calcrete bottom is formed mostly of sand combined with\r\norganic remains in a compact mass and with more or less coral and shell\r\ndeposits. The density of the water, as determined by Professor Herdman\r\n(to whose important and valuable report[133] we are indebted for much\r\ninformation), is fairly constant at 1.023, and the temperature has a\r\nnormal range of from 82° to 86° F. during the greater part of the year.\r\nThe charts and records refer to about twenty paars, but most of these\r\nhave never yielded extensively, either to the English or to the Dutch.\r\nIn the aggregate, they cover an area fifty miles in length and twenty\r\nmiles in width. Most of them are from five to twenty miles from the\r\nshore, and at a depth of five to ten fathoms. The principal paars are\r\nCheval, Madaragam, Periya, Muttuvaratu, Karativu, Vankalai, Chilaw, and\r\nCondatchy. Only three have afforded profitable fisheries in recent\r\nyears, _i. e._: Cheval, Madaragam and Muttuvaratu.\r\n\r\nThe other paars are of practically no economic value at the present\r\ntime. They become populated with tens of millions of oysters, which\r\nmysteriously disappear before they are old enough for gathering.\r\nEspecially is this true of the Periya paar, which is about fifteen miles\r\nfrom the shore, and runs eleven miles north and south, varying from one\r\nto two miles in width. Frequently this is found covered with young\r\noysters, which almost invariably disappear before the next inspection,\r\nowing, probably, to their being covered by the shifting bottom caused by\r\nthe southwest monsoon. The natives call this the “Mother paar,” under\r\nthe impression that these oysters migrate to the other paars.\r\n\r\nThe Ceylon government has given very careful attention to all matters\r\naffecting the prosperity of the pearl resources. It has maintained a\r\n“Pearl Fishery Establishment,” consisting of a superintendent, an\r\ninspector and numerous divers, attendants, and sailors. The inspector\r\nexamines the paars, determines when and to what extent they should be\r\nfished, and directs the operations. The superintendent conducts the work\r\non shore, divides and sells the oysters, etc. The expense of this\r\nestablishment has approximated $40,000 per annum when there has been a\r\nfishery, and about $22,500 without fishery expenses.\r\n\r\nIt has been decided by naturalists that Ceylon oysters less than four\r\nyears old produce very few marketable pearls; in the fifth, and again in\r\nthe sixth year the value of the yield doubles, and in the seventh it is\r\nsupposed to increase fourfold. Beyond that age there appears to be\r\nlittle increase, and there is the risk of the oysters dying, and of the\r\npearls deteriorating or becoming lost. Eight years seems to be the\r\nnatural limit of life. While experience has shown that the most\r\nprofitable period for taking the pearl-oysters is when they are from\r\nfive to seven years old, the mollusks are liable to disappear,\r\nespecially after the fifth year, and the danger of waiting too long is\r\nas great as that of beginning too early. The fishing on any particular\r\nbank is determined by various circumstances and conditions, and is\r\npermitted only after careful examination.\r\n\r\nThe different beds are inspected from time to time, and no fishing is\r\npermitted until the condition of the pearl-oysters on the particular\r\nreef thrown open seems to warrant the most valuable returns. In the\r\nexamination of a bed apparently in suitable condition, several thousand\r\noysters—usually eight or ten thousand—are taken up and the pearls found\r\ntherein are examined and valued. If they average Rs.25 or Rs.30 per\r\nthousand oysters, profitable results may be expected, provided there is\r\na sufficient quantity of oysters on the bed. This method of determining\r\nthe fishery is very ancient. Tavernier wrote, about 1650, “before they\r\nfish, they try whether it will turn to any account by sending seven or\r\neight boats to bring 1000 oysters each, which they open, and if the\r\noysters per 1000 yield five _fanos_ or above, they then know the fishing\r\nwill turn to account.”[134] And much the same method was described by\r\nRibeiro in 1685.\r\n\r\nWhen it has been decided to hold a fishery, public notice is given by\r\nadvertisement, stating which of the many paars or reefs will be open,\r\nand the estimated quantity of oysters to be removed, the number of boats\r\nthat will be given employment, and the date for beginning the season and\r\nthe length of time it will probably last. This notice is usually given\r\nin December preceding the fishery, and it is the signal for preparation\r\nby tens of thousands of persons in this part of Asia, and especially on\r\nthe Madras and the Malabar coasts of India, and on the coast of Arabia.\r\nThe fishermen, the merchants, and the multitude of artisans, mechanics,\r\nand laborers who contribute to the industry, set their homes and\r\nbusiness in order so that they may attend. We give the notice issued in\r\n1907, both in Cingalese and in English.[135]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE LATE MAHARAJAH OF PATIALA\r\n]\r\n\r\nEarly in February the area to be gleaned is again examined, the limits\r\nof the oysters are charted and buoyed off, the number that may be\r\nobtained is estimated as accurately as possible, and valuation samples\r\nare collected. Several thousand oysters are taken up, the pearls are\r\nremoved, examined, and valued by uninterested experts, and the results\r\nare published, so that prospective buyers may have a reliable idea as to\r\ntheir value. Otherwise this would not be possible until the merchants\r\nhad washed some of their own purchases, which ordinarily would not be\r\nfor a week or ten days after the opening of the season.\r\n\r\nThe fishery usually begins late in February or early in March, as the\r\nsea is then relatively calm, the currents least perceptible, and there\r\nis less danger of storms. It is prosecuted from a temporary settlement\r\nor camp on the sandy shore at a place conveniently near the reefs. The\r\nimportant fisheries of the five years ending in 1907, were centered at\r\nthe improvised settlement known as Marichchikadde. Although prosecuted\r\nfrom the coast of Ceylon, relatively few Cingalese attend compared with\r\nthe large numbers who assemble from India, Arabia, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA week or two before the opening of the season, the boats begin to\r\narrive, sometimes fifty or more in a single day, laden with men, women\r\nand children, and in many cases with the materials for their huts. In a\r\nshort time the erstwhile desolate beach becomes populated with thousands\r\nof persons from all over the Indian littoral, and there is the noisy\r\ntraffic of congregated humanity, and a confusion of tongues where before\r\nonly the sound of the ocean waves was heard. Beside the eight or ten\r\nthousand fishermen, most of whom are Moormen, Tamils, and Arabs, there\r\nare pearl merchants—mainly Chetties and Moormen, boat repairers and\r\nother mechanics, provision dealers, priests, pawnbrokers, government\r\nofficials, koddu-counters, clerks, boat guards, a police force of 200\r\nofficials, coolies, domestic servants, with numbers of women and\r\nchildren. And for the entertainment of these, and to obtain a share of\r\nthe wealth from the sea, there are jugglers, fakirs, gamblers, beggars,\r\nfemale dancers, loose characters, with every allurement that appeals to\r\nthe sons of Brahma, Buddha or Mohammed. Natives from the seaport towns\r\nof India are there in thousands; the slender-limbed and\r\ndelicate-featured Cingalese with their scant attire and unique\r\nhead-dress; energetic Arabs from the Persian Gulf; burly Moormen, sturdy\r\nKandyans, outcast Veddahs, Chinese, Jews, Portuguese, Dutch,\r\nhalf-castes, the scum of the East and the riffraff of the Asiatic\r\nlittoral, the whole making up a temporary city of forty thousand or more\r\ninhabitants.[136]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   THE\r\n                     Ceylon Company of Pearl Fishers,\r\n                                 LIMITED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  NOTICE\r\n\r\n\r\n  Is hereby given that a Pearl Fishery will take place at\r\n  Marichchukkaddi, in the Island of Ceylon, on or about February 20,\r\n  1907.\r\n\r\n  The Banks to be fished are—\r\n\r\n  The Karativu, Dutch Moderagam and Alanturai Pars, estimated to contain\r\n  21,000,000 oysters, sufficient to employ 100 boats for twenty-one days\r\n  with average loads of 10,000 each per day.\r\n\r\n  The Northwest and Mid-West Cheval, estimated to contain 2,000,000\r\n  oysters, sufficient to employ 100 boats for two days with average\r\n  loads of 10,000 oysters.\r\n\r\n  The Muttuvaratu Par, estimated to contain 8,000,000 oysters,\r\n  sufficient to employ 100 boats for eight days with average loads as\r\n  before stated: each boat being fully manned with divers.\r\n\r\n  2. It is notified that fishing will begin on the first favourable day\r\n  after February 19. Conditions governing the employment of divers will\r\n  be issued separately.\r\n\r\n  3. Marichchukkaddi is on the mainland, eight miles by sea south of\r\n  Sillavaturai, and supplies of good water and provisions can be\r\n  obtained there.\r\n\r\n  4. The Fishery will be conducted on account of the Ceylon Company of\r\n  Pearl Fishers, Ltd., and the oysters put up to sale in such lots as\r\n  may be deemed expedient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA populous town springs up with well-planned and lighted streets and\r\nvast numbers of temporary abodes of all sorts, according to the means\r\nand the caste of the occupants, some of them just large enough for two\r\nor three persons to creep into. Although made mostly of poles, mats,\r\n_cajans_ or plaited fronds of the cocoanut tree, they furnish ample\r\nshelter for the locality and season, the uncertainty of the fishery from\r\nyear to year being sufficient argument against expensive and substantial\r\nbuildings. Numerous wells and cisterns yield water for the use of all.\r\nSanitary measures are strictly enforced, with a liberal use of\r\ndisinfectants. At a considerable distance southward from the settlement\r\nare constructed the private _toddis_, or inclosures, for decomposing the\r\noysters and washing the pearls therefrom. Nearer the camp or settlement\r\nitself are the police court, the jail, the bank, the post and telegraph\r\noffices, the auction room, the hospital and the cemetery—all to endure\r\nthrough a strenuous six weeks of toil and labor, of money-getting and\r\ngambling, and then the inhabitants “fold their tents like the Arabs, and\r\nsilently steal away,” leaving the debris to the shore-birds and the\r\njackals.\r\n\r\nThe fishing fleet consists of several hundred boats[137] of various rigs\r\nand sizes. These are interesting on account of their picturesque\r\nappearance and also their remarkable diversity of types in hull and\r\nrigging: there is the broad and roomy Jaffna dhoney, commonly painted\r\nblack; the lugger-like Paumben boat; the very narrow and speedy\r\ncanoes,—not unlike the single masted bugeyes of the Chesapeake\r\nregion—from Kilakarai and neighboring villages, most noticeable owing to\r\ntheir great number and their bright colors—red, green, or yellow; the\r\nclumsy looking, single masted Tuticorin lighters, sharp sterned and\r\ncopper bottomed, the largest boats in the fleet, ranging in capacity\r\nfrom twenty to forty tons each; and, most singular of all, the three\r\nmasted great canoes from Adirampatnam and Muttupat on the Tanjore coast,\r\npale blue in color and with curved prow. In addition to these standard\r\ntypes, added novelty is imparted by a few boats of design so odd and\r\nfantastic as would be conceived only by the mind of an oriental builder.\r\n\r\nReaching the camp at the beginning of the season, these boats are\r\nexamined by the officials as to condition and equipment and, if found\r\nsatisfactory, are registered and numbered. When the quantity of oysters\r\nto be removed is small, many more boats may arrive than is necessary or\r\nthan can find profitable employment. Formerly when this occurred a\r\nlottery was held to determine those to be employed. More recently the\r\nofficials have endeavored to engage all boats passing the inspection,\r\nalthough to do so might necessitate arranging the fleet into two\r\ndivisions, each fishing on alternate days. In 1874, the boats were\r\narranged in three divisions, the red, blue and green, with fifty boats\r\nin each; in 1879, and again in 1881, there were two divisions, the red\r\nand the blue; and likewise in 1880, in 1903 and in 1906 there were two,\r\nthe red and the white divisions. Of the 318 boats employed in the 1905\r\nfishery, 143 were from Kilakarai, seventy-four from Jaffna, thirty-five\r\nfrom Tuticorin, thirty-four from Paumben, nine from Manaar, six from\r\nNegapatam, five from Colombo, four each from Tondi and Kayalpatam, and\r\none each from Devipatam, Adrapatam, Ammopatam, and Koddaipatam.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons on each boat ranges from about twelve to\r\nsixty-five, with an average for the entire fleet of about thirty-five\r\nmen per boat. This includes the _sammatti_, or master, who represents\r\nthe owner; the _tindal_, or pilot; the _todai_, or water-bailer, who is\r\nvery necessary on these leaky craft, and who also takes charge of the\r\nfood and drinking water; at times a government inspector or “boat\r\nguard”; and from five to thirty divers, with an equal number of\r\n_manducks_, or attendants.[138] The _sammattis_, _tindals_, and _todais_\r\nare nearly all from the coast of southern India. The “boat guards” or\r\ninspectors are natives of Ceylon, and are employed by the government to\r\nprevent the fishermen from opening the oysters. Most of the _manducks_\r\nare from the Indian coast.\r\n\r\nOf the 4991 divers employed in 1905, 2649 were Moormen or Lubbais from\r\nKilakarai, Tondi, etc., on the Madura coast; 923 were Arabs; 424 were\r\nErukkalampiddi Moormen from Ceylon, and the remaining 995 were Tamils\r\nfrom Tuticorin, Rameswaram and elsewhere on the Madras coast, Malayalans\r\nfrom the Malabar coast, with small numbers from other localities on the\r\nAsiatic coasts.\r\n\r\nAmong the 8600 divers in 1906, were 4090 Arabs, the largest number of\r\nthose people employed in recent years. In 1905 there were only 923 Arab\r\ndivers, in 1904 only 238, and previously the number was much less. Some\r\nhave worked on the Ceylon coast since 1887, but most of them are newly\r\narrived from Bahrein and Kuweit, where they received their training as\r\npearl-divers. They are very energetic and skilful fishermen, far\r\nsurpassing the Tamils, coming early in the season and staying late, and\r\nworking on many days when rough seas deter the Indian divers from\r\nventuring out.\r\n\r\nThe Erukkalampiddi divers of Ceylon are by no means so energetic or\r\nsteady in work as the Arabs, and commonly desert the fishery before the\r\nclose. The Tamil divers belong to the Parawa and Kadeiyar castes.\r\n\r\nThe season in the Ceylon fishery is very short, only about six or eight\r\nweeks at the most; and the holidays and storms usually reduce the number\r\nof actual working days to less than thirty. In no other pearl fishery of\r\nimportance is the season less than four months in length, and in most of\r\nthem it extends through more than half of the year. Owing to this\r\nrestricted time, there is greater activity in the Ceylon fishery\r\ncompared with the value of the output than in any other pearl fishery in\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nAlthough the season is short, it is strenuous. Arising shortly after\r\nmidnight, the thousands of fishermen breakfast, perform their devotions\r\nand prepare to get under way so as to reach the reefs about sunrise.\r\nThere each boat takes its position on the ground allotted for the day’s\r\nwork, and which has been marked in advance by buoys topped with flags;\r\nand shortly afterward, on a signal from the guard vessel, the diving\r\ncommences. This is carried on in the same manner as already described\r\nfor the Persian Gulf, except that the Indian divers do not use\r\nnose-clips, only compressing the nostrils with the fingers during the\r\ndescent. Rarely do they descend to a greater depth than ten fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe divers work in pairs, each pair using a single diving stone in\r\ncommon, and descending alternately, precisely as in the Persian Gulf. It\r\nis remarkable what few changes have occurred in the methods of the\r\nfishery in the last six centuries; the description[139] of Marco Polo,\r\nwho visited the region about 1294, and of writers somewhat more recent,\r\nindicating that, in the main features, it was then conducted in the same\r\nmanner as at the present time.\r\n\r\nAn exception to the usual mode of diving is practised by the Malayalam\r\nfishermen, who, in some seasons—as in 1903, for instance—attend in large\r\nnumbers from Travancore and northward on the Malabar coast. These men\r\nare rather low in skill and physical endurance.[140] They dive head\r\nforemost from a spring-board, and even with this assistance,—or possibly\r\nwe should say, handicapped by this method,—they find the average depth\r\nof eight fathoms too great for them to work in with much comfort, rarely\r\nremaining under water longer than forty-five seconds.\r\n\r\nThe number of oysters secured on each visit to the bottom ranges from\r\nnothing to seventy-five or more, averaging between fifteen and fifty.\r\nThis depends not only on the ability of the fishermen, but also on the\r\nabundance of oysters and the ease with which they may be collected.\r\nSometimes they are held together in loose bunches of five to ten in\r\neach, and a diver can easily gather one hundred in the short length of\r\ntime he remains submerged. In other localities they may be somewhat\r\nfirmly attached individually to the bottom, so that some force is\r\nnecessary to release them, thus reducing the possible quantity.\r\nOrdinarily one dive clears a space of several square yards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Unloading oysters from the vessels into the kottus, at Marichchikadde,\r\n    Ceylon\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The pearling fleet on the shore at Marichchikadde, Ceylon\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Hindu workmen preparing to drill pearls, Marichchikadde, Ceylon\r\n]\r\n\r\nSince 1904, a steamer has been employed each season by the government\r\nfor dredging oysters in connection with experiments in oyster-culture.\r\nThe officer in charge of this work concludes that “dredging is\r\neconomically a more sound method of fishing than is diving.”[141] This\r\nview is disputed by the superintendent of the fishery, who points out\r\nthat the average catch by the steamer when dredging mature oysters only\r\nslightly exceeds that of an ordinary diving boat, and the cost of\r\nmaintenance and operation is vastly greater.[142] A remarkable tribute\r\nto the skill of the nude divers, brought out by this discussion, is\r\nthat, during some days when they were at work, the sea was too rough for\r\ndredging by the steamer, notwithstanding that she was a typical Grimsby\r\nor North Sea trawler of 150 tons measurement, built in 1896.[143]\r\n\r\nA rough comparison of the Ceylon method of catching pearl-oysters with\r\nthat practised by the American oyster-growers may not be uninteresting.\r\nOn a basis of 400 to the bushel, the total Ceylon catch of 81,580,716\r\npearl-oysters in 1905 represents a trifle more than 200,000 bushels, or\r\nabout the quantity annually produced by each of the half dozen leading\r\noyster-growers of this country. Each one of these growers requires only\r\nabout three steamers, at a total cost, maybe, of $25,000, and manned by\r\ntwenty-five men; instead of one steamer at a cost of $25,000 and 318\r\ndiving boats manned by 10,000 men, which was the equipment in Ceylon. To\r\nbe sure, the conditions under which the work is prosecuted are\r\ndifferent—however, not so entirely unlike as might be supposed—and the\r\nAmerican season is about six months long instead of the two months in\r\nCeylon; but the comparison is presented simply as a suggestion of the\r\npossibilities of dredging on the Ceylon reefs.\r\n\r\nUntil 1885, one of the most novel features of the fishery was the\r\nemployment of shark-charmers or “binders of sharks” (_kadal-kotti_ in\r\nthe Tamil language, _hai-banda_ in Hindustani), whose presence was\r\nrendered necessary by the superstition of the Indian divers. The\r\nfishermen placed implicit reliance upon the alleged supernatural powers\r\nof these impostors, resembling in some respects that reposed in the\r\n“medicine men” by the American Indians, and would not dive without their\r\nsupervision. It is unknown at what period the influence of these\r\nsemi-priests developed, but at the time of Marco Polo’s visit about\r\n1294, they were in the full bloom of their authority, receiving one\r\ntwentieth of the total catch of oysters,[144] which amounted to a very\r\nconsiderable sum. It is probable that the number of shark-charmers was\r\nthen quite large, some writers more recently referring to one for each\r\nboat. During the Portuguese occupation the number was reduced to twelve,\r\nand at the beginning of the British influence, it was further reduced to\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nInteresting descriptions have been given of the methods by which these\r\nmen exercised their alleged powers. In 1807, Cordiner stated:\r\n\r\n  One goes out regularly in the head pilot’s boat. The other performs\r\n  certain ceremonies on shore. He is stripped naked, and shut up in a\r\n  room, where no person sees him from the period of the sailing of the\r\n  boats until their return. He has before him a brass basin full of\r\n  water, containing one male and one female fish made of silver. If\r\n  any accident should happen from a shark at sea, it is believed that\r\n  one of these fishes is seen to bite the other. The divers likewise\r\n  believe that, if the conjurer should be dissatisfied, he has the\r\n  power of making the sharks attack them, on which account he is sure\r\n  of receiving liberal presents from all quarters.[145]\r\n\r\nAmusing stories are told of the shrewdness displayed by these fellows in\r\ninventing explanations to redeem their credit when a fisherman became a\r\nvictim of the sharks. These accounts are by men who evidently bore no\r\ngood-will toward the shark-charmers, and it would be of interest to hear\r\nfrom the other side; but we have been unable to find any one who has\r\nappeared in print in their defense.\r\n\r\nThe British government, in its policy of noninterference with the\r\nsuperstitions or semi-religious customs of the natives, tolerated these\r\nseeming impostors, owing, probably, in a measure, to the fact that the\r\nsuperstitious belief in their necessity was favorable to the\r\npreservation of the resources, since it restricted poaching on the\r\nreefs. However, the government endeavored to prevent an extravagant\r\nmisuse of the influence, and restricted the compensation of the\r\nshark-charmers to one oyster per day from each diver. Later, they were\r\nremunerated by the government, and were not allowed, under any pretense\r\nwhatever, to demand, exact, or receive oysters or any other compensation\r\nfrom the boatmen, divers, or any other persons. And, finally, in 1885,\r\nthe shark-charmers were done away with entirely, after having exacted\r\ntheir toll for upward of six centuries at least.\r\n\r\nThe dangers to which the Ceylon divers are exposed have been greatly\r\nexaggerated, and especially the risks from sharks. Poets tell how “the\r\nCeylon pearler went all naked to the hungry shark,” and the struggle of\r\nthe diver has been a favorite theme with sensational writers. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the trouble from this source is very slight, and the\r\noccupation is less dangerous than that of most of the deep-water\r\nfisheries, not to be compared, for instance, with that of the winter\r\nhaddock-fishery off the New England coast. Even in 1905, when 4991\r\ndivers and an equal number of assistants were employed in pearling, not\r\na single fatal accident was reported, and although much rough weather\r\nprevailed, not a fishing boat was lost. In the important fishery of\r\n1904, with 3049 divers, only one fatal accident occurred, this was an\r\nelderly Moorman, whose death at the bottom was apparently due either to\r\napoplexy or to exhaustion from remaining under water too long.\r\n\r\nThe superintendent of the fishery reported that not a single shark was\r\nseen during the 1904 season.[146] According to the statement of Sir\r\nWilliam Twynam, whose Ceylon pearl fishing experience and observation\r\nequal those of any European, he has never known of a diver being carried\r\noff by a shark, and has heard of only one case—“which was a very\r\ndoubtful one.”[147] Prof. James Hornell, the inspector of pearl banks,\r\nreported in 1904: “During all the months I have spent upon the pearl\r\nbanks during the last two years and a half I have never had a glimpse of\r\na shark dangerous to man. Several times the boatmen have caught basking\r\nsharks of considerable size, but all were of a species that lives almost\r\nentirely upon small crustaceans.”[148] The late Mr. A. M. Ferguson wrote\r\nin 1887: “I think it is pretty certain that in the whole course of the\r\nCeylon fisheries only two human beings have fallen victims to these\r\nfierce fishes.”[149]\r\n\r\nThe diving continues until a signal is given from the guard vessel about\r\ntwelve or one o’clock, this time depending largely on the beginning of\r\nthe sea breeze which roughens the water and interferes with the work,\r\nand likewise serves to speed the passage of the sail vessels to the\r\nshore. Occasionally the breeze is unfavorable, and the boatmen are\r\nobliged to row for miles, delaying their return in some instances until\r\nnightfall. Then the shore is lighted up to guide them to the landings,\r\nand extra precautions are maintained to prevent them from getting away\r\nwith some of the oysters in the darkness.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed—and doubtless with much truth—that it is not unusual for\r\nthe boatmen to take advantage of the time spent in reaching the shore to\r\nsurreptitiously open many of the oysters and extract the pearls\r\ntherefrom, throwing the refuse back into the sea. It would appear from\r\nsome authorities that this is a general practice. One official—and\r\nprobably the one in the best position to know—reported in 1905 that more\r\nthan 15,000,000 oysters, or nearly one fifth of the enormous catch\r\nduring that season, were illicitly opened.[150] However, this statement\r\nis strongly disputed by the superintendent of the fishery, who states:\r\n\r\n  As a matter of fact the opening of oysters that goes on in the boats\r\n  is of a much more casual description than this. The divers\r\n  occasionally pick out some of the best looking oysters that happen\r\n  to be conspicuous, or some that open, and look inside them. It is\r\n  quite possible that a valuable pearl might be found in this way, but\r\n  the chances are against it. It is hardly likely that the divers\r\n  would throw into the sea an enormous quantity of perfunctorily\r\n  examined oysters in which they have a share and which contain\r\n  pearls, while they were aware that immediately on landing they could\r\n  get good prices for their shares.[151]\r\n\r\nThe government officials have endeavored to put a stop to whatever\r\nlooting may exist, searching boats and occupants at the shore, revoking\r\nthe license of any boat showing evidence of oysters having been opened\r\nor carrying knives or other appliances for that purpose. The fishermen\r\nare alleged to resort to all sorts of devices to secrete their illicit\r\nfind of pearls, concealing them in the nose, ears, eyes, and other parts\r\nof the body, and even hiding them in parcels in the furled sails or\r\nattached to the embedded anchor. In some seasons—as in 1904 and 1905—the\r\ngovernment employed a guard for each boat. But serious criticism has\r\nbeen made of the integrity of these guards, who, with compensation of\r\nonly one rupee per diem, could scarcely be expected to resist the action\r\nof thirty or forty fishermen and report their doings, when by silence\r\nthey would have much to gain, and “the guards simply add to the number\r\nof thieves on board” was reported by one superintendent.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the most interesting sight in the Ceylon fishery is afforded\r\nby the return, about mid-afternoon, of the hundreds of novel,\r\nsail-spreading boats running before the wind and crowded with turbaned\r\nfishermen dressed in their few brilliant rags, and each anxious to be\r\nthe first at the wave-washed beach, where they are welcomed by an equal\r\nif not greater number of officials, merchants, laborers, and camp\r\nfollowers, gathered on the shore to learn the result of the fishery. The\r\nfantastic appearance of the boats, the diversified costumes of the\r\npeople, the general scene of animation, afford a view which for novelty\r\nis rarely equaled even in the picturesque Orient.\r\n\r\nThe average number of oysters brought in daily by each boat is about\r\n10,000. Some days when the weather is unfavorable many of the boats\r\nreturn empty; on other days they may have 25,000 or more. In 1905 the\r\nmaximum catch in one day for one boat was 29,990, while in 1904 a single\r\nboat brought in 37,675 oysters. The catch by the entire fleet one day in\r\n1905 was 4,978,686 oysters, or an average of 16,485 for each of the 302\r\nboats out on that occasion.\r\n\r\nEach person taking part in the fishery receives as his compensation a\r\ndefinite portion of the oysters. By government regulations, published in\r\n1855 and yet operative, each _sammatti_, _tindal_, and _todai_ receives\r\ndaily one dive of oysters from each diver in the boat to which they are\r\nrespectively attached. In some instances the hire of the boat is paid\r\nfor in cash—about Rs.1.50 per day from each diver,—but in most cases\r\neither one fifth or one sixth of each diver’s portion is devoted to this\r\npurpose. After these provisions have been made, each diver gives one\r\nthird of his remaining portion to his _manduck_, retaining the balance\r\nfor himself. The Moormen divers from Kilakarai commonly contribute one\r\ndive daily to the mosque of their native town,[152] in addition to the\r\nportions given to the _sammatti_, _tindal_, and _todai_. Previous to\r\n1855, the Hindu temples of the Madras Presidency were allowed to operate\r\na certain number of boats on their own account, but this led to so many\r\nabuses that it was abolished.\r\n\r\nAfter the boats are run up on the firm, hard beach, all the oysters are\r\nremoved by the crews of the boats into the government _koddu_ or\r\npalisade, a large wattle-walled and palm-thatched inclosure with square\r\npens, each bearing a number corresponding to that of each boat. This is\r\ndone under close supervision to prevent a diversion of the oysters from\r\nthe regular channels, which otherwise would be relatively easy among the\r\nanimation and excitement caused by the thousands of persons about the\r\nlanding-place.\r\n\r\nWithin the government inclosure, the oysters taken by each boat are\r\ndivided by the fishermen themselves into three portions as nearly equal\r\nas possible. This applies not only to the oysters falling to the share\r\nof the divers and _manducks_, but also to those set apart for the\r\n_sammatti_, _tindals_, and _todais_, for hire of the boat and even for\r\nthe Kilakarai mosque. An official indicates one of these as the share of\r\nthe fishermen, who at once remove their portion from the inclosure\r\nthrough a narrow gate on the landward side. By this arrangement a\r\nsatisfactory division of the oysters is secured and all cause for\r\ncomplaint or unfairness is removed. Previous to 1881, the fishermen\r\nreceived only one fourth of the catch as compensation for their work;\r\nbut in that year their portion was increased to one third, at which it\r\nhas since remained.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the fishermen pass out of the government _koddu_ with their\r\nquota, they are met by a crowd of natives eager to buy the oysters in\r\nsmall lots, and frequently at so many per rupee—ranging from eight to\r\ntwelve ordinarily. This “outside market” is one of the many interesting\r\nfeatures of the camp, for there are few persons on the shore who do not\r\nrisk small sums in testing their fortunes in this lottery. And a\r\nwonderful lottery it is too, in which a man may risk a few coppers and\r\nwin a prize worth hundreds of dollars. A poor Tamil once bought five\r\noysters for half a rupee, and in one of them he found the largest pearl\r\nof the season. Any not sold among this eager, animated throng are at\r\nonce marketed with a native buyer. The diver then hastens to immerse\r\nhimself in one of the bathing tanks provided for the purpose. It is\r\nclaimed that if this bath is omitted after immersion all the morning in\r\nthe salt water of the gulf, the diver is liable to fall ill; and a\r\nsufficient supply of fresh water for this purpose is an important factor\r\nin the arrangement of the camp.\r\n\r\nOwing to their sale in much smaller lots, or as we may say, at retail,\r\nthe fishermen succeed in getting relatively high prices for their\r\noysters, and their earnings exceed one half of the government’s share.\r\nIn 1905 this amounted to probably £86,000, or an average of about $1350\r\nfor each of the 318 boats. However, some crews made very much more than\r\nthis, with a corresponding decrease for the others. Although 1905 was a\r\nrecord year for large returns, even in an ordinary season pearl fishing\r\nis relatively profitable, as a skilled diver earns five or six times as\r\nmuch as a common laborer in Ceylon. The regulations particularly forbid\r\nthe employment of divers for a monetary consideration instead of for a\r\nshare of the oysters according to the established custom.\r\n\r\nThe remaining two thirds of the oysters in the _koddu_ are the property\r\nof the government. These are combined and counted. At nine o’clock each\r\nevening they are sold at auction, and by noon of the following day all\r\nhave been removed, and the inclosure is ready for the incoming catch.\r\n\r\nAt the auction the number of oysters to be sold that evening is\r\nannounced, and bids are invited. Some one starts the bidding at, maybe,\r\nRs.20 or 25, and this is advanced by successive bids until the limit\r\nappears to be reached, which may possibly be Rs.50 or 60. The successful\r\nbidder is permitted to take as many oysters in multiples of 1000 as he\r\nchooses; and after he is supplied, other merchants desiring them at that\r\nparticular price are accommodated. If there is no further demand for\r\nthem at that price, the bidding on the remaining oysters is begun\r\nprecisely as at first, and when the maximum bid is reached, all\r\nmerchants willing to give that amount are furnished with as many as they\r\nwish in multiples of 1000 as before. If this does not exhaust the\r\noysters, the bidding on the remainder is started up again, and so on\r\nuntil all are sold.[153] No one knows at the time whether he is buying a\r\nfortune in gems or only worthless shells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Indian pearl merchants ready for business\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Children of Persian pearl dealers\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe prices at which the oysters are sold at auction may differ greatly\r\nfrom the estimated valuation of the samples secured in the February\r\nexamination. For instance, in 1905 the valuation of the South Madaragam\r\noysters was Rs.17.86 per 1000, yet the auction sales on the first day\r\nbegan at Rs.53 and went up to Rs.61 per 1000, or three times the\r\nvaluation; and about the same general proportion of increase prevailed\r\nfor the oysters from the remaining banks, a result of great advances in\r\nthe market for pearls.\r\n\r\nThe auction prices for the different lots and from day to day are fairly\r\nconstant. But the shrewd Indian merchants know their business well and\r\nkeep in close touch with the yield, so that there are many variations in\r\nthe selling price that are puzzling to the uninitiated. A somewhat\r\nhigher estimation is placed on the oysters from certain banks, and also\r\non those from rocky portions of a particular reef, owing to their\r\nreputation for yielding a larger percentage of pearls. The estimation of\r\nparticular oysters varies to some extent according to the amount of\r\nadhering rock and coral growth. As already shown, the prices in 1906\r\ncovered the remarkable range of from Rs.20 to 309 per 1000.\r\nSuperstitious belief in luck also has its influence, and a buyer may\r\nconsider a certain day as unfavorable for him and abstain from bidding\r\non that occasion; or considering a particular day as lucky, he may bid\r\nvery high to secure a considerable portion of the sales.\r\n\r\nThe prices in different seasons vary greatly. In 1860, the average was\r\nRs.134.23 per 1000, which was unprecedentedly large; the nearest to this\r\nwas Rs.79.07 in 1874 and Rs.49 in 1905. In 1880, the average price per\r\n1000 was only Rs.11, which was the lowest ever recorded. The records for\r\nindividual days greatly exceed these limits. The highest figures at\r\nwhich oysters have sold on any one day was Rs.309 per 1000 in 1906, the\r\nequivalent for each oyster of 10½ cents in American money. In 1874, the\r\nprice reached Rs.210 per 1000, and in 1905, the maximum price was\r\nRs.124, or about 4¼ cents for each oyster.\r\n\r\nThe oyster-buyers are principally wealthy Chetties from Madura, Ramnad,\r\nTrichinopoli, Parambakudi, Tevakoddai, Paumben, Kumbhakonam, and other\r\ntowns of southern India. These are quite different from the scantily\r\nclothed Naddukoddai Chetties so common in Ceylon. Many of them are\r\nfashionably dressed in semi-European costume, with walking-stick, patent\r\nleather boots, and other evidences of contact with Europe. Smaller\r\nquantities of oysters are purchased by Moormen of Kilakarai, Ramnad,\r\nBombay, Adrampatam, Tondi, etc. A few oysters are also purchased by the\r\nNadans or Chánár caste people of Perunali, Kamuti, and Karakal. Over 99\r\nper cent. of the 50,346,601 oysters sold by the government in 1905 were\r\nsecured by Indian buyers, and less than one per cent. by Cingalese. A\r\nfew of the oysters—from two to five per cent.—are sent to Indian and\r\nCeylon ports, but most of them are opened at the fishing camp.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser of only a small number of oysters may open them at once by\r\nmeans of a knife, and with his fingers and eyes search for the pearls.\r\nBy this method very small pearls may be easily overlooked, and it is\r\nscarcely practicable in handling large quantities of oysters. These are\r\nremoved to private inclosures known as _toddis_ or _tottis_, situated\r\nsome distance from the inhabited portions of the camp; where, exposed to\r\nthe solar heat, they are permitted to putrefy, and the fleshy parts to\r\nbe eaten by the swarms of big red-eyed bluebottle flies, and the residue\r\nis then repeatedly washed.\r\n\r\nShakspere may have had in view some such scene as this when he spoke of\r\nthe “pearl in your foul oyster.” The lady who cherishes and adorns\r\nherself with a necklace of Ceylon pearls would be horrified were she to\r\nsee and especially to smell the putrid mass from which her lustrous gems\r\nare evolved. The great quantity of repulsive bluebottle flies are so\r\nessential to success in releasing the pearls from the flesh, that a\r\nscarcity of them is looked upon as a misfortune to the merchants.\r\nHowever, except it may be at the beginning of a fishery, there is rarely\r\never a cause for complaint on this score, for commonly they are so\r\nnumerous as to be a great plague to persons unaccustomed to them,\r\ncovering everything, and rendering eating and drinking a difficult and\r\nunpleasant necessity, until darkness puts a stop to their activities.\r\nBut the intolerable stench, impossible of description, the quintessence\r\nof millions of rotting oysters, fills the place, and makes existence a\r\nburden to those who have not acquired odor-proof nostrils. This animal\r\ndecomposition seems almost harmless to health; indeed, the natives\r\nevidently thrive on it, and eat and sleep without apparent notice of the\r\nnauseous conditions. And yet vegetable decomposition in this region is\r\nusually followed by fatal results. Notwithstanding sanitary precautions\r\nand the usual quarantine camp and hospitals, cholera occasionally\r\nbecomes epidemic and puts a stop to the fishery, as was the case in\r\n1889; but this probably was due more to the violation of ordinary\r\nsanitary laws than to the decaying oysters.\r\n\r\nIn a large _toddi_ the oysters are placed in a _ballam_, or a dug-out\r\ntank or trough, fifteen or twenty feet long and two or three feet deep,\r\nsmooth on the inside so that pearls may not lodge in the crevices. This\r\ntank is covered with matting, and the _toddi_ is closed up, sealed, and\r\nguarded for a week or ten days, when the fly maggots will have consumed\r\npractically all of the flesh tissues, leaving little else than the\r\nshells and pearls. The tank is then filled with sea water to float out\r\nthe myriads of maggots. Several nude coolies squat along the sides to\r\nwash and remove the shells. The valves of each shell are separated, the\r\noutsides rubbed together to remove all lodgments for pearls, and the\r\ninterior examined for attached or encysted pearls. The washers are kept\r\nunder constant supervision by inspectors to prevent concealment of\r\npearls; they are not permitted to remove their hands from the water\r\nexcept to take out the shells, and under no circumstances are they\r\nallowed to carry the hands to the mouth or to any other place in which\r\npearls could be concealed.\r\n\r\nAfter the shells have been removed, fresh supplies of water are added to\r\nwash the debris, which is turned over and over repeatedly, the dirty\r\nwater being bailed out through sieves to prevent the loss of pearls.\r\nAfter thorough washings, every particle of the _sarraku_, or material at\r\nthe bottom of the _ballam_, consisting of sand, broken pieces of shell,\r\npearls, etc., is gathered up in a cotton cloth. Later the _sarraku_ is\r\nspread out on cloths in the sun to dry, and the most conspicuous pearls\r\nare removed. When dry, the material is critically examined over and over\r\nagain, and winnowed and rewinnowed, and after it seems that everything\r\nof value has been secured, the refuse is turned over to women and\r\nchildren, whose keen eyes and deft fingers pick out many _masi-tul_ or\r\ndust-pearls; and even after the skill of these has been exhausted, the\r\napparently worthless refuse has a market value among persons whose\r\npatience and skill meets with some reward. It is due largely to the\r\nextreme care in the search that so many seed-pearls are found in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads to a discussion of what is commonly known in Ceylon as\r\nthe “Dixon washing machine.” This is an invention of Mr. G. G. Dixon who\r\nconstructed it at Marichchikadde in 1904 and 1905, at a total cost to\r\nthe government of about Rs.162,000,[154] including all expenses\r\nincidental to the experiment. The machine involves two separate\r\nprocesses; the first consists in separating the shells from the soft\r\nportion of the oysters, and the second in recovering the pearls from the\r\nresultant _sarraku_ after it has been dried. In 1905, about 5,000,000\r\noysters were put through this machine,[155] but with what result has not\r\nbeen announced.\r\n\r\nThe shells having pearls attached to the interior surface are turned\r\nover to skilled natives, who remove the valuable objects by breaking the\r\nshell with hammers, and then with files and other implements remove the\r\nirregular pieces of attached shell and otherwise improve the appearance.\r\n\r\nIn no fishery in the world is the average size of the pearls secured\r\nsmaller, nor is the relative number greater than in that of Ceylon. It\r\nis rare that one is found weighing over ten grains, and the number\r\nweighing less than two grains is remarkable. For roundness and orient\r\nthey are unsurpassed by those of any region. However, Ceylon pearls\r\nworth locally Rs.1000 ($400) are by no means abundant. The most valuable\r\none found in the important fishery of 1904, is said to have been sold in\r\nthe camp for Rs.2500. The fishery of 1905 yielded one weighing 76½\r\n_chevu_, and valued at Rs.12,000.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of seed-pearls obtained in the Ceylon fishery exceeds that\r\nof any other—probably all other parts of the world. The very\r\nsmallest—the _masi-tul_,—for which there is no use whatever in Europe,\r\nhave an established value in India, being powdered for making _chunam_\r\nfor chewing with betel. Those slightly larger,—_tul_ pearls—for which\r\nalso there is no market in Europe, are placed in the mouth of deceased\r\nHindus of wealth, instead of the rice which is used by poorer people.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the Ceylon pearls are silvery white in color, but\r\noccasionally yellowish, pinkish, and even “black” pearls are found,\r\nalthough the so-called “black” pearls are really brown or slate-colored.\r\nIn some seasons these are relatively numerous, as in 1887, for instance.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the large product at the fishery camp, it is difficult\r\nto purchase single pearls or small quantities there at a reasonable\r\nprice, the merchants objecting to breaking a _mudichchu_, or the lot\r\nresulting from washing a definite number of oysters.\r\n\r\nThe shells obtained in the Ceylon fisheries do not possess sufficient\r\nthickness of lustrous nacre for use as mother-of-pearl, and are mostly\r\nused for camp-filling. A few are burned and converted into _chunam_,\r\n_i.e._: prepared lime for building purposes, or to be used by natives\r\nfor chewing with the betel-nut. Forty or fifty years ago, before the\r\nlarge receipts of mother-of-pearl from Australia and the southern\r\nPacific, there was a good market for the shell for button manufacture\r\nand the like, but since 1875 only the choicest have been used for this\r\npurpose, and these are worth only about $25 per ton delivered in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that up to the close of the season of 1906, the\r\nCeylon fisheries were operated by the colonial government as a state\r\nmonopoly. In 1904, proposals were made to the British colonial office by\r\na London syndicate with a view to leasing the fisheries for a term of\r\nyears. The original suggestion was that they should be leased for thirty\r\nyears in consideration of an annual rental of £13,000 or Rs.195,000,\r\ntogether with a share of the net profits after payment of a reasonable\r\nrate of interest on the investment; and later it was suggested that the\r\nrental be Rs.100,000 a year and twenty per cent. of the profits after\r\nseven per cent. on capital had been paid to the shareholders. But the\r\ngovernment preferred a definite money payment without any rights to\r\nshare in the profits realized; and after lengthy negotiations this was\r\nfixed at Rs.310,000 annually, with certain preliminary payments.\r\nAccordingly, on November 30, 1905, a preliminary agreement was executed\r\nbetween the crown agents for the colonies, acting on behalf of the\r\ngovernment of Ceylon, and representatives of the Ceylon Company of Pearl\r\nFishers, Limited. On February 27, 1906, this agreement was confirmed and\r\nmade effective by special ordinance[156] of the governor and legislative\r\ncouncil of Ceylon, and the crown agents were authorized to execute the\r\nlease as of January 1, 1906.\r\n\r\nThe principal financial terms of this lease required the company to\r\npurchase the expensive Dixon pearl-washing machine at a cost of\r\nRs.120,000, which was Rs.42,000 less than it cost the government during\r\nthe preceding two years; to purchase at a cost of Rs.62,501 the\r\nsteamship _Violet_, which the government had used in its experimental\r\noyster-culture; to reimburse the government each year the amount spent\r\nin policing, sanitation and hospital services at the fishery camp, which\r\nhad in some individual seasons amounted to more than Rs.200,000; to\r\nexpend each year from Rs.50,000 to Rs.150,000 in the development of\r\npearl-oyster culture; and to pay an annual rental of Rs.315,000, a rate\r\nbased roughly on the average return of the preceding twenty years,\r\nincluding the record year of 1905.\r\n\r\nThe company was authorized to take up the pearl-oysters by means of\r\ndivers, or by steam dredges, or by such other mechanical means as might\r\nappear most advantageous, and to carry on such experiments with the\r\nimmature oysters as appeared most conducive to the profitable working of\r\nthe fisheries, provided they do nothing to make the resources less\r\nvaluable at the expiration of the lease.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting features of the lease is that relating to\r\nthe power of the colonial government to grant an exclusive right of\r\nfishing on the banks outside the three-mile limit. The question of this\r\nexclusive right arose in 1890, but was not conclusively determined.\r\nFearing lest this authority did not exist, the terms in which the right\r\nof fishing was conveyed were carefully chosen by the attorney general to\r\nprotect the government from liability “should any international question\r\narise”;[157] and the government leased to the company “all the right or\r\nprivilege which the lessors have hereto exercised and enjoyed of fishing\r\nfor and taking pearl-oysters on the coasts of Ceylon between Talaimannar\r\nand Dutch Bay Point, to the intent that the company _so far as the\r\nlessors can secure the same_ may have the exclusive right, liberty and\r\nauthority to fish for, take and carry away pearl-oysters within the said\r\nlimits.... But nothing in this lease shall be taken to make the lessors\r\nanswerable in damages if _owing to any cause beyond the control of the\r\nlessors_ the company is prevented from fully exercising and enjoying\r\nsuch exclusive right and privilege.”[158]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while the negotiations were in progress, there occurred\r\nthe very profitable fishery of 1905, from which the colonial government\r\nderived a revenue of Rs.2,510,727, or approximately eight times the\r\nproposed annual rental; and before the lease was finally concluded\r\noccurred the fishery of 1906, with its revenue of Rs.1,376,746. While it\r\nis true that a succession of barren seasons prevailed from 1892 to 1902,\r\nyet, as the revenue in 1903 was Rs.829,548, and in 1904 it was\r\nRs.1,065,751, there was, in the four years ending in 1906, a revenue to\r\nthe government of Rs.5,782,772, or nearly as much as the total amount to\r\nbe derived from the lease during the twenty years it was to run. These\r\nfigures seemed to furnish strong reasons for retaining such a valuable\r\nsource of revenue, with its possibilities of still greater expansion\r\nunder the supervision and direction of specialists in the employ of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMany of the inhabitants of Ceylon saw in this a decided objection to the\r\nlease, and there was a general feeling of indignation in the colony,\r\nwith public meetings in protest, and the like. In reply to a memorial\r\nprepared at one of these meetings held in Colombo, Lord Elgin, the\r\nBritish secretary of state for the colonies, wrote under date of May 9,\r\n1906:\r\n\r\n  The memorialists have protested against the lease on the double\r\n  ground that a lease on any terms is contrary to the best interests\r\n  of Ceylon, and that the rent agreed upon is “under existing\r\n  circumstances wholly inadequate.” There must always be in cases of\r\n  this kind a difference of opinion as to whether a fixed annual sum,\r\n  with immunity from all expense and sundry other advantages, is or is\r\n  not preferable to continuing to face all the risks for the sake of\r\n  all the profits. In the present instance the lease appears to me to\r\n  have been drafted with a sincere desire to safeguard to the utmost\r\n  the property and interests of the Colony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Street scene in Marichchikadde, the pearling camp of Ceylon\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Return of the fleet from the pearl reefs to Marichchikadde, Ceylon\r\n]\r\n\r\n  It may be true that the development of the fishery upon a scientific\r\n  system affords good prospect of a greater return in the future than\r\n  has been obtained in the past, and affords at least the hope that\r\n  the barren cycles which have been so common in the past will not\r\n  recur to the same extent. But the operations necessary to that end\r\n  are of a highly technical and experimental character, and I am very\r\n  doubtful whether any machinery which could be set in motion by the\r\n  Government would be suited to develop processes at once so doubtful\r\n  and so delicate. In twenty years’ time the Colonial Government will\r\n  receive back the fishery, not only intact, but in the most perfect\r\n  state to which commercial enterprise and scientific methods can\r\n  raise it, and, in the meanwhile, a regular and substantial payment\r\n  is assured. Twenty years are no doubt a considerable period in the\r\n  lifetime of individuals; but if within that time all the resources\r\n  that science can contribute toward systematic development of the\r\n  fisheries have been applied and thoroughly tested, the period will\r\n  not, I think, be regarded as excessive or unfortunate in the history\r\n  of a fishery which has lasted for more than two thousand years.[159]\r\n\r\nThe Ceylon Company of Pearl Fishers, Limited, with a paid up capital of\r\n£165,000, has just entered into possession of its lease, and it is\r\nuncertain what changes will be made in the methods of the fishery or\r\nwhat measure of success will follow the attempts at pearl-oyster culture\r\nand the growth of pearls. The attention of the pearling interests of the\r\nworld is now directed to the work of this company in the development of\r\nits magnificent leasehold, and it seems not unlikely that greater\r\nchanges will be made in the methods of the industry during the ensuing\r\ndecade than have occurred in the whole of the last ten centuries.[160]\r\n\r\nA curious fishery, with the _Placuna placenta_ for its object, exists in\r\nTablegram Lake, a small bay in northeastern Ceylon adjacent to the\r\nmagnificent harbor of Trincomali, which Nelson declared to be “the\r\nfinest in the world.” At intervals during the nineteenth century, the\r\nCeylon government leased the Tablegram Lake fishery to native bidders\r\nfor a period of three consecutive years. In 1857, Dr. Kelaart visited\r\nthe place and calculated that in the three years preceding, eighteen\r\nmillion oysters had been removed.[161] Owing to scarcity of the mollusk,\r\nno fisheries have existed since 1890, but from 1882 to 1890 they were\r\nregularly leased at an average of Rs.5000 for each term of three years.\r\nProf. James Hornell, who made a careful examination in 1905, reported\r\nthat if the business were carried on providently and systematically, “it\r\nshould become the source of a fairly regular annual revenue to\r\nGovernment of from Rs.10,000 to Rs.12,000, possibly even more.”[162]\r\n\r\nThe _Placuna_ oysters are caught by Moormen divers, who are scarcely\r\nequal physically to the pearl fishery in the sea. They rarely descend\r\nmore than four fathoms, and most of the work in Tablegram Bay is in less\r\nthan two fathoms. Each diver returns with from one to five or more\r\noysters, depending on their abundance, and receives one half of the\r\ncatch as his share of the proceeds. Unlike the method in the\r\npearl-oyster fishery of Ceylon, the _Placuna_ oysters are opened while\r\nfresh, this work being performed by coolies, who are compensated at the\r\nrate of about Rs.3 per 1000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE PEARL FISHERIES OF INDIA\r\n\r\n            There are two moments in a diver’s life:\r\n            One, when a beggar, he prepares to plunge;\r\n            Then, when a prince, he rises with his prize.\r\n\r\n                                            ROBERT BROWNING.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the great fame of the pearl fisheries of India, those\r\nprosecuted within the limits of British India proper are of small\r\nextent. The only pearl resources within the empire are the rarely\r\nproductive reefs on the Madras coast in the vicinity of Tuticorin, the\r\nrelatively modern fisheries of Mergui Archipelago, and some small reefs\r\nof only local importance on the Malabar coast and in the Bombay\r\npresidency.\r\n\r\nThe celebrity of India in connection with the pearl fisheries has never\r\nrested on the extent of those within the territorial limits or under the\r\ncontrol of this government. It originated in the fact that it is largely\r\nIndian capital which finances the fisheries of Ceylon and of the Persian\r\nGulf; nearly all of the divers and others employed in Ceylon are from\r\nthe coast of this empire, and most of the pearls are purchased by\r\nmerchants of Bombay, Madura, Trichinopoli, and other large towns. Thus,\r\nfrom an economic and industrial point of view, the pearl fisheries of\r\nCeylon, and to a less extent those of the Persian Gulf, have contributed\r\nto the fame and to the wealth of the Empire of India.\r\n\r\nThe pearl fisheries off Tuticorin in the Madras presidency have been\r\nreferred to incidentally in the account of the fisheries of Ceylon. They\r\nare separated by only a few miles of water, and are prosecuted by the\r\nsame fishermen and in precisely the same manner. Consequently, it is\r\ndifficult to discuss them separately, especially in their early history\r\nand during the time that this part of the world was under the rule of\r\nthe Portuguese and later of the Dutch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The pearling regions in Ceylon and British India\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fisheries of the Madras coast compete in antiquity with those of\r\nCeylon. Indeed, from the time of Ptolemy to the seventeenth century, the\r\nindustry seems to have been prosecuted largely from the Madras side of\r\nthe gulf, centering at Chayl or Coil on the sandy promontory of Ramnad.\r\nThis place appears to be the Κόλχοι of Ptolemy, the Ramana Koil of the\r\nnatives, as well as the Cael of the travelers of the Middle Ages. But\r\nduring the last three hundred years, the Ceylon side has been the scene\r\nof the greatest pearling operations; and from the Madras coast, the\r\nfisheries have not been prosecuted except at long intervals, averaging\r\nonce in fifteen or twenty years.\r\n\r\nOwing to the scarcity of oysters and to other causes, the fishery was\r\nprosecuted on the Madras coast in only eight years of the whole period\r\nfrom 1768 to 1907. These years of productivity were 1822, 1830, 1860,\r\n1861, 1882, 1889, 1890, and 1900; and even then the yield was relatively\r\nsmall. The largest was 15,874,500 oysters in 1860, from which the Madras\r\ngovernment derived a revenue of Rs.250,276; and about half as many\r\noysters were obtained in 1861 with a revenue of Rs.129,003. Numerous and\r\nprolonged experiments in conserving the reefs and in cultivating the\r\noysters have been made without success. The reason usually given for the\r\ngreater wealth of oysters on the Ceylon side is, that it is more\r\nsheltered from the strong currents which sweep down the Bay of Bengal\r\ninto the Gulf of Manaar and impinge directly on the coast of the\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the fishery are at Tuticorin, near to Madura, the\r\nBenares of the south, the holy “City of Sweetness” which the gods have\r\ndelighted to honor from time immemorial. But the camp is commonly\r\nerected of palmyra and bamboo on the barren shore several miles distant\r\nfrom Tuticorin. The 1890 fishery was at Salápatturai, and that of 1900\r\nat a place which received the mouth-filling name of Veerapandianpatanam.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for pearling at Tuticorin are similar to those on the\r\nCeylon coast. In the autumn the reefs are examined by government\r\ninspectors, and if the conditions seem to warrant a fishery in the\r\nfollowing spring, arrangements are made therefor and the proper\r\nnotification issued. The announcement follows the general plan of that\r\nin Ceylon. The following, from the Fort St. George “Gazette,” Madras,\r\nJanuary 16, 1900, is a copy of the notification preceding the last\r\nfishery which has occurred:\r\n\r\n  Notice is hereby given that a pearl fishery will take place at\r\n  Veerapandianpatanam on or about the 12th March, 1900.\r\n\r\n  1. The bank to be fished is the Theradipulipudithapar, estimated to\r\n  employ 100 boats for twenty days with average loads of 7,000 oysters\r\n  per day.\r\n\r\n  2. It is therefore recommended that such boat owners and divers as\r\n  may wish to be employed shall be at Tuticorin on or before the 1st\r\n  of March next and anchor their boats abreast of the government\r\n  flagstaff; the first day’s fishing will take place on the 12th of\r\n  March, weather permitting.\r\n\r\n  3. The fishery will be conducted on account of Government, and the\r\n  oysters put up for sale in such lots as may be deemed expedient.\r\n\r\n  4. The arrangements of the fishery will be the same as have been\r\n  usual on similar occasions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PEARLS PRESENTED BY THE IMAM OF MUSCAT TO PRESIDENT VAN BUREN\r\n\r\n  Now in the United States National Museum, Washington, D. C.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  5. Payments to be made in ready money in rupees or in Government of\r\n  India notes. Checks on the Bank of Madras or Bank Agencies will be\r\n  received on letters of credit being produced to warrant the drawing\r\n  of such checks.\r\n\r\n  6. All particulars can be obtained on application to the\r\n  Superintendent of Pearl Fisheries, Tuticorin.\r\n\r\n                                              Sd/—J. P. BEDFORD,\r\n                                                          _Collector_.\r\n\r\n  Tinnevelly Collector’s Office,\r\n    16th November 1899.\r\n\r\nOn the long sweep of desolate shore at a place convenient to the reefs,\r\na temporary camp is erected, just as is done on the Ceylon coast.\r\nHowever, this camp is not nearly so large, only about one fourth or one\r\nfifth the size of that on the eastern side of the gulf. It resembles the\r\nlarger one in the quarters for divers and merchants, the bazaars, the\r\nbungalows for the officials, the hospital, the sale and washing\r\ninclosures, etc.; in addition to these is the temporary Roman Catholic\r\nchapel.\r\n\r\nThe divers are mainly of the Parawa caste from Tuticorin, Pinnacoil,\r\nPamban, etc. on the Madras coast. Although influenced by many Hindu\r\nsuperstitions, they are nominally Roman Catholics, as evidenced by the\r\nscapulars suspended from the neck, their ancestors having been converted\r\nand baptized through the zealous work of that prince of missionaries,\r\nSt. Francis Xavier, in the sixteenth century. Even yet a chapel at\r\nPinnacoil is held in special reverence by these people as a place where\r\nthe saintly father preached. Professor Hornell writes that the present\r\nhereditary head of this caste is Don Gabriel de Croos Lazarus Motha Vaz,\r\nknown officially as the Jati Talaiva More, or Jati Talaivan. He resides\r\nat Tuticorin, and is largely the intermediary between the government and\r\nthe Parawa fishermen.\r\n\r\nIn the details of its prosecution, the Madras fishery differs in no\r\nimportant particular from that of Ceylon. The boats are manned and\r\noperated in precisely the same way; they fish in the morning only,\r\ntaking advantage of the prevailing favorable winds; the divers carry the\r\noysters into the government inclosure, and divide them into three equal\r\nlots, of which they receive one; the share of the government is\r\nauctioned daily, the divers disposing of theirs as they choose; and the\r\noysters are rotted and washed in the same manner as in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fishery for pearl-oysters at Tuticorin, two other\r\nspecies of pearl-producing mollusks are collected in the Madras\r\npresidency; one of these is a species of mussel (_Mytilus smaragdinus_,\r\naccording to Dr. Edgar Thurston of the Madras Museum), which is\r\ncollected from the estuary of the Sonnapore River near Berhampore; and\r\nthe other is the _Placuna placenta_, found in many places in this\r\npresidency, and especially in Pulicat Lake and in the vicinity of\r\nTuticorin.\r\n\r\nThe Sonnapore mussels, which are small and bright green in color, are\r\nfound adhering to the masses of edible oysters in depths of ten or\r\ntwelve feet of water. They are caught in a novel manner, as described in\r\na letter from the acting collector of customs at Ganjam. Thrusting a\r\nlong bamboo pole deep into the bottom of the reef, the fisherman dives\r\ndown, and holding on to this bamboo, breaks off as large a mass of the\r\noysters as he can bring to the surface in one hand, helping himself up\r\nthe bamboo pole with the other. Removing the mussels from the mass, he\r\nopens them with a suitable knife and by running his thumbs and fingers\r\nover the flesh tissues, detects the pearls therein. These pearls are of\r\nvery inferior quality and of little ornamental value. They are sold\r\nmostly for chunám and for placing in the mouth of deceased Hindus.\r\n\r\nAlong the west coast of India, in the Bombay presidency, a few pearls\r\nare found at various places, but the output is of slight value. The most\r\nimportant of these is off the coast of Nawanagar, on the south side of\r\nthe Gulf of Cutch, where the true pearl-oyster is found.\r\n\r\nAccording to the “Jamnagar Diwan,” the yearly value of the Nawanagar\r\nfisheries is about Rs.4000. This is smaller than formerly, as the reefs\r\nare in a depleted state; to give them a chance to recuperate, a close\r\nseason was established in 1905. The oysters are found along a coast-line\r\neighty miles in length extending from Mangra, near Jodya Bunder, to\r\nPindera in the Gulf of Cutch, and also about the islands of Ajad, Chauk,\r\nKalumbar, and Nora, which are also situated in the Cutch Gulf. They are\r\nnot procured by diving, but are gathered off the rocks when the tide is\r\nout. During the monsoon, the collection is limited to eight days in the\r\nmonth; _i.e._, from the twelfth to the fifteenth of each half according\r\nto the Hindu calendar.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries are by law restricted exclusively to the _waghers_ of ten\r\nvillages, which are Varinar, Sashana, Sika, Balachedi, Jhakher, Sarmat,\r\nBharana, Salaya, Chudesar, and Bedi. The collection of the pearls is\r\nleft entirely to these men, who at Divala—the Hindu new year—bring all\r\nthe pearls gathered by them to the durbar. There an estimate is made of\r\ntheir value, one fourth of which is paid to the _waghers_, and the\r\npearls are turned over to the representatives of the state treasury for\r\nsale. This method of conducting the industry has been long established.\r\nIn recent years the government experimented in farming out the revenue,\r\nbut the old custom has been resumed in order to placate the native\r\nfishermen.\r\n\r\nA few pearl-oysters are also found on the Ratnagiri coast below Bombay,\r\nand likewise at Kananur in the Malabar district. In 1901–1902, there was\r\nsome local excitement about pearls found at Belapur and quantities were\r\nreported as collected; but since then little has been heard of the\r\nindustry in that region.\r\n\r\nElsewhere on the west coast of India, pearls are obtained from the\r\nso-called “window-glass” shell, of the genus _Placuna_. The individual\r\nshells are flat, thin, and transparent, and are still used in Goa and\r\nvicinity as a substitute for glass in windows. This mollusk is abundant\r\nfrom Karachi, near the Baluchistan border, to the Kanara district south\r\nof Bombay; and wherever it occurs in any abundance it is collected for\r\nthe sake of the small pearls found therein.\r\n\r\nOf the fishery at Karachi, Mr. E. H. Aitken writes: “It is farmed out by\r\nGovernment for a good sum. In 1901, the amount realized was Rs.3650 for\r\na period of three years; but the lessee lost heavily, and in 1904 the\r\nhighest offer for a similar period of three years was Rs.1851. Pearls\r\nmay be found in as many as ten to twenty per cent. of the mature\r\nmollusks.” Pearls are far more numerous in the _Placuna_ than in the\r\npearl-oysters, but few of them are of sufficient size or luster to be\r\nused as ornaments, ranking with the so-called medicinal pearls of\r\nEurope. They are much softer in texture than the pearls of the\r\nMargaritiferæ. The largest are commonly of irregular form, with the\r\nsurface slightly botryoidal or like the “strawberry” pearls of the\r\nMississippi. While not often used as ornaments, they are highly valued\r\nby the Hindus in calcined or powdered form for medicinal purposes, and\r\nespecially to be chewed with the betel-nut, and are also used in the\r\noriginal form in funeral rites, a small quantity being placed in the\r\nmouth of a deceased person.\r\n\r\nIn the Mergui Archipelago, which is within the territory of lower Burma\r\nand under the jurisdiction of the government of British India, patches\r\nof pearl-oyster reefs are scattered over an area roughly computed at\r\n11,000 square miles, taking 97° 40′ as the western boundary. They occur\r\nprincipally in the strong tidal passages among the islands. The bottom\r\nis formed largely of porphyritic granite interspersed with sand and\r\nthinly covered with corals, coral cups, the long whip-like black coral\r\n(_Antipathes arborea_), and other submarine animal and vegetable\r\ngrowths.[163] These constitute a home most favorable to the growth and\r\ndevelopment of molluscan life.\r\n\r\nOf the several species of pearl-bearing mollusks occurring in the Mergui\r\nArchipelago, by far the most important is the “mok,” or large Australian\r\npearl-oyster (_Margaritifera maxima_). The shell attains a maximum size\r\nof about thirteen inches in diameter, and the nacre is of a milky or\r\nsilvery color. This species occurs in its two varieties of “golden lip”\r\nand “silver edge,” the former being in greater abundance. The “silver\r\nedge” shell is the more valuable owing to its uniformity of coloring,\r\nand the pearls found therein are of superior luster and orient.\r\n\r\nThe “pate goung,” or Lingah pearl-oyster (_Margaritifera vulgaris_), is\r\nsimilar to that of the Gulf of Manaar. It is circular in shape and\r\nmeasures about two and one half inches in diameter. The nacre is\r\nsilvery, with slight yellowish tinge. Many of the pearls from this\r\nspecies are of a silvery color, but most of them are yellowish or\r\ngolden. The fishery for this mollusk is of little importance compared\r\nwith that for the larger pearl-oyster, which is the species referred to\r\nin Mergui when not otherwise mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe pearl fisheries of Mergui originated with the Selangs or Salangs, a\r\nnomadic race of maritime gipsies, the last remnants of whom live among\r\nthe three thousand islands of this group. They are supposed to be of\r\nMalay descent; but their early history is unknown, and they are rapidly\r\npassing away in the conflict of existence with the neighboring peoples.\r\nProbably in no part of the world are the pearl fisheries prosecuted by a\r\nmore primitive class of men. With their women and children, they live\r\nmainly in roomy dug-out boats; but during the southwest monsoon they\r\nerect temporary shelters on the shore, these consisting of a few frail\r\nsticks, supporting coverings of braided mats, and floors of bamboo\r\nstrips.\r\n\r\nThey have few wants and derive a livelihood principally from gathering\r\nand bartering shells, pearls, cured _thadecon_, and nests of the\r\nsea-swallow (Collocalia). Within depths of six or eight fathoms they are\r\nfairly good divers, both the men and the women, but their physical\r\nendurance is slight. Their trade is mostly with Chinese merchants who\r\nvisit them in small vessels. No information exists as to when the\r\nSelangs first found profit in searching for pearls; but it was probably\r\nmany centuries ago, and for a long time they made contributions of them\r\nto the Buddhist rulers of Burma.\r\n\r\nShortly after the acquisition of Mergui Archipelago in 1826,\r\nrepresentatives of the British government brought experienced divers\r\nfrom southern India to examine more fully the resources which the\r\nSelangs had made known; but as only seed-pearls were secured, the\r\ngovernment concluded that they would yield an insignificant revenue, and\r\nthe attempt to develop these resources was given up.[164]\r\n\r\nHowever, the Selangs continued to fish in their primitive fashion; and\r\nas the market for the shell developed, the profits increased. But their\r\nwants were easily appeased, and the increased profits were\r\ncounterbalanced by decreased activities. Old traders among the islands\r\ntell of the opportunities of those days when choice pearls could be\r\nobtained for a pinch of opium or for a few ounces of tobacco.\r\n\r\nFar from the highways of the world, the Selangs remained undisturbed in\r\ntheir beautiful seas until nearly twenty years ago. Meanwhile, 800 miles\r\ndistant, Singapore had arisen from a desert shore to the rank of a great\r\nseaport, and the headquarters for the pearl fishery of the Malay\r\nArchipelago and of the northwestern coast of Australia. In this fishery\r\nthe vessels were well equipped and depended on the use of diving\r\napparatus rather than on nude divers.\r\n\r\nBeginning about 1888, some of these vessels made occasional visits to\r\nthe Mergui pearl-oyster reefs, and usually with very profitable results.\r\nThis was the first instance in which diving apparatus was successfully\r\nintroduced on any part of the Asiatic coast from the Red Sea to Malacca\r\nStrait. So great was the profit that nearly every one on the lower coast\r\nof Burma with sufficient capital or credit hastened to obtain a boat and\r\ndiving equipment. The success of some of these early ventures was\r\nremarkable, single pearls worth $3000, $5000, and even $10,000 each\r\nbeing secured. The reefs in the shoal waters were rapidly depleted, to\r\nthe great disadvantage of the nude Selangs, who can do little in deep\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWith a view to deriving a revenue from these well-equipped vessels, the\r\ngovernment of Burma in 1898 divided the 11,000 square miles of pearling\r\nterritory into five definite areas known as “blocks.” The area within\r\neach of these blocks was surveyed, marked, and charted; and the\r\nfinancial commissioner from time to time determined as to each block\r\nwhether licenses for pearl fishing should be issued, or whether the\r\nexclusive right therein should be leased. These leases were disposed of\r\neither by inviting tenders and granting the lease to any of the persons\r\nwho might tender, or by public auction, as the financial commissioner\r\nmight direct. By the terms of the lease, the lessee was obliged to\r\nregister at the office of the deputy commissioner of finance the number\r\nof boats and pumps employed by him; to declare by letter, at the end of\r\neach month, the number, weight, and estimated value of all\r\nmother-of-pearl shell and pearls collected during the month, and to\r\nrefrain from taking any mother-of-pearl measuring less than six inches\r\nfrom lip to hinge.\r\n\r\nOutside the limits of blocks in which the exclusive pearl fishing was\r\nleased, licenses to use diving implements were granted in such number\r\nand on payment of such fees, not exceeding Rs.1000 per apparatus, as\r\nmight from time to time be fixed, every such license expiring on June 30\r\nnext following the date on which it was granted, and no license was\r\ntransferable.\r\n\r\nThe five blocks in which the Mergui pearling rights were leased are of\r\nlarge area, averaging somewhat over 2000 square miles each. The lessees\r\ncustomarily granted permits to subsidiary fishermen to operate in their\r\nrespective blocks, on payment of a royalty, this ranging in amount from\r\n12½ to 25 per cent. of the mother-of-pearl secured, and the pearls found\r\nwere the absolute property of the fishermen.\r\n\r\nUntil 1900 the pearling rights were leased by blocks as above noted.\r\nRights to catch trochus, green snail shells, and sea-slugs, were\r\nincluded in the lease. It was noticed that European pearlers always\r\nsublet the trochus and green snail rights, and it was decided to auction\r\nthese separately; while as regards pearling proper the auction system\r\nwas abolished in that year in favor of a system of licensing individual\r\nvessels for a fee of Rs.400 each. The right to collect pearls by nude\r\ndiving was thought for some time to have been left free; but\r\nsubsequently it was auctioned along with the rights to collect green\r\nsnails, trochus and sea-slugs.\r\n\r\nThe following summary, compiled from data furnished by Mr. I. H. Burkill\r\nof the Indian Civil Service, shows the extent of the pearl and shell\r\nfisheries of Mergui for a series of years.\r\n\r\n Year.

The season extends from\r\nOctober to April or May, when the southwest monsoon begins and puts a\r\nstop to the fishery on this exposed coast.\r\n\r\nThe boats used are mostly of Burmese build. They measure from 25 to 35\r\nfeet in length, and 7 or 8 feet in width, and have 18 to 24 inches of\r\ndraft, with curved or half-moon shaped keels, and with high square\r\nsterns. Owing to the very light draft and the amount of free-board, they\r\nare deficient in weatherly qualities; but are fast sailors before the\r\nwind and are easily rowed from place to place. For this reason they are\r\nespecially suited to the industry in Mergui, because during the pearling\r\nseason calms and light winds prevail and oars form the principal motive\r\npower, especially in the channels and passageways between the islands\r\nwhere the tides are frequently very swift.\r\n\r\nIf a number of boats are of the same ownership, a schooner of thirty to\r\none hundred tons’ capacity is commonly provided as a floating station\r\nand base of supplies for them; the gathering of such a fleet presents an\r\ninteresting sight, like a great white hen among her brood of chickens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FROM THE TREASURY OF THE EMIR OF BOKHARA\r\n\r\n  Necklace and earrings. Property of an American lady\r\n]\r\n\r\nMost of the boats are from Mergui, and are chartered at a monthly rate\r\nof from Rs.105 to Rs.120 each, including a crew of four or five Burmans\r\nwith their subsistence, consisting principally of rice and salted fish;\r\nthe charterer is further required to pay each member of the crew four\r\nannas, or one rupee, for each day actually employed in operating the\r\ndiving pump. In addition to these men, each boat carries one diver and\r\nan attendant, commonly known as “tender.” The boat is sailed or rowed by\r\nthe crew, as directed by the diver; and while the latter is submerged,\r\nthe boat and crew are under the supervision of the attendant.\r\n\r\nThe divers are the most important men in the fleet, for on their ability\r\nand efficiency depends the success of the enterprise. A very\r\nconsiderable portion of them are natives of the Philippine Islands,\r\nalthough many Japanese have been employed recently, and the number is\r\nincreasing. The compensation is at the rate of £2 to £4 per month, and\r\n£20 for each ton of mother-of-pearl secured. The attendants are likewise\r\nmostly Manilamen, but many Malayans and Burmans are employed; the wages\r\nrange from Rs.50 to Rs.80 per month, including provisions. The peculiar\r\nduties of the attendant are to help the diver into his dress, place the\r\nshoulder leads into position, screw on the helmet, and especially to\r\nreceive and respond to signals and to direct the movements of the vessel\r\nin accordance therewith.\r\n\r\nThe scaphander, or diving dress, is composed of solid sheet rubber,\r\ncovered on both sides with canvas. The head-piece is made of tinned\r\ncopper, and is fitted with three glasses, one at the front and one on\r\neach side, so as to afford the diver as wide a view as is consistent\r\nwith strength of construction. It has a valve by which he can regulate\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere. The dress has a double collar, the inner\r\nportion coming up around the neck, and the other hermetically fastened\r\nto the breastplate. The breastplate is likewise made of copper. The suit\r\nis connected with the air-pump by means of a stout rubber tube which\r\nenters the helmet, and through which air is supplied to the diver\r\nincased therein. This air-tube consists of three or four lengths—each of\r\nfifty feet—of light hose, commonly called “pipe.” This is buoyant so\r\nthat it may be easily pulled along, and may not readily foul among the\r\nrocks. However, when working on very rough bottom with sharp-edged\r\nstones, the lower length is of stouter material in order to resist the\r\nchafing on the bottom. Before descending, the air-line is loosely coiled\r\naround the diver’s arm to prevent a sudden strain on it when it is\r\ntightened, and a signal-line is attached to his waist to enable him to\r\ncommunicate with the men above.\r\n\r\nIn fishing, if the current is slight, the boat is permitted to drift\r\ntherewith, and if there is little or no current, it is propelled by oars\r\nas may be required. The diver—fully dressed in the rubber suit with\r\nhelmet, etc.,—goes overboard easily by means of a Jacob’s ladder of five\r\nor six rungs on the port side of the boat, and is lowered by an\r\nattendant, who gives close attention to the lines, the crew having\r\nmanned the pump in the meantime. On reaching bottom, the diver walks\r\nalong, following the course of the moving boat and swinging his\r\nshoulders from side to side to take in a wide vision in his search for\r\noysters. In clear water he can discover them at a distance of\r\ntwenty-five or thirty feet, even when fifteen fathoms below the surface;\r\nbut sometimes the water is so clouded that it may be necessary for him\r\nto go almost on hands and knees to see them, and when the seaweeds are\r\nthick and high, he may locate them almost as much by feeling as by\r\nsight. Owing to this difficulty in seeing the oysters, the work is\r\nsuspended in rough weather and for many days following. The catch is\r\nplaced in a sack or basket of quarter inch rope, which is raised when\r\nfilled, emptied, and returned to the bottom by means of a rope.\r\n\r\nFinding the shell is by no means an easy matter, and much natural\r\nhunter-craft is necessary. Of a neutral color, it is not at all\r\nconspicuous as it lies on a gray coral bed, itself covered with coral or\r\nsponge or hidden in dense masses of gorgeous seaweeds. Still less\r\nvisible is the shell on a muddy bottom, for there it embeds itself and\r\nexposes only half an inch or so of the “lip.” As the boat is impelled by\r\nthe tide, the diver may have to walk rapidly in a swinging gait; and if\r\nhe should stumble or fall while stooping to pick up the shell, recovery\r\nof balance may be difficult. He must be constantly on the alert and has\r\nmany dangers to avoid. Sharks are numerous in these clear tropical\r\nwaters; but although disaster sometimes results, they are timid, a\r\nstream of air bubbles from the sleeve of the dress sending them away in\r\nfright. More fruitful sources of danger are fouled air-pipes, broken\r\npumps, falling into holes, and especially paralysis from recklessly deep\r\ndiving.\r\n\r\nWhen the diver wishes to come up, he closes the escape valve in his\r\nhelmet; his dress fills and distends with air, causing a speedy return\r\nto the surface, and the tender hauls him alongside by means of the\r\nlife-line. After “blowing” for a few minutes with the helmet removed,\r\nand usually enjoying the indispensable cigarette, he returns to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mergui reefs were first exploited by diving apparatus, the bulk\r\nof the shells were secured from depths of ten to twelve fathoms. These\r\nshallow reefs have been exhausted, temporarily, at least, and the divers\r\nnow work in deeper water, fifteen, twenty, and even twenty-five fathoms,\r\nif the bottom is very uneven and rocky. Many shells are found in the\r\ndepressions between the large boulders, which may be twenty or thirty\r\nfeet deeper than the surrounding areas.\r\n\r\nThe oysters are opened by means of the long-bladed working-knife of the\r\ncountry, known as _dah-she_. The flesh is thrown into a large basket or\r\nwashtub, where it is searched by the proprietor of the boat, who takes\r\neach piece between the hands and squeezes and feels through every part\r\nof it. After the flesh has been carefully examined, the sediment at the\r\nbottom of the tub is washed and panned to obtain those pearls which have\r\nfallen through the flesh tissues. The Mergui pearls are commonly of good\r\ncolor and luster, and compare favorably with those from the Sulu\r\nArchipelago or the Dutch East Indies.\r\n\r\nThe sea-green shell of the snail (_Turbo marmoratus_) is gathered in\r\nlarge quantities by the nude diving Selangs, who barter it to Chinese\r\ntraders at the equivalent of Rs.8 or 10 per 100 in number. The flesh is\r\nalso dried and disposed of to these traders under the name of\r\n_thadecon_, at about Rs.3 per _viss_ of 3.33 pounds. This mollusk yields\r\na few greenish yellow pearls.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, three pearl reefs were discovered off the Bassein coast in the\r\ndistrict of Irawadi.[165] These proved fairly remunerative for one\r\nseason and a portion of another, when they were abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE PEARL FISHERIES OF THE RED SEA, GULF OF ADEN, ETC.\r\n\r\n  Under the Ptolemies, and even long after—under the Califs—these were\r\n  islands whose merchants were princes; but their bustle and glory\r\n  have since departed from them, and they are now thinly inhabited by\r\n  a race of miserable fishermen.\r\n\r\n                                                   JAMES BRUCE (1790).\r\n\r\nThe Red Sea was one of the most ancient sources of pearls, furnishing\r\nthese gems for centuries before the Christian era, and particularly\r\nduring the reign of the Ptolemies. These pearls were alluded to by\r\nStrabo, Ælianus, and other classical writers. Although the prominence of\r\nthe fisheries has suffered by comparison with those of Persia and\r\nCeylon, the yield has been more or less extensive from the days of\r\nSolomon up to the present time.\r\n\r\nOf the several pearl-yielding mollusks in the Red Sea and on the\r\nsoutheast coast of Arabia, the largest and best known is that called\r\n“sadof” by the Arabs, and which has been identified by Jameson as\r\n_Margaritifera m. erythræensis_. This is closely related to the large\r\nspecies in the Persian Gulf. It is commonly four or five inches in\r\ndiameter, and in exceptional instances attains a diameter of eight\r\ninches and a weight of three pounds or more. In addition to its size, it\r\nis distinguished by a dark green coloring about the edges, and a more or\r\nless greenish tint over the nacreous interior surface; this color is\r\ndarker in the vicinity of Jiddah and Suakin than at the southern end of\r\nthe sea, or in the Gulf of Aden. This species occurs singly rather than\r\ncongregated in beds or reefs. Although it is found in depths of fifteen\r\nfathoms or more, most of the fishing is in less than five fathoms of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, the pearling center of the world\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe “sadof” yields pearls only rarely, and is sought principally for the\r\nshells, which afford good qualities of mother-of-pearl, the pearls\r\nfurnishing an additional but always looked-for profit to the regular\r\nsource of income. As in other regions, there is no constant relation\r\nbetween the value of the pearls and the quantity of mollusks taken. The\r\noysters of some reefs are comparatively rich in certain years; while in\r\nother seasons or on other reefs the mollusks may be numerous but yield\r\nvery few pearls.\r\n\r\nThe second species of importance in the Red Sea is similar to the Lingah\r\noyster and is known to the Arabs as “bulbul.” This is much smaller than\r\nthe “sadof,” averaging less than three inches in diameter. It is\r\ncollected for the pearls exclusively, the shells being too small for\r\nindustrial use; but only 3 or 4 per cent. of the individuals yield\r\npearls.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by writers of authority that it is the red Pinna pearl\r\nfrom this sea that is referred to in the Scriptures under the name\r\n_peninim_ as the most precious product, and which has been translated as\r\nrubies.[166] The shell is extremely fragile, and the nacreous interior\r\nis white tinged with a beautiful red. It is of little importance in the\r\ncommercial fisheries of the Red Sea at the present time.\r\n\r\nThe “sadof” is more scattered and less numerous than the “bulbul”; and\r\nin order to save much useless diving, it is customary to inspect the\r\nbottom before descending. Therefore, operations are largely restricted\r\nto calm weather, when the water is sufficiently clear to enable the\r\ndivers to sight the individual oysters on the bottom. In recent years,\r\nwater-telescopes have been used to assist in locating them. The most\r\npopular form consists of a tin can with a sheet of glass inserted in the\r\nbottom. The glazed end of the tin is submerged several inches below the\r\nsurface, affording a far-reaching and much clearer vision. In this\r\nfishery the divers work from small canoes (_uri_), each manned by two\r\nmen, one of whom rows while the other leans over the bow and searches\r\nfor the oysters. When one is sighted, he dives into the water for it,\r\nand then returns to the boat to resume the search.\r\n\r\nThe pearling season begins commonly in March or April, and continues\r\nuntil about the end of May; it is renewed in the autumn, continuing\r\nthrough September and October.[167] The vessels employed are of two\r\nvarieties: _dhows_ carrying from twenty to eighty men each, and the much\r\nsmaller _sambuks_ or sail-boats without decks, each with from six to\r\ntwenty-five men, most of whom are Negro slaves. Many of the large\r\nvessels are from the Persian Gulf. The _sambuks_ are owned principally\r\nby Zobeid Bedouins inhabiting the coast between Jiddah and Yambo, and\r\nalso the islands near the southern end of the sea, which are very\r\nhot-beds of pearls, shells, religious frenzy and half famished Arabs and\r\nNegro slaves.\r\n\r\nThe “bulbul” oysters are taken in nearly the same manner as in the\r\nPersian Gulf. When the vessel is located over the reef, each diver\r\ndescends, commonly with a short stick of iron or hard wood, with which\r\nhe releases the oysters within reach; placing them in a sack, he is\r\npulled up by an attendant when his breath is nearly exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries are prosecuted along both sides of the Red Sea and in the\r\nchannels among the islands, from the Gulf of Akabah to Bab-el-Mandeb.\r\nThey are especially extensive among the Dahlak Islands on the coast of\r\nthe Italian colony Eritrea, where the population is largely supported by\r\nthem. This was the center of the industry during the time of the\r\nPtolemies and in the early Christian era. The fisheries are also\r\nimportant in the vicinity of Jiddah, the port of entrance for Mecca and\r\nMedina, holiest places of Islam. They likewise exist near Kosseir at the\r\nnorthern end of the sea, and at Suakin, Massawa, the Farsan Islands, and\r\nLoheia, near the lower end. They are carried on by Arabs, who succeed in\r\nevading efforts at control on the part of the local governments. Even on\r\nthe African side, the Arab fishermen predominate, for the native\r\nEgyptian has never evinced much fondness for venturing on the sea.\r\n\r\nOn the southeast coast of Arabia, pearl fishermen are to be found at the\r\nvarious harbors from Aden to Muscat. Their fantastic dhows are met with\r\nin the harbor of Makalla, and also in that of Shehr. On the Oman coast,\r\nthe ports of Sur and of sun-scorched Muscat do a considerable pearling\r\nbusiness, not only locally but to the Sokotra Islands, and even on the\r\ncoast of East Africa and Zanzibar, the trading baggalas adding pearling\r\nand illicit slave-trading to their many sources of income. A number of\r\nthese traders, each with an instinct for pearls equal to that of a\r\ntrained hound for game, visit the fishing centers at intervals, and\r\nexchange needful commodities for pearls and shells.\r\n\r\nThe Arab pearl-divers of the Red Sea have been noted for the depths to\r\nwhich they can descend. Lieutenant J. R. Wellsted, of the Indian Navy,\r\nwho had unusual facilities for acquaintance with their exploits,\r\nreported that in the Persian Gulf the fishermen rarely descended beyond\r\neleven or twelve fathoms, and even then they exhibited signs of\r\nexhaustion; but that in the Red Sea they go down twice that depth. Among\r\nthe most noted of these divers of the last century was old Serúr, who\r\nattracted the notice of many travelers. Lieutenant Wellsted states that\r\nhe saw him descend repeatedly to twenty-five fathoms without the\r\nslightest evidence of distress; that he frequently dived in thirty\r\nfathoms, and is reported to have brought up mud from the bottom at a\r\ndepth of thirty-five fathoms, which is about the record, the pressure of\r\nthe water being nearly 90 pounds to the square inch. His sons were also\r\nremarkably expert; one of them when scarcely thirteen years of age would\r\ndescend to a depth of twenty-five fathoms.[168]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CARVED “JERUSALEM SHELL” FROM THE RED SEA\r\n\r\n  In the collection of Dr. Bashford Dean\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn interesting story of an Arab’s diving ability is told by Lieutenant\r\nWellsted: “In 1827, we were cruising in the sloop _Ternate_ on the pearl\r\nbanks. Whilst becalmed and drifting slowly along with the current,\r\nseveral of the officers and men were looking over the side at our Arab\r\npilot, who had been amusing himself in diving for oysters. After several\r\nattempts, his search proved unsuccessful. ‘Since I cannot get oysters I\r\nwill now,’ said he, ‘dive for and catch fish.’ All ridiculed the idea.\r\nHe went down again, and great was our astonishment to see him, after a\r\nshort time, rise to the surface with a small rock-fish in each hand. His\r\nown explanation of the feat was, that as he seated himself at the\r\nbottom, the fish came around and nibbled at his skin. Watching his\r\nopportunity, he seized and secured his prey by thrusting his thumb and\r\nforefinger into their expanded gills.”[169]\r\n\r\nOwing to the character of the fishery and the lack of government\r\nsupervision, it is extremely difficult to determine accurately the\r\nextent of this industry in the Red Sea and the Arabian Gulf. All over\r\nthis coast extends the influence of the Hindu traders, who finance the\r\nfisheries and purchase most of the catch. The pearls are sent mostly to\r\nBombay, and are not reported in the official returns of the Red Sea\r\nports. The fishermen are suspicious of outside inquiries, and are far\r\nfrom anxious to impart reliable information. Probably the best estimates\r\nof the catch are to be obtained from Bombay merchants, from whom A.\r\nPerazzoli learned in 1898 that pearls to the value of 2,000,000 lire\r\n($400,000) were carried from the Red Sea to Bombay each year.[170] In\r\nthe last four or five years the output has been smaller than usual,\r\nowing to disturbed political conditions.\r\n\r\nThe annual product of “Egyptian” and “Bombay” shells in these fisheries\r\nis usually upward of 1000 tons, worth from $100 to $600 per ton,\r\naccording to quality. Most of these go to Austria and France, only about\r\n200 tons reaching London each year. Owing to the dark color and the lack\r\nof thickness in the nacreous layer, they are scarcely suitable for\r\nanything else than button manufacture. Many of them are sent to\r\nBethlehem and Jerusalem, where they are cut into various shapes for\r\ncrosses, crucifixes, wafer-boxes, beads, and nearly every conceivable\r\narticle in which mother-of-pearl is manufactured. Many of the choicest\r\nshells are incised with scriptural or allegorical designs for sale to\r\ntourists as well as for export. The best of the engraved shells sell for\r\n$10 to $50, and the cheaper ones for less than $1 each. This industry is\r\nof great importance in Bethlehem, giving employment to a considerable\r\npercentage of the eight thousand inhabitants of the village.\r\n\r\nDoubtless in no pearl fishery in the world are greater hardships endured\r\nthan in the Red Sea and along the coast of the Arabian Gulf. In\r\npractically every other region, the industry is carried on under\r\ngovernment supervision, and there is little opportunity for\r\nill-treatment of the humbler fishermen. But the fanatics who control the\r\nfishery on the Arabian coast—untrammeled by authorities and responsible\r\nto none—show little consideration for the poor divers, and particularly\r\nfor the unfortunate black slaves brought from the coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nThese pearl fishermen lead a very eventful life, the divers especially.\r\nThey see some wonderful sights down below the surface-plant life and\r\ncreeping things and enemies innumerable. Dropping from the sun-scorched\r\nsurface down into the deep cool waters, everything shows “a sea change,\r\ninto something rich and strange,” just as the eyes of the drowned man in\r\nAriel’s song are turned into pearls and his bones into coral.\r\n\r\nAnd there are enemies innumerable. The terrible sharks, prowling about\r\nnear the bottom, prove a source of perpetual uneasiness, and in the\r\naggregate many fishermen are eaten by these bloodthirsty tigers of the\r\nsea. There are horrible conflicts with devil-fish equaling that in\r\nHugo’s “Toilers of the Sea.” The saw-fish is also a source of danger,\r\nparticularly in the Arabian Gulf, and instances are reported in which\r\ndivers have been cut in two by these animals, which sometimes attain a\r\nlength of twelve or fifteen feet, and possess a saw five feet long and\r\nthree inches broad, armed on each edge with teeth two inches in length.\r\nAnother menacing peril is the giant clam (_Tridacna gigas_), a monster\r\nbivalve, whose shell measures two or three feet in diameter, and is\r\nfirmly anchored to the bottom. This mollusk occurs on many of the\r\nAsiatic pearling grounds. Lying with the scalloped edges a foot or more\r\napart, a foot or a hand of the diver may be accidentally inserted. When\r\nsuch a fate befalls a fisherman, the only escape is for him to amputate\r\nthe member immediately. Once in a while on the pearling shores a native\r\nmay be found who has been maimed in this manner, but usually the\r\nunfortunate man does not escape with his life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CAP OF STATE, FROM LOOTING OF SUMMER PALACE, PEKIN, IN 1860\r\n\r\n  Now in South Kensington Museum\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE PEARL FISHERIES OF CHINA, JAPAN, SIBERIA, ETC.\r\n\r\n                                      Do churls\r\n                Know the worth of Orient pearls?\r\n                Give the gem which dims the moon\r\n                To the noblest or to none.\r\n\r\n                                  EMERSON, _Friendship_.\r\n\r\nIt appears from ancient Chinese literature, noted in the first chapter\r\nof this book, that pearl fisheries have existed in the rivers of China\r\nfor several thousand years. The Chinese also derived pearls from the\r\nsea, and especially from the coast of the province of Che-kiang. Little\r\nis known of the early fisheries, but the fragmentary literature contains\r\nso many allusions to pearls as to lead us to believe that they were of\r\nconsiderable extent and importance.\r\n\r\nIt is related that about 200 B.C., a pearl dealer at Shao-hing, an\r\nancient city between Hang-chau and Ning-po, on the shore of Hang-chau\r\nBay, furnished to the empress a pearl one inch in diameter, for which he\r\nreceived five hundred pieces of silver; and to an envious princess the\r\nsame dealer sold a “four-inch pearl.” A hundred years later, the\r\nreigning emperor sent an agent to the coast to purchase “moon pearls,”\r\nthe largest of which were two thirds of an inch in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century A.D., Mingti, one of the most extravagant of the\r\nearly monarchs, used so many pearls—not only in his personal decoration\r\nbut on his equipage and retinue,—that after a formal procession the way\r\nwould be rich in the jewels which dropped from the gorgeous cortège.\r\nAbout 1000 A.D., an embassy to the emperor brought as tribute an\r\nornament composed of strings of pearls, and also 105 liang (8¾ lbs.) of\r\nthe same gems unmounted.\r\n\r\nAn interesting story is told of “pearl-scattering” by an embassy to the\r\nChinese court from a Malayan state about 1060. Following the customs of\r\ntheir country, the ambassadors knelt at the threshold of the audience\r\nchamber, and then advanced toward the throne, bearing a golden goblet\r\nfilled with choice pearls and water-lilies wrought of gold. These they\r\nscattered upon the floor at the feet of the emperor; and the courtiers,\r\nhastening to pick them up, secured ten hang (15 oz.) of pearls.[171]\r\n\r\nThe Keh Chi King Yuen, a Chinese encyclopedia, describes a pearl fishery\r\nin the southern part of Kwang-tung province, in the department of\r\nLien-chau and near the city of Hóhpú. Fishing began in the spring, and\r\nwas preceded by conciliating the gods through certain sacrifices, in\r\norder that the weather might be propitious and that no disaster might be\r\nsuffered through sharks and other agencies. The five sacrificial\r\nanimals,—horses, cattle, sheep, swine, and fowls,—were presented; but\r\nordinarily paper images of these were economically substituted, as\r\nequally acceptable to the Chinese rulers of destiny. In the details of\r\nthe diving, the fishery resembled somewhat that prosecuted about the\r\nsame period in the Gulf of Manaar. The diver was let down by a rope, and\r\nafter collecting the mollusks and placing them in a basket, he was drawn\r\nup at a given signal. Much complaint was made that the divers would open\r\nthe mollusks, extract the pearls and conceal them in the mouth before\r\nreturning to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe business became so perilous and the loss so great, that about the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century, according to the same encyclopedia,\r\ndredges were adopted. These at first were simple rakes; later large\r\ndredges were trailed along between two boats, by means of which great\r\nquantities of shells were gathered. So important was the industry that\r\nan officer was designated by the viceroy of Canton to collect a revenue\r\ntherefrom. It does not appear that pearls have been collected in\r\nconsiderable numbers on this part of the Chinese coast for very many\r\nyears, probably not since the advent of Europeans.\r\n\r\nPearls are yet found in the river mussels in all parts of eastern Asia,\r\nfrom Siberia to the Indian Ocean, and from the Himalayas to the Pacific.\r\nIt is represented that they are not from the _Unio margaritifera_, the\r\ncommon river-mussel of Europe, but from other species, such as _Unio\r\nmongolicus_, _U. dahuricus_, _Dipsas plicatus_, etc. It is quite\r\nimpossible to obtain a reliable estimate of the total number of persons\r\nemployed, or the output of pearls in China, but these items are\r\ncertainly very much larger than the average Occidental believes.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Canton the _Dipsas plicatus_ has been used for\r\ncenturies by the Chinese in the production of artificial pearls, this\r\nindustry giving employment to thousands of persons.[172]\r\n\r\nThe pearl-mussel fishery is of importance in Manchuria, where it has\r\nbeen carried on for hundreds of years, not only by the citizens, but by\r\nthe military department on account of the government, and especially in\r\nthe streams which flow into the Songari, a tributary of the Amur.\r\nJacinth relates that in case of a deficit, the officers and subalterns\r\nwere punished by a deduction from their pay, and also by corporal\r\nchastisement.[173] Witsen speaks of the pearls from the River Gan, a\r\ntributary of the Amur, and also from the islands of the Amur, the\r\nboundary river of Manchuria. Pearl fisheries were established at these\r\nplaces by the Russians nearly two centuries ago.[174]\r\n\r\nPearls become finer and more plentiful the further we penetrate into\r\nManchuria; and they are numerous in the lake of Heikow or Hing-chou-men,\r\n“Black Lake” or “Gate of Precious Gems,” where they have long been\r\nexploited for the account of the emperor of China.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of pearls in many parts of Asiatic Russia was noted by\r\nVon Hessling. In northern Siberia, according to Witsen, writing in\r\n1705,[175] pearls were found in the waters about the town of Mangasea on\r\nthe Turuchan; and Von Middendorf notes that they were found in the\r\nTunguska River, which flows into the Yenisei. Whether, however, they\r\ncome from the _Unio margaritifera_ is considered doubtful by Von\r\nMiddendorf. Witsen referred to their occurrence in the rivers and\r\nstreams of Irkutsk and Onon, and this is confirmed by several writers of\r\nmore recent times. Pallas says that the mussels found there are quite\r\nlarge, and speaks of the Ilim, which flows into the Angara, as another\r\nriver where they occur.\r\n\r\nAncient books relating to Japan repeatedly allude to the occurrence of\r\npearls on the coasts of that country. They are mentioned in the Nihonki,\r\nof the eighth century, the oldest Japanese history.\r\n\r\nTavernier wrote about 1670: “It is possible that of those who have\r\nwritten before me concerning pearls, none have recorded that some years\r\nback a fishery was discovered in a certain part of the coasts of Japan,\r\nand I have seen some of the pearls which the Dutch brought from thence.\r\nThey were of very beautiful water, and some of them of large size, but\r\nall baroques. The Japanese do not esteem pearls. If they cared about\r\nthem it is possible that by their means some banks might be discovered\r\nwhere finer ones would be obtained.”[176]\r\n\r\nIn 1727, Kaempfer wrote that pearls, called by the Japanese _kainotamma_\r\nor shell jewels, were found in oysters and other mollusks almost\r\neverywhere about Saikokf. Every person was at liberty to fish for them.\r\nFormerly the natives had little or no value for them, till they learned\r\nof their estimation by the Chinese, who were ready to pay good prices\r\nfor them, their women being very proud of wearing necklaces and other\r\nornaments of pearls. “The largest and finest pearls are found in the\r\nsmall sort of oysters, called _akoja_, which is not unlike the Persian\r\npearl-oyster. These are found only in the seas about Satzuma and in the\r\nGulf of Omura (Kiusiu). Some of the pearls weigh from four to five\r\ncandareens[177] and these are sold for a hundred kobans each.[178] The\r\ninhabitants of the Loochoo Islands buy most of those about Satzuma,\r\nsince they trade to that province. Those found on the Gulf of Omura are\r\nsold chiefly to the Chinese and Tunquinese, and it is computed that they\r\nbuy for about 3000 taels[179] a year. This great profit occasioned the\r\nstrict orders, which were made not long ago by the princes both of\r\nSatzuma and Omura, that for the future there should be no more of these\r\noysters sold in the market with other oysters, as had been done\r\nformerly.”[180]\r\n\r\nKaempfer also noted that the Japanese obtained pearls from the yellow\r\nsnail shell and from the _taira gai_ (Placuna) in the Gulf of Arima, and\r\nespecially from the awabi or abalone (Haliotis). This mollusk was much\r\nsought after for food, being taken in large quantities by the\r\nfishermen’s wives, “they being the best divers of the country.”[181]\r\n\r\nOf the several species of pearl-oysters which occur in the coastal\r\nwaters of Japan, the only one of importance at present is the\r\n_Margaritifera martensi_. While this occurs in very many localities, it\r\nis most numerous among the southern islands, where some fine pearls have\r\nbeen secured. The fishery for this species was quite extensive thirty or\r\nforty years ago, and the reefs were largely depleted. For nearly a score\r\nof years it has been used in growing culture pearls, an account of which\r\nis given on pages 292, 293.\r\n\r\nA few pearls are obtained from several other bivalve mollusks in Japan.\r\nAmong the collections of the present writers are pearls from\r\n_Margaritifera martensi_, collected at Bay Agu; from _M. panasisæ_,\r\nabout the Liu-kiu Islands; from _Pecten yezocusis_, in Sokhaido; from\r\n_Mytilus crasitesta_, in the Inland Sea, and from North Japan, and from\r\na species of Dipsas found in Lake Biwa.\r\n\r\nWhile the pearl fisheries of Japan are not of great importance in any\r\nsingle locality, the distribution of the reefs is so extensive that the\r\naggregate yield is considerable.\r\n\r\nThe awabi or ear-shell (_Haliotis gigantea_), found on the coast of\r\nJapan, Korea, etc., yields many pearly forms. This species is much\r\nsmaller than the California abalones. It has a fairly smooth, nacreous\r\nsurface, but its value is depreciated by the great size of the marginal\r\nperforations, which render useless for commercial purposes all of the\r\nshell external to the line of perforations. While its opalescent tints\r\nmake it desirable for manufacturing into certain styles of buttons and\r\nbuckles, its principal use is for inlaying work or marquetry, for which\r\nit is especially adapted, owing to its fineness of texture and beauty of\r\ncoloring even when reduced to thin sheets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FISHING FOR THE AWABI (ABALONE) SHELLS AT WADA-NO-HARA, JAPAN\r\n]\r\n\r\nProbably the most interesting of the abalone fisheries is that on the\r\nshores of Quelpaerd Island, about sixty miles south of the Korean coast,\r\nwhich is prosecuted largely by the women. Dressed only in a scanty\r\ngarment, these women swim out to the fishing grounds, distant several\r\nhundred yards in some cases, carrying with them a stout knife and a\r\nsmall sack suspended from a gourd. On reaching the reefs, they dive to\r\nthe bottom—sometimes to a depth of six or eight fathoms—and by means of\r\nthe knife, remove the abalones from the bottom and place them in the\r\nsack. They may remain out an hour, diving repeatedly until the sack is\r\nfilled, when they swim back to the shore. Pearls are found only rarely;\r\nin one lot of one hundred shells, only five were found bearing pearls;\r\ntwo with three pearls each, two with two pearls each, and one with a\r\nsingle pearl. The flesh of this mollusk after it has been cleaned and\r\ndried, is quite popular as an article of diet. Although white when\r\nfresh, the color changes to a dark red. The pieces of dried flesh, in\r\nthe form of flat reddish disks four or five inches in diameter, are\r\nfastened on slender sticks—about ten to each stick—and displayed in the\r\ngrocery shops in Seul and other cities.\r\n\r\nIn the Gulf of Siam on the Asiatic coast, pearls are obtained from a\r\nsmall oyster with a thin shell, presumably a variety of the Lingah\r\noyster. The beds have not yet been thoroughly exploited, as the Siamese\r\ndo not especially value pearls, attributing some superstitious\r\nsentiments of ill luck to them. However, from time to time Chinese\r\ntraders have bought them from the Malay divers and sold them at great\r\nprofit in the Singapore market. The known beds occur chiefly in the\r\nnorthern part of the gulf, on the west coast, and extend in a narrow\r\nbelt for a distance of about one hundred miles. The fishing is\r\nprosecuted by nude divers in shallow water. A recent letter from Dr. K.\r\nVan Dort, a mining engineer of Bangkok, Siam, states that in 1906 in six\r\nweeks, with the aid of half a dozen divers he was able to collect 720\r\ngrains’ weight of pearls, mostly small ones, but including one of 20\r\ngrains, one of 14 grains, two of 12 grains each, and seven over 9 grains\r\nin weight. He reports that the total value of the large ones in Bangkok\r\nwas $1500, but the small ones could not be sold to any advantage, as\r\nthey are little prized by the Siamese. The shells are of no commercial\r\nvalue, as they are too thin for industrial use other than for inlaid\r\nwork. Some fine old specimens of marquetry in which these shells were\r\nused exist in the Buddhist temples at Bangkok. This art of inlaying is\r\nalmost lost among the Siamese, and there is said to be only one man in\r\nthe king’s palace who can lay any claims to proficiency in working\r\nmother-of-pearl shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\n                     PEARLS FROM THE AFRICAN COASTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n                      EAST AFRICAN PEARL FISHERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n                   The Islanders with fleecy curls,\r\n     Whose homes are compass’d by the Arabian waves;\r\n     By whom those shells which breed the orient pearls\r\n     Are dived and fish’d for in their green sea caves.\r\n\r\n                                     TASSO, _Jerusalem Delivered_.\r\n\r\nThe principal pearl fisheries of the coasts of Africa are those\r\nprosecuted in the Red Sea, between this continent and Asia. These have\r\nalready been described in the preceding chapter, among the Asiatic\r\nfisheries; for, although situated between the two continents, they are\r\nprosecuted largely by Arabs rather than by natives of the western shores\r\nof the sea.\r\n\r\nOther than those in the Red Sea, the only pearl resources in Africa\r\nwhich have received attention are on the eastern coast, south of the\r\nGulf of Aden. Little information exists as to the origin of these\r\nfisheries. In a paper published by the Lisbon Geographical Society,\r\nJanuary, 1903, Señor Ivens Ferranz states that, according to tradition,\r\nin remote times the Ibo Archipelago, on the northeast coast of\r\nPortuguese East Africa, was inhabited by a Semitic colony, which located\r\nthere to fish for pearls, and these were carried through the Red Sea to\r\nKing Solomon. He adds that there is little doubt that, after the great\r\nemigration which started from the Persian Gulf in 982 and founded\r\nZanzibar, Kilwa, and Sofala on this coast, some Arabs engaged in fishing\r\nfor pearls about the islands near Sofala.\r\n\r\nIn 1609 Joao dos Santos wrote that on the sandy sea bottom about the\r\nBazaruto Islands, which are about 150 miles south of Sofala, there were\r\nmany large oysters which bore pearls, and the natives fished for them by\r\ndiving in practically the same manner as in the Persian Gulf.[182]\r\n\r\nIn a personal memorandum, Sir Robert Edgcumbe states that in the very\r\nearly times of Portuguese exploitation on the eastern coast of Africa,\r\npearl fishing was carried on in these waters. For a long period the\r\ntenure of power exerted by the Portuguese was of a feeble character;\r\nthey practically occupied no position of importance on the mainland, but\r\nseized upon stations on the islands which offered decent harbors. Thus\r\ntheir chief settlements, such as Mozambique and Ibo, were on islands\r\nlying off the coast, and until recent years they made no serious attempt\r\nto occupy the mainland.\r\n\r\nArabs and Banyans carried on the commercial traffic of the country, as\r\nthey still do, and they were more truly the masters of this coast than\r\nwere the Portuguese, who were little more than nominal rulers. Trading\r\nto and from India in their small dhows, the Arabs and Banyans had full\r\nknowledge of the value of pearls, and undoubtedly secured all that were\r\nobtainable. But they observed no restrictions, and without doubt—for a\r\ntime, at any rate—greatly impaired the productive power of the\r\nfisheries.\r\n\r\nThe principal pearl reefs of East Africa, so far as known at present,\r\nextend along the coast of the German East African territory from the\r\nProvince of Uzaramo to the Rovuma River, the southern limit of that\r\nterritory, and also into Portuguese East Africa as far south as Pemba\r\nBay, a total distance of about 300 miles. Along much of this coast,\r\nthere are islands lying from one to two miles off shore, and between\r\nthese islands are barriers of reefs, which create a series of lagoons.\r\nIn these lagoons, protected by the islands and the reefs from the\r\ninfluence of the surf formed by the Indian monsoons, there are large\r\npatches of coral rock and groups of living coral, which form excellent\r\nattachments for the pearl-oysters.\r\n\r\nIt is only recently that serious attention has been paid to these pearl\r\nresources, although year by year a considerable number of pearls have\r\nbeen collected by the natives and sold to Arabs and Banyans, who have\r\nsent them chiefly to India by way of Zanzibar. The natives of these\r\nparts are not very expert in diving, and they collect the oysters\r\nprincipally by wading out as far as they can at low tide. They do not\r\nwait for the mollusks to attain a proper age, and as a result they find\r\nfew pearls of large size. Many parcels of pearls fished in this very\r\nelementary way pass through the custom-house, where they are subject to\r\na small duty for export, and others are smuggled out of the country.\r\nQuantities of seed-pearls are sent to India, where they are used\r\nprincipally as a medicine and in cosmetics; and occasionally there are\r\nrumors that some choice pearls have been discovered.\r\n\r\nIn the German territory a concession of the fisheries was granted a few\r\nyears ago to Dr. Aurel Schulz; and, although we are not in position to\r\nsay what success he has met with, it is reported that he has secured a\r\nconsiderable number of pearls under four grains in weight, of fair shape\r\nand quality and of good marketable value.\r\n\r\nA concession of the pearl fishery on the Portuguese coast north of Ibo\r\nhas been granted to the East African Pearl Company. For this company an\r\nexamination of the resources is now being made by Mr. James J. Simpson,\r\nacting under direction of Prof. W. A. Herdman, of the Liverpool\r\nUniversity, the technical advisor of the Ceylon Company of Pearl\r\nFishers.\r\n\r\nAt least four species of pearl-bearing mollusks exist here; these are\r\n_Margaritifera vulgaris_, _M. margaritifera_, _Pinna nobilis_, and a\r\nspecies of Perna, named in the order of their importance. A preliminary\r\nreport of Mr. Simpson (supplied through the courtesy of Sir Robert\r\nEdgcumbe), states that among the Ibo Islands about one half of the\r\nbottom is sandy and the other half is covered with detached pieces of\r\ncoral rock, groups of living corals, masses of nullipore, and expanses\r\nof fixed seaweed. On all of these in the shoal waters, there is such an\r\nabundance of pearl-oysters (_M. vulgaris_) that a single diver, by\r\nsimply descending and bringing up a few in his hands each time, can\r\nsecure about 200 in fifteen minutes. Oysters also occur singly on the\r\nsandy bottom, but not so abundantly. Within the three-year-old oysters\r\nthere are many seed-pearls. It is evident that there has been an\r\nextensive removal of large oysters in recent years and that large pearls\r\nwere then found; but the depredations of the natives now prevent the\r\nmollusks from attaining an age and size which render them useful as\r\npearl-bearers.\r\n\r\nSaid Mr. Simpson in his report: “The women here play great havoc on the\r\nreefs by going out daily and collecting the pearl-oysters at low tide.\r\nAll along the coast from Muliga Point to Arimba the shores are covered\r\nwith shells. At one place we came across a heap of freshly-opened\r\noysters which consisted of thirty or forty thousand at the lowest\r\nestimate; while an older heap contained between forty to sixty millions.\r\nFour women who were fishing on the reefs while we were there had over\r\ntwo thousand oysters in their baskets. Thus it is evident that immense\r\nquantities are annually destroyed. And the worst feature is that out of\r\nthose destroyed, not one per cent. were over two years old.”\r\n\r\nIt is the intention of the East African Pearl Company, as soon as the\r\ninvestigation of the resources is completed, to police the fishing\r\ngrounds so as to put an end to the removal of immature oysters, which\r\nyield only seed-pearls, and to permit them to attain maturity. In\r\naddition to this, it is their purpose to utilize the extensive beds of\r\noysters lying in comparatively deep water, which are now inaccessible to\r\nthe natives owing to their lack of diving skill.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Edgcumbe writes that it is impossible to say more at present\r\nthan that these fisheries at one time bore a high repute, and that the\r\noysters have continued to exist in multitudes though fished by the\r\nnatives in the immature state; and there is every indication that if\r\nproperly policed and worked in a scientific way these fisheries should\r\nonce again become of much importance. The fact that the pearl-bearing\r\noysters are found there in large quantities, notwithstanding that they\r\nhave been poached without restriction by the natives, indicates that\r\nonly proper management and policing are necessary to make them valuable\r\nand productive.\r\n\r\nOn the lower coast of Portuguese East Africa, pearl fishing has been of\r\nsome local importance. The reefs are most extensive about the Bazaruto\r\nIslands, previously referred to as about 150 miles south of Sofala. In\r\n1888, when famine prevailed on this coast, the inhabitants of this\r\narchipelago, of both sexes and of all ages, fished for the large\r\npearl-oysters (known locally as _mapalo_), selling their catch at\r\nChiloane to Asiatic traders, who gave them a handful of rice for a large\r\nbasket of the mollusks. It was estimated that during two months of that\r\nyear, pearls to the value of eighty _contos_ ($83,500) were taken.[183]\r\nIn 1889 three British subjects attempted to renew the fishery by using\r\ndredges, but without success, owing, it is said, to the great weight of\r\nthe implements.\r\n\r\nThe Kafirs of Bazaruto continue to fish irregularly, but their catch is\r\nnot of importance. These pearls are carried by traders to Zanzibar,\r\nMuscat, and Bombay. The American consul writes that some years ago the\r\nPortuguese government granted a concession to a company of American\r\nfishermen to exploit the Bazaruto reefs, but the attempt to work the\r\nconcession failed through “bad management, lack of funds, heavy\r\nexpenses, and political difficulties,” a combination apparently\r\nsufficient to wreck a similar attempt in the most favorable locality.\r\n\r\nThe American consul at Tamatave states that in 1907 the government of\r\nMadagascar awarded two grants for pearl fisheries, covering the entire\r\nwestern coast, a distance of one thousand miles, excepting two hundred\r\nmiles, for which two grants were given in 1906. Apparently no effort was\r\nmade to develop the earlier grants; the later ones may be operated,\r\nperhaps jointly. These concessions are personal, and may not be sold or\r\ntransferred without the governor-general’s consent. The use of divers,\r\nmachinery, dredges, and other apparatus, and the building of necessary\r\nstations are allowed, if there be no interference with navigation,\r\nfishing, or coast travel. An annual tax is to be paid, with a stated\r\nincrease each year, and revised according to the success of the\r\nenterprise. A report must be sent yearly to the governor-general. The\r\ngrants may be revoked if work is not begun within a stated period; if\r\nthe work is needlessly abandoned during one year, or if the tax is not\r\npaid. Whenever the interests of the colony or of the public service\r\nrequire it, the privilege may be withdrawn without indemnity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n\r\n                        EUROPEAN PEARL FISHERIES\r\n\r\n               THE BRITISH ISLES, THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VIII\r\n                  PEARL FISHERIES OF THE BRITISH ISLES\r\n\r\n\r\n      And Britain’s ancient shores great pearls produce.\r\n\r\n                                          MARBODUS (_circa_ 1070).\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of pearls in the British Isles was known two thousand\r\nyears ago, and frequent references to them were made in Roman writings\r\nof the first and second centuries of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nIn his “Lives of the Cæsars,” the biographer Suetonius, after speaking\r\nof the admiration which Julius Cæsar had for pearls, states that their\r\noccurrence in Britain was an important factor in inducing the first\r\nRoman invasion of that country in 55 B.C.[184] If this be true, the\r\nEnglish-speaking people owe a vast debt of gratitude to these pearls in\r\nbringing their Briton ancestors in contact with Roman civilization; and\r\nthe influence which they have thus exercised on the world’s history has\r\nbeen greater than that of the pearls from all other regions or, we might\r\nadd, than all other jewels.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist Pliny (23–79) stated: “In Brittaine it is certain that\r\nsome do grow; but they bee small, dim of colour, and nothing orient. For\r\nJulius Cæsar (late Emperor of famous memorie) doth not dissimble, that\r\nthe cuirace or breastplate which he dedicated to Venus mother within her\r\ntemple was made of English pearles.”[185]\r\n\r\nThis decoration of pearls was a very proper offering to the goddess who\r\narose from the sea.\r\n\r\nThe historian Tacitus noted in “Vita Agricolæ” that the pearls from\r\nBritain were dusky or brownish (_subfusca ac liventia_).[186] In his\r\ncommentaries on the Gospel of Matthew, Origen (185–253), one of the\r\nGreek fathers of the church, described the British pearls as next in\r\nvalue to the Indian. Their surface, he stated, was of a golden color,\r\nbut they were cloudy and less transparent than those from India.\r\n\r\nWe have no certain information whether the pearls secured by the Romans\r\nwere from the edible mussel (_Mytilus edulis_) of the sea-coast or from\r\nthe Unios of the fresh-water streams. Tacitus’s statement that they were\r\ncollected “as the sea throws them up,” seems to locate them on the\r\nsea-coast; but conditions in modern times make it appear more probable\r\nthat they were from the fresh waters.\r\n\r\nSome of the very early coins of the country indicate that pearls were\r\nused to ornament the imperial diadem of the sovereigns of ancient\r\nBritain. In “Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum,” the celebrated\r\nEnglish monk, Bede (673–735) surnamed “The Venerable,” enumerated among\r\nother things for which Britain was famous in his day, “many sorts of\r\nshell-fish, among which are mussels, in which are often found excellent\r\npearls of all colours; red, purple, violet and green, but mostly\r\nwhite.”[187] And Marbodus, Bishop of Rennes, in his lapidarium, written\r\nabout 1070, refers to the British pearls as equaling those of Persia and\r\nIndia. About 1094 a present of an Irish pearl was made to Anselm,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, by Gilbert, Bishop of Limerick.[188]\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century there was a market for Scotch pearls in Europe,\r\nbut they were less valued than those from the Orient.[189] An ordinance\r\nof John II, King of France, in August, 1355, which confirmed the old\r\nstatutes and privileges of goldsmiths and jewelers, expressly forbade\r\nmounting Scotch and oriental pearls together in the same article, except\r\nin ecclesiastical jewelry (Orfèvre ne peut mettre en œuvre d’or ne\r\nargent parles d’Ecosse avec parles d’orient se ce n’est en grands\r\njoyaulx d’église).[190]\r\n\r\nWriting in the sixteenth century, the historian William Camden\r\n(1551–1623) stated in his “Britannia”:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OLD PRINT SHOWING FOUR METHODS OF CATCHING PEARL-BEARING MOLLUSKS\r\n\r\n  Reproduced from “Margaritologia, sive Dissertatio de Margaritis,” by\r\n    Malachias Geiger, Monachii, 1637\r\n]\r\n\r\n  The British and Irish Pearls are found in a large black Muscle....\r\n  They are peculiar to rapid and stony rivers; and are common in\r\n  Wales, and in the North of England, and in Scotland, and some parts\r\n  of Ireland. In this country they are called by the vulgar _Kregin\r\n  Diliw_, i.e. Deluge shells; as if Nature had not intended the shells\r\n  for the rivers; but being brought thither by the Universal Deluge,\r\n  they had continued there, and so propagated their kind ever since.\r\n  Those who fish here for Pearls, know partly by the outside of these\r\n  Muscles, whether they contain any; for generally such as have them\r\n  are a little contracted or distorted from their usual shape. A\r\n  curious and accomplished Gentleman, lately of these parts, showed me\r\n  a valuable Collection of the Pearls of the Conway River in Wales;\r\n  amongst which I noted a stool-pearl [button-pearl], weighing\r\n  seventeen grains, and distinguished on the convex side with a fair\r\n  round spot of a Cornelian colour, exactly in the center.[191]\r\n\r\nIn 1560 “large handsome pearls” were sent from Scotland to Antwerp.[192]\r\nIn 1620 a great pearl was found in the Kellie Burn, in Aberdeenshire.\r\nThis was carried to King James by the provost, who was rewarded with\r\n“twelve to fourdeen chalder of victuals about Dunfermline, and the\r\nCustoms of Merchants’ goods in Aberdeen during his life.” No record\r\nappears of the reward paid to the finder; possibly it was not worth\r\nrecording.\r\n\r\nIn 1621 the Privy Council of Scotland issued a proclamation that pearls\r\nfound within the realm belonged to the Crown; and conservators of the\r\npearl fisheries were appointed in several of the counties, including\r\nAberdeen, Ross, and Sutherland. It was the duty of the conservators,\r\namong other things, to nominate experts to fish for pearls during July\r\nand August, “when they are at chief perfection.” The conservators and\r\nfishermen were compensated by selling those pearls of ordinary quality,\r\nbut “the best for bignesse and colour” were to be remitted to the king.\r\nIt was reported to the Privy Council that the conservator in\r\nAberdeenshire did very well in the first year. “He hath not only taken\r\ndivers pearls of good value, but hath found some in waters where none\r\nwere expected.” The first parliament of Charles I abolished these\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nRobert Sibbald, physician to Charles II, wrote that he had seen a\r\nnecklace of Scotch pearls which was valued at two thousand crowns; they\r\nwere “larger than peas, perfectly round, and of a brilliant\r\nwhiteness.”[193]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Sir Richard Wynne of Gwydir presented to Catherine of\r\nBraganza, queen of Charles II of England, a pearl from the Conway in\r\nWales, which is said to be even yet retained in the royal crown. In his\r\n“Faerie Queene” (1590), Spenser speaks of the\r\n\r\n              Conway, which out of his streame doth send\r\n              Plenty of pearles to deck his dames withal.\r\n\r\nThe White Cart River in Scotland, on which the city of Paisley is\r\nsituated, was distinguished, according to Camden, “for the largeness and\r\nthe fineness of the Pearls that are frequently found hereabouts and\r\nthree miles above.”[194] And the pearls from Irton in Cumberland,\r\nEngland, were so noted at that time that “fair as Irton pearls” became a\r\nbyword in the north country. In their history of Westmoreland and\r\nCumberland,[195] Nicolson and Burn state that “Mr. Thomas Patrickson,\r\nlate of How of this county (Cumberland), having employed divers poor\r\ninhabitants to gather these pearls, obtained such a quantity as he sold\r\nto the jewellers in London for above £800.” But in 1794 Hutchinson[196]\r\nstated that none had been seen for many years past.\r\n\r\nPearl fishing in Ireland was of some consequence in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Speaking of the Slaney River, Solomon Richards, in a\r\ndescription of Wexford about the year 1656, said: “It ought to precede\r\nall the rivers in Ireland for its pearle fishing, which though not\r\nabundant are yet excellent, for muscles are daily taken out of it about\r\nfowre, five and six inches long, in which are often found pearles, for\r\nlustre, magnitude and rotundity not inferior to oriental or any other in\r\nthe world.”[197] In 1693 Sir Robert Redding wrote that there were four\r\nrivers in the county of Tyrone in northern Ireland which abounded in\r\npearl-mussels, all four emptying into Lough Foyle and thence into the\r\nsea. They were also to be found in several rivers in the adjacent\r\nDonegal County. Redding gave an interesting description of the fishery:\r\n\r\n  In the warm months before harvest is ripe, whilst the rivers are low\r\n  and clear, the poor people go into the water and take them up, some\r\n  with their toes, some with wooden tongs, and some by putting a\r\n  sharpened stick into the opening of the shell; and although by\r\n  common estimate not above one shell in a hundred may have a pearl,\r\n  and of these pearls not above one in a hundred be tolerably clear,\r\n  yet a vast number of fair merchantable pearls, and too good for the\r\n  apothecary, are offered to sale by those people every summer assize.\r\n  Some gentlemen of the country make good advantage thereof, and I\r\n  myself, whilst there, saw a pearl bought for £2, 10s. that weighed\r\n  36 carats, and was valued at £40, and had it been as clear as some\r\n  others produced therewith it would certainly have been very\r\n  valuable. Everybody abounds with stories of the good pennyworths of\r\n  the country, but I will add but one more. A miller took a pearl,\r\n  which he sold for £4, 10s. to a man that sold it for £10 to another,\r\n  who sold it to the late Lady Glenanly for £30, with whom I saw it in\r\n  a necklace; she refused £80 for it from the late Duchess of Ormond.\r\n\r\n  The young muscles never have any pearl in them. The shells that have\r\n  the best pearls are wrinkled, twisted, or bunched, and not smooth\r\n  and equal, as those that have none. And the crafty fellows will\r\n  guess so well by the shell, that though you watch them never so\r\n  carefully, they will open such shells under the water, and put the\r\n  pearls in their mouths, or otherwise conceal them. Yet sometimes\r\n  when they have been taking up shells, and believing by such signs as\r\n  I have mentioned, that they were sure of good purchase, and refused\r\n  good sums for their shares, they found no pearl at all in them. Upon\r\n  discourse with an old man that had been long at this trade, he\r\n  advised me to seek not only when the waters were low, but on a\r\n  dusky, gloomy day also, lest, said he, the fish see you, for then he\r\n  will shed his pearl in the sand; of which I believe no more than\r\n  that some muscles have voided their pearls, and such are often found\r\n  in the sands.[198]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  MADAME NORISCHKINE DUCHESSE ELIZABETH DAUGHTER OF GENERAL SOBELIEFF\r\n    NÉE STRAUDMAN       (CONSTANTIN)     FIRST COUNTESS BEAUHARNAIS\r\n\r\nFor several years following 1760, the Scotch pearl fisheries were of\r\nconsiderable local value. The zoölogist, Thomas Pennant, wrote of them\r\nseveral times in his “Tour of Scotland.” Referring to the Tay and Isla\r\nrivers, then as now the center of the Scotch pearling, he states: “There\r\nhas been in these parts a very great fishery of pearl, got out of the\r\nfresh-water muscles. From the year 1761 to 1764, £10,000 worth were sent\r\nto London, and sold from 10s. to £1 6s. per ounce. I was told that a\r\npearl had been taken there that weighed 33 grains. But this fishery is\r\nat present exhausted, from the avarice of the undertakers. It once\r\nextended as far as Loch Tay.”[199] And he adds later that, some years\r\npreceding, a pearl fishery was prosecuted in Loch Dochart with great\r\nsuccess and the pearls were esteemed the fairest and largest of any.\r\n\r\nFrom 1770 to 1860 the pearl resources of Scotland remained almost\r\ndormant, and Scotch pearls were rarely met with in the markets. In 1861\r\na German merchant, who was acquainted with the beauty of these gems,\r\ntraveled through the districts of Tay, Doon and Don, obtaining a great\r\nnumber which the poor people kept for their own pleasure, not esteeming\r\nthem of any market value, and interested the fishermen in searching for\r\nthe mussels. The seemingly high prices which he paid and the abundance\r\nof the pearls sent hundreds of persons to the rivers and small brooks.\r\nThose who were otherwise employed during the day devoted hours of the\r\nlong summer nights to diligent search after the coveted shells; while\r\nboys and old persons, who were without regular avocations, waded day\r\nafter day where there was a probability of reward. In the course of a\r\nshort time pearls, good, bad and indifferent, reached the originator of\r\nthe movement at Edinburgh, from Ayrshire, from Perthshire, and from the\r\nHighland regions far beyond the Grampians. He was soon the possessor of\r\na collection which, for richness and variety, had seldom been surpassed.\r\nA trade in these gems was developed, the patronage of royalty was\r\nobtained, and once more Scotch pearls became fashionable, and their\r\nvogue was enhanced by the fondness which Queen Victoria entertained for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the rivers named, pearls were found in the Forth, the\r\nTeith, the Ythan, and the Spey in eastern Scotland. The summer of 1862\r\nwas most favorable for pearling, owing to the dryness of the season and\r\nthe low water, and unusually large quantities of pearls were found, the\r\nprices ranging ordinarily from 10s. to £2 6s. Queen Victoria is said to\r\nhave purchased one for forty guineas; others were bought by Empress\r\nEugénie and by the Duchess of Hamilton. A necklace of them was sold for\r\n£350 in 1863.[200] The value of the entire catch in Scotland in 1864 was\r\nestimated at £12,000 to the fishermen, the yield being unusually large\r\nin that season owing to the unprecedented drought which permitted access\r\nto the deep beds of the rivers. In some of the streams the resources\r\nwere quickly depleted, but in others the fisheries yielded profitable\r\nreturns for many years. While most of the pearls were small, some of\r\nthem were choice and of considerable individual value, ranging from £5\r\nto £150, and £500 is said to have been paid for one fine specimen.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-mussel of the British Isles (_Unio margaritifera_) has a\r\nthick, coarse and unsightly shell, from 3 to 7 inches in width and 1½ to\r\n2½ inches in length from the umbo to the lip. The rough exterior is dark\r\nbrown, and it is sometimes twisted, distorted and barnacled.\r\n\r\nIt generally lies scattered and detached over the pebbly bottoms, but it\r\nalso exists in reefs or beds which are sometimes of considerable extent.\r\nThese occur usually where a stretch of water is still and deep, and\r\noftentimes where the depth places the mussels beyond the reach of the\r\nfishermen. Apart from the pearls it contains, the mussel is of no\r\neconomic value except that in some localities the mollusk is used for\r\nbait in cod-fishing.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the pearl-mussel has been numerous in several of the\r\nrivers of Scotland, such as the Tay, Earn, and Teith in Perthshire; the\r\nDee, the Don, and the Ythan in Aberdeenshire; the Spey and Findhorn in\r\nInverness-shire, and also the classic Doon of Burns, the Nith, the Annan\r\nand others in southern Scotland; however, it is rare in the Clyde and\r\nthe Tweed.\r\n\r\nThe Teith has long been famed for pearl-bearing, though like other\r\nrivers it has become nearly fished out. The Tay produces many pearls,\r\nyet as a rule they are not of the best class. Some of its tributaries,\r\nas the Tummel and the Isla, also bear pearls; those in the Isla are\r\nusually fine and rank higher than those from the Tay. The Earn is also\r\nfamous for the fine quality of its pearls, but the whole river was\r\nrobbed of its wealth some years ago by a body of professional fishermen,\r\nand it has not yet recovered from the raid; few pearls now exist there\r\nsave in the deeper pools, where doubtless may still be hid “full many a\r\ngem of purest ray serene.”\r\n\r\nIn Ireland pearls have been found principally in the rivers of counties\r\nKerry, Donegal, Tyrone, Antrum, etc. In an article in “The Field,”\r\nDecember 10, 1864, Mr. F. T. Buckland stated that they abound near\r\nOughterard, and that a man called “Jemmy the Pearl-catcher,” who lived\r\nthere, told him that he knew when a mussel had a pearl in it even\r\nwithout opening the shell, because “she [the mussel] sits upright with\r\nher mouth in the mud, and her back is crooked,” that is, corrugated like\r\na ram’s horn. Pearls are yet found in several localities in the Emerald\r\nIsle, notably in the river Bann in the northeastern part and in the\r\nbeautiful Connemara district in western Ireland. In 1892 the Bann\r\nyielded one of the choicest pearls that ever came from Ireland. Within\r\nthe last twelve months Lady Dudley, wife of the Viceroy of Ireland,\r\npresented to Queen Alexandra a number of pearls from the Connemara.\r\nThese were mounted in a green enameled brooch, and excited so much\r\nadmiration that an active demand for similar gems quickly developed in\r\nCounty Galway.\r\n\r\nMr. D. MacGregor, a well-known jeweler of Perth, to whom we are indebted\r\nfor much information relative to pearls in Scotland, states that no\r\nattention whatever is given to conserving the mussel; on the contrary,\r\nthe waters are unscrupulously despoiled by the greedy pearl fisherman\r\nwho destroys all that he finds, since, by chance, they may yield the\r\ncoveted gem. Immense numbers are thus wantonly destroyed, which if\r\nallowed to grow and propagate would be more likely to contribute to the\r\npearl yield, as it is well known that it is the aged mussels in which a\r\npearl is most likely to be found. There is no close time, and so\r\nextensive have been the raids upon the mussels in recent years that they\r\nhave been rapidly exterminated in places accessible to the fishermen;\r\nand should the spoliation continue and extend to the deep waters, the\r\npearl-mussel may soon become extinct.\r\n\r\nPearl fishing is not prosecuted throughout the year, as it can be\r\ncarried on only in the dry season when the waters are low. There are a\r\nnumber of professional fishermen who search in their favorite streams,\r\nand sometimes very profitably, as much as £200 having been gained in a\r\nsingle season by one fisherman. One of the most noted of these was\r\n“Pearl Johnnie,” who a few years ago hailed from Compar-Angus, in\r\nPerthshire, and who styled himself “Pearl Fisher to the Prince of\r\nWales,” by reason of some dealings he once had with his Royal Highness.\r\nHe was very successful in his experience of more than thirty years.\r\nThere is little mystery in the search; skill does not always avail, and\r\nmen, women and children are rewarded or disappointed indiscriminately.\r\nThe bed of the stream is searched until the patches of mussels are\r\ndiscovered, and this is usually the most tedious part of the work. These\r\nmay be in very shoal water, where a small boy has only to wade with\r\nwater above his knees and pick up the mussels by stooping; but more\r\nfrequently the water covers a man’s hips, and at times he is immersed\r\nalmost to the shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of a pearl fisherman is simple. If he wades, he commonly\r\nwears long boots with tops reaching to his breast. Provided with a pole\r\nfive or six feet long having a cleft at the lower end, and with a tube\r\nseveral inches in diameter with the lower end closed by a glass, he\r\ninvades the home of the pearl-mussel. Thrusting the tube or water glass\r\nbeneath the surface, he scans the bed of the stream, and when a mussel\r\nis sighted, the cleft pole is brought into use and it is picked up by\r\nmeans of these primitive tongs. Owing to the close resemblance which the\r\npearl-mussel bears to the stones in the riverbed, good eyesight is\r\nrequired to avoid overlooking it. A bag by the fisher’s side receives\r\nthe catch; and when this is well filled, he goes to the bank of the\r\nstream and opens his lottery, in the great majority of cases to find\r\nthat he has drawn a blank.\r\n\r\nA boat is seldom used, simply because it is not available, but in the\r\ntidal waters it is indispensable. The “box” is a risky device for\r\nfishing in the deeper waters. It is a small contrivance, somewhat like\r\nthe ancient British coracle, in which the fisherman sits or lies over on\r\nhis chest; venturing out in the deeper parts which can not be waded, he\r\ncarefully peers through the tube and draws up his find with the long\r\ncleft stick. This is a tiresome method, but some places can not be\r\nreadily fished in any other manner.\r\n\r\nIn Aberdeenshire, Perthshire, etc., there are a few men who regularly\r\nspend the season “at the pearls.” The knowing ones dispose of their best\r\nfinds to wealthy residents or to strangers and tourists who frequent the\r\nvicinity. In addition to these experienced fishermen, many of the idlers\r\nand unemployed about the riverside towns, and also the farm servants in\r\nthe country, search the waters in their neighborhood in the hope of\r\npicking up some gems. But very often it is severe and disappointing\r\nlabor, for the pearl-seeker may travel far and endure privation and\r\nhardships for days, and yet, after destroying hundreds and even\r\nthousands of mussels, he may be rewarded with only a little almost\r\nworthless dross; but again and again he returns to the elusive game,\r\ninspired by the “hope which springs eternal in the human breast.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The Valley of the Tay\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The River Earn\r\n\r\n  Photographs by The Raeburn Portrait Studio, Perth, Scotland\r\n\r\n  SCOTCH PEARL RIVERS\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe British pearls are in great variety of colors, but most of them are\r\npractically valueless on account of the absence of orient or luster; for\r\none possessing the white pearly luster, fifty may be found of a dull\r\ncolor and devoid of value. Many of these opaque pearls are dark,\r\nlusterless brown, and handfuls of them sell for only a few shillings. A\r\nlarge percentage are of a grayish or milky color, or of a bluish white\r\ntinge; these seldom attain much value unless aided by excellence of\r\nshape and purity of skin. A few are of a dark, fiery tint and of great\r\nluster. Sometimes the pearl is of a beautiful pink tint, sometimes of a\r\nlight violet, or other exquisite shade. The fine pink ones are very rare\r\nand are highly prized. The best are those having the sweet, pure white\r\nlight which constitutes the inimitable loveliness of a pearl; but few of\r\nthem are found even in the most favorable seasons, and usually these are\r\nfrom the streams in the northeastern counties and some of the streams in\r\nthe southwest. Very few combine the qualities of perfection in shape and\r\nluster; and the product of many seasons might be examined in vain to\r\nfurnish enough pearls to make a well-matched necklace of gems weighing\r\nfrom five to ten grains each. But occasionally beautiful specimens are\r\ndiscovered, weighing fifteen or twenty grains or more. One found in\r\nAberdeenshire a few years ago, perfect in shape and luster, weighed\r\ntwenty-five grains, and sold at first hand for £50. Another one, found\r\nat the confluence of the Almond and the Tay in 1865, weighed thirty\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nWhile most of these pearls are sold to jewelers in Edinburgh, Aberdeen,\r\nInverness, Perth, and other towns, many of the finest specimens have\r\ngone into the possession of prominent Scotch and English families, who\r\nhave a fancy for collecting them. Queen Victoria possessed a fine\r\ncollection of Scotch pearls, choice specimens of many years’ search,\r\nobtained almost exclusively from the Aberdeenshire waters which murmur\r\nround her beautiful Highland home. In 1907, a Scotch pearl was sold in\r\nPerth for the sum of £80; this was of a good luster with a bluish tint,\r\nit was spherical, measured seven sixteenths of an inch in diameter, and\r\nweighed twenty-one grains.\r\n\r\nThe falling off in the yield of pearls in some streams is credited to a\r\ncertain extent to the building of bridges and the consequent abandonment\r\nof fords. This is based on the theory that injury to the mollusk has\r\nsomething to do with the production of pearls, and that they are to be\r\nfound more plentiful about fords and places where cattle drink. The\r\ntheory is beautifully stated by the lamented Hugh Miller: “I found\r\noccasion to conclude that the Unio of our river-fords secretes pearls so\r\nmuch more frequently than the Unionidae and Anadonta of our still pools\r\nand lakes, not from any specific peculiarity in the constitution of the\r\ncreature, but from the effects of the habitat which it chooses. It\r\nreceives in the fords and shallows of a rapid river many a rough blow\r\nfrom the sticks and pebbles carried down in time of flood, and\r\noccasionally from the feet of men and animals that cross the stream\r\nduring droughts, and the blows induce the morbid secretions, of which\r\npearls are the result. There seems to exist no inherent cause why\r\n_Anadon cygnea_, with its beautiful silvery nacre—as bright often, and\r\nalways more delicate, than that of _Unio margaritiferus_—should not be\r\nequally productive of pearls; but secure from violence in its still\r\npools and lakes, and unexposed to the circumstances that provoke\r\nabnormal secretions, it does not produce a single pearl for every\r\nhundred that are ripened into value and beauty by the exposed,\r\ncurrent-tossed Unionidae of our rapid mountain rivers. Would that\r\nhardship and suffering bore always in a creature of a greatly higher\r\nfamily similar results, and that the hard buffets dealt him by fortune\r\nin the rough stream of life could be transmitted, by some blessed\r\ninternal pre-disposition of his nature, into pearls of great\r\nprice.”[201]\r\n\r\nThe small blue mussel (_Mytilus edulis_) of the British seas yields\r\nopaque pearls of a deep blue color, but most of them are more or less\r\nwhite in some part. Sometimes a shell is found in which a blue pearl\r\nwill be adhering to the blue lip of the shell while a dull white one\r\nadheres to the white portion of the shell. These pearls are commonly\r\nflattened on one side, doubtless where they have been adjacent to the\r\nshell. None of them is of more than very slight value.\r\n\r\nProbably the principal fishery for the salt-water mussel pearls is that\r\nin the estuary of the Conway in Wales. These are mostly quite small and\r\nwell answer the designation of seed-pearls, although a few are of fair\r\nsize. In color most of them range from dirty white to the dusky or\r\nbrownish tint noted by Tacitus eighteen centuries ago, but a few are of\r\na pure silvery tint. In some seasons London dealers have agents at\r\nConway for purchasing these pearls. The price is usually from eight to\r\nthirty shillings per ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE\r\n\r\n  Après l’esprit de discernement, ce qu’il y a au monde de plus rare,\r\n  ce sont les diamants et les perles.\r\n\r\n                                         LA BRUYÈRE, _Les caractères_.\r\n\r\nPearls occur in species of mussels found in the streams and lakes of\r\nEurope, in some of which the fisheries have been of considerable local\r\ninterest. It appears that these resources were exploited by the Romans,\r\nthen by the Goths and the Lombards, and later the natives continued to\r\ndraw forth the treasures which lay hidden about their homes. These\r\npearls have attracted attention up to the present time; and while they\r\ndo not compare with those of the seas, either in quality or in aggregate\r\nvalue, yet they are prized on account of their intrinsic worth as well\r\nas because they are a product of the fatherland. In the densely\r\npopulated valleys, the rivers are so polluted by refuse and sewage that\r\nthe mollusks have been greatly depleted; but in the streams of clear,\r\ncool water, draining the mountain regions of France, Germany, Austria,\r\nand also in the rivers of Norway, Sweden, Russia, etc., the fisheries\r\nare not unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of the pearl fisheries in France are those of the\r\nVologne, a small river in the extreme eastern part of the country, in\r\nthe department of Vosges. Its sources are in Lake Longmere in the Vosges\r\nmountains on the Alsace frontier, and it flows into the Moselle at\r\nJarmenil, between Remiremont and Épinal. While the pearl-mussel occurs\r\nto some extent in nearly the whole length of this river, and, indeed, is\r\nto be met with in the wild brooks and forest streams of nearly all the\r\nmountainous parts of France, it is most abundant in the vicinity of\r\nBruyères, where the Vologne receives the waters of the Neuré. These\r\nresources were described in 1845 by Ernest Puton,[202] and in 1869 by D.\r\nA. Godron;[203] to whom—and especially to Godron—we are indebted for\r\nmuch of our information.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries of the Vologne have been celebrated for nearly four\r\ncenturies. Writing in 1530, Volcyr stated: “In the river Vologne between\r\nArche and Bruyères, near the ancient castle of Perle, beautiful pearls\r\nare found. In the opinion of jewelers and artists they closely resemble\r\nthe oriental.”[204] A few years later Francis Reues wrote: “There is\r\nnear the Vosges mountains in Lorraine a river fertile in pearls, yet\r\nthey are not very brilliant. The strange thing is that the quality which\r\nthey lack by nature is supplied by the aid of pigeons, which swallow\r\nthem and restore them purer than before.”[205] In a publication of 1609,\r\nthis little river is represented in the frontispiece by the figure of a\r\nnymph bearing many pearls, while beneath is the emblem: _Vologna\r\nmargaritifera suas margaritas ostentat_.[206]\r\n\r\nIn his paper above noted, Godron recites several orders issued from 1616\r\nto 1619 by the Duke of Lorraine, who then had jurisdiction over the\r\npresent department of Vosges, showing that a high value was attached to\r\nthese pearls and that the resources were well looked after. Writing in\r\n1699, Dr. Martin Lister alluded to the many pearls taken from the rivers\r\nabout Lorraine and Sedan. A Paris merchant showed him a fresh-water\r\npearl of 23 grains, valued at £400, and assured him that he had seen\r\nsome weighing 60 grains each.[207]\r\n\r\nIn 1779 Durival gave an extensive account[208] of the Vologne fishery.\r\nHe records that for sixty years pearls had been abundant, but at the\r\ntime he wrote they were very scarce.\r\n\r\nPuton states that, in 1806, when taking the baths at Plombières in the\r\nVosges, Empress Josephine formed a great liking for the Vologne pearls,\r\nand at her request some of the mussels were sent to stock the ponds at\r\nMalmaison. It does not appear that any favorable result followed this\r\ntransplanting.\r\n\r\nOwing to the extensive fisheries, the mussels became so scarce that in\r\n1826, when the Duchesse d’Angoulême was visiting in the Vosges, it was\r\nimpossible to secure enough pearls to form a bracelet for her. This\r\nscarcity has continued up to the present time; and yet in the aggregate\r\nmany pearls have been secured, so that there are few prominent families\r\nin the neighborhood who do not possess some of them. They are especially\r\nprized as bridal presents to Vosges maidens.\r\n\r\nWhile the Vologne pearls are of good form and of much beauty, they do\r\nnot equal oriental pearls in luster. The color is commonly milky white,\r\nbut some of them have a pink, yellow, red, or greenish tint. In size\r\nthey rarely exceed 4 grains. The Nancy museum of natural history\r\npossesses one which weighs 5¼ grains and measures 6½ mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn western France, according to Bonnemere,[209] the pearl-mussel is\r\nwidely diffused, and in the aggregate many pearls are secured therefrom.\r\nThey are somewhat numerous in the river Ille near its union with the\r\nVilaine at Rennes; though small, these are commonly of good color and\r\nluster. In the department of Morbihan and that of Finistère, many pearls\r\nhave been secured, especially in the Steir, the Odet, and in the\r\nStang-Alla near Quimper. Small pearls, frequently of some value, are\r\nfound in the Menech near the town of Lesneven, a few miles northeast of\r\nBrest, the great naval port of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GREAT CAMEO PEARL, ACTUAL SIZE 22 INCHES\r\n\r\n  Sold at auction in Amsterdam in 1776 for 180,000 florins. Note great\r\n    baroque pearl forming body of the swan at the base, diameter 1.37\r\n    inches\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe _Unio sinuatus_ (_pictorum_), the _mulette_ of the artists, which\r\nhas a shorter and smaller shell than the pearl-mussel, has also yielded\r\nmany small pearls of good quality, as well as shells for manufacturing\r\npurposes. This species has been regularly exploited in the Adour, in the\r\nCharente, in the Gironde and its tributaries—the Garonne and the\r\nDordogne and their affluents, and in some other streams in western\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThere is a pearl fishery in the Charente River near the western coast of\r\nFrance, and likewise in the Seugne, a small tributary entering it from\r\nthe south. The mussel is known locally under the name of _palourde_. In\r\nan account of this fishery,[210] Daniel Bellet states that in the\r\nSeugne, where the water is shallow and clear, the mussel is secured by\r\nentering the pointed end of a wooden staff or stick between the valves\r\nof the open shell as the mollusk lies feeding on the bottom; as the\r\nshell is immediately closed tightly upon the intruding stick, it is\r\neasily removed from the water.\r\n\r\nIn the deeper waters of the Charente, the fishery is prosecuted on a\r\nlarger scale. Until recently, the _palourdes_ were caught by means of a\r\ndredge towed by a small boat, which was raised from time to time and the\r\ncatch removed. Ten or fifteen years ago the scaphander or diving\r\napparatus was introduced, requiring seven men for its operation, and by\r\nits use large catches have been made. The mussels are taken to the bank\r\nand there boiled for a time to cause the shells to open, so that the\r\ncontents may be easily removed.\r\n\r\nThe shells are examined one by one to find any pearls that may adhere\r\nthereto, and then the flesh of the mollusk is crushed between the\r\nfingers to locate pearls contained in the mass; this is done largely by\r\nchildren, working under competent supervision. Many pearls of fairly\r\ngood size and luster are obtained. The flesh of this mollusk is edible\r\nand well-liked in southwestern France; and the shells are also of value\r\nin the manufacture of buttons and similar objects.\r\n\r\nIn Germany the pearl fisheries are most important in streams of the\r\nsouthern districts, in Bavaria, Saxony, and Silesia. The pearl-mussel in\r\nthese waters is not so abundant as formerly; yet, owing to the care\r\nwhich has been given to these resources, it is probably as numerous here\r\nas in any other part of the continent. The mussel rarely occurs singly,\r\ngenerally in small beds or banks contiguous to each other, and in some\r\nfavorable regions these are extensive.\r\n\r\nThe pearl fisheries of Bavaria have been prominent since the sixteenth\r\ncentury. They exist principally in the districts of Upper Franconia\r\n(_Oberfranken_) and Upper Palatinate (_Oberpfalz_), the several\r\ntributaries of the Danube between Ratisbon and Passau, and in those\r\ntributaries of the Main and the Saale which rise in the Bavarian\r\nmountains, such as the Oelsnitz, the Lamnitz, Schwesnitz, Grünebach,\r\nVils, and the Perlbach; also in the district of Lower Bavaria, where in\r\nnine districts alone there are one hundred pearl-bearing streams and\r\nlakes, of which the most important are the Regen, the Isar, and the\r\nIlz.[211]\r\n\r\nEarly in the sixteenth century, the river Ilz had the reputation of\r\nyielding the choicest pearls in Lower Bavaria. The right to them was\r\nreserved to the bishop of Passau, and a decree was made in 1579 that\r\npersons convicted of poaching on these reserves should be hanged.[212]\r\nSince that time there have been few decades in which the gems have not\r\nbeen found in the woodland brooks and mountain streams that flow through\r\nthe ravines and past quaint, interesting castles of the wonderful\r\nBavarian highlands. Most of the prominent families in this beautiful\r\nregion have collections of native pearls, and there is still some trade\r\nin them in picturesque Passau, at the junction of the Danube, the Ilz\r\nand the Inn.\r\n\r\nTavernier wrote about 1670: “As for the pearls of Scotland, and those\r\nwhich are found in the rivers of Bavaria, although necklaces are made of\r\nthem which are worth up to 1000 _écus_ (£225) and beyond, they cannot\r\nenter into comparison with those of the East and West Indies.”[213]\r\n\r\nThe official returns for the Bavarian fisheries, dating from the latter\r\npart of the sixteenth century, were examined by Von Hessling in 1858. He\r\nnoted many gaps in the statements of the yearly returns, partly on\r\naccount of the loss of the records and partly because the pearls were\r\ndelivered directly into the hands of the princes. The results of the\r\nfirst fisheries are recorded in the district of Hals for the years\r\n1581–99, in Viechtach for 1581–83 and 1590–93, and in Weissenstadt and\r\nZwiesel for 1583. The range of the fisheries was enlarged through the\r\ndiscovery of new areas during the first half of the seventeenth century;\r\nbut this was offset by the bad seasons and by disturbed conditions\r\nduring the Thirty Years’ War. From 1650 to 1783 the pearls in the forest\r\nlands of the Palatinate were exploited regularly and uninterruptedly,\r\nwith the exception of the district of Wetterfeld and that of Neunburg\r\nvor dem Wald, where they were prosecuted for a few years only. From 1783\r\nto 1814, they were almost entirely neglected, and the take was confined\r\nto a few streams in Upper Palatinate and in the Bavarian forests. In the\r\nformer episcopal principality of Passau, where, according to general\r\naccounts, the waters were rich in pearls, the records were scanty\r\nprevious to 1786; this was probably owing to the fact that the head\r\ngamekeeper was obliged to transmit the catch of pearls directly to the\r\nprince-bishop. The records for the fisheries in the districts of Rehau\r\nand Kulmbach began with the year 1733.\r\n\r\nFrom these fragmentary returns—making no estimate for the years for\r\nwhich there were no figures available—Von Hessling found that from 1600\r\nto 1857 there were taken 15,326 pearls of the first class, which were\r\nclear white in color and of good luster; 27,662 pearls of the second\r\nclass, which were somewhat deficient in luster, and 251,778 pearls of\r\nthe third or poorest class, or “_Sandperlen_,” which, though of poor\r\nquality, had sufficient whiteness and luster to be used as ornaments.\r\nHad the records been complete, these figures would probably have been at\r\nleast fifty per cent. greater, or a total of about 445,000 pearls in the\r\n257 years. In the last forty-three years of this period, for which the\r\nrecords are fairly complete, the annual average was 208 pearls of the\r\nfirst, 395 of the second, and 3091 of the third class, a total each year\r\nof 3694 pearls of all grades. This was divided among the districts as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                            ANNUAL AVERAGE\r\n\r\n          District     First class Second class Third class Total\r\n      Upper Franconia           13           34          52    99\r\n      Upper Palatinate          38           77         207   322\r\n      Lower Bavaria            157          284        2832  3273\r\n                               ———          ———        ————  ————\r\n           Total               208          395        3091  3694\r\n\r\nProbably the most interesting of the pearl fisheries in Germany are\r\nthose prosecuted in the extreme southwestern part of the kingdom of\r\nSaxony, in the picturesque region known as Vogtland. This is not on\r\naccount of their extent, for the output rarely exceeds $2000 in value in\r\nany season; but because for nearly three hundred years they have been\r\nconducted with the utmost care and regard for the preservation of the\r\nresources. Indeed, a record exists of practically every pearl obtained\r\nfor nearly two centuries.\r\n\r\nThe waters in which the Saxon Vogtland fisheries are prosecuted are the\r\nElster River, from the health resort of that name to a short distance\r\nbelow Elsterberg; its tributaries, the Mülhaüser, Freiberger, and\r\nMarieneyer brooks; the Hartmannsgrüner and the Triebel brooks, the\r\nTrieb, the Meschelsgrüner, the Teil, and Loch brooks, and twenty-five or\r\nmore small ponds.\r\n\r\nFor most of the data relative to these fisheries, we are indebted\r\nto J. G. Jahn’s “Die Perlenfischerei im Voigtlande,” Oelsnitz,\r\n1854; to Hinrich Nitsche’s “Süsswasserperlen, Internationale\r\nFischerei-Ausstellung zu Berlin,” 1880, and to O. Wohlberedt’s\r\n“Nachtrag zur Molluskenfauna des Königreiches Sachsen,”\r\n“Nachrichtsblatt der deutschen Malakozoologischen Gesellschaft,”\r\nFrankfurt-am-Main, 1899, pp. 97–104.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1621, the electoral prince, Johann Georg I, reserved the\r\npearl fishery of the Vogtland in Saxony as a royal privilege, and\r\nappointed Moritz Schmerler as superintendent and fisherman. From that\r\ntime until the present, this fishery has remained a royal prerogative;\r\nand, remarkable to state, except at the close of the seventeenth century\r\nwhen the father-in-law of a Schmerler enjoyed the privilege, all the\r\nsuperintendents of the fishery—twenty-four persons in number—have been\r\ndirect descendants of the second pearler, Abraham Schmerler, who, in\r\n1643, succeeded his brother Moritz. The present superintendent Julius\r\nSchmerler has been in charge since 1889.\r\n\r\nThis fishery is conducted in accordance with regulations of the chief\r\ninspector of forests for the district of Auerbach. The present\r\nregulations date from June 15, 1827. In compliance therewith an\r\ninspection is made of the waters each spring to remove all obstructions\r\nand debris that would injure the resources; and, if necessary, entire\r\nbeds of mussels are removed from one locality to another which appears\r\nmore favorable. No mussels are opened at that time, for the real search\r\nfor pearls does not begin until the season is far advanced and the\r\nfishermen can wade up to the waist in the water without discomfort.\r\n\r\nDr. Nitsche states that the whole pearling district is not searched over\r\nevery year, but is divided into 313 sections, each one constituting a\r\nday’s work for three fishermen, and rarely are more than twenty or\r\nthirty of these fished in any one year. Thus each section or district is\r\npermitted to rest and recuperate for ten or fifteen years before it is\r\nagain invaded. Every mussel is opened carefully by hand, with the aid of\r\na peculiarly constructed iron instrument. By inserting the edge of this\r\nbetween the nibs of the shell and turning it at right angles, the valves\r\nare opened sufficiently to determine whether a pearl is contained\r\ntherein. If none is observed, the instrument is released and the mussel\r\nreturned uninjured to the water; but if a pearl is found within, the\r\nshell is forced open and the find removed. In case small pearls are\r\nobserved which give promise of growing larger in time, they are not\r\nremoved, but the year is marked upon the shell with the opening\r\nimplement and the mussel returned to the water. It often happens that\r\ngood pearls are later removed from shells marked in this manner.\r\n\r\nComplete records exist of the yield of this fishery during each year\r\nsince 1719, when the Vogtland passed to the electorate of Saxony. The\r\nfollowing is a summary of these records arranged in series of twenty\r\nyears each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n   DOWAGER CZARINA OF    GRAND DUCHESS VLADIMIR    GRAND DUCHESS MARIE\r\n         RUSSIA                                         PAVLOVNA\r\n\r\n    Years                Half\r\n               Clear     clear     Sand     Damaged             Average\r\n              pearls    pearls    pearls    pearls     Total   per year\r\n                No.       No.       No.       No.       No.       No.\r\n\r\n 1720–1739       1,809       727     1,201       552     4,289       214\r\n\r\n 1740–1759       1,412       578       484       281     2,755       138\r\n\r\n 1760–1779       1,042       272       427       219     1,960        98\r\n\r\n 1780–1799       1,261       243       357       179     2,040       102\r\n\r\n 1800–1819       1,603       261       325       203     2,392       120\r\n\r\n 1820–1839       1,659       340       326       326     2,651       133\r\n\r\n 1840–1859       1,884       610       387       505     3,386       169\r\n\r\n 1860–1879       1,618       682       450       514     3,264       163\r\n\r\n 1880–1899         471       394        86       373     1,324        66\r\n\r\n 1900–1905          79       161        22        86       348        58\r\n\r\n                ——————     —————     —————     —————    ——————       ———\r\n\r\n Total in\r\n   186 years    12,838     4,268     4,065     3,238    24,409\r\n\r\n Average per\r\n   year             69        23        22        17       131\r\n\r\nIn recent years the development of manufacturing industries in Saxony\r\nand the resultant pollution of the water has greatly reduced the\r\nabundance of the mollusks and consequently the output has been much\r\nrestricted. The average annual yield in the twenty years ending in 1879\r\nwas 163 pearls; in the twenty years ending in 1899 it was 66 pearls, and\r\nin the six years ending in 1905 the annual average was 58 pearls. Owing\r\nto high water, there was no fishing in 1888; and with a view to\r\npermitting the resources to recuperate, the fishery was suspended from\r\n1896 to 1899, inclusive. Omitting these five years, the average yield\r\nduring each season in the two decades ending 1899 was 88 pearls.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each season, the pearls secured are turned over to the\r\ndirector of forestry for the district of Auerbach; by him they were\r\nformerly sent to the royal cabinet of natural history, or to the royal\r\ncollection at Dresden, but since 1830 they have been sent to the royal\r\nminister of finance, by whom they are sold each year. The total proceeds\r\nfrom these sales now amount to about 55,000 marks.\r\n\r\nIn former times, according to Dr. Nitsche, it was customary to use these\r\npearls in making royal ornaments. This was the origin of the famous\r\nElster necklace, consisting of 177 pearls, now in the art collection in\r\nthe Grüne Gewölbe in the palace at Dresden. Another assortment in that\r\ncollection consists of nine choice, well-matched pearls, weighing 140\r\ngrains. For a necklace of Saxon pearls, the property of a duchess of\r\nSachsen-Zeitz, the sum of 40,000 thalers ($28,400) is said to have been\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nIn Prussian Silesia the pearl-mussel is found in the upper tributaries\r\nof the Oder, especially in Bober River from Löwenberg to the sources\r\namong the foot-hills of the beautiful Riesengebirge, in the Lusatian\r\nNeisse to Görlitz, the Queiss above Marklissa, and in the Juppel as far\r\nas Weidenau. The Queiss has been famous for its pearls since the\r\nsixteenth century, and even yet specimens of great beauty are obtained\r\ntherefrom. As long ago as 1690, Ledel complained of the diminution of\r\nthe number of mollusks owing to their wilful destruction by children;\r\nand in 1729 the government issued a rescript in Upper Lusatia\r\n(_Oberlausitz_) recommending the care of the young mollusks.[214]\r\n\r\nPearls are also found in the White Main a short distance from its\r\nsource, in the head waters of the Saale, and in numerous other\r\nmountain-draining streams of middle Germany. Indeed, references could be\r\nmade to the discovery of pearls in nearly every stream of Germany at\r\nsome time during the last three or four centuries.\r\n\r\nThe records of pearl fisheries in the province of Hanover were traced by\r\nVon Hessling as far back as the sixteenth century, when they were\r\nprosecuted in the Aller, Ovia or Om, Lua or Low, and in the Seva in the\r\ndistrict of Lüneburg. During the reign of Christian Ludwig (1641–65) and\r\nin that of George William (1666–1705), pearl fishing was carried on by\r\nthe state, and old records of the former district of Bodenteich note the\r\ncustoms and practices of that period and of earlier times, and the\r\nimplements employed. In 1706, for instance, 265 clear and 292 imperfect\r\npearls were taken by three official fishermen from the Gerdauerbach.\r\nGradually, however, owing to indifferent management, the brooks yielded\r\nless and less; the government seems to have entirely abandoned\r\nsupervision of them, so that, according to Taube’s “Communication,”[215]\r\nslight results were obtained in 1766; indeed, only a few pearls could be\r\nshown as curiosities.[216]\r\n\r\nRegarding the condition of the Hanoverian pearl-brooks, especially of\r\nthose in the vicinity of Uelzen, Möbius wrote: “Uelzen lies at the\r\nconfluence of eleven small rivulets, three of which, the Wipperau, the\r\nGerdau and the Barnbeck, contain pearl-mussels. Fishing has been pursued\r\nhere for centuries, and there exists an old regulation of the sixteenth\r\ncentury in regard to the pearl fisheries in the Ilmenau. Even at the\r\npresent day, hundreds of pearls are found here which command a good\r\nprice when they are bright and of good form. These either have a silvery\r\nsheen or they are of a reddish color. The season for fishing is during\r\nthe months of July and August. The pearls are usually found in deformed\r\nshells. Their shape varies greatly; most of them are flat on one side.\r\nNaturally those which are spherical are the best, but the pear shapes\r\nare highly prized.” Möbius frequently failed to find one pearl in a\r\nhundred shells, but at other times he came across six or eight in this\r\nquantity. Most of the mussels are found in the deepest places,\r\nespecially near the banks of the streams. One end of the shell usually\r\nprojects out of the sand. The fisherman is represented as feeling about\r\nthe bottom with his feet, and when he finds a shell, he seizes it\r\nbetween his toes, picks it out, and then places it in the basket\r\nsuspended from his neck.[217]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MITER OF PATRIARCH NIKON\r\n\r\n  Presented by the Czar Alexis Mikhailovitch and the Czarina Marie\r\n    Illiinichna. Decorated largely with European fresh-water pearls. Now\r\n    in the treasury of the Patriarchs, Moscow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Baden and in Hesse are small pearl fisheries. In 1760, Elector\r\nMaximilian III sent to Mannheim, then in the Palatinate, eight hundred\r\nliving pearl-mussels from the Bavarian forests, and again in 1769, he\r\nsent four hundred mussels from Deggendorf on the Danube, so that they\r\nmight be established in the Palatinate. The mussels were placed in the\r\nSteinbach not far from Heidelberg, where they thrived so well that\r\nfishing was instituted in 1783. Soon, however, most of the mussels\r\nbecame buried in the sand, and the remainder were transplanted into a\r\nquieter portion of the Steinbach, between Kreutzsteinach and Schönau,\r\nabout five miles northeast of Heidelberg. Here they seem to have been\r\nforgotten, and were left undisturbed until, about 1820, a fine pearl\r\nvalued at two louis d’or was found near Schönau. This discovery soon led\r\nto such reckless exploitation that the government reserved the fishery\r\nas a state monopoly. The mussels were examined and sorted, and a portion\r\nof the brook was specially prepared for their reception. However, the\r\ncost of supervision was greater than the proceeds of the fishery, and\r\nthe business was rented to private parties for a very small amount. This\r\nwas paid as late as 1840 by the Natural History Society of Mannheim, the\r\nannual rate then being ten florins.\r\n\r\nAn effort was made nearly two hundred years ago to develop the pearl\r\nfisheries in Hesse. In 1717, Landgrave Prince William requested his\r\ncousin, Duke Moritz of Saxony, to send a pearl fisherman “to examine\r\nsome streams in his territory where mussels have been found and to\r\ndetermine whether they are fitted for pearl fishing and whether\r\nfisheries can be established.”[218] In the following year, a member of\r\nthe famous Schmerler family from the Saxon fisheries was sent to Cassel,\r\nbut with what result is unknown.\r\n\r\nWhen the pearling excitement developed at Schönau about 1820, Landrath\r\nWelker, of Hirschhorn on the Neckar, requested the grand duke of Hesse\r\nto place him in charge of the fishery, and when the proposition was\r\ndeclined, he formed a small company for pearl-culture. In 1828 his\r\ncompany had 558 mussels, 88 of which showed pearl formations; in 1833,\r\nout of 651, 98 contained such objects, and in 1851, 117 mussels were\r\nfound with pearl formations out of 867 examined.[219] Owing to the\r\npolicy of the company in selling the pearls only among the members\r\nthereof, the profits were altogether insufficient to cover the expenses,\r\nand gradually the fishery dwindled down until it was prosecuted only as\r\na pastime.\r\n\r\nPearls are found in the province of Schleswig-Holstein, which formerly\r\nbelonged to Denmark, but since 1866 has been a part of the kingdom of\r\nPrussia. Möbius relates that the Bavarian soldiers in 1864 collected\r\nlarge quantities of pearls from the streams of this province and sold\r\nmany of them to jewelers in Hamburg.[220] Most of them were of good form\r\nand luster; milky white was the prevailing tint, but some were pink and\r\nothers were rose-tinted.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, pearl fisheries are most important in the province of\r\nBohemia, where they are prosecuted in the headwaters of the Moldau from\r\nKrumau, a few miles above Budweis, to below Turenberg, and to a much\r\nless extent in its tributary, the Wottawa, on the northeastern slopes of\r\nthe Böhmer Wald or Bohemian Forest mountains. From very early times the\r\nright of fishery belonged to those domains and estates through which the\r\nstreams flow, as for example, the cloister of Hohenfurth, the domain of\r\nRosenberg, of Krumau, etc. The Schwarzenberg family formerly drew a\r\nconsiderable revenue therefrom. Over a hundred years ago the fishery was\r\nactively prosecuted by Count Adolph Schwarzenberg, who exhibited at the\r\nBohemian Exposition, held in Prague in 1791, an interesting collection\r\nof shells, apparatus employed in the fishery, and many beautiful pearls\r\nobtained from his domains. The fisheries of the Wottawa were noted in\r\n1560 by the Swiss naturalist Konrad von Gesner,[221] and again in 1582\r\nby the district treasurer, Wolf Huber von Purgstall. In 1679, Balbinus\r\nreferred to the excellent qualities of the pearls, estimating the value\r\nof many of them at twenty, thirty, and even one hundred golden florins\r\neach. He described the methods by which they were taken, and also\r\ncomplained of the destruction of the reefs by depredations of\r\npoachers.[222]\r\n\r\nThe Wottawa or Otawa River has long had linked with its name the epithet\r\n“the gold- and pearl-bearing brook.” Formerly, along its shores gold\r\nwashing was more or less carried on, as well as the fresh-water\r\npearl-mussel industry. At the present time, every third or fourth year,\r\nthese mussels are gathered, by means of small, fine-woven nets, from the\r\nbed of the river, and a goodly number of pearls are collected.\r\n\r\nThe reefs in the Moldau from Hohenfurth to Krumau were almost entirely\r\nruined in 1620 by the troops who were cantoned there when the Bohemian\r\nProtestants were overthrown near the beginning of the Thirty Years’ War,\r\nand they never regained the reputation they formerly enjoyed. According\r\nto the Vienna “Handels- und Börsenzeitung,” the output of the pearls\r\nfifty years ago in the upper Moldau, in the Wottawa, and in the\r\nChrudimka—a tributary of the Elbe—reached in some years the sum of one\r\nmillion florins in value, and as much as eighty and sometimes even one\r\nhundred and twenty florins were paid for an individual specimen.[223]\r\nThese pearls closely resemble those from Passau in Bavaria, and some\r\napproach the oriental gems in luster.\r\n\r\nIn the archduchy of Austria, pearls occur in several of the tributaries\r\nof the “beautiful blue Danube.” They are especially important in streams\r\nwithin the former district of Schärding, such as the Ludhammerbach, the\r\nRanzenbergerbach, the Glatzbachenbach, the Brambach, the\r\nSchwarzbergerbach, the Mosenbach, and the Hollenbach; those in the\r\nformer district of Waizkirchen, including the Pirningerbach, the\r\nKesselbach, and many of their tributary brooks, and the Michel, the\r\nTaglinsbach, the Fixelbach, and the Haarbach, in the domain of\r\nMarbach.[224] Fishing in the Pirningerbach and the Kesselbach was\r\nprosperous about 1765, and Empress Maria Theresa received a beautiful\r\nnecklace and bracelets of the pearls therefrom. In the district of\r\nMarbach, the fishing was prosecuted as long ago as 1685 for the account\r\nof the archbishop of Passau.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary from time immemorial, the native pearls have been popular\r\nwith the Magyar women, and very many yet exist in the old Hungarian\r\njewelry worn with the national costume. A century ago there was scarcely\r\na family of local prominence which did not possess a necklace of pearls,\r\nalthough these were frequently not of choice quality or of considerable\r\nsize. With a falling off in the output of the native streams there has\r\nbeen a great increase in the quantity of choice oriental pearls\r\npurchased by the wealthy families, and some of the most costly necklaces\r\nin Europe are now owned here.\r\n\r\nIn the kingdom of Denmark no pearl fisheries are now prosecuted, but\r\nthree centuries ago the gems were taken in the Kolding Fjord in the\r\nprovince of Veile, Jutland. The great Holberg, who ranks first in Danish\r\nliterature, wrote that the governor of the castle at Kolding employed as\r\na pearl fisherman a Greenlander who had come to Denmark in 1605 or 1606,\r\nand who “had given the governor to understand that in his native land he\r\nwas accustomed to fish for pearls.” Being required to work continuously,\r\nboth winter and summer, he fell ill and died, and as no one else wished\r\nto pursue the occupation, the fishery ceased.[225]\r\n\r\nIn many of the Norwegian brooks, pearl fishing has been carried on for\r\ntwo or three centuries, and often with satisfactory results. It appears\r\nfrom ordinances dated November 10, 1691, May 14, 1707, and May 28, 1718,\r\nthat the fisheries were under special supervision as a royal prerogative\r\nof the queen of Denmark.[226] Jahn notes that in 1719 and in 1722, Saxon\r\npearl fishermen were sent for. In 1734 Charles VI of Denmark requested\r\nthe elector of Saxony to send one of the pearl fishermen of Vogtland to\r\nexamine the brooks of Norway in reference to the pearl resources, and to\r\ndetermine the practicability of establishing fisheries there. In\r\nresponse to this request, C. H. Schmerler was sent to Copenhagen and\r\nthence to Christiania, where he began an investigation of the Norwegian\r\nwaters, the governor himself attending at the beginning of the work. So\r\ngreat was the estimation of its importance, that Schmerler was soon\r\nafterward received in audience by the king and queen of united Denmark\r\nand Norway at Frederiksborg palace near Copenhagen, and was awarded a\r\ngift of one hundred ducats and a life-pension.[227]\r\n\r\nIn 1751, according to Pontoppidan, Bishop of Bergen, the Norwegian pearl\r\nfisheries were placed under the jurisdiction of the diocese of\r\nChristiansand. Among the principal pearling regions at that time were\r\nthe Gon, Närim and Quasim rivers in the Stavanger district or amt; the\r\nUndol, Rosseland and other brooks in the Lister and Mandal province; and\r\nseveral streams in the district of Nadenäs.[228]\r\n\r\nThe returns from the Norwegian fisheries gradually decreased. After 1768\r\nthe rights were leased, and the revenue therefrom was paid into the\r\nroyal treasury. Owing to small returns, this source of revenue received\r\nless and less attention, and about a century ago it was altogether\r\nneglected, although from time to time choice finds were made. Due to\r\nunusually low water in 1841, a number of valuable pearls were found near\r\nJedderen in the province of Christiansand, some selling as high as $300\r\neach; several of these were shown at the London Industrial Exhibition by\r\nthe diocese of Christiania.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PANAGIA OR ORNAMENT WORN ON THE BREAST OF A BISHOP IN RUSSIA\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe pearl fisheries of Sweden were noted, nearly four centuries ago, by\r\nOlaus Magnus, Archbishop of Upsala.[229] The gems were sought for by\r\nexpert fishermen in the interior districts, and were brought in large\r\nquantities to the coasts for sale, the women and girls of all classes,\r\nrich and poor, using them extensively in personal decoration.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Linnæus left a detailed account of the method by which\r\nmussels were caught in Sweden nearly two centuries ago. He wrote: “In\r\nthe summer season, if the water is shallow, the fishermen wade in the\r\nstream and gather the mussels with their hands. Should the water be\r\ndeeper, they dive for the mussels and place such as they find in a\r\nvessel made of birch bark, which they carry with them. Sunny days are\r\nselected, because then they can see deeper into the water. But, should\r\nthis not suffice, they traverse the river on rafts which are painted\r\nwhite beneath so that the bed of the stream may be illumined by the\r\nreflected light. The men lie prone on the rafts and look down into the\r\ndepths so that they may immediately seize with wooden tongs the mussels\r\nwhich they discover. Or else, hanging by their hands to the rafts, they\r\nseize them in the water with their toes. If the water is too deep even\r\nfor this, they dive and feel around on the bottom with their hands until\r\nit becomes necessary to rise again to the surface in order to breathe.\r\nHowever, out of a hundred mussels, scarcely one contains a good pearl;\r\nbut sometimes as many as twenty pearls of the size of a grain of sand\r\nare found in one shell. Many of the larger pearls are reddish or dark,\r\nbut occasionally a beautiful white pearl is hidden under such a\r\ncovering; although, naturally, it is rare that this is altogether\r\nperfect. It has been noted that mussels seven years old contain pearls;\r\nand in each of two mussels eighteen years old, a pearl was found\r\nattached to the shell.”[230]\r\n\r\nThe list of streams in Sweden from which pearls were taken, as noted by\r\nOlaf Maimer, J. Fischerstein, and Gissler[231] a century and a half ago,\r\nseems to cover nearly all the rivers and brooks which flow from the\r\nmountains of this beautiful country.\r\n\r\nIn Russia the love for the pearl has been almost as great as in Persia\r\nand India. During the Middle Ages, pearls were worn upon the clothes of\r\nnearly all well-to-do Russians. The great head-dresses of the women were\r\nornamented with them; and they were used in decorating the stoles,\r\nvestments, crosses, and the priceless relics in the churches.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-mussel is found in very many of the Russian streams. It occurs\r\nthroughout Archangel, in most of the rivers which flow into the White\r\nSea, into Lake Ladoga, Lake Onega, and the Baltic Sea; and likewise in\r\nthe Volga watershed. Von Hessling states that east of the Volga its\r\nsouthern boundary extends to Lat. 56°, while on the west it extends\r\nfurther southward, so that in the region of the Dnieper it reaches Lat.\r\n51°. The extreme southern limit is near the mouth of the Don, about 47°\r\nnorth latitude.[232]\r\n\r\nIn northern Russia pearls are secured in the provinces of Livonia.\r\nEsthonia, and Olonetz, and in the grand duchy of Finland, where they\r\nhave been sought after for three centuries or more. Most of them are\r\nbluish gray in color and they attain a maximum weight of about twelve\r\ngrains. Although not equaling the oriental gems, these pearls are of\r\ngood quality and are highly esteemed, not only by the peasants but by\r\nthe nobility and by the royal family of Russia. For reference to most of\r\nthe historical data relative to the fishery in Livonia, we are indebted\r\nto an account written by H. Kawall.[233]\r\n\r\nSo long ago as 1612, Dionysius Fabricius compared the pearls of Livonia\r\nwith those of India. Said he: “Nor should I omit to mention that there\r\nare rivers in Livonia wherein large pearls are produced in shells; and I\r\nmyself have seen some as large as the oriental, especially when they are\r\nwell grown. But because the peasants of this region are too ignorant to\r\ndetermine with certainty when they mature, they are unable to collect\r\nthem properly, and therefore the pearls have become rarer.”[234]\r\n\r\nAccording to Mylius,[235] in the seventeenth century, when Livonia\r\nbelonged to Sweden, the pearl resources received attention from the\r\ngovernment. Charles IX of Sweden decreed October 22, 1694, that the\r\npearls therefrom should not be exported but should be sold to officers\r\nof the crown at a definite price. In 1700, an inspector of the fishery\r\nin Livonia, whose name was Krey, reported that the peasants collected\r\npearls secretly from the small rivers and brooks, and forwarded them to\r\nMoscow for sale. As the peasants objected to selling them to the king’s\r\ncommissioners at the prices fixed, the fishery soon dwindled in extent.\r\nHowever, on the annexation of Livonia to Russia in 1712, and the removal\r\nof these restrictions, it revived and became of local importance during\r\nthe last years of the reign of Peter the Great.\r\n\r\nIn 1742 the Livonian fishery was reorganized at the suggestion of a\r\nSwede named Hedenberg. Furnished by the government with funds and an\r\nescort, he began an exploration of the pearl-bearing waters, commencing\r\nwith Lake Kolk, where he secured many pearls of value, some of which\r\nwere presented to Empress Elizabeth.[236]\r\n\r\nThe fishery then came into great favor. To the nobility of Livonia, in\r\nwhose domains the brooks were situated, the crown accorded sixty rubles\r\nfor each half ounce of choice pearls secured, and for every half ounce\r\nof the second class, thirty rubles; but the nobles were obliged to\r\nrenounce their rights to the fisheries and to permit the lakes and\r\nbrooks to be guarded by imperial soldiers. Owing to the very great\r\ndestruction of mussels which yielded no pearls, a reward was offered to\r\nany one who would discover a method of determining from external\r\ncharacteristics those individual shells which contain gems of value.\r\n\r\nIn 1746, when the Empress Elizabeth passed the summer in Livonia, large\r\nquantities of pearls from the neighboring brooks were presented to her.\r\nBut, owing to the cost of supervision, the expenditures soon exceeded\r\nthe revenues and the government abandoned the guard and dismissed the\r\nfishermen. Little by little the search decreased, and by 1774 relatively\r\nfew pearls were found.[237]\r\n\r\nAccording to Hupel, the Schwarzbach River, near Werro, was celebrated\r\nfor its pearls, which were noted for their size and beauty; one of the\r\ntributaries of this river is named Perlenbach (Pearl Brook). The Ammat\r\nand Tirse streams, and forty other brooks and lakes also yielded them.\r\nPearls of slight value were likewise produced in the Palze and the\r\nRause, near Palzmar; the Paddez, a tributary of the Evest which empties\r\ninto the Düna, and the Voidau and the Petribach, each of which flows\r\ninto the Schwarzbach. Near the Tirse was a very old road house,\r\npatronized by the peasants, which from time immemorial had borne the\r\nname Pehrlu-kroghs (Pearl Tavern).\r\n\r\nFormerly some of the brooks of Esthonia on the Gulf of Finland, and\r\nprincipally those near Kolk and the adjacent lakes, furnished beautiful\r\npearls. From these waters came the beautiful necklace which is yet an\r\nheirloom in the Kolk family. The choicest of these weighed from five to\r\nten grains, and the color was grayish blue. The Emperor Alexander I is\r\nsaid to have received a present of pearls collected in the vicinity of\r\nTammerfors, in the government of Tavastehus, in the grand duchy of\r\nFinland. The development of manufacturing in that region, however, has\r\ndestroyed most of the mussels.\r\n\r\nVon Hessling notes that in the province of Olonetz, pearls are found in\r\nthe Poventshanka, in the Ostjor, and in the Kums, where they are secured\r\nby the neighboring peasants who sometimes make valuable finds.[238] When\r\nthe brooks dry up, the mussels are easily secured; old inhabitants note\r\nthat on one occasion of this kind many superb pearls were found in the\r\nPoventshanka, and a necklace of them was presented to the Empress\r\nCatherine Alexievna. These pearls rarely leave the province in which\r\nthey are collected, as the inhabitants are fond of using them for\r\npersonal decoration. Young girls attend to the fishing, and workmen\r\npierce them for about two copecks each. Choice ones sell for thirty to\r\none hundred rubles apiece.\r\n\r\nIn the government of Archangel pearls have been collected for centuries\r\nfrom the streams flowing into the White Sea and the Arctic Ocean. An\r\nextended account of the fisheries of this region was given by Von\r\nMiddendorff.[239] He states that the _Unio margaritifera_ inhabits all\r\nthe rivers in which the descent is not too rapid, and especially in the\r\nTjura, the Tuloma, the Kovda, Kereda, the Kanda, etc. The fisheries have\r\nbeen conducted exclusively by the shore Laplanders; but they have been\r\nneglected in recent years owing to the small returns. Von Hessling notes\r\nthat the pearls are dull in color; in the opinion of the fishermen this\r\nis caused by the mysterious influence of the copper money which they\r\ncarry with them. The Tuloma was formerly a productive river; its pearls\r\nwere sold in Kola, whence they were carried to Archangel, 335 miles\r\ndistant, where they were pierced by expert workmen. The Tjura also\r\nyielded many pearls; but since a Laplander was drowned while fishing for\r\nthem, a legend has spread that the spirit of the river guards the\r\npearls, and the natives hesitate about seeking them.\r\n\r\nProbably the occurrence of so many in the home streams had much to do\r\nwith developing in Russia that great love for the pearl which has made\r\nit the national ornament, all classes finding pleasure in its\r\npossession. While the superb gems treasured by the nobility are mostly\r\nfrom oriental seas, a considerable percentage of those worn by the\r\npeasantry are from the native waters. An interesting account of this\r\nfondness among a certain class of Russian women—the Jewesses of Little\r\nRussia—was given sixty years ago by the German traveler Kohl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RUSSIAN BOYARD LADIES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY, SHOWING CAPS AND\r\n    OTHER ORNAMENTS OF PEARLS\r\n]\r\n\r\n  In Alexandria, a small city in the government of Kherson in South\r\n  Russia, a Jew kept a café, and his charming daughter served us with\r\n  coffee. We paid her compliments on her beautiful eyes and teeth. But\r\n  she seemed to be much less vain of these natural ornaments than of\r\n  the acquired ones in the magnificent glittering pearl-cap which she\r\n  wore upon her head. For all the women through South and Little\r\n  Russia even as far as Galicia wear a certain stiff, baggy cap which\r\n  is very disfiguring, and is covered all over with a great number of\r\n  pearls, upon a foundation of black velvet. It is called a “mushka.”\r\n  This cap, with very unimportant modifications, has almost always the\r\n  same form; the only difference is that, in the case of the wealthy,\r\n  the pearls are larger, and sometimes a number of small pearls and\r\n  precious stones are suspended here and there, set in the same way as\r\n  the earrings of our ladies. It is common for them to wear half their\r\n  fortune on their heads in this way. For these caps generally cost\r\n  from five hundred to one thousand roubles, and many are worth five\r\n  or six thousand and even more; they wear them every day, holidays as\r\n  well as ordinary days, and strut around the kitchens and cellars\r\n  with their “mushka.” They spend their last penny in order to secure\r\n  such a pearl-cap, and even when they are clad in rags their head is\r\n  covered with pearls. In order to furnish the requisite material for\r\n  this wide-spread fashion, the commerce in pearls of Odessa, Taganrog\r\n  and some other places in southern Russia is not unimportant. There\r\n  may live in the region where the pearl-caps of which I speak are\r\n  worn at least 2,000,000 Jewesses. Let us estimate that among them\r\n  there are but 300,000 adults, and that only half of these, 150,000,\r\n  wear pearl-caps (only the most indigent and the most aristocratic do\r\n  not wear the “mushka”); let us then estimate the average value of\r\n  such a cap at only five hundred roubles—these are the lowest minima\r\n  and fall far short of the real figures—and we have a total capital\r\n  of 76,000,000 roubles, which the Jewesses of this region wear upon\r\n  their heads. Naturally the annual diminution of this capital is\r\n  small, since these pearls are transmitted from the mothers to their\r\n  daughters and granddaughters. Still, if we estimate that they last\r\n  for a century, the necessary yearly contribution amounts to nearly\r\n  one million. It is, however, probable that a much larger capital is\r\n  employed in the commerce of pearls. They are, for the most part,\r\n  oriental and come by way of Turkey and Odessa or else by way of\r\n  Armenia and Tiflis. We inquired of our beautiful Jewess whether she\r\n  was not in perpetual dread on account of her pearl-cap, and how she\r\n  protected it from thieves. She answered that she wore it on her head\r\n  all day and at night placed it in a casket which rested under her\r\n  pillow. So that the whole short life of these Jewesses of the\r\n  steppes revolves around their pearl-cap as the earth does around the\r\n  sun.[240]\r\n\r\nSeveral species of marine mollusks on the coasts of Europe yield pearly\r\nformations, but none of much ornamental or commercial value. Probably\r\nthe most interesting of these are from the Pinna on the Mediterranean\r\ncoasts, and especially on the coast of Sardinia and the shores of the\r\nAdriatic. An interesting collection of these Pinna pearls was furnished\r\nto the writers by Alexandro Castellani of Rome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n\r\n                         ISLANDS OF THE PACIFIC\r\n\r\n        SOUTH SEA ISLANDS, AUSTRALIAN COASTS, MALAY ARCHIPELAGO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   IX\r\n                PEARL FISHERIES OF THE SOUTH SEA ISLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     Sea-girt isles,\r\n             That, like to rich and various gems, inlay\r\n             The unadorned bosom of the deep.\r\n\r\n                                                   MILTON.\r\n\r\nGathering pearl shells and pearls is the principal industry of the\r\nsemi-amphibious natives of the hundreds of palm-crowned and foam-girdled\r\nislands of the southern Pacific, commonly known as the South Sea\r\nIslands. Among these the most prominent for pearl fishing are the\r\nTuamotu Islands or Low Archipelago, the Society Islands, the Marquesas,\r\nthe Fiji Islands, Penrhyn or Tongareva, and New Caledonia. These are\r\nunder the protection of the French government, except Fiji and Penrhyn,\r\nwhich belong to Great Britain.\r\n\r\nAlmost ever since the South Sea Islands have been known to civilization\r\nthey have contributed pearls; and the fishery has been one of the\r\nprincipal industries, not only for the natives, but also for the not\r\ninconsiderable number of sailors who, preferring the lotus on shore to\r\nthe salt pork and monotony of ship life, have yielded to the insular\r\nattractions and formed domestic ties. The industry has been especially\r\nextensive during the last seventy years, when there has been a\r\nprofitable market for the shells. Most of the natives—men, women, and\r\nchildren—follow it for a living. Domestic duties rest very lightly upon\r\nthe women, and many of these, and even young girls, find employment in\r\ndiving, in which at moderate depths these dusky mermaids are nearly, if\r\nnot quite as expert as the men and boys.\r\n\r\nTahiti, the largest of the eleven Society Islands, is the center of the\r\npearling industry of French Oceanica. It is situated in about Lat. 17°\r\nS. and Long. 150° W., and has an area of approximately 410 square miles\r\nand a population of 11,000, nearly one half of whom live in Papeiti, the\r\nprincipal town. This is one of the most agreeable of the “Summer Isles\r\nof Eden,” Nature furnishing food in abundance, and climate and social\r\ncustoms requiring little in the way of dress and habitation.\r\nNotwithstanding its importance as the headquarters of the pearling\r\nindustry, few pearl-oysters are caught at Tahiti, most of them coming\r\nfrom the archipelagoes of Tuamotu, Gambier, and occasionally Tubai.\r\n\r\nThe Tuamotu Archipelago is the scene of the principal pearl fisheries of\r\nthe South Seas; and from the local importance of this industry the group\r\nis sometimes called the Pearl Islands. These coral-formed islands are\r\nstrung out for a distance of 900 miles in a northwest and southeast\r\ndirection, and extend from Lat. 14° to 23° S. and from Long. 136° to\r\n149° W. They number about seventy-eight, many of them made up of small\r\natolls only a few feet above the surface of the ocean, and with an\r\naggregate area of about 360 square miles. The total population is\r\napproximately 6000, with many visitors from Tahiti and other neighboring\r\nislands during the pearling season. The principal products are pearl\r\nshell and pearls, copra, and cocoanut oil; and nearly one half of the\r\nislands yield nothing but shell and pearls. The chief port is Fakarava\r\non an island of the same name, and the trade is almost entirely with\r\nTahiti.\r\n\r\nAs the Tuamotus are of coral formation, they produce little vegetable\r\ngrowth, and the people seem often on the brink of starvation, forming a\r\nstriking contrast with those of the neighboring Society Islands. Drawing\r\ntheir subsistence entirely from the sea, except for the native cocoanuts\r\nand breadfruit, these people have, at times, been in great straits for\r\nfood, and it was doubtless severe hunger that drove them to the acts of\r\ncannibalism with which they have been charged. And the sea which\r\nsupplies them with food has also visited them with great destruction. As\r\nrecently as January, 1903, a great storm swept over this group, drowning\r\nover 500 of the inhabitants, and destroying a very considerable portion\r\nof the pearling fleet and other property.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-oyster reefs of the Tuamotu Archipelago are very extensive,\r\nonly eight or ten of the islands failing to contribute to the supply.\r\nThey occur in the protected lagoons of the atolls, where the bottom is\r\nwell covered with coral growth, with numerous elevations and depressions\r\nof various sizes; and it is about the bases and in the recesses of these\r\ncoral growths that the best shells are usually found. Most of them are\r\nof the black-edged variety of _Margaritifera margaritifera_, which here\r\nattains a great size, reaching a diameter of twelve inches in extreme\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nWhile pearl-oysters are found about nearly all of the Tuamotu Islands,\r\nthe reefs are richest at Hikueru or Melville Island. When that lagoon is\r\nopen it is the scene of the greatest operations, and it is credited with\r\nnearly one half of the total product of the archipelago. At the opening\r\nof the season, this is the resort of fishermen from all over the group,\r\neven from a distance of five hundred miles, and thousands of natives\r\ncamp in temporary leaf-thatched huts among the cocoanut-palms on the\r\nbeach, those from the different islands congregating in isolated\r\nsettlements. As many as five thousand persons are sometimes brought\r\ntogether in this way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE PEARLING REGIONS IN OCEANIA AND MALAYSIA\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe volcanic-formed Gambier Islands, with high peaks reaching, in one\r\ninstance, an altitude of over 1200 feet, present a striking contrast to\r\nthe Tuamotu atolls. This group consists of five large and several small\r\nislands, surrounded by a coral reef of an irregular triangular figure.\r\nThe 1100 inhabitants of the Gambier Islands derive a large percentage of\r\ntheir support from the pearl fishery. The patches of pearl-oysters are\r\nlocated between the islands and the barrier reefs. They are numerous\r\nabout the island of Mangareva, which is well surrounded by them on the\r\nnorth, east, and southeast. Oysters from the reef of Tearae, which\r\nextends from the eastern point of Mangareva to the small island of\r\nAukena, a distance of two miles, are especially rich in pearls. On this\r\nreef, where the water is from one to four fathoms in depth, the mollusks\r\nare small, rarely exceeding five or six inches at maturity, but the\r\nshell is very thick and coral covered; these yield many pearls. In\r\ngreater depths, the oysters attain a larger size, but they yield few\r\npearls.\r\n\r\nThe first white man to attempt the exploitation of the pearl resources\r\nof the Tuamotus appears to have been Mörenhout. In a voyage to the\r\nOceanic Islands in 1827, he learned of the great wealth of pearl shell,\r\nand applied to Queen Pomaré at Tahiti for permission to employ the\r\nnatives in the fishery. With an eye to business, she required a fee of\r\n$5000 for herself before granting the desired authority.[241]\r\nConsidering this excessive, Mörenhout attempted to deal with the natives\r\nwithout permission of the dusky queen, but under these adverse\r\nconditions he found the trade unsatisfactory and soon abandoned it.\r\n\r\nIn 1830, and the years immediately succeeding, desultory pearling\r\nvoyages were made from Valparaiso, Chile, and these were followed by\r\nexpeditions from America and elsewhere. An interesting account of the\r\ntrade at that time is contained in Lucatt’s “Rovings in the Pacific from\r\n1837 to 1849,” published in London in 1851.\r\n\r\nThe Mormon influx in 1846 resulted in a further development of the pearl\r\nfishery; and Grouard, the local leader of that denomination, is credited\r\nwith making a fortune in the business.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of the industry up to 1880, when control of the\r\nislands passed to the French government, it is estimated that about\r\n15,000 tons of pearl-oysters were secured. The extent of the fishery\r\nduring the few years preceding 1880 made such drains upon the\r\nproductiveness of the reefs that many of them gave signs of exhaustion.\r\nWith a view to adopting methods for conserving the industry, so\r\nessential to the welfare of the natives, the French Ministry of Marine\r\nand Colonies in 1883 inaugurated an investigation of its condition, and\r\nof the possibilities for improvement. This was made under the immediate\r\ndirection of G. Bouchon-Brandely, whose interesting report[242] contains\r\nmuch data on this subject.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these investigations and recommendations, a restricted\r\nseason for fishing was adopted, and only a portion of the reefs was\r\nthrown open each year, a decree of the governor, published in the\r\n“Journal Officiel” of the colony, determining the islands in which the\r\nfishery might be prosecuted. This interdiction, known locally as\r\n_rahui_, is for the purpose of permitting the oysters to develop, and\r\nthus prevent the exhaustion of the reefs.\r\n\r\nBy decree of January 24, 1885, a restriction was made against taking\r\nshells measuring less than 17 centimeters in diameter on the interior\r\nnacre, or weighing less than 200 grams per valve. But this was repealed\r\nin 1890, and since then there has been no restriction on the size of the\r\noysters that may be fished.\r\n\r\nThe pearl fishery and the isolated leper station are the principal\r\nclaims which attract the attention of the outside world to the island of\r\nPenrhyn or Tongareva, one of the Manahiki group, in Lat. 9° S., and\r\nLong. 158° W. This desolate atoll island consists of a ring of land a\r\nfew hundred yards in width, inclosing a lagoon nine miles long and five\r\nmiles wide, and it produces little else than pearls and pearl shell. The\r\nwhite gravelly shore yields little vegetation except cocoanuts, which\r\nshare with fish in furnishing sustenance to the semi-amphibious natives.\r\n\r\nAt Penrhyn the pearl fishery is carried on in the clear, limpid waters\r\nof the atoll where the oysters are undisturbed by storms. The shells\r\nbelong mostly to the golden-edged variety, and are of good quality, the\r\nvalue in London ranging from £100 to £250 per ton. Relatively few pearls\r\nare found, amounting in aggregate value to only about one fourth of the\r\nvalue of the shells. These are the principal objects of the fishery; the\r\nfinding of pearls is incidental, but careful search is always made for\r\nthem, and some choice specimens have been secured.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of New Caledonia, pearling is of recent origin, dating as\r\nan industrial enterprise from 1897, although previous to that time some\r\nshells and pearls had been secured by native beach-combers. This island\r\nis 220 miles in length and 30 in width, situated 850 miles southeast of\r\nAustralia, and about the same distance from New Zealand. It is a French\r\ncolony, and has been used by that government as a penal settlement since\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, rich beds of pearl-oysters were discovered off the west coast\r\nof this island. They are most numerous between the shore and the barrier\r\nreefs on the west coast from Pouembout River to Gomen Bay, and\r\nespecially about the small island of Konienne at the mouth of the\r\nPouembout River. They are also abundant among the Loyalty Islands off\r\nthe eastern coast of New Caledonia, and especially at the island of\r\nLifu.[243] The shell is similar to that from Torres Straits, and the\r\nyield of pearls is very large. Several concessions have been obtained to\r\nexploit these beds, one of them covering 130 miles in length. The\r\nindustry is carried on by means of scaphanders, in a manner similar to\r\nthat of Torres Straits. Virtually all of the catch is sent to France.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the South Sea Islands, and particularly of Penrhyn and\r\nthe Tuamotu group, are doubtless the most expert divers in the world.\r\nThis can be readily appreciated by those who have read of Hua Manu in C.\r\nW. Stoddard’s thrilling narrative, or have heard the story of the brown\r\nwoman who swam for forty hours in a storm with a helpless husband on her\r\nback. Accustomed to the water from infancy, these human otters swim all\r\nday long as readily as they would walk, go miles from shore without a\r\nboat in search of fish which they take by means of baited hook and line,\r\nand boldly attack a shark single-handed. Seemingly fabulous stories are\r\ntold of their descending, unaided, 150 feet or more beneath the surface,\r\nand remaining at lesser depths for nearly three minutes, far surpassing\r\nany modern records of the divers of India.\r\n\r\nThe water in the South Seas is wonderfully clear, enabling the fishermen\r\nto detect small objects at considerable depths, and especially so when\r\nusing the water-telescope, similar to that employed in the Red Sea\r\nfisheries. By immersing this to a depth of several inches and cutting\r\noff the light from the upper end as he gazes through it down into the\r\nwaters, the fisherman can readily inspect the bottom at a depth of\r\nfifteen fathoms, and thus locate the shells before he descends.\r\n\r\nThe diving is quite unlike that in Ceylon and Arabia. The men do not\r\ndescend on stones, but swim to the bottom. The diver is stripped to his\r\n_paréu_ or breech-clout, his right hand is protected by a cotton mitten\r\nor by only a wrapping of cotton cloth, and in his left hand he carries a\r\npearl shell to assist in directing his movements and in detaching the\r\noysters at the bottom. In preparing for a deep descent, he sits for\r\nseveral minutes in characteristic attitude with hands hanging over\r\nknees, and repeatedly inflates his lungs to the fullest capacity,\r\nexhaling the air slowly through his mouth. After five or six minutes of\r\n“taking the wind,” the diver inhales a good breath, drops over the\r\ngunwale into the water to give him a start, and descends feet foremost.\r\nAt a distance of twelve or fifteen feet below the surface, gracefully as\r\nan otter or a seal, he bends forward and turns head downward and, with\r\nlimbs showing dimly in frog-like motion, he swims vertically the\r\nremaining distance to the bottom. There he assumes a horizontal position\r\nand swims slowly just above the ground, searching critically for\r\nsuitable oysters, in this way traversing a distance possibly of fifty\r\nfeet or more. When he has secured an oyster, or his breath is\r\napproaching exhaustion, he springs from the ground in an erect position\r\nand rapidly swims upward, the buoyancy of his body hastening his ascent\r\nso that he pops head and shoulders above the surface, and falls back\r\nwith laboring pulse and panting breath. In case the dive has been\r\nunusually extended, a few drops of blood may trickle from the nose and\r\nmouth. His find—consisting frequently of nothing and rarely of more than\r\none oyster—is carried in a cocoanut fiber sack suspended from the neck,\r\nor is held in the left hand, or may be hugged beneath the left arm.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily in actual fishing operations, the fishermen do not descend to\r\ngreater depths than fifteen fathoms, and remain from sixty to ninety\r\nseconds. Writing in 1851, a trader who had spent several years in\r\ncollecting pearls and pearl shells among the Tuamotus stated: “I timed\r\nseveral by the watch, and the longest period I knew any of them to keep\r\nbeneath the water was a minute and a quarter, and there were only two\r\nwho accomplished this feat. Rather less than a minute was the usual\r\nduration. It is unusual for them to attempt deep diving; and let the\r\nshells be ever so abundant, they will come up and swear there are\r\nnone.”[244]\r\n\r\nHowever, in mutual contests or in special exhibitions, reports of\r\ntwenty, twenty-three, and even twenty-five fathoms are numerous, and\r\nthey have repeatedly been timed two and a half to three minutes.\r\nBouchon-Brandely speaks of a woman at Anaa, one of the Tuamotus, who\r\nwould go down twenty-five fathoms and remain three minutes under\r\nwater.[245] This seems very unusual, but there are numerous reports of\r\ntwo and a half minutes at about seventeen or eighteen fathoms. In\r\nOctober, 1899, at Hikueru Island, another of the Tuamotu group, a young\r\nnative made an exhibition dive for the officers of the United States\r\nFish Commission steamship _Albatross_. He reached bottom at a depth of\r\n102 feet under the boat’s keel, and remained submerged two minutes and\r\nforty seconds. The water was so transparent that he was clearly seen\r\nfrom the surface. After he touched bottom at that great depth, he calmly\r\npicked over the coral and shells to select a piece to bring up.[246] The\r\ndiver was ready to go down again only a few minutes after he came up.\r\n\r\nIn his work on French Oceanica, Chartier states: “There are three women\r\nwell known in the archipelago [of Tuamotu] who have no equals elsewhere;\r\nthey explore the depth at twenty-five fathoms and remain not less than\r\nthree minutes before reappearing at the surface.”[247] However, these\r\nunusual depths and extensions of time are dangerous, and care must be\r\ntaken or serious results follow. Most of the catch is obtained in about\r\nten fathoms of water.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the writer, Mr. Julius D. Dreher, American Consul at\r\nTahiti, made inquiries among the South Sea Islands in regard to the\r\nrecord of the best divers, and wrote as follows:\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. L. Young, who has lived in these islands for thirty years,\r\n  informs me that he has never seen a diver remain under water longer\r\n  than 80 seconds, and that at a depth of twelve to fifteen fathoms.\r\n  At one time he tested a man who claimed to be able to stay under for\r\n  three minutes, yet this man could hold his breath on land less than\r\n  80 seconds by the watch.\r\n\r\n  Elder Joseph F. Burton, who has spent many years as a missionary in\r\n  these islands, states that once in Hikueru, of the Tuamotu group, he\r\n  went out in a boat with the divers to time them. The best record\r\n  made was 107 seconds, but he was informed that there were better\r\n  divers on the island than those he tested. He thinks the water was\r\n  ten to twelve fathoms in depth. A native of Takaroa, named Metuaro,\r\n  told Mr. Burton that he could stay under water three minutes or\r\n  longer. When these divers come up they take a breath and immediately\r\n  put their head under water to prevent headache.\r\n\r\n  Mr. J. Lamb Doty, formerly Consul and now Vice-Consul at Tahiti, who\r\n  has spent eighteen years here, is willing to be quoted as affirming\r\n  that he once timed a diver who remained under water 2 minutes 35\r\n  seconds.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Henry B. Merwin, a leading trader with the Tuamotu Islands, is\r\n  willing to be quoted as saying that he saw a diver remain under\r\n  water 4 minutes 45 seconds by the watch. This is generally regarded,\r\n  so far as my inquiries go, as improbable; but most persons\r\n  interviewed believe that men do remain under water 2½ to 3 minutes.\r\n  A native of Takaroa, named Tai, assured me in the presence of others\r\n  that there were twenty men in that island who could remain under\r\n  water 2½ to 3 minutes at a depth of twenty fathoms. He claimed to be\r\n  able to stay 3 minutes at that depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pearl-divers of the Tuamotu Archipelago; men, women and children dive\r\n    in these waters\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Settlement of pearl fishermen at Hiqueru, Tuamotu Archipelago\r\n]\r\n\r\nDiving-suits, or scaphanders, have been used at most of the South Sea\r\nIslands, but in a very irregular manner. In 1890 the use of scaphanders\r\nwas restricted in the Tuamotu group, and by decree of December 28, 1892,\r\nit was interdicted altogether with a view to preserving the industry to\r\nthe natives, as it represents their principal means of livelihood. The\r\nsuit commonly employed at Penrhyn consists of a helmet and a jumper,\r\nneither boots nor trousers being worn. Owing to the absence of weights\r\non the feet, it rarely but nevertheless sometimes happens that a diver\r\nturns upside down, and the unwieldy helmet keeps him head downward while\r\nthe air rushes out under the bottom cord of the jumper and he is\r\nsuffocated. Also, when a good patch of shells has been located, the\r\ntemptation to remain down too long is great, and paralysis often\r\nresults. On the whole, these diving-suits have proven very dangerous to\r\nthe light, graceful swimmers of these southern seas, to whom they are\r\nabout as much of an impediment as was Saul’s armor to the shepherd lad\r\nwho slew the giant with the simple pebble from a sling.\r\n\r\nAnd there are dangers also in nude diving, even to those who have spent\r\na lifetime about the water. Sharks and sting-rays and devil-fish there\r\nare in abundance, and many of them know the taste of diver’s flesh; on\r\nthe other hand many a daring South Sea Islander could tell of a fierce\r\ncombat more thrilling than even those pictured by Victor Hugo. One of\r\nthe chief advantages of the diving-suit is that in case a shark comes\r\nalong, the diver can bide his time until the fish is ready to leave, or\r\nhe can frighten it away by ejecting air bubbles from the sleeve of his\r\nsuit or by other demonstrations; whereas a nude diver is obliged to seek\r\nthe air without delay, and in the retreat is seized by the fish who,\r\nhuman like, has his appetite increased by the visible retreat of the\r\nobject of his desire.\r\n\r\n  Not Schiller nor Edgar Allan Poe ever conjured up a picture more\r\n  ghastly than that of a Penrhyn diver caught like a rat in a trap by\r\n  some huge, man-eating shark or fierce kara mauua, crouching in a\r\n  cleft of the overhanging coral, under the dark green gloom of a\r\n  hundred feet of water, with bursting lungs and cracking eyeballs,\r\n  while the threatening bulk of his terrible enemy looms dark and\r\n  steady, full in the road to life and air. A minute or more has been\r\n  spent in the downward journey; another minute has passed in the\r\n  agonized wait under the rock.... Has he been seen?... Will the\r\n  creature move away now, while there is still time to return? The\r\n  diver knows to a second how much time has passed; the third minute\r\n  is on its way; but one goes up quicker than one comes down, and\r\n  there is still hope.... Two minutes and a half; it is barely\r\n  possible now, but—the sentinel of death glides forward; his cruel\r\n  eyes, phosphorescent in the gloom, look right into the cleft where\r\n  the wretched creature is crouching, with almost twenty seconds of\r\n  life still left, but now not a shred of hope. A few more beats of\r\n  the laboring pulse, a gasp from the tortured lungs, a sudden rush of\r\n  silvery air bubbles, and the brown limbs collapse down out of the\r\n  cleft like wreaths of seaweed. The shark has his own. (Beatrice\r\n  Grimshaw in the “Graphic.”)\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day’s work, the catch is opened by means of a large\r\nknife, and carefully searched for the much prized pearls. Usually the\r\nfisherman finds none; occasionally he discovers a small round one or a\r\nlarge baroque, and at long intervals—possibly once in two or three\r\nyears—his search is rewarded with a fine pearl for which he may receive\r\n$50 or $60, and there is always the chance that the very next oyster\r\nwill disclose a gem which will make him independent for the remainder of\r\nhis life; and if no pearls whatever are found, there are the shells, the\r\nsale of which furnishes sufficient to purchase tobacco, knives,\r\nfish-hooks, the gaudy cotton cloths, the flour and other simple articles\r\nof food, and especially rum, that fatal gift of civilization which has\r\nbeen the curse of so many primitive peoples.\r\n\r\nSome of the individual pearls secured have been remarkably large,\r\nweighing 100 grains and over. Returning visitors from Tahiti, with views\r\nmagnified doubtless in proportion to the distance of the objects of\r\ntheir description, credited Queen Pomaré with the possession of some\r\nsufficiently large to be used for billiard-balls. Sixty years ago superb\r\npearls could be obtained from the natives for a few gallons of rum or a\r\nsmall number of pieces of cheap calico, and several shrewd traders made\r\ngreat profits in the business. But as trade at the islands was open to\r\nvessels of all nationalities, the competition increased, with the result\r\nthat the natives gradually learned the high estimation in which pearls\r\nare held, and in recent years it has not been unusual for one of medium\r\ngrade to sell higher in Oceanica than it would in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to form a reliable estimate of the value of the pearling\r\nindustry of the South Sea Islands. The Tuamotu group, with 4000\r\nfishermen, yields, in an average season, about 450 tons of\r\nmother-of-pearl, worth about £65,000 in London, where most of it is\r\nmarketed. The yield at the remaining French islands is less than that of\r\nthe Tuamotus. Probably the total yield of mother-of-pearl in all the\r\nSouth Sea Islands is not far from 900 tons, worth about $700,000.\r\n\r\nNo statistics whatever are available regarding the yield of pearls, and\r\nthe estimates sent from the islands are small compared with those made\r\nby London and Paris firms who import the pearls. A large number of\r\npersons living in Papeiti and many traders visiting the islands depend\r\nvery largely on pearl-dealing for a livelihood. From the yield of pearl\r\nshell and estimates made by dealers, we are inclined to put the value of\r\nthe pearls secured in an average season from all the South Sea Islands\r\nat about $125,000, only a small portion of which goes to the fishermen\r\nthemselves, the greater part representing profits of the traders.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PEARL FISHERIES OF AUSTRALIA\r\n\r\n                                 Ocean’s gem, the purest\r\n           Of nature’s works! What days of weary journeyings,\r\n           What sleepless nights, what toils on land and sea,\r\n           Are borne by men to gain thee!\r\n\r\n                                                   UNKNOWN.\r\n\r\nAs regards area of distribution the most extensive pearl-oyster grounds\r\nof the world are situated on the northern and western coasts of\r\nAustralia. These are located within the jurisdictions of Queensland,\r\nWestern Australia, and South Australia; and extend in irregular patches\r\nfrom near Cooktown on the northeast almost to Fremantle at the\r\nsouthwest, a distance of nearly 3000 miles. Those in Queensland are\r\ncommonly known as the Torres Straits fisheries, as they are especially\r\nimportant there; but they extend a considerable distance beyond each end\r\nof the strait, and pearling expeditions are made from the limits of the\r\nGreat Barrier coral reef northward to the vicinity of New Guinea.[248]\r\nThose of Western Australia are commonly spoken of as the Northwest\r\nfisheries.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries of Queensland and of Western Australia are approximately\r\nequal in extent, as regards number of vessels, boats, and men employed,\r\nand the quantity and value of the catch, with the advantage slightly in\r\nfavor of the Northwest fishery in the last four or five years. In 1905,\r\naccording to the official figures, the Queensland fishery gave\r\nemployment to 348 vessels and 2850 men, and yielded shell and pearls\r\nworth £135,000, which was the smallest output since 1890. The Western\r\nAustralia fishery, exclusive of Sharks Bay, employed 365 vessels in\r\n1905, and about the same number of men as in Queensland, and yielded\r\n£196,000 worth of shell and pearls. The fishery of South Australia\r\nemployed about 60 vessels and 375 men, and yielded about £25,000 worth\r\nof shell and pearls. This makes for the whole of Australia, except\r\nSharks Bay hereinafter noted, a total of 773 vessels, 6075 men, and an\r\noutput worth £356,000. It should be understood that the South Australia\r\nfishery is not prosecuted on the southern coast of the continent, but on\r\nthe northern coast, in what is known as the Northern Territory of South\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThree species of pearl-oysters are found in Australian waters. The\r\nlargest species, _Margaritifera maxima_, which is by far the most\r\nimportant and widely distributed, occurs to a greater or less extent\r\nthroughout the whole of this region. This yields the standard\r\nmotherof-pearl of commerce. Although the pearls which it yields are\r\namong the largest and finest in the world, this mollusk is sought more\r\nparticularly for the shell, the value of which from season to season\r\naverages three or four times as much as that of the pearls. Ordinarily\r\nthis shell is uniformly white over the entire inner surface, and is\r\ncommonly known locally as “silver lip”; but some “golden-edged” shell\r\noccurs on the muddy grounds in narrow passages between the islands on\r\nthe northwest coast.\r\n\r\nWhile this species is gregarious, it is not located in densely covered\r\nbeds, but is scattered in patches over the reefs. Some of these are\r\nmiles in length and contain scores of tons, but visually they are very\r\nmuch smaller. The oysters occur principally on rocky bottom, and also on\r\nclay and sand when well covered with seaweeds, but are rarely found on\r\nmuddy ground. They are most numerous in the channels where the current\r\nis strong. The small oysters are generally loosely attached by the\r\nbyssus to rock, gravel or other shells; while the mature ones lie\r\nloosely on the bottom or slightly turned in the sand.\r\n\r\nThe second species of the Australian pearl-oysters, _Margaritifera\r\nmargaritifera_, is smaller, rarely exceeding eight inches in diameter\r\nand a weight of two pounds. The distinguishing characteristic is the\r\nblack edge bordering the inner surface of the shell, whence it acquired\r\nthe local designation “black lip.” This variety is not rare in\r\nQueensland, and in Western Australia its range extends as far as\r\nChampion Bay in Lat. 29° S. However, the catch is small compared with\r\nthat of the _Margaritifera maxima_, amounting to only two or three per\r\ncent. in Queensland. In 1905, the export of “silver lip” and\r\n“golden-edged” from Thursday Island was 527 tons, and of “black lip”\r\nonly 11 tons; in 1904, these figures were 778 and 7 respectively. In\r\nWestern Australia the percentage of yield is much larger than this.\r\n\r\nThe third species, _Margaritifera carcharium_, is confined almost\r\nentirely to the limits of Sharks Bay, on the extreme western coast of\r\nAustralia. At maturity it is the smallest of the three, averaging three\r\nor four inches in diameter, and about equals in size the Lingah\r\npearl-oyster of the Persian Gulf. The percentage of pearls therefrom is\r\nrelatively greater than from the larger variety; but, owing to its small\r\nsize and lack of thickness, the shell is of little commercial value. The\r\nvalue of the output in recent years has approximated two or three\r\nthousand pounds sterling, which is very much less than formerly, the\r\nvalue of the shell having greatly decreased since the introduction of\r\nthe Mississippi shell in button manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe pearl fishery on the coast of Australia originated about 1861. It\r\nappears that an American sailor named Tays was the pioneer in the\r\nbusiness; and on his death by drowning, the business was conducted by\r\nhis partner named Seubert.[249] This was on the northwest coast, and the\r\noutput reached the market by way of Singapore. At first the oysters were\r\nso abundant in shallow water that they could be picked up at low tide,\r\nand beach-combing was profitable, especially when carried on with cheap\r\nnative labor. As the beach-beds became exhausted, the natives were\r\nencouraged to wade out to greater depths, and soon they became\r\naccustomed to “bob under” for those oysters visible from the surface.\r\nThe Australian blacks were thus taught to dive, and in 1867 diving from\r\nboats in two or three fathoms was attempted with such success that in\r\nthe following year the practice was generally adopted, the depth in\r\nwhich they worked gradually extending to six or eight fathoms. In diving\r\nfrom a boat, the men imitated “bobbing under” which they had practised\r\nin shoaler water; they slipped off the gunwale feet foremost, and when\r\nsix or eight feet below the surface, turned and swam downward.\r\n\r\nOwing to the close labor relations existing between the natives and the\r\nsheep-raisers of northwestern Australia, the latter were brought into\r\nthe business, and for a number of years pearling and sheep-raising were\r\nclosely associated. The blacks were employed in various duties in\r\nconnection with raising and shearing sheep, and it was important to find\r\nsome occupation for them when ranch-work was slack, not only for their\r\nown subsistence but for the protection of the herdsmen and their\r\nproperty. Fortunately, this opportunity was furnished by the pearl\r\nfishery, for which these men were well qualified.\r\n\r\nThe profits of the business soon attracted many outside capitalists, and\r\nit became difficult to procure divers. Not only did the pearlers—and\r\nparticularly new-comers—resort to impressing the blacks into service,\r\nbut skilled fishermen were brought over from the Malay Archipelago, and\r\nin some cases the methods used in securing them were by no means\r\nregular.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 the Northwest pearl fishery gave employment to 12 vessels of 15\r\nto 50 tons each, and yielded about 180 tons of mother-of-pearl. During\r\nthe same year, in Torres Straits, where the industry had extended about\r\n1868, there were 10 vessels—mostly from the port of Sydney—and the catch\r\nof mother-of-pearl approximated 200 tons, valued at £60,000 in\r\nLondon.[250] Each vessel was commonly manned by two or three white men\r\nand from ten to fifty divers, who worked from dinghys, in gangs of six\r\nor eight each with an overseer in charge.\r\n\r\nAs the fishery increased rapidly in extent, the problem of securing nude\r\ndivers became a serious one, and “nigger hunting” became rather common,\r\nthe Australian black man representing the cheapest form of labor,\r\nworking for his food, tobacco, and the simplest articles of clothing.\r\nThere was no complaint that the men thus impressed were treated with\r\ninhumanity; on the contrary they were well fed and cared for; yet, with\r\na view to protecting them and preventing even a suspicion of\r\nwrong-doing, the Australian government enacted regulations restricting\r\npearling contracts with the natives. Nearly every year these regulations\r\nbecame more stringent, affecting the hours for diving, and limiting the\r\nwork to depths of six and a half fathoms, so that the employment of\r\nAustralian aborigines in the fishery became extremely troublesome and\r\nannoying.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Netherlands also placed severe restrictions on the\r\nemployment of natives of the Dutch Indies, requiring security of £20 per\r\nhead for the repatriation of each man; and the local chiefs or rajahs\r\nalso expected a rake-off before permitting their men to ship. These\r\nMalays—from the islands of Solor, Allor, Adonare, etc.,—also expected\r\nmuch better pay and better provisions than the Australian blacks.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account by Henry Taunton gives a graphic\r\ndescription of the fishery as carried on at that time:\r\n\r\n  The work was far from easy. It was exhausting and perilous for the\r\n  divers, and full of privation, exposure, and danger for the white\r\n  men. Only the hope of a prosperous season reconciled one to the\r\n  life. When shells were plentiful and the weather fine, the work was\r\n  exciting and interesting enough; but during rough weather, when one\r\n  had to be constantly straining at the oar to keep the dinghy from\r\n  drifting too rapidly, or when hour after hour might pass without the\r\n  men bringing up a single shell, the discouragement was great. The\r\n  rays of the vertical sun beating down on one’s shoulders at such\r\n  times seemed as if it would never reach the western horizon, which\r\n  was the signal for returning on board.\r\n\r\n  As may well be imagined, when three or four white men had to control\r\n  and compel some thirty or forty natives to carry on work which they\r\n  detested, a very strict discipline had to be maintained. It was the\r\n  rule that no talking was allowed amongst the divers when in the\r\n  dinghy, nor were they even permitted to address the white man,\r\n  unless, maybe, to answer a question as to the nature of the bottom,\r\n  whether _nanoo_ (sand) or _bannin_ (shelly bottom), etc., or unless\r\n  some urgent necessity arose. Sometimes, indeed, I have pushed off\r\n  from the vessel’s side of a morning and have not heard a word spoken\r\n  until we returned on board at night, unless chance might take me\r\n  within hail of some other dinghy, when felicitations or condolences\r\n  would be exchanged, as good or bad luck might happen. At times, when\r\n  the “patch” was small, the dinghys of the whole fleet might be\r\n  congregated on a very small area, in which case the scene was\r\n  animated enough. On all sides you could see divers slipping into the\r\n  water and others just coming to the surface, puffing, blowing, and\r\n  coughing to clear their eyes, ears, and mouth from the salt\r\n  water—some with, others without shells. Others would be swimming to\r\n  regain their dinghy or squatting in their places for the few\r\n  minutes’ rest permitted, and, if the wind were at all fresh,\r\n  shivering with cold; for although the weather might be extremely\r\n  hot, the constant plunging in and out for many hours at a time\r\n  tended to reduce the bodily temperature considerably. The white men\r\n  would be seen standing up in each dinghy. They were lightly clad,\r\n  with shirt sleeves and trousers rolled up, in all varieties and\r\n  colours of costume, from the regulation shirt, trousers, and felt\r\n  hat, with leather belt sustaining sheath-knife and pouch, to the\r\n  more comfortable pyjama suit, or even the Malay sarong. Some would\r\n  be straining hard at the end of the scull-oar, forcing the boat\r\n  against wind and tide in the endeavor to keep it as long as possible\r\n  on the “patch,” which was marked by the discoverer’s buoy, which\r\n  also might be observed nodding on the surface, and canted over by\r\n  the swiftly rushing tide. Others, their men all being below, just\r\n  kept the dinghy’s head to wind until, by judicious use of the oar\r\n  and well-calculated drifting, all the divers reappear on the surface\r\n  within a short distance from their own boat. This is the secret of\r\n  saving the divers from wasting their powers and time uselessly....\r\n  As may be supposed, where the tide sweeps the divers along the\r\n  bottom at the rate of three or four or even six miles an hour, they\r\n  have to be very smart in seeking and grabbing any shell within\r\n  reach. I have never tested them with a time-keeper; but by counting\r\n  seconds on many occasions, from the moment a diver’s head sank below\r\n  until it again came above the surface, I estimated the average time\r\n  under water was fifty-seven seconds. Part of this is of course\r\n  expended in swimming to the bottom, where they can remain only a\r\n  very few seconds, as time must be allowed for reaching the surface\r\n  before letting go their breath. Practice in ever-varying depths\r\n  enables them to gauge this limit of time to a nicety. But sometimes\r\n  they cut things too fine, and then a catastrophe was inevitable,\r\n  unless much watchfulness was exercised by the white man, who has to\r\n  keep his eyes turned in all directions once his men are down. So\r\n  long as a diver can hold his breath the pressure forces him to the\r\n  surface at a speed which seldom requires accelerating by strokes\r\n  with the hands or feet; but the moment he lets go his breath—if\r\n  under water—his upward course is arrested and his body commences to\r\n  sink. Now, when the white man sees this, either he must plunge in to\r\n  the rescue himself, or direct such divers who may be on the top to\r\n  do the needful.\r\n\r\n  On a calm day, when one can see far into the blue clear depths\r\n  below, I have often seen one of my men shooting rapidly upwards\r\n  until within perhaps a foot or two from the surface, when a sudden\r\n  gush of bubbles from the man’s mouth would tell its own tale.\r\n  Instantly he would begin to sink gently downwards, and only quick\r\n  action could save this diver who had miscalculated his time.\r\n  However, as it was not infrequent for divers to go down and never\r\n  come up at all, one may conclude that, where the time to be allowed\r\n  is comprised in so few seconds, even the most experienced make fatal\r\n  errors.[251]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties in securing labor at length resulted in experiments\r\nwith the scaphander or diving dress, and gradually its adoption by most\r\nof the pearling fleet. The labor problem and the exhaustion of the\r\noysters in medium depths developed more quickly in Torres Straits than\r\non the northwest coast, and diving outfits were introduced there about\r\n1879, while this was delayed about five years longer on the northwest\r\ncoast. The outfit did not immediately supplant nude diving in either\r\nlocality. In 1883, only 80 of the 206 Queensland vessels were supplied\r\nwith scaphanders, the others continuing to use nude diving, and even yet\r\nnearly one third of the vessels depend on that form of fishery. Of the\r\n353 vessels fishing in 1904, 108 depended on nude divers and 245 were\r\nsupplied with armored equipment.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 the Queensland government took cognizance of the rapidly\r\ndeveloping industry, and enacted a license system and other regulations.\r\nFor every boat under two tons an annual license fee of £1 (in 1886 this\r\nwas reduced to ten shillings) was enacted, and for every vessel of ten\r\ntons or under, the sum of £3, with an additional amount for vessels in\r\nexcess of that measurement; but not exceeding £20 in any case.[252] In\r\n1886 it was required by the Queensland government that every person\r\nemployed “as a diver, and using a diving apparatus,” must be licensed\r\nannually, for which a fee of £1 is exacted.[253] And in 1891 it was\r\nrequired that “every diving dress and air-pump and all air-tubes and\r\ngear used in the fishery in connection with diving must be submitted to\r\nan inspector for examination once at least in every period of six\r\nmonths.”[254] The license system was adopted in Western Australia in\r\n1886, a fee of £1 per annum being exacted for each vessel engaged in the\r\nfishery.[255] In 1891, South Australia adopted the license system,\r\nrequiring that every boat of two tons or under should pay ten shillings,\r\nand that each boat over that measurement should pay twenty shillings.\r\n\r\nWith a view to protecting the reefs, the government of Queensland in\r\n1891 enacted a law forbidding the sale or removal—except for cultivation\r\npurposes—of any pearl shell “of the kind scientifically known as\r\n_Meleagrina margaritifera_, and of either of the varieties commonly\r\nknown as ‘golden-edged’ and ‘silver lip,’ of which the nacre or\r\nmother-of-pearl measures less than six inches from the butt or hinge to\r\nthe opposite edge or lip, but this does not apply to the variety\r\ncommonly called ‘dwarf-shell.’”[256] Owing to the difficulty in\r\nenforcing this regulation, the size restriction was reduced in 1897 to\r\nfive inches from the hinge to the opposite lip, or six and one half\r\ninches exteriorly, shells of this size weighing approximately one pound.\r\nIt is claimed that many oysters less than five inches in length are\r\nraised, opened for pearls, and then cast back into the water.[257] In\r\n1899 the governor of South Australia interdicted the capture in the\r\nwaters of that territory of any shell of “_Meleagrina margaritifera_\r\nmeasuring less than four inches from the butt or hinge to the opposite\r\nedge or lip.” Competent evidence exists that a good-sized pearl has been\r\nfound in an oyster measuring one inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pearling boats at Hiqueru, Tuamotu Archipelago\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Australian pearl-diver (armored) coming up from the depths\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fishermen of Western Australia rendezvous at Broome, about one\r\nthousand miles by water north of Perth, the nearest railway station.\r\nWith only a thousand or so inhabitants, under normal conditions, this is\r\na scene of great activity, and bears a reputation of being no\r\nSunday-school when the fishermen are in, with tons of shell and many a\r\npickle bottle more or less full of pearls. Cossack and Onslow are also\r\nimportant stations.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, 340 luggers and 25 schooners were employed in the pearl\r\nfisheries of Western Australia, exclusive of Sharks Bay. Of this number\r\nabout 85 per cent. hailed from Broome. The schooners ranged in size from\r\n13 to 133 tons, and the luggers were mostly about 12 tons, with a\r\nminimum of 3 and a maximum of 14 tons. The total number of fishermen\r\napproximated 2900, a medley of races, Japanese, Malays, Chinese, Arabs,\r\nnative aboriginals and South Sea Islanders working together more or less\r\nharmoniously. The yield consisted of 1394 tons of mother-of-pearl, with\r\na declared value of £146,225, and about £50,000 worth of pearls, a total\r\nof £196,255 for the year, which was an increase of £32,286 over\r\n1904.[258]\r\n\r\nThe headquarters for the fishery of the Northern Territory of South\r\nAustralia are at Port Darwin. In 1905 this fishery employed forty-nine\r\nsail vessels and two canoes manned by Europeans, and two proas and\r\ntwelve canoes manned by Malays. The crews, numbering about 375,\r\nconsisted mainly of Malays, Japanese and Filipinos. In 1905, 42 per\r\ncent. were Malays, 24 per cent. were Japanese, and 20 per cent. were\r\nFilipinos. Owing to the low price of pearl shell, the fishery was not\r\nprosecuted actively, and many of the Asiatics left for the pearling\r\nreefs at the Aru Islands. The total value of pearl shells reported among\r\nthe exports for that year was £18,526; during the preceding year it was\r\n£28,391. No record is available for the value of the pearls.\r\n\r\nThe Queensland pearling fleet has its rendezvous at Port Kennedy,\r\nThursday Island, which was originally maintained by the British, the\r\nQueensland, and the New South Wales governments as a harbor of refuge\r\nfor mariners. Politically this port is important as the strategic key to\r\nthe northeast of Australia, but its prosperity is almost wholly\r\ndependent on the pearl-oyster fishery. The population approximates 1600,\r\nconsisting largely of Japanese, Malays, Cingalese, Pacific islanders,\r\nand Australian aborigines, with specimens from nearly every Asiatic and\r\nEuropean nationality, and some from America and Africa. The Japanese\r\npredominate, their influx dating from 1891; and at present the industry\r\nis largely dependent on these Scotchmen of the Orient for its most\r\nskilful workmen. The heterogeneous nationalities, and the abundance of\r\nsand-flies, mosquitos, etc., make this island rather less desirable as a\r\nplace of residence than it is interesting from a political and\r\nethnological point of view.\r\n\r\nThe Queensland fishery in 1905 employed 348 vessels, and yielded 543\r\ntons of shell, according to the government returns. In 1904, 353 vessels\r\nwere engaged, and the catch was 798 tons of shell.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fifteen years there has been a very steady decrease in\r\nthe average catch of pearl-oysters per boat in the Australian fishery.\r\nThe average catch in the Queensland fleet in 1890 approximated 7 tons\r\nper boat; from 1898 to 1903 it was about 3 tons annually; in 1904 it was\r\nonly 2¼ tons, and in 1905 a trifle more than 1½ tons. The yearly\r\nincreasing number of boats would naturally lower the average, but the\r\ndecrease is generally ascribed to the denudation of the reefs, due to\r\nclose working for thirty-five years without giving them a chance to\r\nrecuperate.\r\n\r\nThe small yield in Queensland in 1904 and 1905 was due largely ta the\r\nextended rough weather and the accompanying thick or muddy water, which\r\npresented an obstacle to the prosecution of the work. Mr. Hugh Milman,\r\nthe government resident at Thursday Island, states that each year the\r\nbeds in the more sheltered spots have been extensively fished, rendering\r\nit necessary for the fleet to go farther afield in places where the\r\ndepth of water is greater, and where the vessels are more exposed to the\r\nfull force of the southeast winds which prevail for about seven months\r\nof the year, and which were unusually severe in 1905.[259] The general\r\ndenudation of the beds is not the principal cause of the decreased take.\r\nAn additional cause for the falling off in 1905 was the deflection of a\r\nlarge percentage of the fleet to new fields of operation, 110 vessels\r\nleaving for the Aru Islands in the Arafura Sea, when the season was\r\nabout half finished.\r\n\r\nFor vessels using diving apparatus, the season continues throughout the\r\nyear, but it is frequently interrupted by storms, which may cause the\r\nboats to lie in harbor for ten days, or even two weeks at a time. The\r\nnude divers suspend work from December to March, and also during the\r\nseason of gales.\r\n\r\nEach vessel is manned by a diver, his attendant, and a crew of four men,\r\nwho in pairs take alternate shifts at the manual pump for supplying air\r\nto the diver. The entire force of men take part in managing the vessel\r\nand in caring for the catch. The vessel is provided with full equipment\r\nand supplies of food, water, etc., to last two or three weeks, depending\r\non the distance of the fishing grounds from the shore station, or the\r\nfrequency of trips made by a supply vessel.\r\n\r\nExcept a number of owners and their representatives, there are now very\r\nfew white persons engaged in pearling in Australian waters. Even the\r\npersons in charge of the vessels are largely natives of the Pacific\r\nIslands. Owing to the hardships encountered and the small remuneration,\r\nit is difficult to secure white labor; and aliens from Japan, the\r\nPhilippines, Java, Singapore, India and New Guinea, are employed.\r\n\r\nThe divers are of many nationalities, principally Japanese and Malays,\r\nand the former are said to be the most efficient. Previous to 1890, they\r\nwere mostly whites, and were paid at the rate of £40 per ton of shells;\r\nbut increased competition and the influx of cheaper labor caused a\r\nconsiderable decrease in the rate of compensation, driving most of the\r\nwhite men out of the employment. At present the Japanese almost\r\nmonopolize the business. Of the 367 divers licensed at Thursday Island\r\nin 1905, 291 were Japanese, 32 were Filipinos, 21 were from Rotuma\r\nIsland, 16 were Malays, and 7 were of other nationalities; this shows\r\nhow completely the white man has been driven out of this skilled branch\r\nof labor.\r\n\r\nThe oysters are so scattered that considerable walking is necessary to\r\nfind them. They usually lie with the shells partly open, and in grasping\r\nthem the fisherman must be careful not to insert a finger within the\r\nopen shell, or a very bad pinch will result. The progress of the vessel\r\nmust be adapted to that of the diver, and when a good clump of oysters\r\nis found it may even be desirable to anchor. If the current and wind are\r\njust right, the vessel may repeatedly drift over a bed, the diver\r\nascending and remaining on board while the vessel is retracing its\r\ncourse to the windward side of the reef. On new grounds, the nature of\r\nthe bottom is determined by casting the lead properly tipped with soap\r\nor tallow, and the prospects for oysters thus determined without\r\ndescending.\r\n\r\nDuring good weather and in eight or ten fathoms of water, a diver can\r\nwork almost continually, and need not return to the surface for two\r\nhours or more; but as the depth increases, the length of time he may\r\nremain at the bottom in safety decreases almost in geometric ratio, and\r\nhe comes to the surface frequently for a “blow” with helmet removed.\r\nEvidence secured by a departmental commission of the Queensland\r\ngovernment in 1897, showed that in good weather at a depth of eight or\r\nten fathoms, a diver works from sunrise to sunset, coming to the surface\r\nonly a few times. In a depth of over fifteen fathoms the attendant\r\nusually has instructions not to let him remain longer than fifteen\r\nminutes at a time; yet a diver’s eagerness in working where good shell\r\nis plentiful sometimes impels him to order the attendant to disregard\r\nthis rule. The very great pressure of the water—amounting to thirty-nine\r\npounds or more to the square inch—is liable to cause paralysis, and\r\ndeath occasionally results. In working at a depth of twenty to\r\ntwenty-five fathoms, a diver is rarely under water longer than half an\r\nhour altogether during the day. The greatest depth from which shell is\r\nbrought appears from the same evidence to be “30 fathoms and a little\r\nover”; but at that depth—where the pressure is seventy-eight pounds to\r\nthe square inch—the fisherman remains down only a few minutes at a\r\nstretch, and should be exceedingly careful. The work is injurious, and\r\neven under the best conditions the diver not infrequently becomes\r\nsemi-paralyzed and disqualified in a few years. Notwithstanding that the\r\nwork is performed by men in vigorous health, nearly every year there are\r\nfrom ten to twenty-five deaths in the Queensland fleet alone;[260] three\r\nfourths of these are due to paralysis, and most of the remaining result\r\nfrom suffocation, owing largely to inexperience in use of gear. From\r\nfive to ten years is the usual length of a man’s diving career, although\r\nin the fleet may be found men who have been diving for twenty-five years\r\nor more.\r\n\r\nOn the vessels manned by Japanese, commonly several members of the crew\r\nare competent divers and take a turn at the work, although only one\r\nlicense is secured. Such a vessel carries only one head-piece, but two\r\notherwise complete suits, the helmet fitting either, so that as soon as\r\none exhausted diver comes up to rest, a successor is ready to have the\r\nhelmet screwed to his body-dress and descend without delay, thus saving\r\nabout half an hour in the changing.\r\n\r\nThe nude divers in the Australian pearl fisheries are mostly Malays and\r\nAustralian aborigines. They work from dinghys operated from a vessel,\r\neach dinghy carrying six or eight divers, usually with a white man as\r\noverseer. The man in charge sculls against the tide to keep the boat\r\nstationary over the ground, and all the fishermen of a particular dinghy\r\ndescend together for greater safety from sharks, and to cover the ground\r\nsystematically. On rising, each diver swims to the boat, throws his\r\ncatch over the gunwale, and climbs in to rest for a few minutes.\r\nSometimes two or possibly even three oysters may be brought up at a\r\nsingle descent, but a diver is doing well if he brings up one oyster in\r\nten descents. The average daily catch of each man is probably two or\r\nthree oysters, but a fisherman has been known to bring up fifty in one\r\nday. On some vessels, those who fall behind in the catch are punished by\r\nextra duty aboard ship.\r\n\r\nThe pearling industry has had a marked effect on the industrial and\r\nsocial condition of the natives of the Australian coast and the adjacent\r\nislands. Many of these natives now have boats of their own, and others\r\nseek employment on other vessels. Law and order and decent respect for\r\nproperty have arisen, with schools and churches. The result is all the\r\nmore remarkable when it is considered that scarcely more than a\r\ngeneration has passed since labor among the men was unknown, the women\r\ndoing all the work necessary to meet their scanty requirements.\r\n\r\nAs now carried on in Australia, pearling is a hard life, the men working\r\nfor two thirds of the season in a dead calm and oppressive heat, while\r\nin the remaining months they are rolling day and night. The members of\r\nthe crew are not allowed ashore without a written permission from the\r\ncaptain of the boat, and men and luggage are searched on leaving the\r\nvessel. In addition to these objections, life on board is not unusually\r\nmade intensely disagreeable by the myriads of inch-long cockroaches,\r\nwhich are attracted by and multiply rapidly on the shreds of muscle left\r\non the pearl shell stored in the hold. Storms are frequent on the coast.\r\nIn February, 1899, three schooners and eighty smaller vessels were\r\nwrecked, and eleven white and four hundred colored men were drowned.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each day’s fishing, the oysters are cleaned of submarine\r\ngrowths. Sometimes this is by no means an easy task, as many of the\r\nshells are so covered with weeds, coral, and sponge as to bear little\r\nresemblance to oysters. After they have been scrubbed and the edges have\r\nbeen chipped, they are washed and stored on deck. Early the following\r\nmorning they are opened and examined for pearls. This opening is done\r\ncarefully to avoid injury to any pearl that may be within. The hinge of\r\nthe shell is placed on the deck and a broad knife forced down so as to\r\nsever the adductor muscle, causing the shells to spring open and\r\npermitting the removal of the soft parts. The flesh is carefully\r\nexamined, both by sight and by feeling, to locate all pearls, which are\r\npicked out by hand and placed in a suitable receptacle. Within the\r\nadductor muscle are found seed-pearls and small baroques; the large\r\npearls are found embedded in the mantle, where their presence may be\r\ndetected as soon as the shell is opened, the pearly gleam contrasting\r\nwith the light blue of the mantle. Sometimes, though rarely, large\r\npearls are found loose within the shell, whence they roll out when the\r\nshell is opened. Valuable pearls are occasionally removed from blisters\r\non the surface of the shell, or from within the body of the nacre\r\nitself. Even when empty, these blisters are valuable, and are especially\r\nadapted for brooches and other ornaments requiring a broad and\r\nrelatively flat surface.\r\n\r\nAfter the flesh has been carefully examined throughout, it is discarded,\r\nas it is not considered suitable for food, and the shell is dried for\r\nhalf a day or so to make the hinge brittle in order that it may be\r\nbroken without injury to the mother-of-pearl. After the shell has been\r\nroughly cleaned, it is placed in the hold, if the vessel is operating\r\nfrom a shore station, as is commonly the case in Torres Straits. Since\r\nlong exposure to the sun affects the quality of the mother-of-pearl, it\r\nis important that it be kept under cover. On returning to the station,\r\nit is thoroughly cleaned, assorted, dried, the dark edges clipped off,\r\nand the cleaned shell is packed in shipping cases, each containing from\r\n250 to 325 pounds. On the west coast, where the vessels at times operate\r\n200 or 300 miles from port, the shell is cleaned, assorted and crated on\r\nthe vessels; whence it may be delivered direct to the steamers. The\r\nNorthwest shell is somewhat smaller than the mature shell of Torres\r\nStraits, averaging about 1100 to the ton, whereas that of Thursday\r\nIsland runs about 725 to the ton.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to prevent the theft of pearls by the fishermen as\r\nthey are liable to treat them as perquisites if not carefully watched.\r\nIndeed, on the Torres Straits vessels it has come about that pearls do\r\nnot constitute a recognized source of income to the proprietors. There\r\nthe fishery is now conducted almost exclusively for the shells, as the\r\nwage-earners secrete probably as many valuable pearls as they turn over\r\nto the rightful owners. The hot sun causes many of the oysters to open,\r\nand deft fingers quickly pick out such pearls as may be visible. An\r\noyster may be induced to open its shell by being held near the galley\r\nfire on the lugger, and the insertion of a piece of cork holds it open\r\nwhile a pearl is shaken out or hooked out by means of a piece of wire.\r\nThen the cork is removed and the oyster closes again with no evidence of\r\nrobbery. The proprietors of boats who themselves open the oysters almost\r\ninvariably secure larger yields of fine pearls than those who depend on\r\npaid employees, who rarely have the luck to find choice pearls, judging\r\nfrom what they turn in. The government of Queensland has endeavored to\r\nput a stop to pearl stealing, and by enactment[261] of 1891, it\r\nrestricted all selling or buying of pearls within the fishing region\r\nexcept through regularly licensed dealers, whose transactions are open\r\nto examination.\r\n\r\nBut the fishermen seem to have little difficulty in evading the laws,\r\nand throughout the fleet the men have become so adept that they regard\r\nthe pearls as their contraband perquisites. And the ease with which\r\nthese may be secreted is surpassed only by the facility with which they\r\nmay be sold, notwithstanding legislation to the contrary. Indeed, some\r\nemployers make no claim to the pearls found, thus enabling them to\r\nsecure fishermen at lower rates of wages.\r\n\r\nAs previously noted, the pearls constitute only an incidental catch in\r\nthe fisheries on the Australian coast, but in the aggregate the yield is\r\nvery large. The yield in the northwest Australian fishery in 1906 is\r\nestimated at £50,000, local valuation; in the Queensland fishery\r\n£33,000; in that of South Australia £5000, a total of £88,000 or\r\n$440,000.[262] Relatively few seed-pearls are obtained, and some of the\r\npearls are of great size. Some beautiful specimens have been found, but\r\nusually they have less luster and are more irregular in form than the\r\nPersian or the Indian output.\r\n\r\nAmong the remedies suggested for improving the condition of the\r\nAustralian pearl reefs may be mentioned the establishment of six inches\r\nas the minimum size of the shell that may be taken (five inches is now\r\npermitted in Queensland, and there is no restriction in Western\r\nAustralia), the closure of certain areas for stated periods from time to\r\ntime, and a limit on the number of vessels employed. The government\r\nresident at Thursday Island, Mr. Hugh Milman, who has had long\r\nacquaintance with the industry, strongly recommends the adoption of a\r\nsystem of artificial culture; and in the meantime, to foster the\r\nindustry, “licenses should be granted to a reduced number of boats and\r\ncertain sheltered areas should be closed altogether for a few years to\r\ngive the beds time to recover. This latter procedure, however, the\r\npearlers themselves are not in favor of, as they are of the opinion that\r\nthe weather conditions against which they have to contend are sufficient\r\nprotection to prevent the denudation of the principal grounds.”\r\n\r\nA few years ago certain areas in Torres Straits were proclaimed closed\r\nfor a period against the removal of pearl shell; but, owing to the want\r\nof effective patrol, the shell was poached to a very large extent, and\r\nconsequently the good that should have resulted from the experiment was\r\nnot apparent. Owing to the impracticability of continuous patrol, and\r\nthe want of proper legislation to bring die offenders to book, it was\r\ndecided to remove the restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe Sharks Bay fishery, to which we have previously referred,[263] is\r\nprosecuted by means of small sail-boats using light dredges, except in\r\nthe case of the very shallow or “pick-up banks,” where the oysters are\r\ncommonly removed by hand. Some years ago this fishery was of much local\r\nimportance; but the developing scarcity of the oysters, and the present\r\nlow value of this grade of shell in Europe, due to the competition with\r\nMississippi shell, have resulted in a great reduction. In 1905, the\r\nindustry gave employment to 17 small boats and 42 men, of whom 18 were\r\nEuropeans, 13 Asiatics, and 11 aboriginal natives. The yield of pearls,\r\naccording to official report of the government of Western Australia,\r\napproximated £2000 in value, and of pearl shell there was 88 tons, with\r\na declared value of £607. In 1896 the government of Western Australia\r\nsurveyed the Sharks Bay reefs, and opened them to preëmption in small\r\nareas for cultivating this species of pearl-oyster. At present they are\r\nmostly held under exclusive licenses for a period of fourteen years. The\r\nbusiness is under an elaborate system of regulations; but as appears\r\nfrom the above figures the results have not been important.\r\n\r\nPearls are more numerous in this pearl-oyster than in the two other\r\nAustralian species. In removing them from the flesh, a modification of\r\nthe Ceylon process is adopted. The mollusks are opened by means of a\r\nknife, and the contents of the shells are placed in vats or tubs—known\r\nlocally as “poogie tubs”; and, exposed to the hot sun, are allowed to\r\nputrefy. Sea water is added, and the putrid mass stirred; after several\r\ndays the water and the thoroughly disintegrated flesh tissues are\r\ndecanted, leaving the pearls at the bottom. The odor from a number of\r\nthese “poogie tubs” is said to almost rival that of the “washing\r\ntoddies” at Marichchikadde.\r\n\r\nThe Sharks Bay pearls are commonly yellowish or straw-colored, and\r\nsometimes have a beautiful golden tinge. Although obtained from small\r\nshells, they are sometimes of considerable size—twenty grains or more in\r\nweight, and fine specimens sell for several hundred dollars each. China\r\nand India furnish better markets for them than Europe or America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                PEARL FISHERIES OF THE MALAY ARCHIPELAGO\r\n\r\n          My thoughts arise and fade in solitude;\r\n          The verse that would invest them melts away\r\n          Like moonlight in the heaven of spreading day.\r\n          How beautiful they were, how firm they stood,\r\n          Flecking the starry sky like woven pearl.\r\n\r\n                                      SHELLEY, _My Thoughts_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Opening pearl-oysters and searching for pearls, off the coast of\r\n    Australia\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Grading, weighing, and packing mother-of-pearl, off the coast of\r\n    Australia\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor nearly four hundred years, pearls and pearl shells have been the\r\nmost beautiful objects which have reached the outside world from the\r\nmany islands of the Malay Archipelago. On his visit to this part of the\r\nworld in 1520, Pigopitta, a companion of Magalhães, reported pearls\r\namong the prized possessions of the natives. The fisheries have never\r\nbeen of great importance, although the reefs are widely scattered\r\nthroughout the archipelago, and the possibilities seem favorable for\r\nvery great development. Thomas de Comyn stated a century ago, that pearl\r\nfisheries had been undertaken “from time to time about Mindanao, Zebu,\r\nand some of the smaller islands, but with little success and less\r\nregularity, not because of a scarcity of fine pearls, but on account of\r\na lack of skill of the divers and their well-established dread of\r\nsharks.”[264]\r\n\r\nGiacinto Gemmi,[265] writing of Philippine pearls, repeats a strange\r\ntale from the “Storia de Mindanao” by the Jesuit father, Combes, to the\r\neffect that in a certain spot, under many fathoms of water, there was a\r\npearl of inestimable value, as large as an egg; but, although the king’s\r\nministers had made every effort to have it secured, they had always been\r\nunsuccessful.\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty years, pearls and pearl shells have been secured\r\nfrom most of the inshore waters of Malaysia, but the output has not been\r\nso regular or so extensive as the conditions seem to warrant. Our\r\nobservation leads to the conviction that this is not due so much to lack\r\nof skill on the part of the divers, or to their dread of sharks,\r\nmentioned by Comyn; but to the fact that foreign capital, attracted to\r\nthis part of the world, has found more security and profit in developing\r\nplantations, and the natives have not had sufficient enterprise to\r\nsystematize and develop the fishery resources.\r\n\r\nThroughout Malaysia, including the Philippine Islands, the pearl is\r\nknown as _mutya_, _mootara_, or a similar name, closely resembling the\r\nSanskrit _mukta_ or the Cingalese _mootoo_, indicating the source of the\r\ninfluence originating the fishery and trade.\r\n\r\nThe most widely-known pearl fisheries of Malaysia are in the Sulu\r\nArchipelago, a group of islands comprising about 1000 square miles in\r\narea, and containing a population of 100,000. The beautiful yellow\r\npearls shared with the many acts of piracy in attracting attention to\r\nthis group previous to 1878, when the islands were brought under the\r\ninfluence of Spanish rule; and since the Spanish-American War, pearl\r\nfishing has been the leading industry, though it has received less\r\nattention from outside sources, perhaps, than has the existence of\r\nslavery and harems as part of the social system.\r\n\r\nWriting in 1820, John Crawfurd stated that the annual export of pearls\r\nfrom Sulu Islands to China approximated 25,000 Spanish dollars in value,\r\nand the mother-of-pearl similarly exported was worth 70,000 dollars.\r\n“Considering the turbulent and piratical habits of the natives of the\r\nSulu group, it is certain that a greater share of skill and industry\r\nthan can at present be applied to the fisheries, would greatly enhance\r\nthe value and amount of their produce.”[266]\r\n\r\nIn the Sulu Archipelago, the pearl-oyster reefs exist from Sibǔtu Pass\r\nto Basilan Strait, and roughly cover an estimated area of 15,000 square\r\nmiles; that is, in the most favorable localities throughout this area,\r\npearl-oysters occur to a greater or less extent. The fisheries are\r\nprosecuted by Malays and Chinese, and are largely centered at Sulu.\r\n\r\nPearl-oysters occur about many other islands. They exist at Maimbun and\r\nParong; and also off the island of Tapul and its neighbor Lagos, both\r\nsouthwest of Maimbun. In the channels among these islands, on the rocky\r\ngravelly bottom where there is a good current, oysters are commonly\r\nfound. They also occur off Laminusa, northeast of Tawi-Tawi, at Cuyo\r\nIsland, and in the waters about Malampaya and Bacuit.\r\n\r\nThe large mother-of-pearl oyster (_Margaritifera maxima_) known locally\r\nas _concha de nacr_, is by far the most abundant. When full-grown in\r\nthis region it is ordinarily between ten and thirteen inches in\r\ndiameter. The young oyster attaches itself to the bottom by means of the\r\ngreen byssus; but after attaining a weight of one pound, it is too heavy\r\nto be easily moved by the tide, and the ligature gradually disappears.\r\nThe Australian “black lip” (_Margaritifera margaritifera_), known here\r\nas _concha de nagra_, is also found. In these waters it attains a\r\ndiameter of about eight inches, but most specimens are considerably\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nThere is another pearly shell in the Philippines, a spiral gasteropod\r\nknown locally as _caracoles_, which is ordinarily five or six inches in\r\ndiameter, and has a beautiful pearly surface. This yields very few\r\npearls; it is sought for pearl-button manufacture, selling for about the\r\nsame as the _concha de nagra_.\r\n\r\nStreeter states that it is declared by the natives of the Sulu\r\nArchipelago that pearls of a yellowish hue have been found in the pearly\r\nnautilus (_Nautilus pompilius_), one of the group of cephalopodous\r\nmollusks. As, however, there is a superstition that they bring ill luck,\r\nthe natives say that they throw them away, believing that any one who\r\nshould fight while wearing one of these pearls in a ring, would\r\ncertainly be killed. If we consider the habits and organism of this\r\nremarkable animal, and the splendid nacreous coating of its shell, the\r\nassertion that pearls are found in it seems quite natural. Indeed, the\r\noccurrence of pearls in the pearly nautilus is generally recognized.\r\n\r\nFor many years the successive sultans of Sulu exercised authority over\r\nthe fisheries and—in addition to exacting certain percentages and\r\npresents from the fishermen—claimed as their perquisites all pearls\r\nexceeding a designated weight. The fisheries were prosecuted by nude\r\ndivers, of whom there were a large number. A Chinese company had been\r\nparticularly fortunate in its relations with the Sulus, and had an\r\nextensive equipment in the fishery, consisting of a number of small\r\nvessels, each carrying a crew of seven men, who used diving-suits. In\r\naddition to these, some of the native Moros owned boats from which\r\ndiving-suits were employed.\r\n\r\nFollowing the Spanish-American War and the transfer of the Philippine\r\nIslands to America, several vessels proceeded to engage in the fisheries\r\nwithout previously consulting the representatives of the Sultan of Sulu.\r\nThis called forth from that official an appeal to the American\r\nauthorities for protection in his claims. He gave an account of the\r\npearl fishery in this interesting document, which we quote at\r\nlength—through the courtesy of the American Bureau of Insular\r\nAffairs—because of the light it throws, not only on the industry, but\r\nalso on the characteristics of these people with whom the American\r\ngovernment is now dealing.\r\n\r\n\r\n  STATEMENT MADE BY THE SULTAN OF SULU RELATIVE TO THE PEARL FISHERIES\r\n\r\n             (Forwarded by the Governor of Moro Province.)\r\n\r\n  [Translation.]\r\n\r\n                                                 (SEAL of the SULTAN.)\r\n                                                       No date.\r\n\r\n  I beg to inform my father, the civil governor, Major Scott, as you\r\n  want to know about the mother-of-pearl shell, why it is the right of\r\n  all Sulu people, above all my own right, this is the reason:\r\n\r\n  The forefathers of the Sulu people used to take the mother-of-pearl\r\n  shell from the downs because the mother-of-pearl shell belonged to\r\n  the downs, and they took them to eat the oyster with other food; of\r\n  the shell they made plates and saucers to put the food on, and the\r\n  pearls they used to make a hole through and put them on a string as\r\n  necklaces for their children. This was at a time when no other\r\n  nation had come to Sulu to buy the mother-of-pearl shell.\r\n\r\n  Later, a big boat, called the _Sampang_, wandered from China to\r\n  Sulu; there were on board many people, all Chinese; it was loaded\r\n  with merchandise. The people came ashore and saw the mother-of-pearl\r\n  shell which the Sulu people were carrying. The captain of the boat\r\n  said: “Have you many more of these things?” and the people answered,\r\n  “Plenty; this is what we take from the downs to eat with other\r\n  food.” The Captain said. “Gather me plenty. I will buy them from\r\n  you.” The people went and gathered them and bartered them for plates\r\n  and saucers. When all the shells from the downs were finished they\r\n  looked into the deep, and that is how they found the pearling\r\n  grounds, and the people noted them, and remembered them. This is\r\n  what they agreed upon; whoever finds pearling grounds they belong to\r\n  him from generation to generation. That is what they agreed upon.\r\n  That is the reason why the Sulu people have the right, and that they\r\n  came to make the dredge (_badja_) to get the mother-of-pearl shell\r\n  from the deep, because they can not see them.\r\n\r\n  Later Salips came from Mecca of the Arab nation; they came to Sulu\r\n  to convert the people into Mohammedans, as they had no religion. And\r\n  when the Sulu people, including the islanders, adopted the faith,\r\n  then they agreed to have a sultan and they elected Saripul Hassim to\r\n  be sultan. Saripul Hassim said: “I don’t want you to make me your\r\n  sultan if I do not know what the rights of the sultan are, and who I\r\n  have to govern over, because this is not my country, this is your\r\n  country.”\r\n\r\n  And this is how everybody agreed to accept him as sultan over Sulu\r\n  and all the islands; this is how he became Sultan and governed over\r\n  all, and this is how Saripul Hassim accepted to be the sultan of\r\n  Sulu, to have full power over land and sea, and the people’s rights,\r\n  where they got their living from on land and sea, were left to them,\r\n  because they were the means of their getting their livelihood.\r\n\r\n  But a law was made, if they found valuables in the sea, such as\r\n  pearls, tortoise shell, ambal or anything extraordinary, they have\r\n  to show it to the sultan, and if the pearls weigh six chuchuk or\r\n  over they become the share of the sultan; if they do not have that\r\n  weight, the people can do with them as they please and sell them. If\r\n  the sultan wants them, he will buy them according to custom. As to\r\n  tortoise shell, if they weigh two ketties, they go to the sultan,\r\n  and as to the ambal, whether it is much or little, it falls to the\r\n  sultan. Whoever finds it must take it to the sultan. Whoever of his\r\n  subjects violates this law as agreed upon, the sultan can punish him\r\n  as he pleases.\r\n\r\n  They accepted this law as agreed upon, to be carried out by them\r\n  (sultan and people), and their descendants, and not to be changed;\r\n  but they asked of the sultan not to let any other nation take a\r\n  share in this industry; it is enough for them; and the sultan agreed\r\n  to this because they did not know how to earn their living\r\n  otherwise. This is what the sultan and his subjects agreed to\r\n  because the Sulu had no other treasures on land beyond the\r\n  cultivation; the treasures came from the sea only, therefore other\r\n  people are forbidden because this is the property of all my\r\n  subjects, and especially my own.\r\n\r\n  Recently, in my time and in the Spanish time, there came to me\r\n  Captain Tiana; he wanted to dive for pearl shells. I said “I cannot\r\n  give you my consent at once because since our forefathers (sultan\r\n  and people) we have an agreement, I will confer with my people.” I\r\n  sent for the chiefs and the dattos and I told them about it, that\r\n  Captain Tiana came to me and asked to dive for pearl shells. They\r\n  said it cannot be done, because there is an agreement between our\r\n  forefathers that other nations cannot join in this industry of the\r\n  Sulu seas, because there is no other means of earning a living for\r\n  your subjects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Moro boats, used among the pearl islands of the Malay Archipelago\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Raft used for pearl fishing in the Malay Archipelago\r\n]\r\n\r\n  I informed Captain Tiana of it. He said: “Allow me to dive for pearl\r\n  shells, I will give toll to you as sultan and I will also give toll\r\n  to the owners of the pearl grounds according to what we agree upon.”\r\n\r\n  So I informed all the owners of the pearling ground, and they said,\r\n  “If he is really in earnest to give toll to us owners of the ground\r\n  according to what we agree upon, if we don’t agree, we will not\r\n  allow him to fish.” Thereupon Captain Tiana and I went to the\r\n  Spanish governor to bear witness. The governor said: “All right;\r\n  anything you agree upon; I cannot change the law of the Moro people,\r\n  and I will not interfere.”\r\n\r\n  That is how I allowed Captain Tiana to fish, and I gave him a letter\r\n  of the truth according to agreement. Therefore if any person of\r\n  other nation wants to fish for mother-of-pearl shell, he will have\r\n  to do as Captain Tiana did, and ask me for a letter of truth, and if\r\n  he has no letter and does not pay toll to the owners of the ground,\r\n  and especially to me, he cannot dive, and if he violates this and if\r\n  anything befalls him, I am not responsible and do not want to be\r\n  held responsible, because the mother-of-pearl shells are like the\r\n  property in our boxes given to us by God. They do not go away from\r\n  the places where they are put, they are not like fish that go about.\r\n  Therefore, we forbid it. It is our heritage from our forefathers.\r\n\r\n                                  (Signed) HADJI MOHAMAD JAMAUL KIRAM,\r\n                                                      Sultan of Sulu.\r\n\r\n  [SEAL OF THE SULTAN.]\r\n\r\nFollowing these representations, the legislative council of the Moro\r\nprovince, by authority of the Philippine Commission, interdicted all\r\nfishing for pearl-oysters within three marine leagues of any land within\r\nthe territorial limits of the Moro province, without license first\r\nobtained from the treasurer of the district within which the vessel\r\ncarries on the major part of its operations.[267] No license was to be\r\nissued to any vessel not owned in the Philippine Islands or in the\r\nUnited States, and not wholly owned by citizens of the United States, by\r\nnatives of the Philippine Islands, or by persons who have acquired the\r\npolitical rights of natives,[268] except that foreign vessels which for\r\none year immediately preceding had actually engaged in pearl fishing\r\nmight secure license to continue therein for a period of five years\r\nthereafter.\r\n\r\nLicenses were of two kinds, according to the nature of the fishery. To\r\nengage in fishing with the aid of diving-suits, the fee was five hundred\r\npesos annually, for each of the greatest number of divers beneath the\r\nsurface of the water at any one time. For fishing without submarine\r\narmor, the fee was five pesos annually, for each of the greatest number\r\nof nude divers to be employed by the vessel during any voyage, and the\r\nsame sum for each of the greatest number of dredges or rakes to be\r\nemployed beneath the surface at any one time; but this did not apply to\r\nvessels under 15 tons, owned and operated wholly by native Moros, until\r\nJanuary 1, 1906.\r\n\r\nIt was also made unlawful to catch or to have in one’s possession within\r\nthe Moro province “any pearl shell or any bivalvular or lateral plate,\r\nor any pearl shell of less than 4½ inches in diameter, measured with a\r\nflat, rigid measuring rod along the line of the ligament which joins one\r\nbinocular or lateral plate to the other at the hinge, unless the lateral\r\nplate of such shell be more than 7 inches in diameter measured with a\r\nflat, rigid measuring rod from the outer edge of the horny lips to the\r\ncenter of the hinge, the rod being so placed as to form a right angle\r\nwith the line of the hinge.”[269]\r\n\r\nAccording to a report furnished by the Mining Bureau at Manila, there\r\nwere seven vessels fishing with diving-suits in the Sulu Archipelago in\r\n1905, each representing an investment of about 6000 pesos. In 1906 there\r\nwere ten vessels engaged in this industry, and the collection on\r\nlicenses for that fiscal year amounted to 3375 pesos. These vessels are\r\nmostly small Moro craft which cannot venture upon distant cruises in the\r\narchipelago for prospecting purposes, and their operations are confined\r\nfor the most part to the immediate vicinity of Jolo. Each vessel carries\r\none diver, a tender, a cook, and four sailors. In addition to food\r\nsupplies, the sailors and the cook each receive twelve to fifteen pesos\r\nper month, the tender thirty to forty pesos per month, and the diver the\r\nsame amount and in addition thereto a bonus of twenty cents for each\r\nshell secured. Near Jolo the vessels work throughout the year, but\r\nfarther north very little fishing is done from December to April, when\r\nmonsoons prevail. The man in charge of each vessel is obliged by law to\r\nkeep an accurate record of the number and weight of shells found, and\r\nhis figures are checked up by a customs official at either Jolo or\r\nZamboanga, the ports of discharge.\r\n\r\nTo enable them to secure pearl-oysters at depths of from twenty to forty\r\nfathoms, the Sulus have long made use of a dredge (_badja_) peculiarly\r\nconstructed of native materials, and admirably adapted to the purpose.\r\nThis consists of five or more long wooden teeth slightly curved and\r\nspreading outward, with an expanse at the ends of twenty inches or more.\r\nThe dredge is properly balanced by two stones, and a bridle rope is so\r\nattached to it that, when thrown overboard and towed behind a canoe\r\ndrifting with the current or the wind, the implement rests on the curve\r\nof the teeth, which are in almost a horizontal position. As the teeth\r\nenter the gaping shell of an oyster lying on the bottom, the animal\r\ninstantly closes tightly on the intruder and effects its own capture.\r\nThe principle is similar to that of the “crowfoot” dredge of the\r\nMississippi River, although the design of the implement is radically\r\ndifferent. A second rope is attached so as to raise and lower the\r\nimplement and to detach it from corals, rocks, and other objects against\r\nwhich it may catch in its course on the bottom. This dredge is designed\r\nfor very deep areas, where the bottom is relatively smooth.\r\n\r\nThe Moros employ yet another method of fishing, using a _magtung-tung_\r\nor three-pronged catcher, which is let down by a rattan rope and by\r\nmeans of which individual shells sighted from the surface are obtained.\r\nWhen the water is perfectly clear this implement can be operated where\r\nthe depth is fifteen or eighteen fathoms, but its use is impractical\r\nwhere the water is clouded or there is even a slight ripple on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nHowever, the bulk of the catch is made by the nude divers, of which\r\nthere are hundreds at Maimbun, Tapul, Lugus and elsewhere. In their\r\nsmall boats these Moro fishermen visit the reefs, where the boats are\r\nanchored. Provided only with a short, heavy knife, with which to release\r\nthe shells from the bottom or, perchance, as a weapon of defense against\r\nsharks and other fish, they enter the water feet first, but soon turn\r\nand descend head downward, precisely as on the Australian coast,\r\nswimming toward the bottom with bold strokes. The Sulu pearl-divers—and\r\nespecially those at Parang, Patian and Sicubun—are among the most expert\r\nin the world. They easily penetrate to twelve fathoms and, if necessary,\r\nto eighteen or twenty fathoms. But they are not very industrious, and\r\nseldom descend more than twelve or fifteen times a day, preferring\r\nrather to go with their wants half satisfied than to satiate them by\r\nmore active exertions.\r\n\r\nMany descents may be necessary to locate and obtain a single oyster, but\r\nwhen this is secured the shell alone may ordinarily be traded for\r\nsufficient to supply the fisherman’s needs for several days, and there\r\nis always the chance of a pearl. After a short day of labor, the\r\nfishermen return, and the oysters which they have secured are opened and\r\nexamined for pearls. After the flesh has been carefully searched it is\r\nplaced in the sun to dry and, later, to be used for food, and the shells\r\nare carefully cleaned and placed under cover until they may be bartered\r\nor sold.\r\n\r\nThe Sulu shell is characterized by a peculiar yellowish tint around the\r\nrim, by means of which it is readily distinguished. Its size and\r\nbeautiful iridescence make it very attractive, and for choice individual\r\nspecimens high prices are received. It is the largest of the\r\nmother-of-pearl shells, single half-shells of “bold” size average one\r\nand one half pounds in weight, while some attain a weight of six pounds.\r\nThe body of the shell furnishes the most beautiful of all\r\nmother-of-pearl, yet the necessity for discarding the yellow rim, or,\r\nrather, for using it separate from the rest, makes it unpopular with\r\nmanufacturers. The annual product is estimated at 200 tons, valued in\r\nLondon and New York at $200,000, and of pearls about $30,000 worth.\r\n\r\nThe Sulu pearls are frequently large and of choice quality, but they are\r\nfar more inclined to a yellowish tint than those from Australian waters,\r\n1300 miles southward. The sultans accumulated the finest collection of\r\nthem, and some of these found their way into the markets from time to\r\ntime as the condition of the exchequer ran low or royal emergency\r\nrequired, as in 1882, for instance, when it was necessary to defray the\r\nexpense of Sultan Buderoodin’s pilgrimage to Mecca. During the last six\r\nor seven years, much has been heard of the present sultan’s collection,\r\nwhich he largely inherited, and some fairly good specimens have been\r\npresented to prominent Americans.\r\n\r\nPearl-oysters are among the important resources of the inshore waters of\r\nthe Dutch East Indies, including the surrounding seas of Sumatra, Java,\r\nBorneo, Celebes, the Aru Islands, the Moluccas or Spice Islands, and\r\nPapua or New Guinea. For very many years the natives have gathered pearl\r\nshell and pearls from these waters, and especially on the coast of the\r\nAru Islands, at Gilolo or Halmahera, and the islands thereabout, on the\r\neast coast of Celebes, and about the Sunda group. The collections were\r\nmade in the shallow waters by beach-combing and by nude diving, and were\r\nbartered with the Chinese and Arab traders sailing from Singapore,\r\nMacassar, and other ports. Occasionally a pearling vessel from Singapore\r\nor from Torres Straits would try its luck in these waters; but, except\r\nfor the work of the natives, the reefs were practically untouched\r\nprevious to 1883.\r\n\r\nAs the Australian fleet increased in size and the oysters became scarce\r\nin Torres Straits and on the northwest coast, some of the vessels\r\noccasionally visited the Aru Islands, the coast of Papua, etc. These met\r\nwith considerable success and the number of trips increased, especially\r\nin 1893, when oysters were unusually scarce in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1894, the government restricted the fishery to\r\ninhabitants of the Netherlands and of Netherlands India, or to companies\r\nestablished in those countries and operating under the Dutch flag. Owing\r\nto the activity of Dutch capital in coffee, tobacco and other plantation\r\nenterprises, the pearl resources received very little attention from\r\nthem. The success of the Australian fishery encouraged the formation in\r\n1896 of an Amsterdam company to exploit the Aru grounds; but apparently\r\nwithout financial success, for it liquidated in 1898.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pearling village, with youthful fishermen. Sulu Islands\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Japanese diver in Dutch East Indies, come up to “blow” for a few\r\n    minutes\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, residents of these islands paid more and more attention\r\nto the pearl fishery; also Europeans, Chinamen and Arabs arranged with\r\nthe native chiefs for fishing in their territorial waters, paying\r\ntherefor a fixed sum in cash or a percentage of the catch, which was\r\npermitted on approval by the governor-general of Dutch India. The fleet\r\ncontinued to increase from year to year, and in 1905 there was a very\r\nlarge influx of vessels from the Australian fisheries, 110 luggers and 7\r\ntenders coming from Thursday Island alone.\r\n\r\nThe species are the same as occur on the northern coast of Australia,\r\nthe “silver edge” or “golden lip” (_Margaritifera maxima_) occurring in\r\ngreatest abundance, and the “black lip” (_M. margaritifera_) to a less\r\nextent.\r\n\r\nThe shells are the principal object of the search, and the pearls found\r\nincidentally form an additional source of revenue. These shells divide\r\nwith those of Australia the reputation of being the most valuable in the\r\nworld. They are commonly known in the trade by the name of the port from\r\nwhich they are originally shipped, as Manila, Macassar, Banda, Ceram,\r\nPenang, Mergui, etc. Before the exploitation of the Australian grounds,\r\nthey sold at very high prices, and $2000 or more per ton was sometimes\r\nrealized for those of the best quality. Singapore is the headquarters\r\nfor supplies for the industry in all this region, and it is from that\r\nport that the shells and pearls are mostly distributed.\r\n\r\nThe pearls obtained in Netherlands India are of choice quality and of\r\nrelatively large size, a considerable percentage of them weighing over\r\neight grains, and fairly good pearls of fifty grains or more are\r\noccasionally reported. Colored pearls are rarely met with, nearly all of\r\nthem being clear white, like the beautiful Macassar shell.\r\n\r\nAt Pados Bay, island of Borneo, one hundred or more persons find\r\nemployment fishing the Placuna oysters, selling the shells for about $2\r\nper picul (139 pounds to the picul), the dried meats at $4 to $6 a\r\npicul, and the seed-pearls (_seleesip_) at about $2 per mayam. Many of\r\nthese pearls are sold in the village of Batu Batu. When a fisherman buys\r\nhis few necessaries at the Chinese shops, he pulls out his little\r\npackage of seed-pearls and pays in that currency, the Chinaman making a\r\ngood profit by the transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n\r\n                            AMERICAN PEARLS\r\n\r\n    VENEZUELA, PANAMA, MEXICO, AMERICAN FRESH WATERS, MISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n                      PEARL FISHERIES OF VENEZUELA\r\n\r\n\r\n  When I discovered the Indies, I said that they composed the richest\r\n  country in the world. I spake of gold and pearls and precious\r\n  stones, and the traffic that might be carried on in them.\r\n\r\n                                Extract from Columbus’s Fourth Letter.\r\n\r\nThe Caribbean Sea furnishes one of the most interesting chapters in the\r\nhistory of the pearl fisheries. In no region of the world have these\r\nresources caused more rapid exploitation or affected the inhabitants to\r\na greater extent than on the shores of Venezuela.\r\n\r\nBefore the discovery of America, the natives of this region collected\r\npearls from the mollusks which they opened for food in times of\r\nnecessity, and also sought them for ornamental purposes. And although\r\nthey had large collections which they used for personal ornamentation\r\nand for decorating their temples, it does not appear that they prized\r\nthem extravagantly, readily bartering them for small returns.\r\n\r\nIn Columbus’s account of his third and fourth voyages to America, he\r\nrepeatedly refers to pearls. On the third voyage, in 1498, after passing\r\nthe mouth of the Orinoco River, he entered the Gulf of Paria, where the\r\nnatives “came to the ship in their canoes in countless numbers, many of\r\nthem wearing pieces of gold on their breasts, and some with bracelets of\r\npearls on their arms; seeing this I was much delighted and made many\r\ninquiries with the view of learning where they found them. They replied\r\nthat they were to be procured in their own neighborhood and also at a\r\nspot to the northward of that place. I would have remained here, but the\r\nprovisions of corn, and wine, and meats, which I had brought out with so\r\nmuch care for the people whom I had left behind, were nearly wasted, so\r\nthat all my anxiety was to get them into a place of safety, and not to\r\nstop for anything. I wished, however, to get some of the pearls that I\r\nhad seen, and with that view sent the boats on shore. I inquired there\r\nalso where the pearls were obtained. And they likewise directed me to\r\nthe westward and also to the north behind the country they occupied. I\r\ndid not put this information to the test, on account of the provisions\r\nand the weakness of my eyes and because the ship was not calculated for\r\nsuch an undertaking.”\r\n\r\nIn his letter to one of the queen’s attendants, written in 1500,\r\nColumbus says, in justification of his conduct toward his miserable\r\ndetractors: “I believed that the voyage to Paria would in some degree\r\npacify them because of the pearls and the discovery of gold in the\r\nisland of Española. I left orders for the people to fish for pearls, and\r\ncalled them together and made an agreement that I should return for\r\nthem, and I was given to understand that the supply would be abundant.”\r\n\r\nAnd again in the same letter, after speaking of a quantity of gold which\r\nmysteriously disappeared when Governor Bobadilla sent him and his\r\nbrothers loaded with chains to Spain, he says: “I have been yet more\r\nconcerned respecting the affair of the pearls, that I have not brought\r\nthem to their Majesties.... Already the road is opened to gold and\r\npearls, and it may surely be hoped that precious stones, spices, and a\r\nthousand other things will also be found.”\r\n\r\nA more detailed account of Columbus’s pearling adventures, and of the\r\nsubsequent discoveries and explorations on the Caribbean coast is given\r\nby Francisco Lopez de Gomara in his “Historia general de las Indias,”\r\npublished in 1554, of which the following is a literal translation\r\nslightly abridged:\r\n\r\n  Since there are pearls on more than four hundred leagues of this\r\n  coast between Cape Vela and the Gulf of Paria, before we proceed\r\n  farther it is proper to say who discovered them. In the third voyage\r\n  made by Christopher Columbus to the Indies, in 1498, having reached\r\n  the island of Cubagua, which he called “Isle of Pearls,” he sent a\r\n  boat with certain sailors to seize a boat of fishermen, to learn\r\n  what people they were and for what they were fishing. The sailors\r\n  reached the shore where the Indians had landed and were watching. A\r\n  sailor broke a dish of Malaga ware and went to trade with them and\r\n  to look at their catch, because he saw a woman with a string of\r\n  rough pearls (_aljofar_) on her neck. He made an exchange of the\r\n  plate for some strings of rough pearls, white and large, with which\r\n  the sailors returned highly delighted to the ships. To assure\r\n  himself better, Columbus ordered others to go with buttons, needles,\r\n  scissors, and fragments of the same Valencian earthenware, since\r\n  they seemed to prize it. These sailors went and brought back more\r\n  than six marcs (forty-eight ounces) of rough pearls, large and\r\n  small, with many good pearls among them. Said Columbus then to the\r\n  Spaniards: “We are in the richest country of the world. Let us give\r\n  thanks to the Lord.” They wondered at seeing all those rough pearls\r\n  so large, for they had never seen so many, and could not contain\r\n  their delight. They understood that the Indians did not care much\r\n  for the small ones, either because they had plenty of large ones, or\r\n  because they did not know how to pierce them.\r\n\r\n  Columbus left the island and approached the land, where many people\r\n  had collected along the shore, to see if they also had pearls. The\r\n  shore was covered with men, women, and children, who came to look at\r\n  the ships, a strange thing for them. Many Indians presently visited\r\n  the ships, went on board and stood amazed at the dress, swords, and\r\n  beards of the Spaniards, and the cannon, tackle, and arms of the\r\n  ship. Our people crossed themselves, and were delighted to see that\r\n  all those Indians wore pearls on their necks and wrists. Columbus\r\n  asked by signs where they fished them, and they pointed to the coast\r\n  and island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Venezuela and Panama; the principal pearling regions of South\r\n    America\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Columbus then sent to the shore two boats with many Spaniards, for\r\n  greater certainty of those new riches, and because they importuned\r\n  him. The chief took them to a place where there was a circular\r\n  building that resembled a temple, where presently much bread and\r\n  fruits of different kinds were brought. At the end of the feast he\r\n  gave them pearls for sweetmeats, and took them afterward to the\r\n  palace to see the women and the arrangement of the house. Of the\r\n  numerous women there, not one was without rings of gold and\r\n  necklaces of pearls. The Spaniards returned to the ships, wandering\r\n  at such pearls and gold, and requested Columbus to leave them there.\r\n  But he did not wish to do so, saying they were too few to settle. He\r\n  hoisted sail and ran along the coast as far as Cape Vela, and from\r\n  there came to Santo Domingo, with the intention of returning to\r\n  Cubagua after regulating the affairs of the government. He\r\n  suppressed the joy he felt at having found such treasures, and did\r\n  not write to the king regarding the discovery of pearls, or at all\r\n  events did not write it until it was already known in Castile. This\r\n  was largely the cause for the anger of the king, and the order to\r\n  bring Columbus a prisoner to Spain. They say that he did not so much\r\n  intend to conceal this discovery from the king, who has many eyes,\r\n  as that he thought by a new agreement to get this rich island for\r\n  himself.\r\n\r\n  Of the sailors who went with Christopher Columbus when he found the\r\n  pearls, the greater number were from Palos. As soon as these came to\r\n  Spain, they told about the country of pearls, displayed many, and\r\n  carried them to Seville to sell, whence they went to the court and\r\n  into the palace. Excited by this report, some persons there\r\n  hurriedly prepared a ship and made Pedro Alonso Niño its captain. He\r\n  had from the Catholic king license to go in search of pearls and\r\n  land, provided he should not go within fifty leagues of any\r\n  discovered by Columbus.\r\n\r\n  Niño embarked in August, 1499, with thirty-three companions, some of\r\n  whom had been with Columbus. He sailed as far as Paria, visited the\r\n  coast of Cumana, Maracapan, Port Plechado, and Curiana, which lies\r\n  united to Venezuela. There he landed, and a chief, who came to the\r\n  coast with fifty Indians, conducted him amicably to a large town to\r\n  take water, refreshments, and the barter he was in search of. He\r\n  bartered for and secured fifteen ounces of pearls in exchange for\r\n  pins, rings of horn and tin, glass beads, small bells, and similar\r\n  trifles. The Spaniards stayed in the town twenty days, trading for\r\n  pearls. The natives gave a pigeon for a needle, a turtledove for one\r\n  glass bead, a pheasant for two, and a turkey for four. For that\r\n  price they also gave rabbits and quarters of deer. The Indians asked\r\n  to be shown the use of needles, since they went naked and could not\r\n  sew, and were told to extract the thorns with them, for they went\r\n  barefooted: Niño brought to Galicia ninety-six pounds of rough\r\n  pearls, among which were many fine, round, lustrous ones of five and\r\n  six carats, and some of more. But they were not well pierced, which\r\n  was a great fault. On the route a quarrel arose over the division,\r\n  and certain sailors accused Niño before the governor in Galicia,\r\n  saying that he had stolen many pearls and cheated the king in his\r\n  fifth, and traded in Cumana and other places where Columbus had\r\n  been. The governor seized Niño, but did not keep him in prison very\r\n  long, where he consumed pearls enough.[270]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRAY PEARLS FROM LOWER CALIFORNIA, AND DIAMONDS\r\n\r\n  Pan-American Exposition, 1901\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis expedition of Pedro Alonso Niño was the first financially\r\nprofitable voyage to America. After his return, the Cubagua pearl\r\nfishery became the object of numerous speculations, and many other\r\nSpaniards fitted out voyages, most of them sailing from Hispaniola or\r\nHaiti, nine hundred miles distant. Owing to the ill-treatment of the\r\nIndians and excessive cruelties toward them, much difficulty was\r\nexperienced in securing divers. This was relieved in 1508 by\r\ntransporting large numbers of Indians from the Lucayan or Bahama Islands\r\nand impressing them into the service. These were so expert in the work\r\nthat individuals sold for upward of 150 ducats each.[271] With their aid\r\nthe fishery prospered so greatly that in 1515 a settlement, called New\r\nCadiz, was established on Cubagua Island by the governor of Hispaniola,\r\nDiego Columbus, son of the discoverer. This small island was dry and\r\ndesolate, without water or wood, which were brought from the mainland\r\ntwenty miles distant, or from Margarita Island about three miles to the\r\nnorthward.\r\n\r\nAn interesting description of the manner of securing the pearls by these\r\nearly adventurers was given by Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdes\r\n(1478–1557) in his “Historia natural y general de las Indias,” written\r\nless than thirty years after the discovery of the mainland of America. A\r\ntranslation of this book was published in 1555 by Richard Eden in his\r\n“Decades of the New World”; from which we extract the following account,\r\nthe retention of Eden’s quaint phraseology seeming permissible owing to\r\nthis being one of the very earliest books on America.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _Of the maner of fyshynge for perles_\r\n\r\n  The Indians exercise this kynde of fyschynge for the moste parte in\r\n  the coastes of the North in _Cubagua_ and _Cumana_. And manye of\r\n  theym which dwell in the houses of certeyne particular lordes in the\r\n  Ilandes of _San Dominico_ and _Sancti Iohannis_, resort to the\r\n  Ilande of _Cubagua_ for this purpose. Theyr custome is to go fyve,\r\n  syxe, or seven, or more in one of theyr _Canoas_ or barkes erly in\r\n  the mornynge to sume place in the sea there about where it appeareth\r\n  unto them that there shulde bee greate plentie of those shell fyshes\r\n  (which sume caule muscles and sume oysters) wherein perles are\r\n  engendered. And there they plonge them selves under the water, even\r\n  unto the bottome, savynge one that remaynethe in the Canoa or boate\r\n  which he keepeth styll in one place as neare as he can, lookynge for\r\n  theyr returne owte of the water. And when one of them hath byn a\r\n  good whyle under the water, he ryseth up and commeth swymmynge to\r\n  the boate, enterynge into the same, and leavynge there all the\r\n  oysters whiche he hath taken and brought with hym. For in these, are\r\n  the perles founde. And when he hathe there rested hym selfe a whyle,\r\n  and eaten parte of the oysters, he returneth ageyne to the water,\r\n  where he remaynethe as longe as he can endure, and then ryseth\r\n  ageyne, and swimmeth to the boate with his pray, where he resteth\r\n  hym as before, and thus continueth course by course, as doo all the\r\n  other in lyke maner, being all moste experte swymmers and dyvers.\r\n  And when the nyght draweth neare, they returne to the Ilande to\r\n  theyr houses, and presente all the oysters to the master or stewarde\r\n  of the house of theyr lorde who hath charge of the sayde Indians.\r\n  And when he hath gyven them sumwhat to eate, he layeth up the\r\n  oysters in safe custodie untyll he have a great quantitie thereof.\r\n  Then hee causeth the same fyssher men to open them. And they fynde\r\n  in every of them pearles other great or smaul, two or three or\r\n  foure, and sumtymes five and syxe, and many smaule graines accordyng\r\n  to the lyberalitie of nature. They save the pearles bothe smaule and\r\n  great whiche they have founde: And eyther eate the oysters if they\r\n  wyl, or caste them away, havynge so great quantitie thereof that\r\n  they in maner abhorre them. Those oysters are of hard fleshe, and\r\n  not so pleasant in eatyng as are owres of Spayne. This Ilande of\r\n  _Cubagua_ where this manner of fysching is exercised, is in the\r\n  Northe coaste, and is no bygger then the Iland of Zelande.\r\n  Oftentymes the sea encreaseth greatly, and muche more then the\r\n  fyshers for pearles wold, bycause where as the place is very depe, a\r\n  man can not naturally rest at the bottome by reason of the\r\n  aboundaunce of aery substannce whiche is in hym, as I have\r\n  oftentymes proved. For althoughe he may by vyolence and force\r\n  descende to the bottome, yet are his feete lyfted up ageyne so that\r\n  he can continue no tyme there. And therefore where the sea is verye\r\n  deepe, these Indian fyshers use to tye two great stoones aboute them\r\n  with a corde, on every side one, by the weyght whereof they descend\r\n  to the bottome and remayne there untyl them lysteth to ryse ageine:\r\n  At which tyme they unlose the stones, and ryse uppe at their\r\n  pleasure. But this their aptenesse and agilitie in swimming, is not\r\n  the thynge that causeth men moste to marvaile: But rather to\r\n  consyder how many of them can stande in the bottome of the water for\r\n  the space of one hole houre and summe more or lesse, accordynge as\r\n  one is more apte hereunto then an other. An other thynge there is\r\n  whiche seemeth to me very straunge. And this is, that where as I\r\n  have oftentymes demaunded of summe of these lordes of the Indians,\r\n  if the place where they accustomed to fysche for pearles beynge but\r\n  lyttle and narrowe wyll not in shorte tyme bee utterly without\r\n  oysters if they consume them so faste, they al answered me, that\r\n  although they be consumed in one parte, yet if they go a fyschynge\r\n  in an other parte or on another coaste of the Ilande, or at an other\r\n  contrary wynd, and continue fysshing there also untyll the oysters\r\n  be lykewyse consumed, and then returne ageyne to the fyrste place,\r\n  or any other place where they fysshed before and emptied the same in\r\n  lyke maner, they find them ageine as ful of oysters as though they\r\n  had never bin fysshed. Wherby we may judge that these oysters eyther\r\n  remove from one place to an other as do other fysshes, or elles that\r\n  they are engendered and encrease in certeyne ordinaire places. This\r\n  Iland of _Cumana_ and _Cubagua_ where they fyshe for these perles,\r\n  is in the twelfe degree of the part of the said coaste which\r\n  inclineth toward the North.\r\n\r\nThe cupidity of the proprietors of the fishery led to most cruel\r\ntreatment of the divers and, if the accounts of the time are to be\r\nrelied upon, a large percentage of them died under the harsh regime.\r\nAbout 1515 the unfortunate natives obtained an earnest and influential\r\nadvocate in Bartolomé de las Casas, who, in 1516, prevailed upon the\r\nyouthful Charles V to decree that the fishery should be prosecuted only\r\nin summer, that the divers should not be required to work more than four\r\nhours a day where the depth exceeded six fathoms, that they should\r\nreceive good nourishment and half a quart of wine daily, should have\r\nhammocks or beds in which to sleep, and should be provided with clothes\r\nto put on as soon as they left the water.[272] And by later ordinances\r\nit was stipulated that death should be inflicted on any one forcing a\r\nfree Indian to dive for pearls.\r\n\r\nIn 1528 the resources of Coche Island were exploited with so much\r\nsuccess that within six months “1500 marcs (12,000 ounces) of pearls”\r\nwere secured. Pearl banks were successively found at Porlamar,\r\nMaracapana, Curiano, and at various places on the coast from the Gulf of\r\nParia to the Gulf of Coro, a distance of over five hundred miles, which\r\nbecame designated the “Pearl Coast.” For a number of years previous to\r\n1530, the output exceeded in value 800,000 piastres annually,\r\napproximating one half the produce of the American mines at that\r\ntime.[273] It was largely these pearls that enriched the cargoes of many\r\nof those famous caravels that crossed the Atlantic to Spain. Indeed, for\r\nseveral decades, America was best known in continental Europe as the\r\nland whence the pearls came.\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of an early effort to use dredges in the Cubagua\r\npearl fishery was given by Girolamo Benzoni, who had lived in America\r\nfrom 1542 to 1555, and was familiar with the conditions. He states:\r\n\r\n  “At the time the pearl fishery flourished on this island there came\r\n  here one Louis de Lampugnan with an imperial license authorizing him\r\n  to fish such quantities of pearls as he pleased within all the\r\n  limits and bounds of Cubagua. This man set out from Spain with four\r\n  caravels loaded with all the necessary provisions and munitions for\r\n  such an enterprise, which some Spanish merchants furnished him. He\r\n  had made a kind of rake, the fashion of which was such that in\r\n  whatever part of the sea it was used, not an oyster would escape. At\r\n  the same time he would have raked and drawn out all that bore pearls\r\n  if he had not been disappointed. But the Spaniards in Cubagua all\r\n  banded against him in the execution of his privilege. They said the\r\n  emperor was too liberal with other people’s goods, and if he wished\r\n  to give he might give his own as he wished. As for themselves they\r\n  had conquered and kept that country with great labor and at the\r\n  peril of their lives, and there were far better reasons why they\r\n  should enjoy it than a stranger. Poor Lampugnan, seeing that his\r\n  patents did not avail him the value of a straw, and at the same time\r\n  not daring to return to Spain, partly through fear of being\r\n  ridiculed and partly on account of the money he owed, was ruined. In\r\n  fact, the business and its anxieties drove him crazy and he was\r\n  exposed to the mockery of all the world as a lunatic. In the end,\r\n  after dragging out five years in this miserable condition, he died\r\n  in this isle of Cubagua.”[274]\r\n\r\nThe average size of these pearls derived from the Venezuelan fisheries\r\nwas small, specimens rarely exceeding twenty grains. In 1577, Urbain\r\nChauveton wrote: “The pearls of Cubagua are mostly 2, 3, 4, and 5\r\ncarats. But the quantity of them is so great that the fifth part which\r\nis paid to the king of Spain yields every year the value of more than\r\n15,000 ducats; this besides the frauds committed and the pearls which\r\nstick to the fingers of those who manage the business, and who pilfer\r\nthe most beautiful in great numbers, sending them here and there for\r\nsale. They place themselves in great danger if the facts become known,\r\nbut they do it all the same.”[275]\r\n\r\nThe enormous demands made by the Spaniards soon had its effect on the\r\nresources, for Chauveton adds: “It is apparent they decrease and not so\r\nmany are found as in the beginning. The reason for this is that the\r\nSpaniards are so eager to gather large quantities of them quickly that\r\nthey are not content to use their divers to search for them in the\r\ndepths of the sea, but they have conceived and invented I know not how\r\nmany machines of rakes and drags to scrape up everything. In fact they\r\nhave at times collected them all so that another could not be found, and\r\nhave had to abandon their fishing for a considerable time to give the\r\noysters a chance to lay their eggs and grow their pearls.”[276]\r\n\r\nThe decrease noted by Chauveton was probably not very serious, for the\r\nSpanish historian, Jose de Acosta, reports that in 1581 he saw “the note\r\nof what came from the Indies for the king; there were 18 marcs of\r\npearles, besides 3 caskets; and for private persons there were 1265\r\nmarcs, and besides them, 7 caskets not pierced, which heretofore we\r\nwould have esteemed and helde for a lie.”[277] Also the records show\r\nthat in 1597 Spain received from the Venezuelan fisheries “350 pounds’\r\nweight of pearls.” It is to be regretted that the Spaniards so\r\nfrequently reported the yield of pearls by pounds’ weight, for—owing to\r\nthe great variation in quality—this is about as unsatisfactory as to\r\nreport the wealth of an individual by the pounds’ weight of his\r\ntitle-deeds or of his stock certificates. The value of “350 pounds of\r\npearls” might have been anywhere from twenty thousand dollars to as many\r\nmillions. Assuming that all were two grains each in weight and of good\r\nquality, the total value would approximate $600,000 according to the\r\nvaluation of that period; and on a basis of eight grains each, it would\r\nbe $9,600,000, or sixteen times as much. But as original parcels of\r\npearls from the fisheries, these figures should be divided by three.\r\n\r\nFollowing 1597, the productiveness of the Cubagua beds rapidly\r\ndecreased. By acts of cruelty and oppression the Spaniards had converted\r\nthe surviving Indians into deadly foes, ready to take advantage of any\r\nopportunity to avenge themselves on their oppressors, and thus\r\nterrifying the settlers into abandoning the enterprise. Early in the\r\nseventeenth century the development of mining resources in Mexico, Peru,\r\netc., attracted the adventurous Spaniards. A considerable decrease in\r\nthe value of pearls, brought about by the skilful manufacture of\r\nimitations at Venice, and elsewhere in southern Europe, also affected\r\nthe prosperity of the fisheries. As a result of these combined\r\ninfluences, the output in Venezuela was greatly reduced, and it ceased\r\nlong before the close of the following century. Thus ended an enterprise\r\nwhich, for a number of years, represented the greatest single industry\r\nof the European people on the American continent.\r\n\r\nAccording to General Manuel Laudecta Rosales, the Venezuela archives\r\ncontain no reference to any renewal of the fishery until early in the\r\nnineteenth century. At the time of Humboldt’s visit in 1799, the fishery\r\nwas entirely neglected around the islands of Margarita, Cubagua, and\r\nCoche, and the only evidence of pearls was a few very insignificant ones\r\npicked up about Cumana and sold among the natives at a piaster per\r\ndozen.[278]\r\n\r\nAfter the overthrow of Spanish authority on this coast, Messrs. Rundell,\r\nBridge and Rundell, a firm of well-known goldsmiths of London, obtained,\r\nin 1823, from the government of Colombia, a ten-year monopoly of the\r\nfishery at several places on the coast of the new republic, in\r\nconsideration of one fifth of the pearls secured.[279] After the\r\nindependence of Venezuela in 1829, the taxes imposed were so heavy that\r\nthe industry languished, and about 1833 it was practically abandoned.\r\n\r\nOwing to the improved physical condition of the reefs, the fishery\r\ndeveloped largely in 1845; and for several years an average of 1600\r\nounces of pearls were secured, an ounce of good quality selling for 150\r\nto 500 bolivars (one bolivar = 19½ cents), and the inferior quality at\r\n80 to 100 bolivars.[280] At that time there was a tax of sixteen\r\nbolivars per boat monthly. In 1853 this was increased to forty-eight\r\nbolivars per boat, and the use of dredges (_arrastras_) was interdicted,\r\nsoon reducing the fishery to a very low stage. Subjected to frequent\r\nchanges in regulations, and burdened by heavy taxes, the industry\r\nremained in poor condition until about 1895. Since then the enhanced\r\nvalue of pearls, and the increased industrial activity on the coast, has\r\nresulted in a very large development of the fishery.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the government of Venezuela has granted concessions to\r\nindividuals and to companies for the exploitation of defined areas for a\r\nlimited period, exacting 10 per cent. royalty on the proceeds of the\r\nenterprise. In granting these concessions, the government usually\r\nreserves the right to examine the books, and to intervene when necessary\r\nin any phase of the enterprise. For protecting its revenue, the\r\ngovernment requires that shipments of the pearls must be signed by its\r\nagent, and bills of sale must be countersigned by the Venezuelan consul\r\nin the place where the sales are consummated.\r\n\r\nThe Venezuelan pearl fishery now gives employment to about 350 boats,\r\nmanned by five or six men each, sailing from the ports of Juan Griego,\r\nCumana, and Carupano. These are sail craft, measuring from two to\r\nfifteen tons each, and are licensed by the Venezuelan authorities at a\r\ncharge of 15 bolivars ($2.92) each. Most of the boats use dredges, but\r\nsome of them resort to nude diving, after the manner of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Attempts have been made to use the scaphander, or diving armor,\r\nbut without success, owing largely to the difficulty in obtaining\r\nexperienced workmen, and also to local prejudice against this form of\r\nfishery. It is claimed that in using the scaphander, all oysters are\r\nremoved from the reefs, whereas the _arrastra_ or dredge spreads the\r\noysters and thereby enlarges the reefs. This is the principal and,\r\nexcept those at Sharks Bay and the Sulu Islands, the only important\r\npearl fishery in which the oysters are secured by means of dredges.\r\nThese are made of iron and are similar to those implements used in the\r\nscallop fisheries of New York and Rhode Island. They are dragged over\r\nthe beds, and when filled are lifted and their contents emptied into the\r\nboat, the fishermen culling out the desirable oysters from the mass and\r\nthrowing the refuse material overboard.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-oyster (_Margaritifera radiata_) secured on the coast of\r\nVenezuela is closely related to the Ceylon species. It averages slightly\r\nlarger in size, and there is a much greater range in coloration. The\r\npearls are of good quality. In color they range from white to bronze,\r\nand occasionally a so-called black one is found. The total output is\r\nvalued locally at about 1,750,000 francs ($350,000) per year. Most of\r\nthem are sold in Paris.\r\n\r\nOwing to their small size and lack of thickness, the shells of the\r\nVenezuela pearl-oyster are of little or no value in the mother-of-pearl\r\ntrade. Thousands of tons of them, the accumulations of scores of\r\nfisheries, lie in heaps and ridges along the coast, as though in years\r\nlong past vast armies of oysters, engaged in deadly combat, had left\r\ntheir innumerable myriads of slain comrades to bleach on the shores.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE PANAMA PEARL FISHERIES\r\n\r\n    The bordring Ilands, seated here in ken,\r\n    Whose Shores are sprinkled with rich Orient Pearle,\r\n    More bright of hew than were the Margarets\r\n    That Caesar found in wealthy Albion.\r\n\r\n                            ROBERT GREENE, _Orlando Furioso_ (1594).\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the Spaniards of his day, the greatest result\r\nof Balboa’s immortal journey in 1513 across the Isthmus of Panama to the\r\nbroad waters of the Pacific, was the discovery of the pearl resources of\r\nthe Gulf of St. Michael, now known as the Gulf of Panama. Probably the\r\nbest description of this is given by Lopez de Gomara in his “Historia\r\ngeneral de las Indias,” published in 1554, from which we translate the\r\nfollowing account.\r\n\r\nAfter Balboa had reached the Pacific in 1513, he proceeded a short\r\ndistance along the coast until he met with an Indian chief by the name\r\nof Tomaco. Being questioned about the gold and pearls which some of his\r\npeople wore, Tomaco sent for some gold and 240 large pearls and a great\r\nnumber of small ones—a rich present, which filled the Spaniards with\r\npleasure. Seeing the Spaniards so delighted, Tomaco ordered some of his\r\nmen to go and fish for pearls. These went and in a few days obtained 64\r\nounces, which also he gave them. The Spaniards were surprised to see\r\nsuch pearls, and that their owners did not value them; they not only\r\ngave them away, but their paddles were decorated therewith, for the\r\nprincipal income and wealth of these chiefs was the pearl fishery.\r\nTomaco told Balboa that these riches were nothing in comparison with\r\nthose of Tararequi, which had pearls larger than a man’s eye, taken from\r\noysters the size of sombreros. The Spaniards wished to go there at once,\r\nbut fearing another tempest, left it for their return. They dismissed\r\nTomaco and rested in the country of Chiape, who, at the request of\r\nBalboa, sent thirty of his men to fish. These did it in the presence of\r\nseven Spaniards, who looked on and saw them take six loads of small\r\nshells. As it was not the season for that fishery, they did not go into\r\nvery deep water where the shells were. Not only did they not fish in\r\nSeptember and the following months, but they did not even travel by\r\nwater, on account of the stormy weather which then prevails in that sea.\r\nThe pearls which they extracted from those shells were like peas, but\r\nvery fine and white. Of those received from Tomaco, some were black,\r\nothers green, blue, and yellow.\r\n\r\nOn the return of Balboa’s expedition to Darien in 1514, the sight of the\r\npearls and the wonderful reports made by the men, caused his successor,\r\nPedrarias, to fit out another expedition, an account of which we\r\nlikewise translate from Gomara.\r\n\r\n  By command of Pedrarias, Gaspar de Morales went in the year 1515 to\r\n  the Gulf of St. Michael, with 550 Spaniards, in quest of the island\r\n  of Tararequi, which was said by Balboa’s men to be so abundant in\r\n  pearls and so near the coast. The chief of that island sallied forth\r\n  with many people to prevent his entrance, and clamored and fought\r\n  three times with our people on equal terms, but the fourth time he\r\n  was defeated. He then made friends, carried the chief of the\r\n  Spaniards to his house, which was a large and good one, gave him\r\n  food to eat, and a basket of pearls which weighed 110 marcs [880\r\n  ounces]. The chief received for them some looking-glasses, stringed\r\n  beads, bells, scissors, axes, and small wares of barter, which he\r\n  valued more than he had the pearls. He promised to give as tribute\r\n  to the emperor, in whose guardianship he placed himself, 100 marcs\r\n  of pearls every year. With these the Spaniards returned to the Gulf\r\n  of St. Michael and from thence to Darien.\r\n\r\n  Tararequi is within five degrees of the equator. It possessed a\r\n  great fishery for pearls, which are the largest and best of the new\r\n  world. Many of the pearls which the cacique gave were like filberts,\r\n  others like nutmegs, and there was one of 26 and another of 31\r\n  carats, pear-shaped, very lustrous, and most perfect, which Peter of\r\n  the Port, a shop-keeper, bought of Gaspar de Morales for 12,000\r\n  castilians. The purchaser could not sleep that night for thinking on\r\n  the fact that he had given so much money for one stone, and so he\r\n  sold it the very next day to Pedrarias de Avila, for his wife Donna\r\n  Isabel de Bovadilla, at the same price, and afterwards the Bovadilla\r\n  sold it to Donna Isabella the Empress.\r\n\r\n  Pedrarias, who delighted in such fishery, requested the cacique to\r\n  make his men fish for pearls in the presence of the Spaniards. The\r\n  fishermen were great swimmers and divers, and seemed to have spent\r\n  all their lives in that employment. They went in small boats when\r\n  the sea was calm, and not in any other manner. They cast a stone for\r\n  an anchor from each canoe, tied by strong, flexible withes like\r\n  boughs of the hazel. They plunged to search for oysters each with a\r\n  sack or bag at the neck, and returned loaded with them. They entered\r\n  four, six, and even ten fathoms of water, for the shell is larger\r\n  the deeper they go, and if at times the larger ones come in shallow\r\n  water it is through storms, or because they go from one place to\r\n  another in search for food, and having found their pasture they stay\r\n  there until they have finished it. They perceive those who search\r\n  for them, and stick so close to the rocks or ground, or one to\r\n  another, that much strength is needed to detach them, and many times\r\n  the fishermen cannot raise them and leave them, thinking they are\r\n  stones. In this fishery many persons are drowned, either by\r\n  remaining too long at the bottom, or because they become entwined or\r\n  entangled in the cord, or such carnivorous fish as the shark devour\r\n  them. This is the manner of fishing pearls in all the Indies, and\r\n  many fishermen die from the dangers aforesaid, and from the\r\n  excessive and constant labor, the little food, and the maltreatment\r\n  they have. The emperor was led to enact a law among those whom\r\n  Blasco Nunez Vela brought, which imposed the penalty of death upon\r\n  him who should forcibly compel any free Indian to fish for pearls.\r\n  He thought more of the lives of the men than of his interest in\r\n  pearls, though they were of great value. The law was worthy of such\r\n  a prince and of perpetual memory.[281]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CLARA EUGENIA, DAUGHTER OF PHILIP II\r\n\r\n  Painting by Gonzales, in the Galeria del Prado, Madrid Most of these\r\n    pearls were doubtless from the early American fisheries\r\n]\r\n\r\nGonzalo de Oviedo referred to the pearl resources of Panama in his\r\n“Historia natural de las Indias,” Toledo, 1526, mentioned in the chapter\r\non pearl fisheries of Venezuela. After describing the resources of\r\nCubagua and Cumana on the Venezuelan coast, he states, according to\r\nEden’s quaint translation:\r\n\r\n  Lykewise pearles are founde and gathered in the South sea cauled\r\n  _mare del sur_. And the pearles of this sea [the Caribbean coast]\r\n  are verye bygge. Yet not so bigge as they of the Ilande of pearles\r\n  cauled _de las perlas_, or _Margaritea_, whiche the Indians caule\r\n  _Terarequi_, lying in the gulfe of saincte Michael, where greater\r\n  pearles are founde and of greater price then in any other coaste of\r\n  the Northe sea, in _Cumana_, or any other porte. I speake this as a\r\n  trewe testimonie of syght, havyng byn longe in that South sea, and\r\n  makynge curious inquisition to bee certenly informed of all that\r\n  perteyneth to the fysshvnge of perles. From this Ilande of\r\n  Tararequi, there was brought a pearle of the fasshyon of a peare,\r\n  wayinge xxxi carattes, which Petrus Arias had amonge a thousande and\r\n  soo many poundes weight of other pearles which hee had when\r\n  capitayne Gaspar Morales (before Petrus Arias) passed to the saide\r\n  Ilande in the yeare 1515, which pearle was of great prise. From the\r\n  saide Ilande also, came a great and verye rounde pearle, whiche I\r\n  brought owte of the sea. This was as bygge as a smaule pellet of a\r\n  stone bowe, and of the weight of xxvi carattes. I boughte it in the\r\n  citie of Panama in the sea of Sur: and paide for it syxe hundredth\r\n  and fyftie tymes the weyght therof of good gold,[282] and had it\r\n  thre yeares in my custodie: and after my returne into Spaine, soulde\r\n  it to the erle of Nansao, Marquisse of Zenete, great chamberleyne to\r\n  youre maiestie, who gave it to the Marquesse his wyfe, the ladye\r\n  Mentia of Mendozza. I thyncke verely that this pearle was the\r\n  greatest, fayrest, and roundest that hath byn seene in those partes.\r\n  For youre maiestie owght to understande that in the coaste of the\r\n  sea of Sur, there are founde a hundredth great pearles rounde after\r\n  the fasshyon of peare, to one that is perfectly rounde and greate.\r\n  This Iland of Terarequi which the Christians caule the Ilande of\r\n  pearles, and other caule it the Ilande of floures, is founde in the\r\n  eyght degree on the southe syde of the firme lande in the provynce\r\n  of golden Castyle or Beragua. (Arber, “The First Three English Books\r\n  on America,” Birmingham, 1885.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the gems noted by Oviedo, these waters furnished many\r\nother beautiful pearls in the sixteenth century, and added largely to\r\nthe collections of the Spanish court and of the cathedrals of Seville,\r\nToledo, etc. The Italian traveler, Gemelli-Careri, who visited the\r\nPanama fisheries in 1697, reported that they yielded pearls equal to\r\nthose of Ceylon. He mentioned one weighing 60 grains, for which the\r\nowner—a Jesuit priest—refused 70,000 pesos.[283]\r\n\r\nIn 1735, the Spanish admiral, Antonio de Ulloa visited the Panama pearl\r\nfisheries and wrote an extended description of them.[284] According to\r\nhis account the pearls were then found in such plenty that there were\r\nfew slaveholders in the vicinity who did not employ at least a portion\r\nof their Negroes in the fishery. These were selected for their dexterity\r\nin diving, and were sent to the islands in gangs of from eight to twenty\r\nmen each, under the command of an overseer. They lived in temporary huts\r\non the shore, and visited the pearl reefs in small boats. Anchoring in\r\neight or ten fathoms of water, the Negroes would, dive in succession to\r\nthe bottom, returning with as many oysters as possible. It was laborious\r\nwork, attended with danger owing to the numerous sharks.\r\n\r\n  Every one of these Negro divers is obliged daily to deliver to his\r\n  master a fixed number of pearls; so that when they have got the\r\n  requisite number of oysters in their bag, they begin to open them,\r\n  and deliver the pearls to the officer, till they have made up the\r\n  number due to their master; and if the pearl be but formed, it is\r\n  sufficient, without any regard to its being small or faulty. The\r\n  remainder, however large or beautiful, are the Negro’s own property,\r\n  nor has the master the least claim to them, the slaves being allowed\r\n  to sell them to whom they please, though the master generally\r\n  purchases them at a very small price.... Some of these pearls,\r\n  though indeed but few, are sent to Europe, the greater part being\r\n  carried to Lima, where the demand for them is very great, being not\r\n  only universally worn there by all persons of rank, but also sent\r\n  from thence to the inland portions of Peru.[285]\r\n\r\nDuring the hundred years following, the pearl reefs of Panama were not\r\nvery productive, and relatively little attention was paid to them. The\r\ndevelopment of a market for the shells in the mother-of-pearl trade,\r\nabout 1840, enhanced the profits of the few natives engaged in pearling\r\nin a desultory manner, and led to an increase in the number of\r\nfishermen. During some years when industrial and market conditions were\r\nfavorable, large quantities of shells were exported. In 1855, for\r\ninstance, 650 tons of these shells were shipped to England alone, and in\r\n1859 the reported quantity was 957 tons. Those from the Island of San\r\nJosé, one of the Pearl Archipelago, were said to be the largest and\r\nchoicest in the bay. Many of them were used in decorating the twin\r\ntowers of the stately old cathedral at Panama.\r\n\r\nSince then the industry has fluctuated greatly, depending on the market\r\nfor the shell. Many outsiders have experimented in the fishery, but most\r\nof these attempts have resulted in financial loss, through\r\nmismanagement, storms, sickness, or other causes. A story is told\r\nlocally of a party of thirty men, principally from Scotland, who arrived\r\nat Panama equipped with a diving-bell and such necessary machinery as\r\nair-pumps, windlasses, etc. Much was expected of their operations, but\r\nsoon yellow fever broke out among them, and within six weeks two thirds\r\nof the members of the party had died. The remaining members, becoming\r\ndisheartened, and in fear of the dread disease, lost no time in leaving\r\nthe country. The diving-bell and machinery remained for several years as\r\na curiosity at Panama, for no one returned to claim them, nor has the\r\nuse of similar apparatus been attempted since then.\r\n\r\nThe scattered pearl reefs extend from the east side of the Bay of Panama\r\nnearly to the Costa Rica boundary. However, this gives an exaggerated\r\nidea of their area, as much of this territory yields no pearl-oysters\r\nwhatever. The principal reefs and the headquarters of the fishery are at\r\nArchipelago de las Perlas or Pearl Islands, which are from thirty to\r\nsixty miles southeast of the Pacific terminus of the projected Panama\r\nCanal. This archipelago contains sixteen small islands, on which are\r\nabout twice that number of small settlements of Negro and Indian\r\ndescendants, with a total population of perhaps one thousand. About half\r\nof these live on Isla del Rey, the largest island, about fifteen miles\r\nlong and half that in width. The chief village, San Miguel, is the\r\ncenter of the pearling industry, and consists mostly of palm-thatched\r\nhuts and a handsome stone church, more costly than all the remaining\r\nbuildings of the town combined. While the soil is fertile and some\r\nvegetables are raised, the inhabitants depend almost wholly on the\r\nfisheries.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, the Republic of Colombia invited bids for the right to operate\r\nthe pearl and coral fisheries for a term of fifteen years, but nothing\r\nseems to have come of it, and the establishment of the Panama Republic\r\nin 1903 terminated the authority of Colombia in these resources.\r\n\r\nThe Panama fisheries differ widely in their character from those of\r\nVenezuela. The mollusk is much larger, averaging about six inches in\r\ndiameter when fully grown, thus furnishing a valuable quality of\r\nmother-of-pearl. The shell constitutes the principal object of the\r\nfishery; the pearls themselves are of incidental importance, but are\r\nalways looked for and anxiously expected.\r\n\r\nThe season extends from May to November, with a rest during the\r\nremaining five months of the year. The fishery is open to natives and to\r\nforeigners alike. While the leading fishermen employ diving-suits, which\r\nwere introduced here about 1890, nude diving is yet practised to a\r\nconsiderable extent, the men descending in eight or ten, and some even\r\nin twelve fathoms of water. There is no restriction whatever on the nude\r\nfishermen, but for each machine diver an annual license fee of $125\r\nUnited States currency is exacted.\r\n\r\nOwing to the low market price for Panama shell during recent years, the\r\nfishery has not been vigorously prosecuted, and it has even dwindled to\r\nlow proportions. A letter from one of the leading pearling companies in\r\nPanama states that the machine divers number about twenty, while there\r\nare about four hundred nude fishermen; and another firm likewise\r\nprominent, estimates these fishermen at twenty and three hundred\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nYet a third pearling company writes that there are fifteen machine\r\ndivers and two hundred head divers; and adds that the small demand for\r\nthis quality of mother-of-pearl has made the condition of the industry\r\nabout as bad as it could be; many who have capital invested are getting\r\nout of the business, and unless the market improves, the industry may be\r\nabandoned. Probably with the introduction of new capital and methods in\r\nthe infant republic, the pearl resources may receive greater attention\r\nand a large development ensue.\r\n\r\nThe Panama pearls are of good quality and frequently of large size. In\r\ncolor they range from white to green and lead-gray, and frequently\r\ngreenish black. Valuable pearls are not common, but occasionally the\r\nfisherman is amply rewarded. A letter from the American consul at Panama\r\nstates that in 1899 a native boy, fifteen years old, fishing in shallow\r\nwater, as much for sport as for profit, found a pearl which he sold to a\r\nlocal speculator for 4000 silver dollars ($1760); this speculator\r\ndelivered the same pearl to a dealer in Panama for 10,000 silver dollars\r\n($4400), and an offer of 30,000 francs was refused for it later in\r\nParis. A pearl worth $2400 was reported as found within half a mile of\r\nthe steamship anchorage at Panama. A pearl from a giant oyster\r\nresembling Tridacna, was an absolute egg-shape, pure cocoanut white, and\r\nweighed 169 grains; it was 21 mm. at the longest and 16.5 mm. at the\r\nnarrowest part. The surface showed very distinctly a wavy structure,\r\noccasionally with a tiny, brighter central point; the surface under the\r\nglass resembling a honeycomb network. At the smallest point there was a\r\nradiated center with quite a brilliant field. It was worth only $100.\r\n\r\nNot always, however, does the poor, ignorant fisherman receive the full\r\nvalue of his find; and many a story is told of some thoughtless\r\nimprovident native, who, for less than a mess of pottage, “like the base\r\nIndian, threw a pearl away, richer than half his tribe.”\r\n\r\nMost of the Panama pearls are sold in Paris, relatively few of them\r\ncoming to America direct. This is not because of any greater estimation\r\nof them in Paris or higher prices obtained; but the trade relation has\r\nbeen long continued and the credits are well established. From Paris\r\nmany of these pearls reach the American market.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PEARL FISHERIES OF MEXICO\r\n\r\n            Then, too, the pearl from out its shell,\r\n              Unsightly in the sunless sea,\r\n            (As ’twere a spirit, forced to dwell\r\n              In form unlovely) was set free,\r\n            And round the neck of woman threw\r\n              A light it lent and borrowed too.\r\n\r\n                    THOMAS MOORE, _The Loves of the Angels_.\r\n\r\nPearl-bearing oysters are found at various places on the Pacific coast\r\nof Mexico, and especially along the coast of Lower California, where\r\nextensive fisheries are prosecuted. The pearls are noted for the great\r\nvariety of colors which they display. A large percentage are black,\r\nothers are white, brown, peacock green, etc. Generally they are small\r\nand of irregular form, yet sometimes very large ones are secured,\r\nweighing 100, 200, and even 300 grains.\r\n\r\nEuropean knowledge of the pearl resources of Mexico dates from the\r\nconquest of that country by Hernando Cortés about 1522. The diary of his\r\nlieutenant, Fortuno Ximines, tells of finding native chiefs living in\r\nprimitive huts along the sea-shore, with quantities of beautiful pearls\r\nlying carelessly around. From a tribe near the present site of\r\nHermosillo, in the State of Sonora, Cortés secured great quantities of\r\nthe gems. It appeared that the fishery had been in existence for\r\ncenturies. The location of the pearl reefs was prominently noted on\r\nCortés’ map of this coast, made in 1535, a copy of which was procured by\r\nthe Rev. Edward E. Hale when in Spain in 1883.\r\n\r\nFollowing Cortés’ explorations of the Pacific coast of Mexico\r\n(1533–1538), a number of expeditions were fitted out for securing pearls\r\nby trading with the natives, by forcing them to fish, and by even more\r\nquestionable means. Several of these expeditions found record in history\r\neither by reason of their unusual success or through the extreme cruelty\r\nwith which they were conducted. The contact of the Spaniards with the\r\nIndians resulted in very bitter feelings on the part of the latter, so\r\nthat it became risky for small traders to venture among them. From time\r\nto time, successful expeditions were made, especially the one of 200 men\r\nsent in 1596 by the viceroy of Mexico to “the rich Isles of California,”\r\nmentioned by Teixeira.[286] Antonio de Castillo, a Spanish colonist,\r\nwith headquarters south of Mazatlan, was one of the most successful of\r\nthe early adventurers, and Iturbide Ortega and José Carborel were also\r\namong the fortunate ones of that period.[287] Ortega marketed his pearls\r\nin the city of Mexico, and the reported sale of one for 4500 dollars had\r\nconsiderable effect in stimulating the industry.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the Jesuits to western Mexico in 1642, developed amicable\r\nrelations with the Indians; and although the missionaries were\r\nagriculturists rather than fishermen, the restoration of harmony\r\nresulted in a more favorable prosecution of the fisheries. The colonists\r\nof Sinaloa and Nueva Galicia, who had formerly, in small vessels and\r\nwith great danger, made occasional visits to the pearl beds, built\r\nlarger vessels and made more frequent visits without apprehension. The\r\nskilful Yaqui and Mayo Indians were employed or impressed as divers,\r\njust as natives of the Bahamas had served in the fisheries of Venezuela.\r\nGreat profits resulted from the operations. Venegas wrote that “it was\r\ncertain that the fifth of every vessel was yearly farmed for 12,000\r\ndollars.”[288]\r\n\r\nSo profitable was the fishery that the Spanish soldiers and sailors\r\nstationed in the Gulf of Cortes—as the Gulf of California was then\r\ncalled—were frequently charged with devoting more attention to pearling\r\nthan to their official duties. In order to put a stop to this evil, in\r\n1704, Father Silva-Tierra, who was in authority in that part of the\r\ncountry, ordered that no soldier or sailor should engage in the fishery.\r\nWith a view to removing the demoralizing influences of promiscuous\r\nadventurers among the Indians, the industry was later restricted to\r\npersons specially authorized.\r\n\r\nProbably the most successful of the early pearlers was Manuel Osio, who\r\nis credited with having marketed “127 pounds’ weight of pearls in 1743,”\r\nand “275 pounds’ weight” in 1744.[289] He operated in the vicinity of\r\nMulege and northward, employing the Yaqui Indians; and through his\r\npearling interests is said to have become the richest man in Lower\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Gulf of California and the pearling territory of western Mexico\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe revenue from the royal fifth, somewhat later, was reported by\r\nAlvarado[290] at 12,000 dollars per year; but this was disputed by Jacob\r\nBaegert, a Jesuit priest. Baegert spent seventeen years in Mexico and,\r\nreturning to Europe on the expulsion of his order from that country in\r\n1767, published a report in 1772, containing rather an unfavorable view\r\nof the fishery. He stated that each summer eight, ten, or twelve poor\r\nSpaniards from Sonora, Sinaloa, and elsewhere on the mainland, crossed\r\nthe gulf in small boats to the California shore for the purpose of\r\nobtaining pearls. They carried supplies of Indian corn and dried beef,\r\nand also a number of Indians who served as divers, the Spaniards\r\nthemselves showing little inclination to engage in the work when native\r\nfishermen could be employed so cheaply. Provided with a sack for\r\nreceiving the oysters which they removed from the bottom, the fishermen\r\ndived head first into the sea, and when they could no longer hold their\r\nbreath they ascended with the gathered treasure. The oysters were\r\ncounted before opening; and, when the law was complied with, every fifth\r\none was put aside for the king’s revenue. Most of the oysters yielded no\r\npearls; some contained black pearls, others white ones, the latter\r\nusually small and ill-shaped. If, after six or eight weeks of hard labor\r\nand deducting all expenses, a Spaniard gained a hundred American pesos,\r\nhe thought he had made a little fortune, but this he could not do every\r\nseason. “God knows,” said Baegert, “whether a fifth of the pearls\r\nsecured in the California sea yields to the Catholic king an average of\r\n150 or 200 pesos in a year, even without frauds in the transaction. I\r\nheard of only two persons—with whom also I was personally acquainted—who\r\nhad accumulated some wealth, after spending 20 or more years in the\r\nbusiness. The others remained poor notwithstanding their pearl\r\nfishing.”[291]\r\n\r\nFather Baegert’s statement of the returns seems to be substantiated by\r\nthe reports of the royal fifth a few years later. For the period from\r\n1792 to 1796 this was placed at “2 lbs. 2 ozs.” by some writers; and\r\naccording to others, from 1788 to 1797 it amounted to only “3 lbs. 9\r\nozs.,” which is the quantity assigned by some accounts to 1797\r\nalone.[292] These returns apparently indicate that a great decrease had\r\noccurred since the days of Osio; but it seems very doubtful whether,\r\nunder the conditions existing in Mexico at that time, the royal treasury\r\nreceived its due share of the proceeds.\r\n\r\nShortly following the independence of Mexico in 1821, and after a period\r\nof little activity, several attempts were made to exploit the pearl\r\nresources. The great prosperity in England, ensuing upon the termination\r\nof the Napoleonic Wars, resulted in much speculation and the promotion\r\nof stock subscriptions in many visionary schemes. Among these was “The\r\nGeneral Pearl and Coral-Fishing Association of London,” which in 1825\r\nequipped and sent out to Mexico, by way of Cape Horn, two vessels\r\nprepared to exploit the pearl resources by the use of diving-bells\r\nsimilar to those formerly employed in submarine construction. This\r\nexpedition was under the direction of Lieutenant R. W. H. Hardy, whose\r\nreport thereon presents an interesting exhibit of the condition of the\r\npearl fishery at that time.\r\n\r\nHardy found the fishery at a very low ebb, owing, largely, to the\r\nscarcity of oysters and the uncertainty of depending on the native\r\ndivers. He adds with peculiar naïveté: “I had almost forgotten to\r\nmention a very curious circumstance with respect to the pearl-oyster,\r\nnamely that on the coast of Sonora there are none at all, except at\r\nGuaymas.” He states also that to the northward of 28° 30′ not the trace\r\nof a shell could be discovered on either side of the gulf.\r\n\r\nThe center of the industry was then at Loreto, a village of 250\r\ninhabitants; but another small station existed at La Paz. At Loreto six\r\nor eight vessels of twenty-five tons each were employed, each having\r\nthree or four sailors and fifteen or twenty Yaqui Indians who served as\r\ndivers. Head-diving was in vogue, the work proceeding from 11 A.M. to 2\r\nP.M., and the depth ranging from three to twelve fathoms. The annual\r\ncatch of pearls was “4 or 5 pounds’ weight, worth from $8000 to\r\n$10,000.”[293] After the government’s claim of one fifth had been set\r\napart, the owner and captain of the vessel received one half and the\r\ndivers the other half.\r\n\r\nIt was found impossible to use diving-bells when the sea was at all\r\nrough, and even during calm weather they were impracticable on account\r\nof the unevenness of the ground and the strong undercurrents. An effort\r\nwas made to employ native divers, but owing to the disorganized state of\r\naffairs only four could be secured. In the Gulf of Mulege a large number\r\nof oysters were collected, but when these were opened “six very small\r\npearls” were all that could be found. After spending about three years\r\non the coast, Hardy returned to England, and the company abandoned the\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIn the early history of the Mexican pearl fishery, the shells were of no\r\nmarket value; but about 1830 a French trader named Combier made\r\nexperimental shipments to France, securing cheap freight rates by using\r\nthe waste shells largely as ballast for the vessels.[294] The best\r\nquality sold for about 600 francs per ton, and the market was found\r\nsufficient for regular shipments. The value gradually increased, and in\r\n1854 it approximated 2000 francs per ton in France, placing the industry\r\nupon a very remunerative basis. This resulted in much activity in the\r\nfishery, and an increase in the number of boats and divers.\r\n\r\nIn 1855, the fishery gave employment to 368 divers, and yielded $23,800\r\nworth of pearls, and 350 tons of shells worth $13,500.[295] It was\r\nestimated by Lassepas that from 1580 to 1857, inclusive, 95,000 tons of\r\noysters were removed from the Gulf of California, yielding 2770 pounds\r\nof pearls, worth $5,540,000.[296]\r\n\r\nFor protection of the reefs, the Mexican government in 1857 divided the\r\nGulf of California into four pearling districts, and provided that only\r\none of them should be worked each year, and then only in areas leased\r\nfor the season to the highest bidders, thereby permitting the reefs\r\nsuccessively to remain undisturbed for three years.\r\n\r\nThe yield of pearls in 1868 approximated $55,000, and that of shells\r\n$10,600 in value; while in 1869 these items were given as $62,000 and\r\n$25,000, respectively.[297] The local prices ranged from $15 per ounce\r\nfor seed-pearls to $1500 for a choice gem.\r\n\r\nAt that period the fishery was carried on from shore camps or from large\r\nvessels, each carrying twenty to fifty divers, who were mostly Yaqui\r\nIndians from the eastern shore of the gulf. The camp or vessel was\r\nlocated in the vicinity of the reefs or beds, and the fishing was\r\nprosecuted from small boats, each carrying three or four nude divers.\r\nFastened to the waist or suspended from the neck was a net for the\r\nreception of oysters, and each diver carried a short spud or stick with\r\nwhich to detach them from the bottom, and to some extent for use as a\r\nweapon of defense against sharks and similar enemies. The diving\r\nprogressed mostly in the morning, when the sea was unruffled by the\r\nbreeze which usually begins shortly after noon. The season lasted from\r\nMay to late in September, when the water became too cold for further\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nThe divers were paid a definite share of the catch, and kept in\r\ndebt-bondage by means of advances and supplies. Little clothing was\r\nnecessary, and the provisions consisted principally of corn, beans, and\r\nsun-dried beef. Luxuries were added in the form of tobacco, and of\r\nmescal distilled from the maguey plant, indulgence in these constituting\r\nthe chief remuneration for the season’s labor. The finding of an\r\nunusually choice pearl brought to the lucky fisherman a gratuity of a\r\nfew dollars, and shore leave for several days in which to spend it.\r\nDressing in his best calico garments, he hastened to the nearest town to\r\nindulge in release from restraint, in drunkenness and debauchery—the\r\nhighest dreams of happiness of a Yaqui Indian—thoughts of which served\r\nto bring him to the fishery each year from his home across the gulf.\r\n\r\nFrom the Spanish conquest until 1874, the Mexican pearl fishery was\r\nconducted exclusively by nude divers. The experiments with the\r\ndiving-bell in 1825 had been without favorable result, and also an\r\nattempt by an American in 1854 to use a diving-suit with air-pump, etc.,\r\nthis failure being credited to imperfection of apparatus. In 1874,\r\nthrough the influence of European pearl merchants, two schooners, each\r\nof about 200 tons’ measurement, one from Australia and the other from\r\nEngland, visited the Mexican grounds, with a dozen boats fully equipped\r\nwith scaphanders or diving armor, including helmets, rubber suits,\r\npumps, etc. Owing to their working in deeper water than the nude divers\r\nwere able to exploit, their success was remarkable, and they secured\r\nupward of a hundred thousand dollars’ worth of pearls and shells during\r\nthe first season.\r\n\r\nThe hitherto somnolent inhabitants of Lower California were amazed at\r\nseeing their resources thus easily removed, and were awakened to the\r\nopportunities afforded them to acquire the wealth which nature had\r\nscattered at their very doors. With this object-lesson before them,\r\ncompanies were formed for raising sufficient capital for the business,\r\nand the leading operators equipped their men with scaphanders, to the\r\ngreat annoyance of the would-be independent fishermen, who had not\r\nsufficient means to purchase the costly equipment. Many of these\r\ncontinued to employ nude divers, but after 1880 this method of fishery\r\nwas subordinate to the use of diving apparatus. The change was\r\naccompanied by many accidents, and rarely did a month pass without the\r\nloss of a man, due in most cases to faulty apparatus or to inexperienced\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 President Gonzalez inaugurated the policy of granting exclusive\r\nconcessions to the pearl reefs. On February 28 of that year, five\r\nconcessions were granted to as many persons, giving them and their\r\nassociates and assigns the exclusive right to all shell fisheries in\r\ntheir respective zones of large area, for a period of sixteen years, in\r\nconsideration of a royalty and export duty, amounting altogether to\r\nabout $10 per ton of shells exported in the first three years, and $15\r\nper ton for the remaining thirteen years of the term. Immediately these\r\nfive grants were consolidated, forming the Lower California Pearl\r\nFishing Company (“Compañia Perlífera de la Baja California”),\r\nincorporated under the laws of California with an invested capital of\r\n$100,000.\r\n\r\nOther concessions were given covering the ocean shore of Lower\r\nCalifornia, the eastern side of the gulf within the States of Sonora and\r\nSinaloa, and the ocean shore of Mexico southward from Sinaloa. In\r\naddition to these, certain territorial rights of fishing are claimed\r\nthrough grants dating back very early in the history of the country. So\r\neagerly have these concessions been sought in recent years, that there\r\nis now little pearling ground on the coast which is not under corporate\r\nor private claim. And, owing to speculation in these concessions and in\r\nthe formation of companies to develop them, it is somewhat difficult to\r\nobtain wholly reliable data relative to the condition and extent of the\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nTwo species of pearl-bearing mollusks occur on the Mexican coast. The\r\nprincipal one is the _M. margaritifera mazatlanica_, known locally as\r\nthe _concha de perla fina_. This species is closely related to the\r\n“black lip shell” of the Australian coast. It is considerably larger\r\nthan the Venezuelan oyster, averaging four or five inches in diameter\r\nand attaining an extreme diameter of seven or possibly eight inches. It\r\noccurs to some extent all along the Pacific coast of Mexico, in detached\r\nbeds intercalated in places. The principal reefs, which have been\r\nexploited for nearly four centuries, are in the shallow waters of the\r\nGulf of California and especially within the 300 miles between Cape San\r\nLucas and Mulege Bay. The fisheries have centered about the islands of\r\nCerralvo, Espiritu Santo, Carmen, and San José, and in the bays of\r\nMulege, Ventana, and San Lorenzo. The depth of water on the reefs ranges\r\nfrom two to twenty-five fathoms, with an average of probably six or\r\neight fathoms. The species is generally isolated, and firmly attached by\r\nthe byssus to the bottom rocks or the stone corals, from which it may\r\nremove in case of necessity, though it probably does not do so\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nThe second species is known locally under the name _concha nacar_, and\r\nhas been named _Margaritifera_ (_Avicula_) _vinesi_ (Rochebonne).[298]\r\nIt occurs only in the northern part of the gulf near the mouth of the\r\nColorado River. Formerly it was abundant in that region, occurring in\r\nlarge areas, but it has become much reduced and is now little sought\r\nafter. It is claimed that this species is far more productive of pearls\r\nthan the _M. margaritifera_, and that it yielded the large quantities\r\nobtained by Osio in the eighteenth century. Although iridescent, the\r\nshell is so thin and convex that it is without commercial value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE ADAMS GOLD VASE\r\n\r\n  Ornamented with American gems and fresh-water pearls, rock crystal,\r\n    gold quartz and agatized wood\r\n\r\n  Top of vase and side view\r\n\r\n  Now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe headquarters of the Mexican pearl fishery are at La Paz, the capital\r\nof Lower California, 240 miles northwest of Mazatlan and 150 miles north\r\nof Cape San Lucas. This “Mantle of Peace”—the literal translation of La\r\nPaz—contains about 5000 inhabitants, nearly all of whom are more or less\r\ndependent on the pearl fishery. It presents an attractive picture, with\r\nthe cocoanut-palms extending down almost to the water’s edge, and the\r\nhigh mountains forming a background. The low, stone houses, the tile\r\nroofs, the plaza with tropical trees, and the beautiful flower beds\r\nunder perennial sunny skies, give it a quaint appearance. The most\r\nconspicuous objects from the harbor are the large old warehouses, with\r\nthick walls and iron-barred windows, for the storage of the pearls and\r\nthe shells. During the season, from April to November, the arrival and\r\ndeparture of the pearling vessels presents a scene of great animation.\r\n\r\nThe present methods of the fishery on the Mexican coast are quite\r\ndifferent from those of thirty years ago when nude diving was the only\r\nmethod in vogue. Instead of the haphazard work, largely in shallow\r\nwater, the industry is conducted systematically, and the limit of depth\r\nis increased, much of the diving being in depths of ten to fifteen\r\nfathoms. The fishermen operate either from a large vessel making a\r\ncruise two or three months in length, or from a camp on the shore near\r\nthe reefs. A vessel visits them frequently to furnish supplies and to\r\ntransport the catch to La Paz. The fishing boats are undecked craft,\r\neach equipped with an air-pump and a crew of six men: a diver, a _cabo\r\nde vida_ or life-line man, who is usually the captain, two _bomberos_ at\r\nthe air-pump, and two rowers.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth at which armored diving is attempted in Mexico rarely\r\nexceeds twenty fathoms; twenty-five fathoms is fully as deep as it is\r\npracticable to go, and it is not advisable to remain at that depth more\r\nthan a very few minutes. At fifteen fathoms a diver may remain half an\r\nhour or more, and at six or eight fathoms he may work uninterruptedly\r\nfor several hours. When the water is very cold, the diver comes up\r\nfrequently to restore his numbed circulation by vigorous rubbing. The\r\noccupation is especially conducive to rheumatism, and paralysis is more\r\nor less general, due, not only to the compressed atmosphere, but to the\r\nabrupt changes of temperature. The work is very debilitating, with\r\nparticular effect on the nerves, and partial deafness is common. It is\r\nimportant that the diver be careful about overeating before descending,\r\nas heavy foods, and meats especially, make respiration difficult;\r\ntherefore, breakfast consists of little more than bread and coffee. The\r\nrisks and dangers from sharks, devil-fish, etc., have greatly diminished\r\nsince the introduction of scaphanders; for a stout diver in his\r\nwaterproof dress, with leads on the breast, shoulders, and shoes, and on\r\nhis head a massive helmet containing great gaping windows for eyes, is\r\nenough to cause even a hungry shark to hesitate and to seek a more\r\ndigestible meal.\r\n\r\nThere are yet many nude divers in Mexico, who operate in shallow waters,\r\ntheir cheap labor making them successful competitors of the armored\r\ndivers. In arranging with these, the pearling company commonly\r\ngrub-stakes a crew, pays a stipulated sum per hundredweight for the\r\nshells, and bargains for the pearls. If the fishermen are not satisfied\r\nwith the price offered for these, they are at liberty to sell to other\r\nbuyers under certain restrictions.\r\n\r\nNude diving is confined to the warm months, beginning about the middle\r\nof May and continuing until October. Owing to the cloudy or muddy\r\ncondition of the water in the gulf, the nude diver can not inspect the\r\nbottom from the surface and select the best oysters before descending,\r\nnor can he work satisfactorily at depths greater than seven or eight\r\nfathoms. While the work is hard, it is more remunerative than the\r\naverage branch of labor in this region.\r\n\r\nEach day the boats deliver their catch of oysters at the fishing-camps\r\nor on board the receiving vessels. After they have been freed from\r\nmarine growths and refuse, the mollusks are opened and searched for\r\npearls. This operation is performed by trusted employees, usually\r\nelderly men who have become physically disqualified for diving, and who,\r\nseated together at a low table, work under the watchful eyes of\r\noverseers. A knife is introduced between the valves of the oyster, the\r\nadductor muscle is severed, and the valves are separated by breaking the\r\nhinge. The animal is removed from the shell and carefully examined with\r\nthe eyes and the fingers, and then squeezed in the hands to locate any\r\npearl which may be concealed in the organs or tissues. The debris is\r\npassed to other persons, who submit it to further examinations. A man\r\nmay work all day long and find only a few seed-pearls, but occasionally\r\nthere is the excitement of discovering a beautiful gem.\r\n\r\nIn some localities the flesh of the pearl-oyster is a source of profit\r\nthrough its sale to Chinamen, who dry and otherwise prepare it for sale\r\namong their countrymen in Mexico and America, as well as in the Orient.\r\nFrequently the large adductor muscle is dried for food, making excellent\r\nsoup-stock, and, indeed, it is quite palatable when stewed.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to approximate the output of the Mexican pearl\r\nfisheries, other than the pearl shell, because the dealers place a\r\nmerely nominal value on the pearls in their invoices when sending them\r\nto Europe, an invoice of $500 sometimes representing gems valued in\r\nParis at several thousand dollars. Furthermore, it is difficult to\r\nobtain satisfactory information from the pearling companies, owing,\r\npresumably, to the fear of developing greater competition. According to\r\nthe estimates at La Paz, the local value of the pearl yield now\r\napproximates $250,000 annually, and the value of the same over the\r\ncounters in Europe and America probably exceeds one million dollars.\r\n\r\nSome remarkably large pearls have been secured in the Mexican fisheries,\r\nespecially considering the small size of the oysters. In 1871 a pearl of\r\n96 grains, pear-shaped and without a flaw, sold at La Paz for 3000\r\npesos. In March, 1907, a beautiful pinkish white one, found near the\r\nlower end of the peninsula, sold for 28,000 pesos or $14,000. One of the\r\nbest years for choice finds was 1881, when the scaphanders were first\r\nemployed to their greatest efficiency. A black pearl was then secured\r\nwhich weighed 112 grains, and which brought 40,000 francs in Paris. In\r\n1882 two, weighing 124 and 180 grains respectively, sold for 11,000\r\npesos. In the following year a light brown pearl, flecked with dark\r\nbrown, and weighing 260 grains, sold for 7500 pesos. These are the\r\nprices which the La Paz merchants received for these pearls, and not the\r\nmuch greater amounts for which they were finally sold by the jewelers.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest pearls was found in 1884 near Mulege. This weighed 372\r\ngrains. The Indian fisherman is said to have sold it for $90; the\r\npurchaser declined an offer of 1000 pesos, and also a second offer of\r\n5000, and soon sold it to a La Paz dealer for 10,000 pesos. Its value in\r\nParis was estimated at 85,000 francs. Probably the most famous of all\r\npearls obtained from these grounds was “the 400–grain pearl” found near\r\nLoreto, and “which is now among the royal jewels of Spain.” It is said\r\nthat this was offered by the lucky fisherman to the Mission of Loreto,\r\nand by the Director of Missions in Lower California was presented to the\r\nQueen of Spain.[299]\r\n\r\nAs in every other fishery, one hears in Mexico of fishermen who have\r\ngrasped a prize only to lose it through inexperience or improvidence.\r\nThe account given above of the sale of the 372–grain pearl found near\r\nMulege furnishes an instance of this. It is related in La Paz that in\r\n1883 an Indian sold for ten pesos a gem weighing 128 grains, for which\r\nthe purchaser received 27,500 francs in Paris. On another occasion a\r\nMexican sold two pearls, easily worth $4000, for $16 worth of groceries.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century, the Notre Dame de Loreto possessed a\r\nremarkable collection of Mexican pearls, which had been presented from\r\ntime to time by the fishermen. During the régime of the Jesuits, it was\r\ncustomary to devote the proceeds of the last day of the fishery to the\r\ndecoration of the altar of that mission. After the expulsion of this\r\nreligious order in 1767, the mission was pillaged and the collection\r\ndissipated. From the old aristocracy of Mexico, family heirlooms of many\r\nchoice pearls were placed on the European market during the civil wars\r\nin Mexico to contribute to the support of the contending armies. One\r\nlady in Sonora is said to have disposed of her collection for 550,000\r\nfrancs. A fine collection of these pearls, accumulated from 1760 to\r\n1850, and showing them in a great variety of colors, shapes, and sizes,\r\nwas in Chihuahua until recently.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AMERICAN FRESH WATERS\r\n\r\n          And my pearls are pure as thy own fair neck,\r\n          With whose radiant light they vie.\r\n\r\n                              WHITTIER, _The Vaudois Teacher_.\r\n\r\nThe most recently developed pearl fisheries are within the limits of the\r\nUnited States, in the rivers and fresh-water lakes, and especially those\r\nin the Mississippi Valley. As an important industrial enterprise, these\r\nfisheries are less than two decades old, yet they are very productive,\r\nyielding annually above half a million dollars’ worth of pearls, many of\r\nwhich compare favorably in quality with those from oriental seas.\r\n\r\nThe prehistoric mounds in the Mississippi Valley present evidence of the\r\nestimation in which pearls were held by a race of men who passed away\r\nages before America was first visited by Europeans. In some of these\r\nmounds, erected by a long-forgotten race, pearls have been found not\r\nonly in hundreds and in thousands, but by gallons and even by bushels.\r\nSome of these equal three quarters of an inch in diameter, and in\r\nquantity exceed the richest individual collections of the present day.\r\nDamaged and partly decomposed by heat and through centuries of burial,\r\nthey have lost their beauty, and are of value only to the archæologist\r\nand to indicate the quantity of pearly treasures possessed by these\r\nearly people.\r\n\r\nOwing to the great wealth of pearls which had been uncovered on the\r\nSpanish Main, at Panama, and in the Gulf of California, Eldorado\r\nexplorers, in the sixteenth century, were particularly eager in\r\nsearching for them within the present limits of the United States; in\r\nthe reports of their wanderings, much space is given to these gems, and\r\nthese reports aided largely in inducing and encouraging other\r\nexpeditions. Some of these accounts read like the marvelous stories of\r\nSindbad the Sailor, quantities of pearls—hundreds of pounds in some\r\ninstances—being secured by the exchange of trinkets and by more\r\nquestionable means. It would be easy to bring together numerous accounts\r\nof apparently reliable authorities to show that in the sixteenth century\r\npearls were obtained here in far greater quantities than were ever known\r\nin any other part of the world; but this conclusion seems not wholly\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate wanderings of Hernando de Soto from 1539 to 1542 gave\r\nrise to most of the reports of rich pearl finds within the limits of\r\nthis country. Of this voyage there are three principal accounts. The\r\nfirst was by Luis Hernandez de Biedma, who had accompanied De Soto as\r\nfactor for Charles V of Spain. His brief report was presented to the\r\nking in 1544, although it was not published until 1841, nearly three\r\ncenturies later, when it appeared in a French translation.[300] The\r\nsecond, and in our opinion the most reliable account,[301] published at\r\nEvora in 1577, was by an unnamed Portuguese (in English editions,\r\ncommonly spoken of as the Gentleman of Elvas), who was a member of the\r\nexpedition. The third account,[302] by far the longest and most widely\r\nknown, but which was not written until 1591, was by Garcilasso de la\r\nVega, who represented that his information was from a Spanish cavalier\r\nwho had accompanied De Soto.\r\n\r\nThe only reference made to pearls in Biedma’s report seems to be his\r\nallusion to the large quantity secured at the village of Cofaciqui, on\r\nthe east bank of the Savannah River. He states: “When we arrived there,\r\nthe queen ... presented the governor with a necklace of pearls of five\r\nor six rows, procured for us canoes to pass the river, and assigned the\r\nhalf of the village for our quarters. After having been in our company\r\nthree or four days, she escaped into the forest; the governor caused\r\nsearch to be made after her, but without success; he then gave orders to\r\nbreak open a temple erected in this village, wherein the chiefs of the\r\ncountry were interred. We took out of it a vast quantity of pearls,\r\nwhich might amount to six or seven arrobas,[303] but they were spoiled\r\nby having been underground.”[304]\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese narrative alludes to the pearls at Cofaciqui, stating\r\nthat the queen “took from her own neck a great cordon of pearls, and\r\ncast it about the neck of the governor.... And the lady, perceiving that\r\nthe Christians esteemed the pearls, advised the governor to search\r\ncertain graves in the town, where he would find many; and that if he\r\nwould send to the abandoned towns, he might load all his horses. He\r\nsought the graves of that town and there found fourteen rows of pearls,\r\nand little babies and birds made of them.”[305] This account makes no\r\nfurther mention of pearls, except to state that at the battle of Mavilla\r\nthis great collection was burned, and that when the Queen of Cofaciqui\r\nescaped from the Portuguese she carried with her a little chest full of\r\nunbored pearls, which some of the Spaniards thought were of great\r\nvalue;[306] and further, that on one or two other occasions a few pearls\r\nwere received from the Indians as presents.\r\n\r\nThe account of De Soto’s wanderings, given by Garcilasso, the Peruvian\r\nhistorian, contains many references to pearls, which read more like\r\nromance than reality. With his knowledge of the jewels, temples, etc.,\r\nin Mexico and Peru, and recognizing some similarities in the manners of\r\nthe people of those countries and the ones with whom De Soto came in\r\ncontact, Garcilasso was easily led to statements which, though possibly\r\ntrue in the one case, seem fictitious in the other.\r\n\r\nHe gives the story of the Queen of Cofaciqui, with some additional\r\nparticulars. The string of pearls which she presented to the governor\r\nmade three circuits of her neck and descended to her waist. In his\r\naccount, the graves in Cofaciqui became a temple containing, among other\r\nriches, more than a thousand measures of pearls, of which they took only\r\ntwo. Near Cofaciqui was the temple of Talomeco, over a hundred steps\r\nlong by forty broad, with the walls high in proportion. Upon the roof of\r\nthe temple were shells of different sizes, placed with the inside out,\r\nto give more brilliancy, and with the intervals “filled with many\r\nstrings of pearls of divers sizes, in the form of festoons, from one\r\nshell to the other, and extending from the top of the roof to the\r\nbottom.” Within the temple, festoons of pearls hung from the ceiling and\r\nfrom all other parts of the building. In the middle were three rows of\r\nchests of graded sizes, arranged in pyramids of five or six chests each,\r\naccording to their sizes. “All these chests were filled with pearls, in\r\nsuch a manner that the largest contain the largest pearls, and thus, in\r\nsuccession, to the smallest, which were full of seed-pearls only. The\r\nquantity of pearls was such, that the Spaniards avowed, that even if\r\nthere had been more than nine hundred men and three hundred horses, they\r\nall together could not have carried off at one time all the pearls of\r\nthis temple. We ought not to be too much astonished at this, if we\r\nconsider that the Indians of the province conveyed into these chests,\r\nduring many ages, all the pearls which they found, without retaining a\r\nsingle one of them.”[307] In the armory attached to this temple were\r\nlong pikes, maces, clubs, and other weapons mounted with links and\r\ntassels of pearls.\r\n\r\nGarcilasso has an interesting story of an incident said to have occurred\r\na few days after leaving Cofaciqui, when the troops were passing through\r\nthe wilderness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Negro pearling camp on bank of an Arkansas river\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Group of Arkansas pearl fishermen; photographed shortly after the\r\n    woman in the center of the group had found a pearl for which she\r\n    received $800\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Juan Terron, one of the stoutest soldiers of the army, toward noon,\r\n  drew from his saddle-bags about six pounds of pearls, and pressed a\r\n  cavalier, one of his friends, to take them. The cavalier thanked him\r\n  and told him that he ought to keep them, or rather, since the report\r\n  was current that the general would send to Havana, send them there\r\n  to buy horses and go no longer afoot. Offended at this answer,\r\n  Terron replied that “these pearls then shall not go any farther,”\r\n  and thereupon scattered them here and there upon the grass and\r\n  through the bushes. They were surprised at this folly, for the\r\n  pearls were as large as hazel-nuts, and of very fine water, and\r\n  because they were not pierced they were worth more than six thousand\r\n  ducats. They collected about thirty of these pearls, which were so\r\n  beautiful that it made them regret the loss of the others, and say,\r\n  in raillery, these words, which passed into a proverb with them,\r\n  “There are no pearls for Juan Terron.”[308]\r\n\r\nAt the capital of Iciaha, De Soto received from the cacique or chief, a\r\nstring, five feet in length, of beautiful and well-matched pearls as\r\nlarge as filberts. Upon De Soto’s expressing a desire to learn how the\r\ngems were extracted from the shells, the chief immediately ordered four\r\nboats to fish all night and return in the morning.\r\n\r\n  In the meantime they burnt a great deal of wood upon the shore, in\r\n  order to make there a great bed of live coals, that at the return of\r\n  the boats they might put thereon the shells, which would open with\r\n  the heat. They found, at the opening of the first shells, ten or\r\n  twelve pearls of the size of a pea, which they took to the cacique,\r\n  and to the general who was present, and who found them very\r\n  beautiful, except that the fire had deprived them of a part of their\r\n  lustre. When the general had seen what he wished, he returned to\r\n  dine; and immediately after, a soldier entered, who instantly said\r\n  to him that, in eating oysters which the Indians had caught, his\r\n  teeth had encountered a very beautiful pearl of a very lively color,\r\n  and that he begged him to receive it to send to the governess of\r\n  Cuba. Soto politely refused this pearl, and assured the soldier that\r\n  he was as obliged to him as if he had accepted it; and that some day\r\n  he would try to acknowledge his kindness, and the honor which he did\r\n  his wife; and that he should preserve it to purchase horses at\r\n  Havana. The Spaniards valued it at four hundred ducats; and as they\r\n  had not made use of fire to extract it, it had not lost any of its\r\n  lustre.[309]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the strong indorsement given to Garcilasso’s narrative\r\nby Theodore Irving and some other writers, his tendency to exaggerate\r\ndepreciates greatly the historical value of his account, and it seems\r\nwholly unreliable as an authority relative to early resources in\r\nAmerica. We may reasonably doubt whether De Soto’s expedition came in\r\ncontact with more pearls than those mentioned by Biedma and the\r\nPortuguese writer.\r\n\r\nThe account of the first voyage along the coast of the United States,\r\nthat of the Italian, Juan Verrazano, in 1524, contains no reference to\r\npearls, although he penetrated into the interior a score or two of\r\nmiles, and was frequently in contact with the natives, who lived largely\r\nby fishing, and who prized many ornaments of different colored stones,\r\ncopper rings, etc.\r\n\r\nThe first expedition which went far into the interior was the ill-fated\r\none under command of Pánfilo de Narvaez in 1528. A thrilling\r\naccount[310] of this journey was written by Cabeza de Vaca, who was one\r\nof the four survivors, after eight years’ wandering through America to\r\nMexico. Cabeza had been controller and royal treasurer of the\r\nexpedition, and in that position it was his particular duty to acquaint\r\nhimself with all the pearls, gold, and similar riches found by the\r\nparty. Notwithstanding his tradings with the Indians and their efforts\r\nto gain his friendship by means of presents, his account makes no\r\nmention of pearls, except to refer to a statement made by some Indians\r\nthat on the coast of the South Sea there were pearls and great riches.\r\n\r\nHernando D’Escalante Fontaneda, who was shipwrecked on the Florida coast\r\nabout 1550, and was detained there a prisoner for seventeen years,\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n  “Between Abolachi [Appalachicola] and Olagale is a river which the\r\n  Indians call Guasaca-Esqui, which means Reed River. It is on the\r\n  sea-coast, and at the mouth of this river the pearls are found in\r\n  oysters and other shells; from thence they are carried into all the\r\n  provinces and villages of Florida.”[311]\r\n\r\nThe European narrators also reported great stores of pearls along the\r\nAtlantic seaboard. Among the first of these may be mentioned David\r\nIngram, who is represented as traveling by land from the Gulf of Mexico\r\nto the vicinity of Cape Breton in the years 1568 and 1569. As it\r\nappeared in the first edition of Hakluyt’s Voyages, this relation\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n  “There is in some of those Countreys great abundance of Pearle, for\r\n  in every Cottage he founde Pearle, in some howse a quarte, in some a\r\n  pottel [half a gallon], in some a pecke, more or less, where he did\r\n  see some as great as an Acorn; and Richard Browne, one of his\r\n  Companyons, found one of these great Pearls in one of their Canoes,\r\n  or Boates, wch Pearls he gave to Mouns Campaine, whoe toke them\r\n  aboarde his shippe.”[312]\r\n\r\nEstimation of Ingram’s wonderful relation is decreased by Purchas’s\r\ncomment:\r\n\r\n  As for David Ingram’s perambulations to the north parts, Master\r\n  Hakluyt, in his first edition printed the same; but it seemeth some\r\n  incredibilities of his reports caused him to leave him out in the\r\n  next impression; the reward of lying being, not to be believed in\r\n  truths.[313]\r\n\r\nEven the members of Raleigh’s Roanoke Colony of 1585 reported pearls.\r\nHariot stated:\r\n\r\n  Sometimes in feeding on Muscles we found some Pearle: but it was our\r\n  happe to meet with ragges, or of a pide colour: not having yet\r\n  discovered those places where we heard of better and more plenty.\r\n  One of our company, a man of skill in such matters, had gathered\r\n  from among the Savage people about five thousand: of which number he\r\n  chooses so many as made a faire chaine, which for their likenesse\r\n  and uniformity in roundenesse, orientnesse, and piednesse of many\r\n  excellent colours, with equality in greatnesse, were very faire and\r\n  rare: and had therefore been presented to her Majesty, had we not by\r\n  casualty, and through extremity of a storme lost them, with many\r\n  things els in coming away from the countrey.[314]\r\n\r\nSo far as we can learn, there is no evidence to show that, during the\r\nsixteenth or the seventeenth century, any pearls of value were received\r\nin Europe from within the present limits of the United States, as was\r\nthe case with the resources of Venezuela, Panama and Mexico. Many of the\r\naccounts quoted above seem wholly fictitious, some of them possibly\r\ndrawn up for the purpose of promoting exploring expeditions. It is also\r\nprobable that knowledge of the enormous collections at Venezuela and\r\nPanama misled some of the narrators into recognizing as pearls the\r\nspherical pieces of shell or even the cylindrical wampum which the\r\nIndians made in large quantities and used as money.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is unquestionable that pearls of value were in the\r\npossession of some of the wealthier tribes. Biedma’s account of the 150\r\npounds or more of damaged pearls in the graves at Cofaciqui seems wholly\r\nreliable, and likewise many other statements; and it is an interesting\r\nproblem to determine the source from which the Indians obtained them.\r\n\r\nMost of the narratives refer to the pearls as coming from the coast of\r\nthe South Sea or Gulf of Mexico. The evidence of Fontaneda, who had\r\nspent seventeen years in the country, throws some light on this. He\r\nstates that pearls were obtained at the mouth of Reed River near\r\nAppalachicola, whence they were distributed throughout Florida. This\r\nseems to indicate that on the west coast of Florida there might have\r\nbeen extensive reefs of pearl-bearing mollusks, which have since become\r\nextinct, although existing shell-heaps do not confirm this.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible and even probable that many of these pearls in the\r\npossession of the Indians came from the Gulf of Mexico or even from the\r\nCaribbean Sea, it seems much more likely that they came largely from the\r\nUnios of the inland lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\nThe voyages of Narvaez, Ayllon, De Soto, Ribault, etc., had been so\r\nunfortunate that for a century little exploration was made in the\r\nterritory of the southern part of the United States. When this territory\r\nwas again invaded, little was seen in the way of pearls.\r\n\r\nIberville, who established the French settlement near the mouth of the\r\nMississippi in 1699, was specially directed to look for them. His\r\ninstructions state: “Although the pearls presented to his Majesty are\r\nnot fine either in water or shape, they must nevertheless be carefully\r\nsought, as better may be found, and his Majesty desires M. d’Iberville\r\nto bring all he can; ascertain where the fishery is carried on, and see\r\nit in operation.”[315] Pearls were found in the territory of the\r\nPascagoulas, but they were not worth the trouble of securing them. It\r\nappears that from these the Pearl River in Mississippi derived its name.\r\n\r\nThe only reference to pearls in the seventy-one volumes of Travels and\r\nExplorations of the Jesuit Missionaries in New France, from 1610 to\r\n1791, is a note by Father Gravier stating that he saw no choice pearls:\r\n“It is true the chief’s wife has some small pearls; but they are neither\r\nround nor well pierced, with the exception of seven or eight, which are\r\nas large as small peas, and have been bought for more than they are\r\nworth.”[316]\r\n\r\nDaniel Coxe’s description, in 1722, of pearl resources in America, is of\r\nspecial interest because of the extended experience of his father as a\r\ntrader in the country. He states:\r\n\r\n  Pearls are found to be in great abundance in this country; the\r\n  Indians put some value upon them, but not so much as on the colored\r\n  beads we bring them. On the whole coast of this province, for two\r\n  hundred leagues, there are many vast beds of oysters which breed\r\n  pearls, as has been found in divers places. But, which is very\r\n  remarkable, far from the sea, in fresh water rivers and lakes, there\r\n  is a sort of shell-fish between a mussel and a , wherein are found\r\n  abundance of pearls, and many of an unusual magnitude. The Indians,\r\n  when they take the oysters, broil them over the fire till they are\r\n  fit to eat, keeping the large pearls they find in them, which by the\r\n  heat are tarnished and lose their native lustre; but, when we have\r\n  taught them the right method, doubtless it would be a very\r\n  profitable trade. There are two places we already know within land,\r\n  in each of which there is a great pearl fishery. One about\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BROOCH, RENAISSANCE STYLE, SET WITH BAROQUE PEARLS, FROM AMERICAN\r\n    STREAMS\r\n\r\n  Pan-American Exposition, 1901\r\n]\r\n\r\n  one hundred and twenty leagues up the River Meschacebe\r\n  [Mississippi], on the west side, in a lake made by the river of the\r\n  Naches, about forty miles from its mouth, where they are found in\r\n  great plenty and many very large. The other on the River Chiaha,\r\n  which runs into the Coza or Cussaw River (as our English call it),\r\n  and which comes from the northeast, and, after a course of some\r\n  hundred miles, disembogues into the Gulf of Florida, about one\r\n  hundred miles to the east of the Meschacebe.[317]\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that the first place mentioned by Coxe as the\r\nlocation of a great pearl fishery is not far from one of the most\r\nproductive pearling regions of the last fifteen years, _viz._, the\r\neastern part of Arkansas. The second place noted by him appears to be\r\nidentical with the Iciaha, where, nearly two centuries before, the\r\nIndians exhibited the methods of their fishing to De Soto and his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nExcepting Coxe’s notice, for 250 years following 1600, little was heard\r\nof the occurrence of pearls within this country. This does not indicate\r\nnecessarily that the gems were absent from the waters; but, not using\r\nthe Unios for food as did the aborigines, the residents had little\r\noccasion to open them and in this way learn of their contents. And even\r\nwhere pearls were occasionally found in mollusks opened for fish-bait,\r\nthe people were in few instances informed as to their market value, and\r\ndid not attempt to sell them, although the most attractive ones may have\r\nbeen treasured as ornaments or as keepsakes. This was paralleled in the\r\ndiamond fields of South Africa, where gems worth thousands of dollars\r\nwere used as playthings by the farmers’ children. A jewel, like a\r\nprophet, is frequently without honor in its own country until the\r\nresidents of that country learn of the great esteem in which it is held\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in some localities a few pearls were collected from time to\r\ntime. The Moravians—familiar with the pearls of their native streams in\r\nEurope—gathered many from the Lehigh River near Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,\r\nover a century ago;[318] and from Rhode Island and elsewhere a few were\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe first awakening to a realization of the value of fresh-water pearls\r\nin America occurred fifty years ago, when several beautiful gems were\r\nmarketed from the northern part of New Jersey. The story of this find\r\nhas been frequently told. A shoemaker named David Howell, who lived on\r\nthe outskirts of Paterson, occasionally relieved the monotony of his\r\ntrade by a fishing excursion to some neighboring stream, where he would\r\nusually collect a “mess” of mussels. Returning from one of these visits\r\nto Notch Brook in the spring of 1857, the mussels were fried with the\r\nusual abundance of grease and heat. After this preparation, one of them\r\nwas found to contain a large, round pearl weighing “nearly 400 grains,”\r\nwhich possibly might have proven the finest of modern times, had not its\r\nluster and beauty been destroyed by the heat and grease.[319] Had the\r\npearl been discovered in time, its value might have exceeded $25,000,\r\nthus making poor Howell’s fried mussels one of the most expensive of\r\nsuppers.\r\n\r\nHoping to duplicate his wonderful find, Howell collected and searched\r\nother mussels, and his example was followed by several of his neighbors.\r\nWithin a few days a magnificent pink pearl was found by a Paterson\r\ncarpenter named Jacob Quackenbush. This weighed ninety-three grains, and\r\nwas bought by the late Charles L. Tiffany for Messrs. Tiffany & Co., New\r\nYork City, for $1500. Mr. Tiffany later described with much interest the\r\nfeelings he experienced after making the purchase. Said he: “Here this\r\nman finds a pearl within seventeen miles of our place of business! What\r\nif thousands should be found, and many perhaps finer than this one!\r\nHowever, we risked buying the pearl, and as no one in New York seemed\r\ninterested in it, we sent it to our Paris house for sale, and a French\r\ngem dealer offered for it a very large advance on the original price,\r\npaying 12,500 francs.” From this dealer it passed into the possession of\r\nthe young and beautiful Empress Eugénie, from whom and from its great\r\nluster it derived the name “Queen Pearl.” Its present market value would\r\ndoubtless amount to $10,000 or more.\r\n\r\nWhen news of the very large price received for Quackenbush’s find became\r\npublic, great excitement developed in the vicinity of Notch Brook.\r\nPersons came from all directions to search in the shallow streams for\r\nvaluable pearls. Farmers of the neighborhood tried their luck, and also\r\nmechanics and other residents of the adjacent villages and towns, and\r\neven some from Newark, Jersey City, and New York. An old resident, who\r\nwas an eye-witness, describes the scene as one of great animation, the\r\ncrowds of people and the horses and wagons along the shore giving “an\r\nappearance of camp-meeting time.” At least one schoolmaster in the\r\nvicinity is said to have closed his school to give his pupils an\r\nopportunity to engage in the hunt.\r\n\r\nWith trousers rolled up, the people waded into the shallow water and\r\nsought for the mussels in the mud and sand on the bottom. Many pearls\r\nwere secured, but none approached in size or value the two above\r\nnoted.[320] During 1857, the New York City market received about $15,000\r\nworth of pearls from these waters, and in addition many were sold\r\nlocally or retained as souvenirs of the hunt. At the low price of pearls\r\nexisting then, this figure would mean possibly ten times as much at\r\npresent, or $150,000.\r\n\r\nThe active search soon depleted the resources of the little stream, so\r\nthat in the following year the reported value of the yield was only a\r\nfew thousand dollars. The decrease continued until in a few years\r\npractically every mussel was removed, and at present scarcely a single\r\nUnio is to be found in these waters.\r\n\r\nThe interest in pearling extended far from the place of the original\r\nfind; and in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and even as far away as Texas, search\r\nwas made in the streams. In the Colorado and its tributaries, about\r\n20,000 were found in a short while. Most of these were small and\r\nunattractive, but a considerable number were reported “as large as\r\npepper-corns” and a few “the size of a small rifle ball,” the number\r\ndecreasing with the increase in size. A correspondent in the “Neue Zeit”\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n  Sometimes they are round, sometimes cylindrical, elliptical,\r\n  hemispherical, or of an altogether irregular shape. The finest have\r\n  a milk-white, silvery sheen; many, however, are reddish yellow,\r\n  bluish brown, or quite black; the last naturally have no value\r\n  whatever. As to their value, there is considerable uncertainty, and\r\n  it can easily be understood that those who have a great number of\r\n  them in their possession greatly overestimate them. So far they are\r\n  found principally in the Llano and the San Saba.[321]\r\n\r\nAfter the resources in northern New Jersey were depleted and the\r\nexcitement had died out, little was heard of pearling in this country\r\nuntil 1878, when many were found in Little Miami River in southwestern\r\nOhio. The fishing was carried on at low water, and principally by boys,\r\nwho would wade out in the water and feel for the mollusks with their\r\nfeet, and then bob under and pick them up with their hands. The senior\r\nauthor spent a day in this fishery with a party of six boys with some\r\nsuccess. During 1878 about $25,000 worth of pearls were collected in the\r\nvicinity of Waynesville on that stream. Mr. Israel H. Harris, a banker\r\nof Waynesville, then began collecting these pearls; and by purchasing\r\nduring several years nearly every interesting specimen found in the\r\nvicinity, he made his collection one of the largest and best known in\r\nthe country. When sold in 1888, it contained several thousand pearls,\r\nmostly of small size, averaging in weight little more than one grain\r\neach. A large portion of this collection was exhibited in the American\r\nsection of the Paris Exposition of 1889, and was awarded a gold medal.\r\nIncluded in this exhibit was a series of ornaments in which the gems\r\nwere arranged according to color, so that in one the pearls were green,\r\nin another purplish brown, in another pink, in another waxy white, and\r\nin one a cream-white. It also contained a button-shaped pearl weighing\r\nthirty-eight grains and several pink ones almost translucent. A pink\r\npearl of eight grains was admired by all who saw it; by reflected light\r\nthis had the color and translucency of a drop of molten silver. Many of\r\nthe pink pearls found in the Little Miami and its tributaries were of\r\nthe most beautiful rose-petal pink; pearls of this peculiar color have\r\nnever been found in any other waters.\r\n\r\nFrom Ohio the industry gradually extended westward and southward, and\r\nnew fields were developed, pearls to the value of about $10,000 annually\r\ncoming on the market from such widely separated States as Vermont,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Washington, etc. However, little\r\ngeneral interest was taken in fresh-water pearls, and few choice ones\r\nwere found until the magnificent resources of the upper Mississippi\r\nValley were discovered. Owing to the ease with which the mollusks may be\r\ncollected by wading, it was in the relatively shallow tributaries that\r\nthe fishery first developed, rather than in the deep channels of the\r\nmain stream and of the large affluents.\r\n\r\nThe first region in the Mississippi Valley to attract attention was\r\nsouthwestern Wisconsin. Early in the summer of 1889, many beautiful\r\npearls were found in Pecatonica River, a tributary of Rock River, which\r\nin turn empties into the Mississippi. Within three months, $10,000 worth\r\nof gems were sent from this region to New York City alone, including one\r\nworth $500, which was a very considerable sum for a fresh-water pearl at\r\nthat time. The interest quickly spread to neighboring waters, and within\r\na short time pearls were found also in Sugar River, in Apple River, in\r\nRock River, in Wisconsin River, and in the Mississippi in the vicinity\r\nof Prairie du Chien. The fact that little experience and no capital was\r\nrequired for the business drew large numbers of persons to the\r\nnewly-found Klondike; and the finds were so numerous and of such high\r\nquality that about $300,000 worth of pearls were collected before the\r\nend of 1891, greatly exceeding all records for fresh waters.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin pearls are remarkable for their beauty, luster, and\r\ndiversified coloring, and some lovely shades of pink, purple, and\r\nespecially metallic green have been found. Several of them have weighed\r\nin excess of fifty grains each, and some individual values ran well into\r\nfour figures. One shipment made from Sugar River to London in September,\r\n1890, contained ninety-three pearls, weighing from four to twenty-eight\r\ngrains each, for which £11,700 was received in payment. In the limits of\r\none county in the following year, pearls to the value of nearly $100,000\r\nwere secured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BROOCHES AND RINGS OF FRESH-WATER PEARLS FROM WISCONSIN AND TENNESSEE\r\n\r\n  Paris Exposition, 1900\r\n]\r\n\r\nShortly following the outbreak of pearling in Wisconsin came the\r\ndevelopment of interest in certain parts of Tennessee. For many years\r\npearls had been secured from the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers and\r\ntheir tributaries, especially Caney Fork, Duck, Calf Killer, and Elk\r\nrivers, the headquarters of the fishery and the local markets being\r\nCarthage, Smithville, Columbia, and Arlington. The search had been\r\nconducted in a moderate way by pleasure parties in the summer, and by\r\nfarmers after the crops had been laid aside.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 pearling excitement developed in the mountain regions of eastern\r\nTennessee, especially in Clinch River. These newly-discovered resources\r\nproved so valuable that the local interest became very great. Vivid and\r\npicturesque accounts published in the local papers reported hundreds of\r\npersons as camping at various points along the streams, some in tents\r\nand some in rough shanties, and others going from shoal to shoal in\r\nnewly-built house-boats. They were described as easygoing,\r\npleasure-loving people, the men, women, and children working hard all\r\nday, subsisting largely on fish caught in the same stream, and dancing\r\nat night to the music of a banjo around the camp-fires. The center of\r\nthe new industry was Clinton, the county seat of Anderson County,\r\nwhither the successful hunters betook themselves each Saturday, the\r\npreferred time for selling the catch.\r\n\r\nThe next outbreak of pearling excitement was in Arkansas, in the region\r\nreferred to by Daniel Coxe two centuries ago as the location of great\r\npearl resources.[322] Although in recent times little had been heard of\r\npearls in Arkansas previous to 1895, they were not unknown in that\r\nState. For years they had been picked up by the fishermen, and used as\r\nlucky stones or given to the children for playthings. Some had come into\r\nthe possession of persons acquainted with their value. About 1875, a few\r\npearls were collected by a party of men engaged in cutting cedar poles\r\non White River; in 1888, a brilliant pear-shaped pink pearl of\r\ntwenty-seven grains was secured from the same river, and sold to a\r\nprominent resident. Little had been said about these finds, and in\r\ngeneral the people of Arkansas had slight idea of the occurrence or the\r\nvalue of pearls in those waters.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, a surveying party on White River found pearls in the Unios of\r\nthat stream, and collected them to the value of about $5000. News of\r\nthis discovery attracted attention to the resource, and other persons\r\nsought for the gems in the White River and its tributaries, in the St.\r\nFrancis and the Arkansas rivers. The unusually low water in 1896\r\nfacilitated the fishery, and resulted in the discovery of many large and\r\nvaluable gems. The interest developed rapidly, and within twelve months\r\nnearly every stream of water in Arkansas yielded pearls, with the finds\r\nmost extensive and valuable in White River and its tributary the Black\r\nRiver, which has proved to be the richest pearling region in America.\r\nThe industry centered at Black Rock, more than a thousand persons\r\nfishing within twenty miles of that place. It is estimated that within\r\nthree years following the development of this fishery, this State\r\nyielded pearls to the value of more than $500,000.\r\n\r\nWhen the Arkansas fishery was at its height, it was reported that ten\r\nthousand persons were employed therein. The fishermen were from nearly\r\nevery class and condition in the State. Women were not absent; even\r\nchildren participated in the industry, and some proved more fortunate\r\nthan the older hunters. It was not uncommon to see several hundred\r\npersons congregated at one bar or in one stretch of the river, all\r\nintent on making a fortune, and all occupied in fishing or in opening\r\nthe shells. So complete was the absorption of the people in this\r\npursuit, and so many of the farm-hands were occupied in the eager search\r\nfor anticipated fortunes, that the local papers reported much\r\napprehension and difficulty in harvesting the cotton and other crops.\r\n\r\nWithin the main channel of the Mississippi, the relative scarcity of\r\npearls in the Unios, and the greater preparation required for collecting\r\nthe mollusks in the deep waters, retarded the fishery until the\r\nestablishment of button manufacture afforded a market for the shells,\r\nthis originating in 1891. The industry developed rapidly, and for\r\nseveral years has consumed about 35,000 tons of shells annually,\r\nobtained principally in the Mississippi between Quincy and La Crosse,\r\nand to a much less extent in other streams in this valley. This is more\r\nthan twice the total product of mother-of-pearl shell in all parts of\r\nthe world. However, the value per ton is very much less than that of the\r\nbest grade of mother-of-pearl; that from Australia, for instance,\r\ncommonly selling for $1200 per ton, whereas the Mississippi shell\r\nusually sells for less than $20, although the very choicest may bring\r\nupward of $50 per ton.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of shells for manufacture has extended to many of the\r\nlarge tributaries of the Mississippi, especially the Arkansas, the\r\nWhite, the St. Francis, the Ohio and the Illinois rivers, and this\r\nindustry has added largely to the pearl yield in these waters.\r\n\r\nIn the last three years, the scenes of greatest activity have been the\r\nWabash River and its tributaries, where shell-collecting developed in\r\n1903, and the Illinois River, where the industry was of little\r\nimportance previous to 1906. On the Wabash, camps were established at\r\nalmost every town, from the mouth up to St. Francis, Illinois, and about\r\none thousand persons found employment. Some of the most beautiful\r\nAmerican gems have come from this river. They are usually silvery white\r\nin color and of the sweetest luster. A single pearl weighing only ten\r\ngrains has been sold at the river for $1000; but it is frequently the\r\ncase that a fine gem will sell for more at the place where found than in\r\nthe great markets. During the spring of 1907, three pearls were found in\r\nthe Wabash near Vincennes, which weighed forty-one, fifty-one, and\r\nfifty-three grains respectively. One of these was white, one faint pink,\r\nand the third was yellow. The finest pearls have been reported from the\r\nvicinity of Mount Carmel near the lower end of the river. Very large\r\nquantities of baroques or slugs are found in the Wabash and the\r\nIllinois; 30,000 ounces were reported from those rivers and their\r\ntributaries in 1907, for which the fishermen received a total of\r\n$50,000. A large symmetrical pearl found during 1907 weighed a trifle\r\nunder 150 grains, and a slug was found which weighed fully one ounce, or\r\n606 grains.\r\n\r\nThe pearl-hunting excitement has been felt even on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard, as a result of the publication of the discoveries in the\r\nMississippi Valley. In Maine many pearls have been reported, especially\r\nin the vicinity of Moosehead Lake. In 1901 over one hundred were found\r\nin that vicinity; most of them were of little value, but more than a\r\ndozen were worth $10 or $15 each. Three found by Kineo guides were sold\r\nfor an aggregate of $300. The choicest one reported in that year weighed\r\ntwelve and one half grains and sold for $150; had it been perfect in\r\nform and luster its value would have been several times that amount.\r\nMost of these pearls were found by Moosehead guides, who found\r\npurchasers among the visiting fishermen and hunters.\r\n\r\nSince 1901 many farm-boys as well as guides have devoted much attention\r\nto the business, some of them deriving as large a revenue therefrom as\r\nfrom the use of the rifle. Good finds have been made, during the last\r\nyear or two especially. In 1906, one choice pearl sold for $700, and\r\nmany have sold for $10 to $75 each. The search has proven so alluring\r\nthat returning visitors have complained that some of the guides care to\r\ndo little more than search every rill, brook, and creek they come across\r\nlooking for the mollusks. Just at present the principal attention seems\r\nto be directed to the streams in the western part of Maine, where the\r\nriver-beds are more sandy and the shell-fish more abundant than in the\r\nnorthern and eastern part of the State.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts pearls have been collected from many of the ponds and\r\nbrooks. In Nonesuch Pond in Weston, the _Unio complanata_ has yielded\r\nmany small ones of attractive appearance, but not of sufficient size or\r\nluster to sell for more than $10 each. Ponds in the town of Greenwich\r\nand also in Pelham in Hampshire County are among the best in\r\nMassachusetts for pearls. The Sudbury River above Concord also yields\r\nmany. Relatively few of the Unios contain pearls, and the gem-bearing\r\nindividuals seem to be grouped in special localities. Outside of these\r\nplaces, thousands of mussels may be opened without revealing a single\r\ngem. A collection of small Massachusetts pearls was brought together a\r\nfew years ago by Mr. Sherman F. Denton of Wellesley Farms, who has\r\ndevoted much time to exploring the inland waters of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nConnecticut also has had a slight touch of the pearl fever. In 1897, Mr.\r\nC. S. Carwell of Ledyard, explored the headwaters of Mystic River, and\r\nin a few weeks collected a number of pearls, one of which he is reported\r\nas having sold for $500, and two others were estimated at $400 each. And\r\nfrom the other end of the State, along the Shepaug River, is reported a\r\nsimilar account of the success of Mr. Arlo Kinney of Steep Rock.\r\nAttracted by these reports, crowds of seekers have proceeded in the\r\nusual reckless manner to make wholesale destruction of the mollusks. The\r\nfinds have been especially large and valuable in the lakes and streams\r\nof Litchfield County, particularly in Bantam Lake.\r\n\r\nIn New York State, pearls have been found in the swift shallow streams\r\nin the Adirondack region, and in several of those entering the St.\r\nLawrence, particularly the Grass River in St. Lawrence County. Pearls\r\nwere first reported from this region in 1894. In 1896 the Grass yielded\r\none pearl weighing fifty-eight grains, worth $600 locally; and in 1897\r\none weighing sixty-eight grains was found, the fisherman selling it for\r\n$800. A resident of Russell township devoted most of his time to\r\npearling in Grass River during 1896 and 1897, from which he is said to\r\nhave realized $2000. In this region the mussels are found by wading in\r\nthe shallow water and scanning the bottom through a water-telescope.\r\nMost of the pearls are of slight value, but many individuals are\r\nreported as worth from $30 to $60 each.\r\n\r\nPearl River in Rockland County, New York, has furnished a number of\r\nbrown pearls. These are commonly small, weighing from one eighth to one\r\nhalf grain each, although some weigh seven or eight grains each. Most of\r\nthese are not lustrous, but occasionally a bright brown or a bright\r\ncopper-brown specimen of from one to four grains is met with. At the\r\nParis Exposition, in 1900, were exhibited one hundred of these pearls,\r\nwith an aggregate weight of 281 grains; these now form part of the\r\nMorgan-Tiffany Collection, in the American Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\nEven in the rich coal regions of Pennsylvania pearls are found. Possibly\r\nthe most productive section in that State has been the headwaters of the\r\nSchuylkill River in the vicinity of Tamaqua, Quakake, and Mahony City.\r\nOf the tributaries of the Schuylkill, those contributing largely to the\r\nyield have been Lewiston, Nipert, Still, Locust, and Hecla. These rise\r\nin the mountains and are rivulets of fair size by the time they reach\r\ntheir common outlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PEARL-BEARING UNIOS\r\n\r\n  From the Mississippi Valley\r\n\r\n  The upper pictures show the two valves of the same shell, and the\r\n    pearl is detachable\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe original pearl finds in the Schuylkill date from half a century ago,\r\nwhen they were secured by farmers who used the mussel shells in removing\r\nhair from the hides of slaughtered pigs. During the Mississippi pearling\r\nexcitement in 1897, several persons from New York, who were summering in\r\nSchuylkill County, searched the small streams for pearl-bearing mussels\r\nwith such success that within a short while many farmers became\r\nenthusiastic hunters during their spare time. Half a dozen or more men\r\ndid very well, their catch amounting to thousands of dollars’ worth. Mr.\r\nFrank M. Ebert, of Quakake, has put most of his spare time in the\r\nbusiness in the last ten years, and has secured many good pearls. It is\r\nestimated that the total catch in Schuylkill County alone approximates\r\n$20,000 at local values. So actively has the search been conducted that\r\nat present few adult mussels of the pearl-bearing species remain, and a\r\nday’s work may result in finding less than a dozen.\r\n\r\nThe best price reported as received by a local fisherman was $200 for a\r\ntwenty-grain pearl in the year 1904. Many individual specimens have been\r\nsold at prices ranging from $100 to $175. It is claimed that a pearl\r\nsold by a fisherman in Schuylkill for fifty cents was later marketed in\r\nPhiladelphia for $125, and with slight mounting was ultimately sold for\r\n$1600. The most attractive weigh from ten to twenty grains each; larger\r\nones have been found, weighing up to thirty-eight grains, but as a rule\r\nthe luster is not so good as that possessed by pearls of medium size.\r\nThe common colors are dark blue, pink, lavender, and white. A few are\r\nblack and some are brown. The brown pearls are seldom of value, owing to\r\ndeficiency in luster.\r\n\r\nIn Maryland pearls have been collected from the brooks near the head of\r\nChesapeake Bay, and especially in Kent and Cecil counties. These are of\r\nalmost every conceivable color, ranging from a clear white to a dainty\r\npink, and to very dark colors, especially bronze and copper. Most of\r\nthem are too small for commercial value, and only a few reach sufficient\r\nsize to command more than $5 or $10 each, but single specimens have sold\r\nas high as $50.\r\n\r\nGeorgia has yielded some pearls, chiefly in the vicinity of Rome, at the\r\njunction of the Etowah and Oostanaula rivers. This is believed to be the\r\nsite of the Indian town Cofaciqui, where, in his memorable expedition of\r\n1540–1541, De Soto found the natives in possession of so many pearls.\r\nThe general news of finds in the Mississippi Valley stirred up local\r\ninterest in this region in 1897, and when the streams were low and clear\r\nin the autumn many persons engaged in hunting the mussels. An ex-sheriff\r\nof Rome is reported as having secured about fifty pearls, lustrous but\r\nirregular. A few miles above Rome, a farmer made a trial on Johns Creek,\r\na tributary of the Oostanaula; and from a basketful of Unios he reports\r\nfinding several marketable pearls for which he received $180 from a\r\nBaltimore jeweler. Others followed, and many fine specimens were\r\nsecured. Unios are especially abundant in the Flint, Ocmulgee, and\r\nOconee rivers, and it seems probable that many pearls might be found in\r\nthese streams.\r\n\r\nFlorida has not yet been actively exploited, but it may prove a\r\nproductive region ere long. The reports of De Soto’s expedition make\r\nspecial reference to the size and beauty of the pearls found at a point\r\nwhere he crossed the Ocklocknee River about thirty miles above its\r\nmouth, near the present site of Langston, Wakulla County. And there\r\nseems little doubt that pearls may be found in the Ocklocknee and also\r\nin its affluent, the Sopchoppy River. The banks of these streams are\r\nfull of shells, and pearls of choice color have been sent from there.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to refer in detail to the origin of pearling in each\r\nof the States. The general interest in this industry from 1889 to the\r\npresent time has resulted in the examination of most of the rivers and\r\ncreeks, and in few has the search been entirely unrewarded, although the\r\nfinds have been relatively much greater in some waters than in others.\r\nAs a rule, pearl-bearing Unios are most numerous in clear, swift\r\nstreams, with sandy or gravelly bottoms and which flow through\r\ncalcareous rocks. With pearlers as with miners, there is a stampede to\r\nthe places where a good find is reported, since the rivers are free for\r\nall; consequently, there is much variation from year to year in the\r\namount of attention which the individual streams and localities receive.\r\n\r\nWhile many of the pearlers operating in the Mississippi River are\r\nprofessional fishermen or rivermen, most of those in the smaller streams\r\nhave had no previous experience in similar work. Frequently whole\r\nfamilies come twenty or thirty miles, and even greater distances, and\r\ncamp on the river bank. In many instances farm-hands are there who have\r\nabandoned their crops, mechanics who have left steady jobs, railway men\r\nwho have taken a lay-off, teachers, merchants, all eager and expecting\r\nto find a fortune. In some localities, pearl fishing has been used as an\r\nattraction in big picnic advertisements, and has drawn larger crowds\r\nthan a public orator.\r\n\r\nThe mollusks are removed from the river bottoms in various ways and by\r\nmany forms of apparatus. In the shallow streams the fishermen simply\r\nwade out in the water and pick up the shells by hand. If not readily\r\nvisible from the surface, the shells may be located with the bare feet\r\nor by the use of a water-telescope. Where the water is too deep for\r\nwading, the fishermen work from small boats, and use garden rakes or\r\nother convenient inplements.\r\n\r\nWhere pearling has developed into more of an industry, special forms of\r\nrakes and drags are employed. A shoulder rake, with a handle twelve to\r\ntwenty feet in length, is used extensively under the ice in frozen\r\nrivers, and in lakes and other places where the water is still and from\r\neight to fifteen feet in depth. This is simply an overgrown or enlarged\r\ngarden rake, armed with twelve or fifteen iron teeth about five inches\r\nin length. A wire scoop or basket is attached to receive the catch as it\r\nis pulled from the bottom by the teeth, and when this scoop is well\r\nfilled it is lifted and the contents dumped on the ice or into the\r\nskiff. This method is laborious, and is employed only where the water is\r\nshallow and the mollusks are abundant. Scissor tongs—similar to those\r\nused by oystermen on the Atlantic coast—are also employed in some\r\nlocalities, especially in Arkansas, where it is estimated that 1700\r\npairs were manufactured and sold in 1899 and 1900, at about $7 each.\r\n\r\nIn the large streams of the Mississippi Valley, with their slow and\r\nsteady currents, and where the Unios are taken largely for their shells\r\nto be used in button manufacture, the most popular form of apparatus\r\nsince 1896 has been the crowfoot drag. This ingenious contrivance\r\nconsists of a cross-bar of hollow iron tubing or common gas-pipe, six or\r\neight feet long, to which are attached, at intervals of five or six\r\ninches, stout twine or chain snoods or stagings, each about eighteen\r\ninches in length. To each of these are attached three or four prongs or\r\n“hooks,” about six inches apart. These “hooks” are four-pronged, and are\r\nmade of two pieces of stout wire bent at right angles to each other.\r\nAccording to the depth of the water, from twenty-five to seventy-five\r\nfeet of three quarter inch rope is attached to the drag for the purpose\r\nof towing it behind the boat, which is permitted to drift down the\r\nstream with the current. This contrivance costs about $3, and each\r\nfisherman generally has at least two of them, as well as a wide\r\nflat-bottom boat costing $5 or $10.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the current is light, the fisherman prepares a “mule” to\r\nassist the boat in towing the resisting drag. This “mule” consists of a\r\nwooden frame, hinged in V-shape, and is fastened several feet in advance\r\nof the boat with the V end pointed down the stream. It sinks low in the\r\nwater, and the current pressing against the angle carries it along, and\r\nthus tows the skiff and the resisting drag at a uniform rate of speed.\r\nWhen there is not sufficient current even for this contrivance, as in\r\nthe wide reaches and in the lakes, oars, sails, and even power engines\r\nmay be used for propelling the boat.\r\n\r\nAs the crowfoot drag is slowly drawn along the bottom, it comes in\r\ncontact with the mollusks feeding with open shells. When a hook or other\r\npart of the drag enters an open shell, the mollusk immediately closes\r\nfirmly upon the intruding object and clings thereto long enough to be\r\ndrawn up into the boat. In this way, where the Unios are thick, nearly\r\nevery hook becomes freighted, and some may have two or three shells\r\nclinging thereto. It is easy to collect fifty mollusks in passing over a\r\nlength of two hundred feet. Two drags are carried by each fisherman, and\r\nthe second one is put overboard as soon as the first one is ready to be\r\nraised. This is suspended with the bar across two upright forks on\r\neither side of the boat with the prongs swinging freely, and the mussels\r\nare removed therefrom. When this operation is completed, the drag is put\r\noverboard and the other one is ready for lifting. This apparatus is very\r\neffective, and as much as a ton of shells has been taken by one man in\r\ntwelve hours, but the average is very much less, probably not over four\r\nor five hundred pounds. Objection is made to this manner of fishing,\r\nsince many mollusks not brought to the surface are so injured that they\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nA cruder implement of similar type has long been employed on many\r\nlogging streams. The weighted branch of a tree is dragged on the bottom\r\nbehind a raft of logs, and the mussels attach themselves to the twigs in\r\nthe same manner as on the crowfoot hooks.\r\n\r\nDuring the pearling excitement in Arkansas, a considerable portion of\r\nthe choice pearls were found, not in the mussels, but lying loosely in\r\nthe mud of the shores, indicating that under some circumstances, as\r\nagitation by freshets or floods, the loose pearls are shaken out from\r\nthe Unios. In some instances, indeed, the pearls were found upon or in\r\nthe soil at some distance from streams or lakes. It is reported that in\r\nOctober, 1897, Mr. J. W. McIntosh, of the northern part of Lonoke\r\nCounty, while digging post-holes in the old bed of Cypress Bayou, found\r\na number of pearls, some “as large as a 44–caliber Winchester ball,”\r\nlying within the shells at a depth of a foot and a half below the\r\nsurface. This peculiar occurrence is partly explained by the wide\r\nextension of the waters in flood times over the low region, and by the\r\nshifting of streams and the isolation of cut-offs.\r\n\r\nStray pearls have been found in many other odd places, as in the viscera\r\nof chickens and ducks, in the stomachs of fish, and even within a pig’s\r\nmouth. It is not an uncommon scene in the pearling region to see men\r\nraking over the muck in hog-pens along the river banks, hoping there to\r\nfind a stray pearl lost from the mussels with which the animals had been\r\nfed by persons who had indeed “cast pearls before swine.” It is related\r\nthat a Negro near Marley, Illinois, in this way secured a pearl weighing\r\n118 grains, for which he received $2000 from a St. Louis buyer, and\r\nwhich was ultimately sold to a New York dealer for $5000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pearling scene on White River, Arkansas\r\n\r\n  The fishermen are using scissor tongs from flat-bottom skiffs\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pearling camp on upper Mississippi River\r\n\r\n  Crowfoot drags are shown on the flat-bottom skiffs at the river bank\r\n]\r\n\r\nDuring the height of the Arkansas pearling excitement in 1897, the\r\nspeculative spirit was so rife that many persons—unwilling to engage in\r\nthe labor of fishing—purchased unopened mussels from the fishermen in\r\nthe venture for aleatory profits. The price for these ranged from\r\ntwenty-five cents to $2 per hundred, and fluctuated rapidly, according\r\nto the immediate results, increasing several hundred per cent. in a few\r\nminutes under the influence of a valuable find. One fisherman sold\r\nmussels to the value of $28 in one day, and thought he had made an\r\nexcellent bargain until over $1000 worth of pearls were revealed when\r\nthe shells were opened.\r\n\r\nWhile some pearlers work in southern streams throughout the year,\r\ngenerally the season is coincident with warm weather, when the water is\r\nlow and the work may be conducted with comfort. In the vicinity of\r\nMuscatine and Rock Island about twelve years ago, large quantities of\r\nUnios were taken during the winter when the river was frozen over, the\r\nmen working with long rakes from the surface of the ice.\r\n\r\nWhen only a few mollusks are taken, they are readily opened with a knife\r\nto permit a search for the pearls. But where there are many, as in the\r\nMississippi River, the opening is facilitated by heating. After a\r\nsufficient catch has been obtained, they are subjected to the action of\r\nsteam in a box, or they are heated in an ordinary kettle; a few minutes\r\nof steaming or cooking are sufficient to cause the shells to spring\r\nopen. The fleshy parts are removed and thoroughly searched, the interior\r\nsurfaces of the shells are likewise examined for attached pearls, and\r\nthe liquid at the bottom of the vessel is strained so that nothing of\r\nvalue may escape.\r\n\r\nThis cooking is a convenient method of opening the shells, but\r\nunquestionably it injures the quality of many pearls. In some instances\r\nwhen the shells open, the pearls fall out and descend to the heated iron\r\nbottom, where they are quickly injured. The surface of one exposed too\r\nlong to the heat shows numerous minute cracks, which increase in number\r\nand size when subjected to changes of temperature. Some choice gems have\r\nin this manner been rendered almost valueless. If a jacket boiler, or\r\none with a double bottom, were used, there would be less danger of\r\ninjuring the pearls; or a similar result could be accomplished by\r\nplacing a wire screen a few inches above the bottom.\r\n\r\nSeveral fishermen have endeavored to devise mechanical methods for\r\nremoving the pearls and thus avoid the painstaking search among the\r\nflesh tissues now necessary; but these contrivances have not proved\r\nsatisfactory, and have not been employed except experimentally.\r\n\r\nIn the Mississippi and its tributaries, where the fishery is very\r\nextensive, after the pearls have been secured, the shells are sold to\r\nbutton manufacturers and to exporters at prices ranging from $4 to $40\r\nper ton, according to species, quality, and market conditions. This\r\nprovides a fairly remunerative income to the fishermen even if no pearls\r\nwhatever are found. But in the small tributaries and where the mollusks\r\nare less numerous, the shells are of little value owing to the expense\r\nof bringing them together and conveying them to market.\r\n\r\nNot every mollusk contains a pearl, and the village belle, intent on her\r\nevening toilet, need not buy a bushel of clams with the pleasant\r\nanticipation of finding a sufficient number of gems for a necklace.\r\nSmall and irregular pearls are not at all uncommon, but choice ones are\r\ndecidedly scarce, and each one represents the destruction of tens of\r\nthousands of mollusks. Quantities of irregular and imperfect nodules\r\nknown as slugs are collected, which sell for only a few dollars per\r\nounce. In some sections of the Mississippi, the slugs are so very\r\nnumerous that their aggregate value exceeds that of the choice pearls.\r\n\r\nIn the Mississippi, the percentage of pearls found in a definite\r\nquantity of mollusks is less than in the tributary streams, yet the much\r\ngreater quantity of shells collected raises the total yield to a very\r\nconsiderable amount. Pearling is subordinate and incidental to gathering\r\nthe shells for manufacture. In that length of the river from St. Paul to\r\nSt. Louis, a fair average yield to the fishermen is about fourteen\r\ndollars’ worth of pearls and slugs to each ton of shells. Of course,\r\nthis is not the individual experience, for a single Unio may contain a\r\ngem worth $5000, and on the other hand several tons of shells may yield\r\nonly a few cents’ worth of baroques. The market for the shells places\r\nthe Mississippi fishing upon an industrial basis, and guarantees a\r\nsubstantial income to every fisherman even when no pearls whatever are\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nUnios from the upper part of the Mississippi yield a much greater\r\npercentage than those from below Davenport. In 1904, for instance, from\r\nthe 4331 tons of shells taken in Wisconsin the fishermen secured pearls\r\nwhich they sold for $91,345, an average of $21 per ton; from the 822\r\ntons in Minnesota the average was $16 per ton; in Iowa the average was\r\n$12 for each of the 7846 tons; in Illinois, $5 per ton for the 2364\r\ntons, and in Missouri less than $1 worth of pearls was secured by the\r\nfishermen for each ton of shells which they took in the year named. A\r\nlarge number of choice pearls weighing over thirty grains each were\r\nfound in the vicinity of Prairie du Chien and McGregor. Within a river\r\nlength of one hundred miles in that region, the fishermen in 1904\r\ngathered pearls which ultimately sold for $300,000. It is therefore\r\napparent that the returns vary greatly in the different regions;\r\nnevertheless, even in the less productive localities fine pearls are\r\nsometimes found, which contribute to make the industry a profitable one.\r\n\r\nSuccess in pearling is like that in mining. In the White River in\r\nArkansas, for instance, one man found $4200 worth in one month. Another\r\ndiscovered a $50 pearl in the first shell he opened. A Negro found an\r\n$85 pearl the first day he worked, while another fisherman worked seven\r\nmonths and secured less than $10 worth. It is a question of finding or\r\nnot finding; the finding brings riches sometimes, and though the\r\nfailures reduce the average profits as low as in other local ventures,\r\nthe big prizes affect the mind, and the average is lost to sight. Taking\r\nthe country as a whole, it is probable that the total find has been\r\nsufficient to pay the average fisherman little if any more than $1 for\r\neach day’s work.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water pearls range in size from that of the smallest seed to\r\nthat of a pearl weighing several hundred grains. There is relatively\r\nonly a small quantity of seed-pearls, especially when compared with the\r\noutput in the fisheries of Ceylon and Persia. Possibly this is due\r\nlargely to a scarcity of the parasites which seem to perform so\r\nimportant a function in the regions noted. A further reason may be found\r\nin the manner in which the mollusks are opened and searched. Were the\r\nCeylon method of opening employed here—which, however, is not at all\r\npracticable—it seems probable that the quantity of seed-pearls found in\r\nthis country would be greatly increased.\r\n\r\nThe pearls from the tributaries of the Mississippi are noted for their\r\ngreat range of coloration. From a dead white, the color is gradually\r\nenhanced to faint shades of pink, yellow, or salmon tints, then to a\r\nmore decided form of these. From the light shades, the range extends to\r\npurple and to bright copper red, closely resembling a drop of molten\r\ncopper. Some are very light green; others rose, steel blue, or russet\r\nbrown, while purplish and very dark brown are not uncommon. White pearls\r\nare probably the most numerous; but pink, bronze, and lavender are by no\r\nmeans rare.\r\n\r\nA large percentage of the Mississippi River pearls are very irregular in\r\nform, many of them resembling dogs’ teeth, birds’ wings, the heads or\r\nbodies of different animals, etc.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the fresh-water pearls do not rank so high in value as those\r\nfrom oriental seas, since ordinarily they are not so lustrous. However,\r\nsome of them have sold at very high figures. A round pearl weighing 103\r\ngrains, found in Black River, Arkansas, in 1904, was eventually sold for\r\n$25,000; and one of 68 grains, found, in 1907, on the Wisconsin side of\r\nthe Mississippi River, was recently marketed at $15,000.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest American pearl necklaces, brought together in 1904,\r\nconsisted of thirty-eight pearls weighing 1710 grains in the aggregate,\r\nan average of 45 grains for each pearl. The central gem weighed 98½\r\ngrains and those on the left of it respectively 85¾, 79⅝, 65¼, 59⅝, 49⅜,\r\n46¼, 45⅛, 43¾, 41½, 40½, 40⅝, 35⅛, 37⅝, 30, 25⅛, 22¼, 20¼, and 19\r\ngrains. The pearls on the right were graduated as follows: 85¼, 76⅛,\r\n64⅞, 59½, 47¼, 46, 45⅛, 44½, 42½, 41¾, 38, 37⅞, 36, 35, 34⅝, 29½, 25¼,\r\n21, and 20⅜, grains. This necklace was exhibited at the St. Louis\r\nWorld’s Fair. It was sold to a London merchant, who in turn sold it to a\r\nParisian dealer, and it was finally purchased by a Spanish nobleman at a\r\nprice said to be about 500,000 francs.\r\n\r\nAnother necklace shown at the St. Louis World’s Fair, was of American\r\nfresh-water pearls from the rivers of Arkansas. The total weight of\r\nthese pearls, sixteen in number, was 861⅝ grains, an average of 61½\r\ngrains for each pearl. Of these one drop pearl weighed 77 grains, and\r\ntwo others each 65½ grains. A round pearl of 70 grains completed the\r\nadornment of the pendant. The circlet consisted of ten round pearls\r\nalternating with precious stones. The central pearl weighed 98½ grains\r\nand on each side were two of 61 grains, then two of 56 grains, two of\r\n54⅞, and two of 48 grains, one of 45⅜ grains being at the back of the\r\nnecklace.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of pearl hunting in American streams, the fishermen\r\nhad little idea of their value, and sold choice gems for insignificant\r\nsums. In 1887, a fisherman on Rock River, Illinois, found a 40–grain\r\npearl which he carried in his pocket for several months. Showing it one\r\nday in Davenport, he was offered $20 for it. He quickly accepted the\r\noffer, and on his return home told his friends about “the sucker who\r\ngave $20 for the shell slug.” At present this “shell slug” is worth more\r\nthan one hundred times that amount. Numerous instances of a similar\r\nnature occurred until the average fisherman lost all confidence in his\r\njudgment as to the values, and extravagant ideas prevailed regarding\r\neven almost worthless nacreous concretions. Thus, when a choice pearl is\r\nfound, an exorbitant price is set upon it and the seller feels for the\r\nmarket value by repeated dickerings with several buyers. And unless one\r\nis an expert, he is quite likely to pay two or three times as much for a\r\npearl at the river bank as in a metropolitan market. Some of the\r\nfishermen collect everything in the shape of nacreous concretions, and\r\nvery often pearl buyers in New York and elsewhere receive packages which\r\nare not worth the postage; in many other packages nine tenths of the lot\r\nis worthless; and the practical joker and the swindler have solicited\r\nbids on bright marbles, rounded pieces of pearl shell, and even\r\nsugar-coated pills.\r\n\r\nWhile many pearls of fine luster and beautiful and regular form have\r\nbeen derived from these fisheries, it occasionally happens, in the case\r\nof pearls consigned to the city pearl dealer, that cracks, breaks or\r\nmarks, which might detract from their value, are closed or removed,\r\neither by means of water or oil, the pearls having been kept in one or\r\nthe other until a few moments before they were shown to the merchant.\r\nPearls worth hundreds of dollars have sometimes shown breaks, and in one\r\ninstance a pearl valued at $7000 showed these cracks even a very short\r\ntime after the sale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE EVOLUTION OF BUTTONS, MADE FROM MISSISSIPPI SHELLS\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn many of the pearling regions of the Mississippi Valley, inquiry of\r\nalmost any fisherman will result in his bringing forth from an inside\r\npocket a small box padded with raw cotton and containing an assortment\r\nof pearls and slugs. Most of the slugs he will sell at prices ranging\r\nfrom fifty cents to $5 per ounce, for several of the small pearls he\r\nwill likely ask from $2 to $20 each, and one or two of the largest he\r\nmay value at $50 or more. At very rare intervals, a choice pearl will be\r\nfound, for which he may expect anywhere from $200 to $5000.\r\n\r\nWhile the highest prices are not received by the fishermen, there are\r\nmany who have been so fortunate as to obtain $1000 or more for a single\r\npearl, and several have received double that amount. Probably the\r\nhighest figure obtained by the original finder was $3800,\r\nnotwithstanding exaggerated stories of enormous five-figure prices.\r\nRecently the press credited a lad sixteen years of age with securing\r\n$20,000 for a pearl he had found.\r\n\r\nA particularly striking yarn relative to a so-called “Queen Mary” pearl\r\nwent the rounds of the press some time ago. According to the newspaper\r\nreport, this pearl was found by the wife of a fisherman who was a\r\ncripple or something equally pathetic, and, fortunately, when the family\r\nresources were at the lowest. With tears of joy, the fisherman embraced\r\nhis wife and told her it was her very own and she should wear it.\r\nHowever, by means of a check for $17,500, he was induced to part with\r\nit, but only on condition that it be named Queen Mary in honor of the\r\nhard-working wife. The report continues that the original buyer sold it\r\nfor $25,000, and at last accounts it was held by a Chicago dealer who\r\nhad “refused $40,000 and probably would not accept $50,000 for it.” The\r\nfacts seem to be that this pearl, which was found near Prairie du Chien\r\nin 1901 and weighed 103 grains, was originally sold for $250, and the\r\nlocal buyer sold it in Chicago for $550, where for many months it was\r\noffered at $1000.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of stories of valuable finds are told in the pearling regions:\r\nstories of mortgages that have been released, of homes bought, of\r\ncollege educations secured from the proceeds of a single gem; but these\r\ntales are offset by the untold stories of the undermining of fine,\r\nstrong character in awaiting the turn of fortune which never comes. The\r\npublic is quickly apprised of the valuable finds, but it does not hear\r\nof the time and labor lost by the hundreds who are unsuccessful.\r\nPearling excitement has many of the features of a mining craze. While a\r\nfew are benefited, hundreds are made poorer, and in many instances\r\nreduced to absolute want. Persons have given up their established\r\nbusiness to devote their time to pearling, staking all on the aleatory\r\nprofits, and have squandered days and months in the hope that one great,\r\nimmense, all-rewarding find will be made. The monotony of continued\r\ndisappointment is occasionally brightened by the news that some\r\none—possibly a near neighbor—has made a lucky find, and then the work is\r\ncontinued with renewed enthusiasm. A spirit akin to that which dominates\r\nthe gambler takes possession of the fisherman, and the days go on and\r\nthe seasons go by while the gem that is to bring the fortune still\r\neludes him. In many localities the pursuit yields far less profit than\r\npleasure, and many a man who spends a summer in pearling is in a fair\r\nway to spend the winter at the expense of some one else.\r\n\r\nThe pearls are collected for the trade by a score or more of buyers, who\r\nvisit the fisheries at intervals and purchase of the individual\r\nfishermen by personal dickering and bargaining. The buyers endeavor to\r\nkeep informed of all choice pearls discovered, and when an especially\r\nvaluable find is reported each one endeavors to have the first chance to\r\nsecure it. The principal local centers of the pearling industry and\r\nmarketing are Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin; McGregor, Clinton, and\r\nMuscatine, Iowa; Newport, Black Rock, and Bald Knob, Arkansas; Clinton,\r\nCarthage, and Smithville, Tennessee; St. Francisville, Illinois; and\r\nVincennes and Leavenworth, Indiana.\r\n\r\nHowever, a large number of the pearls from American rivers are consigned\r\nby the finders to well-known gem dealers, the owners depending for fair\r\ntreatment on the integrity and high standing of these experts. An\r\ninteresting story is told of the pearl and the accompanying shell in\r\nwhich it was found, which was sent to a New York dealer by a poor woman.\r\nThe price she received pleased her immensely; and in writing her\r\nappreciation, she added that she was especially gratified at receiving\r\nso good a price because it enabled her to send her boy to school. The\r\ndealer sent another check as a gift, and a few days before the next\r\nThanksgiving Day a thirty-five-pound turkey was received by the\r\nfour-score-year-old jeweler as an evidence of the mother’s gratitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NECKLACE OF FRESH-WATER PEARLS\r\n\r\n  Paris Exposition, 1900\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe outbreak of pearl hunting in various parts of the country is\r\nfrequently chronicled by the newspapers. These despatches are much\r\nalike, usually telling how some fisherman discovered a beautiful pearl\r\nwhich he sold to some responsible jeweler for an amount varying from\r\n$100 to $2000. The despatches generally state further that the effect of\r\nthe find has been remarkable; the whole region is seized with the fever,\r\nand into the rivers and creeks swarm the hunters of both sexes, of all\r\nages, and from all classes of the community. Factory-men leave their\r\nmills, farmers their crops, and merchants their stores, and with the\r\nmembers of their families join in searching for the gems. The mussels\r\nare secured by whatever means is most convenient. If valuable finds\r\ncontinue, thousands and thousands of mollusks are destroyed in the\r\nsearch, and when the efforts begin to prove futile the excitement\r\nsubsides almost as quickly as it began. In very many localities the\r\nindustry has run the whole gamut of the feverish excitement of its\r\nbeginning, the humor and romance of its existence, and the pathos of its\r\nending.\r\n\r\nIf disturbed labor conditions at the height of the excitement were the\r\nonly disagreeable attendant, these pearling furors could be viewed more\r\nfavorably. But, unfortunately, in many localities, especially in shoal\r\nwaters of restricted area, the fishery has been prosecuted so vigorously\r\nthat it appears probable the resources will be very materially\r\nimpoverished if not ruined in a few years, unless prompt and decisive\r\nprotective measures are adopted. In some waters the crowds engaged in\r\nthe search have removed practically every mussel without regard not only\r\nto protecting the immature mussels, but even to the necessity for\r\npreserving breeding mollusks. Many ponds and small river basins have\r\nbeen so denuded that not for many years, if ever, can they recover their\r\nformer wealth of pearl-bearers.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs has not come about without opposition on the part\r\nof those interested in the industry and the general welfare of the\r\nlocalities. Intelligent and well-directed efforts have been made to\r\nprovide a system of regulations for protecting the mussels so that the\r\nmaximum yield of pearls may be secured. But this is a very difficult\r\nproblem to deal with. It involves not only the methods of fishery, but\r\nthe question of sewage disposal by the cities and the large factories,\r\nthrough which great quantities of mussels have been destroyed.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly it will be difficult to devise regulations that will be\r\nsatisfactory alike to the fishermen, the button manufacturers and the\r\nfarmers. The great desideratum in the pearl fisheries—of the seas as\r\nwell as in the fresh-water streams—is a restriction of the gathering to\r\nsuch mollusks and to such seasons and periods of years as produce the\r\nlargest results with the least injury to the permanency of the\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nIt is generally agreed that the young or immature mollusks should be\r\nprotected; but it is not easy to determine what is an immature Unio, as\r\nsome species never grow large. Likewise, the beds should not be\r\ndisturbed when the mollusks are loaded with young, but it is difficult\r\nto select particular months which would be better for close season than\r\nany others. The propositions which seem to be most actively advocated\r\nimpose restrictions on the number and size of the mussels to be taken, a\r\ncessation of fishing from January 1 to May 31, closing certain areas\r\nwhen partly depleted, and prohibiting the use of especially injurious\r\nforms of apparatus. But whatever is done should be done without delay,\r\nbefore the pearl hunters and the button manufacturers kill the goose\r\nwhich for some years has been laying the golden eggs.[323]\r\n\r\n\r\n                MISCELLANEOUS PEARL FISHERIES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n        The deep’s wealth, coral, and pearl, and sand\r\n          Like spangling gold, and purple shells engraven\r\n        With mystic legends by no mortal hand.\r\n\r\n                                SHELLEY, _The Revolt of Islam_.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful pearls of the conch (_Strombus gigas_) are sought for in\r\nthe West Indies and on the neighboring continental coasts. They are\r\nfound most abundantly about the Bahamas, a group of more than four\r\nhundred islands off the Florida coast, where many of the fishermen\r\ndevote a considerable portion of their time to collecting them. It is\r\nfrom this industry that the beach-combers of this group of islands, as\r\nwell as those of the Florida reefs, have received the designation\r\n“Conchs.”\r\n\r\nNear the shores, where they formerly abounded, a few conchs are yet\r\npicked up by wading fishermen. In waters of medium depth they are\r\nsecured either by diving or by means of a long pole with a hook at the\r\nend. In great depths, the mollusks are located by means of a waterglass\r\nsimilar to the type employed in the Red Sea or among the South Sea\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nThe animal is readily removed from the shell after crushing the tip end\r\nof the spire where the large muscle is attached. The flesh forms an\r\nimportant article of food to the fishermen and to the residents of the\r\noutlying islands. It is said that a “Conch” can make a visit to Nassau\r\nof a week or ten days, and subsist almost entirely on this dried meat,\r\nwith which he fills his pockets on starting. A large demand exists for\r\nthe beautiful shells for ornamenting flower-beds, garden-walks, etc.\r\nMany of them are burned into lime for building purposes. Formerly\r\nseveral hundred thousand shells were exported annually to England for\r\nuse in porcelain manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe pearls are generally found embedded in the flesh of the mollusk;\r\nquite often they are in a sac or cyst with an external opening, from\r\nwhich they are sometimes dislodged by the muscular movement of the\r\nanimal. The yield is small, a thousand shells in many cases yielding\r\nonly a very small number of seed-pearls or perhaps none at all. Most of\r\nthem are oval, commonly somewhat elongated. The usual size is about one\r\ngrain in weight, but some of them weigh over twenty, and a very few\r\nexceed fifty grains each. These pearls are generally of a deep pink\r\ncolor, shading toward whitish pink at each end. While this is the usual\r\ncolor, yellow, white, red, and even brown conch pearls are occasionally\r\nobtained; these are not so highly prized as the pink ones. Conch pearls\r\npresent a peculiar wavy appearance and a sheen somewhat like watered\r\nsilk, a result of the reflections produced by the fibrous stellated\r\nstructure. While many are beautifully lustrous, they are commonly\r\ndeficient in orient, and the color is somewhat evanescent.\r\n\r\nMost of the Bahama conch fishermen sell their catch of pearls at Nassau.\r\nAccording to the late Mr. Frederick E. Stearns, there are in Nassau four\r\ndealers who have an arrangement with Paris and London houses, to whom\r\nthey can ship pearls in any number and draw against them with a bill of\r\nlading. In addition to these, there are a dozen dealers in Nassau who\r\nbuy what pearls they can secure and offer them for sale.\r\n\r\nThe value of conch pearls is as variable as their form, color, and size,\r\nand they are sold by the fishermen at prices ranging from twenty-five\r\ncents to one dollar or more each. Those weighing from three to ten\r\ngrains, and of good color and luster, but not quite regular in form,\r\nsell for about $10 per grain; those of exceptional perfection in color\r\nand form, and of about the same weights, sell for from $15 to $30 per\r\ngrain. In other and exceptional cases, where the size is very large, the\r\nform perfect, and the color and luster choice, the value is enhanced to\r\nseveral hundred and even several thousand dollars each. A perfect conch\r\npearl is among the most rare and most valuable of gems. An unusually\r\nchoice one has sold in New York City for more than $5000. The yield\r\nfluctuates considerably, but perhaps averages about $85,000 in value\r\nannually. One of the finest conch pearls ever found is shown on the\r\nplate with the conch shell.\r\n\r\nThere are two important materials that have occasionally been sold and\r\nmistaken for the conch pearl. First, the pale Italian, Japanese, or West\r\nIndian coral, with a color very closely approaching that of the pearl.\r\nBy means of a lens it can readily be seen that the coral is in layers,\r\nand does not possess the concentric structure of the pearl, or the\r\npeculiar interwoven structure, with its characteristic sheen, so\r\nfrequent in conch pearls. Secondly, the pink conch shell in which the\r\npearl itself is found; this is frequently cut to imitate the pearl and\r\nsold as such in the West Indies and elsewhere. This can also be detected\r\nby the fact that the layers are almost horizontal and the structure is\r\nnot concentric or interwoven, as it is in the conch pearl, while the\r\nluster is more like that of the shell than that of the pearly nacre.\r\n\r\nStreeter relates that many years ago an ingenious American turned out\r\nsome bits of conch shell into the shape of pearls and placed them in the\r\nconch shells. A slight secretion formed over them, but it was not the\r\ntrue pearly secretion, and the layer was very thin, so that the\r\ndeception was easily detected.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting of the American pearl fisheries is that which\r\nhas the abalones (Haliotis) for its object. These occur in many inshore\r\ntropical and semi-tropical waters, and particularly in the marginal\r\nwaters of the Pacific. They attach themselves to the rocks by means of\r\ntheir large muscular disk-shaped foot, which acts like a sucker or an\r\nexhaust-cup.\r\n\r\nOn the California coast the abalones are gathered in large quantities\r\nfor the pearls, for the shells, and especially for the flesh, which is\r\ndried and used for food. The principal fishing grounds are at Point\r\nLobos in Monterey County, and along the shores of Catalina and Santa\r\nRosa islands in Santa Barbara County, with smaller quantities from\r\nHalfmoon Bay and from the rocks along the shores of Mendocino County. At\r\nlow tide the fishermen wade out in shallow water, and, by means of a\r\nknife, separate the mollusk from its resting-place. Unless this is done\r\nquickly and before the mollusk has time to prepare itself for the\r\nattack, it closes down on the rock by means of its sucker-like foot,\r\nfrom which it cannot be removed without breaking the shell. A story is\r\ntold at Santa Barbara of a Chinese fisherman having been drowned off one\r\nof the outer islands by having his hand caught underneath the shell of\r\nan abalone.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, Japanese fishermen introduced the use of diving-suits\r\nin taking these mollusks in three fathoms of water; but in March, 1907,\r\nthe California legislature interdicted this form of fishery. That\r\nlegislature also interdicted the capture of black abalones measuring\r\n“less than twelve inches around the outer edge of the shell, or any\r\nother abalone, the shell of which shall measure less than fifteen inches\r\naround the outer edge.”\r\n\r\nThe animal is removed from the shell by thrusting a thin blade of soft\r\nsteel between the flesh and the shell, and thus loosening the great\r\nmuscle. The flesh is salted and boiled, and then strung on long rods to\r\ndry in the open air. When properly cured, the pieces are almost as hard\r\nand stiff as sole leather. Most of it is packed in sacks and exported to\r\nChina, but large quantities are sold on the Pacific coast at from five\r\nto ten cents per pound. The catch is much less than it was forty years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SHELL OF PEARL-BEARING ABALONE\r\n\r\n  From the coast of California\r\n]\r\n\r\nMany pearly masses are obtained from the abalones, and a few of these\r\nare of considerable beauty. Some are very large, measuring two inches in\r\nlength and half an inch or more in width; but they are rarely of good\r\nform, and their value is commonly far less than that of choice Oriental\r\npearls. Owing to their irregularity in form, they are scarcely suitable\r\nfor necklaces. One of the best necklaces of these pearls ever brought\r\ntogether sold a few years ago for $2000; but individual specimens have\r\nexceeded $1000 in market value. While abalone pearls are not on the\r\nmarket in any great quantities, one resident of Santa Barbara has a\r\ncollection of more than a thousand specimens, ranging in value from\r\nseveral hundred dollars to less than one dollar each. Most of the\r\nobjects sold in curio and jewelry stores on the Pacific coast as abalone\r\npearls are simply irregular knots or protuberances cut from the surface\r\nof the shell. The California fishermen are credited with having received\r\n$3000 for the abalone pearls in 1904; but it is safe to say that this\r\nrepresents only a small fraction of their final sale value.\r\n\r\nIn the river mussels of Canada, and especially in those from the\r\nProvince of Quebec, and the Ungava Region, pearls are occasionally\r\nfound. These are usually white and of good luster. They are not the\r\nobject of systematic search, but in the aggregate many are secured by\r\nIndians and Eskimos, and some by the trappers and fishermen who operate\r\nfrom Quebec and Montreal. A number, weighing from one to sixty-five\r\ngrains each, were shown at the Colonial Exhibition in London in 1886,\r\nand received favorable notice. Recently, two beautifully matched pink\r\npearls, weighing about fourteen grains each, were obtained from one\r\nmussel. A single pearl found in Canada has sold for $1000, but as a\r\ngeneral rule they are of relatively little value. The Hudson Bay traders\r\nare represented as having secured a fair share of these pearls.\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years, many pearls have been found in the streams of\r\nPrince Edward Island and of New Brunswick Province, and also in those of\r\nNova Scotia. Most of them are well formed, but their color is generally\r\ninferior and their luster deficient. Many of them are buff or brown in\r\ncolor, some are bright and fairly good, a few are rose-tinted, and\r\nothers are slate-colored and even almost black. Toronto jewelers report\r\nthat many Canadian pearls are in the possession of farmers and others in\r\nthe lower provinces, held by them for higher prices than the jewelers\r\nare willing to pay. The Nova Scotia pearls are from a bivalve which has\r\nbeen identified as _Alasmodon margaritifera_. They are especially\r\nabundant in Annapolis and King counties.\r\n\r\nEven in the streams of northern Labrador and of the Caniapuscaw\r\nwatershed, pearls are obtained by the natives, and by the hunters and\r\nfishermen who resort to that desolate country. These closely resemble\r\nthe pearls of Scotland in color, size, and luster. A story is told of a\r\nfisherman who by chance found in one shell two well-matched pearls,\r\nwhich he later sold for $150; so pleased was he with his success that he\r\nspent a fortnight in diligent search, but secured only half a dozen\r\nsmall ones, worth perhaps $3 for the lot. Most of these pearls are\r\nsilvery white, but beautiful pink ones are not rare. An unusually choice\r\n20–grain pearl from this region sold in 1905 for $1000.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Ecuador, pearl fisheries of minor importance have been\r\nprosecuted from time to time. Dr. H. M. Saville, of the American Museum\r\nof Natural History, states that in his explorations in that country he\r\nfrequently came across evidence of pearls and the information that\r\nfisheries had existed on the coast centuries ago.\r\n\r\nAn interesting letter from that world-wide traveler and interesting\r\nwriter, William E. Curtis, states that formerly there was a pearl\r\nfishery on the coast of Ecuador at the little town known as Manta, in\r\nthe Province of Manabi; but it had to be abandoned on account of a\r\nparticularly voracious species of fish called _el manti_, which abounds\r\nin that locality and gives the place its name. Pearls are said to be\r\neven more abundant at Manta than in Panama Bay. It is reported that this\r\nis the place where the Incas obtained those splendid gems which the\r\nSpaniards found in the palaces and temples of Peru.\r\n\r\nIn the waters of Costa Rica, pearl-oysters are found, and at times the\r\nfishery has been of considerable local importance. Owing to fear of\r\ninjury to the reefs, the use of diving machinery was interdicted there a\r\nfew years ago; but in 1906 its employment was authorized under certain\r\nrestrictions. Licenses good for six months were authorized for a maximum\r\nof thirty machines, which may work at a minimum depth of thirty-seven\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Colombia, South America, scattered reefs of\r\npearl-oysters occur. A lease of the pearl fisheries and those for corals\r\nand sponges was granted July 2, 1906, but it is unknown what results\r\nhave followed. This lease lasts five years, beginning August 1, 1906.\r\n\r\nThere is almost an absolute paucity of information in regard to the\r\noccurrence of fresh-water pearls in other parts of South America. The\r\nonly data we have obtained are from Prof. Eugene Hussak of the Mining\r\nSchool of Sao Paulo, Brazil, who writes us that some pearls have been\r\nobtained from one of the Bahia rivers. Possibly, when the resources of\r\nthe interior of that continent are better known, many pearls may be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XI\r\n\r\n                    PEARL-CULTURE AND PEARL-FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XI\r\n                    PEARL-CULTURE AND PEARL-FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n         Some asked how pearls did grow, and where.\r\n           Then spoke I to my girl,\r\n         To part her lips, and show them there\r\n           The quarelets of pearl.\r\n\r\n                             HERRICK, _The Quarrie of Pearls_.\r\n\r\nThe great profit that would accrue from an increased output of pearls\r\nhas long directed attention to the problem of bringing this about by\r\nartificial means.\r\n\r\nIn his life of Apollonius of Tyana, Philostratus, a Greek writer of the\r\nthird century, repeats a story afloat at the time, which credited the\r\nArabs of the Red Sea with possessing some method of growing pearls\r\nartificially. The story as it reached Greece was that they first poured\r\noil upon the sea for the purpose of calming the waves, and then dived\r\ndown and caused the oysters to open their shells. Having effected this,\r\nthey pricked the flesh with a sharp instrument and received the liquor\r\nwhich flowed from the wounds into suitable molds, and this liquor there\r\nhardened into the shape, color, and consistence of the natural\r\ngems.[324]\r\n\r\nWhile the description given by Philostratus is charged with many\r\nimprobable details, and could scarcely develop belief, even in the most\r\ncredulous, as to the exact method of procedure, it seems that the story\r\nmay not have been wholly without foundation, and that attempts were made\r\nat that remote date to stimulate the growth of pearls.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times, the possibility of aiding or starting pearly\r\nformations in mollusks seems first to have been conceived by the Chinese\r\nabout the fourteenth century. In 1736 there appeared in that storehouse\r\nof Oriental information, “Lettres édifiantes et curieuses écrites des\r\nmissions étrangères,”[325] a communication from F. X. de Entrecolles,\r\ndated Pekin, 4th November, 1734, which set forth that there were people\r\nin China who busied themselves with growing pearls, and the product was\r\nnot only vastly superior to the imitations manufactured in Europe, but\r\nwere scarcely to be distinguished from the genuine. From Father\r\nEntrecolles’s very detailed quotation of his unnamed Chinese authority,\r\nwe condense this account. In a basin one half full of fresh water, place\r\nthe largest mussels obtainable, set this basin in a secluded place where\r\nthe dew may fall thereon, but where no female approaches, and neither\r\nthe barking of dogs nor the crowing of chickens is to be heard.\r\nPulverize some seed-pearls (_Yo tchu_), such as are commonly used in\r\nmedicine, moisten this powder with juice expressed from leaves of a\r\nspecies of holly (_Che ta-kong lao_), and then roll the moistened powder\r\ninto perfectly round pellets the size of a pea. These are permitted to\r\ndry under a moderate sunlight, and then are carefully inserted within\r\nthe open shells of the mollusks. Each day for one hundred days the\r\nmussels are nourished with equal parts of powdered ginseng, china root,\r\n_peki_, which is a root more glutinous than isinglass, and of _pecho_,\r\nanother medicinal root, all combined with honey and molded in the form\r\nof rice grains.\r\n\r\nAlthough extremely detailed in some particulars, the Chinese account\r\nomits much to be desired as to the method in which the shells were\r\nopened to receive the pellets and the nourishment, and as to the\r\nimportance of seclusion from females and loud noises. Admitting that it\r\nis “inaccurate and misleading,” this letter seems to indicate very\r\nclearly that the Chinese had some method of assisting nature in growing\r\npearls in river mussels.\r\n\r\nThe first person in Europe whose suggestion of the possibility of\r\npearl-culture attracted general attention was Linnæus, the Swedish\r\nnaturalist (1707–1778). In a letter to Von Haller, the Swiss anatomist,\r\ndated 13th September, 1748, he wrote: “At length I have ascertained the\r\nmanner in which pearls originate and grow in shells; and in the course\r\nof five or six years I am able to produce, in any mother-of-pearl shell\r\nthe size of one’s hand, a pearl as large as the seed of the common\r\nvetch.”[326] There was much secrecy about Linnæus’s discovery, and even\r\nyet there is uncertainty as to the details of the method.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Shell of _Dipsas plicatus_, with attached metal figures of Buddha\r\n    coated with nacre\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Shell of _Dipsas plicatus_, with attached porcelain beads coated with\r\n    nacre\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Linnean Society of London apparently possesses some of the very\r\npearls grown by Linnæus, as well as several manuscripts which throw much\r\nlight on this subject. It appears from the latter that, under date of\r\n6th February, 1761, Linnæus wrote that he “possessed the art” of\r\nimpregnating mussels for pearl production, and offered for a suitable\r\nreward from the state to publish the “secret” for the public use and\r\nbenefit. A select committee of the state council of Sweden was appointed\r\nto confer with him, and on 27th July, 1761, the naturalist appeared and\r\nverbally explained his discovery. After various meetings, the select\r\ncommittee approved the “art” and recommended a compensation of 12,000\r\ndalars (about $4800). It does not appear that the award was paid, and\r\nthe following year the secret was purchased by Peter Bagge, a Gothenberg\r\nmerchant, for the sum of 6000 dalars. On 7th September, 1762, King\r\nAdolph Frederick issued a grant to this merchant “to practice the art\r\nwithout interference or competition.”[327]\r\n\r\nPeter Bagge was unable to exercise the rights which he had acquired, nor\r\nwas he able to dispose of them to advantage. On his death the memorandum\r\nof the secret became lost, and it was not found until about 1821, when\r\nit was discovered by a grandson, J. P. Bagge. Under the date of 27th\r\nFebruary, 1822, the King of Sweden confirmed to this grandson the\r\nprivileges which his ancestor had purchased in 1762. Fruitless efforts\r\nwere again made to dispose profitably of the rights either to\r\nindividuals or to the Swedish government.\r\n\r\nThe details of Linnæus’s “secret” have never been published\r\nauthoritatively. In his “History of Inventions,” Beckmann states that\r\nbefore the naturalist thought of the profits that might accrue from his\r\ndiscovery, he intimated the process in the sixth edition of his “Systema\r\nnaturæ,” wherein he states: “Margarita testæ excrescentia latere\r\ninteriore, dum exterius latus perforatur.”[328] “I once told him,” says\r\nBeckmann, “that I had discovered his secret in his own writings; he\r\nseemed to be displeased, made no inquiry as to the passage, and changed\r\nthe discourse.”[329]\r\n\r\nIn the second volume of his edition of “Linnæus’s Correspondence,”[330]\r\nSir J. E. Smith remarks: “Specimens of pearls so produced by art in the\r\n_Mya margaritifera_ are in the Linnean cabinet. The shell appears to\r\nhave been pierced by flexible wires, the ends of which perhaps remain\r\ntherein.” Referring to this remark, J. P. Bagge comments: “This is the\r\nnearest I have seen any one come to truth, but still it will be remarked\r\nby reading the ‘secret’ that more information is required to enable\r\npersons to practice the art.”\r\n\r\nAfter a thorough examination of the manuscripts and other material,\r\nProfessor Herdman concludes that the essential points of Linnæus’s\r\nprocess are to make a very small hole in the shell and insert a round\r\npellet of limestone fixed at the end of a fine silver wire, the hole\r\nbeing near the end of the shell so as to interfere only slightly with\r\nthe mollusk, and the nucleus being kept free from the interior of the\r\nshell so that the resulting pearl may not become adherent to it by a\r\ndeposit of nacre.[331]\r\n\r\nShortly after Linnæus communicated with the Swedish government and\r\nbefore his death, it was learned in Europe that the art of producing\r\n“culture pearls” by a somewhat similar process had been practised by the\r\nChinese for centuries.[332] They used several forms of matrices or\r\nnuclei, but principally spheres of nacre and bits of flat metal or\r\nmolded lead, which were not infrequently in conventional outline of\r\nBuddha. In the spring or early summer, these were introduced under the\r\nmantle of the living mollusk after the shell had been carefully opened a\r\nfraction of an inch, and the animal was then returned to the pond, or\r\nlake. The mollusk did its work in a leisurely way, like some people who\r\nhave little to do, and many months elapsed before it was ready for\r\nopening and the removal of the pearly objects.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory description we have seen of this process appears\r\nto be that communicated nearly a century later to the London Society of\r\nArts by Dr. D. T. Macgowan,[333] through H. B. M. plenipotentiary in\r\nChina, from which this account is abridged and modified.\r\n\r\nThe industry is prosecuted in two villages near the city of Titsin, in\r\nthe northern part of the province of Che-kiang, a silk-producing region.\r\nIn May or June large specimens of the fresh-water mussels, _Dipsas\r\nplicatus_, are brought in baskets from Lake Tai-hu, about thirty miles\r\ndistant. For recuperation from the journey, they are immersed in fresh\r\nwater for a few days in bamboo cages, and are then ready to receive the\r\nmatrices.\r\n\r\nThese nuclei are of various forms and materials, the most common being\r\nspherical beads of nacre, pellets of mud moistened with juice of camphor\r\nseeds, and especially thin leaden images, generally of Buddha in the\r\nusual sitting posture. In introducing these objects, the shell is gently\r\nopened with a spatula of bamboo or of pearl shell, and the mantle of the\r\nmollusk is carefully separated from one surface of the shell with a\r\nmetal probe. The foreign bodies are then successively introduced at the\r\npoint of a bifurcated bamboo stick, and placed, commonly in two parallel\r\nrows, upon the inner surface of the shell; a sufficient number having\r\nbeen placed on one valve, the operation is repeated on the other. As\r\nsoon as released, the animal closes its shell, thus keeping the matrices\r\nin place. The mussels are then deposited one by one in canals or\r\nstreams, or in ponds connected therewith, five or six inches apart, and\r\nwhere the depth is from two to five feet under water.\r\n\r\nIf taken up within a few days and examined, the nuclei will be found\r\nattached to the shell by a membranous secretion; later this appears to\r\nbe impregnated with calcareous matter, and finally layers of nacre are\r\ndeposited around each nucleus, the process being analagous to the\r\nformation of calculary concretions in animals of higher development. A\r\nridge generally extends from one pearly tumor to another, connecting\r\nthem all together. Each month several tubs of night soil are thrown into\r\nthe reservoir for the nourishment of the animals. Great care is taken to\r\nkeep goat excretia from the water, as it is highly detrimental to the\r\nmussels, preventing the secretion of good nacre or even killing them if\r\nthe quantity be sufficient. Persons inexperienced in the management lose\r\nten or fifteen per cent. by deaths; others lose virtually none in a\r\nwhole season.\r\n\r\nIn November, the mussels are removed from the water and opened, and the\r\npearly masses are detached by means of a knife. If the matrix be of\r\nnacre, this is not removed; but the earthen and the metallic matrices\r\nare cut away, melted resin or white sealing-wax poured into the cavity,\r\nand the orifice covered with a piece of shell. These pearly formations\r\nhave some of the luster and beauty of true pearls, and are furnished at\r\na rate so cheap as to be procurable by almost any one. Most of them are\r\npurchased by jewelers, who set them in various personal ornaments, and\r\nespecially in decorations for the hair. Those formed in the image of\r\nBuddha are used largely for amulets as well as for ornaments. They are\r\nabout half an inch long, and while in the shell have a bluish tint,\r\nwhich disappears with removal of the matrix. Quantities of them are sold\r\nas talismans to pilgrims at the Buddhist shrines about Pooto and\r\nHang-chau.\r\n\r\nIn some shells the culture pearls are permitted to remain by the Chinese\r\ngrowers, for sale as curios or souvenirs; specimens of these have found\r\ntheir way into many public and private collections of Europe and\r\nAmerica. These shells are generally about seven inches long and four or\r\nfive inches broad, and contain a double or triple row of pearls or\r\nimages, as many as twenty-five of the former and sixteen of the latter\r\nto each valve. That the animal should survive the introduction of so\r\nmany irritating bodies, and in such a brief period secrete a covering of\r\nnacre over them all, is certainly a striking physiological fact. Indeed,\r\nsome naturalists have expressed strong doubts as to its possibility,\r\nsupposing the forms were made to adhere to the shell by some\r\ncomposition; but the examination of living specimens in different stages\r\nof growth, with both valves studded with them, has fully demonstrated\r\nits truth.\r\n\r\nIt is represented that in the northern part of the Che-kiang province\r\nabout five thousand families are employed in this work in connection\r\nwith rice-growing and silk-culture. To some of them it is the chief\r\nsource of income, single families realizing as much as 300 silver\r\ndollars annually therefrom. In the village of Chung-kwan-o, the\r\nheadquarters for culture pearls in China, a temple has been erected to\r\nthe memory of the originator of this industry, Yu Shun Yang, who lived\r\nlate in the thirteenth century, and was an ancestor of many persons now\r\nemployed thereby.\r\n\r\nThe method in vogue in China for so many centuries has been the\r\nstarting-point for similar attempts in various other countries. During\r\nthe New Jersey pearling excitement in 1857, there were found several\r\nspherical pieces of nacre which had been introduced into Unios\r\napparently for experimental pearl-culture; and in the collection of\r\nshells bequeathed to the United States National Museum by the late Dr.\r\nIsaac Lea, is a hemispherical piece of candle grease partly coated with\r\npinkish nacre. Kelaart applied the Chinese method to the Ceylon\r\npearl-oysters with much success in 1858. At the Berlin Fisheries\r\nExhibition, in 1880, appeared the results of experiments in growing\r\nculture pearls in the river mussels in Saxony. Small foreign bodies had\r\nbeen introduced in the mantle, and others had been inserted between the\r\nmantle and the shell. These nuclei consisted of shell beads, unsightly\r\npearls from other mussels, etc.; but unfortunately the shape of these\r\nwas such that the mantle could not fit closely around them, consequently\r\nthe result was so irregular as to be of no value except to show that\r\nGerman Unios as well as those of China could be made to cover foreign\r\nobjects with pearly material.\r\n\r\nProfessor Herdman notes that, between 1751 and 1754, an inspector named\r\nFrederick Hedenberg received an annual salary “to inoculate the\r\npearl-mussels of Lulea (in the northern part of Sweden) with\r\n‘pearl-seeds’ which he manufactured, and then to replant the mussels.\r\nCertain pearls were produced by the inspector, which it is recorded were\r\nsold for some 300 silver dollars.”[334]\r\n\r\nAs noted by Broussonnet, in Finland artificial pearls were produced by\r\ninserting a round piece of nacre between the inner face of the shell and\r\nthe mantle. The owner of the pearl fisheries at Vilshofen has succeeded\r\nin producing pearly figures by introducing into the mollusk flat figures\r\nof pewter, most of them representing fish in form.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Bouchon-Brandely made experiments in pearl production at\r\nTahiti. Gimlet holes about half an inch in diameter were drilled through\r\ndifferent places in the shells of pearl-oysters, and through each of\r\nthese holes a pellet of nacre or of glass was inserted and held by brass\r\nwire passing through a stopper of cork or burao wood, by means of which\r\neach opening was hermetically closed, so that the pellet was the only\r\nforeign substance protruding on the inside of the shell.[335] The\r\noysters were returned to the sea without further injury, and after the\r\nlapse of a month the pellets were found covered with thin layers of\r\nnacre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Artificial rearing-ponds for the development of pearl-oysters on the\r\n    Island of Espiritū Santo, Gulf of California\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Trays containing small pearl-oysters prepared for placing at the\r\n    bottom of artificial rearing-ponds at Espiritū Santo Island, Gulf of\r\n    California\r\n]\r\n\r\nExperiments in growing pearls in the abalone or Haliotis were made in\r\n1897 by Louis Bouton, an account of which was given at the meeting of\r\nthe Paris Académie des Sciences in 1898.[336] The tenacity of life in\r\nthis mollusk makes it especially desirable for experiments of this\r\nnature. Through small holes bored into the shell, pellets of\r\nmother-of-pearl were inserted and placed within the mantle, the small\r\nholes being afterward closed up. Other nacreous pellets were introduced\r\ndirectly into the bronchial cavity. The objects were soon covered with\r\nthin, pearly layers, resulting in a few months in spheres of much\r\nbeauty, resembling somewhat the pearls naturally produced by this\r\nmollusk. In six months, according to M. Bouton, the layers became of\r\nsufficient thickness to be attractive. Within limitations, the size of\r\nthe pearl produced is in proportion to the length of time it is allowed\r\nto remain within the mollusk. The results of the experiments seem to\r\nencourage further efforts in this line, and possibly in course of time\r\nthere may be a profitable business in growing pearls in abalones on the\r\nPacific coast of the United States. Indeed, the experiments in\r\ntransplanting and cultivating the pearl-oyster in Australia leads one to\r\nfancy that the culture of that species in the warm coastal waters of\r\nAmerica is by no means an impossibility.\r\n\r\nMany other experiments along similar lines have been made more recently.\r\nAn interesting feature of attempts made by Mr. Vane Simmonds of Cedar\r\nRapids, Iowa, in 1896–1898, is that in order to avoid straining the\r\nadductor muscles by forcibly opening the shell while the mollusk\r\nresisted the intrusion, each selected Unio was exposed in the open air\r\nand sunshine until the valves opened; then a wooden wedge was carefully\r\ninserted in the opening, and the mollusk immediately immersed in water\r\nto revive it or to sustain life. After a few moments of immersion, the\r\noperator carefully raised the mantle from the shell, inserted the pellet\r\nof wax or other small article to be covered with nacre, drew the mantle\r\nto its normal position, removed the wedge, and returned the mollusk to a\r\nselected place in the stream at sufficient depth to avoid danger of\r\nfreezing in winter.\r\n\r\nProbably it would be more satisfactory to stupefy the mollusks by means\r\nof some chemical in order to insert the pellets. Marine mollusks have\r\nbeen successfully stupefied by slowly adding magnesium sulphate crystals\r\nto the sea water until the animals no longer respond to contact. If\r\ntreatment is not too prolonged, they may be returned to normal sea water\r\nwith good prospects of recovery. To stupefy fresh-water mollusks, either\r\nchloral hydrate or chlorosone may be employed, although the latter is\r\nexpensive to use in great quantity. Dr. Charles B. Davenport, of the\r\nCarnegie Institution, suggests that it might be well to experiment with\r\npouring ether or chloroform over them.\r\n\r\nIn Japan the production of these pearly formations in _Margaritifera\r\nmartensi_, which is closely related to the Ceylon oyster, has developed\r\ninto some prominence since 1890, and the results have been well\r\nadvertised. The industry is located in Ago Bay, near the celebrated\r\ntemple of Ise in the province of Shima, and gives employment to about\r\none hundred persons. It is stated that the proprietor, Kokichi Mikimoto,\r\nhas leased about one thousand acres of sea bottom, on which are a\r\nmillion oysters of this species, which yield from 30,000 to 50,000\r\nculture pearls annually.\r\n\r\nAs described by Dr. K. Mitsukuri, the shoal portions of this area are\r\nused for breeding the oysters and raising them to maturity, and in the\r\ndeeper parts—covered by several fathoms of water—the oysters are\r\nspecially treated for producing the culture pearls. In the former, the\r\nspat is collected on small stones, weighing six or eight pounds each,\r\nplaced during May or June. The following November these stones, with the\r\nattached spat or young, are removed, for protection from cold, to depths\r\ngreater than five or six feet, where they remain for about three years.\r\nAt the end of that period, the growing oysters are taken from the water,\r\nthe shells opened slightly, and rounded bits of pearl shell or nacre are\r\nintroduced under the mantle without injury to the mollusks. About\r\n300,000 are thus treated annually, and placed in the deeper water at the\r\nrate of about one to each square foot of bottom area. After the lapse of\r\nabout four years more, the oysters are removed from the water and\r\nopened, when a large percentage of the pellets are found covered on the\r\nupper or exposed surface with nacre of good luster.\r\n\r\nMost of these culture pearls are button-shaped and weigh two or three\r\ngrains each. Although somewhat attractive and superior to the culture\r\npearls of China and other fresh waters, they by no means compare\r\nfavorably with choice pearls. They are rarely, if ever, spherical, and\r\nonly the upper surface is lustrous; consequently they serve only the\r\npurpose of half-pearls. A cross section shows the nacreous growth in a\r\nthin concentric layer, forming a fragile hemispherical cap, the concave\r\nwall of which is covered with a brownish granular secretion which\r\nprevents perfect adhesion. Compared with choice pearls, they are not\r\nonly deficient in luster, but are fragile, and are beautiful only on the\r\nupper surface, and not available for necklaces. Good specimens sell for\r\nseveral dollars each, and some individuals reach $50 or more. Specimens\r\nexhibited at the Paris Exposition in 1900 were awarded a silver medal;\r\nat the St. Petersburg Exhibition in 1902 they were awarded a gold medal;\r\nat the Tokio Exhibition a grand prize, and a medal at the St. Louis\r\nExposition in 1904. The awards were given in the fisheries, and not the\r\ngem divisions.\r\n\r\nThe work of Mikimoto is not the only attempt now being made in Japan to\r\nproduce pearls. A letter from Dr. T. Nishikawa, of the Tokio Imperial\r\nUniversity, states: “It is a great pleasure for me to tell you that I am\r\nstudying pearl formation and pearl-oyster culture in the university\r\nlaboratory, and recently I have got my pearl laboratory at Fukura, on\r\nthe Island of Awaji, where I began the pearl-culture work this summer\r\n(1907). Fortunately, I found the cause of Japanese pearl formation,\r\n_i.e._, the reason why and how the pearl is produced in the tissue of an\r\noyster. I made practical application of this theory with great prospects\r\nfor producing the natural and true pearls at will.”\r\n\r\nAmong the most interesting of the pearl-culture enterprises are those of\r\nthe Compañia Criadora de Concha y Perla, under the direction of Sr.\r\nGaston J. Vives, in the Gulf of California. This company has an\r\nextensive station at San Gabriel, near La Paz, where breeding oysters\r\nare placed in prepared chests or cages for collecting the spat on trays.\r\nAfter remaining there for several weeks or months, the young mollusks\r\nare removed to prepared places (_viveros_) for further growth.\r\nExperiments are now made in depositing them between a series of parallel\r\ndams alternately touching each shore of a lagoon, thus developing a\r\ncurrent of water over the oysters for conveying food to them, and thus\r\nhastening their growth.\r\n\r\nIn efforts to increase the output of pearls, attention has been given to\r\nthe possibilities for extending the area and production of the reefs,\r\nand for stocking new areas and replenishing exhausted ones, thus\r\nbringing the pearl-bearing mollusks to maturity in greater abundance.\r\n\r\nAlthough theoretically it does not seem a very difficult undertaking to\r\ncultivate the pearl-oysters by methods somewhat similar to the\r\ncultivation of edible oysters and clams, in no part of the world has\r\nthis been successfully done on an extensive scale. While in certain\r\nminor cases, the areas of some species of pearl mollusks have been\r\nextended indirectly through man’s agency—as the range of the Red Sea\r\npearl-oyster into the Mediterranean since the Suez Canal was\r\nopened—there is no well-known instance in which new areas have been\r\nabundantly populated through direct efforts.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on the pearl fisheries of Asia are noted the hitherto\r\nunsuccessful efforts made in Ceylon and India to preserve the young and\r\nimmature oysters on the storm-swept reefs by removing them to less\r\nexposed areas. This has received close attention from the Ceylon\r\nauthorities during the last two years. Other practical measures which\r\nare recommended for that region include “cultching,” or the deposit of\r\nsuitable solid material, such as shells or broken stone, to which the\r\nyoung oysters can attach themselves; thinning out overcrowded reefs, and\r\ncleaning the beds by means of a dredge, thereby removing starfish and\r\nother injurious animals. The attempts made by individuals and\r\nassociations to extend the range of the reefs on the coast of Australia,\r\namong the Tuamotu Islands, in the Gulf of California, and some other\r\nlocalities, are noted in the appropriate chapters. But it may be stated\r\nthat in most instances lack of adequate police protection has been not\r\nthe least of the difficulties with which these experiments have had to\r\ncontend.\r\n\r\nNor has much greater success followed upon efforts to prevent the\r\nexhaustion of the reefs and productive grounds through overfishing,\r\nexcept in those instances in which the government exercises a\r\nproprietory interest and determines the season, the area to be fished,\r\nand the quantity of mollusks to be removed. The most prominent instance\r\nof this is in Ceylon, where the fishery has been restricted to such\r\nseasons and periods as appeared to insure the maximum yield of pearls.\r\nWithout restriction upon the fishery, the pearl-oyster in that populous\r\nregion would doubtless become almost extinct in a few years. Another\r\ninstance of proprietory interest on the part of the government is in\r\nsome of the German States, where pearl fishing has been regulated and\r\nrestricted for centuries. But there the sewage from cities and factories\r\nhas accomplished almost as effectively, if less rapidly, what\r\nunrestricted fishing would have done.\r\n\r\nMuch attention has been given to the subject of pearl-culture in\r\nBavaria, where the government has granted a small subsidy to encourage\r\nthis industry, and a model pearl-mussel bank has been established in one\r\nof the brooks for the rational culture of the mussels.\r\n\r\nOn the Australian coast, the only theoretical protection of consequence\r\nis the restriction on taking small or immature oysters; but, owing to\r\nthe great area over which the fisheries are prosecuted there, it has not\r\nbeen possible to enforce the regulations. At some of the Pacific islands\r\nand elsewhere, interdictions exist as to use of certain apparatus of\r\ncapture, but this is intended for the purpose of reserving the industry\r\nto dependent natives rather than for protecting the reefs. Several\r\nefforts have been made to insure adequate protection for the Unios in\r\nour American rivers, but nothing in this direction has yet been\r\naccomplished by legislative enactment, except in Illinois.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to the parasitic stage of Unios.[337]\r\nThe attachment of the newly-hatched mollusks to the gills or fins of a\r\nfish is entirely a matter of chance, and unless this takes place they\r\ndie within a few days. Under natural conditions the fish thus infected\r\nwill rarely be found carrying as many of the parasitic Unios as they can\r\nwithout serious injury. If the fish are placed in a tank or a pond\r\ncontaining large numbers of newly-hatched Unios, it is possible to bring\r\nabout the attachment of hundreds of them for every one that would be\r\nfound there by chance of nature. A fish six inches in length may thus be\r\nmade to carry several hundred parasitic Unios, and thus a thousand fish\r\nartificially infected may do the work of several hundred thousand in a\r\nstate of nature. Experiments with small numbers of fish under\r\nobservation in the laboratory indicate that their infection on a large\r\nscale is entirely possible, and the experiment by Messrs. Lefevre and\r\nCurtis now in progress at La Crosse, Wisconsin, in which over 25,000\r\nyoung fish have been infected, gives every indication that such work may\r\nbe begun even with the scanty knowledge now possessed.\r\n\r\nSince it has already been shown that the production of pearls is an\r\nabnormal condition, it does not follow that an increase in the quantity\r\nof mollusks would necessarily result in a corresponding increase in the\r\nyield of pearls. Indeed, it might even be that the artificial conditions\r\nbringing about an enhanced prosperity and abundance of the mollusks\r\nwould result in a corresponding decrease in the product of gems, the\r\nimproved surroundings impairing if not destroying the conditions to\r\nwhich the pearls owe their origin. This has resulted in directing\r\nefforts toward abnormally increasing the abundance of pearls in a\r\ndefinite number of mollusks.\r\n\r\nThe development of the parasitic theory of pearl formation has naturally\r\ninvited attention to the possibilities of increasing the yield of pearls\r\nby inoculating healthy mollusks with distomid parasites. It does not\r\nappear that this has yet advanced beyond the experimental stage, and\r\nvirtually all that has been accomplished has been set forth in the\r\nchapter on the origin of pearls. It seems that there are great\r\npossibilities in the artificial production along these lines; and that\r\nunder skilful management it could be made a profitable industry,\r\nespecially if carried on concurrently with the systematic cultivation of\r\nmother-of-pearl shells.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is scientific basis for the belief that it may be\r\npossible in time to bring about pearl growth in this manner, the public\r\nshould not be too hasty in financing companies soliciting capital for\r\nestablishing so-called “pearl farms.” Every once in a while announcement\r\nis made in the public press of wonderful success which has been attained\r\nby some investigator, who surrounds his discovery with as much mystery\r\nas enveloped the Keeley motor, and who is as anxious to sell stock as\r\nwas the owner of that mythical invention. A prospectus of one of these\r\n“pearl syndicates,” which is now before us, claims to “increase and\r\nhasten pearl production by forcing the oyster, through doctoring the\r\nwater in which it is immersed and also by irritating the mollusk\r\nitself.” So far as the writers are aware, aside from the inexpensive but\r\nsomewhat attractive culture pearls, no commercial success has yet\r\nfollowed the many attempts at artificial production.\r\n\r\nThis chapter should not close without reference to the so-called\r\n“breeding pearls,” probably the most curious of all theories of pearl\r\ngrowth, regarding which many inquiries have been made. Throughout the\r\nMalay Archipelago there exists a generally accepted belief that if\r\nseveral selected pearls of good size are sealed in a box with a few\r\ngrains of rice for nourishment they will increase in number as well as\r\nin size. If examined at the expiration of one year, small pearls may be\r\nfound strewn about the bottom of the box, according to the theory; and\r\nin some instances the original pearls themselves will be found to have\r\nincreased in size. If again inclosed for a further period of a year or\r\nmore, the adherents of the theory say, the seed-pearls will further\r\nincrease in size, and additional seed-pearls will form. Furthermore, the\r\ngrains of rice will present the appearance of having been nibbled or as\r\nthough a rodent had taken a bite in the end of each.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that the breeding pearls are obtained from several species\r\nof mollusks, mostly from the Margaritifera, but also from the Tridacna\r\n(giant clam) and the Placuna (window shell). While cotton is the usual\r\nmedium in which the pearls and rice are retained, some collectors\r\nsubstitute fresh water and yet others prefer salt water. It seems that\r\nrice is considered essential to success.\r\n\r\nThe earliest account we have seen of this extraordinary belief was given\r\nby Dr. Engelbert Kæmpfer,[338] who was connected with the Dutch embassy\r\nto Japan from 1690 to 1696, and since that time it has been referred to\r\nby many travelers in the Malay Archipelago.\r\n\r\nA correspondent in the time-honored “Notes and Queries,” 20th September,\r\n1862, writes:\r\n\r\n  Nearly five years ago, while staying with friends in Pulo Penang\r\n  (Straits of Malacca), I was shown by the wife of a prominent\r\n  merchant five small pearls, which had increased and multiplied in\r\n  her possession. She had set them aside for about 12 months in a\r\n  small wooden box, packed in soft cotton and with half a dozen grains\r\n  of common rice. On opening the box at the expiration of that time,\r\n  she found four additional pearls, about the size of a small pinhead\r\n  and of much beauty, which I saw and examined not long after the lady\r\n  made the discovery. While my story may be received with laughter, I\r\n  can most solemnly assure you of the truth of my having seen these\r\n  pearls, and I have not the slightest doubt of the perfect\r\n  truthfulness of the lady who possessed them. I questioned an eminent\r\n  Malay merchant of Penang on this subject, and he assured me that one\r\n  of his daughters had once possessed a similar growth of pearls.[339]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the apparent absurdity of this pearl-breeding theory,\r\nbelief in it appears to be not only sincere but wide-spread, as can be\r\nattested by any one familiar with affairs in the archipelago. A critical\r\nexamination into the matter was made in 1877 by Dr. N. B. Dennys,\r\ncurator of the Raffles Museum at Singapore, the result of which was\r\ncommunicated to the Straits branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 28th\r\nFebruary, 1878.[340] From his numerous quotations of persons who gave\r\nthe results of their experiences we extract two instances. One gentleman\r\nhad 120 small pearls in addition to the five breeding ones with which\r\nthe experiment had started twenty years before, and during the entire\r\nperiod the box had not been molested except that it was opened\r\noccasionally for inspection by interested persons. Another experimentor\r\ninclosed three breeding pearls with a few grains of rice on 17th July,\r\n1874; on opening the box on 14th July, 1875, nine additional pearls were\r\ndiscovered, and the three original ones appeared larger.\r\n\r\nThe belief has many curious variations. It is stated that in Borneo and\r\nthe adjacent islands, many of the fishermen reserve every ninth pearl\r\nregardless of its size, and put the collection in a small bottle which\r\nis kept corked with a dead man’s finger. According to Professor\r\nKimmerly, nearly every burial-place along the Borneo coast has been\r\ndesecrated in searching for “corks” for these bottles, and almost every\r\nhut has its dead-finger bottle, with from ten to fifty “breeding pearls”\r\nand twice that number of rice grains.[341] A correspondent at Sandakan,\r\nNorth Borneo, writes that at the time of his death at Hongkong in 1901,\r\nDr. Dennys had in his possession a small box containing “breeding\r\npearls”; but these disappeared after his death, and his brother, the\r\ncrown solicitor, was unable to find them. This correspondent also states\r\nthat the Ranee of Sarawak, a British protectorate in western Borneo, has\r\na collection of “breeding pearls” numbering about two hundred, and that\r\nthis is the only large collection known at present.\r\n\r\nAs contrasted with abundant and unquestionably sincere testimony that\r\npearls do “breed,” it may be stated that absolutely no result has\r\nfollowed one or two native experiments made under supervision. While it\r\nmust be admitted that negative evidence is always weaker than positive,\r\nand twenty failures would be outweighed by one successful experiment,\r\nyet the scientific objections to the possibility of pearls “breeding”\r\ncannot be overcome. The phenomenon is doubtless one of those curiosities\r\nof natural history in which some important factor has been overlooked.\r\n\r\nAnother curious theory is that peculiar pearls continue to grow after\r\nremoval from the mollusk in which they originate. Quite recently it was\r\nreported from New Durham, North Carolina, that a pearl found there in\r\n1896 had been growing continually since it was found and removed from\r\nthe water. Unfortunately, it was weighed only when the last observation\r\nwas made, and its increased size doubtless existed only in the\r\nimagination of its possessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII\r\n\r\n              MYSTICAL AND MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XII\r\n              MYSTICAL AND MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Divers are the virtues of gems; some give favor in the sight of\r\n  lords; some protect against fire; others make people beloved; others\r\n  give wisdom; some render men invisible; others repel lightning; some\r\n  baffle poisons; some protect and augment treasures, and others cause\r\n  that husbands should love their wives.\r\n\r\n                                 Arabic version of Solomon’s writings.\r\n\r\nWhile no special gems are mentioned in the tribute which the Arabs\r\ncredit to Solomon, it seems that pearls must certainly have been\r\nincluded, for in nearly all countries where these gems have been prized\r\nand from the earliest period, they have been credited with mystic\r\nproperties and healing virtues.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter of this book, reference was made to the\r\nAtharvaveda, dating from at least 2400 years ago, and its allusion to\r\nthe use of an amulet of pearl shell and of pearls among the Hindus in\r\nbestowing long life and prosperity upon young Brahmanical disciples. As\r\nthis amulet is fastened upon the youth, the following hymn is recited,\r\naccording to this ancient Veda of the Atharvans:\r\n\r\n  Born of the wind, the atmosphere, the lightning, and the light, may\r\n  this pearl shell, born of gold, protect us from straits!\r\n\r\n  With the shell which was born in the sea, at the head of bright\r\n  substances, we slay the Rakshas and conquer the Atrins [devouring\r\n  demons].\r\n\r\n  With the shell [we conquer] disease and poverty; with the shell,\r\n  too, the Sadanvas. The shell is our universal remedy; the pearl\r\n  shall protect us from straits!\r\n\r\n  Born in the heavens, born in the sea, brought on from the river\r\n  [Sindhu], this shell, born of gold, is our life-prolonging amulet.\r\n\r\n  The amulet, born from the sea, a sun, born from Vritra [the cloud],\r\n  shall on all sides protect us from the missiles of the gods and the\r\n  Asuras!\r\n\r\n  Thou art one of the golden substances, thou art born from Soma [the\r\n  moon]. Thou art sightly on the chariot, thou art brilliant on the\r\n  quiver.\r\n\r\n  (May it prolong our lives!) The bone of the gods turned into pearl;\r\n  that, animated, dwells in the waters. That do I fasten upon thee\r\n  unto life, luster, strength, longevity, unto a life lasting a\r\n  hundred autumns. May the amulet of pearl protect thee![342]\r\n\r\nThe mystical Taoists, in their pursuit of immortality, made much of\r\npearls as an important ingredient in formulæ for perpetuating youth.\r\nAccording to an old Taoist authority, in preparing one of these elixirs,\r\nan extra long pearl which has been worn for many years is steeped in\r\nsome infusion of malt, or a preparation of serpents’ gall, honeycomb,\r\nand pumice-stone. When the pearl becomes plastic, it is drawn out to the\r\nlength of two or three feet, cut into suitable lengths, and formed into\r\npills, the taking of which renders food thenceforth unnecessary.[343]\r\n\r\nThe myth of the dragon and the pearl has been a far-reaching theme of\r\nthe artists in Japan and China, whether in color, metal, or stone. There\r\nhas been much written as to how the myth became so fixed in the minds of\r\nthe Orientals, and Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, who has made an\r\nexhaustive study of the myth of the dragon in all its phases, has very\r\ncourteously communicated to us the following facts. Personally he had\r\nnever been able to learn of a true or clear description of the origin of\r\nthe myth other than the well-recorded legend given by Legge in the\r\n“Sacred Books of the East” (Vol. XL, p. 211), in which there is a\r\nquotation from Shuangtze, a writer of the fourth century before Christ,\r\nwho says: “Near the Ho river there was a poor man, who supported his\r\nfamily by weaving rushes. His son, when diving in a deep pool, found a\r\npearl worth a thousand ounces of silver. The father said: ‘Bring a stone\r\nand beat it in pieces. A pearl of this value must have been in a pool\r\nnine khung deep and under the chin of the black dragon. That you were\r\nable to get it must have been owing to your having found him asleep. Let\r\nhim awake, and the consequences will not be small.’” Prince Rupprecht\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  This legend has nothing to do with the illustration to which you\r\n  refer; it belongs to a cycle of myths concerning a stone in the head\r\n  of a serpent, or the crown of the king of the serpents or dragons;\r\n  myths which also exist in Germany since the days of old. I should\r\n  rather be inclined to think that the commonly accepted pearl between\r\n  the two dragons is not a pearl at all. At least this pearl is always\r\n  surrounded by ornaments in the shape of flames or claws, and\r\n  Professor Hirth discovered on such a representation in woodcut, an\r\n  explanation of the flames by the sign for Yangsui, a very ancient\r\n  kind of metallic mirrors, of concave form, that were used to produce\r\n  the heavenly fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAPANESE LEGEND OF THE DRAGON AND THE PEARL, IDEALIZED IN JADE\r\n\r\n  Heber R. Bishop Collection, Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n]\r\n\r\n  This explanation is probably erroneous and due to a misunderstanding\r\n  of the signs for flames. In my opinion, another explanation, that\r\n  the pearl is not really a pearl but a spider, is nearer to the\r\n  truth. As an argument in favor of this theory the following sentence\r\n  may be quoted from an encyclopedia of the eleventh century\r\n  (“Pieu-tzi-lei,” chap. 223): “The pearl of a fish is its eye, the\r\n  pearl of a tortoise is its foot, the pearl of the spider is its\r\n  belly.” Pearl, as well as spider, are both called in Chinese by the\r\n  same word but are written in a different way.\r\n\r\n  I, for my part, believe that the pearl is the belly not indeed of a\r\n  spider, but of Garuda, the eagle of Vishnu, known in the old Hindu\r\n  mythology as the foe of the Vagas, beings with human bodies and the\r\n  tails of serpents. At least, I found on an old Chinese gateway,\r\n  dating back to the times of the Mongol emperors, a sculpture showing\r\n  the contest between Garuda and the Vagas. On another sculpture of\r\n  the late King epoch the Vagas are already changed into dragons, and\r\n  the wings, the limbs and the head of Garuda have become quite\r\n  insignificant, while his belly is prominent like a ball.\r\n\r\nA beautiful metaphor occurs in ancient Chinese writings, in the Book of\r\nthe Later Han,[344] for instance, which regards this gem as the hidden\r\nsoul of the oyster.\r\n\r\nThere is no end of legends and myths regarding the pearl in oriental\r\nliterature. One fable credits it with a peculiar magical power: by\r\nspeaking the right word, a spirit can be called therefrom which makes\r\nthe owner a possessor of all the happiness of the earth. Browning notes\r\nthis in two exquisite stanzas, “A Pearl, a Girl,” published on the day\r\nof his death in 1889, in which he compares this characteristic with a\r\nwoman’s love called forth by the mystic word.\r\n\r\n             A simple ring with a single stone.\r\n               To the vulgar eye no stone of price;\r\n             Whisper the right word, that alone—\r\n               Forth starts a sprite, like fire from ice,\r\n             And lo, you are lord (says an Eastern scroll)\r\n             Of heaven and earth, lord whole and sole,\r\n                 Through the power in a pearl.\r\n\r\n             A woman (’tis I this time that say)\r\n               With little the world counts worthy praise;\r\n             Utter the true word—out and away\r\n               Escapes her soul: I am wrapt in blaze,\r\n             Creation’s lord, of heaven and earth,\r\n             Lord whole and sole—by a minute’s birth—\r\n                 Through the love in a girl.\r\n\r\nIn the folk-song of Servia is a pretty little poem which testifies to\r\nthe love they bear to pearls:\r\n\r\n             A youth unmated prays to God,\r\n             To turn him to pearls in the sea,\r\n             Where the maidens come to fill their urns;\r\n             That so they might gather him into their laps,\r\n             And string him on a fine green thread,\r\n             And wear him pendant from the neck;\r\n             That he might hear what each one said,\r\n             And whether his loved one spoke of him.\r\n\r\n             His prayer was granted and he lay\r\n             Turned to pearls in the dark blue sea,\r\n             Where the maidens come to fill their urns;\r\n             Then quickly they gather him into their laps,\r\n             And string him on a green silk thread,\r\n             And wear him pendant from the neck;\r\n             So he hears what each one says of her own\r\n             And what his loved one says of him.[345]\r\n\r\nIn the days when romance and chivalry held sway in Europe, pearls and\r\nother favors were presented by ladies for the brave knights to wear at\r\ntournaments. And we are told in the Arthurian legends how Elaine, “the\r\nlily maid of Astolat,” gave to Sir Lancelot “a red sleeve of scarlet,\r\nembroidered with great pearls,” for him to wear on his helmet: and “then\r\nto her tower she climbed and took the shield, there kept it and so lived\r\nin fantasy”; while he fought and won at the tilt, “wearing her scarlet\r\nsleeve, tho’ carved and cut, and half the pearls away.”[346]\r\n\r\nThe sweet sentiment of purity associated with the pearl ennobles it\r\nabove all other gems. Rabanus Maurus, archbishop of Mainz, wrote, about\r\n850, that “mystically, the pearl signifies the hope of the Kingdom of\r\nHeaven, or charity and the sweetness of celestial life.”[347] True, it\r\nwas not among the twelve gems which adorned the breastplate of the high\r\npriest of the Temple, symbolical of the twelve apostles. A Father of the\r\nChurch—St. Augustine, we believe—explains this by saying that it was\r\nreserved for a more sacred office, that of representing Christ himself.\r\n\r\nPearl signifies purity, innocence, humility, and a retiring spirit. All\r\nstones of the gray color of the pearl have the significances which are\r\ngiven to this beautiful gem.[348]\r\n\r\nUnlike other gems, the pearl comes to us perfect and beautiful, direct\r\nfrom the hand of nature. Other precious stones receive careful treatment\r\nfrom the lapidary, and owe much to his art. The pearl, however, owes\r\nnothing to man. Perhaps this has much to do with the sentiments we\r\ncherish for it. It touches us with the same sense of simplicity and\r\nsweetness as the mountain daisy or the wild rose. It is absolutely a\r\ngift of nature, on which man cannot improve. We turn from the brilliant,\r\ndazzling ornament of diamonds or emeralds to a necklace of pearls with a\r\nsense of relief, and the eye rests upon it with quiet, satisfied repose\r\nand is delighted with its modest splendor, its soft gleam, borrowed from\r\nits home in the depths of the sea. It seems truly to typify steady and\r\nabiding affection, which needs no accessory or adornment to make it more\r\nattractive. And there is a purity and sweetness about it which makes it\r\nespecially suitable for the maiden.\r\n\r\nThe idea of pearly purity is inseparably linked with the name Margaret,\r\nderived from the Persian _Murwari_ (pearl, or child of light) through\r\nthe Greek μαργαρίτης. This name—beautiful in sound as well as in\r\norigin—is popular in all European countries, and likewise are its\r\nabbreviations and diminutives: in Italian, Margherita and Rita; in\r\nFrench, Marguerite, Margot, and Groten; in German, Margarethe, Gretchen,\r\nand Grethel; and in English, Margaret, Marjorie, Madge, Maggie, Peggy,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe use of the word as a proper name among the early Christians was\r\ndoubtless suggested by the sweet simplicity and loveliness of the pearl,\r\nand by the beautiful symbolical references to this gem in the\r\nScriptures; and the meaning of the name has been strengthened by the\r\npure lives and the good deeds of the many beautiful Margarets in all\r\nlands, including the virgin martyr, St. Margaret of Antioch, “the mild\r\nmaid of God” referred to in the Liturgy, who, before the fifth century,\r\nwas the embodiment of feminine innocence and faith overcoming evil, and\r\nwho is often represented wearing a string of pearls; also St. Margaret\r\nÆtheling of the eleventh century, who endeared the name in Scotland, was\r\ncanonized in 1215, and was adopted as the patron saint of Scotland in\r\n1673; and Margaret, “Pearl of Bohemia,” so beloved by the Danes.\r\n\r\nEspecially among the Germans has the name a tender significance; with\r\nthem it is symbolical of maidenly sweetness and purity associated with\r\nrichness of womanhood, such as was typified by Goethe in the heroine of\r\nhis “Faust.” This idea may have impelled Wordsworth in the selection of\r\na name for the lovely, girlish character in his “Excursion”; and\r\nTennyson for his “Sweet pale Margaret,” and likewise Scott for “Ladye\r\nMargaret, the flower of Teviot.” With the memory of these lives and\r\ncharacters before her, many a loving mother has crystallized the hope\r\nentertained for a baby daughter by enriching her with this beautiful\r\nname.\r\n\r\nPoets seem never to tire of using the pearl as a symbol of perfection in\r\nform, in purity, in luster, and in sweetness. But probably none has made\r\na more lovely comparison than Owen Meredith:\r\n\r\n                                As pure as a pearl,\r\n            And as perfect: a noble and innocent girl.[349]\r\n\r\nThe Oriental poets unite with those of the West in their love for this\r\ngem, and those gifted writers are lavish in its use. Let us but add the\r\nlament of Shabl Abdullah on the death of Nozami:\r\n\r\n           Nozami’s gone, our fairest pearl is lost.\r\n           From purest dew, kind Heaven had given her birth,\r\n           And then had fashioned her the pearl supreme.\r\n           She softly shone, but hidden from mankind,\r\n           So God has now restored her to her shell.\r\n\r\nFar more crude, but possibly equally pathetic, is that old epitaph from\r\nYorkshire, England:\r\n\r\n             In shells and gold pearls are not kept alone,\r\n             A Margaret here lies beneath a stone.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, Pierre de Rosnel wrote in a burst of\r\nenthusiasm:\r\n\r\n  The pearl is a jewel so perfect that its excellent beauty demands\r\n  the love and esteem of the whole universe. Suidas expresses himself\r\n  in regard to it thus: “The possession of the pearl is one of love’s\r\n  greatest delights; the delight of possessing it suffices to feed\r\n  love.” In a painting, Philostratus, who had the same ideas, has\r\n  represented cupids with bows enriched with pearls; and the ancients\r\n  were all agreed to dedicate the pearl to Venus. Now, to my thinking,\r\n  the reason for their so doing was, that inasmuch as this goddess of\r\n  love, the fairest of all divinities, is descended from heaven and is\r\n  formed of the sea, so in like manner the pearl—the loveliest of all\r\n  gems—is formed in the sea and is the offspring of the dew of heaven.\r\n  But he that would learn more of the excellence of the pearl, let him\r\n  inquire of the ladies, who will relate much more in its praise than\r\n  I can write, and who will doubtless confess that nothing else so\r\n  well adorns them.[350]\r\n\r\nEmblematic as the pearl is of maidenly purity and sweetness, it is\r\ndeemed especially appropriate as a wedding gift. This use dates from the\r\nearliest dawn of Hindu civilization, when the beloved Krishna drew it\r\nfrom the sea to decorate his beautiful daughter on her nuptial day. And\r\namong the Hindus not uncommonly the presentation of a virgin pearl and\r\nits piercing forms part of the marriage ceremony. In most of the\r\nEuropean royal weddings in recent years, pearls have been prominent\r\namong the bridal gifts; nor have they been overlooked among the presents\r\nto American brides, including one much in the public print about 1906,\r\nfor whom a necklace of them was selected by a neighboring republic as an\r\nappropriate present.\r\n\r\nThe dedication of the pearl to love and marriage appears to have been\r\nrecognized by the artistic Greeks. One of the choicest engravings\r\npreserved from classic times is a magnificent sardonyx showing the\r\nmarriage of Cupid and Psyche, in which the lovers are united by what\r\nsome authorities consider a string of pearls—emblematic of conjugal\r\nbonds—by means of which the god Hymen leads them to the nuptial\r\ncouch.[351] This engraved gem now forms one of the choicest objects in\r\nthe Boston Museum of Fine Arts, having been purchased at the sale of the\r\nMarlborough gems, London, 1898, at a cost of about $10,000.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in Western countries the ill omen of pearls as bridal ornaments\r\nhas been widely recognized, these determining the tears that will be\r\nshed in the married life. As Milton says, referring to the Marchioness\r\nof Winchester:\r\n\r\n                   And those pearls of dew she wears,\r\n                   Prove to be presaging tears.\r\n\r\nIt was told that when the Empress Eugénie of France was finishing her\r\ntoilet preparatory to her wedding in Notre Dame in 1853, a personal\r\nattendant reminded her of the omen, and begged that she refrain from\r\nwearing her pearl necklace on that occasion. Eugenie paid no heed to the\r\nwarning and wore the beautiful jewels just the same; and, as all the\r\nworld knows, her life has been one long tragedy. Since that necklace was\r\na lengthy one, containing very many pearls, the bride who wears only a\r\nfew on her wedding day need not dread the adage so much, for,\r\nunfortunately, no woman’s life is wholly free from grief; and most\r\nbrides would doubtless risk a few tears rather than refuse to wear a\r\nwedding gift of pearls.\r\n\r\nIt was a very old idea that to dream of pearls betokens tears. A\r\nsuggestion of this occurs in John Webster’s “Duchess of Malfi” (1623),\r\nAct III, sc. 5:\r\n\r\n            _Duchess_: I had a very strange dream to-night;\r\n                       Methought I wore my coronet of state,\r\n                       And on a sudaine all the diamonds\r\n                       Were chang’d to pearles.\r\n\r\n            _Antonio_: My interpretation\r\n                       Is, you’ll weepe shortly;\r\n                       For to me the pearles\r\n                       Doe signifie your teares.\r\n\r\nAnd we quote also from “The Parson’s Wedding” (1663), Act II, sc. 5,\r\nwhere Jolly exclaims: “What! in thy dumps, brother? The captain sad!\r\n’Tis prophetic. I’d as lieve have dreamt of pearl, or the loss of my\r\nteeth.”\r\n\r\nTradition relates that Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV of\r\nScotland, just before the battle of Flodden Field (1513), had many fears\r\nas to the disastrous issue of that conflict, owing to having dreamed on\r\nthree nights in succession that all her jewels were suddenly turned into\r\npearls. This was interpreted as a sign of coming widowhood and sorrow,\r\nwhich was soon verified; and a similar story is told of Marie de’ Medici\r\nshortly before the murder of Henry IV of France in 1610.\r\n\r\nThe employment of pearls medicinally dates from an ancient period. This\r\nuse is mentioned in the oldest existing Sanskrit medical work, the\r\n“Charaka-Samhita,”[352] composed early in the Christian era; and\r\nlikewise in the somewhat more modern “Susruta,”[353] which probably\r\noriginated before the eighth century.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly in Oriental countries that therapeutic properties\r\nhave been credited to pearls. The powder of these gems has been rated\r\nvery highly there, and is still used to some extent. It was considered\r\nbeneficial in cases of ague, indigestion, and hemorrhages, and was\r\nregarded as possessing stimulative qualities. Medical literature of the\r\nOrient contains many accounts of the uses of pearls and of the methods\r\nof forming them into pills, ointments, etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to a treatise written by Narahari, a physician of Kashmir,\r\nabout 1240 A.D., the pearl cures diseases of the eyes, is an antidote to\r\npoisons, cures consumption and morbid disturbances, and increases\r\nstrength and general health.[354]\r\n\r\nIn China, as well as in other Asiatic countries, a distinction was made\r\nin the therapeutic effects of so-called “virgin” pearls and of those\r\npierced or bored for stringing. The Chinese natural history of Li Shi\r\nChin, completed about 1596, states that bored pearls will not serve for\r\nmedicine, for which unpierced ones should be used. It further adds that\r\nthe taste is saltish, sweetish, and cold; and that they benefit the\r\nliver, clear the eyes, and cure deafness. Dr. T. Nishikawa informs us\r\nthat at the present time many Mytilus seed-pearls are exported from\r\nJapan to China for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nQuoting principally from Ahmed Teifashi, Whitelow Ainslie wrote in 1825\r\nthat Arabian physicians suppose the powder of the pearl to have virtues\r\nin weak eyes; and they credit it with efficacy in palpitations, nervous\r\ntremors, melancholia, and hemorrhage. Also they have this strange\r\nnotion, that when applied externally and while in the shell, it cures\r\nleprosy.[355]\r\n\r\nStatements of the curative properties of pearls come also from Japan at\r\na somewhat recent date. The catalogue of the National Exhibition at Yedo\r\nin 1877, Part V, page 78, notes that they soothe the heart, lessen\r\nphlegm, are an antidote to poison, and cure fever, smallpox, and\r\nblear-eyedness.\r\n\r\nThe popular modern idea in India as to the therapeutic value was thus\r\nexpressed by a native prince, Sourindro Mohun Tagore, Mus. Doc., the\r\nMaharajah of Tagore, in 1881:\r\n\r\n  The use of pearls conduces to contentment of mind and to strength of\r\n  body and soul. The burnt powder of this gem, if taken with water as\r\n  sherbet, cures vomiting of blood of all kinds. It prevents evil\r\n  spirits working mischief in the minds of men, takes off bad smell\r\n  from the mouth, cures lunacy of all descriptions and all mental\r\n  diseases, jaundice and all diseases of the heart, intestines and\r\n  stomach. Burnt pearl mixed with water and taken into the nostrils,\r\n  as a powder, takes away headsickness, cures cataract, lachryma and\r\n  swelling of the eyes, the painful sensation such as is caused by the\r\n  entry of sand into them, and ulcers. Used as a dentifrice, it\r\n  strengthens the gums and cleanses the teeth. Rubbed on the body with\r\n  other medicines, it cures all skin diseases. It stops bleeding from\r\n  cuts and ultimately heals them up. Whether taken internally or\r\n  externally, it is a sure antidote to poison. It drives away all\r\n  imaginary fears and removes all bodily pain. To prevent its tendency\r\n  to affect the brain, it should always be used with the burnt powder\r\n  of basud, and in its absence with that of white mother-of-pearl. The\r\n  dose of pearl-powder should not exceed 2¼ mashas [19.68 grs.].[356]\r\n\r\nThe Hindus credited specific virtues to pearls of different colors: the\r\nyellow brought wealth, the honey shade fostered understanding, the white\r\nattracted fame, and the blue, good luck. Defective pearls caused\r\nleprosy, loss of fortune, disgrace, insanity, and death, according to\r\nthe degree of defect. The “Mani-málá,” previously quoted, states that\r\n“pearls possessed of every valuable quality shield their master from\r\nevery evil, and suffer nothing harmful to come near him. The house which\r\ncontains a perfect pearl the ever-restless Lakshmi (goddess of wealth)\r\nchooses to make her dwelling for ever and a day.”[357]\r\n\r\nA similar idea is expressed in an old Hindu treatise on gems by\r\nBuddhabhatta, where we read: “The pearl from the shell ought always to\r\nbe worn as an amulet by those who desire prosperity.”[358]\r\n\r\nPearls still find a place in the pharmacopœia of India. One of the\r\nlatest standard works, that of R. N. Khory and N. N. Katrak,[359]\r\ncredits the powder as a stimulant, tonic, and aphrodisiac. It is one of\r\nthe ingredients in numerous Indian prescriptions used in curing\r\nimpotence, heart-disease, consumption, etc. According to these\r\nauthorities, the dose is from one fourth to one half grain of the\r\npowdered pearl.\r\n\r\nOwing to the high cost of sea pearls, even those of the smallest size, a\r\nsubstitute for medicinal and similar purposes is found in the Placuna\r\npearls of Ceylon, Borneo, etc. These are of such slight luster that only\r\nthe choicest are of ornamental value, consequently they are sold at\r\nrelatively small prices. A considerable demand exists for them to be\r\nplaced in the mouths of deceased Hindus of the middle class, instead of\r\nthe sea pearls which are used by the wealthy, or the rice which is\r\nemployed in a similar manner by persons of poorer rank. This custom\r\nseems to be analogous to that of the ancient Britons, and also to that\r\nof the American Indians, in depositing food and other requisites for a\r\njourney in burial graves. The practice is an old one in India and was\r\nnoted by Marco Polo more than six hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nMost of the Placuna pearls are calcined and are used with areca-nuts and\r\nbetel-pepper leaves in a very popular masticatory, one of the “seven\r\nsisters of sleep,” which is to the Hindu what opium is to the Chinaman,\r\nor tobacco to the American or European. The hard white areca-nut (_Areca\r\nCatechu_) is about the size and shape of a hen’s egg. Three or four\r\nthousand tons of the small, tender nuts are annually shipped from Ceylon\r\nto India for this masticatory, which is chewed by a hundred million\r\npersons. After boiling in water, pellets of them are placed in a leaf of\r\nthe betel-pepper (_Piper betle_) with a small quantity of lime made from\r\npearls or shells, according to the desired quality and value of product.\r\nIt is credited with hardening the gums, sweetening the breath, aiding\r\ndigestion, and stimulating the nervous system like coffee or tobacco;\r\nits most visible effect is tingeing the saliva and blackening the teeth,\r\nwhich is far from attractive, especially in an otherwise beautiful\r\nwoman. A more recent use for these Placuna pearls is as an ingredient in\r\na proprietary face powder and enamel, which is marketed in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is not alone the Orientals that have found medicinal virtues in\r\npearls. Even in Europe they have occupied a prominent place in materia\r\nmedica, especially during the Middle Ages when a knowledge of the occult\r\nproperties of gems was an important branch of learning. Indeed, they\r\ncould scarcely have been overlooked by people who at one time or another\r\nswallowed pretty much everything, from dried snake’s eyes to the filings\r\nof a murderer’s irons, in their quest for the unusual and costly with\r\nwhich to relieve and comfort themselves. During the Middle Ages in\r\nEurope, writers who gave attention to pearls, as well as to other gems,\r\ntreated almost exclusively of their reputed efficacy in magic and in\r\nmedicine; and most of the accounts from the ninth to the fourteenth\r\ncentury seem wholly without scientific value, and at times reach the\r\nclimax of extravagance and absurdity in their claims for the wonderful\r\npotency of the gem.\r\n\r\nAlbertus Magnus, the Dominican scholar born in Germany in the twelfth\r\ncentury, wrote that pearls were used in mental diseases, in affections\r\nof the heart, in hemorrhages, and dysentery.[360]\r\n\r\nThe “Lapidario” of Alfonso X of Castile (1221–1284), called “The Wise,”\r\nthe father of the Spanish language, states:\r\n\r\n  The pearl is most excellent in the medicinal art, for it is of great\r\n  help in palpitation of the heart, and for those who are sad or\r\n  timid, and in every sickness which is caused by melancholia, because\r\n  it purifies the blood, clears it and removes all its impurities.\r\n  Therefore, the physicians put them in their medicine and lectuaries,\r\n  with which they cure these infirmities, and give them to be\r\n  swallowed. They also make powders of them, which are applied to the\r\n  eyes; because they clear the sight wonderfully, strengthen the\r\n  nerves and dry up the moisture which enters the eyes.[361]\r\n\r\nAnselmus de Boot, physician to Emperor Rudolph II, and one of the great\r\nauthorities at the beginning of the seventeenth century, gave the\r\nfollowing directions for making “_aqua perlata_, which is most excellent\r\nfor restoring the strength and almost for resuscitating the dead.\r\nDissolve the pearls in strong vinegar, or better in lemon juice, or in\r\nspirits of vitriol or sulphur, until they become liquified; fresh juice\r\nis then added and the first decanted. Then, to the milky and turbid\r\nsolution, add enough sugar to sweeten it. If there be four ounces of\r\nthis solution, add an ounce each of rose-water, of tincture of\r\nstrawberries, of borage flowers and of balm and two ounces of cinnamon\r\nwater. When you wish to give the medicine, shake the mixture so that the\r\nsediment may be swallowed at the same time. From one ounce to an ounce\r\nand a half may be taken, and nothing more excellent can be had. In\r\npernicious and pestilential fevers, the ordinary _aqua perlata_ cannot\r\nbe compared to this. Care must be taken to cover the glass carefully\r\nwhile the pearls are dissolving, lest the essence should escape.”[362]\r\n\r\nA curious book on the medicinal use of pearls was written in 1637 by\r\nMalachias Geiger,[363] in which he especially praises the efficacy of\r\nBavarian pearls. It was true that their material value was less than\r\nthat of oriental pearls, but this was compensated by their therapeutic\r\nqualities. He had accomplished many cures of a very serious disease and\r\nhad used these pearls successfully in cases of epilepsy, insanity, and\r\nmelancholia.\r\n\r\nQuotations might be given from a hundred medieval writers as to the\r\ntherapeutics of pearls. The diseases for which they were recommended, as\r\nnoted by Robert Lovell’s “Panmineralogicon, or Summe of all Authors,”\r\npublished at Oxford in 1661, seems to have included a large portion of\r\nthe entire list known at that period. This summary states:\r\n\r\n  Pearls strengthen and confirme the heart; they cherish the spirits\r\n  and principall parts of the body; being put into collyries, they\r\n  cleanse weafts of the eyes, and dry up the water thereof, help their\r\n  filth, and strengthen the nerves by which moisture floweth into\r\n  them; they are very good against melancholick griefes; they helpe\r\n  those that are subject to cardiack passions; they defend against\r\n  pestilent diseases, and are mixed with cordiall remedies; they are\r\n  good against the lienterie, that is, the flux of the belly,\r\n  proceeding from the sliperiness of the intestines, insomuch that\r\n  they cannot retaine the meat, but let it passe undigested; they are\r\n  good against swounings; they help the trembling of the heart and\r\n  giddinesse of the head; they are mixed with the _Manus Christi_\r\n  against fainting (called _Manus Christi perlata_ in the London\r\n  _Pharmacopaea_); they are put into antidotes or corroborating\r\n  powders; they help the flux of bloud; they stop the terms, and\r\n  cleanse the teeth; they are put into antidotes for the bowels, and\r\n  increase their vertue, make the bloud more thin, and clarify that\r\n  which is more thick and feculent; they help feavers. The _oile of\r\n  Pearles_ or unions helpeth the resolution of the nerves, convulsion,\r\n  decay of old age, phrensie, keepeth the body sound, and recovereth\r\n  it when out of order, it rectifieth womens milk, and increaseth it,\r\n  corrects the vices of the natural parts and seed. It cureth\r\n  absesses, eating ulcers, the cancer and hemorrhoides.... The best\r\n  are an excellent cordial, by which the oppressed balsame of life and\r\n  decayed strength are recreated and strengthened, therefore they\r\n  resist poyson, the plague, and putrefaction, and exhilarate, and\r\n  therefore they are used as the last remedie in sick persons.[364]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RUSSIAN EIKON OF THE MADONNA\r\n\r\n  Ornamented with pearls\r\n]\r\n\r\nSo powerful and mysterious were their alleged virtues, that in some\r\ninstances it was necessary only that the pearls be worn to make\r\neffective their prophylaxis against disease. This belief was by no means\r\nconfined to the ignorant and inexperienced, for we are told that even\r\nPope Adrian was never without his amulet made of the extraordinary\r\ncombination of oriental pearls, a dried toad, etc.[365] Leonardo, in the\r\nfifteenth century, wrote that pearls render true and virtuous all who\r\nwear them.[366] Although we wonder at what we call the superstitions of\r\nthe Middle Ages, perchance future generations will smile at many of our\r\nmistaken follies.\r\n\r\nA prominent historical instance of administering pearls medicinally was\r\nin the treatment of Charles VI of France (1368–1422), to whom pearl\r\npowder mixed with distilled water was given for the cure of insanity.\r\n\r\nA far more illustrious patient was Lorenzo de’ Medici, “The Magnificent”\r\n(1448–1492), the celebrated ruler of Florence. When this plebeian prince\r\nlay dying of a fever at Careggi, just after that famous interview with\r\nSavonarola, his friends called in Lazaro da Ticino, a physician of\r\nreputation, who administered pulverized pearls. Politian, who was\r\npresent, is credited with the statement that when the medicine was\r\nadministered, to the inquiry as to how it tasted, Lorenzo replied: “As\r\npleasant as anything can be to a dying man.”[367]\r\n\r\nEven the English philosopher, Francis Bacon (1561–1626), mentioned\r\npearls among medicines for the prolongation of life. He adds: “Pearls\r\nare taken, either in a fine powder or in a kind of paste or solution\r\nmade by the juice of very sour and fresh lemons. Sometimes they are\r\ngiven in aromatic confections, sometimes in a fluid form. Pearls no\r\ndoubt have some affinity with the shells wherein they grow; perhaps may\r\nhave nearly the same qualities as the shells of crawfish.”[368]\r\n\r\nPowdered pearl or mother-of-pearl mixed with lemon juice was used as a\r\nwash for the face, and was considered “the best in the world.”[369] The\r\npearl powder and lemon juice were permitted to stand for a day or two\r\nand the combination was then filtered before using. Another method of\r\npreparing this was:\r\n\r\n  Dissolve two or three ounces of fine seed-pearl in distilled\r\n  vinegar, and when it is perfectly dissolved, pour the vinegar into a\r\n  clean basin; then drop some oil of tartar upon it, and it will cast\r\n  down the pearl into fine powder; then pour the vinegar clean off\r\n  softly; put to the pearl clear conduit or spring water; pour that\r\n  off, and do so often until the taste of the vinegar and tartar be\r\n  clean gone; then dry the powder of pearl upon warm embers, and keep\r\n  it for your use.[370]\r\n\r\nThrough their composition of carbonate of lime, pearls possibly possess\r\nsome slight therapeutic value, which, however, can easily be supplied by\r\nother materials—as the shell, for instance—and is entirely out of\r\nproportion to their market value as ornaments.\r\n\r\nAlthough pearls have lost their therapeutic prestige and no longer have\r\na recognized place in materia medica, their healing qualities are not to\r\nbe denied, for there are few ills to which women are subject that cannot\r\nbe bettered or at least endured with greater patience when the sufferer\r\nreceives a gift of pearls; the truth of which any doubting Thomas may\r\neasily verify in his own household to the limit of his purse-strings.\r\n\r\nOwing to their beauty and great value, pearls have been deemed\r\nparticularly appropriate as a sacrifice in enriching a drink for a toast\r\nor tribute. Shakspere alludes to this in the words of King Claudius, the\r\npearl being frequently designated _union_ in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies:\r\n\r\n            The king shall drink to Hamlet’s better breath;\r\n            And in the cup an union shall he throw,\r\n            Richer than that which four successive kings\r\n            In Denmark’s crown have worn.[371]\r\n\r\nIt is stated that a pearl worth £15,000 was reduced to powder and drunk\r\nby Sir Thomas Gresham, the English merchant, in the presence of the\r\nSpanish ambassador, as a tribute to Queen Elizabeth, by whom he had been\r\nknighted.[372]\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated instance of enriching a drink with a pearl was\r\ndoubtless Cleopatra’s tribute to Antony, Pliny’s account of which we\r\ngive in the words of old Philemon Holland:\r\n\r\n  This princesse, when _M. Antonius_ had strained himselfe to doe her\r\n  all the pleasure he possibly could, and had feasted her day by day\r\n  most sumptuously, and spared for no cost: in the hight of her pride\r\n  and wanton braverie (as being a noble courtezan, and a queene\r\n  withall) began to debase the expense and provision of Antonie, and\r\n  made no reckoning of all his costly fare. When he thereat demanded\r\n  againe how it was possible to goe beyond this magnificence of his,\r\n  she answered againe, that she would spend upon him at one supper ten\r\n  million Sestertij. _Antonie_ laid a great wager with her about it,\r\n  and shee bound it againe, and made it good. The morrow after,\r\n  _Cleopatra_ made _Antonie_ a supper which was sumptuous and roiall\r\n  ynough: howbeit, there was no extraordinarie service seene upon the\r\n  board: whereat _Antonius_ laughed her to scorne, and by way of\r\n  mockerie required to see a bill with the account of the particulars.\r\n  She again said, that whatsoever had been served up alreadie was but\r\n  the overplus above the rate and proportion in question, affirming\r\n  still that she would yet in that supper make up the full summe that\r\n  she was seazed at: yea, herselfe alone would eat above that\r\n  reckoning, and her owne supper should cost 60 million Sestertij: and\r\n  with that commanded the second service to be brought in. The\r\n  servitors set before her one only crewet of sharpe vineger, the\r\n  strength whereof is able to resolve pearles. Now she had at her\r\n  eares hanging these two most precious pearles, the singular and only\r\n  jewels of the world, and even Natures wonder. As _Antonie_ looked\r\n  wistly upon her, shee tooke one of them from her eare, steeped it in\r\n  the vineger, and so soon as it was liquified, dranke it off. And as\r\n  she was about to doe the like by the other, _L. Plancius_ the judge\r\n  of that wager, laid fast hold upon it with his hand, and pronounced\r\n  withal, that _Antonie_ had lost the wager.[373]\r\n\r\nElsewhere has been set forth the impracticability of dissolving a pearl\r\nin a glass of vinegar without first pulverizing it.[374] It seems\r\nprobable that if Pliny’s interesting story has any foundation, Cleopatra\r\nmight have swallowed a solid pearl in a glass of wine—certainly a more\r\npleasing draught as well as a more graphic sacrifice; and we should\r\naccept its reported value with a grain of salt, for it would scarcely\r\nhave been safe for the court gossip to belittle the value of this\r\ntribute of love.\r\n\r\nPliny, and other Roman writers, mention another instance, that of\r\nClodius “the sonne of Aesope the Tragedian Poet,” who took two pearls of\r\ngreat price “in a braverie, and to know what tast pearles had, mortified\r\nthem in venegre, and drunke them up. And finding them to content his\r\npalat wondrous well, because he would not have all the pleasure by\r\nhimselfe, and know the goodnesse thereof alone, he gave to every guest\r\nat his table one pearle apeece to drinke in like manner.”[375] The\r\nchronicler fails to tell what the guests thought of the flavor of\r\npearls, or whether some would not have preferred them for a more\r\nappropriate use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIII\r\n\r\n                     VALUES AND COMMERCE OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIII\r\n                     VALUES AND COMMERCE OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           A pearl,\r\n   Whose price hath launch’d above a thousand ships,\r\n   And turn’d crown’d kings to merchants.\r\n\r\n                               _Troilus and Cressida_, Act II, sc. 2.\r\n\r\nTo trace the markets of the pearl is to trace the routes of commerce\r\nfrom early times. The first routes from the Far East seem to have been\r\ntwo: one by the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates to Babylonia and Assyria,\r\nand thence by caravan through Damascus to Tyre and Sidon; the other by\r\nthe Red Sea and Suez to Egypt. As regards the former route, Sir George\r\nBirdwood furnishes positive evidence that the Phenicians visited India\r\nas early as 2200 B.C. It seems highly probable that pearls were\r\nintroduced by this route at an early period, although it is difficult to\r\nfind material proof of the fact.\r\n\r\nBy means of this commerce, the great ancient civilizations of Phenicia,\r\nMesapotamia and the Nile valley doubtless became familiar with the gem\r\ntreasures of eastern Asia. Then came the opening of the Mediterranean\r\nwith first “the great Sidon,” and later Tyre, as the starting-points of\r\ncommerce, exploration, and colonial settlement among the islands and on\r\nthe shores of what, to the Asiatic peoples, was the great western sea.\r\nHowever, as the Greek islands and their colonies developed, the\r\nPhenicians were more strictly confined to the coasts of Africa and\r\nSpain. Gades, Tartessus, and Carthage were their great colonies and\r\ntrading-ports, and their adventurous sailors passed on through the\r\nStraits of Gibraltar and directed their course northward to the British\r\nIsles, where they very probably obtained the pearls of the Scotch\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the campaigns of Alexander had carried Greek influence and\r\nauthority over all western Asia, reaching even to India itself, and had\r\nled to a widely increased intercourse. Although he died at the age of\r\nthirty-two, Alexander the Great did more than any single individual in\r\nthe world’s history to bring the nations of the Eastern and the Western\r\nworlds into contact with each other, and it is certainly due to this\r\ncircumstance that we find much greater evidences of the use of pearls in\r\nthe western countries after his time. Besides this, the founding of\r\nAlexandria provided a mart, in whose bazaars the traders of India,\r\nPersia, and Arabia bartered their treasured gems, just as their\r\ndescendants do in the same place at the present day.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until the establishment of the Roman empire that\r\nthis commercial intercourse reached its highest development. The Romans,\r\nwith their marvelous capacity for organization, were the first to build\r\na great system of permanent and well-kept roads to facilitate land\r\ntravel and land traffic. These great roads, starting from the Forum,\r\nreached out in every direction, even to the limits of the empire; and,\r\nas a result of increased commercial activity, more gems were engraved,\r\nmounted, and set during the five hundred years of Rome’s commercial\r\nsupremacy than during any other early epoch of the world’s history.\r\n\r\nIn Rome, the trade in pearls was so important that there was a\r\ncorporation of “margaritarii.” The _officinæ margaritariorum_ were\r\ninstalled in the Forum, in the neighborhood of the _tabernae\r\nargentariæ_; some were also on the Via Sacra.[376] However, the name\r\n_margaritarius_ did not only apply to the jewelers, merchants, and\r\nsetters of pearls, but also to those who fished for them and to the\r\nguardians of the gems and jewels wherein pearls were used.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the Western empire, the Dark Ages settled down like a\r\ncloud over Europe for five hundred years. Only among the Saracens and at\r\nByzantium did the culture of the old civilization survive, and\r\neventually the light of knowledge and of progress was rekindled from\r\nthese sources. The Crusades were the chief factors in this new\r\ndevelopment; they gave a mighty stimulus, by means of which Europe was\r\naroused from her lethargy and once more brought into contact with the\r\nOrient. Venice and Genoa now became the great carriers, and from this\r\ntime, and to this source, may be traced many of the oriental gems in\r\nEurope. The Venetian fleet of three hundred merchant ships brought the\r\nproducts of the East and distributed them over Europe, by way of the\r\nGerman cities of Augsburg and Nuremberg, where the great jewelers and\r\nsilversmiths made world-famed ornaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PECTORAL CROSS OF CONSTANTINE IX. MONOMACHUS (1000–1054 A.D.)\r\n\r\n  Containing some wood attributed to the true cross.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen Constantinople fell into the hands of the Turks, the treasures of\r\nthe Eastern empire were scattered throughout Europe; but, at the same\r\ntime, the establishment of the Turkish empire served to close the way to\r\nIndia and the far East for the merchants and travelers of Europe, and,\r\nhence, new means of access had to be sought by sea. This, as is well\r\nknown, was the cause of the voyages of De Gama and Columbus. The\r\nunexpected result of these voyages—the discovery of a new\r\ncontinent—ushered in the wonderful period of Spanish and Portuguese\r\ndevelopment and their colonization of both the East and the West Indies;\r\nand to this epoch belongs the introduction of American pearls to the\r\nmarkets of Europe. The gradual decline of the power of Spain and\r\nPortugal—largely owing to bigotry and to the reckless exploitation of\r\nthe regions under their control—brings us to the beginning of the\r\npresent phase of commercial intercourse in which all the nations of the\r\ncivilized world are engaged in varying proportion, according to their\r\npower and aptitude. Never before have the different regions of the earth\r\nbeen more closely in touch with each other, and we may safely say that\r\nnothing is likely to occur which can permanently interrupt the\r\nprogressive development of the world’s commerce.\r\n\r\nWith the various means of transportation and locomotion that have\r\nexisted in the past twenty-three or twenty-four centuries, there is no\r\ndoubt that the commerce of pearls has varied more or less, but there has\r\never been, in some part of the world, a great potentate, a great\r\ncollector or dealer who has influenced the finest gems to gravitate his\r\nway. Never has there been a time when some person was not prepared to\r\nencourage—and to richly encourage—the sale of fine jewels to him. The\r\nhistory of the commerce of precious stones is a history of travel and\r\nexploration, of hardship, pleasure, reward, and sometimes of serious\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThe lesson we derive from these decorative objects of natural beauty and\r\nsoftness—treasured alike by savage, barbarian, ancient warrior,\r\nstatesman, king, emperor, peasant, bourgeois, magyar, lady, and\r\nqueen—always carries with it the moral that the gifts of creation are\r\never prized by some one in every age or place.\r\n\r\nThe necessary qualifications affecting the value of a pearl are: first,\r\nthat it should be perfectly round, pear-shaped, drop-shaped, egg-shaped,\r\nor button-shaped, and as even in form as though it were turned on a\r\nlathe. It must have a perfectly clear skin, and a decided color or tint,\r\nwhether white, pink, creamy, gray, brown or black. If white, it must not\r\nhave a cloud or a blur or haze, nor should the skin have the slightest\r\nappearance of being opaque or dead. It must be absolutely free from all\r\ncracks, scratches, spots, flaws, indentations, shadowy reflections or\r\nblemishes of any kind. It must possess the peculiar luster or orient\r\ncharacteristic of the gem. The skin must be unbroken, and not show any\r\nevidence of having been polished.\r\n\r\nDiamonds and the more valuable precious stones generally are bought and\r\nsold by the weight called a carat. This carat, whatever its precise\r\nvalue, is always considered as divisible into four diamond or pearl\r\ngrains, but the subdivisions of the carat are usually expressed by the\r\nvulgar fractions, one fourth, one eighth, one twelfth, one sixteenth,\r\none twenty-fourth, one thirty-second, and one sixty-fourth. The origin\r\nof the carat is to be sought in certain small, hard, leguminous seeds,\r\nwhich, when dried, remain constant in weight. The brilliant, glossy,\r\nscarlet-and-black seed of _Abrus precatorius_ constitutes the Indian\r\nrati, about three grains; the _Adenanthera pavonina_ seed weighs about\r\nfour grains. The seed of the locust-tree, _Ceratonia siliqua_, weighs on\r\nthe average three and one sixth grains, and constitutes, no doubt, the\r\ntrue origin of the carat.\r\n\r\nAnother[377] of the more notable of these weight-units used for precious\r\nstones and precious metals is the _candarin_, _condorine_, or\r\n_cantarai_, also termed by the Chinese _fun_ or _fan_, and by the south\r\nIndians a _fanam_, and used all over the Indo-Chinese archipelago. This\r\nis by origin a large lentil or pea of a pinkish color dotted with black,\r\nabout double the size of the _gonj_, and possessing the same quality of\r\nvery slight variability of weight when dried. It is probably a variety\r\nof the same botanic genus or species as the _Abrus precatorius_. The\r\nvalue when reduced to absolute standard became a subsidiary part or\r\nsubmultiple of the weight of some local coin, rupee, or pagoda, or a\r\ndecimal fraction of some local tchen, as in China and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe following derivation of the word carat is given by Grimm: “Carat.\r\nItalian: _carato_; French: _carat_; Spanish and Portuguese: _quilate_;\r\nOld Portuguese: _quirate_, from Arabic _qirat_, and this from the Greek,\r\nκεράτιον.”[378]\r\n\r\nThe carat is not absolutely of the same value in all countries. Its\r\nweight, as used for weighing the diamond, pearl, and other gemstones in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, is given in decimals of a gram, by the\r\nmajority of the authorities, as follows:\r\n\r\n                                 Grams            In Grains Troy\r\n   Indian (Madras)       .2073533              3.199948\r\n   Austrian (Vienna)     .20613+               3.18107+\r\n   German (Frankfort)    .20577+               3.175514\r\n   Brazil and Portugal   .20575+               3.175206\r\n   France                .2055+                3.171347\r\n   England               .205409               3.169943\r\n   Spain                 .205393               3.169696\r\n   Holland               .205044               3.16431+\r\n\r\n                         Pearl Grains in Grams    In Grains Troy\r\n   Indian (Madras)       .0518383              .799987\r\n   Austrian (Vienna)     .05153+               .79526+\r\n   German (Frankfort)    .05144+               .793878\r\n   Brazil and Portugal   .05143+               .793801\r\n   France                .051375               .792836\r\n   England               .051352               .792485\r\n   Spain                 .051348               .792424\r\n   Holland               .051261               .791077\r\n\r\nAssuming that the gram corresponds to 15.43235 English grains, an\r\nEnglish diamond carat will nearly equal 3.17 grains. It is, however,\r\nspoken of as being equal to four grains, the grains meant being\r\n“diamond” or “pearl” grains, and not ordinary troy or avoirdupois\r\ngrains. Thus a diamond or pearl grain is but .7925 of a true grain. In\r\nan English troy ounce of 480 grains there are 151½ carats; and so it\r\nwill be seen that a carat is not indeed quite 3.17 grains, but something\r\nlike 3.1683168 grains, or less exactly, 3.168 grains. Further, if we\r\naccept the equivalent in grains of one gram to be, as stated above,\r\n15.43235, and if there be 151½ carats in a troy ounce of 480 grains, it\r\nwill follow that an English diamond carat is .205304 of a gram,\r\nnot .205409, as commonly affirmed. The following exact equivalents, in\r\nmetric grams and grains troy, of the diamond carat as used in different\r\nparts of the world in 1882, are given by Mr. Lowis d’A.

The stock-book of a jeweler, at the present\r\ntime, will contain the following fractions, expressing the weight of a\r\nsingle pearl: ½, ¼, ⅛, 1⁄16, 1⁄32, 1⁄64, when the weight could be much\r\nbetter stated as 63⁄64 of a carat. It requires but a glance to see how\r\nmuch easier this would be. Certain dealers have therefore proposed the\r\nuse of sets of fractions arranged in a similar way. In this manner a\r\nstock-book can be kept much more easily and with greater precision.\r\nOthers, again, have adopted a decimal notation of the fractions of a\r\ncarat, which is even more simple and feasible, since the common\r\nfractions ½, ¼, ⅛, etc. can be expressed as .5, .25, .125, etc., of a\r\ncarat, this being either a carat of .2053 of a gram or the English carat\r\nof .20534 of a gram.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an agreement was arrived at, as the result of a\r\nconference between the diamond merchants of London, Paris, and\r\nAmsterdam, by which the uniform weight of a diamond carat was fixed\r\nat .205 of a gram, making the pearl grain .05125 of a gram. This\r\nstandard, which was suggested in 1871, by a syndicate of Parisian\r\njewelers, goldsmiths, and others dealing in precious stones, was\r\nsubsequently (1877) confirmed. But there is still a lack of uniformity\r\nin the standard by which diamonds and pearls are bought and sold, and\r\nvery serious discrepancies exist in the sets of carat weights turned out\r\nby different makers, although the international carat is almost\r\nuniversally used.\r\n\r\nAt the International Congress of Weights and Measures held at the\r\nWorld’s Fair at Chicago in 1893, the writer suggested that the carat\r\nshould consist of 200 milligrams, so that ½ of a carat would be 100\r\nmilligrams and ¼ of a grain would be 12.5 milligrams. This would mean 5\r\ncarats or 20 grains to a French gram, and 5000 carats or 20,000 pearl\r\ngrains to a French kilogram. This would depreciate the present diamond\r\ncarat or pearl grain only about one per cent., and it would do away with\r\nthe needless series of carats and grains of the many nationalities. It\r\ncould be simply explained to any private individual in any country,\r\nespecially as there are only two countries which do not use the metric\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThis carat has been earnestly indorsed, its introduction advocated, and\r\nits merits clearly shown, by M. Guilliame, of the French Bureau des Arts\r\net Metiers, whose energetic work has found a reasonable cooperation, in\r\nthis country as well as in Europe, in introducing what will be a\r\nscientific, logical, comprehensive, and possibly the final and\r\ninternational carat; and any ancient, obsolete, or foreign carat can be\r\nreadily reduced to this carat once the metric value of the former is\r\ncomputed.\r\n\r\nThe Association of Diamond Merchants of Amsterdam has already, to avoid\r\nconfusion, fixed the value of the carat (17th October, 1890) at 1\r\nkilogram = 4875 carats, or 1 carat = 3.16561 grains troy = 205.128 mg.\r\nOne pearl grain = .7914 grains troy = 51.282 mg.; but the association\r\nhas decided that, in case of litigation, these values shall be\r\ndetermined by appointed bureaus, which would express them in grams and\r\nmilligrams, a most important and valuable decision, as the gram and the\r\nmilligram will always be known as weights of constant value.\r\n\r\nIn view of the difficulty of inducing the abolition of the carat in\r\ndifferent countries, the German Federation of Jewelers decided to\r\npetition the imperial government for authority to use the carat, in\r\norder that it might be legally recognized. Such a proposition not being\r\nin accord with the German laws in force on the subject of the metric\r\nsystem, it was proposed to substitute for the carats then in use one\r\ncarat only, weighing two hundred milligrams. This proposal was very\r\nfavorably received in trade circles and may be taken into consideration\r\nby the International Committee of Weights and Measures. The Commission\r\ndes Instruments et Travaux, to which this proposition was referred,\r\nrecommended its adoption to the committee in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“The Commission recognizes that it would be very desirable that the unit\r\nof weight of precious stones (the carat) which varies in different\r\ncountries, should be made uniform, and should be reduced to the nearest\r\nmetric equivalent. The weight of 200 mg., which is very close to the\r\ncarat most in use (205.5 mg.), would seem to be the best for this\r\npurpose. The Commission believes that there can be no objection to this\r\nstandard of 200 mg. being called ‘the metric carat’ in order to\r\nfacilitate the abolition of the old carat.”\r\n\r\nThis proposition, adopted at the meeting of the International Committee\r\non the 13th of April, was communicated to the more important\r\nassociations. The Chambre Syndicale de la Bijouterie, Joaillerie et\r\nOrfèvrerie de Paris, and the Chambre Syndicale des Négotiants en\r\nDiamants, Perles, Pierres Précieuses et des Lapidaires de Paris assured\r\nthe committee of their support of this measure.\r\n\r\nThe following is the text of the resolution which was passed by both the\r\nabove associations in January, 1906:\r\n\r\n“The Council, recognizing the advantages which would result to the\r\ninternational trade in precious stones from the use of a unit based on\r\nthe metric system, desires that the metric carat of 200 mg. be\r\nuniversally adopted.”\r\n\r\nThe German Federation of Jewelers passed the following resolution in\r\nAugust, 1906:\r\n\r\n“The German Federation considers that it is both necessary and\r\nadvantageous to replace the old carat by the metric carat of 200 mg.; it\r\nauthorizes its president to approach the imperial government and the\r\nInternational Bureau of Weights and Measures, and the foreign\r\nassociations in order that the metric carat may be introduced as soon as\r\npossible in all countries.”\r\n\r\nThe Chamber of Commerce of Antwerp promised, in a letter dated the 7th\r\nof December, 1906, to rescind a decision of 29th of April, 1895,\r\napproving the adoption of a carat of 205.3 mg., when the metric carat of\r\n200 mg. should come into universal use in the markets.\r\n\r\nThe Association of Jewelers and Goldsmiths of Prague formally authorized\r\nthe German Federation to act in its name, in order that the reform\r\nshould come about as soon as possible by international agreement, and\r\nthe Association of Goldsmiths of Copenhagen has declared its willingness\r\nto support the reform. The Committee of Weights and Measures in Belgium\r\nprepared a law for the adoption of the metric carat in December, 1906.\r\n\r\nMr. Larking, president of the Chamber of Commerce of Melbourne,\r\nAustralia, has transmitted by letter of September 16, 1907, the\r\nfollowing resolution of the Association of Manufacturing Jewelers of the\r\nColony of Victoria:\r\n\r\n“It is desirable that the carat weight should be the same in all\r\ncountries, and our association approves a metric carat of 200\r\nmilligrams.”\r\n\r\nOn October 16, 1907, the Association of Societies for the Protection of\r\nCommerce in the United Kingdom passed the following resolution:\r\n\r\n“The Committee of the Association approves the attempt to urge the\r\nadoption in all countries of an international carat of 200 milligrams,\r\nand hopes that, in the interest of the unification of weights, it will\r\nprove successful.”\r\n\r\nThe fourth General Conference of Weights and Measures, held in Paris in\r\nOctober, 1907, passed this resolution:\r\n\r\n“The Conference approves the proposition of the International Committee\r\nand declares that it sees no infringement of the integrity of the metric\r\nsystem in the adoption of the appellation ‘metric carat’ to designate a\r\nweight of 200 milligrams for the commerce in diamonds, pearls, and\r\nprecious stones.”[379]\r\n\r\nThe following resolution was passed by The Birmingham Jewelers’ and\r\nSilversmiths’ Association, January 23, 1908: “That the best thanks of\r\nthis Committee be conveyed to the Decimal Association for the good work\r\nthey are doing, and this Committee expresses the hope that all countries\r\nwill adopt an International Carat of 200 milligrams in weight.” Finally,\r\non March 11, 1908, the metric carat of 200 milligrams was adopted in\r\nSpain as the official carat for diamonds, pearls, and precious stones.\r\n\r\nPearls have become of so much importance to so many dealers that a\r\nspecial form of weight has been proposed for them. This would have a\r\ndiamond form and not a square form, and it would be stamped “Grain”\r\ninstead of “Carat.” Another set would be stamped in milligrams, the\r\nregular milligram weight with the pearl fraction above it, and they\r\ncould even be made round so as better to designate the pearl.\r\n\r\nThe great value of pearls has suggested the making of a gage, called the\r\nKunz gage, by means of which round pearls can be very accurately\r\nmeasured. Pearls of a given weight and perfectly spherical form have\r\nbeen weighed and then measured by this gage, and the theoretical\r\ndiameters as computed from the measurement of a single pearl are in the\r\nmajority of instances in exact accord with these actual measurements,\r\nthe occasional variations in the smaller pearls barely exceeding the\r\nthousandth part of an inch. These discrepancies may be due to\r\nimperceptible divergencies in sphericity or, possibly, to trifling\r\ndifferences in specific gravity.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the diameters of round pearls by measurement,\r\nfrom 1⁄16 to 500 grains, in millimeters and inches:\r\n\r\n               Weight Grains Diameter Millimeters Inches\r\n               1⁄16                           1.3  .0512\r\n               ⅛                             1.66  .0653\r\n               ¼                             2.09  .0823\r\n               ½                             2.65  .1043\r\n               ¾                             2.99  .1187\r\n               1                             3.32  .1307\r\n               1¼                            3.60  .1417\r\n               1½                            3.80  .1496\r\n               1¾                            3.98  .1567\r\n               2                             4.18  .1645\r\n               2¼                            4.32  .1701\r\n               2½                            4.47  .1759\r\n               2¾                            4.63  .1823\r\n               3                             4.80  .1889\r\n               3¼                            4.88  .1921\r\n               3½                            5.01  .1972\r\n               3¾                            5.17  .2035\r\n               4                             5.23  .2058\r\n               4¼                            5.44  .2141\r\n               5                             5.65  .2224\r\n               5½                            5.86  .2283\r\n               6                             6.03  .2374\r\n               6½                            6.20  .2442\r\n               7                             6.36  .2504\r\n               8                             6.64  .2614\r\n               9                             6.90  .2716\r\n               10                            7.15  .2815\r\n               11                            7.38  .2905\r\n               12                            7.60  .2992\r\n               13                            7.81  .3074\r\n               14                            8.00  .3149\r\n               15                            8.18  .3220\r\n               16                            8.36  .3291\r\n               17                            8.53  .3358\r\n               18                            8.70  .3425\r\n               19                            8.86  .3488\r\n               20                            9.01  .3547\r\n               25                            9.71  .3823\r\n               30                           10.31  .4059\r\n               35                           10.86  .4275\r\n               40                           11.35  .4468\r\n               45                           11.82  .4653\r\n               50                           12.23  .4815\r\n               60                           13.00  .5118\r\n               70                           13.38  .5386\r\n               80                           14.30  .5630\r\n               90                           14.89  .5862\r\n               100                          15.42  .6071\r\n               125                          16.60  .6535\r\n               150                          17.63  .6941\r\n               200                          19.41  .7641\r\n               300                          22.22  .8748\r\n               400                          24.46  .9630\r\n               500                          26.35 1.0374\r\n\r\nThe new and finer analytical balances weigh to the tenth part of a\r\nmilligram, the two thousandth part of a carat, the five hundredth part\r\nof a grain; but this is not necessary. If the 200–milligram carat were\r\nused, the two hundredth part of a carat could readily be ascertained,\r\nand then a short-beam, rapid-weighing balance would answer every purpose\r\nand save much time for the dealer who must make many weighings in the\r\ncourse of a day. In an office where thousands of weighings were made in\r\na month, the task was accomplished with such minute accuracy that the\r\nmargin of error did not exceed one carat during that time.\r\n\r\nThe _mina_, the sixtieth part of the lesser Alexandrian talent of\r\nsilver, was divided by the Romans, when they occupied Egypt, into twelve\r\nounces (_unciae_), and, weighing as it did 5460 grains, it became the\r\npredecessor of the European pounds of which the troy pound is a type. If\r\nwe may believe a Syrian authority, Anania of Shiraz, who wrote in the\r\nsixth century, the carat or diamond weight was originally formed from\r\none of these ounces by taking the 1⁄144 part.[380]\r\n\r\nWe find in Murray[381] that the Greek κεράτιον was originally identical\r\nwith the Latin siliqua, and was called the _siliqua Graeca_. As a\r\nmeasure of weight and fineness the carat represents the Roman siliqua as\r\n1⁄24 of the golden solidus of Constantine, which was ⅙ of an ounce,\r\nhence the various values into which 1⁄24 and 1⁄144 enter, or originally\r\nentered. As a measure of weight for diamonds and precious stones, it was\r\noriginally 1⁄144 of an ounce or 3⅓ grains. It is stated in Hakluyt (Voy.\r\nII, pp. 1, 225, 1598): “Those pearls are praised according to the\r\ncaracts which they weigh; every caract is four graines.”\r\n\r\nThere have been at all times men who possessed a delicate touch or a\r\nfine sense of feeling, but probably few men are living to-day who would\r\nbe able to accomplish the feat attributed to Julius Cæsar, namely, that\r\nof estimating the weight of a pearl by simply holding it in his hand.\r\nThere are very few who can tell the weight of a pearl in this way, and\r\nwhile the story may be historically interesting, it is rather dubious.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to formulate a list of prices, comparative or otherwise, of\r\npearls, is almost an impossibility, as probably no two authors of the\r\npast three centuries have ever seen the same lot of pearls, nor have\r\ntheir estimates always been the same as to quality, rarity and value.\r\n\r\nAs interesting statistics from an historical point of view, there will\r\nbe presented here a list of the values of pearls dating back some ten\r\ncenturies. That there always has existed a higher valuation for the\r\nlarger pearls, which are the rarest, will readily be apparent, but that\r\nthe correct value of a pearl of one, ten, twenty or fifty grains be\r\ndefinitely given for the years 1602, 1702, 1802, or 1902 is an\r\nimpossibility. However, we believe this to be the first attempt to\r\npresent so large a body of carefully selected quotations, and they are\r\ngiven to the reader, whether he be layman or professional, for what they\r\nare worth.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the smaller pearls, as is the case with the smaller\r\ndiamonds, prices have been dependent upon the changes of fashion; that\r\nis, whether the prevailing style of jewelry was such that the smaller\r\npearl or diamond was in demand. In other words, if they were used as a\r\ndecoration forming a border, a flower, a scroll ornament, or a pave\r\nrequiring many small gems, the demand naturally increased and the prices\r\nwere higher or lower as the occasion required.\r\n\r\nIt is not the project of this book to fix the prices of pearls at the\r\npresent time, for any such attempt would prove misleading, owing to the\r\nfact that pearls vary in the estimation of the different dealers, and a\r\nfigure given here for the highest standard, if applied to an inferior\r\ngrade, would necessarily mislead the buyer to his positive injury. This\r\nmuch, however, can be said: during the year 1907 pearls from five grains\r\nupward have been sold according to their quality, at a base of five,\r\neight, ten, fifteen, or even twenty dollars in very exceptional cases;\r\nthat is to say, twenty, thirty-two, forty, sixty, or eighty shillings,\r\nor twenty-five, forty, fifty, seventy-five or one hundred francs.\r\nNevertheless, it would be impossible, without considerable experience,\r\nfor a layman to apply these valuations to objects that require much\r\npractice in determining their quality and perfection.\r\n\r\nWith diamonds, rubies, and emeralds there may be a stated price per\r\ncarat for stones of a certain size, but a gem of unusual perfection or\r\nbrilliancy, or of exceptionally fine color, will often command a price\r\nfar beyond that generally quoted. It is the same with the pearl. Sums\r\nwhich may seem exorbitant in comparison with those that are paid for\r\nordinary pearls, are often given for specimens remarkable for their\r\nbeauty, size, or luster.\r\n\r\nPearls of one hundred grains are even more rare at the present time than\r\nare diamonds of one hundred carats. Until the middle of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, the diamonds of the world weighing one hundred carats or over\r\ncould be counted on the fingers, but since the opening of the African\r\nmines in 1870, the number of large diamonds has increased at a much\r\ngreater ratio than have the pearls of one quarter of their weight. It\r\nwould thus seem that pearls of great size are worth four times as much\r\nas diamonds of equal weight. For instance, a 100–carat diamond of the\r\nfinest quality would be worth at least from $1000 to $1500 a carat,\r\nmaking a total value of $100,000 to $150,000; and a pearl of 100 grains\r\nat a base of $10 would be worth $100,000. But no such high price has\r\never been paid.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of estimating the value of pearls is by establishing a\r\nbase value for those weighing one grain and then multiplying this amount\r\nby the square of the number of grains that the pearl weighs. For\r\ninstance, if the base value of a one-grain pearl should be fixed at $1,\r\na pearl weighing two grains would be worth $4 (2 × 2 = 4), or $2 per\r\ngrain; one weighing five grains would be worth $25, or $5 per grain,\r\netc. Naturally, these values increase in proportion to the increase in\r\nthe value of the base. A base of $3 would give a value of $75 for a\r\nfive-grain pearl, or $15 per grain, while a $10 base would make the\r\nvalue $50 per grain, or $250.\r\n\r\nThis method of estimating pearls by squaring their weights has been\r\ncredited by many authors to David Jeffries, who published an interesting\r\ntreatise on diamonds and pearls in 1750–1753. It has also been credited\r\nto Tavernier, the oriental traveler of the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. We have, however, traced this method back to Anselmus de Boot,\r\nin his treatise on precious stones, dated 1609. Before this date we have\r\nnot been able to find any mention of the computation of the value of\r\ndiamonds and pearls by squaring their weight and multiplying the product\r\nby a base of a franc, guilder, crown, dollar, or of many dollars, as\r\nwould be necessary at present. It is probable, however, that this system\r\nis of oriental origin and it may have come to Europe through some of the\r\noriental traders, with the precious stones, as did the use of the carat.\r\n\r\nDe Boot makes the carat (four grains) his unit of comparison, increasing\r\nhis base value by one third for pearls weighing eleven carats\r\n(forty-four grains) or over. In Pio Naldi’s treatise, published in\r\nBologna in 1791, the unit is the grain, the base being the fourth part\r\nof the value of four pearls weighing together one carat. Naldi, also,\r\nincreases his base value making it 1½ lire ($.30) for pearls weighing\r\nless than ten grains, and 2½ lire ($.50) for those weighing twenty\r\ngrains and upward.\r\n\r\nA curious method of valuing pearls by their weight is shown in a\r\ntreatise by Buteo, published in 1554.[382] The writer states that a\r\npearl weighing two carats was valued at 5 gold crowns; one of four\r\ncarats at 25 crowns; and so on, the price increasing fivefold when the\r\nweight was doubled. The intermediate figures were obtained by computing\r\nthe proportional mean of any two known weights and values. For example:\r\n8 × 4 = 32, the square root of which is 5.656. Now, the value of a\r\nfour-carat pearl is 25 and that of an eight-carat pearl 125 crowns, and\r\n125 × 25 = 3125, the square root being 55.9; hence a pearl weighing\r\n5.656 carats was worth 55.9 crowns.\r\n\r\nThe base value of a necklace can be determined in the following way.\r\nShould the center pearl weigh 25 grains, multiply 25 by 25; the result\r\nis 625; then, take the next two, three, or four pearls, as many as are\r\nof approximately the same weight, add their weights together, multiply\r\nthe resulting figure by itself and divide the product by the number of\r\npearls in the group. Proceed in exactly the same way with the remainder\r\nof the necklace, always grouping the pearls so that there shall not be a\r\nconsiderable difference in weight between the smallest and the largest\r\npearl, and then add together the figures obtained for the center pearl\r\nand for the various groups and divide the price of the necklace by this\r\ntotal; the quotient will represent the multiple or base.\r\n\r\nAs may be seen by comparison of the first with the second and third of\r\nthe accompanying tables, the result arrived at in this way will, if\r\nthere is any difference in the weight of the pearls in the various\r\ngroups, vary slightly from that obtained by calculating the weight of\r\neach pearl separately, but it represents a satisfactory approximation.\r\n\r\n             NECKLACE OF 41 GRADUATED PEARLS ON A $10 BASE\r\n\r\n     1 pearl, weighing 25  grs. 25  × 25  =                 625.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 22  grs. 44  × 44  = 1936      ÷ 2 = 968.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 20  grs. 40  × 40  = 1600      ÷ 2 = 800.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 19  grs. 38  × 38  = 1444      ÷ 2 = 722.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 18  grs. 36  × 36  = 1296      ÷ 2 = 648.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 17½ grs. 35  × 35  = 1225      ÷ 2 = 612.500\r\n     2 pearls, each of 17  grs. 34  × 34  = 1156      ÷ 2 = 578.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 16½ grs. 33  × 33  = 1089      ÷ 2 = 544.500\r\n     2 pearls, each of 16  grs. 32  × 32  = 1024      ÷ 2 = 512.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 15½ grs. 31  × 31  = 961       ÷ 2 = 480.500\r\n     2 pearls, each of 15  grs. 30  × 30  = 900       ÷ 2 = 450.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 14½ grs. 29  × 29  = 841       ÷ 2 = 420.500\r\n     2 pearls, each of 14  grs. 28  × 28  = 784       ÷ 2 = 392.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 13½ grs. 27  × 27  = 729       ÷ 2 = 364.500\r\n     2 pearls, each of 13  grs. 26  × 26  = 676       ÷ 2 = 338.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 12½ grs. 25  × 25  = 625       ÷ 2 = 312.500\r\n     2 pearls, each of 12  grs. 24  × 24  = 576       ÷ 2 = 288.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 11½ grs. 23  × 23  = 529       ÷ 2 = 264.500\r\n     2 pearls, each of 11  grs. 22  × 22  = 484       ÷ 2 = 242.000\r\n     2 pearls, each of 10¾ grs. 21½ × 21½ = 462¼      ÷ 2 = 231.125\r\n     2 pearls, each of 10¼ grs. 20½ × 20½ = 420¼      ÷ 2 = 210.125\r\n    ——                          ———                      ——————————\r\n    41                          624                      10,003.750\r\n                     $10 × 10,003.75 = $100,037.50\r\n\r\n                  THE SAME NECKLACE FIGURED IN GROUPS\r\n\r\n      1 pearl, weighing       25 grs. 25 × 25 =             625.00\r\n      2 pearls, total weight  44 grs. 44 × 44 = 1936 ÷ 2 =  968.00\r\n      4 pearls, total weight  78 grs. 78 × 78 = 6084 ÷ 4 = 1521.00\r\n      4 pearls, total weight  71 grs. 71 × 71 = 5041 ÷ 4 = 1260.25\r\n      6 pearls, total weight  99 grs. 99 × 99 = 9801 ÷ 6 = 1633.50\r\n      6 pearls, total weight  90 grs. 90 × 90 = 8100 ÷ 6 = 1350.00\r\n      6 pearls, total weight  81 grs. 81 × 81 = 6561 ÷ 6 = 1093.50\r\n      6 pearls, total weight  72 grs. 72 × 72 = 5184 ÷ 6 =  864.00\r\n      6 pearls, total weight  64 grs. 64 × 64 = 4096 ÷ 6 =  682.67\r\n                             ———                           ———————\r\n                             624                           9997.92\r\n                       $10 × 9997.92 = $99,979.20\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GREAT PEARL NECKLACE OF THE FRENCH CROWN JEWELS\r\n\r\n  Composed of 362 pearls, weighing 58.8 grains.

The different grouping of the pearls\r\naccounts for the slight reduction in value.\r\n\r\nA system of estimating the value of pearls which has recently been\r\nintroduced into Germany, is an adaptation of the ordinary method of\r\nsquaring the number of grains and then multiplying the result by a\r\ncertain base figure. The pearls are first grouped according to quality\r\nand size, and a figure is agreed upon as the multiplicator of each\r\nclass. In Germany the carat is employed as the weight unit for pearls as\r\nwell as for diamonds, and in this new system the total weight of a given\r\nnumber of pearls of the same class is first reduced to grains; the\r\nnumber of grains is then multiplied by four and the quotient is\r\nmultiplied by the figure agreed upon. The resulting sum, after being\r\ndivided by the number of pearls, gives the carat value of such pearls.\r\nFor example, if the base figure agreed upon is 5, and we wish to find\r\nthe carat worth of 4 pearls of similar size, weighing together 3–14⁄64\r\ncarats, the sum would be as follows:\r\n\r\n                        206 × 4 × 4 × 5\r\n                        ——————————————— = 64.37\r\n                            64 × 4\r\n\r\nAt this rate per carat, reckoning in marks, the value of the 3–14⁄64\r\ncarats would be 207.20 marks. This result is identical with that\r\nobtained by the ordinary method, but the calculation is perhaps a trifle\r\nsimplified.[383]\r\n\r\nA curious Hindu treatise on gems has been preserved for us in the\r\nBrhatsamhitâ of Varâhamihira (505–587 A.D.). It is the earliest work of\r\nthis kind that we have in Sanskrit, and M. Louis Finot,[384] who has\r\npublished it, together with several other similar treatises, believes\r\nthat it was based upon an original composed at a much earlier period. In\r\nhis introduction M. Finot says: “It would be an error to regard the\r\nratnaçastra [treatise on gems] as a simple manual for the use of\r\njewelers. Without doubt this subject formed one of the principal\r\nbranches of commercial instruction, ... but it was also taught to\r\nprinces and it is for their use that the ratnaçastras we publish seem to\r\nhave been composed.”\r\n\r\nThis treatise only describes four gems, although a larger number are\r\nenumerated. These gems are the diamond, the pearl, the ruby, and the\r\nemerald. One of the most interesting portions is that treating of the\r\nvaluation of pearls. The system described is peculiar, and,\r\nunfortunately, there is some difficulty in finding an absolutely correct\r\nequivalent for the values expressed.\r\n\r\nA price is first placed upon a pearl weighing 4 mâsakas (about 45\r\ngrains). This is estimated at 5300 kârsâpanas (about $1600). As the\r\nweight diminishes the valuation decreases as follows:\r\n\r\n                     4  mâsakas     5300 kârsâpanas\r\n                     3½ mâsakas     3200 kârsâpanas\r\n                     3  mâsakas     2000 kârsâpanas\r\n                     2½ mâsakas     1300 kârsâpanas\r\n                     2  mâsakas      800 kârsâpanas\r\n                     1½ mâsakas      353 kârsâpanas\r\n                     1  mâsakas      135 kârsâpanas\r\n                     4  guñjas[385]   90 kârsâpanas\r\n                     3  guñjas        50 kârsâpanas\r\n                     2½ guñjas        35 kârsâpanas\r\n\r\nSmaller pearls were grouped together in dharanas (one dharana = about 72\r\ngrains). If there were thirteen fine pearls in a dharana, they were\r\nvalued at 325 rûpakas (about $100); the other values were as follows:\r\n\r\n               16 pearls in a dharana were worth 200 rûpakas\r\n               20 pearls in a dharana were worth 170 rûpakas\r\n               25 pearls in a dharana were worth 130 rûpakas\r\n               30 pearls in a dharana were worth  70 rûpakas\r\n               40 pearls in a dharana were worth  50 rûpakas\r\n            55–60 pearls in a dharana were worth  40 rûpakas\r\n               80 pearls in a dharana were worth  30 rûpakas\r\n              100 pearls in a dharana were worth  25 rûpakas\r\n              200 pearls in a dharana were worth  12 rûpakas\r\n              300 pearls in a dharana were worth   6 rûpakas\r\n              400 pearls in a dharana were worth   5 rûpakas\r\n              500 pearls in a dharana were worth   3 rûpakas\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely interesting if we could find at this early date\r\n(sixth century A.D.) an indication of the use of the system of computing\r\nthe value of pearls by the square of their weight as expressed in some\r\nweight unit, and it is singular that the three valuations given for the\r\nweight in guñjas are graduated in accordance with this system. A pearl\r\nweighing 2½ guñjas and valued at 35 kârṣapâṇas would have a base value\r\nof 5.6 kârṣâpaṇas. Estimated at this ratio we would have the following\r\nfigures:\r\n\r\n                        3 guñjas 50.4 kârṣâpaṇas\r\n                        4 guñjas 89.6 kârṣâpaṇas\r\n\r\nNow, the values actually given are 50 and 90 kârṣâpaṇas, respectively,\r\nand these figures are easily obtained by rejecting the fraction that is\r\nless than one half and counting the fraction that is in excess of one\r\nhalf as a unit. After this, however, the progression becomes irregular.\r\nA pearl weighing 1 mâṣaka (5 guñjas) is valued at 135 kârṣâpaṇas, while\r\nthe equivalent according to the system would be 140. However, it is\r\npossible that the writer may have changed this figure intentionally so\r\nas to add exactly one half to the preceding valuation (90 + 45 = 135).\r\nThe succeeding values bear no relation to the system and appear to be\r\nentirely arbitrary. Still, it can scarcely be due to hazard that the\r\nfirst three figures are practically in exact accord with the system and\r\nthe fourth in close approximation. As the change seems to come when the\r\nweight is expressed in mâṣakas instead of guñjas, we are tempted to\r\nthink that the system may have been used for single pearls weighing less\r\nthan twelve grains (1 mâṣaka = 11¼ grains), while the value of those\r\nover that weight was estimated in a different way.\r\n\r\nIn a much later Hindu treatise, by Buddhabhatta, after certain values\r\nhave been given for pearls of the best quality, a pearl of this class is\r\ndescribed as follows:\r\n\r\n  White, round, heavy, smooth, luminous, spotless, the pearl gifted\r\n  with these qualities is called qualified (_guṇavat_). If it be\r\n  yellow, it is worth half this price; if it be not round, a third; if\r\n  flat or triangular, a sixth.[386]\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest records we have of a system of prices for pearls is\r\nthe treatise on precious stones written in the year 1265, by Ahmed ibn\r\nYusuf al Teifashi, who was probably a native jeweler of Egypt. In his\r\ntime pearls were sold in Bagdad in bunches of ten strings, each string\r\ncomprising thirty-six pearls. If one of these strings weighed one sixth\r\nof a miskal (four carats or sixteen grains), the ten strings were valued\r\nat four dinars (about ten dollars). The values increased progressively\r\nas follows:[387]\r\n\r\n Average weight  10 strings of 36 pearls,              Value\r\n of each pearl     weight of each string\r\n\r\n     Grains        Carats        Grains        Dinars      U.

When a pearl possesses these requisites and weighs one\r\nmiskal [24 carats or 96 grains] it is worth 300 dinars [$750]. If,\r\nhowever, a match is found for this pearl and each one weighs one miskal\r\nand has the same form, the two pearls together cost 700 dinars [$1750].”\r\nThis writer also mentions that in the shops of the Arab jewelers, the\r\npearl which exceeded the weight of a drachma (12 carats or 48 grains)\r\neven by one grain, was called _dorra_, while the name _johar_ was used\r\nfor that which did not reach the above weight.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, Feuchtwanger gave the price of a one-carat pearl as five\r\ndollars, and used this amount as the multiplier of the square of the\r\nweight; therefore, a four-carat pearl would cost four times four\r\nmultiplied by five dollars, the value of the first carat; that is to\r\nsay, a sixteen-grain (four-carat) pearl would have been worth eighty\r\ndollars in 1838, according to this computation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE SIAMESE PRINCE IN FULL REGALIA\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1858, Barbot[388] gave the value of pearls under ordinary conditions,\r\nbut very indefinitely, as follows:\r\n\r\n             Grains Carats Francs per carat U.

Seed-pearls, if\r\nquite round, were worth about 120 francs per ounce.\r\n\r\nEmanuel[389] gave the following table of prices for the pearl, reduced\r\nto United States currency:\r\n\r\n                   Grains     1865          1867\r\n\r\n                        3  $2.88— $3.84  $4.32— $4.80\r\n                        4   5.28—  6.72   6.72—  8.40\r\n                        5   8.40— 10.80   9.60— 12.00\r\n                        6  13.20— 15.60  16.80— 19.20\r\n                        8  21.60— 26.40  24.00— 28.80\r\n                       10  38.40— 43.20  48.00— 52.80\r\n                       12  57.60— 72.00  67.20— 76.80\r\n                       14  72.00— 86.40  86.40— 96.00\r\n                       16  96.00—144.00  96.00—144.00\r\n                       18 144.00—192.00 144.00—192.00\r\n                       20 192.00—240.00 192.00—240.00\r\n                       24 288.00—345.60 288.00—345.60\r\n                       30 384.00—480.00 384.00—480.00\r\n\r\nThe following values appear in the “Encyclopedia Hispano-Americana,”\r\nBarcelona, 1894, Vol. XV, p. 180 (Louis Dieulafait):\r\n\r\n      Grains        Value, 1865                Value, 1867\r\n               Pesetas   U.

As the carat value of four such pearls is given as five lire and\r\n576 one-grain pearls were counted as one ounce, these two numbers were\r\nused to determine the value of an ounce of small pearls. The product of\r\n576 multiplied by 5 is 2880, and this number was then divided by 2000,\r\n1000, 500, or whatever might be the number of pearls in a given ounce.\r\nIf there were 2000 pearls, the carat value would be 1.44 lire or $.29;\r\nif there were 1000, the carat would be worth 2.88 lire or $.57; if 500,\r\n5.76 lire or $1.15, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HALF-PEARLS: LOTS OF THREE DIFFERENT SIZES.\r\n\r\n  BROOCH OF HALF-PEARLS AND ONYX. UNITED STATES, 1860\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe same author[398] gives tables expressing the values of pearls not\r\nperfectly spherical in form, which he designates as “perle dolce.” These\r\npearls he considers to be worth half the price of good round pearls;\r\nthat is to say, 2½ lire (about $.50) per carat for four weighing\r\ntogether one carat. Where there are as many as three thousand of these\r\n“perle dolce” in an ounce, the 2½ lire base is multiplied by 576, the\r\nnumber of grains given to the ounce; this makes the value of an ounce of\r\none-grain pearls $288. This amount is then divided by 3000, and the\r\nquotient, $.096, represents the value of one carat of these small\r\npearls. Multiplying this by 144 we obtain, as the value of an ounce of\r\nsuch pearls, $13.82. An ounce consisting of two thousand would be worth\r\n$20.73, while if there were but one hundred to the ounce it would be\r\nvalued at $414.72, or $4.15 for each pearl and $.72 per grain of weight.\r\nIn this latter case the pearls would average 5¾ grains. Another class of\r\npearls denominated by this author as “scaramazzi,” pearls of an\r\nirregular form and with protuberances, are estimated in a similar way,\r\nbut at exactly half of the above values. The baroque pearls were not\r\nconsidered to be worth even half as much as the “scaramazzi.”\r\n\r\nScotch pearls (fresh-water) are mentioned by De Boot (1609, p. 88 _sq._)\r\namong the other western pearls—Bohemian, etc. He remarks that they were\r\nvalued much less than the oriental pearls, but if they were of\r\nespecially pure color their value was greater, although they lacked the\r\nsilvery hue characteristic of the eastern pearl. Fine pearls of this\r\nsort were valued on a carat base of one fourth of a thaler ($.27), so\r\nthat a forty-grain pearl was worth $27, and one of eighty grains, $108.\r\nThe author of the Bologna treatise, “Delle Gemme,” 1791, attributes the\r\nlack of luster in the Scotch pearls to the presence of a dark mass in\r\nthe interior which interfered with the passage of light. He estimates\r\nScotch pearls to be worth one half the value of oriental pearls of\r\nmediocre quality, provided the former are fairly good.\r\n\r\nA Scotch writer of the seventeenth century is more enthusiastic in\r\nregard to these pearls; he mentions having paid one hundred rix dollars\r\nfor an exceptionally fine one, but he does not specify its weight. This\r\nis the value given by De Boot for a pearl of this class weighing eighty\r\ngrains, as we have just mentioned. The Scotch writer asserts that he\r\ncould never sell a necklace of fine Scotch pearls in Scotland itself, as\r\nevery one wanted oriental pearls; he continues: “At this very day I can\r\nshow some of our own Scots Pearls as fine, more hard and transparent\r\nthan any Oriental. It is true that the Oriental can be easier matched,\r\nbecause they are all of a yellow water, yet foreigners covet Scots\r\nPearls.”\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon[399] and India, pearl-grading and valuing has received close\r\nattention, and an elaborate system has been evolved by the pearl\r\nmerchants. This system has been in use for generations and possibly for\r\ncenturies. Although apparently very complicated, it is in reality quite\r\nsimple, if we only remember that the value of inferior pearls is\r\ndetermined by their weight, whereas the value of superior pearls is\r\ncomputed from the square of their weight.\r\n\r\nThe pearls are first grouped according to the size, of which ten grades\r\nare made. This is done by passing them successively through ten brass\r\nsaucer-like sieves or baskets (_peddi_), each about three and a half\r\ninches in diameter and one inch deep. The holes in the bottom of each\r\nsieve are of uniform size, but they are graduated in size for the\r\ndifferent baskets. The pearls are sifted in the basket with the largest\r\nholes, and those which will not pass through are of the first size. The\r\npearls which pass through are then sifted in the second basket, and\r\nthose retained are of the second size; and so on through the entire\r\nseries of ten sieves or baskets. Those which pass through the tenth\r\nsieve are known as _masi-túl_, or powder pearls; they are of little\r\nvalue owing to their very small size, and are not subject to further\r\nclassification. Of course, the attached pearls or very irregular\r\nbaroques—the _oddumuttu_—are not subject to the sifting process, and are\r\nvalued independently of this.\r\n\r\nSometimes in India, as well as in western countries, false measures are\r\nused, and an oriental pearl merchant may have one set of sieves for use\r\nin buying and another for selling. The rule for determining the proper\r\nsize of the holes in the first sieve is that they may pass pearls\r\nweighing 20 to the _kalan̄chǔ_, whence this sieve is commonly known as\r\nthe “20 _peddi_.” The second sieve is the “30 _peddi_,” since it passes\r\npearls weighing 30 to the _kalan̄chǔ_. In the proper order the other\r\nsieves respectively pass pearls requiring 50, 80, 100, 200, 400, 600,\r\n800, and 1000 to the _kalan̄chǔ_.\r\n\r\nThis use of sieves for grading the Ceylon pearls was mentioned by\r\nCleandro Arnobio, a writer of the latter part of the sixteenth century,\r\nin his “Tesoro delle Gioie,” and he took his description from an older\r\nwriter, Garzia dell’ Horto.\r\n\r\nAfter the sifting, each of the ten graded lots of pearls are placed on\r\npieces of cloth for classification as to quality, shape, and luster.\r\nThis classification requires much skill and judgment on the part of the\r\nvaluer. Not only will two persons commonly fail to class a large lot of\r\npearls exactly alike, but one person is not likely to class the same lot\r\ntwice in precisely the same manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A.

Oriental pearls.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFrom long established custom, recognition is made of twelve classes into\r\nwhich the ten grades or sizes of pearls are divided with respect to\r\nshape and luster, the local names of these classes giving a fair\r\nindication of their respective characteristics. These names are:\r\n\r\n   1 _Ani_, “best”: perfect in sphericity and luster, the true orient\r\n       pearl.\r\n\r\n   2 _Anatári_, “follower”: failing slightly in sphericity and luster.\r\n\r\n   3 _Masanku_ or _Masaku_: badly colored pearls, usually gray,\r\n       symmetrical, and with luster.\r\n\r\n   4 _Kaiyéral_, “the clasp of a necklace”: a dark-colored treble pearl,\r\n       not quite round.\r\n\r\n   5 _Machchakai._\r\n\r\n   6 _Vadivu_, “beauty,” also “decreasing”: that which is strained or\r\n       sifted; found in the 100, 200, and 400 sieves. These small\r\n       pearls, regular in shape, and of good luster, are especially\r\n       favored in the East.\r\n\r\n   7 _Madanku_, “folded,” or “bent”: all pearls of _vadivu_ size that\r\n       are imperfect in form or color.\r\n\r\n   8 _Kǔrǔval_, “short”: deformed and double pearls; they may, however,\r\n       be of excellent luster. _Ani Kǔrǔval_: where two _áni_ are fused\r\n       together, but so formed that if separate they would be perfectly\r\n       spherical. _Písal Kǔrǔval_: where several pearls of good luster\r\n       and color are fused partially and irregularly together. _Pampara\r\n       Kǔrǔval_: a pearl grooved regularly, like a top.\r\n\r\n   9 _Kalippu_, “abundance,” or “rejected”: inferior to _Anatári_; a\r\n       good pearl, may be lens-shaped or elongated; usually flattened.\r\n\r\n  10 _Písal_, “torn”: a deformed pearl or cluster of small misshapen\r\n       pearls; of poor color and of little value.\r\n\r\n  11 _Kurál_: very misshapen and small.\r\n\r\n  12 _Túl_, “powder”: the seed-pearls, those retained by the 600, 800,\r\n       and 1000 sieves.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above designations, the following are also used:\r\n\r\n  _Samadiam_: a pearl of a reddish hue; pear-shaped but of dull color.\r\n\r\n  _Nimelai_: a nose-pearl, perfect skinned, and pear- or egg-shaped.\r\n\r\n  _Sirippu_: a pearl grooved with irregular wrinkle-like furrows.\r\n\r\n  _Kodai_, “brown”: like a nut, with no nacreous luster; formed of\r\n    prismatic shell; may be large, is usually spherical, and includes\r\n    pearls of various colors. This name is also used for white pearls\r\n    with black or brown marks. _Van Kodai_: a _kodai_ pearl with one\r\n    side nacreous. _Karunk Kodai_: a black or blue-black slag-like\r\n    pearl.\r\n\r\n  _Masi-túl_, “ink-dust,” or “chalk-powder”: smaller than the 1000\r\n    sieve. Generally used for medicinal purposes, or burnt and eaten\r\n    with areca-nut and betel by the natives.\r\n\r\n  _Oddu_—or _Ottumuttu_, “shell-pearl”: an attached pearl or nacreous\r\n    excrescence on the outside of the shell.\r\n\r\nOf the twelve classes named above, the first four are known as the\r\n_chevvǔ_, or superior classes; the next three as the _vadivu_, or\r\nbeautiful classes; and the last five as the _kalan̄chǔ_, or inferior\r\nclasses. The _chevvǔ_ pearls are found only in the first four sieves or\r\nbaskets; and for this reason these are known as the _chevvǔ peddi_ or\r\n“chevvǔ baskets,” although they may also retain inferior pearls. A name\r\nused to indicate the class of pearls found in the first four sieves is\r\n_mel_ or _melmuttu_, “upper” or “superior pearl,” while _vadivu_\r\ndesignates those retained by the next three and _túl_ those of the last\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nAfter the pearls have been graded according to size and classified\r\naccording to quality, they are weighed. The unit of weight is the\r\n_manchádi_, the seed of _Abrus precatorius_, a small, red berry of\r\npractically uniform weight when ripe. H. W. Gillman of the Ceylon Civil\r\nService reports the weight of the _man̄chádi_ to be 3.35 grains troy.\r\nFractional parts of a unit are obtained by using a berry called\r\n_kundumani_, grains of rice, etc., whose weights have been determined\r\nbeforehand. A brass weight—the _kalan̄chǔ_—is also employed; it equals\r\n67 grains or 20 _man̄chádi_.\r\n\r\nHowever, choice pearls—those of the superior classes—are not valued in\r\nthis manner, but at so much per _chevvǔ_ of their weight, which is three\r\nfourths of the square of the weight in _man̄chádi_. Thus, to find the\r\nvalue of an _anatári_ pearl in the second sieve, if the weight be found\r\nto be three _man̄chádi_, three fourths of the square of three, or 6¾, is\r\nmultiplied by the base value of the _anatári_ class.\r\n\r\nThe actual process of the calculation of value is as follows: owing to\r\nthe small size of the pearls, many fractions enter into the\r\ncomputations; to preserve uniformity it is customary to increase all\r\nfractions so that each may have 320 as a denominator, this being a\r\ncommon multiple of those that ordinarily arise in _chevvǔ_ calculations.\r\nThe weight in _man̄chádi_ of the pearls is increased to a fractional\r\nfigure having 320 as a denominator. Three fourths of the square of the\r\nnumerator of this fraction is divided by the number of pearls, and this\r\nquotient is divided twice consecutively by 320, giving the _chevvǔ_ of\r\nthe weight. The market value then follows from the quoted price of the\r\npearls per _chevvǔ_ at the time.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice, these computations are not made; but each merchant\r\nprovides himself with sets of tables showing the calculations for\r\ndifferent weights, analogous to the use of interest tables by bankers,\r\nor of tables of logarithms by surveyors. Some of the merchants commit\r\nthese tables to memory, and at times may be heard reciting them quietly\r\nto themselves to refresh the memory.\r\n\r\nIf a pearl of a particular grade and class is of exceptional merit, the\r\nmerchant adds somewhat to the money value computed by the above process.\r\nThis applies especially to double pearls of the _kǔrǔval_ class, which\r\nsometimes consist of two fine bouton pearls suitable for setting, but\r\nnot for stringing.\r\n\r\nPearls of one of the inferior or _kalan̄chǔ_ classes are valued by\r\nsimple weight, at so much per _kalan̄chǔ_, the market price, of course,\r\ndiffering for pearls of the various classes. The weight having been\r\nascertained, each in its class as before noted, the value is determined\r\nby multiplying that weight by the current market price per unit of such\r\npearls, at so many rupees per _kalan̄chǔ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NECKLACE CONTAINING 126,000 SEED-PEARLS. LOUIS XVI PERIOD\r\n\r\n  Property of an American lady\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe star pagoda is used in calculating the values. This small gold coin\r\nwas current in south India in the early part of the last century. In the\r\ncomputations it is considered to be worth three and a half rupees,\r\nalthough its intrinsic value as a gold coin is about six rupees.\r\n\r\nIt is considered probable that the London syndicate,[400] which has\r\nlately leased the Ceylon pearl fisheries for a period of twenty years,\r\nwill do away with the complicated calculations employed for so many\r\ngenerations, surviving all changes of administration, Portuguese, Dutch,\r\nand British. This is only one of the many instances showing the tendency\r\nof the British Government to abolish time-honored usages in India,\r\nwithout regard to the wishes of its population; and, unimportant as many\r\nof these changes may seem to us, they all serve to foster a spirit of\r\ndiscontent that may lead to serious trouble. This conduct on the part of\r\nGreat Britain is all the stranger in view of the stubborn opposition of\r\nthat country to the adoption of the scientific and logical metric\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIn Bombay, the weight of pearls in tanks is made the basis of their\r\nvaluation; the tank equals 24 ratti or about 72 grains troy. The square\r\nof the number of tanks is multiplied by 330 and the quotient divided by\r\nthe number of pearls; this gives the number of _chevvǔs_, or _chows_, as\r\nthey are sometimes called, and the market price of the _chevvǔs_ for a\r\ngiven class of pearls shows their value. If, for instance, we have 56\r\npearls of a certain quality, weighing 5 tanks, and the _chevvǔs_ of\r\nthese pearls is worth 14 rupees, the sum would be as follows:\r\n\r\n            5 × 5 × 330 × 14\r\n            ———————————————— = 2062.5 rupees, or about $825.\r\n                   56\r\n\r\nIn this case, as in the other system of weighing which we have\r\nmentioned, the _chevvǔs_ is only a nominal weight; but there is in India\r\na real weight unit which bears this name.[401]\r\n\r\nThe high esteem in which the pearl was held by the Hindus is well\r\nillustrated by the following statement from an old treatise on gems: “A\r\npearl weighing two kalan̄jas (about 180 grains) should not be worn even\r\nby kings. It is for the gods, it is without equal.”[402]\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of a great savant’s experience, in the early part\r\nof the sixteenth century, regarding the value of pearls, is given by\r\nGuillaume Budé[403] (1467–1540), the celebrated French Hellenist who\r\nlived during the reign of Francis I and who is regarded as the founder\r\nof the College de France. In his work entitled “De Asse,” he states that\r\nhe once inquired of a gem dealer in Paris whether the latter could\r\nrecall the weight of some remarkable pearl which had passed through his\r\nhands. The dealer replied that he had seen one weighing 30 carats (120\r\ngrains), whereupon another gem dealer, who was present, remarked that he\r\nhad in his possession one of 40 carats (160 grains). This pearl was sold\r\na few days later for 3000 gold crowns ($6750). On another occasion Budé\r\nwas told that a pearl of exquisite beauty weighing 30 carats, had been\r\nsold to the Duchesse de Bourbon, daughter of Louis XI of France, for the\r\nsum of 4000 gold crowns ($9000).\r\n\r\nIn regard to the manner of computing the value of pearls Budé writes: “I\r\nthink the ratio of these prices can be calculated. When I asked a gem\r\ndealer what was the value of a pearl of four carats [sixteen grains],\r\naccording to the formula, he replied: ‘I have seen such a pearl sell for\r\nthirty gold crowns [$67.50].’ Whereupon I asked: ‘How much would you\r\nestimate one weighing eight carats [thirty-two grains]?’ ‘At least two\r\nhundred gold crowns [$450],’ he answered; and as I continued to ply him\r\nwith questions, gradually increasing the weight, he responded in such a\r\nway that I could understand that the increase of the price bore not a\r\nnumerical, but a proportional relation to the weight; so that the above\r\nmentioned eight-carat pearl, having double the weight of a four-carat\r\npearl, was valued at seven times as much. The same was true of a pearl\r\nweighing twelve carats, twenty carats, and so on; the price augmenting\r\nby a greater and greater increment as the weight increased.”\r\n\r\nIn the “Coronae Gemma Noblissima” of Wilhelmus Eo (1621, pp. 32, 33), an\r\ninstance is given of the rapid changes that are possible in the worth of\r\na pearl. A large and beautiful pearl was brought to Nuremberg by a\r\nmerchant who had paid 500 florins for it; he soon found a purchaser\r\namong the merchants there, who was willing to pay him 800 florins. This\r\nlatter merchant in his turn disposed of his gem for 1000 florins, and\r\nshortly after it again changed hands twice, the first time at an advance\r\nof 200 florins and the second at an advance of 300 florins. All this\r\nhappened within a few days. The writer tells us that the last purchaser,\r\nwho paid 1500 florins for the pearl, took it with him to Venice “where\r\nthe wealthy dames wear a great treasure of beautiful pearls as necklaces\r\nupon their bare skin, and he will not have lost anything on his pearl\r\nthere.”\r\n\r\nIn 1884, Mr. Edwin Streeter was asked by a member of a London syndicate\r\nto proceed to the East, to value a large quantity of jewels, as a heavy\r\nsum of money was about to be advanced to a certain Power, to provide the\r\nsinews of war. On his way he was requested to stop at one of the\r\nprincipal towns in Germany to purchase some jewels which had been valued\r\nfor probate but were not easy of sale in that market. The valuation\r\npaper was shown to him, and after examining the ornaments, he agreed to\r\ntake them at the prices named. Among them was an old gold brooch of\r\nRussian manufacture, valued at £4; in the center of this brooch was what\r\nappeared to be a piece of hematite, but was in reality a fine, round,\r\nblack pearl, weighing 77 grains. The color had faded from exposure to\r\nthe sun. This pearl was brought to London, and the outer layer was taken\r\noff, when a perfect black pearl of 67 grains was uncovered. This was\r\nsold to a manufacturing jeweler in London for £400; but, having heard\r\nthat in Paris there was a pearl that would exactly match it, Mr.\r\nStreeter bought it back again for £600, and then sold it at a large\r\nprofit to one of the Paris crown jewelers, who, in his turn, sold the\r\npair to a rich iron merchant for 50,000 francs (£2000 or $10,000). Since\r\nthen the sum of 100,000 francs (£4000 or $20,000) has been refused for\r\nthis pair of matchless black pearls. At present values they may be worth\r\ndouble this sum.\r\n\r\nAt different times the values assigned to the different forms and colors\r\nof pearls have varied. For instance, in the French Encyclopédie of 1774\r\n(Vol. XII, p. 385), it is stated that pear-shaped pearls, although they\r\nmight be equally perfect and of the same weight as round pearls, were\r\nvalued much less than these. Even in the case of well-matched pairs,\r\ntheir price was a third less than that of round pearls.\r\n\r\nAs early as the sixteenth century it was not uncommon that jewelers who\r\nhad in their possession a fine pear-shaped pearl would have a replica of\r\nit molded in lead, and then send the casts to the large cities of Europe\r\nand the East. If a mate was found for it, the respective owners soon\r\ncame to terms, for such pearls command a much higher price together than\r\nthey do separately.\r\n\r\nAn interesting story is told of no less a collector than the Duke of\r\nBrunswick, who was so generous to the city of Geneva. For many years\r\nevery pear-shaped pearl from every land had been submitted to him for\r\nexamination. He always claimed the privilege of examining it alone for a\r\nmoment or two and in every instance he returned it. At last a new\r\npear-shaped pearl of marvelous size and beauty was heard of in a distant\r\ncountry. It was sent to Germany, where the duke was visiting at that\r\ntime, to a local dealer who acted as agent for the owner. The price\r\ndemanded for it seemed excessive, but the duke took the pearl, stepped\r\naside for a moment, and said, quick as a flash, “The pearl is mine.” The\r\nnext day he showed it with a mate he had owned for many years and that\r\nwas a most faultless match. Through all the years of his search he had\r\nnever informed any one of his intention to match the pearl he already\r\nowned.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, at the time of the death of the father of Sultan Buderuddin of\r\nthe Sulu Islands, a box of large and fine pearls was among the treasures\r\nhe left behind him. Many of these disappeared, but some of them came\r\ninto the hands of Sultan Buderuddin and his mother. The former sold\r\nthose which he had inherited, in order to defray the expenses of a\r\npilgrimage to Mecca, in 1882. His mother, who exerted a great influence\r\nover the conduct of affairs, retained a number of the pearls, and it was\r\nalways difficult to induce her to part with any of them. When, as very\r\nrarely happened, she was persuaded to do so, she invariably got a higher\r\nprice for them than they would have commanded in London, because she was\r\nnever anxious to sell, and always said: “Why should I sell my pearls? If\r\nthe Spaniards come to attack us, I can put them in a handkerchief and go\r\ninto the hills; but if I had dollars I should need a number of men to\r\ncarry them.” We do not yet know what became of the stolen pearls.\r\n\r\nMany times has a dealer put nearly all that he possessed into a fine\r\npearl or necklace, frequently without a reward; often gradually buying\r\nmore and more, hoping for some great patron to relieve him. When the\r\nclient appears, there is happiness, but when he does not, there is woe.\r\nThis instance is well illustrated when Philip IV of Spain asked of the\r\nmerchant Gogibus: “How have you ventured to put all your fortune into\r\nsuch a small object?” “Because I knew there was a king of Spain to buy\r\nit of me,” was the quick reply. And Philip rewarded the faith of the\r\njeweler by purchasing the pearl.\r\n\r\nCaire and Dufie[404] state:\r\n\r\n  We need have no fear that either the price or the use of pearls will\r\n  diminish when we consider the great demand for them both on account\r\n  of luxury and superstition. There is no Hindu who does not regard it\r\n  as a matter of religion that he should pierce at least one pearl on\r\n  the occasion of his marriage. This must be a new pearl which has\r\n  never been perforated. Whatever may be the mysterious signification,\r\n  this very ancient usage is, at least, very useful for the commerce\r\n  of pearls.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, one of the writers had a long talk with his late chief, who\r\nhad, at that time, devoted sixty years of his life to the jewelry\r\nprofession. In the course of the conversation the latter remarked: “It\r\nseems to me that pearls are too dear”; to which the writer rejoined:\r\n“Have pearls ever gone down in price during your entire connection with\r\nthe jewelry profession?” The answer was: “No, they have always\r\nadvanced.” Whereupon the writer said: “I can give you statistics for two\r\nhundred years preceding your earliest experience, which prove that\r\npearls constantly advanced in value during that period.”\r\n\r\nThe following are the names given to the different kinds of pearls,\r\naccording to their origin.\r\n\r\nThe term “oriental” designates those pearls that are found in the true\r\npearl-oyster, and have a marine or salt-water origin, being found either\r\nin the ocean or one of its adjacent tributaries, and belonging to one of\r\nthe numerous species of the Margaritiferæ.\r\n\r\nThe term “fresh-water” is given to those pearls that are found in the\r\nfresh-water brooks, rivulets, rivers, or fresh-water lakes, and not in\r\nsalt water, and which belong to the Unionidæ.\r\n\r\nThe term “conch” is applied to that variety of pearl which is usually\r\npink, or yellow, in color, and that is either found in the univalve\r\nshell, known as the common conch (_Strombus gigas_), or in the yellow\r\nshell (_Cassis madagascarensis_).\r\n\r\nThe word “clam pearl” is used to designate those pearls that are found\r\nin the common clam of the Atlantic coast, and are either black, dark\r\npurple, purple, or mixed with white, more especially if they are boiled.\r\n\r\n“Placuna pearl” designates those pearls that are found in the Placuna,\r\nor window-glass shell, in the East. They have a micaceous luster, are\r\nrarely of much value, and are sold entirely in the Orient, almost\r\nexclusively for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\n“Oyster pearl” signifies those concretions that are found in the common\r\nedible oyster (Ostrea). They are generally black, purple, or with a\r\nmixture of black and white, or purple and white. They are devoid of\r\nnacreous luster and possess neither beauty nor value.\r\n\r\n“Coque de perle” designates the globuse walls of the nautilus and\r\npossibly other shells that have a pearly nacre; they are almost\r\nhemispherical and are either round or long, having a pearly effect.\r\n\r\n“Abalone”: a name applied to those pearls that are found in the univalve\r\n“ear-shell” or _awabi_, as it is called in Japan. They are generally\r\ngreen, blue-green, or fawn-yellow, and have an intense red, flame-like\r\niridescence. They are rarely round, generally flat, or irregular, and\r\nare occasionally worth several hundreds of dollars each.\r\n\r\n“Pinna pearls”: those pearls that are found in the Pinna, or wing-shells\r\nof the Mediterranean and adjacent seas. These possess no orient, but are\r\nmore highly crystalline than any other pearls. They are almost\r\ntranslucent and have a peculiar red or yellow color, and are of little\r\nvalue except locally.\r\n\r\n“Cocoanut pearl”: this name is given to those pearls that are found in\r\nthe giant oyster or clam of the vicinity of Singapore; they are\r\nerroneously called cocoanut pearls because they have the appearance of\r\nthe meat of the cocoanut. They are often of great size, but have no\r\ncommercial value.\r\n\r\nThe following are special designations of the different varieties of\r\npearls according to their forms and appearance:\r\n\r\nParagon: this term was formerly used to designate large and\r\nexceptionally perfect or beautiful pearls, usually weighing over one\r\nhundred grains.\r\n\r\nRound: when the pearl is absolutely spherical, as if turned on a lathe,\r\nwithout any flattening or any indentations on the sides.\r\n\r\nButton or Bouton: if the pearl is domed on top and has either a flat or\r\nslightly convex back.\r\n\r\nPear-shaped: when the pearl is formed like a pear, terminating in a\r\npoint, and is either flat at the lower end or rounded.\r\n\r\nDrop-shaped: when the pearl is elongated like a pear, but is larger at\r\nthe lower end than a pear-shaped pearl.\r\n\r\nEgg-shaped: when ovate in form, rounded more or less at each end, or\r\nformed like an egg.\r\n\r\nCone-shaped: applied to pearls that are elongated and rounded with one\r\nflat end, and have the form of a cone.\r\n\r\nTop-shaped: a name given to those pearls that are broad, flattened at\r\nthe top and rounded on the sides, terminating in a point, like a top.\r\n\r\nSeed-pearls is a name given to pearls that are round or irregular, and\r\nweigh one fourth grain or even less. They are frequently so small that\r\n18,000 are contained in a single ounce, and they are often sent from the\r\nEast in bunches of about a dozen or so of strings.\r\n\r\nDust-pearls. When seed-pearls are very small they are known as\r\n“dust-pearls”; they are really as fine as dust and have very little\r\nvalue; still, their form is in many cases wonderfully perfect.\r\n\r\nPetal pearls are those which are somewhat flat, frequently more pointed\r\nat one end than at the other, and have the appearance of a petal or\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\nHinge pearls are those pearls that are long, generally pointed at either\r\nor both ends, and are found near the hinge part of the shell. They are\r\ndivided into two distinct forms, namely dog-tooth, and wing-shaped.\r\n\r\nWing pearls: those that are elongated or irregular, resembling a wing or\r\npart of a wing.\r\n\r\nDog-tooth: applied to pearls with pointed ears, elongated, and which are\r\nnarrower than the wing pearls.\r\n\r\nSlugs: a name used for the very irregular, distorted pearls, frequently\r\nmade up of masses or groups of small pearls; usually without luster or\r\nform, and of little value except for medicinal purposes.\r\n\r\nNuggets: when the pearls are somewhat round, but are indented or\r\nslightly irregular.\r\n\r\nHaystacks: when the pearls are either round or oval, with the top\r\nconsiderably elevated.\r\n\r\nTurtlebacks: when the pearls are a trifle longer than they are wide,\r\nwith a domed surface not much elevated. This form is quite prevalent\r\namong American pearls.\r\n\r\nStrawberry pearls: those that are round or elongated and entirely\r\ncovered with prickly points, somewhat resembling a strawberry or pickle.\r\nIt is believed that these irregular marks are frequently produced by\r\nminute pearls.\r\n\r\n“Blister” and “Chicot” are names applied to those pearls that are found\r\nembedded within a nacreous coating, often containing mud, water, or\r\nimperfect mother-of-pearl. After these “blisters,” as they are termed,\r\nare broken, and layer after layer has been removed from the contents,\r\nvery fine pearls have frequently been found.\r\n\r\nPeelers: a term applied to pearls having imperfect surfaces or skins\r\nthat may have some inner layers which are perfect. Pearls having opaque\r\nbands or rings are rarely peeled with much success as this opaque layer\r\nfrequently extends to some depth.\r\n\r\nCylindrical pearls: for pearls that have the form of a cylinder, being\r\nelongated and flattened at each end.\r\n\r\nHammer pearls: when pearls are long and somewhat rounded and assume the\r\nshape of a hammer or barrel. These are rounded or domed at the side and\r\nflattened at the ends.\r\n\r\nBaroque (Wart pearls in German): when pearls are not of any perfect form\r\nsuch as round, pear, ovate, or any regular form, they are termed\r\nbaroque, and this term covers a large class of varieties, such as all\r\nthat follow (except seed- and half-pearls).\r\n\r\nDouble, triple, or twin pearls are those that are made up of two or more\r\npearls united together in a single nacreous coating, showing, however,\r\nthat they are still separate pearls.\r\n\r\nMonster pearls: this name was formerly applied to very large, irregular,\r\npearly masses which either resembled some animal or were adapted to form\r\nthe head, trunk, or other part of an animal: these are also occasionally\r\ncalled “Paragons.”\r\n\r\nBird’s-eye: a name used for a pearl that has dull spots, giving it the\r\nappearance of a bird’s-eye.\r\n\r\n“Ring-a-round” is a term applied to such pearls as are black, brown,\r\npink, or white, and have a circle running around the pearl itself of\r\nsome distinctive contrasting color, as white on black, pink on brown or\r\nblack on white.\r\n\r\nEmbedded pearls are those that are partly or entirely surrounded by\r\nmother-of-pearl, having been enveloped and passed outward from the\r\ninterior of the shell by the mollusk so that in time the pearl would\r\nhave been lost on the outside of the shell. These embedded pearls are\r\noccasionally found in the manufacture of mother-of-pearl articles. When\r\nthe mother-of-pearl is split, the pearl will fall out from between the\r\nlayers.\r\n\r\nHalf-pearls is the name given to such pearls as are round and\r\nspherically domed, and are either somewhat flat or almost the shape of\r\none half of a whole pearl of the same diameter. They are usually made by\r\ncutting off the best part of a hemispherical bright spot from a large\r\nirregular pearl; frequently two to four cuttings are made from the\r\nbright spots of a single pearl, each of the cuttings having the\r\nappearance of half a pearl.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Indian pearls have a faint rosy tint with much orient.\r\nThese are generally pearls from the Ceylonese fisheries that are sold\r\nfrom the Bombay side. The term “Madras white” describes the whiter\r\nvarieties, there being a preference for these in Madras, while the rosy,\r\nyellow, and darker shades are favored in Bombay.\r\n\r\nAustralian pearls are generally a pure waxy white and lustrous, often\r\nwith a silver-white sheen, extremely brilliant and beautiful.\r\n\r\nNearly all the Venezuela and Panama pearls have a faint golden-yellow\r\ntint, very often extremely lustrous, and are especially desired by the\r\ndarker skinned people and brunettes.\r\n\r\nThe preference at various times has varied with different peoples: in\r\nChina and India, golden-yellow and satin-yellow pearls are preferred;\r\nfrom Panama we have the very white; in Bombay the yellow pearls from the\r\nPersian Gulf are highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nYellow pearls from other shells than the pearl-oyster are frequently\r\noffered for sale in the East, where they are greatly appreciated,\r\nalthough they find little favor in England. Some of these pearls are\r\nattributed to the pearly nautilus (_Nautilus pompilius_). This may be\r\nthe case with those that have a pearly luster, but those that have the\r\nappearance of porcelain, and are as bright as polished china, are\r\ncertainly not from this shell, but evidently from the large Melo or\r\nother shells of that character. Some may come from the large conch\r\n(_Cassis madagascarensis_). A yellow pearl, very perfect in form and\r\ncolor, and weighing more than one hundred grains, was shown at the Paris\r\nExposition of 1889 and was valued at 50,000 francs.\r\n\r\nWonderful golden-yellow pearls with a saffron tint are unusually\r\nlustrous and beautiful. One of the most remarkable pearls of this\r\ncharacter is of a brilliant golden-yellow color which belongs to an\r\nAmerican lady, and weighs 30½ grains. These pearls are from Shark’s Bay,\r\nWest Australia, and only a limited number of them are found annually.\r\n\r\nBlack pearls do not seem to have been regarded with any favor by the\r\nancients, and we find no mention of them by medieval writers. Only fifty\r\nyears ago a perfectly round, black pearl, weighing 8 grains, was sold\r\nfor £4 ($20); to-day this pearl would easily bring £100 ($500). Empress\r\nEugenie, the wife of Napoleon III, may be said to have brought them into\r\nfavor; she owned a splendid necklace of black pearls which was sold at\r\nChristie’s, after the fall of Napoleon, for the sum of £4000 ($20,000).\r\nSome time later, the Marquis of Bath bought, at Christie’s, the pearl\r\nwhich formed the clasp of the necklace, paying £1000 ($5000) for it; he\r\ndestined it for the center of a bracelet.\r\n\r\nGreenish-black pearls are perhaps valued higher than any other colored\r\npearls, if they have the proper orient; this is probably partly owing to\r\ntheir rarity. A bluish-black pearl possessing a fine orient commands\r\nalmost the same price as a pure black pearl. Those which are found in\r\nthe _Placuna placenta_ are often of a dull gray hue, while those\r\nproduced by the _Pinna squamosa_ are generally brown in color.\r\n\r\nBaroque pearls were formerly much worn and appreciated in Spain and\r\nPoland. Their price varies greatly, according to their size, their\r\nbeauty, and also to their scarcity in any particular place. The pieces\r\nof pearl detached from the shells—often half-pearl and half\r\nmother-of-pearl, and called “de fantaisie”—are always very irregular in\r\nform, and sometimes offer a certain resemblance to a part of the human\r\nor animal form.[405]\r\n\r\nHow is it that such quantities of jewels are continually brought from\r\nthe East, and such a wealth of them continues to exist there, when there\r\nare now no very extensive mines that maintain a constant supply? The\r\nreason is that from time immemorial, precious stones have been the form\r\nin which wealth, in those lands, has been hoarded and preserved. Until\r\nvery recently, in the Orient, interest-bearing securities have been\r\nunknown; and hence jewels have been sought and kept as an investment,\r\nand sold only when money was needed for special purposes, as in times of\r\nwar, famine, or other emergency.\r\n\r\nTheir small bulk made them easy to conceal and to transport, and hence\r\nthey were well adapted for such use. How long this condition will last,\r\nis perhaps dependent only upon the introduction of interest-paying\r\ninvestments, and of the new forms of Western civilization that involve\r\ngreater expenses and require means of income in excess of the older and\r\nsimpler conditions.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of jewels possessed by Oriental monarchs, notables, and\r\ndealers, has been the theme of story and tradition, time out of mind. We\r\nof the West have been disposed to regard these tales as largely\r\nexaggerated, and to some extent they may be; yet any one who has\r\nwitnessed an important social function or state occasion where East\r\nIndian rajahs and nabobs are present, knows that the profusion of jewels\r\nwhich they wear is simply astounding to our Western eyes. These objects\r\nrepresent, moreover, the gatherings of generations and centuries; they\r\nare heirlooms and ancestral treasures, priceless to their owners as the\r\npride of their houses; handed down from fathers to sons in long\r\nsuccession; and they have also the investment feature already noted, in\r\nthat whenever necessity arises they can be turned into available funds.\r\n\r\nThe manner of keeping and of selling such objects is also different from\r\nours. If it be a question of buying gems from an Eastern owner, the best\r\nare never shown first, but on the contrary, the most inferior. The\r\npurchaser must either be content with these, or else must prove clearly\r\nthat he is a substantial buyer or evince a knowledge and appreciation\r\nthat mark him as a judge of such objects. The order in which they are\r\nproduced is, first the poorest, then successively, poor, medium, fair,\r\ngood, fine, and at last the rare and wonderful prizes.\r\n\r\nIn visiting an Oriental dignitary, his jewel-treasures are not all shown\r\nat once, as at an American reception or an Indian durbar, or even as a\r\ncollector or connoisseur among us exhibits his cabinet, arranged for\r\nchoice display. The method is far different. The visitor may be shown a\r\nfew objects in the first day or hour; perhaps a few more later in the\r\nday; some on the next day or the one following, and so on; and he may\r\nremain a guest for weeks, and never see all, or the finest of the jewels\r\nbelonging to his host. When they are produced, moreover, they are not in\r\niron caskets or in gold or silver jewel-cases, covered or lined with\r\nfine leather or with silk or satin. On the contrary, they are often in\r\nold ginger jars, shabby boxes, tin cans, and all sorts of unsightly or\r\nunpromising receptacles, which, when placed between the owner and his\r\nguest, may well cause the latter to wonder. Nor is his surprise lessened\r\nas the wrappings are unfolded, one after another, perhaps a dozen old\r\ncloths, until the piece of jewelry or the splendid pearl is at last\r\nbrought to view, after having been hidden from sight in its manifold\r\nwrappings for months or perhaps for years.\r\n\r\nBut this method of keeping such treasures is not in reality so strange\r\nas it appears. There are none of the provisions that we have for the\r\nresponsible safe-guarding of investments or valuable objects,—no\r\nfire-proof safes, no banks, no deposit-vaults. Security is best attained\r\nby concealment in unattractive and improbable receptacles, and by\r\ndividing and distributing the treasured objects. The owner, too, must\r\nlearn to know his visitor quite well before he exhibits to him all, or\r\nthe best, that he possesses. Hence the oriental method, though so\r\npeculiar to us, has been the best adapted to the conditions among those\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Seed-pearls and gold; Chinese ornaments of the nineteenth century\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Complete set of seed-pearl jewelry in original case\r\n\r\n  New York, 1860\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the interest taken by Oriental potentates in the\r\ncollection of jewels, we quote an instance from Marco Polo, who,\r\ncenturies ago, wrote the following:[406] “Several times every year the\r\nKing of Maabar sends his proclamation through the realm that if any one\r\nwho possesses a pearl or stone of great value will bring it to him, he\r\nwill pay for it twice as much as it cost. Everybody is glad to do this,\r\nand thus the King gets all into his own hands, giving every man his\r\nprice.”\r\n\r\nGreat quantities of pearls, the result of centuries of accumulation, and\r\nexceeding in splendor the collections of the present day, must have been\r\ngarnered up in many cities of the Orient during the period of their\r\nprosperity. But these cities have disappeared, wrecked and ruined by\r\nfire and sword, and no vestige of their former wealth remains with them.\r\nTheir treasures have been looted, hoarded, buried, or scattered to the\r\nfour ends of the Orient, frequently finding their way in former times to\r\nEurope, but now more often to America, where fine gems always find a\r\ngenerous buyer.\r\n\r\nIn Syria, and some of the Oriental countries, until recently, and\r\nperhaps at the present time, it has been the custom, when a native\r\nwished to embark in the pearl business, for him to allow himself to\r\ndrift gradually into a state of vagrancy, becoming a veritable tramp for\r\nfully a year. Then, with the money that he had himself or that which was\r\nsupplied by his backer, he would visit the pearl fisheries and shrewdly\r\nacquire the gems to the best advantage, returning again as a vagrant;\r\nfor if it were known at any point along the route that he carried with\r\nhim sums of money his life would be in jeopardy, and he would probably\r\nnever reach the fisheries; or, if he did, the chances are that he would\r\nnever return. This may remind us of Marco Polo’s old coat, in which he\r\nhad concealed some valuable gems, the gift of the Grand Khan. His wife\r\nheedlessly gave the coat to a beggar and it was only regained by a\r\nclever stratagem.\r\n\r\nThe product of the pearl fisheries, either that of entire fisheries\r\nwhere they are managed by a company, or the gatherings of merchants, or\r\neven the single gems which may be acquired by the smaller merchants, all\r\nthese usually find their way to the great markets, although occasionally\r\nthey change hands at once. In the East they are sent either to Bombay,\r\nCalcutta, Madras or Colombo; frequently they are intended for a higher\r\nmarket. Many of them remain in the East, for in the East to-day a fine\r\npearl is as much prized as ever, and there are those who love pearls as\r\nmuch as did the King of Maabar in the time of Marco Polo. However, the\r\nworld over, there is a feeling that if things are sent to the greatest\r\nmarket there will be an opportunity for disposing of them at the\r\ngreatest price. Therefore, the larger number of parcels of exceptionally\r\nfine pearls are sent to the London market, a few of them going to Paris,\r\nthe cable, often within a few days after their arrival, informing the\r\nsender of the acceptance or rejection of a parcel, or of a new offer\r\nwhich is often accepted. In this market they are acquired by the\r\ndealers, who frequently exhibit many times before the lot is purchased.\r\n\r\nPearls from a fishery are in many cases of mixed quality; that is to\r\nsay, they are of different sizes and varying grades of perfection as\r\nregards skin, color, and orient. These parcels are often sold directly\r\non offers to dealers, but generally they are sold by brokers who show\r\nthe various parcels to the dealers, each of the latter in turn making\r\nhis offer on that portion of the parcel which is of most value to him.\r\nThus a single dealer may want one pearl, a dozen, or even twenty or\r\nmore, to complete a great necklace, or else to add to, or improve the\r\nnecklace, by better graduation or by increasing the evenness of the\r\ncolor. When the broker receives enough offers to give him the desired\r\nprice for the entire parcel, the sale is consummated, and each one who\r\nhas made an offer and who has sealed his particular parcel until his\r\noffer is accepted or rejected, receives his portion. Pearls do not grow\r\nin the form of necklaces, although they are frequently seen in this form\r\nonly, and to create a large necklace means not only the use of the\r\npearls of one fishery alone, but it often requires a selection from\r\npearls of various sizes, the product of many fisheries.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that even the shrewdest dealers do not always\r\nsucceed in their purchases of lots which are to be broken up when the\r\nproper number of bids are obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen the pearl revival came in 1898 there was a sudden and rapid upward\r\ntendency in the prices, because at that time, in England, money could be\r\nborrowed upon a very low rate of interest—as low as 3 per cent.,—and it\r\nwas a temptation to a number of young men to enter as dealers into the\r\npearl trade. The result was that a number of new stocks were created,\r\nnot for a regular, but for a speculative demand, and this tended to\r\nadvance the price spasmodically, rather than gradually, as it would have\r\nrisen by regular consumption. However, when the foreign market became\r\nhigher, the demand for pearls was not as great as had been anticipated,\r\nand there was a sudden adjustment of prices and a readjustment of the\r\npearl stocks, resulting in the elimination of a certain number of\r\nspeculative dealers; and, notwithstanding the state of the fisheries,\r\npearls have not advanced so rapidly in the past two years as they did\r\nfrom 1898 to 1905.\r\n\r\nMore than go per cent. of the pearls of commerce, whether they are\r\nround, perfect, half- or seed-pearls, are of oriental origin; that is,\r\npearls from the true pearl-oyster. About 8 per cent. are probably from\r\nthe fresh-water mussels, three fourths of which are from the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nAmerican fresh-water pearls have had many prejudices to overcome, often\r\nbecause of the natural indifference in regard to anything that is found\r\nat home or is easily obtainable. It has been said that, in comparison\r\nwith foreign pearls, they had less specific gravity; that they were not\r\nso hard, and that their luster was not as good. It is certain, however,\r\nthat the skin is generally smooth, and although they may not have so\r\npeculiar an orient, their brilliancy equals that of any known pearls.\r\nSometimes they are translucent and either pink or of a faintly bluish\r\ntint, like molten silver. More frequently their hue is white, rose, pale\r\nyellow, or pale copper, deepening to copper red until they resemble the\r\nmost intense and highly polished copper button.\r\n\r\nAccording to the estimates of the value of European fresh-water pearls\r\ngiven by seventeenth and eighteenth century writers, their worth was\r\nconsidered to be one half that of oriental pearls of approximately the\r\nsame quality. Few European pearls, we feel sure, were ever found that\r\npossessed the wonderful beauty and brilliancy of the pearls found either\r\nin the Miami or the Mississippi and its many tributaries.\r\n\r\nSo great a quantity of the poorer quality of pearls have been found,\r\nprincipally in the Mississippi Valley, that a foreign dealer has bought\r\n30,000 ounces of baroque pearls at $1 an ounce, and of the slightly\r\nbetter grades fully 100,000 dollars’ worth were obtained in the year\r\n1906. The exportation was strictly limited to the poorer qualities. When\r\npearls are worth from $1 to $6 a grain and upward, they are rarely sent\r\nabroad, as the regular pearls of this quality are much appreciated by\r\nAmericans, and find a ready sale in the United States. The poor pearls\r\nabove mentioned were principally sent to New York, either from the local\r\nfishermen, or else through the dealers in sweet-water shells, in lots of\r\na fraction of an ounce, or in bags weighing a number of pounds. Thirty\r\nthousand ounces would equal 18,180,000 grains.\r\n\r\nAfter all the fine pearls have been selected—buttons, baroques,\r\nturtle-backs, haystacks, wings, petals and other pearls that can be used\r\nin any way as a jewel on this side of the water—the balance of the\r\nmaterial is sold by the ounce, varying in price from $1 to $5. These are\r\nshipped to Germany, France, and Austria, where they are again selected\r\nfor cheaper forms of jewelry than are made in the United States. Of\r\nthese pearls the baroques and slugs go mainly to Germany, while the\r\nsomewhat finer ones are sent to France, where they are used in artistic\r\nbut inexpensive work, such as flowers and other imitative forms, and in\r\n_art nouveau_ jewelry. Some, again, are shipped to Algiers, Morocco, and\r\nEgypt, for the decoration of saddles, garments, etc., and quantities go\r\nto India to be used for medicinal purposes. In this way all the material\r\nis utilized and even the poorest is not wasted. No better proof can be\r\nrequired of the wide-spread appreciation of the pearl among all the\r\nraces of mankind.\r\n\r\nSo extensive has become the finding of American pearls that great\r\nquantities have been gathered together of all varieties. At the time of\r\nthis writing there are many large single lots of these pearls, slightly\r\nirregular, and not of fine quality, but yet of sufficient regularity of\r\nsize to be termed baroques. At one time such quantities were gotten\r\ntogether that single papers of pearls, weighing one fourth, one half,\r\none, two or three grains each, contained more than 10,000 grains, and\r\nquantities of the wing and dog-tooth varieties weighing as much as\r\n20,000 grains were inclosed in a single paper.\r\n\r\nSo prolific has been the yield of these common American pearls that the\r\nmarkets of Europe and Asia have almost been flooded with them. In 1906,\r\na single shipment of 3500 ounces, troy (equaling over 2,100,000 grains),\r\nwere sent abroad, at prices varying from $1 to $15 per ounce, according\r\nto the quality. This alone would represent a worth of $30,000 at one\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe turtleback is a form quite prevalent among American pearls, and they\r\nare often matched in pairs slightly resembling each other and weighing\r\nfrom 10 to 100 or more grains for each pair. Some of them are lustrous\r\nand many are of very good color and regular in form. Although differing\r\nbut little in shape, they naturally are much less expensive than a finer\r\nformed pearl, and many of them have been sold for link buttons, and more\r\nespecially for earscrews. Although they formerly sold for 50 cents a\r\ngrain, they are now held at from $1 to $8 per grain.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the prices of some of the finer American pearls, one of 15\r\ngrains, of wonderful brilliancy, luster, and perfection, was sold for\r\nmore than $2500–$166 a grain, or a base value of over $11 a grain. Two\r\nextraordinarily well-matched button pearls, weighing a trifle over 30\r\ngrains, were held at about $3500, or $115 a grain, a base value of about\r\n$8 a grain.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this writing there are for sale in the United States a\r\npair of button earrings, almost round, not of absolutely perfect color,\r\nweighing about 140 grains, the price being $6000; a round, slightly\r\novate pearl, not of the finest color, weighing 85 grains, held at $3500;\r\nand a wonderful pearl with a rich, faintly pink luster, round, but\r\nslightly button on each side, weighing about 44 grains, and beautiful as\r\nare American pearls, is held at a fanciful valuation of over $6000.\r\n\r\nThe cupidity of many of the American pearl finders and pearl dealers\r\ncannot be exceeded even by that of the foreign pearl finder in any other\r\nland, and this is shown by the variety of materials that from time to\r\ntime are sold to the unsuspecting public, or that are sent to pearl\r\ndealers in the large cities. This is surprising and suggests either that\r\nthe sender believes the pearl dealers are not familiar with these\r\ndeceptions, or else that he himself has been imposed upon, and is\r\ninnocent in his commercial deceit. Among the notable examples are,\r\nfirst, spheres made out of the various shells, either from a good part\r\nof the material or from hinge-material, or else from the spot where the\r\nmussel is attached, these pieces of the shell being rounded and\r\npolished; such spheres vary in color from white to pink or yellow, just\r\nas the shell itself may have been colored. Second, the pupils of\r\nfish-eyes. Third, imitation pearls. Fourth, yellow or brown translucent\r\nor transparent masses of hinge-binding material having no greater\r\nhardness than horn, and about the same appearance. The most interesting,\r\nhowever, are the absolutely beautiful, smooth spheres of anthracite\r\ncoal, which admits of a rich polish and has a peculiar luster; these\r\nthey attempt to pass off as black pearls.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in Arkansas a negro sold a very valuable\r\npearl for a few dollars, under the persuasion of a white man, who, it is\r\nsaid, resold the pearl for nearly a hundred times more than what he paid\r\nfor it. The local authorities investigated the matter; the case was\r\nbrought to court, and the negro received a large advance on the price\r\nthat had originally been paid him.\r\n\r\nIf a list were kept of the thousand and one different methods of\r\nwrapping American pearls for shipment to the larger cities, it would\r\nshow how much ingenuity is displayed in environments that frequently\r\ndiffer very much from each other. A box that has contained the pills\r\nthat relieved him of fever, ague, and other ills due to swamps and damp\r\nclimates, serves a secondary purpose for the fortunate finder of a pearl\r\nin forming a receptacle in which he can ship it to the greater market.\r\nSometimes they are sewed in leather cut from gloves and shoes, or in\r\nstrips of cloth, generally of the humbler varieties, such as calico or\r\nblue jean; in other cases they are wrapped in tissue-paper and\r\nnewspaper; and occasionally they are packed in boxes made by hollowing\r\nout a bit of wood, a cover being nailed over the opening. In almost\r\nevery instance they have been treated with a certain degree of care.\r\n\r\nThe majority of conch pearls which are carried by individuals to New\r\nYork, London, or Paris, are generally brought in small papers or bits of\r\ncloth, each pearl being wrapped separately. Usually, there are a few\r\nwhite ones, a few yellow, a few pale pink, occasionally a few of a very\r\nbeautiful rich pink, and once in a great while a fine, large pearl\r\nappears. Many of these pearls, commonly the inferior ones, are sold in\r\nthe West Indies directly to the tourists who wish to purchase something\r\nin the country through which they are traveling, with the result that\r\nbetter prices are generally obtained than would have been secured if the\r\npearls had been sent to the great markets.\r\n\r\nThe tariff on pearls at present operative in the United States is so\r\nindefinite as to have led to much serious misinterpretation and\r\nmisunderstanding, as well as to an endless chain of lawsuits, often\r\nresulting in serious loss to the dealer or client who imports. As a\r\nconsequence of the enforced outlay of large sums for unexpected and\r\nadditional duties, the importer, who was both ready and willing to pay\r\nwhat seemed to him a just duty, often found that, where he had quoted a\r\nprice to a customer, he was a loser by the transaction; and if, to\r\nescape this loss, he endeavors to dispute the payment of the duty, he\r\nbecomes involved in an expensive and occasionally unsuccessful lawsuit.\r\nOn the other hand, a private buyer who has paid all that he feels he can\r\nafford at the time for a necklace, expecting to pay a duty of 10 per\r\ncent. and interpreting the law to mean a duty of 10 per cent., may be\r\ncalled upon to pay a duty of 60 per cent., or have the notoriety of a\r\npublic lawsuit, because the pearls have been strung, or because it is\r\nheld that they had recently or at some former time been assembled as a\r\nnecklace. In other words, if the pearls constituting such a necklace are\r\nbought at various times from various people, either here or in Europe,\r\nand not as a necklace, the duty is held to be 10 per cent., but if they\r\nare sent in one shipment, a duty of 60 per cent. is levied. As it is\r\nheld that pearls assembled in the form of a necklace have a greater\r\nvalue than before they were so assembled, the purchaser might naturally\r\nexpect to pay the 10 per cent. duty on this higher value, but instead of\r\nthis a 60 per cent. duty is demanded on the higher assembled value.\r\n\r\nThe ambiguity of this clause of the tariff is such that a logical ruling\r\nshould be made by some superior official such as the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury. As the law is now interpreted, a pearl worth $20,000 can be\r\nbrought in with a duty of 10 per cent.; the addition of a simple gold\r\nwire makes it a piece of jewelry, with a duty of 60 per cent. It would\r\nseem that an amendment might be made to the tariff by which an importer,\r\nwhether a private buyer or dealer, could be called upon to pay a 60 per\r\ncent. duty on a high valuation of the setting of the ring, brooch, or\r\njewel, such as $20, $25 or $50; while the contents of the ring or\r\nornament, whether a pearl, diamond, emerald, or a collection of stones,\r\nshould pay a duty of only 10 per cent. This duty would sufficiently\r\nprotect the jewelry industry, and would at the same time prevent the\r\nlevying of an unjust and unexpected impost upon a fine pearl or gem of\r\nany kind.\r\n\r\nIt is eminently desirable that those residing in the United States who\r\npurchase pearls in foreign countries, should, if possible, consult with\r\nthe United States consul in the city where they make their purchase, in\r\ncase they wish to bring the pearls into the United States. In this way a\r\nproper declaration can be made, they will be correctly instructed as to\r\nthe duties upon the pearls, whether unstrung, strung, or set, and they\r\nwill thus avoid all complications when they reach the United States. Of\r\ncourse, this may not be necessary should the firm with which they are\r\ndealing be able to attend to the matter for them.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the duty of 25 per cent. on precious\r\nstones, which was imposed during Cleveland’s administration, was enacted\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining an increased revenue for the government,\r\nand there is no doubt but that the time was one of great financial\r\nstress. Yet even with the duty two and a half times as high as in the\r\nprevious years, only a small fraction was added to the income of the\r\nGovernment. But one adequate explanation can be given of this remarkable\r\ndecrease in the recorded imports, more especially when we consider that\r\nlegitimate dealers could, at that time, buy precious stones in New York\r\nCity for less than it cost them to purchase them abroad and pay the\r\nduty. It seems, therefore, that a 10 per cent. rate is calculated to\r\nproduce the best and most satisfactory results in every way.\r\n\r\nAs examples of the difficulties encountered in the attempt to arrive at\r\na proper classification of pearls we cite the following cases which have\r\nbeen the subjects of recent litigation: In 1901, two very valuable\r\ncollections of pearls were brought to this country. One of these\r\nconsisted of 45 drilled pearls weighing in all 672⅛ grains and entered\r\nat $60,734; the other, of 39 pearls, having an aggregate weight of 678¾\r\ngrains and entered at $63,070. At first a duty of 20 per cent. ad\r\nvalorem was imposed upon these pearls under Section 6 of the Tariff Act,\r\ntreating them as “unenumerated articles partly manufactured,” according\r\nto the rule that had been followed since the enactment of the present\r\ntariff. This was protested, and the case was brought before the Board of\r\nAppraisers.[407] Subsequent to the protest, however, the collector\r\nreliquidated the entry of the 45 pearls and imposed upon them a duty of\r\n60 per cent. ad valorem, as pearls set or strung. This was done in view\r\nof Judge Lacombe’s decision in another notable case which had been taken\r\nshortly before to the Circuit Court of Appeals.[408] This decision was\r\nto the effect that pearls in any form not especially covered by\r\nparagraphs 434 or 436 of the Tariff Act should be referred to one or the\r\nother of those paragraphs, by similitude, according to the provisions of\r\nSection 7 of the Act.\r\n\r\nThe testimony taken before the Board of Appraisers revealed the fact\r\nthat each of the collections of pearls had been inclosed in a handsome\r\nsilk-lined morocco case, with a groove running through the center; in\r\nthis groove the pearls were laid, the largest one in the middle and the\r\nothers disposed on either side, graduated according to their size; the\r\nrow or series having the effect of a necklace, although the pearls were\r\nunstrung. The importer testified that this arrangement was only made in\r\norder to enable him to judge of the size and quality of the pearls, and\r\nevidence was given showing that it was necessary to rebore some of them\r\nand to ream out the holes before any use could be made of the pearls in\r\njewelry. Nevertheless, the appraisers adhered to their opinion that\r\nthese gems had been selected especially to form a necklace, and that the\r\ntime and labor requisite for the assembling of a carefully matched and\r\ngraduated series of pearls suitable for a necklace constituted the main\r\nfactor in its production, since the cost of stringing it was trifling;\r\nthey, therefore, considered that such a series of pearls was dutiable,\r\nby similitude, under paragraph 434 of the Tariff Act as jewelry. An\r\napplication was made to the Circuit Court of the Southern District of\r\nNew York for a review of the appraisers’ ruling,[409] the judge decided\r\nagainst the petitioner,[410] and an appeal was then taken from his\r\ndecision. On December 12, 1904, the Circuit Court of Appeals decided\r\nthat the pearls were dutiable, by similitude, at 10 per cent. ad\r\nvalorem, under Section 7, paragraph 436, and the excess of duty\r\ncollected was refunded.\r\n\r\nAnother case has to do with a collection of 37 pearls, entered at\r\n$220,000, brought to New York in January, 1906. Duty to the amount of\r\n$22,000 (10 per cent. ad valorem) was paid by the importer, but the\r\nentry was liquidated at 60 per cent. and $110,000 additional duty\r\ndemanded. This was paid and a protest was made to the Board of General\r\nAppraisers, who decided in favor of the petitioner. The Government\r\nappealed and the case[411] was tried in the United States Circuit Court\r\non February 24 of this year (1908). It was shown that the pearls had\r\nbeen worn several times in Paris as a necklace, but the defense held\r\nthat, as they were loose when imported and were not worth more\r\ncollectively than separately, this was not material. The judge decided\r\nfor the Government and an appeal has been taken in June, 1908.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PERSIAN PRINCESS AND LADIES IN WAITING\r\n\r\n  From a Persian illuminated manuscript of the eighteenth century, in\r\n    the library of Robert Hoe, Esq.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe proper classification of half-pearls has also been a matter of\r\ncontroversy. This question was brought before the Board of General\r\nAppraisers in New York on a protest[412] entered in 1897 against the\r\nimposition of a duty of 20 per cent. on several lots of so-called\r\nhalf-pearls imported during that year. This duty was imposed under\r\nSection 6 of the Tariff Act, providing for a duty of 20 per cent. on\r\n“unenumerated partly manufactured articles.” The petitioner claimed that\r\nhalf-pearls were dutiable at 10 per cent. ad valorem, “either directly\r\nor by similitude or component of chief value, under paragraph 436, or as\r\nprecious stones, under paragraph 435 of the Tariff Act.” After hearing\r\nthe testimony of a number of competent and reliable experts connected\r\nwith some of the leading houses dealing in precious stones and pearls,\r\nthe appraisers decided that the evidence showed that pearls, being the\r\nproduct of animal secretion, could not properly be denominated stones,\r\nand that they were not in fact so designated commercially. At the same\r\ntime, half-pearls could not be looked upon as “pearls in their natural\r\nstate,” since time and labor had been expended in their production; it\r\nwas, therefore, evident that paragraph 436 did not apply to them. For\r\nthis reason the original ruling was reaffirmed.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 a duty of 60 per cent. was levied on an assorted lot of\r\nhalf-pearls under a new ruling which brought them by similitude under\r\nthe provisions of paragraph 434 of the Tariff Act, providing a duty of\r\n60 per cent. on “jewelry ... including ... pearls set or strung.” A\r\nprotest was entered against this ruling also.[413] In the meanwhile\r\nJudge Lacombe had given the opinion to which we have alluded above, and\r\nthe Board of Appraisers upheld the duty of 60 per cent., basing their\r\ndecision upon the fact that the material of half-pearls was similar to\r\nthat of pearls in their natural state or of pearls set or strung, thus\r\nsatisfying the requirements as to similitude of Section 7 of the Tariff\r\nAct. The same section provides that, in case two or more rates of duty\r\nshall be applicable to any imported article, it shall pay duty at the\r\nhighest rate, and therefore the 60–per cent. rate applying to pearls set\r\nor strung was imposed, instead of the 10–per cent. rate on pearls in\r\ntheir natural state. In both of these cases an application for a review\r\nwas made to the United States Circuit Court.[414]\r\n\r\n           DUTIES ON PEARLS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, MARCH, 1908\r\n\r\n                                                   Amount in\r\n                                                  money of the   U.

Previous to 1891 pearls were classified with “jewelry and\r\n   precious stones,” and it was not until 1895 that most of them were\r\n                          reported separately.\r\n\r\nThere are several things that are essential in pearl buying, and one of\r\nthe most important of these is that the light in which the pearls are\r\nselected shall be absolutely pure daylight, with no reflections from the\r\nside or from above that can enhance or detract from the color of the\r\npearl. This must be carefully considered, as it is not uncommon—more\r\nespecially in certain parts of Europe—that jewelers have for their\r\nselling-offices rooms sumptuously fitted up with hangings of different\r\ncolors, and sometimes with ground glass windows, provided with heavy\r\nsilk hangings, so that artificial light becomes a necessity to make the\r\narticle sold plainly visible. In absolutely pure daylight, more\r\nespecially with an unclouded sky—on such days as are probably more\r\nfrequent in the United States than in some of the European countries—it\r\nis possible to see the exact tint or color of the pearls; that is,\r\nwhether it is really a pure white with a tinge of pink or an orient\r\ntending to cream-white, or whether it is more or less tinted with what\r\nis considered a crude or red color in a pearl. Besides this, in a pure\r\nlight it is possible to see whether the pearl is brilliant, and to\r\nestimate the exact degree of its brilliancy; whether there are any\r\ncracks, scratches, or mars on the surface; and, lastly, whether the form\r\nis entirely regular. If one should select two necklaces, one absolutely\r\nperfect and the other having slight blemishes as to color or brilliancy,\r\nor with breaks, marks, or irregularities, these two necklaces would be\r\nscarcely distinguishable from each other in artificial light, or in\r\ndaylight which had been partly confused with artificial light; although\r\nthe differences between the two would signify that the former was worth\r\ntwo or three times as much as the latter.\r\n\r\nAt great receptions, large, and apparently magnificent pearls are\r\nfrequently seen, which are really of inferior quality, and yet, owing to\r\nthe absence of pure daylight, they can easily be mistaken for perfect\r\nspecimens by any one not especially familiar with pearls. Indeed, if the\r\nroyalties of Europe should wear all the pearls belonging to the crown\r\njewels at the same time, in a palace or hall lighted with candles, gas,\r\nor even with some types of electric light, they would frequently seem to\r\nhave a quality which many of them do not and never did possess. It is,\r\ntherefore, essential for the buyer to use every precaution in reference\r\nto the light in which he examines his purchase. And we may add that it\r\nis just as essential that he should know the dealer from whom he buys;\r\nfor, sometimes, after a few weeks or months, cracks or blemishes develop\r\nthat were not apparent at first, more especially when the pearls have\r\nbeen “improved” for a prospective purchaser.\r\n\r\nA test to ascertain the quality of pearls is quaintly expressed in a\r\nwork published in 1778, as follows:\r\n\r\n  How to know good pearls. To discover the hidden Defects and Faults\r\n  of a Pearl and to know whether she is speckled or broken or has any\r\n  other imperfections, the best way is to make trial of it by the\r\n  Reverberation of the Sun-beams; for by this means your eye will\r\n  penetrate into the very Centre of the Pearl and discover the least\r\n  defect it has; you will then see whether it be pure, or has any\r\n  spots or not, and consequently you may the better guess its\r\n  value.[415]\r\n\r\nIf you can cause a ray of sunlight or of electric light to fall on a\r\npearl, the light will penetrate it and show any specks, inclosed\r\nblemishes or impurities. This can probably best be done by wrapping\r\nabout the pearl a dark cloth of velvet or other material and having the\r\nray fall slantingly, whereby the defects are much more clearly shown\r\nthan if the ray be allowed to fall directly upon the gem.\r\n\r\nA pearl necklace valued at $200,000, shown at one of our recent great\r\nexpositions, was to all appearances a remarkably beautiful collection,\r\nand it was only when the intending purchaser took them from their velvet\r\nbed and held them in his hands that he realized that there was not a\r\nperfect pearl in the entire collection. It must have taken more than a\r\nweek of study for the clever dealer to arrange them so that the best\r\npart, sometimes the only good part of each pearl, should be where the\r\neye would fall upon it. After they had been turned in the hands a few\r\nseconds, not one perfect specimen was visible.\r\n\r\nThe demand for pearls has been so great, and the enhancement of value so\r\nrapid, that the greatest ingenuity has been employed in presenting the\r\nbest part of the gems to view, as well as in many other ways. The result\r\nis that when pearls are to be used as borders or as a gallery on a comb\r\nor brooch, they are pierced in such a way that only the best side shall\r\nbe outward, so that the general effect produced is that of a perfect row\r\nof pearls; but a careful examination may show that two thirds or three\r\nfourths of them are irregular, and bear abrasion marks, indentations, or\r\nother imperfections.\r\n\r\nFollowing the analogy of the well-known precious stones—the diamond, the\r\nruby, the sapphire, the emerald and those of less importance—the pearl\r\nis equally potent in creating great and permanent values for itself in\r\ncatering to the human love of adornment; and though these large values\r\nmay be greatly in excess of the original price that it commanded in the\r\nnative oriental market, yet the increased valuation gives profitable\r\nlivelihood to hundreds of thousands of persons. These embrace the\r\ndealers who sell the original pearls in lots, those who clean and treat\r\nthem, others who drill and string them, and others again who handle them\r\nin setting jewelry of all kinds, and also the large number of dealers\r\nthroughout the entire world who sell either the jewelry or the unmounted\r\npearls. Directly connected with the industry in localities where the\r\nfisheries are pursued are a sufficient number of persons to populate a\r\ncity the size of Boston, and to these we may safely add an equal number\r\nas herein noted, aggregating about 1,000,000 people whose livelihood is\r\ndirectly dependent upon the production and traffic of the pearl\r\nindustry, and who for lack of it would be forced to seek some other\r\nemployment. Brought thus to a concrete form, one may readily grasp the\r\nimportant bearing which the pearl has in a comprehensive estimate of the\r\ncomplexity of the world’s civilization as we know it to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n\r\n                      TREATMENT AND CARE OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XIV\r\n                      TREATMENT AND CARE OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pearl is at the height of its perfection when taken from the shell;\r\nfrom that moment it never improves. When it is drawn from the depths of\r\nthe ocean by the hand of man and given to the charmed gaze of the world,\r\nit is as complete and perfect in its way as the most beautiful work of\r\nart, and, whether as tiny as the point of a pin or as large as a marble,\r\nit is always a perfect, fully formed individual; it is always in its\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nWho found the first pearl? When did he discover it, and what were his\r\nemotions? Was it found by primitive man? Very likely it was discovered\r\nby chance in a mother-of-pearl shell cast up by the sea, or perhaps in a\r\nmussel in a brook. If this happened in an oriental country, the native\r\nmust have already seen many equally remarkable objects, endowed with\r\nlife, while the pearl could charm him only by its luster and purity.\r\nBut, besides the impression produced by its beauty, it must have aroused\r\nin the soul of the discoverer the sensation of wonder which every new\r\nand lovely object excites when seen for the first time. That primitive\r\nman appreciated the pearl is evidenced by the fact that it is found in\r\nthe mounds and graves of the American continent, from the State of Ohio\r\nto Peru in South America.\r\n\r\nAlmost all pearls are in perfect condition for setting when they are\r\nfound; all that needs to be done is to rub them with a damp or moist\r\ncloth or with a powder of finely pulverized small or broken pearls, and\r\nthey are then ready for the succeeding processes. If there are any\r\nblemishes, these can be removed by peeling or “faking,” although few\r\nfine pearls require any such treatment; and then the gems may be\r\ndrilled, strung, and set, and all that is necessary for their\r\npreservation is due care and attention.\r\n\r\nPearls are frequently injured in opening the shells or in removal of the\r\nouter layers around the true pearly nacre. Both the Chinese and the Sulu\r\nfishermen are very clever in the art of pearl peeling and pearl\r\nimproving. This method is called “faking,” although it is a perfectly\r\nlegitimate operation. All it requires is a very sharp knife, a set of\r\nfiles, and a powder obtained by grinding pearls or pearl shells. This\r\npowder is placed upon a buffer of leather or cloth to polish such parts\r\nof a layer as may not have been entirely removed. The Chinese are\r\nunusual adepts in pearl peeling and have been frequently known to sell\r\nas true pearls scales that they have removed, after filling these scales\r\nor peelings with wax or shellac, and strengthening them by cementing\r\nthem on a piece of mother-of-pearl. They are then set with the convex\r\nside up and the edges carefully covered so as to conceal the deception.\r\nThe Chinese are also very expert in removing layers of mother-of-pearl\r\nfrom an encysted or buried pearl, taking off layer after layer with the\r\ngreatest care, and with a delicacy of touch that enables them to realize\r\nthe moment when the pearl itself has been reached, rarely injuring the\r\nlatter, although the coating is almost as hard as the inclosed pearl.\r\n\r\nPeeling is employed to remove a protuberance or acid stain, to smooth a\r\nsurface broken by abrasion, or to take off a dead spot produced by\r\ncareless wearing of the pearls and allowing them to rub against one\r\nanother. There are many instances where, by careful peeling, a perfect\r\nlayer and skin have been brought to light, and where irregular or broken\r\npearls, or those with a blemish, have been rendered much more valuable\r\nby a good peeler. But in many other cases the pearl has not only been\r\nreduced in value, but even rendered altogether worthless, when it had a\r\ndead center or was pitted with clay or other impurities.\r\n\r\nIf a pearl has been injured by coming in contact with the acids\r\nfrequently used in medicine, the surface may become roughened; or it may\r\nbe scratched by being rubbed against a stone in case of a fall or other\r\naccident. If the surface only is injured, it can be restored to its\r\noriginal beauty with only a slight loss of weight by carefully peeling\r\noff the outer layers.\r\n\r\nIn skinning or peeling a pearl, a magnifying glass, or preferably a\r\nfixed lens, such as is used by engravers, is of great assistance, and a\r\nsharp knife, or, better still, the sharpened edge of a steel file, is a\r\nvery essential instrument. Gloves are often worn by the peeler so that\r\nno perspiration shall reach the pearl and cause it to slip in the hand\r\nwhile it is being manipulated, and thus have a layer or more injured by\r\nthe knife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Drilling a pearl by means of the bow-drill\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Thin layers of pearl removed by peeling (faking)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Examples of properly and poorly drilled pearls\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Side view of same pearls\r\n]\r\n\r\n                             PEARL DRILLING\r\n\r\nStreeter mentions a very interesting incident in regard to a genuine\r\nblack pearl. This pearl, set with diamonds, was shown in a jeweler’s\r\nwindow; but after exposure in this way for some time to the sun’s rays,\r\nthe brilliant black luster disappeared and gave place to a dull, grayish\r\nhue. When the pearl was removed from its setting, it was seen that the\r\npart which had not been exposed to the light was of as good color as\r\nwhen first removed from the shell. It was finally determined to skin off\r\nthe outer layer, an operation which was performed with so much success\r\nthat the original brilliant black hue was fully restored, proving that\r\nthe action of the sunlight had only changed the color of the surface. We\r\nmay add that the pearl, although it was shown in the sun, may never have\r\nhad a good “skin” or layer exposed; or the layer which was not perfect\r\nmay have been affected by an exudation of the wearer produced by illness\r\nor medicine.\r\n\r\nWhen pearls are of a poor yellow or dull brown tint, unscrupulous\r\ndealers sometimes intrust them to an operator who drills them almost\r\nentirely through, cracks the skin slightly and impregnates them with a\r\nsolution of nitrate of silver; this affects the outer layers of the\r\npearls, and, after its decomposition, the metallic silver is deposited,\r\nand they become absolutely black. The effect is sometimes hastened by\r\nexposing them to the fumes of nitrate of silver. These pearls are then\r\nrubbed up or slightly polished and may retain a good appearance for a\r\nnumber of years. The upper layers, however, which have been injured by\r\nthe chemicals used in the coloring, often scale off, and the poor and\r\nunattractive color beneath appears. This is sometimes not detected until\r\nyears after and when the dealer from whom they were purchased has been\r\nforgotten. The breaks or cracks which have been made can readily be\r\ndetected by means of a pocket lens, if the observer is at all\r\nexperienced. In many cases the outer layer of the pearl has been colored\r\na good black, although scarcely any crack is visible.\r\n\r\nFrequently, when a small knob or protuberance appears in the pearl, or\r\nwhen it has adhered to another pearl or to the shell itself, this\r\nprotuberance is polished off, and the pearl is drilled at this point.\r\nThis portion of the surface, however carefully polished, will never have\r\nthe true orient, but it is placed in the necklace in such a way that it\r\nis completely hidden. Often pearls become scratched through rough usage,\r\nor by the knife used in opening the shells. These are occasionally\r\npolished by means of pearl-powder, or else the entire outer layer is\r\nremoved, the new skin beneath appearing absolutely bright and perfect.\r\nIt sometimes happens that a pearl will have a good luster, but a\r\nslightly roughened skin. This is at times polished down; but an\r\nexperienced eye easily detects that it has been tampered with. Yellowish\r\npearls are sometimes bleached by means of strong bleaching substances\r\nsuch as chlorine or other powerful reagents, which, although they may\r\nwhiten the pearl, cause it to become very friable, as the animal\r\nsubstance becomes more brittle. Pearls treated in this way frequently\r\nwear off, layer by layer, until fully one half of the pearl is worn out\r\nof the setting. When pearls are stained yellowish from the exudations of\r\nthe skin, grease, or other impurities, they can be cleaned by putting\r\nthem in moist caustic magnesia and allowing it to dry on them. When this\r\nis removed, the pearls will often be found much purer in color than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIn various parts of the world certain dubious methods have been used for\r\nrestoring the beauty of pearls which have grown dim. In India they are\r\nrubbed in boiled rice. Some persons have even fed them to a chicken\r\nfastened in a coop; after the lapse of an hour or two the chicken is\r\nkilled, and the pearls rescued from their temporary lodging-place, where\r\nthey have been somewhat restored by the digestive juices of the fowl.\r\n\r\nSome curious tests applied to pearls are given us in a Hindu treatise on\r\ngems by Buddhabhatta. For instance, we read: “If the purchaser conceives\r\na doubt as to the genuineness of a pearl, let him place it during one\r\nnight in a mixture of water and oil with salt, and heat it. Or let him\r\nwrap it in a dry cloth and rub it with grains of rice; if it do not\r\nbecome discolored, it should be regarded as genuine.”[416] It is\r\nneedless to state that these tests would be either useless or injurious.\r\n\r\nIf the reader is the owner of a pearl or of a pearl necklace and feels\r\nthat the pearls need treatment, any attempt to follow the directions\r\ngiven by many ancient writers would infallibly result in their injury or\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nPearl drilling is a most delicate operation. It is necessary that the\r\ndrill points should have the proper shape,—that is, should not be too\r\ntapering, but slightly blunt at the end, and turning somewhat in a\r\nV-shape,—it is also important that the drill should be revolved with\r\nperfect regularity, so as not to jar or jolt the pearl, as this is\r\nlikely to lead to the cracking of the pearl or to the breaking of the\r\ndrill. This latter happens not infrequently, and is due either to the\r\nstructure of the pearl, the clogging of the drill, or to encountering a\r\nhard grain of sand inclosed in the pearl. Should the drill break in the\r\npearl, it can best be removed by drilling from a point directly\r\nopposite, and slowly forcing the broken drill outward. This process\r\nrequires great care in the regulation of the speed, and great exactness\r\nof direction in order to meet the broken drill accurately.\r\n\r\nPearl drilling was formerly a laborious process, and it was scarcely\r\npossible for a driller to perforate more than from forty to fifty pearls\r\nper day by means of the bow-drill operated by hand. Now, by the use of a\r\nmodern machine, 1500 pearls of average size can be drilled without any\r\ndifficulty in the same time.\r\n\r\nSome of the most successful drilling of fine pearls is done by means of\r\nthe bow- or fiddle-drill. The arm of this is made either of steel or of\r\nwood, with a strong cord stretched across it in the style of an archer’s\r\nbow. The drill is inserted in the end of a brass circular disk with a\r\nV-shaped groove on its edge, to admit of the string being passed\r\nentirely around it like a pulley, so that when the drill is placed on\r\nanything and held at the other side, and the bow is moved up and down,\r\nthe wheel with the drill-end rotates rapidly.\r\n\r\nIf the pearl is not properly secured, if the drill point is too\r\nirregular, if it is not properly centered, or if it is too rapidly\r\nrotated at the start, one or more layers of the pearl are likely to be\r\nbroken, giving an irregular, ragged appearance. If, again, the drill is\r\nrotated too rapidly as it is leaving the other side of the pearl, one or\r\nmore layers are occasionally forced off, and this in turn will produce a\r\nbreak on the pearl. It happens not infrequently that pearls are broken\r\naway on the surfaces at both drill holes if the workman is careless.\r\n\r\nAs pearls have become more valuable, only the most efficient workmen are\r\nemployed in drilling them. Whereas formerly a drill hole would be half a\r\nmillimeter in diameter, at present it is much smaller, and such drilling\r\nrequires the greatest skill in manipulation. The use of these very fine\r\ndrill holes is due principally to the fact that pearls have become so\r\nvaluable that the slightest loss, even the fraction of a grain, would\r\namount to a considerable sum in a necklace of large pearls.\r\n\r\nWhen a pearl has been perforated with a very fine drill hole, the hole\r\nmay be enlarged somewhat by using a slender copper wire, the fineness of\r\nthe drill hole itself, charged with either diamond-dust, emery, or sand.\r\nWhen the wire thus charged is drawn in and out, the drill hole can be\r\nenlarged to any desired size.\r\n\r\nA large pearl is held in the hand or secured in a wooden block, or else\r\nit is held in a small pair of forceps with a rounded, cup-shaped\r\nreceptacle at the end, which is usually lined with chamois leather and\r\nis pierced with a hole through the center. This hole serves as a guide\r\nfor the drill, directing it while the pearl is being perforated.\r\nAdjustable cups or forceps with cup-like ends of every size are\r\nnecessary, according to the size of the pearl; and in order that it may\r\nbe properly seen, it is requisite that the pearl should always be larger\r\nthan the cup in which it is placed.\r\n\r\nThe poorest part or spot is selected to form the beginning of the drill\r\nhole. The pearl is placed in a pair of calipers with a circular disk,\r\none end of the caliper being placed on the spot to be pierced, the other\r\nend naturally touching exactly opposite, the pearl absolutely centering\r\nit. As these caliper ends have been rubbed with either rouge, lampblack,\r\nor some colored substance that will readily rub off, these two spots of\r\ncolor remain on the pearl and serve as a guide for the driller. The\r\ndrill end is then placed on the pearl, and the bow moved up and down;\r\nand so rapid is this work that five pearls weighing fifteen grains each\r\ncan be drilled with the greatest care in less than one hour’s time. Of\r\nsmall pearls, weighing about one grain, as many as fifty have been\r\ndrilled in less than one hour by the hand-drill method.\r\n\r\nMany of the thinnest and best drills are made out of thin steel needles.\r\nThese are ground flat by means of a small carborundum wheel, so as to\r\nhave two flat sides. They are then thin pointed, and with a V-shaped\r\nedge. These prevent the drill from clogging up, allowing the fine dust\r\nto pass upward and outward readily, and the hard steel almost invariably\r\npenetrates the central core of the pearl, no matter how hard or tough\r\nthis may be. The needle-drill is then secured in a small chuck attached\r\nto the brass revolving wheel. Some recommend lubricating a drill with\r\nmilk when it is employed for piercing a pearl, but a well-made drill,\r\nthat allows the dust to escape as it is formed, does not require this\r\ntreatment. The drill should always be made to revolve quite slowly so\r\nthat no unnecessary heat may be generated by friction to injure the\r\ncolor of the pearl and also to avoid the possibility of the drill\r\nbecoming clogged by the pearl-dust.\r\n\r\nBy means of centering calipers or markers, the driller, especially in\r\nthe drilling of a large pearl, will generally drill first from one end,\r\nand then reverse the pearl and drill from the other end, meeting\r\nabsolutely in the center. This prevents the breaking of the outer layer\r\nof the pearl. A skilful workman can, by turning the pearl, so operate\r\nthe calipers that the true center can be obtained, even if the pearl is\r\nnot absolutely round, and the drill holes so centered that the\r\nirregularity of the pearl is less apparent.\r\n\r\nWhen the pearl has been half drilled through from one side, considerable\r\ncaution is necessary in drilling from the other, that when the two drill\r\nholes are about meeting the drill be not revolved too rapidly, as the\r\nclogging is likely to crack the pearl or break the drill. If the pearl\r\nis only to be drilled one fourth or one half through, the depth can\r\nalways be gaged by watching the drill-end, first, by measuring the\r\ndrill-end itself, and, secondly, by noting to what part of it\r\npearl-powder adheres.\r\n\r\nPearls are more easily manipulated than any other gems. They are also\r\nmore easily damaged. Still, when properly treated by the workman, there\r\nis no material that offers him more satisfactory results than the pearl,\r\nif good judgment be used.\r\n\r\nDrillers occasionally find that when the drill reaches the center of the\r\npearl, there is a sharp click, the pearl often breaking at this point.\r\nThis is evidently due to the fact that a harder kernel may exist in the\r\ncenter, such as a tiny grain of sand, which can turn the drill point; or\r\nelse the resistance may cause the tiny drill to break.\r\n\r\nWhen a pearl is cracked by a blow or by some accident, it is customary\r\nto drill it at the end of the largest crack; this method prevents the\r\ncrack from extending in that direction. These fissures are sometimes\r\npartly filled by means of a solution, and may not be visible at the time\r\nwhen the pearl is bought, but they are liable to appear later.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the difference in the care used in drilling, we have\r\nselected eight pearls from a paper of poor ones, and reproduce two views\r\nof them, one to show the irregularity of the pearls, and the other to\r\nshow the varying size of the drill holes. Those on the left were drilled\r\nby an artist, while those on the right show the work of an inexperienced\r\ndriller.\r\n\r\nAt present pendant pearls are never drilled entirely through, and rarely\r\nmore than half way. But in the Orient, and even in Europe from the\r\nfourteenth to the sixteenth century, they were often entirely pierced;\r\neven pear-shaped pearls were entirely drilled through, with a metal edge\r\nprojected below for safety. Frequently old pearls, and more especially\r\noriental pearls, have been entirely drilled through, as are often large\r\noriental rubies, diamonds, and sapphires. When these are set, the holes\r\nare either plugged with pearl shell and polished smooth, or a tiny ruby\r\nor diamond is set in a metal rim fitting entirely into the drill hole or\r\nonly slightly projecting. This is well instanced in the portrait of\r\nMarguerite of France (1553–1615), in which the artist Delpech shows all\r\nthe pear-shaped pearls worn by the French queen entirely pierced.\r\n\r\nFrequently, where pearls have been drilled by oriental workmen, the\r\ndrill holes are exceedingly large, five or six times the width of the\r\nsilk string; in fact often from one to two millimeters in diameter. In\r\nthe search to supply the great demand, many oriental pearls have been\r\nsecured which formerly were strung to an oriental jewel by means of a\r\nthick wire; it is necessary to close this aperture, as the pearl would\r\nlie unevenly on the string. This is done by introducing a\r\nmother-of-pearl plug, through which a new drill hole is made. Unless the\r\npearls are unstrung, this is rarely visible; but not infrequently the\r\nplug drops out. In other cases the pearl has been drilled not only from\r\nend to end, but also from the side, and this third hole is filled with a\r\nplug of mother-of-pearl and polished over so as to hide the blemish from\r\nthe buyer. It is also no uncommon thing for a purchaser to find, after a\r\nyear, that cracks begin to develop where none apparently existed at the\r\ntime of his purchase, or they were so minute as to be considered of no\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest references to drilling pearls was made by Rugerus, a\r\nmonk who lived in the eleventh century. He says:\r\n\r\n  Pearls are found in the sea-shell and shells of other waters; these\r\n  are perforated with a fine steeled instrument which is fixed in\r\n  wood, having a small wheel of lead, also another wood in which it\r\n  may be turned, to which a strap must be placed by which it may be\r\n  revolved. But should it be necessary that the aperture of any pearl\r\n  be made larger, a wire may be placed in the opening with a little\r\n  fine sand, one end of which may be held in the teeth, the other in\r\n  the left hand, and by the right the pearl is conducted upwards and\r\n  downwards, and in the meantime sand is applied, that the apertures\r\n  may become wider. Sea-shells are also cut into pieces and are filed\r\n  as pearls, sufficiently useful upon gold, and they are polished as\r\n  above.[417]\r\n\r\nIn “The Toy Cart,” a Hindu drama by Sudrake, who lived about the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era, there is a description of a jeweler’s\r\nworkshop attached to the house of a courtezan. He says: “Some set rubies\r\nin gold, some string gold beads on colored thread, some string pearls,\r\nsome grind lapis lazuli, some cut shells and some grind and pierce\r\ncoral.”[418]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese and Korean method of drilling pearls differs materially from\r\nthat of the Occident. A pear-shaped pearl is frequently drilled\r\nhorizontally and secured by wire or silk, and not drilled\r\nperpendicularly, as with us, to have a metal wire or peg fastened into\r\nit. If the orientals drill a pearl perpendicularly, the hole is\r\ngenerally carried entirely through it, and a gold knot, which is used as\r\na bead, is placed at the lower end, and sometimes a tiny gem is set in\r\nthis peg, or else the pearl is secured either by some projection below,\r\nor by means of a bit of enamel, or some other object may be attached to\r\nthe gold or wire below it. Button pearls, especially those of the\r\nabalone, are drilled horizontally through the base and secured to the\r\nornament, or to the silk or other material on which they are sewed, by\r\nmeans of a thread or wire; or else they may be drilled from below by\r\nmeans of two sloping holes forming a V, the thread or wire being passed\r\nupward until it strikes the angle, and then passed outward again through\r\nthe other branch of the hole. Many fine, round, and pear-shaped pearls\r\nof oriental origin may be seen with this end closed either with a speck\r\nof pearl, a diamond, or a ruby.\r\n\r\nA most interesting and careful description of the methods of drilling\r\npearls was given by James Cordiner in his valuable volume, “A\r\nDescription of Ceylon,” published in London in 1807, pages 64–66.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Scraping ends of silk threads for stringing pearl necklace\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Stringing a pearl collar in sections; cleaning and reaming out a pearl\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Sliding a pearl along the string in pearl stringing\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Tying a knot between pearls in pearl stringing\r\n]\r\n\r\n                            PEARL STRINGING\r\n\r\n  The next operation which claims attention is the drilling of the\r\n  pearls. I neglected to inspect this part of the business; but have\r\n  been informed that much admiration is excited, both by the dexterity\r\n  of the artist, and the rude simplicity of the machinery which he\r\n  employs. A block of wood, of the form of an inverted cone, is raised\r\n  upon three feet about twelve inches from the ground. Small holes or\r\n  pits of various sizes are cut in the upper flat surface, for the\r\n  reception of the pearls. The driller sits on his haunches close to\r\n  this machine, which is called a vadeagrum. The pearls are driven\r\n  steady into their sockets by a piece of iron with flat sides, about\r\n  one inch and a half in length. A well tempered needle is fixed in a\r\n  reed five inches long, with an iron point at the other end, formed\r\n  to play in the socket of a cocoanut shell, which presses on the\r\n  forehead of the driller. A bow is formed of a piece of bamboo and a\r\n  string. The workman brings his right knee in a line with the\r\n  vadeagrum, and places on it a small cup, formed of part of a\r\n  cocoanut shell, which is filled with water to moderate the heat of\r\n  friction. He bends his head over the machine, and applying the point\r\n  of the needle to a pearl sunk in one of the pits, drills with great\r\n  facility, every now and then dexterously dipping the little finger\r\n  of his right hand in the water, and applying it to the needle,\r\n  without impeding the operation. In this manner he bores a pearl in\r\n  the space of two or three minutes; and in the course of a day\r\n  perforates three hundred small or six hundred large pearls. The\r\n  needle is frequently sharpened with oil on a stone slab, and\r\n  sometimes, before the operation is performed, is heated in the flame\r\n  of a lamp.\r\n\r\n  The large pearls are generally drilled first, in order to bring the\r\n  hand in to work with more ease on those of a smaller size; and\r\n  pearls less than a grain of mustard-seed are pierced with little\r\n  difficulty.\r\n\r\n  After the pearls have been drilled, they must be immediately washed\r\n  in salt and water, to prevent the stains which would otherwise be\r\n  occasioned by the perforating instrument.\r\n\r\nA quaint description of pearl drilling was given by Anselmus de Boot in\r\n1609.[419]\r\n\r\n  Since all are not aware of the manner in which pearls are\r\n  perforated, I wish here to give an account of the method. The\r\n  handle. A, is held with the left hand, and then the handle, B, of\r\n  the bow is pushed back and forth with the right hand, so that there\r\n  is a reciprocal movement of the lance AC. The extreme end, C, has a\r\n  needle, not so sharp as to come to a point, but slightly blunted.\r\n  The needle is placed on the pearl which is to be perforated. If the\r\n  pearls are too small to be held, they are fastened in the case, D,\r\n  with a small hammer of soft wood, lest they should slip. The board\r\n  is inclosed on every side by strips of wood so that the water which\r\n  comes from the pearls shall not flow off. The bow being moved, the\r\n  needle penetrates and pierces the pearl and it is not corroded by\r\n  the water.\r\n\r\nA mythical story, but a pleasant one, is told of a great pearl collector\r\nwho had owned a wonderful pear-shaped pearl for many years and had\r\nabsolutely failed to find any match for it. After years of fruitless\r\nsearch he was at last rewarded by finding an absolutely perfect mate. He\r\ntook this to his favorite jeweler in one of the great capitals of\r\nEurope, and ordered the new gem to be pierced to match the other so that\r\nboth could be set. The jeweler called a small German boy from an\r\nadjoining workshop, simply saying, “Jakey, drill this pearl to match the\r\nother.” The collector was dumfounded that no caution should be given to\r\nthe boy when so important a piece of work was intrusted to his care.\r\nScarcely had the boy left the room when the collector inquired of the\r\njeweler, almost in consternation, “How can you trust so valuable a pearl\r\nto so small a boy without a word of caution?” To this the dealer\r\nreplied: “Jakey is the most careful pearl driller I have ever known. I\r\nknow that there will be no failure in the drilling. I have never\r\ncautioned him about such work. He never has drilled a pearl wrong. Had I\r\nwarned him of the value of the gem or told him how important a piece of\r\nwork he was doing, he probably would have become nervous and, as a\r\nresult, your pearl would have been cracked.” The conversation had\r\nscarcely been completed before Jakey returned with the pearl as\r\nbeautifully drilled as the original one which it matched.\r\n\r\nIn the Orient and elsewhere, when it is considered desirable to mount a\r\npearl so that it shall not turn, especially when only one part of the\r\npearl is perfect and that is to remain outside, the drill hole is\r\nsometimes made square, that is to say, drilled round and then reamed out\r\nwith a small saw until it becomes square, when a square wire is\r\ninserted; or else the pearl is first drilled with a tiny round hole and\r\nthis is then reamed out until it is triangular, when a triangular wire\r\nis introduced. This method is sometimes used for studs or ring-settings.\r\n\r\nIn setting pearls with points or claws on the wire or band of a ring,\r\nthe pearls are drilled only half way through. A gold pin is then\r\ninserted, and sometimes a thread is cut into the pearl itself; it is\r\nsecured by means of gum mastic or some other strong gum. Occasionally,\r\nto add greater strength, a side pin is put in, so that the pearl is\r\ndrilled with two bits of metal, which penetrate the one side in a\r\nperfectly straight line and the other at an angle of about twenty-five\r\nor thirty degrees (this is called side-pegging). This gives more\r\nstrength and firmness to the pearl itself, and prevents it from twisting\r\nor twining and becoming loose. Sometimes the pearl hole is drilled so\r\nthat the opening is that of a screw-thread, in order to hold it to the\r\nearring, the stud, or the ring. The gold pin which is inserted to attach\r\nthe pearl to the ring or stud has a screw-thread also, and the peg or\r\npin is screwed on as well as secured.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious method, termed “keying,” for securing the peg in pearls to\r\nbe set on rings or studs, consists in drilling a hole half through the\r\npearl and then two smaller holes or grooves on each side of the first.\r\nCutting tools of a T-shape are now introduced into the aperture and\r\nworked about until the pearl is undercut all around, so that when a peg\r\nwith a cross-piece is inserted, the latter can be turned within the\r\npearl until it sets at right angles with the widest part of the\r\naperture. In this way the peg is permanently secured and cannot slip\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe fact that in recent years more pearls have appeared in necklaces\r\nthat are irregularly bored, that the bore holes are so large that they\r\nare plugged with mother-of-pearl, or that one meets with pearls in which\r\na plug has been placed in the side immediately in the center between the\r\ntwo drill holes, is due to the fact that the great demand has resulted\r\nin the destruction of many oriental ornaments in which the pearls were\r\ndrilled in various ways, as well as in the destruction of the different\r\nMagyar and other semi-official jewels of eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe most primitive known drills were the flint drills, made by the North\r\nAmerican Indians by chipping chert or flint-like minerals to a fine\r\npoint. With these rude instruments a large, irregular hole was made,\r\nwhich generally measured several times the diameter of the fine drill\r\nhole made by a modern pearl driller with an improved drill. The Indians\r\nare also said to have used hot copper drills for boring holes.\r\n\r\nThe earliest, and still a very general and perhaps the best way of\r\ndrilling pearls, is by means of the bow- or fiddle-drill. This method\r\nhas been used in a more or less perfected form by all the aboriginal\r\npeoples of the New World from Iceland to Tierra del Fuego. But as none\r\nof these peoples were familiar with fine, hard steel, they scarcely ever\r\nsucceeded in making drill holes as fine as those that can be produced by\r\nthe use of tempered steel. By the latter means, pearls half an inch in\r\ndiameter are often drilled entirely through with an aperture no larger\r\nthan a thin bit of straw.\r\n\r\nThe largest and finest pearls are frequently drilled with the smallest\r\nholes, as the slightest loss in weight means a diminution in value.\r\nThen, too, a pearl with a small drill hole is not so liable to shift on\r\nthe string, and thus is less likely to cut the silk thread which holds\r\nthe pearls together.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to enumerate all the tricks to which some jewelers\r\nnow resort in order to utilize every fragment of a pearl they can lay\r\ntheir hands on. Some of them are wonderfully clever at reconstruction,\r\nbut to the woman who loves pearls, nothing can take the place of the\r\nsoft, beautiful, round gem, with its natural surface.\r\n\r\nIn sorting pearls for the smaller necklaces, it is customary to open up\r\na number of dozen bunches of the East Indian pearls as they are sent\r\nfrom the East, strung, the ends fastened together in bunches, and then\r\nsealed. These pearls are placed on a table and are first arranged\r\naccording to color and luster on the sorting board. They are then\r\ngrouped according to size and graduation, the greatest care being\r\nexercised in the selection for color, luster, and form. In this way ten\r\nnecklaces may be re-strung into ten others, the necklaces probably being\r\nimproved as regards selection, or else better arranged for the uses to\r\nwhich the jeweler wishes to put them.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the larger necklaces, it frequently requires many years\r\nof selection and arrangement before one becomes perfect enough to pass\r\nthe criticism or suit the fancy of the jeweler.\r\n\r\nWe have no record as to when the first pearl necklace was strung, nor\r\nhave we a definite record of the first use of silk for stringing a\r\nnecklace. The earliest illustration that we have been able to obtain of\r\nthe use of pearls in the form of a necklace is the one from Susa, in\r\nwhich the pearls were secured with gold. A Syrian necklace, dating about\r\none or two centuries before Christ, was strung by means of a bronze\r\nwire. We will endeavor to give a few facts on the interesting process of\r\npreparing pearls for wearing.\r\n\r\nPearl stringing is an art, easy as the process may seem, and it is\r\ninteresting to note the precision, care, and delicacy with which the\r\npearl stringer performs his task. The first step is to grade the pearls\r\naccording to their size and color, so that they may produce the best\r\npossible effect. The largest and finest pearl is placed in the center;\r\nalongside of this, on each side, are laid the two pearls next in size\r\nwhich are the most nearly alike in form and hue; and so on to the end of\r\nthe necklace. This grouping requires both experience and judgment, and\r\nis of great importance, since the value of the pearls is often\r\nconsiderably enhanced by a proper arrangement. A skilful stringer is\r\nable to grade them so cleverly that only a trifling difference will be\r\nfound in the weight of the two halves of a necklace.\r\n\r\nThe stringing process consists in securing the end pearl by a knot to\r\nthe diamond, pearl, or other clasp which may be used. When a necklace is\r\nbeing strung, the thread is passed through the metal eye, or pearl, or\r\nother object that serves as a clasp. It is then tied with one knot,\r\npassed through the next pearl, and knotted between that and the second\r\npearl, and sometimes between the second and the third, thus making the\r\njoint doubly secure. The other pearls are then strung in their order, a\r\nknot being placed after each fifth, fourth, third, or second pearl, or,\r\nshould there not be enough to give a proper length to the necklace,\r\nbetween each single pearl. The deftness with which the knot is tied so\r\nas not to hold the pearl too tightly, and risk the breaking of the\r\nthread, and the precision with which forty, fifty, and even sometimes\r\nseveral hundred knots are made on a single string, is a pleasing\r\noperation to witness, and requires the greatest care and nicety of\r\ntouch. If knots are made frequently between the pearls, there is less\r\ndanger of losing them should the thread break, as only one or two can\r\nfall off; sometimes, indeed, when the drill holes are very small, the\r\nsilk thread, waxed or unwaxed, fits so closely that the pearl does not\r\nbecome detached even when the thread breaks.\r\n\r\nThe thread used is invariably of silk of the highest standard of purity,\r\nstrength, and texture, undyed, and not containing any chemicals. Two or\r\nthree of these threads are held together, then with a knife the edges\r\nare very carefully scraped till the combined material of the three\r\nthreads is less than the thickness of one. Some use a needle to scrape\r\nor fray to a sharp point. Then this point is stiffened by means of\r\n“white glue,” the best material of this kind being pure gum arabic\r\ndissolved in water. A little of this is rubbed on the pointed threads.\r\nIt stiffens in a moment, then the pearls are passed on, one after the\r\nother. If the pearls to be strung are already on a necklace, this\r\nprocess is simplified by the unknotting of the end of the necklace to be\r\nre-strung; two or three of the pearls are slid on to the new string, the\r\nends or points of the new necklace thread are twisted together with the\r\nold ends and the pearls are simply transferred.\r\n\r\nFrequently the holes have been drilled so as to leave the rims rather\r\nsharp; in this way the thread may be frayed out or even cut. This sharp\r\nedge can easily be removed by careful reaming. Silk of pure quality is\r\nthe best material known for stringing pearls. A series of experiments\r\nwere made with every available fiber of sufficient durability from every\r\nquarter of the globe, but silk alone was found to possess the strength,\r\nthe flexibility, and the smoothness necessary to permit a very fine set\r\nof threads to pass through an opening as small as the drill hole of a\r\npearl. In the case of a long chain or sautoire, more than three hundred\r\npearls will be strung on a single row, one of over eighty inches in\r\nlength containing over three hundred pearls, and it requires a degree of\r\nneatness and patience that few possess to do this in exactly the right\r\nway, so that the thread may not be cut, that the pearls may not be too\r\ntightly strung, and that the ends shall be carefully attached at the\r\nclasp, so that the necklace may hang well and there may be no danger of\r\nthe ends breaking loose.\r\n\r\nAccording to the frequency with which it is worn, a necklace should be\r\nre-strung every three, six, or twelve months. The proper time for\r\nre-stringing can generally be determined by the stretching of the thread\r\nso that it can be seen either between the pearls or at either end,\r\ngiving the impression that one or more pearls are missing. A newly\r\nstrung necklace is taut.\r\n\r\nWhere a collar is from thirteen to fourteen inches in length, there are\r\nfrequently twenty-three rows of pearls, kept straight by four jeweled\r\nbars, and sometimes from ten to twenty-five pearls in a section between\r\na bar. This would mean that there are more than two thousand pearls in a\r\ncollar of small pearls. When one considers that at each bar and at the\r\ncatch and clasp of the collar it is necessary to make a knotting, it is\r\nnot surprising that it requires from three to four days’ time of a very\r\nexpert pearl stringer to string or re-string such a pearl collar. A\r\nsplendid example of such a twenty-three-row collar is that belonging to\r\nSeñora Diaz, wife of the President of the Republic of Mexico.[420]\r\n\r\nFrequent stringing may sometimes serve as a protection for pearls, as,\r\nif wax is used, the drill hole is likely to become coated with wax from\r\nthe thread, and this prevents the absorption by the pearl of\r\nperspiration or moisture of any kind through the thread. Indeed, the\r\nthread itself, when waxed, does not readily absorb moisture, and as the\r\ninterior of the pearl also becomes waxed, this serves to protect it from\r\nthe absorption of humidity of any kind.\r\n\r\nIn making pearl necklets or muff-chains, a piece of gold wire of the\r\nproper strength and pliability is taken. This wire is passed through the\r\nhole of the pearl and then cleverly bent into a loop on each side and\r\nfirmly soldered. It is important that the wire should be very slightly\r\nsmaller than the dimension of the hole in the pearl so that it may fit\r\nclosely. Sometimes, instead of this method, a ring is soldered to one\r\nend of the wire before this is passed through the pearl, the other end\r\nbeing then secured in the manner described above. Still another method\r\nis occasionally employed; in this a piece of the wire is bent into a\r\nring, but not quite closed, the aperture being just large enough to\r\nadmit the wire that has traversed the pearl; in this way the wire can be\r\nintroduced into the opening in the ring, which grips it tightly, and is\r\nthen soldered to it. In many cases two small rings are strung on the\r\nwire on each side of the pearl before the loops are made, so that they\r\ninterpose between the latter and the pearl itself. This serves to\r\nprotect the sides of the pearl, as there is otherwise some danger that\r\nthe hole may become chipped or ragged; the same result can be obtained\r\nif small caps, closely fitting the pearl, are used instead of the rings.\r\nThis is, however, only possible when the pearl is quite round, and in\r\nthis case the effect produced is often very attractive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NECKLACE OF SEED-PEARLS. UNITED STATES. CIVIL WAR PERIOD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nMany of the pearls set as rings and studs are no longer set in points,\r\nbut are set upon a peg, or are “pegged,” as it is termed. Setting a\r\npearl in claws generally hides more than one half of the entire sphere.\r\nBut if the pearl is not properly secured upon the peg, it will\r\noccasionally fall off. However, this can be obviated to a great extent\r\nby attaching the pearl to a double peg which keeps it from turning and\r\nalso prevents its falling off. Pearls have occasionally been damaged\r\nwith the shellac used, or when the gold peg on which the pearl is placed\r\nwas too hot.\r\n\r\nIn mounting very small pearls as link chains so as to form a continuous\r\npearly rope without any break in the way of gold links, occasionally\r\nV-shaped cavities are drilled into each end of the pearl, and the\r\nsetting itself is hidden in this V-shaped cavity. This is only done\r\nwhere the pearls are small and not of great value.\r\n\r\nThe jeweler, in setting pearls, must use the greatest possible care,\r\nfirst, in cutting away the settings, as they are fastened to the pearl,\r\nnot to scratch or mar it; and then, when he files the settings, not to\r\nallow the file to touch the pearl, as both the steel tool and the file\r\nwould injure it. He must particularly avoid placing the pearl too close\r\nto a diamond, ruby, or other precious stone; for, even if the pearl only\r\nslightly touches the gem against which it is set, a knock of the hand\r\nmay mar the pearl’s surface. More especially, as pearls are set at\r\npresent, “pegged” and without points, it is of the greatest importance\r\nthat they be worn in such a way that they may not touch the unexposed\r\nedges of any precious stones, as this also would injure the pearls. For\r\nlack of this precaution fine pearls have frequently been harmed.\r\n\r\nA large jewelry firm has under consideration the following pearl order:\r\nAny workman who in any way mutilates a pearl by filing, imperfect\r\ndrilling or shaping, or in any way affects the shape of a pearl, without\r\nthe authority of the foreman, will be called upon to pay for the same.\r\n\r\nAs pearls are natural objects, any change of the same to fit the\r\nsetting, or for attachment to any gold object, mutilates the gem and\r\ngreatly affects its value. If belonging to a customer, this frequently\r\nmeans its replacement, often at a great cost to the jeweler.\r\n\r\nPearl “blisters” frequently have the appearance of being empty; they are\r\ngenerally filled with a fluid, either water or the product of animal and\r\nvegetable decomposition. These contents usually emit a peculiar and\r\nunpleasant odor. As the exterior of the inclosure gradually wears away\r\nand disappears, the contents of the blister are slowly absorbed by the\r\nshell itself, and any organic or insoluble substances are deposited on\r\nits inner surface.\r\n\r\nThus, when a shell shows any protuberance on this surface, the peeler\r\nwill cut or scrape away a portion of the decaying shell behind the spot.\r\nShould he discover the hole of a borer, he lays the shell aside; but if\r\nhe finds it to be perfect at this spot, it is evident that the inclusion\r\ncame from within, and frequently it turns out to be an included pearl.\r\nThis is removed by breaking the shell, or by cutting around the\r\nprotuberance very near to its edge, and then breaking away the shell.\r\nThe pearl is often visible, and layer after layer of the covering mass\r\nis removed with the greatest care by the peeler, who is rewarded by\r\nbringing to light pearls of various qualities, and frequently those of\r\ngreat value.\r\n\r\nAn instance in which, by opening a pearl blister, the speculator\r\nreceived a good reward is given by Streeter, who says: “The _Harriet_\r\nhad the good luck to find, in 1882, a pearl 103 grains in weight, which\r\nwas inclosed in a huge blister. It was a fine _bouton_, of splendid\r\ncolor in the upper portion, but a trifle chalky below. This was\r\nattributed to the admission of salt water into the shell through a hole\r\nmade by a borer which happened to pierce the shell just where the pearl\r\nlay, and had penetrated the latter for almost a quarter of an inch.”\r\n\r\nSometimes pearl masses are hollow. Barbot[421] mentions that a French\r\nmerchant residing in Mexico, having bought one of these pieces from a\r\nfisherman at a low price, resolved to satisfy his curiosity by finding\r\nout what was inside. He split it in two parts and was agreeably\r\nsurprised to find a pearl weighing 14¼ carats (57 grains), so round, of\r\nsuch good water, and such fine orient, that he sold it in Paris for\r\nnearly 5000 francs ($1000) in 1850.\r\n\r\nSeed-pearl work was introduced into the United States, about seventy\r\nyears ago, by Henry Dubosq, who had studied the methods employed in\r\nEurope and has been succeeded in this industry by his son, Augustus\r\nDubosq. The father bought a large quantity of English seed-pearl\r\njewelry, brought it to this country, and hired a number of girls to take\r\nit apart carefully and re-string it with white horsehair, to learn how\r\nit was made. With no more teaching, he established an industry that has\r\nalready lasted for three score and ten years.\r\n\r\nSeed-pearl jewelry was most in vogue from the year 1840 to 1860. It was\r\ngenerally sold in sets, in a case consisting of a collar, two bracelets,\r\ntwo earrings, a small brooch, and a large spray or corsage ornament. If\r\nthe object was almost round, occasionally there was a larger central\r\npearl, weighing from one to five grains, usually a button pearl; or, if\r\nthe ornament was elongated, there were generally three larger pearls.\r\nThese sometimes possessed a fairly good luster. Seed-pearl jewelry was\r\nat one time so popular, and the values were so small in this country,\r\nthat a $1000 seed-pearl set formed a principal feature of the Tiffany\r\nexhibit at the International Exposition held at the Crystal Palace, New\r\nYork, in 1855.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MOTHER-OF-PEARL SHELL FROM TAHITI\r\n\r\n  Illustration of a mother-of-pearl shell, showing where a blister has\r\n    been cut out. In this instance a large pear-shaped pearly blister\r\n    appeared almost in the center of the shell. A dealer removed this by\r\n    means of a saw, and was surprised to find that the mother-of-pearl,\r\n    instead of remaining intact, parted in two pieces. Between these two\r\n    pieces was a mass of green and white calcareous matter. The two\r\n    upper figures show the pearly side and the outside of the shell\r\n    whence the blister was cut. The figures below show the inside and\r\n    outside of each half of the blister and the earthy matter inclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A is the pearl sawn from the shell.\r\n\r\n  B is the piece of pearl that parted from the back of this pearly mass.\r\n\r\n  C and F are two views of the included calcareous matter.\r\n\r\n  D is the reverse of A, showing the cavity.\r\n\r\n  E is the reverse of B; originally A rested on B.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There was no indication of any hollow space, or that the mass was not\r\n    perfect.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSeed-pearl tiaras sell for from $75 to $200 or $300 each. The work is\r\nalmost entirely done by girls, either German or of German origin. As\r\nlabor is higher and pearls have advanced in price, none of the old work\r\ncould now be duplicated for the amount it cost twenty or thirty years\r\nago. The stringing of the pearls on the English scroll means probably\r\ntwelve hours of continuous work. An efficient pearl worker receives\r\n$3.50 a day, which consists of not more than eight hours, as, owing to\r\nthe very trying character of the work, clear daylight is necessary to\r\nsee the holes in the small pearls and in the mother-of-pearl shell.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of all seed-pearl work is mother-of-pearl. The shell is\r\nbrought in thin plates, measuring from one and one half to two and one\r\nhalf inches square. One of the most popular and attractive patterns is\r\nthe English scroll. If a design is to be repeated, a brass figure is\r\nmade. For the fabrication of a brooch, for instance, a design is first\r\nmade by drawing on a paper or cardboard; then a brass plate or pattern\r\nis cut out, leaving spaces wherever there are to be no pearls. After\r\nthis a slab of stock mother-of-pearl, nearest the size of the brass\r\nplate, is selected, and is sawn out, using the brass plate as a guide\r\nfor the outlines. The mother-of-pearl is then pierced wherever a pearl\r\nis to be secured, and the pearls for its embellishment are chosen, and\r\nare strung onto the mother-of-pearl outlines with a special horsehair\r\nthread. All the work that remains for the jeweler is the addition of a\r\npin or catch on the back. A representation is given of the designs, the\r\nbrass plate, the mother-of-pearl, the horsehair, the pearls, and the\r\ncompleted brooch made by this model.\r\n\r\nFine horsehair is used for stringing seed-pearls, because the holes\r\ndrilled in them are usually too small to admit of the use of silk, and\r\nit is very important that what is known as pulled hair, taken from a\r\nliving horse, should be used, as otherwise the hair is too brittle. This\r\nhair, in bunches of from eight to fourteen inches in length, is sold at\r\nan average price of $1.50 a pound, and frequently only one ounce is\r\nselected for use from the entire pound.\r\n\r\nAll the pearls used by the seed-pearl workers are purchased in strings\r\nand bunches; the finest are those known as the Chinese seed-pearls; they\r\nare drilled and strung in bunches, weighing three ounces, and are worth\r\n$40 an ounce. They are drilled with so fine an aperture that silk will\r\nnot pass through the pearl, and only horsehair can be used. The Indian\r\nMadras pearls, however, have a larger drill hole and can be strung with\r\nsilk; they are at present worth from eight to fifteen cents a grain,\r\nthat is, $48 to $90 per ounce.\r\n\r\nImmense quantities of these very minute pearls are also used in bunches\r\nor strings, sometimes as many as twenty or thirty strings being grouped\r\ntogether and either bound straight or else twisted into veritable ropes\r\nof pearls.\r\n\r\nSeed-pearls are sold by the ounce, a single ounce frequently containing\r\nas many as 9000,—that is, fifteen pearls to the pearl grain or sixty to\r\nthe carat,—selling for from $48 to $60 an ounce. Naturally, some of\r\nthese pearls are even smaller than this, but the average is maintained\r\nby those that are a little larger.\r\n\r\nPearls as small as 100 to a diamond carat are drilled and used in\r\nseed-pearl work. Diamonds, rubies, and even sapphires, however, are cut\r\nin brilliant form when they are as small as 250 to 300 to the carat, or\r\n45,000 to the ounce. The price of these small pearls, however, is only\r\nfrom eight to fifteen cents per carat, whereas diamonds of this size are\r\nworth from $200 to $300, their value being three times that of those\r\nweighing one sixteenth to one eighth carat each. This is due to the fact\r\nthat the labor expended in cutting the smaller diamonds is much greater\r\nthan that bestowed upon the pearls, which simply require drilling and\r\nnot cutting.\r\n\r\n“Half-pearl,” as we have mentioned, is the name given to such pearls as\r\nare round and spherically domed and are either somewhat flat or almost\r\nthe shape of one half of a whole pearl of the same diameter. They are\r\nproduced in two ways: some are cut away as hemispheres from the inner\r\nsurface of the shell of the pearl-mussel, but more usually they are the\r\nbetter portions of defective whole pearls which are sawn or split by\r\nhand into two “halves” with a minute saw, the defective part being\r\nrejected altogether or classified as inferior half-pearl, while the\r\nbetter half is classified as a I or II quality half-pearl. Frequently a\r\nfine specimen is obtained from an elongated pearl, and sometimes two,\r\nthree, or even four half-pearls are secured from the various bright\r\nparts of a round pearl. In splitting half-pearls, the pearl to be\r\noperated upon is held by hand in a kind of grooved vice or pincers and\r\nsawn through with a very fine saw; this process is at once simple,\r\nrapid, and of insignificant cost.\r\n\r\nOnly pearls which cannot be cut are filed. In this process the poorer\r\nside of the pearl in question is laid upon the file, and the operator\r\ntakes a piece of ordinary hard wood, so formed that he can grasp it\r\nfirmly in his hand, presses it down upon the pearl, and rubs the latter\r\non the file, removing all but the good side. In this way a half-pearl is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThe smaller half-pearls are from .5 to .75 millimeters in diameter, and\r\nan ordinary ounce of half-pearl material will number 18,000. Of the\r\nmanufactured half-pearls there are, on an average, 20,528 to an ounce.\r\n\r\nThe half-pearl industry is largely carried on in Idar, on the Nahe\r\nRiver, and in Oberstein, in the Duchy of Oldenburg, Germany. The pearls\r\nare usually purchased from London or Paris houses in lots valued up to\r\n$12,000 or more, although some of the firms buy directly from India. In\r\nIdar about one hundred people are employed in this industry. Frequently\r\nit is pursued m the home of the manufacturer, who may employ from one to\r\na dozen or more workers. These generally include a sorter or arranger,\r\nand a marker to indicate the part of the pearl which should be sawn off.\r\nThere is also a trimmer or one who finally adjusts the pearls.\r\n\r\nAn unusually clever bit of deception was practised by an American pearl\r\nfisher who had found two pearl blisters of almost identical size. Both\r\nof these blisters were hollow, and were alike in form. The pearl dealer\r\nvery cleverly polished down both sides, rounded off the edges, cemented\r\nthe two backs together, and except for a tiny edge they had all the\r\nappearance of a drop pearl that was fairly perfect on both sides. It\r\nrequired but a little heating to separate the parts and show the\r\ndeception.\r\n\r\nIn setting half-pearls, they are generally selected from large lots with\r\ngreat care as to their being of uniform size. A circular place for the\r\nsetting is often drilled with a steel drill, either for several or for a\r\nsingle one. The half-pearl is frequently placed on one or more tiny\r\ndisks of paper, to give it the exact height in the setting, and the edge\r\nof gold is rubbed up against the pearl, which is thus secured in its\r\nplace; or else tiny edges of gold are left projecting between each\r\npearl. These are pressed down after the pearl is in place. This process\r\nrequires great delicacy and skill and is frequently employed in the\r\ndecoration of pearl lockets and watches. In some of the cheaper work,\r\nthe half-pearls are cemented into the shallow disks that were drilled\r\nfor them, but frequently they are secured by metal points skilfully\r\nraised out of the disks in which the pearls are set, and then pressed\r\ndown to hold the latter in place. Although apparently frailly set, it is\r\nsurprising that half-pearl ornaments have been owned for more than a\r\ncentury, scarcely a pearl dropping out; and even if one or two pearls\r\nshould be lost from the piece of jewelry, the expense of replacing them\r\nis not very great. They are often not as safely set when they are\r\nmounted with diamonds, rubies, or other stones, more especially in\r\nrounded rings or bracelets.\r\n\r\nIn drilling gold for the setting of half-pearls, where the hole must not\r\nbe carried right through the metal, a so-called “pearl drill” is used.\r\nThis is designed to cut a hole with a flat base in comparatively thin\r\nlayers of metal without disfiguring the opposite side, a task that can\r\neasily be accomplished if care be taken not to drill deeper than is\r\nstrictly necessary for the safe adjustment of the pearl. For the\r\nconstruction of this drill a piece of round steel wire of suitable size\r\nis chosen; this is hammered flat at one end and then filed away at each\r\nside, leaving a small spike standing in the center, which projects a\r\nlittle beyond the cutting edges and acts as a pivot on which the drill\r\nrevolves. The steel on both sides of this spike is filed down to a fine\r\nedge, care being taken to preserve the horizontal line, so that when the\r\nspike is embedded in the metal both cutting edges come into play\r\nsimultaneously. If the drill is in good condition, it does its work very\r\nrapidly, since it is used in an upright drill-stock, whose weight gives\r\na uniform and constant pressure. A good range of sizes of this drill\r\nshould be kept ready for use, so that one may be found to suit the\r\ndimensions of any given pearl. This is essential in order to make an\r\nopening just large enough to hold the gem, so that it may fit tightly,\r\nwithout the necessity of reaming out the hole.\r\n\r\nHalf-pearls were frequently used with the most pleasing effect in the\r\ndecoration of antique watches. A number of remarkable examples of this\r\ntype are among the collection of antique watches of Henry Walters of\r\nBaltimore. This collection had been acquired by Tiffany & Co. after the\r\nsale of the San Donato Palace, the watches having been withdrawn from\r\nthe prince’s collection by his sister sometime before the sale.\r\n\r\nIn mounting pearls on gold, a white paste is sometimes employed in\r\nhalf-pearl mounting, which is called by the French jewelers _gouache_.\r\nThis substance contains white lead, and its use is liable to be\r\ninjurious to the workmen, cases of lead colic having been recently\r\nrecognized as thus produced. This subject has lately (1907) been brought\r\nforward at the Société Médicale des Hôpitaux in Paris. The cases were at\r\nfirst mistaken for appendicitis, but proved to be well-marked cases of\r\nlead poisoning. They had not been reported previously, and are evidently\r\nnot frequent, those noted being confined to instances in which the\r\nemployees had carelessly been in the habit of removing an excess of the\r\npaste with the tongue.\r\n\r\nPearls that are constantly worn with judicious care do not seem to\r\ndeteriorate in any way. By judicious care we mean that pearls should not\r\nbe dropped or thrown down violently or placed on any substance which is\r\nlikely to act injuriously on the surface of the pearl itself.\r\n\r\nStrings of pearls should never be dipped into water or solutions of any\r\nkind, because the string which passes through them is likely to absorb\r\nand to draw the liquid into the pearl, and as the pearl is made up of\r\nmany concentric layers, it is quite possible that, through capillary\r\naction, some liquid, either pure, or stained with a foreign substance,\r\nmight be brought into the pearl, which would in this way eventually\r\nbecome discolored. Rings and brooches containing half-pearls frequently\r\nchange color from this cause; but contact with the skin, or with lace,\r\nor with fabrics which are not stained with certain chemical solutions,\r\nseems to have no injurious effect upon pearls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Ladies’ sewing case and scissors inlaid with half-pearls\r\n\r\n  Eighteenth Century\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Watch incrusted with half-pearls\r\n\r\n  Paris Exposition, 1900\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Snuff-box, ivory inlaid with fresh-water pearls\r\n\r\n  Eighteenth Century.

Eighteenth Century\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Watch incrusted with half-pearls\r\n\r\n  Paris Exposition, 1900\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that in some instances where pearls which have been\r\ninherited are thought to have changed and lost their beauty, this belief\r\nhas been owing to an exaggerated opinion of their quality on the part of\r\nthose who expected to inherit them and who never had the opportunity to\r\nexamine them carefully. In other words, in many cases where pearls are\r\nbelieved to have lost their luster, to have died, or partly died, there\r\nseems, from the personal observation of the writer, to be little doubt\r\nthat they never were really fine pearls, and that no change had actually\r\ntaken place in them. That pearls change but slightly is evidenced by the\r\nfact that a splendid necklace belonging to the Empress Eugenie, which\r\nwas purchased about the year 1860, is in as good condition to-day as\r\nwhen it first passed into the hands of the unfortunate empress of the\r\nSecond Empire. Many of the pearls in the royal treasury in Vienna that\r\nbelonged to Maria Theresa, and those that were disposed of at the sale\r\nof the French crown jewels in 1886, as well as the pearls that are in\r\nthe imperial collection at St. Petersburg, do not seem to show any\r\nappreciable evidence of age.\r\n\r\nThe pearl is of a lower hardness than any of the precious or\r\nsemiprecious stones, and almost as soft as malachite, though not so\r\nfriable or liable to break as is that mineral; nevertheless, it is in\r\nmany ways one of the most indestructible of natural objects of the low\r\nhardness. Still, pearls, and especially fine pearls, require some care;\r\nbut, if the same attention is accorded them as would be given to a fine\r\npiece of lace, velvet, or other fabric, or to a fine jewel, they will\r\nlast for a number of generations. If, however, pearls are worn at all\r\ntimes without removal, if they are worn in the bath, if they are thrown\r\non a dressing-table, dropped on the floor, or otherwise ill-treated, if\r\nthey are worn on dusty automobile rides, in bicycle riding, or during\r\nother gymnastic or violent exercise, it is inevitable that their sides\r\nwill rub together and wear one another away. If they are worn in the\r\nbath or in swimming, the silk string which holds them, should it become\r\nsoaked, may draw some of the water, accompanied perhaps with dust and\r\nperspiration, through the drill hole into the center of the pearl, and\r\nthis is likely to be absorbed in turn by the various layers of the\r\npearl, in some instances undoubtedly affecting the color, changing it to\r\na yellow or a gray. It would be well not to wear pearls under the\r\nexceptional conditions above mentioned; and, if they are carefully wiped\r\nat times, so as to remove any perspiration or dust, their color is not\r\nlikely to be affected for a long period of time.\r\n\r\nDr. George Harley writes in the “Proceedings of the Royal Society,”\r\nMarch 1, 1888, p. 463:\r\n\r\n  On one occasion being desirous to crush into powder a split-pea\r\n  sized pearl, we folded it between two plies of note-paper, turned up\r\n  the corner of the carpet, and placing it on the hard, bare floor,\r\n  stood upon it with all our weight. Yet, notwithstanding that we\r\n  weigh over twelve stone, we failed to make any impression whatever\r\n  upon the pearl, and even stamping upon it with the heel of our boot\r\n  did not suffice so much as to fracture it. It was accordingly given\r\n  to the servant to break with a hammer, and on his return he informed\r\n  us that on attempting to break it with the hammer against the pantry\r\n  table, all he succeeded in doing was to make the pearl pierce\r\n  through the paper and sink into the wooden table, just as if it had\r\n  been the top part of an iron nail, and that it was not until he had\r\n  given it a hard blow with the hammer against the bottom of a\r\n  flat-iron that he succeeded in breaking it.\r\n\r\nAs the foregoing and other notes had appeared on this subject, the\r\nauthor was led to observe that pearls are possessed of greater\r\ndurability than is generally supposed. In order to demonstrate this\r\nsatisfactorily, he took a number of American pearls and placed them upon\r\ndifferent kinds of woods, such as white and yellow pine, white oak,\r\nteak, ash, cherry, chestnut, and rosewood. He then stood upon them, thus\r\nbringing a weight of more than two hundred pounds to bear upon them by\r\nmeans of his heel. The pearls were driven into the different woods, with\r\nthe single exception of the rosewood, which offered greater resistance\r\nso that the pearl only entered partly. In but one instance did a pearl\r\nsuffer by a slight scaling off. This shows the strength of the many\r\nconcentric layers, both mineral and vegetable.\r\n\r\nThis does not signify that pearls should be stepped upon, trodden upon,\r\nor thrown about, as it is not unlikely that a pearl would crack if it\r\nshould fall from some height upon a hardwood or stone floor.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by many that wrapping pearls in dyed velvets or in fatty\r\nwoolen materials, and locking them up in safe-deposit vaults, may\r\nslightly change them. On the other hand, there is no doubt that sunlight\r\nwill bleach a pearl, and hence it is that wearing them in the light and\r\nair cannot injuriously affect them.\r\n\r\nFor cleaning pearls, first rub them with a cloth dipped in alcohol\r\ndiluted with warm (not hot) water, or in a weak solution of soap and\r\nwater, then dip another cloth in clean water and rub the pearls until\r\nthey are dry. Be careful not to leave them wet. Either salt, rice,\r\npearl-powder, or some exceedingly soft substance may aid in cleaning\r\nthem, but no abrasive such as ground pumice, electro-silicon, or any\r\npowder that is sold as a polishing powder, should be used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EVOLUTION OF A SEED-PEARL BROOCH\r\n\r\n     Mother-of-pearl plate     Brass model Pearl brooch completed\r\n Design of brooch                               Mother-of-pearl sawn out\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     Seed-pearls, Indian strings           White horsehair for stringing\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are many things that will cause injury to pearls. Occasionally\r\nthey are affected by the wearer having exudations from the skin induced\r\nby some disease or else by acids which pass out through the pores with\r\nthe perspiration. A smoky atmosphere in which a sulphuric acid is\r\npresent owing to sulphur in the coal, violent usage such as knocking\r\nseverely, or dropping—all of these will in time cause more or less\r\ninjury to a pearl, more especially to one of the whiter varieties; but\r\nit is believed that those of a yellowish cast are not so susceptible.\r\nDiderot mentioned this as early as 1765.\r\n\r\nThe “life” of a pearl is said to be fifty, one hundred, and perhaps even\r\none hundred and fifty years; they certainly last for several\r\ngenerations. It has been asserted, without any particular authority,\r\nthat pearls from the Pacific Ocean and those from Mexico do not last as\r\nlong as those from the Orient, but this statement is questionable.\r\n\r\nIf there be any foundation for the belief that it is not well to lock\r\npearls in a safe-deposit box, this is probably owing to the fact that\r\nthe absolute exclusion from the air may cause the drying out of the\r\norganic constituent of the pearl. This may be obviated by putting the\r\npearls in a piece of linen absolutely free from any chemical, at the\r\nsame time placing with them a bit of blotting-paper or fiber-paper\r\nsaturated with water; the whole should then be wrapped up in paraffin\r\npaper, which will prevent the evaporation of the moisture.\r\n\r\nMany sentimental recitals have appeared in the press during the last ten\r\nyears in regard to the dying of pearls. In connection with this there is\r\na beautiful though mythical story to the effect that Carlotta, wife of\r\nthe ill-fated Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, was the possessor of a\r\nlarge collection of pearls which had died, and that these pearls had\r\nbeen placed in a casket and sunk in the depths of the Adriatic, opposite\r\nthe beautiful but unhappy palace home, Miramar, in the hope that the\r\nsalt water would revive and restore their original luster. When,\r\nhowever, the time came to bring up the pearls from the sea, it was found\r\nthat the casket had, in some way, broken loose from the chains, and all\r\ntrace of it was lost. It is needless to state that there was absolutely\r\nno foundation for this romantic tale; indeed, these very pearls were\r\nafterward sold. Furthermore, pearls have never lived, and hence they can\r\nnever die. They do, however, decay, if exposed to influences which\r\ndestroy either the calcareous or the animal layer of the pearl itself.\r\nThis is due to many causes: first, overheating, sometimes through the\r\ninexperience of a pearl driller; secondly, undue exposure to heat in the\r\nwashing of a pearl necklace; thirdly, exposure to acids or acid fumes.\r\nApparently there seems to be some foundation for the belief that if they\r\nare confined in safe-deposit boxes, probably in contact with wool or\r\nwith the colored velvets of jewel-cases, the skin of the pearl may be\r\nmore or less affected. There is no question that in the oriental\r\nfisheries so-called dead pearls have been found in the shell itself,\r\nprobably owing to some disease of the pearl-oyster; and they have also\r\nappeared in the fresh-water pearl fisheries of the United States, where\r\nthe pearls have been too long boiled in the opening of the shell, or\r\nwhere they have been swallowed and have passed through the body of some\r\nruminant, such as a hog, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Facsimile letter of M. Gaston Mogeaud, Director of the Louvre, Paris,\r\n    stating that the Madame Thiers’ pearls are in perfect condition, and\r\n    have never been in better health.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MADAME THIERS’S PEARL NECKLACE, BEQUEATHED TO THE LOUVRE MUSEUM, PARIS\r\n]\r\n\r\nProbably about no necklace has more been printed than about the famous\r\nnecklace of Madame Thiers, now in the Louvre Museum of Paris. Article\r\nafter article has gone over the face of the earth, stating that the\r\npearls in this necklace were dying, and that a record was being kept of\r\nthe slow death that was overtaking them. Through the courtesy of the\r\ndirector of the museum, M. Gaston Mogeaud, we are permitted to reproduce\r\nthe following statement from a letter, showing very clearly that there\r\nis absolutely no truth in the assertion, and that this necklace has in\r\nno way suffered, or is likely to suffer, for many years to come.\r\n\r\n“The necklace of Madame Thiers has caused much ink to flow, to such an\r\nextent that, a few months ago, the minister ordered an examination to be\r\nmade by three expert jewelers, who have found that the pearls are in\r\nperfect condition, and have never been in better health.”\r\n\r\nFor assuring the safety of jewels there are the primitive methods such\r\nas are used in the East Indies, of hiding pearls in out-of-the-way\r\nplaces, where they often escape detection; or else they may be protected\r\nby means of an armored room, like the gem-room that contained the\r\nwonderful collection of the Duke of Brunswick when he resided in Paris.\r\nDecoy necklaces have even been made to represent the original, and so\r\nplaced that they were taken away by the highwayman or stolen by the\r\nburglar under the belief that he was stealing the jewels; while in other\r\ncases the pearls have been carried in receptacles that would not be\r\ntaken for jewel-caskets, a device resorted to by some travelers.\r\n\r\nA word in regard to the former system of strong boxes or small safes for\r\nthe home. These protect from fire and from the ordinary thief, but they\r\nhave sometimes not proved so invulnerable to the expert cracksman. Quite\r\nrecently a jewel chest has been devised which can be placed in a trunk\r\nand carried from city to city by the owner. It is provided with an\r\nexceedingly sensitive electrical apparatus, by means of which a loud\r\nburglar alarm is set off should the chest be lifted even one\r\nthirty-second of an inch or jarred ever so slightly. This alarm is set\r\nautomatically when the owner turns the key, and if once started, it will\r\nring for a couple of hours, stopping only when the box is unlocked, thus\r\npreventing the carrying away of what is otherwise a portable box.\r\n\r\nLastly, there are the more advanced methods, in use during the past two\r\ncenturies, such as taking the jewels to a banker and allowing him to\r\nplace them in his vault, where they are guarded as well as are his own\r\nbelongings, but not always with the security of the modern safe-deposit\r\nvaults, where the gems are absolutely under the control of the owner,\r\nand can frequently be obtained at any hour of the day; or as safely kept\r\nas they are when deposited in the safe deposit of the jeweler, in whose\r\nestablishment they can be cleaned, repaired, added to, or changed\r\nwithout risking their removal to another building.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XV\r\n\r\n               PEARLS AS USED IN ORNAMENTS AND DECORATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   XV\r\n               PEARLS AS USED IN ORNAMENTS AND DECORATION\r\n\r\n\r\n                                And the necklace,\r\n              An India in itself, yet dazzling not.\r\n\r\n                                  BYRON, _Marino Faliero_.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant diamond and the love of its possession has captivated many\r\nto such a degree that it has often been the cause of intrigue and\r\nbloodshed; and national history has been influenced by its acquisition\r\nor retention. The pearl, however, though the most quiet of gems, has, in\r\nits own way, found favor in the sight of emperors and empresses, kings\r\nand queens, generals, nobles, and priests; and even savages have admired\r\nits quiet, stately dignity.\r\n\r\nThe following pages are devoted to a description of the various\r\nornamental uses of the pearl in different times and countries.\r\nNaturally, many of the famous pearls in the following chapter, if\r\nconsidered purely as ornaments, might have found a place here.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians of olden times do not appear to have used fine pearls,\r\nalthough they probably knew of them on account of the proximity of the\r\nRed Sea. M. J. de Morgan, the explorer, says: “In the tombs of Dashour I\r\nhave never seen any; the only ones that I know of in Egyptian jewelry\r\nbelong to the Ptolemaic period and are mounted in Greek style.”[422]\r\n\r\nThis statement is confirmed by Dr. William F. Petrie, the well-known\r\nEgyptologist, who writes under date of July 26, 1907: “The pearl was\r\noften used in Roman jewelry in Egypt, but I do not know of any instance\r\nof it in pure Egyptian work. The Romans pierced it and hung it by gold\r\nwire on earrings. They also made glass, pearl-like beads, called _luli_\r\nby the modern natives. These beads are made by silvering glass beads and\r\nthen flashing over them another coat of glass.”\r\n\r\nAmong specimens of the late Egyptian work we may note here some objects\r\nin the Louvre:\r\n\r\nA pleasing decoration on gold wire is a necklace in the collection of\r\nthe Egyptian Gallery. In this very small pearls are used as a connective\r\ndecoration for the points of leaves, and to hold the leaves and\r\nornaments is a gold wire which is secured by bending. This piece\r\ncomprises 104 pearls, a greater number than is contained in any other\r\nobject of antiquity found in Egypt.\r\n\r\nAn Egyptian pendant of unknown origin is also shown in this collection.\r\nAt the lower end is a bull’s head, caparisoned, and the tip of each horn\r\nis fitted with a ball like the _embolados toros_ of the Spanish\r\nbull-fights. The rein is double, and above this there are two rondelles\r\nof an unidentified material; then comes a rondelle of lapis lazuli, and\r\nafter this a rondelle of gold. The whole is strung with twisted gold\r\nwire. The center stone is an hexagonal amethyst, evidently a crystal,\r\nthe two faces of which had been polished and incised. One of these faces\r\nrepresents a priest with a staff of office, and the other a priest\r\nholding an incense-burner with the hieroglyph of the altar. With one\r\nhand he is offering the two sacrifices, the mineral and the vegetable;\r\nin the other he holds a garland of flowers or leaves. Above this is an\r\nOriental pearl somewhat worn and abraded. All these are secured by a\r\ntwisted gold wire, to which four tiny gold beads of graduated size are\r\naffixed at the top of the pendant.\r\n\r\nThere are six other pendants and earrings in the Egyptian Gallery, all\r\nof which contain pearls, and in most instances these pearls have been\r\ndrilled and suspended by metal wires, unless they are used as an\r\nornament facing outward. In four instances they are secured by a peg of\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nThe Assyrian and Persian bas-reliefs show that the sovereigns and great\r\npersonages of those countries adorned themselves profusely with pearls.\r\nThey wore them not only in their jewelry, but also on their garments and\r\neven in their beards![423] The coins of the Persian kings also bear\r\ntestimony to the use of the gem in ancient Persia, since the sovereigns\r\nare represented wearing tiaras ornamented with triple rows of\r\npearls.[424] The same may be said of the imperial Roman diadem from the\r\ntime of Caracalla (188–217 A.D.).\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of all ancient pearl necklaces,[425]\r\ncontaining more pearls than any other that has been found, and in a\r\nbetter state of preservation, is the Susa necklace now in the Persian\r\nGallery of the Louvre Museum. It consists of three rows, each containing\r\n72 pearls, so that there are 216 in all. Ten gold bars, formed of three\r\nsmall disks, each about five millimeters in diameter, divide the\r\nnecklace into nine equal sections; at each end there is a disk, ten\r\nmillimeters in diameter, to which the three strands are secured. If\r\nthere was any other setting, it has evidently disappeared, although it\r\nis quite possible that there may only have been a string at each end, as\r\nin the East Indian necklaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANTIQUE ORNAMENTS OF PEARLS\r\n\r\n  No. 1.

M. de Morgan gives\r\n_circa_ 350 B.C. as the probable date of these objects. The pearls were\r\nmuch deteriorated. About 238 were found, but many of them crumbled away\r\nwhen they were touched. M. de Morgan considers that the necklace was of\r\nthe type of the “dog-collar” of to-day, and he believes that it\r\noriginally comprised from 400 to 500 pearls.\r\n\r\nAccording to a personal communication from M. P. Cavvadias, of the\r\nSociété Archéologique d’Athènes, there are no pearls on the ancient\r\nornaments preserved in the National Museum at Athens. This is hardly\r\nsurprising in view of the fact that the greater part of these ornaments\r\nbelong to the archaic period of Greek art; that is to say, to a time\r\nwhen the pearl was evidently unknown to the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe fact that we do not find more evidence of the use of pearls in\r\nGreece at a later period need cause no surprise, when we consider how\r\nmany of the treasures of Greek art have disappeared in the course of\r\nmore than twenty centuries. There can be no question that they were\r\nknown and used as ornaments at an early time, as we can infer from the\r\ndescription of them by Theophrastus and later Greek authors.\r\n\r\nDr. Edward Robinson of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and other\r\nauthorities on Greek art and archæology, maintain that the Arethusa\r\nnecklace, and other ornaments of that time, depicted on coins, etc.,\r\nwere meant to represent gold ornaments, as it is believed by many that\r\npearls were unknown in Greece at that period.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting specimens showing the use of a pearl in\r\nancient times is a very beautiful pearl pin from Paphos, on the Island\r\nof Cyprus, which is mounted with a large marine pearl, probably the\r\nlargest antique pearl ever found, measuring fourteen millimeters in\r\ndiameter, and weighing about 70 grains. This, unfortunately, has been\r\nvery much abraded and worn away, although more than half of the pearl is\r\nstill present. It is surmounted by a small fresh-water pearl, four\r\nmillimeters in diameter, weighing about two grains and in a much better\r\nstate of preservation. This unusually interesting example of prehistoric\r\npearl is in the Greek and Roman department of the British Museum, and we\r\nare able to show it by the courtesy of the keeper of that department,\r\nDr. Charles Hercules Read.\r\n\r\nIn excavations made last spring (1907), in the Hauran district in Syria,\r\nAzeez Khayat found a number of loose pearls which had formed a necklace.\r\nThe tomb in which they were discovered was cut in the rock, and appeared\r\nto be of Roman origin. The pearls were still attached to the old bronze\r\nwire with which they had been strung. Mr. Khayat also mentions the\r\nfinding of a pearl pin, and a single earring bearing a pearl, in a\r\nrock-tomb at Cæsarea, in Syria. Rock-cut tombs from ten to twelve feet\r\nin depth are frequently discovered, and they probably date from the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nThe habit was so common of using pearls as a base to throw up the\r\nbrilliance of other gems, that we may, perhaps, believe even in\r\nCaligula’s slippers of pearls, with rubies and emeralds set upon them\r\nlike flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Roman ladies had a special favor for pearls as earrings, and it was\r\none of their consuming ambitions to possess exceptionally fine specimens\r\nfor this purpose. They preferred pear-shaped pearls, and often wore two\r\nor three of them strung together. They jingled gently as they moved\r\nabout—a fitting accompaniment, it may be said, to their graceful\r\nmovements—and from this jingling the name _crotalia_, or “rattles,” was\r\napplied to them.\r\n\r\nThe description given by Pliny of the pearl ornaments of Lollia Paulina\r\nis the principal claim which the wife of Caligula has on our interest.\r\n\r\n  I myselfe have seen Lollia Paulina when she was dressed ... so beset\r\n  and bedeckt all over with hemeraulds and pearles, disposed in rewes,\r\n  ranks, and courses one by another; round about the attire of her\r\n  head, her cawle, her borders, her perruke of hair, her bongrace and\r\n  chaplet; at her ears pendant, about her neck in a carcanet, upon her\r\n  wrest in bracelets, & on her fingers in rings; that she glittered\r\n  and shone againe like the sun as she went. The value of these\r\n  ornaments she esteemed and rated at forty million Sestertij[426] and\r\n  offered openly to prove it out of hand by her bookes of accounts and\r\n  reckonings. Yet were not these jewels the gifts and presents of the\r\n  prodigall prince her husband, but the goods and ornaments from her\r\n  owne house, fallen to her by way of inheritance from her\r\n  grandfather, which he had gotten together even by the robbing and\r\n  spoiling of whole provinces. See what the issue and end was of those\r\n  extortions and outrageous exactions of his: this was it. That M.\r\n  Lollius, slandered and defamed for receiving bribes and presents of\r\n  the kings in the East; and being out of favor with C. Cæsar, sonne\r\n  of Augustus, and having lost his amitie, dranke a cup of poison, and\r\n  prevented his judiciall triall: that forsooth his neece Lollia, all\r\n  to be hanged with jewels of 400 hundred thousand Sestertij, should\r\n  be seene glittering, and looked at of every man by candle-light all\r\n  a supper time.[427]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TYSZKIEWICZ BRONZE STATUETTE OF APHRODITE, SHOWING EARRINGS OF PEARL\r\n    AND GOLD OF EARLY GREEK PERIOD\r\n\r\n  Now in Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Mass.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnd the taste of the Roman ladies for pearls has perpetuated itself in\r\nItaly, though other of the luxurious habits which in their case\r\naccompanied it, have long since died out. The women of Florence even now\r\nare not content if they do not possess a necklet of pearls, and this\r\ngenerally forms the marriage portion of the middle-class women. It is\r\nthought, just as it was in ancient Rome, that this gives an air of\r\nrespectability, and forms a sure protection from insult in the street or\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest illustrations showing a pearl earring is the one in\r\nthe ear of Julia, the daughter of Titus, incised on a splendid\r\naquamarine in the Bibliothèque Nationale. This gem was formerly in the\r\nTreasury of St. Denis, and is considered to belong to the Carlovingian\r\nperiod.[428]\r\n\r\nSo large and heavy were the earrings worn in Rome that there were women\r\nknown as _auriculæ ornatrices_, special doctresses whose sole occupation\r\nwas the healing of ear tumors and of injured or infected ears. In a\r\nsimilar way, at the present day, we have the ear piercer, whose\r\nvocation, however, is rapidly becoming useless because of the ingenious\r\nmodern devices for holding the pearls to unpierced ears; and we must\r\nconsider this eminently desirable when we think of the ear-piercing\r\noutfits of the former jeweler, who never disinfected his apparatus, and\r\nwhen we recall the fact that it was always expected that the ear would\r\nswell, first, from the crude awl that was used, and, secondly, from the\r\nunsterilized instruments.\r\n\r\nThat the Romans believed in decorating the statues of their goddesses\r\nwith pearls and dedicating them as offerings, is evidenced by the gift\r\nof Cleopatra’s pearl, which was cut in halves to make earrings for the\r\nVenus of the Pantheon; and by the buckler of British pearls for the\r\nstatue of Venus Genetrix, given by Julius Cæsar. Quite a number of\r\nstatues and busts of the Roman period, and some of an earlier time, have\r\nthe ears pierced for the reception of earrings, and it is highly\r\nprobable that pearls were used for this decoration. Among these are the\r\nbusts of Pallas and Juno Lanuvina in the Vatican; that of Eirene, a\r\nmarble copy of a work of Cephisdotus, in the Glyptothek, Munich, and the\r\nVenus de Medici in the Uffizi, Florence.\r\n\r\nPottier[429] mentions several other Greek statues which show that\r\nearrings were used for their adornment; as, for example, the winged\r\nVictory of Archernos, in Delos; the head of one of the caryatids found\r\nat Delphi, a cast of which is in the Louvre; the archaic Aphrodite of\r\nthe Villa Ludovisi; the Athena from the frieze of the temple at Ægina;\r\nthe Venus of Milo, etc. In other instances the ornament was simply\r\npainted on the ear as is shown in the Aphrodite in white marble which\r\nhas been found in Marseilles. This may also have been the case in the\r\nfrieze at Olympia. The earrings used in these statues were usually metal\r\ndisks entirely covering the lobe of the ear. We have, however, many\r\nrepresentations of pearl earrings in the paintings at Pompeii, and on\r\ncameos and coins. These show us several of the types mentioned by Pliny\r\nand other authors; still, they are smaller and more unpretentious than\r\nwe might expect in view of the well-known luxury of the Roman ladies in\r\nthis respect. The greater part of the earrings represented show a pearl\r\nsuspended from a single wire; there are some, however, with three\r\npearls, one above the other,[430] and a few bearing several pearls\r\nloosely hung together, answering to the description of the _crotalia_.\r\nOthers, again, bear pear-shaped pearls or _elenchi_.[431] It is a\r\nsingular fact that scarcely any of the busts of Roman women are\r\nornamented with earrings, but it is quite possible that the cause for\r\nthis must be sought in the desire of the artist to dispense with\r\nunimportant details which might detract from the general effect he\r\nwished to produce. We may note, however, four female figures in the\r\nGallerie des Empereurs in the Louvre Museum, with the ears pierced for\r\nthe reception of earrings (Nos. 1195, 1202, 1230, and 1269).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pearl earrings from Herculaneum and Pompeii\r\n]\r\n\r\nMany numismatists, among them Dr. F. Louis Comparette,[432] believe that\r\nthe necklaces and earrings represented on Greek coins from the fifth\r\ncentury B.C. are intended to represent pearl ornaments, since the\r\npersonages depicted are in all cases female divinities, goddesses, or\r\nnymphs, held in great veneration in the city where the coins were\r\nminted, and it is almost certain that the artist intended to portray the\r\nchoicest and most beautiful of gems as an adornment for the beautiful\r\nhead of the city’s patron.\r\n\r\nThe Syracusan coins, by Euvenetus, minted in the early part of the fifth\r\ncentury B.C., and bearing the head of Arethusa, seem to be the earliest\r\ncoins showing a neck and ear ornament. This was later imitated on the\r\nGreek and Greco-Roman coins. A coin of Sulla shows a double necklace,\r\none strand consisting of round beads and the other of pendants. The\r\nlater coins almost always represent the goddesses with neck and ear\r\nornaments. Some of the latter, however, resembling amphoræ, are neither\r\nround nor pear-shaped.\r\n\r\nIn view of the great fondness of the Romans for pearls, it is not\r\nsurprising that many of these gems have been found in the excavations at\r\nPompeii, Herculaneum, and Capodimonte. The collection of earrings\r\npreserved in the Naples Museum is especially noteworthy. Here we can see\r\nearrings consisting of a simple golden hoop, from which hangs a wire\r\nbearing a single pearl; others in which a cross-bar is attached to the\r\nhoop, and at each end of this bar is a loosely hung wire with a pearl at\r\nits extremity, this earring suggesting the _crotalia_ mentioned by Pliny\r\n(see Fig. A); and still others wherein the pearls are strung directly on\r\nthe hoop. The cross-bars are of various designs, sometimes entirely\r\nsmooth, and again shaped like a cornice or a pediment; in other cases we\r\nhave an earring with two pearls on a wire, then a pierced transparent\r\nstone, and beneath that, two pearls terminating the large drop. A few of\r\nthe earrings are more elaborate, as, for example, one represented in\r\nFig. B which was found in Pompeii, March 8, 1870. Here there is an\r\nemerald in the center, surrounded by gold rays, between which were set\r\neight pearls, two of which are now missing; above is a small pearl. The\r\nsingle earring shown in Fig. D came from Herculaneum, and bears a\r\ncirclet of thirteen pearls, alternating with rubies and other stones;\r\nbeneath there is a link from which depends a pearl about seven and a\r\nfifth millimeters in diameter, and weighing nearly twelve grains. The\r\nfact that we know the latest date to which these pearls can be assigned,\r\nnamely, 79 A.D., renders them peculiarly interesting and valuable from a\r\nhistorical point of view. Naturally, many of them are calcined or\r\notherwise damaged, but others are fairly well preserved as to form,\r\nalthough the luster has departed from them. There are twenty-seven\r\nearrings in the collection, and the pearls number about one hundred. No\r\ngreat pearls were found.\r\n\r\nIn the Roman excavations, and in those of other early remains, many\r\nobjects are found in which there may be a sapphire, an emerald, or\r\nseveral other stones, pierced, and pendant on a gold wire, with a blank\r\nspace between, showing that something was there originally. This object\r\nhas apparently decomposed and fallen away. We may reasonably suppose\r\nthat it was either a pearl or a glass bead, and it is unlikely that\r\nglass would be used in connection with the more precious materials. This\r\npearl or glass may have been affected by the organic acids or the acids\r\nresulting from the decomposition of the body with which the ornament was\r\nburied for a score of centuries.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient jewels containing pearls which are preserved in the\r\nHermitage at St. Petersburg, we may mention a broken gold ring with a\r\nroughly cut turquoise and two pendants, each set with two pearls\r\nseparated by a garnet. This object was found in southern Siberia during\r\nthe reign of Peter the Great, and may belong to the second century\r\nbefore Christ. Also may be noted a pair of gold earrings, with an\r\nengraved six-rayed star, in the center of which a pearl is set, while\r\nbelow hang three pendant sticks, two of which have a pearl at the\r\nextremity. These earrings were found in 1892 in a tomb situated close to\r\nthe site of the ancient town of Chersonesus, in the Crimea. As a coin of\r\nthe Emperor Gordianus III (224–244 A.D.) was discovered in the same\r\ntomb, we may assign the earrings to the first half of the third century\r\nA.D.\r\n\r\nBeside another pair of earrings, one of which is set with a pearl, and\r\ntwo pearl-headed pins, all from the neighborhood of Tiflis, in the\r\nCrimea, we may especially refer to an earring made of a plain, thick,\r\ngolden wire, on which seven pearls are threaded; one of these occupies\r\nthe center and the others are grouped around it. This earring was\r\npurchased in 1903 by the Russian Imperial Archæological Commission from\r\na collector residing at Odessa; it is said to have been found on the\r\nsite of the ancient Greek colony of Olbia, but we have no definite\r\nexternal or internal evidence to sustain this view.\r\n\r\nWe may also note the gold necklace and earrings[433] containing pearls\r\nfound near the site of Olbia during the reign of Napoleon III, and now\r\nin the collection of the Roman, Campana. These objects are especially\r\ninteresting owing to the fact that the pearls are drilled and a gold cap\r\nis set on each side.\r\n\r\nA pair of pearl earrings were found in a tomb on Mount Mithridates, near\r\nKertch, in the Crimea. These earrings probably belong to the third or\r\nfourth century of our era. Of the four pearls which originally adorned\r\nthe cross-bars, only one has been preserved. Another pair of earrings\r\nwas discovered in the same place. It is probable that they were\r\nornamented with pearls in a similar way, but the latter have entirely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANTIQUE PEARL ORNAMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  No. 1.

This use is especially typified in a\r\nbaldachin of gold embroidered with pearls which is over the sepulcher of\r\nMohammed at Mecca.[434]\r\n\r\nWhen the Mohammedans captured the Persian city Ctesiphon, in 637, they\r\ncollected an immense booty. Each of the 60,000 soldiers received the\r\nvalue of 12,000 dirhems ($1560), a total of $93,600,000. Among the\r\ntreasures sent to Caliph Omar (581–644), in Medina, was a crown, perhaps\r\nthat of Khusrau I (499–579), which Tabari says was studded with 1000\r\npearls each as large as a bird’s egg.[435] There was also a wonderful\r\ncarpet 450 feet long and 90 broad, with a border of emeralds, rubies,\r\nsapphires, and pearls, representing luxuriant foliage and beautiful\r\nflowers. Tabari states that it was called the “Winter Carpet,” because\r\n“the Persian kings used it in winter when there was no longer verdure or\r\nflowers, for whoever was seated on this carpet thought he looked out\r\nupon a garden or a green field.”[436]\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the marriage of the Caliph Al-Mamun (786–833) with\r\nthe daughter of Hassan Sahal, all the grandees of Al-Mamun received\r\nslaves of both sexes as presents from the bride’s father. The\r\npreliminary negotiations were held at Fomal Saleh, and the road\r\ntraversed by the bride and bridegroom to reach Bagdad, a distance of one\r\nhundred miles, was covered with mats of cloth of gold and silver. We are\r\ntold that the bride wore on her head-dress a thousand pearls, each of\r\nwhich is said to have been of enormous value.[437]\r\n\r\nDescribing the birthday festival of Kublai Khan (_circa_ 1275 A.D.),\r\nMarco Polo says: “The Great Kaan dresses in the best of his robes, all\r\nwrought with beaten gold; and full 12,000 Barons and Knights on that day\r\ncame forth dressed in robes of the same colour, and precisely like those\r\nof the Great Kaan, except that they are not so costly; but still they\r\nare all of the same colour as his, and are also of silk and gold. Every\r\nman so clothed has a girdle of gold; and this as well as the dress is\r\ngiven him by the Sovereign. And I will aver that there are some of these\r\nsuits decked with so many pearls and precious stones that a single suit\r\nshall be worth full 10,000 golden bezants [about $25,000].”[438]\r\n\r\nIn the Kan period, in China, the dead bodies of the emperors were\r\nembalmed and wrapped in a garment ornamented with pearls. They were then\r\ninclosed in a case of jade.[439]\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the jewels of the King of Maabar, or what is now known as\r\nthe Coromandel Coast, Marco Polo tells us: “It is a fact that the king\r\ngoes as bare as the rest, only round his loins he has a piece of fine\r\ncloth and round his neck he has a necklace entirely of precious\r\nstones,—rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and the like, insomuch that this\r\ncollar is of great value. He wears also hanging in front of his chest\r\nfrom the neck downwards, a fine silk thread strung with 104 large pearls\r\nand rubies of great price. The reason why he wears this cord with the\r\n104 great pearls is (according to what they tell) that every day,\r\nmorning and evening, he has to say 104 prayers to his idols. Such is\r\ntheir religion and custom; and thus did all the kings his ancestors\r\nbefore him, and they bequeathed the string of pearls to him that he\r\nshould do the like.”[440]\r\n\r\nA favorite East Indian amulet is known as the “Nao-ratna” or\r\n“Nao-ratan,” and consists of “nine gems”: in former times the pearl,\r\nruby, topaz, diamond, emerald, lapis lazuli, coral, sapphire, and a\r\nstone, not identified, called the gomeda. At the present time these\r\nstones are generally the coral, topaz, sapphire, ruby, flat diamond, cut\r\ndiamond, emerald, hyacinth, and carbuncle. This talisman may suggest the\r\nUrim and Thummin or sacred oracle of the Jews, which was said to have\r\nbeen taken from Jerusalem in 615 A.D. by Khusrau II, the Sassanian\r\nPersian king.\r\n\r\nThe East Indian custom for persons of quality was to wear a pearl\r\nbetween two colored stones in each ear, that is, either between two\r\nrubies or two emeralds; and Tavernier noted, about 1670, that there was\r\nno person of any consideration in those regions who did not wear, in\r\neach ear, a pearl set between two colored stones. Another favorite\r\nornament for women in India is a girdle elegantly embroidered, bearing a\r\nlarge pendant pearl in front, where it is fastened.[441]\r\n\r\nA necklace of twenty-seven pearls bears in India the name of _nakshatra\r\nmālā, nakshatras_ (originally “stars”) being the name of the\r\ntwenty-seven divisions of the Hindu zodiac.[442]\r\n\r\nIn the Indian jewels often a small spot of enamel is fastened or melted\r\non to a gold wire, and then one or several pearls are hung upon it; or\r\nbeads of some gems, as sapphire, ruby, emerald, or even glass, may be\r\nadded or alternated with pearls. Then the enamel stop-piece is turned\r\ndown and the other end of the gold wire is twisted on to the setting,\r\nloosely, in such a manner as to swing freely. It is the effect of these\r\ndozens or even hundreds of swinging drops that add such grace and\r\nelegance to East Indian jewelry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EAST INDIAN NECKLACE OF PEARLS, TABLE DIAMONDS, GLASS BEADS, GOLD AND\r\n    ENAMEL\r\n\r\n  Property of an American lady\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn China, such precious stones as the ruby, sapphire—both blue and\r\nyellow—the emerald, and the pink tourmaline, are not facetted, as with\r\nus, but are generally polished in conformity to the shape of the bead or\r\nother ornament, and never have a lathe-turned or cut appearance; they\r\nare either set in cabochon or as beads, rounded, oval, or elongated. All\r\nthese forms, and the colors used by the Chinese, lend themselves well to\r\ncombinations with pearls; and hence pearls are often found in Chinese\r\njewelry, especially in those ornaments which are flexible and graceful,\r\nin which the pearls and gems are strung on wire and allowed to swing\r\nfreely with a gentle tinkle when the wearer moves. This is not unlike\r\nthe setting of such gems in ancient Roman times. An admirable example is\r\nshown and described in Bushell’s “Chinese Art” (Vol. II, plate 108, page\r\n90). In this head-dress of a Manchu lady, there are combined with the\r\npearls, jadeite, amethyst, amber, and coral, on a gilt silver openwork,\r\nwith blue kingfisher feathers. This great cap of state is an admirable\r\nexample of pure Chinese design and workmanship. The pendant strings of\r\npearls are occasionally relieved by a bit of carved jade, carnelian or\r\ncoral, especially the latter. Another example, the “cap of state” has\r\nsilver-gilt openwork and immortelles (Taoist symbols), and is much\r\nenhanced in beauty by a decoration or inlay of plates of the beautiful\r\nblue feathers of the kingfisher, which are used so extensively and\r\neffectively in Chinese jewelry. The pearls are scattered at intervals\r\nover the cap, and ten strings of them hang from the sides of it. This is\r\nbelieved to be of Manchu origin by Dr. Stephen W. Bushell, the great\r\nChinese scholar, to whom we are indebted for the use of the\r\nillustration. We are also told that young ladies in China wear a sort of\r\ncrown constructed of pasteboard, covered with silk. This is adorned with\r\npearls, diamonds, and other jewels.[443]\r\n\r\nThe pearls on many Chinese ornaments were generally strung upon silk,\r\noften with half a dozen or a dozen seed-pearls above and below the large\r\npearl, to hold the latter in place, and also to add a softness to the\r\nwhole jewel. The end pendant pearl, even if pear-shaped, was usually\r\npierced entirely through, and a wire that was worked through it was\r\nflattened out, and this gold head was again ornamented in some way. A\r\nChinese pendant from the China-Japan war-loot offers an excellent\r\nillustration of this kind of pearl-setting. This was preserved in a\r\ndouble box of finely carved gold.\r\n\r\nThe rosaries containing 104 pearls, which are used to-day, were\r\nmentioned centuries ago by Marco Polo, and an excellent pearl string of\r\nthis kind has been in the Russian Treasury at Moscow for over two\r\nhundred years. Dr. Stewart Culin, the archæologist, who has paid much\r\nattention to Chinese customs, informs us that the black and white\r\ncounters made for use in games by the Chinese are called black and white\r\npearls.\r\n\r\nDr. T. Nishikawa writes us in 1908 that pearls were used in Japan for\r\nornamental purposes more than a thousand years ago. Large abalone pearls\r\nare found in images of Buddha made in 300 A.D. Fresh-water pearls,\r\nusually from Dipsas and Unio, were also used. A beautiful color-print\r\nwas made by Hoku’ai of the first pearl, called “tide-jewel” by the\r\nJapanese.\r\n\r\nMost interesting pearls are those in a brooch in the British Museum,\r\nwhich was discovered in 1839 while excavating a sewer opposite Ludgate\r\nHill in Thames Street, at the depth of about nine feet, in a\r\ndark-colored artificial stratum of earth, unaccompanied by any remains\r\nthat could aid in throwing light upon its history. It is four inches and\r\na half in circumference, and is composed of a circular compartment an\r\ninch and a quarter in diameter, set with variegated enamel, representing\r\na full-faced head and bust, with a crown on the head, and the drapery of\r\na mantle, formed of threads of gold effectively arranged so as to mark\r\nthe features of the face and the folds of the drapery; this is inclosed\r\nin a border of rich gold filigree work, set at equal distances with four\r\npearls.[444] Dr. Charles Roach Smith attributes this brooch to the time\r\nof King Alfred, and supposes it to have been executed in England by a\r\nforeign artist. He only ventures a conjecture that the head might be\r\nthat of King Alfred.\r\n\r\nCrowns, both ancient and modern, are richly ornamented with pearls. We\r\nshall treat of the crown of the Holy Roman Empire and of the imperial\r\nAustrian crown in the following chapter. One of the most interesting and\r\nancient is the famous crown of Khusrau II (reigned 590–638), made in the\r\nlatter part of the sixth century, which was brought to light by Shah\r\nAbbas after a thousand years of concealment in an obscure fortress among\r\nthe mountains of Lauristan. It does not contain diamonds among its\r\nornaments, but is incrusted with pearls and rubies.[445]\r\n\r\nFrom the representation given on the cup of Khusrau, the throne of the\r\nSassanian Persian kings appears to have been as large as a couch; it was\r\nsupported by four winged animals, whose model had been borrowed by the\r\nSassanians from their ancestors, and it was covered with an embroidered\r\nstuff thrown over mattresses and cushions. If we may believe Tabari\r\n(“Chronicles,” trans. by Zotenberg, Vol. II, p. 304), this throne was of\r\ngold, enriched with precious stones, and surmounted by a crown of gold\r\nand pearls, so heavy that the sovereign could not wear it, and therefore\r\nhad it suspended above his head.[446]\r\n\r\nOne of the crowns in the Hermitage at St. Petersburg was discovered in\r\n1864 in a tumulus near Novo-Tcherkask, with many other valuable objects,\r\nall of which had apparently been buried with some important personage.\r\nThis crown resembles somewhat that of Reccesvinthus in the treasure of\r\nGuerrazar, although some portions of it seem to belong to the period of\r\nthe Roman empire. The conjecture has been made that the crown may have\r\nbeen worn by a queen since it is decorated with a finely executed bust\r\nof a woman in amethyst. The crown itself is of pure gold, and was\r\nbordered with two rows of pearls, which have disappeared, leaving only\r\nthe small disks to which they were attached; besides these, it was\r\nornamented with a number of uncut precious stones. The date of this\r\nobject cannot be exactly determined, although the consensus of opinion\r\nis that it belongs to about the third century after Christ. Possibly the\r\nbust and some other portions, which appear to be of Greco-Roman\r\nworkmanship, are of this period, while the rest of the crown was\r\nexecuted one or two centuries later; it is about seven inches in\r\ndiameter and two in height.[447]\r\n\r\nToward the end of the year 1858 a French officer who lived in Spain,\r\nwhile making some excavations on a property he owned there, discovered\r\nfourteen small gold crowns. They were taken to the Spanish mint and are\r\nsaid to have been melted for bullion. New excavations on the same spot\r\nbrought to light eight other crowns of considerable weight, of the\r\nfinest workmanship, and incrusted with precious stones, pearls, etc.\r\nThere is no doubt that these crowns were buried in the early years of\r\nthe eighth century, when the Arabs, led by Tarik, invaded Spain and\r\nforced the Gothic dynasty to take refuge in the north of Europe. The\r\nimportance of this discovery is very great, since it gives us positive\r\nevidence of the development of the goldsmith’s art in Spain at that\r\nearly period. An inscription proves that one of the crowns was dedicated\r\nin the second half of the seventh century, and it is one of the few\r\nauthentic memorials we possess of that epoch. In February, 1859, the\r\neight crowns were purchased by the French government and placed in the\r\nMusée de Cluny. Two other crowns found in the same place were added in\r\n1860, and complete the collection.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these crowns is that of the Gothic king, Reccesvinthus,\r\nwho was King of Spain from 649 to 672. It is composed of a wide band of\r\nsolid gold, ten centimeters wide and twenty-one centimeters in diameter\r\n(about four and eight inches respectively). This band, which opens by\r\nmeans of a hinge, is surrounded by two borders of gold set with the red\r\nstones of Caria, called “gemmae alabandenses,” and the band itself is\r\nstudded with thirty large oriental sapphires of the greatest beauty.\r\nThirty fine pearls of appropriate size alternate with the sapphires on a\r\nground incrusted with the red stones above mentioned. From twenty-three\r\nsmall gold chains depend large letters in cloisonné, and also incrusted,\r\nforming the sentence: RECCESVINTHUS REX OFFERET. Each letter has a gold\r\npendant with a pearl from which hangs a pear-shaped sapphire.\r\n\r\nThe crown is suspended from four chains, converging to a double floral\r\nornament of solid gold, adorned with twelve sapphire pendants. This\r\nornament, the leaves of which are open, is surmounted by a capital of\r\nrock crystal, then comes a ball of the same material, and the whole is\r\nterminated by the gold center to which the four chains are attached.\r\n\r\nThe cross, which is suspended underneath the crown by a gold chain, is\r\nremarkable for its elegance and its richness. It is of solid gold and is\r\ninlaid with six very fine sapphires and eight large pearls, each of\r\nwhich is mounted in relief with claws. At the back, the cross still\r\nbears the wire by which it was attached to the royal mantle. The inside\r\nof the crown is quite smooth; the outside is composed of elegant\r\nfleurettes in openwork, the leaves being filled with the same species of\r\nred carnelian mentioned above. There are thirty sapphires, all of the\r\nfinest water, and a few of them show the natural facetted\r\ncrystallization; the two principal ones, placed in the center of the\r\nband, are thirty millimeters in diameter. The pearls are of an\r\nexceptional size, and only a few of them have been injured by time. The\r\ntotal number on the crown, cross, and top ornament, is seventy, thirty\r\nof which are unusually large. The chains are each composed of five\r\nopenwork ornaments with an enamel paste inlaid in the gold edge. A close\r\nexamination of the crown shows that it had been worn before the king\r\npresented it to some church.\r\n\r\nThe royal Hungarian crown given to St. Stephen by the pope in the year\r\n1000 A.D., when Hungary became an empire, is one of the most ancient\r\ncrowns in existence. It contains 320 pearls and was procured in\r\nByzantium. It was pledged to the emperor, Frederick IV, by Queen\r\nElizabeth of Hungary, probably about 1440.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CROWN OF RECCESVINTHUS AND OTHER GOTHIC CROWNS OF THE SEVENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n  From the treasure of Guarrazar, near Toledo\r\n\r\n  Musée de Cluny, Paris\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the cathedral of Prague (the metropolitan church of St. Vitus) there\r\nmay be seen the crown which was made by the order of Charles IV (1378)\r\nout of four pounds, ten and a quarter ounces of gold. It is adorned with\r\ntwenty-nine pearls, forty-seven rubies, twenty sapphires, and\r\ntwenty-five emeralds. The value of the gold and gems was estimated at\r\n$10,000 in 1898, which is probably less than it would be worth to-day.\r\nThe sacred crown worn by St. Wenceslaus was inserted within the crown of\r\nCharles IV at the instance of Queen Blanca. The golden scepter and the\r\ngolden orb are of very beautiful workmanship. The scepter has six\r\nrubies, eight sapphires, and thirty-one pearls. There may also be seen\r\nin the treasury a gilded monstrance, in the style of the Renaissance,\r\nstudded with pearls and precious stones, a gift of the princely family\r\nof Schwarzenberg. Within the same cathedral, in the tabernacle of the\r\nchapel of St. Ludmilla, wife of the first Duke of Bohemia, is the head\r\nof that saint, bearing a crown studded with 1800 pearls.[448]\r\n\r\nThe crown of Vladimir, with its singular and thoroughly Russian form, is\r\npreserved in the treasury of the Kremlin at Moscow, and has been used at\r\nthe coronation of all the Russian emperors. It has borne the name of the\r\ncrown or cap of Monomachus from the reign of Ivan IV. Although, to judge\r\nfrom this designation, the crown was probably executed in the twelfth or\r\nthirteenth century, there is a legend to the effect that it was sent, in\r\n988, from Byzantium by the ruler as a gift to St. Vladimir. It is\r\nexecuted in filigree work, and is surmounted by a plain cross with four\r\npearls at the extremities; between these pearls are set a topaz, a\r\nsapphire, and a ruby. The crown itself is ornamented with four emeralds,\r\nfour rubies, and twenty-five pearls from Ormus, set in gold. The cap has\r\na bordering of sable fur, and is lined with red satin. (See Maskell,\r\n“Russian Art,” London, 1884, p. 125.)\r\n\r\nThe imperial state crown of her Majesty Queen Victoria, was made in the\r\nyear 1838 by Messrs. Rondell and Bridge, with jewels taken from old\r\ncrowns, and others furnished by command of her Majesty. It consisted of\r\ndiamonds, pearls, rubies, sapphires, and emeralds, set in silver and\r\ngold. It had a crimson velvet cap with ermine border, and was lined with\r\nwhite silk. Its gross weight was thirty-nine ounces five pennyweights\r\ntroy. The lower part of the band above the ermine border consisted of a\r\nrow of 129 pearls, and the upper part of a row of 112 pearls; between\r\nthese rows, in the front of the crown, was a large sapphire (partly\r\ndrilled) purchased for the crown by his Majesty George IV. In the front\r\nof the crown, and in the center of a diamond Maltese cross, was the\r\nfamous ruby said to have been given to Edward, Prince of Wales (the\r\nBlack Prince), by Don Pedro, King of Castile, after the battle of\r\nNájera, near Vittoria, 1367 A.D. This ruby was worn in the helmet of\r\nHenry V at the battle of Agincourt, 1415 A.D. It was pierced quite\r\nthrough, after the eastern custom, the upper part of the piercing being\r\nfilled up by a small ruby. From the Maltese cross issued four imperial\r\narches composed of oak leaves and acorns, thirty-two pearls forming the\r\nacorns. From the upper part of the arches were suspended four large\r\npendant, pear-shaped pearls with rose diamond cups.[449] Writing in\r\n1850, Barbot, the French jeweler, placed the value of this crown at\r\n$600,000.\r\n\r\nThe crown of St. Edward, the official crown of England, is used at each\r\ncoronation.[450] The original crown of this name was destroyed by the\r\nrepublicans in 1649, but at the time of the coronation of Charles II,\r\nanother crown was made to take its place, under the direction of Sir\r\nRobert Viner. As far as can be known, this crown was an exact copy of\r\nthe older one, which was worn by Edward the Confessor, and perhaps even\r\nby King Alfred. The crown in use at present is of gold, richly studded\r\nwith pearls and precious stones of various kinds: diamonds, rubies,\r\nemeralds, and sapphires. There is a mound of gold on top, and on this a\r\ncross of gold ornamented with very large oval pearls, one attached to\r\nthe top and the two others pendant from the ends of the cross. The\r\npresent arrangement of the jewels cannot date back earlier than 1689, as\r\nthe crown was found to be despoiled of them at the time of the accession\r\nof William and Mary. Those now in the crown are acknowledged to be\r\ninferior to the former ones.\r\n\r\nThe orb or mound which is placed in the king’s hand immediately after\r\nhis coronation, is a ball of gold, six inches in diameter, surrounded by\r\na band of the same metal ornamented with roses of diamonds set around\r\nother precious stones, and bordered with pearls. It is surmounted by a\r\ncross, embellished with four larger pearls at the angles near its\r\ncenter, and three others at the ends. The orb, including the cross, is\r\neleven inches high, and it is figured on the coins of many of the\r\nEnglish kings, who are represented holding it in their left hands.\r\n\r\nThe regalia of Scotland,[451] consisting of the crown, scepter, and\r\nsword of state, are preserved in the castle of Edinburgh. It is not\r\ncertainly known at what time this crown was executed. At the coronation\r\nof Robert Bruce (1274–1329) a simple circlet of gold was used; this fell\r\ninto the hands of the English after the battle of Methven in 1306. In\r\n1307 Edward I issued a pardon at the request of his “beloved Queen\r\nMargarate,” to a certain Galfredus de Coigniers, who was said to have\r\nconcealed and kept “a certain coronet of gold with which Robert the\r\nBruce, enemy and rebel of the King, had caused himself to be crowned in\r\nour own Kingdom of Scotland.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Photograph by W. & D. Downey, London\r\n\r\n  HER MAJESTY, QUEEN ALEXANDRA OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, EMPRESS OF\r\n    INDIA\r\n]\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott, in his account of the regalia, gives it as his opinion\r\nthat the present crown was probably made for Robert Bruce at a later\r\ndate, and that it was used at the coronation of his son, David II\r\n(1324–1376). The style of workmanship indicates a fourteenth-century\r\norigin. The crown was originally open and was arched over by James V\r\n(1512–1542). As Scott notes, this was done to many royal crowns in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, in order to assimilate them to the\r\ntype of the old imperial crowns.\r\n\r\nThe following description is slightly abridged from that given by Sir\r\nWalter Scott:\r\n\r\n  The lower part consists of two circles, the undermost much broader\r\n  than that which rises over it; both are of the purest gold and the\r\n  uppermost is surmounted by a range of _fleur-de-lis_ interchanged\r\n  with crosses _fleurées_, and with knobs or pinnacles of gold topped\r\n  with large pearls; this produces a very rich effect. The under and\r\n  broader circle is adorned with twenty-two precious stones, betwixt\r\n  each of which is interposed an oriental pearl. The stones are\r\n  topazes, amethysts, emeralds, rubies and jacinths; they are not\r\n  polished by the lapidary, or cut into facets in the more modern\r\n  fashion, but are set plain, in the ancient style of jewellers’ work.\r\n  The smaller circle is adorned with small diamonds and sapphires\r\n  alternately. These two circles, thus ornamented, seem to have formed\r\n  the original Diadem or Crown of Scotland, until the reign of James\r\n  V, who added two imperial arches rising from the circle, and\r\n  crossing each other, closing at the top in a mound of gold, which\r\n  again is surmounted by a large cross _patée_ ornamented with pearls\r\n  and bearing the characters J.R.V. These additional arches are\r\n  attached to the original crown by tacks of gold, and there is some\r\n  inferiority in the quality of the metal.\r\n\r\n  The bonnet or tiara worn under the crown was anciently of purple,\r\n  but is now of crimson velvet, turned up with ermine—a change first\r\n  adopted in the year 1695. The tiara is adorned with four superb\r\n  pearls set in gold, and fastened in the velvet which appears between\r\n  the arches. The crown measures about nine inches in diameter,\r\n  twenty-seven in circumference, and about six and a half in height\r\n  from the bottom of the lower circle to the top of the cross.\r\n\r\nThe scepter, made by order of James V at the time he added the arches to\r\nthe crown, is a slender silver rod about thirty-nine inches long. An\r\nantique capital of embossed leaves supports three small figures\r\nrepresenting the Virgin Mary, St. Andrew, and St. James, above which is\r\na crystal ball, surmounted by an oriental pearl.\r\n\r\nThe regalia have passed through many vicissitudes. After the execution\r\nof Charles I, his son Charles II was crowned King of Scotland at Scone\r\non January 1, 1651. On the advance of the parliamentary army into\r\nScotland, the regalia were placed in the care of the Earl Mareschal who\r\npreserved them in his castle of Dunrottar, and here they were kept until\r\nthe castle was besieged and on the point of falling into the hands of\r\nthe English. In this extremity, they were rescued by Christian Fletcher,\r\nwife of the Rev. James Granger, minister of Kinneff. She obtained\r\npermission from the English general to pay a visit to the Lady Mareschal\r\nand succeeded in carrying off the regalia. Her husband buried them in\r\nthe church of Kinneff, just in front of the pulpit. When they were\r\nbrought to light again after the Restoration, an Act of Parliament was\r\npassed which, after reciting Christian Fletcher’s services in the\r\nmatter, stated: “Therefore, the King’s Majestie, with advice of his\r\nestates in Parliament, doe appoint Two Thousand Merks Scots to be\r\nforthwith paid unto her by his Majestie’s thresaurer, out of the\r\nreadiest of his Majestie’s rents, as a testimony of their sense of her\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\nIn 1707, after the union of England and Scotland, it was considered\r\nwiser to remove the regalia from public view, since they were calculated\r\nto arouse memories of the old Scotch monarchy. These precious objects\r\nwere therefore inclosed in a chest, which was their usual receptacle,\r\nand locked up in the crown-room, a strong vaulted apartment in Edinburgh\r\nCastle. There the regalia remained until 1817, when, as doubts had been\r\nexpressed as to their existence, a commission of investigation was\r\nappointed, one of the members being Sir Walter Scott. The chest—which\r\nhad probably been the jewel-safe of the Stuarts—was forced open, and the\r\nregalia were found within, just as they had been deposited in 1707.\r\n\r\nAn imperial German crown does not exist; a design has been made and\r\naccepted, but at the present date, 1907, it has not yet been executed.\r\nOn festive occasions, when the imperial insignia are necessary, the\r\nPrussian insignia are used, especially the Prussian royal crown. This\r\nconsists of a circlet of gold set with thirteen diamonds. On this are\r\nfive leaves, each composed of three larger diamonds and a smaller one,\r\nand four prongs, each bearing a diamond and above it a large pearl. From\r\nthe five leaves start the same number of semicircular arches, tapering\r\ntoward the central point, where they unite. Each of these is set with\r\nten diamonds of decreasing size. On the center rests an imperial globe.\r\nIt consists of a large Indian-cut sapphire,—the counterpart of the one\r\non the Austrian imperial crown, evidently dating from the time of the\r\nCrusades,—and above it rises a chaplet ornamented with diamonds. The\r\ncrown has a lining of purple velvet reaching to the arches. Between the\r\narches are eight pearl pendants of an average weight of 80 grains; they\r\nare 25 millimeters in length, and have a fine, brilliant white color,\r\nalthough they are not perfectly regular in form.\r\n\r\nIn addition there belongs to the regalia a pearl necklace of three rows;\r\nthe first consists of thirty-seven pearls averaging 28 grains each; the\r\nsecond of thirty-nine pearls averaging 34 grains, and the third of\r\nforty-five pearls averaging 39 grains. There is also a guard chain of\r\n114 pearls, averaging 20 grains, making a total of 2280 grains for the\r\nchain. These pearls are also of irregular form.[452]\r\n\r\nThe crown jewels of the Sultan Abdul-Aziz (1830–1876) were of immense\r\nrichness and value. At the exhibition in Vienna, 1873, many of these\r\nwere exhibited in a building created specially for the purposes of\r\ndisplay and protection. They were in five compartments, in what might be\r\ntermed five impregnable fire-proof safes of a peculiar construction.\r\nAmong other interesting objects was the armor of Sultan Murad I\r\n(1319–1389), the founder of the Ottoman empire in Europe. This armor is\r\nof the most delicate oriental workmanship. Diamonds, pearls, and rubies\r\nare worked broadcast over it with exquisite taste.[453]\r\n\r\nIn Germany and Austro-Hungary there are many valuable ecclesiastical\r\nornaments, some of which possess great interest for the history of early\r\nGerman art. They also serve to show the appreciation of the pearl even\r\nin the Dark Ages and the Early Renaissance period.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious productions of early German art is a reliquary\r\nin the form of a sack, which is from Enger near Herford, and is\r\nexhibited in the Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin. It is set with cameos\r\nand pearls; several of the latter have dropped out; a few, however,\r\nremain in their setting. According to a very probable tradition, this\r\nreliquary was given by Charlemagne to the Saxon duke, Wittekind, on the\r\noccasion of his baptism in 785. It is of very rude and primitive\r\nworkmanship and, if we accept the tradition, it is not unlikely that it\r\nwas executed at Aix-la-Chapelle.[454]\r\n\r\nAn interesting example of German art, from the time of Archbishop Egbert\r\nof Treves (977–993), is a frame now in the Beuth-Schinkel Museum, at\r\nCharlottenburg. This was probably the framework of a portable altar. It\r\nis decorated with a simple geometrical design in the three primary\r\ncolors, and has four polished stones and four pearls on the outer border\r\nof gold filigree. Another example of the art of Treves at the time of\r\nArchbishop Egbert is the Echternacher Codex. The gold-plated cover is a\r\nworthy product of the school: ivory, enamel, and mosaic are combined in\r\nits decoration with rows of pearls. Among the representations of many\r\nsaints, appears the figure of the Empress Theophanu, daughter of the\r\nGreek emperor, Romanos II, with the inscription “Theophaniu imp.”\r\nOpposite is a youthful figure, probably that of her son, Otho III. It\r\nseems likely that the work was executed, at the command of the empress,\r\nbetween 983 and 991.[455]\r\n\r\nIn the cathedral of Treves is the portable altar known as the altar of\r\nSt. Andrew. This was primarily a reliquary and secondarily an altar. In\r\nmemory of the relic of the sandal of St. Andrew, which was greatly\r\nprized by Archbishop Egbert, this altar bears the representation of a\r\nfoot executed in wood and covered with plates of gold. The front of the\r\ncase is divided into three fields; that in the middle containing a\r\nByzantine lion in gold relief, and the others the symbols of the four\r\nevangelists in enamel work. The border is formed of rectangular pieces\r\nof enamel and smaller ones of gold, and it is set with round stones\r\nalternating with half-pearls; the ends are covered with filigree and\r\nenamel work wherein are embedded strings of pearls. A coin of Justinian\r\nII is set in the middle of the back of the case and is surrounded by a\r\nwreath of larger pearls.[456]\r\n\r\nA gold cross, the work of Rogkerus Theophilus, is in the Kunstgewerbe\r\nMuseum in Berlin, and comes from Herford. The frame, which is of wood,\r\nis covered with plates of gold; at the extremities and in the center are\r\ngroups of precious stones surrounded by pearls; at the base is a fine\r\nAugustan cameo with a wreath of pearls; the entire cross is covered with\r\nfiligree work and decorated with pearls in groups of threes. The\r\narrangement of the precious stones, and the enhancement of their beauty\r\nby means of the circles of pearls, are highly artistic. As a work of\r\nRogkerus, this cross must have been executed at the very end of the\r\neleventh century and it may be regarded as one of the finest examples of\r\nthe art of this period.[457]\r\n\r\nA very rich collection of ecclesiastical ornaments is contained in the\r\ntreasury of the cathedral of Gran in Hungary.[458] One of the most\r\ninteresting objects is a reliquary in the form of a Latin cross, which\r\nis of great historical and artistic value. An inventory made after 1528\r\ndescribes it briefly: “crux aurea continens lignum vitae” (a gold cross\r\ncontaining the wood of life). Although this reliquary probably belongs\r\nto the end of the twelfth century, the inventory of 1659 describes it as\r\na gift of King Stephen, and proceeds to say that the kings of Hungary\r\ntook their coronation oath upon it. This custom has been preserved to\r\nthe present day, and Emperor Francis Joseph, on the occasion of his\r\ncoronation as King of Hungary, June 8, 1867, swore, upon this cross, to\r\nuphold the constitution and the laws of the land. The cross is decorated\r\nwith plates of gold in filigree design, and has four en cabochon cut\r\nsapphires and eighteen oriental pearls.\r\n\r\nThe greatest treasure of the collection is known as the cross of\r\nCorvinus, King of Hungary, and is decorated with a great number of\r\npearls.[459] It is a remarkable example of early Italian Renaissance\r\nart. The entire structure is about twenty-eight inches high; the\r\npedestal is triangular and ornamented with pearls and precious stones;\r\nthree sphinxes bearing shields with the arms of Corvinus support a disk\r\nfrom which springs a triangular support sloping outward; on the three\r\nsides are mythological figures. Upon this base rests the chapel, a light\r\nGothic structure with the figure of the Saviour bound to a pillar in the\r\ncenter, and the busts of three prophets in the niches outside. Above all\r\nis the crucifix, on each side of which are figures of the Blessed Virgin\r\nand of St. John. Around the base and about each division of this\r\nelaborate design is a row of pearls; the Gothic chapel is surmounted by\r\na close-set row, and each of its six pinnacles terminates in an oval\r\npearl. The cross itself has fifteen large pearls disposed in twos and\r\nthrees, and many smaller ones. There are at least two hundred pearls on\r\nthe whole structure.\r\n\r\nAnother cross, with the arms of the primate, George Szolepchényi, and\r\nbearing the date 1667, is of pure design and richly decorated with\r\npearls and precious stones.[460] It is quite possible that this cross,\r\nwhich seems to belong to a better period, was bought by the archbishop,\r\nwho afterward added his arms. There are thirteen oriental pearls, three\r\nat the top, three at the end of each of the arms, and four at the\r\nintersection. This cross was used as an “instrumentum pacis,” for the\r\nkiss of peace, on solemn occasions such as coronations.\r\n\r\nWe may also note the pendant with the image of the Virgin Mary as\r\npatroness of Hungary, which is of gold enamel and has two pendant pearls\r\nand a sapphire, and likewise the pectoral cross of the primate, Emerich\r\nLosy; this is of gold, decorated with green, blue, and black enamel, and\r\nhas three pendant pear-shaped pearls, one quite large, as well as\r\nthirty-four smaller round pearls.\r\n\r\nAmong the many valuable and interesting objects in the treasury of the\r\nhouse and chapel of Maria Loretto am Hradschin,[461] at Prague, there is\r\na monstrance of silver-gilt, thirty-seven and a half inches high and\r\nfifteen and three quarter inches wide. It dates from the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century, and is not a harmonious whole, but only a\r\ncombination of different ornaments of precious stones, corals, and\r\nseveral hundred pearls of various sizes. All these are the devotional\r\nofferings of now unknown givers, and many of the pieces are of artistic\r\nworkmanship. This monstrance owes its origin to Josef von Bilin, who was\r\na monk of the Capuchin order and a sacristan of Maria Loretto. On\r\naccount of the many pearls which adorn it, it is known by the name of\r\nthe “Pearl Monstrance.”\r\n\r\nAnother monstrance of Arabic gold, of the year 1680, is twenty inches\r\nhigh and is studded with fifty-one pearls, of which twenty-nine surround\r\nthe disk, while the remainder are on the plate and the base. There are\r\nalso two crowns of silver-gilt for the statues of the Virgin and of the\r\nInfant Jesus. The larger of these crowns has eighteen diamonds, a ruby,\r\nand 102 pearls set in two rows; while the smaller has nineteen diamonds\r\nand a great number of pearls; both crowns are made up of the offerings\r\nof the faithful.\r\n\r\nIn a historic description of the pearls in the treasury of the Kremlin,\r\nMargeret, a Burgundian captain (“Estat de l’empire de Russie,” 1649),\r\nsays that the treasury was “full of all kinds of jewels, principally\r\npearls, for they are worn in Russia more than in the rest of Europe. I\r\nhave seen fifty changes of raiment for the emperors around each of which\r\nthere were jewels for a bordering, and the robes were entirely bordered\r\nwith pearls, some with a border of pearls measuring a foot, half a foot,\r\nor four inches in width. I have seen dozens of bed-coverings embroidered\r\nwith pearls.”[462]\r\n\r\nIn the treasury of the celebrated Troiza Monastery near Moscow, there is\r\nan immense collection of ornamental objects for ecclesiastical use, the\r\nvalue of which has been estimated at many millions of rubles. Here may\r\nbe seen miters and bishops’ crooks—many of them of solid gold and set\r\nwith precious stones—Bibles and missals in golden bindings, priestly\r\nvestments, altar-cloths, etc., all literally covered with pearls. There\r\nis also a dish filled with large pearls of enormous value.[463]\r\n\r\nThe use of fresh-water pearls in one of the most interesting\r\necclesiastical objects of antiquity is shown in the “Shrine of St.\r\nPatrick’s Gospels,” which is in the Dublin Museum. It was purchased by\r\nthe Irish Royal Academy in 1845 for £300 ($1500). This shrine, known as\r\nthe “domnach airgid,” is of Irish manufacture and was perhaps made in\r\nthe eleventh or twelfth century. It was found in the neighborhood of\r\nClones, in County Monaghan, and is ornamented with three bosses which\r\ncontained uncut crystals, and are decorated with figures of grotesque\r\nanimals and traceries enameled in blue paste; between these may be seen\r\nrepresentations of four horsemen. On each of the four corners there was\r\na fresh-water pearl, one of which still remains in its setting.\r\nAccording to George Petrie, LL.D., in his “Christian Inscriptions in the\r\nIrish Language,” the shrine bears an inscription to the effect that it\r\nwas made by John O’Barrdan at the instance of John O’Carbry, Abbot of\r\nClones, who died in 1353.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CROWN OF ST. EDWARD\r\n\r\n  The official crown of England\r\n]\r\n\r\nDr. R. F. Scharff informs us that there is also in the Dublin Museum a\r\nmodern Celtic gold brooch, presented to Queen Victoria on the occasion\r\nof her visit to Ireland in 1849, and containing a pearl of beautiful\r\nluster, discovered in Lough Esk, which is in the western part of\r\nIreland. Dr. Scharff says that this pearl is undoubtedly from the\r\n_Margaritifera margaritifera_.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Forbes Howie of Dublin writes that the shrine of O’Donnel, made\r\nin 1084, originally contained pearls. It still retains some pieces of\r\namber and coral. Mr. Howie believes that fresh-water pearls were freely\r\nused in the decoration of ancient Irish shrines.\r\n\r\nThe inventories of jewels and ornaments belonging to the kings and\r\nqueens of France, to the nobility, and to the treasures of the\r\nSainte-Chapelle, in Paris, and of the abbey and church of St. Denis, all\r\nmention a large number of objects decorated with pearls.[464] The more\r\nimportant of these are given below.\r\n\r\nThe following ornaments decorated with pearls are mentioned in the\r\ninventory of Louis, Duke of Anjou, which was made _circa_ 1360:[465]\r\n\r\n  A large silver-gilt foot for a vase or chalice, resting upon six\r\n  lions couchant, and set with groups of four pearls with a garnet in\r\n  the middle.\r\n\r\n  A half girdle of gold with a hinge bearing two ornaments, one a\r\n  balas set between two eagles. Between the ornaments is a gold bar\r\n  set with eight pearls in two rows. In front is a clasp with a large\r\n  sapphire in the middle, surrounded by two balases and two sapphires\r\n  alternating with pearls.\r\n\r\n  A gold brooch having a balas-ruby in the middle, and at each side\r\n  four sapphires and four clusters each of five quite large pearls.\r\n\r\n  A gold brooch of a very pretty design, with five balas-rubies, two\r\n  sapphires, and eight very round pearls weighing about four carats\r\n  each. At each end of the brooch is a flat pearl weighing about five\r\n  carats.\r\n\r\nThere is in the Bibliothèque Nationale[466] in Paris, the original\r\nrecord of the execution of the testament of the Comte de Montpensier,\r\nson of the Duc de Berri. This document was written in 1398, and it\r\nmentions that the sale of the jewels and plate of the count produced the\r\nsum of “2390 livres tournois 11 sols 3 deniers [about $8265].” In the\r\nrecord we have a description of “a large gold cup, weighing 5 marcs, 7\r\nounces, 1 gros [nearly 3 lbs.], whereon there is a crown of precious\r\nstones.” The decoration of the cup comprised thirty large pearls, six\r\nbalas-rubies, and four sapphires, and we are told that the Duc de Berri\r\nretained it for his own use.\r\n\r\nAn early mention of the use of pearls in rings occurs in the inventory\r\nof the Duc de Berri,[467] to whom we have just referred. This inventory,\r\nwhich was made in 1416, notes a gold ring with black enamel, set with a\r\npearl called “the great pearl of Berri.”\r\n\r\nThe inventory of the personal property of Marguerite, Countess of\r\nFlanders, the mother of the Duke of Burgundy, was made in 1405.[468] In\r\nthis inventory we have a list of an immense number of ornamental objects\r\nof every sort and kind, and everything, from the ducal crown to the\r\nsmallest trinket, is garnished with pearls. In most cases the number of\r\npearls is given, and we find that no less than 4494 are enumerated.\r\nEvidently the duchess was ever ready to honor the precious gem to which\r\nshe owed her name, and fully recognized its poetical significance. The\r\nfollowing are a few of the more noteworthy ornaments in the inventory:\r\n\r\n  The circlet of the great crown, composed of eight sections; four of\r\n  which each comprise sixteen pearls, four diamonds, and four\r\n  balas-rubies, with a sapphire in the center; the four others contain\r\n  sixteen pearls, four diamonds, and four sapphires, with a balas-ruby\r\n  in the center; beside this there are two pearls in each section.\r\n  Also, eight large fleurons of the great crown, four of which bear\r\n  each twenty-three pearls, five diamonds, three balas-rubies and a\r\n  sapphire, and the other four each twenty-three pearls, five\r\n  diamonds, four sapphires, and a balas-ruby; and eight small fleurons\r\n  of the said crown garnished each with a pearl, a sapphire, and a\r\n  balas-ruby. The whole is valued at 8724 florins ($22,682).\r\n\r\n  A gold cap with ten large ornaments fashioned like brooches, five of\r\n  which are each of six pearls and a balas-ruby, and the other five\r\n  each of five pearls and two balas-rubies, and between each ornament\r\n  there is a balas-ruby. This is appraised at 2159 florins ($5613).\r\n\r\n  A head-dress garnished with balas-rubies and sapphires and tassels\r\n  of large pearls, each of six pearls, and with a row of larger\r\n  balas-rubies, larger sapphires and larger pearls. This was estimated\r\n  at 2030 florins ($5278).\r\n\r\n  A gold necklace, enameled white and green, garnished with nine\r\n  rubies, thirteen diamonds and thirteen pearls, with a clasp of three\r\n  small rubies, and three large pearls with one large diamond in the\r\n  center. The worth of this necklace is given as 1923 florins ($5000).\r\n\r\n  The jewels and ornamental objects in this inventory are appraised at\r\n  the sum of 56,129 florins,—about $145,000,—equivalent to a much\r\n  larger sum to-day in consideration of the greater purchasing power\r\n  of money in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nIn 1480, during the reign of Louis XI, an inventory was made of the\r\nobjects preserved in the treasury of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris.[469]\r\nWe select the following items from this inventory:\r\n\r\n  A very beautiful cross, covered with gold, bearing on one side a\r\n  crystal reliquary which contained a piece of the True Cross. On\r\n  supports attached to the cross were images of the Virgin Mary and of\r\n  St. John, each holding a reliquary. The cross itself rested on a\r\n  square silver-gilt base bearing the images of the four evangelists.\r\n  The ornamentation consisted of fifty large Scotch pearls and 142\r\n  small ones, intermixed with garnets and emeralds; there were also\r\n  many balas-rubies and sapphires of different sizes. The inventory\r\n  says: “The goldsmith Nicholas Roet declares that the stones are\r\n  genuine and that the pearls are from Scotland.”\r\n\r\n  Another gold cross, resting on a silver-gilt base which bore the\r\n  arms of France and Burgundy, was decorated with fourteen sapphires,\r\n  twenty balas-rubies, and twenty-four Scotch pearls. On the base were\r\n  the figures of St. Louis and of the queen, kneeling in prayer.\r\n\r\n  Still another cross, covered with gold and of Venetian workmanship,\r\n  bore thirty-nine pearls, twenty-seven balas-rubies, and four\r\n  sapphires. A clasp attached to this cross was set with four large\r\n  perforated pearls surrounded by small emeralds and sapphires.\r\n\r\n  A silver-gilt ornament, consisting of a golden image of St. Louis\r\n  seated on a silver throne and holding in his hand a reliquary\r\n  decorated with twelve pearls, six emeralds, and six Alexandrian\r\n  rubies. The crown of the image was set with four large oriental\r\n  pearls, three balas-rubies, etc.\r\n\r\n  An ivory image of the Virgin Mary, supported by a silver-gilt base\r\n  with the arms of France. This base was borne by four lions. On the\r\n  head of the Virgin was a crown of gold adorned with eight large,\r\n  round, oriental pearls and four small ones, as well as four emeralds\r\n  and four balas-rubies. On the breast of the image was a very large,\r\n  square emerald.\r\n\r\n  A splendid miter studded with good-sized pearls and decorated with\r\n  emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and balas-rubies. The pendants were\r\n  covered with seed-pearls and precious stones.\r\n\r\n  A fine chasuble of Indian satin lined with crimson taffeta and\r\n  covered with lilies, birds, unicorns, etc., embroidered in gold and\r\n  pearls. It was also adorned with small clusters of pearls and with\r\n  two shields bearing the arms of France and Navarre, quartered.\r\n\r\n  A beautiful copy of the gospels with covers of gold, ornamented with\r\n  fourteen large sapphires, thirteen balas-rubies, two cameos, and\r\n  eighty-nine good-sized pearls.\r\n\r\nThe following items are taken from the inventory of the treasury of the\r\nabbey of St. Denis, made in 1534, during the reign of Francis I. This\r\nrecord is in the Bibliothèque Nationale, in Paris:[470]\r\n\r\n  A crown of gold, with four fleurons, garnished with several\r\n  balas-rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and pearls; valued at 59,980\r\n  crowns (about $135,000).\r\n\r\n  A golden cross and within it a piece of the True Cross which\r\n  belonged to “Jeanne d’Evreux, royne de France et de Navarre,”\r\n  valued, with the pearls that decorate it, at 345 crowns ($776).\r\n\r\n  A wooden chest containing eleven cases in which were many precious\r\n  stones and large and small pearls, both oriental and Scotch; valued\r\n  at 1858 crowns ($4180).\r\n\r\n  A number of priestly vestments embroidered with seed-pearls are\r\n  inventoried at 1200 crowns ($2700).\r\n\r\n  A blue satin chasuble bordered with pearls is valued at 350 crowns\r\n  ($787).\r\n\r\n  An altar-table, set in the “grand altar,” is described as\r\n  elaborately decorated with “arches and pillars and images of gold”\r\n  in low relief, and garnished with precious stones and pearls. The\r\n  value is given as 1203 crowns ($2700).\r\n\r\n  Another altar-table similarly ornamented is valued at 2645 crowns\r\n  ($5850). Above this table was a great cross of gold with a silver\r\n  border, called the “cross of St. Eloysius” (the patron saint of\r\n  goldsmiths); this was valued at 2291 crowns ($5154).\r\n\r\n  Over the sarcophagus containing the body of St. Denis, there was “a\r\n  large tabernacle of wood-work resembling a church, with a lofty nave\r\n  and low arches.” In this nave and in the transepts there were three\r\n  representations of sarcophagi; the whole was covered with gold,\r\n  precious stones, and pearls, and was valued at 7275 crowns\r\n  ($16,368).\r\n\r\n  The head of St. Denis, incased in gold, was borne by two silver-gilt\r\n  angels, while a third held a small shrine containing a portion of\r\n  the jaw-bone of the saint. All these objects were studded with\r\n  precious stones and pearls, and were valued at 5622 crowns\r\n  ($12,650).\r\n\r\n  There were also in the treasury several miters covered with\r\n  “ounce-pearls” and decorated with gold and silver bands; on this\r\n  field several larger pearls were set. One of these miters is valued\r\n  at 964 crowns ($2169) and another at 509 crowns ($1135).\r\n\r\n  The total value of the articles inventoried is 185,500 crowns (at\r\n  least $417,375).\r\n\r\nInventories of the property of the dukes of Lorraine, dated 1544, 1552,\r\nand 1614, mention a number of pearl ornaments. In the inventory of 1544,\r\nmade about the time of the accession of Francis I of Lorraine, we read\r\nof “a very fine case of silver-gilt around which are thirteen personages\r\nin gold, and on the lock three balases and five pearls.” The inventory\r\nof 1552, made while Charles II was duke, mentions “a cap of crimson\r\nvelvet whereon there are large pearls,” and another cap “entirely\r\ncovered with pearls.” It is, however, in the inventory of 1614, made a\r\nfew years after the accession of Henry II of Lorraine, that we find the\r\ngreatest number of items relating to pearls. An estimate of the value of\r\nthe rings and jewels was “faicte du commandement de son Altèze par\r\njouailliers et Lapidaires et Espertz dudit ars.” All these jewels were\r\nto remain forever the property of the Duchy of Lorraine. Among the items\r\nrelating to pearls, the following are worthy of note:\r\n\r\n  A gold collar with seven settings, each containing one large diamond\r\n  and two large pearls. The diamond in the center was believed to\r\n  weigh fifteen carats, and the collar was valued at 35,000 crowns\r\n  (about $70,000).\r\n\r\n  Another collar contained seven diamonds and sixteen pearls set in\r\n  pairs, and was considered to be worth 19,750 crowns (about $40,000).\r\n\r\n  A collection of one hundred large pearls, some weighing twenty\r\n  grains, some twenty-four, some twenty-eight, and a few thirty-two\r\n  grains, were estimated at 12,000 crowns ($24,000).\r\n\r\n  A large pearl, very nearly pear-shaped and almost as large as a\r\n  pigeon’s egg, was set down at 2000 crowns ($4000).\r\n\r\n  A very fine pear-shaped pearl weighing forty-eight grains was valued\r\n  at 800 crowns ($1600).\r\n\r\n  Another pear-shaped pearl weighing about thirty-two grains was\r\n  placed at 500 crowns ($1000).\r\n\r\n  Four other pear-shaped pearls, nearly as large as the one above\r\n  mentioned, were estimated at 300 crowns ($600), while a round “pearl\r\n  of Seville” was valued at only fifty crowns ($100).\r\n\r\n  Six clusters of pearls, each containing two of fourteen grains, and\r\n  four of eight grains, were thought to be worth 700 crowns ($1400).\r\n\r\n  A large chalice was decorated with seven large oriental emeralds and\r\n  eight clusters, each composed of fourteen fine, round pearls, six of\r\n  twelve grains and eight of eight grains; the whole valued at 2400\r\n  crowns ($4800).\r\n\r\n  A hat ornament composed of eleven fine rubies and ten large, round\r\n  pearls, each weighing twelve grains, was estimated at 800 crowns\r\n  ($1600).\r\n\r\n  A similar ornament, composed of thirteen rubies and fourteen pearls,\r\n  partly flat and partly round, was placed at 2000 crowns ($4000).\r\n\r\n  A collar set with seven fine rubies and the same number of round\r\n  pearls, each weighing twelve grains, and with seven other pendant\r\n  pearls, was valued at 550 crowns ($1100).\r\n\r\n  There was also a bed called the “bed of pearls,” which was\r\n  elaborately decorated with ornamentation in gold and richly studded\r\n  with pearls.\r\n\r\nThe inventory made in 1634 of the ornaments, etc., contained in the\r\nabbey of St. Denis, offers some new material and a fuller description of\r\na few of the objects mentioned in the inventory of 1534. The most\r\nnoteworthy entries are given below:\r\n\r\n  A golden scepter upon a staff of wood. The scepter bears the figure\r\n  of Charlemagne seated upon a throne; at the corners are two lions\r\n  and two eagles (one of the latter was lacking in 1634). The figure\r\n  holds a scepter in its right hand, and a globe surmounted by a cross\r\n  in its left; on its head is a crown with a large, round, oriental\r\n  pearl valued at 200 livres ($135). The throne rested on a\r\n  fleur-de-lys, beneath which was a ball of gold ornamented with eight\r\n  oriental pearls. Around the throne was the inscription: “Sanctus\r\n  Carolus Magnus Italia Roma Gallia Germania,” and three clusters of\r\n  three pearls each. The value of this scepter was given at 3300\r\n  livres, or about $2200.\r\n\r\n  The reliquary of the hand of St. Thomas. Two angels, resting on a\r\n  silver-gilt base, bore the crystal receptacle containing the relic.\r\n  The ornamentation consisted of eight clusters of four large pearls\r\n  each, with a small diamond in the center. On the hand was a gold\r\n  band bearing the inscription: “Hic est manus beati Thomae apti. quam\r\n  misit in latus domini nostri Jesu Christi.” On the hand was a\r\n  pontifical ring set with a large sapphire. The reliquary also bore\r\n  the images of St. John the Baptist, of St. Thomas, and of the Virgin\r\n  Mary. It was valued at 5590 livres, or about $3700.\r\n\r\n  A vessel made of a porphyry resembling jasper and embellished with\r\n  forty-six pearls; estimated at 1500 livres ($1000).\r\n\r\n  A cope given by Anne of Bretagne, Queen of France, and bearing six\r\n  scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary embroidered in gold and\r\n  pearls; the whole bordered with pearls and gold of Cyprus. On the\r\n  cope were the letters A and S, and the words “plutost mourir.” There\r\n  were two ounces of pearls. Valued at 2000 livres ($1350).\r\n\r\n  A vase of rock crystal, of antique workmanship, with a cover and\r\n  base of silver-gilt; the top decorated with a band of amethysts,\r\n  garnets, and sapphires, alternating with Scotch and oriental pearls.\r\n  On the base are various precious stones and twenty-three Scotch and\r\n  oriental pearls, and the inscription “Hoc vas sponsa dedit Anor.\r\n  regi Ludovico.” This vase was given by Eleanor of Aquitaine to her\r\n  husband, Louis VII of France (1137–1180), by whom it was bestowed\r\n  upon Suger, Abbot of St. Denis (1082–1152). The goldsmith work and\r\n  decoration belong to the time of Suger. The vase is now in the\r\n  Louvre.\r\n\r\n  A chalice of agate, with two handles, and engraved with the figures\r\n  of men, animals, and birds. It stood on a foot of gold adorned with\r\n  sixteen sapphires, forty-four pearls, and twenty-two clusters of\r\n  fourteen pearls each. This chalice rested upon a paten of porphyry\r\n  decorated with seven fishes inlaid in gold, and with a bordering of\r\n  pearls and precious stones disposed around the edge. Both together\r\n  valued at 25,000 livres (about $16,000).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE EMPRESS DOWAGER OF CHINA\r\n\r\n  From a portrait painted by Miss Katharine A. Carl\r\n]\r\n\r\n  A vase of agate with a foot of silver-gilt, and furnished with a\r\n  cover and a spout in the form of a serpent, both of silver-gilt.\r\n  Around the base an inscription: “Dum libare deo gemmis debemus et\r\n  auro, Hoc ego Sugerus offero vas domino” (Since we should pour\r\n  libations to God out of gems and gold, I, Suger, offer this vessel\r\n  to the Lord). This vase, which is now in the Louvre and is of\r\n  sardonyx, was enriched with many precious stones and with nineteen\r\n  Scotch and oriental pearls. The value given was 1500 livres (about\r\n  $1000).\r\n\r\n  A book beginning: “Kyrie Eleison,” with covers of wood, one overlaid\r\n  with gold and the other with silver. On the golden cover was an\r\n  ivory crucifix, and images, in ivory, of the Virgin Mary and of St.\r\n  John. The cross was bordered with seed-pearls, as were the diadems\r\n  of the images. The cover was also decorated with an engraved\r\n  crysolite, an engraved peridot, and with sapphires, emeralds, and\r\n  garnets.[471]\r\n\r\nA curious item regarding the use of pearls in embroidery is contained in\r\none of the inventories of the dukes of Burgundy, made in 1414; this\r\nreads as follows:\r\n\r\n  The sum of 276 livres 7 sols 6 deniers tournois (about $960), the\r\n  price of 960 pearls destined to ornament a dress; along the sleeves\r\n  are embroidered the words of the song “Madame, je suis joyeulx,” and\r\n  the notes are also marked along the sleeves. On each sleeve are 264\r\n  pearls which help in forming the notes of the said song, numbering\r\n  142; that is to say, a square made of four pearls for each\r\n  note.[472]\r\n\r\nMention is made in two old French documents of the use of pearls from\r\nCompiegne in ornamentation. In the “Inventaire de la royne Clémence,” in\r\n1328, we read of “a cock covered with precious stones and bearing a\r\npearl of Compiègne”; and in the “Comptes Royaux,” under date of 1353,\r\nappears this item: “For four pearls, oriental, Scotch and of Compiègne,\r\nfor the said arm-chair, 48 crowns.” As these pearls could not have been\r\nfound in Compiègne, we may suppose that there was a market for their\r\nsale in that place, which gave rise to the designation.[473]\r\n\r\nThe English authority and writer on early English silver, F. Alfred\r\nJones, communicated, under date of September, 1907, that pearls were\r\nrarely used in old English plate; in fact, any such embellishments were\r\nof exceedingly infrequent occurrence. They are, however, frequently\r\nmentioned in the inventory of the marvelous collection of gold plate\r\ndispersed by Charles I of England, which may have dated from the time of\r\nthe looting of the churches and monasteries by Henry VIII.\r\n\r\nThe following items are from the inventories of Philip II of Spain and\r\nof Margarita, wife of Philip III. The original documents are in the\r\nAustrian archives.\r\n\r\n  A golden cup which came from England. Around the foot was a wreath\r\n  of fifteen fleurons, each containing pearls, and also four St.\r\n  Andrew’s crosses comprising eighteen pearls each. The interior of\r\n  the cup showed scenes from the life of St. George and was studded\r\n  with pearls, while thirty-one pearl pendants hung from the edge.\r\n  11,897 reals (about $1700).[474]\r\n\r\nSome curious jewels, belonging to Queen Margarita, wife of Philip III of\r\nSpain, were entered in an inventory made in 1611.\r\n\r\n  An imperial eagle, full of diamonds, that came from England, with\r\n  two pendants of two pearls, which could be unhooked from the said\r\n  eagle and were worn by her Majesty at two masks as earrings. Valued\r\n  at 77,000 reals (about $11,000).\r\n\r\n  Gold earrings, enameled in various colors, with seven diamonds in\r\n  each one and three pendant pearls, two small ones of equal size and\r\n  the other shaped like a pear. Valued at 1320 reals ($188).[475]\r\n\r\nIn the older Spanish jewelry pearls were frequently entirely pierced\r\nthrough, as if they had been worn in necklaces; and if hung as drops of\r\none to three or more, they were strung on a wire, the upper end usually\r\nforming an ornament, and they were kept from falling off below by\r\nflattening the lower end of the wire, this flattening acting as a stop.\r\nThese styles have a marked resemblance to the oriental methods elsewhere\r\ndescribed, and suggest the derivation of the early Spanish pearl\r\nmounting from the Moorish occupation of the country. If they were set\r\nsingly on any part of the jewel, they were put on a wire peg fastened to\r\nit, and then the end of the wire which projected was hammered flat to\r\nkeep the pearl in place. Excellent examples of these styles are the\r\nSpanish earrings in the collection of the Hispano-American Museum of New\r\nYork. The same method was used in Transylvania in the seventeenth\r\ncentury with remarkably artistic effect.\r\n\r\nThe pearls of the Virgin of the Rosary in the church of St. Domingo,\r\nLima, were famous. It is believed that they were sold in the war of\r\nindependence. Those of the monstrance in the sanctuary of the cathedral\r\nof Lima were sold during the last war with Chile. The monstrance of the\r\ncathedral of Cuzco still shows pearls and emeralds, but they are of\r\nsmall size.\r\n\r\nA lady who left a great fortune in pearls to the church of Nazareno and\r\nthe House of the Poor of the church of St. Peter, Lima, was Doña Maria\r\nFernandez de Córdoba, from the family of Borda, grandmother to the\r\nminister of Peru in Washington. She was a descendant of Hernan Cortés\r\nand of Pizarro by her ancestor Carmen Cortés.\r\n\r\nThe pearls of Lima figure prominently in the history of the Peruvian\r\nfamilies. The war of independence, which ended in 1822, was followed by\r\nthe suppression of the entailed estates; this forced a division of the\r\nfamily fortunes, and it became necessary to sell the family jewels in\r\nEurope. Thither went all the famous pearls of the Peruvian aristocracy,\r\nwhose luxury is proven by the fact that in 1780 there were in Lima no\r\nless than two thousand private carriages.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable uses of Bohemian pearls was that of a large\r\ntriptych owned by Count Moritz of Lobkowitz and Duke of Raudnitz. It\r\nmeasured six or more feet in height. The entire borders were ornamented\r\nwith pearls. The center of the triptych represented the ascension of\r\nChrist on a chariot drawn by lambs. In the panel to the right was the\r\nAngel Gabriel, and to the left the Virgin Mary praying. The borders and\r\nlettering were magnificently embroidered and decorated in Bohemian\r\npearls. This object probably dated from the sixteenth or early part of\r\nthe seventeenth century. It was estimated by one of the authors to\r\ncontain at least one hundred thousand pearls.\r\n\r\nMadame Zelie Nuttal, the great Maya scholar, personally writes that\r\npearls are not mentioned either as articles of tribute or of decoration\r\nin ancient Mexican codices; possibly a lack of fine, hard instruments\r\nwith which to drill holes in pearls may have caused them to be\r\ncomparatively little used in personal adornment. Neither do they appear\r\nto have been found incrusted in prehistoric objects, and we have no\r\nwritten evidence of their having been used in this way. We do not know\r\nof any instances of the wearing of pearls by the Indian women, but the\r\nwomen of the higher classes used to wear them profusely, more especially\r\ndrop-earrings and pendants. Madame Nuttal also communicates as follows:\r\n\r\n  Bernadino de Sahagun states: “There are also pearls in New Spain,\r\n  and they are familiar to everybody. They are named epyollotti,[476]\r\n  which means the heart of the shell, because they are formed in the\r\n  shell of the oyster.” In Molina’s dictionary “seed-pearls” are named\r\n  “piciltic epyollotti,” which means “water-stars,” a poetical name,\r\n  composed of the word a = att = water, and cittallin = star. The\r\n  latter name leads us to infer the possibility that the “star-skirt,\r\n  or skirt of, or with stars,” the “cittallin icue” of the living\r\n  image of the goddess “Tlamateculitti” was decorated with _pearls_,\r\n  although it is only described (Book II, chap. 36) as being “of\r\n  leather, cut into strips at the bottom (forming a fringe), at the\r\n  end of each of which hung a small shell named ‘cueclitti’ which\r\n  reproduced a sound when she walked.” As it is stated that this\r\n  “star-skirt” was worn over “a white one” it seems as though it must\r\n  have been of the kind, represented in codices and sculptures, made\r\n  of openwork and netlike, and studded with round objects—possibly\r\n  pearls—at the crossings or in the centers of the open spaces.\r\n\r\nOil-paintings of the madonnas represent them with robes richly\r\nembroidered with pearls, and wearing “ropes of pearls.” The Virgin of\r\nthe Rosario, in the church at Santo Domingo, Mexico, was noted for her\r\npearls, and there is a small oil-painting of this virgin, in which she\r\nis depicted with a wealth of pearls.\r\n\r\nIn the Bohemian National Exposition, held at Prague in 1891, Count\r\nSchwarzenberg exhibited four embroideries, each fourteen by eight\r\ninches. They were embroidered with Bohemian pearls found on his domains\r\na century or more previous, and contained many thousands of pearls.\r\n\r\nIn Hungary pearls have always been the favorite jewels, especially among\r\nthe aristocracy, and they have served to adorn the national costume of\r\nboth men and women. A century ago nearly every family of distinction\r\nowned a necklace, but most of the pearls were small and of indifferent\r\nquality. Since that time fine pearls have become more usual, and many\r\nwealthy Hungarian families have acquired beautiful pearls of good size\r\nand excellent quality, and many splendid necklaces can now be seen in\r\nHungary. The following are some of the finest:\r\n\r\n  A necklace of three large rows, owned by the Archduke Joseph and\r\n  valued at one million francs.\r\n\r\n  A still larger necklace in the possession of Prince Nicholas\r\n  Esterhazy; this, however, is an entailed heirloom, and may not be\r\n  parted with without the king’s permission.\r\n\r\n  A very fine necklace of five rows, also an entailed heirloom, owned\r\n  by Count Maurice Esterhazy.\r\n\r\n  A large necklace, possessed by Countess Alois Karoly, wife of the\r\n  late ambassador in London. This is another entailed heirloom; its\r\n  value is at least a million and a half francs.\r\n\r\n  An unusually large necklace of four rows, such as one rarely sees,\r\n  owned by the Countess Wenkheim. The pearls are white, and have a\r\n  good shape, but not much brilliancy. The average size of these\r\n  pearls is approximately twenty-four grains.\r\n\r\n  An equally large necklace consisting of a single row, averaging\r\n  twenty-six grains, in the possession of Countess Louis Batthyani.\r\n\r\n  There are a great many other necklaces of fine quality, worth from\r\n  300,000 francs down to 100,000 francs, belonging to families such as\r\n  those of Count Joseph Hunyadi, Countess Festetics-Hamilton, Count\r\n  Landor Nako, Peer Leo Lanczi, Count Albert Apponyi, Mr. Eugene\r\n  Dreher, Madame Emma de Bachrach, etc., etc. Indeed, almost every\r\n  wealthy family of the better class owns a necklace worth up to\r\n  100,000 francs and over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PEARL ORNAMENTS OF THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\n          Hungarian Aigret                    Earring, Hungary\r\n      Earrings, Nijni-Novgorod                 Spanish earring\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe portraits of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries\r\nafford us many interesting evidences regarding the various forms of\r\njewelry in which pearls were used. Indeed, had we no other records,\r\nthese pictures alone would prove the great popularity of the gem as an\r\nornament.\r\n\r\nIn the finely executed portrait of the Duchess Anne de France, she wears\r\na coronet with three pearls at each point. It seems to be made up of\r\nthree large pearls, set on a row of pearls circling the entire top of\r\nher head, beneath which is a row of great emeralds, and then another row\r\nof pearls. Flaring downward and entirely covering the side of her head\r\nnear the ear, are two rows of pearls with a row of fine emeralds between\r\nthem, the rows of pearls deflecting slightly downward until the chin\r\nline is reached, and then turning back and slightly upward, meeting at\r\nthe back. As in the crown cap, the same severe decoration in pearls is\r\nthe main feature, and is repeated on each side of the robe, the front of\r\nwhich is of ermine. Beginning on a line with the shoulder is a broad\r\nband of pearls and emeralds set in gold which extends below her waist.\r\nAt the top of this are six pearls set in a straight line. Then from the\r\nend of this line, dropping straight down, is a row on each side. Between\r\nthe two rows is a gem, then two great pearls and another gem, then two\r\nmore pearls, this being repeated to below the waist. The ermine is held\r\nat her waist by a trefoil reversed; that is, two pearls above and one\r\nbelow a great gem, and then a trefoil reversed below this. This portrait\r\nis dated 1498 and is on a triptych in the cathedral of Moulins.\r\n\r\nQuite unique is the pearl decoration in a picture of St. Barbara,\r\npainted by an artist of the French school, and dated 1520, which is in\r\nthe National Museum of Budapest. This artist uses pearls with the utmost\r\nseverity of taste and richness. Beginning a trifle above the center of\r\nher forehead is an emerald ornament, and on each side there extend to\r\nthe back of her head three rows of pearls, not placed exactly one row\r\nabove the other, but the rows intertwined with each other. The whole is\r\nenriched by a great string of pearls about her neck. The effect produced\r\nis extremely artistic and beautiful.\r\n\r\nCatharine de’ Medici wore two rows of pearls on her bonnet, and a quaint\r\nnecklace in sections of two rows of four pearls, with a large pearl\r\nbetween; a pear-shaped pendant on a Renaissance jewel; a row of pearls\r\naround her low-cut bodice, and a girdle of jewels alternating with\r\npearls, which extended to the lower end of her gown. In addition to all\r\nthis, she wore a bracelet of jewels with a pearl set between each\r\nornament. This artistic combination is best shown in her portrait in the\r\nUffizi, Florence (No. 726), painted by an unknown artist.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unique, rich, and chic collections of pearls, and one\r\nworn with unusual grace, is that of the Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia,\r\nshown in the fine portrait of her by Coello Sanchez. In this portrait\r\nher hat shows the plumes embroidered with slanting rows of three, four,\r\nand five pearls. In the center of the hat is an ornament shaped like a\r\nflower, with seven large pearl petals surrounding a great pearl center.\r\nThe hat is tilted to one side showing her hair on the left, while a\r\nlittle to the right of the center of her forehead, and touching it,\r\nthere hangs from her hair a great pear-shaped pearl, which adds a\r\nwonderful amount of character to the jeweling of her head. Around her\r\nneck is a high fluted ruff; below which is a collar of large gems\r\nrelieved by an ornament of two pearls placed between each gem. The same\r\ninteresting motive is carried out in a girdle of gems which comes down\r\nvery low to her waist, terminating in a large jeweled heart ornament.\r\nThe painting shows sixteen remarkable pearls in the collar, and\r\nthirty-six pearls in the jeweled girdle.\r\n\r\nA very interesting collection of portraits was exhibited last spring\r\n(1907) at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. The pictures are\r\ncontained, in some instances, in old illuminated manuscripts, while in\r\nothers they are contemporary crayon sketches. Many pearl decorations are\r\nrepresented, and we give a few of the most important.\r\n\r\n  The portrait of Anne de Bretagne (1476–1514), wife of Louis XII,\r\n  from the “Heures d’Anne de Bretagne,” illuminated by Jean\r\n  Bourdichon, represents the queen kneeling; she wears a collar\r\n  ornamented with groups of four pearls alternating with precious\r\n  stones.\r\n\r\n  A crayon sketch of Françoise de Foix, Comtesse de Châteaubriant\r\n  (1490–1537), who became the mistress of Francis I, shows her wearing\r\n  a hood or coif ornamented with forty oval pearls. She also wears a\r\n  necklace of sixty fine round pearls.\r\n\r\n  Diane de Poitiers (1499–1566), granddaughter of Charles VII and\r\n  Agnes Sorel, is represented with a head-dress similar to that worn\r\n  by the Comtesse de Châteaubriant . It has a border of sixty round\r\n  pearls. This crayon is of the time of Jean Clouet.\r\n\r\n  A portrait of Philip Strozzi (1541–1582) who, although an Italian,\r\n  had the rank of colonel-général in the French army, is interesting\r\n  as an illustration of the wearing of earrings by the men of this\r\n  period. The fine round pearl which hangs from his ear strikes us now\r\n  as a curious ornament for a warrior.\r\n\r\n  A crayon sketch of Gabrielle d’Estrées (d. 1599), mistress of Henri\r\n  IV, is attributed to the hand of Daniel Dumonstier. Here may be seen\r\n  a splendid pearl necklace, which apparently consists of six\r\n  sections, each comprising three rows of eight round pearls, the\r\n  sections being connected with each other by a large oval pearl. The\r\n  necklace, which hangs down over the bosom, is fastened by a clasp in\r\n  the form of a four-leaved clover, from which depend two other\r\n  sections similar to those described above, and terminating in an\r\n  oval pearl pendant.\r\n\r\n  The portrait of the Duchesse de Montpensier (1627–1693), the “Grande\r\n  Mademoiselle” of Mme. de Sévigné’s letters, is from the “Maximes de\r\n  nostre salut,” dedicated to the duchess by the author, M. de la\r\n  Serre, and is attributed to Nicolas Jarry. It represents the duchess\r\n  wearing a beautiful necklace of round pearls and a large pear-shaped\r\n  pearl earring, while another pear-shaped pearl depends from a clasp\r\n  which serves to loop up her fichu on the shoulder.\r\n\r\nA fine example of the Renaissance style existing in the sixteenth\r\ncentury is that of a gold and enamel necklace of Italian workmanship,\r\nembellished with pearls. This necklace was presented to the Louvre\r\nMuseum by Don A. de Rotschildt. The two-pearl motive is carried out\r\nexquisitely, two pearls appearing in a small connecting ornament between\r\ntwo larger enameled and engraved gold plaques, which represent scenes\r\nfrom the life of our Saviour.\r\n\r\nAt the exposition of 1900 there was shown in the Russian Pavilion, a\r\nmost interesting collection of jewelry of decidedly oriental character,\r\ndating from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. These jewels were\r\nsaid to have belonged to the Emir of Bokhara. They differed slightly\r\nfrom the East Indian in character, and generally consisted of\r\ncombinations of pearls, rubies, and emeralds, the three colors of these\r\ngems predominating. One of the most interesting of the necklaces,\r\nacquired by J. Gelatley, Esq., shows an arrangement of the pearls which\r\nis peculiarly attractive and decorative.\r\n\r\nThe heraldic significance of pearls has at times been very important.\r\nWhile in the eighteenth century the crowns of the French nobles were\r\nsurmounted with silver points, it appears that in the sixteenth century\r\nthey were provided with pearl points. According to Rudolphus,[477] the\r\ndukes wore a leaf crown of eight leaves, with or without as many\r\ncommingled pearl points; the marquises a crown of four leaves with\r\ntwelve pearl points, or with four groups of three pearls set one over\r\nthe other; and the counts, a pearl crown which sometimes had four pearls\r\nin each corner, one above the other. The viscounts wore a gold ring set\r\nwith four pearls, and the barons a gold ring entwined with pearls.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the English coronets. Instead of the pearls which\r\nthey bore at an earlier period, silver balls are now used on those of\r\nthe English barons, viscounts, earls, and marquises. This change\r\nprobably owed its origin to the desire on the part of the sovereigns to\r\nconfine the official use of pearls and other precious stones to\r\nthemselves. The rules at the coronation of Edward VII forbade the use of\r\npearls except as a special royal privilege. The earl’s coronet has eight\r\nballs raised on points, with gold strawberry leaves between the points.\r\nThe marquis wears one with four gold strawberry leaves and four silver\r\nballs alternating, the latter raised above the rim.[478]\r\n\r\nA pearl and gold ring, formerly belonging to Washington, is now in the\r\npossession of Vice-Chancellor E. B. Learning, of Camden, N. J. It bears\r\nin the center a lock of Washington’s hair under a conical glass, around\r\nwhich is a setting of blue and white enamel with a square of red at each\r\ncorner. The whole is surrounded by a circle of thirteen pearls. This\r\nring was presented by Washington to Lieutenant Richard Somers prior to\r\nthe latter’s departure on the expedition against the Algerine pirates in\r\nTripoli, in the course of which he lost his life. Before his departure\r\nhe left the ring with his sister, Sarah Keen. Vice-Chancellor Leaming’s\r\npaternal grandmother inherited it as heir to Somers’s estate, and from\r\nher it descended successively to her son and grandson. The lock of\r\nWashington’s hair is admitted to be one of only three now existing, of\r\nthe other two, one is at Washington’s headquarters at Newburg and the\r\nother in the museum at Boston. The ring was exhibited at the Centennial\r\nExposition in 1876.\r\n\r\nAnd what a wealth of pearls was seen at the marriage of the late Emperor\r\nFrederick III of Germany with Princess Victoria, in 1858! The wedding\r\ngift of the bridegroom consisted of a necklace of thirty-six enormous\r\npearls, three superb ones in the middle, and graduated in size toward\r\nthe ends. From her mother, Queen Victoria, the bride received a diamond\r\nnecklace and three massive brooches set with unusually large pearls; and\r\nfrom Prince Albert, a magnificent hair-net of pearls, diamonds, and\r\nemeralds. The king and queen of Prussia presented a diadem of brilliants\r\nsurrounded with a splendid circlet of pearls. On the day of her entry\r\ninto Berlin, the queen bestowed on the bride a costly brooch of pearls\r\nand diamonds, representing a bouquet, the leaves of which consisted of\r\ndiamonds, while the flowers themselves were of pear-shaped pearls of\r\nlarge size, one weighing 160 grains, and fourteen of them weighing 600\r\ngrains together.\r\n\r\nOne of the most splendid and best known collection of pearls, and one\r\nworn with as much grace as any in Europe, consists of those owned by the\r\ndowager Queen Margherita of Italy, whose name signifies pearl, and who\r\nhas always been fond of the ocean jewel. Her husband, King Humbert, made\r\nher many presents of this regal gem. A photograph, signed by the queen\r\nand sent to us for this volume by her gracious courtesy, shows her\r\nwearing her magnificent twelve strings of pearls, a pearl bracelet, and\r\na pearl tiara with pear-shaped pearl tips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MARGHERITA, DOWAGER QUEEN OF ITALY\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the coronation of Edward VII and Queen Alexandra, beside her\r\ncoronation crown, the latter wore many of her richest and most beautiful\r\njewels. These consisted of seven immense rows of pearls, each\r\ntwenty-four to thirty inches in length, hanging below five large neck\r\ncirclets of diamonds and a great corsage ornament which covered her\r\nentire bodice; and beneath part of this was a splendid ornament of\r\ndiamonds with large, pear-shaped pearls.\r\n\r\nA careful study of the decorations conferred by potentates and\r\ngovernments shows that the pearl is rarely used in the ornamentation of\r\nthese marks of distinction. A notable exception is that given by the\r\nSiamese government. This decoration is known as the nine-jewel Siamese\r\ndecoration, and bears a large center pearl. It is only conferred on nine\r\nmembers of the royal Siamese family, including his Majesty the King of\r\nSiam. The central pearl represents the king and the eight other jewels\r\nsurrounding it the members of his family. It is strange that Siam should\r\nfind so much significance in white, as is illustrated by the white\r\nelephant, and also by the use of the white pearl for this order.\r\n\r\nThe Order of Christ, the chief Portuguese order, has a long cross\r\nenameled in bright red surcharged with a white cross and bordered with\r\nfine pearls. The effect is both striking and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe order of the crown of India is a jeweled badge with a device\r\ncomposed of the imperial cipher, E. R. and I., in diamonds, pearls, and\r\nturquoises, set within a border of pearls and surmounted by the imperial\r\ncrown.[479]\r\n\r\nA remarkable pearl necklace was recently the subject of litigation in\r\nEngland. It was the property of the late Duchess of Sermonata, an\r\nEnglishwoman who married an Italian. She was a daughter of the late Lord\r\nHoward de Walden, one of the wealthiest of the English nobility. The\r\nduchess was in the habit of investing all her spare cash in pearls, and\r\nit seems that she chose a very good form of investment, since pearls\r\nhave increased in value to a greater extent even than diamonds during\r\nthe same period. Of the ten rows of which this necklace consisted, six\r\nwere deposited for safekeeping in a London bank and the other four were\r\nin Florence at the time of the death of the duchess. She had bequeathed\r\nthe gems at the bank to her niece, Miss Henrietta Ellis, and had left\r\ndirections that, if her pearl necklace was in London when she died, it\r\nshould be sent to her Italian executors. All the jewels are now claimed\r\nby these executors, while Miss Ellis contends that it was the intention\r\nof the duchess to leave to her the pearls in the hands of the London\r\nbankers. The necklace consisted at one time of ten rows; the first,\r\nthirteen and a half inches long, comprised forty-one pearls; the second,\r\nfourteen inches in length, thirty-nine pearls; the third, fourteen and a\r\nhalf inches, forty-three pearls; the fourth, seventeen inches,\r\nforty-seven pearls; the fifth, seventeen and a half inches, forty-nine\r\npearls; the sixth, nineteen and a half inches, fifty-five pearls; the\r\nseventh, twenty-one inches, sixty-six pearls; the eighth, twenty-three\r\nand a half inches, seventy pearls; the ninth, twenty-six inches,\r\neighty-two pearls; the tenth, twenty-nine and a half inches, ninety-one\r\npearls. The total number of pearls is 583, and the necklace is valued at\r\n$150,000.\r\n\r\nA widely advertised necklace of large size was shown in the English\r\nsection of the Paris Exposition of 1900. This necklace consisted of\r\nforty-six pearls weighing 1596 grains, and was valued at $450,000. It\r\nwas loaned by an English gentleman now dead, and was returned to him at\r\nthe close of the exposition and later dispersed.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the possession of pearls by families in the United States,\r\nwe may safely say that there is not a letter in the alphabet under which\r\nwe cannot find the names of from one to a dozen families, owning single\r\nstrings or collections from the value of $10,000 to $200,000, or even\r\nmore. If one is a wearer of jewels, pearls are an absolute necessity;\r\nindeed, they are as essential and indispensable for the wealthy as are\r\nhouses, horses, and automobiles. At no period in the world’s history\r\nhave pearls been more widely distributed; and some of those of to-day\r\nare finer in quality and orient, and also more carefully matched, than\r\nthose in the great collections of the past. Of course there are\r\nexceptions, where royal personages have been careful observers and have\r\nused good taste, but it is a question whether there have ever been more\r\ncritical or better buyers, as far as selection is concerned, than are\r\nmany American men and women who have purchased this gem.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest pearl necklaces in the United States is in the\r\npossession of an American lady. There are perhaps thirty pearls in the\r\nnecklace, weighing in all about 1400 grains; the largest pearl weighs\r\nnearly 120 grains. There is also one of 75 grains and one of 70 grains,\r\nthe others graduating down to 20 grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COLLECTION OF BLACK PEARLS BELONGING TO AN AMERICAN LADY\r\n]\r\n\r\nWith increasing wealth, and a demand for rich rather than gaudy or showy\r\njewelry, there is nothing that commends itself so highly as the pearl,\r\nwhich acts as a foil to the diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire, and at\r\nthe same time harmonizes with them and in fact with all the colored\r\nstones. The true pearl, as it increases in size and beauty, becomes\r\nproportionately more rare and costly; and yet it differs from other\r\njewels in the fact that they are mined in the depths of the earth, and\r\ntheir existing quantity is speculative, while the home of the pearl is\r\nmuch more accessible, and it is possible to make an estimate of the\r\nnumber of pearls in course of growth. Pearls, however, are forming all\r\nthe time, while other gems are perhaps to-day as they were ages before\r\nthe advent of man. Nevertheless, even if pearls were cultivated as they\r\nshould be, and people cared for the mollusks as the oyster-gatherer does\r\nfor his crop—by planting it, guarding it and gathering it\r\nsystematically—still, the ever-increasing demand would more than balance\r\nthe greater supply. As we have said, at no time since pearls were worn\r\nhave they enjoyed such favor; and while they have always increased in\r\nvalue, this increase has never been so rapid as in the past ten years.\r\nThey are jewels which can be worn by young or old, and which adapt\r\nthemselves to every fabric that man or woman can use for attire; whether\r\nthey are white, gray, or black, they are never obtrusive, but always\r\nhave a refining effect. Round as the globe upon which we live, they will\r\nprobably be worn and appreciated as long as life exists upon this\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the change of taste and the difference of\r\nopinion, at various epochs, in regard to the respective merits of\r\npear-shaped and round pearls. In the Roman period the pear-shaped pearls\r\nwere more highly valued; in the eighteenth century round pearls were\r\nesteemed the more valuable, while at the present day they are both on\r\nabout the same basis.\r\n\r\nWith the progressive twentieth century taste for independence in\r\nfashion, our modern ladies take from every epoch what they think will\r\nbest suit their superrefined beauty. Therefore we are not surprised to\r\nfind in their jewel-cases the long earrings and large brooches adorned\r\nwith seed-pearls, similar to those worn by their grandmothers of the\r\nearly Victorian period. Although these jewels cannot be considered very\r\nbeautiful according to the artistic standard of to-day, they,\r\nnevertheless, lend to their wearers a certain quaint dignity and\r\npiquancy which is very attractive.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of modern pearl-wearing by a lady of the present century,\r\nwe may note a portrait in which there is a simple necklace of large\r\npearls; over this a collar of twenty-three rows of pearls with a diamond\r\ncenterpiece, and to relieve the severity, a sautoir, which is made up of\r\nalternate pearls and diamonds, and pearl earrings. No better\r\nillustration can be given than the portrait of Señora Carmen Romero\r\nRubio de Diaz, wife of President Porfirio Diaz of Mexico, which, by her\r\ncourtesy, we are able to figure.\r\n\r\nThe gathering of a great necklace is not the work of a day; it often\r\nrequires many years. Such necklaces are frequently held for a long time\r\nby dealers or by a number of people who are interested in their sale,\r\nand whenever one or more pearls can be purchased which form a better\r\ngraduation or which are of better color or more perfect, they are\r\nusually purchased to improve the necklace if the price is a proper one.\r\n\r\nIn the early sixties, when most American women aspired to owning a pair\r\nof diamond earrings, it was not uncommon for ladies to start with a\r\nhundred, two hundred, five hundred, or a thousand-dollar pair, and, for\r\na dozen years to come, to add an annual sum of one hundred, two hundred\r\nor five hundred dollars to increasing the size of these by exchanging\r\nthem with the dealer at the cost price and paying the difference between\r\nthe value of the pair that had been purchased and that of the new pair.\r\nIn this way ladies who never would have thought of spending five\r\nthousand dollars for a pair of earrings, virtually made a savings-bank\r\nof the jewels. This is frequently done with pearls. A small necklace or\r\na few pearls will be purchased; these are added to annually or at such\r\ntimes as the owner may have spare savings or gifts to invest. It is not\r\nuncommon for a family to buy a pearl for a daughter on her first\r\nbirthday, and each succeeding year add one pearl to this, so that she\r\nmay first wear one pearl, then two, then three, and by the time the\r\nyoung lady makes her début in society, a good start has been made toward\r\na pearl necklace. It was the custom of King Humbert of Italy to present\r\nhis queen, Margherita, with one fine pearl every year, and with this\r\nsuccession of annual gifts she possessed one of the finest collections\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the portraits of the four daughters of the present Czarina of Russia,\r\nthe Grand Duchesses Tatiana, Olga, Maria, and Anastasia, we can see that\r\ntheir pearl necklaces were built up gradually, as that of the eldest\r\ndaughter is notably longer than those of her younger sisters. These\r\npearls were annual gifts from the Czar and Czarina and from others of\r\nthe imperial family.\r\n\r\nThere are few ornaments worn by man or woman that have not at one time\r\nor another been bepearled, either with large or small pearls, with one\r\npearl or many pearls, with pearls of high or low degree, and no object\r\nis ever made the less rich by the addition of the peerless gem of the\r\nocean depths.\r\n\r\nAs the prices of pearls have increased, naturally the single objects\r\ncontaining them have also become more costly. It is not unusual to see\r\nrings with pearls each costing from $5000 to $10,000, $20,000, and even\r\n$30,000 and over, the pearls not infrequently being in button form.\r\n\r\nRings are occasionally made up of one white and one black oriental\r\npearl, and if a pink one is combined with these, it is either a\r\nfresh-water or a conch pearl. Such rings sell for $5000, $8000, $10,000\r\nand $15,000 each.\r\n\r\nPendant pearls, either round, ovate, drop, or pear-shaped, sell from\r\n$5000 to $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and even $100,000.\r\n\r\nThe prices for one or two choice pearls worn for the adornment of a\r\nman’s shirt-front are $2000, $3000, $5000, and even $10,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SENORA CARMEN ROMERO RUBIO DE DIAZ, WIFE OF PRESIDENT PORFIRIO DIAZ OF\r\n    MEXICO\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn link buttons, slightly ovate, button or round pearls are used, the\r\nlink being made up of one white and one black pearl, costing $2000,\r\n$3000, $5000, and even $20,000 a set.\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual for a man to wear a scarf-pin set with a round, ovate,\r\nor pear-shaped pearl costing $2000, $5000, $10,000, $15,000, and even\r\n$30,000.\r\n\r\nFor men’s scarf-pins, a variety of colors are frequently selected, such\r\nas a white oriental, a pink American, a pink conch, or a gray and black\r\noriental pearl.\r\n\r\nSingle pearl necklaces sell for $1000, $2000, $5000, $8000, $10,000,\r\n$15,000, $20,000, $50,000, $100,000, $250,000, and $500,000 necklaces\r\nare not unknown.\r\n\r\nTiaras sell for $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and $100,000.\r\n\r\nWaistcoat buttons, sometimes made up of baroque pearls, cost from $200\r\nto $500; sometimes, however, when fine pearls are used, the price paid\r\nfor a set of five or six buttons is as high as $10,000.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to mention all the various forms in which the\r\npearl has been worn: whether as a spray of many small pearls or a few\r\nlarge ones, either round, ovate, or pear-shaped for aigrets; in points\r\non crowns, used either for ornamental or heraldic purposes; for the\r\ndecoration of the orbs, scepters, and crowns of kings and emperors; for\r\nforming an edging on bonnets, caps, fillets, or diadems; in pendant\r\nform, usually consisting of one, although sometimes of three or four\r\npendants in rows and lines to ornament the side of the face; or one,\r\ntwo, three, or a bunch together to adorn the ear; as a single pearl on a\r\nwire or a group of them, as worn in the nose of the East Indian beauty;\r\nas a single, two, three, or many-rowed necklace to grace the lady, the\r\nqueen, and the empress; or else in six, ten, to twenty or more rows with\r\na tiny gold jeweled bar, or a large diamond center, in the form of\r\ncollars; as a long chain from four to ten feet long to hang from the\r\nneck to the waist, or else to be worn once, twice, or thrice around the\r\nneck, hanging down and then encircling the waist in the form of a\r\nsautoir; either as a single drop, consisting of an ovate or pear-shaped\r\npearl or a number of them together in the form of a pendant combined\r\nwith diamonds; as a single pearl surrounded with pearls or diamonds for\r\nbuttons to adorn my lady’s crown; in rows, or combined with jewels and\r\nenamel, in the form of a bow-knot with long bunches of pearls, for\r\nshoulder bars; either as one pearl alone or alternating with gold wire,\r\nwith jewels, or with many pearls, in endless forms, as bracelets; either\r\nas a single row, two rows or alternate rows in infinite variety on\r\nbodices, as worn in the past more than at the present; in a single row\r\non ornamenting metal, enamel, or jewelwork in the form of girdles; in\r\nfive hundred forms for rings; as an embroidery or in rows pendant on\r\nslippers; and, finally, as a stole. These are only a few of the uses to\r\nwhich a lady can put pearls.\r\n\r\nBy men, pearls are worn to adorn the shirt, to wear in the scarf, as\r\nlink buttons, as waistcoat buttons, or as a fob. The pearls used in this\r\nway are sometimes quite as expensive as any of those worn by the ladies.\r\n\r\nEcclesiastics, for more than two thousand years, have appreciated the\r\nrichness of bepearling. In Russia we find pearls decorating crosses,\r\nmissal covers, vestments, bindings on books, chalices and crook-tops;\r\nthey are employed as borders to ikon frames, or for the decoration about\r\nthe Madonna and Child. In Persia we find pearl-embroidered rugs,\r\npillows, and bolsters. Half-pearls are used in quaint decorations for\r\nwatches, snuff-boxes, miniatures, and portrait frames. Even saddles and\r\nhorse-trappings in the East do not escape the charm and beauty of the\r\npearl. Even the English coronation spoon is known for the pearls which\r\nornament it.\r\n\r\nOf the many forms of earrings that have come down to us, none is simpler\r\nor daintier than a single pearl worn as an ear-screw, or partly or\r\nentirely strung on a thin gold wire. Another dainty style is three\r\npearls, worn one below the other as in ancient Rome, known as a triclum;\r\nor the round pearl with a pear-shaped pendant or bunches of pearls known\r\nas crotalia, also worn in ancient times.\r\n\r\nA pearl necklace is usually clasped either by a round or ovate pearl,\r\ndrilled so that the catch and snap are contained within the pearl\r\nitself, or else by a pearl surrounded by diamonds, rubies, or other\r\ngems. Such a clasp frequently serves to bind from two to fifteen rows of\r\npearls, the first or smaller row encircling the neck, and each row in\r\nturn being larger until the fifteenth row reaches to the bosom or even\r\nto the waist.\r\n\r\nPearl collars are usually made up of four, six, ten, twenty, and even\r\ntwenty-five rows; often of very small pearls, generally fitting closely\r\nto the neck. The pearls are held in position either by four gold,\r\ndiamond, or jeweled bars, or frequently the entire front of the collar\r\nis occupied by a large diamond ornament.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times, pearls were a favorite decoration of crosses;\r\nfrequently an entire cross was made up of pearls, either of a single or\r\na double row. Many portraits dating from the fifteenth to the\r\nseventeenth century show the cross used in connection with a necklace,\r\nthis either starting from the top of the cross or from each side at the\r\nend of each arm. Sometimes from below the arms and the lower part of the\r\ncross there hung pendant either round or pear-shaped pearls. We have\r\nother instances where at the top, the cross was attached to a pearl\r\nnecklace, while below each of the two arms there hung a pearl, and from\r\nthe lower part of the cross a double necklace again reached to the back\r\nof the neck. Frequently a festoon collar will be made up of five rows of\r\npearls, each of a graduated length, and pendant on each a diamond.\r\nRecently pearls have been drilled and invisibly joined by fine platinum\r\nlinks, so as to form a continuous ribbon or even a collar two inches\r\nwide; occasionally, a Greek border or some other design, of larger\r\npearls or of diamonds, rubies, sapphires or other gems, is interwoven.\r\nThis constitutes a veritable, smooth pearl cloth, or pearl mesh, very\r\nbeautiful and also comfortable to wear. Indeed, a purse, measuring five\r\nby six inches, has been made of this cloth of pearls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Jade jar inlaid with pearls set with fine gold\r\n\r\n  Heber R. Bishop Collection, Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Japanese decoration set with pearls\r\n\r\n  Order of the crown of the First Class. Metropolitan Museum of Art\r\n]\r\n\r\nDust-pearls, too minute to drill, and numbering over 100,000 to the\r\nounce, were used, in the latter part of the eighteenth and the early\r\npart of the nineteenth centuries, for the embellishment of the hair-work\r\nthen so much in favor and which was placed under glass. Where foliage\r\nwas represented the leaves were made of the most minute seed-pearls,\r\ngraduated in size and set on an outline of enamel or white paint, the\r\npearls being cemented to the outline. This added a softness to the\r\nhair-work and other decoration.\r\n\r\nAs long as the pearl has been known, there has been a desire to obtain\r\npossession of one in some of its degrees of perfection, and for this\r\nreason many attempts have been made to prepare something that might pass\r\nfor a pearl or even suggest a pearl. Sometimes the mother-of-pearl shell\r\nhas, naturally, a protuberance, either round or pear-shaped, which, if\r\ncut off and highly polished may resemble an imperfect pearl; and this\r\noperation is often so cleverly performed that, at the first glance, this\r\nobject may pass for a true pearl. In Russia, and especially in Bohemia,\r\nthey have gone farther than this. They have cut out a bit of\r\nmother-of-pearl shell, leaving a piece of the natural shell for the top,\r\nor the part that will be visible, and rounding off the rest of the\r\nsurface so as to give it a pearly effect. These objects are of trifling\r\nvalue and are used in necklaces and earrings, and in the ornamentation\r\nof icons and miniature frames and even as beads. Glass with either an\r\nexterior or interior coating of a nacreous substance is sometimes made\r\nabsolutely round, while at other times it is made with many\r\nimperfections so as to resemble either a marine baroque or a fresh-water\r\nirregular pearl. The North American Indian, as described elsewhere, has\r\ncoated little balls of clay with a powder made from a pearl-bearing\r\nfresh-water mussel and then baked them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI\r\n\r\n                     FAMOUS PEARLS AND COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  XVI\r\n                     FAMOUS PEARLS AND COLLECTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n  The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly\r\n  pearls: who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and\r\n  sold all that he had and bought it.\r\n\r\n                                          _St. Matthew_, XIII, 45, 46.\r\n\r\nIn the course of twenty centuries many pearls and pearl collections have\r\nbecome famous, either because of their intrinsic value or else through\r\nhistoric associations. An attempt is made here to list briefly the more\r\nimportant of these. While we have purposely omitted any mention of the\r\npearl collections in private hands at the present time, some of which\r\nare more valuable than many of those noted in the following pages, we\r\nhave, nevertheless, given the principal sales of pearls at auction\r\nduring the past twenty years. Many specimens of remarkable size and\r\nbeauty have changed hands in this way, more especially in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEOPATRA PEARLS. Next to that “pearl of great price,” mentioned by\r\nChrist, probably the most famous of all pearls were the two which Pliny\r\nrecords as having been worn in the ears of Cleopatra, “the singular and\r\nonely jewels of the world and even Nature’s wonder.” This writer does\r\nnot note their size, but estimates their value at sixty million\r\nsestertii. We have already quoted the passage in which Pliny relates how\r\none of these pearls was dissolved and swallowed by Cleopatra in order to\r\nwin a wager she had made with Antony. After the death of that queen the\r\nother pearl “was cut in twaine, that in memoriall of that one halfe\r\nsupper of theirs, it should remaine unto posterite, hanging at both the\r\neares of Venus at Rome in the temple of Pantheon.”[480] Budé estimated\r\nthe value of the pearl dedicated to Venus at 250,000 _escus_ of\r\ngold.[481]\r\n\r\nAnother famous pearl mentioned by Pliny was the one which Julius Cæsar\r\npresented to Servilia, mother of Brutus, the value of which he notes as\r\nsix million sestertii.[482]\r\n\r\n\r\nPEROZ PEARL. The historian Procopius,[483] of the sixth century, tells\r\nof a magnificent pearl which belonged to Peroz, or Firuz (459–484), one\r\nof the Sassanian kings of Persia. In the course of his disastrous battle\r\nwith the White Huns, in which both he and his sons perished, Peroz,\r\nhaving a presentiment of the misfortune about to befall him, took the\r\npearl from his right ear and cast it away, lest any one should wear it\r\nafter him. This pearl is described as being “such as no king had ever\r\nworn up to that time.” Procopius, however, thinks it more probable that\r\nthe ear of Peroz was cut off in the combat, and he states that the\r\nemperor (Zeno, 426–491) was very anxious to buy the gem from the Huns,\r\nbut that all search for it was in vain. Nevertheless, a rumor was\r\ncurrent that it was recovered later, but that another pearl was\r\nsubstituted for it and sold to Kobad, a successor of Peroz.\r\n\r\nA different version is given by Panciroli,[484] who quotes Zonaras, a\r\nByzantine historian of the twelfth century, as his authority. According\r\nto this version Justinian the Great, who succeeded to the throne\r\nforty-three years after the death of Peroz, offered one hundred pounds\r\nof gold (about $25,000) for the pearl, but the barbarians refused to\r\npart with it, preferring to keep it as a memorial of Persian folly. On\r\nthe coins of Peroz he is represented wearing an earring with three\r\npendants, one of which may have been this wonderful pearl.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES THE BOLD. One of the greatest jewels of the fifteenth century\r\nwas that belonging to Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy (1433–1477).\r\nAccording to notes and drawings[485] made in 1555 by J. J. Fugger of\r\nNuremberg, who was the banker jeweler of his generation, this consisted\r\nof a large pyramid diamond five eighths of an inch square at the base,\r\nwith the apex cut as a four-rayed star in relief; surrounding this were\r\nthree rectangular pyramid-shaped rubies and three magnificent\r\npear-shaped pearls, and a large ovate pearl was suspended from the\r\nlowest ruby. The pear pearls are described as measuring half an inch in\r\ndiameter and must have weighed about sixty grains each. This magnificent\r\njewel was probably the most celebrated in Europe during the fifteenth\r\ncentury. According to Comines, on the defeat of the Grand Duke and the\r\nplundering of his baggage by the Swiss at Granson in 1476, the ornament\r\nwas found by a careless soldier who tossed it away, but retained the\r\ngold box containing it. On second thought, he searched for and recovered\r\nthe jewel and sold it to a priest for one florin, and the ecclesiastic\r\nsold it to a Bernese government official for the sum of three florins.\r\nSome years later this jewel, together with the ducal cap of Charles the\r\nBold, which was covered with pearls, and bore a plume case, set with\r\ndiamonds (points), alternating with pearls and balas-rubies, was sold by\r\nthe Bernese government to Jacob Fugger, as related by J. J. Fugger in\r\nthe manuscript above noted, “for no more than 47,000 florins.” In the\r\nvain hope that it would be purchased by Emperor Charles V, grandson of\r\nCharles the Bold, Fugger held the jewel for many years, but he broke up\r\nthe cap and reset the stones in it for Maximilian II. The brooch was\r\nfinally sold to Henry VIII of England just before his death, and it\r\npassed to his daughter and successor, Bloody Mary, who presented it to\r\nher Spanish bridegroom, Philip. Thus, after seventy-six years, the jewel\r\nwas restored to a descendant of the original owner. This history has\r\nbeen given at some length owing to its illustration of the manner in\r\nwhich great pearls were easily lost on battle-fields and were passed\r\nabout from one country to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GAIKWAR OF BARODA, 1908\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nTARAREQUI PEARLS. The early American fisheries yielded several\r\nmagnificent pearls, many of which eventually became part of the imperial\r\nSpanish jewels. Prominent among these was the _Huerfana_ or _Sola_.\r\nAccording to Gomara, this was secured in 1515 from the Indians at\r\nTararequi, in the Gulf of Panama, in a large collection which weighed\r\n880 ounces. It was pear-shaped and weighed thirty-one carats. Gomara\r\nstates that this pearl was purchased from Gaspar de Morales, leader of\r\nthe Spanish expedition, by a merchant, for the sum of 12,000 castilians.\r\n“The purchaser could not sleep that night for thinking on the fact that\r\nhe had given so much money for one stone, and sold it the very next day\r\nto Pedrarias de Avila, for his wife Donna Isabel de Bovadilla”; and\r\nafterward it passed to Isabella, wife of Emperor Charles V (1500–1558).\r\nIt was remarkable for its luster, color, and clearness, as well as for\r\nits size. Another large pearl in this collection weighed twenty-six\r\ncarats.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVIEDO PEARL. As already noted on page 237, in his “Historia natural y\r\ngeneral de las Indias,” published at Toledo in 1526, Gonzalo de Oviedo\r\nwrote of having purchased at Panama a pearl weighing twenty-six carats\r\nfor which he paid 650 times its weight in fine gold, and which he\r\nclaimed was the “greatest, fairest and roundest” that had ever been seen\r\nat Panama. Probably this was the twenty-six-carat pearl obtained at\r\nTararequi by Gaspar de Morales in 1515. At 650 times its weight in gold\r\nthe value of this pearl would be $2294.54; representing a base of $.2124\r\nper grain; but at a base of $5 per grain the same pearl would be worth\r\n$54,080, equaling 15,320 times its weight in gold.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPLE OF TALOMECO. Among great collections of pearls, some writers\r\nwould place that described by Garcilasso de la Vega as having been found\r\nby De Soto and his followers in 1540 in the Temple of Talomeco near the\r\nSavannah River in America.[486] According to Garcilasso, the quantity of\r\npearls there was so great that 300 horses and 900 men would not have\r\nsufficed for its transportation, vastly excelling every other if not all\r\nother collections in the history of the world. Unfortunately the\r\naccuracy of this account has not been unquestioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA PEREGRINA. Most celebrated among the early American pearls was La\r\nPeregrina (the incomparable), or the Philip II pearl, which weighed 134\r\ngrains. According to Garcilasso de la Vega, who says that he saw it at\r\nSeville in 1597,[487] this was found at Panama in 1560 by a negro who\r\nwas rewarded with his liberty, and his owner with the office of alcalde\r\nof Panama. Other authorities note that it came from the Venezuelan\r\nfisheries in 1574. It was carried to Spain by Don Diego de Temes, who\r\npresented it to Philip II (1527–1598). Jacques de Treco, court jeweler\r\nto the king, is credited with saying that it might be worth 30,000,\r\n50,000 or 100,000 ducats, as one might choose to estimate, for in fact\r\nit was so remarkable as to be beyond any standard valuation. If we can\r\ncredit Garcilasso, at one time this pearl decorated the crown of the\r\nBlessed Virgin in the church of Guadeloupe, which was resplendent with\r\ngems.[488] A contemporaneous account[489] notes that it was worn at\r\nMadrid by Queen Margarita, wife of Philip III, at the fêtes given in\r\ncelebration of the treaty of peace between that country and England in\r\n1605.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES II PEARL. Somewhat similar to the foregoing was the pearl of\r\nCharles II of Spain (1661–1700), which was presented to that monarch by\r\nDon Pedro de Aponte, Conde del Palmer, a native of the Canaries. This\r\ngem was found in 1691, or more than a century after La Peregrina. These\r\ntwo pearls were nearly equal in size, and for many years they were worn\r\nas earrings by the successive queens of Spain. It is reported that they\r\nwere destroyed in 1734, when a large portion of the old palace at Madrid\r\nwas burned.[490]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS\r\n\r\n  The property of the Earl of Leven and Melville. About 1559–1560\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe jewels of the Spanish crown have passed through so many vicissitudes\r\nthat it is not surprising that but few of them remain in the Spanish\r\ntreasury. After the overthrow of the Spanish monarchy by the French in\r\n1808, Ferdinand VII, during the time of his exile, disposed of many of\r\nthese jewels. It is asserted that, after the deposition of Queen\r\nIsabella, in 1868, the crown jewels were divided between herself and her\r\nsister, the pious Duchesse de Montpensier, and a considerable portion\r\nwas eventually distributed among the numerous descendants of the latter.\r\nIt is also stated that there is no mention of the Spanish crown jewels\r\nduring the reign of King Amadeus, the first sovereign of the restored\r\nmonarchy. There are, however, great quantities of pearls and other gems\r\nbelonging to the various madonnas in the Spanish churches, as, for\r\nexample, Nuestra Señora de Atocha, Cavadonga and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARLS OF MARY STUART. The pearls owned by the unfortunate Mary Queen of\r\nScots (1542–1587) were among the most beautiful in Europe. Inventories\r\nof these[491] show great _bordures de tour_ of large pear pearls with\r\n_entredeux_ of round pearls, long ropes of pearls strung like beads on a\r\nrosary, carcans or broad belts set with pearls, and a large number of\r\nloose pearls. Many of these appear in the portraits of this popular\r\nqueen; but probably the most remarkable exhibition of them is in the\r\nportrait now owned by the Earl of Leven and Melville,[492] which appears\r\nto agree fairly well with the inventories of her jewels, although this\r\nportrait is not wholly free from impeachment as to its accuracy and\r\ncontemporaneousness.\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of the queen, most of her jewels were sold, pawned,\r\nor lost by theft. A number of them passed into the possession of Queen\r\nElizabeth in 1568, in a manner not wholly satisfactory to lovers of\r\njustice. Some of these were described in a letter dated May 8, 1568, and\r\naddressed to Catharine de’ Medici by Bodutel de la Forest, the French\r\nambassador at the English court, as “six cordons of large pearls, strung\r\nas paternosters; but there are about twenty-five separate from the\r\nothers much larger and more beautiful than those which are strung. They\r\nwere first shown to three or four jewelers and lapidaries of this city,\r\nwho estimated them at three thousand pounds sterling, and who offered to\r\ngive that sum; certain Italian merchants who viewed them afterwards\r\nvalued them at 12,000 _escus_, which is the price, as I am told, this\r\nqueen [Elizabeth] will take them at. There is a Genevese who saw them\r\nafter the others and estimated them as worth 16,000 _escus_\r\n[$24,000].”[493]\r\n\r\nCatharine de’ Medici, who was a mother-in-law of Mary Stuart, was very\r\nanxious to obtain these pearls; but the ambassador wrote on May 15,\r\n1568, that he had found it impossible to purchase them; for, as he had\r\ntold her from the first, they were intended for the gratification of the\r\nQueen of England, who had purchased them at her own price, and was even\r\nthen in possession of them.[494]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEEN ELIZABETH’S PEARLS. Although in her youth she is said to have had\r\na distaste for personal decorations, in her later years Queen Elizabeth\r\nentertained an extravagant fondness for pearls. In speaking of her\r\nportraits, Horace Walpole says: “A pale Roman nose, a head of hair\r\nloaded with crowns and powdered with diamonds, a vast ruff, a vaster\r\nfardingale, and a bushel of pearls, are features by which everybody\r\nknows at once the pictures of Queen Elizabeth.”[495] And to the end, her\r\nlove for them was unabated, for in the last tragi-comic scene of her\r\nlife, to meet the Angel of Death himself, she was dressed up in her most\r\nsplendid jewels with great pearl necklaces and earrings and pendants, as\r\nPaul Delaroche so successfully pictured in his remarkable painting in\r\nthe Louvre.\r\n\r\nThe faded waxwork effigy of her, long preserved in Westminster Abbey in\r\nthat curious collection of effigies[496]—the “Ragged Regiment,” as\r\nWalpole called them—has a coronet of large spherical pearls in wax, long\r\nnecklaces of them, a great pearl-ornamented stomacher, pearl earrings\r\nwith large pear-shaped pendants, and even broad, pearl medallions on the\r\nshoe-bows. In accordance with that singular custom which prevailed from\r\nthe time of Henry V (1422), to that of Queen Anne (1714),[497] this\r\neffigy lay on her coffin at the funeral and caused, says Stow in his\r\nChronicle, “such a general sighing, groning, and weeping, as the like\r\nhath not beene seene or knowne in the memory of man.” A contemporaneous\r\npoet wrote that when the corpse with the effigy passed down the Thames\r\nto lie in state at Whitehall,\r\n\r\n                Fish wept their eyes of pearl quite out,\r\n                And swam blind after.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRESHAM PEARL. During the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Sir Thomas Gresham,\r\nthe merchant prince, was credited with possessing a pearl valued at\r\n£15,000, which he reduced to powder and drank in a glass of wine to the\r\nhealth of the queen, in order to astonish the Spanish ambassador, with\r\nwhom he had laid a wager that he would give a more costly dinner than\r\ncould the Spaniards.[498] No other information regarding this pearl\r\nseems available. The valuation certainly appears excessive when compared\r\nwith that of some other pearls of that period.\r\n\r\nWe quote an item from Burgon,[499] taken from the manuscript journal\r\nkept by Edward VI:\r\n\r\n  25 [April, 1551]. A bargaine made with the Fulcare for about 60,000\r\n  l. that in May and August should be paid, for the deferring of it.\r\n  First, that the Foulcare should put it off for ten in the hundred.\r\n  Secondly, that I should buy 12,000 marks weight at 6 shilinges the\r\n  ounce to be delivered at Antwerpe, and so conveyed over. Thirdly, I\r\n  should pay 100,000 crowns for a very faire juel of his, four rubies\r\n  marvelous big, one orient and great diamount, and one great pearle.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUDOLPH II PEARLS. The scientific, art-loving, but eccentric Rudolph II\r\n(1552–1612), Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, gathered about him at\r\nPrague a great collection of jewels and wealth of all sorts. The values\r\nof his pearls and precious stones, of the gold and silver articles, was\r\nestimated by the archæologist, Jules Cæsar Boulenger, at seventeen\r\nmillions of gold florins, which was a very considerable sum at that\r\ntime, as appears when we consider that one hundred gold florins annually\r\nwas deemed a good salary for an official at the emperor’s court. De Boot\r\nmentions a pearl belonging to Rudolph II which weighed “thirty carats\r\nand cost as many thousands of gold pieces.” It is quite likely that this\r\nwas the one noted by Gomara as coming from the Gulf of Panama,[500] and\r\nwhich Rudolph probably inherited from his grandfather, Emperor Charles\r\nV. The pearl bought by Oviedo in Panama, prior to 1526, may be one of\r\nthe principal decorations of the imperial crown of Austria.\r\n\r\nWe read in that curious and interesting book, “The Generall Historie of\r\nthe Turkes,” by Richard Knolles,[501] that Abbas the Great, Shah of\r\nPersia (1557–1628), after having defeated the Turks in many battles,\r\ndesired to form an alliance with Emperor Rudolph II, and to induce him\r\nto break his engagements with the Turks. To this end Shah Abbas, in 1610\r\nsent an embassy to Prague, with many valuable gifts for the emperor,\r\namong which were “three orientall pearles exceeding big.” It has been\r\nconjectured, and it is also claimed, that these may be three of the\r\neight pear-shaped pearls which are now to be seen in the crown of\r\nRudolph II. One of the largest pearls in the Austrian crown, as we have\r\nstated, is most probably the Oviedo pearl.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES I PEARL. Admirers of Vandyke’s pictures of Charles I (1600–1649)\r\nreadily recall the pearl pendant from his right ear, which appears in\r\nnearly all of his portraits by that artist. Janin wrote: “This pearl in\r\nthe ear of his majesty was greatly coveted, and as soon as his head had\r\nfallen, the witnesses of the dreadful scene rushed forward, ready to\r\nimbue their hands in his blood in order to secure the royal jewel.” It\r\nseems more probable that the martyr king would have left this gem in the\r\nhands of a trusty friend for his family than to the risk of injury by\r\nthe ax and to be torn from his mutilated head by a scrambling mob.\r\n\r\n\r\nOWING to their control of the great fisheries, the most valuable\r\ncollections of pearls have been held by eastern monarchs, and\r\nparticularly by those of India and Persia. It has been estimated that\r\none third of the portable wealth of these countries is in jewels. Most\r\nOrientals are as suspicious of interest in their jewels as they are of\r\ninquiry regarding their harems, imagining, doubtless, that the interest\r\nconceals a sentiment of cupidity, hence it is not practicable to give a\r\nminute description of them. However, several travelers have recorded\r\nglowing accounts of collections which they have examined, which read\r\nmuch like a description of Aladdin’s palace in the Arabian Nights. Among\r\nthese, some of the greatest are the\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARLS DESCRIBED BY TAVERNIER. For accounts of remarkable pearls in\r\neastern countries in the seventeenth century, we are indebted to that\r\nwell-informed old French jeweler, Tavernier, one of the most remarkable\r\ngem dealers the world has ever known. He made numerous journeys to\r\nPersia, Turkey, Central Asia, and the East Indies, gaining the\r\nconfidence of the highest officials and trading in gems of the greatest\r\nvalue. After amassing a large fortune and purchasing a barony near Lake\r\nGeneva, he died at Moscow in 1689 while on a mercantile trip to the\r\nOrient, at the age of eighty-four years. His “Voyages,” published in\r\n1676–1679, reveal a critical knowledge of gems, a remarkable insight\r\ninto human nature, and the absence of any intention to impart misleading\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nIn the first English edition of his travels, published in 1678,\r\nTavernier gave sketches of five of the principal pearls which came under\r\nhis careful observation.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 of Tavernier’s diagram shows what he considered “the largest\r\nand most perfect pearl ever discovered, and without the least defect.”\r\nThe weight of this pear-shaped gem does not appear to have been noted,\r\nbut from the sketch it may be estimated at about 500 grains. Tavernier\r\nstates that the bloodthirsty Shah Sofi, King of Persia, purchased it in\r\n1633 from an Arab who had just received it from the fisheries at El\r\nKatif. “It cost him 32,000 tomans, or 1,400,000 livres of our money, at\r\nthe rate of 46 livres and 6 deniers per toman ($552,000).”[502]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH OF ENGLAND\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ELIZABETH OF FRANCE\r\n]\r\n\r\nVery much smaller but more beautiful than this great pearl, was the one\r\nwhich Tavernier saw in 1670 at Ormus in the possession of the Imam of\r\nMuscat, who had recently recovered the Muscat peninsula from the\r\nPortuguese. The jeweler stated that although this weighed only twelve\r\nand one sixteenth carats (forty-eight and a quarter grains),[503] and\r\nwas not perfectly round, it surpassed in beauty all others in the world\r\nat that time. It was so clear and lustrous as to appear translucent. At\r\nthe conclusion of a grand entertainment given by the Khan of Ormus, at\r\nwhich Tavernier was present, the Prince of Muscat drew this gem from a\r\nsmall purse suspended about his neck, and exhibited it to the company.\r\nThe Khan of Ormus offered 2000 tomans (about $34,500) for it, but the\r\nowner would not part with his treasure. Tavernier states that later the\r\nprince refused an offer of 40,000 _escus_ ($45,000) from Aurangzeb, the\r\nGreat Mogul of India.[504]\r\n\r\nFigure 3 in the diagram represents a pear-shaped pearl of fifty-five\r\ncarats (220 grains) which Tavernier sold to Shaista Khan, uncle of the\r\nGrand Mogul. Although of large size and good shape, this was deficient\r\nin luster. According to the jeweler, this pearl was from the Island of\r\nMargarita on the Venezuelan coast, and was the largest ever carried from\r\nOccident to Orient.\r\n\r\nTavernier listed among the Great Mogul’s jewels a large olive-shaped\r\npearl, perfect in form and luster. The weight was not noted, but from\r\nthe sketch which he gave (see Fig. 4) it may be estimated at about 125\r\ngrains. It formed the central ornament of a chain of emeralds and\r\nrubies, which the Mogul sometimes wore about his neck. He also listed a\r\nround pearl of perfect form (see Fig. 5). The weight of this also is not\r\nnoted, but from the sketch it may be estimated at 110 grains. This was\r\nthe largest perfectly spherical pearl known to Tavernier. Its equal had\r\nnever been found, and for that reason it was kept with the unmounted\r\njewels.\r\n\r\nAmong the other pearl treasures of the Great Mogul, Tavernier noted the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n(a) Two grand, pear-shaped pearls, one weighing about seventy\r\nratis,[505] a little flattened on both sides, and of beautiful water and\r\ngood form. (b) A button-shaped pearl, weighing from fifty-five to sixty\r\nratis, of good form and good water. (c) A round pearl of great\r\nperfection, a little flat on one side and weighing fifty-six ratis; this\r\nhad been presented to the Great Mogul by Shah Abbas II, King of Persia.\r\n(d) Three round yellowish pearls weighing from twenty-five to\r\ntwenty-eight ratis each. (e) A perfectly round pearl, thirty-five and a\r\nhalf ratis, white and perfect in all respects. This was the only jewel\r\npurchased by the Great Mogul himself, the others being inherited or\r\ncoming to him as presents. (f) Two pearls perfectly shaped and equal,\r\neach weighing twenty-five and a quarter ratis. (g) Also two chains, one\r\nof pearls and rubies of different shapes pierced like the pearls; the\r\nother of pearls and emeralds, round and bored. All of these pearls were\r\nround and ranged in weight from ten to twelve ratis each.[506]\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACOCK THRONE. The famous Takht-i-Tâ’ûs, or “Peacock Throne,” at Delhi\r\ndoubtless contained the greatest accumulation of gems in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. It was completed, in the eighth year of his reign (1044 A.H.,\r\n1634 A.D.) by Shah Jehan, greatest of Mogul sovereigns, who likewise\r\nbuilt the Taj Mahal at Agra, one of the most beautiful edifices ever\r\ndesigned by man. Abd-al-Hamid, of Lahore, in his Pâd-shâh-nâmah, “Book\r\nof the King,” composed prior to 1654, writes as follows:[507]\r\n\r\n  In the course of years many valuable gems had come into the imperial\r\n  jewel house, each one of which might serve as an ear-drop for Venus\r\n  or as an adornment for the girdle of the Sun. Upon the accession of\r\n  the emperor, it occurred to him that, in the opinion of far-seeing\r\n  men the acquisition of such rare jewels and the keeping of such\r\n  wonderful brilliants could render but one service, that of adorning\r\n  the throne of the empire. They ought, therefore, to be put to such a\r\n  use that beholders might benefit by their splendour and that majesty\r\n  might shine with increased brilliancy.\r\n\r\nAs described by Tavernier in 1676, great quantities of pearls were used\r\nin the ornamentation of this throne, the arched roof, the supporting\r\npillars, the adjacent sun-umbrellas, being well covered with these gems,\r\nmany of them of great value. The choicest one was pear-shaped, yellowish\r\nin color, and weighed about fifty carats (200 grains);[508] this was\r\nsuspended from a great ruby which ornamented the breast of the peacock.\r\n“But that which in my opinion is the most costly thing about this\r\nmagnificent throne is that the twelve columns supporting the canopy are\r\nsurrounded with beautiful rows of pearls, which are round and of fine\r\nwater, and weigh from 6 to 10 carats each [24 to 40 grains].”[509] The\r\ntotal value of the jewels entering into the ornamentation was estimated\r\nat 160,500,000 livres or $60,187,500; and the present value of the\r\nthrone as it stands in the shah’s palace at Teheran, whither it was\r\ncarried by Nadir Shah from the sack of Delhi in 1739, even though\r\ndivested of many of its most valuable gems, is estimated at\r\n$13,000,000.[510] The designer of the Peacock Throne was Austin de\r\nBordeaux, who also planned the magnificent Taj Mahal. He was named by\r\nShah Jehan, “Jewel-Handed,” and received a salary of two thousand rupees\r\na month.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAH’S “TIPPET.” Sir Harford Jones Brydges’ description of the jewels of\r\nthe Shah of Persia at Teheran is of particular value, since he had\r\nformerly dealt in jewels and was an expert in such matters. He says:\r\n\r\n  I was particularly struck with the king’s tippet, a covering for\r\n  part of his back, his shoulders and his arms, which is only used on\r\n  the very highest occasions. It is a piece of pearl work of the most\r\n  beautiful pattern; the pearls are worked on velvet, but they stand\r\n  so close together that little, if any, of the velvet is visible. It\r\n  took me a good hour to examine this single article, which I have no\r\n  fear of saying can not be matched in the world. There was not a\r\n  single pearl employed in forming this most gorgeous trapping less in\r\n  size than the largest marrow-fat pea I ever saw raised in England,\r\n  and many—I should suppose from 150 to 200—the size of a wild plum,\r\n  and throughout the whole of these pearls, it would puzzle the best\r\n  jeweler who should examine them most critically to discover in more\r\n  than 4 or 5 a serious fault. The tassel is formed of pearls of the\r\n  most uncommon size and beauty; and the emerald which forms the top\r\n  of the tassel is perhaps the largest perfect one in the world....\r\n  For some days after I had seen these jewels, I attempted to make an\r\n  estimate of their value, but I got so confused in the recollection\r\n  of their weight and the allowance to be made in some of them for\r\n  their perfection in water and color, that I gave it up as\r\n  impossible. I cannot, however, think I shall much mislead if I say\r\n  that on a moderate, perhaps a low calculation, their value cannot be\r\n  less than fifteen millions [sterling?] of our money.[511]\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAH’S PEARLS IN 1820. Nearly a century ago the elaborate state costume\r\nof the Shah of Persia was described by the English artist, Sir Robert\r\nKer Porter. In this description he mentioned particularly the pearls in\r\nthe tiara, the pear-shaped pearls of immense size with which the plumes\r\nwere tipped, the two strings of pearls—“probably the largest in the\r\nworld”—which crossed the king’s shoulders, and the large cushion incased\r\nin a network of beautiful pearls against which he reclined.[512]\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARLS OF THE GAIKWAR OF BARODA. Among the greatest jeweled treasures of\r\nIndia are those of the present Mahratta Gaikwar of Baroda, who has\r\nprecedence over all the rulers in India at all functions, and is one of\r\nthe most prominent and enlightened of the Indian princes. He governs a\r\nprovince of about 8225 square miles and 2,415,396 inhabitants in the\r\nnorthwestern part of India, 248 miles north of Bombay. Most of these\r\ntreasures, whose value is estimated at a dozen million dollars, were\r\ncollected by his predecessor, Mahratta Khandarao, who lived in barbaric\r\nsplendor, and they are rarely worn by the present gaikwar. These\r\ntreasures include a sash of one hundred rows of pearls, terminating in a\r\ngreat tassel of pearls and emeralds; seven rows of superb pearls whose\r\nvalue is estimated at half a million dollars; a litter set with\r\nseed-pearls, quantities of unstrung pearls, and more remarkable yet, a\r\nshawl or carpet of pearls, which closely resembles the “tippet” at\r\nTeheran described by Brydge. This carpet is said to be ten and one half\r\nfeet long by six feet wide, and to be made up of strings of pearls,\r\nexcept that a border, eleven inches wide, and also center ornaments, are\r\nworked out in diamonds. Some writers assert that this costly ornament\r\nwas originally intended by the late Mahratta Khandarao as a covering for\r\nthe tomb of Mohammed. Others state that it was designed as a present for\r\na woman of whom he was enamoured, but that the British resident\r\ninterfered, claiming that the wealth of Baroda was not sufficient to\r\nwarrant such an expensive gift on the part of the ruler. This ornament\r\nis now retained among the regalia at Baroda, and is probably the most\r\ncostly pearl ornament in the world, its value being estimated at several\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMER PALACE IN 1860. Many superb pearls were among the precious\r\nobjects in the Yuen-Min-Yuen or Summer Palace in Pekin at the time of\r\nits capture by the European forces in 1860. Numbers of these were lost\r\nin the confusion of the sacking and plunder, when the soldiers’ pockets\r\nwere filled and the floors were strewn with jewels, beautiful objects of\r\ngold and silver, rich silks and furs, carved jade, lapis lazuli, etc.\r\nSome of the pearls found their way to Europe, and especially to France\r\nand England. They were of good size and luster and were mostly yellowish\r\nin color. Unfortunately, many were crudely drilled with large holes, and\r\nhad been strung on gold wires by which they were attached to the idols\r\nthey decorated at the time they were stolen. More than one hundred, each\r\nover thirty grains in weight, were received in England, and sold at an\r\naverage of nearly one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PEARL CARPET OR SHAWL OF THE GAIKWAR OF BARODA\r\n]\r\n\r\nA similar booty came from the spoliation during the war between China\r\nand Japan in 1894, and during the Boxer outbreaks of 1901, and\r\nquantities of pearls, often large and of fine color, but a little the\r\nworse for wear, were brought to the United States and Europe by the\r\nsoldiers and officials, and also by traders and travelers who obtained\r\nthem in China. The pendant figured is one of these objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOGIBUS PEARL. This famous pearl, said to have been the largest in\r\nEurope, weighed no less than 126 carats (504 grains). It was pear-shaped\r\nand of fine orient, and was brought from the West Indies, in 1620, by\r\nFrançois Gogibus, a native of Calais, who sold it to Philip IV of Spain.\r\nAs no match could be found for this magnificent gem, it was mounted as a\r\nbutton in the royal cap.[513]\r\n\r\n\r\nLA REINE DES PERLES. The large round pearl of the French crown jewels\r\nwhich is listed in the inventory of 1791 at 200,000 francs, was\r\npurchased in 1669[514] for the sum of 40,000 livres, from a gem dealer\r\nnamed Bazu, who had traveled in the East at about the time of\r\nTavernier’s voyage. In the inventory of 1691, it is described as “a\r\nvirgin pearl, perfect, round, and of fine water,” weighing 27½ carats\r\nand valued at 90,000 livres. When the greater part of the jewels were\r\nstolen from the Garde-Meuble in 1792, we are told that the thieves took\r\na pearl inclosed in a gold box on which was written: “The queen of\r\npearls.” This was most probably the one we have described and there is\r\nreason to believe that this same pearl came later into the possession of\r\nthe Zozima brothers, and was called La Pellegrina.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA RÉGENTE. This name was bestowed upon a big, ovate pearl which was in\r\nthe collection of the French crown jewels. This pearl, which weighs 337\r\ngrains, was furnished in November, 1811, by the court jewelers, Messrs.\r\nNoitat, for a tiara, worn by Marie Louise, Empress of France. By order\r\nof the emperor, Napoleon III, the pearl was taken out of the tiara and\r\nmounted, in August, 1853, by the Paris jeweler Lemounier into a brooch.\r\nThis great brooch, with “La Régente” as the central gem, was bought by\r\nFaberge & Company of St. Petersburg, Russia, for the Princess\r\nYoussoupoff at the “Vente des Diamants de la Couronne” in 1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA PELLEGRINA. For nearly a century there has been in Russia one of the\r\nmost lovely pearls in the world; this is La Pellegrina, formerly owned\r\nby the Zozima brothers of Moscow, who were antiquarians of note in St.\r\nPetersburg. In 1818 a small book of forty-eight pages was written about\r\nthis beautiful gem by G. Fischer de Waldheim, vice-president of the\r\nImperial Medico-Chirurgical Academy, probably the only book ever devoted\r\nto a single pearl. According to this writer, La Pellegrina was purchased\r\nat Leghorn by one of the Zozima brothers from an English admiral who had\r\njust returned from India. It combines all the requisites of perfection:\r\nit is absolutely spherical and has never been pierced; its luster, its\r\nsilvery sheen, make it appear almost transparent, and for a pearl of\r\nthis high grade, it is of remarkable size, weighing 111½ grains.\r\n\r\nThe Zozima brothers retained it in a sea-urchin shell mounted in gold\r\nand with a convex lens as cover; this was contained in a silver box, and\r\nthis in turn in another box studded with gems. Although the lens\r\nenlarged the appearance of the pearl, it detracted from its beautiful\r\nform, giving it an oval shape. But when removed from the triple\r\ninclosure, it rolled about like a globule of quicksilver, and surpassed\r\nthat metal in whiteness and brilliancy.\r\n\r\n  Everything that is beautiful and perfect takes such possession of\r\n  the beholder that words become insufficient to express his feelings;\r\n  and that is what happened to me in the case of La Pellegrina of\r\n  Zozima. One must have seen an object of this kind in order to\r\n  appreciate the impression it makes. As an evidence of this, I shall\r\n  note the last visit which I made to the owner in company with\r\n  several distinguished persons.\r\n\r\n  After having examined many curious medals and coins, and also some\r\n  pearls which exceeded in size the one of which I treat, and after\r\n  they had received their due meed of admiration, La Pellegrina\r\n  appeared, rolled upon a sheet of paper by the owner’s little finger.\r\n  Attention and admiration was depicted on every face; a perfect\r\n  silence reigned. It was only when the pearl had been removed very\r\n  carefully lest it should slip away, and was again triply enclosed,\r\n  that we recovered the power of speech and could unanimously express\r\n  our admiration.[515]\r\n\r\nAs it had been stated that this pearl was in the possession of the\r\nPrincess Youssoupoff, Mr. Henry W. Hiller of New York, who was in St.\r\nPetersburg, courteously made inquiries and was successful in obtaining a\r\nview of the two splendid pear-shaped pearls. These are almost exactly\r\nalike, but neither of them can well be La Pellegrina, since this is a\r\nround pearl; possibly the one on the right may be La Peregrina.[516]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE HOPE PEARL. WEIGHS 1800 GRAINS\r\n\r\n  Actual size\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe owner of La Pellegrina in 1818, Z. P. Zozima, died in Moscow at a\r\ngreat age, in 1827. He was a Greek dealer in curiosities and gems, who\r\nhad resided in Moscow for a long time, and had many clients among the\r\nnobility of Russia. It is stated that a few months before his death the\r\nbest pieces of his collection, including La Pellegrina, were stolen from\r\nhim by a compatriot.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSCOW PEARL, 1840. The German traveler, Johann Georg Kohl (1808–1878),\r\nin the account of his travels in Russia, relates an interesting incident\r\nconnected with a beautiful pearl in the Imperial Treasury. Shortly\r\nprevious to 1840, a rich Moscow merchant died in a convent, whither he\r\nhad retreated after the manner of the wealthy pious ones of his nation.\r\nFeeling the approach of age, he had given up the toils of business to\r\nhis sons. His wife was dead, and the only beloved object which even in\r\nthe cloister was not separated from him was a large, beautiful, oriental\r\npearl. This precious object had been purchased for him by some Persian\r\nor Arabian friend at a high price, and, enchanted by its water,\r\nmagnificent size, and color, its perfect shape and luster, he would\r\nnever part with it, however enormous the sum offered. He himself\r\ninhabited an ordinary cell in the convent; but this object of his love\r\nreposed on silk in a golden casket. It was shown to few persons, and\r\nfavorable circumstances and strong recommendations were necessary to\r\nobtain such a favor. A Moscow resident reported the style and manner of\r\nthe ceremony. On the appointed day he went with his friends to the\r\nconvent, and found the old gentleman awaiting his guests in his holiday\r\nclothes. Their reception had something of solemnity about it. The old\r\nman went into his cell and brought out the casket in its rich covering.\r\nHe spread white satin on the table, and, unlocking the casket, let the\r\nprecious pearl roll out before the enchanted eyes of the spectators. No\r\none ventured to touch it, but all burst into acclamations, and the old\r\nman’s eyes gleamed like his pearl. After a short time it was returned to\r\nthe casket. During his last illness, the old gentleman never let the\r\npearl out of his hand, and after his death it was with difficulty taken\r\nfrom his stiffened fingers.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a great similarity between the description of this\r\npearl and that of La Pellegrina, although we have been unable to verify\r\nour surmise as to their identity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOPE PEARL. In the first half of the last century, Henry Philip\r\nHope, a London banker, brought together a great collection of gems,\r\namong which were many pearls. The most famous of these was the\r\noften-described Hope pearl, one of the largest known; the value of\r\nwhich, however, is not in proportion to its size, owing to its irregular\r\nformation. As described in the catalogue of the Hope collection,\r\npublished in 1839, this oriental pearl is of an irregular pear-shape,\r\nweighs 1800 grains, or three ounces, measures two inches in length, and\r\nin circumference four and one half inches at the broadest and three and\r\none fourth inches at the narrowest end. The color at the larger end is\r\nof a bronze or a dark green copper tint, this gradually clearing into a\r\nfine white luster for within one and one half inches of the smaller end.\r\nThis baroque pearl was firmly attached to the shell, and it yet shows\r\nthe point of attachment, which has been polished so as to correspond to\r\nthe remaining portion. It is attractively mounted, the smaller end being\r\ncapped with an arched crown of red enameled gold set with diamonds,\r\nrubies, and emeralds.[517] After remaining in the Hope jewel collection\r\nat the South Kensington Museum for many years, it was sold at auction,\r\nat Christie’s, in 1886, when that collection was placed on the market.\r\nThis pearl is now held by Messrs. Garrard & Company of London, at the\r\nprice of £9000.\r\n\r\nThe Hope collection also contained about 148 pearls of good form.\r\nNotable among these were the following: (a) a conical pearl weighing\r\n151 grains, cream-white in color, from Polynesia; (b) a bouton pearl\r\nof 124 grains, bluish-white at the top and encircled by a dark bronze\r\ncolor; (c) an oval cream-colored pearl, weighing ninety-four grains,\r\nfrom the South Seas; (d) an eighty-nine-grain, roughly spherical\r\npearl, one side bluish and the other of a light bronze; (e) an\r\neighty-five-grain, acorn-shaped, bluish-white pearl, with a band of\r\nopaque white near the base; (f) an oval conch pearl, pink in general\r\ncolor and somewhat whitish at the ends, weighing eighty-two and one\r\nfourth grains; (g) another conch pearl, seventy-seven and one half\r\ngrains, button-shaped, yellowish white with a slight shade of pink;\r\n(h) a seventy-six-and-one-half-grain drop-shaped pearl of a\r\n_chatoyant_ aspect, of white color shaded with red, purple, and green;\r\nand (i) a pear-shaped Scottish pearl of thirty-four and three fourths\r\ngrains, of a milky bluish caste, slightly tinged with pink.\r\n\r\n\r\nVAN BUREN PEARLS. Among the collections of the United States National\r\nMuseum are two pendant pearls each weighing about thirty grains, and a\r\nnecklace containing 148 pearls with an aggregate weight of 700 grains.\r\nThese were presented in 1840 to President Van Buren by the Imam of\r\nMuscat. They were deposited in the vaults of the Treasury Department,\r\nwhere they remained until a few years ago, when, by the order of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, they were transferred to the custody of the\r\nNational Museum where they now are.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HER GRACE, THE DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIERS NECKLACE. In the galleries of the Louvre at Paris may be seen a\r\npearl necklace formerly owned by the wife of President Thiers\r\n(1797–1887), consisting of 145 pearls in three rows. The weights of the\r\nthree largest individual pearls are fifty-one, thirty-nine, and\r\nthirty-six grains, respectively. The aggregate weight is 2079 grains,\r\nand the value at the time of their deposit was estimated at 300,000\r\nfrancs. This is on a base of $2.02; at a higher valuation the figures\r\nwould be:\r\n\r\n                 $148,947 = $71.64 per grain; base, $5\r\n                  238,315 = 114.63 per grain; base,  8\r\n\r\nthe last being very probably nearer to the correct value of the necklace\r\nat the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIFFANY QUEEN PEARL. Doubtless the most famous pearl ever found within\r\nthe limits of the United States, and likewise one of the choicest, is\r\nthe well-known “Queen Pearl,” found in Notch Brook near Paterson, New\r\nJersey, in 1857.[518] In form it is a perfect sphere, and weighs\r\nninety-three grains. The history of the discovery and of the sale of\r\nthis beautiful gem is set forth on page 260.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAPST PEARLS. Very practical is the account given by Streeter of a\r\npair of magnificent spherical pearls exhibited at the Paris Exhibition\r\nin 1878 by Messrs. Bapst of Paris. One of these pearls—then weighing 116\r\ngrains—was purchased by Mr. Streeter in 1877, and by him sold to a\r\nleading merchant of London, who skilfully removed a blemish on it,\r\nreducing it to 113¾ grains in weight. After holding it for some months,\r\nit occurred to him that it would match a pearl sold by Hunt and Roskell\r\nto Dhuleep Singh about fifteen years previously. On comparison, the two\r\nwere found to match perfectly, one weighing 113¾ and the other 113¼\r\ngrains. The two were eventually sold early in 1878 “for £4800, which was\r\neven then much below their value, and to-day they would be worth\r\n£10,000. They were exhibited in the great Paris Exposition in 1878,\r\nwhere they attracted universal attention, and were pronounced by\r\nconnoisseurs to be the most extraordinary pair of pearls ever seen in\r\nEurope. They were sold from the exhibition to an individual for a very\r\nlarge sum.”[519]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “SOUTHERN CROSS.” The “Southern Cross” is an unusual pearl or rather\r\ncluster of pearls which attracted much attention twenty years ago. It\r\nconsists of nine attached pearls forming a Roman cross about one and one\r\nhalf inches in length, seven pearls constituting the shaft or standard,\r\nwhile the arms are formed by one pearl on each side of the second one\r\nfrom the upper end. The luster is good, but the individual pearls are\r\nnot perfect spheres, being mutually compressed at the point of juncture\r\nand considerably flattened at the back. If separated, the aggregate\r\nvalue of the individual pearls would be small, and the celebrity of the\r\nornament is due almost exclusively to its form. This striking formation\r\nwas exhibited at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition at London in 1886,\r\nand later at the Paris Exhibition in 1889, where it was the center of\r\ninterest, and obtained a gold medal for the exhibitors. It is reported\r\nthat an effort was made to bring about its sale at £10,000, the owners\r\nsuggesting that it was especially appropriate for presentation to Leo\r\nXIII, on the occasion of his jubilee in 1896. The writers have been\r\nunable to obtain information as to its present location.\r\n\r\nMuch information relative to the “Southern Cross” was volunteered by\r\nHenry Taunton in the very interesting account of his wanderings in\r\nAustralia. He presents apparently reliable statements showing that it\r\nwas found on March 26, 1883, off Baldwin Creek in Lat. 17° S. and Long.\r\n122° E., by a boy named Clark, in the employ of James W. S. Kelly, a\r\nmaster pearler. When delivered to Kelly, it was in three distinct\r\npieces, but the boy reported that it was in one piece when he found it a\r\nfew hours before. Kelly sold it in the three pieces in which he received\r\nit for £10 to a fellow pearler named Roy; Roy sold it for £40 to a man\r\nnamed Craig, and he sold it to an Australian syndicate.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to Taunton’s positive statement, there were only\r\neight pearls in the cluster when it was sold by Kelly in 1883, and to\r\nmake it resemble a well-proportioned cross—the right arm being\r\nabsent—another pearl of suitable size and shape was subsequently secured\r\nat Cossack and attached in the proper place to the others, which, in the\r\nmeantime, had been refastened together by diamond cement, thus making\r\nthree artificial joints in the present cluster. “As if to assist in the\r\ndeception, nature had fashioned a hollow in the side of the central\r\npearl just where the added pearl would have to be fitted; and—the whole\r\npearling fleet with their pearls and shells coming into Cossack about\r\nthis time—it was no difficult matter to select a pearl of the right size\r\nand with the convexity required. The holder paid some ten or twelve\r\npounds for the option of selecting a pearl within given limits; and then\r\nonce more, with the aid of diamond cement and that of a skilful ‘faker,’\r\nthis celebrated gem was transformed into a perfect cross.”[520]\r\n\r\n\r\nMORGAN-TIFFANY COLLECTION. Probably the most interesting assortment of\r\nAmerican pearls is the Morgan-Tiffany Collection in the American Museum\r\nof Natural History, New York. The excellence of this collection lies,\r\nnot in the high cost of any individual pearl, but in its illustrating in\r\na comprehensive manner the great variety, colors, and forms of American\r\npearls. Not only are the many varieties of fresh-water pearls\r\nrepresented, but likewise abalone pearls from the Pacific coast, conch\r\npearls from the Gulf of Mexico, and a good assortment of pearly\r\nconcretions from edible oysters and clams of the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\nThis collection contains 557 species of white and colored Unio pearls,\r\nfour multicolored, five mallet-shapes, 166 baroques, thirty-nine hinge\r\npearls, twenty pearlaceous masses, thirty-four clam (Venus) pearls,\r\nfifteen abalone pearls, eleven conch pearls, and twelve oyster (Ostrea)\r\npearls. The collection was exhibited in two parts, the first at the\r\nParis Exposition of 1889, and the second at the Paris Exposition of\r\n1900. On each occasion a gold medal was awarded.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNT BATTHYANI’S PEARL. A curious history is connected with a beautiful\r\nblack pearl[521] which was at one time in the possession of Count Louis\r\nBatthyani, the premier of the revolutionary government of Hungary. The\r\ncount was shot in 1849, by the orders of a court-martial, and on the eve\r\nof his execution he gave the pearl, which he had worn mounted on a\r\nscarf-pin, to his trusty and faithful valet. The latter left it to his\r\nson, who, when in straightened circumstances, sought to raise money upon\r\nthe pearl. The pawnbroker of the small town was distrustful of its value\r\nand took it to Budapest for appraisal. There the suspicions of the\r\nauthorities were aroused, an investigation was ordered, and it was\r\nfinally discovered that the pearl had been stolen one hundred and fifty\r\nyears before from the English crown. The English government redeemed it\r\nfor the sum of £2500 ($12,500). How it came into the possession of Count\r\nBatthyani is a mystery; probably he purchased it from some antiquarian.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 there was shown in Paris one of the most important black pearls\r\nof any time, a pear-shaped pearl of forty-nine grains, of a most\r\nwonderful black color with a green sheen, as perfectly formed as though\r\nit had been turned out of a lathe; it did not terminate in a point at\r\nthe small end, but was slightly flattened. It was so beautiful an object\r\nthat it almost seemed it should never be drilled for mounting. This\r\npearl ultimately sold for more than $30,000, and it is probably the\r\nfinest black pearl that has ever reached the European markets.\r\n\r\nAccording to a personal communication from E. Z. Steever, governor of\r\nthe District of Sulu, the largest pearl that he has seen in the islands\r\nbelongs to the sultan, and is now in the possession of Hadji Butu,\r\nformer prime minister. It is an oblate spheroid, there being a trifling\r\ndifference between the two diameters. The upper hemisphere is very\r\nbeautiful; the lower one has a few minute, black specks which are\r\nsuperficial and could be easily removed, the pearl not having been\r\ntreated since it was taken from the oyster. This pearl measures five\r\neighths of an inch at its greatest diameter and is said to weigh twelve\r\ncarats (forty-eight grains). Hadji Butu informed Governor Steever that\r\nthe sultan had refused $25,000 for the pearl in Singapore.\r\n\r\nThe Nordica pearl is the finest abalone of which we have any record. It\r\nweighs 175 grains, is a drop pearl of a greenish hue, with brilliant red\r\nfire-like flashes, and serves as a pendant to the famous collection of\r\ncolored pearls belonging to the beloved and admired American prima\r\ndonna, Madam Nordica.\r\n\r\nAt the International Exposition in Paris in 1889, Mr. Alphonse Falco,\r\npresident of the Chambre Syndicale, exhibited a round pearl, white and\r\nlustrous, weighing seventy grains, and valued at 50,000 francs.\r\n\r\nAugusto Castellani, the well-known Italian jeweler of Rome, in the year\r\n1868, during the Papal regime, executed a crown for King Victor Emmanuel\r\nII. This crown was destined for the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, in\r\nJerusalem, and on it is a pearl which, although slightly irregular, is\r\nas large as the famous Gogibus pearl.\r\n\r\nA remarkable golden-yellow pearl from Shark’s Bay, West Australia, is in\r\nthe possession of a New York lady; it weighs thirty and one half grains,\r\nis perfectly round, and is without a flaw or blemish.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROWN JEWELS OF FRANCE. The collection of gems known as the Crown Jewels\r\nof France owed its origin to Francis I (1494–1547). While in Bordeaux,\r\non his way to meet his bride, Eleanor of Austria, sister of Emperor\r\nCharles V, Francis created by letter patent the Treasure of the Crown\r\nJewels, giving to the state a number of his most valued diamonds, under\r\nthe condition that at each change of sovereign a careful inventory\r\nshould be made. The original collection consisted of six pieces of\r\njewelry valued at 272,242 “_écus soleil_,” or about $700,000. The crown\r\njewels have passed through many vicissitudes in the course of time. A\r\nnumber of the gems were at various times pledged as security for loans\r\nmade in France and Italy, and it is said that in 1588, during the reign\r\nof Henry III, all the jewels disappeared from the royal treasury. Henry\r\nIV strove to regather the scattered ornaments, but it was only in the\r\nreign of Louis XIV that the collection became really important. At the\r\ntime of the French Revolution, in 1791, an inventory was made by the\r\norder of the National Assembly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE MADAM NORDICA COLLECTION OF COLORED PEARLS\r\n\r\n  The Nordica drop pearl weighs 175 grains\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe jewels were then deposited in the Garde-Meuble, where they were\r\nexposed to public view. Either they were very carelessly guarded, or the\r\nguardians were in collusion with a band of thieves, for the room wherein\r\nthey were kept was entered on five successive nights, and when the theft\r\nwas finally discovered only about 500,000 francs’ ($100,000) worth of\r\nthe gems remained. Many of the most valuable objects were, however,\r\ntraced and recovered. Napoleon I, when he became emperor, made every\r\neffort to enrich the treasure, and purchased gems to the value of\r\n6,000,000 francs ($1,200,000), and subsequent rulers added to the\r\ncollection on various occasions.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the official inventory in 1791 the entire collection of\r\npearls was estimated at about 1,000,000 francs ($200,000). The finest\r\nspecimen in the collection was a splendid round pearl weighing 109¼\r\ngrains[522] and estimated at 200,000 francs ($40,000), or $366 per\r\ngrain, on a base of $3.35. Then came two pear-shaped pearls of a fine\r\norient and well-matched, weighing respectively 117¾ and 113 grains, and\r\nvalued at 300,000 francs ($60,000) or $260 per grain, on a base of\r\n$2.25. In addition to the above there were twenty-five separate round\r\npearls which had constituted the necklace of the queen; they ranged in\r\nweight from 36 to 165½ grains, and were valued at about 90,000 francs\r\n($18,000). Beside the pear-shaped pearls to which we have alluded, there\r\nwere two other pairs, each valued at 32,000 francs ($6400) for the two\r\npearls; they averaged about 100 grains in weight. In addition to these\r\nthere were two weighing respectively 175½ and 205¼ grains, each valued\r\nat 20,000 francs ($4000), and seven others ranging in weight from 92½ to\r\n167 grains and valued at from 10,000 to 15,000 francs ($2000 to $3000).\r\nThe best oval pearl was one weighing seventy-six and one half grains and\r\nestimated at 20,000 francs ($4000); there were two others, one of\r\nninety-three grains, valued at 12,000 francs ($2400), and one of 121\r\ngrains, valued at 10,000 francs ($2000). We may also mention an\r\negg-shaped pearl weighing 145¼ grains, estimated as worth 10,000 francs\r\n($2000), and a button pearl of 198 grains entered at 15,000 francs\r\n($3000). Beside these separate pearls there were eleven strings\r\ncomprising 310 pearls, weighing in all 6778 grains and valued at but\r\n29,400 francs (about $6000). The average per pearl was 95 francs ($19),\r\nless than one dollar a grain.\r\n\r\nThese pearls, according to their beauty, would now be worth from four to\r\nsix times the valuation here given, so that the two large pear-shaped\r\npearls of the French crown may be worth to-day $200,000 and the great\r\nround pearl from $100,000 to $250,000.\r\n\r\nMany of these pearls were a century old. They were collected at a time\r\nwhen not as much attention was paid to their absolute perfection and\r\nbeauty as at the present time, for there probably never has been a\r\nperiod when rare and perfect pearls, diamonds, or rubies have been\r\nappreciated so much more highly than those of mediocre quality.\r\n\r\n                             RECAPITULATION\r\n\r\n                         Weight in grains             Value\r\n                 No.     Average       Total  Francs  U.

Worn by the Empress Eugénie\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter the downfall of Napoleon III and the proclamation of the French\r\nRepublic, the jewels were inventoried, and, by a law passed December 10,\r\n1886, it was decreed that a large part of the treasure should be sold at\r\npublic auction. The sale was held in the Pavilion de Flore, a part of\r\nthe Palace of the Tuileries, on May 12, 1887, and, very naturally, all\r\nthe principal gem dealers and collectors were represented. A number of\r\nremarkable pearl ornaments were among the objects offered at this sale,\r\none of the most beautiful being a diadem of an exceptionally artistic\r\nopenwork design, adorned with large, round pearls and surmounted by a\r\nrow of magnificent pear-shaped pearls. The total number of pearls in\r\nthis diadem was 212, and their weight 2452 grains. It was sold for the\r\nsum of 78,000 francs ($15,600). The coronet which accompanied the diadem\r\ncomprised 274 pearls, weighing 984 grains; the design was similar to\r\nthat of the diadem, but the points consisted of a round and a\r\npear-shaped pearl in alternation. This ornament realized the sum of\r\n30,000 francs ($6000). A large brooch of very elaborate and beautiful\r\ndesign, beside a number of smaller pearls, comprised four fine,\r\npear-shaped pendants, weighing 100 grains each, and two choice bouton\r\npearls, and had in the center the famous pearl known as “La Régente,”\r\nwhich was purchased in 1811 for 40,000 francs ($8000). This splendid\r\nornament brought the sum of 176,000 francs ($35,200). Four other\r\nbrooches each contained seven pearls and many brilliants, the\r\ntwenty-eight pearls having a total weight of 1496 grains, an average of\r\nmore than fifty-three grains. Each brooch had two pearls surrounded with\r\nbrilliants, and five large, pear-shaped pearls set as pendants. They\r\nwere sold to different purchasers at prices ranging from 18,500 francs\r\n($3700) to 43,000 francs ($8600), the four together realizing 113,500\r\nfrancs ($22,700).\r\n\r\nSix pearl necklaces were also offered. One of forty-seven pearls\r\nweighing 698 grains was sold for 34,600 francs ($6920), and two others,\r\neach consisting of fifty-eight pearls, with a total weight of 524 and\r\n400 grains respectively, brought the sum of 22,300 francs ($4460) and\r\n15,000 francs ($3000). Another necklace composed of thirty-eight round\r\npearls and nine pear-shaped pendants, the total weight being 1612\r\ngrains, sold for 74,300 francs ($14,860). The two finest necklaces were\r\nbroken up into a number of separate lots. One of them, consisting of 362\r\npearls and weighing in all 5808 grains,—an average of a trifle over\r\nsixteen grains,—was offered in four lots which together brought 295,800\r\nfrancs ($59,160). The other necklace comprised 542 pearls weighing 6752\r\ngrains, and was disposed of in eight lots, realizing in all 331,800\r\nfrancs ($66,360). Two bracelets adorned with 202 pearls and a number of\r\nsmall brilliants were purchased for the sum of 90,200 francs ($18,040).\r\nThe total amount realized for the pearl ornaments was 1,261,500 francs\r\n($252,300).

It is drop-shaped and\r\nbelonged to Rudolph II; it is slightly uneven and the color, although\r\nwhite, is not that of a new pearl, but this pearl has a positive history\r\nof three hundred and six years, and at the present time is probably the\r\noldest known unchanged pearl with a direct and authentic record.\r\n\r\nThe imperial orb is studded with pearls weighing in all 1560 grains.\r\nFour of these weigh forty grains each, the others are of lesser size,\r\nthe smallest weighing ten grains.

He died, however, while making\r\npreparations for his journey to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe imperial vestments used in the coronation ceremonies of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire, were produced in the celebrated Hôtel de Tirâz, at\r\nPalermo. Roger II, King of Sicily (1096–1154), after a victorious\r\ncampaign in Greece, brought back with him to Sicily a number of skilled\r\nsilk-weavers and embroiderers, whom he established at Palermo. The\r\nimperial mantle is of a brilliant purple and bears an inscription,\r\nembroidered in gold and pearls, stating that the garment was made in the\r\nroyal manufactory in the year 1133. Two pearl-embroidered\r\nrepresentations of a lion, who has stricken down a camel and is about to\r\ntear it to pieces, also appear on this mantle. This symbol of royal\r\npower was used frequently by the Saracens, and it is said that Richard\r\nCœur de Lion had this design embroidered on his saddlecloths.[525]\r\n\r\nA fine collection of large baroque pearls is preserved in the Grüne\r\nGewölbe (Green Vaults) in the palace at Dresden, which contains the\r\ntreasures of the royal family of Saxony. Most of these were mounted\r\nduring the eighteenth century by J. M. Dinglinger (1665–1731), the\r\nfamous goldsmith to the Saxon Elector, King Augustus II of Poland, and\r\nwho is sometimes called the German Cellini. A splendid specimen of his\r\nwork is a vase of Egyptian jasper in the shape of a shell, bearing a\r\nrepresentation of Hercules fighting with the Nemæan lion; this bears\r\nreference to the immense personal strength and power of Augustus II,\r\nwhose portrait is painted in enamel on a mirror at the back. The\r\npedestal is adorned with a great many precious stones, pearls, and\r\nenamel paintings in the shape of cameos representing the twelve labors\r\nof Hercules. A dragon is studded with emeralds and its back is formed of\r\npearls, with a large sardonyx in the middle. Hercules and the lion are\r\nin enamel.\r\n\r\nIn the same collection may be seen the figure of a dwarf made by\r\nFerbecq, who was one of the goldsmiths of King Augustus. The body of the\r\ndwarf is formed of a baroque pearl, which is studded with small\r\ndiamonds. His sleeves and trousers are in black and green enamel; his\r\nhat is also of green enamel and on it is a string of diamonds. In his\r\nright hand the dwarf holds a spit and in his left a roast. On his left\r\nshoulder he bears a goose, the upper part of whose body is formed of a\r\npearl; at his right side hangs a bottle also formed of a pearl. The\r\ngilded pedestal is ornamented with white enamel work on a pink ground.\r\nAbove and below, it is set with white and yellow diamonds. Another\r\nfigure, similarly formed of a large baroque pearl ornamented with gold\r\nand diamonds, shows a drunken vintager and his dog; and an exceedingly\r\ngrotesque, ornamented baroque is said to bear a striking resemblance to\r\nSeñor Pepe, the court dwarf of Charles II of Spain.\r\n\r\nExhibited at the Palace of Rosenberg at Copenhagen, are similar designs\r\nin which large baroques form the principal part of fish, birds, dragons,\r\nmermaids, etc. Prominent among them is the figure of a skater, executed\r\nby the jeweler, Diederichsen; it is said that this was made for\r\nFrederick VII, who died before it was accepted, and in 1895 it was\r\npresented to the museum.\r\n\r\nA beautiful and costly figure of this nature was completed a year or two\r\nago by the court jeweler, Alfred Dragsen, of Copenhagen. This is nearly\r\nfour inches in height, and represents a female snake-charmer. A very\r\nlong baroque pearl forms the body from the shoulders to the knees, and\r\nthe head, arms, and the legs below the knees are of gold. The figure is\r\nornamented with a diamond-studded garland, ruby necklace and earrings,\r\nand garters set with similar gems, a red enameled girdle ornamented with\r\npearls, and golden anklets with black pearls. With a flute she charms a\r\nserpent twined about her body and grasped with the other hand.\r\n\r\nWhat is said to be the finest collection of black pearls in all Europe\r\nis that belonging to the Duchess of Anhalt Dessau, Germany. It consists\r\nof three large caskets of black pearls that have taken a century to\r\ncollect. It is traditional in the family that these pearls are never to\r\nbe sold except as their last possession, since they know they will\r\nalways find a purchaser.\r\n\r\nA collection of pearls had been kept for many years in the Monte de\r\nPiedad of Mexico City, which it was claimed had been pawned by a friend\r\nof the Empress Carlotta, in order to provide her with money at the time\r\nof the assassination of Emperor Maximilian. These pearls were contained\r\nin a necklace and a pearl and diamond tiara, which were sewn upon\r\ncardboard covered with black velvet, and had the appearance of not\r\nhaving been disturbed for many years. The necklace consisted of old\r\npearls, both of the so-called Madras and Panama varieties; in the center\r\nwas a large diamond medallion from which pear-shaped pearls were\r\nsuspended. It is believed that these pearls were part of Empress\r\nCarlotta’s marriage portion, and that they came from the Austrian crown\r\njewel collection. None of them possessed much quality with the exception\r\nof one, a large pear-shaped pearl which was set at the base of the\r\nnecklace and weighed eighty-four grains. The drilling of this pearl was\r\nof a very old style, being of that type in which a tube is inserted in\r\nthe drill hole, through which a gold wire passes to hold the pearl; a\r\ndiamond is then set at the base of the tube to disguise the drill mark.\r\nIt is, however, possible that the pearl came from the East Indies, where\r\nlarge drill holes are usual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MADAM NORDICA\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe pearls were sent in bond to the United States as a collection, and\r\nthen to Europe, where they were sold separately, the pear-shaped pearl\r\nappearing again in the New York market in 1906. There has been some\r\ndoubt as to these really being Carlotta’s pearls, but the Mexican\r\naccount is fairly consistent, and it satisfactorily disposes of the\r\nnewspaper romance in which it was claimed that Carlotta had taken these\r\npearls with her to Europe and that they had been buried in a casket in\r\nthe Adriatic Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT AUCTION SALES. In England and in France, more than in the United\r\nStates, great auction sales of jewels are common. They are held in\r\nLondon, principally at Christie’s, originally a coffee house,\r\nestablished in 1880; and in Paris, at the Hôtel Drouot. Good prices are\r\ngenerally realized, as the buyers of the entire continent attend these\r\ngreat sales. The purchases are usually made by dealers who frequently do\r\nnot neglect each other’s interests if private buyers are present. No\r\nmatter how great may be the amount involved, no matter whether the\r\ncollections consist of paintings, furniture, or jewels, there are always\r\nbuyers, to a much greater extent than in the United States. The price\r\nfor fine jewels may naturally vary a trifle in the different markets,\r\naccording to the conditions of payment. It must evidently make an\r\nappreciable difference whether almost the entire amount is paid in cash\r\nor whether a credit of thirty days is extended, or one for a much longer\r\nperiod, in some countries for as long as one, two, or even three years.\r\n\r\nWhile in the United States such sales of valuable jewels are very\r\nunusual, it has been a custom in England and in France for many years,\r\nin the settlement of estates, to sell not only the furniture,\r\nbric-à-brac, etc., but also the jewels. Sales of this kind are naturally\r\ncalculated to attract not only the dealers, but also many rich\r\ncollectors and connoisseurs, and as they are frequently widely\r\nadvertised, and London and Paris are, at the most, but one to two days’\r\njourney from all parts of Europe, many people attend, most of the\r\nprivate buyers being represented by their agents. By means of these\r\nsales many heirlooms, which have been handed down from generation to\r\ngeneration, often pass into the possession of strangers. In the matter\r\nof jewels, it has been frequently noticed that dealers are in the\r\nmajority of cases the ultimate buyers, and it has also been inferred\r\nthat when an outsider participates in the bidding, the prices are\r\nadvanced to such an extent that it does not often appear profitable for\r\nhim to buy in the face of such competition. All manner of people have\r\nhad their estates disposed of in this way, and the list of these sales\r\nduring the past twenty years is a striking one: royalty, nobility,\r\nmerchants, and people in many other conditions of life find a place in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIt is not an infrequent custom in London for solicitors to advance money\r\non jewels, and when the payments are not forthcoming these jewels are\r\nsold. Hence, many sales appear at the larger auction rooms in which no\r\nname is given, the owners frequently being people of high degree.\r\n\r\n  On July 19, 1892, a necklace containing eighty-five graduated pearls\r\n  of unusual size and quality, the property of the late H. W. F.\r\n  Bolchow, M.P., was sold in London for the sum of £2500 ($12,500).\r\n  Another necklace of 146 fine graduated pearls disposed in two rows,\r\n  brought £2400 ($12,000); a single-row necklace of eighty-five pearls\r\n  realized £1600 ($8000), and one of 118 pearls in two rows £1660\r\n  ($8300).\r\n\r\n  An exceptionally fine pearl necklace which belonged to her Grace the\r\n  late Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, mother of the present Duke of\r\n  Montrose, was sold at Christie’s on April 30, 1895. The necklace\r\n  comprised 362 graduated pearls, arranged in seven rows of\r\n  forty-four, forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty-two,\r\n  fifty-eight, and sixty-four pearls, respectively. The amount\r\n  realized for this ornament was £11,500 ($57,500).\r\n\r\n  On July 9, 1901, a pearl necklace, advertised as the property of “a\r\n  French lady of rank,” and several other valuable pearl ornaments,\r\n  were offered at Christie’s. It is supposed by many that these jewels\r\n  belonged to Madame Humbert. The necklace was composed of six rows of\r\n  graduated pearls consisting of fifty-five, sixty-one, sixty-seven,\r\n  seventy-three, seventy-nine, and eighty-nine pearls, respectively, a\r\n  total of 424, all of good color and luster. A London dealer\r\n  considers that they owed their value mainly to skilful matching and\r\n  fineness of color; they are perhaps a century old. As may be\r\n  supposed, there were many bidders who competed eagerly for\r\n  possession of this fine ornament, and it was at last adjudged for\r\n  the sum of £20,000 ($100,000). While this was, up to that date, a\r\n  record price in an auction room, it was by no means an exceptional\r\n  figure for private sales; indeed, at about the time this necklace\r\n  was sold, a London dealer disposed of another for £34,000\r\n  ($170,000).\r\n\r\n  A necklace, the property of the late Lady Matheson of the Lews, was\r\n  sold at Christie’s, March 5, 1902. Well-matched and graduated round\r\n  pearls, to the number of 233, were disposed in four rows, and strung\r\n  with seed-pearls between. This necklace, which had been presented to\r\n  Lady Matheson at the time of her marriage in 1843 by Sir Jamsetjee\r\n  Jejeebhoy, Bart., brought the sum of £6800 ($34,000).\r\n\r\n  A pearl necklace, containing fifty-three fine and graduated pearls,\r\n  was sold in London, June 9, 1902, for the sum of £2250 ($11,250).\r\n  Another necklace of sixty-eight fine round pearls, one of which\r\n  formed the clasp, brought £1580 ($7900). A beautiful pearl and\r\n  brilliant pendant of open scroll design, with a large, round white\r\n  pearl in the center, and a large, pear-shaped black pearl as drop,\r\n  realized £800 ($4000), and a pearl collar of ten rows of round\r\n  pearls brought £820 ($4100). A noteworthy offering at this sale was\r\n  a rope of 135 pearls, an heirloom sold under the will of Lady\r\n  Marianna Augusta Hamilton. These pearls had been given to Lady\r\n  Augusta Anne Cockburn in 1769 on the occasion of her marriage to Sir\r\n  James Cockburn, Bart., by her godmother, Augusta, Duchess of\r\n  Brunswick, sister to George III. The rope was sold for £900 ($4500).\r\n\r\n  The pearls of Lady Dudley were sold at Christie’s on July 4, 1902.\r\n  Among them was a magnificent necklace of forty-seven slightly\r\n  graduated round pearls, of large size and unusually brilliant\r\n  orient; their gross weight was 1090 grains. This necklace brought\r\n  the sum of £22,200 ($111,000). A single pear-shaped pearl of the\r\n  finest orient mounted with a diamond cap, as a pendant, and weighing\r\n  209 grains, was sold for £13,500 ($67,500). A rope of 222 graduated\r\n  round pearls of the highest quality, weighing 2320 grains was\r\n  purchased for £16,700 ($83,500), and a pearl and brilliant tiara\r\n  brought £10,300 ($51,500). The entire casket of thirty-one lots\r\n  realized £89,526 ($447,630).\r\n\r\n  At the sale of the jewels of Mlle. Wanda de Boncza, at the Hôtel\r\n  Drouot, Paris, December 6, 1902, a fine necklace was disposed of for\r\n  the sum of 150,000 francs ($30,000), and a rope of 100 small pearls\r\n  realized 38,100 francs ($7620); the proceeds of the entire sale of\r\n  these jewels were 1,249,578 francs ($249,915).\r\n\r\n  Among the Aqualia jewels, sold in London in 1903, was a pearl\r\n  necklace that brought £4480 ($22,400).\r\n\r\n  The jewels of the late Marquis of Anglesey, an enthusiastic jewel\r\n  and art collector, were disposed of at Christie’s on May 4 and 5,\r\n  1904. At the time of his death, the marquis was supposed to be a\r\n  bankrupt, but the value of the gems which he had purchased had\r\n  increased so rapidly that the sale realized the sum of £22,988 10s.\r\n  ($114,942), more than enough to cover all the obligations of the\r\n  estate. Of this amount a magnificent drop pearl, mounted as a\r\n  scarf-pin, brought £4000 ($20,000); another drop pearl of the finest\r\n  orient, weighing 105½ grains, but slightly cracked, was sold for\r\n  £3700 ($18,500). Four other drop-shaped pearls, mounted as\r\n  scarf-pins, were sold for £5220 ($26,100), one of them bringing\r\n  £1720 ($8600). A single bouton pearl, used as a coat fastener,\r\n  realized £980 ($4900), and a pearl trefoil was purchased for £580\r\n  ($2900). One fine large bouton pearl, set as a stud, was disposed of\r\n  for £3000 ($15,000), and another somewhat smaller bouton, also set\r\n  as a stud, brought £1600 ($8000).\r\n\r\n  A splendid necklace comprising forty-nine well-matched and graduated\r\n  pearls of fine quality, weighing 563½ grains, was sold in London on\r\n  June 29, 1905, for the sum of £4700 ($23,500). At the same sale a\r\n  necklace of thirty-two graduated pearls, weighing about 890 grains,\r\n  brought £2600 ($13,000).\r\n\r\n  On July 20, 1905, a pearl necklace comprising forty-five graduated\r\n  pearls of fine orient, with a cabochon ruby clasp, the gross weight\r\n  being 832 grains, was sold in London for £3150 ($15,750).\r\n\r\n  A fine pearl and brilliant pendant was disposed of at the sale in\r\n  London, February 21, 1906, of the stock of Mr. E. M. Marcoso. This\r\n  pendant was composed of one large white brilliant, weighing 18–1⁄32\r\n  carats, and a drop-shaped pearl weighing 75¾ grains. The ornament\r\n  brought the sum of £2050 ($10,250).\r\n\r\n  A pearl necklace composed of 285 well-matched and graduated pearls\r\n  disposed in five rows was sold in London on June 13, 1906, for the\r\n  sum of £10,000 ($50,000). At the same sale a three-row necklace,\r\n  with 213 graduated and matched pearls of fine orient, brought £3200\r\n  ($16,000), and a rope of 237 fine pearls realized £2800 ($14,000).\r\n\r\n  Among the jewels disposed of at a sale in London on July 11, 1906,\r\n  may be mentioned a five-row pearl necklace of 445 graduated oriental\r\n  pearls which was sold for £2500 ($12,500). Three other necklaces\r\n  were offered at the same sale; one of fifty-five matched and\r\n  graduated pearls of fine quality bringing £3400 ($17,000); one of\r\n  fifty-seven pearls, £2700 ($13,500), and the other of 219\r\n  well-matched and graduated pearls realizing £2350 ($11,750). Still\r\n  another necklace of 417 matched and graduated pearls arranged in\r\n  five rows was sold for £4800 ($24,000). A splendid pearl drop, of\r\n  the finest orient, brought £1650 ($8250), and a pearl rope of 191\r\n  oriental pearls, arranged so as to form three single-row necklaces,\r\n  realized the sum of £3700 ($18,500), three fine black pearls,\r\n  mounted as studs, were sold for £1000 ($5000). The most important\r\n  necklace was reserved for the end of the sale; this was composed of\r\n  forty-seven large oriental pearls, and was purchased for the sum of\r\n  £10,000 ($50,000).\r\n\r\n  At the sale of the Massey-Mainwaring collection at Christie’s on\r\n  March 18, 1907, a five-row pearl necklace consisting of 471\r\n  graduated pearls, with a bouton pearl in the center, was sold for\r\n  £4600 ($23,000).\r\n\r\n  Another collection, sold at Christie’s, April 15, 1907, was the\r\n  property of the late Mrs. Lewis-Hill, and the proceeds of the first\r\n  day’s sale reached the heretofore unapproached total of £94,805\r\n  ($474,025), thus exceeding by $26,395 the amount obtained in one day\r\n  by the sale of Lady Dudley’s jewels. Among the valuable pearls in\r\n  this collection, we may mention a pair of large bouton pearl\r\n  earrings, with small diamond tops, which brought £1180 ($5900). The\r\n  enthusiasm and interest of the assembly were aroused by a necklace\r\n  of forty-five large, graduated pearls of fine orient, with a bouton\r\n  pearl and brilliant cluster snap; after spirited bidding this was\r\n  bought for £6100 ($30,500). The greatest event of the day, however,\r\n  was the appearance of a splendid rope of 229 pearls of very good\r\n  form, well-matched and graduated. The opening bid was £10,000\r\n  ($50,000) and after a warm contest the pearls were finally acquired\r\n  for the sum of £16,700 ($83,500). A necklace consisting of fifteen\r\n  graduated drops, each formed of one bouton pearl, one brilliant, and\r\n  one pear-shaped pearl drop, depending from a narrow band of small\r\n  diamonds, drew forth a bid of £5000 ($25,000) and was finally\r\n  awarded for the sum of £12,200 ($61,000). A pearl rope of 183\r\n  graduated and well-matched pearls realized £7200 ($36,000), and a\r\n  fine pair of pearls set as earrings brought £3400 ($17,000). The\r\n  crowded auction room, the keen competition among the bidders, and\r\n  the amount obtained for these jewels are good indications of the\r\n  firmness of the market at the present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1907, by Theo. C. Marceau, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  MRS. GEORGE J. GOULD\r\n]\r\n\r\n  At the sale of the jewels of Lady Henry Gordon-Lennox, held at\r\n  Christie’s on May 12, 1907, a splendid necklace was offered. It\r\n  comprised 287 graduated pearls of the finest orient, disposed in\r\n  five rows, with a large circular pearl. This magnificent ornament\r\n  was sold for £25,500 ($127,500).\r\n\r\n  On July 11, 1907, a splendid necklace of forty-nine graduated\r\n  pearls, of fine luster and carefully matched, was sold at auction by\r\n  Debenham and Storr of London, for the sum of £5600 ($28,000). At the\r\n  same sale a single-row necklace of forty-five pearls brought £5300\r\n  ($26,500), and a rope of oriental pearls realized £4500 ($22,500).\r\n\r\n  At the auction sale of the collection of the late Bishop Bubics of\r\n  Hungary, among other objects, a very handsome saber pouch was\r\n  offered, of the style worn by the Hungarian hussars. It was of green\r\n  silk and richly embroidered with hundreds of pearls of varying\r\n  sizes. After a spirited competition this pouch was sold to Prince\r\n  Esterhazy for 13,500 crowns ($2700). Some time after the sale a\r\n  letter from the late bishop was found, containing the statement that\r\n  he had borrowed the ornament from the jewel-room of the Princess\r\n  Esterhazy.

This is of great interest in view\r\nof the unique system of burial and the great variety of objects buried\r\nwith the pearls. It is evident from the quantities discovered in some of\r\nthe mounds that a very great number of pearls, many of large size, must\r\nhave been owned by these aborigines, and they were evidently quite\r\nexpert in the art of drilling them. Pearls must have been freely used\r\nfor ornamental purposes, and it is clear that many rivers in this region\r\nmust have produced them in great numbers, when we consider that in all\r\nprobability the mussels were taken only as they were required for food\r\nor for bait in fishing, and had probably reached their full growth.\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that pearls were used on this continent for a long\r\nperiod, and they may have been in use centuries before any employment\r\nwas made of them in Europe. In the age of the mound-builders there were\r\nas many pearls in the possession of a single tribe of Indians as existed\r\nin any European court. We have no means of ascertaining the precise date\r\nof any of these burials, and there are no historical records relating to\r\nthis region, such as were kept in Mexico as well as in Europe and Asia.\r\nNo trace has been found of the employment of pearls, either for\r\ndecoration or ornament, by the aborigines of Europe or Asia; either they\r\ndid not use them or else the pearls have entirely passed away in the\r\ncourse of twenty or more centuries. We do know, however, that neither\r\npearls nor Unio shells were used by any of the lake-dwellers of\r\nSwitzerland or the adjacent countries.\r\n\r\nMany eminent archæologists have investigated the finding and history of\r\nthe pearls of the mound-builders of Ohio and Alabama, especially Squier\r\nand Davis, F. W. Putnam, Warren K. Moorehead, C. C. Jones, W. C. Mills,\r\nand Clarence B. Moore. The discoveries made up to 1890 were fully\r\ntreated by one of the writers in several pamphlets (one of them, “Gems\r\nand Precious Stones of North America”).\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that the Indians of the Atlantic coast may have known\r\nof pearls from the common clam as well as from the edible oyster. The\r\nformer may have often contained pearls weighing from fifty to one\r\nhundred grains each, as at that period the mollusks were permitted to\r\nattain their full growth, and perhaps were not eaten except when they\r\nwere as small as little-neck clams; the larger ones were sought for the\r\npurple spot which held the muscle, and was used for wampum. We have no\r\nrecord of the finding of pearls in any graves north of Virginia, as the\r\nmany graves opened in the past century have failed to reveal them, nor\r\nhas the use of pearls been mentioned by any of the early writers. They\r\nmay have been worn, but if so they have passed away or may have been\r\nmistaken for ashes if they had decrepitated.\r\n\r\nThe first English settlers found the Indians of the tidewater region of\r\nwhat now constitutes the Middle States using pearls quite freely and\r\nesteeming them among their favorite treasures and ornaments. Captain\r\nJohn Smith, and all the early chroniclers of the Virginia colony, have\r\ngiven many accounts of this aboriginal use of pearls.\r\n\r\nIn view of the general interest awakened by the tercentenary of the\r\nfounding of Jamestown, and the exposition in commemoration thereof, the\r\n“American Anthropologist” devoted its first number for 1907 principally\r\nto topics relating to the Virginia Indians.[527] Among these articles is\r\none of much interest by Mr. Charles C. Willoughby, of the Peabody Museum\r\nat Cambridge, Massachusetts, dealing with the tribes occupying tidewater\r\nVirginia at the time of the first colonization, their habits and\r\ncustoms, their distribution, and their subsequent history of diminution\r\nand almost of extinction. These were a branch of the Algonquian stock,\r\nand extended as far south as the Neuse River in North Carolina. To the\r\nsouth and west they were hemmed in by tribes of Iroquoian and Siouan\r\nrace, and on the north they were separated from other hostile Indians by\r\nthe Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. The powerful confederacy under\r\nPowhatan comprised some thirty tribes or “provinces,” covering most of\r\nthe tidewater region of Virginia proper. To the greater chiefs, John\r\nSmith states that tribute was paid, consisting of “skinnes, beads,\r\ncopper, pearle, deere, turkies, wild beasts and corne.”[528] Many other\r\nreferences in this article confirm and illustrate this general\r\nstatement, especially regarding pearls, both as to their use by the\r\nliving and their deposit with the remains of the dead.\r\n\r\nIn the account given of the native clothing, the outer mantles are\r\ndescribed, made usually of deerskin with the hair removed, and bordered\r\nwith a fringe. These were often “couloured with some pretty work, ...\r\nbeasts, fowle, tortayses, or such like imagery,”[529] or adorned with\r\nshells, white beads, copper ornaments, pearls, or the teeth of\r\nanimals.[530] Strachey describes a wonderful cloak made of feather-work,\r\nbelonging to an Indian princess, the wife of a deposed chief, Pipisco;\r\nwith it she wore “pendants of great but imperfect couloured and worse\r\ndrilled pearles, which she put into her eares,” besides a long necklace\r\nmade of copper links.[531]\r\n\r\nWith regard to such ornaments, Mr. Willoughby says (p. 71) that “the\r\nears of both sexes were pierced with great holes, the women commonly\r\nhaving three in each ear, in which were hung strings of bones, shell,\r\nand copper beads, copper pendants, and other ornaments. Captain Amidas\r\nmet the wife of a chief who wore in her ears strings of pearl beads as\r\nlarge as ‘great pease’ which hung down to her middle.[532] The husband\r\nof this woman wore five or six copper pendants in each ear. It was a\r\ncommon custom for the men to wear a claw of a hawk, eagle, turkey, or\r\nbear, or even a live snake as an ear ornament.”\r\n\r\n“Bracelets and neck ornaments of various kinds of beads were common.\r\nBeads of copper seem to have been most highly valued in the early\r\ncolonial period. These were made of ‘shreeds of copper, beaten thinne\r\nand bright, and wound up hollowe,’ and were sometimes strung alternately\r\nwith pearls which were occasionally stained to render them more\r\nattractive.[533] Beads of polished bone or shell were strung into\r\nnecklaces either alone or with perforated pearls or copper beads. Some\r\nof these chains were long enough to pass several times around the neck.\r\nNecklaces of such construction as to be easily identified were worn by\r\nmessengers as a proof of good faith. Powhatan gave Sir Thomas Dale a\r\npearl necklace, and requested that any messenger sent by Dale to him\r\nshould wear it as a guaranty that the message was authentic.”[534]\r\n\r\n“Pearls of various shapes and sizes were comparatively common, but\r\nsymmetrical pearls of uniform size were more rare. Strachey writes of\r\nhaving seen ‘manie chaynes and braceletts (of pearls) worne by the\r\npeople, and wee have found plentie of them in the sepulchers of their\r\nkings, though discoloured by burning the oysters in the fier, and\r\ndeformed by grosse boring.’ One of Hariot’s companions obtained from the\r\nIndians about five thousand pearls, from which a sufficient number of\r\ngood quality and of uniform size were obtained to make a ‘fayre chaine,\r\nwhich for their likenesse and uniformitie in roundnesse, orientness and\r\npidenesse of many excellent colours, with equalitie in greatnesse, were\r\nverie fayre and rare.’[535]\r\n\r\n“Those who have examined the thousands of pearls from the Ohio mounds,\r\nto be mentioned later, can readily understand these conditions. The\r\npearl beads from the mounds vary in diameter from about an eighth of an\r\ninch to nearly an inch, the great majority being small and irregular,\r\nalthough there are many among them of good form and value. It is\r\nprobable that most of the Virginia pearls were obtained from the\r\nfresh-water mussel (Unio)”; not unlikely from the common marine clam\r\n(_Venus mercenaria_), or the common oyster (_Ostrea virginica_).\r\n\r\nAs regards the burial of pearls with the dead and their use in religious\r\nrites, curious and quite full accounts are given by Strachey, Smith,\r\nHariot, and Beverley.[536] There was a “temple,” also occupied as a\r\nresidence by one or more priests, in the territory of every chief. This\r\nbuilding was usually some eighteen or twenty feet wide, and varied in\r\nlength from thirty to one hundred feet, with an entrance at the eastern\r\nend, and the western portion partitioned off with mats to form a sort of\r\nsanctuary or “chancel.” Within this were kept the dried bodies of\r\ndeceased chiefs, and an image of the god, called Okee, made in the shape\r\nof a man, “all black, dressed with chaynes of perle.” Full descriptions\r\nof these idols and their manufacture are given by Hariot and Beverley,\r\nalso of the process of preserving the remains of the chiefs.[537] After\r\nthe body had been disemboweled, the skin was laid back and the flesh was\r\ncut away from the bones. When this operation was completed, the\r\nskeleton, held together by its ligaments, was again inclosed in the\r\nskin, and stuffed with white sand, or with “pearle, copper, beads, and\r\nsuch trash sowed in a skynne.”[538] It was then dressed in fine skins\r\nand adorned with all sorts of valuables, including strings of pearls and\r\nbeads. The same kinds of treasures were also deposited in a basket at\r\nthe feet of the mummy.\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith describes the temple of Powhatan, at Uttamussack, which\r\nwas in charge of seven priests, and was held in great awe by “the\r\nsalvages.” At a place called Orapaks, was also his treasure-house, fifty\r\nor sixty yards long, frequented only by priests, where he kept a great\r\namount of skins, beads, pearls, and copper, stored up against the time\r\nof his death and burial. A vivid account is given of the four grotesque\r\nimages that stood guard at the corners of this building, all made “evill\r\nfavouredly according to their best workmanship.”[539]\r\n\r\nThe use of pearls as ornaments, and their deposit with the remains of\r\nchiefs and persons of distinction, have already been described as\r\nfamiliar among the Indian tribes of tidewater Virginia, in the notes\r\nabove cited from early explorers and colonists. It is a curious\r\ncircumstance, however, that this habit does not appear to have extended\r\nin that part of the country much beyond the dominions of Powhatan, as no\r\npearls have been noted in the Indian graves in Maryland. This statement,\r\nin reply to a letter of special inquiry, is made by Dr. P. R. Uhler, of\r\nthe Peabody Institute of Baltimore, who has been making very careful\r\nstudies of all aboriginal remains in that region, for the Maryland\r\nAcademy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from this and other evidence, that the use and\r\nappreciation of pearls must have been in some way a tribal matter,\r\nfamiliar to some and not to others, of the Indian peoples. In the\r\nMississippi Valley, the ancient population known as the mound-builders,\r\nby some regarded as a distinct and earlier race, and by others as of\r\ntrue Indian stock, although much more advanced in arts and culture, have\r\nleft in their mounds most remarkable quantities of pearls. But here\r\nagain, the same feature appears, that these treasures are not found\r\nwherever there are mounds, but only in certain regions. Of these, by far\r\nthe most celebrated is that of the Scioto and Miami valleys, in Ohio.\r\nOutside of these, no large amounts have been found, and only at a few\r\nlocalities are they met with at all.\r\n\r\nThe valleys of the Miami and Scioto rivers and their tributaries contain\r\nmany remarkable mounds and “earthworks,” which have attracted much\r\nattention, and have been more or less explored at different times, with\r\nincreasing care and thoroughness as archæological science has advanced.\r\nIt may be well to give a brief, general account of these investigations\r\nand some leading features of the mounds as a whole, before going into\r\nparticulars as to the occurrence of pearls.\r\n\r\nThe first important and scientific study of these remarkable structures\r\nwas that conducted in the early forties by Dr. Edwin H. Davis and Mr. E.\r\nGeorge Squier, and published in their celebrated and standard work\r\nentitled “Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley,” issued by the\r\nSmithsonian Institution in 1848. This book and the “Correspondence” in\r\nregard to the mounds by the same writers, published in 1847, were the\r\nfirst works issued by the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nAccording to Squier and Davis,[540] two quarts of pearls were originally\r\ndeposited in one of these mounds. The writers consider that the pearls\r\nwere probably derived from the fisheries in the southern waters, and\r\nthey regard their presence in the Ohio mounds as a proof of “an\r\nextensive communication with southern and tropical regions and a\r\nmigration from that direction.”\r\n\r\nA number of pearls or pearl beads from the Ohio mounds and which\r\nformerly belonged to the Squier and Davis collection, are now in the\r\nBlackmore Museum at Salisbury, England. According to a communication\r\nfrom Dr. H. P. Blackmore, director of the museum, these pearls, which\r\noriginally formed five necklaces, have been much injured by the action\r\nof fire at the time the bodies of those interred in the mounds were\r\nburned. Mr. Blackmore considers that the greater part of the pearl beads\r\nare of mother-of-pearl cut from some large shell, made into a round\r\nshape and perforated, but, after very careful examination, he is of the\r\nopinion that about ten may be classed as natural pearls. Their present\r\ncolor is a dull, leaden gray, rather lighter than the “black pearl” of\r\ncommerce. The size of these pearls or beads varies from four millimeters\r\nto twenty millimeters in diameter. One of the necklaces consists of\r\nthirty-three beads well graduated, but of a dead white color from the\r\naction of the earth.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century later, when the Centennial Exposition was in\r\npreparation, the Smithsonian Institution undertook the formation of a\r\npublic exhibit illustrating American archæology, and engaged Prof. F. W.\r\nPutnam, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to open and examine some of the\r\nmost remarkable of the mounds described by Squier and Davis. These\r\nexplorations were continued for some years, partly for the government\r\nand partly for the Peabody Museum of Archæology at Cambridge, and their\r\nresults were exhibited at the Columbian Exposition in 1893. The mounds\r\nexplored were chiefly in the valley of the Little Miami, and\r\nparticularly those known as the Turner group.\r\n\r\nA very important series of explorations was also carried on by Mr.\r\nWarren K. Moorehead, covering the years from 1887 to 1893, largely in\r\npreparation for the Columbian Exposition. These investigations were\r\nmainly in the Scioto valley, in the counties of Ross, Franklin, and\r\nPickaway, Ohio. Among the most important results then obtained were\r\nthose from the mounds of the “Porter” and “Hopewell” groups, in Ross\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nSince that time, much valuable work has been done by Mr. Moorehead and\r\nothers, and particularly under the auspices of the Ohio State\r\nArchæological and Historical Society. The latest and most complete\r\ninvestigation was made for this society in 1903, by its curator, Prof.\r\nWilliam C. Mills, in the Harness mound, seven miles north of\r\nChillicothe, Ohio, near the Scioto River, in Ross County. This locality\r\nhad been previously explored in part, by Professor Putnam in 1885, and\r\nMr. Moorehead in 1896; it was now systematically examined down to the\r\noriginal surface at every point.\r\n\r\nSquier and Davis divided these ancient monuments into four classes: (1)\r\nAltar mounds, which contain what appear to be altars, and are also\r\ncalled hearths, of stone or hardened clay; (2) Burial mounds, containing\r\nhuman bones; (3) Temple mounds, with neither altars nor bones, but\r\nseeming to have had some special religious significance; and (4)\r\nAnomalous mounds, including “mounds of observation” and others of mixed\r\nor uncertain character. The burials are found to be of two kinds, simple\r\ninterment and cremation; and these are sometimes met with in the same\r\nmound.\r\n\r\nThis classification has been generally followed in describing these\r\nancient structures, although the whole subject is obscure and difficult,\r\nfrom our ignorance of the purposes and conditions of their formation. In\r\nmany of the mounds of the first two classes especially, not only have\r\npearls been found, but quantities of interesting and remarkable objects,\r\nmany of which have been brought from distant points, and prove clearly\r\nthe existence of an extensive intertribal commerce at a remote period.\r\nGalena from Illinois and Wisconsin, mica from North Carolina, obsidian\r\nfrom beyond the Rocky Mountains, and sea-shells from the Gulf coast, are\r\namong these objects, and particularly native copper from Lake Superior,\r\nfrom which many articles were fashioned by hammering. Pearls are\r\nextremely abundant, and were at first supposed to have been brought from\r\nthe coast, and may have been the pearls of the common clam and the\r\ncommon oyster, the pearls being found in opening the mollusks for food;\r\nbut the recent development of pearl hunting in the western rivers, where\r\nthe fresh-water mussels (Unios) are so abundant and produce such\r\nbeautiful pearls, shows that these treasures were undoubtedly gathered,\r\npartly, if not wholly, in the region where the mounds exist. The\r\nenormous numbers found are, indeed, no source of surprise, as such\r\nquantities of pearls have been obtained, for over twenty years past,\r\nfrom the same regions. The mollusks are still abundant in all the\r\nstreams of the Mississippi Valley, except where they have been reduced\r\nor exterminated by the reckless methods of pearl hunting employed where\r\nthe “pearl fever” has prevailed.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that the fresh-water Unios were not sought for\r\ntheir pearls alone, but were also used as food, and perhaps as bait for\r\nfishing. They were evidently gathered in great quantities, as is shown\r\nby the old heaps of shells found along the banks of streams at many\r\npoints; and doubtless there are multitudes of such heaps that have never\r\nbeen observed. They are known as far north as Idaho, as communicated by\r\nDr. Robert N. Bell, State mineralogist, and they extend still farther\r\nnorth, as noted by Dr. Harlan I. Smith, in his “Preliminary Notes on the\r\nArchæology of the Yakima Valley.”[541] He says: “Small heaps of\r\nfresh-water clam-shells were examined, but these being only about five\r\nfeet in diameter and as many inches in depth, are hardly to be compared\r\nto the immense shell-heaps of the coast.”\r\n\r\nThese Unio shell-heaps are frequent in the South, and some of the\r\nSpanish chroniclers of De Soto’s expedition in 1540–1541, describe the\r\ngathering and cooking of the mussels, and the finding of occasional\r\npearls therein. The same writers also give glowing accounts of the\r\npearls possessed by the natives. Some of these accounts may be\r\nexaggerated, but they cannot be wholly so. It would seem that some of\r\nthe pearls may have come from marine shells, and others from those of\r\nthe rivers and streams; but there are few pearl-producing shells on our\r\nown coasts, and it is not very likely that there was any trade or\r\nintercourse with the West Indian Islands, where marine pearls occur\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\nAlbert H. Pickett, in his “History of Alabama,” refers to the accounts\r\nof De Soto’s historian, Garcilasso de la Vega, and holds that the pearls\r\nwhich he noted were evidently from the Unios of Alabama. “Heaps of\r\nmussel shells,” he says, “are now to be seen on our river banks wherever\r\nIndians used to live. They were much used by the ancient Indians for\r\nsome purpose, and old warriors have informed me that their ancestors\r\nonce used the shells to temper the clay with which they made their\r\nvessels. But as thousands of the shells lie banked up, some deep in the\r\nground, we may also suppose that the Indians in De Soto’s time,\r\neverywhere in Alabama, obtained pearls from them. There can be no doubt\r\nabout the quantity of pearls found in this State and Georgia in 1540,\r\nbut they were of a coarser and more valueless kind than the Spaniards\r\nsupposed. The Indians used to perforate them and string them around\r\ntheir necks and arms like beads.”[542]\r\n\r\nThe use of fragments of these shells in tempering the clay for pottery,\r\nalluded to in the preceding paragraph, is well known. Prof. Daniel S.\r\nMartin describes an old village site in South Carolina, near the\r\nCongaree River, a few miles south of the city of Columbia, where the\r\nground had been plowed, and along the furrows the soil was gleaming with\r\nbrilliant pearly fragments of Unio shells, intermingled with bits of\r\npottery.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarence B. Moore discovered pearls pierced for stringing in several\r\nof the mounds at Moundville, Alabama. He also found a sheet-copper\r\npendant, elongated oval in outline, with an excised repoussé decoration,\r\nembracing a swastika within a circle, and a triangle. This pendant,\r\nwhich lay near the skull of burial No. 132, bears a perforated pearl\r\nnearly seven millimeters in diameter and weighing about nine grains; it\r\nis fastened to the pendant by a piece of vegetable fiber that passes\r\nthrough the pearl. With another burial (No. 162), the skeleton of an\r\nadult, was an elliptical gorget of sheet-copper decorated with a\r\npearl.[543] In a personal communication Mr. Moore states that all the\r\npearls found by him in the mounds were very much disintegrated by the\r\nlapse of time; he also writes that he has never found any shells\r\nimmediately with the pearls, although masses of Unio shells were often\r\nmet with in the mounds. He believes the shell-fish had been used for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nUnio shell-heaps exist likewise on the shores of the inland lakes of\r\nFlorida, and in middle Georgia and Alabama; and several of them on the\r\nbanks of the Savannah River, above Augusta, are fully described by\r\nColonel Charles C. Jones.[544] He says: “In these relic-beds no two\r\nparts of the same shell are, as a general rule, found in juxtaposition.\r\nThe hinge is broken, and the valves of the shell, after having been\r\nartificially torn asunder, seem to have been carelessly cast aside and\r\nallowed to accumulate.”\r\n\r\nThus, in addition to the historical evidence, physical proof is abundant\r\nof the pearl fisheries of the aboriginal tribes of the South. In order\r\nto ascertain the precise varieties of shells from which the southern\r\nIndians obtained their pearls, Colonel Jones invited an expression of\r\nopinion from a number of scientists whose studies rendered them familiar\r\nwith the conchology of the United States. Their responses throw\r\nconsiderable light upon this inquiry, though with some curious\r\nvariation.\r\n\r\nProf. William S. Jones, of the University of Georgia, says that he has\r\nseen small pearls in many of the Unios found in that State.\r\n\r\nProf. Jeffries Wyman, on the other hand, after a careful and extensive\r\nseries of excavations in the shell-heaps of Florida, failed to find a\r\nsingle pearl. “It is hardly probable,” he remarks, “that the Spaniards\r\ncould have been mistaken as to the fact of the ornaments of the Indians\r\nbeing pearls, but in view of their frequent exaggerations, I am almost\r\ncompelled to the belief that there was some mistake; and possibly they\r\nmay not have distinguished between the pearls and the shell beads, some\r\nof which would correspond with the size and shape of the pearls\r\nmentioned by the Spaniards.”\r\n\r\nProf. Joseph Jones, whose investigations throw much valuable light upon\r\nthe contents of the ancient tumuli of Tennessee, says: “I do not\r\nremember finding a genuine pearl in the many mounds which I have opened\r\nin the valleys of the Tennessee, the Cumberland, the Harpeth, and\r\nelsewhere. Many of the pearls described by the Spaniards were probably\r\nlittle else than polished beads cut out of large sea-shells and from the\r\nthicker portions of fresh-water mussels, and prepared so as to resemble\r\npearls. I have examined thousands of these, and they all present a\r\nlaminated structure, as if carved out of thick shells and sea conchs.”\r\nThis point will be referred to again.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Rau[545] writes: “I learned from Dr. Samuel G. Bristow, who\r\nwas a surgeon in the Army of the Cumberland during the Civil War, that\r\nmussels of the Tennessee River were occasionally eaten ‘as a change’ by\r\nthe soldiers of that corps, and pronounced no bad article of diet.\r\nShells of the Unio are sometimes found in Indian graves, where they had\r\nbeen deposited with the dead, to serve as food during the journey to the\r\nland of spirits.”\r\n\r\nDr. Brinton saw on the Tennessee River and its tributaries numerous\r\nshell-heaps consisting almost exclusively of the _Unio virginianus_\r\n(Lamarck). In every instance he found shell-heaps close to the\r\nwater-courses, on the rich alluvial bottom-land. He says: “The mollusks\r\nhad evidently been opened by placing them on a fire. The Tennessee\r\nmussel is margaritiferous, and there is no doubt but that it was from\r\nthis species that the early tribes obtained the hoards of pearls which\r\nthe historian of De Soto’s exploration estimated by bushels, and which\r\nwere so much prized as ornaments.”[546]\r\n\r\nA source has recently been pointed out whence small pearls, and perhaps\r\nsome fine specimens, could have been obtained by the Indians of Florida,\r\nand in considerable quantities. In the Unios of some of the fresh-water\r\nlakes of that State, there were found not less than 3000 pearls, most of\r\nthem small, but many large enough to be perforated and worn as beads.\r\nFrom one Unio there were taken eighty-four seed-pearls; from another,\r\nfifty; from a third, twenty, and from several, ten or twelve each. The\r\nexaminations were chiefly confined to Lake Griffin and its vicinity. It\r\nis said that upon one of the isles in Lake Okeechobee are the remains of\r\nan old pearl fishery, and it is proposed to open the shells of this\r\nlake, which are large, in hopes of finding pearls of superior size and\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe use of the pearl as an ornament by the southern Indians, and the\r\nquantities of shells opened by them in various localities, make it seem\r\nstrange that it is not more frequently met with in the relic-beds and\r\nsepulchral tumuli of that region; but, after exploring many shell- and\r\nearth-mounds, Colonel Charles C. Jones failed, except in a few\r\ninstances, to find pearls.[547] A few were obtained in an extensive\r\nrelic-bed on the Savannah River, above Augusta, the largest being four\r\ntenths of an inch in diameter, but all of them blackened by fire. Many\r\nof the smaller mounds on the coast of Georgia do not contain pearls,\r\nbecause at the period of their construction the custom of burning the\r\ndead appears to have prevailed very generally; hence, it may be that the\r\npearls were either immediately consumed or so seriously injured as to\r\ncrumble out of sight.\r\n\r\nThis absence of pearls tends somewhat to confirm the opinion that beads\r\nmade from the thicker portions of shells that were carved, perforated,\r\nand brilliant with nacre, were regarded by the imaginative Spaniards as\r\npearls. More minute investigation, however, will doubtless reveal the\r\nexistence of pearls in localities where the pearl-bearing shells were\r\ncollected. Perforated pearls have been found in an ancient\r\nburying-ground located near the bank of the Ogeechee River, in Bryan\r\nCounty, Georgia; and many years ago, after a heavy freshet on the Oconee\r\nRiver, which laid bare many Indian graves in the neighborhood of the\r\nlarge mounds on Poullain’s plantation, fully a hundred pearls of\r\nconsiderable size were gathered.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite clear that many of the pearls reported by the early\r\nSpanish voyagers were really such, although it is well known also that\r\nshell beads have been found in mounds in connection with pearls; but the\r\nnumbers found in Ohio, by Professor Putnam, Mr. Moorehead, and others,\r\nleave no room for doubt in this matter. That the Indians of the South\r\nalso had these pearls, both drilled and undrilled, is beyond question.\r\n\r\nThe same fact comes to view, however, in these various accounts, that\r\nhas been alluded to already, _viz._, that the use of pearls among the\r\naborigines appears to have been local, and probably tribal. All the\r\nfresh waters of North America contain Unios, especially in the\r\nMississippi basin and in the South, and all the Unios are more or less\r\npearl-bearing; but it is only at certain points that pearls are found\r\ndeposited in ancient graves, sometimes, however, in extraordinary\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nFather Louis Hennepin relates that the Indians along the Mississippi\r\nwore bracelets and earrings of fine pearls, which they spoilt, having\r\nnothing to bore them with but fire. He adds: “They gave us to understand\r\nthat they received them in exchange for their calumets from nations\r\ninhabiting the coast of the great lake to the southward, which I take to\r\nbe the Gulph of Florida.”[548]\r\n\r\nThe statement here made, that the Indians perforated their pearls only\r\n“with fire,” evidently refers to the use of a heated copper wire, or\r\npoint, as mentioned by Pickett and others of the early explorers. This\r\npoint is of importance, as apparently indicating a marked difference\r\nbetween the Indians met with by the first European visitors, and the\r\nmound-building people of an earlier time, among whom the perforation was\r\nmade with small stone drills. On this point, a recent letter from Prof.\r\nWm. C. Mills, who has conducted the very full exploration of the Harness\r\nmound in Ohio, is of interest. He describes the small and\r\ncarefully-wrought flint drills, which he found, and believes to have\r\nbeen made and used for this purpose. In size and form they answer all\r\nrequirements; they are delicate little implements, somewhat T-shaped or\r\ngimlet-shaped, an inch and a quarter long; the narrow boring part is\r\nabout an inch in length and tapers from one eighth of an inch to quite a\r\nfine point; the wider upper end is abruptly expanded into the transverse\r\nhandle, which is about a quarter of an inch thick, _i.e._, lengthwise of\r\nthe instrument, and half an inch in span, _i.e._, across, so as to give\r\na good hold for the fingers to rotate the drill, just as in an ordinary\r\ngimlet.\r\n\r\nPassing now to the actual discoveries of pearls in the mounds of the\r\nMississippi Valley, these will be reviewed in the order of the\r\nsuccessive explorations in which they were made known. As already\r\nstated, the only region where any large amounts have been encountered,\r\nis that of the Scioto and Miami valleys in Ohio. Even here, pearls are\r\nfound only at certain points, and though the numbers are great, the\r\ngraves which contain them are few. They were apparently buried only with\r\nthe remains of individuals of especial distinction, probably either\r\nchiefs or eminent medicine men. The accounts of recent explorations in\r\nthese mounds bring to mind very forcibly the statement before cited from\r\nCaptain John Smith, as to Powhatan’s treasure-house, where all his most\r\nvalued articles, including pearls, were collected and kept, in\r\npreparation for his death and burial. Pearls appear also to have been\r\nused only by the more cultured tribes, and were kept in the larger and\r\nmore prosperous communities exclusively. They are confined to the great\r\n“mound groups,” and are not found in isolated mounds. The tumuli of\r\nnorthern Ohio, the hill mounds, and the village sites along the smaller\r\nstreams, have yielded practically none.\r\n\r\nAccording to the manner of burial, the pearls vary greatly in their\r\npresent condition. Where they have been placed with cremated bodies,\r\nthey are, of course, much damaged, being blackened and largely\r\ndecomposed. Otherwise, although injured in color and luster, the mere\r\nfact of burial in the ground has not entirely ruined them. They are\r\ngenerally perforated, so as to be strung or attached to garments, and\r\ntraces of both these methods of use are sometimes clearly shown.\r\n\r\nThe term “pearl beads,” often employed by writers, is uncertain in\r\nmeaning; as it may refer either to actual pearls, bored so as to be\r\nstrung, or to imitations thereof made from pearly shell. With regard to\r\nthis point, although such quantities have been obtained, there seems to\r\nhave been very little close examination as to their structure, which\r\nwould at once indicate the facts, according as the minute layers of the\r\npearly material are concentric or not. The only distinct testimony is\r\nthat we have cited above from Prof. Joseph Jones,[549] who states that\r\nhe has examined large numbers, and found them to be apparently cut from\r\nshells. He makes the suggestion that they may have been carved from the\r\nthicker portions of the fresh-water Unios. This is not only probable,\r\nbut would go far to solve the mystery of the enormous numbers found, as\r\ncompared with anything known of the yield of genuine pearls by these\r\nmollusks, even with all the pearl hunting of recent years. An\r\ninteresting fact bearing directly on this question is the discovery in\r\nthe Taylor mound, at Oregonia, Warren County, Ohio, of several Unio\r\nshells in which had been made a circular hole, two thirds of an inch in\r\ndiameter, either for some ornamental use of the shell or to extract\r\npieces to be shaped into beads. These may have been made in either of\r\ntwo ways. Firstly, by breaking pieces of the shell from one of the\r\nvalves, as a lapidary “roughs out” a piece of gem material before he\r\nbegins to grind it into shape; or, secondly, by cutting out a circular\r\ndisk of shell by means of a hollow copper drill or a hollow reed, just\r\nas they perforated hard pieces of quartz or granite for pipes, or as\r\nthey trephined circular disks from the skulls. Decorated disks of Unio\r\nshell were also found in the same mound. If the ancient people made\r\nbeads in this manner, there is little difficulty in accounting for the\r\nquantities described, especially in connection with the evident\r\ngathering of Unios on a large scale, as shown by the widely distributed\r\nshell-heaps already described. They certainly did make beads from\r\nvarious marine shells, and these are found with the pearl beads in many\r\nof the mounds, as particularly noted by Professor Jones, cited above,\r\nand by others.\r\n\r\nIn the recent exploration of the Harness mound, by Professor Mills, a\r\nvery curious discovery was made of imitation pearls of a kind never\r\nbefore met with; these were made of clay, modeled apparently after the\r\nlarger natural pearls associated with them, and after being baked hard,\r\nhad been “covered with a flexible mica,” so as to resemble pearls.[550]\r\nThe mica was a silvery mica that may have been burned and would\r\npulverize into a gray powder with a pearly luster, as almost all micas\r\nare too resilient to be attached in any other way.\r\n\r\nTaking up now the history of pearl discovery in the mounds, the first\r\ndefinite record goes back to about 1844, when perforated pearls were\r\nfound by Dr. Edwin H. Davis[551] on the hearths of five distinct groups\r\nof mounds in Ohio, and sometimes in such abundance that they could be\r\ngathered by the hundred. They were generally of irregular form, mostly\r\npear-shaped, though perfectly round ones were also found among them. The\r\nsmaller specimens measured about one fourth of an inch in diameter, but\r\nthe largest had a diameter of three quarters of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe next great discovery of these Unio pearls was in the Porter group of\r\nmounds, in the Little Miami Valley, explored by Prof. Frederick W.\r\nPutnam, and Dr. Charles L. Metz, who procured over 60,000 pearls, nearly\r\ntwo bushels, drilled and undrilled, undoubtedly of Unio origin; all of\r\nthem, however, decayed or much altered, and of no commercial value. In\r\n1884 these scientists examined the Marriott mound, where they found\r\nnearly one hundred Unio shells, and among other objects of special\r\ninterest six canine teeth of bears, that were perforated by a lateral\r\nhole near the edge at the point of greatest curvature of the root, so\r\nthat by passing a cord through this, the tooth could be fastened to any\r\nobject or worn as an ornament. Two of these teeth had a hole bored\r\nthrough near the end of the root on the side opposite the lateral\r\nperforation, and the hole countersunk in order to receive a large\r\nspherical pearl, about three eighths of an inch in diameter. When the\r\nteeth were found, the pearls were in place, although chalky from decay.\r\nUpward of 250 pearl beads were found here, concerning which they say:\r\n“The pearl beads found in the several positions mentioned are natural\r\npearls, probably obtained from the several species of Unios in the Ohio\r\nrivers. In size they vary from one tenth of an inch to over half an inch\r\nin diameter, and many are spherical. They are neatly drilled, and the\r\nlarger from opposite sides. These pearls are now chalky, and crumble on\r\nhandling, but when fresh they would have formed brilliant necklaces and\r\npendants.”[552]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Necklace of fresh-water pearls and cut shell beads, from Mound No. 25\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Bear-tooth inlaid with fresh-water pearl from the neck of skeleton No.\r\n    209, Mound 23\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Perforation in charred, cut fresh-water pearl; weight, 5569 grams\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Perforated fresh-water pearl; weight, 22,955 grams\r\n]\r\n\r\n  FRESH-WATER PEARLS FROM HOPEWELL GROUP OF MOUNDS, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see, even at a glance, that most of those in this great\r\ndeposit of 60,000 are true pearls. Many are very irregular in form, and\r\nquite a number are the elongated, somewhat feather-shaped, “hinge\r\npearls,” that are found in the region of the hinge teeth of Unios. A\r\nlarge and interesting exhibit of these is shown in the Field Museum of\r\nNatural History, Chicago. But thousands of spherical pearls were also\r\nobtained, from the “altars” or “hearths” of mounds belonging to the\r\nfirst division of Squier and Davis’s classification, above noted. From\r\nthe Turner group, in Clermont County, in the Little Miami Valley,\r\nProfessor Putnam obtained for the Peabody Museum as much as half a\r\nbushel of pearls of this character. As these had been exposed to fire,\r\nnearly all were blackened, some cracked, and all greatly impaired.[553]\r\n\r\nThe next great series of explorations were those conducted by Mr. W. K.\r\nMoorehead in the Scioto Valley, in the counties of Ross, Franklin and\r\nPickaway, Ohio. He opened and examined a number of mounds, and found\r\npearls or pearl beads in ten or twelve of them, but the larger deposits\r\nwere confined to certain limited districts, which seem to have been\r\noccupied by tribes more advanced in culture and in traffic than the\r\nrest. In these, the pearls and also objects of other kinds brought from\r\na distance, are principally found. The scattered mounds, not associated\r\nwith any village or community sites, have few of these valuable objects.\r\n\r\nBut even where they are found freely, pearls were apparently used or\r\npossessed by only a few individuals. Mr. Moorehead investigated in all\r\n117 burial mounds, containing about 1400 skeletons. Pearls were met with\r\nin only seven of these mounds, and in connection with but twenty-two\r\nskeletons. These, however, yielded a total of 2600 pearls, apparently\r\nfrom Unios, the numbers found with single skeletons varying from 18 to\r\n602, an average of 118. It thus appears that in Mr. Moorehead’s\r\nresearches, pearls were found in about one mound out of seventeen, and\r\nin these, with about one skeleton out of eight.\r\n\r\nFrom “altar mounds,” pearls have been in some cases taken in vast\r\nnumbers. Professor Putnam’s discoveries are mentioned above; and Mr.\r\nMoorehead obtained tens of thousands from two altars or hearths in the\r\nHopewell group, which will be described hereafter.\r\n\r\nWhen found in the burial mounds with skeletons, pearls are generally\r\nseen to have been placed at the wrists or ankles, or about the neck, or\r\nin the mouth. Sometimes they are found on copper plates, and\r\noccasionally they show evidence of having been sewn or attached to a\r\ngarment. Particulars on these points will be given further on. Mr.\r\nMoorehead has also found bears’ teeth, set with pearls, as Putnam and\r\nMetz did in the Marriott mound, lying with or near skeletons.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the altar mounds, there seems to have been a different\r\nprocedure, not a burial, but a great funeral sacrifice in honor of some\r\nvery distinguished person, in which treasures of every kind, including\r\ngreat stores of pearls, were consumed, or meant to be. Of this, Mr.\r\nMoorehead says, in a letter to the author: “In the case of all altar\r\nofferings, a fire had been kindled ... and all these things were heaped\r\nupon it. They were utterly ruined, save a few; ... those at the top were\r\nnot so much affected as those at the bottom.”\r\n\r\nMr. Moorehead’s investigations already mentioned were in the years 1888\r\nto 1891 inclusive; he next took up especially the remarkable Hopewell\r\ngroups of mounds, in 1891–1892, and explored these extensively for the\r\narchæological exhibit at the World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893, at\r\nChicago.[554] This was his most important and elaborate investigation,\r\nand will be described in some detail. In 1896, he made a partial\r\nexploration of the Harness mound near Chillicothe, which has been fully\r\ncompleted more recently by Prof. William C. Mills, and will also be\r\ndescribed further on.\r\n\r\nThe investigations made in the Hopewell group of mounds were recorded by\r\nMr. Moorehead in a series of articles in the “Antiquarian.”[555] He\r\ngives a general account of the remarkable region of ancient remains in\r\nRoss County, Ohio. The State archæological map shows the “mound belt,”\r\nas a strip of country some fifteen miles wide and one hundred miles\r\nlong, extending through the Scioto Valley, from about Columbus to\r\nPortsmouth. The ancient works noted on this map, though not all that\r\nexist there, yet number over 900 mounds, 24 village sites, 36 circles of\r\nearth and stone, 87 other inclosures and works of similar character, and\r\n31 sites of gravel or kame burials. Five groups of mounds in particular\r\nexist in Ross County, all of them showing a “high culture” state. “All\r\nof the lower Scioto Valley,” says Mr. Moorehead, “was occupied by a\r\nmound-building tribe ranking higher in intelligence and numerically\r\nstronger than that of any other section of the whole Ohio region.” Among\r\nthe many remarkable ancient works in that part of the country, the five\r\ngroups in Ross County are the most important, and among these, the\r\nHopewell group is preëminent. The first published notice of them, which\r\nappeared in 1820, was by Mr. Caleb Atwater.[556] Squier and Davis\r\nexamined and described them in the years 1844–1846, and obtained large\r\nand notable collections from them which are now in England, in the\r\nBlackmore Museum at Salisbury, as not enough interest in such matters\r\nthen existed in America to induce the purchase and retention of these\r\nvaluable treasures. From that time until 1891, when Mr. Moorehead began\r\nhis explorations there, no one had paid much attention to these mounds,\r\nall published accounts being derived from those of Squier and Davis.\r\nThey described them under the name of Clark’s works, from the owner of\r\nthe farm within which they lie; but the property has since passed into\r\nthe possession of Mr. M. C. Hopewell. From this fact, yet more from his\r\nkind and intelligent interest in the work of exploration, his name has\r\nbeen given to the group.\r\n\r\nThe Hopewell works are situated on the north fork of Paint Creek, about\r\none third of a mile from the stream. The intervening space is low\r\nbottom-land, and the works stand upon a terrace about twenty feet high,\r\nfrom which again there is a rather steep rise of thirty or forty feet\r\nmore, to the general level of the country. They consist of a nearly\r\nquadrangular inclosure, about half a mile in length (strictly 2800\r\nfeet), and half as much in width, occupying the entire breadth of the\r\nterrace. At its eastern end, this large inclosure opens into a second\r\nand smaller one, an exact square of 850 feet. Within the main inclosure\r\nare one or more village sites, a number of separate mounds, and\r\nespecially a group of several connected elevations, together known as\r\nthe Effigy mound, these being much the highest and most conspicuous, and\r\nthemselves surrounded by a semicircular inclosure. The whole suggests a\r\ndefensive work, or “walled town”; but the wall, although strongly and\r\ncarefully built, partly of stones and partly of hard clay, is so\r\nlow—only from four to six feet in height—that it could not have been a\r\nvery formidable obstacle to a vigorous assault; and, moreover, the whole\r\nis overlooked and “commanded” from the bluff above it. The mounds, as\r\nSquier and Davis examined them, were pronounced to be mainly of the\r\nsacrificial or “altar” type. Since their very full and accurate account\r\nwas published, time and the hand of man have reduced and almost\r\nobliterated portions of the wall and some of the smaller mounds, while\r\nthe creek has slightly shifted its course. When they wrote their\r\ndescription, it was a little nearer than it is now; and they then\r\nexpressed the belief that it had formerly washed the base of the terrace\r\nwhere the works are located.\r\n\r\nMr. Moorehead’s exploring party, aided by Dr. H. T. Cresson, began\r\noperations at this notable group of mounds in August, 1891, and\r\ncontinued them through about seven months, without interruption, much of\r\nthe time in severe winter weather. The work was carried on under\r\nauthority of the Anthropological Department of the Columbian Exposition\r\nof 1893, at Chicago. All the most interesting and important of the very\r\nextensive body of relics obtained was displayed there; and the whole\r\nremains as a permanent exhibit in the Field (Columbian) Museum of\r\nNatural History.\r\n\r\nThe Hopewell group comprises in all some twenty larger and smaller\r\nmounds within the general inclosure, besides a few unimportant ones\r\noutside of it, and the main connected group in the special inclosure\r\nnear the center. These latter form together what is known as the Effigy\r\nmound, a name based upon its general resemblance to a reclining human\r\nfigure; but it is not constructed on a human or animal design, as are\r\nthe effigy mounds properly so called. After working for a time upon some\r\nof the others, and finding much interesting material, Mr. Moorehead set\r\nhis men to work upon the Effigy mound, and spent most of his time and\r\neffort upon that remarkable structure, of which he made a very thorough\r\nand systematic exploration.\r\n\r\nThe Effigy mound is about 500 feet long and 220 feet wide, and rises 23\r\nfeet above the general surface at its highest point. It proves to belong\r\nto the fourth class of Squier and Davis, those of mixed character, with\r\nboth altars and burials, as it contained three large altars and as many\r\nas 175 skeletons, nearly all of adults.\r\n\r\nReviewing now the entire exploration of the Hopewell group, the first\r\nmound opened, known as No. 17, was of considerable size, nearly ninety\r\nfeet in diameter, and was notable for a layer of mica—some 3000\r\nsheets—that extended almost entirely through it. It contained a rude\r\naltar, with ashes and bones, some copper implements, bone needles,\r\nsharks’ teeth, and nearly 200 pounds of bright galena. The next\r\nexamined, No. 18, contained several decayed skeletons, and a good\r\nexample of an “altar,” together with ornaments cut from human skulls.\r\nThe next, No. 19, had an altar of earth, partially hardened by heat,\r\nwhich was taken out entire and boxed. It was roughly cubical, about\r\nthree feet each way. In the “bowl,” or concavity, on the top of it, were\r\nvarious minor implements, with some galena and mica, etc. The next\r\nattacked was a large mound, No. 2, which had been partly opened by\r\nSquier and Davis, nearly fifty years before. It is remarkable for its\r\nimmense store of roughly chipped flint disks, over 8000 in number, of\r\nwhich 600 were taken out by Squier and Davis, and most of the remainder\r\nby Mr. Moorehead. It would seem to have been a place of storage for\r\npartly worked material of this kind, to preserve it from the hardening\r\neffect of long exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nSeveral other mounds yielded little of importance, save that from the\r\nsoil on the site of No. 1, which had been obliterated, were taken a\r\nnumber of fragments of bone, curiously ornamented with finely carved\r\npatterns. Two others, Nos. 4 and 5, had peculiarly constructed altars,\r\nof which an extended account is given.\r\n\r\nThe first discovery of pearls by Squier and Davis was made in their\r\nmound No. 9, now obliterated by a railroad. With the pearls, they report\r\nas found on the top of a small altar, broken instruments of obsidian,\r\ncut patterns of mica, vestiges of cloth, etc.\r\n\r\nMr. Moorehead’s first discovery of pearls was in a small but interesting\r\nmound, No. 20, about forty feet in diameter. It had been reduced by\r\nplowing to only some two feet in height; and its contents would ere long\r\nhave been broken into and scattered by the same process. This was\r\nstrictly a burial mound, and soon yielded five skeletons, one of them\r\nbeing that of a child, nine or ten years of age. With these bones were\r\nnumerous objects: two large shells made into cups for drinking, several\r\ncopper articles and ornaments, among them a broad copper bracelet\r\nencircling the right wrist, and several hundred pearl and shell beads\r\nand small shells. The same mound yielded later some other children’s\r\nremains, but with no important objects. A finely polished pipe and two\r\nbear’s teeth coated with copper were also found.\r\n\r\nMr. Moorehead points out the evidences of a long occupation of this site\r\nby a cultured tribe, who had commerce with the South and West more than\r\nwith the North or East.\r\n\r\nWork was then begun, in the latter part of September, on a large and\r\nimportant mound known as the Oblong (No. 23), 155 feet long by 100 feet\r\nwide, with an elevation at present of 14 feet, and originally of perhaps\r\n20 feet. This mound yielded thirty-nine skeletons, lying at depths\r\nvarying from eight and three fourths to eleven feet below the present\r\nsurface, nearly on the base-line of the mound. Some of these were\r\nsurrounded by boulders, others were much charred, and a good deal of\r\nvariety exists in their condition, all of which Mr. Moorehead describes\r\nparticularly. All manner of relics and objects were obtained, including\r\npearl beads and a splendid copper ax of seventeen pounds’ weight, of\r\ncourse entirely too large for any practical use, and hence plainly a\r\nceremonial object or badge of some high distinction. Among the most\r\nremarkable of the many interesting objects discovered here were the\r\nlarge canine teeth of bears,[557] which had not only been drilled\r\nthrough near the base of the root for suspension, like many others, but\r\nhad also been partly drilled at the middle of one side, and a large\r\npearl inserted into the cavity. These singular ornaments were found at\r\nthe neck of a skeleton, and had evidently been worn as pendants. It will\r\nbe remembered that almost identical specimens were found by Professor\r\nPutnam in the Marriott mound in the Miami Valley.[558] The one here\r\nfigured is now in the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, with\r\nmost of the other Hopewell material.\r\n\r\nAnother somewhat similar example of the taste and art of the same\r\npeople, also preserved in the Field Museum, came from the mound known as\r\nNo. 25. This consisted of a large figure of a bird, in hammered copper,\r\nfifteen and seven eighths inches long, with a pearl inserted to form the\r\neye. The head is quite expressive, and the tail-feathers well\r\nrepresented, although the wings and the general proportions are rude.\r\nThis is shown about one third of the actual length.\r\n\r\nThe Effigy mound was next examined. The first trial shafts proved it to\r\nbe evidently of human construction, and not of glacial origin, as some\r\nhad supposed. One or two open cuts were then begun, using teams with a\r\nlarge shovel until indications of burials were found, when the further\r\nwork would be carried on by hand, with extreme care.\r\n\r\nAfter about two weeks, in which time several skeletons were unearthed,\r\nwith some shells, beads, and copper ornaments, a burial of extraordinary\r\ncharacter was reached on November 14. Here was lying a skeleton which\r\nthe newspapers soon reported as “The King of the Mound-Builders.” It was\r\nmuch decayed, but was covered and surrounded with a wealth of relics.\r\nThe skull was surmounted by a tall cap or helmet of copper, from which\r\nextended a wonderful pair of antlers, exactly imitating those of a deer,\r\nbut made of wood and covered with copper. The whole skeleton, to quote\r\nthe words of Mr. Moorehead, “glittered with mica, pearl, shell, and\r\ncopper.” Plates of the latter were above, beneath, and around it, with\r\nbears’ and panthers’ teeth, etc., and over 1000 beads, many of them of\r\npearl. The succeeding month, during which the last cut was finished down\r\nto the base-line, and a third one much advanced, revealed numerous\r\nskeletons, with abundant objects of the same general kind, including a\r\nremarkable separate deposit of copper articles of curious workmanship,\r\nornaments of cut mica, and one of cannel coal, fragments of meteoric\r\niron and celts made therefrom, and “many thousand pearl and shell\r\nbeads.” The latest trophy here unearthed was another enormous ax of\r\ncopper, nearly two feet in length, unparalleled in the world.\r\n\r\nThe first altar was next reached; it was about four by five feet, and\r\nsome six inches deep, and had an immense variety of objects upon it and\r\naround it, nearly all entirely ruined by the fire. Among them were pearl\r\nbeads.\r\n\r\nThe largest altar had been not only heaped with all sorts of valuables,\r\nbut they had been piled around it so as to form a sloping mass of twelve\r\nfeet or more in diameter at the base. Among these was a layer of mica\r\nplates of extraordinary size, eighteen or twenty inches in diameter. It\r\nis not easy even now to obtain sheets of mica of such dimensions, in any\r\nquantity. Carvings and effigies in bone and slate, rock crystal\r\narrow-heads, obsidian knives, etc., etc., damaged and broken by heat,\r\nwere cemented together by half-melted copper. The pearl and shell beads\r\ntaken out amid the ashes are estimated at not less than 100,000.\r\n\r\nThe Effigy mound, “a place for ceremony, for sacrifice, for burial,” as\r\nMr. Moorehead calls it, thus combining the character of the first three\r\nclasses distinguished by Squier and Davis, is seen not to have been\r\nconstructed at one time, but to have developed gradually through perhaps\r\na long period. The several altars, the more important burials, the store\r\nof copper objects, each was surmounted by a small and separate mound.\r\n“These may have been built on the level dance or ceremonial floors, from\r\ntime to time. When the entire floor was covered, the people brought\r\nlarge quantities of earth and gravel, heaped it on top of the irregular\r\ncontour of the small mounds, and this formed the present Effigy.”\r\n\r\nThe population that occupied the main inclosure was apparently not very\r\nlarge, as compared with some other of the important earthworks, such as\r\nFort Ancient, or Madisonville. From the distribution of village-site\r\ndebris, Mr. Moorehead estimates that there could have been only from two\r\nhundred to three hundred lodges, even if these were all occupied at the\r\nsame time. But the indications of traffic and of art show that it must\r\nhave been a community advanced in culture beyond most of its neighbors.\r\nMr. Moorehead believes it to have been a sort of capital among a body of\r\nallied or affiliated tribes who made and occupied the similar earthwork\r\ntowns of the “mound belt,”—a center of production and distribution of\r\nart objects, and a place for the holding of great religious ceremonials.\r\nIt may be noted, however, that the art was developed in certain\r\ndirections and not in others wherein it might be expected. In hammered\r\ncopper-work and in drilling, it was most remarkable, in the latter\r\nextending even to the perforation of quartz crystals, but of pottery\r\nthere is little, and that not very choice—a striking contrast to the\r\nabundant and elaborately ornamental potter’s art of the tribes in the\r\nSouthwest.\r\n\r\nTonti, the historian of La Salle’s expedition, in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, states that La Salle actually saw mound-dwellers among southern\r\ntribes of Indians, living very much as the Ohio mound-builders must have\r\ndone, and quite untouched as yet by any contact with the whites. Tonti\r\ndescribes the dwellings, made of sun-dried mud and with dome-shaped\r\nroofs of cane; two of them were larger and better constructed than the\r\nrest, one the chief’s house and the other a temple, both about forty\r\nfeet square. The latter held the bones of deceased chieftains, and was\r\nsurmounted by three rude, wooden eagles. In the center was apparently “a\r\nkind of altar,” where was maintained a perpetual fire of logs, watched\r\nby two aged men. A recess, to which strangers were not admitted,\r\ncontained the treasures of the tribe, especially pearls from the Gulf,\r\nas he was told. The chief returned the visit of La Salle, coming in\r\ngreat state, with attendants, one of whom bore a disk of copper,\r\nsupposed to represent the sun, the chief’s great ancestor.[559] The\r\nwooden eagles recall the large copper bird taken from mound No. 25 at\r\nHopewell; and the copper disk carried before the chief suggests a\r\nsimilar use for some of the large objects of the same metal. The whole\r\naccount is extremely interesting in its resemblance to the Ohio remains.\r\n\r\nThe most complete study of these ancient structures is that of the\r\nHarness mound, not far distant from the Hopewell, conducted under the\r\ndirection of the Ohio State Archæological and Historical Society, in\r\n1905, by their curator and librarian, Prof. William C. Mills.[560]\r\n\r\nThe Harness group contains within and about it fourteen mounds; the\r\nworks as a whole were described by Squier and Davis, on page 56 of their\r\ngreat report (“Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley,” 1848), and\r\nhave been frequently mentioned and pictured for their striking form,—a\r\nlarge and perfect circle, opening at one side into a smaller circle and\r\nalso into an exact square. They are located, like the Hopewell, in Ross\r\nCounty, and stand on a terrace of the Scioto River, nearly a mile from\r\nits eastern bank, and about eight miles south of Chillicothe.\r\n\r\nThe square inclosure measures 1080 feet on each side, and the diameters\r\nof the two circles are about 1600 feet for the larger and 650 feet for\r\nthe smaller. In general character, this group closely resembles the\r\nHopewell: there is the same low wall or embankment, some four feet high,\r\nthough without any ditch as at Hopewell, and the same problem as to its\r\nobject. A number of small mounds are placed here and there, and one\r\nlarge and important one recalls the Effigy, though it is somewhat less\r\nin size and much more regular in form. In 1846, when Squier and Davis\r\nexamined it, unfortunately most of the ground was covered with woods;\r\nbut these are gone, and the works have since been much reduced by\r\ntillage and partly obliterated by railroad and other constructions.\r\n\r\nThe one large mound is named for the recent owner of the property, Mr.\r\nEdwin Harness; the present owner, his son, Mr. John M. Harness, aided\r\nand facilitated the explorations in every way. This fact, as also in the\r\ncase of Mr. Hopewell, stands in pleasing and honorable contrast to the\r\nnarrow policy of some land-owners, who refuse permission for any such\r\nwork, even when the structures are upon unused and valueless ground.\r\n\r\nThe large mound is an almost perfect oval in form, 160 feet long and\r\nsome 80 feet across at its widest point, which is about one third of the\r\nway from the northern end; in height it is nearly 20 feet, or was before\r\nits recent removal. It was partly explored by Squier and Davis in 1846,\r\nand quite extensively by Professor Putnam in 1885, and, unlike the\r\nEffigy mound, had been repeatedly opened and examined in a small way by\r\nboth official and unofficial explorers. In 1896, Mr. W. K. Moorehead\r\ntook up the work where Professor Putnam had stopped, and carried it\r\nconsiderably further, under the auspices of the Ohio Archæological and\r\nHistorical Society; and the same body, in 1905, commissioned Mr. Mills\r\nto resume and complete the examination, removing the entire structure\r\ndown to its base.\r\n\r\nThe Harness mound, unlike the Effigy, was for burial purposes only.\r\nThere must have been nearly two hundred. Squier and Davis found one of\r\nthese, and possibly another which they mistook for an “altar”; and they\r\nstate their belief that the mound probably contained other burials which\r\ntheir two pits had not revealed. Professor Putnam encountered 12\r\nburials, Mr. Moorehead 27, and the final exploration 133, making a total\r\nof 174. Besides these, an unknown number have been disturbed and removed\r\nby occasional explorers. Of the 174 recorded, only ten had been buried\r\nwithout being burned; the rest were all cremated, some where they were\r\nlaid, but most of them elsewhere, and the ashes brought and placed in\r\nthe grave. This was in all cases carefully prepared, within a small\r\ninclosure of logs, the decayed and charred remains of which are clearly\r\ntraceable. The entire mound itself had been outlined with posts set in\r\nthe ground. the holes and impressions remaining as evidence of the fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Mills outlines the history of this mound, in a way that recalls Mr.\r\nMoorehead’s views as to the gradual growth of the Effigy. It began as a\r\nplace for the holding of funeral rites and the deposit of the dead,\r\nmarked out by lines of posts, which show that it was from time to time\r\nenlarged. Finally, when the place was substantially filled, earth and\r\ngravel were deposited over the whole, and slabs of stone (particularly\r\nnoted by Squier and Davis) were laid around it, upon the lower part of\r\nthe slope.\r\n\r\nMuch description is given of the separate graves or burial chambers,\r\nwhich are of several types, and of the various details of the cremated\r\nand uncremated interments. The mound is rich in relics, although none of\r\nthe profuse sacrificial accumulations of the “altars” were encountered,\r\nthis being a mound of burial only. The relics are of the same kind, in\r\ngeneral, as those found in the Hopewell group, and to specify them in\r\ndetail would be only repetition. From the 133 graves opened in Mr.\r\nMills’s final investigation, no less than 1200 specimens were obtained\r\nfor the museum of the Archæological Society at Columbus. Among these\r\nwere artefacts of Lake Superior copper (and some pieces of native\r\nsilver), large shells from the Gulf, galena, obsidian, and much mica,\r\nboth in “blocks” and cut into ornaments, all showing the same range of\r\naboriginal commerce as already described at Hopewell. In reference to\r\npearls, the following are the principal observations:\r\n\r\nBeads made from Unio pearls were very abundant everywhere in the Harness\r\nmound, as also beads of shell. They are found in such position as to\r\nshow that they were strung and worn around the neck or wrists. One\r\nburial (No. 100) had some 2100 pearl beads, all rather small, and some\r\nof them perfectly round. Several hundred were obtained, however, that\r\nranged from one quarter to one half an inch in diameter. A number of\r\nthese are shown of natural size. The larger pearls, instead of being\r\nbored through for beads, are frequently somewhat flattened by grinding,\r\nand then pierced with two holes so as to attach them to a fabric. Very\r\nlarge ones were sometimes set in copper,—a style of work never observed\r\nbefore. Mr. Mills says of this: “Large and select pearls were flattened\r\nupon one side by grinding, and then placed upon a circular disk of\r\ncopper a little larger than the pearl. The edges were then turned (up)\r\naround the pearl, holding it in place. Not only were pearls set in this\r\nway, but various pieces of shell cut in a circular form.” Fine examples\r\nof this unique style of jewelry, of natural size, and another copper\r\nsetting of like character, from which the pearl has been lost, are shown\r\nin plates facing pages 499 and 510.\r\n\r\nMore curious still is the discovery of imitation pearls, made of clay,\r\nand apparently modeled from real ones as they reproduce all the\r\nirregularities of form of the true pearls. They could easily have been\r\nmade more nearly spherical, as the beads cut from shell are so regular\r\nas to look as though made by machinery. These somewhat irregular clay\r\nimitations, found with the genuine pearls, were first coated with a\r\npulverent mica and then burned so as to preserve a pearly appearance.\r\n\r\nOther forms of art work were abundantly represented in the Harness\r\nmound, such as carvings and decorations in stone and bone; a variety of\r\ntextile fabrics, of which remnants are preserved when they were in\r\ncontact with plates of copper, the salts of the metal having penetrated\r\nthe fabric and prevented its entire decay; very skilful work in copper,\r\nand to some extent in native silver and meteoric iron; and numerous\r\nfragments of pottery, more or less ornamental with simple impressed\r\npatterns. The “culture,” as a whole, appears to have been equal, and\r\nvery similar, to that of the Hopewell community, and these are regarded\r\nas having been the most advanced among the Ohio mound-builders; while\r\nthe term “Fort Ancient culture” is applied to a somewhat lower grade in\r\nthe matter of arts, which has its chief illustration among the builders\r\nand occupants of that celebrated work. By such researches, thus minutely\r\nand systematically conducted, there is now beginning to be possible\r\nsomething like a classification of these ancient unknown tribes, which\r\nwill doubtless be developed more fully, as investigation shall be\r\nextended and its results combined and compared.\r\n\r\nAs to pearls in the mounds of Illinois, we are informed by the veteran\r\narchæologist, Dr. J. F. Snyder, that in 1889 he found the skeletons of\r\nthree adult Indians at the base of a small mound on the bluffs of the\r\nSangomon River in Cass County. These skeletons were in a squatting\r\nposture; artefacts—such as greenstone celts, a bicave stone and a heavy\r\npipe—had only been deposited with one of them. Around each wrist and\r\nankle of this skeleton were perforated beads made from _Marginella_\r\nshells, and resting on the sternum was a solitary pearl which had\r\nevidently formed the center of a necklace of the same small marine\r\nshells. Although much decayed, it still retained something of its\r\noriginal luster. It was spherical, measured approximately seven eighths\r\nof an inch in diameter, and was perforated through the middle. Dr.\r\nSnyder also states that at the base of one of the large mounds he opened\r\nin 1895, in Brown County, on the west side of the Illinois River, he\r\ndiscovered a number of the large canine teeth of the bear, perforated at\r\nthe roots, so as to be used for necklaces. On the convex side of each\r\ntooth were from two to four pits about one third of an inch in diameter,\r\nand the same in depth, in which gems had been inserted. Two small pearls\r\nwere still in place. Near by were the remains of another necklace\r\ncomposed of alternate pearls and bone beads; the latter were oblong and\r\nperforated lengthwise. Eight of the pearls were recovered, ranging in\r\ndiameter from one half to one third of an inch, and pierced through the\r\ncenter, but all were very badly injured by the action of fire.\r\n\r\nMr. David I. Bushnell, who has excavated the McEvers mound in Montezuma,\r\nPike County, Illinois, for the Missouri Historical Society, found in\r\nthis mound a cyst containing a skeleton six feet in height and also a\r\nskull reposing on a bundle of bones near which lay forty-five pearls,\r\none of them weighing fifty-two grains and still showing a beautiful\r\nluster. Almost all the objects discovered in the mound will be presented\r\nto the Missouri Historical Society. The large pearl would be worth from\r\n$12,000 to $15,000 if it were in perfect condition.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Mr. Richard Herrmann, founder of the Herrmann Museum of\r\nNatural History, Dubuque, Iowa, that on the top of the high cliff from\r\nEagle’s Point to its end at McKnight’s Spring, there were formerly a\r\ngreat many mounds which were long ago examined by government experts.\r\nMany ancient ornaments were found in these mounds, among them a string\r\nof pearls, greatly damaged from having been buried for a long\r\nperiod.[561] Mr. Herrmann believes that these pearls were taken from the\r\nMississippi River by the mound-builders.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said, in this general sketch, to give some idea of the\r\nextent to which pearls, largely those from the fresh-water Unios, were\r\ngathered and used by the native tribes of North America, from the\r\nancient mound-builders of the Ohio Valley to the Indians encountered by\r\nthe explorers and colonists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nThe love of pearls shown by the Indians was as noteworthy as was their\r\ndevotion to their dead and the superstitious mystery which enshrouds\r\ntheir funeral rites; for, when the human sacrifice was consummated, the\r\nact was performed in as earnest a spirit of devotion as was shown by\r\nAbraham in his readiness to sacrifice Isaac, and the Indians evidenced\r\nan almost pathetic sentiment either of reverence, duty, or supernatural\r\ndread.\r\n\r\nDr. J. Walter Fewkes writes that in none of his excavations has he ever\r\nnoted pearls. Haliotis shells, conch shells, and fragments of the same\r\nhave been found in the great ruins at Casa Grande, Arizona.\r\n\r\nDr. Charles Hercules Read, director of the Department of Archæology of\r\nthe British Museum, states that the Mexican mosaic masks in the Christy\r\ncollection, which are pre-Columbian in origin, and probably date\r\nhundreds of years in advance of the conquest, prove of special interest\r\nfrom the fact that five of them contain an inlay of mother-of-pearl\r\nshell. The first of these is a plain mask in which the eyes are of\r\nmother-of-pearl; the second is a dagger having the details of\r\nfeather-work in mother-of-pearl; the third, a circular shield center\r\nhaving the eyes, teeth, fingers, and toes of the figures in\r\nmother-of-pearl; the fourth, a helmet with small pieces of pearl-shell\r\nrepresenting collars around the necks of rattlesnakes; and the fifth is\r\na jaguar in the side of which are similar inlays. These masks are\r\ndescribed by Dr. Read in “Archæologia,” Society of Antiquaries, London,\r\nVol. LIV, p. 383; in this volume the objects are shown in color. Dr.\r\nRead communicates that the pearl jaguar seems to be of more recent\r\nexecution, but he believes the first four to be original. He is not\r\nentirely sure that these objects contain the true mother-of-pearl, the\r\nsubstance having changed so much as to make a decision doubtful even if\r\nit were extracted. He states, however, that it is a pearly, nacreous\r\nshell, resembling that of the ordinary pearl-oyster. In these masks are\r\nalso other shells, among them a red shell, probably a spondylus, almost\r\nas red as coral. The mother-of-pearl is of special interest as it is\r\nquite possible that the shell itself was known, and it may be that\r\npearls also formed part of a commerce that existed between the coast and\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Group of charred, cut fresh-water pearls; more than 100,000 found in\r\n    mounds\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Finger-shaped piece of lignite inlaid with fresh-water pearl\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Copper bird, 15⅞ inches long with eye of fresh-water pearl\r\n]\r\n\r\n  FRESH-WATER PEARLS FROM HOPEWELL GROUP OF MOUNDS, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO\r\n\r\nWe are informed by Mr. E. P. Dieseldorf, of Coban, Republic of\r\nGuatemala, that he has never observed pearls in the pre-Columbian graves\r\nin Guatemala; he had, however, frequently found marine shells, whole,\r\nand elaborated in connection with jadeite beads.\r\n\r\nIn a personal communication, Mr. Thomas Gann, of Yucatan, states that,\r\nin excavating a mound at San Antonio, near the mouth of the Rio Hondo,\r\nin Yucatan, he uncovered a small stone cyst or chamber, containing two\r\nperforated, pear-like ornaments of considerable size, together with\r\nportions of a human skeleton, painted pottery, etc. He also states that\r\nornaments such as beads, gorgets, and ear-pendants, made from the pearly\r\nshell of both the oyster and the conch, are of common occurrence in many\r\nsepulchral mounds in British Honduras and in Yucatan, and he notes the\r\nfact that pink conch pearls are found in considerable numbers at the\r\npresent day along the coast of British Honduras. There is no especial\r\nfishing for pearls, and they are found only incidentally in conchs which\r\nhave been gathered for food. These pearls are sold by fishermen in\r\nBalize at prices varying from two or three dollars to twenty or thirty\r\napiece. In size they range from that of a large pin’s head to that of a\r\nsmall pea.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marie Robinson Wright informs us that she has never found pearls in\r\nthe Bolivian graves, although they are quite plentiful in Bolivia\r\nto-day, and hundreds of them are offered in the markets. The pretty\r\ngirls wear them as earrings and in their _topos_.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that pearls existed long before the advent of man,\r\nboth in the fresh-water and in the marine form. This is more clearly\r\nevidenced by Sir Charles Lyell, who calls attention to the fact that the\r\nfresh-water mussel (_Unio littoralis Gray_), formerly found in abundance\r\nat Grays Thurrock, Essex, no longer exists in England, but occurs in\r\nFrance, showing that not only had this mollusk been unseen by any\r\nEnglishman, but that the form had become extinct in an entire country.\r\nThus, both the pearl shell of the ocean and the pearl-mussel of the\r\nriver, for many centuries produced pearls, which passed away with the\r\nshell itself.\r\n\r\nA great number of fossil Unios were collected by Barnum Brown from the\r\nLaramie clays, 130 miles northwest of Miles City, Montana. The shells\r\nwere found in a bed situated about 180 feet above the Fort Pierre shales\r\nand, therefore, well above the recognized cretaceous strata. These\r\nshells were in fairly good condition and retained the nacreous coloring\r\nto a considerable extent. As some of them resemble the modern species,\r\nit seems that the same designations might be applied to them.\r\n\r\nProf. R. P. Whitfield, one of our greatest palæontologists, who has\r\ncarefully examined these fossil shells, suggests that they are probably\r\nthe progenitors of the species of Unios and fresh-water mussels that now\r\ninhabit the Mississippi and Wisconsin rivers and their tributaries, and\r\nhe proposes the following names for some of them, indicating at the same\r\ntime the living species with which he compares them: _Unio biæsopoides_,\r\n_Unio æsopoides_ and _Unio æsopiformis_, all resembling _U. æsopus_\r\nGreen; _Unio letsoni_ = _U. cornutus_ Barnes; _Unio cylindricoides_ =\r\n_U. cylindricus_ Say; _Unio gibbosoides_ = _U. gibbosus_ Barnes; _Unio\r\npyramidatoides_ = _U. pyramidatus_ Lea; _Unio retusoides_ = _U. retusus_\r\nLam.; _Unio verucosiformis_ = _U. verrucosus_ Barnes.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is almost certain that these ancient Unios were\r\npearl-bearing, Professor Whitfield informs us that, in a period of fifty\r\nyears of palæontological research, he has never found a fossil pearl.\r\n\r\nWe are informed by Sophus Müller, Director of the Royal Danish Museum of\r\nAntiquities at Copenhagen, that no Danish ornaments containing pearls\r\nhave been found dating from an earlier period than 1000 B.C.; he also\r\nstates that no fresh-water pearls have ever been discovered in the\r\nDanish graves.\r\n\r\nDr. H. Ulmann, director of the great Swiss Landesmuseum at Zurich, and\r\nDr. Otto Leiner, director of the Rosengarten Museum at Constance,\r\npersonally communicated to us that no pearls exist in either of the\r\ncollections of these great museums, nor to their knowledge have any been\r\ndiscovered in the lake-dwellings or the prehistoric graves of either\r\nSwitzerland or Baden. This may either be due to conditions favorable to\r\nthe dissolution of the pearl by the action of the ooze on the lake\r\nbottom, or else to the entire absence of knowledge of them on the part\r\nof a people who were familiar with many materials, since the museum\r\ncollections even show jade implements of a number of types.\r\n\r\nDr. Leiner, whose father was curator of the Rosengarten Museum before\r\nhim, informs us that at Bodman on Lake Constance there were found a\r\nlarge number of bored cylinders, from one fourth of an inch to one inch\r\nin length, made out of limestone. They were used for necklaces, somewhat\r\nin the style of our Indian wampum, and were either worn alone or in\r\nconnection with bored cylinders made of the tuff-rock and also of\r\nencrinite stems.\r\n\r\nDr. Leiner also asserts that he has never seen _Unio margaritifera_ in\r\nLake Constance; nor was there any evidence of shells, broken or\r\notherwise, observed by him in the excavations in the lake-dwellings.\r\n\r\nThe curator of the Rhodesia Museum, Bulawayo, South Africa, states that\r\nin Rhodesia, in the vicinity of Bulawayo, beads made out of the shell of\r\nthe common Unio or fresh-water mussel (_Unio verreauxi_) have been\r\nobserved in the graves, although pearls themselves have never been found\r\nwith them in any burials.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ADDENDA\r\n\r\n  One of the authors used every endeavor in 1893 and 1894 to have a\r\n  bill passed by Congress for the regulation of pearl-fishing in the\r\n  United States. These efforts were frustrated by the influence of the\r\n  local pearl fishers. An attempt has now been made to preserve the\r\n  industry in Illinois, where the legislature has this spring passed a\r\n  bill for its regulation.\r\n\r\n  The first section of the bill provides:\r\n\r\n  It shall be unlawful for any person or persons to take or catch, by\r\n  any means whatever, in any of the navigable waters within the\r\n  jurisdiction of this State, any mussel, fresh-water clam or\r\n  shell-fish from the first day of October to the first day of April\r\n  (both dates inclusive) of each succeeding year.\r\n\r\nThe bill imposes upon any one who violates these provisions a fine of\r\nnot less than $25, nor more than $100, or imprisonment in the county\r\njail for a term not exceeding one year, or else both fine and\r\nimprisonment at the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\nAnother section provides that any one not a resident of Illinois, who\r\ntakes clams, shell-fish, or mussels, without procuring a license, shall\r\nbe subject to a fine of not less than $50, nor more than $100, or to\r\nimprisonment for one year, or to both penalties. The licenses may be\r\nprocured on application and payment of $50 for each vessel to be\r\nemployed, and they expire on the first day of October following their\r\nissuance. The amount received for these licenses is to be turned over to\r\nthe State Treasurer at the end of each month and placed to the credit of\r\nthe State Fish Protective Fund. No boat having more than two bars, each\r\nnot exceeding sixteen feet in length, shall be used for this fishery,\r\nand the space separating the hooks on these bars is not to be less than\r\neight inches.\r\n\r\nMiss Carl, the artist who painted the portraits of the Empress and that\r\nof the Dowager Empress of China, states that she wears a diamond ring.\r\nWhen she shows this she apologizes for wearing it, stating that it had\r\nbeen given to her by the Viceroy, Li Hung Chang, saying that she,\r\nherself, sees no beauty in the sparkle of the diamond; for her there is\r\nmore beauty in the soft, quiet tones of the pearl than in the brilliancy\r\nof the diamond.\r\n\r\nDuring the Boxer War in China, the looting was carried on to so great an\r\nextent, that a French hotel-keeper is said to have obtained a basket of\r\npearls, which he bought for a trifle, and which are said to have netted\r\nhim very nearly $1,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BIBLIOGRAPHY[562]\r\n\r\n\r\nALBERTUS MAGNUS, _Bishop of Ratisbon_\r\n\r\n  Le libro de le pietre preciose e de le loro u(ir)tude (Old Italian\r\n  version of the De lapidibus). 14th century MS., vellum, 44ff. 4to.
