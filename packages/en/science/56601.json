Each may, therefore, find some superfluous matter, for\r\nwhich his indulgence is asked. The book is an expansion of a short\r\narticle which appeared in Spons' 'Encyclopædia of the Industrial Arts,'\r\nand to some extent still bears traces of its origin; and, having been\r\nwritten under stress of limited leisure, and defective eyesight, is\r\nvery far from being so perfect as I should desire. For the sake of\r\ncompleteness it has been necessary to describe many processes which are\r\noutside the range of my own manufacturing experience, and in doing so\r\nI have generally referred to the sources of my information. Chapters\r\nIII. and XXIV. are written by Mr. C. G. Warnford Lock, to whose kind\r\nassistance I am much indebted. It may be well to state in conclusion,\r\nthat while the work is not intended for a cram-book for technical\r\nstudents, it is hoped that it may be an assistance to teachers of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n                                                      HENRY R.

This\r\ndemands thorough explanation, in both its practical and theoretical\r\naspects, not only because it is one of the most important branches of\r\nthe trade, but because the principles involved are those which equally\r\nunderlie all other tanning methods. The next to be dealt with will\r\nbe the modifications of the process which are necessary in tanning\r\nthe more flexible leathers used for boot-uppers, hose-pipes, and\r\nsaddlery purposes; then the currying of these leathers; and finally,\r\nthe manufacture of moroccos, Russian, and japanned leathers, calf- and\r\nglove-kid, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nANATOMICAL STRUCTURE OF HIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of actual processes of manufacture, it is necessary to\r\ndevote some attention to the structure and chemical constitution of\r\nhide or skin, which forms the raw material. Although a great variety\r\nof skins are employed in tanning, they are all constituted on the same\r\ngeneral type, and an anatomical description of the hide of the ox will\r\napply almost equally to those of the calf, sheep, and goat; but from\r\ndifferences in thickness and closeness of texture, their practical uses\r\ndiffer widely. Fig. 1 shows a section of ox-hide, cut parallel with the\r\nhair, magnified about 50 diam.: _a_, epithelial layer or _epidermis_,\r\nconsisting of horny layer above, and _rete malpighi_ below; _b_, _pars\r\npapillaris_, and _c_, _pars reticularis_ of _corium_, _derma_, or true\r\nskin; _d_, hairs; _e_, sebaceous or fat-glands; _f_, sudoriferous or\r\nsweat-glands; _g_, opening of ducts of sweat-glands; _h_, _erectores\r\npili_ muscles, for erecting the hair.\r\n\r\nThe fresh hide consists of 2 layers: an outer, the epidermis; and an\r\ninner, the true skin. The epidermis is very thin as compared with the\r\ntrue skin which it covers, and is entirely removed preparatory to\r\ntanning; it nevertheless possesses important functions. It is shown in\r\nFig. 1 at _a_, and more highly magnified in Fig. 2. Its inner mucous\r\nlayer _b_, the _rete malpighi_, which rests upon the true skin _c_, is\r\nsoft, and composed of living nucleated cells, which are elongated in\r\nthe deeper layers, and gradually become flattened as they approach the\r\nsurface, where they dry up, and form the horny layer _a_. This last\r\nis being constantly worn away, and thrown off as dead scales of skin;\r\nand as constantly renewed from below, by the continued multiplication\r\nof the cells. It is from this epithelial layer that the hair, as well\r\nas the sweat- and fat-glands, are developed. It will be seen in Fig. 1\r\nthat each hair is surrounded by a sheath, which is continuous with the\r\nepidermis. In embryonic development, a small knob of cells forms on the\r\nunder side of the epidermis, and this enlarges, and sinks deeper into\r\nthe true skin, while the root of the young hair is formed within it;\r\nthis is shown in Fig. 3, _a b_. Smaller projections also form on the\r\nstalk of the knob, and in due time produce the sebaceous glands. The\r\nprocess of development of the sudoriferous glands is very similar to\r\nthat of the hairs. There is a great analogy between this process and\r\nthat of the ordinary renewal of hair in the adult animal. At _d_^1\r\nFig. 1, is seen an old and worn-out hair. It is shrunken and elongated,\r\nand is almost ready to fall out. It will be noticed that its sheath or\r\nfollicle projects somewhat below the hair to the right. This is the\r\nfirst production of a young hair, and is quite analogous to the knob of\r\nepithelium which has been described as forming the starting-point of a\r\nhair in embryo. At _d_^2, the same process is seen further advanced,\r\nthe young hair being already formed, and growing up into the old\r\nsheath. At _d_^3, it is complete, the old hair having fallen out, and\r\nthe young one having taken its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe hair itself is covered with a layer of overlapping scales, like\r\nthe slates on a roof, but of irregular form. These give it a serrated\r\noutline at the sides, strongly developed in wool. Within these scales,\r\nwhich are sometimes called the \"hair cuticle,\" is a fibrous substance,\r\nwhich forms the body of the hair; and sometimes, but not always, there\r\nis also a central and cellular pith, which is mostly transparent,\r\nthough under the microscope it frequently appears black and opaque,\r\nfrom the optical effect of imprisoned air. On boiling or long soaking\r\nin water, alcohol, or turpentine, these air-spaces become saturated\r\nwith the liquid, and then appear transparent.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous part of the hair is made up of long spindle-shaped cells,\r\nand contains the pigment which gives the hair its colour. The hair\r\nof the deer differs from that of most other animals in being almost\r\nwholly formed of polygonal cells, which, in white hairs, are usually\r\nfilled with air. At its base, the hair swells into a bulb, which is\r\nhollow, and rests on a sort of projecting knob of the _corium_, called\r\nthe hair-papilla. This has blood-vessels and nerves, and supplies\r\nnourishment to the hair. The hair-bulb is composed of round, soft\r\ncells, which multiply rapidly; as they grow, they press upward through\r\nthe hair-sheath, become elongated and hardened, and form the hair. In\r\ndark hairs, both the cells of the hair itself and those of its follicle\r\nor sheath are strongly pigmented, but the hair much the more so, and\r\nhence the bulb has usually a distinct dark form. The dark-haired\r\nportions of a hide from which the hair has been removed by liming\r\nstill remain coloured, from the pigmented cells of the hair-sheaths,\r\nwhich can only be got out completely by bating and scudding. The\r\ncells outside the bulb, shown at _f_, in Fig. 4, pass upwards as they\r\ngrow, and form a distinct coating around the hair, which is called\r\nthe \"inner root-sheath.\" This again consists of 2 separate layers,\r\nof which the inner is \"Huxley's,\" the outer, \"Henle's.\" They arise\r\nfrom the same cells in the base of the hair; but in the inner layer,\r\nthese remain polygonal and nucleated, while in the outer, they become\r\nspindle-shaped and without nuclei. The inner root-sheath does not\r\nextend to the surface of the skin, but dies away below the sebaceous\r\nglands. This figure represents an ox-hair root, mag. 200 diam.: _a_,\r\nfibrous substance of hair; _b_, hair cuticle; _c_, inner root-sheath;\r\n_d_, outer root-sheath; _e_, dermic coat of hair-sheath; _f_, origin of\r\ninner sheath; _g_, bulb; _h_, papilla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\nOutside the inner root-sheath is a layer of nucleated cells, continuous\r\nwith those of the epidermis, and of the same character. This is the\r\n\"outer root-sheath,\" and is shown at _d_, Fig. 4. This, together with\r\nthe whole of the epidermis, is covered next the _corium_ with an\r\nexceedingly fine membrane, called the \"hyaline\" or glassy layer. It\r\nis possible that this forms the very thin buff-coloured \"grain\" of\r\ntanned leather, which evidently is of different structure from the rest\r\nof the _corium_, since, if it gets scraped off before tanning, the\r\nexposed portion of the _pars papillaris_ remains nearly white, instead\r\nof colouring. The whole of the hair-sheath is enclosed in a coating of\r\nelastic and connective-tissue fibres, which are supplied with nerves\r\nand blood-vessels, and form part of the _corium_. Near the opening of\r\nthe hair-sheaths to the surface of the skin, the ducts of the sebaceous\r\nor fat-glands (_e_, Fig. 1), pass into them, and secrete a sort of\r\noil to lubricate the hair. The glands themselves are formed of large\r\nnucleated cells, arranged somewhat like a bunch of grapes; one is shown\r\nhighly magnified in Fig. 5: _a_, sebaceous gland; _b_, hair-stem; _c_,\r\npart of _erector pili_ muscle. The upper and more central cells are\r\nmost highly charged with fat, which is shown by the darker shading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\nAs already remarked, the sudoriferous or sweat-glands are also derived\r\nfrom the epidermis layer. They are shown at _f_, Fig. 1, and on a\r\nlarger scale (200 diam.) in Fig. 6: _a_, windings laid open in making\r\nsection; they consist, in the ox and sheep, of a large wide tube,\r\nsometimes slightly twisted. In this, they differ considerably from\r\nthose of man, which form a spherical knot of extremely convoluted\r\ntube. The walls of these glands are formed of longitudinal fibres of\r\nconnective tissue of the _corium_, lined with a single layer of large\r\nnucleated cells, which secrete the perspiration. The ducts, which are\r\nexceedingly narrow, and with walls of nucleated cells like those of\r\nthe outer hair-sheaths, sometimes open directly through the epidermis,\r\nas shown at _g_, Fig. 1, but more frequently into the orifice of a\r\nhair-sheath, just at the surface of the skin. Each hair is provided\r\nwith a slanting muscle (_h_, Fig. 1), called the _arrector_ or _erector\r\npili_, which is contracted by cold or fear, and causes the hair to\r\n\"bristle,\" or stand on end; by forcing up the attached skin, it\r\nproduces the effect known as \"goose-skin.\" The muscle, which is of the\r\nunstriped or involuntary kind, passes from near the hair-bulb to the\r\nepidermis, and just under the sebaceous glands, which it compresses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe _corium_ or true skin is principally composed of interlacing\r\nbundles of white fibres, of the kind known as \"connective tissue\";\r\nthese are composed of fibrils of extreme fineness, cemented together\r\nby a substance of different composition from the fibres themselves.\r\nThis may be demonstrated by steeping a small piece of hide for some\r\ndays in a stoppered bottle in lime-, or baryta-water, in which the\r\ninter-fibrillar substance is soluble, and then teasing a small fragment\r\nof the fibre with needles on a glass microscope-slide, and examining\r\nwith a power of at least 200-300 diam. In the middle portion of the\r\nskin, these bundles of fibre are closely interwoven; but next the\r\nbody, they gradually become looser and more open, forming the _pars\r\nreticularis_ (or netted part); and the innermost layer is a mere\r\nnetwork of loose membrane, generally loaded with masses of fat-cells,\r\nand hence called adipose tissue.\r\n\r\nIt is this adipose tissue which is removed in the \"fleshing\" process.\r\nOn the other hand, the outermost layer, just beneath the epidermis,\r\nis exceedingly close and compact, the fibre-bundles that run into it\r\nbeing separated into their elementary fibrils, which are so interlaced\r\nthat they can scarcely be recognised. This is the _pars papillaris_,\r\nand forms the lighter-coloured layer, called (together with its very\r\nfine outer coating) the \"grain\" of leather. It is in this part that the\r\nfat-glands are embedded, while the hair-roots and sweat-glands pass\r\nthrough it into the looser tissue beneath.\r\n\r\nBesides the connective-tissue fibres, the skin contains a small\r\nproportion of fine yellow fibres, called \"elastic\" fibres. If a thin\r\nsection of hide be soaked for a few minutes in strong acetic acid, and\r\nthen examined under the microscope, the white connective-tissue fibres\r\nbecome swollen and transparent, and the yellow fibres may then be seen,\r\nas they are scarcely affected by the acid. The hair-bulbs and sweat-\r\nand fat-glands are also rendered distinctly visible.\r\n\r\nThe nerves of the skin are very numerous, each hair being supplied\r\nwith fibres passing into both the papilla and sheath. They also\r\npass into the skin papillæ. They cannot readily be seen, without\r\nspecial preparation, and, so far as is known, exercise no influence\r\non the tanning process. \"Breaking the nerve\" is a technical term,\r\nwhich signifies a thorough stretching and softening of the skin, but\r\nhas nothing to do with nerves properly so called. The blood- and\r\nlymph-vessels are, from the present point of view, somewhat more\r\nimportant. They may often be seen in sections, and are lined with\r\nnucleated cells, similar to those of the glands. These are surrounded\r\nby coatings of unstriped muscular fibre, running both around and\r\nlengthways, and also by connective-tissue fibres. In the arteries, the\r\nmuscular coating is much stronger than in the veins.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought that the space devoted to a discussion of the\r\nanatomical structure of the skin is disproportionately large;\r\nbut there can be no doubt that, in order to make improvements,\r\nnothing is of more importance than a clear conception, even to the\r\nsmallest details, of the materials and causes to be dealt with. The\r\nillustrations are from actual specimens, and enable the various parts\r\nof the hide to be identified under the microscope.\r\n\r\nAs this instrument is a most useful means of investigation in the\r\ntanning industry, and one likely to be of increasing importance, it\r\nwill be well, before proceeding further, to say a few words, both on\r\nthe selection of a suitable instrument, and on its manipulation in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nTo do useful work, it is not necessary to possess a very elaborate\r\nor expensive instrument, but it is essential that the microscope be\r\nwell made and good of its kind. As high powers are often required in\r\nthe examination, both of hide sections and of ferments, which are the\r\nprincipal objects of investigation in a tannery, it is of the first\r\nimportance that the fine adjustment should be perfectly steady, without\r\nvibration or backlash. This, in the writer's experience, is never the\r\ncase with cheap microscopes, in which the fine adjustment is made by\r\na screw at the side of the tube moving the nose by means of a lever.\r\nA much more satisfactory arrangement is that in which the whole body\r\nof the microscope is raised or lowered by a screw in a pillar at the\r\nback of the stand on which it slides. A rack for the coarse adjustment\r\nis useful, but not essential. If a sliding tube only is provided, it\r\nmust be tight enough not to slip, but must move easily up and down\r\nwith a sort of screwing movement. A mechanical stage is not at all\r\nnecessary, and for most purposes one of black glass is better as well\r\nas cheaper. The diaphragm for regulating the light should be as near\r\nlevel with the surface of the stage as possible, and when examined with\r\na low power should appear in the centre of the field. For research work\r\non the minuter ferments, an achromatic condenser and the finest oil-\r\nor water-immersion lenses are necessary, but directions for this are\r\nbeyond the scope of the present work. It may, however, be mentioned\r\nthat Prof. Flügge,[A] a first-class authority on the subject,\r\nespecially recommends Abbé's illuminating apparatus as made by Zeiss.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: \"Fermente und Mikroparasiten,\" Leipzig, 1883.]\r\n\r\nA frequent defect in cheap English microscopes is that the mirror for\r\nsubstage illumination does not bring the rays of a lamp to a focus\r\nexactly on the slide, but frequently some inches above it. This may be\r\nto a great extent overcome by the use of a bulls'-eye condenser between\r\nthe lamp and the microscope. Another defect is that sometimes the\r\ncentre of the mirror is not in a line with that of the microscope body.\r\n\r\nThe objectives (or lenses at the lower end of the microscope) are the\r\nmost important part of the instrument, and however good it may be in\r\nall other respects, if these are defective the whole is useless. The\r\nmost useful lenses for our purpose, if only two are to be selected, are\r\na 1-in., magnifying about 50 diam., and a 1/4-in., magnifying about 200\r\nto 400, according to the eye-piece; a 1/8-in. giving, say, twice this\r\nmagnification will be needed to see the smaller bacteria distinctly,\r\nbut it is possible just to see even the small putrefaction bacteria\r\nwith a really fine 1/4-in. In any case, the highest power should be as\r\nperfect and of as large an angle as attainable. A good 1/4-in. should\r\nresolve _Pleurosigma angulatum_ with direct light, and should show the\r\nmovement of the granules of protoplasm in the round corpuscles which\r\nare present in saliva. In using the latter test, it must be remembered\r\nthat the motion only lasts a very short time on a cold slide.\r\n\r\nAbout 5_l._ is the very least for which a microscope can be obtained\r\nwhich is suitable for tanners' use; where it can be afforded, a better\r\none is advisable.\r\n\r\nWithout disparaging other makers, it may be mentioned that the writer\r\nhas generally used both the eye-pieces and objectives of Dr. Hartnack\r\nof Potsdam; and that they are moderate in price, at least for the dry\r\ncombinations, and perfectly satisfactory for all technical purposes.\r\nNumbers 2, 5, and 8 objectives with No. 3 eye-piece, are sufficient\r\nfor all ordinary work. If only 2 objectives are to be obtained, Nos.\r\n3 and 7 would be perhaps the best selection. It is always better\r\nto use objectives on the stand, and with the eye-pieces for which\r\nthey are intended, but in case Hartnack's objectives are used on an\r\nEnglish stand (which is easily done by means of an adaptor ring), it\r\nis important to remember that they are constructed to work with a\r\nshorter tube than that customary on English microscopes, and that they\r\nwill not perform well if its length is much more than 6 in.; these\r\nobjectives are not provided with a movable adjustment for thickness\r\nof cover-glasses, which for technical purposes is not required, and\r\nin inexperienced hands is apt to prove troublesome. Extra-thin covers\r\nmust therefore always be used. Where this adjustment is provided, the\r\nobject must be accurately focused, and then, maintaining this focus\r\nwith the fine focusing-screw, the collar must be cautiously turned till\r\nthe best definition is obtained. Practically it will be best to make\r\nthis adjustment accurately once for all, and to take care to use covers\r\nselected of a uniform thickness.\r\n\r\nHigh-power objectives of wide angle (which condition is essential to\r\ngood defining power) necessarily work extremely close to the object,\r\nand it is always best to use the thinnest cover-glasses which can be\r\ngot. Even then, with such glasses as Hartnack's No. 8, unless the\r\nsections are very thin, it will be impossible to examine their lower\r\nparts; and one of the greatest difficulties of microscopic research\r\nis to obtain them thin enough. It will be obvious, from what has\r\nbeen said, that the greatest care is needed to avoid screwing the\r\nobjective down on the cover, and so breaking one or both of them. One\r\nway to avoid this is to screw down as close as possible to begin with,\r\nand then focus upwards. Another plan, when the object on the slide\r\nis small, is to keep continuously moving the slide gently with the\r\nfingers, while looking into the tube. It is then easy to notice when\r\nthe dust and small particles on the slide come into focus, and if the\r\npoint should happen to be overstepped the contact will generally be\r\nfelt before serious damage is done.\r\n\r\nIllumination is one of the most important points in practical\r\nmicroscopy. With powers of not less than 1/2-in. focus, objects may\r\ngenerally be examined by light thrown upon them from above by a\r\nbulls'-eye condenser, or by good daylight. In this case they need not\r\nbe transparent; and the plan is often convenient for a mere surface\r\nexamination. In examining bodies illuminated in this way, prominences\r\noften appear as hollows and _vice versâ_, by a sort of optical\r\nillusion, which, once established, is very difficult to overcome. By\r\nremembering the direction of the light, and that this appears reversed\r\nin the microscope, it is easy to decide the truth.\r\n\r\nFor all finer work and higher powers, and most generally with the low\r\npowers also, it is necessary to render the object transparent, and to\r\nexamine it by light transmitted from the mirror below the stage.\r\n\r\nGood daylight is least trying to the eyes. Where artificial light must\r\nbe used, that of a small paraffin lamp is best; and a blue chimney,\r\nor blue glass interposed between the stage and mirror, or lamp and\r\nmicroscope, spares the sight, and makes it easier to distinguish\r\ncolours. The light should be sufficient, but not too dazzling. Work\r\nshould never be prolonged after the least strain is felt, nor should\r\nthe microscope be used for some little time after a meal. It is well to\r\naccustom oneself to keep both the eyes open while observing.\r\n\r\nIf it be required to see how far the cellular structures of the hide,\r\nsuch as hair-sheaths and fat-glands, are affected or destroyed in any\r\nstage of liming or bating, the following ready method may be employed.\r\nIf a strip of hide be cut 2/3 through from the grain side, as shown\r\nat _a_ in Fig. 7, and the flap be turned down, and held between the\r\nfinger and thumb, the fibrous tissue will be put on the stretch, and\r\nwill then allow a moderately thin shaving (including the grain and\r\nparts immediately below it) to be cut by a sharp razor. The hide\r\nshould be held in the positions shown, and a steady drawing cut be\r\nmade from flesh to grain, the razor being steadied on the tip of\r\nthe forefinger, and its hollow surface flooded with water. If the\r\nthin section be now placed on a glass slide, moistened with a drop of\r\nwater, and examined on the microscope under a strong light from above,\r\nwith a 1-in. objective, the fat-glands will be seen as yellow masses,\r\nembedded in the white fibrous tissue. If a drop of a mixture of equal\r\nvols. of strong acetic acid, glycerin, and water be used to moisten the\r\nsection, the fibrous tissue will become quite transparent, and whatever\r\nremains of the cellular tissue will be easily visible, and may even be\r\nstudied under tolerably high powers if covered with a thin glass, and\r\nlighted by the mirror from below. (The cover-glass must be carefully\r\ncleaned by rubbing with a linen handkerchief, and placed in position\r\nwith a pair of tweezers, one side being supported by a needle, which is\r\ngradually withdrawn, so as to avoid air-bubbles.) Care must be taken\r\nthat this mixture does not touch the brass-work of the microscope; even\r\nthe vapour is apt to tarnish, so that the preparation must not remain\r\nlonger than necessary on the microscope. The same method is applicable\r\nfor ascertaining the completeness of the tannage of leather, and to\r\ndecide whether the hide fibre is really tanned, or only dyed. Actually\r\ntanned leather is unaffected by the acetic acid, but raw or only\r\nstained hide swells and becomes transparent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nTo prepare the very thin sections necessary for detailed study of the\r\nhide, more complicated methods are required. Small slips of hide, not\r\nexceeding 1/4 in. wide, and cut exactly across the lie of the hair,\r\nare placed first in weak alcohol (equal parts methylated spirit and\r\nwater), and, after a few hours, are removed into strong methylated\r\nspirit. It is then kept for some days in absolute alcohol, which must\r\nbe repeatedly changed, until the hide is hard enough to give fine\r\nshavings, and may be cut either when held as above described, between\r\ncork or pith, or when embedded in paraffin wax. This is accomplished\r\nby placing the piece of hide in a little paper-box and covering it\r\nwith melted paraffin (candle), which is just beginning to stiffen. The\r\npiece of hide may be fixed in position with a needle, which must of\r\ncourse be withdrawn before cutting. When hard, the paraffin is shaved\r\naway till the object is exposed, when it may be cut. The razor must be\r\nwet with alcohol, and the section be made exactly in the plane of the\r\nhair-roots, which may be seen with a hand-lens. (The use of a microtome\r\nfor hide-sections is rarely successful, as it is almost impossible to\r\nfix the fragment of hide so that it is cut exactly with the hairs.)\r\nThe slices may now be stained by placing them in a watch-glass with\r\nwater and a few drops of the logwood or picrocarmine staining-mixtures\r\nsold by opticians, and afterwards either examined in glycerin, or,\r\nafter soaking some hours in absolute alcohol, may be transferred to\r\nclove-oil, and afterwards to a slide, and covered with a drop of\r\ndammar varnish or Canada balsam dissolved in chloroform. The sections\r\nmoistened with glycerin may also be mounted in Farrant's solution\r\nor glycerin jelly, under a cover-glass for permanent preservation.\r\nIf picrocarmine be used, the connective-tissue fibres (gelatinous\r\nfibres) and the nuclei of the cells will be coloured red, and the cells\r\nthemselves of both epidermis and glands, together with the muscles and\r\nelastic fibres, will be yellow.\r\n\r\nFranz Kathreiner, who has made very elaborate researches on skin, and\r\nthe changes which take place in it during the processes of tanning,\r\nemploys a mixture of osmic and chromic acids for hardening, and at the\r\nsame time staining the tissue. This mixture was first used by a German\r\nhistologist with whose name I am not acquainted, in a research on the\r\ninternal organs of hearing, and was applied by Kathreiner in 1879 to\r\nthe investigation of skin, and communicated by him to the writer in\r\nthe autumn of that year. His method is briefly as follows. The pieces\r\nof hide to be examined must, if salted, be well washed, or if dry, be\r\nthoroughly softened. For the study of hide in its unaltered and natural\r\ncondition, it is essential that it be quite fresh, and taken from the\r\nanimal as soon as possible after death. In any case the _Panniculus\r\nadiposus_ or fatty layer is, as far as possible, removed with scissors,\r\nthe hair cut short, and the skin cut up into little pieces of 3-4\r\nmillimetres wide by 10-12 millimetres long (about 1/8 in. by 1/2 in.);\r\nthe hair must lie exactly across these pieces.\r\n\r\nThey are then placed for 4-8 days, according to the thickness of the\r\nhide, in about 12 times their volume of a solution consisting of\r\n\r\n    0·2 parts osmic acid.[B]\r\n    0·5   \"   chromic acid.\r\n  200·0   \"   water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: Solution of osmic acid is best preserved in sealed tubes\r\nin the dark. If obtained in solution it is rarely of full strength,\r\nfor which allowance may have to be made. Care must be taken to avoid\r\ninhaling its fumes, which are very irritating to the eyes and to the\r\nrespiratory organs, producing severe catarrh.]\r\n\r\nThis solution must be kept from dust and light, in a glass stoppered\r\nbottle, and in a cool place. On removing the hide-pieces from this\r\nsolution, they are placed in about 12 times their volume of absolute\r\nalcohol for 4-8 days, during which time the spirit must be at least 3\r\ntimes renewed. The sections are cut with a razor flooded with absolute\r\nalcohol, so that the thin shavings float without friction upon it. The\r\nhide-pieces may be held either between soft cork, or, as is generally\r\npreferable, simply between the forefinger and thumb as shown in Fig.\r\n7. The cut must be made exactly parallel with the direction of the\r\nhair roots, and from the grain towards the flesh; and the sections\r\ncannot possibly be too thin. After lying for 1/2-1 hour in absolute\r\nalcohol, the sections are soaked till quite clear in clove oil (which\r\nmust be pale and of the purest kind), and may then be mounted in dammar\r\nvarnish, or solution of Canada balsam.\r\n\r\nIn these sections, fat and the oily contents of the fat glands are\r\nstained black, and the limits of the cells both of these glands and of\r\nother elements of the hide (_rete malpighi_, hair-bulb, &c.) are made\r\nvery distinct, so as to be capable of the most delicate investigation\r\nunder the highest powers; but the beginner will learn most easily to\r\nrecognise the different tissues by studying at first some sections\r\nstained with picrocarmine as before described. The method is admirably\r\nadapted for the study of hide as affected by the limes and bates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF HIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of skin is very imperfectly understood. The\r\nbulk of the skin is, as has long been known, converted by boiling\r\ninto gelatin or glue. The yellow fibres and cellular tissue remain\r\nundissolved. Müntz, who made some interesting researches on the\r\nsubject, found that completely dried hide contained--3·086 per cent. of\r\ncellular tissue insoluble in hot water, 1·058 of fat, 0·467 of mineral\r\nmatter, and 95·395 of matters soluble in hot water. Müntz counts the\r\nwhole of the tissue soluble in hot water as converted into glue; but\r\nthis is not strictly the case. Gelatin is not identical with the fibre\r\nof the hide, which is only converted into it by boiling. The nature of\r\nthe change is not well understood; but it is either simply molecular,\r\nor depends on the addition of one or more molecules of water. The\r\ngelatin of bones seems identical with that of skin and connective\r\ntissue, but that of cartilage differs slightly from it, and is called\r\nchondrin. Raw hide, unhaired and purified, contains, according to\r\nMüntz--carbon, 51·43 per cent.; hydrogen, 6·64; nitrogen, 18·16;\r\noxygen, 23·06; ash, 0·71; while gelatin has--carbon, 50·1 per cent.;\r\nhydrogen, 6·6; nitrogen, 18·3 (Mulder); carbon, 50 per cent.; hydrogen,\r\n6·5; nitrogen, 17·5 (Fremy). Probably, however, neither substance was\r\nquite pure.\r\n\r\nGelatin is insoluble in alcohol, ether, and cold water, but swells in\r\nthe last, absorbing about 40 per cent. It is soluble in hot water,\r\nbut is reprecipitated on the addition of a sufficient quantity of\r\nalcohol, resembling in this respect gum, dextrin, and many other\r\nsubstances. It is soluble in glycerin, with the aid of heat, and in\r\nconcentrated sulphuric acid in the cold. Moist gelatin exposed to\r\nthe air rapidly putrefies. It first becomes very acid, from formation\r\nof butyric (and perhaps other) acids, but afterwards alkaline, from\r\nevolution of ammonia. Boiled with concentrated potash, it yields leucin\r\n(amidocaproic acid, C_{6}H_{15}NO_{2}), glycocin (sugar of gelatin),\r\nand other substances. The same products are obtained by boiling with\r\nsulphuric acid, and probably also more gradually, and in greater or\r\nless proportions, by the prolonged action of lime or barium hydrate,\r\nby putrefaction, and by any other influence which tends to resolve the\r\ngelatin molecule into its simpler parts. Gelatin is precipitated by all\r\ntannins, even from very dilute solution. A solution containing 2/10000\r\nparts is rendered turbid by infusion of gall-nuts or gallotannic acid.\r\nThe precipitate is soluble in excess of gelatin. Solution of gelatin\r\ndissolves considerable quantities of lime phosphate, hence this is\r\nalways largely present in common glue. Gelatin is precipitated by\r\nmercuric chloride, in this respect resembling peptones; but not by\r\npotassium ferrocyanide, by which it is distinguished from albuminoids;\r\nand it differs from albumen in not being coagulated by heat. On the\r\ncontrary, by prolonged boiling glue loses the property of gelatinising,\r\nand becomes soluble in cold water, being split up into two peptones;\r\nsemi-glutin, which is insoluble in alcohol, and precipitated by\r\nplatinic chloride; and hemicollin, which is soluble in alcohol, and not\r\nprecipitated by platinic chloride. Both are precipitated by mercuric\r\nchloride (see Hofmeister, abst. Chem. Soc. Jour. 1881, p. 294).\r\nGelatin or glue with about 3 per cent. of potassium dichromate becomes\r\ninsoluble when exposed to the light, from the formation of a chromium\r\ncompound. This reaction is the base of several modern photographic\r\nprocesses, and has been used for waterproofing and for cementing glass,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nThe connective-tissue fibres are partially converted into gelatin\r\nby the action of strong acids and alkalies, as well as by heat. By\r\nweak acids, they are swollen and gradually dissolved, and Reimer[C]\r\nhas found that the material may be reprecipitated by lime-water. It\r\nforms an irregular fibrous mass, which has not the sticky feel of\r\ngelatin, but is at once converted into that body by boiling. Rollet has\r\ndemonstrated that when hide and other forms of connective tissue are\r\nsoaked in lime- or baryta-water, the fibres become split up into finer\r\nfibrils, and as the action proceeds, these again separate into still\r\nfiner, till the ultimate fibrils are as fine as can be distinguished\r\nunder a powerful microscope. At the same time, the alkaline solution\r\ndissolves the substance which cemented the fibres together, and this\r\nmay be recovered by neutralising the solution with acetic acid, when it\r\ncomes down as a flocculent precipitate. This was considered by Rollet\r\nto be an albuminoid substance; but Reimer has shown that it is much\r\nmore closely allied to the gelatigenous fibres, if indeed it is not\r\nactually produced from them by the action of the alkaline solution.\r\nReimer used limed calf-skin for his experiments, and subjected it to\r\nprolonged cleansing with distilled water, so that all soluble parts\r\nmust have been pretty thoroughly removed beforehand. He then digested\r\nit in closed glasses with lime-water for 7-8 days, and precipitated the\r\nclear solution with dilute acetic acid. He found that the same portion\r\nof hide might be used again and again, without becoming exhausted,\r\nwhich strongly supports the supposition that it is merely a product of\r\nthe partial decomposition of the hide fibre. The substance, which he\r\ncalled \"coriin,\" was purified by repeated solution in lime-water, and\r\nreprecipitation by acetic acid. It was readily soluble by alkalies,\r\nbut insoluble in dilute acids, though in some cases it became so\r\nswollen and finely divided as to appear almost as if dissolved. It was,\r\nhowever, very soluble in common salt solution of about 10 per cent.,\r\nthough it was precipitated both by the addition of much water, and by\r\nsaturating the solution with salt. Reimer found that a 10 per cent.\r\nsalt solution was equally effective with lime-water in extracting it\r\nfrom the hide, and that it was partially precipitated on the addition\r\nof acid, and completely on saturating the acidified solution with\r\nsalt. Other salts of the alkalies and alkaline earths acted in a\r\nsimilar manner, so that Reimer was at first deceived when experimenting\r\nwith baryta-water, because, being more concentrated than lime-water,\r\nthe coriin remained dissolved in the baryta salt formed on neutralising\r\nwith acid, and it was necessary to dilute before a precipitate could\r\nbe obtained. The slightly acid solution of coriin gave no precipitate\r\nwith potassium ferrocyanide, nor was it precipitated by boiling, being\r\nthus distinguished from albuminoids. The neutral or alkaline solution\r\nwas not precipitated by iron or mercuric chloride, copper sulphate, nor\r\nby neutral lead acetate; but was precipitated by basic lead acetate,\r\nbasic iron sulphate, and excess of tannin. Its elementary composition\r\nis--carbon, 45·91: hydrogen, 6·57; nitrogen, 17·82; oxygen, 29·60; and\r\nReimer proposes the following equation as representing its relation to\r\nhide fibre:--\r\n\r\n       Hide fibre.                 Water.             Coriin.\r\n  C_{30}H_{46}N_{10}O_{12} + O  +  2H_{2}O  =  C_{30}H_{50}N_{10}O_{15}.\r\n\r\n[Footnote C: Dingler's Polyt. Journal, vol. 220, p. 167.]\r\n\r\n_Hide Albumen._--The fresh hide, besides this coriin (which, very\r\npossibly, is only evolved by the action of the lime), contains a\r\nportion of actual albumen, viz. that of the blood serum and of the\r\nlymph, which is not only contained in the abundant blood-vessels,\r\nbut saturates the fibrous connective tissue, of which it forms\r\nthe nourishment. This albumen is mostly removed by the liming and\r\nworking on the beam, which is preparatory to tanning. Probably for\r\nsole-leather, the albumen itself would be rather advantageous if left\r\nin the hide, as it combines with tannin, and would assist in giving\r\nfirmness and weight to the leather. It is, however, for reasons which\r\nwill be seen hereafter, absolutely necessary to get rid of any lime\r\nwhich may be in combination with it. The blood also must be thoroughly\r\ncleansed from the hide before tanning, as its colouring matter contains\r\niron, and, in combination with the tannin, would give a bad colour.\r\n\r\nThe reactions of blood and lymph albumen are very similar to those\r\nof ordinary white of egg. It is precipitated by strong mineral acids,\r\nespecially nitric, and also by boiling. The precipitate produced by\r\nstrong hydrochloric acid redissolves by the aid of heat to a blue\r\nor purple solution. Tribasic phosphoric, tartaric, acetic, and most\r\nother organic acids, do not precipitate moderately dilute solutions\r\nof albumen, but convert it into a sort of jelly, which, like gelatin,\r\ndoes not coagulate, but liquefies on heating. It is precipitated by\r\nneutral salts of the alkali metals. Blood-albumen slightly acidified\r\n(with acetic acid) is precipitated by potassium ferrocyanide. It is\r\nnot precipitated by dilute infusions of oak bark, but is rendered\r\nuncoagulable by heat, hence it cannot be employed to remove tannins\r\nfrom their solutions.\r\n\r\n_Elastic Fibres._--The elastic or yellow fibres of the hide are of\r\na very stable character. They are not completely dissolved even by\r\nprolonged boiling, and acetic acid and hot solutions of caustic\r\nalkalies scarcely attack them. Probably they do not combine with\r\ntannin, and are very little changed in the tanning process.\r\n\r\n_Hair, Epidermis, and Glands._--These are, as has been seen, all\r\nderived from the epithelial layer, and hence, as might be inferred,\r\nhave much in common in their chemical constitution. They are all\r\nclassed by chemists under one name, \"keratin,\" or horny tissue, and\r\ntheir ultimate analysis shows that in elementary composition they\r\nnearly agree. It is evident, however, that the horny tissues are rather\r\na class than a single compound.\r\n\r\nThe keratins are gradually loosened by prolonged soaking in water,\r\nand, by continued boiling in a Papin's digester, are dissolved to an\r\nextract which does not gelatinise on cooling. Keratin is dissolved by\r\ncaustic alkalies; the epidermis and the softer horny tissues are easily\r\nattacked, while hair and horn require strong solutions and the aid of\r\nheat to effect complete solution. The caustic alkaline earths act in\r\nthe same manner as dilute alkaline solutions; hence lime easily attacks\r\nthe epidermis, and loosens the hair, but does not readily destroy the\r\nlatter. Alkaline sulphides, on the other hand, seem to attack the\r\nharder tissues with at least the same facility as the soft ones, the\r\nhair being often completely disintegrated, while the epidermis is still\r\nalmost intact; hence their applicability to unhairing by destruction of\r\nthe hair. Keratins are dissolved by fuming hydrochloric acid, with the\r\nproduction of a blue or violet coloration, like the albuminoids. They\r\nalso resemble albumen, in the fact that their solution in sulphuric\r\nacid is precipitated by potassium ferrocyanide. By fusion with potash,\r\nor prolonged boiling with dilute sulphuric acid, keratin is decomposed,\r\nyielding leucin, tyrosin, ammonia, &c. The alkaline solution of keratin\r\n(hair, horns, &c.) is precipitated by acids, and, mixed with oil and\r\nbaryta sulphate, is employed under Dr. Putz's patent as a filling\r\nmaterial for leather, for which purpose it acts in the same way as the\r\negg-yolks and meal used in kid-leather manufacture. Eitner attempted\r\nto use it for the same purpose with bark-tanned leather, but without\r\nmuch success. Putz has also proposed to precipitate the material after\r\nworking its solution into the pores of the leather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL TANNING MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Algarobilla.=--The seed-pods of _Prosopis pallida_ and _P. Algarrobo_\r\nare known as _algarobilla_, the two kinds being distinguished as\r\n_negro_ and _blanco_. The trees are abundant in mountainous parts\r\nof South America, notably Chili and the Argentine Republic. The\r\npods contain up to 50 per cent. of a bright-yellow tannin, somewhat\r\nresembling that of myrobalans. The friable tannin is readily soluble\r\nin cold water, and is so loosely held in the fibrous network of the\r\npod, that great loss is sustained by careless handling. The commerce\r\nin algarobilla does not figure in the official trade returns; but J.\r\nGordon & Co., Liverpool, obligingly state that they imported 50 tons,\r\nat an average value of 18_l._ 10_s._ a ton, in 1880. Widow Duranty &\r\nSon, also of Liverpool, are good enough to add that they received 160\r\ntons in 1881, the first that had reached them for a long time. Havre\r\nimported 50 tons in 1881. The name _algarrobo_ is also applied to\r\n_Balsamocarpon brevifolium_ in Chili, and to _Hymenæa Courbaril_ in\r\nPanama.\r\n\r\n=Chestnut-extract.=--The wood of the chestnut (_Castanea vesca_)\r\ncontains 14-20 per cent. of a dull-brown tannin. It is quite different\r\nfrom the bark and bark-extract of the American chestnut-oak (_Quercus\r\nsessiliflora_). Its extract is used largely to modify the colour\r\nproduced by hemlock-extract, and for tanning and dyeing. The pulverised\r\nwood is also extensively employed in France. The imports are included\r\nin barks and extracts, p. 39.\r\n\r\n=Cork-bark.= See Oak-barks.\r\n\r\n=Cutch, Catechu, or Terra Japonica= (Fr., _Cachou_; Ger.,\r\n_Catechu_).--The term _kát_, _kut_, or \"cutch,\" is applied to the\r\ndried extract, containing 45-55 per cent. of dark-coloured mimo-tannic\r\nacid, prepared chiefly from 2 trees:--(1) _Acacia Catechu_ [_Mimosa\r\nCatechu_, _M. sundra_], a tree of 30-40 ft., common in most parts of\r\nIndia and Burma, growing also in the hotter and drier districts of\r\nCeylon, and abundant in tropical East Africa--the Soudan, Sennar,\r\nAbyssinia, the Noer country and Mozambique, though the utilisation of\r\nits tannin is restricted to India; (2) _A._ [_M._] _Suma_, a large tree\r\ninhabiting South India (Mysore), Bengal, and Gujerat.\r\n\r\nThe process for preparing cutch varies slightly in different districts.\r\nThe trees are reckoned to be of proper age when their trunks are about\r\n1 ft. diam. They are then cut down, and the whole of the woody part,\r\nwith the exception of the smaller branches and the bark, is reduced\r\nto chips: some accounts state that only the darker heart-wood is thus\r\nused. The chips are placed with water in earthen jars, arranged in a\r\nseries over a mud fire-place, usually in the open air. Here the water\r\nis made to boil, the liquor as it becomes thick and strong being\r\ndecanted into another vessel, in which the evaporation is continued\r\nuntil the extract is sufficiently inspissated, when it is poured into\r\nmoulds made of clay, or of leaves pinned together in the shape of\r\ncups, or in some districts on to a mat covered with the ashes of burnt\r\ncow-dung, the drying in each case being completed by exposure to the\r\nsun and air. The product is a dark-brown extract, which is the usual\r\nform in which cutch is known in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Kumaon, North India, a slight modification of the process affords\r\na drug of very different appearance. Instead of evaporating the\r\ndecoction to the condition of an extract, the inspissation is stopped\r\nat a certain point, and the liquor is allowed to cool, coagulate,\r\nand crystallise over twigs and leaves thrown into the pots for the\r\npurpose. By this method is obtained from each pot about 2 lb. of _kath_\r\nor catechu, of an ashy-whitish appearance. In Burma, the manufacture\r\nand export of cutch form one of the most important items of forest\r\nrevenue. The quantity of cutch exported from the province in 1869-70\r\nwas 10,782 tons, valued at 193,602_l._, of which nearly half was the\r\nproduce of manufactories situated in British territory. The article is\r\nimported in mats, bags, and boxes, often enveloped in the large leaf of\r\n_Dipterocarpus tuberculatus_. It is brought down from Berar and Nepal\r\nto Calcutta. That of Pegu has a high reputation.\r\n\r\nOur imports of cutch in 1880 were 5155 tons, value 173,040_l._, from\r\nthe British East Indies; 539 tons, 15,572_l._, from other countries;\r\ntotal, 5694 tons, 188,612_l._ Our exports in the same year were:--892\r\ntons, 28,527_l._, to Germany; 676 tons, 24,562_l._, to the United\r\nStates; 478 tons, 15,505_l._, to France; 303 tons, 10,537_l._, to\r\nHolland; 177 tons, 5859_l._, to Russia; 141 tons, 4835_l._, to Belgium;\r\n245 tons, 8719_l._, to other countries; total, 2912 tons, 98,544_l._\r\nThe approximate London market value of Pegu cutch is 21-42_s._ a cwt.\r\n\r\nAn astringent extract prepared from the areca nut (_Areca Catechu_) is\r\nsaid to contribute to commercial cutch; if so, it is a totally distinct\r\nproduct from those just described.\r\n\r\n=Divi-divi, or Libi-dibi.=--These names are applied to the seed-pods of\r\n_Cæsalpinia coriaria_, a tree of 20-30 ft., indigenous to several of\r\nthe West Indies, Mexico, Venezuela, and North Brazil, and naturalised\r\nin Madras and Bombay Presidencies, and in the North-West Provinces.\r\nThe pod may be known by its drying to the shape of a letter S; it\r\ncontains 30-50 per cent. of a peculiar tannin, somewhat similar to that\r\nof valonia. It is cheap, and may be used in admixture with barks; but\r\nit is dangerously liable to undergo fermentation, suddenly staining\r\nthe leather a dark-red colour, and is therefore not in extensive\r\nuse. The imports of it are mainly from Maracaibo, Paraiba, and St.\r\nDomingo. Maracaibo, in 1880, exported 197,674 lb. of divi-divi, value\r\n3222-1/4 dol. (4_s._ 2_d._), to New York. Our imports of divi-divi into\r\nLiverpool, according to figures kindly furnished by Haw & Co., were\r\n2200 tons in 1877, 1740 in 1878, 2132 in 1879, and 780 in 1880. The\r\napproximate market value is 12-17_l._ a ton.\r\n\r\n=Galls.=--The generic term \"gall\" is applied to those excrescences on\r\nplants which are produced by the punctures of insects, for the purpose\r\nof depositing their eggs. The excrescences are usually considered to be\r\na diseased condition of vegetable tissue, resulting from the injection\r\nof some secretion of the insects. But this has been combated by A.\r\nS. Wilson, of Aberdeen, who considers that all insect galls are in\r\nreality leaf-buds, or fruit-buds, and not mere amorphous excrescences.\r\nThe vascular lines which would form leaves can easily be followed up\r\nin the structure of the oak-leaf galls. And in cases where the egg\r\nhas been deposited in the tissue of a young branch, the cap of the\r\ngall is sometimes surmounted by a leaf 2-3 in. long. But in the large\r\nblue Turkish galls, many lacunæ occur where the fleshified leaves have\r\nnot filled up the spaces between them. If a dissection be made of one\r\nof the weevil-galls on the bulb of the turnip, the second or third\r\nslice will show the outer foliations, exactly similar to those of the\r\nroot-buds. When the centre has been reached, where the maggot will be\r\nfound, there will also be a vascular pencil running up from a medullary\r\nray in the bulb, and bearing on its top a bud of the same description\r\nas that produced by a ray running out from a root. The insertion of the\r\novipositor brings a medullary ray into action, producing a tuberculated\r\nbud, and it is only the bud which the larva feeds upon. The growth of a\r\nbud is an intelligible cause of the growth of a gall, but nothing can\r\nbe inferred from the injection of a fluid. The analogy to leaves is\r\nfurther shown by the fact that various microscopic fungi are matured in\r\nthe interior of imperforate galls.\r\n\r\nThe principal commercial kinds of gall are oak-galls and Chinese galls.\r\n\r\n_Oak-galls_, _Nut-galls_, _Aleppo_ or _Turkey-galls_ (Fr., _Noix de\r\nGalle_, _Galle d'Alep_; Ger., _Levantische_ or _Aleppische Gallen_,\r\n_Galläpfel_).--These are formed by the punctures of _Cynips_\r\n[_Diplolepis_] _Gallæ tinctoriæ_ on _Quercus lusitanica_ var.\r\n_infectoria_ [_Q. infectoria_], a shrubby tree of Greece, Cyprus, Asia\r\nMinor, and Syria, and probably other varieties and even species of oak.\r\nThe female insect is furnished with a delicate ovipositor, by means of\r\nwhich she pierces the tender shoots of the tree, and lays her eggs\r\ntherein. In the centre of the full-grown gall, the larva is hatched\r\nand undergoes its transformations, finally (in 5-6 months) becoming a\r\nwinged insect, and boring for itself a cylindrical exit-hole. The best\r\ncommercial galls are those which have been gathered while the insect\r\nis still in the larval state. Such have a dark olive-green colour, and\r\nare comparatively heavy; but after the fly has escaped, they become\r\nyellowish-brown in hue, and lighter. Hence they are distinguished in\r\nthe London market as \"blue\" or \"green,\" and \"white.\" In Smyrna, they\r\nare classified as \"white,\" \"green,\" and \"black,\" the first two sorts\r\ngenerally fetching nearly the same price, while the black obtain\r\nconsiderably more, the approximate quotations being: white and green,\r\nper Turkish _oke_ (of 2·83 lb.), 8-1/2-9 _piastres_ (of 2_d._);\r\nblack, 13-1/2-14 _piastres_. The \"nuts\" come mostly from Melemen,\r\nCassaba, and Magnesia, also from the Syrian coasts, being plentiful\r\non the east of the river Jordan, and are chiefly forwarded to France,\r\nEngland, and Salonica. The triennial yield is said to be invariably\r\nthe best. They begin to reach Smyrna from the interior towards the\r\nend of July. The crop of 1880 was estimated at over 50,000 _okes_.\r\nThe province of Aleppo, which used to afford 10,000-12,000 _quintals_\r\n(of 2 cwt.) annually, only exported 3000 in 1871. The galls collected\r\nin the Kurdistan mountains are marketed at Diarbekir, and sent thence\r\nto Trebizonde for shipment. Bussora, Bagdad, and Bushire also export\r\nconsiderable quantities.\r\n\r\n_Knoppern_, a species of gall formed from the immature acorns of\r\n_Quercus pedunculata_ and _Q. sessiliflora_, are largely used for\r\ntanning throughout Austria.\r\n\r\nThe exports from Aleppo (including yellow berries) in 1880 were:--60\r\ntons, 3600_l._, to Great Britain; 322 tons, 19,320_l._, France; 15\r\ntons, 900_l._, Italy; 44 tons, 2640_l._, Austria; 55 tons, 3300_l._,\r\nTurkey; 30 tons, 1800_l._, Egypt; total, 526 tons, 31,560_l._ In\r\n1878, the figures were 673 tons, 38,400_l._ Alexandretta exported in\r\n1879 (including yellow berries):--41 tons, 2460_l._, to England; 299\r\ntons, 17,940_l._, France; 20 tons, 1200_l._, Italy; 25 tons, 1500_l._,\r\nAustria; 87 tons, 5220_l._, Turkey; 6 tons, 360_l._, Egypt; total\r\n478 tons, 28,680_l._ The shipments from Trebizonde by steamer in 1880\r\nwere (from Turkey):--47 sacks (of 2 cwt.), 188_l._, to Turkey; 240\r\nsacks, 960_l._, Great Britain; 264 sacks, 1056_l._, France; 103 sacks,\r\n412_l._, Austria and Germany; 26 sacks, 104_l._, Greece; total, 680\r\nsacks, 2720_l._; (from Persia): 25 sacks, 100_l._, Great Britain; 31\r\nsacks, 124_l._, France; 30 sacks, 120_l._, Austria and Germany; total,\r\n86 sacks, 344_l._ Bushire despatched 5000_r._ worth to India in 1879.\r\nSyra sent 248_l._ worth to Great Britain in 1879. Venice exported 1745\r\ntons of gall and bark, value 34,906_l._, in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe best oak-galls contain 60-70 per cent. of tannic or gallotannic\r\nacid, and 3 per cent. of gallic acid. \"Rove\" is a small crushed gall,\r\ncontaining 24-34 per cent. of gallotannic acid. There are many other\r\nvarieties of non-commercial oak-gall.\r\n\r\n_Chinese or Japanese Galls._--These are vesicular protuberances\r\nformed on the leaf-stalks and branches of the _Rhus semialata_\r\n[_Bucki-amela_], a tree of 30-40 ft., common in North India, China, and\r\nJapan, ascending the outer Himálaya and the Khasia Hills to 2500-6000\r\nft., by punctures of the female of _Aphis chinensis_. The galls are\r\ncollected when their green colour is changing to yellow, and are then\r\nscalded. They are light and hollow, 1-2-1/2 in. long, and of very\r\nvaried and irregular form. The Japanese are the smaller and paler,\r\nand usually more esteemed. The galls contain about 70 per cent. of\r\ntannic or gallotannic acid, and 4 per cent. of another tannin. They are\r\nconsumed mainly in Germany, for the manufacture of tannic acid.\r\n\r\nHankow exported 30,949 _piculs_ (of 133-1/3 lb.) in 1872; and 21,611\r\n_piculs_, value 136,214 _taels_ (of about 6_s._), in 1874. In 1877, the\r\ntotal Chinese export did not exceed 17,515 _piculs_. Hankow exported\r\n24,742-1/2 _piculs_ in 1878, and 28,392 _piculs_, 59,614_l._, in 1879;\r\nPakhoi, 62_l._ worth in 1879; Canton, 3155-1/3 _piculs_ in 1877, 1939\r\nin 1878, 3163-1/2 in 1879; Ichang, 100-1/2 _piculs_, 132_l._, in 1878,\r\n402-1/2 _piculs_, 586_l._, in 1879; Shanghai, 27,659-1/2 _piculs_ in\r\n1879.\r\n\r\nIn China trade returns, they are always miscalled \"nut-galls\" or\r\n\"gall-nuts\": correctly, they are _wu-pei-tze_. Oak-galls are exported\r\nfrom China resembling those of Western Asia. Japanese galls, _kifushi_,\r\nare sent in increasing quantities from Hiogo.\r\n\r\nOur imports of galls in 1880 were:--24,590 cwt., 68,697_l._, from\r\nChina; 17,311 cwt., 60,648_l._, from Turkey; 9182 cwt., 9013_l._,\r\nfrom other countries: total, 51,083 cwt., 138,358_l._ Our re-exports\r\nin the same year were:--6260 cwt., 18,479_l._, to Holland; 6022\r\ncwt., 18,147_l._, to Germany; 3214 cwt., 11,002_l._, to France; 3045\r\ncwt., 8598_l._, to Belgium; 2651 cwt., 11,004_l._, to the United\r\nStates; 1625 cwt., 5205_l._, to other countries; total, 22,817 cwt.,\r\n72,435_l._ The approximate London market values of galls are:--Bussora,\r\nblue, 82-102_s._ a cwt.; do., white and in sorts, 50-90_s._; China,\r\n50-70_s._; Japan, 55-56_s._\r\n\r\n=Gambier, Pale Catechu, or Terra Japonica= (Fr., _Gambir_, _Cachou\r\njaune_; Ger., _Gambir_).--These names are conferred upon an extract\r\nfrom the leaves of _Uncaria Gambier_ [_Nauclea Gambir_] and _U. acida_,\r\ncontaining 36-40 per cent. of a brown tannin, which rapidly penetrates\r\nleather, and tends to swell it, but alone gives a soft porous tannage;\r\nit is largely used in conjunction with other materials for tanning\r\nboth dressing- and sole-leather. The plants are stout climbing shrubs,\r\nthe first-named being a native of the countries bordering the Straits\r\nof Malacca, and especially the islands at the eastern end, though\r\napparently not indigenous to any of the islands of the volcanic band,\r\ngrowing also in Ceylon, where no use is made of it; while the second,\r\nprobably a mere variety, flourishes in the Malay islands.\r\n\r\nThe shrubs are cultivated in plantations, often formed in jungle\r\nclearings; the soil is very rapidly exhausted, and further injured\r\nby excessive growth of the ineradicable _lalang_-grass (_Andropogon\r\ncaricosus_). It is found advantageous to combine pepper-culture with\r\nthat of gambier, the boiled leaves of the latter forming excellent\r\nmanure for the former. The gambier-plants are allowed to grow 8-10\r\nft. high, and as their foliage is always in season, each plant is\r\nstripped 3 or 4 times in the year. The tools and apparatus for the\r\nmanufacture of the extract are of the most primitive description. A\r\nshallow cast-iron pan about 3 ft. across is built into an earthen\r\nfire-place. Water is poured into the pan, a fire is kindled, and the\r\nleaves and young shoots, freshly plucked, are scattered in, and boiled\r\nfor about an hour. At the end of this time, they are thrown on to a\r\ncapacious sloping trough, the lower end of which projects into the pan,\r\nand are squeezed with the hand so that the absorbed liquor may run back\r\ninto the boiler. The decoction is then evaporated to the consistence\r\nof a thin syrup, and baled out into buckets. When sufficiently cool,\r\nit is subjected to curious treatment: instead of simply stirring it\r\nround, the workman pushes a stick of soft wood in a sloping direction\r\ninto each bucket; and, placing two such buckets before him, he works a\r\nstick up and down in each. The liquid thickens round the stick, and,\r\nthe thickened portion being constantly rubbed off, while at the same\r\ntime the whole is in motion, it gradually sets into a mass, a result\r\nwhich, it is said, would never be produced by simple stirring: it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that this manner of treating the liquor favours\r\nthe crystallisation of the catechin in a more concrete form than it\r\nmight otherwise assume. The thickened mass, resembling soft yellowish\r\nclay, is now placed in shallow square boxes; when somewhat hardened,\r\nit is cut into cubes, and dried in the shade. The leaves are boiled a\r\nsecond time, and finally washed in water, which is saved for another\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nA second plan is as follows:--The leaves are boiled, and bruised in a\r\nwooden mortar (_lesong_), from which they are put into a kind of basket\r\nof rattan open-work, which is pressed by a long piece of wood acting\r\nas a lever; the liquid is received into a trough, and there allowed to\r\nsettle. When the sediment has acquired sufficient substance, it is put\r\ninto a _kulit-kayo_, formed like a tub without a bottom, which lets\r\nthe superfluous water drain off; when that is done, it is taken out,\r\nmade into small cakes, and dried for use. A plantation employing 5\r\nlabourers contains 70,000-80,000 shrubs, and yields 40-50 _catties_ (of\r\n1-1/3 lb.) of gambier daily.\r\n\r\nPlantations were commenced in Singapore in 1829, and once numbered 800;\r\nbut owing to scarcity of fuel, abundance of which is essential to the\r\nmanufacture, and dearness of labour, the culture was fast declining\r\nin 1866. In 1872, it had much recovered. It is largely pursued on\r\nthe mainland (Johore), and in the Rhio-Lingga Archipelago, S.-E. of\r\nSingapore; on Bintang, the most northerly of the group, there were 1250\r\nplantations of it in 1854. None is cultivated in Sarawak, though found\r\nwild in many parts; the foreign export from Sarawak in 1879 had a total\r\nvalue of 88,148 dol. The best kind is brought largely from Sumatra,\r\nbut is often adulterated with sago. The Rhio product is also thus\r\nsophisticated, and rendered heavier by the Chinese purposely packing\r\nit in baskets lined with wet _cajangs_, occasioning a loss to the\r\npurchaser of about 30 per cent.\r\n\r\nSingapore is the great emporium for gambier, and exported 34,248 tons\r\nin 1871, 19,550 tons having been imported, chiefly from Rhio and the\r\nMalay Peninsula. In 1876, the export increased to over 50,000 tons of\r\npressed block, and 2700 tons of cubes. In 1877, it fell to 39,117 tons,\r\nowing to differences with the Chinese dealers concerning adulteration;\r\nof this quantity, 21,607 tons were for London, 7572 for Liverpool, and\r\n2345 for Marseilles. The United Kingdom imports in 1872 were 21,155\r\ntons, 451,737_l._, almost all from the Straits Settlements; in 1880,\r\nthey were 26,061 tons, 461,781_l._, from the Straits, and 352 tons,\r\n6468_l._, from other countries; total, 26,413 tons, 468,249_l._ Our\r\nre-exports in 1880 were:--2487 tons, 48,507_l._, to Holland; 1591 tons,\r\n31,542_l._ to Germany; 1137 tons, 23,694_l._, to Russia; 594 tons,\r\n12,026_l._, to other countries; total, 5809 tons, 115,769_l._ The\r\napproximate London market values are 15_s._ 6_d._-21_s._ 6_d._ a cwt.\r\nfor block, 18-24_s._ for pressed cubes, and 23-27_s._ for free cubes.\r\n\r\n=Hemlock.=--The bark of the hemlock or hemlock spruce (_Abies\r\ncanadensis_), of Canada and the United States, contains nearly 14 per\r\ncent. of tannin. The stripping of the bark commences in the southern\r\nparts of the United States in spring, and lasts during April-May;\r\nin New York, Michigan, and Wisconsin, the season is June-July; and\r\nfarther north, it is still later. It is said that the best product is\r\nobtained farthest south. The destruction of the hemlock forests is fast\r\napproaching. Within the last 25 years, the preparation of an extract\r\nfrom the bark, containing 18-25 per cent. of a deep-red tannin, giving\r\nconsiderable weight and firmness to leather, has superseded the export\r\nof crude bark. One mode of preparing the extract is as follows:--The\r\nbark in pieces 1/2-1 in. thick, and several inches long, is soaked for\r\nabout 15 minutes in water at 200° F. (93° C.); it is then fed into\r\na hopper, which conducts it to a 3-roller machine, something like a\r\nsugar-cane mill, through which it passes, coming out lacerated and\r\ncompressed; it next falls into a vat of hot water, where it is agitated\r\nby a wheel, that the tannin from the crushed cells may be dissolved\r\nin the water; hence it is raised by a series of buckets on an endless\r\nchain, somewhat in the manner of a grain-elevator, to another hopper,\r\nwhence it is fed to another 3-roller mill; here it receives its final\r\ncompression, and comes out in flakes or sheets, like coarse paper, and\r\nalmost free from tannin. The buckets are made of coarse wire, that the\r\nwater may drip through during the elevation. In order to avoid the\r\nblackening action of iron, wherever this metal will come into contact\r\nwith the solutions it is thickly coated with zinc. The solution is\r\nevaporated to a solid consistency, generally by vacuum-pans. About\r\n2 tons of bark are represented by 1 bar. (of less than 500 lb.) of\r\nextract. The chief makers are A. S. Thomas, Elmira, N.Y.; S. Brown &\r\nCo., New York; Canada Tanning Extract Co., St. Leonard and Bulstrode;\r\nJ. Miller & Co., Millerton, New Brunswick. The total production is\r\nprobably over 10,000 tons annually, ranging in value between 14_l._ and\r\n20_l._ a ton. Our imports are included in barks and extracts.\r\n\r\n=Kino= (Fr., _Kino_; Ger., _Kino_).--The term \"gum kino\" is applied\r\nto a class of astringent extracts of varied origin, none of which can\r\naccurately be called either resins or gums.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pl. II.\r\n\r\n  _E. & F. N. Spon, London & New York._  \"INK-PHOTO\" SPRAGUE & CO. LONDON.\r\n\r\nREMOVING THE HAIR; SCRAPING AND CLEANING THE SKINS.]\r\n\r\n(1) _East Indian or Amboyna Kino._--This is obtained from _Pterocarpus\r\nMarsupium_, a common tree in the central and southern parts of the\r\nIndian peninsula, and in Ceylon; and a liquid kind from _P. indicus_,\r\nof South India, Burma, Malacca, Penang, the Andamans, and Malaysia.\r\nThe collection of the juice is effected in the following manner. A\r\nperpendicular incision, with lateral offshoots, is made in the stem of\r\nthe tree when blossoming has set in, and a receptacle is placed at the\r\nfoot of the incision. The exuding juice appears like red-currant jelly,\r\nbut it soon thickens by exposure to the air, and when sufficiently\r\ndried, is packed into wooden boxes for exportation. It is one of the\r\nreserved timber-trees of the Government forests in Madras, and its\r\njuice is collected by natives, who pay a small fee for the permission.\r\nThe hardened juice consists of blackish-red, angular, pea-like grains,\r\npartially soluble in water, almost entirely in spirit of wine of sp.\r\ngr. 0·838, readily in caustic alkaline solutions, and largely in a\r\nsaturated solution of sugar. The liquid kino produces a very inferior\r\narticle on drying. The annual collection of kino in Madras probably\r\ndoes not exceed 1-2 tons. Its approximate London market value is\r\n60-150_s._ a cwt. It is employed medicinally, and in the manufacture\r\nof wines, and might be employed as a source of tannin in dyeing and\r\ntanning, if sufficiently cheap.\r\n\r\n(2) _Butea, Bengal, Palas or Dhak Kino._--This variety is afforded by\r\nthe _palas_ or _dhak_ tree (_Butea frondosa_), common throughout India\r\nand Burma, and affording a dyestuff, and a fibre, as well as by _B.\r\nsuperba_ and _B. parviflora_. During the hot season, there issues from\r\nnatural fissures and from wounds made in the bark of the stem, a red\r\njuice, which quickly hardens to a ruby-coloured, brittle, astringent\r\nmass. It occurs in small drops or tears, and in flat pieces which have\r\nbeen dried on leaves, and is almost always mixed with bark-fragments.\r\nIt is transparent, freely soluble in cold water, and does not soften in\r\nthe mouth. It is unknown in European commerce, but is employed in India\r\nas a substitute for the kind first described.\r\n\r\n(3) _African or Gambia Kino._--This is derived from _Pterocarpus\r\nerinaceus_, a native of Tropical West Africa, from Senegambia to\r\nAngola. The juice exudes naturally from fissures in the bark, but more\r\nabundantly from incisions, and soon coagulates to a blood-red and\r\nvery brittle mass, known to the Portuguese of Angola as _sangue del\r\ndrago_ (\"dragon's-blood\"). It is practically undistinguishable from\r\nthe officinal kind first described, but is not a regular article of\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n(4) _Australian, Botany Bay, or Eucalyptus Kino._--Several species of\r\n_Eucalyptus_ afford astringent extracts, those from the \"red,\" \"white,\"\r\nor \"flooded\" gum (_E. rostrata_), the \"blood-wood\" (_E. corymbosa_),\r\nand _E. citriodora_, being quite suitable for replacing the officinal\r\nkind. It is chiefly obtained by woodcutters, being found in a viscid\r\nstate in flattened cavities in the wood, and soon becoming inspissated,\r\nhard, and brittle. Minor quantities are procured in a liquid state by\r\nincising the bark of living trees, forming a treacly fluid yielding 35\r\nper cent. of solid kino on evaporation. It is imported from Australia,\r\nbut there are no statistics to show in what quantity.\r\n\r\n=Mimosa- or Wattle-bark.=--The bark of numerous species of _Acacia_,\r\nnatives of Australia, contains considerable percentages of deep-red\r\nmimo-tannic acid, which forms a hard and heavy tannage if used strong,\r\nthough soft upper-leathers may be tanned with it in weak liquors. The\r\nchief kinds are as follows:--The common wattle (_Acacia decurrens_),\r\nincluding its variety _A. mollissima_, is known also under the names of\r\ngreen, black, and feathery, but must not be confounded with the silver\r\nwattle (_A. dealbata_), though but doubtfully a distinct species. The\r\nbark is obtainable in vast abundance, and is much used by tanners. The\r\ntrees are stripped in September and the 2 or 3 months following, and\r\nthe bark, being allowed to dry, is then in a marketable condition. This\r\ntree, which grows in the uplands, affords a larger percentage of tannin\r\nthan the silver wattle.\r\n\r\nBlackwood or lightwood (_A. melanoxylon_) yields tanners' bark, which,\r\nis inferior, however, to that from _A. decurrens_. The bark of _A.\r\npenninervis_ yields of tannic acid 17·9 per cent., and of gallic acid\r\n3·8 per cent. The bark of the native hickory (_A. suppurosa_) yields of\r\ntannic acid 6·6 per cent., and of gallic acid 1·2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe bark of _A. saligna_, of South-Western Australia, is much used\r\nby tanners, as it contains nearly 30 per cent. of mimo-tannin. _A.\r\nharpophylla_, of South Queensland, furnishes a considerable share\r\nof the mercantile wattle-bark for tanning purposes. The bark of _A.\r\nlophantha_ contains only about 8 per cent. of tannin.\r\n\r\nThe broad-leaved or golden wattle (_A. pycnantha_), of Victoria and\r\nSouth Australia, deserves extensive cultivation. It is of rapid growth,\r\nwill succeed even in sandy tracts, and yields seed copiously, which\r\ngerminates with the greatest ease. The perfectly-dried bark contains\r\nabout 25 per cent. of tannin. The aqueous infusion of the bark can\r\nbe reduced by boiling to a dry extract, which in medicinal and other\r\nrespects is equal to the best Indian cutch. It yields approximately\r\n30 per cent. of tannin, about half of which, or more, is mimo-tannic\r\nacid. Probably no other tanning plants give so quick a return in\r\ncultivation as the _A. pycnantha_ and _A. decurrens_ of Australia. The\r\nlatter varies in its proportions of tannin from 8 to 33 per cent. In\r\nthe mercantile bark, the percentage is somewhat less, according to the\r\nstate of its dryness, it retaining about 10 per cent. of moisture. The\r\nbark of the silver wattle (_A. dealbata_) is of less value, often even\r\nfetching only half the price of that of the black wattle. The bark\r\nimproves by age and desiccation, and yields 40 per cent. of tannin,\r\nrather more than half of which is tannic acid.\r\n\r\nAmongst all the kinds, the bark of the broad-leaved wattle is\r\nconsidered the most valuable, containing the greatest quantity of\r\ntannin; that of the silver wattle is not so valuable, being deficient\r\nin tannin; the black wattle is considered the most productive species;\r\nit can be barked at 8 years of age, and will produce 40-60 lb. dried\r\nbark, and full-grown trees will yield 100-150 lb. per tree.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of wattles for commercial purposes has till now\r\nremained undeveloped; but no doubt, as soon as it is understood, the\r\nutilisation of many acres of land lying waste, or which have already\r\nbeen exhausted and rendered unfit for the growth of cereals, will\r\nbe effected by the cultivation of the wattle. It requires so little\r\nattention as to make it very profitable, and wattle-growing and grazing\r\ncan be combined satisfactorily. After the first year, when the young\r\ntrees in the plantation have reached the height of 3-4 ft., sheep can\r\nbe turned in.\r\n\r\nWattles grow in almost any soil, even the poorest, but their growth\r\nis most rapid on loose sandy patches, or where the surface has been\r\nbroken for agricultural purposes. When the soil is hard and firm,\r\nplough furrows should be made at a regular distance of 6-8 ft. apart,\r\ninto which the seeds are dropped. The seed should be sown in May,\r\nhaving been previously soaked in hot water, a little below boiling\r\ntemperature, in which they may be allowed to remain for a few hours.\r\nThe seed should be dropped at an average distance of 1 ft. apart along\r\nthe furrow, in which case, about 7200 seeds would suffice for one acre\r\nof land. The seed should not be covered with more than about 1/4 in. of\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nOn loose sandy soil, it might even be unnecessary to break up the\r\nsoil in any way; the furrows may be dispensed with, and the seed sown\r\nbroadcast after the land is harrowed. After the plants have come up,\r\nthey should be thinned so that they stand 6-8 ft. apart. When the\r\nyoung trees have attained the height of 3-4 ft., the lower branches\r\nshould be pruned off, and every effort afterwards made to keep the\r\nstem straight and clear, in order to facilitate the stripping, and\r\ninduce an increased yield of bark. It is advisable that the black and\r\nbroad-leaved should be grown separately, as the black wattle, being\r\nof much larger and quicker growth, would oppress the slower-growing\r\nbroad-leaved one. Care should be taken to replace every tree stripped\r\nby re-sowing, in order that there should be as little variation in the\r\nyield as possible. The months of September-December, in Victoria, are\r\nthose in which the sap rises without intermission, and the bark is\r\ncharged with tannin. Analysis proves that the bark from trees growing\r\non limestone is greatly inferior in tannin to that obtained from other\r\nformations, differing 10-25 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe estimated expenditure on a wattle-bark plantation of 100 acres\r\nduring 8 years is:--\r\n\r\n                                                              £   _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  Rent of 100 acres for 8 years at 6_s._ per acre per annum   240   0    0\r\n  Ploughing 100 acres in drills 10 ft. apart                   25   0    0\r\n  Sowing wattles and actual cultivation, including cost\r\n    of seed                                                    37  10    0\r\n  Supervision for 8 years (nominal), say 10_l._ per annum      80   0    0\r\n  Pruning the trees, taking off useless wood (necessary\r\n    for 2 years), 10_s._ per annum                             50   0    0\r\n  Incidental and unforeseen expenses                           27  10    0\r\n  Interest on the whole amount expended during 8 years        240   0    0\r\n                                                             ─────────────\r\n                                                              700   0    0\r\n  Actual cost of stripping and carting, as shown below       1515   0    0\r\n                                                             ─────────────\r\n                                                            £2215   0    0\r\n                                                             ─────────────\r\n\r\nThe receipts derivable from a wattle plantation of 100 acres,\r\nplanted in the manner proposed, would be:--\r\n\r\n                                                              £   _s._ _d._\r\n\r\n  Each acre planted with wattles, 10 ft. apart, would\r\n    carry 400 trees, and at end of 5th year trees would\r\n    yield say 56 lb. matured bark: stripping only\r\n    every 3rd tree, 332 trees would be obtained off\r\n    100 acres: this, at 4_l._ per ton, would give for\r\n    1st stripping                                            1332   0    0\r\n\r\n  In the 6th or following year, a similar number of\r\n    trees would be stripped: the bark having increased\r\n    in weight (say 14 lb.), the increased yield of 2nd\r\n    stripping would be 400 tons at 4_l._ per ton             1600   0    0\r\n\r\n  In the 7th year, the remaining trees would be\r\n    stripped, from which a still greater increase would\r\n    be obtained, say 480 tons at 4_l._ per ton               1920   0    0\r\n\r\n  Total yield of bark                                        4852   0    0\r\n\r\n  The cost of stripping would not exceed 15_s._ per ton,\r\n    on account of the facilities presented by the\r\n    regularity of the trees, while carting would represent\r\n    another 10_s._ per ton: these combined\r\n    charges would be 25_s._ per ton, and on 1215 tons,\r\n    would be                                                 1515   0    0\r\n                                                             ─────────────\r\n  Leaving a clear profit on the 100 acres of                £2637   0    0\r\n                                                             ─────────────\r\n\r\nThe exports of mimosa-bark in 1876 were 11,899 tons from Victoria,\r\n4758 from South Australia, and 1735 from Tasmania. Later returns are\r\nincluded in barks, p. 39. Shanghai imported 7038 _piculs_ (of 133-1/3\r\nlb.) in 1879. The approximate London market values of mimosa-bark\r\nare:--Ground, 6-13_l._ a ton; chopped, 5-12_l._; long, 5_l._-9_l._\r\n10_s._ A very superior extract has been made from this bark.\r\n\r\n=Myrobalans or Myrabolams.=--The fruits of several species of\r\n_Terminalia_ constitute the myrobalans of commerce; they are chiefly\r\n_T. Chebula_ and _T. Bellerica_, natives of India, the former being\r\na tree 40-50 ft. high, and esteemed for its timber also. The fruits\r\ncontain 30-35 per cent. of gallotannic and ellagitannic acids,\r\nproducing a soft and porous tannage, and good samples giving a\r\nbright-yellow colour. The tannin exists in the pulp, and is absent from\r\nthe very hard \"stone.\" The dried fruits are known locally as _har_,\r\n_harra_, or _bahera_, and are used commonly for dyeing, but not for\r\ntanning.\r\n\r\nOur imports of myrobalans in 1880 were:--238,151 cwt., 121,465_l._,\r\nfrom Bombay and Sind; 115,670 cwt., 51,339_l._, from Madras; 11,020\r\ncwt., 4717_l._, from Bengal and Burma; 3520 cwt., 1402_l._, from other\r\ncountries; total, 368,361 cwt., 178,923_l._ Our re-exports in 1880\r\nwere 8015 cwt., 4328_l._, to Germany; 16,127 cwt., 8515_l._, to other\r\ncountries; total, 24,142 cwt., 12,843_l._ The approximate London market\r\nvalues of myrobalans are 7-14_s._ a cwt. for good, and 5-10_s._ for\r\ncommon. Shanghai imported 4403 _piculs_ (of 133-1/3 lb.) in 1879.\r\n\r\n=Oak-barks= (Fr., _Écorces de Chêne_; Ger., _Eichenrinden_).--The barks\r\nof several species of oak have valuable tanning properties. They are\r\nchiefly:--The common oak (_Quercus Robur_, varieties: _sessiliflora_,\r\nGer. _Traubeneiche_; _pedunculata_, Ger. _Stieleiche_), which is of\r\neven greater importance as a timber-tree; the cork-oak (_Q. Suber_);\r\nthe evergreen oak (_Q. Ilex_); and the American chestnut-oak (_Q.\r\nCastanea_). These barks are among the most esteemed tannins as regards\r\nquality of leather, but are incapable of giving much weight, and from\r\ntheir bulk are costly to handle, containing only 10-12 per cent. of\r\ntannin (quercitannic acid). They give a reddish fawn-coloured leather,\r\nand deposit a good deal of bloom, but yield little or no gallic acid.\r\nThe barks of the cork-oak and evergreen oak from Southern Europe,\r\nare stronger and darker-coloured than English bark. The American\r\nchestnut-oak contains a peculiar fluorescent principle like æsculin.\r\n\r\nOur imports of unspecified barks for tanners' and dyers' use in 1880\r\nwere:--189,399 cwt., 101,108_l._, from Australia; 123,302 cwt.,\r\n32,974_l._, Belgium; 57,232 cwt., 20,988_l._, United States; 22,100\r\ncwt., 6030_l._, Holland; 18,648 cwt., 3676_l._, Italy; 16,151 cwt.,\r\n6972_l._, Algeria; 22,669 cwt., 8838_l._, other countries; total,\r\n449,501 cwt., 180,586_l._ Our imports of unenumerated bark-extracts in\r\nthe same year were valued at:--516,578_l._ from Holland, 92,654_l._\r\nFrance, 30,187_l._ United States, 16,315_l._ British North America,\r\n12,796_l._ Belgium, 13,769_l._ other countries; total, 682,299_l._ Our\r\nre-exports of barks in 1880 were:--19,548 cwt., 10,348_l._, to Germany;\r\n14,627 cwt., 7425_l._, France; 4555 cwt., 3041_l._, Holland; 10,304\r\ncwt., 6080_l._, other countries; total, 49,034 cwt., 26,894_l._\r\n\r\nWith regard to cork-tree bark, James Gordon & Co., Liverpool,\r\nobligingly write that very little comes to England, the great bulk\r\ngoing direct to Ireland, where the consumption is large. The imports\r\nat Liverpool in 1880 were 186 tons, average value 8_l._ per ton. Of\r\noak-bark, Hungary, in 1877, produced 25,000 tons, of which, 20,000\r\nwere exported to Germany for tanning purposes. The approximate London\r\nmarket values of oak-bark are:--English, 12-16_l._ per load of 45 cwt.;\r\nForeign, tree, 5-8_l._ a ton; ditto, coppice, 6-8_l._ In 1879, Algiers\r\nexported 12,660,047 _kilo._ (of 2·2 lb.) of tanning bark.\r\n\r\n=Quebracho.=--The local name _quebracho_, contracted from\r\n_quebra-hacho_ (\"axe-breaker\"), is applied to several South American\r\ntrees possessing hard wood, belonging to distinct genera. They are\r\nchiefly as follows:--(1) _Aspidosperma Quebracho_, the _quebracho\r\nblanco_, a tree growing in the province of Catamarca, Argentine\r\nRepublic; (2) _Loxopterygium_ [_Quebrachia_] _Lorentzii_, the\r\n_quebracho colorado_, most prevalent in the province of Corrientes, the\r\nwood and bark of which come largely into commerce as tanning materials;\r\n(3) _Iodina rhombifolia_, the _quebracho flojo_, whose wood and bark\r\nare mixed with those of No. 2; (4) _Machærium fertile_ [_Tipuana\r\nspeciosa_], the _tipa_, which affords both wood and bark of less\r\ntanning value than No. 2. It would seem that the wood and bark of No.\r\n2 are by far the most largely employed, containing 15-23 per cent. of\r\na bright-red tannin. The wood and an extract from it are imported into\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nFrom information kindly furnished by James Gordon & Co., and Haw &\r\nCo., of Liverpool, it appears that the imports of quebracho-wood into\r\nLiverpool in 1880 were 200 tons, value about 4_l._ 10_s._ a ton; and of\r\nquebracho-bark, about 20 tons, none of which had been sold.\r\n\r\n=Sumach or Shumac= (Fr., _Sumac_; Ger., _Gerbersumach_,\r\n_Schmack_).--The commercial term \"sumach\" is applied to the dried\r\nleaves of a number of South European and American tannin-yielding\r\nplants. These are chiefly as follows:--In Sicily, the European or\r\ntanning-sumach (_Rhus Coriaria_); in Tuscany, _R. Coriaria_, often\r\nadulterated with leaves of _Pistacia lentiscus_; in Spain, several\r\n_Rhus spp._, the products being divided into 3 kinds--Malaga or Priego,\r\nMalina, and Valladolid; in the Tyrol, the smoke-tree or fragrant or\r\nVenetian sumach (_R. Cotinus_); in France, _Coriaria myrtifolia_,\r\ndivided into 4 sorts--_fauvis_, _douzère_, _redoul_ or _redon_, and\r\n_pudis_; in Algeria, Tezera sumach (_R. pentaphylla_), used by the\r\nArabs for making morocco-leather; in North America, the smooth or\r\nwhite sumach (_R. glabra_), the Canadian sumach (_R. canadensis_), the\r\nstaghorn sumach (_R. typhina_), and the dwarf or black sumach (_R.\r\ncopallina_). These are found growing wild in the countries indicated,\r\nand are further subjected to cultivation in some districts, notably\r\nin Sicily. _R. glabra_ and _R. copallina_ are recommended chiefly for\r\nextended cultivation in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe soil usually chosen for cultivation of the plants is poor and\r\nlight; but a much larger crop of leaves can be secured from strong,\r\nrich, deep soils, and it is generally admitted that the product in the\r\nlatter case is also better. In Italy, limestone soils are considered\r\nto be especially suited to this culture, but the American varieties\r\nappear to be well adapted to sandy and clay soils as well. The primary\r\nrequisite in a soil is that it shall be well drained, the presence\r\nof stagnant water about the roots being exceedingly prejudicial. To\r\nprepare the soil for planting, it is ploughed as deeply as possible,\r\nand laid out in rows about 2 ft. apart. In Italy, small holes are made\r\nabout 2 ft. long, 7 in. wide, and 5 in. deep, and a plant is inserted\r\nat each end. A more convenient method would consist in marking the\r\nfield in shallow furrows in one direction 2 ft. apart, and then, with\r\na heavy plough, tolerably deep furrows the same distance apart as, and\r\nat right angles to, the first. A plant may then be placed in the deep\r\nfurrows at each intersection, the furrow again filled with the plough,\r\nand the earth pressed about the plant with the foot. If this were done\r\nin early spring-time, as soon as the earth is sufficiently dry to be\r\nconveniently worked, there can be no doubt that it would be successful,\r\nwhile it would certainly involve little cost. Plants are generally\r\npropagated from the young shoots which form each year about the base of\r\nan older plant, but may also be produced from cuttings made from young\r\nwell-ripened wood, rooted by setting in a nursery or in frames, as in\r\nthe propagation of grape-vines from cuttings. This latter method is\r\nscarcely ever required, however, when the cultivation has been started.\r\nPlants are also raised from seed, and seedlings are always found to\r\nbe strong, vigorous, and thoroughly hardy; but on account of the\r\ngreater time and labour involved in their production, this method of\r\npropagation has not received extended application. The first-mentioned\r\ngenerally gives the quickest, and probably most satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nIn selecting plants from any source, there are certain points to be\r\nobserved:--(1) The shoots should come from young vigorous plants; (2)\r\nthey should be over 1 ft. long; (3) those with large roots and few\r\nrootlets should be rejected; (4) those having white roots, covered with\r\na fibrous, white, silky down, are also to be rejected, this being an\r\nindication of the presence of a very injurious subterranean parasitic\r\nfungus, capable of destroying the entire crop; (5) a good shoot is\r\nstraight, at least 1/2 in. diam., 18 in. long, furnished with numerous\r\nbuds close to each other, root short, but covered with rootlets. Shoots\r\nfor planting may be collected in autumn, after the leaves have fallen,\r\nand be preserved in a nursery until spring; or this may be done in\r\nearly spring, when the ground is very moist and soft. In either case,\r\ncare should be observed that the rootlets are not injured by drying, or\r\nfrom any other cause.\r\n\r\nThe culture to be given the plant is somewhat similar to that required\r\nby Indian corn: the earth about it should be kept tolerably mellow\r\nand free from weeds, and such conditions can probably be maintained\r\nto a degree sufficient for sumach, by working several times during\r\nthe growing season with a cultivator, and passing through the rows\r\noccasionally with a plough. All this work is not absolutely necessary\r\nto the life of the plant, but its vigour, and consequently its yield in\r\nleaves, may be considerably increased and strengthened thereby. After\r\nthe first year, the number of operations may be diminished, but they\r\nshould always be sufficient to keep the ground free from weeds and\r\ngrass.\r\n\r\nShortly after planting, and when the plant is well set, the stock is\r\npruned to a length of 6-8 in., when the plant is left to assume any\r\nform, and is no further pruned except by the process of collecting the\r\nleaves, unless hand-picking is resorted to; in such case, after the 2nd\r\nyear, pruning takes place each year in the fall or winter, the plant\r\nbeing reduced to a height of 6-10 in. After the 3rd year, the plant\r\nbegins to produce the shoots from about its base, already mentioned;\r\nthese, if not needed for new plantations, should be removed each year,\r\nfor if left to develop, they weaken the plant. If not removed during\r\nthe summer, the operation should without fail be effected during the\r\nfall or winter.\r\n\r\nThe 1st crop of leaves may be secured during the year following that\r\nof planting. This develops and matures somewhat later than that from\r\nolder plants, and in Italy it is not collected until the end of August\r\nor the 1st of September; but there are reasons for believing that in\r\nthe United States, especially in the Northern States, the collection of\r\nleaves from native varieties should be made much earlier, because the\r\nsummer is much shorter, and the habits of the varieties grown differ\r\nfrom the Sicilian. Macagno has shown (Chem. Soc. Journ., xxxviii., p.\r\n733) that the leaves from the upper side of the branches contain much\r\nmore tannin than those below, and that especially in the lower leaves\r\nthe percentage of tannin is much higher in June than in August. All\r\nthe leaves, except the young and tender ones of the extremities of the\r\nbranches, are stripped off and placed in baskets, in which they are\r\ncarried to a threshing-floor, where they are spread out in thin layers\r\nto dry. Here they must be frequently stirred and turned over, for which\r\npurpose a fork with wooden prongs is employed. In the fall, when growth\r\nis finished, and before the leaves have had time to become red, those\r\nremaining on the extremities are collected. To this end, the branches\r\nare broken just below the tuft of leaves, and the latter are allowed\r\nto remain suspended from the branch by a piece of bark not detached,\r\nand left in this condition until nearly or quite dry. They are then\r\ncollected and treated in the same manner as other leaves, but the\r\nproduct obtained in this way is always of inferior quality.\r\n\r\nAfter the 2nd year, crops of larger quantity and superior quality are\r\nobtained, and the collection is made in a different way, and much\r\nmore frequently. The two methods followed in Sicily are (1) pruning,\r\nand (2) defoliation. The first, which is the more ancient, but much\r\nless costly, requires less care, and is simple and rapid; but it is\r\ninjurious to the future condition of the plant, and the quantity of\r\nsubsequent crops. The second, though slower, serves to better maintain\r\nthe vigour of the plant, and the uniform quantity of the crop from\r\nyear to year; in consequence, it reduces the necessity for frequent\r\nrenewal of stocks.\r\n\r\nHarvest by pruning is carried on in Italy as follows. During May,\r\nthe lower leaves, which, from greater age, appear to have attained\r\nfull maturity, and may be in danger of loss from falling, are removed\r\nin the same manner as described for collecting the leaves from\r\nyearling plants. Toward the end of June, and during the course of\r\nJuly, all branches bearing leaves are cut away, reducing the plant\r\nto the principal stock: by this means, the crop is harvested and the\r\nplant is pruned at the same time. But even in Sicily, the time for\r\nthis operation is limited to no absolute period, and varies with\r\nthe development of the leaf, as indicated by cessation of growth\r\nand increase in size. In this condition, also, the leaves will have\r\nacquired their deepest green colour, and attained their maximum weight\r\nand best quality. It is further stated that while this time varies\r\naccording to locality, about Palermo it is never earlier than June nor\r\nlater than July. The harvest by pruning must always be made by men\r\naccustomed to the work, and equal to the exertion required. Provided\r\nwith a pruning-bill, they cut off all leaf-bearing branches, collecting\r\nthem an the left arm, until each has cut as much as he can conveniently\r\ncarry, when he places the armful on the ground with the butts in the\r\ndirection of the prevailing wind, which, if tolerably strong, might\r\ncarry away some of the leaves if turned in the opposite direction;\r\nfinally, he presses down the branches with his foot, to make the heap\r\nmore compact, and leave less surface exposed to the wind and sun.\r\nAnother labourer deposits a second armful in the same place, presses it\r\nwith his foot in like manner, and the two deposits constitute a bundle.\r\nAt the close of the operation, there remain the young shoots which are\r\nformed about the base of the plant, the leaves of which are not fully\r\ndeveloped, and consequently not fit for collection until at least 20\r\ndays later. After this time, they are removed by hand, care being\r\nobserved not to injure the buds, especially if the shoots are to be\r\nused for stocks in the formation of plantations in the following year.\r\n\r\nDefoliation, or collection by hand, is carried on whenever the leaf\r\nmay be fully developed and ripe, beginning at first with the lower\r\nleaves, and continuing eventually to the ends of the branches. It takes\r\nplace at 3 different times during the season: the 1st in May, the 2nd\r\nlate in July or early August, and the 3rd in September. At the last\r\ncollection, the extremities of the branches are broken down, and the\r\nleaves are allowed to dry before removal from the plant, as described\r\nunder collections of the 2nd year. In the application of this method,\r\nthe regular pruning is effected during the fall or winter, when the\r\nplant is dormant, and under such conditions the operation becomes a\r\nregenerative one, giving in this particular an advantage over the other\r\nmethod, in which the pruning is effected in the summer when the plant\r\nis in full vegetative activity, and so has a strongly deteriorating\r\ninfluence. In both methods of pruning, care should be observed to leave\r\na long slanting section, upon which water will be less likely to settle\r\nand promote decay.\r\n\r\nThe leaves collected by either method are dried in the open field where\r\nthey have grown, and when dried, are carried to a threshing-floor to\r\nbe beaten, or at once to the threshing-floor and dried there. In the\r\nformer, the operation is rather more rapid, but there is greater danger\r\nof injury by rain, the effect of which is very deleterious, especially\r\nif it fall upon the leaves when they are partially dried. The damage\r\nresulting from this cause is less if the leaves are not lying upon the\r\nground, and are so arranged that the air may circulate freely about\r\nand under them. In the pruning method, the leaves are dried upon the\r\nbranches and in the heaps where they are first deposited. Sometimes\r\nthey are turned, but generally it is considered better not to disturb\r\nthem until completely dried, and ready for transportation to the\r\nthreshing-floor. In this way, they are protected to a greater extent\r\nfrom the action of direct sunlight, which is said to be injurious to\r\nthe quality of the product. When the leaves are collected by hand,\r\nthey are dried upon the threshing-floor, where they are spread in\r\nthin layers, and stirred 3-4 times a day. They are then beaten with a\r\nflail to separate the leaves from the branches and stems. If this be\r\ndone during the middle of the day, when the leaves are most thoroughly\r\ndry and consequently brittle, they are reduced to small particles,\r\nproducing what is called \"sumach for grinding.\" But if it be done in\r\nthe morning, or on damp days, when the air is charged with moisture and\r\nthe leaves are tough, they are separated from the stems more nearly\r\nentire and less broken, and the product obtained is called \"sumach for\r\nbaling.\" The stems remaining after the separation of sumach for baling\r\nstill retain small particles of leaves attached to them, and they are\r\ntherefore again beaten when perfectly dry for the production of a\r\nlow-grade sumach, called by the Italians _gammuzza_. The products are\r\nclassed as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                 Relative Market\r\n                                      Value.\r\n\r\n  Sumach for baling                    2·5\r\n    \"     \"  grinding                  2·3\r\n    \"    from yearling plants          1·5\r\n    \"     \"   ends of branches      }\r\n                collected in autumn }  1·0\r\n\r\nTo prepare these different grades for ultimate consumption, they are\r\nground in mills similar to those employed for crushing olives, that\r\nis, in which two large stone wheels follow each other, revolving upon\r\na circular bed, the whole construction being about the same as the\r\nSpanish or Mexican _arrastre_. The sumach thus pulverised is passed\r\nthrough bolting-screens, to separate the finer from the coarser\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia, the leaves are collected and cured by the country\r\npeople, and sold and delivered to owners of mills for grinding. Their\r\nparticular object being to secure the largest possible quantity of\r\nproduct at the lowest cost, little attention is given to the quality\r\nobtained, or the manner of collecting. The most intelligent dealers\r\nin the raw material urge upon collectors to observe the following\r\nparticulars:--The leaf should be taken when full of sap, before it\r\nhas turned red, has begun to wither, or has been affected by frost, to\r\nensure a maximum value for tanning purposes. Either the leaf-bearing\r\nstems may be stripped off, or the entire stalk may be cut away, and\r\nthe leaves upon it allowed to wither before being carried to the\r\ndrying-shed; but care must be observed that they are neither scorched\r\nnor bleached by the sun. When wilted, they are carried to a covered\r\nplace, and spread upon open shelving or racks to dry, avoiding the\r\ndeposit in any one place of a quantity so great as to endanger the\r\nquality of the product by overheating and fermentation. Sumach should\r\nbe allowed to remain within the drying-house at least one month before\r\nsending to the market; in case of bad weather, a longer period may be\r\nrequired. When ready for packing for shipment, it should be perfectly\r\ndry and very brittle, otherwise it is likely to suffer injury in\r\nwarehouses from heating and fermentation.\r\n\r\nBuyers of sumach leaves for grinding depend largely upon colour for\r\nthe determination of the value; the leaves should, therefore, when\r\nready for market, present a bright-green colour, which is evidence that\r\nthey have suffered neither from rain after being gathered, nor from\r\nheating during the process of drying. Leaves having a mouldy odour or\r\nappearance are rejected. The Virginian crop reaches 7000-8000 tons, and\r\nis collected at any time between July 1 and the appearance of frost.\r\n\r\nThere is an important difference in the value of the European and\r\nAmerican products. The proportion of tannic acid in the latter\r\nexceeds that found in the former by 6-8 per cent., yet the former is\r\nmuch preferred by tanners and dyers. By using Sicilian sumach it is\r\npossible to make the finer white leathers, in great demand for gloves\r\nand fancy shoes; while by the employment of the American product, the\r\nleather has a disagreeable yellow or dark colour, apparently due to a\r\ncolouring matter, which, according to Loewe, consists of quercitrin and\r\nquercetin, and exists in larger quantity in the American than in the\r\nSicilian.\r\n\r\nThe experimental results obtained by collecting sumach at different\r\nseasons were:--\r\n\r\n                                               Per Cent. of\r\n                                               Tannic Acid.\r\n\r\n  Virginia, mixed,   collected in June, gave      22·75\r\n     \"        \"           \"       July,           27·38\r\n     \"      _R. glabra_    \"      August, \"       23·56\r\n     \"      _B. copallina_ \"        \"     \"       16·99\r\n  Sicilian, _B. Coriaria_  \"        \"     \"       24·27\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that in order to secure the maximum amount of\r\ntannic acid, the sumach should be collected in July, but the colouring\r\nmatter of the leaves has an important influence upon the value of the\r\nproduct. The leaves of the upper extremities of the stalks are always\r\nricher in tannic acid than those of the base; and the increase of age\r\nof the plant is accompanied by a general diminution of this acid. Yet\r\nthe collection of the crop should be delayed as long as possible,\r\nbecause the diminution of tannin in the leaves will be abundantly\r\ncompensated for by the quality of the product.\r\n\r\nExperiments upon the presence of colouring matters were made by\r\ntreating gelatine solutions, and gave the following results:--\r\n\r\n  Virginia, mixed,   collected in June, gave   A nearly white precipitate.\r\n     \"        \"             \"     July,  \"     A decidedly yellowish-white\r\n                                                 precipitate.\r\n     \"      _R. copallina_, \"     August \"     A dirty-yellow precipitate.\r\n     \"      _B. glabra_,    \"       \"    \"     A very dirty-white\r\n                                                 precipitate.\r\n  Fredericksburg mixed,     \"       \"    \"     A dirty-yellow precipitate.\r\n  Sicilian                  \"       \"    \"     A slightly yellowish-white\r\n                                                 precipitate.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore advised that for the purpose of tanning white and\r\ndelicately-coloured leathers, the collection should be made in\r\nJune; while for tanning dark-coloured leathers, and for dyeing and\r\ncalico-printing in dark colours, where the slightly yellow colour will\r\nhave no injurious effect, the collection be made in July. It appears\r\nthat for all purposes, the sumach collected after the 1st of August is\r\ninferior in quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nFig. 8 shows a mill for grinding sumach-leaves; it consists of a heavy\r\nsolid circular wooden bed _a_, 15 ft. diam., with a depression around\r\nthe edge _b_, a few inches deep and 1 ft. wide, for the reception\r\nof the ground sumach from the bed, and 2 edge-rollers _c_, weighing\r\nabout 2500 lb. each, 5-6 ft. diam., and provided with numerous teeth\r\nof iron or wood, thickly inserted. Most mills have to be stopped to\r\nallow the unloading of the bed, but this delay is obviated by an\r\napparatus consisting of an angular arm _d_, attached to a scraper _e_,\r\nand worked by a lever _f_, which passes through the hollow shaft _g_\r\nand extends to the room above, where it terminates in a handle _h_.\r\nThe scraper carries the ground sumach to the opening _i_, whence it is\r\ntaken by an elevator to a revolving sieve or screen in a room above.\r\nAfter screening, the sumach is packed in bags, 15 to the ton, being\r\nalways sold by that weight. The chasers and beds are inclosed in a\r\ncase or drum, and the grinding is done by the application of power to\r\nthe upright shaft _g_. The mills are fed from above. The packing is\r\nsometimes done by machinery alone. The best mills cost about 600_l._\r\nIn Europe, and in some parts of the Southern States, sumach is still\r\nground by stones revolving on a stone bed, and the sifting is often\r\ndone by hand.\r\n\r\nE. Coez & Co., St. Denis, near Paris, make a sumach extract. It is\r\nconcentrated to a syrupy consistence in a vacuum-pan, and keeps\r\nwell, exhibiting none of the acidity which is manifested by a simple\r\ndecoction of sumach leaves. Sumach contains 16-24 per cent. of\r\ngallotannic acid, and is somewhat similar in tanning properties to\r\nmyrobalans, but paler in colour. It is principally used for tanning\r\nmorocco and other fancy leathers.\r\n\r\nThe district of Ancona yields 200 tons per annum of sumach, said to be\r\nequal to and cheaper than the Sicilian, but mostly consumed locally.\r\nPalermo exported of \"ventilated\" sumach to the United States 120,043\r\nbags (14 = 1 ton) in 1877, and 50,085 in 1878, the average value being\r\n14_l._ a ton. Trieste exported 7800 cwt. by land in 1877; in 1878,\r\nthe shipments to England were 16,600 _kilo._ (of 2·2 lb.), value 1328\r\nfl. (of 2_s._), and in 1880, 91,800 _kilo._ 7344 fl. Rustchuk in 1880\r\nexported 1400 tons, chiefly to Roumania and Austria. Our imports\r\nin 1880 were 10,573 tons, 133,249_l._ from Italy, and 1047 tons,\r\n12,416_l._, from other countries; total, 11,620 tons, 145,665_l._ The\r\napproximate London market value is 15_s._-16_s._ 6_d._ a cwt. for\r\nSicilian, 10-11_s._ for Spanish.\r\n\r\n=Valonia= (Fr., _Vélanèdes_; Ger., _Valonia_). This is the commercial\r\nname for the large pericarps or acorn-cups of several species or\r\nvarieties of oak, chiefly _Quercus Ægilops_ and _Q. macrolepis_. The\r\nformer is found growing in the highlands of the Morea, Roumelia,\r\nthe Greek Archipelago, Asia Minor, and Palestine; the latter\r\nconstitutes vast forests in many parts of Greece, and especially on\r\nthe lower slopes of Taygetos, towards Ætylon and Mani (Laconia). Prof.\r\nOrphanides, of Athens, alludes to a third species or variety called\r\n_porto galussa_, which yields a superior kind of valonia, and named\r\nby him _Q. stenophylla_. The chief localities of production in Asia\r\nMinor are Ushak, Borlo, Demirdji, Ghiördes, Adala, Nazlü, Buldur,\r\nSokia, Balat, Troja, Aivalik, and Mytilene. The annual exports,\r\nmainly from Smyrna, reach 600,000 _quintals_ (of 2 cwt.), value about\r\n400,000_l._ In Greece, the production is chiefly centred in the\r\nfollowing districts: (1) The province of Lacedemonia, which afforded\r\n10,000 cwt. in 1872; (2) the province of Gythium, in the lower part of\r\nMount Taygetos, which gave 60,000 cwt. in 1872; (3) the island of Zea,\r\nwhich formerly yielded 30,000-40,000 cwt., lately reduced to 15,000\r\ncwt. yearly; (4) Attica, especially the neighbourhood of Cacossalessi,\r\ngrows 3000-5000 cwt., shipped from Oropos, in the Strait of Chalcis;\r\n(5) the island of Eubœa, whence about 1000 cwt. are shipped annually\r\nat Bouffalo; (6) the province of Triphyllia raises 3000 cwt., which go\r\nto Trieste, viâ Cyparissie; (7) the province of Pulos, especially the\r\ncommune of Ligudista, grows over 2000 cwt., despatched from Navarino to\r\nTrieste; (8) the province of Achaia has a yearly crop of 30,000-40,000\r\ncwt., shipped to Trieste from Courupeli and Caravostassi, between\r\nPatras and Cape Papa; (9) the small towns of Anatolico and Astakos\r\n(Dragomestre) collect the valonia of the eastern parts of Ætylon,\r\nAcarnania, and Cravassaras (a port in the Gulf of Arta), and of all\r\nthe other western parts, to be sent to Trieste for shipment to England\r\nand Italy. Ætolia and Acarnania furnish abundant crops, that of 1872\r\nexceeding 100,000 cwt. The total area of the Greek valonia-yielding\r\nforests is said to be about 13,000 _stremme_ (of 119-1/2 sq. yd.). The\r\ntotal production in 1877 was estimated at 2,601,000 _quintals_ (of\r\n2 cwt.); the greater part is exported, about 2/3 going to Austria,\r\nand the rest to Italy and England. The proportions of tannic acid in\r\nthe valonia from different districts of Greece are said to vary as\r\nfollows: Patras, 19-28-1/2 per cent.; Gythium, 27-1/4-35-1/2; Zea,\r\n12-1/4-25-1/4; Vonitza, 18-20.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey, the fruit ripens in July-August, when the trees are beaten,\r\nand the fallen acorns left on the ground to dry. The natives afterwards\r\ngather them, and transport them on camel-back to stores in the towns,\r\nwhence they go by camel and train to Smyrna, and are there placed in\r\nheaps 5-6 ft. deep in large airy stores for some weeks, during which\r\nthe mass heats, and the acorn itself, which contains but little tannin,\r\nand is used for feeding pigs, contracts and falls from the cup. This\r\nincipient fermentation is attended with considerable risk; if carried\r\ntoo far, a large proportion of the valonia becomes dark-coloured and\r\notherwise damaged. When ready for shipment, the heaps are hand-picked,\r\nthe best being reserved for the Austrian market (Trieste), and the rest\r\ngoing to England. In some cases, the rubbish having been removed, the\r\nremainder is known as \"natural,\" and is thus exported to England.\r\n\r\nIn Greek commerce, three qualities are distinguished, _chamada_,\r\n_rhabdisto_, and _charcala_. The _chamada_ (_camata_ and _camatina_\r\nof Asia Minor) is the best; it is collected in April, before the\r\nacorn is matured, hence the cup which encloses the acorn is small and\r\nincompletely developed. The _rhabdisto_ is the second quality; it is\r\ncollected in September-October, and is distinguished by the fruit being\r\nlarger and riper; the name means \"beaten,\" the fruits being beaten\r\ndown from the trees with sticks. After mid-October the collection\r\nceases, because the first rains cause the fallen fruit to ferment\r\nor turn black, and they then take the name of _charchala_. They are\r\ndistinguished by the cups being completely open, and containing no\r\nacorns. They are considered much inferior, possessing little tannin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pl. IV.\r\n\r\n_E & F. N. Spon, London &. New York._\r\n\r\n\"INK PHOTO\". SPRAGUE & CO LONDON\r\n\r\nREVOLVING, WASHING AND PRESSING MACHINES.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the acorn cup is attacked by a kind of honey-dew, which\r\ndeposits on the cup, and makes it very liable to heat when gathered,\r\nthe cup becoming very dark and deficient in tannin. The Turkish crop of\r\n1875 was much damaged from this cause, many parcels reaching England in\r\nan unsaleable condition. The cause of the disease is yet unknown; it\r\nseems specially prevalent when the crop is large and the acorn fully\r\ndeveloped. A good sample of valonia should be composed of medium-sized\r\ncups, with the rim or wall very thick, and the exterior spines small\r\nand uniform. The cut or broken cup should show a bright-drab fractured\r\nsurface. Valonia contains 25-35 per cent. of a tannin somewhat\r\nresembling that of oak-bark, but giving a browner colour and heavier\r\nbloom. It makes a hard and heavy leather, and is generally used in\r\nadmixture with oak-bark, myrobalans, or mimosa-bark.\r\n\r\nThe Greek crop in 1880 was much damaged by the cold spring: It gave\r\n600 tons in Acarnania and Ætolia, 650 in Cape Papa, and 1400 in Mania;\r\ntotal, 2650 tons. Calamata and Messenia produced 115 tons, 1700_l._\r\nSyra exported in 1879, 1174_l._ worth to Great Britain, 348_l._\r\nAustria, 259_l._ Russia, 250_l._ Turkey, 178_l._ Egypt. Hungary\r\nexported 942 tons in 1880. Adana shipped 9450_l._ worth in 1878; and\r\nDedeagatch, in the same year, 1,500,000 lb., 9000_l._ Musyna [Mersineh]\r\nsent 670 tons, 3350_l._, to Italy, and 450 tons, 2250_l._ to Austria,\r\nin 1879; and 480 tons, 2240_l._, to Italy, and 128 tons, 640_l._, to\r\nGreece, in 1880. Our imports in 1880 were:--From Turkey, 30,391 tons,\r\n471,637_l._; Greece, 2916 tons, 41,312_l._; other countries, 466 tons,\r\n7105_l._; total, 33,773 tons, 520,054_l._ The approximate London\r\nmarket values are:--Smyrna, 12_s._ 6_d._-20_s._ 6_d._ a cwt.; Camata,\r\n15_s._-19_s._; Morea, 10_s._ 6_d._-18_s._\r\n\r\n=Miscellaneous.=--Besides the foregoing tannins, which already occupy\r\nprominent places in European and American commerce, there are many\r\nothers as yet of minor importance, but possessing qualities which may\r\nbring them into note in the near future. They are as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Abies Larix_ bark, the larch, contains 6-8 per cent. of a red tannin.\r\n\r\n_Acacia albicans_ fruits, the _hiusache_ of Mexico, are used as\r\nsubstitutes for gall-nuts, costing locally about 5_d._ a lb. _A.\r\narabica_, the _babul_ of India, yields a tannin which gives a nearly\r\npure-white precipitate with gelatine: the proportions are 12·55 per\r\ncent, in trunk-bark, 18·95 in branch-bark, 15·45 in twig-bark. The\r\nsupply is unlimited. It works well with myrobalans. _A. Cebil_, the red\r\ncebil of the Argentine Republic, contains 10-15 per cent. of tannin in\r\nthe bark, and 6-7 per cent. in the leaves; another variety, the white\r\ncebil, contains 8-12 per cent. in the bark, and 7-8 per cent. in the\r\nleaves. _A. Cavenia_, the _espinillo_ of the Argentine Republic, has\r\n33-34 per cent. of tannin in the fruit-husks. _A. penninervis_ bark,\r\nthe \"hardy\" acacia of Australia, contains 18 per cent. of tannic acid\r\nand 3-4 of gallic.\r\n\r\n_Alnus glutinosa_ bark, the common alder, contains about 16 per cent.\r\nof tannin.\r\n\r\n_Cœsalpinia Cacalaco_ fruits, the _cascalote_ of Mexico, are very rich\r\nin tannic and gallic acids, and are locally used for tanning.\r\n\r\n_Comptonia asplenifolia_ leaves, the sweet-fern of the United States,\r\ncontain 9-10 per cent. of tannin.\r\n\r\n_Coriaria ruscifolia_ bark, the _tutu_ of New Zealand, contains 16-17\r\nper cent. of tannin.\r\n\r\n_Elæocarpus dentatus_ bark, the _kiri-hinau_ of New Zealand, contains\r\n21-22 per cent. of tannin. _E. Hookerianus_ bark, the _pokako_ of New\r\nZealand, contains 9-10 per cent. of tannin.\r\n\r\n_Ephedra antisyphilitica_, on the tablelands of Arizona and Utah, gives\r\n11-12 per cent. of tannin.\r\n\r\n_Eucalyptus longifolia_ bark, the \"woolly-butt\" of Australia, contains\r\n8·3 per cent. of tannic acid, and 2·8 of gallic. The \"peppermint\"-tree\r\ncontains 20 per cent. of tannic acid in its bark. The \"stringy-bark\"\r\n(_E. obliqua_) gives 13-1/2 per cent. of kinotannic acid. The Victorian\r\n\"iron-bark\" (_E. leucoxylon_) contains 22 per cent. of kinotannic acid,\r\nbut is available only for inferior leather.\r\n\r\n_Eugenia Maire_ bark, the _whawhako_ of New Zealand, contains 16-17 per\r\ncent. of tannin. _E. Smithii_ bark, the \"myrtle\"-tree of Australia,\r\ncontains 17 per cent. of tannic acid and 3-4 of gallic.\r\n\r\n_Fuchsia macrostemma_ root-bark is thin, brittle, and easily exhausted;\r\nit contains about 25 per cent. of a bright-red tannin, which has been\r\nsuccessfully tried. It is the _churco_ bark of Chili, which, however,\r\nis attributed by the Kew authorities to _Oxalis gigantea_.\r\n\r\n_Inga Feuillei_ pods, the _pay-pay_ of Peru, contain 24 per cent. of an\r\nalmost colourless tannin.\r\n\r\n_Laurus Peumo_ rind is used in Chili for tanning uppers.\r\n\r\n_Malpighia punicifolia_ bark, the _naucite_, or _manquitta_ bark of\r\nNicaragua, contains 20-30 per cent. of a very light-coloured tannin.\r\n\r\n_Persea Lingue_ bark is red-brown, soft, and easily exhausted by\r\nwater; it contains 20-24 per cent. of tannin, and much slimy matter\r\nwhich promotes the swelling of the hides. It serves in South America,\r\nespecially in the Chilian province of Valdivia, for tanning Valdivia\r\nleather. In Southern Chili are enormous forests of the tree.

By virtue of this power, they convert animal hide into the\r\ninsoluble and imputrescible material called \"leather.\" They are\r\nmostly uncrystallisable; and all form blackish-blue or blackish-green\r\ncompounds with ferric salts, and in common with many other organic\r\nsubstances are precipitated by lead and copper acetates, stannous\r\nchloride, and many other metallic salts, and those of organic bases,\r\nsuch as quinine. In some cases, the tannin combines with the base\r\nonly, liberating the acid; but frequently the salt as a whole enters\r\ninto combination. This is the case with the precipitates formed with\r\nlead and copper acetates. With alkalies, the tannins and many of their\r\nderivatives give solutions which oxidise and darken rapidly, usually\r\nbecoming successively orange, brown, and black. A. H. Allen has shown\r\nthat these bodies also give instantaneously a deep-red coloration with\r\na solution of potassium ferricyanide and ammonia. The reaction is one\r\nof considerable delicacy.\r\n\r\nTannins are more or less soluble in water; and freely so in alcohol,\r\nmixtures of alcohol and ether, and ethyl acetate, but scarcely in dry\r\nether alone, nor in dilute sulphuric acid; and insoluble in carbon\r\ndisulphide, petroleum spirit, benzene, and chloroform.\r\n\r\nFrom their amorphous character, tannins are extremely difficult to\r\npurify; and when, as is frequently the case, two or more tannins occur\r\nin the same plant, it is often quite impossible completely to separate\r\nthem. Owing to their considerable differences in character, no general\r\nmethod of purification can be given, but the following processes will\r\nbe found in many cases to give good results. For the special methods\r\nadopted by different investigators, the original memoirs must be\r\nconsulted, references to many of which will be found in the following\r\npages.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreparation and Purification of Tannins.\r\n\r\nThe oldest method of separating tannins from other constituents is\r\nthat applied by Pelouze to the preparation of commercial gallotannic\r\nacid from gall-nuts. The finely pulverised material is placed in a\r\npercolator and exhausted with commercial ether containing water and\r\nalcohol. The liquid separates, on standing, into 2 layers of which the\r\nlower contains most of the tannin in a tolerably pure form, dissolved\r\nin water and alcohol with a little ether, while the upper mainly\r\nethereous layer contains the gallic acid. Gall-nuts thus treated yield\r\n35-40 per cent. of tannin. If equal parts of ether and 90 per cent.\r\nalcohol are used, a larger yield is obtained, but the liquid does not\r\nseparate into 2 layers, and it is questionable if the product is so\r\npure. For Chinese galls, washed ether acts better than ether alcohol.\r\nThe tannin may be still further purified by dissolving in a mixture of\r\n1 part water with 2 of ether, when 3 layers are formed, of which the\r\nlowest contains nearly pure tannin.\r\n\r\nThese methods are applicable to the dried or highly concentrated\r\nextracts of many tanning materials. Many tannins may be separated from\r\ntheir strong aqueous solution in a state of considerable purity by\r\nfirst agitating with ether to remove gallic acid, and then saturating\r\nwith common salt, and shaking well with acetic ether, which takes\r\nup the tannin. Another method is to extract with alcohol, evaporate\r\nto a small bulk at as low a temperature as possible, and treat at\r\nonce with a considerable quantity of cold water. The infusion is\r\nthen precipitated with successive small quantities of lead acetate;\r\nthe first and last portions of the precipitate are filtered off and\r\nrejected as contaminated with colouring matters and other impurities,\r\nwhile the remainder, after rapid washing, is suspended in water and\r\ndecomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen. The filtrate is shaken with\r\nether to remove gallic acid, and the aqueous portion is evaporated at\r\na low temperature in a partial vacuum to a thin syrup, and the drying\r\ncompleted over sulphuric acid in vacuo.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe natural tannins are all compounds of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen\r\nonly. They all contain the benzene group of carbon atoms, but their\r\nultimate structure is, except in the case of gallotannic acid, very\r\nimperfectly understood, and probably differs considerably in type in\r\ndifferent members of the family.\r\n\r\nIn order to make clear to those readers who have not studied modern\r\norganic chemistry, what we do know on the subject, a few words of\r\nintroduction will be necessary. All organic compounds contain carbon,\r\nin combination with hydrogen, and very frequently also with oxygen,\r\nnitrogen, and other elements. A single atom of carbon is able to\r\ncombine with 4 atoms of hydrogen, as it does to form marsh gas, or\r\nmethyl hydride, CH_{4}. Other elements may be substituted for the\r\nhydrogen; for instance, if we replace 3 of the hydrogen atoms with\r\nchlorine, we obtain chloroform, CHCl_{3}. Again an atom of oxygen may\r\nbe inserted between the carbon atom and one of the hydrogen atoms,\r\nproducing methyl hydroxide or wood spirit. The group CH_{3} is called\r\nmethyl, and we may substitute in wood spirit this entire methyl group\r\nfor one of the atoms of hydrogen, when we shall have ordinary alcohol,\r\nC_{2}H_{5}OH. This building-up process may be repeated almost _ad\r\ninfinitum_, producing a whole series of alcohols of higher and higher\r\nboiling point as the atoms of carbon become more numerous. Again, if\r\nin wood spirit we substitute an atom of oxygen for 2 of the remaining\r\natoms of hydrogen we obtain formic acid, CHO.OH, the first of a long\r\nseries of acids, of which the second, corresponding to ordinary\r\nalcohol, is acetic acid, and the highest members, such as stearic acid,\r\nC_{18}H_{35}O.OH, are solid fats. Hence the whole series are commonly\r\ncalled the fatty acids. A few structural formulæ will serve to make\r\nthese points clearer, but it may be well to say that such formulæ must\r\nbe taken simply as indicating the order in which the different atoms\r\nare united, and in no sense their actual position in space. The atoms\r\nin a molecule are held together by attractions and are in continual\r\nmotion, so that they are more comparable to the planets of the solar\r\nsystem than to a rigid shape.\r\n\r\n  _Methyl Hydride._  _Methyl Alcohol._  _Common Alcohol._\r\n\r\n        H                H                  H  H\r\n        │                │                  │  │\r\n     H──C──H          H──C──O──H         H──C──C──O──H\r\n        │                │                  │  │\r\n        H                H                  H  H\r\n\r\n  _Chloroform._      _Formic Acid._      _Acetic Acid._\r\n\r\n        Cl               O                  H  O\r\n        │                ║                  │  ║\r\n     H──C──Cl         H──C──O──H         H──C──C──O──H\r\n        │                │\r\n        Cl               H\r\n\r\nIn benzene, C_{6}H_{6} we have a compound of another type.\r\nThere is reason to think that the carbon atoms in this case\r\nare united in a ring, as shown,\r\n\r\n  H  H  H\r\n  │  │  │\r\n  C──C══C\r\n  ║     │\r\n  C──C══C\r\n  │  │  │\r\n  H  H  H\r\n\r\nThis benzene group forms the foundation of an immense number of bodies\r\nknown as the aromatic series, to which belong aniline, carbolic acid,\r\npicric acid, gallic acid, and a host of other compounds important alike\r\nin a scientific and commercial sense, and among which we may pretty\r\nsafely group the whole of the tannins. Commencing with benzene, we may,\r\nby inserting atoms of oxygen, produce a series of alcohols or phenols,\r\nof which common phenol (usually but incorrectly called carbolic acid)\r\nis the first.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives a general view of some of these, so far as\r\nthey are known, with their corresponding acids:--\r\n\r\n  ──────────────┬─────────────────┬────────────────────┬───────────────────\r\n    C_{6}H_{6}  │  C_{6}H_{5}OH   │ C_{6}H_{4}(OH)_{2} │ C_{6}H_{3}(OH)_{3}\r\n    Benzene.    │     Phenol.     │    Pyrocatechol    │    Pyrogallol,\r\n                │                 │   (or catechol),   │   Phloroglucol.\r\n                │                 │    Hydroquinol,    │\r\n                │                 │    Resorcinol.     │\r\n  ──────────────┼─────────────────┼────────────────────┼───────────────────\r\n        {H_{5}  │      {H_{4}     │      {H_{3}        │      {H_{2}\r\n   C_{6}{CO.OH  │ C_{6}{OH        │ C_{6}{(OH)_{2}     │ C_{6}{(OH)_{2}\r\n                │      {CO.OH     │      {CO.OH        │      {CO.OH\r\n   Benzoic acid.│ Salycylic acid, │ Protocatechuic acid│ Gallic acid,\r\n                │ Oxybenzoic acid.│   (and 5 other     │     &c.\r\n                │                 │  isomeric acids).  │\r\n  ──────────────┴─────────────────┴────────────────────┴───────────────────\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that a large proportion of the formulæ given above\r\nrepresent several compounds identical in composition, but frequently\r\nvery distinct in their properties. The explanation of these differences\r\nlies in the different relative position of the OH and CO.OH groups\r\nround the benzene ring. Thus the following diagram represents the\r\nrelative positions of the pyrocatechol series. It may be noted that\r\neach phenol yields two isomeric[E] acids. Miller (C. S. Jour., xli.\r\n398), who has investigated these acids, remarks, \"Of the 3 phenols\r\nC_{6}H_{4}OH_{2}, catechol alone gives a precipitate with lead acetate,\r\nand of the 6 acids, C_{6}N_{5}OH_{2}, CO.OH, none yields precipitates\r\nwith lead acetate, except the 2 which are obtained from catechol.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote E: _Isomeric_, of similar composition but different structure\r\nand properties.]\r\n\r\n  Pyrocatechol 1-2.

Artificial products,\r\nhowever, with many of the reactions of tannins have been obtained from\r\nother members of the group, and most phenols and their derived acids\r\ngive either purplish or greenish black with ferric salts.\r\n\r\nSeveral classifications of the tannins have been suggested. The\r\ndivision most obvious to the tanner is into those tannins which yield\r\nthe whitish deposit in the surface of the leather, called \"bloom,\" and\r\nthose which do not. Stenhouse, some years since, divided tannins into\r\n2 classes, one of which gives a bluish, and the other a greenish-black\r\nwith ferric salts. In the main these 2 classes correspond to the 2\r\nformer, as most tannins which yield a blue-black with iron acetate\r\nalso give bloom to the leather. In some cases, however, the difference\r\nof tint is due to accidental impurities, and even gallotannic acid\r\nwill give a decided green with strongly acid ferric chloride. These\r\nclassifications both correspond to well-defined differences of\r\nconstitution, and it is obviously more scientific to arrange tannins\r\naccording to the products which they yield on decomposition, and which\r\nindicate their ultimate structure, rather than on any less essential\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIf those tannins which give bloom to leather are cautiously heated\r\nto about 392° F. (200° C.), they are decomposed, and a substance\r\nis volatilised which condenses in feathery crystals, and which on\r\nexamination turns out to be pyrogallol. Those tannins, on the other\r\nhand, which yield no bloom, but red deposits, produce a somewhat\r\nsimilar sublimate of catechol. From oak-bark and valonia, which yield\r\nboth bloom and red colouring matters, both catechol and pyrogallol\r\nhave been obtained. We may, therefore, divide tannins broadly into\r\nderivatives of catechol, which yield no bloom, and usually give\r\ngreenish-blacks with iron acetate, and which include hemlock, mimosa,\r\ncutch, gambier, quebracho, &c; derivatives of pyrogallol, which give\r\nbluish-blacks with iron, deposit bloom in leather, and embrace galls,\r\nsumach, divi-divi, myrobalans, pomegranate rind, &c., and tannins which\r\ncontain both pyrogallol and catechol, such as oak-bark and valonia, and\r\nwhich, as is well known, yield bloom, and give blue-blacks with iron.\r\n\r\nIf tannins are boiled with dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric acids, and\r\nallowed to ferment under the influence of pectose and other natural\r\nferments, which are always present in vegetable tanning materials, a\r\ndifferent series of decompositions takes place. Many tannins yield\r\nglucose, or starch sugar, as one of their products, or as that of\r\nclosely associated impurities. Of this more must be said later. In\r\naddition it will be found that the catechol tannins invariably yield\r\ninsoluble reddish-brown bodies which have been called phlobaphenes,\r\nand which differ from the original tannins in containing one or more\r\nmolecules less water, and which, in chemical language, are anhydrides\r\nof their respective tannic acids. The pyrogallol tannins, on the other\r\nhand, yield gallic acid, or ellagic acid (the deposit forming bloom)\r\neither alone or in mixture. Oak-bark and valonia give both bloom and\r\ninsoluble reds, and by digestion with acids in sealed tubes also gallic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nIf the red anhydrides, which are produced from the catechol tannins, be\r\nfused with caustic potash, or in many cases, if they be simply boiled\r\nwith concentrated potash solution, they are broken up still further,\r\nand from the fused mass, protocatechuic acid (which bears the same\r\nrelation to catechol that gallic acid does to pyrogallol) may always\r\nbe obtained. This is in many cases accompanied by phloroglucol, a\r\nphenol isomeric with pyrogallol, as may be seen by the table on p. 61,\r\nbut which tastes sweet like a sugar. Cutch, gambier, mimosa, quebracho,\r\nand probably many others, are phloroglucide tannins. The tannins which\r\ndo not yield phloroglucol frequently give acetic acid, and other acids\r\nof the \"fatty\" group, along with protocatechuic acid. We may summarise\r\nthis classification in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  Tannins boiled with dilute sulphuric acid\r\n     yield (frequently glucose, and)\r\n  /─────────────────────^───────────────────────\\\r\n  _Insoluble Reds_, which fused with potash\r\n      yield _protocatechuic acid_, and,----\r\n         /────────────────────────^───────────────────────────────────\\\r\n         _Phloroglucol_, as chestnut, gambier, kino, cutch, quebracho,\r\n             rhatany, fustic, horse-chestnut, tormentil.\r\n            _Acetic acid_, coffee, Peruvian bark, male-fern.\r\n\r\n  _Reds and gallic     }\r\n    and ellagic acids; } Oak-bark and valonia tannins.\r\n    no glucose_        }\r\n\r\n  _No reds, but gallic { Galls, myrobalans, sumach, divi-divi, pomegranate\r\n    and ellagic acids_ {   rind.\r\n                       { _These are probably mixtures of two tannins\r\n                            which yield_\r\n\r\n  _Gallic acid only_     Digallic, or pure gallotannic acid.\r\n\r\n  _Ellagic acid only_    Pure ellagitannic acid.\r\n\r\nThis classification is as yet very incomplete, and there are many\r\ntannins of which the decomposition products have not been examined,\r\nwhile our knowledge of the differences between the tannins which are\r\nclassed together is extremely limited. In order to make the information\r\nwhich has been given practically available for further research, the\r\ncharacteristics and mode of recognition of the different products\r\nwill be given, and as simple a scheme as possible of treatment of the\r\ntannin to be examined will be described; but the recognition of such\r\nproducts in a state of mixture presents great practical difficulties,\r\nand the tanner will usually be compelled to confine his attention to\r\nsimpler, though less conclusive tests, based on the work of chemical\r\nspecialists. Such tests will be described later (p. 111).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Pl. III.\r\n\r\n  _E & F N. Spon, London & New York_  \"MARS PHOTO\" SPRAGUE & CO. LONDON\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL FERMENTATION.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Methods of Examination of Tannins.\r\n\r\n_Decomposition by Heat._--The ordinary method is to distil the tannin\r\nor dried extract in a small retort, and examine the distillate for\r\ncatechol and pyrogallol. Unless the heat be very carefully regulated,\r\nmuch loss is caused by the destruction of the catechol and pyrogallol\r\nwith formation of metagallic acid, &c., and their detection is greatly\r\ncomplicated by the presence of secondary products. This difficulty is\r\nsomewhat lessened by passing a stream of carbon dioxide through the\r\nretort, which carries the products quickly out of the heated portion.\r\nA better method is to heat the tannin in glycerin (Thorpe, Chem. Soc.\r\nAbstr., 1881, 663; Allen, 'Commercial Organic Analysis,' 2nd ed.).\r\nAbout 1 _grm._ of the sample is heated with 5 _c.c._ of pure glycerin\r\nto 392°-410° F. (200°-210° C.) for 20 minutes. After cooling, about 20\r\n_c.c._ of water is added, and the liquid is shaken with an equal volume\r\nof ether, without previous filtration. The ethereous layer, which\r\ncontains the pyrogallol and catechol, is separated from the aqueous\r\nportion, evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in 50 _c.c._ of water.\r\nThe filtered solution is divided into several portions and tested with\r\nlime-water, ferric chloride, and ferric acetate (see pp. 66-7); by\r\nthese means it is easy to distinguish between catechol and pyrogallol;\r\nand either may be detected in presence of a small portion of the other;\r\nbut if in nearly equal quantities, their recognition is difficult.\r\nCatechol may be derived from catechin, &c., and pyrogallol from gallic\r\nacid, and it is therefore necessary in some cases to remove these\r\nbodies from the tannin before treatment. As a general rule, however,\r\ncatechins and catechol derivatives are only present in any quantity\r\nwith catechol-tannins, and the same is true of gallic acid with regard\r\nto pyrogallol. (For methods of separation see pp. 69, 71, 80). Catechol\r\nhas been formed by long continued heating of cellulose, starch, and\r\nother carbohydrates with water under pressure (see p. 67).\r\n\r\n_Products of the Decomposition of Tannins by Heat._--Pyrogallol,\r\n_pyrogallic acid_, C_{6}H_{6}O_{3}, has a bitter, but not sour taste,\r\nand feebly reddens litmus, but the addition of the smallest trace of\r\nalkali gives it an alkaline reaction. It is poisonous, 2 gr. having\r\nkilled a dog. It is soluble in less than 3 parts of cold water, and\r\nstill more freely in hot. It is also soluble in alcohol, ether,\r\nacetone, ethyl acetate, and glycerin, but not in absolute chloroform,\r\nor petroleum spirit. It fuses at 268° F. (131° C.) (_Etti_), and\r\nsublimes at about 410° F. (210° C.).\r\n\r\nWith pure ferrous sulphate it gives a white precipitate, which\r\nredissolves to a fine blue liquid in presence of the least trace of\r\nferric salt. Mineral acids change this to red, and the blue tint\r\nis restored by cautious neutralisation with ammonia, and is not\r\ndestroyed, but sometimes rendered greenish by excess of acetic, and\r\nother organic acids. Any excess of ammonia produces an amethyst-red,\r\nand acetic acid restores the blue. Its solution is turned brown by\r\ntraces of nitrous acid. With lime-water it produces a beautiful but\r\nevanescent purple, rapidly turning brown. In presence of alkalies it\r\nabsorbs oxygen from the air with great avidity, turning orange, brown,\r\nand black. Pyrogallol does not precipitate gelatin. Its solution\r\nrapidly reduces permanganate, Fehling's solution, and salts of gold,\r\nsilver,[F] mercury, and platinum. It precipitates copper and lead\r\nacetates, and with ammoniacal cupric sulphate it gives an intense\r\npurple-brown coloration. Gum arabic, saliva, and various other organic\r\nmatters cause solutions of pyrogallol exposed to the air to absorb\r\noxygen, by which purpurogallin is formed and separates in small yellow\r\ncapillary crystals. If 0·2 per cent. of pyrogallol be added to a 1\r\nper cent. solution of gum arabic, it becomes yellow in a few hours,\r\nand purpurogallin separates in hairlike crystals, which continue to\r\nincrease for some months. It these crystals are freed from pyrogallol\r\nby washing with water, and a trace of alkali is added, they dissolve\r\nwith an intense blue colour. Purpurogallol is also formed by oxidation\r\nwith silver nitrate, potash permanganate, and many other reagents.\r\nPyrogallol forms compounds with aldehydes; with formaldehyde, a body\r\nwhich reacts like a tannin and precipitates gelatin is produced.\r\nIf pyrogallol be heated with hydrochloric acid, and aldehyde,\r\nchloral, or acetone, a red substance is produced. The less volatile\r\nportions of crude beech-tar creasote contains ethers of pyrogallol,\r\nmethyl-pyrogallol, and propyl-pyrogallol, from which these bodies\r\nmay be obtained by the action of hydrochloric acid under pressure.\r\nMethyl- and propyl-pyrogallols differ from ordinary pyrogallol in\r\nhaving an atom of hydrogen replaced by the groups CH_{3} or C_{3}H_{7}\r\nrespectively; and it is very probable that some tannins are derivatives\r\nof such modified pyrogallols.\r\n\r\n[Footnote F: Hence its use as a \"developer\" in photography.]\r\n\r\nIf pyrogallol be heated rapidly to 482° F. (250° C.) it parts with\r\nthe elements of water, and is converted into metagallic acid,\r\nC_{6}H_{4}O_{2}, a black amorphous body, insoluble in water, soluble in\r\nalkalies. When pyrogallol is made in the ordinary way by heating gallic\r\nor tannic acids to 410° F. (210° C.), much of this body is formed, even\r\nif the process be conducted in a stream of carbonic acid, and the yield\r\nof pyrogallol usually amounts to only about 5 per cent. of the gallic\r\nacid employed (see p. 65).\r\n\r\nCatechol.--_Pyrocatechol_, _pyrocatechin_, _oxyphenic acid_,\r\nC_{6}H_{4}(OH)_{2}.\r\n\r\nSources.--Beside that of the decomposition of certain tannins by heat\r\n(see p. 63), catechol is produced by the dry distillation of catechin\r\nand some allied bodies which frequently accompany the tannins. It is\r\nalso formed together with pyrogallol and its homologues (see above) by\r\nthe dry distillation of wood, wood tar creasote consisting largely of\r\nethers of pyrocatechol and its homologues, methyl and pyrocatechol,\r\n&c., and hence it is also found in crude pyroligneous acid. It has also\r\nbeen produced by heating carbohydrates with water under pressure, and\r\nis found ready formed in Virginia-creeper (_Ampelopsis hæderacea_), and\r\nprobably in other plants. It has also been formed synthetically.\r\n\r\nReactions.--Catechol melts at 232° F. (111° C.) and sublimes at about\r\nthe same temperature, condensing in brilliant laminæ like benzoic acid.\r\nIt is readily soluble in water, alcohol, and ether, and is extracted\r\nfrom its aqueous solution when shaken with the latter. Its aqueous\r\nsolution precipitates lead acetate but not gelatin or alkaloids. With\r\nlime-water or caustic soda solution it becomes reddish, but remains\r\nclear for some time. It does not colour ferrous salts, but gives a\r\ndark green with ferric (avoiding excess); and after some time a black\r\nprecipitate. The green is changed to a fine violet-red by alkalies and\r\nhydric sodic carbonate, and restored by acids. To fir-wood moistened\r\nwith hydrochloric acid it gives, like phloroglucol, a violet coloration\r\nby combination with the trace of vanillin which this wood contains.\r\nThis reaction does not seem to be given by pyrogallol or by common\r\nphenol. Catechol gives a red coloration with citric acid, and after\r\nstanding, ceases to react with iron.\r\n\r\n_Decomposition of Tannins by Dilute Acids._--It has been stated that\r\ntannins when heated with dilute sulphuric or hydrochloric acids are\r\ndecomposed, yielding frequently glucose, and either gallic or ellagic\r\nacids, or red anhydrides. To determine whether glucose is produced, the\r\ntannin must first be carefully purified from glucose, gums, or other\r\nbodies likely to interfere, by the methods mentioned on p. 58. Either\r\nthe tannin itself or its washed lead-salt may be used, and must be\r\nheated to 212° F. (100° C.) for some hours in a sealed tube, or tightly\r\nclosed bottle with dilute hydrochloric acid. After cooling, the mixture\r\nmust be allowed to stand for some time to separate any sparingly\r\nsoluble products, which must be filtered off. The filtrate must be\r\nshaken with ether and acetic ether to remove gallic acid (p. 59), the\r\naqueous solution must be boiled, neutralised with soda, precipitated\r\nwith basic lead acetate to remove any traces of tannin or colouring\r\nmatters, the liquid again filtered, and excess of lead removed with\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, the mixture again neutralised with soda, and\r\nheated to boiling with Fehling's copper-solution, when a yellow or red\r\nprecipitate of cuprous oxide will prove the formation of glucose. The\r\nprecipitate produced by cooling may consist (of lead chloride, if the\r\nlead salt has been used,) of ellagic acid, or of red anhydrides or\r\nphlobaphenes of the tannin. The lead chloride may be removed by washing\r\nwith boiling water. If the remaining precipitate has a pale yellow or\r\nfawn colour it probably consists of ellagic acid (see p. 71), soluble\r\nin ammonia and hot alcohol and dissolving freely in strong nitric acid,\r\nforming an intense crimson liquid.\r\n\r\nThe ethereous layer will contain the gallic acid, if any has been\r\nformed, and must be evaporated to dryness, and the residue taken up\r\nwith cold water, and filtered. Addition of a few drops of solution of\r\npotassium cyanide will produce a fine red coloration if gallic acid be\r\npresent, which rapidly fades, but is restored by shaking. A solution\r\nof picric acid, to which excess of ammonia has been added, gives a\r\nred coloration rapidly changing to a fine green, even in very dilute\r\nsolutions of gallic acid.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, generally necessary to resort to so elaborate a\r\nprocess merely to distinguish the class to which tannins belong. The\r\ntannin, or its infusion, may be simply boiled with dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid for some time, replacing the acid lost by evaporation. The\r\nsolution is diluted to 50 _c.c._ and allowed to cool. Ellagic acid and\r\nphlobaphenes may separate, and must be filtered off. If the precipitate\r\nis pale, it is probably ellagic acid, and maybe recognised by the\r\nnitric acid test. If red, it probably consists of phlobaphenes, and may\r\nbe treated with cold alcohol, in which phlobaphenes are freely soluble,\r\nbut ellagic acid very little. The ellagic acid will therefore be left\r\non the filter if present in any quantity, while the alcoholic solution\r\nmay be precipitated by the addition of water, and the phlobaphenes\r\nfurther examined by treatment with potash.\r\n\r\nGallic Acid.--_Dioxysalicylic acid_, C_{6}H_{2}(OH)_{3}CO.OH, exists\r\nready formed in some plants, and is a product of the fermentation\r\nof gallotannic acid under the influence of the nitrogenous ferment,\r\npectase, or of its decomposition by boiling with acids or alkalies.\r\nIt crystallises in white, or yellowish white needles, containing 1\r\nmol. (9·5 per cent.) of water, which it loses at 212° F. (100° C.).\r\nIt is soluble in 100 parts of cold or 3 of boiling water, in alcohol\r\nor glycerin, and slightly so in ether, by agitation with which it may\r\nhowever be removed from its aqueous solution. Gallic acid fuses at a\r\ntemperature of about 449° F. (232° C.) (Etti, Chem. Soc. Jour., xxxvi.\r\n160), but at about 410° F. (210° C.) begins to lose carbonic dioxide,\r\nand yields a crystalline sublimate of pyrogallol (see p. 66). If the\r\nheat be raised suddenly to 482° F. (250° C.) a considerable quantity of\r\nblack shining metagallic acid is formed.\r\n\r\nAqueous solution of gallic acid gives the following\r\nreactions:--Solution of ferric chloride gives a deep blue coloration\r\nwhich is destroyed by boiling. Ferrous sulphate, if free from ferric\r\nsalt, gives no reaction in dilute solutions, but a white precipitate\r\nin strong ones. The mixture rapidly darkens by oxidation. In alkaline\r\nsolution gallic acid absorbs oxygen from the air and darkens from the\r\nformation of tannomelanic acid. Lime-water produces a white precipitate\r\nwhich rapidly becomes blue from oxidation. The same reaction is\r\nproduced by baryta-water, or by the chlorides of barium or calcium on\r\naddition of ammonia (distinction from pyrogallol). It is distinguished\r\nfrom gallotannic acid by the following:--It does not precipitate\r\ngelatin, except in the presence of gum. It does not precipitate tartar\r\nemetic in presence of ammonic chloride, though both tannin and gallic\r\nacid are precipitated by tartar emetic alone. It precipitates lead\r\nacetate but not lead nitrate, while tannin precipitates both. A dilute\r\nsolution of potassium cyanide gives a red coloration which disappears\r\non standing, but is restored by shaking with air. If to even a very\r\ndilute solution of gallic acid, sodic arsenate, or some other faintly\r\nalkaline salts be added, the mixture absorbs oxygen and becomes a deep\r\ngreen. Aqueous solution of picric acid to which excess of ammonia\r\nhas previously been added gives a red coloration, changing to green.\r\nTannic and pyrogallic acid produce no reaction with cyanide, and\r\nwith ammonic picrate a reddish coloration only. Gallic acid reduces\r\nsilver nitrate and gold chloride rapidly when hot, but not Fehling's\r\nsolution, and decolorises acidified potassic permanganate. If tannin\r\nand other oxidisable bodies be removed from its solution it may be\r\nestimated quantitatively by titration with permanganate in presence\r\nof indigo (see p. 118). It may be separated from tannin by gelatin\r\nor hide raspings (see pp. 121, 124). Gallotannic and quercitannic\r\nacids may also be removed by precipitation with ammoniacal solution\r\nof cupric sulphate, or by cupric acetate, in presence of excess of\r\nammonic carbonate (see also p. 125). Many other tannins, however,\r\ngive precipitates with cupric salts which are soluble in ammonia and\r\nammonic carbonate. In absence of such tannins it may be estimated\r\ngravimetrically by precipitation with cupric acetate. The precipitate\r\nis rapidly washed with water and digested with a solution of ammonic\r\ncarbonate, in which it dissolves; any insoluble cupric tannate is\r\nfiltered off, the solution is evaporated to dryness and the residue\r\nmoistened with nitric acid and ignited. The weight of the remaining\r\ncupric oxide multiplied by 0·9 gives the weight of the gallic acid plus\r\na little tannin dissolved by the ammonic solution.\r\n\r\nGallic acid may also be separated from tannin by lead acetate strongly\r\nacidified with acetic acid, by which tannic acid is precipitated, while\r\nlead gallate is dissolved.\r\n\r\nEllagic acid C_{14}H_{8}O_{9}, when pure, is a sulphur-yellow\r\ncrystalline body almost insoluble even in boiling water, and only\r\nslightly so in alcohol and ether, though by agitation with the latter,\r\nsmall quantities may be completely removed from aqueous solution. In\r\nhot alcohol it dissolves with a yellow colour, and crystallises on\r\ncooling. Solid ellagic acid gives with ferric chloride at first a\r\ngreenish, and then a black coloration. In strong nitric acid it is\r\nsoluble with a deep crimson coloration: that from divi-divi gives a\r\ncrimson liquid on dilution with water, but from other sources it is\r\nrather orange.\r\n\r\nEllagic acid may be obtained in considerable quantity by pouring\r\na concentrated alcoholic extract of divi-divi into water, when it\r\nseparates and may be filtered off and recrystallised from hot alcohol.\r\nIt may also be obtained by boiling the aqueous extracts of divi,\r\nmyrabolans, pomegranate rind, &c., with dilute hydrochloric acid, and\r\npurified by the same means. It may be prepared from gallic acid by\r\nheating the latter with dry arsenic acid to 320° F. (160° C.), but is\r\ndifficult to purify from traces of arsenic. Ellagic acid has not been\r\nreconverted into gallic acid. Its constitutional formula is, according\r\nto Schiff,\r\n\r\n            {CO.OH\r\n            {OH\r\n  C_{6}H_{2}{\r\n            {O────┐\r\n            {O }  │\r\n               }  │\r\n            {CO}  │\r\n            {O────┘\r\n  C_{6}H_{2}{\r\n            {OH\r\n            {OH\r\n\r\ndiffering from gallotannic acid only by the loss of two atoms of\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\nAir-dried ellagic acid, C_{14}H_{8}O_{9} + OH_{2}, contains 1 mol.\r\nof water, which it loses at 212° F. (100° C.) but reabsorbs in moist\r\nair. When heated to 392°-410° F. (200°-210° C.) it forms an anhydride,\r\nC_{14}H_{6}O_{8}, losing another molecule of water, which it does not\r\nrecover from moist air, but is slowly reconverted to ellagic acid by\r\nboiling with water.\r\n\r\nThe phlobaphenes or reds are chemically the anhydrides of the different\r\ntannic acids from which they are derived, or in other words they\r\nare formed from the tannins by the loss of one or more molecules of\r\nwater. It is in this way that they are produced by the action of\r\nacids, and similarly they are often formed when alcoholic or highly\r\nconcentrated aqueous extracts are poured into cold water, under which\r\ncircumstances a part of the tannin seems unable to take up water\r\nagain, and separates as a red precipitate. They exist ready formed in\r\nmost tanning materials capable of producing them. They are soluble in\r\nalcohol, by which they may be extracted from tanning materials or dried\r\nresidues containing them. They are also dissolved by dilute alkalies\r\nand alkaline carbonates, and by borax, which is said to be used in the\r\npreparation of some extracts, and was suggested by Sadlon as a means of\r\nmaking phlobaphenes available for tanning. Many of them are scarcely\r\nsoluble in water even at a boiling temperature, though they become\r\nmore so in presence of sugar, tannic acid, and some other substances.\r\nTheir solubility in water depends on their degree of hydration, many\r\ntannins giving a series of anhydrides of which those containing only\r\none molecule of water less than the original tannin are quite soluble\r\nin water, while the higher members of the series become less and less\r\nsoluble as they lose water. Those which are soluble form the colouring\r\nmatters of tanning materials, and generally are practically tannins,\r\nprecipitating gelatin and combining with hide to form leather. Hemlock\r\nbark yields a series of such bodies, of which the lower members are\r\ndeep red soluble tannins, while the higher form the red sediment, so\r\nwell known to extract-tanners. Thus it is chemically impossible to\r\ndecolorise hemlock extract without at the same time greatly lessening\r\nits tanning power, though by careful manufacturing and concentration\r\nat low temperature, the proportion of the higher anhydrides formed may\r\nbe kept at a minimum. In many cases it is known, as in gambier, and\r\nin others it is probable that the tannin itself is merely the first\r\nanhydride of the series, and derived from a catechin which itself is a\r\nwhite crystalline body destitute of tanning properties (see p. 79).\r\n\r\n_Decomposition of the Phlobaphenes by Fusion with Caustic\r\nAlkalies._--It has been mentioned (p. 64) that the reds of different\r\ntannins yielded, in addition to protocatechuic acid, either\r\nphloroglucol, or acetic acid, or some other member of the fatty acid\r\nseries. Some tannins, as those of alder and hop, give both phloroglucol\r\nand acetic acid, but it is very possible that this arises from the\r\npresence of two distinct tannins in these materials. It is stated that\r\nall those tannins which yield acetic acid on fusion with potash, also\r\nyield considerable quantities of glucose to dilute acids, while the\r\nphloroglucide tannins do not do so. Gallic acid fused with caustic\r\nsoda has been found by Barth and Schroeder to produce a small quantity\r\nof phloroglucol, and it is similarly formed by resorcinol and common\r\nphenol (Chem. Soc. Jour., xliv. 60). It is therefore possible that in\r\nsome cases where phloroglucol is detected, it may have been formed by\r\nthe action of the alkali, and not have been originally a constituent of\r\nthe tannin.\r\n\r\nThe following is the best method in which to proceed to investigate\r\nthe products of the action of potash. 20 _grm._ of the red, or of the\r\ntannin from which it is derived, or its lead salt, is boiled with 150\r\n_c.c._ of solution of caustic potash of 1·20 sp. gr. for 3 hours, and\r\nthe liquid is then concentrated with constant stirring till it becomes\r\npasty. It is then cooled and treated with a volume of dilute sulphuric\r\nacid slightly more than enough to neutralise the alkali employed. After\r\ncooling it is filtered from potassium sulphate and other solid matters,\r\nand the filtrate treated with sodium bicarbonate till its wine-red\r\nreaction with litmus shows that the sulphuric acid is neutralised. The\r\nliquid is then shaken with an equal measure of ether, the ethereous\r\nlayer drawn off and the treatment repeated several times. On distilling\r\noff the ether, phloroglucol is left and may be purified by solution in\r\nwater, when protocatechuic acid and other products may be precipitated\r\nby neutral lead acetate, and filtered off, and the phloroglucol again\r\nextracted with ether, and recognised by its reaction with ferric\r\nchloride and bromine water, and by its sweet taste.\r\n\r\nPhloroglucol.--_Phloroglucin_ C_{6}H_{6}O_{3} is a phenol isomeric\r\nwith pyrogallol. It crystallises with 2 molecules of water, which\r\nit loses at 212° F. (100° C.). It melts at about 428° F. (220° C.),\r\nsublimes without odour, and solidifies again on cooling. It is soluble\r\nin water, alcohol, and ether, and by agitation with the latter it\r\nmay be removed from its aqueous solution. It is not precipitated by\r\nany metallic salt but basic lead acetate. It is coloured deep violet\r\nred by ferric chloride. If bromine be added to its concentrated\r\nsolution in water, it absorbs 3 atoms, forming tribromophloroglucol,\r\nC_{6}H_{6}Br_{3}O_{3}, which separates in crystalline needles, with\r\nevolution of heat and a very irritating odour. If a deal shaving\r\nbe moistened with solution of phloroglucol, and then with strong\r\nhydrochloric acid, it soon takes a deep violet colour, from the\r\nformation of phloroglucol-vanillin with the trace of vanillin contained\r\nin all coniferous woods. Pyrocatechol gives a similar reaction, and it\r\nis stated by Etti (Chem. Soc. Jour., xliv. 60) that pyrogallol forms\r\na similar compound; it does not, however, give the colour reaction on\r\ndeal. It is extremely probable that this reaction may be used to detect\r\nphloroglucide tannins without the troublesome fusion with potash, in\r\ncases where pyrocatechol is absent. The reaction is strongly given\r\nby gambier, which is known to contain phloroglucol, but not by oak\r\nbark and valonia, though these contain protocatechuic acid. If to a\r\ndilute solution of phloroglucol a solution of aniline or toluidine\r\nnitrate be added, and then a trace of potassic nitrite, the liquid\r\ngradually becomes yellow or orange, then turbid, and finally deposits\r\na cinnabar-red precipitate. This reaction is given by gambier, but is\r\nalso produced by oak bark infusion, which is not supposed to contain\r\nphloroglucol; and gall tannin, pyrogallol, and other substances give\r\nsimilar but browner precipitates.\r\n\r\nProtocatechuic Acid.--C_{6}H_{3}(OH)_{2}CO.OH, one of the six isomeric\r\ndihydroxybenzoic acids of this formula (see Miller, Chem. Soc. Jour.,\r\nxli. 198), crystallises in needles and plates with 1 mol. water, which\r\nit loses at 212° F. (100° C.). It melts at 228° F. (109° C.) and on\r\nfurther heating is decomposed into pyrocatechol and carbonic acid.\r\nIt is somewhat soluble in cold water, and readily so in hot water,\r\nalcohol, and ether. It is coloured bluish green by ferric chloride,\r\nwhich is changed to red by alkalies. Solutions of protocatechuates\r\ngive a violet coloration with ferric salts. It is precipitated by lead\r\nacetate, and reduces silver ammonio-nitrate, but not Fehling's solution\r\n(see also p. 107).\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitution of Tannins.\r\n\r\nHaving described the products of decomposition, something must be\r\nsaid of the way in which these constituents are combined to form the\r\nunaltered tannins. The only tannin of which we have as yet anything\r\napproaching complete knowledge is that obtained from galls, sumach, and\r\nmyrabolans, and which is thence called gallotannic acid.\r\n\r\n_Gallotannic, or digallic acid_ exists as the principal tannic acid\r\nof the galls of oak, tamarisk, &c.; and, in mixture with more or less\r\nellagitannic acid, in myrabolans, divi-divi, sumach, pomegranate rind,\r\nand many other plant-products. It has also been formed by Schiff from\r\ngallic acid, by mixing it, after drying at 230° F. (110° C.), with\r\nphosphorus oxychloride to a thin paste, and heating, first to 212° F.\r\n(100° C.) and then to 248° F. (120° C ). Much hydrochloric acid was\r\nevolved, and the gallic acid was converted into a yellow powder, which\r\nafter purification by washing with ether, dissolving in water, allowing\r\nthe gallic acid to crystallise out, saturating with salt, washing the\r\nprecipitated tannin in salt solution, and redissolving in alcohol and\r\nether, had all the reactions of purified gall tannin, but was perfectly\r\nreconverted into gallic acid on boiling with hydrochloric acid, without\r\nthe formation of any trace of ellagic acid, or glucose. By analysis of\r\nthe tannin and its acetyl compounds it was shown to be digallic acid,\r\nand its constitutional formula is almost certainly as follows:--\r\n\r\n            {CO.OH\r\n            {OH\r\n  C_{6}H_{2}{\r\n            {OH\r\n            {O }\r\n               }\r\n            {CO}\r\n            {OH\r\n  C_{6}H_{2}{OH\r\n            {OH\r\n\r\nBy boiling gallic acid with solution of arsenic acid, Schiff obtained a\r\nproduct which precipitated gelatin, and otherwise reacted like tannin,\r\nand he regards this as digallic acid, but other experimenters have\r\nfailed to obtain digallic acid by this means, and have found that on\r\ncomplete removal of arsenic, the compound was reconverted to gallic\r\nacid. It therefore remains a moot point whether digallic acid is really\r\nformed, and reconverted into gallic acid by the prolonged action of\r\nhydric sulphide, which is necessary to remove the arsenic, or whether,\r\nas seems more probable, the supposed tannin is merely an arsenical\r\ncompound of gallic acid.\r\n\r\nGallotannic acid as obtained from plants invariably yields traces of\r\nglucose, as well as of ellagic acid, when boiled with dilute acids. It\r\nis still an open question whether the glucose exists in the plant as a\r\nglucoside of tannic acid or is always the product of some impurity (as\r\nis shown by Etti to be the case with oak bark, where lævulin is always\r\npresent). It seems most probable however that natural gallotannic acid\r\nis really a glucoside of digallic acid, or possibly, according to the\r\ntheory of Hlasiwetz, a gummide, or compound of dextrin, which, by the\r\naction of acids, is easily converted into glucose. What has been said\r\nof gallotannic acid in this respect, applies to many other tannins,\r\nwhich like it give glucose by treatment with acids.\r\n\r\nGallotannic acid is met with, in commerce, in the form of light\r\nbuff-coloured scales, with a faint peculiar odour and a powerfully\r\nastringent taste. It is soluble in 6 parts of cold water or glycerin,\r\nand very readily in hot. It is also very soluble in alcohol containing\r\nwater, but much less so in absolute. It is moderately soluble in\r\nwashed, but scarcely at all in anhydrous ether, chloroform, benzene, or\r\npetroleum spirit.\r\n\r\nThe commercial acid usually contains more or less of gallic acid, which\r\nmay be detected by dissolving in water, shaking with ether, and after\r\ndecanting and evaporating the ether, applying the tests described under\r\ngallic acid (p. 70). It may also be frequently distinguished in the\r\nsimple aqueous solution of the tannic acid by the tests given. Its\r\nquantity may be determined (in the absence of other impurities) by the\r\nLöwenthal method (p. 121), the gallic acid forming the \"not-tannin,\"\r\nby comparison with a solution of pure gallic acid.\r\n\r\nCommercial tannic acid is sometimes adulterated with starch, which is\r\nleft undissolved on treating the sample with ordinary alcohol.\r\n\r\nFor the estimation of gallotannic acid see pp. 118 _et seq._ For its\r\nprincipal reactions, Table, p. 113.\r\n\r\n_Ellagitannic acid_, C_{14}H_{10}O_{10}, is contained in divi-divi,\r\nmyrabolans, and as a glucoside in pomegranate rind. When boiled\r\nwith dilute acids, or treated with water at 230° F. (110° C.) in\r\na sealed tube, it yields its anhydride, ellagic acid (see p. 71),\r\nC_{14}H_{8}O_{9}. In its reactions ellagitannic acid closely resembles\r\ngallotannic acid.\r\n\r\n_Quercitannic acid._ Oak-bark tannin.--This tannin may be prepared\r\nfrom oak bark by agitating an alcoholic extract with ethyl acetate,\r\nand separating and evaporating the ethereous layer. It is still\r\ncontaminated with a brownish-green terpene resin, and with some of the\r\nhigher anhydrides of the tannin. The resin may be removed by treating\r\nthe dried extract with ether or benzene, in which it is readily\r\nsoluble; and the phlobaphenes, or higher anhydrides, by dissolving\r\nthe tannin in ether-alcohol, or probably to a great extent, by simple\r\nsolution in cold water in which the phlobaphenes are scarcely soluble.\r\n\r\nIt may also be prepared by evaporating the alcoholic extract, and\r\nextracting with water, which leaves the phlobaphenes, or higher\r\nanhydrides undissolved. The first anhydride, which is partially\r\nsoluble, may be precipitated by the addition of salt, and the\r\nquercitannic acid extracted by shaking the filtered solution with\r\nacetic ether. In very dilute alcohol it yields a pure yellow\r\nprecipitate with lead acetate. In aqueous solution the precipitate\r\nis light-brown. It gives a blue-black with ferric salts. When pure,\r\nquercitannic acid yields nothing to pure ether or to benzene.\r\n\r\nIf quercitannic acid be heated to 266°-284° F. (130°-140° C.) it loses\r\nwater, and yields a red anhydride slightly soluble in water, which\r\nconstitutes the red colouring matter of oak bark, and which has also\r\nbeen called \"difficultly soluble tannin.\" It precipitates gelatin and\r\nis one of the class which Eitner well designates \"tanning colouring\r\nmatters.\" It gives a brownish red with lead acetate, and a blue-black\r\nwith ferric salts; it is difficultly soluble in water and ether, but\r\nreadily so in alcohol of all strengths. Together with other anhydrides,\r\nit exists naturally formed in the bark. At higher temperatures, or by\r\nboiling with acids, a series of higher anhydrides may be obtained which\r\nare quite insoluble in water, but are soluble in alcohol and caustic\r\nalkalies. No glucose is produced by treatment of pure quercitannic\r\nacid with acids, that formed by so treating oak-bark extract being due\r\nto the alteration of the lævulose present. If oak-reds are fused with\r\npotash they yield, according to Johansen (Chem. Soc. Jour., xxxii.\r\n721), protocatechuic and butyric acids. If heated in sealed tubes with\r\ndilute hydrochloric acid, gallic acid only is formed, with evolution\r\nof methyl chloride. The constitutional formula of quercitannic acid is\r\nas yet very uncertain: it is probably a methyl derivative of digallic\r\nacid. Its formula is variously given as C_{17}H_{16}O_{9} (Etti, Chem.\r\nSoc. Jour., xliv. 994), C_{28}H_{26}O_{15} (Ibid. xl. 901, Löwe),\r\nC_{19}H_{16}O_{10} (Böttinger, Berichte, xvi. 2710). For further\r\ndetails the original memoirs must be consulted.\r\n\r\nFor the reactions of oak-bark and valonia infusions the Table, p. 113,\r\nmay be consulted.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the catechol-tannins it will be necessary to speak\r\nof a group of compounds of which it is probable that these tannins are\r\ndecomposition products. These are the catechins. It is as yet by no\r\nmeans certain how far they should be considered a group, some chemists\r\nholding the opinion that there is only one catechin, of which the rest\r\nare merely impure preparations.\r\n\r\nCatechin is a white crystalline substance, contained to the extent\r\nof some 30 per cent. in cube gambier, and in smaller proportion in\r\nblock gambier and cutch, and very probably in all tanning materials\r\nyielding catechol-tannins. It melts at 422-1/2° F. (217° C.) and\r\nyields a sublimate of catechol on further heating. It is readily\r\nsoluble in alcohol and in boiling water, but requires 1133 parts of\r\ncold water for its solution. Hence it separates on cooling from a hot\r\nsolution of gambier, and may be purified by redissolving in hot water\r\nand treatment with animal charcoal, and subsequent crystallisation.\r\nIt may also be extracted from its aqueous solution by agitation with\r\nether. It possesses no acid properties, though some writers have\r\nincorrectly called it catechuic acid. The aqueous solution gives\r\nprecipitates with lead acetate and mercuric chloride, and reduces\r\nammonia-nitrate of silver; but, unlike tannins, it does not precipitate\r\ngelatin, alkaloids, or tartar emetic. It is oxidised by permanganate\r\nin presence of free acid, and hence, when in solution, is estimated\r\nby the Löwenthal method as \"not tannin.\" It dissolves in concentrated\r\nsulphuric acid with a deep purple coloration. By fusion with caustic\r\nalkalies it yields protocatechuic acid and phloroglucol together with\r\nhydrogen. Its constitution is very uncertain, but it is probable\r\nthat the phloroglucol stands in a somewhat similar relation to the\r\nprotocatechuic acid that glycerin does to the fatty acids in natural\r\nfats; and that its decomposition by fused alkalies is a process much\r\nakin to saponification. This constitution is represented by the\r\nfollowing formula:--\r\n\r\n                                      {O.C_{6}H_{3}(OH)_{2}\r\n  C_{19}H_{18}O_{8} or C_{7}H_{8}O_{2}{\r\n                                      {O.C_{6}H_{3}(OH)_{2}\r\n\r\nWhen acted on by heat and dilute acids the following anhydrides are\r\nproduced--the formulæ given must be taken as to some extent provisional.\r\n\r\n  Catechin 2C_{19}H_{18}O_{8} = C_{38}H_{36}O_{16}  Not acid; does not\r\n                                                      precipitate gelatin.\r\n\r\n  Catechutannic acid            C_{38}H_{34}O_{15}}\r\n                                                  } Acid, precipitate\r\n  Dianydride                    C_{38}H_{32}O_{14}}   gelatin.\r\n\r\n  Trianydride                   C_{38}H_{30}O_{13}} Insoluble in water.\r\n\r\n  Catechuretin                  C_{38}H_{30}O_{12}} Soluble in alcohol and\r\n                                                      alkalies.\r\n\r\nThe white deposit which occurs on pit sides and in the interior of\r\nleather where gambier is largely used, and which is sometimes called\r\n\"the whites,\" consists of catechin. It may be decomposed by warm\r\nsulphuric acid. This deposit is favoured by the use of _hot_ gambier\r\nliquors. It is probable that by exposure to the air and by boiling,\r\ncatechin is gradually converted into catechutannic acid during the\r\ntanning process, and hence the practical tanning value of cube gambier\r\nis probably greater than analysis indicates. Hunt has, however, shown\r\n(Jour. Soc. Chem. Ind., iv. 266) that, as estimated by the Löwenthal\r\nprocess, the tannin is to some extent lessened by boiling.\r\n\r\n_Kinoin_, C_{14}H_{12}O_{6} (Etti, Berl. Ber., xi. 1879), obtained from\r\ngreen or malabar kino, a product very similar to cutch, by boiling\r\nwith dilute hydrochloric acid and extraction by agitation with ether,\r\nis very similar in its properties to catechin. It does not itself\r\nprecipitate gelatin, but like catechin, yields a series of anhydrides\r\nor reds, which do so. On dry distillation it yields catechol and\r\ncommon phenol; and when heated with hydrochloric acid at 248°-266° F.\r\n(120°-130° C.) methyl chloride, catechol and gallic acid. Hence its\r\nconstitution is probably that of methyl-catechol gallate.\r\n\r\n_Quebracho-catechin_ was found by P. N. Arata (Chem. Soc. Jour., xl.\r\n1152) in the wood of quebracho colorado (p. 40), but in too small\r\nquantity for detailed investigation. It probably bears a similar\r\nrelation to quebrachitannic acid that ordinary catechin does to\r\ncatechutannic acid. It is insoluble in cold and only slightly soluble\r\nin hot water, but very soluble in alcohol and ether. Its solution is\r\nclouded by normal lead acetate, and gives rose-coloured precipitates\r\nwith basic lead acetate and mercurous nitrate, and blackish with ferric\r\nacetate; it reduces silver-nitrate and gold chloride, and is coloured\r\nyellow by nitric acid, red by sulphuric acid, yellowish by sodium\r\nhypochlorite, and green by Fehling's solution. It does not precipitate\r\ngelatin, or alkaloids.\r\n\r\n_Catechutannic_ acid has been pretty fully described under catechin,\r\nof which it is the first anhydride (p. 80). It is possibly identical\r\nwith mimo-tannic acid, the tannin of cutch and mimosa bark, which is\r\nchemically very similar, but greatly differs in its practical effect\r\nin tanning. For some further reactions of cutch and gambier infusions\r\nsee p. 113. It gives a greyish-green precipitate with ferric salts, and\r\n(distinction from gallotannic acid) precipitates cupric sulphate but\r\nnot tartar emetic.\r\n\r\n_Quebrachitannic_ acid is got from the wood of the quebracho colorado,\r\n_Quebrachia lorentzii_ (formerly _Loxopterygium_) which must not be\r\nconfounded with the bark of the _Aspidospermum quebrachia_, which is\r\nvaluable, not for its tannin, but for an alkaloid, aspidospermin,\r\nwhich is used for medical purposes. It has been pretty thoroughly\r\ninvestigated by P. N. Arata (Chem. Soc. Jour., xxxiv. 986 and xl.\r\n1152). It seems, however, a little doubtful to the writer whether the\r\nsubstance investigated by Arata was not the anhydride of the tannin,\r\nrather than the tannin itself, as it presents many points of analogy to\r\ncatechu-red and was less soluble in water than quebracho tannin appears\r\nin practice to be.\r\n\r\nAccording to Arata, quebrachitannic acid is a pale red amorphous mass,\r\nhaving an astringent taste and yielding a light cinnamon coloured\r\npowder. It is insoluble in carbon-bisulphide, turpentine oil, and\r\nbenzene. Its aqueous solution gives a white precipitate with both\r\nnormal and basic lead acetate, which when heated, acquires first a\r\nrose, and then a chocolate colour; with ferric chloride a green liquid\r\nis produced, which changes after a time to red and becomes black on\r\naddition of sodium acetate. It forms white precipitates with gelatin,\r\nalbumen, and alkaloids. By dry distillation it yields catechol. By\r\nfusion with potash or the action of sulphuric acid, phloroglucol and\r\nprotocatechuic acid, while nitric acid converts it into oxalic and\r\npicric acids. While it shows great similarity in its reactions to\r\ncatechutannic acid, it differs materially in percentage composition,\r\ncontaining only 52·5 as compared with 62·0 per cent. of carbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWATER AS USED IN TANNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWater, as obtained from rivers, wells, or water companies, contains a\r\nvariety of impurities which affect its use in tanning, but of which\r\nin most cases the precise influence is very imperfectly known. These\r\nmay be classified into (1) merely suspended matters, such as clay and\r\nmud, and sometimes animal or vegetable organisms such as infusoria;\r\n(2) dissolved mineral matters, which consist mostly of lime and\r\nmagnesia salts and which make the water hard; (3) and organic dissolved\r\nimpurities, such as the brown colour of peat water and the putrefying\r\nanimal matters of sewage contamination.\r\n\r\n_Mud_ is always objectionable. It frequently contains organic slime\r\nand organisms which encourage the putrefaction of hides put in it to\r\nwash or soften. It also almost invariably contains iron as one of its\r\nconstituents, and hence stains leather, and gives bad coloured liquors.\r\nIt is not easily got rid of by filtration, as large filter-beds are\r\nexpensive and difficult to keep in order, and much space is required\r\nto clear water by subsidence. Some filter easily cleaned offers the\r\nbest chance of success. The Pulsometer Company supply such a filter,\r\nconsisting of sponge tightly packed below a perforated piston. To\r\ncleanse the filter a stream of water is passed the reverse way, and the\r\npiston raised, and worked up and down, either by hand or power, so as\r\nto loosen and knead the sponge. The Atkins \"water scrubber,\" in which\r\nsand may be used as a filtering medium, seems also well adapted for\r\nthe purpose. If lime be precipitated by Clark's, or other process, it\r\nusually carries down the mud with it.\r\n\r\nRain water and the water of streams in mountain districts of hard\r\nigneous rock are generally nearly free from mineral constituents. This\r\nis the case with the Glasgow water from Loch Katrine, and the Thirlmere\r\nwater which is to supply Manchester. Such water, if cold enough, and\r\nfree from mud and organic impurity, is the best for almost every\r\npurpose in tanning. Most river water, however, and all spring water, is\r\ncontaminated with mineral matter which it has dissolved out of the soil\r\nand rocks through which it has flowed. The principal of these mineral\r\nconstituents are lime and magnesia. These occur both as sulphates and\r\nchlorides, and as hydric carbonates, or \"bicarbonates.\" The sulphates\r\nand chlorides constitute \"permanent\" hardness, while that due to\r\nbicarbonates is called \"temporary,\" from the fact that on boiling, half\r\nthe carbonic acid is driven off, and the lime or magnesia is deposited\r\nas an insoluble neutral carbonate, thus softening the water. Any water\r\nwhich can be softened in this way by boiling may also be softened by\r\nthe addition of a suitable quantity of lime, thus:--\r\n\r\n      Calcic hydric\r\n       carbonate.          Lime.       Chalk.     Water.\r\n\r\n  (CO_{3})_{2}CaH_{2} + Ca.(OH)_{2} = 2CaCO_{3} + 2OH_{2}\r\n\r\nThis is Clark's process, and the chalk may either be separated\r\nby subsidence, which quickly takes place, or by a special filter\r\n(Porter-Clark). Thus the Bristol water, which from determinations by\r\nMr. W. N. Evans, contains considerable temporary hardness and but\r\nlittle of permanent, may be almost completely softened by Clark's\r\nmethod. (For method of determining hardness and quantity of lime\r\nrequired, see p. 97).\r\n\r\nThe lime and magnesia constituting permanent hardness may be removed\r\nby the addition of sodic carbonate (soda ash or crystals); but this\r\nis expensive on a large scale, and as an equivalent quantity of sodic\r\nsulphate or chloride is left in the water, it is for most purposes\r\nof questionable advantage, though in some cases useful for the feed\r\nwater of boilers. When employed for this purpose, the water should if\r\npossible be softened and settled before using, instead of adding the\r\nsoda in the boiler itself, as is generally done. Soda is the active\r\ningredient of many boiler compositions. For preventing furring, most\r\ntanning materials or even waste tan-liquors are very effective, and the\r\ndanger of any corrosive action is lessened by the addition of a portion\r\nof soda ash. So far as is yet known, from the tanning point of view, it\r\nis hardly necessary to make any distinction between lime and magnesia,\r\nwhich may be considered simply as \"hardness.\" A hard water probably\r\nsoftens dried hides more slowly, though it is possible that the\r\nobserved difference may be due in many cases to the lower temperature\r\nof wells from which hard water is generally derived. In the actual\r\nlimes, the hardness of the water can have no appreciable influence,\r\nthough if sodium sulphide be used alone, a certain waste occurs from\r\ntemporary hardness, which may render it advisable to add a little lime.\r\nIt is in the washing of the hides from lime that the influence is first\r\ndistinctly felt. If limey goods, after unhairing, are placed in a water\r\nwith much temporary hardness, the same action occurs as in Clark's\r\nwater softening process, and chalk is deposited in the surface of the\r\nhides, making them harsh and apt to \"frize\" or roughen the grain in\r\nscudding, and causing bad colour by combining with the organic acids\r\nof the liquors. The common, but not wholly satisfactory, expedient is\r\nto add a little lime, or better, a few pailfuls of lime liquor to the\r\nwater before putting in the hides. The best plan is to use a properly\r\nsoftened water. Permanent hardness is not injurious in this way.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of water, and the dissolved carbonic acid which it\r\ncontains, are, together with its temperature, the principal factors\r\nwhich determine whether a hide will plump or fall in it. Almost\r\nthe only accurate investigation of this point has been made by W.\r\nEitner ('Der Gerber,' iii. 183). He placed pieces of hide, unhaired\r\nby sweating, and quite flat and fallen, in water for 4 days at a\r\ntemperature of 46° F. (8° C.), with the following results:--\r\n\r\n  1. In distilled water                           Scarcely at all plumped.\r\n\r\n  2. \"  water saturated with CO_{2}                Well plumped.\r\n\r\n  3. \"    \"   with lime bicarbonate, 20° German }\r\n                     scale of hardness          } Tolerably plump.\r\n\r\n  4. \"    \"    \"   magnesia bicarbonate, 20° do.     do.     do.\r\n\r\n  5. \"    \"    \"   lime sulphate, 20° do.         Well plumped.\r\n\r\n  6. \"    \"    \"   magnesia sulphate, 20° do.     Best plumped.\r\n\r\n  7. \"    \"    \"   magnesium chloride, 20° do.    Not at all plumped.\r\n\r\n  8. \"    \"    \"   common salt, 20° do.               do.      do.\r\n\r\n     (1 German degree of hardness corresponds to 1 of lime in 100,000.)\r\n\r\nThe peculiarities which were shown by the hide pieces on removal\r\nfrom the water were maintained throughout the tanning, which was\r\nconducted in imitation of the German method, the hide being swollen\r\nand coloured through in weak birch-bark liquors, made with distilled\r\nwater and acidified in each case with equal quantities of lactic\r\nacid, and finally laid away till tanned in a mixture of oak bark and\r\nvalonia. No. 6, from magnesia sulphate, was the best; then No. 2; No.\r\n3 was less good, but all the pieces from 1 to 6 were firm, close,\r\nand of good substance and texture, No. 1 having swelled well in the\r\nsour liquor. On the other hand, 7 and 8 scarcely swelled in liquor,\r\nbut remained flat throughout, and were looser, thinner, and of finer\r\nfibre. From this experiment it is clear that while sulphates and\r\ncarbonates exert a favourable influence on plumping, chlorides do the\r\nreverse, not only not plumping themselves, but placing the hides in an\r\nunfavourable condition for the plumping action of acids in the liquors.\r\nThese experiments are quite borne out by the writer's experience in\r\npractice. The water at the Lowlights Tannery, which in dry weather\r\nis mostly obtained from beds of what was originally sea-sand, and\r\nwhich consequently contains a very abnormal proportion of chlorides\r\n(up to 68 pts. NaCl per 100,000), requires special and very careful\r\nmanagement to make thick leather, notwithstanding its containing a\r\nconsiderable quantity of calcium and magnesium sulphates. These facts\r\nalso indicate the importance of the thorough removal of salt from hides\r\nintended for sole-leather. Plumping is not a desirable thing in leather\r\nintended for dressing purposes, and it is possible that the use of a\r\nsmall percentage of salt in the liquors or wash waters might enable\r\nbating to be dispensed with. Like a bate, salt would dissolve a small\r\nproportion of hide substance (see p. 19). There is no practicable means\r\nof removing chlorides from water, but Eitner suggests the addition of\r\na small quantity of sulphuric acid to water containing much temporary\r\nhardness (bicarbonates), by which it is converted into permanent\r\n(sulphates), which, as we have seen, plumps better. For this purpose\r\nabout 2·8 oz. of ordinary English vitriol (sp. gr. 1·490) per 100 cub.\r\nft. of water is required for each part of lime Ca(OH)_{2} per 100,000\r\n(see p. 97 for testing of water). A simpler guide is to add enough to\r\npurple, but not to redden litmus paper, even after moving it about in\r\nthe water for some minutes. The acid must of course be well mixed by\r\nplunging. It must be borne in mind that Eitner's experiment was on\r\nsweated hides, and that with limed hide, which is kept plump by the\r\ndissolved lime retained in the hide, the conditions are different,\r\nand different results as regards carbonic acid and bicarbonates would\r\nprobably be obtained. Both these would convert the lime in the hide\r\ninto chalk, which is both insoluble and inert, and the hide would\r\nprobably fall, at any rate till the lime was completely carbonated,\r\nwhile hides would remain plumpest in waters most free from substances\r\ncapable of neutralising lime. One of the waters most effective in\r\nplumping limed hides is that of the river at Lincoln. Its hardness\r\nand contents in chlorine is, as compared with Lowlights water in dry\r\nweather,\r\n\r\n                                                           Per 100,000.\r\n\r\n  _Lincoln_, permanent hardness 8·43, temporary 8·32, chlorine 2·60 pt.\r\n  _Lowlights_,    \"       \"    60·5,      \"    45·0      \"    41·7  \"\r\n\r\nBoth waters have a considerable quantity of organic matter, and both\r\nowe their hardness in part to magnesia. From this we might conclude,\r\nwhat may be _à priori_ expected, that the softer the water, the plumper\r\nlimed hides remain in it. I am informed, however, by Mr. S. L. Evans,\r\nthat in the Dartmoor water, which is very soft, but peaty, hides fall\r\nrapidly. In this case the colouring matters of the peat, which are\r\nof the nature of very weak acids, probably neutralise the lime. It\r\nmay also be remarked, that wherever the conditions of putrefaction or\r\ndecaying organic matter is present, hides rapidly fall, for the same\r\nreasons as they do in a bate.\r\n\r\nWhile the injurious effect of bicarbonates on limed hide is matter of\r\ncommon experience, their influence on liquors and tanning is not so\r\nwell understood. It is certain that they neutralise and combine with\r\nthe organic acids of the liquors, and probably with some species of\r\ntannin, and as 1 part per 100,000 amounts to 1 oz. per 100 cub. ft.,\r\nthe acid required to neutralise a very hard water amounts to something\r\nconsiderable. It is well known that hard waters make bad tea, and the\r\ninfluence of hardness on the extraction of tannin is a subject well\r\nworthy of investigation, and which the writer hopes to examine.\r\n\r\nOn dyeing, at least as regards dye-woods, the influence of bicarbonates\r\nis distinctly favourable, and this is also stated to be true of woad,\r\ncochineal, and indigo-carmine.\r\n\r\nBeside lime and magnesia salts, water may contain sulphates and\r\nchlorides of soda and potash; but not carbonates of these bases in\r\npresence of permanent hardness. In soft waters carbonates are sometimes\r\npresent, and form carbonate of lime in limed hides. Hides are said\r\nto soften rapidly in such water. Alkaline sulphates are not known to\r\nhave any injurious action, and chlorides have already been spoken of.\r\nIron may be present in solution as bicarbonate, but not in any other\r\nform in presence of bicarbonate of lime. It is removed completely with\r\nthe temporary hardness by Clark's process, or boiling. Iron is much\r\nmore common merely in suspension, as mud, but is always objectionable.\r\nMost waters contain a little silicic acid and alumina, and some few\r\nconsiderable quantities. Such waters are said to harden leather, but\r\nthe writer knows of no case where they are in use in England; and their\r\noccurrence is comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nFor comparison, analyses of a few spring and river waters are given on\r\np. 89.\r\n\r\nAnalyses of various Waters.\r\n\r\n  ────────────┬───────┬─────────┬───────┬───────────┬─────────┬──────────┐\r\n              │Thames,│ Thames, │Severn,│ Thirlmere.│ Rhine,  │ Spring,  │\r\n              │at Kew.│ at      │Wales. │           │ Basle.  │ Witley,  │\r\n              │       │ London  │       │           │         │ Surrey.  │\r\n              │       │ Bridge. │       │           │         │          │\r\n  ────────────┼───────┼─────────┼───────┼───────────┼─────────┼──────────┤\r\n  Total solids│ 31·0  │  40·8   │  3·87 │    5·15   │  16·9   │   7·6    │\r\n  Ca          │  7·6  │}  8·21  │{  ·3  │     ·43   │   5·55  │    ·81   │\r\n  Mg          │   ·47 │}        │{  ·2  │     ·12   │    ·48  │    ·18   │\r\n  Na          │   ·87 │   1·43  │   ·6  │     ·49   │    ·06  │    ·64   │\r\n  K           │   ·39 │    ·17  │   ·1  │      ..   │    ..   │    ·23   │\r\n  CO_{3}      │ 10·53 │   6·94  │   ·2  │    1·09   │   8·62  │   trace  │\r\n  SO_{4}      │  3·95 │   3·22  │  1·3  │     ·75   │   1·54  │   1·33   │\r\n  Cl          │  1·21 │   6·36  │   ·8  │    1·1    │    ·15  │   1·28   │\r\n  SiO_{2}     │   ·63 │    ·18  │   ·2  │     ·07   │    ·21  │   1·23   │\r\n  Temporary   │}      │         │       │           │         │          │\r\n   Hardness   │}20·0  │    ..   │   ·9  │     ·7    │     ..  │   2·8    │\r\n  Permanent   │}      │         │       │           │         │          │\r\n  hardness    │       │         │       │           │         │          │\r\n  ────────────┴───────┴─────────┴───────┴───────────┴─────────┴──────────┘\r\n\r\n  ────────────┬────────┬─────────┬─────────┬────────┬────────┬───────────┐\r\n              │Spring, │Artesian,│Ripley's,│ Well,  │River   │Beamhouse  │\r\n              │Watford,│Well     │Well     │ Council│Witham, │ well,     │\r\n              │Herts.  │Trafalgar│Holbeck, │ Acad., │Lincoln.│ Lowlights.│\r\n              │        │Square.  │Yorks.   │ Vienna.│        │           │\r\n  ────────────┼────────┼─────────┼─────────┼────────┼────────┼───────────┤\r\n  Total solids│ 33·8   │  84·9   │ 150·4   │  212·2 │  33·0  │    ..     │\r\n  Ca          │ 11·0   │   1·56  │   1·22  │   19·6 │   6·08 │    ..     │\r\n  Mg          │  ..    │    ·84  │    ·42  │   10·4 │   ..   │    ..     │\r\n  Na          │  1·1   │  29·4   │  58·1   │   41·1 │   ..   │    ..     │\r\n  K           │  ..    │    ·85  │    ·83  │   10·5 │   ..   │    ..     │\r\n  CO_{3}      │ 15·6   │  11·3   │  39·8   │   97·6 │   ..   │    ..     │\r\n  SO_{4}      │   ·68  │  20·6   │   1·03  │   26·7 │   7·59 │    ..     │\r\n  Cl          │  1·21  │  16·5   │  45·2   │    3·5 │   2·60 │   21·8    │\r\n  SiO_{2}     │  1·16  │    ·57  │   2·63  │     ·3 │   ..   │    ..     │\r\n  Temporary   │        │         │         │        │        │           │\r\n   hardness   │   ..   │    ..   │    ..   │    ..  │{ 8·0   │   39·7    │\r\n  Permanent   │        │         │         │        │        │           │\r\n   hardness   │   ..   │    ..   │    ..   │    ..  │{ 8·4   │   48·0    │\r\n  ────────────┴────────┴─────────┴─────────┴────────┴────────┴───────────┘\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF CHEMICAL ANALYSIS FOR THE TANNERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that the reader has an elementary knowledge of chemistry,\r\nand of the common manipulations of the laboratory; but at the risk of\r\ngiving information which to many is already familiar, the principles\r\nthat underlie those methods of testing which are most applicable to\r\ntechnical purposes must be briefly explained.\r\n\r\n_Standard Solutions._--If 40 _grm._ of pure caustic soda (NaHO) be\r\ndissolved in water, and a little tincture of litmus added, it will be\r\ncoloured a bright blue. If hydrochloric acid be now added, drop by\r\ndrop, the litmus will at last become purple, and a single drop more\r\nwould turn it a bright red. At this point the liquid is neither acid\r\nnor alkaline, and if it be evaporated to dryness, nothing will be left\r\nbut 58·5 _grm._ of common salt (NaCl), while 18 _grm._ of water will\r\nbe formed and have escaped. We have therefore used exactly 36·5 _grm._\r\nof pure HCl, and if we dissolve 40 _grm._ of caustic soda in 1 _litre_\r\nof water, and 36·5 _grm._ of pure HCl in another, equal parts of these\r\nliquids will always exactly neutralise each other, forming nothing\r\nbut common salt and water. It will be obvious that if we have a soda\r\nsolution of the strength named, we can find the amount of hydrochloric\r\nacid in any solution of unknown strength, by seeing how much of it\r\nis required to neutralise, say, 10 _c.c._ (= 0·4 _grm._ soda) of the\r\nknown solution. Instead of 40 _grm._ of caustic soda, we may take 56\r\n_grm._ of potash to the _litre_, and it will exactly neutralise an\r\nequal volume of the hydrochloric solution containing 36·5 _grm._ If,\r\nagain, we make a solution containing 49 _grm._ of pure sulphuric\r\nacid (SO_{4}H_{2}) per _litre_, it will neutralise an exactly equal\r\nvolume of either the soda or the potash solution, thus being precisely\r\nequivalent to the HCl solution. Such solutions are called normal, and\r\nany normal acid solution will neutralise an equal volume of any normal\r\nalkali, and _vice versâ_. For many purposes normal solutions are too\r\nstrong, and solutions containing 1/10 of the quantities required for\r\nnormal solution are preferable; such solutions are called decinormal.\r\nAll solutions containing known quantities of chemicals, and intended\r\nfor use in volumetric analysis, are called Standard solutions.\r\n\r\n_Indicators._--The tincture of litmus used to show when the solution\r\nis exactly neutral is called an indicator, and many materials are\r\nused in a similar way in different analytical processes. Thus the\r\nindigo solution in Löwenthal's process is an indicator. A more useful\r\nindicator than litmus for tannery purposes is Dr. Lunge's \"methyl\r\norange,\" which is indifferent to carbonic acid, and may therefore be\r\nused in the cold with solutions of alkaline carbonates; which are much\r\nmore easily made and preserved than those of the caustic alkalies\r\nnecessary with litmus. It is very sensitive to mineral acids, but not\r\nequally so to organic. It may be obtained of Messrs. Mawson and Swan,\r\nof Newcastle; and as a minute quantity only must be used for each\r\ntest, it is really cheaper than litmus, and a few _grm._ will last a\r\nlifetime. It must be dissolved in water, and not more than 2 or 3 drops\r\ntaken for each titration. (Titration signifies an estimation by means\r\nof a standard solution.) Other indicators will be named in connection\r\nwith the analytical methods in which they are used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n_Instruments._--To practically carry out analysis by standard\r\nsolutions, measuring glasses are required. One or more flasks marked\r\nin the neck to hold exact quantities (Fig. 9), one at least, holding\r\n1 _litre_, are indispensable. One or two graduated cylinders (Fig.\r\n10), holding 100 _c.c._, and divided into tenths of _c.c._, are very\r\nuseful, and it is well also to have one holding a _litre_, and provided\r\nwith a stopper (Fig. 11). This is called a \"test mixer,\" but is not\r\nabsolutely essential.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\nPipettes (Fig. 12) are tubes with a mark on the stem by which exact\r\nquantities of liquid can be taken. Several holding 5, 10, 20, and 25\r\n_c.c._ are necessary, and one holding 10 _c.c._ and divided into tenths\r\nis advisable. Most important of all is the burette (Fig. 13). If only\r\none is to be had, it must be a Mohr's burette with a glass tap, but as\r\nalkaline solutions are apt to set glass taps fast, it is well to have\r\none with a tap, and another with a pinchcock (Fig. 14). They should\r\nhold 50 or 25 _c.c._ and be divided into tenths. The burette in use is\r\nfixed in a stand (Fig. 15) and filled up to the top of the graduation,\r\nand the quantity of solution delivered is then shown by the scale. It\r\nis usual to read by the under side of the hollow of the liquid, keeping\r\nthe eye carefully level with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\nA chemical balance suitable for the preparation of standard solutions\r\nand general analytical use, is shown in Fig. 16. The beam is provided\r\nwith steel or rock-crystal knife-edges at the centre, which are\r\nsupported on agate planes, and similar edges _a_ support the pans.\r\nExcept at the moment of weighing, the beam, and in good balances the\r\npans also (at _b_), are steadied by supports raised by turning the\r\nmilled head _c_. The long pointer _d_ moving over a scale, shows when\r\nthe beam is horizontal; but the weighing is performed, not by waiting\r\ntill the balance comes to rest, but by noting when the oscillations\r\nare equal on each side of the zero point. The _weights_, which should\r\nrun from 50 _grm._ downwards, are usually of brass (preferably gilded)\r\ndown to 1 _grm._, while the fractions to 0·01 _grm._ are of platinum\r\nfoil. Milligrammes and fractions are weighed by a \"rider\" of wire\r\nweighing 0·01 _grm._, and moved along the beam (which is graduated for\r\nthe purpose like a steelyard) by the arms _e_. A fair balance should\r\nturn distinctly with 0·001 _grm._, and a good one with 0·0001 _grm._\r\nIf equal weights are placed on each pan, they should of course balance,\r\nand if changed side for side the balance should be maintained. If not,\r\nthe arms of the beam are unequal. Weights always have trifling errors,\r\nbut if by a really good maker, these are generally so small that they\r\nmay be disregarded except in very delicate researches. The weights\r\nshould always be placed on the scale in regular order, beginning with\r\nthe heaviest, and it is well to accustom oneself to reading the weight\r\nby the vacant places in the box as well as by the weights on the scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.]\r\n\r\nWhile of course it is most important, and for accurate work essential,\r\nto have as good a balance as possible, much may be done in technical\r\nwork, even with a good pair of druggists' scales; and most standard\r\nsolutions may be bought ready made; while from two or three accurately\r\nadjusted solutions many others may be made volumetrically.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Standard Acid and Alkaline Solutions._--In practice\r\nit is very difficult to obtain perfectly pure caustic soda, free from\r\nwater and carbonic acid, both of which are greedily absorbed by it from\r\nthe air, so that a standard solution cannot practically be made by\r\ndirectly weighing out the substance as suggested in the introductory\r\nparagraph. In sodic carbonate, however, we have a substance which is\r\neasily obtained pure and dry, and which may be used for almost all the\r\npurposes to which a caustic solution could be applied. A decinormal\r\nsolution is strong enough for most of the work in a tannery, though it\r\nis a convenience to have both normal and decinormal, and a stock of the\r\nstronger solution will last a longer time and is readily diluted to\r\ndecinormal strength by adding 1 part to 9 parts of distilled water. To\r\nmake a normal solution, about 60 _grm._ of the purest sodic carbonate\r\nare placed in a porcelain basin or platinum crucible and heated over\r\na Bunsen gas-burner or spirit-lamp, nearly to redness, and allowed\r\nto cool closely covered up. Of the salt thus dried 53 _grm._ are\r\naccurately weighed into a beaker and dissolved in distilled water. The\r\nsolution is then poured into a gauged _litre_ flask, and carefully\r\nfilled up with water at a temperature of 59° F. (15° C.) to the mark on\r\nthe neck. The whole is then poured into a good-sized stoppered bottle\r\n(40 oz.) and vigorously shaken for 5-10 minutes. This thorough shaking\r\nis important with all standard solutions, and without experience no\r\none would believe how much shaking is required uniformly to mix a\r\nsolution. Probably more difficulty to beginners in analysis arises from\r\nneglect of this matter than from any other cause. To make a decinormal\r\nsolution, proceed in precisely the same way, using 5·3 _grm._ instead\r\nof 53; or dilute as above.\r\n\r\n_Standard Acid Solution._--For this purpose any one of several acids\r\nmay be used, each of which has its special advantages.\r\n\r\nOxalic acid is the easiest to make of any. A sufficient quantity of\r\npure crystallised oxalic acid is powdered and pressed between filter\r\npaper, so as to absorb the moisture which occasionally is retained\r\nin cavities of the crystals. 6·3 _grm._ is then weighed out and\r\ndissolved in water, exactly as was done with sodic carbonate, forming\r\na decinormal solution. It is used in Löwenthal's tannin estimation\r\nprocess and may also be employed to determine alkalies, but forms\r\ninsoluble calcium oxalate with lime salts, and does not give a sharp\r\nreaction with methyl orange indicator. Hence litmus must be used, or a\r\nfew drops of a neutral solution of calcium chloride added to the methyl\r\norange, when hydrochloric acid will be liberated as soon as there\r\nis excess of the acid, and the indicator will be promptly reddened.\r\nSulphuric acid is the most permanent of any acid solution, and may be\r\ngenerally employed. It forms insoluble sulphates with lime, baryta, and\r\nstrontia. To make a normal solution, 35 _c.c._ of the pure concentrated\r\nacid are poured into at least 3 or 4 times as much distilled water,\r\nand allowed to cool, and are then made up to about 1 _litre_ and well\r\nshaken. The burette is filled with the mixture, 10 _c.c._ of the\r\nstandard sodic carbonate are measured into a beaker, 2 or 3 drops of\r\nmethyl orange solution are added, and the acid is run in with constant\r\nstirring till the indicator is just beginning to redden. This must be\r\nrepeated, and the two titrations should exactly agree. Suppose that\r\n9.5 _c.c._ are required, then 950 _c.c._ of the trial acid are equal\r\nto 1 _litre_ of the soda. If therefore 950 _c.c._ be measured into a\r\ntest mixer, and made up to 1 _litre_, the solution should be accurately\r\ndecinormal. Of course great care must be used in the whole process.\r\nIf a gauged flask only is at hand it will be easier to measure into\r\nit the water required to make up the _litre_, and then fill to the\r\nmark with the trial acid. Normal hydrochloric acid may be made exactly\r\nas described for sulphuric acid, but using about 100 _c.c._ of the\r\nstrongest acid. Decinormal solutions of both these acids may be made by\r\nthe same methods; using 1 tenth the quantities, or by dilution of the\r\nnormal solution.\r\n\r\nBeside comparison with sodic carbonate solution, hydrochloric acid\r\nmay also be checked by determining the amount of chlorine present,\r\nwith silver nitrate (see p. 98) 10 _c.c._ of decinormal acid should of\r\ncourse be equal to 10 _c.c._ of decinormal silver nitrate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable giving the Quantity of the Following Substances contained in or\r\nequivalent to 1 _litre_ of Normal or 10 _litres_ of Decinormal Standard\r\nSolution.\r\n\r\n     Sulphuric acid             49 _grm._ SO_{4}H_{2} = 40 _grm._ SO_{3}\r\n     Hydrochloric acid          36·5  \"   ClH = 35·5 _grm._ Cl.\r\n  [G]Oxalic acid                63·0  \"   C_{2}O_{4}H_{2} + 2 Aq.\r\n     Acetic  \"                  60·0  \"   C_{2}H_{3}O_{2}H.\r\n     Soda                       40·0  \"   NaHO.\r\n     Sodic carbonate            53·0  \"   Na_{2}CO_{3}.\r\n  [G]Lime                       28·0  \"   CaO = 37·0 _grm._ CaH_{2}O_{2}.\r\n  [G]Calcic carbonate           50·0  \"   CaCO_{3}.\r\n     Ammonia                    17·0  \"   NH_{3}.\r\n  [G]Barium hydrate             76·5  \"   BaO = 85·5 _grm._ BaH_{2}O_{2}.\r\n     Barium chloride           104·0  \"   BaCl_{2}.\r\n     Zinc chloride or sulphate  32·6  \"   Zn = 16·0 _grm._ S. as sulphide.\r\n     Silver nitrate            170·0  \"   AgNO_{3} = 35·5 _grm._ Cl.\r\n     Potassic permanganate      31·6  \"   K_{2}MnO_{4}.\r\n\r\n[Footnote G: Insufficiently soluble in water to form a normal solution.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF WATER.\r\n\r\n_Hardness_ (Hehner's process). (_a_) Temporary Hardness.--As has\r\nbeen stated (p. 84), this consists of lime and magnesia carbonates.\r\nAs methyl orange is not affected by carbonic acid, bicarbonates of\r\nalkaline earths have an alkaline reaction, and may be estimated in\r\nsolution by standard acid like the alkalies themselves. 100 _c.c._,\r\nor in soft waters 200 _c.c._, of the water is measured into a beaker,\r\na drop or two of solution of methyl orange added, and decinormal\r\nhydrochloric or sulphuric acid run in from the burette with constant\r\nstirring till the colour just changes to pink. This is repeated, and\r\nthe average taken. The two determinations should not at the most differ\r\nmore than 1/10 _c.c._ Each _c.c._ represents 5 parts per 100,000 of\r\nCaCO_{3} or 2·8 parts of CaO; or corresponding quantities of magnesia\r\n(4·2 parts of MgCO_{3} or 2 parts MgO), when 100 _c.c._ of water are\r\nused.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Permanent Hardness.--200 _c.c._ are measured into a beaker and\r\nboiled for 15 minutes with 40 _c.c._ decinormal sodic carbonate. The\r\nmixture is then allowed to cool and made up to 250 _c.c._; or the flask\r\nand its contents may be weighed before boiling and made up again to the\r\nsame weight. It is then filtered, and 60 _c.c._ representing 50 _c.c._\r\nof the original water, is twice titrated with decinormal acid and the\r\nresult added. If the water were pure, exactly 10 _c.c._ should be\r\nrequired to neutralise the 10 _c.c._ of sodic carbonate, but if there\r\nbe permanent hardness a part of the sodic carbonate will be already\r\nneutralised with the acids of the lime and magnesia salts, which have\r\nbeen precipitated as carbonates together with the carbonates of these\r\nbases originally present in the water. The hardness will therefore be\r\nrepresented by the loss, i. e. the number of _c.c._ of acid used for\r\n100 _c.c._ of the original water must be subtracted from 20 and the\r\nremainder calculated as before, or if calculated as sulphates, each\r\n_c.c._ represents 6·8 parts of CaSO_{4} or 6 parts of MgSO_{4} per\r\n100,000. If, as is sometimes the case, more acid is required than is\r\nneeded for the sodic carbonate used, the excess corresponds to sodic\r\ncarbonate originally present in the water. In this case there can be no\r\npermanent hardness.\r\n\r\n_Chlorine in Water._--If silver nitrate be added to a solution of any\r\nchloride, the silver is precipitated as white curdy insoluble silver\r\nchloride. As indicator, a few drops of neutral potassic chromate are\r\nused. So long as any chloride is present the red silver chromate\r\nwhich forms is at once decomposed, and the silver converted into\r\nwhite chloride. But as soon as all the chloride is exhausted, the\r\nred chromate becomes permanent. To prepare a standard decinormal\r\nsolution of silver, 17 _grm._ of pure recrystallised silver nitrate are\r\ndissolved in 1 _litre_ of distilled water. To perform the estimation\r\n50 _c.c._ of water are measured into a beaker, 2 or 3 drops of strong\r\nsolution of pure yellow potassic chromate are added, and then silver\r\nnitrate from the burette till a permanent red is formed. This is\r\nrepeated, and the results are added together, representing 100 _c.c._\r\nof water. Each _c.c._ of silver nitrate used represents 3·55 parts of\r\nchlorine, or 5·85 parts of sodic chloride per 100,000. If more than 10\r\n_c.c._ of silver solution are required to 50 _c.c._, it is advisable\r\nto use a smaller quantity of water. If the process be applied to\r\nother liquids than natural water, it must be borne in mind that the\r\nsolution must not contain free acids or alkalies except carbonic acid.\r\nIf this is not the case the liquid may be rendered faintly alkaline,\r\nwith lime-water free from chlorides, and the excess of lime removed by\r\npassing carbonic acid through it; or it may be slightly acidified with\r\nsulphuric acid, and shaken with a little pure precipitated calcic or\r\nbaric carbonate.\r\n\r\n_Detection of other Impurities._--Sulphuric acid (as sulphates) is\r\nseldom wholly absent, but its presence may be proved, by adding excess\r\nof barium chloride to the water slightly acidified with hydrochloric\r\nacid (2-3 _c.c._ of saturated solution of BaCl_{2} are sufficient for\r\nany ordinary water); if the mixture be allowed to stand overnight in a\r\n100 _c.c._ cylinder beside a solution containing a known, and not very\r\ndifferent quantity of decinormal sulphuric acid, the quantity present\r\nmay be roughly compared by measuring the bulk of the precipitates.\r\n\r\nLime may be similarly detected and roughly measured by precipitation\r\nwith excess of ammonic oxalate in presence of ammonium chloride, to\r\nhinder precipitation of magnesia. Lime-water, which may be used as a\r\nstandard, contains about 128 parts of lime per 100,000.\r\n\r\nMagnesia is detected by adding ammonium phosphate to the filtrate from\r\nthe precipitated oxalate of lime. If the mixture be allowed to stand\r\nin a warm place for 24 hours all the magnesia will be precipitated as\r\nammonio-magnesic phosphate.\r\n\r\nSilica, &c.--100 _c.c._ of the water is acidified with a little HCl\r\nevaporated to dryness, moistened with HCl, and treated with a little\r\nhot water. The silica or silicic acid is left undissolved. The solution\r\nfrom which the silicic acid has been filtered off is evaporated to\r\nsmall bulk and ammonia added, when iron will be precipitated as brown\r\nferric oxide, which is coloured black by tannin or tanning liquor.\r\nIf copper be present it will give a blue solution with the ammonia.\r\nIron may also be recognised by evaporating the water to small bulk\r\nwith a trace of HCl, and adding a little sodium acetate, when if\r\niron be present it will be coloured black by tannin, red by ammonium\r\nsulphocyanide, and blue by potassium ferrocyanide (prussiate of\r\npotash). Its quantity may be estimated (Thomson, Chem. Soc. Abstracts,\r\nMay 1885) by measuring 100 _c.c._ of the water to be tested and 100\r\n_c.c._ distilled water into two similar cylinders, adding to each 5\r\n_c.c._ of dilute hydrochloric acid (1:5) and 15 _c.c._ of a solution\r\nof potassium sulphocyanide (40 _grm._ per _litre_), and then adding to\r\nthe distilled water cylinder a very dilute standard solution of ferric\r\nsalt, till its colour matches the other. If the iron contained in the\r\nwater is in the ferrous condition, it must be oxidised with potassic\r\npermanganate before testing.\r\n\r\nA suitable ferric standard solution may be made by dissolving 0·1\r\n_grm._ of clean, bright, soft iron wire in a little hydrochloric acid\r\nin a long-necked flask, adding nitric acid so long as red fumes are\r\nproduced, evaporating nearly to dryness, and making up to 1 _litre_\r\n(more accurately 996 _c.c._). Each _c.c._ will then equal 0·0001 _grm._\r\nFe.\r\n\r\nLead (and copper) may be detected by passing sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nthrough the water acidified with HCl, or by adding a drop of fresh\r\nammonium or sodium sulphide to the slightly acidified water, when a\r\nbrownish coloration clearly visible in a deep beaker set on a sheet of\r\nwhite paper will be produced. Iron also gives a black with sulphides in\r\nalkaline solution. Copper may be distinguished from lead by the blue\r\ngiven with ammonia, and by a reddish-brown precipitate with potassium\r\nferrocyanide.\r\n\r\nFor accurate quantitative estimation of these impurities, the regular\r\nworks on the subject, such as Thorpe's 'Quantitative Analysis,'\r\nSutton's 'Volumetric Analysis,' or Fresenius' 'Quantitative Analysis,'\r\nmust be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF COMMERCIAL ACIDS.\r\n\r\n_Sulphuric acid_ 10 _grm._ may be made up to 100 _c.c._ and well\r\nmixed, and of this 10 _c.c._ may be tested with normal sodic carbonate\r\nin presence of methyl orange. Each 1 _c.c._ of soda solution used\r\ncorresponds to 0·049 _grm._ or 4·9 per cent. of H_{2}SO_{4}. For most\r\npurposes, the strength may be ascertained from the specific gravity, as\r\nmeasured by a hydrometer or weighed in a specific gravity bottle.

Iron is detected on neutralising\r\nwith soda or ammonia, when it falls as a yellowish precipitate, which\r\nmay be recognised by the ordinary tests (p. 100). Nitric and nitrous\r\nacids are detected by pouring a strong solution of ferrous sulphate\r\ncautiously on to the top of the strong cold acid, when a dark ring is\r\nformed at the junction of the two liquids.\r\n\r\n_Hydrochloric acid_ may be tested with soda solution like sulphuric. 1\r\n_c.c._ of normal soda = 0·0365 _grm._ or 3·65 per cent.

The end-reaction with methyl orange is rendered\r\nsharper by the addition of a few drops of neutral calcic chloride\r\ntowards the end of the titration.\r\n\r\n_Acetic acid_ may be similarly determined, each _c.c._ of normal alkali\r\nbeing equivalent to 0·06 _grm._ of C_{2}H_{4}O_{2}. Caustic soda, or\r\nlime-water and litmus, give sharper results than sodic carbonate and\r\nmethyl orange. Brown pyroligneous acid is difficult to test from the\r\ndark compounds formed with soda, but may be indirectly determined\r\nby the quantity of marble, baric carbonate, or magnesia which it\r\nwill dissolve (compare p. 100), or very possibly by lime-water like\r\ntan-liquors with a little tannin as indicator.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF LIME AND LIME-LIQUORS.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of caustic lime in either quicklime or lime-bottoms may\r\nbe determined by weighing a quantity of the finely powdered material\r\ncontaining not more than 1 _grm._ of caustic lime, and shaking it\r\nthoroughly with 1 _litre_ of distilled water and filtering. 100 _c.c._\r\nshould be taken, and decinormal acid, sulphuric or hydrochloric (or\r\nif oxalic, with addition of neutral calcic chloride, or with litmus\r\ninstead of methyl orange as indicator). Each _c.c._ of decinormal\r\nacid corresponds to 0·0028 _grm._ of CaO. If the filter and residue\r\nbe treated with sufficient normal acid to dissolve the whole of the\r\ncarbonates, and then titrated back with normal sodic carbonate and\r\nmethyl orange, the loss (less soda solution required than acid was\r\noriginally employed) is equal to the carbonate of lime and carbonate\r\nand hydrate of magnesia present. 1 _c.c._ of normal acid = 0·05 _grm._\r\nof CaCO_{3}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\nLime-water and lime-liquors may be titrated as above, with sulphuric\r\nor hydrochloric acid and methyl orange; but in the latter case ammonia\r\n(and if soda ash or \"Inoffensive\" is used, soda and potash also),\r\nand the lime salts of weak organic acids will be estimated with it.\r\nIt is difficult to get a sharp end-reaction in old liquors from the\r\norganic acids (caproic, amidocaproic, &c.) present. To determine the\r\nammonia, 50-100 _c.c._ of the liquor may be distilled in a small\r\nretort or flask, and the escaping NH_{3} collected in a =U=-tube or\r\n\"nitrogen bulb\" (Fig. 17), containing 20-50 _c.c._ of normal acid,\r\nwhich is afterwards titrated back with sodic carbonate and methyl\r\norange. Kathreiner employs the arrangement shown in Fig. 18. 30 _c.c._\r\nof the liquor to be examined is placed in a shallow vessel on a piece\r\nof ground-glass, and 10 _c.c._ of normal acid in a second cup, which\r\nis supported over the other by a glass or wire triangle. The whole\r\nis covered with a small bell-glass, of which the edges are smeared\r\nwith, vaseline. At the end of 24 hours, all the ammonia will have been\r\nabsorbed by the acid, which is titrated back. The lime-liquor sample\r\nshould be drawn after well plunging the lime, and rapidly filtered into\r\na flask from a funnel covered with a clock-glass.\r\n\r\n_Determination of Gelatin and Coriin in Lime-liquors._--This cannot\r\nbe done directly, though considerable quantities of dissolved\r\nhide-substance are precipitated on acidification of the liquor with\r\nhydrochloric acid and saturation with common salt. If the liquor be\r\nneutralised with hydrochloric acid, and evaporated to dryness on the\r\nwater-bath, nitrogen may be determined in the residue by combustion,\r\nand the hide-substance calculated from it (compare p. 108). This method\r\nis serviceable in determining the amount of hide dissolved by different\r\nsolutions, or under different conditions.\r\n\r\nThe total solids of lime-liquors are estimated by evaporating 20-30\r\n_c.c._ in a porcelain crucible at 212° F. (100° C.). The organic matter\r\nis then found by igniting and determining loss (using ammonia nitrate\r\nif necessary to complete the combustion of the carbon). The ash is\r\nmostly lime carbonate. Soda, potash, and other bases may be determined\r\nin it by the usual methods, if required.\r\n\r\n\r\nESTIMATION OF SULPHUR AS SULPHIDE IN SODIUM SULPHIDE, &c.\r\n\r\n32·6 _grm._ of chemically pure zinc is dissolved in dilute sulphuric or\r\nhydrochloric acid. This is readily accomplished in a flask, if a piece\r\nof platinum foil, or a few drops of platinic chloride are added to form\r\na galvanic couple with the zinc. After solution, sufficient ammonia is\r\nadded to redissolve the precipitate at first formed,[I] and the whole\r\nis made up to 1 _litre_. Each _c.c._ = 0·016 _grm._ sulphur or 0·242\r\n_grm._ of sodic sulphide. This solution is added drop by drop from a\r\nburette to the solution of sulphide, and forms a white precipitate of\r\nzincic sulphide. The end of the reaction is known by placing a drop\r\n(with a glass rod) side by side on a piece of white filter paper,\r\nwith a drop of solution of lead acetate. So long as sulphide remains\r\nin solution, it will form a black margin of lead sulphide where the\r\ndrops touch. The drops must not be placed too close, as the solid zinc\r\nsulphide is _always_ darkened if it comes in contact with lead acetate.\r\nIt must be noted that tank-waste liquors, and many other sulphur\r\nsolutions, contain polysulphides which are estimated by zinc, but which\r\ndo not unhair, at any rate in an unaltered state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote I: If any brown residue remains, the zinc is contaminated\r\nwith iron.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL EXAMINATION OF LEATHER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\n_Estimation of Grease._--To determine oil and grease, a weighed\r\nquantity (5-10 _grm._) of the leather in fine shavings or raspings\r\nis exhausted with petroleum-ether (gasoline) in a fat-extraction\r\napparatus, of which a convenient form is represented in Fig. 19. The\r\nleather is placed in the upper vessel, of which the lower opening is\r\nloosely plugged with cotton-wool, and the petroleum-ether in the flask,\r\nwhich is gently heated in a water-bath. The petroleum-ether boils and\r\ncondenses in the inclined condenser through the casing of which a\r\nstream of cold water is passed, whence it drops back into the flask\r\nthrough the material to be exhausted. When the exhaustion is complete\r\n(when a drop of petroleum-ether from the leather leaves no grease when\r\nallowed to evaporate on a clean glass), the upper part of the apparatus\r\nis removed, and the ether is distilled off. If the flask has been\r\npreviously weighed, it is maintained in an air-bath at 212°-248° F.\r\n(100°-120° C.) for some hours, allowed to cool, and weighed, when the\r\ngain of weight is the grease and oil. Paraffin would also be extracted\r\nand reckoned, and probably traces of resin if present. Ordinary ethylic\r\nether cannot be used, since tannins and many of their products are\r\nsoluble in it. Probably carbon disulphide might be substituted. Care\r\nmust be taken to avoid explosion, as the vapours of petroleum are very\r\ncombustible. The residue left in the percolator may be examined for\r\nmatters soluble in water, by extracting again with hot distilled water,\r\nor for resins (and phlobaphenes) by extraction with alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Estimation of matters soluble in water._--This is important both to\r\ndetect weighting, and to draw conclusions as to the materials used in\r\ntanning. Fine raspings or shavings may be exhausted with warm water\r\nin a percolator, or roughly a weighed piece (20 _grm._) of leather,\r\nair-dry, may be well kneaded and worked in 100 _c.c._ of warm water\r\nin a basin. 50 _c.c._ of this may be evaporated to dryness in a light\r\nbasin over the water-bath (or under a paper hood on a steam boiler),\r\nand the gain of weight will give the amount dissolved from 10 _grm._\r\nThis is more accurate and quicker than redrying the leather and\r\nweighing loss. The residue will contain tannins and their products,\r\noften in considerable quantities, and may be examined by the table of\r\nreactions, p. 112, though these are as yet very imperfect. It will\r\nalso contain glucose, dextrin, and soluble salts, if these have been\r\nused to give weight and firmness. The absolute proof of weighting with\r\nglucose or dextrin is difficult, since tanning materials naturally\r\ncontain these and analogous principles. The residue may be powdered\r\nand exhausted with cold water, and the tannins and colouring matter\r\nremoved by shaking with magnesia (p. 108) or lead carbonate. Fehling's\r\nsolution[J] is then added and the mixture is heated nearly to boiling.\r\nA rapidly formed and considerable precipitate of red cuprous oxide\r\nindicates weighting with glucose or dextrin. Leather extracts, however,\r\ninvariably reduce Fehling's solution more or less, and a conclusion can\r\nonly be drawn after some experience and comparative tests. Gallotannic\r\nacid and pyrogallol reduce it when heated, but not cane sugar or gum\r\narabic. If a solution of cane sugar be heated to 68° C. for 1/4 hour\r\nwith 10 per cent. of fuming hydrochloric acid, it is \"inverted,\" and\r\nthen after neutralising the acid with potash or soda, will reduce\r\nFehling's solution when heated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote J: 4 _grm._ cryst. cupric sulphate are dissolved in 20 _c.c._\r\nof water; and 16 _grm._ of neutral potassic tartrate and 13 _grm._ of\r\nfused sodic hydrate are dissolved in 60 _c.c._ The two are mixed, made\r\nup to 100 _c.c._, and boiled for some minutes. It should always be\r\ntested before use by boiling a portion, which should remain perfectly\r\nclear.]\r\n\r\nThe soluble mineral salts are detected by igniting the residue left\r\nafter evaporation of a separate portion in a porcelain crucible.[K]\r\nFrom unweighted leather, the quantity is very small. The ash is\r\nexhausted with a few _c.c._ of distilled water, which will dissolve\r\nmost sulphates and chlorides, which may be detected in small portions\r\nof the solution by baric chloride and silver nitrate respectively.\r\nBaric chloride and lead acetate are precipitated by a drop of sulphuric\r\nacid, and the latter is blackened with ammonic or sodic sulphide.\r\nLime is precipitated by addition of ammonic chloride, ammonia, and\r\nammonic oxalate; magnesia by the subsequent addition of sodic phosphate\r\n(see p. 109). The carbonates in the insoluble part (mostly derived\r\nfrom salts of organic acids) may be taken up by dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid and tested separately, or the acid may be used at first. Any\r\nresidue undissolved by the acid is probably lead chloride, and will be\r\ndissolved by hot water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote K: A platinum crucible must not be used for fear of its\r\ndestruction by lead, unless this metal has been proved absent.]\r\n\r\n_Estimation of ash._--The leather in small pieces (either after or\r\nbefore extraction with water) is incinerated in a porcelain crucible.\r\nThe ash is extracted with hydrochloric acid. The insoluble portion may\r\ncontain barium sulphate (barytes), lead sulphate, sand, clay, &c. For\r\nfurther examination, ordinary chemical text-books must be consulted.\r\nAny large amount of ash indicates weighting. Müntz found only about 0·5\r\nper cent. of ash from bark-tanned leather.\r\n\r\n_Determination of hide substance._--It is sometimes of interest to\r\ndetermine the proportion of dry hide-substance in a sample of leather,\r\nbut there is no known means of doing this directly. If, however,\r\nthe leather be dried, finely powdered by rasping, and the nitrogen\r\ndetermined by combustion, either with soda-lime (Will and Varrentrapp's\r\nmethod), or with copper oxide (Dumas), the hide-substance may be\r\ncalculated, since tannin contains no nitrogen. Müntz found unhaired\r\nskin dried at 230° F. (110° C.) to contain 51·43 per cent. of nitrogen\r\n(compare also p. 20).\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINATION OF FREE ACIDS IN TAN-LIQUOR.\r\n\r\nThe lime-water method mentioned on p. 172 is, from its simplicity, well\r\nsuited for daily use in the tannery as a control method for ordinary\r\nworking; but where it is necessary to make very exact estimations, or\r\nto determine the various acids separately, it is not so satisfactory as\r\none recently published by Kohnstein and Simand (Dingl. Polyt. Jour.,\r\n1885, cclvi. 38).\r\n\r\nThe acids usually present in liquor consist of several members of the\r\nfatty or acetic group, which distil over with boiling water, of other\r\nnon-volatile organic acids, and sometimes sulphuric acid, which is\r\nadded to assist the swelling of the leather.\r\n\r\nTo determine the acids of the acetic group, Kohnstein and Simand\r\nproceed as follows:--100 _c.c._ of the liquor are distilled, in a flask\r\nor retort with a good condenser, to about 30 _c.c._, allowed to cool\r\na little, made up again to 100 _c.c._, and again distilled; and this\r\nis repeated till about 300 _c.c._ have passed over. The distillate\r\nis then made up to 300 _c.c._, well mixed by shaking, and the acid\r\nis determined with standard soda. Methyl orange and sodic carbonate\r\nis not so suitable for this titration, as caustic soda and litmus,\r\nsince methyl orange is not very sensitive to vegetable acids. If it be\r\ndesired to ascertain what quantity of acids of the acetic group exist\r\nin combination with lime and other bases in the liquor, small excess\r\nof sulphuric acid may be added to the residue in the retort, and the\r\ndistillation repeated, when the organic salts will be decomposed and\r\nthe volatile acids come over.\r\n\r\nTo determine the total free organic acids, Kohnstein and Simand shake\r\nabout 80 _c.c._ of the liquor with 3-4 _grm._ of freshly ignited\r\nmagnesia, quite free from carbonate and from lime, and allow to stand\r\nfor some hours with frequent vigorous shaking, till the liquor, which\r\nat first is brown or dirty green, becomes almost colourless and gives\r\nno reaction of either acid or tannin. The mixture is then filtered,\r\nand the tannin and colouring matter are retained on the filter in\r\ncombination with magnesia, while the organic salts of magnesia, which\r\nare mostly soluble, pass through with the filtrate. 10-30 _c.c._ of\r\nthe filtrate, according to the amount of acid present, is evaporated\r\nto dryness, and gently ignited so as not to decompose any magnesic\r\nsulphate present. The residue is moistened with water saturated with\r\ncarbonic acid, to convert any magnesic oxide into carbonate, and then\r\ndried, in order to make the mass powdery, and easier to wash, It is\r\nnext taken up with hot distilled water, filtered and well washed.\r\nAny sulphate which is present passes into the filtrate, while the\r\ncarbonate, which corresponds to the organic salts present before\r\nignition, remains on the filter, and after solution in hydrochloric\r\nacid, is estimated as magnesic pyrophosphate. To the hydrochloric\r\nsolution is added excess of ammonia and sufficient ammonic chloride\r\nto redissolve the precipitate formed, and prevent the precipitation\r\nof the magnesia; the solution is heated and then ammonic oxalate\r\nsolution, first dilute, and then concentrated, is added to precipitate\r\nany lime which may be derived from lime salts present in the liquor.\r\nAfter filtering out and washing the precipitate, 10-15 _c.c._ of 10\r\nper cent. sodic phosphate solution is added, and the liquid is stirred\r\nwith a glass rod without touching the sides of the beaker, and allowed\r\nto stand 12 hours. The crystalline precipitate is then rinsed on to\r\na filter, and washed with a mixture of 1 of ammonia and 3 of water,\r\ntill the washings no longer give any milkiness with silver nitrate.\r\nThe filter is then dried and the precipitate is placed in a platinum\r\ncrucible and first gently, and then strongly ignited with the cover on;\r\nthe filter paper, freed as much as possible from the precipitate, is\r\nburnt in the usual way on the crucible lid, the ashes are added to the\r\nprecipitate in the crucible, and the whole is again ignited and allowed\r\nto cool in the desiccator, and finally weighed. 111 parts of magnesia\r\npyrophosphate correspond to 120 parts of acetic, or 180 parts of lactic\r\nacid. Kohnstein and Simand calculate the pyrophosphate corresponding to\r\nthe acetic acid already found by distillation, and after deducting it\r\nreckon out the remainder as lactic acid. Of course the volatile acids\r\nare really a mixture consisting of acetic, propionic, butyric and other\r\nmembers of the fatty group; but it would be difficult if not impossible\r\nto separate them. Similarly other fixed acids exist in mixture beside\r\nthe lactic acid, but as their action is similar and lactic acid is\r\nalways the most abundant, these acids are to be reckoned as lactic.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that when sulphuric acid is present in the liquor\r\nit is found in the filtrate from the magnesia carbonate as sulphate.\r\nAfter removal of the lime as oxalate, as previously described, the\r\nmagnesia may be similarly determined as pyrophosphate, and reckoned\r\nout as sulphuric acid (111 parts of pyrophosphate being equal to 98\r\nparts sulphuric acid, H_{2}SO_{4}). It may also be estimated with\r\nbarium chloride, but in this case regard must be had to the sulphates\r\noriginally present in the liquor.\r\n\r\nSince waters invariably contain both lime and magnesia salts, a\r\nportion (50 or 100 _c.c._) must be evaporated, ignited, and after\r\nprecipitation of the lime, the magnesia must be estimated as already\r\ndescribed, and deducted from the amount found in a similar amount of\r\nliquor after saturating with magnesia. If, together with the organic\r\nacids, the liquor contains sulphuric acid, the correction may be\r\ndivided equally between the two.\r\n\r\nThe method is not applicable in presence of phosphoric, tartaric, or\r\noxalic acids. To overcome this difficulty, Messrs. Kohnstein and Simand\r\nare at present investigating a method dependent on decolorisation of\r\nthe liquor with bone charcoal, completely free from mineral salts, and\r\nsubsequent titration with soda.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to add the determinations of a complete set of\r\nhandlers in a Continental upper-leather tannery, in which larch bark is\r\nused. 100 _c.c._ of liquor contained as follows, in _grm._:--\r\n\r\n  ─────────┬────────────┬───────────────┬──────────────────────\r\n  No. of   │Total Acids │ Volatile Acids│  Fixed Organic Acids\r\n  Handler. │ reckoned   │  reckoned     │   reckoned as Lactic.\r\n           │ as Acetic. │  as Acetic.   │\r\n  ─────────┼────────────┼───────────────┼──────────────────────\r\n    1      │  0·205     │    0·050      │       0·232\r\n    2      │  0·628     │    0·237      │       0·586\r\n    3      │   ..       │    0·372      │        ..\r\n    4      │  0·688     │    0·426      │       0·393\r\n    5      │  0·569     │    0·432      │       0·206\r\n    6      │  0·509     │    0·453      │       0·084\r\n    7      │  0·487     │    0·456      │       0·047\r\n  ─────────┴────────────┴───────────────┴──────────────────────\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALITATIVE DETECTION OF TANNINS.\r\n\r\nIt is often desirable to determine from what tanning materials an\r\nextract or liquor is made, or with what a sample of leather is tanned.\r\nThe following table gives reactions of the principal tanning materials,\r\nwhich will enable any one of them to be recognised with certainty,\r\nand in many cases will determine the constituents in a mixture of\r\nseveral, though this is naturally far more difficult. In such cases,\r\ncolour reactions are apt to mislead, that of one tannin being modified\r\nby another, and it is safest to rely on the categorical test of\r\nprecipitate or no precipitate, coloration or no coloration, without\r\nregard to the tint. The infusions must be very weak, not exceeding\r\n1-2° Bktr., or precipitates will be formed where mere coloration or\r\nclouding is noted. In some cases only negative peculiarities can be\r\ngiven, and the material cannot be positively determined in mixture\r\nwith materials where these peculiarities are present. Thus myrobalans\r\ncould not be distinguished from divi with certainty, where any other\r\nmaterial, such as gambier, was present, which gave a deep coloration\r\nwith concentrated sulphuric acid. The writer will feel greatly obliged\r\nby the communication of more distinctive reactions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL ANALYSIS FOR THE TANNERY\r\n\r\n

of\r\ntannins, but it cannot be said that any method yet known is wholly\r\nsatisfactory. The oldest, that of Sir H. Davy, recently improved by\r\nStoddart and others, consists in precipitating with gelatin, and drying\r\nand weighing the precipitate. This is almost impossible to filter off\r\nas directed by Davy; but by the use of a little alum, and by pouring\r\nhot water on the precipitate, it becomes curdled into a mass which\r\nmay be washed by decantation. As the precipitate contains varying\r\nquantities of tannin, according to the strength of solution employed;\r\nas it is soluble in excess of gelatin solution, and as it is almost\r\nif not quite impossible to wash it free from gelatin and alum, the\r\nmethod can hardly lay claim to much accuracy. A somewhat better one\r\nconsists in the employment of a standard solution of gelatin with a\r\nlittle alum, determining the end of the reaction by filtering off a\r\nportion and ascertaining if another drop of the reagent produces a\r\nfurther precipitate. This method is very tedious, the end reaction\r\nis difficult to hit, the standard solution is very unstable, it is\r\ninapplicable to gambier and cutch because the mixture will not\r\nfilter clear, and its results are irregular, probably from the power\r\nof tannin to combine with various proportions of gelatin. A plan,\r\nwhich has a seductive appearance of simplicity, is that of Hammer;\r\nhe takes the sp. gr. of the infusion, then absorbs the tannin with\r\nslightly moistened hide-raspings, again takes the sp. gr., and from\r\nthe difference calculates the percentage of tannin, a difference of\r\n5 per cent. of tannin corresponding to one of 1·020 sp. gr. (20°\r\nbarkometer). Unfortunately the hide is more or less soluble in the\r\nliquor, and absorbs acids other than tannic with considerable energy;\r\nthe moistening of the raspings introduces an error, and the smallness\r\nof the quantity to be measured makes a slight error completely vitiate\r\nthe results. With extreme care, due corrections for temperature, for\r\nthe water introduced with the raspings, and for their solubility,\r\nand by substituting evaporation of the infusions to dryness for mere\r\ncalculation from their sp. gr., the method is useful as giving almost\r\nthe only information obtainable as to the actual weight of tannin in\r\nany material capable of being absorbed by hide. It is, however, only\r\nsuitable for use as a check on easier and more rapid methods, such as\r\nLöwenthal's, which give accurate relative results, but no information\r\nas to absolute weight of unknown tannins. A modification of Hammer's\r\nmethod has been introduced by Müntz and Ramspacher, in which the liquor\r\nwhence the tannin is to be removed is forced through a piece of raw\r\nhide by pressure. This method, except that it is more rapid, has all\r\nthe evils of Hammer's in an intensified form, and gives such variable\r\nresults as to be quite useless in practice. A set of very careful\r\ndeterminations of one sample of sumach gave results ranging from 18 to\r\n28 per cent., and similar variations occurred when the experiment was\r\nrepeated with valonia. Wagner's method by precipitation with a standard\r\nsolution of cinchonine and magenta has proved wholly unreliable.\r\n\r\nGerland's method with a volumetric solution of tartar emetic, used in\r\npresence of ammonic chloride, gives constant results with sumachs,\r\n2/3 of those given by permanganate and Neubauer's equivalent.\r\nTartar emetic does not precipitate the tannins of cutch and gambier.\r\nFleck's, by precipitation with copper acetate, and subsequent washing\r\nwith ammonic carbonate and gravimetric estimation, either of the\r\ntannate dried at 212° F. (100° C.), or of the copper oxide left\r\non ignition; and Carpene's, by precipitation with ammoniacal zinc\r\nacetate, and subsequent estimation with permanganate and indigo,\r\nthough giving fairly accurate results on some tannins, are only of\r\nlimited application. They may therefore be passed over, as well as\r\nJean's method with a volumetric solution of iodine in presence of sodic\r\ncarbonate, and Allen's method with lead acetate, which are tedious and\r\ndifficult, and present no advantage over Löwenthal's improved process.\r\nThis last is easy of execution, constant in results, and universally\r\napplicable. Before proceeding to describe it in detail, it may be well\r\nto give some hints as to the best modes of sampling and preparing\r\ntanning materials for analysis, since this is often more difficult and\r\ntedious than the actual analysis.\r\n\r\nSampling.--Samples should always be drawn from at least 10 sacks or\r\nseparate parts of the bulk, and, in the case of valonia, special\r\ncare should be taken to have a fair average quantity of \"beard.\"\r\nNo attention is usually paid to this point by merchants, and the\r\nproportion varies greatly in different parts of the same cargo. If\r\nseveral sacks are spread in layers on a level floor, and then portions\r\ngoing quite to the ground are taken from several parts of the floor,\r\nthis will be accomplished. Where samples must be dealt with which have\r\nnot been specially drawn, it might be safest to weigh out from each the\r\nsame proportion of beard and whole cups, bearing in mind that the beard\r\nis always the richest part of the valonia. In sampling myrobalans, it\r\nshould be remembered that the poor and light nuts will rise to the\r\ntop, and hence the hand should be plunged well into the sack. Grinding\r\nof valonia and myrobalans when practicable is probably best done in a\r\nsmall disintegrator, fitted with gratings. The material, of which some\r\npounds must be used, is screened over a sieve of say 15 wires per in.,\r\nand all coarser parts are returned to the mill till they will pass. The\r\nmill must grind into a close box, that no dust may be lost. Bark may\r\nbe reduced to fine saw-dust by cutting a portion of each piece in the\r\nsample with a circular saw or rasp driven by a lathe. The advantage of\r\nthese methods is that samples can be ground without previous drying,\r\nand thus in many cases time may be saved and separate determination\r\nof moisture avoided. When this is not practicable, the sample of some\r\nlbs. at least is ground in an ordinary bark-mill, well mixed, spread\r\nout flat on a floor or table, and several portions are taken as already\r\ndescribed, say 50-100 _grm._ in all, and dried in a water- or air-oven\r\nat 212° F. (100° C.). The moisture is best determined, to save time,\r\nin a small separate portion of 10 _grm._, which must be dried till\r\nit ceases to lose weight, and the loss taken as moisture. It must be\r\nweighed in a covered capsule, as it is very hygroscopic. When the\r\nlarger portion of the sample has been dried some hours, it is passed\r\ntwice through a good coffee-mill, and then returned to the oven till\r\nthoroughly dried, for which, 12-24 hours is generally sufficient.\r\nAnother method sometimes convenient is to take each acorn, or each\r\npiece of bark of the sample to be tested, and snip a piece from it with\r\na pair of tinners' shears, taking care that in the case of valonia the\r\nsection runs right to the centre of the cup; and in bark, that fair\r\nshares of the outer and inner layers are taken. The reason for drying\r\nbefore grinding is, that unless hard dried, tanning materials cannot be\r\npassed through a small mill. Bark and valonia usually contain 12-16 per\r\ncent. of moisture.\r\n\r\nExhaustion.--10 _grm._ of valonia, 20-30 _grm._ of bark, or\r\ncorresponding quantities of other material, are boiled briskly for\r\nhalf an hour with 1 _litre_ of distilled water, a funnel being placed\r\nin the neck of the flask, and great care being taken at first to avoid\r\nfrothing and boiling over. The flasks used should have a capacity of\r\nat least 1-1/2 _litre_. The whole contents are finally rinsed into\r\na gauged flask, allowed to cool to 59° F. (15° C.), and made up to\r\n1 _litre_. In the case of sumach, a little more boiling even than\r\nthis is desirable. This method has been found by the writer to give\r\nbetter results than boiling with successive portions of water. Another\r\nmethod is to boil for 1/2 hour with 250 _c.c._ of water, then pour the\r\nwhole on a filter, wash with boiling water so long as a drop of the\r\nfiltrate blackens paper moistened with a dilute solution of ferric\r\nacetate, and finally make up to 1 _litre_. Many materials, however,\r\nclog the filter to such an extent that washing is almost impossible.\r\nKathreiner has used 15 _litres_ of water, and corresponding quantities\r\nof material, in a large steam-jacketed copper pan, for each exhaustion,\r\nmaking the weight up finally to 15 _kilos._, with very uniform and\r\nexcellent results. (See also p. 130.) With all materials which deposit\r\nellagic acid or other insoluble derivatives, on cooling and standing,\r\nconsiderably higher results will be obtained if the titration be made\r\nas soon as the liquor is cold, than if it be allowed to stand 24 hours;\r\nin this respect, a uniform practice should be adhered to. Addition of\r\n1/2 _c.c._ of glacial acetic acid renders the infusions less liable to\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nAnalysis.--Of all the methods which have been proposed for the\r\nestimation of tannins, the only one which has met with any general\r\nacceptance is that of Löwenthal, and indeed it is the only one which in\r\nrapidity of execution and constancy of results is fitted for general\r\nuse. The method, as originally proposed, depends on the oxidation of\r\nthe astringent solution by permanganate in presence of indigo, which\r\nnot only serves as an indicator, but controls the oxidation, limiting\r\nit to those bodies which are more oxidisable than indigo. As, however,\r\nthese include gallic acid and other substances which are useless to\r\neither tanner or dyer, it is necessary to remove the tannin, and by\r\na second titration to obtain its value by difference. This Löwenthal\r\n(Zeitschrift f. Anal. Chemie, 1877, p. 33) accomplished by a solution\r\nof gelatin and common salt, to which, after mixture with the tannin\r\ninfusion, a small quantity of sulphuric or hydrochloric acid was added.\r\nIt was necessary to let this stand at least some hours before a clear\r\nfiltrate could be obtained, and the gelatin remaining in solution had\r\na slight though generally negligible effect on the permanganate. In\r\nsome cases, even after long standing, perfect filtration was extremely\r\ndifficult and tedious, and it was also clearly proved by Simand\r\n(Ding. Polyt. Jour., ccxliv. 400) that a certain proportion of the\r\ntanno-gelatin precipitate, varying with the acid present, and with\r\nthe species of tannin, remained in solution, and thus gave too low a\r\nresult. He therefore proposed to revert to the old method of separating\r\ntannin with hide raspings, or, as an improved substitute, with the\r\ngelatinous tissue of bones, and this is probably the most accurate\r\nmethod, but has the disadvantage of requiring considerable time for\r\nits execution. (See also p. 130.) The writer has therefore tried, and\r\nhe thinks successfully, so to modify Löwenthal's original method as to\r\nincrease its accuracy, and at the same time to make it more rapid and\r\neasy of execution. It was found that by saturating the clear filtrate\r\nwith salt, a further precipitate containing tannin was formed, but\r\nunfortunately, it was so finely divided that no amount of standing,\r\nor even of warming, and repeated passing through the paper, would\r\nobtain a clear filtrate. Finally, he hit on the device of mixing with\r\nthe liquid, before filtration, a portion of the pure kaolin used by\r\nphotographers. The effect was instantaneous and complete. A perfectly\r\nclear filtrate was obtained without any of the tedious waiting which\r\nbefore was necessary, and it was not only free from tannin, but also\r\nnearly so from gelatin, so that it only gave the faintest cloudiness\r\nwith tannin solution. Gelatin gives a more considerable precipitate,\r\nbut this is simply due to its insolubility in the saturated salt\r\nsolution, and it is redissolved on dilution with water.[L]\r\n\r\n[Footnote L: Hunt (Jour. Soc. Chem. Industry, April 1885) states, that\r\nsaturation with salt causes partial precipitation of gallic acid when\r\npresent, and that results agreeing more closely with those obtained by\r\nabsorption with hide are obtained by employing a mixture of 50 _c.c._\r\nliquor, 25 _c.c._ 2 per cent. gelatin solution, and 25 _c.c._ saturated\r\nsolution of salt containing 50 _c.c._ of concentrated sulphuric acid\r\nper _litre_ and a teaspoonful of kaolin. This approaches very nearly to\r\nLöwenthal's original method, but with the addition of the kaolin, and\r\nas in it, it is to be feared that a portion of the tannate of gelatin\r\nwill remain in solution. For accurate work, therefore, absorption by\r\nhide-raspings is preferable, though even that has been shown by the\r\nwriter to remove gallic acid and other matters beside tannin. Hunt\r\nstates that raw hide also absorbs catechin.]\r\n\r\nA slight error is introduced by the presence of a trace of oxidisable\r\nmatter in the gelatin, and when very great accuracy is required, it\r\nis well to make a blank estimation of \"not-tannin\" without tannin\r\ninfusion, and deduct 1/2 of the permanganate consumed as a correction\r\nfrom the not-tannin; but this may usually be disregarded. Each\r\ntitration should be made twice, and successive tests should not differ\r\nby more than 0·1 _c.c._ of permanganate.\r\n\r\nReagents.--Solutions are required of (1) Pure potash permanganate, 1\r\n_grm._ per _litre_. (2) Pure soda or potash sulphindigotate, 5 _grm._,\r\nand concentrated sulphuric acid, 50 _grm._ per _litre_. (3) Pure\r\noxalic acid, 6·3 _grm._ per _litre_ (decinormal). The sulphindigotate\r\n(indigo carmine), must be filtered, and when oxidised by permanganate,\r\nshould give a pure clear yellow, free from any trace of brown or\r\norange. Any contamination with indigo-purple, which gives brown\r\noxidation-products, is quite fatal to the accuracy of the analysis.\r\nThe permanganate solution is standardised by measuring 10 _c.c._ of\r\nthe (decinormal) oxalic acid solution, adding a little pure sulphuric\r\nacid and distilled water, warming to 136° F. (58° C.), and running in\r\nthe permanganate till a faint permanent pink is produced, for which\r\nabout 32-33 _c.c._ should be required. The indigo-carmine solution\r\nshould be of such strength that 14-16 _c.c._ of permanganate are\r\nrequired to bleach the quantity employed, which may be 20-25 _c.c._, as\r\nconvenient. (4) Gelatin solution: 2 _grm._ of Nelson's or other good\r\ngelatin are allowed to swell in distilled water for two hours, melted\r\nby setting the glass in a pan of boiling water, and made up to 100\r\n_c.c._ This will not keep. (5) Dilute sulphuric acid: 10 _c.c._ of pure\r\nconcentrated acid are added to 90 _c.c._ of distilled water. (6) Good\r\ntable salt. (7) Purified kaolin.\r\n\r\nThe analysis is performed in the following manner:--20 _c.c._ of indigo\r\nsolution, and 5 _c.c._ of the infusion of tanning material is added,\r\nin a white basin as recommended by Kathreiner, to about 3/4 _litre_\r\ngood water, which it is best to measure approximately, so that if it\r\ncontains any impurity which affects the permanganate it should be\r\nconstant, and thus be eliminated with the indigo. Permanganate solution\r\nis then allowed to drop in, with constant stirring till the pure yellow\r\nliquid shows a faint pinkish rim, most clearly seen on the shaded\r\nside. This end-reaction, which is of extraordinary delicacy, is due\r\nto Kathreiner, and is quite different to the pink caused by excess of\r\npermanganate, being an effect common to all pure yellow liquids. It is\r\nnot needful to make the titration so slowly as has been advised--the\r\npermanganate may be dropped in steadily with vigorous stirring, so\r\nlong as there is large excess of indigo, but as soon as the bottom\r\nof the basin can be seen through the solution, it must be added very\r\ncautiously, one or two drops at a time, and with occasional pauses, to\r\nallow time for its complete mixture through so large a mass of fluid.\r\nThe titration is repeated twice, and the results added together and\r\ndenoted by _a_. Then take 50 _c.c._ of the infusion, and add 28·6\r\n_c.c._ of the gelatin solution of Nelson's gelatin of 2 _grm._ to 100\r\n_c.c._ After shaking, the mixture is saturated with salt, which brings\r\nthe volume up to 90 _c.c._, and 10 _c.c._ of the dilute sulphuric acid\r\n(containing 1 vol. of concentrated acid in 10) and a teaspoonful of\r\npure kaolin are added. It is best to do this in a flask in which it\r\ncan be well shaken, after which, filtration may be at once proceeded\r\nwith, although it is safer to let it stand an hour or two: (the flask\r\nmay be cleansed with caustic soda solution). 10 _c.c._ of this filtrate\r\n(= 5 _c.c._ of the original infusion) are employed for a second pair\r\nof titrations, which are added as before, and the result denoted _b_.\r\nIf, further, _c_ be the quantity of permanganate required to oxidise\r\n10 _c.c._ of decinormal oxalic acid, and 10 _grm._ of the tanning\r\nmaterial have been employed to make 1 _litre_ of infusion, _c_ : (_a_ -\r\n_b_) :: 6·3 : _x_, where _x_ is the percentage of tannin expressed in\r\nterms of crystallised oxalic acid. If it be desired to calculate the\r\ngallic acid and non-tannin substances contained in the infusion, the\r\nvalue in permanganate of the indigo alone must be determined. Calling\r\nthis _d_, as _c_ is to (_b_ - _d_), so is 6·3 to the percentage of\r\nnon-tannins in terms of oxalic acid, and for the present it is best\r\ninvariably to calculate results in this way, since we do not actually\r\nknow the relation of any single tannin to permanganate, even Neubauer's\r\nnumber for gallotannic acid being probably too high, according to the\r\nrecent investigations of Councler and Schroeder,[M] and Oser's for\r\nquercitannic being at most only approximate. It happens, moreover, that\r\nthis last equivalent (62·36 _grm._ of quercitannic acid = 63 _grm._\r\nof crystallised oxalic acid) does not differ from that of oxalic acid\r\nmore than the ordinary limits of error of such estimation, and the\r\nsubstitution is therefore of no commercial importance, while it is\r\nsurely better to employ a standard which is easily and exactly verified\r\nthan one which is certain to be modified by further research, and so\r\nto run the risk either of having our results made useless for future\r\ncomparison, or of establishing a false or arbitrary equivalent. What\r\nis wanted for practical purposes is not the absolute weight of tannins\r\nin the various materials, but only a means for the relative comparison\r\nof two samples of the same material; cross comparisons of different\r\ntannins being simply delusive. If, however, it is necessary at any time\r\nto give actual percentages of gallotannic acid, it is probably best\r\nto stick to Neubauer's number for the present, as it is in general\r\nuse. Neubauer states that 63 _grm._ of oxalic acid consume as much\r\npermanganate as 41·37 _grm._ of gallotannic acid. Tshekawa found 41·688\r\nas the equivalent for tannin from Japanese gall nuts (Chem. News,\r\nxlii. 274). Councler and Schroeder on the other hand give only 34·3\r\n_grm._ Simand gives 61·1 _grm._ as the equivalent of quercitannic acid.\r\nCommercial \"pure tannin\" always gives results higher than the truth, as\r\nthe gallic acid which it contains consumes more permanganate than an\r\nequal weight of tannin, or even than the tannin which would yield it\r\nif boiled with acid. When this is done the equivalent used should be\r\ndefinitely stated, or it will certainly lead to confusion. Neubauer's\r\nequivalent is only properly applicable to gall nuts, and possibly to\r\nsumach and myrabolans. For oak bark Oser's number or that of oxalic\r\nacid is most likely nearly correct; and this may also be approximately\r\ntrue of oak wood and valonia, but as respects all other materials we\r\nhave no information whatever, and the oxalic equivalent is as likely to\r\nbe right as any other. (Compare note, p. 128.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote M: From researches by von Schroeder, published since the\r\nabove was penned, it seems that the permanganate consumed by tannin is\r\nlargely influenced by the way in which the titration is conducted, see\r\np. 128.]\r\n\r\nA few results are given below, not as showing the relative values of\r\nthe materials, which, of course, cannot be directly compared by any\r\nanalytical process, but for comparison with those obtained by other\r\nmethods and modes of calculation:--\r\n\r\n  ─────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┐\r\n                                   │                  │   Other Bodies   │\r\n                                   │       Tannin     │     Oxidised     │\r\n                                   │ (as Oxalic Acid).│ (as Oxalic Acid).│\r\n  ─────────────────────────────────┼──────────────────┼──────────────────│\r\n  Spent Liquor                     │     O·12         │    11·0          │\r\n  Valonia (good Smyrna).

On the other hand,\r\nthere is no doubt that the salt and acid of Löwenthal's method\r\nprecipitate of themselves a large proportion of certain tannins. In\r\nthe case of cutch this amounted, in the analysis given, to 67 per cent.\r\nof the whole. There is, however, good reason to believe that this would\r\nalso have been absorbed, or at least removed from solution by hide in\r\nthe process of tanning. This is shown by the analysis of the spent\r\nliquor above given, which originally contained the tannins of oak bark,\r\nvalonia, myrabolans, gambier, hemlock, and oak wood extracts, &c., to\r\nthe extent of 10 to 15 per cent., but which was reduced by contact\r\nwith hide to 0·12 per cent. That a portion had not been absorbed but\r\ndecomposed is proved by the large accumulation of oxidisable impurities\r\n(equal to 11 per cent. of oxalic acid); at the same time this example\r\nshows that the method is capable of estimating a very small portion of\r\ntannin in presence of much gallic acid and other analogous substances.\r\nIt is worth remark that such spent liquors become very pale in colour,\r\nand also that the filtrates, freed from tannin by precipitation, are\r\nnearly colourless, thus proving that the colouring matters present in\r\ntanning materials are of the nature of tannins, at least as regards\r\ntheir precipitability by hide and gelatin.\r\n\r\nSimand (Dingl. Polyt. Jour., ccxlvi. 133) has recommended instead of\r\nprecipitation with gelatin, the use of the gelatinous tissue of bones\r\nto remove the tannin. For this purpose porous bones, such as horn\r\npiths, are coarsely powdered, and after treatment with dilute soda\r\nsolution to remove the fat, are steeped in weak hydrochloric acid\r\ntill all the calcareous matter is dissolved. They are then thoroughly\r\nwashed, ground wet through a steel mill, washed again and dried at\r\na low temperature; the tannin is removed more quickly than by raw\r\nhide, and the amount of gelatinous matter dissolved by cold water is\r\na very trifling one. This method, or that with purified hide-powder,\r\nis to be recommended for scientific research, since no element capable\r\nof precipitating substances other than those absorbed by the hide\r\nis introduced, while it is not certain in all cases that saturation\r\nwith salt and acidification may not remove other constituents of the\r\nliquor besides tannins. It has, however, for technical purposes the\r\ngreat disadvantage of requiring a much longer time for absorption of\r\nthe tannin than is the case with gelatin solution, and of the process\r\nbeing much more difficult of execution. If hide-powder be employed, it\r\nmust be moistened with a small quantity of water before adding to the\r\ninfusion, and this water must be taken into account in the quantity\r\nof the filtrate employed for the titration of the \"non-tannin.\" The\r\ndigestion with the hide- or bone-powder must be continued till the\r\nfiltered liquid does not give the faintest clouding with a drop of\r\nclear gelatin solution, and it is always very difficult to be sure that\r\nthe tannin is so completely removed as with gelatin and salt. Hide-\r\nor bone-powder may be employed to determine the actual weight of any\r\nunknown tannin absorbable by hide, by evaporating equal quantities of\r\nthe original infusion and of that freed from tannin by digestion with\r\nthe powder; the difference giving the tannin absorbed. The evaporation\r\nmust be conducted as far as possible in absence of air, for instance\r\nin _vacuo_, or in a current of carbonic dioxide, and the residues both\r\ndried at 212° F. (100° C.) so long as they lose weight. The amount of\r\nmatter dissolved from an equal quantity of the hide- or bone-powder by\r\nwater must also be ascertained and taken into the calculation.\r\n\r\nAmmoniacal solution of cupric acetate or sulphate has been employed by\r\nseveral chemists to remove tannin from solutions. N. H. Darton of New\r\nYork, who has a large practice in tannin analysis, employs cuprammonic\r\nsulphate in the following manner.\r\n\r\nThe infusion, for which 20 _grm._ of hemlock bark or a corresponding\r\nquantity of other material must be used, is made by exhausting with\r\n2 or 3 quantities of water successively, first cold, and then with\r\nheat (by placing the flask in a pan of boiling water), each portion of\r\nwater being poured off into a _litre_ flask. The last should be almost\r\ncolourless. The liquor is thus made up to nearly 1 _litre_, 25 _c.c._\r\nof dilute sulphuric acid (about 1 vol. concentrated in 10) is added,\r\nand the liquor is filtered through a small filter, which is finally\r\nrinsed with a small quantity of water. Liquid ammonia is now added till\r\nthe liquor slightly smells of it, and, if any precipitate is formed, it\r\nis filtered off as before; 25 _c.c._ of dilute sulphuric acid is again\r\nadded (which should give the liquid an acid reaction), and it is made\r\nup to 1 _litre_. The titration is done as described under Löwenthal's\r\nmethod, but instead of precipitating with gelatin, 100 _c.c._ is mixed\r\nwith 100 _c.c._ of a solution of copper sulphate to which sufficient\r\nammonia has been added to redissolve the precipitate first formed, and\r\ncontaining 1-1/4 per cent. of copper sulphate. This is well shaken and\r\nfiltered, and the \"not-tannin\" is determined in the filtrate just as\r\nwith gelatin; a little dilute sulphuric acid being added in the basin\r\nto neutralise the ammonia. The writer has examined this method with\r\nregard to a few tanning materials. With valonia (and therefore probably\r\nwith oak bark) the preliminary treatment is unnecessary, and copper\r\nprecipitation gives results practically identical with the improved\r\ngelatin, while it is less troublesome. On the other hand, a sample of\r\nMiller's Hungarian Larch Extract which gave tannin equal to 18·08 per\r\ncent. (by the gelatin method) gave no precipitate with cuprammonic\r\nsulphate, and hence a result in tannin of _nil_ by Darton's method. It\r\nis worth remark that by the copper method it is therefore possible to\r\nestimate the valonia tannin alone in a mixture of larch and valonia\r\ntannin. Probably this mode of analysis may also be utilised to separate\r\nother tannins. With chestnut extract the results seem satisfactory, as\r\nregards the precipitation of the tannin by copper, the figures agreeing\r\nvery closely with those by gelatin, but the preliminary treatment with\r\nsulphuric acid and ammonia precipitates about 75 per cent. of what\r\nis usually reckoned as tannin, leaving 7·53 per cent. of tannin only\r\ninstead of 25·53 per cent. as reckoned by the gelatin method; which,\r\njudging by practical results in tanning, can hardly be accepted as\r\ncorrect. The results of the gelatin method are found to agree fairly\r\nwith those of direct absorption by hide-powder, which is strong\r\nconfirmation that what is estimated as tannin is what is absorbed\r\nby the hide. It is well known that sulphuric acid precipitates many\r\ntannins, and in an experiment with cutch it was found by the writer\r\nthat saturation with salt and the addition of dilute sulphuric acid as\r\nfor Löwenthal's process, but without the gelatin, precipitated 67 per\r\ncent. of the total tannin as usually reckoned.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that it is impossible by analysis to compare the relative\r\nvalue of different tannins, such as those of myrobalans and gambier,\r\nor hemlock and valonia. All that analysis can reasonably be expected\r\nto do is to give the relative values of different samples of the\r\nsame substance, or at the most, of materials of the same class. All\r\nother comparisons are misleading; and would be so, even if the exact\r\npercentage of each tannin could be calculated; since the commercial and\r\npractical value of different materials does not depend on the quantity\r\nof tannin only, but on the character of the leather it produces, hard\r\nor soft, dark- or light-coloured and heavy- or light-weighing.\r\n\r\nA Commission of German technical chemists, under the presidency of\r\nDr. Councler of Eberswalde, and including Messrs. Eberz, Kathreiner,\r\nSchaun, von Schroeder, and Simand, have recently reported on methods\r\nof tannin estimation ('Bericht über die Verhandlungen der Commission\r\nzur Feststellung einer einheitlichen Methode der Gerbstoffbestimmung,'\r\nCassel, 1885). After reviewing earlier methods, they recommend the\r\nfollowing modifications of the Löwenthal method, for general adoption.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemicals employed.\r\n\r\n(1) _Permanganate solution._ 10 _grm._ of the purest potash\r\npermanganate are dissolved in 6 _litres_ of distilled water.\r\n\r\n(2) _Indigo solution._ 30 _grm._ dry sulphindigotate of soda (Carminum\r\ncærul. opt., \"pure Indigotin I\" of Gehe & Co., Dresden), air-dry, are\r\ndissolved in 3 _litres_ of dilute sulphuric acid (1 vol. H_{2}SO_{4}\r\nto 3 vols, water), 3 _litres_ of distilled water are added, the whole\r\nis shaken till dissolved, and filtered. In each titration, 20 _c.c._\r\nare used in 3/4 _litre_ of water, and reduce about 10·7 _c.c._ of\r\npermanganate.\r\n\r\n(3) _Hide-powder_ must be white and in a fine woolly state of division,\r\nand should yield to cold water no substance capable of reducing\r\npermanganate. Such a powder is prepared by Dr. Both of Berlin,[N] and\r\nby the Vienna Research Station.\r\n\r\n[Footnote N: Messrs. Mawson and Swan, of Newcastle, have kindly\r\nundertaken to keep these, and the other reagents mentioned in this\r\nbook, in stock for the convenience of English tanners and chemists.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMode of Titration.\r\n\r\nInstead of adding the permanganate solution drop by drop, to the\r\nmixture of indigo, water, and liquor (as described, p. 121), it is\r\nrecommended to add it 1 _c.c._ at a time,[O] vigorously stirring 5-10\r\nseconds after each addition. When the liquid has become bright green,\r\n2-3 drops at a time are cautiously added with stirring, till the liquid\r\nis pure yellow. Either a beaker on a white tile or a white basin may be\r\nused (compare p. 121). It is advantageous in strong sunlight to shade\r\nthe window with white tissue-paper.\r\n\r\n[Footnote O: It has been noted by several chemists, and especially by\r\nKathreiner, and later by Prof. von Schroeder, that the quantity of\r\npermanganate reduced by a given amount of tannin varies within rather\r\nwide limits, according to the rate at which the permanganate is added;\r\nand the \"1 _c.c._ method\" was suggested by Prof. von Schroeder, to\r\nsecure uniformity in this particular. It has, however, been found by\r\nthe writer, in the course of experiments not yet completed, that the\r\nquantity of permanganate required, was a function not simply of time,\r\nbut of the rapidity of diffusion through so large a bulk of liquid;\r\nand by the alternate use of a simple glass rod, and of a specially\r\nconstructed perforated stirrer, he was able, while adhering strictly\r\nto Prof. von Schroeder's directions, to obtain results even more\r\ndivergent by the \"1 _c.c._ method\" than could be obtained by the drop\r\nmethod previously recommended, when properly carried out. Employed in\r\nconjunction with the use of tannin for standardising, as recommended by\r\nthe Commission, either method gives perfectly dependable results.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the variation is a simple one. The oxidation in\r\nthe Löwenthal process should be limited to indigo, and bodies more\r\noxidisable than indigo, but there exist both ready formed in liquor,\r\nand among these oxidation products many substances which in the absence\r\nof indigo will readily reduce permanganate. When the latter is added\r\nrapidly, and with insufficient stirring, it destroys the indigo and\r\ntannin in contact with it, and proceeds also to oxidise the other\r\nmatters present, although in other parts of the beaker indigo and\r\ntannin still exist. Thus more permanganate is reduced than corresponds\r\nto the indigo and tannin, and this is especially so towards the end\r\nof the process, when very little of either remains. The more slowly\r\nthe permanganate is added, and the more vigorously it is stirred, the\r\nmore closely it will approximate to the theoretical quantity required\r\nmerely to oxidise the indigo and tannin. It seems to the writer more\r\nscientific to approach this as nearly as possible, than to attempt to\r\nestablish a purely arbitrary standard such as the \"1 _c.c._ method;\"\r\nbut he would rather refrain from committing himself to a definite\r\nopinion till his experiments are complete.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PL. V.\r\n\r\n_E. & F. N. Spon, London & New York._\r\n\r\n\"INK-PHOTO.\" SPRAGUE & CO. LONDON.\r\n\r\nSOFTENING THE SKINS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nStandardisation of the permanganate.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the uncertainty involved in comparing tannin (which reduces\r\ndifferent quantities of permanganate according to the method of\r\ntitration) with so dissimilar a reducing agent as oxalic acid, it\r\nis recommended to employ tannin, titrated under precisely the same\r\nconditions as the tanning material, so that whatever method be\r\nemployed, the differences will be common to both, and will so be\r\neliminated. Prof. von Schroeder has shown (Report, p. 45) by careful\r\nexperiment, that with the purest samples of tannin the permanganate\r\nvalue estimated on the total dry substance of the tannin varied by\r\nvery little from that of the part of the tannin absorbed by hide as\r\ndetermined by Hammer's process, but on the average bore the proportion\r\nof 1 : 1·05. The percentage of water in an air-dried tannin must\r\nbe estimated by drying a portion at 201°-212° F. (94°-100° C.) and\r\ndetermining the loss, and a quantity equivalent to 2 _grm._ must be\r\ndissolved in 1 _litre_ of water and 10 _c.c._ titrated with indigo in\r\nthe usual way. If the permanganate value thus obtained be multiplied\r\nby 1·05, it will be equivalent to that of 2 _grm._ of chemically pure\r\ntannin. It is only necessary to determine the moisture occasionally, if\r\nthe tannin be kept in a well-closed box or bottle.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain if a tannin is pure enough for this, use a solution made\r\nas above described (it is not necessary to determine the moisture) and\r\n10 _c.c._ are titrated with permanganate in the usual way. 50 _c.c._\r\nare then digested in the cold with 3 _grm._ hide-powder (previously\r\nmoistened with distilled water and well squeezed in linen) for 18-20\r\nhours, with frequent shaking, filtered, and 10 _c.c._ again titrated.\r\nIf the second titration (\"not-tannin\") does not exceed 5 per cent.\r\nof the total, it is _good_, but it may be _used_ so long as the\r\n\"not-tannin\" does not exceed 10 per cent.[P] The purest tannin examined\r\nby Prof. von Schroeder was Schering's Phar. Ger., which may be obtained\r\nof Messrs. Mawson and Swan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote P: Gallic acid suggests itself to the writer as being a good\r\nstandard, since it behaves with permanganate like tannin, and being\r\ncrystalline is easily purified and of definite composition.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe course of analysis is as follows:--\r\n\r\n_Preparation of the infusions._--Extracts are dissolved in hot\r\nwater, and if necessary, filtered. Barks and other solid materials\r\nare treated in Prof. von Schroeder's extraction-apparatus (Fig. 20)\r\n(which seems very well adapted for its purpose). This consists of a\r\nperfectly cylindrical vessel of cast-tin, about 12·5 _c.m._ deep and\r\n7 _c.m._ diameter. A strainer covered with fine muslin fits it like a\r\npiston.[Q] The powdered material is placed in the cylinder, and stirred\r\nup with 200 _c.c._ of cold water. At the end of an hour, the piston is\r\ninserted and pressed down gently, the clear liquor is poured off, and\r\nthe process is 4 times repeated with hot water, at intervals of 1/2\r\nhour, placing the cylinder in a water-bath. The liquid is made up to 1\r\n_litre_, and, if necessary, filtered (Report, p. 66). The quantity of\r\nmaterial used should be such as to give an infusion of which 10 _c.c._\r\ndo not reduce more than 8 _c.c._ permanganate. If it is desired to\r\ndetermine separately the \"easily soluble tannin\" (viz. that extracted\r\nby cold water), Real's Press (Fig. 21) is employed, which consists of\r\na cylinder _a_, through which water may be forced by the pressure of a\r\ncolumn of liquid. The small sieve _d_, covered with a disc of linen,\r\nis placed in _a_, next the tanning material previously thoroughly\r\nmoistened with water, and the tap is closed. The press is then filled\r\nwith water and left 15 hours under a pressure of 1-1/2 _metres_. The\r\ntap is then opened and 1 _litre_ is allowed to run through in the\r\ncourse of about 2 hours, and mixed by shaking. The material is finally\r\nexhausted like a new material in von Schroeder's apparatus to extract\r\nthe difficultly soluble tannin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote Q: Both this apparatus, and the Real's press, may be obtained\r\nfrom C. Focke, Zinngiesser, Grosse Kirchgasse 3, Dresden.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\nThe titration is carried out as before described; in each infusion\r\nseparately to determine the \"not-tannin\" 50 _c.c._ are treated with 3\r\n_grm._ hide-powder, and 10 _c.c._ are titrated.\r\n\r\nIt may be well in conclusion for the writer to state for the\r\ninformation of the non-chemical reader, that though for purposes of\r\ncomparison of the results of different chemists, it is most desirable\r\nto have a standard method of the highest possible perfection; any of\r\nthe accepted modifications of the Löwenthal method will give excellent\r\npractical results in careful hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSOLE-LEATHER:--Preparing the Hides.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal sources of hides for sole-leather are:--\r\n\r\n(I.) Market hides, from the cattle slaughtered for food in the United\r\nKingdom. These are received by the tanner, fresh, or slightly salted,\r\nand are either bought directly from the butcher, or, now more commonly,\r\nthrough the auction markets established in all large towns. The latter\r\nsystem, while it perhaps slightly enhances the price of the hides to\r\nthe tanner, ensures him a better classification according to weight,\r\nand, in some cases, as notably in that of Glasgow, a better flaying,\r\nthrough an organised system of inspection and sorting. The Scotch\r\nhides, being mostly from Highland cattle, are many of them small and\r\nvery plump, for, as a rule, the hides are thickest on those animals\r\nwhich are exposed to cold and the hardships of out-door life. On the\r\nother hand, the hides of highly-bred cattle are apt to be thin and\r\nspreading; and, if they have been kept much indoors, and negligently\r\nmanaged, the grain of the hide is injured by the dung which adheres to\r\nit. The Irish hides are usually somewhat roughly flayed.\r\n\r\n(II.) South American hides are from the River Plate, Uruguay, and Rio\r\nGrande. Those from the River Plate are considered the best, as being\r\nstoutest and finest in texture. They are usually cured by salting,\r\nand are known as \"saladeros,\" \"estancias,\" and \"mataderos,\" according\r\nto the slaughter and cure. The saladeros are the best, and are from\r\ncattle killed at large slaughtering establishments on the coast. The\r\nestancias are from cattle killed in the interior, and are worse in\r\nflaying than the saladeros, but free from the objectionable dark cure\r\nof the mataderos, which are killed by the city butchers. Many hides\r\nare brought from Brazil, and are generally both salted and sun-dried,\r\nor simply stretched out and dried. Hides are also imported from\r\nValparaiso, both dry and wet-salted.\r\n\r\nChinese and West Indian hides are mostly dried. Chinese hides are\r\noccasionally infected with _Bacillus anthracis_, which produces the\r\ndangerous \"malignant-pustule,\" or \"wool-sorters' disease.\" Hence any\r\npimple appearing after working with such hides should have immediate\r\nmedical attention. French market hides have been of recent years\r\nlargely imported; they are mostly well flayed, and some of them\r\nvery heavy, but are sold at original butchers' weight, and, in the\r\nexperience of some tanners, the result in leather is 5-6 per cent. less\r\nthan from English market hides. They usually lose about 25 per cent.\r\nin skulling and salting. Lisbon hides are often well flayed, but are\r\nfrequently branded, and the grain is injured by insects. They yield\r\nconsiderably more leather than market hides in proportion to weight.\r\nHambro' hides are salted, but mostly wet and ill-flayed. Very heavy\r\nhides are produced in the Rhine district and in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nFor further information about hides, see the Commercial Section.\r\n\r\n_Preparation for Tanning._--Market hides should be well washed in\r\nfresh water, to remove blood and dirt, before unhairing; but prolonged\r\nsoaking dissolves a portion of hide-substance, and probably reduces\r\nweight, though it facilitates the action of the lime. It is very\r\nadvantageous if grease and flesh, and also dung can be removed before\r\nliming, and if hand-labour is too costly machinery might be employed.\r\nSalted hides should be soaked somewhat longer, and in clean water, so\r\nas to remove the salt before liming. This water should be frequently\r\nchanged, since 10 per cent. brine dissolves coriin freely (see p.\r\n19). Dried hides require more lengthened treatment. Before they are\r\nprepared for tanning, they must be brought back as far as possible\r\nto the condition of fresh hides, and, for this purpose, must be\r\nthoroughly soaked and softened in water. There are many ways of doing\r\nthis: sometimes hides are suspended in running water; sometimes laid in\r\nsoaks, which may be either renewed, or allowed to putrefy; sometimes in\r\nwater to which salt, borax, or carbolic acid has been added, to prevent\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nThe first of these methods, were it desirable, is rarely possible in\r\nthese days of River Pollution Acts; of the others, it is difficult to\r\nsay which is better, since the treatment desirable varies with the\r\nhardness of the hide and the temperature at which it has been dried.\r\nThe great object is to thoroughly soften the hide, without allowing\r\nputrefaction to injure it. As dried hides are often damaged already\r\nfrom this cause, either before drying, or from becoming moist and\r\nheated on ship-board, it is frequently no easy matter to accomplish\r\nthis. The fresh hide, as has been seen, contains considerable portions\r\nof albumen, and if the hide is dried at a high temperature, this\r\nbecomes wholly or partially coagulated and insoluble. The gelatinous\r\nfibre and the coriin (if indeed the latter exists ready formed in the\r\nfresh hide) do not coagulate by heat, but also become less readily\r\nsoluble. Gelatin dried at 266° F. (130° C.) can only be redissolved by\r\nacids, or water at 248° F. (120° C.). Eitner experimented with pieces\r\nof green calf-skin of equal thickness, which were dried at different\r\ntemperatures, with results given in the following table:--\r\n\r\n  ───────┬────────────┬───────────┬──────────┬────────────┬─────────────────┐\r\n         │Temperature │           │ Time of  │            │ Coriin Dissolved│\r\n  Sample.│  of Drying.│ Remarks.  │ Softening│ Remarks.   │   by Salt       │\r\n         │            │           │ in Water.│            │   Solution.     │\r\n  ───────┼────────────┼───────────┼──────────┼────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n     I.  │ 59° F.     │ In vacuo  │  24 hours│{Without   }│ 1·68 per cent.  │\r\n         │  (15° C.)  │           │          │{mechanical}│                 │\r\n    II.  │ 71-1/2° F. │  In sun   │   2 days │{ work     }│ 1·62    \"       │\r\n         │  (22° C.)  │           │          │            │                 │\r\n         │            │           │          │            │                 │\r\n   III.  │ 95° F.     │{In drying-│}   5  \"  │twice worked│ 0·15    \"       │\r\n         │  (35° C.)  │{closet    │}         │            │                 │\r\n         │            │           │          │            │                 │\r\n    IV.  │ 140° F.    │      \"    │ {Refused to soften   }│  Traces.        │\r\n         │  (60° C.)  │           │ { sufficiently for   }│                 │\r\n         │            │           │ { tanning            }│                 │\r\n  ───────┴────────────┴───────────┴──────────┴────────────┴─────────────────┘\r\n\r\nHence it is evident that, for hides dried at low temperatures, short\r\nsoaking in fresh and cold water is sufficient, and, except in warm\r\nweather, there would be little danger of putrefaction. With harder\r\ndrying, longer time is required, and it may be necessary to use brine\r\ninstead of water. A well-known tanner recommends a solution of 30°-35°\r\nbarkometer (sp. gr. 1·035, or about 5 per cent. of NaCl). This will\r\nhave a double action, not only preserving from putrefaction, but\r\ndissolving a portion of the hide-substance in the form of coriin.\r\nAlthough this is undoubtedly a loss to the tanner, it is questionable\r\nif there is any process which will soften overdried hides without loss\r\nof weight: since even prolonged soaking in cold water at too low a\r\ntemperature to allow of putrefaction will dissolve a serious amount\r\nof hide-substance. Water containing a small quantity of carbolic acid\r\nhas been recommended for the purpose, and will prevent putrefaction,\r\nwhile it has no solvent power on the hide, but, on the contrary,\r\nwill coagulate and render insoluble albuminous matters. Concentrated\r\ncarbolic acid, however, tans the grain and renders it incapable of\r\ncolouring in the liquors. Borax has been proposed for the same purpose,\r\nand, in strong solution, certainly prevents putrefaction, but is\r\nprobably too costly. Sodium sulphide and other sulphides seem to have\r\nconsiderable effect in softening dried hides, from their property of\r\nattacking hard albuminous matters, without injuring the true hide-fibre.\r\n\r\nFor some descriptions of hides, however, and notably for India kips,\r\nputrid soaks seem actually to be an advantage, the putrefactive action\r\nsoftening and rendering soluble the hardened tissue. In India the\r\nnative tanners soften their hides in very few hours by plunging them in\r\nputrid pools, into which every description of tannery refuse is allowed\r\nto run. Putrefactive processes are always dangerous, as the action,\r\nthrough changes of temperature, or variation in the previous state of\r\nthe liquor, is apt to be irregular, and either to attack one portion of\r\nthe hide before another, or to proceed faster than was expected. Hence\r\nhides in the soaks require constant and careful watching, and the goods\r\nmust be withdrawn as soon as they are thoroughly softened, for the\r\nputrefaction is constantly destroying as well as softening the hides.\r\nIt is possible that putrefactive softening is less injurious to kips,\r\nand such goods as are intended for upper-leather, than to those for\r\nsole purposes, as it is generally considered necessary in the former\r\ncase that the albumen and interfibrillary matter be removed, and that\r\nthe fibre be well divided into its constituent fibrils for the sake of\r\nsoftness and pliability; so that the putrid soak, if acting rightly,\r\nonly accomplishes a part of the work which would afterwards have to be\r\ndone by the lime and the bate. The actual fibre of the hide seems less\r\nreadily putrescible than the albuminoid parts; hence the putrefaction\r\nmay soften the latter better, and even at less expense of valuable\r\nhide-substance, because more rapidly, than fresh water. On this point,\r\nthere is room for investigation. Putrefaction is a general name for a\r\nclass of decompositions which are caused by a great variety of living\r\norganisms, each of which has its own special products and modes of\r\naction. It is quite possible that, if we knew what precise form of\r\nputrefaction was most advantageous, we might by appropriate conditions\r\nbe able to encourage it to the exclusion of others, and obtain better\r\nresults than at present. It will be necessary to revert to this subject\r\nwhen speaking of the bates used in preparing dressing-leather, which\r\nalso owe their activity to putrid fermentation.\r\n\r\nBeside merely soaking the hides, it is necessary to work them\r\nmechanically, to promote their softening, which was formerly\r\naccomplished by \"breaking over\" the hides on the beam with a blunt\r\nknife. This process is now usually superseded or supplemented by the\r\nuse of the \"stocks\"; these consist of a wooden or metallic box, of\r\npeculiar shape, wherein work 2 very heavy hammers, raised alternately\r\nby pins in a wheel, and let fall upon the hides, which they force\r\nup against the side of the box with a sort of kneading action. The\r\nordinary form of this machine is shown in Fig. 22. A more modern form,\r\nwhich seems to possess some advantages, is the American double-shover,\r\nseen in Fig. 23.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe number of hides which can be stocked at once naturally varies with\r\nthe size of both hides and stocks, but should be such that the hides\r\nwork regularly and steadily over and over. The whole number should not\r\nbe put in at once, but should be added one after another, as they get\r\ninto regular work. The duration of stocking is 10-30 min., according\r\nto the condition and character of the hides. Hides should not be\r\nstocked till they are so far softened that they can be doubled sharply,\r\nwithout breaking or straining the fibre. After stocking, they must be\r\nsoaked again for a short time, and then be brought into an old lime. A\r\nsmall quantity of sodium sulphide added to the soaks or in the stocks\r\nhas been recommended as of great value in softening obstinate hides,\r\nand probably with justice, from its well-known softening action upon\r\ncellular and horny tissues.\r\n\r\nIn Continental yards, another machine is in use for softening hides,\r\nand which seems to present some advantages over stocks, as being less\r\nsevere on the thinner portions of the hide. It consists of a pair\r\nof rollers, arranged like those of a wringing machine, and pressed\r\ntogether by springs, but not allowed to come into actual contact. One\r\nof them is studded with rounded pegs, which correspond in position to\r\ngrooves round the other, and the hide when passed between them is thus\r\nsubjected to a very thorough kneading and stretching. Tumbler drums of\r\nvarious forms may also be used with good effect for softening purposes,\r\nespecially for skins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nSOLE-LEATHER:--Unhairing Hides.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn England, lime is the agent almost universally employed for\r\nloosening the hair, though every tanner admits its deficiencies and\r\ndisadvantages. It is hard, however, to recommend a substitute which is\r\nfree from the same or greater evils, and lime has one or two valuable\r\nqualities which will make it very difficult to supersede. One of these\r\nis that, though it inevitably causes loss of substance and weight,\r\nit is also impossible, with any reasonable care, totally to destroy\r\na pack of hides by its use; which is by no means the case with some\r\nof its rivals. Another advantage is that, owing to its very limited\r\nsolubility in water, it is a matter of comparatively small consequence\r\nwhether much or little is used; and even if the hides are left in a\r\nfew days longer than necessary, the mischief, though certain, is only\r\nto be detected by careful and accurate observation. With all other\r\nmethods, exact time and quantity are of primary importance, and it is\r\nnot easy to get ordinary workmen to pay the necessary attention to\r\nsuch details. Again, the qualities of lime, its virtues and failings,\r\nhave been matter of experience for hundreds of years, and so far as\r\nsuch experience can teach, we know exactly how to deal with it. A new\r\nmethod, on the other hand, brings new and unlooked-for difficulties,\r\nand often requires changes in other parts of the process, as well as\r\nin the mere unhairing, to make it successful. As our knowledge of the\r\nchemical and physical changes involved becomes greater, we may look\r\nto overcoming these obstacles more readily; for the power of dealing\r\nsuccessfully with new difficulties constitutes one of the main\r\nadvantages of a really scientific knowledge over an empirical one.\r\n\r\nSlaked lime is soluble in water at 60° F. (15° C.), to the extent of\r\n1 part in 778. Unlike most substances, it decreases in solubility at\r\nhigher temperatures, requiring 972 parts of water at 130° F. (54° C.),\r\nand 1270 parts at 212° F. (100° C.). Its action upon animal tissues\r\nincreases rapidly, however, with temperature, though no doubt it is\r\nmoderated to some extent by the lessened solubility. Calculating\r\nfrom Dalton's numbers, pure lime-water at 60° F. (15° C.) contains\r\n1·285 _grm._[R] of CaO per _litre_, and should require 459 _c.c._\r\nof decinormal acid to neutralise it. This estimate in some cases\r\nappears to be slightly too high; e. g. a saturated lime-water from\r\nCarboniferous limestone at 56.5° F. (13° C.) required only 433 _c.c._\r\nof decinormal acid, which equals 1·211 _grm._ of CaO per _litre_, and\r\nthis lime-water, kept with excess of lime, gave nearly constant results\r\nfor many months together. A magnesian limestone lime-water tested at\r\nthe same time required 472 _c.c._ of decinormal acid, confirming the\r\nold observation of tanners, that such lime is stronger than that made\r\neither from chalk or carboniferous limestone. This increased strength\r\nmust arise from the presence of some soluble base other than lime, and\r\nmay be due to the magnesia, which, however, is very slightly soluble.\r\nMagnesian limestone contains a very large amount of magnesia, and\r\nhence would not go so far as a purer limestone; but as a very large\r\nproportion of the lime ordinarily used is thrown away undissolved, this\r\nis perhaps of little practical moment. (For the chemical examination of\r\nlimes, see p. 102).\r\n\r\n[Footnote R: 1 _grm._ per _litre_ is very approximately equal to 1 oz.\r\nper cub. ft.]\r\n\r\nThe action of lime on the hide has already been spoken of to some\r\nextent. It is throughout a solvent one. The hardened cells of the\r\nepidermis swell up and soften, the _rete malpighi_ and the hair-sheaths\r\nare loosened and dissolved, so that, on scraping with a blunt knife,\r\nboth come away more or less completely with the hair (constituting\r\n\"scud,\" as some English tanners name it, Ger. _gneist_ or _grund_).\r\nThe hair itself is very slightly altered, except at its soft and\r\ngrowing root-bulb, but the true skin is vigorously acted on. The fibres\r\nswell and absorb water, so that the hides become plump and swollen,\r\nand, at the same time, the \"cement-substance\" (coriin) is dissolved,\r\nthe fibres become differentiated into finer fibrils, and the fibrils\r\nthemselves become first swollen and transparent, and finally corroded,\r\nand even dissolved. This swelling of the fibres is produced both by\r\nalkalies and acids, and is probably due to weak combinations formed\r\nwith the fibre-substance, which have greater affinities for water than\r\nthe unaltered hide. It is useful to the tanner, since it renders the\r\nhide easier to \"flesh\" (i. e. to free from the adhering flesh), on\r\naccount of the greater firmness which it gives to the true skin. It\r\nalso assists the tanning, by opening up the fibre, and so exposing a\r\ngreater surface. This is advantageous in dressing leather which is\r\nafterwards tanned in sweet liquors, and must have the cement-substance\r\ndissolved and removed for the sake of flexibility; and, in the case of\r\nsole-leather, it is necessary for the sake of weight and firmness that\r\nthe hide be plumped; but it is probable that the effect is produced\r\nwith less loss of substance and solidity by suitable acidity of the\r\nliquors. A more certain advantage of lime is that it acts on the fat of\r\nthe hide, converting it more or less completely into an insoluble soap,\r\nand so hindering its injurious effects on the after tanning process,\r\nand on the finished leather. If strong acids are used later on, this\r\nlime soap is decomposed, and the grease is again set free. In sweated\r\nor very low-limed hides this grease is a formidable evil.\r\n\r\nThe customary method of liming is simply to lay the hides flat in milk\r\nof lime in large pits. Every day, or even twice a day, the hides are\r\ndrawn out (\"hauled\"), and the pit is well plunged up, to distribute\r\nthe undissolved lime through the liquor. The hides are then drawn in\r\nagain (\"set\"), care being taken that they are fully spread out. How\r\nmuch lime is required is doubtful, but owing to its limited solubility,\r\nan excess, if well slaked, is rather wasteful than injurious. Great\r\ndifferences exist in the quantity of the lime used, the time given,\r\nand the method of working. Lime, as we have seen (p. 140), is only\r\nsoluble to the extent of about 1·25 _grm._ per _litre_, or (as 1 cub.\r\nft. of water weighs about 1000 oz.) say 1-1/4 oz. per cub. ft., or,\r\nin an ordinary lime-pit, not more than 1/4 lb. per hide. Only the\r\nlime in solution acts on the hide, but it is necessary to provide\r\na surplus of solid lime which dissolves as that in the liquor is\r\nconsumed. Jackson Schultz prescribes 1 bush. (56 lb.) of fresh lime to\r\n60-70 hides, and 3-4 days as sufficient time to unhair and plump them;\r\nwhile a well-known English tanner states that, after working for 6-10\r\ndays through a series of old limes, the hides (presumably wet-salted\r\nSouth Americans) should have 4 days in a fresh lime, made with 3-12\r\nlb. of lime per hide. It is obvious that if the American authority\r\nis right, the English process is wasteful in the extreme, both in\r\nhide-substance and lime. Much depends on the amount of hauling which\r\nthe hides receive, and the more frequently they are moved the better.\r\nIt is probable, however, that it would be found impossible to unhair\r\nand flesh hides, to suit the English market, in cold limes with the\r\nquantity and time mentioned, and if the limes are steamed, it is quite\r\nlikely that the destructive action on the pelt may be even greater than\r\nby the longer and slower process in the cold. Most likely a compromise\r\nbetween the two is the most desirable, but about 2-4 lb. of lime per\r\nhide, according to weight, should be amply sufficient; while a week\r\nfor market hides, and 14 days for heavy salted, will loosen the hair\r\nand plump the pelt as much as is requisite. This is on the supposition\r\nthat the limes are kept at a uniform average temperature of about\r\n60° F. (15° C.) in winter and summer. If they are heated to 80°-90°\r\nF. (27°-32° C.), of course much less time is required; but there are\r\nno published experiments showing the relative weights made by the\r\ntwo processes, and, from the fact that warmed limes are principally\r\nused for descriptions of leather where weight and solidity are not of\r\nprimary importance, it may be concluded that, in this direction, the\r\nresults are unsatisfactory. Hides do not plump in warm limes.\r\n\r\nAnother undecided point is whether the best results are obtained by\r\nmaking fresh limes for every pack, or by strengthening up the old ones.\r\nAn old lime becomes charged with decomposing animal matter and with\r\nammonia, and, within limits, loosens the hair more effectually than a\r\nnew one. An experienced tanner states that, by using old limes, better\r\nweights are obtained, but that the leather is thinner than when a fresh\r\nportion of lime is used; and this is quite possible. If, however, the\r\nold lime-liquor be retained too long, it ceases to swell the hides as\r\nit should, and, in warm weather, the liming proper is complicated by a\r\nputrefactive process allied in principle to sweating.\r\n\r\nBeside considerable quantities of ammonia, old limes contain tyrosin,\r\nleucin or amidocaproic acid, and some caproic acid, the disagreeable\r\ngoaty odour of which is very obvious on acidifying an old lime-liquor\r\nwith sulphuric acid, by which considerable quantities of a partially\r\naltered gelatin are at the same time precipitated. Very old limes,\r\nespecially in hot weather, often contain active bacteria, which may be\r\nseen in the microscope under a good 1/4-in. objective. Their presence\r\nis always an indication that putrefaction is going forward, and leather\r\nout of such limes will generally prove loose and hollow-grained.\r\nSpherical concretions of calcium carbonate may also be seen under\r\nthe microscope, resembling on a smaller scale those found in Permian\r\nlimestone, and caused perhaps in both cases by crystallisation from\r\na liquid containing much organic matter. It is probable that in many\r\ntanneries the ammonia would pay for recovery from the lime-liquors,\r\nwhich would be easily done by steaming the old limes in suitable\r\nvessels, and condensing the ammoniacal vapours in dilute sulphuric\r\nacid. (Some appliances suitable for this purpose are described in\r\nthe Journal of the Soc. of Chem. Industry, iii. 630.) For methods of\r\nestimation of ammonia, see p. 103.\r\n\r\nSeveral variations in the above-described method of liming have been\r\nproposed. The hides may be suspended on laths, or by strings attached\r\nto pegs or notches, and the liquor agitated by plunging in place of\r\nhauling. Probably this is an actual improvement, especially if some\r\nmechanical agitating contrivance be substituted for hand plunging. It\r\nhas, however, the drawback that much room is required, though this may\r\nbe, to some extent, compensated by the hides liming more quickly. The\r\nmethod has been long in use in America, and had been tried in several\r\nplaces in England before the patent of Messrs. Conyers and Pullein was\r\nobtained. Two other American labour-saving methods in connection with\r\nliming may be mentioned here. One is to have the liming-vat double\r\nthe ordinary size, and, instead of hauling the hides, to simply draw\r\nthem from one side to the other by two strings, which are attached to\r\nthe fore and hind shank of each hide, either by sharp iron hooks or\r\nby loops. The strings are looped over iron rods at the four corners\r\nof the pit, or have simple knots, which are placed in notches sawn in\r\nwood. Of course, while the hides are at one side of the pit, the other\r\nside may be plunged or warmed. The other method (Fig. 24) is to have\r\na spindle sunk below the surface of the liquor, and with discs A, at\r\neach end, to which the hides or sides are attached by hooks set round\r\nthe edges. The hides are turned over by revolving the spindle with a\r\nhandspike inserted in the holes C, at the ends of the cross-arms B, and\r\nthe whole spindle is also capable of being raised and lowered in the\r\nliquor, in the slot D. In Germany, hides are frequently suspended on\r\nlaths radiating from a central upright revolving spindle in a round vat\r\n(_Drehkalk_).\r\n\r\nAn American plan, sometimes known as the \"Buffalo method,\" is described\r\nby Jackson Schultz. The hide is prepared in the usual way, and is then\r\nthrown into a strong lime for 8-10 hours, when it is taken out and\r\nimmersed in water heated up to 110° F. (43° C.), in which it remains\r\n24-48 hours. The warm water soaks, softens, and swells the roots of\r\nthe hair, and much the same result is obtained as in \"scalding\" pigs.\r\nSo little lime really permeates the inner fibre that, after a slight\r\nwheeling, the hides may be thrown into cold water, and allowed to cool\r\nand plump, preparatory to taking their places in the handlers. The\r\nprocess is strongly recommended for sole-leather, particularly where\r\ngreat firmness of fibre is desired. The tanner who tries it must be\r\nsatisfied if he gets 20-30 sides a man unhaired and fully ready for the\r\nliquor per diem. Of course this process may be varied to any extent by\r\ngiving more liming, and less hot water, and this is frequently done in\r\nAmerica. About 3-4 days' cold liming in good limes, and with hauling\r\nif possible twice daily, followed by 12-24 hours in water at 86°-95°\r\nF. (30°-35° C.), which should be changed at least once, will give good\r\nresults. The hides are of course less plump than usual, but if properly\r\nmanaged in the handlers will swell well in the tan-house. Grease is\r\nobviously less thoroughly \"killed\" than in the ordinary method, and\r\nespecial care must be used that the hides are well worked on the beam,\r\nboth on grain and flesh. In this method, and indeed in all liming\r\nprocesses, much is gained if the fat can be fleshed off green.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\nOn the Continent and in America, the prevalent mode of loosening the\r\nhair, at least for sole-leather purposes, is called \"sweating,\" and\r\nconsists in inducing an incipient putrefaction, which attacks the soft\r\nparts of the epidermis and root-sheaths, before materially injuring\r\nthe hide-substance proper. The old European method of \"warm-sweating\"\r\nconsisted simply in laying the hides in pile, and, if necessary, in\r\nsupplying heat by covering them with fermenting tan; but as this crude\r\nand dangerous process is everywhere being supplanted by the American\r\nplan, where sweating at all is adhered to, it is not necessary to\r\ndo more than describe the latter. This is called \"cold sweating,\"\r\nbut really consists in hanging the hides in a moist chamber, kept at\r\na uniform temperature of 60°-70° F. (15°-21° C.); or in some cases\r\nslightly warmer.\r\n\r\nThe \"sweating-pit\" now in use is sometimes of wood, but usually\r\nconsists of a building of brick or stone, protected from changes of\r\ntemperature, both above, and at the sides, by thick banks of soil or\r\nspent tan. If soil be used, it will form an excellent bed for vines,\r\n&c., which are fertilised by the ammonia penetrating from below,\r\nwhich is evolved in large quantities and which assists the unhairing\r\nprocess by its action on the epidermis.[S] Though called a \"pit,\"\r\nit is undesirable that it should be actually below the level of the\r\nground, but should be arranged so that the hides can be wheeled in\r\nand out in barrows. It is lighted and ventilated by a lantern roof\r\nabove a central passage, and should be divided into chambers, each\r\ncapable of suspending a pack of hides. By means of sprinklers above and\r\nsteam-pipes below, the chambers may be cooled or warmed, as required,\r\nand the air kept so moist that globules of condensed water collect on\r\nall parts of the hides, which are suspended from tenterhooks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote S: Hides have been unhaired by the action of gaseous ammonia\r\nalone, but the method does not seem suited for technical use.]\r\n\r\nThe process is principally used in America for dried hides, but may\r\nbe employed either for wet or dry salted, after complete removal of\r\nthe salt. It is imperatively necessary that dried hides should be\r\ncompletely softened before sweating. As the sweating process advances\r\nmore rapidly in the upper than in the lower part of the pit, and as\r\nthe thick portions are more resistant than the thin ones, the hides,\r\nafter about 3 days' sweating, require constant attention in changing\r\ntheir positions, and in checking the forward ones by taking down and\r\nlaying in piles on the bottom of the pit.\r\n\r\nThe usual treatment for sweated hides, when the hair is sufficiently\r\nloosened, is to throw them into the stocks, and work out in this way\r\nthe slime and most of the hair. This has the disadvantage of working\r\nout too much of the dissolved gelatin, and of fulling the hair so\r\nfirmly into the flesh, that it is difficult again to remove it. To\r\novercome these evils, some American tanners now pass the hides, after\r\nsweating, through a weak lime. This, to a great extent, prevents\r\nthe hair fixing itself in the flesh, and tends to counteract the\r\ninjurious effect of the vitriol (which is almost invariably used in\r\nplumping sweat stock) on the colour of the leather. By this process,\r\n10,000 Texas and New Orleans wet-salted hides gave an average yield\r\nof leather of 73 per cent. on their green weight, and the leather was\r\nexcellent in quality (Schultz). If sweated or very lightly limed hides\r\nare imperfectly worked on the grain, greasy spots are apt to remain,\r\nwhich will not colour in the liquors (\"white spots\"). These may be made\r\nto colour by scraping and working the grain with a knife, or by the\r\napplication of a solution of soda or soda ash, and would probably be\r\navoided by the use of soda ash in the soaks on greasy parcels of hides.\r\n\r\nIt must be clearly understood that all sweating depends on partial\r\nputrefaction. This is proved both by the plentiful production of\r\nammonia in the pits, and by the fact that antiseptics, such as salt\r\nor carbolic acid, entirely prevent sweating till they are removed.\r\nAlthough the process undoubtedly has advantages, and especially so in\r\nthe treatment of dried hides, it is an open question whether it gives\r\nthe extreme gains over liming in weight and firmness, which are claimed\r\nby some of its advocates.\r\n\r\nAn unhairing process, largely coming into use on the Continent, depends\r\non the action of alkaline sulphides, and particularly sodium sulphide,\r\nupon the hair. While all the methods already spoken of involve the\r\nsoftening and destruction of the hair-sheaths, either by lime or\r\nby putrefaction, the sulphides are peculiar in attacking the hair\r\nitself; when strong, they disintegrate it rapidly and completely into\r\na sort of paste. From very early times to the present day, arsenic\r\nsulphide (\"rusma\") mixed with lime has been used in unhairing skins for\r\nglove-leather and similar purposes. About 1840, Böttger concluded that\r\nthe efficacy of arsenic sulphide was due simply to the sulphydrate of\r\nlime formed by combination of the sulphur with the lime, and proposed\r\nlime sulphydrate, formed by passing sulphuretted hydrogen into milk of\r\nlime, as a substitute for the poisonous and expensive arsenic compound.\r\nIt proved a most effective depilatory, but has never obtained much hold\r\nin practice. This is probably due to the fact that it will not keep,\r\noxidising rapidly on exposure to the air; hence it must be prepared\r\nas it is required, which is both troublesome and expensive. A minor\r\nobjection is the unpleasant smell of sulphuretted hydrogen, which is\r\ninseparable from its use.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed to replace it by sodium sulphide, which, though at\r\nfirst said to be only effective when mixed with lime, so as to produce\r\ncalcic sulphide, has since proved a powerful depilatory alone. Its use\r\nhas been greatly extended on the one hand by its production on a large\r\nscale, and in the crystallised form (at first by reduction of sulphate\r\nby heating with small coal), and on the other, by the great interest\r\nwhich Wilhelm Eitner, the able director of the Austrian Imperial\r\nResearch Station for the Leather Trades, has taken in its introduction.\r\nThe substance, as manufactured by De Haen, of List, Hanover, is in\r\nsmall crystals, coloured deep greenish-black, by iron sulphide, which\r\nmust have been held in suspension at the time of crystallisation.\r\nIf the salt be dissolved in water, and the solution be allowed to\r\nstand, this is gradually deposited as a black sediment, leaving the\r\nsupernatant liquor perfectly clear and colourless. Sodium sulphide is\r\nnow manufactured from tank waste in a much purer form by Schaffner\r\nand Helbig's process, of which Messrs. Gamble of St. Helens are sole\r\nlicencees. The crystallised salt is SNa_{2}10Aq, and therefore contains\r\n69·8 per cent. of water.\r\n\r\nFor sole-leather, the method recommended by Eitner is to dissolve 4-5\r\nlb. of sulphide per gal. of water, making the solution into a thin\r\npaste (of soupy consistence) with lime or pipe-clay. This is spread\r\nliberally on the hair side of the hides, one man pouring it down the\r\nmiddle of the hide from a pail, while another, with a mop or cane\r\nbroom, rubs it into every part. The hide is then folded into a cushion,\r\nand in 15-20 hours will be ready for unhairing, the hair being reduced\r\nto a paste. In the writer's experience, the concentrated solution here\r\nprescribed will completely destroy all hair wetted with it in 2-3\r\nhours, and if left on longer, will produce bluish patches, and render\r\nthe grain very tender. The hides should be thrown into water before\r\nunhairing, to enable them to plump, and to wash off the sulphide,\r\nwhich is very caustic, attacking the skin and nails of the workmen.\r\nThere is no doubt that this process gives good weight, and tough and\r\nsolid leather; but there are several difficulties attending its use.\r\nUnless the mopping is done with great care, it will fail to completely\r\ndestroy the hair, and the patches of short hair left are very difficult\r\nto remove. The expense of the material and the loss of hair are also\r\nimportant considerations. The hides are rather difficult to flesh,\r\nunless previously plumped by a light liming, and it is necessary to\r\nswell them with acid or sour liquor in the tanhouse, as the sulphide\r\nhas but little plumping effect.\r\n\r\nAnother method, which is much cheaper in labour and easier in\r\nexecution, is to suspend in a solution of sodium sulphide, containing\r\n3/4 lb. a hide or upwards; the hide should unhair in 24 hours. Very\r\nweak solutions loosen the hair, without destroying it; but it is\r\nalways weakened, as the specific action of the sulphides is on the\r\nhair itself. After or before unhairing, the hides may receive a\r\nlight liming, to plump them, or lime may be added to the solution of\r\nsulphide, which by forming calcium sulphide, and liberating caustic\r\nsoda, considerably increases the unhairing and plumping effect. The\r\npit may be several times strengthened for successive packs, but\r\nthe loosened hair must be fished out, or it will quickly spoil the\r\nsolution. When hides have been suspended in sodium sulphide solution,\r\nthe hair is very quickly loosened by a short liming. Squire, Claus,\r\nand J. Palmer have all taken out patents for the use of tank-waste\r\nas a depilatory. It consists of impure calcium sulphides, and when\r\nbrought into the form of soluble sulphydrate, either by boiling in\r\nwater, or by the oxidising action of the air, it will unhair hides. The\r\nconversion is, however, very imperfect in either case, and its action\r\nis uncertain and slow; while the iron present is apt to cause unsightly\r\nstains. It is probable that the weights obtained may somewhat exceed\r\nthose by liming. Palmer employs sulphuric acid to plump the hide and\r\nremove stains, and then reduces it by a bate of whiting and water. He\r\nclaims that this prepares the hide for rapid and heavy tanning, but\r\nthe swelling and subsequent reduction almost certainly entail loss of\r\nweight and quality, and to get good results the bate should at most\r\nonly be allowed to have a superficial effect. Professor Lufkin proposed\r\nthe use of a mixture of various sulphides of lime and soda, formed by\r\nmixing 10 lb. each of soda ash and sulphur, kneading to a paste with a\r\nlittle moist slaked and then mixing _warm_ in a cask with 80 lb. stone\r\nlime slaked to a paste. This quantity will unhair 50 hides in the same\r\nway and in about the same time as an ordinary lime. The pelt is not\r\nmuch plumped and is easily reduced by a few minutes' wheeling in warm\r\nwater. (J. S. Schultz.)\r\n\r\nVarious other depilatories have been proposed, but as they have not\r\ncome into general use, brief mention of the most important will\r\nsuffice. Anderson, in 1871, patented the use of wood-charcoal, applied\r\nin a similar manner to lime in the ordinary process. The hair is\r\nprobably loosened simply by putrefaction, as in sweating, while the\r\ncharcoal acts as a deodoriser, very little smell being produced, and\r\nthe action proceeding with considerable uniformity. John Palmer has\r\npatented a process for unhairing, in which the hides are alternately\r\nsteeped in water and exposed to the air till the hair loosens. In this,\r\nvery similar principles to those of the charcoal method are involved.\r\nCaustic potash and soda will loosen hair, but seem to have no decided\r\nadvantage over lime, though it is quite possible that in skilful\r\nhands good results might be obtained. They are more costly, and their\r\ncorroding action on the hide-substance is more powerful, but they form\r\nsoluble soaps with the grease of the hide. Unless used in very dilute\r\nsolution, the pelt is so swollen as to fix the hair, and the leather is\r\ndark-coloured and spongy. Soda-ash or crystals (sodic carbonate) may be\r\nused to strengthen ordinary limes, in which caustic soda is formed. The\r\ntime of liming is shortened, the hides are more swollen, and the grease\r\nis better \"killed\" than when lime alone is used. The patent for Moret's\r\n\"Inoffensive\" claimed the use of the carbonate or caustic potash formed\r\nfrom calcined wool-washings, for unhairing. This is more costly than,\r\nand has no advantage over soda. I am not aware whether \"Inoffensive,\"\r\nas now sold, has other constituents.\r\n\r\nWhatever method of loosening the hair may be adopted, the next step\r\nis to remove it by mechanical means. This is usually accomplished by\r\nthrowing the hide over a sloping beam, and scraping it with a blunt\r\ntwo-handled knife (Fig. 25), the workman pushing the hair downwards\r\nand away from him. The beam is now usually made of metal. The knife\r\nemployed is also shown at C, Fig. 26.\r\n\r\nWhen a hide is lightly limed, it is often easy to remove the long\r\nhair, but excessively difficult to get rid of the short under-coat\r\nof young hairs, which are found in spring, and which can sometimes\r\nonly be removed by the dangerous expedient of shaving with a sharp\r\nknife. The reason of this difficulty is obvious: not only do the short\r\nhairs offer very little hold to the unhairing knife, but, as has been\r\nexplained in describing the anatomical structure of the skin, their\r\nroots are actually deeper seated than those of the old hairs they\r\nreplace. Several attempts have been made to unhair by machinery, but\r\nso far without such success as to lead to their general adoption. The\r\nfleshing-machine invented by Garric and Terson, and manufactured in\r\nthis country by T. Haley and Co., of Bramley (Fig. 27), is furnished\r\nwith a special wheel for unhairing. An American machine for the\r\npurpose, invented by J. W. Macdonald, and said to be capable of\r\nunhairing 800 sides a day, is shown in Fig. 28.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.]\r\n\r\nWhen the hair is very thoroughly loosened, as by sweating, or\r\ndestroyed, as by sodium sulphide, it is not uncommon to work it off by\r\nfriction in the stocks; but it is very doubtful whether the saving of\r\nlabour is not more than compensated by the loss of weight, consequent\r\nupon submitting the hide while its gelatin is in a partially dissolved\r\ncondition, to such rough usage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29.]\r\n\r\nAfter unhairing, the loose flesh and fat are removed from the inner\r\nside of the hide by a sharp-edged knife E (Fig. 26), partly by brushing\r\nor scraping, partly by paring. It is necessary not only to cut off the\r\nvisible adhering fat, but to work the hide well, so as to force out\r\nthat contained in the loose areolar tissue, which would not only impede\r\ntanning, but is liable to soak completely through the hide, producing\r\nmost unsightly blotches. Several machines have been introduced to\r\nsupersede hand-fleshing, but with only partial success. One of the\r\nbest is Garric and Terson's machine (Fig. 27), which gives a very\r\nlevel flesh, free from galls, and without so much loss of weight, but\r\nscarcely so clean as desirable, while the saving in labour is not\r\ngreat. Molinier's machine (Fig. 29), and that of Jones and Rocke, are\r\nwell adapted for skins, but hardly capable of fleshing an entire hide.\r\nAll these machines are very similar in principle, the working parts\r\nconsisting of drums with oblique or spiral knives.\r\n\r\nWhen unhaired and fleshed, the hides intended for sole-leather are, in\r\nEngland, almost invariably \"rounded,\" or separated into (1) \"butts,\"\r\nwhich are the best and thickest parts, and receive the most solid\r\ntannage, and (2) \"offal,\" which is thinner, and for which a cheaper and\r\nmore rapid tannage is sufficient. Fig. 30 shows the customary division.\r\nFrequently the butt is divided down the centre, and the halves are then\r\ncalled \"bends.\" A piece called a \"middle\" is sometimes taken between\r\nthe butt and the shoulder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.]\r\n\r\nAfter rounding, it is necessary to get rid of the lime, as completely\r\nas possible, before taking into the tan-house. For this purpose,\r\nthe butts are usually suspended in fresh water for 12-24 hours, and\r\nfrequently shaken up in it to remove adhering lime and dirt. If\r\nthe water is hard, it is best to add to it, before putting in the\r\nbutts, a few pailfuls of clear lime-water, to precipitate the lime\r\nbicarbonate,[T] which would otherwise cause a deposit of chalk on the\r\nsurface of the butts; this would not only make the grain harsh, but\r\nafterwards, by combining with the tannin of the liquors, would cause\r\nbad colour. For the same reasons, it is important that limey hides\r\nshould be as little exposed to the air as possible, as the latter\r\nalways contains a small amount of carbonic acid, which renders the lime\r\ninsoluble.\r\n\r\n[Footnote T: Lime softens water containing lime bicarbonate in\r\nsolution by combining with half the carbonic acid, when the whole is\r\nprecipitated as normal carbonate or chalk. CaO + CaCO_{3} . H_{2}CO_{3}\r\n= 2CaCO_{3} + OH_{2}. This is Clark's process. See also p. 84.]\r\n\r\nThis suspension in water is frequently considered sufficient for\r\nsole-leather, but it removes the lime very imperfectly. In olden days,\r\nit was customary not only to wash the hides much more thoroughly in\r\nwater, but to \"scud\" them (i.e. work them over with a blunt knife),\r\nto remove lime, and the detritus of hair-roots and fat-glands, and\r\nthis should never be omitted from sole-leather treatment where bright\r\ncolour and clean buff are desired. Some tanners go so far as to bate\r\nbest butts slightly with hen-dung, but with such treatment firmness\r\nand weight are lost. Washing in weak solution of sugar, or ammonic\r\nchloride or sulphate, or of sulphuric, or hydrochloric acid, may be\r\nadopted. It is essential to use acids nearly free from iron, as it may\r\nbe precipitated on the butts and give a bluish colour in the liquors,\r\nand the acid must be of such a strength as neither to allow the iron\r\nto be precipitated, nor, on the other hand, perceptibly to plump the\r\nbutts, which in this stage would endanger buff and colour. 100 _cc._\r\nmay neutralise 15-20 _cc._ of lime-water for this purpose. Hydrochloric\r\nacid and chlorides have a tendency to prevent plumping, and are\r\ntherefore better adapted for dressing than for sole leather. Great\r\ncare must also be taken to prevent putrefaction, or the use of putrid\r\nsolutions, if firmness and plumpness are desired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nSOLE-LEATHER.--Tanning Materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore describing the management of the hides in the tan-house, it\r\nis necessary to say a few words about one or two of the principal\r\nmaterials used, and the methods of preparing them for use. Further\r\ndetails of their nature and origin have been given in the section on\r\nTannins, p. 23.\r\n\r\nOak-bark is one of the oldest of tanning materials, and the leather\r\nproduced by its aid is still considered for many purposes the best. For\r\nsole-leather, its weakness in tannin (8-12 per cent.), the slowness\r\nof its action, and the light weight of the leather produced, render\r\nit unavailable alone except for the very finest class of work. It\r\nis, however, generally used in admixture with stronger and cheaper\r\nmaterials, such as valonia.\r\n\r\nValonia, the acorn-cup of an evergreen oak growing in Greece and the\r\nLevant, is perhaps the most important of materials to the English\r\nsole-leather tanner. It contains 25-35 per cent. of a tannin somewhat\r\nsimilar to oak-bark, and, like it, communicating a light-coloured bloom\r\nto the leather, but giving much greater firmness and weight, and a\r\nbrowner colour.\r\n\r\nMyrabolanes or myrobalans, the fruit of an Indian shrub, contains about\r\nas large a percentage of tannin as valonia, and gives a similar bloom,\r\nand excellent colour; but it can only be used very sparingly on butts,\r\nsince it produces a soft and porous leather.\r\n\r\nDivi-divi is a South American bean, which contains much of a brown\r\ntannin in the pod, being considerably stronger than valonia. It makes\r\na heavy and solid, but somewhat horny leather. Its great danger arises\r\nfrom a tendency to sudden fermentation in thundery weather, which,\r\nproduces brown or red stains on the leather. At all times it is liable\r\nto give a bluish or violet colour, which is most obvious in the\r\ninterior of the leather, and which resists both acids and alkalies.\r\n\r\nMimosa-bark is the product of several Australian acacias, and is\r\nprobably nearly as strong as valonia. It gives a hard and heavy\r\nleather, but of a dark-red colour.\r\n\r\nHemlock-extract is a deep-red syrupy extract of the bark of the hemlock\r\npine of America.\r\n\r\nChestnut-extract is a similar product from the rasped wood of the\r\nSpanish chestnut. Its colour is paler and yellower than that of the\r\nhemlock, and hence it is often employed to correct the red tone\r\nproduced by the latter.\r\n\r\nOakwood extract is an analogous preparation from oak saw-dust.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrinding and Exhaustion of Tanning Materials.\r\n\r\nBefore tanning materials can be exhausted, it is almost invariably\r\nnecessary to crush or grind them, so as to enable the water to get\r\nfreely at the tannin, which, in most cases, is enclosed in the cellular\r\ntissue of the plant. It may be thought that for this purpose it would\r\nscarcely be possible to crush too finely, but in practice, a very\r\nfine powder is extremely difficult to spend, as it cakes into compact\r\nand clay-like masses, through which liquor will not percolate. The\r\nobject, therefore, is to grind finely enough to allow the liquor\r\nready access to the interior, but not so finely as to prevent liquids\r\nrunning through the mass. The mill most usually employed for this\r\npurpose consists of a toothed cone, working inside another cone, also\r\ntoothed on its interior, precisely like those of a coffee-mill. As\r\nbark is frequently delivered \"unhatched,\" or in long pieces, it is\r\nnecessary to crush it preparatory to grinding, and this is usually\r\naccomplished by rollers composed of toothed discs, called breakers. In\r\nFig. 31 is illustrated such a mill, as made by Newall and Barker, of\r\nWarrington, combining both utensils. Fig. 32 shows a section of the\r\nwell-known American \"keystone\" mill, in which the preliminary breaking\r\nis accomplished by the arms A; the bark is then finely ground by the\r\ntoothed cones N, and discharged at the spout R by the revolving shover\r\nM. Fig. 33 shows a somewhat similar mill, made by Gläser of Vienna,\r\nin which the axis is horizontal, and driven directly by a belt. It is\r\nbetter to drive bark-mills by a belt than by toothed gearing, as in\r\nevent of iron getting into them there is less danger of breakage. In\r\nAmerica, a cheap cast-iron coupling is frequently used, weak enough to\r\ngive way before serious damage is done. Safety \"friction\" clutches are\r\ngenerally ineffective. American bark-mills are run faster than English,\r\nup to about 80 rev. per minute, and where the bark is to be used\r\nimmediately it is frequently damped by a small jet of steam below the\r\nmill, which lays dust, and prevents danger of fire. Bark which is damp\r\nbefore grinding can scarcely be ground in these toothed mills, but must\r\nbe dried, or a disintegrator used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.]\r\n\r\nNow that a large variety of other materials besides bark are required\r\nby tanners, the mills just described are not always sufficient for the\r\npurpose. Myrobalans and mimosa-bark have proved specially troublesome,\r\nthe former from its very hard stones and clogging character, and the\r\nlatter from its combined hardness and toughness. \"Disintegrators\" of\r\nvarious makes have proved admirably adapted for grinding both of these\r\nmaterials, their advantage being the universality of their reducing\r\npowers, ranging from oak-bark to bones or brick-dust, and their\r\ndisadvantages, the somewhat considerable power they consume, and the\r\nrather large portion of fine dust they make. Their principle is that\r\nof knocking the material to powder by rapidly revolving beaters,\r\nwhich, in the smaller mills, are driven at so high a speed as 2500-3000\r\nrev. a minute. Wilson's is shown in Fig. 34, as an example. It is one\r\nof the oldest tanners' disintegrators, and probably still one of the\r\nbest. In the figure, it is opened, showing the disc with its steel\r\nbeaters attached. When myrobalans are only required roughly crushed,\r\na machine with fluted or toothed rollers (Fig. 35) acts better than\r\na disintegrator, making less dust, and requiring less power. Such a\r\nmachine also crushes valonia very satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.]\r\n\r\nIn England, the tanning material is generally carried from the mill, to\r\nthe pits where it is exhausted, in baskets or barrows; in America, this\r\nis frequently accomplished by a \"conductor,\" or horizontal spout, in\r\nwhich a double belt, or malleable iron \"drive chain,\"[U] with wooden\r\ncross-pieces, carries the bark forward, on the same principle as the\r\nelevators of corn-mills. Fig. 36 shows the conveyors used in a Chicago\r\ntannery. Another American plan is to use circular tubs for extraction.\r\nThese are mounted on wheels, and are worked on a railway, coming up to\r\nthe mill to be filled, and thence under a series of sprinklers like\r\nthose used by brewers, and finally \"dumping\" their contents before\r\nthe boilers, which are heated solely by wet bark, burnt in a peculiar\r\nfurnace with brick chambers. This furnace for burning wet bark seems\r\nworthy of extended adoption in Europe, as spent tan is frequently\r\nnot only valueless, but costly to get rid of. Full details and scale\r\ndrawings may be found in Jackson S. Schultz's book on 'Leather\r\nManufacture' and in Fig. 37 is shown a modification of it, patented by\r\nHuxham and Brown, which has been very successfully used in burning wet\r\ntan, either alone or with a portion of coal. In American sole-leather\r\ntanneries, where the bark is resinous and almost unlimited in quantity,\r\nsufficient steam may be raised with tan wet from the leaches; but\r\nin England, where material is more sparingly used, it is advisable\r\npartially to dry it before burning. This is accomplished by powerful\r\nroller-presses, as shown in Fig. 38. Gläser, of Vienna, constructs\r\ntan-burning furnaces on a different principle from the American, the\r\nessential point being the use of a \"ladder-grate\" (_Treppenrost_), on\r\nwhich the burning tan is exposed to a draught of air playing over its\r\nsurface. Fig. 39 shows a portable stove of this construction. Gläser\r\nalso makes furnaces of larger size for heating air for drying-rooms,\r\nand for boiler purposes. The essentials of successful tan-burning\r\nare good draught, a large grate-surface, and a high temperature of\r\nthe combustion-chamber, and hence the ordinary Cornish or Lancashire\r\nboiler, with its limited grate-area, surrounded by the comparatively\r\ncool boiler-tube, is peculiarly ill-adapted for the purpose. The writer\r\nhas profitably burnt a mixture of wet tan and very small coal in such a\r\nboiler by the aid of a steam-jet under-grate blower, but such a method\r\ncan only be regarded as a makeshift in default of better appliances.\r\n\r\n[Footnote U: Such chains with attachments for elevators and conveyers,\r\nare manufactured in this country by Ley's Malleable Casting Company, in\r\nDerby.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37]\r\n\r\nIn England, the tanning material is usually exhausted in pits called\r\n\"leaches,\" \"latches,\" or \"taps.\" These, in large yards, are made\r\ncapable of holding about 50 cwt. of material. The new material is first\r\nflooded with a pretty strong liquor. When this has gained as much\r\nstrength as possible, it is pumped off, and is followed by a weaker\r\none, and so on till the material is exhausted. Much of the economy of\r\na tan-yard depends on the way, systematic or otherwise, in which this\r\nis done. It is customary to complete the exhaustion with hot liquors,\r\nor water, but opinions differ on the expediency of the practice. By\r\nthe use of heat, however, stronger liquors and more rapid spending are\r\nattained; and with some materials, such as mimosa, complete exhaustion\r\nis impossible in the cold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39.]\r\n\r\nThe worst tap is frequently boiled by inserting a steam-pipe; but if\r\nheat is used at all, it would probably be better to heat a strong\r\nliquor by a steam-coil, and run it on the new material, which would\r\nbe softened and swollen, and yield a much larger proportion of its\r\nstrength to the first liquor; while it is stated by Eitner that the\r\ncolouring matters of tanning materials are much less soluble in strong\r\nthan in weak infusions. Boiling weak old liquors containing lime is\r\nspecially prejudicial, causing great darkening and discoloration.\r\n\r\nCareful tanners also cast their material over from one pit into\r\nanother, before throwing away, so as to lighten it up, and allow\r\nthe liquor to penetrate to every part. In bark-yards, latches are\r\nfrequently worked in series, which are connected by pipes, so that the\r\nliquor flows from the bottom of one upon the top of the next stronger.\r\nThis is an excellent plan for bark, which is open and porous, but is\r\nscarcely adapted to such materials as valonia or myrabolans, which\r\nhave a tendency to form compact masses, through which the liquor does\r\nnot circulate. The same objection, in an almost higher degree, must be\r\nurged against the Allen and Warren, or sprinkler leach, in which the\r\nliquor, distributed on the surface by a rotary sprinkler, is allowed\r\nto percolate downwards, and run freely away at the bottom. In this\r\ncase, it is almost sure to form channels, instead of flowing uniformly,\r\nand, in addition, the material is constantly exposed to the action of\r\nthe air, which causes oxidation, with its attendant discoloration and\r\nloss of tannin. Various attempts have been made to exhaust tanning\r\nmaterials in closed vessels. Dr. Kohlrausch applied the _diffuseur_\r\nused in extracting beet-root sugar, and which consists of a series of\r\nclosed copper vessels in which the coarsely ground material is placed,\r\nof which the bottom of one is connected with the top of the next by\r\na pipe, through which the liquor is forced by steam pressure. This\r\napparatus is in use at the large tannery of Gerhardus, Flesch, and Co.,\r\nof Vienna, and is said to give satisfaction, though it is very costly,\r\nand the liquors produced are not of great strength. Gläser, of Vienna,\r\nhas patented an apparatus of which a model is illustrated in Fig. 40,\r\nin which the materials are used finely powdered, and very rapidly\r\nexhausted by the combined action of heat and mechanical agitation. Of\r\nits mechanism I have not been able to obtain any detailed description,\r\nbut it is said to be capable of exhausting 9 tons of valonia _per\r\ndiem_, to 2 per cent., giving only 70° liquors, clear and of good\r\ncolour, while good bark is exhausted to 0·5 per cent. giving 30°\r\nliquors. The cost of the apparatus is very heavy, but if the results\r\nclaimed are realised in practice it would pay well for an extensive\r\ntannery. I have not been able to ascertain where it is to be seen in\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40.]\r\n\r\nIt is one of the great attractions of extracts that they avoid almost\r\nall the expense and labour inseparable from the exhaustion of other\r\ntanning materials. It is usually necessary to dissolve the fluid\r\nextracts in water or liquor of as high a temperature as has been\r\nemployed in their preparation, as otherwise, from some unexplained\r\nchemical change, a large portion of the tannin is precipitated,\r\nprobably as an anhydride of the tannin. Gambier is usually dissolved by\r\nboiling or steaming, but is said to give a better colour when dissolved\r\ncold. This may be accomplished in a rotating latticed drum, sunk in a\r\npit of liquor.\r\n\r\nWhere circumstances permit, it is a great advantage to place the taps\r\neither on a higher or a lower level than the layers and handlers, so\r\nthat liquors may be run one way without pumping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSOLE-LEATHER.--Treatment in the Tan-house.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn first coming into the yard, the butts are usually suspended by\r\nthe shoulder or butt ends from sticks placed across the pits. They\r\nshould be kept in almost constant movement, either by raising and\r\nshaking them by hand, or by supporting them on frames, which are\r\nrocked, or otherwise worked. Perhaps the best device for this purpose\r\nis the \"travelling handler\" of W. N. Evans, which consists of a frame\r\nsupported on wheels, and worked slowly backwards and forwards by power.\r\nThis frame should extend the length of a range of pits sufficient to\r\ntake in at least a 3 days' stock of butts, which should be tied to\r\nsticks resting crossways upon it. It should have a stroke of 1-2 ft.,\r\nrepeated, say 6 times a minute. The power required is very small.\r\n\r\nThe American rocker consists of a wooden frame balanced on its centre,\r\nand made to oscillate by power. It is a cheap and efficient machine,\r\nits defects being that the butts at the ends are much more moved than\r\nthose in the centre, and that their upper parts, being lifted out of\r\nthe liquor, are liable to become blackened.\r\n\r\nThe suspender pits should be supplied with old handler liquors, which,\r\nif the tannage is a mixed one, may range from 12° to 20° barkometer,\r\nas a large proportion of the weight consists only of lime-salts,\r\ngallic acid, and other worthless products. It must here be explained\r\nthat the barkometer (also called \"barkrometer\" or \"barktrometer\") is a\r\nhydrometer, graduated to show the sp. gr. thus--20° Bark. = 1·020 sp.\r\ngr. In using it the temperature of the liquor must be at or near 60° F.\r\n(15° C.). It is, of course, affected by any other matters in solution,\r\nprecisely the same as by tannins. In the Lowlights Tannery the waste\r\nliquors are constantly about 12° Bark., and contain tannin equal to\r\nless than 0·2 per cent. (expressed as crystal oxalic acid), and gallic\r\nacid and similar matters equal to O·6 to 0·7 per cent. If the tannage\r\nis pure bark, it may perhaps be advisable to let the strength be\r\nsomewhat less, but something depends on whether the exhausted liquors\r\nare returned with all their impurities to the \"taps\" or liquor-brewing\r\npits, or whether the liquors are made with water, and hence purer. In\r\nany case, the free acid in the suspenders should always be sufficient\r\nin quantity to neutralise the lime brought in by the butts, or bad\r\ncolour will certainly result, making itself visible in the shed, or as\r\nthe tanning proceeds. If the butts, when first brought into liquor,\r\ntake a lemon-yellow colour, especially in places that have been\r\nimperfectly exposed to it, this is an indication of danger which must\r\nnot be disregarded. It may be met either by cleansing the butts more\r\nthoroughly before bringing into the yard, or by adding acid (acetic,\r\nhydrochloric, or sulphuric) to the liquor. If this be done, great care\r\nmust be taken not to over-do it, and an acid free from iron must be\r\nused. The use of sulphurous acid for the purpose has been patented, and\r\npresents some advantages. Sulphites have been observed by the writer\r\nto give a pink or purple reaction even with very dilute infusions of\r\nvalonia (see p. 112); but any coloration from this cause would probably\r\ndisappear as the tannage proceeds. The difficulty can, however, often\r\nbe remedied, either by altering the way of working the liquors, so\r\nas to bring more sour liquor down to the suspenders, or by using a\r\nlarger proportion of materials capable of yielding acetic acid by\r\nfermentation, such as myrobalans. It is a common error to call all the\r\nfree acid of sour liquors \"gallic,\" as this is scarcely present in pure\r\nbark-yards, and at the best is a very feeble acid. The most abundant\r\nacid is usually acetic, though butyric, lactic, and other acids are\r\nfrequently present in varying proportions, according to the tanning\r\nmaterials employed. In the English process, with its comparatively\r\nshort layers, in which the butts almost float in strong liquors, but\r\nlittle souring takes place, and we have nothing comparable to the\r\nGerman \"sour bark\" and \"sour liquor\" from long layers with weak liquor,\r\nand much dusty material. These contain large quantities of acetic\r\nand lactic acids, and plump almost like vitriol. Though the American\r\ntanners generally use the latter, their hemlock liquors sour much\r\nmore intensely than those of English yards. It must always be borne\r\nin mind, in comparing English with American and Continental tanning,\r\nthat, in the first, the opening up of the fibre is effected by lime,\r\nand the swelling is maintained in the liquors, not so much by acids,\r\nwhich are only present in very small proportion, as by the careful and\r\ngradual working forward into infusions stronger and stronger in tannin;\r\nwhile in the two latter, lime, if used at all, is simply employed to\r\nloosen the hair, and the swelling and differentiation of the fibre\r\nis first accomplished in the liquors either by vegetable or mineral\r\nacids. Hence good results cannot be expected in English yards from such\r\nprocesses as sweating or painting with sodium sulphide, which does not\r\nplump, without a radical modification of the whole tanning process.\r\nThis point has been ably treated by Eitner in a series of papers\r\non _Extract-gerberei_, published during the last few years in 'Der\r\nGerber,' which will well repay attentive perusal by English as well as\r\nGerman tanners.\r\n\r\nThe butts should at first be brought into the weakest liquor; a\r\ncirculation system, by which the liquors are all pumped in at one end\r\nof a set of suspenders, and run out at the other, the butts being moved\r\nforward in the opposite direction, seems to have much to recommend it.\r\nIn this case, the top of one pit should be connected by a wooden box\r\nwith the bottom of the next.\r\n\r\nIt is usually advisable to run away the first liquor into which butts\r\nare brought from the lime-yard, as it is very completely spent, and\r\nhighly charged with lime salts and impurities. Whether other exhausted\r\nliquors are to be retained or rejected is largely a question of\r\nclimate, and mode of working. In hot weather, such liquors, charged\r\nwith organised ferments (moulds, _bacilli_, and _bacteria_), are apt\r\nto cause ropiness, and other fermentive diseases of the liquors. This\r\ndanger may be lessened by boiling all spent liquors, so as to kill the\r\nferments, before running on the taps, or prevented by the free use\r\nof antiseptics, such as carbolic acid. Small doses of carbolic acid,\r\nhowever, are useless; at least 1/10 per cent. must be employed; and it\r\nmust be borne in mind that antiseptics prevent souring as well as other\r\nfermentations, and hence, where they are employed, other means must be\r\nadopted to maintain the necessary acidity. Such liquors are very liable\r\nto darken if boiled.\r\n\r\nThe suspender liquors should be acid enough freely to redden\r\nlitmus-paper. The present author has published a simple volumetric\r\nmethod for the determination of the free acid; 10 _cc._ of the\r\ncarefully filtered liquor is placed in a beaker, and clear lime-water\r\nis run in from a burette till permanent cloudiness is produced. The\r\nquantity of lime-water employed is that which the acid is capable of\r\nneutralising, without producing discoloration of the leather, and care\r\nmust be taken that the lime introduced with the butts does not exceed\r\nthis proportion. The explanation of the reaction is that dark-coloured\r\ntannates of lime are formed, which are dissolved by the free acid so\r\nlong as it remains in excess. It must be remembered that this process\r\nestimates all acids capable of retaining tannates of lime in solution,\r\nincluding some so feeble as to have practically no plumping effect.\r\nA liquor may have acidity equal to several _cc._ of lime-water, and\r\nyet react absolutely alkaline to methyl-orange (see p. 9), a colour\r\nwhich is distinctly reddened by small excess of acids, even so weak\r\nas gallic, which is barely acid to the taste. Hence, the acidity of\r\na liquor available for plumping may be taken as represented by the\r\nlime-water required to change the red of methyl-orange to yellow,\r\nand if the liquor does not redden methyl-orange it is incapable\r\nof plumping. If 5 or 10 drops of orange solution be added to the\r\npale filtered liquor from suspenders, there is no difficulty in\r\napproximately hitting the point of change, but great accuracy is\r\nnot to be expected. If the liquor will not filter clear, kaolin (see\r\np. 119) may be used to clear it. It is well to test the lime-water\r\noccasionally on 10 _cc._ of decinormal sulphuric or oxalic acid (p.\r\n96), to make certain of its constancy. Lime-water should be kept in a\r\nbottle with excess of lime, shaken occasionally, and a small quantity\r\nfiltered off as required. Liquors are frequently miscalled \"sour\" which\r\nare not acid, but putrid. Such liquors will not plump, but reduce and\r\nsoften hides placed in them. (Compare also p. 185). Suspender liquors\r\nusually consist mainly of liquors from the handler shift. If liquors be\r\nused direct from the leaches, they generally produce harsh grain and\r\nbad colour.\r\n\r\nFrom the suspenders, the butts are transferred to the \"handlers,\"\r\nwhere they are laid flat in the liquor. They are usually pulled over\r\nby hooks, which are very apt to scratch the grain. Sometimes strings\r\nare used, attached to the corners and held in notches or on pegs at the\r\nedge of the pit. Other tanners place a frame below the pack, with ropes\r\nat the four corners, by which it is raised sufficiently for the men to\r\ngrasp the top butts with their hands. This is only practicable in pits\r\nof ample size. In American yards, the handling is almost universally\r\nperformed by tying the sides with strings or fastening them in a long\r\nband by drawing the slit tail of one side through a hole in the nose\r\nof the next, and inserting a wooden \"key.\" The string of the sides is\r\nthen wound from one pit to another over a skeleton reel (Fig. 41).\r\nThis method is also used in the lime-yard, and is frequently employed\r\nin England to handle offal, but it is not well adapted for butts. Fig.\r\n42 shows the application of mechanical power in a Chicago yard for the\r\nsame purpose, by means of Ewart's drive-chain, which is manufactured in\r\nthis country by Ley's Malleable Castings Co., at Derby, to whom I am\r\nindebted for the block.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41.]\r\n\r\nThe handlers are generally worked in sets, to each of which a fresh\r\nliquor is daily run, and the most forward pack is pulled over into it,\r\nand is often also dusted down with a little fine bark or myrabolans.\r\nThe second pack follows into the liquor out of which the first has\r\nbeen taken; the third into that of the second, and so on. Frequently\r\nthe greenest packs are handled up a second time in the course of the\r\nday, and put down again in the same liquor. The strength of liquors,\r\nand the length of time for which butts are retained in the handlers,\r\nare varied; but a time of 1-2 months, and liquors of 20°-35° Bark.\r\nare usual. It is well to divide the handlers into at least two sets.\r\nGambier is very useful, especially to the greener goods, and if\r\nhemlock and other extracts are employed, their appropriate place is\r\nin the forward handlers or earlier layers. New valonia liquors must\r\nbe avoided, but old layer liquors of considerable strength (up to 40°\r\nBark. where the handling is long continued) may be employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of this period, the butts are taken to the \"layers\" or\r\n\"bloomers,\" in which they are laid down with stronger liquors and much\r\nlarger quantities of \"dust\"; the latter is usually bark or valonia,\r\nthough mimosa is occasionally used. The liquors vary from 40° to 60°\r\nor 70° Bark. in strength in mixed tannage, and the duration of each\r\nlayer from 10 days in the earlier stages to a month in the later ones.\r\nFor the best heavy tannages, 6-8 layers are required. Each time the\r\nbutts are raised, they should be mopped on the grain, to remove dirt\r\nand loose bloom. Strong valonia liquors, or heavy valonia dusting,\r\ncauses a brown sandy crust to form on the freely exposed parts of the\r\nbutts. This is removed in striking, but is sometimes very troublesome\r\non rough dried dressing leather. In pure bark tannage, which, however,\r\nis gradually becoming extinct, the liquors used are of necessity much\r\nweaker, as it is extremely difficult to obtain liquors of more than\r\n25°-30° Bark. from this material. The last layer, however, should\r\nalways have liquors of the greatest strength which can possibly be\r\nobtained, or the leather will be deficient in firmness.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving their last layer, the butts are well mopped or brushed\r\nand washed up in a clear liquor, and thrown over a horse to drain\r\nbefore going into the shed. In America, the Howard scrubber (Fig. 43)\r\nis generally employed instead of hand labour at this stage. It consists\r\nof 2 rotating wooden frames at the top of a pit, provided with brushes\r\nor birch-brooms, and, when in use, enclosed by a cover A, through a\r\nslit G in which the sides are inserted and drawn back, while water is\r\nsupplied by the pump B. Sometimes the brush-drums are placed one above\r\nanother, and the leather is passed in at the side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PL. VI.\r\n\r\n_E & F. N. Spon, London & New York._\r\n\r\n\"INK PHOTO\" SPRAGUE & CO. LONDON\r\n\r\nOPENING, STRETCHING AND STORING WHITE SKINS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43.]\r\n\r\nIn mixed tannages, where the colour is dark, the leather is frequently\r\nhandled or suspended in a warm sumach or myrobalanes liquor, and\r\noccasionally in dilute sulphuric or oxalic acids. If these acids are\r\nnot effectually removed before drying, the toughness of the leather\r\nwill be destroyed, and in extreme cases the leather will become brittle\r\nand refuse to take black. In any case, strong acids are prejudicial to\r\nthe durability of the leather. In America, alternate baths of vitriol\r\nand sugar of lead are frequently used for bleaching and weighting the\r\nleather, but the colour given is not durable.\r\n\r\nThe great point to aim at, in arranging the mode of work of a tannery,\r\nis to contrive that butts should always receive the strongest liquors\r\nthey can bear with safety, and that the strength should constantly\r\nincrease in a regular and systematic way. To attain this end, very\r\nfrequent handling and change of liquor are requisite in the early\r\nstages, when the butts rapidly absorb the tannin presented to them. As\r\nthe process advances, the exterior part of the butt becomes thoroughly\r\ntanned, and the liquor only slowly reaches the interior, which is yet\r\nsusceptible of its action, and hence longer layers in stronger liquors\r\nare permissible.\r\n\r\nThe varied requirements of the trade render it difficult to give any\r\npractical information as to the selection of tanning materials. As\r\na general rule, it is important at the outset to give the required\r\ncolour; and if materials undesirable in this respect are to be used for\r\nthe sake of cheapness, they should be introduced in the form of liquors\r\nin the middle stages of the process, i. e. in the later handlers or\r\nearlier layers. Materials used as dust generally have more effect in\r\nproducing bloom and colouring the leather, than those used in liquors\r\nat this stage. Some information as to the respective qualities of the\r\ndifferent tanning materials will be found in the chapter on Tannins;\r\nbut even practical men are very deficient in accurate information on\r\nthese points, since many materials are never used alone, but invariably\r\nin connection with others which mask their effects.\r\n\r\nThe use of extracts, and the demand for low-priced leathers, to\r\ncompete with the American tannages, has introduced still more rapid\r\nmethods than those described, and very fair-looking heavy leather has\r\nbeen tanned in 5-10 weeks. These tannages are very various, but their\r\nmain feature is the free use of hot liquors, composed principally of\r\nextracts and gambier. This treatment imparts great firmness, or more\r\nproperly speaking, hardness; but the leather is deficient in toughness,\r\nand the grain usually cracks on bending sharply. Extract properly used\r\nis, however, capable of making excellent leather; it is employed in at\r\nleast one of the highest priced tannages in the country.\r\n\r\nIt may be noted here, that when Continental writers speak of extracts\r\nand extract tannage, what we should call liquor tannage only is meant,\r\nand not specially the use of the concentrated extracts, to which alone\r\nin England the term is applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nSOLE-LEATHER.--Treatment in the Shed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44.]\r\n\r\nThe butts, after being treated as above described, are frequently oiled\r\nlightly on the grain, and are taken into the drying-lofts, where they\r\nare hung on poles till about half dry. They are then laid on the floor\r\nin piles, and covered up till they heat or \"sweat\" a little, which\r\nfacilitates the succeeding operation of \"striking.\" This is performed\r\nby laying the butt over a horizontal \"beam\" or \"horse,\" and scraping\r\nits surface with a triangular pin, shown at D in Fig. 25. This pin has\r\nan even, though tolerably sharp, edge, and is so used that it stretches\r\nand smooths out the grain, without breaking it; and at the same time\r\nit removes a portion of the white deposit called \"bloom,\" which has\r\nbeen mentioned. Common goods are frequently struck by the machine\r\nintroduced by Priestman, of Preston Brook, shown in Fig. 44; but the\r\nwork is not very uniform, and the leather is much compressed and\r\nstretched. For offal, the machine is a very useful one, and perfectly\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46.]\r\n\r\nButts are now generally struck by the very ingenious machine of\r\nWilson, whose name has also been mentioned in connection with the\r\ndisintegrator, and which is shown in Fig. 45. The arms carry blunt\r\nbrass or steel knives or sleekers, and work outwards from the centre,\r\nwhile the butt is carried backwards and forwards over the drum. Stones\r\nmay be substituted for the sleekers, when it is required to remove the\r\nbloom. The machine requires a firm foundation, as its reciprocating\r\nmotion causes considerable vibration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.]\r\n\r\nAfter a light oiling and a little further drying, the butt is laid on\r\na flat \"bed\" of wood or zinc, and is rolled with a brass roller loaded\r\nwith heavy weights. Various machines are also in use for this purpose.\r\nIn Fig. 46, is shown Wilson's spring butt-roller, in which the pressure\r\nis produced by springs immediately above the roller, which works\r\nbackward and forward over a flat table, beneath a fixed girder. In the\r\nlater patterns of this machine the roller is automatically reversed\r\nby a mechanical finger before coming to the edge of the butt. Fig. 47\r\nshows an adaptation of the American pendulum roller, which is specially\r\nsuited for refinishing Singapore kip sides and the commoner class of\r\ngoods, giving great firmness and a high gloss. Fig. 48 represents a\r\nmachine in which the roller is fixed, and works over a brass drum; it\r\nis specially adapted for offal, and, when used for butts, is apt to\r\nmake them \"baggy.\" In this machine, the reversing motion is obtained by\r\nusing two belts, one being crossed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48.]\r\n\r\nThe leather is now frequently coloured on the grain with a mixture,\r\nfor which each tanner has a recipe of his own, but usually consisting\r\nmainly of yellow ochre with size or liquor and oil in order to give\r\na gloss, and to hide uneven or dull colour, and, when sufficiently\r\ndry, is well brushed by hand or power, rolled a second time, and\r\ndried-off in a room gently heated by steam. This is the Bristol method\r\nof finishing. In the Lancashire district, butts are generally struck\r\nout much wetter, and \"stoned,\" so as to remove the whole of the bloom,\r\nand show the natural brown \"bottom\" of the grain. When sufficiently\r\ndry, they are struck a second time, to set the grain, and rolled as\r\ndescribed, the painting being omitted. This method has the disadvantage\r\nof requiring more labour, and causing a loss of weight; but leather so\r\ngot up brings a higher price, as the finish is only applicable to such\r\ntannages as make a fair colour. The usual London plan is a compromise\r\nbetween the Bristol and Lancashire methods; the leather is sammed, or\r\ntempered by partial drying and piling before striking; stoning is not\r\nresorted to, but the bloom is thoroughly removed from the surface with\r\nthe pin and scrubbing-brush. Colour is not generally used.\r\n\r\nIt is very important, and especially so with heavy mixed tannages,\r\nthat the drying should be conducted in the dark, and not too rapidly.\r\nNo artificial heat should be used, except in frosty weather, to wet\r\nleather; and it should be carefully protected from harsh drying\r\nwinds. After the leather is finished, it should be dried off in a\r\nwell-ventilated drying-shed, heated to about 70° F. (21° C.). The same\r\nobservations apply to the drying of rough dressing-leather, except that\r\nartificial heat should be avoided. Frost makes dressing-leather porous,\r\nand prevents it carrying a proper quantity of grease in currying. On\r\nthe construction of drying-sheds, see pp. 243-54.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nDRESSING LEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHides which are intended for purposes where softness and flexibility\r\nare required, as for instance, for the upper-leathers of boots, and\r\nfor saddlery purposes, are called \"dressing\" or \"common\" hides, or, if\r\nthey are shaved down to reduce their thickness before tanning, they are\r\ndenominated \"shaved\" hides. Hides for this purpose are limed much in\r\nthe same way as has been described for butts; but if they are required\r\nvery soft and flexible, a somewhat longer liming is permissible. After\r\nunhairing, fleshing, and washing in water, they are usually transferred\r\nto a \"bate,\" composed of pigeon- or hen-dung, in the proportion of\r\nabout 1 peck to 25-30 hides.\r\n\r\nIn this they are retained for some days, being handled frequently.\r\nThey completely lose their plumpness, and become soft and slippery;\r\nthe caustic lime is entirely removed; and the remaining portions of\r\nhair-sheaths and fat-glands are so loosened that they are easily worked\r\nout by a blunt knife on the beam. This final cleansing process is\r\ncalled \"scudding.\" The theory of the action of the \"bate,\" or \"pure,\"\r\nas it is sometimes called, is somewhat imperfect. It is frequently\r\nattributed to the action of ammonia salts, and phosphates, contained\r\nin the fermenting dung. Ammonia salts certainly will remove caustic\r\nlime, free ammonia being liberated in its place, and weak solutions\r\nof ammonia sulphate or chloride will rapidly reduce hides, and remove\r\nor neutralise the lime. The phosphates in dung are mostly, if not\r\nentirely, in the form of lime phosphate, which is quite inert. In\r\npoint of fact, the process seems to be a fermentive one, the active\r\nbate swarming with _bacteria_; to this, rather than to its chemical\r\nconstituents, its action must be attributed. The _bacteria_ act not\r\nonly on the organic constituents of the dung, but on those of the hide,\r\nproducing sulphuretted hydrogen, together with tyrosin and leucin,\r\nand other weak organic acids, which neutralise and remove the lime,\r\nand, at the same time, soften the hide by dissolving out the coriin,\r\nand probably also portions of the gelatinous fibre. The truth of this\r\ntheory is supported by the fact that, in warm weather, the activity\r\nof the bate is greatly increased, and that, if one pack of hides is\r\nover-bated, the next following is much more severely affected, the\r\nhides having in fact themselves furnished food for the multiplication\r\nof the bacterian ferment from the destruction of their own tissues.\r\nIt also explains the effective use (as a substitute) of warm water\r\nwith a very small portion of glucose, which, in itself, would be\r\ninsufficient to dissolve the lime, but with a small quantity of\r\nnitrogenous matter, forms an excellent _nidus_ for the multiplication\r\nof these organisms. An American invention for bating is the use of old\r\nlime-liquor neutralised with sulphuric acid, an idea which is much more\r\nscientific than would at first sight appear. Old lime-liquors, as we\r\nhave seen (p. 143) contain much ammonia and weak organic acids, such as\r\ncaproic, amidocaproic (leucin), and tyrosin. On adding sulphuric acid,\r\nthe lime forms an inert sulphate, and the sulphate of ammonia and the\r\nweak organic acids which remain dissolved are just what are required\r\nin a chemical bate. The lime-liquor should of course be filtered or\r\nsettled clear before using, and enough acid added barely to neutralise\r\nthe lime, and the liquor again settled or filtered. By this means both\r\nthe dissolved gelatin and the iron of the acid will be got rid of. The\r\nliquor might then be slightly acidified before use. The writer has no\r\nexperience of the method, but imagines that used as described it might\r\nbe worth trying, although it would have a very unpleasant smell. In\r\nthis connection may be mentioned the fact that, when bran drenches\r\nare used, in which lactic acid is developed, the butyric fermentation\r\nis liable, in hot weather, to take its place, and as butyric acid is\r\na powerful solvent of gelatinous tissue, and the dissolved tissue\r\nitself feeds the fermentation, rapid destruction of the skins is the\r\nresult. Cleanliness, scalding out of the drench vats, and washing the\r\nbran before using with cold water to remove adhering flour, are useful\r\nprecautions.\r\n\r\nIf the removal of the lime be the only object aimed at in bating, the\r\nordinary process is most wasteful, as well as disgusting, from the loss\r\nof pelt it entails. It is easy to find chemical reagents which will\r\nremove the lime; but the resultant leather has been found wanting in\r\nsoftness, and it is probable that the solution of the inter-fibrillar\r\nmatter is in many cases advantageous. Probably one reason for the\r\nnon-use of such chemicals is their expense. Maynard has patented the\r\nuse of sulphurous acid for the purpose. If sugar, glucose, or ammonia\r\nsalts be used, and the alkalinity of the solution nearly neutralised\r\nafter each lot of hides by common vitriol, the same liquor may be used\r\nagain and again. In this case, if iron is contained in the acid it will\r\nbe precipitated by the ammonia and must be settled out. The writer is\r\nconvinced, from his own experience, that with suitable tannage such\r\nbating would yield better weights and quite as satisfactory leather for\r\nmany purposes as the ordinary mode. French tanners, by the free use of\r\nwater, and careful working at the beam, and the employment of very weak\r\nliquors at the commencement of tanning, make excellent dressing leather\r\nwithout bating and this is also true of the celebrated French calf.\r\n\r\nThe bating required may be shortened, and probably with advantage, by\r\nwashing the hides with warm water in a \"tumbler,\" or rotating drum,\r\nFig. 49, prior to putting them into the bate, or the whole bating may\r\nbe done in the tumbler. After a short bating, also, the hides may be\r\nsoftened and cleansed by stocking for 15-20 minutes. Warm bates act\r\nmuch more rapidly than cold ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49.]\r\n\r\nVarious machines have been proposed to take the place of hand-labour\r\nin the beam work, and, at least as regards the smaller skins, with\r\nconsiderable success. As a type of these, may be mentioned Molinier's\r\nhide-working machine, Fig. 29, which consists of a drum covered with\r\nhelical knives, rotating at a speed of about 500 rev. a minute, over a\r\ncylinder coated with india-rubber. The skin is allowed to be drawn in\r\nbetween these drums, and the two being pressed together by a treadle,\r\nit is drawn out by a mechanical arrangement in a direction contrary to\r\nthe rotation of the knives, which scrape off the flesh, or work off the\r\nhair.\r\n\r\nAfter bating, \"shaved\" hides are reduced in thickness in the stronger\r\nparts by a shaving-knife, on an almost perpendicular beam. The workman\r\nstands behind the beam, and works downwards. The knife is represented\r\nat A, Fig. 26, and is a somewhat peculiar instrument. The blade is of\r\nsoftish steel, and after sharpening, the edge is turned completely over\r\nby pressure with a blunt tool, so as to cut at right angles to the\r\nblade. There is an obvious economy in shaving before tanning, since the\r\nraw shavings are valuable for glue-making, while, if taken off by the\r\ncurrier, they are useless for this purpose. The hide also tans faster.\r\n\r\nInstead of shaving, the untanned hide is frequently split, by drawing\r\nit against a rapidly vibrating knife. The piece removed is tanned for\r\nsome inferior purpose, if sufficiently perfect. In sheep-skins, which\r\nare split by a special machine, the grain-side is tanned for French\r\nmorocco or basil, while the flesh-side is dressed with oil, and forms\r\nthe ordinary chamois or wash-leather (see p. 210). Such a machine is\r\nshown in Fig. 50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50.]\r\n\r\nTanned leather is frequently split by forcing it against a fixed knife,\r\nas in the American \"Union\" machine, Fig. 51. This is however being\r\ngradually superseded by the band-knife splitting machine, Fig. 52, in\r\nwhich an endless steel blade travels over two pulleys like a belt, and\r\nis kept constantly sharpened by a pair of emery-wheels seen below the\r\nmachine. I am indebted for the block to Messrs. Haley and Co., who have\r\nmade great numbers of these machines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51.]\r\n\r\nAfter bating, scudding, and shaving, the hides are taken into the\r\ntan-house, where they are grained, either by frequent handling, or by\r\nworking in a paddle-tumbler (a vat agitated with a paddle-wheel, and\r\nknown in America as an \"England wheel\"), with a liquor of suitable\r\nstrength. What this strength should be depends on whether a well-marked\r\ngrain is required or not. The stronger the liquor, the more it\r\ncontracts the hide, wrinkling the surface into a network of numberless\r\ncrossing furrows, which form the well-known marking of \"grain-leather.\"\r\nIn bark tannage, the after management is much like that described with\r\nsole-leather, except that weaker infusions are employed, and acid\r\nliquors, which would swell the hide and produce a harsh leather, are\r\navoided. In old-fashioned country yards, which produce some of the best\r\nbark-tanned shaved hides, the liquors rarely range above 10°-15° of\r\nthe barkometer, and the time employed is 3-6 months. The hides, after\r\npassing through a set of handlers, of gradually increasing strength, in\r\nwhich they are at first moved every day, are laid away with bark liquor\r\nand a good dusting of bark, receiving perhaps 4-5 layers of 2-4 weeks\r\neach. Unfortunately, these tannages are so unprofitable that they are\r\nrapidly being supplanted by quicker and cheaper methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52.]\r\n\r\nThese more rapid and cheap tannages mostly depend on the use of \"terra\"\r\n(block or cube gambier) in combination with bark, valonia, mimosa,\r\nand myrobalanes. Liquors warmed to 110° or even 140° F. (43°-60° C.)\r\nare frequently employed, and a bright colour is finally imparted by\r\nhandling in a warm sumach or myrobalanes liquor, which dissolves out\r\nmuch of the colour imparted by terra or extracts. The tannage is helped\r\nforward by frequent handling, by working in tumblers, or sometimes by\r\nsuspension on rocking or travelling frames, after the American fashion.\r\n\r\nTo this class of tannage belongs that of East India kips, which is\r\nlargely carried on in the neighbourhood of Leeds. These kips are\r\nthe hides of the small cattle of India, and are imported in a dried\r\ncondition, and with their flesh-side protected (and loaded) with a coat\r\nof salt and whitewash or plaster. They are usually softened in putrid\r\nsoaks, and unhaired with lime, and are used in England for many of the\r\npurposes for which calf-skins were formerly employed. A variety of East\r\nIndia kips, called \"arsenic kips,\" are treated (instead of plastering)\r\nwith a small quantity of arsenic before drying, to prevent the ravages\r\nof insects, which are often very destructive to these goods. Many kips\r\ntanned in India have also been imported of late years, and have greatly\r\ninterfered with the profits of English tanners.\r\n\r\nIn yards where the leather is intended to be sold uncurried, it is\r\ntaken up into the drying-sheds, well oiled on the grain with cod-liver\r\noil, and either simply hung on the poles to dry, or stretched with a\r\n\"righter,\" a tool shaped somewhat like a spade-handle, and finally\r\nset out with it to a smooth and rounded form. As in the case of\r\nsole-leather, too much light or wind must be avoided, and it is very\r\ndifficult to use artificial heat successfully in the early stages\r\nof the process. It is, however, now very common for the tanner who\r\nproduces such leather also to curry it, and, as this effects a\r\nconsiderable economy, both in labour and material, it is likely to\r\nbecome universal. When leather is to be sold rough, it is necessary\r\nto tan it in such a way as to give it a white appearance, from the\r\ndeposit of \"bloom\" already mentioned; this being regarded by curriers\r\nas an essential mark of a good tannage, although the first step in\r\nthe currying process is to completely scour it out. When the tanner\r\ncurries his own leather, he of course aims at putting in as little\r\nbloom as possible, thus economising both tanning material and labour.\r\nIn addition, the leather goes direct from the tan-house to the\r\ncurrying-shops, thus saving both drying and soaking again, and, it is\r\nsaid, giving better weight and quality. The tanner, too, is enabled to\r\nshave his hides or skins more completely, utilising the material for\r\nglue-stuff, which, had the leather been for sale in the rough, must\r\nhave been left on to obtain a profitable weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nCURRYING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general terms, the process of currying consists in softening,\r\nlevelling, and stretching the hides and skins which are required for\r\nthe upper-leathers of boots, and other purposes demanding flexibility\r\nand softness, and in saturating or \"stuffing\" them with fatty matters,\r\nnot only in order to soften them, but to make them watertight, and to\r\ngive them an attractive appearance.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that great differences must be made in the currying\r\nprocess, according to the character of the skin and the purpose for\r\nwhich it is intended, since the preparation of French calf for a light\r\nboot, and of the heaviest leather for machine belting, equally lie\r\nwithin the domain of currying. In this case, however, as in that of\r\ntanning, the clearest idea of the general principles involved will\r\nbe gained by taking a typical case, and afterwards pointing out the\r\ndifferent modifications needed for other varieties. The French method\r\nof currying waxed calf is selected as an example, since the well-known\r\nexcellence of this leather makes it interesting to compare the details\r\nwith the methods ordinarily in use in this country.\r\n\r\nAfter raising the skins from the pits, and beating off the loose tan,\r\nthey are hung in the sheds till partially dry (_essorage_), great\r\ncare being taken that the drying is uniform over the whole skin. In\r\nmodern shops, this drying is usually accomplished at once, and in a\r\nvery satisfactory manner, by means of a hydraulic press. If dried in\r\nthe air, they must be laid in pile for a short time to equalise the\r\nmoisture, and then brushed over on flesh and grain. The next process\r\nconsists in paring off loose flesh and inequalities (_dérayage_).\r\nThis is done on a beam, and with a knife similar to that used in\r\nbate-shaving, and shown in A, Fig. 26. This knife has the edge turned\r\nby rubbing with a strong steel, and is called _couteau à revers_.\r\n\r\nNext follows the _mise au vent_. The skins are first placed in a tub\r\nwith water or weak tan-liquor for 24 hours; they are then folded and\r\nplaced in a tub with enough water to cover them, and beaten with wooden\r\npestles for 1/4 hour. At the present day, stocks (_foulon vertical_),\r\nor a \"drum-tumbler\" (_tonneau à fouler_), a machine on the principle\r\nof the barrel-churn, usually take the place of this hand-labour. The\r\nskin is next placed on a marble table, flesh upwards, and with one\r\nflank hanging somewhat over the edge, and is worked with a \"sleeker\" or\r\nstretching-iron (_étire_), B, Fig. 26. The first 2 strokes are given\r\ndown and up the back, to make the skin adhere to the table, and it is\r\nthen worked out regularly all round the side on the table, so as to\r\nstretch and level it. The flesh is then washed over with a grass-brush\r\n(_brosse à chien-dent_), the skin is turned, and the other flank is\r\ntreated in the same way. It is lastly folded in 4, and steeped again\r\nin water. The next process is the cleansing of the grain. The skin is\r\nspread again on the table, as before, but grain upwards, and is worked\r\nover with a stone (_cœurse_), set in handles, and ground to a very\r\nobtuse edge. This scours out the bloom; after washing the grain with\r\nthe grass-brush, it is followed by the sleeking-iron, as on the flesh.\r\n\r\nThe next step is resetting (_retenage_). For this, except in summer,\r\nthe skins must be dried again, either by press or in the shed. This is\r\nanother setting out with the sleeker, and, the skin being dried, it\r\nnow retains the smoothness and extension which is thus given to it.\r\nThe skins are now ready for oiling in the grain, for which whale-oil\r\nor cod-liver oil is generally employed. Olive-oil, castor-oil, and\r\neven linseed-oil may, however, be used, and are sometimes made into an\r\nemulsion with neutral soap and water. After oiling the grain, the skins\r\nare folded and allowed to lie for 2-3 days before oiling the flesh.\r\n\r\nThe oiling on the flesh is done with a mixture of _dégras_ and tallow,\r\nin such proportions as not to run off during the drying. _Dégras_ is\r\nthe surplus oil from the chamois-leather manufacture, which in France\r\nis effected by daily stocking the skins with oil, and hanging in the\r\nair for oxidation. The _dégras_ (_toise_, _moëllon_) is obtained,\r\nnot by washing the skins in an alkaline lye, as in the English and\r\nGerman method, but by simple pressing or wringing. This oil, altered\r\nby oxidation, is so valuable for currying purposes that skins are\r\nfrequently worked simply for its production, being oiled and squeezed\r\nagain and again till not a rag is left. It is generally mixed in\r\ncommerce with more or less of ordinary fish-oil. Eitner recommends,\r\nwhere the _dégras_ is of indifferent quality, a mixture of 65 parts\r\n_dégras_, 20 of neutral soap (i. e. soap without the usual excess\r\nof alkali), and 15 of soft tallow. After oiling the flesh, which\r\nis accomplished by extending the skin on the marble table with the\r\nsleeker, and applying grease with a sheep-skin pad, it is hung to dry\r\nat a temperature of 65°-70° F. (18°-21° C.). After drying, the surplus\r\noil is removed by a fine sleeker from both flesh and grain, and the\r\nskins are ready for \"whitening\" (_blanchissage_). This consists in\r\ntaking a thin shaving off the flesh, and was originally accomplished\r\nby the shaving-knife on the currier's beam, and some curriers are\r\nstill in favour of this method. It is now, however, usually done\r\nby a sleeker with a turned edge. The grain then undergoes a final\r\nstoning and sleeking, to remove the last traces of adhering oil, and\r\nthe skin is grained by rubbing it in a peculiar way under a pommel\r\ncovered with cork. It is then coated on the flesh with a mixture, of\r\nwhich the following is a specimen:--5 parts of lamp-black are rubbed\r\nwith 4 of linseed-oil, and 35 parts of fish-oil are added; 15 parts\r\nof tallow and 3 of wax are melted together and added to the mixture;\r\nand, after cooling, 3 parts of treacle. This compound is put on with a\r\nbrush, and allowed to dry for some days. Finally, the skins are sized\r\nover with a glue-size, which is sometimes darkened by the addition of\r\naniline-black.\r\n\r\nThe preceding account will give some idea of the care and labour\r\nexpended on these goods in France. In England, cheaper productions are\r\nmore in vogue, and almost every process is accomplished by machinery.\r\nAn illustration of the Fitzhenry or Jackson scouring-machine, which is\r\nlargely employed both for scouring and setting out, is given in Fig.\r\n53. This is a simple and efficient machine, and has been largely used,\r\nboth here and in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.]\r\n\r\nFig. 54 shows the improved tool-carriage introduced by C. Holmes of\r\nBoston, in which the brush and sleekers or stones are controlled by\r\nhandles which are stationary instead of moving rapidly with the slide,\r\nas in the older form. Spiral springs are also substituted for the older\r\nelliptical ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55.]\r\n\r\nThe Fitzhenry machine has also been constructed so as to work in any\r\ndirection over a fixed table, being driven by a small direct-acting\r\nsteam-cylinder supplied by jointed pipes. But probably the most perfect\r\nscouring and setting machine which has yet been introduced is the\r\nLockwood Automatic Scourer, which may also be regarded as a development\r\nof the Fitzhenry machine. This has been some years in use in America\r\nwith great success, and has received considerable improvements, but has\r\nonly very recently been introduced into England by Messrs. Schrader and\r\nMitchell of Glasgow, who have kindly furnished the annexed illustration\r\n(Fig. 56). In this machine the table is fixed, and the tool-carriage\r\ncan be moved over it in every direction. The large projecting carriage,\r\nor cross-head, which supports it, travels on a horizontal rail, which\r\nmay be observed below and behind the table. Motion is given to it by a\r\nscrew which is driven in either direction by the pulleys at each side\r\nof the cross-head. In a similar way the tool-carriage is traversed\r\nforwards or backwards by a second screw at right angles to the first,\r\nand by a most ingenious interlocking arrangement both screws are\r\ncontrolled by a single handle. The tool-carriage or \"trundle frame\"\r\ncan also be turned like a turntable, so as to deliver its stroke in\r\nany direction, the tool-holder being driven by a horizontal crank\r\nin the centre of the frame, and immediately above the tools. Though\r\nthe machine is complicated, and necessarily expensive, it has not been\r\nfound either in America or Scotland difficult to work or liable to\r\nget out of order, while both the quantity and quality of its work are\r\nall that can be desired. Fig. 55 is Gläser's scouring machine. Fig.\r\n57 illustrates the latest English scouring machine, Messrs. Haley and\r\nCo.'s Climax Scourer, which is also ingenious and effective. In it the\r\ntable instead of the tool-holder is movable by screws driven by belts\r\nthrown into gear by a handle, and it is provided with two tables of\r\nwhich one is in work while the hides are being changed and spread on\r\nthe other. The oscillating tool-holder, instead of being actuated by\r\nthe rise and fall of the connecting-rod, is moved by an adjustable\r\neccentric.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of strap-butts, the currying is, of course, far less\r\nelaborate. They are well scoured out, heavily stuffed, and stretched in\r\nscrew-frames, to prevent their giving afterwards when in use.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, a method of stuffing strap-butts\r\nis frequently employed, which, so far as I am aware, is not in use in\r\nEngland. It is called _Einbrennen_ or \"burning in,\" and consists in\r\napplying very hot tallow to the dry leather. The butts are washed free\r\nfrom liquor in a tumbler, boarded to soften them thoroughly, scoured,\r\nset out with a sleeker, nailed on laths, and air-dried. They are then\r\nvery completely dried in a room heated to 104°-113° F. (40°-45° C.),\r\nas if any moisture remains in the hide, the fibre will be destroyed by\r\nthe heat of the melted tallow. The tallowing generally takes place in\r\nthe same room, as a high temperature is required to allow it to soak\r\nin, and the leather would greedily reabsorb moisture if exposed to\r\ndamp air. The tallow is heated, generally by steam in a jacketed pan,\r\nto 167°-212° F. (75°-100° C.). There are two ways of applying it. The\r\nmelted tallow may be applied on a table to the flesh side of the butt\r\nwith a ladle, and rubbed on with a brush or rag. In this case, as soon\r\nas the tallow has sufficiently soaked in, the butts are placed in water\r\nto prevent its striking through to the grain. The second way is to\r\nhave the pan of sufficient size and suitable shape, and for two men to\r\ndraw the butt through the melted tallow with tongs, and more or less\r\nrapidly according to the quantity it is desired that the leather should\r\nabsorb; and in some cases the process is repeated once or more. In this\r\ncase, it is useless to wet in water, and the butts are allowed to cool\r\ngradually in pile.\r\n\r\nThe leather is now impregnated with grease, but it is far from being\r\nproperly stuffed. Instead of the grease being spread over the finest\r\nfibres in a minute state of division, it simply fills the spaces\r\nbetween the larger fibres. To remedy this, the butts are well softened\r\nin water (which, if they have been drawn through the tallow and allowed\r\nto cool, must be tepid), and are then worked in a damp condition in a\r\ndrum tumbler, by which they brighten in colour and become uniformly\r\nstuffed. They are then allowed to lie in a pile a day or two, are\r\nstoned and worked out with the sleeker, and hung up to dry. When in\r\nright temper they receive a final setting out with the sleeker, and\r\nwhen dry are either rolled or glassed. For further details, Nos.\r\n256 and 257 of 'Der Gerber,' 1885, must be consulted, where the\r\nmatter has been exhaustively treated by Eitner, in his papers on\r\n\"Extract-Gerberei.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58.]\r\n\r\nIn England, curried leathers are generally sold by weight, which\r\nleads to the use of glucose and other materials to add to the weight.\r\nIn America, all upper leathers are sold by measure, and this is\r\nnow ascertained by a very ingenious machine (Fig. 58). The skin is\r\nlaid on a latticed table, and a frame, from which rows of bullets\r\nare suspended, is let down upon it. The total weight of the frame\r\nis indicated by a spring balance, and as the bullets which are over\r\nthe skin are supported by it, the diminution of weight indicates the\r\nmeasurement. Several modified forms of this machine are now made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nENAMELLED, PATENT, OR JAPANNED LEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are terms used to designate those leathers, whether of the ox,\r\nthe horse, the calf, or the seal, which are finished with a waterproof\r\nand bright varnished surface, similar to the lacquered wood-work of\r\nthe Japanese. The name \"enamelled\" is generally applied when the\r\nleathers are finished with a roughened or grained surface, and \"patent\"\r\nor \"japanned\" are the terms used when the finish is smooth. Though\r\ngenerally black, yet a small quantity of this leather is made in a\r\nvariety of colours.\r\n\r\nIn America, large thin hides are principally used for the purpose.\r\nThey are limed and bated in the usual way, stoned after bating, and\r\ntanned with hemlock and oak barks in a paddle tumbler, which is run for\r\n10-15 minutes in each hour. When one-third tanned, they are levelled\r\non the flesh, and split with the belt-knife splitter, Fig. 52. After\r\nsplitting, the portions are drummed with strong gambier liquor for 1/4\r\nhour, and then tanned out with bark. The grains are scoured with the\r\nFitzhenry or Lockwood machine (Figs. 53 and 56). They are then lightly\r\noiled and stretched on frames which can be enlarged by screws or a sort\r\nof knuckle-joint at the corners. When quite dry, they are grounded with\r\na mixture of linseed-oil with white lead and litharge, boiled together\r\nand thickened with chalk and ochre. This is dried in closets heated by\r\nsteam, into which the frames are slid face downwards, the heat being\r\ngradually increased from 80° to 160° F. (27° to 71° C.). If it be\r\ndesired to employ a higher temperature, the leather is first saturated\r\nwith a solution of 2 oz. each of borax and alum in 1 gal. water, when\r\ntemperatures of 230°-250° F. (110°-120° C.) may be used. The remaining\r\ntreatment is much as above described, but a little turpentine is used\r\nto make the paint work freely. The final varnish is composed of 20\r\nparts spirit of turpentine, 20 linseed oil, 10 thick copal varnish,\r\nand 1 of asphaltum or other colouring material. This must be mixed 2-3\r\nweeks before use, and applied with a brush.\r\n\r\nThe splits are also often enamelled, and as a preparation receive a\r\ndressing of linseed-oil boiled to a jelly and thinned with turpentine\r\nor naphtha. This is applied with a stiff brush after the splits are\r\nstretched on the frames and are still damp, so that it does not\r\npenetrate the leather, but forms a sort of artificial grain.\r\n\r\nLeather destined to be finished in this way requires to be curried\r\nwithout the use of much dubbing, and to be well softened. The English\r\npractice is to nail the skins thus prepared, and quite dry, on large\r\nsmooth boards, fitted to slide in and out of stoves maintained at a\r\ntemperature of 160°-170° F. (71°-77° C.), coating them repeatedly with\r\na sort of paint composed (for black) of linseed-oil, lamp-black, and\r\nPrussian blue, well ground together. Each coating is allowed to dry in\r\nthe stoves, before the next is applied. The number of coatings varies\r\nwith the kind of skin under treatment, and the purpose for which it is\r\nintended. The surface of every coat must be rubbed smooth with pumice;\r\nfinally, a finishing coat of oil-varnish is applied, and, like the\r\npreceding coats, is dried in the stove. The exact degrees of dryness\r\nand flexibility, the composition of the paint, and the thickness and\r\nnumber of the coats, are nice points, difficult to describe in writing.\r\n\r\nThis branch of the leather industry, so far as it relates to\r\ncalf-skins, is carried on to a larger extent, and has been brought\r\nto greater perfection in Germany and France than in England. In the\r\nformer countries, the heat of the sun is employed to dry some of the\r\ncoatings. The United States have also brought this style to a high\r\ndegree of excellence, especially in ox-hides. There, use is said to\r\nbe made of the oils and spirits obtained from petroleum, and without\r\ndoubt, French and German emigrant workmen have materially assisted in\r\nattaining this high standard.\r\n\r\nLeather finished in these styles is used for slippers, parts of shoes,\r\nharness, ladies' waist-belts, hand-bags, &c., and has now maintained a\r\nplace among the varieties of leather for a long period of years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMOROCCO LEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorocco leather is produced from goat-skins. Rough-haired or\r\n\"blue-back\" seal-skins are also used, and produce an excellent article;\r\nwhile an inferior description, called \"French morocco,\" is produced\r\nfrom sheep-skins. The skins are unhaired by liming in the usual way,\r\nand are then baited with a mixture of dogs' dung and water. The tanning\r\nis done chiefly with sumach, at first in paddle-tumblers, and then in\r\nhandlers, lasting about a month in all. Sheep-skins are usually tanned\r\nthrough in about 24 hours, by being sewn up into bags, grain-side\r\noutwards, and nearly filled with strong sumach infusion. A little air\r\nis then blown in, to completely distend the skin, and they are floated\r\nin a sumach bath, and kept moving by means of a paddle. After the\r\nfirst day's immersion, they are thrown up on a shelf, and allowed to\r\ndrain; they are then again filled with sumach liquor; when this has\r\na second time exuded through the skin, they are sufficiently tanned,\r\nand the sewing being ripped open, they are washed and scraped clean,\r\nand hung up to dry, making what are called \"crust-roans.\" The dyeing\r\nis sometimes done by brushing on a table, grain-side upwards, but more\r\nusually the skins are folded closely down the back, flesh-side inwards,\r\nso as to protect it as much as possible from the influence of the\r\ncolour, and then passed through the dye-bath, which is now generally of\r\naniline colours. The original oriental method of manufacture for red\r\nmorocco was to dye with cochineal before tanning, and this is still\r\ncustomary in the East, but is quite obsolete in this country. A grain\r\nor polish is given to the leather, either by boarding, or by working\r\nunder small pendulum rollers, called \"jiggers,\" which are engraved\r\neither with grooves or with an imitation of grain. A well-cleaned\r\nsumach-tanned skin is capable of being dyed in the finest shades of\r\ncolour; and this branch of the manufacture of leather has been brought\r\nto great perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nRUSSIA LEATHER (Ger., _Juchtenleder_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is tanned in Russia with, the bark of various species of willow,\r\npoplar and larch, either by laying away in pits, or handling in\r\nliquors, much like other light leathers, the lime being first removed\r\nby bating, either in a drench of rye- and oat-meal and salt, by\r\ndogs' dung, or by sour liquors. After tanning, the hides are again\r\nsoftened and cleansed by a weak drench of rye- and oat-meal. They are\r\nthen shaved down, carefully sleeked and scoured out, and dried. The\r\npeculiar odour is given by saturating them with birch-bark oil, which\r\nis rubbed into the flesh-side with cloths. This oil is produced by\r\ndry distillation of the bark and twigs of the birch. The red colour\r\nis given by dyeing with Brazilwood; and the diamond-shaped marking by\r\nrolling with grooved rollers.\r\n\r\nMuch of the leather now sold as \"Russia\" is produced in Germany,\r\nFrance, and England. It is tanned in the customary way, occasionally\r\nwith willow, but more generally with oak-bark, and probably other\r\nmaterials. Economy would suggest the use of such materials as, from\r\ntheir red colour, are objectionable for other purposes, and therefore\r\ncheap. The currying is in the usual manner, care being taken that the\r\noil used does not strike through to the grain, which would prevent\r\nit taking the dye. The colour is given by grounding with a solution\r\nof chloride of tin (100 parts tin perchloride, 30 parts nitric acid,\r\n25 parts hydrochloric acid, allowed to stand some days, and the\r\nclear solution poured off, and mixed with 12 volumes of water). The\r\ndye-liquor may be composed of 70 parts rasped Brazilwood, 3 parts\r\ntartar, and 420 parts water, boiled together, strained, and allowed to\r\nsettle clear. The grounding and dyeing are done on a table with a brush\r\nor sponge (see Glove-kid dyeing, p. 229). The odour is communicated by\r\nrubbing the flesh-side with a mixture of fish-oil and birch-bark oil,\r\nwhich sometimes contains no more than 5 per cent. of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PL. VII.\r\n\r\n_E. & F. N. Spon, London & New York_\r\n\r\n\"INK-PHOTO\" SPRAGUE & CO LONDON\r\n\r\nTREADING AND DYEING THE SKINS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nCHAMOIS OR WASH-LEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis leather, which is remarkable for its soft felty texture, which it\r\nretains even after wetting, although perfectly porous and free from\r\ngreasiness in its finished state, is prepared by the action of oil on\r\nthe raw skin. Wash-leather was formerly manufactured from sheep- and\r\ncalf-skins, and from those of the chamois, and various deer (hence the\r\nname), from which, after liming, the grain was removed (frized) with a\r\nsharp knife, either with the hair, or after unhairing. The flesh-splits\r\nof sheep-skins are now generally employed for ordinary wash-leather,\r\nand of course no such process is needed, though buff-leather for belts\r\nand military purposes is still so manufactured. The skins receive a\r\nthorough liming, which, where softness is desired, is so conducted as\r\nvery thoroughly to remove the cement-substance (coriin) from between\r\nthe fibres; and this removal is frequently carried still further by a\r\nshort bran-drench, which also secures the complete absence of lime.\r\nAfter the usual beam-work, the skins are pressed or wrung out to remove\r\nsurplus water, and while still moist are oiled on a table and folded in\r\ncushions. Fish-, seal-, or whale-oil is generally used, and vegetable\r\noils do not seem to answer even in mixture, with the exception perhaps\r\nof olive-oil. The skins are next stocked for 2-3 hours, shaken out,\r\nand hung up for 1/2-1 hour to cool and partially dry. They are then\r\nagain folded in bundles, and stocked for a short time, taken out,\r\noiled again, and returned to the stocks; and this process is repeated,\r\nuntil the skins lose their original smell of limed hide, and acquire a\r\npeculiar mustard-like odour, and the water at first present has been\r\nentirely replaced by oil. The later dryings are frequently conducted\r\nin a heated room, and when the oiling is complete, the skins are piled\r\non the floor, and the oxidation of the oil, which has already commenced\r\nduring the fullings and dryings above described, is completed by a sort\r\nof fermentation, in which the skins heat very considerably. During this\r\nprocess, they are carefully watched, and if the heat rises so high as\r\nto endanger the quality of the leather, the pile must be turned over,\r\nso as to cool the skins, and bring those which were originally outside\r\nto the centre. When the fermentation comes to an end, the skins are\r\nno longer susceptible of heating, and are of the well-known yellow or\r\nchamois colour. Where this colour is objectionable, the oxidation is\r\nsometimes completed by hanging the leather in a heated room instead\r\nof by piling. It is now necessary to remove the surplus oil, and this\r\nin France is done by oiling with any sort of oil, throwing into hot\r\nwater, and wringing or squeezing. The oil obtained in this way forms\r\nthe _moëllon_ or _dégras_ so much prized for currying purposes. The\r\nunoxidised oil still retained by the skins is removed by washing\r\nwith soda or potash lye. In England and Germany, the whole of the\r\nuncombined oil is removed in this way, and is recovered from the lye,\r\nin which it exists in a partially saponified state, by neutralisation\r\nwith sulphuric acid. It forms the \"sod\" oil of commerce. About half\r\nthe oil employed is obstinately retained by the skin, and cannot be\r\nremoved even by boiling with alkalies, while no gelatin is obtained\r\nby boiling water, to which the chamoised skin is much more resistant\r\nthan ordinary leather. The nature of the tanning process does not seem\r\nto be well understood. It is generally stated that the fibres of the\r\nskin are unaltered, but are merely coated with the oxidised products of\r\nthe oil. It is hard, however, on this hypothesis to understand their\r\nextraordinary indifference to water, even at a boiling temperature,\r\nwhich speedily converts kid and other tawed leathers into a solution\r\nwhich gelatinises on cooling; and it seems more probable to the present\r\nwriter that some actual chemical combination is formed. Lietzman\r\n('Herstellung der Leder,' p. 164) supposes that the whole of the\r\ngelatigenous tissue has been removed by liming and bating, and that\r\nonly the very indifferent yellow elastic fibres (see p. 21) remain.\r\nThis view, however, is quite untenable, in consideration of the very\r\nsmall proportion of these fibres originally present in the skin. Müntz,\r\nin his researches (see p. 17), showed that the fibres insoluble in\r\nboiling water scarcely exceeded 3 per cent, of the dried pelt. Dry\r\ngelatigenous fibre has a considerable resistance to heat, and it is\r\npossible that the action of the oil may consist in preventing the\r\nabsorption of water. This, however, will not explain its resistance to\r\nalkalies. Cotton or other vegetable fibres moistened with oil, readily\r\nundergo oxidation, with so much evolution of heat as sometimes to\r\ncause spontaneous combustion; but the oxidation products are easily\r\nand completely removed by alkaline solutions, leaving the fibre in its\r\noriginal state, as indeed is noted by Lietzman (_loc. cit._).\r\n\r\nThe finishing processes consist in staking during drying to retain\r\nsoftness, and in whitening and smoothing the flesh (or sometimes both\r\nsides) on the fluffing wheel. Skins for gloves, &c., are bleached\r\nlike linen, by sprinkling and exposure to the sun; or more rapidly by\r\ntreatment with a weak solution of potash permanganate, and subsequently\r\nwith sulphurous, or very dilute sulphuric acid, to remove the brown\r\nmanganous oxide formed (Barreswil, Dingl. Polyt. Jour., 161, 312).\r\nGaseous sulphurous acid from burning sulphur may also be used for\r\nbleaching. The \"dyeing\" of chamois leather is generally done with\r\nochres and similar colouring matters, and may be removed by washing.\r\nTreatment with egg-yolk in water, or with an emulsion of olive-oil with\r\na little soap, and rubbing, or stretching, will restore softness to\r\nchamois leather which has become stiff by washing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCROWN LEATHER, OR PRELLER'S LEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process of manufacture of this leather, which has obtained a\r\nfirm position as the most suitable material for certain classes of\r\nbelting, picker-straps, &c., was discovered about 35 years since by\r\nTheodor Klemm, a cabinet-maker in Wurtemburg and founder of the present\r\nwell-known firm of leather manufacturers, Gebrüder Klemm of Pfullingen.\r\nKlemm, at that time in poor circumstances, sold his patent in Paris to\r\nan Englishman, Preller, who started a manufacture of it in Southwark\r\nand adopted a crown as his trade-mark. Since this time the manufacture\r\nhas spread, first to Switzerland and then through Germany; but in\r\nEngland, to the writer's knowledge, it is confined to one or two firms.\r\n\r\nThe process of manufacture of crown leather is in principle\r\nintermediate between that of calf-kid (see p. 223), and the pure\r\noil-tanning, if we may call it so, of which the chamois leather (see\r\np. 210) is typical. It depends on impregnating the raw hide with a\r\nmixture of fats and albumens, to which salt or saltpetre is added to\r\nprevent putrefaction. The process as described in the original patent\r\nwas as follows,--The hides were unhaired by liming or painting (with\r\nsulphides), and cleansed as usual, no plumping lime being given. After\r\nunhairing they were allowed to dry some little time in the air till no\r\nlonger plump, and were then worked in a tumbler drum, without water,\r\ntill uniformly soft. They were then spread on a table and brushed\r\nover on the flesh-sides with a mixture of 23 parts of ox-brain, 6-1/2\r\nof butter, 28 of soft fat, and 4 of salt or saltpetre, with 26 of\r\nbarley-flour and 12-1/2 of milk, of which the leading 4 ingredients\r\nwere first to be mixed and the flour stirred in, the milk being last\r\nadded. The hides were then returned to the tumbler, which was provided\r\nwith tubular axes, through which a portion of exhaust steam was\r\nadmitted to warm the drum. After tumbling some hours, the drum was\r\nopened, and the hides were examined. If the tanning was not complete,\r\nthe hides were hung in the air for a time to dry, and the process was\r\nrepeated till a cut showed that the mixture had completely penetrated\r\nthe hide.\r\n\r\nFrom Eitner's researches it appears that the essential tanning\r\ningredients of the mixture above described are the fat (and butter\r\nwhich acts simply as fat) and the albuminous matter of the milk\r\n(casein), brains (albumen, &c.), and flour (gluten); the starch serving\r\nat most to assist in the emulsification of the fats. Eitner treated\r\ncrown leather with dilute potash solution to remove the albumen\r\nand fats, and after washing and drying obtained a material like an\r\ninsufficiently stocked chamois leather. On again stuffing with a\r\nquantity of fat equal to that removed, but without the albumen, the\r\nleather became dark and quite greasy, so that by sharp bending oil\r\ncould be pressed out. Good results may be obtained in crown leather\r\nmanufactured with fats and flour only, without the use of milk or\r\nbrains, so that it is obvious that the same purpose is served by either\r\nvegetable or animal albumenoids. The most important point in the\r\npurposes for which crown leather is employed is toughness, and this is\r\ngiven by the unaltered hide-fibres, which are merely preserved by the\r\ncoating of oily matter with which, like those of chamois leather, they\r\nare surrounded. The albumen serves the purpose of filling the spaces\r\nbetween the fibres, and giving solidity and firmness, so that the belts\r\nmay keep their shape, and not stretch inordinately. It also serves to\r\nmake the leather waterproof, and fit it for water-bags for military\r\npurposes (as it gives no taste to the water) and for hose-pipes. The\r\nalbumen, which much resembles the hide-fibres in composition, is like\r\nthem preserved by the fats.\r\n\r\nFor the modern process of manufacture, good, even and well-flayed\r\nhides are selected, and unhaired either by sweating, or by a very short\r\nliming, which must be assisted by rockers or some mechanical mode of\r\nmoving the hides, so as to get them unhaired in the shortest possible\r\ntime and with the least injury to the fibre. Sodium sulphide (see p.\r\n147) may be employed with great advantage. The fleshing and scudding\r\nare performed as usual, according to the mode of unhairing adopted. The\r\nhides are then very commonly rounded, and the bellies tanned in the\r\nusual manner; but sometimes the whole hide is made into crown leather.\r\n\r\nAs crown leather is naturally almost white, it is usual at this stage\r\nto colour the hide with bark or other liquors. As in this case simply\r\ncolouring and not tanning of the grain is required, high-coloured\r\nliquors, made by steaming materials with much colour and little tannin,\r\nare preferable. For this purpose wood extracts, such as chestnut,\r\nquebracho, or oak-wood are said to be very suitable, and beech, pine\r\nor alder bark may also be used. In practice, chestnut and hemlock\r\nextracts, and occasionally cutch are employed; but the last named is\r\nnot to be recommended. A chestnut liquor of 7-1/2° Tw. or 5° B. (34°\r\nBark.), with constant handling or in a paddle-tumbler, will give a\r\nsatisfactory colour and grain in 1-2 hours. This rapid colouring is\r\npreferable to the slower process, which occupies 24 hours in weaker\r\nliquors. If sweated, the hides are now plumped with sulphuric acid,\r\nbut only to a very moderate extent. This process is best performed\r\nin a paddle-tumbler; about 3-1/2 oz. of sulphuric acid are required\r\nper hide, and a time of 6-12 hours according to the water employed.\r\nThe liquor may be several times used, strengthened with the necessary\r\nquantity of acid. Limed hides do not require further swelling. The\r\nhides are washed through clean water, and hung up to dry somewhat.\r\n\r\nThe hides are next spread on a table, flesh-side uppermost, and\r\ncovered with a layer of the tanning paste nearly 1/4 in. thick. The\r\ncomposition of this paste may be varied according to the relative\r\nprices of different materials, and the amount of hard fats must be\r\nregulated according to whether or not appliances are provided for\r\nheating the tumbler. A good mixture is 7 parts common wheat-flour, 7 of\r\nhorse-grease, 1 of salt, and 1-2 of tallow. If too soft, more tallow\r\nmay be employed. The salt is first added to the horse-grease, then\r\nthe melted tallow, These fats are added little by little to the flour\r\ntill a uniform paste is obtained. Another good mixture is 27 parts\r\nwheat-flour, 25 of bone-grease, 4 of tallow, and 4 of salt. Another\r\nrecipe gives 28 lb. fine white flour made to a paste with 13-14 pints\r\nwater and then worked up to a uniform mass with a tepid mixture of 28\r\nlb. beef tallow and 28 lb. hard horse-fat (_Pferdekammfett_). These\r\nmixtures are all for use in warmed drums; a specimen of one used in a\r\nfactory where the mixture was simply trodden in cold into the leather\r\nin open tubs is as follows:--7 parts flour, 9·4 of horse-fat, 2·8 of\r\nfish-oil, 7 of ox-brains and 0·7 of salt. The hides are next folded in\r\nbundles and placed in the drum; or in stocks, which are occasionally\r\nused for the purpose. If a drum be used, it must be of large\r\ndiameter, 8-9 ft., provided with pegs inside, and should make about\r\n25 revolutions per minute, so as to work the hides with considerable\r\nforce. Much more care is needed in warming the drum, than is required\r\nin ordinary stuffing, and this is best accomplished by warmed damp air.\r\nThis may be arranged by the use of an air-pump, which draws air through\r\nwater warmed by exhaust steam, and forces it through the hollow axles\r\nof the drum (or drums); or a simple aspirator consisting of a cask\r\nfilled with water may be connected to one axle, so that as the water\r\nruns out it will draw air through the drum from the opposite axle,\r\nwhich is connected with a cask half filled with hot water through which\r\nair is allowed to bubble. Probably the same effect could be reached in\r\na still simpler and cheaper manner by the use of a steam-jet blower,\r\nsuch as Körting's. In any case the drum must be warmed to a temperature\r\nof 82°-104° F. (28°-40° C.). Warm dry air may also be used, but is not\r\nso suitable, as it dries the hides too much. The hides are tumbled\r\n8-12 hours, hung up till half-dry, and the process is repeated. For\r\nvery heavy hides, 4 tumblings may be required. In the later tumblings,\r\na lower temperature, 95° F. (35° C.), may be employed, and the time\r\nextended to 15 hours.\r\n\r\nThe currying of crown leather is very simple. It is set out on flesh\r\nand grain, and boarded to raise the grain. Mossner, before currying,\r\nwashes 2 hours in water and brushes with tepid soda solution (1 in\r\n60). The yield of weight is small, only amounting to about 30-40 per\r\ncent. of the raw hide employed, and hence the price per lb. must be\r\nconsiderably higher than that of tanned leather to yield a profit. The\r\nabove information is mostly drawn from articles by W. Eitner ('Der\r\nGerber,' iv. 1 _et seq._) and Franz Kathreiner ('Gerber Zeitung,' 21st\r\nDecember, 1875).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nMINERAL-TANNED LEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invention of the earliest form of mineral tanning, that with alum\r\nand salt, dates from remote antiquity; but as it is in large measure\r\nthe type of all that has been since done, it deserves examination in\r\nsome detail, at least as regards principles. In practice it is used\r\nalone in curing skins with the hair on, and for making white leather\r\nfor laces and other purposes; and, in combination with oil and albumen,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, are the tanning agents in the case of \"crown\r\nleather,\" it forms the process for producing calf and glove kids, as\r\nwill be described under those headings (pp. 223, 225).\r\n\r\nCareful researches by Reimer (Ding. Polyt. Jour., 205, p. 143 _et\r\nseq._) show (what has long been known in practice) that alum alone\r\nis not capable of making a pliable leather. The salt, nevertheless,\r\ndoes not enter into combination with the alum, or even with the hide.\r\nIts function is partially physical, increasing the diffusion of the\r\nsolution, and partially chemical, as in the presence of acids (and\r\nsalts of acid reaction) it precipitates the coriin, and prevents it\r\nfrom gluing the fibres into a horny mass as it dries. Prof. Knapp\r\nhas shown that this is the first essential in producing leather, and\r\nthat raw hide may be converted into a pliable material with all the\r\nproperties of white leather by simply withdrawing the water with\r\nalcohol, in which coriin is not soluble, and by which it is therefore\r\nprecipitated. This leather, containing when dried no added constituent,\r\nis of course at once reconverted into raw hide by soaking in water.\r\nBoth the salt and a portion of the alumina is removed from tawed\r\nleather by soaking in water, and it then dries hard and horny, and\r\nby boiling in water will yield a considerable percentage of gelatin.\r\nThe alum is not absorbed as a whole. It is a double salt (alumina and\r\npotash sulphate or alumina and ammonia sulphate), and only the alumina\r\nsulphate is absorbed, potash (or ammonia) sulphate accumulating in the\r\nliquor. The alumina salt retained by the hide, especially in presence\r\nof much salt, contains slightly more than its normal proportion of\r\nalumina to acid, or in chemical language is to some extent basic. This\r\nis caused partly by the lime remaining in the skin from the unhairing\r\nprocess, which neutralises a portion of sulphuric acid, but in part is\r\nthe result of the affinity of the hide-fibres for alumina, a certain\r\nsmall proportion of free sulphuric acid being left in the liquor. The\r\naccumulation of this and of potash sulphate is the reason why such\r\nliquors cannot be used perpetually by mere strengthening with alum, but\r\nmust be frequently renewed. The attraction of hide-fibre for alumina\r\nsulphate is so strong, that in presence of a sufficient excess of\r\nhide it may be completely removed even from dilute solutions. Alumina\r\nacetate or sulphate may be substituted for alum with equally good\r\nresults in practice, the only advantage of the latter being its easier\r\npreparation. Ferric and chromic salts and iron or chrome alum, may be\r\nsubstituted for common alum, and are absorbed in a similar manner, and\r\nin presence of common salt give equally pliable leathers, of a buff\r\nand pale greenish tint respectively. Without salt, the leathers are\r\nhard and brittle. In all these cases, the tanning agent may be to a\r\nlarge extent removed by simple washing with water. The tannage may be\r\nrendered more durable by passing the leather before drying through a\r\nweak bath of sodic carbonate or even lime-water, which precipitates the\r\nalumina, iron, or chrome in a basic form on the hide-fibres. Soap baths\r\nmay also be used, by which aluminic, ferric, or chromic stearates and\r\noleates are formed, possessing considerable toughness and resistance to\r\nwater. So far as the writer is aware, no mineral tannage has yet been\r\nproduced which will not yield gelatin when treated, first with dilute\r\nacid and then with boiling water; but this is rather a gain than\r\notherwise, as leather scraps might be utilised for glue. There seems\r\nno reason why good and durable leather, for boot-uppers and for many\r\nmechanical purposes, should not be fabricated with salts of iron and\r\nchromium in conjunction with salt. If eggs and flour were also used,\r\nproducts similar to calf-kid would be obtained. Iron-leathers may of\r\ncourse be blacked with infusions of galls or many tanning materials, or\r\nwith logwood. Ferrous salts have no tanning properties.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of using neutral iron salts, basic ferric salts (which may\r\nbe obtained by dissolving ferric oxide in solution of neutral ferric\r\nsalts, or by oxidising ferrous sulphate with manganese black oxide,\r\nor nitric acid) be employed, much larger quantities are absorbed by\r\nthe hide, and if this be fixed with soap baths and finished with a\r\nmoderate quantity of oil, a gain of weight--approaching 50 per cent.\r\nof the finished leather, or about the same as that given by bark, may\r\nbe obtained. The leather, however, has by no means the same resistance\r\nto wet and decay as bark-tanned leather, and invariably has a tendency\r\nto crack when sharply bent. The process has been most carefully worked\r\nout by Professor Knapp, and was patented and worked commercially for\r\na short time in Brunswick, but apparently without financial success.\r\nProfessor Knapp's method is as follows:--The iron solution is prepared\r\nby adding nitric acid to a boiling solution of ferrous sulphate (green\r\nvitriol) till the iron is completely oxidised to the ferric condition.\r\nTo this, ferrous sulphate is again added so long as it continues to\r\ncause effervescence. The resulting solution is a clear orange, and\r\nof more or less syrupy consistence, and may be evaporated without\r\ndecomposition or crystallisation to a transparent varnish. The hides\r\nare unhaired and prepared for tanning in the usual way, and are then\r\nhandled in solutions of the iron salt, which are at first weak, and\r\nare gradually strengthened. Skins are tanned in 2-3 days, and the\r\nheaviest hides in a week. After tanning, the hides are stuffed in a\r\ndrum ventilated through the axes, very similar to that described\r\nunder \"crown leather,\" p. 213, with an insoluble iron-soap made by\r\nprecipitating soap solution with the iron-liquor; or the iron-soaps may\r\nbe formed in the hide by the alternate use of iron and soap solutions,\r\nas already described. The leather is finally saturated with a solution\r\nof stearin and paraffin, to render it waterproof.\r\n\r\nA process which has been worked on a larger scale, is that of Dr.\r\nHeinzerling, introduced about 1878, with the usual promise of \"complete\r\nrevolution\" in the leather trade; but which, in spite of the most\r\ndetermined and persevering efforts of the Eglinton Chemical Company,\r\nwho own the English patent, has failed to take any very prominent\r\nposition in commerce. The tanning materials employed are alum and salt,\r\nwith a varying proportion of potash, soda, or magnesia bichromate.\r\nThese salts have a very marked hardening effect on animal tissues, and,\r\nwhen mixed with gelatin and exposed to light or acted on by acids,\r\nbecome reduced, and at the same time render the gelatin insoluble even\r\nin hot water, a property which is made useful in many photographic\r\nprocesses. This is probably due to the formation of salts of chromium,\r\nwhich, as has been stated (p. 219) have a similar tanning effect, but\r\nperhaps more powerful, than those of alumina. However this may be, the\r\neffect of potash bichromate when exposed to light with gelatin, differs\r\nfrom that of the addition of chrome salts ready formed, the gelatin in\r\nthe first case becoming incapable of even swelling in hot water, while\r\nin the second, though rendered insoluble, it becomes soft and swollen.\r\nThe use of potash bichromate in tanning had been previously patented by\r\nCavalin, who used it in conjunction with alum and salt, and with the\r\naddition of a portion of green vitriol, to give the leather a colour\r\nmore similar to that of bark-tanned.\r\n\r\nDr. Heinzerling uses metallic zinc in the salt and alum solution to\r\nassist in the precipitation of amorphous alumina on the hide-fibres.\r\nThe same material was used in a similar way by Jennings (No. 2295,\r\n1861), but with the object of whitening the goods. Yellow or red\r\nprussiates of potash (potassic ferrocyanide or ferricyanide), are also\r\nsometimes mixed with the solution, in order to enable the leather to\r\nbe blacked with iron-liquor, with which they produce prussian blue. To\r\nfix the tannage on the fibre, and prevent its washing out, the use of\r\nbarium chloride, lead acetate, and of soap solution is claimed; the\r\nlatter having been also patented for similar purposes by Knapp, and\r\nsubsequently by Jennings and others.\r\n\r\nIn order to render the leather waterproof, it is finally saturated with\r\nsolutions of paraffin, stearin, and other fats and hydrocarbons (resin\r\nis employed, though not named in the patent), in petroleum spirit and\r\nsimilar solvents.\r\n\r\nSuch is the original patent, which, it will be seen, is rather a\r\ncombination of older processes than an original discovery. Whether\r\nit is still worked on the same lines the writer is unable to say,\r\nbut he is aware that considerable improvements have been made in\r\nthe finish and appearance of the goods. The leather in its present\r\nform possesses considerable resistance to water, is free from the\r\nbrittleness so common in mineral tannages, and like other alumed\r\nleathers, considerably exceeds bark-tanned leather in toughness and\r\nelasticity. These make it valuable for many purposes, and among others,\r\nfor machine-belting, although it has the disadvantage of elongating\r\nconsiderably while in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nCALF-KID.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalf-kid is used for light upper-leather, and belongs to a different\r\nclass from any yet described, being \"tawed\" instead of tanned. In this\r\nrespect, and in most details of its manufacture, it resembles glove-kid.\r\n\r\nThe process is as follows. Selected calf-skins, dried or salted, are\r\nthe raw material, and after a suitable softening in fresh water, are\r\nlimed for 2-3 weeks, or till the hair goes easily. They are then\r\nunhaired and fleshed in the usual manner, pured with a bate of dogs'\r\ndung, scudded, and again cleansed with a bran drench. In Germany, the\r\nbran drench is used alone, and is composed of 33 lb. bran to 100 medium\r\nskins. Before use, the bran should, especially in summer, be well\r\nwashed, to free it from adhering meal. The temperature of the drench\r\nshould not exceed 100° F. (38° C.), and the skins should remain in for\r\n8-10 hours. Lactic acid is produced by fermentation; this removes lime,\r\nand is itself neutralised by the products of putrid fermentation which\r\nsucceeds it.\r\n\r\nThe tanning is accomplished in a drum with a mixture of alum and salt;\r\nand after drying, the skins are again moistened, and worked in the\r\ndrum with a mixture of oil, flour, and egg-yolk. In the German method,\r\nthese two operations are combined. Eitner, who has written a series of\r\narticles on the process, gives 40 lb. flour, 20 lb. alum, 9 lb. salt,\r\n250 eggs, or about 1-1/3 gal. of egg-yolk, 7/8 pint (1/2 litre) of\r\nolive-oil, and 12-16 gal. water, as a suitable mixture. The skins are\r\nworked in a drum-tumbler (preferably a square one, see Plate 5) for 20\r\nminutes, then allowed to rest 10 minutes, and this process is twice\r\nrepeated. The temperature must not exceed 100° F. (38° C.), and it is\r\nsaid to be important that the drum should be ventilated by holes at\r\nthe axis.\r\n\r\nThe skins are allowed to drain, are then rapidly dried at a temperature\r\nof 140°-160° F. (60°-71° C.), and, after \"samming,\" or damping with\r\ncold water, are staked by drawing them to and fro over a blunt knife\r\nfixed on the top of a post (see Plate 6). They are then wetted down and\r\nshaved, either with the moon-knife or ordinary curriers' shaving-knife,\r\nand sometimes receive a second dressing of oil, flour, and egg, to\r\nsoften them still further.\r\n\r\nDyeing black is accomplished either by brushing on a table, or by\r\n\"ridging\" or folding, grain-side outwards, and drawing quickly through\r\nbaths of the mordant and colour. To prepare them for the colour,\r\nstale urine is generally employed. A deeper colour, and one less\r\nliable to strike through the skin, is obtained by adding 1/4 lb.\r\npotash bichromate to 4 gal. of urine, or the following mixture may be\r\nsubstituted with advantage, viz. 1/2 lb. Marseilles soap dissolved in\r\nboiling water, 5 or 6 egg-yolks added, and the whole made up to 4 gal.\r\nwith water and 1/4 lb. potash bichromate. The colour used is infusion\r\nof logwood or its extract, or two-thirds logwood, which is best\r\nextracted by stale urine or old soak-liquor, with addition of a small\r\nquantity of soda (1 lb. to 25 lb. dye-wood). It is fixed and darkened\r\nby a wash of iron-liquor (1 of iron protosulphate in 75 of cold water).\r\nAfter being again dried, the skins are grounded with the moon-knife,\r\nand rubbed over on the grain with a composition containing oil, wax,\r\n&c., and are finally ironed with a flat-iron, to give them a fine and\r\nsmooth surface. Eitner gives a recipe for the gloss:--1 lb. gum arabic,\r\n1/2 lb. yellow wax, 1/2 lb. beef-tallow, 3/4 lb. Marseilles soap, 2\r\nlb. strong logwood infusion, and 1 gal. water. The water is brought to\r\na boil in an earthen pot, and then the soap, wax, gum, and tallow are\r\nadded successively, each being stirred till dissolved before adding the\r\nnext, and lastly the logwood. After boiling for an hour, it is allowed\r\nto completely cool, being incessantly stirred during the whole process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nGLOVE-KID.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis branch of leather manufacture is mainly carried on in Germany,\r\nAustria, and France. In Germany and Austria, lamb-skins are principally\r\nemployed; in France, kid-skins. For fine gloves, the skins of very\r\nyoung animals only can be used. The ordinary style of manufacture is as\r\nfollows:--The soaking of the dried skins is effected in large wooden\r\ntubs (_Kufen_, _Bottichen_), and occupies on the average 3-4 days,\r\naccording to the character of the soak-water, the size of the skins,\r\nand the time they have been stored. The skins, when thoroughly and\r\nuniformly softened, are unhaired, either by painting the flesh-side\r\nwith a thin paste of lime, or in lime-pits. In unhairing by painting\r\n(_Schwöden_), the skins, after coating the flesh-side with lime, are\r\nfolded together, so that the lime comes as little as possible into\r\ncontact with the wool, and these bundles or \"cushions\" are placed in\r\na tub, in which they are most frequently covered with water. After\r\nunhairing on the beam with a blunt knife, the skins must be limed for\r\nsome days, in order that the leather may stretch well, a quality which\r\nthe Germans denominate _Zug_. By this method of unhairing, the wool\r\nis preserved uninjured, but it is not suitable for the finer sorts\r\nof leather. The unhairing in lime-pits is done either with gas-lime\r\n(Grünkalk), or, as is now almost exclusively the practice, with the\r\nso-called \"poison-limes\" (_Giftäscher_). These are prepared by mixing\r\nred arsenic (arsenic sulphide) with lime, while it is being slaked, and\r\nis at its hottest. The calcic sulphydrate (and perhaps sulpharsenite)\r\nthus formed hastens the unhairing, and gives the grain a higher gloss.\r\nWell-conducted establishments now avoid as much as possible the use of\r\nold limes, which produce a loose, porous leather, with a rough, dull\r\ngrain. The liming lasts on the average 10 days, and is of the greatest\r\nimportance. It is essential that the interfibrillary substance shall\r\nbe dissolved, that the leather may have the quality known as _Stand_,\r\nthat is to say, may be strongly stretched in either length or breadth\r\nwithout springing back. It also depends upon the liming (and this is of\r\nspecial importance in the case of lamb-skins), whether the tissue of\r\nthe fat-glands is well loosened, so that the fat, either as such, or as\r\nlime- or ammonia-soap, may be readily and completely worked out. Skins\r\nin which this is neglected can never be properly dyed.\r\n\r\nWhen the hair (or wool) is well loosened, the skins are rinsed in\r\nwater, and then unhaired on the beam with a blunt knife. The water\r\nemployed in washing should not be much colder than the limes, or it\r\nwill prevent the hair from coming away readily. The wool or hair is\r\nwashed and dried for sale. The skins are thrown into water, to which a\r\nlittle lime-liquor has been added, to prevent precipitation of the lime\r\nin the skins by the free carbonic acid of the water, which would have\r\nthe effect of making them rough-grained.\r\n\r\nNext comes the first fleshing (_Vergleichen_) or \"levelling.\" By this,\r\nthe loose cellular tissue on the flesh-side is removed, together\r\nwith the head, ears, and shanks, and the flanks are trimmed. The\r\nskins are then again thrown into water, softened with lime-liquor as\r\nabove described, and then into a bate of dogs' dung. This is prepared\r\nby stirring up white and putrid dogs' dung with boiling water, and\r\nstraining it through a sieve or wicker basket. The bate must be used\r\ntepid, and not too strong. The skins \"fall\" (lose their plumpness) in\r\nit rapidly, and become extremely soft and fine to the touch; and the\r\nfat-glands, remaining hairs, and other dirt, can now be very readily\r\nscudded out. So far no completely satisfactory substitute has been\r\nfound for this somewhat disgusting mixture, but it has been noted that\r\nguano will produce similar effects. With regard to the mode of action\r\nof the dung bate, much has been speculated without proof, and exact\r\nanalytical evidence is wanting; but, no doubt, a weak putrefactive\r\naction goes on, as may be deduced from the presence of _bacteria_;\r\nfurther, the ammonia and weak organic acids present in the putrefying\r\ndung are capable of acting on fat and lime; and finally, a direct\r\nmechanical effect seems to be produced, difficult to describe, but\r\nfavourable to the succeeding manipulation. Too strong bates, or too\r\nlong continuance in them, produces evident putrefactive effects on the\r\nskins. (See also p. 184.)\r\n\r\nWhen the skins come out of the bate, they are stretched and worked\r\n(_abgezogen_) on the flesh with a sharp knife, and any remaining\r\nsubcutaneous tissue is removed. This constitutes the second\r\nfleshing. They are then rinsed in warm water, and beaten with clubs\r\n(_Stoss-keule_), see Plates 3 and 4, in a tub, or worked in a\r\ntumbler-drum (_Walkfass_), in either case with a very little water\r\nonly; and finally brought into a tank of water, not too cold, and kept\r\nin constant motion with a paddle-wheel.\r\n\r\nThe skins are next cleansed on the grain-side by working on the beam\r\nwith plates of vulcanite with wooden handles, so as to remove fat,\r\nlime- and ammonia-soaps, and other lime compounds, together with all\r\nremaining hair or wool. The skins are now a second time washed in the\r\n\"paddle-tumbler,\" first in cold, and then in tepid water; and after\r\nallowing the water to drain from them, they are transferred to the bran\r\ndrench.\r\n\r\nThis is prepared by soaking wheaten bran in cold water, diluting with\r\nwarm water, and straining the extract through a fine hair-sieve.\r\nSufficient of the liquid must be employed to well cover the skins, and\r\nthe temperature may range from 50° F. (10° C.) to 68° F. (20° C.).\r\nThese conditions are favourable to bacterial activity, which comes\r\ninto play, and, on the one hand, evolves formic, acetic, lactic, and\r\nbutyric acids, which dissolve any remaining traces of lime, and on the\r\nother, loosens and differentiates the hide tissue, so as to fit it\r\nto absorb the tawing solution (_Gare_). Much care is required in the\r\nmanagement of the bran drench, especially in summer, since the lactic\r\nreadily passes into the butyric fermentation (see also p. 186). The\r\ntawing mixture is composed (like that employed in the fabrication of\r\ncalf-kid, q. v.) of alum, salt, flour, and egg-yolks, in a quite thin\r\npaste. The skins are either trodden in it with the feet, or put into\r\na tumbler-drum with it (Fig. 48). Kathreiner pointed out, some years\r\nsince (in vol. i. of 'Der Gerber'), that a mixture of olive-oil and\r\nglycerine might be partially substituted for the egg-yolks, in both the\r\ntanning and dyeing of glove-kid leather.\r\n\r\nThe tawed skins are now dried by hanging on poles, grain inwards.\r\nRapid drying in well-ventilated, but only moderately-heated, rooms is\r\nessential to the manufacture of a satisfactory product.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60.]\r\n\r\nThe dry leather is rapidly passed through tepid water, and after being\r\nhung for a very short time, to allow the water to drain off, is trodden\r\ntightly into chests, and allowed to remain in them for about 12 hours,\r\nso that the moisture may be uniformly distributed. It is then trodden\r\non hurdles (_Horden_), composed of square bars of wood, joined corner\r\nto corner, so as to make a floor of sharply angular ridges, Fig. 59.\r\nThe next operation is stretching over a circular knife, called the\r\n_Stollmond_ (_stollen_, Eng. \"staking\"), shown in Fig. 60; then the\r\nleather is dried nearly completely, and staked again.\r\n\r\n\r\nDyeing.\r\n\r\nThe dyeing of glove-kids is done in 2 ways:--_a._ The skins are plunged\r\ninto the dye-bath (_Tunkfarben_). In this way, all light colours are\r\nordinarily produced, such as _gris-perle_ (pearl-grey), _paillé_\r\n(straw-yellow), _chamois_ (reddish yellow), silver-grey, aquamarine,\r\n&c. _b._ The skins are spread on an inclined or rounded table of stone\r\nor metal, and brushed over, on the grain side, first with a mordant\r\n(_Beize_), then with the dye-liquor, and lastly, with a solution of\r\na mineral salt (Plate 7). The mordant serves to fix the colour on\r\nthe surface of the skin, to prevent its striking through, to produce\r\ncertain modifications of colour, and to enable any parts of the skin\r\nwhich yet contain fat to take the colour evenly with the rest. To\r\nsatisfy these conditions, the composition of the mordants is very\r\nvaried. Potash bichromate, ammonia, potash, soda, and stale urine are\r\namong the most frequently employed, seldom separately, but usually in a\r\nmixture containing 2 or more.\r\n\r\nDye-stuffs of vegetable origin have always held the first place. Those\r\nmost in use are logwood (_Blauholz_), Brazilwood (_Rothholz_), the two\r\nfustics--_Cuba Gelbholz_ (_Morus tinctoria_) and _Ungarisches Gelbholz_\r\n(_Rhus cotinus_), several species of willow-bark and of berries,\r\nindigo-carmine, and indigo dissolved in sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nAniline colours used alone remained in fashion for a short time only,\r\nbut are now usefully employed as top-colours (_Ueberfarben_), viz.\r\nbrushed in very dilute solution over vegetable colours. In this way,\r\nparticularly tasteful shades of green, violet, and marine-blue may be\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nAfter the mordant has been applied once or twice, and the colour\r\n3-6 times, a wash (_Ueberstrich_) containing some metallic salt is\r\ngenerally applied, with the object either of bringing out the special\r\ntone required, or of making the colour more lively and permanent.\r\nThe so-called \"vitriols\" are mostly employed: \"white vitriol\" (zinc\r\nsulphate), \"blue vitriol\" (copper sulphate), \"green vitriol\" (iron\r\nsulphate), and occasionally other salts.\r\n\r\nBefore dyeing, the greater part of the flour, salt, and alum must\r\nbe removed from the skins by washing with tepid water; and they\r\ntherefore require a second feeding (_Nahrung_) of egg-yolk and salt.\r\nIn the case of the skins which are dyed by plunging into the dye-vat\r\n(_Tunkfarben_), this is done after the dyeing is completed; in that of\r\nbrush-dyeing, before the dyeing process.\r\n\r\nAfter the dyeing, the skins, if dipped, are wrung out; if brush-dyed,\r\nsleeked out with a brass plate, to get rid of superfluous water. They\r\nare then dried in an airy room. Before staking (stretching), the skins\r\nare laid or hung in a damp cellar, or in moist saw-dust. They are\r\nstaked twice: once damp, and once nearly dry.\r\n\r\nSkins which are much damaged on the grain, or otherwise faulty, are\r\nsmoothed with lump pumice on the flesh-side, either by hand or machine.\r\nThey are then dyed on this side, mostly by dipping, but occasionally\r\nwith the brush, in which case, the method described is slightly\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\nIndebtedness is acknowledged to F. Kathreiner, of Worms, and David\r\nRichardson, of Newcastle, for much information on the production of\r\nlight leathers.

Perhaps, however, the first consideration of all\r\nis the water supply, since for manufacturing purposes town water is\r\ngenerally very expensive. With regard to quality and impurities of\r\nwater, information may be found on p. 83; but, as a general rule, the\r\nsofter and purer the supply the better. It is also of great advantage\r\nwhen the source is at such a level as to flow into the tan-yard, or\r\nat least into the beam-house, without pumping. Filtration too, when\r\nneeded, is much facilitated by a sufficient head of water.\r\n\r\nOf scarcely less importance than the water supply is the drainage of\r\nthe yard. It not unfrequently happens that tanneries are prohibited\r\nfrom discharging their refuse liquors, limes, and soaks into rivers\r\nand watercourses, and it is sometimes a matter of extreme difficulty\r\nto find any other way of getting rid of them. In default of an outlet,\r\nrecourse must be had to precipitation and filtration, but this is a\r\ncostly expedient, and in fixing a site for a new yard it is far better\r\nto provide against such a possible contingency. Should, however, such\r\nmeans become necessary, it may be borne in mind that limes and liquors\r\nin great measure mutually precipitate each other, and that if all the\r\nvarious refuse is run into one tank, mixed, and settled, much is\r\naccomplished in the direction of purification. The further treatment of\r\nthe effluent water must be determined by its nature and composition.\r\n\r\nThe site chosen, the next question is the arrangement of the buildings.\r\nIt is very doubtful, where ground is not inordinately expensive,\r\nwhether it is wise to erect drying-sheds over the pits. In case of\r\nfire, very serious damage is done to liquor and leather by the heat\r\nand burning timber. If the turret form of drier be decided on, strong\r\nfoundations are required, and the ground-floor or basement is occupied\r\nwith heating apparatus; and, on the other hand, the tan-house may\r\nbe easily and cheaply covered with slated roofs, with sections of\r\nglass, to the north, if possible, like a weaving-shed, through which\r\nsufficient light for convenient work and cleanliness is admitted. The\r\ndirect rays of the sun should be avoided, but in the writer's opinion\r\nthe balance of advantage is largely in favour of a liberal supply of\r\nlight. Iron roofs are unsuitable, since the moisture condenses on, and\r\nrusts them; and particles of oxide fall into the liquors, and cause\r\niron-stains.\r\n\r\nGood ventilation along the ridge of the roof should be provided,\r\nwherever there is any steam or hot liquor used; or the condensed\r\nmoisture soon leads to decay.\r\n\r\nAs regards the general plan of the buildings, much depends on local\r\ncircumstances; but as far as possible, they must be so arranged that\r\nthe hides and leather work straight forward from one department to\r\nanother with as little wheeling or carrying as possible; that the\r\nbuildings where power is used be near to the engine, so as to avoid\r\nlong transmissions, which are very wasteful of power; and that the\r\ndifferent buildings be so isolated as to diminish the risk of the whole\r\nbeing destroyed in case of fire.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first of these conditions, if the various soaks,\r\nlimes, bates, and handlers are well arranged, it is hardly necessary\r\nto do more than draw the goods from one pit into the next throughout\r\nthe whole of the process. To, and from the layers, the goods must\r\ngenerally be carried or wheeled. In the sheds, if it be a sole-leather\r\ntannery, the butts should first come into turrets or open sheds for\r\nthe rough drying; then into a room sheltered from draughts to temper\r\nfor striking. The striking machines or beams should be in an adjoining\r\nroom, or immediately below; then a small shed-space for drying before\r\nrolling; next the roller room; and then the warm stove for drying\r\noff. If two of these can be provided to be used alternately, it will\r\nallow the goods to be aired off without taking down, and they may then\r\nbe immediately handed or lowered into the warehouse, without fear of\r\nover-drying, which is sometimes difficult to avoid where leather must\r\nbe taken direct out of the hot drying-room.\r\n\r\nTo fulfil the second condition named, the engine should be at the\r\ncentre of the main range of buildings, with perhaps the grinding\r\nmachinery on one side, and the leather-finishing on the other; but\r\nthis would be rather contrary to the third requirement. A very good\r\nplan would be to have the engine-house in the centre as suggested, but\r\nseparated from the buildings on each side by brick gables; and with the\r\nboiler-house behind it, and under a separate roof, say of corrugated\r\niron. Figs. 61, 62, from Eitner's book on American Tanning, show the\r\narrangement of a sole-leather tannery in the United States. If it be\r\nimpossible to have the engine near its work, it is in most cases better\r\nto employ a separate high-pressure engine, which may be within a glass\r\npartition, and will work all day with scarcely any attention. The loss\r\nof power in carrying steam for moderate distances through sufficiently\r\nlarge and well-clothed pipes is much smaller than that of long lines\r\nof shafting. The writer has known cases where fully half the indicated\r\npower of the engine was consumed in friction of the engine, shafting,\r\nand belts. High-pressure engines are as a rule to be preferred to\r\ncondensing for tannery use, since the waste steam can generally be\r\nemployed for heating, and both the first cost and that of maintenance\r\nare smaller. Where much fuel is used, it is quite worth while to have\r\nthe cylinders indicated occasionally, both running light, and driving\r\nthe machinery; much information is gained in this way as to the power\r\nspent on the various machines, and very frequently large economy is\r\neffected by proper adjustment of the valves. To work economically, an\r\nengine should be of ample power for all it has to do; and adjusted to\r\nits work, not by lowering the pressure of steam, or by checking it\r\nat the throttle-valve, but by setting the slide-valves to cut off as\r\nearly in the stroke as may be. As to how early this is possible, an\r\nindicator-diagram will at once give information. In arranging shafting,\r\nmoderate speeds, say 100-150 rev. per min., should be chosen for main\r\nlines, and when higher speeds are necessary, they should be got up by\r\nlight and well-balanced counter-shafts, with wrought-iron pulleys. In\r\ncalculating speeds, it must be remembered that they vary inversely as\r\nthe size of the pulleys. Thus a 3 ft. pulley running at 100 rev., will\r\ndrive a 2 ft. one at 150 rev., and a 12 in. one at 300. Of course the\r\nhigher its speed, the more power any shaft will transmit, but increased\r\nfriction and wear and tear soon limit this advantage. The velocity\r\nof a belt in feet per min. is obtained by multiplying the number of\r\nrevolutions per minute by the girth of the pulley in feet or by its\r\ndiameter multiplied by 3-1/7, or more accurately, 3·1416.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62.]\r\n\r\nPulleys should always be of ample breadth for the power they have to\r\ntransmit; and it is more economical both in power and cost, to use\r\nbroad single belting than the same strength in double. If the pulley\r\nwill not take a belt broad enough for the work it has to do, a second\r\nbelt may be made to run on the top of the first, and will do its share\r\nof the work. Belts should be washed occasionally with soap and tepid\r\nwater, and oiled with cod-oil; but if of sufficient breadth, should\r\nnot require the use of rosin, or adhesive materials, to make them grip\r\nthe pulley. Makers of machines often err in constructing their driving\r\npulleys too small both in breadth and diameter.\r\n\r\nThe horse-power which a belt is capable of transmitting obviously\r\nvaries extremely with circumstances, but may be approximately\r\ncalculated by the formula\r\n\r\n  (_a_ · _v_)/66000,\r\n\r\nwhere _a_ is the area of contact of the belt with the smallest pulley,\r\nand _v_ its velocity in feet per minute. Another rule is, that at a\r\nvelocity of 1000 ft. per min. each inch of breadth of belt should\r\ntransmit 2-1/2 horse-power on metal pulleys, or 5 on wooden ones,\r\non which the adhesion is greater. Adhesion may also be increased\r\nby covering the pulleys with leather or india-rubber. Both rules\r\nassume that the belt is of ample strength. One horse-power would be\r\ntransmitted by a belt running 1000 ft. per min. with a pull of 33 lb. A\r\ngood single belt should not break with a much less strain than 1000 lb.\r\nper inch of breadth, and should stand about 1/10 as much as a working\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nCountershafting and high-speed machinery, such as disintegrators,\r\nstriking machines of the Priestman type, &c., should run without\r\nmaterial jar or vibration. If this occurs, it is generally a sign that\r\nthe running part is not equally balanced. In this case, the shaft must\r\nbe taken out of its bearings, and supported on two exactly horizontal\r\nstraight-edges, when it will roll till the heaviest part is downwards;\r\nand weight must be taken off or added till it will lie in any position.\r\nIn this way, the writer had recently to add fully 2 lb. of iron to the\r\ndrum of a striking machine before equilibrium was secured, and a most\r\ntroublesome vibration prevented. Of course all machinery should be\r\nsupported as solidly as possible; and if circumstances permit, most\r\nmachines are better on a ground-floor. In placing bark mills, however,\r\nit is frequently convenient to fix them in the top of a building, so\r\nthat the ground material may be sent down shoots by its own weight to\r\nthe required places. An alternative plan is to set the mill on the\r\nground-floor, and to raise the ground material with a bucket-elevator.\r\nThis may be done successfully by letting the material fall directly\r\nfrom the mill into the buckets; but otherwise it must be thrown in\r\nwith a shovel, as buckets will not pick up ground bark, even from\r\na hopper; and in any case such elevators are often troublesome. In\r\na grinding plant designed by the writer, the unground material is\r\nfilled on the basement floor into an iron barrow, which may be wheeled\r\ninto an iron bow working between upright guide-rails. On pulling a\r\nbrake-line, the barrow is raised to the top of the building, and its\r\ncontents are tipped into a large hopper, after which the barrow rights\r\nitself, and descends for another load. In the bottom of the hopper is a\r\nsliding shover, which forces the material on to vibrating screens, by\r\nwhich it is guided either into a disintegrator, or crusher rolls, at\r\npleasure. Both these discharge through iron spouts into large hoppers\r\non the outside of a brick gable, from which, powdery materials like\r\nmyrabolanes and valonia, can be run direct into barrows or trucks.\r\nIt is very desirable that such hoppers should be separated from the\r\nmain building by a fireproof partition. The writer is glad to say, he\r\ndoes not know of a case of fire from disintegrators grinding tanning\r\nmaterials, but he is informed that a Carter's disintegrator employed in\r\ngrinding bones in a manure works has repeatedly set fire to the flannel\r\nbag into which the dust was allowed to escape. If this were to occur\r\nwith a dry and dusty tanning material, it is not unlikely that it might\r\nresult in an explosion such as sometimes happens in flour-mills from\r\na similar cause. On the whole, however, mills of the coffee-mill type\r\nare probably more dangerous than disintegrators; since if they become\r\npartially choked, the heat caused by friction is very great.\r\n\r\nFor lubricating purposes, mineral oils of high density are not more\r\ndangerous than animal or vegetable, but rather the reverse; as, though\r\nthey are possibly more inflammable, their mixture with cotton-waste\r\nand other porous vegetable materials is not spontaneously combustible,\r\nwhile vegetable and animal oils occasionally are. Heavy mineral oils\r\nshould always be used as cylinder oils in high-pressure engines, in\r\npreference to other oils or tallow, since they are not decomposed\r\nby steam, and do no harm if blown into the feed-water, but serve to\r\nloosen and prevent scale and deposit. Ordinary oils and tallow, on the\r\nother hand, when submitted to the action of high-pressure steam, are\r\nseparated into glycerin and fatty acids (see p. 60), and the latter\r\ncorrode the valve faces and seatings, and in combination with temporary\r\nhardness in the boilers form a very dangerous porous deposit, which\r\noften leads to overheating of the tubes.\r\n\r\nNext to the machinery, the pits demand special consideration. The\r\nchapter on the subject in Mr. Schultz's book on 'Leather Manufacture,'\r\nis well worth attentive study as giving American practice on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned method of sinking pits is to make them of wood, and\r\ncarefully puddle them round with clay, which should be well worked\r\nup before use. Such pits, if made of good pine and kept in constant\r\nuse, are very durable, some of the original pits at Lowlights Tannery,\r\nconstructed in 1765, being still in use. Loam mixed with water to the\r\nconsistence of thin mortar may also be employed, the pits being filled\r\nup with water, to keep them steady, at the same rate as the loam is run\r\nin. Probably the best materials for pit-sides are the large Yorkshire\r\nflagstones. Where these are not attainable, very durable pits may be\r\nmade of brick, either built with Lias lime, and pointed with Portland\r\ncement, or built entirely with the latter. Common lime cannot be used,\r\nas it spoils both liquors and leather; and even cements with too large\r\na percentage of lime are unsatisfactory. Brick and common mortar are,\r\nhowever, suitable for lime-pits.\r\n\r\nThe writer has constructed wooden pits in two ways. In the one case,\r\nafter making the excavation, beams were laid in a well-puddled bed of\r\nclay; on these a floor of strong tongued and grooved deals was laid,\r\nand on this the pits were constructed of similar wood to the floor, and\r\npuddled round with clay. In the second case the pits were built like\r\nlarge boxes above ground, and when finished, lowered on to a bed of\r\nclay prepared for them, and then puddled both around and between. It\r\nmay have been from defective workmanship in the first case, but those\r\nmade on the last-named plan, which is that adopted from very early\r\ntimes, have certainly proved the tightest and most satisfactory. Mr.\r\nSchultz describes a plan as the Buffalo method, in which a floor is\r\nlaid as just described, and grooves cut with a plane for the reception\r\nof the sides, which are formed of perpendicular planks, each end and\r\nside being finally tightened up by the insertion of a \"wedge plank.\"\r\n\r\nIf bricks be used, great care must be taken that the cement is not\r\nmerely laid so as to fill the joints towards the two surfaces of the\r\nwall, as is the habit of modern bricklayers, but actually floated into\r\nall the joints so as to make the wall a solid mass; or leaks can hardly\r\nbe avoided. Cement pits are very good, and, though not particularly\r\ncheap in material, which must be of the best, are readily made by\r\nintelligent labourers under good supervision. The first step is to lay\r\na level floor of good concrete, in which glazed pipes for emptying\r\nthe pits may be embedded; care being also taken that all joints in\r\nthese are thoroughly tight, since future repairs are impossible. The\r\nnext step is to make frames, the exact length and breadth of the pits\r\nrequired, and perhaps 15 in. deep. These are arranged on the floor\r\nwhere the pits are to be, and the intervening spaces are filled with\r\nconcrete of perhaps 1 of cement to 3 or 4 of crushed stone or brick.\r\nRough stones and bricks may also be bedded in the concrete as the work\r\ngoes on, to help to fill up. After the first layer has set, the frames\r\nmay be raised and a second added, and so on. The work is generally\r\nfinished by floating over it, while still damp, a little pure cement,\r\nto give a smooth surface. Before using, the cement should be tried\r\non a small scale, to be sure that it does not discolour leather or\r\nliquors, and the pits should always be seasoned with old or cheap\r\nliquor before actual use.\r\n\r\nIf possible, both latches and handler-pits should be provided with\r\nplugs and underground pipes, communicating with a liquor-well some\r\nfeet below their levels. Glazed fire-clay is very suitable both for\r\npipes and plug-holes, which should be in the pit corners. Some means\r\nshould also be provided for the ready clearing of the pipes when choked\r\nwith tanning materials. A good plan is to let each line of pipes end\r\nin a liquor-well large enough for a man to go down. As it is almost\r\nimpossible to make plugs fit without occasional leakage, it is not\r\nwell to run pits with very different strengths of liquors to one well,\r\nbut the layers, handlers, and different sets of leaches should each\r\nhave their own, so as to avoid mixture. A good means of clearing pipes\r\nconsists in a series of iron rods 3-4 ft. long, connected by hooks\r\nfitting into double eyes, as shown in Fig. 63. It is obvious that in a\r\nnarrow pipe or drain, these cannot become disconnected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63.]\r\n\r\nIt is, as Schultz points out, of questionable advantage to lay wooden\r\ntroughs for supplying liquor to each pit under the alleys, since it is\r\nalmost impossible to preserve them from decay; but the same objection\r\nwould not apply to glazed pipes, well clayed or cemented. A very good\r\nand cheap plan in practice, is to let the liquor-pump, or a raised\r\nliquor-cistern, discharge into a large and quite horizontal trough\r\nraised 5 or 6 feet above the level of the yard, and provided with\r\nplug-holes at intervals, under which short troughs may be set to run\r\nthe liquor into the various pits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PL. VIII.\r\n\r\n_E. & F. N. Spon, London & New York._\r\n\r\n\"INK-PHOTO.\" SPRAGUE & CO. LONDON.\r\n\r\nRUBBING-DOWN DYED SKINS.]\r\n\r\nIn tan-yard construction, iron should, as far as possible, be avoided\r\nwherever it can come into contact with liquor, as it discolours the\r\nleather. In default of underground pipes, india-rubber suction hose\r\nmay be employed. Direct-acting steam pumps without fly-wheels are not\r\nsuitable for tanneries, as they \"hammer\" when the pit is nearly sucked\r\nup. Steam-jet elevators and the pulsometer are very useful for some\r\npurposes, but slightly warm, and dilute the liquors with condensed\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64.]\r\n\r\nMuch that has been said about pits applies also to leaches. They may\r\nbe constructed either of wood, or brick and cement, and where heat is\r\nemployed the latter is the better. They are also to be provided with\r\nplugs and pipes leading to a liquor-well. About 6 in. from the bottom\r\nof the pit is a false bottom B made of boards, perforated with holes\r\nor set a little distance apart; and in the corner is an \"eye\" C (Ger.\r\n_Pfaff_) consisting of 2 boards set at right angles, so as to preserve\r\na vertical channel communicating with the space under the false bottom.\r\nThis serves, in pits provided with pipes, for the insertion of the\r\nplug; and where this is absent, for that of a suction hose to pump\r\noff the liquor. In the American Press-leck System, the eye of one\r\npit communicates by a horizontal spout with the top of the next (see\r\nD, Fig. 64). The Allen and Warren Sprinkler Leck (Fig. 65) has very\r\nmuch superseded this arrangement in America, though it is doubtful\r\nif it spends the bark so completely. The round tubs, however, have\r\nseveral advantages and may well be used for many purposes in English\r\nyards. Their construction is described in some detail in Mr. Schultz's\r\nbook above cited. Some details will also be found on p. 209 of the\r\n'Manufacture of Leather' by Davis. The rule for finding the capacity\r\nof a round tub with perpendicular sides in cubic feet is to square the\r\ndiameter and multiply by ·7854, and by the depth in feet; or roughly,\r\nto square half the diameter and multiply by the depth and by 3-1/7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65.]\r\n\r\nLeaches and liquors are generally heated by blowing in steam direct. In\r\nthis case, the condensed water mixes with the liquor, and in heating\r\na liquor to boiling point it may be taken that about 20 per cent. of\r\nwater will be thus added. Where strong liquors are to be heated, it\r\nis therefore obviously much better to pass the steam into a closed\r\ncopper coil in the liquor. Such a coil, with steam at 30 lb. pressure,\r\nwill heat about 27-1/2 gal. per hour per square foot of surface from\r\n46° F. to boiling, and evaporate about half that quantity of liquor\r\nalready at boiling temperature. (See Box, 'Treatise on Heat,' p. 176.)\r\nHeating coils must of course be provided with steam traps to carry off\r\ncondensed water; and in boiling by open steam it is very desirable\r\nto let the steam pass through such a trap before use, to stop water\r\ncondensed in the pipes, which usually contains iron, and discolours the\r\nliquors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nDRYING-SHEDS FOR LEATHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primitive way of drying leather was to hang it on poles in the\r\nopen air, but this in our uncertain climate has become quite obsolete.\r\nThe oldest plan now actually in use is to hang on poles in a shed\r\ngenerally raised some height above the ground, so as to catch the wind,\r\nand provided on all sides with louvre boards arranged so as to open\r\nand shut as required. These sheds, to give good results (especially on\r\nmixed tannages, which need much more care in drying than bark), demand\r\nvery watchful management. In windy weather, and with wet leather at\r\nall times, the louvres must be kept nearly or quite closed, and on the\r\nsunny side of the shed the same precaution is generally necessary.\r\nAgain, in very damp weather the leather does not dry at all, and in\r\nfrosty seasons it is apt to freeze, by which sole leather is made soft\r\nand spongy, and dressing leather, though whitened, is said to be less\r\ncapable of carrying grease. To prevent freezing, and to enable leather\r\nto be dried in damp or cold weather, it became customary to provide\r\nsheds with ranges of steam-pipes on the floor; this, though decidedly a\r\nvaluable addition, has not proved by any means an entirely satisfactory\r\nsolution of the problem of leather drying. No sufficient means are\r\nprovided for controlling the ventilation, and the upward currents of\r\nhot air dry the leather irregularly, and produce bad colour. A much\r\nmore satisfactory shed is the American turret drier.\r\n\r\nThis consists of a lofty building, 3 to 8 stories high, without\r\nlouvres, but with latticed floors. J. S. Schultz recommends 5 stories,\r\nof 7 ft. clear between beams, as a convenient height, and the building\r\nshould be divided by partitions from top to bottom into 4 or more\r\nseries of chambers one above another, each of which is capable of\r\nhaving the heat and ventilation separately regulated. The Americans\r\nusually fill one of these series at once, and dry off the whole in\r\nabout 10 days, so that as many will be required for a tannery as will\r\nhold a 10 days' production. For ventilation, each of these sets of\r\nchambers is provided with a lantern ventilator at the top for the exit,\r\nand shutters or dampers on the bottom floor for the admission of air.\r\nThe bottom floor is also provided with steam-pipes, of which those for\r\neach set of compartments are controlled by a separate cock. When warmth\r\nis applied at the bottom, the tall building acts like a chimney, and a\r\ncontinuous current of air passes from the ventilators at the base up to\r\nthose at the top. The usual American practice is, after filling one of\r\nthese ranges of compartments, to apply no steam-heat for the first 3\r\nor 4 days, and, if the weather be dry or windy to keep the ventilators\r\nalso closed. After the third or fourth day, a moderate degree of heat\r\nis given, and this is increased so that at the end of about 10 days the\r\nstock is fully dry.\r\n\r\nThis is in accordance with a common American practice, in which the\r\nleather is fully dried before rolling, in order to fix the soluble\r\ncolour, and prevent it striking out to the surface in the finishing.\r\nThe wet leather is raised by an elevator, consisting of an endless\r\nchain provided with hooks, to which the leather is attached at the\r\nbottom, and from which it is taken at the top. Various ways are adopted\r\nto lower the leather from these tall turrets to the room where it is\r\nstored prior to damping down for rolling. In some cases, the lattice\r\nfloors are made movable, and the whole contents of the room, including\r\nthe sticks from which the leather is hung, are allowed to fall into the\r\nlowest room. This method is of very questionable advantage, if we take\r\ninto account the labour of separating the sticks and carrying them back\r\nto their places. Another plan is to have shoots from each loft, down\r\nwhich the sides are slid to the rolling-room. The floors should have\r\nwhat light is necessary supplied through glass windows, so arranged as\r\nnot to admit direct sunlight.\r\n\r\nTo adapt the turret drier for English requirements, some slight\r\nmodification is needed, since we do not dry our leather right off,\r\nand then damp back, but, when it is suitably dry, lay it in a pile to\r\n\"sammy\" for striking; then, perhaps, after striking, hang up again for\r\na short time to temper for rolling, possibly again between rollings,\r\nand finally to dry off at a temperature of, say, 68-77° F. (20-25° C.).\r\nPerhaps on this account, the writer has seen no complete turret-driers\r\nin use in England, though a portion of one of the large sheds at\r\nDartford belonging to Messrs. Hepburn was converted by them some years\r\nsince into a very good turret, which gave excellent results both\r\nfor sole leather and kip butts in stuff. This turret is represented\r\nin section in Fig. 66, and is about 56 ft. × 24 ft. in area, and\r\n50 ft. high from the ground-line to the top of the roof, which is\r\nventilated by a dormer, _a_, with fixed louvres at the top, while air\r\nis admitted at the bottom through ventilators with sliding flaps, _b\r\nb_. It is heated by 10 rows of 4-in. steam-pipe, _c c_, each 54 ft.\r\nlong, making a total of 540 ft. run, or about 640 ft. superficial (a\r\n4-in. pipe being about 4-5/8 in. diameter outside). I am informed\r\nby Mr. J. G. Hepburn that he considers 4-in. pipes inferior for the\r\npurpose to smaller ones, giving too much heat in one place, and without\r\nsufficiently distributing it, and were he constructing a new turret he\r\nwould replace them by 1-1/2 in. wrought-iron, using about 3 of 1-1/2\r\nin. to replace 2 of 4 in., small pipes being much more effective (as\r\nwill be seen by table, p. 250) than larger ones, in proportion to\r\ntheir surface. He considers, however, that the best way of heating\r\ndrying-sheds, though more expensive in first cost, is by means of hot\r\nwater, which is much more constant in temperature than steam. Mr.\r\nHepburn, to whom I am much indebted for the above information, informs\r\nme that the turret still acts very well, drying kip butts on the\r\nupper floor a good colour in all weathers in about a week. He finds,\r\nhowever, that the steam-pipes as described are hardly sufficient in\r\nvery cold weather, and intends to increase them, or replace with\r\n1300-1400 ft. of hot water pipe heated by a saddle boiler. At Lowlights\r\ntannery, a shed arranged on the turret principle (though much less\r\ncompletely carried out from want of height in the buildings) has been\r\nfor many years in operation, principally for drying off sole-leather,\r\nwith the most satisfactory results.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66.]\r\n\r\nIt is noted by Box ('Practical Treatise on Heat,' p. 166) that an exit\r\nfor the moist air should not be placed at the top of a drying-chamber,\r\nbut at the bottom, since in the first case, the hot dry air tends to\r\nrise at once to the opening, and pass away unsaturated with moisture,\r\nwhile that cooled by evaporating water from the goods, being heavier,\r\ntends to form downward currents and remain in the chamber. To this it\r\nmay be objected that aqueous vapour is much lighter than air; this\r\nis true, other things being equal, but in practice the evaporation\r\nof a given quantity of water cools the air and makes it heavier in a\r\nmaterially greater degree than the admixture of aqueous vapour lightens\r\nit. This source of waste of heat exists in the turret drier, but is\r\nthere, from its great height, reduced to a minimum. In lower sheds it\r\nbecomes very material, and the air currents formed are productive of\r\nmuch harm by causing irregular drying. This difficulty has been met by\r\nMr. Edward Wilson, of Exeter, to whom the leather trade owes several\r\nvery useful inventions, by an ingenious drying-room constructed on\r\nthe lines indicated by Box, though I do not know that he was in any\r\nway indebted to that writer for the idea. In this Mr. Wilson arranges\r\nthe steam-pipes, instead of on the floor, in a vertical compartment\r\npartitioned from the chamber, through which air is admitted and heated.\r\nThis hot air fills the top of the chamber and from its lightness floats\r\nin a horizontal layer, only descending and escaping by apertures in the\r\nfloor as it becomes cooled by evaporating the moisture of the hides.\r\nMr. Wilson states that the method answers well in practice, and it is\r\ncertainly the most scientific in conception, but it might be feared\r\nthat, as applied to a single floor, the upper parts of the butts,\r\nsuspended near the ceiling, would dry more rapidly than those near\r\nthe floor. If applied to a double-floored building, this disadvantage\r\nwould, from the stronger draught, and consequent larger supply of air,\r\nbe less likely to show itself, and the upper floor with its uniform\r\nwarm air would be well adapted for drying off finished sole-leather,\r\nwhile the cooler and milder drying of the ground floor would be fitted\r\nboth in character and situation for that wet out of the yard. Special\r\nprecaution would be needed to prevent the heated air escaping by doors\r\nopening into the upper floor. There is little doubt that as regards\r\nheat this is the most economical system which has yet been invented.\r\n\r\nA method has been introduced in the United States of drying wet and\r\nfinished leather all together, in drying-rooms heated to a considerable\r\ntemperature, and closely shut up. This is found to answer fairly on\r\nleather from sour liquors, but that from strong and sweet liquors is\r\ndarkened, as might be expected. The drying is accomplished in much\r\nshorter time than by the turret drier. The mixture of wet and dry\r\nleather, and the lack of ventilation produce an atmosphere nearly\r\nsaturated with moisture, and hence the drying is not nearly so harsh as\r\nmight be supposed from the considerable temperatures made use of. There\r\ndoes not, however, seem anything in the principle to recommend its\r\ngeneral adoption.\r\n\r\nAnother invention, of which we have as yet heard little definite in\r\nEngland, consists in drying at a low temperature by air artificially\r\ndeprived of its moisture. This may be accomplished in several ways.\r\nExperiments have been made in drying in a closed chamber provided\r\nwith trays of calcium chloride to absorb the moisture evaporated. Air\r\nwhen artificially cooled by compression and subsequent expansion, as\r\nin the case of ice-making machines, parts with a large portion of its\r\nmoisture, which is condensed in the form of ice in the tubes of the\r\nmachine. Such air, if subsequently warmed, would dry powerfully and\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of drying-sheds, a few words on the\r\nmechanics of drying in general may not be out of place. Air-drying\r\nis dependent on the condition that the air must be capable of taking\r\nup more moisture than it already contains. It is a matter of common\r\nexperience that there are warm days when the air is so saturated with\r\nmoisture in the form of invisible vapour, that scarcely any drying\r\ntakes place; and similarly, cool dry days, when leather dries rapidly.\r\nThe relative amount of moisture in the air is easily ascertained by\r\nthe simple instrument known as the wet and dry bulb hygrometer; an\r\ninstrument which ought to be in every drying-shed, especially where\r\nsteam heat is used. It consists of two similar thermometers, side by\r\nside, of which one has the bulb covered with muslin and kept wet by a\r\npiece of lamp-cotton attached to it, and dipping in a cup or bottle of\r\nwater. This water evaporates more or less rapidly, according to the\r\ndryness of the air; and as heat is consumed by it in passing into the\r\ngaseous condition, the wet thermometer falls more or less below the dry\r\nin proportion to the rapidity of the evaporation. On a summer's day,\r\nthe difference may amount to 9°-12° F. (5°-7° C.), and this is about\r\nthe extreme dryness permissible in a drying-room for finished leather.\r\nWet leather should of course be dried much more slowly. The influence\r\nof heat on drying is two-fold. It increases the capacity of the air\r\nfor moisture, and it replaces the heat consumed by evaporation. The\r\nfollowing tables give the capacity of air for moisture at different\r\ntemperatures, and the percentage of saturation as shown by the wet and\r\ndry thermometer. At Greenwich, the mean humidity for the year is 82 per\r\ncent.; or for the day-time only 76 per cent., varying from 62 in summer\r\nto 86 in winter:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTable I.--Capacity of Air for Moisture.\r\n\r\n  ───────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────────┐\r\n             │ Weight in Pounds │  Weight in Pounds of │\r\n  Temp.

At least as much\r\nheat as this must be supplied if the air which has been used in drying\r\nis to retain the same temperature it had at the outset, and therefore\r\nif a turret is to keep at a higher temperature than the air, which is\r\nnecessary to create a draught, this is the minimum amount of heat which\r\nmust be supplied per pound of water to be evaporated. In practice much\r\nmore will be needed.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the heat given out by different sizes of\r\npipes at different temperatures, and steam pressures, in units equal to\r\nthe heat required to raise 1 lb. of water 1° F., and the cubic feet of\r\nair which they will heat.[V]\r\n\r\n[Footnote V: To illustrate the use of such tables, the following\r\nexample may be given. To dry 100 butts in a turret, each containing 20\r\nlb. of moisture, at least 20 × 1000 × 100 = 2,000,000 units of heat\r\nwill be required to replace the loss by evaporation alone. As a 4-in.\r\npipe at 300° gives off 669 units per foot per hour (see Table III.),\r\nabout 125 ft. would give off 2,000,000 units per day. If we compare\r\nthis with Mr. Hepburn's practical experience, supposing the 4 working\r\nfloors of his turret to hold 100 butts each (a low estimate), and to\r\ndry in 10 days; we have 540 ft. for 40 butts or 1350 ft. for 100 butts\r\na day; showing that more than 10 times the minimum is required in\r\npractice. Of course this allows for weather in which the air must be\r\nheated considerably before it will dry at all, for heat that escapes\r\nuselessly at the top and sides of the building, and for the fact that\r\nthe pipes are not heated the whole time, and probably, on the average,\r\nto a much lower temperature.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTable III.--Heating Effect of Pipes freely exposed to Air at 60° F.\r\n\r\n  ──────┬─────────┬──────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐\r\n        │         │Units of Heat per Ft.-run │  Cub.

Thus a pipe at 300° F. will only heat\r\nas much air at 80° F. as one of 280° F. will of air at 60° F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the efficiency of small pipes is much greater\r\nthan that of larger ones, and in these days of high-pressure steam,\r\nmuch may be said in favour of the use of comparatively small\r\nwrought-iron steam-pipes instead of the larger cast metal ones. The\r\nfirst cost is small, the pipes are easily obtained ready screwed, and\r\nin the lengths required, and may be put together by any intelligent\r\nworkman. The risk of fracture by the concussion of condensed water\r\nis very trifling, as compared to that of metal, and much lighter\r\npipes are safe for high pressures. Steam-pipes must always be laid\r\nwith an incline of say 1 in. in 10 ft. from the end where the steam\r\nis admitted, so that the condensed water may get away, and at the\r\nlowest point a steam-trap must be provided for its escape. In the\r\nwriter's experience, the best form is that of Holman, made by Tangye\r\nof Birmingham, of which the principle will readily be understood from\r\nFig. 67. The cup-shaped vessel _a_ floats on the water in the outer\r\ncasing, and so closes the valve _b_ until _a_ gets full, when it\r\nsinks and allows the water to escape until it floats up again. It is\r\nimportant that this trap should be set level, or the valve will not\r\nclose properly. Each pound of condensed water is equivalent to about\r\n1000 units of heat given off (see Table III.). In planning steam-pipes,\r\nit is not necessary that they should be arranged in a single line.\r\nEven if in gridiron form the steam will still reach every part, in\r\nproportion to the condensation which takes place. A series of large\r\npipes may be supplied by small pipes from a common main, and discharge\r\ntheir condensed water into a common waste-pipe with branch from each.\r\nA 1/2-in. pipe from a high-pressure boiler will supply a considerable\r\nrange, say 100 ft. of 4-in. pipe, though a larger size is advisable. At\r\nthe farther end of a range of steam-pipes a small tap must be provided\r\nto let out the air which accumulates in them. In employing the exhaust\r\nsteam of an engine for heating purposes, the pipes must be of ample\r\nsize and freely open at the ends to avoid back-pressure. For this\r\npurpose the gridiron form is a very good one.\r\n\r\nThe planning of hot-water pipes is much more difficult than that of\r\nsteam-pipes, but the general principle is that the pipes must rise\r\nall the way from the boiler to the farther end, where there must be\r\nan expansion-box or supply-cistern to allow the water to rise and\r\nfall and dissolved air to escape. From this the pipes must fall more\r\nor less, throughout the distance, back to the boiler, entering it at\r\nthe bottom. If at any point the pipe has to fall, leaving an upward\r\nbend, a tap must be provided for the escape of air, but such upward\r\nbends are a fertile source of difficulty and failure of action. With\r\nlong runs of either steam or water pipes, arrangements must be made\r\nto allow of expansion and contraction, which will amount to 1-2 in.\r\nper 100 ft., according to the temperature employed. If one end of the\r\nsystem can be left free, all that is needed is to support the pipes on\r\nrollers (pieces of old pipe may be used); if not, stuffing-boxes must\r\nbe provided.\r\n\r\nThe air heated by boilers, and other sources of waste heat, may often\r\nbe utilised for heating purposes, but generally requires to be driven\r\nby a fan, unless the drying-room can be arranged directly above the\r\nsource of heat. If air has to be conveyed, the air-ways must be of\r\nample size, and if the ascending force of heated air be relied on,\r\npassages less than 2 ft. sq. are seldom of much use. This ascending\r\nforce is generally much overrated where the differences of temperature\r\nare so small as those employed in a drying-room. In a boiler chimney,\r\nwhere the temperature of the escaping gases is 552° F. (289° C.), the\r\nspecific gravity of the air is about half that outside, and a chimney\r\nof 50 ft. in height gives a draught equal to the pressure of a column\r\nof about 1/3 in. of water, and the hot gases theoretically have a\r\nvelocity of about 80 ft. per second; whereas the same chimney with a\r\ndifference of temperature of 30° F. would have a draught equal to 1/300\r\nin. of water only, and a velocity of 8 ft. per second.\r\n\r\nThe following table will enable the reader to calculate approximately\r\nloss in friction in air-passages and the pressure required to pass a\r\ngiven volume of air. The pressure needed increases in proportion to the\r\nlength of the pipe and the square of the velocity of the current of air\r\nto be passed. Thus if we double the length of the pipe we must double\r\nthe pressure to pass the same quantity; and in order to double the\r\nquantity of air through a given pipe, the pressure must be quadrupled.\r\n\r\n\r\nTable IV.\r\n\r\n Head, or Difference of Pressure at the two ends of a Circular Pipe 1\r\n yd. long in inches of water required to pass 1000 cub. ft. of air per\r\n minute.\r\n\r\n  ────────────┬────────────┬─────────┬─────────────────────────────────\r\n  Velocity in │ Diameter of│  Head.  │\r\n  Ft. per Sec.│    Pipe.   │         │\r\n  ────────────┼────────────┼─────────┤\r\n              │    in.     │         │\r\n    84·8      │     6      │ ·186    │ }\r\n    37·7      │     9      │ ·02442  │ } To pass 100 ft. per min. these\r\n    21·2      │    12      │ ·00579  │ }   figures must be divided by\r\n     9·4      │    18      │ ·000763 │ }   100.

Many of the\r\nstatistics relating to skins are collective, and not specific; these\r\nwill be grouped under the heads of the respective countries, after all\r\naccessible details have been given upon each kind of skin.\r\n\r\n_Alligator._--In the Southern United States, notably Florida, the\r\nsupply of alligator-skins amounts to many thousands annually, and\r\nthe \"farming\" of the reptiles for their skins is even spoken of. The\r\nprincipal market for them is Europe, but no statistics of the trade\r\nare published. The alligators often attain a length of 18-20 ft. The\r\nhides are stripped off, and the belly and sides, the only portions fit\r\nfor use, are packed in barrels in a strong brine, and shipped to the\r\nNorthern tanner, who keeps them under treatment for 6-8 months, when\r\nthey are ready to be cut up. So far the leather has been principally\r\nused in the manufacture of boots and shoes, for which it is especially\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\n_Armadillo._--The skins of this animal were exported from Brunei\r\n(Borneo) to Singapore to the value of 121 _dol._ (of 4_s._ 2_d._) in\r\n1879.\r\n\r\n_Ass._--Hankow exported 2402-1/2 _piculs_ (of 133-1/2 lb.) of asses'\r\nskins in 1878, and 1068 _piculs_ in 1879.\r\n\r\n_Buffalo._--Manilla (Philippines), in 1878, exported 379 tons of\r\nbuffalo-skins, value 12,130_l._, and 274 tons of cuttings, 6579_l._\r\nHankow exported 1091 _piculs_ in 1878, and 1238 in 1879. Brunei\r\n(Borneo) sent 1362 _dol._ (of 4_s._ 2_d._) worth to Singapore\r\nin 1879. The approximate London market values of buffalo-skins\r\nare:--Batavia, 4_d._-7_d._ a lb.; Bengal, 3_d._-6_d._; other sorts,\r\n2-1/2_d._-6-1/2_d._\r\n\r\n_Calf._--Hamburg exported to Great Britain of calf and other skins\r\nin 1876, 20,731 cwt.; in 1877, 27,550; in 1878, 14,583; and in 1879,\r\n19,287 cwt. The Hawaiian Islands sent 168 pieces to Germany in 1879.\r\nChristiania shipped 31,000 _kroner_ (of 1_s._ 1-1/2_d._) worth to Great\r\nBritain in 1878, and 300 _kr._ in 1879. The exports from Archangel\r\n(including seal) in 1878 were 335 pieces to Holland, and 23,108 to\r\nGermany: total value, 2343_l._ Honolulu, in 1878, exported 651 pieces,\r\nbeing 500 to Germany, 135 to China, and 16 to the United States. Memel,\r\nin 1879, sent landwise over the Russian frontier for German markets,\r\n34,400 pieces, value 5450_l._ The approximate London market value of\r\ncalf-skins is 15_d._-34_d._ a lb.\r\n\r\n_Deer._--San José (Costa Rica) exported 12,121 lb. in 1878. Kiungchow\r\n(China) exported 17,544 pieces, value 541_l._, in 1879. Ciudad Bolivar\r\n(Venezuela), in 1879, sent 77,305 pieces (168,176-1/2 lb.) to New York,\r\nand 14,695 pieces to Germany. Guatemala, in 1879, exported 2353 pieces\r\nto Germany, 693 to New York, and 100 to Belize. Panama shipped 765_l._\r\nworth of deer and other skins to the United States in 1879. Costa Rica\r\nexported 82,168 lb. in the year ended April 30, 1879. Puerto Cabello\r\n(Venezuela), in 1879, shipped 2466 _kilo._ (of 2·2 lb.) to Great\r\nBritain, 11,619 to Germany, 6182 to the United States, and 1281 to\r\nHolland. The Commercial Society of Mozambique sold 41 deer, 391 buck,\r\n2168 blesbok, and 3071 other antelope skins at Rotterdam in June 1876.\r\nThe approximate London market values of deer-skins are: Blesbok, Cape,\r\n6-17_d._ a lb.; Deer, East Indian, 22-50_s._ a doz.\r\n\r\n_Dog._--Dog-skin makes a nice, thin, tough leather, but most of the\r\ngloves sold as dog-skin are made of lamb-skin.\r\n\r\n_Dugong and Manatee._--The skins of these animals, more important\r\nperhaps as oil-yielders, are smooth, bluish-black in colour, and nearly\r\n1 in. thick. They are well adapted for machine-belting. About 50 are\r\nshipped annually from Queensland.\r\n\r\n_Fish._--Although the skins of fish are chiefly gelatinous, and\r\neasily soluble in water, some are of a firm, strong texture, and of a\r\nuseful character. Up to within a few years, however, their employment\r\nfor practical purposes has been rather limited, and it is only\r\ncomparatively recently that attention has been more generally directed\r\nto their utilisation on an extended scale. At a Maritime Exhibition\r\nheld at the Westminster Aquarium in 1876, a Norway exhibitor showed a\r\nvariety of tanned fish-skins, among which were:--Tanned whale-skins;\r\nupper leather, made from the white whale, the source of the so-called\r\nporpoise hide used for laces; skins of flatfish, prepared for gloves;\r\nskins of soles, tanned and dressed for purses; skins of thornbacks,\r\nprepared as a substitute for sandpaper; and skins of eels, dressed and\r\ndyed, suitable for braces, &c. Shoes have been made at Gloucester,\r\nMass., from the skins of the cusk or torsk (_Brosmus vulgaris_), the\r\nuse of which has been patented, and an industry is said to be carried\r\non at Colborn, Canada, with the skins of species of siluroids for glove\r\nmaking. In Egypt, fish-skins from the Red Sea are used for soles of\r\nshoes. The skin of the losh or burbot (_Lota maculata_) is used by the\r\npeople in many parts of Russia and Siberia to trim their dresses. It\r\nis also utilised by some of the Tartar tribes as material for their\r\nsummer dresses, and the bags in which they pack their animal skins.\r\nThe spiny and tuberculous skins of many sharks and allied fishes are\r\nlargely employed, under various trade names, for polishing woods, and\r\nfor covering boxes, cases, &c. From a certain portion of the skin of\r\nthe angel shark (_Squalina angelus_) the Turks make the most beautiful\r\nsea-green watch cases. Turners, ebonists, and carpenters in Europe\r\nuse the rough skin of the blue dog-fish (_Squalus glaucus_), like\r\nemery paper, for smoothing their work and preparing it for polishing.\r\nThis shark-skin is also made into shagreen. That most used at present\r\nappears to be the skin of the ray (_Hypolophus sephen_), which is\r\nvery common on the Malabar coast. The house of Giraudon, Paris, makes\r\nexcellent use of them for morocco and _tabletterie_. At the recent\r\nParis Exhibition this establishment exhibited numerous illustrations of\r\nthe ornamental application of the prepared skin in large office-table\r\ninkstands, candlesticks, boxes and caskets, paper-knives, reticules,\r\ncard-cases, photograph frames, bracelets, scent bottles, &c. The fish\r\ncalled _chat_ (_Squalus catulus_) at Marseilles is smaller than the\r\nangel fish, and furnishes a product known as _peau de rousette_. This\r\nskin is reddish, and without spots, and of a uniform grain, flat, and\r\nonly used to make cases and other articles known as shagreen. _Peau de\r\nchien de mer_ is another name given to some species of _Squalus_. That\r\nfound on the French coasts is known under the names of _chien marin_,\r\n_rousette tigrée_, &c. Turners, cabinet makers, and carpenters use the\r\nskin for scraping and smoothing their work, and it is also used for\r\nlike purposes by metal workers. This skin, when worked up with the\r\ntubercles with which it is studded, takes the name of _galuchat_, and\r\nis usually dyed green, to cover cases, sheaths, and boxes. Under the\r\nname of _chagrin_, these skins used to be much employed in Turkey,\r\nSyria, Tunis, and Tripoli--that made in Tripoli being considered the\r\nbest. It was coloured black, green, white, and red. France imported\r\n18,000 lb. of ray-skins in 1863, chiefly from Portugal.\r\n\r\n_Goat and Kid._--Our imports of undressed goat-skins in 1883\r\nwere:--From Russia 18,355, 2523_l._; Sweden 1296, 229_l._; Norway\r\n19,391, 3316_l._; Denmark 11,012, 1856_l._; Germany 52,571, 5856_l._;\r\nHolland 13,336, 1858_l._; Belgium 40,518, 4632_l._; France 81,798,\r\n14,121_l._; Italy, 5708, 987_l._; Austrian territories 37,827,\r\n3844_l._; Turkey 38,166, 4580_l._; Egypt 16,228, 933_l._; British\r\nPossessions in South Africa 1,176,535, 139,632_l._; Aden 39,800,\r\n4797_l._; British India: Bombay 122,242, 10,487_l._; Madras 169,642,\r\n17,895_l._; Bengal 2,568,526, 203,256_l._; China 93,738, 5864_l._;\r\nAustralasia 44,340, 5518_l._; United States of America 6822, 845_l._;\r\nChile 16,756, 2553_l._; Brazil 159,949, 16,189_l._; Argentine Republic\r\n12,000, 952_l._; other countries 3239, 229_l._; total 4,749,795,\r\n452,952_l._ Ciudad Bolivar (Venezuela) sent 317 pieces (284 lb.) to New\r\nYork in 1879. Tripoli exported 7000_l._ worth in 1879, and 3000_l._ in\r\n1880. In 1880, a number of raw goat-skins were sent from the Marche\r\nand Romagna to the United States, weighing about 1-1/2 _kilo._ (of 2·2\r\nlb.) each, and to be used chiefly for ladies' shoes and pocket-books.\r\nShanghai, in 1878, exported 164,285 pieces. Tangier, in 1879, sent 12\r\ncwt., 60_l._, to Great Britain; 3637 cwt., 18,185_l._, to France and\r\nAlgiers; 10 cwt., 50_l._, to Spain; total, 14,636 doz., 18,295_l._;\r\nand 3046 cwt., 13,707_l._, in 1880. The Hawaiian Islands, in 1879,\r\nshipped 24,940 pieces to the United States (Pacific ports). In 1879,\r\nChristiania exported 65,000 _kroner_ (of 1_s._ 1-1/2_d._) worth of\r\ngoat and sheep skins to Great Britain. The shipments of goat and kid\r\nskins from the French East Indies fell from 5500 in 1876, to 4894 in\r\n1877, and 300 in 1879, with none since. The shipments from the Cape\r\nto Great Britain were 794,637 in 1878, 657,509 in 1879, and 934,810\r\nin 1880. Cadiz, in 1877, sent 404 _kilo._ (of 2·2 lb.) of kid skins,\r\nvalue 84_l._, to Great Britain, and 3866 _kilo._ 805_l._, to France.\r\nPuerto Cabello (Venezuela), in 1879, despatched 28,684 _kilo._ to\r\nGermany, 124,964 to the United States, 14,295 to France, and 18,536\r\nto Holland. Honolulu sent 64,525 pieces to the United States in 1878.\r\nSamsoun (Turkey) exported 130,700 _kilo._, 6796_l._, to France in\r\n1878. The Cape exports fell from 1,478,761 pieces in 1874, to 687,570\r\nin 1879. Memel sent by sea 7 cwt., 73_l._, in 1879. Tientsin (China)\r\nexported 38,107 _piculs_ (of 133-1/3 lb.) in 1879. Mogador (Morocco)\r\nforwarded 112,974 doz., 59,243_l._, to Marseilles in 1878, and 8407\r\nbales, 48,000_l._, in 1880; these skins are used for the manufacture of\r\nmorocco leather, for which they are peculiarly suitable, owing to their\r\nfineness of grain, caused, it is said, by the rich diet, consisting\r\nof the fruits of the argan tree. The approximate London market values\r\nof goat-skins are:--East Indian, 4-15_d._ a lb.; best tanned, 2_s._\r\n4_d._-3_s._ 8_d._; inferior to good tanned, 9_d._-2_s._ 5_d._; Cape,\r\nbest, 11-18_d._; Cape, inferior to good, 8-14_d._ Turkey is one of the\r\nlargest rearers of goats, and consequently the manufacture of morocco\r\nleather is extensively carried on in that country. Formerly, nearly\r\nall the buck-skins found their way to London, but they were displaced\r\nby Indian goat-skins; and, for a time, the exportation of Turkish\r\nbuck-skins experienced a check, the result being the establishment\r\nof a large number of manufactories in Vienna and the different\r\nAustro-Hungarian provinces. These establishments have prospered and\r\nbeen enlarged, and get the major portion of their goat-skins from\r\nthe London market. It is, however, proposed in Austria to do without\r\nthe London market in future, and to institute at Trieste periodical\r\nsales of goat-skins, which will be, especially for Vienna, of great\r\nadvantage from the point of view of cost of transport. Notwithstanding\r\nthe exportation of buck-, goat-, and sheep-skins from Turkey, there\r\nare still sufficient remaining in the country to form the basis of a\r\nvery flourishing and entirely indigenous industry. The Turk is very\r\nunskilful in the manufacture of sole leather; but the article in which\r\nhe excels is morocco leather for slippers, tanned exclusively with\r\nsumach. The production of tanned buck-skins reaches yearly a total of\r\nnearly a million skins, and of sheep half a million; the best kinds are\r\nthose of Philippopolis, Samakof, and Peristra. The Bulgarian skins are\r\nnot so well tanned as those mentioned, although the quality of the raw\r\nskins is superior. The best at the present day are those of Sophia.\r\n\r\n_Horse._--Shanghai exported 458-1/2 _piculs_ in 1878. Rio Grande do Sul\r\nexported 10,714 pieces salted, and 601 dried, in 1879.
