Heath & Co., Publishers\r\nBoston New York Chicago\r\n\r\n1900\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n    And lo! the book, from all its end beguiled,\r\n    A harmless wonder to some happy child.\r\n\r\n    LORD LYTTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nGulliver's Travels was published in 1726; and, although it was by no\r\nmeans intended for them, the book was soon appropriated by the children,\r\nwho have ever since continued to regard it as one of the most delightful\r\nof their story books. They cannot comprehend the occasion which provoked\r\nthe book nor appreciate the satire which underlies the narrative, but\r\nthey delight in the wonderful adventures, and wander full of open-eyed\r\nastonishment into the new worlds through which the vivid and logically\r\naccurate imagination of the author so personally conducts them. And\r\nthere is a meaning and a moral in the stories of the Voyages to Lilliput\r\nand Brobdingnag which is entirely apart from the political satire they\r\nare intended to convey, a meaning and a moral which the youngest child\r\nwho can read it will not fail to seize, and upon which it is scarcely\r\nnecessary for the teacher to comment.\r\n\r\nFor young children the book combines in a measure the interest of\r\n_Robinson Crusoe_ and that of the fairy tale; its style is objective,\r\nthe narrative is simple, and the matter appeals strongly to the childish\r\nimagination. For more mature boys and girls and for adults the interest\r\nis found chiefly in the keen satire which underlies the narrative. It\r\nappeals, therefore, to a very wide range of intelligence and taste, and\r\ncan be read with profit by the child of ten and by the young man or\r\nwoman of mature years.\r\n\r\nThis edition is practically a reprint of the original (1726-27). The\r\npunctuation and capitalization have been modernized, some archaisms\r\nchanged, and the paragraphs have been made more frequent. A few passages\r\nhave been omitted which would offend modern ears and are unsuitable for\r\nchildren's reading, and some foot-notes have been added explaining\r\nobsolete words and obscure expressions.\r\n\r\nAs a reading book in school which must be adapted to the average mind,\r\nthese stories will be found suitable for classes from the fifth or sixth\r\nschool year to the highest grade of the grammar school.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS M.

there is likewise some relation between us on the\r\nmother's side. About three years ago, Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of the\r\nconcourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,[1]\r\nmade a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark, in\r\nNottinghamshire, his native county, where he now lives retired, yet in\r\ngood esteem among his neighbors.\r\n\r\nAlthough Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his father\r\ndwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from Oxfordshire; to\r\nconfirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at Banbury, in that\r\ncounty, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers. Before he quitted\r\nRedriff he left the custody of the following papers in my hands, with\r\nthe liberty to dispose of them as I should think fit. I have carefully\r\nperused them three times. The style is very plain and simple, and the\r\nonly fault I find is, that the author, after the manner of travellers,\r\nis a little too circumstantial. There is an air of truth apparent\r\nthrough the whole; and, indeed, the author was so distinguished for his\r\nveracity, that it became a sort of proverb among his neighbors at\r\nRedriff, when any one affirmed a thing, to say it was as true as if Mr.\r\nGulliver had spoken it.\r\n\r\nBy the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the author's\r\npermission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to send them into\r\nthe world, hoping they may be, at least for some time, a better\r\nentertainment than the common scribbles about politics and party.\r\n\r\nThis volume would have been at least twice as large if I had not made\r\nbold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and tides,\r\nas well as to the variations and bearings in the several voyages;\r\ntogether with the minute description of the management of the ship in\r\nthe storms, in the style of sailors; likewise the account of longitudes\r\nand latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend that Mr. Gulliver may\r\nbe a little dissatisfied; but I was resolved to fit the work as much as\r\npossible to the general capacity of readers. However, if my own\r\nignorance in sea affairs shall have led me to commit some mistakes, I\r\nalone am answerable for them, and if any traveller hath a curiosity to\r\nsee the whole work at large, as it came from the hand of the author, I\r\nwill be ready to gratify him.\r\n\r\nAs for any farther particulars relating to the author, the reader will\r\nreceive satisfaction from the first pages of the book.\r\n\r\n                                        RICHARD SYMPSON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVELS.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A VOYAGE TO LILLIPUT_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR GIVES SOME ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF AND FAMILY: HIS FIRST\r\n     INDUCEMENTS TO TRAVEL. HE IS SHIPWRECKED, AND SWIMS FOR HIS LIFE;\r\n     GETS SAFE ASHORE IN THE COUNTRY OF LILLIPUT; IS MADE A PRISONER,\r\n     AND CARRIED UP THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third of five\r\nsons. He sent me to Emmanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen years old,\r\nwhere I resided three years, and applied myself close to my studies;\r\nbut the charge of maintaining me, although I had a very scanty\r\nallowance, being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice\r\nto Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued\r\nfour years; and my father now and then sending me small sums of money, I\r\nlaid them out in learning navigation, and other parts of the mathematics\r\nuseful to those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be,\r\nsome time or other, my fortune to do. When I left Mr. Bates, I went down\r\nto my father, where, by the assistance of him, and my uncle John and\r\nsome other relations, I got forty pounds,[2] and a promise of thirty\r\npounds a year, to maintain me at Leyden. There I studied physic two\r\nyears and seven months, knowing it would be useful in long voyages.\r\n\r\nSoon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master,\r\nMr. Bates, to be surgeon to the \"Swallow,\" Captain Abraham Pannell,\r\ncommander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage\r\nor two into the Levant,[3] and some other parts. When I came back I\r\nresolved to settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged\r\nme, and by him I was recommended to several patients. I took part of a\r\nsmall house in the Old Jewry; and, being advised to alter my condition,\r\nI married Mrs. Mary Burton,[4] second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton,\r\nhosier in Newgate Street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nBut my good master, Bates, dying in two years after, and I having few\r\nfriends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer\r\nme to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren. Having,\r\ntherefore, consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I\r\ndetermined to go again to sea. I was surgeon successively in two ships,\r\nand made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by\r\nwhich I got some addition to my fortune. My hours of leisure I spent in\r\nreading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with\r\na good number of books; and, when I was ashore, in observing the manners\r\nand dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language,\r\nwherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my memory.\r\n\r\nThe last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of\r\nthe sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family. I removed\r\nfrom the Old Jewry to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to\r\nget business among the sailors; but it would not turn to account. After\r\nthree years' expectation that things would mend, I accepted an\r\nadvantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master of the\r\n\"Antelope,\" who was making a voyage to the South Sea.[5] We set sail\r\nfrom Bristol, May 4, 1699; and our voyage at first was very prosperous.\r\n\r\nIt would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with the\r\nparticulars of our adventures in those seas. Let it suffice to inform\r\nhim, that, in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were driven\r\nby a violent storm, to the northwest of Van Diemen's Land.[6]\r\n\r\nBy an observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees and\r\n2 minutes south. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labor and\r\nill food; the rest were in a very weak condition.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth of November, which was the beginning of summer in those\r\nparts, the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock within half\r\na cable's length of the ship;[7] but the wind was so strong, that we\r\nwere driven directly upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of\r\nwhom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to\r\nget clear of the ship and the rock. We rowed, by my computation, about\r\nthree leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being already spent\r\nwith labor, while we were in the ship. We, therefore, trusted ourselves\r\nto the mercy of the waves; and, in about half an hour, the boat was\r\noverset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of my companions\r\nin the boat, as well as those who escaped on the rock, or were left in\r\nthe vessel, I cannot tell, but conclude they were all lost.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward\r\nby wind and tide. I often let my legs drop, and could feel no bottom;\r\nbut, when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no longer, I found\r\nmyself within my depth; and, by this time, the storm was much abated.\r\n\r\nThe declivity was so small that I walked near a mile before I got to the\r\nshore, which I conjectured was about eight o'clock in the evening. I\r\nthen advanced forward near half a mile, but could not discover any sign\r\nof houses or inhabitants; at least, I was in so weak a condition, that I\r\ndid not observe them. I was extremely tired, and with that, and the\r\nheat of the weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I\r\nleft the ship, I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the\r\ngrass, which was very short and soft, where I slept sounder than ever I\r\nremembered to have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about nine\r\nhours; for, when I awaked, it was just daylight. I attempted to rise,\r\nbut was not able to stir: for as I happened to lie on my back, I found\r\nmy arms and legs were strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and\r\nmy hair, which was long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I\r\nlikewise felt several slender ligatures across my body, from my arm-pits\r\nto my thighs. I could only look upwards, the sun began to grow hot, and\r\nthe light offended my eyes.\r\n\r\nI heard a confused noise about me; but, in the posture I lay, could see\r\nnothing except the sky. In a little time, I felt something alive moving\r\non my left leg, which, advancing gently forward over my breast, came\r\nalmost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes downward, as much as I\r\ncould, I perceived it to be a human creature, not six inches high, with\r\na bow and arrow in his hands, and a quiver at his back. In the meantime\r\nI felt at least forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured) following\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\nI was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud that they all ran\r\nback in a fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt\r\nwith the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground.\r\nHowever, they soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to\r\nget a full sight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of\r\nadmiration, cried out in a shrill, but distinct voice--_Hekinah degul!_\r\nthe others repeated the same words several times, but I then knew not\r\nwhat they meant.\r\n\r\nI lay all this while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness. At\r\nlength, struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings,\r\nand wrench out the pegs, that fastened my left arm to the ground; for by\r\nlifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to\r\nbind me, and, at the same time, with a violent pull, which gave me\r\nexcessive pain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair\r\non the left side, so that I was just able to turn my head about two\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nBut the creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them;\r\nwhereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it\r\nceased, I heard one of them cry aloud, _Tolgo phonac_; when, in an\r\ninstant, I felt above an hundred arrows discharged on my left hand,\r\nwhich pricked me like so many needles; and, besides, they shot another\r\nflight into the air, as we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose,\r\nfell on my body (though I felt them not), and some on my face, which I\r\nimmediately covered with my left hand.\r\n\r\nWhen this shower of arrows was over, I fell a-groaning with grief and\r\npain, and then striving again to get loose, they discharged another\r\nvolley larger than the first, and some of them attempted with spears to\r\nstick me in the sides; but by good luck I had on me a buff jerkin,[8]\r\nwhich they could not pierce. I thought it the most prudent method to lie\r\nstill, and my design was to continue so till night, when, my left hand\r\nbeing already loose, I could easily free myself; and as for the\r\ninhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for the\r\ngreatest army they could bring against me, if they were all of the same\r\nsize with him that I saw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I LAY ALL THIS WHILE IN GREAT UNEASINESS\" P. 8.]\r\n\r\nBut fortune disposed otherwise of me. When the people observed I was\r\nquiet, they discharged no more arrows: but, by the noise I heard, I knew\r\ntheir numbers increased; and about four yards from me, over against my\r\nright ear, I heard a knocking for above an hour, like that of people at\r\nwork; when, turning my head that way, as well as the pegs and strings\r\nwould permit me, I saw a stage erected, about a foot and a half from the\r\nground, capable of holding four of the inhabitants, with two or three\r\nladders to mount it; from whence one of them, who seemed to be a person\r\nof quality, made me a long speech, whereof I understood not one\r\nsyllable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut I should have mentioned, that before the principal person began his\r\noration, he cried out three times, _Langro debul san_ (these words, and\r\nthe former, were afterwards repeated, and explained to me). Whereupon\r\nimmediately about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the strings that\r\nfastened the left side of my head, which gave me the liberty of turning\r\nit to the right, and of observing the person and gesture of him that was\r\nto speak. He appeared to be of a middle age, and taller than any of the\r\nother three who attended him, whereof one was a page that held up his\r\ntrain, and seemed to be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other\r\ntwo stood one on each side, to support him. He acted every part of an\r\norator, and I could observe many periods of threatenings, and others of\r\npromises, pity, and kindness.\r\n\r\nI answered in a few words, but in the most submissive manner, lifting up\r\nmy left hand, and both my eyes, to the sun, as calling him for a\r\nwitness: and, being almost famished with hunger, having not eaten a\r\nmorsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the demands of\r\nnature so strong upon me, that I could not forbear showing my impatience\r\n(perhaps against the strict rules of decency) by putting my finger\r\nfrequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food. The _hurgo_ (for\r\nso they call a great lord, as I afterwards learned) understood me very\r\nwell. He descended from the stage, and commanded that several ladders\r\nshould be applied to my sides; on which above a hundred of the\r\ninhabitants mounted, and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets\r\nfull of meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the king's\r\norders, upon the first intelligence he received of me.\r\n\r\nI observed there was the flesh of several animals, but could not\r\ndistinguish them by the taste. There were shoulders, legs, and loins,\r\nshaped like those of mutton, and very well dressed, but smaller than the\r\nwings of a lark. I ate them by two or three at a mouthful, and took\r\nthree loaves at a time, about the bigness of musket bullets. They\r\nsupplied me as they could, showing a thousand marks of wonder and\r\nastonishment at my bulk and appetite. I then made another sign that I\r\nwanted drink.\r\n\r\nThey found by my eating that a small quantity would not suffice me; and\r\nbeing a most ingenious people, they slung up with great dexterity, one\r\nof their largest hogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out\r\nthe top: I drank it off at a draught; which I might well do, for it did\r\nnot hold half a pint, and tasted like a small[9] wine of Burgundy, but\r\nmuch more delicious. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in\r\nthe same manner, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me.\r\n\r\nWhen I had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and danced\r\nupon my breast, repeating, several times, as they did at first, _Hekinah\r\ndegul_. They made me a sign, that I should throw down the two hogsheads,\r\nbut first warning the people below to stand out of the way, crying\r\naloud, _Borach nevola_; and, when they saw the vessels in the air, there\r\nwas an universal shout of _Hekinah degul_.\r\n\r\nI confess, I was often tempted, while they were passing backwards and\r\nforwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the first that came in\r\nmy reach, and dash them against the ground. But the remembrance of what\r\nI had felt, which probably might not be the worst they could do, and the\r\npromise of honor I made them--for so I interpreted my submissive\r\nbehavior--soon drove out those imaginations. Besides, I now considered\r\nmyself as bound, by the laws of hospitality, to a people who had treated\r\nme with so much expense and magnificence. However, in my thoughts I\r\ncould not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive\r\nmortals, who durst venture to mount and walk upon my body, while one of\r\nmy hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight of so\r\nprodigious a creature, as I must appear to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"PRODUCING HIS CREDENTIALS.\" P. 14.]\r\n\r\nAfter some time, when they observed that I made no more demands for\r\nmeat, there appeared before me a person of high rank from his imperial\r\nmajesty. His excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg,\r\nadvanced forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue: and,\r\nproducing his credentials under the signet-royal,[10] which he applied\r\nclose to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes, without any signs of anger,\r\nbut with a kind of determinate resolution, often pointing forwards,\r\nwhich, as I afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half a\r\nmile distant, whither it was agreed by his majesty in council that I\r\nmust be conveyed. I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made a\r\nsign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his\r\nexcellency's head, for fear of hurting him or his train) and then to my\r\nown head and body, to signify that I desired my liberty.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that he understood me well enough, for he shook his head by\r\nway of disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to show that I\r\nmust be carried as a prisoner. However, he made other signs, to let me\r\nunderstand that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good\r\ntreatment. Whereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my\r\nbonds; but again, when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and\r\nhands, which were all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking\r\nin them, and observing, likewise, that the number of my enemies\r\nincreased, I gave tokens to let them know, that they might do with me\r\nwhat they pleased. Upon this the _hurgo_ and his train withdrew, with\r\nmuch civility, and cheerful countenances.\r\n\r\nSoon after, I heard a general shout, with frequent repetitions of the\r\nwords, _Peplom selan_, and I felt great numbers of people on my left\r\nside, relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was able to turn upon\r\nmy right, and to get a little ease. But, before this, they had daubed my\r\nface and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the\r\nsmell, which, in a few minutes, removed all the smart of their arrows.\r\nThese circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their\r\nvictuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep. I\r\nslept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no\r\nwonder, for the physicians, by the emperor's order, had mingled a sleepy\r\npotion in the hogsheads of wine.\r\n\r\nIt seems that, upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the\r\nground after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it, by an\r\nexpress; and determined in council, that I should be tied in the manner\r\nI have related (which was done in the night, while I slept), that plenty\r\nof meat and drink should be sent to me, and a machine prepared to carry\r\nme to the capital city.\r\n\r\nThis resolution, perhaps, may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am\r\nconfident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe, on the like\r\noccasion. However, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as\r\ngenerous; for, supposing these people had endeavored to kill me with\r\ntheir spears and arrows, while I was asleep, I should certainly have\r\nawaked with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused my\r\nrage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith\r\nI was tied; after which, as they were not able to make resistance, so\r\nthey could expect no mercy.\r\n\r\nThese people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to a great\r\nperfection in mechanics, by the countenance and encouragement of the\r\nemperor, who is a renowned patron of learning. The prince hath several\r\nmachines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees, and other great\r\nweights. He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine\r\nfeet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried on\r\nthese engines three or four hundred yards to the sea. Five hundred\r\ncarpenters and engineers were immediately set to work, to prepare the\r\ngreatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood, raised three inches\r\nfrom the ground, about seven feet long and four wide, moving upon\r\ntwenty-two wheels. The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this\r\nengine, which, it seems, set out in four hours after my landing. It was\r\nbrought parallel to me, as I lay. But the principal difficulty was, to\r\nraise and place me in this vehicle.\r\n\r\nEighty poles, each of one foot high, were erected for this purpose, and\r\nvery strong cords, of the bigness of packthread, were fastened by hooks\r\nto many bandages, which the workmen had girt round my neck, my hands, my\r\nbody, and my legs. Nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to\r\ndraw up these cords by many pulleys fastened on the poles; and thus, in\r\nless than three hours, I was raised and slung into the engine, and tied\r\nfast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAll this I was told; for, while the whole operation was performing, I\r\nlay in a profound sleep, by the force of that soporiferous medicine\r\ninfused into my liquor. Fifteen hundred of the emperor's largest horses,\r\neach about four inches and a half high, were employed to draw me\r\ntowards the metropolis, which, as I said, was half a mile distant.\r\n\r\nAbout four hours after we began our journey, I awaked, by a very\r\nridiculous accident; for, the carriage being stopt a while, to adjust\r\nsomething that was out of order, two or three of the young natives had\r\nthe curiosity to see how I looked, when I was asleep. They climbed up\r\ninto the engine, and advancing very softly to my face, one of them, an\r\nofficer in the guards, put the sharp end of his half-pike[11] a good way\r\nup into my left nostril, which tickled my nose like a straw, and made me\r\nsneeze violently; whereupon they stole off, unperceived, and it was\r\nthree weeks before I knew the cause of my awaking so suddenly.\r\n\r\nWe made a long march the remaining part of the day, and rested at night\r\nwith five hundred guards on each side of me, half with torches, and half\r\nwith bows and arrows, ready to shoot me, if I should offer to stir. The\r\nnext morning, at sunrise, we continued our march, and arrived within two\r\nhundred yards of the city gates about noon. The emperor, and all his\r\ncourt, came out to meet us; but his great officers would by no means\r\nsuffer his majesty to endanger his person, by mounting on my body.\r\n\r\nAt the place where the carriage stopt, there stood an ancient temple,\r\nesteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom, which, having been\r\npolluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to the\r\nzeal of those people, looked upon as profane, and therefore had been\r\napplied to common use, and all the ornaments and furniture carried\r\naway. In this edifice it was determined I should lodge. The great gate,\r\nfronting to the north, was about four feet high, and almost two feet\r\nwide, through which I could easily creep. On each side of the gate was a\r\nsmall window, not above six inches from the ground; into that on the\r\nleft side the king's smith conveyed four score and eleven chains, like\r\nthose that hang to a lady's watch in Europe, and almost as large, which\r\nwere locked to my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOver against this temple, on the other side of the great highway, at\r\ntwenty feet distance, there was a turret at least five feet high. Here\r\nthe emperor ascended, with many principal lords of his court, to have an\r\nopportunity of viewing me, as I was told, for I could not see them. It\r\nwas reckoned that above an hundred thousand inhabitants came out of the\r\ntown upon the same errand; and, in spite of my guards, I believe there\r\ncould not be fewer than ten thousand, at several times, who mounted my\r\nbody, by the help of ladders. But a proclamation was soon issued, to\r\nforbid it, upon pain of death.\r\n\r\nWhen the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut\r\nall the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a\r\ndisposition as ever I had in my life. But the noise and astonishment of\r\nthe people, at seeing me rise and walk, are not to be expressed. The\r\nchains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not\r\nonly the liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semi-circle,\r\nbut, being fixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in,\r\nand lie at my full length in the temple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     THE EMPEROR OF LILLIPUT, ATTENDED BY SEVERAL OF THE NOBILITY, COMES\r\n     TO SEE THE AUTHOR IN HIS CONFINEMENT. THE EMPEROR'S PERSON AND\r\n     HABIT DESCRIBED. LEARNED MEN APPOINTED TO TEACH THE AUTHOR THEIR\r\n     LANGUAGE. HE GAINS FAVOR BY HIS MILD DISPOSITION. HIS POCKETS ARE\r\n     SEARCHED, AND HIS SWORD AND PISTOLS TAKEN FROM HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must confess I\r\nnever beheld a more entertaining prospect. The country around, appeared\r\nlike a continued garden, and the enclosed fields, which were generally\r\nforty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers. These fields were\r\nintermingled with woods of half a stang,[12] and the tallest trees, as I\r\ncould judge, appeared to be seven feet high. I viewed the town on my\r\nleft hand, which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theatre.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was already descended from the tower, and advancing on\r\nhorseback towards me, which had like to have cost him dear; for the\r\nbeast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to such a sight,\r\nwhich appeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up on his hind\r\nfeet. But that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept his seat, till\r\nhis attendants ran in and held the bridle, while his majesty had time to\r\ndismount.\r\n\r\nWhen he alighted, he surveyed me round with great admiration, but kept\r\nwithout the length of my chain. He ordered his cooks and butlers, who\r\nwere already prepared, to give me victuals and drink, which they pushed\r\nforward in a sort of vehicles upon wheels, till I could reach them. I\r\ntook these vehicles, and soon emptied them all; twenty of them were\r\nfilled with meat; each afforded me two or three good mouthfuls. The\r\nempress and young princes of the blood of both sexes, attended by many\r\nladies, sat at some distance in their chairs;[13] but upon the accident\r\nthat happened to the emperor's horse, they alighted, and came near his\r\nperson, which I am now going to describe. He is taller, by almost the\r\nbreadth of my nail, than any of his court, which alone is enough to\r\nstrike an awe into the beholders. His features are strong and masculine,\r\nwith an Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive, his\r\ncountenance erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his motions\r\ngraceful, and his deportment majestic. He was then past his prime, being\r\ntwenty-eight years and three-quarters old, of which he had reigned about\r\nseven in great felicity, and generally victorious. For the better\r\nconvenience of beholding him, I lay on my side, so that my face was\r\nparallel to his, and he stood but three yards off. However, I have had\r\nhim since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived in the\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHis dress was very plain and simple, and the fashion of it between the\r\nAsiatic and the European; but he had on his head a light helmet of gold,\r\nadorned with jewels, and a plume an the crest.[14] He held his sword\r\ndrawn in his hand, to defend himself, if I should happen to break loose;\r\nit was almost three inches long; the hilt and scabbard were gold,\r\nenriched with diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very clear and\r\narticulate, and I could distinctly hear it, when I stood up.\r\n\r\nThe ladies and courtiers were all most magnificently clad; so that the\r\nspot they stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread on the\r\nground, embroidered with figures of gold and silver. His imperial\r\nmajesty spoke often to me, and I returned answers, but neither of us\r\ncould understand a syllable. There were several of his priests and\r\nlawyers present (as I conjectured by their habits), who were commanded\r\nto address themselves to me; and I spoke to them in as many languages as\r\nI had the least smattering of, which were, High and Low Dutch, Latin,\r\nFrench, Spanish, Italian, and Lingua Franca;[15] but all to no purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter about two hours the court retired, and I was left with a strong\r\nguard, to prevent the impertinence, and probably the malice of the\r\nrabble, who were very impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst;\r\nand some of them had the impudence to shoot their arrows at me, as I sat\r\non the ground by the door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed\r\nmy left eye. But the colonel ordered six of the ring-leaders to be\r\nseized, and thought no punishment so proper as to deliver them bound\r\ninto my hands; which some of his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them\r\nforwards with the butt-ends of their pikes into my reach. I took them\r\nall on my right hand, put five of them into my coat-pocket; and as to\r\nthe sixth, I made a countenance as if I would eat him alive. The poor\r\nman squalled terribly, and the colonel and his officers were in much\r\npain, especially when they saw me take out my penknife; but I soon put\r\nthem out of fear, for, looking mildly, and immediately cutting the\r\nstrings he was bound with, I set him gently on the ground, and away he\r\nran. I treated the rest in the same manner, taking them one by one out\r\nof my pocket; and I observed both the soldiers and people were highly\r\ndelighted at this mark of my clemency, which was represented very much\r\nto my advantage at court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTowards night, I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on\r\nthe ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight, during which time\r\nthe emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me. Six hundred beds,\r\nof the common measure, were brought in carriages and worked up in my\r\nhouse; an hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the\r\nbreadth and length; and these were four double, which, however, kept me\r\nbut very indifferently from the hardness of the floor, which was of\r\nsmooth stone. By the same computation, they provided me with sheets,\r\nblankets, and coverlets, which were tolerable enough for one who had\r\nbeen so long inured to hardships as I.\r\n\r\nAs the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought\r\nprodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so that\r\nthe villages were almost emptied; and great neglect of tillage and\r\nhousehold affairs must have ensued, if his imperial majesty had not\r\nprovided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against this\r\ninconvenience. He directed that those who had already beheld me should\r\nreturn home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my house\r\nwithout license from court; whereby the secretaries of state got\r\nconsiderable fees.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the emperor held frequent councils, to debate what\r\ncourse should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a\r\nparticular friend, a person of great quality, who was as much in the\r\nsecret as any, that the court was under many difficulties concerning me.\r\nThey apprehended my breaking loose; that my diet would be very\r\nexpensive, and might cause a famine. Sometimes they determined to starve\r\nme, or at least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned arrows,\r\nwhich would soon despatch me: but again they considered that the stench\r\nof so large a carcase might produce a plague in the metropolis, and\r\nprobably spread through the whole kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these consultations, several officers of the army went\r\nto the door of the great council-chamber, and two of them being\r\nadmitted, gave an account of my behavior to the six criminals\r\nabove-mentioned, which made so favorable an impression in the breast of\r\nhis majesty, and the whole board, in my behalf, that an imperial\r\ncommission was issued out, obliging all the villages nine hundred yards\r\nround the city to deliver in, every morning, six beeves, forty sheep,\r\nand other victuals, for my sustenance; together with a proportionable\r\nquantity of bread and wine, and other liquors; for the due payment of\r\nwhich his majesty gave assignments upon his treasury. For this prince\r\nlives chiefly upon his own demesnes, seldom, except upon great\r\noccasions, raising any subsidies upon his subjects, who are bound to\r\nattend him in his wars at their own expense. An establishment was also\r\nmade of six hundred persons, to be my domestics, who had board-wages\r\nallowed for their maintenance, and tents built for them very\r\nconveniently on each side of my door.\r\n\r\nIt was likewise ordered that three hundred tailors should make me a suit\r\nof clothes, after the fashion of the country; that six of his majesty's\r\ngreatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language;\r\nand lastly, that the emperor's horses, and those of the nobility and\r\ntroops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to\r\naccustom themselves to me.\r\n\r\nAll these orders were duly put in execution, and in about three weeks I\r\nmade a great progress in learning their language; during which time the\r\nemperor frequently honored me with his visits, and was pleased to assist\r\nmy masters in teaching me. We began already to converse together in some\r\nsort; and the first words I learnt were to express my desire that he\r\nwould please give me my liberty, which I every day repeated on my\r\nknees. His answer, as I could apprehend it, was, that this must be a\r\nwork of time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council,\r\nand that first I must _lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon emposo_; that is,\r\nswear a peace with him and his kingdom. However, that I should be used\r\nwith all kindness; and he advised me to acquire, by my patience and\r\ndiscreet behavior, the good opinion of himself and his subjects.\r\n\r\nHe desired I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to certain proper\r\nofficers to search me; for probably I might carry about me several\r\nweapons which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered the bulk\r\nof so prodigious a person. I said his majesty should be satisfied, for I\r\nwas ready to strip myself and turn up my pockets before him. This I\r\ndelivered, part in words, and part in signs.\r\n\r\nHe replied, that by the laws of the kingdom, I must be searched by two\r\nof his officers; that he knew this could not be done without my consent\r\nand assistance; that he had so good an opinion of my generosity and\r\njustice, as to trust their persons in my hands; that whatever they took\r\nfrom me should be returned when I left the country, or paid for at the\r\nrate which I should set upon them. I took up the two officers in my\r\nhands, put them first into my coat-pockets, and then into every other\r\npocket about me, except my two fobs and another secret pocket, which I\r\nhad no mind should be searched, wherein I had some little necessaries\r\nthat were of no consequence to any but myself. In one of my fobs there\r\nwas a silver watch, and in the other a small quantity of gold in a\r\npurse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THESE GENTLEMEN MADE AN EXACT INVENTORY OF EVERYTHING\r\nTHEY SAW\" P. 30.]\r\n\r\nThese gentlemen having pen, ink, and paper about them, made an exact\r\ninventory of everything they saw; and, when they had done, desired I\r\nwould set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor. This\r\ninventory I afterwards translated into English, and is word for word as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n_Imprimis_,[16] In the right coat-pocket of the great man-mountain (for\r\nso I interpret the words _quinbus flestrin_), after the strictest\r\nsearch, we found only one great piece of coarse cloth, large enough to\r\nbe a foot-cloth for your majesty's chief room of state. In the left\r\npocket, we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal,\r\nwhich we the searchers were not able to lift. We desired it should be\r\nopened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid-leg\r\nin a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces, set us both\r\na sneezing for several times together. In his right waistcoat pocket we\r\nfound a prodigious number of white thin substances folded one over\r\nanother, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong cable, and\r\nmarked with black figures; which we humbly conceive to be writings,\r\nevery letter almost half as large as the palm of our hands. In the left,\r\nthere was a sort of engine, from the back of which were extended twenty\r\nlong poles, resembling the palisadoes before your majesty's court;\r\nwherewith we conjecture the man-mountain combs his head, for we did not\r\nalways trouble him with questions, because we found it a great\r\ndifficulty to make him understand us. In the large pocket on the right\r\nside of his middle cover (so I translate the word _ranfu-lo_, by which\r\nthey meant my breeches), we saw a hollow pillar of iron, about the\r\nlength of a man, fastened to a strong piece of timber, larger than the\r\npillar; and upon one side of the pillar were huge pieces of iron\r\nsticking out, cut into strange figures, which we know not what to make\r\nof. In the left pocket, another engine of the same kind. In the smaller\r\npocket on the right side were several round flat pieces of white and red\r\nmetal, of different bulk; some of the white, which seemed to be silver,\r\nwere so large and so heavy, that my comrade and I could hardly lift\r\nthem. In the left pocket, were two black pillars irregularly shaped; we\r\ncould not without difficulty reach the top of them, as we stood at the\r\nbottom of his pocket. One of them was covered, and seemed all of a\r\npiece; but at the upper end of the other, there appeared a white and\r\nround substance, about twice the bigness of our heads. Within each of\r\nthese was enclosed a prodigious plate of steel, which, by our orders, we\r\nobliged him to show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous\r\nengines. He took them out of their cases, and told us that in his own\r\ncountry his practice was to shave his beard with one of these, and to\r\ncut his meat with the other. There were two pockets which we could not\r\nenter: these he called his fobs. Out of the right fob hung a great\r\nsilver chain, with a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom. We directed\r\nhim to draw out whatever was at the end of that chain, which appeared to\r\nbe a globe, half silver, and half of some transparent metal; for on the\r\ntransparent side we saw certain strange figures, circularly drawn, and\r\nthought we could touch them till we found our fingers stopped by that\r\nlucid substance.[17] He put this engine to our ears, which made an\r\nincessant noise, like that of a water-mill; and we conjecture it is\r\neither some unknown animal, or the god that he worships; but we are more\r\ninclined to the latter opinion, because he assured us (if we understood\r\nhim right, for he expressed himself very imperfectly), that he seldom\r\ndid anything without consulting it. He called it his oracle, and said it\r\npointed out the time for every action of his life. From the left fob he\r\ntook out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to\r\nopen and shut like a purse, and served him for the same use; we found\r\ntherein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real\r\ngold, must be of immense value.\r\n\r\nHaving thus, in obedience to your majesty's commands, diligently\r\nsearched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist, made of\r\nthe hide of some prodigious animal, from which, on the left side, hung a\r\nsword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch,\r\ndivided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your\r\nmajesty's subjects. In one of these cells were several globes, or balls,\r\nof a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and required\r\na strong hand to lift them; the other cell contained a heap of certain\r\nblack grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we could hold about\r\nfifty of them in the palms of our hands.\r\n\r\nThis is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the\r\nman-mountain, who used us with great civility and due respect to your\r\nmajesty's commission. Signed and sealed, on the fourth day of the\r\neighty-ninth moon of your majesty's auspicious reign.\r\n\r\n                                        CLEFRIN FRELOC.\r\n                                        MARSI FRELOC.\r\n\r\nWhen this inventory was read over to the emperor, he directed me,\r\nalthough in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars.\r\n\r\nHe first called for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all. In\r\nthe meantime, he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then\r\nattended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows\r\njust ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for mine eyes were\r\nwholly fixed upon his majesty. He then desired me to draw my scimitar,\r\nwhich, although it had got some rust by the sea-water, was in most parts\r\nexceedingly bright. I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a\r\nshout between terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the\r\nreflection dazzled their eyes, as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my\r\nhand. His majesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted\r\nthan I could expect; he ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and\r\ncast it on the ground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end\r\nof my chain.\r\n\r\nThe next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars, by which\r\nhe meant my pocket-pistols. I drew it out, and at his desire, as well as\r\nI could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging it only with\r\npowder, which, by the closeness of my pouch, happened to escape wetting\r\nin the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent mariners take\r\nspecial care to provide), I first cautioned the emperor not to be\r\nafraid, and then let it off in the air.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment here was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar.\r\nHundreds fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even the\r\nemperor, although he stood his ground, could not recover himself in some\r\ntime I delivered up both my pistols, in the same manner as I had done\r\nmy scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and bullets, begging him that\r\nthe former might be kept from fire, for it would kindle with the\r\nsmallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI likewise delivered up my watch, which the emperor was very curious to\r\nsee, and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards[18] to bear\r\nit on a pole upon their shoulders, as draymen in England do a barrel of\r\nale. He was amazed at the continual noise it made and the motion of the\r\nminute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their sight is much more\r\nacute than ours. He asked the opinions of his learned men about it,\r\nwhich were various and remote, as the reader may well imagine without my\r\nrepeating; although, indeed, I could not very perfectly understand them.\r\n\r\nI then gave up my silver and copper money, my purse, with nine large\r\npieces of gold, and some smaller ones; my knife and razor, my comb and\r\nsilver snuffbox, my handkerchief and journal-book. My scimitar, pistols,\r\nand pouch were conveyed in carriages to his majesty's stores; but the\r\nrest of my goods were returned to me.\r\n\r\nI had, as I before observed, one private pocket, which escaped their\r\nsearch, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I sometimes use\r\nfor the weakness of mine eyes), a pocket perspective,[19] and some other\r\nlittle conveniences; which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I\r\ndid not think myself bound in honor to discover; and I apprehended they\r\nmight be lost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR DIVERTS THE EMPEROR AND HIS NOBILITY OF BOTH SEXES IN A\r\n     VERY UNCOMMON MANNER. THE DIVERSIONS OF THE COURT OF LILLIPUT\r\n     DESCRIBED. THE AUTHOR HAS HIS LIBERTY GRANTED HIM UPON CERTAIN\r\n     CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy gentleness and good behavior had gained so far on the emperor and his\r\ncourt, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to\r\nconceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time, I took all\r\npossible methods to cultivate this favorable disposition. The natives\r\ncame by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me. I would\r\nsometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my hand, and at\r\nlast the boys and girls would venture to come and play at hide and seek\r\nin my hair. I had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking\r\ntheir language.\r\n\r\nThe emperor had a mind, one day, to entertain me with one of the country\r\nshows, wherein they exceed all nations I have known, both for dexterity\r\nand magnificence. I was diverted with none so much as that of the\r\nrope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread, extended about two\r\nfeet, and twelve inches from the ground. Upon which I shall desire\r\nliberty, with the reader's patience, to enlarge a little.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis diversion is only practised by those persons who are candidates for\r\ngreat employments and high favor at court. They are trained in this art\r\nfrom their youth, and are not always of noble birth or liberal\r\neducation. When a great office is vacant, either by death or disgrace\r\n(which often happens) five or six of those candidates petition the\r\nemperor to entertain his majesty, and the court, with a dance on the\r\nrope, and whoever jumps the highest, without falling, succeeds in the\r\noffice. Very often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show\r\ntheir skill, and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their\r\nfaculty. Flimnap, the treasurer, is allowed to cut a caper on the\r\nstraight rope, at least an inch higher than any lord in the whole\r\nempire. I have seen him do the summersault several times together upon a\r\ntrencher,[20] fixed on a rope, which is no thicker than a common\r\npackthread in England. My friend Reldresal, principal secretary for\r\nprivate affairs, is, in my opinion, if I am not partial, the second\r\nafter the treasurer; the rest of the great officers are much upon a par.\r\n\r\nThese diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great\r\nnumbers are on record. I myself have seen two or three candidates break\r\na limb. But the danger is much greater when the ministers themselves are\r\ncommanded to show their dexterity! for, by contending to excel\r\nthemselves and their fellows, they strain so far that there is hardly\r\none of them who hath not received a fall, and some of them two or three.\r\nI was assured that a year or two before my arrival, Flimnap would have\r\ninfallibly broke his neck if one of the king's cushions, that\r\naccidentally lay on the ground, had not weakened the force of his fall.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before the\r\nemperor and empress and first minister, upon particular occasions. The\r\nemperor lays on the table three fine silken threads, of six inches long;\r\none is purple, the other yellow, and the third white. These threads are\r\nproposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor hath a mind to\r\ndistinguish by a peculiar mark of his favor. The ceremony is performed\r\nin his majesty's great chamber of state, where the candidates are to\r\nundergo a trial of dexterity very different from the former, and such as\r\nI have not observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the\r\nold or new world.\r\n\r\nThe emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends parallel to the\r\nhorizon, while the candidates, advancing one by one, sometimes leap over\r\nthe stick, sometimes creep under it, backwards and forwards several\r\ntimes, according as the stick is advanced or depressed. Sometimes the\r\nemperor holds one end of the stick, and his first minister the other:\r\nsometimes the minister has it entirely to himself. Whoever performs his\r\npart with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping and\r\ncreeping, is rewarded with the blue-colored silk; the yellow is given to\r\nthe next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt twice\r\nabout the middle; and you see few great persons round about this court\r\nwho are not adorned with one of these girdles.\r\n\r\nThe horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been\r\ndaily led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very\r\nfeet without starting. The riders would leap them over my hand as I held\r\nit on the ground; and one of the emperor's huntsmen, upon a large\r\ncourser, took my foot, shoe and all, which was indeed a prodigious leap.\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very\r\nextraordinary manner. I desired he would order several sticks of two\r\nfeet high, and the thickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me;\r\nwhereupon his majesty commanded the master of his woods to give\r\ndirections accordingly; and the next morning six wood-men arrived with\r\nas many carriages, drawn by eight horses to each.\r\n\r\nI took nine of these sticks, and fixing them firmly in the ground in a\r\nquadrangular figure, two feet and a half square, I took four other\r\nsticks and tied them parallel at each corner, about two feet from the\r\nground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood\r\nerect, and extended it on all sides, till it was as tight as the top of\r\na drum; and the four parallel sticks, rising about five inches higher\r\nthan the handkerchief, served as ledges on each side.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished my work, I desired the emperor to let a troop of his\r\nbest horse, twenty-four in number, come and exercise upon this plain.\r\nHis majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up one by one in\r\nmy hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers to exercise\r\nthem. As soon as they got into order, they divided into two parties,\r\nperformed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows, drew their swords,\r\nfled and pursued, attacked and retired, and, in short, discovered the\r\nbest military discipline I ever beheld. The parallel sticks secured them\r\nand their horses from falling over the stage: and the emperor was so\r\nmuch delighted that he ordered this entertainment to be repeated several\r\ndays, and once was pleased to be lifted up and give the word of command;\r\nand, with great difficulty, persuaded even the empress herself to let me\r\nhold her in her close chair within two yards of the stage, from whence\r\nshe was able to take a full view of the whole performance.\r\n\r\nIt was my good fortune that no ill accident happened in these\r\nentertainments; only once a fiery horse, that belonged to one of the\r\ncaptains, pawing with his hoof, struck a hole in my handkerchief, and\r\nhis foot slipping, he overthrew his rider and himself; but I immediately\r\nrelieved them both, and covering the hole with one hand, I set down the\r\ntroop with the other, in the same manner as I took them up. The horse\r\nthat fell was strained in the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt,\r\nand I repaired my handkerchief as well as I could; however, I would not\r\ntrust to the strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises.\r\n\r\nAbout two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was\r\nentertaining the court with feats of this kind, there arrived an express\r\nto inform his majesty that some of his subjects riding near the place\r\nwhere I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on\r\nthe ground, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round as wide as his\r\nmajesty's bed-chamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man;\r\nthat it was no living creature, as they had at first apprehended, for it\r\nlay on the grass without motion; and some of them had walked round it\r\nseveral times; that, by mounting upon each other's shoulders, they had\r\ngot to the top, which was flat and even, and, stamping upon it, they\r\nfound it was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be\r\nsomething belonging to the man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased,\r\nthey would undertake to bring it with only five horses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI presently knew what they meant, and was glad at heart to receive this\r\nintelligence. It seems, upon my first reaching the shore after our\r\nshipwreck, I was in such confusion that, before I came to the place\r\nwhere I went to sleep, my hat, which I had fastened with a string to my\r\nhead while I was rowing, and had stuck on all the time I was swimming,\r\nfell off after I came to land; the string, as I conjecture, breaking by\r\nsome accident which I never observed, but thought my hat had been lost\r\nat sea. I intreated his imperial majesty to give orders it might be\r\nbrought to me as soon as possible, describing to him the use and nature\r\nof it; and the next day the wagoners arrived with it, but not in a very\r\ngood condition; they had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and\r\na half of the edge, and fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks\r\nwere tied by a long cord to the harness; and thus my hat was dragged\r\nalong for above half an English mile; but the ground in that country\r\nbeing extremely smooth and level, it received less damage than I\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this adventure, the emperor, having ordered that part of\r\nthe army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in readiness,\r\ntook a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner. He desired\r\nI would stand like a colossus, with my legs as far asunder as I\r\nconveniently could. He then commanded his general (who was an old,\r\nexperienced leader and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in\r\nclose order and march under me; the foot by twenty-four abreast and the\r\nhorse by sixteen, with drums beating, colors flying, and pikes advanced.\r\nThis body consisted of three thousand foot and a thousand horse.\r\n\r\nI had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that his\r\nmajesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet, and then\r\nin full council; where it was opposed by none, except Skyrris Bolgolam\r\nwho was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy. But it\r\nwas carried against him by the whole board, and confirmed by the\r\nemperor. That minister was _galbet_, or admiral of the realm, very much\r\nin his master's confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of\r\na morose and sour complexion. However, he was at length persuaded to\r\ncomply; but prevailed, that the articles and conditions upon which I\r\nshould be set free, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThese articles were brought to me by Skyrris Bolgolam in person,\r\nattended by two under-secretaries, and several persons of distinction.\r\nAfter they were read, I was demanded to swear to the performance of\r\nthem, first in the manner of my own country, and afterwards in the\r\nmethod prescribed by their laws; which was, to hold my right foot in my\r\nleft hand, and to place the middle finger of my right hand on the crown\r\nof my head, and my thumb on the tip of my right ear.\r\n\r\nBut because the reader may be curious to have some idea of the style and\r\nmanner of expression peculiar to that people, as well as to know the\r\narticles upon which I recovered my liberty, I have made a translation of\r\nthe whole instrument, word for word, as near as I was able, which I here\r\noffer to the public.\r\n\r\n_Golbasto Momaren Evlame Gurdilo Shefin Mully Ully Gue_, Most Mighty\r\nEmperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of the universe, whose dominions\r\nextend five thousand _blustrugs_ (about twelve miles in circumference) to\r\nthe extremities of the globe; monarch of all monarchs, taller than the\r\nsons of men; whose feet press down to the centre, and whose head strikes\r\nagainst the sun; at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their\r\nknees; pleasant as the spring, comfortable as the summer, fruitful as\r\nautumn, dreadful as winter. His most sublime majesty proposeth to the\r\nman-mountain, lately arrived at our celestial dominions, the following\r\narticles, which by a solemn oath he shall be obliged to perform.\r\n\r\nFirst. The man-mountain shall not depart from our dominions without our\r\nlicense under our great seal.\r\n\r\nSecond. He shall not presume to come into our metropolis, without our\r\nexpress order, at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours\r\nwarning to keep within doors.\r\n\r\nThird. The said man-mountain shall confine his walks to our principal\r\nhigh roads, and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or field of\r\ncorn.[21]\r\n\r\nFourth. As he walks the said roads, he shall take the utmost care not to\r\ntrample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their horses or\r\ncarriages, nor take any of our subjects into his hands without their own\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nFifth. If an express requires extraordinary despatch, the man-mountain\r\nshall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a\r\nsix-days' journey once in every moon, and return the said messenger back\r\n(if so required) safe to our imperial presence.\r\n\r\nSixth. He shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of\r\nBlefuscu, and do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now\r\npreparing to invade us.\r\n\r\nSeventh. That the said man-mountain shall at his times of leisure be\r\naiding and assisting to our workmen, in helping to raise certain great\r\nstones, towards covering the wall of the principal park, and other our\r\nroyal buildings.\r\n\r\nEighth. That the said man-mountain shall, in two moons time, deliver in\r\nan exact survey of the circumference of our dominions, by a computation\r\nof his own paces round the coast.\r\n\r\nLastly. That upon his solemn oath to observe all the above articles, the\r\nsaid man-mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat and drink\r\nsufficient for the support of 1724 of our subjects, with free access to\r\nour royal person, and other marks of our favor. Given at our palace at\r\nBelfaborac, the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon of our reign.\r\n\r\nI swore and subscribed to the articles with great cheerfulness and\r\ncontent, although some of them were not so honorable as I could have\r\nwished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of Skyrris Bolgolam, the\r\nhigh admiral; whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was\r\nat full liberty. The emperor himself in person did me the honor to be by\r\nat the whole ceremony. I made my acknowledgments, by prostrating myself\r\nat his majesty's feet: but he commanded me to rise; and after many\r\ngracious expressions, which, to avoid the censure of vanity, I shall not\r\nrepeat, he added, that he hoped I should prove a useful servant, and\r\nwell deserve all the favors he had already conferred upon me, or might\r\ndo for the future.\r\n\r\nThe reader may please to observe, that, in the last article for the\r\nrecovery of my liberty, the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity of\r\nmeat and drink sufficient for the support of 1724 Lilliputians. Some\r\ntime after, asking a friend at court, how they came to fix on that\r\ndeterminate number, he told me, that his majesty's mathematicians having\r\ntaken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant,[22] and finding\r\nit to exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one, they concluded,\r\nfrom the similarity of their bodies, that mine must contain at least\r\n1724 of theirs, and consequently would require as much food as was\r\nnecessary to support that number of Lilliputians. By which the reader\r\nmay conceive an idea of the ingenuity of that people, as well as the\r\nprudent and exact economy of so great a prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     MILENDO, THE METROPOLIS OF LILLIPUT, DESCRIBED TOGETHER WITH THE\r\n     EMPEROR'S PALACE. A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND A PRINCIPAL\r\n     SECRETARY, CONCERNING THE AFFAIRS OF THAT EMPIRE. THE AUTHOR OFFERS\r\n     TO SERVE THE EMPEROR IN HIS WARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first request I made, after I had obtained my liberty, was, that I\r\nmight have license to see Milendo, the metropolis; which the emperor\r\neasily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt, either to\r\nthe inhabitants or their houses. The people had notice, by proclamation,\r\nof my design to visit the town.\r\n\r\nThe wall, which encompassed it, is two feet and a half high, and at\r\nleast eleven inches broad, so that a coach and horses may be driven very\r\nsafely round it; and it is flanked with strong towers at ten feet\r\ndistance. I stept over the great western gate, and passed very gently,\r\nand sideling, through the two principal streets, only in my short\r\nwaistcoat, for fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the houses with\r\nthe skirts[23] of my coat. I walked with the utmost circumspection, to\r\navoid treading on any stragglers who might remain in the streets;\r\nalthough the orders were very strict, that all people should keep in\r\ntheir houses at their own peril. The garret-windows and tops of houses\r\nwere so crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels I had\r\nnot seen a more populous place.\r\n\r\nThe city is an exact square, each side of the wall being five hundred\r\nfeet long. The two great streets, which run across and divide it into\r\nfour quarters, are five feet wide. The lanes and alleys, which I could\r\nnot enter, but only viewed them as I passed, are from twelve to eighteen\r\ninches. The town is capable of holding five hundred thousand souls; the\r\nhouses are from three to five stories; the shops and markets well\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nThe emperor's palace is in the centre of the city, where the two great\r\nstreets meet. It is enclosed by a wall of two foot high, and twenty foot\r\ndistant from the buildings. I had his majesty's permission to step over\r\nthis wall; and the space being so wide between that and the palace, I\r\ncould easily view it on every side.\r\n\r\nThe outward court is a square of forty feet, and includes two other\r\ncourts; in the inmost are the royal apartments, which I was very\r\ndesirous to see, but found it extremely difficult; for the great gates\r\nfrom one square into another were but eighteen inches high, and seven\r\ninches wide. Now the buildings of the outer court were at least five\r\nfeet high, and it was impossible for me to stride over them without\r\ninfinite damage to the pile, though the walls were strongly built of\r\nhewn stone, and four inches thick.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the emperor had a great desire that I should see the\r\nmagnificence of his palace; but this I was not able to do till three\r\ndays after, which I spent in cutting down, with my knife, some of the\r\nlargest trees in the royal park, about an hundred yards distance from\r\nthe city. Of these trees I made two stools, each about three feet high,\r\nand strong enough to bear my weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HER IMPERIAL MAJESTY WAS PLEASED TO SMILE VERY GRACIOUSLY\r\nUPON ME\" P. 50.]\r\n\r\nThe people having received notice a second time, I went again through\r\nthe city to the palace, with my two stools in my hands. When I came to\r\nthe side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the other\r\nin my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it down on the\r\nspace between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide. I\r\nthen stept over the building very conveniently, from one stool to the\r\nother, and drew up the first after me with a hooked stick. By this\r\ncontrivance I got into the inmost court; and, lying down upon my side, I\r\napplied my face to the windows of the middle stories, which were left\r\nopen on purpose, and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be\r\nimagined. There I saw the empress and the young princes in their several\r\nlodgings, with their chief attendants about them. Her imperial majesty\r\nwas pleased to smile very graciously upon me, and gave me out of the\r\nwindow her hand to kiss.\r\n\r\nBut I shall not anticipate the reader with farther descriptions of this\r\nkind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now almost\r\nready for the press, containing a general description of this empire,\r\nfrom its first erection, through a long series of princes, with a\r\nparticular account of their wars and politics, laws, learning, and\r\nreligion, their plants and animals, their peculiar manners and customs,\r\nwith other matters very curious and useful; my chief design, at present,\r\nbeing only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the\r\npublic, or to myself, during a residence of about nine months in that\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nOne morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty,\r\nReldresal, principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs,\r\ncame to my house, attended only by one servant. He ordered his coach to\r\nwait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hour's audience;\r\nwhich I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal\r\nmerits, as well as of the many good offices he had done me during my\r\nsolicitations at court. I offered to lie down, that he might the more\r\nconveniently reach my ear; but he chose rather to let me hold him in my\r\nhand during our conversation.\r\n\r\nHe began with compliments on my liberty; said he might pretend to some\r\nmerit in it. But however, added, that if it had not been for the present\r\nsituation of things at court, perhaps I might not have obtained it so\r\nsoon. For, said he, as flourishing a condition as we may appear to be in\r\nto foreigners, we labor under two mighty evils: a violent faction at\r\nhome, and the danger of an invasion, by a most potent enemy, from\r\nabroad. As to the first, you are to understand, that, for above seventy\r\nmoons past, there have been two struggling parties in this empire, under\r\nthe names of _Tramecksan_ and _Slamecksan_, from the high and low heels\r\nof their shoes, by which they distinguish themselves. It is alleged,\r\nindeed, that the high heels are most agreeable to our ancient\r\nconstitution; but, however this may be, his majesty hath determined to\r\nmake use only of low heels in the administration of the government, and\r\nall offices in the gift of the crown, as you cannot but observe: and\r\nparticularly, that his majesty's imperial heels are lower, at least by a\r\n_drurr_, than any of his court (_drurr_ is a measure about the\r\nfourteenth part of an inch). The animosities between these two parties\r\nrun so high, that they will neither eat nor drink nor talk with each\r\nother. We compute the _Tramecksan_, or high heels, to exceed us in\r\nnumber; but the power is wholly on our side. We apprehend his imperial\r\nhighness, the heir to the crown, to have some tendency towards the high\r\nheels; at least, we can plainly discover that one of his heels is higher\r\nthan the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait. Now, in the midst\r\nof these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with an invasion from\r\nthe island of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of the universe,\r\nalmost as large and powerful as this of his majesty. For, as to what we\r\nhave heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and states in the\r\nworld, inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself, our\r\nphilosophers are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that you\r\ndropped from the moon or one of the stars, because it is certain, that\r\nan hundred mortals of your bulk would, in a short time, destroy all the\r\nfruits and cattle of his majesty's dominions. Besides, our histories of\r\nsix thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the two\r\ngreat empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu. Which two mighty powers have, as\r\nI was going to tell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for\r\nsix-and-thirty moons past. It began upon the following occasion: It is\r\nallowed on all hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we\r\neat them, was upon the larger end; but his present majesty's\r\ngrandfather, while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it\r\naccording to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers.\r\nWhereupon the emperor, his father, published an edict, commanding all\r\nhis subjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end of their\r\neggs. The people so highly resented this law, that our histories tell\r\nus, there have been six rebellions raised on that account, wherein one\r\nemperor lost his life, and another his crown. These civil commotions\r\nwere constantly fomented by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and when they\r\nwere quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that empire. It is\r\ncomputed, that eleven thousand persons have, at several times, suffered\r\ndeath, rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end. Many\r\nhundred large volumes have been published upon this controversy, but the\r\nbooks of the Big-endians have been long forbidden, and the whole party\r\nrendered incapable, by law, of holding employments. During the course of\r\nthese troubles, the Emperors of Blefuscu did frequently expostulate, by\r\ntheir ambassadors, accusing us of making a schism in religion, by\r\noffending against a fundamental doctrine of our great prophet Lustrog,\r\nin the fifty-fourth chapter of the Blundecral (which is their\r\nAlcoran)[24] This, however, is thought to be a mere strain upon the\r\ntext; for the words are these: That all true believers break their eggs\r\nat the convenient end. And which is the convenient end, seems, in my\r\nhumble opinion, to be left to every man's conscience, or, at least, in\r\nthe power of the chief magistrate to determine. Now, the Big-endian\r\nexiles have found so much credit in the emperor of Blefuscu's court, and\r\nso much private assistance and encouragement from their party here at\r\nhome, that a bloody war hath been carried on between the two empires for\r\nsix-and-thirty moons, with various success; during which time we have\r\nlost forty capital ships, and a much greater number of smaller vessels,\r\ntogether with thirty thousand of our best seamen and soldiers; and the\r\ndamage received by the enemy is reckoned to be somewhat greater than\r\nours. However, they have now equipped a numerous fleet, and are just\r\npreparing to make a descent upon us; and his imperial majesty, placing\r\ngreat confidence in your valor and strength, hath commanded me to lay\r\nthis account of his affairs before you.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor, and to\r\nlet him know that I thought it would not become me, who was a foreigner,\r\nto interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the hazard of my life,\r\nto defend his person and state against all invaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR, BY AN EXTRAORDINARY STRATAGEM, PREVENTS AN INVASION. A\r\n     HIGH TITLE OF HONOR IS CONFERRED UPON HIM. AMBASSADORS ARRIVE FROM\r\n     THE EMPEROR OF BLEFUSCU, AND SUE FOR PEACE. THE EMPRESS'S APARTMENT\r\n     ON FIRE, BY ACCIDENT; THE AUTHOR INSTRUMENTAL IN SAVING THE REST OF\r\n     THE PALACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe empire of Blefuscu is an island, situate to the north northeast of\r\nLilliput, from whence it is parted only by a channel of eight hundred\r\nyards wide. I had not yet seen it; and upon this notice of an intended\r\ninvasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of\r\nbeing discovered by some of the enemy's ships, who had received no\r\nintelligence of me, all intercourse between the two empires having been\r\nstrictly forbidden during the war, upon the pain of death, and an\r\nembargo[25] laid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI communicated to his majesty a project I had formed, of seizing the\r\nenemy's whole fleet; which, as our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in\r\nthe harbor, ready to sail with the first fair wind. I consulted the most\r\nexperienced seamen upon the depth of the channel, which they had often\r\nplumbed; who told me, that in the middle, at high water, it was seventy\r\n_glumgluffs_ deep, which is about six feet of European measure; and the\r\nrest of it fifty _glumgluffs_ at most. I walked towards the northeast\r\ncoast, over against Blefuscu; where, lying down behind a hillock, I took\r\nout my small perspective glass, and viewed the enemy's fleet at anchor,\r\nconsisting of about fifty men-of-war, and a great number of transports;\r\nI then came back to my house, and gave orders (for which I had a\r\nwarrant) for a great quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron.\r\nThe cable was about as thick as packthread, and the bars of the length\r\nand size of a knitting needle. I trebled the cable, to make it stronger;\r\nand, for the same reason, I twisted three of the iron bars together,\r\nbending the extremities into a hook.\r\n\r\nHaving thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the\r\nnortheast coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked\r\ninto the sea in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before\r\nhigh-water. I waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle\r\nabout thirty yards, till I felt ground; I arrived at the fleet in less\r\nthan half an hour. The enemy were so frightened, when they saw me, that\r\nthey leaped out of their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not\r\nbe fewer than thirty thousand souls: I then took my tackling, and\r\nfastening a hook to the hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords\r\ntogether at the end.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus employed, the enemy discharged several thousand arrows,\r\nmany of which stuck in my hands and face; and, besides the excessive\r\nsmart, gave me much disturbance in my work. My greatest apprehension was\r\nfor mine eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not\r\nsuddenly thought of an expedient. I kept, among other little\r\nnecessaries, a pair of spectacles, in a private pocket, which, as I\r\nobserved before, had escaped the emperor's searchers. These I took out,\r\nand fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed, went\r\non boldly with my work, in spite of the enemy's arrows, many of which\r\nstruck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any other\r\neffect, farther than a little to discompose them.[26] I had now fastened\r\nall the hooks, and, taking the knot in my hand, began to pull: but not a\r\nship would stir, for they were all too fast held by their anchors; so\r\nthat the boldest part of my enterprise remained. I therefore let go the\r\ncord, and, leaving the hooks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with\r\nmy knife the cables that fastened the anchors, receiving above two\r\nhundred shots in my face and hands; then I took up the knotted end of\r\nthe cables, to which my hooks were tied, and, with great ease, drew\r\nfifty of the enemy's largest men-of-war after me.\r\n\r\nThe Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended,\r\nwere at first confounded with astonishment. They had seen me cut the\r\ncables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift, or\r\nfall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole fleet moving\r\nin order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of\r\ngrief and despair as it is almost impossible to describe or conceive.\r\nWhen I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows\r\nthat stuck in my hands and face: and rubbed on some of the same ointment\r\nthat was given me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned. I\r\nthen took off my spectacles, and waiting about an hour, till the tide\r\nwas a little fallen, I waded through the middle with my cargo, and\r\narrived safe at the royal port of Lilliput.\r\n\r\nThe emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting the issue\r\nof this great adventure. They saw the ships move forward in a large\r\nhalf-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.\r\nWhen I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet more in\r\npain, because I was under water to my neck. The emperor concluded me to\r\nbe drowned, and that the enemy's fleet was approaching in an hostile\r\nmanner: but he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing\r\nshallower every step I made, I came in a short time within hearing; and\r\nholding up the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I\r\ncried in a loud voice, Long live the most puissant[27] emperor of\r\nLilliput! This great prince received me at my landing, with all possible\r\nencomiums, and created me a _nardac_ upon the spot, which is the highest\r\ntitle of honor among them.\r\n\r\nHis majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all\r\nthe rest of his enemy's ships into his ports. And so immeasurable is the\r\nambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than\r\nreducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it\r\nby viceroy; of destroying the Big-endian exiles, and compelling that\r\npeople to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain\r\nthe sole monarch of the whole world. But I endeavored to divert him from\r\nthis design, by many arguments, drawn from the topics of policy, as well\r\nas justice. And I plainly protested, that I would never be an instrument\r\nof bringing a free and brave people into slavery. And when the matter\r\nwas debated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were of my\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"AND CREATED ME A _NARDAC_ UPON THE SPOT.\" P. 58.]\r\n\r\nThis open, bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes and\r\npolitics of his imperial majesty, that he could never forgive me; he\r\nmentioned it, in a very artful manner, at council, where, I was told,\r\nthat some of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to be of my\r\nopinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear some\r\nexpressions, which by a side-wind reflected on me. And, from this time\r\nbegan an intrigue between his majesty and a junto[28] of ministers\r\nmaliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than two months,\r\nand had like to have ended in my utter destruction. Of so little weight\r\nare the greatest services to princes, when put into the balance with a\r\nrefusal to gratify their passions.\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy\r\nfrom Blefuscu, with humble offers of peace; which was soon concluded,\r\nupon conditions very advantageous to our emperor, wherewith I shall not\r\ntrouble the reader. There were six ambassadors, with a train of about\r\nfive hundred persons; and their entry was very magnificent, suitable to\r\nthe grandeur of their master, and the importance of their business. When\r\ntheir treaty was finished, wherein I did them several good offices, by\r\nthe credit I now had, or at least appeared to have at court, their\r\nexcellencies, who were privately told how much I had been their friend,\r\nmade me a visit in form. They began with many compliments upon my valor\r\nand generosity, invited me to that kingdom, in the emperor their\r\nmaster's name, and desired me to show some proofs of my prodigious\r\nstrength, of which they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily\r\nobliged them, but shall not trouble the reader with the particulars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen I had for some time entertained their Excellencies, to their\r\ninfinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the honor\r\nto present my most humble respects to the emperor their master, the\r\nrenown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with\r\nadmiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend, before I\r\nreturned to my own country. Accordingly, the next time I had the honor\r\nto see our emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the\r\nBlefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could\r\nplainly perceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the reason,\r\ntill I had a whisper from a certain person, that Flimnap and Bolgolam\r\nhad represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a mark of\r\ndisaffection, from which, I am sure, my heart was wholly free. And this\r\nwas the first time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of courts and\r\nministers.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me by an\r\ninterpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each\r\nother as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the\r\nantiquity, beauty, and energy of its own tongue, with an avowed contempt\r\nfor that of its neighbor; yet our emperor, standing upon the advantage\r\nhe had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them to deliver their\r\ncredentials, and make their speech in the Lilliputian tongue.\r\n\r\nAnd it must be confessed, that, from the great intercourse of trade and\r\ncommerce between both realms; from the continual reception of exiles,\r\nwhich is mutual among them; and from the custom in each empire, to send\r\ntheir young nobility, and richer gentry, to the other, in order to\r\npolish themselves, by seeing the world, and understanding men and\r\nmanners; there are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or, seamen,\r\nwho dwell in the maritime parts, but what can hold conversation in both\r\ntongues, as I found some weeks after, when I went to pay my respects to\r\nthe Emperor of Blefuscu, which, in the midst of great misfortunes,\r\nthrough the malice of my enemies, proved a very happy adventure to me,\r\nas I shall relate in its proper place.\r\n\r\nThe reader may remember, that when I signed those articles, upon which I\r\nrecovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked, upon account of\r\ntheir being too servile; neither could anything but an extreme necessity\r\nhave forced me to submit. But, being now a _nardac_ of the highest rank\r\nin that empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and\r\nthe emperor, to do him justice, never once mentioned them to me.\r\nHowever, it was not long before I had an opportunity of doing his\r\nmajesty, at least as I then thought, a most signal service. I was\r\nalarmed at midnight with the cries of many hundred people at my door, by\r\nwhich, being suddenly awaked, I was in some kind of terror. I heard the\r\nword _burglum_ repeated incessantly.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the emperor's court, making their way through the crowd,\r\nentreated me to come immediately to the palace, where her imperial\r\nmajesty's apartment was on fire, by the carelessness of a maid of honor,\r\nwho fell asleep while she was reading a romance. I got up in an instant;\r\nand orders being given to clear the way before me, and it being likewise\r\na moonshine night, I made a shift to get to the palace, without\r\ntrampling on any of the people. I found they had already applied ladders\r\nto the walls of the apartment, and were well provided with buckets, but\r\nthe water was at some distance. These buckets were about the size of a\r\nlarge thimble, and the poor people supplied me with them as fast as they\r\ncould; but the flame was so violent that they did little good. I might\r\neasily have stifled it with my coat, which I unfortunately left behind\r\nme for haste, and came away only in my leathern jerkin. The case seemed\r\nwholly desperate and deplorable, and this magnificent palace would have\r\ninfallibly been burnt down to the ground, if, by a presence of mind\r\nunusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an expedient by which in\r\nthree minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and the rest of that\r\nnoble pile, which had cost so many ages in erecting, preserved from\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was now daylight, and I returned to my house, without waiting to\r\ncongratulate with the emperor; because, although I had done a very\r\neminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his majesty might\r\nresent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental\r\nlaws of the realm, it is capital in any man, of what quality soever, to\r\neven touch the empress or the royal princesses without invitation. But I\r\nwas a little comforted by a message from his majesty, that he would give\r\norders to the grand justiciary for passing my pardon in form, which,\r\nhowever, I could not obtain. And I was privately assured that the\r\nempress, conceiving the greatest abhorrence of me, and, in the presence\r\nof her chief confidants, could not forbear vowing revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     OF THE INHABITANTS OF LILLIPUT; THEIR LEARNING, LAWS, AND CUSTOMS;\r\n     THE MANNER OF EDUCATING THEIR CHILDREN. THE AUTHOR'S WAY OF LIVING\r\n     IN THAT COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I intend to leave the description of this empire to a\r\nparticular treatise, yet, in the meantime, I am content to gratify the\r\ncurious reader with some general ideas. As the common size of the\r\nnatives is somewhat under six inches high, so there is an exact\r\nproportion in all other animals, as well as plants and trees: for\r\ninstance, the tallest horses and oxen are between four and five inches\r\nin height, the sheep an inch and a half, more or less; their geese about\r\nthe bigness of a sparrow, and so the several gradations downwards, till\r\nyou come to the smallest, which, to my sight, were almost invisible; but\r\nnature hath adapted the eyes of the Lilliputians to all objects proper\r\nfor their view; they see with great exactness, but at no great distance.\r\nAnd, to show the sharpness of their sight, towards objects that are\r\nnear, I have been much pleased with observing a cook pulling[29] a lark,\r\nwhich was not so large as a common fly; and a young girl threading an\r\ninvisible needle with invisible silk.\r\n\r\nTheir tallest trees are about seven feet high; I mean some of those in\r\nthe great royal park, the tops whereof I could but just reach with my\r\nfist clenched. The other vegetables are in the same proportion; but this\r\nI leave to the reader's imagination.\r\n\r\nI shall say but little at present of their learning, which, for many\r\nages, hath flourished in all its branches among them: but their manner\r\nof writing is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the right\r\nlike the Europeans; nor from the right to the left, like the Arabians;\r\nnor from up to down, like the Chinese, but aslant, from one corner of\r\nthe paper to the other, like ladies in England.\r\n\r\nThey bury their dead with their heads directly downwards, because they\r\nhold an opinion, that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise\r\nagain, in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will\r\nturn upside down, and by this means they shall, at the resurrection, be\r\nfound ready, standing on their feet. The learned among them confess the\r\nabsurdity of this doctrine, but the practice still continues, in\r\ncompliance to the vulgar.\r\n\r\nThere are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and, if\r\nthey were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country, I\r\nshould be tempted to say a little in their justification. It is only to\r\nbe wished they were as well executed. The first I shall mention relates\r\nto informers. All crimes against the state are punished here with the\r\nutmost severity; but, if the person accused maketh his innocence plainly\r\nto appear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately put to an\r\nignominious death; and, out of his goods, or lands, the innocent person\r\nis quadruply recompensed for the loss of his time, for the danger he\r\nunderwent, for the hardship of his imprisonment, and for all the charges\r\nhe hath been at in making his defence, or, it that fund be deficient,\r\nit is largely supplied by the crown. The emperor also confers on him\r\nsome public mark of his favor, and proclamation is made of his innocence\r\nthrough the whole city.\r\n\r\nThey look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore seldom\r\nfail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and vigilance,\r\nwith a very common understanding, may preserve a man's goods from\r\nthieves, but honesty has no fence against superior cunning; and, since\r\nit is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of buying\r\nand selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is permitted and\r\nconnived at, or hath no law to punish it, the honest dealer is always\r\nundone, and the knave gets the advantage. I remember, when I was once\r\ninterceding with the king for a criminal, who had wronged his master of\r\na great sum of money, which he had received by order, and run away with,\r\nand happening to tell his majesty, by way of extenuation, that it was\r\nonly a breach of trust, the emperor thought it monstrous in me, to offer\r\nas a defence the greatest aggravation of the crime; and, truly, I had\r\nlittle to say in return, farther than the common answer, that different\r\nnations had different customs; for, I confess, I was heartily ashamed.\r\n\r\nAlthough we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which\r\nall government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be put in\r\npractice by any nation except that of Lilliput. Whoever can there bring\r\nsufficient proof that he hath strictly observed the laws of his country\r\nfor seventy-three moons, hath a claim to certain privileges, according\r\nto his quality and condition of life, with a proportionable sum of out\r\nof a fund appropriated for that use; he likewise acquires the title of\r\n_snillpall_, or _legal_, which is added to his name, but doth not\r\ndescend to his posterity. And these people thought it a prodigious\r\ndefect of policy among us, when I told them that our laws were enforced\r\nonly by penalties, without any mention of reward. It is upon this\r\naccount that the image of Justice, in their courts of judicature, is\r\nformed with six eyes, two before, as many behind, and on each side one,\r\nto signify circumspection, with a bag of gold open in her right hand,\r\nand a sword sheath in her left, to show she was more disposed to reward\r\nthan to punish.\r\n\r\nIn choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to good\r\nmorals than to great abilities; for, since government is necessary to\r\nmankind, they believe that the common size of human understanding is\r\nfitted to some station or other, and that Providence never intended to\r\nmake the management of public affairs a mystery, to be comprehended only\r\nby a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born\r\nin an age; but they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like, to\r\nbe in every man's power, the practice of which virtues, assisted by\r\nexperience, and a good intention, would qualify any man for the service\r\nof his country, except where a course of study is required. But they\r\nthought the want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by\r\nsuperior endowments of the mind, that employments could never be put\r\ninto such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and at\r\nleast, that the mistakes committed by ignorance, in a virtuous\r\ndisposition, would never be of such fatal consequences to the public\r\nweal as the practices of a man whose inclinations led him to be corrupt,\r\nand who had great abilities to manage, to multiply, and defend his\r\ncorruptions.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man\r\nincapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow\r\nthemselves to be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think\r\nnothing can be more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as\r\ndisown the authority under which he acts.\r\n\r\nIn relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood to\r\nmean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous corruptions\r\ninto which these people are fallen, by the degenerate nature of man.\r\nFor, as to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by\r\ndancing on the ropes, or badges of favor and distinction by leaping over\r\nsticks, and creeping under them, the reader is to observe, that they\r\nwere first introduced by the grandfather of the emperor, now reigning,\r\nand grew to the present height by the gradual increase of party and\r\nfaction.\r\n\r\nIngratitude is, among them, a capital crime, as we read it to have been\r\nin some other countries; for they reason thus, that whoever makes ill\r\nreturns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of\r\nmankind, from whom he hath received no obligation, and therefore such a\r\nman is not fit to live.\r\n\r\nTheir notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ\r\nextremely from ours. Their opinion is, that parents are the last of all\r\nothers to be trusted with the education of their own children; and,\r\ntherefore, they have, in every town, public nurseries, where all\r\nparents, except cottagers and laborers, are obliged to send their\r\ninfants of both sexes to be reared and educated, when they come to the\r\nage of twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some\r\nrudiments of docility. These schools are of several kinds, suited to\r\ndifferent qualities, and to both sexes. They have certain professors,\r\nwell skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as\r\nbefits the rank of their parents, and their own capacities as well as\r\ninclinations. I shall first say something of the male nurseries, and\r\nthen of the female.\r\n\r\nThe nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth are provided with\r\ngrave and learned professors, and their several deputies. The clothes\r\nand food of the children are plain and simple. They are bred up in the\r\nprinciples of honor, justice, courage, modesty, clemency, religion, and\r\nlove of their country; they are always employed in some business, except\r\nin the times of eating and sleeping, which are very short, and two hours\r\nfor diversions, consisting of bodily exercises. They are dressed by men\r\ntill four years of age, and then are obliged to dress themselves,\r\nalthough their quality be ever so great; and the women attendants, who\r\nare aged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only the most menial\r\noffices. They are never suffered to converse with servants, but go\r\ntogether in smaller or greater numbers to take their diversions, and\r\nalways in the presence of a professor, or one of his deputies; whereby\r\nthey avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice, to which our\r\nchildren are subject. Their parents are suffered to see them only twice\r\na year; the visit to last but an hour; they are allowed to kiss the\r\nchild at meeting and parting; but a professor, who always stands by on\r\nthose occasions, will not suffer them to whisper, or use any fondling\r\nexpressions, or bring any presents of toys, sweetmeats, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe pension from each family, for the education and entertainment of a\r\nchild, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the emperor's officers.\r\n\r\nThe nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants, traders,\r\nand handicrafts, are managed proportionally after the same manner; only\r\nthose designed for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old,\r\nwhereas those persons of quality continue in their exercises till\r\nfifteen, which answers to twenty-one with us; but the confinement is\r\ngradually lessened for the last three years.\r\n\r\nIn the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated much\r\nlike the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own\r\nsex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy, till they come\r\nto dress themselves, which is at five years old. And if it be found that\r\nthese nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or\r\nfoolish stories, or the common follies practised by the chambermaids\r\namong us, they are publicly whipped thrice about the city, imprisoned\r\nfor a year, and banished for life to the most desolate part of the\r\ncountry. Thus, the young ladies there are as much ashamed of being\r\ncowards and fools as the men, and despise all personal ornaments beyond\r\ndecency and cleanliness: neither did I perceive any difference in their\r\neducation, made by their difference of sex, only that the exercises of\r\nthe women were not altogether so robust, and that some rules were given\r\nthem relating to domestic life, and a smaller compass of learning was\r\nenjoined them: for their maxim is that, among people of quality, a wife\r\nshould be always a reasonable and agreeable companion, because she\r\ncannot always be young. When the girls are twelve years old, which\r\namong them is the marriageable age, their parents or guardians take\r\nthem home, with great expressions of gratitude to the professors, and\r\nseldom without tears of the young lady and her companions.\r\n\r\nIn the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are\r\ninstructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex and their several\r\ndegrees; those intended for apprentices are dismissed at seven years\r\nold, the rest are kept to eleven.\r\n\r\nThe meaner[30] families who have children at these nurseries are\r\nobliged, besides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to\r\nreturn to the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their\r\ngettings, to be a portion[31] for the child; and, therefore, all parents\r\nare limited in their expenses by the law. For the Lilliputians think\r\nnothing can be more unjust than for people to leave the burden of\r\nsupporting their children on the public. As to persons of quality, they\r\ngive security to appropriate a certain sum for each child, suitable to\r\ntheir condition; and these funds are always managed with good husbandry\r\nand the most exact justice.\r\n\r\nThe cottagers and laborers keep their children at home, their business\r\nbeing only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore their\r\neducation is of little consequence to the public; but the old and\r\ndiseased among them are supported by hospitals; for begging is a trade\r\nunknown in this empire.\r\n\r\nAnd here it may perhaps divert the curious reader to give some account\r\nof my domestic,[32] and my manner of living in this country, during a\r\nresidence of nine months and thirteen days. Having a head for\r\nmechanics, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself\r\na table and chair, convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the\r\nroyal park. Two hundred seamtresses were employed to make me shirts,\r\nand linen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind\r\nthey could get; which, however, they were forced to quilt together in\r\nseveral folds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn. Their\r\nlinen is usually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece.\r\n\r\nThe seamtresses took my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at\r\nmy neck, and another at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended that\r\neach held by the end, while a third measured the length of the cord with\r\na rule of an inch long. Then they measured my right thumb, and desired\r\nno more; for, by a mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb\r\nis once round the wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the\r\nhelp of my old shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a\r\npattern, they fitted me exactly. Three hundred tailors were employed in\r\nthe same manner to make me clothes; but they had another contrivance for\r\ntaking my measure. I kneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the\r\nground to my neck; upon this ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a\r\nplumb-line from my collar to the floor, which just answered the length\r\nof my coat; but my waist and arms I measured myself. When my clothes\r\nwere finished, which was done in my house (for the largest of theirs\r\nwould not have been able to hold them), they looked like the patchwork\r\nmade by the ladies in England, only that mine were all of a color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THREE HUNDRED TAILORS WERE EMPLOYED TO MAKE ME CLOTHES\"\r\nP. 74.]\r\n\r\nI had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient\r\nhuts built about my house, where they and their families lived, and\r\nprepared me two dishes a-piece. I took up twenty waiters in my hand, and\r\nplaced them on the table; an hundred more attended below on the ground,\r\nsome with dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine and other\r\nliquors, flung on their shoulders; all of which the waiters above drew\r\nup, as I wanted, in a very ingenious manner, by certain cords, as we\r\ndraw the bucket up a well in Europe. A dish of their meat was a good\r\nmouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught. Their\r\nmutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent, I have had a sirloin\r\nso large that I have been forced to make three bites of it; but this is\r\nrare. My servants were astonished to see me eat it, bones and all, as in\r\nour country we do the leg of a lark. Their geese and turkeys I usually\r\neat at a mouthful, and I must confess they far exceed ours. Of their\r\nsmaller fowl, I could take up twenty or thirty at the end of my knife.\r\n\r\nOne day his imperial majesty, being informed of my way of living,\r\ndesired that himself and his royal consort, with the young princes of\r\nthe blood of both sexes, might have the happiness, as he was pleased to\r\ncall it, of dining with me. They came accordingly, and I placed them in\r\nchairs of state upon my table, just over against me, with their guards\r\nabout them. Flimnap, the lord high treasurer, attended there likewise,\r\nwith his white staff; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour\r\ncountenance, which I would not seem to regard, but eat more than usual,\r\nin honor to my dear country, as well as to fill the court with\r\nadmiration. I have some private reasons to believe that this visit from\r\nhis majesty gave Flimnap an opportunity of doing me ill offices to his\r\nmaster. That minister had always been my secret enemy, though he\r\noutwardly caressed me more than was usual to the moroseness of his\r\nnature. He represented to the emperor the low condition of his treasury;\r\nthat he was forced to take up money at a great discount; that exchequer\r\nbills[33] would not circulate under nine per cent, below par; that I had\r\ncost his majesty above a million and a half of _sprugs_ (their greatest\r\ngold coin, about the bigness of a spangle); and, upon the whole, that it\r\nwould be advisable in the emperor to take the first fair occasion of\r\ndismissing me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE HAPPINESS ... OF DINING WITH ME.\" P. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR, BEING INFORMED OF A DESIGN TO ACCUSE HIM OF HIGH\r\n     TREASON, MAKES HIS ESCAPE TO BLEFUSCU. HIS RECEPTION THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may\r\nbe proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for\r\ntwo months forming against me.\r\n\r\nI had been hitherto all my life a stranger to courts, for which I was\r\nunqualified by the meanness of my condition. I had indeed heard and read\r\nenough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers, but never\r\nexpected to have found such terrible effects of them in so remote a\r\ncountry, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims from those in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nWhen I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of\r\nBlefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very\r\nserviceable, at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his\r\nimperial majesty) came to my house very privately at night, in a close\r\nchair,[34] and without sending his name, desired admittance. The\r\nchairmen were dismissed; I put the chair, with his lordship in it, into\r\nmy coat-pocket; and, giving orders to a trusty servant to say I was\r\nindisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed\r\nthe chair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by\r\nit. After the common salutations were over, observing his lordship's\r\ncountenance full of concern, and inquiring into the reason, he desired I\r\nwould hear him with patience, in a matter that highly concerned my honor\r\nand my life. His speech was to the following effect, for I took notes of\r\nit as soon as he left me:--\r\n\r\nYou are to know, said he, that several committees of council have been\r\nlately called in the most private manner on your account; and it is but\r\ntwo days since his majesty came to a full resolution.\r\n\r\nYou are very sensible that Skyrris Bolgolam (_galbet_ or high-admiral)\r\nhath been your mortal enemy almost ever since your arrival: his original\r\nreasons I know not; but his hatred is increased since your great success\r\nagainst Blefuscu, by which his glory, as admiral, is much obscured. This\r\nlord, in conjunction with Flimnap the high treasurer, whose enmity\r\nagainst you is notorious, Limtoc the general, Lalcon the chamberlain,\r\nand Balmuff the grand justiciary, have prepared articles of impeachment\r\nagainst you, for treason, and other capital crimes.\r\n\r\nThis preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own merits and\r\ninnocence, that I was going to interrupt; when he entreated me to be\r\nsilent, and thus proceeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"HE DESIRED I WOULD HEAR HIM WITH PATIENCE.\" P. 80.]\r\n\r\nOut of gratitude for the favors you have done for me, I procured\r\ninformation of the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles;\r\nwherein I venture my head for your service.\r\n\r\nARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST QUINBUS FLESTRIN, THE MAN-MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.\r\n\r\n     Whereas, by a statute made in the reign of his Imperial Majesty\r\n     Calin Deffar Plune, it is enacted, That whoever shall lay hands\r\n     upon the empress, or upon any of the royal children, shall be\r\n     liable to the pains and penalties of high treason. Notwithstanding,\r\n     the said Quinbus Flestrin, in open breach of the said law, under\r\n     color of extinguishing the fire kindled in the apartment of his\r\n     Majesty's most dear imperial consort, did maliciously, and\r\n     traitorously, pull her by the arms, and lift her high in the air in\r\n     both his hands, against the statute in that case provided, &c.,\r\n     against the duty, &c.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE II.\r\n\r\n     That the said Quinbus Flestrin, having brought the imperial fleet\r\n     of Blefuscu into the royal port, and being afterwards commanded by\r\n     his imperial majesty to seize all the other ships of the said\r\n     empire of Blefuscu, and reduce that empire to a province, to be\r\n     governed by a viceroy from hence, and to destroy and put to death,\r\n     not only all the Big-endian exiles, but likewise all the people of\r\n     that empire who would not immediately forsake the Big-endian\r\n     heresy. He, the said Flestrin, like a false traitor against his\r\n     most auspicious, serene, imperial majesty, did petition to be\r\n     excused from the said service, upon pretence of unwillingness to\r\n     force the consciences or destroy the liberties and lives of an\r\n     innocent people.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE III.\r\n\r\n     That, whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the court of\r\n     Blefuscu, to sue for peace in his majesty's court; he, the said\r\n     Flestrin, did, like a false traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and divert\r\n     the said ambassadors, although he knew them to be servants to a\r\n     prince who was lately an open enemy to his imperial majesty, and in\r\n     open war against his said majesty.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE IV.\r\n\r\n     That the said Quinbus Flestrin, contrary to the duty of a faithful\r\n     subject, is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire\r\n     of Blefuscu, for which he hath received only verbal license from\r\n     his imperial majesty; and under color of the said license, doth\r\n     falsely and traitorously intend to take the said voyage, and\r\n     thereby to aid, comfort, and abet the emperor of Blefuscu, so late\r\n     an enemy, and in open war with his imperial majesty aforesaid.\r\n\r\nThere are some other articles, but these are the most important, of\r\nwhich I have read you an abstract.\r\n\r\nIn the several debates upon this impeachment, it must be confessed that\r\nhis majesty gave many marks of his great lenity, often urging the\r\nservices you had done him, and endeavoring to extenuate your crimes. The\r\ntreasurer and admiral insisted that you should be put to the most\r\npainful and ignominious death, by setting fire on your house at night;\r\nand the general was to attend, with twenty thousand men armed with\r\npoisoned arrows, to shoot you on the face and hands. Some of your\r\nservants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on your\r\nshirts and sheets, which would soon make you tear your own flesh, and\r\ndie in the utmost torture. The general came into the same opinion; so\r\nthat for a long time there was a majority against you: but his majesty\r\nresolving, if possible, to spare your life, at last brought off the\r\nchamberlain.\r\n\r\nUpon this incident, Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs,\r\nwho always approved himself your true friend, was commanded by the\r\nemperor to deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and therein\r\njustified the good thoughts you have of him. He allowed your crimes to\r\nbe great, but that still there was room for mercy, the most commendable\r\nvirtue in a prince, and for which his majesty was so justly celebrated.\r\nHe said, the friendship between you and him was so well known to the\r\nworld, that perhaps the most honorable board might think him partial;\r\nhowever, in obedience to the command he had received, he would freely\r\noffer his sentiments; that if his majesty, in consideration of your\r\nservices, and pursuant to his own merciful disposition, would please to\r\nspare your life, and only give orders to put out both your eyes, he\r\nhumbly conceived that, by this expedient, justice might in some measure\r\nbe satisfied, and all the world would applaud the lenity of the emperor,\r\nas well as the fair and generous proceedings of those who have the honor\r\nto be his counsellors: that the loss of your eyes would be no impediment\r\nto your bodily strength, by which you might still be useful to his\r\nmajesty: that blindness is an addition to courage, by concealing dangers\r\nfrom us: that the fear you had for your eyes was the greatest difficulty\r\nin bringing over the enemy's fleet: and it would be sufficient for you\r\nto see by the eyes of the ministers, since the greatest princes do no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the whole\r\nboard. Bolgolam, the admiral, could not preserve his temper, but rising\r\nup in fury, said he wondered how the secretary durst presume to give his\r\nopinion for preserving the life of a traitor: that the services you had\r\nperformed were, by all true reasons of state, the great aggravation of\r\nyour crimes: that you, who extinguished the fire in that unprincipled\r\nmanner, might at another time inundate and drown the whole palace; and\r\nthe same strength, which enabled you to bring over the enemy's fleet,\r\nmight serve, upon the first discontent, to carry it back: that he had\r\ngood reasons to think you were a Big-endian in your heart; and, as\r\ntreason begins in the heart, before it appears in overt acts, so he\r\naccused you as a traitor on that account, and therefore insisted you\r\nshould be put to death.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer was of the same opinion. He showed to what straits his\r\nmajesty's revenue was reduced, by the charge of maintaining you, which\r\nwould soon grow insupportable. That the secretary's expedient of putting\r\nout your eyes was so far from being a remedy against this evil, that it\r\nwould probably increase it, as is manifest from the common practice of\r\nblinding some sort of fowls, after which they fed the faster, and grew\r\nsooner fat. That his sacred majesty, and the council, who are your\r\njudges, were to their own consciences fully convinced of your guilt,\r\nwhich was a sufficient argument to condemn you to death without the\r\nformal proofs required by the strict letter of the law.\r\n\r\nBut his imperial majesty, fully determined against capital punishment,\r\nwas graciously pleaded to say, that since the council thought the loss\r\nof your eyes too easy a censure, some other might be inflicted\r\nhereafter. And your friend, the secretary, humbly desiring to be heard\r\nagain, in answer to what the treasurer had objected concerning the great\r\ncharge his majesty was at in maintaining you, said that his excellency,\r\nwho had the sole disposal of the emperor's revenue, might easily provide\r\nagainst that evil, by gradually lessening your establishment; by which,\r\nfor want of sufficient food, you would grow weak and faint, and lose\r\nyour appetite, and consume in a few months; neither would the stench of\r\nyour carcase be then so dangerous when it should become more than half\r\ndiminished; and, immediately upon your death, five or six thousand of\r\nhis majesty's subjects might in two or three days cut your flesh from\r\nyour bones, take it away by cart-loads, and bury it in distant parts, to\r\nprevent infection, leaving the skeleton as a monument of admiration to\r\nposterity.\r\n\r\nThus, by the great friendship of the secretary, the whole affair was\r\ncompromised. It was strictly enjoined that the project of starving you\r\nby degrees should be kept a secret, but the sentence of putting out your\r\neyes was entered on the books, none dissenting except Bolgolam, the\r\nadmiral, who, being a creature of the empress, was perpetually\r\ninstigated by her majesty to insist upon your death, she having borne\r\nperpetual malice against you, on account of that illegal method you took\r\nto remove her and her children the night of the fire.\r\n\r\nIn three days, your friend the secretary will be directed to come to\r\nyour house and read before you the articles of impeachment; and then to\r\nsignify the great lenity and favor of his majesty and council, whereby\r\nyou are only condemned to the loss of your eyes, which his majesty doth\r\nnot question you will gratefully and humbly submit to; and twenty of his\r\nmajesty's surgeons will attend, in order to see the operation well\r\nperformed, by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows into the balls of\r\nyour eyes as you lie on the ground.\r\n\r\nI leave to your prudence what measures you will take; and, to avoid\r\nsuspicion, I must immediately return, in as private a manner as I came.\r\n\r\nHis lordship did so, and I remained alone, under many doubts and\r\nperplexities of mind.\r\n\r\nIt was a custom, introduced by this prince and his ministry (very\r\ndifferent, as I have been assured, from the practices of former times),\r\nthat after the court had decreed any cruel execution either to gratify\r\nthe monarch's resentment or the malice of a favorite, the emperor always\r\nmade a speech to his whole council, expressing his great lenity and\r\ntenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all the world. This\r\nspeech was immediately published through the kingdom; nor did anything\r\nterrify the people so much as those encomiums on his majesty's mercy;\r\nbecause it was observed that, the more these praises were enlarged and\r\ninsisted on, the more inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer more\r\ninnocent. Yet, as to myself, I must confess, having never been designed\r\nfor a courtier, either by my birth or education, I was so ill a judge of\r\nthings that I could not discover the lenity and favor of this sentence,\r\nbut conceived it (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous than\r\ngentle, I sometimes thought of standing my trial; for although I could\r\nnot deny the facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped they\r\nwould admit of some extenuation. But having in my life perused many\r\nstate-trials, which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought\r\nfit to direct, I durst not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so\r\ncritical a juncture, and against such powerful enemies. Once I was\r\nstrongly bent upon resistance, for, while I had liberty, the whole\r\nstrength of that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with\r\nstones pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project\r\nwith horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the emperor, the\r\nfavors I received from him, and the high title of _nardac_ he conferred\r\nupon me. Neither had I so soon learned the gratitude of courtiers as to\r\npersuade myself that his majesty's present seventies acquitted me of all\r\npast obligations.\r\n\r\nAt last I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may incur\r\nsome censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the preserving mine\r\neyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great rashness and want of\r\nexperience; because if I had then known the nature of princes and\r\nministers, which I have since observed in many other courts, and their\r\nmethods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself, I should with\r\ngreat alacrity and readiness have submitted to so easy a punishment.\r\nBut, hurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his imperial\r\nmajesty's license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu, I\r\ntook this opportunity, before the three days were elapsed, to send a\r\nletter to my friend the secretary, signifying my resolution of setting\r\nout that morning for Blefuscu pursuant to the leave I had got; and,\r\nwithout waiting for an answer, I went to that side of the island where\r\nour fleet lay. I seized a large man-of-war, tied a cable to the prow,\r\nand lifting up the anchors, I stript myself, put my clothes (together\r\nwith my coverlet, which I carried under my arm) into the vessel, and\r\ndrawing it after me, between wading and swimming arrived at the royal\r\nport of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me; they lent me\r\ntwo guides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name.\r\nI held them in my hands until I came within two hundred yards of the\r\ngate, and desired them to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries,\r\nand let him know I there waited his majesty's command. I had an answer\r\nin about an hour, that his majesty, attended by the royal family and\r\ngreat officers of the court, was coming out to receive me. I advanced a\r\nhundred yards. The emperor and his train alighted from their horses, the\r\nempress and ladies from their coaches, and I did not perceive they were\r\nin any fright or concern. I lay on the ground to kiss his majesty's and\r\nthe empress's hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI told his majesty that I was come, according to my promise, and with\r\nthe license of the emperor, my master, to have the honor of seeing so\r\nmighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my power consistent\r\nwith my duty to my own prince, not mentioning a word of my disgrace,\r\nbecause I had hitherto no regular information of it, and might suppose\r\nmyself wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I reasonably\r\nconceive that the emperor would discover the secret while I was out of\r\nhis power, wherein however it soon appeared I was deceived.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my\r\nreception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so\r\ngreat a prince; nor of the difficulties I was in for want of a house and\r\nbed, being forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR, BY A LUCKY ACCIDENT, FINDS MEANS TO LEAVE BLEFUSCU, AND\r\n     AFTER SOME DIFFICULTIES, RETURNS SAFE TO HIS NATIVE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the northeast\r\ncoast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea,\r\nsomewhat that looked like a boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and\r\nstockings, and wading two or three hundred yards, I found the object to\r\napproach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a\r\nreal boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from\r\na ship: whereupon I returned immediately towards the city, and desired\r\nhis imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had\r\nleft after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen under the\r\ncommand of his vice-admiral. This fleet sailed round, while I went back\r\nthe shortest way to the coast, where I first discovered the boat. I\r\nfound the tide had driven it still nearer. The seamen were all provided\r\nwith cordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength.\r\nWhen the ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within\r\na hundred yards of the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got\r\nup to it. The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a\r\nhole in the forepart of the boat, and the other end to a man-of-war. But\r\nI found all my labor to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I\r\nwas not able to work. In this necessity, I was forced to swim behind,\r\nand push the boat forwards as often as I could with one of my hands,\r\nand, the tide favoring me, I advanced so far, that I could just hold up\r\nmy chin and feel the ground. I rested two or three minutes, and then\r\ngave the boat another shove, and so on till the sea was no higher than\r\nmy arm-pits; and now, the most laborious part being over, I took out my\r\nother cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastened them\r\nfirst to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me;\r\nthe wind being favorable, the seamen towed, and I shoved, till we\r\narrived within forty yards of the shore, and waiting till the tide was\r\nout, I got dry to the boat, and, by the assistance of two thousand men,\r\nwith ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and\r\nfound it was but little damaged.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under, by the\r\nhelp of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to get my boat\r\nto the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people\r\nappeared upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious a\r\nvessel. I told the emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat in\r\nmy way, to carry me to some place from whence I might return into my\r\nnative country, and begged his majesty's orders for getting materials to\r\nfit it up, together with his license to depart, which, after some kind\r\nexpostulation, he was pleased to grant.\r\n\r\nI did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any\r\nexpress relating to me from our emperor to the court of Blefuscu. But I\r\nwas afterwards given privately to understand that his imperial majesty,\r\nnever imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was\r\nonly gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise according to the\r\nlicense he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would\r\nreturn in a few days when the ceremony was ended. But he was at last in\r\npain at my long absence; and, after consulting with the treasurer and\r\nthe rest of that cabal,[35] a person of quality was despatched with the\r\ncopy of the articles against me. This envoy had instructions to\r\nrepresent to the monarch of Blefuscu the great lenity of his master, who\r\nwas content to punish me no farther than the loss of mine eyes; that I\r\nhad fled from justice, and, if I did not return in two hours, I should\r\nbe deprived of my title of _nardac_ and declared a traitor. The envoy\r\nfarther added that, in order to maintain the peace and amity between\r\nboth empires, his master expected that his brother of Blefuscu would\r\ngive orders to have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be\r\npunished as a traitor.\r\n\r\nThe emperor of Blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned an\r\nanswer consisting of many civilities and excuses. He said that, as for\r\nsending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible. That, although I\r\nhad deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for\r\nmany good offices I had done him in making the peace. That, however,\r\nboth their majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a\r\nprodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he\r\nhad given orders to fit up with my own assistance and direction; and he\r\nhoped in a few weeks both empires would be freed from so insupportable\r\nan incumbrance.\r\n\r\nWith this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput, and the monarch of\r\nBlefuscu related to me all that had passed; offering me at the same time\r\n(but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection if I would\r\ncontinue in his service; wherein, although I believed him sincere, yet I\r\nresolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers where\r\nI could possibly avoid it; and, therefore, with all due acknowledgments\r\nfor his favorable intentions, I humbly begged to be excused. I told him\r\nthat, since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my\r\nway, I was resolved to venture myself in the ocean, rather than be an\r\noccasion of difference between two such mighty monarchs. Neither did I\r\nfind the emperor at all displeased; and I discovered, by a certain\r\naccident, that he was very glad of my resolution, and so were most of\r\nhis ministers.\r\n\r\nThese considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner\r\nthan I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very\r\nreadily contributed. Five hundred workmen were employed to make two\r\nsails to my boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen folds\r\nof their strongest linen together. I was at the pains of making ropes\r\nand cables, by twisting ten, twenty, or thirty of the thickest and\r\nstrongest of theirs. A great stone, that I happened to find after a long\r\nsearch by the sea-shore, served me for an anchor. I had the tallow of\r\nthree hundred cows for greasing my boat, and other uses. I was at\r\nincredible pains in cutting down some of the largest timber-trees for\r\noars and masts, wherein I was, however, much assisted by his majesty's\r\nship-carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them after I had done the\r\nrough work.\r\n\r\nIn about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his majesty's\r\ncommands, and to take my leave. The emperor and royal family came out of\r\nthe palace. I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very\r\ngraciously gave me; so did the empress and young princes of the blood.\r\nHis majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred _sprugs_\r\na-piece, together with his picture at full length, which I put\r\nimmediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt. The\r\nceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader with at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I SET SAIL AT SIX IN THE MORNING\" P. 98.]\r\n\r\nI stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three hundred\r\nsheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat ready\r\ndressed as four hundred cooks could provide. I took with me six cows and\r\ntwo bulls alive, with as many ewes and lambs, intending to carry them\r\ninto my own country, and propagate the breed. And to feed them on board,\r\nI had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn. I would gladly have\r\ntaken a dozen of the natives, but this was a thing the emperor would by\r\nno means permit; and, besides a diligent search into my pockets, his\r\nmajesty engaged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects, although\r\nwith their own consent and desire.\r\n\r\nHaving thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on the\r\ntwenty-fourth day of September, 1701, at six in the morning; and, when I\r\nhad gone about four leagues to the northward, the wind being at\r\nsoutheast, at six in the evening I descried a small island about half a\r\nleague to the northwest I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the lee\r\nside[36] of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited. I then took some\r\nrefreshment, and went to my rest. I slept well, and, as I conjecture, at\r\nleast six hours, for I found the day broke two hours after I awaked. It\r\nwas a clear night. I ate my breakfast before the sun was up; and heaving\r\nanchor, the wind being favorable, I steered the same course that I had\r\ndone the day before, wherein I was directed by my pocket-compass. My\r\nintention was to reach, if possible, one of those islands, which, I had\r\nreason to believe, lay to the northeast of Van Diemen's Land. I\r\ndiscovered nothing all that day; but upon the next, about three o'clock\r\nin the afternoon, when I had, by my computation, made twenty-four\r\nleagues from Blefuscu, I descried a sail steering to the southeast: my\r\ncourse was due east. I hailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found\r\nI gained upon her, for the wind slackened. I made all the sail I could,\r\nand in half-an-hour she spied me, then hung out her ancient,[37] and\r\ndischarged a gun.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to express the joy I was in, upon the unexpected hope of\r\nonce more seeing my beloved country, and the dear pledges I left in it.\r\nThe ship slackened her sails, and I came up with her, between five and\r\nsix in the evening, September twenty-sixth; but my heart leaped within\r\nme to see her English colors. I put my cows and sheep into my\r\ncoat-pockets, and got on board with all my little cargo of provisions.\r\nThe vessel was an English merchantman returning from Japan by the North\r\nand South Seas; the captain, Mr. John Biddle, of Deptford, a very civil\r\nman and an excellent sailor. We were now in the latitude of 30 degrees\r\nsouth. There were about fifty men in the ship; and here I met an old\r\ncomrade of mine, one Peter Williams, who gave me a good character to\r\nthe captain. This gentleman treated me with kindness, and desired I\r\nwould let him know what place I came from last, and whither I was bound;\r\nwhich I did in few words, but he thought I was raving, and that the\r\ndangers I had underwent had disturbed my head; whereupon I took my black\r\ncattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great astonishment,\r\nclearly convinced him of my veracity. I then showed him the gold given\r\nme by the emperor of Blefuscu, together with his majesty's picture at\r\nfull length, and some other rareties of that country. I gave him two\r\npurses of two hundred _sprugs_ each, and promised, when we arrived in\r\nEngland, to make him a present of a cow and a sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage,\r\nwhich was very prosperous for the most part. We arrived in the Downs[38]\r\non the thirteenth of April, 1702. I had only one misfortune, that the\r\nrats on board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole,\r\npicked clean from the flesh. I got the rest of my cattle safe ashore,\r\nand set them a-grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the\r\nfineness of the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had always\r\nfeared the contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so\r\nlong a voyage, if the captain had not allowed me some of his best\r\nbiscuits, which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was their\r\nconstant food. The short time I continued in England, I made a\r\nconsiderable profit by showing my cattle to many persons of quality and\r\nothers: and before I began my second voyage I sold them for six hundred\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nSince my last return, I find the breed is considerably increased,\r\nespecially the sheep, which I hope will prove much to the advantage of\r\nthe woollen manufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI stayed but two months with my wife and family; for my insatiable\r\ndesire of seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no\r\nlonger. I left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife and fixed her in a\r\ngood house at Redriff. My remaining stock I carried with me, part in\r\nmoney, and part in goods, in hopes to improve my fortune. My eldest\r\nuncle, John, had left me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty\r\npounds a year; and I had a long lease of the \"Black Bull[39],\" in\r\nFetter Lane, which yielded me as much more: so that I was not in any\r\ndanger of leaving my family upon the parish. My son Johnny, named so\r\nafter his uncle, was at the grammar-school, and a towardly[40] child. My\r\ndaughter Betty (who is now well married, and has children), was then at\r\nher needlework. I took leave of my wife and boy and girl, with tears on\r\nboth sides, and went on board the \"Adventure,\" a merchant ship of three\r\nhundred tons, bound for Surat, Captain John Nicholas, of Liverpool,\r\ncommander. But my account of this voyage must be referred to the second\r\npart of my travels.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE FIRST PART.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THEY CONCLUDED ...

HE IS LEFT ON SHORE,\r\n     IS SEIZED BY ONE OF THE NATIVES, AND CARRIED TO A FARMER'S HOUSE.\r\n     HIS RECEPTION, WITH SEVERAL ACCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED THERE. A\r\n     DESCRIPTION OF THE INHABITANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving been condemned by nature and fortune to an active and restless\r\nlife, in two months after my return I again left my native country, and\r\ntook shipping in the Downs on the twentieth day of June, 1702, in the\r\n\"Adventure,\" Captain John Nicholas, a Cornish man, commander, bound for\r\nSurat. We had a very prosperous gale till we arrived at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, where we landed for fresh water; but, discovering a leak, we\r\nunshipped our goods and wintered there: for, the captain falling sick of\r\nan ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March. We then set\r\nsail, and had a good voyage till we passed the Straits of\r\nMadagascar;[41] but having got northward of that island, and to about\r\nfive degrees south latitude, the winds, which in those seas are observed\r\nto blow a constant equal gale, between the north and west, from the\r\nbeginning of December to the beginning of May, on the nineteenth of\r\nApril began to blow with much greater violence and more westerly than\r\nusual, continuing so for twenty days together, during which time we were\r\ndriven a little to the east of the Molucca Islands, and about three\r\ndegrees northward of the line,[42] as our captain found by an\r\nobservation he took the second of May, at which time the wind ceased and\r\nit was a perfect calm; whereat I was not a little rejoiced. But, he,\r\nbeing a man well experienced in the navigation of those seas, bid us all\r\nprepare against a storm, which accordingly happened the day following:\r\nfor the southern wind, called the southern monsoon, began to set in, and\r\nsoon it was a fierce storm.\r\n\r\nFinding it was like to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood by\r\nto hand the foresail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns were\r\nall fast, and handed the mizzen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe ship lay very broad off, so we thought it better spooning before\r\nthe sea, than trying, or hulling. We reefed the foresail and set him, we\r\nhauled aft the foresheet: the helm was hard-a-weather. The ship wore\r\nbravely. We belayed the fore down-haul; but the sail was split, and we\r\nhauled down the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all\r\nthe things clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke\r\nstrange and dangerous. We hauled off the laniard of the whipstaff, and\r\nhelped the man at the helm. We could not get down our topmast, but let\r\nall stand, because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew\r\nthat the topmast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made\r\nbetter way through the sea, seeing we had sea-room. When the storm was\r\nover, we set foresail and mainsail, and brought the ship to. Then we set\r\nthe mizzen, main-top-sail, and the fore-top-sail. Our course was east\r\nnorth east, the wind was at southwest. We got the starboard tacks\r\naboard, we cast off our weather braces and lifts; we set in the lee\r\nbraces, and hauled forward by the weather bowlings, and hauled them\r\ntight and belayed them, and hauled over the mizzen tack to wind-ward and\r\nkept her full and by, as near as she could lie.\r\n\r\nDuring this storm, which was followed by a strong wind, west southwest,\r\nwe were carried, by my computation, about five hundred leagues to the\r\neast, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of\r\nthe world we were. Our provisions held out well, our ship was staunch,\r\nand our crew all in good health; but we lay in the utmost distress for\r\nwater. We thought it best to hold on the same course, rather than turn\r\nmore northerly, which might have brought us to the northwest parts of\r\nGreat Tartary, and into the Frozen Sea.\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth day of June, 1703, a boy on the topmast discovered\r\nland. On the seventeenth, we came in full view of a great island or\r\ncontinent (for we knew not which), on the south side whereof was a small\r\nneck of land, jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold\r\na ship of above one hundred tons. We cast anchor within a league of this\r\ncreek, and our captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the\r\nlong-boat, with vessels for water, if any could be found. I desired his\r\nleave to go with them, that I might see the country, and make what\r\ndiscoveries I could.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to land, we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of\r\ninhabitants. Our men therefore wandered on the shore to find out some\r\nfresh water near the sea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other\r\nside, where I observed the country all barren and rocky. I now began to\r\nbe weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my curiosity, I returned\r\ngently down toward the creek; and the sea being full in my view, I saw\r\nour men already got into the boat, and rowing for life to the ship. I\r\nwas going to holla after them, although it had been to little purpose,\r\nwhen I observed a huge creature walking after them in the sea, as fast\r\nas he could; he waded not much deeper than his knees, and took\r\nprodigious strides; but our men had the start of him about half a\r\nleague, and the sea thereabouts being full of pointed rocks, the monster\r\nwas not able to overtake the boat. This I was afterwards told, for I\r\ndurst not stay to see the issue of the adventure; but ran as fast as I\r\ncould the way I first went, and then climbed up a steep hill, which gave\r\nme some prospect of the country. I found it fully cultivated; but that\r\nwhich first surprised me was the length of the grass, which, in those\r\ngrounds that seemed to be kept for hay, was about twenty feet high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"A HUGE CREATURE WALKING ... IN THE SEA.\" P. 6.]\r\n\r\nI fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to the\r\ninhabitants only as a footpath through a field of barley. Here I walked\r\non for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now near\r\nharvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an hour walking\r\nto the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at least\r\none hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I could\r\nmake no computation of their altitude. There was a stile to pass from\r\nthis field into the next. It had four steps, and a stone to cross over\r\nwhen you came to the uppermost. It was impossible for me to climb this\r\nstile because every step was six feet high, and the upper stone above\r\ntwenty.\r\n\r\nI was endeavoring to find some gap in the hedge, when I discovered one\r\nof the inhabitants in the next field, advancing towards the stile, of\r\nthe same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our boat. He\r\nappeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about ten yards\r\nat every stride, as near as I could guess. I was struck with the utmost\r\nfear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn, from whence I\r\nsaw him at the top of the stile, looking back into the next field on the\r\nright hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than a\r\nspeaking trumpet; but the noise was so high in the air that at first I\r\ncertainly thought it was thunder. Whereupon seven monsters, like\r\nhimself, came towards him with reaping-hooks in their hands, each hook\r\nabout the largeness of six scythes. These people were not so well clad\r\nas the first, whose servants or laborers they seemed to be; for, upon\r\nsome words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I\r\nlay. I kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced\r\nto move, with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were\r\nsometimes not above a foot distance, so that I could hardly squeeze my\r\nbody betwixt them. However, I made a shift to go forward till I came to\r\na part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain and wind.\r\nHere it was impossible for me to advance a step; for the stalks were so\r\ninterwoven that I could not creep through, and the beards of the fallen\r\nears so strong and pointed that they pierced through my clothes into my\r\nflesh. At the same time I heard the reapers not above a hundred yards\r\nbehind me.\r\n\r\nBeing quite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and\r\ndespair, I lay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might\r\nthere end my days. I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children.\r\nI lamented my own folly and wilfulness in attempting a second voyage\r\nagainst the advice of all my friends and relations. In this terrible\r\nagitation of mind, I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose\r\ninhabitants looked upon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in\r\nthe world; where I was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and\r\nperform those other actions which will be recorded forever in the\r\nchronicles of that empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them,\r\nalthough attested by millions. I reflected what a mortification it must\r\nprove to me to appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single\r\nLilliputian would be among us. But this I conceived was to be among the\r\nleast of my misfortunes: for, as human creatures are observed to be more\r\nsavage and cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to\r\nbe a morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians\r\nthat should happen to seize me? Undoubtedly philosophers are in the\r\nright when they tell us that nothing is great or little otherwise than\r\nby comparison. It might have pleased fortune to let the Lilliputians\r\nfind some nation where the people were as diminutive with respect to\r\nthem as they were to me. And who knows but that even this prodigious\r\nrace of mortals might be equally overmatched in some distant part of the\r\nworld, whereof we have yet no discovery?\r\n\r\nScared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these\r\nreflections, when one of the reapers, approaching within ten yards of\r\nthe ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I\r\nshould be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his\r\nreaping-hook. And, therefore, when he was again about to move, I\r\nscreamed as loud as fear could make me. Whereupon the huge creature trod\r\nshort, and looking round about under him for some time, at last espied\r\nme as I lay on the ground. He considered awhile, with the caution of one\r\nwho endeavors to lay hold on a small dangerous animal in such a manner\r\nthat it shall not be able either to scratch or to bite him, as I myself\r\nhave sometimes done with a weasel in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WHEREUPON THE HUGE CREATURE TROD SHORT.\" P. 10.]\r\n\r\nAt length he ventured to take me up between his forefinger and thumb,\r\nand brought me within three yards of his eyes, that he might behold my\r\nshape more perfectly. I guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me\r\nso much presence of mind that I resolved not to struggle in the least as\r\nhe held me in the air, above sixty feet from the ground, although he\r\ngrievously pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers.\r\nAll I ventured was to raise my eyes towards the sun, and place my\r\nhands together in a supplicating posture, and to speak some words in an\r\nhumble melancholy tone, suitable to the condition I then was in. For I\r\napprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground, as we\r\nusually do any little hateful animal which we have a mind to destroy.\r\nBut my good star would have it that he appeared pleased with my voice\r\nand gestures, and began to look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering\r\nto hear me pronounce articulate words, although he could not understand\r\nthem. In the meantime I was not able to forbear groaning and shedding\r\ntears, and turning my head towards my sides; letting him know, as well\r\nas I could, how cruelly I was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and\r\nfinger. He seemed to apprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of\r\nhis coat, he put me gently into it, and immediately ran along with me to\r\nhis master, who was a substantial farmer, and the same person I had\r\nfirst seen in the field.\r\n\r\nThe farmer, having (as I suppose by their talk) received such an account\r\nof me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw,\r\nabout the size of a walking-staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets\r\nof my coat, which it seems he thought to be some kind of covering that\r\nnature had given me. He blew my hair aside, to take a better view of my\r\nface. He called his hinds[43] about him, and asked them (as I afterwards\r\nlearned) whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature\r\nthat resembled me. He then placed me softly on the ground upon all\r\nfours, but I got immediately up, and walked slowly backwards and\r\nforwards to let those people see that I had no intent to run away.\r\n\r\nThey all sat down in a circle about me, the better to observe my\r\nmotions. I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards the farmer. I\r\nfell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and spoke several\r\nwords as loud as I could: I took a purse of gold out of my pocket, and\r\nhumbly presented it to him. He received it on the palm of his hand, then\r\napplied it close to his eye to see what it was, and afterwards turned it\r\nseveral times with the point of a pin (which he took out of his sleeve),\r\nbut could make nothing of it. Whereupon I made a sign that he should\r\nplace his hand on the ground. I then took the purse, and opening it,\r\npoured all the gold into his palm. There were six Spanish pieces, of\r\nfour pistoles[44] each, besides twenty or thirty smaller coins. I saw\r\nhim wet the tip of his little finger upon his tongue, and take up one of\r\nmy largest pieces, and then another, but he seemed to be wholly ignorant\r\nwhat they were. He made me a sign to put them again into my purse, and\r\nthe purse again into my pocket, which, after offering it to him several\r\ntimes, I thought it best to do.\r\n\r\nThe farmer by this time was convinced I must be a rational creature. He\r\nspoke often to me, but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like that\r\nof a water-mill, yet his words were articulate enough. I answered as\r\nloud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within\r\ntwo yards of me; but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to\r\neach other. He then sent his servants to their work, and taking his\r\nhandkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left\r\nhand, which he placed flat on the ground, with the palm upwards, making\r\nme a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above a\r\nfoot in thickness.\r\n\r\nI thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of falling, laid myself at\r\nfull length upon the handkerchief, with the remainder of which he lapped\r\nme up to the head for farther security, and in this manner carried me\r\nhome to his house. There he called his wife, and showed me to her; but\r\nshe screamed and ran back, as women in England do at the sight of a toad\r\nor a spider. However, when she had awhile seen my behavior, and how well\r\nI observed the signs her husband made, she was soon reconciled, and by\r\ndegrees grew extremely tender of me.\r\n\r\nIt was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner. It was\r\nonly one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of an\r\nhusbandman) in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter. The\r\ncompany were the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old\r\ngrandmother. When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some\r\ndistance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the\r\nfloor. I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the\r\nedge for fear of falling. The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled\r\nsome bread on a trencher,[45] and placed it before me. I made her a low\r\nbow, took out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them\r\nexceeding delight.\r\n\r\nThe mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held about three\r\ngallons, and filled it with drink: I took up the vessel with much\r\ndifficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful manner drank to her\r\nladyship's health, expressing the words as loud as I could in English,\r\nwhich made the company laugh so heartily that I was almost deafened by\r\nthe noise. This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was not\r\nunpleasant. Then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher-side;\r\nbut as I walked on the table, being in great surprise all the time, as\r\nthe indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to\r\nstumble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt.\r\nI got up immediately, and observing the good people to be in much\r\nconcern, I took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners),\r\nand, waving it over my head, made three huzzas, to show that I had got\r\nno mischief by my fall.\r\n\r\nBut advancing forwards towards my master (as I shall henceforth call\r\nhim), his youngest son, who sat next him, an arch boy of about ten years\r\nold, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in the air, that I\r\ntrembled in every limb; but his father snatched me from him, and at the\r\nsame time gave him such a box in the left ear as would have felled an\r\nEuropean troop of horse to the earth, ordering him to be taken from the\r\ntable. But being afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and well\r\nremembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to\r\nsparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees,\r\nand, pointing to the boy, made my master to understand as well as I\r\ncould, that I desired his son might be pardoned. The father complied,\r\nand the lad took his seat again; whereupon I went to him and kissed his\r\nhand, which my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of dinner, my mistress's favorite cat leapt into her lap. I\r\nheard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers at work;\r\nand, turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of that\r\nanimal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I computed by\r\nthe view of her head and one of her paws, while her mistress was feeding\r\nand stroking her. The fierceness of this creature's countenance\r\naltogether discomposed me, though I stood at the further end of the\r\ntable, above fifty feet off, and although my mistress held her fast, for\r\nfear she might give a spring and seize me in her talons.\r\n\r\nBut it happened there was no danger; for the cat took not the least\r\nnotice of me, when my master placed me within three yards of her. And as\r\nI have been always told, and found true by experience in my travels,\r\nthat flying or discovering[46] fear before a fierce animal is a certain\r\nway to make it pursue or attack you, so I resolved in this dangerous\r\njuncture to show no manner of concern. I walked with intrepidity five or\r\nsix times before the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard\r\nof her; whereupon she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of\r\nme. I had less apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four\r\ncame into the room, as it is usual in farmers' houses; one of which was\r\na mastiff equal in bulk to four elephants, and a greyhound somewhat\r\ntaller than the mastiff, but not so large.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year\r\nold in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you\r\nmight have heard from London Bridge to Chelsea,[47] after the usual\r\noratory of infants, to get me for a plaything. The mother out of pure\r\nindulgence took me up, and put me towards the child, who presently\r\nseized me by the middle and got my head in its mouth, where I roared so\r\nloud that the urchin was frighted, and let me drop, and I should\r\ninfallibly have broke my neck if the mother had not held her apron\r\nunder me. The nurse, to quiet her babe, made use of a rattle, which was\r\na kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones, and fastened by a\r\ncable to the child's waist. As she sat down close to the table on which\r\nI stood, her appearance astonished me not a little. This made me reflect\r\nupon the fair skins of our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to\r\nus, only because they are of our own size, and their defects not to be\r\nseen but through a magnifying glass, where we find by experiment that\r\nthe smoothest and whitest skins look rough, and coarse and ill-colored.\r\n\r\nI remember, when I was at Lilliput, the complexions of those diminutive\r\npeople appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this\r\nsubject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of\r\nmine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he\r\nlooked on me from the ground than it did upon a nearer view, when I took\r\nhim up in my hand and brought him close, which he confessed was at first\r\na very shocking sight. He said he could discover great holes in my skin;\r\nthat the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the bristles of\r\na boar, and my complexion made up of several colors altogether\r\ndisagreeable: although I must beg leave to say for myself that I am as\r\nfair as most of my sex and country, and very little sunburnt by my\r\ntravels. On the other side, discoursing of the ladies of that emperor's\r\ncourt, he used to tell me one had freckles, another too wide a mouth, a\r\nthird too large a nose, nothing of which I was able to distinguish. I\r\nconfess this reflection was obvious enough; which, however, I could not\r\nforbear, lest the reader might think those vast creatures were actually\r\ndeformed: for I must do them justice to say they are a comely race of\r\npeople; and particularly the features of my master's countenance,\r\nalthough he were but a farmer, when I beheld him from the height of\r\nsixty feet, appeared very well proportioned.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was done my master went out to his labors, and, as I could\r\ndiscover by his voice and gestures, gave his wife a strict charge to\r\ntake care of me. I was very much tired and disposed to sleep, which, my\r\nmistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a\r\nclean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a\r\nman-of-war.\r\n\r\nI slept about two hours, and dreamed I was at home with my wife and\r\nchildren, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked and found myself\r\nalone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above\r\ntwo hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide. My mistress was gone\r\nabout her household affairs, and had locked me in. The bed was eight\r\nyards from the floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I ... DREW MY HANGER TO DEFEND MYSELF.\" P. 18.]\r\n\r\nPresently two rats crept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards and\r\nforwards on my bed. One of them came almost up to my face; whereupon I\r\nrose in a fright, and drew out my hanger to defend myself. The horrible\r\nanimals had the boldness to attack me both sides, and one of them held\r\nhis forefeet at my collar; but I killed him before he could do me any\r\nmischief. He fell down at my feet; and the other, seeing the fate of his\r\ncomrade, made his escape, but not without one good wound on the back,\r\nwhich I gave him as he fled, and made the blood run trickling from him.\r\nAfter this exploit I walked gently to and fro on the bed to recover my\r\nbreath and loss of spirits. These creatures were of the size of a large\r\nmastiff, but infinitely more nimble and fierce; so that, if I had\r\ntaken off my belt before I went to sleep, I must infallibly have been\r\ntorn to pieces and devoured. I measured the tail of the dead rat, and\r\nfound it to be two yards long wanting an inch; but it went against my\r\nstomach to draw the carcase off the bed, where it still lay bleeding. I\r\nobserved it had yet some life; but, with a strong slash across the neck,\r\nI thoroughly despatched it.\r\n\r\nI hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and the\r\nlike particulars, which, however insignificant they may appear to\r\ngrovelling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to\r\nenlarge his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of\r\npublic as well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting\r\nthis and other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have been\r\nchiefly studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of teaming or\r\nstyle. But the whole scene of this voyage made so strong an impression\r\non my mind, and is so deeply memory, that in committing it to paper I\r\ndid not omit one material circumstance. However, upon a strict review, I\r\nblotted out several passages of less moment which were in my first copy,\r\nfor fear of being censured as tedious and trifling, whereof travellers\r\nare often, perhaps not without justice, accused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     A DESCRIPTION OF THE FARMER'S DAUGHTER. THE AUTHOR CARRIED TO A\r\n     MARKET-TOWN, AND THEN TO THE METROPOLIS. THE PARTICULARS OF THIS\r\n     JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of toward parts\r\nfor her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skilful in dressing her\r\nbaby. Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby's cradle for me\r\nagainst night. The cradle was put into a small drawer cabinet, and the\r\ndrawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats. This was my bed\r\nall the time I stayed with these people, though made more convenient by\r\ndegrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known.\r\n\r\nShe made me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as\r\ncould be got, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; and these she\r\nconstantly washed for me with her own hands. She was likewise my\r\nschool-mistress, to teach me the language. When I pointed to anything,\r\nshe told me the name of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I\r\nwas able to call for whatever I had a mind to. She was very\r\ngood-natured, and not above forty feet high, being little for her age.\r\nShe gave me the name of Grildrig, which the family took up, and\r\nafterwards the whole kingdom. The word imports what the Latins call\r\n_nanunculus_, the Italians _homunceletino_, and the English _mannikin_.\r\nTo her I chiefly owe my preservation in that country. We never parted\r\nwhile I was there; I called her my Glumdalclitch, or little nurse; and\r\nshould be guilty of great ingratitude if I omitted this honorable\r\nmention of her care and affection towards me, which I heartily wish it\r\nlay in my power to requite as she deserves.\r\n\r\nIt now began to be known and talked of in the neighborhood, that my\r\nmaster had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a\r\n_splacnuck_, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature;\r\nwhich it likewise imitated in all its actions, seemed to speak in a\r\nlittle language of its own, had already learned several words of theirs,\r\nwent erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was\r\ncalled, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a\r\ncomplexion fairer than a nobleman's daughter of three years old. Another\r\nfarmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master,\r\ncame on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story. I\r\nwas immediately produced and placed upon a table, where I walked as I\r\nwas commanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my\r\nmaster's guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him\r\n_he was welcome_, just as my little nurse had instructed me. This man,\r\nwho was old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better,\r\nat which I could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes\r\nappeared like the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows. Our\r\npeople, who discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in\r\nlaughing, at which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of\r\ncountenance. He had the character of a great miser; and, to my\r\nmisfortune, he well deserved it by the cursed advice he gave my\r\nmaster, to show me as a sight upon a market-day in the next town, which\r\nwas half an hour's riding, about two-and-twenty miles from our house. I\r\nguessed there was some mischief contriving, when I observed my master\r\nand his friend whispering long together, sometimes pointing at me; and\r\nmy fears made me fancy that I overheard and understood some of their\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I CALLED HER MY GLUMDALCLITCH.\" P. 22.]\r\n\r\nBut the next morning, Glumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole\r\nmatter, which she had cunningly picked out from her mother. The poor\r\ngirl laid me on her bosom, and fell a-weeping with shame and grief. She\r\napprehended some mischief would happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who\r\nmight squeeze me to death, or break one of my limbs by taking me in\r\ntheir hands. She had also observed how modest I was in my nature, how\r\nnicely I regarded my honor, and what an indignity conceive it to be\r\nexposed for money, as a public spectacle, to the meanest of the people.\r\nShe said her papa and mamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers,\r\nbut now she found they meant to serve her as they did last year when\r\nthey pretended to give her a lamb, and yet as soon as it was fat sold it\r\nto a butcher. For my own part I may truly affirm that I was less\r\nconcerned than my nurse. I had a strong hope, which left me, that I\r\nshould one day recover my liberty; to the ignominy of being carried\r\nabout for a monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the\r\ncountry, and that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a\r\nreproach if ever I should return to England; since the king of Great\r\nBritain himself, in my condition, must have undergone the same distress.\r\n\r\nMy master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box\r\nthe next market-day, to the neighboring town, and took along with him\r\nhis little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion[48] behind him. The box\r\nwas close on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and\r\na few gimlet holes to let in air. The girl had been so careful as to put\r\nthe quilt of her baby's bed into it, for me to lie down on. However, I\r\nwas terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it were but\r\nof half an hour. For the horse went about forty feet at every step, and\r\ntrotted so high that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling\r\nof a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent; our journey was\r\nsomewhat farther than from London to St. Alban's. My master alighted at\r\nan inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting a while with the\r\ninnkeeper and making some necessary preparations, he hired the\r\n_grultrud_, or crier, to give notice through the town, of a strange\r\ncreature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as a\r\n_splacnuck_ (an animal in that country, very finely shaped, about six\r\nfeet long), and in every part of the body resembling a human creature,\r\ncould speak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.\r\n\r\nI was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might be\r\nnear three hundred feet square. My little nurse stood on a low stool\r\nclose to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do. My\r\nmaster, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to\r\nsee me. I walked about on the table as the girl commanded. She asked me\r\nquestions, as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached,\r\nand I answered them as loud as I could. I turned about several times to\r\nthe company, paid my humble respects, said they were welcome, and used\r\nsome other speeches I had been taught. I took a thimble filled with\r\nliquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their\r\nhealth. I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it, after the manner\r\nof fencers in England. My nurse gave me part of a straw, which I\r\nexercised as a pike, having learnt the art in my youth. I was that day\r\nshown to twelve sets of company, and as often forced to act over again\r\nthe same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and vexation.\r\nFor those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people\r\nwere ready to break down the doors to come in.\r\n\r\nMy master, for his own interest, would not suffer any one to touch me\r\nexcept my nurse, and, to prevent danger, benches were set round the\r\ntable at such a distance as to put me out of everybody's reach. However,\r\nan unlucky school-boy aimed a hazel-nut directly at my head, which very\r\nnarrowly missed me: otherwise, it came with so much violence, that it\r\nwould have infallibly knocked out my brains, for it was almost as large\r\nas a small pumpion,[49] but I had the satisfaction to see the young\r\nrogue well beaten, and turned out of the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"FLOURISHED IT AFTER THE MANNER OF FENCERS IN ENGLAND.\"\r\nP. 26.]\r\n\r\nMy master gave public notice that he would show me again the next\r\nmarket-day, and in the meantime he prepared a more convenient vehicle\r\nfor me, which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my\r\nfirst journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours together,\r\nthat I could hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word. It was at least\r\nthree days before I recovered my strength; and that I might have no rest\r\nat home, all the neighboring gentleman, from a hundred miles round,\r\nhearing of my fame, came to see me at my master's own house. There could\r\nnot be fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the\r\ncountry was very populous); and my master demanded the rate of a full\r\nroom whenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a single\r\nfamily; so that for some time I had but little ease every day of the\r\nweek (except Wednesday which is their Sabbath), although I was not\r\ncarried to the town.\r\n\r\nMy master, finding how profitable I was like to be, resolved to carry me\r\nto the most considerable cities of the kingdom. Having, therefore,\r\nprovided himself with all things necessary for a long journey, and\r\nsettled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the\r\nseventeenth of August, 1703, about two months after my arrival, we set\r\nout for the metropolis, situated the middle of that empire, and about\r\nthree thousand miles distance from our house. My master made his\r\ndaughter Glumdalclitch ride behind him. She carried me on her lap, in a\r\nbox tied about her waist. The girl had lined it on all sides with the\r\nsoftest cloth she could get, well quilted underneath, furnished it with\r\nher baby's bed, provided me with linen and other necessaries, and made\r\neverything as conveniently as she could. We had no other company but a\r\nboy of the house, who rode after us with the luggage.\r\n\r\nMy master's design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to\r\nstep out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village, or\r\nperson of quality's house, where he might expect custom. We made easy\r\njourneys of not above seven or eight score miles a day; for\r\nGlumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with\r\nthe trotting of the horse. She often took me out of my box at my own\r\ndesire, to give me air and show me the country, but always held me fast\r\nby a leading-string. We passed over five or six rivers, many degrees\r\nbroader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges; and there was hardly a\r\nrivulet so small as the Thames at London Bridge. We were ten weeks in\r\nour journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns, besides many\r\nvillages and private families.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the twenty-sixth of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in\r\ntheir language, _Lorbrulgrud_, or Pride of the Universe. My master took\r\na lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the royal\r\npalace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact\r\ndescription of my person and parts.[50] He hired a large room between\r\nthree and four hundred feet wide. He provided a table sixty feet in\r\ndiameter, upon which I was to act my part, and palisadoed it round three\r\nfeet from the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling over. I was\r\nshown ten times a day, to the wonder and satisfaction of all people. I\r\ncould now speak the language tolerably well, and perfectly understood\r\nevery word that was spoken to me. Besides, I had learned their alphabet,\r\nand could make a shift to explain a sentence here and there; for\r\nGlumdalclitch had been my instructor while we were at home, and at\r\nleisure hours during our journey. She carried a little book in her\r\npocket, not much larger than a Sanson's Atlas;[51] it was a common\r\ntreatise for the use of young girls, giving a short account of their\r\nreligion; out of this she taught me my letters, and interpreted the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR SENT FOR TO COURT. THE QUEEN BUYS HIM OF HIS MASTER THE\r\n     FARMER, AND PRESENTS HIM TO THE KING. HE DISPUTES WITH HIS\r\n     MAJESTY'S GREAT SCHOLARS. AN APARTMENT AT COURT PROVIDED FOR THE\r\n     AUTHOR. HE IS IN HIGH FAVOR WITH THE QUEEN. HE STANDS UP FOR THE\r\n     HONOR OF HIS OWN COUNTRY. HE QUARRELS WITH THE QUEEN'S DWARF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frequent labors I underwent every day, made in a few weeks a very\r\nconsiderable change in my health; the more my master got by me, the more\r\ninsatiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced\r\nto a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and, concluding I must soon die,\r\nresolved to make as good a hand of me[52] as he could. While he was thus\r\nreasoning and resolving with himself, a _slardral_, or gentleman-usher,\r\ncame from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither,\r\nfor the diversion of the queen and her ladies. Some of the latter had\r\nalready been to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty,\r\nbehavior, and good sense. Her majesty, and those who attended her, were\r\nbeyond measure delighted with my demeanor. I fell on my knees and begged\r\nthe honor of kissing her imperial foot; but this gracious princess held\r\nout her little finger towards me, after I was set on a table, which I\r\nembraced in both my arms, and put the tip of it with the utmost respect\r\nto my lip.\r\n\r\nShe made me some general questions about my country, and my travels,\r\nwhich I answered as distinctly, and in as few words, as I could. She\r\nasked whether I would be content to live at court. I bowed down to the\r\nboard of the table, and humbly answered that I was my master's slave;\r\nbut if I were at my own disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to\r\nher majesty's service. She then asked my master whether he were willing\r\nto sell me at a good price. He, who apprehended I could not live a\r\nmonth, was ready enough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces\r\nof gold, which were ordered him on the spot, each piece being the\r\nbigness of eight hundred moidores[53]; but, for the proportion of all\r\nthings between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold among\r\nthem, was hardly so great a sum as a thousand guineas[54] would be in\r\nEngland. I then said to the queen, since I was now her majesty's most\r\nhumble creature and vassal, I must beg the favor, that Glumdalclitch,\r\nwho had always attended me with so much care and kindness, and\r\nunderstood to do it so well, might be admitted into her service, and\r\ncontinue to be my nurse and instructor.\r\n\r\nHer majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer's consent,\r\nwho was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court, and the\r\npoor girl herself was not able to hide her joy. My late master withdrew,\r\nbidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in good service, to\r\nwhich I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THIS GRACIOUS PRINCESS HELD OUT HER LITTLE FINGER.\"\r\nP. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe queen observed my coldness, and, when the farmer was gone out of\r\nthe apartment, asked me the reason. I made bold to tell her majesty\r\nthat I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not\r\ndashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature, found by chance in\r\nhis field; which obligation was amply recompensed by the gain he had\r\nmade in showing me through half the kingdom, and the price he had now\r\nsold me for. That the life I had since led was laborious enough to\r\nkill an animal of ten times my strength. That my health was much\r\nimpaired by the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble every\r\nhour of the day, and that, if my master had not thought my life in\r\ndanger, her majesty would not have got so cheap a bargain. But as I\r\nwas out of all fear of being ill-treated under the protection of so\r\ngreat and good an empress, the ornament of nature, the darling of the\r\nworld, the delight of her subjects, the phoenix[55] of the creation;\r\nso, I hoped my late master's apprehensions would appear to be\r\ngroundless, for I already found my spirits to revive, by the influence\r\nof her most august presence.\r\n\r\nThis was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and\r\nhesitation; the latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar\r\nto that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch, while\r\nshe was carrying me to court.\r\n\r\nThe queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was,\r\nhowever, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SHE ... CARRIED ME TO THE KING.\" P. 36.]\r\n\r\nShe took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was then\r\nretired to his cabinet.[56] His majesty, a prince of much gravity and\r\naustere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked\r\nthe queen, after a cold manner, how long it was since she grew fond of a\r\n_splacnuck_; for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast\r\nin her majesty's right hand. But this princess, who hath an infinite\r\ndeal of wit and humor, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire,[57]\r\nand commanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which I did\r\nin a very few words; and Glumdalclitch, who attended at the\r\ncabinet-door, and could not endure I should be out of her sight, being\r\nadmitted, confirmed all that had passed from my arrival at her father's\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nThe king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions,\r\nhad been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly\r\nmathematics; yet, when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk\r\nerect, before I began to speak, conceived I might be a piece of\r\nclockwork (which is in that country arrived to a very great perfection)\r\ncontrived by some ingenious artist. But when he heard my voice, and\r\nfound what I delivered to be regular and rational, he could not conceal\r\nhis astonishment. He was by no means satisfied with the relation I gave\r\nhim of the manner I came into his kingdom, but thought it a story\r\nconcerted between Glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set\r\nof words, to make me sell at a better price. Upon this imagination he\r\nput several other questions to me, and still received rational answers,\r\nno otherwise defective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect\r\nknowledge in the language, with some rustic phrases, which I had learned\r\nat the farmer's house, and did not suit the polite style of a court.\r\n\r\nHis majesty sent for three great scholars, who were then in their weekly\r\nwaiting[58] according to the custom in that country. These gentlemen,\r\nafter they had a while examined my shape with much nicety, were of\r\ndifferent opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could not be\r\nproduced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was not\r\nframed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness or\r\nclimbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth. They observed by my\r\nteeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a carnivorous\r\nanimal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and field-mice,\r\nwith some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be\r\nable to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other insects,\r\nwhich they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could\r\nnot possibly do. They would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my\r\nlittleness was beyond all degrees of comparison; for the queen's\r\nfavorite dwarf, the smallest ever known in that kingdom, was nearly\r\nthirty feet high. After much debate, they concluded unanimously that I\r\nwas only _relplum scalcath_, which is interpreted literally, _lusus\r\nnaturae_;[59] a determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy\r\nof Europe: whose professors, disdaining the old evasion of occult\r\ncauses, whereby the followers of Aristotle endeavored in vain to\r\ndisguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution of all\r\ndifficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge.\r\n\r\nAfter this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two. I\r\napplied myself to the king, and assured his majesty that I came from a\r\ncountry which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my\r\nown stature; where the animals, trees, and houses were all in\r\nproportion, and where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend\r\nmyself, and to find sustenance, as any of his majesty's subjects could\r\ndo here; which I took for a full answer to those gentlemen's arguments.\r\nTo this they only replied with a smile of contempt, saying, that the\r\nfarmer had instructed me very well in my lesson. The king, who had a\r\nmuch better understanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the\r\nfarmer, who, by good fortune, was not yet gone out of town; having\r\ntherefore first examined him privately, and then confronted him with me\r\nand the young girl, his majesty began to think that what we had told him\r\nmight possibly be true. He desired the queen to order that a particular\r\ncare should be taken of me, and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should\r\nstill continue in her office of tending me, because he observed that we\r\nhad a great affection for each other. A convenient apartment was\r\nprovided for her at court; she had a sort of governess appointed to take\r\ncare of her education, a maid to dress her, and two other servants for\r\nmenial offices; but the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself.\r\nThe queen commanded her own cabinet-maker to contrive a box, that might\r\nserve me for a bed-chamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I\r\nshould agree upon. This man was a most ingenious artist, and, according\r\nto my directions, in three weeks finished to me a wooden chamber of\r\nsixteen feet square and twelve high, with sash-windows, a door, and two\r\nclosets, like a London bed-chamber. The board that made the ceiling was\r\nto be lifted up and down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready furnished\r\nby her majesty's upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out every day to\r\nair, made it with her own hands, and, letting it down at night, locked\r\nup the roof over me. A nice workman, who was famous for little\r\ncuriosities, undertook to make me two chairs, with backs and frames, of\r\na substance not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a cabinet to put my\r\nthings in. The room was quilted on all sides, as well as the floor and\r\nthe ceiling, to prevent any accident from the carelessness of those who\r\ncarried me, and to break the force of a jolt when I went in a coach. I\r\ndesired a lock for my door, to prevent rats and mice from coming in: the\r\nsmith, after several attempts, made the smallest that ever was seen\r\namong them; for I have known a larger at the gate of a gentleman's house\r\nin England. I made a shift to keep the key in a pocket of my own,\r\nfearing Glumdalclitch might lose it. The queen likewise ordered the\r\nthinnest silks that could be gotten to make me clothes, not much thicker\r\nthan an English blanket, very cumbersome, till I was accustomed to them.\r\nThey were after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the\r\nPersian, and partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.\r\n\r\nThe queen became so fond of my company that she could not dine without\r\nme. I had a table placed upon the same at which her Majesty ate, just at\r\nher left elbow, and a chair to sit on. Glumdalclitch stood on a stool on\r\nthe floor, near my table, to assist and take care of me. I had an entire\r\nset of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which, in\r\nproportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what I have\r\nseen in a London toy-shop for the furniture of a baby-house: these my\r\nlittle nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals\r\nas I wanted them, always cleaning them herself. No person dined with the\r\nqueen but the two princesses royal the elder sixteen years old, and the\r\nyounger at that time thirteen and a month. Her majesty used to put a bit\r\nof meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself: and her\r\ndiversion was to see me eat in miniature; for the queen (who had,\r\nindeed, but a weak stomach) took up at one mouthful as much as a dozen\r\nEnglish farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some time a\r\nvery nauseous sight. She would craunch the wing of a lark, bones and\r\nall, between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as that of\r\na full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread in her mouth as big as two\r\ntwelve-penny loaves. She drank out of a golden cup, above a hogshead at\r\na draught. Her knives were twice as long as a scythe, set straight upon\r\nthe handle. The spoons, forks, and other instruments, were all in the\r\nsame proportion. I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out of\r\ncuriosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of\r\nthese enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had\r\nnever till then beheld so terrible a sight.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom that every Wednesday (which, as I have before observed,\r\nis their Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes\r\ndine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become\r\na great favorite; and, at these times, my little chair and table were\r\nplaced at his left hand, before one of the salt-cellars. This prince\r\ntook a pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners,\r\nreligion, taws, government, and learning of Europe; wherein I gave him\r\nthe best account I was able. His apprehension was so clear, and his\r\njudgment so exact, that he made very wise reflections and observations\r\nupon all I said. But I confess that after I had been a little too\r\ncopious in talking of my own beloved country, of our trade, and wars by\r\nsea and land, of our schisms in religion, and parties in the state; the\r\nprejudices of his education prevailed so far that he could not forbear\r\ntaking me up in his right hand, and, stroking me gently with the other,\r\nafter a hearty fit of laughing, asked me, whether I was a whig or a\r\ntory? Then turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a\r\nwhite staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the \"Royal Sovereign[60],\"\r\nhe observed how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be\r\nmimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet, says he, I dare\r\nengage these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honor; they\r\ncontrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and cities;\r\nthey make a figure in dress and equipage; they love, they fight, they\r\ndispute, they cheat, they betray. And thus he continued on, while my\r\ncolor came and went several times with indignation, to hear our noble\r\ncountry, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge of France, the\r\narbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honor, and truth, the\r\npride and envy of the world, so contemptuously treated.\r\n\r\nBut, as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature\r\nthoughts, I began to doubt whether I was injured or no. For, after\r\nhaving been accustomed, several months, to the sight and converse of\r\nthis people, and observed every object upon which I cast mine eyes to be\r\nof proportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from\r\ntheir bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that, if I had then beheld a\r\ncompany of English lords and ladies in their finery, and birthday\r\nclothes, acting their several parts in the most courtly manner of\r\nstrutting and bowing and prating, to say the truth, I should have been\r\nstrongly tempted to laugh as much at them as the king and his grandees\r\ndid at me. Neither, indeed, could I forbear smiling at myself, when the\r\nqueen used to place me upon her hand towards a looking-glass, by which\r\nboth our persons appeared before me in full view together; and there\r\ncould nothing be more ridiculous than the comparison; so that I really\r\nbegan to imagine myself dwindled many degrees below my usual size.\r\n\r\nNothing angered and mortified me so much, as the queen's dwarf, who\r\nbeing of the lowest stature that ever in that country (for I verily\r\nthink he was not full thirty feet high) became so insolent at seeing a\r\ncreature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger,\r\nand look big, as he passed by me in the queen's ante-chamber, while I\r\nwas standing on some table, talking with the lords or ladies of the\r\ncourt, and he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness;\r\nagainst which I could only revenge myself, by calling him brother,\r\nchallenging him to wrestle, and such repartees as are usual in the\r\nmouths of court pages. One day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was\r\nso nettled with something I had said to him, that, raising himself upon\r\nthe frame of her majesty's chair, he took me up, as I was sitting down,\r\nnot thinking any harm; and let me drop into a large silver bowl of\r\ncream, and then ran away as fast as he could. I fell over head and ears,\r\nand, if I had not been a good swimmer, it might have gone very hard with\r\nme; for Glumdalclitch, in that instant, happened to be at the other\r\nend of the room, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted\r\npresence of mind to assist me. But my little nurse ran to my relief, and\r\ntook me out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream. I was put to\r\nbed; however, I received no other damage than the loss of a suit of\r\nclothes, which was utterly spoiled. The dwarf was soundly whipped, and,\r\nas a farther punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which\r\nhe had thrown me; neither was he ever restored to favor; for, soon\r\nafter, the queen bestowed him on a lady of high quality, so that I saw\r\nhim no more, to my very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what\r\nextremity such a malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I COULD ONLY REVENGE MYSELF BY CALLING HIM BROTHER.\"\r\nP. 42.]\r\n\r\nHe had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,\r\nalthough, at the same time she was heartily vexed, and would have\r\nimmediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to\r\nintercede. Her majesty had taken a marrow-bone upon her plate and, after\r\nknocking out the marrow, placed the bone on the dish erect, as it stood\r\nbefore. The dwarf watching his opportunity, while Glumdalclitch was gone\r\nto the sideboard, mounted upon the stool she stood on to take care of me\r\nat meals, took me up in both hands, and, squeezing my legs together,\r\nwedged them into the marrow-bone above my waist, where I stuck for some\r\ntime, and made a very ridiculous figure, I believe it was near a minute\r\nbefore any one knew what was became of me; for I thought it below me to\r\ncry out. But, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not\r\nscalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition. The dwarf,\r\nat my entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.\r\n\r\nI was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness;\r\nand she used to ask me, whether the people of my country were as great\r\ncowards as myself? The occasion was this; the kingdom is much pestered\r\nwith flies in summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a\r\nDunstable lark,[61] hardly gave me any rest, while I sat at dinner, with\r\ntheir continual humming and buzzing about my ears. They would sometimes\r\nalight upon my victuals. Sometimes they would fix upon my nose or\r\nforehead, where they stung me to the quick, and I had much ado to defend\r\nmyself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear starting\r\nwhen they came on my face. It was the common practice of the dwarf, to\r\ncatch a number of these insects in his hand, as school-boys do among us,\r\nand let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten me, and\r\ndivert the queen. My remedy was, to cut them in pieces with my knife, as\r\nthey flew in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI remember, one morning, when Glumdalclitch had set me in my box upon a\r\nwindow, as she usually did in fair days, to give me air (for I durst not\r\nventure to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window, as we do\r\nwith cages in England) after I had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat\r\ndown at my table to eat a piece of sweet-cake for my breakfast, above\r\ntwenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming\r\nlouder than the drones[62] of as many bag-pipes. Some of them seized my\r\ncake, and carried it piece-meal away; others flew about my head and\r\nface, confounding me with the noise, and putting me in the utmost\r\nterror of their stings. However, I had the courage to rise and draw my\r\nhanger, and attack them in the air. I despatched four of them, but the\r\nrest got away, and I presently shut my window. These creatures were as\r\nlarge as partridges; I took out their stings, found them an inch and a\r\nhalf long, and as sharp as needles. I carefully preserved them all, and\r\nhaving since shown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts\r\nof Europe, upon my return to England, I gave three of them to Gresham\r\nCollege,[63] and kept the fourth for myself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     THE COUNTRY DESCRIBED. A PROPOSAL FOR CORRECTING MODERN MAPS. THE\r\n     KING'S PALACE, AND SOME ACCOUNT OF THE METROPOLIS. THE AUTHOR'S WAY\r\n     OF TRAVELLING. THE CHIEF TEMPLE DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as\r\nfar as I travelled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round\r\nLorbrulgrud, the metropolis. For the queen, whom I always attended,\r\nnever went farther when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and\r\nthere staid till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers. The\r\nwhole extent of this prince's dominions reacheth about six thousand\r\nmiles in length, and from three to five in breadth. From whence I cannot\r\nbut conclude, that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by\r\nsupposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever\r\nmy opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the\r\ngreat continent of Tartary; and therefore they ought to correct their\r\nmaps and charts, by joining this vast tract of land to the northwest\r\nparts of America, wherein I shall be ready to lend them my assistance.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the northeast by a ridge of\r\nmountains, thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason\r\nof the volcanoes upon the tops: neither do the most learned know what\r\nsort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be\r\ninhabited at all. On the three other sides it is bounded by the ocean.\r\nThere is not one sea-port in the whole kingdom, and those parts of the\r\ncoasts into which the rivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and\r\nthe sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with the smallest\r\nof their boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from any\r\ncommerce with the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nBut the large rivers are full of vessels, and abound with excellent\r\nfish, for they seldom get any from the sea, because the sea-fish are of\r\nthe same size with those in Europe, and consequently not worth catching,\r\nwhereby it is manifest, that nature, in the production of plants and\r\nanimals of so extraordinary a bulk, is wholly confined to this\r\ncontinent, of which I leave the reasons to be determined by\r\nphilosophers. However, now and then, they take a whale, that happens to\r\nbe dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on heartily.\r\nThese whales I have known so large, that a man could hardly carry one\r\nupon his shoulders; and sometimes, for curiosity, they are brought in\r\nhampers to Lorbrulgrud: I saw one of them in a dish at the king's table,\r\nwhich passed for a rarity, but I did not observe he was fond of it; for\r\nI think indeed the bigness disgusted him, although I have seen one\r\nsomewhat larger in Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near a\r\nhundred walled towns, and a great number of villages. To satisfy my\r\ncurious reader, it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud. This city\r\nstands upon almost two equal parts on each side the river that passes\r\nthrough. It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six hundred\r\nthousand inhabitants. It is in length three _glomglungs_ (which make\r\nabout fifty-four English miles) and two and a half in breadth, as I\r\nmeasured it myself in the royal map made by the king's order, which was\r\nlaid on the ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet: I\r\npaced the diameter and circumference several times barefoot, and,\r\ncomputing by the scale, measured it pretty exactly.\r\n\r\nThe king's palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings, about\r\nseven miles round: the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty\r\nfeet high, and broad and long in proportion. A coach was allowed to\r\nGlumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to\r\nsee the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party,\r\ncarried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take\r\nme out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view the\r\nhouses and the people as we passed along the streets, I reckoned our\r\ncoach to be about the square of Westminster-hall, but not altogether so\r\nhigh: however, I cannot be very exact.\r\n\r\nBesides the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered\r\na smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square and ten\r\nhigh, for the convenience of travelling, because the other was somewhat\r\ntoo large for Glumdalclitch's lap, and cumbersome in the coach. It was\r\nmade by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance. This\r\ntravelling closet was an exact square,[64] with a window in the middle\r\nof three of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on\r\nthe outside, to prevent accidents in long journeys. On the fourth side,\r\nwhich had no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the\r\nperson who carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put a\r\nleathern belt, and buckled it about his waist. This was always the\r\noffice of some grave, trusty servant, in whom I could confide, whether I\r\nattended the king and queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see\r\nthe gardens, or pay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in\r\nthe court; for I soon began to be known and esteemed among the greatest\r\nofficers, I suppose more on account of their majesties' favor than any\r\nmerit of my own.\r\n\r\nIn journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would\r\nbuckle on my box, and place it upon a cushion before him; and there I\r\nhad a full prospect of the country on three sides from my three windows.\r\nI had in this closet a field-bed, and a hammock hung from the ceiling,\r\ntwo chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being\r\ntossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach. And having been\r\nlong used to sea voyages, those motions, although sometimes very\r\nviolent, did not much discompose me.\r\n\r\nWhenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my travelling\r\ncloset, which Glumdalclitch held in her lap, in a kind of open sedan,\r\nafter the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by two\r\nothers in the queen's livery. The people, who had often heard of me,\r\nwere very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was complaisant\r\nenough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand, that I\r\nmight be more conveniently seen.\r\n\r\nI was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the tower\r\nbelonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.\r\nAccordingly, one day my nurse carried me thither, but I must truly say\r\nI came back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand\r\nfeet, reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which,\r\nallowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in\r\nEurope, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in\r\nproportion (if I rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple.[65] But, not to\r\ndetract from a nation, to which during my life I shall acknowledge\r\nmyself extremely obliged, it must be allowed that whatever this famous\r\ntower wants in height is amply made up in beauty and strength. For the\r\nwalls are nearly a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each\r\nis about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of\r\ngods and emperors, cut in marble larger than life, placed in their\r\nseveral niches. I measured a little finger which had fallen down from\r\none of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and found\r\nit exactly four feet and an inch in length. Glumdalclitch wrapped it up\r\nin her handkerchief and carried it home in her pocket, to keep among\r\nother trinkets, of which the girl was very fond, as children at her age\r\nusually are.\r\n\r\nThe king's kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about\r\nsix hundred feet high. The great oven is not so wide by ten paces as the\r\ncupola at St. Paul's, for I measured the latter on purpose after my\r\nreturn. But if I should describe the kitchen-grate, the prodigious pots\r\nand kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other\r\nparticulars, perhaps I should be hardly believed; at least, a severe\r\ncritic would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as travellers are\r\noften suspected to do. To avoid which censure, I fear I have run too\r\nmuch into the other extreme; and that if this treatise should happen to\r\nbe translated into the language of Brobdingnag (which is the general\r\nname of that kingdom) and transmitted thither, the king and his people\r\nwould have reason to complain that I had done them an injury, by a false\r\nand diminutive representation.\r\n\r\nHis majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables: they\r\nare generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high. But when he goes\r\nabroad on solemn days, he is attended for state by a militia guard of\r\nfive hundred horse, which indeed I thought was the most splendid sight\r\nthat could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his army in battalia,[66]\r\nwhereof I shall find another occasion to speak.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     SEVERAL ADVENTURES THAT HAPPENED TO THE AUTHOR. THE AUTHOR SHOWS\r\n     HIS SKILL IN NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI should have lived happily enough in that country, if my littleness had\r\nnot exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents, some of\r\nwhich I shall venture to relate. Glumdalclitch often carried me into the\r\ngardens of the court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me out\r\nof it, and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk. I remember,\r\nbefore the dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those\r\ngardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and I being close together,\r\nnear some dwarf apple-trees, I must needs show my wit by a silly\r\nallusion between him and the trees, which happens to hold in their\r\nlanguage, as it doth in ours. Whereupon the malicious rogue, watching\r\nhis opportunity, when I was walking under one of them, shook it directly\r\nover my head; by which a dozen apples, each of them near as large as a\r\nBristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears; one of them hit me on the\r\nback as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me down flat on my face; but I\r\nreceived no other hurt; and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire, because\r\nI had given the provocation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnother day, Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass-plot to divert\r\nmyself, while she walked at some distance with her governess. In the\r\nmeantime there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was\r\nimmediately, by the force of it, struck to the ground; and when I was\r\ndown, the hail stones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body as if I\r\nhad been pelted with tennis-balls, however, I made a shift to creep on\r\nall fours, and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the lee-side\r\nof a border of lemon-thyme, but so bruised from head to foot that I\r\ncould not go abroad in ten days. Neither is this at all to be wondered\r\nat, because nature, in that country, observing the same proportion\r\nthrough all her operations, a hail-stone is near eighteen hundred times\r\nas large as one in Europe, which I can assert upon experience, having\r\nbeen so curious to weigh and measure them.\r\n\r\nBut a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when my\r\nlittle nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place, which I often\r\nentreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts, and having left\r\nmy box at home, to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went to another\r\npart of the garden with governess and some ladies of her acquaintance,\r\nshe was absent and out of hearing, a small white belonging to one of the\r\nchief gardeners, having got by accident into the garden, happened to\r\nplace where I lay: the dog, following the scent, came directly up, and\r\ntaking me in his mouth, ran straight to his master, wagging his tail,\r\nand set me gently on the ground. By good fortune, he had been so well\r\ntaught, that I was carried between his teeth without the least hurt, or\r\neven tearing my clothes. But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and\r\nhad a great kindness for me, was in a terrible fright: he gently took me\r\nup in both his hands, and asked me how I did; but I was so amazed and\r\nout of breath, that I could not speak a word. In a few minutes I came to\r\nmyself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who by this time had\r\nreturned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel agonies when I\r\ndid not appear nor answer when she called. She severely reprimanded the\r\ngardener on account of his dog, but the thing was bushed up and never\r\nknown at court; for the girl was afraid of the queen's anger, and truly,\r\nas to myself, I thought it would not be for my reputation that such a\r\nstory should go about.\r\n\r\nThis accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me\r\nabroad for the future out of her sight. I had been long afraid of this\r\nresolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky\r\nadventures that happened in those times when I was left by myself. Once\r\na kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me; and if I had not\r\nresolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier,[67] he would\r\nhave certainly carried me away in his talons. Another time, walking to\r\nthe top of a fresh mole-hill, I fell to my neck in the hole through\r\nwhich that animal had cast up the earth. I likewise broke my right shin\r\nagainst the shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble over as I was\r\nwalking alone and thinking on poor England.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe in\r\nthose solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all\r\nafraid of me, but would hop about within a yard's distance, looking for\r\nworms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if no\r\ncreature at all were near them. I remember a thrush had the confidence\r\nto snatch out of my hand with his bill a piece of cake that\r\nGlumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast.\r\n\r\nWhen I attempted to catch any of these birds they would boldly turn\r\nagainst me, endeavoring to pick my fingers, which I durst not venture\r\nwithin their reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned to hunt for\r\nworms and snails as they did before. But one day I took a thick cudgel,\r\nand threw it with all my strength so luckily at a linnet that I knocked\r\nhim down, and seizing him by the neck with both my hands ran with him in\r\ntriumph to my nurse. However, the bird, who had only been stunned,\r\nrecovering himself, gave me so many boxes with his wings on both sides\r\nof my head and body, though I held him at arm's length and was out of\r\nthe reach of his claws, that I was twenty times thinking of letting him\r\ngo. But I was soon relieved by one of our servants, who wrung off the\r\nbird's neck, and I had him next day for dinner by the queen's command.\r\nThis linnet, as near as I can remember, seemed to be somewhat larger\r\nthan an English swan.\r\n\r\nThe queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea-voyages, and took\r\nall occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me, whether I\r\nunderstood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little exercise\r\nof rowing might not be convenient for my health. I answered, that I\r\nunderstood both very well; for, although my proper employment had been\r\nto be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was\r\nforced to work like a common mariner. But I could not see how this could\r\nbe done in their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to a\r\nfirst-rate man-of-war among us, and such a boat as I could manage would\r\nnever live in any of their rivers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE SMALLER BIRDS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE AT ALL AFRAID OF\r\nME.\" P. 57.]\r\n\r\nHer majesty said, if I could contrive a boat, her own joiner should make\r\nit, and she would provide a place for me to sail in. The fellow was an\r\ningenious workman, and, by my instructions, in ten days finished a\r\npleasure-boat, with all its tackling, able conveniently to hold eight\r\nEuropeans. When it was finished, the queen was so delighted that she\r\nran with it in her lap to the king, who ordered it to be put in a\r\ncistern full of water, with me in it, by way of trial; where I could not\r\nmanage my two sculls,[68] or little oars, for want of room.\r\n\r\nBut the queen had before contrived another project. She ordered the\r\njoiner to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad,\r\nand eight deep; which, being well pitched, to prevent leaking, was\r\nplaced on the floor along the wall in an outer room of the palace. It\r\nhad a cock near the bottom to let out the water, when it began to grow\r\nstale; and two servants could easily fill it in half-an-hour. Here I\r\noften used to row for my own diversion, as well as that of the queen and\r\nher ladies, who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and\r\nagility. Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my business was only\r\nto steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and when they\r\nwere weary, some of their pages would blow my sail forward with their\r\nbreath, while I showed my art by steering starboard[69] or larboard, as\r\nI pleased. When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried back my boat,\r\ninto her closet, and hung it oh a nail to dry.\r\n\r\nIn this exercise I once met an accident, which had like to have cost me\r\nmy life; for one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the\r\ngoverness, who attended Glumdalclitch, very officiously lifted me up to\r\nplace me in the boat, but I happened to slip through her fingers, and\r\nshould infallibly have fallen down forty feet upon the floor, if, by the\r\nluckiest chance in the world, I had not been stopped by a\r\ncorking-pin[70] that stuck in the good gentlewoman's stomacher;[71] the\r\nhead of the pin passed between my shirt and the waistband of my\r\nbreeches, and thus I held by the middle in the air, till Glumdalclitch\r\nran to my relief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"GAVE ME A GALE WITH THEIR FANS.\" P. 60.]\r\n\r\nAnother time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough\r\nevery third day with fresh water, was so careless as to let a huge frog\r\n(not perceiving it) slip out of his pail. The frog lay concealed till I\r\nwas put into my boat, but then seeing a resting-place, climbed up, and\r\nmade it lean so much on one side that I was forced to balance it with\r\nall my weight on the other to prevent overturning. When the frog was got\r\nin, it hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my head\r\nbackwards and forwards. The largeness of its features made it appear the\r\nmost deformed animal that can be conceived. However, I desired\r\nGlumdalclitch to let me deal with it alone. I banged it a good while\r\nwith one of my sculls, and at last forced it to leap out of the boat.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom was from a\r\nmonkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen. Glumdalclitch\r\nhad locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business\r\nor a visit. The weather being very warm the closet window was left open,\r\nas well as the windows and the door of my bigger box, in which I usually\r\nlived, because of its largeness and conveniency. As I sat quietly\r\nmeditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the closet\r\nwindow, and skip about from one side to the other; whereat, although I\r\nwas much alarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but not stirring from my\r\nseat; and then I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping up and\r\ndown, till at last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with\r\ngreat pleasure and curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI retreated to the farther corner of my room or box; but the monkey\r\nlooking in at every side, put me into such a fright that I wanted\r\npresence of mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have\r\ndone. After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at\r\nlast espied me, and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat\r\ndoes when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to\r\navoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which, being made\r\nof that country silk, was very thick and strong), and dragged me out. He\r\ntook me out in his right fore-foot, and held me as a nurse does a child,\r\njust as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a kitten in\r\nEurope: and, when I offered to struggle, he squeezed me so hard that I\r\nthought it more prudent to submit. I have good reason to believe that he\r\ntook me for a young one of his own species, by his often stroking my\r\nface very gently with his other paw.\r\n\r\nIn these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the closet door, as\r\nif somebody were opening it; whereupon he suddenly leaped up to the\r\nwindow, at which he had come in, and thence upon the leads and gutters\r\nwalking upon three legs, and holding me in the fourth, till he clambered\r\nup to a roof that was next to ours. I heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek\r\nat the moment he was carrying me out. The poor girl was almost\r\ndistracted. That quarter of the palace was all in an uproar; the\r\nservants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen by hundreds in the court,\r\nsitting upon the ridge of a building, holding me like a baby in one of\r\nhis fore-paws: whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear\r\nlaughing; neither do I think they justly ought to be blamed, for without\r\nquestion, the sight was ridiculous enough to everybody but myself. Some\r\nof the people threw up stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but this\r\nwas strictly forbidden, or else very probably my brains had been dashed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men, which the\r\nmonkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able\r\nto make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile,\r\nand made his escape. Here I sat for some time, five hundred yards from\r\nthe ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to\r\nfall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge\r\nto the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse's footmen, climbed up,\r\nand putting me into his breeches-pocket, brought me down safe.\r\n\r\nI was so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by\r\nthis odious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight. The\r\nking, queen, and all the court, sent every day to inquire after my\r\nhealth, and her majesty made me several visits during my sickness. The\r\nmonkey was killed, and an order made that no such animal should be kept\r\nabout the palace.\r\n\r\nWhen I attended the king, after my recovery, to return him thanks for\r\nhis favors, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.\r\nHe asked me what my thoughts and speculations were while I lay in the\r\nmonkey's paw. He desired to know what I would have done upon such an\r\noccasion in my own country. I told his majesty that in Europe we had no\r\nmonkeys, except such as were brought for curiosities from other places,\r\nand so small, that I could deal with a dozen of them together if they\r\npresumed to attack me. And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was\r\nso lately engaged (it was, indeed, as large as an elephant) if my fears\r\nhad suffered me to think so far as to make use of my hanger (looking\r\nfiercely, and clapping my hand upon the hilt, as I spoke) when he poked\r\nhis paw into my chamber, perhaps I should have given him such a wound as\r\nwould have made him glad to withdraw it with more haste than he put it\r\nin. This I delivered in a firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest\r\nhis courage should be called in question.\r\n\r\nHowever, my speech produced nothing else besides a loud laughter, which\r\nall the respect due to his majesty from those about him could not make\r\nthem contain. This made me reflect how vain an attempt it is for a man\r\nto endeavor to do himself honor among those who are out of all degree of\r\nequality or comparison with him. And yet I have seen the moral of my own\r\nbehavior very frequent in England since my return, where a little\r\ncontemptible varlet,[72] without the least title to birth, person, wit,\r\nor common-sense, shall presume to look with importance, and put himself\r\nupon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nI was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story; and\r\nGlumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to\r\ninform the queen whenever I committed any folly that she thought would\r\nbe diverting to her majesty. The girl, who had been out of order, was\r\ncarried by her governess to take the air about an hour's distance, or\r\nthirty miles from town. They alighted out of the coach near a small\r\nfootpath in a field, and, Glumdalclitch setting down my travelling-box,\r\nI went out of it to walk. There was a pool of mud in the path, and I\r\nmust needs try my activity by attempting to leap over it. I took a run,\r\nbut unfortunately jumped short, and found myself just in the middle up\r\nto my knees. I waded through with some difficulty, and one of the\r\nfootmen wiped me as clean as he could with his handkerchief, for I was\r\nfilthily bemired; and my nurse confined me to my box till we returned\r\nhome, when the queen was soon informed of what had passed, and the\r\nfootman spread it about the court; so that all the mirth for some days\r\nwas at my expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     SEVERAL CONTRIVANCES OF THE AUTHOR TO PLEASE THE KING AND QUEEN. HE\r\n     SHOWS HIS SKILL IN MUSIC. THE KING INQUIRES INTO THE STATE OF\r\n     ENGLAND, WHICH THE AUTHOR RELATES TO HIM. THE KING'S OBSERVATIONS\r\n     THEREON.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to attend the king's levee[73] once or twice a week, and had\r\noften seen him under the barber's hand, which indeed was at first very\r\nterrible to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an\r\nordinary scythe. His majesty, according to the custom of the country,\r\nwas only shaved twice a week. I once prevailed on the barber to give me\r\nsome of the suds or lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the\r\nstrongest stumps of hair, I then took a piece of fine wood and cut it\r\nlike the back of a comb, making several holes in it at equal distance\r\nwith as small a needle as I could get from Glumdalclitch. I fixed in the\r\nstumps so artificially, scraping and sloping them with my knife towards\r\nthe points, that I made a very tolerable comb; which was a seasonable\r\nsupply, my own being so much broken in the teeth that it was almost\r\nuseless: neither did I know any artist in that country so nice and exact\r\nas would undertake to make me another.\r\n\r\nAnd this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein I spent many of my\r\nleisure hours. I desired the queen's woman to save for me the combings\r\nof her majesty's hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and\r\nconsulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received general\r\norders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two\r\nchair-frames, no larger than those I had in my box, and then to bore\r\nlittle holes with a fine awl round those parts where I designed the\r\nbacks and seats; through these holes I wove the strongest hairs I could\r\npick out, just after the manner of cane chairs in England. When they\r\nwere finished I made a present of them to her majesty, who kept them in\r\nher cabinet, and used to shew them for curiosities, as indeed they were\r\nthe wonder of every one that beheld them. Of these hairs (as I had\r\nalways a mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little purse, about\r\nfive feet long, with her majesty's name deciphered in gold letters,\r\nwhich I gave to Glumdalclitch, by the queen's consent. To say the truth,\r\nit was more for show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight\r\nof the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it, but some\r\nlittle coins that girls are fond of.\r\n\r\nThe king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to\r\nwhich I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear\r\nthem; but the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the\r\ntunes. I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army\r\nbeating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal it. My\r\npractice was to have my box removed from the place where the performers\r\nsat, as far as I could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and\r\ndraw the window-curtains, after which I found their music not\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI had learnt in my youth to play a little upon the spinet.[74]\r\nGlumdalclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a\r\nweek to teach her. I called it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled\r\nthat instrument, and was played upon in the same manner.\r\n\r\nA fancy came into my head that I would entertain the king and queen\r\nwith an English tune upon this instrument. But this appeared extremely\r\ndifficult; for the spinet was nearly sixty feet long, each key being\r\nalmost a foot wide, so that with my arms extended I could not reach to\r\nabove five keys, and to press them down required a good smart stroke\r\nwith my fist, which would be too great a labor, and to no purpose. The\r\nmethod I contrived was this: I prepared two round sticks, about the\r\nbigness of common cudgels; they were thicker at one end than the other,\r\nand I covered the thicker ends with a piece of mouse's skin, that by\r\nrapping on them I might neither damage the tops of the keys nor\r\ninterrupt the sound. Before the spinet a bench was placed about four\r\nfeet below the keys, and I was put upon the bench. I ran sideling upon\r\nit that way and this as fast as I could, banging the proper keys with my\r\ntwo sticks, and made a shift to play a jig to the great satisfaction of\r\nboth their majesties; but it was the most violent exercise I ever\r\nunderwent, and yet I could not strike above sixteen keys, nor\r\nconsequently play the bass and treble together as other artists do,\r\nwhich was a great disadvantage to my performance.\r\n\r\nThe king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent\r\nunderstanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my\r\nbox, and set upon the table in his closet.[75] He would then command me\r\nto bring one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three\r\nyards distance upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a\r\nlevel with his face. In this manner I had several conversations with\r\nhim. I one day took the freedom to tell his majesty that the contempt\r\nhe discovered towards Europe and the rest of the world did not seem\r\nanswerable to those excellent qualities of mind that he was master of;\r\nthat reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body; on the\r\ncontrary, we observed in our country that the tallest persons were\r\nusually least provided with it. That, among other animals, bees and ants\r\nhad the reputation of more industry, art, and sagacity than many of the\r\nlarger kinds; and that, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I\r\nmight live to do his majesty some signal[76] service. The king heard me\r\nwith attention, and began to conceive a much better opinion of me than\r\nhe had ever before. He desired I would give him as exact an account of\r\nthe government of England as I possibly could because, as fond as\r\nprinces commonly are of their own customs (for he conjectured of other\r\nmonarchs by my former discourses), he should be glad to hear of anything\r\nthat might deserve imitation.\r\n\r\nImagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the\r\ntongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate\r\nthe praise of my own dear native country, in a style equal to its merits\r\nand felicity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE MOST VIOLENT EXERCISE I EVER UNDERWENT.\" P. 71.]\r\n\r\nI began my discourse by informing his majesty that our dominions\r\nconsisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms, under\r\none sovereign, besides our plantations in America. I dwelt long upon the\r\nfertility of our soil and the temperature of our climate. I then spoke\r\nat large upon the constitution of an English parliament, partly made up\r\nof an illustrious body, called the House of Peers, persons of the\r\nnoblest blood and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies. I\r\ndescribed that extraordinary care always taken of their education in\r\narts and arms, to qualify them for being counsellors both to the king\r\nand kingdom; to have a share in the legislature; to be members of the\r\nhighest court of judicature, from whence there could be no appeal; and\r\nto be champions always ready for the defence of their prince and\r\ncountry, by their valor, conduct, and fidelity. That these were the\r\nornament and bulwark of the kingdom, worthy followers of their most\r\nrenowned ancestors, whose honor had been the reward of their virtue,\r\nfrom which their posterity were never once known to degenerate. To these\r\nwere joined several holy persons, as part of that assembly, under the\r\ntitle of bishops, whose peculiar business it is to take care of\r\nreligion, and those who instruct the people therein. These were searched\r\nand sought out through the whole nation, by the prince and his wisest\r\ncounsellors, among such of the priesthood as were most deservedly\r\ndistinguished by the sanctity of their lives and the depth of their\r\nerudition, who were indeed the spiritual fathers of the clergy and the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThat the other part of the parliament consisted of an assembly, called\r\nthe House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, _freely_ picked\r\nand culled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and\r\nlove of their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation. And\r\nthat these two bodies made up the most august assembly in Europe, to\r\nwhom, in conjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nI then descended to the courts of justice, over which the judges, those\r\nvenerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for determining\r\nthe disputed rights and properties of men, as well as for the punishment\r\nof vice and protection of innocence. I mentioned the prudent management\r\nof our treasury, the valor and achievements of our forces by sea and\r\nland. I computed the number of our people, by reckoning how many\r\nmillions there might be of each religious sect or political party among\r\nus. I did not omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other\r\nparticular, which I thought might redound to the honor of my country.\r\nAnd I finished all with a brief historical account of affairs and events\r\nin England for about a hundred years past.\r\n\r\nThis conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several\r\nhours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently\r\ntaking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of what questions\r\nhe intended to ask me.\r\n\r\nWhen I had put an end to these long discourses, his majesty, in a sixth\r\naudience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries, and\r\nobjections, upon every article. He asked what methods were used to\r\ncultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind\r\nof business they commonly spent the first and teachable part of their\r\nlives? What course was taken to supply that assembly when any noble\r\nfamily became extinct? What qualifications were necessary in those who\r\nare to be created new lords; whether the humor of the prince, a sum of\r\nmoney to a court lady as a prime minister, or a design of strengthening\r\na party opposite to the public interest, ever happened to be motives in\r\nthose advancements? What share of knowledge these lords had in the laws\r\nof their country, and how they came by it, so as to enable them to\r\ndecide the properties of their fellow-subjects in the last resort?\r\nWhether they were always so free from avarice, partialities, or want,\r\nthat a bribe or some other sinister view could have no place among them?\r\nWhether those holy lords I spoke of were always promoted to that rank\r\nupon account of their knowledge in religious matters and the sanctity of\r\ntheir lives; had never been compilers with the times while they were\r\ncommon priests, or slavish prostitute chaplains to some noblemen, whose\r\nopinions they continued servilely to follow, after they were admitted\r\ninto that assembly?\r\n\r\nHe then desired to know what arts were practised in electing those whom\r\nI called commoners; whether a stranger, with a strong purse, might not\r\ninfluence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord, or\r\nthe most considerable gentleman in the neighborhood? How it came to pass\r\nthat people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly,\r\nwhich I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often to the ruin of\r\ntheir families, without any salary or pension: because this appeared\r\nsuch an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit, that his majesty\r\nseemed to doubt it might possibly not be always sincere; and he desired\r\nto know whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding\r\nthemselves for the charges and trouble they were at, by sacrificing the\r\npublic good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince, in conjunction\r\nwith a corrupted ministry? He multiplied his questions, and sifted me\r\nthoroughly upon every part of this head, proposing numberless inquiries\r\nand objections, which I think it not prudent or convenient to repeat.\r\n\r\nUpon what I said in relation to our courts of justice, his majesty\r\ndesired to be satisfied in several points; and this I was the better\r\nable to do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in\r\nchancery,[77] which was decreed for me with costs. He asked what time\r\nwas usually spent in determining between right and wrong, and what\r\ndegree of expense? Whether advocates and orators had liberty to plead in\r\ncauses, manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive? Whether\r\nparty in religion or politics was observed to be of any weight in the\r\nscale of justice? Whether those pleading orators were persons educated\r\nin the general knowledge of equity, or only in provincial, national, and\r\nother local customs? Whether they, or their judges, had any part in\r\npenning those laws which they assumed the liberty of interpreting and\r\nglossing[78] upon at their pleasure? Whether they had ever, at different\r\ntimes, pleaded for or against the same cause, and cited precedents to\r\nprove contrary opinions? Whether they were a rich or a poor corporation?\r\nWhether they received any pecuniary reward for pleading or delivering\r\ntheir opinions? And, particularly, whether they were admitted as members\r\nin the lower senate?\r\n\r\nHe fell next upon the management of our treasury, and said he thought my\r\nmemory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about five or six\r\nmillions a year, and, when I came to mention the issues, he found they\r\nsometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he had taken were\r\nvery particular in this point, because he hoped, as he told me, that the\r\nknowledge of our conduct might be useful to him, and he could not be\r\ndeceived in his calculations. But if what I told him were true, he was\r\nstill at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate like a private\r\nperson. He asked me who were our creditors, and where we found to pay\r\nthem. He wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and expensive wars;\r\nthat certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live among very bad\r\nneighbors and that our generals must needs be richer than our kings. He\r\nasked what business we had out of our own islands, unless upon the score\r\nof trade or treaty, or to defend the coasts with our fleet. Above all,\r\nhe was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary standing army in the midst\r\nof peace and among a free people. He said if we were governed by our own\r\nconsent, in the persons of our representatives, he could not imagine of\r\nwhom we were afraid, or against whom we were to fight; and would hear my\r\nopinion, whether a private man's house might not better be defended by\r\nhimself, his children, and family, than by half-a-dozen rascals, picked\r\nup at a venture in the streets for small wages, who might get a hundred\r\ntimes more by cutting their throats?\r\n\r\nHe laughed at my odd kind of arithmetic (as he was pleased to call it),\r\nin reckoning the numbers of our people by a computation drawn from the\r\nseveral sects among us, in religion and politics. He said, he knew no\r\nreason why those who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public should\r\nbe obliged to change, or should not be obliged to conceal them. And as\r\nit was tyranny in any government to require the first, so it was\r\nweakness not to enforce the second: for a man may be allowed to keep\r\npoisons in his closet, but not to vend them about for cordials.\r\n\r\nHe observed, that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry, I had\r\nmentioned gaming: he desired to know at what age this entertainment was\r\nusually taken up, and when it was laid down; how much of their time it\r\nemployed: whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes:\r\nwhether mean, vicious people, by their dexterity in that art, might not\r\narrive at great riches, and sometimes keep our very nobles in\r\ndependence, as well as habituate them to vile companions, wholly take\r\nthem from the improvement of their minds, and force them, by the losses\r\nthey received, to learn and practise that infamous dexterity upon\r\nothers?\r\n\r\nHe was perfectly astonished with the historical account I gave him of\r\nour affairs during the last century, protesting it was only a heap of\r\nconspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions, banishments,\r\nthe very worst effects that avarice, faction, hypocrisy, perfidiousness,\r\ncruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust, malice, and ambition, could\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nHis majesty, in another audience, was at the pains to recapitulate the\r\nsum of all I had spoken; compared the questions he made with the answers\r\nI had given; then taking me into his hands, and stroking me gently,\r\ndelivered himself in these words which I shall never forget, nor the\r\nmanner he spoke them in: \"My little friend Grildrig, you have made a\r\nmost admirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly proved that\r\nignorance, idleness, and vice are the proper ingredients for qualifying\r\na legislator; that laws are best explained, interpreted, and applied by\r\nthose whose interest and abilities lie in perverting, confounding, and\r\neluding them. I observe among you some lines of an institution, which in\r\nits original might have been tolerable, but these half erased, and the\r\nrest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions. It doth not appear, from\r\nall you have said, how any one perfection is required towards the\r\nprocurement of any one station among you; much less that men are\r\nennobled on account of their virtue, that priests are advanced for their\r\npiety or learning, soldiers for their conduct or valor, judges for their\r\nintegrity, senators for the love of their country, or counsellors for\r\ntheir wisdom. As for yourself, continued the king, who have spent the\r\ngreatest part of your life in travelling, I am well disposed to hope you\r\nmay hitherto have escaped many vices of your country. But by what I have\r\ngathered from your own relation, and the answers I have with much pains\r\nwrung and extorted from you, I cannot but conclude the bulk of your\r\nnatives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that\r\nnature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"YOU HAVE MADE A MOST ADMIRABLE PANEGYRIC.\" P. 79.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n     THE AUTHOR'S LOVE OF HIS COUNTRY. HE MAKES A PROPOSAL OF MUCH\r\n     ADVANTAGE TO THE KING, WHICH IS REJECTED. THE KING'S GREAT\r\n     IGNORANCE IN POLITICS. THE LEARNING OF THAT COUNTRY VERY IMPERFECT\r\n     AND CONFINED. THE LAWS, AND MILITARY AFFAIRS, AND PARTIES IN THE\r\n     STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from\r\nconcealing this part of my story. It was in vain to discover my\r\nresentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and I was forced to\r\nrest with patience, while my noble and beloved country was so\r\ninjuriously treated. I am as heartily sorry as any of my readers can\r\npossibly be, that such an occasion was given: but this prince happened\r\nto be so curious and inquisitive upon every particular, that it could\r\nnot consist either with gratitude or good manners, to refuse giving him\r\nwhat satisfaction I was able. Yet this much I may be allowed to say, in\r\nmy own vindication, that I artfully eluded many of his questions, and\r\ngave to every point a more favorable turn, by many degrees, than the\r\nstrictness of truth would allow. For I have always borne that laudable\r\npartiality to my own country, which Dionysius Halicarnassensis[79] with\r\nso much justice, recommends to an historian: I would hide the frailties\r\nand deformities of my political mother, and place her virtues and\r\nbeauties in the most advantageous light. This was my sincere endeavor,\r\nin those many discourses I had with that monarch, although it\r\nunfortunately failed of success.\r\n\r\nBut great allowances should be given to a king who lives wholly secluded\r\nfrom the rest of the world, and must therefore be altogether\r\nunacquainted with the manners and customs that most prevail in other\r\nnations: the want of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices,\r\nand a certain narrowness of thinking, from which we and the politer\r\ncountries of Europe are wholly exempted. And it would be hard indeed, if\r\nso remote a prince's notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a\r\nstandard for all mankind.\r\n\r\nTo confirm what I have now said, and farther to show the miserable\r\neffects of a confined education, I shall here insert a passage which\r\nwill hardly obtain belief. In hopes to ingratiate myself farther into\r\nhis majesty's favor, I told him of an invention discovered between three\r\nand four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder into a heap, on\r\nwhich the smallest spark of fire falling would kindle the whole in a\r\nmoment, although it were as big as a mountain, and make it all fly up in\r\nthe air together with a noise and agitation greater than thunder. That a\r\nproper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or\r\niron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead with\r\nsuch violence and speed as nothing was able to sustain its force. That\r\nthe largest balls thus discharged would not only destroy whole ranks of\r\nan army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink\r\ndown ships with a thousand men in each to the bottom of the sea; and,\r\nwhen linked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging,\r\ndivide hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.\r\nThat we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and\r\ndischarged them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which\r\nwould rip up the pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw\r\nsplinters on every side, dashing out the brains of all who came near.\r\nThat I knew the ingredients very well, which were cheap and common; I\r\nunderstood the manner of compounding them, and could direct his workman\r\nhow to make those tubes of a size proportionable to all other things in\r\nhis majesty's kingdom, and the largest need not to be above a hundred\r\nfeet long; twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged with the proper\r\nquantity of powder and balls, would batter down the walls of the\r\nstrongest town in his dominions in a few hours, or destroy the whole\r\nmetropolis if ever it should pretend to dispute his absolute commands.\r\nThis I humbly offered to his majesty as a small tribute of\r\nacknowledgment, in return for so many marks that I had received of his\r\nroyal favor and protection.\r\n\r\nThe king was struck with horror at the description I had given him of\r\nthose terrible engines, and the proposal I had made. He was amazed, how\r\nso impotent and grovelling an insect as I (these were his expressions),\r\ncould entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner, as to\r\nappear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation, which I\r\nhad painted, as the common effects of those destructive machines,\r\nwhereof, he said, some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been the\r\nfirst contriver. As for himself, he protested, that although few things\r\ndelighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet he\r\nwould rather lose half his kingdom than be privy to such a secret, which\r\nhe commanded me, as I valued my life, never to mention any more.\r\n\r\nA strange effect of narrow principles and short views! that a prince\r\npossessed of every quality which procures veneration, love, and esteem;\r\nof strong parts, great wisdom, and profound learning, endowed with\r\nadmirable talents for government, and almost adored by his subjects,\r\nshould, from a nice unnecessary scruple, whereof in Europe we can have\r\nno conception, let slip an opportunity put into his hands, that would\r\nhave made him absolute master of the lives, the liberties, and the\r\nfortunes of his people. Neither do I say this with the least intention\r\nto detract from the many virtues of that excellent king, whose character\r\nI am sensible will on this account be very much lessened in the opinion\r\nof an English reader; but I take this defect among them to have arisen\r\nfrom their ignorance, by not having hitherto reduced politics into a\r\nscience, as the more acute wits of Europe have done. For I remember very\r\nwell, in a discourse one day with the king, when I happened to say there\r\nwere several thousand books among us, written upon the art of\r\ngovernment, it gave him (directly contrary to my intention) a very mean\r\nopinion of our understandings. He professed both to abominate and\r\ndespise all mystery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a\r\nminister. He could not tell what I meant by secrets of state, where an\r\nenemy or some rival nation were not in the case. He confined the\r\nknowledge of governing within very narrow bounds, to common sense and\r\nreason, to justice and lenity, to the speedy determination of civil and\r\ncriminal causes, with some other obvious topics, which are not worth\r\nconsidering. And he gave it for his opinion, that whoever could make two\r\nears of corn, or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of ground,\r\nwhere only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind, and do more\r\nessential service to his country, than the whole race of politicians put\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in\r\nmorality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be allowed\r\nto excel. But the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful\r\nin life, to the improvement of agriculture, and all mechanical arts; so\r\nthat among us it would be little esteemed. And as to ideas, entities,\r\nabstractions, and transcendentals,[80] I could never drive the least\r\nconception into their heads.\r\n\r\nNo law of that country must exceed in words the number of letters in\r\ntheir alphabet, which consists only in two-and-twenty. But indeed few of\r\nthem extend even to that length. They are expressed in the most plain\r\nand simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial[81] enough to\r\ndiscover above one interpretation; and to write a comment upon any law\r\nis a capital crime. As to the decision of civil causes, or proceedings\r\nagainst criminals, their precedents are so few, that they have little\r\nreason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.\r\n\r\nThey have had the art of printing, as well as the Chinese, time out of\r\nmind: but their libraries are not very large; for that of the king,\r\nwhich is reckoned the largest, doth not amount to above a thousand\r\nvolumes, placed in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, from whence I\r\nhad liberty to borrow what books I pleased. The queen's joiner had\r\ncontrived in one of Glumdalclitch's rooms, a kind of wooden machine,\r\nfive-and-twenty feet high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were\r\neach fifty feet long: it was indeed a movable pair of stairs, the lowest\r\nend placed at ten feet distance from the wall of the chamber. The book I\r\nhad a mind to read was put up leaning against the wall: I first mounted\r\nto the upper step of the ladder, and turning my face towards the book\r\nbegan at the top of the page, and so walking to the right and left about\r\neight or ten paces, according to the length of the lines, till I had\r\ngotten a little below the level of mine eyes, and then descending\r\ngradually, till I came to the bottom: after which I mounted again, and\r\nbegan the other page in the same manner, and so turned over the leaf,\r\nwhich I could easily do with both my hands, for it was as thick and\r\nstiff as a paste-board, and in the largest folios not above eighteen or\r\ntwenty feet long.\r\n\r\nTheir style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they\r\navoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using various\r\nexpressions. I have perused many of their books, especially those in\r\nhistory and morality. Among the rest, I was much diverted with a little\r\nold treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch's bed-chamber, and\r\nbelonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt in\r\nwritings of morality and devotion. The book treats of the weakness of\r\nhuman kind, and is in little esteem, except among the women and the\r\nvulgar. However, I was curious to see what an author of that country\r\ncould say upon such a subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis writer went through all the usual topics of European moralists,\r\nshowing how diminutive, contemptible, and helpless an animal was man in\r\nhis own nature; how unable to defend himself from inclemencies of the\r\nair, or the fury of wild beasts; how much he was excelled by one\r\ncreature in strength, by another in speed, by a third in foresight, by a\r\nfourth in industry. He added, that nature was degenerated in these\r\nlatter declining ages of the world, and could now produce only small\r\nbirths, in comparison to those in ancient times. He said, it was very\r\nreasonable to think, not only that the species of men were originally\r\nmuch larger, but also, that there must have been giants in former ages;\r\nwhich as it is asserted by history and tradition, so it hath been\r\nconfirmed by huge bones and skulls, casually dug up in several parts of\r\nthe kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled race of man in our days.\r\nHe argued, that the very laws of nature absolutely required we should\r\nhave been made in the beginning of a size more large and robust, not so\r\nliable to destruction, from every little accident, of a tile falling\r\nfrom a house, or a stone cast from the hand of a boy, or being drowned\r\nin a little brook. From this way of reasoning the author drew several\r\nmoral applications, useful in the conduct of life, but needless here to\r\nrepeat. For my own part, I could not avoid reflecting, how universally\r\nthis talent was spread, of drawing lectures in morality, or, indeed,\r\nrather matter of discontent and repining, from the quarrels we raise\r\nwith nature. And I believe, upon a strict inquiry, those quarrels might\r\nbe shown as ill-grounded among us as they are among that people.\r\n\r\nAs to their military affairs, they boast that the king's army consists\r\nof a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two thousand\r\nhorse: if that may be called an army which is made up of tradesmen in\r\nthe several cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are\r\nonly the nobility and gentry, without pay or reward. They are indeed\r\nperfect enough in their exercises, and under very good discipline,\r\nwherein I saw no great merit; for how should it be otherwise, where\r\nevery farmer is under the command of his own landlord, and every citizen\r\nunder that of the principal men in his own city, chosen after the manner\r\nof Venice, by ballot?\r\n\r\nI have often seen the militia of Lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise in a\r\ngreat field, near the city, of twenty miles square. They were in all not\r\nabove twenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse: but it was\r\nimpossible for me to compute their number, considering the space of\r\nground they took up. A cavalier, mounted on a large steed, might be\r\nabout ninety feet high. I have seen this whole body of horse, upon a\r\nword of command, draw their swords at once, and brandish them in the\r\nair. Imagination can figure nothing so grand, so surprising, and so\r\nastonishing! it looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were\r\ndarting at the same time from every quarter of the sky.\r\n\r\nI was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is no\r\naccess from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach his\r\npeople the practice of military discipline. But I was soon informed,\r\nboth by conversation and reading their histories: for in the course of\r\nmany ages, they have been troubled with the same disease to which the\r\nwhole race of mankind is subject; the nobility often contending for\r\npower, the people for liberty, and the king for absolute dominion. All\r\nwhich, however, happily tempered by the laws of that kingdom, have been\r\nsometimes violated by each of the three parties, and have more than once\r\noccasioned civil wars, the last whereof was happily put an end to by\r\nthis prince's grandfather, in a general composition;[82] and the\r\nmilitia, then settled with common consent, hath been ever since kept in\r\nthe strictest duty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n     THE KING AND QUEEN MAKE A PROGRESS[83] TO THE FRONTIERS. THE AUTHOR\r\n     ATTENDS THEM. THE MANNER IN WHICH HE LEAVES THE COUNTRY VERY\r\n     PARTICULARLY RELATED. HE RETURNS TO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had always a strong impulse that I should sometime recover my liberty,\r\nthough it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to form any\r\nproject with the least hope of succeeding. The ship in which I sailed\r\nwas the first ever known to be driven within sight of the coast; and the\r\nking had given strict orders, that if at any time another appeared, it\r\nshould be taken ashore, and with all its crew and passengers brought in\r\na tumbrel[84] to Lorbrulgrud. I was treated with much kindness: I was\r\nthe favorite of a great king and queen, and the delight of the whole\r\ncourt; but it was upon such a footing as ill became the dignity of human\r\nkind. I could never forget those domestic pledges I had left behind me.\r\nI wanted to be among people with whom I could converse upon even terms,\r\nand walk about the streets and fields, without being afraid of being\r\ntrod to death like a frog or a young puppy. But my deliverance came\r\nsooner than I expected, and in a manner not very common: the whole story\r\nand circumstances of which I shall faithfully relate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SHE HAD SOME FOREBODING.\" P. 94.]\r\n\r\nI had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of\r\nthe third, Glumdalclitch and I attended the king and queen in a progress\r\nto the south coast of the kingdom. I was carried, as usual, in my\r\ntravelling-box, which, as I have already described, was a very\r\nconvenient closet of twelve feet wide. And I had ordered a hammock to be\r\nfixed by silken ropes from the four corners at the top, to break the\r\njolts, when a servant carried me before him on horseback, as I sometimes\r\ndesired, and would often sleep in my hammock while we were upon the\r\nroad. On the roof of my closet, not directly over the middle of the\r\nhammock, I ordered the joiner to cut out a hole of a foot square, to\r\ngive me air in hot weather as I slept, which hole I shut at pleasure\r\nwith a board that drew backwards and forwards through a groove.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to our journey's end, the king thought proper to pass a few\r\ndays at a palace he hath near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen\r\nEnglish of the sea-side Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued, I had\r\ngotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined to\r\nher chamber. I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene of\r\nmy escape, if ever it should happen I pretended to be worse than I\r\nreally was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea with a\r\npage, whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with\r\nme. I shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch\r\nconsented, nor the strict charge she gave the page[85] to be careful of\r\nme, bursting at the same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some\r\nforeboding of what was to happen.\r\n\r\nThe boy took me out in my box about half-an-hour's walk from the palace\r\ntowards the rocks on the sea-shore. I ordered him to set me down, and\r\nlifting up one of my sashes, cast many a wistful melancholy look towards\r\nthe sea. I found myself not very well, and told the page that I had a\r\nmind to take a nap in my hammock, which I hoped would do me good. I got\r\nin, and the boy shut the window close down to keep out the cold. I soon\r\nfell asleep, and all I can conjecture is, that while I slept, the page,\r\nthinking no danger could happen, went among the rocks to look for birds'\r\neggs, having before observed him from my windows searching about, and\r\npicking up one or two in the clefts. Be that as it will, I found myself\r\nsuddenly awaked with a violent pull upon the ring, which was fastened at\r\nthe top of my box for the conveniency of carriage. I felt my box raised\r\nvery high in the air, and then borne forward with prodigious speed. The\r\nfirst jolt had like to have shaken me out of my hammock, but afterwards\r\nthe motion was easy enough. I called out several times, as loud as I\r\ncould raise my voice, but all to no purpose. I looked towards my\r\nwindows, and could see nothing but the clouds and sky. I heard a noise\r\njust over my head like the clapping of wings, and then began to perceive\r\nthe woful condition I was in, that some eagle had got the ring of my box\r\nin his beak, with an intent to let it fall on a rock like a tortoise in\r\na shell, and then pick out my body and devour it; for the sagacity and\r\nsmell of this bird enabled him to discover his quarry[86] at a great\r\ndistance, though better concealed than I could be within a two-inch\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn a little time I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase\r\nvery fast, and my box was tossed up and down like a sign in a windy day.\r\nI heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought, given to the eagle (for\r\nsuch I am certain it must have been, that held the ring of my box in his\r\nbeak), and then all on a sudden felt myself falling perpendicularly down\r\nfor above a minute, but with such incredible swiftness, that I almost\r\nlost my breath. My fall was stopped by a terrible squash,[87] that\r\nsounded louder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which I\r\nwas quite in the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise\r\nso high that I could see light from the tops of the windows. I now\r\nperceived I was fallen into the sea. My box, by the weight of my body,\r\nthe goods that were in, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength\r\nat the four corners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet deep\r\nin the water. I did then, and do now suppose, that the eagle which flew\r\naway with my box was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let\r\nme drop while he defended himself against the rest, who hoped to share\r\nin the prey. The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for\r\nthose were the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and\r\nhindered it from being broken on the surface of the water. Every joint\r\nof it was well grooved, and the door did not move on hinges, but up and\r\ndown like a sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water\r\ncame in. I got with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first\r\nventured to draw back my slip-board on the roof already mentioned,\r\ncontrived on purpose to let in air, for want of which I found myself\r\nalmost stifled.\r\n\r\nHow often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom\r\none single hour had so far divided me. And I may say with truth that in\r\nthe midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenting my poor\r\nnurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of the\r\nqueen, and the ruin of her fortune. Perhaps many travellers have not\r\nbeen under greater difficulties and distress than I was at juncture,\r\nexpecting every moment to see my box dashed to pieces, or at least\r\noverset by the first violent blast or rising wave. A breach in one\r\nsingle pane of glass would have been immediate death; nor could anything\r\nhave preserved the windows but the strong lattice-wires placed on the\r\noutside against accidents in travelling. I saw the water ooze in at\r\nseveral crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I\r\nendeavored to stop them as well as I could, I was not able to lift up\r\nthe roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done, and\r\nsat on the top of it, where I might at least preserve myself some hours\r\nlonger, than by being shut up (as I may call it) in the hold. Or, if I\r\nescaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but a\r\nmiserable death of cold and hunger? I was four hours under these\r\ncircumstances, expecting, and indeed wishing, every moment to be my\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nI have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed\r\nupon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant\r\nwho used to carry me on horseback would put a leathern belt, and buckle\r\nit about his waist. Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at\r\nleast thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my box\r\nwhere the staples were fixed, and soon after I began to fancy that the\r\nbox was pulled or towed along in the sea, for I now and then felt a sort\r\nof tugging which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows,\r\nleaving me almost in the dark. This gave me some faint hopes of relief,\r\nalthough I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about. I\r\nventured to unscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the\r\nfloor, and having made a hard shift to screw it down again directly\r\nunder the slipping board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the\r\nchair, and putting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for\r\nhelp in a loud voice and in all the languages I understood. I then\r\nfastened my handkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it\r\nup the hole, waved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship\r\nwere near, the seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up\r\nin the box.\r\n\r\nI found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet\r\nto be moved along; and in the space of an hour or better, that side of\r\nthe box where the staples were and had no window struck against\r\nsomething that was hard. I apprehended it to be a rock, and found myself\r\ntossed more than ever. I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my\r\ncloset like that of a cable, and the grating of it as it passed through\r\nthe ring. I then found myself hoisted up by degrees, at least three feet\r\nhigher than I was before. Whereupon I again thrust up my stick and\r\nhandkerchief, calling for help till I was almost hoarse. In return to\r\nwhich I heard a great shout repeated three times, giving me such\r\ntransports of joy as are not to be conceived but by those who feel them.\r\nI now heard a trampling over my head, and somebody calling through the\r\nhole with a loud voice in the English tongue. \"If there be anybody\r\nbelow, let them speak.\" I answered I was an Englishman, drawn by ill\r\nfortune into the greatest calamity that ever any creature underwent, and\r\nbegged by all that was moving to be delivered out of the dungeon I was\r\nin. The voice replied I was safe, for my box was fastened to their ship;\r\nand the carpenter should immediately come and saw a hole in the cover,\r\nlarge enough to pull me out. I answered that was needless, and would\r\ntake up too much time, for there was no more to be done, but let one of\r\nthe crew put his finger into the ring, and take the box out of the sea\r\ninto the ship, and so into the captain's cabin. Some of them upon\r\nhearing me talk so wildly thought I was mad; others laughed; for indeed\r\nit never came into my head that I was now got among people of my own\r\nstature and strength. The carpenter came, and in a few minutes sawed a\r\npassage about four feet square, then let down a small ladder upon which\r\nI mounted, and from thence was taken into the ship in a very weak\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SOMEBODY CALLING ... IN THE ENGLISH TONGUE.\" P. 99.]\r\n\r\nThe sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions,\r\nwhich I had no inclination to answer. I was equally confounded at the\r\nsight of so many pygmies, for such I took them to be, after having so\r\nlong accustomed mine eyes to the monstrous objects I had left. But the\r\ncaptain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest, worthy Shropshire man,\r\nobserving I was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a\r\ncordial to comfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising me\r\nto take a little rest, of which I had great need. Before I went to\r\nsleep, I gave him to understand that I had some valuable furniture in my\r\nbox, too good to be lost; a fine hammock, a handsome two chairs, a\r\ntable, and a cabinet. That my closet was hung on all sides, or rather\r\nquilted, with silk and cotton: that if he would let one of the crew\r\nbring my closet into his cabin, I would open it there before him, and\r\nshow him my goods. The captain, hearing me utter these absurdities,\r\nconcluded I was raving: however (I suppose to pacify me), he promised\r\nto give orders as I desired, and going upon deck, sent some of his men\r\ndown into my closet, from whence (as I afterwards found) they drew up\r\nall my goods, and stripped off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet,\r\nand bedstead, being screwed to the floor, were much damaged by the\r\nignorance of the seamen, who tore them up by force. Then they knocked\r\noff some of the boards for the use of the ship, and when they had got\r\nall they had a mind for, let the hull drop into the sea, which, by\r\nreason of so many breaches made in the bottom and sides, sunk to\r\nrights.[88] And indeed I was glad not to have been a spectator of the\r\nhavoc they made; because I am confident it would have sensibly\r\ntouched me, by bringing former passages into my mind, which I had rather\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nI slept some hours, but was perpetually disturbed with dreams of the\r\nplace I had left, and the dangers I had escaped. However, upon waking, I\r\nfound myself much recovered. It was now about eight o'clock at night,\r\nand the captain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already\r\nfasted too long. He entertained me with great kindness, observing me not\r\nto look wildly, or talk inconsistently; and when we were left alone,\r\ndesired I would give him a relation of my travels, and by what accident\r\nI came to be set adrift in that monstrous wooden chest.\r\n\r\nHe said that about twelve o'clock at noon, as he was looking through his\r\nglass, he spied it at a distance, and thought it was a sail, which he\r\nhad a mind to make[89], being not much out of his course, in hopes of\r\nbuying some biscuit, his own beginning to fall short. That upon coming\r\nnearer and finding his error, he sent out his long-boat to discover what\r\nit was; that his men came back in a fright, swearing they had seen a\r\nswimming-house. That he laughed at their folly, and went himself in the\r\nboat, ordering his men to take a strong cable along with them. That the\r\nweather being calm, he rowed round me several times, observed my windows\r\nand wire-lattices that defenced them. That he discovered two staples\r\nupon one side, which was all of boards, without any passage for light.\r\nHe then commanded his men to row up to that side, and fastening a cable\r\nto one of the staples, ordered them to tow my chest (as they called it)\r\ntowards the ship. When it was there, he gave directions to fasten\r\nanother cable to the ring fixed in the cover, and to raise up my chest\r\nwith pulleys, which all the sailors were not able to do above two or\r\nthree feet. He said they saw my stick and handkerchief thrust out of the\r\nhole, and concluded that some unhappy man must be shut up in the cavity.\r\nI asked whether he or the crew had seen any prodigious birds in the air\r\nabout the time he first discovered me? to which he answered, that,\r\ndiscoursing this matter with the sailors while I was asleep, one of them\r\nsaid he had observed three eagles flying towards the north, but remarked\r\nnothing of their being larger than the usual size, which I suppose must\r\nbe imputed to the great height they were at; and he could not guess the\r\nreason of my question. I then asked the captain how far he reckoned we\r\nmight be from land?\r\n\r\nHe said, by the best computation he could make, we were at least a\r\nhundred leagues. I assured him that he must be mistaken by almost half,\r\nfor I had not left the country from whence I came above two hours before\r\nI dropt into the sea. Whereupon he began again to think that my brain\r\nwas disturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and advised me to go to bed\r\nin a cabin he had provided. I assured him I was well refreshed with his\r\ngood entertainment and company, and as much in my senses as ever I was\r\nin my life.\r\n\r\nHe then grew serious, and desired to ask me freely whether I were not\r\ntroubled in mind by the consciousness of some enormous crime, for which\r\nI was punished by the command of some prince, by exposing me in that\r\nchest, as great criminals in other countries have been forced to sea in\r\na leaky vessel without provisions; for although he should be sorry to\r\nhave taken so ill a man into his ship, yet he would engage his word to\r\nset me safe ashore in the first port where we arrived. He added that his\r\nsuspicions were much increased by some very absurd speeches I had\r\ndelivered, at first to his sailors, and afterwards to himself, in\r\nrelation to my closet chest, as well as by my odd looks and behavior\r\nwhile I was at supper.\r\n\r\nI begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully did,\r\nfrom the last time I left England to the moment he first discovered me.\r\nAnd as truth always forceth its way into rational minds, so this honest\r\nworthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning and very good sense,\r\nwas immediately convinced of my candor and veracity. But, farther to\r\nconfirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet\r\nshould be brought, of which I had the key in my pocket (for he had\r\nalready informed me how seamen disposed of my closet). I opened it in\r\nhis own presence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made\r\nin the country from whence I had been so strangely delivered. There was\r\nthe comb I had contrived out of the stumps of the king's beard. There\r\nwas a collection of needles and pins, from a foot to half a yard long;\r\nfour wasps' stings, like joiners' tacks; some combings of the queen's\r\nhair; a gold ring, which one day she made me a present of in a most\r\nobliging manner, taking it from her little finger and throwing it over\r\nmy head like a collar. I desired the captain would please to accept this\r\nring in return of his civilities, which he absolutely refused. Lastly I\r\ndesired him to see the breeches I had then on, which were made of a\r\nmouse's skin.\r\n\r\nI could force nothing upon him but a footman's tooth, which I observed\r\nhim to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it. He\r\nreceived it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle could\r\ndeserve. It was drawn by an unskilful surgeon, in a mistake, from one of\r\nGlumdalclitch's men, who was affected with the toothache, but it was as\r\nsound as any in his head. I got it cleaned, and put it in my cabinet. It\r\nwas about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had given\r\nhim, and said he hoped when we returned to England I would oblige the\r\nworld by putting it on paper, and making it public. My answer was, that\r\nI thought we were already overstocked with books of travels; that\r\nnothing could now pass which was not extraordinary; wherein I doubted\r\nsome authors less consulted truth than their own vanity, or interest, or\r\nthe diversion of ignorant readers, that my story could contain little\r\nbesides common events, without those ornamental descriptions of strange\r\nplants, trees, birds, and other animals; or of the barbarous customs and\r\nidolatry of savage people, with which most writers abound. However, I\r\nthanked him for his good opinion, and promised to take the matter into\r\nmy thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe said he wondered at one thing very much, which was, to hear me speak\r\nso loud, asking me whether the king or queen of that country were thick\r\nof hearing. I told him it was what I had been used to for above two\r\nyears past, and that I wondered as much at the voices of him and his\r\nmen, who seemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could hear them well\r\nenough. But when I spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in\r\nthe street to another looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when\r\nI was placed on a table, or held in any person's hand. I told him I had\r\nlikewise observed another thing, that when I first got into the ship,\r\nand the sailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most\r\ncontemptible little creatures I had ever beheld. For indeed, while I was\r\nin that prince's country, I could never endure to look in a glass, after\r\nmy eyes had been accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the\r\ncomparison gave me so despicable a conceit of myself. The captain said\r\nthat while we were at supper he observed me to look at everything with a\r\nsort of wonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my\r\nlaughter, which he knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some\r\ndisorder in my brain. I answered, it was very true, and I wondered how I\r\ncould forbear, when I saw his dishes of the size of a silver threepence,\r\na leg of pork hardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a nut-shell, and so\r\nI went on, describing the rest of his household stuff and provisions\r\nafter the same manner. For although the queen had ordered a little\r\nequipage of all things necessary for me, while I was in her service,\r\nyet my ideas were wholly taken up with what I saw on every side of me,\r\nand I winked at my own littleness, as people do at their own faults. The\r\ncaptain understood my raillery very well, and merrily replied that he\r\ndid not observe my stomach so good, although I had fasted all day; and,\r\ncontinuing in his mirth, protested he would have gladly given a hundred\r\npounds to have seen my closet in the eagle's bill, and afterwards in its\r\nfall from so great a height into the sea; which would certainly have\r\nbeen a most astonishing object, worthy to have the description of it\r\ntransmitted to future ages: and the comparison of Phaeton[90] was so\r\nobvious, that he could not forbear applying it, although I did not much\r\nadmire the conceit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MY DAUGHTER KNEELED BUT I COULD NOT SEE HER\" P. 109.]\r\n\r\nThe captain having been at Tonquin, was, in his return to England,\r\ndriven northeastward, to the latitude of 44 degrees, and of longitude\r\n143. But meeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we\r\nsailed southward a long time, and, coasting New Holland, kept our course\r\nwest-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the\r\nreader with a journal of it. The captain called in at one or two ports,\r\nand sent in his long-boat for provisions and fresh water, but I never\r\nwent out of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third\r\nday of June, 1706, about nine months after my escape. I offered to leave\r\npay goods in security for payment of my freight, but the captain\r\nprotested he would not receive one farthing. We took a kind leave of\r\neach other, and I made him promise he would come to see me at my house\r\nin Redriff. I hired a horse and guide for five shillings, which I\r\nborrowed of the captain.\r\n\r\nAs I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses--the trees,\r\nthe cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput. I was\r\nafraid of trampling on every traveller I met, and often called aloud to\r\nhave them stand out of the way, so that I had like to have gotten one or\r\ntwo broken heads for my impertinence.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inquire, one of\r\nthe servants opened the door, I bent down to go in (like a goose under a\r\ngate), for fear of striking my head. My wife ran out to embrace me, but\r\nI stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never be\r\nable to reach my mouth. My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but I\r\ncould not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand with\r\nmy head and eyes erect to above sixty feet; and then I went to take her\r\nup with one hand by the waist. I looked down upon the servants, and one\r\nor two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pygmies, and I\r\na giant. I told my wife she had been too thrifty, for I found she had\r\nstarved herself and her daughter to nothing. In short, I behaved myself\r\nso unaccountably, that they were all of the captain's opinion when he\r\nfirst saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits. This I mention as an\r\ninstance of the great power of habit and prejudice.\r\n\r\nIn a little time, I and my family and friends came to a right\r\nunderstanding: but my wife protested I should never go to sea any more;\r\nalthough my evil destiny so ordered, that she had not power to hinder\r\nme, as the reader may know hereafter. In the meantime I here conclude\r\nthe second part of my unfortunate voyages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan Swift was born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1667, and died in 1745.\r\nHis parents were English. His father died before he was born, and his\r\nmother was supported on a slender pittance by his father's brother. He\r\nwas educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and all through his early life\r\nwas dependent on the generosity of others. His college career was not\r\nhighly creditable, either from the point of view of manners, morals, or\r\nlearning. After leaving college, he travelled through England on foot,\r\nand found employment with a relative of his mother's, Sir William\r\nTemple, in whose house was a noble library; and for two years Swift made\r\nup for some of his shortcomings by studying diligently therein. He went\r\nto Oxford in 1692, took a degree and was ordained in 1694. He was given\r\na parish in Ireland, which he soon resigned, returning to the home of\r\nSir William Temple, where he remained until the death of the latter in\r\n1699.\r\n\r\nTemple left Swift a legacy, and confided to him the editing and\r\npublishing of his works. This task completed, Swift went again to\r\nIreland to another parish, and threw himself into political\r\npamphleteering with great effect, one of the results of his exertions\r\nbeing the securing of freedom from taxation for the Irish clergy. He\r\nsubsequently became Dean of St. Patrick's in Dublin, and for a period\r\nachieved great popularity owing to his powerful political writings.\r\n\r\nWhile in what he called his \"exile\" he wrote _Gulliver's Travels_, which\r\nwas at first published anonymously, the secret of the authorship being\r\nso closely guarded that the publisher did not know who was the author.\r\nDr. Johnson characterized it as \"A production so new and strange that it\r\nfilled the reader with admiration and amazement. It was read by the high\r\nand low, the learned and the illiterate.\" In this work, Jonathan Swift\r\nappears as one of the greatest masters of English we have ever had; as\r\nendowed with an imaginative genius inferior to few; as a keen and\r\npitiless critic of the world, and a bitter misanthropic accounter of\r\nhumanity at large. Dean Swift was indeed a misanthrope by theory,\r\nhowever he may have made exception to private life. His hero, Gulliver,\r\ndiscovers race after race of beings who typify the genera in his\r\nclassification of mankind. Extremely diverting are Gulliver's adventures\r\namong the tiny Lilliputians; only less so are his more perilous\r\nencounters with the giants of Brobdingnag.... By a singular dispensation\r\nof Providence, we usually read the _Travels_ while we are children; we\r\nare delighted with the marvellous story, we are not at all injured by\r\nthe poison. Poor Swift! he was conscious of insanity's approach; he\r\nrepeated annually Job's curse upon the day of his birth; he died a\r\nmadman.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous biographies of Swift; but probably the best\r\ncharacterization of the man and his life, rather than of his books, is\r\nto be found in Thackeray's _English Humorists_, and a closer study of\r\nthe man and his works in Leslie Stevenson's \"Swift,\" in Morley's\r\n_English Men of Letters_. The other biographies of him are: Lord Orrery\r\n_Remarks on the Life and Writings of Dr. Jonathan Swift_, 1751; Hawkes,\r\non his life, 1765; Sheridan's life, 1785; Forster's life, 1875\r\n(unfinished); Henry Craik's life (1882).
