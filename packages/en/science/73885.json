MARTIN'S STREET, LONDON\r\n1909\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_First Edition 1901_\r\n_Reprinted 1909_\r\n\r\n{v}PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nLinnaeus had but a poor opinion of the Amphibia and their describers, or he\r\nwould not have called the former \"pessima tetraque animalia,\" nor would he\r\nhave dismissed the latter with the terse remark: \"Amphibiologi omnium\r\npaucissimi sunt nullique veri.\" That was, however, nearly 150 years ago;\r\nand at the present time there are fewer difficulties in writing a book on\r\nAmphibia and Reptiles. Those who care for the study of Amphibia and\r\nReptiles–the Herpetologists, to give them their scientific title–have never\r\nbeen numerous; but most of them have been serious students. One reason for\r\nthe fact that this branch of Natural History is not very popular, is a\r\nprejudice against creatures some of which are clammy and cold to the touch,\r\nand some of which may be poisonous.  People who delight in keeping Newts or\r\nFrogs, Tortoises or Snakes, are, as a rule, considered eccentric. But in\r\nreality these cold-blooded creatures are of fascinating interest provided\r\nthey are studied properly. The structure of animals is intimately connected\r\nwith their life-habits; and this correlation is perhaps more apparent in\r\nAmphibia and Reptiles than in any other class. The anatomist who studies\r\ninternal and external structure is as much struck with the almost endless\r\nvariety in details as he who takes the trouble to observe the living animal\r\nin its native haunts, or at least under conditions not too unnatural. He\r\nwill agree with V. von Scheffel's Toad \"that those above seem to have no\r\n{vi}notion of the beauties of the swamp\"–brilliantly coloured Newts engaged\r\nin amorous play, concert-giving Frogs, and metamorphosing Tadpoles. The\r\nmotto assigned to the Reptiles seems singularly appropriate when we\r\nconsider that poisonous snakes have been developed from harmless forms, and\r\nthat many kinds of reptiles have lost limbs, teeth, and eyesight in the\r\nprocess of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe present work is intended to appeal to two kinds of readers–to the\r\nfield-naturalist, who, while interested in life-histories, habits, and\r\ngeographical distribution, beauty or strangeness of forms, is indifferent\r\nto the homologies of the metasternum or similar questions;–and to the\r\nmorphologist, who in his turn is liable to forget that his specimens were\r\nonce alive.\r\n\r\nA great portion of the book is anatomical and systematic. It was necessary\r\nto treat anatomy, especially that of the skeleton, somewhat fully, since it\r\nhas long been recognised that it is impossible to base a scientific\r\nclassification upon external characters. The reader familiar with\r\nVertebrate anatomy has a right to expect that questions of special\r\nmorphological interest will be dwelt upon at length. Those who have no\r\nanatomical foundation must be referred to one of the now numerous\r\nintroductory manuals on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe account of the Amphibia is more complete than that of the Reptilia. It\r\nwas possible to diagnose practically all the recent genera; and this has\r\nbeen especially done in the Anura, in order to show how in an otherwise\r\nvery homogeneous group almost any part of the body, internal or external,\r\ncan be modified in kaleidoscopic variety. The same could not be done with\r\nthe Reptilia. Their principal groups,–called sub-classes in the present\r\nwork, in order to emphasise their taxonomic importance in comparison with\r\nthe main groups of Birds and Mammals,–differ so much from each other that\r\nit was decided to refrain {vii}from attempting a general account of them.\r\nMoreover, the number of species of recent lizards and snakes is so\r\nbewildering, the genera of many families being but tedious variations of\r\nthe same theme, that only those forms have been described which are the\r\nmost important, the most striking, or which the traveller is most likely to\r\ncome across. The student who wishes to go farther into systematic details\r\nmust consult the seven volumes of the _Catalogue of Reptiles in the British\r\nMuseum_ (London, 1889-1896). Mr. G. A. Boulenger, the author of this\r\nmagnificent series, has rendered the systematic treatment of recent\r\nAmphibia and Reptiles an easy task. During many years of the most friendly\r\nintercourse I have profited on countless occasions by his ever-ready\r\nadvice. Although he has kindly read the proofs of the part dealing with the\r\nAmphibia it would be unfair to associate him with any of its shortcomings\r\nor with contestable opinions, for which I alone am responsible.\r\n\r\nCope's large work on the Crocodilians, Lizards, and Snakes of North America\r\n(_Rep. U.S. Nat. Mus. for 1898_ (1900)) has unfortunately appeared too late\r\nto be used in the present work.\r\n\r\nThe drawings on wood were, with few exceptions, made by Miss M. E. Durham,\r\nmostly from living specimens–a procedure which has to a great extent\r\ndetermined the selection of the illustrations.\r\n\r\nSince both the metric and the English systems of measurements have been\r\nemployed, it may be well to state for the convenience of the reader that\r\nthe length of a line of the text is four inches or approximately ten\r\ncentimeters.\r\n\r\nI have frequently and freely quoted accounts of previous authors instead of\r\nparaphrasing them. Especial thanks are due to Messrs. Longmans, Green, and\r\nCo., and to Messrs. Murray, {viii}for their courteous permission to make\r\nseveral long quotations from Sir J. E. Tennent's _Ceylon_, and from H. W.\r\nBates' _Naturalist on the River Amazons_.\r\n\r\nLastly, a remark about my Editors. Instead of being a source of annoyance\r\nthey have rendered me the greatest help.\r\n\r\n  H.

THE CLASS AMPHIBIA IN THE PHYLUM\r\nVERTEBRATA–HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF AMPHIBIA\r\n\r\n\r\nA bird is known by its feathers, a Beast by its hairs, a Fish by its fins,\r\nbut there is no such obvious feature which characterises the Amphibia and\r\nthe Reptiles. In fact, they are neither fish, flesh, nor fowl. This\r\nill-defined position is indicated by the want of vernacular names for these\r\ntwo classes, a deficiency which applies not only to the English language.\r\nAll the creatures in question are backboned, creeping animals. Those which\r\nare covered with horny scales, and which from their birth breathe by lungs\r\nonly, as Crocodiles, Tortoises, Lizards, and Snakes, are the Reptiles. The\r\nrest, for instance, Newts or Efts, Frogs and Toads, are the Amphibia. Their\r\nskin is mostly smooth and clammy and devoid of scales; the young are\r\ndifferent from the adult in so far as they breathe by gills and live in the\r\nwater, before they are transformed into entirely lung-breathing,\r\nterrestrial creatures. But there are many exceptions. _Proteus_ and _Siren_\r\nthe mud-eel, always retain their gills; while not a few frogs undergo their\r\nmetamorphosis within the egg, and never breathe by gills. If we add the\r\ntropical limbless, burrowing Coecilians, and last, not least, the\r\nLabyrinthodonts and other fossil forms, the proper definition of the class\r\nAmphibia,–in other words, the reasons for grouping them together into one\r\nclass, separated from the other backboned animals,–requires the examination\r\nof many other characters.\r\n\r\n{4}So far as numbers of living species are concerned, the Amphibia are the\r\nleast numerous of the Vertebrata. There are about 40 limbless, burrowing\r\nAPODA; 100 URODELA or tailed two- or four-footed newts, and about 900\r\nANURA, or tailless, four-footed frogs and toads; in all some 1000 different\r\nspecies. Few, indeed, in comparison with the 2700 Mammals, 3500 Reptiles,\r\nnearly 8000 Fishes, and almost 10,000 Birds. But we shall see that the\r\nAmphibia have not only \"had their day,\" having flourished in bygone ages\r\nwhen they divided the world, so far as Vertebrata were concerned, between\r\nthemselves and the Fishes, but that they never attained a dominant\r\nposition. Intermediate between the aquatic Fishes and the gradually rising\r\nterrestrial Reptiles they had to fight, so to speak, with a double front\r\nduring the struggle of evolution, until by now most of them have become\r\nextinct. The rest persist literally in nooks and corners of the teeming\r\nworld, and only the Frogs and Toads, the more recent branch of the\r\nAmphibian tree, have spread over the whole globe, exhibiting almost endless\r\nvariations of the same narrow, much specialised plan. The greatest charm of\r\nthe Anura lies in their marvellous adaptation to prevailing circumstances;\r\nand the nursing habits of some kinds read almost like fairy-tales.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTERS OF THE AMPHIBIA.[1]\r\n\r\n  1. The vertebrae are (_a_) acentrous, (_b_) pseudocentrous, or (_c_)\r\n  notocentrous.\r\n\r\n  2. The skull articulates with the atlas by two condyles which are formed\r\n  by the lateral occipitals. For exceptions see p. 78.\r\n\r\n  3. There is an auditory columellar apparatus, fitting into the fenestra\r\n  ovalis.\r\n\r\n  4. The limbs are of the tetrapodous, pentadactyle type.\r\n\r\n  5. The red blood-corpuscles are nucleated, biconvex, and oval.\r\n\r\n  6. The heart is (_a_) divided into two atria and one ventricle, and (_b_)\r\n  it has a conus provided with valves.\r\n\r\n  7. The aortic arches are strictly symmetrical.\r\n\r\n  8. Gills are present at least during some early stages of development.\r\n\r\n  9. The kidneys are provided with persistent nephrostomes.\r\n\r\n  10. Lateral sense-organs are present at least during the larval stage.\r\n\r\n  11. The vagus is the last cranial nerve.\r\n\r\n  12. The median fins, where present, are not supported by spinal skeletal\r\n  rays.\r\n\r\n  13. Sternal ribs and a costal or true sternum are absent.\r\n\r\n  14. There is no paired or unpaired medio-ventral, copulatory apparatus.\r\n\r\n  15. Development takes place without amnion and allantois.\r\n\r\n    None of these characters is absolutely diagnostic, except 1 (_c_), and\r\n    this applies only to the Anura and most of the Stegocephali.\r\n\r\n    {5}Numbers 1 (_b_), 1 (_c_), 2, 3, 4 and 12 separate the Amphibia from\r\n    the Fishes.\r\n\r\n    Numbers 1, 6 (_b_), 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 15 separate them from the\r\n    Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals.\r\n\r\n    Number 2 separates them from the Fishes, Reptiles, and Birds.\r\n\r\n    Number 5 separates them from the Mammals.\r\n\r\n    Number 6 (_a_) separates them from the Fishes (excl. Dipnoi), Birds and\r\n    Mammals.\r\n\r\nWe can, therefore, very easily define all the Amphibia, both recent and\r\nextinct, by a combination of the characters enumerated above. For instance,\r\nby the combination of numbers 2, 3 or 4 with either 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 or 15.\r\n\r\n_Amphicondylous Anamnia_ would be an absolutely correct and all-sufficient\r\ndiagnosis, but it would be of little use in the determination of adult\r\nspecimens; and the tetrapodous character is of no avail for Apoda.\r\n_Amphicondylous animals without an intracranial hypoglossal nerve_ is a\r\nmore practical diagnosis.\r\n\r\nIn the case of living Urodela and Anura the absence of any scales in the\r\nskin affords a more popular character; it is unfortunately not applicable\r\nto the Apoda, many of which possess dermal scales, although these are\r\nhidden in the imbricating transverse rings of the epidermis; and the\r\nfrequent occurrence of typical scales of both ecto- and meso-dermal\r\ncomposition in many of the Stegocephali forces us to discard the scales, or\r\nrather their absence, as a diagnostic character of the class Amphibia. The\r\nsame applies to the mostly soft, moist, or clammy, and very glandular\r\nnature of the skin.\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION OF THE CLASS AMPHIBIA IN THE PHYLUM VERTEBRATA.–There is no\r\ndoubt that the Amphibia have sprung from fish-like ancestors, and that they\r\nin turn have given rise to the Reptilia. The Amphibia consequently hold a\r\nvery important intermediate position. It was perhaps not a fortunate\r\ninnovation when Huxley brigaded them with the Fishes as _Ichthyopsida_,\r\nthereby separating them more from the _Sauropsida_ (= Reptilia and Aves),\r\nthan is justifiable,–perhaps more than he himself intended. The\r\nconnecting-link, in any case, is formed by the Stegocephali; all the recent\r\nOrders, the Apoda, Urodela, and Anura, are far too specialised to have any\r\nclaims to the direct ancestral connections. The line leading from\r\nStegocephali to fossil Reptiles, notably to such Proreptilia as _Eryops_\r\nand _Cricotus_, and even to the Lepospondylous Prosauria, is extremely\r\ngradual, and the steps are almost imperceptible. Naturally, {6}assuming\r\nevolution to be true, there must have lived countless creatures which were\r\na \"rudis indigestaque moles,\" neither Amphibia nor Reptilia, in the present\r\nintensified sense of the systematist. The same consideration applies\r\nequally to the line which leads downwards to the Fishes. But the great gulf\r\nwithin the Vertebrata lies between Fishes and Amphibia, between absolutely\r\naquatic creatures with internal gills and \"fins,\" and terrestrial,\r\ntetrapodous creatures, with lungs and fingers and toes. On the side of the\r\nfishes only the Dipnoi and the Crossopterygii come into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe piscine descent of the Amphibia is still proclaimed by the following\r\nfeatures.–(1) The possession by the heart of a long conus arteriosus,\r\nprovided with, in many cases, numerous valves, or at least (Anura) one\r\nseries at the base, another at the beginning of the truncus where the\r\narterial arches branch off; (2) the strictly symmetrical arrangement of\r\nthese arches; (3) the trilocular heart is still like that of the\r\nLung-fishes or Dipnoi; (4) the occurrence of as many as four or even five\r\nbranchial skeletal arches in the larval stage; (5) the glottis is supported\r\nby cartilages which themselves are derivatives of posterior visceral\r\narches; (6) the development of the vertebrae (Stegocephali and Urodela)\r\nfrom four pairs of arcualia, and the formation of the intervertebral joints\r\nby a split across the intervertebral ring of cartilage: this feature is\r\nunknown in Reptilia, but it occurs also in _Lepidosteus_, most probably\r\nalso in _Polypterus_; (7) the hypoglossal still retains the character of a\r\npost-cranial or cervical spinal nerve; (8) the presence of lateral\r\nsense-organs; (9) the possession of external gills is of somewhat doubtful\r\nphylogenetic value, although such gills occur amongst fishes only in Dipnoi\r\nand Crossopterygii. It is not unlikely that in the Amphibia these organs\r\nowe their origin to entirely larval requirements, while the suctorial mouth\r\nof the larvae of the Anura and many fishes has certainly no ancestral\r\nmeaning, but is a case of convergent development.\r\n\r\nThe usual diagnoses of the Amphibia contain the statement that they, or\r\nmost of them, undergo a metamorphosis, or pass through a larval stage. The\r\nsame applies to various fishes; while, on the other hand, the larval (not\r\nancestral) stage has become permanent in the Proteidae and Sirenidae; and\r\nlastly, we cannot well speak of larvae in the viviparous _Salamandra atra_.\r\n\r\n{7}THE EVOLUTION OF AN ADEQUATE CLASSIFICATION OF THE AMPHIBIA has been a\r\nlong process. Even their recognition as a class, separate from, and of\r\nequal rank with that of, the Reptilia, was by no means generally accepted\r\nuntil comparatively recent times. A historical sketch of the laborious,\r\noften painful, striving for light, in France and Germany, then in England,\r\nand lastly in America, is not without interest.\r\n\r\n  The term _Amphibia_ was invented by Linnaeus for the third class of\r\n  animals in his famous \"Systema Naturae.\" It comprises a very queer\r\n  assembly, which, even in the 13th edition (1767), stands as follows:–\r\n\r\n    1. REPTILES PEDATI, with the four \"genera\" _Testudo_, _Draco_,\r\n    _Lacerta_, and _Rana_. _Lacerta_ includes Crocodiles, Lizards, and\r\n    Newts!\r\n\r\n    2. SERPENTES APODES.\r\n\r\n    3. NANTES PINNATI. Elasmobranchs, Sturgeons, Lampreys, and various\r\n    other fishes.\r\n\r\n  Laurenti, 1768, in a dissertation entitled \"Specimen medicum, exhibens\r\n  Synopsin Reptilium ...,\" uses Brisson's term, REPTILES, and divides them\r\n  into:–\r\n\r\n    REPTILIA SALIENTIA, these are the Anura.\r\n\r\n    GRADIENTIA, namely the Urodela and Lizards.\r\n\r\n    SERPENTIA, the Snakes and the Apoda.\r\n\r\n  Brongniart, 1800, \"Essay d'une classification naturelle des Reptiles,\"[2]\r\n  distinguishes:–\r\n\r\n    CHELONII, SAURII, OPHIDII, BATRACHII; the last for the Frogs, Toads,\r\n    and Newts.\r\n\r\n  Latreille, 1804, \"Nouveau Dict. Hist. Nat.\" xxiv.,[3] accepts the four\r\n  Orders of Brongniart's \"Reptiles,\" but clearly separates the fourth\r\n  Order, \"BATRACHII,\" from the rest by the following, now time-honoured,\r\n  diagnosis: _Doigts des pattes n'ayant pas d'ongles; des branchies, du\r\n  moins pendant un temps; des métamorphoses_. But there is not one word\r\n  about \"Amphibia\" in opposition to \"Reptilia.\"\r\n\r\n  Duméril, 1806, \"Zoologie analytique\" (p. 90), and \"Élémens de l'histoire\r\n  naturelle,\" 1807, divides the \"Reptiles batraciens,\" or \"Batracii,\" into\r\n  ECAUDATI and CAUDATI; he also introduces the terms \"ANOURES\" and\r\n  \"URODÈLES\" as their equivalents; but since these terms appear in the\r\n  French form purists do not admit their having any claim to recognition!\r\n\r\n  Oppel, 1811, \"Die Ordnungen, Familien und Gattungen der Reptilien,\"\r\n  establishes the term APODA for the Coeciliae, and recognises their\r\n  affinity to the Ecaudata and Caudata by removing them from the Snakes.\r\n\r\n  De Blainville, 1816, \"Prodrome d'une nouvelle distribution du règne\r\n  animal\"[4]–\r\n\r\n    AMPHIBIENS SQUAMIFÈRES.

That\r\npart which should correspond with the centrum is formed either by the\r\nmeeting and subsequent complete co-ossification of the two chief dorsal and\r\nventral pairs of arcualia {12}(tail-vertebrae), or entirely by the pair of\r\nchief dorsal arcualia. There is consequently no neuro-central suture.\r\nMoreover, the central region of each vertebra is strongly pinched in\r\nlaterally, widening towards the ends. Another feature of the vertebral\r\ncolumn of the Urodela is the possession of a considerable amount of\r\nintervertebral cartilage, by which the successive vertebrae are held\r\ntogether. This cartilage does not ossify, and it either remains continuous,\r\nserving in its entirety and owing to its flexibility as a joint, or it\r\nbecomes more or less imperfectly separated into a cup and ball portion, the\r\ncup belonging to the posterior end of the vertebra. Such joints are called\r\nopisthocoelous, and occur in the Desmognathinae and Salamandrinae. In the\r\nadult the cup and ball frequently calcify, and the chorda dorsalis or\r\nnotochord is completely destroyed. Those vertebrae between which the\r\nintervertebral cartilage remains unbroken, are called amphicoelous, since\r\nin them, most obviously in macerated or dried skeletons, the vertebrae\r\nappear hollowed out at either end. In such amphicoelous vertebrae a\r\nconsiderable amount of the chorda always remains, running in an unbroken\r\nstring through the whole length of the vertebral column. Towards adult life\r\nthe chorda becomes constricted, and is ultimately squeezed out or\r\ndestroyed, in the middle of the vertebra, by the invasion of cartilage from\r\nthe chief arcualia. This intravertebrally situated cartilage has been\r\ndescribed erroneously as chordal cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe development of the vertebrae proceeds as follows. First appear a pair\r\nof basidorsalia and a pair of basiventralia (Fig. 1, 1, B.D, B.V), blocks\r\nof cartilage, imbedded in and resting upon the thin sheath of the chorda\r\ndorsalis. Next appears a pair of interdorsal blocks, immediately behind the\r\nbasidorsals; and somewhat later appears a pair of interventral blocks.\r\nThese four pairs of cartilages or \"arcualia\" each meet, above or below the\r\nchorda, and form semi-rings, which again by extending upwards or downwards\r\nfuse into complete rings, in such a way that the interdorsal and\r\ninterventral elements form the intervertebral mass spoken of above. The\r\nbasidorsals fuse with the basiventrals, and form the body of the vertebra,\r\nthe fusion being effected chiefly by the calcification and ossification of\r\nthe lateral connecting portion of the skeletogenous layer. The basidorsalia\r\nform the neural arches with their unpaired short spinous or neural, and the\r\npaired anterior and posterior zygapophysial processes. Concerning the\r\n{13}basiventralia we have to distinguish between the trunk and the tail. In\r\nthe latter they produce a pair of ventral outgrowths or haemapophyses,\r\nwhich ultimately enclose the caudal blood-vessels. In the trunk the\r\nbasiventral blocks of cartilage are suppressed; they appear in the early\r\nlarvae, but disappear during or even before metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.–1-5, Five successive stages of the development of a\r\ncaudal vertebra of a newt; 6-7, the second and the first cervical vertebra\r\nof _Cryptobranchus_; 8-9, side view of the constituent cartilaginous blocks\r\nof a caudal vertebra (8) and a trunk-vertebra (9) of _Archegosaurus_ as\r\ntypical examples of Temnospondylous quadripartite and tripartite vertebrae.\r\nThe cross-hatched parts indicate the articular facets for the ribs. The\r\nanterior end of all the vertebrae looks towards the right side. _af_, In 7,\r\narticulating facet for the occipital condyle; _B.D_, basidorsal piece or\r\nneural arch; _B.V_, basiventral piece or ventral arch; _Ch_, chorda\r\ndorsalis, or notochord; _I.D_, interdorsal piece; _I.V_, interventral\r\npiece; _I.V.L_, intervertebral ligament; _N_, spinal nerve–these are\r\nnumbered I, II, III in 6 and 7; _R_, rib; _T_, in 7, rib-like tubercle on\r\nthe first vertebra.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the tail the vertebrae diminish in size, and their\r\nconstituent cartilages assume a more and more indifferent shape, until they\r\nbecome confluent into a continuous rod of cartilage, resembling in this\r\nrespect the Dipnoi and Holocephali. A periodical revival of this rod, at\r\nleast of its connective tissue, appears in the tail-filament of the male\r\n_Triton palmatus_ during the breeding-season.\r\n\r\nThe first vertebra, called the atlas, because it carries the head, is\r\nremarkable for the possession of an odontoid process. The latter is formed\r\nby a pair of cartilages and represents part of a vertebra, the dorsal\r\nportion of which seems to have been added to the occipital part of the\r\ncranium.\r\n\r\n{14}All the trunk-vertebrae, with the exception of the atlas, carry ribs,\r\nat least vestiges thereof. Owing to the early disappearance of the\r\nbasiventral cartilages the capitular portions of the ribs are much reduced,\r\nand are mostly represented by strands of connective tissue only. The ribs\r\ndevelop therefore occasionally at some distance from the vertebral column,\r\nand that portion of the rib which in the metamorphosed young newt looks\r\nlike the capitulum is to a great extent really its tuberculum. Witness the\r\nposition of the vertebral artery, which still indicates the true foramen\r\ntransversarium. The homologies of these parts are still more obscured by\r\nthe fact that a new process grows out from the rib, by which the latter\r\ngains a new support upon a knob of the neural arch. Thus an additional\r\nforamen is formed, sometimes confounded with the true transverse canal. The\r\nmeaning which underlies all these modifications is the broadening of the\r\nbody, the ribs shifting their originally more ventral support towards the\r\ndorsal side. The whole process is intensified in the Anura; it is an\r\ninitial stage of the notocentrous type of vertebrae. The transverse\r\nossified processes of the adult are often much longer than the vestiges of\r\nthe ribs themselves, and are somewhat complicated structures. They are\r\ncomposed first of the rib-bearing cartilaginous outgrowths of the neural\r\narches; secondly, of a broad string of connective tissue which extends from\r\nthe ventro-lateral corner of the perichordal skeletogenous layer to the\r\nribs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.–Transverse section through a trunk-vertebra of a\r\nlarva of _Salamandra maculosa_, enlarged. The right side shows the actually\r\nexisting state, while on the left side the rib and its attachments are\r\nrestored to their probable original condition. _A_, Vertebral artery within\r\nthe true transverse canal; _B.V_, remnant of the basi-ventral cartilage;\r\n_Ch_, chorda dorsalis; _Sp.c_, spinal canal; *, the false transverse\r\ncanal.]\r\n\r\nThe SHOULDER-GIRDLE is extremely simple. It remains almost entirely\r\ncartilaginous, and the three constituent elements are not separated by\r\nsutures. Ossification is restricted to the base of the shaft of the\r\nscapula, and may extend thence over the glenoid cavity. The coracoids are\r\nbroad, loosely overlap each other, and are \"tenon and mortised\" into the\r\ntriangular or lozenge-shaped {15}cartilaginous sternum, which latter has no\r\nconnection with the ribs. The precoracoid is a large, flat process,\r\ndirected forwards, not meeting its fellow; it is absent in _Siren_.\r\n\r\nThe humerus articulates with both radius and ulna, and these two bones of\r\nthe forearm remain separate. The elements which compose the wrist and hand\r\nexhibit an almost ideally simple arrangement, slightly varied by the\r\nfrequent fusion of two or more neighbouring carpalia into one, and by the\r\nreduction of the number of fingers. Most frequently the intermedium and the\r\nulnar carpal element fuse together, and there is more often one centrale\r\ninstead of two. The wrist and hand of the Urodela represent, however, no\r\nlonger the entirely primitive pentadactyle type, owing to the loss of one\r\nfinger together with its metacarpal and carpal element. Comparison with the\r\nAnura makes it probable that the Urodela have lost the pollex, their four\r\nfingers being consequently the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th. _Siren_ has four or\r\nthree fingers; _Proteus_ has only three fingers and three large compound\r\ncarpal cartilages. In _Amphiuma_, with either three or two fingers, the\r\nulnare, intermedium, and carpale are fused together, the radiale with the\r\nneighbouring carpale. The number of phalanges in the four-fingered species\r\nis generally 2, 3, 3, 2 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe PELVIC GIRDLE.–The ilium stands vertically to the vertebral axis,\r\nslanting slightly forwards and downwards. It is attached by means of a rib\r\nto only one vertebra, and this ilio-sacral connection is acetabular in its\r\nposition, _i.e._ it lies in the same transverse plane with the acetabulum,\r\nin other words vertically above it. The ventral portion of the pelvis is\r\nformed by one large continuous mass, the united pubo-ischia, the anterior\r\nor pubic portion of which extends forwards in the shape of a broad triangle\r\n(_Necturus_) or as a slender, stalked, Y-shaped cartilage, the epipubis,\r\nwhich is often movably jointed at its base. The lateral portion of the\r\npubic cartilage is always perforated by the nervus obturatorius.\r\nOssification is restricted to the ischium and to the middle of the shaft of\r\nthe ilium. The acetabular fossa for the femur is closed. The tibia and\r\nfibula remain separate. The foot is still more primitive than the anterior\r\nextremity, as the majority of Urodela possess the full complement of five\r\ntoes, with 2, 2, 3, 3, 2 phalanges respectively. Concrescence of the\r\ntarsalia applies most frequently to the fourth and fifth distal {16}and to\r\nthe two centralia; exceptional, for instance, in _Cryptobranchus\r\njaponicus_, are as many as three centralia, but this is an individual, even\r\na one-sided variation, as shown for instance by a specimen in the Cambridge\r\nMuseum. Loss of the fifth toe occurs sporadically in genera of different\r\ngroups, namely, in _Salamandrella_, _Batrachyperus_, _Salamandrina_,\r\n_Necturus_, _Manculus_, _Batrachoseps_. In _Amphiuma_ the number is reduced\r\nto three or two; in _Proteus_ to two; and in _Siren_ the hind limbs, with\r\ntheir girdle, are altogether absent. Lastly, in some species of _Spelerpes_\r\nand _Batrachoseps_ both fore and hind limbs have become so small as to be\r\npractically without function, parallel cases being found among various\r\nScincidae and other Lizards.\r\n\r\nThe HYOID APPARATUS is still very primitive in many, especially in larval,\r\nUrodela. Besides the hyoid there are as many as four pairs of branchial\r\narches, which, however, decrease in size and completeness, so that the last\r\ntwo have lost their connection with the median copular piece, and become\r\nattached in various ways to the second branchial arch. This is the\r\narrangement apparently in all larvae, but four pairs of branchials persist\r\nin the adult _Siren_, _Amphiuma_, and _Cryptobranchus alleghaniensis_. The\r\nwhole branchial apparatus is reduced to three pairs of arches in _Necturus_\r\nand _Proteus_, to two in the adult _Cryptobranchus japonicus_ and in the\r\nSalamandridae. Of considerable interest is the vestige of a fifth pair of\r\narches in the larvae of _Triton_ and _Salamandra_, in the shape of a pair\r\nof tiny cartilages, which lie in front and on each side of the opening of\r\nthe trachea, and give rise to the formation of the laryngeal cartilages,\r\nbetter developed in the higher Vertebrata.\r\n\r\nThe following are noteworthy characters of the SKULL OF URODELA. The\r\narticulation of the skull with the vertebral column is not always effected\r\nentirely by the two condyles of the lateral occipital bones, but the median\r\nbasal cartilage often possesses a pair of facets for the odontoid-like\r\nprocess of the first vertebra; such additional facets are perhaps best\r\ndeveloped in _Cryptobranchus_ and in the Salamandrinae.\r\n\r\nThe middle portion of the primitive cranium, from the exit of the optic\r\nnerve to the ethmoid cartilage, is formed by a pair of separate bones, the\r\norbito-sphenoids. The parietal and frontal bones remain separate. One or\r\nmore periotic bones exist, besides the prootic, in the aquatic families.\r\n\r\n{17}A pair of prefrontal bones is present in most Salamandridae, e.g.\r\n_Salamandra_, _Triton_, _Amblystoma_, especially in the larva, and in\r\n_Cryptobranchus_; these bones are absent in _Amphiuma_, _Necturus_,\r\n_Proteus_, and _Siren_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.–Skulls of various Urodela. 1, _Salamandra maculosa_,\r\nventral view, and 2, dorsal view; 3, Axolotl stage of _Amblystoma_; 4,\r\nadult stage of _Amblystoma_; 5, _Salamandrina perspicillata_ (after\r\nWiedersheim); 6, _Salamandra maculosa_, dorsal view of the lower jaw. _A_,\r\nArticulare; _C_{1}_, _C_{2}_, outer and inner occipital condyles; _Ch_,\r\nchoana or posterior nasal opening; _d_, dentary; _E_, ethmoid; _F_,\r\nfrontal; _LO_, lateral occipital; _M_, maxillary; _N_, nasal; _No_,\r\nnostril; _OS_, orbito-sphenoid; _P_, parietal; _Pf_, prefrontal; _Pl_,\r\npalatine; _Pm_, premaxillary; _Po_, prootic; _PS_, parasphenoid; _Pt_,\r\npterygoid; _Q_, quadrate; _S_, angulo-splenial; _Sq_, squamosal; _St_,\r\nstapes; _Vo_, vomer; II, VII, X, exits of the optic, facial, and\r\nglosso-vagus nerves.]\r\n\r\nThe lacrymalia are still separate in some Amblystomatinae, e.g. _Ranidens_\r\nand _Hynobius_.

The parasphenoid is furnished with\r\nteeth in the Plethodontinae and Desmognathinae.\r\n\r\nSeparate palatine bones exist in _Necturus_ and _Proteus_, and in the larva\r\nof _Amblystoma_, but in the adult form they fuse with the vomers, producing\r\nthe vomero-palatines characteristic of the majority of Urodela.\r\n\r\n{18}The pterygoid bones are most fully developed, so as to reach the\r\nvomero-palatines, in the Amblystomatinae, in _Necturus_, and in _Proteus_;\r\nthey are reduced, so as to leave a gap, in _Cryptobranchus_, and still more\r\nin the Salamandrinae; they are absent in _Amphiuma_ and in _Siren_.\r\n\r\nThe quadrates are directed forwards in _Necturus_, _Proteus_, and _Siren_,\r\nwhile in the other Urodela they extend transversely and almost\r\nhorizontally. The hyomandibular remnant, the so-called operculum, is small,\r\nand forms a plate which fits into the fenestra ovalis, extending as a\r\nligamentous process upon the quadrate.\r\n\r\nThe quadrato-jugal elements are reduced to ligaments. In many Salamandrinae\r\nthe large orbito-temporal space is divided into an orbital and a temporal\r\nfossa by an arch which is formed by the meeting of two corresponding\r\nprocesses from the squamosal and frontal bones respectively. This bridge is\r\nrarely bony (_Salamandrina_, _Triton_), mostly ligamentous;–apparently a\r\nreminiscence of the Stegocephalous condition. The two premaxillary bones\r\nare liable to fuse into one, for instance in _Cryptobranchus_, generally in\r\nadult Tritons. They are most reduced, and are toothless, in _Siren_.\r\n\r\nThe two maxillary bones are absent only in _Necturus_, _Proteus_,\r\n_Typhlomolge_, and _Siren_. Their posterior end is frequently free, loosely\r\nconnected by ligaments with the pterygoid in _Cryptobranchus_; or with the\r\ndistal portion of the quadrate, and in this case either just touching it\r\n(_Tylototriton_), or forming a broad junction (_Pachytriton_).\r\n\r\nEach half of the lower jaw consists of a dentary, articular and\r\nangulo-splenial. The splenial remains as a separate element in _Siren_; in\r\nothers only during the larval period. There are no mento-Meckelian\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKELETON OF THE ANURA\r\n\r\nTHE VERTEBRAL COLUMN.–The distinctive peculiarities of the vertebrae of the\r\nAnura are that they are notocentrous, and that about a dozen of them are\r\nmodified and fused into an os coccygeum. The whole column is the most\r\nspecialised found in the Vertebrata; and various stages are rapidly hurried\r\nthrough and obscured caenogenetically during the embryonic development.\r\nPaired cartilages appear on the dorsal side of the thin chordal sheath, and\r\nwhilst tending to enclose the spinal cord in a {19}canal, their bases grow\r\nhead- and tail-wards into what will ultimately become the intervertebral\r\nregion. This extension of cartilage leads to a fusion with that of the next\r\nfollowing pair of arches, so that the axial column at this early stage\r\nconsists of a right and left longitudinal ridge of cartilage which sends\r\noff dorsal processes, neural arches, in metameric succession. Next, the\r\nintervertebral cartilage increases in such a way as to constrict the chorda\r\neither laterally (_Rana_) or obliquely from above downwards and inwards\r\n(_Bufo_, _Hyla_). We recognise in this cartilage the interdorsalia. Ventral\r\narcualia are late and much obscured. There is scarcely any cartilage which\r\ncould represent the interventralia, the intervertebral cartilage being\r\nalmost entirely made up of the interdorsalia. These fuse together and form\r\na disc or nodule, which later fuses either with the vertebra in front, and\r\nin this case fits into a cup carried by the vertebra next behind\r\n(procoelous vertebrae), or the knob is added to the front end of the\r\nvertebra, fitting into a cup formed by the tail end of the vertebra next in\r\nfront (opisthocoelous vertebrae). Much later than the two longitudinal\r\ndorsal bands there appears on the ventral side an unpaired band in which\r\nappear metamerically repeated swellings of cartilage, likewise unpaired.\r\nThese swellings become confluent, in a way similar to that which produced\r\nthe dorsal bands, and form the unpaired ventral band of cartilage, the\r\nhypochordal cartilage of some authors. The swellings in this band,\r\nequivalent to the basiventralia, become semilunar in a transverse view,\r\ntheir horns tending upwards towards the basidorsal cartilages, but there is\r\nno actual meeting. Both dorsal and ventral elements are, however, joined\r\ntogether and form the chief portion of the vertebrae, owing to the rapidly\r\nproceeding calcification and later ossification of the all-surrounding\r\n\"membrana reuniens\" or skeletogenous layer so far as that is not\r\ncartilaginous.\r\n\r\nProcoelous vertebrae exist in the overwhelming majority of Anura;\r\nopisthocoelous are those of the Aglossa, the Discoglossidae, and of some\r\nPelobatidae. The systematic value of this pro- or opistho-coelous character\r\nhas been much exaggerated. We have seen that the centra of the vertebrae of\r\nthe Anura are formed entirely by the interdorsal elements, hence the term\r\n\"notocentrous,\" and these centra sometimes remain in adult specimens of\r\n_Pelobates_ as separately ossified and calcified pieces, {20}not fused with\r\nthe rest of the vertebrae. This important discovery has been made by\r\nBoulenger, but Stannius had previously mentioned a specimen of _Pelobates_\r\nin which the second and fourth vertebrae are biconvex, the third, sixth,\r\nand eighth biconcave. Moreover, since the sacral vertebra, generally the\r\nninth, in all the Anura is invariably biconvex, the eighth being biconcave\r\nin the procoelous families, opisthocoelous like the remaining seven\r\nvertebrae in the other families, it is not difficult to imagine that in the\r\nAnura the production of pro- or opistho-coelous vertebrae depends simply\r\nupon the centra or articulating knobs happening to fuse either with the\r\nhind or the front end of the vertebrae. This must of course ultimately be\r\ndetermined by a mechanical problem of motion.\r\n\r\nA second type of the vertebrae amongst the Anura is the epichordal type, an\r\nexaggeration in degree of the notocentrous tendencies of the more usual\r\nperichordal arrangement. It shows, namely, the almost complete suppression\r\nof all the ventral cartilaginous elements, so that the chorda remains for a\r\nlong time on the ventral surface of the axial column in the shape of a\r\nflattened longitudinal band. These two types are not unconnected. The\r\nsuppression of the ventral elements applies most typically to the trunk\r\nregion, while hypochordal cartilage exists in the anterior cervical\r\nvertebrae, and above all in the coccyx. Typically epichordal are the\r\nvertebrae of _Pipa_, _Xenopus_, _Bombinator_, _Pelobates_, _Discoglossus_\r\nand _Alytes_. It is significant that the epichordal often coincide with\r\nopisthocoelous vertebrae, and still more suggestive is the fact that\r\n_Bombinator_ is eminently aquatic, _Pipa_ and _Xenopus_ entirely so, having\r\nlost the tympanum, at least externally. The epichordal feature is not\r\nnecessarily indicative of relationship. It has probably been developed\r\nindependently in various groups, in correlation with a resumption of\r\naquatic life. Various genera of Pelobatidae and most likely some\r\nCystignathidae, e.g. _Pseudis_, will not improbably connect the two types\r\nand their several correlated features, for instance, the frequent reduction\r\nof the tympanic cavity.\r\n\r\nThe os coccygeum has retained rather primitive features in so far as much\r\ndorsal and ventral cartilage is developed; but this has almost entirely\r\nlost its metameric arrangement, and the posterior half of the coccyx is\r\nformed chiefly by the ventral mass of cartilage, while the dorsal elements\r\nare more or less reduced. {21}Only two vertebrae, generally the tenth and\r\neleventh of the whole column, are clearly visible, each being composed of a\r\npair of dorsal and a pair of ventral cartilaginous blocks. The sacral\r\nvertebra articulates with the coccyx by one or two convexities, but in the\r\nAglossa, in some Pelobatidae, and a few others, the coccyx is fused with\r\nthe sacral vertebra. Beyond the first and second component vertebrae of the\r\nembryonic coccyx, the cartilage is continued in the shape of two dorsal,\r\nand one ventral, bands, which soon fuse with each other. Dorsally this\r\ncartilage surrounds the spinal cord; the latter degenerates towards the end\r\nof the tadpole-stage, leaving, however, the empty spinal canal. The chorda,\r\ncompletely surrounded by cartilage, persists into the post-larval stage,\r\nbut is destroyed long before the creature attains maturity. Ultimately the\r\nwhole coccyx ossifies.\r\n\r\nThe tail proper, namely that portion which is absorbed during the\r\nmetamorphosis, remains throughout its existence in an apparently primitive\r\ncondition. The chorda dorsalis and the spinal cord extend through its whole\r\nlength, surrounded by continuous connective tissue without any cartilage;\r\nin fact it represents a piece of typical vertebral column before the\r\nappearance of cartilage. The reduction of this swimming organ begins at the\r\nhind end.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral column of the adult.–The first vertebra (we will call it the\r\natlas since it carries the skull) is not, as in the Urodela, provided with\r\nan odontoid process. It articulates by two cups with the condyles of the\r\nocciput. In some Anura it co-ossifies, rather incompletely, with the second\r\nvertebra, regularly in the fossil _Palaeobatrachus_, often in\r\n_Ceratophrys_, _Breviceps_, and occasionally in _Pelobates_, _Bufo_,\r\n_Rana_, and _Xenopus_. This is, however, no justification for looking upon\r\nthe first vertebra as a complex of two vertebrae, although the atlas is\r\nfrequently very thick and broad, and even carries, in the Aglossa,\r\nconsiderable lateral wings or diapophyses. Those of the trunk-vertebrae are\r\noften very long, acting thereby as substitutes for ribs which are absent,\r\nexcept on the second, third, and fourth vertebrae of the Discoglossidae,\r\nand on the second and third of the Aglossa. In the adult Aglossa these ribs\r\nfuse with the processes which carry them.\r\n\r\nThe diapophyses of the sacral vertebra carry no ribs, the ilia being\r\nattached to them directly. They are either cylindrical {22}as in the\r\nRanidae and Cystignathidae, or they are more or less dilated as in all the\r\nother families, most strongly in the Pelobatidae and the Aglossa. In some\r\nmembers of the large sub-family of the Cystignathidae the otherwise\r\ncylindrical diapophyses are slightly dilated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.–Dorsal view of the sacral or ninth vertebra (9),\r\nwith the attachment of the ilium, of (1) _Rana temporaria_, (2) _Bufo\r\nvulgaris_, showing the whole coccyx and pelvis, (3) _Pelobates fuscus_, as\r\nexamples of cylindrical and of dilated sacral diapophyses. (About nat.\r\nsize.) _a_, Acetabulum; _c_, coccyx; _i_, ilium; _z_, anterior\r\nzygapophyses.]\r\n\r\nThe sacrum is formed by the ninth vertebra, but there are a few interesting\r\nexceptions. _Pelobates_, _Pipa_, and _Hymenochirus_ possess two sacral\r\nvertebrae; and, neglecting individual abnormalities, these three genera\r\nform the only exception amongst recent Amphibia. In the three genera the\r\ncoccyx is fused with the second sacral vertebra, and such a fusion occurs\r\nelsewhere normally only in _Bombinator_ with its single sacral vertebra.\r\nThe morphologically oldest condition is normally represented by\r\n_Pelobates_, the sacral vertebrae being the tenth and ninth. One case has\r\nbeen recorded by Boulenger of _Bombinator pachypus_ \"with eleven segments,\"\r\nthe last carrying the ilium. Individual lop-sided abnormalities have been\r\ndescribed in _Bombinator_ and _Alytes_, where the right ilium articulated\r\nwith the tenth, the left ilium with the ninth vertebra. This shifting\r\nforwards of the ilium to the extent of one metamere has been continued\r\nfurther in _Pipa_, in which the sacrum is formed by the ninth and eighth\r\nvertebrae, their diapophyses fusing on either side into extra broad\r\nwing-like expansions. In old specimens of _Palaeobatrachus fritschi_ the\r\nseventh vertebra is in a transitional condition, the ilium being carried by\r\nthe ninth and eighth, and slightly also by the diapophyses of the seventh\r\nvertebra; and in _P. diluvianus_ the {23}diapophyses of all these vertebrae\r\nare united into one broad plate to which the ilia are attached. Lastly, in\r\n_Hymenochirus_ the first sacral is the sixth vertebra, and this creature\r\nhas thereby reduced the pre-sacral vertebrae to the smallest number known.\r\n\r\nThis shifting forwards of the iliac attachment implies the conversion of\r\noriginal trunk into sacral vertebrae, and the original sacral vertebra\r\nitself becomes ultimately added to the urostyle. The second sacral, the\r\ntenth of _Pelobates_, the ninth of _Pipa_, and the tenth on the right side\r\nof the abnormal _Bombinator_, are still in a transitional stage of\r\nconversion. In Discoglossidae the tenth is already a typical post-sacral\r\nvertebra, and is added to the coccyx, but it still retains distinct, though\r\nshort, diapophyses. In the majority of the Anura the tenth vertebra has\r\nlost these processes, and its once separate nature is visible in young\r\nspecimens only. In _Bombinator_ even the eleventh vertebra is free during\r\nthe larval stage. In fact the whole coccyx is the result of the fusion of\r\nabout twelve or more vertebrae, which from behind forwards have lost their\r\nindividuality. We conclude that originally, in the early Anura, there was\r\nno coccyx, and that the ilium was attached much farther back; and this\r\ncondition, and the gradual shifting forwards, supply an intelligible cause\r\nof the formation of an os coccygeum. The fact that the sacral vertebrae of\r\nthe Anura possess no traces of ribs as carriers of the ilia, is also very\r\nsuggestive. The ilia have shifted into a region, the vertebrae of which had\r\nalready lost their ribs. By reconstructing the vertebral column of the\r\nAnura, by dissolving the coccyx into about a dozen vertebrae, so that\r\noriginally, say the twenty-first vertebra carried the ilia, we bridge over\r\nthe enormous gap which exists between the Anura and Urodela. That whole\r\nportion of the axial continuation behind the coccyx, more or less\r\ncoinciding with the position of the vent, is the transitional tail.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of both notochord and spinal cord, and the conversion of\r\nthe cartilaginous elements into a continuous rod in the case of the os\r\ncoccygeum, find an analogy in the hinder portion of the tail of Dipnoi and\r\nCrossopterygii, and in the tail-end of most Urodela, portions which are not\r\nhomologous with the os coccygeum. The term urostyle should be restricted to\r\nsuch and similar modifications of the tail-end, and this latter happens to\r\nbe lost by the Anura during metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n{24}Strictly speaking, or rather in anatomical parlance, the Vertebrate\r\ntail begins with the first post-sacral vertebra. In the Anura that portion\r\nof the whole tail has retained most cartilage, and has become the\r\ncoccygeum, which is required as a \"backbone\" for the often enormous belly.\r\nThis requirement is an outcome of the great shortening of the trunk proper\r\n(if the trunk be defined as ending with the pelvic region), and this\r\nshortening of the trunk is again intimately connected with the jumping\r\nmechanism, enlargement of the hind-limbs, elongation of the ilia, and\r\nthrowing the fulcral attachment forwards as much as possible. The\r\npre-acetabular ilio-sacral connection is carried to the extreme in the\r\nAnura.\r\n\r\nThe SHOULDER-GIRDLE and \"sternum\" are more complete than in the Urodela,\r\nthere being also a pair of clavicles, fused with the precoracoidal bars.\r\nThe whole apparatus presents two types. In the arciferous type the\r\ncoracoids and precoracoids retain a great amount of cartilage in their\r\ndistal portions, and these cartilages (the epicoracoids of some authors)\r\noverlap each other movably on one another, the right usually lying\r\nventrally upon the left. The epicoracoidal cartilage of each side, by\r\nconnecting the distal end of the coracoid with the precoracoid of the same\r\nside, forms an arc, hence \"arciferous.\" In the firmisternal type the\r\nepicoracoidal cartilages are much reduced, and, instead of overlapping,\r\nmeet in the middle line and often fuse with each other, forming thereby a\r\nfirm median bar, which connects the ventral ends of the precoracoids with\r\nthose of the coracoids. This type is morphologically the higher and more\r\nrecent, and passes in the larval stage through the arciferous condition. It\r\nis restricted to the Ranidae, Engystomatinae, and Aglossa. Although these\r\ntwo types afford an excellent distinctive character for the main divisions\r\nof the Anura, they are to a certain extent connected by intermediate forms\r\nin such a way, that, for instance, in _Bufo_ and among Cystignathidae in\r\n_Ceratophrys_, the two opposite epicoracoidal cartilages begin to unite at\r\nthe anterior end.\r\n\r\nIn many Engystomatinae the precoracoids together with the clavicles are\r\nmuch reduced, sometimes to thin ligaments, being in this case mostly curved\r\nback and lying closely against the coracoids; or they may be lost\r\ncompletely. Very rarely the precoracoidal bars are actually much stronger\r\nthan the coracoids, {25}and the median symphysial bar of cartilage is lost;\r\nthis is the case in _Hemisus_.\r\n\r\nThe scapula is always large and curved into transverse, dorsally broadening\r\nblades, the dorsal greater portion of which, the so-called supra-scapula,\r\ndoes not ossify but calcifies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.–Ventral views of the shoulder-girdles of various\r\nAnura.

The so-called sternal apparatus of the Anura consists of\r\ntwo pieces. One, anterior, variously named episternum, presternum, or\r\nomosternum, rests upon the united precoracoids and extends headwards, being\r\neither styliform or broadened out. Sometimes it is partly ossified, with a\r\ndistinct suture at its base; this is the case especially in the\r\nFirmisternia; in many Arcifera the omosternum remains cartilaginous and is\r\ncontinuous, without a sutural break, with the cartilage of the\r\nprecoracoids, indicating thereby its genetic relation to the\r\nshoulder-girdle. Hence _omosternum_ is the {26}preferable name. It is\r\nfrequently much reduced, even absent, for instance in most Bufonidae and in\r\nthe Engystomatinae. The posterior so-called sternal part may be termed\r\n_metasternum_. It forms the posterior counterpart of the omosternum. It is\r\nattached behind to the epicoracoidal cartilages, or fusing with them forms\r\ntheir posterior continuation. It appears mostly in the shape of a style,\r\nwhich is frequently ossified, and broadens out behind into a cartilaginous,\r\npartly calcified blade. In the Discoglossidae only it diverges backwards\r\ninto two horns, assuming a striking resemblance to the typical xiphisternum\r\nof the Amniota. In young Anura the metasternal cartilage is intimately\r\nconnected with the pericardium, an indication of its being derived not from\r\nribs but from the shoulder-girdle.\r\n\r\nThe glenoid cavity is always formed by the coracoids and by the scapula,\r\nbut the precoracoid often takes part in its formation, for instance in\r\nBufonidae, Hylidae, and Discoglossidae.\r\n\r\nIn the FORE-LIMB the humerus has a crest, stronger in the males than in the\r\nfemales; it assumes extraordinary strength in some Cystignathidae, notably\r\nin the male _Leptodactylus_. Radius and ulna are fused into one bone. The\r\ncarpalia are originally nine in number: radiale, ulnare, two centralia, and\r\nfive carpalia distalia, the fifth of which is reduced to a tiny nodule or\r\nto a ligamentous vestige. The primitive condition still prevails in the\r\nDiscoglossidae. In most of the other Anura the fourth and third distal\r\ncarpalia, in any case very small, fuse with the enlarged ulnar centrale;\r\nthe radial centrale comes, in the Bufonidae and Pelobatidae, into contact\r\nwith the radius, so that the forearm articulates with three elements as in\r\nthe Urodela, but with this difference, that the intermedium of the Urodela\r\nhas been lost by the Anura. There are five metacarpalia and five fingers,\r\nbut the elements of the first or thumb are nearly vestigial, so that the\r\npollux is reduced to one or two nodules, scarcely visible externally. The\r\nnormal number of the phalanges of the second to fifth fingers is 2, 2, 3,\r\n3. The distal phalanges are generally straight, either pointed or expanded\r\nor with Y or T-shaped ends; but in the Hylidae, in _Hylambates_ amongst the\r\nRanidae, and in _Ceratohyla_, one of the Hemiphractinae, the terminal\r\nphalanges are produced into curved claws which support the adhesive\r\nfinger-discs. There are, however, many genera of different families, which\r\npossess finger-discs and have no claw-shaped {27}phalanges. The Hylidae,\r\nand many of the climbing members of the Ranidae with adhesive discs,\r\npossess an extra skeletal piece intercalated between the last and last but\r\none phalanges of the fingers and toes. This piece, a mere interarticular\r\ncartilage in _Hyla_, is in the following Raninae developed into an\r\nadditional phalanx, so that their numbers are 3, 3, 4, 4 in the hand and 3,\r\n3, 4, 5, 4 in the foot: _Cassina_, _Hylambates_, _Rappia_, _Megalixalus_,\r\n_Rhacophorus_, _Chiromantis_, _Ixalus_, and _Nyctixalus_. All the other\r\nRanidae are without this additional phalanx, irrespective of the presence\r\nor absence or size of digital expansions.[12]\r\n\r\nThe PELVIC GIRDLE looks like a pair of tongs (see Fig. 4, p. 22). The ilium\r\nis enormously elongated and is movably attached to the sacral diapophyses.\r\nThis connection is always pre-acetabular in position. The ilium and ischium\r\nco-ossify completely, and make up nearly the whole of the pelvis; the pubis\r\nis very small, and remains cartilaginous unless it calcifies. It rarely\r\npossesses a centre of ossification, for instance in _Pelobates_, where the\r\nosseous nodule is excluded from the acetabulum, recalling certain\r\nLabyrinthodonta, whose ossa pubis likewise do not reach that cavity. The\r\nlatter is open or perforated in young Anura and remains so in the\r\nDiscoglossidae, but in the others it becomes closed up as in the Urodela.\r\nThe ventral halves of the pelvis, besides forming a symphysis, closely\r\napproach each other, just leaving room for the passage of the rectum and\r\nthe urino-genital ducts.\r\n\r\nThe HIND-LIMBS are in all cases longer than the fore-limbs. The femur is\r\nslender, the tibia and fibula are fused into one bone. The tarsus is much\r\nmodified by the great elongation of the two proximal tarsalia (there being\r\nno intermedium) into an astragalus and a calcaneum, both of which fuse\r\ntogether distally and proximally, or completely as in _Pelodytes_; in the\r\nlatter case the limb assumes a unique appearance, since it consists of\r\nthree successive and apparently single bars of nearly equal length. The\r\nother tarsal elements, especially the more lateral ones, are practically\r\nreduced to pads. The Anura have thereby acquired two well-marked joints,\r\none cruro-tarsal, the other tarso-metatarsal; this shows a high stage of\r\nspecialisation in comparison with the Urodelous and Stegocephalous type of\r\nstill undefined joints.\r\n\r\n{28}The Anura possesses five well-developed toes with normally 2, 2, 3, 4,\r\nand 3 phalanges, and the rudiments of a sixth digit, the so-called\r\nprehallux, which consists of from two to four pieces, including the one\r\nwhich represents its metatarsal. This prehallux, as a vestige of a once\r\nbetter developed digit, is exactly like the elements on the radial side of\r\nthe wrist, which, we are certain, are the remnants of a once complete\r\nfinger, namely the pollex. The only weighty difficulty against its\r\ninterpretation as a prehallux lies in the fact that hitherto no six-toed\r\nStegocephali have been found; but the fact that there are no Stegocephali\r\nknown with more than four fingers could be used as an argument against\r\nthere being a pollex-vestige in recent Anura with just as little reason.\r\n\r\nThe SKULL of the Anura differs from that of the other recent Amphibia in\r\nthe following features:–\r\n\r\nThe orbital region of the primitive cranium remains cartilaginous, but\r\nfurther forward the cranial cavity is closed by the unpaired sphenethmoid,\r\nwhich forms a ring round the anterior portion of the brain-cavity, hence\r\ncalled \"os en ceinture\" by some anatomists. The frontals and parietals fuse\r\ninto one pair of fronto-parietal bones, and these again can fuse together\r\nin the middle line; as in Aglossa and _Pelobates_. The palatal portion of\r\nthe palato-quadrate cartilage is complete, reaching forwards to the sides\r\nof the ethmoid region. The curved arch, formed by this cartilage, is\r\ncovered by the following bones: (1) the quadrato-jugal, reduced to a thin\r\nsplint which connects the quadrate and squamosal with the posterior end of\r\nthe maxilla; (2) the pterygoid, always strong, extending from the distal\r\ninner corner of the quadrate to the maxilla, sometimes also to the\r\npalatine, and with a broad, median process to the parasphenoid, this\r\nprocess covering ventrally most of the otic region; (3) the palatines,\r\nwhich vary considerably in shape and size; they are placed transversely and\r\nmeet in the middle line; in _Bombinator_ and _Pelodytes_ they are absent.\r\n\r\nThe quadrates are directed transversely and backwards, in conformity with\r\nthe wide gape of the mouth. The squamosal is always well developed,\r\ncovering the whole of the quadrate on its outer side; it has a forwardly\r\ndirected process which ends freely in _Rana_, meets a corresponding process\r\nof the maxilla and forms a bony arch with it in _Discoglossus_,\r\n_Pelobates_, and others, or {29}is scarcely developed at all, for instance\r\nin _Bufo_. In _Pelobates cultripes_ the squamosal is very wide and forms a\r\njunction with the fronto-parietals, thus producing a broad bridge across\r\nthe temporal fossa.\r\n\r\nThe nasal bones are large and meet in the middle line. Frequently they\r\nleave a space between them and the diverging anterior portion of the\r\nfronto-parietals, through which gap appears part of the dorsal surface of\r\nthe ethmoid cartilage. A fontanelle between the frontals occurs in most\r\nHylidae, many Cystignathidae, some few Bufonidae, in _Pelodytes_ amongst\r\nthe Pelobatidae, and in the Discoglossidae.\r\n\r\nThe tympanic cavity is bordered in front, above, and below by the squamosal\r\nand quadrate, behind by the musculus depressor mandibulae, internally by\r\nthe otic capsule, and by the cartilage of the cranium between this and the\r\nlateral occipital bone. The cavity communicates, however, by the wide and\r\nshort Eustachian tube with the mouth, the passage being bordered anteriorly\r\nby the pterygoid, posteriorly by soft parts. Partly imbedded in these soft\r\ntissues is the styloid process or stylohyal, which is attached to the\r\ncranium, mostly behind the otic region, and is continued downwards into the\r\nanterior horn of the hyoid. The whole partly cartilaginous, ligamentous,\r\nand osseous string is, in fact, the entire ventral half of the hyoid arch,\r\nwhile the dorsal half or hyomandibular portion of this, the second visceral\r\narch, is modified into the columellar or auditory chain. The inner end of\r\nthis chain, the stapes, is inserted into and around the fenestra ovalis of\r\nthe otic capsule, while the outer end is somewhat T-shaped, and is loosely\r\nattached to or near the upper rim of the tympanic ring and to the middle of\r\nthe tympanic disc. In many Anura this terminal bar can be seen from the\r\noutside. The middle portion of the columellar chain is ossified, the rest\r\nremains cartilaginous. But the whole chain exhibits various modifications\r\nin different genera, especially in the number and the extent of the\r\nprocesses sent out by the outer cartilaginous portion; these are attached\r\nin various ways to the tympanum and its rims. The tympanic disc is carried\r\nby a cartilaginous ring, which rests against a special process sent out by\r\nthe quadrate, and is probably itself a differentiation of this element.\r\n\r\nIn some very aquatic genera, but also in _Pelobates_, the {30}tympanic\r\ncavity is much reduced, for instance in _Bombinator_, _Liopelma_. In\r\n_Batrachophrynus_ not only the cavity, but also the Eustachian tubes are\r\nsuppressed. In the Aglossa only the two tubes are united into one short but\r\nwide median canal, opening at the level of the pterygoids on the roof of\r\nthe mouth.\r\n\r\nThe lower jaw is remarkable for the possession of mento-Meckelian\r\ncartilages, absent only in the Aglossa and Discoglossidae. At first they\r\nare much longer than the rest of the jaw; during the larval life they\r\nindeed form the functional jaw, and they are now covered with horny sheaths\r\ninstead of teeth. Owing to the absence of teeth on them, these\r\nmento-Meckelian cartilages are later not invested by bone, although in many\r\nAnura they ultimately ossify, either retaining their separate nature or\r\nfusing partly with the dentary bones. The bulk of the lower jaw, the\r\nMeckelian cartilage, becomes invested by the dentary, a small articulare,\r\nand an inner angulare, while a splenial element is absent. The dentary\r\nitself is mostly reduced to a small dentigerous splint, while the angulare\r\nforms by far the greater part of the bony jaw.\r\n\r\nTeeth are more restricted in their occurrence than in the Urodela. On the\r\njaws they always stand in one row. With the exception of the\r\nHemiphractinae, Amphignathodontinae, Ceratobatrachinae, and Genyophryninae,\r\nno recent Anura carry teeth on the lower jaw, and even in these genera they\r\nare mostly much reduced in size and firmness, having all the appearance of\r\nvanishing structures. The premaxillae and maxillae are frequently furnished\r\nwith teeth, except in the Dendrobatinae, Genyophryninae, Engystomatinae,\r\nDendrophryniscinae, Bufonidae, _Pipa_, and _Hymenochirus_. The vomers\r\nmostly carry a series of teeth on their posterior border; when these teeth\r\nare absent, as in many species of _Bufo_, a kind of substitute sometimes\r\noccurs on the palatines in the shape of a row of tuberosities. The\r\npalatines carry teeth in Hemiphractinae. The parasphenoids are rarely\r\ntoothed, _e.g._ _Triprion_, _Diaglena_, _Amphodus_, and occasionally in\r\n_Pelobates_.\r\n\r\nA few Anura possess peculiar substitutes for teeth in the anterior portion\r\nof the lower jaw, namely, a pair of conical bony processes, sometimes\r\nrather long, but always covered by the dense gums, or investment of the\r\njaws; _e.g._ _Lepidobatrachus_, several Rana, _e.g._ _R. adspersa_, _R.\r\nkhasiana_, _R. kuhli_, and _Cryptotis brevis_.\r\n\r\n{31}Cranial dermal ossifications are developed in some species of _Bufo_,\r\nstill more in the Hemiphractinae, and above all in _Pelobates cultripes_\r\nand in the Cystignathoid genus _Calyptocephalus_.\r\n\r\nThe HYOID APPARATUS of the Anura is complicated. It is originally composed\r\nof the hyoidean and four branchial arches, with one median, copular piece.\r\nThe branchial arches form in the early life of the tadpole the elaborate\r\nframework of the filtering apparatus mentioned on p. 44. During\r\nmetamorphosis the whole filter disappears, owing to resorption of the\r\ngreater part of the branchial arches; only their median portions remain,\r\nand fuse with the enlarged copular piece and the hyoidean arches into a\r\nbroad shield-shaped cartilage (_corpus linguae_), whence several lateral\r\nprocesses sprout out, the posterior pair of which are generally called\r\nthyrohyals or thyroid horns. The true hyoid horns give up their larval\r\nlean-to articulation with the quadrate, become greatly elongated, and gain\r\na new attachment on the otic region of the cranium. The transformation of\r\nthe whole apparatus has been studied minutely by Ridewood, in _Pelodytes\r\npunctatus_.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nSKIN\r\n\r\nThe epidermis of the young larvae of Amphibia is furnished with cilia,\r\nwhich later on are suppressed by the development of a thin hyaline layer or\r\ncuticula, but clusters of such cilia remain, at least during the larval\r\nlife and during the periodical aquatic life of the adult, in the epidermal\r\nsense-organs. In the frog, currents are set up by the ciliary action at an\r\nearlier stage, and are maintained to a later stage than in the newt. In the\r\nlatter the tail loses its ciliation, whereas in the frog it remains active\r\nalmost up to the time of the metamorphosis. In tadpoles of 3-10 mm. nearly\r\nthe whole surface is ciliated (Assheton).[14] The cilia work from head to\r\ntail, causing the little animal, when perfectly quiet, to move forwards\r\nslowly in the water. Beneath the cuticula, in the Perennibranchiata and the\r\nlarvae of the other Urodela, lies a somewhat thicker layer of vertically\r\nstriated cells, the so-called pseudo-cuticula, which disappears with the\r\ntransformation of the upper layers of the Malpighian cells into the stratum\r\ncorneum. The latter is very thin, consists of one or two layers of\r\nflattened cells, and is shed periodically by all {32}Amphibia in one piece.\r\nIn the Urodela it generally breaks loose around the mouth, and the animal\r\nslips out of the delicate, transparent, colourless \"shirt,\" which during\r\nthis process of ecdysis or moulting becomes inverted. In the Anura it\r\nmostly breaks along the middle line of the back, the creature struggles out\r\nof it, pokes it into its mouth, and swallows it. Urodela also eat this\r\nskin. As a rule the first ecdysis takes place towards the end of the\r\nmetamorphosis, preparatory to terrestrial life. So long as the animal grows\r\nrapidly, the skin has to be shed frequently, since this corneous layer is\r\npractically dead and unyielding. Adult terrestrial Urodela do not seem to\r\nmoult often, mostly only when they take to the water in the breeding\r\nseason. Anura, on the other hand, moult often on land, at least every few\r\nmonths. The surface of the new skin is then quite moist and slimy, but it\r\nsoon dries and hardens.\r\n\r\nThe Malpighian stratum consists of several layers, thickest in the\r\nPerennibranchiata; in them it contains mucous cells throughout life, in\r\nothers such slime-cells are restricted to larval life. Later, regular\r\nslime-glands are developed, which open on the surface. They are very\r\nnumerous, and more evenly distributed, over most parts of the body, than\r\nthe specific or poison-glands, which are restricted to certain parts, often\r\nforming large clusters, especially on the sides of the body. They reach\r\ntheir greatest development in the \"parotoid glands\" of the Anura. Both\r\nkinds of glands are furnished with smooth muscle-fibres, which are said to\r\narise from the basal membrane underlying and forming part of the Malpighian\r\nlayer; these muscle-cells extend later downwards into the corium. For the\r\naction of the poison, see p. 37.\r\n\r\nThe stratum corneum is mostly thin, but on many parts of the body,\r\nespecially in Anura, the epidermal cells proliferate and form hard spikes\r\nor other rugosities, generally stained dark brown. With these may be\r\ngrouped the nuptial excrescences so frequent in the Anura, especially on\r\nthe rudiment of the thumb, and on the under surface of the joints of the\r\nfingers and toes. In many Anura, less frequently in the Urodela, the tips\r\nof the fingers and toes are encased in thicker horny sheaths, producing\r\nclaws or nails. They are best developed among newts in _Onychodactylus_,\r\namong the Anura in _Xenopus_ and _Hymenochirus_. The horny covering of the\r\nmetatarsal tubercles reaches its greatest size in {33}the digging spur or\r\nspade of _Pelobates_. In most of these cases the cutis is elevated into\r\nmore or less wart-like papillae, covered, of course, by the proliferated\r\nand cornified epidermis. In the female of _Rana temporaria_ nearly the\r\nwhole surface of the body becomes covered with rosy papillae during the\r\nbreeding season. Similar nuptial excrescences are common, and are most\r\nnoteworthy in the male of the Indian _Rana liebigi_.\r\n\r\nThe epidermis also contains sense-organs. They attain their highest\r\ndevelopment in the larvae; later on they undergo a retrogressive change.\r\nEach of these sense-organs is a little cup-shaped papilla, visible to the\r\nnaked eye. It is composed of elongated cells which form a mantle around\r\nsome central cells, each of which ends in a stiff cilium perforating a\r\nthin, hyaline membrane which lines the bottom of the cup, and is perhaps\r\nthe representation of the cuticula. These ciliated cells are connected with\r\nsensory fibres, the nerve entering at the bottom of the whole organ. The\r\ncilia are in direct contact with the water, but the outer rim of the whole\r\napparatus is protected by a short tube of hyaline cuticula-like secretion.\r\nThese sense-organs are, in the larvae, scattered over the head, especially\r\nnear the mouth and around the eyes, whence they extend backwards on to the\r\ntail, mostly in three pairs of longitudinal rows, one near the vertebral\r\ncolumn, the others lateral. They are supplied by the lateral branch of the\r\nvagus nerve. They disappear during the metamorphosis, at least in the\r\nAnura, with the exception of _Xenopus_, in which they form conspicuous\r\nwhite objects. The white colour is caused by the tubes becoming choked with\r\nthe débris of cells or coagulating mucous matter, so that it is doubtful if\r\nthese organs, which moreover have sunk deeper into the skin, are still\r\nfunctional. In the terrestrial Urodela these organs undergo a periodical\r\nprocess of retrogression and rejuvenescence. During the life on land they\r\nshrink and withdraw from the surface, and their nerves likewise diminish,\r\nbut in the breeding season, when the newts take again to aquatic life, they\r\nrevive, are rebuilt and become prominent on the surface. They are an\r\ninheritance from the fishes, in which such lateral line organs are\r\nuniversally present.\r\n\r\nThe cutis of most Amphibia is very rich in lymph-spaces, which, especially\r\nin the Anura, assume enormous proportions, since the so-called subcutaneous\r\nconnective tissue forms {34}comparatively few vertical septa by which the\r\nupper and denser layers, the corium proper, are connected with the\r\nunderlying muscles. The spaces are filled with lymph, and into some of them\r\nthe abnormally expanded vocal sacs extend, notably in _Paludicola_,\r\n_Leptodactylus_, and other Cystignathidae, and in _Rhinoderma_.\r\n\r\nThe cutis frequently forms papillae and prominent folds, sometimes regular\r\nlongitudinal keels on the sides of the back; but dermal, more or less\r\ncalcified or ossified scales are restricted to the Stegocephali and to the\r\nApoda, _q.v._, pp. 79, 87. We conclude that the Urodela and Anura have\r\nentirely lost these organs. Dermal ossifications, besides those which now\r\nform an integral part of the skeleton, like many of the cranial\r\nmembrane-bones, are rare, and are restricted to the Anura. They are least\r\ninfrequent on the head, where the skin is more or less involved in the\r\nossification of the underlying membrane-bones, for instance in _Triprion_,\r\n_Calyptocephalus_, _Hemiphractus_ and _Pelobates_. The thick ossifications\r\nin the skin of the back of several species of _Ceratophrys_ are very\r\nexceptional. In _Brachycephalus ephippium_ these dermal bones enter into\r\nconnection with the vertebrae; small plates fuse with the dorsal processes\r\nof the first to third vertebrae, while one large and thick plate fuses with\r\nthe rest of the dorsal vertebrae. Simple calcareous deposits in the cutis\r\nare less uncommon, for instance, in old specimens of _Bufo vulgaris_. We\r\nare scarcely justified in looking upon these various calcifications and\r\neven ossifications as reminiscences of Stegocephalous conditions.\r\n\r\nThe skin contains PIGMENT. This is either diffuse or granular. Diffuse\r\npigment, mostly dark brown or yellow, occurs frequently in the epidermis,\r\neven in the stratum corneum. The granular pigment is stored up in cells,\r\nthe chromatophores, which send out amœboid processes, and are restricted to\r\nthe cutis, mostly to its upper stratum, where they make their first\r\nappearance. Contraction of the chromatophores withdraws the pigment from\r\nthe surface, expansion distributes it more or less equally. The usual\r\ncolours of the pigment are black, brown, yellow, and red. Green and blue\r\nare merely subjective colours, due to interference. A peculiar kind of\r\ncolouring matter is the white pigment, which probably consists of guanine,\r\nand is likewise deposited within cells; cf. the description of the white\r\nspots in the skin of _Hyla coerulea_.\r\n\r\n{35}Most Amphibia are capable of changing colour, the Urodela, however, far\r\nless than the Anura, some of which exhibit an extraordinary range and\r\nadaptability in their changes.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism by which the change of colour is produced in frogs has been\r\nrecently studied by Biedermann.[15] If we examine the green skin of the\r\ncommon Tree-frog, _Hyla arborea_, under a low power and direct light, we\r\nsee a mosaic of green, polygonal areas, separated by dark lines and\r\ninterrupted by the openings of the skin-glands. Seen from below the skin\r\nappears black. Under a stronger power the black layer is seen to be\r\ncomposed of anastomosing and ramified black pigment-cells. Where the light\r\nshines through, the skin appears yellow. The epidermis itself is quite\r\ncolourless. The mosaic layer is composed of polygonal interference-cells,\r\neach of which consists of a basal half which is granular and colourless,\r\nwhile the upper half is made up of yellow drops. Sometimes the tree-frog\r\nappears blackish, and if then the black pigment-cells are induced to\r\ncontract, for instance, by warming the frog, it appears silver-grey; in\r\nthis case the pigment in the yellow drops is no longer diffuse, but is\r\nconcentrated into a round lump lodged between the interstices of the\r\ngranular portions; the black pigment-cells are likewise balled together.\r\nThese black chromatophores send out numerous fine branches, which\r\noccasionally stretch between and round the polygonal cells. When each of\r\nthese is quite surrounded and covered by the black processes, the frog\r\nappears black. On the other hand, when the black pigment-cells withdraw\r\ntheir processes, shrink up, and, so to speak, retire, then the light which\r\npasses through the yellow drops is, by interference, broken into green.\r\n\r\nStoppage of the circulation of the blood in the skin causes the black\r\nchromatophores to contract. Carbon dioxide paralyses them and causes them\r\nto dilate. This is direct influence without the action of nerves. But\r\nstimulation of the central nerve-centres makes the skin turn pale. Low\r\ntemperature causes expansion, high temperature contraction, of the\r\nchromatophores. Hence hibernating frogs are much darker than they are in\r\nthe summer. Frogs kept in dry moss, or such as have escaped into the room\r\nand dry up, turn pale, regardless of light or darkness, probably owing to a\r\ncentral, reflex, nerve-stimulus.\r\n\r\nTree-frogs turn green as the result of the contact with leaves. {36}Dark\r\nfrogs will turn green when put into an absolutely dark vessel in which\r\nthere are leaves. This is reflex action, and blinded specimens do the same.\r\nThe principal centres of the nerves which control the chromatophores, lie\r\nin the corpora bigemina and in the optic thalami of the brain. When these\r\ncentres are destroyed, the frog no longer changes colour when put upon\r\nleaves, but if a nerve, for instance the sciatic, be stimulated, the\r\ncorresponding portion of the body, in this case the leg, turns green. Rough\r\nsurfaces cause a sensation which makes the frog turn dark. _Rana_ seems to\r\ndepend chiefly upon temperature and the amount of moisture in the air, so\r\nfar as its changes of colour are concerned. Biedermann concludes that the\r\n\"chromatic function of frogs in general depends chiefly upon the sensory\r\nimpressions received by the skin, while that of fishes depends upon the\r\neye.\"\r\n\r\nAll this sounds very well, but the observations and experiments are such as\r\nare usual in physiological laboratories, and the frogs, when observed in\r\ntheir native haunts, or even when kept under proper conditions, do not\r\nalways behave as the physiologist thinks they should. There is no doubt\r\nthat in many cases the changes of colour are not voluntary, but reflex\r\nactions. It is quite conceivable that the sensation of sitting on a rough\r\nsurface starts a whole train of processes: roughness means bark, bark is\r\nbrown, change into brown; but one and the same tree-frog does not always\r\nassume the colour of the bark when it rests, or even sleeps upon, such a\r\npiece. He will, if it suits him, remain grass-green upon a yellow stone, or\r\non a white window-frame. I purposely describe such conditions, changes,\r\ncoincidences, and discrepancies in various species, notably in _Hyla\r\narborea_, _H. coerulea_, _Rana temporaria_, _Bufo viridis_, to show that in\r\nmany cases the creature knows what it is about, and that the eye plays a\r\nvery important part in the decision of what colour is to be produced. The\r\nsensory impression received through the skin of the belly is the same, no\r\nmatter if the board be painted white, black, or green, and how does it then\r\ncome to pass that the frog adjusts its colour to a nicety to the general\r\nhue or tone of its surroundings?\r\n\r\nBoulenger[16] has given us a summary of the action of the POISON of\r\nAmphibia:\r\n\r\n{37}It is well known to all who have handled freshly-caught newts, and\r\ncertain toads, especially _Bombinator_, that their secretion acts as a\r\nsternutatory, and causes irritation of the nose and eyes, the effects\r\nproduced on us by _Bombinator_ being comparable to the early stages of a\r\ncold in the head. Many collectors of Batrachians have learned, to their\r\ndiscomfiture, how the introduction of examples of certain species into the\r\nbag containing the sport of their excursion may cause the death of the\r\nother prisoners; for although the poison has no effect on the skin of\r\nindividuals of the same species, different species, however closely allied,\r\nmay poison each other by mere contact. But when inoculated the poison acts\r\neven on the same individual.\r\n\r\nMiss Ormerod, to personally test the effect, pressed part of the back and\r\ntail of a live Crested Newt between the teeth. \"The first effect was a\r\nbitter astringent feeling in the mouth, with irritation of the upper part\r\nof the throat, numbing of the teeth more immediately holding the animal,\r\nand in about a minute from the first touch of the newt a strong flow of\r\nsaliva. This was accompanied by much foam and violent spasmodic action,\r\napproaching convulsions, but entirely confined to the mouth itself. The\r\nexperiment was immediately followed by headache lasting for some hours,\r\ngeneral discomfort of the system, and half an hour after by slight\r\nshivering fits.\"\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments have shown that the poison of toads, salamanders, and\r\nnewts is capable, when injected, of killing mammals, birds, reptiles, and\r\neven fishes, provided, of course, that the dose be proportionate to the\r\nsize of the animal. Small birds and lizards succumb as a rule in a few\r\nminutes; guinea-pigs, rabbits, and dogs in less than an hour.\r\n\r\nThis poison of Amphibia is not septic, but acts upon the heart and the\r\ncentral nervous system. That of the common toad has been compared, in its\r\neffects, to that of _Digitalis_ and _Erythrophlaeum_. Some authorities hold\r\nthat the poison is an acid, others regard it as an alkaloid.\r\n\r\nPhisalix[17] has come to the conclusion that toads and salamanders are\r\npossessed of two kinds of glands, different both anatomically and\r\nphysiologically. These are, first the mucous glands, spread over the\r\ngreater part of the body, with an alkaloid secretion, which acts as a\r\nnarcotic; secondly, specific glands, as {38}the parotoids and larger dorsal\r\nglands, the secretion of which is acid, and acts as a convulsive.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Colombia are said to employ the secretion of _Dendrobates\r\ntinctorius_ for poisoning their arrows. The poison is obtained by exposing\r\nthe frog to a fire, and after being scraped off the back is sufficient for\r\npoisoning fifty arrows. It acts on the central nervous system, and is used\r\nespecially for shooting monkeys. Concerning the use of this poison for\r\n\"dyeing\" parrots, see p. 272.\r\n\r\nThe milky secretion of toads protects them against many enemies, although\r\nnot always against the grass-snake. A dog which has once been induced to\r\nbite a toad, suffers so severely that it will not easily repeat the\r\nexperiment. The handling of tree-frogs also irritates both nose and eyes.\r\nThe hind limbs of the Water-frog, _Rana esculenta_, have a very bitter,\r\nacrid taste. In short, most, if not all, Amphibia are more or less\r\npoisonous, and it is significant that many of the most poisonous, e.g.\r\n_Salamandra maculosa_, _Bombinator_, _Dendrobates_, exhibit that very\r\nconspicuous combination of yellow or orange upon a dark ground, which is so\r\nwidespread a sign of poison. Other instances of such warning colours,\r\nprotective in a defensive sense, are the Wasps and _Heloderma_, the only\r\npoisonous lizard.\r\n\r\n\r\nNERVES\r\n\r\nSPINAL NERVES.–Each spinal nerve issues originally immediately behind the\r\nneural arch of the vertebral segment to which it belongs. This\r\nintra-vertebral position is ultimately modified into a more inter-vertebral\r\none, owing to the predominant share of the neural arches, basidorsalia, in\r\nthe composition of the whole vertebra. Consequently the nerves issue behind\r\ntheir corresponding vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe first spinal nerve, or N. suboccipitalis, is exceptional in several\r\nrespects. It develops a dorsal and a ventral root like a typical spinal\r\nnerve, but the dorsal root soon degenerates in all Amphibia, while in the\r\nPhaneroglossal Anura the whole nerve disappears. The first spinal nerve\r\nreduced to its ventral half persists therefore only in the Apoda, Urodela,\r\nand the Aglossal Anura. It issues originally between the occiput and the\r\natlas, but in the adult it is partly imbedded in the anterior portion of\r\nthe atlas. Its own vertebra is lost, having probably been added to the\r\ncranium.\r\n\r\n{39}In the Urodela the first spinal nerve either remains separate, or it\r\njoins the second spinal, forming with it and with a branch from the third\r\nnerve the cervical plexus, which supplies the muscles of the cervical\r\nregion. The third, fourth, and fifth nerves, and sometimes also the sixth,\r\nform the brachial plexus.\r\n\r\nIn the Aglossal Anura N. spinalis I. mostly sends a fine thread to the\r\nsecond spinal nerve, the rest supplies chiefly the M. levator scapulae, in\r\n_Pipa_ the abdominal muscles also. In all the other Anura this N. spinalis\r\nI. is lost; occasional vestiges have been reported in _Bufo vulgaris_ and\r\n_Rana catesbiana_, and remnants of it may possibly be found in Pelobatidae\r\nand Discoglossidae. The first actually persisting nerve of the\r\nPhaneroglossa is consequently N. spinalis II.\r\n\r\nThe brachial plexus is composed as follows:–_Pipa_, N. spinalis II. and\r\nIII.; _Xenopus_ and Phaneroglossa, N. spinalis III. and IV., with a small\r\nbranch from the second; the next following three nerves, numbers V., VI.,\r\nand VII., behave like ordinary trunk nerves.\r\n\r\nThe pelvic plexus of the Phaneroglossa is formed in _Rana_ by the VIII. +\r\nIX. + X. + XIth nerves, the tenth issuing between the sacral vertebra and\r\nthe coccyx. In _Bufo_ and _Hyla_ the plexus is composed of five nerves, the\r\nseventh spinal sending a branch to it. Occasionally the twelfth nerve\r\ncontributes a small branch to the posterior portion of the plexus. This and\r\nthe eleventh nerve leave the coccyx by separate holes, thereby indicating\r\nits composition. The rest of the spinal cord gives off no more recognisable\r\nnerves, owing to its reduction during the later stages of metamorphosis;\r\nits terminal filament passes out of the posterior end of the coccygeal\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nConcerning the CRANIAL NERVES it is necessary to draw attention to one\r\npoint only. The last nerve which leaves the cranium of the Amphibia is the\r\nvagus or tenth cranial nerve. There is consequently no eleventh, and no\r\ntwelfth or hypoglossal, pair of cranial nerves. Their homologues would be\r\nthe first and second spinal nerves, but the whole tongue of the Amphibia,\r\nwith its muscles, is supplied by the glossopharyngeal, or ninth cranial\r\npair, and is morphologically not homologous with the tongue of the Amniota.\r\n\r\n\r\n{40}RESPIRATORY ORGANS\r\n\r\nA very important and characteristic feature of the Amphibia is the\r\ndevelopment of two sets of respiratory organs: Gills and Lungs. It is as\r\nwell to give definitions of these organs. _Lungs_ are hollow evaginations\r\nfrom the ventral wall of the pharynx, and their thin, vascularised walls\r\nenable the blood to exchange, by osmosis, carbon dioxide for oxygen from\r\nthe air which enters the lungs by the mouth or the nostrils, and the\r\nwindpipe. The latter is unpaired, the lungs themselves are paired. _Gills_\r\nare highly vascularised, more or less ramified excrescences, covered by a\r\nthin epithelium of ecto- or endo-dermal origin, which permits of the\r\nexchange of carbon dioxide for oxygen from the air which is suspended in\r\nthe surrounding water. It is obvious that this definition applies to all\r\nsorts of well-vascularised organs whose thin surface comes into contact\r\nwith the water. Various recesses of the pharyngeal cavity, the dorsal and\r\nventral folds of the tail-fin, nay, even any part of the skin of the body\r\ncan, and does occasionally, assume additional respiratory functions. The\r\nproper definition of gills, in Vertebrates, requires, therefore, the\r\nrestriction that they must be developed upon and carried by visceral\r\narches.\r\n\r\nThe general statement that the Amphibia breathe by lungs, and, at least\r\nduring some stage of their life, also by gills, requires various\r\nrestrictions. As a rule the majority of Amphibia first develop gills, later\r\non also lungs, whereupon, during the metamorphosis, the gills are gradually\r\nsuppressed, so that the perfect animal breathes by lungs only (see p. 61).\r\nBut a number of Urodela retain their gills throughout life, although the\r\nlungs are also functional. These are the Perennibranchiata, not a natural\r\ngroup, but a heterogenous assembly, Proteidae and Sirenidae. Some species\r\nof _Amblystoma_ remain individually Perennibranchiate (cf. Axolotl,\r\np. 112). On the other hand, in some Anura the gills are almost or entirely\r\nsuppressed, or restricted to the embryonic period only. Lastly, a\r\nconsiderable number of Salamandridae have lost their lungs; they breathe by\r\ngills until their metamorphosis, but have in the adult state to resort to\r\nrespiration by the skin (cf. p. 46).\r\n\r\nThe general plan of the development of the branchial respiratory apparatus\r\nis as follows:–The six visceral arches, {41}namely, the mandibular, the\r\nhyoidean, and the four branchial arches, correspond, long before they are\r\ncartilaginous, with four main arterial arches of the truncus arteriosus.\r\nThe first, the arteria hyo-mandibularis, belongs to the hyoidean and\r\nmandibular segments, the second to the first branchial, the third to the\r\nsecond branchial, while the fourth soon splits in two for the third and\r\nfourth or last branchial arch. On the dorsal side these branchial arterial\r\narches combine to form the radix of the dorsal aorta. These arches,\r\nespecially the three branchials, appear in newts, less clearly in frogs, as\r\ntransverse ridges on the sides of the future neck. Between the arches the\r\npharynx gradually bulges out in the shape of five lateral gill-pouches; the\r\nfirst between the mandibular and the hyoidean arch, the second between the\r\nhyoidean and the first branchial arch, etc. These pouches soon break\r\nthrough to the outside and become gill-clefts, except the first pouch in\r\nUrodela. _Before_ the breaking through of the clefts there appears upon the\r\noutside of the middle of the rim of each arch a little knob, which soon\r\nramifies and forms an external gill. The knob owes its origin to the\r\ndevelopment of a blood-vessel which buds from the arterial arch, ramifies\r\nand breaks up into capillaries, and returns a little further dorsalwards\r\ninto the arch. A secondary loop to the outside of the primary arterial arch\r\nis thus formed; and whilst this outer loop sprouts out further, driving\r\nbefore it the likewise proliferating skin, and thus producing the gill, the\r\nmiddle portion of the primary arch remains in the Urodela as a short cut,\r\nbut in the Anura it partly obliterates, and henceforth acts as the internal\r\n_efferent_ vessel of the gill. When, during metamorphosis, the gills\r\ndisappear, their intrinsic _afferent_ and _efferent_ vessels vanish\r\nlikewise, and the short cut completes the circuit. In order to do this they\r\nhave, in the Anura, to form new connections with the trunks of the afferent\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nThe arterial arches themselves are modified as follows:–The first pair\r\nbecome the carotids, the second form the right and left aortic arches,\r\nwhile the third and fourth unite and are transformed into the pulmonary\r\narteries and \"ductus Botalli,\" the last arterial arch having previously\r\nsent a branch into the developing lungs. In the Anura the third arch\r\nobliterates.\r\n\r\nThe gills and clefts present various modifications. The Urodela possess\r\nthree pairs of gills, one each upon the dorsal {42}half of the three\r\nbranchial arches, just near the upper corners of the clefts; and the skin\r\nof the body is continued upon the stem of each gill, pigmented like the\r\nrest of the surface of the body. Such a gill is more or less like a blade,\r\nstanding vertically, and is composed of a stem of connective tissue, thick\r\nat the base, and, as a rule, carrying two series of fine lamellae, which,\r\nhowever, do not form two opposite series, but hang downwards, being, so to\r\nspeak, folded down, so that the upper surface of the stem is bare, and\r\ncarries the lamellae on its under side. In the Axolotl some of these\r\nlamellae are further subdivided. In _Necturus_ they are enormously\r\nincreased in numbers, but are rather short, and they stand no longer in two\r\nrows, but are crowded into one. Those of _Proteus_ form two rows of\r\ndendritic filaments; those of _Siren_ are likewise much ramified.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the Urodela have four clefts. In the adult _Siren_ these are\r\nreduced to three, the first, namely, that between the hyoid and the first\r\nbranchial arch, being closed up. In _Necturus_, _Proteus_, and\r\n_Typhlomolge_ the clefts are further reduced to two, owing to the closing\r\nup of the first and last, only those between the first, second, and third\r\narches remaining. _Amphiuma_, and usually _Cryptobranchus alleghaniensis_,\r\npossess only one pair of clefts, while in _C. japonicus_ and in the\r\nSalamandridae all the clefts are abolished.\r\n\r\nThe gills of the Urodela are always uncovered, although a short operculum\r\nis formed from the posterior margin of the hyoidean arch; the halves of\r\nthis fold meet below the throat, and persist in various terrestrial and\r\naquatic species as the \"gular fold.\" It reaches its greatest size just\r\nbefore metamorphosis, but scarcely ever produces a proper outer\r\ngill-chamber, and it does not cover the gills owing to their rather\r\npronounced dorsal position. It is perhaps best developed in _Typhlomolge_,\r\nand even there its dorsal portion is continued upon the first of the three\r\nbroad vertical and short-fringed blades which form the gills.\r\n\r\nA description of the gills of the Apoda will be found in the systematic\r\npart.\r\n\r\nIn the Anura the gills are complicated, owing to the development of the\r\nso-called internal gills. First appear, exactly in the same way as in the\r\nUrodela, the external gills, one upon each of the first three branchial\r\narches. In the larva of _Rana esculenta_, 5 mm. in length, a little\r\nprotuberance appears upon the first, {43}and then upon the second arch. In\r\nthe 6 mm. larva the first gill shows four knobs, the second two, the third\r\none knob. They are always delicate and thin, although sometimes pigmented,\r\nlong, and much-ramified structures. The first pair is always the largest;\r\nwell developed and persisting a long time in _Rana temporaria_; smaller in\r\n_R. esculenta_ and _Bufo vulgaris_; very short, scarcely forked, in _B.\r\nviridis_ and _Hyla arborea_. They are relatively largest in _Alytes_, while\r\nstill in the egg. Numerous descriptions of these gills will be found in the\r\nsystematic part.\r\n\r\nGreat changes take place about the time when the fourth or last branchial\r\narch and the pulmonary arteries are developed. This occurs in _R.\r\nesculenta_ when the larva is about 9 mm. long. The sprouting of the gills\r\nextends gradually downwards along the arches upon their ventral halves, and\r\nthese new gill-filaments or loops transform themselves into numerous\r\ndendritic bundles, resting in several thickset rows upon the hinder margin\r\nof the first to the third arch, one row only on the fourth arch, which\r\ncarries no external gill. These \"internal gills\" look like red bolsters or\r\nthick and short-tasselled bunches. Whilst they are developing the dorsal,\r\nolder gills become arrested in their growth and disappear, and at the same\r\ntime a right and left opercular fold grows out from the head and covers\r\nthese new gills, shutting them up in an outer branchial chamber, just like\r\nthat of Teleostei and other Tectobranch fishes. This is the reason why\r\nthese new gills have been called internal, and the mistaken notion has\r\nsprung up that they are comparable with the true internal gills of fishes.\r\nIn reality Amphibia have only external gills. They are always covered by\r\nectoderm, are restricted to the outside of the branchial arches, and are\r\ndeveloped before the formation of the clefts. These gills are in many cases\r\ndirectly continuous with the more dorsally and more superficially placed\r\nearlier external gills; but although nearly every one who has studied their\r\ndevelopment has observed this agreement, the old error still prevails. They\r\nare morphologically as little internal as the true internal gills of\r\nElasmobranch embryos are external gills, because these have become so\r\nelongated that they protrude out of the gill-clefts.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Amphibia possess only external gills throws important\r\nlight upon their phylogeny. Not only do the Apoda, Urodela, and Anura agree\r\nmuch more with each other than {44}would be the case if the Anura possessed\r\nboth internal and external gills, but the Amphibia reveal themselves also\r\nin this point as connected with the Crossopterygii and the Dipnoi, some of\r\nwhich fishes also possess external gills. It is of course quite possible\r\nthat the Amphibia have developed these organs independently, but we\r\nunderstand now that the latter are accessory, and not the primitive\r\nrespiratory organs; they are developed in adaptation to embryonic\r\nconditions and to prolonged larval, occasionally perennibranchiate, aquatic\r\nlife (cf. the chapter on Neoteny, p. 63).\r\n\r\nThere is no valid reason for supposing that the Stegocephali had true\r\ninternal gills. We know their branchial skeleton, and we can discern even\r\ngill-rakers on the arches. Such gill-rakers occur also, although but feebly\r\ndeveloped, in Urodela. The whole branchial framework of the Urodela and\r\nApoda undergoes simple reductions during metamorphosis (see p. 86), but in\r\nthe Anura these arches are in early tadpole life transformed into a most\r\ncomplicated basket-work which acts as a straining apparatus or filter, to\r\nprevent any particle of food or other foreign matter from finding its way\r\ninto the delicate gills, the current of water passing from the mouth\r\nthrough the filter, past the gills and out of the clefts. During\r\nmetamorphosis this whole elaborate apparatus is again transformed, almost\r\nbeyond recognition, into the hyoidean apparatus for the support of the\r\ngenerally very movable and much-specialised tongue. The fact that the hyoid\r\napparatus of the Aglossa, especially that of _Xenopus_, is constructed upon\r\nthe same lines, is a strong indication that these creatures have arrived at\r\ntheir tongueless condition through the loss of this organ, and this is\r\nintelligible in correlation with their absolutely aquatic life.\r\n\r\nThe opercular folds assume great dimensions in all tadpoles. They cover the\r\nwhole gill-region, thereby producing on either side an outer gill-chamber.\r\nThe posterior margins of the folds gradually become continuous with the\r\nrest of the surface of the body. Each gill-chamber opens at first by one\r\nlateral canal, usually called the spiracle. This condition prevails in the\r\ntadpoles of the Aglossa. In the Discoglossidae the two canals gradually\r\nconverge and combine into one median opening on the middle of the belly. In\r\nall the other Anura the right opening becomes closed, or rather its canal\r\npasses over to and joins that of the {45}left side, both opening by one\r\nshort tube laterally on the left side, at a variable distance between the\r\neye and the vent. Hence the elegant terms of Amphi-, Medio-, and\r\nLaevo-gyrinidae (γυρῖνος being the Greek for tadpole).\r\n\r\nThe external gills lead to a further consideration. _Protopterus_ possesses\r\na vestigial external gill on the shoulder-girdle. _Lepidosiren_ has them on\r\nthe gill-arches, resembling piscine internal gills, and _Polypterus_ has a\r\nlarge biserially fringed external gill (in some cases not disappearing\r\nuntil the fish is adult), which starts from the mandibular arch, at the\r\nlevel of the spiracle or first visceral cleft, and overlaps the operculum\r\nexternally. The axis of this peculiar organ is possibly based upon the\r\nhomologues of the spiracular cartilages, which themselves are the\r\nbranchiostegal rays of the dorsal half of the quadrato-mandibular arch. The\r\nbranchiostegal rays of the hyoidean arch, at least their material, have\r\ngiven rise to the elaborate opercular apparatus; and, in conformity\r\nherewith, the hyomandibular itself is not known to carry a gill. Quite\r\npossibly the large external gill of _Polypterus_ is not serially homologous\r\nwith other external gills–it may not be a true gill at all, it has perhaps\r\nquite a different function–but it seems to throw light upon a mysterious\r\npair of organs which are common in larval and young Urodela, in the larval\r\nAglossa and in the Apoda. These are the \"balancers.\"\r\n\r\nIn _Triton taeniatus_, before hatching, there appears a little protuberance\r\nbehind and below the eye; it rests upon the angle of the mandibular arch,\r\nand is separated from the first transverse, externally visible ridge of the\r\nfirst branchial arch by the beginnings of the hyoidean arch. A few days\r\nlater the arteria hyomandibularis sends a vessel into this knob, forms a\r\nvascular coil, and leaves it as a vein which, instead of returning into the\r\narterial arch, passes into the veins of the body. Its epithelium is not\r\ncovered with flat, but with cubical cells; and sensory cells have not been\r\nfound in it. These organs attain some size, and are shaped like rods, with\r\nthickened ends; they are movable, and are used by the larvae as\r\n\"balancers,\" keeping the head from sinking into the slime at the bottom.\r\nBut they may have other functions besides, and it is not unlikely that they\r\ndevelop into sensory organs like feelers. They occur in many Salamandridae,\r\nand are not reduced until, or even after, the metamorphosis, and during\r\nthis time they shift their place with relation to the eye and the mouth.\r\n\r\n{46}The same kind of organs occur in _Amblystoma_.[18] They appear,\r\nprevious to the breaking open of the gill-clefts, as protrusions of\r\nepiblast, long before any of the external gills on the branchial arches.\r\nWhen the clefts have broken open, the quadrate sends out laterally a tiny\r\ncrescent-shaped process a little above the jaw-joint, and this process\r\nextends to the base of the balancer, but not into it, and a bundle of\r\nmuscle-cells grows into the balancer. It is easy to recognise the same\r\norgan in the extremely long thread-like structures of the larva of\r\n_Xenopus_. In the Apoda they are likewise present, but are retained\r\npermanently as highly specialised, probably tentacular organs (cf. p. 86,\r\nApoda).\r\n\r\nOne of the most unexpected features is the SUPPRESSION OF THE LUNGS in\r\nvarious kinds of Salamandridae. The lungs are either reduced to useless\r\nvestiges or they are quite absent. This occurs in aquatic and terrestrial,\r\nAmerican and European forms, and it is noteworthy that the reduction of the\r\nlungs does not apply to all the species of the various genera, nor is it\r\nrestricted to one sub-family.\r\n\r\nThe following list is due to the researches of H. H. Wilder,[19] L.\r\nCamerano,[20] E. Lönnberg,[21] and G. S. Hopkins[22]:–All the\r\nDesmognathinae and Plethodontinae; Amblystomatinae, _Amblystoma opacum_;\r\nSalamandrinae, _Salamandrina perspicillata_. In _Triton_ and other\r\nSalamandrinae the length of the lungs varies; in some they extend more, in\r\nothers less, than half way down the distance between head and pelvis.\r\nHopkins remarks: \"Two questions are naturally suggested by this apparently\r\naberrant condition of the respiratory organs. First, what structures or\r\norgans have taken on the function of the lungs and branchiae; and secondly,\r\nis there any modification in the form or structure of the heart which in\r\nany way may be correlated with the above-mentioned peculiarities of the\r\nlungless forms?\" Wilder concluded that respiration was probably carried on\r\nby the skin, and perhaps, to some extent, by the mucosa of the intestine.\r\nCamerano thinks that, at least in the European forms, respiration is\r\neffected by the bucco-pharyngeal cavity, and that the skin affords no\r\nefficient aid. The left auricle in the lungless forms is much {47}smaller\r\nin comparison than the right, and there is no pulmonary vein. The auricular\r\nseptum has a large aperture, the communication between the auricles being\r\nlarger than even in _Necturus_ (which breathes essentially by gills). The\r\nsinus venosus, instead of opening into the right auricle only, opens more\r\nfreely into the left than into the right, and the latter communicates more\r\ndirectly with the ventricle than the left, instead of about equally. In\r\nshort, the heart of these creatures appears almost bilocular, instead of\r\nbeing trilocular, at least functionally.\r\n\r\nThe lungs of the Urodela are always simple, extremely thin-walled bags.\r\nThey are highly developed in the Anura, the walls being modified into\r\nnumerous air-cells, whereby the respiratory surface is considerably\r\nincreased. The lungs are filled with air by the pumping motion of the\r\nthroat while the mouth is closed, the nostrils being provided with muscular\r\nvalves. A muscular apparatus assists the filling of the lungs in the\r\nAnura.[23]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.–Internal view of the mouth of A, _Rana esculenta_,\r\nB, _Bufo calamita_ (cf. Fig. 52, p. 269). _Ch_, Choana, or inner nasal\r\nopening; _E_, opening of the Eustachian tube; _S_, slit leading into the\r\nvocal sac; _T_, tongue; _Vo_, patches of teeth on the vomers.]\r\n\r\nMost, if not all, Anura and some Urodela have a VOICE produced by the\r\nlarynx, which, especially in the Anura, is provided with a complicated\r\ncartilaginous and muscular apparatus and with vocal cords. The voice of the\r\nUrodela is at the best a feeble squeak. The females of the Anura are either\r\nmute or they produce a mere grunt, but that of many males is very loud,\r\nand, moreover, in many species it is intensified by _vocal sacs_ which act\r\nas resonators. These sacs are diverticula of the lining of the\r\nmouth-cavity, and bulge out the outer skin and the muscles, chiefly the\r\nmylo-hyoid, of the throat. The nostrils and the mouth are firmly closed\r\nduring the croaking. \"The sacs are called internal when they are covered by\r\nthe unmodified gular integument, however much this may be distended;\r\nexternal when their membrane projects through slits at {48}the sides of the\r\nthroat, as in _Rana esculenta_ (Fig. 52, p. 269), or when the skin is\r\nthinned and converted into a bladder-like pouch, as in _Hyla arborea_.\"[24]\r\nThese sacs exhibit many modifications. They may be unpaired and median, and\r\nopen by two slits into the mouth, on either side below the tongue; in\r\n_Bufo_ one of the slits or openings, either the right or the left, is\r\nobliterated. They may be paired and symmetrical, and open one on each side\r\nof the head, below and near the posterior angle of the jaws. These\r\nmodifications differ in closely allied species. They reach their greatest\r\ncomplication in _Rhinoderma_ and in some of the Cystignathidae by extending\r\nfar back beneath the skin into the wide lymphatic spaces. In _Rhinoderma_\r\nthey are put to the unique use of nurseries for the young (see p. 228).\r\n_Leptodactylus typhonius_ has a very distinct pair of outer vocal sacs and\r\na well-marked unpaired sac which extends into the belly and communicates\r\nwith each outer sac. Several species of _Paludicola_, e.g. _P.\r\nfuscomaculata_ and _P. signifera_, have a similar arrangement, in addition\r\nto an unpaired gular sac which can be inflated independently of the rest\r\n(see Fig. 45, p. 220).\r\n\r\n\r\nURINO-GENITAL ORGANS\r\n\r\nThe kidneys and the male generative glands are still intimately connected\r\nwith each other. The general plan is as follows:–\r\n\r\nThe kidneys consist of a large number of glomeruli, produced by the coiled\r\nsegmental tubes, each of which is composed of a nephrostome or funnel\r\nopening into the body-cavity, a Malpighian body and an efferent canal. The\r\nlatter combine to form the segmental duct which opens into the cloaca. The\r\ntestes, composed of a large number of sperm-producing glands, are drained\r\nby transverse canals which combine into a longitudinal canal, and this\r\nagain sends off numerous efferent canals which open into the efferent\r\ncanals of the kidney, so that the segmental duct (Leydig's duct of many\r\nauthors) conveys both sperma and urine.\r\n\r\n{49}[Illustration: FIG. 7.–Diagrammatic representation of modifications of\r\nthe urino-genital ducts. 1, 2, Male and female Newt; 3, a tubule of the\r\nkidney; 4, male _Rana_; 5, male _Bufo_; 6, male _Bombinator_; 7, male\r\n_Discoglossus_; 8, male _Alytes_. _a_, Artery entering, and producing a\r\ncoil in, the Malpighian body, _M_; _B_, Bidder's organ; _ef.s.c_, efferent\r\nsegmental canal; _F.B_, fat-body; _gl_, glomerulus; _K_, kidney; _l.c.c_,\r\nlongitudinal collecting canal; _M_, Malpighian body; _Md_, Müllerian duct;\r\n_N_, nephrostome; _O_, ovary; _Ov_, oviduct; _s.d_, segmental duct; _T_,\r\ntestis; _Ur_, ureter; _V.d_, vas deferens; _V.s_, vesicula seminalis.]\r\n\r\n{50}In the female the network of transverse and longitudinal canals, which\r\noriginally connect the generative glands with the kidney's efferent canals,\r\nis deduced in so far as the connection is interrupted and the vestiges of\r\nthe transverse canals are no longer functional. The eggs fall into the\r\nbody-cavity and are caught up by the ostium or inner abdominal opening of a\r\nspecial duct, the oviduct (Müllerian duct of many authors). Vestiges, more\r\nor less complete, of these oviducts persist in the males of most Amphibia.\r\n\r\nThis general scheme presents some modifications in the various groups of\r\nAmphibia.\r\n\r\nThe Apoda retain the most primitive conditions. The kidneys are still long\r\nand narrow, and the glomeruli are, at least in the anterior part of the\r\norgan, still strictly segmental, agreeing in number and position, each with\r\na vertebral segment; later, the number of the glomeruli is greatly\r\nincreased, and the former agreement becomes quite disturbed. The generative\r\nglands still retain their segmental arrangement, but they are restricted to\r\na much shorter region than the kidneys. In the male Apoda a considerable\r\nportion of the cloaca can be everted by special muscles, and acts as an\r\nintromittent organ. Both sexes possess a ventral urinary bladder.\r\n\r\nIn the Urodela both kidneys and testes are much concentrated, the testes\r\nespecially have lost all outward appearance of segmentation, and their\r\nefferent canals, connecting them with the longitudinal collecting canal,\r\nare much reduced in numbers. The greater portion of the kidneys, at least\r\ntheir anterior half, has all the appearance of a degenerating organ and is\r\non the way to losing its urinary function, although it still possesses\r\nMalpighian bodies and complete ducts; the main function of the latter is\r\nnow the conveyance of the sperma. In the Perennibranchiata, and in some\r\nothers, e.g. _Spelerpes variegatus_, the longitudinal collecting canal,\r\nbetween testis and kidney, is sometimes suppressed, a very simple, but\r\npseudo-primitive arrangement. A urinary bladder is present. The cloaca is\r\nnot eversible.\r\n\r\nIn most Anura, e.g. _Rana_ and _Bufo_ (Fig. 7; 4, 5), the same scheme is\r\nadhered to. The efferent canals of the testis form a network, with a\r\nlongitudinal canal, and open into the efferent canals of the kidney, in the\r\nsubstance of which they are more or less deeply imbedded. The ducts which\r\nlead out of the kidney to compose Leydig's duct, are frequently dilated, or\r\nthe latter duct is much elongated, convoluted or varicated, and this whole\r\nportion is enclosed in a sheath of connective tissue, giving an\r\n{51}appearance as if the single duct itself were dilated in the greater\r\npart of its length; hence the occasional name of vesicula seminalis. Such\r\nmeans of storing the sperma enable the latter to be ejected suddenly in\r\ngreat quantities.\r\n\r\nIn _Bombinator_ (6) some of the most anterior seminal canals do not\r\nperforate the kidney, but run over it superficially and open directly into\r\na branch of Leydig's duct. This branch, no doubt equivalent to a number of\r\nsegmental canals which have lost their uriniferous function, is curved\r\nround the upper end of the permanent kidney, while its forward\r\ncontinuation, ending blindly, is the remnant of its former headward\r\nextension. This arrangement of _Bombinator_ is carried further in\r\n_Discoglossus_ (7). The testis conveys its sperma through a wide duct\r\ndirectly into Leydig's canal, without interfering with the kidney, and all\r\nthe testicular efferent network is lost. The anterior end of Leydig's duct\r\nstill extends headwards; its middle portion acts solely as a vas deferens,\r\nwhile the lower portion still behaves like a typical segmental duct,\r\nconveying both sperma and urine. Lastly, in _Alytes_ (8) the functional\r\ndivision of the old segmental duct has been carried to an extreme. The\r\nkidney is drained by one canal only, now a true ureter, and this is of\r\ncourse produced by a consolidation of the multiple exclusively uriniferous\r\ncanals of the lower half of the kidney. The whole of the segmental duct is\r\nnow in the service of the testis, and near its junction with the ureter it\r\nforms a large diverticulum or true vesicula seminalis.\r\n\r\nRemnants of oviducts, or Müllerian ducts, are common in the male Anura;\r\nthey are best developed in _Bufo_, much reduced, and individually absent,\r\nin _Rana_. In _Bombinator_ each duct is restricted to its upper or\r\nabdominal portion, and is attached to the vestigial headward extension of\r\nLeydig's duct. Lastly in _Discoglossus_ and in _Alytes_ all traces of\r\noviducts seem to have vanished, at least in the adult males.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in the arrangement of the urino-genital\r\nducts the Discoglossidae are the most advanced of all Amphibia, instead of\r\nshowing the most primitive conditions. This is rather unexpected, but is\r\nparalleled by the epichordal type of the vertebral column.\r\n\r\nThe oviducts of the Apoda and Urodela remain more or less straight; in the\r\nviviparous species they form uterus-like dilatations. In the Anura they\r\nbecome greatly elongated during the {52}breeding season and form many\r\nconvolutions. As a rule each oviduct opens separately into the cloaca, but\r\nin _Hyla_ they have one unpaired opening, while in _Bufo_ and _Alytes_ the\r\nlower parts of both oviducts are themselves confluent.\r\n\r\nAll Amphibia possess FAT-BODIES. They consist of richly vascularised\r\nlymphatic tissue, the meshes of which are filled with lymph-cells, globules\r\nof fat and oil. In the Apoda these bodies lie laterally to the generative\r\nglands, and along the posterior half of the kidneys. In the Urodela they\r\naccompany the anterior half of the kidney. In the Anura they are lobate,\r\nand are placed upon the anterior end of the testes or ovaries. Their exact\r\nfunction is still doubtful, but it is intimately connected with that of the\r\ngenerative glands. The old notion, that they are simply stores of fat for\r\nthe nourishment of the animal during hibernation, is quite untenable. The\r\nfat-bodies do not decrease during this period, on the contrary they attain\r\ntheir fullest size in the spring at the time of the rapidly awaking\r\nactivity of the reproductive organs, and they enable considerable\r\nquantities of sperma and of eggs to be produced and ripened without\r\ndetriment to, or utter exhaustion of, the animals, which often spawn before\r\nthey have had time or opportunity to feed. After the spawning season the\r\nfat-bodies have dwindled down to inconspicuous dimensions.\r\n\r\nLastly, there is in some Anura, hitherto observed in _Bufo_ only, a\r\nmysterious organ, intercalated between the fat-body and the testis or\r\novary. This is \"Bidder's organ\" and it seems to be a rudimentary ovary, or\r\nrather that upper, anterior portion of the whole organ which undergoes\r\nretrogressive metamorphosis. It disappears in old female toads, but in the\r\nmales it sometimes assumes a size equal to, or surpassing that of the\r\ntestes. The males are in this respect hermaphrodite, and cases are known in\r\nwhich parts of the generative glands have developed testes and egg-bearing\r\novaries.\r\n\r\nThe SPERMATOZOA of the Apoda and Urodela have an undulating membrane along\r\nthe tail, while the head-end is either pointed or truncated. Those of\r\n_Spelerpes fuscus_ and of _Ichthyophis glutinosa_ measure about 0.7 mm. in\r\ntotal length, those of the other Urodela being much smaller. A peculiarity\r\nof the Urodela is that their spermatozoa are massed together in or upon\r\nspermatophores, an arrangement which undoubtedly facilitates the internal\r\n{53}fecundation of the female without actual copulation. The female takes\r\nup such a deposited spermatophore with the cloacal lips, squeezes the\r\nsperma out of the capsule which remains behind, and either conveys the\r\nformer into a special receptaculum seminis, _e.g._ in _Salamandra atra_ and\r\nin _Triton_, or the spermatozoa wriggle their way, thanks to the undulating\r\ntail, directly up the oviducts to the ova.\r\n\r\nThe spermatophores are composed of a colourless, soft, gelatinous mass,\r\nwhich is probably produced by the cloacal gland. The shell of jelly is in\r\nfact a cast of the cloacal cavity, reproducing all its ridges, furrows and\r\nfolds, while a toad-stool-shaped papilla of the cloaca makes the inside\r\nlumen of the cast, _e.g._ in _Triton_. Those of _Salamandra maculosa_ are\r\nmuch simpler, consisting, in conformity with the absence of a cloacal\r\npapilla, merely of a cone with a globular mass of sperma on the top. Those\r\nof _Amblystoma_ are similar.\r\n\r\nThe spermatozoa of the Anura show considerable differences in the various\r\ngenera, of which, however, only the European forms have been properly\r\nexamined. The \"head\" is wound like a corkscrew in _Discoglossus_,\r\n_Pelobates_, and _Pelodytes_; spindle-shaped, more or less curved, in _Rana\r\ntemporaria_ and _R. agilis_, _Hyla_, _Bufo_ and _Bombinator_, in the latter\r\nwith an irregular membrane on one side; cylindrical in _Rana esculenta_ and\r\n_R. arvalis_. The tail is mostly long and filiform, but in _Bufo vulgaris_\r\nand _Discoglossus_ it is provided with an undulating membrane. Their size\r\nis generally very small, only about 0.1 mm., excepting those of\r\n_Discoglossus_ which reach the astonishing length of 3 mm. These\r\ndifferences in shape, especially that of the head, explain why species of\r\nthe same genus, e.g. _Rana temporaria_ and _R. arvalis_, cannot fertilise\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.–A bell-shaped spermatophore of _Triton alpestris_. ×\r\n3. (After Zeller.)[25]]\r\n\r\nThe EGGS differ much in size, colour, and numbers. They are holoblastic,\r\nwith unequal cleavage, but those species which possess an unusual amount of\r\nfood-yolk, for instance _Rhacophorus schlegeli_ and the Apoda, approach the\r\nmeroblastic type of segmentation. As a rule, the greater the amount of\r\nyolk, the smaller is the number of eggs produced. But the number which is\r\nlaid {54}during one season is not only difficult to calculate, but it\r\nvaries individually, old females laying more than young specimens.\r\nMoreover, some kinds, _e.g._ the Discoglossidae, spawn several times in one\r\nyear. _Alytes_, _Rhinoderma_, _Hylodes_, _Rhacophorus_, _Pipa_, in fact\r\nthose kinds which are remarkable for special nursing habits, lay only a few\r\ndozen eggs at a time. _Hyla arborea_ produces up to 1000, _Rana temporaria_\r\nabout 3000, _Bufo vulgaris_ averages 5000, _Bufo viridis_ and _Rana\r\nesculenta_ up to 10,000 and more. T. H. Morgan[26] has observed a _Bufo\r\nlentiginosus_ which laid 28,000 eggs within ten hours! The number of eggs\r\nproduced by the Apoda and Urodela is comparatively moderate, in the average\r\na few dozen, _Amblystoma_ alone laying about 1000.\r\n\r\nThe eggs possess a gelatinous mantle of variable thickness and consistency.\r\nIn _Amphiuma_ they are strung together like the beads of a rosary, and the\r\nenvelope hardens into a kind of shell. Many Newts and some Anura fasten\r\ntheir eggs singly on to plants and other objects in the water, with or\r\nwithout threads of stiffening mucus. In many Anura, _e.g._ Bufonidae, they\r\npass out as closely-set strings of beads, one string out of each oviduct;\r\nin others, _e.g._ Ranidae, they are disconnected, and form large, lumpy\r\nmasses, especially when the gelatinous mantle swells up in the water. The\r\nuse of this mantle seems to be chiefly the protection of the growing\r\nembryo, which in many species, when hatched out of the egg proper, drops\r\ninto and remains for some time in the softened jelly. Possibly the latter\r\naffords some nutriment to the early larva.\r\n\r\nConcerning the mode of FECUNDATION it is to be remarked that copulation\r\nproper takes place only in the Apoda. For the Urodela Boulenger[27] has\r\ngiven the following summary. In no case does actual copulation take place.\r\nThe male deposits the spermatophores which it is the office of the female\r\nto secure:–\r\n\r\n   I. No amplexus, but a lengthy courtship in the water; the male is more\r\n  brilliantly coloured than the female, and ornamented with dorsal and\r\n  caudal crests, or other appendages: _Triton_, cf. also systematic part.\r\n\r\n  II. Amplexus takes place; there are no marked sexual differences in\r\n  colour and no ornamental dermal appendages.\r\n\r\n    A. Amplexus of short duration, partly on land, but deposition of the\r\n    sperma in the water. No accessory sexual characters: Terrestrial\r\n    Salamanders, namely _Salamandra_, _Chioglossa_, _Salamandrina_.\r\n    _Spelerpes_ breeds in damp caves without water.\r\n\r\n    {55}B. Amplexus of lengthy duration and in the water.\r\n\r\n      _a._ The male, distinguished by a greater development of the\r\n      fore-limbs, which are armed with temporary excrescences, clasps the\r\n      female in the axillary region with the fore-limbs: _Triton waltli_.\r\n\r\n      _b._ The male, distinguished by a greater development of the\r\n      hind-limbs and a prehensile tail, clasps the female in the lumbar and\r\n      caudal regions: The _Euproctus_-group of newts: _Triton asper_, _T.\r\n      rusconii_, and _T. montanus_.\r\n\r\nThe act of fecundation of most of the other kinds of Urodela, notably\r\n_Cryptobranchus_, _Amphiuma_, _Proteus_, has not yet been observed.\r\n\r\nEmbracing of the two sexes is the universal rule with the Anura, the male\r\ncreeping on to the back of the female and clasping her firmly with the arms\r\nand hands either in the inguinal region, higher up, or under the armpits.\r\nSee the numerous statements in the systematic part. This often extremely\r\nforcible, pressing embrace seems to be necessary, although the females can\r\ndeposit the eggs without the help of the male, but in such cases the\r\nexpulsion takes place at irregular intervals instead of at one time. When\r\nthe eggs appear at last, and this happens in many species many hours, or\r\neven some days, after the beginning of the embrace, the male voids the\r\ncontents of its seminal vesicles over them. Fertilisation is consequently\r\nexternal, with the possible exception of _Pipa_, _q.v._ p. 152.\r\n\r\nDEPOSITION OF THE EGGS AND NURSING HABITS.–The majority of the Amphibia are\r\noviparous, but some Apoda and Urodela are viviparous. It is unnecessary to\r\ncall the latter condition ovo-viviparous, since this is really a\r\ndistinction without a difference.\r\n\r\nViviparous forms:–amongst Urodela; _Salamandra maculosa_, the young burst\r\nthe egg-membrane in the act of being born, and are provided with long\r\ngills; _S. atra_, the young undergo their whole development and\r\nmetamorphosis within the uterus (see p. 119); _Spelerpes fuscus_, the young\r\nare likewise born in the perfect condition: amongst Apoda; _Typhlonectes\r\ncompressicauda_ and _Dermophis thomensis_.\r\n\r\nThe oviparous Apoda, at least _Ichthyophis_ and _Hypogeophis_, and a few of\r\nthe Urodela, as _Desmognathus_ and _Amphiuma_, take care of their eggs by\r\ncoiling themselves around them in a hole underground.\r\n\r\nNursing habits are very common amongst the Anura. {56}Boulenger[28] has\r\nsummarised the various conditions concerning the deposition and care that\r\nis taken of the eggs, in the following list, in which more recent\r\ndiscoveries have been interpolated.\r\n\r\n  I. The ovum is small, and the larva leaves it in a comparatively early\r\n  embryonic condition.\r\n\r\n    A. The eggs are laid in the water:–\r\n\r\n      _a._ Without further care or preparations: probably the majority of\r\n      Anura; all European forms, except _Alytes_.\r\n\r\n      _b._ The eggs are laid in a specially walled-in part of the pond:\r\n      _Hyla faber_.\r\n\r\n    B. The eggs are deposited out of the water:–\r\n\r\n      _a._ In holes, or under grass, near the banks of pools. The larvae\r\n      are liberated and washed into the water by the next heavy rain:\r\n      _Leptodactylus ocellatus_, _L. mystacinus_, _Paludicola gracilis_,\r\n      _Pseudophryne australis_ and _P. bibroni_.\r\n\r\n      _b._ On leaves above the water, the larvae dropping down when leaving\r\n      the egg: _Chiromantis rufescens_, _Phyllomedusa iheringi_, _Ph.\r\n      hypochondrialis_.\r\n\r\n  II. The yolk is very large and the young undergoes the whole or part of\r\n  the metamorphosis within the egg; at any rate the larva does not assume\r\n  an independent existence until after the loss of the gills.\r\n\r\n    A. The eggs are deposited in damp situations, or on leaves. The young\r\n    escape as:–\r\n\r\n      _a._ Tadpoles: _Arthroleptis seychellensis_, _Rhacophorus schlegeli_,\r\n      _Rh. maculatus_.\r\n\r\n      _b._ Perfect, air-breathing frogs: _Rana opisthodon_, _Hylodes\r\n      martinicensis_, _Hyla nebulosa_.\r\n\r\n    B. The eggs are carried by a parent.\r\n\r\n      _a._ By the male:–\r\n\r\n        α. Round the legs; the young leaves the egg in the tadpole stage:\r\n        _Alytes_.\r\n\r\n        β. In the enlarged vocal sacs; the young leave in the perfect\r\n        state: _Rhinoderma_.\r\n\r\n      _b._ By the female:–\r\n\r\n        α. Attached to the belly: _Rhacophorus reticulatus_.\r\n\r\n        β. Attached to the back; the young complete their metamorphosis\r\n        within the egg: _Pipa_.\r\n\r\n        γ. In a dorsal pouch which the young leave as tadpoles: _Nototrema\r\n        marsupiatum_;–or in the perfect state: _Nototrema testudineum_, _N.\r\n        cornutum_, _N. oviferum_, _N. fissipes_, and _Hyla goeldii_.\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT AND METAMORPHOSIS of many species have been described in\r\nthe systematic part. The following is a short general account of some of\r\nthe more important features. Metamorphosis in the Apoda and Urodela is\r\nrestricted chiefly to the reduction of the gills, the closing of the\r\nclefts, and the loss of the {57}gill-chamber and the finny margins of the\r\ntail; but the change from the tadpole to the final Anurous animal implies\r\nan almost entire reorganisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.–Four stages of the development of the adhesive\r\napparatus (_A_) of _Bufo vulgaris_; _M_, Mouth; _Sp.T._ spiracular tube. In\r\n3 the gills are almost completely hidden by the united right and left\r\nopercular folds. The small outlined figures indicate the shape and natural\r\nsize of the tadpoles. (After Thiele.)]\r\n\r\nIn the earliest condition the embryo consists of a large head and body,\r\nwhile the tail is still absent. Behind the beginnings of the future mouth\r\nappears a transverse crescentic fold, with the convexity looking backwards,\r\nwhich develops into the paired or unpaired _adhesive apparatus_. This\r\nconsists of large complex glands, developed in the Malpighian layer,\r\noriginally covered by the cuticula, which soon disappears, whereupon the\r\nsticky secretion enables the larva to attach itself to the gelatinous\r\nmantle of the egg, later on to weeds or other objects in the water. The\r\nname of suckers, often applied to this apparatus, conveys a wrong idea,\r\nthere being neither muscles nor any suctorial function. The shape of this\r\norgan undergoes many changes during the early life of the individual, and\r\ndiffers much in the various genera, affording thereby diagnostic\r\ncharacters.[29] At first a crescent, it divides into a right and a left\r\noval or disc, which either remain asunder and behind the mouth (_Rana_,\r\n_Bufo_), or they move forwards to the corners of the mouth (_Hyla_) or\r\nfurther back, and unite again more or less completely, as in _Discoglossus_\r\nand _Bombinator_. It is mostly of short duration, and disappears by the\r\ntime that the larva, by the proper development of the gills and the tail\r\nand the functional mouth, changes into the tadpole. But in a few species\r\nthese discs transform themselves into an elaborate ventral disc. Such an\r\norgan persists throughout the greater part of the tadpole-stage in certain\r\nOriental species of _Rana_, all of which, when adult, possess fully webbed\r\ntoes and {58}strongly dilated discs on the fingers and toes, e.g. _Rana\r\nwhiteheadi_, _R. natatrix_, and _R. cavitympanum_ of Borneo, _R. jerboa_ of\r\nJava (this larva was originally described and figured as that of\r\n_Rhacophorus reinwardti_), and _R. afghana_ of the Himalayan system. These\r\ntadpoles, at least those of _R. jerboa_, are further remarkable for having\r\nthe \"spiracular\" opening very far back on the left side, nearer to the base\r\nof the tail than to the snout, so as to be well out of the way when the\r\ncreature has attached itself by the adhesive disc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.–1, Front view of the mouth of a tadpole of _Rana\r\ntemporaria_, showing the transverse rows of tiny horny teeth; 2, three\r\nsuccessive horny teeth, much magnified. (After Gutzeit.)]\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the tadpoles of Anura is furnished with horny armaments,\r\nsubstitutes for teeth. Their development and that of the mouth in general\r\nhas been well described by Gutzeit.[30] In the young larvae of _Rana\r\ntemporaria_, one or two days after hatching, a shallow groove appears above\r\nthe conspicuous pair of adhesive organs. The groove becomes rhombic in\r\noutline, and when the mouth has been formed in its centre, the jaws appear\r\nin the median corners of the rhombus. The epidermis then rises like a\r\ncircular wall around the jaws, and divides into an upper and lower lip;\r\nfurrows appear on them, and between these various papillae and comb-like\r\ntransverse plates of teeth. The papillae are possibly tactile organs, but\r\nalthough nerves enter them, nerve-endings of a sensory nature have not yet\r\nbeen discovered. On the fourth day the jaws become black, by the tenth day\r\nhorny teeth have appeared upon all the plates of the mouth-armature, and on\r\nthe seventeenth day the mouth-apparatus has reached the configuration\r\ntypical of the tadpole, which is now about 14 mm. long. The number of horny\r\nteeth in _R. temporaria_ amounts to about 640. These teeth are not\r\ncuticular products, but cornified cells; they are very small, and consist\r\neach of one horny cell, which is shaped like a nightcap, the apex of which\r\nis curved back and serrated. The little teeth are shed continuously,\r\n{59}the renewal taking place by successive cells growing into the bases of\r\nthe older series. The shape and size differ much in the various genera and\r\nspecies. The comb-like plates, composed of those teeth which surround the\r\nlips, seem to be used chiefly for the fixing or hooking of the food, while\r\nthose which compose the horny beak proper, the armature of the jaws, are\r\nused like the radulae of snails. These beaks are likewise composed of a\r\ngreat number of individual teeth, closely packed together in several rows,\r\nbut the teeth themselves are simple and not serrated.\r\n\r\nIn _Hyla arborea_ there are in all about 560 teeth. The development of the\r\nmouth does not begin before the eleventh day; the horny teeth break\r\nthrough, and the jaws get black edges, on the eighteenth. In _Pelobates\r\nfuscus_ the number of horny teeth is increased to about 1100. In\r\n_Borborocoetes taeniatus_ the horny teeth form series of five bells, which\r\nfit into each other like the joints of a rattlesnake's tail.\r\n\r\nOne of the most extraordinary kinds of tadpoles is that of _Megalophrys\r\nmontana_.[31] Mr. Annandale (Skeat Expedition) found it at Bukit Besar,\r\nMalay Peninsula, from 2000 to 3000 feet above the level of the sea. The\r\ntadpoles (Fig. 11) were found in the beginning of the month of May 1899 in\r\nsandy streams and in pools of rain-water; they floated in a vertical\r\nposition, the peculiar membranous funnel-shaped expansion of the lips\r\nacting as surface-floats. The inside of the funnel is beset with radiating\r\nseries of little horny teeth, and the whole apparatus is possibly used for\r\nscraping the under-surface of the leaves of water-plants in search of food.\r\nTotal length of the tadpoles 1 inch.[32]\r\n\r\nThe gills, the formation of the operculum, and the modifications of the\r\nbranchial arterial arches have been described fully on p. 43; those of the\r\nhyo-branchial skeleton on p. 31. Fusion of the opercular fold with the skin\r\nof the neck, across the branchial region, causes the head to become\r\nconfluent with the trunk (cf. Fig. 9, 3, p. 57). The body becomes oval,\r\nmore or less globular, and the alimentary canal is greatly elongated and\r\nstowed away in the shape of a neat, very regular spiral, shining through\r\n{60}the ventral wall of the body; the anus opens at the end of a somewhat\r\nprotruding tube, either in the median line, just in front of the ventral\r\nfin (Discoglossidae, _Pelobates_, _Bufo_), or it assumes an asymmetrical\r\nposition by turning to the right side (_Hyla_, _Rana_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.–Tadpoles of _Megalophrys montana_ from Bukit Besar,\r\nMalay Peninsula. × 3.]\r\n\r\nAlthough both pairs of limbs begin to bud simultaneously, or the fore-limbs\r\neven earlier, the hind-limbs are hurried on, and appear first, long before\r\nthe fore-limbs. The latter lie ready beneath the skin of the gill-chamber,\r\nand the right always breaks through the skin, while the left does the same\r\nin the Mediogyrinidae, while in the Laevogyrinidae it is generally pushed\r\nthrough the left-sided spiracular opening, immediately behind the outer\r\ngills. According to Barfurth the right limb appears, in about 80 per cent.\r\nof _Rana esculenta_, from two to eight hours before the left.\r\n\r\n{61}Meanwhile the lungs are being developed, and the tadpole occasionally\r\nrises to the surface to breathe air. The gills, which, as has been\r\nexplained elsewhere, are less ancestral than they are larval organs,\r\ndegenerate, and all the organs are modified for the coming terrestrial\r\nlife. The fins of the tail are absorbed, the horny armature of the mouth\r\nand lips is shed in pieces and makes room for the true teeth, the eyes\r\nreceive lids, and the whole cranium, especially the apparatus of the jaws,\r\nundergoes the final modifications–widening and lengthening of the mouth,\r\narresting of the mento-Meckelian cartilages, elongation of the Meckelian\r\ncartilages or lower jaw proper, shifting backwards of the suspensorium, and\r\nlengthening of its orbital process to form the pterygo-palatine bridge.\r\n\r\nThe tadpole ceases to feed, the whole intestinal canal is voided of its\r\ncontents, and by \"histolysis\" is thoroughly rebuilt, becoming wider and\r\nshrinking to about one-sixth of its original length,–undoing thereby the\r\nspiral–preparatory for the coarser food, which consists of insects, worms,\r\nand other strictly animal, living matter. Hitherto the tadpoles have lived\r\non \"mud,\" confervae, Diatoms, rotting vegetable and animal matter. The anal\r\ntube collapses, becomes ultimately absorbed, and a new vent is formed at\r\nand below the root of the tail.\r\n\r\nBarfurth[33] has made interesting observations and experiments with regard\r\nto the absorption of the tail and other organs which disappear during the\r\nmetamorphosis. This is retarded by low temperature; it is accelerated by\r\nrest and freedom from mechanical disturbances, as, for instance, concussion\r\nof the water. Hunger shortens or hurries on the last stages of\r\nmetamorphosis, the absorption of the tail taking place in four instead of\r\nfive days. Amputation of the tail has no retarding influence; it is\r\nfollowed at once by regeneration, although the tadpole may be on the verge\r\nof reducing the tail. Whilst hungering the whole organism draws upon its\r\navailable store of material, naturally first upon those parts which sooner\r\nor later are to become superfluous. This applies eminently to the tail,\r\nwhich represents a considerable amount of \"edible\" matter, and also to that\r\nportion of the skin which still covers the fore-limbs. The elements of the\r\ncutis are resorbed, thereby thinning the skin; and consequently the limbs\r\nbreak through earlier in fasting than in well-fed {62}specimens. Nature\r\nherself seems to apply hunger as an accelerator. Mlle. von Chauvin found\r\nthat the larvae of Urodela normally fast during the transformation, and\r\naccording to Barfurth the larvae of _Rana temporaria_ eat less after their\r\nhind-limbs are fully developed. This is, however, also preparatory for the\r\nreorganisation of the gut, which has to be more or less empty during the\r\nshortening process.\r\n\r\nThe loss of the tail is not due to a sudden dropping off of this organ–a\r\ncrude but by no means uncommon belief–but is brought about by a very\r\ngradual process of resorbtion. When the fore-limbs begin to break through\r\nthe skin, the tip of the tail shrinks and becomes black, owing to an\r\nincrease, or rather concentration, of the pigment cells. The reduction\r\nproceeds from the tip forwards until on about the fifth day there remains\r\nonly a short, conical, black stump. From the beginning of this process of\r\nreduction the tail is scarcely used for locomotion, the tadpole rowing with\r\nits legs, or it crawls and hops about, although the tail may still be 20\r\nmm. long. The cells of the epidermis atrophy, shrink, and peel off, while\r\nthose of the cutis, blood-vessels, nerves, muscles, and chorda dorsalis\r\nbecome disintegrated, often undergoing fatty degeneration. The leucocytes\r\neat up the débris and other dissolved tissue, and carry it away through the\r\nlymphatic vessels, to be used as new building material in the rest of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nBarfurth asks very properly, Why do these tissues degenerate and die?\r\nBecause the vasomotor nerve-fibres cease to regulate the circulation. And\r\nwhy does this trophic influence of the central nervous system stop? Because\r\nthe function of the tail becomes superfluous through the appearance of the\r\nfore-limbs. The tail is doomed, and degenerates like any other organ\r\nwithout a function. The whole process is, of course, a recapitulation of\r\nancestral, phylogenetic evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{63}CHAPTER III\r\n\r\nNEOTENY–REGENERATION–TEMPERATURE–GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nNEOTENY.–It has long been known that the larvae of the Spotted Salamander\r\noccasionally attain the size of 80 mm. or about 3 inches, whilst the\r\nmajority undergo metamorphosis when they are only 40 mm. long. Again,\r\nlarvae of _Triton_ have been found, in the months of April and May, 80 to\r\n90 mm. long, still with functional gills, but with the sexual organs fully\r\ndeveloped. De Filippi[34] found in one locality in Lombardy, besides a few\r\nnormal fully metamorphosed specimens of only 30 mm. in length, more than\r\nforty specimens, which, although they had attained full size, about 55 mm.,\r\nand were sexually mature, still retained their gills. According to him such\r\ngill-breathing, otherwise mature specimens, occur constantly in a small\r\nlake in the Val Formazzo, on the Italian slope of the Alps, in the province\r\nof Ossola. Later Duméril[35] astonished the world by his account of the\r\nmetamorphosis of the Mexican gill-breathing Axolotl into an entirely\r\nlung-breathing and terrestrial creature, hitherto called _Amblystoma_, and\r\nsupposed to be not only a different species, but to belong to a different\r\nfamily from the Axolotl, which was known as _Siredon axolotl_ s.\r\n_pisciforme_, and naturally classed with the Perennibranchiata.\r\n\r\nThis discovery led to a series of observations and experiments, chiefly\r\nconducted by Marie von Chauvin, instigated thereto by Koelliker and by\r\nCamerano.[36] It was then found that many, if not most of the European\r\nAmphibia, both Urodela and Anura, {64}occasionally postpone their\r\nmetamorphosis, and also that such Urodela sometimes become adult for all\r\npractical purposes, but retain their gills.\r\n\r\nThis retardation, the retention of larval characters beyond the normal\r\nperiod, was called _Neotenie_ by Kollmann[37] (νέος, young; τείνω, extend,\r\nstretch). He distinguished further between:–I. Partial Neoteny, namely,\r\nsimple retardation of the metamorphosis beyond the normal period, for\r\ninstance, the wintering of tadpoles of _Pelobates fuscus_, _Bombinator\r\npachypus_, _Pelodytes punctatus_, _Alytes obstetricans_, _Hyla arborea_,\r\n_Rana esculenta_, _R. temporaria_, _Bufo vulgaris_, and _B. viridis_: II.\r\nTotal Neoteny, where the animal retains its gills, but becomes sexually\r\nmature; hitherto observed in Urodela only, e.g. _Triton vulgaris_, _T.\r\nalpestris_, _T. cristatus_, _T. boscai_, _T. waltli_ and _Amblystoma_.\r\nIntermediate stages between these two categories are not uncommon.\r\n\r\nA satisfactory explanation of the meaning of neoteny is beset with\r\ndifficulties. Some authorities look upon the phenomenon simply as the\r\nresult of adaptation to the surroundings, which make it advantageous for\r\nthe creature to retain its larval features. Others think that the\r\nsurroundings somehow or other retard or prevent the assumption of the adult\r\ncharacters. Undoubtedly there are many cases in which larvae have been\r\nreared in water-holes with steep walls, so that they could not change from\r\naquatic to terrestrial life, and it stands to reason that abnormally forced\r\nand prolonged use of the gills and of the tail may stimulate these organs\r\ninto further growth at the expense of the limbs and other organs which are\r\nintended for terrestrial life. But not unfrequently typical neotenic and\r\novergrown specimens occur side by side with others which have completed\r\ntheir metamorphosis, and the same is true of larvae of newts which were\r\nreared, for experimental purposes, under exactly the same conditions–for\r\ninstance, in a high-walled glass vessel.\r\n\r\nWeismann tried to explain neoteny as cases of reversion to atavistic\r\nancestral conditions, but this idea is based upon an assumption which is\r\nprobably wrong. His idea necessitates the supposition that all the Amphibia\r\nwere originally gill-breathing, aquatic, and limbless animals, and that\r\nevery feature seen in a larva must necessarily indicate an ancestral\r\nphylogenetic stage. It is, on the contrary, much more probable that {65}the\r\nexternal gills of the Urodela have been developed in adaptation to their\r\nembryonic and larval, essentially aquatic, life. Consequently the\r\npossession of such gills would be a secondary, and not, strictly speaking,\r\nan atavistic feature. Normal loss of these gills, exclusively pulmonary\r\nrespiration, and preponderating terrestrial life characterise the final\r\nadult Amphibian. These cases of neoteny are therefore instances of more or\r\nless complete retardation, or of the retention, of partially larval\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem is, however, by no means simple. _Salamandra atra_ has\r\nbecome viviparous, and the whole metamorphosis takes place within the\r\nuterus; in fact, the young have an embryonic, but no larval period, if by\r\nthe latter we understand the free swimming and still imperfect stage.\r\nSimilarly, various Anura–for instance, _Hylodes martinicensis_–pass rapidly\r\nthrough their metamorphosis, and have suppressed the stage of free swimming\r\ntadpoles. On the other hand, in many newts, the duration of the larval\r\nperiod is much prolonged, and moreover is very subject to individual\r\nvariation. In the Axolotl this larval period is continued until and after\r\nsexual maturity is reached. The extreme condition would then be represented\r\nby the Perennibranchiate genera. It may seem reasonable to look upon these\r\nas the youngest members of the Urodela, and the loss of the maxillae in the\r\nSirenidae and Proteidae supports this idea. But it so happens that the\r\nmajority of the most neotenic genera are more primitive in the composition\r\nof the skull and the vertebral column than the typically terrestrial and\r\nrapidly metamorphosing genera. Witness the amphicoelous vertebrae, the\r\ncompleteness of the pterygoids, the separate nature of the palatine bones,\r\nand the separate splenials, as mentioned in detail in the description of\r\ntheir skull.\r\n\r\nWe have therefore to conclude, first, that the various Perennibranchiate\r\ngenera do not form a natural group, but are a heterogeneous assembly;\r\nsecondly, that they have become Perennibranchiate at a phylogenetically old\r\nstage–in fact, that they are the oldest, and not the newest, members of the\r\npresent Urodela. At the same time, it would be erroneous to suppose that\r\nthe first Urodela were aquatic creatures, provided with a finny tail, with\r\nsmall, ill-developed lungs, and with epidermal sense organs. All these\r\nfeatures are, on the contrary, directly correlated with aquatic life, and\r\nare larval acquisitions, not ancestral {66}reminiscences. It would be\r\nequally wrong to allude to the absence of lungs in many newts as a piscine\r\nand therefore ancestral feature. The development of the typical\r\npentadactyloid limb, the connexion of the pelvic girdle with the vertebral\r\ncolumn, the development of the lungs, and absolute suppression of internal\r\ngills point without doubt to terrestrial creatures. What then, may we ask,\r\nwere the first Amphibia like? and how about the external gills? They were\r\nundoubtedly akin to the less specialised Lepospondylous Stegocephali, in\r\nparticular the gill-less Microsauri, and the various stages may perhaps be\r\nreconstructed as follows:–\r\n\r\n(1) Terrestrial, with two pairs of pentadactyloid limbs; breathing by lungs\r\nonly; with a fully developed apparatus of five pairs of gill-arches, which\r\nduring the embryonic life perhaps still carried internal gills; with or\r\nwithout several pairs of gill-clefts. Reduction of the dermal armour and of\r\nthe cutaneous scutes had taken place.\r\n\r\n(2) Additional respiratory organs were developed by the embryo, in the\r\nshape of external gills; these were at first restricted to embryonic life\r\n(as in the existing Apoda), but were gradually used also during the aquatic\r\nlife of the larva. These external gills, together with the lungs, have\r\nsuperseded the internal gills, of which there are now no traces either in\r\nUrodela or in Anura.\r\n\r\n(3_a_) Some Urodeles, retaking to aquatic life, retained and further\r\nenlarged the external gills into more or less permanent organs (cf. also\r\n_Siren_, p. 136).\r\n\r\n(3_b_) The majority of Urodela hurried through the larval, aquatic stage,\r\nand some–e.g. _Salamandra atra_–became absolutely terrestrial. The\r\npossession of unusually long external gills by this species and by the\r\nApoda indicate that these organs are essentially embryonic, not larval,\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nREGENERATION.–Most Amphibia possess the faculty of regenerating mutilated\r\nor lost limbs. This takes place the more certainly and quickly the younger\r\nthe animal. The amputation necessary to study these phenomena need not be\r\nexperimental. Axolotls and other Urodelous larvae frequently maim each\r\nother fearfully, by biting off the gills or one or more limbs. The gills do\r\nnot even require amputation. If the larvae are kept in stagnant water the\r\ngills often shrivel up or slough off and grow again. {67}The same applies\r\nto the larvae of viviparous species, e.g. _Salamandra atra_, which, when\r\ncut out of the uterus and put into water, soon cast off their long, tender\r\ngills and produce a stronger set. In an Axolotl,[38] two years old, a hand\r\nwas cut off. After four weeks there was a conical stump; after the sixth\r\nweek this stump had two points; in the eleventh week three or four fingers\r\nwere discernible, and a week later the complete hand. Frequently these\r\ncreatures reproduce five instead of the normal four fingers. But the more\r\nproximal the cut, the more liable is the new limb to reproduce\r\nsupernumerary fingers, or even extra hands and feet. Complete regeneration\r\nof the limb, cut off in the middle of the humerus, took place within five\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_Triton taeniatus_, adult, reproduces cut fingers within five or six weeks,\r\nand if the hand be cut above the carpus, new finger-stumps appear in about\r\none month. Götte has observed that an adult _Proteus_ did not completely\r\nreproduce its whole leg until after eighteen months; and, according to\r\nSpallanzani, more than one year elapses before the limb, bones, and\r\ncartilages of _Triton_ regain their normal strength.\r\n\r\nThe Anura are likewise capable of regenerating their limbs, the more\r\nreadily the younger the specimens. For instance, in a tadpole of _Rana\r\ntemporaria_, in which the fore-limbs were still hidden, the hind-limb, cut\r\nat the middle of the thigh, reproduced nineteen days later a knee, followed\r\nby a short two-toed stump. Ultimately the whole limb became completed. The\r\ntail of tadpoles regenerates very quickly and completely, even if it be cut\r\noff shortly before the final metamorphosis, when the tail would in any case\r\nbe reduced. Metamorphosed Anura have almost entirely lost this faculty, but\r\nnot absolutely. I myself have kept two specimens of _Rana temporaria_,\r\nwhich, when already adult, had each lost a hand at the wrist. First there\r\nwas only the clean-cut stump with a scar, but within a year this changed\r\ninto a four-cornered stump, and two of the protuberances developed a little\r\nfurther, reaching a length of about 4 mm. These specimens lived for four\r\nyears without further changes.\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE.–Amphibia, like Fishes and Reptiles, are, as a rule, classed as\r\ncold-blooded animals, in opposition to the warm-blooded Birds and Mammals.\r\nThis distinction is one of degree only. The terms poikilothermous and\r\nhomothermous (ποίκιλος, {68}variable; ὅμος, equable) are based upon a\r\nsounder principle, but are likewise liable to exceptions. Those creatures\r\nwhich, like Birds and Mammals, possess a specific temperature of their own\r\nunder normal conditions, that of hibernation being excepted, are\r\nhomothermous. Cold-blooded creatures have no specific temperature; they\r\nmore or less assume that of their surroundings. Frogs and newts, for\r\ninstance, when living in the water, naturally assume its temperature, which\r\nis, of course, many degrees lower in a cold spring than in a shallow pond\r\nwarmed by the sun on a hot summer's day. The same applies to the changes\r\nfrom day to night. Dark-coloured tortoises basking in the sun are sometimes\r\nso hot that they are disagreeable to touch, since they possess but little\r\nmechanism for regulating their heat. The same individual cools down during\r\na chilly night by perhaps 40° C. Anura are, however, very susceptible to\r\nheat; most of them die when their temperature rises to about 40° C. Under\r\nsuch conditions they die quickly when in the water, but in the air their\r\nmoist skin counteracts the heat, lowering it by evaporation; otherwise it\r\nwould be impossible for a tree-frog to sit in the glaring sun in a\r\ntemperature of 120° F. Toads and others with drier skins seek the shade,\r\nhide under stones, or bury themselves in the coolest spots available, and\r\nmany Amphibia and Reptiles aestivate in a torpid condition during the dry\r\nand hot season. Many of them can endure a surprising amount of cold, and\r\nduring hibernation their temperature may sink to freezing-point. This power\r\nof endurance does not apply to all alike; tropical species can stand less\r\nthan those which live in temperate and cold regions. In spite of many\r\nassertions to the contrary, it may safely be stated that none of our\r\nEuropean frogs, toads, and newts survive being frozen hard. They may be\r\ncooled down to nearly -1° C., and they may be partially frozen into the\r\nice. Circulation of the blood is suspended in such cooled-down frogs; their\r\nlimbs may become so hard that they break like a piece of wood, but the\r\ncitadel of life, the heart, must not sink much below freezing-point, and\r\nmust itself not be frozen, if the animal is to have a chance of recovering.\r\nThe protoplasm resists a long time, and so long as some of it is left\r\nunfrozen the rest will recover. Hibernating frogs are lost if they are\r\nreached by prolonged frost during exceptionally severe winters. Every frog\r\nwill be killed in an artificial pond with a clean concrete bottom, {69}but\r\nif there is sufficient mud, with decaying vegetable matter, the creatures\r\nsurvive, simply because they are not absolutely frozen. A severe winter not\r\ninfrequently kills off all the younger creatures, while the older and more\r\nexperienced hide themselves more carefully and live to propagate the race.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\nThere is a very ably written chapter on the geographical distribution of\r\nthe Amphibia by Boulenger in the _Catalogue of Batrachia Gradientia_, pp.\r\n104-118. He came to the important conclusion that the geographical\r\ndistribution of the Amphibia agrees in general with that of the freshwater\r\nfishes. Günther's division into a Northern, Equatorial, and Southern zone\r\nis modified only in so far as the last two are combined into one, \"Tasmania\r\nand Patagonia not differing in any point regarding their Frog Fauna from\r\nAustralia and South America respectively.\"\r\n\r\nBoulenger recognises–\r\n\r\n   I. The Northern zone–(1) Palaearctic, (2) North American, region.\r\n\r\n  II. The Equatorial Southern zone.\r\n\r\n    _A._ Firmisternia division = Cyprinoid division of Günther.\r\n\r\n      1. Indian region.\r\n\r\n      2. African region.\r\n\r\n    _B._ Arcifera division = Acyprinoid division of Günther.\r\n\r\n      1. Tropical American region.\r\n\r\n      2. Australian region.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on geographical distribution in Bronn's _Thierreich, Vögel,\r\nSystematischer Theil_, p. 296 (1893), and in my _Classification of\r\nVertebrata_ (1898), due attention had been paid to the Amphibia as well as\r\nto the other classes of Vertebrata. It will be seen in the following pages\r\nthat my arrangement is well applicable to the Amphibia so far as\r\nfundamental principles are concerned.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be sufficiently emphasised that any attempt to form the various\r\nfaunas of the different classes of animals into one scheme must necessarily\r\nbe a _petitio principii_. The time-honoured six zoo-geographical regions\r\nestablished by Sclater and Wallace represent fairly well the main\r\ncontinental divisions: North America, South America, Africa, Australia, and\r\nthe large northern continental mass of the Old World, with India as a\r\ntropical appendix. There is no correlation and no subordination {70}in this\r\nscheme. Huxley's division (1868) into NOTOGAEA and ARCTOGAEA (see p. 74) is\r\nof fundamental importance. The next improvement was the combination of the\r\nPalaearctic and Nearctic \"regions\" into one, an advance originally due to\r\nProfessor Newton, carried out by Heilprin (1887) as the Holarctic region. I\r\nhave, in 1893, substituted for it the more appropriate term _Periarctic_,\r\nmeaning the whole mass of land which lies around the indifferent Arctic\r\nzone. The want of further co-ordination and subordination required the\r\ncombination of the African and Oriental or Indian countries into a\r\n_Palaeotropical region_ (1893); the Ethiopian or African and the Indian or\r\nOriental regions of Sclater and Wallace thereby assuming their proper\r\nsubordinate rank of subregions.\r\n\r\nThe two primary divisions NOTOGAEA and ARCTOGAEA are fundamental. The four\r\nsecondary divisions, namely the _Australian_ and _Neotropical_,\r\n_Periarctic_ and _Palaeotropical regions_, also stand the test of\r\napplication to the various classes and main groups of Vertebrata; but\r\nnaturally, under the present configuration of the world, the Palaeotropical\r\nregion is nothing but the Southern continuation of the Eastern half of the\r\nPeriarctic mass of land. This is especially obvious so far as India is\r\nconcerned. There is, however, that broad belt of desert, sand, and\r\nsalt-steppes, which extends from North-West Africa to Manchuria, and this\r\nbelt is one of the most important physical features of the Old World. It is\r\ncomplicated by the system of mountain-chains which, broadly speaking,\r\ncentre at the Pamirs, and radiate westwards through the Caucasus and Alps\r\ninto Spain, eastwards through the Himalayas into China, and north-eastwards\r\nto Kamtschatka; interrupted by Bering's Sea, it is continued as the\r\nbackbone of both Americas to Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe tertiary divisions, the subregions, have no real existence. They depend\r\nupon the class, or even order, of animals, which we happen to study. The\r\nfaunistic distribution of the Urodela is not that of the Anura, and both\r\nfollow separate lines of dispersal, different from those of the various\r\norders of Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals. This must be so. There is no doubt\r\nthat the distribution of land and water was totally different in the Coal\r\nAge from what it is now. The face of the globe at the Jurassic Age can\r\nscarcely be compared with the aspect which the world has assumed in the\r\nMiocene period.\r\n\r\nThis leads to another consideration, often neglected.  We {71}know that the\r\nvarious classes, orders, families, etc., of animals have appeared\r\nsuccessively upon the stage. A group which arose in the Coal Age followed\r\nlines of dispersal different from one which was not evolved until Jurassic\r\ntimes, and post-cretaceous creatures could not avail themselves of what\r\nassisted their ancestors, and _vice versâ_. The Amphibia are bound\r\nabsolutely to the land and to fresh water; transportation across salt water\r\nis not excluded, but must be accidental, and is not a case of regular\r\n\"spreading.\" Speaking generally, the older a group, the more likely is it\r\nto be widely distributed. If it appears scattered, this may be due to\r\nextinction in intermediate countries or to submergence of former\r\nland-connexions.\r\n\r\nThere is great danger of arguing in a circle. It is one of the most\r\ndifficult tasks to decide in cases of great resemblance of groups of\r\nanimals between their being due to direct affinity or to heterogeneous\r\nconvergence, or parallel development. It is the morphologist who is\r\nultimately responsible for the establishment of faunistic regions, not the\r\nsystematist, least of all he who accepts an elaborate classification, and\r\nthen mechanically, mathematically, by lists of genera and species, maps out\r\nthe world. Let us take an example. The Neotropical region and Madagascar,\r\nbut not Africa, are supposed to be faunistically related to each other. In\r\nboth namely occur _Boa_ and _Corallus_ amongst snakes, Dendrobatinae\r\namongst Ranidae, and of the Insectivora _Solenodon_ in Cuba, _Centetes_ in\r\nMadagascar. More cases can no doubt be found which would strengthen this\r\nresemblance, perhaps in support of the startling view that Madagascar and\r\nSouth America have received part of their fauna from the famous Antarctica.\r\nBut the value of the Insectivores has been disposed of by their recognition\r\nas an extremely ancient group, or as a case of convergence, and the two\r\ngenera are no longer put into the same family as Centetidae. The\r\nDendrobatinae (_Mantella_ in Madagascar, the others in South America) are\r\ndecidedly not a natural group, but an instance of very recent convergence\r\n(cf. p. 272). About the members of the ancient Boidae we do not feel quite\r\nso sure.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore advisable to eliminate for zoogeographical purposes groups\r\nabout which there can be any reasonable doubt, otherwise we may argue that\r\ncertain genera must constitute a very old family, because they are now\r\nrestricted to widely {72}separated countries, or on the strength of their\r\ndistribution we may conclude that the genera in question cannot be related\r\nto each other, and do not belong to the same sub-family or family as the\r\ncase may be. Such groups are the Engystomatinae and the genus _Spelerpes_;\r\namongst reptiles the Eublepharidae, Helodermatidae, Anelytropidae,\r\nIlysiidae, Amblycephalidae.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to represent the various regions and sub-regions as if they\r\nhad boundaries as fixed as political frontiers. Such limitations are quite\r\narbitrary, and what is of more importance, they differ in reality according\r\nto the class or order of animals with which we happen to deal. Moreover,\r\nthere has been, and is probably still going on, an exchange or overlapping\r\nof faunas. Such debatable grounds are Central America and the highlands of\r\nNorth-western South America. The famous Wallace's line, between Borneo and\r\nCelebes, Java and Lombok, is absolutely inapplicable to the Anura. From\r\ntheir point of view the Austro-Malayan countries, Papuasia and Polynesia do\r\nnot form a sub-region of the Australian, but rather of the Palaeotropical\r\nregion. Concerning the Urodela, the division into Palae- and Ne-arctic\r\nsub-regions is unjustifiable since Eastern Asia has emphatically American\r\naffinities (cf. also p. 96). The Sahara and the rest of Northern Africa are\r\nintimately connected with Arabia, Persia, Afghanistan, and Northern India,\r\njust as equatorial Africa and Madagascar possess strong faunistic\r\nrelationship with Southern India and the Malay islands.\r\n\r\n_Limiting factors of distribution._–Common salt is poison to the Amphibia;\r\neven a solution of 1 per cent prevents the development of their larvae.\r\nConsequently seas, salt lakes, and plains encrusted with saline deposits\r\nact as most efficient boundaries to normal \"spreading.\" But undoubtedly\r\nmany individuals have made long and successful voyages across the seas on\r\nfloating trees. Solutions of lime are likewise detrimental to many species,\r\nand it is a general fact that limestone-terrain is poor in Amphibian life,\r\nunless, of course, sufficient accumulation of humus counteracts or prevents\r\nthe calcareous impregnation of the springs and pools in meadows.\r\n_Salamandra maculosa_ is, for instance, absent in Central Germany on the\r\nMuschelkalk, but it occurs in abundance in neighbouring districts of red\r\nsandstone or granite; nor can the larvae be reared successfully in very\r\n\"hard\" water. On the other hand, _Proteus_ lives in the {73}subterranean\r\nwaters of Carniola, where the whole country is nothing but limestone.\r\n\r\nCold is another powerful limiting factor. The absolute northern limit of\r\nAmphibian life coincides rather closely with the somewhat erratic line of\r\n0° Centigrade of annual mean temperature, a little to the north of which\r\nline the ground remains permanently frozen below the surface. The\r\nsurface-crust, which thaws during the summer, engenders an abundance of\r\ninsects as food-supply, but its freezing down to the icy bottom makes\r\nhibernation impossible. There are, of course, some exceptions, for instance\r\nthe occurrence of Urodela in the Schilka river and in the district of Lake\r\nBaikal.\r\n\r\nRanges of mountains are far less effective barriers than is generally\r\nsupposed. In many cases the fauna is the same on either slope, and they act\r\nrather as equalising or dispersing factors, especially when they extend\r\nfrom north to south. Witness the Andes, owing to which Ecuador and Peru\r\nbear a great resemblance to the Central American fauna, and differ from the\r\ntropical parts of South America. The existence of an _Amblystoma_ in Siam\r\nis another instance.\r\n\r\nThe more specialised a family the more intimately is it connected with the\r\nphysical features of the country. Typically arboreal frogs are dependent on\r\nthe presence of trees. Some have undoubtedly spread into treeless countries\r\nand have changed into prairie-frogs, e.g. _Acris_. They come out, so to\r\nspeak, as something different at the other end, and it is unlikely that\r\nthese modified descendants redevelop exactly the same features as their\r\nancestors before the migration. Baldwin Spencer[39] met with only six\r\nspecies of frogs in Central Australia, _Limnodynastes_, _Chiroleptes_,\r\n_Heleioporus_, and _Hyla_. They are in the main identical with certain\r\nforms found in the dry inland parts of New South Wales and Queensland. They\r\nare to be regarded as immigrants from the latter regions, which have been\r\nable in the majority of cases to adapt themselves to unfavourable climatic\r\nconditions by means of a marked development of the burrowing habit, to\r\nwhich in certain cases has been added a capacity for absorbing and holding\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n{74}FAUNISTIC DIVISIONS OF THE AMPHIBIA.\r\n\r\nNOTOGÆA.–SOUTH WORLD.\r\n\r\n* indicates Amphibia which are peculiar to the respective regions or\r\nsub-regions.\r\n\r\nCharacterised by the Cystignathidae* and by the predominance of Arcifera,\r\nwhich form nearly 90 per cent of the Anurous population.\r\n\r\nI. AUSTRALIAN REGION.–Absence of Apoda and Urodela. All the Anura are\r\narciferous, with the exception of one species of _Rana_ in the Cape York\r\npeninsula. The fauna of the Australian continent and of Tasmania consists\r\nchiefly of Cystignathidae and Hylidae (_Hyla_ and _Hylella_) and several\r\nsmall genera of Bufonidae (_Pseudophryne_,* _Notaden_,* and\r\n_Myobatrachus_*).\r\n\r\nIt is customary, and from the study of other Vertebrata quite justifiable,\r\nto divide the Australian region into several sub-regions, but the Amphibia\r\nlend no support to this. The only Amphibian in the Sandwich Islands is a\r\n_Bufo_, closely related to North American species. The only Amphibian in\r\nNew Zealand is _Liopelma_,* one of the Discoglossidae which are otherwise\r\nconfined to Europe, North-east Asia, and North-west America, and, to judge\r\nfrom their low organisation, had formerly a much wider distribution. New\r\nCaledonia possesses no Amphibia. The Fiji Islands are inhabited by one or\r\ntwo species of _Cornufer_, a genus of Ranidae. The same genus is typical of\r\nthe Austro-Malayan and Papuasian islands, the fauna of which consists of\r\n_Rana_ and _Cornufer_, _Ceratobatrachus_, several genera of Engystomatinae,\r\nHylidae, and Pelobatidae.\r\n\r\nII. NEOTROPICAL REGION.–Characterised by Apoda, Aglossa (_Pipa_), abundance\r\nof Cystignathidae (Hemiphractinae,* Cystignathinae, and\r\nDendrophryniscinae*), Hylidae (Hylinae and Amphignathodontinae*), numerous\r\nBufonidae and Engystomatinae; Dendrobatinae*; the Raninae are represented\r\nby a few peculiar genera, mostly restricted to the Andesian province; the\r\ngenus _Rana_ occurs there in a few species only.\r\n\r\nAbsence of Discoglossidae, Pelobatidae and Dyscophinae.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of Urodela, of the genus _Spelerpes_, extend from Central\r\nAmerica into the Andesian province, one occurs in Hayti, and _Plethodon\r\nplatense_ in Argentina.\r\n\r\nThis region is by far the richest in the number of families, {75}genera and\r\nspecies; the total number of the latter being, according to Boulenger,\r\nabout four-ninths of the known species. The region comprises South America,\r\nCentral America, and the West Indian islands. Central America is naturally\r\ndebatable ground; one species of _Hylodes_ and one _Engystoma_, besides\r\nabout twenty Hylidae, extend into North America proper, while possibly the\r\nRaninae have entered the Neotropical region from the north. _Bufo_ is too\r\ncosmopolitan to assist our conclusions. The occurrence of four species of\r\n_Hylella_ in South America, one in Australia, and one in New Guinea\r\nindicate that this is not a natural genus.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of the Amphibia the whole region can be divided into two\r\nsub-regions only: (1) The West Indian islands with Central America and the\r\nnorth-western Andesian province; (2) the rest of South America.\r\n\r\n\r\nARCTOGAEA.–NORTH WORLD.\r\n\r\nCharacterised by the absence of Cystignathidae.\r\n\r\nI. PERIARCTIC REGION.–Characterised by the Urodela, these being almost\r\npeculiar to the region (cf. p. 96). Absence of Apoda. Presence of\r\nDiscoglossidae, Pelobatidae, Bufonidae, Raninae. Few Hylinae occur.\r\n\r\nThe whole region can be subdivided into three sub-regions.\r\n\r\n1. Western Palaearctic.–Prevalence of Salamandrinae (_Salamandra_,*\r\n_Chioglossa_,* _Salamandrina_,* _Triton_); Proteidae (_Proteus anguinus_*);\r\n_Spelerpes fuscus_.*–_Discoglossus_, _Bombinator_, _Alytes_,* _Bufo_, _Hyla\r\narborea_, _Pelobates_,* _Pelodytes_,* _Rana_.\r\n\r\n2. Eastern Palaearctic.–Amphiumidae (_Cryptobranchus_); Salamandrinae\r\n(_Triton_, _Pachytriton_,* _Tylototriton_*); Amblystomatinae.–_Bombinator_,\r\n_Bufo_, _Hyla arborea_, _Rana_, _Rhacophorus_.\r\n\r\n3. Nearctic.–Amphiumidae (_Cryptobranchus_, _Amphiuma_*); Proteidae\r\n(_Typhlomolge_,* _Necturus_*); Sirenidae*; Amblystomatinae; most\r\nPlethodontinae; Desmognathinae.*–Discoglossidae, Pelobatidae\r\n(_Scaphiopus_*); _Bufo_; Hylidae (_Hyla_, _Acris_, _Chorophilus_); _Rana_.\r\n\r\nII. PALAEOTROPICAL REGION.–Characterised by the presence of Apoda and by\r\nthe great prevalence of Firmisternal Anura, which amount to nearly 90 per\r\ncent of the total population. {76}Absence of Urodela (except _Amblystoma\r\npersimile_*), of Cystignathidae, and practically of the Hylidae, only two\r\nof which occur in the Himalayan district. But this great chain of mountains\r\nshould not be included within the region, while the outlying spurs in Upper\r\nBurma (with _Amblystoma_) are debatable ground. The subdivision of this\r\nwidely extended region is beset with difficulties, chiefly on account of\r\nMadagascar and Papuasia. The fauna of Madagascar is very remarkable. All\r\nits Amphibia are Firmisternal, a mixture of African and Indian forms. The\r\nisland agrees with Africa, in opposition to the Oriental countries, in no\r\nspecial point; all the Raninae, except _Megalixalus_, _Rappia_, and two\r\nrather common species of _Rana_, belong to different genera. Madagascar\r\ndiffers from Africa by the absence of Apoda, of Aglossa, and Bufonidae. On\r\nthe other hand, it agrees with India or with the Malay islands, in\r\nopposition to Africa, by the possession of Dyscophinae, of the Ranine genus\r\n_Rhacophorus_, and the Engystomatine genus _Calophrynus_.\r\n\r\nAfrica and India agree with each other, and differ from Madagascar by the\r\npossession of Apoda, the genera _Bufo_ and _Nectophryne_, and by the close\r\nresemblance of several genera of Raninae.\r\n\r\nIndia, the Malay islands, and Papuasia with Melanesia possess Pelobatidae\r\n(_Leptobrachium_,* _Batrachopsis_,* _Asterophrys_*), and thereby differ\r\nconsiderably from Africa and Madagascar. _Batrachylodes_* of the Solomon\r\nIslands has unmistakable affinities with _Phrynoderma_* of Karen, between\r\nBurma and Siam; _Oreobatrachus_* of Borneo much resembles\r\n_Phrynobatrachus_* of West Africa; and _Cornufer_, typical of the Malay and\r\nMelanesian islands, occurs also in West Africa. All these Raninae indicate\r\nthat the Austro-Malayan and Melanesian islands belong to the Palaeotropical\r\nregion. _Ceratobatrachus_,* type of a sub-family, is peculiar to Melanesia.\r\n\r\nThere are consequently several possible modes of subdivision, all with a\r\ndifferent result, according to the group of Amphibia, which we may select\r\nas of leading importance, _e.g._ Apoda or Pelobatidae, or Dyscophinae and\r\n_Rhacophorus_. The Engystomatinae and Raninae are to be eliminated, since\r\nthey occur in all the countries in question. We have either to leave the\r\nwhole region undivided–and it is a significant fact that the {77}Indian\r\ncountries possess not one sub-family of their own–or we must break it up\r\ninto four provinces, not sub-regions:–\r\n\r\n  1. Ethiopian, or continental African, with Aglossa and Apoda, no\r\n  Pelobatidae, no Dyscophinae, few Bufonidae, and many Raninae.\r\n\r\n  2. Indian and Malayan, with Apoda, no Aglossa, but with Pelobatidae,\r\n  Dyscophinae, many Bufonidae and Raninae, amongst which _Rhacophorus_.\r\n\r\n  3. Malagasy, without either Apoda or Aglossa; with Firmisternal Anura\r\n  only, chiefly Dyscophinae, and _Rhacophorus_ and other Raninae.\r\n\r\n  4. Papuasian, without Apoda, Aglossa, Dyscophinae, and Bufonidae, but\r\n  with Pelobatidae and Ranidae.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTION OF FAMILIES AND SUB-FAMILIES OF THE AMPHIBIA.\r\n\r\n  Aus. = Australian.\r\n  N-t. = Neotropical.\r\n  N-a. = Ne-arctic.\r\n  Pal-arct. = Palae-arctic.\r\n  Eth. = Ethiopian.\r\n  Mal. = Malagasy.\r\n  Ind. = Indian.\r\n  Pap. = Papuasian.\r\n  N.Z. = New Zealand.\r\n\r\n  +––––––––––––––––––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+\r\n  |                    |Aus.|N–t.|N–a.|Pal–arct.|Eth.|Mal.|Ind.|Pap.|N.Z.|\r\n  |                    |    |    |    +––––+––––+    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |                    |    |    |    | W. | E. |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  +––––––––––––––––––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+\r\n  |Amphiumidae         |    |    |  + |    |  + |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Salamandridae       |    |  + |  + |  + |  + |    |    |  1 |    |    |\r\n  |Proteidae           |    |    |  + |  + |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Sirenidae           |    |    |  + |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Apoda               |    |  + |    |    |    |  + |    |  + |    |    |\r\n  |Aglossa             |    |  + |    |    |    |  + |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Discoglossidae      |    |    |    |  + |  + |    |    |    |    |  + |\r\n  |Pelobatidae         |    |    |  + |  + |    |    |    |  + |  + |    |\r\n  |Bufonidae           |  + |  + |  + |  + |  + |  + |    |  + |  + |    |\r\n  |Hylinae             |  + |  + |  + |  1 |  1 |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Amphignathodontinae |    |  + |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Hemiphractinae      |    |  + |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Cystignathinae      |  + |  + |  1 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Dendrophryniscinae  |    |  + |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Genyophryninae      |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  |Engystomatinae      |    |  + |  1 |    |    |    |  + |  + |  + |    |\r\n  |Dyscophinae         |    |    |    |    |    |  + |  + |  + |    |    |\r\n  |Dendrobatinae       |    |  + |    |    |    |    |  × |    |    |    |\r\n  |Raninae             |    |  + |  + |  + |  + |  + |  + |  + |  + |    |\r\n  |Ceratobatrachinae   |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |  + |    |\r\n  +––––––––––––––––––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+––––+\r\n\r\n  1 signifies the occurrence of only one species of an elsewhere numerous\r\n    group.\r\n  × _Mantella_, cf. p. 71 and p. 272.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{78}CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSTEGOCEPHALI OR LABYRINTHODONTS–LISSAMPHIBIA–APODA\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS I. STEGOCEPHALI OR PHRACTAMPHIBIA_\r\n\r\n_With a considerable amount of dermal armour, especially on the head._\r\n\r\nThe earliest known terrestrial four-footed creatures occur in the\r\nCarboniferous strata of Europe and North America. They and their immediate\r\nallies, which extend through the Permian into the Upper Trias, are now\r\ncomprised under the name of STEGOCEPHALI, so called because the whole of\r\nthe dorsal side of the cranium is covered, or roofed over, by dermal bones\r\n(στέγος, roof; κεφαλή, head). That these creatures, of which naturally only\r\nthe skeletal parts are known, were not fishes, is shown by the typically\r\npentadactyloid limbs; but to recognise them as Amphibia, and as distinct\r\nfrom Reptiles, is difficult, especially if the incipient Reptilia, which\r\nhave sprung from some members of this Stegocephalous stock, are taken into\r\naccount. However, they possess either two occipital condyles, or none, and\r\ntheir vertebrae are either pseudocentrous or notocentrous, but not\r\ngastrocentrous. Moreover, the whole skeletal organisation is still so\r\nideally generalised, that it is easy to derive directly from it the\r\narrangement prevailing in the Apoda and Urodela.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral column always comprises a well-developed, sometimes a very\r\nlong tail. The vertebrae exhibit three types, two of which are\r\nfundamentally distinct, while the third is a further development of the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\n1. _Lepospondylous and pseudocentrous._–The vertebra consists of a thin\r\nshell of bone surrounding the chorda dorsalis, and is composed of two pairs\r\nof arcualia, which meet each other, {79}forming a suture, along the lateral\r\nside of the vertebra, both partaking in the formation of a transverse\r\nprocess which carries the rib.\r\n\r\n2_a_. _Temnospondylous._–The vertebra is composed of three pairs of units,\r\nwhich remain in a separate, unfused state. Two of them are dorsal arcualia,\r\none of which tends to form the centrum of the vertebra, which then carries\r\nthe neural arch.\r\n\r\n2_b_. _Stereospondylous._–The three component units fuse by co-ossification\r\ninto a solid, amphicoelous vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe ribs are one- or two-headed, rather strong, but short, rarely reaching\r\nhalf-way round the body. They occur on all the vertebrae of the trunk and\r\non most of those of the tail. One pair of ribs connects one vertebra, the\r\nsacral, with the pelvis, of which the ilium and ischium are generally\r\nossified, rarely also a portion of the pubic region.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder-girdle is very primitive, greatly resembling that of the\r\nCrossopterygian fishes. It consists of the following bones:–a median,\r\nrhombic, or T-shaped interclavicle, a pair of clavicles, of cleithra, of\r\ncoracoids, and of scapulae. The limbs show the typical pentadactyle plan,\r\nbut even in these earliest Tetrapoda the hand possesses only four fingers,\r\nwith 2, 2, 3, 2 phalanges respectively. The foot has five toes, with 2, 3,\r\n4, 4, 3, or 2, 2, 3, 4, 3 phalanges.\r\n\r\nMany Stegocephali were possessed of a dermal armour, covering either the\r\nwhole body or only the under parts. Hence the term Phractamphibia (φρακτός,\r\narmoured). The armour consists of a great number of small cutaneous scales,\r\npartly calcified, or perhaps ossified, and arranged in many more or less\r\ntransverse rows. We can only surmise that these scales were covered by\r\ncorresponding epidermal sheaths. The skull is ideally complete in the\r\nnumber of separate bones which appear on its surface. Besides the outer\r\nnares and the orbits there is always an unpaired, small, interparietal\r\nforamen. The whole temporal region is completely roofed over. The following\r\nbones are present:–nasals, frontals, parietals, supra- and\r\nlatero-occipitals; lacrymals (unless fused with the jugals?), prefrontals,\r\npostfrontals, postorbitals, squamosals, and epi-(or opisth-)otics;\r\npremaxillaries, maxillaries, jugals, quadrato-jugals, and supra-temporals;\r\nquadrates, pterygoids, palatines, vomers, and an unpaired parasphenoid.–The\r\nlower jaw is composed of a pair of dentaries, {80}articulars, angulars, and\r\nsplenials. The dentaries and apparently sometimes the splenials, the\r\npalatines, maxillae, and vomers carry teeth. The eyes possess a ring of\r\nsclerotic bones.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. STEGOCEPHALI LEPOSPONDYLI.\r\n\r\nVertebrae pseudocentrous.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 1. BRANCHIOSAURI.–The young had several pairs of gill-arches,\r\nwhich, to judge from their size and from the fact that they are beset with\r\nnumerous nodules, denticles, or irregular little processes like\r\ngill-rakers–seem to have been exposed to the surface and to have carried\r\ngills. In the adult the arches and gills seem to be absent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.–A, Dorsal and B, ventral views of the cranium of\r\n_Branchiosaurus salamandroides_, × about 4. (After Fritsch.) C, Posterior\r\nview of the cranium of _Trematosaurus_, × about ½. (After Fraas.) _Br_,\r\nBranchial arches; _C_, condyle; _Ep_, epiotic; _F_, frontal; _J_, jugal;\r\n_L.O_, lateral occipital; _M_, maxillary; _N_, nasal; _No_, nostril; _Pa_,\r\nparietal; _Pl_, palatine; _Pm_, premaxillary; _P.o_, postorbital; _Pr.f_,\r\nprefrontal; _Ps_, parasphenoid; _Pt_, pterygoid; _Ptf_, postfrontal; _Q_,\r\nquadrate; _Qj_, quadrato-jugal; _S.o_, supraoccipital; _Sq_, squamosal;\r\n_St_, supratemporal; _V_, vomer.]\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest genera is _Branchiosaurus_, including _Protriton_. _B.\r\nsalamandroides_ of the Lower Red Sandstone of Europe is known in every\r\nstage, from larvae of 16 mm. to the full grown animal of 64 mm. in length.\r\nThe whole body was {81}covered with little cutaneous scales. _Pelosaurus_\r\nand perhaps _Melanerpeton_ are allied genera.\r\n\r\nThe following genera are small newt-like creatures of the Carboniferous age\r\nof Europe and North America. In _Keraterpeton_ of Bohemia, Ireland, and\r\nOhio, the dermal scales were restricted to the under parts; and the ribs\r\nwere rather long, reaching half way round the body. Gills have not been\r\nobserved. _K. crassum_, a European species, reached more than one foot in\r\nlength, two-thirds of which fall to the tail. The ventral side is covered\r\nwith a most elaborate armour, which consists of about eighty chevron-shaped\r\nrows of little scale-shaped nodules. The epiotic bones end in strange\r\nprocesses, carrying a pair of spikes, giving the skull a \"horned\"\r\nappearance, hence the generic name. _Urocordylus_ is an allied genus.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 2. AISTOPODES.–Body snake-like and without any limbs, hence the\r\nname ἄιστος, unseen; ribs long, and reaching half way round the body; from\r\nCarboniferous strata in Ireland and Bohemia, with allied, or perhaps\r\nidentical forms in Ohio. _Dolichosoma longissimum_ possessed more than 150\r\nvertebrae, and was about a yard long. The epiotics end in obtuse\r\nprojections, recalling those of _Keraterpeton_. These marvellous creatures\r\nhad strange appendages, extending from behind the sides of the head, which\r\nwere possibly the supports of external gills; since the upper end of one of\r\nthe visceral arches, probably the hyoidean arch, is attached to the\r\nlabyrinthic region, and from this arch starts a bony rod which carries long\r\nskeletal filaments. The body seems to have been naked.\r\n\r\n_Ophiderpeton_ had a compound ventral shield, while the skin of the back\r\ncontained granular scutes. Although the Aistopodes have, not without\r\nreason, been looked upon as greatly resembling the Coeciliae or Apoda in\r\norganisation, especially in that of the vertebral column, the total absence\r\nof any other fossils which might bridge over the enormous gulf between the\r\nCoal Age and recent times, makes the attempt to derive the Apoda from these\r\ncreatures very hazardous.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. STEGOCEPHALI TEMNOSPONDYLI.\r\n\r\nMostly with rather long ribs and with chiefly ventral armour.\r\n\r\n{82}_Chelydosaurus_ from the Lower Red Sandstone of Bohemia was 3 feet\r\nlong, and possessed a beautiful, complicated, ventral armour, consisting of\r\nabout sixty chevron-shaped rows, about three times as numerous as the\r\nvertebrae in the corresponding region. _Sphenosaurus_ from the same strata\r\nand localities must have been 2 yards long. The trunk-vertebrae of both\r\nthese genera were composed of four pairs of arcualia. _Trimerorhachis_ from\r\nthe Permian of Texas is very imperfectly known, but its trunk-vertebrae, as\r\nthe name implies, consist of three pairs of separate arcualia, one of\r\nwhich, the interdorsal pair, tends to form a kind of centrum.\r\n\r\n_Dissorophus multicinctus_, also from the Permian of Texas, has been\r\ndescribed by Cope[40] as a \"Batrachian Armadillo,\" and considered allied to\r\n_Trimerorhachis_. Ten vertebrae are known, of an aggregate length of 93\r\nmm.; the length of the creature was perhaps one yard. The neural spines are\r\nelevated, and the apex of each extends in an arch on each side to the ribs.\r\nThese spinous branches touch each other, forming a carapace. Above, and\r\ncorresponding to each of them, is a similar dermal and osseous element,\r\nwhich extends from side to side without interruption in the median line,\r\nforming a dermal layer of transverse bands which correspond to the skeletal\r\ncarapace beneath it. This creature remotely approaches the genus\r\n_Zatachys_, Cope, where a dermosteous scute is co-ossified with the apex of\r\nthe neural spine. The systematic position of this genus is at least\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\n_Archegosaurus decheni_ from the Lower Red of Germany, known by many\r\nwell-preserved specimens, reached a length of 4 or 5 feet. The trunk\r\nvertebrae are tri-partite, those of the tail quadri-partite, like those of\r\nthe trunk of _Chelydosaurus_. Young specimens show traces of gill-arches.\r\nThe thoroughly terrestrial walking limbs have four fingers and four toes;\r\nthe arrangement of the tarsalia, most of which are ossified, lend support\r\nto the view that the morphological axis went through femur, fibula,\r\nintermedium, the centralia, the second distal tarsale, and the second toe.\r\nThe dentine and enamel of the teeth are much folded, and this feature,\r\nwhich applies to most members of this Order, to a lesser degree also to\r\nothers, has caused them to be comprised under the name of LABYRINTHODONTA.\r\nThe upper {83}surface of the head shows very characteristically arranged\r\ngrooves, which probably contained slime-canals and possibly sensory organs.\r\n\r\n_Actinodon_ and _Euchirosaurus_ are closely allied forms, chiefly from the\r\nLower Red Sandstone of France; _Gondwanosaurus_ occurs in the Permian of\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER III. STEGOCEPHALI STEREOSPONDYLI.\r\n\r\nThese are the most highly developed members of the typical Labyrinthodonta,\r\ncharacterised by their much-folded teeth, and by their solid, bi-concave\r\nvertebrae. _Loxomma_ occurs in the Upper Carboniferous of England and in\r\nthe Lower Red of Bohemia: _Trematosaurus_, _Capitosaurus_, and _Metopias_\r\nfrom the New Red or Lower Trias to the Keuper of Germany. _Mastodonsaurus_\r\nfrom the Trias of England and Germany is the most gigantic Amphibian known,\r\nwith a skull of nearly 1 yard in length.\r\n\r\n_Labyrinthodon_ from the Keuper of Warwickshire is one of the latest\r\nmembers of the group. Labyrinthodont creatures have also been described\r\nfrom the Trias of South Africa, _e.g._ _Rhytidosteus_; those from North\r\nAmerica are insufficiently preserved.\r\n\r\nMany of these and allied genera have left their footprints in slabs of\r\nSandstone, both Lower and New Red, in Europe, Africa, and America. But\r\nalthough their spoors are common enough, only a few can with certainty be\r\nreferred to Stegocephali, _e.g._ _Saurichnites salamandroides_ of the Lower\r\nRed of Germany. The spoors of _Chirotherium_, common in the New Red of\r\nGermany and England, for instance in Cheshire, belong to unknown owners;\r\nboth the large hind feet (which measure nearly half a foot in length) and\r\nthe much smaller fore feet, had five digits, the first of which stood off\r\nlike a thumb. Five-fingered Stegocephali are unknown.\r\n\r\nThere is an almost complete absence of fossil Amphibia from the Upper Trias\r\nto the Oligocene. The Stegocephali as such seem to have died out with the\r\nTrias. The recent Amphibia, of course, must have had ancestors in the\r\nMesozoic age. There is one little skeleton, from the Wealden of Belgium,\r\nwhich belonged to a newt-like creature, called _Hylaeobatrachus croyi_.\r\nScarce fragments, described as _Megalotriton_, are known from the Oligocene\r\nof France, and _Triton_ itself seems to be indicated by {84}remnants in the\r\nLower Miocene of France and Germany. But fairly complete specimens of large\r\ncreatures, much resembling _Cryptobranchus_, have been found in the Upper\r\nMiocene of Oeningen, Canton Solothurn, Switzerland. The first known\r\nspecimen, now at Haarlem, indicating a total length of 3 feet or more, was\r\ndescribed and figured in the year 1726 by Scheuchzer, in a learned\r\ndissertation entitled \"_Homo diluvii testis_.\"\r\n\r\n  Betrübtes Beingerüst von einem alten Sünder\r\n  Erweiche Herz und Sinn der neuen Bosheitskinder.\r\n\r\nWhich may be rendered as follows:–\r\n\r\n  Oh, sad remains of bone, frame of poor Man of sin\r\n  Soften the heart and mind of sinful recent kin.\r\n\r\nThis was the motto attached to the illustration, and it remained a warning\r\nto mankind until Cuvier declared the skeleton to be that of some large\r\nnewt. Tschudi named it _Andrias scheuchzeri_, but it is scarcely\r\ngenerically distinct from _Cryptobranchus_, being almost intermediate\r\nbetween _C. alleghaniensis_ and _C. japonicus_, see p. 97.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS II. LISSAMPHIBIA._\r\n\r\n_Amphibia without dermal armour._\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. APODA OR LIMBLESS AMPHIBIA.\r\n\r\nThe Amphibia Apoda, Coeciliae or Gymnophiona, are a small group of\r\nworm-shaped, burrowing creatures, restricted to the Neotropical and\r\nPalaeotropical regions, excluding Madagascar. They have no limbs and no\r\ngirdles. The tail is extremely short; the vertebrae are pseudo-centrous,\r\nand most of them carry rather long ribs, none of which, however, meet to\r\nform a sternum. The whole snake-like body is covered with a smooth and\r\nslimy skin which forms numerous transverse folds or rings.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature of the SKULL is its solid compactness, which\r\nstands in direct correlation with the burrowing habits of these creatures.\r\nThe whole dorsal surface of the cranium is practically roofed in by bone,\r\nso that, in this respect, it greatly resembles that of the Stegocephali;\r\nbut this resemblance is produced chiefly by a broadening of those bones\r\nwhich exist also in the other Lissamphibia, while supratemporals and\r\nsupra-occipitals are absent.\r\n\r\n{85}[Illustration: FIG. 13.–Skull of _Ichthyophis glutinosa_. × 3. (After\r\nSarasin.) A, Lateral, B, ventral, C, dorsal view. _A_, Posterior process of\r\nthe os articulare; _Ca_, carotid foramen; _Ch_, choana or posterior nasal\r\nopening; _F_, frontal; _J_, jugal; _Lo_, lateral occipital; _Mx_,\r\nmaxillary; _N_, nasal; _No_, nostril; _O_, orbit; _P_, parietal; _Pa_,\r\npalatine; _Pm_, premaxillary; _Pof_, postfrontal; _Prf_, prefrontal; _Pt_,\r\npterygoid; _Q_, quadrate; _S_, squamosal; _St_, stapes; _T_, tentacular\r\ngroove; _Vo_, vomer; _X_, exit of vagus nerve.]\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a pair of bones which represent either the postorbitals\r\nor the postfrontals, perhaps both, of the Stegocephali. The quadrato-jugal\r\narch is enormously developed, and by reaching the parietal, frontal, and\r\npostorbito-frontal bones (which latter occur only in _Ichthyophis_ and\r\n_Uraeotyphlus_) and the maxilla, extends over the whole of the\r\norbito-temporal fossa. The squamosal is completely fused with the\r\nquadrato-jugal. The stapes has the typical stirrup-shape, is even\r\nperforated by an artery, and articulates distally with the shaft of the\r\nquadrate (as in the snakes). The maxilla is very large and broad. Owing to\r\nits broad junction with the quadrato-jugal arch, the prefrontal and\r\nfrontal, the orbital fossa is reduced to a very small hole, or the maxilla\r\ncompletely covers the eye. Somewhere between the latter and the nares the\r\nmaxilla is perforated by the tentacular groove. The periotic bones are\r\nrepresented by the prootics and epiotics; they fuse with the lateral\r\noccipitals and with the parasphenoid. The whole {86}orbito-ethmoidal region\r\nof the primordial skull is also turned into one mass of bone.\r\n\r\nThe angular element of the lower jaw forms a thick and large process which\r\nprojects upwards and backwards from the mandibular joint. The former\r\npossession of a splenial bone is indicated by the occurrence of a second\r\nseries of teeth in the mandibles of _Ichthyophis_ and _Uraeotyphlus_. Other\r\ngenera have vestiges of this second row, or it may be completely lost.\r\n\r\nThe hyoid and branchial apparatus is more primitive than in any other\r\nrecent Amphibia. In the larva the hyoid and the first and second branchial\r\narches are connected with each other by a median copular piece. The third\r\nbranchial arches are free from the rest, but are fused in the middle line,\r\nthe fourth are loosely attached to the previous pair. In the adult both\r\nfuse into one transverse, curved bar, and the second pair of branchials\r\nlose their connexion with the basal longitudinal piece and likewise form a\r\ntransverse bar.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are built upon the pseudocentrous type, are amphicoelous, and\r\nthe chorda is intravertebrally destroyed by cartilage, as in the majority\r\nof the Urodela. The number of vertebrae is great, amounting in some species\r\nto between 200 and 300, of which a few belong to the tail. The first\r\nvertebra is devoid of an odontoid process. The ribs are proximally\r\nbifurcated as in the Urodela.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are practically useless, being either more or less concealed under\r\nthe skin, or they are covered by the maxillary bones. All Coecilians\r\npossess a peculiar tentacular sensory apparatus, which consists of a\r\nconical flap-shaped or globular soft tentacle, which is lodged in a special\r\ngroove or canal of the maxilla, between the eye and the nose, whence it is\r\nfrequently protruded while the animal is crawling about. These tentacles in\r\nthe young _Siphonops_ lie, according to the Sarasins, quite close to the\r\neyes, but are later transferred nearer to the nose. The organ consists of a\r\npeculiarly rolled up and pointed fold which arises from the bottom of the\r\nsac or pit, where it receives a nerve. It is protruded by becoming turgid\r\nwith blood, and is retracted by a strong muscle. Into the lumen of the sac\r\nare poured secretions from the large orbital (Harderian) gland, to keep the\r\napparatus clean. Hence arose the mistaken {87}notion of its being a\r\npoison-organ. The whole structure is possibly an offshoot of the\r\nnaso-lacrymal duct.\r\n\r\nThe skin is most remarkable. In the ripe embryo the epidermis passes\r\nsmoothly over the surface. Beneath follow two layers of soft cutaneous\r\nconnective tissue, bound together by transverse or vertical lamellae, so\r\nthat ring-shaped compartments are formed, and in these are embedded\r\nslime-glands. In the adult each compartment is modified into an anterior\r\nglandular belt and a posterior space, from the bottom of which grow several\r\nscales. The number of cutaneous rings agrees originally with that of the\r\nvertebrae; but later, and especially in the hinder portion of the trunk,\r\neach ring breaks up into two or more secondary segments, and these no\r\nlonger agree with those of the skeleton. Each scale is beset with numerous\r\nsmaller scales which consist of hardened cell-secretions infiltrated with\r\ncalcareous matter. The whole scale is consequently an entirely mesodermal\r\nproduct of the deeper layers of the cutis. The usual statement that the\r\nskin forms imbricating lamellae, on the inner side of which appear the\r\nscales, is wrong. The \"lamellae\" can be lifted up only after the general\r\nepidermal sheath has been broken artificially in the constrictions between\r\nthe rings. No scales exist in the Indian genus _Gegenophis_ and in the\r\nAmerican _Siphonops_, _Typhlonectes_, and _Chthonerpeton_, a secondary loss\r\nwhich does not indicate relationship. The scales develop late in embryonic\r\nlife, and they are reasonably looked upon as inheritances from the\r\nStegocephali. The glands either produce slime, whose function seems to be\r\nthe keeping clean of the surface of the body, or they are squirt-glands.\r\nThe latter kind are also numerous and are filled with a fluid which is\r\nsqueezed out by muscular contraction, and seems to be poisonous, as it\r\ncauses sneezing to those who handle or dissect fresh specimens.\r\n\r\nThe Coecilians live in moist ground and lead a burrowing life. Their\r\ndevelopmental history has only recently been studied, and in but a few\r\nspecies, see _Ichthyophis_, p. 91, and _Hypogeophis_, p. 92. The female is\r\nfertilised internally, copulation taking place by means of eversion of the\r\ncloacal walls in the shape of a tube. The spermatozoa possess an undulating\r\nmembrane; the eggs undergo meroblastic division and the embryos have three\r\npairs of long external gills. Some are viviparous.\r\n\r\nThe snake-like, limbless shape of the body (Fig. 15) is, as in {88}snakes,\r\ncorrelated with an asymmetrical development of the lungs; the left is\r\nreduced, while the right is drawn out into a long cylindrical sac. The\r\nliver is likewise very long, and partly constricted into a great number of\r\nlobes. Owing to the great reduction of the ribs progression is effected in\r\nan almost earthworm-like fashion by the peristaltic motion of the skin,\r\nassisted by its numerous ring-shaped constrictions.\r\n\r\nThe systematic position of the Coeciliae has been, and is still, a\r\ncontroversial matter. The Sarasins took up Cope's suggestion, that their\r\nnearest allies are the Urodela, especially _Amphiuma_, and they went so far\r\nas to look upon _Amphiuma_ as a neotenic form of the \"Coecilioidea,\" which\r\nthey divided into Amphiumidae and Coeciliidae; the Coecilioidea and\r\nSalamandroidea forming the two sub-orders of the Urodela. They based this\r\nstartling conclusion chiefly upon remarkable resemblances between\r\n_Amphiuma_ and _Ichthyophis_, namely, (1) the mode of laying the eggs on\r\nland and coiling themselves around them; (2) the existence of remnants of a\r\ntentacular apparatus in _Amphiuma_; (3) Cope's statement that _Amphiuma_\r\nalone among the Urodela possesses an ethmoid like the Coeciliae. This\r\nlatter point is, however, erroneous; it has since been shown by Davison[41]\r\nthat _Amphiuma_ possesses no ethmoid bone, but that, instead of it,\r\ndescending plates of the frontals join below the premaxilla and function as\r\na nasal septum, with a canal for the olfactory nerves.\r\n\r\nWe look upon the Apoda with more reason as creatures which of all the\r\nLissamphibia have retained most Stegocephalous characters and at the same\r\ntime form a highly specialised group equivalent to the Urodela and the\r\nAnura. The following are Stegocephalous inheritances peculiar to the Apoda\r\nin opposition to the other recent Amphibia: retention of cutaneous scales\r\nwith calcareous incrustations, greatly resembling the scales of the\r\nCarboniferous Microsauri; occasional retention of post-frontal and lateral\r\nnasal or lacrymal bones, and of a second row of teeth in the mandible. To\r\nthese may be added the presence of epiotic bones, and the primitive\r\ncharacter of the branchial arches. The loss of all these characters would\r\nturn the present Apoda into limbless Urodela, but this assumption does not\r\njustify their inclusion in this Order. The possible homology of the\r\ntentacular apparatus has been discussed elsewhere, p. 45.\r\n\r\n{89}Fossil Apoda are not known; their subterranean life does not favour\r\npreservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.–Map showing the distribution of the Coeciliae or\r\nAmphibia Apoda.]\r\n\r\nOnly family, COECILIIDAE. About forty species are known. These have been\r\nplaced in seventeen genera, mostly on comparatively slight grounds, and\r\nseveral of these genera are probably unnatural, the distinctive characters\r\nhaving undoubtedly been developed independently in various countries. We\r\nhave to remember that the recent species are the remainder of a formerly\r\nmuch more numerous group; it is also likely that more will be discovered in\r\nthe tropical forests of South America and Sumatra.\r\n\r\nBoulenger[42] has distinguished them as follows:–\r\n\r\n  I.

A second species, _I. monochrous_, occurs\r\nin Malabar, Malacca, Borneo, and Java. _I. glutinosa_ reaches about one\r\nfoot in length, with a greatest thickness of a little more than half an\r\ninch. The general colour is dark brown or bluish black, with a yellow band\r\nalong each side of the body.\r\n\r\nThis species has been studied extensively by the Sarasins.[43] It breeds in\r\nCeylon after the spring monsoon. The ovarian egg is oval, measuring 9 by 6\r\nmm. The yolk is yellow; the blastoderm lies towards one of the poles. The\r\nstrong vitelline membrane becomes surrounded in the oviduct by a dense\r\nalbuminous membrane, which forms twisted chalazae, just like those of\r\nbirds' eggs, and by these two cords the eggs are strung together. Around\r\nall this lies another mantle of albumen. The female digs a hole close to\r\nthe surface in moist ground near {91}running water, and there lays about\r\ntwo dozen eggs. The egg-strings become glued together, entangled into a\r\nbunch, and the female coils herself round the bunch and remains in that\r\nposition, probably to protect the eggs against other burrowing creatures,\r\nas blind snakes (_Typhlops_ and _Rhinophis_) and certain limbless lizards,\r\nwith which the ground literally swarms. During this kind of incubation the\r\neggs assume a round shape, and grow to twice their original size, and the\r\nmature embryo weighs four times as much as the newly laid egg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.–_Ichthyophis glutinosa_ × 1. (After P. and F.\r\nSarasin.) 1, A nearly ripe embryo, with gills, tail-fin, and still with a\r\nconsiderable amount of yolk; 2, female guarding her eggs, coiled up in a\r\nhole underground; 3, a bunch of newly laid eggs; 4, a single egg, enlarged,\r\nschematised to show the twisted albuminous strings or chalazae within the\r\nouter membrane, which surrounds the white of the egg.]\r\n\r\nThe external gills are delicately fringed and red, and they move up and\r\ndown in the fluid of the egg. The body of the embryo is at first white, but\r\nbecomes pigmented with dark grey. A strong line of lateral sense-organs is\r\nformed, and a ring of them lies around the eye and others on other parts of\r\nthe head. The short tail develops a fin. Of the three pairs of gills the\r\nthird is the shortest, and is generally turned dorsalwards. In embryos of 4\r\ncm. in length the longest gill measures as much as 2 cm. Yolk is still\r\npresent in embryos which have reached the surprising length of 7 cm. Then\r\nthe gills begin to shrink a little, and at this time one pair of\r\ngill-clefts breaks through at the base of the third external gill.\r\n\r\nWhen the larvae are hatched the gills are lost. The young larva takes to\r\nthe water in a gill-less state, and moves about like an eel. At the bottom\r\nof the gill-hole on each side two arches are visible, and there are at this\r\nstage neither inner nor {92}outer gills. The larvae frequently come up to\r\nthe surface to breathe. The eyes are large and clearly visible, but the\r\ntentacles are still undeveloped. The epidermal sense-organs are numerous,\r\nand appear as white spots in the grey skin; about fifty extend from the\r\ngill-opening to the tip of the tail.\r\n\r\n_Ichthyophis_ seems to live a long time in the larval state. At last the\r\ngill-clefts close, the tail-fin disappears, and the tentacles come to the\r\nsurface. The whole skin assumes a totally new structure, and the fish-like\r\nlarva turns into a burrowing, subterranean creature so terrestrial that it\r\ngets drowned when made to remain in the water.\r\n\r\n_Hypogeophis._–According to A. Brauer[44] three species of Coecilians are\r\nfound in the Seychelles: _Cryptopsophis multiplicatus_, which is rare,\r\n_Hypogeophis rostratus_ and _H. alternans_. They live in moist ground, near\r\nthe coast in swamps, higher up in humus, under rotten trees and rocks, down\r\nto the depth of one foot. In the island of Silhouette, Brauer found them in\r\nbrooks, at least during the dry season, from May to September. The natives\r\ncall them \"vers de terre.\" They seem to propagate during the greater part\r\nof the year, provided there is sufficient moisture. The female coils round\r\nthe eggs, which vary from half a dozen to thirty in number, those of _H.\r\nrostratus_ measuring 7-8 mm., those of _H. alternans_ only 4-5 mm.\r\n\r\nThe embryos undergo their whole development in the egg. Four pairs of\r\ngill-clefts break through, the first between the hyoid and the first\r\nbranchial arch, the fourth between the third and fourth branchial arches.\r\nThere appears also a spiracular cleft between the quadrate and the hyoid\r\narch; this cleft is, however, only developed dorsally, and persists for a\r\nshorter time. The external gills appear at the same time as the clefts,\r\nupon the first three branchial arches; the third gill is the latest, and\r\nremains in a vestigial condition covered up by the two others. The gills,\r\nof which the second is the longest, are not (as stated by the Sarasins)\r\ndirect prolongations of the gill-arches, but they begin as button-like\r\ngrowths upon the arches. They begin to disappear with the absorption of the\r\nyolk, getting actually smaller. In embryos of 6 cm. they are 6 mm. long,\r\nwhile in embryos of 6.5 cm. they are reduced to 4.5 mm. in length. The\r\n{93}first to disappear is the third gill, of course by being resorbed; and\r\nthe clefts are closed before the creature leaves the egg. _Hypogeophis_ not\r\nleading an aquatic larval life possesses no tail-fin in the embryonic\r\nstate, the gill-holes are closed, and the epidermal sensory organs\r\ndisappear long before the time of hatching.\r\n\r\nVestiges of gills appear also on the hyoid and on the mandibular arch, but\r\non the latter they are of very short duration. Those of the hyoid gradually\r\nfuse with the first of the branchial gills, and these also concentrate with\r\ntheir bases so that they ultimately seem to spring from one common stem.\r\nBrauer remarks that the distinction between internal and external gills\r\nseems to be one of degree only; the hyoidean and mandibular gills namely\r\nstart from the hinder margin of the arches, just like the internal gills of\r\n_Torpedo_ according to Ziegler, while the other gills start from the sides\r\nof the branchial arches. He also found a pair of little swellings behind\r\nthe last gill-cleft, and an unpaired swelling (corresponding with a double\r\none in _Ichthyophis_) in front of the vent. Not unreasonably he sees in\r\nthese swellings the last, very transitional vestiges of the paired limbs.\r\n\r\n_Typhlonectes compressicauda_ of Guiana and Venezuela is one of the largest\r\nCoecilians, reaching a length of 18 inches, with a body-diameter of ¾ inch.\r\nThe general colour, as in most of these creatures, is olive brown to black.\r\nA sort of adhesive disc surrounding the vent occurs in this genus. Peters,\r\nwho described this species, found in one female six embryos of\r\ncomparatively enormous size, one of them being 157 mm. (more than 6 inches)\r\nlong, and 12 mm. thick, and devoid of a tail-fin. Instead of lateral\r\ngill-openings there is a \"bag\" on each side 55 mm. long, upon which is\r\ndistributed a blood-vessel. The Sarasins have examined the same specimen:\r\nThe gills are not a bag, but consist of two flat, unbroken membranes which\r\nare closely connected with each other. In fact the outer gills of all\r\nAmphibia may be said to begin in the shape of small bags, whence sprout\r\nsecondarily the gill-fringes; but in _Typhlonectes_ they form these flaps\r\ninstead of growing into the usual three gills. The embryos have no\r\nepidermal sense-organs, but plenty of skin-glands. Probably when born they\r\ntake at once to terrestrial life, the flaps are possibly shed at birth, and\r\nthere remains a little cicatrix.\r\n\r\n_Dermophis thomensis_ of West Africa (its other relations live in East\r\nAfrica, South and Central America) is also viviparous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{94}CHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLISSAMPHIBIA (_CONTINUED_)–URODELA\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. URODELA OR TAILED AMPHIBIA.\r\n\r\nThe recent tailed Amphibia, Salamanders and Newts in the wider sense, have\r\nbeen grouped into four families which can be conveniently diagnosed by the\r\nfollowing characters:–\r\n\r\n  Both the upper and lower jaws are furnished with teeth. Fore- and\r\n  hind-limbs are always present.\r\n\r\n    Maxillary bones present.\r\n\r\n      Eyes free and devoid of lids .......... AMPHIUMIDAE, p. 97.\r\n\r\n      Eyes with movable lids[45] .......... SALAMANDRIDAE, p. 102.\r\n\r\n    Maxillary bones absent.\r\n\r\n      Eyes without lids. Perennibranchiate .......... PROTEIDAE, p. 132.\r\n\r\n  Both jaws are toothless. The hind-limbs, the maxillary bones and eyelids\r\n  are absent. Perennibranchiate .......... SIRENIDAE, p. 136.\r\n\r\nThese four families are closely allied to each other, especially the\r\nAmphiumidae and the Salamandridae.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of the Urodela is essentially Periarctic,\r\nexcept that about one dozen species each of _Amblystoma_ and of _Spelerpes_\r\nextend southwards into Central America, and in the case of the latter genus\r\neven into the Andesian parts of South America. _Plethodon platense_\r\ninhabits Argentina.\r\n\r\nThe Urodela afford good reasons for dividing the Periarctic region into\r\nthree co-ordinate sub-regions, namely, Nearctic, Eastern and Western\r\nPalaearctic. The difference between the European and the Eastern Asiatic\r\nfauna is well marked; the two are–at least with our present\r\nknowledge–separated by a wide stretch of country very poor in Urodele\r\nforms; while, lastly {95}there are not a few resemblances between this\r\nEastern Asiatic and the American fauna. The Urodela thus lend no support to\r\nthe usual division of the Periarctic into a Palaearctic and a Nearctic\r\nsub-region. Nor is it possible to divide the Palaearctic into a Eurasian\r\nand a Mediterranean province. We have in this case to distinguish between\r\nan American, an Asiatic, and a European fauna. The Asiatic or Eastern\r\nPalaearctic sub-region assumes the central position, at least from a merely\r\ngeographical point of view. It would be unjustifiable to assume a spreading\r\nfrom this centre into Europe, and, on the other hand, into America. The\r\ncentre existed more probably in the Arctic circle, now devoid of Urodela.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.–Map showing the distribution of the Urodela.\r\n\"Ichthyodea\" = Amphiumidae + Proteidae + Sirenidae.]\r\n\r\nSo far as mere numbers of species are concerned the huge Asiatic or Eastern\r\nPalaearctic region is the poorest, but it is also the least explored, and\r\nChina will probably yield a good many new forms. We know at present only 15\r\nspecies, nearly all from the eastern half. These 15 species represent no\r\nless than 11 genera, 8 of which (= 73 per cent) are peculiar to the\r\nsub-region. Next comes the Western Palaearctic or European sub-region with\r\nabout 21 recent species of 5 genera, 4 of which are peculiar. America is by\r\nfar the richest, with no less than 66 species (36 eastern, about 16\r\nwestern, and the rest Central American, etc.), belonging to 19 genera, 17\r\nof which (= 90 per cent) are peculiar to the New World. But this richness\r\nin species is due mainly to the abundance of the two genera _Amblystoma_\r\nand _Spelerpes_, just as Europe is characterised by its many Tritons.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking features of the Asiatic sub-region is {96}its\r\ndifference from the European. They have very little in common.\r\n_Pachytriton_, _Tylototriton_, and two species of _Triton_ (_T.\r\npyrrhogaster_ and _T. sinensis_) are the only Salamandrinae, while all the\r\nrest are Lechriodont (see p. 102), like the American Urodela, excepting the\r\ntwo American Tritons, _T. torosus_ and _T. viridescens_.\r\n\r\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE URODELA\r\n\r\n  +–––––––––––––––+–––––––––––––––––+––––––––––––––––––+––––––––––––––––––+\r\n  |               |     Western     |     Eastern      |   American.      |\r\n  |               |   Palaearctic.  |   Palaearctic.   |                  |\r\n  +–––––––––––––––+–––––––––––––––––+––––––––––––––––––+––––––––––––––––––+\r\n  | Sirenidae     |     ...         |                  | 1 Siren          |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  | 1 Pseudobranchus |\r\n  |               |                 |                  |                  |\r\n  | Proteidae     | 1 Proteus       |                  | 1 Necturus       |\r\n  |               |                 |                  |                  |\r\n  | Amphiumidae   | (1 _Andrias_,   |    ...           | 1 Amphiuma       |\r\n  |               |       Miocene)  | 1 Cryptobranchus | 1 Cryptobranchus |\r\n  |               |                 |                  |                  |\r\n  | Salamandridae |                    Desmognathinae                     |\r\n  |               |                    ––––––––––––––                     |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  |  1 Thorius       |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  |  1 Haptoglossa   |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  |  3 Desmognathus  |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  |  1 Typhlotriton  |\r\n  |               |                 |                  |                  |\r\n  |               |                    Pleithodontinae                    |\r\n  |               |                    –––––––––––––––                    |\r\n  |               | 1 Spelerpes     |                  | 21 Spelerpes     |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  |  2 Manculus      |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  |  7 Plethodon     |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  |  3 Batrachoseps  |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  |  1 Typhlomolge   |\r\n  |               |     ...         |                  |  2 Autodax       |\r\n  |               |                 |                  |                  |\r\n  |               |                    Amblystomatinae                    |\r\n  |               |                    –––––––––––––––                    |\r\n  |               |                 | 1 Amblystoma     | 16 Amblystoma    |\r\n  |               |                 |     ...          |  1 Dicamptodon   |\r\n  |               |                 | 1 Batrachyperus  |                  |\r\n  |               |                 | 1 Ranidens       |                  |\r\n  |               |                 | 1 Geomolge       |                  |\r\n  |               |                 | 1 Onychodactylus |                  |\r\n  |               |                 | 2 Salamandrella  |                  |\r\n  |               |                 | 3 Hynobius       |                  |\r\n  |               |                 |                  |                  |\r\n  |               |                     Salamandrinae                     |\r\n  |               |                     –––––––––––––                     |\r\n  |               |     ...         | 1 Pachytriton    |                  |\r\n  |               |     ...         | 1 Tylototriton   |                  |\r\n  |               | 14 Triton       | 2 Triton         | 2 Triton         |\r\n  |               |  1 Salamandrina |                  |                  |\r\n  |               |  1 Chioglossa   |                  |                  |\r\n  |               |  3 Salamandra   |                  |                  |\r\n  |               +–––––––––––––––––+––––––––––––––––––+––––––––––––––––––+\r\n  |               | 21 species,     | 15 species,      | 66 species,      |\r\n  |               |       6 genera  |     11 genera    |      18 genera   |\r\n  +–––––––––––––––+–––––––––––––––––+––––––––––––––––––+––––––––––––––––––+\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of an _Amblystoma_, _A. persimile_, in the mountains of Siam\r\nand Burmah, is most suggestive, and others will in all probability be\r\nfound. It must also be borne in {97}mind that the differences between the\r\ngenera of Amblystomatinae are in reality very slight; and the same applies\r\nto the sub-families themselves. The presence or absence of teeth on the\r\nparasphenoid, the possession of amphi- or opistho-coelous vertebrae, do not\r\nmean much, and certainly do not forbid the notion that all the recent\r\nUrodela are the offspring of one common generalised stock which inhabited\r\nthe northern portion of the globe. Nothing is gained by hiding the solitary\r\nEuropean species of the essentially American genus _Spelerpes_ under the\r\nname of _Geotriton_. It is a _Spelerpes_ in all characteristic points.\r\nSpeaking broadly, each of the three principal sub-families of Salamandridae\r\nis characteristic of a sub-region; the Salamandrinae of the Western\r\nPalaearctic, the Plethodontinae of the American, while the Amblystomatinae\r\nare chiefly Asiatic, at least so far as diversity of genera is concerned.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. AMPHIUMIDAE.–Without gills in the perfect state. The gill-clefts\r\nare in a vanishing stage, being either reduced to one pair of small holes\r\nor being altogether absent. The maxillary bones are present. Teeth occur in\r\nboth jaws; those of the vomers form transverse rows. The vertebrae are\r\namphicoelous. The fore-limbs and hind-limbs are present, but small. The\r\nsmall eyes are devoid of lids.\r\n\r\nThis family is now represented by two genera, with only three species,\r\nfound in the United States and in Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\n_Cryptobranchus._–The limbs are functional, with four fingers and five\r\ntoes. The outer digits and the sides of the limbs are bordered with folds\r\nof skin. The head and body are stout and depressed; the tail is short,\r\nlaterally compressed, and provided with a fin. The skin is very glandular\r\nand slimy, and forms a thick, irregularly-shaped fold along the side of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n_C. (Menopoma) alleghaniensis._–The gill-clefts are normally reduced to one\r\npair, individually to the left cleft, the right closing up. There are,\r\nhowever, four branchial arches and vessels. The general colour is brown or\r\ngrey above, sometimes with darker patches, lighter below. The \"Hellbender\"\r\nreaches a length of nearly 18 inches (about 46 cm.), is entirely aquatic,\r\nand is apparently restricted to the rivers and streams of the mountainous\r\ndistricts of the Eastern United States. It is very voracious, living on\r\nworms and on fish, being much disliked by the fishermen, as it takes the\r\nangler's bait, and destroys great quantities of the valuable food-fish\r\n_Coregonus albus_. Although rather common and easily kept, its larvae still\r\nremain unknown.\r\n\r\n{98}[Illustration: FIG. 17.–_Cryptobranchus japonicus._ Japanese Giant\r\nSalamander. × ⅙.]\r\n\r\n{99}_C. japonicus_ s. _maximus_.–The Giant Salamander of Japan differs from\r\nits American relation in one essential point only, namely, by the absence\r\nof gill-openings and of the modifications of the branchial apparatus\r\nconnected therewith. It has but three branchial vessels, and the skeletal\r\narches are reduced to two. It lives in Japan and in China, from 600 to 4500\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, in small streams of mountain-meadows. It\r\nfeeds upon fishes, Amphibia, worms, and insects. It is easily fished with\r\nthe hook and is eaten by the Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe first living specimen was brought to Europe in 1829 by Th. von Siebold,\r\nits discoverer. It grew within a few years from 1 foot to 3 feet in length,\r\nand died in 1881, at least fifty-two years old. Another specimen lived in\r\nthe Hamburg aquarium for fourteen years, during which time it is said to\r\nhave grown 36 cm. (more than 14 inches), having attained a length of nearly\r\n4½ feet, or 134 cm. The largest specimen known measures 159 cm = 5 feet 3\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nThe life-history of this species is still imperfectly known. Japanese\r\npicture-books contain drawings of the adult and of larvae, the latter\r\nshowing three pairs of fringed external gills. Young specimens of 16 cm.\r\nlength have already lost the gills, but still retain a cleft on either side\r\nof the neck, in the shape of a horizontal slit, and this is soon after\r\nclosed up by the skin.\r\n\r\nThe best account has recently been given by Sasaki.[46] According to him\r\nthe Giant Salamander leads a solitary life, concealed in dark places, under\r\nrocks in swift-flowing, thickly shaded small brooks of clear and cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe animal may be easily captured with a fish-hook, baited with a fish,\r\nfrog, or several earth-worms, and tied to a string a few feet in length.\r\nThis is thrust by the aid of a small bamboo-stick into the salamander's\r\nretreat. The string is not tied to the stick, but the point of the loaded\r\nhook is forced into one end of it, far enough to keep it in place while\r\nthis end of the rod is pushed under the rock. When the bait has been thus\r\nbrought near the salamander, any bite will be instantly felt through the\r\n{100}rod. The latter is then withdrawn as quietly as possible, the hook and\r\nbait being left. As soon as a jerk of the string is noticed, a pull is\r\nmade, which generally ends in the capture of the unfortunate animal. If the\r\nfirst pull should fail, the bait is replaced as before, and a second\r\nopportunity is offered, which the unwary creature accepts as readily as the\r\nfirst. The fisherman, having obtained one bite, is sure of ultimate\r\nsuccess, as the salamander does not learn by experience to refuse the\r\nproffered morsel. When captured, it emits a peculiar slimy secretion,\r\nhaving an odour much like that of the leaves of the Japan pepper\r\n(_Xanthoxylon peperitum_). This secretion hardens into a gelatinous mass\r\nafter a short exposure to the air.\r\n\r\nTemminck and Schlegel state that the act of inspiration is ordinarily\r\nperformed once every 6-10 minutes. This is true for specimens kept in tubs;\r\nbut Sasaki is inclined to think that they perform this act less frequently\r\nin their native brooks. The eyes are so small that they are obviously of\r\nlittle importance; the salamanders capture their prey not by pursuing, but\r\nby waiting for its near approach, whereupon they seize it with their teeth\r\nby a swift lateral movement of the head. The eggs are said to be laid in\r\nAugust and September, and they form a string resembling a rosary. Each egg\r\nfloats in a clear fluid, inclosed in a bead-shaped gelatinous envelope, and\r\nthis is connected with the next by means of a comparatively small string.\r\nThe egg measures about 6 mm. by 4 mm., and is yellow everywhere except at\r\nthe upper pole, where it is whitish. All attempts to make _Cryptobranchus_\r\nbreed in captivity have failed hitherto, owing no doubt to the difficulty\r\nof obtaining the cool temperature of its mountain streams. Sasaki's\r\nsmallest specimens measured 19 to 20 cm. These had three pairs of very\r\nshort branchial processes, from 3 to 5 mm. in length, attached just inside\r\nthe branchial orifice. Each process was somewhat flattened and tapering,\r\nmost of them still with branchlets. In another specimen, 20.5 cm. in\r\nlength, the gills had almost wholly disappeared, but the branchial slits\r\nwere still visible. One of 24.5 cm. length showed no trace of gills, and\r\nthe branchial orifice was completely closed, but still marked by a light\r\nstreak.\r\n\r\n{101}[Illustration: FIG. 18.–_Amphiuma means._ × ⅕.]\r\n\r\n_Amphiuma means_ s. _tridactyla_.–The limbs are very much reduced, and end\r\nin two or three little fingers or toes. Just in front of the fore-limbs\r\nlies the pair of small gill-clefts, each guarded by two flaps of the skin.\r\nThere are four branchial arches. The general colour of this eel-shaped\r\ncreature is black, lighter below. The head is covered with numerous pores,\r\narranged in several rows, which unite in the region of the neck, so that\r\nonly two rows extend along the sides of the body. It reaches a length of\r\nthree feet, and lives in swamps or muddy waters, for instance in the\r\nditches of rice-fields, burrowing occasionally in the mud, feeding on\r\ncrayfishes, molluscs, small fishes, etc. It is confined to the\r\nsouth-eastern States of North America, from Carolina to Mississippi.\r\nAccording to Davison,[47] copulation takes place in May. The rather\r\nhard-shelled eggs are deposited in the following August or September, and\r\nare connected by a twisted cord. The female lies about them in a coil. The\r\nembryos, which are hatched in the month of November or December, have\r\nwell-developed external gills. By the following February they have\r\n{102}reached a length of from 68 to 90 mm. (about 3 inches), living in damp\r\nlocalities under rocks or rooted stumps, and have already lost their gills.\r\nThe legs are said to be relatively longer than they are in the adult.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. SALAMANDRIDAE (Salamanders and Newts).–Without gills in the perfect\r\nstate. Maxillaries are present. Both jaws are furnished with teeth. The\r\neyes are protected by movable lids, except in _Typhlotriton_. Fore- and\r\nhind-limbs present, although sometimes very much reduced.\r\n\r\nTo this family belong by far the greater number of tailed Amphibia. They\r\nhave been, for the sake of convenience, grouped into four sub-families, the\r\ndetermining characters of which are all internal and of comparatively\r\nslight importance. Little better is the division into _Mecodonta_, with the\r\nteeth of the palate in two longitudinal rows diverging behind and inserted\r\nupon the inner margins of the two palatine processes, which are much\r\nprolonged posteriorly, and _Lechriodonta_, in which the series of palatal\r\nteeth are restricted to the posterior portion of the vomers and form either\r\ntransverse or posteriorly converging rows.\r\n\r\n    I. Series of palatal teeth transverse, restricted to the posterior\r\n  portion of the vomers.

Vertebrae amphicoelous: _Salamandrinae_, p. 115.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. DESMOGNATHINAE.–Comprising only three genera, with five\r\nspecies, in North America. Five toes.\r\n\r\n_Desmognathus._–The tongue is attached along the median line, free behind,\r\noval in shape. Three species in the eastern half of the United States. _D.\r\nfuscus_ is one of the lungless Urodela, for which condition see p. 46. The\r\nskin is nearly smooth; parotoids prominent, gular fold strongly marked.\r\nGeneral colour above, brown suffused with pink and grey, sometimes with a\r\ndark lateral band; under parts mottled brown. The vomerine teeth are\r\nfrequently absent. Total length, about 4 to 5 inches. They live, carefully\r\nconcealed in the daytime, under {103}stones in or on the edge of the banks\r\nof little mountain streams. The eggs are laid in two long strings, and are\r\nwrapped round the body of the female like a rosary, the female having\r\nresorted to a hollow in the mud, below a stone or other suitable place. The\r\nouter envelope of each egg tapers out into a short stalk, and the several\r\nstalks all converge, or are glued together into one common knot, \"much like\r\na bunch of toy balloons held in the hand of a street vendor.\" The egg is\r\nsaid to be meroblastic. The larvae seem to remain in the egg until they are\r\nnearly adult, and they emerge at midsummer, with the gills already much\r\nreduced. The complete metamorphosis takes place in the autumn of the same\r\nyear. These little newts can, according to Wilder,[48] be collected all the\r\nyear round, in Massachusetts from March to December, except during the time\r\nof deep snow. They are nocturnal and are easily kept.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.–_Desmognathus fuscus_; female with eggs in a hole\r\nunderground. × 1. (After Wilder.)]\r\n\r\n_Thorius pennatulus_, from Orizaba, Mexico, the only species, is noteworthy\r\nfor its extremely large nostrils, and for the tongue, which is supported by\r\na central pedicle, free all round, and ending in a thick knob, which can\r\nprobably be protruded. The limbs are weak, and the digits are also much\r\nreduced. Total length, under 2 inches, or 50 mm.\r\n\r\n_Typhlotriton spelaeus_, of the Rock House Cave in Missouri, is blind, the\r\neyes becoming concealed by the skin during metamorphosis, when the gills\r\nare lost.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. PLETHODONTINAE.–The five genera of this almost entirely\r\nAmerican sub-family (only one species of which, _Spelerpes fuscus_, occurs\r\nin Europe) can be distinguished as follows:–\r\n\r\n  I. The tongue is attached by its central pedicle only, is free all round,\r\n  ends in a soft knob and can be shot out to a considerable distance.\r\n\r\n    With 5 toes: _Spelerpes_, p. 104.\r\n\r\n    With 4 toes: _Manculus_, p. 106.\r\n\r\n  {104}II. The tongue is attached along the middle line and cannot be\r\n  protruded out of the mouth.\r\n\r\n    Jaws with numerous small teeth.\r\n\r\n      With 5 toes: _Plethodon_, p. 106.\r\n\r\n      With 4 toes: _Batrachoseps_.\r\n\r\n    Maxillary and mandibular teeth few in number but very large.\r\n\r\n      With 5 toes: _Autodax_, p. 107.\r\n\r\n_Spelerpes._–Except in a few species the limbs are well developed and\r\npossess 4 fingers and 5 toes, which are either free or webbed. But in the\r\nColombian _S. parvipes_, still more in _S. lineolus_ of Orizaba and _S.\r\nuniformis_ of Costa Rica the limbs and digits are reduced to mere vestiges,\r\nand are practically without function, the body, with the extremely long\r\ntail, having assumed a wormlike shape. The young of many, if not all,\r\nspecies have a pair of short balancers below each nostril; in the adult\r\nthese organs are reduced to little swellings or lost completely. Several\r\nspecies are lungless, see p. 46.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of this genus, of which some twenty species\r\nare known, is very remarkable. The majority live in Mexico and in the\r\nUnited States, a few are found in Colombia and Northern Peru (_S.\r\naltamazonicus_ and _Plethodon platense_ being the only Urodeles hitherto\r\nrecorded from south of the equator), one in Hayti (_S. infuscatus_), two\r\n(_S. subpalmatus_ and _S. uniformis_) in Costa Rica, and _S. fuscus_ in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n_S. bilineatus_ is a little newt under 4 inches in length–60-95 mm.–found\r\nin the Atlantic States. It is brownish-yellow above, with a black lateral\r\nline extending from the eye to nearly the end of the tail. The under parts\r\nare bright yellow. It lives on land, in damp places, concealed during the\r\ndaytime under stones or old trees, whence it emerges after a rain or in the\r\ndusk of evening.\r\n\r\nAccording to H. H. Wilder,[49] \"the eggs are deposited in May and June in a\r\nsingle layer upon the lower side of submerged stones, each batch containing\r\n30 to 50 eggs. The stones which are suitable for this purpose must be in\r\nthe form of an arch, allowing the water to flow beneath. They are generally\r\nin the more rapidly flowing portions of the brook, but the depth of water\r\nmust be such that the eggs are at all times entirely submerged. They are\r\nattached to the stone by gelatinous threads, proceeding from the outer\r\nenvelope, and although they are generally contiguous, they {105}are each\r\nattached separately.\" The eggs are holoblastic. The larvae hatch early and\r\ncontinue for a long time in the larval state, probably two or three years.\r\n\r\n_S. porphyriticus_ s. _salmoneus._–Yellowish-brown or purplish-grey above\r\nwith tiny darker dots and markings. The sides of the body are\r\nsalmon-coloured, with a tinge of yellow. The under parts are whitish,\r\nturning into salmon-pink on the tail. This beautiful newt reaches about 6\r\ninches in length and has a very moist, slimy skin, which, combined with the\r\nlively motions of the creature, make it as slippery as an eel. It is found\r\nin the Alleghany range, from New York to Alabama.\r\n\r\nSpecimens which I am keeping prefer the wettest part of the cage, where\r\nthey lie concealed in the moss and mud, leaving their hiding-places at\r\nnight in search of insects. One of them escaped into the greenhouse and was\r\ndiscovered after nine months, having established its permanent home in a\r\ncleft between mossy stones: when the sweepings of a butterfly-net are\r\nemptied near its hiding-place it peeps out and with a flash of its long,\r\nforked, white-coloured tongue it secures its prey. Occasionally it goes\r\ninto a tank, when it swims with rapid, undulating motions, the limbs being\r\nlaid back and remaining inactive; it sometimes rises to the surface to emit\r\nand to take in air, but, although mostly resting half in the water, upon a\r\nrotten stump, it often lies for hours at the bottom without stirring. When\r\nkept in dry surroundings, the skin soon dries and wrinkles, and the animals\r\nshow every sign of suffocation and general discomfort. The respiration of\r\nthis lungless species by means of rapid movements of the throat is very\r\nlimited, most of the necessary oxidisation of the blood being effected\r\nthrough the skin.\r\n\r\n_S. fuscus._–This, the only European species, is thoroughly terrestrial. It\r\nis found in the mountains bordering the Gulf of Genoa, and in Sardinia. Its\r\ntotal length remains under four inches. The smooth, very delicate and\r\neasily broken skin is brown above, light below, and speckled with lighter\r\nand darker markings. Below each nostril is a slight swelling, the remnant\r\nof the cirri or balancers common to the young of many species. It lives in\r\nshady surroundings, under stones, in old trees and in limestone-caves,\r\nglued to the walls with spread-out toes, belly and tail, quietly waiting\r\nfor insects and spiders which it catches by flashing out the long tongue.\r\n\r\n{106}According to J. Berg,[50] it keeps well in cool, moist and\r\nwell-ventilated places. It lives on flies, small beetles, and maggots; ants\r\nare also taken at once, probably owing to their lively movements, but a few\r\nminutes later the newts roll about in spasms and soon die. Towards the end\r\nof March one of Berg's specimens gave birth to four young, which were 36\r\nmm., or nearly 1½ inches long, and differed from the adult only by their\r\nexceptionally large nostrils, thereby resembling the Mexican _Thorius_. The\r\nlittle ones shot out their tongues about 10 mm., feeding on Aphides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.–_Spelerpes fuscus_, showing the position and shape\r\nof the partly and fully protruded tongue. The figure on the right side\r\nshows the tongue and the skeleton of the hyoid apparatus. _B_, the\r\nthreadlike, elongated, first branchial arch; _H_, hyoid, in reality\r\nattached by its outer end to the vicinity of the quadrate; _T_, tongue.\r\nAbout × 2. (After Berg and Wiedersheim.)]\r\n\r\n_Manculus._–The two species of this genus live in Carolina and Florida. _M.\r\nquadridigitatus_ is a very slender, graceful little animal, about 3 inches\r\nin length, the long and thin tail being considerably larger than the rest\r\nof the body. Yellowish, minutely speckled with brown above and on the\r\nsides, greyish-white below. Life entirely terrestrial.\r\n\r\n_Plethodon._–About seven species in North America. This genus has given its\r\nname to that of the subfamily, which might with more reason be called\r\nSpelerpinae.\r\n\r\n_P. glutinosus_ is slaty or bluish-black, with small whitish specks,\r\nespecially on the sides of the trunk, where they are large and often\r\nconfluent. The skin is smooth and shiny. Total length about 5 inches, half\r\nof which belong to the tail. Holbrook considered this as one of the\r\ncommonest of the North American newts, and mostly widely distributed, from\r\nOhio to the Gulf of Mexico. It usually lives concealed under stones, but\r\nprefers fallen trees, probably on account of the insects upon which it\r\n{107}preys. When taken in the hand it gives off a great quantity of slime.\r\n\r\n_P. erythronotus_ extends into Canada and is much smaller. Brown or grey\r\nabove, mostly with a broad, reddish-brown band over the head, back, and\r\ntail. The under parts are white, with grey and brown specks.\r\n\r\n_Autodax_ s. _Anaides_.–The large tongue is attached along the median line.\r\nThe jaws are furnished with few, but surprisingly large, knife-shaped\r\nteeth, about ten in the upper and fewer in the lower jaw. The small teeth\r\nof the vomers form a chevron-shaped series behind the choanae, those of the\r\nparasphenoid stand in one elongated patch. The tail is round; number of\r\ntoes, five. Three species in Western North America, from California to\r\nOregon.\r\n\r\n_A. lugubris._–The eyes are very large and prominent. The upper jaw shows a\r\npeculiar recess on either side for the reception of the large lower teeth.\r\nThe skin is smooth, devoid of parotoid glands, but has a strong gular fold.\r\nThe upper parts are dark brown or lead-coloured, with whitish dots on the\r\nsides; under parts white. Total length some 6 inches, about half of which\r\nbelongs to the tail. The fingers and toes are very rich in subcutaneous\r\nvenous sinuses.\r\n\r\nThe habits of these creatures are in many respects peculiar. Van\r\nDenburgh[51] says of _A. iecanus_ \"that it usually moves quite slowly,\r\nmoving one foot at a time, but is capable of motion surprisingly rapid for\r\na salamander. When moving rapidly, it aids the action of its legs by a\r\nsinuous movement of its whole body and tail. The latter is prehensile.\r\nSeveral individuals, when held with their heads down, coiled their tails\r\naround my finger, and, when the original hold was released, sustained\r\nthemselves for some time by this means alone. One even raised itself high\r\nenough to secure a foothold. This animal's tail is also of use in another\r\nway. When caught, it will often remain motionless, but if touched, will\r\neither run a short distance with great speed, or quickly raising its tail\r\nand striking it forcibly against the surface on which it rests, and\r\naccompanying this with a quick motion of its hind-limbs, will jump from\r\nfour to six inches, rising as high as two or three.\"\r\n\r\nRitter and Miller[52] have made extensive observations on the life-history\r\nof _A. lugubris_. When wishing to pass from the hand to {108}the table, the\r\ncreature will frequently execute a well co-ordinated spring and alight on\r\nits feet some distance away, instead of falling over the edge in the\r\ntypical salamander-fashion. This species is nocturnal and entirely\r\nterrestrial, and seems to be indifferent even to proximity to water. Rotten\r\nstumps and logs are the habitations preferred, and wherever these occur in\r\nthe region about San Francisco Bay, even though at the places remotest from\r\nwater, specimens are sure to be found.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid in a hollow under ground, and the female seems to remain\r\ncurled around them until they are hatched, which takes place in two or\r\nthree weeks. The specimen observed by Ritter and Miller laid 19 eggs. Each\r\nwas contained in a gelatinous capsule 6 mm. in diameter, and was firmly\r\nanchored to a clump of earth by a narrow peduncle about 8 mm. long. The\r\nembryos developed very large gills, each being composed of three broad\r\nmembranous lobes, the latter being thin and delicate, much expanded, highly\r\nvascular and widely confluent at their bases, so that the gills of each\r\nside really form one three-lobed mass. Their dorsal surfaces are applied to\r\nthe inner surface of the egg-capsule. The amount of food-yolk is\r\nconsiderable. The whole larval life is passed through within the egg.\r\nBefore the young is hatched the gills wither and cease to be functional,\r\nand the gill-slits close up. The tail is round, and shows no indication of\r\na fin at any time during the larval period. Newly hatched individuals\r\nappeared much distressed when put into water, and were quite unable to\r\nswim. They immediately sank to the bottom and remained there until they\r\nwere removed. The integumentary sense-organs, so well developed in the\r\naquatic larvae of Urodeles, are entirely wanting. When hatched the young\r\ncreature is about 32 mm. long; its general colour is blackish-grey, finely\r\nsprinkled with bluish-silver. During the second year this garb is changed\r\nto the dusky brown of the adult, and the fine silver speckling is replaced\r\nby much larger and less numerous yellow spots.\r\n\r\nAlthough one of the most terrestrial of Urodeles, this species is lungless,\r\nbut the skin remains delicately smooth and moist throughout life. According\r\nto the observers quoted, the pharynx plays an important part in\r\nrespiration. From 120 to 180 or even more vibrations are made by the throat\r\nin a minute, and in some cases these movements are grouped into series of\r\nabout {109}20 to 25 extremely rapid vibrations, with periods between each\r\ntwo series.\r\n\r\nSUBFAM. 3. AMBLYSTOMATINAE.–Composed of seven closely allied genera, the\r\ndistinguishing characters of which are the grouping of the palatal teeth\r\nand the number of the toes, which varies between 4 and 5. The geographical\r\nrange of the subfamily extends over the whole of North America and Mexico\r\nand over the whole of Northern Asia, from Kamtchatka and Japan westwards to\r\nthe Ural, and southwards into China. The occurrence of one species,\r\n_Amblystoma persimile_, in the mountains of Siam, makes it highly probable\r\nthat other species and genera exist in the hitherto unexplored intervening\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nBoulenger gives the following synopsis:–\r\n\r\n  I. The series of palatal teeth converge backwards, forming a V-shaped\r\n  figure.\r\n\r\n    With 5 toes: _Hynobius_, 3 species in Japan.\r\n\r\n    With 4 toes: _Salamandrella_, 2 species Lake Baikal, Ussuri and Schilka\r\n    rivers, and Kamtchatka, p. 109.\r\n\r\n  II. The series of palatal teeth form an uninterrupted, doubly arched\r\n  V-shaped figure.\r\n\r\n    The 4 fingers and 5 toes are furnished with black, horny claws:\r\n    _Onychodactylus japonicus_.\r\n\r\n  III. The series of palatal teeth form two arches, convex forwards,\r\n  separated by a wide interspace.\r\n\r\n    The two series are short, confined to the space between the choanae.\r\n\r\n      With 5 toes: _Ranidens sibiricus_, Eastern Siberia and N.E. China.\r\n\r\n      With 4 toes: _Batrachyperus sinensis_, Moupin in China.\r\n\r\n    The series are long and converge backwards, 5 toes: _Dicamptodon\r\n    ensatus_, California.\r\n\r\n  IV. The palatal teeth are arranged in a nearly straight, transverse line,\r\n  or they form an angle which points slightly forwards; they are not\r\n  separated by a wide median space. With 5 toes: _Amblystoma_. Some 16\r\n  species in North and Central America, one in Siam, p. 110.\r\n\r\n_Salamandrella keyserlingi._–The mode of propagation of this newt-like\r\nspecies has been observed by Shitkow near Jekaterinburg in the Ural\r\nmountains. The eggs were laid at the end of April and were deposited in\r\nbags, which were attached to a plant, with one end about an inch below the\r\nsurface of the water. The bag measured 15 cm. in length and 2 cm. in width\r\nand contained 50 to 60 eggs. The larvae were hatched in 14 days in a sunny\r\naquarium; in another with a northern {110}aspect the hatching took 23 days.\r\nThe larvae were 10 mm. long, and remarkable for the length (1 mm.) of their\r\nbalancers.\r\n\r\n_Amblystoma opacum._–The general shape is very much like that of the\r\nEuropean Spotted Salamander. The head is short and broad, the snout is\r\nrounded. The eyes are very prominent, with a black pupil and a dark-grey\r\niris. The neck has a well-marked gular fold. The tail is thick and almost\r\nround. The hind-limbs are considerably larger than the fore-limbs. The\r\ngeneral colour of the shiny, moist skin is a purplish-black with light\r\ngrey, transverse, partly confluent bars, giving the creature a pretty\r\nappearance; the under parts are paler, bluish-grey. Total length between 3\r\nand 4 inches, or 9 cm.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful species inhabits many of the United States east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, from New Jersey to Florida and Texas. In the perfect state it is\r\nthoroughly terrestrial and easily kept. My specimens prefer the holes of\r\nrotten and moist, moss-covered stumps, or holes beneath stones, which they\r\nleave, at night only, in search of earthworms and insects.\r\n\r\n_A. talpoideum_ is closely allied, somewhat stouter and almost uniform\r\nbrownish-back. According to Holbrook, \"it chooses light soil in which it\r\nwill bury itself in a few seconds like a mole, and there continue its\r\ncourse concealed from view; but its track can often be followed by the\r\nelevation produced on the surface of the soil, similar to that seen in\r\nfields infested by moles.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.–Egg-sac of _Salamandrella schrenki_. × ½. (After\r\nShitkow.)]\r\n\r\n_A. punctatum_ is bluish-black, with a row of roundish yellow spots on each\r\nside of the body and tail and upon the limbs.\r\n\r\nE. A. Andrews[53] has made observations upon the breeding of this species.\r\nNear Baltimore the eggs are very abundant in March and even in February, in\r\nsmall pools in the woods, but the adults are then rarely seen. Even when\r\nsmall pools, but 4 feet wide and 9 inches deep, were thoroughly raked out\r\n{111}before and after the eggs appeared, no adults were found, so that it\r\nis to be inferred that the laying takes place in the night and that the\r\nadults leave the water every day to conceal themselves under stones. One\r\nfemale was found moving away from a bunch of eggs early in the morning.\r\nThis specimen was kept isolated, and laid many eggs, and as these developed\r\ninto normal larvae, the existence of internal fertilisation was proved.\r\nPreviously to the laying of the eggs white spermatophores were found in the\r\nsmall pools, on the dead twigs and leaves covering the bottom.\r\n\r\n_A. jeffersonianum._–This very slender and slippery species, reaching a\r\nlength of 6 inches, is remarkable for its long fingers and toes, and its\r\nrather compressed tail. The general colour is brown above, dirty whitish\r\nbelow, generally with numerous, small, light blue and pale brown spots on\r\nthe sides of the neck, body, limbs, and tail. There are several\r\ncolour-varieties, one of them with white specks. It is a very active and\r\nsurprisingly good climber, easily escaping out of high-walled bell-glasses,\r\nhiding in the daytime in dark and moist localities. Its range extends from\r\nIndiana and Virginia to Quebec.\r\n\r\n_A. persimile._–This species is remarkable on account of its geographical\r\ndistribution. It is the only non-American species, inhabiting the higher\r\nmountains of Siam and Upper Burmah. There is no doubt about its belonging\r\nto the genus _Amblystoma_, although it had originally been described as a\r\n_Plethodon_. It closely resembles _A. jeffersonianum_ in most of its\r\ncharacters, notably in the arrangement of the palatal teeth, general\r\nproportions, slender toes, and even in the presence of whitish spots, which\r\nare scattered over the sides of its blackish, smooth skin.\r\n\r\n_A. tigrinum._–This, the commonest species, is conspicuous for its large,\r\ndepressed head, which is as broad as it is long, its width being enhanced\r\nby the unusually large parotoid glands. The mouth is very wide. The large,\r\nprominent eyes are golden, and reticulated with brown. The gular fold is\r\nstrong. The limbs are stout, the fingers and toes short. The trunk is\r\nstrongly constricted by twelve intercostal grooves. The tail, which is as\r\nlong as the rest of the body, is somewhat compressed laterally, but bears\r\nno trace of a fin. The general colour is more or less dark brown or bluish\r\nblack, marked with numerous yellow spots and large blotches; the under\r\nsurface inclines to {112}grey. The length of the adult male is about half a\r\nfoot; the females, as usual being larger, sometimes reach the length of 9\r\ninches. The range is from New York to California and to Central Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe larva of this species is the famous Axolotl. It is provided with three\r\npairs of delicate and much-branched external gills, a flat, long tail with\r\na broad ventral and dorsal fin, the latter extending along the back almost\r\nto the neck. The limbs, although comparatively slender, are fully\r\ndeveloped, and the head is much more pointed than it is in the perfect\r\nform. The larvae usually reach 8 or 9 inches in length; exceptional\r\nspecimens have been recorded of one foot in length, and have been described\r\nas _Triton ingens_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.–Axolotls or larvae of _Amblystoma tigrinum_. × ½.]\r\n\r\nThese larvae were found by the Spanish conquerors to occur in great numbers\r\nin the lakes near Mexico City, and were called Axolotl by the natives, a\r\nword signifying \"play in the water.\" They were, and are still, eaten,\r\neither roasted or boiled, with vinegar or cayenne pepper.\r\n\r\nFor many years these creatures were looked upon as a species of the\r\nPerennibranchiata, under the generic name of _Siredon_ (_S. axolotl_, _s.\r\npisciformis_, _s. mexicanus_, etc.), although Cuvier suspected that they\r\nwere but the larvae of an otherwise unknown terrestrial Urodele. The\r\nmystery was not cleared up until the year 1865, when some Axolotls which\r\nhad been kept for a year in the Jardin des Plantes at Paris, suddenly began\r\n{113}to pair, and laid eggs which within six months developed into\r\nfull-sized Axolotls. This certainly looked as if these creatures were not\r\nlarvae, but a true Perennibranchiate species. But to the general surprise\r\nseveral of these young Axolotls gradually lost their gills, the clefts\r\nclosed up, the fins of the back and tail disappeared, the head became\r\nbroader, the creatures left the water permanently, and in fact turned into\r\nthe already well-known terrestrial _Amblystoma tigrinum_. The other\r\nbrothers and sisters of the same brood remained aquatic Axolotls, which\r\nthereby revealed themselves after all as the larval and not as the perfect\r\nstage of this remarkable species.\r\n\r\nAt the suggestion of Kölliker and Weismann, Frl. Marie von Chauvin[54]\r\nundertook, at the University of Freiburg, long and carefully conducted\r\nexperiments, showing (1) that little Axolotls can comparatively easily be\r\ncaused to develop further into the perfect _Amblystoma_ if they are induced\r\nto breathe air more frequently than usual; shallow vessels, perhaps also\r\ninsufficiently aerated water, will produce the desired result; (2) that the\r\ncommencing metamorphosis can again be checked, the shrinking gills then\r\nundergoing fresh development; (3) that they can be forced to remain\r\nAxolotls; (4) that the cutting off of the gills has no influence upon their\r\npossible metamorphosis, the gills being easily and quickly renewed. The\r\nsame lady found also that _Amblystoma_, the perfect form, lives in the\r\nwater during the pairing time and behaves in the same way as the Axolotls.\r\n\r\nThe latest observations have been made by Metzdorff.[55] Axolotls, at least\r\nthose which are kept in captivity in Europe, are ready for propagation\r\nseveral times in the year, either in the spring, from April to June, or in\r\nDecember. The male deposits spermatophores, which in the following night\r\nare taken up by the female into the cloaca. On the following day,\r\npreferably in the afternoon, she grasps a suitable leaf, for instance that\r\nof _Vallisneria_, with the hind-limbs, and presses it against the vent. The\r\neggs are expelled by strong wriggling movements of the body, and are formed\r\ninto three or four packets of six to ten eggs each, so that about thirty\r\neggs are laid at one sitting. {114}Then she takes a rest before proceeding\r\nagain; the whole process, in which the male takes no further interest,\r\nlasting about two days. The most suitable temperature is one of 18-20° C.,\r\nor about 68° F. The water must be well aerated. Sterile eggs turn white on\r\nthe second day. The little larvae are hatched in about a fortnight. Eggs\r\nwhich are kept in a higher temperature, from 22-24° C., develop more\r\nquickly, but the resulting young are smaller; they show already on the\r\nfifth day head, tail, and the beginning of the gills. According to\r\nBedriaga, they live at first upon Infusoria and _Daphnia_; when they are\r\n20-25 mm. long they eat _Tubifex rivulorum_; later on they take scraped\r\nmeat and are liable, when hungry, to nibble off each other's gills, but\r\nthese are easily reproduced. When 20-25 cm. long, at the age of about six\r\nmonths, they are able to breed. The chief point of interest is the fact\r\nthat this species of _Amblystoma_ frequently remains throughout life in the\r\nlarval state, except that it develops generative organs. The natural causes\r\nof this retention are not completely known. According to Shufeldt, who\r\nobserved them under natural conditions near Fort Wingate in New Mexico,\r\nplenty of food, the drying up of the swamps, and the increasing temperature\r\nof the diminishing water, hurries on the metamorphosis, while deeper water\r\nretards it. Weismann[56] suggested that the specimens in the Mexican lakes\r\nwhich remained Axolotls were prevented from becoming perfect Amblystomas on\r\naccount of these lakes, after the disappearance of the surrounding forests,\r\nhaving receded from their former boundaries, which are now covered with a\r\nsaline, uninhabitable crust. This may be an explanation, although Axolotls\r\ndo not live in brackish water. But Weismann went farther, and with his\r\nwell-known dialectic powers has succeeded in spreading the belief not only\r\nthat the Axolotl is a case of reversion to an ancestral stage, but that the\r\npresent _Amblystoma_, instead of being the progressive, perfect form, is\r\nlikewise a case of reversion. A reversion from a reversion! The whole line\r\nof evolution would then be as follows: _Amblystoma_; its young, owing to\r\nadverse circumstances, revert to the stage of the Perennibranchiate\r\nancestors of all Urodela; if some of these Axolotls lose their gills and\r\nfins, they revert thereby into the original _Amblystoma_. {115}Surely a\r\nroundabout way of explaining a curious but after all rather simple process\r\nof Neoteny; cf. p. 63.\r\n\r\nObservations on the metamorphosis of _Siredon lichenoides_ into _Amblystoma\r\nmavortium_ have been made by Marsh, who also gives figures of the larval\r\nand adult forms.[57]\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 4. SALAMANDRINAE.–The six genera of this subfamily fall into two\r\nnatural groups: I, True Salamanders, with the palatal teeth arranged in a\r\npair of S-shaped figures, and without a fronto-squamosal arch. II, Tritons,\r\nwith the palatal teeth in the shape of a Λ, _i.e._ the right and left\r\nseries meet at an angle; the fronto-squamosal arch is present, either bony,\r\nor at least ligamentous. _Triton cristatus_ is, however, exceptional, in\r\nthat the two palatal series often do not meet and that the arch is absent.\r\nThe number of fingers is universally four, that of the toes is five except\r\nin _Salamandrina_, which has only four.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of the sub-family, entirely Periarctic, may\r\nbe said to be the reverse of that of the Amblystomatinae. Of the\r\ntwenty-five species namely, only two are American, four are Eastern\r\nAsiatic, and of the remaining nineteen, two are Algerian, while the rest\r\nlive in Europe or in Asia Minor. It is in fact an essentially Palaearctic\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nThe six genera can be distinguished as follows:–\r\n\r\n  I. The palatal teeth are arranged in two S-shaped curves. True\r\n  Salamanders.\r\n\r\n    Tongue short and thick. _Salamandra_, p. 115.\r\n\r\n    Tongue long and projectile. _Chioglossa_, p. 121.\r\n\r\n  II. The palatal teeth are arranged in a Λ shape. True Tritons.\r\n\r\n    With only four toes. _Salamandrina_, p. 122.\r\n\r\n    With five toes.\r\n\r\n      Pterygoids separated from the maxillary and quadrate bones: _Triton_,\r\n      p. 122.\r\n\r\n      Pterygoids touching the maxillae and quadrates. Himalo-Chinese:\r\n      _Tylototriton_, p. 132.\r\n\r\n      Pterygoids united broadly with the maxillae. Chinese: _Pachytriton_,\r\n      p. 132.\r\n\r\n_Salamandra._–Without fronto-squamosal arch. Five toes. Tail round. Three\r\nspecies in Europe and Western Asia.\r\n\r\n_S. maculosa._–The Spotted or Fire Salamander. General habit stout. Usual\r\nlength about 5 to 6 inches; the females are mostly larger than the males;\r\nspecimens of more than 8 inches in {116}length are giants. Head as broad as\r\nit is long, snout rounded. Limbs and digits stout and short. The skin is\r\nsmooth, shiny and full of pores, with a strong gular fold. The parotoid\r\nglands are large and covered with large pores. A series of distinct\r\nswellings, or cutaneous glands, each with a distinct opening, extends along\r\neither side of the back, and a shorter series along the flanks. The general\r\ncolour of the Spotted or Fire-salamander is black, with irregular, large\r\nyellow patches on the back and limbs. These markings vary extremely, so\r\nmuch so that scarcely two specimens, collected at random, are alike. In\r\nsome the yellow patches form two more or less regular bands, in others they\r\nare partly confluent; again the yellow may be preponderant on the back or\r\nmuch restricted. Occasionally the chrome-yellow is replaced by orange. The\r\nunder surface is as a rule bluish grey-black. This combination of shiny\r\nyellow and black is a good instance of warning colours. The creature is\r\npoisonous, cf. p. 38. When left in peace, or handled gently, it is\r\nperfectly harmless, but when treated with violence, or submitted to severe\r\npain, a milky white fluid exudes from the glands and is, under violent\r\ncontractions of the muscular skin and body, sometimes squirted out in fine\r\njets to the distance of a foot. Burning pain and subsequent inflammation\r\nresult if this poison gets into the eye. The same applies to the mucous\r\nlining of the mouth and throat. A few drops of this poison introduced into\r\nthe blood or into the stomach of a small animal are sufficient to cause its\r\ndeath. Cold-blooded animals are as susceptible as warm-blooded creatures.\r\n\r\nI once put two American bull-frogs into the same outdoor enclosure with a\r\nlarge number of salamanders. Next morning the huge frogs were found dead,\r\neach having swallowed a salamander, which they were not acquainted with and\r\nhad taken without suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe Fire-salamander has a wide range, namely the whole of Central,\r\nSouthern, and Western Europe with the exception of the British Isles. It\r\nextends southwards into Corsica and Algeria, eastwards through Asia Minor\r\ninto Syria. Where it does occur it is rather common, provided the terrain\r\nis mountainous or hilly and covered with vegetation. There it lives under\r\nmoss or rotten leaves, in the roots of old trees, in the cracks and clefts\r\nof the ground, of rocks or of ruins of buildings; {117}in default of\r\nanything better under heaps of stones, or in the holes dug by mice or\r\nmoles. One chief necessity for its happiness is moisture.\r\n\r\nThe salamander does not occur everywhere, but is rather local. On certain\r\nkinds of limestone it is rare or absent; granitic terrain and red sandstone\r\nseem to suit it best, for instance the Hartz Mountains, Thuringia, and\r\nHeidelberg are favourite localities. But even there we may spend days and\r\nweeks and never come across a single specimen. We may turn stones, rake up\r\nthe moss and leaves, pry into cracks, and we unearth perhaps a few\r\nsorry-looking, listless, dull and dry, half-emaciated creatures. The same\r\nplace after a thunderstorm will be literally swarming with sleek, lively\r\nsalamanders, in search of earthworms and all kinds of insects, especially\r\nat dusk or during the night. They disappear in the autumn, in October, to\r\nhibernate in the ground, out of the reach of frost, and they reappear again\r\nin April. Later on they congregate at little springs, always at running\r\nwater, to reach which they have often to make long migrations. This is the\r\nonly time when these thoroughly terrestrial creatures approach water, in\r\nwhich they easily get drowned.\r\n\r\nAlthough this species is so common its mode of reproduction has been\r\nsatisfactorily discovered only quite recently. There are some puzzling\r\nfacts which it took a long time to observe correctly and to interpret. The\r\nlarvae are born in April, May, or June, while there are no eggs in the\r\noviducts, but in July these are full of fertilised eggs before copulation\r\ntakes place. This seems contradictory. The explanation is as follows. In\r\nJuly there is an amplexus of the sexes, short, and often on land–a sort of\r\npreliminary exciting performance. Both sexes then descend into the water,\r\nbut generally remain on land with the fore part of the body. The male\r\ndeposits a spermatophore and the female takes part of this into its cloaca.\r\nIn the case of a virgin female the eggs are fertilised in the oviduct and\r\nripen until the autumn, but the larvae nearly ready for birth remain within\r\nthe uterus until the following May, _i.e._ about ten months. The mother\r\nthen crawls half into the water, mostly at night, and gives birth to from a\r\nfew to fifty young, fifteen being perhaps the average. The young are\r\nsurrounded by the egg-membrane, which either bursts before or shortly after\r\nexpulsion. This species is consequently viviparous in the proper sense. If\r\nshe produces a few young only, say from {118}two to five, these are much\r\nlarger and stronger than those of a large litter. Occasionally a few addled\r\nor only partly developed eggs are also expelled.\r\n\r\nIn the case of old females which have produced offspring before, the whole\r\nprocess is more complicated. The sperma, taken up in July, remains in the\r\nreceptaculum of the cloaca until the May or June following, _i.e._ until\r\nthe previous larvae have passed out of the uterus and are born. Then the\r\nspermatozoa ascend to the upper ends of the oviducts, where they meet and\r\nfertilise the new eggs. After these have descended into and filled the\r\nuterus, and are already developing into embryos, copulation takes place\r\nagain in July, preparatory for next year's eggs.\r\n\r\nThe new-born salamanders have three pairs of long external gills, a long\r\ntail furnished with a broad dorsal and ventral fin, and four limbs,\r\nalthough these are small. The total length is about 25 mm. or 1 inch. The\r\ngeneral colour is blackish with a pretty metallic golden and greenish\r\nlustre. The little creatures are very active, and at once eat living or\r\ndead animal matter. In captivity they are liable to nibble each other's\r\ngills and tails. During the first six or eight weeks they assume a row of\r\ndark spots on the sides; these spots enlarge, and the whole skin becomes\r\ndarker. Yellow spots appear next, first above the eyes and on the thighs,\r\nlater upon the back; the ground-colour at the same time becomes black,\r\nuntil at the beginning of the fourth month they look like the parents.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphosis is very gradual. The tail-fin diminishes first, but the\r\ngills grow until shortly before the little creatures leave the water.\r\nDarkness, cold, and insufficient food retard the metamorphosis, sometimes\r\nuntil October. It is easy to rear them artificially provided they are well\r\nfed, kept in a light place, and in clean, well aerated water. If prevented\r\nfrom leaving the latter, for instance when kept in a glass vessel with\r\nvertical walls, or if hindered by a piece of gauze from rising to the\r\nsurface and taking in air, they can be kept as larvae well into the winter.\r\n\r\nVery young, perfect little salamanders, of from 1 to 2 inches in length,\r\nare excessively rare; even specimens of 3 inches are far from common. They\r\nprobably spend the first two or three years of their life in careful\r\nseclusion.\r\n\r\nA few adults can be easily kept for many years in shady {119}places\r\nprovided with moss, rotten stumps and stones, to afford them suitable moist\r\nand cool hiding-places, and they readily take earthworms, larvae of\r\nbeetles, snails, woodlice, etc. But any attempt to keep them in large\r\nnumbers ends in failure. They congregate together in clumps, all making for\r\nthe same cavity or recess, as if that were the only one in existence (very\r\nlikely they are right in so far as that place is probably the best), and\r\nthey get rapidly enlarging sores, chiefly on the elbows and knees. These\r\nare soon infested with fungoid growths, and this disease spreads like an\r\nepidemic and soon carries them off.\r\n\r\n_S. atra._–The Alpine Salamander differs from the Spotted Salamander by its\r\nuniform black colour and smaller size, which averages between 7 and 5\r\ninches. It is restricted to the Alps of Europe, from Savoy to Carinthia, at\r\nfrom 2000 to as much as 9000 feet elevation, living with predilection near\r\nwaterfalls, the spray of which keeps the neighbourhood moist, or in mossy\r\nwalls, in the shade of forests near brooks, or under flat stones on\r\nnorthern slopes. The most interesting feature of this species is that it\r\nproduces only two young at a time. These are nourished at the expense of\r\nthe partially developed eggs in the uterus, and they undergo their whole\r\nmetamorphosis before they are born. By far the best and most complete\r\naccount of this mode of propagation has been given by G. Schwalbe.[58] The\r\nlength of the ripe embryos is about 45 mm.; they lie mostly bent up, with\r\ntheir heads and tails turned towards the head of the mother. The gills are\r\nbeautiful, delicate red organs, the first pair being generally directed\r\nforwards and ventralwards, the second upwards, the third backwards; they\r\nare longest when the creature is about 32 mm. long, while there is still\r\nmuch yolk present. At this stage the gills are so long as to envelop nearly\r\nthe whole embryo. There is rarely a second embryo in the same uterus, and\r\nan extra foetus is generally smaller, frequently a monstrosity not fit to\r\nlive; it is probable that it is not used as food, but that it is expelled\r\nat parturition. The embryo passes through three stages, (1) still enclosed\r\nwithin its follicle and living on its own yolk, (2) free within the\r\nvitelline mass which is the product of the other eggs, (3) there is no more\r\nvitelline mass, but the embryo is possessed of gills 10-12 mm. in length,\r\nand is still growing. During the {120}second stage the yolk is directly\r\nswallowed by the mouth. The walls of the maternal uterus are rather red.\r\nThe exchange of nutritive fluid takes place through the long external\r\ngills, which thereby function in the same way as the chorionic villi of the\r\nMammalian egg. Each gill contains a ventral artery and a dorsal vein, each\r\nof which looks like the midrib of a pinnate leaf; there is also a fine\r\nnerve and a weak bundle of striped muscular fibres. Each gill-filament\r\nreceives a capillary artery which extends to the epithelium of the tip,\r\nwhere it turns into a capillary vein. The epithelium of these filaments,\r\nwhich are full of blood, is ciliated, the resulting current being directed\r\nfrom the base towards the tip. In older larvae this ciliation becomes\r\nrestricted to the tips. The body of the gills is furnished with flat\r\nepithelium, these non-ciliated portions alone are closely appressed to the\r\nuterine wall, and it is here that the exchange of gas takes place between\r\nmother and larva. The nutrition takes place through the gills, as they are\r\nbathed by the yolk-mass.\r\n\r\nSchwalbe also explains the whole question of the reduction of the number of\r\nembryos. He says rightly that in _S. maculosa_, which gives birth to many\r\nyoung, there are in the oviduct many eggs which have only partly developed\r\ninto embryos, and these, perhaps from want of room and nourishment,\r\ndegenerate into the irregularly shaped whitish-yellow bodies which are\r\noccasionally found packed in between the developing embryos. Consequently\r\nall those eggs had been fertilised near the ovaries. _S. atra_ exhibits a\r\nfurther stage in so far as most of the eggs, fertilised above in the\r\noviduct, degenerate, and only two or three become fully developed. These\r\nfew embryos live on the degenerating eggs, which together produce the\r\nvitelline material spoken of above. The two full-grown and metamorphosed\r\nembryos, each measuring about 50 mm. in length, are equivalent to the\r\nnumerous new-born larvae of _S. maculosa_, especially if the smaller size\r\nof the adult Alpine Salamander is taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nMlle. von Chauvin[59] has experimented with the unborn larvae of this\r\nSalamander. She cut out 23 larvae and put them into water. One of them,\r\nalready 43 mm. long, took earthworms on the next day, and the beautiful\r\nlong, red gills became pale and shrunk, and on the third day were cast off\r\nclose to the {121}body. New gills sprouted out on the same day, first in\r\nthe shape of three tiny knobs on either side. After three weeks they had\r\nbecome round globes, which gradually sprouted out into several branches,\r\nfar shorter and more clumsy than the original gills. During the whole time\r\nthe larva was lying quietly at the bottom, in the darkest corner, but\r\nshowed a good appetite. The fin of the tail disappeared and was supplanted\r\nby a stronger one. In the sixth week the skin was shed in flakes, and this\r\nprocess took fifteen days. This larva lived in the water for fourteen weeks\r\nand grew to 6 cm. in length! When the new gills gradually shrank, the\r\ncompressed and finny tail assumed a round shape, the skin became darker and\r\nshinier, and after the larva had again shed its skin, there appeared the\r\ndark rugose skin of the typical _S. atra_. The gills were reduced to\r\nuseless appendages–not cast off–and the creature crawled out of the water.\r\nA fortnight later the gill-clefts were closed. A second larva behaved\r\nsimilarly, first casting off the feathery gills, substituting a new and\r\nstronger set, which, however, fourteen days after excision from the uterus,\r\nshrank again, and on the nineteenth day the gill-clefts were closed. The\r\nlady also observed that nearly ripe larvae, when cut out, rushed about in\r\nthe water and ate, just like the new-born larvae of the Spotted Salamander.\r\n\r\nA third species, _S. caucasica_, is found in the Caucasus. It rather\r\nresembles the Spotted Salamander in coloration, but has a larger tail and\r\nlacks the lateral warts. The male is remarkable for the possession of a\r\nsoft permanent knob or hook at the top of the root of the tail. This pommel\r\npossibly prevents the slipping off during the amorous amplexus, provided\r\nthe sexes then entwine like certain Tritons.\r\n\r\n_Chioglossa lusitanica._–The only species of this genus is restricted to\r\nthe north-western third of the Iberian peninsula. This graceful,\r\nslenderly-proportioned and beautiful Salamander is apparently very rare and\r\nlocal, having hitherto been found at a few places, namely, near Coimbra,\r\nOporto and Coruña. It lives under moss, and runs and climbs with an agility\r\nsurprising in a Urodele. The tongue is long, ending in a fork, and is\r\nsupported by a median pedicle so that the tip can be quickly protruded to\r\nthe distance of more than an inch. The whole length of the animal is about\r\n5 to 6 inches, two-thirds of which belong to {122}the long tail, which is\r\ncompressed at the end. The skin is smooth and shiny, with a gular fold and\r\nlarge parotoids. The general colour is a rich dark brown, with a pair of\r\nbroad reddish-golden bands along the back and tail, the bands being\r\nseparated by an almost black vertebral line.\r\n\r\nThe few specimens which I have been lucky enough to observe made little\r\nholes or passages in the moist moss of their cage, peeping out with their\r\nheads in wait for little insects, which they caught with flash-like\r\nquickness. They seem to be crepuscular.\r\n\r\n_Salamandrina perspicillata._–This genus, represented by one species, a\r\nnative of Liguria and Northern Italy, possibly extending into Dalmatia, is\r\nthe only Salamander which has but four toes. The skin is not shiny and\r\nsmooth, but is finely granular and dry, forms no gular fold, and is devoid\r\nof parotoid glands. The tail is more than half the length of the animal,\r\nwhich measures from 3 to 4 inches. The general colour is black-brown with a\r\nbroad V-shaped orange-yellow mark extending from eye to eye over the\r\nocciput. A faint irregular yellowish line extends along the middle of the\r\nback and tail. The throat is black, with a diffused white patch in the\r\nmiddle; the belly is white, with black dots; the anal region, the inner\r\nsides of the legs and the under side of the tail are carmine-red.\r\n\r\nThis slender and pretty Salamander is diurnal, and feigns death when\r\ndiscovered. Only the female goes into the water, in March, to glue the eggs\r\non to submerged rocks or water-plants. The young finish their metamorphosis\r\nby the month of June, and reach full size during the winter, the climate of\r\ntheir home being sufficiently genial to make hibernation scarcely\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n_Triton_ s. _Molge_.–The tail is strongly compressed and frequently has a\r\npermanent fin. The fronto-squamosal arch is variable, it being either bony\r\nas in the South European, Eastern and American species, or reduced to a\r\nligament, or lastly absent as in _T. cristatus_. The males of all the\r\nEnglish Newts, of _T. vittatus_ and of _T. marmoratus_, develop a high\r\ncutaneous crest on the back and tail during the breeding season, and this\r\ncrest acts not only as a swimming organ and ornament, but also as a sensory\r\norgan.\r\n\r\nThe whole genus comprises some eighteen species, twelve of which are\r\nEuropean, although some of these extend into Western {123}Asia; _T.\r\npyrrhogaster_ and _T. sinensis_ are found in N.E. China, the former also in\r\nJapan; _T. poireti_ and _T. hagenmuelleri_ live in Algeria, and only two,\r\n_T. torosus_ and _T. viridescens_, are North American. Some of the species\r\nhave a limited range; thus _T. montanus_ is confined to Corsica, _T.\r\nrusconii_ to Sardinia, _T. boscai_ to the north-west of the Iberian\r\npeninsula and _T. asper_ to the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nNewts all prefer moisture without heat. During the pairing season they take\r\nto the water, mostly to stagnant pools, which sometimes implies long\r\nmigrations. During this period, which is in some cases rather prolonged,\r\nthey become thoroughly aquatic and undergo some important changes. The\r\ntail-fins are much enlarged; in the males of some species a high cutaneous\r\nfold grows out on the back, devoid of muscles, but rich in sense-organs.\r\nThe whole skin, instead of being dry, possesses numerous mucous glands and,\r\nwhat is of more importance, specialised sensory apparatuses which are\r\narranged chiefly along the lateral lines of the body and part of the tail.\r\n\r\nAfter the breeding season Newts become terrestrial, hiding in cracks,\r\ntrees, or in the sandy soil. Some species aestivate during the hot and dry\r\nseason. They hibernate either in the ground, or occasionally in ponds. _T.\r\nvulgaris_ is difficult to keep in the water beyond the pairing season,\r\nwhile this is easily done with _T. alpestris_ and _T. cristatus_; _T.\r\nwaltli_ can live in the water for years. The food consists of all kinds of\r\ninsects, centipedes, worms, snails, etc., which are searched for chiefly at\r\nnight. It is astonishing to see a little Triton getting hold of and\r\ngradually swallowing a wriggling earthworm almost as thick and as long as\r\nitself. When two newts seize the same worm, as these voracious and jealous\r\ncreatures often do, each gets hold of one end, and swallowing as much as it\r\ncan, twists and rolls round in a direction opposite to that of its rival,\r\nuntil the worm breaks, or until the jaws of the two newts meet and the\r\nstronger of the two draws it out of the weaker one and swallows the whole\r\nworm. They do not drink, but soak themselves in the water.\r\n\r\nThe skin is shed periodically, and rather often by the rapidly growing\r\nyoung; by the adult, during the life in the water, rarely during the\r\nsojourn on dry land. The skin breaks round the mouth; assisted by the\r\nfingers and by contortions of the {124}body, it is then slipped backwards\r\nover the trunk and tail, whereupon the newt seizes the skin with the mouth,\r\ndraws the shirt off entirely, and–swallows it. Such freshly shed skins are\r\nvery delicate and pretty objects when suspended in water or some preserving\r\nfluid. The shed skin, consisting only of the outermost layer of the\r\nepidermis, is entire, but turned inside out, with fingers and toes\r\ncomplete, the only holes being those for the mouth, eyes, and vent.\r\n\r\nNone of the Tritons are viviparous. The eggs, which are glued singly or in\r\nsmall numbers on to stones or water-plants, are hatched in about a\r\nfortnight, sooner or later according to the species and the prevailing\r\ntemperature. The larvae are always provided with three pairs of branched\r\nexternal gills; the fore-limbs appear much earlier than the hind-limbs.\r\nMost, perhaps all, larvae develop two pairs of thread-like protuberances on\r\nthe sides of the upper jaw, by means of which they attach or anchor\r\nthemselves on to water-plants shortly after they are hatched. Thus moored\r\nthey remain motionless in a slanting position, now and then wriggling their\r\ntails and shifting their place, or sinking to the bottom. The metamorphosis\r\nis finished during the first summer, and the little newts, often partially\r\ntransparent, leave the water to hide under stones. Not unfrequently the\r\nmetamorphosis is retarded and not finished by the autumn. The larvae of _T.\r\ncristatus_, especially when reared in ponds with abrupt or overhanging\r\nbanks, so that they cannot leave the water, retain considerable remnants of\r\nthe gills, still more frequently the clefts, although breathing chiefly by\r\nthe lungs. Such individuals reach a length of 3 inches, and are larvae so\r\nfar as the finny tail and the gills are concerned. They hibernate in this\r\ncondition, and in exceptional cases reach sexual maturity;–at least the\r\nfemales, which develop ripe eggs; the males are not known to produce\r\nspermatozoa.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on the amorous games of newts, but it is only\r\nrecently that the mode of fecundation has been actually observed. Gasco[60]\r\nplaced the newts in glass vessels suspended from the ceiling of his\r\nlaboratory. The antics of the enamoured male around the female, rubbing the\r\nlatter with its head, or lashing it gently with the tail, and playing\r\naround it in its often beautiful nuptial dress, are meant to excite the\r\n{125}female. The male then at intervals emits spermatophores, which sink to\r\nthe bottom, and the female takes them up into its cloaca. For further\r\ninformation see p. 54.\r\n\r\n_Triton cristatus._–The Crested Newt has a slightly tubercular skin with\r\ndistinct pores on the head, on the parotoid region and on a line along the\r\nside of the trunk. There is a strong gular fold. The general colour above\r\nis dark or black-brown with an olive tinge, interspersed with darker spots;\r\nthe sides of the body bear irregular white spots. The under parts are\r\nyellow, almost always with large black spots. The iris is golden\r\nyellow.–The nuptial dress of the male is very striking. A high, serrated\r\ncrest occurs on the head and body; the upper surface of the head is marbled\r\nwith black and white; the under parts are orange-yellow with black spots,\r\nand the sides of the tail are adorned with a bluish-white band.–The female,\r\nalways devoid of a crest, generally exhibits a yellow line along the middle\r\nof the back.–The average length of fully adult specimens is about 5-6\r\ninches or 13-15 cm.; the females are as usual larger than the males; 144\r\nand 162 mm. for an English male and female respectively are exceptional\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.–_Triton cristatus._ 1, Female; 2, male in nuptial\r\ndress. × ⅔.]\r\n\r\nPropagation takes place in April. The newly hatched larvae are\r\nyellowish-green, with two black dorsal bands, and with a whitish edge to\r\nthe tail-fin. By the middle of July they are about 5 cm. long, and the\r\nwhite-margined tail now ends in a {126}thread 1 cm. in length. The general\r\ncolour above is light olive-brown, dotted with black; the flanks and belly\r\nhave a golden shimmer.\r\n\r\nThe Crested Newt has a wide distribution, extending from England and\r\nScotland through Central Europe into Transcaucasia; the northern limits are\r\nScotland and Southern Sweden. Although found in Greece and Lombardy, it\r\ndoes not occur in the Iberian peninsula nor in the South of France, where\r\nit is represented by the next following species.\r\n\r\n_Triton marmoratus._–The Marbled Newt is of the same size as the Crested\r\nNewt. Its ground colour is grass-green above, brown below, with numerous\r\nlarge and small irregularly shaped marbling patches, spots and dots of\r\nblack. The crest of the neck and trunk is entire, not serrated, adorned\r\nwith dark vertical bands, and separated from the high dorsal fin of the\r\ntail by a deep indenture or gap. The female has an orange line, slightly\r\nsunk in, instead of the crest. This newt is confined to France and the\r\nIberian peninsula. In the North of Portugal and in Galicia it is frequently\r\nseen in little streams and ponds during the months of March and April. The\r\nrest of the year it spends on land. In France occur hybrids of this species\r\nand _T. cristatus_. They have been described as _T. blasii_.\r\n\r\n_T. alpestris._–The Alpine Newt is easily distinguished by the rich orange\r\ncolour of its under parts, which are unspotted, excepting a few dark specks\r\nacross the throat, below the gular fold. Specimens with many ventro-lateral\r\nblack spots are exceedingly rare. All the upper parts are dark, but vary\r\nindividually. The prettiest specimens are dark purplish grey, with black\r\nmarblings; others incline more towards brown ground-tones, the blackish\r\nmarkings then appearing more prominent. The sides are often stippled with\r\ntiny whitish dots. The iris is golden yellow.–The nuptial male has a low,\r\nnot serrated crest, which extends uninterruptedly from the nape into the\r\ndorsal fin of the tail. The crest is pale yellow, with black vertical bands\r\nand spots. The ground-colour of the upper parts inclines to blue,\r\nespecially on the sides. The lower fin of the tail assumes an irregular\r\nband of bluish-white confluent patches.\r\n\r\nThis newt is rather small, females rarely exceeding 100 mm. or 4 inches in\r\nlength. Its home is chiefly the hilly and mountainous parts of Central\r\nEurope, from Holland to Lombardy, {127}Austria-Hungary, and Greece.\r\nAlthough it ascends the Alps to between 6000 and 7000 feet, it is also\r\nfound in the Netherlands, but not in the North German plain.\r\n\r\n_T. vulgaris_ (s. _taeniatus_, s. _punctatus_).–The Common or Spotted Newt\r\nusually reaches 3 inches (7-8 cm.) in length. Boulenger's record-specimen\r\nmeasured 104 mm. It is characterised by the yellow, partly orange under\r\nsurface, which is always spotted with black. The upper parts are\r\nolive-green or brown, inclining to white on the flanks; the black spots of\r\nthe back, sides, and especially of the tail, are arranged in more or less\r\ndistinct lines, giving a somewhat banded appearance to some females.–The\r\nbreeding dress of the male shows a non-serrated, but \"festooned\" high and\r\nvery wavy crest, which extends from the neck without interruption into the\r\nlikewise wavy tail-fin. The tail is adorned with a lateral, glittering blue\r\nstripe, interrupted by vertical dark spots. The larvae are marked by a\r\nseries of yellow dots, which extend over the lateral line and the tail,\r\nwhich latter temporarily possesses a terminal filament like that of the\r\nlarvae of _T. cristatus_.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the Spotted Newt is the same as that of _T. cristatus_,\r\nnamely Europe with the exception of the Iberian Peninsula, and Western\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\n_T. palmatus_ s. _helveticus_.–This is the smallest of all the European\r\nnewts, rarely reaching more than 3 inches in length. It is distinguished by\r\nseveral specific characters. The tail ends in a thread which is in some\r\nmales 10 mm. in length, but is only just indicated in the female. The\r\nbreeding male develops a cutaneous fold along each side of the back, and a\r\nlow, entire, vertebral crest; the toes are fully webbed. The under parts\r\nare pale yellow, inclining to orange towards the middle of the belly, and\r\nwith a few blackish dots. The lower caudal crest has its edge blue in the\r\nmale, orange in the female. The general colour of the smooth skin is\r\nolive-brown above, with numerous dark spots, which are arranged in more\r\nlongitudinal streaks on the head.\r\n\r\nThe Webbed Newt is a native of Western middle Europe, ranging from Great\r\nBritain and Northern Spain to Switzerland and Western Germany.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the last species are _T. boscai_ of Spain and Portugal,\r\n_T. italicus_, _T. montadoni_ of Moldavia, and the {128}beautiful _T.\r\nvittatus_ of Asia Minor. From China and Japan are known _T. pyrrhogaster_\r\nand _T. sinensis_.\r\n\r\nThe North American species are _T. torosus_ and _T. viridescens_. The\r\nformer, of Western North America, is one of the largest newts, reaching a\r\nlength of more than six inches. The head is much depressed and broad, and\r\nhas very prominent parotoid and other glands. The limbs are strong,\r\nespecially in the male. The skin of the upper parts is very granular,\r\nuniform dark brown, without a crest. The tail, which is larger than the\r\nhead and body, is strongly compressed, with a low dorsal and ventral fin.\r\nThe under parts and the lower edge of the tail are uniform yellow or orange\r\nred. The iris is green. A specimen in my keeping spends most of its time in\r\nthe cracks of rotten stumps or on the top of moss in the darkest shade. It\r\nlives on earthworms but despises insects. Like most of the other newts it\r\nbecomes lively at dusk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.–_Triton viridescens._ 1, Egg just after deposition,\r\nwith the outer membrane opened, × 6; 2, a spermatophore just discharged\r\nshowing its gelatinous base with a projecting spike which bears a tuft of\r\nspermatozoa, × 2. (After Jordan.)]\r\n\r\n_T. viridescens_ is common throughout the Northern and Eastern parts of the\r\nUnited States. Large females are about 11 cm. long, the males 1 cm. less.\r\nThe general colour above is brown, with a tinge of green; on each side of\r\nthe trunk, with a row of bright vermilion spots; the under parts are\r\norange, studded with small black dots. Half-grown specimens are brownish\r\nred, with the same lateral red spots as the adult. According to Jordan,[61]\r\nthis voracious species lives chiefly on the larvae of insects, on small\r\nmolluscs such as _Cyclas_ and _Planorbis_, on earthworms and on small\r\nCrustacea. It is eminently aquatic in the adult stage. The eggs are laid\r\nfrom April to June, the period lasting for one individual four to six\r\nweeks, or even longer. One female laid 108 eggs in all from 20th April to\r\n30th May. After having selected a suitable plant, for instance an\r\n_Anacharis_ or a bunch of _Fontinalis_ leaflets, she bestrides the plant\r\nand gathers in the surrounding shoots with her hind-limbs, {129}pressing\r\nthe leaves closely around the cloaca. She next turns on her side, or\r\noccasionally on her back; with fore-limbs outstretched and rigid, with\r\nhind-limbs and leaves completely hiding the cloaca, she remains perfectly\r\nmotionless for six to eight minutes. Then she slowly leaves the \"nest,\"\r\nwhich now holds an egg well protected by a tangle of shoots glued together\r\nby the gelatinous secretion poured out of the cloaca. Jordan concludes,\r\nfrom the fact that he never found spermatozoa in the oviducts, that the\r\neggs are fertilised just before they are expelled, when passing the\r\nreceptaculum seminis.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphosed young pass their life on land under stones and logs as\r\nthe so-called red variety, which is merely a stage in the life-history of\r\nthe species. It seems to take them several years to reach maturity, and to\r\nbecome again typically aquatic. Young, red individuals which I have myself\r\nkept, have behaved for more than a year like the young of other newts,\r\nspending their time under moss and bark without going into the water.\r\n\r\nThe change from the red-spotted stage has been exhaustively studied by\r\nGage.[62] He remarks that this species is very common near Ithaca, in an\r\nupland forest and along the head-waters of the Susquehannah. The\r\ntransformation takes place either in the autumn or in the spring, either\r\nwhile the newt is still on land, or after entering the water.\r\n\r\nOf two which were kept in a jar with moist wood, one was especially\r\nbrilliant, but within two weeks it assumed, in the middle of September, the\r\ncharacteristic coloration of the viridescent form. The two specimens were\r\nin the jar until the following July, when they were placed where they could\r\nenter the water. This they did with great readiness, and they remained\r\nsubmerged for a considerable time at first. The time under water increased\r\nin length, until within two or three days the pharyngeal respiration under\r\nwater was fully established. On the other hand, viridescent specimens never\r\nreassume the red garb when kept out of the water.\r\n\r\nRed specimens entering the water in the spring, changed into the greenish\r\nform within a few weeks, and established the pharyngeal respiration, losing\r\nthe ciliated oral epithelium. Branchiate larvae and the adult aquatic forms\r\nhave non-ciliated {130}epithelium, and the cilia are re-established when a\r\ngreen specimen is forced again to live on land. Ciliation always exists in\r\nthe red stage, and in the green stage before the newt has taken to the\r\nwater. The cilia sweep towards the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe three following South European species belong to the _Euproctus_ group,\r\nso called on account of the mostly conical, backward directed, and vividly\r\ncoloured vent.\r\n\r\n_T. asper_ s. _pyrenaeus_.–The Pyrenean newt has hitherto been found only\r\nin the Pyrenees, for instance in Lac Bleu and Lac d'Oncet, which latter\r\nlies about 7000 feet above the level of the sea. According to Bedriaga,[63]\r\nit prefers lakes which are supplied during the whole summer with water from\r\nglaciers. It is very sluggish, only moving to breathe and when in search of\r\nfood, which consists of worms and insects. The general colour is greenish\r\nbrown, dark above; the under side of the head and body are bright orange\r\nred in the female, yellow in the male; dark spots separate this bright\r\ncolour from the flanks. The tail has a narrow ventral stripe of bright red\r\nand yellow. The cloaca of the female is bright red, that of the male dull\r\ngrey. The total length amounts to about 4 inches or 10 cm.\r\n\r\nThe pairing time is the end of June, or later in cold seasons. The male\r\ngets hold of the female by forming a noose with its tail round her; it lies\r\nunderneath, the cloacae being pressed together so that the spermatozoa can\r\nbe taken in directly. The larvae have large yellow-green spots on the back\r\nand sides, and a bright red ventral tail-fin; when metamorphosed the\r\ngreenish spots become more confluent on the back, producing a broad spinal\r\nband. Larvae which live in deep water are dark, while those in sunny places\r\nare light-coloured and spotted with yellow.\r\n\r\n_T. montanus_ in Corsica and _T. rusconii_ in Sardinia are allied forms,\r\nbut the males are distinguished by a spur-like process or dilatation at the\r\nend of the fibula.\r\n\r\n_T. waltli_, the Iberian Newt, is olive-brown above, yellowish with\r\nblackish markings below. The tail has a yellow or orange ventral line.\r\nThere is no crest. A remarkable peculiarity of this species (which it\r\nshares only with _Tylototriton andersoni_ of the Loo-Choo Islands) is its\r\nribs, which are very long, sharply pointed, and frequently perforate the\r\nskin. Before {131}perforation the point of the rib lies in a lymphatic\r\nspace. This surprising feature has by many authorities been considered as\r\nabnormal or pathological. Certainly young, and even many adult, individuals\r\nare found in which the skin is not perforated, but when these are handled\r\nthe wriggling motions of this strong newt force the points of the ribs\r\nthrough the skin, and they remain sticking out to the extent of several\r\nmillimetres. The wounds heal up, the skin forming a neatly finished-off\r\nhole through which the spike projects, not as a formidable, but as a\r\nsufficiently awkward, protective weapon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.–_Triton waltli._ Spanish Newt, adult and larvae. ×\r\n⅔.]\r\n\r\nLarge females reach a length of 10 inches. The larvae metamorphose, as a\r\nrule, when they are between 2 and 3 inches long, but those which have been\r\nbred in tanks often reach double this length. These newts are frequent\r\ninhabitants of the rain-water cisterns common in the South of Portugal and\r\nSpain, into which they tumble without ever being able to get out again.\r\nThis species spends most of its time in the water, {132}preferring ponds,\r\namong the vegetation of which they can be watched lying motionless, with\r\ntheir limbs hanging down and with the head close to the surface; but they\r\nare lively during the night. When their ponds dry up they leave them,\r\ncrawling into the most unexpected places, to aestivate under rocks, or even\r\nin the walls of old buildings, where they are found by accident only. The\r\nrange extends from Central Spain and Portugal into Morocco.\r\n\r\n_Tylototriton verrucosus_ lives in the Eastern Himalayas and in the\r\nmountains of Yunnan. The skin is tubercular, with large parotoids; above\r\nuniform black-brown, pale below; the tail has a ventral yellow or orange\r\nline. Total length about 6 inches. _T. andersoni_ of the Loo-Choo Islands\r\nis remarkable for the pointed ribs which perforate the skin.\r\n\r\n_Pachytriton brevipes_, discovered in Kiansi, Southern China, has a smooth\r\nskin, olive-brown above, with many black dots; the under parts are\r\nyellowish, dotted with black. Total length about 7 inches.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. PROTEIDAE.–The three pairs of fringed external gills persist\r\nthroughout life. Both fore- and hind-limbs are present. The eyes are devoid\r\nof lids. The maxillaries are absent. Teeth are present on the\r\npremaxillaries, on the vomers, and on the mandible. The vertebrae are\r\namphicoelous.\r\n\r\nThis family consists of only three genera, with one species in each.\r\n\r\n_Necturus maculatus_ s. _Menobranchus lateralis_.–The eyes are functional,\r\nbeing covered by the thin transparent skin. The limbs, although short, are\r\nwell developed, and have four fingers and four toes. The whole animal,\r\nwhich reaches the length of one foot, is quite smooth and slimy, brown with\r\nirregular dark, blackish spots and patches, which frequently form a dark\r\nlateral band extending from the mouth to the tail. The latter, which\r\nmeasures about one-third of the whole length, is strongly compressed,\r\ncarries a thick dorsal and ventral fin, and is rounded off at the end. The\r\nskin of the throat forms a strongly-marked transverse fold. The thick\r\nstalks of the gills are brown, while the numerous and delicate fringes are\r\ndark red in life; beneath and behind them are two gill-clefts. _N.\r\nmaculatus_ is found in the eastern half of the United States, chiefly the\r\neastern part of the basin of the Mississippi and the Canadian lakes.\r\n\r\n{133}These creatures are rather dull; they remain mostly at the bottom of\r\nthe water, more or less concealed in the weeds or between rocks during the\r\ndaytime. Mine, which are kept in a roomy, light-coloured tank, lie\r\nmotionless, with their gills spread out transversely. Every now and then\r\nthe gills contract suddenly and become pale, whereupon they are filled\r\nagain with blood. Very rarely they rise to the surface, but tiny\r\nair-bubbles are let out more frequently, especially when the animals are\r\ndisturbed. Then the gills collapse, are laid flat against the neck, and the\r\ncreature darts about with quick, eel-like motions. At night they leave\r\ntheir hiding-places, swim about or creep along the ground with slow,\r\nundulating movements, the limbs being scarcely used, in search of food,\r\nwhich in their wild state consists of rather large Crustacea, small fishes,\r\nworms, insects and frogs. They are most voracious, and absolutely\r\nindifferent to cold. The spawning takes place in the months of April and\r\nMay.\r\n\r\n_Proteus anguinus._–The fore- and hind-limbs are fully developed, but\r\npossess only three fingers and two toes. The eyes are completely hidden\r\nbeneath the opaque skin. This peculiar creature is restricted to the\r\nsubterranean waters of Carniola, Carinthia, and Dalmatia. The vast caves of\r\nAdelsberg not far from Trieste are especially celebrated for the occurrence\r\nof the \"Olm,\" the German name of this animal. The river Poik, a moderate\r\nmountain-stream, but a large, fierce torrent during the rainy season,\r\ndisappears into the limestone-hills, and rushes through enormous\r\nstalactite-grottoes, most of which have been only partially explored, until\r\nseveral miles farther on it reappears on the surface. There, deep down\r\nbelow the surface, in absolute darkness, in an almost constant temperature\r\nof about 50° F. is the home of _Proteus_.\r\n\r\nTheir total length is scarcely one foot. The whole body is white,\r\noccasionally suffused with a slight fleshy, rosy tinge, while the three\r\npairs of gill-bunches are carmine-red. They are easily kept in captivity,\r\nand live for many years, provided three conditions are strictly adhered to,\r\nviz. fresh and clean water, an equable low temperature of about 50° F. =\r\n10° C. and darkness. The question of food is not so very important, since\r\nspecimens are known to have existed for years, although they refused to\r\ntake any nourishment. How far darkness is an {134}absolute necessity is not\r\nknown. Anyhow, the white skin is almost as susceptible to light as is a\r\nphotographic plate. If light is not absolutely excluded the white skin\r\nbecomes in time cloudy, with grey patches, and if kept exposed to stronger\r\nlight, the whole animal turns ultimately jet-black. Mr. Bles has succeeded\r\nin producing several totally black specimens, having kept them for several\r\nmonths in a white basin under ordinary conditions of light. No experiments\r\nhave yet been made to find out if the black pigment deposited is lost again\r\nin darkness. Those which are kept in a tank in an absolutely dark cellar of\r\nthe Cambridge Museum, with permanent water-supply, are doing very well.\r\nWhen approached with a candle they become restless or remain partly hidden\r\nin all sorts of seemingly most uncomfortable attitudes, squeezed in between\r\nthe sharp-edged tiles and drain-pipes with which their lodgings are\r\nfurnished. But the introduction of a wriggling worm, a little crustacean or\r\nother live bait draws them from their hiding-places, and, guided by the\r\nmotions of the prey in the water, possibly also by the sense of smell, they\r\nsnap it up and devour it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.–_Proteus anguinus._ × ⅔. Front view of the mouth in\r\nthe left upper corner.]\r\n\r\nIf the water is not sufficiently well aerated, they rise to the surface,\r\nemit a bubble of air, and take a new supply into their lungs. As a rule\r\nthey remain motionless under water, but the gills contract spasmodically\r\nand become paler, whereupon they fill again with blood and darken; the\r\ncontrast between the pure white body and the carmine-red feathery gills is\r\nvery beautiful.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the mode of propagation was quite unknown. Several\r\n_Proteus_, kept by E. Zeller, laid, in the middle of April, {135}a number\r\nof eggs which were then fastened singly on to the under side of projecting\r\nstones in the water. The pale yellow yolk measured 4 mm. in diameter and\r\nwas surrounded by a cover of 1 mm. in thickness, besides an outer\r\ngelatinous mantle, so that the whole egg measured about 11 mm. The larvae\r\nwere hatched after 90 days; they were 22 mm. long, and already much like\r\nthe adult, except that the fin was not restricted to the tail, but extended\r\nover the last quarter of the trunk, and that their eyes were still visible.\r\nThe fore-limbs were already typical in shape, but the hind-limbs were still\r\ntoe-less little stumps.[64]\r\n\r\n_Typhlomolge rathbuni._–It is of the greatest interest that a subterranean\r\nPerennibranchiate newt, in many respects closely resembling _Proteus_, has\r\nrecently been discovered in Texas. There can be no doubt that similar\r\nconditions of life have produced these two forms from _Necturus_- and\r\n_Spelerpes_-like ancestors,[65] one in Europe, the other in North America,\r\nabsolutely independently of each other. The limbs of _Typhlomolge_ are long\r\nand very slender, the four fingers and five toes are thin, free and\r\npointed. The head is large, the mouth square. The eyes are completely\r\nhidden and the whole animal is colourless and white. The tail is furnished\r\nwith a dorsal and a ventral fin. The very deep gular fold is nothing but\r\nthe pair of united but large opercular flaps. The three pairs of gills are\r\nremarkable for their blade-like stalks, while the gill-lamellae proper are\r\nshort and restricted to the tapering ends. Total length about 75 mm., of\r\nwhich the head measures 15, the tail 32 mm.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar creature inhabits subterranean caves in Texas, to judge from\r\nthe fact that all the specimens hitherto known have come up with the water\r\nof an artesian well 188 feet deep, near San Marcos. According to\r\nBlackford,[66] \"the legs are used for locomotion and the animals creep\r\nalong the bottom of the aquarium with a peculiar movement, swinging the\r\nlegs in irregular circles at each step. They climb easily over the rocks\r\npiled in the aquarium, and hide in the crevices between them. All efforts\r\nto induce them to eat have been futile, as has also been the case with\r\nblind cave-fish in captivity, and they are {136}either capable of long\r\nfasts or live on infusoria in the water.\" It seems more reasonable to\r\nsuppose that these newts live upon Crustacea, four kinds of which, all new\r\nto science, also came up with the water.\r\n\r\nFAM. 4. SIRENIDAE.–The three pairs of fringed external gills persist\r\nthroughout life. The body is eel-like. Hind-limbs are altogether absent,\r\nwhile the fore-limbs are short and have three or four fingers. The\r\nmaxillary bones are absent. With the exception of small teeth on the vomer\r\nthe mouth is toothless, but the jaws are furnished with horny sheaths. The\r\neyes are devoid of lids, but shine through the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.–_Siren lacertina._ × ½.]\r\n\r\nThe Sirenidae are the most degraded members of the Urodela and are\r\nrepresented by two closely-allied genera, each with one species, in the\r\nsouth-eastern parts of the United States. Their most interesting feature,\r\nwhich bears upon the question of neoteny, is their retrograde metamorphosis\r\nas described by Cope.[67] The gills atrophy in the young and are\r\nsubsequently redeveloped. Cope therefrom concludes rightly that the\r\nultimate or persistent gills of _Siren_ are signs of maturity and not a\r\nlarval character. In young specimens of _Siren_ of 5 to 6 inches in length\r\nthe gills are functionless; in one of 3 inches they were found to be\r\nentirely vestigial and \"subepidermal,\" _i.e._ covered by a common dermal\r\ninvestment. Unfortunately really young larvae are still unknown. Old Sirens\r\ncan live without gills, as has been shown by aquarium-specimens. In the\r\nadult _Pseudobranchus_ all the gills are normally covered up by an\r\ninvestment of the skin so as to be quite without function and movability.\r\n\r\n_Siren lacertina_, the \"mud-eel,\" is distinguished by the {137}possession\r\nof three pairs of gill-clefts and by its four fingers. It reaches a length\r\nof 70 cm., or about 2½ feet, of which about one-third is taken up by the\r\ntail, which is strongly compressed and finned. The skin is smooth, mostly\r\nblackish, lighter below, sometimes with whitish specks all over the body.\r\nThis creature is frequently found in ditches and ponds, where it burrows in\r\nthe mud. When swimming the limbs are folded back. They are said sometimes\r\nto leave the water and to crawl about on the moist ground.\r\n\r\n_Pseudobranchus striatus_ has only one pair of gill-clefts and only three\r\nfingers. The slightly granular skin is dusky brown above, with a broad\r\nyellow band on either side and with a paler, narrower stripe below. Total\r\nlength about 7 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{138}CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nLISSAMPHIBIA (_CONTINUED_)–ANURA\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER III. ANURA OR TAILLESS AMPHIBIA.\r\n\r\nThe recent tailless Amphibia, or Frogs and Toads in the widest sense,\r\ncontain such a great number of species (about 900), with such a diversity\r\nof characters, that it is necessary, if only for the sake of mere\r\nconvenience, to group them into a considerable number of families and\r\nsub-families. The characters available for this purpose are few.\r\n\r\n  1. The possession of a tongue characterises the PHANEROGLOSSA, the\r\n  absence of a tongue the AGLOSSA.\r\n\r\n  2. The character of the shoulder-girdle.–Overlapping of the two halves of\r\n  the shoulder-girdle on the ventral side characterises the ARCIFERA, while\r\n  in the FIRMISTERNIA the two ventral halves meet in the middle line and\r\n  form a firm, median bar. See, for details, p. 24.\r\n\r\n  3. The shape of the transverse processes or diapophyses of the sacral\r\n  vertebra which carries the iliac or hip-bones. These processes are either\r\n  _dilated_ or _cylindrical_.\r\n\r\n  4. The presence or absence of teeth in the upper and lower jaws. This is\r\n  indicated by a formula in which 0 means absence of teeth; max. means\r\n  presence of teeth in the upper jaw; mand. means presence of teeth in the\r\n  lower jaw.\r\n\r\n  5. The terminal joints or phalanges of the fingers and toes are sometimes\r\n  _claw-shaped_. See p. 26.\r\n\r\n  6. The shape of the centra of the vertebrae.–_Opisthocoelous_, if the\r\n  posterior end is cup-shaped or concave, _procoelous_ if the anterior end\r\n  is concave and the posterior is convex. See p. 19.\r\n\r\nBy means of these characters we can arrange the Anura in the following\r\nkey:–\r\n\r\n  I. Aglossa.

Ecaudata,\"\r\nrecognises that the pectoral arch is of greater systematic value than the\r\ndentition. The latter is used, together with the shape of the sacral\r\ndiapophyses, for the separation into families.\r\n\r\n  I. Phaneroglossa. _A_. Firmisternia.      {  1.

Pipidae.\r\n\r\n{141}This emendation of the Arcifera and Firmisternia was accepted by Cope\r\nin his synopsis of the families of Vertebrata (_Amer. Natural._ xxiii.,\r\n1890), except that he still retained his suborder Gastrechmia.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of Boulenger's great work a number of forms have been\r\ndiscovered which, from the characters of their dentition, have necessitated\r\nthe establishment of certain new families, namely, Ceratobatrachidae and\r\nGenyophrynidae; and Boulenger was the first to recognise that the taxonomic\r\nvalue of the mere presence or absence of teeth in the jaws had been\r\noverestimated. I therefore propose using it as a character distinctive of\r\nthe sub-families only, thereby reducing the number of families, relying\r\nfirst (leaving the Aglossa aside) upon the firmisternal or arciferous\r\ncondition of the pectoral arch, secondly upon the dilated or cylindrical\r\nshape of the sacral diapophyses, thirdly upon the dentition. Blindly\r\nconsistent application of these principles would reduce the Phaneroglossa\r\nto four families only, namely Ranidae, Engystomatidae, Cystignathidae and a\r\nfourth family comprising all the Arcifera with dilated sacral diapophyses.\r\nThis would obviously be wrong. We have therefore to resort to other\r\nadditional characters or rather peculiarities. The opisthocoelous character\r\nof the vertebrae and the possession of distinct ribs, together with the\r\ndisc-shaped tongue, separate the Discoglossidae and justify their retention\r\nas a family. The Hylidae are marked off by the claw-shaped terminal\r\nphalanges, but the remaining forms, comprising the Bufonidae and\r\nPelobatidae, cannot be separated except by their dentition, and I plead\r\nguilty of inconsistency in retaining them as separate families.\r\n\r\nAfter all, our classification may not represent the natural system, and it\r\nmay be nothing but a convenient key.\r\n\r\nWhen we have eliminated the characters of the vertebrae, the dentition, the\r\nclaw-shaped phalanges and the adhesive discs, it may well be asked what\r\ncharacters remain. The firmisternal is a further, higher modification of\r\nthe older, more primitive arciferous condition. The difference between the\r\ndilated and cylindrical shape of the sacral diapophyses is in not a few\r\ncases very slight, and there are various, most suggestive exceptions. The\r\npresence or absence, size and shape of the omosternum and metasternum are\r\nof very limited taxonomic value, not always applicable to all {142}the\r\nmembers of the same family. The fact is, that the Anura are a very recent\r\nand a most adaptive, plastic group. The earliest known fossils are scarcely\r\nolder than the Middle Eocene.\r\n\r\nAlmost every one of the greater families has produced terrestrial,\r\narboreal, aquatic, and burrowing forms. Their habits have modified, and are\r\nstill shaping their various organs, first of course those by which the\r\nanimals come first and most directly into contact with their surroundings\r\n(_e.g._ adhesive discs, dentition, general shape of the body, length of\r\nlimbs, wartiness of the skin, tympanic disc). These are the so-called\r\nadaptive characters, sometimes decried as merely physiological; as if\r\nhabits, use, and requirements did not likewise influence and ultimately\r\nmodel every other organ (_e.g._ tympanic cavity, Eustachian tubes,\r\nvertebrae, ribs, coccyx, pectoral arch, etc.). There are true Toads,\r\nBufonidae, which are as smooth, wartless, slender-bodied and long-legged as\r\nthe most typical of \"Frogs\"; true Ranidae, like _Rhacophorus_, which by\r\ntheir green colour, large adhesive discs and arboreal habits may well put\r\nmany of the Hylidæ to shame. _Ceratohyla_ has developed the claw-shaped\r\nterminal phalanges which are otherwise typical of, and peculiar to, the\r\nHylidae, but this genus reveals itself by various details as a close\r\nrelation of the other Hemiphractinae; and these fall in with the\r\nCystignathidae on the strength of their cylindrical, not dilated, sacral\r\ndiapophyses.\r\n\r\nIn sketching the phylogenetic tree of the families of the Anura we have to\r\nproceed with great caution.\r\n\r\nThere is not much doubt about the Aglossa. They have retained some of the\r\nmost primitive characters, but have by now been so much modified and\r\nspecialised that they are to be looked upon as an early side-branch.\r\n\r\nAmong the Phaneroglossa the Discoglossidae are with certainty the oldest,\r\nbut are now scarce in genera and species, and much specialised. The\r\nPelobatidae connect them with the Bufonidae. The Cystignathidae form a\r\nrather ill-defined assembly which points downwards to the Pelobatidae,\r\nupwards to the Hylidae. There is no divergence of opinion about the Ranidae\r\nbeing the highest of all the Anura, and amongst them the Raninae the most\r\ntypical, the Dendrobatinae the most specialised. If we assume that\r\nmoderately dilated sacral diapophyses represent a more primitive stage than\r\ncylindrical processes, we shall {143}naturally look to the Engystomatidae\r\nas the connecting link between the Ranidae and the Arcifera, through\r\nBufonoid creatures still with teeth in both jaws. If, on the other hand, we\r\ntake the dilatation to be a further development from more or less\r\ncylindrical processes, then the Ranidae can be considered as having sprung\r\nfrom Cystignathoid creatures, which have consolidated their pectoral arch\r\ninto the firmisternal condition; and in this case the Firmisternia would\r\nnot be a natural group, the Engystomatidae pointing, to the Bufonoid stock.\r\nThis would, to a great extent, mean a reversion to Cope's idea.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 1. AGLOSSA.–The two diagnostic peculiarities of the few members\r\nof this group are: first, the absence of a tongue; secondly, the union of\r\nthe Eustachian tubes into one median pharyngeal opening in the posterior\r\nportion of the palate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.–Map showing distribution of Aglossa. _Hymenochirus_\r\nto be added in Equatorial Africa.]\r\n\r\nThe pharyngeal opening and the tubes themselves are wide, the tympanic\r\ncavities are present, but the tympanic discs are not distinct from the rest\r\nof the skin. The fronto-parietal bones are fused into one mass, a rare\r\nfeature in the Anura. The nasals are large. _Pipa_ and _Hymenochirus_ have\r\nno teeth, _Xenopus_ has teeth on the upper jaw. The vertebrae are\r\nopisthocoelous and typically epichordal in their development; the second,\r\nthird, and fourth carry long ribs, which in old specimens fuse with the\r\nsupporting diapophyses. The sacral diapophyses are enormously dilated, and\r\nthe sacrum is fused with the os coccygeum. The serial number of the sacral\r\nvertebrae exhibits a most interesting gradation. In _Xenopus_ the ilium is\r\ncarried by the diapophyses of the 9th, in _Pipa_ the 9th and 8th, in\r\n_Hymenochirus_ the 7th and 6th. In these cases the two diapophyses of each\r\nside are fused together into a single broad blade, and their original\r\nduplicity is indicated only by the {144}holes for the spinal nerves.\r\n_Hymenochirus_ has consequently only 5 presacral vertebrae, the vertebral\r\ncolumn being shortened to the greatest extent known amongst Vertebrata. For\r\nfurther information see p. 22. The ilia are much broadened vertically, and\r\nare firmly attached to the sacrum. The shoulder-girdle is sometimes\r\ndescribed as of the arciferous type, but this is quite unjustifiable. The\r\nepicoracoid cartilages do not overlap each other, but meet, and partly fuse\r\nin the middle line. The three genera exhibit some differences. In _Pipa_\r\nand _Hymenochirus_ the bony portions of the coracoids are much expanded\r\ndorsally, and there is a considerable amount of epicoracoid cartilage, that\r\nof the precoracoid bars extending backwards as a broad-based and blunt\r\nomosternum. _Xenopus_ is devoid of an omosternum, and the configuration of\r\nthe whole apparatus is more slender. The metasternum of _Xenopus_ and\r\n_Hymenochirus_ broadens out laterally. _Hymenochirus_ greatly resembles\r\n_Breviceps_, a genus of Engystomatinae, in the relative position and size\r\nof the various parts of the shoulder-girdle and sternum.\r\n\r\nThe tibio-fibula of _Hymenochirus_ has a wing-like expansion of thin bone\r\non each side, forming a deep groove on the outer aspect. The astragalus and\r\ncalcaneum are united by a similar bony expansion with wing-like\r\nprojections.\r\n\r\nThe lungs are remarkable for the prominent development of trabecular\r\nprojections and niches, so that their free lumen is much restricted; they\r\nhave thereby reached a much higher stage than in any other Amphibia or even\r\nmany Autosauri. The persistence of an arteria sacralis s. caudalis, a\r\nvessel absolutely absent in the adult _Rana_, is a primitive feature, and\r\nthe same applies to the presence of a true first spinal or suboccipital\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the back and belly is supplied by two great branches from the\r\narteria anonyma, one arising proximally, the other distally from the\r\nsubclavian; herewith is correlated the almost complete absence of the\r\narteria cutanea magna, which as a branch of the ductus pulmo-cutaneus plays\r\nsuch a prominent rôle in the other Anura. Only in _Pipa_, but not in\r\n_Xenopus_, is the great cutaneous vein represented by a very small branch.\r\nBoth these genera possess a much more complicated \"diaphragm\" than the\r\nother Anura, chiefly owing to a special muscle which arises {145}from the\r\nanterior end of the ilia and spreads out fan-like to the oesophagus and to\r\nthe bases of the lungs.[71] This diaphragmatic arrangement is correlated\r\nwith the great development of the lungs, and is not a primitive but an\r\nadvanced feature. It is reasonable to suppose that this has caused the\r\nreduction of the usual arteria pulmo-cutanea, and that the other two\r\ncutaneous arteries have been developed secondarily. The Aglossa are\r\ngenerally considered as the lowest Anura, and only Cope looked upon _Pipa_\r\nand _Xenopus_ as two convergent terminal branches. Beddard came to the\r\nconclusion that both are closely related to each other, chiefly on account\r\nof their peculiar diaphragmatic arrangement. The whole question has entered\r\nupon a new stage since the recent discovery of _Hymenochirus_, which is in\r\nmany ways intermediate between the two other genera. Moreover, the\r\nmid-Tertiary _Palaeobatrachus_ of Europe is undoubtedly related to them,\r\nand we conclude now that all these four genera belong to one group with a\r\ndistribution formerly much wider than Africa and part of South America. But\r\nthis does not necessarily mean that the Aglossa are in all respects the\r\nmost primitive group of living Anura. On the contrary, they possess few\r\ndecidedly primitive characters, namely, the long typical ribs, the presence\r\nof the first spinal nerve, the unimportant persistence of the arteria\r\nsacralis, and lastly, the possession in the tadpoles of a right and left\r\nopercular \"spiracle.\" The absence of the tongue cannot possibly be an\r\narchaic feature, considering its universal presence in all the other\r\nAmphibia, including the Apoda, and the suggestive circumstance that this\r\norgan is least developed in the entirely aquatic members of the Urodela. In\r\nfact, thoroughly aquatic creatures, which seize and swallow their prey\r\nunder water, require no elaborate tongue; and since we know that the Anura\r\nmust owe their typical formation to terrestrial life, it follows that those\r\nwhich have again taken to the water and are tongueless, have lost this\r\norgan. As I have shown elsewhere,[72] the epichordal development of the\r\nvertebrae is likewise a secondary feature, far from primitive; and the\r\ntendency of the shortening of the vertebral column, which has reached its\r\nextreme in _Hymenochirus_, points to the same conclusion. The apparatus of\r\nthe shoulder-girdle and sternum is in the last transitional stage from the\r\nformer arciferous to the typically consolidated firmisternal {146}type. In\r\nfact there is little left which is primitive, but much that is very\r\nspecialised and highly developed in the Aglossa, mostly in adaptation to\r\ntheir absolutely aquatic life, to which they must however have taken very\r\nearly. They are in a position somewhat analogous to the Ratitae among\r\nBirds, which are likewise an old group, although many of their most\r\nstriking features have been acquired secondarily.\r\n\r\n_Xenopus_ s. _Dactylethra_. The upper jaw is furnished with teeth. The ilia\r\nare attached to the ninth vertebra. The pupil is round. The terminal\r\nphalanges are pointed. The fingers are free, the toes broadly webbed, and\r\nthe first three are covered with sharply pointed, horny, black-brown nails,\r\na feature which is alluded to by the alternative generic names. A cutaneous\r\ntentacle projects from below the eye and naturally invites comparison with\r\nthe tentacle of the Apoda and of Urodela. The skin is smooth, rich in\r\nmucous glands, besides certain tube-like apparatuses, possibly sensory,\r\nwhich are scattered over the body, especially on the head, and form a\r\nconspicuous series of white dots along the dorso-lateral line, from the eye\r\nto the vent. The general colour of the upper parts is olive brown, mottled\r\ndarker, while the under parts are whitish. The female has three cutaneous\r\nflaps closing the vent. The male develops black nuptial brushes along the\r\ninner side of the fingers. There are several species, all African\r\n(Ethiopian).\r\n\r\n_X. laevis_, ranging from the Cape to Abyssinia, is distinguished by the\r\nabsence of a metatarsal spur. The tentacle is very short. Size about 3\r\ninches. _X. muelleri_ of Zanzibar and Benguella, is smaller. The tentacle\r\nis conspicuous, as long as the diameter of the eye. The inner metatarsal\r\ntubercle carries a sharp claw. _X. calcaratus_ of tropical West Africa is\r\nonly 2 inches long, and has strong metatarsal claws, short tentacles and\r\nvery minute eyes.\r\n\r\nThe habits and oviposition of the \"Clawed Toad\" have been described by\r\nLeslie.[73] The Boers call it \"Plathander,\" _i.e._ flat hand. Entirely\r\naquatic, it rests floating in the water, with the nostrils exposed, and\r\nleaves the water only if it has to change the locality on account of\r\ndrought or scarcity of food. The pairing takes place, at least at Port\r\nElizabeth, in the early spring, _i.e._ in the month of August. The only\r\nsound which is emitted is heard during this time, a very slight and dull\r\ntick-tick, audible at only a few feet distance. The male grasps the female\r\nby the loins; the eggs are extruded singly, measuring only 1.5 mm. in\r\ndiameter, but swell to double that size. They are attached singly to stones\r\nor water-plants.\r\n\r\n{147}[Illustration: FIG. 29.–_Xenopus laevis._ Clawed Toad, adult and\r\nlarvae, × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n{148}Latterly these creatures have frequently been brought over to England.\r\nThey stand confinement very well, even in a little aquarium with sufficient\r\nwater-weeds to keep the water fresh; and they do not require special heat.\r\nThey greedily snap up worms, strips of liver, or meat, and poke the food in\r\nwith their hands. A few kept by Boulenger in a glass jar have lived for the\r\nlast eleven years in the ordinary temperature of a room in London.\r\nCuriously enough they are often in amorous embrace, regardless of the\r\nseason, but they have never shown any signs of spawning.\r\n\r\nSome of those in the Zoological Gardens in London laid eggs on Saturday the\r\n27th of May, and on the morning of the following Monday the larvae were\r\nalready hatched. They have been described by Beddard.[74] The larvae are\r\nprovided with an unpaired circular, ventral sucker. The tentacles begin to\r\nsprout out on the sixth day after hatching, at first not in connexion with\r\nthe cranial cartilage, but soon a cartilaginous rod runs into the tentacle\r\nfrom the ethmoid \"just above the joint with the under jaw.\". Boulenger has\r\nmost reasonably compared these organs with the \"balancers\" of _Triton_ and\r\n_Amitystoma_ (cf. p. 46 for the possible homologies of the balancers). The\r\ntentacles soon reach a great length and give the tadpole a curious\r\nappearance. In tadpoles of _X. calcaratus_, 65 mm. long, the tentacles are\r\n30 mm. long, and are inserted just at the angle of the mouth. By the time\r\nthat these tadpoles show their fore-limbs, the feelers are reduced to 4 mm.\r\nin length, and their relative position has been shifted to a little above\r\nthe angle of the gape, and whilst the latter gradually extends further and\r\nfurther back, the feelers come to lie, or rather remain, below and a little\r\nin front of the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe tadpoles have no traces of horny teeth. External gills project as low\r\nconical or lamellar processes from the first three branchial arches, but\r\nso-called internal gills are not developed.\r\n\r\nAmongst a number of Clawed Toads imported in the spring one female became\r\nswollen with eggs, but as they did not show signs of wanting to breed, a\r\npair was put into the tropical tank {149}in the Cambridge Botanic Gardens,\r\na transfer which had the desired effect. Eggs were laid, and more during\r\nthe following nights; they hatched out within thirty hours. The whole brood\r\nwas lost, before any of them were older than a few days, since they were\r\nattacked, beyond the possibility of a cure, by a _Saprolegnia_ or some\r\nsimilar pest.\r\n\r\n_Hymenochirus_, represented by one species, _H. boettgeri_, has been\r\ndiscovered in the Ituri, German East Africa, and in the French Congo, and\r\nhas no doubt a much wider distribution. It is scarcely 1½ inch long, and is\r\neasily recognised by the toothless mouth, the half-webbed fingers (hence\r\nthe generic name), the incompletely webbed toes, the third of which is\r\nlonger than the fourth, and the absence of sensory muciferous canals in the\r\nskin. The three inner toes are, as in _Xenopus_, furnished with small black\r\nclaws. The skin is rough, beset with small granular tubercles. The general\r\ncolour above and below is olive-brown. The vent is, as in _Xenopus_,\r\nproduced into a spout or semi-canal, but is devoid of dorsal flaps of skin.\r\n\r\n_Pipa._–This Neotropical member of the Aglossa is quite toothless, but the\r\njaws of the adult have horny substitutes. The only species is _P.\r\namericana_, the famous Surinam Toad, chiefly known from the Guianas, but\r\nundoubtedly extending much further, having recently been reported from the\r\nneighbourhood of Pará.\r\n\r\nThe general shape of this creature is very peculiar. The head is much\r\ndepressed and triangular; the eyes are very small; the skin forms several\r\nshort, irregularly-shaped flaps and tentacles on the upper lips and in\r\nfront of the eye, and at the angle of the mouth. The tympanum is invisible.\r\nThe pupil is round. The fingers are very slender and free, ending in\r\nstar-shaped tips; the toes are broadly webbed. The whole skin is covered\r\nwith small tubercles and is dark brown above, while the under parts of the\r\nvery flat and depressed body are whitish, sometimes with a dark brown\r\nstripe along the middle line. In the female the skin of the back forms\r\ngrowths for the reception of the eggs, and in these the young undergo their\r\nwhole metamorphosis.\r\n\r\n{150}[Illustration: FIG. 30.–_Pipa americana._ Surinam Toad. × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n{151}The most characteristic feature of the skin,[75] which has exactly the\r\nsame structure in both sexes, is the papillae, which are spread over the\r\nwhole surface, except on the webs of the toes, on the cornea and on the\r\nstar-shaped points of the fingers. Each papilla carries a little horny\r\nspike, and a poison-gland frequently opens near its base. Larger\r\npoison-glands exist on the dorsal and ventral side in four rows, and\r\nsmaller glands open upon the sides of the body, but there are no parotoid\r\ncomplexes. Slime-glands occur all over the surface. The epidermis consists\r\nof the usual layers, namely the Malpighian, the stratum corneum, and the\r\npart which is shed periodically. The latter is completely horny, appearing\r\nto be structureless like a cuticle, but it is in reality composed of\r\npolygonal cells with flattened nuclei; each little spike is one modified\r\nhorny cell. The whole outermost layer contains black-brown pigment. The\r\nupper portion of the cutis is devoid of pigment, then follows a layer of\r\nclusters of ramified dark pigment-cells, and lastly the rest of the cutis.\r\n\r\nEach of the four fingers ends in a four-armed star, the tips of which again\r\ncarry four or five sensory papillae. The cartilage of the terminal\r\nphalanges is correspondingly star-shaped.\r\n\r\nAccording to Klinckowstroem these toads, which are entirely aquatic, are\r\neasily collected at the end of the long dry period, when they are all\r\nconfined to the half-dried-up pools. But they do not spawn there. This\r\nhappens after the rains have inundated the forest, and then it is very\r\ndifficult to get the females with eggs on their backs. Each of the eggs,\r\nwhen once they have been glued on to the back, sinks into an invagination\r\nof the skin. The initial stages are probably the same as those caused by\r\nthe eggs on the belly of _Rhacophorus reticulatus_ (see p. 248). Later,\r\neach egg is quite concealed in a cavity with a lid. These cavities are\r\nsimply pouches of the skin, and are not formed by enlarged glands as has\r\nbeen suggested by some anatomists. Each cavity consists of the epidermal\r\npouch and the lid. How the latter is produced is not known. According to\r\nthe authors quoted above, the lid looks like a shiny or sticky layer which\r\nhas hardened into horn-like consistency. It lies exactly like a lid upon\r\nthe rim of the pouch itself, and is certainly not in structural or organic\r\ncontinuity with the epidermis. Most probably it is produced by the remnant\r\nof the egg-shell itself, which, after the larva is hatched, is cast up to\r\nand remains on the top of the cup.\r\n\r\n{152}Bartlett[76] has described the spawning of specimens in the Zoological\r\nGardens in London.\r\n\r\n\"About the 28th of April 1896 the males became very lively, and were\r\nconstantly heard uttering their most remarkable metallic, ticking\r\ncall-notes. On examination we then observed two of the males clasping\r\ntightly round the lower part of the bodies of the females, the hind parts\r\nof the males extending beyond those of the females. On the following\r\nmorning the keeper arrived in time to witness the mode in which the eggs\r\nwere deposited. The oviduct of the female protruded from her body more than\r\nan inch in length, and the bladder-like protrusion being retroverted,\r\npassed under the belly of the male on to her own back. The male appeared to\r\npress tightly upon this protruded bag and to squeeze it from side to side,\r\napparently pressing the eggs forward one by one on to the back of the\r\nfemale. By this movement the eggs were spread with nearly uniform\r\nsmoothness over the whole surface of the back of the female to which they\r\nbecame firmly adherent. On the operation being completed, the males left\r\ntheir places on the females, and the enlarged and projected oviduct\r\ngradually disappeared from one of the females. In the other specimen, the\r\noviduct appears not to have discharged the whole of the eggs.\"\r\n\r\nBoulenger, who examined this second specimen, which died, confirmed this\r\negg-bound condition. He remarks further: \"The ovipositor formed by the\r\ncloaca (not by the prolapsed uterus), was still protruding and much\r\ninflamed. It may be deduced from the observation made by the keeper, that\r\nfecundation must take place before the extrusion of the eggs, and it is\r\nprobable that the ovipositor serves in the first instance to collect the\r\nspermatozoa which would penetrate into the oviducts, the eggs being laid in\r\nthe impregnated condition, as in tailed Batrachians.\"\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 2. PHANEROGLOSSA–FAM. 1. DISCOGLOSSIDAE.–The tongue has the shape\r\nof a round disc, adherent by nearly the whole of its base, and it cannot be\r\nprotruded. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, and in the aquatic genera are\r\nof the most exaggerated epichordal type; the diapophyses of the second to\r\nthe fourth vertebrae carry short, free ribs, and those of the sacral\r\nvertebra are dilated. The metasternum behind is forked. The {153}upper jaw\r\nand the vomers are provided with teeth. The males have no vocal sac. The\r\ntadpoles are distinguished by having the opercular spiracle placed in the\r\nmiddle of the thoracic region (see general anatomical part, p. 44).\r\n\r\nThe few members of this family have a peculiar distribution. _Liopelma_ is\r\nconfined to New Zealand, where it is the solitary representative of the\r\nAmphibia. _Ascaphus_ is found in North America. The other genera,\r\n_Discoglossus_, _Bombinator_, and _Alytes_, are typical of the Palaearctic\r\nsub-region, and are, with the exception of _Bombinator_, confined to the\r\nWestern Provinces (cf. Map, Fig. 32, on p. 161).\r\n\r\n_Discoglossus._–The tympanum is frequently more or less concealed by the\r\nskin. The pupil is round or triangular. The omosternum is small. The\r\nvertebrae are of the epichordal type.\r\n\r\n_D. pictus_, the only species, has a smooth and shiny skin, provided with\r\nnumerous small mucous glands. The palms of the hands are provided with\r\nthree tubercles, of which the innermost is the largest, and is carried by\r\nthe vestige of the thumb. The coloration of this species is very variable.\r\nThe ground-colour of the upper parts is a rich olive brown with darker,\r\nlight-edged patches, which are either separate or confluent in various\r\nways, forming broad, longitudinal bands, or a few larger asymmetrical\r\npatches, separated in some individuals by a broad and conspicuous light\r\nbrown or yellowish vertebral stripe. An irregular reddish band frequently\r\nextends from the eyes backwards along the sides. The under parts are mostly\r\nyellowish white. This variability is purely individual, the most\r\ndifferently marked and variously coloured specimens being found in the same\r\nlocality and even amongst the members of one and the same brood. The male\r\ndevelops various nuptial excrescences, consisting of minute, dark, horny\r\nspines, notably on the inner palmar pad, on the inner side of the first and\r\nsecond finger, on the chin and throat, and smaller and more scattered\r\nspicules on the belly and legs.\r\n\r\nThis pretty and extremely active little creature, which measures between 2\r\nand 3 inches in length, is confined to the south-western corner of the\r\nPalaearctic sub-region, being found in Algiers and Morocco, Sicily,\r\nSardinia, Corsica, and the southern and western parts of the Iberian\r\nPeninsula. Curiously {154}enough it is absent in the Balearic Isles. Rather\r\naquatic in its habits, frequenting pools and streams, it is also often\r\nfound on land.\r\n\r\nThe male has a feeble voice, which sounds like \"ha-a, ha-a-a,\" or\r\n\"wa-wa-wa,\" uttered in rapid succession. The pairing season lasts a long\r\ntime, in Algeria from January to October, but a much shorter time in the\r\nnorth of Portugal, where it extends over the spring and summer months.\r\nBoulenger has made extensive observations on many specimens kept in\r\ncaptivity. The embrace, which never lasts long, is lumbar. The eggs are\r\nsmall, 1 to 1.5 mm. in diameter, dark brown above and greyish below, each\r\nsurrounded by a gelatinous capsule of 3-7 mm. in diameter. The eggs are\r\nlaid singly, and a set amounts to from 300 to 1000, the whole mass sinking\r\nto the bottom of the pool. Each female lays several times during the\r\nseason. The eggs are developed very rapidly, the larvae escaping sometimes\r\nafter thirty-six hours, but usually from the second to the fourth day. The\r\nexternal gills are lost on the seventh day, when the tadpoles are 11 mm.\r\nlong; the hind-limbs appear on the tenth, and after four weeks the tadpoles\r\nreach their greatest length, namely from 25-30 mm. The fore-limbs appear on\r\nthe thirtieth day, and a few days later the most precocious specimens leave\r\nthe water and hop about. Others, however, of the same brood took from two\r\nto three months in metamorphosing.\r\n\r\nThis species lives on insects and worms, and can swallow its prey under\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Bombinator._–The tympanum is absent and the Eustachian tubes are very\r\nminute. The pupil is triangular. The omosternum is absent. The vertebrae\r\nare absolutely epichordal. The fingers are free, the toes are webbed. The\r\nupper parts are uniformly dark, and are covered with small porous warts.\r\nThe general shape of the head and body is depressed or flattened downwards.\r\nThe habits are eminently aquatic. This genus consists of three species, two\r\nof which are European, the third Chinese.\r\n\r\n_B. igneus._–The under parts are conspicuously coloured bluish black with\r\nlarge irregular red or orange-red patches; the upper parts are more or less\r\ndark grey or olive black. The iris is golden, speckled with brown. The male\r\nhas a pair of internal vocal sacs by which the throat can be inflated;\r\nnuptial excrescences are developed on the inner side of the fore-arm and\r\nthe {155}first two fingers. Total length from 1½ to 2 inches, the males\r\nbeing generally smaller than the females. This \"Fire-bellied toad,\" the\r\n\"Unke\" of the Germans, is essentially a native of lakes, ponds, and other\r\nstanding waters of the plains.\r\n\r\nIt ranges through the whole of North Germany, Bohemia, and Hungary into\r\nRussia, eastwards as far as the Volga. The latter river, the Danube, and\r\nthe Weser form, roughly speaking, its boundaries; northwards it extends\r\ninto Denmark and the southern extremity of Sweden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.–_Bombinator igneus._ × 1. Fire-bellied Toad. Two of\r\nthem in \"warning\" attitude.]\r\n\r\n_B. pachypus._–The under parts are yellow instead of red. The male is\r\ndevoid of vocal sacs, but has nuptial excrescences on the under surface of\r\nmost of the toes, in addition to those on the fore-arm and fingers. The\r\n\"Yellow-bellied Toad\" is the representative of the red-bellied species in\r\nSouthern and Western Europe, preferring, although not exclusively, the\r\nhilly and mountainous districts. It ranges from France and Belgium through\r\nSouth-Western Germany, continental Italy, and the whole of Austria and\r\nTurkey in Europe. Where both species meet, for instance in the hilly\r\ndistricts between the Weser and the Rhine, in Thuringia and in Austria, the\r\npredilection of the yellow-bellied {156}species for the hills, and that of\r\nthe other for the plains, is well marked.\r\n\r\nWhile _B. igneus_ prefers standing waters with plenty of vegetation, _B.\r\npachypus_ is often found in the smallest occasional puddles produced by\r\nrecent rain, for instance in the ruts of roads. Both species have otherwise\r\nmuch in common. They are essentially aquatic. They hang in the water, with\r\ntheir legs extended, nose and eyes just above the surface, and bask or lie\r\nin wait for passing insects, the fire-bellied kind preferring to conceal\r\nitself in the vegetation of the margins of ponds. During the pairing\r\nseason, in Germany in the month of May, they are very lively and perform\r\npeculiar concerts, one male beginning with a slowly repeated note like\r\n\"hoonk, hoonk,\" or \"ooh, ooh,\" in which all the other males soon join, so\r\nthat, when there are many, an almost continuous music is produced. This\r\nsound is not at all loud, a little mournful and very deceptive. It appears\r\nto be a long way off, certainly at the other end of the pond, until by\r\ncareful watching you see the little creature almost at your very feet. But\r\non the slightest disturbance the performance ceases, they dive below and\r\nhide at the bottom. The yellow-bellied kind, when surprised in a shallow\r\npuddle, skims over the mud, disturbs it, and allows it to settle upon its\r\nflat body, so that nothing but the little glittering eyes will betray its\r\nconcealment. When these toads are surprised on land, or roughly touched,\r\nthey assume a most peculiar attitude, as shown in Fig. 31. The head is\r\npartly thrown back, the limbs are turned upwards with their under surfaces\r\noutwards, and the whole body is curved up so that as much as possible of\r\nthe bright yellow or red markings of the under parts is exposed to view.\r\nThe creature remains in this strained position until all danger seems\r\npassed. In reality this is an exhibition of warning colours, to show the\r\nenemy what a dangerous animal he would have to deal with. The secretion of\r\nthe skin is very poisonous, and the fire-toads are thereby well protected.\r\nI know of no creature which will eat or even harm them. I have kept numbers\r\nin a large vivarium, together with various snakes, water-tortoises, and\r\ncrocodiles, but for years the little fire-bellies remained unmolested,\r\nalthough they shared a pond in which no other frog or newt could live\r\nwithout being eaten. Hungry water-tortoises stalk them under water, touch\r\nthe intended prey with the nose in order to {157}get the right scent, and\r\nthen they withdraw from the _Bombinator_, which has remained motionless,\r\nwell knowing that quick movements, or a show of escape, would most likely\r\ninduce the tortoise to a hasty snap, with consequences to be regretted by\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nAfter they have been handled frequently, they do not readily perform, but\r\nsimply lie still, or hop away. Miss Durham experienced considerable\r\ndifficulty in inducing her tame specimens to assume and to keep up the\r\ncorrect warning attitude. The statement that they \"turn over on the back\"\r\nis a fable, graphically fixed in various illustrated works.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that these two species are diurnal and thoroughly aquatic.\r\nThey are certainly active in the daytime, sing in full sunshine, and spend\r\nmost of their time in the water, but they display much more liveliness\r\ntowards the evening and during the night, especially when there is a moon.\r\nMy fire-toads live by no means always in the water, but conceal themselves\r\nin the daytime under stones, while they are regularly all astir at night in\r\nsearch of worms and all kinds of small insects.\r\n\r\nThe spawning takes place several times during the spring and summer. The\r\namplexus is lumbar, and the eggs are extruded singly. They sink to the\r\nbottom, or are attached to water-plants. The oviposition takes a long time,\r\nperhaps the whole night, and several dozen eggs, not hundreds as in the\r\nallied genera, make a set. The egg, with its swollen gelatinous capsule, is\r\nlarge for so small a creature, namely 7-8 mm. in diameter. The embryos\r\nescape after a week, and the tadpoles reach two inches in total length.\r\nThose of _B. igneus_ have a triangular mouth, but in _B. pachypus_ this is\r\nelliptical, as in _Alytes_ and _Discoglossus_. Metamorphosis is completed\r\nin the same autumn; the little toad is then about 15 mm. long, and differs\r\nfrom the adult by the absence of the conspicuous coloration of the under\r\nparts. In reasonable conformity herewith it does not take up the warning\r\nattitude. The colour appears gradually during the second year, but full\r\ngrowth is generally not reached until the third year. They do not hibernate\r\nin the water, but hide on land out of the reach of frost.\r\n\r\n_Alytes._–The tympanum is distinct, the pupil vertical, the omosternum is\r\nabsent. The only two species live in South-Western Europe. The male\r\nattaches the eggs to its hind limbs, and nurses them until they are\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\n{158}_A. obstetricans_, the \"Midwife-toad,\" has the general appearance of a\r\nsmooth toad. The upper parts are rather smooth, sometimes almost shiny, in\r\nspite of the numerous more or less prominent warts, of which those of the\r\nlateral lines, and those above the ear, are generally most marked. The\r\ncolour of the upper parts varies a great deal according to the prevalence\r\nof greenish and reddish spots upon the grey or brown ground-colour. The red\r\nis sometimes, especially in the breeding males, rather conspicuous on the\r\nparotoid region and on the upper sides of the body. The under parts are\r\nwhitish grey. The iris is pale golden, with black veins. The male has no\r\nvocal sac, and is as a rule smaller than the female, the latter reaching a\r\nlength of two inches.\r\n\r\nThis species occurs in the whole of the Iberian Peninsula and in France,\r\nextending into Switzerland and beyond the Rhine valley into Thuringia.\r\nAltitude above the sea does not seem to have any influence upon its range,\r\nwhich reaches from sea-level to the tops of subalpine mountains. I have\r\nfound great quantities of its tadpoles in Portugal on the Serra d'Estrella,\r\nnearly 6000 feet high, and they are recorded from 6500 feet in the\r\nPyrenees. They seem to be ubiquitous in Spain and Portugal, not that they\r\nare often found or seen, but they are heard everywhere; besides, tadpoles\r\nare sure to be in the clear cold lakes on the tops of the mountain-ranges,\r\nin the dirty puddles caused by the village fountains, and in the sun-heated\r\nswampy ditches on the roadside with scarcely enough water to hold the\r\nwriggling mass. Wherever there is water within easy reach, on the lonely\r\nmountains, in fertile valleys, in the gardens of the busy towns, you hear\r\nduring the whole night, from March to August, the double call-note of the\r\nmale, sounding like a little bell; but to see the performer is quite a\r\ndifferent matter. He sits in front of his hole, dug out by himself or\r\nappropriated from a mouse, in a crack of the bottom of a wall, under\r\nstones, or in a similar place into which he withdraws for the day.\r\n\r\nThe pairing and the peculiar mode of taking care of the eggs by the male,\r\nwhich habit has given it the specific name _obstetricans_, the midwife,\r\nhave been most carefully observed by A. de l'Isle du Dréneuf, near Nantes.\r\nA condensed account has been given by Boulenger. Several males collect\r\naround a female on land, not in the water, and the successful one grasps\r\n{159}her round the waist. For nearly half an hour the male lubricates the\r\ncloacal region of the female by more than one thousand strokes of his toes,\r\nwhereupon the female extends the hind-limbs, forming with the bent\r\nhind-limbs of the male a receptacle for the eggs, which are then expelled\r\nwith a sudden noise. The eggs are yellow and large, up to 5 mm. in\r\ndiameter, and are fastened together in two rosary-like strings, several\r\ndozen making one set. During the expulsion of the eggs the male shifts its\r\nbody forwards, clasps his fore-limbs round the female's head, and\r\nfecundates the eggs. After a rest he pushes first one hind-limb and then\r\nthe other through the convoluted mass of eggs, which then have the\r\nappearance of being wound round the hind-limbs in a figure of 8. Then the\r\nsexes separate and the male withdraws with its precious load into its hole,\r\nwhich it, however, leaves during the following nights, in search of food,\r\ntaking this opportunity to moisten the eggs in the dew, occasionally even\r\nimmersing them in the water. After at least three weeks, when the larvae\r\nare nearly ready, he betakes himself to the nearest water, and the larvae\r\nburst the thereby softened gelatinous cover of the eggs. Not infrequently\r\nthe same male ventures upon a second pairing, and adds another load to the\r\none which already hampers its movements. The eggs being large, owing to the\r\ngreat amount of yellow food-yolk, the embryos are enabled to be hatched in\r\na more advanced stage than in most other Anura. The larva develops only one\r\npair of external gills within the egg. These appear first in the shape of\r\noval bags upon the third branchial arch, which sprout out secondary\r\nbranches, soon in their turn to be resorbed and replaced by the so-called\r\ninternal gills before hatching.\r\n\r\nFischer-Sigwart[77] gives the following account of the growth of this\r\nspecies. The male took to the water, with its load of twenty to thirty\r\neggs, on the 6th of June. The larvae escaped out at once, 16-17 mm. long,\r\nthe body measuring 5 mm. On the 14th they had reached 32 mm. in length,\r\nwhereupon they grew very slowly, although they were well fed, in a\r\ntemperature of about 50° F. This same brood did not metamorphose until May\r\nof the next year. The growth took place as follows:–The hind-limbs appeared\r\non the 8th of September, when the tadpoles were 50 mm. long; by the middle\r\nof the next May they {160}had reached their greatest length, 76 mm., the\r\nhind-limbs being 18 mm. long, whilst the fore-legs were just indicated. On\r\nthe 21st of May the hind-limbs were 27 mm. long, and the whole creature was\r\npractically metamorphosed, except for the tail. The latter was resorbed on\r\nthe 13th of July, and the little toads, 25 mm. in length, were actually\r\nsmaller, certainly far less bulky and heavy, than the tadpoles, which had\r\nrequired one year and a quarter for their metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe early broods probably finish their development by the autumn of the\r\nsame year, but those which are born later, in July and August, certainly\r\nhibernate in the water. I have found very small tadpoles, scarcely 15 mm.\r\nlong, on the Cantabrian mountains as late as the end of September, and\r\nrather large ones in the spring at the time of first pairing; the fact that\r\nthis takes place during the whole summer explains the occurrence of\r\ntadpoles in all stages of development almost the whole year round.\r\n\r\n_A. cisternasi_ has only two palmar tubercles, the middle or third one of\r\n_A. obstetricans_ being absent; the outer finger is short and thick.\r\nInstead of a very long and wide fronto-parietal fontanelle, the\r\nfronto-parietal bones diverge only in front so that there are two\r\nfontanelles, a small one in the parietal and a large triangular one in the\r\nfrontal region. The limbs are relatively shorter and stouter in conformity\r\nwith the habits of this species, which prefers to burrow in sandy\r\nlocalities. Otherwise it leads the same kind of life as _A. obstetricans_,\r\nand the male carries the eggs. It has hitherto been found in Central Spain\r\nand in the middle provinces of Portugal.\r\n\r\n_Liopelma_ is intermediate between _Alytes_ and _Bombinator_, agreeing with\r\nthe latter, in conformity with its essentially aquatic life, in the absence\r\nof a tympanum, while the Eustachian tubes are entirely suppressed. The\r\ntongue is disc-shaped, but is slightly free behind. The pupil is\r\ntriangular. The male is devoid of a vocal sac. _L. hochstetteri_ is the\r\nsole representative of the Amphibia in New Zealand, where it is apparently\r\nrare. The upper parts are covered with smooth tubercles, and are dark brown\r\nwith blackish spots; the under parts are whitish. Total length only 1½\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. PELOBATIDAE.–The upper jaw and, as a rule, the vomers are provided\r\nwith teeth. The tongue is oval, slightly {161}nicked, and free behind, so\r\nthat it can be thrown out, except in _Asterophrys turpicola_ of New Guinea,\r\nwhich has a large but entirely adherent tongue. The vertebrae are\r\nprocoelous, except in _Asterophrys_ and the Malay genus _Megalophrys_,\r\nwhere they are opisthocoelous. The sacral diapophyses are strongly dilated.\r\nThe omosternum is small and cartilaginous. The metasternum has a bony\r\nstyle, and ends in a cartilaginous, rounded or heart-shaped disc, but in\r\n_Scaphiopus_ it forms an entirely cartilaginous plate. The tympanic disc is\r\nmostly hidden or indistinct, and is quite absent in _Pelobates_. The\r\nEustachian tubes are very small in _Pelobates_, and exceedingly minute in\r\n_Scaphiopus stagnalis_ of New Mexico. The pupil is vertical. This family\r\ncontains seven genera with about twenty species, with a rather scattered\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.–Map showing distribution of Cystignathidae,\r\nDiscoglossidae, and Pelobatidae.]\r\n\r\n  _A._ Toes extensively webbed, sacrum and coccyx confluent.\r\n\r\n    _a._ Metasternum a cartilaginous plate.

The inner tarsal tubercle is large, and is transformed into a\r\nshovel which is covered with a hard, sharp-edged, horny sheath. The skin of\r\nthe upper surface of the head is partly co-ossified with the underlying\r\ncranial bones, giving them a pitted appearance. The general shape is\r\ntoad-like.\r\n\r\n_P. fuscus._–The smooth skin is brown above, with darker marblings, while\r\nthe under parts are whitish, but the coloration varies greatly, from pale\r\nto dark brown or olive-grey with more or less prominent irregular dark,\r\nsometimes confluent, patches. Some specimens are adorned with numerous red\r\nspots. The tarsal spur is yellow or light brown. The iris is metallic red\r\nor golden. The male has a long oval gland on the upper surface of the upper\r\narm, and although possessed of a voice, has no vocal sacs. The total length\r\nof full-grown females is nearly 3 inches, that of males half an inch less.\r\n\r\nThe \"Spade-footed Toad,\" which occurs throughout the whole of Central\r\nEurope, extends from Belgium and the middle of France to North-Western\r\nPersia, and from the southern end of Sweden to Northern Italy. It prefers\r\nsandy localities, in order to dig its deep hole, in which it sits concealed\r\nduring the daytime. Owing to the looseness of the sand, the hole is filled\r\nup so that no trace of its inhabitant is left. The digging is done by means\r\nof the spades, and in suitable localities the animal soon vanishes, sinking\r\nbackwards out of sight. Except in the breeding season, or at night, it is\r\ntherefore found only accidentally. The sand-loving habits do not, however,\r\nprevent it from enjoying moist localities. Several which I have kept for\r\nyears dig themselves into the wettest moss in preference to the drier parts\r\nof their habitation. Being thoroughly nocturnal, they hunt after nightfall,\r\nthe food consisting of all sorts of insects and of worms. When captured\r\nthey utter a startling shrill cry, and their skin becomes covered with a\r\ndermal secretion which smells like garlic, a peculiarity which has given\r\nthem in Germany the name of \"Knoblauchskröte,\" \"garlic-toad.\" Although they\r\nbecome very tame, so that they no longer smell when handled, they can be\r\nmade ill-tempered by being pinched or otherwise teased, whereupon they take\r\nup a defiant attitude, and with open mouth continue to cry for several\r\nminutes. Some such scenes occur now and then, without {163}my interference,\r\nwith the specimens which share their abode with several species of\r\n_Amblystoma_ and _Spelerpes_; there are heard now and then sudden loud\r\nyells, like the squeak of a cat or the yapping of a little dog.\r\n\r\nIn the spring the Spade-footed Toads take to the water for about a week,\r\nand the male's call-note is an ever-repeated clucking sound, which can also\r\nbe produced under water, with the mouth shut, the air being shifted\r\nbackwards and forwards through the larynx. The male grasps his mate below\r\nthe waist; the eggs are combined into one thick string, which is about 18\r\ninches long, and is wound round and between the leaves and stalks of\r\nwater-plants. The eggs measure 2-2.5 mm., and are very numerous, a large\r\nstring containing several thousands. The larvae are hatched on the fifth or\r\nsixth day in a very unripe condition. They are only 4 mm. long, quite\r\nblack, and still devoid of gills and tail. They attach themselves to the\r\nempty gelatinous egg-membranes, which they possibly live upon. On the\r\nfollowing day the tail begins to grow; two days later fringed external\r\ngills sprout out and serve for about ten days, when they in turn give way\r\nto new, inner gills. The little tadpoles then leave their moorings and\r\nbecome independent. The hind-limbs appear in the ninth week, the fore-limbs\r\nin the twelfth. At the age of three months they begin to leave the water.\r\nThe most remarkable feature is the enormous size of the full-grown tadpole,\r\nthe body of which is as large as a pigeon's egg; the usual total length,\r\nincluding the tail, amounts to about 4 inches or 100 mm., but occasionally\r\nregular monsters are found. This was the case some thirty years ago, when\r\nthe Berlin Museum received a number of tadpoles, the largest of which\r\nmeasured nearly 7 inches. They were found in the month of December near\r\nBerlin, in a deep clay-pit with high, steep walls, so that the tadpoles\r\nwere prevented from leaving the water. Similarly hemmed-in broods probably\r\nhibernate in the water under the ice, and such instances have been\r\nrecorded. Normally they metamorphose into the much smaller toad within the\r\nsame year.\r\n\r\n_P. cultripes._–This is the Spade-foot of the whole of Spain and Portugal\r\nand of the southern and western parts of France. It is similar in habits to\r\n_P. fuscus_, from which it differs but slightly. The tarsal spur is black,\r\nand there is a parieto-squamosal bridge which completely roofs over the\r\ntemporal fossa {164}and closes the orbit behind.–Boulenger has discovered\r\nthe rare, individual occurrence of minute teeth on the parasphenoid and on\r\nthe pterygoids of this species. These teeth are unquestionably the last\r\nreminiscences of a condition almost entirely superseded in the recent\r\nAnura.\r\n\r\n_P. syriacus_ from Asia Minor and Syria agrees with _P. cultripes_ in the\r\ncranial configuration, but has the yellow or brown spur of _P. fuscus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.–_Pelobates cultripes_, Spade-foot Toad, × 1, and\r\nunder surface of left foot.]\r\n\r\n_Scaphiopus._–The Spade-foot of North America and Mexico differs slightly\r\nfrom those of Europe, chiefly by the presence of a more or less hidden\r\ntympanum and of a subgular vocal sac, and by the sternum, which forms an\r\nentirely cartilaginous plate without a special style. The close\r\nrelationship of these two genera is further indicated by the occurrence of\r\npeculiar large glandular complexes in some of the species, pectoral in _S.\r\nsolitarius_, tibial in _S. multiplicatus_ of Mexico. At the same time this\r\ngenus approaches _Pelodytes_.–About eight species are known, two of which\r\ninhabit the United States, the others Mexico.\r\n\r\n{165}_S. solitarius_ is the commonest species of the Southern States. It is\r\nbrown above, with darker patches; its total length is about 2 inches.\r\nAccording to Holbrook it excavates small holes half a foot deep, in which\r\nit resides, seizing upon such unwary insects as may enter its dwelling. It\r\nnever leaves the hole except in the evening or after long-continued rains.\r\nIt appears early in March, and soon pairs; as an instance of hardiness\r\nHolbrook mentions that he has met it whilst there was still snow on the\r\nground. When teased they assume a humble attitude, bending the head\r\ndownwards with their eyes shut, as illustrated by Boulenger.[78]\r\n\r\n_Pelodytes_ is, like the rest of the genera, devoid of the tarsal digging\r\nspur. The tympanic disc is rather indistinct; the male has a subgular sac.\r\nThe general appearance of the slender body with long hind-limbs and toes is\r\nfrog-like. Two species only are known, one in South-Western Europe, the\r\nother in the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n_P. punctatus._–The \"Mud-diver\" has the upper parts covered with small\r\nwarts, and is about 1½ inch in length. Its coloration is variable, and\r\nchanges much. One day it may appear greenish brown, the next day pale grey;\r\nin the daytime perhaps with many bright green spots, and in the evening\r\nspotless and unicoloured. The under parts are mostly white, sometimes with\r\na fleshy tinge. The male has a voice like \"kerr-kerr\" or \"creck-creck,\"\r\nuttered during the breeding season, which lasts from the end of February\r\nuntil May, according to the temperature and the more Southern or Northern\r\nlocality. Occasionally they breed a second time in the summer or autumn.\r\nThe male develops nuptial excrescences, chiefly three rough patches on the\r\ninner side of the fore-limbs or on the inner side of the first two fingers,\r\nwhile the belly and thighs are covered with small granules. In the mode of\r\ncopulation, the laying of the small and numerous eggs, the hatching of the\r\nlarvae in a tail- and gill-less condition, this genus closely resembles\r\n_Pelobates_; but the tadpoles never reach a colossal size, the usual length\r\nbeing 2 inches, and even this is comparatively large for so small a\r\nspecies. It inhabits the greater part of France, most of Portugal, and the\r\nsouthern half of Spain, avoiding, however, the central plateaux and the\r\nmountain-ranges. Its habits are essentially nocturnal, {166}living in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the water, into which it hops with a long jump in\r\norder to hide in the mud. Easily kept, it breeds regularly in captivity,\r\naccording to circumstances at almost any time of the year.\r\n\r\n_P. caucasicus_ has been discovered in the Caucasus at an altitude of 7000\r\nfeet. The remaining genera of this family contain only a few species each,\r\nand are restricted to South-Western Asia, the Malay and Papuan Islands. The\r\ncommonest is _Leptobrachium_, which ranges from the Himalayas to Borneo and\r\nJava. Pupil vertical. Vomerine teeth sometimes absent. Tongue roundish,\r\nvery slightly nicked behind. Tympanum indistinct. Omosternum small,\r\ncartilaginous. Male with internal vocal sacs. Tarsus with a roundish\r\ntubercle. Some of the species, e.g. _L. carinense_ from the Karen Hills,\r\nattain to a large size, namely, 6 inches; they seem to live on rats and\r\nmice, and one specimen contained a young squirrel.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. BUFONIDAE (Toads).–The formula:–no teeth in the upper and lower\r\njaws, vertebrae procoelous and without ribs, sacral diapophyses dilated,–is\r\nsufficiently diagnostic of this cosmopolitan family. The generally\r\nentertained notion that toads have a rather thick-set, short-limbed, warty\r\nappearance, does not apply to all the members of the family. The majority\r\nare quite terrestrial, many are burrowing, the Javanese _Nectes_ is\r\naquatic, the Afro-Indian _Nectophryne_ is arboreal, while the Australian\r\n_Myobatrachus_ and the Mexican _Rhinophrynus_ eat termites and are\r\ncorrespondingly modified; lastly, _Bufo jerboa_ is a slender, long-legged\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nTeeth are almost entirely absent, except in _Notaden_, which has teeth on\r\nthe vomers. The omosternum is mostly absent, except in _Engystomops_ and in\r\nsome species of _Bufo_, while in _Notaden_ it is merely vestigial. The\r\nmetasternum shows more variety. The tympanum is usually distinct, but\r\nvaries even within the same genus, being hidden beneath the skin or being\r\nentirely absent. The terminal phalanges are modified according to the\r\nhabits of the species, but they are never claw-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe Bufonidae are connected in various directions. The Neotropical\r\n_Engystomops_ greatly resembles the likewise Neotropical Cystignathoid\r\n_Paludicola_, and the Australian _Pseudophryne_ closely approaches the\r\nAustralian Cystignathoid _Crinia_. It is therefore all the more remarkable\r\nthat a similar approach, in another direction, namely, towards the\r\nFirmisternal family of the {167}Engystomatidae, is indicated by the Mexican\r\n_Rhinophrys_ and the Australian _Myobatrachus_. However, since there are no\r\ntrue Engystomatidae in Australia, although several genera occur in\r\nPapuasia, these cases may be instances of convergence without necessarily\r\nimplying relationship. An unmistakable line of connexion leads, according\r\nto Boulenger, to the Pelobatidae, the link being the Himalayan\r\n_Cophophryne_, with very strongly dilated sacral diapophyses, with a single\r\ncondylar articulation of the coccyx with the sacral vertebra (as in some\r\nIndo-Malayan Pelobatidae), while this articulation is bicondylar in all the\r\nother Bufonidae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.–Map showing distribution of Bufonidae. The vertical\r\nlines indicate the occurrence of Bufonidae, but not of _Bufo_.]\r\n\r\nThe whole family is divided into nine genera with more than a hundred\r\nspecies, of which only about fifteen do not belong to the genus _Bufo_. The\r\ndistribution of the family is well-nigh cosmopolitan, with the remarkable\r\nexception of Madagascar, Papuasia, and the small islands of the Pacific;\r\n_Bufo_ has been wrongly said to inhabit the Sandwich Islands. The greatest\r\nnumber of species, chiefly _Bufo_, occur in the Neotropical region, the\r\ngreatest number of genera in Central America, where _Bufo_ is rare, and in\r\nAustralia, where it is absent.\r\n\r\n  A.

It\r\ndiffers from _Paludicola_ chiefly by the absence of teeth, by the\r\nmoderately dilated sacral diapophyses and by the slightly swollen tips of\r\nthe fingers and toes, the end-phalanges of which are, in one species, _E.\r\npetersi_, T- or anchor-shaped The tympanic disc is either distinct or\r\nhidden. The males have a large subgular vocal sac. The generic name refers\r\nto the small head with a prominent snout. Three species are known from\r\nCentral America and Ecuador.\r\n\r\n_Pseudophryne_ appears to be another link with the Cystignathidae by its\r\nresemblance to the Australian genus _Crinia_, from which it differs by the\r\nabsence of teeth and by the absence of an omosternum. The sacral\r\ndiapophyses are but moderately dilated. The males have a flat oval gland on\r\nthe hinder side of the thighs, and they are provided with a subgular vocal\r\nsac. The 3 or 4 species of this genus which live in Australia, both East\r\nand West, are not unlike _Bombinator_ in their general shape, short limbs\r\nand coloration. The skin of _P. australis_ and _P. bibroni_ is covered with\r\nsmall smooth warts and is blackish brown, while the under parts are\r\nblackish with large yellow {169}patches. Total length little more than one\r\ninch. Concerning the breeding habits, see p. 223.\r\n\r\n_Nectophryne._–The sacral diapophyses are strongly dilated. _N. afra_,\r\nwithout a tympanum, but with fully-webbed digits and several broad,\r\ncushion-like or lamellar pads on the fingers and toes, inhabits the\r\nCameroons, _N. tuberculosa_ of Malabar, and _N. guentheri_ and _N. hosei_\r\nof Borneo, have a visible tympanum and the fingers are webbed at the base\r\nonly. These slender and long-legged species are most probably arboreal, as\r\nindicated by the broadened, but truncated, tips of their fingers and toes.\r\n_N. hosei_ is about 4 inches long, _N. misera_ is a little creature of only\r\n¾ inch in length. _Nectes_, hitherto known by one species, _N. subasper_ of\r\nJava, is a swimmer and exceeds 6 inches in length. The tympanum is very\r\ndistinct; the small nostrils look upwards. The toes are long and webbed to\r\nthe tips; the hind-limbs are very long. The sacral diapophyses are strongly\r\ndilated. The skin of the upper parts is very rugose, covered with round\r\nwarts, and dark brown; the under parts are granular and uniformly light\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\n_Bufo._–The great number of species, more than 100, renders a strict\r\ndefinition of this genus difficult. The tongue is pear-shaped, thicker in\r\nfront, entire, not cut out, but free behind, so that it can be projected.\r\nThe fingers are free, the toes more or less webbed although never\r\ncompletely so. The terminal phalanges are obtuse and sometimes carry tiny\r\ndiscs. The omosternum is absent or merely vestigial. The metasternum is a\r\nrather large cartilaginous plate with a waist, which is sometimes\r\nincompletely calcified. The sacral diapophyses are moderately dilated. The\r\ntympanum is distinct or hidden. The skin of the upper parts is always rich\r\nin specific poison-glands, a concentration of which forms in many species\r\nvery conspicuous, thickened parotoid glands. The surface of the skin may be\r\nsmooth, moist and slimy, or rough and warty, sometimes covered with tiny,\r\nsharp, horny spikes and quite dry.\r\n\r\nThe genus is cosmopolitan, with the exception of the whole Australian\r\nregion and Madagascar, from which we may perhaps conclude that its original\r\ncentre was not in Notogaea, in spite of the diversity of species in the\r\nNeotropical region, which now contains about half of all the species known.\r\nNext to Central America the Indian region is richest in species of _Bufo_.\r\n\r\n{170}_B. vulgaris._–The Common Toad of the Palaearctic region. The skin of\r\nthe upper parts is much wrinkled and beset with numerous round warts or\r\npoison-glands, the openings of which can be seen with the naked eye,\r\nespecially on the large parotoid complexes. The outermost layer of the\r\nepiderm, in fact all that portion which is periodically shed, is elevated\r\ninto numerous little cornified spines. The extent of their development\r\nvaries much; southern specimens, especially those from Portugal, being\r\nperhaps the roughest. Others appear quite smooth to the touch, and this is\r\nthe case with many English specimens. The skin of the under parts is more\r\ngranular and devoid of specific glands. The general colour of the upper\r\nparts is olive grey to dark brown, more or less mottled; the under parts\r\nare whitish, often with a brown, yellow or reddish tinge.\r\n\r\nThe coloration of this species varies considerably and is moreover very\r\nchangeable. These changes depend chiefly upon the surroundings and the\r\nlocality, in which certain styles of coloration seem to be the fashion, not\r\nnecessarily to the absolute exclusion of others. Some specimens are of a\r\nrich brown colour, with or without dark brown spots and patches, and these\r\nare sometimes confluent, forming irregular, longitudinal bands. The\r\nground-colour of other individuals is olive grey, with or without darker\r\npatches, and these paler tones prevail in toads which live on\r\nlight-coloured soil, for instance on chalk. I recently found one between\r\ntwo dark-coloured slates, and this creature was so black that it gave the\r\nimpression of having soiled itself with coal-dust. One and the same\r\nspecimen will appear paler or darker according to its mood and the leading\r\ntones of its immediate surroundings, but it cannot change its dominant\r\nground-colour. A third colour-variety occurs more frequently in the\r\nmountainous districts of Southern Europe. I have obtained the most handsome\r\nspecimens in the Serra Gerez, in North Portugal. Their ground-colour is\r\npale brownish-yellow, with many large and small, rich brown patches, or if\r\nthe latter colour predominates, these patches and spots are separated from\r\neach other by creamy seams, with the occasional effect of dark brown,\r\nyellow-ringed eyes. Eastern Asiatic specimens often have a fine yellow\r\nvertebral line and the under parts are inclined to be marked with dark\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nThe iris is red or coppery, mottled with black. The male {171}has no vocal\r\nsacs, and, besides being smaller than the female, is distinguished by\r\nslight nuptial excrescences in the shape of little horny brushes on the\r\ninside of the inner palmar tubercle and the three inner fingers. The full\r\nsize of this toad varies extremely. Taking the standard of everyday\r\nexperience in England and Central Europe, one would call any female beyond\r\n3½ inches in length, and any male of more than 2½ inches, unusually large.\r\nBut occasionally they grow to a much larger size, especially in the\r\nmountains of Southern Europe, provided there is a rich vegetation of\r\nmeadows and deciduous trees so as to insure a variety of plentiful food.\r\nAlthough Fatio[79] mentions a toad 153 mm. = 6 inches long, and Boulenger\r\nsucceeded in getting a toad from Paris which measured 132 mm., _i.e._\r\nalmost 5¼ inches, one of my specimens from the Serra Gerez seems to hold\r\nthe record with a total length from snout to vent of 135 mm. or more than\r\n5¼ inches. Jersey is also famous for its large toads, possibly on account\r\nof the many large greenhouses. These large specimens do not constitute a\r\nspecial race. The monsters among them are without exception females, often\r\nbut not always sterile, as I have often found large masses of eggs in them.\r\nFood is the chief cause. At least I have observed that the more voracious\r\nof some Spanish and Portuguese specimens, which were already 3½ inches\r\nlong, and therefore entitled to respect, continued to grow rather rapidly,\r\nadding about half an inch within a year. Again, if the growth of a\r\npromising toad is arrested for a season–not necessarily by starvation, but\r\nby uncongenial surroundings, sameness, and unvaried nature of food–they\r\nconsolidate so to say, or settle down, and no amount of future good feeding\r\nwill turn them into exceptionally big specimens. There are no data to tell\r\nhow old such monsters really are. At least ten years are required by the\r\nSoutherners to reach four inches. The usual length of life attained by a\r\ntoad is likewise unknown. Boulenger kept one in a box provided with a sod,\r\na pan of water and plenty of varied food, but twelve years of close\r\ncaptivity did not make any appreciable difference in its appearance.\r\n\r\n{172}[Illustration: FIG. 35.–_Bufo vulgaris._ Portuguese specimen. × ⅔.]\r\n\r\nA number of large Spanish and Portuguese specimens in my greenhouse were at\r\nfirst very shy, and tried every possible means of escape or sullen hiding,\r\nbut gradually they condescended to take food when lifted on to the\r\nslate-covered stage upon which their food was spread. After a few weeks\r\nthey had learned this so thoroughly that, towards the usual hour of\r\nfeeding, they climbed most laboriously on to the slates, lying in wait\r\nbetween the flower-pots, and coming forward when we entered the house. The\r\nrest of the day and night they spent on the ground, under stones or plants,\r\neach in its individual lair. The biggest of all, and several others, became\r\nso tame that they took food whilst sitting on the hand, and then they\r\nlooked up for more. The food must be alive and show movement. Mealworms,\r\nsnails, beetles and other small creatures are first carefully inspected\r\nwith bent-down head, and are sometimes followed for a few inches; then\r\ncomes an audible snap, a flash of the rosy tongue and the prey has\r\ndisappeared. Large earthworms are nipped up with the jaws and laboriously\r\npoked in with the hands, the fingers being so placed as to clean the worm\r\nof adherent soil and other impurities. Very large worms are shaken,\r\ntwisted, pressed against the ground and gulped down with convulsive\r\nmovements, but not unfrequently the tip-end remains for some minutes\r\nsticking out of the tightly shut mouth. Several are taken at one sitting,\r\nuntil the toad is gorged. One of the biggest took full-grown mice, which\r\n{173}were not \"fascinated by the fiery eyes\" but were stalked into a corner\r\nand then pounced upon immediately when they moved. The shells of snails can\r\nfor half a day be felt through the body; they then dissolve or are\r\ndisgorged. The dung, which is passed in large, long masses, is often full\r\nof fine earthy matter, the contents of the earthworm's intestines, and\r\nsometimes it contains the chitinous remains of certain beetles which are\r\nsupposed to be excessively rare. I know of no instance of slugs being\r\neaten.\r\n\r\nThe regular hunting-time begins with the evening and is continued\r\nthroughout bright nights, the toads crawling and hopping about. They are\r\nexpert climbers of rocks, and succeed in reaching apparently inaccessible\r\nplaces by shoving themselves up between vertical walls, and taking\r\nadvantage of any roughnesses for foothold. Every few weeks they shed their\r\nskins. Without any preliminary symptoms or loss of appetite or liveliness,\r\nthe body makes a few twisting motions, the back is now and then curved, and\r\nthe skin splits down the middle line. Owing to the more forcible\r\ncontortions of the body it slides down to the right and left of the back,\r\nwhereupon the toad gets hold of the peeling-off skin with fingers and toes,\r\nscraping the head and sides, and conveys the thin, transparent, slightly\r\ntinged skin into the mouth, slips out of it backwards and swallows it. The\r\nnew surface is then quite wet and shiny, but it soon dries and hardens.\r\n\r\nMany toads, for instance the Common Toad and the Pantherine Toad, assume a\r\npeculiar attitude when surprised. Instead of blowing themselves up by\r\nfilling their lungs with air, they raise themselves upon their four limbs\r\nas high as possible, but turning the back towards the enemy in a slanting\r\nposition, either to the right or to the left side, apparently in order to\r\npresent as much surface as possible, in other words to look their biggest.\r\n\r\nSome of my specimens hibernated regularly for a few months, burying\r\nthemselves completely in loose, dry soil, under leaves, or,–a favourite\r\nplace,–in a heap of cocoa-nut fibre. Others, and this applies also to\r\nEnglish specimens transferred from the garden into the greenhouse, are\r\nlively all the year round, but even they withdraw for an occasional sleep\r\nof a few weeks at any time of the year.\r\n\r\nThe whole family of large toads came to a sad end after four years, when\r\nthey were put into new temporary quarters, a {174}slate-bottomed terrarium.\r\nBeing kept during my absence in wringing wet moss, which became fouled by\r\ntheir own excretions, they contracted a mysterious disease from which they\r\nnever recovered. They are rather averse to wet surroundings, and except\r\nduring the short pairing season they live in cool, shady places, preferably\r\nwith just a little dampness. Occasionally they take a soaking bath. One\r\nspecimen, living in the garden, repaired during the hot and dry summer\r\nnights to a standpipe in the garden, enjoying the occasional drips of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nConsidering the amount of snails and other noxious creatures destroyed by\r\nthem during their regular nocturnal hunts, toads are eminently useful\r\ncreatures. Nevertheless, they suffer much through the stupid superstition\r\nof people who ought to know better. It is difficult to find a gentle,\r\nabsolutely harmless and useful creature that is more maligned than the\r\nEuropean toad. It brings ill-luck to the house, the \"slimy toad\" spits\r\nvenom, sucks the cows' udders and after that destroys their power of giving\r\nmilk; it poisons the milk in the cellar, and a certain builder's horse,\r\nwhich was grazing in the grounds of the Cambridge Museums, and died there\r\nfrom a large concrement obstructing its bowels, was solemnly declared to\r\nhave swallowed one of my toads. Silly superstitions, owing to faulty, or\r\nrather entire want of, observation! The toad is not slimy, but dry; it is\r\noften found in buildings, where it keeps down the woodlice; it cannot suck,\r\nnor does it drink at all; it does not spit venom, but becomes covered with\r\nmilky white and very strong poison when in acute agony, for instance when\r\ntrodden upon; and unless the big skin-glands be forcibly squeezed, there\r\nwill be no squirting. Therefore, leave it alone, or put down food on its\r\nevening beat, and it will soon come to know and to recognise its friends.\r\n\r\nThe Common Toad can exist without food for a long time, provided the\r\nlocality is cool and damp, but it wastes away almost to skin and bones. In\r\norder to disprove the persistently cropping up fable and sensational\r\nnewspaper-accounts of toads having been discovered immured in buildings,\r\nwhere they were supposed to have lived for many years, Frank Buckland put a\r\ndozen specimens into separate holes bored in a block of porous limestone,\r\ncovered them up tightly with a glass plate and buried the block a yard deep\r\nin the soil. A second dozen were treated similarly, but were put into a\r\nblock of dense sandstone. After a {175}year and two weeks all the toads\r\nenclosed in the latter block were of course found dead and decomposed, but\r\nmost of those in the porous block were still alive, with their eyes open,\r\nand did not succumb to starvation until eighteen months of confinement.\r\nThese poor creatures could of course not move about, and were practically\r\nundergoing enforced continuous hibernation. Otherwise they would soon have\r\nwasted away and have died within six months. Those which tumble into deep\r\nand dry wells remain rather small, but generally manage to keep alive for\r\nyears on the spiders, woodlice, earwigs and other insects which likewise\r\ntumble in.\r\n\r\nToads hibernate far from the water in dry holes or clefts, retiring in the\r\nmiddle of October in Central Europe, and they do not reappear before March.\r\nSoon after, and this depends naturally upon the season, they congregate in\r\nponds or pools, and the males, which far outnumber the females, for whom\r\nthey fight, make a peculiar little noise, something like the whining bleat\r\nof a lamb, uttering this sound day and night. The male having, after much\r\nwrestling with competitors, secured a female, which is often several times\r\nbigger than himself, clasps her tightly, by pressing his fists into the\r\narmpits, and the pair swim or crawl about in this position sometimes for a\r\nweek before the spawning takes place. The number of eggs laid at one\r\nsitting is enormous, varying from 2000 to 7000. They are very small, only\r\n1.5-2.0 mm. in diameter, and are expelled in two double rows or strings,\r\none coming out of each oviduct. These strings consist of a soft gelatinous\r\nmass, in which the double rows of entirely black eggs are imbedded, and\r\nthey measure in the swollen condition about 6 mm. or ¼ inch in diameter,\r\nand from 10 to 15 feet in length. The strings are wound round and between\r\nwater-plants by the parents, which move about during the laying and\r\nfertilising process. According to the coldness or warmth of the season the\r\nlarvae are hatched in about a fortnight, and for the next few days they\r\nhang on to the dissolving gelatinous mass of the egg-strings. They then\r\nleave the slime and fasten themselves by means of their suckers to the\r\nunder side of grasses and water-plants or sticks, with their tails hanging\r\ndownwards, still in a rudimentary condition, but henceforth progressing\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nFischer-Sigwart[80] found the time of development as follows:–The {176}eggs\r\nwere laid on the 6th of March; the larvae left the jelly on the 16th, being\r\n4 mm. long. On the 2nd of April they measured 13 mm.; on the 25th, 20 mm.\r\nOn the 7th of May the hind-limbs appeared. On the 18th of May the tadpoles\r\nhad reached their greatest length, namely 24 mm., and this is a rather\r\nsmall size for so large a species. The fore-limbs broke through on the\r\n28th, and the metamorphosis was completed eighty-five days after the eggs\r\nwere laid, the creatures leaving the water on the 30th of May. The tadpoles\r\nshowed a preference for rotten pieces of _Agaricus_, which were floating in\r\nthe water. The little baby-toads are surprisingly small, scarcely 15 mm.\r\nlong, and live in the grass, under stones, in cracks of the ground, and hop\r\nabout in much better style than their heavier and more clumsy-looking\r\nparents. Where many broods have been hatched they can be met with in\r\nmyriads, the ground literally swarming with them, and as they are naturally\r\nstirred up by a sudden warm rain, perhaps after a drought, people will\r\noccasionally state it as an observed and well-ascertained fact that \"it has\r\nrained toads.\"\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of all these hopeful little creatures? Although it takes them\r\nfully five years to reach maturity, one would expect that the whole country\r\nwould be swarming with toads; but since this is not the case, there being\r\nnot more toads now than there were before, it follows that their enormous\r\nfecundity is only just sufficient to keep the race going. Adult toads seem\r\nto have scarcely any enemies except the Grass Snake, which takes them in\r\ndefault of anything better. But how about the reduction where there are no\r\nsnakes? We know nothing about epidemics which might carry them off, but\r\nelderly toads are liable to a horrible disease produced by various kinds of\r\nflies, notably by _Lucilia bufonivora_ and _Calliphora silvatica_, the\r\nmaggots of which somehow or other eat their way from the nostrils into the\r\nbrain and into the eyes. Those which reach the brain at first produce\r\neffects similar to those of _Coenurus cerebralis_, the hydatid or\r\nbladder-worm of sheep. The toad inclines its head towards one side, and\r\ncannot crawl straight, but walks in a circle. By eating away the brain they\r\ngradually destroy the host's life. But if none enter the brain, and a few\r\nonly find their way into the eye, they only impair or destroy its sight.\r\nSuch toads show signs of pain, poking at or stroking the affected eye,\r\nwhich becomes {177}inflamed, and ultimately remains enlarged, with the iris\r\npartially or entirely destroyed by the maggot, which does not develop\r\nfurther, but dies in the eye-chamber, this being really an unsuitable place\r\nfor it. The eyesight is of course affected, and is mostly, but not in all\r\ncases, lost. Such half-blind individuals–the disease affecting sometimes\r\none eye only–recover their health, and except for a little awkwardness,\r\nbehave like normal specimens. This applies to _Bufo vulgaris_ as well as to\r\n_B. calamita_. Australian Anura are cursed with a fly of their own, called\r\n_Batrachomyia_.[81]\r\n\r\n_B. vulgaris_ inhabits almost the whole of the Palaearctic region;–the\r\nwhole of Europe, with the exception of Ireland, the Balearic Islands,\r\nSardinia and Corsica. Northwards it extends to Trondhjem, and thence along\r\na line drawn across Russia and Siberia to the Amoor. Its southern limit in\r\nAsia is indicated by a line drawn from the Caucasus through the Himalayas\r\ninto China. In Asia Minor and in Persia it is absent. South of the\r\nMediterranean it occurs only in Morocco and Algeria.\r\n\r\n_B. melanostictus_ is the common toad of the whole Indian region and of the\r\nMalay Archipelago. The epidermis of the fingers and toes is thicker and\r\nmore cornified than usual, and is stained black brown, hence its specific\r\nname. The male has a subgular vocal sac. In other respects the Indian\r\nspecies much resembles the more spinous or rough-skinned and brown\r\nvarieties of the European species. According to S. S. Flower this toad is\r\nvery common in the Straits Settlements, hiding by day under stones or logs,\r\nor in holes, coming out shortly before sunset, and remaining abroad till\r\ndawn; it may be met with on the roads and in the grass, hopping or crawling\r\nabout in search of ants, bees, and similar food. It utters a rather feeble,\r\nplaintive cry when handled for the first time. It can change its colour\r\nfrom light yellowish to dark brown. The spawn, which resembles that of _B.\r\nvulgaris_, may be seen in March and April in ponds, in long strings twined\r\nabout the water-weeds. The tadpoles are very like those of the common\r\nEnglish toad in form, size, colour, and structure of mouth. The largest\r\nadult found in Penang measured 115 mm. (about 4 inches) from snout to vent.\r\n\r\n{178}_B. lentiginosus_ s. _americanus_ is the common toad of North America,\r\nfrom Mexico to the Great Bear Lake. It is worth noting that this species\r\nresembles in its coloration the Eastern races of _B. vulgaris_, in so far\r\nas they generally have a light vertebral line, and frequently dark spots on\r\nthe under surface. The upper parts are brown and olive, with darker spots,\r\ntwo of which form a chevron behind the eyes. But the tympanum is large, and\r\nthe male has a subgular vocal sac; the inner metatarsal tubercle is very\r\nlarge, and is used as a kind of digging spur. During the pairing time they\r\ntake to the pools in great numbers, uttering their music, which consists of\r\na prolonged trill, continued by different individuals, both day and night.\r\nHolbrook knew an individual which was kept for a long time, and became\r\nperfectly tame. During the summer months it retired to a corner of the room\r\ninto a habitation which it had prepared for itself in a small quantity of\r\nearth placed there for its convenience. Towards the evening it wandered\r\nabout in search of food. Some water having been squeezed from a sponge upon\r\nits head one hot day in July, it returned the next day to the spot, and\r\nseemed well pleased with the repetition, nor did it fail during the extreme\r\nheat of the summer to repair to it frequently in search of its shower-bath.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of this widely distributed species, whose average length\r\nis 2½ inches, have been described. The prettiest was called _B. quercinus_\r\nby Holbrook–according to whom it is mostly found in sandy places covered\r\nwith a small species of oak–which springs up abundantly where pine-forests\r\nhave been destroyed. It is called the \"oak-frog,\" as it spends most of its\r\ntime in concealment under fallen oak-leaves, or partially buried in the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n_B. marinus_ s. _agua_ is the giant among toads, and is one of the\r\ncommonest species of the Neotropical region, ranging from the Antilles and\r\nMexico to Argentina. It frequently reaches a length of 6 inches, with a\r\nwidth of 4 inches when squatting down in its favourite attitude. The upper\r\nparts are rough, owing to the prominent warty glands, of which the parotoid\r\ncomplex is enormous. The general colour above is dark brown, with sooty\r\ndark patches; below whitish, often with blackish patches. This creature\r\nappears at dusk, often in large numbers, especially during the rainy\r\nseason, hopping about, not crawling, with surprising {179}activity. The\r\nvoice of the male, strengthened by a subgular sac, is said to be a kind of\r\nloud snoring bark. The pairing time begins, according to Hensel,[82] with\r\nthe winter rainy season, especially June, and lasts several months, until\r\nOctober, but it is interrupted by the cold, which in the hills of\r\nSouth-Eastern Brazil covers the ponds with ice. Then the tremulous bass\r\nvoice of the males is heard no longer; they have all withdrawn beneath\r\nstones and trees in the neighbourhood of the water. The eggs are laid in\r\nstrings. The larvae are at first quite black and very small, and the young\r\nbaby-toads are only 1 cm. in length. They differ considerably from the\r\nadult until they are more than 1 inch long; the upper parts are yellowish\r\nbrown, with darker ocellated patches, each with a light seam, most\r\nconspicuous along the sides of the head and back. The under parts are grey,\r\nfinely stippled with yellow.\r\n\r\nBudgett[83] remarks that _B. marinus_ feeds on all kinds of insects. \"One\r\nhalf-grown specimen sitting by a man's foot picked off fifty-two mosquitoes\r\nin the space of one minute, picking them up with the tongue as they\r\nsettled. The call of this very common toad consists of three bell-like\r\nnotes; the middle one being the highest. The enormous parotoid glands are\r\ndischarged like squirts when the creature is roughly handled. When wet\r\nweather comes on it hops out from its hiding-place to sit in a puddle, with\r\nits head out.\"\r\n\r\nIn many species of _Bufo_ the crown of the head forms more or less\r\nprominent ridges, especially strong in the region between the eyes; for\r\ninstance, in _B. melanostictus_ and _B. lentiginosus_. The skin overlying\r\nthese ridges is liable to be involved in the cranial ossification, and this\r\nreaches its greatest extent in the two Cuban species _B. empusus_ and _B.\r\npeltocephalus_. It is a curious coincidence, to say the least, that such\r\ndermal ossifications should be best developed in Neotropical species, in\r\nthose very countries which amongst the Cystignathidae have produced the\r\nabnormal genera _Triprion_, _Calyptocephalus_, and _Pternohyla_. The most\r\npeculiar and odd-looking species is _Bufo ceratophrys_, a native of\r\nEcuador, which has the upper eyelid produced into a horn-like appendage,\r\nthe two sharply-pointed cones standing out transversely, reminding us of\r\nseveral species of the Cystignathoid genus _Ceratophrys_; there is also a\r\nseries of four small pointed {180}appendages on each side of the body.\r\nProtective concealment is possibly the reason of these queer outgrowths.\r\n\r\n_B. viridis_ s. _variabilis_, the Green or Variable Toad, reaches a length\r\nof about 3 inches, and is the prettiest toad of Europe. The skin is\r\ndistinctly smooth, the numerous porous, large and small warts being\r\nflattened. Parotoid glands are well developed, and a similar pair of glands\r\nsometimes occurs on the inner side of the calf, especially in Central\r\nAsiatic and in Algerian specimens. The coloration is very variable and\r\nchangeable. The ground-colour of the upper parts is creamy, with large and\r\nsmall, partly confluent and irregularly shaped spots and patches of green,\r\nhere and there interspersed with vermilion-red specks, especially along the\r\nsides of the back. The under parts are whitish, sometimes spotted with\r\nblack. The iris is brass-coloured, greenish-yellow, with fine dark dots.\r\nThe male does not differ from the female in size, but has an internal\r\nsubgular vocal sac, a conspicuous callosity on the inner side of the first\r\nfinger, and nuptial brushes on the first three fingers and on the inner\r\npalmar tubercle.\r\n\r\nThe changing of colour affects mainly the intensity of the green; the same\r\nindividual which now looks almost uniformly dull, almost grey, with dusky\r\nolive patches, will, if put into grass and sprinkled with water, within a\r\nfew minutes appear in a tastefully combined garb of grass-green on a creamy\r\nground. Some Southern and Eastern specimens have a creamy stripe along the\r\nvertebral line, thereby closely resembling _B. calamita_, from which,\r\nhowever, they can always be distinguished by the little pads below the\r\njoints of the toes; these pads being single in B. viridis, and double in\r\n_B. calamita_ and in _B. vulgaris_.\r\n\r\nThe Green Toad spends most of the day in holes, although it is not averse\r\nto daylight, and it roams about chiefly in the evening. It can jump well,\r\nmuch better and oftener than the Brown Toad. The food consists strictly of\r\ninsects of all kinds, and most individuals prefer slow starvation to eating\r\nan earthworm. Although continuing to live four or five years in captivity,\r\nthey do not readily become tame; they are indeed no longer wild, and when\r\nhandled they no longer emit their peculiar insipid smell, but on being\r\napproached they still crouch deeply into the grass, or withdraw into their\r\nholes, just as they did when recently caught. The voice is heard during the\r\npairing season, and sounds like the slow creaking of a door, or a\r\ncombination of a spinning top and {181}rattle. In Germany, during the\r\nmonths of April and May, they take to the ponds, or, improvident like the\r\ncommon frog, to a roadside ditch. The male sits upon the female and grasps\r\nher below the arms, his hands on her breast, and in this position they\r\nremain for days. The eggs are laid in two strings, twisted around\r\nwater-plants, and are very numerous. Héron-Royer has calculated them at\r\n10,000 or more in one set. The embryos are hatched, like those of the\r\nCommon Toad, before the appearance of the external gills and of the tail.\r\nIn this imperfect condition they remain in the jelly of the egg-strings for\r\na few days, while their external gills sprout out like unbranched little\r\nstumps, only to disappear again. In about eight weeks the tadpoles, which\r\nreach a length little more than 1½ inch or 40 mm., have metamorphosed and\r\nleave the water as baby-toads scarcely half an inch in length.\r\n\r\nThis species has a very wide range, namely, the whole of Middle Europe\r\nexcepting the British Isles, France and the Iberian Peninsula; the region\r\nbetween the Elbe and Rhine being its western limit; southwards it extends\r\nover all the Mediterranean islands and the north coast of Africa, eastwards\r\nthrough the whole of Russia, Western and Central Asia, not entering India,\r\nbut spreading along the Himalayas into China. Stoliczka mentions its having\r\nbeen found in the Himalayas at an altitude of 15,000 feet, the highest\r\nrecord of any Amphibian, at least in such latitudes.\r\n\r\n_B. calamita._–The Natterjack is practically the representative of the\r\nGreen Toad in Western Europe, but both species occur together in Denmark,\r\nSouthern Sweden, and nearly the whole of Germany. Its southern limit is\r\nGibraltar. In the British Isles it occurs in South-Western Ireland, in Co.\r\nKerry, and in England and Wales, being however local, and preferring sandy\r\nlocalities, where it is found in considerable numbers. This predilection is\r\nshown by its frequency on the sandy dunes of most of the islands off the\r\nGerman and Dutch coast, where it may be seen running about in glaring\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nBesides in the coloration, it differs from _B. viridis_ in the following\r\npoints. The little subarticular pads of the toe-joints are paired, not\r\nsingle, and the hind-limbs are decidedly shorter, so much so that this\r\nspecies cannot hop. But it runs well, like a mouse, generally in jerks,\r\nstopping every few seconds, and owing {182}to this habit it is called the\r\n\"running toad\" by the field-labourers of Cambridgeshire. The skin is\r\nsmooth, but less so than in _B. viridis_, owing to the slightly more\r\nprominent warts; the parotoids are small; a similar pair of glands lies on\r\nthe upper surface of the fore-arm and another on the calf. The tympanum is\r\nrather indistinct. The ground-colour of the upper parts is light brownish\r\nyellow, with a green tinge and scattered green spots; most specimens have a\r\nnarrow yellow stripe along the vertebral line and over the head. The under\r\nparts are white, more or less speckled with black. The iris is greenish\r\nyellow and speckled. The male, which is of the same size as the\r\nfemale,–very large specimens reaching 3 inches in length,–has a large\r\nsubgular vocal sac, and develops nuptial brushes on the first three\r\nfingers, but the first lacks the thickened pad of _B. viridis_.\r\n\r\nThe yellow vertebral line is sometimes absent in specimens from the south\r\nof France and the Iberian Peninsula; and since these southerners are as a\r\nrule more handsomely marked, the green being more pronounced and arranged\r\nin larger patches, interspersed with red spots, they much resemble _B.\r\nviridis_. Boulenger, who has paid especial attention to this vertebral\r\nstreak, which is a not uncommon design in various species of different\r\nfamilies, has made the interesting observation that the streak has never\r\nbeen found in Danish and German specimens of _B. viridis_, where _B.\r\ncalamita_ occurs also, while it is not uncommon in _B. viridis_ of Italy,\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe, Asia, and North Africa, where _B. calamita_ is not\r\nfound. Lastly, he remarks that in Eastern Asia, where neither _B. viridis_\r\nnor _B. calamita_ with such a line occurs, the same character is assumed by\r\nsome specimens of _B. vulgaris_. The only conclusion we can draw from these\r\nfacts is, that for some unknown reason the streak is a desirable, but not\r\nnecessary, possession, but that it is not kept by two species in the same\r\ncountry, _B. viridis_ dropping it entirely where the typically streaked\r\nspecies, _B. calamita_, also occurs. The breeding season does not begin in\r\nEngland and Middle Europe until the end of April, in cold springs not\r\nbefore May, but it lasts for several months. The males, congregating in\r\npools in great numbers, make a loud noise, each individual uttering a\r\nrattling note which lasts a few seconds, the repetition distending its\r\nbluish throat into the shape of a {183}globe as large as its head. As the\r\nnote is taken up by all the other males, a continuous chorus is\r\nestablished, which on warm and still nights can be heard nearly a mile off.\r\nSingle croaks are uttered at any time of the day. The embrace, the male\r\ndigging its fists into the armpits of the female, often takes place on\r\nland, near the edge of the water, to which they resort in the night for\r\nspawning. The egg-strings are slung around water-plants, unless the water\r\nis a mere puddle, and are much shorter than those of _B. viridis_,\r\nmeasuring only 5 to 6 feet, and containing altogether 3000 to 4000 eggs.\r\nThe larvae, when hatched, are very small, imperfect, and blackish; the\r\nexternal gills last a very short time. The young tadpoles live on mud,\r\nsubsisting on diatoms and low Algae; they are the smallest tadpoles of all\r\nthe European kinds, scarcely reaching more than one inch in length, and\r\nthey metamorphose quickly, the baby-toads leaving the water and running\r\nabout in less than six weeks, when they are only 10 mm., scarcely\r\nthree-eighths of an inch, in length. By the end of their second summer they\r\nare still only three-quarters of an inch long, and they do not reach\r\nmaturity until the fourth or fifth year, with a size of 1½ to 2 inches;\r\nstill smaller young males become mature several years before they are full\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nNatterjacks stand captivity well and become very tame. When discovered,\r\nthey first do their best to run away, instead of hiding or squatting down,\r\nand when caught they become covered with a slightly foamy lather, the\r\nexudation of their glands, which has a peculiar smell, reminding some\r\npeople of gunpowder, others of india-rubber. They are not very particular\r\nas to food, all sorts of insects and earthworms being taken. Natterjacks\r\nare great climbers and diggers. Many of mine have established themselves in\r\nthe peat with which the walls of the greenhouse are covered, where they\r\nhave dug out, or enlarged, holes in which they pass the daytime, just\r\npeeping out with their bright eyes; others sit high up, always in dry\r\nplaces, and bask. In the evening they descend, hunting about on the ground,\r\nand occasionally they go into the water, whereupon they become quite\r\nflaccid and soft. When taken up and held between two fingers, being\r\nslightly pressed under the armpits, both sexes utter little jerky notes,\r\nas–by the way–most toads and frogs do under similar conditions.\r\n\r\nIn Cambridgeshire they frequent certain clay-pits surrounded {184}by high\r\nand steep walls of sand, the breeding places of large colonies of\r\nsand-martins. During the months of May and June they are found in the\r\nshallow water, running about on the mud, sometimes swimming, in which they\r\nare not very proficient, and rarely diving. But they spend most of the time\r\non land. Early in October they climb up and enter the holes of the\r\nsand-martins, or they dig large, deep burrows for hibernation, and the old\r\nmales are the first to disappear.\r\n\r\n_B. mauritanica_ s. _pantherina_.–The \"Pantherine Toad\" is one of the few\r\nAfrican species, and is one of the prettiest of all toads. The skin is\r\nalmost smooth, although provided with porous glands. The parotoids are\r\nlarge, but flat; large glandular complexes on the legs or arms are absent.\r\nThe tympanum is very distinct. The upper parts are adorned with a delicate\r\npattern of dark-edged, rich brown or olive patches upon a light,\r\nbuff-coloured ground; the under parts are uniform white; the male has a\r\nsubgular vocal sac. The total length is 3 to 4 inches. This beautiful\r\nspecies is one of the gentlest, and it becomes tame enough to lap up food\r\nwhilst sitting on one's hand. It lives entirely upon insects, prefers shade\r\nand dusky light, and utters a sound like \"kooh-rr.\" It is a native of\r\nNorth-Western Africa, Algiers, and Morocco. In the rest of Africa, from\r\nEgypt to the Cape, Senegambia to Abyssinia, it is represented by _B.\r\nregularis_. This species has often little spiny tubercles upon the warts,\r\nand occasionally a light vertebral line; the colour of the upper parts\r\neither closely resembles that of the previous species, or it is uniform\r\nlight brown, while the under parts are whitish, or variegated with brownish\r\npatches. West African specimens are the smallest, only 2 inches long; those\r\nof the Cape are the largest, reaching 5 to 6 inches.\r\n\r\nThe next two genera approach the Engystomatinae, and thereby lead from the\r\narciferous towards the firmisternal type. The epicoracoid cartilages are\r\nnarrow, and they scarcely overlap, so that by a further step in this\r\ndirection they could easily fuse into the firmisternal condition. Another\r\nbond between these two genera and the Engystomatinae is their habits, they\r\nbeing ant-eaters of an extremely stout appearance, with exclusively short\r\nlimbs and very small heads.\r\n\r\n_Myobatrachus gouldi_, living in Australia, has a smooth skin, brown above,\r\nlighter beneath, and is about 2 inches long.\r\n\r\n{185}_Rhinophrynus dorsalis_ of Mexico is remarkable for its tongue, which\r\nis elongated, subtriangular and free in front, so that it can be protruded\r\ndirectly–not by reversion as in other toads–and can be used for licking up\r\nthe termites which seem to be its principal food. The body of this ugly\r\ncreature is almost egg-shaped, and the head is merged into this mass, only\r\nthe narrow truncated snout protruding. The limbs are very short and stout.\r\nThe toes are more than half webbed, and there is a large oval, shovel-like\r\nmetatarsal tubercle, covered with horn and used for digging. The general\r\ncolour is brown, with a yellow stripe along the spine and with irregular\r\nspots and patches on the flanks and limbs. Total length 2 to 2½ inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.–Map showing distribution of Hylidae. The vertically\r\nshaded countries are inhabited by _Hyla_ and by other genera of Hylidae;\r\nthe horizontally shaded countries only by _Hyla_.]\r\n\r\nFAM. 4. HYLIDAE (Tree-frogs).–The upper jaw–in _Amphignathodon_ the lower\r\njaw also–and the vomers carry teeth; _Triprion_ and _Diaglena_ alone have\r\nteeth on the parasphenoid also, and the latter genus is further\r\ndistinguished by possessing palatine teeth. The vertebrae are procoelous\r\nand have no ribs; the sacral diapophyses are dilated. The omo- and\r\nmeta-sternum are cartilaginous, the latter forming a plate with scarcely\r\nany basal or style-shaped constriction. The terminal phalanges are\r\ninvariably claw-shaped and swollen at the base, and carry a flattened,\r\nroundish, adhesive cushion. The tympanic disc is variable in appearance,\r\nbeing either free, or more or less hidden by the skin. The tongue is also\r\nvariable in its shape and in the extent to which it can be protruded.\r\n\r\n{186}Most, if not all, Hylidae are climbers, and many lead an arboreal\r\nlife, but it does not follow that all the \"Tree-frogs\" are green.\r\n\r\nTheir distribution is very remarkable. To say that this family is\r\ncosmopolitan with the exception of the African region, is literally true,\r\nbut very misleading. There are in all about 150 species, and of these 100\r\nare Notogaean; one-half of the whole number, or 75, being Neotropical; 23\r\nare Central American, 7 Antillean, and about 18 are found in North America.\r\nOne species, _Hyla arborea_, extends over nearly the whole Palaearctic\r\nsub-region, and two closely allied forms occur in Northern India and\r\nSouthern China. Consequently, with this exception of three closely allied\r\nspecies, the Hylidae are either American or Australian. We conclude that\r\ntheir original home was Notogaea, and that they have spread northwards\r\nthrough Central and into North America. The enormous moist and steamy\r\nforests of South America naturally suggest themselves as a paradise for\r\ntree-frogs, and it is in this country, especially in the Andesian and the\r\nadjoining Central American sub-regions, that the greatest diversity of\r\ngeneric and specific forms has been produced. It is all the more remarkable\r\nthat similar forest-regions, like those of Borneo and other Malay islands,\r\nare absolutely devoid of Hylidae (while there are about a dozen species in\r\nPapuasia), whose place has however been taken for all practical purposes by\r\ncorrespondingly modified Ranidae, notably the genus _Rhacophorus_. Lastly,\r\nthe fact that tropical evergreen forests of Africa and Madagascar possess\r\nno Hylidae, but are inhabited by several kinds of tree-climbing\r\n_Rhacophorus_, points with certainty to the conclusion that the origin of\r\nthis large and flourishing family of Hylidae was not in Arctogaea.\r\n\r\nThe versatility and the wide distribution of the Hylidae has naturally\r\nproduced cases of convergent analogy, and the various species of one\r\n\"genus\" may be in reality a heterogeneous assembly. Such an instance is\r\nprobably the genus _Hylella_, of which four species live in the Andesian\r\nand Central American provinces, while the two others occur in New Guinea\r\nand Australia.\r\n\r\nThe two North American genera _Chorophilus_ and _Acris_, and the Brazilian\r\n_Thoropa_, connect the Hylidae with the Cystignathidae, in so far as their\r\nfinger-discs are very small, or even {187}absent, and their sacral\r\ndiapophyses are only slightly dilated. On the other hand, it has to be\r\nemphasised that the possession of adhesive discs on the fingers and toes\r\ndoes not necessarily constitute a member of the Hylidae. That requires _the\r\nfurther combination of an arciferous sternum, with dilated sacral\r\ndiapophyses and teeth in the upper jaw_. Finger-discs are easily developed,\r\nand still more easily lost. Those of the typical Hylidae are constructed as\r\nfollows. The terminal phalanx is elongated, claw-shaped, swollen at its\r\nbase. Between it and the penultimate phalanx lies an interphalangeal\r\ncartilaginous disc which projects ventrally below the end-phalanx, thus\r\nassisting the formation of the ventral pad, and the turning upwards of the\r\nwhole disc-like phalanx like the claw of a cat. This peculiar motion can be\r\nwell observed in Tree-frogs which are at rest upon a horizontal leaf, or,\r\nbetter still, upon a rough stone, when the creatures take good care to\r\nadjust their discs into a safe and easy position. The pad or disc itself is\r\nfurnished with unstriped, smooth muscular fibres, the contraction of which\r\nproduces one or more longitudinal furrows on the under side. When the disc\r\nis in action or adhering, being flattened to a smooth surface, the\r\nend-phalanx sinks into the cushion; when not in action, the cushion swells\r\nand the phalanx appears as a slight dorsal ridge. The disc is rich in\r\nlymph-spaces, and its surface contains mucilaginous glands.\r\n\r\nVarious suggestions have been made to explain the function of these discs.\r\nSuction, adhesion, and glueing-on have been resorted to. Suction, through\r\nproduction of a vacuum, is quite imaginary and does not exist. The question\r\nhas been thoroughly studied by Schuberg.[84] Adhesion is due to the\r\nmolecular attraction of two closely appressed bodies. The less air remains\r\nbetween them the stronger it is. Consequently it can be increased by the\r\ninterference of a thin layer of fluid, which as everyday observation shows,\r\npossesses both adhesion and cohesion. The more sticky the fluid, the more\r\neffective it is, as shown experimentally by Schuberg, who moistened the\r\nunder surface of a glass plate, and pressed it against a little disc of\r\nglass from which was suspended a weight. A disc of 16 square millimetres,\r\napproximately equal to the aggregate surface of the 18 discs of a European\r\ntree-frog of 4 grammes in weight, carried with water-adhesion {188}no less\r\nthan 14 grammes, with glycerine-solution 20 grammes,–more than sufficient\r\nto suspend the frog. The sticky secretion of its glands greatly enhances\r\nthe adhesive power. Tree-frogs, when hopping on to a vertical plane of\r\nclean glass, slide down a little, probably until the secretion stiffens, or\r\ndries into greater consistency. After a few days I find the glass-walls of\r\ntheir recently cleaned cage quite dirty, covered everywhere with their\r\nfinger-marks. On the other hand, wet leaves or moist glass-walls afford no\r\nhold. The adhesion of these frogs is assisted in most cases by their soft\r\nand moist bellies, just as a dead frog will stick to a pane of glass.\r\n\r\nAll Hylidae have a voice, often very loud, and enhanced by vocal sacs,\r\nwhich are either internal, swelling out the throat, or external, paired or\r\nunpaired.\r\n\r\nThe various Hylidae resort to all kinds of modes of rearing their broods.\r\nMost of them lay many eggs, up to one thousand, in the water, not coherent\r\nin strings but in clumps; others lay only a few, attach them to various\r\nparts of the body, or, as in the genus _Nototrema_, the female receives\r\nthem in a dorsal pouch. These modifications will be described in connexion\r\nwith the different species.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. AMPHIGNATHODONTINAE.–_Both upper and lower jaw with teeth._\r\n\r\n_Amphignathodon_, of which only one species is known, _A. guentheri_ of\r\nEcuador, agrees with _Nototrema_ in all important characters except that it\r\npossesses teeth in the lower jaw in addition to those in the upper. There\r\nare further differences, but they are of degree only. The sacral\r\ndiapophyses are more strongly dilated and the omosternum is absent. The\r\ntympanum is distinct. The pupil is horizontal; the roundish tongue is\r\nslightly free behind. The terminal phalanges are claw-shaped and carry\r\nlarge discs. The female has a dorsal pouch opening backwards. The skin of\r\nthe head is involved in the ossification of the cranial bones. The skin of\r\nthe back is smooth, slightly tubercular, non-granular below. The middle of\r\nthe upper eyelid carries a small, pointed, cutaneous appendage, and even\r\nthis little character occurs also in some species of _Nototrema_, _e.g._ in\r\n_N. longipes_ and in _N. cornutum_. The heel carries a triangular little\r\nflap. The upper parts are olive in spirit-specimens, probably green in\r\nlife; the borders of the dorsal pouch {189}are black. The sides of the body\r\nare adorned with a black, white-edged streak, the limbs are whitish, with\r\nblack cross-bars. The total length of the female type-specimen is 3 inches.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2.

The\r\ntongue is entire or slightly nicked in its hinder margin, which is more or\r\nless free behind. The fingers and toes are provided with typical adhesive\r\ndiscs.\r\n\r\nThis is the largest genus of all Amphibia, containing about 150 species,\r\nand its distribution coincides with that of the whole family. Many of the\r\nspecies are very closely allied to each {190}other, differing only in small\r\npoints, for instance in the extent of the webs to the fingers and toes, the\r\nconfiguration of the vomerine teeth, the size and appearance of the\r\ntympanic disc, and the relative length of the hind-limbs. In some of the\r\nWest Indian, and in one Brazilian species, _H. nigromaculata_, the upper\r\nsurface of the head is rough, owing to the cutis being involved in the\r\ncranial ossification. Bony or perhaps only calcareous deposits in other\r\nparts of the skin are rare, but are notably developed in _H. dasynotus_ of\r\nBrazil, in which they extend from the head to the sacrum, rendering the\r\nskin immovable.\r\n\r\nMany are capable of changing colour to a great extent, and it is a popular\r\nerror to suppose that all tree-frogs are green, although this colour is\r\nperhaps the most common in the arboreal kinds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.–_Hyla arborea_, var. _meridionalis_. South European\r\nTree-frog, × 1.]\r\n\r\n_H. arborea._–The tongue is rather round, slightly nicked behind, and can\r\nbe protruded but little. The tympanum is distinct, but small. The upper\r\nparts are grass-green, quite smooth and shiny owing to the skin being\r\ncovered with a film of moisture; the under parts are yellowish-white and\r\ngranular, flesh-coloured or rosy on the thighs. Total length of large\r\nfemales 2 inches. This, the Tree-frog of Europe, has an enormous range,\r\nnamely, from Morocco, France, and the south of Sweden, across the whole of\r\nEurope and Asia Minor to Japan and Southern China.\r\n\r\n{191}Several varieties have been described: the _typical_ or _European\r\nform_ is ornamented with a narrow black stripe, which, beginning at the\r\nnose, extends backwards along the side of the body to the groin, where it\r\ngenerally forms a hook turned upwards. This black colour forms the ventral\r\nboundary of the green, and is itself narrowly seamed with white on its\r\nupper border.\r\n\r\nIn the south of France, the Iberian Peninsula, Morocco, and the Canary\r\nIslands the black lateral stripe is often absent; this is the var.\r\n_meridionalis_. In Spain and Portugal both forms are found in the same\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nIn the Asiatic, chiefly in the eastern specimens, the lateral stripes tend\r\nto break up into irregular spots, vanishing altogether towards the groins;\r\nthis var. _savignyi_ s. _japonica_ occurs also on most of the Mediterranean\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n_H. arborea_ can change colour to a great extent, mostly in adaptation to\r\nits immediate surroundings, but ill health and moulting may also influence\r\nit. The change is slow. The usual colour is green, brightest on bright,\r\nsunny hot days, dull when the sky is overcast, or when it is windy and\r\nshowery. Day and night have no influence upon the colour-changes. The hue\r\nof the green agrees mostly with that of the foliage on which the frog\r\nhappens to take its rest, for instance a field of Indian corn, birch-trees,\r\nor oak-trees. I once received a consignment from Saxony. When the box with\r\nmoss was unpacked, they were of the dullest greenish-grey; they were put\r\ninto a wired-off corner of the yard and were given the freshly cut branches\r\nof a lime-tree to sit upon. On the following morning I at first looked for\r\nmost of the frogs in vain. The leaves had withered and all those frogs\r\nwhich sat upon the dark brown branches had put on a light brown garb,\r\nmottled with darker patches.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen, one of several which were at liberty in a greenhouse,\r\ntook to resting on the frame of the window-pane, in a corner where putty,\r\nglass, and discoloured white paint met; in the morning it was always of a\r\nmottled leaden colour, but during the nocturnal hunting it was green. In\r\nthe winter, the window-corner being of course cold, the frog remained\r\nstationary for several months, but kept the leaden grey colour, until one\r\nday in the early spring it was mottled with green, and soon after it joined\r\nits green mates.\r\n\r\nLiebe observed a half grown tree-frog which he kept in Gera {192}during the\r\nwinter in a glass with water-cress. While the temperature was near freezing\r\nthe frog sat in the water, very lethargic, breathing perhaps once every\r\nquarter of an hour. Its colour was light green. When the water-cress was\r\ncut and removed, the frog darkened and became at last quite a discoloured\r\ngrey. When the water-cress was put back, the creature reassumed the light\r\nyellowish-green colour, remaining in its lethargic condition until it\r\nbecame lively in the spring sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe European tree-frog spends most of its time in the summer, after the\r\npairing is over, in trees, often in the very crowns; but the neighbourhood\r\nof even a small patch of Indian corn has still greater attractions. There\r\nare all sorts of green insects to be caught, there are fair chances of\r\ncoming across the common Cabbage White, a butterfly which the tree-frog\r\nloves, and last not least the large luscious leaves afford a firm foothold,\r\nand the axillae between stalk and broad-based leaves are just the places\r\nfor the frog to slip into, where nobody can find it. During the day they\r\nmostly sit still, on the keen look-out for passing insects, which, when\r\nthey settle within reach, are jumped at; otherwise they have first to be\r\nstalked. The jump is quite fearless, regardless of the height above ground;\r\nthere is the leaf upon which the prey sits, and even if this leaf be\r\nmissed, there are others, and one of them is sure to be struck by some of\r\nthe discs of either fingers or toes. If the fall is broken by the toes, and\r\nthe new leaf or branch is very elastic and bends down, then there are some\r\nfrantic antics to be gone through until the frog has settled itself again.\r\nThen the large blue-bottle, or the butterfly, is devoured at leisure, wings\r\nand all being poked in with the assistance of the little hands. But the\r\nreal hunting-time is the night.\r\n\r\nDuring a shower the frog shifts its position to the under side of the leaf,\r\nor into a less slippery position, and during continuous wet it descends\r\ninto the grass, or it takes to the water. Its greatest enemy is the Grass\r\nSnake, which prefers it to anything else, not minding the poisonous\r\nsecretion of the skin, which is sharp enough to produce sneezing or even\r\ntemporary blindness when incautiously brought into the human eye.\r\n\r\nThe male has an internal vocal sac, which, when inflated, bulges out the\r\nwhole throat into a globe, much larger than the head. The voice is a sharp\r\nand rapidly-repeated note, something {193}like \"epp-epp-epp,\" or \"creck,\r\ncreck, creck,\" with more or less of an _a_ sound. It is uttered at any time\r\nof the day, more frequently at dusk, and of course chiefly during the\r\npairing season. This tree-frog suffers from the reputation of being a good\r\nweather-prophet, and it is for this reason often kept in confinement, the\r\northodox abode being a muslin-covered glass jar, with a hole to put flies\r\nthrough, water and plants at the bottom, and a little ladder to sit upon.\r\nThe prophesying is of the usual popular unreliable nature, although the\r\nlittle creature, provided it is a male, often sounds its voice on the\r\napproach of a shower, or when there is a thunderstorm in the air. During\r\ncontinuous fine weather it sits on the top of the ladder, or is glued on\r\nnear the rim of the glass, while on wet and dull days it is less active,\r\nand may keep nearer the ground or in the water. There is a German rhyme\r\nwhich well expresses the prophet's reliability by its ambiguity:–\r\n\r\n  Wenn die Laubfrösche knarren,\r\n  Magst du auf Regen harren.\r\n\r\nWhen the tree-frogs croak, you may wait for rain. Sometimes it does come\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nTree-frogs are not very intelligent, although they have a keen sense of\r\nlocality; but they are nice pets, being easily kept, and have a pretty\r\nappearance. There is a record of one which lived for twenty-two years in\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nThe pairing begins soon after the frogs reappear from their hibernation in\r\nthe ground; in Germany in the month of May. The congregating males make a\r\ngreat noise and take to the water before the females, which join them when\r\nready to spawn. The male grasps his mate near the shoulders, and the pair\r\nswim about together, sometimes for days, until the eggs are expelled. These\r\nare laid in small clumps of 800 to 1000, which soon swell up and remain at\r\nthe bottom of the pond. The larvae are hatched in ten days; two days later\r\nthe adhesive sucker below the throat appears, and after another two days a\r\npair of thread-like external gills are developed. The tadpoles, which reach\r\na length of 2 inches, owing to the long tail, which is nearly three times\r\nas long as the body, metamorphose in about twelve weeks, and the baby\r\ntree-frogs, scarcely half an inch in length, hide in the grass for the next\r\ntwo years, until they are about half grown, not reaching maturity until the\r\nfourth year.\r\n\r\n{194}Since many pairs congregate in the same pool, and each produces up to\r\none thousand eggs, most of which are hatched, the neighbouring meadows\r\nsometimes literally swarm with tiny tree-frogs. Nevertheless the adults are\r\ncomparatively rare and are very local.\r\n\r\n_H. carolinensis_ s. _lateralis_ of the South-Eastern States of North\r\nAmerica greatly resembles _H. arborea_ in general appearance, size, and\r\nhabits. But the head is more pointed, and the vivid green of the upper\r\nparts is separated from the yellowish white under surface by a conspicuous,\r\npure white line, giving the little creature a very smart and neat\r\nappearance. According to Holbrook, it ascends trees, but most commonly lies\r\nupon broad-leaved water-plants, like _Nymphaea_, and in fields of Indian\r\ncorn. Motionless during the daytime, they emerge in the morning and evening\r\nfrom their hiding-places, and become very brisk and noisy, often repeating\r\ntheir single note, which is not unlike that of a small bell. When one\r\nbegins, hundreds take it up from all parts of the corn-field.\r\n\r\nAmong other tree-frogs of the South-Eastern States may be mentioned _H.\r\nsquirella_, 1½ inch in length, which is very changeable in colour,\r\ngenerally olive above with darker spots and bars on the limbs, and with a\r\nwhite upper lip. It lives in trees, sheltering in the bark. _H. femoralis_\r\nof the same size, without the white lip, lives high up in the trees of the\r\ndense forests of Georgia and Carolina.\r\n\r\n_H. versicolor_ is one of the most delicately coloured species of Eastern\r\nNorth America, extending northwards into Canada. It is about 2 inches long.\r\nIts colour passes within a short time from dark brown or olive grey to pale\r\ndelicate grey, almost white, occasionally retaining a few large darker\r\npatches on the back, and delicate cross-bars on the limbs. A small portion\r\nof the sides and the posterior part of the belly are bright yellow. The\r\nskin is granular, owing to the presence of small warts which produce an\r\nacrid secretion. It is said to be found in trees, or about old stone fences\r\novergrown with lichens, the colour of which it resembles to perfection. It\r\nbecomes very noisy towards the evening, in cloudy weather or before rain,\r\nthe voice consisting of a liquid note, terminating abruptly, like\r\n\"l-l-l-l-luk.\" My own captives fully bear out this statement of Holbrook's.\r\nSettled motionless during the day upon a piece of bark in a shady\r\n{195}corner, but occasionally uttering the quaint and rather faint note,\r\nthey become very lively in the evening, catching insects by long jumps, or\r\ninvestigating the hollows of decaying mossy stumps. Their general colour is\r\nthen spotless, almost silvery grey. In the day-time they are sometimes\r\nsuffused with delicate green.\r\n\r\nThe propagation has been studied by Miss M. H. Hinckley.[85] They pair in\r\nshallow pools, in Massachusetts, in May. On the 10th of that month eggs\r\nwere attached singly, and in groups, on the grasses resting upon the\r\nsurface of the water; first drab-coloured, they became lighter in a few\r\nhours. Some larvae escaped from the gelatinous envelopes on the following\r\nday, the others on the third day; they clung to the grasses by means of\r\ntheir prominent suckers. The head and body were cream-coloured, with olive\r\ndots, and averaged ¼ inch in length. Gills appeared on the fourth day, to\r\ndisappear again during the four following days, first those of the right,\r\nthen those of the left, side; the suckers became less conspicuous, and the\r\ngeneral colour turned into deep olive-green, with fine golden dots on the\r\nupper and lower surfaces. The eyes were of a brilliant flame-colour. On the\r\neleventh day the suckers or \"holders\" had disappeared, and the hind-limbs\r\nwere indicated by small white buds. By June 5th, _i.e._ the twenty-seventh\r\nday, the toes developed the terminal discs; the mottling of gold had given\r\nway to a uniform olive or pea-green. Movements of the future arms beneath\r\nthe skin appeared on the 28th of June, at the age of seven weeks. The arms,\r\nmostly the right one first, were thrust out on the 2nd of July; the fins of\r\nthe tail were absorbed rapidly, and towards the end of the seventh week the\r\nnearly transformed creatures began to leave the water. The young frogs\r\nchanged colour rapidly, in adaptation to their surroundings, but the four\r\nspecimens which survived were never all found to be of the same colour\r\nduring the next three months. They first lived upon Aphides, later upon\r\nflies, and they were alert nocturnally. About the beginning of October they\r\nleft the fronds of their fernery and nestled away in the damp earth, which\r\nthey left only when the temperature rose above 60° F.\r\n\r\n_H. vasta_ of Hayti is the giant of the tree-frogs, reaching a length of 5\r\ninches. In order to support its great weight the {196}adhesive discs of the\r\nfingers and toes are of a surprising size, about as large as a threepenny\r\npiece. The skin is covered with small warts, and forms a peculiar fold on\r\nthe hinder surface of the fore-arm and on the tarsus, and small flaps near\r\nthe vent. The colour is grey above, blackish on the head, with a brown band\r\nbetween the eyes; the under parts are flesh-coloured, the throat with black\r\nspots.\r\n\r\n_H. maxima_, of the forests of British Guiana, is scarcely less gigantic,\r\nand is distinguished by a projecting rudiment of the pollex, while the\r\nadhesive discs are smaller than the tympanum. The skin forms folds on the\r\narms and tarsus, like those of _H. vasta_, in addition to a triangular flap\r\nat the heel. The general colour is reddish-brown above, sometimes with a\r\ndark vertebral line, the under parts are whitish and covered with large\r\ngranules; the throat of the male, which has an inner vocal sac, is brown.\r\n\r\n_H. faber_ of Brazil is closely allied to the last species, but the skin of\r\nits upper parts is quite smooth. There is a small tarsal fold, and one\r\nextending from the upper eyelid to the shoulder. It is light brown above,\r\nwith darker marks which form a conspicuous vertebral line, transverse bars\r\non the hind-limbs, and a few irregular, scattered, vermicular or linear\r\nmarks on the head and body. The adult, when put into a strong light, will\r\nrapidly turn pale; at night the longitudinal stripe on the back and the\r\nbars on the hind-limbs become very distinct; the under parts are white, and\r\nexhibit a beautiful orange tinge. This is the famous \"_Ferreiro_\" or\r\n\"smith.\" As will be seen from the following graphic account by Dr.\r\nGoeldi[86] of Para, this species doubly deserves its name of _faber_, not\r\nonly in virtue of its voice, but also because of the marvellous\r\nnest-building habits recently discovered.\r\n\r\n\"The _Ferreiro_ is common in the Province Rio de Janeiro, more frequently\r\nstill in the mountain regions of the Serra dos Orgãos than in the hot\r\nlowland. Its voice is one of the most characteristic sounds to be heard in\r\ntropical South America. Fancy the noise of a mallet, slowly and regularly\r\nbeaten upon a copper plate, and you will have a pretty good idea of the\r\nconcert, given generally by several individuals at the same time and with\r\nslight variations in tone and intensity. When you approach the {197}spot\r\nwhere the Tree-frog sits, the sound ceases. But keep quiet, and it will be\r\nresumed after a few moments. You will discover the frog on a grass-stem, on\r\na leaf of a low branch, or in the mud. Seize it quickly, for it is a most\r\nwonderful jumper, and it will utter a loud and shrill, most startling cry,\r\nsomewhat similar to that of a wounded cat.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Smith\" makes very regular pools, in the shallow water of ponds, or\r\nnurseries for the tadpoles surrounded by a circular wall of mud. Dr. Goeldi\r\nhas watched the building process during a moonlit night: \"We soon saw a\r\nmass of mud rising to the surface carried by a Tree-frog, of which no more\r\nthan the two hands emerged. Diving again, after a moment's time, the frog\r\nbrought up a second mass of mud, near the first. This was repeated many\r\ntimes, the result being the gradual erection of a circular wall. From time\r\nto time the builder's head and front part of body appeared suddenly with a\r\nload of mud on some opposite point. But what astonished us in the highest\r\ndegree was the manner in which it used its hands for smoothing the inside\r\nof the mud wall, as would a mason with his trowel. When the height of the\r\nwall reached about 4 inches, the frog was obliged to get out of the water.\r\nThe parapet of the wall receives the same careful smoothing, but the\r\noutside is neglected. The levelling of the bottom is obtained by the action\r\nof the lower surface (belly and throat principally) together with that of\r\nthe hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe male takes no active share in the construction of the nest, but will\r\nsuddenly climb up the wall of his home, and then upon the back of his busy\r\nmate. The building operation may take one or two nights, and is performed\r\nin the most absolute silence; the croakers around are all males clamouring\r\nfor a mate.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are laid during one of the following nights, and are hatched some\r\nfour or five days later, the parents keeping hidden in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe nursery. Heavy rains may destroy the walls, and thus prematurely\r\nrelease the tadpoles.\r\n\r\nIt is only owing to such keen observers and lovers of nature's fascinating\r\nways that the breeding habits of some Brazilian Hylidae have become known.\r\n\r\n_H. nebulosa_ s. _luteola_ also living in Brazil, is yellow above, with\r\nbrown dots; the sides of the belly and thighs have {198}transverse bluish\r\nbars, the under parts are whitish. Its size is under 2 inches. Goeldi has\r\noften found it in the sheaths of decaying banana-leaves. It glues the lumps\r\nof eggs on to the edges and to the inside of the withered leaves, where\r\neven during the hot hours of the day sufficient coolness and moisture are\r\npreserved. These lumps are enveloped in a frothy substance, in which the\r\nnearly metamorphosed tadpoles can be watched wriggling. If these are put\r\ninto water, all will die in a few hours.\r\n\r\n_H. polytaenia_ deposits its eggs in free lumpy masses on water-plants. It\r\nis a small creature, little more than 1 inch in length, light olive above,\r\nwith numerous brown parallel longitudinal bands on the body and limbs. A\r\ndark, white-edged band extends from the nose along the side of the body.\r\nThe heel has a short flap of skin. The male has an internal vocal sac.\r\n\r\n_H. goeldii_ is a most interesting form, leading to the allied genus\r\n_Nototrema_. Boulenger[87] has described a female which was captured by\r\nGoeldi in January on the Serra dos Orgãos. It is about 1½ inch long. The\r\nwhole surface of the back is occupied by a layer of twenty-six pale yellow\r\neggs which are 4 mm. in diameter. The skin of the back is expanded into a\r\nfeebly reverted fold, which borders and supports the mass of eggs on the\r\nsides, thus suggesting an incipient stage of a dorsal brood-pouch. Owing to\r\nthe great amount of yolk, the young are probably able to remain upon the\r\nmother until they are nearly metamorphosed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.–_Hyla goeldii._ × 1. Female with eggs in the\r\nincipient dorsal brood-pouch.]\r\n\r\n_H. coerulea_ s. _cyanea_ is one of the largest Australian green\r\ntree-frogs, ranging from the South to the very North of Australia. The\r\ndiscs are as large as the fully-exposed tympanum. There is no projecting\r\nrudiment of the pollex, but a slight cutaneous fold borders the inner side\r\nof the tarsus. The skin is smooth and shiny, always a little moist, and\r\nstudded with numerous rather large pores on the nape and shoulders; this\r\nsomewhat thickened region forms a prominent fold which begins behind the\r\neyes. The belly and the under parts of the thighs are granular as in most\r\nHylidae. The male has an internal vocal {199}sac; and during the breeding\r\nseason, which seems to occur during our autumn and winter, develops brown\r\nrugosities on the inner side of the first finger. The tongue is round,\r\nslightly notched behind and free enough to be protruded a little.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.–_Hyla coerulea._ Australian Tree-frog (from\r\nphotographs). Length of the large specimen 4.2 inches. The upper right\r\nspecimen with vocal sac inflated.]\r\n\r\nThe alternative specific names are most unfortunately chosen, as they apply\r\nonly to spirit-specimens. During life this tree-frog exhibits a\r\nconsiderable amount of colour-changes. The normal colour is bright green\r\nabove, white below. A conspicuous feature of this species is the frequent\r\noccurrence of white specks or spots, which are probably due to the\r\ndeposition of guanine, a peculiar white colouring matter. The spots appear\r\nin any part of the green skin, and are quite irregular in their\r\ndistribution. Sometimes they remain for weeks in the same place, or they\r\ndisappear after a few days and others appear. They are in no way connected\r\nwith the shedding of the skin, nor do they indicate ill-health. _H.\r\ncoerulea_ lives well in confinement, and becomes tame enough to take food\r\nfrom one's fingers, even when sitting upon the hand. Some of mine took to\r\nliving during the daytime in a small box, preferring a crowded condition in\r\ncompanionship with {200}Natterjacks. Others squeeze themselves into the\r\nmost uncomfortable cracks, while others again prefer the broad leaves of\r\n_Philodendron_. A favourite place for two or three at a time is the\r\nfunnel-shaped spaces formed by _Bromelia_-plants. Those specimens which are\r\nhidden in the box or in the hollows of rotten stumps are, almost without\r\nexception, dull, very dark brownish olive, while those on the Bromelias\r\nassume exactly the sombre dull green of its leaves. Lastly, those which sit\r\nin the light, exposed places, no matter if upon a leaf, on a white stone,\r\nor upon a board, are emerald-green, especially beautiful on hot, sunny\r\ndays;–and they are not always averse to the full glare of the sun. When\r\nsquatting upon a flat surface, such as a broad leaf, they tuck the\r\nfore-paws under the head like a cat, and with half open eyelids, the pupil\r\ncontracted to a tiny slit, so that the golden iris is exposed, they remain\r\nmotionless during the day. They take food when offered, but at night they\r\nroam about, either hopping on the ground, or making enormous leaps from\r\nleaf to leaf, sometimes deliberately stalking some choice insect, and\r\npatiently climbing up a stem, hand over hand. At night their whole aspect\r\nis changed. The colour is saturated green, the eyes are transformed into\r\nround, projecting shiny black beads, and the head is erect. The ludicrously\r\ndreamy, complacent look has given way to wide-awake alertness. They take\r\nall kinds of living food. When they find an earthworm, they first look at\r\nit, bending the head sharply down, lift themselves upon the fore-limbs and\r\nthen pounce upon it, nipping the prey with the jaws, and then poking it\r\ndown deliberately with the hands. Cockroaches are simply lapped up, and\r\ndisappear in the twinkle of an eye. Mealworms, wood-lice, butterflies and\r\nmoths, flies and spiders are taken. The stomach of a specimen in the\r\nDresden Museum, from the Aru Islands, contained some four or five young\r\nfreshwater Crustaceans of the genus _Sesarma_. They fortunately do not\r\nmolest smaller frogs of their own kind and of other species. Like many\r\nAmphibia they like a change of diet, and ultimately refuse their food if it\r\nis unvaried. To my surprise my largest specimen, which measures a little\r\nmore than 4 inches, takes snails, _Helix virgata_, half-a-dozen at a time,\r\nand on the following day, not during the night, vomits the sucked-out\r\nshells in a lump, like the pellets of birds of prey. During this rather\r\npainful-looking procedure the whole tongue and about half an {201}inch of\r\nthe everted gullet are protruded out of the mouth, and are then slowly\r\nwithdrawn. After having roamed about all night, they return to their\r\nrespective resting-places, where each individual is sure to be found in\r\nexactly the same spot, day after day. They do not mind being looked at, but\r\nif taken up and put back they avoid that place for perhaps a week, taking\r\nshelter somewhere else.\r\n\r\nBoth sexes have a voice, but that of the female is only a grunting noise,\r\nwhile the male inflates its gular sac and sends forth a sharp cracking\r\nsound, which can turn into a regular bellowing like the gruff barking of an\r\nangry dog. They bellow at any time of the year, frequently on the approach\r\nof a shower or during a thunderstorm. Certain noises will also induce them\r\nto bark. The rattling produced by the syringing of the greenhouse, sawing\r\nof wood, hammering, the raking of the gravel, or even the scraping of boots\r\non the gravel-path is liable to start one of the males, and the others are\r\nsure to chime in.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fletcher, _H. coerulea_ and _H. aurea_ lay their eggs in round\r\nwhite frothy patches, which float in the water, chiefly during the months\r\nof August and September; but when the spring months are very dry, the\r\npairing is delayed until the following January. Several other Australian\r\nspecies of _Hyla_, e.g. _H. ewingi_, spawn at any time of the year if the\r\nconditions are favourable. They attach their eggs to submerged blades of\r\ngrass or to twigs.\r\n\r\n_H. aurea_ is one of the commonest and most beautiful species, occurring\r\nthroughout Australia and Tasmania, excepting of course in the large\r\ndeserts. It has the appearance and restlessness of a water-frog, is not\r\nunlike _Rana esculenta_, and grows to about three inches in length. The\r\ntympanum is very distinct, but rather small. The fingers are without a\r\npollex-rudiment, the tarsus has a fold along its inner edge. The adhesive\r\ndiscs are decidedly small. The male has two internal vocal sacs, which\r\nbulge out sideways. The skin is smooth and shiny. The under parts are\r\nwhite; the upper parts are, speaking generally, a mixture of blue and\r\nolive, with blue or brown spots, but spirit-specimens give no idea of the\r\nbeauty which this changeable species can assume. Sometimes the same\r\nindividual is saturated blue and green, with several longitudinal stripes\r\nof burnished copper along the back; a few minutes later the stripes glitter\r\n{202}like gold, and in other moods the whole upper surface is mottled blue,\r\ngreen, and brown. My specimens often went into the water and did not climb.\r\nThe food is said to consist chiefly of other small frogs in preference to\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n_Nototrema_ differs from _Hyla_ in so far as the female has a pouch on the\r\nback for the reception of the eggs. This bag is formed by an infolding of\r\nthe skin; it opens backwards in front of the vent, it has a sphincter and\r\nis permanent, although it distends to larger dimensions when in use. An\r\ninitial stage of such a pouch is possessed by _Hyla goeldii_ (Fig. 38). The\r\npupil is horizontal, the tongue can be protruded but little; the tympanum\r\nis free, and the adhesive discs of the fingers and toes are well developed.\r\nThese \"marsupial frogs,\" of which about half-a-dozen species are known,\r\nlive chiefly in the tropical forest-region of South America, notably from\r\nPeru to Venezuela.\r\n\r\n_N. marsupiatum_ is green with darker blue-green spots, or with\r\nlongitudinal patches which are each surrounded by a whitish or yellow seam\r\nof little dots. The limbs have cross-bars. Total length about 2½ to 3\r\ninches. The eggs of this species are comparatively small and numerous. The\r\nvery small tadpoles have no external gills, and escape from the pouch to\r\nfinish their metamorphosis in the water.\r\n\r\n_N. testudineum_, about 3 inches in length, is of a uniform lead-colour,\r\nbut is lighter beneath. The skin of the back is studded with stellate\r\ncalcareous deposits, a peculiarity which is alluded to in the specific\r\nname.\r\n\r\n_N. oviferum_ is brown above, with darker patches on the sides of the body\r\nand with cross-bars on the limbs. The last two species and _N. fissipes_ of\r\nBrazil, near Pernambuco, carry their young in the pouch until the\r\nmetamorphosis is completed. This long nursing-period necessitates a great\r\namount of food-yolk in the eggs, and this enlargement in turn implies a\r\nconsiderable reduction in their number. The female's load consists of about\r\nfifteen eggs only, but these are of a great size, namely one-eighth of the\r\nlength of the mother's body.\r\n\r\n_N. pygmaeum_, in Venezuela, is a tiny creature. The female, just one inch\r\nin length, carries only from four to seven eggs. It looks then \"as if it\r\ncarried a sac filled with a few gigantic balls.\" This species is further\r\nworthy of note on account of the opening of the brood-pouch, which is a\r\nlongitudinal slit, whence a kind {203}of thin and slightly elevated ridge\r\nor fold of the skin extends on to the neck. The suggestion, that this seam\r\nis burst open, in order to set the full-grown young free, instead of their\r\npassing through the existing opening, is scarcely credible.\r\n\r\nThese Neotropical tree-frogs seem to be rare, and females with embryos are\r\nof course still more uncommon, so that the best account of their structure\r\nis still that given by Weinland[88] of _N. oviferum_. How the eggs get into\r\nthe pouch has not yet been observed, but it is most likely with the help of\r\nthe male, immediately after fertilisation. The pouch forms two blind sacs\r\nwhich extend forwards over the sides of the back. The eggs are large, 1 cm.\r\nin diameter, and the enclosed embryos, or rather tadpoles, had a length of\r\n15 mm., with a large amount of yolk still contained in the spirally wound\r\nintestine. The first two gill-arches carried each a double thread, which\r\nexpanded into a funnel-shaped membrane, not unlike the flower of a\r\n_Convolvulus_, and furnished with a capillary network; the stalk contained\r\nmuscular fibres. These most peculiar structures are of course the much\r\nmodified external gills. Those of _N. testudineum_ and _N. cornutum_ are\r\nlikewise bell-shaped.\r\n\r\n_Hylella_ differs from _Hyla_ chiefly by the absence of vomerine teeth, and\r\nconsists of about half-a-dozen small species, about one inch in length. The\r\nfact that two species live in Queensland and New Guinea, while the others\r\nare natives of tropical America, suggests that this genus is not a natural\r\nbut an artificial assembly, an instance of convergent evolution.\r\n\r\n_Phyllomedusa_, composed of about one dozen species of tree-frogs, is\r\ncharacterised by the vertically contracted pupil, large adhesive discs, and\r\nthe opposable nature of the inner finger and of the hallux, the last joints\r\nof which are like thumbs. The sacral diapophyses are strongly dilated. The\r\nrange of the genus extends from tropical Central America to Buenos Aires.\r\nMost of the species are about 2 inches in length, blue-green to violet\r\nabove, with white purple-edged patches on the sides of the body; the under\r\nparts uniform white, or with purple or brown patches. The male has a\r\nsubgular vocal sac. Some have more or less distinct parotoid glands. _Ph.\r\ndacnicolor_ of Mexico is uniform green above, whitish below, and attains a\r\nsize of more than 3 inches. In _Ph. bicolor_ of Brazil, the skin of the\r\nupper {204}parts is studded with calcareous deposits, and the parotoids are\r\nlarge. It is blue-green above, purplish white below, the sides of the body\r\nand limbs with white purple-edged spots.\r\n\r\n_Ph. hypochondrialis_ has been found breeding freely in the Paraguayan\r\nChaco by Budgett,[89] from whose account the following notes have been\r\nextracted. This brilliantly coloured frog is green above, which colour may\r\nbecome brown-grey or bluish at will; below, white and granular. The flanks\r\nare scarlet, with black transverse bars, and the plantar surfaces are deep\r\npurplish black. Total length about 1½ inch.\r\n\r\nThe \"Wollunnkukk,\" as it is called by the Indians, from the call of both\r\nmale and female at pairing time, is extremely slow in its movements, and is\r\nactive only at night. At this time, if it is seen by the aid of a lantern\r\nas it slowly climbs over the low bushes and grass, it is very conspicuous.\r\nIn the daytime, however, nothing is seen but the upper surface of the body\r\nas it lies on the green leaf of a plant. It has a remarkable power of\r\nchanging its colour to harmonise with its surroundings, and can effect a\r\nchange from the brightest green to light chocolate in a few minutes. The\r\nskin is also directly sensitive to light; for if the frog is exposed to the\r\nsun while in a tuft of grass in such a way that shadows of blades of grass\r\nfall across it, on removal it will be found that dark shadows of the\r\ngrasses remain on the skin, while the general colour has been raised to a\r\nlighter shade. Its food consists largely of young locusts. The ovaries on\r\neach side are divided into five distinct clusters. The rectum has a large\r\nsaccular diverticulum, which is very heavily pigmented.\r\n\r\nIn the breeding season–December to February–this beautiful frog collects in\r\nconsiderable numbers in the neighbourhood of pools. During the night-time\r\nthey call incessantly to one another, and produce a sound as of a dozen men\r\nbreaking stones, well imitated by the native name.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are enclosed in batches in leaves near the margin of the water.\r\nBudgett has been able to watch the whole process of oviposition and\r\nfertilisation. He found, at 11 P.M., a female carrying a male upon her\r\nback, wandering about in search of a suitable leaf. At last the female,\r\nclimbing up the stem of a plant near the water's edge, reached out and\r\ncaught hold of the {205}tip of an overhanging leaf, and climbed into it.\r\nBoth male and female held the edges of the leaf together, near the tip,\r\nwith their hind-legs, while the female poured her eggs into the funnel thus\r\nformed, the male fertilising them as they passed. The jelly in which the\r\neggs were laid was of sufficient firmness to hold the edges of the leaf\r\ntogether. Then moving up a little further, more eggs were laid in the same\r\nmanner, the edges of the leaf being fastened together by the hind-legs, and\r\nso on up the leaf until it was full. As a rule, two briar-leaves were\r\nfilled in this way, each containing about 100 eggs. The time occupied in\r\nfilling one leaf was three-quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\nDevelopment proceeds rapidly. Within six days the embryo increases from the\r\n2 mm. of the egg-diameter to 9 or 10 mm. When it leaves the leaf it is a\r\ntransparent glass-like tadpole, whose only conspicuous parts are the eyes.\r\nThese are very large and of a bright metallic green colour, so that when\r\nswimming in the water all that is seen is a pair of jewel-like eyes. The\r\nnewly-hatched tadpole has also a bright metallic spot between the nostrils\r\nsomewhat in front of the pineal spot. This is the point which touches the\r\nsurface of the water when the tadpole is in its favourite position. Whether\r\nit is a protective coloration, or some mechanical arrangement for holding\r\nthe surface, Budgett could not make out.\r\n\r\nThe egg contains a great amount of yolk; the rest of the jelly-like\r\ncontents of the egg becomes fluid, so that towards the end of embryonic\r\nlife the larva comes to lie quite freely within a membranous capsule. The\r\nexternal gills appear on the third day, and reach their greatest size on\r\nthe fifth, when these bright red filamentous organs extend beyond the vent.\r\nBy the time the tadpoles are ready to be hatched these gills have quite\r\ndisappeared, there is a median spiracle, and the lungs are shining through\r\nthe transparent body-wall. Five weeks later, _i.e._ six weeks after the\r\neggs were laid, the tadpole is 8 cm. long, glossy green above, rosy and\r\nsilvery below, and the hind-limbs protrude. The young frog at the close of\r\nits metamorphosis is two-thirds the length of the adult, and at this time\r\nacquires the red flanks barred with black.\r\n\r\nThe first account of the breeding of _Phyllomedusa_ was given by v.\r\nIhering[90] concerning _Ph. iheringi_ of Southern Brazil.\r\n\r\n{206}\"_Phyllomedusa_ does not lay its eggs in the water, although the larva\r\ndevelops in that element, but in the open air in masses 50 millim. long by\r\n15-20 broad, between leaves hanging over the water. Willows are frequently\r\nused for that purpose. The egg-mass contains rather large white ova,\r\nwrapped up between two or three leaves in such a way as to be completely\r\nenveloped save an inferior opening. My attempts at rearing the eggs failed\r\nowing to the leaves drying up; but I am assured that the tailed larvae may\r\nbe seen wriggling in the gelatinous mass. As at a later period the latter\r\nis found empty, we must infer that the larvae drop into the water below.\r\nThe eggs are found only on plants hanging over stagnant water.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.–A branch with eggs of _Phyllomedusa iheringi_, × 1,\r\nenveloped in the leaves. (After v. Ihering.)]\r\n\r\n\"The adult animal is a stupid creature, and will let itself be taken\r\nwithout attempting to escape. Their moderately loud voice resembles\r\nsomewhat the sound produced by running the finger nail over the teeth of a\r\ncomb. Only during the breeding season, in the month of January in Rio\r\nGrande do Sul, do these frogs make their appearance; at other times not one\r\nis to be seen, probably because they establish themselves high up in the\r\ntrees.\"\r\n\r\n_Agalychnis_, with two species in Central America, is practically like\r\n_Hyla_; but the pupil is vertical, and the tongue is extensively free\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n_Nyctimantis_ differs from either by its round tongue, which is not nicked\r\nbehind, and is almost completely adherent, much resembling that of the\r\nDiscoglossidae. The sacral diapophyses are but slightly dilated. The only\r\nspecies, _N. rugiceps_, lives in Ecuador, and grows to nearly three inches\r\nin length. The head is large and rough owing to the skin being involved in\r\nthe cranial ossification. It is further peculiar in its coloration, the\r\nunder parts being chestnut-brown instead of whitish. The upper parts are\r\nolive-grey or brown.\r\n\r\nThe following four genera, each represented by one or two species\r\n{207}only, much resemble each other in the curious shape of the head, which\r\nforms a flat projecting snout, used probably for digging in rotten wood in\r\nsearch of insects. There is a peculiar degradation in the extent of\r\ndentition of the palatal region. _Diaglena_ and _Triprion_ are the only\r\nHylidae which possess a longitudinal row of parasphenoid teeth. _Diaglena\r\npetasata_ of Mexico and _D. jordani_ of Ecuador have, moreover, a\r\ntransverse row of teeth on the palatine bones in addition to those on the\r\nvomer.\r\n\r\n_Triprion petasatus_ of Yucatan has parasphenoid and vomerine teeth. The\r\nhead is a bony casque, with strong superciliary ridges, the skin being\r\nextensively ossified. The mouth forms a flat snout, owing to the long\r\nprojection of the upper over the lower jaw. The skin of the back is smooth\r\nbrown with darker spots; the under parts are uniform whitish. The male has\r\na subgular vocal sac. Like _Diaglena_ and _Corythomantis_ they possess\r\nadhesive discs on the fingers and toes, and climb trees. The total length\r\nof this curious creature is 2 inches.\r\n\r\n_Corythomantis greeningi_ of Brazil has a similar head. The vomers alone\r\ncarry teeth, besides of course the maxillae. The pupil is rhomboid. The\r\ntongue, as in the two previous genera, is roundish, scarcely free. General\r\ncolour above olive, with darker freckles; the sides are studded with\r\nwhitish tubercles; the under parts are whitish. The male is devoid of vocal\r\nsacs. Total length 3 inches.\r\n\r\n_Pternohyla fodiens_ of Mexico approaches the previous three genera by the\r\ncurious shape of the head and prominent upper jaw, although these features\r\nare not so exaggerated. The dentition agrees with that of _Corythomantis_\r\nand other normal tree-frogs. The fingers and toes are not provided with\r\ndiscs, in conformity with the burrowing, not climbing, habits of this\r\ncreature. The next following three genera connect the Hylidae with the\r\nCystignathidae. The sacral vertebrae are but slightly dilated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.–Head of _Corythomantis greeningi_. × 1. (After\r\nBoulenger, _Cat. Batrach._)]\r\n\r\n_Acris._–The adhesive discs are very small, the tympanum is indistinct. _A.\r\ngryllus_, the only species, inhabits the greater part of Eastern and\r\nCentral North America, extending northwards into Canada. It attains a\r\nlength of 1½ inch. The coloration is very changeable, in adaptation to the\r\nsurroundings. As {208}a rule it is brown, with a more or less reddish or\r\ngrey ground-tone, ornamented with dark brown or blackish irregular,\r\nlongitudinal patches,one of which is bordered with light green,and there is\r\noften a light vertebral streak. The legs are cross-barred, the under parts\r\nare whitish brown and yellowish. The male has a subgular vocal sac, and its\r\nmost remarkable feature is the voice, which closely resembles the noise of\r\na cricket or of certain grasshoppers. Holbrook describes it as a merry\r\nlittle frog, constantly chirping like a cricket, even in confinement. It\r\nfrequents the borders of pools, and is often found on the leaves of aquatic\r\nplants, rarely on the branches of such low shrubs as overhang or dip into\r\nthe water. When disturbed it takes long jumps, and hides at the bottom of\r\nthe pond. Insects are secured by leaps. It can easily be domesticated, and\r\ntakes food readily from the hand. Sprinkling them with water never fails to\r\nmake them more lively and noisy. Appearing in April in great numbers, they\r\nare said to vanish early in the autumn for hibernation. The tadpoles are\r\nmetamorphosed by the end of August.\r\n\r\n_Chorophilus._–The fingers and toes are provided with very small adhesive\r\ndiscs. The sacral diapophyses are very slightly dilated. About seven\r\nspecies occur in North America, chiefly in the Southern States, one, _Ch.\r\ncuzcanus_, in Peru. _Ch. ocularis_ is the smallest of the frog-kind known,\r\nand lives in South Carolina, frequenting damp places, the vicinity of\r\nstagnant pools, water-plants or low shrubs, for instance the \"myrtle,\"\r\n_Myrica cerifera_. I once had two of these tiny creatures less than\r\nthree-quarters of an inch in length. They were very active, and took\r\nsurprisingly long leaps, jumping distances of 2 feet, but could not be kept\r\nthrough the winter, although they took minute insects readily enough. The\r\nhead is narrow, long and pointed; the upper parts are of a rich\r\nchestnut-brown with a bronzy gloss. The upper jaw is white; a black band\r\nextends along the sides of the head and body. The under parts are yellowish\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n_Ch. ornatus_ is another inhabitant of the South-Eastern States; its name\r\nrefers to the dark brown patches on the back and sides, bordered with\r\ngolden yellow, upon a reddish-brown ground-tone, while the under parts are\r\nsilvery white with fine grey spots. This frog, a little more than one inch\r\nin length, lives on land in dry places, preferably in corn-fields, has no\r\nvoice, and, except during the pairing season, carefully avoids the water.\r\n\r\n{209}_Thoropa._–The fingers and toes are free, the tips simply swollen and\r\nnot dilated into discs. Closely allied to _Chorophilus_. _Th. miliaris_, of\r\nBrazil, the only species, has very long toes. The head is broad and flat.\r\nThe upper, nearly smooth surface of the body is flesh-coloured, with brown\r\nmarblings; the limbs are cross-barred; the under parts whitish, granular on\r\nthe belly. The male is devoid of vocal sacs. The total length may be 2\r\ninches. Hensel has published the following notes of this species, under the\r\nname of _Hylodes abbreviatus_. The tadpoles are quite flat, their bellies\r\nforming a kind of sucking disc, so that these creatures, even before the\r\nappearance of the hind-limbs, can quickly wriggle up vertical walls of\r\nstones, provided these are covered with a little water. In correlation with\r\nthis habit, the root of the tail is not compressed laterally, but is as\r\nbroad as it is high, and the usual vertical fin is restricted to its distal\r\nthird. On the proximal portion of the tail the ventral fin is flattened and\r\nbroadened out so as to form almost the continuation of the peculiar\r\ndisc-like belly. The anal opening is not a projecting tube, but is a\r\nflattened transverse slit.\r\n\r\nFAM. 5. CYSTIGNATHIDAE.–This is one of the largest families, and also one\r\nof the least satisfactory. Its numerous members, more than 150, exhibit\r\nsuch a versatility in adaptation to circumstances (there are aquatic,\r\nterrestrial, arboreal, and burrowing species), with a corresponding\r\ndevelopment or loss of anatomical characters which we should like to rely\r\nupon as taxonomic marks, that the numerous genera not only run into each\r\nother, but also get entangled with those of other families. In fact the\r\nwhole family is ill defined. It can be characterised as follows:–The\r\nshoulder-girdle is arciferous; the sacral diapophyses are cylindrical or\r\nbut slightly dilated; the metasternum has either a bony style or it forms a\r\ncartilaginous plate; the terminal phalanges, although they sometimes carry\r\nadhesive discs, are never claw-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe last statement is, of course, intended to separate the Cystignathidae\r\nfrom the Hylidae, of which, however, the three genera _Thoropa_,\r\n_Chorophilus_, and _Acris_ stand on debatable ground (cf. p. 186, Hylidae),\r\nwhile, on the other hand, most of the Australian genera, notably\r\n_Chiroleptes_, have unmistakably dilated sacral diapophyses. The difference\r\nfrom the Pelobatidae can in this case be one of degree only.\r\n\r\n{210}The Cystignathidae may be said to represent the Ranidae in Notogaea.\r\nSome of them can be distinguished from the true, typical frogs solely by\r\nthe arciferous type of the shoulder-girdle and sternum. There is in both\r\nfamilies the same adaptive versatility, the same amplitude in the formation\r\nof the fingertips, the occasional slight dilatation of the sacral\r\ndiapophyses, the same range in the configuration of the omo- and\r\nmeta-sternum. In fact, young Ranidae, before the firmisternal character is\r\nassumed, are indistinguishable from Cystignathidae, and the latter would\r\nturn into Ranidae if they could be induced to consolidate their sternal\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of the Cystignathidae is suggestive of their\r\nbeing an old family, most of whose members have reached a high stage of\r\nmorphological development. The overwhelming majority inhabit the\r\nNeotropical region, a few forms extending into tropical Central America and\r\ninto the Antilles; the rest, some twenty species only, are confined to the\r\nContinent of Australia and to Tasmania.\r\n\r\nThe family name is rather a misnomer. It is taken from the genus\r\n_Cystignathus_, which is, or rather was, characterised by the peculiarly\r\nbroadened lower jaw, hollowed out by the vocal sacs; but this generic name\r\nhad to give way to that of _Leptodactylus_, in obedience to the often\r\nsenseless rule of priority. The family is composed of three subfamilies.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. HEMIPHRACTINAE.–Teeth are carried by both jaws, the vomers and\r\nthe palatine bones; or by the palatines and parasphenoids in _Amphodus_.\r\nThe vertebrae are opisthocoelous, devoid of ribs, and the sacral\r\ndiapophyses are not dilated. The shoulder-girdle and sternum are strictly\r\narciferous. The omosternum is very much reduced; the metasternum forms a\r\ncartilaginous plate. The tongue is slightly free behind. The tympanum is\r\ndistinct. Three genera, with eight species, all inhabitants of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n_Hemiphractus._–The head is large; the upper surface of all the cranial\r\nbones appears pitted, owing to most of the covering skin being involved in\r\nthe ossification. The temporal fossa is bridged over or roofed in by the\r\nfronto-parietal and the squamosals, so that the orbit is completely\r\nencircled by bone, as in _Pelobates cultripes_. The terminal phalanges are\r\nsimple and are not dilated into discs. The teeth of the lower jaw are\r\n{211}very small and numerous. The tongue is round and very small. _H.\r\nscutatus_, the only species, living in Ecuador and Colombia, is a frog-like\r\ncreature, with a large helmet-shaped head. Total length 2½ inches.\r\n\r\n_Ceratohyla_ has the same kind of helmet-shaped head, and the orbit is\r\nlikewise enclosed by bone, but the terminal phalanges are claw-shaped and\r\ncarry regular adhesive discs. This genus, the five species of which live in\r\nEcuador, bears undoubted resemblances to the Hylidae. In _C. proboscidea_\r\nthe upper eyelid is produced into a little upright fold, as in\r\n_Amphignathodon_ and some species of _Nototrema_ and _Ceratophrys_ among\r\nCystignathidae. The snout is produced into a long, compressed, bifid\r\nappendage, and the heel carries a triangular flap. In _C. bubalus_ the\r\npartly ossified helmet sends out a pair of diverging processes, formed by\r\nthe squamosals, extending backwards and sideways from the concave and\r\nridged interorbital spaces. The tip of the snout and the tips of the\r\ndivergent horns form an equilateral triangle, and the whole head bears a\r\nstriking resemblance to some of the fossil Reptiles from the Elgin\r\nSandstone, e.g. _Triceratops_. Total length 3 inches.\r\n\r\n_Amphodus wucheri._–The only species of this genus has been found near\r\nBahia. It has teeth on the palatine bones and five series of small teeth on\r\nthe parasphenoid, but none on the vomers. The teeth of the mandible number\r\nabout eleven on each side and decrease in size towards the symphysis. The\r\ntympanum is distinct; the heart-shaped tongue is free behind. The cranial\r\nbones are only slightly pitted. The skin is smooth above, chocolate-brown,\r\nspotted with yellow, and with a yellow band on the sides of the body\r\nbeginning with the upper eyelid and ending in a broad patch above the vent.\r\nThe under parts are yellowish white.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. CYSTIGNATHINAE.–The upper jaw alone is provided with teeth.\r\nVertebrae procoelous. The twenty-seven genera of this sub-family have been\r\narranged in the following key, merely for convenient determination.\r\n\r\n  I.

The fingers, of which the\r\nfirst is opposed to the others, are free; the long toes are fully webbed.\r\nThe tympanum is exposed.\r\n\r\n_P. paradoxa_ is absolutely aquatic, floating in pools, and is extremely\r\nshy. In life it is most beautifully coloured with bronze, bright green, and\r\nblack markings above; underneath it is shiny yellow, with brown spots on\r\nthe body and stripes on the thighs. Within a few minutes after death all\r\nthe brilliant colours of the smooth skin of the back turn into dull uniform\r\nbrown, with indistinct darker spots. Total length of the adult from 2 to 2½\r\ninches. The specific name refers to the peculiar shape and monstrous size\r\nof the larva or tadpole.\r\n\r\nOne of the larvae described and figured by Parker measures 10⅓ inches in\r\nlength, the head and body taking up 3⅓ inches. The spiracle lies on the\r\nleft side and the hind legs are ½ inch long, just breaking through the\r\nskin. The vent is median. The huge tail is very thick and muscular, and is\r\nfurnished with a high, irregularly shaped dorsal and ventral fin, the whole\r\norgan measuring 4 inches dorso-ventrally. Another larva, or rather tadpole,\r\nin the national collection is older, and although still very large, namely,\r\n7 inches long, has fully developed hind-limbs 3 inches long; the fore-limbs\r\nare less than half that size, the left protrudes through the spiracle,\r\nwhile the right has broken through the skin. The dorsal and ventral fins of\r\nthe tail have much shrunk; the whole organ, 5 inches long, is gradually\r\ntapering to a point like the tail of ordinary tadpoles. By the time that\r\nthe {214}tadpole is nearly ready to leave the water, its whole bulk is\r\nreduced to less than one-fifth that of the largest tadpole. It measures\r\nfrom snout to vent only 1½ inch (in the 7-inch tadpole this distance is\r\nfully 2 inches), and the tail, devoid of fins, is reduced to 2 inches in\r\nlength. Instead of the solitary left spiracle there are now two, one on the\r\nventral side and a little in front of the base of each arm, the border of\r\neach hole being continued by a peculiar semilunar fold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.–_Hylodes martinicensis._ 1, an egg with embryo\r\nabout seven days old; 2, another, twelve days old; 3, the young Frog just\r\nhatched; all × ¾; 4, adult male × 1. (After Peters.)]\r\n\r\n_Hylodes._–The numerous species, nearly fifty, of this tropical American\r\ngenus exhibit several anatomical differences.  The tympanum is sometimes\r\nindistinct or hidden, in which case the Eustachian tubes are generally very\r\nnarrow. The fingers are free, and carry discs, like the toes, which are\r\nsometimes slightly webbed. The males have a subgular vocal sac, producing a\r\nloud, or whistling, voice. The general appearance is that of land- and\r\ntree-frogs; the size is small, mostly between 1 and 2 inches.\r\n\r\n_H. martinicensis_ is about 1½ inch in length. The ground-colour is pale\r\nyellow-grey, with a large brown patch on the nape, which colour is\r\ncontinued over the back in the shape of more or less coherent or dissolved\r\npatches. A dark brown stripe runs along the middle of the sides. The limbs\r\nare barred with brown, the under parts are whitish. This species, known by\r\nthe vernacular name of \"_coqui_\" inhabits many of the West Indian islands,\r\n_e.g._ Barbadoes, Martinique, Porto Rico, and Hayti. It has become famous,\r\nas it was the first instance known of a frog which undergoes its whole\r\nmetamorphosis within the egg. The pairing takes place on land, in the\r\nmonths of May and June, when the female lays about twenty eggs, which are\r\nenveloped in a foamy mass and glued on to a broad leaf, or hidden in the\r\naxillae of Iridaceous plants. The mother seems to remain in the\r\nneighbourhood watching the eggs, which are {215}large, measuring 4-5 mm. in\r\ndiameter. Dr. Gundlach, a resident in Porto Rico, was one day, in the month\r\nof May, attracted by sounds like those of a young bird, and found three\r\nmales and one female of this species sitting between two large leaves of an\r\norange-tree. He put them all into a glass vessel and soon saw a pair in\r\nembrace. The female laid about twenty-five pale straw-coloured eggs. The\r\nembryo develops neither gills nor gill-openings, but a large\r\nwell-vascularised tail, by means of which, being immersed in the watery\r\nfluid contained within the egg, it seems to breathe. After twenty-one days\r\nthe tadpole, having used up all the available yolk and fluid, and most of\r\nits own tail, bursts the egg-shell and hops away as a little frog of 5 mm.\r\nin length, but still with a stumpy white tail, which is quite absorbed\r\nwithin the same day.\r\n\r\nThis species has several times made its appearance in the tropical houses\r\nof Kew Gardens. It seems to have bred and vanished again.[92]\r\n\r\n_Calyptocephalus_ is remarkable for the dermal ossification of the cranium,\r\nwhich has assumed the greatest possible extent. It affords a curious\r\nparallelism to _Triprion_ and other Hylidae, which are likewise Central\r\nAmerican forms. Only two species are known; _C. gayi_ of Chili, and _C.\r\ntestudiniceps_ of Panama. They are large, thoroughly aquatic creatures, 5\r\nto 6 inches in length, with huge heads. The tadpoles grow to an enormous\r\nsize. One specimen of _C. gayi_ in the National Collection is more than 6\r\ninches in length, the tail taking up more than half of the total: the\r\nspiracle lies on the left side, the vent on the right, and the hind-limbs\r\nare still half enveloped in a kind of fold of the skin.\r\n\r\n_Ceratophrys_ is a genus of some ten toad-like species, living in South\r\nAmerica, from Guiana to Argentina. The generic name alludes to the peculiar\r\nmodification of the eyelid, which in most species is developed into a\r\ntriangular, upright, but flexible appendage. The head, in conformity with\r\nthe huge mouth, is very large. The tympanum is rather indistinct, sometimes\r\nquite hidden. Several of the species have a large dorsal shield, which is\r\nproduced by a thick ossification of the cutis, but is not fused with any of\r\nthe vertebral processes. The male has a vocal sac. _C. dorsata_ s. _boiei_\r\nof equatorial Brazil is a monster toad, reaching {216}a length of 6 inches.\r\nThe upper eyelid is transformed into a triangular horn, whence a cutaneous\r\nridge extends all along the side of the back, meeting that of the other\r\nside above the vent. There is no osseous shield on the back. The tympanum\r\nis hidden. Ground-colours, orange or green, with sharply marked dark brown\r\nor blackish patches.\r\n\r\n_C. cornuta_, in Northern Brazil, lacks the dorsal shield, but has horned\r\neyelids and a visible tympanum. Its coloration renders it one of the most\r\nbeautiful toad-like creatures known. The ground-colours are green, black\r\nand brown, with an orange-yellow stripe over the head and back. All these\r\ncolours are most pleasingly blended and arranged in marbled patches or\r\nstripes radiating from various centres, as, for instance, from the eyes\r\ntowards the circumference of the mouth, the slit of which they pass, the\r\nsame line of the pattern being continued upon the lower jaw. The whole\r\nsurface makes the impression of a gay but exquisitely harmonious carpet.\r\nThe under parts are yellow, inclining to white towards the middle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.–_Ceratophrys ornata._ Horned Toad.  × ¾.]\r\n\r\n_C. ornata_ has a dorsal shield. The tympanum is just visible, and the\r\neyelids form only low but sharp-edged projections. This is likewise a\r\nbeautiful toad, living chiefly in Uruguay, Northern Argentina, and\r\nParaguay, where it is universally known as the \"escuerzo,\" one of the\r\nSpanish words signifying a toad. Its size rarely surpasses 4½ inches. The\r\nground-colours are greenish and yellow, with large dark green patches on\r\nthe back, decreasing in size on the flanks.\r\n\r\n{217}[Illustration: FIG. 44.–_Ceratophrys ornata._ (From _Nature_.)]\r\n\r\nEach of these insular patches is surrounded by a narrow line of white and\r\nyellow dots, interspersed here and there with lines of rusty brown or red.\r\nThe object of this elaborate carpet-like pattern is concealment. These\r\ntoads–and this applies to all the species,–bury themselves half in the\r\nground, preferably in the grass, where they are well-nigh invisible. If\r\nthere is not enough green vegetation, they throw, with their feet, little\r\nlumps of earth upon their backs, the skin of which becomes at the same time\r\nmore crinkled and assumes duller tones. There the creature lies, perfectly\r\nconcealed, betrayed only by the metallic glittering eyes, waiting for some\r\nunfortunate creature to pass into the trap represented by the enormous\r\nmouth, which opens and shuts with lightning-rapidity and with an audible\r\nsnap. They seem to live chiefly on frogs, and sometimes they turn\r\ncannibals. Two specimens were brought over to me from Buenos Aires by a\r\nfriend, in a well-closed basket with moist soil at the bottom, but only one\r\nwas visible on arrival. The other was inside the {218}larger one, and could\r\nstill be felt through the soft body. This same cannibal took large-sized\r\nfrogs greedily, one or two for a meal, swallowing them whole and then\r\nsinking back into its lair, which it scarcely ever left, except for an\r\noccasional soaking bath in its water-pan, especially before shedding its\r\nskin. It lived for many months in the same enclosure with a pantherine\r\ntoad, _Bufo mauritanica_, of equal bulk, until one morning I found the\r\nMoroccan half swallowed and almost lifeless in the mouth of the American,\r\nwhence it was rescued with difficulty. It came round after a few hours, but\r\nnever fully recovered, lingering on for weeks; the skin was changed to a\r\nlead-colour so far as it had been swallowed and partly dissolved by the\r\ngastric juices, and soon began to develop festering ulcers.\r\n\r\nThese \"horned toads\" make a squeaking noise when teazed, not at all loud or\r\nstrong in proportion to their size. Ill-tempered individuals jump at their\r\naggressor and can inflict rather painful nips. They hibernate during the\r\ndry season in the ground.\r\n\r\n_Lepidobatrachus._–Large teeth in the upper jaw, and two large tooth-like\r\nprojections in the lower jaw near the symphysis. Vomer toothless. Sacral\r\ndiapophyses not dilated. Tongue round, and free behind. Tympanum distinct.\r\nGreat development of the membrane-bones on the head, and a weaker\r\nossification in the skin of the back, recalling that in _Ceratophrys_. The\r\neyes are closely set together, and the nostrils take up the most elevated\r\nportion of the head. Pupil horizontal. The two species of this genus were\r\ndiscovered by Budgett[93] in the Paraguayan Chaco. _L. asper_ lives\r\ncontinually in muddy pools, floating with just the eyes and nostrils above\r\nthe surface. If disturbed it slowly sinks to the bottom, leaving no ripple.\r\nIt feeds largely on _Bufo granulosus_. Total length from about 3 inches.\r\nThe skin of the upper parts is tubercular, tough, and of a dull leaden\r\ncolour; the tips of the toes are horny. _L. laevis_ is smooth and slimy,\r\n\"with the organs of the lateral line showing clearly upon it,\" a feature\r\nelsewhere known to exist in _Xenopus_ and _Leptobrachium_ only.\r\n\r\n_Leptodactylus_ = _Cystignathus_.–Some twenty species inhabit tropical\r\nAmerica, from Central Mexico to Buenos Aires. The fingers and toes are not\r\nwebbed and end mostly in points; only a few species, e.g. _L.\r\nhylaeodactylus_, having small adhesive discs. {219}The legs are long and\r\nthe general appearance is very much like that of an ordinary frog.\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest and prettiest Brazilian species is _L. ocellatus_,\r\nwhich is characterised by a number of longitudinal glandular folds on the\r\nback and flanks. The colour of the upper parts is olive-brown, that of the\r\nprominent folds is yellowish white, interspersed with black spots. The\r\nunder parts are yellowish white, with blackish marblings on the throat. The\r\nmales have a sharp black spur on the inner carpal edge and one on the\r\nrudiment of the thumb. Total length about 4 inches.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hensel[94] the spawning takes place in Rio Grande do Sul after\r\nhibernation. The voice of the male is then very loud, resembling the sound\r\nmade by a carpenter chopping a beam. They repair to ponds and produce a\r\ncup-shaped puddle, about 1 foot in width, by raising a wall of mud, which\r\nseparates the inner water from that of the pond. The tadpoles remain in\r\nthis nursery until the spring-rains demolish it and set the young ones\r\nfree. Drought causes the drying up of these water-pans and subsequent\r\ndestruction of the brood.\r\n\r\n_L. mystacinus_ is another Brazilian species, about 2 inches in length. Its\r\nspecific name refers to the dark brown stripe which runs from the tip of\r\nthe mouth through the eye to the tympanum. This species is thoroughly\r\nterrestrial, and never enters the water. It digs a cavity, the size of an\r\nordinary tea-cup, under stones or rotten trunks, always in the\r\nneighbourhood of ponds and just so high above the water that the latter can\r\nrise up to the nest in the rainy reason. The straw-coloured eggs are laid\r\nin this cavity, and are enveloped in a foamy, sticky mass, like the\r\nwell-beaten white of an egg. The young tadpoles seem to live on this froth\r\nuntil the rains set them free. When, however, the rains delay and a drought\r\nkills the broods of other less circumspect species, these tadpoles, still\r\nprovided with gills and long tails, remain in their moist nest or withdraw\r\nfurther beneath the rotten stumps, huddled together in large numbers until\r\nthe next rainy season.\r\n\r\nSimilar nursing habits have been recorded of _L. albilabris_, which\r\ninhabits Mexico, Cuba, and several other West Indian islands. The same\r\napplies to _L. typhonius_. Gundlach found eggs {220}of this \"Sapo\" in\r\nPuerto Rico on the 4th of November; on the 25th the young showed the first\r\nsigns of hind-limbs, on the 3rd of December of fore-limbs, and on the 7th\r\nof the same month they began to climb out of the water.\r\n\r\n_Paludicola_ is a semi-aquatic genus with some eighteen species, ranging\r\nfrom Mexico to Patagonia and across the Andes into Chili. Some of them have\r\na peculiar gland on the lumbar region, or large, flat warts on the back,\r\nsometimes arranged in longitudinal folds. The toes are slightly webbed, or\r\nfree, according to the more or less pronounced aquatic habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.–_Paludicola fuscomaculata_, × 1, with vocal sacs\r\npartly filled.]\r\n\r\n_P. fuscomaculata_, an inhabitant of Southern Brazil, Paraguay, and\r\nUruguay, is a short-limbed frog, with spreading slender toes and a small\r\nhead. There are shovel-shaped, black, horny tubercles on the metatarsus.\r\nThe general colour is olive above, with darker markings and confluent\r\nwhite-edged spots; the limbs are cross-barred; the lumbar glands are black,\r\nwith a white margin in front. The male has a vocal sac. Budgett[95] gives\r\nthe following account of its habits:–\r\n\r\nThe peculiar cry, which is so constantly heard in the neighbourhood of\r\nshallow pools in the Paraguayan Chaco, and resembles that of a kitten, is\r\nproduced by the alternate inflation of throat and abdomen. When fully\r\ninflated, the frog appears to be the size of a golf-ball, but, if startled,\r\ninstantaneously shrinks to one-fifth of that size, so that it seems to have\r\nvanished. It has also the power of ventriloquising. The food consists\r\nlargely of water-beetles. In the spawning time it was found at night\r\nfloating on the surface of pools in the distended condition, and crying to\r\nthe females in a most mournful way. On coming to the surface it fills its\r\nlungs with a few gasps, greatly distending the walls of the abdomen, and\r\nthen drives the air into the vocal sacs, causing them to become distended\r\nas the body collapses, and giving rise to a kitten-like cry.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are chiefly laid in January, and are found embedded {221}in a\r\nfrothy mass floating upon the surface of the water. The eggs measure only 1\r\nmm. and are without pigment, and with extremely little yolk. The larvae\r\nbecome free-swimming within from eighteen to twenty-four hours after the\r\nfirst segmentation. When ready for hatching they wriggle their way through\r\nthe froth to the water below, and hang into it from the floating froth.\r\n\r\n_P. biligonigera_ s. _notata_, in Brazil, lacks the lumbar gland, the place\r\nof which is marked by a black spot. The upper parts are olive, with darker\r\nmarblings and a dark lateral stripe. The male has a black throat and two\r\nexternal vocal sacs. Hensel found the eggs, in Rio Grande do Sul, in\r\nSeptember, forming a frothy mass of the size of a fist, floating between\r\ngrass upon the water near the margin.\r\n\r\nThe following three genera may serve as Australian examples, especially\r\nsince we are indebted to Baldwin Spencer for interesting observations made\r\non their habits in Central Australia.[96]\r\n\r\n_Chiroleptes_, of which six species are known, is easily recognised by the\r\nfirst finger, which is opposed to the others. The sacral diapophyses are\r\nslightly dilated. The general shape is that of a thick-headed, rather stout\r\nland-frog or of a tree-frog. The tympanum is distinct, and the toes are\r\nonly half webbed, or even less, except in _Ch. platycephalus_, in which the\r\ntoes are entirely webbed and the tympanum is indistinct. This species is\r\nabout 2 inches long, uniformly olive-green above, with a few tubercles on\r\nthe otherwise smooth skin. Other species rather resemble the European\r\nNatterjack in coloration.\r\n\r\nSpencer's account is as follows:–\"In Central Australia _Ch. platycephalus_\r\nseems to prefer the hard clay pans rather than sandy creeks, as the\r\nsand-beds of the latter are too loose for the formation of the burrow. We\r\ncame across the animal first when encamped by the side of a very shallow\r\nclay pan, the floor of which was deeply cracked with the sun's heat. Around\r\nthe edge were withered shrubs of _Chenopodium nitrariaceum_, and it was at\r\nthe base of these that the black fellows looked for the burrow. In the\r\nhard-baked clay were imprints made by the frog as it burrowed, and about a\r\nfoot underground we came across the animal, puffed out into a spherical\r\nshape, and just filling up a cavity, the walls of which were moist but not\r\nwet. The ground {222}was so hard that it had to be chipped away. When one\r\nside of the burrow was opened, the frog remained perfectly still; its lower\r\neyelid was drawn up over the eye and was very opaque, giving rise to the\r\nbelief amongst the blacks that the animal is blind. In the sunlight, after\r\na short time, it opened its eyes.\r\n\r\n\"On squeezing the body, water was forced out of the cloaca; this was\r\naccumulated principally in the urinary bladder. On cutting the body open it\r\nwas seen that there was a certain amount of water in the subcutaneous\r\nspaces, but that the greater portion, which caused the great swelling-out\r\nof the body, was contained in the body-cavity itself; and it was also\r\nobserved that the lungs were considerably distended and lengthened, their\r\napices lying right in the pelvic region. They contained air and not water,\r\nbut their outer faces were bathed with the water in the body-cavity.\" The\r\nlarvae and tadpoles probably develop with extreme rapidity, soon to\r\naestivate as very small frogs.\r\n\r\n_Heleioporus_ has a calcified metasternal plate and slightly dilated sacral\r\nvertebrae. The two species have a toad-like appearance, owing to their\r\nstout bodies, short limbs and conspicuous parotoid glands. _H.\r\nalbopunctatus_ is mottled whitish red and brown above; it extends from\r\nWestern into Central Australia. _H. pictus_ is olive, with darker\r\nmarblings, and is distinguished by a light vertebral line. It is likewise\r\nfound in Central Australia, and it extends into Victoria and New South\r\nWales. Spencer found it in swarms after heavy rains, the specimens being\r\nmuch swollen and distended with caterpillars and beetles. They looked as if\r\nthey were simply gorging themselves with food preparatory to returning\r\nagain to their long aestivating condition.\r\n\r\n_Limnodynastes_ is one of the commonest genera in Australia. The six\r\nspecies have the habits and appearance of stout frogs or smooth toads. _L.\r\ndorsalis_ seems to range through the whole of Australia, from east to west,\r\nand looks like the European _Pelobates_. The skin is smooth, but with an\r\nelongated white gland extending from beneath the eye to the shoulder, and\r\nanother glandular complex on the thigh. The upper parts are mottled\r\nolive-brown, often with a light vertebral line. The under parts are\r\nwhitish, with brown spots. The male has a vocal sac. One of the specimens\r\nin the National Collection contained a half-grown _Heleioporus\r\nalbopunctatus_ in its stomach.\r\n\r\n{223}Concerning the pairing and the other habits of the Anura of New South\r\nWales we have some valuable notes by J. J. Fletcher.[97] He observes that\r\nAustralian frogs spawn whenever they are ready, and when the very irregular\r\nconditions of moisture will allow it, but that they are not all ready at\r\nthe same time, _i.e._ they have no fixed period of the year.\r\n_Limnodynastes_, _Hyla aurea_, and _H. coerulea_ deposit their spawn in the\r\nwater, in more or less irregular floating patches, which look white and\r\nfrothy. The period extends from July to May, and is at its height in August\r\nand September; but if there is a spring-drought vigorous spawning may be\r\nlooked for about the middle of January, when heavy showers are likely to\r\noccur. _Crinia_ and several _Hyla_, e.g. _H. ewingi_, spawn at any time of\r\nthe year. The eggs form small submerged bunches, enclosed in a transparent\r\njelly, attached to the blades of grass or twigs of dead branches in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n_Pseudophryne_, a genus closely resembling _Crinia_, but on account of the\r\nabsence of teeth in the lower jaw relegated to the Bufonidae, spawns during\r\nthe Australian summer and autumn. The numerous ova of _P. australis_ and\r\n_P. bibroni_ are laid separately, not in the water, but under stones, or in\r\nthe débris of reed- and grass-tussocks, on the edge of a pool.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of _Pseudophryne_ and others have often to depend upon the next\r\nfollowing rain, sometimes waiting for months to be released from the eggs,\r\nwherein they have so far developed. But the tadpoles, once hatched,\r\nprobably do not bury themselves; they either metamorphose or die.\r\n\r\nThe males of _Mixophyes_ and _Hyla_, grasp the females in the axillary\r\nregion; those of _Limnodynastes_, _Hyperolia_, _Crinia_, and _Pseudophryne_\r\nthrow their arms round the inguinal or lumbar region.\r\n\r\nFor some three months during the winter, commencing about May, the frogs,\r\nlike lizards and snakes, resort to shelter under logs and stones, beneath\r\nwhich they are then to be met with in a more or less sleepy condition.\r\nDuring the hot and very dry periods many bury themselves in the drying-up\r\nmud, which becomes very hard, and does not release them until the next\r\nrains. They croak during showery times of the year. There is no evidence\r\nthat any Australian species live in the high _Eucalyptus_-trees.\r\n\r\n{224}_Hylopsis platycephalus_, of South America, is of importance as\r\nforming a link with the Dendrophryniscinae, owing to the very small size of\r\nthe teeth in the upper jaw. There are no vomerine teeth. The fingers and\r\ntoes are webbed, and furnished with discs. The very small omosternum and\r\nthe metasternum are cartilaginous. The pupil is horizontal. Total length,\r\nabout or under 1½ inch.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 3. DENDROPHRYNISCINAE.–The two Neotropical genera of this\r\nsub-family are characterised by the entire absence of teeth. The toothless\r\ncondition of the upper jaw is really the sole character which separates\r\nthem from the Cystignathinae, taken as a whole. The suppression of the\r\ntympanum and of the Eustachian tubes in _Batrachophrynus_, and the fully\r\nwebbed toes of _B. macrostomus_ indicate complete adaptation to aquatic\r\nlife. The absence of the omosternum in _Dendrophryniscus_, the absence of\r\nvomerine teeth, the dilated phalangeal tips, the entire and quite adherent\r\ntongue, are all features which likewise occur in some of the\r\nCystignathinae, and therefore cannot be urged against their affinity.\r\nLastly, the recently discovered South American genus _Hylopsis_ is, as\r\npointed out by Werner,[98] an intermediate link, owing to the extremely\r\nsmall, scarcely visible teeth in the upper jaw.\r\n\r\n_Dendrophryniscus brevipollicatus_ has been found in the neighbourhood of\r\nRio Janeiro. The head is depressed and triangular. The tongue is entire,\r\nbut free behind. The tympanum is suppressed. The omosternum is absent; the\r\nmetasternum forms a long bony style. The sacral diapophyses are\r\ncylindrical. The terminal phalanges are simple, but carry dilated tips. The\r\nfirst finger is rudimentary. The skin is nearly smooth, reddish brown\r\nabove, whitish below; the limbs are cross-barred.\r\n\r\n_Batrachophrynus_ inhabits the mountains of Peru. The head is much\r\ndepressed and small, with the eyes directed upwards, as is usual in\r\nessentially aquatic species. The tongue is large, circular, and entirely\r\nadherent. The tympanum and the Eustachian tubes are suppressed. The\r\nomosternum is cartilaginous, and the metasternum forms a cartilaginous\r\nplate. The sacral diapophyses are cylindrical. The terminal phalanges are\r\nsimple, and carry no discs. The four fingers are short; the toes are\r\nwebbed. The male has no vocal sac. _B. brachydactylus_ has a {225}smooth\r\nskin, olive-brown above with darker spots. _B. macrostomus_, 2 inches in\r\nlength, is distinguished by its larger size, and by its completely webbed\r\ntoes.\r\n\r\nFAM. 6. ENGYSTOMATIDAE (Narrow-mouthed Toads).–_Firmisternia with dilated\r\nsacral diapophyses._\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. ENGYSTOMATINAE.–_Without teeth in the upper jaw._–Although\r\nthere are only about 60 species known, these have been grouped into more\r\nthan two dozen genera, many of which are represented by one or two species\r\nonly. The range of this sub-family is peculiar, namely, Neotropical and\r\nPalaeotropical. _Scaphiophryne_ and _Rhombophryne_ are peculiar to\r\nMadagascar; _Calophrynus_ occurs in the same island and in the Indian\r\nregion; _Xenobatrachus_, _Sphenophryne_, _Liophryne_, _Mantophryne_,\r\n_Callulops_ and _Xenorhina_ live in New Guinea. _Breviceps_, _Cacosternum_\r\nand _Hemisus_ are confined to Africa, while of _Phrynomantis_ two species\r\nlive in Africa, and the third in the Malay island of Amboina. Such freaks\r\nof distribution indicate either that many of these genera are not\r\nestablished upon very valid characters, or that their respective species\r\nare instances of convergent evolution, and do not form natural genetic\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nMany of the members of this sub-family live upon ants and termites, and it\r\nis a well-known fact, not restricted to the Anura, that this kind of fare\r\nhas a peculiar, modifying influence upon the structure of the mouth, teeth,\r\ntongue, limbs, and various other organs. In the present case the tongue is\r\nnot much affected; it is, with few exceptions, more or less oval, not\r\nnicked, but free behind; in the Indian _Glyphoglossus_ and in\r\n_Rhombophryne_ of Madagascar only is it modified into a rather long and\r\ngrooved, almost double, apparatus.\r\n\r\nA very common feature is the small size of the mouth and the formation of a\r\nsnout, which projects beyond the upper rim of the mouth and beyond the\r\nnostrils. Such a prominent and pointed snout is well developed in\r\n_Rhinoderma_, _Phryniscus_, _Calophrynus_, _Stereocyclops_, _Hypopachus_\r\nand _Engystoma_. The mouth is very narrow in _Cacopus_, _Glyphoglossus_,\r\n_Breviceps_, _Rhombophryne_, and _Hemisus_, all creatures which seem to be\r\nconfirmed eaters of ants and termites. However, it must not be supposed\r\nthat the mouth of all the genera is narrow, although this character, rather\r\nmarked in _Engystoma_, is now embodied in the name of the family. A\r\npeculiar development of the palatal region {226}is possibly correlated with\r\nthis food. The palate is mostly toothless, but its skin is frequently\r\nraised into a transverse fold, between or behind the vomers, and into a\r\nsecond fold in front of the oesophagus; these folds are sometimes rather\r\nhard and serrated or denticulated. The palatine bones carry true teeth in\r\n_Rhombophryne_, and sometimes in _Callula_; in _Xenobatrachus_ the teeth\r\nare reduced to two large pairs. The tympanum is usually hidden.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the body is generally very stout. The limbs are short, notably\r\nso in _Glyphoglossus_, _Breviceps_, _Rhombophryne_, _Hemisus_,\r\n_Stereocyclops_ and _Cacopus_. Others, for instance most species of\r\n_Microhyla_, _Phryniscus_, _Callula_, and _Sphenophryne_, are of a very\r\nslender build; and their limbs, instead of being short and well adapted to\r\ndigging, are long and may even be provided with typical adhesive discs,\r\nsupported by T-shaped phalanges, especially in the two genera last named,\r\nand in _Scaphiophryne_ and _Phrynomantis_. However, none of the forms\r\nprovided with discs are known to be arboreal.\r\n\r\nExceptional diversity is shown in the shoulder-girdle and sternum. The\r\nomosternum occurs only in _Rhinoderma_ and _Hemisus_. The metasternum is a\r\ncartilaginous plate, very large in _Cacopus_, distinctly small in\r\n_Breviceps_, and almost absent in _Hemisus_. The precoracoids and clavicles\r\nshow all stages from a well-developed condition (_Breviceps_,\r\n_Rhombophryne_, _Hemisus_, _Rhinoderma_, _Phryniscus_ and _Brachycephalus_)\r\nto complete absence. The circumstance that these bars are very weak in\r\n_Melanobatrachus_, _Calophrynus_, _Scaphiophryne_ and _Hypopachus_, i.e. in\r\nPalæo- and Neo-tropical genera, indicates a widespread tendency towards\r\ncomplete suppression, a feature independently aimed at both in America\r\n(_Engystoma_) and in the Old World.\r\n\r\nUntil we know something about the habits of the members of this much\r\ndiversified sub-family, it is idle to connect the various modifications\r\nwith each other, and thus, by correlation, to find out their meaning. Those\r\nforms which possess well-developed discs on their fingers and toes are said\r\nnot to be arboreal. What is the true meaning of the prominent snout which\r\nis not restricted to the digging forms? Most of the good diggers have\r\nwell-developed precoracoid bars, and the coracoids are distinctly\r\nstrengthened, but in _Glyphoglossus_ and in _Cacopus_ the precoracoids are\r\nentirely {227}absent, and this loss is compensated for by exceptionally\r\nstrong coracoids.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, those genera are to be considered as the most primitive which\r\nhave undergone the fewest losses. Those with a complete shoulder-girdle,\r\nwith an omo- and meta-sternum and with simple phalanges, are necessarily\r\nthe older forms. One step farther back in another direction, the possession\r\nof teeth on the palate, and on the upper jaw, leads to those genera which\r\nhave been separated off as DYSCOPHINAE, while teeth in the lower jaw\r\nconstitute the GENYOPHRYNINAE. Lastly, the firmisternal type has\r\nnecessarily been evolved from the arciferous condition, and there the two\r\nBufonid genera _Myobatrachus_ and _Rhinophrynus_, the former Australian,\r\nthe latter Mexican, with their narrow and scarcely overlapping epicoracoid\r\ncartilages, seem to form a connecting link, although their ant-eating\r\nhabits, with concomitant modifications in structure, may be nothing but\r\ncases of convergent evolution.\r\n\r\nKey to the genera:–\r\n\r\n  I.

Terminal phalanges simple, and not dilated. Tongue\r\nheart-shaped, and free behind. Pupil horizontal. Habitat, Chili.\r\n\r\n_Rh. darwini_, the only species, was discovered by Darwin, during the\r\nvoyage of the _Beagle_. Its total length is only 3 cm., or little more than\r\none inch. The shape is grotesque, as the skin is prolonged, beyond the very\r\nsmall triangular mouth, into a false nose, _i.e._ a nose-shaped projection,\r\nwhile the nostrils remain at their original place. The skin is smooth\r\nabove, granular on the under parts, and forms a triangular flap or\r\nspur-shaped appendage on the heel. A glandular fold extends along the sides\r\nof the body. The general colour is brown above, black below, with large\r\nwhite patches, the latter colour being sometimes predominant on the throat\r\nand chest. The male has a pair of internal vocal sacs, and the use of these\r\nas nurseries for the young has made this species famous.\r\n\r\nEspada[99] has given an elaborate account of this species, which lives on\r\nthe ground in shady woods. Its voice sounds like a little bell, and before\r\ntaking its short jumps, it erects itself vertically upon the hind-limbs.\r\nThe gular sac of the male opens by two slits, one on each side of the\r\ntongue. Generally this sac does not extend beyond the middle of the chest,\r\nbut during the breeding time the eggs are put into it, whereupon it becomes\r\ngreatly distended, so much so indeed that it reaches back as far as the\r\ngroins; {229}dorsalwards around the flanks, almost to the vertebral\r\ndiapophyses; ventrally and forwards it reaches the chin. The walls of the\r\nsac are of the same structure as the buccal lining, of which they are in\r\nfact continuations. They adhere, at intervals, to the cutis and to the\r\npectoral and abdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the distension of the sac upon neighbouring organs is\r\ntwofold. First, the viscera are pressed back within the abdomen; this\r\ndisturbance is temporary and does not apply to all specimens; the feeding\r\nin no way impeded. Secondly, a permanent change is produced in the\r\ndirection of the precoracoid bars, in such a way that each bar is curved\r\ntailwards and rests with its ventral half upon the coracoid; owing to this\r\nforcible bending the clavicles do not meet each other. There is, of course,\r\nnot so much space gained by this slight rearrangement of the\r\nshoulder-girdle as Espada implies, but we have here, perhaps, an\r\nillustration of direct correlation between two originally independent\r\norgans, namely, shoulder-girdle and vocal sacs. Repeated distension of the\r\nthroat-bag during every breeding season, while the whole organisation of\r\nthe male is in a highly excitable condition, has pressed the clavicular\r\nbars back, or rather has staved them in, and this at first pathological and\r\nabnormal condition has at last become a fixed feature. It is to be\r\nregretted that we know next to nothing about the habits, especially the\r\nmode of breeding, of the other genera which likewise have reflected or very\r\nfeeble precoracoids and clavicles. Their weakness or even complete absence\r\nmust have a reason, or rather must have had a cause.\r\n\r\nThe pairing and oviposition, and the manner in which the eggs are conveyed\r\ninto the gular sac, have not yet been observed. Espada examined five males\r\nwith young, the number of which varied from five to fifteen. In one male\r\nwith eleven embryos the most developed tadpoles measured 13.5 mm. from the\r\nsnout to the end of the tail, and they were lying within the chest of the\r\nfather, the less advanced in the farther recesses of the bag. Three of the\r\ntadpoles had already completely-formed fore- and hind-limbs, while the arms\r\nwere still hidden. The least developed were still globular, a proof that\r\nthe eggs are conveyed into the bag. Another male with fifteen embryos\r\nlooked as if it had gorged itself with the almost fully-formed tadpoles,\r\nwhich measured 14 mm. They were quite irregularly distributed, and nowhere\r\n{230}attached to the walls of the bag. None of them had horny\r\njaw-armaments, and not even the smallest specimens showed any traces of\r\ngills, resembling in this latter character those in the female brood-pouch\r\nof _Nototrema_. The intestine of the tadpoles is short and thick, coiled up\r\nspirally and filled with yolk, certainly not with vegetable or other\r\nforeign matter. Consequently the entire development from the egg to the\r\ncomplete stump-tailed little creature is undergone within the pouch; and\r\nthis, after the young have escaped, probably shrinks back to its original\r\nsize and acts as a gular vocal sac.\r\n\r\n_Phryniscus._–About ten species of this tropical American genus are known;\r\nthey extend from Costa Rica to Buenos Aires. They differ not inconsiderably\r\nin various details. The tongue is elliptical, entire, and free behind. The\r\npalate is smooth. The tympanic disc is absent. Fingers and toes more or\r\nless webbed, sometimes with swollen tips, without, however, forming\r\nadhesive discs. In a few species the first toe is quite indistinct. The\r\nmale has a subgular vocal sac. The mouth is small, and there is a short\r\nsnout. The general appearance varies much. _Ph. nigricans_ of Uruguay,\r\netc., is stout and has very short hind-limbs; the skin of the upper parts\r\nis black, spotted with white, and covered with warts. Most of the other\r\nspecies are slender, with larger hind-limbs and a perfectly smooth skin,\r\nthe coloration of which ranges from dull uniform brown, or black with\r\ncrimson markings, to bright green with purple spots. The under parts are,\r\nas a rule, conspicuously coloured, a rare feature in Anura, the favourite\r\ncolours being orange, yellow, or even crimson, with or without black\r\npatches.\r\n\r\n_Phryniscus nigricans_ has been observed in Paraguay by Budgett,[100] who\r\ngives the following account. This is a brilliantly coloured frog of\r\ntoad-like appearance, and about 33 mm. in length. The ground-colour is\r\nblack, with yellow spots or patches on the upper parts, the under parts are\r\nblack, with scarlet blotches, the palms of the hands and soles of the feet\r\nare scarlet. At the breeding season both sexes utter a call-note which\r\nconsists of two clear musical \"rings,\" followed by a long descending\r\n\"trill,\" like that of our British Greenfinch. This frog, which at ordinary\r\ntimes is the slowest and boldest of frogs, is now active and excessively\r\nshy. Swimming rapidly between the blades of grass, it climbs a {231}tuft,\r\nand dilating its throat, repeats its call; but if in the least disturbed,\r\nit is suddenly gone. The eggs are laid in quite temporary pools in grassy\r\nground, and form separate globules of jelly, which float on the surface of\r\nthe water, and are heavily pigmented. The development is excessively rapid.\r\nThe segmentation beginning at 10 A.M., they were hatched and wriggling\r\nabout by 7 A.M. the following day. They are probably washed down into\r\ndeeper pools by the retreating waters, and for this purpose the manner in\r\nwhich the eggs are laid, namely, in separate globules of jelly, seems\r\nespecially suited.\r\n\r\n_Brachycephalus ephippium_ in Brazil, the only species, is remarkable for\r\nthe development of a broad dorsal shield of bone, which is fused with the\r\nprocesses of the second to seventh vertebrae, an ossification which\r\nstrongly resembles that of several species of the likewise Brazilian\r\n_Ceratophrys_, a genus of the Cystignathinae.\r\n\r\n_Stereocyclops_ is remarkable for the peculiar formation and protection of\r\nthe eyeballs. The anterior portion of the sclerotic is ossified into a\r\nring, which surrounds the transparent cornea. Another peculiarity lies in\r\nthe metasternum, which is so much broadened out that its cartilage is in\r\nwide contact with the posterior edge of the coracoids. The epidermis is\r\neverywhere \"thickened by a chitin-like deposit.\" The only species, _S.\r\nincrassatus_, found near Rio Janeiro, is an altogether aberrant creature.\r\nIts general appearance recalls that of _Pipa_. The gape is large, with a\r\nslightly projecting muzzle; the limbs are so short that the upper arms and\r\nthe thighs scarcely stand out from the broadened and flattened body, which\r\nis leathery brown, with a narrow white median line extending dorsally from\r\nthe nose to the vent.\r\n\r\n_Engystoma_, with about five species in the Southern States, Central and\r\nSouth America, is the type-genus of the whole family, chiefly on account of\r\npriority of name. It is fairly characteristic in so far as the mouth forms\r\na narrow, somewhat projecting snout; the precoracoids, the clavicles, and\r\nthe omosternum are absent, the palate is devoid of teeth, the lining of the\r\nmouth forms a dermal ridge across the palate and another in front of the\r\noesophagus, the tympanum is hidden, the sacral diapophyses are moderately\r\ndilated, and the tongue is elliptical and free behind. The pupil is\r\nvertical. The fingers and toes are free, ending in slightly dilated or\r\nblunt tips; the terminal phalanges are simple {232}and the hind-limbs are\r\nshort. The male has a subgular vocal sac.\r\n\r\nThe most northern species is _E. carolinense_, living in the Southern\r\nUnited States, concealed under the bark of fallen trees or in old fences.\r\nThe skin is smooth, but forms a fold across the head, behind the eyes. The\r\ngeneral colour is brown, with light, whitish dots on the under parts. Total\r\nlength 1 inch.\r\n\r\n_Breviceps_ is a South African genus with three species. The coracoids are\r\nvery strong and directed backwards, but so broadened that they form a long\r\nand strong symphysis, touching in front that of the precoracoids, which\r\nstand transversely and are well developed. The metasternum is cartilaginous\r\nand decidedly small. The sacral vertebra has much dilated diapophyses and\r\nis co-ossified with the coccyx. The general appearance is extremely stout\r\nand short, the head being almost drawn into the nearly globular body, and\r\nending in a short snout with a small mouth-opening. The tongue is long and\r\noval, not nicked, but slightly free behind. _B. mossambicus_ is about 2\r\ninches long, and looks like an overstuffed round bag, out of which the\r\nshort arms and legs project from the elbows and knee-joints only. The\r\ntarsus is provided with a strong horny, spade-like tubercle, which enables\r\nthe creature to dig into the ground, and into the nests of termites, which\r\nseem to be its chief food. Peters found this species in enormous numbers,\r\nduring the tropical rains, coming out of the ground, whither they withdraw\r\nagain completely for the dry season. The skin is smooth, reddish brown\r\nabove, with darker patches; the under parts are dull white, with a large\r\nblack patch on the throat.\r\n\r\n_Hemisus_ is another African genus, with two species, _H. guttatum_ in\r\nNatal, and _H. sudanense_ in East and West Africa. This genus is so\r\nexceptional in its shoulder-girdle, that Cope separated it from all the\r\nother Anura as a special sub-order Gastrechmia. The precoracoids are\r\nextremely strong, and form a broad symphysis from which springs the long\r\ncartilaginous omosternum; the coracoids are slender, very long, and\r\nconverge backwards to a narrow symphysis, and there is no metasternum. The\r\ntwo symphyses are connected by a narrow cartilaginous median bar, probably\r\nproduced by the much modified epicoracoid cartilages. However, except for\r\nthe reverse development shown by the omo- and meta-sternum, it is easy to\r\nconnect this apparently quite anomalous shoulder-girdle of _Hemisus_ with\r\nthat of _Breviceps_. {233}(cf. Fig. 5, 5 and 6, p. 25). The sacral\r\ndiapophyses are slightly dilated; the fingers and toes are free and end in\r\npoints. The tongue is triangular, broader in front. The lining of the mouth\r\nforms a transverse ridge across the palate, and another in front of the\r\noesophagus. The male has a subgular sac. The general shape is stout, the\r\nhead small and ending in a pointed snout. Colour brown above, with whitish\r\nspots. Total length about 2 inches.\r\n\r\n_Glyphoglossus_ has a peculiar tongue. It is elongated, notched behind and\r\nin front, divided into two lateral halves by a deep groove; moreover, the\r\ntongue is not only extensively free behind, but also slightly so in front.\r\nThe skin of the palate forms a transverse serrated ridge. The precoracoids\r\nand the omosternum are absent; the metasternum is a well-developed\r\ncartilaginous plate. The sacral diapophyses are moderately dilated; the\r\nterminal phalanges are simple. _G. molossus_, the only species, is\r\nolive-brown above, marbled on the sides; the under parts are uniformly\r\nwhitish. This creature, about 2 inches in length, looks like a roundish\r\nbag, with a ridiculous, short face. The type-specimen, still the only one\r\nknown, was taken by Dr Theobald under the following circumstances:–\"I had\r\nhalted one day within the tidal portion of the Irawaddy delta, to enable my\r\nboatmen to prepare their dinner. One of my servants, having cooked his\r\nrice, poured out the hot water as usual on the ground, and some of it went\r\ndown a hole that happened to be near the spot. No sooner, however, had the\r\nhot water disappeared than out scrambled in great haste a fine\r\n_Glyphoglossus_, only, alas! to be transferred to a collecting jar.\"\r\n\r\n_Phrynella._–The tongue is heart-shaped, free behind. The palate is smooth\r\nand toothless. The fingers and toes end in small discs, supported by\r\nT-shaped phalanges; the fingers are free, the toes extensively webbed.\r\nPrecoracoids absent; metasternum cartilaginous. Pupil horizontal. Malay\r\nPeninsula.\r\n\r\n_Ph. pollicaris_ is dark olive brown above; an oblique yellow line runs\r\nfrom the eye to the angle of the mouth; a pale yellow mark, across the\r\nforehead, through the eyes, and down the sides of the body. A dark-centred\r\nyellow patch on the anal region. The limbs are banded yellow and brown. The\r\nunder parts are brown, with paler specks, dark on the throat. Iris red\r\nbrown. The whole coloration changes considerably.\r\n\r\n\"They inhabit the hills of Perak from 3000 feet upwards, {234}and live in\r\nholes in trees, which are so situated as to contain more or less\r\nrain-water. They have a loud flute-like, musical note, which they utter at\r\nirregular intervals, principally during the night. The form and size of the\r\nhole in which they are seem to have a great deal to do with the loudness of\r\nthe note, as specimens when extracted from their holes have far more feeble\r\nvocal powers than they had when in them. These frogs blow themselves out\r\nwith air, and look more like bladders than anything else. When inflated\r\nthey float on the surface of the water, and will remain motionless for a\r\nlong time, with legs and arms stretched out.\"[101]\r\n\r\n_Callula._–The tongue is round, entire, and free behind. The palatine bones\r\nform an acute, sometimes toothed ridge across the palate; two dermal\r\nserrated ridges in front of the oesophagus. Fingers free, sometimes with\r\ndilated tips, supported by T-shaped phalanges. Precoracoids and omosternum\r\nabsent; metasternum cartilaginous. Pupil round. About seven species in the\r\nIndian region.\r\n\r\n_C. pulchra._–The following account has been extracted from Mr. S. S.\r\nFlower's observations:[102]–\r\n\r\nThis pretty creature inhabits most of the warm portions of the continental\r\nIndian region, from India and Ceylon to South China and Malacca. The back\r\nis a rich dark brown, divided from the yellow of the head by a narrow black\r\nline which extends from eye to eye and forwards to each nostril. A\r\nconspicuous yellow band runs from the eyes to the hind-limbs. The sides of\r\nthe body and the limbs are mottled yellow and brown. The under parts are\r\ndirty buff; the throat of the male is black. The intensity of colouring\r\nvaries individually and from time to time, the contrast between the brown\r\nand yellow being occasionally very brilliant. Total length up to 3 inches,\r\nthe male being the smaller sex.\r\n\r\n\"I have been told by both English and natives that this frog was unknown in\r\nSingapore until some nine or ten years ago, when it was introduced by a\r\nhalf-caste (why, it is not known), and that it rapidly spread about the\r\nisland. It is now well known as the 'Bullfrog' by the English in Singapore,\r\nand detested for the noise it makes at night. The voice of these rotund\r\nanimals can be heard every night after heavy rain; it is {235}a deep\r\nguttural croak, 'wau-auhhhh,' very strident and prolonged. The males croak\r\nwhile floating on the surface of the water, the single vocal sac under the\r\nmouth inflated like a globe, and the arms and legs extended. They can hop\r\nwell on land and are good swimmers. The skin is excessively slimy; the\r\nsecretion comes off profusely, and dries on the hand into a sort of white\r\ngum, with a faint aromatic smell. This gum dissolves in hot water and\r\ncoagulates in cold. The general appearance of these frogs is very stout,\r\ntheir girth being about twice the length from snout to vent. The tongue,\r\nwhich is oblong in spirit specimens, in life is very elastic, assuming,\r\nwhen extended, a vermiform shape and reaching about 4 cm. in length. They\r\nappear after sunset, crawling on old wood and feeding on white ants.\"\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. DYSCOPHINAE.–_With teeth in the upper jaw._\r\n\r\nThis small group of nine genera, with scarcely more than one dozen species,\r\nall with one exception living in Madagascar, has been separated by\r\nBoulenger from the Engystomatinae merely on account of the presence of\r\nteeth on the upper jaw and on the vomerine margin of the palatine bones. He\r\nhimself remarks that _Calluella_ may be considered a toothed _Hypopachus_,\r\nand _Plethodontohyla_ a toothed _Callula_. These are obvious cases of\r\nconvergent analogy. Except for the teeth, the Indian _Calluella_ would be\r\nmerged into the American _Hypopachus_, and this would present an instance\r\nof the most puzzling geographical distribution. In the case of the other\r\ntwo genera, one Indian and Malayan, the other Malagasy, no such suspicion\r\nwould arise, since there are many other instances of such a coincidence of\r\ndistribution. There is the same divergence or unsettled condition in the\r\nmodification of various parts in the Dyscophinae as in the Engystomatinae.\r\nThe precoracoid bars are weak and curved backwards, and closely pressed\r\nagainst the strong coracoids, in _Dyscophus_, _Calluella_ and _Platypelis_,\r\nwhile these elements are reduced to unossified bars, and the clavicular\r\nportions completely lost, in _Plethodontohyla_ and in _Phrynocara_. The\r\nomosternum is absent and the metasternum is small in all except\r\n_Dyscophus_, in which both these parts are exceptionally well developed and\r\nlarge, although remaining unossified. The palate of _Dyscophus_ and\r\n_Calluella_ is provided with curious, serrated dermal folds like those\r\nwhich are so common in the Engystomatinae; and well-developed discs on the\r\nfingers and toes, supported by T-shaped phalanges, are {236}possessed by\r\n_Platypelis_, _Cophyla_ and others. The sacral diapophyses are dilated. The\r\npupil is either horizontal or vertical. Those which are provided with discs\r\nto the fingers and toes are climbers, and mostly slender and long-legged,\r\nsometimes of very small size, for instance _Cophyla_, the body of which is\r\nscarcely one inch in length.\r\n\r\nThe genera can be determined by means of the following key:–[103]\r\n\r\n  _A_. Pupil vertical. Palatine teeth in long transverse series.\r\n\r\n    _a_. Precoracoids ossified. Tips of fingers and toes not dilated.\r\n\r\n      Sternum very large. Madagascar .......... _Dyscophus._\r\n\r\n      Sternum small. Burmah .......... _Calluella._\r\n\r\n    _b_. Precoracoids not ossified. Tips dilated ..........\r\n    _Plethodontohyla._\r\n\r\n  _B_. Pupil horizontal.\r\n\r\n    _a_. Palatine teeth in long transverse series.\r\n\r\n      α. Precoracoids ossified. Tips dilated.\r\n\r\n        Fingers and toes free. Precoracoids entirely ossified ..........\r\n        _Mantipus._\r\n\r\n        Fingers and toes webbed at the base. Precoracoids semi-ossified\r\n        .......... _Platyhyla._\r\n\r\n      β. Precoracoids not ossified. Tips not dilated ..........\r\n      _Phrynocara._\r\n\r\n    _b_. Palatine teeth in one or two small groups.\r\n\r\n      Precoracoids ossified. Tips dilated.\r\n\r\n      Two small groups of palatine teeth .......... _Platypelis._\r\n\r\n      One single group in the middle of the palate .......... _Cophyla._\r\n\r\n      No teeth on the palate .......... _Anodontohyla._\r\n\r\n_Dyscophus antongili._–Madagascar. General appearance stout, with short\r\nlegs and a wide mouth. Total length about 3 inches. The skin is mostly\r\nsmooth, and forms a broad glandular fold which extends from the eye to the\r\ngroin. The upper parts are beautiful magenta red, with a purplish streak\r\nbeneath the lateral folds; the under parts are yellowish white, with minute\r\ngrey specks. Red or pink colours, and the lateral folds, occur also in most\r\nof the other members of this family, for instance in the Indian genus\r\n_Calluella_.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 3. GENYOPHRYNINAE.–_With very small teeth on the anterior portion\r\nof the lower jaw._\r\n\r\n_Genyophryne thomsoni._–Pupil horizontal.  Tongue oblong and entire. With\r\nteeth on the palatine bones, and a serrated transverse dermal ridge in\r\nfront of the oesophagus. Sternum cartilaginous. Precoracoids absent. Sacral\r\ndiapophyses moderately {237}dilated. Tympanum hidden. Head large and much\r\ndepressed. Heel with a triangular dermal flap. The smooth skin is pink\r\nbrown above, with blackish marks; a light line extends on each side from\r\nthe eye along the back. Under parts black. About 32 mm. in length. Sudest\r\nIsland, between New Guinea and the Louisiade Archipelago.\r\n\r\nFAM. 7. RANIDAE.–Frogs, in the true sense, are all well diagnosed as\r\n_Firmisternia, with cylindrical sacral diapophyses_. According to the\r\npresence or absence of teeth in the jaws they can be subdivided as\r\nfollows:–\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. CERATOBATRACHINAE, with teeth in the upper and in the lower\r\njaws. The sole representative is the genus _Ceratobatrachus_.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. RANINAE, with teeth in the upper, but none in the lower jaw.\r\nThese are the Ranidae of Boulenger in the Catalogue of Batrachia Salientia.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 3. DENDROBATINAE, without teeth in the upper and lower jaws.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. CERATOBATRACHINAE.–Teeth present in both jaws. Those of the\r\nlower jaw, between 20 and 30 in number in _Ceratobatrachus_, the only\r\ngenus, are nearly all inserted upon the articular bone; only 2 or 3 are\r\ncarried by the dentary element, which, although large, enters into the\r\nformation of the upper border of the jaw at the anterior end only. In the\r\nsmall extent of the share of the dentary in the formation of the edge of\r\nthe lower jaw, and in its anterior \"toothlike\" process, _Rana adspersa_ of\r\nAfrica bears unmistakable resemblance to this genus. The tongue is deeply\r\nnotched, and free behind. Pupil horizontal. Vomers furnished with teeth.\r\nTympanum distinct and large. Precoracoids present. Omosternum and\r\npresternum with a bony style. Sacral diapophyses cylindrical. Fingers and\r\ntoes free, with swollen tips. Outer metatarsals united. Male with two\r\ninternal vocal sacs.\r\n\r\n_G. guentheri_, Solomon Islands, the only species, has an enormous mouth\r\nand a triangular head not much smaller than the rest of the body. The skull\r\nis furnished with prominent ridges and a small curved spine at the angle of\r\nthe jaws. The hind-limbs are rather short. The skin of the upper parts\r\nshows linear ridges, variously arranged; that of the belly is granular. A\r\ntriangular dermal flap on the tip of the muzzle, one on the {238}upper edge\r\nof the eyelids, others on the heel and above the vent. The colour and\r\nmarkings are very variable, the ground-colour is yellowish to pink, brown,\r\ngrey or olive, with darker and lighter markings. Total length of the males\r\n3 inches, of females 3½ inches.–Guppy, the discoverer of this peculiar\r\ncreature, remarks that \"horned Frogs are very numerous in these islands,\r\nand so closely do they imitate their surroundings in colour and pattern,\r\nthat on one occasion I captured one by accidentally placing my hand on it\r\nwhen clasping a tree.\"\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. RANINAE.–The vertebrae are procoelous and devoid of ribs. The\r\nprecoracoids are always present and ossified from the clavicles, and are\r\nparallel with the much stronger and ossified coracoids. The omosternum\r\nusually possesses a bony style, but in the Indian genera _Nannobatrachus_\r\nand _Nannophrys_ and in _Phyllodromus_ of Ecuador it remains cartilaginous,\r\nand in _Colosthetus_ of Colombia it is absent. The metasternum also\r\npossesses a bony style, but it remains cartilaginous in the Indian genera\r\n_Oxyglossus_, _Nannophrys_, _Nannobatrachus_ and _Phyllodromus_, in the\r\nlast two genera rather reduced and slender, while in the Ecuadorian and\r\nColombian genera _Hylixalus_, _Prostherapis_ and _Colosthetus_, it is\r\nreduced to a membranous piece. In quite a number of genera the normal\r\nnumber of phalanges is increased by one owing to the intercalation of an\r\nextra phalanx between the terminal and the otherwise penultimate\r\nphalanx.[104] This is the case in all the species of _Cassina_,\r\n_Hylambates_, _Rappia_, _Megalixalus_, _Rhacophorus_, _Chiromantis_,\r\n_Ixalus_ and _Nyctixalus_, but it is doubtful if all these genera are\r\nthereby more nearly related to each other than to the rest of the Raninae.\r\nThe structure of the tips of the fingers and toes exhibits more variety.\r\nThe terminal phalanges are mostly simple, with slight swellings at the\r\nends, or they are Y- or T-shaped in conformity with more or less developed\r\nadhesive discs; in the African genus _Hylambates_ only they are\r\nclaw-shaped, as in the Hylidae.\r\n\r\n_Gampsosteonyx batesi_, recently described by Boulenger from the Gaboon,\r\nshows a unique modification of the terminal phalanges of the second to the\r\nfifth toes. They are transformed into sharp and curved claws, like those of\r\na cat, but instead {239}of horny sheaths, it is the bone itself which is\r\nthus sharpened and perforates the skin, an anomaly reminding us of the ribs\r\nof _Triton waltli_. Total length of the type-specimens, about 3 inches.\r\n\r\nAdhesive discs are common, and are best developed in _Rhacophorus_,\r\n_Ixalus_, _Rappia_, and _Megalixalus_. In the Neotropical genera, excepting\r\n_Colosthetus_, the discs are very peculiar, being provided on the upper\r\nside with leathery scales which are separated by a fissure. The fourth and\r\nfifth metatarsals either diverge and are connected by a distinct web, or\r\nthey lie close together with only a groove between them, or lastly they\r\nappear externally united.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.–Map showing distribution of the Ranidae.]\r\n\r\nThe tympanic disc is very variable, large, small or quite hidden. Vomerine\r\nteeth are present or absent. The pupil contracts into a horizontal slit\r\nexcept in some Palaeotropical genera. The tongue is universally free\r\nbehind, mostly deeply notched, and can be well protruded; only in the\r\nIndian _Oxyglossus_ and in the Neotropical genera, excepting _Hylixalus_,\r\nits posterior margin is entire.–There are terrestrial, arboreal, and\r\naquatic members in this large sub-family. The geographical distribution of\r\nthe Raninae, which comprise about twenty genera with at least some 270\r\nspecies, is almost entirely Arctogaean. None, with the exception of three\r\nspecies in the Papuan subregion, occur in the Australian region; and only\r\nfour genera, with one or two species each, inhabit the tropical Andesian\r\ndistrict, the {240}remainder of South America being without any Raninae.\r\nAll the species of the whole Periarctic region belong to the genus _Rana_\r\nexcept in Eastern Asia, where the closely allied genus _Rhacophorus_ occurs\r\nalso. The entire sub-family of Raninae is, in its fulness and diversity of\r\ndevelopment, essentially Palaeotropical.\r\n\r\nMany of the genera, even in the present more liberal sense as interpreted\r\nby Boulenger, are based upon unimportant characters, and in reality run\r\ninto each other. This is for instance the case with _Rana_ and\r\n_Rhacophorus_.\r\n\r\nThe following tabular arrangement is merely a key for determination and\r\ndoes not necessarily express relationships. The presence or absence of\r\nvomerine teeth is a character easily ascertained, but it separates closely\r\nallied genera, for instance, _Rhacophorus_ from _Ixalus_ and _Micrixalus_\r\nfrom Rana.\r\n\r\nThe genera with extra, interpolated phalanges are marked *.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE GENERA OF RANINAE.\r\n\r\n  I.

Colombia ..........\r\n        _Colosthetus latinasus._\r\n\r\n_Phyllobates._[105]–This is one of the few Neotropical genera, and like\r\nnearly all of these has peculiar adhesive discs on the fingers and toes,\r\neach disc bearing on its upper surface two dermal scales. The tympanum is\r\ndistinct. Vomerine teeth are absent. The general appearance of the five\r\nspecies is that of tree-frogs. One species, _Ph. bicolor_, yellowish above,\r\ndark brown beneath, lives in Cuba. The others inhabit Central America and\r\nVenezuela. They seem to have peculiar nursing habits. _Ph. trinitatis_ of\r\nVenezuela and Trinidad carries its tadpoles on its back, on to which the\r\nyoung fix themselves by means of their suckers. Nothing is known about\r\ntheir breeding habits, for instance whether the young are hatched on the\r\nback, or, as seems more likely, if the parents (the specimen described by\r\nBoulenger[106] is a male) only give their offspring a temporary lift in\r\norder to convey them from a drying-up pool to a healthier place. It is\r\nremarkable that several species of Dendrobatinae, which inhabit the same\r\ncountries, have precisely the same habits.[107]\r\n\r\n_Arthroleptis._–Slender and long-limbed little frogs, about one inch in\r\nlength. The fingers and toes are free, very slender, and end in slightly\r\ndilated tips, the supporting phalanges being simple. The tympanum is\r\nvariable. The skin is smooth or finely granulated. The colours are\r\ninconspicuous, brown or grey tones usually prevailing. About ten species\r\nare known, mostly {243}from Continental Africa, a few from Madagascar and\r\nthe islands in the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\n_A. seychellensis._–Brauer[108] has discovered the mode of nursing of this\r\nfrog. He found a specimen of _A. seychellensis_ which carried nine tadpoles\r\non its back, in the month of August, in the Seychelles, about 1500 feet\r\nabove sea-level, upon an old tree-fern. The little ones were already\r\nprovided with long tails, the hind-limbs were partly free, the fore-limbs\r\nstill covered by the skin, and they held on by their bellies; not, like the\r\nyoung of _Phyllobates_, by their \"suckers.\" Another specimen carried young\r\nwhich were still further developed. He also found an old frog, near which\r\nwas lying a little heap of eggs, not enveloped in a common mass of jelly.\r\nThe old frog escaped, but the eggs were taken care of in a vessel with\r\nmoist sand at the bottom. By the following morning the eggs were hatched\r\nand the tadpoles were clinging by their bellies on to the walls of the\r\nglass. Brauer concludes that the young, when hatched, creep on to the\r\nparent's back, he or she waiting near the heap of eggs until the latter are\r\nready. Curiously enough, he did not find out the sex of the nurse, nor are\r\nwe told if the young are taken to the nearest water to finish their\r\nmetamorphosis, or if they remain upon the parent's back until they hop off\r\nas baby-frogs. The yolk is very large. When the four limbs are already\r\ndeveloped, the gill-cavity possesses no gills and no outer opening; and\r\nsince the lungs are only just beginning to sprout, the tadpole must needs\r\nbreathe by means of its skin. The jaws have no horny coverings. The adults\r\nlive on the ground between moist leaves, and eat chiefly termites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.–_Arthroleptis seychellensis_, carrying Tadpoles. ×\r\n1. (After Brauer.)]\r\n\r\n_Cornufer_, with about twelve species, is an essentially Austro-Malayan and\r\nPolynesian genus, but one species, _C. johnstoni_, has been found in the\r\nCameroons. The fingers and toes are free, and their T-shaped phalanges\r\nsupport adhesive discs. The tympanum is distinct. The general shape is\r\nfrog-like, usually with slender and very long hind-limbs and toes, the\r\ndiscs of the latter being much smaller than those of the fingers. The\r\ncoloration is dull, mostly brown, more or less marbled, whitish below. The\r\n{244}upper eyelid of some species, _e.g._ of _G. unicolor_ of New Guinea,\r\nhas a small tubercle, hence the generic name. The skin of the back is\r\nglandular and granular, forming slight folds on the back and on the sides\r\nof the head in some species. The male has one or two internal vocal sacs.\r\n\r\n_C. corrugatus_ is one of the most widely distributed species, inhabiting\r\nthe Philippines, New Guinea, and Duke of York Island. The granular skin\r\nforms longitudinal folds on the back, one of which reaches from the eye to\r\nthe shoulder. Brownish above with darker markings, below yellowish, with or\r\nwithout brown spots on the throat.–Three species inhabit the Fiji Islands.\r\n\r\nOf _C. solomonis_ of the Solomon Islands little is known about the\r\npropagation, although the large size of the egg, which measures 5 mm. in\r\ndiameter, suggests that the young undergo most or the whole of their\r\nmetamorphosis within the egg.\r\n\r\n_Chiromantis_ is distinguished by the peculiar arrangement of the fingers,\r\nthe first and second being opposed to the others; their terminal phalanges\r\nare obtuse and support small knobs or discs. The general shape is that of a\r\nfrog with long and slender hind-limbs. The tympanum is distinct.\r\n\r\n_Ch. xerampelina_, the type-species, was discovered by Peters at\r\nMozambique; it is a middle-sized frog, about 2 inches in length, brown\r\nabove with reddish spots on the sides; the male is devoid of vocal sacs.\r\n\r\n_Ch. petersi_, a native of East Africa, differs from the preceding by the\r\npossession of an internal vocal sac. _Ch. rufescens_ = _guineensis_ shows\r\nvery little of the typical grasping arrangement of the fingers; the two\r\ninner ones are separated from the two outer fingers by a wide gap, but they\r\nall lie in the same plane, are much webbed and possess large discs, so that\r\nby the latter two characters a link is formed with _Rhacophorus_, to which\r\nthe present genus is closely allied. Total length about 2½ inches.\r\n\r\nBuchholz[109] has observed the peculiar breeding habits of this rather\r\nlarge, brown, and slender tree-frog in the Cameroons. In the month of June\r\nhe found on the leaves of a low tree, standing in the water, a white foamy\r\nmass, like the froth of a broken egg, containing a number of newly hatched\r\nlarvae and quite transparent eggs. Within three or four days this mass\r\nbecame {245}fluid, and the larvae, provided with external gills and a long\r\ntail, swam about in the slime. In the natural course of events the larvae\r\nare probably washed down into the water by the rain. He found that the\r\nfemale deposits the eggs in the foamy mass at night, during the months of\r\nJune and July, on various kinds of trees, either between the roots or in a\r\ncavity formed by gluing together several leaves, sometimes 10 feet and more\r\nabove the water, or near the margin. On one occasion the mother was seen\r\nsitting upon the foamy mass, clasping the same with its four limbs.\r\n\r\n_Rhacophorus._–This large genus, containing more than forty species, has a\r\ncurious distribution. At least one dozen species are found in Madagascar,\r\neight or nine in Ceylon, the rest in Southern India, the Himalayas, the\r\nMalay Islands and Philippines, extending northwards through China and\r\nSouthern Japan. Therefore this genus, with the three species of the African\r\n_Chiromantis_, extends over the whole of the Palaeotropical region. The\r\ngeneric name has reference to the possession by many species of little\r\ndermal flaps, especially at the inner side of the heel, and it has nothing\r\nto do with the parachute-like use of the hands and feet of certain species,\r\nto be mentioned presently.\r\n\r\nThe terminal phalanges are generally bifurcated, rarely obtuse, and support\r\nwell-developed adhesive discs. The fingers and toes are webbed to a\r\nvariable extent. The two outer metatarsals are likewise connected by a web.\r\nThe tympanum is distinct. The general appearance is that of tree-frogs, and\r\nmany of them are green. The males have one or two internal vocal sacs. Not\r\nall the species have dermal appendages. _Rh. maximus_, for instance, the\r\nlargest of all, living in the Himalayan forests, has none. A heel-flap\r\noccurs in some half-dozen Indian species; and _Rh. madagascariensis_ has\r\nthese flaps on the heels and on the elbows. Some have queer little lappets\r\nabove the vent, or on the edges of the arms and legs; in others the bend of\r\nthe arm is fringed. The small size of these appendages, in comparison with\r\nthe webs and discs, makes them practically useless so far as increase of\r\nsurface is concerned, and they have most likely some other, although\r\nunknown meaning, especially the flaps over the vent. Lastly, in the\r\nmajority of species the fingers are not more than half-webbed, or even\r\nless, and in a few only, the webs reach down to the discs.\r\n\r\n{246}Several species of this genus are remarkable for two reasons. First,\r\nthe great enlargement of the fully-webbed hands and feet, which are then\r\nused as parachutes; secondly, the mode of propagation.\r\n\r\nGreatly exaggerated notions are, however, entertained about the parachutes,\r\never since Wallace's description[110] of the first \"flying frog.\" The\r\ncreature was brought to him in Borneo by a Chinese workman. \"He assured me\r\nthat he had seen it come down, in a slanting direction, from a high tree,\r\nas if it flew.... The body was about four inches long, while the webs of\r\neach hind-foot, when fully expanded, covered a surface of four square\r\ninches, and the webs of all the feet together about twelve square inches.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.–_Rhacophorus pardalis_, × about 1. (From Wallace,\r\n_Malay Archipelago_.)]\r\n\r\nThe species in question is _Rh. pardalis_, an inhabitant of Borneo and of\r\nthe Philippine Islands. Specimens from Wallace's Collection are in the\r\nNational Collection and the largest specimen {247}shows the following\r\nmeasurements. Total length 6.5 cm. or 2½ inches, not 4 inches.\r\n\r\n  Area covered by one fully-expanded hand 3.4 square cm.\r\n      \"          \"           \"       foot 6.0   \"     \"\r\n                                          –––\r\n                                          9.4 square cm.\r\n\r\n_i.e._ for the four limbs 18.8 square cm. = about 3 square inches, and not\r\n78 square cm. or 12 square inches. By some unfortunate oversight Wallace\r\nmust have mixed up the total expanded area with that of the four hands and\r\nfeet! In Brehm's _Thierleben_ the 78 square cm. have increased to 81 cm.,\r\nand the artist has in the somewhat larger species _Rh. reinwardti_ improved\r\nupon this, and has produced a truly startling picture by a further\r\nexaggeration based upon the figure given by Wallace.\r\n\r\n_Rh. reinwardti_ lives in the forests of the mountains of Java and Sumatra.\r\nIt reaches 3 inches in length, and is grass-green above, yellow below.\r\nYounger specimens are further adorned with large blue patches on the webs\r\nof the hands and feet and behind the armpits. Besides the flap on the heel\r\nand the curious cutaneous fringe on the forearm, suggestive of an incipient\r\nflying-membrane, the skin forms a projecting fringe on the inner side of\r\nthe fifth toe and a transverse flap above the vent.\r\n\r\nOf _Rh. leucomystax_, Annandale, who accompanied the Skeat Expedition to\r\nMalacca, gives the following account:–\"This frog, which is called by the\r\nMalays of Lower Siam either 'Berkata Pisang' (banana-frog) or 'Berkata\r\nRhumah' (house-frog), lays its eggs either on leaves of branches\r\noverhanging the water, or on the mud surrounding buffalo-wallows. The ova\r\nare enclosed in a round mass of yellow froth, which afterwards becomes\r\nsteel-grey, about as large as a cricket-ball. Should they be placed\r\njudiciously in a position sheltered from the sun, the tadpoles may either\r\nhatch, and reach a considerable degree of development, before the mass is\r\nwashed into the water, or the froth may be melted almost as soon as it is\r\nformed and the eggs be carried into a pool by a shower of rain. Very often,\r\nhowever, the whole mass is dried up by the heat of the sun before the rain\r\ncomes. During the breeding season, which seems to occur as often as the\r\nland is flooded under the trees, for I have never seen the eggs of this\r\nfrog on the bank of a river, the {248}males croak loudly, producing a sound\r\nwhich can hardly be distinguished from the chattering of the large black\r\nand yellow squirrel, _Sciurus bicolor_.\"\r\n\r\nThese arboreal frogs have a peculiar mode of nursing the young and taking\r\ncare of the eggs. _Rh. maculatus_ of Ceylon, Malacca, etc., and _Rh.\r\nschlegeli_ of Japan, lay their eggs in a foamy mass, the size of a fist, on\r\nthe margins of ponds, and the whole process has recently been described by\r\nIkeda.[111] He observed the Japanese _Rh. schlegeli_ depositing the eggs in\r\nsoft, muddy ground covered with grass, and in wet, muddy banks of\r\npaddy-fields, ponds, and similar localities near Tokyo. Sometimes they are\r\ndeposited between the leaves of trees, near the ground. The breeding season\r\nextends from the middle of April to the middle of May. Towards the evening\r\nthe female, bearing the much smaller male on her back, retires underground\r\nfor the deposition of the eggs. The spots chosen are 10-15 cm. above the\r\nsurface of the water; the female digs a spherical hole 6-9 cm. wide.\r\nSitting thus concealed underground, the frogs assume a dark colour and the\r\nspawning takes place during the night, whereupon the parents leave the\r\nnest. The eggs are enveloped in a white mass of jelly full of air-bubbles,\r\nthe whole frothy lump looking like the well-beaten white of a hen's egg,\r\nwith the yellowish eggs scattered through it, and measuring some 6 cm. in\r\ndiameter. The air-bubbles are 2-3 mm. large. The froth is originally very\r\nelastic and sticky, but it gradually sinks down, becomes liquid and\r\nultimately runs out of the hole. It is produced in the following peculiar\r\nmanner. During and after the deposition of the eggs the female puts her\r\nfeet upon the sticky jelly, part of which adheres and is then pulled out as\r\na thin, transparent membrane stretching between both feet. The latter are\r\nthen thrust backwards, the membrane is folded downwards and becomes a\r\nvesicle of 5 to 10 mm. in width. By repeated working of the limbs the\r\nsuccessively formed bubbles are trodden and kneaded into froth, which\r\nultimately surrounds and at the same time separates the eggs.\r\n\r\nThe female of _Rh. reticulatus_ of Ceylon attaches the eggs, about twenty\r\nin number, to the under surface of her belly, on the skin of which they\r\nleave little cellular impressions. What becomes of the tadpoles is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n{249}_Rh. leucomystax_ is found in the Malay Archipelago, Farther India,\r\nand the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nS. S. Flower[112] found the tadpoles about Singapore, from January to\r\nApril, in small ponds and in rain-water butts. The spiracle lies on the\r\nleft side, directed backwards and upwards, nearer the anus than the end of\r\nthe snout. The anus opens on the right side. Exceptionally large tadpoles\r\nmeasured 46 mm. in total length, the recently transformed young only 14-18\r\nmm.\r\n\r\n\"A cheerful little frog of most graceful build. It comes out from its\r\nhiding-places shortly before sunset, and remains abroad all night. The\r\nmales are easily found as they sit on shrubs or trees, or on the edges of\r\nthe rain-water butts under the verandahs of the houses, and from time to\r\ntime utter a single, rather musical, short croak. In March and April they\r\ncan be found both by day and night in embrace, in the ponds. This species\r\nchanges both its colour and markings very rapidly and frequently, but dark\r\nbands across the legs can always be more or less distinguished; the lower\r\nparts are some shade or other of buff, but the principal variations of the\r\nupper part are as follows: pale bronze, either uniform or with four\r\nlongitudinal dark-brown or black lines; uniform, almost orange, bright\r\nbronze; chocolate, with darker mottling; pale brownish green or olive, with\r\nirregular dark spots; yellowish green, mottled with darker or brown.\" The\r\nfemales are considerably larger than the males; the largest male caught was\r\n48 mm. from snout to vent, and the largest female 68 mm.\r\n\r\n_Rana._–The following combination of characters should be a sufficient\r\ndiagnosis: pupil horizontal; tongue deeply notched and free behind; vomers\r\nwith teeth; fingers free, toes webbed, fourth and fifth metatarsals\r\ndiverging and webbed together.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the great number of species and the wide distribution of\r\nthis genus some of the organs vary considerably, indeed so much so that\r\nmany of these modifications have been deemed sufficient to be of generic\r\nimportance. Fortunately the species are so numerous that these characters\r\nmostly form an uninterrupted series from one extreme to the other.\r\n\r\nThe terminal phalanges are mostly simple and pointed; sometimes\r\ntransversely dilated or T-shaped, according to the presence of more or less\r\ndeveloped discs. Such discs are, for {250}instance, present in the Malay\r\nspecies _R. erythraea_ and _R. chalconota_ and in the Indian _R.\r\ncorrugata_. The tympanum occurs in every stage from a conspicuous, free\r\ndisc to being quite hidden by the skin. The vomerine teeth either form a\r\npair of tiny, mostly transverse rows, between the choanae, or they are\r\narranged in two oblique series which extend beyond the hinder edges of the\r\nchoanae.\r\n\r\nThe vocal sacs vary greatly. Many species, e.g. _R. agilis_, have none at\r\nall. Most species have a pair of internal sacs, and in comparatively few,\r\nabout a dozen, these sacs have become external, a feature which indicates\r\nno relationship of the species thus distinguished, for instance the\r\nEuropean _R. esculenta_, the Japanese _R. rugosa_, the Indian _R.\r\nhexadactyla_, _R. cyanophlyctis_ and _R. Chloronota_, the Bornean _R.\r\nglandulosa_, the African _R. oxyrhynchus_ and _R. mascareniensis_, the\r\nMexican _R. montezumae_. In _R. esculenta_, and perhaps in a few others,\r\neven the female has some traces of these otherwise male organs, indicated\r\nby slit-like folds of the outer skin below the angles of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nNuptial excrescences on the inner metacarpal tubercle and on the inner\r\nfingers of the male are common; they reach their greatest development in\r\nthe Himalayan _R. liebigi_, the male of which is \"remarkable for the\r\nextreme thickness of its arms, the inner sides of which are studded with\r\nsmall conical black spines, each supported on a rounded base produced by a\r\nswelling of the skin. A large patch of similar spines exists on each side\r\nof the breast.\"[113]\r\n\r\nSpecific glandular complexes in the skin are mostly restricted to a pair of\r\nlateral or dorso-lateral folds; they are often absent, but a few species,\r\ne.g. _R. glandulosa_ of Borneo, _R. temporalis_ of Ceylon, _R. elegans_ and\r\n_R. albolabris_ of West Africa, have a pair of large flat glands at the\r\nbase or inner side of the arms.\r\n\r\nAll the species of _Rana_, except those in the Solomon Islands, spawn in\r\nthe water, where the development of the tadpoles takes its course. Those of\r\nsome Indian species, notably _R. alticola_ and _R. afghana_ of the\r\nHimalayas, and _R. curtipes_ of Malabar, are very peculiar, being provided\r\non either side of the shoulders with a large oval parotoid-like gland, well\r\ndefined and crowded with pores; _R. alticola_ possesses in addition an\r\nunpaired, sharply {251}marked glandular complex on the top of the root of\r\nthe tail, or rather upon the future coccyx. These complexes gradually\r\ndisappear with age.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Rana_, with about 140 species and subspecies, is distributed\r\nover the whole of Arctogaea so far as this is available for Amphibian life,\r\nwhile there are only a few stragglers in Notogaea, namely, a few species in\r\nEcuador and in the Peruvian or Upper Amazon district. None exist in the\r\nrest of the Neotropical region, including the Antilles, and practically\r\nnone in Australia; but _R. arfaki_ and _R. papua_ inhabit New Guinea and\r\nthe northern corner of Australia, _R. kreffti_ the Solomon Islands. A few\r\nspecies are restricted to Madagascar, and a few others live there and on\r\nthe continent of Africa.\r\n\r\nSo far as number of species is concerned, the home of the genus _Rana_ is\r\nthe Palaeotropical region; about one dozen (some of them with a very wide\r\nrange) live in the Palaearctic sub-region, scarcely more in the Nearctic\r\nsub-region, and a few in Central America.\r\n\r\n_R. temporaria_ (the common European Brown Frog or Grass-frog).–The\r\ntympanum is distinct, two-thirds the diameter of the eye in size. The first\r\nfinger is slightly longer than the second, which is shorter and weaker than\r\nthe others, whilst the fourth is the longest. All the fingers are quite\r\nfree. When the hind-limbs are laid forwards along the body, the ankle-joint\r\nreaches to a point between the eye and the tip of the snout. The five toes,\r\nwhich are about half webbed, increase in length from the first to the\r\nfourth, while the fifth is about equal to the third. The sole of the foot\r\nhas a small, blunt, inner metatarsal tubercle; the outer one is scarcely\r\nvisible. The skin is smooth, always moist, owing to the minute mucous\r\nglands; but a series of larger glands forms a pair of folds along the upper\r\nsides of the back; beginning behind the eyes they converge slightly beyond\r\nthe shoulders, diverge a little in the sacral region, and converge again\r\ntowards the vent. Another, much feebler, Λ-shaped ridge lies between the\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\nThe male has two internal vocal sacs, which, when in use, bulge out the\r\nskin of the throat beneath the angles of the mouth like a pair of globes.\r\nIt is further distinguished from the female by the stronger muscles of the\r\narms and by a pair of swollen pads on the inner side of the first finger.\r\nDuring the pairing {252}season these pads are enlarged into cushions\r\ncovered with black horny rugosities.\r\n\r\nThe iris is golden, with dark specks. The coloration is, generally\r\nspeaking, brown above, with black-brown irregular spots, especially on the\r\nsides of the body, and with cross-bands on the legs. The under parts of the\r\nmale are white or pale yellow, with a bluish tinge on the throat, while the\r\nfemale is more yellow instead of white, inclining to orange. In both sexes\r\nthe under parts are mostly spotted with darker colours. A large dark-brown\r\npatch, extending from behind the eye over the tympanum towards the\r\nshoulder, is always present and has given this frog its specific name.\r\nOtherwise the coloration varies considerably; more or less according to the\r\nlocality and nature of the surroundings, and to individual variation and\r\ntemporary change of colour.\r\n\r\nSome specimens are almost spotless above and of a rich brown, or almost\r\nyellow colour, the spots being restricted to the sides below the lateral\r\nfolds. Others have very few spots, but these are then arranged in two\r\ninterrupted streaks on the back. The under parts, especially the flanks,\r\nmay be lemon yellow instead of whitish, and the darker markings may be\r\nalmost absent. Boulenger has figured a beautiful specimen, almost orange\r\nred, with red spots and vermiculations on the yellow under surface. I have\r\nfound similar red specimens of unusually striking appearance between Berlin\r\nand Spandau in a forest-glade, through which run little streams with banks\r\nof red ferruginous soil. Specimens which live in woods with rich black soil\r\nare often very dark, all the brown and reddish tints being absent. The\r\nvariations are, however, really endless, and it is difficult to find two\r\nindividuals exactly alike, even amongst a great number collected in the\r\nsame locality. Moreover, they change colour. Warmth makes them paler, cold\r\ncauses the chromatophores to expand and the whole frog appears darker.\r\nDuring the breeding season the males assume a delicate bluish hue,\r\nespecially on the throat, but this film quickly fades away when they are\r\ntaken out of the water. It is caused by the swelling of the cutaneous\r\nlymph-spaces which extend their ramifications into the epidermal layer, and\r\nit is not a question of pigmentation or of chromatophores, but a case of\r\ninterference-colours, blue being frequently the result of the light passing\r\nthrough a cloudy, colourless, but not {253}quite transparent and thin\r\nstratum, in this case the turgid epidermis.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the Grass-frog are essentially terrestrial. It spends most of\r\nits time on land, preferably in damp places, but local fashion permits of a\r\ngreat deal of freedom, as these frogs are sometimes found not only in very\r\nwet, naturally irrigated places, but also in the water itself. However, the\r\nGrass-frog when pursued rarely takes to the water for safety. It trusts to\r\nflight, first by a few long and fast jumps, and then to concealment by\r\nsquatting down between grass, under leaves; it rarely creeps into a hole,\r\neven if there be one near. The jumps soon become shorter and shorter after\r\na few dozen repetitions. It swims well, but cannot climb. The food, which\r\nconsists chiefly of insects, snails, and worms, must be moving to excite\r\ninterest; then the frog, whose favourite position is half squatting, half\r\nsupported by the arms, erects itself, and, facing the insect, turns round\r\nupon its haunches, adjusts its position anew by a shifting of the legs, and\r\nbetrays its mental agitation by a few rapid movements of the throat. All\r\nthis time the prey is watched intently until it moves; then there follows a\r\njump, a flap of the tongue and the insect is seen no more. As a rule these\r\nfrogs do not crawl, they jump or hop, even whilst stalking, and this takes\r\nplace at any time of the day; in fact they are very diurnal, although they\r\nbecome more active towards the evening. When caught they are at first very\r\nwild and, like all true frogs, very impetuous, committing acts of\r\nastonishing stupidity without any apparent sense or appreciation of\r\ndistance or height. The captive will not only jump off the table, whilst a\r\ntoad stops at the edge and looks carefully down, but without hesitation he\r\njumps out of the window, regardless of the height above the ground. This is\r\ndue to sheer fright; he loses his head. When at large in his native\r\nsurroundings, nothing will induce him, although hotly pursued, to commit\r\nsuicide by jumping down a precipice. But all this wildness calms down\r\nwonderfully soon. The captive no longer dashes his head against the glass,\r\nhe does not struggle or twist when taken up; on the contrary, he makes\r\nhimself at home, watches your coming with intense expectation, and without\r\nhesitation accepts the proffered mealworm, maggot, butterfly or earthworm;\r\nin short, he shows what a jolly and intelligent fellow he really is.\r\n\r\n{254}The Grass-frog has many more obvious enemies than perhaps any other\r\nAmphibian, and it is not even slightly protected by any appreciable\r\npoisonous secretion. Nevertheless it is extremely common. A whole host of\r\nbirds eat it–for instance, buzzards, harriers, and above all storks. Foxes,\r\npolecats, and stoats are not averse to it, and the Grass-snake derives its\r\nmain sustenance from it. In fact the enemies of the little frog are legion,\r\none of the worst being Man. In France, Italy, and other parts of the\r\nContinent, the skinned fleshy hind-limbs are turned into a by no means\r\ndisagreeable ragoût, or into dainty morsels when fried in butter and\r\nencrusted with bread-crumbs. This frog, together with its cousin the\r\nWater-frog, also suffers from the distinction of being one of the chief\r\nmartyrs to science. Perhaps the story is true that Galvani was led to his\r\ninvestigations into animal magnetism and electricity by observing that the\r\nlegs of a number of skinned frogs, strung up by his wife upon the bronze\r\nrailings of the balcony, jumped whenever the scissors, which cut off the\r\nfeet, touched the other metal. Frogs have suffered ever since. Easily\r\nprocured and of a convenient size, they are used in every biological\r\nlaboratory, and the young student is supposed to be initiated into the\r\nmysteries of Vertebrate structure by the careful dissection and study of\r\nthis, the worst of all the so-called types. Next to Man there is no animal\r\nwhich has been studied so minutely, and has had so many primers and\r\ntext-books written on it, as this frog. In spite of all this it is very\r\nlittle understood, thanks to its rather aberrant and far from generalised\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nHowever, the frog, by reason of its fertility, holds its own. Early in the\r\nyear, sometimes while there is still ice and snow, the frogs leave their\r\nhibernating places (mostly holes in the ground, under moss, or in the mud),\r\nand they begin to pair in standing or slowly flowing, mostly shallow,\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThey are not always very careful in the selection of the spawning locality,\r\nmany of them lay their eggs in a ditch, or even in the shallowest puddle,\r\nwhich is sure to dry up, and thus to cause the destruction of the whole\r\nbrood. This carelessness is all the more surprising when there are large\r\npools or lakes in the immediate vicinity, perhaps only one hundred yards to\r\nthe other side of the road. The Natterjack is, by the way, equally\r\ncareless, while other toads and the tree-frogs are very circumspect.\r\n\r\n{255}[Illustration: FIG. 49.–_Rana temporaria._ Eight successive stages in\r\nthe development from the egg to the almost complete Frog, × 1.]\r\n\r\nBoth sexes can croak, and this sound is frequently produced under water;\r\nbut there are no regular concerts, although many collect in the same pond\r\nor spring, which is perhaps the only suitable place for miles around. The\r\nmale puts its arms around the chest of the female, behind her arms, and the\r\nembrace is so firm that nothing will induce him to loosen his hold. The\r\nprocess becomes an involuntary reflex-action, a cramp which may last for\r\ndays, or even for weeks, if sudden cold weather sets in, until the female\r\nis ready to expel the eggs, an act which is quick and soon over. The usual\r\ntime of spawning in Middle Europe is the month of March, earlier in warm,\r\nlater in cold seasons; in southern countries, February or even January, but\r\nin Norway not until May. Although the males of this species are not more\r\nnumerous than the females, and therefore should be able to mate without\r\nmuch trouble, their ardour is so great that they occasionally get hold not\r\nonly of the wrong kind of frogs, but of toads or even fishes, and, if taken\r\noff by force, they fasten on to anything else, a log or on to your own\r\nfingers. The eggs measure 2-3 mm. in diameter, are black with a whitish\r\nspot on the lower pole, number from 1000 to 2000, and sink at first to the\r\nbottom. Their gelatinous cover soon swells to a large globe more than 10\r\ncm. in width, and the whole mass, as large as a man's head, floats on the\r\nsurface, often stained with mud and other impurities. During the cold\r\nweather which often prevails in the spring, the dark brown larvae are slow\r\nin their development; and provided with rather large branched external\r\ngills and a well-developed tail, they wriggle about in the dissolving slime\r\nfor three or four weeks. Fischer Sigwart[114] has timed and measured them\r\nas follows.–The eggs were laid on the 10th of {256}March. On the 15th the\r\nlarvae were 4 mm. long and began to leave the eggs. On the 19th they\r\nmeasured, body 4, tail 9, total 13 mm.; on the 5th of April 10, 16, and 26\r\nmm. respectively. On the 13th of May they were 40 mm. long and the\r\nhind-limbs appeared; the fore-legs burst through on the 25th, when the\r\ntadpoles had reached their greatest length, namely 45 mm., the body\r\nmeasuring 15 mm. On the 31st of May they left the water, still provided\r\nwith a rather long tail of 20 mm., the total length being reduced to 35 mm.\r\nThe larvae of this set developed unusually fast, perhaps owing to\r\nartificial conditions. The whole development is, however, mostly finished\r\nin three months, so that the little stump-tailed baby-frogs swarm about\r\nwell before midsummer, and have time enough to grow to the size of 20 mm.\r\nor ¾ inch before they begin to hibernate in October.\r\n\r\nIn higher localities and in northern countries the tadpoles are sometimes\r\nobliged to winter in the unfinished condition.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the unusually hot summer of 1899 I found plenty of tadpoles on\r\nthe 10th of September in the tarns of the hills of North Wales, 1500 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea; while thousands of little frogs, with and\r\nwithout stumpy tails, were hopping about in the surrounding bogs. The water\r\nof these tarns is always very cool. Cold and rainy weather set in by the\r\nmiddle of the month, and on the 26th the tadpoles, all rather small,\r\nmeasuring only 35 mm., with the four limbs developed, but still with a\r\nbroad fin on the tail, had all settled down under stones at the bottom of\r\nthe now very cold water, prepared for hibernation. A few were taken home\r\nand kept in a glass vessel with water, cool, but less so than that of their\r\nnative tarns. Within two days they lost the fins on their tails; before the\r\nend of a week they left the water, and crawled on to the moss, and the\r\ntails were reduced to little stumps. By the 10th of October the\r\nmetamorphosis was complete, the little frogs measured only 13 mm. in length\r\nand showed no desire to hibernate in the genial atmosphere of the\r\ngreenhouse.\r\n\r\nThis species has a very wide distribution. It ranges from the west of\r\nIreland to the islands of Saghalin and Yezzo, being found everywhere in the\r\nenormous stretch of intervening countries, practically the whole of Central\r\nand Northern Europe and the middle belt of Asia. Its most northern extent\r\nis the whole of Sweden and Norway. I have found it to the east of the\r\n{257}Dovrefjeld, at an elevation of 4000 feet, well-nigh the snow-line. In\r\nconformity herewith it ascends the Italian Alps up to 10,000 feet. The\r\nsouthern limit in Europe is the Cantabrian range and the hilly province of\r\nGalicia. In the rest of the peninsula, in Italy and Lombardy, Greece and\r\nTurkey, and on the Mediterranean islands it is absent.\r\n\r\n_R. arvalis_ is often confounded with _R. temporaria_, as it differs from\r\nthe latter only by the following characters. The snout is rather more\r\npointed and is narrower; the inner metatarsal tubercle is large,\r\ncompressed, and hard; the dorso-lateral glandular folds are more prominent\r\nand the belly is white and immaculate; lastly, it scarcely reaches 3 inches\r\nin length, a size which is not rarely surpassed by the other species. There\r\nare also some differences in habits. _R. arvalis_ prefers moist, boggy,\r\nopen localities, and does not ascend beyond 2000 feet in Central Europe. It\r\npairs as a rule later in the spring and the eggs are smaller, only 1½-2 mm.\r\nin diameter; they do not swell up so much, and the whole mass does not\r\nfloat but remains at the bottom of the shallow water. The coloration much\r\nresembles that of _R. temporaria_, and is likewise subject to much\r\nvariation, except that the pale vertebral stripe is perhaps more common.\r\nThis species is distributed over the whole of Central Europe, Russia, and\r\nWestern Siberia, south of the 60th degree of latitude, living side by side\r\nwith _R. temporaria_. Between the rivers Elbe and Rhine it becomes\r\ndecidedly rare, and the latter river is practically its western boundary,\r\nwhile the Bavarian Alps and the Danube form its southern limits.\r\n\r\n_R. agilis_ is still more frequently confounded with both the two former\r\nspecies. It differs from either by the absence of the two internal vocal\r\nsacs of the male, and by the decidedly longer hind-limbs, the tibio-tarsal\r\njoint reaching often a little beyond the tip of the snout. The inner\r\nmetatarsal tubercle is as prominent as in _R. arvalis_. Total length up to\r\n3 inches. The prevailing colour of the upper parts is rather yellow or\r\npink-brown with few and small blackish spots; a Λ-shaped dark mark on the\r\nneck is often present, and the large dark patch on the temporal regions is\r\nalways conspicuous. The under parts are white, inclining to lemon yellow on\r\nthe flanks and thighs. The iris is golden yellow in its upper half, dark\r\nbrown in the lower half.\r\n\r\n{258}This species has a much smaller range than the first two:–from France\r\nthrough Middle and Southern Germany, Switzerland, and Lombardy to Hungary\r\nand Greece. The specific name refers to the quick and long leaps of this\r\npretty, or rather delicately coloured frog, which prefers woods and wooded\r\nglens to large open places. Their voice differs much from the croak of the\r\ncommon Brown Frog, and agrees with that of _R. arvalis_, which is\r\ntranscribed by Boulenger, who has kept them alive, as a rapidly uttered\r\n\"co-co-co,\" or \"cor-cor-cor.\" According to the same authority, the pairing\r\ntakes place as in _R. temporaria_, but is of much shorter duration, the\r\nfemales usually resorting to the water only at night and when quite ready\r\nto spawn. Specimens in embrace are therefore seldom found in the daytime.\r\nThe eggs resemble those of _R. temporaria_ in size, but they do not swell\r\nup so much and they do not float.\r\n\r\nThese three species of European brown frogs, difficult enough to\r\ndistinguish, have of late been increased by three more, thanks to the\r\nsagacity of Boulenger. These latter inhabit South Europe, and the males all\r\nlack the internal vocal sacs.\r\n\r\n_R. iberica_ has a very small range, namely the north-western portion of\r\nthe Iberian peninsula, from the Tagus northwards into Galicia, but south of\r\nthe main extension of the Cantabrian chain. The rest of the Peninsula south\r\nof these mountains has no brown frogs, the only species of _Rana_ being _R.\r\nesculenta_. _R. iberica_ is rather local, being restricted to those hilly\r\nand mountainous districts which are well watered. A favourite haunt is the\r\nnumerous streams in the wooded parts of the Serra Gerez, the red,\r\ndisintegrated granite of which suits this little, extremely active, and\r\nreddish frog to perfection. The prevailing ground-colour varies according\r\nto the district, from pale to dark reddish or orange brown, with red specks\r\nand larger, dark brown spots, which in some specimens begin with the\r\nΛ-shaped mark between the shoulders. Dark spots on the flanks are very\r\nvariable; the hind-limbs show the usual darker cross-bars, and the temporal\r\nregion has the conspicuous dark patch. The ground-colour of the under parts\r\nis whitish, suffused with a pink tinge, and the throat is much speckled\r\nwith brown; the toes are pink. The size of this pretty frog amounts to 2\r\ninches. The breeding time is the month of March. When caught and squeezed\r\nthey emit a slight \"co-co-co.\"\r\n\r\n{259}_R. graeca_ inhabits Italy and the Balkan peninsula from Rosina to\r\nMorea, together with _R. agilis_, from which it is very difficult to\r\ndistinguish except that it is a little smaller, remaining below 2½ inches,\r\nand is generally more uniformly pale grey brown to yellowish and pinkish\r\nbrown above, with scarcely any, or only a few, small dark specks on the\r\nback and limbs. The temporal patch is likewise paler than in the other\r\nspecies. The flanks are spotless, their colour gradually passing into the\r\nlight buff of the under parts, which are more or less marbled with grey.\r\nThe iris is golden, speckled with dark brown.\r\n\r\n_R. latastei_ of Lombardy and Northern Italy down to Florence is the last\r\nof these closely allied frogs. Its affinities lie with _R. iberica_ and _R.\r\nagilis_. The latter and _R. latastei_, although living side by side in the\r\nsame locality, for instance near Turin, are said not to interbreed. The\r\nvoice is a rapidly uttered \"keck-keck-keck;\" the length remains below 2½\r\ninches. The ground colour is greyish or reddish brown with a dark brown\r\nΛ-shaped mark between the shoulders, and a few red, orange, or blackish\r\nspots on the back. The flanks are without definite dark spots. The under\r\nparts are whitish, with a strong pink tinge, especially along the middle of\r\nthe throat and on the chest, the paler portions being mottled with pale\r\ngrey brown.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the least unsatisfactory way of distinguishing between _R. agilis_,\r\n_R. graeca_, and _R. latastei_ (_R. iberica_ need not be confounded with\r\nthem on account of its distribution) is the size of the tympanum, and its\r\ndistance from the eye. The tympanum is smallest in _R. graeca_, its\r\ndiameter being about half that of the eye and from ¾ to the whole of its\r\nwidth distant from the eye. In _R. latastei_ the tympanum is a little\r\nlarger, and about ½ to ⅔ its own width distant from the eye. _R. agilis_\r\nhas the largest tympanum, measuring about ¾ of the diameter of the eye, and\r\nthe distance between the two organs amounts to only ⅓ of the size of the\r\ntympanum.\r\n\r\nBrown land-frogs of the _R. temporaria_ group are found in most countries\r\nof nearly the whole Periarctic and Oriental regions, and by the time their\r\nraces and varieties have been studied as minutely as those of Europe are\r\nnow being scrutinised, the number of species will indeed be great.\r\n\r\n_R. silvatica_ is the chief representative in North America. It closely\r\nresembles _R. agilis_, but is smaller, only 2 inches in length, {260}and\r\npossesses a pair of internal vocal sacs. Its specific name refers to its\r\npredilection for forests of oak, among the dried leaves of which it\r\nconceals itself so successfully that it is discovered with difficulty. _R.\r\njaponica_ of Eastern Asia is almost indistinguishable from this American\r\nspecies and from the European _R. agilis_.\r\n\r\n_R. opisthodon_ of the Solomon Islands has the vomerine teeth in two\r\noblique series entirely behind the level of the choanae. The general shape\r\nof this large frog is stout, the type specimen of the male measuring 78,\r\nthat of the female 125 mm. = 5 inches. The upper surface of the female is\r\ncovered with small, flat warts, that of the male is much smoother. The\r\nupper parts are dark brown, while the under surface is brownish white. The\r\nmale has two internal vocal sacs.\r\n\r\nThis species is interesting as affording another instance of shortened\r\ndevelopment, the whole metamorphosis being gone through within the egg. Mr.\r\nGuppy, its discoverer, has supplied the following notes: \"During a descent\r\nfrom one of the peaks of Faro Island I stopped at a stream some 400 feet\r\nabove the sea, where my native boys collected from the moist crevices of\r\nthe rocks close to the water a number of transparent gelatinous balls,\r\nrather smaller than a marble. Each of these balls contained a young frog,\r\nabout 4 inches in length, apparently fully developed, with very long\r\nhind-legs and short fore-legs, no tail, and bearing on the sides of the\r\nbody small tufts of what seemed to be branchiae. On my rupturing the ball\r\nor egg in which the little animal was doubled up the tiny frog took a\r\nmarvellous leap into its existence, and disappeared before I could catch\r\nit. On reaching the ship an hour after, I found that some of the eggs which\r\nI had put in a tin had been ruptured on the way by the jolting, and the\r\nliberated frogs were leaping about with great activity. On placing some of\r\nthem in an open-mouthed bottle, 8 inches long, I had to put the cover on,\r\nas they kept leaping out.\"\r\n\r\nBoulenger[115] has figured and further described the eggs and young. The\r\negg measures 6-10 mm. in diameter, and is a transparent capsule in which\r\nthe young frog is coiled up in the same way as figured by Peters in\r\n_Hylodes martinicensis_; but none of the specimens, which are in an\r\nadvanced stage of development, show anything of a tail. There are no gills,\r\nbut on each side {261}of the abdomen are several regular transverse folds,\r\nthe function of which is probably that of breathing organs, like the tail\r\nof _Hylodes_. The tip of the snout is furnished with a small conical\r\nprotuberance projecting slightly through the delicate envelope of the egg,\r\nand evidently used to perforate that envelope.\r\n\r\n_R. guppyi_, likewise an inhabitant of the Solomon Islands, is a giant\r\namong frogs. It was discovered by Mr. Guppy on the Shortland Islands. The\r\ntype-specimen measures 165 mm. = 6½ inches in length! The skin of the upper\r\nparts is covered with minute warts, and forms a strong fold above the\r\ndistinct, but small, tympanum. General colour dark olive brown above, dirty\r\nwhite below.\r\n\r\n_R. tigrina_ is a common species of Eastern Asia, including the Malay\r\nIslands. On account of the strength of its voice, and its size, which is\r\nsaid to reach 7 inches, it is called the \"Indian Bullfrog.\" Mainly aquatic,\r\nit has a strong cutaneous fringe along the outer side of the fifth toe. The\r\nskin of the back is thrown into longitudinal folds, and a strong fold marks\r\nthe upper border of the tympanum. The general colour above is olive brown,\r\nwith dark spots, often with a light vertebral line; the under parts are\r\nwhite. The male has a pair of large external vocal sacs.\r\n\r\n_R. gracilis_ has the same distribution, but it remains much smaller, and\r\nthe toes are only half, instead of fully, webbed.\r\n\r\n_R. catesbiana_ is now the settled name of _the_ \"Bullfrog\" of North\r\nAmerica, the much more appropriate name of _mugiens_ having been sacrificed\r\nto the fetish of priority. The tympanum is extraordinarily large, at least\r\nequal to the size of the eye, largest in the male. The first finger does\r\nnot extend beyond the second; the toes are connected by a broad web down to\r\nthe ends, and there is a small inner, but no outer, metatarsal tubercle.\r\nThe upper parts are olive brown, clouded with dark brown or blackish spots;\r\nthe under parts are yellowish white, often marbled with brown, especially\r\non the throat. The iris is reddish, with an outer yellow ring. The male\r\npossesses two internal vocal sacs. Total length of adult specimens about 5\r\ninches, but there are giants on record 7 inches in length, while the\r\nstretched hind-limbs measure another 9 or 10 inches. Its home extends over\r\nthe whole of the United States, East of the {262}Rocky Mountains,\r\nsouthwards into Mexico, northwards into Canada.\r\n\r\nAccording to Holbrook the Bullfrogs are solitary in their habits, only\r\ncollecting together in the breeding season, when hundreds may be seen in\r\nthe same small pond; and then the croak uttered by the males is so loud as\r\nto resemble the distant roaring of a bull, and can be heard on still\r\nevenings at a distance of half a mile. The voice is a hoarse bass \"brwoom,\"\r\nplayfully translated into \"more rum.\" \"They cannot be said to abound, but\r\nare found commonly enough sitting half immersed in water, or on the banks\r\nof ponds, waiting for their prey. If alarmed they hop suddenly into the\r\nwater, but do not conceal themselves at once, frequently skimming along the\r\nsurface for several yards before they dive below.\" They are the most\r\naquatic of all the North American frogs, and Holbrook has known specimens\r\nto live in wells for years, where they could not rest a moment on solid\r\nground above the water.\r\n\r\nThe Bullfrog is voracious, and takes almost anything that lives or gets\r\ninto his own pond–Mollusca, Crustacea, fishes and, above all, frogs. There\r\nis no doubt that they drag down and swallow a good many ducklings and the\r\nyoung of other water-fowl, but certainly not the half-grown birds which\r\nhave a way of disappearing from the farms wherever there are negroes and\r\nother farm-hands about. In turn the bullfrog has sufficient enemies to keep\r\nits numbers down, in fishes, birds, otters, and snakes, and, in the South,\r\nalligators. Although easily kept and growing comparatively tame, they are\r\ndull, having to be kept in solitary confinement on account of their\r\ngreediness, which knows no limits. Two of our specimens each swallowed a\r\nfull-grown _Salamandra maculosa_, and died within the same night, probably\r\nnot understanding the meaning of the conspicuous black and yellow warning\r\ncolours of the European.\r\n\r\n_E. clamata_ s. _fontinalis_, likewise an inhabitant of Eastern North\r\nAmerica, may be called a smaller edition of the Bullfrog, its usual\r\nfull-grown size being about 3½ inches. The tympanum is conspicuously large,\r\nbut the toes are webbed to a lesser extent, and the skin forms a glandular\r\nfold which extends from the shoulder in a curve to the flank. This species\r\nis partial to the neighbourhood of running streams; it is said to be\r\n{263}exceedingly timid, and to utter a short cry when disturbed and making\r\nits enormous leaps.\r\n\r\nAnother North American relation is _R. halecina_ s. _palustris_,\r\nfrequenting the neighbourhood of ponds and rivers, very lively and capable\r\nof jumping 8 to 10 feet. The tympanum is smaller than the eye, but there is\r\nthe same glandular lateral fold as in _R. clamata_. The vocal sacs are\r\ninternal and decidedly small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.–_Rana clamata_, × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n_R. esculenta._–The common Water-frog of nearly the whole Palaearctic\r\nregion is closely allied to the American Water-frogs described above, and,\r\nlike most of them, has the vomerine teeth in two small oblique rows between\r\nthe choanae and extending a little beyond their posterior border. But the\r\nmales have a pair of external vocal sacs. The tympanum is distinct, about\r\ntwo-thirds the size of the eye. The first finger is slightly longer than\r\nthe second. The toes are entirely webbed. Besides the usual subarticular\r\nphalangeal tubercles, the sole of the foot is provided with two metatarsal\r\ntubercles, the outer of which is very small, while the inner is much\r\nlarger, although varying in size from a soft oval to a long, curved,\r\nshovel-shaped structure. The skin is smooth, except for a pair of prominent\r\nglandular folds which extend from behind the eye along the dorso-lateral\r\nline. The coloration varies considerably. The upper parts are mostly\r\ngreenish brown, with black brown spots on the back, and larger patches on\r\nthe limbs. Most specimens have three lighter stripes along the back, the\r\nmiddle one mostly green, the two lateral bronzy brown and coinciding with\r\nthe glandular folds. The tympanum is brown, and there is occasionally a\r\ndark temporal patch. The posterior aspect of the thighs is invariably\r\n{264}spotted with black and white or yellow, in opposition to the _R.\r\ntemporaria_ group, where these parts are never spotted.\r\n\r\nThe total length of this species varies much. Specimens 2½ inches in length\r\nare certainly mature, those of 4 inches are unusually large, and Boulenger\r\nhas received a giant from Damascus, which measured 125 mm., or nearly 5\r\ninches. The females are larger than the males.\r\n\r\nThe variations in colour are not only local but also individual, moreover\r\nthe colours are changeable. The ground-tint ranges from dull brown through\r\nolive to bright green, the dark spots being more or less pronounced and\r\nnumerous; the light vertebral line is olive-yellowish, bright green, or\r\naltogether absent.\r\n\r\nThose which inhabit waters with plentiful vegetation, like water-lilies and\r\nother luxuriant plants, are generally prettier and more vividly coloured\r\nthan those which live in swamps and ponds with dark mud, or where the\r\nprevailing vegetation has a sombre aspect. Cold and dull, warm and sunny\r\ndays also influence the water-frogs, and those which have been kept in a\r\ndark tank look very different from the bright assembly which had been put\r\nin some weeks before.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made at subdividing _R. esculenta_ of Linnaeus\r\ninto sub-species, and Boulenger has now, after the attentive study of an\r\nenormous material, arranged them in four principal and recognisable races.\r\nThe chief differences are the relative length of the femur to the tibia and\r\nthe size of the metatarsal tubercles.\r\n\r\n1. Var. _ridibunda_, Pallas.–The right and left heels overlap each other\r\nwhen the thighs are stretched out at right angles to the vertebral column,\r\nand the tibia is closely folded up against the thighs. When stretched\r\nforwards, the heel reaches the eye or even the tip of the snout. The inner\r\nmetatarsal tubercle is feebly developed, very small and blunt; the outer\r\ntubercle is absent.\r\n\r\nThat part of the thighs which is concealed by the legs when the animal is\r\nat rest is whitish or pale greenish, marbled with dark olive, or bronze, or\r\nof the latter colour with or without small light spots. No trace of yellow\r\nis ever to be detected on that region, nor at the axillae or on the groin.\r\nThe vocal sacs are strongly pigmented with black, when inflated they are\r\npale grey. The iris is a mixture of black and gold.\r\n\r\n{265}This form or race has the widest distribution, namely, all over Europe\r\nwith the exception of England, the northern half of France, the Rhine\r\ncountries, Denmark, and Italy. Southwards it extends from France through\r\nSpain and Portugal into the Sahara, eastwards into Turkestan. It attains a\r\nlarger size than the others, but only in certain localities in various\r\ncountries, where circumstances favour its development. Eastern countries\r\nproduce the largest of all; those of the Volga are said to be very large.\r\nGerman physiological laboratories prefer those from the Danube, from\r\nBohemia, and from the lakes and broad expansions of the Spree, to specimens\r\nfrom other localities.\r\n\r\n2. Var. _typica_ (_esculenta_, Linnaeus).–The heels just meet, but do not\r\noverlap. The inner metatarsal tubercle is strong, compressed, and\r\nprominent. A small outer tubercle is present. The heel reaches to the eye\r\nor a little further; the hinder surface of the thighs is \"marbled with\r\nblack, usually with more or less bright yellow pigment\" in the living\r\nspecimens; the vocal sacs are white or feebly pigmented. This race inclines\r\nto rather more green than the others, the males especially are often dark\r\ngrass-green, with scarcely any markings. The vertebral stripe is then\r\nyellowish, and the lateral stripes almost golden. The range extends over\r\nthe whole of Central Europe and the kingdom of Italy. Its northern limit is\r\nthe southern end of Sweden. In the greater portion of Germany, Poland, and\r\nAustria it overlaps the var. _ridibunda_, with which it does not seem to\r\npair, owing to a difference in the time of spawning; the var. _typica_\r\nbeing about a fortnight later, and beginning to spawn when the other has\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n3. Var. _lessonae_, Camerano.–Except that the inner tubercle is stronger,\r\nwhile the outer one is near the vanishing point, and that the fourth toe is\r\nproportionally longer, this variety is really not distinguishable from the\r\ntypical form, and Boulenger himself confesses that the distinction is\r\narbitrary. The var. _lessonae_ seems to have a rather sporadic\r\ndistribution. It has been found in Piedmont and other parts of Italy, in\r\nHungary and Transylvania, near Vienna, Halle, Upper Bavaria, on the Rhine,\r\nnear Brussels, Paris, and what is of especial interest to us, in a few\r\nplaces in the eastern counties of England.\r\n\r\nAccording to Boulenger's \"Notes on the Edible Frog in England,\"[116] the\r\nindividuals of _R. esculenta_ which live in Foulmire {266}Fen in\r\nCambridgeshire, near Stow Bedon, and between Thetford and Scoulton in\r\nNorfolk, and are generally supposed to have been introduced from France,\r\nbelong to the Italian form of var. _lessonae_. \"It used to be found in\r\nCambridgeshire, in Foulmire Fen, where it was discovered in 1844; and\r\nBell[117] assures us that his father, who was a native of Cambridgeshire,\r\nhad noticed the presence of these frogs many years before at Whaddon and\r\nFoulmire, where they were known from their loud croak as 'Whaddon organs'\r\nand 'Dutch nightingales.' The species was afterwards rediscovered in\r\nNorfolk, between Thetford and Scoulton, where it is now still very\r\nabundant, and from inquiries made by Lord Walsingham, must have existed for\r\nthe last seventy (80) years at least. These frogs belong to the var.\r\n_lessonae_, and differ widely (by the much stronger inner metatarsal\r\ntubercle) from those found in a few other places in Norfolk, which are\r\nundoubtedly the descendants of a number imported from France and Belgium in\r\n1837, 1841, and 1842, and turned loose in the Fens at Foulden and in the\r\nneighbourhood.... Within the last ten years large numbers of all the three\r\nforms have been imported from Brussels, Berlin, and Italy, and liberated in\r\nvarious localities in West Surrey and Hampshire. Berlin specimens of the\r\nvar. _ridibunda_ have also been introduced in Bedfordshire, and Italian\r\nones in Oxfordshire.\"[118]\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the question whether the so-called var. _lessonae_ is merely\r\nsporadically developed out of the typical form, the inquiry of the possible\r\norigin of the English specimens of the var. _lessonae_ is of special\r\ninterest. Have they been introduced, as has been suggested, from Lombardy,\r\nor are they the last lingering descendants of native English frogs? The\r\nsuggestion as to their Italian origin has naturally lost in value since\r\nsimilar specimens have been found in Belgium and near Paris; but we must\r\nremember that there existed considerable intercourse between East Anglia\r\nand the monks of Lombardy, who, to mention only one instance, came\r\nregularly to the old Priory of Chesterton, near Cambridge, in order to\r\ncollect their rents. If the frogs were introduced by them for culinary\r\npurposes into various suitable localities their descendants would remain as\r\nlocal as they, and as the undoubtedly introduced French typical specimens\r\nactually are. On the other {267}hand, if we assume the _lessonae_ specimens\r\nto be the last living descendants of English natives, it is inconceivable\r\nwhy they should now be restricted to that eastern corner while there are\r\nhundreds of other suitable places in England and Wales which, if on the\r\nContinent, would be perfect paradises for Water-frogs. The same vegetation,\r\nthe same insects, the same climate, and–an enormous advantage to the\r\nfrogs–no storks.\r\n\r\nThese English specimens are \"olive-brown or bronzy-brown above, with black\r\nspots, strongly marked on the flanks, where a light longitudinal area\r\nremains unspotted; glandular folds lighter; the sides of the head and the\r\nground colour of the flanks are sometimes green; tympanum chestnut-brown; a\r\npale yellow or pale green vertebral line, frequently edged with black; the\r\ndark cross-bands on the limbs usually very irregular, sometimes absent;\r\nlower surfaces more or less profusely spotted with blackish; iris golden.\r\nLength of a male from Stow Bedon, 64 mm. or 2½ inches; of a female, 78 mm.\r\nor 3 inches.\"[119]\r\n\r\n4. Var. _chinensis_, Osb.–Distinguished by short glandular folds along the\r\nback, in addition to the long dorso-lateral pair. The metatarsal tubercle\r\nis large and shovel-shaped. Distribution from Corea and Japan to Siam.\r\n\r\nAll these Water-frogs are decidedly aquatic. They make short excursions on\r\nland when their homes are dried up, but as a rule they remain in the lake,\r\npond, river, morass, or ditch in which they were born. Their favourite\r\nresorts are the broad floating leaves of water-plants, for instance\r\nwater-lilies, or a prominent stone, a tussock of grass, or the banks of\r\ntheir homes, where they sit motionless, basking for hours in a half-erect,\r\nalert position, watching for insects and other small fry, which are secured\r\nby a jump, and then lapped up. Sunshine is sure to bring them out, and on\r\nour approach they make straight for the water, either by one tremendous\r\nleap or with quick bounds, but without the slightest hesitation or stopping\r\non the way. With folded arms they take a header, swim, with the arms still\r\nfolded, for some distance under water, and conceal themselves in the mud,\r\nbetween stones, or in the vegetation. We perhaps have not seen them at all,\r\nwhilst their watchful eyes and keen ears have noticed our approach, and the\r\npond might appear uninhabited if we had not heard the plumping noise. If we\r\n{268}keep quite still, and they have not been disturbed previously, one\r\nafter another will wriggle out of the mud, rise slowly to the surface under\r\ncover of the plants, and, without causing a ripple, rise just enough for\r\nthe prominent eyes and the nose to clear the surface. Then one scrambles\r\npartly on to a leaf, but the sight of the huge human figure strikes him as\r\nuncanny, as it certainly does not belong to the scenery, and he doubles\r\nback, the broadly-webbed feet making a little splash. But another appears,\r\njumps on to a leaf in the middle, or at the farther end of the pond,\r\nsettles down, and utters a little croak, somewhat like \"ooaar,\" and soon\r\nthe whole company appear one after another, each taking up its favourite\r\nposition. After all, their observing powers cannot be very great. If we\r\nourselves keep still we may wield a rod and fish for them. There is no need\r\nof a hook, a piece of red cloth tied to the end of the line and skimmed\r\nover the water causes a lively commotion. The new bait is noticed at once,\r\nand arouses their curiosity; several jump at it, and the one which swallows\r\nthe bait can be lifted out before it has time to let go. However, this is\r\nafter all poor sport; the game is too eager. When a boy I have often caught\r\nthem with a noose of slender wire at the end of a long hazel rod. They do\r\nnot mind the rod at all, their attention being fixed on the person; they\r\nallow the noose to be slipped over their heads, and a sudden jerk secures\r\nthe captive. In this way they can be singled out individually. Old frogs\r\nare more wary and experienced than the younger members; they take up safer\r\npositions, and by their sudden plunges give the alarm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.–_Rana esculenta._ × 1. Three stages of the movement\r\nof the tongue.]\r\n\r\nThe males are great musicians, singing for sheer enjoyment not only during\r\nthe pairing time, but throughout the months of June and July. Warm moonlit\r\nnights are the favourite times {269}for the concert, which takes place in\r\nthe water, beginning at sunset, and continuing until the early dawn. A few\r\nindividuals here and there utter a single note, \"gwarr, oo-arr,\" or\r\n\"coarx,\" but these are only preliminaries. The precentor–the country-folk\r\nin North Germany firmly believe that in each pond one old male holds the\r\ndignified position of choir-master–begins with a sharp-sounding \"brekeke,\"\r\nand this is the signal for all the others to chime in with the same notes,\r\nvaried with all sorts of other sounds, bass, tenor, and alto, each\r\nperformer filling its resounding vocal sacs to bursting size, and these\r\nbags then look as if they acted as floats. When there are several hundred\r\nof these sociable creatures, the din is continuous, and may be heard more\r\nthan a mile off. There can be too much of this, just as there can be too\r\nmany nightingales; and a well-stocked pond in the neighbourhood may become\r\na perfect nuisance. There are accounts of servants having been employed in\r\nthe Middle Ages for the sole purpose of keeping the noise down by beating\r\nthe pond, throwing stones into the water, or otherwise disturbing the\r\nfrogs. Sometimes more vigorous and lasting measures seem to have been\r\ntaken; the monks exorcised them in order not to be disturbed in their\r\nvigils. Near the former monastery of Chorin, in the province of\r\nBrandenburg, the frogs have still the reputation of keeping very quiet on\r\naccount of some powerful abbot who threatened them with awful consequences\r\nif they did not forego their concerts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.–_Rana esculenta._ Male with inflated external vocal\r\nsacs. × 1.]\r\n\r\nThe length of life which these frogs can attain is quite unknown. They do\r\nnot reach maturity until the fourth or fifth year, but this is long before\r\nthey stop growing, and it is no exaggeration to say that few, if any, frogs\r\ndie of old age, since they have so many enemies. The stork is their king in\r\nthe fable, and his daily visits to his realm strike dire distress amongst\r\nhis subjects, which soon learn to know his conspicuous white and black\r\ngarb, and seek imperfect safety at the bottom of shallow ponds and ditches,\r\nnot too deep for the long-legged and long-billed despot. Numbers are taken\r\nby birds of prey; snakes and tortoises hunt them up in the water, and they\r\nare good bait for pike and other voracious fishes. The specific {270}name\r\n_esculenta_ needs no comment, and this species is as much a martyr to\r\nscience as the brown Grass-frog. The destroyers of tadpoles and young frogs\r\nare unlimited. In their turn the frogs themselves, especially the old ones,\r\nare very rapacious, and eat any living creature they can master,–insects,\r\nworms and snails, other frogs, especially the brown kind, and the young\r\nbrood of fishes.\r\n\r\nRecently caught Water-frogs are wild beyond description, much more so than\r\nthe Grass-frog, but even they calm down after some time, learn to know\r\ntheir keeper, and allow him to handle them without trying to commit suicide\r\nby jumping on to, into, and down anything. However, they do not thrive well\r\nin captivity, and it is rare that they can be induced to breed, unless\r\ntheir enforced new home affords them ample freedom, and plenty of water and\r\nfresh air.\r\n\r\nThe Water-frogs appear in Germany rather late in the year, not before the\r\nmiddle of April, first the younger, then the adult members. In Southern\r\nEurope they show themselves earlier, and still further south they do not\r\nhibernate at all. The breeding season begins in Germany towards the end of\r\nMay and continues well into June, the var. _ridibunda_ beginning mostly a\r\nfortnight earlier. The male clasps the female under the arms, throwing its\r\nown round her breast, the nuptial grey excrescences on his inner fingers\r\npressing against her skin, the palms being turned outwards. The embrace\r\ndoes not last long, rarely extending over a few days. The eggs, to the\r\nastonishing number of 5000 to 10,000 in full-grown specimens, are expelled\r\nin several masses, which sink down and remain at the bottom. The eggs\r\nmeasure only 1.5 mm. and are yellowish-grey above, pale yellow below; their\r\ngelatinous cover swells to 7-8 mm. in width. The embryo escapes on the\r\nfifth or sixth day as a very small larva, in which, however, the mouth,\r\neyes, and beginnings of the external gills are already discernible. At the\r\nage of two weeks the gills have shrunk away, the left-sided \"spiracle\" is\r\ncompleted, and the well-tailed tadpoles, olive brown above, yellowish white\r\nbelow, still hang with their suckers on to plants and stones, or lie at the\r\nbottom, nibbling away at any rotting animal matter or scraping off the\r\ngreen algae.\r\n\r\nIt may here be mentioned that small tadpoles of any kind can with advantage\r\nbe used as cleaners of delicate and small {271}skeletons. The object is put\r\ninto a vessel, and the tadpoles will soon nibble and rasp away all the\r\nedible portions, leaving the skeletal framework beautifully cleaned. But\r\nthey require attention lest they rasp away the cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe tadpole stage lasts three to four months; but cold, absence of\r\nsunshine, and scarcity of food delay the metamorphosis well into the end of\r\nsummer, or force them to hibernate in the unfinished condition. They are\r\nvery gregarious, and when the tadpoles of several families combine, they\r\nmake imposing shows. By the time that their hind-limbs begin to sprout,\r\nthey frequently combine into large shoals, and instead of always feeding\r\nthey swim about in their tens of thousands, all moving in the same\r\ndirection, and making almost regular evolutions. Mill-ponds with steep\r\nbanks are good places for watching these peculiar habits. The tadpoles\r\nreach a considerable size, the total length averaging 2½ inches, or some 60\r\nmm. the tail taking up ⅔ of the whole length. Specimens which measure more\r\nthan 3 inches are rare. The baby-frogs hop on land while still provided\r\nwith a stumpy tail; when this is resorbed the little creature is scarcely\r\nhalf-an-inch long, and for the rest of the available season leads a rather\r\nmore terrestrial life than ever after.\r\n\r\n_Ex Africa semper aliquid novi!_ Quite recently Boulenger has received a\r\nconsignment of Anura from the French Congo, amongst which were several new,\r\nremarkable genera, notably _Trichobatrachus_ and _Gampsosteonyx_. Both are\r\ntrue Ranidae. Pupil vertical, with vomerine teeth. Omosternum with a bony\r\nstyle. The outer metatarsals are bound together. In _Trichobatrachus\r\nrobustus_ the toes are webbed, and both sexes have the flanks and\r\ncorresponding portions of the thighs covered with numerous darkly\r\npigmented, filamentous, cutaneous excrescences; these are several\r\nmillimeters in length, giving the flanks and thighs a \"hairy\" appearance.\r\nMr. F. F. Laidlaw has examined these structures. Their most remarkable\r\nfeature is the presence in them of a great number of ordinary flask-shaped\r\ncutaneous glands, whilst such glands are scarce on the surrounding skin.\r\nThey differ in no way from those seen in sections of the skin of the Common\r\nFrog. The fibrous connective tissue is dense and vascular; the\r\npigment-cells are most plentiful at the base. Contrary to expectation no\r\nnerve-endings were found in these filaments.\r\n\r\n{272}_Gampsosteonyx_ has free toes. The terminal joints of the digits stand\r\nout beyond the skin, and end in sharp, bony claws, like those of a cat.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 3. DENDROBATINAE.–About one dozen arboreal little frogs have been\r\nseparated from the Raninae proper on account of the entire absence of\r\nteeth. This mere loss of teeth, and the geographical distribution suggest\r\nthat these frogs do not form a natural group, but have been developed\r\nindependently from other Ranidae, the Neotropical _Dendrobates_ from some\r\nlikewise Neotropical genus like _Prostherapis_, the Malagasy _Mantella_\r\nfrom an African form like _Megalixalus_.\r\n\r\nThe sacral diapophyses are cylindrical. The omo- and meta-sternum are well\r\ndeveloped. The fingers and toes are free, their terminal phalanges are\r\nT-shaped and carry regular, round, adhesive discs. The tympanum is\r\ndistinct, although sometimes, in _Dendrobates_, very small. The pupil is\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\n_Dendrobates._–The tongue is elongate, entire and free behind. The\r\nomosternum has a weak, semi-ossified style, but the metasternum remains\r\ncartilaginous. The males have a subgular vocal sac. Seven closely-allied\r\nspecies inhabit tropical America.\r\n\r\n_D. tinctorius._–This pretty little species, scarcely 1½ inch in length, is\r\nquite smooth, varies much in coloration, and forms local races to a certain\r\nextent. Some are quite black, others are grey above, black on the sides and\r\nunder parts; or they are grey with large black patches. A fourth variety is\r\nblack above with several white or pink longitudinal stripes, while the\r\nunder parts are grey, spotted with black. In others, again, the\r\nground-colour is black, with white stripes and spots above, marbled below.\r\nBut this enumeration does not exhaust the list, since living specimens are\r\nsometimes much more conspicuously coloured, some being black with large\r\npatches of saturated yellow on the head and back, while the limbs are\r\norange red and black. This species has a wide range, from Panama to Ecuador\r\nand to the mouth of the Amazon. It owes its specific name to the peculiar\r\nuse made by man of the strongly poisonous secretion of the tiny glands of\r\nthe otherwise smooth skin. Other species are doubtless employed in the same\r\nway. The poison is mainly used for \"dyeing\" the green Amazon-parrots. This\r\nis done as follows:–The green and blue feathers on the head and neck, or\r\nother parts, according to the fancy of the {273}operator, are plucked out,\r\nand these places are rubbed with the poison, often simply with the living\r\nfrog, certainly not with its blood, as is sometimes asserted. This\r\noperation may be repeated when the new, young feathers begin to bud. The\r\nresult is that these appear yellow instead of green, and since the\r\nBrazilians, and to a certain extent the Portuguese, are rather partial to\r\nthese artificially-produced freaks or \"contrafeitos\" as they call them, the\r\nindustry is kept up. That the poison is also used for arrows has been\r\nmentioned on p. 38.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.–_Dendrobates tinctorius_, three colour-variations.\r\n× 1.]\r\n\r\n_D. trivittatus_, chiefly in Northern Brazil, has the first finger slightly\r\nlonger than the second. It likewise varies considerably in its coloration,\r\nbeing either quite black, or spotted with white and brown, or with a\r\nwhitish forehead and several white patches on the back and hind-limbs. _D.\r\ntypographus_ of Central America is vermilion red, with small dark marks on\r\nthe back; the legs are black.\r\n\r\nThe various species of _Dendrobates_ take remarkable care of their young.\r\n_D. braccatus_ lives in Brazil in \"varzeas,\" _i.e._ moist but waterless\r\nplaces, and carries its tadpoles on its back, to which they are attached by\r\na peculiar secretion. The same is said to be true of _D. trivittatus_,\r\nwhich sits down in a drying-up puddle, lets the little tadpoles, when they\r\nare only 6-7 mm. long, fasten themselves on, and conveys them to a safer\r\nlocality, where the water is calculated not to evaporate before the\r\nmetamorphosis is completed.\r\n\r\n{274}_Mantella._–Both omo- and meta-sternum possess a bony style. The\r\ntongue is free and distinctly mitred or cut out behind. The skin is very\r\ngranular. Several species, in Madagascar, were formerly put into the same\r\ngenus as the American forms, until Boulenger established the genus\r\n_Mantella_ for them. The coloration is strikingly pretty. _M.\r\nmadagascariensis_ is a rare instance of difference in colour between the\r\ntwo sexes. The male is bluish black, with light blue spots on the belly,\r\nwhile the thighs and the inner sides of the legs are beautifully red. The\r\nfemale is deep black, with a light green spot at the base and in front of\r\nthe limbs; the rest is coloured like the male.\r\n\r\n_Cardioglossa gracilis_, quite recently discovered at the Gaboon, has\r\nlikewise to be added to the Dendrobatinae, on account of the absence of\r\nteeth. It is a small, slender, arboreal frog, bearing an unmistakable\r\nresemblance to the other genera by its general appearance and conspicuous,\r\ncontrasting coloration of black and white.\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nREPTILIA\r\n\r\n \"Cada uno es como Dios le hizo,\r\n  y aun peor muchas vezes.\"\r\n\r\n \"We are all as God made us\r\n  and many even worse.\"\r\n\r\n           SANCHO PANZA,\r\n           _Don Quixote_.\r\n\r\n{277}CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nREPTILIA\r\n\r\nDEFINITION AND CHARACTERS–POSITION OF THE CLASS REPTILIA IN THE PHYLUM\r\nVERTEBRATA–CLASSIFICATION–SKULL AND VERTEBRAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent Reptiles comprise, broadly speaking, the Crocodiles, Tortoises,\r\nLizards, and Snakes. They are the only Vertebrates which are cold-blooded,\r\nbreathe by lungs, and have a median occipital condyle. Another equally\r\nsufficient diagnosis is the following:–Tetrapoda, with a median occipital\r\ncondyle, with nucleated red blood-corpuscles, and with complete right and\r\nleft functional aortic arches. A still shorter diagnosis is:–Monocondylia\r\nwith a scaly skin.\r\n\r\nIf our diagnosis is to include the fossil Reptiles we have not only to\r\ndiscard the characters drawn from the soft parts as unavailable, but we are\r\nforced to treat the condition of the occipital condyle with caution, since\r\nthere exist, or must have existed, transitional stages between Reptiles and\r\nAmphibia and Mammals; and the winged class Pterosauria does not permit us\r\nto use the wings as a differential character for the Birds. In fact, while\r\nthe Reptilia are sufficiently separated from the Amphibia by their\r\nabsolutely gastrocentrous vertebrae, it is difficult to distinguish them as\r\na class from the Birds; hence the term SAUROPSIDA, which is intended to\r\nindicate the close relationship of the Reptiles to the Birds in opposition\r\nto the Mammalia, and to the ICHTHYOPSIDA or Amphibia and Fishes. However,\r\nthe Reptilia take up a very central position in the evolution of the main\r\nclasses of the Vertebrata. On the one hand, there is not the slightest\r\ndoubt that they are evolved from some branch of {278}the Stegocephali,\r\nwhilst on the other hand the Reptiles, probably through some branch of the\r\nTheromorpha, have given rise to the Mammals; some other Reptilian branch,\r\nat present unknown, has blossomed out into the Birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPAL CHARACTERS OF THE REPTILIA.\r\n\r\n  1. The vertebrae are gastrocentrous.\r\n\r\n  2. The skull articulates with the atlas by one condyle, which is formed\r\n  mainly by the basioccipital.\r\n\r\n  3. The mandible consists of many pieces and articulates with the cranium\r\n  through the quadrate bones.\r\n\r\n  4. There is an auditory columellar apparatus fitting into the fenestra\r\n  ovalis.\r\n\r\n  5. The limbs are of the tetrapodous, pentadactyle type.\r\n\r\n  6. There is an intracranial hypoglossal nerve.\r\n\r\n  7. The ribs form a true sternum.\r\n\r\n  8. The ilio-sacral connexion is post-acetabular.\r\n\r\n  9. The skin is covered (_a_) with scales, but (_b_) neither with feathers\r\n  nor with hairs; and there is a great paucity of glands.\r\n\r\n  10. Reptiles are poikilothermous.\r\n\r\n  11. The red blood-corpuscles are nucleated, biconvex, and oval.\r\n\r\n  12. The heart is divided into two atria and an imperfectly divided\r\n  ventricle. It has no conus, but semilunar valves exist at the base of the\r\n  tripartite aortic trunk.\r\n\r\n  13. The right and left aortic arch are complete and remain functional.\r\n\r\n  14. Respiration is effected by lungs; and gills are entirely absent, even\r\n  during embryonic life.\r\n\r\n  15. Lateral sense-organs are absent.\r\n\r\n  16. The kidneys have no nephrostomes. Each kidney has one separate\r\n  ureter.\r\n\r\n  17. There is always a typical cloaca.\r\n\r\n  18. The eggs are meroblastic.\r\n\r\n  19. Fertilisation is internal, and is effected, with the single exception\r\n  of _Sphenodon_, by means of male copulatory organs.\r\n\r\n  20. An amnion and an allantois are formed during development.\r\n\r\n    Numbers 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 14, 16, 18, 20 separate the Reptiles from the\r\n    Amphibia. Cf. also pp. 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n    Numbers 9 (_b_), 10, 12, and 13 separate them from the Birds and\r\n    Mammals.\r\n\r\n    Numbers 3, 8, and 11 separate them from the Mammals.\r\n\r\nThe EVOLUTION OF THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE REPTILES has to a certain extent\r\nbeen already treated on pp. 7-9. For a long time only Chelonia or\r\nTortoises, Ophidia or Snakes, and Saurii were recognised as their principal\r\ndivisions. Then the Crocodiles were separated from the Lizards; later the\r\nCoeciliae were removed from the Snakes and referred to the Amphibia,\r\n{279}and ultimately _Sphenodon_ was recognised as deserving a separate\r\nposition, equal in rank to the other groups. Stannius showed that the\r\nCrocodiles and Tortoises are relatively near allies in opposition to the\r\nlikewise closely allied Lizards and Snakes (_Sphenodon_ was then unknown),\r\nand he expressed this by the term Monimostylica, or creatures with fixed\r\nquadrate bones, for the former, and Streptostylica, creatures with movable\r\nquadrates, for the latter combination. The fossil Reptiles were hardly\r\nallowed proper places in the system. In various zoological text-books they\r\nwere, or are even now, treated as inconvenient, outlying, or supernumerary\r\nmembers. A long time elapsed before, thanks to the labours of H. von Meyer,\r\nOwen, Huxley, Marsh, Cope, Zittel, and Seeley, it was recognised that the\r\nextinct groups form the preponderant mass of Reptiles, and that it is the\r\nrecent groups which, in spite of the bewildering number of species of\r\nLizards and Snakes, are the comparatively few and much-reduced members of a\r\nonce flourishing class. With the exception of the Lizards and Snakes, which\r\nare on the ascending branch, the modern _Sphenodon_, the Crocodiles and the\r\nTortoises are a mere fraction, comprising a few survivals of\r\nrichly-developed groups, while all the others, the overwhelming majority,\r\nhave died out.\r\n\r\nThe classification adopted in this volume is as follows:–\r\n\r\n  CLASS REPTILIA.\r\n\r\n    Sub-Class    I.

We cannot yet construct a satisfactory phyletic tree of the\r\nReptiles. The Proreptilia connect them with the Amphibia. Next follow the\r\nProsauria with _Sphenodon_ among the Prosauri as the key to most other\r\ngroups. Then follow the Theromorpha, and it is probable that from various\r\nbranches of these have arisen the Chelonia, Dinosauria, Crocodilia, and\r\nPlesiosauria. The descent of the Ichthyosauria is very problematic. The\r\nsame applies to the Pterosauria and to the Pythonomorpha, but it is\r\npossible that they, together with the Sauria, are connected with the\r\nProsauria.\r\n\r\nWith all reserve these hypothetical affinities may be expressed by the\r\nfollowing diagram:–\r\n\r\n                                          Lacertilia  Ophidia\r\n                                                 |   /\r\n  Ichthyosauria     Plesiosauria                 |  /\r\n              \\               \\                  | /\r\n               \\               \\ Crocodilia      |/\r\n                ?               \\  |           Sauria\r\n                                 \\ |             |\r\n                Chelonia          \\|             |    Pterosauria\r\n                        \\ Dinosauria  Sphenodon  |   /\r\n                         \\    |          |       |  /\r\n                          \\   |          |       | /  Pythonomorpha\r\n                           \\  |          |       |/      |\r\n                            Theromorpha  |–––––––––––––––\r\n                                  |      |\r\n                                 Prosauria\r\n                                     |\r\n                                Proreptilia\r\n\r\nThe eleven sub-classes of the Reptilia present so many important\r\ndifferences that it is not advisable to give here a further general account\r\nof their structure. The diagrammatic figures A to T on pp. 280, 281,\r\nrepresenting various types of skulls, are intended to explain their chief\r\nmodifications, all referable to Proreptilian and to certain Theromorphous\r\nconditions. One of the most important features is that the mandible, which\r\nis always composed of many pieces (cf. Fig. 142, p. 550), is invariably\r\ncarried by the quadrate bone. Diagrams of the generalised skulls of a Bird\r\nand a Mammal have been added for comparison.\r\n\r\n{283}[Illustration: FIG. 56.–Composition of vertebrae of Reptiles,\r\nillustrated by the first and second cervical vertebrae.

At the\r\nearlier stages of development the gastrocentrous vertebrae behave in the\r\n{284}same way as that described on p. 12 (Fig. 1), except that the\r\ninterdorsal elements are suppressed from the beginning. If the remaining\r\nthree pairs of constituent elements of each vertebra (the basidorsalia,\r\nforming the neural arch; the interventralia, forming the body or centrum;\r\nand the basiventralia) remain separate, the vertebrae are called\r\n_temnospondylous_ (τέμνω, I cut, σπόνδυλος, a vertebra). If the neural\r\narches and the centra are suturally united or are fused with each other,\r\nthe vertebrae are called _stereospondylous_ (στερεός, solid). In many\r\nAmniota the atlas or first vertebra remains in a relatively primitive,\r\nembryonic condition, and is temnospondylous but for the usual modification\r\nthat its centrum becomes attached to that of the second vertebra, and forms\r\nthe odontoid process of the latter. The composition of gastrocentrous\r\nvertebrae (cf. p. 282) is best illustrated by the first and second cervical\r\nvertebrae of the Crocodile (Fig. 56, 3, p. 283).\r\n\r\nConcerning GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION, even a cursory study shows that the\r\nsub-classes have come into existence at very different geological periods,\r\nand have each followed their own lines of dispersal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{285}CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPROREPTILIA–PROSAURIA–THEROMORPHA\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS I.–PROREPTILIA._\r\n\r\n_Permian Temnospondylous Reptiles with well-developed limbs and girdles of\r\nthe terrestrial type._\r\n\r\nThe two genera _Eryops_ and _Cricotus_ of the North-American Permian\r\nformation had until recently[120] been relegated to the Stegocephali. By\r\ngrouping them and their nearest allies together as Proreptilia it is\r\nintended to indicate that they are the lowest known Reptiles and that they\r\nprobably link this class to the Amphibia. The superficial resemblance of\r\ntheir tri- or bi-partite vertebrae, and their occurrence in the Lower\r\nPermian, have caused the error of classing them with the Stegocephali, but\r\nthe composition of their typically gastrocentrous vertebrae leaves no doubt\r\nas to their affinities. After all, we feel certain that Reptiles have\r\narisen from Stegocephalous Amphibia, and it is in the Lower Permian,\r\nexactly where these debatable creatures lived side by side with\r\nStegocephali, undoubtedly likewise temnospondylous, that the change from\r\nAmphibia into Reptiles seems to have taken place. Both are referable to\r\nAmphibia with quadripartite vertebrae. The condition of the occipital\r\ncondyles determines nothing. This greatly exaggerated character has lost in\r\nimportance since we have known the condylar modifications of the\r\nTheromorpha; moreover, _Cricotus_ itself seems to have possessed a single\r\ncondyle. We should even expect the Proreptilia to present many\r\nStegocephalous inheritances, for instance the condition of the skull roofed\r\nin by dermal bones, a ventral dermal armour, a very complete pectoral arch\r\nstill without a sternum, and only one sacral vertebra.\r\n\r\n{286}Until more genera are better known than they are now, it is premature\r\nto divide the present sub-class into orders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.–Trunk vertebrae of _Eryops_ (cf. Fig. 56, 4,\r\np. 283). _Cp_, Articular facet of the capitulum of a rib.]\r\n\r\n_Eryops_, with several species in Texas and New Mexico. _E. megacephalus_\r\nis the most abundant and the largest species, its broad and flattened skull\r\nmeasuring more than 18 inches in length and 12 in width. With the exception\r\nof the nostrils and the small orbits, the skull is entirely encased in\r\nbone, with a rough, pitted surface, but without any distinguishable\r\nsutures. The absence of mucous canals, so common in the Stegocephali, is\r\nworthy of note. The quadrates extend obliquely outwards and backwards, so\r\nthat the joint with the mandible lies in a plane behind the occiput. The\r\nmandibles are devoid of a projecting angular process. The teeth are\r\nnumerous, small, and pointed. The vertebrae are typically temnospondylous,\r\nconsisting each of three pairs of separately ossified pieces, which,\r\nalthough closely packed together, are not suturally connected. The neural\r\narches possess high spinous processes, they articulate by short and broad\r\nzygapophyses and are, with their triangular bases, wedged in between the\r\ntwo ventral pieces, the posterior of which (the united interventralia) is\r\nin broader contact with the neural arch and lies behind it; the anterior\r\npiece (the united basiventrals) appear as typical, but large, intercentra,\r\nand bear on their posterior, dorsal margin the facets for the ribs. The\r\nlatter are short, but are broad at their proximal ends, which are not\r\nbifurcated; they extend their articulation from the \"intercentra\" upon the\r\nshort lateral processes of the neural arches. The tail is short and ends in\r\na pointed coccyx, owing to fusion of the last vertebrae.\r\n\r\nThe pubes and ischia are heavy, the former flattened and broadened out. The\r\nlimbs are of an almost ideal pentadactyloid type; strongly developed for\r\nterrestrial locomotion. The ulna possesses a large olecranon. The carpus\r\nconsists of ten separate pieces, ulnare, intermedium, radiale, two\r\ncentralia and five distal carpalia. The latter support only four\r\nmetacarpals and fingers, the second finger being completely abolished, an\r\nexplanation suggested by Cope and corroborated by Emery.[121]\r\n\r\n{287}_Cricotus_, with several species in Texas and Illinois. _C.\r\nheteroclitus_ was perhaps 10 feet long and probably aquatic. The skull has\r\na long, narrow, depressed snout, the margins overhanging those of the lower\r\njaw; its surface is encased in dermal bones, most of which still show\r\nsutures, so that for instance postfrontals, postorbitals, supratemporals\r\nand squamosals can be distinguished; all these are in contact with the long\r\nparietals and with the quadrato-jugal arch, covering the temporal region;\r\nbut the supratemporals have a free projecting border, like the squamosals\r\nof the crocodiles. According to Cope's description the basioccipital is\r\nconnected with the first vertebra by an undivided discoid \"intercentrum,\"\r\nprobably the true centrum, while the first basiventral mass, which would\r\nbe, if independent, the first true intercentrum, is more probably connected\r\nwith the first neural arch, thus constituting the ring of the atlas.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are still temnospondylous, but no longer tripartite. The\r\nneural arch is fused with the interventralia into one mass, which carries\r\nthe capitula and tubercula of the ribs, while the united basiventrals still\r\nremain as separate intercentral wedges. In the tail these wedges carry\r\nchevron-bones, and are enlarged into thick almost complete discs, or rather\r\nrings, while the whole vertebral column is still perforated, as also in\r\n_Eryops_, by the chorda dorsalis. The tail is long. The digits are devoid\r\nof claws.\r\n\r\nRemains of dermal armour exist on the throat in the shape of several large\r\ngular plates, while the whole belly is covered with many closely packed\r\nbony scales, which are arranged in chevron-shaped transverse rows.\r\n\r\nProbably several other genera of American Permian and also of European\r\nPermian strata will, when better known and critically examined, have to be\r\nreferred to the Proreptilia. Thus for instance the European _Melosaurus_\r\nmay have affinities with _Eryops_, while _Diplovertebron_ of Bohemia seems\r\nto be allied to _Cricotus_. The difficulty of division will lie with those\r\nLower Permian Amphibia which, like _Archegosaurus_, _Euchirosaurus_,\r\n_Actinodon_, possess tripartite vertebrae, which at first sight are\r\nstrikingly like those of _Eryops_. But the tail-vertebrae permit of no\r\nmistake, and since these are quadripartite in _Archegosaurus_,\r\n_Chelydosaurus_, and _Sphenosaurus_, these genera are safely to be classed\r\nwith the Amphibia, unless, indeed, for mere argument's {288}sake, it be\r\nassumed that the intercentral discs of _Diplovertebron_ and _Cricotus_ are\r\nformed by the fusion of Amphibian interdorsals with interventrals. Anyhow,\r\nsimply to state that the tripartite vertebrae of _Eryops_ are the same as\r\nthose of _Actinodon_, would be as convincing as saying that the English and\r\nFrench flags are essentially the same, both containing the same colours,\r\nbut one is white, red, and blue, the other blue, white, and red. Tripartite\r\nAmphibian vertebrae are composed of basidorsals + basiventrals +\r\ninterdorsals, those of Reptiles are made up of basidorsals + basiventrals +\r\ninterventrals. (Cf. Fig. 56, p. 283, and Fig. 1, p. 13.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS II.–PROSAURIA._\r\n\r\n_Mostly extinct Reptiles, with deeply amphicoelous but stereospondylous\r\nvertebrae, with movable chevron-bones in the tail and frequently with\r\nintercentra in the trunk._ Sphenodon, _the only recent genus, has no\r\ncopulatory organs_.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. MICROSAURI.\r\n\r\n_Extinct, small Reptiles, mostly Carboniferous and Permian, with dermal\r\narmour on the dorsal and ventral side and with bifurcated ribs._\r\n\r\nWe retain this term of Dawson's for those small, newt-shaped, chiefly\r\nPermian reptiles, which are allied to _Hylonomus_, after elimination of\r\ncontemporary forms like _Keraterpeton_ and _Urocordylus_, which belong to\r\nthe Branchiosaurian order of the Stegocephali. Until recently[122] all\r\nthese creatures had been classed with the Stegocephali. The Microsauri in\r\nthe present restricted sense reveal themselves, however, as reptiles by the\r\nmovable chevron-bones in their tail, their broad neurocentral sutures, the\r\npossession of two sacral vertebrae (_Petrobates_), the bifurcated ribs\r\nwhich always articulate with the centra (most clearly shown in\r\n_Orthocosta_), and the possession of five fingers and toes.\r\n\r\nConsidering the age of these little creatures and their low position in the\r\nreptilian scale–in fact, they stand almost as low {289}as the\r\nProreptilia–it is not to be wondered at that they still retain a number of\r\namphibian features. The skull is encased in dermal bones as in the\r\nStegocephali, and the dermal armour of the trunk and tail is composed of\r\nmany bony, sculptured scales, which cover back, sides, and under surface.\r\nThe middle rows on the back are the largest, while the scales on the belly\r\nare arranged in transverse rows, which imbricate and converge obliquely\r\nheadwards. Special gular plates seem to be absent. The skull has an\r\ninterparietal foramen. The jaws and the palate are furnished with small,\r\nsimple teeth, and there is a large parasphenoid bone, an eminently\r\namphibian character. The occipital condylar articulation is supposed to be\r\ndouble. The centra of the vertebrae are deeply amphicoelous, elongated, and\r\nconstricted in the middle, just like those of the Aistopoda and\r\nBranchiosauri. The dorsal spinous processes are strongly developed, and\r\nwith the zygapophyses are very reptilian. Transverse processes are absent\r\nor very short, the tubercular portions of the ribs articulating with the\r\ncentra, the capitula mostly intervertebrally, in any case close to the\r\nanterior end of the centra. The tail-vertebrae possess very typical,\r\nmovable chevrons, placed intervertebrally, and bear an extraordinary\r\nresemblance to those of Geckos. The ribs are long and slender, but there is\r\nno sternum. The fore- and hind-limbs are pentadactyle, in opposition to the\r\ninvariably four-fingered Stegocephali. The shoulder-girdle consists of\r\nscapulae, coracoids, clavicles, cleithra, and a T-shaped interclavicle. The\r\npelvis also resembles that of certain Stegocephali by the separately\r\nossified, somewhat disc-shaped, flat ischia and pubes, which seem to have\r\nbeen joined together by cartilage into one broad mass.\r\n\r\n_Hylonomus_, Dawson's type of Microsauri, was found in the Coal-measures of\r\nNova Scotia, within decayed tree-stumps. Closely allied, if not identical,\r\nbut much better known is _Hyloplesion_, e.g. _H. longicostatum_ of the\r\nuppermost Permian of Nyrschan in Bohemia. Total length under 4 inches; eyes\r\nwith bony sclerotic rings; neck short. The truly Permian genera _Dawsonia_,\r\n_Melanerpeton_, _Orthocosta_, and _Seeleya_ are allied forms, the last\r\nscarcely one inch in length, but well preserved. _Petrobates_ of the\r\nTriassic Lower Red Sandstone of Saxony has an arrangement of the ventral\r\ndermal armour closely resembling abdominal ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n{290}ORDER II. PROSAURI\r\n\r\nMostly extinct, chiefly Permian and Triassic, terrestrial, unarmoured\r\nreptiles with deeply biconcave vertebrae, numerous intercentra and\r\nchevron-bones, fixed quadrates, complete pentadactyle limbs and\r\nshoulder-girdle, entepicondylar foramina, acrodont teeth, and many small\r\nabdominal ossifications.\r\n\r\nThe Prosauri differ from the Microsauri, with which they are closely\r\nallied, by the more advanced solidification of the vertebrae, the reduction\r\nof the tubercular portions of the ribs, the presence of an entepicondylar\r\nforamen in the humerus, and the loss of the dermal ossifications on the\r\nupper surface.\r\n\r\nTheir ancestors are the Microsauri, whilst they themselves seem to be very\r\nnear the root whence have sprung most, if not all, other main branches of\r\nthe reptiles, notably Crocodilia, Dinosauria, and Sauria. In fact the\r\nProsauri, although apparently few in number, seem to represent the central\r\nstem of the reptilian tree. Only one of them is still surviving, the famous\r\n_Sphenodon_, now represented by a single species in New Zealand.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 1. PROTOROSAURI.–The ventral half of the pelvis seems to have\r\nformed one broad, continuous mass of cartilage in which the pubic bones are\r\nrepresented by a pair of oval, rather disc-shaped ossifications, while the\r\nischia are more elongated. The pelvis consequently still bears a great\r\nresemblance to that of the Microsauri, and thereby also to the\r\nStegocephalous condition, but the ilium seems to be attached to more than\r\ntwo vertebrae. The vertebrae are deeply biconcave, perhaps even with a\r\npersistent continuous chorda. The neural arches bear high, laterally\r\ncompressed spines, but no diapophysial or lateral processes, the ribs being\r\nplaced mostly intervertebrally and having lost their tubercular portions.\r\nThe ribs are continued to about the sixth caudal vertebra. Intercentral\r\nwedges exist in an unbroken series between all the vertebrae from the atlas\r\nto the tail, where they are represented by movable chevrons. A costal\r\nsternum seems to be absent, unless it was quite cartilaginous. The\r\nshoulder-girdle is complete, consisting of a long interclavicle, clavicles,\r\ndisc-shaped coracoids, and scapulae; but there are no cleithra, and no\r\nindication of precoracoids or even notches in the coracoids. The fore- and\r\nhind-limbs are complete and primitive, with five digits. The abdomen is\r\nprotected by numerous oat-shaped little {291}ossifications, which are\r\narranged in many transverse or rather chevron-shaped rows, still greatly\r\nresembling the condition prevailing in the Microsauri, except that they\r\nhave sunk deeper into the skin, being no longer directly covered by the\r\nscales. The skull, being no longer completely encased by bones, and\r\npossessing now wide supra- and infra-temporal fossae, appears at first\r\nsight much like that of a generalised lizard, except that it possesses\r\nthree very conspicuous and distinct arcades in the temporal region: namely,\r\nthe orbito-squamosal bridge across the temporal fossa, formed by the\r\npostorbital and squamosal; the arch formed by the squamosal with the\r\npostero-lateral buttress of the parietal; and the infratemporal arch or\r\njugal bridge. The jugal itself is long, connecting the quadrato-jugal with\r\nthe maxillary and lacrymal, and sending up an ascending process to the\r\npostorbital bone, thus taking a considerable share in the formation of the\r\norbit. The quadrato-jugal is small, apparently fused with the quadrate,\r\nwhich itself is firmly overlaid by the squamosal. The quadrates are further\r\nfixed by being buttressed by the pterygoids, which rest upon short\r\nbasisphenoid processes and extend far forwards, meeting the vomers and\r\nseparating the palatines. The premaxillae are short, the nares small and\r\nterminal, the nasal bones are large. There is a small interparietal\r\nforamen. The teeth are acrodont and pointed, forming unbroken series on the\r\npremaxillaries, maxillaries, palatines and dentaries, and there are\r\nscattered little teeth on the vomers.\r\n\r\n_Palaeohatteria longicaudata_ from the Lower Red Sandstone of Saxony. Total\r\nlength about 18 inches, with six cervical, twenty trunk, three or four\r\nsacral, and about fifty caudal vertebrae. The teeth are ankylosed with the\r\nsupporting bones. The five fingers have 2, 3, 4, 5, 3 phalanges\r\nrespectively. For the skull see Fig. 54, G, p. 280. _Telerpeton elginense_\r\nfrom the Triassic sandstone of Scotland, and perhaps _Saurosternon_ of the\r\nSouth African Karroo sandstone seem to be allied.\r\n\r\n_Protorosaurus_ (πρῶτος = first, ὤρα = spring, or dawn, not\r\n_Proterosaurus_) apparently several species, e.g. _P. lincki_ in the Upper\r\nPermian (marl-slate and magnesian limestone) of Thuringia and Durham. About\r\n4 or 5 feet long, and in its general appearance rather like a\r\nMonitor-lizard, with about eight cervical vertebrae, most of which carry\r\nslender backwardly-pointing ribs, sixteen long-ribbed trunk-vertebrae,\r\nfollowed by three or four {292}sacrals and more than thirty caudals, some\r\nof which have bifurcated spinous processes.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 2. RHYNCHOCEPHALI.–The ventral pelvic bones resemble those of\r\nlizards and enclose a wide pubo-ischiadic foramen. There are only two\r\nsacral vertebrae. The abdominal ribs are closely packed, each transverse\r\nset consisting of only three rod-shaped pieces instead of many small\r\noat-shaped nodules. The intercentra are sometimes suppressed in the\r\ntrunk-region.\r\n\r\n_Rhynchosaurus_ from the Upper Trias of Warwickshire and Shropshire, and\r\n_Hyperodapedon_ of the same age, found at Elgin, in Warwickshire, and also\r\nin Central India, are rather large, _H. gordoni_ measuring 6 feet in\r\nlength. Both have a short, broad, and stout cranium, and curved down,\r\ntoothless premaxillae, hence the name Rhynchocephali; the nares are\r\nconfluent; the teeth are numerous and small, and are liable to be worn down\r\nso that the animals ultimately bite with the edges of the jaws, to which\r\nthe teeth are ankylosed. The premaxillaries of _Rhynchosaurus_ are curved\r\ndownwards over a slightly upcurved, likewise toothless process of the\r\nmandibles, which form a strong symphysis. All the teeth are very small,\r\nabsent, or minute on the mandibles, forming one series on the maxillae,\r\nseveral rows on the vomers and especially on the palatines, which latter\r\nremain separated from each other. _Hyperodapedon_ seems to have lost the\r\nintercentra; its vertebrae are solid, those of the neck are opisthocoelous.\r\nThe interparietal foramen is likewise abolished. The hook-shaped end of the\r\ncurved-down premaxillae fits into a bifurcation of the mandibles in front\r\nof their stout symphysis. The teeth are similar to those of the other\r\ngenus. Whilst these, the earliest known genera of Rhynchocephali, are\r\nalready in various ways rather specialised, _e.g._ the hooked beak and the\r\nloss of the intercentra, the two following fossil genera, although of much\r\nlater date, namely Upper Triassic, are more closely allied to the recent\r\n_Sphenodon_.\r\n\r\n_Homoeosaurus pulchellus_ and other species in Germany are only 6 to 8\r\ninches long. The vertebral column consists of twenty-three presacral and\r\nmany caudal vertebrae. The first five cervicals are devoid of ribs.\r\nIntercentra are restricted to the neck and the anterior portion of the\r\ntail. The mandibles are not fused together. The nares are divided by a bony\r\nseptum. Each premaxillary has one rather broad tooth.\r\n\r\n{293}[Illustration: FIG. 58.–_Sphenodon punctatum._ × ⅓.]\r\n\r\n{294}The teeth of the maxillaries and mandibles are triangular, much worn\r\ndown in front. The ribs are devoid of uncinate processes. Closely allied\r\nbut larger is _Sauranodon_ of France, which has lost the upper teeth and\r\nuses the sharp margins of the jaws instead.\r\n\r\n_Pleurosaurus_ of Germany and France, about 5 feet in length, is remarkable\r\nfor the shortness of its still pentadactyle extremities, for its short\r\nneck, and very long tail;–an interesting parallel to what has happened in\r\nmany genera of recent lizards.\r\n\r\n_Sphenodon_ s. _Hatteria_ is the sole surviving member of the whole group\r\nof Prosauria, and is represented by one species only, _S. punctatum_, in\r\nNew Zealand. As the last living witness of bygone ages this primitive,\r\nalmost ideally generalised type of reptiles, this \"living fossil,\" deserves\r\na detailed description.\r\n\r\nTotal length of very large male specimens up to two feet and a half; in\r\ngeneral appearance like many a stoutly built lizard. The general colour of\r\nthe skin is dark olive-green with small white or yellowish specks on the\r\nsides. A series of slightly erectile spines of yellowish colour extends\r\nfrom the top of the head to the end of the tail, but is interrupted on the\r\nneck; they are cutaneous, covered with a thin sheath of horn. The under\r\nsurface is covered with numerous scales, arranged in transverse rows; the\r\nrest of the body is rather granular. The tail is thick, slightly compressed\r\nlaterally. The eye is large, dark brown, with a vertical pupil.\r\n\r\nThose who are satisfied with superficial resemblances still group this\r\ncreature with the lizards, but it reveals itself as a primitive reptile or\r\nProsaurian by the following characters, every one of which distinguishes it\r\nfrom the lizards:–The temporal region is bridged by three bony arcades. The\r\nlarge vomers, palatines, and pterygoids form a broad bony roof to the\r\nmouth; the large quadrates are firmly fixed by the pterygoids, squamosals,\r\nlateral occipital bones, and by the jugal bridge. The vertebrae possess an\r\nunbroken series of intercentral wedge-bones. There is an elaborate system\r\nof abdominal ribs. The humerus has an entepicondylar foramen, and there is\r\nalso, in contradistinction to the fossil Rhynchocephalia, an ectepicondylar\r\nforamen for the passage of the radial nerve. The carpus still has the\r\nprimitive number of ten bones, all of which remain separate, including the\r\nintermedium. Of soft parts are to be mentioned above all the entire absence\r\nof external copulatory organs, _Sphenodon_ being the {295}only recent\r\nreptile which is devoid of them; a most primitive condition, sufficient by\r\nitself to separate this creature from all the other living reptiles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.–A, Dorsal; B, ventral; C, left-sided view of the\r\nskull of _Sphenodon_. × 3/2. _Col_, columella auris; _Cond_, occipital\r\ncondyle; _E.P_, ectopterygoid; _F_, frontal; _Jug_, jugal; _Max_,\r\nmaxillary; _Na_, nasal; _No_, anterior nasal opening; _Pal_, palatine;\r\n_Par_, parietal; _Pmx_, premaxillary; _Prf_, prefrontal; _Pt.f_,\r\npostfrontal and postorbital; _Ptg_, pterygoid or endopterygoid; _Q_,\r\nquadrate and quadrato-jugal; _Sq_, squamosal; _Vo_, vomer. See also Fig.\r\n54, B, p. 280.]\r\n\r\nThe supratemporal bridge is formed by the squamosal and postorbital (Fig.\r\n59, C, _Pt.f_), the latter being continued forwards and fused with the\r\npostfrontal (A, _Pt.f_). The postorbital joins the ascending branch of the\r\njugal, both together forming the hinder border of the orbit; this is\r\nbordered below chiefly by {296}the maxillary, which is long, while the\r\nanterior process of the jugal is much reduced. There is no pre-orbital\r\nfossa. The nares are terminal and lateral, well separated by the\r\npremaxillaries. The posterior temporal bridge is formed by the squamosal\r\nand parietal, the bridge extending laterally over the quadrate and\r\nenclosing a wide space between itself and the buttress-like expansion of\r\nthe lateral occipital bone. The space enclosed between this occipital\r\nbuttress, the quadrate, and the pterygoid support of the latter is likewise\r\nvery large; it is of course the cavity of the middle ear, and as such is\r\ncrossed by the columellar chain of the ear. The infratemporal bridge or\r\njugal arch is formed by the jugal, which joins the descending process of\r\nthe squamosal, and by the quadrato-jugal, which is small and fused with the\r\nquadrate. The latter is consequently very firmly fixed.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are acrodont, ankylosed in one series with the supporting bones,\r\ntriangular and much worn down in older specimens. Originally there seem to\r\nbe several in the premaxilla, but the adult bite with the somewhat\r\ncurved-down portions of the premaxillaries themselves, or with what remains\r\nof the fused bases of the original teeth, which then, together with the\r\nbone, look like one pair of large chisel-shaped incisors. The lateral edges\r\nof the palatines likewise carry teeth, those of the mandibles fit into the\r\nlong slit-like space between the palatine and the maxillary teeth. Young\r\nspecimens have a few small teeth on the vomers, which are large, and\r\nseparate the long choanae from each other. The pterygoids form an anterior\r\nsymphysis, posteriorly they rest upon short processes of the basisphenoid\r\nand send short flanges to the quadrates.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral column is very primitive. The atlas is still typically\r\ntemnospondylous. The first intercentrum or fused pair of basiventrals is\r\nbroad and thick, and forms the ventral half of the atlas-ring, which\r\narticulates with the first centrum and with the second intercentrum. The\r\nirregularly shaped neural arches remain separate from each other and from\r\nthe centrum; they carry on the dorsal side a pair of disconnected\r\nsupradorsals, the so-called pro-atlas. The second intercentrum is fused\r\nwith the first and second centrum. The second to ninth intercentra have low\r\nmedian ridges or knobs, and are as a rule more firmly attached to the\r\ncranial ends of the centra. Those of the trunk are small. From the third or\r\nfourth caudal vertebra {297}backwards they appear as chevrons, articulating\r\nmore with the vertebra in front than with the one behind. The bases of the\r\nright and left chevrons are frequently fused across so that the caudal\r\ncanal is completely surrounded by bone, a feature common in Dinosaurs.\r\nEvery intercentrum, be it a pair of chevrons, or an unpaired nodule, or\r\ncrescent, extends dorsalwards into a fibro-cartilaginous ring which\r\nsurrounds the chorda. The centra of the vertebrae are deeply amphicoelous,\r\nthe cavity being filled throughout life by the chorda; but the middle of\r\nthe centra is solid. Most of the caudal vertebrae are transversely divided\r\ninto two parts, the posterior of which carries the greater share of the\r\narches; they resemble in this respect those of lizards, and the lost tail\r\nis likewise reproduced. The first three ribs are represented by bands of\r\nconnective tissue. The first is attached to the side of the first\r\nintercentrum; the second arises from the second intercentrum, and forms a\r\nsmall tubercle on the side of the second centrum; the third behaves\r\nsimilarly. The vertebral arteries and lateral strands of the sympathetic\r\nnerve-chain pass through these double basal attachments of the reduced\r\nribs. The other ribs are osseous; they possess short capitula which retain\r\ntheir partly intercentral attachment, while the short tubercula are carried\r\nby low processes of the centra, not of the neural arches. Already in the\r\nthoracic region both capitulum and tuberculum merge into one facet, at\r\nfirst dumb-bell shaped, further towards the tail oval, gradually shifted\r\nbackwards and dorsalwards upon the middle of the centrum, until the facet\r\nreaches and ultimately lies right across the neuro-central suture. The\r\nfirst few caudal vertebrae also possess ribs, which are however very short\r\nand fuse with the diapophyses, immediately below which lies the\r\nneuro-central suture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.–The first three cervical vertebrae of _Sphenodon_.\r\n1, 2, 3, 4, Intercentra; _C_{1}-C_{3}_, centra; _N_{1}-N_{3}_ neural\r\narches.]\r\n\r\nThe whole column consists of twenty-five presacral, two sacral, and about\r\nthirty caudal vertebrae. Some of the thoracic ribs have cartilaginous\r\nuncinate processes. Three or four pairs of ribs join a typical sternum,\r\ninto the antero-lateral portion of which are let in the coracoids. The\r\nsternum is raised into a low median crest which fuses with the posterior\r\nbranch of the {298}T-shaped interclavicle, while the lateral branches of\r\nthe latter fuse with the clavicles. The coracoids are broad and entire,\r\nstill without fenestrae or notches indicative of precoracoids. The\r\nparasternum is very elaborate; it extends from the sternum to the pubic\r\nbones, and consists of about twenty-four transverse rows, each of which is\r\ncomposed of a median and two lateral splint-bones. They are irregularly\r\nshaped, partly with imbricating hooks, and are firmly attached to, in fact\r\nstill connected with, the deeper portions of the cutaneous scales of the\r\nbelly. The three pairs of pelvic bones are fused together at the\r\nacetabulum. Pubes and ischia each form one symphysis, and these are\r\nconnected with each other by partly ossified cartilage and ligaments, so\r\nthat the originally heart-shaped space is divided into a pair of ovals. The\r\nlateral processes of the pubes are thick, but very short. The ischia have\r\npostero-lateral processes. There is also a mostly cartilaginous, unpaired\r\nhypo-ischium.\r\n\r\nThe fore- and hind-limbs are still primitive in structure; both\r\npentadactyle. The carpus consists of ten, sometimes eleven pieces,\r\naccording to the single or double nature of the central element. The\r\nproximal series is formed by the radiale, intermedian, and ulnare, with a\r\npisiform. The ulna and radius remain separate. The humerus has the usual\r\nectepicondylar in addition to the entepicondylar foramen common to all the\r\nProsauri and Theromorpha. The hind-limbs are typically plantigrade.\r\n\r\nThe tail is capable of regeneration, as in many lizards.\r\n\r\nThe development of this reptile has recently been studied and described by\r\nHowes,[123] who quotes the literature bearing upon the whole subject.\r\n\r\nA good account of the occurrence and habits of the \"Tuatera\" has been given\r\nby Newman.[124] The Maoris call it \"ruatara,\" \"tuatete,\" or \"tuatara,\" the\r\nlatter meaning \"having spines.\" Formerly common on the main islands of New\r\nZealand, they are now apparently restricted to some of the islets in the\r\nBay of Plenty, North Island. Bush-fires, wild pigs, dogs and cats,\r\nreptile-eating Maori tribes, and the advance of civilisation, have swept\r\nthem away except on some of the small uninhabited islands, difficult of\r\naccess, where they dig burrows, into which they retreat at the slightest\r\nsign of danger. They sleep during the {299}greater part of the day, are\r\nvery fond of lying in the water, and they can remain below for hours\r\nwithout breathing. They live strictly upon animals, but these are only\r\ntaken when alive and moving about. The kind of food seems to vary according\r\nto the custom or fancy of the individuals. Sir W. L. Buller observed that\r\nsome of his captives stubbornly refused to eat until one day, rather\r\naccidentally, minnows were offered. Others eat insects and worms; those\r\nwhich live near the seashore not improbably eat also crustaceans. From\r\nNovember to January they lay about ten eggs–white, hard-shelled, long and\r\noval–about 28 mm. long, in holes in the sand, where they can be warmed by\r\nthe sun. They are as a rule lazy in their movements. The usual pace is a\r\nslow crawl, the belly and tail trailing on the ground, but when chasing\r\nprey they lift the whole trunk off the ground. After running, or rather\r\n\"wobbling\" three or four yards, they grow weary and stop. They cannot jump\r\nthe smallest obstacle.\r\n\r\nVon Haast[125] has carefully examined their habitations on the Chicken\r\nIslands. The Tuatara excavates its own hole, and this is shared sociably by\r\nvarious kinds of Petrels. The entrance to the chamber is generally 4 or 5\r\ninches in diameter, and the passage leading into the inner chamber is 2 to\r\n3 feet long, first descending and then ascending again. The chamber itself\r\nis one foot and a half long, by one foot wide and 6 inches high, lined with\r\ngrass and leaves. The petrel lives usually on the left side, the Tuatara on\r\nthe right side of the inner chamber. Whilst very tolerant of the bird with\r\nits egg and young, it does not allow another of its own kind to live in the\r\nsame hole, which it is ready to defend by lying in such a manner that the\r\nhead is placed where the passage widens out into the chamber. On putting\r\none's hand or a stick into the burrow the Tuatara bites at them furiously.\r\nThey can run very fast, and defend themselves with great pluck against dog\r\nor man by biting or scratching. As soon as the sun has set they leave their\r\nholes to seek food. During the night, and especially during the pairing\r\nseason, they croak or grunt.\r\n\r\nThe eggs, having been deposited during the Southern summer, from November\r\nto January or February, in holes on a sunny and sandy spot, contain nearly\r\nripe embryos in the following August. They are, however, not hatched until\r\nabout thirteen {300}months old. In the meantime they seem to undergo a kind\r\nof aestivation. The nasal chambers become blocked with proliferating\r\nepithelium, which is resorbed shortly before hatching.\r\n\r\nI have kept half-a-dozen specimens in a green-house for several years, and\r\nhave come to the conclusion that they are dull, not companionable\r\ncreatures, in spite of their imposing, rather noble appearance when, with\r\ntheir heads erect, they calmly look about with their large, quiet eyes.\r\nEach dug its own hole in the hard ground underneath and between large\r\nstones. At dusk they sat in front of the holes or walked leisurely to the\r\npan with the earthworms which formed their principal food. Meat they did\r\nnot touch, but they killed and chewed up lizards and blind-worms. Sometimes\r\nthey soaked themselves for many hours in the shallow, warm water. The skin\r\nis shed in flakes. I never found them basking in the sun, and the pineal\r\neye, still so well developed in these strange creatures, caused them no\r\ndistress when bright light was thrown upon it. They grew tame enough not to\r\nrun away when found roaming about at night, but they did not like being\r\nhandled, and they inflicted the most painful bites when taken up\r\ncarelessly. The biggest, a male, was rather quarrelsome, grunted much, and\r\nworried the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS III.–THEROMORPHA._\r\n\r\nThe Theromorpha comprise a great number of extraordinary, extinct reptiles,\r\nwhich as a group had a wide range in space and time. The earliest known\r\noccur in the Lower Red Sandstone of Thuringia and Bohemia, and in the\r\nmiddle Permian strata of Russia. The majority have been found in strata\r\ntransitional between the Permian and the Triassic age, notably in the\r\nKarroo sandstone of South Africa and in corresponding levels of North\r\nAmerica. Closely allied to them are those of the Triassic sandstone of\r\nElgin in Scotland, and of India. They seem to have died out with the\r\nMuschelkalk or Middle Trias.\r\n\r\nThe various genera exhibit such a diversity of structure, shape, and size,\r\nand many are still so imperfectly known, that {301}any diagnosis is liable\r\nto be faulty, even assuming that they are a homogeneous group. To avoid\r\nconfusion, we characterise the Theromorpha as _Reptiles with a firmly fixed\r\nquadrate, a single temporal arch, an interparietal foramen, and a pelvis in\r\nwhich the pubes and ischia form one stout, ventral symphysis_.\r\n\r\nThe dentition is most abnormal, and permits the division of the Theromorpha\r\ninto two or three main groups. In the Pareiasauri the teeth of the upper\r\nand lower jaws form rather even series of nearly equal size; smaller teeth\r\nare carried by the palatal bones. In the Theriodontia the teeth are\r\ndifferentiated in a truly Mammalian fashion into incisors, prominent\r\ncanines, and multicuspid or tubercular molars. Each tooth, and this applies\r\nto all Theromorpha, is implanted in a separate alveolus; _Tritylodon_ only\r\nseems to have double-rooted molars. The lower canines cross in front of the\r\nupper, just as in Mammals. In _Placodus_, which probably belongs to this\r\nassembly, the teeth are few in numbers, very broad and flat, especially\r\nthose of the palate. In _Dicynodon_ and _Gordonia_ the teeth are restricted\r\nto a pair of conical, sometimes very large, tusk-like upper canines, and in\r\n_Oudenodon_ the whole mouth is toothless.\r\n\r\nThe configuration of the skull shows two main types. In the Pareiasauri it\r\nis completely roofed in by dermal bones, the only holes on the surface\r\nbeing the nostrils, orbits, and the interparietal foramen.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of the second type of skull is the tendency to\r\nform an almost Mammalian zygomatic arch by the junction of the much\r\nelongated squamosal with the jugal bone, both abutting against a downward\r\nprocess of the postfrontal bone. The skull shows a pair of wide\r\nsupratemporal foramina bordered by the parietals, squamosals, and\r\npostfrontals. The composition of the temporal arch varies considerably in\r\ndetail, and in _Cynognathus crateronotus_ at least there is a small hole\r\nwithin the arch, between the squamosal and jugal, probably the last remnant\r\nof the otherwise absent infratemporal foramen. Except in the roofed-in\r\nskulls of _Pareiasaurus_ and _Elginia_ there is no separate quadrato-jugal\r\nelement. The quadrate is firmly fixed by the overlapping squamosal, and the\r\nwhole pedicle for the support of the mandible is rather elongated, and\r\neither stands vertically or slants forwards. The mandible itself is\r\ncompound. The pterygoids extend backwards so as to approach or reach the\r\n{302}distal portion of the quadrate; separate ectopterygoids do not seem to\r\nbe developed. The shoulder-girdle consists on either side of a large\r\nscapula, which is mostly directed obliquely backwards, and is fused with\r\nthe coracoid; a precoracoid is present or at least indicated by a notch or\r\nforamen; it is usually fused with the other bones. At least some genera\r\npossess a T-shaped interclavicle and clavicles; _Pareiasaurus_ possesses\r\nalso a pair of cleithra.\r\n\r\nThe pelvis is in every respect constructed upon the Mammalian plan. The\r\nthree constituent parts meet at the acetabulum, and the ventral bones,\r\npubes and ischia, form one broad symphysis, leaving two, sometimes very\r\nsmall, obturator-foramina. The ilium is attached to one to five sacral\r\nvertebrae, and since the whole pelvis slants obliquely downwards and\r\nbackwards, this sacral attachment is distinctly pre-acetabular, perhaps\r\nmost markedly so in _Dicynodon_. The limbs are mostly stout, humerus and\r\nfemur with strong crests; the feet are thoroughly plantigrade, with five\r\nfingers and toes. The details of the carpus and tarsus are not well enough\r\nknown to permit of generalisation, but there is a tendency to form a heel,\r\nand to develop the cruro-tarsal joint into the chief joint of the hind\r\nfeet. The vertebrae are amphicoelous, sometimes with rather thin-walled\r\ncentra, so that in these cases the chorda was continuous. Intercentral\r\nwedges, or basiventral elements, are frequent in the cervical and caudal\r\nregions. Most of the ribs, especially those of the neck, have a tuberculum\r\nattached to the neural arch, and a distinct capitulum which articulates\r\neither with the centrum or with the intercentrum, or lastly, if the latter\r\nis absent, between two centra. The axis and atlas vertebrae are united.\r\n\r\nThe occipital condyle exhibits every stage between the single median knob\r\n(_Pareiasaurus_) formed almost entirely by the basioccipital bone, a triple\r\ncondyle (_Dicynodon_) to which both lateral and the basioccipital bones\r\ncontribute, and a kidney-shaped or double condyle (_Cynognathus_) from\r\nwhich the middle or basioccipital portion is more or less withdrawn.\r\n\r\nDermal bony armour reached an extraordinary development on the head of\r\n_Pareisaurus_ and _Elginia_; whether other parts of the body were protected\r\nis doubtful, but the flattened tops of the neural spines of _Pareiasaurus_\r\nsuggest that they carried bony scutes. Abdominal protective ossifications\r\nare unknown. {303}Many of the Theromorpha[126] reached a considerable size,\r\nmassive skulls of one foot in length being not uncommon. The tail was\r\ncomparatively short.\r\n\r\nThe many resemblances of these strange creatures to Mammals have naturally\r\nsuggested that the Mammalia have sprung from some such Theromorpha or\r\n\"beast-shaped\" animals. The resemblances are chiefly the dentition, the\r\nzygomatic arch, the pelvis, the cruro-tarsal joint, the scapula which is\r\nsometimes possessed of a spine, and the occasionally double occipital\r\ncondyle. The general shape of the skull of _Cynognathus_ is indeed\r\nstrikingly like that of a Carnivorous Mammal, and the shape of the whole\r\nbody suggests rather a Mammal than a reptile; and when we have to deal with\r\nthe fragmentary skulls of _Tritylodon_ (cf. p. 309) it is, indeed,\r\ndifficult to decide to which of the two classes such a creature belongs.\r\nBut the Theromorpha possess a number of important characters by which they\r\nreveal themselves at once as reptiles: (1) the large and fixed quadrate\r\nbone, which is still the sole support of the lower jaw; (2) the compound\r\nmandible, which is composed of at least an articular, dentary, angular,\r\nsupra-angular, and splenial element; (3) the interparietal foramen; (4) the\r\npossession of prefrontal and postfrontal bones, sometimes also postorbital,\r\nsupratemporal, and quadrato-jugal bones. Of course, any of these ancestral\r\nbones may be lost, and the interparietal hole may be closed as in tortoises\r\nand crocodiles. We can also imagine that the quadrate may be relieved of\r\nits jaw-bearing function and become loosened, but this is not easy,\r\nconsidering the strong development of the squamoso-quadrate pedicle. Those\r\nTheromorpha in which the quadrate itself is small, whilst the squamosal\r\nreaches down, or at least approaches the mandible, as in _Dicynodon_ and\r\n_Gordonia_, are so hopelessly pledged, or specialised in other directions,\r\nthat it is impossible to connect them ancestrally with Mammals.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is beyond reasonable question that the Mammals have sprung from\r\nsome reptilian stock (the attempts to derive {304}them from Amphibia,\r\nwithout the intervention of Reptiles, are as gratuitous as they have proved\r\nfutile), and the Theromorpha undoubtedly comprise creatures which of all\r\nanimals approach nearest to Mammals, and coincide with them in most\r\nimportant features. But we have not yet found a single Theromorph which can\r\nclaim to be a direct ancestor of Mammals. Since the latter occur already in\r\nthe Trias, we have to look for their reptilian forefathers at least in the\r\nLower Permian, and this naturally excludes all the known forms. The filling\r\nup of this gap is but a question of time.\r\n\r\nThe ancestry of the Theromorpha themselves is also shrouded in mystery.\r\nAttempts have been made to connect them with the Permian _Protorosaurus_,\r\n_Palaeohatteria_, and _Eryops_. On the other hand, some retain various\r\nStegocephalous reminiscences (_e.g._ the roofed-in condition of the skull\r\nby membrane-bones, amongst which, besides others, supratemporals and\r\npostorbitals can be recognised; occurrence of cleithra in _Pareiasaurus_;\r\ndistinct epiotic bones in _Elginia_). Although they have died out as a\r\ngroup, they have perhaps given rise to several side-branches, one of which\r\n(leaving aside the question of Mammalian origin) seems to have flourished\r\nas the Dinosauria.\r\n\r\nWe divide the Theromorpha into four orders, which are, however, liable to\r\nrun into each other, and it is reasonably to be hoped that many forms may\r\nbe discovered which will connect not only these provisional orders with\r\neach other, but also with other sub-classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. PAREIASAURI\r\n\r\nCranium completely roofed in by membrane-bones. The only foramina are the\r\nnostrils, orbits, and the interparietal foramen. The teeth are\r\ncomparatively small, and stand in even series in both jaws.\r\n\r\n_Pareiasaurus_, several species from the Karroo sandstone of South Africa.\r\n_P. baini_ was an extremely clumsy brute, of most uncouth appearance,\r\nstanding between 2 and 3 feet high, and measuring with the short tail\r\nnearly 8 feet in length. The skull is very massive, 18 inches long and\r\nslightly broader, with a rugose, deeply pitted surface. The teeth are\r\nthickly enamelled, serrated at the margin, with many pointed cusps; those\r\n{305}of the vomer, palatines, and pterygoids are recurved and arranged in\r\nseveral longitudinal rows. There is a small incisive foramen in the\r\npremaxilla; the choanae lie within the pterygoids. The palate has a pair of\r\nlarge lateral vacuities. Between the squamosal and quadrate is a small\r\nforamen, as in _Belodon_ and _Sphenodon_. The nares are terminal, bordered\r\nbehind by the nasals, and divided by the premaxillaries. The occipital\r\ncondyle is a single knob, but the lateral occipital bones also partake in\r\nits formation. The shoulder-girdle is strong. The scapula slants backwards,\r\nis broad, and possesses a longitudinal spine, an almost exclusively\r\nMammalian character. The scapula, coracoid and precoracoid are fused\r\ntogether, and are united ventrally with those of the other side. There is a\r\nT-shaped interclavicle, a pair of clavicles, and a pair of slender, long\r\ncleithra, which extend along the upper anterior margin of the scapulae. The\r\nhumerus possesses enormous crests. The broad ilium is attached to two, or\r\nperhaps three, sacral ribs. The acetabulum is closed. The pubes and ischia\r\nare united into one broad mass of bone, and the obturator-foramina seem to\r\nbe just large enough to permit of the passage of the nerve. Both fore- and\r\nhind-limbs are plantigrade and five-toed. The tibia articulates with one\r\nlarge bone, which is supposed to represent the united astragalus and\r\ncalcaneum, the latter being without an indication of a prominent heel,\r\nalthough there is a tendency to develop the crurotarsal into the chief\r\njoint. The number of vertebrae amounts to eighteen presacrals, eight to ten\r\nof which are cervicals. There are two or three sacral and about twenty-four\r\nmostly shortened caudal vertebrae. The latter possess intercentral wedges\r\nand chevron-bones; wedges occur also between the cervical and some thoracic\r\nvertebrae. Some of the posterior cervical ribs are very peculiar–straight,\r\nbroadened out, turned backwards, partly overlapped by one another, and 18\r\ninches long, recalling the first two ribs of the crocodiles. Sternum and\r\nabdominal ribs are unknown.\r\n\r\n_Elginia mirabilis._–The skull (Fig. 54, A, p. 280)–nothing else is\r\nknown–indicates one of the most remarkable reptiles hitherto found on this\r\nside of the Atlantic. It was discovered in the Red Sandstone of Elgin\r\n(Lower Trias). The skull reminds us in its general shape and by its spikes\r\nand horns of the little American Iguanoid lizard, _Phrynosoma_. The length\r\nof the cranium is about 6 inches, the distance between the tips of the two\r\nlargest {306}horns measures 9 inches. The teeth are small and resemble\r\nthose of an _Iguana_ in their shape and finely serrated edges, indicating\r\nherbivorous habits, but there are also several rows of smaller teeth on the\r\npalate, the configuration of which is not unlike that of _Sphenodon_. The\r\ntop and sides of the skull, except the interparietal foramen, the orbits,\r\nand nostrils, are completely encased by rugose, pitted, dermal bones, most\r\nof them with strange, horn-like spikes. In the encasement of the temporal\r\nregion can be discerned a postfrontal, parietal and squamosal, a conically\r\nprojecting epiotic, a postorbital and supratemporal, a jugal and a\r\nquadrato-jugal, which latter almost completely covers the quadrate bone.\r\nThe interparietal foramen lies far forwards, almost on a level with the\r\norbits. The nostrils are terminal, surrounded by the short nasals, the\r\nmaxillaries and the premaxillaries, which latter divide them.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. THERIODONTIA.\r\n\r\nThe cranium is not roofed in, but shows a pair of large supratemporal\r\nfossae, bordered below by the zygoma, which is formed mainly by the\r\nsquamoso-jugal bridge, and is shut off from the orbit by the postfrontal\r\njoining the bridge. The teeth are differentiated into incisors, canines,\r\nand molars (Fig. 54, C, p. 280). The lower canines close in front of the\r\nupper.\r\n\r\n_Cynognathus_, Karroo formation of South Africa. _C. crateronotus_ has a\r\nskull about 16 inches long, looking like that of a ferocious Carnivore;\r\nthere are four incisors, huge canines, and nine molars, the latter with\r\nserrated edges and anterior and posterior cusps. The wide supratemporal\r\nfossa is bordered and closed behind by the broad lateral extension of the\r\nparietal, which joins a similar extension of the squamosal bone. The latter\r\nis very long, extending to the postfrontal and to a bone which, bordering\r\nthe orbit posteriorly, is either an upward branch of the jugal, or a\r\npostorbital bone; the latter interpretation is made probable by the\r\noccurrence of a suture with the jugal in _C. platyceps_. The jugal bone is\r\nvery long, beginning at the quadrate, running along the squamosal, and\r\nforming the lower border of the orbit.\r\n\r\nThe number of vertebrae is large, there being as many as twenty-nine\r\npresacrals, six of which belong to the cervical region. {307}The atlas is\r\nfused with the axis; most of the thoracic ribs articulate partly upon the\r\nintercentra. The lumbar ribs are very peculiar; they are much expanded\r\nhorizontally, and overlap each other, forming thereby intercostal foramina.\r\nThe broad ilium is attached to three or four sacral ribs. The acetabulum is\r\nclosed. The ventral side of the pelvis shows a broad symphysis and has a\r\npair of obturator-foramina. The scapula is large, directed backwards, and\r\nshows a distinct, very Mammalian spine; it is fused with the coracoid and\r\nprecoracoid.\r\n\r\nThe occipital condyle of _C. platyceps_ is kidney-shaped, with the\r\nconcavity directed upwards; in _C. berryi_ it is separated into two\r\ndistinct knobs, the middle, basioccipital portion being apparently wanting.\r\nThe mandible possesses a long coronoid process which ascends obliquely into\r\nthe temporal fossa.\r\n\r\n_Aelurosaurus_, _Lycosaurus_, _Galesaurus_, and many others, likewise of\r\nthe Karroo formation. In the first genus the splenial bones help to form\r\nthe symphysis of the lower jaw; teeth are also found on the palate, in\r\nopposition to _Lycosaurus_. This has a skull 6 inches in length; the dental\r\nformula on either side is _i._ 4/3, _c._ 1/1, _m._ 5/5; the molars are\r\nslender, conical, and recurved. _Galesaurus_ seems to have been rather\r\nsmall, the low, triangular skull measuring only 2 to 3 inches in length,\r\nwith four or five sharply pointed incisors, prominent canines and four or\r\nfive small multicuspid or deeply serrated little molars.\r\n\r\n_Endothiodon_, with several species from the Karroo formation, is of\r\nuncertain systematic position, only imperfect skulls being known. The\r\nanimals must have been large and bulky, the skulls being very massive and\r\nat least one foot in length. The premaxillaries and the maxillaries are\r\ntoothless, their alveolar borders forming cutting, prominent edges. The\r\nsame applies to the very strong lower jaw; but there is a pair of\r\ntooth-like stout projections in the upper and lower jaws in the place of\r\ncanine teeth. True, enamelled, small, apparently conical or low and perhaps\r\nblunt teeth occur on either side in one or three longitudinal series upon\r\nthe palate, and in corresponding positions on the inner sides of the two\r\nhalves of the lower jaw. It is doubtful if the upper teeth are carried by\r\nthe palatines or by the broadened inner flanges of the maxillaries. The\r\nchoanae seem to lie between the pterygoids and the palatines, incompletely\r\nroofed in by ventral extensions of the latter towards the middle line.\r\n\r\n{308}Direct affinity of _Endothiodon_ (ἐνδοθί, within) with _Placodus_ is\r\nunlikely; the same applies to the Dicynodontia, although the restriction of\r\nthe teeth to the palate seems to point as much to the former genus as do\r\nthe toothless cutting edges of the jaws to the forms like _Oudenodon_.\r\n\r\nOther Theriodont reptiles have been described from the upper Permian of\r\nRussia, for instance _Deuterosaurus_ and _Brithopus_, but the determination\r\nrests upon insufficient fragments. North America has yielded many strange\r\nTheromorphous fossils, some of which may belong to the Theriodont order,\r\nwhile others seem to be intermediate between this and the other orders.\r\n_Diadectes_ of Texas, for instance, seems to be a Theriodont creature;\r\nwhile in _Empedias molaris_, with a skull about 8 inches in length, the\r\nteeth form an uninterrupted series without distinct canine tusks, and the\r\nincisors are distinguished from the molars only by the transversely\r\nbroadened shape of the latter. Very small teeth are arranged along the\r\nmedian line of the vomer and united palatine bones. In _Clepsydrops_,\r\n_Dimetrodon_, and _Naosaurus_ of Texas the teeth are differentiated into\r\nincisors, canines, and molars, although not so regularly as in the typical\r\nTheriodont forms described above, one or more pairs of teeth being enlarged\r\ninto canine-like tusks. In the latter two genera the spinous processes of\r\nthe thoracic vertebrae are enormously elongated, standing up vertically to\r\na height of 2 feet, while the centra of the vertebrae measure only one inch\r\nin diameter. In _Naosaurus claviger_ these upright spines carry on either\r\nside half a dozen transverse projections. _Stereorhachis_ of the Permian of\r\nFrance is typically Theriodont in the structure of its shoulder-girdle,\r\nhumerus, and pelvis, but the dentition is composed of 3/3 incisors, no\r\ncanines, and 6/10 pointed molars.\r\n\r\nThe following genera have been placed by Seeley in the family\r\nGomphognathidae. _Microgomphodon_, with broader and less prominently\r\nmulticuspid teeth than those of the typical Theriodonts, seems to lead to\r\n_Gomphognathus_, which has the following dentition: _i._ 3/3, _c._ 1/1,\r\n_m._ 12/12, with a long diastema between the canines and molars, some of\r\nwhich latter are nearly as broad as they are long, and have comparatively\r\nlow tubercles on the crowns. The skull is remarkably like that of a\r\nCarnivorous Mammal. There are incisive foramina behind the premaxilla. The\r\nmaxillaries and palatines form a united palatal roof, and behind them open\r\nthe {309}choanae. The occipital condyle is kidney-shaped. The mandible is\r\nmost extraordinary, approaching that of the Mammalian, especially the\r\nMarsupial type, except that it is still composed of several pieces. The\r\narticular facet for the mandible is borne by an outward or lateral\r\nprojection, while the bulk of the posterior half of the jaw projects\r\ninwards like a broad flange, undoubtedly recalling the so-called inner\r\ninverted angle of the Marsupial jaw. The coronoid process is large and\r\nextends far into the temporal fossa. Nearly the whole skeleton of\r\n_Microgomphodon_ is known; the lumbar ribs are broadened and overlap as in\r\n_Cynognathus_, and the mandible is typically compound, so that there is no\r\ndoubt about the affinities of this genus with the Theriodontia. It throws\r\nlight upon _Gomphognathus_ and the three likewise South African genera\r\n_Diademodon_, _Trirachiodon_ and _Tritylodon_, which are all known from\r\nimperfect skulls only. Their teeth are restricted to the jaws, the molars\r\nhave flat, multitubercular crowns and bear an extraordinary resemblance to\r\nthose of Mammals. Some of the molars of _Tritylodon_ are said even to\r\npossess two roots, but this point, absolutely unique in Reptiles, but\r\ncommon in Mammals, is not certain. The few upper incisors of _Tritylodon_\r\nare rather large, chisel-shaped, and extend like those of the Rodent-type\r\nback into the maxillaries; canines are absent, leaving a diastema.\r\n_Trirachiodon_ has prominent canines, the five upper molars are\r\nmultitubercular, rather flat, and much broader transversely than in the\r\nlongitudinal direction. Still, even these creatures, with skulls of the\r\nsize of that of a small fox, possessed distinct prefrontal and postfrontal\r\nbones, and are, at least in this respect, typical Reptiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER III. ANOMODONTIA.\r\n\r\nThe cranium is not roofed in. The pedicle for the suspension of the lower\r\njaw is much elongated, slants slightly forwards, and is composed of the\r\nlong quadrate, which is laterally overgrown by the squamosal bone. The\r\nteeth are restricted to a pair of strong, tusk-like canines, or they are\r\naltogether absent. The margins of the upper and especially those of the\r\nlower jaw are trenchant, and were possibly furnished with a thick horny\r\narmature like those of tortoises.\r\n\r\n{310}_Dicynodon_, with many species from the Karroo formation of South\r\nAfrica, reached formidable dimensions. The thick, curved skull is in size\r\nand outline not unlike that of a large lion, hence _D. leoniceps_, _D.\r\ntigriceps_, etc. The zygomatic arch is almost mammalian, except that the\r\nposterior boundary of the orbit is formed by a distinct postfrontal bone.\r\nThe nostrils are lateral. The canine tusks (Fig. 54, E, p. 280) are very\r\nlarge. The choanae open behind the rhomboid vomer and between the separated\r\npalatine bones, which are posteriorly confluent with the medially united\r\npterygoids. The latter send out flat extensions, along the lateral side of\r\nthe palatines; these extensions reach the maxillaries and probably\r\nrepresent the ectopterygoids. The occipital condyle is distinctly triple,\r\nbeing equally composed of the basi- and latero-occipital bones.\r\n\r\nThe three bones of the shoulder-girdle meet at the glenoid fossa; the\r\nscapula has the indication of a spine. The pelvis is stout, attached to\r\nfour or five vertebrae, converting the latter into a very Mammalian-like\r\nsacrum, the position of which lies distinctly in front of the acetabulum.\r\nThe latter is closed, composed by the three pelvic bones. The pubes and\r\nischia are fused together, leaving only a very small obturator-foramen. The\r\nlimbs are plantigrade and pentadactyle, very stout; the humerus and femur\r\nhave enormous crests.\r\n\r\n_Oudenodon_, of which several species have been described, is so much like\r\n_Dicynodon_, except for the complete absence of teeth, that it has been\r\nsuggested that these skulls belong to females of this genus. This view is\r\nstrengthened by the fact that tusk-like canines exist, or are absent in\r\nsome of the species which have been described as _Cistecephalus_, a genus\r\nclosely allied to _Dicynodon_. The latter, which, like _Oudenodon_ and\r\n_Cistecephalus_, occurred in Africa, extended also into India, _D.\r\norientalis_ having been found in the Panchet formation of Bengal, of\r\ntransitional age between the Permian and Triassic epochs. _Oudenodon\r\nrugosus_, on the other hand, has been described from the Ural.\r\n\r\n_Gordonia_ and _Geikia_, of the New Red Sandstone of Elgin, are known from\r\ntheir skulls only, but these are so well preserved that there is no doubt\r\nabout their close relationship to the typical South African Dicynodontia.\r\nThe skull of _Gordonia_ is about 7 inches long and 4 inches high. The\r\ncanines (Fig. 54, D, p. 280) are reduced to short, but thick, conical\r\ntusks. The most {311}remarkable feature is the very elongated\r\nsquamoso-jugal arch, which arises moreover from the dorsal end of the long\r\nsquamoso-quadrate pedicle. The two wide and long temporal fossae are\r\ndorsally divided by narrow parietal crests. There is a distinct\r\ninterparietal bone, and the usual interparietal foramen. The choanae are\r\nunited and lie within the palatines, which themselves are united; the large\r\nlateral palatal foramina are otherwise enclosed by the pterygoids,\r\nquadrates, and laterally by the squamoso-jugal arch.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER IV. PLACODONTIA.\r\n\r\nThese are the latest and last members of the Theromorpha, unfortunately\r\nknown from skulls only, from the Muschelkalk or Middle Trias of Germany and\r\nRussia. The skull of _Placodus gigas_ is about one foot long, rather high\r\nand triangular owing to the lateral expansion of the temporal arches, which\r\ndiverge posteriorly. The squamoso-jugal arch is very broad, and most of the\r\nposterior border of the orbit is formed by the large postorbital bone. The\r\nmaxillary bone seems to extend back to beyond the level of the orbits. The\r\nchoanae lie behind the premaxillaries. The palatines and pterygoids are\r\nfused in the middle line, forming a broad bony palate, which, owing to the\r\nbroad, posteriorly extended wings of the pterygoids, much resembles that of\r\nthe crocodiles. The teeth are very remarkable. There are two or three\r\nstout, conical, or chisel-like teeth in each premaxillary bone, and three\r\nto five broad and flat maxillary teeth; three pairs of huge, broad, and\r\nquite flat teeth are crowded together and fill up the whole vomerine and\r\npalatine portion of the palate. These crushing teeth indicate that\r\n_Placodus_ probably lived upon hard-shelled molluscs, and this would be in\r\nconformity with its occurrence in the Muschelkalk, which is a strictly\r\nmarine deposit and full of shells. Another closely allied genus is\r\n_Cyamodus_, one species of which is known from Russia. The teeth are fewer\r\nin number and not so large as those of _Placodus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{312}CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nCHELONIA–ATHECAE–THECOPHORA\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS IV.–CHELONIA._\r\n\r\nThere is no mistaking a tortoise. The shell and the horn-covered toothless\r\njaws separate them from all other four-footed creatures.\r\n\r\nThey may be described as terrestrial or aquatic, pentadactyle reptiles,\r\nwith walking limbs or with paddles; ribs with capitular portions only, two\r\nsacral vertebrae, humerus with entepicondylar foramen, pubes and ischia\r\nforming symphyses, quadrate bones fixed, jaws without teeth, but with\r\ncutting horny sheaths. Trunk encased in a bony shell, composed of numerous\r\ndorsal and ventral dermal bones, forming a carapace and a plastron, which\r\nmay or may not be covered with horny shields. Copulatory organ unpaired,\r\ncloacal opening more longitudinal than round, never transverse. Oviparous.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to distinguish the marine, paddle-limbed kinds as\r\n_Turtles_, the others as _Land-_ and _Water-tortoises_.\r\n\r\nTortoises occur already in the Trias. They reached their greatest\r\ndevelopment towards the end of the Mesozoic and in the earlier Tertiary\r\nperiods. They are now comparatively reduced in the number of families and\r\ngenera, although they are still represented by about 200 species. The\r\nsub-class as a whole is cosmopolitan, but does not occur in the colder\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nTheir origin is quite unknown. Of recent groups only the Crocodilia and the\r\nRhynchocephalia come into consideration. Combination of these groups with\r\nthe Chelonia leads to some unknown forms whence also the Theromorpha have\r\narisen. Palaeontology does not help us, all the leading, main groups of\r\nChelonia having been in existence in the earlier Mesozoic ages, {313}and\r\nPalaeozoic Chelonia are still unknown. We can, however, to a certain\r\nextent, reconstruct an ideal primordial Chelonian by assigning to it all\r\nthe ancestral characters actually observed in recent and fossil kinds, and\r\nby reducing to simpler conditions those features which we know to be more\r\nor less exaggerated specialisations. It is reasonable to assume that\r\noriginally each metamere, except those of the anterior half of the neck and\r\nthe posterior half of the tail, carried a transverse series of dermal\r\nplates, covered with horny shields, while the trunk, according to the\r\ngreater bulk of the body, increased in size, converging towards the root of\r\nthe neck and tail. By concentration, reduction of the number, and increase\r\nin the size of some of the remaining plates and shields, the skull assumed\r\nits characteristic box-like shape, the neck and tail becoming at the same\r\ntime free. Chelonia are without doubt descendants of terrestrial, or at\r\nleast semi-aquatic reptiles, and the marine paddled forms subsequently\r\ndeveloped from terrestrial kinds.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF CHELONIA.–After many vicissitudes it was recognised that\r\nthe Chelonia cannot naturally be divided according to the modification of\r\ntheir feet. The TRIONYCHOIDEA were clearly separated from the rest by\r\nStannius in 1854. Cope, in 1870, was the first to emphasise the important\r\ncharacter of the mode in which the neck is either bent sidewards\r\n(PLEURODIRA) or withdrawn in an S-shaped curve in a vertical plane\r\n(CRYPTODIRA); and he also separated _Sphargis_ as ATHECAE from all the\r\nother Chelonians, for which Dollo in 1886 proposed the term THECOPHORA. The\r\ndivision of the latter into recognisable families, based upon reliable,\r\nchiefly internal, skeletal, characters, has been effected by\r\nBoulenger;[127] and his classification has been adopted in the present\r\nvolume, after intercalation of the more important fossil forms. The\r\nrelationships between these various families may perhaps be indicated as\r\nfollows:–\r\n\r\n            { ATHECAE                        Sphargidae\r\n            {\r\n            {             { _Pleurodira_   { Pelomedusidae\r\n            {             {                { Chelydidae–Carettochelydidae\r\n            {             {\r\n  CHELONIA  { THECOPHORA  { _Cryptodira_   { Chelydridae–Dermatemydidae–\r\n            {             {                {   Cinosternidae\r\n            {             {                { Platysternidae\r\n            {             {                { Testudinidae–Chelonidae\r\n            {             {\r\n            {             { _Trionychoidea_  Trionychidae\r\n\r\n{314}The guiding taxonomic characters are fully mentioned at the head of\r\nthe different families, and are mostly internal. The following \"key,\"\r\nadapted from Boulenger, and based upon external characters, is preferable\r\nfor practical purposes.\r\n\r\n_For the position and names of the horny shields_ see Fig. 61 on p. 315.\r\n\r\n  Shell covered with horny shields.\r\n      Digits distinct, with 5 or 4 claws.\r\n          Pectoral shields separated from the marginals by inframarginals.\r\n              Tail long and crested.

No claws                        _Sphargidae_, p. 333.\r\n\r\nThe VERTEBRAE are, sometimes in the various regions of the same individual,\r\namphi-, opistho- or pro-coelous, or even biconvex. Traces of the chorda\r\nremain longest in the middle of the centra. Intercentra occur regularly on\r\nthe first two or three cervicals, and then again in the tail as paired or\r\nunpaired nodules, or as short chevrons. The latter occasionally fuse with\r\nthe caudal end of their centra. Intercentral discs of fibrous cartilage\r\noccur regularly in the neck and tail. The ribs develop originally in the\r\nsame transverse level with these discs, and frequently the anterior\r\nthoracic vertebrae retain this intercentral or intervertebral position\r\nthroughout life. Farther back they often show a gradual change from the\r\nintercentral to a more central and ultimately {315}remarkable to a purely\r\nneural attachment. In all the Chelonia the ribs are devoid of the\r\ntubercular portion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.–Various plastra and their horny shields. 1,\r\n_Testudo ibera_; 2, _Macroclemmys temmincki_; 3, _Cinosternum odoratum_; 4,\r\n_Sternothaerus nigricans_; 5, _Chelodina longicollis_; 6, _Chelone mydas_.\r\n_a_ or _an_, Anal shield; _abd_, abdominal shield; _f_ or _fem_, femoral;\r\n_g_ or _gul_, gular, unpaired in Fig. 3; _h_ or _hum_, humeral shield; _i_\r\nor. _int.g_, intergular; _im_, infra-marginals; _m_, marginals; _p_ or\r\n_pect_, pectoral; _x_, in Fig. 1, inguinal shield constituting, with the\r\naxillary _xx_, the last trace of infra-marginals.]\r\n\r\nThe cervical vertebrae have no ribs, except mere traces in the shape of\r\nsmall nodules. On the tail the ribs are often large, and, when fused with\r\ntheir neural supports, look like transverse processes; the whole\r\narrangement exactly resembles that of Crocodilia. The first pair of\r\nthoracic ribs, those borne by the ninth vertebra, are peculiar. They arise\r\nfrom the anterior portion of the centrum, are much reduced, sometimes to\r\nmere threads of bone, and lean against the anterior rim of the second pair\r\nof ribs, in many cases without reaching the carapace. The next following\r\nribs, those of the tenth to the sixteenth vertebra, are intimately involved\r\nin the formation of the first to seventh costal plates. The ribs of the two\r\nsacral vertebrae sometimes remain quite distinct throughout life, just\r\ntouching the upper {316}ends of the iliac bones; but since these find a\r\nmuch more effective support in the shell, the distal ends of the sacral\r\nvertebrae fuse with the eighth, or so-called last, pair of costal plates.\r\n\r\nThe neural arch of the ninth vertebra rests upon its centrum; but the\r\nneural arches of the other trunk-vertebrae, although long, rest upon two\r\ncentra; retaining, like the ribs, their original intercentral position; and\r\nin most cases the neuro-central sutures remain throughout life. The atlas\r\nand the last cervical vertebra deserve special attention. In many\r\ntortoises, _e.g._ _Trionyx_, _Clemmys_, _Testudo_, the three constituent\r\nparts of the atlas, namely, the neural arch, the centrum, and the\r\nintercentrum or first pair of united basiventralia, do not ankylose, but\r\nremain loosely connected; and the first centrum, instead of forming an\r\nodontoid process, remains movably attached to the second centrum, although\r\nit sometimes carries, and fuses with, the second intercentral piece. In\r\nother tortoises, _e.g._ _Platemys_ and _Chelys_, however, all the parts of\r\nthe atlas co-ossify and form a complete, solid vertebra which articulates\r\nby a concavo-convex joint with the centrum of the second vertebra. The\r\nnormal number of cervical vertebrae is eight in all Chelonians. The first\r\nspinal nerve issues between occiput and atlas, all the others behind the\r\nneural arches of their vertebrae. The last, or eighth cervical, owing to\r\nthe retractility of the neck, forms elaborate joints; its centre fits with\r\na knob into a cup of the ninth, and its post-zygapophyses form broad,\r\ncurved articulating concave facets for the reception of the anterior\r\nzygapophyses of the fixed ninth vertebra. In the Trionychidae the\r\nzygapophyses are most elaborate, and they alone articulate with the ninth\r\nvertebra, while the centra do not join, but remain, or rather become,\r\nseparated by partial resorption. In the Chelonidae, in conformity with the\r\nnon-retractile and short neck, all the cervical joints are much reduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.–1, The complete atlas of an adult _Trionyx hurum_.\r\nThe second basiventral (white) is attached to the posterior end of the\r\nfirst centrum, which, not being fused with the second centrum, is not yet\r\nan odontoid process. 2, The complete atlas of an adult _Trionyx\r\ngangeticus_, still typically temnospondylous. 3, The first and second\r\ncervical vertebrae of an adult _Platemys_. 4, The complete atlas of a\r\n_Chelys fimbriata_.]\r\n\r\n{317}[Illustration: FIG. 63.–Skull of _Chelone mydas_. A, from the left\r\nside; in B, the postfrontal and squamosal bones have been removed, and the\r\nbroad expansions of the jugal, quadrato-jugal, parietal, and quadrate bones\r\nhave been reduced in order to reduce the skull to more primitive\r\nconditions. _F_, Frontal; _J_, jugal; _L.o_, lateral occipital; _Mx_,\r\nmaxillary; _Op_, opisthotic; _Pal_, palatine; _Par_, parietal; _Prf_,\r\nprefrontal; _Pro_, pro-otic; _Pt.f_, postfrontal; _Ptg_, pterygoid; _Q_,\r\nquadrate; _Qj_, quadrato-jugal; _S.o_, supra-occipital; _Sq_, squamosal.]\r\n\r\nThe SKULL (cf. Fig. 54, H, I, K, p. 280) agrees fundamentally with that of\r\n_Sphenodon_ and of the _Crocodilia_, but it is characterised by several\r\nspecial features. There are no ectopterygoids or ossa transversa; no\r\nlacrymal bones, no interparietal or pineal foramen; the vomer is unpaired\r\nand the nasal bones are mostly absent, unless they are fused with the\r\nprefrontals. The premaxillae are very small. The single vomer forms a\r\nseptum between the choanae; and these are, except in _Sphargis_, ventrally\r\nroofed over by wings sent out by the palatines. The latter form a\r\ncontinuous bony roof to the mouth with the pterygoids, and these diverge\r\nposteriorly, being connected suturally with the quadrates, lateral and\r\nbasi-occipital bones, and with the unpaired basi-sphenoid, which appears\r\nbetween the basi-occipital and the diverging pterygoids, but is in most\r\ncases to a great extent overlapped by the latter. The occipital condyle is\r\ndistinctly triple; the basi-occipital sometimes helps to border the foramen\r\nmagnum. The supra-occipital sends out a long vertical blade, directed\r\nbackwards and generally projecting far over the neck, for the attachment of\r\nthe powerful cranio-cervical muscles. The quadrate is very peculiar. Firmly\r\nattached, and hemmed in on nearly all sides by the neighbouring bones, it\r\nstands nearly vertically and forms a broad articulating surface for the\r\nmandible. Its posterior side shows either a transverse, horizontal groove,\r\nin which lies the columella auris, or the groove is transformed into a more\r\nor less closed canal. Moreover, the hinder lateral margin of the quadrate\r\nforms most of the tympanic frame; its margins being curved backwards,\r\nleaving in the Cryptodira, however, a {318}wide notch behind; in the\r\nPleurodira this part of the quadrate is transformed into a trumpet, the\r\nwide rim of which, forming a complete ring, carries the tympanic membrane.\r\nThe tympanic cavity thus formed often leads into a deep recess which\r\nextends beneath the squamosal towards the opisthotic and bears some\r\nresemblance to the intricate tympanic recesses which pervade that region of\r\nthe Crocodilian skull.\r\n\r\nDorsally the quadrate is broadly overlaid by the squamosal, which\r\nfrequently forms an arch with the parietal. Anteriorly the quadrate is\r\nconnected through a variably sized quadrato-jugal with the jugal; and this,\r\nby joining the maxilla and postfrontal, helps normally to form the\r\nposterior rim of the orbit. All the bones which border the temporal fossa\r\nvary much in extent in the different groups of Chelonia. The extremes are\r\nrepresented by _Cistudo_ and _Geoemyda_, in which the bony infratemporal\r\narch is absent, owing to the loss of the quadrato-jugal; and on the other\r\nhand by the Chelonidae and by _Sphargis_, in which the whole temporal\r\nregion is covered over by an additional \"false cranial\" roof. This roof is\r\nproduced chiefly by lateral wing-like expansions of the parietal and\r\npostfrontal bones, which meet the likewise much expanded jugal,\r\nquadrato-jugal, and squamosal bones. In the lower diagram of Fig. 63\r\n(_Chelone mydas_) the squamosal has been removed, and the other bones have\r\nbeen reduced to their normal, or rather primitive condition, for comparison\r\nwith the external view of the complete skull of the same animal. The lower\r\ndiagram shows also the connexion of the pterygoid with a descending process\r\nof the parietal; this column, paired of course, usually contains a separate\r\nbone, the epipterygoid, the portion between _Ptg_ and _Par_.\r\n\r\nThe hyoidean apparatus is well developed, and sometimes assumes large\r\ndimensions, especially in _Chelys_. The two pairs of \"horns\" are the first\r\nand second branchial arches, whilst the hyoid arches are reduced to a pair\r\nof small, frequently only cartilaginous, nodules attached near the anterior\r\ncorners of the basis linguae, which generally fuses with the os entoglossum\r\nin the tip of the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe PECTORAL ARCH consists of a pair of long coracoids sloping obliquely\r\nbackwards, the distal cartilages of which scarcely touch each other in the\r\nmiddle line, and the scapulae. The upper end of the scapula frequently\r\ntouches the inside of the {319}first costal plate, protected by a\r\ncartilaginous pad. Near the glenoid cavity arises a long process (PC in\r\nFig. 65), placed transversely and approaching its fellow. The distal end is\r\nconnected with that of the coracoid by a fibro-cartilaginous band. The\r\nhomology of this scapular process is not quite clear. The band just\r\nmentioned favours the idea that the process represents the precoracoid, but\r\nits being an outgrowth from the scapula suggests that it is merely the much\r\nenlarged acromion. It certainly does not represent the clavicle, which\r\nforms part of the plastron: and this is not in contact with the\r\nshoulder-girdle at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.–Diagram of the skeleton of _Testudo elephantopus_,\r\nafter removal of the left half of the carapace. The plastron is roughly\r\nindicated by a section through the middle line. _Fe_, Femur, foreshortened;\r\n_Fi_, fibula; _H_, humerus; _Il_, ilium; _Is_, ischium; _P.P._, pubis; _R_,\r\nradius; _Scap_, scapula; _Tb_, tibia; _u_, ulna; 3, third cervical\r\nvertebra; 1, 3, 5, first, third, and fifth fingers; _XIII_, thirteenth\r\n(fifth thoracic) vertebra.]\r\n\r\nThe PELVIS is strong. Ilium, pubis, and ischium meet at the acetabulum. The\r\ndorsal end of the ilium is generally broadened, and is attached to one or\r\nboth sacral vertebrae, but it is also in contact with the superimposed last\r\ncostal plate. This additional connexion often becomes predominant and the\r\nsacral vertebrae are partly or completely relieved of the iliac support,\r\nfusing in this case more or less with the costal plates. The pubes have\r\nstrong lateral processes, directed obliquely forwards and downwards. The\r\npubes and the ischia, which latter are much smaller, form broad symphyses,\r\nand these are connected with each other by a longitudinal cartilaginous\r\nband (_Chelone, Trionyx_); or the connecting bridge is broad and quite\r\nossified (_Testudo_), forming in the latter case two roundish\r\nobturator-foramina. Cartilage frequently remains at the anterior end of\r\n{320}the pubic symphysis, and a smaller, longer, and narrow piece of\r\ncartilage extends sometimes backwards from the ischiadic symphysis, as the\r\nso-called hypo-ischium. In the Pleurodira the ends of the ilia, and those\r\nof the lateral processes of the pubes, are much broadened and firmly\r\nankylosed with the posterior costal plates and with the xiphiplastron\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.–Ventral view of the bony shell of _Chelone mydas_,\r\nthe Green Turtle, after removal of the plastron (Fig. 66).

In\r\n_Testudo_ the centrale is fused with the intermedium, and the first three\r\ndistal carpals are also fused together. In the marine turtles the limbs are\r\ntransformed into paddles, but all the bones retain their independence; the\r\npisiform {321}and the first metacarpal are enlarged and flattened, thereby\r\ngiving additional width to the paddle. The tarsus remains less primitive;\r\nthe centrale and the proximal elements have a tendency to fuse together,\r\nmost completely in land-tortoises; the fifth distal carpal is enlarged, and\r\nstands out hook-like from the rest. The number of the phalanges of the\r\nfingers and toes varies slightly. It is noteworthy that none of the\r\nChelonia possess more than three phalanges. The three middle fingers and\r\ntoes have mostly three phalanges; the pollex and hallux have always two;\r\nthe number of phalanges of the fifth finger varies from three to one, of\r\nthe fifth toe from two to none. The greatest reduction occurs in _Testudo_\r\nand its allied genera of typical land-tortoises, _Homopus_, _Pyxis_, and\r\n_Cinixys_, the formula for the fingers being 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 or 1, and 2, 2,\r\n2, 2, 0 for the toes. In _Pelomedusa_ all the fingers possess two phalanges\r\nonly, owing to fusion of the first and second phalanges with each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.–The bones composing the plastron of _Chelone\r\nmydas_.

We restrict ourselves to a description of the shell of the\r\nThecophora, leaving the discussion of the peculiar shell of _Sphargis_ to\r\np. 336 f. Very young tortoises are still soft, and the plates which are\r\nbeginning to ossify are not yet suturally united. The plastron (Figs. 66\r\nand 67) consists of the paired epi-, hyo-, hypo-, and xiphi-plastral\r\nplates, and the unpaired endo-plastral plate.\r\n\r\n{322}[Illustration: FIG. 67.–Bony shell of _Testudo ibera_.

In the young of all tortoises, and in the adult of\r\nthe Chelonidae and Trionychidae, the several plastral plates enclose large,\r\nirregularly-shaped fontanelles. These are more or less filled up in the\r\nother groups; and in the Testudinidae especially the whole plastron forms\r\none continuous mass. The navel is situated between the hyo- and\r\nhypo-plastrals. Both these pairs are broader than the others, and are\r\nconnected with the carapace by {323}means of several marginals. The\r\nconnecting region is called the bridge. In several tortoises, e.g. _Emys_,\r\nthe connexion with the marginals is formed by ligaments only and remains\r\nmovable. In others, transverse, more or less perfect hinges are formed\r\nacross the plastron. A rather imperfect joint between the hypo- and\r\nxiphi-plastrals develops with age in _Testudo ibera_. In _Cistudo_ and\r\n_Cyclemys_ a very effective hinge lies below the hyo- and hypo-plastrals,\r\njust in front of the bridge; and the anterior and posterior lobes of the\r\nplastron can be closed against the inner rim of the box, fitting tightly in\r\n_Cistudo_. In _Pyxis_ the front lobe only is movable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.–A, Diagrammatic transverse section through the\r\nshell of _Testudo_.

The median series consists of one large nuchal plate, normally eight\r\nneurals and one to three supracaudal plates. The characteristic feature of\r\nthe neural plates is that they are firmly fused with the broadened neural\r\nspinous processes of the underlying vertebrae. The nuchal plate lies in\r\nfront of the first thoracic or ninth vertebra; it overlies the last\r\ncervical vertebrae, with the eighth of which it is connected by ligament\r\nonly; but the posterior corner of the plate often fuses with the spine of\r\nthe ninth vertebra. In the Chelydridae, and still {324}more in the\r\nTrionychidae, the nuchal sends out a pair of long rib-like processes, which\r\neither extend to below some of the neighbouring marginals, or their ends\r\noverlap those of the ribs of the second thoracic vertebra (e.g. _Trionyx_),\r\nor, lastly, they are in turn overlapped by the first costal plates (e.g.\r\n_Cyclanorbis_). Such rib-like processes are also present, well developed in\r\nthe young, shorter in the adult, in the Dermatemydidae and Cinosternidae.\r\nIt is possible that the nuchal plate represents the fused neural of the\r\neighth and the costal plates of the ninth vertebrae. An indication of the\r\ncompound nature of the nuchal may be found in the fact that two nuchals\r\nhave been described in _Chelydropsis carinata_, a Miocene relation of\r\n_Chelydra_. Somewhat similar modifications have taken place in the\r\npost-sacral region. The one to three supracaudal plates are, namely,\r\nneurals which have lost their connexion with, or perhaps have never been\r\nfused with, the spinous processes of the movable tail-vertebrae. The number\r\nof neural plates is mostly eight, but there are sometimes individually nine\r\nor ten, the gradual suppression taking place first in the sacral region.\r\nWhen such a plate is suppressed the neighbouring costal plates usually\r\nclose up and meet in the median line. In _Cistudo_, for instance, there are\r\nonly seven normal neurals, the eighth pair of costals meet, and the\r\noriginal eighth neural is transformed into a supracaudal. In _Cinosternum_\r\nthe sixth to eighth costals meet, separating the one supracaudal widely\r\nfrom the remaining five neurals. The meeting of the last pair of costals,\r\nwith co-ordinate reduction of the neurals to seven, is almost universal in\r\nthe Pleurodira; and this tendency is carried out to an extreme in the\r\nBrazilian _Platemys_ and in the Australian _Chelodina_ and its allies, in\r\nwhich all the costals meet in the middle line, and the neurals are\r\ncompletely suppressed. Every stage intermediate between complete neurals\r\n(_Sternothaerus_) and interrupted, vestigial, and vanished neurals, is\r\nstill represented by some genus. This process takes place independently,\r\nboth in America and in Australia, and is one of the most recently\r\nintroduced modifications.\r\n\r\nThe costal plates arise, like the neurals, independently in the cutis, but\r\nthey soon come into contact with the underlying cartilage of the ribs,\r\nwhich are long enough to reach the marginals. The ribs flatten, become\r\nsurrounded by the growing membrane-bone of the plates, and the cartilage of\r\nthe ribs, {325}instead of ossifying, undergoes a process of calcification.\r\nUltimately this is more or less absorbed, its place is taken by the dermal\r\nbone, which forms so to speak a cast of the rib, preserving in many cases\r\nthe shape of the vanished rib, only the capitular portions of which remain\r\nunaffected. The number of costal plates is very constant, namely eight on\r\neach side, but some fossils have nine or ten, and there are still\r\nindividual variations in recent forms, indicative of that number. In a\r\nlarge _Chrysemys concinna_ I find the last pair of costals clearly composed\r\nof at least two pairs, and this same specimen has nine distinct neural\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nThe marginal plates are originally paired, almost always eleven pairs, very\r\nrarely ten or twelve; an unpaired posterior plate, the pygal, is always\r\npresent, and is probably the result of fusion. In the Chelonidae large\r\nfenestrae remain between the costal and marginal plates, only covered by\r\nleathery unossified cutis, and of course by the horny shields. In the\r\nIndian fresh-water genus _Batagur_ similar windows are gradually filled up\r\nwith age, and the horny shields become extremely thin and almost confluent.\r\nOn the other hand, in _Testudo polyphemus_, the bony shell, always very\r\nthin, becomes still thinner with age and finally fenestrated by absorption.\r\n\r\nGreat reduction has taken place in the carapace of the Trionychidae. The\r\nAmerican species of _Trionyx_ have only seven pairs of costal plates; in\r\n_Cyclanorbis_ the neurals are reduced to two. The whole dorsal shell is\r\nmuch smaller than the body, and marginal plates are absent or merely\r\nvestigial. It is doubtful if the ossifications in the posterior half of the\r\nmarginal flap of some genera are homologous with true marginals.\r\n\r\nExternally the whole shell is covered, except in the _Trionychidae_, in\r\n_Sphargis_ and _Carettochelys_ with horny, epidermal shields. These are\r\nphylogenetically older than the dermal plates, and they do not correspond\r\nwith them either in numbers or in position, although there exists a general\r\nresemblance in their arrangement. On the plastron we distinguish an\r\nunpaired or paired gular, and a pair of gular, humeral, pectoral,\r\nabdominal, femoral, and anal shields (Fig. 66). Sometimes there are also\r\nintergulars, paired in _Macroclemmys_ and _Chelys_, unpaired in _Chelone_;\r\nin many of the Pleurodira an unpaired intergular lies behind the gulars.\r\n\r\n{326}The carapace of most Chelonians is covered with five neural, four\r\npairs of costal and twelve pairs of marginal _shields_, the last of which\r\noften forms an unpaired pygal. In front of the first neural lies the nuchal\r\nshield, very variable in size, often absent. The Chelydridae,\r\nDermatemydidae, Platysternidae, and Cinosternidae possess moreover several\r\ninframarginals, intercalated on the bridge between the marginal and some of\r\nthe plastral shields. In many of the other families these inframarginals\r\nare restricted to the anterior and posterior corners of the bridge, as the\r\nso-called axillaries and inguinals, mostly small and variable. Lastly,\r\n_Macroclemmys_ has several small supramarginals.\r\n\r\nThere are consequently eleven longitudinal rows of shields in all; by\r\nelimination of the supra- and infra-marginals they are reduced to seven\r\nrows. It is absolutely certain that the number of transverse rows also was\r\noriginally much greater than it is now. The mode of reduction of the number\r\nof the neural and costal shields has been studied in _Thalassochelys\r\ncaretta_ (cf. p. 388.) The accompanying illustration (Fig. 69) shows some\r\nof the main stages actually observed in the reduction of these shields. The\r\nchief point is that certain shields are squeezed out, or suppressed by\r\ntheir enlarging neighbours. The ultimate result is the formation of fewer,\r\nbut larger shields.\r\n\r\nEach shield grows individually as follows. Every year, or rather during\r\nevery periodically recurring period of growth, the area of the Malpighian\r\nlayer belonging to each shield increases peripherally in size, and at the\r\nsame time produces a new layer of horn. The original little shield, with\r\nwhich the tortoise is born, remains for years, often throughout life, as\r\nthe so-called \"areola;\" it increases in thickness owing to the new layer of\r\nhorn added from below, and peripherally the increase in size is indicated\r\nby the overlapping concentric rings. Each ring represents a year's growth,\r\nat least in tortoises which live in temperate zones, where hibernation\r\nmeans a complete suspension of growth. It is not known if the same applies\r\nto tropical species, which grow either throughout the year, or which\r\nundergo one or more periods of rest. The areola does not remain central;\r\nthe growth is uneven. With age the oldest layers of the areola are\r\nfrequently rubbed off, and the areola then appears enlarged.\r\n\r\n{327}[Illustration: FIG. 69.–Diagrams illustrating the progressive\r\nreduction of the horny shields in various Chelonians. The shields, the fate\r\nof which it is desired to follow, are indicated by distinctive shading. I.\r\nHypothetical, primitive stage. Eight neural (including the nuchal) and\r\neight costal shields. Both neurals and costals lie in the same transverse\r\nplanes. II.-VII. Successive stages in the reduction and suppression of\r\nvarious shields, observed in specimens of _Thalassochelys_, the normal\r\ncondition of which is represented by VII. VIII. Six neurals and only four\r\ncostals. The normal condition of _Chelone_. IX. The nuchal shield has\r\nbecome very small and the resulting gap has been filled up by an\r\nenlargement of the first pair of marginals. This is the normal condition of\r\nmost Cryptodirous tortoises. X. The first marginals meet in front and the\r\nnuchal is either suppressed (X_a_[X^a in diag]), _e.g._ in several species\r\nof _Testudo_, or it is surrounded by the marginals (X_b_), _e.g._ in\r\n_Sternothaerus_. (From Willey's _Zool. Results_, 1899.)]\r\n\r\n{328}For the first dozen years or so the annual rings can be easily\r\nfollowed, but when the creature approaches maturity each shield adds very\r\nlittle to its growth, and the rings become very fine, crowded and\r\nirregular. Only by careful counting and comparison of the rings on the\r\ncostals, marginals, and plastrals, can a reliable average be arrived at. In\r\nsome tortoises, e.g. _Chrysemys_, the whole outer layer of the shields\r\npeels off periodically; only a thin smooth layer like mica or tracing-paper\r\nremains, of course without any indication of rings. The pigment is formed\r\nin the Malpighian layer, but it frequently diffuses into the horny shields\r\nthemselves, notably in _Chelone imbricata_, which yields the beautiful\r\n\"tortoise-shell.\" The colour of the pigment is either black, yellow, or\r\nred, with resulting combinations. The green colour, often so beautiful in\r\nbaby-specimens of _Chrysemys_, is optical, produced, according to Agassiz,\r\nby a network of black pigment, spread over a layer of yellow oil.\r\n\r\nHorny scales, sometimes forming spines, and covering a nodule of dermal\r\nossification, are also common on other parts of the skin, especially on the\r\nlimbs of land-tortoises, and also on the tail of _Chelydra_. Sometimes the\r\nend of the tail is protected by a claw-like nail, for instance in _Pyxis_.\r\nIn some of the gigantic land-tortoises, and in _Chelone mydas_, this nail\r\nassumes large dimensions, and several of the terminal caudal vertebrae are\r\nfused together into a regular urostyle. In some subfossil specimens of\r\nMauritian tortoises, these ankylosed complexes are 12 cm. long and more\r\nthan 5 cm. broad!\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the description of the shell, it is worth while to draw\r\nattention to the enormous correlative changes in other organs produced by\r\nthis case. Nearly the whole organism has been altered. The hard, firm\r\ncarapace has partly rendered the supporting functions of the vertebral\r\ncolumn unnecessary or impossible. In many tortoises, especially in the\r\nlarge land-tortoises, the vertebrae and the capitular portions of the ribs\r\nare reduced to mere bony outlines; the reduction to thin paper-like bony\r\nlamellae proceeds with age. The iliac bones find a better support in the\r\ncostal plates; the contact with the sacral ribs is given up, and these ribs\r\nfuse partly with the costal plates, or they are absorbed. The whole mass of\r\nmuscles of the trunk is completely lost in the region of the shell, but\r\ntraces of them exist in young specimens. Neck, limbs, and tail can in most\r\ncases be withdrawn and hidden in the shell. When this is not possible it is\r\ndue to secondary changes. The neck is withdrawn either by being tucked away\r\n{329}sideways (Pleurodira[129]), or by being bent in an S-shaped curve in a\r\nvertical plane. In a left-sided profile-view of the animal, the head\r\nrepresents the tail of the S. The neck is withdrawn by long muscles, which\r\nare inserted into the ventral side of the middle of the neck, and extend in\r\nthe shape of vertical ribbons far back into the shell, arising from the\r\ncentra of some of the middle or even more posterior thoracic vertebrae.\r\n\r\nLastly, a few remarks on the PARTIAL REGENERATION, or the mending of\r\ninjuries to the shell. If part of the horny covering is badly bruised, torn\r\noff, or rubbed through, or if part of the shell is crushed, the underlying\r\nportion of the bony plate becomes necrotic, and the horny covering also\r\ndies so far as its Malpighian layer is destroyed. Soon, however, the\r\nuninjured Malpighian cells, around the margin of the wound, multiply, grow\r\ninto and beneath the injured portion of the bone, and form a new horny\r\nlayer, casting off the necrotic portion. After several months the\r\ndeficiency is patched up; new bone has grown in the deeper remaining strata\r\nof the cutis, and the outside is covered by a continuous horny layer,\r\nwithout, however, reproducing the original concentric moulding of the\r\nshields. In badly crushed shells sometimes almost one-third of the whole\r\nshell is thus cast off and mended within one or two years. The regeneration\r\nof the forcibly stripped-off shields of _Chelone imbricata_ is described on\r\np. 386. Bitten-off tails and limbs, rather frequent occurrences in\r\nwater-tortoises, are of course not reproduced, but the wounds are healed\r\nand covered again with scaly skin.\r\n\r\nSENSE-ORGANS.–The EYE is by far the best developed sense-organ. It is\r\ncomparatively small. The pupil is round. The iris is mostly dark in\r\nterrestrial forms, while in water-tortoises it is often brightly coloured,\r\nfor instance pale yellow in _Chelodina_, greenish and mottled with black,\r\npale grey, brown, etc., in various species of _Chrysemys_. _Cistudo_\r\npresents a curious sexual dimorphism; the males have red, the females\r\nbrown, eyes. The sclerotic wall contains a ring of numerous small ossified\r\nplates. There is no trace of a pecten. The eye is protected externally by\r\nthe two lids and the nictitating membrane. In some water-tortoises, notably\r\nin _Chelodina_, the lower lid is transparent. Lacrymal and Harderian glands\r\nare present.\r\n\r\n{330}The SENSE OF HEARING is apparently not very acute, although tortoises\r\nand turtles are frightened by noise, and can distinguish sounds; otherwise\r\nthey would have no voice, which is very tiny and piping in most tortoises\r\nduring the pairing season. In most water-tortoises the tympanic membrane is\r\nthin and quite exposed; in land-tortoises it is often thick and covered by\r\nthe ordinary skin; lastly, in _Chelone_ the tympanic cavity is filled with\r\na plug of the much-thickened skin, possibly in adaptation to the\r\nwater-pressure when these creatures dive to considerable depths. The\r\nossicular chain is mostly reduced to a long, bony, columellar rod.\r\n\r\nThe SENSE OF SMELL is well developed. All Chelonians carefully smell their\r\nfood, in the air as well as under water. The individual predilection shown\r\nby many species for different kinds of animal and vegetable food,–since\r\nthey are, for instance, able to distinguish between the various sorts of\r\ncabbage, cauliflower, sprouts, etc.,–proves that they possess a\r\nconsiderable amount of smell and taste.\r\n\r\nTortoises have a fine sense of touch; even the slightest tap on the shell\r\nis noticed, and the skin of the soft parts is extremely sensitive. Tickling\r\nof the sides of the tail, or of the hinder surface of a thigh, produces\r\nridiculous scratching actions of the same or of the opposite foot.\r\n\r\nThe DIGESTIVE APPARATUS is simple. Only a few peculiarities need be\r\nmentioned. The tongue is mostly broad and soft; it cannot be protruded. The\r\noesophagus of the Chelonidae is covered with many conical projections\r\npointing towards the stomach. The latter is simple, except in _Sphargis_.\r\nThe intestine is devoid of a caecum, but the difference between the small\r\nintestine and the rectum is very marked and often abrupt. The cloaca is\r\nvery roomy. It contains the large copulatory organ, which is unpaired,\r\ngrooved on its dorsal side, and is altogether constructed like that of the\r\nCrocodilia. The large bladder opens ventrally into the urodaeum, a recess\r\nof the cloaca; near its base open the urinary and genital ducts. Many\r\nwater-tortoises possess also a pair of lateral thin-walled sacs, the\r\nso-called anal sacs, dorso-lateral diverticula of the walls of the\r\nurodaeum. These sacs, which have highly vascularised walls, are incessantly\r\nfilled and emptied with water through the vent, and act as important\r\nrespiratory organs. When such a water-tortoise, for instance an _Emys_ or a\r\n_Clemmys_, is suddenly taken out of the water, it squirts out a {331}stream\r\nof this water, which is not, as is generally supposed, the urine from the\r\nbladder.\r\n\r\nThe mode of RESPIRATION is interesting. The lungs are very complicated,\r\nhighly-developed, spongy structures. They are attached by their whole\r\ndorsal surface to the inner lining of the shell. As they cannot expand\r\nthrough their own initiative, and since the shell has made costal and\r\nabdominal expansion impossible, the tortoise has to resort to other means\r\nof producing the necessary vacuum. This is done partly by the neck and the\r\nlimbs, which act like pistons in being drawn in and out; partly by the\r\ngreatly developed hyoidean apparatus, by which, when the neck is stretched\r\nout, the throat is alternately inflated and emptied, the air being\r\nswallowed, or pumped into the lungs. Additional respiration, besides that\r\nof the anal sacs mentioned above, is effected in various aquatic tortoises\r\nby slightly vascularised recesses of the pharyngeal region. Most Chelonians\r\ncan exist for a very long time without breathing; sulky individuals remain\r\nfor hours or days under water. _Cistudo_ can shut itself up for an equally\r\nlong time. Nevertheless this and other land-tortoises easily get drowned.\r\n\r\nAll Chelonians lay white EGGS, round or oval, according to their kind, but\r\nthe shape of the eggs of one set sometimes varies within the greatest\r\nlimits. The shell varies from a parchment-like, flexible, scarcely\r\ncalcareous cover to a hard, well-polished case. As a rule the eggs,\r\nimbedded in the ground, are hatched after a few months, but in some of the\r\nnorthern kinds, e.g. _Emys orbicularis_, the hatching is deferred until the\r\nnext spring, the embryo's development being arrested during the winter. How\r\nsuch eggs, buried a few inches only below the surface, withstand the often\r\nvery severe North German and Russian winter is a mystery. Whilst the\r\nplastron is generally flat, it is more or less concave in the males of many\r\nspecies, notably in _Testudo_, _Cistudo_, and _Emys_.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusions which can be drawn from the present GEOGRAPHICAL\r\nDISTRIBUTION of the Chelonia are as few and unsatisfactory as those\r\napplying to the Crocodilia, since all the main groups of Chelonians, and\r\nmany more extinct families, occurred together in bygone ages in the same\r\ncountries, for instance in Europe.\r\n\r\n{332}[Illustration: FIG. 70.–Geographical distribution of Cryptodirous\r\ntortoises.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.–Geographical distribution of Pleurodirous\r\ntortoises.]\r\n\r\nThe marine forms are naturally cosmopolitan, but the _Testudinidae_ are\r\nlikewise cosmopolitan, except in the Australian region. The _Chelydridae_,\r\nnow restricted to North and Central America, occurred formerly also in\r\nEurope. The _Pleurodira_, in Mesozoic times plentiful in Europe, India, and\r\nNorth America, are now restricted to South America, Australia, and Africa;\r\nthe _Pelomedusidae_ to Africa, Madagascar, and South America; the\r\n_Chelydidae_ to South America and Australia. In the latter country all the\r\nChelonians belong to the Chelydidae. The _Trionychoidea_, occurring since\r\nthe Cretaceous epoch in North America, in Early and Mid-Tertiary times in\r\nEurope, are now restricted to North America, Asia, and Africa. The country\r\nrichest in Chelonians is America; North and Central America together\r\npossessing representatives of all the families except the Pleurodira, and\r\nthese we know to have died out there. The _Dermatemydidae_,\r\n{333}_Cinosternidae_, and Chelydridae are now restricted to the Nearctic\r\nsub-region (including Central America). Poorest in genera and species, all\r\nof them Chelydidae, is the Australian region, where no fossils of other\r\nfamilies have yet been discovered. Europe, with its few Testudinidae, does\r\nnot come into consideration; Asia has at least Testudinidae and\r\nTrionychidae, and in addition the solitary _Platysternum_ in Indo-China,\r\nrepresentative of a family whose affinities with the Chelydridae again\r\nproclaim the validity of the Periarctic region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.–Geographical distribution of Trionychidae and\r\nChelydidae.]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I.

SPHARGIDAE.–_Sphargis_ s. _Dermatochelys coriacea_, the Leathery\r\nTurtle or Luth, is the only recent species and is the largest of all recent\r\nChelonians. The biggest specimen in the national collection is about six\r\nfeet and a half long, from the nose to the end of the shell, which latter\r\nis about four feet long; such a specimen may weigh half a ton. Agassiz,\r\nhowever, says that he has seen some \"weighing over a ton.\" The general\r\ncolour is dark brown, either uniform or with yellow spots. The Leathery\r\nTurtle has a wide distribution, ranging over all the intertropical seas,\r\nbut it is rare everywhere; least so perhaps in the Western Atlantic from\r\nFlorida to Brazil and in the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\n{334}[Illustration: FIG. 73.–_Sphargis coriacea_, the \"Leathery Turtle,\"\r\nyoung specimens, ventral and dorsal views. × 1.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Agassiz it breeds regularly every year in the spring on the\r\nBahamas, on the Tortugas, and on the coast of Brazil, depositing its many\r\neggs on the sandy shore like other turtles. Accidentally it visits the\r\nnorthern coast up to Long Island, and specimens, perhaps carried with the\r\nGulf Stream, have been caught on the coasts of Europe, for instance off\r\nDorsetshire. One was caught near Nantes in 1729, and is said to have made a\r\nterrible noise when being killed. This is perhaps the reason why Merrem in\r\n1820 invented the generic name _Sphargis_, supposed to be derived from\r\nσφαραγέω (I make a noise). It has also been recorded from the\r\nMediterranean. It seems to be entirely carnivorous, living upon Molluscs,\r\nCrustacea, and fish. The flesh is supposed to be unwholesome. It is a very\r\ncurious fact that of this rare species only large specimens, besides a very\r\nfew baby-turtles, are known or preserved in collections, while individuals\r\nof intermediate size, say from four inches to three feet in length, have\r\nnever been recorded. If it were not for the fact that they are still known\r\nto breed, it would look as if the {335}species were dying out. Perhaps they\r\nare very shy, leading a pelagic life, diving at the least sign of danger,\r\nand coming near the land only for the sake of breeding.\r\n\r\nThe structure of _Sphargis_ is so peculiar in many respects that it\r\ndeserves a somewhat full account. The neuro-central sutures persist on all\r\nthe vertebrae. The eight cervicals are short. All the ten trunk-vertebrae\r\ncarry ribs, and these, with the exception of the last, articulate between\r\nthe centra and with the neural arches; the first and tenth ribs are short,\r\nthe others are long and flattened, but not broad, with wide spaces between\r\nthem. The tail is short, although it consists of about twenty vertebrae;\r\nthese are devoid of chevrons.\r\n\r\nThe skull superficially resembles that of _Chelone_, chiefly owing to the\r\ncompletely roofed-in temporal region. The supraoccipital crest is rather\r\nshort, covered completely by the parietals, the posterior margin of which\r\nis rounded off instead of forming, as in the Chelonidae, a long projecting\r\ntriangular crest with the supra-occipital. The parietals are in broad\r\ncontact with the postfrontals, posteriorly they are just reached by the\r\nsquamosals. The quadrato-jugal is small, separated from the postfrontal by\r\nthe meeting of the squamosal with the jugal. The quadrate is notched\r\nbehind, and it separates the opisthotic from the squamosal. The\r\nbasisphenoid is large and broad, extending far forwards so as to separate\r\nthe pterygoids widely from each other except in their anterior portions,\r\nwhich, instead of sending a lateral arm to the jugal and maxillary, as in\r\n_Chelone_, are widely separated from these bones by the palatines. The\r\nchoanae lie on either side of the anterior half of the vomer, and are not\r\nroofed over by ventral vomero-palatine wings.\r\n\r\nThe limbs and their girdles are essentially like those of the Chelonidae,\r\nbut are not derivable from them. The most remarkable feature is the shell.\r\nThe dorsal and ventral halves are directly continuous, forming one unbroken\r\ncase all round, which is composed of many hundreds of little bony plates,\r\nirregularly polygonal, fitting closely into each other with their sutural\r\nedges, and giving the shell a beautiful mosaic appearance. On the dorsal\r\nside are a median row and three pairs of lateral rows of larger plates, and\r\nthese form seven longitudinal blunt ridges which all converge towards the\r\ntriangularly pointed tail-end of the shell. The ridges are not so much\r\nproduced by thickened {336}or spine-like edges of the plates, but by the\r\nright and left halves of the plates being actually bent at an angle. This\r\nis most conspicuous at the sides of the shell where it passes into the\r\nventral portion. The latter has two pairs of lateral and one median ridge.\r\nThe whole shell has consequently twelve ridges. The mosaic plates are\r\ndeeply imbedded in the cutis, being externally as well as internally\r\ncovered or lined with dense leathery skin. The epiderm is thin, and shows\r\nno indications of horny scales. In young specimens the whole shell is soft\r\nand very imperfectly ossified, later on it is quite rigid, although\r\ncomparatively thin. It is nowhere in contact with the internal skeleton,\r\nexcept by a nuchal bone, which by a descending process articulates with the\r\nneural arch of the eighth cervical vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe affinities of the Sphargidae and their position in the system are still\r\ndebatable. Whilst some authorities, _e.g._ Cope, Dollo, and Boulenger look\r\nupon _Sphargis_ as the sole remnant of a primitive group in opposition to\r\nall the other recent Chelonia, Baur considered it the most specialised\r\ndescendant of the Chelonidae. Dames agreed with him. Van Bemmelen has\r\nmodified this view in so far as he regards _Sphargis_ as the most\r\nspecialised Chelonian, but considers the differences between it and the\r\nChelonidae great enough to conclude that both Sphargidae and Chelonidae\r\nrepresent two independent, partly parallel, branches which have arisen from\r\ntwo different groups of terrestrial tortoises. Case,[130] from the study of\r\n_Protostega_ and other fossil forms, tends towards Baur's view. He believes\r\nthat _Sphargis_ is the culminating form of a branch which through\r\n_Psephophorus_ and with _Eosphargis_ has sprung from some creature like\r\n_Lytoloma_, which at the same time is the starting-point of another branch\r\nwhich culminates in the genera _Thalassochelys_ and _Chelone_, while lastly\r\na third branch contains _Protostega_, _Protosphargis_, and\r\n_Pseudosphargis_. In other words, he considers them all Chelonidae. If he\r\nis right we have of course no business to separate _Sphargis_ with its\r\nfossil allies from the rest of the Chelonia as \"Athecae.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, Case has not proved his point. It is easy enough to understand\r\nthat the characters of the cranium and plastron of _Sphargis_ are in a\r\ncondition which by partial reduction can be derived from that of typical\r\nChelonidae. The structure of the {337}cervical vertebrae, the absence of\r\nthe marginal plates and the peculiar articulation of the nuchal with the\r\nlast cervical vertebra can be explained as convergent analogies, just like\r\nthe paddles of _Carettochelys_. But the shell of _Sphargis_ is\r\nfundamentally different from and not homologous with that of the others.\r\nCope was therefore quite justified in distinguishing the Sphargidae as\r\n\"Athecae\" in opposition to the others which Dollo later on, by contrast,\r\nnamed \"Thecophora.\" Unfortunate names, since both groups are undeniably in\r\npossession of a θήκη or shell. Both authors meant, however, by Theca the\r\nepidermal shields, but even this distinction is rendered invalid by\r\n_Carettochelys_.\r\n\r\nThe most reasonable explanation has been suggested by Hay.[131] The mosaic\r\npolygonal components of the shell of _Sphargis_ are, so to speak, an\r\nearlier generation of osteodermal plates than the later generation of\r\nlonger and broader bony plates which in the Thecophora come into contact,\r\nand fuse with, the neural arches and ribs. The osteoderms of _Sphargis_\r\nbelong to the same category as the dermal ossifications in the scutes of\r\nCrocodilia, whilst the plates of the carapace and plastron of the\r\nThecophora belong to the category of the abdominal ribs. _Sphargis_ has the\r\nfirst kind in its peculiar shell, the second kind in the deeper lying\r\nplastron and in its nuchal plate. But it has lost, or perhaps had never\r\ndeveloped, the horny shields. The only difficulty is, however, the presence\r\nof a plastron and of a typical neural plate in _Sphargis_. This difficulty\r\nis not very serious. The plastron is a very old institution. It occurs\r\ntogether with the more superficial osteoderms in _Caiman_, and the nuchal\r\nplate may be the oldest of all dorsals. We can scarcely imagine that the\r\ndirect ancestors of _Sphargis_ had developed both kinds of shells, and that\r\ncomparatively recently the inner shell of the carapace was lost, leaving\r\nonly the nuchal plate. Fossils do not support such an assumption. Undoubted\r\nancestral forms of _Sphargis_ are very rare. _Psephophorus_ of the\r\nOligocene and Miocene of Europe had a continuous mosaic shell much\r\nresembling that of _Sphargis_; _Eosphargis_ is represented by a\r\nwell-preserved skull from the London clay. Then follows a wide gap until we\r\ncome to _Psephoderma_ of the Rhaetic, or Upper Trias of Bavaria; the large\r\nfragment of whose dorsal shell is composed of about 200 mosaic pieces. If\r\nthis fragment really formed part of the shell {338}of a Chelonian, its age\r\nwould speak greatly in favour of the Athecae being a very primitive and\r\nindependent group.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. THECOPHORA.\r\n\r\n_Thoracic vertebrae and ribs united with a series of median or neural and a\r\npaired series of lateral or costal plates.

The\r\nneck, if retractile, bends in an S-shaped curve in a vertical plane. The\r\npelvis is not fused with the shell._\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. CHELYDRIDAE.–The plastron is small and cross-shaped (Fig. 61, 2,\r\np. 315); the bridge is very narrow, and the displaced abdominal shields are\r\nwidely separated from the marginals by a few irregularly shaped\r\ninframarginals. The tail is long. The limbs, neck, and head are so stout\r\nthat they cannot be completely withdrawn into the shell. Snout with a\r\npowerful hooked beak. American; only two genera, each with one species.\r\n\r\nThe temporal region is roofed very incompletely and only anteriorly by the\r\nexpanded parietals and postfrontals, which form a long suture. The plastron\r\nconsists of nine bony plates, a small entoplastron being present; there are\r\nlacunae in the middle line, the plates meeting imperfectly, and the horny\r\nabdominal shields are likewise separated by soft skin. The carapace has a\r\nnuchal with long rib-like processes which underlie the marginals; the\r\nneural plates form a continuous series. There are twenty-three marginal\r\nplates. The pubic and ischiadic symphyses remain separate, enclosing one\r\nlarge heart-shaped foramen. The five fingers and toes are webbed and are\r\nprotected by claws except the outer toe, the nail of which is usually\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\n_Chelydra serpentina_, the Snapping Turtle, attains a large size, namely, a\r\nshell-length of more than one foot, and a total length from the nose to the\r\ntip of the tail of more than three feet. Its range extends from the\r\nCanadian lakes east of the Rocky Mountains, through the United States and\r\nCentral America. The carapace of young specimens has three very marked\r\nseries of keels, which gradually disappear with age, until in very old\r\nindividuals the shell becomes quite smooth. The skin is very warty,\r\nespecially on the neck, and there is a pair of minute {339}barbels on the\r\nchin. The tail carries three series of originally triangular horny crests,\r\nwhich with age are transformed into blunt knobs. The general colour of this\r\nrather ugly creature is olive, mottled with dark brown above and with\r\nyellowish below.\r\n\r\nAccording to Holbrook the Snapping Turtle is found in stagnant pools, or in\r\nstreams where the waters are of sluggish motion. Generally they prefer deep\r\nwater, and live at the bottom of rivers; at times, however, they approach\r\nthe surface, above which they elevate the tip of their pointed snout, all\r\nother parts being concealed; and in this way they float slowly with the\r\ncurrent, but if disturbed they descend speedily to the bottom. They are\r\nextremely voracious, feeding on fish, reptiles, or any animal substance\r\nthat falls in their way. They take the hook readily, whatever may be the\r\nbait, though most attracted by pieces of fish; in this way many are caught\r\nfor the market. It is, however, necessary to have strong hooks and tackle,\r\notherwise they would be broken, for the animal puts forth great strength in\r\nhis struggles to escape, both with his firm jaws and by bringing his\r\nanterior extremities across the line. When caught they always give out an\r\nodour of musk, which in very old animals is sometimes disagreeably strong.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the Snapping Turtle leaves the water, and is seen on the banks\r\nof rivers or in meadows, even at a distance from its accustomed element. On\r\nland his motions are awkward; he walks slowly, with his head, neck, and\r\nlong tail extended, elevating himself on his legs like the Alligator, which\r\nat that time he greatly resembles in his motions; like the Alligator also,\r\nafter having walked a short distance, he falls down to rest for a few\r\nmoments, and then proceeds on his journey. In captivity they prefer dark\r\nplaces, and are exceedingly ferocious; they will seize upon and bite\r\nseverely anything that is offered them, and their grasp upon the object\r\nwith their strong jaws is most tenacious.\r\n\r\nThe Snapping Turtles, or \"Snappers,\" are feared on account of the ferocious\r\nbites which they inflict, and they are hated because of the destruction of\r\nvaluable fish and water-fowl. They in turn atone for this damage by being\r\neaten, especially the younger half-grown individuals, the flesh of the\r\nolder ones being too much tainted with the odour of musk. The round eggs,\r\nwhich are laid to the number of twenty to thirty in the summer {340}(in the\r\nNorthern States about June), are likewise good to eat. The first act of the\r\nyoung creature on leaving the shell is said to be snapping and biting. In\r\ncaptivity they are often very sulky, and refuse food stubbornly for many\r\nmonths, perhaps for a whole year, and apparently without much harm to\r\nthemselves, since they lie quietly in the distant corner of the tank, now\r\nand then slowly rising to the surface to breathe. Fresh-water algae grow on\r\nthe shell and in the mud which settles on it, and since this happens also\r\nin the wild state, they are rendered as inconspicuous as old rotten logs.\r\nIn order to attract fishes they protrude a pair of worm-like, pale pink\r\nfilaments from the tip of the tongue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.–_Macroclemmys temmincki_, \"Alligator Turtle.\" × ⅙.]\r\n\r\n_Macroclemmys temmincki_, the \"Alligator Turtle.\"–In size and general\r\nappearance much like the other Snapping Turtle, but the dorsal shields have\r\neach a strong and prominent keel, and these three series increase in size\r\nwith age. The costal shields are separated from the marginals by an\r\nadditional series of about four supramarginals, well shown in the\r\nillustration. The shields of {341}the cross-shaped plastron are subject to\r\nmuch individual variation, small shields being frequently intercalated, or\r\nrather retained, between the usual ones, especially between the pectorals\r\nand abdominals, in the gular region, and on the narrow bridge, where the\r\ninframarginals number one to three or even more. This species inhabits,\r\nbroadly speaking, the whole basin of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers.\r\n\r\nThis beast is as vicious as the other Snapping Turtle. According to Agassiz\r\nit does not withdraw its head and limbs on the approach of danger, but\r\nresorts to more active defence. It raises itself upon the legs and tail,\r\nhighest behind, opens the mouth widely, and throwing out the head quickly\r\nas far as the long neck will allow, snaps the jaws forcibly upon the\r\nassailant, at the same time throwing the body forward so powerfully as\r\noften to come down to the ground when it has missed its object.\r\n\r\nIt lives mostly in the water, but makes considerable journeys overland.\r\nBoth in the water and on dry land the limbs move nearly perpendicularly,\r\nand the body is raised high. On dry land a considerable part of the weight\r\nof the body is borne by the long, strong tail.\r\n\r\n\"They are as ferocious as the wildest beast of prey, but the slowness of\r\ntheir motions, their inability to repeat the attack immediately, their\r\nawkwardness in attempting to recover their balance when they have missed\r\ntheir object, their haggard look, and the hideous appearance of their\r\ngaping mouth, constitute at such times a picture as ludicrous as it is\r\nfearful and revolting. Their strength is truly wonderful. I have seen a\r\nlarge specimen bite off a piece of a plank more than an inch thick. They\r\ntake hold of a stick with such tenacity that they may be carried for a\r\nconsiderable distance suspended to it free above the ground. Fishes and\r\nyoung ducks are their ordinary prey. They lay from twenty to forty or more\r\nround eggs only about the size of a small walnut in holes which they dig in\r\nsloping banks not far from the water\" (Agassiz).\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. DERMATEMYDIDAE.–The pectoral shields are widely separated from the\r\nmarginals by inframarginals, the gular shields are very small or absent,\r\nand the tail is extremely short. Only two or three genera, with three or\r\nfour species in Central America.\r\n\r\nThe plastron is composed of nine plates. In _Dermatemys mawi_ it is large,\r\nfirmly joined to the carapace, covered with {342}eleven or more shields,\r\nand there are four inframarginals; in _Staurotypus salvini_ of Mexico the\r\nplastron is cruciform, with the anterior lobe movable, covered with seven\r\nor more shields, according to the fusion of the anal shields and the\r\npresence or absence of the gulars; there are only two inframarginals. The\r\npubic and ischiadic symphyses remain separate; the temporal fossa remains\r\nwidely open, the postfrontals scarcely touching the parietals. There are 23\r\nmarginal shields in _Staurotypus_, 25 in _Dermatemys_, including the\r\nunpaired nuchal. The nuchal plate has a pair of rib-like processes like\r\nthose of the Chelydridae, but some of the posterior costal plates,\r\nsometimes only one pair, meet in the middle line, overlying or suppressing\r\nthe corresponding neural plates. The shell of these aquatic tortoises is\r\nrather flat, more or less keeled, especially in young specimens, and in the\r\nfully adult condition is about one foot in length.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. CINOSTERNIDAE, represented by the single genus _Cinosternum_, with\r\nabout ten species in North and Central America, and one in Guiana. Closely\r\nallied to the two previous families, with which it agrees by the separation\r\nof the pubic and ischiadic symphyses, the presence of an ento-plastral\r\nplate, the possession of inframarginal shields (Fig. 61, 3, p. 315), the\r\nwidely open temporal fossae, and the rib-like pair of processes to the\r\nnuchal plate. It agrees with the Dermatemydidae in the interruption of the\r\nneural plates by the meeting of several pairs of the costal plates. There\r\nare 23 marginal shields; five or four shields, according to the presence or\r\nabsence of the gular on the plastron, and in some species these plastral\r\nshields become, with age, more and more separated from each other by soft\r\nskin (see Fig. 75). The shape and size of the plastron differ considerably\r\nin the various species; in most of them, e.g. in _C. pennsylvanicum_ and\r\n_C. leucostomum_, but not in _C. odoratum_, the anterior and posterior\r\nlobes are movable, with transverse soft hinges, so that the animal can\r\ncompletely close its shell. The skin of the legs and neck is so baggy and\r\nloose that these parts slip in, the skin rolling off, when the creature\r\nwithdraws into its shell. They lay only a few–from three to five–elliptical\r\neggs, which have a shining, glazed, and thick, but very brittle shell.\r\n\r\n{343}[Illustration: FIG. 75.–_Cinosternum odoratum_, young specimens.  × ⅔.\r\nA and B, males; C, female.]\r\n\r\n_Cinosternum odoratum_, the Mud-Turtle, or Stinkpot Terrapin, so called on\r\naccount of the disagreeable smell which exudes from the inguinal glands.\r\nThe head is disproportionately large, with the snout rather compressed\r\nlaterally, and pointed underneath, with several short barbels. The neck is\r\nlong and slender. The carapace of the young is keeled, each of the neural\r\nshields being raised in the middle line; but in full-grown specimens the\r\nshell becomes quite smooth and rounded. The horny shields of the plastron\r\nare relatively largest in the young, but they soon leave ever-increasing\r\nspaces between them, which are then filled with soft skin only, which\r\nthinly covers the underlying bone. The {344}fore- and hind-limbs,\r\nespecially the latter, are extensively webbed, and are provided with five\r\nshort claws. The general colour of the shell is horny brown, either uniform\r\nor with darker spots or streaks. The neck and limbs are mottled brown. The\r\nonly ornamental colouring is a pair of clear yellow broad lines on each\r\nside of the head, and a similar streak on each side of the lower jaw. On\r\nthe chin and upper throat are two pairs of small tentacles. The tail of the\r\nmale is of about the length of the hind-limbs, while that of the female is\r\nso short that its tip scarcely reaches beyond the hinder margin of the\r\ncarapace. Length of the shell of full-grown specimens between four and five\r\ninches. Very young specimens have a rather droll appearance, owing to the\r\nlong and slender neck with the large head, and the humpy back.\r\n\r\nThis species is common in the eastern half of North America, from Canada to\r\nTexas. It is mainly aquatic, and is one of the dullest and shyest species.\r\nMy own specimens spend most of their time in the water, invariably in the\r\ndarkest corners, preferably under a stone or a log, and they do not leave\r\ntheir hiding places until dark, in search of worms, meat, and all sorts of\r\nanimal food. For months I could never induce them to take food from a\r\nstick, or even to eat in my presence, and it was not until after many weeks\r\nthat one of them at last protruded its head far enough to exhibit the\r\nyellow stripes. When taken out of the water they draw in their heads, just\r\nallowing the vicious little eyes to be visible, and opening the sharp-edged\r\nmouth widely to bite deliberately and furiously at the unwary finger. Some\r\nspent the winter in the water, in the greenhouses, feeding as usual, others\r\ncrept on land, hiding under moss, half buried in the soil, where they slept\r\nfor several months, but with interruptions in order to soak and to drink.\r\nWhen spring is well advanced they prefer the water for their regular\r\nsojourn. Some which had been sent over from New York arrived in a\r\ndeplorably dried-up condition, the skin being quite flabby and shrivelled,\r\nbut after a few hours' soaking they came round, and increased considerably\r\nin weight, the limbs and neck becoming turgid.\r\n\r\n_C. pennsylvanicum_ of Eastern North America has a larger, more oval\r\nplastron. The head is not so strikingly large as in the other species and,\r\nlike the neck, is brown with yellowish spots, and often has streaks on the\r\nsides. The tail of the male ends in a {345}nail-like horny point. The lobes\r\nof the plastron are well hinged in the adult.\r\n\r\n_C. leucostomum_ of Central America is larger, with a shell-length of six\r\ninches. The plastron is not at all cruciform, but has a broad bridge, and\r\nfills the box, moreover it has an anterior and a posterior hinge, so that\r\nthe box can be completely closed. Hence the vernacular name of the\r\nBox-Terrapin.\r\n\r\nFAM. 4. PLATYSTERNIDAE, represented by the single species _Platysternum\r\nmegacephalum_ in Burma, Siam, and Southern China.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral shields are widely separated from the marginals by\r\ninframarginals, the plastron is large, oblong, not cruciform, and the tail\r\nis long.\r\n\r\nThe plastron consists of nine plates, and is covered with six pairs of\r\nshields, the most anterior of which are the broad gulars. The nuchal plate\r\nhas no rib-like processes. The neurals form a continuous series, and there\r\nare twenty-three marginal scutes. The temporal fossae are completely roofed\r\nover, owing to the long sutures formed by the parietals with the\r\npostfrontals, moreover the postfrontals expand laterally so much that they\r\nposteriorly come into broad contact with the quadrato-jugals and\r\nsquamosals, anteriorly with the maxillaries, so that the jugals are\r\ncompletely surrounded by bones, and are shut off from the orbits and from\r\nthe temporal fossae. This is a unique arrangement, found nowhere else in\r\nTortoises. The pubic and ischiadic symphyses are connected with each other\r\nby ligaments only.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of this water-tortoise is rather curious, since the\r\ncarapace is much depressed, looking, especially in younger specimens, as if\r\nit had been crushed in. The head, provided with very strong hooked jaws, is\r\nstrikingly heavy and large, and is covered above with one single large\r\nshield. The tail is longer than the shell, which, in full-grown specimens,\r\nreaches about six inches in length; it is, throughout its length, covered\r\nwith rings of squarish shields. A large specimen measures 14 inches in\r\ntotal length, of which only five fall to the shell.\r\n\r\nFAM. 5. TESTUDINIDAE.–The shell is always covered with well-developed horny\r\nshields. Those which form the plastral bridge are in direct contact with\r\nthe marginals. The plastron is composed of nine bones. The digits have four\r\nor five claws. The neck is completely retractile. The skull is devoid of\r\nparieto-squamosal arches.\r\n\r\n{346}This large family is cosmopolitan, with the exception of the\r\nAustralian and the adjoining Austro-Malayan countries. It contains genera\r\nwhich form a continuous gradation between absolutely terrestrial and\r\nthoroughly aquatic tortoises; and many are truly amphibious. As a general\r\nrule the typically terrestrial kinds have a more curved or arched shell,\r\nthe digits are short, the eggs are more oval or round, and they are chiefly\r\nherbivorous; the essentially aquatic kinds have a flatter or depressed\r\nshell, webbed feet, with longer, often slender claws, the eggs are more\r\ncylindrical, and they live on animal diet. About 20 genera, with more than\r\n110 species, are recognised by Boulenger, but their essential characters\r\nare nearly all internal, and therefore of no avail for the determination of\r\nlive or entire specimens.\r\n\r\n_Chrysemys._–One of the most typical and widely distributed genera of\r\nAmerican Terrapins or water-tortoises. The carapace is flat; the plastron\r\nis quite immovable, with a strongly developed bridge. Feet well webbed.\r\nTail short. Skull with a broad, complete, lateral, temporal arch. About one\r\ndozen species, mostly in the eastern half of the United States, but the\r\nwhole genus ranges from Canada to Argentina.\r\n\r\nMost of the young _Chrysemys_ are very pretty, the ground-colour of the\r\nupper shields being green, variegated with yellowish-brown or blackish\r\nmarkings, which often form exquisitely delicate patterns, either\r\nconcentrical (_Ch. concinna_, _Ch. rubriventris_), or more longitudinal\r\n(_Ch. elegans_), or apparently quite irregular. The ground-colour of the\r\nplastron is yellow, but the various species are best distinguished, at\r\nleast in very young individuals, by the arrangement of the dark brown spots\r\nand patches. There are, for instance, several pairs of bold lateral and\r\nseveral median patches in _Ch. rubriventris_; five pairs of ocellated spots\r\nin _Ch. elegans_; only small median patches, where four plastral shields\r\nmeet, in _Ch. concinna_; while the plastron of _Ch. picta_ is uniformly\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nThese water-tortoises are very lively and shy, most so perhaps _Ch. picta_,\r\nwhich is very quick and active. The food varies, often according to\r\nindividual fancy. Most of them eat fish. _Ch. picta_ is partial to insects,\r\nbut it also takes worms. Some of my specimens refused meat for a long time,\r\nbut ultimately they became so fond of it and of worms, that they came out\r\nof the pond to take the food from the fingers; those in the Zoological\r\n{347}Gardens of London have developed a taste for biscuits. One of my\r\nlargest _Ch. concinna_ fasted deliberately for eight months, refusing\r\nworms, insects, meat, and frogs, only occasionally sniffing at the food,\r\nuntil it was tempted with whitebait, which it took greedily. It refused,\r\nhowever, smelts and pieces of soles, but after another month it\r\ncondescended to take meat regularly. Very young individuals live chiefly on\r\nflies, which they watch for near the surface of the water; and they are\r\nfond of smooth caterpillars, maggots, the larvae of humble-bees, and\r\nsimilar soft creatures. They all spend most of their time in the water,\r\npreferably floating near the surface, hidden between weeds; and they are\r\nfond of basking. Some of them spend the night in the water, lying\r\nmotionless on the bottom, with heads and limbs turned in. Others prefer\r\nhiding under moss. Those species, which, like _Ch. concinna_ and _Ch.\r\npicta_, are common in the North, are of course perfectly hardy. For the\r\nwinter they dig themselves holes in the banks near the water, and they do\r\nnot come out again until the spring is well advanced. The eggs are\r\nhard-shelled, mostly long and oval, and they are hatched before the end of\r\nthe summer. The larger species of Terrapin are eaten.\r\n\r\n_Ch. picta_ (Fig. 76), the \"Painted Terrapin,\" of the Eastern United\r\nStates, _e.g._ of New York and Long Island, is easily recognised by the\r\nmuch depressed shell, which is absolutely smooth, and without a trace of a\r\nkeel. The colour above is dark olive-brown or blackish, with broad yellow\r\nbands across the anterior ends of the neural and costal shields. Three or\r\nfour of these transverse bands are very conspicuous. The marginals are red,\r\nwith more or less concentric black and yellow markings. The pretty red\r\ncolour, with some black stripes, extends over the bridge, but the plastron\r\nitself is uniformly yellow. The soft parts are likewise prettily marked,\r\nthe ground-colour is black-brown, with delicate bright yellow and red\r\nstripes on the sides of the neck, limbs, and tail. The stripes are\r\noriginally yellow, but they develop an orange or red line in the middle, so\r\nthat each red stripe is ultimately narrowly edged with yellow; or the\r\nyellow and red stripes alternate, for instance on the tail, which is short,\r\nnarrow, and pointed. The head is further adorned with a pair of conspicuous\r\nbright yellow patches behind the eyes, and a smaller pair on the occiput.\r\nThe black and yellow stripes run across the gape of the mouth, some of the\r\nlines even looking as if they had been {348}painted across. The nuchal\r\nshield is elongated and very narrow, its anterior edge and that of the\r\nneighbouring marginals are finely serrated. Very young individuals are at\r\nonce recognised by the prominent longitudinal median stripe of bright\r\norange extending over the nuchal and neural shields; the yellow transverse\r\nbands are still absent; they appear when the longitudinal line vanishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.–_Chrysemys picta_, \"Painted Terrapin.\" × ½.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Painted Terrapin\" is one of the few species of which, thanks to L.\r\nAgassiz,[132] complete data of growth from the new born to old age are\r\nknown. During the first six or seven years the rate of growth is so uniform\r\nthat numerous specimens collected at the same time are readily arranged in\r\nsets of the same age, simply by the differences they show in their size.\r\nThe successive lines of growth on the shields indicate the number of years.\r\nAfter the seventh year the age is much more difficult to distinguish in\r\nthose tortoises, which, like _Ch. picta_, have a perfectly smooth\r\nepidermis. This smoothness is due to the fact that the shields undergo a\r\nprocess of moulting. An upper, quite {349}transparent layer of each shield\r\npeels off completely like a piece of mica. I have been able to confirm\r\nAgassiz' statement on _Ch. concinna_ in their third and fourth springs, and\r\non a number of adult _Ch. picta_. The latter were not allowed to hibernate,\r\nbeing kept in a warm tank; they peeled completely during the late autumn,\r\nand then the red and yellow colours underlying the newly formed shields\r\nappeared very vividly; others moult at midsummer.\r\n\r\nGrowth of _Ch. picta_, after Agassiz.\r\n\r\n  +––––––––––––––––––––––+––––––––––-+––––––––––––+––––––––––-+––––––––––-+\r\n  |        Year.         | Length of | Breadth of | Height of | Length of |\r\n  |                      | carapace. | carapace.  |    box.   |   tail.   |\r\n  +––––––––––––––––––––––+––––––––––-+––––––––––––+––––––––––-+––––––––––-+\r\n  |                      |  millim.  |  millim.   |  millim.  |  millim.  |\r\n  | Second               |    26.5   |    25      |    12     |    16.5   |\r\n  | Third                |    42     |    39.5    |    17     |    17.5   |\r\n  | Fourth               |    51     |    49      |    21.5   |    20.5   |\r\n  | Fifth                |    54     |    51      |    23.5   |    21.5   |\r\n  | Sixth                |    59     |    56      |    25     |    23.5   |\r\n  | Seventh              |    66     |    60      |    26.5   |    26     |\r\n  | Eighth (♂)           |    72.5   |    61      |    28     |    27.5   |\r\n  | Ninth (♂)            |    74     |    62      |    28     |    27.5   |\r\n  | Tenth (♂)            |    77     |    64      |    30     |    28     |\r\n  | Eleventh (♂)         |    80     |    67      |    30     |    28.5   |\r\n  | Fourteenth (♂)       |    92     |    74.5    |    33     |    28.5   |\r\n  | Twenty-fifth (♀)     |   121     |    92      |    43     |    34     |\r\n  | Old ♀                |   129     |    96      |    47     |    37     |\r\n  | Very old ♀           |   163     |   113      |    59     |    53     |\r\n  +––––––––––––––––––––––+––––––––––-+––––––––––––+––––––––––-+––––––––––-+\r\n\r\nThe size of the eggs varies considerably, from 26 by 17 to 30 by 16\r\nmillimeters; sometimes they are perfectly round, 17 mm. in diameter.\r\n\r\n_Ch. concinna._–The specific character by which this Terrapin may be easily\r\nrecognised is a pair of orange-red broad streaks, which extend from above\r\nthe eye to the sides of the neck. The general colour is olive-brown above,\r\nvariegated with yellowish dark-edged lines, which, together with numerous\r\nrugosities, radiate from the middle field of each shield. The plastron is\r\nyellow, often with blackish symmetrical patches, and sometimes these become\r\nconfluent and preponderant. Very young specimens are extremely pretty, the\r\nground-colour of the carapace being green, each shield with darker,\r\nsomewhat concentric markings, most conspicuous and regular on the upper\r\nsurface of the marginals, where the marks of the adjoining shields form one\r\npattern-system across the dividing lines. The plastron is either uniform\r\nyellow or has a few pairs of blackish spots {350}which stand so closely\r\ntogether that they form almost median patches.\r\n\r\nThe carapace is rough. The horny shields become very thin with age. The\r\nanterior margin of the small nuchal and the neighbouring marginals is\r\nfaintly serrated. The posterior marginals form slight notches or\r\nindentations between their edges. The plastron is almost square behind. The\r\nedges of the jaws are nearly smooth, without hook and receiving-notch. The\r\ntail is short.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.–_Chrysemys concinna_, in its third summer, × 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.–_Chrysemys concinna_, in its third summer, × 1.]\r\n\r\nThis species inhabits the South-Eastern States of North America, from\r\nMissouri and North Carolina to the Gulf of Mexico. Very large female\r\nspecimens have a shell sixteen inches in length. The eggs measure from 33\r\nby 25 to 39 by 25 mm. or about 1½ inch in the long diameter.\r\n\r\n_Emys._–The plastron is movably united to the carapace by ligament, and in\r\nthe adult has a slightly flexible hinge across the middle, between the hyo-\r\nand hypo-plastral plates and the pectoral and abdominal shields. The\r\nplastron is large, but does not quite close the box. Besides the small\r\nnuchal there are twelve pairs {351}of marginal shields. The head is covered\r\nwith smooth skin; the temporal arch is complete. The limbs are extensively\r\nwebbed. The tail of the very young is nearly as long as the shell, but it\r\nbecomes relatively shorter with age, being reduced in the males to about\r\ntwo-thirds, in the females to half the length of the shell. Only two\r\nspecies are found in Europe, the other, _E. blandingi_, in Canada and\r\nnorth-eastern U.S.A.\r\n\r\n_E. orbicularis_ s. _europaea_ s. _lutaria_, the European\r\nPond-tortoise.–The shape and coloration of the shell change likewise much\r\nwith age. In the very young the shell is round, and the shields are rough\r\nand slightly keeled, uniform dark brown above, black below, with a yellow\r\nspot on each marginal and plastral shield. When half grown the dorsal\r\nshields become quite smooth, and are striated or spotted, with yellow upon\r\na dark ground. The head, limbs, and tail are dark, with yellow or light\r\nbrown spots and small dots. In very old specimens all these yellow marks\r\ndisappear on the shell, which then becomes uniform brown or almost black.\r\nThe coloration is subject to much local and individual variation, and there\r\nare two main types, the spotted and the radiate. It is difficult to say\r\nwhich of the two is the prettier. One male which I caught in the Alemtejo\r\nwas very beautiful. The shell was almost black with a greenish shine when\r\nin the water, and had many bright yellow and whitish spots. In the radiate\r\ntype the yellow is sometimes preponderant, so that each shield becomes a\r\nstudy of delicately painted yellow, brown, and blackish lines radiating\r\nfrom the centre. This variety seems to prevail in the south of Spain,\r\ndecidedly so in the Marismas, also in Northern Italy, whence most of the\r\nEuropean markets are supplied. The largest shell in the British Museum is\r\n19 cm. = 7½ inches long. Fischer Sigwart received one from Naples which was\r\nabout 9 inches long, and this seems to have been kept as a pet, since its\r\nshell had been gilt. Specimens about 5 inches in length may be considered\r\nas fully adult. There are very few reliable observations on the growth of\r\nindividuals. One of F. Sigwart's grew in eleven years only about 2.5 cm. =\r\n1 inch, when its shell was 13.4 cm. = 5¼ inches long–total weight of the\r\ntortoise 491 grammes, about 1 lb. One of my own grew from 11 to 13.2 cm.\r\nshell-length, and 8.3 to 10.6 cm. in width within eight years, but this was\r\none of the specimens which, living in a greenhouse, {352}did not hibernate.\r\nThis European pond-tortoise is now restricted to Southern and Middle\r\nEurope, extending eastwards towards St. Petersburg and into Asia Minor,\r\nsouthwards into Algeria. Formerly it had a much wider range, having been\r\nfound in post-glacial deposits in Southern Sweden, Denmark, the\r\nNetherlands, and in East Anglia. Specimens have been found in the peat of\r\nthe fens of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, contemporary with bones of the\r\nBeaver, Roe-deer, and Pelican. The same applies to North Germany, where its\r\ngradual disappearance from the western and central parts is obvious. Except\r\nin Central France it is now practically unknown to the west of the Elbe\r\nriver. The country between the Elbe and Oder is now debatable ground,\r\n_Emys_ being exceedingly rare. Some fifty years ago this seems to have been\r\ndifferent, to judge from the fact that farmers were rather fond of keeping\r\na tortoise in the water-troughs of the cattle to keep the water free from\r\nworms and other impurities. Hence arose a silly superstitious custom. It\r\nwas considered equally conducive to the health of the pigs to keep a\r\ntortoise in the foul tub into which all the dish-water and\r\nkitchen-refuse–as potato-peels, sour milk, etc.,–were collected before the\r\nmess was given to the pigs.\r\n\r\nA specimen is still occasionally caught in the Havel and Spree rivers. I\r\nmyself have heard of one or two in the backwaters of the Oder near\r\nFrankfurt, but they are vanishing, and it is difficult to say exactly why.\r\nThe universal lowering of the water-level owing to better drainage cannot\r\nquite account for it, since there are thousands of suitable ponds, swamps,\r\nand backwaters left. In Poland and in Eastern Prussia the tortoise is still\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nThis creature lives on a strictly animal diet. Worms, insects, frogs,\r\nfishes form its main sustenance. Fishes are regularly stalked. The tortoise\r\nwatches its opportunity, slowly it half crawls, half swims along the\r\nbottom, rises imperceptibly by a few gentle movements of the widely\r\nspread-out webbed feet, then opens its sharp cutting jaws wide, and makes a\r\ngrab at the belly of the fish. Frogs are most easily stalked when they sit\r\nupon a floating leaf. The tortoise rises from below, and often waits with\r\nthe nostrils and eyes just above the water and close to the frog. After a\r\nwhile it sinks, and rises again, this time actually touching the toes of\r\nthe non-suspecting frog, smelling at them and deliberately biting with a\r\nsideward turn of the head.\r\n\r\n{353}[Illustration: FIG. 79.–_Emys orbicularis_, European Pond-tortoise\r\n(left), and _Clemmys leprosa_, Iberian Water-tortoise (right). × ½.]\r\n\r\n{354}What the jaws have got hold of is not allowed to escape again. The\r\ntortoise holds on and tears the prey to pieces with the sharp-clawed\r\nfingers. This takes a long time, only the scraped-off flesh and the\r\nintestines being eaten. The skeleton remains and sinks to the bottom, while\r\nin the case of a fish, the air-bladder floats away on the surface, and\r\nremains there as one of the surest signs of the existence of tortoises in\r\nthat locality. The bones are cleaned with wonderful neatness. Some of my\r\ngrass-snakes shared this fate, their backbones, with the hundreds of pairs\r\nof ribs, being picked or rather scraped clean, scarcely less well than if\r\nthey had been prepared for a museum.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the prey must be in motion to be seized, unless the tortoise has\r\nwatched it before, and even then the latter prefers to smell it before\r\nbiting. In captivity they soon learn to eat meat, and they become very\r\ntame, but in their native haunts they are extremely shy and cautious. Fond\r\nof basking upon a stone or on the banks, with the four limbs sprawling, or\r\nwith the hind-limbs stretched backwards, and with the webs spread out so as\r\nto offer as large a surface as possible to the rays of the sun, they lie\r\nmotionless for hours and appear fast asleep. But the slightest noise, or\r\nany other sign of our approach, is sufficient to send them plumping into\r\nthe water, and to make them scuttle along with unsuspected agility. Nothing\r\nbut the audible plump of the flat body and the widening rings of the\r\ndisturbed water indicate their presence. After a long time of waiting we\r\ngive it up, and turn away. That very instant we see a little ripple, caused\r\nby the withdrawing of the tortoise, which had come to the surface and had\r\nbeen watching us, with only the nose and eyes peeping out of the water, the\r\nrest being concealed between the floating vegetation. Apparently they\r\ncannot see us well with their eyes still under water, owing to the\r\ndifference of refraction, otherwise they would not peep out and then at\r\nonce turn back. It is certainly not for the want of air, since they can\r\nremain below for many hours without breathing.\r\n\r\nAlthough they generally feed in the water, they come on land when tame and\r\nhungry enough to take the offered food. Sometimes they make long\r\nmigrations, perhaps because their old home is dried up or does not yield\r\nfood enough. They hibernate during the cold season, buried in the mud, and\r\nthey do not appear until {355}the spring is well advanced. During the\r\npairing season, on warm spring nights, they emit short piping sounds, and\r\nwhen they have found each other, the couple swim about together. The white,\r\nhard-shelled, long, oval eggs, averaging 25 to 15 mm., and about ten in\r\nnumber, are laid on land. This is a very laborious and curious business.\r\nThe female having selected a suitable spot, not loose sand, but rather hard\r\nsoil free from grass and other dense vegetation, prepares the ground by\r\nmoistening it from the bladder and the anal water-sacs. Then it stiffens\r\nthe tail and bores a hole with it, moving the tail but not the body. The\r\nhind-limbs then scoop out the hole, the broad feet moving alternately and\r\nheaping up the soil on the side, until the hole is about five inches deep,\r\nthat is as far as the hind legs will reach. The eggs are laid at the bottom\r\nin one layer, divided and distributed by the feet. Lastly, the soil is put\r\nin again, and the tortoise, by repeatedly raising its body and falling\r\ndown, stamps the soil firm and flat, roughens the surface a little with its\r\nclaws, and leaves the nest to its fate. Nothing but an accident leads to\r\nits discovery. The young are hatched, according to locality and the kind of\r\nseason, either in the same autumn or not until the next spring. Eggs laid\r\nin a garden at Kieff, in Russia, were hatched eleven months later. This\r\nimplies hibernation of the embryo within the egg, and this is probably the\r\nusual course of events, resembling the conditions of the development of\r\n_Sphenodon_ (cf. p. 299). The pretty little creatures, scarcely larger than\r\na shilling-piece, are exceedingly difficult to rear. They require a tank\r\nwith green vegetation, stones to bask on and to hide under, and also dry\r\nground and moss for a change. They eat flies, tiny worms, tadpoles, etc.,\r\ngreedily enough, but for some occult reasons they do less well than many\r\nanother kind of water-tortoise. Miss Durham has, however, succeeded in\r\nrearing one, which is now in its fourth year; the shell is 2 inches long,\r\nand each shield shows three annual rings around the areola. This specimen\r\nspent the winters in an unheated room under moss, not in the water.\r\n\r\n_E. blandingi_, the North American species, has a more elongated and\r\ndecidedly higher carapace than its smaller European relation. The carapace\r\nis dull black with many pale yellowish spots; the plastron is yellow, with\r\na large dark patch on the outer and hinder corner of each shield. The head\r\nis dark brown above, bright {356}yellow below and on the throat, a contrast\r\nwhich gives this tortoise a striking appearance. This species is extremely\r\nvoracious, becomes easily tame, and spends a great part of the day on land,\r\nhiding under grass to avoid great heat, and withdrawing into the water for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n_Clemmys._–The plastron is immovably united with the carapace, and is\r\ndevoid of any transverse hinge. The skull has a complete bony temporal\r\narch. This genus, consisting of eight species, is otherwise very much like\r\n_Emys_, and is truly Periarctic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.–Skull of _Clemmys leprosa_. × 3/2. _A_, dorsal\r\nview; _B_, from the left side; _F_, frontal; _J_, jugal; _M_, maxillary;\r\n_Par_, parietal; _Pr.f_, prefrontal; _Pt.f_, postfrontal; _Q_, quadrate;\r\n_Qj_, quadrato-jugal; _Sq_, squamosal.]\r\n\r\n_C. leprosa_ s. _sigris_ (Fig. 79).–The upper jaw has a median notch for\r\nthe reception of the upturned point of the lower jaw; the cutting edges of\r\nthe powerful beak are smooth. The shell is flat and long-oval, nowhere\r\nserrated. The plastron does not quite fill the box. In the young the shell\r\nis nearly round, and the horny shields form three series of keels, of which\r\nthe lateral pair disappear early; the shields are olive-brown, each with an\r\norange spot or streak; the plastron is dark brown, with a yellowish margin.\r\nThe adult looks very different. The shell has become much more oval, with\r\nthe greatest width behind the bridge. The long shields are smooth, and in\r\nelderly specimens are without any trace of the original connective rings of\r\ngrowth. The general colour of the shell is uniform pale olive-grey,\r\ninclining to yellow on the plastron. The ground-colour of the soft parts is\r\nolive-grey, but the sides of the head are adorned with orange-red or yellow\r\nmarks, the patch between the eye and ear and three or {357}four stripes on\r\nthe neck being especially conspicuous. The limbs have pale yellowish\r\nstreaks. All these markings are, however, subject to much individual\r\nvariation. While, for instance, the half-grown creatures are distinctly\r\nagreeably coloured, often with a rich brown, nicely sculptured shell, and\r\nwith conspicuous orange and yellow marks on the skin, the very old ones\r\nbecome rather ugly, the prevailing colour varying more and more into dull\r\nuniform pale olive-grey.\r\n\r\nThe \"Iberian Water-tortoise\" is typical of the Iberian Peninsula, and\r\nextends through Morocco and Algeria far into North-Western Africa. Unknown\r\nto the north of the Cantabrian range, decidedly scarcer than its cousin\r\n_Emys_ in the northern half of the Peninsula, it becomes common in the\r\nsouth. In the Alemtejo, in the lower parts of Andalucia and in Morocco,\r\nthere is scarcely a pool, stream, or river in which it is not found,\r\nfeeding on any living thing it can master, although fishes and frogs are\r\nits principal prey. When the streams and watercourses run dry, during the\r\nhot and dry season, the tortoises crowd together into the remaining pools,\r\nwhich soon become stagnant and filthy. But even these havens of refuge are\r\nnot of lasting avail. They are soon cleared of anything edible, and the\r\nstinking water becomes dirtier and hotter day by day. Ultimately the\r\ntortoises leave the pool to hide under ledges of rocks, where they\r\naestivate for months. This life in the muddy, slimy pools renders these\r\ntortoises peculiarly liable to the attacks of a certain fresh-water alga,\r\nwhich enters through the cracks in the horny shields and then flourishes in\r\nthe Malpighian layer, and even in the underlying bone itself. This becomes\r\ngangrenous in patches, and the whole shell assumes a leprous appearance,\r\nhence the specific name of _leprosa_. Everything combines in favour of this\r\ndestructive little alga. The tortoise, covered with mud, basks in the hot\r\nsun, the horny shields become brittle and crack, often peeling off in thin\r\nflakes. But those happy individuals which inhabit permanent rivers, or\r\npools which do not dry up, are, and remain, as clean as other\r\nwater-tortoises.\r\n\r\n_C. leprosa_ has a most disagreeable, offensive smell, something like\r\nconcentrated essence of fish, due to the secretion of a pair of large\r\nglands situated beneath the skin of the inguinal region, and opening behind\r\nthe bridge. Freshly caught specimens stink horribly, but when they have\r\nbecome accustomed to being {358}handled, they no longer void these glands.\r\nThey always withdraw into the water for the night, and the cold season is\r\nspent in the mud. Their time of propagation is still somewhat doubtful.\r\nVery young tortoises are met with in the Peninsula in March, when they are\r\nalready in the rivers. Those which I imported in the summer and autumn\r\ninvariably dug their nests and laid their long, oval eggs (28 to 33 mm.\r\nlong) in the month of November, pairing having taken place some two or\r\nthree months previously. The mode of making the nest is exactly the same as\r\nthat described for _Emys_. As most of my specimens were kept in a\r\ngreenhouse with a permanent current of warm water through their tanks, they\r\nnever hibernated, nor did they pass through a torpid time in the summer,\r\nbut they showed an irresistible love for the hot-water pipes, huddling\r\ntogether by the dozen, so that the pipes had to be screened off to prevent\r\nthe creatures from getting burnt. Until this precaution was taken, they\r\nheated themselves so much that the shields and even the bones of the\r\nplastron were injured. The artificial warm temperature and the complete\r\nsuppression of seasonal rest had no bad influence, most of the tortoises\r\nliving with undiminished appetite for more than twelve years, but the\r\nsexual period became disturbed, pairing occurring ultimately at all times\r\nof the year. The eagerness of the males, however, had a peculiar evil\r\nsecondary influence upon the females. The male tries to fasten on to its\r\nmate by biting into the collar-like fold of the neck into which the head is\r\nwithdrawn, and this repeated irritation produces sores and swellings, which\r\nlatter in their turn prevent the female from wiping the eyes with the back\r\nof the fore-limbs, a habit common to most, if not all, tortoises.\r\nUltimately the eyes fester, and the tortoise, becoming practically blind,\r\nfalls off its feed, leaves the water, which makes matters worse, and is\r\nvery difficult to cure.\r\n\r\nIn other respects they are very hardy, and they stand acclimatisation in\r\nEngland perfectly. Some, thriving in a deep concreted pond, passed through\r\nthe very severe winters of several years ago, hiding in the mud below the\r\nice, and appeared in the spring in perfect health. They can also\r\nsuccessfully pass the winter under moss and a heap of loose garden-rubbish.\r\n\r\n_C. caspica_ is closely allied to _C. leprosa_, which it represents in the\r\nBalkan Peninsula and in Asia Minor. It differs from the south-western\r\nspecies chiefly by having the cutting edges of the {359}upper jaw finely\r\ndenticulated, and by its prettier coloration, each shield being ornamented\r\nwith yellowish streaks which form a kind of ∞ on the costals, and a ring on\r\nthe marginals. The plastron is black in the young, with yellow and black\r\npatches in the adult. The head and sides of the neck are striped with\r\nyellow lines, narrowly edged with black, and the rest of the soft parts is\r\nmarbled dark olive and yellow. A few other species occur in China, Japan,\r\nand North America.\r\n\r\n_Clemmys insculpta_, one of the American species, ranging from Maine to\r\nPennsylvania and New Jersey, is easily recognised by the peculiar\r\nreddish-brown and brick-dust colour of the soft parts. The strongly keeled,\r\nposteriorly emarginate carapace is reddish brown, with radiating yellow\r\nlines. Each shield is delicately sculptured. The plastron, which is notched\r\nbehind, is yellow, with a large black patch on the outer corner of each\r\nshield. Length of a full-grown specimen 8 inches. They frequent the rivers\r\nand ponds, but are also very fond of leaving the water, sometimes remaining\r\nfor months in dry places.\r\n\r\n_Malacoclemmys_ of North America, with three species only, is closely\r\nallied to _Clemmys_, from which it differs chiefly by the very broad\r\nalveolar surface of the upper jaw, and by the more forward position of the\r\nentoplastron, this being placed anteriorly to the humero-pectoral suture.\r\nWe mention this genus since one of its species, _M. terrapin_, is so\r\nextensively eaten in the Eastern United States. The shell is oval, slightly\r\nemarginate behind, obtusely carinated along the middle line. The upper\r\nparts of the shell are brown or greenish, with dark concentric lines; the\r\nmarginals are yellow below, each with a ring of dark grey, and forming a\r\npeculiarly up-turned rim. The plastron is yellowish, either with concentric\r\nstripes and dusky lines or uniform yellow. But it is the colour of the soft\r\nparts which gives this otherwise dull-looking creature its delicately\r\npretty appearance. The skin is, namely, greenish white with countless small\r\nblack dots. The males remain much smaller than the females, and have the\r\nconcentric stripes more pronounced. This species, the choicest of the\r\nedible Terrapins, frequents the salt marshes of the east coast of North\r\nAmerica, from Rhode Island to the Gulf of Mexico, being most abundant\r\naround Charleston.\r\n\r\nThe following is a condensed account of an article which appeared in the\r\nNew York Sun, 18th September 1898, the data {360}of which were supplied by\r\nthe manager of the terrapin-farm at Beaulieu, Georgia. The continued\r\nhunting and the unfailing demand for them are making them very scarce, so\r\nthat enterprising men have established terrapin-farms or \"crawls\" for the\r\nkeeping and breeding of terrapins. The \"crawls\" in question are near the\r\nriver. The larger is 310 by 60 feet, and is divided into three compartments\r\nfor three sizes. The smaller \"crawl\" is for the babies, and is 100 by 8\r\nfeet. Through both \"crawls\" runs a ditch connected with the river and\r\nmaking a circuit of the farm. The bottom of the \"crawls\" is on a level with\r\nthe low tide, and is covered with a layer of mud about six inches deep.\r\nInto this the terrapins burrow in the winter. The average population of\r\nterrapins is about 40,000, one half \"bulls\" and the other half \"heifers.\"\r\nThe latter are much better eating, and grow to a much larger size, namely,\r\neight inches on the plastron, while the \"bulls\" rarely grow over five\r\ninches long. When a female reaches six to eight inches it is called a\r\n\"count.\" Those between five-and-a-half to six inches long are known as\r\n\"two-for-threes,\" while those from five to five-and-a-half inches are known\r\nas \"halves.\" They are fed exclusively on shrimps and crabs on account of\r\nthe flavour, although they will eat almost anything. The 40,000 consume on\r\nan average twenty bushels of crustaceans a day. They are quite indifferent\r\nto cold. The manager saw some placed in a block of ice and frozen fast to\r\nit; after four or five days they were chopped out, thawed, and were soon as\r\nlively as ever. The statement that it takes these terrapins only seven\r\nyears to attain full commercial growth is surprising, and is probably an\r\nunderestimate. At the end of the large \"crawl\" is a board to enable the\r\nfemales to creep into a sand-pit, where they lay the eggs from April to\r\nJune, eight to twelve forming a set. It is necessary to get the babies away\r\nfrom their parents as soon as they hatch, else they will be eaten. The\r\nyoung must not be exposed to the cold. The old ones have a large amount of\r\ncuriosity. The best way of catching them is for two men to go out in a boat\r\nwith a net. They row carefully along until they come to a likely spot. Then\r\none man raps several times sharply on the boat with a stick, and if there\r\nare any terrapin about they will come to the surface just as fast as they\r\ncan get there to see what is going on, and the other man scoops them up\r\nwith a little net. Another {361}way, used in the salt marshes, is for the\r\nnegroes to go tramping through the mud and water. If they pass any terrapin\r\nthese will rise out of the mud to see what the disturbance is. The captives\r\nare then fattened in the \"crawl.\" When the men go in to feed them they\r\nwhistle, and terrapin from all over the \"crawl,\" thousands of them, come\r\nswimming through the water, piling over each other in their efforts to get\r\nclose to the man with the shrimps and crabs.\r\n\r\n_Cistudo._–The plastron, without forming a bridge, is connected with the\r\ncarapace by ligaments, and is divided into two movable lobes, the\r\ntransverse hinge being so perfect that the box can be completely closed\r\nafter head, legs, and tail have been withdrawn. The nuchal shield is very\r\nsmall; the first four neurals are large and broad, the fifth much broader\r\nthan long. There are twelve pairs of marginal shields. The carapace is high\r\nand arched. The digits are almost completely free. The tail is very short.\r\nThe skull is without a bony temporal arch, the quadrato-jugal and the jugal\r\nbeing absent. Only two species, in North America.\r\n\r\n_C. carolina_ of the Eastern United States is a very interesting species.\r\nClosely allied by its internal structure to the water-tortoises, it has\r\nbecome absolutely terrestrial; and the shape of the head, the convex shell\r\nwhich is coloured black and yellow or orange-brown, and the short webless\r\nfingers are all terrestrial features. But the rather long toes, provided\r\nwith long and sharp claws, the broad and flat feet, enlarged by a broad\r\nfold of skin on the outer margin, the long oval eggs, the smooth covering\r\nof the head, and the preponderant animal diet, still proclaim the aquatic\r\nrelationship of this tortoise. It is in fact a genus which has changed\r\nhabits and features from aquatic to terrestrial life. The head is covered\r\nwith a smooth skin, and the upper beak, especially in old specimens, is\r\nstrongly and broadly hooked. The eyes of the males are red, those of the\r\nfemales are brown. The plastron of the males is concave, that of the\r\nfemales is flat. Large females reach a length of nearly six inches. The\r\nyoung are nearly round, with high, arched back and prominent keels. The\r\nkeels of the middle line remain a long time, but they gradually flatten\r\ndown with age, being prominent only at their posterior ends. Each dorsal\r\nshield is originally nicely sculptured, with a well-marked areola and\r\nconcentric rings. Very old individuals {362}become much flatter on the top\r\nof the shell, but the sides remain steep, so that the whole shell roughly\r\nresembles a somewhat oblong box with the corners rounded off, and the whole\r\nupper surface rubbed down quite smooth. The variations of colour are almost\r\nendless, and they occur in the same localities. I have a number of all ages\r\nfrom Long Island, near New York. The half-grown are beautifully reddish or\r\norange-brown with dark patches, median keels prominent, plastron uniform\r\nblack-brown. In others the dark-brown prevails over the lighter markings,\r\nwhich are yellower and more spotted or dotted than patched. Some of the\r\noldest, with quite smooth shells, are black, with small, round, light\r\nyellow spots. Others are vermiculated or striped with yellow and black. The\r\nsoft parts vary to the same extent, some showing on the neck a beautiful\r\nintricate pattern of yellow, reddish and brown, while in others these\r\ncolours are arranged more or less in longitudinal stripes.\r\n\r\nThese \"Box-tortoises\" are often caught in the States and kept as pets in\r\nthe gardens, and their owners mark them by cutting their initials into the\r\nplastron. These marks heal up and widen in time like letters cut into the\r\nbark of a tree. One of my specimens, certainly a very old one to judge from\r\nhis hooked beak, perfectly smooth and flat shell, and from the condition of\r\nthe marginals, which have the edges rubbed down quite smooth and rounded\r\noff, has two initials and the date 1837 on its plastron. Of course there is\r\nno proof that the date had been cut in that year, more than sixty-three\r\nyears ago, but it was done a long time ago. The scars on those parts of the\r\nshell which touch the ground are almost effaced, and the letters and\r\nfigures have become somewhat distorted owing to the usual unequal, not\r\nconcentrical, peripheral growth. Moreover, this tortoise must have been\r\nalready adult, although not quite fully grown, since the marks are large\r\nand were evidently put in such a size and position as to fit the available\r\nspace. I may mention that this record tortoise was, when I got it, not kept\r\nin confinement, but had been picked up at large.\r\n\r\nThese Box-tortoises become very tame. Although fond of drinking quantities\r\nof water in long and slowly repeated draughts, they do not go into the\r\nwater, and if they fall in accidentally they are liable to get drowned.\r\nThey enjoy a mixed diet, but animal food predominates, consisting chiefly\r\nof snails, the shells of {363}which are passed, slugs, earthworms, maggots,\r\nand soft caterpillars. Their fondness for slugs is all the more remarkable\r\nsince scarcely any other Vertebrate eats these slimy, sticky molluscs; but\r\na Box-tortoise will make a meal of two or more fat specimens of the black\r\nslug _Arion_, and it will eat dozens of small slugs. It first deliberately\r\nsmells the prey, turns the head sidewards and gives a bite, whereupon first\r\nthe intestines and then the rest are eaten. The slime is later on scraped\r\noff with the fore-limbs, or the head is rubbed against the grass. The\r\nfavourite time of feeding is towards dusk or in the early dewy morning, and\r\nthey are especially lively during a soft, warm rain. They also relish\r\nvarious kinds of fungi and fruit, for instance half-rotten bananas. Close\r\nobservation of their habits gives us indications as to how the change from\r\ncarnivorous to herbivorous habits may have taken place. Accidentally many a\r\nblade of grass is bitten off and swallowed together with the molluscs, also\r\nbits of rotten wood and moss, and their excrements are often full of such\r\nmore or less digested matter. They are not very fond of basking, although\r\nthey love warmth, creeping into the grass, where they make a shallow form\r\nby moving the shell backwards and forwards. During the cooler nights they\r\nfrequently retire into a hole or under a log of wood. They require to\r\nhibernate. If kept in a warm house they become restless in the autumn,\r\nrefuse food, drink and feed again after some weeks, but are liable to die\r\nduring the winter. If they can find a cool place they bury themselves and\r\nsleep for several months. If left out of doors they dig into the ground,\r\ncreep into a hole, at the bottom of which they half bury themselves, or\r\nthey hide under a heap of garden-rubbish well out of the reach of frost.\r\nWarm April days bring them out, and the first requirement is a drink.\r\n\r\nWhen walking about in search of food they assume a curious attitude, with\r\nthe shell well above the ground, the long neck stretched out and raised\r\nhigh. Their temper varies individually. Some become tame readily and lose\r\nall shyness, and creep up to their friend to take food from his fingers.\r\nOthers are decidedly shy and sulky, withdrawing with a hiss into the shell,\r\nwhich in some specimens shuts almost hermetically all round, and they do\r\nnot come out until all imaginary danger is past. One of my males sulked\r\nthus for several months, at least we never saw anything of it except the\r\nclosed shell, but it did not starve itself. {364}Propagation takes place in\r\nthe summer, the long oval hard-shelled eggs being laid in June and July.\r\n\r\nThe TYPICAL LAND-TORTOISES are easily recognised by their feet. The digits\r\nare short, have not more than two joints, and are without any trace of\r\nwebs; the metacarpals are scarcely longer than broad. The hind-feet are\r\nclub-footed. The skin on the anterior side of the fore-limbs is covered\r\nwith strong horny scales, frequently with dermal ossifications. The\r\nplastron is united suturally by a broad bridge with the usually strongly\r\narched carapace. The skull has complete postorbital and temporal arches.\r\nThe top of the head is covered with shields. The tail is short. There are\r\nonly a few recent genera, modifications of the central and typical genus\r\n_Testudo_. The latter is cosmopolitan in the warmer temperate and tropical\r\nregions, except in the Australian and Austro-Malayan countries.\r\n\r\n_Cinyxis_ (Fig. 82) with a few species in Tropical Africa from the Gambia\r\nand from Abyssinia to the Equator is remarkable for the unique modification\r\nof its carapace, the posterior portion of which is movable, the hinge\r\npassing between the seventh and eighth marginal and the fourth and fifth\r\ncostal plates, externally behind the seventh marginal and the second costal\r\nshields. In the middle of the back the hinge is imperfect, the parts being\r\nmerely flexible enough to permit the posterior half of the box to be\r\nclosed. The head is covered with shields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.–Skull of _Testudo nigrita_ s. _elephantopus_, from\r\nthe Galapagos Islands. × ½. _M_, maxillary; _Op_, Opisthotic; _Pr.f_,\r\nprefrontal; _Pr.o_, prootic; _Pt.f_, postfrontal; _Q_, quadrate; _S.o_,\r\nsupra-occipital.]\r\n\r\n_C. belliana_, of Northern Tropical Africa, has a small nuchal shield, and\r\nthe margin of the carapace is smooth. Length of shell up to seven or eight\r\ninches. _C. homeana_, of West Africa, has likewise a small nuchal shield,\r\nbut the posterior portion of the carapace descends vertically, and the\r\nmarginals are strongly reverted and serrated. _C. erosa_ (Fig. 82), also\r\nfrom West Africa, has no nuchal shield; the marginals are reverted and\r\nserrated, but the posterior part of the carapace is sloping, and the\r\nanterior {365}portion of the plastron is strongly forked in front, and\r\nprojects beyond the anterior border of the carapace. This peculiar creature\r\nreaches a length of nine inches. When withdrawn within the shell, which is\r\nclosed behind and depressed in front, with the jagged edges of the plastron\r\nand the anterior marginals protecting the drawn-in head, it has a very\r\nquaint appearance. It lives entirely on fruit and other vegetable matter,\r\nand is said to prefer to lie in the water, while _C. belliana_ is supposed\r\nto be entirely terrestrial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.–_Cinyxis erosa._ × ½.]\r\n\r\n_Pyxis arachnoides_, of Madagascar, a small land-tortoise, only four inches\r\nin length, has an immovable carapace, but the front lobe of the plastron is\r\nhinged.\r\n\r\n_Testudo._–The plastron is immovable, except that in old individuals of\r\nsome species, e.g. _T. ibera_, the hinder lobe develops a transverse\r\nflexible hinge. They have existed since the Oligocene of North America and\r\nEurope; and are now represented by nearly forty species in all the tropical\r\nand warmer temperate countries excepting the Austro-Malayan and Australian\r\nregion. Typically terrestrial, herbivorous and frugivorous, although\r\noccasionally varying their diet with worms, molluscs, and insects. The eggs\r\nare hard-shelled, mostly less oval than those of the aquatic and\r\nsemi-aquatic tortoises. The males generally remain smaller than the\r\nfemales, have a slightly longer tail, and have a concave instead of a flat\r\nplastron. Most land-tortoises hibernate in the ground during the cool and\r\ncold seasons, or they aestivate during the hot and dry months of tropical\r\ncountries, but this is not an invariable rule.\r\n\r\n_T. graeca_, the common \"Greek Tortoise.\" The shell is very convex, without\r\nkeels, and has a smooth, not serrated margin. {366}The nuchal shield is\r\nnarrow. The fifth or last neural shield is much broader than the others.\r\nThe supracaudal is usually divided in the median line, so that this is\r\nreally the last pair of marginals. The plastron is notched behind; the\r\naxillary and inguinal shields are small. The scales on the anterior surface\r\nof the fore-limbs are small, and form from half-a-dozen to ten longitudinal\r\nrows. The hinder surface of the thigh is quite smooth. The tip of the tail\r\nends in a conical, horny spur. The coloration of the shell varies somewhat,\r\nbut the ground-colour is yellow, each shield with a dark brown centre and\r\nirregular patches or confluent spots towards the margin. The plastron has\r\nan irregular, broad black border. The soft parts are grey-yellowish. Some\r\nspecimens are rather pale, almost lemon yellow with little black; others\r\nincline towards orange with more or less black. The middle fields of the\r\nshields of young specimens are granular, although this area is rubbed\r\nsmooth with age; but the rest shows clearly marked concentric lines of\r\ngrowth. The eyes are dark, with a brown or bluish tinge, sometimes\r\ninclining to dark grey in very old specimens.\r\n\r\nFull-grown females have a shell six inches in length. This species inhabits\r\nthe northern half of the Balkan Peninsula, parts of Asia Minor and Syria,\r\nItaly, and most of the islands of the Mediterranean, from the Grecian\r\nArchipelago to the Balearic Islands.\r\n\r\n_T. ibera_ is closely allied to _T. graeca_, from which it differs chiefly\r\nin the following points. The last pair of marginal shields are fused into\r\nan unpaired supracaudal, the median line of division being almost\r\nobliterated. The fifth neural shield is not broader, and generally a little\r\nnarrower than the others. The posterior lobe of the plastron develops with\r\nage a transverse ligamentous hinge, and is thus rendered slightly movable,\r\nespecially in the females. The posterior margin of the carapace is slightly\r\nexpanded in old specimens. The scales of the fore-limb are large and\r\nimbricating, and form only four or five longitudinal rows. On the middle of\r\nthe exposed posterior surface of the thighs the skin carries a strong,\r\nconical, horny tubercle. The coloration is much like that of _T. graeca_,\r\nexcept that the yellow of the young inclines to pale olive. Some specimens\r\nare uniform brownish. This species reaches a much larger size than _T.\r\ngraeca_, old females often measuring eight inches, {367}rarely more than\r\nnine inches in length. Its home is Morocco and Asia Minor, extending into\r\nPersia. It also occurs in certain parts of Southern Andalucia, where it\r\nbreeds regularly, for instance, in the sandy pine-forests of the Marismas,\r\nnear the mouth of the Guadalquivir. Whether it has been introduced from\r\nMorocco, or is indigenous, is an open question. Its specific name refers to\r\nits Iberian home.\r\n\r\n_T. marginata_ is worth mentioning, since it is the Greek tortoise,\r\nalthough not that of the European markets, which are supplied by the other\r\ntwo species. _T. marginata_ is restricted to Greece proper, where it is the\r\nonly land-tortoise. It is less closely allied to _T. graeca_ than to _T.\r\nibera_, of which it may be called an exaggerated form. The posterior margin\r\nof the carapace is much expanded or flanged, and serrated. The supracaudal\r\nis undivided, the posterior lobe of the plastron is movable, but the large\r\nconical spur on the thighs is absent. The dorsal shields of adult specimens\r\nare black with a small yellowish patch; the ventral shields are yellowish,\r\neach with a large black triangular patch. The British Museum possesses a\r\nshell 28 cm. = 11 inches in length.\r\n\r\nThe habits of these Moorish and Greek tortoises are very much alike, and\r\nsince they enjoy the distinction of frequently being kept as pets in\r\ngardens, where they are allowed to look after themselves, a great many\r\nincidental and odd observations have been made on them. They are\r\nessentially vegetable feeders, but their taste varies individually and with\r\nthe season, also according to the vegetation of the country they happen to\r\ncome from. Most of them enjoy juicy plants, for instance, lettuce and\r\ncabbage; the flowers of the dandelion attract them not merely by their\r\nbright colour; clover is also a favourite food, and an enclosure of\r\ngrass-land with clover in it is soon cleared of the latter; grass is also\r\ntaken, in default of anything better. Some of my specimens gradually bite\r\nlarge holes into gourds and pumpkins; and in Morocco I found them in the\r\nautumn feeding entirely on the terribly astringent green fruits of the\r\ndwarf palm _Chamaerops humilis_. The larger specimens bolted the fruit with\r\nthe stones, passing the latter. In close captivity they often learn to take\r\nand to like bread soaked in milk or water. They drink slowly and at length,\r\nbut scarcely ever when they have succulent food. There is one thing which\r\nthey do {368}not eat, namely, \"black beetles,\" although they are warranted\r\nto do so by the men who hawk them in the streets. Worms, slugs, etc. are\r\noften mentioned as part of their occasional diet, but I am not aware that\r\nany of the hundreds which I have watched have taken such creatures, in\r\nspite of every opportunity. Their habits are very regular. They learn to\r\nknow the geography of their domain thoroughly, and the spot selected for\r\nsleeping will be resorted to over and over again, be it underneath some\r\nbroad leaves, under a bushy fir-tree, between a cluster of wallflowers, or\r\nbetween some tussocks, or even in an almost bare corner, the attractions of\r\nwhich are not at all obvious. Although their mental capacities cannot\r\npossibly be called brilliant, they soon learn to distinguish between\r\ndifferent persons, and they will come up to be fed; but their memory for\r\nlocalities is surprising. Here is only one instance. A tortoise which had\r\nbeen put into an outhouse for hibernation was six months later taken to its\r\nusual large enclosure, and in the afternoon it tucked itself away on the\r\ntop of a mound under precisely the same low bush where it used to sleep\r\nduring the previous autumn. It could not see that spot from where it had\r\nbeen put down, and it did not meander about during the day, but after\r\nhaving enjoyed the warm sun it made straight for its favourite place. Dr.\r\nGirtanner of St. Gallen in Switzerland testifies to their appreciation of\r\nmusic. When the town-band began to play on the square adjoining his garden,\r\nall his tortoises crept as fast as possible towards the fence and remained\r\nthere motionless with heads and necks erect. When the piece was finished\r\nthey moved about, but when the next number began they were again\r\nspellbound. This he has observed, not on one but on many occasions. That\r\nthey can hear, although their ears are not visible, but covered by the\r\nordinary skin, is obvious enough from the fact that during the pairing\r\nseason they emit feeble piping sounds.\r\n\r\nThey are extremely fond of basking in the hot sun, sometimes allowing\r\nthemselves to be almost baked in it, but then again at other times they\r\nseem to be anxious to seek the shade. They rise late and go to bed early,\r\nbeing absolutely diurnal. In the summer they leave their quarters when the\r\nsun is well up, making for a sunny spot to graze. Then they lie still and\r\nbask, unless a shower causes them to retreat under shelter. {369}After some\r\nhours' rest they feed again, and in the afternoon, long before sunset, they\r\ngo to bed. Some winters in England are of course much more severe than any\r\nwhich these tortoises experience in their native countries. Still they\r\nmanage to survive them, provided they find a place which they can burrow\r\ninto, deep enough to be out of the reach of frost; and if there is a heap\r\nof mould, rotting weeds, and leaves, they are probably safe. Sometimes they\r\nare restless, coming out again in unusually mild winters without, however,\r\ntaking food. If they appear too early in the spring, they run the risk of\r\nterrible colds on prolonged wet and cold days, but in the autumn they are\r\nhardier, and can stand several degrees of dry frost.\r\n\r\nThe pairing season begins in May, but lasts far into the summer. In Morocco\r\nI found them pairing as late as the month of September. The preliminaries\r\nextend over many days. The male becomes unusually active, makes a piping\r\nsound, runs after the female, draws in its head, and knocks with its shell\r\nagainst that of the female. This is repeated many times, until the female\r\nis excited enough to raise itself upon its hind-limbs. The eggs, only two\r\nto four in number, are laid several weeks later, and are buried in the\r\nground. They are roundish-oval, hard-shelled, and vary according to the\r\nsize of the female. Those of _T. graeca_ measure on the average 30 by 24\r\nmm.; those of a large specimen of _T. ibera_ 32 to 36 by 30 mm. The\r\nnewly-hatched little creatures are still quite flexible, and apparently\r\nsoon bury themselves before beginning their active life in the ensuing\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nThe age which these tortoises can reach is quite unknown, but there are\r\nreliable data of individuals having been kept for many years. Rumpf[133]\r\nkept two _T. graeca_ in his garden at Frankfort-on-the-Main, and let them\r\nhibernate in a box with hay in the cellar. One lived 33, the other 23\r\nyears. The most famous specimen of _T. ibera_ is \"Gilbert White's\r\nTortoise,\"[134] which had been kept for more than 40 years before it came\r\ninto his possession. It used to bury itself in November and to come out in\r\nApril. It died in 1794, having reached an age of fifty-four _plus_ an\r\nunknown number of years, since there is no record of its size when it came\r\nto England. The same applies to every other specimen which has been, and is\r\nbeing, observed as a pet. My {370}largest Morocco female, which has a shell\r\n7 inches long, shows at least 25 concentric rings of growth on the shields;\r\nthe last half-dozen rings are very narrow, while some of those of the\r\ncentral area have been rubbed down. This creature is not improbably 30\r\nyears old. A small female, which is only 5¼ inches long, has already 14\r\nrings on its still perfect shields. Lastly, a little one, only 4 inches\r\nlong, shows 7 rings. They grow fastest when they are about 6 to 7 inches\r\nlong, and they then seem to be at their prime. White's tortoise, now\r\nenshrined in the National Collection, was unusually large, the shell\r\nmeasuring 25 cm., or nearly 10 inches; around the much-enlarged,\r\nrubbed-down areola of each shield are about 30 very narrow rings.\r\n\r\n_T. horsfieldi_ is easily recognised by its possessing only four claws on\r\nthe fore- and hind-limbs. It is closely allied to the species last\r\nmentioned, which it seems to represent in the sandy districts of\r\nTranscaspia and the Kirghiz Steppes to Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n_T. elegans_, the \"Starred Tortoise\" of the southern half of India and\r\nCeylon, is easily recognised by the very convex carapace without a nuchal\r\nshield, and by the beautiful markings of the other shields, each of which\r\nhas a yellow areola, whence radiate yellow streaks upon a black ground.\r\nMoreover, the dorsal shields often form humps. It reaches the length of one\r\nfoot. Old specimens lose the beautiful yellow radiation, owing to a\r\nconsiderable amount of peeling off of the horny layers.\r\n\r\nThe habits have been carefully watched by Captain Thomas Hutton,[135] who\r\ngives the following account. The tortoises live in the grassy jungle at the\r\nbase of the hills, but owing to their colour being so blended with the\r\nrocky nature of the ground, they are with difficulty distinguished.\r\nMoreover, they remain concealed beneath shrubs or grass during the heat of\r\nthe day. In the rainy season they are most active, wandering about all day,\r\nfeeding and pairing. At the approach of the cold weather they select a\r\nsheltered spot and conceal themselves by thrusting their shell into some\r\nthick tuft of grass, remaining there in a sort of lethargic, but not\r\ntorpid, inactivity until the hot season, at which time they remain\r\nconcealed only during the heat of the day, coming out about sunset to feed.\r\n\r\nDuring the hot season Hutton's captives often soaked themselves {371}in\r\nwater, and they drank a great deal. Copulation lasted about ten minutes;\r\nthe females received the males from the end of June to the middle of\r\nOctober. On the 11th of November a female dug a pit at the root of a tuft\r\nof grass, having previously watered the spot, then digging with the\r\nhind-limbs alternately, and continuing to water the soil. In two hours she\r\nhad made a hole six inches deep and four wide; she then laid four pure\r\nwhite eggs, each about 1¾ inches or 45 mm. long, and filled the hole again\r\nwith the prepared mud, pressing it well in with the feet and with the\r\nweight of the body. The whole operation took four hours. From December to\r\nthe beginning of February these tortoises were listless, they then took\r\nwater and some lucerne, but did not come out again until the middle of\r\nApril, well in the hot season. Both males and females wrestled in a curious\r\nway. One confronted the other, with the head and fore-limbs drawn into the\r\nshell, and with the hind-limbs planted firmly on the ground, and in this\r\nmanner shoving against each other in any narrow space. Sometimes, if one\r\nsucceeded in placing its shell beneath the other, he tilted his adversary\r\nover on his back, from which position he had great difficulty in recovering\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n_T. polyphemus_, the \"Gopher Tortoise\" of the south-eastern States of North\r\nAmerica, is one of the few American species. It is characterised by the\r\nshape of the front lobe of the plastron, which is bent upwards, and extends\r\nbeyond the carapace. The nuchal shield is present, not narrow; the\r\nsupracaudal is undivided. The shell is much depressed, and flattened along\r\nthe vertebral region, with rounded margins. The fore-limbs are armed with\r\nvery strong claws. The general colour is very dark brown above, inclining\r\nto black; brownish yellow below, with blackish patches. The length of the\r\nshell is about one foot, or even eighteen inches.\r\n\r\nThe Gopher is interesting for its habits, which are described by Agassiz,\r\nSchnee, and others. Its domicile consists of an excavation, the mouth of\r\nwhich is just sufficient to admit the animal, the burrow running in an\r\noblique direction to the depth of about four feet. The whole passage is\r\nsometimes more than two yards long. It expands from the entrance, and ends\r\nin a roomy space, sometimes with a few branches of fir trees which have\r\nbeen dragged in either for food or as a lining. The burrow {372}is\r\ninhabited by one pair only. When the dew is on the grass, or after rain,\r\nthey emerge in search of food, which consists of grass, succulent\r\nvegetables, fruit, etc. They also eat the gum that exudes from trees,\r\nespecially the resin of the pine. The eggs are laid in June, not in their\r\ndomicile, but in a separate cavity near the entrance; a set consists of\r\nfive eggs, almost round, and very large, namely, 40 mm., or more than one\r\ninch and a half in diameter. To capture the Gopher a deep hole is dug at\r\nthe mouth of their home, into which they fall as they emerge for food. In\r\nSouthern Texas and neighbouring parts of Mexico they are represented by a\r\nsmaller and lighter coloured species.\r\n\r\n_T. tabulata_, widely spread over Tropical South America, whence it is\r\noften brought over as a curiosity, reaches a large size, specimens nearly\r\ntwo feet in length being not uncommon. The shell is flat on the top, and is\r\nvery elongated, without a nuchal, but with an undivided supracaudal shield.\r\nThe carapace is very dark brown or black, each shield with a yellow or\r\norange centre; the plastron is brown and yellow, the dark colour being\r\nmostly confined to the middle portion. The ground-colour of the skin of the\r\nlimbs is blackish, but the scales are orange or red. The head is yellow and\r\nblack. This species inhabits the forests, and lives chiefly on the fruits\r\nof trees; in captivity they are said to take bread soaked in milk or water,\r\nlemons, apples, bananas, cabbage, gourds, and also meat, at least the\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nGIGANTIC LAND-TORTOISES differ from the others in no essential points\r\nexcept their large size. The term gigantic is, however, applied to many of\r\nthem by courtesy only, since they do not exceed the dimensions of large\r\nTurtles. A truly gigantic species, _T. atlas_, has left its remains in the\r\nSivalik Hills of late Miocene or early Pliocene date. The skull is between\r\nseven and eight inches long, and is well preserved, but the correctness of\r\nthe dimensions of the specimen, as it now stands, restored in the National\r\nCollection, is open to doubt. The shell was probably not more than six feet\r\nlong. Miocene and Pliocene Europe was also inhabited by large tortoises,\r\nwith shells about four feet long, _e.g._ _T. perpigniana_, whose bony\r\nplates are one inch thick; others have been found in North America. Such\r\nlarge tortoises are now restricted to two widely separated regions of the\r\nworld, namely the Galapagos Islands (which have received their name from\r\nthese creatures, _galápago_ being one of the Spanish terms for\r\n{373}tortoise), and the islands in the Western Indian Ocean, namely the\r\nMascarenes (Bourbon, Mauritius, and Rodriguez), the Comoros, Aldabra, the\r\nAmirantes, and the Seychelles. When they became extinct in Madagascar is\r\nnot known, but _T. grandidieri_ was a very large species of apparently very\r\nrecent date. Of the other islands the Comoros only were inhabited by man,\r\nthe others were devoid of any but small and harmless Mammals. It was on\r\nthese peaceful islands that large tortoises lived in incredible numbers,\r\nand, like the Dodo of Mauritius and the Solitaire of Rodriguez, grew to a\r\nsize far beyond that of their less favourably placed continental relations.\r\nThe same applies to the tortoises of the Galapagos Islands. Plenty of food,\r\na congenial equable climate, and absence of enemies enabled them to enjoy\r\nexistence to the fullest extent. There was nothing for them to do but to\r\nthrive, to feed, to propagate, to grow, and to vary. At least there was\r\nnothing to check variation within reasonable limits. Scattered over the\r\nmany islands, they were prevented from inter-breeding, and thus it has come\r\nto pass that not only every group of islands, but in the case of the\r\nGalapagos almost every island, has or had its own particular kind, be these\r\ncalled varieties, races, forms, or species.\r\n\r\nThere are four features of special interest. First, these tortoises grow to\r\na large size, and there are no small species on any of these islands.\r\nSecondly, they vary much individually. Thirdly, each island or group of\r\nislands has developed its own kind. Lastly, there is the widely spread\r\ntendency to reduce the thickness of the bony plates of the carapace, in\r\nspite of its size. In some cases, notably _T. vosmaeri_ of Rodriguez, the\r\nbony shell is reduced to apparently the utmost limit compatible with\r\nmechanical safety. The horny shields are, or were, however, well developed,\r\nsometimes much more so than in other recent land-tortoises. Whatever were\r\nthe original reasons for the development of a strong shell in tortoises,\r\nthey cannot have prevailed in these islands.\r\n\r\nWhere did all these tortoises come from, and how did they get to these\r\noceanic islands? Accidental transport or migration are out of the question.\r\nLand-tortoises are drowned within a few hours. Moreover, there are none of\r\ntheir kind on the continents of Africa, Asia, and South America, although\r\nthey had a much wider distribution in past geological ages. Consequently we\r\nhave to assume that they are descendants of tortoises once populating the\r\nland which, except the islands, lies now below {374}the western Indian\r\nocean. The existence of this, \"Lemuria\" or \"Gondwana,\" came to an end in\r\nMid-Tertiary times. The large tortoises on the remaining continents died\r\nout–in any case they are gone, while those which lived on, or retreated to,\r\nwhat became the present islands, survived and flourished.\r\n\r\nThe tortoises were not left in peace with the advent of man, who found that\r\nthey were good to eat. They were first exterminated on the Mascarene\r\nIslands. In 1759 four small vessels were specially appointed for the\r\nservice of bringing tortoises from Rodriguez to Mauritius; one vessel\r\ncarried a cargo of 6000; and altogether more than 30,000 were imported into\r\nMauritius within the space of eighteen months. Dr. Günther very properly\r\nremarks that many of these tortoises must have been small-sized specimens,\r\nand that many of them were probably used for provisioning passing\r\nGovernment vessels. Anyhow an inter-insular traffic was carried on, and\r\nthere are records of superfluous tortoises having been turned loose, at the\r\nend of the voyage, in distant islands, even in Java. Importation and\r\nexchange of choice specimens, by way of presents, seems also to have taken\r\nplace. All this makes it now actually impossible to trace the original\r\nhabitat of the few surviving specimens with anything like certainty. At the\r\nbeginning of this century the large tortoises had been nearly cleared off\r\nmost of the islands, and at the present time only the south island of\r\nAldabra enjoys the reputation of still possessing some really indigenous\r\ntortoises. The few survivors on the other islands are said to have been\r\nintroduced. The small stock at Aldabra is now under Government protection.\r\nRepresentatives of various species will linger on for a little time to\r\ncome, when they are kept as pets on some tropical islands, but those which\r\nhave been brought to Europe are of course doomed.\r\n\r\nWe can mention only a few of the large tortoises which have become famous,\r\nnot to say historical. A fascinating résumé of the whole complicated\r\nquestion has been given by Dr. Günther.[136]\r\n\r\n_Testudo gigantea_ s. _elephantina_ s. _hololissa_ s. _ponderosa_,\r\noriginally confined to the North Island of Aldabra, where this {375}kind\r\nhas been completely exterminated, is now still to be found in the\r\nSeychelles in considerable numbers, introduced there by planters, and kept\r\nin a state of semi-domestication. A very large specimen was received by the\r\nHon. Walter Rothschild, at Tring, in 1893. In 1897 its shell measured 40¼\r\ninches in length, 52¼ over the curve, and 50 inches across the curve\r\ntransversely; it weighed 358 lbs. The measurements taken in previous years\r\nare unfortunately not free from mistakes. \"Whenever the temperature was\r\nover 60° F. this tortoise had a free run of 350 acres of grass park, and\r\nwhen the temperature showed permanently below 58°, it was kept in an orchid\r\nhouse from September to June. When at liberty in the park it lived entirely\r\non grass, but in the hothouse it fed on carrots, cabbage, lettuce, and\r\nseveral other vegetables\"; it was also very fond of rotten fruit. To this\r\nspecies belongs the large tortoise which has been living at St. Helena for\r\nmore than the last hundred years.\r\n\r\n_T. daudini_ is the species of the South Island of Aldabra. Voeltzkow, in\r\n1895, succeeded in carrying off seven specimens. He gives the following\r\ndescription:–The island is an atoll, cut through in three places, with a\r\ngreatest length of about twenty miles. The chief hindrance in the search\r\nfor the tortoises is the impenetrability of the island. The soil consists\r\nentirely of sharp water-worn corals, with their points uppermost, while the\r\nwhole is covered with such thick masses of low scrub, that a way has to be\r\ncut with an axe, so that an extended search over a large area is out of the\r\nquestion. To land on the outside is dangerous, on account of the heavy\r\nsurf; while landing from the inside of the atoll is much hindered by the\r\ndense thickets of mangrove trees. As drinking water, and that very bad, is\r\nonly found in one place, rainwater has to be collected from the natural\r\nhollows, and carried along in tanks. Thousands of mosquitoes prevent one\r\nremaining over night in those places which the tortoises frequent. Then at\r\nlast, when one has discovered, by a stroke of luck, one of these creatures,\r\nin the thick scrub, where they hide during the heat of the day, the real\r\nhard work begins, namely, the conveyance of the beast. Six reached Europe\r\nalive, two of them were sent to Frankfort, and the four others to Hamburg.\r\nMr. Rothschild received a male of _T. daudini_, which, until its recent\r\ndeath, was the largest living tortoise known. The length {376}of its shell\r\nwas 55 inches, or 67½ inches over the curve; total weight 560 lbs. This\r\nspecimen had a chequered career. Although its original home must have been\r\nthe Aldabra atoll, it had been known for many years on Egmont Island, one\r\nof the Chagos Islands. According to tradition, it had been there some 150\r\nyears, but the first settlement on that island was formed from Mauritius\r\nonly at the beginning of this century. The owner of the tortoise, M.\r\nAntelme, took it to Mauritius, whence it came to England. On the Egmont\r\nIsland it used to bury itself for six months in the ground without eating\r\nanything.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.–_Testudo daudini_ (above) and _T. abingdoni_\r\n(below). × 1/20.]\r\n\r\n_T. sumeirei._–This kind is supposed to have been the species peculiar to\r\nthe Seychelles. In 1766 five large tortoises were brought from the\r\nSeychelles to Mauritius by Chevalier Marion de Tresne. Of these only three\r\nwere alive in 1898, two in {377}Mauritius and one in London; the latter\r\nspecimen soon died in the Zoological Gardens. One of the two survivors, the\r\nlast of their race, is famous. It was kept at Port Louis, and when\r\nMauritius became a British possession in 1810, the tortoise was especially\r\nmentioned and taken over. It still lives there in the grounds of the\r\nbarracks of the garrison. According to the proverbial oldest inhabitants it\r\nhad in 1810 already reached its present size, namely, a shell-length of\r\nabout 40 inches with a greatest circumference of 259 cm. = 8 feet 6 inches.\r\nTotal weight 160 kilo = about 358 lbs. When walking it stands 63.5 cm. =\r\n25.4 inches high, with the plastron about 15 cm. or 6 inches above the\r\nground, and it can then carry with ease two full-grown men on its back.\r\nThis old male is now nearly blind, but is otherwise of regular habits and\r\nin good health. Although it has been known for nearly 150 years it had to\r\nwait for its scientific name until the year 1892.\r\n\r\nAnother famous individual is the Colombo tortoise. It is supposed to have\r\ncome to Colombo from the Seychelles in 1798. It died in 1897. To judge from\r\nphotographs, this specimen, a male, may possibly belong to _T. sumeirei_,\r\nin spite of the very flat shell, which is 53½ inches in length.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the remains of sub-fossil tortoises, _e.g._ the thin-shelled\r\n_T. vosmaeri_ of Rodriguez, and several kinds which have been dug out in\r\nthe Mare-aux-songes of Mauritius, one of which had a markedly forked and\r\nprolonged anterior plastral lobe, rather resembling that of the Pliocene\r\nSivalik _T. atlas_, we now turn to the tortoises of the Galapagos Islands.\r\nThey existed in enormous numbers towards the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, when Dampier visited those islands. Hundreds were exported and\r\nscattered early in the nineteenth century. When the islands became a penal\r\nsettlement of Ecuador, the introduction of convicts and pigs proved\r\ndetrimental to them, but Darwin found them still present in 1835 on most of\r\nthe islands. His classical account of these old giants is to be found in\r\nthe _Voyage of the Beagle_. They lived on the succulent cactus plants,\r\nleaves of trees, berries, and a kind of _Usnea_, a lichen pendant from the\r\ntrees. They collected regularly at certain pools and springs, leading to\r\nwhich were regular well-trodden paths, formed by the coming and going of\r\nthe tortoises. He calculated that they could walk a distance of about four\r\nmiles in one day. During {378}the time of propagation the males emit a\r\nhoarse bark, which can be heard a hundred yards off. The round eggs measure\r\nabout 5 cm. or 2 inches in diameter, and are laid in the month of October,\r\nabout one dozen making a set.\r\n\r\nNearly every island had apparently its own kind. They are all remarkable\r\nfor their small head and the length of their neck, which is decidedly\r\nlonger and more slender than that of the Eastern tortoises. The most\r\npeculiar looking are or were _T. ephippium_ and _T. abingdoni_, the shell\r\nof which is extremely thin, with large lacunae in the osseous plates. The\r\nprofile of the shell is somewhat saddle-shaped, with the horny shields\r\npartly concave and turned upwards at the sides. The general colour of these\r\nand the other Galapagos tortoises is black. _T. ephippium_ still survives\r\non Duncan Island. Of _T. elephantopus_ s. _vicina_ Baur collected\r\ntwenty-one specimens in 1893 on Albemarle Island. Some of them are still\r\ncomparatively young, only 16 inches long. A large one was killed, and,\r\nbeing hard up for water, Baur and his companions drank the five cups full\r\nof fluid contained in the pericardial sac; they found it most refreshing,\r\nand tasting somewhat like the white of an egg. One monster is said to have\r\nmeasured 56 inches over the curve, with a skull 7.12 inches in length. Mr.\r\nRothschild received one of this kind alive–a much-travelled specimen. It\r\ncame to England from Sydney, whether it had been brought in 1880 from\r\nRotuma Island, north of the Fiji group. There it had probably been left\r\nwith others by Captain Porter, who, on his voyage from the Galapagos in\r\n1813, distributed several young tortoises from his stock among the chiefs,\r\nand permitted a great many to escape into the bushes and among the grass.\r\nThe shell of this specimen measured 49½ inches in length, 56 over the\r\ncurve.\r\n\r\nFAM. 6. CHELONIDAE (_Turtles_).–The limbs are paddle-shaped, and the shell\r\nis covered with horny shields. Only two recent genera, with three species,\r\nwidely distributed in the seas.\r\n\r\nThe neck is short and incompletely retractile. The temporal region of the\r\nskull is completely roofed over above and laterally by the parietals,\r\npostfrontals, squamosals, quadrato-jugals and jugals. All these bones are\r\nmuch expanded, and form the additional or false roof. The parietals are\r\nespecially large, and are in broad contact with the squamosals. Nasals are\r\nabsent. The nares are bordered by the small premaxillaries, the\r\nmaxillaries, {379}and the prefrontals. The choanae are enclosed by the\r\npalatines, which are separated by the vomer, and are posteriorly in broad\r\ncontact with the pterygoids. The latter are connected with descending\r\nprocesses of the parietals by epipterygoids. The foramen magnum is bounded\r\nnot only by the supra-occipital and the lateral occipitals, but also by the\r\nbasi-occipital. For the skeleton see Fig. 65, p. 320. The pubic and\r\nischiadic symphyses are connected by a narrow cartilaginous band. The pubis\r\nhas a large, broad, lateral process, but the ischium is devoid of such a\r\nprocess. The paddles of the fore- and hind-limbs are produced by an\r\nelongation of the metacarpal and metatarsal bones and of most of the\r\nphalanges, and these have no condyles; most of the carpal and tarsal\r\nelements are flattened, and additional width is given to the hands by the\r\nmuch enlarged pisiform bone. The number of phalanges of the five fingers is\r\n2, 3, 3, 2, 2; that of the five toes, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.–Skull of _Thalassochelys caretta_; cf. also Fig.\r\n63, p. 317. _A_, Dorsal view; _B_, ventral view; _F_, frontal; _Jg_, jugal;\r\n_Mx_, maxillary; _Op_, opisthotic; _P_, parietal; _Pal_, palatine; _Pr.f_,\r\nprefrontal; _Pt.f_, postfrontal; _Ptg_, pterygoid; _Q_, quadrate; _Quadr_,\r\narticular surface of quadrate; _Qj_, quadrato-jugal; _S.o_,\r\nsupra-occipital; _Sq_, squamosal.]\r\n\r\nThe carapace is heart-shaped and very flat. The nuchal plate has no\r\nrib-like processes. The eight neurals form a continuous series, and the\r\nshort tail is covered by two or three pygal plates besides the unpaired\r\nlast marginal. The number of all the {380}marginals is 23, sometimes 25\r\nindividually. The plastron (Fig. 66, p. 321) is composed of the usual nine\r\nplates, which, however, remain entirely free from the marginals, and are\r\nonly loosely connected with each other, enclosing a very large unossified\r\nspace. The horny shields covering the plastron number 13, and there is a\r\nseries of about 5 inframarginals (Fig. 61, 6, p. 315). There are normally\r\n12 pairs of marginal shields, a nuchal, 5 neural, and 5 or 7 costal\r\nshields. Whilst the number of these dorsal shields is pretty constant in\r\n_Chelone_, it is subject to an astonishing amount of individual variation\r\nin _Thalassochelys_.\r\n\r\nThe Chelonidae are a highly specialised offshoot of the Cryptodira adapted\r\nto marine life. Fundamentally they agree most with the Testudinidae,\r\nparadoxical as this may appear at first sight. There is nothing primitive\r\nabout them except the complete series of inframarginal shields. Fossil\r\nforerunners of marine turtle-like creatures appear in the Upper Jurassic\r\ndeposits of Europe and North America. The numerous genera have been grouped\r\ntogether as Thalassemydidae and Chelonemydidae. They are more or less\r\nintermediate between Chelonidae and _Emys_-like Testudinidae, the carapace\r\nbeing not too much flattened and broadened out, the fontanelles between the\r\nribs are mostly small, the plastral bones are still broad, enclose a\r\nsmaller ossified space, and there is still a bony bridge in most cases. The\r\npaddle-shape of the limbs is less pronounced, and sometimes only indicated.\r\nIn some forms, especially _Lytoloma_, from the Upper Cretaceous and Eocene\r\nof North America and Europe, the anterior portion of the skull is much\r\nlonger than in the Chelonidae, the vomer and the premaxillaries are\r\nelongated, and the anterior portion of the roof of the mouth, with the\r\ncorresponding parts of the lower jaw, seems to have carried crushing pads.\r\nSome of the best-known Upper Jurassic genera are _Eurysternum_ and\r\n_Idiochelys_; _Plesiochelys_ from the Purbeck and Wealden; _Allopleuron\r\nhofmanni_ from the Upper Cretaceous of Belgium approaches _Chelone_ by the\r\nlarge fontanelles between the small marginal and the short costal plates.\r\nTrue Chelonidae are very rare and imperfect in the Mid-Tertiary strata, but\r\nboth recent genera seem to have existed since Pliocene times.\r\n\r\nThe few recent Chelonidae are entirely marine, going on land only in order\r\nto deposit their eggs in the sands of unfrequented shores. Their\r\ndistribution, in conformity with their oceanic life, {381}is almost\r\ncosmopolitan within the warmer zones, but not a few find their way far into\r\nthe temperate seas. They are all eagerly hunted by man either for food or\r\nfor the sake of the tortoiseshell.\r\n\r\n_Chelone._–With only four pairs of costal shields. Carapace with large\r\npersisting fontanelles between the costal and marginal plates. Two species.\r\n\r\n_Ch. mydas_ (the \"Green or Edible Turtle\"), has when adult a nearly smooth\r\nshell, all the shields being juxtaposed, fitting closely into each other,\r\nand becoming quite smooth with age. The neural shields of younger specimens\r\nhave a feeble keel. The twenty-five shields which surround the carapace\r\nform a smooth, or but indistinctly serrated rim. The head is covered with\r\none pair of prefrontal shields, the others are small. The horny beaks of\r\nthe upper and lower jaws have denticulated outer edges, those of the upper\r\njaw having two pairs of strong denticulated ridges. The limbs have\r\ngenerally only one claw, namely on the first digit. This claw, although\r\nsometimes curved and thick, and more than an inch in length, is blunt. The\r\ngeneral colour is olive or brown above, with yellowish spots or blotches;\r\nthe under parts are pale yellowish. This species attains a large size, with\r\na length of shell of nearly four feet, but the usual length of full-grown\r\nspecimens is three feet, and these weigh, when in good condition, more than\r\nthree hundredweight. Their home is in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific\r\nOceans, but there are certain regions in which they are more common than in\r\nothers. Famous centres are the Island of Ascension, the West Indies, and\r\nthe coast of Mosquito, at least for commercial purposes. As they require\r\nsandy, easily accessible beaches for the deposition of their eggs, they\r\ncongregate in certain parts of the world more than in others, and being\r\nstrictly vegetable feeders, they are naturally bound to the coasts,\r\nalthough they are sometimes met with far out at sea. Their chief food\r\nconsists of algae, and of _Zostera marina_, the edible \"Dulce,\" which grows\r\nplentifully in the lagoons of the coast of Florida. When they have eaten\r\ntheir fill, they are said to chop off more of these plants, and roll them,\r\ntogether with the adherent mud, into balls of the size of a head, and these\r\nballs, receding with the tide, are followed by the Turtles.\r\n\r\nWhilst in the water they are caught in various ways, with {382}nets or\r\nharpoons. In some parts of the world the natives follow them in a boat, and\r\nwhen they espy a turtle crawling along the bottom, a man, attached to a\r\nrope, dives in, clasps it, and is brought up by his companions together\r\nwith his prey. Turtles are fond of basking asleep, floating on the surface,\r\nand they are then harpooned from a stealthily approaching boat. The most\r\noriginal mode of catching them is that used by the natives of Torres\r\nStraits, Madagascar, and Cuba. The turtle-fishers go out in the boat to a\r\nspot frequented by grazing turtles; a long string is tied to the tail of a\r\nfish, _Echeneis_, a member of the Mackerel family, and the _Echeneis_,\r\nanxious to get away to protective shelter, makes for a turtle, and attaches\r\nitself to the turtle's plastron by means of the large sucking apparatus on\r\nthe top of its head and neck-region. The men are guided by the string, and\r\nthe turtle is gently coaxed up towards the surface or followed into shallow\r\nwater, where it is either harpooned or dived for. It is curious that this\r\nuse of the _Echeneis_ exists in such widely separated parts of the world,\r\nthe natives of which cannot have any knowledge of each other. These modes\r\nof catching turtles are sportsman-like, but the greatest and most wanton\r\ndestruction is practised at their breeding places. In conformity with the\r\nwide distribution of these creatures, the time of breeding is not the same\r\neverywhere. In the West Indian region, and in the Straits of Malacca, it\r\nfalls within the period of April to June; on the coast of West Africa it\r\noccurs from September to January. The females come to their breeding places\r\nfrom afar, reconnoitre the beach carefully, are extremely wary and shy,\r\ntaking alarm at the slightest disturbance, and at last crawl on land. Well\r\nout of the reach of the tide the female scoops out a hole in the sand,\r\ndeposits about one hundred or more of its round, rather parchment-shelled\r\neggs, covers the nest carefully, obliterating all traces of the dug-out\r\nsand, and makes again for the sea by another route. At least they are said\r\nto make a sort of circuitous route so that nobody can tell the position of\r\nthe nest, which may be anywhere beneath the broad trail left by the heavy\r\ncreature on its way from and back to the sea. The nest is discovered by\r\nprobing the sand with sticks. The time of incubation is not known, but\r\naccording to Agassiz, lasts at least seven weeks.\r\n\r\n{383}[Illustration: FIG. 85.–Three turned Turtles, a Seal, and Albatrosses,\r\nLaysan Islands, north-west of the Sandwich Islands. From a photograph\r\nbelonging to the Hon. W. Rothschild.]\r\n\r\n{384}The \"turning\" of turtles is a cruel and wanton operation, since\r\nfrequently many more are turned over and left to perish than are taken\r\naway. Men lying in ambush watch the beast, or they approach the lonely\r\nsandy shore by boat, and rush the helpless creatures when these are\r\nsurprised in sufficient numbers. It takes several men to lift a full-grown\r\nspecimen. It is therefore necessary to secure them by turning them over\r\nwith poles or by their flippers, lest they should crawl away. On board ship\r\nthey are either put into tanks or tied with ropes on deck, covered with a\r\nmoistened cloth; and occasionally a piece of bread, soaked in sea-water, is\r\nthrust into the parched mouth. In London they are kept in large tanks,\r\noften in considerable numbers, but since they take no food in captivity, or\r\nrather because it is difficult to supply them with the right sort, they are\r\nnot kept long. After the head has been cut off, the body is suspended for a\r\nday or two, in order to drain it of the blood. It is not only the meat and\r\nthe fat which are used for the making of the famous soup, but also the\r\nthick and dense layer of subcutaneous tissue which lines the inside of the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nTennent describes a revolting spectacle exhibited in the markets of Jaffna,\r\nin Ceylon. The flesh of the turtles is sold piecemeal by the Tamil\r\nfishermen, while the animals are still alive. At certain seasons, says the\r\nsame authority, the flesh of turtle on the south-west coast of Ceylon is\r\nusually avoided as poisonous, but some lamentable instances are recorded of\r\nneglect of this, and consequent sickness, followed by coma and death. In\r\nthe Gulf of Manaar specimens are frequently found between four and five\r\nfeet in length; and on one occasion, in riding along the seashore north of\r\nPutlam, he saw a man in charge of some sheep, resting under the shade of a\r\nturtle shell, which he had erected on sticks to protect him from the sun.\r\nIn connexion with this curious sight, Tennent quotes Aelian's statements,\r\ncopied by him from Megasthenes' _Indica Frag._ lix. 31, that in the Indian\r\nocean turtles occur which measure fifteen ells, so that not a few people\r\nmay find ample shelter beneath a single shell.\r\n\r\n_Ch. imbricata_ (\"Hawksbill Turtle\").–The number of shields covering the\r\ncarapace is the same as in _Ch. mydas_, but they strongly imbricate, or\r\noverlap each other from before backwards, until the animal is very old,\r\nwhen the shields become juxtaposed.\r\n\r\n{385}[Illustration: FIG. 86.–_Chelone imbricata_ (\"Hawksbill Turtle\"),\r\nyoung. × ½.]\r\n\r\nIn young specimens, under one foot in length, each of the neural and costal\r\nshields is strongly keeled, the three rows of keels converging towards the\r\nposterior end of the shell. The neural series of keels is almost\r\ncontinuous, and remains longest, even in half-grown specimens. The twelve\r\npairs of marginal shields form at first a strongly serrated sharp edge; the\r\nserrations disappear gradually on the front portion, but remain on the\r\nposterior half of the shell. The horny covers of the jaws form a hooked\r\nbeak, with sharp but smooth or feebly denticulated margins. The fore- and\r\nhind-flippers have two claws. The young are pale brown above, blackish\r\nbelow; the shell of the adult is beautifully marbled with yellow on a rich\r\ndark-brown ground; the plastron is yellow. The shields and scales of the\r\nhead and limbs are dark brown, with yellow margins. The top of the head is\r\ncovered by a large unpaired frontal and a pair of prefrontal or\r\ninterorbital shields. This Turtle does not reach the size of the green or\r\nedible kind; the largest shell on record is in the National Collection, and\r\nmeasures 85 cm. = 34 inches in length. They range over all the tropical and\r\nsubtropical seas. They are apparently strictly {386}carnivorous, living\r\nupon fish and molluscs, the shells of which they crunch. Although not\r\neaten, they are much persecuted on account of their shells, the horny\r\nshields of which are the \"tortoiseshell\" of commerce. A large specimen\r\nyields up to 8 lbs. Few of the shields are, however, thick enough to be\r\nmanufactured into the larger articles which art and fashion delight in, but\r\nif heated in oil, or boiled, they can be welded together under pressure,\r\nand be given any desired shape. In genuine articles of Oriental manufacture\r\nthese welds can generally be detected, or their compound nature is\r\nindicated by the beautiful pattern, which is too regular in the imitations\r\nnow common. Even the shavings and leavings can be welded and moulded into\r\nlarge pieces. The stripping of the shields has been described by Sir E.\r\nTennent. \"If taken from the animal after death and decomposition, the\r\ncolour of the shell becomes clouded and milky, and hence the cruel\r\nexpedient is resorted to of seizing the turtles as they repair to the shore\r\nto deposit their eggs, and suspending them over fires till heat makes the\r\nplates on the dorsal shields start from the bone of the carapace, after\r\nwhich the creature is permitted to escape to the water. At Celebes, where\r\nthe finest tortoise-shell is exported to China, the natives kill the\r\nturtles by blows on the head, and immerse the shell in boiling water to\r\ndetach the shields. Dry heat is only resorted to by the unskilful, who\r\nfrequently destroy the tortoise-shell in the operation.\" The cruel process\r\ndescribed above is resorted to \"for economy's sake,\" the Singhalese\r\nbelieving that such maltreated turtles regenerate the shields, to be caught\r\nand shipped again. Since none of them are actually re-caught in the\r\nmutilated condition, this is looked upon as a proof of the correctness of\r\nthe treatment. It is more likely that they die.\r\n\r\nNew shields can be reproduced only if the underlying Malpighian layer of\r\ncells (_cf._ Fig. 68, B, p. 323) is not killed by the roasting. However,\r\nDr. Charles Hose, with his long experience in Borneo, is positive that\r\nnumerous individuals are there caught which have imperfectly mended shells,\r\nthe shields of which do not imbricate, are thin, and almost worthless.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that the same individuals return again and again to\r\nthe same spot for laying. This is very likely the case. Tennent mentions\r\nthat in the year 1826 a Hawksbill was taken near Hambangtotte, which bore a\r\nring attached to one of its fins, that had been placed there by a Dutch\r\n{387}officer thirty years before, with a view of establishing the fact of\r\nthese recurring visits to the same beach. The same homing instinct has been\r\nobserved in some females of the Green Turtle, which, having been brought\r\nfrom the Tortugas Keys to Key West off the south end of Florida, escaped,\r\nand were, a few days later, re-caught at the Tortugas. On the other hand,\r\nexperiments made with turtles at Ascension are said to have had no result.\r\n\r\n_Thalassochelys_, with five pairs of costal shields. The carapace is\r\ncompletely ossified in the adult, leaving no fontanelles between the ribs\r\nand the marginals.\r\n\r\n_Th. caretta_ (the \"Loggerhead Turtle\").–The shields of the carapace\r\nimbricate only in young specimens, in the adult they become smooth and\r\njuxtaposed. The margin is serrated posteriorly. The carapace of the young\r\nhas three strong keels. The intergular shield is very small or absent. The\r\nmarginals, including the nuchal, usually number 23, rarely 25. The large\r\nhead is armed with hooked jaws, the crushing surface of the horny upper\r\nbeak has a median prominent ridge. The top of the head has a pair of\r\nshields in front of the unpaired frontal. The flippers of the young have\r\nclaws on the first and second digits; in the adult usually only that of the\r\nfirst digit remains. The general colour of the shell is uniform brown\r\nabove, yellowish below. Very young specimens are uniform dark brown or\r\nblackish above and below.\r\n\r\nLarge individuals have a shell about three feet and a half in length. The\r\nLoggerhead is carnivorous, and is commercially of no value. Its habits seem\r\nto be the same as those of the other Turtles, but it has a much wider\r\ndistribution. Besides all the tropical and intertropical seas, it inhabits\r\nthe Mediterranean, and is an accidental visitor to the western coasts of\r\nEurope, especially Portugal and the Bay of Biscay. It has been caught\r\nseveral times on the coast of Belgium, and an old female containing 1150\r\neggs was captured in 1894 on the Dutch coast. In 1861 one was caught near\r\nPenman, on the coast of Banffshire, and a second in the completely\r\nland-locked Loch Lomond.[137] It has been more frequently recorded from the\r\ncoast of Devon and Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature of the Loggerhead is the {388}astonishing\r\nvariability in the number of the horny shields of the carapace. The normal\r\nnumber of shields of the carapace, leaving out the marginals and counting\r\nthe nuchal as the first neural, is 6 neurals and 5 pairs of costals, in all\r\n16. The greatest number of dorsal shields observed is 8 neurals and 8 pairs\r\nof costals, in all 24. Many of the intermediate combinations have been\r\nobserved, there being, for instance, specimens with 8 neurals and 16, 14,\r\n13, 12, or 11 costals, the latter not being always in pairs, but unequal on\r\nthe right and left sides; or there are 7 neurals with 20 to 16 costals, or\r\n6 neurals with 20, 19, 18, 17, or 16 costals. The interesting fact in\r\nconnexion with these variations is, moreover, that some of the shields are\r\nmuch smaller than the others, sometimes mere vestiges in all stages of\r\ngradual suppression, and that the abnormalities are much more common in\r\nbabies and small specimens than in adults. The importance of these\r\n\"orthogenetic\" variations has been discussed on p. 326.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 2. PLEURODIRA.–_Neck bending laterally and tucked away in the\r\nniche formed between the anterior portion of the carapace and plastron.\r\nPelvis ankylosed to the shell, the broadened tops of the ilia to the\r\ncarapace, the distal ends of the pubes and ischia to the plastron._\r\n\r\nFreshwater tortoises, almost entirely carnivorous, inhabiting South\r\nAmerica, Australia, Africa, and Madagascar. Fossil forms are known from the\r\nJurassic epoch onwards.\r\n\r\nOwing to the strong connexion of the iliac bones with the costal plates the\r\nsacrum has become practically abolished, the sacral ribs being reduced to\r\none pair (the posterior of the original two pairs) or being absent. The\r\ncentra of the cervical vertebrae articulate by cup and ball joints. The\r\nformation of the temporal region of the skull varies considerably in the\r\nthree families, some genera lacking the complete zygomatic arch, while\r\nothers have a narrow parieto-squamosal arch bridging over the temporal\r\nfossa, or the latter is completely roofed over by the laterally expanded\r\nparietal, which meets the jugal and quadrato-jugal. The quadrate is always\r\ntrumpet-shaped; the rim of the tympanum is complete, but the posterior part\r\nof the trumpet remains open. The basisphenoid, pterygoids, and palatines\r\nform a broad and flat roof to the mouth. The vomer is large, and separates\r\nthe palatines in the Chelydidae; it is very much {389}reduced or absent in\r\nthe Pelomedusidae, in which the palatines meet. All the Chelydidae, except\r\n_Chelys_, have nasal bones which remain distinct from the prefrontals. The\r\nchoanae lie in front of the palatines, divided by the vomer when this is\r\npresent, but they are not roofed in ventrally.\r\n\r\nThe ilia are solidly ankylosed in the adult with the neighbouring costal\r\nplates, mostly with the last two pairs, sometimes also with the pygal\r\nplate. The lateral processes of the pubes fuse with the xiphiplastra. The\r\nischia are also attached to the same plastral elements.\r\n\r\nThe carapace is flat and completely ossified. The nuchal plate is always\r\nconspicuous, much larger than the neurals, and these are often reduced by\r\nbeing encroached upon by the eight pairs of costal plates, which then meet\r\nin the dorsal line. In _Sternothaerus_ all the eight neurals are present\r\nand form a continuous row. In most of the other genera they are reduced to\r\nseven, the last being squeezed out. In _Rhinemys_ they are reduced to the\r\nsecond, third and fourth and an isolated fifth, and in _Hydraspis_ they are\r\nall gone. The pygal plate is always, even in _Sternothaerus_, separated\r\nfrom the last neural by the eighth pair of costals. The marginals number\r\n23, but in _Carettochelys_ only 21.\r\n\r\nThe carapace is covered with horny shields, except in _Carettochelys_. The\r\nnuchal is absent in the Pelomedusidae and in a few Chelydidae (_Elseya_ and\r\na few species of _Emydura_). In _Hydromedusa_ the nuchal is shut in by the\r\nanterior marginals, simulating a sixth neural. The plastron is composed of\r\nthe usual nine elements, but the Pelomedusidae possess an additional pair,\r\nthe meso-plastra, inserted between the hyo- and hypo-plastra. The bridge is\r\nstrong, connected with the carapace by suture. In _Sternothaerus_ the front\r\nlobe of the plastron is movable. The intergular shield is always present;\r\nit is terminal, forming part of the front margin, except in _Chelodina_,\r\nwhere this shield, although large, is shut in behind the gulars (cf. Fig.\r\n61, 4 and 5, p. 315).\r\n\r\nAlthough the Pleurodira are a peculiarly specialised group, one of the\r\noldest Chelonian fossils known seems to belong to them. _Proganochelys_,\r\nrepresented by a complete shell, nearly 2 feet long, has been found in the\r\nUpper Keuper Sandstone of Würtemberg. _Plesiochelys_, of the Upper Jurassic\r\nof Switzerland, has eight neural and three supracaudal plates, but is\r\nwithout the {390}ischiadic plastral ankylosis. _Pleurosternum_, of the\r\nEnglish and Continental Purbeck beds, has meso-plastral plates like the\r\nrecent Pelomedusidae. _Rhinochelys_, of the Cambridge Greensand, has a\r\nbroad parieto-postfrontal roof, and large nasal bones. Forms like\r\n_Podocnemis_, now restricted to South America, occur in the Eocene of\r\nEurope. One of the most aberrant Chelonians is _Miolania_, from the\r\nPlistocene of Queensland and from Lord Howe's Island, remarkable for its\r\nhuge size and the thick armour on the head and tail; the head especially\r\ncarries large paired projections, one pair of which extends horizontally\r\nlike powerful horns, recalling the queer Theromorphous _Elginia_.\r\n\r\nWe divide the recent Pleurodira into three families, of which that of\r\n_Carettochelys_ stands apart by its paddle-shaped limbs and the absence of\r\nhorny shields. The Pelomedusidae and Chelydidae are closely allied. The\r\nformer are not Australian, and are externally distinguished by the absence\r\nof a nuchal shield.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. PELOMEDUSIDAE.–Neck completely retractile within the shell.\r\nCarapace without a nuchal shield. The plastron is composed of eleven\r\nplates, there being besides the unpaired endo-plastron a pair of\r\nmeso-plastra, situated between the hyo- and hypo-plastra; but these\r\nmeso-plastra meet in the middle line in _Sternothaerus_ only, while in\r\n_Podocnemis_ and _Pelomedusa_ they are restricted to small pieces on the\r\nbridge, widely separated from each other by the usual hyo- and\r\nhypo-plastral suture. A nuchal shield is absent; there are twenty-four\r\nmarginal and thirteen plastral shields, inclusive of the conspicuous\r\nintergular. The temporal fossa is widely open, except in _Podocnemis_,\r\nwhere it is partly roofed in by the meeting of the much-expanded\r\nquadrato-jugal with the parietal. The palatine bones are in median contact,\r\nnot separated by the vomer. Nasal bones being absent, the large prefrontals\r\nmeet in the middle line. The second cervical vertebra is biconvex.\r\n\r\nThis family is now represented by only three genera, with about fifteen\r\nspecies in Africa, Madagascar, and South America.\r\n\r\n_Sternothaerus._–Skull without a bony supratemporal roof. Meso-plastra\r\nlarge, extending right across the plastron. Anterior lobe of the plastron\r\nmovable, the hinge passing between the hyo- and meso-plastral plates, and\r\nbetween the pectoral and abdominal shields. Fore- and hind-limbs with five\r\nshort digits and claws. Several species in tropical and southern Africa,\r\nand {391}in Madagascar. _S. derbianus_ in West Africa, from the Gambia to\r\nAngola, is the largest species, with a shell nearly one foot in length.\r\n\r\n_Pelomedusa._–Skull with a slender parieto-squamosal arch. Meso-plastra\r\nsmall and lateral. Plastron without a hinge. Fore- and hind-limbs with five\r\nvery short digits and five claws. Top of the head with one pair of shields\r\nbetween the eyes, and with a large interparietal and a pair of parietals\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n_P. galeata_, the only species, occurs in Madagascar and nearly the whole\r\nof Africa south of the Sahara, from the Cape to Abyssinia, and in the\r\nSinaitic peninsula. The shell, less than one foot in length, is much\r\ndepressed and is obtusely keeled; brown above with black spots;\r\nbrownish-yellow below. The short and broad head is coloured like the rest,\r\nwithout ornamentation. In Somaliland this species sleeps hidden on land\r\nduring the dry seasons, from July to the end of September, and from January\r\nto March, and appears at once after the rains have set in.\r\n\r\n_Podocnemis._–With a supratemporal roof formed by the junction of the\r\nparietal with the quadrato-jugal. Meso-plastra small and lateral. Fore- and\r\nhind-limbs broadly webbed, with five and four claws respectively. The\r\nfore-arms and the outer edges of the hind-feet with several conspicuous\r\nshields, hence the generic name. Head with an interparietal, two parietals,\r\nand a narrow unpaired shield between the eyes. The tail is very short. The\r\ncarapace is flat and broad, strongly serrated on the posterior margin. Chin\r\nwith one or two short barbels. Several species in South America, chiefly in\r\nthe basin of the Amazon, and one in Madagascar.\r\n\r\n_P. expansa._–Very common in Tropical South America, east of the Andes. The\r\nfemale, which is much larger than the male, has a shell nearly three feet\r\nin length. Olive-brown above with darker patches; yellowish below. With a\r\nfew yellow spots above and behind the eyes, and on the parietal region. The\r\n\"Arrau\" turtle is of great commercial importance on account of the eggs,\r\nwhich are periodically collected in enormous quantities, chiefly for the\r\noil. This is either eaten, like the eggs themselves, or used for burning in\r\nlamps, or as an addition to tar. The turtles are likewise eaten by man and\r\nbeast. Thousands of the little creatures are snapped up by Jabiru storks,\r\nalligators, and fishes; the adults fall an easy prey {392}to the prowling\r\njaguar, which turns them over on to their backs and neatly cleans out the\r\nflesh with its sharp and powerful claws.\r\n\r\nFertilisation takes place in the water, the eggs are deposited on land, in\r\nsand-banks, the female digging a hole about two feet deep and covering up\r\nthe numerous soft-shelled eggs with sand. The time of deposition is the\r\nearly hours of the morning, but the season depends upon the beginning of\r\nthe principal rains, since the young are hatched shortly before the\r\ntorrential rains. This season differs considerably in the various\r\ncountries. The hatching takes about forty days; the eggs are consequently\r\nlaid in the Amazon countries during the months of September to November, in\r\nthe Orinoco district in March. This species lives in the pools of the\r\ninundated forests, and when these are dried up, the animals retire into the\r\nrivers themselves. Their food consists mainly of the fruit dropping down\r\nfrom the trees.\r\n\r\nBates, in his delightful book, _The Naturalist on the River Amazon_, gives\r\nthe following lively and exhaustive account of his experience with these\r\nturtles:–\r\n\r\n\"I accompanied Cardozo in many wanderings on the Solimoes, during which we\r\nvisited the 'praias' (sand islands), the turtle pools in the forests, and\r\nthe by-streams and lakes of the great desert river. His object was mainly\r\nto superintend the business of digging up turtle eggs on the sandbanks,\r\nhaving been elected commandant for the year by the municipal council of\r\nEga, of the 'praia real' of Shimuni, the one lying nearest to Ega. There\r\nare four of these royal praias within the Ega district, a distance of 150\r\nmiles from the town, all of which are visited annually by the Ega people\r\nfor the purpose of collecting eggs and extracting oil from their yolks.\r\nEach has its commander, whose business is to make arrangements for securing\r\nto every inhabitant an equal chance in the egg harvest, by placing\r\nsentinels to protect the turtles whilst laying, and so forth. The pregnant\r\nturtles descend from the interior pools to the main river in July and\r\nAugust, before the outlets dry up, and there seek in countless swarms their\r\nfavourite sand-islands; for it is only a few praias that are selected by\r\nthem out of the great number existing. The young animals remain in the\r\npools throughout the dry season. These breeding places of turtles then lie\r\n20 to 30 or more feet above the level of the river, {393}and are accessible\r\nonly by cutting roads through the dense forest....\r\n\r\n\"We found the two sentinels lodged in a corner of the praia, where it\r\ncommences at the foot of the towering forest-wall of the island, having\r\nbuilt for themselves a little rancho with poles and palm-leaves. Great\r\nprecautions are obliged to be taken to avoid disturbing the sensitive\r\nturtles, who, previous to crawling ashore to lay, assemble in great shoals\r\noff the sand-bank. The men, during this time, take care not to show\r\nthemselves, and warn off any fisherman who wishes to pass near the\r\nplace....\r\n\r\n\"I rose from my hammock by daylight, shivering with cold; a praia, on\r\naccount of the great radiation of heat in the night from the sand, being\r\ntowards the dawn the coldest place that can be found in this climate.\r\nCardozo and the men were already up watching the turtles. The sentinels had\r\nerected for this purpose a stage about fifty feet high, on a tall tree near\r\ntheir station, the ascent to which was by a roughly made ladder of woody\r\nlianas. They are enabled, by observing the turtles from their watch-tower,\r\nto ascertain the date of successive deposits of eggs, and thus guide the\r\ncommandant in fixing the time for the general invitation to the Ega people.\r\n\r\n\"The turtles lay their eggs by night, leaving the water, when nothing\r\ndisturbs them, in vast crowds, and crawling to the central and highest part\r\nof the praia. These places are, of course, the last to go under water when,\r\nin unusually wet seasons, the river rises before the eggs are hatched by\r\nthe heat of the sand.... The hours between midnight and dawn are the\r\nbusiest. The turtles excavate with their broad webbed paws deep holes in\r\nthe fine sand; the first-comer, in each case, making a pit about three feet\r\ndeep, laying its eggs (about 120 in number), and covering them with sand;\r\nthe next making its deposit at the top of that of its predecessor, and so\r\non until every pit is full. The whole body of turtles frequenting a praia\r\ndoes not finish laying in less than fourteen or fifteen days, even when\r\nthere is no interruption. When all have done, the area (called by the\r\nBrazilians 'taboleiro') over which they have excavated is distinguishable\r\nfrom the rest of the praia only by signs of the sand having been a little\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\n\"I mounted the sentinel's stage just in time to see the turtles retreating\r\nto the water on the opposite side of the sand-bank, {394}after having laid\r\ntheir eggs. The sight was well worth the trouble of ascending the shaky\r\nladder. They were about a mile off, but the surface of the sands was\r\nblackened with the multitudes which were waddling towards the river; the\r\nmargin of the praia was rather steep, and they all seemed to tumble head\r\nfirst down the declivity into the water.... Placards were posted up on the\r\nchurch doors at Ega, announcing that the excavation on Shimuni would\r\ncommence on the 17th of October, and on Catuá, sixty miles below Shimuni,\r\non the 25th. By the morning of the 17th some 400 persons were assembled on\r\nthe borders of the sand-bank, each family having erected a rude temporary\r\nshed of poles and palm-leaves to protect themselves from the sun and rain.\r\nLarge copper kettles to prepare the oil, and hundreds of red earthenware\r\njars, were scattered about on the sand.\r\n\r\n\"The excavation of the taboleiro, collecting the eggs, and purifying the\r\noil, occupied four days. All was done on a system established by the old\r\nPortuguese governors, probably more than a century ago. The commandant\r\nfirst took down the names of all the masters of households, with the number\r\nof persons each intended to employ in digging; he then exacted a payment of\r\n140 reis (about 4d.) a head towards defraying the expense of sentinels. The\r\nwhole were then allowed to go to the taboleiro. They ranged themselves\r\nround the circle, each person armed with a paddle, to be used as a spade,\r\nand then all began simultaneously to dig on a signal being given–the roll\r\nof drums–by order of the commandant. It was an animating sight to behold\r\nthe wide circle of rival diggers throwing up clouds of sand in their\r\nenergetic labours, and working gradually towards the centre of the ring. A\r\nlittle rest was taken during the great heat of mid-day, and in the evening\r\nthe eggs were carried to the huts in baskets. By the end of the second day\r\nthe taboleiro was exhausted; large mounds of eggs, some of them four to\r\nfive feet in height, were then seen by the side of each hut, the produce of\r\nthe labour of the family.\r\n\r\n\"In the hurry of digging, some of the deeper nests are passed over; to find\r\nthese out, the people go about provided with a long steel or wooden probe,\r\nthe presence of the eggs being discoverable by the ease with which the spit\r\nenters the sand. When no more eggs are to be found, the mashing process\r\nbegins. {395}The egg, it may be here mentioned, has a flexible or leathery\r\nshell; it is quite round, and somewhat larger than a hen's egg. The whole\r\nheap is thrown into an empty canoe and mashed with wooden prongs; but\r\nsometimes naked Indians and children jump into the mass and tread it down,\r\nbesmearing themselves with yolk, and making about as filthy a scene as can\r\nwell be imagined. This being finished, water is poured into the canoe, and\r\nthe fatty mass is then left for a few hours to be heated by the sun, on\r\nwhich the oil separates and rises to the surface. The floating oil is\r\nafterwards skimmed off with long spoons, made by tying large mussel-shells\r\nto the end of rods, and purified over the fire in copper kettles.\r\n\r\n\"The destruction of turtle eggs every year by these proceedings is\r\nenormous. At least 6000 jars, holding each three gallons of the oil, are\r\nexported annually from the Upper Amazons and the Madeira to Para, where it\r\nis used for lighting, frying fish, and other purposes. It may be fairly\r\nestimated that 2000 more jarfuls are consumed by the inhabitants of the\r\nvillages on the river. Now, it takes twelve basketfuls of eggs, or about\r\n6000, by the wasteful process followed, to make one jar of oil. The total\r\nnumber of eggs annually destroyed amounts, therefore, to 48 millions. As\r\neach turtle lays about 120, it follows that the yearly offspring of 400,000\r\nturtles is thus annihilated. A vast number, nevertheless, remain\r\nundetected; and these would probably be sufficient to keep the turtle\r\npopulation of these rivers up to the mark, if the people did not follow the\r\nwasteful practice of lying in wait for the newly-hatched young, and\r\ncollecting them by thousands for eating; their tender flesh, and the\r\nremains of yolk in their entrails, being considered a great delicacy. The\r\nchief natural enemies of the turtle are vultures and alligators, which\r\ndevour the newly-hatched young as they descend in shoals to the water.\r\nThese must have destroyed an immensely greater number before the European\r\nsettlers began to appropriate the eggs than they do now. It is almost\r\ndoubtful if this natural persecution did not act as effectively in checking\r\nthe increase of the turtle as the artificial destruction now does. If we\r\nare to believe the tradition of the Indians, however, it had not this\r\nresult; for they say that formerly the waters teemed as thickly with\r\nturtles as the air does now with mosquitoes. The universal {396}opinion of\r\nthe settlers on the Upper Amazon is, that the turtle has very greatly\r\ndecreased in numbers, and is still annually decreasing.\r\n\r\n\"The principal object of another expedition was to search certain pools in\r\nthe forest for young turtle. We started from the praia at sunrise on the\r\n7th of October in two canoes, containing twenty-three persons, nineteen of\r\nwhom were Indians. The pool covered an area of about four or five acres,\r\nand was closely hemmed in by the forest, which, in picturesque variety and\r\ngrouping of trees and foliage, exceeded almost everything I had yet\r\nwitnessed. The margins for some distance were swampy, and covered with\r\nlarge tufts of fine grass. The pool was nowhere more than five feet deep,\r\none foot of which was not water, but extremely fine and soft mud.\r\n\r\n\"Cardozo and I spent an hour paddling about. The Indians seemed to think\r\nthat netting the animals, as Cardozo proposed doing, was not lawful sport,\r\nand wished first to have an hour or two's old-fashioned practice with their\r\nweapons. I was astonished at the skill which they displayed in shooting\r\nturtles from little stages made of poles and cross pieces of wood. They did\r\nnot wait for their coming to the surface to breathe, but watched for the\r\nslight movements in the water which revealed their presence underneath.\r\nThese little tracts on the water are called the siriré; the instant one was\r\nperceived an arrow flew from the bow of the nearest man, and never failed\r\nto pierce the shell of the submerged animal. When the turtle was very\r\ndistant, of course the aim had to be taken at a considerable elevation, but\r\nthe marksmen preferred a longish range, because the arrow then fell more\r\nperpendicularly on the shell, and entered it more deeply.\r\n\r\n\"The arrow used in turtle-shooting has a strong lancet-shaped steel point\r\nfitted into a peg, which enters the tip of the shaft. The peg is secured to\r\nthe shaft by twine, being some thirty or forty yards in length, and neatly\r\nwound round the body of the arrow. When the missile enters the shell the\r\npeg drops out, and the pierced animal descends with it towards the bottom,\r\nleaving the shaft floating on the surface. This being done the sportsman\r\npaddles in his canoe to the place, and gently draws the animal by the\r\ntwine, humouring it by giving it the rein when it plunges, until it is\r\nbrought again near the surface, when {397}he strikes it with a second\r\narrow. With the increased hold given by the two cords he has then no\r\ndifficulty in landing his game.\r\n\r\n\"By mid-day the men had shot about a score of nearly full-grown turtles.\r\nCardozo then gave orders to spread the net.... Three boat loads, or about\r\neighty, were secured in about twenty minutes. They were then taken ashore\r\nand each one secured by the men tying the legs with thongs of bast.\r\n\r\n\"When the canoes had been twice filled we desisted after a very hard day's\r\nwork. Nearly all the animals were young ones, chiefly, according to the\r\nstatement of Pedro, from three to ten years of age; they varied from 6 to\r\n18 inches in length, and were very fat. Cardozo and I lived almost\r\nexclusively on them for several months afterwards. Roasted in the shell\r\nthey form a most appetising dish. These younger turtles never migrate with\r\ntheir elders on the sinking of the waters, but remain in the tepid pools,\r\nfattening on fallen fruits, and, according to the natives, on the fine\r\nnutritious mud. We captured a few full-grown mother turtles, which were\r\nknown at once by the horny skin of their breast plates being worn, telling\r\nof their having crawled on the sand to lay eggs the previous year. They had\r\nevidently made a mistake in not leaving the pool at the proper time, for\r\nthey were full of eggs, which, we were told, they would, before the season\r\nwas over, scatter in despair over the swamp. We also found several male\r\nturtles, or capitaris, as they are called by the natives. These are\r\nimmensely less numerous than the females, and are distinguishable by their\r\nmuch smaller size, more circular shape, and the greater length and\r\nthickness of their tails. Their flesh is considered unwholesome, especially\r\nto sick people having external signs of inflammation.\"\r\n\r\nThe most recent account of these water tortoises is that published by Dr.\r\nGoeldi from the MS. of João Martins da Silva Continho, a former resident at\r\nManáos on the Middle Amazon. The \"Tartaruga\" (the Portuguese name for\r\nturtles) live from January to July in the inundated, quiet backwaters of\r\nthe forest-region, feeding upon the various seeds of palms as these ripen\r\nand drop successively; rarely, and only when hard up, they are carnivorous.\r\nThe creatures hide under water below the trees, when they are espied by the\r\nIndians, who dive down to a depth of twenty and more feet to catch them in\r\ntheir arms. The {398}civilised Indians use a steel-pointed lance of hard\r\nwood, about 10 feet in length. A string connects the point with the shaft\r\naround which it is wound. When stuck into the tortoise the shaft and point\r\npart; the string is either tied to the boat or to a little float of light\r\nwood. In other districts an arrow with a string is employed.\r\n\r\nIn August, when the water subsides, the tortoises return to the rivers, and\r\nthe entrance of the lagoon is closed with nets. A number of boats with long\r\npoles drive them with much noise towards the entrance. On their way to the\r\nrivers the tortoises always go up-stream, and this is called the \"arribaçaõ\r\ndas tartarugas,\" the ascent of the turtles. The fishermen post themselves\r\nat shallow spots or on sand-banks, and wait for the creatures which come up\r\nto find a place for landing and laying. The arrows employed are called\r\n_sararaca_, _i.e._ a thing which can be disjointed; they are about 4 feet\r\nlong, and consist of a _gomo_ or internodium of wood 9 inches long with a\r\none- or two-barbed steel point, and the shaft into which the _gomo_ fits\r\nloosely. The _gomo_ is, moreover, connected with the shaft by a string made\r\nof palm-fibres about 30 feet in length, partly wound round the shaft, which\r\nultimately acts as a float.\r\n\r\nThe laying takes place from the end of September into October. Some of the\r\nparents seem to reconnoitre on land for a few days. As a rule only females\r\ndo this, and the natives say that they are led by a \"_mestra_.\" The laying\r\ntakes place early in the morning. The number of females is so great that\r\nthey often block the way of the boats, and make a great noise by knocking\r\nagainst their neighbours' shells. Each digs a hole about 18 inches or 2\r\nfeet deep, and lays from 80 to 200 eggs. Sometimes the laying individual is\r\nentirely buried by its neighbours which are scraping their own holes.\r\n\r\nIn some districts the eggs are wanted for \"manteiga\" (Portuguese for\r\nbutter); and the turning over, or _viraçaõ_ of the tortoises takes place\r\nlater. In other districts they are caught before the eggs are laid, and\r\nthis barbaric and destructive custom was formerly forbidden by the people\r\nthemselves. Although the provincial assembly tried to reinstitute the old\r\nreasonable customs, the inspectors are often got over by bribery.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of extracting the oil from the eggs. To get the thick\r\noil used, mixed with tar, for shipbuilding, caulking, {399}etc., the eggs\r\nare heaped up for five days and then worked. The fluid oil for lighting is\r\nmade from fresh eggs, which are put into a boat and then trampled out with\r\nthe feet. The oil is drawn off into large earthen jars and put on the fire.\r\nThen it is rapidly cooled. The best oil, used for frying fish, is that\r\nwhich is gained from the roasted tortoises themselves. Fresh eggs are\r\neither fried or taken with sugar, or mixed with manioca-flour and water.\r\nThe young, which are hatched in January, are likewise eaten fried, or they\r\nare preserved in the fat of the parents.\r\n\r\nAn average tortoise yields 5 lbs. of fat, costing on the spot two milreis.\r\nThe whole full-grown animal, of one yard in length, costs the same, and its\r\nmeat is sufficient to sustain a family of six people for three days. To\r\nmake 24 lbs. of oil requires 3000 eggs. Two or three tortoises would yield\r\nthe same amount from their fat. Consequently the destruction of the eggs\r\ncauses an enormous waste, and is after all the least economical procedure.\r\nIn the year 1719, 192,000 lbs. were exported from the Alto Amazonas,\r\nrepresenting 24,000,000 eggs. In 1700 there were still plenty of tortoises\r\n50 leagues above the mouth of the Para river. Now there is no assembly of\r\nmore than fifteen tortoises to be found anywhere within 300 leagues from\r\nPara to the mouth of the Rio Negro. On the Rio Madeira, from the mouth to\r\nthe first cataract, 186 leagues distance, there are now only two regular\r\nnesting localities. The upper Solimoes and the Rio Yapura are still rich.\r\nNear Ega are regular tortoise-ponds, called \"curral,\" which yield\r\nsufficient support to their owners; the animals are fed with manioca-flour\r\nand leguminous plants.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. CHELYDIDAE.–The neck bends under the margin of the carapace, but\r\nremains partly exposed. The nuchal shield is absent except in two Northern\r\nAustralian species. There are twelve pairs of marginal shields. The\r\nplastron is composed of nine plates, and is covered with thirteen shields,\r\none of which is the conspicuous intergular. The temporal region of the\r\nskull shows great diversity. It is quite open in _Chelodina_, covered in by\r\nbroad expansions of the parietal bones in _Platemys_, _Emydura_, and\r\n_Elseya_, or bridged over by a parieto-squamosal arch, which is very\r\nslender in _Rhinemys_, strong in _Chelys_ and _Hydraspis_. The palatine\r\nbones are separated by the vomer; the nasals are variable, mostly present,\r\nbut the prefrontals are always small, and separated {400}by the frontals.\r\nThe fifth and eighth cervical vertebrae are biconvex.\r\n\r\nThis family, still represented by nearly thirty species, which are divided\r\ninto eight genera, is restricted to Notogaea, namely, South America and\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.–Skull of _Chelys fimbriata_. × 1.

Besides the nuchal,\r\nthere are seven neural plates; the last pair of costals form a median\r\nsuture. Nasal bones are absent. The jaws are very weak. The Matamata has a\r\nvery peculiar appearance. The nose is produced into a long, soft tube, at\r\nthe end of which open the tiny nostrils. The eyes are very small, and the\r\norbits are placed very near the anterior end of the skull, while the\r\nparietal {401}region is broad and much elongated (Fig. 87, p. 400). The\r\nquadrates are drawn out into trumpet-shaped tubes. The hyoid apparatus is\r\nvery large, with enormous anterior and posterior horns. The head and neck\r\nare as long as or even longer than the carapace, which is covered with\r\nthick, lumpy shields. The skin of the thick neck, of the sides and under\r\nparts of the head, is produced into many soft arborescent excrescences or\r\nfimbriae, those of the chin and throat and the large ear-flaps being\r\nmovable at will, and probably used to attract fishes and other prey. The\r\ntail is very short. The fore- and hind-limbs are webbed, the former with\r\nfive, the latter with four claws. Old specimens, which reach a total length\r\nof three feet, are uniformly dark brown, and look like a log covered with\r\nrough bark. The young are far less ugly, with black and yellow spots on the\r\nshell, and with dark stripes along the neck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.–_Chelys fimbriata_ (\"Matamata\"). × ⅒.]\r\n\r\nVery little is known about the habits of this peculiar creature. It is said\r\nto lie submerged in the water, waiting for fishes, frogs, or tadpoles,\r\nwhich are attracted by the playing motions of its cutaneous excrescences.\r\nThe jaws being so weak, and being covered with a partly soft lip-like skin,\r\nit is probable that they are not used for seizing the prey, but that the\r\nlatter is engulfed into the mouth with the inrush of water into the throat.\r\n{402}That this can be widened enormously is indicated by the greatly\r\ndeveloped hyoid apparatus.\r\n\r\n_Chelodina._–The neck is long and slender, the head small and smooth. The\r\nnuchal is terminal; the intergular is large. The neural plates are\r\ncompletely suppressed, all the eight pairs of costal plates meeting in the\r\nmiddle line. The shell is very flat. Anterior and posterior limbs entirely\r\nwebbed, and with only four claws. The tail is very short. Three species in\r\nAustralia, one in New Guinea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.–_Chelodina longicollis._ × ⅓.]\r\n\r\n_Ch. longicollis_ reaches a shell-length of ten inches. It inhabits\r\nSouthern Australia. The illustrations make a detailed description\r\nunnecessary. The colour of the dorsal shield is uniformly dark rich brown,\r\nwhile the shields of the under surface are yellow, with broad dark brown\r\nlines along the sutures. These \"long-necked Chelodines\" have a striking\r\nappearance, when they swim or creep about, with the neck either stretched\r\nout straight or bent horizontally in an S-shape. The whole creature looks\r\nneat and elegant; the iris is pale yellow, and gives the eye a very\r\nintelligent expression. They keep well in captivity, provided they are\r\ngiven the choice of land and water. My own prefer to spend most of the day\r\non land, preferably under the ledge of a stone, or perched upon the stone\r\nitself if the latter is in the shade, and not too much exposed to view.\r\nThere they lie motionless, with the neck neatly tucked under the shell,\r\neither to the right or to the left. Although the eyelids may be closed,\r\nthey can see well enough, owing to the transparent condition of the lower\r\nlid. They feed in the water upon soft animals, as for instance worms,\r\nsmooth caterpillars, cockroaches or little frogs; and they also take meat\r\nreadily, provided this is moved about. The food is invariably taken with a\r\nquick sideward jerk of the neck and head.\r\n\r\n{403}[Illustration: FIG. 90.–_Chelodina longicollis_ (Australian\r\nlong-necked Chelodines). × ¼.]\r\n\r\nMy specimens soon became so tame that they left the water, and ran up to me\r\nwith the necks stretched to their full length, then snatching the bit of\r\nfood, and retiring into the pond to swallow it. When left to themselves\r\nthey are rather nocturnal in their feeding habits. Now and then they tuck\r\nthemselves away for weeks without feeding, for instance when they go\r\nthrough a regular term of {404}aestivation in the summer. The last winter\r\nthey spent buried in the moss, but occasionally, especially on bright and\r\nsunny days, they went into the water for a few hours, chiefly to drink, but\r\nsometimes also to take a little food.\r\n\r\n_Hydromedusa_, a South American genus, has a neck even longer than that of\r\n_Chelodina_, which it much resembles externally. But the nuchal shield,\r\nlarge and broad transversely, is situated behind the anterior marginals,\r\nlooking therefore like a sixth neural shield. The neural plates form a\r\ncontinuous row, only the last pair of costal plates meeting in the middle\r\nline. _H. tectifera_ occurs in Southern Brazil, and in the La Plata. The\r\nshell is dark brown above; yellowish, with dark spots, below; the head and\r\nneck are olive-coloured, adorned with a broad white, black-edged band on\r\neither side. Fore- and hind-limbs broadly webbed, and with four claws.\r\nTotal length of the shell about eight inches.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. CARETTOCHELYDIDAE.–The shell is covered with soft skin instead of\r\nhorny shields. The limbs are transformed into paddles, with elongated\r\ndigits, and have only two claws. The neck is short, and not retractile. In\r\nother respects the skeleton, notably the plastron, pelvis, and skull,\r\nconform with the Pleurodirous type. Only one species, _Carettochelys\r\ninsculpta_, still imperfectly known, from the Fly River, New Guinea. Length\r\nof the shell of the only complete specimen about 18 inches. This peculiar\r\ncreature seems to stand in the same relation to the typical Pleurodira, as\r\ndo the Chelonidae to the Testudinidae, except for the complete reduction of\r\nthe horny shields upon the shell, recalling in this respect _Sphargis_ and\r\n_Trionyx_.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 3. TRIONYCHOIDEA.–The shell is very flat, oval, or almost round,\r\nand is covered with soft, leathery skin instead of with horny shields. The\r\nlimbs are broadly webbed, and only the three inner digits are provided with\r\nclaws. Carnivorous, found in the rivers of Asia, Africa, and North America.\r\n\r\nThe head and neck are completely retractile, bending by a sigmoid curve in\r\na vertical plane like that of the Cryptodira. The jaws are concealed by\r\nsoft, lip-like flaps, and the nose forms a soft short proboscis. The ear is\r\nhidden. The skull, Fig. 91, is flat, with three long posterior processes,\r\nformed by the supra-occipital above, and the squamosals on either side. The\r\nwhole temporal region forms a wide, shallow fossa, without any\r\n{405}indication of being arched or bridged over. The premaxilla is\r\nextremely small, unpaired, not even reaching the nasal cavity or the vomer.\r\nThe maxillaries are correspondingly enlarged, surrounding the choanae,\r\nwhich are separated by the narrow vomer. The palatines form a median\r\nsuture, and are joined behind by the long basisphenoid, which separates the\r\nlong pterygoids from each other. The quadrate is trumpet-shaped, with a\r\nposterior notch for the stapes. The zygomatic arch is complete, and is\r\nformed by the quadrato-jugal and the jugal; the latter joins the maxillary\r\nand postfrontal, mostly reaching the orbit; in some cases it also just\r\nmeets the parietal, thereby adding to the strength of the postorbital arch.\r\nThe prefrontals are large; nasals are absent. The mandible is remarkable\r\nfor the great development of the coronoid process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.–Skull of _Trionyx hurum_. _A_, From above; _B_,\r\nfrom the left side; _Cond_, occipital condyle; _Fr_, frontal; _J_, _Jug_,\r\njugal; _L.o_, lateral occipital; _Max_, maxillary; _Op.o_, opisthotic;\r\n_Par_, parietal; _Pr.f_, prefrontal; _Pro_, prootic; _Pt.f_, postfrontal;\r\n_Q_, quadrate; _Qj_, quadrato-jugal; _S.o_, supra-occipital; _Sq_,\r\nsquamosal.]\r\n\r\nThe pubic and ischiadic bones enclose a large heart-shaped foramen, and are\r\nfree from the plastron; the ilia are attached only to the sacral ribs. The\r\ncarapace is peculiar in so far as it is very incomplete peripherally, the\r\nribs extending considerably beyond the costal plates, nor are they joined\r\nby marginal plates, which are absent, unless they are represented by a few\r\nsmall ossifications imbedded in the posterior marginal flap of the disc\r\n(_Emyda_ of India). The rim of the disc is always formed by a horizontal,\r\ncutaneous, very flexible flap. All the dorsal plates have a rough upper\r\nsurface, vermiculated or rugose, as usual with such dermal bones, which\r\nhave lost most of or all their horny covering, and have sunk more deeply\r\ninto the skin. The {406}nuchal plate has usually a pair of rib-like\r\nprocesses. The neurals form a continuous series, except in the African\r\n_Cyclanorbis_, in which they are much reduced in size, and separated by the\r\ncostal plates.\r\n\r\nThe plastron is imperfect, all its constituent nine elements being only\r\nloosely connected with each other, and there remains a wide median vacuity\r\nbetween the lateral elements. Most of these plastral bones are reduced to\r\nsplints, which, instead of meeting by regular sutures, loosely\r\ninterdigitate with their jagged edges. In the young all these ventral\r\nelements are deeply imbedded in the soft, leathery skin, and they do not at\r\nall resemble in appearance those of the dorsal side. With age they develop\r\nupon their ventral surface stronger and denser ossifications, which\r\nultimately broaden out, sometimes beyond the original underlying bone, and\r\nassume the characteristic vermiculated surface-appearance. This is\r\nundoubtedly a process of exostosis, a step towards revival of that armour\r\nwhich had been much reduced ancestrally. To appreciate this condition, it\r\nis at least suggestive that these mud-tortoises, when kept in the usual\r\nhard-bottomed tanks, invariably become sore, the skin wearing through where\r\nthe imbedded plastral bones touch the ground. Thus what is crammed into the\r\nshort life of a captive individual, is in the natural course of events\r\nspread over many generations, whereby it has ceased to be pathological, and\r\nhas become a comparatively new, tertiary, but regular feature.\r\n\r\nIt is not open to much doubt that the characteristic features of the\r\nTrionychoidea are not primitive but secondary. This is indicated by the\r\nwhole structure and behaviour of the carapace and plastron. The softening\r\nof the whole shell, the loss of the horny shields, the reduction of the\r\nclaws, are the direct and almost unavoidable results of life in muddy\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nGeologically they do not seem to be very old. They appear, already\r\nreferable to the genus _Trionyx_, in the Upper Cretaceous strata of North\r\nAmerica. In the Lower and Middle Tertiary strata many species existed in\r\nNorth America and in Europe, and it is of great importance that in these\r\nspecies the costal plates were much broader, and the marginal plates better\r\ndeveloped, than in the recent forms. Now their half-dozen genera, with\r\nabout twenty-four species, are confined to North America, the tropical and\r\nwarmer parts of Asia, and the Malay {407}Islands, and to Africa from the\r\nNile to the Senegal and to the Congo.\r\n\r\nThe habits of Trionychoidea have found few observers. According to L.\r\nAgassiz,[138] they live in the muddy bottom of shallow waters, burying\r\nthemselves in the soft mud, with only the head, or a small part of it,\r\nexposed. They breathe without moving the body, by raising up the long neck\r\nand carrying the leathery snout above water. When moving through the water\r\nthey strike horizontally with both pairs of limbs, alternating, however,\r\nthe right and left; but when they start suddenly, the front limbs are seen\r\nmoving together towards the tip of the snout, and then striking\r\nsimultaneously backward with great power. As the shield does not project\r\nforward, the fore-limbs usually move beyond the shield, and as its outer\r\nedge is sharp, and the feet are broad, their webs reach above as well as\r\nbelow the plane of that edge, so that the water is driven partly over and\r\npartly under it. When they move along the bottom, the limbs still move\r\nhorizontally, the webs striking against the water, and the inner toes,\r\nthose with the claws, against the bottom. They also bury themselves\r\nhorizontally, becoming covered by only a thin layer of mud. They readily\r\nresort to the shell for protection. The neck and head are withdrawn\r\nentirely, the loose skin rolling off from the greater part of the neck; and\r\nthe skin of the legs also slips off, as far as the elbows and knees. In\r\nconfinement they exhibit great quickness; their movements are abrupt and\r\nunsteady, except when they swim rapidly in one direction. They then dart\r\ntheir long and slender neck quickly forwards or sideways and upwards, as\r\nsnakes do, and bite in the same way, striking suddenly. Their temper is bad\r\nor even ferocious, and large specimens are quite dangerous.\r\n\r\nTheir food consists of all sorts of aquatic animals, fish, frogs, and\r\nmolluscs, for instance _Anodonta_ and _Paludina_. According to the\r\ndifferent diet, many species develop a peculiar kind of dimorphism, a\r\nreasonable explanation of which has been given by Boulenger. In the young\r\nthe horny coverings of the jaws are sharp, with cutting edges, and in those\r\nspecimens which keep to a diet of fish and other soft creatures, the jaws\r\nremain in the same condition. But in those which take to living upon\r\nmolluscs, the hard shells of which they have to crush, the horny edges are\r\n{408}worn down; and broad, thick, horny, crushing pads are developed in\r\ntheir stead, the supporting parts of the jaws becoming more massive. The\r\nmasticatory muscles are likewise enlarged, and a tubercle grows upon the\r\nlower border of the jugal bone, whence arises part of the masseter muscle.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are round, thick-shelled, but very brittle; they are laid in the\r\nsand above the level of the water, and this is the chief occasion on which\r\nthese tortoises creep on land.\r\n\r\n_Trionyx._–The plastron has no special cutaneous valves for the concealment\r\nof the hind-limbs. This is the principal genus, with the greatest number of\r\nspecies and the widest distribution, the latter coinciding with that of the\r\nwhole family. The upper surface of the shell of young specimens frequently\r\nforms numerous longitudinal ridges or series of little horny tubercles\r\nwhich disappear with age.\r\n\r\n_T. ferox_, the commonest \"Soft-shelled Turtle\" of the United States. Olive\r\nabove with scattered, small, round, black spots; young with conical,\r\nspine-like tubercles, especially on the nuchal border and on the posterior\r\nportion of the shell, which has a pale, black-edged border. A light,\r\nblack-edged streak passes through the eye and joins its fellow on the\r\nsnout. The limbs are olive brown, spotted and marbled with black. The under\r\nparts of the shell are white. Very large specimens have a shell 18 inches\r\nin length and 16 inches wide. Holbrook gives the following account of its\r\nhabits:–\r\n\r\n\"A voracious, carnivorous creature. They reside most constantly in the\r\nwater, swim with rapidity, and choose for their retreat holes under the\r\nbanks of rivers, or under rocks; and not unfrequently the trunk of some\r\nhuge forest tree, fallen into the stream, affords them shelter. Sometimes\r\nthey leave the water and conceal themselves in the mud: I have frequently\r\nseen them thus buried to the depth of 2 or 3 inches, leaving only a small\r\nbreathing hole for the long neck and narrow head, which is occasionally\r\nthrust out, but most commonly it is retracted so that one would pass near\r\nwithout observing their habitation; and if seen, it might easily be\r\nmistaken for the residence of some large insect. At other times they may be\r\nseen in numbers on rocks in shallow water, basking in the sun, apparently\r\nasleep. They bite severely when provoked, darting forward with great\r\nvelocity the long neck and head, and not unfrequently spring upward at the\r\nsame time and make a loud hiss.\r\n\r\n{409}[Illustration: FIG. 92.–_Trionyx ferox_ (American Soft-shelled\r\nTurtle). × ⅒.]\r\n\r\nIn the month of May the females seek sandy places along the banks of the\r\nwaters they inhabit to lay their eggs, generally about sixty in number; and\r\nit is remarkable that, though their motions are slow and difficult on dry\r\nland, yet at this season they sometimes mount hillocks several feet high.\r\nThe flesh affords the most delicate food, surpassing that even of the Green\r\nTurtle. The geographical distribution is interesting. It inhabits the\r\nSavannah as well as all those rivers that empty into the northern borders\r\nof the Gulf of Mexico; it ascends up the broad Mississippi, and is found in\r\nall its tributaries, even to the very foot of the Rocky Mountains; it\r\nabounds in the chain of great northern lakes both above and below the Falls\r\nof Niagara, and is common in the Mohawk, a tributary of the {410}Hudson\r\nriver; but it is not found in any other Atlantic stream between that and\r\nthe Savannah river, a distance of nearly 800 miles.\"\r\n\r\n_T. triunguis_, the only African species, ranging from the Senegal and\r\nCongo into the Nile-system, but occurring also in Syria, is perhaps the\r\nlargest of all Trionychidae, reaching a shell-length of almost 3 feet. The\r\nadults are olive-brownish above, the throat and under parts of the shell\r\nwith round, white spots separated by a dark network. The young have whitish\r\nspecks and spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.–_Trionyx gangeticus_ (young). × ⅓.]\r\n\r\n_T. gangeticus_ and _T. hurum_ are the principal Indian species. The former\r\nis the larger of the two, with a shell of more than 2 feet in length; olive\r\nabove, the young with fine black vermiculations; head with a black\r\nlongitudinal streak from between the eyes to the nape, intersected by two\r\nor three chevron-shaped black streaks; under parts yellowish. _T. hurum_ is\r\nolive brown above {411}and below, in younger specimens with conspicuous,\r\nlarge, yellow spots on the sides of the head. The young are ornamented with\r\ntwo or three pairs of large round spots on the back, and the same applies\r\nto the beautiful young of the Burmese, _T. formosa_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.–_Trionyx formosa_ (young). × 1.]\r\n\r\nThe three genera, _Cycloderma_ and _Cyclanorbis_ of Tropical Africa, and\r\n_Emyda_ of India, have a pair of cutaneous femoral valves or flaps on the\r\nplastron, beneath which the hind-limbs are withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{412}CHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDINOSAURIA–CROCODILIA\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS V.–DINOSAURIA._\r\n\r\n  _Mesozoic, long-tailed, toothed reptiles, with distal ischiadic\r\n  symphysis, terrestrial limbs, large fixed quadrate bones and bifurcated\r\n  ribs._\r\n\r\nThe Dinosaurs begin and end with the Mesozoic epoch, and have a world-wide\r\ndistribution. The name, \"terrible Reptiles,\" refers to the gigantic\r\nproportions which many of them attained, not a few of them surpassing in\r\nsize and shape the fantastic pictures of the dragons of our fables.\r\nAlthough these creatures came to an end millions of years before the first\r\nman-like beings appeared, it is reasonable to suppose that the\r\nwidely-spread myths of dragons are based upon the accidentally disclosed\r\nskeletons of these monsters.\r\n\r\nThe skull is built after a plan which may be derived from a combination of\r\nthe Crocodilian and Rhynchocephalian skulls, but the detail varies\r\nconsiderably in the many and much diversified members of this large\r\nsub-class. There is as a rule a pre-orbital foramen, which is smallest in\r\nthe Ornithopoda. The orbit is completely encircled by bones, and the\r\ntemporal fossa is divided by a squamoso-postfrontal or post-orbital bridge\r\ninto a smaller supra-, and a much wider infra-temporal portion, the latter\r\nbeing bordered below by the jugal and quadrato-jugal, and this is firmly\r\nconnected with the quadrate by an ascending process. The quadrate is long,\r\nmore or less vertical in position, slanting either forwards or backwards,\r\nand firmly fixed above by the squamosal, perhaps also by a supra-temporal\r\nbone. The orbit is bordered by the jugal, lacrymal, pre- and post-frontals.\r\nThe interparietal foramen seems to be {413}abolished. Teeth, mostly\r\nalveolar and laterally compressed, are restricted to the dentary,\r\nmaxillary, and premaxillary bones. In the Orthopoda the latter carry no\r\nteeth, or these are restricted to the lateral portion, leaving a wide\r\ndiastema. This toothless part plays upon a peculiar crescent-shaped bone,\r\nthe so-called predentary, which rests loosely upon the anterior ends of the\r\nmandibular rami, which latter do not as a rule form an osseous symphysis.\r\nThe Ceratopsia possess in addition a similar upper toothless piece, the\r\nprerostral, a kind of pre-premaxilla. The morphological value of these\r\nextra pieces is quite obscure; they were in all probability provided with\r\nthick, horny pads. The bones of the roof of the mouth recall in their\r\narrangement that prevailing in the Rhynchocephalia and the Parasuchia.\r\nThere are two pairs of large vacuities; one between the maxillae,\r\nectopterygoids and palatines; the other between the latter, the maxillae\r\nand the usually small or slender vomers. The pterygoids are perhaps the\r\nlargest bones, and form a rather long symphysis; laterally and behind they\r\nabut against the quadrate, anteriorly against the ectopterygoids and the\r\npalatines, which latter they sometimes separate. A peculiar feature of some\r\nskulls, _e.g._ _Ceratosaurus_ and _Triceratops_ is the great size of the\r\ngroove in which the large hypophysis of the brain is lodged.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are very variable, amphicoelous, opisthocoelous, nearly\r\nplain, with a slight concavity behind, or occasionally procoelous in the\r\nanterior region of the tail. Besides the usual pre- and post-zygapophyses\r\nmany Sauropoda and Theropoda possess on the posterior trunk-vertebrae\r\nadditional joints, effected by a vertical wedge, the hyposphene, which\r\nextends backwards from between the post-zygapophyses and fits into a notch\r\nbetween and below the anterior zygapophyses of the next following vertebra.\r\nThese additional articulations are analogous to the zygosphenes and\r\nzygantra of snakes and iguanas, except that in these Sauria the wedges are\r\nformed on the opposite, namely the anterior ends of the vertebrae. The\r\nvertebrae of the neck and trunk are devoid of intercentra, but those of the\r\ntail carry long chevron-bones. The number of sacral vertebrae is generally\r\nincreased to four or five. The ribs have well-developed capitula and\r\ntubercula, and the former have the tendency to shift from the centra or\r\nfrom their parapophysial processes on to the usually much elongated\r\ndiapophyses of the neural arches. This {414}arrangement, recalling the\r\nCrocodilian condition, results in an increased capacity of the dorsal\r\nportion of the body-cavity. Intervertebral articulation of the ribs does\r\nnot occur except sometimes in the sacral region. Abdominal ribs are rare,\r\nbut they occur in some of the Theropoda, _e.g._ in _Compsognathus_.\r\n\r\nThe sternum seems to have been mainly cartilaginous, with a pair of\r\nirregular, disc-shaped ossifications. How the coracoids were attached is\r\nunknown; they are small, generally with a foramen, but the scapulae are\r\nalways very strong and slant backwards. Clavicles and interclavicles seem\r\nto be absent.\r\n\r\nThe fore-limbs are as a rule powerful, although often much shorter than the\r\nhind-limbs, which are then enormously developed, and in many genera of two\r\nof the main groups show a tendency towards a semi-erect gait. Some of the\r\nDinosaurs, e.g. _Iguanodon_ and _Brontozoum_, were absolutely bipedal.\r\nOthers seem to have hopped like Kangaroos. In correlation with this more or\r\nless erect mode of progression the iliac bones are very strong, much\r\nelongated horizontally, and attached to more than three, often to five or\r\neven more, vertebrae. The pubic bones show two main types. Each consists\r\neither of a single strong shaft, which is connected distally with its\r\nfellow; or (Orthopoda) this main shaft sends out, below its point of\r\ncontact with the ischium, a long process, the so-called post-pubis, which\r\nis directed downwards and backwards. In the latter case it runs parallel\r\nand in close contact with the ischium. Such bifurcated pubic bones never\r\nmeet in the middle line. The ischia, on the other hand, are always\r\nconnected with each other, not so much by fusion as by syndesmosis.\r\n\r\nThe hind-limbs exhibit all stages from a simple, plantigrade and five-toed\r\nstate to a decidedly digitigrade, four, and even three-toed arrangement.\r\nMany genera exhibit the tendency to form an intertarsal joint, a feature\r\nelsewhere known in birds only, where it is typical and universal. The\r\nastragalus sends up an ascending process which tends to fuse with the\r\nanterior aspect of the distal end of the tibia, and the calcaneum is\r\nsometimes more or less firmly attached to the fibula. In _Compsognathus_\r\neven the distal tarsalia have begun to fuse with the metatarsalia, so that\r\nthis reptile at least has a typical intertarsal joint. The femur is\r\nremarkable for the frequent possession of a \"fourth\" trochanter on the\r\nmiddle of the inner aspect of the shaft, undoubtedly {415}for the insertion\r\nof the long caudi-femoral or long adductor muscle.\r\n\r\nMany Dinosaurs possess hollow instead of solid bones. The vertebrae have\r\nlarge cavities in the Sauropoda, notably in _Brontosaurus_; in many\r\nTheropoda, e.g. _Coelurus_, _Anchisaurus_, _Compsognathus_, the limb-bones\r\nand the vertebrae are hollow, the latter being reduced to thin-walled\r\nshells with a few inner partitions, the bones being at the same time much\r\nswollen and enlarged. In the Ornithopoda the vertebrae are solid, but the\r\nlimb-bones are hollow. The reason of this hollowing out is not easily\r\nfound. Undoubtedly it results in a saving of material and weight, whilst at\r\nthe same time, without loss of strength, the surfaces for the attachment of\r\nthe necessarily powerful muscles are increased. But _Compsognathus_ is a\r\nsmall, _Brontozoum_ a gigantic, creature. On the other hand, the bones of\r\nthe huge Stegosauri are solid. Most probably these cavities were, as in\r\nbirds, filled with air-sacs ultimately in communication with the lungs; and\r\nit is by no means a baseless suggestion of Haeckel's that the Dinosaurs\r\nwere warm-blooded. Their mode of propagation can only be guessed at from\r\nthe circumstance that a rather well-preserved specimen of _Compsognathus_\r\ncontains in its abdomen what may possibly be an embryo. There is nothing\r\nagainst the assumption that the Dinosaurs were viviparous; on the contrary,\r\nit seems more natural than that, for instance, an _Atlantosaurus_ of more\r\nthan 100 feet in length and many tons in weight, should have laid eggs.\r\n\r\nSome of the herbivorous Dinosaurs, namely, the Stegosauri and the\r\nCeratopsia, had a dermal armour of variable extent; the plates were loosely\r\nimbedded in the skin, and reached their greatest size along the middle of\r\nthe back and tail, and these crested plates were probably covered with\r\nhorny scutes, obviously weapons of defence. The Ceratopsia were armed with\r\na pair of huge pointed horns on the head, and a smaller one on the nose\r\n(see Fig. 102, p. 430). It is difficult to guess the use of the weapons of\r\nthese terrestrial monsters, unless they were employed against the equally\r\nlarge carnivorous Dinosaurs or in the combats for the possession of their\r\ncharming mates.\r\n\r\nAbout the ancestry of the Dinosaurs we know nothing except that their\r\naffinities lie with the Crocodilia; but it is impossible to derive either\r\nfrom the other. The oldest forms, in the {416}present state of our\r\nknowledge–those which have left their three-toed spoors in the Trias of\r\nConnecticut–were already much specialised by having attained to an upright\r\nbipedal gait, while the Sauropoda, which except for their gigantic size are\r\nthe most generalised, are of comparatively recent date, none of them being\r\nknown from strata older than the Upper Jurassic. Twenty years ago, until\r\nthe discoveries of numerous kinds in the United States, our knowledge of\r\nthe whole group was very limited. There is a widely spread notion that the\r\nbirds have sprung from some Dinosaurian stock. Huxley was the first to show\r\nclearly that birds were an offshoot of the reptiles, and he said of the\r\nDinosaurs, especially his Ornithoscelida (_Iguanodon_, _Scelidosaurus_,\r\n_Megalosaurus_, _Compsognathus_, and others), that they \"present a large\r\nseries of modifications intermediate in structure between existing reptiles\r\nand Aves.\" Baur proved to his own satisfaction that we have to look for the\r\nancestors of the Ratitae among the herbivorous Dinosaurs, especially the\r\nOrnithopodous forms, whilst the Carinatae are descendants of the Ratitae.\r\nHowever, even he had to give up this absolutely unwarrantable view.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to select a considerable number of characters amongst the\r\nvarious Dinosaurs which also occur in birds, and some of these have until a\r\nrecent date been considered as peculiar to birds. For instance, the double,\r\nbifurcated pubic bones of the Orthopoda; the increased number of vertebrae\r\nto which the horizontally elongated ilia are attached, especially in the\r\nforms with an upright gait, and the bipedal feature itself; the possession\r\nof an ascending process of the astragalus and its fusion with the tibia in\r\n_Compsognathus_ and _Ceratosaurus_ among the Theropoda, and in\r\n_Ornithomimus_; the attachment of the distal tarsalia to the metatarsalia,\r\n_e.g._ in _Compsognathus_,–in fact, the formation of an intertarsal joint,\r\na feature otherwise characteristic of, and peculiar to, birds; the frequent\r\nreduction of the fifth metatarsal bone; the backward position of the hallux\r\nand the proximal reduction of its metatarsal in _Compsognathus_; the\r\nelongation and partial fusion of the functional metatarsals in the latter\r\ngenus and in _Ceratosaurus_; the regular increase of the phalangeal numbers\r\nof the first four toes from two to five in many of the Ornithopoda;–in\r\nshort, the great resemblance between the feet of some of the Dinosaurs and\r\nthose of the birds. However striking these arguments are, they are\r\ninstances of {417}convergent analogies. The upright walk, which has been\r\nassumed and improved upon independently by members of both Theropoda and\r\nOrthopoda, has produced the same, or nearly the same modifications in them\r\nas in the birds.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to show that these features are mere coincidences. The oldest\r\nbird known is _Archaeopteryx_ from the Upper Oolite of Bavaria.\r\nConsequently all those Dinosaurs, which are of the same and of later date,\r\nhave to be excluded from the supposed ancestry, and they happen to be those\r\nin which (as in _Ceratosaurus_, _Compsognathus_, _Ornithomimus_,\r\n_Iguanodon_) the resemblances are greatest. There remains only\r\n_Anchisaurus_ of the Upper Trias, more or less contemporary with the\r\n_Brontozoum_, which left its three-toed footprints (_Archaeopteryx_ has\r\nfour well-developed toes) with _Zanclodon_. Moreover, the most bird-like\r\nfoot is either that of the Theropoda, which, like _Anchisaurus_ and\r\n_Zanclodon_, differ from birds by the formation of the pelvis, or of some\r\nof the latest Ornithopoda. What, then, is the good of selecting a number of\r\nbird-like features from members of Dinosaurs which we are bound to class in\r\ndifferent groups, and which existed, some in the lower, others in the\r\nmiddle, or even in the latest Mesozoic periods?\r\n\r\nLastly, the advocates of the Dinosaurian ancestry of birds cannot have\r\nfully appreciated the enormous differences between the wing of\r\n_Archaeopteryx_ and the fore-limb of any Dinosaur with the most avian\r\nresemblances in the hind-limbs. The fore-limbs of these reptiles are\r\nmodified in a direction diametrically opposed to that from which a\r\nbird-like wing could be developed. The skull presents another\r\ndifficulty,and here again _Compsognathus_, a contemporary of\r\n_Archaeopteryx_, comes perhaps nearest to that of a generalised bird's\r\nskull. The ancestors of the birds must have combined the following\r\ncharacters:–Of not later than Mid-Oolitic age, with bifurcated pubic bones,\r\nfour functional toes, elongated metatarsals, complete clavicles,\r\npremaxillary teeth, and free, not firmly fixed quadrate bones. But such\r\ncreatures are not Dinosaurs.\r\n\r\nWe divide the enormous number of Dinosaurs according to the formation of\r\nthe pelvis, that of the hind-limbs, and the dentition, into four orders.\r\n\r\n\r\n{418}ORDER I. SAUROPODA.\r\n\r\n_Pubes simple, with symphysis. Premaxillae with teeth. Plantigrade._\r\n\r\nThe teeth are mostly spatulate, laterally compressed, with sharp edges, but\r\nwithout serrations. Skull with a pair of large pre-orbital fossae. The\r\ncentra of the vertebrae of the trunk have large lateral cavities. The fore-\r\nand hind-limbs are pentadactyle, plantigrade, and hoofed, of the typical\r\nwalking type; the bones of the limbs are stout and solid; the femur is\r\ndevoid of an inner distal or fourth trochanter. The carpal and tarsal bones\r\nare free. Herbivorous. The Sauropoda comprise some of the most gigantic\r\nterrestrial creatures which have ever existed, compared with some of which\r\nthe bulk of an elephant appears almost insignificant. Their range in time\r\nextends from the Lower Oolite into the Cretaceous, with a perhaps\r\nworld-wide distribution, namely, Western Europe, North America, Patagonia,\r\nMadagascar, and India. Although they are, except for their size, the least\r\nspecialised of all Dinosaurs, none of the Sauropoda hitherto discovered are\r\nold enough to claim to be the ancestors of the other Dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.–Skeleton of _Brontosaurus excelsus_. × 1/180.\r\n(After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\n_Brontosaurus excelsus_ of the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming was a giant at\r\nleast 60 feet long and about 10 feet high. The head is extremely small in\r\nproportion, not so broad as the fourth of the thirteen vertebrae of the\r\nlong and flexible neck. The trunk is comparatively short, the tail longer\r\nthan the neck, and provided with numerous chevron-bones. Most of the\r\nvertebrae are hollow, especially the five co-ossified sacrals. The spinal\r\ncanal of the sacral region is very wide, indicating a strong sacral\r\nswelling in conformity with the huge posterior limbs. The pubic bones are\r\nstronger than the ischia. The long axis of the {419}former stands almost\r\nvertically like that of elephants, and the knee is scarcely bent in the\r\nerect position. The shoulder-girdle consists of long scapulae, broad at the\r\nbase and small, almost square and perforated coracoids, which latter fit\r\ninto a pair of partly ossified plates representing the sternum.\r\n\r\n_Atlantosaurus immanis_ of the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming and Colorado, is\r\nsupposed to have been 115 feet long, perhaps the biggest and bulkiest of\r\nall animals, the femur measuring more than 6 feet in length and 2 in width\r\nat the upper end.\r\n\r\n_Morosaurus grandis_, of the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming, with allied forms\r\nin the Purbeck and Wealden of England, reached a length of 30 feet; in\r\ngeneral appearance resembling _Brontosaurus_, but the sacrum consists of\r\nfour vertebrae only, and the ischia are bent backwards in their distal\r\nhalves, so that their symphysis is formed by the shafts instead of by their\r\nends.\r\n\r\n_Ornithopsis_ and _Cetiosaurus_, likewise huge creatures, from the English\r\nWealden and from the Great Oolite respectively, are rather imperfectly\r\nknown, although several species of each, under many generic synonyms, have\r\nbeen described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.–Front view of the pelvis of _Morosaurus grandis_. ×\r\n1/30. (After Marsh.) _a_, First sacral vertebra; _b_, \"transverse process\"\r\n(rib) of first sacral; _il_, ilium; _is_, ischium; _nc_, neural canal;\r\n_pb_, pubis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.–Skull of _Diplodocus longus_. × 1/12 (After\r\nMarsh.)]\r\n\r\n_Diplodocus longus_, of the Upper Jurassic of Colorado and Wyoming, is\r\nalmost completely known. More than 40 feet long, it had a head in its\r\ngeneral outlines not unlike that of a horse, the skull being about two feet\r\nlong. The outer nasal openings are confluent, elongated, and lie far back\r\non the top of the skull. There is a pair of large antorbital, and a pair of\r\nsmaller lacrymal fossae. The teeth, long and slender, are restricted to the\r\nanterior portion of the mouth, with many successors, which, decreasing in\r\nsize, lie on the inner or lingual side of the functional tooth, like the\r\ncartridges in a repeating rifle. The {420}functional teeth themselves are\r\nimplanted in sockets. The generic name refers to the peculiar\r\nchevron-bones, each half of which diverges into an anterior and a posterior\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how these huge, long-necked Sauropoda lived\r\nand moved about. The long neck suggests at first sight predacious habits,\r\nbut the teeth, rather feeble in _Diplodocus_, and distinctly of the\r\nplant-cutting type in other genera, put this out of the question. The high\r\nposition of the unpaired nasal opening, and the shortened nasal bones of\r\n_Diplodocus_, are features indicative of aquatic habits, but the\r\nshort-toed, plantigrade limbs are absolutely adapted to terrestrial life,\r\nand we cannot well assume that such enormous brutes as _Atlantosaurus_\r\ncould possibly have ventured into swampy ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. THEROPODA.\r\n\r\n_Pubes simple, with symphysis. Premaxillae with teeth. Digitigrade.\r\nCarnivorous._\r\n\r\nThe teeth are pointed, recurved, laterally compressed and serrated. The\r\nnasal openings are large, lateral, and nearly terminal. The vertebrae and\r\nthe large bones of the limbs are hollow. The fore-limbs are considerably\r\nshorter than the hind-limbs, which are distinctly digitigrade, many of the\r\nspecies having a pronouncedly upright gait. The proximal tarsalia show a\r\ntendency to fuse with the tibia, and the astragalus has sometimes an\r\nascending process, by which the fusion with the tibia is strengthened. The\r\nfirst and fifth metatarsals are often reduced, while the three middle bones\r\nare elongated and sometimes even fused with each other, so that the whole\r\nfoot assumes a striking resemblance to that of birds. The terminal\r\nphalanges are protected by curved claws. Owing to the shortness of the\r\nfore-limbs, and the often considerable length of the hind-limbs, which are\r\nstrongly bent at the knee and the ankle-joint, these animals must have\r\nprogressed somewhat like clumsy kangaroos.\r\n\r\nThe Theropoda, of which a great number of genera are now known, from the\r\nsize of a slender cat to that of an elephant, lived from the Upper Trias to\r\nthe Upper Oolite, both in Europe and in North America.\r\n\r\n_Brontozoum giganteum_, one of the oldest forms, is known {421}from its\r\nfoot-spoors only, which, together with other three-toed spoors in the\r\nsandstone of the Connecticut valley, were originally described and figured\r\nby Hitchcock as _Ornithichnites_ (ἴχνος = track, or spoor). Some of these\r\nimprints are more than a foot in length, the right and left spoors\r\nfollowing alternately at a distance of from four to six feet. In some cases\r\nthe long trailing tail has left a furrow behind, and the large tracks are\r\naccompanied or crossed by much smaller, and even by quite tiny tracks,\r\notherwise similar, and undoubtedly made by the young.\r\n\r\n_Anchisaurus_, from the same locality, was still Sauropodous, in so far as\r\nthe metatarsals are still free, with two, three, four, and five phalanges\r\non the first four toes, but the fifth metatarsal is reduced, carrying a\r\nvestige of only one phalanx, and the proximal tarsal bones are fused with\r\nthe tibia and fibula respectively. Total length some seven feet, of which\r\nabout four belong to the tail.\r\n\r\n_Zanclodon_, from the Keuper of Würtemberg, about ten feet long, with\r\npentadactyle hands and feet. Ischia stronger than the pubic bones, which\r\nare distally much broadened. The femur is nearly three feet long, and\r\npossesses a fourth trochanter. The astragalus has an ascending process, and\r\nis fused with the tibia. The toes are short, strong, and clawed. The\r\nshoulder-girdle and fore-limb are strong, the latter well adapted to\r\ngrasping. The teeth are much compressed laterally, with sharp, finely\r\nserrated edges. Several allied genera have been described from the Upper\r\nTrias of France and England: others from corresponding strata of India and\r\nSouth Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.–Skull of _Anchisaurus coelurus_. × ¼. (After\r\nMarsh.) _a_, Nasal fossa; _b_, antorbital, _c_, infra-temporal, _d_,\r\nsupra-temporal, and _o_, orbital fossa; _q_, quadrate bone.]\r\n\r\n_Megalosaurus_, from the Trias to the Wealden in England and France, with\r\nother species in Colorado and India, reached a considerable size, larger\r\nthan that of any other Theropoda, the scapula of _M. bucklandi_ being\r\nnearly three feet long, and the femur still longer. The hind-limbs are\r\ntwice as long as the fore-limbs. The cervical vertebrae are short, the neck\r\nbeing much shorter than the tail. Hands with five fingers, feet with four\r\ntoes. Pubic bones long and slender, with a broad symphysis. With\r\nwell-developed abdominal ribs, resembling those of crocodiles.\r\n\r\n{422}_Allosaurus_, from the Upper Jurassic of North America, with only\r\nthree toes. Ischia and pubes united into one symphysis. Anterior\r\nextremities very short. Sacrum consisting of four vertebrae. Total length\r\nof some of the larger species about twenty feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.–Skeleton (× 1/40) and skull of _Ceratosaurus\r\nnasicornis_. (After Marsh.) _a_, Nasal cavity; _b_, bony horn-supporting\r\nexcrescence; _c_, pre-orbital fossa; _d_, orbital fossa.]\r\n\r\n_Ceratosaurus nasicornis_, from the Upper Jurassic of Colorado, is about\r\nseventeen feet long. The generic and specific names refer to the nasal\r\nbones, which are raised into an unpaired longitudinal crest. This, by its\r\nrough surface, suggests that it was covered by a horny sheath, or carried a\r\nhorn. The large skull, about two feet in length, is armed with strong,\r\nslightly curved, laterally compressed, sharp teeth, unequal in size. The\r\npre-orbital foramen is large, bordered above by the prefrontals, which are\r\nraised into prominent knobs. The supratemporal foramina are extremely\r\nsmall, the lateral foramina very large. The quadrate slants backwards. The\r\nsacrum consists of five vertebrae. The caudal vertebrae carry long and\r\nslender chevron-bones. The pubes and ischia are long and slender, each\r\nforming a separate symphysis at their broadened ends. The three\r\n{423}metatarsals are elongated and fused with each other. There seems to\r\nhave been some dermal armour in the shape of osseous plates, which extended\r\nin one series from the occiput over the neck.\r\n\r\n_Coelurus gracilis_, of the Upper Jurassic of Wyoming, and closely allied\r\nforms in the Wealden of England, are remarkable for the pneumaticity of the\r\ncentra and processes of their vertebrae, the bony parts of which are\r\nrestricted to thin, hollowed-out shells, so that the whole skeleton must\r\nhave been very light. Computed length of these imperfectly preserved\r\ncreatures about five feet.\r\n\r\n_Hallopus victor_, of the Upper Jurassic of Colorado. Anterior extremities\r\nvery short, with only four fingers; posterior limbs very long and slender,\r\nespecially the tibia; the much elongated metatarsals are separate, the\r\nfirst absent, the fifth much reduced, so that the foot is tridactyle; the\r\ncalcaneum projects like a heel. The ilium is attached to two sacral\r\nvertebrae only; the pubes are slender, forming a narrow symphysis, while\r\nthat of the ischia is broad. Most of the bones of this creature, which\r\nprobably progressed by hops, are hollow. Total length about three feet, the\r\nlength of the hind-limbs being about nine inches.\r\n\r\n_Compsognathus longipes_, of the Upper Jurassic of Bavaria, is one of the\r\nsmallest of all the Dinosaurs. It is most remarkable on account of its\r\nalmost bird-like feet. The fibula is much thinner and somewhat shorter than\r\nthe tibia; the latter is closely attached to, although not fused with the\r\nproximal tarsal bones, while the distal tarsals are fused with the united\r\nand much elongated second, third, and fourth metatarsals; the fifth is\r\nreduced to a short bone near the intertarsal joint; while the first is\r\nrepresented by its distal portion only, which is stowed away on the hinder\r\naspect of the middle of the second metatarsal, and carries two phalanges.\r\nThe three middle toes consist of three, four, and four phalanges\r\nrespectively. Whilst the whole hind-limb is typically avian, the pelvis is\r\nquite different; the pubic bones are simple, slender, and directed\r\nforwards, forming a symphysis with their whole distal halves, and\r\nbroadening out distally into a horizontal process directed towards the\r\nsymphysis, which is likewise formed by the fusion of the inner surfaces of\r\nthe thin and rather flat ischia. The fore-limbs are only half the size of\r\nthe hind-limbs. The neck consists of about ten vertebrae, mostly with long\r\nand {424}pointed ribs. Tail long with well-developed chevrons. The skull is\r\nlong and pointed, composed of thin bones, which have lost most of the\r\nsutures; with large lateral, temporal, and pre-orbital, but without\r\nsupratemporal, foramina. Premaxillae, maxillae, and mandible with numerous\r\nslender and rather long, conical, alveolar teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER III. ORTHOPODA\r\n\r\n  _Each pubic bone consists of an anterior or pre-pubic and a posterior or\r\n  post-pubic branch, neither of which forms a symphysis. Premaxillae\r\n  without teeth. With a premandibular predentary piece. Herbivorous._\r\n\r\nThe so-called pre-pubis is homologous with the pubis of most recent\r\nreptiles, and with the pectineal process of birds, while the \"post-pubis\"\r\nis homologous with the processus lateralis of Chelonians and Saurians, and\r\nwith the \"pubis\" of birds. The right and left halves of the pubis remain\r\nwidely asunder ventrally. In many cases the post-pubis, always directed\r\nobliquely backwards, lies closely against the shaft of the ischium, which\r\nalways forms a distal syndesmosis, or a symphysis, with its fellow. The\r\nfore-limbs are usually very short, provided with five or four short and\r\nstrong fingers. The hind-limbs are long and strong, mostly with three,\r\nsometimes with four functional short toes, either plantigrade (STEGOSAURI)\r\nor digitigrade (ORNITHOPODA). Femur with an inner distal, or fourth,\r\ntrochanter. The dentition is of the herbivorous type, restricted to the\r\ndentaries of the mandible and to the maxillary bones, leaving the whole or\r\nthe greater part of the premaxillaries free. The additional \"predentary\"\r\npiece of the mandible is possibly a calcified, but originally horny, pad.\r\nThe teeth are greatly compressed laterally, and finely serrated, but are\r\nmuch ground down by use; several rows of successional teeth lie on the\r\ninner or lingual side. The skull is strongly built, with large anterior\r\nnasal openings; pre-orbital foramina very small or absent; orbits\r\ncompletely encircled by bones; supratemporal foramina small, lateral\r\nforamina large. Quadrate large, vertical or slanting slightly forwards. The\r\nvertebrae are solid, not hollow; sacrum consisting of four, five, or more\r\nvertebrae; ribs bifurcated, the capitula carried either by the centra, or\r\nmoved up to the diapophyses of the neural arches; chevron-bones\r\n{425}numerous, and frequently long, especially on the anterior half of the\r\nlong and heavy tail.\r\n\r\nOrthopoda occur from the Lias to the Upper Cretaceous, both in Europe and\r\nin North America. The name Orthopoda, invented by Cope in 1866, is\r\nappropriate for obvious reasons; it comprises the Stegosauri and\r\nOrnithopoda of Marsh (1881). The latter term is not very fortunately\r\nchosen, considering that the whole hind-limb of the Theropodous\r\n_Compsognathus_ is far more ornithic than that of any three-toed\r\nOrnithopoda, in which the tarsalia rarely fuse with the tibia and never\r\nwith the metatarsals. To apply the term Ornithopoda to the whole order is\r\nquite unjustifiable, unless it is meant to apply to the strikingly\r\nbird-like configuration of the pelvis.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 1. STEGOSAURI.–The fore- and hind-feet are plantigrade, or nearly\r\nso, the metapodials being but little elongated, with more than three\r\nfunctional digits. The bones of the limbs are solid. The ribs of the trunk\r\nare bifurcated, and are carried by the diapophyses of the neural arches.\r\nThe body, especially the back, is protected by dermal bony plates, which\r\nare not connected with the internal skeleton.\r\n\r\n_Scelidosaurus harrisoni._ One nearly complete skeleton, about 11 feet in\r\nlength, from the Lias of Lyme Regis. About twenty-four pre-sacral\r\nvertebrae, of which six or seven belong to the neck, four sacral and about\r\nforty caudal vertebrae. Four fingers, four toes, with 2, 3, 4, 5 phalanges,\r\nthe fifth metapodials being quite vestigial; the hallux and pollex are very\r\nshort, so that the foot at least is functionally tridactyle. The tarsal\r\nbones remain separate. The head is very small. Two rows of ridged bony\r\nplates extend from the neck over the back, and converge into one row upon\r\nthe long tail; smaller plates, arranged in many rows, seem to have\r\nprotected the sides and under parts. _Hylaeosaurus_ and _Polacanthus_ of\r\nthe English Wealden are allied forms.\r\n\r\n_Stegosaurus_, with several species from the Upper Jurassic of Colorado and\r\nWyoming, and others, e.g. _S. armatus_ (= _Omosaurus_), from the Kimmeridge\r\nClay of Wiltshire in England. The head is relatively very small, and the\r\nbrain is surpassed several times in thickness by the huge sacral swelling\r\nof the spinal cord. Teeth numerous and small. All the cervical and\r\ntrunk-vertebrae carry bifurcated ribs, those of the trunk being carried\r\nentirely by the very high neural arches. The fore-limbs are only about half\r\n{426}the length of that of the hind-limbs, so that these creatures, which\r\nwere undoubtedly quadrupedal, must have had a very peculiar gait, standing\r\nwith the head, neck, and shoulders much lower than the arched back and\r\npelvic region. The ulna has a strong olecranon; the hand has four\r\nfunctional fingers. The pre-acetabular portion of the ilium is much\r\nelongated; the pre-pubic branch stands horizontally, while the post-pubis\r\nis closely adpressed to the ischium. The astragalus is fused with the\r\ntibia, the calcaneum with the fibula. The foot has only three short toes,\r\nprotected, like the fingers, by hoofs. The dorsal dermal armature consists\r\nof very high, crest-like plates. _S. ungulatus_ of North America has a\r\ncomputed length of 28 feet, with the hind-limbs about 7 feet long. This\r\ncreature was nearly 10 feet high, when measured from the ground to the tips\r\nof the dermal crests on the middle of the back. These bony, laterally\r\ncompressed plates are themselves nearly 3 feet high, and are replaced, on\r\nthe hinder portion of the tail, by several pairs of pointed spikes about 2\r\nfeet in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.–Skeleton and dermal armour of _Stegosaurus\r\nungulatus_. × 1/60. (After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 2. ORNITHOPODA.–The hind-limbs are distinctly digitigrade,\r\nusually with only three functional toes, protected by claws. The long bones\r\nare hollow. Femur with a long fourth trochanter. Without dermal\r\narmour-plates.\r\n\r\n_Camptosaurus._–Several species, up to 10 feet in length, from {427}the\r\nUpper Jurassic and the Wealden of North America and England. Five fingers,\r\nwith 2, 3, 3, 3, 2 phalanges and four toes, with 2, 3, 4, 5 phalanges, but\r\nthe hallux is much shortened and does not touch the hard ground; astragalus\r\nand calcaneum separate.\r\n\r\n_Laosaurus_ of Colorado is a smaller form, intermediate in structure\r\nbetween the former genus and _Hypsilophodon foxi_ from the Wealden of the\r\nIsle of Wight. A small creature, less than 5 feet in length. Four fingers,\r\nwith 2, 3, 4, 2 phalanges; fifth metacarpal vestigial. Four toes with 2, 3,\r\n4, 5 phalanges and long claws. Astragalus and calcaneum separate.\r\nPost-pubis very slender. Each premaxillary with five pointed alveolar\r\nteeth, leaving a wide median diastema; maxillaries with eleven, dentaries\r\nwith ten laterally compressed blade-like teeth.\r\n\r\n_Iguanodon_ from the Wealden of England, Belgium, and Germany. Apparently\r\ntwo species, _I. mantelli_, about 16 feet, _I. bernissartensis_ nearly 30\r\nfeet long. The premaxilla is quite toothless; the teeth of the maxillae and\r\nmandibles stand in close series, implanted in alveolae; they are spatulate,\r\nlaterally compressed, with finely serrated edges, and slightly curved, the\r\nlower outwards, the upper inwards, and bear a general resemblance to those\r\nof _Iguana_, hence the generic name. There is only one functional set of\r\nteeth, and these are much worn down by use, but in such a way that, owing\r\nto the different curvature of the opposed teeth, the worn-down crowns form\r\ncutting, and at the same time crushing, almost triturating surfaces,\r\nindicating that these animals lived upon herbs. The gait of these creatures\r\nwas upright, as shown by their spoors; the long almost vertical ischia,\r\nwhich form a padded symphysis, only slightly raised above the ground,\r\nsuggest that this symphysis was used as a true sitting support, the animal\r\nresting upon it, the hind-limbs and the long tail. The latter, to judge\r\nfrom the long chevrons and the high neural spinous processes, must have\r\nbeen furnished with strong muscles. The whole tail was undoubtedly used as\r\na balance during the upright position. Many of the tendons of the dorsal\r\nspinal muscles on the back and upper half of the tail are ossified. The\r\npost-pubic branches are very slender, distally much reduced, and, except at\r\nthe obturator-foramen, separated from the ischia; the pre-pubes are very\r\nstrong and broad. The femur has a fourth trochanter, a feature which\r\n{428}induced the unfortunate late Paul Albrecht to declare that _Iguanodon_\r\nwas a reptilian Duck! The tarsal bones are separate. The metatarsals and\r\ntoes are reduced to three, with 3, 4, 5 phalanges respectively, the first\r\nbeing a mere styliform vestige. The anterior limbs are likewise very\r\npowerful, but are much shorter; the hands are adapted for grasping,\r\npossibly for defence and offence, as indicated by the pollex, which,\r\nalthough short, is transformed into a formidable spur-like weapon, firmly\r\nfixed at a right angle to the other four fingers, the phalanges of which\r\nnumber 3, 3, 3, 4; the second and third fingers were protected by hoof-like\r\nnails, the fifth finger is feeble, and stands somewhat apart. The whole\r\nvertebral column consists of more than eighty vertebrae, of which ten are\r\ncervical, eighteen thoracic and lumbar, while five or six are fused into\r\nthe sacrum. The cervical vertebrae are opisthocoelous, and carry short\r\nribs, except the atlas, which possesses two separate supra-dorsal pieces,\r\nwhich fill the gap between it and the occiput.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.–Skeleton of _Iguanodon bernissartensis_. × 1/80.\r\n(After Marsh.)]\r\n\r\nMany specimens of _I. bernissartensis_, which is now completely known,\r\nincluding even the hyoid bones, were discovered in 1878, in the Belgian\r\ncolliery of Bernissart, between Mons and Tournai, close to the French\r\nfrontier. The bones were in a fault or crack, filled with clay of Wealden\r\nage, about one thousand feet below the present sea-level, and there about\r\nthirty Iguanodons, all {429}apparently adult, had become embedded. Five of\r\nthem are now mounted in one of the public galleries of the Brussels Museum,\r\nof which these perfect monsters form one of the chief attractions. Having\r\nproved to be such a valuable find, they were claimed by the Government, on\r\nthe ground that Iguanodons were not included in the license of the Coal\r\nMining Company. The fact that not only _I. bernissartensis_, but also a few\r\nspecimens of _I. mantelli_, already known from England, where the large\r\nform likewise occurs, were found in the same place, makes the specific\r\ndifferences somewhat doubtful; they are perhaps sexual.\r\n\r\n_Claosaurus_ of the uppermost Cretaceous strata of Wyoming, is one of the\r\nlatest of Dinosaurs. It is nearly allied to _Iguanodon_, but has only three\r\nfunctional fingers, the fifth being absent, whilst the pollex is very\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n_Hadrosaurus_ s. _Diclonius_ of the same level as the preceding genus in\r\nNorth America, apparently also in the Middle and Upper Chalk of England and\r\nBelgium, has a most peculiar spoon-shaped bill, the premaxilla and the\r\npredental bone being spatulate and quite toothless. The teeth in the upper\r\nand lower jaws are numerous and small, and whilst one set of teeth is being\r\nground down, the several successional series are already functional. _H.\r\nmirabilis_ has in all about 2000 teeth; the total length of the skeleton is\r\n38 feet, of which nearly 4 feet are taken up by the skull; in other\r\nrespects this genus is allied to _Iguanodon_.\r\n\r\n_Ornithomimus_, of the Upper Cretaceous of Colorado, is known only from its\r\nfore- and hind-limbs. The fore-limbs are short, with three fingers. The\r\nhind-limbs are very long and strikingly bird-like. The metatarsals, of\r\nwhich only the second, third, and fourth are developed, are much elongated;\r\nthe proximal half of the third is pushed back between the second and\r\nfourth, and imperfectly fused with them, exactly as in young birds. The\r\nastragalus has a long ascending process, and is fused with the tibia. The\r\nfibula is very slender, distally much reduced; the calcaneum is represented\r\nby a tiny nodule; the terminal phalanges end in pointed claws. _O. grandis_\r\nmust have reached a considerable size, to judge from its middle metatarsal,\r\nwhich is 60 cm. or 2 feet long. Until more is known of these extraordinary\r\ncreatures, nothing definite can be said about their affinities. They may\r\nperhaps belong to the Theropoda.\r\n\r\n\r\n{430}ORDER IV. CERATOPSIA.\r\n\r\n  _Pubic bones simple, forming a symphysis, post-pubic branches being\r\n  absent. The mandible carries a toothless \"pre-dental,\" and the fused\r\n  premaxillaries carry a similar, toothless, \"rostral\" bone._\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the upper and lower jaws are alveolar, and have two roots. The\r\nfore-limbs are little shorter than the hind-limbs; pentadactyle and\r\nplantigrade, with broad hoofs. Femur without a fourth trochanter.\r\nLimb-bones solid. The skull is large, and remarkable for a pair of long\r\nfrontal bony cores, which probably carried large, pointed horns; the\r\nparietal bones form a huge, horizontally broadened out crest, which extends\r\nbackwards over the neck. Upon this cranial neck-shield follow small dermal\r\nbony plates. These miraculous creatures flourished during the Cretaceous\r\nepoch in Europe and in North America. Some, for instance, the American\r\n_Triceratops flabellatus_, reached a huge size, its skull alone measuring\r\nmore than 5 feet in length, while that of _T. prorsus_ is, including the\r\nneck-shield, about 7 feet long. The total length of this monster, the back\r\nof which stands about 8 feet high, is more than 20 feet. Other genera seem\r\nto have a well-developed dermal armour, _e.g._ _Nodosaurus_ of the Middle\r\nCretaceous period of Wyoming.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.–Skeleton of _Triceratops prorsus_. × 1/70. (After\r\nMarsh.)]\r\n\r\nThe Ceratopsia combine characters of the Sauropoda and of the Stegosaurian\r\nOrthopoda; in their pelvis they agree with the former, in the development\r\nof dermal armour and a predental bone they agree with the latter, while\r\nthey differ from either by the possession of a rostral element.\r\n\r\n\r\n{431}_SUB-CLASS VI.–CROCODILIA._\r\n\r\nIf we had to deal only with the recent Crocodilia the following would be an\r\nall sufficient diagnosis:–_Four footed, long-tailed reptiles, with fixed\r\nquadrate bones, with teeth separately implanted in alveolae and restricted\r\nto the upper and lower jaws._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.–1, Atlas and axis of _Crocodilus_. 2, Atlas and\r\naxis of _Metriorhynchus_, a Jurassic Crocodile, see p. 439. 3, Analysis of\r\nthe first two cervical vertebrae of a Crocodile. 4, Diagram of the\r\nfundamental composition of a Reptilian or other Amniotic, typically\r\ngastrocentrous vertebra. _Az_, Anterior zygapophysis; _B.D_, basidorsal;\r\n_B.V_, basiventral; _C_{1}_, _C_{2}_, first and second centra, formed by\r\nthe interventralia; _Cp^1_, _Cp^2_, articular facets of the capitular\r\nportions of the first and second ribs; _I.V_, interventral; _N_{1}_,\r\n_N_{2}_, first and second neural arch, formed by the basidorsalia (_B.D_ in\r\n4); _Od_, odontoid process = first centrum; _Pz_, posterior zygapophysis;\r\n_R_{1}_, _R_{2}_, ribs; _Sp_, detached spinous process of the first neural\r\narch; _t_{1}_, _t_{2}_, facets of the tubercular portions of the first and\r\nsecond ribs; 1, 2, intercentra = basiventralia; ^2 (in 3), second\r\nbasiventral \"complex or intercentrum,\" continued upwards as a meniscus or\r\nintervertebral pad; _I_, _II_, _III_, position of the exit of the first,\r\nsecond, and third spinal nerves.]\r\n\r\nTo define Crocodilia in general and to distinguish them from various\r\nextinct groups we have to resort to additional characters. The vertebrae\r\nare solid; the ribs of the neck and thorax possess a distinct capitulum and\r\ntuberculum; there is a series of loose, compound abdominal ribs; the\r\nhumerus is devoid of an entepicondylar foramen; the iliac bones are\r\nbroadened out and attached to two sacral vertebrae; the pubic bones are\r\nsimple, not bifurcated, and neither they nor the ischia are ventrally\r\nunited. The skull always has a strong, bony, quadrato-jugal arch. The\r\npossession of a longitudinal cloacal opening and of {432}an anterior or\r\nventral single copulatory organ can of course be asserted of recent forms\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these many characters common to all Crocodilia, it is very\r\ndifficult to separate the latter from the Dinosauria, the only absolute\r\ndifference lying in the ventral pelvic bones. It is therefore most\r\nsuggestive that the fore-limbs of the Mesozoic Crocodilia are so much\r\nshorter and weaker than their hind-limbs, a discrepancy which is not\r\nlessened before the Tertiary epoch. The Mesozoic Crocodilia were almost\r\nentirely marine; the strongly-developed ankle-joint (indicated already by\r\nsuch early forms as _Aetosaurus_ and _Mystriosaurus_) must have been\r\ninherited from some terrestrial group with digitigrade tendencies and\r\nshortened hind-limbs. All this points to some Theropodous Dinosaurian stock\r\nof which the Crocodilia may well form an aquatic, further-developed branch.\r\nLoss of the pubic and ischiadic ventral symphysis is not a serious\r\nmodification. So far as modern reptiles are concerned only the Chelonia and\r\n_Sphenodon_ are related to the Crocodilia, whilst Monitors and other\r\nlizards resemble them only superficially. We divide them into three Orders.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. PSEUDOSUCHIA.\r\n\r\nThe few members of this peculiar group of reptiles are all restricted to\r\nthe Keuper or variegated marls, although they seem to have had a wide\r\ndistribution, some having been found in Germany, others in New Mexico. They\r\nperhaps form an early side-branch of the generalised Crocodilian stock,\r\nwhich died out with the Jurassic age.\r\n\r\nThe skull is distinctly short and pointed. The premaxillaries are very\r\nsmall and are dorsally separated from each other by the large nasals, which\r\nalso keep the maxillae widely asunder. The nostrils are latero-terminal,\r\nbordered chiefly by the nasals, below by the premaxillae and part of the\r\nmaxillae. The orbit is bordered below by the strong jugals, in front by the\r\nprefrontal, above by a supra-orbital and a small postfrontal, behind by a\r\npostorbital, which, firmly connected with the jugal and squamosal, shuts\r\noff a supratemporal foramen. There is also a lateral temporal fossa, and a\r\nlarge hole enclosed by the lacrymal and the maxillary bones. The teeth are\r\nrestricted to the anterior {433}half of the jaws. The neck, back, and tail\r\nare covered by two rows of large and broad, closely-jointed bony plates;\r\nsmaller plates protect the sides and the ventral surface. The vertebrae are\r\nstill unknown.\r\n\r\n_Aëtosaurus ferratus_ of the Upper Keuper near Stuttgart is the best known.\r\nOne of the greatest treasures of the Stuttgart Museum is a slab of\r\nsandstone, about 2 square yards in size, upon which lie huddled together\r\ntwenty-four individuals of various sizes, the largest measuring 86 cm. or 2\r\nfeet 10 inches. They are in a beautiful state of preservation, and many of\r\nthem are in the most life-like attitudes, just as if a mass of sand had\r\nfallen upon them and crushed them down, and as if they were struggling to\r\nget out.\r\n\r\n_Erpetosuchus_ and _Ornithosuchus_ of the Elgin sandstone seem to be allied\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. PARASUCHIA.\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, a collateral branch of the true Crocodilia. They are,\r\nlike the Pseudosuchia, restricted to the Keuper formation. The vertebrae\r\nare mostly biconcave, sometimes with nearly plain, scarcely concave,\r\ncentral joints. The premaxillae are very long and powerful. The nostrils\r\nlie far back, rather near the orbits, on the top of the snout, within the\r\nanterior half of each nasal and almost above the choanae. The latter are\r\nsituated in front of the palatine bones and are divided by a backwardly\r\ndirected process of the vomer, which is plainly visible on the roof of the\r\nmouth. The palatines and pterygoids leave a wide median space between them.\r\nThe pterygoids are narrow and have three processes, the antero-lateral of\r\nwhich joins the palatines and the maxillary bones (there being no separate\r\nectopterygoid), the inner joins the basi-occipital, and the postero-lateral\r\nthe quadrate.\r\n\r\nThe orbit is surrounded by the frontal, prefrontal, lacrymal, postorbital\r\nand postfrontal, while the strong jugal is excluded. The temporal region\r\nshows a lateral and a dorsal foramen; the latter opens backwards and above\r\nthe occiput, being bordered in front by the parietal, laterally by the\r\nsquamoso-occipital bridge.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are amphicoelous.  The first and second {434}vertebrae are\r\ndevoid of ribs; the cervicals and first thoracics carry separate capitular\r\nand tubercular processes for the attachment of the ribs, while the ribs of\r\nthe rest of the trunk are carried entirely by the long diapophyses, as in\r\nthe modern Crocodiles. The dermal armour consists of two rows of broad,\r\ndorsal, and several rows of smaller, lateral, bony plates.\r\n\r\n_Belodon_ is by far the best-known genus, with several species in South\r\nGermany and North America, some of which reached a length of 10 feet,\r\nwithout ventral armour. The closely allied _Stagonolepis_ of the Elgin\r\nsandstone in Scotland had dorsal and ventral armour. Other genera in the\r\nTriassic formations of India and North America.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER III. EUSUCHIA.\r\n\r\nCrocodilia in the stricter sense. The premaxillae are short and always\r\nenclose the nostrils. The choanae lie behind the palatines, in recent forms\r\neven within the pterygoids. They occur from the Liassic or Lower Jurassic\r\nperiod to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe direct ancestors of the Eusuchia are still unknown. They cannot have\r\nbeen developed from the Pseudosuchia, nor do we know intermediate stages\r\nwhich connect them with the Parasuchia. The nostrils, situated within the\r\npremaxillaries, always lie in front of the nasals, although these sometimes\r\nextend forwards and form a bony internasal septum fusing with the usual\r\ncartilaginous septum. The choanae, instead of opening immediately behind\r\nthe vomer, are carried far back, owing to the formation of a secondary bony\r\npalate. In the Jurassic Crocodiles this roof is formed by the meeting of\r\nthe palatine bones in the medio-ventral line, and the choanae open\r\nimmediately behind. From Cretaceous times onwards this roofing is continued\r\nby the pterygoids, which likewise form a median suture; and the united\r\nchoanae (which may, or may not, be divided by a thin bony septum) are\r\npushed towards the posterior end of the pterygoids. Since the Jurassic\r\ntimes there exists also a tendency to enclose the Eustachian passages (the\r\nremnants of the first gill-clefts) by bone. In the earlier members they\r\nwere still wide slits or open grooves on the ventral side of the\r\nbasi-occipital bone. Since the Cretaceous epoch they have been transformed\r\ninto bony canals and open through one median hole, situated between the\r\nbasi-occipital and the {435}basisphenoid, immediately behind the posterior\r\nsymphysis of the dorsal portion of the pterygoids, which latter almost\r\ncompletely cover the basisphenoid. The vomer is not visible (except in\r\n_Caiman niger_), being covered by the ventral junction of the palatines and\r\nmaxillaries. The broad, lateral wings of the pterygoids are connected by\r\nseparate bones, the ectopterygoids = transpalatines = transverse bones,\r\nwith the maxillaries, and in recent forms also with the jugals. Thus an\r\nextensive, very firm bony palate is produced; and the large palatal\r\nforamina, between the palatines, maxillaries, ectopterygoids and\r\npterygoids, are closed by the same dense mucous membrane which cover the\r\nwhole roof of the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe opisthotic and epi-otic bones fuse early with the lateral and with the\r\nsupra-occipital bones; only the pro-otic remains longer as a separate\r\nelement, perforated anteriorly by a large hole for the exit of the third\r\nbranch of the trigeminal nerve. The basisphenoid is scarcely visible, being\r\ncovered by the pterygoids. The presphenoid is large, continued forwards and\r\nupwards into the usually cartilaginous interorbital septum. Near the\r\nanterior and upper margin of the presphenoid is a large notch on either\r\nside for the passage of the optic nerve, the three eye-muscle nerves and\r\nthe first branch of the trigeminal nerve. There are no separate\r\norbito-sphenoids, their place being taken by membrane or cartilage in\r\ncontinuation with the interorbital septum, but the alisphenoids are large,\r\nabutting upwards against the frontals. Each prefrontal sends down a\r\nvertical process which joins the palatine of its side.\r\n\r\nThe configuration of the snout varies much. There are two parallel lines of\r\ndevelopment since the Jurassic epoch, namely, long-snouted creatures, of\r\nwhich two still survive as _Gavialis_ and _Tomistoma_, and more broad and\r\nshort-snouted members like the rest of the Crocodiles and Alligators. In\r\nopposition to the Parasuchia the elongation of the snout is effected by the\r\nmaxillaries. The length of the nasals varies much, mostly in conformity\r\nwith that of the maxillaries. As a rule they reach the premaxillaries but\r\nnot always the nasal groove. In _Gavialis_ they are short, far separated\r\nfrom the premaxillaries by the maxillaries, which meet in the dorso-median\r\nline. The orbit is bordered by the frontals, which at an early age fuse\r\ninto an unpaired piece, and by the prefrontal, lacrymal, jugal, and\r\npostfrontal. {436}At a deeper level the orbit is partly divided from the\r\nlateral temporal fossa by a strong column which is formed by the meeting of\r\na downward process of the postfrontal with an inner process of the jugal,\r\nand an ascending process of the ectopterygoid (cf. Fig. 108, p. 458). This\r\narrangement adds considerably to the strength of the skull. The lateral\r\ntemporal fossa is bordered in front by the column just described; below by\r\nthe jugal and the quadrato-jugal, which is firmly wedged in between the\r\njugal and quadrate; behind by the quadrate; above by the postfrontal, which\r\nforms a strong superficial bridge with the squamosal. This rests upon and\r\noften fuses with the quadrate and an intervening transverse wing-like\r\nextension of the lateral occipital bone. By this squamoso-postfrontal\r\nbridge part of the original temporal fossa is divided into the lateral one\r\njust described, and a dorsal fossa. The latter is bordered by the\r\npostfrontal, squamosal, and united parietals. This dorsal temporal fossa is\r\nconsequently not homologous with that of the Parasuchia, a vestige of which\r\nis however present in many, especially in young skulls of Crocodiles, in\r\nthe shape of a narrow passage which extends backwards from the dorsal\r\nfossa, bridged over by the junction of the parietal with the squamosal, and\r\nbordered below by the occipitals.\r\n\r\nThe size of the upper temporal fossae stands in an inverse ratio to that of\r\nthe lateral fossae. In the older Eusuchia the upper were the larger of the\r\ntwo. The temporo-mandibular muscle which lifts or shuts the lower jaw\r\narises from the walls of the upper fossa, passes beneath the jugal arch,\r\nand is inserted into the supra-angular portion of the lower jaw. In the\r\nmore recent Crocodiles this muscle is more and more superseded by the\r\npterygo-mandibular muscle, which, arising chiefly from the dorsal surface\r\nof the much broadened-out pterygoid bone, fills the widened space between\r\nthe latter and the quadrate, and is inserted into the outer surface of the\r\nos angulare of the lower jaw. This muscle, owing to its general\r\ndisposition, is capable of much more powerful development and leverage than\r\nthe temporo-maxillary muscle, which latter, being more reduced, allows the\r\ndorsal fossae to be more and more closed up by the surrounding bones.\r\n\r\nThe fossae are still comparatively large in the long-snouted genera\r\n_Gavialis_ and _Tomistoma_, which live entirely upon fish and scarcely chew\r\ntheir food, whilst these holes almost completely {437}disappear in some of\r\nthe Alligators, namely in the broad- and short-snouted members, which,\r\nhaving a varied diet, taken from every available group of the animal\r\nkingdom, chew their prey.\r\n\r\nThe quadrate extends obliquely backwards, and is immovably wedged in and\r\npartly fused with the quadrato-jugal, the squamosal, and the lateral\r\noccipital wings. Between the latter and the quadrate remains a slit-like\r\ncanal, well visible from behind, through which passes the continuation into\r\nthe mandible of the columellar or ossicular chain of the auditory\r\napparatus. Intricate passages, used as additional enlargements of the space\r\nof the middle ear, pervade the proximal portions of the quadrate and the\r\nroof of the cranium beneath the parietal bridges mentioned above, the two\r\nsides communicating with each other. The supra-occipital bone is visible\r\nfrom behind; its top is covered and partly fused with a continuation of the\r\nparietals, which are, like the frontals, fused into an unpaired mass. The\r\noccipital condyle is formed entirely by the basi-occipital bone, so far as\r\nthe articulating facet is concerned, but it is supported on either side by\r\na lamella from the lateral occipitals.\r\n\r\nThe two halves of the lower jaw form a symphysis of very variable length.\r\nEach half is composed of six bones. (1) The articulare, perforated in its\r\nupper, posterior, inner corner by a canal for the reception of the\r\nsiphonium, a narrow tube of connective tissue, which connects the cavities\r\nof the middle ear with the large empty space enclosed within the lower jaw;\r\n(2) the angulare; (3) the dentary, which alone carries the teeth; (4) the\r\nsplenial, a long splint-like bone on the surface of the inner or median\r\nside of the jaw, of variable length; (5) the operculare, the counterpart of\r\nthe splenial on the outer side; (6) the supra-angulare, which forms the\r\ndorsal border of the lower jaw between the dentary and the angulare.\r\n\r\nThe teeth, which are more or less conical or compressed laterally, are\r\ndeeply implanted in separate sockets. They are often shed throughout life,\r\nthe successors lying on the median side, and with their caps partly fitting\r\ninto the wide, open roots of the teeth to be expelled. The number of teeth\r\nin the premaxilla is universally five on either side in recent forms, but\r\nin a few species, e.g. _Crocodilus niloticus_ and _C. porosus_, the second\r\npair is lost with maturity and is not replaced. In the broad-snouted\r\n{438}kinds, especially in the Alligators, most of the upper teeth overlap\r\nlaterally those of the lower jaw. In most species of _Crocodilus_ the\r\noverlapping is less marked and the teeth partly interlock, but the fourth\r\nmandibular tooth, generally the strongest and longest, is received into a\r\nlateral notch at the junction of the premaxillary and maxillary. Frequently\r\nthose of the longer lower teeth which fit into pits of the upper jaw,\r\ngradually transform the pits into holes by continued pressure upon the\r\nbone, and in old specimens the tip of the lower tooth may even perforate\r\nand stand out above the skin of the snout.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are solid, but remnants of the notochord persist for a long\r\ntime in the middle of the centra. These are still amphicoelous in the\r\nJurassic Eusuchia, and there were probably considerable intervertebral\r\nportions of the notochord. From the Lower Chalk onwards the vertebrae are\r\nprocoelous, with the exception of the first caudal vertebra, which has a\r\nknob at either end, so that naturally the posterior of the two sacral\r\nvertebrae is opisthocoelous. This peculiar formation of the first caudal is\r\nprobably correlated with the flexibility of the tail.\r\n\r\nCartilaginous intercentral rings, pads or menisci, occur regularly\r\nthroughout the vertebral column, unless they are abolished by fusion of\r\nadjoining vertebrae. It is most instructive to follow the attachment of the\r\nribs in one and the same individual. The position of the capitulum,\r\nvertically below the tuberculum in the neck, changes in the thorax into one\r\nin which the capitulum lies anterior to the tuberculum and in the same\r\nhorizontal plane with it. Moreover, whilst on the cervical vertebrae the\r\ncapitulum is carried by the centrum (enclosing with the tuberculum a\r\ntypical transverse canal for the vertebral artery, etc.), further back it\r\nmoves its point of attachment upwards, lying right upon the neuro-central\r\nsuture on the tenth and eleventh vertebrae. From the twelfth vertebra\r\nbackwards both capitulum and tuberculum are carried by the transverse\r\nprocess or diapophysis of the neural arch. The ribs of the five or six\r\nlumbar vertebrae are merely vestigial or absent. The ribs of the two sacral\r\nvertebrae are very stout, fusing in the adult with both centrum and neural\r\narch. Some of the anterior caudal vertebrae also carry ribs, attached\r\nacross the neuro-central suture; long before maturity they fuse with their\r\nvertebrae, and then look like transverse processes. Most of the caudal\r\nvertebrae carry also a {439}pair of chevron-bones, and these are continuous\r\nwith the intercentral rings of cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe atlas and the epistropheus or axis are of supreme interest. Crocodiles\r\nare, in fact, the only animals in which these two vertebrae retain all\r\ntheir constituent hard parts in an almost undisturbed primitive condition\r\n(Fig. 103, 1-4). The basal piece of the atlas-ring, the first basiventral\r\nor intercentrum, carries a pair of long ribs attached by their capitular\r\nportions. A small knob near the dorsal edge of the rib occurs in many\r\nspecimens, and is the last remnant of the tubercular portion. The latter\r\nwas still complete in Jurassic Crocodiles, for instance in _Metriorhynchus_\r\n(Fig. 103, 2, _t_{1}_). The first centrum joins that of the second vertebra\r\nas its so-called odontoid process, not directly, however, but by the\r\nintercalation of the complete second basiventral, represented by a\r\ncartilaginous disc, and by a large unpaired pyramidal piece (Fig. 103, 3,\r\n^2). This, serially homologous with the ventral half of the atlas-ring, is\r\nthe second basiventral intercentrum, wedged in from below between the\r\nodontoid process and the second centrum, with which it soon fuses.\r\nMoreover, it carries the capitulum of the second rib (2, _Cp^2_), the\r\ntuberculum of which is articulated with a facet of the second neural arch\r\nin Jurassic Eusuchia (_t_{2}_). In recent Crocodiles this tubercular\r\nportion is much reduced, and, curiously enough, is attached to a knob which\r\nbelongs to the odontoid piece or first centrum. This shifting explains the\r\napparently anomalous condition that \"the atlas of the Crocodiles carries\r\ntwo pairs of ribs, the second vertebra none.\" To complete the account of\r\nthe atlas we have to mention the separate unpaired piece which lies upon\r\nthe two neural arches. It is the detached neural spine, and not the remnant\r\nof a \"pro-atlas.\"\r\n\r\nThe first and second ribs (_R_{1}_ and _R_{2}_), at least in the recent\r\nforms, are very long and are quite movable. Those of the next five cervical\r\nvertebrae are firmly fixed, short, and adze-shaped. The eighth and ninth\r\nare again long, and make the transition to the thoracic ribs, which are\r\nmostly eight in number, some with uncinate processes. Then follow several\r\nshorter or floating ribs, mostly two or three pairs. The next following\r\nthree presacral vertebrae carry no ribs. The two sacral and the caudal ribs\r\nhave already been mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the vertebral column of recent Crocodiles, Alligators, {440}and\r\nGavials is composed of twenty-six precaudal vertebrae (namely, nine\r\ncervical, fifteen thoracic and lumbar, two sacral), and about thirty-four\r\nto forty or more caudal vertebrae. Individual variations, including\r\nlop-sided attachment of the iliac bones, are by no means uncommon.\r\n\r\nThe sternum remains cartilaginous. It consists of an anterior rhomboid\r\nportion, which carries the coracoids and two pairs of ribs, and a posterior\r\nlonger and narrower portion formed by the median fusion of the next\r\nfollowing five or six ribs. Posteriorly the sternum bifurcates, each half\r\ncarrying two or three ribs, of which the last sometimes loses its proximal\r\nconnexion, and thus appears as a xiphisternal process. Ventrally, upon the\r\nanterior part of the sternum lies the longitudinal, originally paired,\r\nepisternum. The shoulder-girdle consists of the coracoids and the scapulae,\r\nwhich fuse with each other into one bony piece on each side. A pre-coracoid\r\nis indicated in fossil forms by a notch in the coracoid.\r\n\r\nThe space between the posterior end of the sternum and the pubic bones is\r\noccupied by the so-called abdominal sternum, composed of seven pairs of\r\nossifications, resting upon the ventral side of the rectus abdominis\r\nmuscle. Each pair consists of two closely apposed pieces, while the right\r\nand left remain separate in the median line. The last pair is much stronger\r\nthan the rest, is more deeply imbedded in the rectus muscle, and is loosely\r\nconnected with the anterior margin of the two \"pubic\" bones.\r\n\r\nThe limbs are built upon the typical terrestrial pentadactyle type, but\r\nwere in the Jurassic species undoubtedly more adapted to swimming\r\nlocomotion. The fore-limbs were conspicuously shorter and smaller than the\r\nhind-limbs, and it is only since Tertiary times that the difference has\r\ndecreased to a great extent. Ulna and radius remain separate. The proximal\r\nrow of carpal bones consists now of the ulnare and radiale, both strong and\r\ndistinctly elongated. On the outer side, between ulna and ulnare, lies a\r\npisiform bone. Upon the radiale follows a compound bone, often imperfectly\r\nossified towards the median side, and consisting of the first distal\r\ncarpal, the centrale, and the intermedium. The third, fourth, and fifth\r\ncarpals are fused into one mass. The second distal carpal remains separate.\r\nAll five fingers are present and well developed. The number of phalanges of\r\nthe pollex is two, of {441}the others three, four, four and three\r\nrespectively. During the embryonic development the number of phalanges of\r\nthe fourth and fifth finger increases temporarily, to as many as seven on\r\nthe fourth, to five or six on the fifth finger. Before the young animal is\r\nhatched the numbers are reduced again, chiefly by fusion of adjoining\r\nphalanges. This hyperphalangeal condition, typical of Plesiosauri,\r\nIchthyosauri, Cetacea, and several other absolutely aquatic animals,\r\nnaturally suggests the descent of the present Crocodiles from more\r\nessentially aquatic ancestors, but hitherto no trace of supernumerary\r\nphalanges has been found in any Jurassic Eusuchia, nor in the Parasuchia\r\nand Pseudosuchia.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the pelvis is difficult to understand. It consists in\r\nthe adult stage of three separate bones, of which two only partake in the\r\nformation of the acetabulum. The broad ilium sends out two processes; the\r\nposterior and stronger articulates with the ischium, which sends out a\r\nshort and stout process towards the anterior process of the ilium,\r\nenclosing a foramen. This process contains a separate centre of\r\nossification, possibly homologous with the true pubis, while each\r\nclub-shaped bone, loosely attached to it and directed forwards, generally\r\ncalled the pubis of the Crocodiles, would then be equivalent to an\r\nepipubis. Neither the \"pubes\" nor the ischia form a ventral median\r\nsymphysis.\r\n\r\nThe femur is devoid of a prominent inner trochanter. Tibia and fibula are\r\nof almost equal strength. The tarsal elements are, in the adult, reduced by\r\nfusion to five bones. The fibulare is transformed into a typically\r\nprojecting, heel-shaped calcaneum, while the intermedium is fused with the\r\ntibiale into a broad astragalus. The first, second, and third distal\r\ntarsalia are much reduced towards the inner side, and form one\r\nwedge-shaped, partly cartilaginous mass. The fourth tarsale lies between\r\nthe fibulare and the fourth metatarsal, while the fifth tarsale is\r\nhook-shaped and loosely attached to the outer side of the fourth. It has\r\nlost its metatarsal and the rest of the fifth finger. Embryos are\r\nhyperphalangeal, the fourth toe developing six phalanges, and there are\r\ntraces of the fifth toe. The numbers are ultimately reduced to 2, 3, 4, 4,\r\n0 on the five toes. The fourth toe remains without a claw.\r\n\r\nSKIN.–The epidermal horny layer is not shed periodically nor in pieces; the\r\nwear and tear is made good imperceptibly. The {442}scales, which cover the\r\nwhole body, have a hard, horny, waterproof covering, but between them the\r\nskin is soft. Each scale of the sides, belly, and tail, and especially\r\nthose of the lower jaw, shows a little dot or pit. At this spot the\r\nepidermis is not cornified or thickened, and a nerve with sensory\r\ncorpuscles ends beneath the bottom of the pit. Sometimes these pits are\r\nfilled with débris of cells, and on the lower jaw, especially on the chin,\r\nthese organs, instead of forming pits, are raised into little wartlike\r\nprominences.\r\n\r\nThe scutes or dermal portions of the scales consist of thickened, cutaneous\r\nconnective tissue, and are more or less extensively ossified, thus forming\r\na proper dermal armour. In most recent Crocodilia the armour is restricted\r\nto the back, with occasional osseous plates on the throat, as in\r\n_Osteolaemus_; regular although thin ossifications in the ventral scutes\r\noccur in the Caimans only. The Crocodile and Alligator skins of commerce\r\nconsist entirely of the tanned cutis, minus the epidermis and the horny\r\ncoverings of the scutes. In some fossil genera the ventral armour was\r\nextensively developed, especially in _Teleosaurus_, in some genera to the\r\nexclusion of dorsal ossifications. The armour of the recent forms consists,\r\nso far as the large scutes are concerned, of a considerable number of\r\nscutes, which are arranged in transverse rows, each row corresponding with\r\none skeletal segment of the trunk proper. Mostly there is a detached\r\ncluster of scutes on the back of the neck. On the trunk some of the scutes\r\nare larger and more crested than others, and form in their totality a\r\nvariable number of longitudinal rows. The median pair is generally the most\r\nconspicuous on the back. Some of the more lateral rows of keeled scutes\r\nconverge more and more towards the tail, the inner rows drop out\r\nimperceptibly, and two lateral rows combine on the middle of the tail into\r\nan unpaired series of vertical blades. These are no longer bony, but show\r\nmore strongly developed horny sheaths; they are very flexible, and\r\ntransform the tail into an effective propelling organ.\r\n\r\nMost of the larger scutes and the upper surface of the bones of the skull\r\nhave a peculiar gnawed-out, almost honeycombed appearance, as is usual\r\nwherever most of the cutis itself is transformed into bone or co-ossifies\r\nwith underlying bone, while the uppermost layers and the horny layer of the\r\nepidermis are much reduced and thinned out.\r\n\r\n{443}All the recent Crocodilia possess two pairs of skin-glands, both\r\nsecreting musk. One pair is situated on the throat, on the inner side of\r\nthe right and left half of the lower jaw. The opening of the gland, visible\r\nfrom below (see the figure of _Crocodilus niloticus_, p. 461), is\r\nslit-like, and leads into a pocket, which in large specimens is of the size\r\nof a walnut; the bag is filled with a smeary pale brownish substance, a\r\nconcentrated essence of musk, much prized by natives. The secretion is most\r\nactive during the rutting time, when the glands are partly everted. My\r\nyoung Crocodiles and Alligators often turned them inside out, like the\r\nfinger of a glove, when they were taken up and held by force. The other\r\npair lies within the lips of the cloacal slit, and is not visible from the\r\noutside. The use of these strongly scented organs, which are possessed by\r\nboth sexes, is obviously hedonic. The sexes are probably able to follow and\r\nfind each other, thanks to the streak of scented water left behind each\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nThe TONGUE is flat and thick, attached by its whole under-surface, so that\r\nit can be elevated but not protruded. It fills the whole space between the\r\ntwo halves of the lower jaw behind their symphysis. The dorsal surface\r\nshows numerous irregular polygonal fields, in the middle of most of which\r\nopens the duct of a large mucous gland. Tactile and gustatory corpuscles\r\nare scattered over the surface in the shape of tiny wartlike elevations.\r\nThe hinder margin of the tongue is raised into a transverse fold, which, by\r\nmeeting a similar fold from the palate, the velum palatinum, can shut off\r\nthe mouth completely from the deep and wide cavity of the throat, which\r\nleads of course into the gullet. Dorsally the choanae open into this\r\ncavity; and since the narial passages are transformed into long tubes,\r\ncompletely surrounded by bone, Crocodiles can lie submerged in the water,\r\nwith only the nostrils exposed and with the mouth open, and breathe without\r\nwater entering the windpipe. The opening of the latter, the glottis, is a\r\nlongitudinal slit, protected by the laryngeal cartilages, opened and closed\r\nby muscles. There is also a pair of membranous folds within the glottis,\r\nwhich serve as vocal cords. Ventrally below the larynx lies the\r\ncartilaginous, broad, shield-shaped hyoid; on the sides are attached the\r\nshort hyoid horns. The TRACHEA is long, consists of about sixty or more\r\ncomplete cartilaginous rings, and divides into two short bronchi, likewise\r\nprotected by complete rings. The trachea is depressed; its transverse\r\ndiameter decreases {444}from the glottis backwards. The LUNGS have attained\r\na high degree of efficiency. Each lung is an oval sac, and is transformed\r\ninto a complicated system of tubes, at the end of which are the countless\r\nhoneycomb-like respiratory cells, the whole lung being spongy. The main\r\nbronchus is continued straight down to the posterior end of the lung, and\r\nsends off during its course regular secondary bronchi, and these send off\r\ntertiary bronchi. The whole arrangement is very regular, the tubes coming\r\noff like rows of organ-pipes. Each lung hangs freely in the thoracic\r\ncavity. Besides its ventral attachment by its arteries, veins, and the\r\nbronchus, it is connected by loose tissue with the liver and the\r\npericardial septum. Each half of the thoracic cavity is partitioned off\r\nfrom the abdominal cavity by a strong transverse mesenteric lamella. The\r\npartition between the lungs and the stomach is at first simple, it then\r\ndivides, to enclose the liver; the anterior partition passing between liver\r\nand lung to the inner surface of the sternum; the posterior lamella between\r\nthe liver and the stomach. Both meet on the ventral surface of the liver,\r\nand are continued into or attached to the peculiar \"diaphragmatic\" muscle.\r\nThis is covered by the internal rectus muscle of the abdomen, arising from\r\nthe last pair of abdominal ribs near the pubic bones; it is innervated by a\r\nbranch of the last precrural nerve, and extends as a broad but thin\r\nmuscular sheath (always within and unconnected with the abdominal wall) to\r\nthe ventral posterior vein of the liver; thence it is continued as an\r\naponeurosis, together with the peritoneal lamella mentioned above, to the\r\ninner surface of the sternum. Contraction of this singular muscle\r\nindirectly widens the pulmonary cavity, and thereby directly aids\r\ninspiration. It acts consequently like the diaphragm or midriff of Mammals,\r\nalthough it is morphologically an entirely different muscle.\r\n\r\nThe STOMACH is smaller than one might expect from the fact that large\r\nCrocodiles can eat up nearly a whole man; but a great deal of their prey is\r\nstowed away preliminarily in the wide gullet until the rapid, powerful\r\ndigestion, which dissolves every bone, makes room in the stomach. This\r\nconsists of a wide, somewhat globular gizzard, rather muscular, with a pair\r\nof tendinous centres like those of birds, and a much smaller pyloric,\r\nglobular, more glandular compartment. It leads into the duodenum, which is\r\ncoiled up into a double loop, and receives at its end the {445}hepatic and\r\npancreatic ducts. The small intestine is narrow, and is stowed away in a\r\nfew irregular coils; the rectum is wide; a caecum is absent.\r\n\r\nThe CLOACA is peculiar. The coprodaeum and urodaeum, cf. p. 498, are\r\nconfluent, and form a wide, oval bag, closed in front and behind by strong\r\nsphincters, and it acts normally as a urinary receptacle. In the dorsal\r\nwall open the two ureters; a little towards the sides, and ventrally, open\r\nthe two oviducts, on the right and left, near the base of the clitoris.\r\nThen follows a transverse, soft, muscular fold, which shuts off this cavity\r\nfrom the proctodaeum or outermost chamber. In the latter is stowed away the\r\nrather large copulatory organ. It arises out of the medio-ventral wall of\r\nthe cloaca, and has a deep, longitudinal groove on its morphologically\r\ndorsal side for the conduction of the sperma, the vasa deferentia opening\r\nnear its basal end. On either side of the root of this organ, in both sexes\r\nalike, opens a peritoneal canal, wide enough in large specimens to pass a\r\ngoose-quill. The outer opening of the cloaca forms a longitudinal slit;\r\nwithin it, dorso-laterally, are the openings of the two anal musk-glands.\r\n\r\nThe KIDNEYS are much lobed. The testes are long and oval; the ovaries are\r\nmuch elongated and flat; and the eggs contained therein in great numbers\r\nare extremely small, except those which ripen during the time of\r\npropagation.\r\n\r\nThe VASCULAR SYSTEM has attained the highest state of development of all\r\nreptiles. The heart is practically quadrilocular, the partition between the\r\nright and left ventricle being complete; but there is still a small\r\ncommunication, the foramen Panizzae, which lies in the middle of the wall\r\ncommon to both aortae, where they leave their respective ventricles. The\r\nleft aortic arch conveys all the arterialised blood out of the left\r\nventricle, and supplies head, neck, trunk, and tail. The right aortic arch,\r\ncoming from the right ventricle, supplies venous blood, mixed with what\r\nlittle arterial blood it receives through the foramen Panizzae, to most of\r\nthe viscera. On a level with the stomach both descending aortic arches are\r\nstill connected with each other; the left aorta supplies most of the gut;\r\nthe right, the trunk and the kidneys.\r\n\r\nThe outer EAR lies in a recess, dorsally overhung by the lateral edge of\r\nthe bony squamoso-postfrontal bridge; and this {446}carries a flap of skin,\r\nprovided with muscles, to close the ear tightly. The tympanic membrane is\r\nvisible at the bottom of the recess; shining through it is part of that\r\ncartilage which is homologous with the malleus of the auditory ossicular\r\nchain; the outward extension of the latter on its way to the mandible,\r\nbehind the joint, passes as a partly cartilaginous string through the\r\nslit-like hole which is visible at the back of the skull, between the\r\nquadrate and the latero-occipital wing.\r\n\r\nThe EYES have, besides the lower and upper lid, a third, the nictitating\r\nmembrane, which can be drawn over the front of the eyeball. In the upper\r\nlid lies a cup-shaped bony plate of variable size. The pupil contracts into\r\na vertical slit. The iris is greenish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.–Map to illustrate the present distribution of\r\nCrocodilia.]\r\n\r\nThe recent GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION of the various kinds of Crocodilia\r\nloses its mystery when we recollect that during the Tertiary period\r\nAlligators, Crocodiles, and long-snouted Gavials existed in Europe. The\r\nsolitary species of Alligator in China is the last living reminder of their\r\nformer Periarctic distribution. The group, taken as a whole, is otherwise\r\nnow intertropical, Crocodiles alone inhabiting the Palaeo-tropical region,\r\ntogether with long-snouted forms in the Oriental sub-region, while\r\nAlligators and Caimans, with a few Crocodiles, live in America.\r\n\r\nThey are all rapacious, doing much damage by their predatory habits, and\r\nare fierce and sulky in temper. But the danger to man differs much in\r\ndifferent countries. While Crocodiles are dreaded in some localities, they\r\nare in others considered almost harmless, and men swim through the haunted\r\nwaters without hesitation. It seems as if certain old and wily individuals\r\nturn into man-eaters, just like tigers and lions.\r\n\r\n{447}Their home is the water, in which they pass the night, their time of\r\nhunting. The prey is either patiently watched or stalked, and nothing falls\r\namiss. Water-birds are seized by the beast, which rises imperceptibly from\r\nbelow. Some species are said to make use of their powerful tails for\r\nhitting the victim and even jerking it into the mouth. The strength of\r\ntheir jaws is enormous, and they do not let go what they have seized,\r\nunless, in the case of a man, he has the presence of mind and the\r\nopportunity to dig his fingers into the monster's eyes whilst being dragged\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIn the morning they crawl on to sandbanks, or on to logs of wood, which\r\nthey closely resemble, in order to bask, mostly in such a position that on\r\nthe slightest alarm they can plunge into the water. For this reason they\r\nfrequently make a half circle before they settle down to rest, with the\r\nheads turned towards the river. There they bask all day long, apparently\r\nfast asleep, often with gaping mouths. But their sense of hearing and of\r\nsight is sharp, and they learn from experience, old individuals being by\r\nfar the most wary. Commercially the skins are now of considerable value.\r\nThe flesh is white, and is tolerable eating but for the combination of\r\nfishy and musky odour, which, although faint, is not to everybody's liking.\r\n\r\nAll the species have a voice, a kind of loud, short bark or croak, heard at\r\nnight and when angered. The female lays several dozen or even three score\r\nwhite, oval, hard-shelled eggs in the sand, well out of the reach of\r\nmoisture; and some species construct an elaborate kind of nest. The mother\r\nwatches it, takes care of and fights for her offspring, numbers of which\r\nfall an easy prey to large storks, fishes, and to the stronger members of\r\ntheir own kind.\r\n\r\nIn the cooler countries they hibernate in the ground; and in hot countries,\r\nwhich are subject to drought, some kinds aestivate in the hardened mud; or\r\nthey migrate. When during a prolonged drought on the island of Marajó, at\r\nthe mouth of the Amazon, the swamps and lakes were dried up, the Alligators\r\nmigrated towards the nearest rivers, and many perished in the attempt. On\r\none farm were found 8500 dead, and at the end of Lake Arary more than 4000.\r\nSuch occurrences in bygone times may perhaps explain the masses of bones\r\nfound here and there in a fossil state.\r\n\r\n{448}The age to which Crocodiles can live is quite beyond calculation. They\r\nare capable of propagation long before they are anything like half-grown,\r\nmaybe at an age of little more than ten years; then they continue to grow\r\nperhaps for more than one hundred years, until they die.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to divide the Eusuchia, most of which are extinct, into a\r\nlongirostral and a brevirostral section. In the former the snout is much\r\nelongated and narrow, and the nasal bones, although they are sometimes very\r\nlong, do not reach the nasal groove. The mandibular symphysis is very long,\r\nand is formed not only by the dentary but also by the splenial bones. In\r\nthe brevirostral section the snout is shorter, sometimes broad and rounded\r\noff, and the nasal bones are supposed to reach the nasal groove, or at\r\nleast to approach it very nearly; the mandibular symphysis is formed by the\r\ndentaries only. But these distinctions are quite arbitrary, and there exist\r\nall kinds of intermediate forms. For instance, in _Goniopholis_ and\r\n_Diplocynodon_, which are both undoubtedly near allies of the recent\r\nCrocodiles and Alligators, the nasal bones are considerably removed from\r\nthe nasal groove; and in _Crocodilus cataphractus_ they are separated even\r\nfrom the premaxilla by the medio-dorsal suture of the maxillaries. Again,\r\nin _Goniopholis_ the mandibular symphysis is so long that it comprises part\r\nof the splenial bones. Both typically long- and short-snouted forms occur\r\nalready in the Upper Oolite, but in the Lower Jurassic age only\r\nlong-snouted kinds seem to have existed. The latter cannot easily be\r\nconnected with _Belodon_, one of the Parasuchia, on account of the position\r\nof the nostrils; the mere shortening of the long premaxillaries of\r\n_Belodon_ would not transfer its distinctly paired nostrils to the anterior\r\nend of the premaxilla. To account for the position of the nasal groove in\r\nthe Eusuchia, we have to go back to a primitive condition, such as that of\r\nthe Pseudosuchian _Aëtosaurus_, and this consideration shows that the\r\nParasuchia and Eusuchia are collateral branches.\r\n\r\nThe Eusuchia have been split into many families. Zittel, for instance,\r\ndivides them into ten, some of them on insufficient grounds, since there\r\nare too many intermediate forms; and more, sometimes quite unexpected,\r\nmodifications are still being found. Several of the accepted families\r\nrepresent collateral or convergent lines of development.\r\n\r\n{449}[Illustration: FIG. 105.–Group of Crocodiles. A long-snouted Gharial\r\nor Gavial (_Gavialis gangeticus_) on the top of _Crocodilus acutus_; a Nile\r\nCrocodile (_C. vulgaris_) in the foreground; _C. palustris_, a \"Mugger,\" in\r\nthe right upper corner. Observe the peculiar floating attitude of the young\r\nspecimen.]\r\n\r\n{450}There is the same tendency to transfer the choanae further back, owing\r\nto the formation of a solid secondary roofing in of the mouth, to transform\r\nthe amphicoelous into procoelous vertebrae, to reduce the supratemporal\r\nforamina, and to obtain a better development of the dorsal armour, whilst\r\nthat on the ventral side is gradually reduced. Lastly, there is a tendency\r\ntowards a shortening and broadening of the snout, a condition which has\r\nreached its culmination in the Alligators, while the Gavials are survivals\r\nof another branch. The notches in the premaxilla, for the reception of some\r\nof the lower teeth, have also been acquired independently. Although the\r\nrecent Crocodilia cannot now, as has been pointed out by Boulenger, be\r\nseparated into different families, no valid diagnoses being possible owing\r\nto the existence of _Tomistoma_, their phylogeny shows them to belong to at\r\nleast two heterogeneous groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY TO THE GENERA OF RECENT CROCODILIA.\r\n\r\n  I.

TELEOSAURIDAE, in the Lias and Oolite of Europe; marine.–Snout very\r\nlong and slender. Nasals widely separated from the premaxillae by the\r\nmaxillaries. Choanae at the posterior end of the palatines. In front of the\r\neye a small sub-lacrymal foramen. Supratemporal foramina large. Vertebrae\r\namphicoelous. Anterior limbs scarcely half as long as the posterior pair.\r\nThe dermal armour consists of two rows of broad scutes on the back, while\r\nthe belly is protected by a shield of numerous bony scutes, which are\r\nconnected with each other by sutures. Teeth numerous and rather slender.\r\nGeneral appearance like that of Gavials.\r\n\r\n{451}_Teleosaurus_ of the Middle and Upper Oolite in England and France.\r\nSnout very slender. Nasals narrow and short. The under side is protected by\r\na beautifully finished armour, consisting of a square breast-shield of four\r\nrows of bony scutes, and a larger, long, oval shield on the belly, with\r\nabout six longitudinal and seventeen transverse rows of scutes.\r\n\r\n_Mystriosaurus_, of the Upper Lias in France and Germany, reached a length\r\nof 15 feet, and is characterised by an additional series of keeled but\r\nsmaller caudal plates running parallel with the middle pairs, which are\r\nneatly sutured together.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. METRIORHYNCHIDAE, in the Upper Oolite of Europe; marine.–Nasals\r\nbroad posteriorly, sometimes extending with a pointed wedge very near the\r\npremaxillae. Without sub-lacrymal foramina. Eyes with a ring of\r\nossifications in the sclerotic. Dermal armour unknown. Vertebrae and\r\nchoanae like those of the previous family. _Metriorhynchus_ and\r\n_Geosaurus_.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. MACRORHYNCHIDAE, in the freshwater deposits of the Purbeck,\r\nWealden, and Greensand of Europe. Snout long and slender. The nasals are\r\nnarrow, and so elongated that they meet a similar long extension of the\r\npremaxillaries. Choanae between the palatines and pterygoids. Vertebrae\r\namphicoelous. Dermal armour consisting of two imbricating dorsal and eight\r\nventral rows, e.g. _Pholidosaurus_ of the English Wealden.\r\n\r\nFAM. 4. GAVIALIDAE.–Snout long and slender. The choanae are situated\r\nentirely within the pterygoids. Vertebrae procoelous. Members of this\r\nfamily make their first appearance in the littoral marine deposits of the\r\nUpper Chalk of Europe and North America; others are common in tertiary,\r\nmarine, and freshwater deposits, whilst only two genera and species occur\r\nnow in the Oriental sub-region.\r\n\r\n_Thoracosaurus_ in the Upper Chalk of New Jersey and France and Belgium is\r\nintermediate between _Gavialis_ and _Tomistoma_. The prefrontal bones are\r\nvery small, while the lacrymals are very long and surround the nasals\r\nposteriorly. The nasals themselves are slender, and reach the posterior\r\nlikewise long and narrow prolongations of the premaxillaries.\r\n\r\n_Gavialis._–The snout is extremely long and slender. The mandibular\r\nsymphysis is so long that it comprises a great portion of the splenial\r\nbones, and extends backwards almost to the level of the last teeth and to\r\nthe palatal foramina. The nasal {452}bones are very short, and are\r\nseparated from the premaxillaries by the long suture of the maxillaries.\r\nAbout twenty-eight upper and twenty-five lower teeth on each side.\r\n\r\n_G. gangeticus_, the only recent species, is essentially Indian, inhabiting\r\nchiefly the basins of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus; it occurs also in\r\nthe Mahanadi of Orissa and in Arakan, but does not live in the Irrawaddy,\r\nnor in the Narbada, Kistna, and farther south. In spite of its great size,\r\nwhich reaches 20 feet or even more, it is harmless, and lives entirely upon\r\nfish; hence its Hindustani name, _gharial_, meaning fish-eater, of which\r\nthe generic name is a corruption.\r\n\r\nThe nuchal and dorsal scutes form a continuous shield, but there are two\r\nsmall postoccipital scutes. General colour, dark olive-brown above; the\r\nyoung are paler, with dark markings. The male is remarkable for several\r\npeculiarities. The nose is very much swollen, and can be inflated like a\r\nbag when the nostrils are closed. In connexion herewith, probably produced\r\nby the recoil of the air in the long narial passages towards the choanae or\r\nposterior nares, there is a pair of hollow globular swellings, in large\r\nspecimens of the size of a goose's egg. The shell of these globes is formed\r\nby the dorsal wings of the palatine bones above the floor of the choanae,\r\nand they extend forwards to the right and left of the ethmoid almost to the\r\nvertical downward process of the prefrontals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.–Skull of _Gavialis gangeticus_ (the Gharial). × ⅛.\r\n_F_, frontal; _J_, jugal; _L_, lacrymal; _Mand_, mandible; _Mx_, maxillary;\r\n_Na_, nasal; _Par_, parietal; _Pm.c_, premaxillary; _Prf_, prefrontal;\r\n_Ptf_, postfrontal; _Qj_, quadrato-jugal; _Sq_, squamosal.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the Gharial is common enough, we know next to nothing about its\r\nhabits, and in zoological gardens it is rather rare. A. Anderson[139] has,\r\nhowever, made the following observations. Forty eggs were dug out of the\r\nsand, where they were {453}lying in two tiers, twenty below and twenty\r\nabove, with a foot of sand between. The young ran with amazing rapidity the\r\nmoment they were hatched. Some of them actually bit his fingers before he\r\nhad time to remove the shell from their bodies! The length of these\r\nnew-born creatures was 15 to 16 inches, 9 of which belonged to the long and\r\nslender tail.\r\n\r\nSeveral fossil species have been described from the Pliocene deposits of\r\nthe Sivalik Hills of India; and in the same district occurred the closely\r\nallied _Rhamphosuchus crassidens_, which reached the gigantic length of\r\nabout 50 feet!\r\n\r\n_Tomistoma._–The general configuration of the skull and snout is that of\r\n_Gavialis_, but the nasal bones are long and reach the premaxillaries,\r\nalthough not the nasal groove, thereby separating the maxillaries. The\r\nfirst and fourth mandibular teeth fit into notches of the upper jaw, while\r\nmost of the others fit into pits between the teeth of the upper jaw. About\r\ntwenty upper and eighteen lower teeth on each side.\r\n\r\n_T. schlegeli_, the only species, reaches a length of 15 feet; it inhabits\r\nthe rivers and swamps of Borneo, Malacca, and Sumatra. Fossil specimens of\r\n_Tomistoma_ have been found in the Miocene of Malta and Sardinia.\r\n_Gavialosuchus_ of the Miocene of Hungary is closely allied.\r\n\r\nFAM. 5. ATOPOSAURIDAE.–The few members of this family, _Atoposaurus_,\r\n_Alligatorium_, and _Alligatorellus_, lived in the Upper Oolitic period of\r\nFrance, and were small, about one foot in length. The vertebrae are\r\namphicoelous. The nasal groove is divided by a prolongation of the nasal\r\nbones. The head is short, and in its general shape rather like that of a\r\nlizard.\r\n\r\nFAM. 6. GONIOPHOLIDAE, in the Purbeck and Wealden of Europe and the\r\ncorresponding level of North America. The vertebrae are amphicoelous. The\r\nchoanae are still elongated but are situated between the palatines and\r\npterygoids. The premaxillaries are rather large, and each sends a broad\r\ntriangular process between the nasal and maxillary. The nasals are broad\r\nand are well separated from the nasal groove. The splenials help to form\r\nthe mandibular symphysis.\r\n\r\n_Goniopholis._–The general configuration of the skull is rather like that\r\nof _Crocodilus vulgaris_. There is a pair of deep notches in the upper jaw\r\nfor the reception of the lower canine teeth. _G. simus_ and _G. crassidens_\r\nin England and continental Europe, and {454}others in Colorado, were\r\nlarge-sized Crocodiles, some with a skull 2 feet in length. The dermal\r\narmour consisted of a pair of dorsal rows, a thoracic and an abdominal\r\nshield, composed as in the Teleosauridae of six to eight longitudinal\r\nsutured rows.\r\n\r\nFAM. 7. CROCODILIDAE.–Beginning in the Upper Cretaceous period of Europe\r\nand North America, many forms of Crocodiles, Alligators, and Caimans\r\nexisted in the Tertiary period in America, Europe, and India; persisting in\r\nEurope until the Plistocene. The vertebrae are procoelous. The choanae are\r\ncompletely surrounded by the pterygoids. The nasals reach the nasal groove,\r\nexcept in _Crocodilus cataphractus_. The orbits are larger than the small\r\nsupratemporal fossae, and always continuous superficially with the lateral\r\ntemporal fossae, the postfronto-jugal bridge not reaching the surface. The\r\ndorsal armour consists of more than one pair of longitudinal rows, while\r\nthe ventral armour is much reduced in thickness or absent.\r\n\r\n_Diplocynodon._–Common in the Oligocene and Miocene of Europe, e.g. _D.\r\nhastingsiae_. The skull resembles that of the Alligators, but has a pair of\r\nlateral notches in the premaxilla for the reception of the third, and\r\nsometimes also of the fourth mandibular tooth. The ventral armour is still\r\nrather strong.\r\n\r\n_Crocodilus._–The fourth mandibular tooth fits, as a rule, into a notch in\r\nthe upper jaw. The other teeth are more or less interlocked with those of\r\nthe other jaw. The fifth upper tooth is the largest. The nasal bones form\r\nthe posterior border of the nasal groove, but do not extend into it as a\r\nseptum. The bony scutes of the dorsal shield are keeled, and stand closely\r\ntogether, being rarely united by suture; and they form from four to six\r\nprincipal rows.\r\n\r\nCrocodiles have occurred since the Upper Chalk in Europe; many species\r\nexisted in the Tertiary epoch in Europe and North America, decreasing in\r\nnumbers in the Pliocene and disappearing with the beginning of the\r\nPlistocene. About ten recent species are known, and these have now a\r\nsomewhat scattered distribution; namely, three species in Africa, one of\r\nthem extending into Syria; three in tropical America and the West Indian\r\nIslands; the rest in the Malay, Indian, and North Australian countries.\r\n\r\n_C. palustris._–The \"Mugger\" of India. The premaxillo-maxillary suture is\r\ntransverse, as in the Alligators. The adults {455}retain the five teeth in\r\neach half of the premaxilla. The mandibular symphysis is short, extending\r\nonly to the level of the fourth or fifth tooth. The snout is stout, rather\r\nbroad; the top of the head is rough but without any ridges. The upper and\r\nlower jaw each contain nineteen teeth on either side. The nuchal scutes,\r\nsix in number, are packed closely together, the four biggest forming a\r\nsquare. Four smaller scutes are arranged in a curved line on the occiput.\r\nThe dorsal shield is composed of four, sometimes of six rows of larger\r\nscutes, of which the central pair is the broadest. The fingers are webbed\r\nat the base; the outer toes are broadly webbed, and the outer edge of the\r\nhind-limbs is turned into a serrated fringe. The general colour of the\r\nupper parts is dark olive-brown; the young are pale, with black spots. The\r\nlength of twelve feet is considered a fair average size for a large\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.–Dorsal view of the skull of _Crocodilus\r\npalustris_. × ⅛. The arrangement of the nuchal scutes is shown in the upper\r\nleft-hand corner; _E_, position of the ear-flap.]\r\n\r\nThis, the \"Marsh Crocodile,\" has a wide distribution. It inhabits the\r\nrivers, ponds, tanks, and marshes of India and Ceylon, extending eastwards\r\nthrough Burma and Malacca into most of the Malay islands, westwards into\r\nBeluchistan. This species is frequently venerated by the Hindoos, and is\r\nkept in a kind of domesticated condition, attended by fakirs. One of the\r\nmost famous crocodile ponds, the so-called \"mugger-peer,\" lies in an oasis\r\nof the sandy stretches to the north-west of Karachi. A. L. Adams has\r\ndescribed a visit to this pond.[140]\r\n\r\n\"The greater pond is about 300 yards in circumference, and contains many\r\nlittle grassy islands, on which the majority of the Crocodiles were then\r\nbasking; some were asleep on its slimy sides, others half submerged in the\r\nmuddy water, while now and then a huge monster would raise himself upon his\r\ndiminutive legs, and waddling for a few paces, fall flat on his belly.\r\nYoung ones, {456}from a foot in length and upwards, ran nimbly along the\r\nmargin of the pond, disappearing suddenly in the turbid waters as soon as\r\nwe approached. The largest crocodile lives in a long narrow tank separated\r\nfrom the others. The fakirs, and natives who worship in the neighbouring\r\ntemples, have painted his forehead red; they venerate the old monster,\r\nmaking a salaam to his majesty whenever he shows himself above water. A\r\nhandsome young Beloochee, whose occupation it was to feed the animals,\r\ninformed us that this specimen was upwards of 200 years old, and that by\r\nway of a 'tit-bit' he was in the habit of devouring the young crocodiles.\r\nDuring our visit this enormous brute was asleep on the bank of his\r\ndwelling-place, and seemed quite indifferent to our presence, although we\r\ncame within a foot of him, and even attempted to arouse him by rubbing his\r\nnose with a leg of goat's flesh, which, however, a young one greedily\r\nseized. Our attendant tried in vain to excite their ferocity, but beyond a\r\nfeeble attempt to snap their trenchant teeth, the animals showed no\r\ndisposition to attack us.\r\n\r\n\"A pony was wading about in the pond and feeding on the grassy hillocks,\r\nbut the crocodiles took no notice of him.\r\n\r\n\"The crocodiles dig deep in the sand, under the neighbouring date-trees,\r\nand there deposit their eggs. Quantities of deciduous teeth, of various\r\nsizes, were strewn along the slimy sides of the pond.\r\n\r\n\"Strangers are expected to stand treat, not only by the fakirs and natives,\r\nwho gain a livelihood by hanging about the pond and showing the monsters,\r\nbut even the crocodiles themselves seem to anticipate a feast, and on the\r\narrival of a party come out in unusual numbers. Accordingly, we had a goat\r\nslaughtered, during which operation the brutes seemed to rouse themselves,\r\nas if preparing for a rush. Then our guide, taking piece after piece of the\r\nflesh, dashed it on the bank, uttering a low growling sound, at which the\r\nwhole tank became in motion, and crocodiles, of whose existence we had been\r\nbefore ignorant, splashed through the shallow water, struggling which would\r\nseize the prize. The shore was literally covered with scaly monsters,\r\nsnapping their jaws at one another.\"\r\n\r\nSir J. Emerson Tennent[141] has had many opportunities of studying the\r\nhabits of the Marsh Crocodile. According to him {457}it is essentially\r\ncowardly in its instincts, and hastens to conceal itself on the approach of\r\nman. One of these creatures, which was overtaken in the jungle by a\r\ngentleman riding on horseback, fled to a shallow pool, and thrusting its\r\nhead into the mud till it covered up its eyes, remained motionless, in\r\nprofound confidence of perfect concealment.\r\n\r\n\"There is a popular belief that the crocodile is exceedingly sensitive to\r\ntickling, and that it will relax its hold of a man if he can only contrive\r\nto reach and rub with his hand the softer parts of its under side. An\r\nincident of some reality in this piece of folk-lore came under my own\r\nobservation. One morning ... we came suddenly upon a crocodile asleep under\r\nsome bushes of the buffalo-thorn, several hundred yards from the water. The\r\nterror of the poor wretch was extreme when it awoke and found itself\r\ndiscovered and completely surrounded. It was a hideous creature, upwards of\r\n10 feet long.... It started to its feet and turned round in a circle,\r\nhissing and clanking its bony jaws, with its ugly green eye intently fixed\r\nupon us. On being struck with a stick, it lay perfectly quiet and\r\napparently dead. Presently it looked cunningly round, and made a rush\r\ntowards the water, but on a second blow it lay again motionless and\r\nfeigning death. We tried to rouse it, but without effect; pulled its tail,\r\nslapped its back, struck its hard scales, and teased it in every way, but\r\nall in vain; nothing would induce it to move till, accidentally, my son,\r\nthen a boy of twelve years old, tickled it gently under the arm, and in an\r\ninstant it drew the limb close to its side and turned to avoid a repetition\r\nof the experiment. Again it was touched under the other arm, and the same\r\nemotion was exhibited, the great monster twisting about like an infant to\r\navoid being tickled.\"\r\n\r\nIn the dry season, when the tanks become exhausted, the Marsh Crocodiles\r\nhave occasionally been encountered in the jungle, wandering in search of\r\nwater. During a severe drought, in 1844, they deserted a tank near\r\nKornegalle, and traversed the town during the night, on their way to\r\nanother reservoir in the suburb; two or three fell into the wells; others,\r\nin their trepidation, laid eggs in the street, and some were found\r\nentangled in garden fences and killed.\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, during the extreme drought, when unable to procure\r\ntheir ordinary food from the drying up of the {458}watercourses, they bury\r\nthemselves in the mud and remain in a state of torpor till released by the\r\nrecurrence of rains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.–Dorsal view of the skull of _Crocodilus porosus_.\r\n× about ⅙. _Col_, buttress connecting the postfrontal with the jugal and\r\nectopterygoid; _F_, frontal; _Jg_, jugal; _Mx_, maxillary; _Na_, nasal;\r\n_P_, parietal; _Pm_, premaxilla; _Pof_, postfrontal; _Pr.f_, prefrontal;\r\n_Q_, quadrate; _Qj_, quadrato-jugal; _R_, the characteristic ridge on the\r\nprefrontal bone; _Sq_, squamosal; _T_, perforations in the premaxilla\r\ncaused by a pair of lower incisor teeth.]\r\n\r\n_C. porosus_ s. _biporcatus_.–The premaxillo-maxillary suture on the palate\r\ndoes not form a transverse line, but is W-shaped, and extends backwards as\r\nin the rest of the species of Crocodiles to be described. This Indian\r\nspecies is easily recognised by the prominent longitudinal ridge which\r\nextends in front of each eye, over the prefrontal bones, and by the absence\r\nof sub-occipital scutes. The nuchal scutes consist of four large ones,\r\nwhich form a square, and one or two smaller scutes on each side. The dorsal\r\nshield contains four to eight principal longitudinal rows. The digits,\r\nwebs, and the serrated fringe of the legs are like those of _C. palustris_.\r\nThe head and snout, however, are distinctly longer, and more slender in\r\nproportion, and the adult has only four teeth in each premaxilla. The\r\ngeneral colour is dark olive-brown. Young specimens, as usual, are much\r\npaler and are spotted with black.\r\n\r\nThis species attains a much larger size than the Marsh Crocodile. Specimens\r\nof 15 to 20 feet in length are not uncommon, and there is a record of one\r\nmonster of 33 feet. Consequently this is, both in bulk and length,\r\nundoubtedly the largest species of recent reptiles. It is essentially an\r\ninhabitant of tidal waters or estuaries, frequently entering salt water and\r\ngoing out to sea. Herewith corresponds its wide distribution, namely, the\r\nwhole coast of the Gulf of Bengal, extending to {459}Southern China, and\r\nacross the Malay Archipelago to the northern coasts of Australia. Eastwards\r\nit ranges to the Solomon Islands and even to Fiji. Curiously enough, it\r\ndoes not seem to occur on the west coast of India.\r\n\r\nAccording to Tennent it is ready to assail man when pressed by hunger, and\r\nthe same authority mentions the following serio-comic incident. A man was\r\nfishing, seated on the branch of a tree overhanging the water, and to\r\nshelter himself from the drizzling rain he covered his head and shoulders\r\nwith a bag folded into a shape common with the natives. While in this\r\nattitude, a leopard sprang upon him from the jungle, but missing its aim,\r\nseized the bag and not the man, and fell with it into the river. Here a\r\ncrocodile, which had been eyeing the angler in despair, seized the leopard\r\nas it fell, and sank with it to the bottom.\r\n\r\nI have had some personal experience in the bringing up of the young of this\r\nspecies. Two dozen of them had come from Ceylon when quite young, only one\r\nfoot long. At first they were very shy, and huddled together in their tank,\r\nbut they took food greedily–strips of fish and, later on, sheep's heart.\r\nWhen frightened they emitted peculiar, high-pitched, half-croaking sounds.\r\nSome of them snapped at the finger when touched; others were of a more\r\ngentle disposition; the shy ones were undoubtedly the most vicious. Within\r\none year they grew to 18 or 20 inches, and added much to their bulk. Then\r\nthey were transferred to a deeper and larger tank in a greenhouse, in which\r\nthey could roam about at liberty. In the daytime they dozed on the margins\r\nof their pond, mostly in such a position that, at the slightest alarm, they\r\ncould plunge back into the water. The strongest specimen left the tank\r\nentirely, and took up its favourite place for basking on the stump of a\r\ntree, to reach which it had to climb up a rough wall of stones. After three\r\nyears, several had grown to the length of three and a half, and even four\r\nfeet, and had by this time become formidable pets. Although handled\r\nfrequently, they never became tame, the only change in their behaviour\r\nbeing that, instead of rushing off in a fright, and hiding for half an hour\r\nat the bottom of the tank, they became more vicious and confident, making\r\nfor and snapping at the hand which fed them. The nights were spent\r\nregularly in the water, either floating {460}with just the nostrils\r\nexposed, or in search of food, frogs being their favourite prey, while\r\ntheir main sustenance consisted of \"lights,\" with an occasional mouse, or a\r\npiece of solid meat by way of an _entrée_. Small pieces were bolted. The\r\ntough \"lights,\" namely lungs with the windpipe and blood-vessels, were\r\ncauses of great quarrels. Two or three would get hold of a lump of this\r\nkind, tearing at it, and twisting and rolling over in opposite directions.\r\nThe supply of warm water came through a stout pipe of red india-rubber, and\r\nthis was an irresistible attraction to the crocodiles. On many a morning\r\nthe tube was found twisted into a knot, one of the creatures having spent\r\nhours in chewing it and in trying to wrench it off. In order to aid\r\ndigestion they swallowed pebbles. The most favourable temperature of the\r\nwater was 85° F.; if below 75° F. they refused to eat, but a continued\r\nexposure to 60° F. did not hurt them. When the temperature rose above 95°\r\nF. they left the water, although means had to be taken to prevent them from\r\nlying on the hot-water pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.–Dorsal view of the skull of a very old specimen of\r\n_Crocodilus niloticus_, in which most of the bony sutures are obliterated,\r\n× about ⅒.]\r\n\r\n_C. niloticus_ s. _vulgaris_.–The premaxillo-maxillary suture on the palate\r\nis W-shaped. The nasal bones form only a small part of the posterior border\r\nof the nasal groove. There are eighteen or nineteen upper and fifteen lower\r\nteeth on each side. In old specimens some of the anterior mandibular teeth\r\nperforate the premaxillae, as indicated in Fig. 109, and they even pierce\r\nthrough the integument so as to be visible from above. The nuchals are\r\ncomposed of four large scutes, with a smaller one on each side and\r\nsometimes one behind, and there is a row of smaller pieces across the\r\nocciput. The dorsal shield contains six to eight principal longitudinal\r\nrows. The fingers are webbed at the base; the outer toes are very broadly\r\nwebbed; and there is a serrated fringe on the outer side of the leg. The\r\ngeneral colour of the adult is dark olive-brown; the young are paler, with\r\nblack spots and vermiculations. The under parts are yellowish white.\r\n\r\n{461}The Nile Crocodile is essentially African, ranging from the Senegal to\r\nthe Cape and to Egypt. It is also very common in Madagascar. Nothing is\r\nknown about its occurrence in Arabia, but a few specimens of rather small\r\nsize seem still to exist in Syria, in the Wadi Zerka, an eastern tributary\r\nof the Jordan.\r\n\r\nEven in historical times the Crocodile must have been very common in lower\r\nEgypt, to judge from the number of mummies preserved by the old Egyptians.\r\nNow it is practically exterminated, and there are scarcely any left below\r\nWadi Halfa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.–Ventral view of a young _Crocodilus niloticus_,\r\nshowing the arrangement of the bony scutes and the two openings of the\r\nmusk-glands on the lower jaw. The upper right-hand figure shows on a larger\r\nscale the disposition of the nuchal scutes and the first row of dorsal\r\nscutes.]\r\n\r\nSuch a conspicuous and dangerous creature has naturally always enjoyed\r\nnotoriety. It is well described in one of the oldest writings of the world,\r\nthe Book of Job. \"Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue\r\nwith a cord which thou lettest down?... His scales are his pride, shut up\r\ntogether as with a close seal. One is so near to another, that no air can\r\ncome between them. They are joined one to another, they stick together,\r\nthat they cannot be sundered.... Lay thine hand upon him, remember the\r\nbattle, do no more.\" Bows and arrows, spears and clubs, are of little avail\r\nagainst such a {462}monster; the dragging out of a hooked, full-grown\r\nspecimen requires many men and is a formidable task. Of course firearms\r\nhave changed all this, and its invulnerability to bullets is nonsense. It\r\nis true that a bullet sent into the head is generally ineffective, since it\r\nis a hundred to one that the bullet does not hit the small brain, and even\r\nif it does, the creature sinks to the bottom and is lost to view until\r\ndecomposition sets in and the gases developing in the body cause it to\r\nfloat.\r\n\r\nHerodotus has quaint stories about these crocodiles and their worship.\r\nAmongst other stories he mentions that the bird _Trochilus_, supposed to be\r\nthe _Pluvianus aegyptius_, a kind of Plover, slips into the gaping mouth to\r\npick off the leeches which infest the reptile's gums. \"In Egypt it is\r\ncalled Champsa, but the Ionians call them κοκοδρίλοι on account of the\r\nresemblance to the lizards which live on their garden walls.\" This is in\r\nfact the origin of the name crocodile, κόρδυλος being the ancient Greek for\r\nlizard and newt. With reduplication κορκόρδυλος and by metathesis\r\nultimately κροκόδειλος. The Arabic name is _ledschun_.\r\n\r\nThe story about the Plover seems to be true. These birds are sometimes seen\r\nsitting upon basking crocodiles, and since the latter are in the habit of\r\nresting, perhaps half asleep, with the mouth wide open, it is possible that\r\nthese agile birds do pick their teeth, and that they, being also very\r\nwatchful, by their own cry of warning and by fluttering off on the approach\r\nof danger, give the alarm to the crocodiles and thus benefit them in more\r\nthan one way.\r\n\r\nBut the equally old story about the Ichneumon or Mongoose is an idle\r\ninvention. Mongooses are partial to eggs, but they certainly prefer those\r\nof hens and other birds to those of the crocodile, which are far too hard\r\nand strong to be broken by such a little animal. Moreover, as we shall see\r\npresently, the eggs are far too well concealed.\r\n\r\nThe best account of the habits of these crocodiles is the one given\r\nrecently by Voeltzkow,[142] who has spent a long time in Madagascar to\r\ncollect material for the study of their development.\r\n\r\nHe says that _C. niloticus_ is not only the most common reptile, but\r\nperhaps the most common vertebrate in Madagascar. {463}It occurs in every\r\npool and river in great numbers, especially upon the sandbanks of the\r\nBetsiboka River, where one may see more than one hundred within one hour's\r\npaddling down stream. The largest specimen measured by Voeltzkow was 13\r\nfeet long; the largest in the National Collection is a little less than 15\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe crocodiles are caught in various ways. The simplest apparatus consists\r\nof two pointed sticks, which are fastened cross-wise within the bait to\r\nwhich is attached a rope, and this is made fast on the bank of the river or\r\nlake. The animal, when it has once swallowed this spiked bait, keeps its\r\njaws firmly closed, so that it can be dragged out of the water. Another\r\nmethod is more reliable. A long and strong rope is made into an easily\r\nslipping noose, with an opening of about 18 inches. The bait is attached to\r\nthe upper part of the noose, while the lower portion is kept open by a\r\nspringy branch, the whole thing being so balanced that it will float\r\nupright. When a crocodile seizes the bait, which it does with a side jerk\r\nof the head, the branch falls out of the noose and the latter closes around\r\nthe upper or lower jaw.\r\n\r\nThese crocodiles dig long subterranean passages of 30 to 40 feet in length;\r\nthe passage opens in the bank below the level of the water, and gradually\r\nascending ends in a somewhat wider compartment, which allows the creature\r\nto turn round. Two or three air-holes are pierced through the ceiling of\r\nthe burrow, in which bones and other remains of food are often found, so\r\nthat the natives' belief, that the crocodiles retire into these chambers in\r\norder to devour their prey in undisturbed secrecy, appears very probable.\r\nWhen suddenly disturbed or frightened they take to these lairs, and since\r\ntheir position is clearly marked by the air-holes, the natives block the\r\npassage and then dig the animal out from above.\r\n\r\nEggs are laid, in Madagascar, from the end of August to the end of\r\nSeptember; the number of one set varies from twenty to thirty. They are\r\ndeposited in a nest. This is in the ground, mostly in white sand, and\r\nconsists of a hollow 18 inches to 2 feet deep. The walls are rather\r\nvertical, but near the bottom they are undermined, and here the eggs are\r\nplaced. The centre of the pit being somewhat higher, the eggs roll by\r\nthemselves into the undermined peripheral region. The laying takes place\r\n{464}during the night, mostly a little before daybreak. After one half of\r\nthe eggs has been laid, they are covered up with sand, whereupon the other\r\nhalf is deposited. Then the hole is completely filled up and no visible\r\ntraces are left behind; but the mother sleeps upon the nest and thus leads\r\nto its discovery. The position of the nest is so chosen that it cannot be\r\nreached by moisture from below; the eggs are most susceptible to moisture,\r\na very slight amount of which causes them to turn bad.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the eggs of one and the same clutch varies much, some being\r\nelliptical, others cylindrical with rounded off ends. Their size varies\r\nfrom 5.5 to 9 cm. in length, and 4 to 5 cm. in width. The shell is white\r\nand glossy, thick and hard, either roughly granular or smooth. They are\r\nhatched in about twelve weeks.\r\n\r\nVoeltzkow feels certain that the mother returns to the nest at the proper\r\ntime in order to dig the young ones out and to conduct them to the water.\r\nTo test this story he had a nest surrounded with a fence; the mother\r\nreturned several times and partly destroyed the fence, which was then\r\nreplaced by a stronger one. One day, when the young had been hatched, the\r\nnest was found to be filled with sand, the shells and one dead little\r\ncrocodile being at the bottom of the hole. The mother had dug a deep ditch\r\nbelow the fence, but had not succeeded in reaching the nest, although she\r\nhad received and conducted her offspring away. As a rule, when the young\r\nare hatched, the sand and the shells are found to be scraped out of the\r\nnest. The mother is probably warned by the hiccough-like sound which the\r\nyoung emit while still within the unbroken shell. Voeltzkow heard them\r\npiping from the other end of his room, the eggs being covered with a layer\r\nof sand two feet high. The sounds were heard when he walked past the nest,\r\nor knocked against the box. Possibly the young hear the mother when she\r\nretires to the nest to sleep on it, and give her warning to remove the eggs\r\nout of the groove. However, they do not break the shell until several days\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nThe hatching is not caused by the rainy season, since it took place a\r\nfortnight before the first showers. The \"egg-tooth\" of the newly hatched\r\nyoung is 0.5 to 0.75 mm. high, bicuspid, and acts like a borer or auger. It\r\nis still visible on the tip of the upper jaw, in front of the nose, when\r\nthe creature is two weeks old. The {465}newly hatched crocodile is of an\r\nastonishing size, so that it is rather puzzling to understand how it was\r\nstowed away in the egg. For instance, an egg of 8 cm. length and 5 cm.\r\nwidth, sends forth a crocodile 28 cm. or 11 inches in length. Even at this\r\nearly age they snap at the finger.\r\n\r\nThe egg is covered by a hard shell, within which is a thicker outer and a\r\nthinner inner membrane. The \"white\" is jelly-like, sometimes of a greenish\r\ntinge, and is so consistent that it will not flow. The yolk is round, and\r\nso large that it nearly reaches the shell-membrane in the short diameter.\r\nThe yolk itself is surrounded by a very thin but strong membrane.\r\n\r\nThe embryo begins to develop long before the egg is laid. When laid the\r\ngerm is about 4 mm. long and shows about twelve somites. The cephalic bend\r\nbegins at the end of the second week, the tail grows longer and the embryo\r\nbecomes curled up. At the end of the third week it measures 10 mm. in a\r\nstraight line from brain to vent. The limbs begin to bud in the fourth\r\nweek. With the sixth week the final shape begins to reveal itself, and is\r\ncompleted at the age of eight weeks; but a third month is necessary to\r\nripen the embryo.\r\n\r\n_C. cataphractus_ is the Common Crocodile of West Africa, from the Senegal\r\nto the Congo. In opposition to _C. niloticus_ it does not enter brackish\r\nwater. It is easily recognised by the very slender snout, which rather\r\nresembles that of the Gavial; but the mandibular symphysis, although\r\nextending to the level of the eighth tooth, does not reach the splenial\r\nbones. The premaxillo-maxillary suture on the palate is not transverse, but\r\nextends backwards. In conformity with the length of the snout the\r\nmaxillaries meet in the dorso-medial line behind the nasal opening, thus\r\nexcluding the nasals from the latter. The nuchal scutes consist of two\r\nlarge pairs, almost in contact with the dorsals, six of which form the\r\nprincipal longitudinal rows. The gular and ventral scutes ossify in the\r\nadult, hence the specific name. The fingers and toes are slightly webbed.\r\nGeneral colour above, dark olive-brown; yellowish below. The young are\r\nolive with large black spots.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the Lower Congo catch the crocodiles with two pointed sticks\r\ntied together cross-wise, surrounded with entrails by way of a bait. The\r\nwhole is fastened to a pole or a strong rope and thrown into the river; and\r\na narrow line, with a float {466}attached to the cross-sticks, indicates\r\nthe whereabouts of the crocodile when it has taken the bait and has sunk to\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\n_C. johnstoni_, of Northern Australia and Northern Queensland, and _C.\r\nintermedius_, of the Orinoko, are allied to _C. cataphractus_, at least so\r\nfar as the configuration of the bones of the slender and long snout is\r\nconcerned. The former is small, scarcely reaching the length of 7 feet,\r\nwhile the South American species grows to 13 feet.\r\n\r\n_C. americanus_ s. _acutus_.–This species, which inhabits the West Indian\r\nIslands, being there the only representative of the order, occurs also in\r\nFlorida, and extends through the warmer parts of Central America into\r\nVenezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. Its characteristic feature is a median\r\nridge or swelling on the snout. The length and relative width of the latter\r\nvaries considerably. The maxillaries sometimes meet dorsally, or they\r\nremain separated by the narrow nasals, which in this case reach the\r\nposterior corner of the nasal groove. The nuchal scutes vary likewise;\r\nthere being often a smaller pair on the side of and another behind the four\r\nprincipal scutes, which, as usual, form a square. A transverse row of\r\nlittle suboccipital scutes is also common. Largest size about 12 feet long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.–Dorsal view of the skull of _Crocodilus\r\namericanus_. × ⅙. _F_, Frontal; _Jg_, jugal; _L_, lacrymal; _Mx_,\r\nmaxillary; _Na_, nasal; _P_, parietal; _Pmx_, premaxillary; _Prf_,\r\nprefrontal; _Ptf_, postfrontal; _Qj_, quadrato-jugal; _Sq_, squamosal; _T_,\r\ntooth-perforation.]\r\n\r\n_Osteolaemus tetraspis_ s. _frontatus_.–The only species of this genus\r\ninhabits the rivers of the west coast of Africa, from Sierra Leone to the\r\nOgowai. It differs from _Crocodilus_ chiefly by the bony septum of the\r\nnasal groove, produced by forward extension of the nasal bones. The snout\r\nis rather short and stout; the upper surface very rugose and deeply pitted,\r\nbut without ridges. The gular and ventral scutes are ossified, hence the\r\ngeneric name. Total length about 5 feet.\r\n\r\n_Alligator._–The fourth mandibular tooth fits into a pit in {467}the upper\r\njaw, and this pit is in some adult specimens transformed into a hole, the\r\ntip of the tooth appearing on the upper surface through the perforation.\r\nMost of the other teeth of the lower jaw are overlapped by those of the\r\nupper jaw. The number of teeth on either side amounts to seventeen to\r\ntwenty in the upper and eighteen to twenty in the lower jaw. The nasal\r\nbones form not only the posterior border of the nasal groove, but they\r\ndivide the latter by a median bony septum. The dorsal shield is formed by\r\nsix or eight longitudinal series of keeled bony scutes, which, although\r\nstanding close together, do not articulate with each other. Ossification of\r\nthe gular and ventral scutes is absent or very slight.\r\n\r\nAlligators occur in the fluviatile deposits of the age of the Upper Chalk\r\nin Europe, where they did not die out until the Pliocene age; they are now\r\nrestricted to two species, one in the Southern States of North America, the\r\nother in China.\r\n\r\n_A. mississippiensis._–The much-depressed and broadly rounded snout bears\r\nsome resemblance to that of a pike, hence the now discarded specific name\r\nof _lucius_. The neck is protected by two pairs of large scutes, which form\r\na square, interrupted in the middle line, with a pair of small scutes in\r\nfront and another behind. Of the eighteen transverse dorsal rows of scutes\r\neight are broad and prominent. The fingers are about half webbed, the outer\r\ntoes about two-thirds webbed. The general colour is greenish black or dark\r\nbrown above, yellowish below. Young specimens have yellowish cross-bands on\r\na darker brown ground.\r\n\r\nThe Alligator's northern limit is the mouth of the river Neuss in North\r\nCarolina, 35° N. lat. From this point they abound near the mouths of all\r\nthe creeks and rivers as far south as the Rio Grande, ascending the\r\nMississippi to the entrance of the Red River in 33° 50' N. lat.\r\n\r\nThe habits and the embryology of the American Alligator have been described\r\nby S. F. Clarke,[143] who gives the following vivid and minute account:–\r\n\r\n\"Usually one finds them in the waters of the smaller streams and ponds,\r\nlying with only the tip of the nose and the eyes exposed, or lying on an\r\nexposed place on the bank where the grass and other plants are beaten down,\r\nand the black, rich mud of the river bank is smoothed by the repeated\r\nmovements of the {468}alligators in climbing up and down. There they bask\r\nin the sunlight until disturbed by the hunter or the desire for food. When\r\naroused they make for the bottom, and I have never waited long enough to\r\nsee one return unless he were vigorously stimulated with a long pole. They\r\nfrequently dig a cave for themselves in the bottom of the pond or stream,\r\nor in the bank beneath the water. Oftentimes one can start them out of the\r\ncave by using a pole, but if very obstinate, the hunters dig them out with\r\nspades.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.–Skull of _Alligator mississippiensis_. A, Dorsal;\r\nB, ventral; C, lateral view. _Ag_, Angular bone of mandible; _Cd_,\r\noccipital condyle; _Ch_, choanae or posterior narial openings–the median\r\nsmall hole behind them indicates the position of the opening of the\r\nEustachian tubes; _Jg_, jugal; _L_, lacrymal; _Mx_, maxillary; _No_,\r\nnostrils; _Pa_, palatine; _Pm_, premaxillary; _Pt_, pterygoid; _Q_,\r\nquadrate; _T_, _Tr_, transverse bone or ectopterygoid.]\r\n\r\n\"As the water decreases in the streams and ponds with the summer heat, the\r\nalligators travel to the larger bodies of water. {469}During the breeding\r\nseason, from the end of May to the beginning of July, the males are very\r\nactive, wandering about to various ponds and rivers in search of the\r\nfemales. Fierce battles are said to take place during this time between the\r\nexcited males; and the mutilated specimens that one sees are weighty\r\nevidence for the truth of this assertion.... It is in the breeding season\r\nalso that their bellowing is mostly heard, and more in the night than\r\nduring the day. I have frequently heard them, while lying in the swamps at\r\nnight, when they were in ponds fully a mile distant.\r\n\r\n\"The largest specimen I saw measured 12 feet in length; and none of the\r\nmany hunters and other natives of Florida I have met have seen any longer\r\nthan 13 feet. All the hunters agree that it is only the males that acquire\r\nthe great size; no one had ever seen a female that measured over 8 feet,\r\nand the majority are not over seven.\r\n\r\n\"The male has a heavier, more powerful head, and during the breeding season\r\nespecially is more brilliantly coloured. The more brilliant colour occurs\r\nin patches and streaks on the sides of the head and body; it is generally a\r\nlight yellow, or even whitish, and on one large male I saw a fairly bright\r\nred spot over each eye.\r\n\r\n\"The alligators are rapidly diminishing in numbers under the stimulus of\r\nthe high prices offered to the hunters for their hides. Both Whites and\r\nIndians make increasing war upon them. Several thousand skins were brought\r\ninto the little station of Fort Pierce in 1890. The pioneers and settlers\r\nalways destroy the nests and eggs, because the alligators eat their pigs;\r\nand the cleaned eggs and young alligators are sold by hundreds in the curio\r\nshops farther north. As their numbers diminish in Florida it is noticed\r\nthat the Moccasin snakes increase. In Louisiana also the alligators are\r\ndisappearing; and there the musk-rats are at the same time increasing, and\r\nare doing much damage by burrowing in the levees along the Mississippi.\r\nWhile the alligator can make a very stout fight, I have never seen one\r\noffer fight if there was any chance of retreat. They never offered to\r\nmolest us, even when we waded through the ponds where they were.\r\n\r\n\"The nest of the alligator is very large, and is built by the female. A\r\ngreat quantity of dead leaves and twigs, together with {470}much of the\r\nfinely divided humus underlying them, is scraped together into a low mound\r\nabout 3 feet high; this varies considerably in its other dimensions, being\r\nin some instances 8 feet in diameter at the base. The nests are built on\r\nthe bank of a stream or pool, and the female digs a cave under water in the\r\nbank close to the nest. Careful examination, of the largest nest found\r\nshowed a root of a neighbouring palmetto-tree, nearly an inch in diameter,\r\nrunning through it at about a foot above the ground; there were also roots\r\nof a grape vine growing near, which extended nearly through the nest. This\r\nfurnishes strong support to the statement of many of the hunters, that the\r\nnests are used for more than one season. I could get no evidence whatever\r\nthat the nests are used more than once a year.\r\n\r\n\"The eggs are laid near the top of the nest, within 8 inches of the\r\nsurface, are four or five layers deep, and have no regular arrangement or\r\nuniform position of their axes in relation to the nest. The number of eggs\r\nto a nest varies from twenty to thirty, and averages twenty-eight; the\r\nmaximum found was forty-seven.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are white, elliptical, and vary in length from 50 to 90 mm. or 2\r\nto 3½ inches, and in the shorter diameter from 28 to 45 mm. Generally there\r\nis only slight variation in the eggs of one nest, but occasionally a nest\r\nis found in which most of the eggs are about the average size, while from\r\ntwo to five are very much smaller.\r\n\r\n\"The shell is much rougher than that of a hen's egg, and much thicker. The\r\nshell membrane consists of an outer and an inner layer, in both of which\r\nthe fibres are arranged spirally about the egg, but at right angles to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\"The white of the egg has the consistency of a very thick jelly, is very\r\nclear and transparent, and is so firm that the whole egg, when perfectly\r\nfresh, may be turned out of the shell and shell membrane, and transferred\r\nfrom one hand to the other without breaking, and with but slight change of\r\nform. The white lies mostly at either end of the shell, but extends also in\r\na thin layer between the yolk and the sides of the shell. The yolk holds a\r\nmedian position in the egg, is spherical, of a very light pale yellow, and\r\nso large that it almost touches the shell membrane about the midline.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Holbrook the young as soon as they are disengaged from the\r\nshell seek the water and shift for themselves, {471}the parents taking no\r\ncare of them, though they may remain for some weeks in the same locality.\r\nIn the spring and early summer months, and during the time of incubation,\r\nand especially on cloudy days or in the evening, alligators make a great\r\nnoise; their croak is not unlike that of the bullfrog, but louder and less\r\nprolonged. On the approach of winter they select holes in the ground, where\r\nthey remain torpid until spring. In this state of hibernation many are dug\r\nout by the negroes, who esteem the tail as an article of food.\r\n\r\n_A. sinensis_.–The first intimation of the existence of a Crocodilian in\r\nthe Yang-tse-kiang was made by Swinhoe in 1870, but it was not until nine\r\nyears later that Fauvel[144] described the creature as _A. sinensis_. The\r\nsame gentleman gave also an exhaustive account of the former records of\r\nthis species in Chinese literature. According to Boulenger its nearest ally\r\nis _A. mississippiensis_, but it approaches the Caimans by the presence of\r\nossifications in the ventral shields, which ossifications are, however,\r\nwide apart from each other. There are three pairs of large nuchal scutes in\r\ncontact in the median line, besides smaller scutes in front of the nuchals\r\nand behind the occiput. The dorsal shield contains six rows of larger\r\nscutes. The fingers are not webbed. The general colour is greenish black\r\nabove, speckled with yellow; greyish below. Total length only about six\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n_Caiman_.–The five species of this genus, confined to Central America or to\r\nthe East Andesian parts of South America, resemble the Alligators in most\r\nfeatures, but differ from them in the following points. The nasals,\r\nalthough bordering the nasal groove, do not form a bony nasal septum. The\r\nsupratemporal fossae are very small; or closed up, as in _C. trigonatus_\r\nand _C. palpebrosus_ of Guiana. The ventral armour is composed of\r\noverlapping bony scutes, each of which is formed of two parts united by a\r\nsuture.\r\n\r\n_C. sclerops_ has the widest distribution, from Southern Mexico to the\r\nnorthern half of Argentina. The upper eyelid is rugose, although only\r\nincompletely ossified, and is often more or less produced into a small\r\nhorn. _C. niger_ has flat upper eyelids.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bates, Caimans exist in myriads in the waters of the Upper\r\nAmazons. One species, _C. trigonatus_, the _Jacaré-tinga_ {472}of the\r\nnatives, reaches only six feet in length and has a slender muzzle and a\r\nblack-banded tail. Another species, _C. niger_, the _Jacaré-nassu_ or large\r\nCaiman, attains an enormous bulk and a length of 20 feet. They migrate\r\nannually, retreating to the flooded forests in the wet season and\r\ndescending to the main rivers in the dry season.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{473}CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPLESIOSAURIA–ICHTHYOSAURIA–PTEROSAURIA–PYTHONOMORPHA\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS VII.–PLESIOSAURIA._\r\n\r\n  _Mesozoic aquatic reptiles, with two pairs of pentadactyle limbs, firmly\r\n  fixed quadrate bones, single temporal arches, numerous alveolar teeth,\r\n  and ribs which articulate only with the centra of the biconcave\r\n  vertebrae._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Plesiosauria comprise the Mesosauri, Nothosauri, and Plesiosauri in an\r\nascending order of development, which concerns especially the changes from\r\na semi-terrestrial to an absolutely aquatic life;–elongation of the neck\r\nwith corresponding shortening of the tail, and the gradual transformation\r\nof the limbs into hyperphalangeal paddles.\r\n\r\nThe skull varies considerably in length. Seen from above it shows the\r\nnostrils, orbits, very large supratemporal foramina, and the interparietal\r\nhole. The nostrils lie rather far back, in front of the orbits, between the\r\nelongated premaxillaries, short nasals, and the usually large maxillaries.\r\nThe orbits are rather small, bordered behind by the postfrontals and\r\npostorbitals, which two bones fuse together in the Plesiosauri. The\r\ntemporal bridge is long, and is formed by the junction of the two bones\r\njust mentioned with the squamosal mass, which overlaps the greater portion\r\nof the quadrate, and perhaps contains the quadrato-jugal. The dorsal branch\r\nof the squamosal joins a corresponding diverging branch of the parietal,\r\nand completely shuts off the posterior region of the supratemporal foramen.\r\nThe interparietal hole is small and placed far back. The palate possesses a\r\nrow of teeth on the pterygoids in _Lariosaurus_. The choanae open\r\nseparately between the vomers and maxillaries. The pterygoids are very\r\nlong; posteriorly they join the quadrates, anteriorly they extend\r\n{474}right up to the vomers, separating the palatines from each other\r\nthereby. Palatal vacuities are absent in _Nothosaurus_; small and oval,\r\nbetween the palatines, pterygoids, ectopterygoids and maxillaries in\r\n_Lariosaurus_; still smaller in the Plesiosauri.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are mostly biconcave, in the Triassic genera still perforated\r\nby the chorda, while in many Plesiosauri the centra are solid, with almost\r\nplane articulating surfaces. The neural arches are usually firmly sutured,\r\nor quite fused with the centra. Intercentra are absent, except as chevrons\r\nin the tail. Although the cervical and some of the thoracic ribs of the\r\nTriassic genera have typical capitula and tubercula, they articulate\r\nexclusively upon the centra, and not upon the neural arches also. The\r\nnumber of cervical vertebrae amounts to nine in _Mesosaurus_; in\r\n_Lariosaurus_ it is increased to about twenty; and in some Plesiosauri to\r\nbetween thirty and forty. The cervical ribs are very short, but they\r\nincrease gradually towards the thorax, which is well protected by long and\r\nstrong ribs, which decrease again very gradually, being still long in the\r\nlumbar region. There is, properly speaking, no sacrum, because the one to\r\nfour sacral ribs remain quite separate. The tail is still long in\r\n_Lariosaurus_, consisting of about forty much shortened vertebrae;\r\nconsiderably shorter than the neck in most of the Plesiosauri. A sternum is\r\nabsent, but the belly is protected by many strong abdominal ribs, crowded\r\ntogether, and consisting each of a median and two pairs of lateral pieces.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder-girdle is very strong, composed of scapulae, very strong\r\ncoracoids, clavicles, and an interclavicle. The precoracoids are indicated\r\nby a process and a notch in the Triassic genera; in the later forms they\r\nare abolished. The coracoids always meet in the median line, and often\r\nproduce a strong symphysis. The scapulae possess a very prominent and large\r\nacromial process, upon which rest the dorsal or lateral ends of the\r\nclavicles. In some Plesiosauri the shoulder-girdle has undergone an\r\nabsolutely unique modification. The correct interpretation has been given\r\nby C. W. Andrews after the examination of exquisitely preserved specimens\r\nof _Cryptoclidus_ from the Oxford clay of the Middle Oolite, near\r\nPeterborough. The dorsal portion or main shaft of the scapula is reduced to\r\nwhat now looks like a dorso-lateral process, while the broad acromial\r\nprocess is much elongated, and lies in _Plesiosaurus_ upon the {475}ventral\r\nsurface of the clavicle; the latter and the irregularly T-shaped\r\ninterclavicle being, however, still visible from below. In _Cryptoclidus_\r\nthe two acromial processes meet each other and form a long ventral\r\nsymphysis, which meets that of the much-enlarged coracoids, the latter\r\nenclosing with the scapulae a pair of roundish foramina. The clavicles are\r\nnot visible from below; they rest upon the dorsal surface of the scapular\r\nsymphysis, and the interclavicle seems to be suppressed. Young\r\n_Cryptoclidus_ (Fig. 113, B) and various species of _Plesiosaurus_ show\r\nintermediate conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.–A, Restored outlines of a _Plesiosaurus_, × 1/50;\r\nB, dorsal view of the pectoral arch of an immature _Cryptoclidus_, from the\r\nmiddle Oolite; C, fore-limb of a _Plesiosaurus_, from the Lias. _A_,\r\nAcromial process of scapula; _Cl_, clavicle; _Co_, coracoid; _H_, humerus;\r\n_i_, carpale intermedium; _M_{1}_ to _m_{5}_ first to fifth metacarpals;\r\n_p_, pisiform bone; _R_, radius; _r_, radial carpal; _S_, scapula; _U_,\r\nulna; _u_, ulnar carpal.]\r\n\r\nThis unique arrangement is correlated with the enormous development of the\r\nfore-limbs, although nothing of the kind has taken place in the\r\nIchthyosauri, which have similar large paddles. The limbs exhibit\r\nconsiderable differences in the various groups of Plesiosauria, but they\r\nare all pentadactyle. In the oldest, the Mesosauri and Nothosauri, the\r\nlimbs are still of the terrestrial type, although fitted for swimming; the\r\nchief bones are still slender and elongated, and none of the five fingers\r\nand toes have more than five phalanges, the usual number of which seems to\r\nbe 2, 3, 4, 5, 3 for the first to fifth digits respectively. In the\r\nPlesiosauri the limbs are transformed into long hyperphalangeal paddles,\r\nunfit for progression on land, rather like those of the Ichthyosauria, with\r\nmuch {476}shortened radius and ulna, tibia and fibula; but the phalanges,\r\nwhich increase to about ten, are always longer than broad, and there is no\r\nindication of an increase of the number of fingers, or of additional,\r\nlateral, phalanx-like nodules. The pelvis is very strong; the broad pubes\r\nand ischia meet in the middle line, and they either enclose one wide\r\nundivided foramen, or the two symphysial portions meet, and there are then\r\ntwo obturator-foramina. The pubes are generally much larger, especially\r\nbroader, than the ischia; and although partaking in the formation of the\r\nacetabulum, they do not articulate with the ilia, at least not in\r\nPlesiosauri. The ilia are always small; in Plesiosauri attached to only one\r\nor two sacral ribs; to three or four in the Triassic genera.\r\n\r\nIchthyosauri and Plesiosauri were combined as \"Enaliosauria\" by Conybeare.\r\nOwen recognised their fundamental differences, and separated them as\r\n\"Ichthyopterygia\" and \"Sauropterygia,\" according to the structure of the\r\nlimbs. We now know that the paddles of the Ichthyosauri bear but a\r\nsuperficial resemblance to the fins of fishes, and are fundamentally\r\nreferable to the pentadactyle type, as are the paddles of the Plesiosauri,\r\nalthough the latter retain more of the typical features of reptilian limbs.\r\nIt was soon recognised that the Nothosauri are allied to the Plesiosauri,\r\nbut the Mesosauri (until then vaguely grouped with the Rhynchocephalia, or\r\nlinked with Protorosauri as Proganosauria) have only recently[145] received\r\ntheir proper place in the system as members of the Plesiosauria, which we\r\ndivide into two main groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. NOTHOSAURI.[146]\r\n\r\nThe limbs are of the terrestrial type; the five digits have the usual\r\nnumber of phalanges, which do not exceed five. The bones of the limbs are\r\nslender; the humerus has an entepicondylar foramen.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. MESOSAURIDAE.–The neck contains about ten vertebrae. The vertebrae\r\nare deeply biconcave, perforated by the chorda dorsalis. Sacral vertebrae\r\nfour in number. Clavicles strong; interclavicle very small. _Mesosaurus_,\r\nthe only genus, with one species, _M. tenuidens_, about one foot in length,\r\nwas found in {477}South Africa, probably in Triassic sandstone. Very\r\nsimilar specimens are known from São Paolo in Brazil.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. NOTHOSAURIDAE.–With sixteen to twenty-one cervical and three to\r\nfive sacral vertebrae. The vertebrae are biconcave. The clavicles are\r\nstrong; the interclavicle is much reduced. Coracoids with distinct acromial\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n_Nothosaurus mirabilis_, of the Muschelkalk of Germany. Total length about\r\nten feet. Length of head about one foot. The teeth are very irregular.\r\nAbout five slender, long teeth are implanted in each side of the\r\npremaxilla, with wide spaces between them, similar to those of the\r\nsymphysial portion of the lower jaw. Those of the maxillaries are numerous\r\nand small, except two large pairs in the anterior portion, on a level\r\nbetween the orbits and nostrils. The upper and lower teeth overlap, or\r\ncross each other. The palate of the long and slender skull is quite bony,\r\nwithout anterior palatal or infra-orbital vacuities.\r\n\r\n_Lariosaurus balsami_, about one foot in length, from the fresh-water\r\ndeposits of the Upper Trias in Lombardy. Neck with about twenty, tail with\r\nabout forty vertebrae. Head comparatively shorter; more triangular than in\r\n_Nothosaurus_; palate with small infra-orbital vacuities. The number of the\r\nphalanges of the fingers and toes is apparently 2, 3, 4, 4, 3 and 2, 3, 4,\r\n5, 4.\r\n\r\n_Anarosaurus pumilio_, of the Muschelkalk, near Magdeburg, and\r\n_Neusticosaurus_ and _Simosaurus_ of the same geological age, are allied\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. PLESIOSAURI.\r\n\r\nThe limbs are transformed into hyperphalangeal paddles. The clavicles are\r\nsmall, and are overlapped ventrally by the strongly developed acromial\r\nprocesses of the scapulae. The vertebrae are slightly biconcave or plane.\r\nThe neck consists of at least twenty vertebrae; those of the thoracic\r\nregion have long transverse processes; the sacral vertebrae are mostly\r\nreduced to two or one. Very large, massive animals.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. PLIOSAURIDAE.–About twenty cervical vertebrae, with proximally\r\nbifurcated ribs. The scapulae do not meet ventrally; they enclose with the\r\ncoracoids a single large foramen, and are fused with the clavicles.\r\n_Pliosaurus_, the principal genus, contains several species of gigantic\r\nsize; for instance, _P. grandis_, of the Kimmeridge clay, Upper Oolite, of\r\nEngland, has a skull {478}nearly 5 feet long and 2 feet broad, armed with\r\nmany enormous conical teeth, some of which reach one foot in length,\r\ninclusive of the long collar and root-portion. The neck is rather short,\r\nowing to the much condensed, disc-shaped centra of the vertebrae. Total\r\nlength of this species about 30 feet. Other species in England and\r\ncontinental Europe as far as Russia.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. PLESIOSAURIDAE.–The neck is very long, and consists of from\r\ntwenty-eight to forty vertebrae. The scapulae do not meet ventrally, but\r\nthe symphysial portion of the coracoids meets the clavicles and the\r\ninterclavicle, the pectoral arch thus enclosing two foramina. Chief genus\r\n_Plesiosaurus_, with many species. The head is comparatively small, the\r\nneck very long, the tail short, although consisting of from thirty to forty\r\nvertebrae. The third digit (Fig. 113, C) is the longest, and possesses nine\r\nor ten phalanges. The abdominal ribs are very strong, and reach from the\r\npectoral to the pelvic girdle. Range from the Lower Trias to the Lower\r\nOolite, chiefly European. _P. dolichodirus_ and _P. conybeari_, the latter\r\nreaching a total length of more than 15 feet, from the Lower Lias,\r\nespecially at Lyme Regis.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. ELASMOSAURIDAE.–The neck is extremely long, possessing from\r\nthirty-five to seventy-two vertebrae, with single-headed, not bifurcated,\r\nribs. The scapulae meet ventrally, and enclose with the very broad\r\ncoracoids two foramina. The tail is short. The pisiform bone articulates\r\nwith the humerus. Otherwise much resembling the Plesiosauridae. Principal\r\ngenus _Cimoliasaurus_, with many synonyms, and many species from the Middle\r\nOolite to the Upper Chalk; cosmopolitan distribution, e.g. _C.\r\ncantabrigiensis_, of the Greensand and Upper Chalk; _C. trochantericus_, of\r\nthe Kimmeridge clay; _C. haasti_ in New Zealand; _C. australis_, _C.\r\nchilensis_; others in North America. _Cryptoclidus_ of the Middle and Upper\r\nOolite of Europe. _Elasmosaurus_, of the Upper Cretaceous formation in\r\nKansas, with a computed total length of 45 feet, of which 22 belong to the\r\nneck, with its seventy-two vertebrae.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS VIII.–ICHTHYOSAURIA._\r\n\r\n  _Marine, whale-shaped reptiles, with the anterior and posterior limbs\r\n  transformed into hyperphalangeal paddles. Restricted to the Mesozoic age\r\n  from the Trias to the Upper Chalk._\r\n\r\nThe skull is long, owing to the elongated slender snout, which {479}is\r\nformed mainly by the premaxillary bones. The nostrils lie far back, in\r\nfront of the orbits, and are bordered by the long nasals, the\r\npremaxillaries, a small part of the maxillaries, and posteriorly by the\r\nlarge lacrymal bones. The eyes are large, and are strengthened by a\r\nsclerotic ring composed of many closely overlapping bones. The orbits are\r\nvery large, and are directed sideways so as to be scarcely visible from\r\nabove. They are formed above by the long prefrontals, which join the\r\npostfrontals; behind by the long postorbitals; below by the long and\r\nslender jugals; in front by the lacrymals and prefrontals. The\r\npostorbito-temporal region of the skull is short but high, and, with the\r\nexception of the supratemporal foramen, is entirely closed in by bones,\r\nnamely, the quadrato-jugals, supratemporals, and squamosals. The latter,\r\nwith the parietals and large postfrontals, surround the supratemporal\r\nforamina. The parietals and the small frontals enclose the parietal\r\nforamen. The whole temporal arch consequently recalls much that of the\r\nPareiasauri and Stegocephali, chiefly owing to the presence of conspicuous\r\nsupratemporal and postorbital bones, which, together with the\r\nquadrato-jugal, close in the whole side without any indication of a lateral\r\nor infratemporal foramen. The postorbital completely separates the jugal\r\nfrom the quadrato-jugal, and this almost hides the quadrate. The occipital\r\ncondyle is single. The lateral occipitals and the supra-occipital bones\r\nretain their sutures. The pro-otic and opisthotic bones remain separate.\r\nThe latter lie between the basi- and lateral occipitals, the squamosal,\r\nquadrate, and pterygoid. The pterygoids, which posteriorly touch the\r\nquadrato-jugals, basi-occipitals, opisthotics, and basisphenoid, are very\r\nlong and remain widely separated from each other; in the space between them\r\nappears the long ensiform presphenoid. Anteriorly they are connected\r\nthrough the ectopterygoids with the maxillae, and touch the palatines.\r\nThese are likewise narrow and slender, but touch each other in the middle\r\nline, and contain the well-separated, slit-like choanae, laterally to which\r\nlie the elongated, rather narrow, palatal vacuities. The vomers are mostly\r\nnot visible; when they appear on the surface they are long and narrow, and\r\nenclose the choanae between them and the palatines.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are pointed, conical and thickly covered with enamel, which in\r\ntransverse sections forms vertical ridges, recalling {480}the folds of the\r\nLabyrinthodonts. The teeth have open roots, and are not implanted in\r\nseparate alveoli, but lie in long grooves of the premaxillaries,\r\nmaxillaries, and dentals.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are numerous, up to 150, two-thirds of which belong to the\r\ntail. The centra are deeply biconcave and short, not co-ossified with the\r\nneural arches, which have therefore often broken loose. The atlas much\r\nresembles the other cervical vertebrae in so far as its centrum is concave\r\nin front and scarcely ankylosed with that of the second. Its basiventrals,\r\nequivalent to the ventral half of the atlas-ring of other reptiles, thus\r\nbecome an unpaired intercentral wedge, between the first centrum and the\r\nbasis of the cranium; the neural arches rest upon the centrum, but remain\r\nseparate from each other, or at least diverge dorsally. The atlas carries\r\nno ribs. Intercentra occur also between the second and third vertebrae;\r\nthey reappear in the tail as chevron-bones. All the other vertebrae carry\r\nribs, which gradually increase in length towards the trunk and decrease\r\nagain equally gradually on the tail. In the neck and trunk they have\r\nseparate capitula and tubercula, which articulate upon short knobs of the\r\ncentra; towards the tail these shift farther and farther towards the\r\nventral side, and ultimately unite. Although the ribs of the trunk are so\r\nlong, there is no trace of a sternum, but there are many \"abdominal ribs\"\r\ncrowded together, each consisting of a middle and a pair of lateral pieces.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder-girdle is very complete, but the pieces remain separate, or at\r\nleast do not co-ossify; it consists of a T-shaped interclavicle, clavicles,\r\nbroad coracoids touching each other in the middle line, and short scapulae.\r\nThe existence of small separate precoracoids is doubtful. The pelvis is\r\nmuch reduced; the small ilium is quite unconnected with any vertebrae; the\r\nsmall pubes and ischia form no symphyses. The fore- and hind-limbs are very\r\nsimilar to each other; the posterior are, however, much smaller. Both are\r\ntransformed into highly specialised paddles. It is of the greatest\r\nimportance, as an indication that the Ichthyosauri are descendants of a\r\nterrestrial stock, and have been modified into what they are owing to\r\nhaving taken to marine life, that in the oldest members known, the\r\npaddle-like structure of the limbs was less advanced than in the later\r\nspecies. In _Mixosaurus_ of the Muschelkalk of Europe the ulna and radius\r\nare still distinctly longer than broad, and they enclose a space\r\n{481}between them. They articulate with three carpal bones, the ulnare,\r\nintermedium, and radiale, while a small pisiform bone lies on the outer\r\nside, between the ulnare and the outer distal carpal bone. In\r\n_Ichthyosaurus_, from the Liassic period onwards, the ulna and radius are\r\nmuch shortened, broader than long, and touch each other without any\r\nintervening space; the pisiform element is enlarged. Lastly, in\r\n_Ophthalmosaurus_ of the Middle Oolite (but not in contemporary species of\r\n_Ichthyosaurus_) the ulna and radius are still more reduced, and the\r\npisiform has moved up to the humerus, so that the latter articulates with\r\nthree bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.–A, Ventral view of the shoulder-girdle and right\r\nfore-limb of an _Ichthyosaurus_, from the Lias; B, part of the fore-limb of\r\na _Mixosaurus_, from the Trias; C, part of the fore-limb of an\r\n_Ophthalmosaurus_, from the Chalk. _c_{1}_, _c_{2}_, first and second\r\ncentrale carpi; _Cl_, clavicle; _Co_, coracoid; _H_, humerus; _I_,\r\ninterclavicle; _i_, intermedium carpi; _p_, pisiform; _R_, radius; _r_,\r\nradial carpal; _Sc_, scapula; _U_, ulna; _u_, ulnar carpal.]\r\n\r\nOther important features of these paddles are not only the much-increased\r\nnumber of phalanges (sometimes up to twenty or more), but also the increase\r\nof digits to six or more, produced apparently by a splitting of the third\r\nfinger into two series, and by the development of additional rows of\r\nphalanx-like bones on the outer and inner margins of the paddle. This\r\nincrease of fingers exists, for instance, in _Ichthyosaurus communis_, but\r\nnot in _I. tenuirostris_. Owing to this peculiar development of paddles the\r\nconstituent bones are extremely numerous, and from the radius and ulna\r\ndownwards they are all closely packed, and have assumed a polygonal, often\r\nhexagonal, shape, dwindling to more or {482}less flattened nodules towards\r\nthe ends of the digits. These carpal and phalangeal bones are common\r\nobjects in amateurs' collections; they fit together by the short angular\r\nfacets, while the two flat and broader surfaces are those of the dorsal and\r\nventral sides.\r\n\r\nThe Ichthyosaurs lived upon fishes and cuttlefish, as is indicated by their\r\ndentition and the shape of the snout, and proved by the coprolites, most of\r\nwhich are full of fragments of bones and ganoid scales of fishes, and of\r\nthe beaks and shells of cuttlefish; the larger of these true coprolites\r\n(literally \"petrified dung\"), in coprolite-beds, contain also an abundance\r\nof other fossils, such as Ammonites, Terebratulae, molluscs and\r\nfish-remains; they are several inches long, and many of them show on the\r\noutside ring-like impressions, undoubtedly caused by a spiral valve of the\r\nintestinal canal. In conformity with their absolutely aquatic life the\r\nIchthyosaurs were viviparous. Several well-preserved adult specimens have\r\nbeen found, which contain the skeletons of one or more rather large young\r\nwithin the body, in exactly the position in which such foetal creatures\r\nwould lie, namely, with the head in the pelvic region of the mother, while\r\nthe rest of the body stretches along the vertebral column towards the\r\nchest. The suggestion that these young Ichthyosaurs have been swallowed by\r\ntheir cannibal elders is too idle to require serious refutation.\r\n\r\nUntil within a few years Ichthyosaurs were always restored with a smooth\r\nand even back, but several well-preserved specimens have come to light in\r\nWürtemberg which show the complete contour of the animals, with a long,\r\nsomewhat jagged fin on the middle of the back. Since then not a few\r\nspecimens in various collections have on closer examination revealed the\r\nsame feature, except, of course, those in which the outlines of the fin had\r\nbeen chiselled away in order to \"improve\" the look of the slab. The fins\r\nwere undoubtedly of the \"adipose\" kind;–raised folds of the skin. The\r\nlatter is now known to have been covered, at least at the bases of the\r\ndorsal fins, with hard little scales, probably osteoderms.\r\n\r\nMany specimens are beautifully preserved, others present a very peculiar\r\nappearance. They look, namely, like long rolls of clay, and nobody but an\r\nexpert would suspect an _Ichthyosaurus_ within such a log. The explanation\r\nis simple. The dead {483}creature was rolled about by the waves of the surf\r\non the Liassic muddy beach until it was wrapped in a mantle of clay and\r\nthen imbedded on the shore.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of Ichthyosaurs in time and space is wide. The earliest\r\nare found in the Middle Trias; in the Lias they are very common, fairly\r\nfrequent in the Oolites, dying out with the Cretaceous epoch. They have\r\nleft no descendants, being far too specialised, and their origin is quite\r\nunknown. _Mixosaurus_, the oldest genus, occurred in Europe, and has also\r\nbeen found in the Triassic strata of Spitsbergen. _Ichthyosaurus_, the\r\nchief genus, is known from the Liassic, Oolite, and Cretaceous strata of\r\nEurope, a famous place being Lyme Regis; and also from the Cretaceous\r\nstrata of Queensland and New Zealand.  The Jurassic of Wyoming has yielded\r\n_Baptanodon_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.–Restored outlines of _Ichthyosaurus\r\nquadriscissus_. (After Fraas.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER ICHTHYOSAURI.\r\n\r\nThe few genera are easily recognised.\r\n\r\n_Mixosaurus_, Triassic, with radius and ulna still elongated, a\r\nlongitudinal space occurring between them. Both jaws with numerous uniform\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n_Ichthyosaurus_, with much shortened radius and ulna; both jaws with\r\nuniform series of teeth. Many species are known, some with four to five,\r\nothers with several additional and incomplete rows of fingers and toes. _I.\r\ntrigonodon_ of the Lias in Würtemberg seems to have reached the size of 30\r\nfeet, the vertebrae showing a diameter of 9 inches, while the skull is 6\r\nfeet long. _I. communis_ and _I. tenuirostris_ are common in the English\r\nLias. The long-snouted _I. campylodon_, with large, spaced teeth, occurs in\r\nthe Gault of Cambridge, Dover, and France; and {484}there are many others.\r\n_Ophthalmosaurus_, of the Upper Oolitic and Cretaceous formations of\r\nEngland, had very small vestigial teeth.\r\n\r\n_Baptanodon_, of the Upper Jurassic epoch of Wyoming, was toothless, and\r\nwas one of the six-toed forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS IX.–PTEROSAURIA._\r\n\r\n  _Mesozoic reptiles with fixed quadrate bones and with the anterior limbs\r\n  transformed into wings, the enormously elongated ulnar finger carrying a\r\n  patagium._\r\n\r\nThe skull bears a superficial resemblance to that of Birds. It articulates\r\nwith the neck by a single condyle, at nearly a right angle. The\r\ninterparietal foramen is absent, but there are five pairs of foramina on\r\nthe surface of the skull, namely, the nostrils, orbits, supra- and\r\ninfra-temporal and pre-orbital foramina. Most of the constituent bones of\r\nthe cranium fuse with each other, and the composition of the various arches\r\nis therefore difficult to make out with certainty. The premaxillaries are\r\nfused together, and extend dorsally backwards between the nasals, which\r\nthemselves diverge towards the prefrontals. The nostrils are bordered\r\nchiefly by the maxillaries, nasals, and prefrontals. The orbits are very\r\nlarge, mostly shut off in front from the pre-orbital foramina by a bridge,\r\nwhich is formed by descending processes of the prefrontals and ascending\r\nprocesses of the jugal. Above and behind, the orbits are bordered by the\r\nfrontals, postfrontals, and possibly the quadrato-jugals. The whole\r\ntemporal region is shortened from before backwards, but heightened\r\ndorso-ventrally, and the whole temporal fossa is divided into a supra- and\r\ninfra-temporal portion by the junction of the postfrontal with the\r\nsquamosal, the latter joining the parietal, thus closing the supratemporal\r\nfossa behind. This is conspicuous only in the older forms, e.g.\r\n_Dimorphodon_, but is very small in _Pterodactylus_, and quite abolished in\r\n_Pteranodon_. The infratemporal fossa is a narrow slit, slanting obliquely\r\nupwards and backwards, between the quadrate and the quadrato-jugal. A\r\nforamen of this kind occurs elsewhere only in the Rhynchocephalia. The\r\nquadrate is long, firmly fixed, and slants so far forwards that the\r\nmandibular joint lies on a level below the middle of the orbit. The\r\npterygoids articulate with strong and long processes of the basisphenoid,\r\ntouch the quadrate posteriorly, enclose an interpterygoid vacuity, {485}and\r\nextend forwards as slender bones to the vomer, separating the palatines.\r\nThe choanae are enclosed by the vomer, palatines, and maxillaries, and they\r\nlie in dorsal recesses above the level of the roof of the mouth. The teeth\r\nare alveolar, pointed, of variable size, and restricted to the jaws; in the\r\nPteranodonts they are absent.\r\n\r\nThe brain is known from the natural cast of _Scaphognathus_, and shows some\r\nremarkably bird-like features, especially the width of the hemispheres,\r\nwhich touch the well-developed cerebellum, while the optic lobes lie on the\r\nsides of the cerebellum, with a pair of appendices, the so-called flocculi,\r\nelsewhere known in birds only.\r\n\r\nThe caudal vertebrae are still amphicoelous, while the presacral vertebrae\r\nare procoelous. Abdominal ribs are few in number and are very thin. The\r\ntrue ribs possess capitula and tubercula; those of the neck are very short\r\nand directed backwards; in the thoracic region they are long, and some are\r\nattached to a broad sternum with a keel and a median anterior process, on\r\nthe sides of which latter articulate the coracoids. Precoracoids and\r\nclavicles are absent. The scapulae are long, sabre-shaped, and turned back\r\nas in birds; in _Pteranodon_ they show the unique modification of\r\narticulating with special processes of the neural arches of several\r\nankylosed thoracic vertebrae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.–_Pterodactylus crassirostris._ × ⅓. (From\r\nGeikie.)]\r\n\r\nThe hand possesses only four fingers; the four phalanges of the ulnar\r\nfinger are very much elongated for the support of the patagium; the other\r\nfingers remain short and are provided with little claws. The ilia are\r\nexpanded horizontally, and are firmly attached to from three to six\r\nvertebrae, which mostly fuse together into a sacrum. The ventral half of\r\nthe pelvis consists of a pair of broad bones, which contain a small\r\nobturator-foramen; they form a ventral symphysis, and are usually fused\r\nwith the ilium. These bones represent the conjoint ischia and pubes, while\r\nthe so-called pubes, a pair of flat and club-shaped bones, are excluded\r\n{486}from the acetabulum. The whole arrangement resembles that of the\r\nCrocodilian pelvis. The hind-limbs are bird-like in so far as the fibulae\r\nare reduced to splints, and attached to the proximal halves of the long and\r\nslender tibiae. The feet contain five separate toes with rather long\r\nmetatarsals and short claws. Many of the bones are hollow.\r\n\r\nThe Pterosauria have no relationship with the birds, in spite of the number\r\nof apparently striking resemblances (_e.g._ choanae, pre-orbital foramina,\r\nbrain, scapula, fibula, cervical vertebrae), which are, however,\r\ncoincidences, cases of convergence, in conformity with the aerial life. The\r\ntotally different plan of the wings is sufficient to show this. On the\r\nother hand, the real affinities of this group of flying reptiles are\r\nunknown. They turn up \"fully fledged\" in the Lower Lias, and they reach\r\ntheir highest specialisation in the Upper Cretaceous epoch, with which they\r\nhave died out. In fact we do not know any forms through which to connect\r\nthem with other extinct reptiles. The skull shows some Rhynchocephalian\r\nfeatures; the pelvis, Crocodilian features; and this combination points\r\nback a long way.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER PTEROSAURI.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 1. PTERODACTYLI, with alveolar teeth in the upper and lower jaws.\r\nImperfect remains, impressions of phalanges of the long patagial finger,\r\nare known from the Rhaetic of Würtemberg. The oldest well-known genus is\r\n_Dimorphodon_, Lower Lias of Lyme Regis. _D. macronyx._–Total length\r\nbetween 3 and 4 feet, of which the large light skull takes up about 9\r\ninches, and the long thin tail about 2 feet. The patagial finger is about\r\n20 inches, the whole wing about 28 inches long. _Rhamphorhynchus\r\nlongicaudatus_ of the Upper Oolite of Germany is remarkable for the long\r\nslender teeth, which are directed forwards and separated by wide spaces\r\nfrom each other. The nine or ten cervical vertebrae are elongated. _R.\r\nphyllurus_ of the same geological age has left impressions of the flying\r\nmembranes. They extend from the whole length of the wing and the sides of\r\nthe trunk to the thigh as far as the knee, and from the inside of the\r\nhind-limbs to the tail. The end of the tail carries a spatulate membrane.\r\nAllied is _Ornithocheirus_, with many species in the English Wealden and\r\nGreensand. {487}_Pterodactylus_, with many species from the Upper Oolite,\r\nchiefly of Germany.–The tail is very short, consisting of a few vertebrae\r\nonly. The seven neck-vertebrae are so much elongated that the neck is as\r\nlong as the trunk with the tail. _P. longirostris_ measures about 1 foot in\r\ntotal length, while _P. spectabilis_ is one of the smallest, only of the\r\nsize of a lark. The wings, however, measure 10 inches from tip to tip. The\r\nlargest is _P. giganteus_, with a \"spread\" of more than 5 feet.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 2. PTERANODONTES.–The beak is long, pointed, toothless, and\r\nlaterally compressed; mandibular symphysis very long. _Pteranodon\r\nlongiceps._–The skull has a long parieto-supraoccipital crest, which\r\nextends far back. The supratemporal foramina are abolished. The pre-orbital\r\nand orbital foramina are confluent. The scapulae are attached to several\r\nthoracic vertebrae. The skull of this gigantic species has a length of two\r\nfeet and a half, and the spread of the wings measures nearly 20 feet. This,\r\nand several much smaller species, are from the Middle Cretaceous formation\r\nof Kansas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.–_Rhamphorhynchus muensteri_, × ⅐, as restored by\r\nMarsh. (From Geikie.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS X.–PYTHONOMORPHA._\r\n\r\n  _Very long-necked and long-bodied marine Cretaceous reptiles, with\r\n  movable quadrates, single lateral temporal arches and procoelous\r\n  vertebrae; with paddle-shaped, pentadactyle limbs; and with the teeth\r\n  ankylosed to the jaws._\r\n\r\nThe skull possesses many of the essential features of the typical lizards.\r\nThe premaxillaries, frontals, and parietals are fused into unpaired bones.\r\nThere is an interparietal foramen. {488}The nostrils are dorsal, bordered\r\nby the premaxillae, nasals, prefrontals, and maxillaries. The\r\nquadrato-jugal arch is incomplete, and the orbit is posteriorly confluent\r\nwith the infratemporal fossa, but a supratemporal space is shut off by the\r\nsingle arch, which is composed of the postfrontal, squamosal, and\r\nsupratemporal. The latter is interposed between, and connects the squamosal\r\nand quadrate with the latero-posterior branch of the parietal. There is a\r\nspace between this parieto-squamosal arcade and the epi-otic, which is\r\nfused with the lateral wing of the lateral occipital bone. The foramen\r\nmagnum is bordered by the two supra-occipital, lateral occipital, and the\r\nunpaired basioccipital bones; the condyle is triple. The quadrate is\r\nmovable, articulating with the squamosal and laterally expanded epi-otic.\r\nThere is no bony connexion of the quadrate with the jugal, which is\r\nrestricted to its anterior half, and attached to the maxillary and\r\nlacrymal. The quadrato-jugal is absent as a separate bone; it is probably\r\nfused with the anterior surface of the quadrate, as indicated by a\r\nperforation of the quadrate, resembling in this respect the\r\nRhynchocephalia. The vomers are long, and separate the elongated choanae\r\nfrom each other. The palatines separate the vomers from the pterygoids,\r\nwhich enclose a long median vacuity and are not connected with the\r\nquadrates. The teeth are conical, and stand near the inner margin of the\r\njaws upon little prominences, with which they fuse. Some genera have teeth\r\nupon the pterygoids also.\r\n\r\nThe vertebrae are very numerous and are mostly procoelous. They are\r\nnoteworthy for the possession of an additional anterior and a posterior\r\npair of articulating processes on the neural arches, homologous with the\r\nzygosphenes and zygantra of Snakes and Iguanidae (see p. 582). Intercentra\r\nare absent, except in the tail. The ribs have no tubercula, and articulate\r\nwith the centra of the vertebrae to which they belong.\r\n\r\nThe pectoral arch is strong. The scapulae are short and broad; the\r\ncoracoids, fused with the precoracoids, except for a notch, are flat and\r\nbroad, and meet ventrally; posteriorly they articulate upon the anterior\r\nmargin of the flat sternum, to the lateral margin of which are attached\r\nseveral ribs. Clavicles and interclavicle seem to be absent. Abdominal ribs\r\nare likewise absent. The pelvic girdle is feeble; the ilia, ischia, and\r\npubes are loosely connected with each other, the pairs of ventral elements\r\n{489}meeting also in the middle line. The ilia are loosely attached to two\r\nvertebrae in the Dolichosauri; in the Mosasauri they have lost this\r\nconnexion. Both anterior and posterior limbs are transformed into\r\npentadactyle paddles, with much shortened and broadened bones of the arms\r\nand legs. The digits are to a certain extent hyperphalangeal, since several\r\nof them possess five phalanges.\r\n\r\nThe Pythonomorpha are undoubtedly allied to the Sauria, but they are\r\ncertainly not their ancestors, since typical Autosauri occur in the Lower\r\nChalk; nor are the Snakes their descendants, in spite of many convergent\r\nresemblances. We consider them to be the marine collateral branch of the\r\nSauria, which rapidly developed highly specialised, often very large forms,\r\nrestricted to the Cretaceous epoch, with a wide, cosmopolitan distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. DOLICHOSAURI.\r\n\r\nThis older group is characterised by the sutural symphysial connexion of\r\nthe two mandibles and by the possession of two sacral vertebrae. The body\r\nis snake-like. Pleurodont. _Dolichosaurus longicollis_ of the Lower Chalk\r\nof Kent and Sussex; total length about 3 feet, with about seventeen\r\ncervical vertebrae and pleurodont teeth. _Acteosaurus_ of Istria; anterior\r\nextremities distinctly shorter than the posterior pair; tail long.\r\nVertebrae, like those of _Dolichosaurus_, with zygosphenes.\r\n_Plioplatecarpus_ of the Upper Chalk of Holland has a slender\r\ninterclavicle; the vertebrae are without zygosphenes, but those of the\r\ncervical region possess a downwardly directed long hypapophysial process\r\nwith a separately ossified epiphysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. MOSASAURI.\r\n\r\nThe two halves of the lower jaw are connected by ligament and are therefore\r\nmovable as in Snakes. There are no sacral vertebrae, the pelvis having lost\r\nits connexion with the vertebral column. The formation of the limbs into\r\npaddles is more pronounced than in the Dolichosauri.\r\n\r\n_Mosasaurus_, the chief genus, so called from Mosa, the Latin name of the\r\nriver Maas, with several species from the Upper Cretaceous strata of the\r\nNetherlands, England, and North {490}America. _M. camperi_, from Belgium,\r\nwith a skull about 4 feet in length, armed with many large, curved,\r\nacrodont teeth. The vertebral column consists of about one hundred caudal\r\nand thirty-four precaudal vertebrae, of which seven are cervical, without\r\nzygosphenes. The total length of the type-specimen is estimated at 25 feet.\r\n\r\n_Platecarpus_ of North America and New Zealand, and various other North\r\nAmerican genera, also contained species of large size.\r\n\r\n_Liodon._–Premaxilla without teeth, the others nearly smooth instead of\r\nbeing ridged. With a very wide distribution in the Chalk of Europe, North\r\nAmerica, and New Zealand. _L. haumuriensis_ of New Zealand seems to have\r\nbeen the giant amongst these monstrous marine creatures; its total length\r\nhas been computed from imperfect fragments at 100 feet.\r\n\r\n_Clidastes_, of the Upper Cretaceous of North America and Europe, although\r\nnot so massive, comprises the most elongated forms. The cervical vertebrae\r\npossess long median hypapophyses with separate epiphyses; most of the\r\nvertebrae are much elongated and have well-developed zygosphenes. _C.\r\ntortor_ had a skull nearly two feet and a half long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{491}CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nSAURIA–AUTOSAURI OR LACERTILIA–LIZARDS\r\n\r\n\r\n_SUB-CLASS XI.–SAURIA._\r\n\r\n  _Reptiles with movable quadrate bones, with a transverse, external,\r\n  cloacal opening, near the posterior lateral corners of which open the\r\n  eversible, paired (right and left) copulatory organs._\r\n\r\nThe Sauria, which comprise the AUTOSAURI or Lacertilia in the wider sense\r\nand the OPHIDIA or Snakes, are the most recently developed groups of\r\nReptiles. No fossils are known from strata earlier than those of the\r\nCretaceous epoch. Their origin has probably to be looked for among the\r\nProsauria, of which _Sphenodon_, cf. p. 294, is the only surviving member.\r\nThe Sauria have attained their great development within the Tertiary\r\nperiod. They, both Autosauri and Ophidia, are now the two dominant\r\nReptilian groups, and they have, so to speak, a future before them, being\r\napparently still on the increase in numbers and species, but certainly not\r\nin size.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. AUTOSAURI OR LACERTILIA–_LIZARDS_.\r\n\r\n_Saurians which have the right and left halves of the mandibles connected\r\nby a sutural symphysis._\r\n\r\nThe overwhelming majority possess well-developed limbs, movable eyelids and\r\ncutaneous scales, covered by the mostly thin and horny epidermis. But there\r\nare many kinds of Autosauri, especially those belonging to the degraded,\r\nburrowing families, which have lost not only one or both pairs of limbs,\r\nbut even the limb-girdles, while the eyes have become concealed beneath the\r\nskin, and in some cases the scales have been lost, or reduced {492}to mere\r\nvestiges. Moreover in some of these burrowing and limbless forms the\r\nquadrate bones have become more or less immovable.\r\n\r\nWe divide the Autosauri into three sub-orders:–I. GECKONES, p. 502; II.\r\nLACERTAE, p. 513; III. CHAMAELEONTES, p. 567, with about 270, 1500, and 50\r\nspecies respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Autosauri are of great interest, since they exhibit a great, almost\r\nendless variety in shape, size, and structure in direct adaptation to their\r\nsurroundings. Most of these modifications are restricted to the external\r\norgans, or rather to those which come into direct contact with the outer\r\nworld, namely the skin, the limbs, the tail, or the tongue. The majority of\r\nthe Autosauri are terrestrial, but there are also semi-aquatic forms. There\r\nare climbing, swiftly running, and even flying forms, while others lead a\r\nsubterranean life like earthworms. Most of them live on animal food,\r\nvarying from tiny insects and worms to Birds and Mammals, while others live\r\nupon vegetable diet. According to this diet, the teeth and the whole\r\ndigestive tract are modified. The intestine is relatively short in the\r\ncarnivorous, long in the herbivorous species. But swiftness, the apparatus\r\nnecessary for climbing, running, and digging, the mechanism of the tongue,\r\nthe armament and the muscles of the jaws (hence modifications of the\r\ncranial arches, etc.), stand also in correlation with the kind of food and\r\nwith the way in which it has to be procured.\r\n\r\nA very interesting study of the influence of the climate and the nature of\r\nthe country upon Reptiles has been made by Boettger[147] with especial\r\nreference to the Transcaspian desert-region. The winter is there short, but\r\nvery severe, and there is a considerable amount of snowfall, while the\r\nsummer is intolerably hot. The spring arrives suddenly. Lilies and tulips,\r\nwhich have been asleep for nine or ten months, sprout towards the end of\r\nFebruary, and a carpet of flowers covers the ground for a short time. Then\r\neverything shrivels up during the rainless and fierce heat of the summer,\r\nand the autumnal storms of dust and sand kill off the last remnants of\r\nvegetation. There are no trees, and even prickly shrubs are rare. Instead\r\nof broad leaves the plants have grass-like blades or needles. The little\r\nshrubs do not form coherent patches, but they are scattered {493}about, and\r\naround the roots of each shrub the wind accumulates little mounds of sand\r\nand dust, a place of retreat for rodents, lizards, snakes, and even for the\r\nfemale tortoises. G. Kadde's \"law of the steppe\" is in full force;–there is\r\nlittle change of forms in a wide district, but all these forms are\r\npeculiar, and they congregate socially in great numbers. Most\r\ncharacteristic are those kinds of Geckos which, like _Teratoscincus_, cf.\r\np. 507, have become inhabitants of sand instead of climbers of rocks and\r\ntrees; various kinds of _Phrynocephalus_, cf. p. 521, and _Varanus\r\ngriseus_; the four desert-species of Lacertidae are brownish-grey or sandy\r\nyellow, with conspicuous stripes or spots. Of snakes are to be mentioned\r\n_Eryx jaculus_, digging in the sand, and about ten other non-poisonous\r\nsnakes. _Tropidonotus_ is, of course, restricted to permanently watery\r\nplaces, where they can get frogs and fishes. Of poisonous snakes there is\r\nthe Cobra and _Echis arenicola_. Of Amphibia only _Bufo viridis_ and _Rana\r\nesculenta_ var. _ridibunda_ exist in suitable places, but there are neither\r\nTree-frogs nor Newts.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic features of these inhabitants of the desert are the\r\nfollowing:–\r\n\r\n1. Velocity. The Lizards are slender. The Sand-snake, _Tephrometopon_, is\r\nwhip-like; even the Cobra has a relatively narrower and longer tail than\r\nthe Indian specimens, although the number of the vertebrae and of the\r\nscales is the same. All the desert-snakes are remarkable for the great\r\nnumber of their ventral shields, two hundred and more.\r\n\r\n2. Hard, scaly covering, for instance in _Agama_, _Echis_, _Gymnodactylus_,\r\n_Teratoscincus_; the latter with its fish-like scales is exceptional among\r\nGeckos, resembling the likewise deserticolous _Geckolepis_ and _Homopholis_\r\nof Africa.\r\n\r\n3. Capacity for digging in the sand in order to escape great cold, or\r\nburning heat. All the Lizards and the Tortoise, _Testudo horsfieldi_, have\r\nstrong claws. The snakes _Typhlops_ and _Eryx_ dig with their specially\r\nmodified snouts, and their tails are very short and blunt. The Sand-viper,\r\n_Echis_, has the scales of the back arranged in very oblique rows, so that\r\nit can heap sand upon its body by wriggling, shaking, and up-and-down\r\nmotions of the body. The Agamoid _Phrynocephalus_ does this by means of\r\nlateral folds of the skin.\r\n\r\n4. Arrangements for running on sand. The lizard _Eremias_ {494}has very\r\nlarge crural shields; _Scapteira_ has the digits broadened out into\r\nshovels; others, e.g. _Phrynocephalus_ and _Teratoscincus_, have long\r\nlateral fringes on the digits, a very rare arrangement among Geckos,\r\noccurring elsewhere among them only in _Ptenopus_ and _Stenodactylus_,\r\nwhich are likewise inhabitants of the desert.\r\n\r\n5. Protection against the everlasting, ubiquitous sand. In the digging\r\nspecies the nostrils are directed upwards instead of forwards; in most of\r\nthe snakes they are protected by complicated valves, or they are reduced to\r\nsmall pin-holes. The eyes of _Typhlops_ are overhung by the head-shields.\r\nIn _Agama_ and _Phrynocephalus_ the margins of the lids are broadened into\r\nplates and are furnished with peculiar scales. In _Teratoscincus_ the upper\r\nlid is enlarged. The lizard _Mabuia_ has the lower lid much enlarged, with\r\na transparent window in it, so that the eye can be closed without impeding\r\nsight, an arrangement carried to the extreme in _Ablepharus_, cf. p. 560.\r\nThe ear-opening is either small, or protected by fringes of scales, or it\r\nis abolished, _e.g._ in _Phrynocephalus_.\r\n\r\n6. Coloration. Pure green is quite absent, even in _Bufo viridis_ and in\r\n_Rana esculenta_, since there is no green in that country, at least not of\r\nlong duration. White, with grey and black spots, occurs only in the\r\nnocturnal Geckos.  Yellow, brownish, reddish colours are common, in\r\nadaptation to the sand. The advantages of the carmine-red, and of the blue\r\nspots of _Phrynocephalus_, and the yellow or bright red under surface of\r\nits tail, are unknown. Striation is of frequent occurrence among the\r\nlizards and snakes, probably in adaptation to the dry grass heaped up\r\naround the scattered shrubs.\r\n\r\nConcerning the various organic systems of the Autosauri only some of the\r\nmore important features may here be mentioned.\r\n\r\nSKELETON.–The vertebrae are procoelous, with the exception of most of the\r\nGeckones, in which they are amphicoelous. So-called intercentra, in the\r\nshape of unpaired nodules or wedges, persist between most of the cervical\r\nvertebrae. In the tail these wedges, the remnants of the basiventralia, are\r\ngenerally present, frequently in the shape of chevron-bones. Sometimes they\r\nfuse with the centra of the vertebrae; occasionally the axial or central\r\nportion of these basiventrals persists as a sort of fibrous disc, which may\r\ncalcify separately, and is interposed between the caudal end of the centrum\r\nand the articulating {495}knob. The caudal vertebrae of the Geckones and of\r\nmost Lacertae are liable to break across, like those of _Sphenodon_. They\r\nare enabled to do this owing to a transverse split, which makes its\r\nappearance with the ossification of the vertebral bodies and extends later\r\ninto and across the neural arch and the various lateral processes. The\r\nsplit is ultimately referable to a transverse septum of cartilage, wrongly\r\ncalled chordal cartilage, which develops in the shell of the body of the\r\nvertebra, destroys the chorda, and extends peripherally. The cells of this\r\nseptum retain throughout life their juvenile quasi-embryonic character.\r\nWhen the tail is broken off–and this always happens at such a septum–the\r\ncells of the remaining half reproduce a new tail. The latter is, however,\r\nin reality a sham tail, since neither new centra nor arches, but only a\r\nnon-segmented rod or tube of fibro-cartilage is produced by this process of\r\nregeneration. Reproduction of centra is precluded by the previous normal\r\nreduction of the chorda, around which alone proper bony centra could be\r\nformed. The regenerated tail is, however, invested with new muscles, and\r\nwith skin, but the scales often differ considerably from those of the\r\nnormal organ. Boulenger[148] has found that the new or aberrant scaling is\r\nin some cases a reversion to an ancestral form. This is, for instance, the\r\ncase in _Pseudopus_, and in the Tejoid genus _Gymnophthalmus_; to a certain\r\nextent also in Geckos and Skinks. On the other hand, Lacertidae,\r\nGerrhosauridae, and also Anguidae reproduce a caudal scaling true to their\r\ntype. Injured or broken-off tails are often reproduced double, or even\r\ntrifid; sometimes an additional little tail grows out from an injured spot,\r\nanywhere on the side of the old remaining but mended tail.\r\n\r\nThe ribs of the trunk articulate by their capitula only, while the reduced\r\ntubercula are attached to their vertebrae by ligaments. In the tail the\r\ncapitular portion is much reduced, while the tuberculum is much stronger\r\nand lies behind, no longer above, the capitulum, fusing sometimes directly\r\nwith the centrum. The ribs of the poststernal region of Geckos and\r\nChameleons are very long, and meet each other in the middle line, forming\r\nthin cartilaginous hoops.\r\n\r\nThe limbs are of the typical pentadactyloid type. The distal tarsalia are\r\noften fused with the metatarsals, so that the chief {496}bending of the\r\nfoot is effected by truly intertarsal joints. The greatest modification\r\noccurs in the foot of the Chameleons, in which the proximal tarsalia are\r\nreduced in number, and form a globe for the articulation with the tibia and\r\nfibula.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder-girdle and sternum much resemble that of _Sphenodon_ in their\r\ncompleteness. The coracoids articulate with the sternum; the precoracoids\r\nand the basal parts of the scapulae often send out several processes\r\ntowards those of the other side, so that several fenestrae are formed. The\r\nclavicles are complete, but are absent in the Chameleons. The interclavicle\r\nis mostly T-shaped. A presternum is absent, but the sternum proper is well\r\ndeveloped, often forming a rhomboid plate, usually cartilaginous, often\r\ndiverging backwards into xiphisternal processes.\r\n\r\nThe pelvis is attached to two vertebrae by means of several ribs. The\r\nischium and pubis form symphyses. The pubis carries a well-developed\r\nlateral process, and the obturator-nerve pierces the shaft of the pubis.\r\nEpipubic and hypo-ischial cartilages are of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nThe hyoid apparatus consists of a median, styliform rod, which extends\r\nforwards into the tongue; it is often bifid behind. The unpaired piece\r\ncarries two pairs of horns. The posterior of these, the first pair of\r\nbranchial arches, extends backwards along the gullet, and is very long if\r\nthe tongue is very slender and protractile. The anterior pair, the hyoid\r\narches, consists of two pieces on either side, one short and directed\r\nforwards, the other long, connected with the former at a sharp angle and\r\ncontinued upwards to the sides of the skull, often in direct continuity\r\nwith the columellar chain of the ear.\r\n\r\nThe modifications of the skull concern chiefly the composition of the\r\ntemporal arches, see Figs. 55, M, N, O, p. 281. The quadrate bone is\r\nmovable, but it has become fixed in various degraded families, where the\r\nskull shows a great reduction and concentration; the postorbital and\r\ntemporal arches, the interorbital septum, and with it the columellae cranii\r\nare lost. The columella cranii of the Chameleons, which is generally stated\r\nto be absent, is really present, although in a much reduced state, and is\r\npartly imbedded in the interorbital septum. The occipital condyle has\r\nbecome bifid in Amphisbaenidae.\r\n\r\nBurrowing and living in sand are often correlated with partial or complete\r\nreduction or loss of the limbs and their {497}girdles. This loss of limbs\r\nis as a rule correlated with an elongation of the trunk, not always at the\r\nexpense of the tail, which in such cases is much shortened. The vestiges of\r\nthe hind-limbs come to lie as near the vent as possible. This reduction of\r\nthe limbs occurred in several families which are not directly related to\r\neach other. Moreover, it does not occur in all the members of the family,\r\nnot always in those of the same genus, and there is a considerable amount\r\nof individual variation. In most cases of reduction the fore-limbs\r\ndisappear before, or are smaller than, the hind-limbs. In the\r\nAmphisbaenidae (cf. _Chirotes_, p. 566), and in the Tejidae the reverse\r\ntakes place. In extreme cases the reduction is so complete that even the\r\npectoral girdle has disappeared, leaving scarcely any trace, _e.g._ in\r\n_Dibamus_, p. 564.\r\n\r\nThe SKIN is normally covered with scales, which are formed by the cutis and\r\nhave a horny epidermal coating. The latter, thin and transparent, is shed\r\nperiodically, peeling off in flakes, except in _Anguis_ and perhaps other\r\nsnake-shaped creatures, which shed the skin in one piece. In the\r\nAmphisbaenidae the scales have practically disappeared. When well developed\r\nthe scales are prominent, and imbricate or overlap with their free\r\nposterior edges; but in many cases the scales are not \"scale-like\" at all,\r\nonly like little tubercles, which give the skin a granular appearance.\r\nFrequently, for instance in the Scincidae and Anguidae, all the scales\r\ncontain \"osteoderms,\" or ossified portions of the cutis, and encase the\r\nwhole body and tail. In other families, _e.g._ Lacertidae, such osteoderms\r\nare restricted to the scales or shields on the head, where they come into\r\ncontact and fuse with the underlying cranial bones, and moreover roof in\r\nthe supratemporal fossa.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the Autosauri is entirely devoid of glands. The femoral and\r\npre-anal pores of many families, occurring especially in the males, are\r\nprobably not glands. They are arranged in rows on the under surface of the\r\nthighs and in front of the anal opening. Each of these organs perforates a\r\nscale and leads into a tubular invagination, which is lined with epidermal\r\ncells, the proliferation of which produces a horny yellowish débris, and\r\nthis fills the tube and appears above the surface in the shape of a little\r\ncone. The use of this \"excretion\" is unknown; it is possibly hedonic.\r\n\r\n{498}Most Autosauri are capable of changing colour. In most of them this\r\nfaculty is restricted to the assumption of paler or darker tints owing to\r\nthe shifting of the colouring matter contained in the chromatophores. In\r\nothers new, often vivid colours are the result. The mechanism is described\r\nin detail in the Chameleon on pp. 570 and 574.\r\n\r\nPigment is deposited either directly in the upper strata of the cutis, just\r\nbelow the Malpighian layer, or it is contained in chromatophores. The\r\nlatter are imbedded in the deeper layers of the cutis, and send out movable\r\ncontractile processes, in which their pigmented protoplasm is conveyed\r\ntowards or away from the surface. The only colours available are black,\r\nred, yellow, and white, with their combinations of grey and brown. The\r\nwhite pigment consists of guanin-salts. Blue and green are structural\r\ncolours, not due to pigment. The same can no longer be said of the Ophidia,\r\nsince Boulenger has observed accidentally that green Tree-snakes (e.g.\r\n_Dryophis_) give the alcohol in which they are kept the colour of green\r\nChartreuse.\r\n\r\nDIGESTIVE ORGANS.–The tongue is very variably developed, and affords good\r\ntaxonomic characters. It is always furnished with many tactile, or with\r\ngustatory, corpuscles. When the tongue is very long and narrow it is\r\ngenerally forked, and in these cases, for instance in the Varanidae, is\r\nalmost entirely used as a sensory organ. In others, especially where it is\r\nbroad, it assists in catching the food, and in the Chameleons it has\r\nattained a most elaborate development (see p. 569).\r\n\r\nSalivary glands are restricted to labial glands. In _Heloderma_ those of\r\nthe lower jaw are transformed into poison-glands, an analogy to what\r\nprevails in the poisonous snakes. The intestinal canal is longest in the\r\nherbivorous forms; the rectum sometimes possesses a short blind sac or\r\ncaecum.\r\n\r\nThe CLOACA of the Sauria is somewhat modified; instead of the Coprodaeum,\r\nUrodaeum, and Proctodaeum forming three successive chambers, the urodaeum\r\nis practically reduced to its dorsal half, forming a dorsal recess between\r\nthe two other chambers. The Coprodaeum is constricted into several\r\nsuccessive chambers, and is always well shut off from the urodaeum by a\r\nstrong sphincter. The urodaeum receives the urinary excretions, which are\r\nmostly chalky white and are rather consistent instead of being fluid. The\r\nright and left oviducts also open into it. The vasa {499}deferentia open\r\ninto the dorso-lateral portions of the walls of the urodaeum, but the\r\nsperma is conducted by folds of the lining of this chamber towards the\r\nbases of the copulatory organs, which, although arising from the lateral\r\nand posterior corners of the cloaca, where uro- and procto-daeum meet, are\r\nstowed away outside the cloaca. These organs are always paired. The\r\nproctodaeum or outermost cloacal chamber is shallow. Its inner opening is\r\nround and is furnished with a sphincter, but it is surrounded and covered\r\nby lips of the outer skin, which form a transverse slit. This is due to the\r\npeculiar arrangement of the copulatory organs.\r\n\r\nEach organ consists of a tube of erectile tissue, and can be everted like\r\nthe finger of a glove. To the apex of the tube is attached a long retractor\r\nmuscle, which arises from the ventro-lateral surfaces of the caudal\r\nvertebrae and extends a considerable distance back. When at rest and\r\nwithdrawn the organs form slight conical, longitudinal swellings on either\r\nside of the root of the tail, an external feature by which male specimens\r\ncan generally be distinguished. Only one organ is inserted at one time.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Autosauri lay EGGS, surrounded by a white or yellowish\r\nshell, which is either hard, for instance in Geckos, or parchment-like,\r\n_e.g._ in Chameleons, in _Lacerta viridis_ and _L. agilis_, and in _L.\r\nvivipara_. Eggs with a thin and soft shell sometimes exhibit the\r\nparadoxical feature of increasing in size after they have been laid. This\r\nis explained by the growth of the embryo, which stretches the shell and\r\ndoes not merely live upon the white and yellow contents of the egg itself,\r\nbut also takes in air and moisture. Many Lizards do not lay their eggs\r\nuntil they contain ripe embryos, which burst the shell shortly after\r\ndeposition. Some, for instance _Lacerta vivipara_, _Anguis fragilis_, and\r\n_Chamaeleo pumilus_, are practically viviparous. The embryos, especially\r\nthose which are enclosed in hard-shelled eggs, are provided with a sharp,\r\ncalcareous \"egg-tooth\" on the top of the snout.\r\n\r\nThe LUNGS are thin-walled sacs, sometimes provided with lateral\r\nex-sacculations, and these reach their greatest development in the\r\nChameleons. The breathing is effected by the motion of the ribs. Inflatable\r\nsacs on the throat, or on the sides of the neck, for ornamental or sexual\r\npurposes, occur in various families. The lungs of much-elongated,\r\nsnake-shaped Lizards are generally {500}asymmetrical; the right being\r\nreduced in Amphisbaenidae; the left in other cases.\r\n\r\nSeveral Autosauri, for instance the Geckos, _Psammodromus_, and various\r\nother Lacertidae have a weak voice.\r\n\r\nThe FAT-BODIES are mysterious organs which are situated beneath the skin,\r\nand extend from the inguinal region forwards along the ventral sides of the\r\nbelly. They are often of considerable dimensions; largest in the spring, in\r\nboth sexes, at the time of propagation. Their colour is greyish-white or\r\nyellow, owing to the great accumulation of fat in the meshes of the\r\nconnective tissue which composes the frame-work of these organs. An artery\r\nenters them, breaks up into capillaries, and these combine to form an\r\nefferent vein. After the time of propagation these organs are reduced to\r\ngrey or reddish flaps, consisting mainly of very vascular connective\r\ntissue. G. W. Butler[149] has written a long paper on their morphology. The\r\nsame author[150] has investigated the \"sub-divisions of the body-cavity in\r\nLizards, Crocodiles, and Birds,\" with reference to peritoneal diaphragmatic\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nThe GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE AUTOSAURI teaches few, but important\r\nlessons. We have to restrict ourselves to the principal families, leaving\r\nout those which are small and have a limited distribution; also those\r\nwhich, like the few Anelytropidae in Africa and in Mexico, are not natural\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nThe Geckones, which are probably the oldest of modern Autosauri, are\r\npractically cosmopolitan, being absent only in the cold and in the cooler\r\ntemperate regions. They are common even in Oceanic Islands, for instance in\r\nNew Zealand and in the Sandwich Islands. Although not at all aquatic, they\r\nare particularly fit to be transported accidentally on or in the trunks of\r\nfloating trees, to which they cling firmly, and they can exist without food\r\nfor months. I once received a little South American Gecko in perfect health\r\nfrom a grocer, who found it in a well-closed wooden box containing canned\r\nmeat, two months after delivery of the box in Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe Scincidae, likewise an old family, are equally cosmopolitan, but\r\nalthough many exist in the islands of the Pacific a few only occur in New\r\nZealand. Many of the genera have a very wide distribution; for instance,\r\n_Lygosoma_, with its one hundred and sixty or more species, occurs in the\r\nAustralian and {501}Palaeotropical regions, and also in North and Central\r\nAmerica, not extending, however, into South America. _Mabuia_, with more\r\nthan sixty species, occurs in the Palaeotropical and the Neotropical\r\nregions. Whether these and other widely-distributed genera are all natural\r\nis another question.\r\n\r\nThe Agamidae, Varanidae, Lacertidae, and the Chamaeleontes are restricted\r\nto the Old World. The Agamidae and Varanidae have the widest distribution,\r\noccurring in the whole of the Old World with the notable exception of\r\nMadagascar and New Zealand. The Lacertidae are Palaearctic and\r\nPalaeotropical, being however absent in Madagascar, and, broadly speaking,\r\nnot extending eastwards beyond Wallace's line. It is a most suggestive fact\r\nthat most of those families of Reptiles, and even of other Vertebrates\r\nwhich have a wide distribution and are apparently debarred from\r\ntransgressing Wallace's line, are also absent from Madagascar.\r\n\r\nThe Chameleons are essentially African, with their centre of greatest\r\nabundance and development in Madagascar, only one or two species occurring\r\nin Socotra, Southern Arabia, and in Ceylon and Southern India. Since they\r\nalso exist, _Ch. sechellensis_, on various islands in the Indian Ocean, for\r\ninstance in Mauritius and the Seychelles, the Chameleons are perhaps an\r\nindication of the former existence of a direct land-connexion between\r\nSouthern India and Southern Africa.\r\n\r\nThe Iguanidae are essentially American, with the remarkable exceptions of\r\n_Chalarodon_ and _Hoplurus_ in Madagascar, and _Brachylophus_ in the Fiji\r\nand Friendly Islands. This peculiar distribution finds some analogies in\r\nthat of Dendrobatinae (p. 272), certain Boinae (p. 601), and _Centetes_ and\r\n_Solenodon_ among Insectivora. An Iguana (_I. europaea_) has, however, been\r\ndescribed from the Eocene of France and England. The supposed relationship\r\nof the Iguanidae with the Agamidae makes the problem only more puzzling,\r\nsince Agamidae are absent in Madagascar. If we have recourse to the\r\nZonuridae, which are confined to Africa and Madagascar, and are supposed to\r\nbe intermediate between Anguidae and Iguanidae, then we may have ultimately\r\nto conclude that the Malagasy Iguanoid genera and the American Iguanidae\r\nare a case of convergent evolution.\r\n\r\nThe Amphisbaenidae are distributed over America, including the West Indies,\r\nAfrica exclusive of Madagascar, and the {502}Mediterranean countries. This\r\nis very puzzling, considering that these subterranean, helpless creatures\r\npositively cannot travel. Boulenger regards them \"as a degraded type of the\r\nTejidae, with which they are to some extent connected by _Chalcides_ and\r\nits allies,\" _i.e._ genera with reduced limbs, cf. p. 562.\r\n\r\nHowever, this supposed relationship with a strictly American family does\r\nnot explain the occurrence of Amphisbaenidae in Africa. Either they are not\r\na natural group, or they had, as already degraded, limbless creatures, a\r\nmuch wider range; and this would imply their being a very old family,\r\nperhaps as old as we suppose the Coecilians to be.\r\n\r\nAnguidae occur in North and South America, in Europe and the Mediterranean\r\nparts of North Africa, and in Trans-Gangetic India. Their older relations,\r\nthe Zonuridae, inhabit Africa and Madagascar.\r\n\r\nMadagascar is consequently devoid of Agamidae, Varanidae, Lacertidae,\r\nAnguidae, and Amphisbaenidae, while it possesses, besides the cosmopolitan\r\nScincidae and Geckones, only Chameleons, Gerrhosauridae, and Zonuridae,–all\r\nthree essentially African families,–and a few Iguanidae. This means that\r\nthe Autosaurian fauna of Madagascar is intimately related to that of\r\nAfrica, and that it possesses only old families so far as Sauria are\r\nconcerned. But since this great island was separated from its continent not\r\nearlier than in Mid-Tertiary times, it follows that most of these \"old\"\r\nfamilies are comparatively recent.\r\n\r\nAustralia possesses only Agamidae and Varanidae besides the ubiquitous\r\nGeckos and Skinks. Besides the latter two families it has nothing in common\r\neither with Madagascar (an analogy with the Anura) or with America. The\r\nAutosauri consequently do not support the idea of a Notogaea, cf. p. 74.\r\nThis again indicates the comparatively recent age of Autosaurian families.\r\nThe marked difference which exists between the Old and the New World points\r\nto the same conclusion. On the other hand, the Autosauri support the idea\r\nthat the Palaeotropical region is but the tropical and therefore richer\r\ncontinuation of the now impoverished Palaearctic sub-region.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 1. GECKONES.–The typical Geckos are characterised as follows.\r\n_Four-footed Autosauri with amphicoelous vertebrae; skull without bony\r\ntemporal arches; clavicles dilated and with a perforation near the ventral\r\nend; parietal bones {503}separate; eyes (with few exceptions) without\r\nmovable lids; pleurodont; tongue fleshy and broad, slightly nicked\r\nanteriorly, and capable of protrusion._\r\n\r\nThis definition does not apply to a few forms. In the _Eublepharinae_ the\r\nvertebrae have advanced to the procoelous condition, and the parietals are\r\nfused together, while the eyes are provided with typical, movable lids. In\r\nthe _Uroplatinae_ the clavicles are not dilated, and the nasals are fused\r\ninto one bone. The Geckos seem to be not only a very independent but also a\r\nvery old branch of Saurians. Although fossil representatives are unknown,\r\nthe resemblance of their vertebrae to those of the Palaeozoic Microsauri is\r\nat least remarkable. They are now practically cosmopolitan within the\r\nwarmer zones, being found in abundance in all intertropical countries and\r\nislands, even in New Zealand. About two hundred and seventy species are\r\nknown, which have been subdivided into about fifty genera. The generic\r\ndifferences are trivial with few exceptions, and refer mostly to the\r\nstructure of the digits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.–Map showing the distribution of Geckonidae.]\r\n\r\nThe more important features of the vertebral column are the absence of\r\naxial joints and the persistence and life-long growth of the chorda\r\ndorsalis. Each vertebral centrum consists of a cartilaginous tube, more or\r\nless calcified or ossified, with a narrow waist and a cartilaginous septum\r\nin the middle. In the tail this septum, which is only slightly invaded by\r\nossification, coincides exactly with the line of transverse division of the\r\nvertebrae into an anterior and a posterior half. This is the level where\r\nthe tail breaks off and whence it is renewed. Between every two successive\r\ncentra lies an intercentrum, broadest ventrally, crescent- {504}or\r\nwedge-shaped. Dorsally it is continued as fibro-cartilage, and the whole\r\nring acts as an articular pad instead of the joint. Chevron-bones are\r\ncommon in the tail.\r\n\r\nThe ribs are bifurcated, but the tubercular portion is frequently reduced.\r\nThe post-thoracic ribs are usually very slender, and so long that they meet\r\neach other in the middle line, in this case bearing an extraordinary\r\nresemblance to the so-called \"abdominal ribs\" of other reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe bony frame of the skull is slender. There is a complete absence of bony\r\narches spanning over the temporal fossae, or bordering the orbit, which is\r\nopen posteriorly. The upper jaw, owing to the slender and flexible nature\r\nof the respective bones, is movable upon the rest of the skull; in this\r\nrespect not unlike the upper jaw of a duck. The dentition is pleurodont and\r\nthe teeth are minute. The eyes of the typical Geckos are peculiar. They are\r\ncovered with an absolutely transparent skin, shaped like a watch-glass,\r\nbeneath which the eye moves freely, while the true upper and lower lids are\r\nreduced to tiny folds. The covering \"watch-glass\" is probably a\r\nmodification of the nictitating membrane. In the Eublepharinae, however,\r\nand in the few species of the Geckonine genera _Aelurosaurus_ of Borneo and\r\nAustralia, and _Ptenopus_ of South Africa, the upper and lower lids are\r\npresent and movable. The pupil contracts mostly into a vertical slit,\r\nexcept in the few diurnal kinds, e.g. _Phelsuma_, of the islands in the\r\nIndian Ocean, and the African _Lygodactylus_.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiarity of at least many Geckos is the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of the endo-lymphatic sacs of the ear, which, being filled with\r\nthe chalk-like otoconia or otolithic crystals, perforate the skull, and are\r\nstowed away in the shape of a pair of large bags behind the ears, or on the\r\nsides of the neck.\r\n\r\nThe skin exhibits considerable variety. It is mostly soft above, with\r\nlittle granular tubercles, sometimes containing small dermal ossifications\r\nor calcifications. The latter are most developed on the head, where they\r\noccasionally fuse with the underlying bones. A few species of _Tarentola_\r\npossess supra-orbital bones, independent remnants of such osteoderms. The\r\nventral surface is generally covered with small imbricating scales, but in\r\nsome genera, e.g. _Homopholis_, such scales occur also on the dorsal\r\nsurface, reaching their highest development in _Teratoscincus_ (p. 507). In\r\na few forms, notably in _Ptychozoon_ {505}(p. 512), the skin of the sides\r\nof the body and tail is produced into a series of lobes and flaps, the\r\nobject of which seems to assist adhesion. Many, perhaps the majority of\r\nGeckos, have adhesive digits, by means of which some kinds are enabled to\r\nclimb absolutely smooth and vertical surfaces, for instance a window-pane;\r\nor, what is more startling, they run along the smooth, white-washed\r\nceiling, back downwards. The apparatus is complicated in its minute detail,\r\nbut is very simple in principle. The adhesion is effected neither by sticky\r\nmatter, nor in the way described in the Anura (p. 187), but by small and\r\nnumerous vacua. The under surface of each digit is furnished with many\r\ntransverse lamellae. The pressing down of the foot upon a smooth surface\r\ncauses the lamellae to spread asunder and to drive out the air; partial\r\nretraction lets them return to their original position by virtue of their\r\nelasticity; and little vacua are produced. Each lamella is further beset\r\nwith tiny hair-like excrescences, which secure adpression to even the\r\nslightest irregularity of surface and at the same time enhance the\r\nelasticity of the pads. The arrangement of the lamellae and pads differs\r\nmuch in the various genera. For instance, the lamellae are either broad and\r\nentire, or they are divided into two parallel rows, with or without lateral\r\nhairy fringes; or the under surface of the digits is granular, but strongly\r\nfringed; or the lamellae are restricted to the dilated tips of the digits,\r\netc. The fingers and toes are mostly furnished with sharp, curved claws,\r\nand these are in many cases retractile between some of the lamellae, or\r\ninto a special sheath. Those Geckos which live on sandy, barren ground are\r\nas a rule devoid of adhesive pads, the digits being narrow. The typically\r\npadded, adhesive digits cause a peculiar sensation when a Gecko hangs on to\r\none's finger, and this feeling has perhaps given rise to the erroneous\r\nnotion of stickiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.–_Ptychozoon homalocephalum._ A, Ventral view of\r\nthe right hand. × 2. B, Side view of a finger to show the peculiar\r\narrangement of the claw-bearing joint.]\r\n\r\nThe tail exhibits many kinds of shape and size. Mostly {506}cylindrical and\r\ntapering to a point, it is leaf-like in _Gymnodactylus platurus_ of\r\nAustralia; provided with many lobes, and used as a parachute in the Malay\r\n_Ptychozoon_. In _Nephrurus asper_ of Eastern Australia the tail is quite\r\nshort, much shorter than the limbs, much swollen at the base, and very thin\r\ntowards the end, which carries a round knob. The tail of all Geckos is very\r\nbrittle and can be quickly regenerated, except the long rat-like tail of\r\nthe Persian _Agamura_. In many other desert-forms the tail is long,\r\nslender, and laterally compressed, acting in such cases like that of\r\ndesert-forms among the Lizards.\r\n\r\nMany Geckos have a voice, mostly rather feeble, and sounding like a soft\r\n\"click\" or \"chick\" produced by our tongue. Repetition of this sound\r\nresembles in some species the word \"gecko.\" They lay eggs, rather globular,\r\nor but slightly oval, hard-shelled, and white, mostly two in number.\r\n_Naultinus elegans_ of New Zealand is said to be viviparous. The males are\r\ngenerally larger than the females, and they are further distinguished by\r\nthe possession of femoral or pre-anal pores.\r\n\r\nAll Geckos feed upon animals, chiefly upon insects, but the larger forms\r\ntake anything they can master. With few exceptions they are nocturnal,\r\nwhich, however, does not prevent them from occasionally baking themselves\r\nin the sun. They are capable of changing colour, but since their\r\nground-colour is almost universally grey, yellow, or brown, the range of\r\nthe colour-changes is restricted to the adoption of darker or lighter hues.\r\nThe skin is shed in flakes and eaten.\r\n\r\nGeckos are absolutely harmless; they cannot even inflict painful bites.\r\nHowever, in many countries they are feared as much or even more than the\r\nmost poisonous snakes. In the south of Spain and Portugal, for instance,\r\nwhere Geckos are plentiful in and outside the houses, and are consequently\r\nobjects of daily observation, the \"_osga_\" is considered a dreadfully\r\npoisonous creature. They become very tame, or rather confiding in their\r\nregular habits, provided they are not molested. If caught–and they have\r\nmany enemies among other lizards and snakes–the only safety of these\r\ndefenceless and mostly small creatures lies in their tail, which, being\r\nextremely brittle, is left in the claws or jaws of the pursuer. The\r\nremaining stump soon produces a new tail, in shape and size like the old\r\none, but with a different and simpler scaling. I knew of several specimens\r\nof {507}the Portuguese _Platydactylus facetanus_, which, having lost their\r\ntails in the act of being caught, were kept in a box for six weeks without\r\nfood. On their arrival in England they had each grown a new stump nearly\r\nhalf an inch long!\r\n\r\nFAM. GECKONIDAE. SUB-FAM. 1. GECKONINAE.–Vertebrae amphicoelous; parietal\r\nbones separate; clavicles dilated and perforated. Hereto belong the\r\noverwhelming majority of Geckos, only a few of which can be mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Teratoscincus scincus._–This most peculiar creature, about six inches in\r\nlength, inhabits the steppes of Turkestan and neighbouring desert-regions\r\nof Persia. It is a thorough desert-form. The digits are devoid of adhesive\r\nlamellae, but are granular inferiorly and strongly fringed laterally, an\r\narrangement which is rare among Geckos, practically restricted to it with\r\n_Ptenopus_ and _Stenodactylus_, which are likewise deserticolous. This is a\r\nbeautiful illustration of adaptation to the surroundings. A Gecko, instead\r\nof climbing rocks and trees, has lost the climbing apparatus, or has\r\ntransformed parts of it for running upon loose sand. The body is covered\r\nwith imbricating, rather large and smooth scales. The tail is round at the\r\nbase, compressed in its posterior half, covered below and on the sides with\r\nscales like those of the body, but on the upper side with a series of\r\nlarge, transverse, nail-like plates. By rubbing these plates upon each\r\nother, this Gecko produces a shrill, cricket-like noise, sitting at night\r\nin front of his house, perhaps in order to attract grasshoppers. The noise\r\nis made by both sexes.\r\n\r\n_Ptenopus_, a Gecko of Damara Land, likewise adapted to desert-life,\r\nproduces a similar chirping noise by its throat.\r\n\r\n_Phyllodactylus_ is a genus of world-wide distribution, occurring in\r\ntropical America, Africa, Madagascar, and Australia, extending to the\r\nNorfolk Islands and to Lord Howe's Island. One species, _Ph. europaeus_,\r\noccurs on the islands in the Western Mediterranean. The digits are\r\nfurnished with transverse lamellae, the greater number of which are broken\r\nup into small scales forming three longitudinal series. The ends of the\r\ndigits are dilated, with two large plates inferiorly, separated by a\r\nlongitudinal groove into which the claw is retracted. The upper parts of\r\nthe body are covered with juxtaposed scales intermixed with larger\r\ntubercles. The abdominal scales are small and imbricating. The cylindrical,\r\ntapering tail is slightly prehensile, covered with {508}small scales\r\narranged in verticils. This species is devoid of femoral or anal pores.\r\nGeneral colour above grey-brown, with darker and lighter markings; a dark\r\nstreak on the side of the head, passing through the eye. Under parts\r\nwhitish. Total length up to 3 inches. The eggs are almost round, measuring\r\n8.7 by 7 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.–_Hemidactylus turcicus_ (left), and _Tarentola\r\nmauritanica_ (right). × 1.]\r\n\r\n_Hemidactylus_, likewise a widely distributed genus, with many species. The\r\ndigits are dilated, inferiorly with two rows of lamellae; the clawed joints\r\nare slender, bent at an angle, and rising from within the extremity of the\r\ndilated portion. _H. turcicus_, between 3 and 4 inches long.–The upper\r\nparts of the body are covered with minute granules, mixed with larger\r\ntubercles. The abdominal scales are small and slightly imbricating. The\r\nmale has several pre-anal pores. The tail is covered above with minute\r\nscales and tubercles, below with a series of large transversely dilated\r\nplates. The general colour is white below, brown above, with darker spots,\r\nand with white specks on many of the tubercles. This species extends from\r\n{509}Southern Portugal and Spain to Karachi. Like _Phyllodactylus_ and\r\nvarious other kinds of Geckos, the body is semi-transparent; so much so\r\nindeed that the white eggs shimmer through the body in certain lights.\r\n\r\n_Tarentola mauritanica_ s. _Platydactylus facetanus_.–The digits are\r\nstrongly dilated, with undivided lamellae below, and a flat, nail-like\r\nscute on their upper surface near the tip. Only the third and fourth digits\r\nare clawed. Femoral or pre-anal pores are absent. The upper parts are\r\ncovered with scales and granules, and bear several longitudinal rows of\r\nstrongly keeled, large tubercles; the under parts have hexagonal scales.\r\nGeneral colour above greyish-brown, with darker or lighter markings; with a\r\ndark streak through the eye. Total length of large males about 6 inches.\r\nThis species is one of the commonest Geckos in the Southern Mediterranean\r\ncountries. In Portugal it extends northwards to the Douro. It has been\r\nintroduced by ships into the ports of Cette, Toulon, and Marseilles. It is\r\neasily kept in captivity, like most Geckos indeed, provided they are\r\nsupplied with a variety of insect-food, water in the shape of drops, and\r\nsuitable places to hide in. A female, which I had received from Algiers in\r\na little tin box, with a lump of meat (presumably its food!), laid two eggs\r\nsix weeks after its arrival. This was towards the end of April. Towards the\r\nend of June in the same year it again laid two eggs, measuring 13 × 10 mm.\r\nAnother specimen laid in June in two successive years. These and other\r\nGeckos live very well in a greenhouse, or in a large glass cage. They\r\nchange colour most adaptively. They hunt preferably at night for insects,\r\nwhich are stalked and then suddenly rushed at. Drops of water are taken by\r\na lapping motion of the tongue. For sleeping-places they selected bits of\r\nhollow bamboo, but these had to be vacated when some tree-frogs crept into\r\nthem for the daytime, and the Geckos took to some curved pieces of bark, on\r\nthe under side of which they slept, with their backs downwards. This is, by\r\nthe way, a favourite position of rest of most Geckos. But _Stenodactylus\r\nguttatus_ of Egypt lies flat on its belly, tucks the fore-feet under and\r\ninwards like a cat, rests the head upon them, and stretches the hind-limbs\r\nout backwards. The little Geckos are rather intelligent. They take no\r\nnotice of a finger put against the other side of the glass to which they\r\nhappen to cling; but {510}when the hand is put inside their cage and\r\napproaches them too near, they dart off suddenly. When driven into a corner\r\nthey wriggle and wag their tails, or even raise the latter, perhaps as an\r\ninvitation to grasp it, in which case it would of course break off. When\r\ncaught, they emit feeble sounds, and attempt to bite with the mouth widely\r\nopen. During the moulting, which takes place at least twice a year, in the\r\nspring and in the autumn, the skin peels off in flakes; if, as happens\r\nsometimes, the skin upon the lamellae is not stripped off neatly, these\r\nrefuse to act, and the creature cannot climb until all the old skin has\r\nbeen rubbed off.\r\n\r\nIn their native haunts they are very regular in their habits. Favourite\r\nresorts of theirs are old olive trees or oak trees, the rough and cracked\r\nbark of which affords excellent places for hiding in. Hollow trees are of\r\ncourse preferred. Not a single specimen is seen during the early hours of\r\nthe morning or in the forenoon; but when the sun has become broiling hot,\r\nand our own shadow passes over the stem of a tree, we become aware of\r\nflitting little shadows which jerk over its surface. These are Geckos which\r\nhad been basking, motionless; very dark grey, almost blackish, just like\r\nthe colour of the grey bark upon which the last wet season's moss has been\r\nscorched to a black cinder. It is difficult to espy a Gecko whilst it is\r\nglued on to such a tree. Only the little beady eyes betray it, watching you\r\ncarefully. Nothing appears more easy than to catch that motionless thing.\r\nYou put out your hand and it is gone; like a flash it has moved a foot\r\nhigher up, or down, to the right or to the left, just where you least\r\nexpected it to go, and there it clings on motionless as before. It does not\r\nseem to run; it glides along, dodging over to the other side of the stem\r\nand back again. There is system in its motions, since, taking a last\r\nleisurely look around, it gently disappears in a rent or hole. Towards the\r\nevening, or when the shadows become longer, the Geckos become lively. One\r\nafter another appears on the surface, upon the tree, or at the entrance of\r\nthe cave, and they all move about in their peculiar rushing jerks. Spiders,\r\nflies, mosquitoes, moths, form the principal diet, and the hunting goes on\r\nwell into the night. Where a gecko has been seen once it is sure to\r\nreappear the next day at the same hour. Those which take up their abode\r\ninside a house become almost domesticated. They are strange sights when\r\nhunting for flies, {511}running up and down the papered walls; but we\r\nfairly gasp when they come to the upper corner, calmly bend over, and with\r\nthe next jerk slide along the white-washed ceiling. We are accustomed to\r\nflies performing such feats, but at animals five inches long, supple and\r\nfat, we are inclined to draw the line. However, that is the way of Geckos,\r\nand–be it confessed–the more we ponder over the mechanism of their fingers\r\nand toes, the less we comprehend how such little vacua can support or\r\nsuspend such heavy creatures from a dry and often porous surface.\r\n\r\n_Gecko._–The digits are strongly dilated with undivided lamellae. All,\r\nexcept the pollex and hallux, have a very short compressed terminal phalanx\r\nwith a retractile claw. Males with femoral or pre-anal pores. This Eastern\r\ngenus includes some of the largest of all Geckos.\r\n\r\n_G. stentor_ of the Malay countries reaches a length of 15 inches. _G.\r\nverticillatus_ s. _verus_ s. _guttatus_ ranges from Eastern Bengal to China\r\nand through the Indian archipelago. It grows to about one foot in length.\r\nThe head is large; the back is covered with small granules and about a\r\ndozen rows of large tubercles. The tail, when intact, and the belly are\r\ncovered with scales, those of the tail being arranged in transverse rows,\r\nseveral of which make up distinct rings. The upper parts of the body are\r\ngrey or yellowish with red spots and vermiculations. According to\r\nTheobald[151] it lays about eight hard-shelled white eggs as big as a\r\nmusket-ball, cementing them to trees, rocks, or secluded buildings. The cry\r\nis \"touk-tay,\" several times repeated, and ending in a long-drawn out,\r\ndiminuendo, guttural rumble. This animal does not confine itself to\r\ninsects, but eats young rats also. Dr. Mason has seen it devour smaller\r\nspecies of house-lizards, and Theobald has seen it seize a bat flying round\r\nthe room, and devour it.\r\n\r\nTennent[152] tells the following story about one of these creatures: \"In an\r\nofficer's quarter in the fort of Colombo, a Gecko had been taught to come\r\ndaily to the dinner-table, and always made its appearance along with the\r\ndessert. The family were absent for some months, during which the house\r\nunderwent extensive repairs, the roof having been raised, the walls\r\nstuccoed, and the {512}ceilings whitened. It was naturally surmised that so\r\nlong a suspension of its accustomed habits would have led to the\r\ndisappearance of the little lizard; but on the return of its old friends,\r\nit made its entrance as usual at their first dinner the instant the cloth\r\nwas removed.\"\r\n\r\n_Ptychozoon._–The digits have the same structure as described in the genus\r\n_Gecko_, but they are entirely webbed. The extraordinary feature of\r\n_Ptychozoon_ is the membranous expansions on the sides of the head, body,\r\nlimbs, and tail, which are said to act as parachutes. _P. homalocephalum_,\r\nthe only species, inhabits the Malay Islands and the Malay Peninsula. It\r\nreaches a length of 8 inches. A specimen obtained by F. H. Bauer in Java,\r\nin the month of November, laid two eggs a few days after its capture. One\r\nyoung was hatched in the middle of the following May, and two days later\r\nanother came out of the second egg. The characteristic folds of the skin\r\nwere already clearly discernible.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. EUBLEPHARINAE.–Differing from the true Geckos by their\r\nprocoelous vertebrae and the fusion of the two parietal bones into one. The\r\neyelids are not reduced, but remain functional. This sub-family is\r\nundoubtedly a heterogeneous assembly, as indicated by the very scattered\r\ndistribution of its few species (about seven), in India, West Africa, and\r\nCentral America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.–_Ptychozoon homalocephalum._ × ⅔.]\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 3. UROPLATINAE, composed of a few species of the genus _Uroplates_\r\nin Madagascar. The distinctive characters of {513}these otherwise typical\r\nGeckos are the fusion of the nasal bones into one, the small size of the\r\ninterclavicle, and the non-dilated shape of the clavicles.\r\n\r\nNeither the Eublepharinae nor the Uroplatinae are more nearly related to\r\nother Autosauri than are the other Geckos. They are modifications within\r\nthe sub-order of the Geckones.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 2. LACERTAE.–_Autosauri with procoelous, solid vertebrae, and\r\nwith the ventral portions of the clavicles not dilated._\r\n\r\nCope,[153] discarding outer appearances as deceptive in the classification\r\nof the Lacertae, laid stress upon internal characters, notably the presence\r\nor absence of osteoderms, the formation of the skull, and the structure of\r\nthe tongue. Boulenger[154] has followed and improved upon Cope's\r\narrangement, and has elaborated the classification, which, being used by\r\nhimself in the three volumes of the Catalogue of Lizards in the British\r\nMuseum, has also been followed in the present work, with slight alterations\r\nin the order of treatment of the families. For our present purpose we\r\ndiagnose the families as follows, giving preference to such characters as\r\nare most easily ascertained:–\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF THE FAMILIES OF LACERTAE.\r\n\r\n  Fam. 1.

Cosmopolitan, p. 559.\r\n\r\nThe following five \"families\" are much degraded in conformity with their\r\nusually subterranean life, see p. 496:–\r\n\r\n  Fam. 14. Anelytropidae.   Without limbs.  Body covered with scales.\r\n                              Mexico and Africa, p. 564.\r\n\r\n  Fam. 15. Dibamidae.

Aniellidae.      Without limbs; body covered with scales,\r\n                              without osteoderms. California, p. 564.\r\n\r\n  Fam. 17. Amphisbaenidae.  The body is covered with soft skin, forming\r\n                              numerous rings with mere vestiges of scales.\r\n                              Without limbs, except _Chirotes_ with four-\r\n                              clawed fore-limbs, p. 565.\r\n\r\n  Fam. 18. Pygopodidae.     Snake-shaped, with scales.  Fore-limbs absent,\r\n                              hind-limbs appearing as a pair of scaly\r\n                              flaps. Australia, p. 567.\r\n\r\nThese eighteen \"families\" of the Lacertae fall into four main groups. We\r\nnaturally assume that the presence of osteoderms and of complete cranial\r\narches indicate more archaic conditions than their absence, just as we\r\nconclude that limbless forms have been evolved from creatures with fully\r\ndeveloped limbs. We arrange the four groups with their families as\r\nfollows:–\r\n\r\n  {515}Group I. Zonuridae and Anguidae assume a central position, with\r\n  Iguanidae and Agamidae as two parallel families of highest development.\r\n  Aniellidae as the most degraded forms. Helodermatidae and Lanthanotidae\r\n  as rather primitive and solitary survivals.\r\n\r\n    Agamidae Iguanidae\r\n              |     |\r\n              |    Xenosauridae\r\n              |         |\r\n         Zonuridae–Anguidae–Helodermatidae.\r\n                        |\r\n                        V\r\n                    Aniellidae.\r\n\r\n  Group II. Xantusiidae–Tejidae–Amphisbaenidae.\r\n\r\n  Group III. Scincidae–Gerrhosauridae–Lacertidae.–Here also Anelytropidae\r\n  and perhaps also Dibamidae as degraded Scincoids.\r\n\r\n  Group IV. Varanidae, which are in many respects the most highly developed\r\n  of all.\r\n\r\n    Pygopodidae are of obscure relationship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.–Map showing the distribution of the Agamidae.]\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. AGAMIDAE.–Acrodont, Old-World Lizards, with a broad and short\r\ntongue.  The teeth are usually differentiated into incisors, canines, and\r\nmolars. The orbit is closed posteriorly; the temporal fossa is bridged over\r\nby an arch which is formed chiefly by the squamosal and the well-developed\r\njugal; the postorbital mostly remaining small, and the postfrontal and\r\nsupratemporal bones being either absent or not present as separate\r\nelements. The limbs are well developed. The eye, provided with complete\r\neyelids, is distinctly small and has a round pupil. The skin is devoid of\r\nosteoderms, although large and numerous spines are often present,\r\nespecially on the head and on the tail. The Agamidae, of which about two\r\nhundred species, arranged {516}in about thirty genera, are known, exhibit a\r\ngreat diversity of mostly flat-bodied, terrestrial and more laterally\r\ncompressed, arboreal forms. The majority are insectivorous, a few Agamas\r\nhave a mixed diet, while _Uromastix_ and some others are chiefly, if not\r\nentirely, frugivorous and herbivorous. They are an exclusively Old-World\r\nfamily, avoiding the cooler parts of the Palaearctic sub-region, and also,\r\na very curious fact, Madagascar. The majority live in Australia and in the\r\nIndian and Malay countries, comparatively few in Africa, chiefly the genus\r\n_Agama_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.–_Draco volans._ × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n_Draco_ (\"Flying Dragon\").–The body is much depressed and the sides extend\r\nas a pair of large wing-like membranes, which are supported by five or six\r\nof the much-elongated posterior ribs, and can be folded up like a fan. On\r\nthe throat are three pointed appendages, a short one on either side and a\r\nlong one in the middle. The tail is very long and slender, but not brittle.\r\nAbout twenty species of this extraordinary genus inhabit the various\r\nIndo-Malayan countries; one, _D. dussumieri_, occurs in Madras. _D. volans_\r\nof the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo is about 10 inches long,\r\n5 of which are taken up by the tail. The {517}male has a small nuchal\r\ncrest. The upper parts of this pretty creature have a metallic sheen, with\r\nsmall dark spots and undulating cross-bands upon the rich brown\r\nground-colour. The wings are orange with black markings. The gular sac of\r\nthe male is orange, that of the female is blue.\r\n\r\nThe \"Flying Dragons\" use their wings as parachutes, but their sailing\r\npowers are said to be very moderate. Certainly they do not fly by moving\r\nthe wings, but when at rest upon a branch, amidst the luxurious vegetation\r\nand in the immediate neighbourhood of gorgeously coloured flowers, which\r\npartly conceal them by their likeness, they greatly resemble butterflies,\r\nespecially since they have the habit of opening and folding their pretty\r\nwings.\r\n\r\n_Ceratophora._–This exclusively Ceylonese genus is remarkable for a\r\nflexible, erect, and pointed appendage which arises from the top of the\r\nsnout; it is best developed in the males, vestigial or absent in the\r\nfemales. Gular appendages are absent. The trunk is crestless, slightly\r\ncompressed, and covered with partly keeled scales. The tail is slender and\r\nvery long, about two-thirds of the total length of the animal. The general\r\ncolour is olive-brown, with irregular darker markings and with light\r\nstreaks on the head and thighs. _C. stoddarti_ and _C. tennenti_ are about\r\n10 inches long, the former without, the latter with, little scales upon the\r\nrostral appendage.\r\n\r\n_Lyriocephalus_, with _L. scutatus_ (Fig. 124) of Ceylon as the only\r\nspecies, is remarkable for its Chameleon-like appearance. A splendid case\r\nof convergent evolution, but most improbably of mimicry. The tympanum is\r\nquite hidden. The head is raised into a pair of sharp bony edges. On the\r\ntop of the nose is a thick globular lump, recalling the genus\r\n_Ceratophora_, and also various Malagasy Chameleons. The back and sides are\r\ncovered with very small granular scales, intermixed with several rows of\r\nenlarged scales as in _Chameleo pumilus_, and there is a serrated crest\r\nalong the back from neck to tail. The under parts are covered with large\r\nkeeled scales with sharp points directed backwards, especially on the tail.\r\nThe whole body is laterally compressed. The pollex and the fifth toe are\r\nstrongly opposed to the other digits. The general colour is greenish above,\r\nwhitish below. Total length about one foot.\r\n\r\n_Calotes_, with many species in India and in the Malay Islands, is\r\ndistinguished by a crest on the neck and back. Many of the males have a\r\ngular sac. The tail is extremely long. These lizards are remarkable for\r\ntheir changes of colour.\r\n\r\n{518}[Illustration: FIG. 124.–_Lyriocephalus scutatus._ × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n_C. versicolor_ ranges from Afghanistan through the whole of India to\r\nSouthern China, and attains a length of 14 inches, 11 of which are taken up\r\nby the tail. It possesses no gular sac, but has a well-developed crest. The\r\nwhole body and tail are covered with strongly keeled scales. When the\r\nlizard is irritated, or swallowing its food, the head and neck become\r\nbrilliant red, whilst the usually brownish tint of the body is converted\r\ninto pale yellow. Mr. Annandale has favoured me with the following\r\nobservations on _C. emma_:–\"In the Malay Peninsula the Europeans misname\r\nthis lizard Chameleon. The colour-changes appear to be brought about by\r\nemotions, although the lizard is often darker towards {519}evening than it\r\nis at mid-day. The males are very pugnacious, and change colour as they\r\nfight. At the time of courtship a curious performance is gone through by\r\nthe male, the female remaining concealed in the foliage hard by. He chooses\r\nsome convenient station, such as a banana leaf or the top of a fence, and\r\nadvances slowly towards the female. His colour is then pale yellowish\r\nflesh-colour, with a conspicuous dark spot on each of the gular pouches,\r\nwhich are extended to their utmost. He stands upright, raising the fore\r\npart of the body as high as possible, and nodding his head solemnly up and\r\ndown. As he does so, the mouth is rapidly and repeatedly opened and shut,\r\nbut no sound is emitted. When he is driven away, caught or killed, the dark\r\nspot disappears entirely from the neck. If one male is captured, another\r\ntakes his place within a few hours.\"\r\n\r\n_C. ophiomachus_ of Southern India and Ceylon reaches 2 feet in length, has\r\na fold of skin in front of each shoulder, and is generally known as the\r\n\"blood-sucker\" on account of the red colour displayed during excitement on\r\nthe head and neck.\r\n\r\n_C. mystaceus_, chiefly in Burma and Siam, but also in the Nicobar Islands\r\nand in Ceylon, has a small gular sac and an oblique fold in front of each\r\nshoulder. The specific name seems to refer to the yellowish lips.\r\nMason[155] gives the following vivid account of it:–\r\n\r\n\"This is a very common species in gardens in Toung-ngoo. A pair made their\r\nhome in the mango trees near my study window. The female blundered into the\r\nhouse a few days ago, but I found her a very unattractive animal of a\r\nuniform earth-brown colour. The male, however, is sometimes a beauty. He\r\nmay be often seen jerking his head up and down, with the head, pouch, and\r\nwhole front of the body a glowing ultramarine blue, contrasting beautifully\r\nwith the reddish-brown of the hinder part of the body and tail. From the\r\nnose to the shoulders, below the eye, is a broad white band, which is\r\ninterrupted by three reddish-brown patches, in line with the white band,\r\nbefore reaching the uniform reddish brown of the hinder part of the body.\r\nOccasionally the white band below the eye assumes a brownish colour, and\r\nthe animal appears to have a brown band down each side. He does not always,\r\nhowever, appear in this gay dress. While I am writing, I see him coming\r\ndown the trunk of one of the trees {520}in a very faded garment. His skin\r\nsuggests a bright calico after it has been washed, whose colours succumb to\r\nsoap. The blue is there, but it is no longer the bright blue of yesterday.\r\nIt has changed to a dull light indigo colour. He runs across the grass to\r\nthe foot of another tree, and stops on the bare ground at its base, where\r\nfor a minute or more he bites with great energy at a struggling\r\ngrasshopper, and while thus exercising himself the blue fades out from his\r\nbody altogether, and his whole body takes the colour of the brown earth on\r\nwhich he stands. After tarrying a minute or two he ran up the other tree,\r\nand the dull light blue colour seemed to return to him.\"\r\n\r\n_Agama_ with many species in Africa and Asia; some in South-Eastern Europe.\r\nThe body is somewhat depressed. There is a fold across the throat and a pit\r\non either side; the presence of a gular sac is variable. A dorsal crest is\r\nabsent or but feebly developed. The males have pre-anal pores.\r\n\r\n_A. sanguinolenta._–The body is covered with strongly keeled and pointed\r\nscales. On the sides of the head are a few spine-like scales. The\r\near-opening is partly concealed by a fringe of spinous scales. The males\r\nhave a gular pouch. This is a typical inhabitant of the deserts and steppes\r\nof Turkestan. Zander[156] has observed the habits and many changes of\r\ncolour of this lizard. The usual garb is earthy brown above, with somewhat\r\ndarker and rather indistinct markings. The under parts are whitish.\r\nSometimes the creature changes to dirty white, at other times into blackish\r\nor grey brown. Bluish-red stripes may appear on the sides of the body; blue\r\nlines begin to show on the throat, and ultimately the whole belly,\r\noriginally white, may become ultramarine blue. When the general tone\r\nhappens to be sulphurous yellow, blue often appears on the tail and limbs.\r\nBrick red appears on four longitudinal rows of patches on the sides of the\r\nbody. Sometimes the whole animal assumes a vinous tinge, or it is at first\r\ngreenish before turning into blue. The change begins on the tail and limbs,\r\nextends over the head, and at length reaches the back. Red appears in both\r\nsexes, more frequently in the female; blue almost entirely in the male.\r\nSunlight and warmth only intensify the colours. Adaptive coloration,\r\nbesides the usual sandy garb, has not been observed. The lizards live on\r\nsoil which is baked as hard as bricks, or in {521}cavities of old walls,\r\nprovided there is vegetation. They require vegetable food, besides insects,\r\ngrazing on grass, and having a fondness also for _Mesembryanthemum\r\ncardiforme_. Very large males reach a total length of one foot. They are\r\npugnacious, especially during the time of breeding. The male inflates its\r\ngular sac into the size of a walnut, stands up upon its four limbs, with\r\nits head slightly lowered and turned to one side. Then it darts upon the\r\nfoe which it has been eyeing for some time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.–_Agama stellio._ × ½.]\r\n\r\n_A. stellio_ is the commonest Agama in Egypt, Asia Minor, and in some of\r\nthe Grecian Islands, where the Greeks still call it _korkordilos_, just as\r\nthey did in the time of old Herodotus. The Arabic name is _hardun_. This\r\nlizard is easily recognised by the irregular folds on the neck, which are\r\nbeset with spinous horny scales. It grows to a length of 15 inches. The\r\ngeneral colour is brown, with dark patches on the back. When basking they\r\nbecome almost black; in the breeding season the male assumes red tints on\r\nthe head and neck.\r\n\r\n_Phrynocephalus._–This is a typical Agamoid of the steppes and deserts of\r\nAsia.  The head is short and thick, the ear is {522}hidden. The body is\r\ndepressed, devoid of a dorsal crest; on the throat is a transverse fold but\r\nno sac.\r\n\r\nA. Zander[157] has made interesting observations upon the habits of several\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Ph. helioscopus_ lives on hard stretches of soil, which are absolutely\r\nbare of vegetation, the soil being baked as hard as a paved road. The\r\nlizards live on any insects they can get hold of, chiefly, however, upon\r\nmining ants. When chased they run with short jerks, carrying the tail high\r\nor rolled up.\r\n\r\n_Ph. interscapularis_ occurs, in Transcaspia, on the shifting, loose sand.\r\nIt runs so fast that one scarcely sees anything but its shadow. The tail is\r\nrolled upwards. With short jerks it suddenly changes its direction, stops\r\nbehind a few blades of grass, or in the open, makes a few shaking, wavy\r\nmovements, and covers itself lightly with sand. Shortly after that the top\r\nof the head appears, the grains of sand rolling off between the strong\r\nsupraciliary ridges, and the little creature, only about 3 inches long,\r\npeeps out of its temporary hiding-place.\r\n\r\n_Ph. mystaceus_, which inhabits Transcaspia and parts of Southern Russia,\r\noften faces its aggressor, raising itself upon its fore-limbs, curling and\r\nuncurling its tail in its excitement, and holding its mouth widely open.\r\nThe creature, which attains a length of 9 inches, inclusive of the long\r\ntail, then assumes a markedly changed aspect. The flaps of skin at the\r\ncorners of the mouth swell up into a half-moon-shaped transverse plate, the\r\nhinder surface of which is covered by the outer skin, while the front is a\r\ncontinuation of the rosy lining of the mouth, which thereby appears hugely\r\nenlarged. When biting it hangs firmly on to the finger. This frightening\r\nattitude is interesting, since it occurs in a much more developed condition\r\nin the following genus.\r\n\r\n_Chlamydosaurus kingi._–This peculiar Agamoid, which inhabits Queensland\r\nand Northern and North-Western Australia, is easily recognised by the large\r\nfrill-shaped dermal expansion on either side of the neck. The two halves\r\nare confluent on the throat. The whole frill can be erected, and is worked\r\nby the much-elongated arches or horns of the hyoid apparatus, which extend\r\ninto the flaps of skin, somewhat like the ribs of an umbrella. The\r\nspecially modified hyoidean muscles spread out {523}and fold the frill.\r\nWhen this curious creature is pursued it folds the frill and runs in a\r\nsemi-erect position upon its hind-limbs, with its fore-limbs hanging down.\r\nHowever, it cannot keep up this peculiar gait for long, and it then\r\nsuddenly turns to bay, frequently at the root of a tree, which it can climb\r\nwith ease. When standing at bay it spreads out the shield to its full\r\nextent, in the middle of which appears the widely opened mouth, which is\r\nred inside and armed with powerful teeth. Altogether this lizard presents a\r\nformidable aspect, and is an enemy not to be despised, considering that it\r\nis strongly built and grows to nearly 3 feet in length. For a further\r\naccount of the habits and of the mechanism of the frill see De Vis.[158]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.–_Chlamydosaurus kingi._ × ¼.]\r\n\r\n_Physignathus._–This is a water-loving genus, inhabiting well-watered\r\ndistricts with luxuriant vegetation in Australia, Papuasia, Siam, and\r\nCochin China. The body and the very long tail are laterally compressed and\r\nfurnished with a low, serrated crest. _Ph. lesueuri_ of Queensland reaches\r\na length of about 18 inches. The general colour is dark olive above, with\r\ndarker and lighter {524}cross-bands, and with a broad black band reaching\r\nfrom the eye to the shoulder. The under parts are pale olive, with small\r\nblack dots. The throat, although devoid of a special sac, is frequently\r\nbulged out by the hyoid apparatus, as shown in Fig. 127, taken from a\r\nspecimen in the Zoological Gardens in London.\r\n\r\n_Uromastix_ is a typical desert-form, inhabiting the dry and sandy tracts\r\nof North Africa, Arabia, Syria, Persia, and North-Western India. The genus\r\nis easily recognised by the short and thick tail, which is covered with\r\nwhorls of large spinous scales, while the much-depressed body and head are\r\nalmost smooth, being covered with very small scales. The tympanum of the\r\near is quite exposed. The incisors are large, uniting in the adult into one\r\nor two pairs of large cutting teeth, separated from the molars by a\r\ntoothless space. There is a transverse fold on the throat. Pre-anal and\r\nfemoral pores are well developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.–_Physignathus lesueuri._ × ⅓.]\r\n\r\nThese \"Spiny-tailed Lizards\" live chiefly upon vegetable food, leaves,\r\ngrass and fruit, but they vary this diet with insects, at least in\r\ncaptivity, where they become rather partial to meal-worms. They are\r\nabsolutely terrestrial and diurnal, preferring sandy places, where they\r\nbask or rather roast themselves in the sun; for the night, at the approach\r\nof rain, or on dull and chilly days, they retire into their burrows, which\r\nthey dig in {525}the sand or in the hard ground, unless they hide in the\r\ncracks of rocks. They have a regular mania for digging with their strong\r\nlimbs and short, curved claws. Although they love a great amount of heat,\r\nand become stiff when cooled down to about 16° C. = 60 F., they can stand\r\nseveral degrees of dry frost without injury. During the cold season they\r\nhibernate. The spiny tail is used for defence. The lizard lies as a rule in\r\nsuch a position in its hole that the tail blocks the narrow passage; when\r\ntouched with the hand it deals out jerky side-blows with the tail. The bite\r\nis deliberate and very painful.\r\n\r\n_U. hardwicki_ is a native of North-Western India and Beluchistan,\r\noccurring especially in Sindh and Rajputana, for instance near Delhi and\r\nAgra. This species is of a delicate sandy colour, with dark dots or\r\nvermiculations, interspersed, occasionally, with pale blue specks. The\r\nunder parts are whitish on the tail with a greenish hue. A distinctive and\r\nobvious mark is a large blackish patch on the anterior side of the thigh.\r\nTotal length up to one foot.\r\n\r\nI have several times received consignments of the Indian Spiny-tailed\r\nLizard through the kindness of friends, but I must confess that they are\r\nfar less easily kept than one is led to believe from certain exaggerated\r\naccounts. They are lovely, most interesting, and surprisingly tame\r\ncreatures. I received one lot in the month of June. They made burrows in\r\nthe dry soil, basked in the sun and on the grassy sods of their roomy cage,\r\nand showed great curiosity. When approached, they at first scrambled off or\r\nsank down flat, shut their eyes and feigned death. They then opened their\r\ntiny yellow eyes a little, while others peeped out of their retreats to see\r\nif all was safe, or attracted by some noise. Soon they became so tame that\r\nthey crawled over my hand. But the difficulty consisted in feeding them.\r\nThey greedily lapped up drops of water. Their dung consisted of the\r\nindigestible parts of some species of _Equisetum_ or Mare's tail, mixed\r\nwith fragments of beetles and ants. Lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower, grass,\r\nthe flowers of red and white clover, Mare's tail, wheat, rice, and Indian\r\ncorn were offered, but they only took a few blades of grass and the hard\r\nIndian corn, besides meal-worms. This is all the more astonishing since\r\nother specimens are known to partake freely of herbaceous food. None of\r\nthem survived the late autumn, and most of them succumbed to a disease\r\n{526}known as intussusception of the gut. They certainly could not complain\r\nof the want of heat, since the bottom of their cage was kept permanently\r\nwarm by a lamp, and in the autumn they invariably slept in the warmest part\r\nof the soil, avoiding the cool regions which would have given them a chance\r\nof hibernating.\r\n\r\nAnother consignment arrived in the month of February. None of them ate\r\nanything or survived the early summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.–_Uromastix acanthinurus._ × ¼.]\r\n\r\n_U. acanthinurus_ and _U. spinipes_ are common in Algeria, Tunis, and\r\nEgypt, where they prefer sandy and rocky localities. Their Arabic name is\r\n_Dab_. In Algeria they are sometimes called \"lézards des palmiers,\" perhaps\r\nbecause they eat dates, besides berries, grass, and various flowers. Very\r\nlarge specimens attain a length of 18 inches. Like the other species of\r\n_Uromastix_ they have no voice. The African species can change colour to a\r\ngreat extent. At a low temperature they are mostly grey or brownish black\r\nabove, dirty white below. When it is warmer they change to lighter shades\r\nof brown or even to orange yellow and to green, with black or brown specks\r\nand vermiculations. {527}A young specimen of _U. acanthinurus_ has been\r\nobserved to grow within twelve months from 90 to 150 mm. in length.\r\n\r\n_Moloch._–The mouth of this peculiar-looking creature is very small; the\r\nlateral teeth of the upper-jaw are implanted horizontally and directed\r\ninwards. The body is much depressed, and, like the short tail and head, is\r\ncovered with small scales or tubercles intermixed with large spines. _M.\r\nhorridus_, the only species, inhabits the sandy districts of Western and\r\nSouthern Australia. Nothing is known about its habits except that it seems\r\nto live upon ants. Its extremely rough skin is, according to an accidental\r\nobservation by Dr. Willey, highly hygroscopic. He happened to put a live\r\nspecimen into a shallow dish with water, when, to his surprise, the water\r\nwas sucked up as by blotting-paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.–_Moloch horridus._ × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n_Liolepis._–The body is depressed, without a crest, and is covered with\r\nminute granular scales. The tail is long, and has small keeled scales.\r\nThere is a strong transverse gular fold, and a fold along the side of the\r\nbody. The tympanum is distinct. Femoral, but no pre-anal, pores are\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n_L. belli_, the only species, about 18 inches long when full grown, is a\r\nnative of South-Eastern Asia. The general colour is brownish, with pale\r\nblack-edged spots along the back; the sides are marked with black and\r\norange vertical bars; the under parts are orange, variegated with blue.\r\nAnnandale remarks that this is perhaps the commonest lizard on the barren\r\nstretches of sand in Lower Siam, especially near the coast. It is\r\nexceedingly active and timid. Though its colour is brilliant, the green and\r\n{528}grey eye-like spots which ornament its back, and the orange and purple\r\nstripes on its sides, are not conspicuous amidst the natural surroundings,\r\nthe former harmonising with the shadows cast upon the sand by the scanty\r\nvegetation which it supports, and the latter being more or less concealed\r\nby the folds into which the skin that covers the ribs naturally falls. When\r\nthe male is roughly handled and is unable to use its powerful jaws, it\r\nflattens its body in such a way that the stripes become most conspicuous.\r\nThe female is unable to do this with such effect, as her ribs do not seem\r\nto be so mobile and her colours are less bright. _Liolepis_ lives in holes\r\nin the ground, which often go down vertically for more than 2 feet before\r\nthere is a bend in their course. Each burrow generally contains a pair of\r\nthese lizards, which, according to the natives, are strictly monogamous.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. IGUANIDAE.–Pleurodont lizards with a short and thick,\r\nnon-protractile tongue; almost entirely American, with the remarkable\r\nexception of two genera, _Hoplurus_ and _Chalarodon_ in Madagascar, and\r\none, _Brachylophus_, in the Fiji Islands. Most of the Iguanidae are\r\ninsectivorous, but some of the most striking forms are herbivorous, e.g.\r\n_Iguana_, _Amblyrhynchus_, and _Basiliscus_. In their general structure the\r\nIguanidae closely resemble the Agamidae, from which they differ chiefly by\r\nthe pleurodont dentition. The orbit is surrounded by bone, and the temporal\r\nfossa is bridged over by an arch which is formed by the junction of the\r\nsquamosal chiefly with the postorbital, the jugal taking as a rule less\r\nshare in the arch. Dermal ossifications are absent on the body.\r\n\r\nThere are about three hundred different species, which have been grouped\r\ninto about fifty genera, representing arboreal, terrestrial, burrowing,\r\nsemi-aquatic forms, and even one semi-marine species. Their external\r\nappearance varies consequently within wide limits.\r\n\r\n_Anolis_ is distinguished by the partial dilatation on the middle\r\nphalanges, which carry a series of transverse adhesive lamellae. In its\r\ngeneral shape _Anolis_ resembles slenderly built and long-tailed\r\nLacertidae, which it may be said to represent in tropical and sub-tropical\r\nAmerica, inclusive of the West Indian Islands. The males have a large gular\r\nappendage, which can be distended by the hyoid bones. _Anolis_ is an expert\r\nclimber, living in trees, or rushing about on fences or walls of houses in\r\nsearch of insects; {529}most species can change colour to a great extent.\r\nMore than a hundred species are known, of which we mention only one, very\r\ncommon in the Southern United States.\r\n\r\n_A. carolinensis_ of the South-Eastern United States and of Cuba is\r\nbeautiful golden green on the whole upper surface; the gular sac becomes\r\nvermilion when stretched; when flaccid, it is white with occasional red\r\nlines and spots. The under parts are white. In cold weather and in\r\nconfinement this little lizard, which is scarcely 6 inches in length,\r\nappears dark brown, sometimes with a white line along the back. The changes\r\nof colour are very sudden. They are thoroughly arboreal, leaping from leaf\r\nto leaf like Tree-frogs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.–Map showing the distribution of Anguidae,\r\nIguanidae, and Zonuridae.]\r\n\r\nIn _Anolis_, _Polychrus_, _Hoplurus_, _Chalarodon_, _Liosaurus_, and a few\r\nothers, the posterior ribs are much elongated and imbedded in the abdominal\r\nmuscles, often reaching the medioventral line, a feature elsewhere known in\r\nthe Geckos only.\r\n\r\n_Polychrus._–The body is laterally compressed, covered with small scales,\r\nbut devoid of crests. The digits are likewise compressed, with keeled\r\nlamellae on the under surface and with four large scales at the base of\r\neach claw. Both sexes have femoral pores. The male possesses a small gular\r\nsac. A few species in Tropical America.\r\n\r\n_P. marmoratus_ in South America, where it is often called the Chameleon on\r\naccount of its power of changing colour. The tail is nearly three times as\r\nlong as the head and body, and is covered with keeled scales. The general\r\ncolour of this arboreal creature, {530}which reaches a length of 18 inches,\r\nis green, but the hues are very variable, and within a short time the\r\ncreature can change into dull brown, with or without blackish spots and\r\nbands, or with whitish spots and black lines on the head and other parts of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n_Basiliscus_ is remarkable for the high and erectile crests which are\r\ndeveloped on the back and tail of the males. The toes are bordered on the\r\nouter side with small lobes. The limbs are long, the hind-limbs when\r\nstretched forwards reaching the tip of the snout.  Several species in\r\nCentral America and the adjoining countries to the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.–_Basiliscus americanus_ (male). × ¼.]\r\n\r\n_B. americanus_ reaches the considerable length of nearly 3 feet. The male\r\nhas a crest on the top of the head, and this is produced backwards into a\r\nleathery lobe. The back is adorned with a very high crest; the folds and\r\ndark-coloured marks in which give, in the accompanying illustration, the\r\nimpression that the crest is supported by spines. The long tail carries a\r\nsimilar crest. The general colour of the \"Basilisc\" is green and brown with\r\ndark cross-bars on the back. The crest of the male is said to be red. These\r\ncreatures are very common amidst the {531}luxuriant vegetation on the banks\r\nof the rivers of the Tierra Caliente of Mexico and in Guatemala. They lie\r\nupon the branches of trees, preferring those which overhang the water, into\r\nwhich they plunge at the slightest alarm. The high crests, being restricted\r\nto the male sex, are not essential to their swimming; they propel\r\nthemselves by rapid strokes of the fore-limbs, letting the long rudder-like\r\ntail drag behind. The eggs, measuring 20 by 13 mm., are laid in April or\r\nMay, and are hidden in a hole at the base of a tree. About one dozen make a\r\nset, and they are said to be hatched within a very short time. Owing to\r\ntheir being strictly herbivorous, these pretty and striking-looking\r\ncreatures do not endure captivity in Europe, unless indeed their particular\r\nfood can be procured.\r\n\r\n_Iguana._–The body and tail are laterally compressed and are covered with\r\nvery small scales, while those on the top of the head are large. The neck\r\nand back carry a high crest, which is composed of separate, laterally\r\ncompressed, soft spines. A similar but lower crest borders the anterior\r\nedge of the large gular sac, which is not dilatable. The lateral teeth are\r\nremarkable for their finely serrated or denticulated anterior and posterior\r\nedges. Both sexes have long rows of femoral pores. Only two species in\r\nTropical America, absolutely herbivorous. Their delicate flesh is much\r\nesteemed as food.\r\n\r\n_I. tuberculata_ (Fig. 132), of South and Central America and the West\r\nIndies, reaches a length of 5 to 6 feet. The general colour of the upper\r\nparts is a mixture of green and blackish, frequently speckled with white or\r\nyellow, and there is usually a pale band in front of each arm. The flanks\r\nare marked with dark, light-edged bars. The under parts are pale greenish\r\nor whitish. The Iguanas live in the trees, and when there is danger they\r\njump into the water whatever the height of the tree, coming down with\r\nviolence. In going up some of the narrow, unfrequented creeks in the\r\nMosquito country, according to Napier Bell,[159] the voyager often\r\nencounters quite a shower of falling Iguanas, and runs some risk of getting\r\nhis neck broken. Large specimens, 6 feet long, weigh perhaps 30 lbs. They\r\nburrow deep horizontal holes in the sloping side of a bank. About two dozen\r\neggs, nearly 2 inches long, are laid in a hole, where they are hatched in\r\nthe month of May.\r\n\r\n{532}Iguanas are often brought to the markets, either lashed lengthwise to\r\na branch of the tree on which the specimen happened to be surprised, or\r\ntied up with the long tendons of their own toes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.–_Iguana tuberculata._ × ⅕.]\r\n\r\n_Metopoceros cornutus_ of Hayti is closely allied to _Iguana_, but the male\r\nhas three conical horn-like scales on its head. The general colour of the\r\nwhole animal, which grows to more than one yard in length, is dull black.\r\n\r\nThe following two genera, each containing one species only, are restricted\r\nto the Galapagos Islands. Darwin[160] gives a long and vividly written\r\naccount of their habits.\r\n\r\n_Conolophus subcristatus._–Fully grown specimens are a yard long. Their\r\nshape is stout, the head and fore part of the body appearing especially\r\nheavy. The head is covered, or rather paved, with large cobble-stone-like\r\nscales. On the neck is a low crest of recurved spines, while the median\r\nline of the back appears simply serrated. All the teeth are trilobate. A\r\ngular sac is absent. The coloration is striking. The head is lemon-yellow;\r\n{533}the back is red, merging into dark brown on the flanks. The belly is\r\ndark yellow with a tinge of reddish brown.\r\n\r\nThis lizard was found by Darwin on some of the Galapagos Islands. On James'\r\nIsland it was so common that the party found it difficult to pitch their\r\ntent, on account of the ground being undermined by the many burrows of the\r\nreptiles. They feed during the daytime upon the succulent cactus and the\r\nleaves of various trees. The perfectly harmless creatures are, or were,\r\neaten by the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n_Amblyrhynchus cristatus_ is closely allied to _Conolophus_, of which it\r\nmay be said to be an aquatic modification. The top of the blunt head is\r\ncovered with low, conical, broad-based scales. Over the neck, back, and\r\ntail extends a continuous crest of low, recurved, spiny scales. All the\r\nteeth are trilobate. The body and even more so the tail are laterally\r\ncompressed. The general colour is dark brown above, paler and inclining to\r\nwhitish below. Younger specimens have pale grey spots and blackish\r\ncross-bands on the back and sides. Total length up to 4 feet. The\r\nremarkable feature of this Iguanoid is its semi-marine life. It inhabits\r\nthe rocky and sandy strips of coast of most of the Galapagos Islands,\r\nfeeding upon certain kinds of algae, which it has to dive for, since these\r\nplants grow below tide-marks.\r\n\r\n_Phrynosoma_ (\"Horned Toads\").–The body of these little creatures is much\r\nflattened and broadened, devoid of a dorsal crest, but covered with larger\r\nand smaller, strongly keeled scales. The head is bordered posteriorly by\r\nconspicuous osseous spines. The under parts are covered with small, very\r\nregular scales. Both sexes have a long row of pores on the under surface of\r\nthe thighs. The general colour of the upper parts is a mixture of yellow,\r\ngrey, brown, and black, the larger spiny scales causing the animal to look\r\nas if it were sprinkled with the dried husks of seeds, for instance those\r\nof Buckwheat. The object is concealment, by close adaptation to the arid,\r\nsandy localities which are the home of \"Horned Toads.\" About one dozen\r\nspecies inhabit the western half of the United States and Central America.\r\nAll the species are viviparous, almost the only instance among Iguanidae.\r\n\r\n_Ph. cornutum_ has five spikes on each side of the head: one postorbital,\r\nthree temporal, and one occipital, the latter being by far the largest. The\r\nsides of the lower jaw project in the shape {534}of prominent ledges, and\r\nare protected by a series of small spines. The ventral scales are keeled.\r\nThe under parts are yellowish, frequently with a few brown spots. This\r\nspecies, which grows to a length of 5 inches, ranges from Illinois through\r\nKansas and Texas to Northern Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.–_Phrynosoma cornutum_ (\"Horned Toad\"). × 1.]\r\n\r\n_Ph. coronatum_, an inhabitant of California, has an additional smaller\r\nspine between the two large occipitals. The scales of the belly are quite\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nThese peculiar-looking and interesting creatures recall some of the extinct\r\nDinosaurs in the curious configuration of their head: small miniatures\r\nindeed. In order to be kept in good health, and to be observed properly,\r\nthey require, above all, warmth, sunshine to bask in, sand to burrow in,\r\nand proper food. The latter consists of all kinds of small insects, the\r\nnecessary variety of which is best procured by making sweepings with a\r\nbutterfly-net in a meadow. They take green-flies, house-flies, ants, smooth\r\ncaterpillars, small moths, meal-worms, wood-lice, etc. The food is snapped\r\nup very quickly by a flash of the tongue, which can be turned out, almost\r\nlike that of a frog, but only to the extent of half an inch. Water in the\r\nshape of dew, or drops, is absolutely necessary. When in good condition,\r\nthey defaecate regularly every alternate day.\r\n\r\n{535}[Illustration: FIG. 134.–_Phrynosoma coronatum_ (\"Horned Toad\"). × 1.]\r\n\r\nThey love to bask in the broiling sun, heating themselves well through; and\r\nin the afternoon, long before sunset, when the sand is warmed up to 40° C.,\r\nor fever-heat, they prepare to go to bed. For this they select a dry and\r\nsoft spot, and within a few minutes manage to dig themselves in flat,\r\nliterally sinking into the sand by pushing themselves forwards, and by\r\nshovelling the sand upon their backs with peculiar motions of the fringed\r\nsides of their flat bodies. Sometimes the spines of the head remain\r\nsticking out, looking like dry thorns scattered over the sand. To prevent\r\nthe latter from getting into the nostrils, these are provided with\r\nclosely-fitting valves. Thus they remain concealed during the night, and\r\nnot until the sun is well up do they leave their hiding-place, first\r\npeeping out, and then raising their head and neck, letting the sand roll\r\noff between the spines. Still half concealed, the back covered with little\r\npebbles, seeds, or bits of dry leaves, they wait for a long time before\r\nthey feel lively enough to sally forth. Although mostly slow and deliberate\r\nin their movements, stalking about with arched back, and raised upon the\r\nfore-limbs, they can run fast enough for a few yards before they stop again\r\nand nod in a ridiculous way. When they see themselves observed, they shut\r\ntheir eyes and slowly sink {536}down. On cool and dull days they do not\r\nappear at all, and during part of the cooler season they require artificial\r\nheat until they are ready to hibernate. Unless they are allowed to\r\nhibernate, they will keep on feeding through the winter, but in that case\r\nare sure to die in the following spring.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. XENOSAURIDAE, with _Xenosaurus grandis_ in Southern Mexico as the\r\nsole species, seems to connect the Iguanidae with the Anguidae. According\r\nto Boulenger, its affinity to the former is shown by the T-shaped\r\ninterclavicle, the absence of symmetrical bony shields on the head and of\r\nosteodermal plates on the body. Affinity to the Anguidae is indicated first\r\nby the short tongue, which has a narrow, feebly incised, retractile\r\nanterior part, covered with flat papillae; secondly, by the teeth, which,\r\ninstead of being hollow at the base, are solid; lastly, by the palatine\r\nbones, which are widely separated.\r\n\r\n_X. grandis_, scarcely one foot in length. The body is depressed, covered\r\nabove with minute granules and tubercles, below with smooth scales. A\r\ndistinct fold of skin extends from the axilla to the groin, recalling the\r\nmore strongly developed lateral fold of some of the Anguidae.\r\n\r\nFAM. 4. ZONURIDAE.–This family, comprising four genera with about one dozen\r\nspecies in South and Tropical Africa, and in Madagascar, likewise seems to\r\nconnect Iguanidae and Anguidae. It is distinguished from the former by\r\ndermal ossifications, which roof over the supratemporal fossa; from the\r\nlatter by the tongue, the hollow teeth, and, in _Zonurus_ at least, by the\r\noccurrence of dermal ossifications on the trunk and tail. The tongue is\r\nshort, villose, scarcely protractile, entire, or but feebly nicked at the\r\ntip. The Zonuridae may therefore be defined as _pleurodont African lizards\r\nwith a short tongue, and with a bony roof to the supratemporal fossae_.\r\n\r\n_Zonurus._–The whole head, back, and tail are covered with bony scales, the\r\nhorny covering of which forms very sharp spikes, especially on the tail.\r\nThe body is depressed. The ear-opening is large. South Africa, in dry and\r\nrocky localities; one species, _Z. tropidosternum_, in Madagascar.\r\n\r\n_Z. giganteus_ s. _derbianus_, with strong spikes on the occiput, neck, and\r\ntail. General colour yellowish brown. Total length about 15 inches.\r\n\r\n_Chamaesaura_ of South Africa closely approaches the {537}Anguidae by its\r\nsnake-shaped body, extremely long tail, and vestigial limbs. In _Ch. aenea_\r\nboth pairs of limbs are still present and pentadactyle, but are very small;\r\nin _Ch. anguina_ the limbs are reduced to little styliform stumps; and in\r\n_Ch. macrolepis_ they are altogether absent. The scales of the body and\r\ntail are strongly keeled and imbricating, but are devoid of dermal\r\nossifications. Total length up to 2 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.–_Zonurus giganteus._ × ¼.]\r\n\r\nFAM. 5. ANGUIDAE.–Pleurodont lizards with osteoderms, and with the tongue\r\ncomposed of two distinct portions, of which the anterior is thin,\r\nemarginate, extensible, and retractile into the posterior thicker portion.\r\nThe supratemporal fossa is roofed in by dermal bones. The whole body is\r\nprotected by bony plates underlying the imbricating scales. The teeth vary\r\nmuch in shape, but they are always solid, the new teeth not growing into\r\nthe base of the old ones, but between them. The limbs are in a very\r\nunstable condition, there being in the family a general tendency to reduce\r\nand lose the limbs. The shoulder- and pelvic-girdle however remain,\r\nalthough sometimes merely vestigial. The tail is long, very brittle, and\r\neasily reproduced. All the Anguidae are strictly terrestrial, and live on\r\nanimal diet. {538}Some _Anguis_, at least, are viviparous. The distribution\r\nof the seven genera, with some forty species, is very scattered. The\r\nmajority, chiefly _Gerrhonotus_, inhabit Central America, a few occur\r\nfarther north and south–two, _Anguis fragilis_ and _Pseudopus pallasi_, in\r\nEurope, and one in the Himalayas and in Burmah.\r\n\r\n_Gerrhonotus_ has a pair of deep longitudinal folds, each of which extends\r\nfrom the region of the neck along the side of the body towards the tail.\r\nThe four limbs are well developed and pentadactyle. The teeth are conical.\r\nMany species, mostly in Central America. _G. coeruleus_ has the widest\r\nrange, extending from Costa Rica to Vancouver. It is also one of the\r\nlargest species, reaching a length of more than one foot. The tail is\r\nnearly twice as long as the rest of the body. General colour above brown\r\nwith blackish bars and spots, especially on the more yellowish flanks;\r\nunder parts whitish with a greenish tinge, often with brown spots arranged\r\nin longitudinal rows.\r\n\r\n_Ophisaurus_ s. _Pseudopus_ is closely allied to the previous genus, being\r\npossessed of the same kind of deep lateral folds; the limbs are, however,\r\nreduced to a pair of tiny spikes, half concealed at the sides of the anal\r\ncleft. The teeth are conical, and in the adult have somewhat flattened\r\ncrowns. The body and tail are very long and snake-like, but the head is\r\nthat of a typical Lizard.\r\n\r\n_O. apus_ s. _Pseudopus pallasi_, the Glass-Snake of the Balkan Peninsula,\r\nSouth Russia, Asia Minor, and Morocco, grows to more than one yard in\r\nlength, of which about two-thirds belong to the tail. The general colour is\r\nbrown above, paler below. Young specimens are olive-grey with dark brown\r\ncross-bands on the back. _O. gracilis_ inhabits the Eastern Himalayas and\r\nBurmah, the others live in North America.\r\n\r\nThe \"Glass-Snake\" inhabits bushy localities, where it can hide under the\r\nfallen leaves and in the sand; it cannot climb, and avoids the water. Its\r\nmovements resemble those of a snake, but are far less graceful, owing to\r\nthe stiff armour in which the whole body is encased. The food consists\r\nchiefly of snails, the shells of which are crushed, and of mice, but\r\nnothing comes amiss which can be mastered, namely insects, worms, small\r\nlizards, young birds, and vipers. The prey, when caught, is rapidly twisted\r\nround and round, or shaken until it is giddy or stunned, whereupon the\r\nGlass-Snake proceeds to chew it with its powerful jaws, and then to swallow\r\nit in pieces. {539}Although it can bite so well, it never does so when\r\ncaught, but resorts to the much more disagreeable defence of twisting\r\nitself around one's hand and arm, and besmearing them with its disgustingly\r\nstinking excrements. Those who have observed Glass-snakes praise their\r\ntameness, and the intelligent way in which they hunt about in search of\r\ntheir food. They lay eggs under moss and leaves, and the young seem to\r\nrequire many years to grow up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.–_Anguis fragilis_ (the Slow-worm). × ½.]\r\n\r\n_Anguis_, with only one species, _A. fragilis_, the \"Slow-worm\" or\r\n\"Blind-worm,\" is devoid of a lateral fold. Limbs are entirely absent. The\r\nwhole body is covered with smooth roundish scales, with a substratum of\r\ndermal ossifications. The teeth are curved backwards, fang-shaped, and have\r\na very faint longitudinal groove on their anterior surface. The ear-opening\r\nis very minute, more or less hidden by surrounding scales. The eyes are\r\nperfectly well developed, provided with movable lids, and it does not speak\r\nwell for the power of observation of most people that this creature should\r\ngenerally be known as the \"Blind-worm.\" The whole skin is shiny, metallic,\r\nquite smooth, brown above, blackish below. But the coloration is subject to\r\nmuch individual variation. Old specimens are sometimes adorned with blue\r\nspecks. The very young are exquisitely beautiful, the upper surface being\r\nsilvery white, with a median and two more lateral lines of deep black; the\r\nunder parts are black. The iris is yellowish red. Very large specimens\r\nmeasure more than one {540}foot in length, more than half of which belongs\r\nto the tail. One in the British Museum is 425 mm. = 17 inches long.\r\n\r\nThe Slow-worm is viviparous, _i.e._ the young are fully developed, and\r\nburst the transparent, soft, yellowish eggs immediately after these are\r\nlaid. This takes place in the months of August or September, about one\r\ndozen making a litter. The little creatures are at first about one inch and\r\na half long, and as thin as an ordinary match. They eat the smallest of\r\nspiders and delicate insects; later on earth-worms, which they bite into\r\nand then suck out before devouring them. When six weeks old and well fed\r\nthey are about 3 inches long, but it is at least four or five years before\r\nthey are mature. The little ones carefully avoid the hot sunshine, and the\r\nadults are likewise rather partial to the shade, although strictly diurnal.\r\nTheir chief food consists of earth-worms and slugs. For the night they\r\nretire under moss, leaves, stones, or into the ground. In the autumn the\r\nSlow-worms dig passages or burrows, which often serve as the\r\nwinter-quarters of many specimens, as if there were no other place\r\navailable, or rather as if the spot selected were by far the best with\r\nregard to safety, dryness, and warmth.\r\n\r\nFAM. 6. HELODERMATIDAE.–Pleurodont, _poisonous_ lizards of North America.\r\nThe teeth are fang-like, recurved, with slightly swollen bases, rather\r\nloosely attached to the inner edge of the jaws. Each tooth has a groove on\r\nits anterior and posterior surface, and a series of labial glands which\r\nsecrete the poison open near the bases of the teeth of the lower jaw. The\r\nskull has strong postorbital but no postfronto-squamosal arches. The pre-\r\nand post-frontals are in contact, separating the frontal from the orbit;\r\nthe premaxillaries are fused into one; the nasals and frontals remain\r\nseparate. The limbs are short, but strong and well developed. The tongue is\r\nvillose, with an anterior smooth portion, which is bifid and protractile,\r\nresembling the tongue of the Anguidae and of _Aniella_. The skin of the\r\nupper surface is granular, with many irregular bony tubercles, which give\r\nit an ugly warty look. The under parts are covered with flat scales.[161]\r\n\r\n_Heloderma_, the only genus, with _H. horridum_ in Mexico and _H.\r\nsuspectum_ in New Mexico and Arizona, reaches about 2 feet {541}in length.\r\nThe animal, stout, depressed, thick-tailed, looks rather repulsive when it\r\nsquats down in its usual lethargic way. The whole skin is blackish brown\r\nand yellow or orange, these two \"warning\" colours being distributed\r\nunevenly, except on the thick, peculiarly-shaped tail, where they are\r\narranged in alternate rings. The specific differences are rather imaginary.\r\nThe New Mexican form is supposed to be more orange and yellow than black,\r\nwith a somewhat smoother skin and with shorter toes and tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.–_Heloderma suspectum_ (the Gila Monster). × ⅕.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Gila Monster\" inhabits dry localities, spends most of the daytime in\r\nconcealment between the roots of trees, and crawls about in the evening in\r\nsearch of worms, centipedes, frogs, and the eggs of large lizards. Frogs\r\nare probably paralysed or killed by the bite which, although not so\r\ndangerous as that of poisonous snakes, is effective enough to produce\r\nsevere symptoms even on man, and a few cases of death of people who had\r\nbeen bitten are on record. In captivity they are very partial to eggs,\r\nwhich they break and then lap up. During the dry and hot season they\r\naestivate.\r\n\r\nFAM. 7. LANTHANOTIDAE.–_Lanthanotus borneensis_, of which only two\r\nspecimens are known, one in the Vienna Museum, the {542}other in the\r\nSarawak Museum, was described by Steindachner as the type of a distinct\r\nfamily, near the Helodermatidae. Boulenger,[162] after examination of the\r\nSarawak specimen by means of a sciagraph, has come to the conclusion \"that\r\nthe affinity of _Lanthanotus_ to the Helodermatidae is fully confirmed.\"\r\nThe teeth of _Lanthanotus_ show, however, no traces of grooves;\r\npoison-glands are probably absent, and there are no osteoderms. The skin is\r\ncovered with wart-like tubercles, each with a horny, peeled scale. The eyes\r\nare very small, the ears are concealed. The general colour is reddish brown\r\nabove, yellowish, with brownish bands, below. Total length about one foot,\r\na little more than half of which belongs to the roundish tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.–A, Ventral, B, dorsal view of the skull of\r\n_Varanus griseus_. × 1. _B.O_, Basi-occipital; _B.S_, basisphenoid; _Col_,\r\ncolumella auris or stapedial rod; _E.P_, ectopterygoid; _Fr_, frontal;\r\n_Jug_, jugal; _Lac_, lacrymal; _N_, nasals; _Pal_, palatine; _Par_,\r\nparietals; _Pr.f_, prefrontal; _Pt.f_, postfrontal, fused with postorbital;\r\n_Ptg_, pterygoid (endopterygoid); _Q_, quadrate; _Tb_, turbinal; _Vo_,\r\nvomer.]\r\n\r\nFAM. 8. VARANIDAE.–_Pleurodont Old-World Lizards, with a long, deeply bifid\r\nand protractile smooth tongue._ They reach a large size, and the neck is\r\nrelatively much longer than that of other lizards. The limbs are well\r\ndeveloped. The skin is {543}covered with very small juxtaposed scales and\r\ntubercles above, while the ventral scales are squarish and arranged in\r\ntransverse rows. Osteoderms are entirely absent. The tail is very long,\r\noften laterally compressed. The teeth are large and pointed, dilated at the\r\nbase. The premaxilla is unpaired and dorsally extends backwards to the\r\nlikewise unpaired nasal. There is a pair of small supra-orbital bones,\r\neasily lost during maceration. The orbit is open behind, the jugal being\r\nshort and not meeting the postfrontal; the postorbital forms a slender arch\r\nwith the supratemporal. The vomers are long and diverge posteriorly. The\r\npalatines, pterygoids, and ectopterygoids enclose on either side an oval\r\ninfra-orbital foramen. The Varanidae contain only one genus, _Varanus_,\r\nwith nearly thirty species in Africa, Southern Asia, and Australia, but not\r\nin Madagascar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.–Map showing the distribution of the Varanidae.]\r\n\r\n_Varanus._–The name of \"Monitor\" bestowed upon these creatures has a\r\ncurious origin, owing to a ridiculous etymological mistake. The Arabic term\r\nfor Lizard is \"Ouaran\"; this has been wrongly taken to mean warning lizard,\r\nhence the Latin _Monitor_, one of the many synonyms of this genus, e.g.\r\n_Hydrosaurus_ and _Psammosaurus_. Many of the \"Monitors\" are semi-aquatic,\r\nothers inhabit dry, sandy districts, while others are at home in\r\nwell-wooded localities. They are all rapacious, taking whatever animals\r\nthey can master according to their size, which in some species amounts to 6\r\nor 7 feet.\r\n\r\n_V. niloticus_ inhabits the whole of Africa, except the north-western part.\r\nIt reaches a length of more than 5 feet. The colour of the adult is\r\nbrownish or greenish grey above, with darker reticulations and yellowish\r\nocellated spots on the back and limbs. The under parts are yellowish with\r\nblackish cross-bands. The ground-colour of the young is black above with\r\nyellow lines on the head and neck, and with yellow spots on the back and\r\nlimbs; the tail has black and yellow bars.\r\n\r\n_V. salvator_ ranges from Nepal to Ceylon, Cape York, and {544}Southern\r\nChina, inclusive of the Malay Islands and the Philippines. This is the\r\nlargest species, specimens of 7 feet in length being on record. The general\r\ncolour is dark brown or blackish above, with yellow spots or ocelli. The\r\nsnout and chin have transverse black lines on a lighter ground. A black\r\nband, bordered with yellow, extends from the eye along the side of the\r\nneck. The under parts are yellow.\r\n\r\nMr. Annandale has favoured me with the following observations:–\"_Varanus\r\nsalvator_ is common in Lower Siam, where it is equally at home on land, in\r\nwater, and among the branches of trees. The eggs are laid in hollow\r\ntree-trunks. When in the water the lizard swims beneath the surface, the\r\nlegs being closely applied to the sides, and the tail functioning both as\r\noar and as rudder. Their food is very varied. In the states of Patalung and\r\nSingora, in which the Siamese practise a form of tree-burial, these great\r\nlizards are accused, probably with justice, of eating the flesh of the\r\ncorpses in the aërial coffins. I have disturbed a large Monitor devouring\r\nthe body of one of its own species, which had evidently been dead for some\r\ndays. Another, which was chased by some men, dropped from its mouth a small\r\nflying squirrel (_Sciuropterus_); a third, which I dissected, had lately\r\nswallowed a small tortoise, the hard shell of which had been broken into\r\ninnumerable fragments. The stomachs of several others contained nothing but\r\ndung-beetles, for which Varanus may often be seen hunting, turning over the\r\ndung of elephants and buffaloes with its fore-feet. The Malay name of these\r\nlizards is Biawak.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Mason and Theobald[163] all the Varanidae and their eggs are\r\nhighly esteemed for food, and are sought for in hollow trees with the aid\r\nof dogs. If not wanted at once, the wretched creature has its fore-feet\r\nbent over its back, a few of its toes are broken and the sinews drawn out\r\nand tied into a knot, rendering the animal helpless. The Karens, who are\r\nextravagantly fond of the flesh, steal up the tree with a noose at the end\r\nof a bamboo, and often noose them while leaping for the water, or catch\r\nthem in a boat which is brought under the tree. The head, the natives say,\r\nis venomous, and they discard it altogether, but the flesh of the other\r\nparts, which smells most odiously, is deemed preferable to that of fowls.\r\n\r\n{545}Sir J. G. Tennent[164] gives the following account of _V. salvator_:–\r\n\r\n\"The 'Kabara-goya' of the Singhalese is partial to marshy ground, and when\r\ndisturbed upon land will take refuge in the nearest water. From the\r\nsomewhat eruptive appearance of the yellow blotches on its scales, a\r\nclosely allied species, similarly spotted, obtained the name of _Monitor\r\nexanthematicus_, and it is curious that the native appellation of this one,\r\n_Kabara_, is suggestive of the same idea. The Singhalese, on a strictly\r\nhomoeopathic principle, believe that its fat, externally applied, is a cure\r\nfor cutaneous disorders, but that taken inwardly it is poisonous. The\r\nskilfulness of the Singhalese in their preparation of poisons and their\r\naddiction to using them are unfortunately notorious traits in the character\r\nof the rural population. Amongst these preparations the one which above all\r\nothers excites the utmost dread, from the number of murders attributed to\r\nits agency, is the potent _kabara-tel_, a term which Europeans sometimes\r\ncorrupt into _cobra-tel_, implying that the venom is obtained from the\r\nhooded-snake; whereas it professes to be extracted from the Kabara-goya.\r\n\r\n\"In the preparation of this mysterious compound, the unfortunate\r\nKabara-goya is forced to take a painfully prominent part. The receipt, as\r\nwritten down by a Kandyan, was sent to me from Kornegalle by Mr. Morris,\r\nthe civil officer of that district; and in dramatic arrangement it far\r\noutdoes the cauldron of Macbeth's witches. The ingredients are extracted\r\nfrom venomous snakes by making incisions in the head of these reptiles and\r\nsuspending them over a basin to collect the poison as it flows. To this,\r\narsenic and other drugs are added, and the whole is boiled in a human\r\nskull, with the aid of three Kabara-goyas, which are tied on three sides of\r\nthe fire, with their heads directed towards it, and tormented by whips to\r\nmake them hiss so that the fire may blaze. The froth from their lips is\r\nthen added to the boiling mixture, and so soon as an oily scum rises to the\r\nsurface, the kabara-tel is complete. Before commencing the operation of\r\npreparing the poison, a cock has to be sacrificed to the demons.\r\n\r\n\"This ugly lizard is itself regarded with such aversion by the Singhalese\r\nthat if one enter a house or walk over the roof, it is regarded as an omen\r\nof ill-fortune, sickness, or death; and in {546}order to avert the evil, a\r\npriest is employed to go through a rhythmical incantation.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Robinson, renowned as a hunter of tigers on foot in the old days of\r\nmuzzle-loading rifles, has told me the following unique use to which these\r\nlarge lizards are put by ingenious thieves in India. In order to be able to\r\nget over a wall too high for climbing without assistance, the thief\r\nprovides himself with a strong lizard, ties a rope round its waist and lets\r\nthe animal go, when it at once scales the mud wall by its strong and sharp\r\nclaws, and jumps down on the other side. The weight of the lizard, which,\r\nmoreover, holds vigorously on to the ground, and the friction of the rope\r\non the top of the wall, are sufficient to help the man over!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.–_Varanus salvator_ swallowing a Fowl's egg. × ⅛.]\r\n\r\nIt is a sight, never failing in its attraction to the visitors of the\r\nZoological Gardens in London, to see one of the big Monitors fed with an\r\negg. The lizard knows the treat well that is in store for it. It raises\r\nitself up high in expectation, then examines the egg with the long tongue,\r\ntakes it up gingerly and swallows it entire, crushing it by the contraction\r\nof the muscles of its gullet. On one occasion it was given a rotten egg\r\nwhich burst in its mouth, and the lizard refused for a long time to take\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n_V. gouldi_ is common in Australia and in New Guinea. It reaches a length\r\nof about 4 feet. Its colour is brown above {547}with yellow spots on the\r\nback and limbs, and with yellow rings on the tail. Two yellow streaks\r\nseparated by a black band extend from the temples along the side of the\r\nneck. The under parts are yellowish, sometimes with black spots.\r\n\r\nFAM. 9. XANTUSIIDAE.–Three Californian, or West-Indian genera, with less\r\nthan half-a-dozen species. _Pleurodont with a short tongue and with the\r\nsupratemporal fossa roofed over by bone._ The tongue is scarcely\r\nextensible, with oblique overlapping folds which converge towards the\r\nmedian line, and with scale-like imbricate papillae towards the tip. The\r\nskull possesses complete postorbital and postfronto-squamosal arches, the\r\nlatter meeting the parietals and roofing over the supratemporal fossa. The\r\npalatines are in contact with each other, and there are no infra-orbital\r\nfossae. There are no osteoderms; the body is covered above with small\r\ngranular scales, below with larger scales. The eyes are devoid of movable\r\nlids. The tympanum is exposed. Femoral pores are present. Limbs and tail\r\nwell developed. _Xantusia_ and _Lepidophyma_.\r\n\r\nFAM. 10. TEJIDAE.–American Lizards with a long and bifid tongue. The\r\ngreater portion of the tongue is covered with scale-like papillae; the\r\nanterior forked and pointed ends are smooth. The teeth are solid and\r\nimplanted almost upon the edge of the jaw, being therefore intermediate\r\nbetween the acrodont and pleurodont condition. The shape of the posterior\r\nteeth shows several modifications; they are conical or tricuspid, or\r\nmolar-like in the adult Tejus; in _Dracaena_ they are transformed into\r\nlarge, oval crushers. The palatines are in contact anteriorly. The\r\ninfra-orbital fossae are surrounded by the palatine, pterygoid, and\r\nectopterygoid bones, the maxillary being excluded from the fossa, as in\r\n_Varanus_ (see Fig. 138, p. 542). The skull has no supra-temporal arch.\r\nOsteoderms are absent; the body is covered with small scales, or the skin\r\nis simply granular above; the under surface is covered with larger scales,\r\ngenerally arranged in transverse rows.\r\n\r\nThis large family, which comprises nearly forty genera with more than a\r\nhundred species, exhibits great diversity of form. Some are inhabitants of\r\nforests and are arboreal, while others are strictly terrestrial, preferring\r\nhot and sandy plains, or they dwell below the surface and are transformed\r\ninto almost limbless and blind-worm-shaped creatures. The range of the\r\nfamily extends over the whole of the South American continent, over the\r\nWest {548}Indian Islands, and through Central America into the warmer parts\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n_Tupinambis_ (\"Teju\").–The skin of the back is smooth, covered with small\r\nscales; with large scales on the top of the head. The skin on the neck is\r\ngenerally thrown into two irregular transverse folds. The long and narrow\r\ntongue is capable of being telescoped into a sheath at its base. The\r\nlateral teeth are compressed and tricuspid in the young, but the later\r\ngenerations of teeth have obtuse crowns in the adult. _T. teguixin_ is the\r\nlargest member of the whole family; it reaches a length of a yard, most of\r\nwhich, however, belongs to the tail. The general colour is bluish black,\r\nwith pale or whitish-yellow spots on the back, flanks, and tail, combining\r\ninto more or less transversely arranged bands. The limbs are black, with\r\nmany and tiny yellow dots. The ground-colour of the under parts is reddish\r\nyellow, with irregular black bars. This species inhabits the greater part\r\nof South America, east of the Andes, from Uruguay to the West Indies. _T.\r\nnigropunctatus_ is confined to the Continent, and lacks the dark\r\ncross-bands on the belly, which is uniformly yellowish or speckled with\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.–_Tupinambis nigropunctatus._ × ⅙.]\r\n\r\n{549}The \"Tejus\" frequent forests and plantations, and are carnivorous.\r\nTheir strength and swiftness enable them to catch all kinds of animals,\r\nfrom insects and worms to frogs, snakes, mice, and birds. As they take\r\nchickens and eggs from the farms they are considered noxious, and they are\r\nfrequently hunted down with dogs for the sake of their flesh, which is\r\nregarded as good to eat. They defend themselves with lashing strokes of\r\ntheir long tail and with their powerful jaws. They retire into burrows, and\r\nthey deposit their hard-shelled eggs in the ground. In captivity they can\r\neasily be kept on meat.\r\n\r\n_Dracaena guianensis_ of the Guianas and the basin of the Amazon has the\r\nlateral teeth transformed into regular large molars, with broad and rounded\r\ncrowns. The tail is strongly compressed, with a double, denticulated keel.\r\nIt seems to be semi-aquatic, and, to judge from the teeth, herbivorous.\r\n\r\n_Ameiva_ and _Cnemidophorus_, with many species chiefly in tropical\r\nAmerica, have laterally compressed bi- or tri-cuspid teeth. The skin forms\r\na double fold on the neck, and is covered on the upper surface of the body\r\nwith very small scales; those on the ventral surface are large, and\r\narranged in regular rows. Most of the species are small, under one foot in\r\nlength, and are extremely pretty, very active, timid, and mainly\r\ninsectivorous.\r\n\r\n_C. sexlineatus_ is one of the few species of _Cnemidophorus_ which\r\ninhabits the southern half of North America. Like all its relations it has\r\nthe appearance of an ordinary lizard (_Lacerta_). The head is dark brown. A\r\npurple or brownish band extends over the back and tail, bordered on either\r\nside with three golden-yellow longitudinal lines. The flanks are brown, the\r\nunder parts bluish white. The iris is golden, and the inner margins of the\r\nlids are bordered with a narrow band of bright yellow. This species is a\r\nvery fast runner, and frequents dry and sandy places. Its total length\r\namounts to about 10 inches.\r\n\r\nFAM. 11. LACERTIDAE.–_Pleurodont Old-World Lizards, without osteoderms on\r\nthe body, and with the supratemporal regions roofed over by osteoderms._\r\n\r\nThe limbs are always well developed, and have five fingers and five toes,\r\nalways provided with sharp claws. The skin covering the head forms large\r\nshields, mixed with small scales; most of which, especially the shields,\r\ncontain dermal ossifications. These frequently fuse with the underlying\r\nbones of the top of the skull.\r\n\r\n{550}[Illustration: FIG. 142.–Skull and lower jaw of _Lacerta viridis_. A,\r\nDorsal view; B, ventral view; C, from the left side; D, right half of the\r\nlower jaw, from the inner side, with some of the pleurodont teeth. _E.P_,\r\nEctopterygoid; _F_, _Fr_, frontal; _jug_, jugal; _Lac_, lacrymal; _Max_,\r\nmaxillary; _N_, _Na_, nasal; _N_{1}_, in B, inner narial opening; _Pal_,\r\npalatine; _Par_, parietal; _Pmx_, premaxillary; _Pr.f_, prefrontal; _Pt.f_,\r\npostorbital; _Pt.f_{2}_, postfrontal; _Ptg_, pterygoid; _Q_, quadrate;\r\n_S.ang_, supra-angular; _Sq_, squamosal; _Vo_, vomer.]\r\n\r\nThe latter is always well marked off from the neck. The postorbital arch is\r\ncomplete. The temporal region is completely roofed over by bones dorsally,\r\nchiefly owing to the size of the postfrontal (Fig. 142, _pt.f_{2}_) which\r\nfills the space between the parietal and the squamoso-postorbital bridge,\r\nthus abolishing the supra-temporal fossa. The squamosal is very small,\r\nplaced {551}between the postfrontal (_pt.f_{2}_), the lateral occipital and\r\nthe supratemporal. The large jugal and the quadrate are not connected with\r\neach other. The columella cranii is well developed. The infra-orbital\r\nfossae are surrounded by the palatines, pterygoids, ectopterygoids, and\r\nmaxillaries. The palatines and pterygoids remain separated in the middle\r\nline. The pterygoids frequently carry little teeth. The other teeth are\r\ntypically pleurodont, hollow, slightly curved, and bi- or tri-cuspid.\r\n\r\nThe skin covering the body, the legs, and the tail is devoid of osteoderms.\r\nThe scales on the dorsal surface vary much in size, from large, strongly\r\nkeeled scales to tiny granulations. Those of the ventral surface are large,\r\nbroader than long, and are frequently arranged in regular transverse and\r\nlongitudinal rows. The tail, generally long and pointed, is very brittle.\r\nAll the sense-organs are well developed. The tympanum is exposed. The\r\ntongue is deeply bifurcated, narrow, flat, and covered with scale-like\r\npapillae.\r\n\r\nVarious Lacertidae, especially some of those genera which live and dig in\r\nthe sand, have a transparent disc in the middle of the lower eyelid, so\r\nthat they can see while the eye itself is protected. This is for instance\r\nthe case in some specimens of the Indian and African _Eremias_. In the\r\nIndian genus _Cabrita_ the transparent disc is very large, and in\r\n_Ophiops_, which inhabits sandy stretches from North Africa to India, the\r\nlower eyelid is fused with the rim of the much-reduced upper lid, and forms\r\na large transparent window.\r\n\r\nThe Lacertidae or True Lizards comprise nearly twenty genera, with about\r\none hundred species, and are typical of the Old World, being found in\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa, but not in Madagascar nor in the Australian\r\nregion. They are most abundant in Africa. Their northern limit coincides\r\nfairly closely with the limit of the permanently frozen under-ground. This\r\nis indicated in the map (Fig. 143) by the dotted line. All the Lacertidae\r\nlive upon animal food, chiefly insects, and after them worms and snails;\r\nbut the larger lizards take what they can master, frequently other lizards,\r\nand even younger members of their own kind. Many of them love sugar, which\r\nthey lick, and all require water. They are all terrestrial, preferring,\r\naccording to their kind, such localities as yield them their particular\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n{552}[Illustration: FIG. 143.–Map showing the distribution of the\r\nLacertidae.]\r\n\r\nSunshine and warmth make a marvellous change in the same individual, which\r\non dull, rainy, or cold days lies in its hole, or shows only sluggish\r\nmovements. Their sense of locality is great, or rather each individual\r\ninhabits one place, of which it knows every nook and corner, cranny, tree,\r\nand bush. It has its favourite hole to sleep in, a stone, the branch of a\r\ntree, or a wall to bask upon, and when disturbed or chased it makes with\r\nunerring swiftness for a safe spot to retire into. The same lizard, when\r\nonce driven away from its own locality, seems to lose all its presence of\r\nmind, flounders about, and is comparatively easily caught. Most lizards are\r\nextremely curious, although shy, and this state of their mind can be made\r\nuse of by those who want to catch them without injury, and above all\r\nwithout getting the animal minus the brittle tail. This safe way of\r\ncatching lizards consists in taking a thin rod with a running noose of\r\nthread at the end, in drawing the latter over the lizard's head, and then\r\nraising it. The little creature does not mind the rod in the least; on the\r\ncontrary, it watches it carefully, and often makes for the thread. The boys\r\nin Southern Italy have improved upon and simplified this mode of catching\r\nlizards by bending the end of a wisp of grass into a noose, and covering\r\nthe latter over with a thin film of saliva. The shiny film, like a\r\nsoap-bubble, is sure to excite the curiosity of the creature. The late\r\nProfessor Eimer[165] refers to this practice {553}as carried out by the\r\nchildren of two thousand years ago, and he sagaciously explains that the\r\nbeautiful statue of the so-called Apollo Sauroctonos represents a boy who\r\nis in the act of noosing the little lizard on the tree.\r\n\r\n_Lacerta._–A row of enlarged scales forms a distinct collar across the\r\nventral half of the neck, in front of the chest. The scales on the back are\r\nmuch smaller than those on the tail, which is long, round, and pointed. The\r\ndigits have smooth, tubercular lamellae on the under surface. Femoral pores\r\nare well marked. This genus, with about twenty species, ranges through\r\nEurope, Northern and Western Asia, and Africa north of the Equator.\r\n\r\n_L. vivipara_, the Common English Lizard, has a very wide range, through\r\nNorthern and Central Europe and Siberia to the Amoor country and the Island\r\nof Saghalien. It occurs throughout Great Britain, even in Ireland, where it\r\nis the only species of reptile, occurring, for instance, in the County of\r\nMeath and in the south-eastern counties, _e.g._ Waterford. It does not\r\noccur south of the Pyrenees or south of the Alps. The supra-ocular and the\r\nsupraciliary scales are in contact with each other, not being separated by\r\na series of little granules. Normally there is a single postnasal and a\r\nsingle anterior loreal shield. The ventral scales are arranged in six or\r\neight longitudinal series, of which the second series on each side from the\r\nmedian ventral line is the largest. The coloration of this species is\r\nsubject to much variation. The general colour of the adult is brown or\r\nreddish above, with small darker and lighter spots; many specimens have a\r\nblackish vertebral streak and a dark lateral band edged with yellow. The\r\nunder parts are orange to red in the male, with conspicuous black spots;\r\nyellow or pale orange in the female, either without or with scanty black\r\nspots. The newly-born specimens are almost black. The males are slightly\r\nsmaller than the females; males of a total length of 6 inches, and females\r\n7 inches long, may be considered rather large specimens.\r\n\r\nThis lizard is, as the specific name implies, viviparous, i.e. the six to\r\ntwelve young burst the eggs immediately after they have been laid;\r\nsometimes the mother has to retard the laying, in which case the young are\r\nborn free. The female does not make a nest, but simply deposits her\r\noffspring on the ground and leaves the young to their fate. For the first\r\nfew days the little ones, which scarcely measure three-quarters of an inch\r\nin {554}length, remain almost motionless between leaves or in cracks of the\r\nground, and they do not take any food. They grow, however, quickly, living\r\nupon the remains of the yolk which has slipped into their body. Their first\r\nfood consists of Aphides and similar tiny insects.\r\n\r\nThe Common Lizard prefers moist localities and is very hardy. It extends\r\nnorthwards to Archangel, and in the Alps it ascends to nearly 10,000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. However, on the approach of the cold season, in\r\nthe month of October, it withdraws into its winter quarters, frequently in\r\ncompany with many of its own kind.\r\n\r\n_L. agilis_, the Sand-Lizard, has nearly the same wide range as _L.\r\nvivipara_, except that it does not go so far north and does not extend\r\neastwards beyond Central Siberia. It is absent in Ireland and Scotland,\r\nwhile in England it is restricted to the southern half.\r\n\r\nThe characters which distinguish the Sand-Lizard from _L. vivipara_ are\r\nfew, although the majority of the specimens of either kind are very\r\ndistinct in their coloration, and _L. agilis_ is strictly oviparous,\r\ndepositing its eggs in the ground, under leaves, in heaps of weeds and\r\nsimilar places. The Sand-Lizard has usually a single postnasal and two\r\nsuperposed anterior loreals, the three shields forming a triangle. The\r\ntemples are covered with flat scales, two or three of which are enlarged\r\nand in contact with the parietals, but there is no tympanic scale.\r\n\r\nThe coloration is subject to much variation, local as well as individual.\r\nAs a rule the Sand-Lizard gives the impression of being striped\r\nlongitudinally, the striation being caused by rows of dark and white spots\r\nand patches along the sides of the back, flanks, and tail. In the male a\r\nmore or less pronounced green, in the female brown and grey are the\r\nprevailing ground-colours. A typically coloured male during the breeding\r\nseason is grass-green on the sides and suffused with green on the yellow\r\nunder parts; the sides are dotted with black, with whitish eye-spots. The\r\nunder parts are spotted with black. The adult female is brown or grey\r\nabove, with large dark brown, white-centred spots, which are arranged in\r\nthree rows on each side. The under parts are cream-coloured, with or\r\nwithout black specks. The young are grey-brown above with white,\r\nblack-edged spots; the under parts are whitish. Total length of the adult\r\nup to 8 inches. {555}The male is a little smaller than the female but has a\r\nrelatively longer tail, a little less than half the total length.\r\n\r\nThe Sand-Lizard is easily kept in captivity, and lives for years if allowed\r\na variety of food and proper places to hibernate in. It pairs in the\r\nspring, in England in May or June; the white, parchment-like eggs,\r\nnumbering five to eight, are hatched in the following July or August.\r\n\r\n_L. viridis_, the Green Lizard, inhabits Southern and Middle Europe and\r\nSouth-Western Asia. The general colour of this beautiful lizard is\r\nemerald-green above, changing into greenish yellow on the flanks and into\r\nyellow on the belly. The throat, especially in the males during the\r\nbreeding season, is blue. The upper parts are frequently speckled with\r\nblack. The young are brown or green above with one or two yellowish lateral\r\nstripes, which persist in some adult females. There are usually two\r\nsuperposed postnasal shields. The semilunar collar on the neck is well\r\npronounced, and there is usually a distinct gular fold. The tail is often\r\nvery long, especially in the males, sometimes nearly three-quarters of the\r\ntotal length, which in very large males reaches 16 or 17 inches. The\r\nfemales do not quite reach this length.\r\n\r\nThe Green or Emerald-Lizard prefers rocky localities, from the sea-level,\r\nas for instance in Jersey, up to a height of several thousand feet. It is\r\nextremely swift and can climb trees, which it sometimes resorts to when\r\nchased. When hard pressed it takes tremendous leaps down to the ground,\r\nmarvellously enough without injury to body or tail, which latter is\r\notherwise very brittle. They pair in the spring or early summer after much\r\nfighting between the males; the eggs, to the number of about ten, are\r\nwhitish and are deposited a month later. The young are hatched after\r\nanother four weeks.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful lizard does not keep well in captivity, although it becomes\r\nvery tame; it eats meal-worms, snails, earth-worms, and insects, especially\r\nbutterflies, but it sickens after the first winter even if it has been\r\nallowed to hibernate.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal and Spain _L. viridis_ is represented by a slightly different\r\nkind, _L. schreiberi_, the chief interest of which lies in the fact that it\r\napproaches _L. ocellata_ in several respects. The occipital shield is large\r\nand is usually broader than the interparietal. The dorsal scales are\r\nsmaller, and there are eight {556}well-developed rows of ventral scales.\r\nInstead of being uniformly green, the upper parts are usually spotted and\r\nvermiculated with black; sometimes, especially in the females, the black\r\nspots have a white ocellus in the centre. The under parts are yellowish,\r\nwith or without black spots. The throat is blue. The young look very\r\ndifferent. They are olive-brown above with large yellow, or bluish-white,\r\nblack-edged ocelli on the side of the head and body.\r\n\r\nOther forms, perhaps of sub-specific rank, approaching _L. ocellata_, occur\r\nin the Balkan Peninsula, where, for instance in Dalmatia, the typical _L.\r\nviridis_ attains its most beautiful development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.–_Lacerta ocellata_ (the Eyed Lizard). × ⅓.]\r\n\r\n_L. ocellata_, the Eyed Lizard, inhabits Spain and Portugal, extending\r\nnorthwards into the South of France and into the Riviera, southwards into\r\nMorocco and Algeria; these southern forms (_L. pater_ and _L. tangitana_)\r\napproach _L. viridis_. The Eyed Lizard is green or dark olive above, with\r\nblack or yellowish dots, which are sometimes combined into a kind of\r\nnetwork pattern. The under parts are uniformly greenish yellow. The sides\r\nof the body are adorned with about two dozen blue, black-edged spots or\r\n\"eyes.\" The intensity of the blue and the depth of the green ground-colour\r\nvary much according to sex, time of the year, and state of health. Males\r\nduring the breeding season are most beautiful and brilliant. The occipital\r\nshield is broad; there are two superposed nasal but no tympanic shields.\r\nThe supraoculars are separated from the supraciliaries by a series of\r\ngranules. The collar is well marked, but not the gular fold. {557}The\r\ndorsal scales are minute and granular; the ventral shields are arranged in\r\neight or ten longitudinal rows.\r\n\r\nThe \"Eyed Lizard\" reaches a considerable size, especially the males, which\r\ndevelop a very strong and thick head, and are much more robust and powerful\r\nthan the more slender females. Old males reach a length of 2 feet,\r\ntwo-thirds of which length belong to the tail; but the latter varies much,\r\neven if it has never been broken and renewed.\r\n\r\nThe Eyed Lizard keeps extremely well in captivity, and in this respect is\r\nunlike the Green Lizard. A case has been recorded of its living thirteen\r\nyears. This species is very intelligent. Although at first ferociously wild\r\nand biting furiously, these lizards soon become tame and take food\r\nregularly. One of my own, a half-grown male from Northern Spain, about one\r\nfoot in length, made its home in a little niche of the greenhouse-wall,\r\nwhence it emerged regularly to take the offered food from my hand. It soon\r\nknew the whole place thoroughly, making use of the creepers whilst scaling\r\nup to its retreat, jumping over certain gaps, descending to the ground at\r\ncertain spots, basking on certain stones, invariably in the same methodical\r\nway. In the month of October it retires into the ground on the coolest side\r\nof the greenhouse, and although the latter is well warmed, the lizard\r\nremains invisible until the next February or March, when on some fine day\r\nit is rediscovered basking upon exactly the same stone where it had been\r\nseen five months before. The only drawback in connexion with keeping this\r\nkind of lizard in company with other creatures is their voraciousness;\r\nsince large, fully adult specimens attack and eat any other small lizard,\r\nslow-worm, or snake they can find. They also take mice. The eggs are often\r\ndeposited in hollow trees.\r\n\r\n_L. muralis_, the Wall-Lizard, is very common in Southern Europe, Asia\r\nMinor, and Northern Africa. Northward it extends into Belgium and into\r\nSouth Germany. In the Iberian Peninsula it ascends up to 5000 or 6000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. This graceful little creature, with an average\r\nlength of 6 to 8 inches, is easily recognised by the series of granules\r\nbetween the supraocular and supraciliary scales and usually by having only\r\nsix rows of ventral scales. The great variety in coloration has given rise\r\nto the establishment of many races, varieties, and sub-species. In the\r\ntypical forms the upper parts are brown or {558}greyish, with blackish\r\nspots or streaks, sometimes with a bronzy greenish sheen. The under parts\r\nare white, yellow, pink, or red, either uniform or, especially in the\r\nmales, with large black spots. The lateral rows of ventral shields are\r\nfrequently blue. The colour-varieties are almost endless. One of the most\r\nnoteworthy is that described as var. _coerulea_ by Eimer; this, confined to\r\nthe Faraglione Rocks near Cápri, is blackish above, like the rock, and\r\nsapphire-blue below. Similarly coloured specimens, var. _lilfordi_, occur\r\non some of the rocky islets of the Balearic Isles.\r\n\r\nThe Wall-Lizard deserves its name, since in the Mediterranean countries\r\nthere is scarcely a wall on which these active lizards do not bask or run\r\nup and down, often head downwards, in search of insects. They are\r\noviparous. The hibernation is short and not very deep, since these lizards\r\ncan sometimes be seen basking on sunny winter days before their regular\r\nappearance in the early spring.\r\n\r\n_Psammodromus_, with a few species in South-Western Europe, notably in the\r\nIberian Peninsula and in North-Western Africa, has no distinct semilunar\r\ncollar, but has a short fold in front of each arm. The back is covered with\r\nlarge, rhombic, strongly keeled and imbricating scales. The lateral scales\r\npass gradually into the ventrals, which are smooth and arranged in six\r\nlongitudinal rows.\r\n\r\n_P. hispanicus_ is bronzy brown above, with small black and white specks,\r\nand with one or two longitudinal streaks on each side. The under parts are\r\nwhite. Total length about 5 inches. Although also found inland, this\r\nspecies prefers sandy dunes, studded with prickly and scanty vegetation. It\r\nruns very fast and digs itself rapidly into the sand when pursued. When\r\ncaught it either utters a faint cry like \"tsi-tsi,\" or it feigns death. The\r\npairing takes place in June; half-a-dozen eggs are laid about eighteen days\r\nlater, deeply imbedded in the warm sand, and they are hatched in eight\r\nweeks. The eggs are said to grow[166] after they have been laid from 13 by\r\n7 mm. to 17-20 by 10-11 mm. The newly hatched little creatures measure\r\nabout 2 inches in length, more than half of which belongs to the tail.\r\n\r\n_P._ (_Tropidosaura_) _algirus_ has the same range as _P. hispanicus_, but\r\ngrows to 10 inches in length, and is much more {559}beautifully coloured.\r\nThe upper parts are bronzy brown with one or two golden, dark-edged,\r\nlateral streaks; the under parts are whitish; the male has one or more\r\nblue-eyed spots above each shoulder.\r\n\r\n_Acanthodactylus_ is distinguished by the laterally fringed digits. This\r\ngenus ranges throughout Northern Africa to the Punjab. One species, _A.\r\nvulgaris_, extends into Spain and Portugal. The dorsal scales are small and\r\nalmost smooth, but those on the tail are strongly keeled; the ventrals are\r\nmuch broader than long, and are arranged in eight to ten rows. The fringes\r\non the digits are but feebly developed in the shape of lateral\r\ndenticulations. The adults are grey-brown with faint longitudinal stripes,\r\nand with more conspicuous black and pale spots; in the breeding season\r\nlarger blue-eyed spots appear on the sides near the limbs. The tail is\r\noften pink, especially on the under surface. Total length about 7 inches.\r\n\r\nFAM. 12. GERRHOSAURIDAE.–Pleurodont African Lacertidae with osteoderms on\r\nthe head and body.\r\n\r\nThis family is intermediate between the Lacertidae and the Scincidae. The\r\ntongue is constructed like that of the Lacertidae, but is only feebly\r\nnicked anteriorly. Dermal ossifications roof over the temporal region, and\r\nfemoral pores are present. On the other hand, the osteoderms, which cover\r\nthe whole body, are in their structure and arrangement typically Scincoid.\r\nThe tail is long and fragile. A lateral fold is usually present. The limbs\r\nare sometimes reduced to useless stumps. The few genera and species of this\r\nfamily are strictly confined to the African sub-region, being found in the\r\nwhole of Africa south of the Sahara, and in Madagascar.\r\n\r\n_Gerrhosaurus_, with a strongly developed lateral fold and complete limbs,\r\noccurs in Africa. _G. flavigularis_, of South Africa, has a total length\r\nabout one foot.\r\n\r\n_Tetradactylus_, of South Africa, has also a strong lateral fold, but the\r\nlimbs are either very short and pentadactyle (_T. seps_), or tetradactyle,\r\nor they are minute pointed stumps, as in _T. africanus_.\r\n\r\nFAM. 13. SCINCIDAE.–Pleurodont lizards with strongly developed osteoderms\r\non head and body, with very feebly nicked, scaly tongue, with complete\r\ncranial arches, and with separated premaxillaries.\r\n\r\n{560}The temporal region is covered over, as in the Lacertidae, with\r\nstrongly developed, bony, dermal ossifications. Similar osteoderms underlie\r\nthe scales which cover the body and tail. The tongue is relatively short,\r\nnot forked behind, and but very feebly nicked at the tip; it is covered\r\nwith scale-like papillae. Femoral pores are absent.\r\n\r\nAll the Skinks prefer dry, sandy ground, in which they not only burrow, but\r\nmove quickly about, either for protection or in search of their animal\r\nfood. In connexion with this sand-loving and at least temporary\r\nsubterranean life stands the frequent reduction of the limbs. Every stage\r\nfrom the fully developed and functional pentadactyle limb to complete\r\nabsence of limbs is represented. There are species within the same genus\r\nwith five, four, three, or two fingers or toes. There are Skinks without\r\nfore-limbs, but with vestigial hind-limbs, and _vice versa_. The\r\ninteresting point is that these reductions do not indicate relationship\r\nwithin the family, but have happened independently. They are impressive\r\nillustrations of convergent retrogressive evolution.\r\n\r\n_Ablepharus_, widely distributed in the Old World, has the lower eyelid\r\ntransformed into a transparent cover, which is fused with the rim of the\r\nreduced upper lid, exactly as in the Lacertine genus _Ophiops_.\r\n\r\nAll the Scincidae seem to be viviparous, some of them, e.g. _Trachysaurus_,\r\nin the strict sense of the word, since the hard or parchment-like egg-shell\r\nhas been dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThe family contains about four hundred species, which have been arranged in\r\nnearly thirty genera, many of them on fanciful grounds. The family is\r\ncosmopolitan, but reaches its greatest diversity in numbers and forms in\r\nthe tropical parts of the Old World, especially in the Australian region,\r\ninclusive of the islands of the Pacific. America, notably South America,\r\nhas the smallest number.\r\n\r\n_Trachysaurus_, with one species, _T. rugosus_, inhabits the whole of the\r\nAustralian continent. It is easily recognised by the large and rough\r\nscales, and the short and broad stump-like tail. It is dark brown above\r\nwith yellowish irregular markings; the under parts are yellowish, marked\r\nwith brown. Embryos of this species have yellow transverse bands on the\r\nback, but these often fade away before birth. The creature is strictly\r\n{561}viviparous, the egg-membrane being very thin, and the two or three\r\nembryos are ripened in uterus-like dilatations of the oviducts. The period\r\nof gestation is about three months, and the birth takes place, in South\r\nAustralia, about April. According to Fischer[167] this species, which is\r\noften in the market, is easily kept. It requires warmth, sand and stones\r\nfor basking, and water, in which it soaks itself preparatory to the\r\nshedding of the skin, which takes place half-a-dozen times in the year, and\r\nis a slow process, requiring eight to ten days. The food consists chiefly\r\nof worms, lizards, and snakes, but meat, cabbage, and lettuce are also\r\ntaken. The total length is about one foot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.–_Trachysaurus rugosus._ × ⅓.]\r\n\r\n_Cyclodus_ s. _Tiliqua_, of Australia, Tasmania, and the Malay Islands, has\r\nstout lateral teeth with spherical crowns. The imbricating, cycloid scales\r\nof the body and the rather short but pointed tail are quite smooth and\r\nshiny. _C. gigas_, of New Guinea and the Moluccas, reaches a length of\r\nnearly 2 feet. The general colour is brownish yellow, with broad, dark\r\nbands across the body and tail.\r\n\r\n_Scincus_, of North Africa, Arabia, Persia, and Sindh, has pentadactyle\r\nlimbs, with laterally serrated digits. The eyelids are well developed, but\r\nthe ear is hidden under scaly flaps. _S. officinalis_, of the Sahara and of\r\nEgypt, grows to about 8 inches in length. The snout is peculiarly shaped,\r\ncuneiform. The eyes are very small. The scales of the body are perfectly\r\nsmooth; the sides of the belly are somewhat angular. The {562}whole shape\r\nof the creature, the scales, and the digits are adapted to burrowing and\r\nmoving quickly through the loose sand. The general colour is yellowish or\r\nbrownish above, each scale with small brown and whitish spots; the under\r\nparts are uniform whitish. The young are quite beautiful, being uniform\r\npale salmon-coloured above, silvery white below. When a little older,\r\nyellow spots appear on the flanks and grey bands across the back. These\r\nSkinks live in the absolutely dry reddish-yellow sand of the desert, in\r\nwhich they may almost be said to swim about, so swift and easy are their\r\nmovements. They live on insects, while in their turn they are eaten by\r\nsnakes, and above all by the _Varanus_ lizards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.–_Cyclodus gigas._ × ¼.]\r\n\r\nOf _Mabuia_ with about forty species, in the whole of Africa, Southern\r\nAsia, and in Tropical America, we mention only _M._ (_Euprepes_) _vittata_,\r\non account of its partly semi-aquatic life, a very rare condition among\r\nScincidae. This creature, about 7 inches long when full grown, frequents\r\ndamp localities in Tunis and Algeria, where the French call it \"Poisson de\r\nsable.\" It often sits on the floating leaves of _Nymphaea alba_, and dives\r\ninto the water in order to escape. Its proper element is, however, the\r\nsand, and for the night it retires under stones. The general colour is\r\nolive brown with a lighter vertebral band and two narrow whitish lines on\r\neach side, sometimes edged with black. The under parts are yellowish or\r\ngreenish white.\r\n\r\n_Chalcides_ s. _Seps_ s. _Gongylus_, of the Mediterranean countries\r\n{563}also occurs in South-Western Asia. The lower eyelid has a transparent\r\ndisc. The body is much elongated, and is covered with smooth shiny scales.\r\nThe limbs are very short, or reduced to mere vestiges.\r\n\r\n_Ch. ocellatus_, of the Southern Mediterranean countries, occurring also in\r\nMalta and Sardinia, reaches about 10 inches in length. The snout is\r\nconical, the ear-opening a small slit or hole. The limbs have five fingers\r\nand toes. The under parts are uniform silvery white, but the colour of the\r\nupper parts is very variable, mostly olive brown with black spots and\r\nirregular cross-bars, or with dark and light spots; sometimes uniform\r\nbronzy brown with a light upper and a black lateral band. This Skink seems\r\nto have no fixed abode, but digs itself into the sand wherever it wants to\r\nhide. The skin is not shed in flakes, but, as in most Skinks, it peels off\r\nby a process of gradual desquamation. Fischer's specimens paired towards\r\nthe end of December. The gestation lasted 56 days, when nine young were\r\nborn, which measured about 75 mm. or 3 inches; when three weeks old they\r\nhad increased to nearly double this length.\r\n\r\n_Ch. lineatus_, of Spain and Portugal, and of the South of France, like\r\n_Ch. tridactylus_ of Italy and North-West Africa, has only three fingers\r\nand toes. The fore-limbs are only about one quarter of an inch in length in\r\nlarge specimens of 10 inches total length; the hind-limbs are a little\r\nlonger. The general colour is bronzy olive or brown above, in the former\r\nspecies with nine or eleven darker longitudinal streaks; uniform, and with\r\nan even number of streaks in the latter species. _Ch. bedriagae_, of Spain\r\nand Portugal, has mostly five fingers and toes, and the limbs are\r\nrelatively longer in this smaller species; but it is a question if these\r\nand other species of this genus are not to a great extent simply individual\r\nvariations, since the reduction of the limbs and toes seems to be a very\r\nrecent feature. _Ch. guentheri_, of Palestine, otherwise in every respect\r\nlike _Ch. tridactylus_, but reaching a length of more than 14 inches, has\r\nthe limbs reduced to tiny conical stumps without a trace of separate\r\ndigits.\r\n\r\nI have caught _Seps_ accidentally under stones or pieces of bark in sandy\r\ndistricts. On the western coast of Galicia and Portugal, close to the sea,\r\nthey frequent the gorse-bushes, on which they can be seen basking, provided\r\nthey are approached {564}stealthily. They disappear on the slightest alarm,\r\nalmost swimming, as it were, with great agility through the prickly cover,\r\nand then hiding and wriggling through the loose sand between the roots.\r\n\r\nThe following five \"families\" are composed of degraded forms of various\r\ndescent. Most of them lead a burrowing, subterranean life, in adaptation to\r\nwhich the body has become snake-shaped or worm-like. The fore-limbs are\r\nentirely absent, except in _Chirotes_; the hind-limbs are absent, or\r\nreduced to small flaps; the girdles are reduced correspondingly. The skull\r\nis devoid of postorbital, postfronto-squamosal, supratemporal, and jugal\r\narches. The quadrate bone is mostly immovable. The eyes and ears are\r\nconcealed, except in the Pygopodidae.\r\n\r\nFAM. 14. ANELYTROPIDAE.–An artificial assembly of a few degraded Scincoids.\r\nThe worm-shaped, limbless body is devoid of osteoderms. The tongue is\r\nshort, slightly nicked anteriorly, and covered with imbricating papillae.\r\nColumellae cranii are present. _Anelytropsis papillosus_ in Mexico.\r\n_Typhlosaurus_ and _Feylinia_ in South and West Africa.\r\n\r\nFAM. 15. DIBAMIDAE, consisting of the genus _Dibamus_, with _D.\r\nnovae-guineae_, in New Guinea, the Moluccas, Celebes, and the Nicobar\r\nIslands. The tongue is arrow-shaped, undivided in front, covered with\r\ncurved papillae. Columellae cranii are absent. The vermiform body is\r\ncovered with cycloid imbricating scales without osteoderms. The limbs and\r\neven their arches are absent, but in the males the hind-limbs are\r\nrepresented by a pair of flaps. Total length of the animal about 6 inches.\r\n\r\nFAM. 16. ANIELLIDAE.–The genus _Aniella_ comprises a few small worm- or\r\nsnake-shaped species in California, which seem to be degraded forms of\r\nAnguidae. The eyes and ears are concealed, limbs are entirely absent, the\r\nbody and tail are covered with soft, imbricating, more or less hexagonal\r\nscales. The tongue is villose, smooth, and bifid anteriorly. The teeth are\r\nrelatively large, few in numbers, recurved, with short swollen bases. The\r\nskull, by reduction, approaches the Ophidian type; there is no columella\r\ncranii, the postorbital arch is ligamentous, the premaxillary is single,\r\nthe nasals and frontals remain separate, the pre- and post-orbitals are in\r\ncontact with each other, excluding the frontal from the orbit.\r\n\r\n_A. pulchra._–Silvery, the scales edged with brown; back and {565}tail with\r\na narrow, brown, median line.  Total length, 7 to 8 inches.\r\n\r\nFAM. 17. AMPHISBAENIDAE.–Worm-shaped lizards with the soft skin forming\r\nnumerous rings, each of which is divided into many little squares, the\r\nvestiges of scales which are otherwise restricted to the head. The eyes and\r\nears are concealed. Limbs are absent except in _Chirotes_, which has short\r\nfour-clawed fore-limbs. The pectoral arch, and still more so the pelvic\r\narch, are reduced to minute vestiges. The tail is very short. The skull is\r\nsmall, compact, and strongly ossified, in adaptation to the burrowing life,\r\nand is devoid of postorbital and postfronto-squamosal arches and of\r\ncolumellae. The teeth are either acrodont or pleurodont. The tongue is\r\nslightly elongated, covered with scale-like papillae, and bifurcates into\r\ntwo long and narrow smooth points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.–Map showing the distribution of Amphisbaenidae.]\r\n\r\nThe Amphisbaenas lead an entirely subterranean, burrowing life, like\r\nearth-worms. They are frequently found in ants' nests or in manure-heaps.\r\nTheir progression is very worm-like, their annulated soft skin enabling\r\nthem to make almost peristaltic motions and to move backwards as well as\r\nforwards. They crawl in a straight line, with slight vertical waves, not,\r\nlike other limbless lizards or snakes, by lateral undulations. The food\r\nconsists of worms and small insects. About one dozen genera with more than\r\nsixty species are known, most of which inhabit the warmer parts of America,\r\nthe West Indies, and Africa. Four inhabit Mediterranean countries.\r\n\r\n{566}If the tongue and the dentition be taken as indications of\r\nrelationship, the Amphisbaenidae may perhaps be considered as degraded\r\ndescendants of Iguanidae, a family which contains various limbless,\r\nburrowing, worm-shaped forms. But it is also possible that the\r\nAmphisbaenidae are not a natural group. This consideration applies with\r\nmost force to the genera _Amphisbaena_ and _Anops_, the various species of\r\nwhich occur in America and in Africa.\r\n\r\n_Chirotes canaliculatus_, the only species of the genus, is the only\r\nAmphisbaenid which still possesses fore-limbs. These are short, stout,\r\nplaced close behind the head, and are provided with four-clawed digits.\r\nThis species occurs in Mexico and California, is brownish or\r\nflesh-coloured, and reaches a length of about 8 inches.\r\n\r\n_Amphisbaena_, with nearly thirty species, in Tropical America and Africa.\r\nOn account of the short rounded-off head and the almost equally blunt tail\r\nthese creatures are called by the natives \"cobras de dous cabezas,\" _i.e._\r\nsnakes with two heads, or they are known as \"maes das formigas,\" _i.e._\r\nmothers of ants, because of their predilection for taking up their quarters\r\nin the nests of ants or termites. The scientific name refers of course to\r\ntheir capability of moving forwards and backwards (ἀμφίς, at both ends, and\r\nβαίνω, walk).\r\n\r\n_A. fuliginosa_, one of the commonest species in South America and in the\r\nWest Indies, is chequered black and white. The skin of the body has about\r\ntwo hundred rings, the tail about thirty. Total length between one and two\r\nfeet. A more or less distinct fold extends along each side of the body from\r\nthe neck to the tail, at the level where the dorsal scales originally\r\njoined the ventral scales.\r\n\r\n_Blanus_ is the only genus of the Mediterranean province. _B. cinereus_, of\r\nPortugal, Spain south of the Cantabrian range, Morocco, and Algeria,\r\nreaches a length of 10 inches, but such large specimens are rather rare.\r\nThe general colour of the living animal is pink with a brownish tinge and\r\nwith minute grey specks. The lateral lines or folds are well marked, and a\r\nstronger transverse fold is placed behind the head. The body shows from one\r\nhundred and ten to one hundred and twenty-five rings, the tail from twenty\r\nto twenty-two; each body-ring contains about thirty little squares or\r\nremnants of scales. There are a few pre-anal pores.\r\n\r\n{567}I have sometimes found this species in Portugal whilst digging for\r\nearth-worms in manure-heaps and similar moist places, where they lead the\r\nsame life as the worms except that they live upon them and upon insects.\r\nWhen kept dry they become very thin and shrunken, but when put back into\r\nmoist soil they again become turgid and supple within a short time. Those\r\nwhich I have kept in glass jars filled with rich mould throve very well,\r\nliving upon the tiny insects and worms which infest such compost soil; they\r\ndug long tortuous channels, in which they moved forwards and sometimes\r\nbackwards, but they never came to the surface.\r\n\r\nFAM. 18. PYGOPODIDAE.–Pleurodont, snake-shaped lizards, without fore-limbs,\r\nbut with the hind-limbs appearing as a pair of scaly flaps.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder-girdle is much reduced. The hind-limbs, although very small\r\nand hidden within the scaly, almost fin-like flaps, still possess five\r\ntoes. The ischium appears externally as a small spur on either side of the\r\nanal cleft. The eyes are devoid of movable lids, remaining open and\r\nunprotected; the pupil is vertical. The ear is either concealed or exposed.\r\nThe tongue is fleshy, slightly forked and extensible. The body is covered\r\nwith roundish imbricating scales. The tail is very long and brittle. The\r\nfew genera of this undoubtedly natural family of unknown relationship\r\ncontain in all about ten species, restricted entirely to Australia,\r\nTasmania, and perhaps New Guinea. Next to nothing is known about their\r\nhabits, except that some of them eat other lizards.\r\n\r\n_Pygopus lepidopus_ is distributed over the whole of Australia. It reaches\r\na total length of about 2 feet, 16 inches of which belong to the tail.\r\nGeneral colour coppery grey above, sometimes with several longitudinal\r\nseries of dark spots.\r\n\r\n_Lialis burtoni_ of nearly the same size and equally wide distribution has\r\nthe hind-limbs reduced to extremely small, scarcely visible, narrow\r\nappendages.\r\n\r\nSUB-ORDER 3. CHAMAELEONTES.–_Acrodont Old-World Saurians with a laterally\r\ncompressed body, prehensile tail, and well-developed limbs with the digits\r\narranged in opposing, grasping, bundles of two and three respectively._\r\n\r\nThe Chameleons are an essentially African family. About half of the fifty\r\nspecies known inhabit Madagascar, the others {568}the African continent.\r\nOne, the common Chameleon, is North African, extending into Andalucia; two\r\nothers occur in South Arabia and Socotra, and only one in Southern India\r\nand Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThis sub-order is well distinguished from all other Saurians by several,\r\nmostly unique, characters. The tongue is club-shaped and extremely\r\nprojectile, to a length equal to that of the body. The head is usually\r\ndescribed as forming a casque, with prominent crests and tubercles. There\r\nis no tympanum and no tympanic cavity. The parietal bones, united into one,\r\nextend backwards far beyond the occiput, and the tip of this projection is\r\nmet by a much-elongated supratemporal bone, which, partly fused with the\r\nsquamosal, helps to enclose a huge supratemporal fossa. The latter is\r\nwidely open behind. The postfronto-squamosal arch and the postorbital arch\r\nare strong. The jugal is widely separated from the quadrate; the latter\r\nstands vertically and is not reached by the pterygoid. There is no\r\ncolumella cranii. The pre- and post-frontals often join to form a\r\nsupra-orbital roof. The nasals are very small and are excluded from the\r\nnares, which are bordered entirely by the enlarged prefrontals and by the\r\nmaxillaries. The premaxillaries are small and carry no teeth. The latter\r\nare acrodont, compressed and tricuspid, and are restricted to the\r\nmaxillaries and mandibles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148.–Map showing the distribution of Chameleons.]\r\n\r\nThe limbs are peculiar. Not only are they relatively long and very slender,\r\nbut two digits are permanently opposed to the other three. On the hand the\r\nfirst three fingers form an inner bundle opposed to the outer, or fourth\r\nand fifth fingers. On the foot the inner bundle is formed by the first and\r\nsecond, the outer by the other toes. The shoulder-girdle is of the ordinary\r\nSaurian type, but there are no clavicles and no interclavicle. The costal\r\nsternum is well developed; the ribs posterior to those which meet the\r\nsternum are very thin and elongated: they meet and fuse with their fellows\r\nin the medio-ventral line. These hoops are not connected with their\r\nneighbours in front or behind. The tail is prehensile by being rolled\r\ndownwards; it is not brittle and is incapable of being renewed. The skin is\r\nnot covered with scales, but with {569}granules. The eyes are very\r\nremarkable. The eyeballs themselves are large, but the eyelids are united\r\ninto one fold with a small central opening. However, when the Chameleon is\r\nasleep the margins of this opening sometimes become more slit-like. The\r\nright and left eye can be, and are incessantly, moved separately from each\r\nother, and the creature squints terribly. Each eyeball, together with the\r\npin-hole eyelid, is rolled up and down, backwards and forwards,\r\nindependently of the other eye. This is a unique feature, but it also\r\noccurs in people who squint badly. The question \"What, and how, do these\r\ncreatures see?\" is therefore quite idle, especially since in reptiles\r\nbinocular vision does not exist at all and, consequently, cannot be\r\ndisturbed by squinting.\r\n\r\nThe tongue has attained an extraordinary development. The tongue proper\r\n(Fig. 152) is club-shaped, and is covered with a sticky secretion. The base\r\nor root of the tongue is very narrow, composed of extremely elastic fibres,\r\nand is supported by a much-elongated copular piece of the hyoid. The\r\nelastic part of the tongue is, so to speak, telescoped over the\r\nstyle-shaped copula, and the whole apparatus is kept in a contracted state\r\nlike a spring in a tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 149.–A, Dorsal, B, ventral, and C, lateral view of the\r\nskull of _Chamaeleon vulgaris_. × 1. _Cond_, occipital condyle; _EP_,\r\nectopterygoid; _Jug_, jugal; _Lac_, lacrymal; _Pal_, palatine; _Par_,\r\nparietal; _Prf_, prefrontal; _Pt.f_, postfrontal; _Ptg_, pterygoid; _Q_,\r\nquadrate; _Sq_, squamosal; _Vo_, vomer.]\r\n\r\nA pair of wide, very elastic blood-vessels and special elastic bands extend\r\nfrom the base into the thick end of the tongue. {570}By rapidly filling the\r\napparatus with blood, and by the action of certain hyoid muscles, the\r\nspring is, so to speak, released, and the momentum gained by the thick and\r\nheavy club-shaped tongue proper projects it far out of the mouth. The\r\nsticky end of the club shapes itself into an upper and a lower flap, which\r\npartly envelop the prey, and the elastic bands of the far-stretched stalk\r\nwithdraw the whole. The detailed working of this ingenious shooting\r\napparatus is not easy to follow. An ordinary full-grown Chameleon can shoot\r\na fly at the distance of 7 or 8 inches. The whole performance is very\r\nquick, lasting less than one second. When the desired object is very near,\r\nonly 2 or 3 inches off, the Chameleon has a certain difficulty in shooting\r\nits prey. The tongue is at first put out slowly, tentatively, the following\r\njerk is feeble, and it seems as if the apparatus refuses to work unless it\r\nis allowed to shoot out with full force.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable and quite proverbial feature of Chameleons is their\r\nchanging of colour. This is by no means restricted to Chameleons, which\r\nindeed are rivalled in this respect by various other lizards, for instance\r\nby the Indian Agamoid _Calotes_ and by the American _Ameiva_.\r\n\r\nThe microscopical structure and mechanism of the colour-changing apparatus\r\nis, in _Chamaeleon vulgaris_, as follows:–\r\n\r\nThe epidermis is colourless, and the Malpighian layer is not particularly\r\nmodified except that in it are imbedded some iridescent cells, with very\r\nminute wavy striation on their surface. The cutis contains in its leathery\r\ntissue a great number of small and closely packed cells, filled with\r\nstrongly refractive granules, chiefly guanine-crystals. These cause the\r\nwhite colour by diffuse reflection of direct light. The cells nearer the\r\nsurface are charged with oil-drops and appear yellow. Large chromatophores\r\nare imbedded in the white granular mass, most of them with blackish-brown,\r\nothers with reddish pigment, the granules of which are shifted up and down,\r\ntowards and away from the surface of the cutis, in ramified branches of the\r\nchromatophores. When these branches are contracted the pigment is conveyed\r\nback into the bulbous basal portion of the chromatophores and the skin\r\nappears yellow or white. When all the pigment is shifted towards the\r\nsurface of the cutis, the animal looks dark, sometimes black. In\r\nintermediate conditions the light is changed into green by diffraction\r\nthrough the yellowish upper strata and by the finely {571}striated\r\niridescent cells of the Malpighian layer. Those parts into which the\r\nchromatophores do not send pigment appear as yellow spots. The\r\nchromatophores are to a great extent under control of the will of the\r\nChameleon, but external stimuli, as heat and cold and other reflex actions,\r\nalso play a great part in their movements.\r\n\r\nFor further information on this subject see Brücke,[168] P. Bert,[169]\r\nPouchet,[170] Thilenius,[171] and lastly Keller,[172] who has written a\r\nvery long but rather confused account.\r\n\r\nThe process of moulting is curious. When the Chameleon is in good health\r\nthe whole process is accomplished within a few hours. The skin to be cast\r\noff becomes loose and assumes a blistered appearance. Sometimes the\r\ncreature looks as if it were wrapped up in white, semi-transparent tissue\r\npaper. By rubbing against stones, or between the twigs of trees, the skin\r\ncomes off in large flakes, first on the lips, then on the contorted body,\r\nand last on the under surface of the hands and feet. During a rapid and\r\nsuccessful moult the changes of colour go on as usual in the new skin.\r\nSometimes large flakes of the old skin remain adherent for days, especially\r\non the top of the head. The moulting takes place several times in one year.\r\nOne of my _Ch. vulgaris_ moulted in January and September, and then not\r\nuntil June of the next following year. A _Ch. pumilus_ moulted in the\r\nmonths of May, October, and March.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 150.–Diagrammatic section through the skin of a\r\nChameleon. Highly magnified. _C_, deeper portion of the cutis; _Ch_, three\r\nchromatophores, in various stages of contraction, filled with black, brown,\r\nor reddish pigment; _E_, epidermis; _W_, white layer of granules; _Y_,\r\nyellow layer of cells.]\r\n\r\nWhen they know themselves to be discovered, Chameleons make themselves as\r\nthin as possible by compressing the body or rather the belly. This is done\r\nby means of the peculiarly elongated abdominal ribs described above. The\r\nwhole body is then put into such a position that, by presenting only its\r\nnarrow edge to the enemy, it has become as little visible as {572}possible.\r\nAt the same time the Chameleon turns round upon its twig, so that the\r\nlatter comes to stand between the observer and its own body, which may\r\nthereby be completely hidden. When angry, the creature either presents its\r\nbroadest surface, swaying to the right and left, or it blows itself up and\r\nhisses. The lungs are very capacious, and, instead of being bag-shaped, end\r\nin several narrow blind sacs which extend far down into the body-cavity, so\r\nthat not only the chest but the whole body can be blown up.\r\n\r\nThe usual mode of propagation is by means of eggs, but a few species allied\r\nto _Ch. pumilus_ are viviparous. The time of incubation and of gestation is\r\nlong. For instance, the pairing of _Ch. vulgaris_ takes place in the month\r\nof August. The eggs are laid in the last week of October, about fifty to\r\nsixty days later. Sometimes, however, the eggs are retained much longer,\r\nsince I have received specimens with ripening eggs in July which did not\r\nlay until the end of October. The eggs are deposited in the ground and are\r\nnot hatched until the following February or March, _i.e._ about 130 days\r\nlater. The new-born little creatures are snowy white, and cannot change or\r\nrather assume colour until after the second week.\r\n\r\nAll Chameleons are insectivorous and require enormous quantities of food,\r\nwhich must be alive to be taken. Most of them prefer Orthoptera, _e.g._\r\nLocusts and Grasshoppers, and Lepidoptera. They also eat flies, meal-worms,\r\nand cockroaches, but their tastes differ not only individually but also\r\ntemporarily. They require change of diet. One individual will take\r\ncockroaches greedily, whilst another of the same kind will rather starve\r\nitself than touch one. The same applies to meal-worms. It is a great but\r\ncommon mistake to suppose that Chameleons do not require water. On the\r\ncontrary they drink regularly and often, generally by licking up drops of\r\nwater or by scooping them up with their lips, shoving the snout along the\r\nedges of wet leaves. It is not too much to say that most Chameleons are\r\nshort-lived in captivity on account of the want of water. Those which are\r\nsold by the dealers are generally in a parched condition. Sprinkling the\r\ntwigs or leaves of their cage with water works a wonderful change in them;\r\nthe dull, apathetic-looking creatures drink and drink, revive, assume\r\nbrighter colours, and will soon take food, which they have until then\r\nrefused {573}obstinately. Once I have even seen a Chameleon, when put into\r\nthe greenhouse, make straight for a tank and actually drink in gulps.\r\n\r\nAfter they have fattened themselves in the autumn, Chameleons, at least\r\nthose of North Africa, withdraw to hibernate in the ground. But nothing is\r\nknown about how, when, and where they do this, nor is it known if tropical\r\nspecies aestivate during the dry season.\r\n\r\nChameleons are notoriously difficult to keep successfully, whereby we do\r\nnot mean the keeping for three to six months. This is easy enough, since it\r\ntakes them several months to die of starvation. The difficulty is to keep\r\nthem through the winter. To enable them to do this, it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to fatten them up during the summer and autumn. Otherwise,\r\nalthough kept in a warm place, they are liable to lose their appetite in\r\nthe autumn, when they become restless, probably with the desire to\r\nhibernate. Those few individuals which get over this critical period, say\r\nduring the month of October, and do not refuse food, are probably safe. But\r\nthose are doomed which refuse to eat meal-worms or cockroaches or such food\r\nas can be procured easily during the winter.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the Chameleons is unknown. They form only one family,\r\nCHAMAELEONTIDAE, with between fifty and sixty species, which, with a few\r\nexceptions, belong to the genus _Chamaeleon_.\r\n\r\n_Ch. vulgaris_ is the Common Chameleon of North Africa, Syria, and Asia\r\nMinor. It occurs also in a few parts of Southern Andalucia, for instance\r\nnear Jerez, and near Nerja, to the east of Malaga, where it has possibly\r\nbeen introduced. A series of conical, slightly enlarged granules forms a\r\nlittle crest on the median line of the throat. A whitish line, which does\r\nnot change colour, extends from the chin to the vent. The rest of the skin,\r\nwith the exception of a median dorsal series of slightly enlarged tubercles\r\non part of the back, is composed of small granules. A small but distinct\r\nlobe of leathery skin extends along either side of the occiput towards the\r\nposterior end of the median parietal crest. Dead or spirit-specimens are\r\nusually pale yellow; living ones are greenish, usually with differently\r\ncoloured patches on the sides. Exceptionally large males reach a total\r\nlength of about 9 inches, females reach the length of perhaps a foot, but\r\nabout half of the total length belongs to the tail.\r\n\r\n{574}It is impossible to say what is the colour of this Chameleon, since\r\nthe same specimen may within a few days appear in half-a-dozen different\r\ngarbs, not counting minor combinations of colour. After it has been watched\r\nfor several months, when all its possibilities seem to be exhausted, it\r\nwill probably surprise us by a totally new combination. Not every specimen\r\nchanges alike: some keep the same appearance for a long time, others change\r\noften; some are partial to specks, others to large patches. In the group of\r\nChameleons shown in Fig. 152 several of the more usual arrangements of\r\ncolour have been indicated by stippling and various kinds of\r\ncross-hatching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 151.–_Chamaeleon vulgaris._ × ⅔.]\r\n\r\nA represents the usual coloration at night. The whole animal, which has\r\njust been stirred up from its sleep in the dark, is cream-coloured, with\r\nirregular patches of yellow on the head, the back, the sides of the body,\r\nthe legs, and the tail.\r\n\r\nB has the usual coloration: grey-green, with innumerable small darker\r\nspecks, with two series of pale brown patches on the sides of the body, and\r\nwith one patch on the region of the ear.\r\n\r\n{575}[Illustration: FIG. 152.–Showing changes of colour in Chameleons. A to\r\nD, _Chamaeleon vulgaris_ (see p. 574). _Chamaeleon pumilus_ in the right\r\nupper corner.]\r\n\r\n{576}C is the same specimen in an excited frame of mind; it is represented\r\nin the act of shooting a fly. The light brown patches have changed to\r\nmaroon brown; and many round golden yellow spots have appeared on the green\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nD shows a specimen, coloured like C, within a few seconds after it has been\r\nput into an angry mood, in the present case by having its tail squeezed.\r\nThe whole body is blown out, the thick tongue causes the throat to bulge\r\nout, and all the yellow spots have become blackish green.\r\n\r\nMany small spots scattered over the body are usually a sign of anger. One\r\nof the specimens described above was, when fast asleep in a dark room,\r\ndirty white, with about two dozen large and small round spots of a rich\r\nyellow on each side of its body. Then a lighted lamp was brought into the\r\nroom without in any way disturbing the animal. Within sixteen minutes the\r\nyellow spots had vanished completely; the whole body and tail had become\r\nsuffused with greenish yellow, which gradually turned to pale yellowish\r\ngreen, and those parts which in Fig. B are pale brown, were just\r\ndistinguishable as pale yellowish-white regions. The Chameleon was found to\r\nbe fast asleep, and it kept this coloration during the rest of the evening.\r\nOther specimens behaved on similar occasions in the same way, but the\r\ngreatest interest is attached to the fact that frequently only that side of\r\nthe body \"greened up\" which happened to be exposed to the light, whilst the\r\nopposite side remained whitish. These changes are not absolutely\r\nunconscious; they are, after all, under the control of the creature. In\r\norder to test the possibility of direct action of the light, I have taken\r\nthe precaution of throwing the light of a candle only upon the body, whilst\r\nthe head was kept in darkness. No changes of colour took place whilst the\r\nanimal was asleep, but when a little light was allowed to sweep across the\r\nclosed eye, this soon began to twitch, and although the creature did not\r\nopen the eye, the usual changes of colour began to take place. When the\r\nlight was removed, the animal soon re-assumed its whitish appearance.\r\nArtificially coloured light, for instance green, red, or blue glass or\r\npaper, has apparently no influence upon the changes of colour. The\r\nChameleons behave as they would behave under ordinary conditions. Direct\r\nand hot sunshine however causes them to darken, sometimes to turn uniform\r\ndull black, except for the white median ventral {577}line. Occasionally I\r\nfound one of the specimens described above deep maroon brown, with dozens\r\nof round orange spots. Blue and red do not seem to be within the range of\r\n_Ch. vulgaris_, but the combinations of green, yellow, brown, black, and\r\nwhite, with their various shades, are almost endless. Sometimes the\r\nChameleons do not turn pale during the night, but remain more or less dull\r\ngreen, with or without brownish patches. Adaptation to their immediate\r\nsurroundings takes place to a very moderate degree only, but as a rule they\r\nare brightest, especially in their green tints, when they are allowed to\r\nsit amongst green foliage. The introduction of a branch with fresh leaves\r\ngenerally has a brightening effect upon those which have previously been\r\nconfined in a cage with dry twigs only. Cold does not necessarily make them\r\npale, but they appear duller, and the changes take place more slowly. After\r\nall, Linnaeus has summed up the little we really know about the causes of\r\nthese changes, in the following terse sentence: \"Vivus varios colores\r\nassumit secundum animi passiones, calorem et frigus.\"\r\n\r\nChameleons are not very amiable. When taken up they blow themselves out or\r\nthey bite painfully, and it is a long time before they are tame enough not\r\nto go through various antics of anger when one approaches them. When taken\r\nin the hand they produce a peculiar faint grunting noise, which, however,\r\ncan be better felt than heard. They quarrel much amongst each other; and\r\nthe males, during the pairing season, are particularly ill-tempered. Each\r\nindividual selects its own particular branch to sleep on, if possible a\r\nhorizontal one, upon which it crouches down lengthwise, with the head and\r\nbelly resting upon the branch. The tail generally makes a turn round\r\nanother branch, and the four legs, grasping some supporting branch, are put\r\ninto any, sometimes into an almost incredibly, awkward position. Although\r\nthey climb about a good deal during the daytime, they generally resort to\r\ntheir accustomed sleeping branch, and they defend this vigorously against\r\nwould-be intruders.\r\n\r\nChameleons are most deliberate in their movements, sometimes provokingly\r\nslow. Each arm and foot leaves the firmly grasped branch with great\r\nhesitation, and makes with equal deliberation for some other foothold. It\r\ndoes not matter if the thigh appears almost twisted out of its joint. The\r\ncreature will {578}remain in the most uncomfortable position, forgetting,\r\none might think, to put one or more of its limbs down, but keeping them\r\ninstead in the air.\r\n\r\nIt is most interesting to watch them stalking their prey. Suppose we have\r\nintroduced some butterflies into their roomy cage, which is furnished with\r\nliving plants and with plenty of twigs. The Chameleons, hitherto quite\r\nmotionless, perhaps basking with flattened-out bodies so as to catch as\r\nmany of the sun's rays as possible, become at once lively. One of them\r\nmakes for a butterfly which has settled in the farther upper corner of the\r\ncage. With unusually fast motions the Chameleon stilts along and across the\r\nbranches and all seems to go well, until he discovers that the end of the\r\nbranch is still 8 inches from the prey, and he knows perfectly well that 7\r\ninches are the utmost limit to a shot with his tongue. He pauses to think,\r\nperhaps with two limbs in the air, but stability is secured by a judicious\r\nturn of the tail. After he has solved the puzzle, he retraces his steps to\r\nthe base of the branch, climbs up the main stem, creeps along the next\r\nbranch above, and when arrived at the 7 inch distance, he shoots the\r\nbutterfly with unerring aim. The capacity of the mouth and throat is\r\nastonishing. A full-grown Chameleon will catch, chew, and swallow the\r\nlargest moth, for instance a _Sphinx ligustri_. When large, the prey is\r\nchewed, but the wings and legs are swallowed with the rest. Occasionally\r\nthese parts are bitten off, especially the prickly long legs of large\r\nlocusts.\r\n\r\nIn water Chameleons are quite helpless. Sometimes they inflate themselves,\r\nbut they always topple over on to the side, and the movements of their\r\nlimbs are absolutely without any definite purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the eggs are ripe, and this happens with the Common Chameleon about\r\nthe end of October, the female refuses to take food, and becomes restless.\r\nOne of my specimens searched about probing the ground for about a week\r\nbefore she dug a hole in some more solid soil. This took two days. In the\r\nevening I found her sitting in the hole to the middle of her body. On the\r\nfollowing morning she was still there, but busy filling the hole with soil\r\nand covering it with dry leaves. A few eggs were lying about outside, two\r\nof which at least I saw her taking up by the hand and putting them on the\r\n{579}nest, which was found to contain some thirty soft-shelled eggs closely\r\npacked upon each other. During the whole process she was very snappy, and\r\nhissed much when approached. After that she crept into the twigs as usual,\r\nbut refused to eat, vomited at once the artificially introduced food,\r\nbecame restless on the sixth day, crawling about at the bottom of the cage,\r\nand died on the following day. This is the usual fate, almost without\r\nexception, of females after they have deposited their eggs in captivity.\r\nThe great number of eggs and their deposition naturally exhausts them, and\r\nthey probably want to hibernate at once. The eggs, which are yellowish,\r\nlong-oval, about half an inch long and covered with a parchment-like shell,\r\nare very difficult to rear, chiefly on account of the difficulty of\r\nregulating the moisture. They shrink up when too dry, and they are very\r\nliable to become mouldy. According to Fischer[173] the eggs can be hatched\r\nin a large flower-pot with a layer of horse-droppings at the bottom, then a\r\nlayer of 6 inches of slightly moist soil, then the eggs, then another 6\r\ninches of loose soil, with a glass plate covering the top, securing at the\r\nsame time ventilation. In this way he succeeded in hatching several sets of\r\neggs after 125 and 133 days respectively.\r\n\r\n_Ch. calcaratus_, the Indian Chameleon, is found in the southern half of\r\nthe Peninsula and in Ceylon, but it is far from common. It much resembles\r\n_Ch. vulgaris_, but the male is distinguished by a tarsal process or\r\n\"spur,\" covered with skin, on the inner side of the foot.\r\n\r\n_Ch. pumilus_, the Dwarf Chameleon of South Africa, reaches a total length\r\nof 5 to 6 inches. It has a well-marked, serrated gular crest, which extends\r\nfrom the chin to the end of the neck. The chest and belly are without a\r\ntoothed line, but a strongly serrated series extends from the occiput over\r\nthe back and tail (see the right upper corner of Fig. 152 on p. 575). A row\r\nof enlarged tubercles or scales extends along the sides of the body. The\r\ngeneral colour is green, with a large and long patch of brick-red on the\r\nsides; small dots and spots of intense red are scattered over various parts\r\nof the body. The changes of colour are rather limited. At night the Dwarf\r\nChameleon does not turn pale, but generally keeps its colour. When they are\r\nvery well the green is quite saturated, and the large red patch on the side\r\nis {580}interrupted by several blue spots. When they are angry or unhappy\r\nthe red turns into dirty brown, and the green becomes quite dull. Sometimes\r\nthe whole animal turns dull black.\r\n\r\nThis pretty little species is relatively hardy, being, as a native of South\r\nAfrica, accustomed to cold nights. It does well in an ordinary temperate\r\ngreenhouse, where it will live for several years, provided it has an ample\r\nsupply of flies and meal-worms. It is viviparous, the young being probably\r\nborn in the month of March or April.\r\n\r\n_Ch. bifidus_, of Madagascar, shows an extraordinary difference between the\r\nsexes. The male reaches the great length of 16 inches, and develops two\r\nlong rostral processes, which extend forwards beyond the snout; these\r\nprocesses are formed of dense connective tissue, which ossifies in the\r\nadult, and they are covered with scaly skin.\r\n\r\n_Ch. parsoni_, likewise of Madagascar, is the giant amongst Chameleons,\r\nreaching a total length of 2 feet. The male has two large rostral processes\r\nwhich diverge upwards and outwards.\r\n\r\n_Brookesia_, with several species in Madagascar, may be mentioned on\r\naccount of its stunted appearance. The tail is much shorter than the body\r\nand scarcely prehensile; the scales on the soles are spinous. Total length\r\nonly about 3 inches.\r\n\r\n_Rhampholeon_, of tropical continental Africa, with several species, is\r\nlikewise remarkable for the stunted and dwarfed appearance, and for the\r\npeculiar claws, each of which is furnished with a second cusp which is\r\ndirected downwards. The tail is much shorter than the body. The total\r\nlength of _Rh. spectrum_ of the Camaroons is about 3 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{581}CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nSAURIA, _continued_–OPHIDIA–SNAKES\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. OPHIDIA–_SNAKES_.\r\n\r\n_Saurians which have the right and left halves of the lower jaw connected\r\nby an elastic band._\r\n\r\nThe Snakes are the most highly specialised branch of the Sauria, from which\r\nthey do not differ in any fundamental characters. The chief modifications\r\nconsist in the absence of the limbs and limb-girdles (a feature intimately\r\ncorrelated with the much-elongated body), and in the swallowing apparatus.\r\nThe reduction of the limbs and the elongation of the body also occurs in\r\nmany Lacertilia; in several of the older families of Snakes (_e.g._\r\nTyphlopidae and Boidae) vestiges of the hind-limbs and even of the pelvis\r\nare still in existence. Even the peculiar suspensorial apparatus of the\r\nlower jaw approaches that of the Lacertilia in the burrowing Ilysiidae and\r\nin _Xenopeltis_.\r\n\r\nIn the majority of the Snakes the quadrate is very loosely suspended from\r\nthe squamosal (by some authorities homologised with the supratemporal bone\r\nof other reptiles), and this again is loosely attached to the lateral\r\nparietal region of the skull, placed horizontally, and elongated so far\r\nbackwards that the vertically placed quadrate lies in a plane behind the\r\nskull. In most Snakes the elongated pterygoids are loosely attached to the\r\ninner side of the distal end of the quadrates, and they also often touch\r\nthe mandibles. The whole palatal apparatus is movably attached to the\r\nskull, except in some burrowing families. The right and left pterygoids and\r\npalatines are widely separated from each other. The pterygoids and\r\nmaxillaries, connected by the ectopterygoids, are absent, owing to\r\nreduction, in the {582}Typhlopidae and Glauconiidae only. The premaxilla is\r\nunpaired and small, and is rarely furnished with teeth. The latter are\r\nalways sharp and recurved, and are lodged in sockets upon the edge of the\r\nsupporting bone, with which they become firmly ankylosed. There is a\r\nperpetual succession of teeth. In the majority of Snakes teeth are carried\r\nby the maxillaries, palatines, pterygoids, and dentaries, rarely by the\r\npremaxillaries. The palatal teeth are restricted to the palatines in\r\n_Oligodon_, _Dasypeltis_, and _Atractaspis_ only.\r\n\r\nPeculiar modifications prevail in the poisonous Snakes. Those maxillary\r\nteeth which are at their base in connexion with the openings of\r\npoison-glands (modified upper labial glands), either have a furrow on the\r\nanterior side (Proteroglypha if the anterior teeth are grooved, _e.g._ the\r\nCobras; Opisthoglypha if some of the posterior teeth are grooved), or the\r\ngroove is converted into a canal, as in the Solenoglypha or Viperidae. The\r\nspecial modification of the maxillaries of the vipers with their long\r\npoison-fangs is described on pp. 587 and 637.\r\n\r\nThe orbit is generally closed behind by the postfrontal. Quadrato-jugal,\r\npostfronto-squamosal, and other arches are absent, so that the temporal\r\nfossa is quite open (see Fig. 156, p. 597, and Fig. 155, p. 596). The\r\noccipital condyle is distinctly triple. The mandibles are composed of\r\nseveral bones, but the coronoid is absent in the Xenopeltidae, Colubridae,\r\nAmblycephalidae, and Viperidae; it is large in the Boidae, reduced to a\r\nnodule in the Ilysiidae.\r\n\r\nThe parietals are always fused into a large unpaired bone, which generally\r\nforms a sharp crest and partly overlaps the occipitals; there is no\r\ninterparietal or pineal foramen.\r\n\r\nThe vertebral column consists of many, often nearly three hundred\r\nvertebrae, and these skeletal segments correspond in number with those of\r\nthe ventral and transverse scales of the skin. The vertebrae are\r\nprocoelous; in addition to the anterior and posterior zygapophyses they\r\nhave a pair of accessory articulations on the neural arches, dorsally to\r\nthe zygapophyses;–the \"zygantrum\" carried by the posterior end of the\r\nneural arches, its articular surfaces looking upwards; and the \"zygosphene\"\r\ncarried by the anterior end and looking downwards. Such accessory\r\narticulations occur also in a few Lizards, _e.g._ Iguanidae. The vertebrae\r\nof many Snakes have unpaired vertical, blade-like {583}haemapophyses on\r\ntheir centra for the more effective attachment of the muscles. All the\r\nvertebrae, except the atlas, carry ribs. These articulate by their\r\ncapitular portions only, and are very movable in a head- and tail-ward\r\ndirection. The ribs being long, and fitting with their ventral ends into\r\nthe connective tissue of the sides of the ventral transverse scales, are\r\nthe principal agents in pushing the body forwards, the posterior edges of\r\nthese scales being sharp and imbricating.\r\n\r\nThe skin is covered with scales, absolutely devoid of osteoderms. When the\r\nscales are enlarged they are called shields. The keel, a common feature, is\r\ncaused by a slight ridge of the cutaneous part of the scale. The whole skin\r\nis covered with a thin layer of horny epidermis, which is shed frequently,\r\nat least several times in one year; the shedding begins at the lips, and\r\nthe whole outer skin is turned inside out from head to tail, retaining\r\nevery minute detail of the cutaneous scales; even the watch-glass-like\r\ncovering of the eyes is preserved.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are peculiar in so far as they possess no lids. The latter are\r\nstill present in a vestigial condition in the embryo, but their place is\r\ntaken by what is probably a modification of the nictitating membrane, which\r\nis drawn over the eye and covered with a single transparent scale of the\r\nhorny skin, like a watch-glass. The eyes themselves are quite movable. The\r\n\"tears,\" which of course cannot appear on the outside, are drained off into\r\nthe nasal cavities by the naso-lacrymal ducts.\r\n\r\nThe ear is likewise peculiar. There is a long columellar rod with a fibrous\r\nor cartilaginous pad at the outer end, which plays against the middle of\r\nthe shaft of the quadrate, an arrangement which, we must assume, produces a\r\nthundering noise in the internal ear, since every motion of the quadrate\r\nduring the act of swallowing conveys the vibrations directly to the\r\nfenestra ovalis. The tympanic cavity, the Eustachian tubes, and the\r\ntympanum are abolished, and no external traces of the ear are visible.\r\nHowever, in spite of all this, Snakes can hear very well.\r\n\r\nThe nose is well developed, and many Snakes, for instance the Grass-Snake,\r\nare guided to their prey as much by the sense of smell as by the eyes and\r\nears. The tongue is slender, very protractile and bifid, always moist, and\r\nfurnished with many sensory corpuscles. It acts entirely as an additional\r\nsense-organ, hence the incessant play of the tongue of a snake which wants\r\n{584}to investigate anything. In spite of the protractility of the tongue,\r\nthe hyoid apparatus is very small; the hyoid arches themselves are reduced\r\nto mere vestiges near the base of the first and only branchial arches,\r\nwhich are thread-like and extend backwards down the throat.\r\n\r\nThe trachea is very long, and opens far forwards in the mouth; it can be\r\nslightly protruded between the two halves of the lower jaw so as not to be\r\nblocked during the act of swallowing. This is a laborious process. The\r\nsnake, having got hold of its prey with its teeth, generally shifts it into\r\nthe most convenient position, in order to swallow the head first. One half\r\nof the mandible is then pushed forwards, then the other half; the recurved\r\nteeth afford the necessary hold, and the snake, little by little, draws its\r\nmouth-cavity, and later on itself, over the prey. In fact, it literally\r\ngets outside it. Sometimes with a large victim this process may last for\r\nhours; the whole mouth and head become painfully distended and the veins\r\nswollen almost to bursting. The snake pushes the prey against a stone or\r\nother obstacle, rests awhile quite exhausted, and begins afresh. At last\r\nthe bulk of the prey has passed the mouth, the skin of the neck is\r\nstretched to the utmost, the scales being separated by wide interstices,\r\nthe ribs work spasmodically, the victim is pressed into the shape of a\r\nsausage, and the deed is done. In order to assist deglutition there is a\r\ngreat amount of salivation, but the often-heard story that Snakes cover\r\ntheir prey with saliva before they swallow it, is a fable, or based upon\r\nfaulty observation, snakes sometimes being forced to disgorge the\r\nhalf-swallowed prey, which, in such a case, is covered with slime. One of\r\nmy tame snakes had swallowed a frog on my table when a friend entered the\r\nroom. The snake was frightened, jumped on to the ground, striking it with\r\nits full belly, and thereby hurting the frog, which squeaked loudly,\r\nwhereupon the snake reversed its mechanism and the frog hopped away, none\r\nthe worse for its terrible experience.\r\n\r\nIn correlation with the elongated narrow space of the body-cavity the lungs\r\nare not equally developed, the right being much smaller than the left. The\r\nlatter is a very thin-walled, hollow bag, and the posterior half or third\r\nscarcely contains any of the honey-comb-like respiratory \"cells,\" but acts\r\nmerely as a reservoir of air.\r\n\r\n{585}The cloacal arrangement is essentially the same as that of the\r\nLacertilia, but Snakes possess no urinary bladder. The copulatory organs\r\nare stowed away beneath the skin in recesses of the posterior lateral\r\ncorners of the shallow cloacal vestibulum. Each organ is generally\r\nbifurcated at the free end, and furnished with little spike-shaped, but\r\nscarcely horny, excrescences. On each side of the outer cloacal chamber, in\r\nboth sexes, lies a roundish gland with an offensive, strongly-scented\r\nsecretion; that of various Boas smells disagreeably sweet and musky. The\r\nmajority of Snakes lay eggs, but most of the Viperidae and the thoroughly\r\naquatic kinds, besides a few terrestrial forms, are viviparous. The\r\negg-shells are like parchment, with very little or no calcareous deposit,\r\nso that they are always soft; many embryos are, however, provided with a\r\nlittle \"egg-tooth\" on the tip of the snout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.–Map showing the distribution of dangerously\r\npoisonous snakes.]\r\n\r\nSnakes are intelligent creatures; some become quite affectionate in\r\ncaptivity, but most of them are of a morose disposition, and do not care\r\nfor company.\r\n\r\nThe GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION of Snakes has been dealt with in detail in\r\nconnexion with the various families. Unfortunately very few fossils are\r\nknown. One of the oldest is _Palaeophis_, of the London clay (Lower\r\nEocene). Remains of Elapine and of innocuous Colubrine snakes have been\r\nfound in the Lower Miocene of Germany; Crotaline forms are known from the\r\nMiocene of Turkey and North America. All the Plistocene {586}remains belong\r\nto recent genera. There are indications that the Ophidia are a relatively\r\nyoung branch of Reptilia, essentially of Tertiary date, but the foundations\r\nof the distribution of most of the older families were laid in Miocene\r\ntimes. The older families, notably those which still possess vestiges of\r\nhind-limbs or of the pelvis, are circumtropical, _e.g._ Typhlopidae,\r\nBoidae. The few survivors of the Glauconiidae are likewise circumtropical,\r\nwith the exception of Australia. The Ilysiidae occur in South-Eastern Asia\r\nand in tropical South America; their offshoot the Uropeltidae are\r\nrestricted to India and Ceylon. The Colubridae and even many of their\r\nsub-families are cosmopolitan. It is quite possible that the Opisthoglypha\r\nand Proteroglypha are not natural groups, but that their respective\r\nconditions have been developed on various occasions and in different\r\ncountries. The same applies more strongly to the Viperidae, a further\r\ndevelopment of the Opisthoglyphous type. To judge from their distribution,\r\nthe Crotaline snakes were possibly developed in the Palaearctic sub-region;\r\nthey spread all over America, but they were debarred from entering either\r\nAustralia or Africa. The Viperidae, on the other hand, are restricted\r\nentirely to the Palaeotropical region and to the Palaearctic sub-region.\r\nThe fact that no separating belt of water existed for them between Europe\r\nand Africa, indicates their being the most recently developed of poisonous\r\nsnakes. Madagascar is the only large country which, besides snakeless New\r\nZealand, enjoys a total absence of poisonous snakes of any kind, while the\r\nOriental is the only sub-region which suffers from the presence of numerous\r\nspecies of every sub-family of poisonous Elapine, Crotaline, and Viperine\r\nsnakes.\r\n\r\n_Snake-Poison._–Many Snakes, belonging to different families, are\r\npoisonous, and unfortunately there is no external character, easily\r\nascertained, by which every poisonous snake can be distinguished from a\r\nharmless kind. If the head is very broad, this is probably due to the pair\r\nof poison-glands on the sides of the head; but many harmless snakes can\r\nflatten and broaden their heads in a suspicious way, and, what is much\r\nworse, many of the most poisonous snakes, for instance the Cobras, have a\r\nhead as smooth and as sleek-looking as the Grass- or Ring-Snake, the most\r\nharmless of species. It so happens that, with a few exceptions, for\r\ninstance among the Crotalines and Vipers, no {587}badly poisonous snake has\r\nloreal shields, _i.e._ a pair of shields intercalated between the nasals\r\nand the preoculars, but this character is obviously no good for any\r\npractical purposes. Therefore, unless you know a snake well enough when you\r\nsee it, leave it alone, because a mistake may be fatal.\r\n\r\nThe poison is secreted in modified upper labial glands, or in a pair of\r\nlarge glands which are the homologues of the parotid salivary glands of\r\nother animals.[174] A duct passes from the gland forwards along the side of\r\nthe upper jaw. Just in front of the fang it doubles on itself, so as to\r\nopen by a small papilla on the anterior wall of the sheath of mucous\r\nmembrane which embraces the base of the tooth like a pocket. As mentioned\r\nbefore (p. 582), the poison is conveyed either along a furrow on the\r\nanterior side of the tooth, or the growing substance of the tooth partly\r\nconverts the furrow into a canal which opens only near the end of the\r\ntooth. This is a perfectly devilish contrivance, ensuring the conveyance of\r\nthe poison into the very deepest part of the wound. The Elapinae have\r\nrelatively short fangs, while those of the Vipers, and especially those of\r\nthe Crotaline snakes, are much longer, sometimes measuring nearly an inch\r\nin length. The most formidable apparatus is that of the Viperidae, since in\r\nthem the maxillaries, each provided with only one acting fang, and without\r\nany other teeth behind, can be erected. The mechanism is explained in Fig.\r\n154 and Fig. 179 (p. 647). The apparatus of the upper jaw is so constructed\r\nthat the pushing forwards of the horizontal pterygoid bar will, by acting\r\non the ectopterygoid, rotate and erect the short maxillary. The pulling\r\nforwards is effected by contraction of the spheno-pterygoid muscle, which\r\narises far forwards from the basal orbito-sphenoid region, and is inserted\r\non to the inner dorsal surface of the pterygoid. The principal closing\r\nmuscles of the mouth are the temporo-masseteric muscles (Fig. 179, _T.a._\r\nand _T.p._) and the inner and outer pterygoid muscles, which latter arise\r\nfrom the outer surface of the pterygoid bone, or from the maxillary, and\r\nare inserted on to the articular region of the mandible.\r\n\r\nA strong ligament arises from the squamoso-quadrate junction, and spreads\r\nfan-shaped upon the connective tissue {588}wall of the poison-gland; the\r\nanterior and posterior ends of the gland are held by another strong band,\r\nwhich stretches from the maxilla to the mandibular joint. The whole is so\r\narranged that the acts of opening the jaws (by the digastric muscles) and\r\nthe erection of the fang-bearing maxillaries are enough to mechanically\r\nsqueeze the contents out of the poison-gland. A portion of the anterior\r\ntemporal muscle is attached to the capsule of the poison-gland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.–Explanation of the biting mechanism of a\r\nrattlesnake. _Ia_ and _Ib_, position of the apparatus when the mouth is\r\nshut. _IIa_ and _IIb_, position of the apparatus when the mouth is opened\r\nwidely; the spheno-pterygoid muscle (_P.e_) is contracted, the pterygoid\r\n(_Pt_) is pulled forwards, the transverse bone or ectopterygoid (_Tr_)\r\npushes the maxillary (_M_), rotates it and thereby causes the poison-fang\r\n(_J_) to assume an erect position. _Di_, Digastric muscle, contraction of\r\nwhich lowers, or opens, the lower jaw; _G_, the groove or pit\r\ncharacteristic of the Crotaline snakes; _J_, poison-fang; _M_, maxillary;\r\n_P_, palatine; _P.e_, spheno-pterygoid muscle; _Pm_, premaxillary; _Pt_,\r\npterygoid; _Q_, quadrate; _Sq_, squamosal; _T.a_, insertion of the anterior\r\ntemporal muscle, by contraction of which the mouth is shut; cf.

Martin.[175] The following condensed account\r\nhas been abstracted from it:–\r\n\r\n\"The poison is a clear, pale yellow, or straw-coloured fluid, {589}which\r\nreacts acid, and contains about 30 per cent of solids, but this varies much\r\naccording to the state of concentration. Most venoms are tasteless, but\r\nCobra poison is said to be disagreeably bitter. Dried venom keeps\r\nindefinitely, and dissolves readily in water. It keeps also in glycerine.\r\nIt contains albuminous bodies in solution. The venom is, in fact, a pure\r\nsolution of two or more poisonous proteids, which are the active agents,\r\nwith a small quantity of an organic acid or colouring matter. The venom is\r\ndestroyed by reagents which precipitate proteids in an insoluble form, or\r\nwhich destroy them, _e.g._ silver nitrate or permanganate of potash.\r\nHypochlorites have the same effect. Carbolic acid and caustic potash\r\ndestroy it only after a day or two.\r\n\r\n\"The venom is generally introduced into the subcutaneous tissue, whence it\r\nreaches the general circulation by absorption through the lymph and\r\nblood-vessels. When introduced directly into a vein, the effects are\r\ninstantaneous. It is absorbed by the conjunctiva, but, excepting Cobra\r\npoison, not by the mouth or alimentary canal, provided there be no hollow\r\nteeth or no abrasions. The venom of the various kinds of Snakes acts\r\ndifferently.\r\n\r\n\"The symptoms of Cobra poison. Burning pain, followed by sleepiness, and\r\nweakness in the legs after half an hour. Then profuse salivation, paralysis\r\nof the tongue and larynx, and inability to speak. Vomiting. Incapability of\r\nmovement. The patient seems to be conscious, but is unable to express\r\nhimself. The breathing becomes difficult. The heart's action is quickened.\r\nThe pupil remains contracted and reacts to light. At length breathing\r\nceases, with or without convulsions, and the heart slowly stops. Should the\r\npatient survive, he returns rapidly to complete health.\r\n\r\n\"The symptoms of Rattle-snake poison. The painful wound is speedily\r\ndiscoloured and swollen. Constitutional symptoms appear as a rule in less\r\nthan fifteen minutes: prostration, staggering, cold sweats, vomiting,\r\nfeeble and quick pulse, dilatation of the pupil, and slight mental\r\ndisturbance. In this state the patient may die in about twelve hours. If he\r\nrecovers from the depression, the local symptoms begin to play a much more\r\nimportant part than in Cobra poisoning: great swelling and discoloration\r\nextending up the limb and trunk, rise of {590}temperature and repeated\r\nsyncope, and laboured respiration. Death may occur in this stage. The local\r\nhaemorrhagic extravasation frequently suppurates, or becomes gangrenous,\r\nand from this the patient may die even weeks afterwards. Recovery is\r\nsudden, and within a few hours the patient becomes bright and intelligent.\r\n\r\n\"Symptoms of bite from the European Viper. Local burning pain; the bitten\r\nlimb soon swells and is discoloured. Great prostration, vomiting, and cold,\r\nclammy perspiration follow within one to three hours. The pulse is very\r\nfeeble, with slight difficulty in breathing, and restlessness. In severe\r\ncases the pulse may become imperceptible, the extremities may become cold,\r\nand the patient may pass into coma. In from twelve to twenty-four hours\r\nthese severe constitutional symptoms usually pass off, but in the meantime\r\nthe swelling and discoloration have spread enormously. Within a few days\r\nrecovery usually occurs somewhat suddenly, but death may occur from the\r\nsevere depression, or from the secondary effects of suppuration.\r\n\r\n\"Symptoms of bite from the Daboia or _Vipera russelli_. These resemble the\r\neffects of Rattle-snake poison, but sanious discharges from the rectum,\r\netc., are an additional and prominent feature. The recovering patient\r\nsuffers from haemorrhagic extravasations in various organs, besides from\r\nthe lungs, nose, mouth, and bowels. Kidney haemorrhage and albuminuria is a\r\nconstant symptom. The pupil is always dilated and insensitive to light.\r\n\r\n\"Symptoms of bite of Australian Elapine snakes. Pain and local swelling.\r\nThe first constitutional symptoms appear in fifteen minutes to two hours.\r\nFirst faintness, and an irresistible desire to sleep. Then alarming\r\nprostration and vomiting. The pulse is extremely feeble and thread-like,\r\nand uncountable. The limbs are cold, and the skin is blanched. Respiration\r\nbecomes shallow with the increasing coma. Sensation is blunted. The pupil\r\nis widely dilated, and insensible to light. There is sometimes passing of\r\nblood. If the patient survives the coma, recovery is complete and as a rule\r\nrapid, without secondary symptoms. The Australian venom and that of all\r\nviperine snakes, perhaps also that of the Cobra, if introduced rapidly into\r\nthe circulation, occasions extensive intravascular clotting. If the venom\r\nis slowly absorbed, the blood loses its coagulability, {591}owing to the\r\nbreaking down of the red blood-corpuscles, most so with vipers, less with\r\nAustralian snakes, least so with the Cobra. The Cobra venom is supposed to\r\nextinguish the functions of the various nerve-centres of the cerebro-spinal\r\nsystem, the paralysation extending from below upwards, and it has a special\r\naffinity for the respiratory centre. The toxicity or relative strength of\r\nthe Cobra venom has been calculated to be sixteen times that of the\r\nEuropean Viper. Snakes can poison each other, even those of the same kind.\r\n\r\n\"_Treatment._–Apply a ligature above, not on the top of the situation of\r\nthe bite; twist the string tightly with a stick. Then make a free incision\r\ninto the wound. Sucking out is dangerous! Then bandage the limb downwards,\r\nprogressing towards the wound; repeat this several times. Direct\r\napplication into the widened wound of calcium hypochlorite, i.e. bleaching\r\npowder, is very good, or of a 1 per cent solution of permanganate of\r\npotash, or Condy's fluid. Amputation of the finger is the best remedy of\r\nall if a large snake has bitten it. Do not keep the ligature longer than\r\nhalf an hour. Then let the circulation return, and apply the ligature\r\nagain. In any case, do not keep the ligature on for more than one hour for\r\nfear of gangrene.\r\n\r\n\"_Internal remedies._–The administration of enormous doses of alcohol is to\r\nbe condemned strongly; small stimulating doses are good, but stimulation\r\ncan be more effectively produced by ammonia or strychnia. Hypodermic\r\ninjection of strychnine, in some cases as much as one to two grains (but\r\nnot into a vein!) has in some cases had good results; but injection of\r\nammonia, instead of doing any good, has disastrous sloughing results. There\r\nis only one fairly reliable treatment, that by serum therapeutics, the\r\ninjection of considerable quantities of serum of animals which have been\r\npartially immunised by repeated doses of snake-venom. Unfortunately this\r\ntreatment will not often be available.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral well-known Mammals and Birds are immune by nature against\r\nsnake-venom, but most of them avoid being bitten. Some birds induce the\r\nsnake to strike and bite frequently into their spread-out wings. Such more\r\nor less immune creatures are the Mongoose, the Hedgehog, and the Pig, the\r\nSecretary bird, the Honey Buzzard, the Stork and probably other\r\nsnake-eaters.\r\n\r\n{592}CLASSIFICATION OF OPHIDIA.–Duméril and Bibron[176] divided Snakes\r\naccording to their teeth into Opotérodonts, Aglyphodonts, Solenoglypha,\r\nProteroglypha, and Opisthoglypha.\r\n\r\nJ. E. Gray[177] divided Snakes into two sub-orders: Viperina and\r\nColubrinia. Günther[178] distinguished between Ophidii colubriformes, O.\r\ncolubriformes venenosi (Elapidae and Hydrophidae) and O. viperiformes.\r\nCope[179] laid stress upon the modifications of the squamosal,\r\nectopterygoid, and ectopterygoid bones, and also upon the condition of the\r\nvestigial limbs. He divided the snakes into Scolecophidia (Typhlopidae),\r\nCatodonta, Tortricina, Asinea (the harmless snakes without limb-vestiges),\r\nProteroglypha, and Solenoglypha.\r\n\r\nBoulenger[180] has accepted Cope's principles, and, mainly by combining the\r\nAsinea with the Proteroglypha as Colubridae, has produced a logically\r\nconceived system, by far the best hitherto proposed. It has been followed\r\nin the present work. Boulenger's phylogenetic system stands as follows:–\r\n\r\n                        9 Viperidae\r\n  5 Uropeltidae               |                        8 Amblycephalidae\r\n        |        7_a_ C.

The\r\nfollowing characterisation of families may therefore be preferred:–\r\n\r\n  Eyes vestigial; no teeth in the lower jaw; without enlarged ventral\r\n  scales. .......... _Typhlopidae._\r\n\r\n  Eyes vestigial; teeth restricted to the lower jaw; without enlarged\r\n  ventral scales. .......... _Glauconiidae._\r\n\r\n  Eyes very small; head not distinct; ventral scales scarcely enlarged;\r\n  tail extremely short, ending obtusely and covered with peculiar scales.\r\n  .......... _Uropeltidae._\r\n\r\n  With vestiges of the hind-limbs appearing as claw-like spurs on each side\r\n  of the vent; ventral scales transversely enlarged; eyes functional, free.\r\n\r\n    Ventral scales scarcely enlarged. .......... _Ilysiidae._\r\n\r\n    Ventral scales transversely enlarged. .......... _Boidae._\r\n\r\n  With a pair of poison-fangs in the front part of the mouth, carried by\r\n  the otherwise toothless, much shortened, and vertically erectile\r\n  maxillaries; ventral scales transversely enlarged; eyes free. ..........\r\n  _Viperidae._\r\n\r\n  All the remaining Snakes combine the following characters: the\r\n  maxillaries are typical, not separately movable, horizontal, with a\r\n  series of teeth.[181] The mandible is toothed but has no coronoid bone.\r\n  There are no vestiges of limbs or of their girdles. The eyes are free.\r\n\r\n    Dentary movably attached to the tip of the articular bone of the\r\n    mandible; skin beautifully iridescent. .......... _Xenopeltidae._\r\n\r\n    Without a mental groove; the ends of the pterygoids are free, not\r\n    reaching the quadrates. .......... _Amblycephalidae._\r\n\r\n    With a median longitudinal groove between the shields of the chin; the\r\n    squamosal is horizontally elongated, movable; the pterygoid reaches the\r\n    quadrate. .......... _Colubridae._\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. TYPHLOPIDAE.–Burrowing snakes which have the whole body covered\r\nwith uniform cycloid scales, and with the teeth restricted to the small and\r\ntransversely placed maxillary bones. The pterygoids do not extend backwards\r\nto the quadrates, and there are no endopterygoids. The quadrates slant\r\nobliquely forwards, and are attached directly to the pro-otics, {594}owing\r\nto the absence of squamosal bones. The prefrontals are in lateral contact\r\nwith the nasals. There are vestiges of the pelvis, reduced to a single bone\r\non each side. The eyes are hidden by shields of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe Typhlopidae, mainly composed of the genus _Typhlops_, with about one\r\nhundred species, are undoubtedly the last living descendants of formerly\r\ncosmopolitan, rather archaic, snakes, which in adaptation to their\r\nburrowing life and insectivorous diet have undergone degradation. They are\r\nstill widely distributed in all tropical and sub-tropical countries, some\r\non the solitary Christmas Island, but not in New Zealand. One species, _T.\r\nvermicularis_, inhabits the Balkan Peninsula and South-West Asia. It is\r\nbrown above, yellowish below, and reaches a length of about 10 inches. The\r\ntail is extremely short and ends in a horny spine. _T. braminus_ is widely\r\ndistributed in Southern Asia, the Malay Islands, the islands in the Indian\r\nOcean and in Southern Africa.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. GLAUCONIIDAE.–In most respects resembling the Typhlopidae, but the\r\nmaxillaries retain their normal position and are toothless, teeth being\r\nrestricted to the lower jaw, which is stout and short. The pelvic girdle\r\nand the hind-limbs show the least reduction found in any recent Snakes; in\r\nthe pelvis the ilia, pubes, and ischia can still be distinguished, the last\r\neven retaining their symphysis; there are also vestiges of femurs. About\r\nthirty species, nearly all belonging to the genus _Glauconia_, are found in\r\nSouth-Western Asia, Africa, and the warmer parts of America, including the\r\nWest Indies.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. ILYSIIDAE.–The scales of the cylindrical body are smooth and small,\r\nthose on the ventral side are scarcely larger. The tail is extremely short\r\nand blunt. The head is very small, not distinct from the neck. The gape of\r\nthe mouth is very narrow. Teeth are carried by the mandibles, the\r\npterygoids, palatines, maxillaries, and one or two or more by the\r\npremaxillae. The endopterygoids are short. An important cranial feature is\r\nthe short quadrates, which stand rather vertically and are connected with\r\nthe cranium by the squamosals; these are very small and are firmly wedged\r\nin between the upper ends of the quadrates and the pro-otic, lateral, and\r\nsupra-occipital bones; now forming part of the cranial wall. Vestiges of\r\nthe pelvis and hind-limbs are very incomplete, and terminate in claw-like\r\nspurs, {595}protruding between the scales on either side of the vent. The\r\neyes are very small, and are either free or covered by transparent shields.\r\nThe few, scarcely half-a-dozen, species are found in South America\r\n(_Ilysia_) and in Ceylon, the Malay Islands, and Indo-China.\r\n\r\n_Ilysia_ (_Tortrix_) _scytale_, the Coral-Snake of Tropical South America,\r\nis a beautiful coral-red with black rings. On account of its beauty,\r\nperfectly harmless nature, and for \"cooling purposes,\" this snake, which\r\ngrows to nearly a yard in length, is sometimes worn as a necklace by native\r\nladies. All the Ilysiidae lead a partly burrowing life, live chiefly upon\r\nworms, insects, and little Typhlopidae, and are viviparous.\r\n\r\nFAM. 4. UROPELTIDAE.–Burrowing snakes of Ceylon and Southern India, with a\r\nshort and rigid cylindrical body and a very short tail, which ends in a\r\nlarge peculiar shield, often obliquely truncated. The scales of the body\r\nare smooth, and are little larger on the belly; the coloration is mostly\r\nvery beautiful. The eyes are very small.\r\n\r\nThe Uropeltidae are somewhat intermediate between the Ilysiidae,\r\nGlauconiidae, and Boidae. The pterygoids do not reach the quadrates; but\r\nectopterygoids are present; the quadrates are very small and directly\r\nattached to the skull, squamosals being absent. Teeth are carried by the\r\nmandibles and by the maxillaries, which are normal in their position. There\r\nare no vestiges of hind-limbs or of the pelvis. The Uropeltidae, of which\r\nabout forty species are known, are viviparous, burrow in the ground, and\r\nfrequent damp localities, preferring mountain-forests. The use of the\r\ncharacteristic tail-shield is not clear; perhaps it assists these rather\r\nrigid creatures in digging, by being pressed against the ground.\r\n\r\n_Uropeltis._–The tail is obliquely truncated, ending in a roundish, flat\r\nshield.\r\n\r\n_U. grandis_ s. _philippinus_.–The latter name seems to have misled W.\r\nMarshall[182] into including the Philippine Islands in the range of the\r\nfamily, a mistake which is sure to be propagated. The species, the only one\r\nof the genus, is confined to Ceylon; it is blackish above, yellow below,\r\nfrequently with small yellow spots above and brown spots on the under\r\nsurface. It grows to about 18 inches in length.\r\n\r\n{596}_Rhinophis._–The tail-shield is convex and the snout is pointed. _Rh.\r\nsanguineus_ of Southern India is black above with a bluish gloss, sometimes\r\nwith small pale specks; the belly and several of the lateral series of\r\nscales are bright red, spotted with black. The tail-shield is black and\r\nred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155.–Skull of _Eunectes murinus_. × 1.

BOIDAE.–Typical Snakes, usually large, and with vestiges of pelvis\r\nand hind-limbs, appearing externally as claw-like spurs on each side of the\r\nvent. The scales of the upper surface are usually small and smooth, while\r\nthose of the ventral surface form one broad series on the belly, and one or\r\ntwo rows on the tail. The quadrate is carried by the horizontally elongated\r\nsquamosal, which rests loosely upon the lateral occipital region. The\r\nprefrontal is in contact with the nasal. Teeth are carried by the\r\nmandibles, the pterygoids, palatines, maxillaries, and, in the Pythoninae,\r\nby the premaxillaries also. For further details see Figs. 155, 156.\r\n\r\n{597}[Illustration: FIG. 156.–A, Ventral, B, dorsal, view of the skull of\r\n_Eunectes murinus_. Lettering as in Fig. 155. × 1.]\r\n\r\nThe Boidae comprise between sixty and seventy species, which have been\r\ngrouped into many genera, on unimportant characters, referring to the\r\nscales and shields of the head. It is doubtful if they are natural groups,\r\na consideration which detracts much from their value in the study of\r\ngeographical distribution. Even the two sub-families are not free from this\r\nreproach. The range of the family is world-wide, Boidae occurring in all\r\ntropical and sub-tropical countries, including islands, except New Zealand.\r\nA few species live in South-Eastern Europe (_Eryx_) and in North-Western\r\nAmerica. They mostly prefer wooded districts, especially forests; climbing\r\ntrees, assisted by the short and partly prehensile tail. Others are\r\nsemi-aquatic, and a few live in sandy localities. They are all rapacious,\r\nand by preference feed on warm-blooded creatures, which they constrict by\r\ncoils of the body in order to hold, kill, and crush the victim before\r\nswallowing it. Exaggerated notions are entertained about their swallowing\r\ncapacity. It is obvious that a large snake, 20 feet long, half a foot\r\nthick, and weighing several hundred pounds, can crush a tiger, a stag, or\r\neven a {598}cow; but common sense tells us where to draw the line when it\r\ncomes to the swallowing of the prey. Small game, although of a bulk\r\napparently far too big for the snake, is so crushed and mangled that it is\r\nturned into the shape of a sausage preparatory to the long process of\r\nswallowing. The Boidae lay eggs, and some species incubate them, or rather\r\nthe female coils herself round them for the sake of protection. No\r\nappreciable amount of extra warmth is developed. Unfortunately the\r\nobservations of one of the best cases on record[183] were conducted so\r\nimperfectly that they are of little value.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. PYTHONINAE.–With a pair of supra-orbital bones, intercalated\r\nbetween the prefrontal, frontal, and postfrontal bones. The sub-caudal\r\nscales are mostly in two rows. The premaxilla often carries a few small\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nThe Pythoninae, comprising about twenty species, are restricted to the\r\nPalaeotropical and Australian regions, with the sole exception of\r\n_Loxocemus bicolor_ in Southern Mexico.\r\n\r\n_Python_, the principal genus, has teeth on the premaxilla. The rostral,\r\neach of the anterior upper labials, and some of the lower labial shields,\r\ncontain a deep, probably sensory, pit. The maxillary and mandibular teeth\r\nare long, but decrease from before backwards. The head is distinct from the\r\nneck, and is covered with symmetrical shields or with small scales. The\r\nscales of the body are small and smooth. The tail is short and prehensile;\r\nbelow with two rows of scales. The pupil of the eye is vertical. The range\r\nof the genus extends over the whole of the Palaeotropical and Australian\r\nregions, excepting Madagascar and New Zealand.\r\n\r\n_P. spilotes_, the \"Carpet Snake\" of Australia and New Guinea, is mostly\r\nbeautifully marked, but is subject to much variation in colour. The more\r\ntypical specimens are black above, each scale with a yellowish dot, with\r\nyellow spots or combinations of dots, more or less arranged in rows. The\r\nunder parts are yellow. It reaches a length of about two yards, and spends\r\na great part of its time in trees.\r\n\r\n_P. reticulatus_ is the commonest species in Indo-China and in the Malay\r\nIslands. Four upper labial shields of each side are pitted. The specific\r\nname refers to the bold, dark, lozenge-shaped markings upon the lighter\r\nyellowish or brown ground. A black {599}line extends over the head from the\r\nnose to the neck, and another on each side from the eye to the angle of the\r\nmouth. The under parts are mostly yellowish, with small brown spots on the\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the largest species of Python, some specimens being known\r\nwhich measured about 30 feet in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 157.–_Python spilotes_ (the Carpet Snake). × ⅛.]\r\n\r\nAs a sample of folk-lore connected with this monstrous snake the following\r\nBurmese fable has been recorded by Mason:–[184]\r\n\r\n\"According to a Karen legend all the poisonous serpents derive their\r\nvirulence from the Python, which, though innocuous now, was originally the\r\nonly one that was venomous. In those days he was perfectly white, but\r\nhaving seduced away a man's wife, Aunt Eu (Eve), he made her, while she was\r\nin his den, weave figures on his skin in the forms which are now seen. At\r\nthat time, if he bit the footstep of a man in the road, such was the\r\nvirulence of his poison that the man died, how far soever that man might\r\nhave passed from the bitten track. The Python had not, however, an ocular\r\ndemonstration of the fact, so he said to the Crow: 'Crow, go and see\r\nwhether people die or not when I bite the foot-track.' The Crow went to the\r\nneighbourhood of a Karen cabin, and found the people, as is their custom at\r\nfunerals, laughing, singing, dancing, jumping, and beating drums. He\r\ntherefore returned to the Python, and told him that so far from {600}his\r\nefforts producing death, on the contrary they produced joy. The Python was\r\nso angry when he heard this that he ascended a tree and spit up all his\r\nvenom, but other creeping things came and swallowed it, and people die of\r\ntheir malignancy to this day. The tree, therefore, from which the Python\r\nspat up his venom became deadly, and its juice is used to this day for the\r\npurpose of poisoning arrows. The Python made the other creatures promise\r\nnot to bite without provocation. The Cobra said: 'If there be transgression\r\nso as to dazzle my eyes, to make my tears fall seven times in one day, I\r\nwill bite.' So said the Tiger (whose bite the Karens esteem as virulent as\r\na serpent's) and others, and they were allowed to retain their poison. But\r\nthe Water Snake and Frog said they would bite with or without cause as they\r\nliked; so the Python drove them into the water, where their poison melted\r\naway and their bite became harmless.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 158.–_Python molurus._ × ⅒.]\r\n\r\n_P. molurus_ is the species of India and Ceylon, ranging, however, also\r\ninto Indo-China. Boulenger quotes W. Elliot[185] {601}as the authority for\r\nthe statement that this species grows to the length of 30 feet. Only two\r\npairs of upper labials are pitted. The general colour above is greyish or\r\nyellowish brown with a dorsal series of large reddish-brown, black-edged\r\npatches, and on the sides of the body with a series of smaller spots with\r\nlight centres. On the head is a lance-shaped marking; a brown stripe passes\r\nfrom the eye backwards. The under parts are yellowish.\r\n\r\n_P. sebae_ and _P. regius_ are African species. The former has two pairs of\r\nupper labials pitted, the latter four pairs. _P. sebae_ is generally pale\r\nbrown above with dark brown, black-edged cross-bars, which are usually\r\nconnected by a sinuous dark stripe along each side of the back. The upper\r\nsurface of the tail has a light stripe between two black stripes. The belly\r\nis spotted and dotted with dark brown. _P. sebae_ ranges over the whole of\r\nTropical and Southern Africa, perhaps with the exception of Eastern Africa.\r\n_P. regius_ of West Africa is beautifully marked, and may be recognised by\r\nthe dark brown, black-edged band along the back, sending down triangular or\r\nY-shaped processes on the sides, which are pale brown. This dorsal band\r\nencloses a light streak on the neck and another on the tail. The belly is\r\nyellowish.\r\n\r\nThese African Pythons grow to a length of about 15 feet, but specimens so\r\nlarge as this are not often met with. The negroes of certain parts of the\r\ncoast of Guinea are said to worship them and to keep them in special\r\ntemples, where they are regularly attended to. Their food consists chiefly\r\nof small Mammals, notably rats, and of Birds. A couple of these snakes\r\npaired in the Zoological Gardens of London in the month of June. The female\r\nlaid nearly one hundred eggs in the following January, and incubated them\r\nuntil April, when the embryos were found to be still unripe.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. BOINAE.–Without supra-orbital bones. The premaxilla is\r\ntoothless. The subcaudal scales form mostly a single row.\r\n\r\nThe Boinae comprise between forty and fifty species. Most of them are\r\nAmerican, but the genus _Eryx_ inhabits North Africa, Greece, and\r\nSouth-Western Asia; the genus _Enygrus_ inhabits New Guinea and many of the\r\nPacific Islands, for instance New Britain (Neu Pommern), the Solomon,\r\nLoyalty and Fiji Islands, {602}and the New Hebrides. _Casarea dussumieri_\r\nis found on Round Island near Mauritius; and two species of _Boa_ and one\r\nof _Corallus_ represent the Boidae in Madagascar, while all the others live\r\nin Central and South America.\r\n\r\n_Boa._–The maxillary and mandibular teeth gradually decrease in size. The\r\nscales of the upper parts of the body and tail are smooth and very small.\r\nThe rostral shield is enlarged. The nostrils are placed between two or\r\nthree nasals, and these are separated from those of the other side by small\r\nscales. The tail is short and prehensile. The pupil is vertical.\r\n\r\n_B. constrictor_, of South America, has the head covered with small scales,\r\none of the pre-oculars being enlarged. The eye is separated from the\r\nlabials by several series of tiny scales. The general colour is a delicate\r\n\"pale brown above, with fifteen to twenty dark brown cross-bars widening on\r\neach side, and, if connected by a dark dorso-lateral streak, enclosing\r\nlarge elongate oval spots.... On each side is a series of large dark brown\r\nspots with light centres, most of which alternate with the cross-bars. On\r\nthe tail the markings become much larger, brick-red, edged with black, and\r\nseparated by narrow, yellowish interspaces.\" Under parts yellowish with\r\nblack dots. _Boa constrictor_, a name applied in popular parlance to many\r\nspecies, reaches a length of more than 10 feet; the largest specimen in the\r\nBritish Museum measures exactly 11 feet. A few other species inhabit\r\nCentral America and the West Indies. _B. dumerili_ and _B.\r\nmadagascariensis_, both of Madagascar, cannot be separated from the genus\r\n_Boa_.\r\n\r\nA. D. Bartlett[186] has described the following incident:–\r\n\r\n\"In the evening of 5th October 1892 two pigeons were put into the cage in\r\nwhich two fine specimens of _Boa constrictor_ had been living on friendly\r\nterms since the beginning of the year. The larger snake seized one of the\r\npigeons and the keeper left the house. The next morning only one of the\r\nsnakes, the larger specimen, was visible, and from its enormously extended\r\nbody it was evident that it had swallowed its companion, which was about 9\r\nfeet in length. It had no longer the power of curling itself round, but\r\nremained extended nearly to its full length in a straight line, and\r\nappeared to be at least three times its normal circumference. It was almost\r\npainful to see the distended skin, {603}which had separated the scales all\r\nover the middle of the body. By 2nd November, twenty-eight days later, the\r\nsnake had not only digested its companion but had regained its appetite as\r\nwell as its normal size, and it immediately swallowed a pigeon put into its\r\nden.\"\r\n\r\nThis peculiar case is not one of ordinary cannibalism. It is rather an\r\nunintentional accident. When two snakes happen to get hold of the same\r\nanimal (in the present case a pigeon) and begin to swallow it, the action\r\nof swallowing becomes almost mechanical, the snakes continuing to push\r\ntheir jaws over the prey–which in the case of a bird or mammal they cannot\r\ntaste, nor can they see it–so long as they feel something in the mouth.\r\nAfter the original prey has been mastered, it is the turn of the opposite\r\nsnake's head, and if the weaker snake does not give way it is swallowed by\r\nits stronger mate. Grass-Snakes will swallow several frogs if these are\r\ntied together in a string, and other snakes do the same with mice. There\r\nare instances on record in which a _Python_ swallowed its blanket, which,\r\nbeing absolutely indigestible, caused its death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.–Head of _Eunectes murinus_. × 1.]\r\n\r\n_Casarea_, the \"Round-Island Snake,\" differs from _Boa_ chiefly by the\r\nrough and strongly keeled scales, and by the relatively much longer tail.\r\n\r\n_Eunectes murinus_, the \"Anaconda,\" is an aquatic _Boa_. It differs from\r\nthis genus mainly by the inner of the three nasal shields being in contact\r\nwith that of the other side (see Fig. 159), and by the absence of the\r\nlittle scales between the eye and the labials; the snout is, moreover,\r\ncovered with shields instead of small scales. The pupil of the eye is\r\nnormally vertical, but it had contracted into a round pinhole in the dead\r\nbut still fresh {604}specimen from which the figure was drawn. The general\r\ncolour is dark olive-brown, with large oval black spots arranged in two\r\nmore or less alternating rows along the back, and with smaller black,\r\nwhite-eyed spots along the sides. The under parts are whitish, spotted with\r\nblack. The upper parts of this and of many other dark-coloured species of\r\nBoidae are often shiny, with an iridescent lustre.\r\n\r\nThe Anaconda combines an arboreal with an aquatic life, a kind of existence\r\neminently in harmony with the well-watered, dense forests of Tropical South\r\nAmerica, which are the home of this, the largest of all modern Snakes. It\r\nis said to attain a length of as much as 33 feet. There is no inherent\r\nimpossibility in such statements, but the giant specimens seem to have a\r\nknack of keeping out of the naturalist's way.\r\n\r\nThe Anaconda feeds chiefly upon Birds and Mammals, which it catches either\r\non land, mostly during the night-time, or in the water. For the latter\r\npurpose it lies submerged in the rivers or floats about leisurely, only the\r\nhead being above the surface, and anything suitable is attacked. In other\r\nlocalities the snake, if so inclined, establishes itself upon the branches\r\nof a tree which overhangs the water, or the track of the game. These\r\naquatic Snakes seem to be viviparous.\r\n\r\n_Eryx_ has the head not distinct from the neck and covered entirely with\r\nsmall scales. Those of the body are likewise small, and are either smooth\r\nor keeled. The tail is very short. The anterior maxillary and mandibular\r\nteeth are longer than the posterior teeth. These snakes, most of which are\r\nless than 3 feet in length, inhabit the sandy districts of North Africa,\r\nArabia, and South-Western Asia, extending into Central Asia. One species,\r\n_E. jaculus_, extends into Greece and the Ionian Islands. Like the other\r\nspecies it is an ugly creature, pale grey or yellowish above, with darker\r\npatches and spots. The under parts are whitish. The scales are smooth on\r\nthe front half of the body, becoming keeled further back and on the tail.\r\nTotal length under 2 feet. The pupil is vertical.\r\n\r\nAccording to Zander[187] and Werner[188] this snake lives in sandy\r\nlocalities, digging itself into the sand, or covering the body lightly with\r\nsand and leaving only the eyes and nostrils free. The whole body is very\r\nflabby, and presses itself into any irregularity of the {605}ground over\r\nwhich the snake creeps. Some specimens live on lizards, others prefer mice.\r\nThe prey is caught by the head, and further secured by several turns of the\r\nbody of the captor, whose tail is then turned forwards, round the head of\r\nthe victim, so as to form a kind of knot.\r\n\r\nNot less striking than their agility is their jealousy, which is so strong\r\nthat a snake will occasionally leave the mouse which it has just strangled\r\nin order to seize another snake's mouse. Sometimes several snakes fight for\r\nthe same mouse, coiled together into one inextricable lump so that the\r\nmouse itself is quite invisible. The snakes poke their heads about in\r\nsearch of the hidden prey, and every attempt of one of the snakes to free\r\nitself, causes the others to squeeze it firmer and firmer, thinking\r\napparently that the motion was caused by the lost prey.\r\n\r\nOccasionally one of Werner's captives caught several mice in succession.\r\nWith these it crawled into a corner, dropped the mice, and then proceeded\r\nquietly to swallow one after another. After a fortnight the whole repast\r\nwas digested, and the snake was ready for more.\r\n\r\nFAM. 6. XENOPELTIDAE.–The single species, _Xenopeltis unicolor_, of\r\nSouth-Eastern Asia, including the Malay Islands, has been raised to the\r\ndignity of family-rank on account of the following combination of\r\ncharacters. The prefrontal bones are still in contact with the nasals as in\r\nthe previous families, but the coronoid bones of the mandibles are absent\r\nas in the remaining families. The whole suspensorial apparatus and the\r\nlower jaw itself are peculiar. The dentary bone is movably attached to the\r\nend of the much-elongated articular bone, the movability being enhanced by\r\nthe absence of the coronoid element.[189] The quadrate is short and thick,\r\nand is carried by the short and broad squamosal, which lies flat against\r\nthe skull, resembling in this respect that of some of the Ilysiidae.\r\nBoulenger rightly considers _Xenopeltis_ to be in various ways intermediate\r\nbetween this family, the Boidae and the Colubridae. The head is small and\r\nnot distinct from the neck. The eyes are small and have a vertical pupil.\r\nThe body is cylindrical, covered above with {606}smooth black or brown and\r\nhighly iridescent scales, hence the generic name. The ventral scales are\r\nwhite and transversely enlarged as in the majority of snakes. The tail is\r\nshort, but not stunted, measuring about 4 inches in full-grown specimens of\r\na total length of 3 feet.\r\n\r\nFAM. 7. COLUBRIDAE.–This family comprises those snakes (about nine-tenths\r\nof all recent species) which combine the following\r\ncharacters:–ectopterygoids are present: the squamosals are loosely attached\r\nto the skull, and carry the quadrates, which are not reached by the\r\npterygoids: the prefrontals are not in contact with the nasals: the\r\nmaxillaries are horizontal and form the greater portion of the upper jaws:\r\nthe mandibles lack the coronoid process or element: both jaws are toothed.\r\n\r\nThe best arrangement of this enormous cosmopolitan family with terrestrial,\r\narboreal, and aquatic forms, is that by Boulenger, who, adopting Duméril's\r\nterms, has divided them into three parallel series.\r\n\r\nA. _Aglypha._–All the teeth are solid and not grooved.\r\n\r\nB. _Opisthoglypha._–One or more of the posterior maxillary teeth are\r\ngrooved.\r\n\r\nC. _Proteroglypha._–The anterior maxillary teeth are grooved or\r\n\"perforated.\"\r\n\r\nThe Aglypha are harmless, non-poisonous. Most of the Opisthoglypha are\r\npoisonous, although few of them are dangerously so. The Proteroglypha,\r\nwhich comprise the \"Cobras\" and their allies, are deadly poisonous.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES A. AGLYPHA.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. ACROCHORDINAE.–The postfrontal bones, besides bordering the\r\norbits posteriorly, are extended forwards so as to form the upper border of\r\nthe orbits, separating the latter from the frontals. The few genera and\r\nspecies of this sub-family are mostly aquatic, inhabiting rivers, or\r\nestuaries with brackish water, and they have been known to swim far out\r\ninto the sea. The body is covered with small, frequently granular scales;\r\nin the typically aquatic forms the body is slightly compressed laterally,\r\nand the ventral scales are scarcely larger than the others. Most of these\r\nugly snakes inhabit the rivers of coasts of South-Eastern Asia and\r\nPapuasia; one, _Stoliczkaia_, is found in the Khasia Hills {607}of\r\nNorth-Eastern India; another, _Nothopsis_, lives far from its supposed\r\nallies, on the Isthmus of Darien, Central America.\r\n\r\n_Acrochordus javanicus_ has no ventral shields. The head is flat, covered\r\nwith small granules, with the eyes and nostrils on the upper surface. The\r\ngeneral colour is dull olive-brown, lighter and spotted beneath. The food\r\nconsists of fishes. Total length up to 4 feet.\r\n\r\n_Chersydrus granulatus_ ranges from the coast of Madras to New Guinea. The\r\nbody and tail are compressed, and form a ventral fold, covered with tiny\r\nscales like the rest of the body. General colour grey above, yellow below.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. COLUBRINAE.–The postfrontal bones are restricted to the\r\nposterior border of the orbits. The maxillary and dentary bones carry teeth\r\non their whole length. The scales are usually imbricating. This sub-family\r\ncontains the overwhelming majority of snakes, about 1000 species, all of\r\nthem harmless so far as poison is concerned. None of them reach a great\r\nsize, species of 6 or 7 feet in length being rare, e.g. _Zamenis mucosus_,\r\nbut a few species of the Indian genus _Zaocys_ s. _Coryphodon_ grow to 10\r\nfeet. Most of the Colubrine snakes are oviparous, but some, e.g.\r\n_Coronella_, are viviparous. Some are aquatic, or semi-aquatic, others are\r\nabsolutely arboreal, others again prefer dry, sandy, or rocky localities,\r\naccording to their food. The distribution of the sub-family is\r\ncosmopolitan, finding its natural limits only in the permanently frozen\r\nunder-ground, a condition which makes hibernation impossible. Most of them\r\nlove warmth and like to bask, although many are not fond of the broiling\r\nsun. In the temperate regions they hibernate. As a rule they are\r\nintelligent and some of them become even affectionate.\r\n\r\n_Tropidonotus._–The teeth form closely set series on the whole length of\r\nthe maxillaries, palatines, pterygoids, and the greater portion of the\r\ndentaries. The premaxilla is toothless. The teeth of the maxillaries\r\ngradually increase in length, the posterior teeth being the longest. The\r\npupil is round. There is a pair of internasal shields. The scales covering\r\nthe body have each an apical, sensory pit, are mostly keeled, and are\r\narranged in longitudinal series. The ventral shields are broad; the\r\nsub-caudals form two rows. This genus, with more than seventy species, has\r\na wide range, practically over the whole world with the exception of New\r\nZealand and the southern half of Australia.\r\n\r\n{608}_T. natrix_, the common Grass-Snake, has a divided, or double, anal\r\nshield. The strongly keeled scales of the body form nineteen rows. There\r\nare normally seven upper labials, the third and fourth of which border the\r\neye. The usual colour of the Grass-Snake is olive-grey or brown above, with\r\nblack spots and narrow cross-bands. The labials are white or yellowish,\r\nwith black sutures. The belly is checkered black and white, more or less\r\nsuffused with grey. There are several colour-varieties. The typical or\r\nnorthern form has a white, yellow, or orange collar, bordered behind by a\r\nblack collar; the pale collar is sometimes faint or absent. The second\r\nvariety, rather common in Spain and Portugal, although not the only form in\r\nthe Peninsula, has no collar whatever, and these specimens are sometimes\r\nalmost uniformly grey-green above. The third variety, common in\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe and in Asia Minor, has a well-marked collar and a\r\nyellowish streak along each side of the back. But there are also almost\r\nblack specimens.\r\n\r\nThe usual length of an adult female Grass-Snake is about 3 feet, but very\r\nexceptional cases of more than 6 feet are on record; the males are smaller\r\nand more slenderly built. The range extends over the whole of Middle\r\nEurope, Algeria, West and Central Asia. It does not, however, occur in\r\nIreland or Scotland. Its northern limit is the southern part of Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe Grass-Snake prefers moist, grassy localities, with the neighbourhood of\r\nwater, chiefly on account of the food, which consists entirely of fishes\r\nand Amphibia, notably of frogs; tree-frogs are preferred to anything else;\r\ntoads are occasionally eaten, but mice are never taken.\r\n\r\nThe Grass-Snake can climb trees or rather shrubs and is an accomplished\r\nswimmer, often spending much of its time in water for fishing purposes. The\r\nfish is caught by the belly and then generally swallowed on land. The\r\nGrass-Snakes appear in the spring and disappear in the autumn to hibernate\r\nin the ground. They pair, in England, in the month of May or June, usually\r\non warm and sunny mornings. The eggs are laid from July to the end of\r\nAugust, mostly in rich vegetable soil, in heaps of weeds or in\r\nmanure-heaps. Young snakes lay fewer eggs than old specimens, which\r\nsometimes produce more than three dozen at a time. The eggs are soft,\r\nwhitish yellow, about one inch long, and soon stick together, so that the\r\nwhole clump {609}can be taken up at once. As a rule the new-laid eggs do\r\nnot contain any visible sign of the embryo, but it often happens that the\r\nsnake has to delay oviposition, and then the embryos are more or less\r\nadvanced. This is especially the case with recently caught specimens. The\r\nyoung are hatched in the late summer or in the autumn, and seem to live at\r\nfirst upon soft insects and worms. Curiously enough they are easily drowned\r\nwhen they fall into the water, even in a shallow tank. My tame snakes have\r\noften laid eggs between the stones in the greenhouse; the young throve well\r\nupon unknown food, but most of them met their fate in the water. When they\r\nare a few weeks old they are strong enough to take baby-frogs.\r\n\r\nThe Grass-Snake becomes very tame, learns to distinguish between different\r\npeople, allows itself to be handled without hissing or without voiding the\r\nobnoxiously smelling contents of its cloaca and anal glands, will in time\r\ntake the offered food from the hand, and will even crawl up the arm or\r\nsleeve and coil itself up contentedly. One of the finest specimens, quite\r\ngreen, without a trace of a collar, and with brownish-red eyes, I caught in\r\nthe Guadiana, where it had been fishing in midstream. It swam towards the\r\nbank, dived, and hid itself at the bottom between rocks. This snake, a\r\nfemale, became very tame. It never hibernated, shed its skin regularly\r\nevery few months, and grew within nine years from 35 inches to 42 inches in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe Grass-Snake is perfectly harmless: although hissing, and striking out\r\nfuriously with its head, it never bites, not even when it is severely\r\nhandled. Its only defence consists of the awful contents of the cloaca and\r\nthe anal glands, the secretion of which smells of concentrated essence of\r\ngarlic mixed with other indescribable odours. The wildest specimens I have\r\never met with inhabited a swamp with a little stream to the north of Oporto\r\nclose to the coast. To my utter surprise some of them actually made for me,\r\nswimming along rapidly with the head erect, about 6 inches above the water,\r\nand darting forwards with widely opened jaws, but they did not bite. These\r\nand other kinds of allied snakes require to drink much and often.\r\nOccasionally they drink milk when this is offered them, but that they suck\r\nthe udders of cows or the breasts of women is an idle fable.\r\n\r\n{610}_T. viperinus._–The scales are strongly keeled and form twenty-one to\r\ntwenty-three longitudinal rows. The third and fourth labials border the\r\neye. The anal shield is divided. The eyes and nostrils are directed upwards\r\ninstead of sidewards, in adaptation to the essentially aquatic habits of\r\nthis species, which lives upon fishes and Amphibia. The general colour is\r\ngrey to reddish brown, with a black zigzag band along the back and a\r\nlateral series of black, yellow-eyed spots. The belly is yellow or red,\r\ncheckered with black.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.–_Tropidonotus sirtalis._ × ½.]\r\n\r\nThe Viperine Snake bears a general resemblance to the common viper. It\r\ninhabits France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and Morocco. Very large\r\nspecimens attain a length of nearly 3 feet, but the ordinary size of adults\r\nis 2 feet. This snake spends most of its time in the water, but it is often\r\nfound on land, basking on the top of a low wall or on a low shrub. It is\r\nexceedingly common in Spain and Portugal, where it inhabits almost every\r\nditch, any standing water or slow river. In the Alemtejo, when during the\r\nrainless and hot summer the small {611}rivers have nearly dried up, these\r\nsnakes collect in great quantities in the remaining stagnant and muddy\r\npools, and as the stock of suitable fish gets exhausted, are often reduced\r\nto a deplorably emaciated condition. By the month of August they have\r\nbecome so thoroughly aquatic that they cannot be kept alive in dry\r\nsurroundings for twenty-four hours. Those which I collected generally died,\r\napparently from some kind of cutaneous suffocation, during the night\r\nfollowing their capture. Taken under other conditions they are very easily\r\nkept and tamed.\r\n\r\nI once caught a Viperine Snake in a ditch whilst it was swallowing an eel\r\nof nearly its own length. Both were separated, and then put into a small\r\nbag together with other creatures, and no more attention was paid to them\r\nfor several hours. When I opened the bag again, the snake, undisturbed by\r\nmy incessant walking about, was again busily engaged in trying to get\r\noutside that same eel!\r\n\r\n_T. sirtalis_ (Fig. 160) is one of the almost endless varieties of what is\r\nnow known by the name _T. ordinatus_, of North and Central America.\r\n\r\n_T. tesselatus_ is closely allied to _T. viperinus_, which it represents in\r\nSouth Germany, Italy, South-Eastern Europe, and Asia; but the scales form\r\nonly nineteen rows, and the fourth, or fourth and fifth labials, border the\r\neye. The usual colour is olive-grey with dark little spots, and with a dark\r\nchevron-shaped band behind the occiput. The lower parts are yellow or red\r\ncheckered with black, hence the specific name.\r\n\r\n_Zamenis._–The maxillary teeth are not closely packed; they increase\r\nslightly in size backwards, and the last two are often a little larger and\r\nseparated from the rest by a diastema. The mandibular teeth rather decrease\r\nin size from before backwards, inversely with the upper teeth. The scales\r\nare smooth with apical pits; the sub-caudals form two rows. The eye is\r\nlarge, and has a round pupil. The range of this genus, with about thirty\r\nspecies, extends over the whole of the Periarctic region.\r\n\r\n_Z._ (_Ptyas_) _mucosus_ (Fig. 161), the Rat Snake of India, extending from\r\nTranscaspia to Java, is a very common species, often seen in menageries.\r\nIts general colour is brown above, often with black cross-bands on the\r\nhinder part of the body and tail. The under parts are yellowish. The fourth\r\nand fifth labials border the eye. {612}The scales on the body form only\r\nseventeen rows. Another feature of this species is the prominent ridge of\r\nthe back-bone, not only in half-starved but in well-conditioned specimens.\r\nThe Rat Snake grows to a length of more than 7 feet, and is as ill-tempered\r\nas most species of this genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.–_Zamenis mucosus_ (Rat Snake). × ⅕.]\r\n\r\n_Z. gemonensis_ s. _viridiflavus_ inhabits France, Italy, the Balkan\r\nPeninsula, and Asia Minor. Its coloration is very variable. In general it\r\nis either green above and yellow below, hence the appropriate name\r\n_viridiflavus_, or the ground-colour of the back is greyish or olive-yellow\r\nwith brownish spots, which form more or less longitudinal rows on the\r\ntrunk, but gradually pass into blackish continuous lines on the tail; the\r\nunder parts are yellow or greenish white, often with many very small, dark\r\nspecks. The scales form seventeen or nineteen rows; the anal shield is\r\ndivided. There are two small postocular scales and one subocular; of the\r\neight labials, the fourth and fifth border the eye. This species is very\r\nlively, attacks {613}and bites furiously, climbs well, and when suspended\r\nfrom branches can protrude half of its length in a horizontal direction. It\r\neats any kind of Reptile, Bird, or Mammal it can master; small animals are\r\nswallowed directly, rats and moles are first killed by constrictions. Large\r\nspecimens reach perhaps 6 feet in length.\r\n\r\n_Z. hippocrepis_ is the representative species in the Iberian Peninsula and\r\nin North-Western Africa. It is rarely more than 4 feet long, and is very\r\npretty, the ground-colour being reddish or olive-yellow with a row of\r\nlarge, dark brown, yellow-edged spots along the back. Two rows of smaller\r\nspots adorn the sides; where the dark spots are large, the pale\r\nground-colour is restricted to forming rings around the spots, producing a\r\npretty appearance. The under parts are yellow or orange, with black spots.\r\nOn the head is a dark, pale-edged patch in the shape of a horse-shoe, a\r\nfeature alluded to by the specific name. Structural characters are the\r\npossession of a row of little subocular scales, which completely separate\r\nthe eye from the labials, the double anal shield, and the small and smooth\r\nscales on the body, which form generally as many as twenty-seven rows.\r\n\r\n_Z. constrictor._–The American Black Snake. The scales are smooth, and\r\narranged in seventeen rows; the anal shield is divided. The general colour\r\nabove is uniform bluish-black; below slaty, tinged with blue; the chin and\r\nthroat are silvery white, sometimes with a black spot. Large specimens\r\nattain a total length of 6 feet.\r\n\r\nHolbrook gives the following exhaustive account of this species, about\r\nwhich many sensational stories are current even in would-be scientific\r\nperiodicals:–\r\n\r\nThe \"Black Snake\" is one of the commonest of North American species. It is\r\nextremely active, climbing with facility, and running with great rapidity,\r\nwhence it is not uncommonly called the \"Racer.\" It frequents shady places,\r\ncovered with thick shrubs, on the margins of water. It feeds on mice,\r\ntoads, or small birds; and, as it is an excellent climber, is frequently\r\nseen on trees in search of birds' nests. It is a bold and daring serpent,\r\nenters barns and out-houses without fear, and has been known to destroy\r\nyoung chickens. Its specific name _constrictor_ would imply that it\r\nsuffocates or crushes its prey, but this according to Holbrook is at least\r\ndoubtful. In the {614}breeding season it is extremely irascible, and will\r\nfrequently attack persons passing at a distance of several steps; the tail\r\nthen quivers with rage, making a quick vibrating motion, which in forests\r\nand among dead leaves sounds not unlike the Rattle-Snake; it now elevates\r\nthe head one or two feet from the ground, and darts upon its adversary;\r\nluckily its bite is harmless, and not more painful than the scratch of a\r\npin.\r\n\r\n\"It will even descend from trees to attack its enemy if teazed, yet it does\r\nnot twine itself around the legs, as is commonly supposed.\r\n\r\n\"The same power of charming its prey has been attributed to the Black as to\r\nthe Rattle-Snake, and with still less appearance of reason; for this is a\r\nnimble animal, and can pursue its prey, while the Rattle-Snake must lie in\r\nwait for his. It is remarkable that the birds most commonly found 'charmed'\r\nare the Cat-bird (_Turdus carolinensis_) or red-winged Black-bird (_Icterus\r\nphoeniceus_). These birds choose thick and shady places on the margins of\r\nstreams for their residence, and generally build their nests on such shrubs\r\nas the alder; the latter bird not unfrequently takes the precaution to\r\nselect such bushes as are on small islands, or such as have their roots\r\nsurrounded by water, and thus their home is more secure. Now the Black\r\nSnake chooses precisely the same localities, knowing probably the haunts of\r\nits prey. The serpent begins the war by besieging the nest; the old bird,\r\naware of its intention, attacks it with fluttering and uncertain motions,\r\naccompanied by a plaintive cry of distress, and is then said to be\r\n'charmed.' The snake is at last either driven off, or it captures the young\r\nand not unfrequently the old bird too.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes the old bird, by her cries, calls in the assistance of her\r\nneighbours to drive away the aggressor. I have seen more than a dozen birds\r\nthus engaged with a large Black Snake that had probably just committed some\r\ndepredation, but was now quietly stretched on a rock, basking in the sun;\r\nand it was not a little singular that birds of very different genera, and\r\nthose seldom seen together, all united in this warfare against a common\r\nenemy, and finally compelled him to seek shelter among some low, thick\r\nshrubs, by the violence of their assault.\"\r\n\r\n_Zaocys_, with about half-a-dozen species in South-Eastern Asia, is closely\r\nallied to _Zamenis_. _Z. carinatus_, of the Malay {615}Islands, grows to 10\r\nfeet in length; it is consequently one of the largest harmless Colubrine\r\nsnakes. The scales form only sixteen to eighteen rows. The sub-caudals are\r\ndouble. The general colour above is dark olive, passing into greenish brown\r\nfarther back. The under parts are yellowish; black and yellow posteriorly.\r\nThe fifth and sixth labials border the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.–_Zaocys carinatus._ × ¼.]\r\n\r\n_Coluber._–The maxillary teeth are of equal size, but the anterior\r\nmandibular teeth are the longest. The head is distinct from the neck. The\r\nnasals are distinct; not fused with the loreals. The eye is rather large,\r\nwith a round pupil. The scales, smooth or keeled, have apical pits; the\r\nventrals are rounded or angulate laterally; the sub-caudals are double.\r\nThey all lay eggs and constrict their food. Nearly fifty species in the\r\nPeriarctic region.\r\n\r\n_C._ (_Elaphis_) _quatuorlineatus_ s. _quaterradiatus_ inhabits Italy and\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe. It occurs also in the Southern Tyrol. The scales of\r\nthis large snake, which grows to nearly 6 feet in length, are arranged in\r\ntwenty-five rows, and are feebly {616}keeled. The anal is divided. Adult\r\nspecimens have a yellowish-brown ground-colour with a pair of black streaks\r\non each side of the back. A black line extends from the eye to the angle of\r\nthe mouth; the under parts are yellow, mostly closely spotted with brown.\r\nThis snake is good-tempered, and keeps well in captivity. They live on\r\nsparrows, mice, lizards, etc., and are very fond of eggs. Large specimens\r\ncan swallow several fowls' eggs in succession; the crushed remains of the\r\nshells are later disgorged. This handsome snake climbs extremely well in\r\nsearch of birds and their eggs, and it is not afraid of the water. The prey\r\nis caught either with the teeth or by a rapid twist of the tail; in any\r\ncase, the prey is always strangulated by the constriction of coils thrown\r\nround it. A sparrow thus secured is literally passed through the moving\r\ncoils along the snake's body into a position convenient for swallowing.\r\nHungry snakes catch and secure several birds or mice before eating them. My\r\nown specimens became almost affectionately tame, never attempted to bite,\r\nand took food from the hand.\r\n\r\n_C. leopardinus_ is smaller, but is one of the handsomest snakes of\r\nSouthern Italy, South-Eastern Europe, and Asia Minor. It is closely allied\r\nto the previously described species. The ground-colour is pale brown with a\r\ndorsal series of dark brown or reddish, black-edged, transverse spots, and\r\na lateral alternating series of smaller black spots, or with two dark\r\nbrown, black-edged stripes bordering a yellowish vertebral stripe; usually\r\nwith a forked black mark on the occiput and nape. The under parts are\r\nwhite, checkered with black, sometimes with the latter colour prevailing.\r\n\r\n_C. flavescens_ s. _aesculapii_ is the Aesculap-Snake, for which the almost\r\nunknown name of _longissimus_ has now been unearthed in deference to the\r\nfetish of priority. This snake is of an extremely graceful and slender\r\nbuild, with a very long tail. Its home is the South of France, Italy, and\r\nSouth-Eastern Europe. It occurs sporadically in the Tyrol, for instance\r\nnear Bozen, in Austria, at Baden near Vienna, in Germany only in the\r\nTaunus, especially at Schlangenbad, which has received its name from the\r\nfrequent occurrence of this snake. This sporadic distribution favours the\r\nidea that these snakes were introduced by the Romans as inmates of the\r\ntemples erected to Aesculapius at such watering-places. Specific characters\r\nare the smooth and shiny scales, {617}which are arranged in twenty-one to\r\ntwenty-three rows, the distinctly angulate ventrals and the double anal and\r\nsub-caudals; the fourth and fifth of the upper labials border the eye,\r\nwhich has a round pupil. The coloration is very variable, as a rule\r\nolive-brown above with a dark streak behind the eye; the upper lips and a\r\ntriangular patch on the temples are yellow; the under parts are uniform\r\npale yellow. Some specimens are pale golden brown; others are very dark,\r\nalmost black; while some have four darker stripes along the body, and\r\nlastly whitish specks occur on the upper surface. Large Aesculap snakes\r\ngrow to a length of 5 feet. Their food consists chiefly of mice. They\r\nbecome very tame, although many of them at first bite furiously. Their\r\nclimbing capacities are astonishing, the snakes being able to scale high\r\nand vertical walls provided there is the slightest \"foothold.\" Some of my\r\nspecimens escaped in the room and were at last found near the ceiling,\r\nresting on the rods of the curtains, up the folds of which they had managed\r\nto wriggle. Boulenger kept one for many years in a glass cage, where the\r\nsnake entwined himself round the branches of a stick and allowed us to take\r\nhim with the stick out of its socket and to inspect him. Being kept in an\r\ninhabited room, the snake did not exactly hibernate, creeping into the moss\r\nat the bottom of the cage; but it refused to feed, and remained in a rather\r\ndrowsy condition coiled up on its favourite stand. During the pairing\r\nseason they frequently resort to the water, at Schlangenbad at least; the\r\nfew eggs are deposited under dry moss or in dry, decayed wood, and are\r\nhatched in about six weeks.\r\n\r\n_C._ (_Rhinechis_) _scalaris_ has the smooth scales disposed in\r\ntwenty-seven rows. The snout is strongly projecting, and has a V-shaped\r\ndark mark on the top; a black streak runs through the eye, and another\r\nblack spot lies below the eye. Young specimens are pale brown with a series\r\nof dark H-shaped marks on the back, suggesting a ladder, hence the specific\r\nname. In the adult these marks are replaced by a pair of brown stripes\r\nrunning along the back; the under parts are always uniform yellow. Total\r\nlength about 3 feet. This snake is restricted to the Iberian Peninsula and\r\nto the South of France. Most specimens are very ill-tempered. The young\r\nlive upon locusts and small lizards, the old eat mice and small birds. In\r\ncaptivity they also take dead animals–a rare habit with snakes.\r\n\r\n{618}_Dendrophis_ with about ten species inhabits South-Eastern Asia and\r\nAustralia. They are typical Tree-Snakes. The scales are keeled, and form\r\nonly thirteen or fifteen rows; those of the vertebral row are enlarged; the\r\nventrals have a pair of suture-like lateral keels and a notch on each side,\r\narrangements which are of great assistance in climbing, these snakes being\r\nable to slide up the branches of trees in almost straight lines instead of\r\nhaving to twist and undulate their way up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.–_Dendrophis punctulatus._ × ½.]\r\n\r\n_D. punctulatus_, of Northern and Eastern Australia, is olive-brown above,\r\nuniform or with black edges and yellow outer borders to the scales. The\r\nupper lips, the throat and anterior ventrals, are yellowish. Total length\r\nup to 6 feet.\r\n\r\n_Leptophis_ is a Neotropical genus of Tree-Snakes. The body and the\r\nextremely long, whip-like tail are very slender. The head is very distinct\r\nfrom the neck; the eye is large, with a round pupil. The scales form\r\nthirteen or fifteen rows; the ventrals are sometimes angulate laterally;\r\nthe sub-caudals are double. _L._ (_Ahaetulla_) _liocerus_ is a beautiful\r\nsnake, green above {619}with a golden lustre, while the under parts are\r\nyellow or white. The total length of this species amounts to 6 feet, the\r\ntail then being nearly 2 feet long. These graceful Tree-Snakes live upon\r\nsmall reptiles and birds and their eggs. When shaken out of a tree or\r\nfrightened off they let themselves fall down from considerable heights,\r\ncoiling body and tail like a watch-spring, and alighting on the ground upon\r\nthe spiral, which breaks the fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.–_Leptophis liocerus._ × ½.]\r\n\r\n_Coronella._–The teeth are nearly all of equal size and form continuous\r\nseries. The scales are smooth and have apical pits; the sub-caudals are\r\ndouble. The head is scarcely distinct from the neck. The pupil is round.\r\nThis genus, with nearly twenty species, is widely distributed except in the\r\nAustralian region, the northern half of Asia, and South America. We can\r\nmention only the two European species, one of which occurs in England.\r\n\r\n{620}[Illustration: FIG. 165.–_Coronella laevis_, Smooth Snake (left), and\r\ntwo _Vipera berus_, Common Viper (right). × ½.]\r\n\r\n{621}_C. austriaca_ s. _laevis_, the Smooth Snake. The scales are arranged\r\nin nineteen rows. Mostly the third and fourth labials border the eye. The\r\nanal shield is divided. The general colour is brown or reddish above, often\r\nwith one or two lighter stripes, with small dark brown or red spots; two\r\ndark brown or red stripes on the nape, usually confluent with a large dark\r\npatch on the occiput; a dark streak extends from the nostril through the\r\neye to the angle of the mouth. The under parts are red, orange, brown, grey\r\nor blackish, either uniform or speckled with black and white. The\r\ncoloration is, however, subject to much variation, and some specimens\r\nstrikingly resemble some of the Common Viper, which is also very variable\r\nin its coloration. The resemblance is enhanced when the Smooth Snake\r\nbroadens its head by widening the jaws, as it is in the habit of doing. Two\r\nsuch similarly coloured specimens are represented in Fig. 165. On closer\r\ninspection the differences are great enough, the harmless snake having\r\nsmooth scales, and the top of the head being covered with large shields;\r\nwhile the Viper has keeled scales, the top of the head being covered mostly\r\nwith scales, a vertical (not round) pupil, and, moreover, when attacked,\r\nusually coils itself into a spiral disc with the head standing out in the\r\nmiddle, ready to strike. However, these two species are sometimes mistaken\r\nfor each other.–The Smooth Snake prefers lizards as food to anything else,\r\nbut it also takes mice. The prey is hunted chiefly in the late afternoon\r\nand in the evening, and is constricted by the coils of the snake. When\r\ncaught or even when handled after months of captivity, the Smooth Snake\r\nbites deliberately and firmly, selecting a suitable spot, for instance a\r\nfinger, opens the mouth widely and almost chews the spot. The bite is of\r\ncourse quite harmless, and scarcely draws blood, few of these snakes\r\nattaining a length of more than 2 feet. They are viviparous, bringing forth\r\nabout half-a-dozen young at a time. The range of the Smooth Snake extends\r\nover the greater part of temperate Europe, from England and the Iberian\r\nPeninsula to Berlin, and south-eastwards to Asia Minor. In England it\r\noccurs in a few counties only, for instance in Hampshire and in\r\nDorsetshire.\r\n\r\n_C. girondica_, of the South of France, Italy, the Iberian Peninsula and\r\nNorth-Western Africa, much resembles the English Smooth Snake, from which\r\nit differs in a few points only. The scales are arranged in twenty-one,\r\nrarely in nineteen, rows; usually the fourth and fifth labials border the\r\neye; and the rostral {622}shield, covering the end of the snout, is much\r\nbroader than high. The coloration is variable, but there is always a pair\r\nof elongated blackish spots or a U-shaped mark on the nape.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 3. RHACHIODONTINAE.–With only a few teeth on the posterior part of\r\nthe maxillaries, on the palatines and dentaries. Some of the vertebrae in\r\nthe region of the lower neck have strongly developed hypapophyses, which\r\nare directed forwards and pierce the oesophagus. They are used for filing\r\nthrough or breaking the birds' eggs which seem to be the chief food of\r\nthese snakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.–_Dasypeltis scabra._ × ½.]\r\n\r\n_Dasypeltis scabra_, the only species, inhabits Tropical and South Africa;\r\nalthough it reaches scarcely more than two feet and a half in length, such\r\na specimen is able to swallow an ordinary fowl's egg. Pigeons' eggs are\r\nswallowed by snakes little more than one foot in length, which seems at\r\nfirst sight quite impossible. The swallowed egg distends the skin to its\r\nutmost capacity; it then slides down further, the snake makes some slight\r\ncontortions and the swelling collapses; after a while the broken and\r\nsucked-out shell is vomited out as a crumpled up {623}mass. Miss Durham has\r\nillustrated this curious process in a series of drawings.[190]\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES B. OPISTHOGLYPHA.\r\n\r\nOne, or a few, of the posterior maxillary teeth have a groove or furrow in\r\nfront, which conducts the secretion of the enlarged upper labial glands.\r\nApparently all these snakes are more or less poisonous, paralysing their\r\nprey before or during the act of deglutition. So far as man is concerned\r\nthey are rather harmless, since the poison is not very strong, not\r\navailable in large quantities, and above all because the small poison-teeth\r\nstand so far back that the snakes cannot easily inflict wounds with them.\r\n\r\nThe Opisthoglypha are of considerable morphological interest, since they\r\nconnect the Colubridae with the Viperidae, the characteristic poisonous\r\napparatus of which seems to have been derived from that of the\r\nOpisthoglypha by the reduction or shortening of the anterior portion of the\r\nmaxillaries and the harmless teeth, so that the posterior or poison-fangs\r\ncome to the front.\r\n\r\nThe Opisthoglypha comprise about three hundred species and are\r\ncosmopolitan, including Madagascar but excepting New Zealand. They contain\r\ntruly terrestrial, arboreal, and thoroughly aquatic forms.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. DIPSADOMORPHINAE.–The nostrils are lateral and the dentition is\r\nwell developed. Long-tailed, terrestrial, and arboreal forms. Most of the\r\narboreal species are green above, often with white or yellow longitudinal\r\nbands, while the under parts are white or yellow. They feed chiefly upon\r\nlizards, birds and their eggs.\r\n\r\n_Dipsadomorphus_ s. _Dipsas_ (part).–Typical, very long-bodied and\r\nlong-tailed Tree-Snakes, with a vertical pupil. The median or vertebral row\r\nof smooth scales is enlarged; the broad ventral scales are bent at an\r\nobtuse angle on the sides, the resulting ridge assisting in climbing. The\r\nsub-caudals are arranged in two rows. Ten to fourteen maxillary teeth are\r\nfollowed by two or three enlarged, grooved fangs.\r\n\r\n_D. trigonatus_, of India, grows to one yard in length. Yellowish olive or\r\npale grey above, with a white, black-edged {624}zigzag band along the back,\r\nor with a series of white, black-edged spots.\r\n\r\n_D. cyaneus_, of Northern India, Assam, etc., is a beautiful Tree-Snake,\r\ngreen above, with the skin between the scales black, uniform greenish\r\nyellow below. Total length up to 4 or 5 feet.\r\n\r\n_Dipsas_ e.g. _D. bucephala_.–Maxillaries with eleven or more teeth.\r\nPterygoids toothless. Body strongly compressed, with thirteen rows of\r\nsmooth scales; the vertebral row enlarged; sub-caudals double; tail very\r\nlong. Tropical South America.\r\n\r\n_Leptognathus_ with many species in Central and South America, like\r\n_Dipsas_, but with teeth on the pterygoids.\r\n\r\n_Coelopeltis._–Terrestrial and diurnal, with a round pupil. The row of\r\nsmall maxillary teeth is followed by one or two much larger, grooved fangs\r\nsituated at a level below the posterior border of the eye. The first\r\nhalf-a-dozen mandibular teeth are much larger than the rest. The scales of\r\nthe adult are more or less distinctly grooved longitudinally, hence the\r\ngeneric name, and are arranged in seventeen or nineteen rows. The\r\nsub-caudals form two rows; the ventrals are rounded off laterally. Two\r\nspecies in the Mediterranean countries and in South-Western Asia.\r\n\r\n_C. monspessulana_ s. _lacertina_ is one of the largest snakes in Europe,\r\nreaching a length of 6 feet, of which the tail takes up 18 inches.\r\nOlive-brown or yellowish or reddish above, frequently with small, dark,\r\nlight-edged spots. The sides are often blackish, with whitish specks. The\r\nunder parts are yellowish white, with or without brownish markings. Some\r\nspecimens are very green, with a dull blackish neck. One of the specific\r\nnames of this terrestrial snake is the latinised form of Montpellier; the\r\nother refers to the shape of the head, which is not unlike that of a\r\nlizard, partly owing to the concave forehead. This species inhabits rather\r\ndry localities studded with shrubs, where it hunts for lizards, birds, and\r\nmice. It is sure to attract notice by its loud hissing when it is\r\ndisturbed. When driven into a corner it strikes out furiously, but does\r\nnot, as a rule, bite. I have caught some which after a few days became\r\nquite gentle. Small animals become torpid a few minutes after they have\r\nbeen bitten.\r\n\r\n_Macroprotodon cucullatus_ occurs in Andalucia, the Balearic Islands, and\r\nin North Africa. The dentition is peculiar. The {625}fourth and fifth\r\nmaxillary teeth are enlarged, followed by an interspace, then follow\r\nseveral small teeth, and lastly the two enlarged, grooved teeth. The sixth\r\nmandibular tooth is very long, separated by a space from the much smaller\r\nposterior teeth. The general colour of this sand-loving snake is pale brown\r\nor grey above with small spots or streaks on the trunk, and with a large\r\nblack patch behind the head extending over the sides of the neck, hence the\r\nspecific name. The under parts are bright red or yellowish, sometimes\r\nspotted with black. Total length under 2 feet.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. ELACHISTODONTINAE.–With only a few teeth on the posterior part\r\nof the maxillary and dentary bones, and on the palatines and pterygoids.\r\nSome of the vertebrae in the thoracic region have much-developed unpaired\r\nhypapophyses, which are directed forwards and pierce the dorsal wall of the\r\ngullet. In this respect _Elachistodon westermanni_, of Bengal, the only\r\nspecies, bears a striking resemblance to the South African Aglyphodont\r\n_Dasypeltis_ (see p. 622), and it is probable that this apparently very\r\nrare Indian snake also swallows eggs. It is brown above, with a yellowish\r\nvertebral stripe; yellowish below.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 3. HOMALOPSINAE.–The nostrils of these absolutely aquatic and\r\nviviparous snakes are valvular, and are situated on the upper surface of\r\nthe snout. The eyes are small with vertical pupils. The two dozen species,\r\nmostly very ugly, inhabit the rivers and estuaries of the East Indies from\r\nBengal to North Australia. Some species have very small and narrow ventral\r\nscales, recalling the Hydrophinae, or the burrowing snakes, none of which\r\nuse their ventral scales for locomotory purposes.\r\n\r\n_Homalopsis buccata_, _Cerberus rhynchops_ and _Hypsirhina_, e.g. _H.\r\nplumbea_, have well-developed ventral scales; the other scales of the first\r\ntwo genera are keeled, those of the third are smooth. In _Hipistes_ the\r\nwhole head is covered with very small scales; all the scales of the body\r\nare smooth except the very narrow ventrals, which have double keels. _H.\r\nhydrinus_, of Siam and the Malay Peninsula, has a compressed body, and in\r\nits general appearance much resembles the Hydrophinae. It lives, like its\r\nallies, upon fishes, and it swims far out into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES C. PROTEROGLYPHA.\r\n\r\nThe anterior maxillary teeth are deeply grooved, or so folded {626}as to\r\nappear hollow or perforated. Behind these enlarged poison-fangs the maxilla\r\ncarries a series of smaller, solid teeth; hence the term \"proteroglyphous,\"\r\nwhich means that the anterior teeth are grooved, in opposition to\r\n\"opisthoglyphous.\" Both series have been developed independently.\r\n\r\nThe Proteroglypha are all extremely poisonous, mostly viviparous, and\r\nwidely distributed over the whole of the Australian, Palaeotropical and\r\nNeotropical regions, with the exception of Madagascar and New Zealand; they\r\nextend northwards into the warmer parts of North America, and they also\r\nrange over a great portion of the Palaearctic sub-region, being found in\r\nNorth Africa and South-Western Asia. They form two natural sub-families:\r\nElapinae, with cylindrical tails, and Hydrophinae or Sea-Snakes, with\r\nlaterally compressed tails.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. ELAPINAE.–The tail is cylindrical. The Elapinae comprise nearly\r\n150 species, which have been grouped into a great number of, mostly\r\nsomewhat imaginary, genera. In Australia they constitute the great majority\r\nof Snakes, there being besides the deadly Elapinae only a few Pythons and\r\nTyphlopidae, and very few Colubrinae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.–Map showing the distribution of the Elapine\r\nSnakes.]\r\n\r\n_Naja._–The pair of large and grooved poison-fangs are separated by an\r\ninterspace from one to three small, faintly grooved teeth near the\r\nposterior end of the maxillaries. The scales are smooth and without pits,\r\nand are arranged in fifteen to twenty-five oblique rows on the trunk,\r\nalthough more occur in the region of the neck; the vertebral row is not\r\nenlarged. The head is but slightly distinct from the neck. Each nostril\r\nlies between two nasals and the internasal. The sub-caudals form two rows.\r\nThe pupil is round. The neck-region can be expanded {627}into a hood by the\r\nspreading and moving headwards of the ribs. Several species in Southern\r\nAsia and in Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.–_Naja tripudians_ (the Cobra). × ⅕.]\r\n\r\n_N. tripudians_ (the \"Cobra\").–The coloration varies much. The typical form\r\nis yellowish to dark brown with a black and white spectacle-mark on the\r\ndorsal side of the hood, and with a large black and white spot on each side\r\nof the corresponding under surface. Other specimens are uniform pale brown\r\nto blackish grey, without any markings on the hood. The Cobra is widely\r\ndistributed, from Transcaspia to China and to the Malay Islands; in the\r\nHimalayas it ascends to about 8000 feet above the level of the sea. Very\r\nlarge specimens are said to attain more than 6 feet in length, but a cobra\r\nof 5 feet, inclusive of the tail of 9 inches, is considered large. The\r\nCobra prefers places which afford it a convenient hole to retire into; for\r\ninstance, deserted hills of termites, ruins, heaps of stones and stacks of\r\nwood, and it has the disagreeable habit, like the harmless Rat-snake,\r\n_Zamenis mucosus_, of making itself at home in inhabited houses, probably\r\nattracted by the rats. Its chief food consists of small Vertebrates;–frogs,\r\nlizards, rats, occasionally fishes and {628}small birds. It drinks much,\r\nand hunts chiefly in the late afternoon and in the evening, although it\r\npossesses a round pupil. It avoids hot sunshine. Many observations show\r\nthat the cobras live in pairs, otherwise they do not take much notice of\r\neach other or of other kinds of snakes. The female lays about a dozen\r\nsoft-shelled eggs as large as those of pigeons.\r\n\r\nThis cobra is used by Indian conjurers. The \"dance\" is the habit of these\r\nsnakes of erecting themselves, when agitated, upon the hinder third or\r\nquarter of their length, whilst they spread out the hood and sway the head\r\nand neck to the right and left, always in an attitude ready for striking.\r\nThey are docile and by nature not vicious. Most of the performing cobras\r\nhave their teeth drawn, and they then know well that they cannot bite. They\r\nonly strike at the hand, just as uninjured specimens soon avoid biting into\r\nthe iron rod with which they are lifted up in menageries. The drawing of\r\nthe teeth is an operation which has to be repeated, since reserve-teeth\r\nsoon take the place of the lost pair.\r\n\r\nI cannot refrain from relating an abstract of a ridiculous episode which\r\nhappened in the Munich Aquarium in the year 1882. One of six specimens of\r\nthe African species _Naja haje_ was missing. The police closed the\r\nestablishment, which during the following eight days was turned inside out\r\nwithout any other effect than that two other, harmless, snakes were\r\ndiscovered. Twice the building was fumigated with sulphur, until the Cobra\r\nwas at last found suffocated, fifteen days after the beginning of the\r\nsearch. This snake caused the owner of the Aquarium a loss of nearly £1500.\r\nBut the cruel joke was, that during the commotion the man who had collected\r\nand sold the six snakes declared upon oath that their teeth had been so\r\nwell drawn and the germs of possible reserve-teeth had been so thoroughly\r\ndestroyed that the snakes were rendered absolutely harmless. But he was not\r\nbelieved, in spite of a commission of professors and doctors appointed, who\r\nexperimented upon the remaining five Cobras with sulphur and did not find\r\nany poison-fangs, \"although the mouth was probed and poked into as far down\r\nas the larynx.\"\r\n\r\nCobras have quite a number of enemies. Peafowl and Jungle-cocks are said to\r\nbe partial to young snakes; pigs eat them greedily, and are to a certain\r\nextent immune against {629}their bite. The same applies, according to the\r\nmost recent observations, to the famous Mongoos. Sir E. Tennent, in his\r\n_Natural History of Ceylon_, quoted several times in the present book,\r\nmakes the following remarks about the immunity of this little creature:–\r\n\r\n\"I have found universally that the natives of Ceylon attach no credit to\r\nthe European story of the Mongoos (_Herpestes griseus_) resorting to some\r\nplant, which no one has yet succeeded in identifying, as an antidote\r\nagainst the bite of the venomous serpents on which it preys. There is no\r\ndoubt that, in its conflicts with the cobra and other poisonous snakes,\r\nwhich it attacks with as little hesitation as the harmless ones, it may be\r\nseen occasionally to retreat, and even to retire into the jungle, and, it\r\nis added, to eat some vegetable.... A number of plants, such as the\r\n_Ophioxylon serpentinum_ and _Ophiorhiza mungos_, the _Aristolochia\r\nindica_, the _Mimosa octandria_, and others, have each been asserted to be\r\nthe Ichneumon's specific.... If the Ichneumon were inspired by that courage\r\nwhich would result from the consciousness of security, it would be so\r\nindifferent to the bite of the serpent, that we might conclude that, both\r\nin its approaches and its assault, it would be utterly careless as to the\r\nprecise mode of attack. Such, however, is far from being the case; and next\r\nto its audacity, nothing can be more surprising than the adroitness with\r\nwhich it escapes the spring of the snake under a due sense of danger, and\r\nthe cunning with which it makes its arrangements to leap upon the back and\r\nfasten its teeth in the head of the cobra. It is this display of\r\ninstinctive ingenuity that Lucan celebrates where he paints the Ichneumon\r\ndiverting the attention of the Asp by the motion of his bushy tail, and\r\nthen seizing it in the midst of its confusion. See _Pharsalia_, lib. iv.\r\nverses 729-734.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread belief in the efficacy of \"Snake-stones,\" which are\r\ngenerally pieces of charred bone, well polished, occasionally pieces of\r\nchalk or some similar porous substance, which, if pressed upon the bleeding\r\nwound, are supposed to absorb the poison. Snake-charmers profess to prepare\r\nsuch \"stones,\" and to preserve the composition as a secret. The manufacture\r\nis a lucrative trade. The Boers bought them, imported from India, at high\r\nprices. Mr. Selous saw one, or heard of one, that was kept as an heirloom.\r\nSnake-stones are {630}also made, and used, in Mexico, of charred hartshorn;\r\nthey are called \"piedras ponsonas.\"\r\n\r\nThe use of the Snake-stone, called \"Pamboo-Kaloo,\" has probably been\r\ncommunicated to the Singhalese by the itinerant snake-charmers who resort\r\nto the island from the coast of Coromandel.\r\n\r\nAlthough Sir E. Tennent describes several instances of the successful\r\napplication of snake-stones as well authenticated, he has never himself\r\nbeen an eye-witness. Although two cases have been fully described, they do\r\nnot at all exclude the possibility, nay the probability, that the Tamils\r\nimposed upon the Europeans in order to sell the snake-stones.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt the snake-stones, owing to their porous nature, adhered to the\r\nbleeding wound, became saturated with blood, and then fell off. Very\r\nlikely, in case of a poisonous bite, some of the venom would be sucked up\r\ntoo, but we do not know if those snakes were still in the possession of\r\ntheir poison-fangs. Properly conducted experiments with snake-stones have\r\nproved as little efficacious as the application of dry cup.\r\n\r\n\"Theoretically snake-stones as quick absorbent agents of the blood with the\r\npoison are good; they will certainly prevent some of the poison from\r\nentering the system, but that would, at best, be a partial cure only.\r\n\r\n\"In March 1854 a friend of mine was riding, with some other civil officers\r\nof the Government, along a jungle path in the vicinity of Bintenne, when he\r\nsaw one of two Tamils, who were approaching the party, suddenly dart into\r\nthe forest and return, holding in both hands a Cobra de capello, which he\r\nhad seized by the head and tail. He called to his companion for assistance\r\nto place it in their covered basket, but in doing this, he handled it so\r\ninexpertly that it seized him by the finger, and retained its hold for a\r\nfew seconds, as if unable to retract its fangs. The blood flowed, and\r\nintense pain appeared to follow almost immediately; but with all expedition\r\nthe friend of the sufferer undid his waist-cloth, and took from it two\r\nsnake-stones, each of the size of a small almond, intensely black and\r\nhighly polished, though of an extremely light substance. These he applied,\r\none to each wound inflicted by the teeth of the serpent, to which they\r\nattached themselves closely; the blood that oozed from the bites being\r\nrapidly imbibed by the porous texture of {631}the article applied. The\r\nstones adhered tenaciously for three or four minutes, the wounded man's\r\ncompanion in the meanwhile rubbing his arm downwards from the shoulders\r\ntowards the fingers. At length the snake-stones dropped off of their own\r\naccord; the suffering of the man appeared to subside; he twisted his\r\nfingers till the joints cracked, and went on his way without concern.\r\nWhilst this had been going on, another Indian of the party, who had come\r\nup, took from his bag a small piece of white wood, which resembled a root,\r\nand passed it gently near the head of the cobra, which the latter\r\nimmediately inclined close to the ground; he then lifted the snake without\r\nhesitation, and coiled it into a circle at the bottom of his basket. The\r\nroot by which he professed to be enabled to perform this operation with\r\nsafety he called the \"Naya-thalic kalanga\" (the root of the snake-plant),\r\nprotected by which he professed his ability to approach any reptile with\r\nimpunity.\"\r\n\r\nThe following narrative, communicated to Sir E. Tennent by H. E. Reyne, of\r\nthe Department of Public Works, Colombo, seems to exclude the possibility\r\nof deception:–\r\n\r\n\"A snake-charmer came to my bungalow in 1854, requesting me to allow him to\r\nshow me his snakes dancing. As I had frequently seen them, I told him I\r\nwould give him a rupee if he would accompany me to the jungle and catch a\r\ncobra that I knew frequented the place. He was willing, and as I was\r\nanxious to test the truth of the charm, I counted his tame snakes, and put\r\na watch over them until I returned with him. Before going I examined the\r\nman, and satisfied myself he had no snake about his person. When we arrived\r\nat the spot, he played on a small pipe, and after persevering for some\r\ntime, out came a large cobra from an ant-hill, which I knew it occupied. On\r\nseeing the man it tried to escape, but he caught it by the tail and kept\r\nswinging it round until we reached the bungalow. He then made it dance, but\r\nbefore long it bit him above the knee. He immediately bandaged the leg\r\nabove the bite, and applied a snake-stone to the wound to extract the\r\npoison. He was in great pain for a few minutes, but after that it gradually\r\nwent away, the stone falling off just before he was relieved. When he\r\nrecovered he held a cloth up, which the snake flew at, and caught its fangs\r\nin it; while in that position, the man passed his hand up its back, and\r\nhaving seized it by the throat, {632}he extracted the fangs in my presence\r\nand gave them to me. He then squeezed out the poison on to a leaf. It was a\r\nclear oily substance, and when rubbed on the hand produced a fine lather. I\r\ncarefully watched the whole operation, which was also witnessed by my clerk\r\nand two or three other persons.\"\r\n\r\n_N. haje_ is the common hooded cobra of Africa, the \"Aspis,\" so called on\r\naccount of its shield or hood–the \"Spy-Slange\" of the Boers. As a rule the\r\nspectacle-marks on the neck are absent or indistinct, the general colour\r\nvaries much, either brown above, yellowish beneath, with or without brown\r\nspots; or dark brown above with yellowish spots, dark brown beneath; or\r\nblackish above and beneath. The name Spy-Slange, meaning Spitting Snake,\r\nrefers to the habit which this and other African Cobras have of letting the\r\npoison drop from the mouth like saliva when they are excited. This is not a\r\nparticularly economical habit, nor is it of the slightest use to the snake.\r\n\r\n_N._ (_Ophiophagus_ s. _Hamadryas_) _bungarus_ s. _elaps_ is the\r\n\"Hamadryad\" or \"Snake-eating Cobra\" or \"King Cobra.\" It has a well\r\ndilatable hood; the very variable coloration is yellowish to black, with or\r\nwithout an olive gloss. Many specimens have more or less distinct dark\r\ncross-bands or rings around the body, while others are olive above with\r\nblack-edged scales, and others again are very dark above and beneath. The\r\ndistinctive, specific character is the small number of scales, these\r\nforming only fifteen rows on the middle of the body, nineteen or twenty-one\r\non the dilatable neck. There is a pair of large occipital shields behind\r\nthe parietals.\r\n\r\nThis snake reaches the length, enormous for a poisonous snake, of 12 feet\r\nor more. Its size and very poisonous nature make it the curse of the\r\njungle. It ranges from India to South China, and to the Philippines. The\r\nfood seems to consist entirely of other snakes.\r\n\r\n_Sepedon haemachates_ is another hooded snake in South Africa, where it is\r\nknown as the \"Ringhals,\" _i.e._ banded neck. It differs from _Naja_ by the\r\nabsence of small teeth on the maxillaries behind the fangs, and by the\r\nstrongly keeled scales, which form nineteen rows. The general colour is\r\nblack above variegated with yellow or pale brown; the under parts are also\r\nblack, often with one or two whitish bands across the lower portion of the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n{633}The Rev. G. Fisk[191] mentions the case of two young \"Ringhals,\" of 10\r\nand 9 inches in length, having been attacked and partly devoured by a\r\nmouse, supposed to be _Dendromys melanotis_, which was put with the snakes\r\nin a band-box.  On the habits of the Ringhals see Symonds.[192]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.–_Sepedon haemachates_ (the \"Ringhals\").  × ⅕.]\r\n\r\n_Bungarus._–The scales are smooth, and form thirteen to seventeen rows. The\r\nspine is very prominent, and the median row of scales which covers the\r\nridge is much enlarged. There is no dilatable hood. In other respects\r\n_Bungarus_ is closely allied to _Naja_; about half-a-dozen species, in\r\nSouth-Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\n_B. fasciatus_ reaches a length of 5 feet. The general colour is bright\r\nyellow, alternating with blackish rings.\r\n\r\n_B. coeruleus_ s. _candidus_ is the dreaded \"Krait,\" occurring in the whole\r\nof the Indian sub-region. It is dark brown or bluish black with narrow\r\ncross-bars or white specks, or it is alternately barred brown and yellow;\r\nthe under parts are uniform white. Total length rarely 4 feet.\r\n\r\nThe \"Krait\" seems to cause more deaths in India than any other snake, since\r\nit is very common, especially in Bengal and in {634}Southern India, and\r\noften creeps into the houses. It lives chiefly on rats, lizards, and\r\nsnakes.\r\n\r\n_Callophis._–With only thirteen rows of smooth scales. The head is small,\r\nnot distinct from the neck. The small eye has a round pupil. The short tail\r\nhas two ventral rows of scales. The whole body is cylindrical. Several\r\nsmall species, one or two feet in length, in South-Eastern Asia. _C.\r\nmacclellandi_ in India and Indo-China is reddish brown above, yellow below,\r\nwith regular, equidistant, black, light-edged cross-bands or rings. Total\r\nlength up to 2 feet.\r\n\r\n_Doliophis_ differs from _Callophis_ mainly by the enormously developed\r\npoison-glands which, instead of being restricted to the head, extend along\r\nthe anterior third of the body, gradually thickening, and terminating in\r\nfront of the heart with club-shaped ends. Owing to the extension of these\r\nglands, which can be felt through the skin as thickenings at the end of the\r\nfirst third of the body, the heart has been shifted farther back than in\r\nany other snake. Several species in Indo-China and in the Malay Islands,\r\n_D. intestinalis_ with many colour-variations.\r\n\r\nAustralia suffers from an abundance of Elapine snakes, of which we will\r\nmention only the three commonest.\r\n\r\n_Pseudechis_ e.g. _Ps. porphyriaceus_, the \"Black Snake\" of Australia, has\r\nseventeen rows of smooth scales on the body, a few more on the neck, which\r\nhowever is not, or is only slightly, dilated. A few of the sub-caudal\r\nscales are undivided, the rest are paired. The head is distinct from the\r\nneck; the pupil is round. Total length up to 5 or 6 feet. The general\r\ncolour above is black, with the outer row of scales red at the base; the\r\nventral scales are red with black edges. The females are generally more\r\nbrown than black, and are therefore sometimes known as \"Brown Adders.\" They\r\nlive on small mammals, birds, lizards and other snakes.\r\n\r\n_Notechis scutatus_ s. _Hoplocephalus curtus_, the \"Tiger Snake,\" has\r\nrather small eyes with round pupils. The head is distinct from the\r\ncylindrical body, which is covered with fifteen to nineteen rows of smooth\r\nscales. The sub-caudals are single. The head of this variably coloured\r\nsnake is mostly black, the body olive brown with dark cross-bands; towards\r\nthe tail the coloration becomes more uniformly blackish. The under parts\r\nare pale {635}yellow. The range of this very common snake extends over\r\nTasmania and Australia.\r\n\r\n_Acanthophis antarcticus_, the \"Death Adder,\" is easily recognised by the\r\npeculiar tail, the end of which is laterally compressed, beset with a few\r\nrows of enlarged imbricating scales, and terminates in a thin horny spine.\r\nThe head is distinct from the neck, and flat; the eye has a vertical pupil.\r\nThe short and thick body is covered with twenty-one or twenty-three rows of\r\nkeeled scales. The anterior caudals are single, the posterior double. The\r\ncolours of the upper parts are a mixture of brown, reddish and yellow, with\r\ndark cross-bands. The belly is pale yellow, often spotted with brown or\r\nblack. The end of the tail is yellow, reddish brown or black. The total\r\nlength of this stout and ugly viviparous creature remains under 3 feet. It\r\nis widely distributed from South Australia to the Moluccas. The use of the\r\npeculiar tail very probably consists in attracting or fixing the attention\r\nof small animals; the snake, lying coiled up on a dry and sandy spot,\r\nslightly raising and vibrating the tip of the tail.\r\n\r\n_Elaps_ is an entirely American genus, with many species, most of which are\r\nextremely prettily coloured, red and black in alternate rings being a\r\nfavourite pattern. The maxillaries carry no teeth behind the poison-fangs.\r\nThe scales of the body are smooth and form fifteen rows. The tail is short.\r\nThe small eye has mostly a vertical pupil. The head is very small, not\r\ndistinct from the neck. The squamosal and quadrate bones are short, and the\r\ngape of the mouth is so limited that these beautiful snakes, although\r\npossessing strong poison, are practically harmless to man. One of the\r\nprettiest is _E. corallinus_ of the forests of Tropical South America and\r\nthe Lesser Antilles. The whole body, above and below, is adorned with about\r\ntwenty deep black rings, which are edged with yellow and again separated by\r\nred rings equalling in width the black ones. Sometimes the red rings are\r\ndotted with black, and the black dots may form additional rings between the\r\nred and the yellow. Total length under 3 feet.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 2. HYDROPHINAE (Sea-Snakes).–The tail is strongly compressed,\r\nsometimes the body also. All the scales are small, and there are often no\r\nenlarged ventrals. The eyes are small, with round pupils. All these snakes\r\nare very poisonous and live in the sea, often at considerable distances\r\nfrom the land, {636}with the exception of one species of _Distira_, _D.\r\nsemperi_, which is confined to the land-locked freshwater Lake Taal at\r\nLuzon in the Philippines. They live on fish, and range from the Persian\r\nGulf to Central America. In conformity with their absolutely aquatic life\r\nthey are viviparous, and they die when kept out of the water for any length\r\nof time. About fifty species are known.\r\n\r\n_Enhydrina valakadien s. bengalensis_ has scales with a small tubercle or\r\nkeel, which is stronger in the males; the ventrals are very small, forming\r\na scarcely enlarged series. The maxillaries carry two or more small grooved\r\nteeth in addition to the poison-fangs. The back is olive or dark grey, with\r\nblack transverse bands, which are most distinct in the young. The under\r\nparts are white. This species ranges from Persia to the Malay Islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.–_Enhydrina valakadien_ (left upper figure) and\r\n_Hydrophis obscura_ (right lower figure). × ¼.]\r\n\r\n_Hydrophis_ e.g. _H. obscura_.–The body is long; the head and neck are very\r\nslender, the body becoming much thicker farther back. The small teeth\r\nbehind the poison-fangs are not grooved. The ventral scales are very small,\r\nthe others are keeled, strongly so {637}in the males. The general\r\ncoloration of this Sea-Snake, which reaches about one yard in length, is\r\ndark olive-green above with yellowish cross-bars, which form complete rings\r\nround the slender part of the body. Other specimens are pale olive, with\r\ndark cross-bands. This species occurs in the Bay of Bengal and the Malay\r\nArchipelago.\r\n\r\nAs a rule Sea-Snakes are not found in mid-ocean. After leaving Ceylon, the\r\nsteamer meets them again in the Straits of Malacca. Those which occur near\r\nthe south coast of Japan, e.g. _Distira cyanocincta_, are found there only\r\nin the summer, and are probably carried there by the south-west monsoon.\r\n\r\nAccording to Semper the gravid female visits the shores of low islands,\r\nthere to give birth to its young between the rocks, and she remains with\r\nher offspring for some time. Semper once found a large female, probably\r\n_Platurus fasciatus_ s. _colubrinus_, coiled up amongst rocks, and between\r\nthe folds were at least twenty young, each already about 2 feet long.\r\n\r\nBoulenger[193] has written an interesting popular account of Sea-Snakes.\r\n\r\nFAM. 8. AMBLYCEPHALIDAE.–Some thirty species of Neotropical and Oriental\r\nSnakes have been separated from the Colubridae on account of the\r\npterygoids, which are widely separated from the quadrates, the posterior\r\nends of the pterygoids not reaching beyond the level of the occipital\r\ncondyle. This condition can be ascertained when the mouth is opened widely.\r\nThe prefrontals are not in contact with the nasals. The squamosals are\r\nreduced to pad-like vestiges. Externally the Amblycephalidae are easily\r\ndistinguished from the Colubridae by the absence of a longitudinal median\r\nmental groove. The head is thick, very distinct from the neck, and gives\r\nthese harmless snakes a \"poisonous\" appearance. The pupil is vertical.\r\n\r\n_Amblycephalus_, e.g. _A. monticola_.–Maxillaries short, with only five or\r\nsix teeth. Sub-caudals in two rows. Body compressed, covered with fifteen\r\nrows of scales. South-Eastern Asia.\r\n\r\nFAM. 9. VIPERIDAE.–The maxillaries are very short, movably attached to the\r\nprefrontals and ectopterygoids, so that they can be erected together with\r\nthe large poison-fangs, which (besides reserve-teeth) are the only\r\nmaxillary teeth. The prefrontals are not in contact with the nasals. The\r\nsquamosals are very loosely {638}attached. For further details see Fig.\r\n180. The poison-fangs are perforated, having a wide hole on the anterior\r\nside at the base, in connexion with the large poison-gland; the hole leads\r\ninto a canal, which opens gradually as a semi-canal on the anterior surface\r\nof the distal third or quarter of the tooth. As usual in poisonous snakes,\r\nseveral reserve-teeth are stowed away behind the acting fang. When the\r\nlatter is broken off or has served its time it is cast off at the base, and\r\nthe next reserve tooth takes its place. The supply of reserve-teeth is\r\nindefinite, half-finished teeth down to mere germs constantly growing.\r\n\r\nAll the Viperidae are very poisonous, and all, except the African\r\n_Atractaspis_, are viviparous. They include terrestrial, arboreal,\r\nsemi-aquatic, and burrowing types. The family is cosmopolitan, excepting\r\nMadagascar and the whole of the Australian region; it is divided into\r\nVipers and Pit-Vipers.\r\n\r\nSUB-FAM. 1. VIPERINAE (Vipers).–There is no sensory external pit between\r\nthe eye and the nose, and the maxillary is not hollowed out above. The\r\nVipers are absolutely restricted to the Old World, ranging over the whole\r\nof Europe, Africa, and Asia, with the exception of Madagascar; their\r\nnorthern extension is limited only by the permanently frozen condition of\r\nthe underground. Nine genera with about forty species are known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.–Map showing the distribution of the Sub-Family\r\nViperinae. Corsica and Sardinia should be black in the map.]\r\n\r\n_Causus_ with a few species in Africa and _Azemiops feae_ in Upper Burmah\r\nare the only vipers which have the head covered {639}with large symmetrical\r\nshields, while in the other genera the head-shields are broken up into\r\nscales or small shields. _Causus rhombeatus_ is very common in Africa, from\r\nthe Gambia to the Cape. It reaches a length of a little more than 2 feet.\r\nPale olive-brown above, usually with a dorsal series of large rhombic or\r\nV-shaped dark brown, sometimes white-edged spots, and with a dark\r\narrow-shaped mark on the occiput; under parts yellowish white or grey.\r\n\r\n_Bitis_ s. _Echidna_.–Very much like _Vipera_, but the nasal shields are\r\nseparated from the rostral by small scales, and the postfrontal bone is\r\nvery large.  Several species in Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 172.–_Bitis arietans_ (Puff Adder). × ¼.]\r\n\r\nThe head is very distinct from the neck, chiefly owing to the large\r\npoison-glands and to its being, like the body, much depressed. The small\r\neye has a vertical pupil, and is separated from the labials by a series of\r\nsmall scales. The scales are keeled, and form many, from twenty-nine to\r\nforty-one, rows; the tail is very short, with two rows of scales below.\r\n\r\nIn _B. arietans_, the \"Puff Adder,\" the nostrils are directed upwards. This\r\nugly brute is yellowish to orange brown above with regular, chevron-shaped\r\ndark bars or other markings, helping {640}to conceal the creature when it\r\nis lying on sandy and stony ground; the under parts are yellowish white.\r\nThe Puff Adder reaches a length of 4, or very rarely 5 feet, ranging all\r\nover Africa, except the north coast, and extending into Southern Arabia. It\r\nis very slow, and trusts to not being discovered when lying in the dry\r\ngrass; when approached it inflates the body and hisses loudly with a\r\npuffing sound, watches the enemy with raised and characteristically bent\r\nhead and neck; but it bites only when actually touched or attacked. The\r\neffect of the bite is very dangerous. Its prey consists chiefly of small\r\nmammals, which are hunted during the night.\r\n\r\n_B. (Echidna) nasicornis_, of Tropical West Africa, has two or three\r\nenlarged scales above the supranasals; they stand upon erectile tissue so\r\nas to form horn-like elevations. This \"Nose-horned Viper\" grows to a length\r\nof 4 feet, and is rather prettily marked; the ground-colour is purplish or\r\nreddish brown, with a vertebral series of large, pale, dark-edged spots and\r\noblique crosses. The young are at birth as much as one foot in length, and\r\nare very tastefully coloured.\r\n\r\n_Cerastes_ and _Echis_ prefer to burrow in sand. The lateral scales are\r\nsmaller than the dorsals, and arranged obliquely with serrated keels, so\r\nthat the snakes can cover themselves with sand by lateral shovelling\r\nmotions of the sides of the body.\r\n\r\n_Cerastes cornutus_, the \"Horned Viper\" of North-Eastern Africa, from\r\nAlgeria to Arabia, extending also into Palestine, has the sides of the\r\nventral scales bent angularly, with an obtuse keel on either side. Above\r\neach eye stands a large horny, spiky scale. The upper parts are pale\r\nyellowish brown, mostly with dark spots arranged in several longitudinal\r\nrows. The under parts are white. This, or perhaps _C. vipera_, which has no\r\nhorns, is supposed to be the species which has become famous through the\r\nsuicide of Cleopatra.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years ago a number of \"Horned Vipers\" were brought to the\r\nZoological Gardens of London, and attracted attention by their unusually\r\nlong horns. It was found that some wily Egyptian snake-catcher had tried to\r\nmanufacture a new species by taking specimens of the hornless _C. vipera_\r\nand inserting a pair of hedgehog's spines, pushing them upwards through the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThe \"Horned Viper\" attains a length of two feet and a half. {641}In the\r\ndaytime it is invisible, being buried in the sand with only the eyes,\r\nnostrils, and the \"horns\" appearing above the surface.\r\n\r\n_Vipera._–The head is distinct from the neck, and is covered with small\r\nscales and a few larger shields. The eye is separated from the labials by\r\nscales; the nasals are in contact with the rostral shield or separated by\r\none naso-rostral shield. The scales on the body are strongly keeled; they\r\nare in two rows on the short tail. This genus with about ten species ranges\r\nover Europe, Asia, and the greater part of Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 173.–_Cerastes cornutus_, the \"Horned Viper\" (right),\r\nand _Vipera ammodytes_, the \"European Nose-horned Viper\" (left). × 1.]\r\n\r\n_V. berus_, the Common European Viper (see Fig. 165, p. 620). The snout is\r\nnot turned up at the end; between the small head-scales there is generally\r\na pair of well-developed parietal and frontal shields. The scales of the\r\ntrunk form twenty-one rows. The coloration is very variable, there being\r\ngrey, brown, red, or black specimens in the same country, and the\r\nmuch-spoken-of black zigzag line along the back is so often indistinct that\r\nit is a character not to be relied upon. Usually the grey, yellowish,\r\nolive, brown or red ground-colour is set off by a dark zigzag band along\r\nthe spine, and by a series of lateral spots; an oblique or St. Andrew's\r\ncross or two diverging bold streaks of dark brown or black are usually\r\npresent on the back of the head, and there is a dark streak behind the eye.\r\nThe under parts are grey, brown, or black, uniform or speckled; the end of\r\nthe tail is usually yellow or red.\r\n\r\n{642}[Illustration: FIG. 174.–Skin of Viper. × 1. (From White's _History of\r\nSelborne_.)]\r\n\r\nAccording to Boulenger, who is making a special study of the individual\r\nvariations of Vipers (concerning colour, scaling, number of vertebrae,\r\netc.), some specimens are entirely black in the males through extension of\r\nthe black markings, in the females through darkening of the ground-colour.\r\nMales are usually distinguishable from females by darker, deep black\r\nmarkings and lighter ground-colour. The females are mostly larger than the\r\nmales. The largest specimen in the British Museum measures 700 mm. = 28\r\ninches, but a viper 2 feet long may be considered a very large specimen.\r\nThe Common Viper has a wide range, from Wales to Saghalien Island, and from\r\nCaithness to the north of Spain. It ascends the Alps to a considerable\r\naltitude, up to 6000 feet. J. Blum[194] has published an elaborate\r\nstatistical account of the Viper in Germany, unfortunately confining\r\nhimself strictly to the political frontiers. According to the map attached\r\nto his work, the Viper is common all over Germany with the exception of\r\nSouth-Western and parts of Middle Germany. It is absent in Alsace, the\r\nBavarian Palatinate, Rhenish Prussia, Hesse, the northern half of Baden,\r\nWürtemberg, and Franconia, countries which, speaking broadly, have a warm\r\nsubsoil, composed of Red Sandstone and Basaltic formation. As a rule the\r\nViper prefers heaths, moors, and mixed woods with sunny slopes. Brambles,\r\nclumps of nettles, hedges, the edges of little copses, heaps of stones, are\r\nfavourite places of retreat, affording shelter, holes, and the vicinity of\r\nmice, which form its chief sustenance. At harvest-time it is often found in\r\ncornfields, and it frequently hides in the sheaves. Vipers are fond of\r\nbasking on certain spots, on the top of a stone, the stump of a tree, or a\r\npatch of sand: a shower of rain or even passing clouds drive them back into\r\ntheir holes. They are eminently nocturnal, when they regularly \"beat\" their\r\ndistrict, biting and paralysing their prey before swallowing it. A fire\r\nkindled at night is sure to draw vipers near; the same applies to other\r\nvipers, for instance _Cerastes_, which appears in perplexing {643}numbers\r\nat the camp-fire. They cannot climb, and they avoid going into water. The\r\npairing takes place as a rule from March to May, a number of individuals,\r\nmostly males, collecting around the females, and forming entangled lumps of\r\nsnakes; parturition takes place in the following July and August. In\r\nexceptionally warm winters they have been known to pair in December, having\r\nleft their winter-quarters. They hibernate for about six months, more or\r\nless according to the climate, congregating in great numbers, sometimes in\r\ndozens. With very rare exceptions Vipers do not take food in captivity, but\r\nprefer starving themselves to death. The bite is as a rule not fatal. The\r\nseriousness of the case depends of course upon many circumstances, as for\r\ninstance the state of concentration of the venom, the position and depth of\r\nthe bite, and last but not least upon the general condition of health of\r\nthe victim. General depression aggravated by nervousness, weakness of the\r\nbitten limb, occasional breaking out of the wound, are of frequent and\r\nprotracted occurrence. (See also p. 590.)\r\n\r\n_V. aspis_ is a more southern and western European Viper, occurring from\r\nFrance to the Tyrol, and in Italy. The snout is slightly turned up at the\r\nend, and still more so in _V. latastei_ of Spain and Portugal. In _V.\r\nammodytes_, of South-Eastern Europe, the raised portion is produced into a\r\nsoft, scaly appendage (see the lower figure on p. 641). Vipers are\r\nsometimes unpleasantly common in certain localities. This was for instance\r\nthe case at the drill-ground near Metz, and the military authorities paid a\r\nprice for each viper delivered to them. The supply of the latter increased\r\nto an alarming extent until the German authorities discovered that a\r\nregular trade had been established across the frontier, and that the French\r\nLorrainers were importing vipers briskly.\r\n\r\n_V. russelli_, the \"Daboia\" or Russell's Viper, is one of the scourges of\r\nIndia, Ceylon, Burma, and Siam. The scales form about thirty rows on the\r\nbody. The upper surface of the head is covered with small, imbricating,\r\nusually keeled scales. The general colour is pale brown above with three\r\nlongitudinal series of black, light-edged rings, which sometimes encircle\r\nreddish spots. The under parts are yellowish white, uniform, or with small\r\ncrescentic black spots. Total length up to about 5 feet. The poisoning\r\nsymptoms are described on p. 590.\r\n\r\n{644}SUB-FAM. 2. CROTALINAE (\"Pit-Vipers\").–With a deep cavity or pit\r\nbetween the eye and the nose, lodged in the hollowed-out maxillary bone.\r\nThis pit is lined with a modified continuation of the epidermis, and is\r\namply supplied with branches from the trigeminal nerve. It is undoubtedly\r\nsensory, but we do not know its function. A good anatomical account of this\r\norgan has been given by West.[195] Some of the Pit-Vipers have a rattle at\r\nthe end of the tail; these are the Rattle-Snakes. The rattle is composed of\r\na number of horny bells which fit into each other. The oldest or terminal\r\nbell is in reality the horny covering of the tip of the tail, and with each\r\nmoult or shedding of the skin the youngest bell becomes loose, but is held\r\nby the new covering which has been developed in the meantime. There is thus\r\nproduced an ever-increasing number of loosely-jointed bells, but now and\r\nthen most or all the bells break off, probably when they are worn out, and\r\na new set is gradually developed. Rattles with a dozen bells are, for\r\ninstance, very rare. They naturally increase in bulk with the age of the\r\nsnake, but the number of joints is no indication of the snake's age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 175.–Rattle of Rattle-Snake. (From White's _History of\r\nSelborne_.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 176.–Map showing the distribution of the Sub-Family\r\nCrotalinae.]\r\n\r\nPit-Vipers have a very wide distribution. They are divided into four genera\r\nwith about sixty species. Rattle-Snakes are {645}restricted to America, but\r\nother Pit-Vipers occur in North and South America and in the southern half\r\nof Asia.\r\n\r\n_Ancistrodon._–Without a rattle. The upper surface of the head is covered\r\nwith nine large shields, but the internasals and prefrontals are sometimes\r\nbroken up into scales. The scales of the body have apical, sensory pits.\r\nAbout ten species, some in Central and North America, others in the Caspian\r\ndistrict (_A. halys_), in the Himalayas (_A. himalayanus_), in Ceylon,\r\nJava, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 177.–_Ancistrodon piscivorus_ (Water-Viper). × ¼.]\r\n\r\n_A. piscivorus_ s. _Trigonocephalus cenchris_ (part), the \"Water-Viper,\"\r\ninhabits North America from Carolina and Indiana to Florida and Texas. The\r\ngeneral colour is reddish to dark brown, with darker cross-bands or with\r\nC-shaped markings; a dark, light-edged band extends from the eye to the\r\nangle of the mouth. The under parts are yellowish, spotted with black, or\r\nthe latter is the prevailing colour. Total length up to 5 feet. The\r\nWater-Viper is semi-aquatic and lives chiefly on fishes, but it also eats\r\nother snakes and various Amphibia, Birds, and Mammals. This snake is very\r\ngood-humoured in captivity, and becomes {646}easily tame. A gentleman in\r\nBerlin, rather too much addicted to making pets of poisonous snakes, had a\r\npair which propagated regularly. When I was a boy he invited me to feed the\r\nyoung Water-Vipers with fishes cut into strips, and I enjoyed this\r\nimmensely until he warned me not to touch the mother, which might bite\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 178.–_Ancistrodon contortrix_ (Moccasin-Snake or\r\nCopper-head). × ¼.]\r\n\r\n_A. contortrix_ s. _Trigonocephalus cenchris_ (part), the \"Moccasin-Snake\"\r\nor \"Copper-head,\" is one of the few poisonous snakes which possess a loreal\r\nshield, _i.e._ a shield intercalated between the pre-oculars and the\r\nnasals; below it lies the pit. The general colour is yellowish to pink or\r\npale brown, with dark brown or red cross-bars or triangular marks. The\r\nunder surface is yellowish or reddish, speckled with grey or brown, and\r\nwith a lateral series of large blackish spots. Total length of full-grown\r\nspecimens about one yard. The Moccasin-Snake ranges from Massachusetts and\r\nKansas to Northern Florida and Texas. It prefers swampy localities or\r\nmeadows with high grass, where it hunts for small Mammals and Birds.\r\n\r\n_Lachesis._–Without a rattle.  The upper surface of the head is covered\r\nwith very small shields or with scales. About forty {647}species in\r\nSouth-Eastern Asia and in Central and South America.\r\n\r\n_L._ (_Bothrops_ s. _Craspedocephalus_) _lanceolatus_ inhabits nearly the\r\nwhole of South America, extending into Mexico and the Lower Antilles,\r\n_e.g._ Martinique, Guadaloupe, and Santa Lucia, where it is known as the\r\n\"Fer-de-Lance,\" and is the curse of the sugar-plantations on account of its\r\nbeing so very common and so deadly poisonous. The Mongoose was introduced\r\nas a possible antagonist, but the little Indian Mammal wisely left the\r\ndangerous reptile alone, and has in some places established himself as\r\nanother pest–as a destroyer of poultry. The Fer-de-Lance grows to a length\r\nof 6 feet, establishes itself everywhere–in swamps, plantations, forests,\r\nin the plains and in the hills–and is very prolific, producing, according\r\nto its size, dozens of young which are 10 inches long, very active and\r\nsnappy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 179.–Head of _Lachesis lanceolatus_ after removal of\r\nthe skin. × 1. _D_, Duct, bent upon itself, from the poison-gland into the\r\ntooth; _Dig_, digastric muscle or opener of the jaw; _N_, nostril; _P.G_,\r\npoison-gland; _S.Gr_, sensory groove or pit; _S.Q_, point of junction of\r\nthe squamosal and quadrate; _T.a_, _Temp.a_, anterior, and _T.p_,\r\nposterior, temporal muscle.]\r\n\r\n_L._ (_Trimeresurus_) _gramineus_ s. _viridis_, to mention one Asiatic\r\nspecies, grows to less than 3 feet in length, is bright green above,\r\nsometimes with faint blackish bars; green, yellow, or whitish below, and\r\nwith a light streak along the outer row of scales. The end of the tail is\r\nusually bright red. This beautiful snake has a prehensile tail and is\r\narboreal. Its range extends over the whole of India, to Hong-Kong and to\r\nTimor, and even into the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\r\n\r\n_Sistrurus._–With a rattle. The upper surface of the head is covered with\r\nnine large shields. A few species in North America east of the Rocky\r\nMountains, e.g. _S. miliarius_.\r\n\r\n{648}_Crotalus._–With a rattle. The upper surface of the head is covered\r\nwith small scales. Range from Southern Canada and British Columbia to\r\nNorthern Argentina, but not in the West Indian Islands. About ten, mostly\r\nclosely-allied species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 180.–Skull of a Rattle-Snake, _Crotalus durissus_. × 1.\r\nA, Lateral view, jaws slightly opened; B, ventral view; C, lateral view,\r\nthe jaws opened fully in the position of striking; D, dorsal view.

Very large Rattle-Snakes, _C. durissus_,\r\nattain a length of 8 feet, others not often more than five. They prey\r\nchiefly upon small Mammals, hunting for them at night. In the daytime they\r\nare also about, mainly in order to bask. Although they occasionally take to\r\nthe water in pursuit of their prey, they dislike being wetted by rain,\r\nwithdrawing then into their holes, appropriating as a rule those of\r\nground-squirrels, rats, and Prairie-dogs. The often-repeated story about\r\nRattle-Snakes living in neighbourly friendship in the holes of\r\nPrairie-dogs, together with the little Prairie-owls, is an exaggeration. We\r\ndo not know how many of the original inmates are eaten. Pairing takes place\r\nin the spring. During the cold months they hibernate under ground, often in\r\nconsiderable numbers.\r\n\r\nRattle-Snakes have few enemies besides man and pigs. The latter kill and\r\neat them wherever they can. The rattle is decidedly useful to the snake as\r\nan instrument of warning off any approaching possible enemy, since no snake\r\nlikes to bite unless in self-defence or in order to kill its prey. The\r\nnoise of the rattle is very loud in dry weather, much duller on clammy\r\ndays; it is a shrill sound like that of a rattling alarm-clock, and a\r\nwell-conditioned snake in a room can make conversation well-nigh\r\nimpossible, and can keep on rattling for half an hour or longer. The rattle\r\nis kept in such rapid lateral vibrations that it shows only a blurred\r\nimage, the rattle standing with its broader sides vertically, not\r\nhorizontally. They endure captivity for many years, and become tame enough\r\nnot to hiss and to rattle whenever they are approached.\r\n\r\n_C. horridus_ is grey-brown above, usually with a rusty vertebral stripe\r\nand with V- or M-shaped blackish cross-bands; the under surface is\r\nyellowish; the end of the tail is blackish. The supra-ocular shields are\r\nsmooth and much narrower than the scaly space between them, and there is\r\nonly one pair of internasals.\r\n\r\n_C. durissus_ s. _adamanteus_ differs from the previous species chiefly by\r\npossessing two pairs of internasals; and the dark {650}markings on the body\r\nform a handsome pattern of rhombs with lighter centres and yellowish edges.\r\nThis is the largest species of Rattle-Snake, reaching a length of 8 feet.\r\n\r\n_C. confluentus_ has broader, transversely striated, supra-ocular shields.\r\nThe specific name refers to the continuous series of large brown or red\r\nrhomboidal spots on the back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 181.–_Crotalus durissus_ s. _adamanteus_\r\n(Rattle-Snake). × ¼.]\r\n\r\n_C. terrificus_ ranges from Arizona to Argentina, and is the only species\r\nof Rattle-Snake in South America. It differs from the others by having a\r\npair of prefrontal shields behind the pair of internasals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{651}INDEX\r\n\r\n  Every reference is to the page: words in italics are names

The illustrations are excellent.\"\r\n\r\n  _FIELD._–\"The book can be in the strongest manner recommended to those\r\n  for whose benefit it has been written. We know of no work from which a\r\n  more truly scientific account of the Protozoa, Echinodermata, and other\r\n  lower forms of animal life could be gained.\"\r\n\r\n  _OUTLOOK._–\"There is much valuable matter in these well-planned sections\r\n  which will render the volume, like the others which have preceded it, a\r\n  necessary book of reference in every well-equipped library.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWORMS, ROTIFERS, AND POLYZOA\r\n\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\n  FLATWORMS AND MESOZOA, by F.

HARMER, Sc.D., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  _CAMBRIDGE REVIEW._–\"Several of the groups treated of in this volume are\r\n  unknown, by sight even, to the general reader, and possess no popular\r\n  name whatsoever; and as only a few insignificant details are known of the\r\n  habits of the animals composing them, their treatment in the volume\r\n  before us has necessarily been to a large extent anatomical. This\r\n  circumstance renders the book of especial value to students, more\r\n  particularly as in some cases the articles on the groups in question are\r\n  the first comprehensive ones dealing with their respective subjects....\r\n  Most of the articles are of a very high order of merit–taken as a whole,\r\n  it may be said that they are by far the best which have as yet been\r\n  published.... We may say with confidence that the same amount of\r\n  information, within the same compass, is to be had in no other zoological\r\n  work.\"\r\n\r\n  _NATURAL SCIENCE._–\"This second volume of the Cambridge Natural History\r\n  is certain to prove a most welcome addition to English Zoological\r\n  literature. It deals with a series of animal groups, all deeply\r\n  interesting to the specialist in morphology; some important from their\r\n  economic relations to other living things, others in their life-histories\r\n  rivalling the marvels of fairy-tales. And the style in which they are\r\n  here treated is also interesting; history and the early observations of\r\n  the older writers lend their charm; accounts of habits and mode of\r\n  occurrence, of life, in a word, from the cradle to the grave, are given\r\n  in ample detail, accompanied by full references to modern and current\r\n  literature. The whole is admirably illustrated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMOLLUSCS AND BRACHIOPODS\r\n\r\nVOLUME III.\r\n\r\n  MOLLUSCS, by the Rev. A. H. COOKE, M.A.; BRACHIOPODS (RECENT), by A.

REED, M.A.\r\n\r\n  _TIMES._–\"There are very many, not only among educated people who take an\r\n  interest in science, but even among specialists, who will welcome a work\r\n  of reasonable compass and handy form containing a trustworthy treatment\r\n  of the various departments of Natural History by men who are familiar\r\n  with, and competent to deal with, the latest results of scientific\r\n  research. Altogether, to judge from this first volume, the Cambridge\r\n  Natural History promises to fulfil all the expectations that its\r\n  prospectus holds out.\"\r\n\r\n  _FIELD._–\"We know of no book available to the general reader which\r\n  affords such a vast fund of information on the structure and habits of\r\n  molluscs.\"\r\n\r\n  _KNOWLEDGE._–\"If succeeding volumes are like this one, the Cambridge\r\n  Natural History will rank as one of the finest works on natural history\r\n  ever published.\"\r\n\r\n  _ATHENÆUM._–\"The series certainly ought not to be restricted in its\r\n  circulation to lecturers and students only; and, if the forthcoming\r\n  volumes reach the standard of the one here under notice, the success of\r\n  the enterprise should be assured.\"\r\n\r\nVOLUME IV.\r\n\r\n  CRUSTACEA, by GEOFFREY SMITH, M.A.; TRILOBITES, ETC., by H.

When its successor appears, and I will\r\n  venture to express the hope that this will be at no very distant period,\r\n  we shall be in possession of a treatise on the natural history of insects\r\n  which, from the point of view of the general reader, will compare most\r\n  favourably with any similar work that has been published in the English\r\n  language.\"\r\n\r\n  _ENTOMOLOGISTS MONTHLY MAGAZINE._–\"We venture to think the work will be\r\n  found indispensable to all who seek to extend their general knowledge\r\n  beyond the narrowing influence of exclusive attention to certain orders\r\n  or groups, and that it will take a high position in 'The Cambridge\r\n  Natural History' series.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS–PART II.\r\n\r\nVOLUME VI.\r\n\r\n  HYMENOPTERA _continued_ (TUBULIFERA AND ACULEATA), COLEOPTERA,\r\n  STREPSIPTERA, LEPIDOPTERA, DIPTERA, APHANIPTERA, THYSANOPTERA, HEMIPTERA,\r\n  ANOPLURA, by DAVID SHARP, M.A., M.B., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  _SATURDAY REVIEW._–\"Dr. Sharp's treatment is altogether worthy of the\r\n  series and of his own high scientific reputation. But in a work of this\r\n  sort it is not only necessary that information should be accurate, but\r\n  also that it shall be presented to the eye, so far as illustrations and\r\n  printing are concerned, in such a way as to render its matter as easily\r\n  intelligible as possible, and readily usable for purposes of reference.\r\n  Under both these heads we have nothing but commendation for Mr. Sharp's\r\n  treatise. The illustrations are indeed beautiful, and the use of the\r\n  heavy type for the headings of the various sections and leading\r\n  paragraphs materially helps the reader in the progress of his study.\r\n  Certainly this is a book that should be in every entomologist's library.\"\r\n\r\n  _DAILY NEWS._–\"It would be hard to say too much in praise of this most\r\n  admirable volume. It is too often the case that scientific books are\r\n  written in a dull and uninteresting style. The reader will find nothing\r\n  of that kind to complain of here. The descriptions are clear, the\r\n  illustrations are excellent; while, as in the previous volumes of the\r\n  series, printing and paper are all that could be desired.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFISHES, ASCIDIANS, etc.\r\n\r\nVOLUME VII.\r\n\r\n  HEMICHORDATA, by S. F. HARMER, Sc.D., F.R.S.; ASCIDIANS AND AMPHIOXUS, by\r\n  W. A. HERDMAN, D.Sc., F.R.S.; FISHES (EXCLUSIVE OF THE SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT\r\n  OF TELEOSTEI), by T. W. BBIDGE[**BRIDGE??], Sc.D., F.R.S.; FISHES\r\n  (SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNT OF TELEOSTEI), by G. A. BOULENGER, F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  _ATHENÆUM._–\"All who take a serious interest in the advance of\r\n  ichthyology will find this a fascinating book.\"\r\n\r\n  _NATURE NOTES._–\"It is a thoroughly scholarly work for students, amply\r\n  sustaining the reputation of an ancient university as being in the van of\r\n  scientific progress.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAMPHIBIA AND REPTILES\r\n\r\nVOLUME VIII.\r\n\r\n  By HANS GADOW, M.A., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  _FIELD._–\"The work is worthy of the series in which it appears, and we\r\n  cannot give it higher praise.\"\r\n\r\n  _SCIENCE GOSSIP._–\"More than maintains the high scientific reputation of\r\n  this series. The herpetologists, or students of the Amphibia and\r\n  Reptiles, have now a standard work of the highest class.\"\r\n\r\n  _LANCET._–\"An account of both Amphibia and Reptiles which should satisfy\r\n  the expert, and at the same time entertain the reader who is merely\r\n  interested in the tit-bits of natural history.... A book full of accurate\r\n  information and pleasant reading.\"\r\n\r\n  _MORNING POST._–\"A delightful as well as a serviceable book.... Herein\r\n  perhaps lies the great charm and merit of Dr. Gadow's book, that, while\r\n  satisfying all the inquiries of the student, it is also in great part\r\n  written for the ordinary intelligence, and the naturalist in the crowd\r\n  may, while necessarily gliding over distressing technicalities, find in\r\n  its pages many hours of profitable and entertaining study of the habits\r\n  of the classes under notice.\"\r\n\r\n  _NATURE._–\"In concluding the review we would express the opinion that by\r\n  this handsome volume a very important addition to science has been made;\r\n  that the beautiful illustrations, together with the clear and charming\r\n  accounts of the life-histories which it contains, will do much to\r\n  popularise the study of a rather neglected section of zoology; and that\r\n  lovers of Reptiles, of which there are more than one generally thinks,\r\n  will feel that the new knowledge imparted to them emanates from one who\r\n  is thoroughly in sympathy with their enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDS\r\n\r\nVOLUME IX.\r\n\r\n  By A. H. EVANS, M.A.\r\n\r\n  _IBIS._–\"Mr. Evans has produced a book full of concentrated essence of\r\n  information on birds, especially as regards their outer structure and\r\n  habits, and one that we can cordially recommend as a work of reference to\r\n  all students of ornithology.\"\r\n\r\n  _NATURE NOTES._–\"We venture to predict that, of the ten volumes of which\r\n  this excellent series is planned to consist, none will secure a wider\r\n  popularity than Mr. Evans's treatise on birds. Strange as it may appear,\r\n  among the many books on birds that have appeared of late years, we do not\r\n  recall any that covers the same ground.... We are grateful to the author\r\n  for the mine of valuable information which he has crowded between his two\r\n  covers.\"\r\n\r\n  _SCIENCE GOSSIP._–\"General readers will find this work most useful in\r\n  obtaining a proper understanding of birds, and will be assisted by the\r\n  effective diagram of a hawk in the introduction, showing the recognised\r\n  names of every part of the exterior appearance. The expressions used in\r\n  naming the various portions are fully explained on the adjoining page. As\r\n  we have already said, the illustrations are admirable. The book is a\r\n  useful addition to any library, as it treats of nearly every known kind\r\n  of bird throughout the world.\"\r\n\r\n  _SATURDAY REVIEW._–\"The expert and the novice alike must be at once\r\n  delighted by the accuracy and the beauty of the illustrations.... It is\r\n  astonishing to note the mass of information the author has been able to\r\n  bring together.... With a little practice any observant person would soon\r\n  learn by the help of this volume to track down any bird very nearly to\r\n  its ultimate place in classification.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMAMMALIA\r\n\r\nVOLUME X.\r\n\r\n  By FRANK EVERS BEDDARD, M.A., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n  _NATURE._–\"Cannot fail to be of very high value to all students of the\r\n  Mammalia, especially from the standpoints of morphology and\r\n  palæontology.\"\r\n\r\n  _ATHENÆUM._–\"Mr. Beddard has produced a volume equal in interest and\r\n  value to the others in the Cambridge series.\"\r\n\r\n  _LAND AND WATER._–\"A notable book, the result of long study, patient\r\n  labour, sound reasoning, and careful selection, for which we are deeply\r\n  indebted to the author.\"\r\n\r\n  _DAILY NEWS._–\"A volume which, for the interest of its contents and for\r\n  its style and method of treatment, is not only worthy of its\r\n  predecessors, but may be regarded as one of the most successful of a\r\n  brilliant series.\"\r\n\r\n  _KNOWLEDGE._–\"In this volume Mr. Beddard has undoubtedly made an\r\n  important contribution to the history of mammals, his text-book being the\r\n  only one which can be said to be up to date and to contain notices of the\r\n  many important types–both recent and fossil–discovered during the last\r\n  few years.\"\r\n\r\n  _FIELD._–\"Its utility to the working zoological student can hardly be\r\n  overrated.
