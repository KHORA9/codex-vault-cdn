Galen's merit\r\nis to have crystallised or brought to a focus all the best work of the\r\nGreek medical schools which had preceded his own time. It is\r\nessentially in the form of Galenism that Greek medicine was\r\ntransmitted to after ages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Beginnings of Medicine in Greece.]\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks referred the origins of medicine to a god Asklepios\r\n(called in Latin Aesculapius), thereby testifying to their\r\nappreciation of the truly divine function of the healing art. The\r\nemblem of Aesculapius, familiar in medical symbolism at the present\r\nday, was a staff with a serpent coiled round it, the animal typifying\r\nwisdom in general, and more particularly the wisdom of the\r\nmedicine-man, with his semi-miraculous powers over life and death.\r\n\r\n\"_Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves._\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Asclepiea or Health-Temples.]\r\n\r\nThe temples of Aesculapius were scattered over the ancient Hellenic\r\nworld. To them the sick and ailing resorted in crowds. The treatment,\r\nwhich was in the hands of an hereditary priesthood, combined the best\r\nof the methods carried on at our present-day health-resorts, our\r\nhydropathics, sanatoriums, and nursing-homes. Fresh air, water-cures,\r\nmassage, gymnastics, psychotherapy, and natural methods in general\r\nwere chiefly relied on.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hippocrates and the Unity of the Organism.]\r\n\r\nHippocrates, the \"Father of Medicine\" (5th to 4th centuries, B.C.) was\r\nassociated with the Asclepieum of Cos, an island off the south-west\r\ncoast of Asia Minor, near Rhodes. He apparently revitalized the work\r\nof the health-temples, which had before his time been showing a\r\ncertain decline in vigour, coupled with a corresponding excessive\r\ntendency towards sophistry and priestcraft.\r\n\r\nCelsus says: \"_Hippocrates Cous primus quidem ex omnibus memoria\r\ndignis ab studio sapientiae disciplinam hanc separavit_.\" He means\r\nthat Hippocrates first gave the physician an independent standing,\r\nseparating him from the cosmological speculator. Hippocrates confined\r\nthe medical man to medicine. He did with medical thought what Socrates\r\ndid with thought in general--he \"brought it down from heaven to\r\nearth.\" His watchword was \"Back to Nature!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time, while assigning the physician his post, Hippocrates\r\nwould not let him regard that post as sacrosanct. He set his face\r\nagainst any tendency to mystery-mongering, to exclusiveness, to\r\nsacerdotalism. He was, in fact, opposed to the spirit of\r\ntrade-unionism in medicine. His concern was rather with the\r\nphysician's duties than his \"rights.\"\r\n\r\nAt the dawn of recorded medical history Hippocrates stands for the\r\nfundamental and primary importance of _seeing clearly_--that is of\r\n_clinical observation_. And what he observed was that the human\r\norganism, when exposed to certain abnormal conditions--certain\r\nstresses--tends to behave in a certain way: that in other words, each\r\n\"disease\" tends to run a certain definite course. To him a disease was\r\nessentially a process, one and indivisible, and thus his practical\r\nproblem was essentially one of _prognosis_--\"what will be the natural\r\ncourse of this disease, if left to itself?\" Here he found himself to\r\nno small extent in opposition with the teaching of the neighbouring\r\nmedical school of Cnidus, where a more static view-point laid special\r\nemphasis upon the minutiae of _diagnosis_.\r\n\r\nObservation taught Hippocrates to place unbounded faith in the\r\nrecuperative powers of the living organism--in what we sometimes call\r\nnowadays the _vis medicatrix Naturae_. His observation was that even\r\nwith a very considerable \"abnormality\" of environmental stress the\r\norganism, in the large majority of cases, manages eventually by its\r\nown inherent powers to adjust itself to the new conditions. \"Merely\r\ngive Nature a chance,\" said the father of medicine in effect, \"and\r\nmost diseases will cure themselves.\" And accordingly his treatment\r\nwas mainly directed towards \"giving Nature a chance.\"\r\n\r\nHis keen sense of the solidarity (or rather, of the constant\r\ninterplay) between the organism and its environment (the \"conditions\"\r\nto which it is exposed) is instanced in his book, \"Airs, Waters, and\r\nPlaces.\" As we recognise, in our popular everyday psychology, that \"it\r\ntakes two to make a quarrel,\" so Hippocrates recognised that in\r\npathology, it takes two (organism and environment) to make a disease.\r\n\r\nAs an outstanding example of his power of clinical observation we may\r\nrecall the _facies Hippocratica_, an accurate study of the countenance\r\nof a dying man.\r\n\r\nHis ideals for the profession are embodied in the \"Hippocratic oath.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anatomy.]\r\n\r\nImpressed by this view of the organism as a unity, the Hippocratic\r\nschool tended in some degree to overlook the importance of its\r\nconstituent _parts_. The balance was re-adjusted later on by the\r\nlabours of the anatomical school of Alexandria, which, under the aegis\r\nof the enlightened Ptolemies, arose in the 3rd century B.C. Two\r\nprominent exponents of anatomy belonging to this school were\r\nHerophilus and Erasistratus, the latter of whom we shall frequently\r\nmeet with in the following pages (_v._ p. 95 _et seq._).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Empirics.]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of the Master, the Hippocratic school tended, as so\r\noften happens with the best of cultural movements, to show signs\r\nitself of diminishing vitality: the letter began to obscure and hamper\r\nthe spirit. The comparatively small element of theory which existed in\r\nthe Hippocratic physiology was made the groundwork of a somewhat\r\nover-elaborated \"system.\" Against this tendency on the part of the\r\n\"Dogmatic\" or \"Rationalist\" school there arose, also at Alexandria,\r\nthe sect of the Empiricists. \"It is not,\" they said, \"the cause but\r\nthe cure of diseases that concerns us; not how we digest, but what is\r\ndigestible.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Greek Medicine in Rome.]\r\n\r\nHorace said \"_Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit_.\" Political\r\ndomination, the occupation of territory by armies, does not\r\nnecessarily mean real conquest. Horace's statement applied to medicine\r\nas to other branches of culture.\r\n\r\nThe introducer of Greek medicine into Rome was Asclepiades (1st\r\ncentury B.C.). A man of forceful personality, and equipped with a\r\nfully developed philosophic system of health and disease which\r\ncommended itself to the Roman _savants_ of the day, he soon attained\r\nto the pinnacle of professional success in the Latin capital: he is\r\nindeed to all time the type of the fashionable (and somewhat \"faddy\")\r\nWest-end physician. His system was a purely mechanistic one, being\r\nbased upon the atomic doctrine of Leucippus and Democritus, which had\r\nbeen completed by Epicurus and recently introduced to the Roman public\r\nin Lucretius's great poem \"_De Rerum Natura_.\" The disbelief of\r\nAsclepiades in the self-maintaining powers of the living organism are\r\nexposed and refuted at considerable length by Galen in the volume\r\nbefore us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Methodists.]\r\n\r\nOut of the teaching of Asclepiades that physiological processes depend\r\nupon the particular way in which the ultimate indivisible molecules\r\ncome together ([Greek: en tê poia synodô tôn prôtôn ekeinôn sômatôn\r\ntôn apathôn]) there was developed by his pupil, Themison of Laodicea,\r\na system of medicine characterised by the most engaging simplicity\r\nboth of diagnosis and treatment. This so-called \"Methodic\" system was\r\nintended to strike a balance between the excessive leaning to\r\napriorism shown by the Rationalist (Hippocratic) school and the\r\nopposite tendency of the Empiricists. \"A pathological theory we must\r\nhave,\" said the Methodists in effect, \"but let it be simple.\" They\r\nheld that the molecular groups constituting the tissues were traversed\r\nby minute channels ([Greek: poroi], \"pores\"); all diseases belonged to\r\none or other of two classes; if the channels were constricted the\r\ndisease was one of _stasis_ ([Greek: stegnôsis]), and if they were\r\ndilated the disease was one of _flux_ ([Greek: rhysis]). Flux and\r\nstasis were indicated respectively by increase and diminution of the\r\nnatural secretions; treatment was of opposites by opposites--of\r\nstasis by methods causing dilatation of the channels, and conversely.\r\n\r\nWild as it may seem, this pathological theory of the Methodists\r\ncontained an element of truth; in various guises it has cropped up\r\nonce and again at different epochs of medical history; even to-day\r\nthere are pathologists who tend to describe certain classes of disease\r\nin terms of vaso-constriction and vaso-dilatation. The vice of the\r\nMethodist teaching was that it looked on a disease too much as\r\nsomething fixed and finite, an independent _entity_, to be considered\r\nentirely apart from its particular setting. The Methodists illustrate\r\nfor us the tyranny of _names_. In its defects as in its virtues this\r\nschool has analogues at the present day; we are all acquainted with\r\nthe medical man to whom a name (such, let us say, as \"tuberculosis,\"\r\n\"gout,\" or \"intestinal auto-intoxication\") stands for an entity, one\r\nand indivisible, to be treated by a definite and unvarying formula.\r\n\r\nTo such an individual the old German saying \"_Jedermann hat am Ende\r\nein Bischen Tuberkulose_\" is simply--incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen.]\r\n\r\nAll the medical schools which I have mentioned were still holding\r\ntheir ground in the 2nd century A.D., with more or less popular\r\nacceptance, when the great Galen made his entry into the world of\r\nGraeco-Roman medicine.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: His Nature and Nurture.]\r\n\r\nClaudius Galenus was born at Pergamos in Asia Minor in the year\r\nA.D. His father was one Nicon, a well-to-do architect of that city. \"I\r\nhad the great good fortune,\" says Galen,[1] \"to have as a father a\r\nhighly amiable, just, good, and benevolent man. My mother, on the\r\nother hand, possessed a very bad temper; she used sometimes to bite\r\nher serving-maids, and she was perpetually shouting at my father and\r\nquarrelling with him--worse than Xanthippe with Socrates. When,\r\ntherefore, I compared the excellence of my father's disposition with\r\nthe disgraceful passions of my mother, I resolved to embrace and love\r\nthe former qualities, and to avoid and hate the latter.\"\r\n\r\nNicon called his son [Greek: Galênos], which means _quiet, peaceable_,\r\nand although the physician eventually turned out to be a man of\r\nelevated character, it is possible that his somewhat excessive leaning\r\ntowards controversy (exemplified in the following pages) may have\r\nresulted from the fact that he was never quite able to throw off the\r\nworst side of the maternal inheritance.\r\n\r\nHis father, a man well schooled in mathematics and philosophy, saw to\r\nit that his son should not lack a liberal education. Pergamos itself\r\nwas an ancient centre of civilisation, containing, among other\r\nculture-institutions, a library only second in importance to that of\r\nAlexandria itself; it also contained an Asclepieum.\r\n\r\nGalen's training was essentially eclectic: he studied all the chief\r\nphilosophical systems of the time--Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, and\r\nEpicurean--and then, at the age of seventeen, entered on a course of\r\nmedical studies; these he pursued under the best teachers at his own\r\ncity, and afterwards, during a period of _Wanderjahre_, at Smyrna,\r\nAlexandria, and other leading medical centres.\r\n\r\nReturning to Pergamos, he received his first professional\r\nappointment--that of surgeon to the gladiators. After four years here\r\nhe was drawn by ambition to Rome, being at that time about thirty-one\r\nyears of age. At Rome the young Pergamene attained a brilliant\r\nreputation both as a practitioner and as a public demonstrator of\r\nanatomy; among his patients he finally numbered even the Emperor\r\nMarcus Aurelius himself.\r\n\r\nMedical practice in Rome at this time was at a low ebb, and Galen took\r\nno pains to conceal his contempt for the ignorance, charlatanism, and\r\nvenality of his fellow-practitioners. Eventually, in spite of his\r\nsocial popularity, he raised up such odium against himself in medical\r\ncircles, that he was forced to flee the city. This he did hurriedly\r\nand secretly in the year 168 A.D., when thirty-six years of age. He\r\nbetook himself to his old home at Pergamos, where he settled down once\r\nmore to a literary life.\r\n\r\nHis respite was short, however, for within a year he was summoned back\r\nto Italy by imperial mandate. Marcus Aurelius was about to undertake\r\nan expedition against the Germans, who at that time were threatening\r\nthe northern frontiers of the Empire, and he was anxious that his\r\nconsulting physician should accompany him to the front. \"Patriotism\"\r\nin this sense, however, seems to have had no charms for the Pergamene,\r\nand he pleaded vigorously to be excused. Eventually, the Emperor gave\r\nhim permission to remain at home, entrusting to his care the young\r\nprince Commodus.\r\n\r\nThereafter we know little of Galen's history, beyond the fact that he\r\nnow entered upon a period of great literary activity. Probably he died\r\nabout the end of the century.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Subsequent History of Galen's Works.]\r\n\r\nGalen wrote extensively, not only on anatomy, physiology, and medicine\r\nin general, but also on logic; his logical proclivities, as will be\r\nshown later, are well exemplified in his medical writings. A\r\nconsiderable number of undoubtedly genuine works of his have come down\r\nto us. The full importance of his contributions to medicine does not\r\nappear to have been recognized till some time after his death, but\r\neventually, as already pointed out, the terms Galenism and Greek\r\nmedicine became practically synonymous.\r\n\r\nA few words may be devoted to the subsequent history of his writings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Byzantine Medicine.]\r\n\r\nDuring and after the final break-up of the Roman Empire came times or\r\nconfusion and of social reconstruction, which left little opportunity\r\nfor scientific thought and research. The Byzantine Empire, from the\r\n4th century onwards, was the scene of much internal turmoil, in which\r\nthe militant activities of the now State-established Christian church\r\nplayed a not inconsiderable part. The Byzantine medical scholars\r\nwere at best compilers, and a typical compiler was Oribasius,\r\nbody-physician to the Emperor Julian (4th century, A.D.); his\r\nexcellent _Synopsis_ was written in order to make the huge mass of\r\nthe Galenic writings available for the ordinary practitioner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arabian Medicine.]\r\n\r\nGreek medicine spread, with general Greek culture, throughout Syria,\r\nand from thence was carried by the Nestorians, a persecuted heretical\r\nsect, into Persia; here it became implanted, and hence eventually\r\nspread to the Mohammedan world. Several of the Prophet's successors\r\n(such as the Caliphs Harun-al-Rashid and Abdul-Rahman III) were great\r\npatrons of Greek learning, and especially of medicine. The Arabian\r\nscholars imbibed Aristotle and Galen with avidity. A partial\r\nassimilation, however, was the farthest stage to which they could\r\nattain; with the exception of pharmacology, the Arabians made\r\npractically no independent additions to medicine. They were\r\nessentially systematizers and commentators. \"_Averrois che il gran\r\ncomento feo_\"[2] may stand as the type _par excellence_ of the Moslem\r\nsage.\r\n\r\nAvicenna (Ebn Sina), (10th to 11th century) is the foremost name in\r\nArabian medicine: his \"Book of the Canon in Medicine,\" when translated\r\ninto Latin, even overshadowed the authority of Galen himself for some\r\nfour centuries. Of this work the medical historian Max Neuburger says:\r\n\"Avicenna, according to his lights, imparted to contemporary medical\r\nscience the appearance of almost mathematical accuracy, whilst the art\r\nof therapeutics, although empiricism did not wholly lack recognition,\r\nwas deduced as a logical sequence from theoretical (Galenic and\r\nAristotelian) premises.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Introduction of Arabian Medicine to the West.\r\nArabo-Scholastic Period.]\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at such a condition in the hands of the Mohammedans,\r\nGalenism was now destined to pass once more to the West. From the 11th\r\ncentury onwards Latin translations of this \"Arabian\" Medicine (being\r\nGreek medicine in oriental trappings) began to make their way into\r\nEurope; here they helped to undermine the authority of the one medical\r\nschool of native growth which the West produced during the Middle\r\nAges--namely the School of Salerno.\r\n\r\nBlending with the Scholastic philosophy at the universities of Naples\r\nand Montpellier, the teachings of Aristotle and Galen now assumed a\r\nposition of supreme authority: from their word, in matters scientific\r\nand medical, there was no appeal. In reference to this period the\r\nPergamene was referred to in later times as the \"Medical Pope of the\r\nMiddle Ages.\"\r\n\r\nIt was of course the logical side of Galenism which chiefly commended\r\nit to the mediaeval Schoolmen, as to the essentially speculative\r\nMoslems.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Renascence.]\r\n\r\nThe year 1453, when Constantinople fell into the hands of the Turks,\r\nis often taken as marking the commencement of the Renascence. Among\r\nthe many factors which tended to stimulate and awaken men's minds\r\nduring these spacious times was the rediscovery of the Greek classics,\r\nwhich were brought to Europe by, among others, the scholars who fled\r\nfrom Byzantium. The Arabo-Scholastic versions of Aristotle and Galen\r\nwere now confronted by their Greek originals. A passion for Greek\r\nlearning was aroused. The freshness and truth of these old writings\r\nhelped to awaken men to a renewed sense of their own dignity and\r\nworth, and to brace them in their own struggle for self-expression.\r\n\r\nProminent in this \"Humanist\" movement was the English physician,\r\nThomas Linacre (_c._ 1460-1524) who, having gained in Italy an\r\nextraordinary zeal for the New Learning, devoted the rest of his life,\r\nafter returning to England, to the promotion of the _litterae\r\nhumaniores_, and especially to making Galen accessible to readers of\r\nLatin. Thus the \"_De Naturalibus Facultatibus_\" appeared in London in\r\n1523, and was preceded and followed by several other translations,\r\nall marked by minute accuracy and elegant Latinity.\r\n\r\nTwo new parties now arose in the medical world--the so-called \"Greeks\"\r\nand the more conservative \"Arabists.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Paracelsus.]\r\n\r\nBut the swing of the pendulum did not cease with the creation of the\r\nliberal \"Greek\" party; the dazzling vision of freedom was to drive\r\nsome to a yet more anarchical position. Paracelsus, who flourished in\r\nthe first half of the 16th century, may be taken as typifying this\r\nextremist tendency. His one cry was, \"Let us away with all authority\r\nwhatsoever, and get back to Nature!\" At his first lecture as professor\r\nat the medical school of Basle he symbolically burned the works of\r\nGalen and of his chief Arabian exponent, Avicenna.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Renascence Anatomists.]\r\n\r\nBut the final collapse of authority in medicine could not be brought\r\nabout by mere negativism. It was the constructive work of the\r\nRenascence anatomists, particularly those of the Italian school, which\r\nfinally brought Galenism to the ground.\r\n\r\nVesalius (1514-64), the modern \"Father of Anatomy,\" for dissecting\r\nhuman bodies, was fiercely assailed by the hosts of orthodoxy,\r\nincluding that stout Galenist, his old teacher Jacques Dubois (Jacobus\r\nSylvius). Vesalius held on his way, however, proving, _inter alia_,\r\nthat Galen had been wrong in saying that the interventricular septum\r\nof the heart was permeable (_cf._ present volume, p. 321).\r\n\r\nMichael Servetus (1509-53) suggested that the blood, in order to get\r\nfrom the right to the left side of the heart, might have to pass\r\nthrough the lungs. For his heterodox opinions he was burned at the\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nAnother 16th-century anatomist, Andrea Cesalpino, is considered by the\r\nItalians to have been a discoverer of the circulation of the blood\r\nbefore Harvey; he certainly had a more or less clear idea of the\r\ncirculation, but, as in the case of the \"organic evolutionists before\r\nDarwin,\" he failed to prove his point by conclusive demonstration.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: William Harvey (1578-1657).]\r\n\r\nWilliam Harvey, the great Englishman who founded modern experimental\r\nphysiology and was the first to establish not only the fact of the\r\ncirculation but also the physical laws governing it, is commonly\r\nreckoned the Father of Modern Medicine. He owed his interest in the\r\nmovements of the blood to Fabricio of Acquapendente, his tutor at\r\nPadua, who drew his attention to the valves in the veins, thus\r\nsuggesting the idea of a circular as opposed to a to-and-fro motion.\r\nHarvey's great generalisation, based upon a long series of experiments\r\n_in vivo_, was considered to have given the _coup de grâce_ to the\r\nGalenic physiology, and hence threw temporary discredit upon the whole\r\nsystem of medicine associated therewith.\r\n\r\nModern medicine, based upon a painstaking research into the details\r\nof physiological function, had begun.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Back to Galen!]\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot sufficiently commend the results of the long modern\r\nperiod of research-work to which the labours of the Renascence\r\nanatomists from Vesalius to Harvey form a fitting prelude, we yet by\r\nno means allow that Galen's general medical outlook was so entirely\r\ninvalidated as many imagine by the conclusive demonstration of his\r\nanatomical errors. It is time for us now to turn to Galen again after\r\nthree hundred years of virtual neglect: it may be that he will help us\r\nto see something fundamentally important for medical practice which is\r\nbeyond the power even of our microscopes and _X_-rays to reveal. While\r\nthe value of his work undoubtedly lies mainly in its enabling us to\r\nenvisage one of the greatest of the early steps attained by man in\r\nmedical knowledge, it also has a very definite intrinsic value of its\r\nown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen's Debt to his Precursors.]\r\n\r\nNo attempt can be made here to determine how much of Galen's work is,\r\nin the true sense of the word, original, and how much is drawn from\r\nthe labours of his predecessors. In any case, there is no doubt that\r\nhe was much more than a mere compiler and systematizer of other men's\r\nwork: he was great enough to be able not merely to collect, to digest,\r\nand to assimilate all the best of the work done before his time, but,\r\nadding to this the outcome of his own observations, experiments, and\r\nreflections, to present the whole in an articulated \"system\" showing\r\nthat perfect balance of parts which is the essential criterion of a\r\nwork of art. Constantly, however, in his writings we shall come across\r\ntraces of the influence of, among others, Plato, Aristotle, and\r\nwriters of the Stoic school.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of Hippocrates on Galen.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Galen is an eclectic in the best sense of influence of the\r\nterm, there is one name to which he pays a very special tribute--that\r\nof his illustrious forerunner Hippocrates. Him on quite a number of\r\noccasions he actually calls \"divine\" (_cf._ p. 293).\r\n\r\n\"Hippocrates,\" he says, \"was the first known to us of all who have\r\nbeen both physicians and philosophers, in that _he was the first to\r\nrecognise what nature does_.\" Here is struck the keynote of the\r\nteaching of both Hippocrates and Galen; this is shown in the volume\r\nbefore us, which deals with \"the _natural_ faculties\"--that is with\r\nthe faculties of this same \"Nature\" or vital principle referred to in\r\nthe quotation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The Natural Faculties.\"]\r\n\r\nIf Galen be looked on as a crystallisation of Greek medicine, then\r\nthis book may be looked on as a crystallisation of Galen. Within its\r\ncomparatively short compass we meet with instances illustrating\r\nperhaps most of the sides of this many-sided writer. The \"Natural\r\nFaculties\" therefore forms an excellent prelude to the study of his\r\nlarger and more specialised works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen's \"Physiology.\"]\r\n\r\nWhat, now, is this \"Nature\" or biological principle upon which Galen,\r\nlike Hippocrates, bases the whole of his medical teaching, and which,\r\nwe may add, is constantly overlooked--if indeed ever properly\r\napprehended--by many physiologists of the present day? By using this\r\nterm Galen meant simply that, when we deal with a living thing, we are\r\ndealing primarily with a unity, which, _quâ_ living, is not further\r\ndivisible; all its parts can only be understood and dealt with as\r\nbeing _in relation to_ this principle of unity. Galen was thus led to\r\ncriticise with considerable severity many of the medical and surgical\r\nspecialists of his time, who acted on the assumption (implicit if not\r\nexplicit) that the whole was merely the sum of its parts, and that if,\r\nin an ailing organism, these parts were treated each in and for\r\nitself, the health of the whole organism could in this way be\r\neventually restored.\r\n\r\nGalen expressed this idea of the unity of the organism by saying that\r\nit was governed by a _Physis_ or Nature ([Greek: hê physis hêper\r\ndioikei to zôon]), with whose \"faculties\" or powers it was the\r\nprovince of [Greek: physiologia] (physiology, Nature-lore) to deal.\r\nIt was because Hippocrates had a clear sense of this principle that\r\nGalen called him master. \"Greatest,\" say the Moslems, \"is Allah, and\r\nMohammed is his prophet.\" \"Greatest,\" said Galen, \"is the Physis, and\r\nHippocrates is its prophet.\" Never did Mohammed more zealously\r\nmaintain the unity of the Godhead than Hippocrates and Galen the unity\r\nof the organism.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen's Physics.]\r\n\r\nBut we shall not have read far before we discover that the term\r\n_Physiology_, as used by Galen, stands not merely for what we\r\nunderstand by it nowadays, but also for a large part of _Physics_ as\r\nwell. This is one of the chief sources of confusion in his writings.\r\nHaving grasped, for example, the uniqueness of the process of\r\n_specific selection_ ([Greek: holkê tou oikeiou]), by which the\r\ntissues nourish themselves, he proceeds to apply this principle in\r\nexplanation of entirely different classes of phenomena; thus he mixes\r\nit up with the physical phenomenon of the attraction of the lodestone\r\nfor iron, of dry grain for moisture, etc. It is noteworthy, however,\r\nin these latter instances, that he does not venture to follow out his\r\ncomparison to its logical conclusion; he certainly stops short of\r\nhinting that the lodestone (like a living organ or tissue)\r\n_assimilates_ the metal which it has attracted!\r\n\r\nSetting aside, however, these occasional half-hearted attempts to\r\napply his principle of a [Greek: physis] in regions where it has no\r\nnatural standing, we shall find that in the field of biology Galen\r\nmoves with an assurance bred of first-hand experience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mechanical Physicists.]\r\n\r\nAgainst his attempt to \"biologize\" physics may be set the converse\r\nattempt of the mechanical Atomist school. Thus in Asclepiades he found\r\na doughty defender of the view that physiology was \"merely\" physics.\r\nGalen's ire being roused, he is not content with driving the enemy out\r\nof the biological camp, but must needs attempt also to dislodge him\r\nfrom that of physics, in which he has every right to be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Anatomists.]\r\n\r\nIn defence of the universal validity of his principle, Galen also\r\ntends to excessive disparagement of morphological factors; witness his\r\nobjection to the view of the anatomist Erasistratus that the calibre\r\nof vessels played a part in determining the secretion of fluids (p.\r\n123), that digestion was caused by the mechanical action of the\r\nstomach walls (p. 243), and dropsy by induration of the liver (p.\r\n171).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Characteristics of the Living Organism.]\r\n\r\nWhile combating the atomic explanation of physical processes, Galen of\r\ncourse realised that there were many of these which could only be\r\nexplained according to what we should now call \"mechanical laws.\" For\r\nexample, non-living things could be subjected to [Greek: phora]\r\n(passive motion), they answered to the laws of gravity ([Greek: tais\r\ntôn hylôn oiakizomena rhopais], p. 126). Furthermore, Galen did not\r\nfail to see that living things also were not entirely exempted from\r\nthe operation of these laws; they too may be at least partly subject\r\nto gravity (_loc. cit._); a hollow organ exerts, by virtue of its\r\ncavity, an attraction similar to that of dilating bellows, as well as,\r\nby virtue of the living tissue of its walls, a specifically \"vital\" or\r\nselective kind of attraction (p. 325).\r\n\r\nAs a type of characteristically vital action we may take _nutrition_,\r\nin which occurs a phenomenon which Galen calls _active motion_\r\n([Greek: drastikê kinêsis]) or, more technically, _alteration_\r\n([Greek: alloiôsis]). This active type of motion cannot be adequately\r\nstated in terms of the passive movements (groupings and re-groupings)\r\nof its constituent parts according to certain empirical \"laws.\"\r\nAlteration involves _self-movement_, a self-determination of the\r\norganism or organic part. Galen does not attempt to explain this\r\nfundamental characteristic of _alteration_ any further; he contents\r\nhimself with referring his opponents to Aristotle's work on the\r\n\"Complete Alteration of Substance\" (p. 9).\r\n\r\nThe most important characteristic of the Physis or Nature is its\r\n[Greek: technê]--its artistic creativeness. In other words, the living\r\norganism is a creative artist. This feature may be observed typically\r\nin its primary functions of _growth_ and _nutrition_; these are\r\ndependent on the characteristic _faculties_ or powers, by virtue of\r\nwhich each part draws to itself what is proper or appropriate to it\r\n([Greek: to oikeion]) and rejects what is foreign ([Greek: to\r\nallotrion]), thereafter appropriating or assimilating the attracted\r\nmaterial; this assimilation is an example of the _alteration_ (or\r\nqualitative change) already alluded to; thus the food eaten is\r\n\"altered\" into the various tissues of the body, each of these having\r\nbeen provided by \"Nature\" with its own specific faculties of\r\nattraction and repulsion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Three Categories.]\r\n\r\nAny of the operations of the living part may be looked on in three\r\nways, either (_a_) as a [Greek: dynamis], faculty, potentiality;\r\n(_b_) as an [Greek: energeia], which is this [Greek: dynamis] in\r\noperation; or (_c_) as an [Greek: ergon], the product or effect of the\r\n[Greek: energeia].[3]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen's Method.]\r\n\r\nLike his master Hippocrates, Galen attached fundamental importance to\r\nclinical observation--to the evidence of the senses as the\r\nindispensable groundwork of all medical knowledge. He had also,\r\nhowever, a forte for rapid generalisation from observations, and his\r\nlogical proclivities disposed him particularly to deductive\r\nreasoning. Examples of an almost Euclidean method of argument may be\r\nfound in the _Natural Faculties_ (_e.g._ Book III. chap. i.). While\r\nthis method undoubtedly gave him much help in his search for truth, it\r\nalso not unfrequently led him astray. This is evidenced by his\r\nattempt, already noted, to apply the biological principle of the\r\n[Greek: physis] in physics. Characteristic examples of attempts to\r\nforce facts to fit premises will be found in Book II. chap. ix., where\r\nour author demonstrates that yellow bile is \"virtually\" dry, and also,\r\nby a process of exclusion, assigns to the spleen the function of\r\nclearing away black bile. Strangest of all is his attempt to prove\r\nthat the same principle of specific attraction by which the ultimate\r\ntissues nourish themselves (and the lodestone attracts iron!) accounts\r\nfor the reception of food into the stomach, of urine into the kidneys,\r\nof bile into the gall-bladder, and of semen into the uterus.\r\n\r\nThese instances are given, however, without prejudice to the system of\r\ngeneralisation and deduction which, in Galen's hands, often proved\r\nexceedingly fruitful. He is said to have tried \"to unite professional\r\nand scientific medicine with a philosophic link.\" He objected,\r\nhowever, to such extreme attempts at simplification of medical science\r\nas that of the Methodists, to whom diseases were isolated entities,\r\nwithout any relationships in time or space (_v._ p. xv. _supra_).\r\n\r\nHe based much of his pathological reasoning upon the \"humoral theory\"\r\nof Hippocrates, according to which certain diseases were caused by one\r\nor more of the four humours (blood, phlegm, black and yellow bile)\r\nbeing in excess--that is, by various _dyscrasiae_. Our modern\r\nconception of \"hormone\" action shows certain resemblances with this\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nBesides observation and reasoning, Galen took his stand on\r\n_experiment_; he was one of the first of experimental physiologists,\r\nas is illustrated in the present book by his researches into the\r\nfunction of the kidneys (p. 59 _et seq._). He also conducted a long\r\nseries of experiments into the physiology of the spinal cord, to\r\ndetermine what parts controlled movement and what sensibility.\r\n\r\nAs a practitioner he modelled his work largely on the broad and simple\r\nlines laid down by Hippocrates. He had also at his disposal all the\r\nacquisitions of biological science dating from the time of Aristotle\r\nfive hundred years earlier, and reinforced by the discoveries in\r\nanatomy made by the Alexandrian school. To these he added a large\r\nseries of researches of his own.\r\n\r\nGalen never confined himself to what one might call the academic or\r\nstrictly orthodox sources of information; he roamed the world over for\r\nanswers to his queries. For example, we find him on his journeys\r\nbetween Pergamos and Rome twice visiting the island of Lemnos in order\r\nto procure some of the _terra sigillata_, a kind of earth which had a\r\nreputation for healing the bites of serpents and other wounds. At\r\nother times he visited the copper-mines of Cyprus in search for\r\ncopper, and Palestine for the resin called Balm of Gilead.\r\n\r\nBy inclination and training Galen was the reverse of a \"party-man.\" In\r\nthe _Natural Faculties_ (p. 55) he speaks of the bane of sectarian\r\npartizanship, \"harder to heal than any itch.\" He pours scorn upon the\r\nignorant \"Erasistrateans\" and \"Asclepiadeans,\" who attempted to hide\r\ntheir own incompetence under the shield of some great man's name\r\n(_cf._ p. 141).\r\n\r\nOf the two chief objects of his censure in the _Natural Faculties_,\r\nGalen deals perhaps less rigorously with Erasistratus than with\r\nAsclepiades. Erasistratus did at least recognize the existence of a\r\nvital principle in the organism, albeit, with his eye on the\r\nstructures which the scalpel displayed he tended frequently to forget\r\nit. The researches of the anatomical school of Alexandria had been\r\nnaturally of the greatest service to surgery, but in medicine they\r\nsometimes had a tendency to check progress by diverting attention from\r\nthe whole to the part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Pneuma or Spirit.]\r\n\r\nAnother novel conception frequently occurring in Galen's writings is\r\nthat of the _Pneuma_ (_i.e._ the breath, _spiritus_). This word is\r\nused in two senses, as meaning (1) the inspired air, which was drawn\r\ninto the left side of the heart and thence carried all over the body\r\nby the arteries; this has not a few analogies with oxygen,\r\nparticularly as its action in the tissues is attended with the\r\nappearance of the so-called \"innate heat.\" (2) A vital principle,\r\nconceived as being made up of matter in the most subtle imaginable\r\nstate (_i.e._ air). This vital principle became resolved into three\r\nkinds: (_a_) [Greek: pneuma physikon] or _spiritus naturalis_, carried\r\nby the veins, and presiding over the subconscious vegetative life;\r\nthis \"natural spirit\" is therefore practically equivalent to the\r\n[Greek: physis] or \"nature\" itself. (_b_) The [Greek: pneuma zôtikon]\r\nor _spiritus vitalis_; here particularly is a source of error, since\r\nthe air already alluded to as being carried by the arteries tends to\r\nbe confused with this principle of \"individuality\" or relative\r\nautonomy in the circulatory (including, perhaps, the vasomotor)\r\nsystem. (_c_) The [Greek: pneuma psychikon] or _spiritus animalis_\r\n(anima = [Greek: psychê]), carried by longitudinal canals in the nerves;\r\nthis corresponds to the [Greek: psychê].\r\n\r\nThis view of a \"vital principle\" as necessarily consisting of matter\r\nin a finely divided, fluid, or \"etheric\" state is not unknown even in\r\nour day. Belief in the fundamental importance of the Pneuma formed the\r\nbasis of the teaching of another vitalist school in ancient Greece,\r\nthat of the Pneumatists.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen and the Circulation of the Blood.]\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to detail here the various ways in which Galen's\r\nphysiological views differ from those of the Moderns, as most of these\r\nare noticed in footnotes to the text of the present translation. His\r\nignorance of the circulation of the blood does not lessen the force of\r\nhis general physiological conclusions to the extent that might be\r\nanticipated. In his opinion, the great bulk of the blood travelled\r\nwith a to-and-fro motion in the veins, while a little of it, mixed\r\nwith inspired air, moved in the same way along the arteries; whereas\r\nwe now know that all the blood goes outward by the arteries and\r\nreturns by the veins; in either case blood is carried to the tissues\r\nby blood-vessels, and Galen's ideas of tissue-nutrition were\r\nwonderfully sound. The ingenious method by which (in ignorance of the\r\npulmonary circulation) he makes blood pass from the right to the left\r\nventricle, may be read in the present work (p. 321). As will be seen,\r\nhe was conversant with the \"anastomoses\" between the ultimate branches\r\nof arteries and veins, although he imagined that they were not used\r\nunder \"normal\" conditions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen's Character.]\r\n\r\nGalen was not only a man of great intellectual gifts, but one also of\r\nstrong moral fibre. In his short treatise \"That the best Physician is\r\nalso a Philosopher\" he outlines his professional ideals. It is\r\nnecessary for the efficient healer to be versed in the three branches\r\nof \"philosophy,\" viz.: (_a_) _logic_, the science of how to think;\r\n(_b_) _physics_, the science of what is--_i.e._ of \"Nature\" in the\r\nwidest sense; (_c_) _ethics_, the science of what to do. The amount of\r\ntoil which he who wishes to be a physician must undergo--firstly, in\r\nmastering the work of his predecessors and afterwards in studying\r\ndisease at first hand--makes it absolutely necessary that he should\r\npossess perfect self-control, that he should scorn money and the weak\r\npleasures of the senses, and should live laborious days.\r\n\r\nReaders of the following pages will notice that Galen uses what we\r\nshould call distinctly immoderate language towards those who ventured\r\nto differ from the views of his master Hippocrates (which were also\r\nhis own). The employment of such language was one of the few\r\nweaknesses of his age which he did not transcend. Possibly also his\r\nmother's choleric temper may have predisposed him to it.\r\n\r\nThe fact, too, that his vivisection experiments (_e.g._ pp. 59, 273)\r\nwere carried out apparently without any kind of anaesthetisation being\r\neven thought of is abhorrent to the feelings of to-day, but must be\r\nexcused also on the ground that callousness towards animals was then\r\ncustomary, men having probably never thought much about the subject.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Galen's Greek Style.]\r\n\r\nGalen is a master of language, using a highly polished variety of\r\nAttic prose with a precision which can be only very imperfectly\r\nreproduced in another tongue. Every word he uses has an exact and\r\ndefinite meaning attached to it. Translation is particularly difficult\r\nwhen a word stands for a physiological conception which is not now\r\nheld; instances are the words _anadosis_, _prosthesis_, and\r\n_prosphysis_, indicating certain steps in the process by which\r\nnutriment is conveyed from the alimentary canal to the tissues.\r\n\r\nReaders will be surprised to find how many words are used by Galen\r\nwhich they would have thought had been expressly coined to fit modern\r\nconceptions; thus our author employs not merely such terms as\r\n_physiology_, _phthisis_, _atrophy_, _anastomosis_, but also\r\n_haematopoietic_, _anaesthesia_, and even _aseptic_! It is only fair,\r\nhowever, to remark that these terms, particularly the last, were not\r\nused by Galen in quite their modern significance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary.]\r\n\r\nTo resume, then: What contribution can Galen bring to the art of\r\nhealing at the present day? It was not, surely, for nothing that the\r\ngreat Pergamene gave laws to the medical world for over a thousand\r\nyears!\r\n\r\nLet us draw attention once more to:\r\n\r\n(1) The high ideal which he set before the profession.\r\n\r\n(2) His insistence on immediate contact with nature as the primary\r\ncondition for arriving at an understanding of disease; on the need for\r\ndue consideration of previous authorities; on the need also for\r\nreflection--for employment of the mind's eye ([Greek: hê logikê\r\ntheôria]) as an aid to the physical eye.\r\n\r\n(3) His essentially broad outlook, which often helped him in the\r\ncomprehension of a phenomenon through his knowledge of an analogous\r\nphenomenon in another field of nature.\r\n\r\n(4) His keen appreciation of the unity of the organism, and of the\r\ninter-dependence of its parts; his realisation that the vital\r\nphenomena (physiological and pathological) in a living organism can\r\nonly be understood when considered in relation to the _environment_ of\r\nthat organism or part. This is the foundation for the war that Galen\r\nwaged _à outrance_ on the Methodists, to whom diseases were things\r\nwithout relation to anything. This dispute is, unfortunately, not\r\ntouched upon in the present volume. What Galen combated was the\r\ntendency, familiar enough in our own day, to reduce medicine to the\r\nscience of finding a label for each patient, and then treating not the\r\npatient, but the label. (This tendency, we may remark in parenthesis,\r\nis one which is obviously well suited for the _standardising_ purposes\r\nof a State medical service, and is therefore one which all who have\r\nthe weal of the profession at heart must most jealously watch in the\r\ndifficult days that lie ahead.)\r\n\r\n(5) His realisation of the inappropriateness and inadequacy of\r\nphysical formulae in explaining physiological activities. Galen's\r\ndisputes with Asclepiades over [Greek: ta prôta ekeina sômata ta\r\napathê], over the [Greek: anarma stoicheia kai lêrôdeis onkoi], is but\r\nanother aspect of his quarrel with the Methodists regarding their\r\npathological \"units,\" whose primary characteristic was just this same\r\n[Greek: apatheia] (impassiveness to environment, \"unimpressionability\").\r\nWe have of course our Physiatric or Iatromechanical school at the\r\npresent day, to whom such processes as absorption from the alimentary\r\ncanal, the respiratory interchange of gases, and the action of the renal\r\nepithelium are susceptible of a purely physical explanation.[4]\r\n\r\n(6) His quarrel with the Anatomists, which was in essence the same as\r\nthat with the Atomists, and which arose from his clear realisation\r\nthat that primary and indispensable desideratum, a view of the whole,\r\ncould never be obtained by a mere summation of partial views; hence,\r\nalso, his sense of the dangers which would beset the medical art if it\r\nwere allowed to fall into the hands of a mere crowd of competing\r\nspecialists without any organising head to guide them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [1] _On the Affections of the Mind_, p. 41 (Kühn's ed.).\r\n\r\n    [2] \"Averrhoës who made the great Commentary\" (Dante). It\r\n    was Averrhoës (Ebn Roshd) who, in the 12th century,\r\n    introduced Aristotle to the Mohammedan world, and the\r\n    \"Commentary\" referred to was on Aristotle.\r\n\r\n    [3] What appear to me to be certain resemblances between\r\n    the Galenical and the modern vitalistic views of Henri\r\n    Bergson may perhaps be alluded to here. Galen's vital\r\n    principle, [Greek: hê technikê physis] (\"creative\r\n    growth\"), presents analogies with _l'Evolution créatrice_:\r\n    both manifest their activity in producing qualitative\r\n    change ([Greek: alloiôsis], _changement_): in both, the\r\n    creative change cannot be analysed into a series of static\r\n    states, but is one and continuous. In Galen, however, it\r\n    comes to an end with the _development of the individual_,\r\n    whereas in Bergson it continues indefinitely as the\r\n    _evolution of life_. The three aspects of organic life may\r\n    be tabulated thus:--\r\n\r\n    [Greek: dynamis]  [Greek: energeia]         [Greek: ergon]\r\n\r\n    Work to be done.  Work being done.           Work done, finished.\r\n    Future aspect.      Present aspect.            Past aspect.\r\n                        Function.                  Structure.\r\n                        The _élan vital_.          A \"thing.\"\r\n                        A changing which\r\n                          cannot be understood\r\n                          as a sum of static\r\n                          parts; a constant\r\n                          becoming, never\r\n                          stopping--at least\r\n                          till the [Greek: ergon]\r\n                          is reached.\r\n\r\n    Bergson's         Bergson's                  Bergson's \"outlook\r\n     \"teleological\"     \"philosophical\"            of physical\r\n      aspect.            aspect.                   science.\"\r\n\r\n    Galen recognized \"creativeness\" ([Greek: technê]) in the\r\n    _development_ of the individual and its parts (ontogeny)\r\n    and in the maintenance of these, but he failed to\r\n    appreciate the creative _evolution_ of species\r\n    (phylogeny), which is, of course, part of the same\r\n    process. To the teleologist the possibilities ([Greek:\r\n    dynameis]) of the Physis are limited, to Bergson they\r\n    are unlimited. Galen and Bergson agree in attaching most\r\n    practical importance to the middle category--that of\r\n    Function.\r\n\r\n    While it must be conceded that Galen, following\r\n    Aristotle, had never seriously questioned the fixity of\r\n    species, the following quotation from his work _On\r\n    Habits_ (chap. ii.) will show that he must have at least\r\n    had occasional glimmerings of our modern point of view\r\n    on the matter. Referring to _assimilation_, he says:\r\n    \"Just as everything we eat or drink becomes _altered in\r\n    quality_, so of course also does the altering factor\r\n    itself become altered.... A clear proof of the\r\n    assimilation of things which are being nourished to that\r\n    which is nourishing them is the change which occurs in\r\n    plants and seeds; this often goes so far that what is\r\n    highly noxious in one soil becomes, when transplanted\r\n    into another soil, not merely harmless, but actually\r\n    useful. This has been largely put to the test by those\r\n    who compose memoirs on farming and on plants, as also by\r\n    zoological authors who have written on the changes which\r\n    occur according to the countries in which animals live.\r\n    Since, therefore, not only is the nourishment altered by\r\n    the creature nourished, but the latter itself also\r\n    undergoes some slight alteration, _this slight\r\n    alteration must necessarily become considerable in the\r\n    course of time_, and thus properties resulting from\r\n    prolonged habit must come to be on a par with natural\r\n    properties.\"\r\n\r\n    Galen fails to see the possibility that the \"natural\"\r\n    properties themselves originated in this way, as\r\n    activities which gradually became habitual--that is to\r\n    say, that the effects of _nurture_ may become a \"second\r\n    nature,\" and so eventually _nature_ itself.\r\n\r\n    The whole passage, however, may be commended to modern\r\n    biologists--particularly, might one say, to those\r\n    bacteriologists who have not yet realised how\r\n    extraordinarily _relative_ is the term \"specificity\"\r\n    when applied to the subject-matter of their science.\r\n\r\n    [4] In terms of filtration, diffusion, and osmosis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nCodices\r\n\r\nBibliothèque Nationale.

The\r\n  author proposes to confine himself to a consideration of\r\n  the latter--the vegetative--aspect of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter II\r\n\r\n  Definition of terms. Different kinds of _motion_.\r\n  _Alteration_ or qualitative change. Refutation of the\r\n  Sophists' objection that such change is only apparent,\r\n  not real. The four fundamental qualities of Hippocrates\r\n  (later Aristotle). Distinction between _faculty_,\r\n  _activity_ (function), and _effect_ (work or product).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter III\r\n\r\n  It is by virtue of the _four qualities_ that each part\r\n  functions. Some authorities subordinate the dry and the\r\n  moist principles to the hot and the cold. Aristotle\r\n  inconsistent here.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter IV\r\n\r\n  We must suppose that there are _faculties_ corresponding\r\n  in number to the visible _effects_ (or products) with\r\n  which we are familiar.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter V\r\n\r\n  Genesis, growth, and nutrition. Genesis (embryogeny)\r\n  sub-divided into histogenesis and organogenesis. Growth\r\n  is a tridimensional expansion of the solid parts formed\r\n  during genesis. Nutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter VI\r\n\r\n  The process of genesis (embryogeny) from insemination\r\n  onwards. Each of the simple, elementary, homogeneous\r\n  parts (tissues) is produced by a special blend of the\r\n  four primary alterative faculties (such secondary\r\n  alterative faculties being _ostopoietic_,\r\n  _neuropoietic_, etc.). A special _function_ and _use_\r\n  also corresponds to each of these special tissues. The\r\n  bringing of these tissues together into _organs_ and the\r\n  disposal of these organs is performed by another faculty\r\n  called _diaplastic_, _moulding_, or _formative_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter VII\r\n\r\n  We now pass from genesis to _growth_. Growth essentially\r\n  a post-natal process; it involves two factors, expansion\r\n  and nutrition, explained by analogy of a familiar\r\n  child's game.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter VIII\r\n\r\n  Nutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter IX\r\n\r\n  These three primary faculties (genesis, growth,\r\n  nutrition) have various others subservient to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter X\r\n\r\n  Nutrition not a simple process. (1) Need of subsidiary\r\n  organs for the various stages of alteration, _e.g._, of\r\n  bread into blood, of that into bone, etc. (2) Need also\r\n  of organs for excreting the non-utilizable portions of\r\n  the food, _e.g._, much vegetable matter is superfluous.\r\n  (3) Need of organs of a third kind, for distributing the\r\n  pabulum through the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XI\r\n\r\n  Nutrition analysed into the stages of application\r\n  (_prosthesis_), adhesion (_prosphysis_), and\r\n  assimilation. The stages illustrated by certain\r\n  pathological conditions. Different shades of meaning of\r\n  the term _nutriment_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XII\r\n\r\n  The two chief medico-philosophical schools--Atomist and\r\n  Vitalist. Hippocrates an adherent of the latter\r\n  school--his doctrine of an original principle or\r\n  \"nature\" in every living thing (doctrine of the unity of\r\n  the organism).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XIII\r\n\r\n  Failure of Asclepiades to understand the functions of\r\n  kidneys and ureters. His hypothesis of vaporization of\r\n  imbibed fluids is here refuted. A demonstration of\r\n  urinary secretion in the living animal; the forethought\r\n  and artistic skill of Nature vindicated. Refutation also\r\n  of Asclepiades's disbelief in the special selective\r\n  action of purgative drugs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XIV\r\n\r\n  While Asclepiades denies _in toto_ the obvious fact of\r\n  specific attraction, Epicurus grants the fact, although\r\n  his attempt to explain it by the atomic hypothesis\r\n  breaks down. Refutation of the Epicurean theory of\r\n  magnetic attraction. Instances of specific attraction of\r\n  thorns and animal poisons by medicaments, of moisture by\r\n  corn, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XV\r\n\r\n  It now being granted that the urine is secreted by the\r\n  kidneys, the _rationale_ of this secretion is enquired\r\n  into. The kidneys are not mechanical filters, but are by\r\n  virtue of their _nature_ possessed of a specific faculty\r\n  of attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XVI\r\n\r\n  Erasistratus, again, by his favourite principle of\r\n  _horror vacui_ could never explain the secretion of\r\n  urine by the kidneys. While, however, he acknowledged\r\n  that the kidneys do secrete urine, he makes no attempt\r\n  to explain this; he ignores, but does not attempt to\r\n  refute, the Hippocratic doctrine of specific\r\n  _attraction_. \"Servile\" position taken up by Asclepiades\r\n  and Erasistratus in regard to this function of urinary\r\n  secretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XVII\r\n\r\n  Three other attempts (by adherents of the Erasistratean\r\n  school and by Lycus of Macedonia) to explain how the\r\n  kidneys come to separate out urine from the blood. All\r\n  these ignore the obvious principle of attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter I\r\n\r\n  In order to explain dispersal of food from alimentary\r\n  canal _viâ_ the veins (_anadosis_) there is no need to\r\n  invoke with Erasistratus, the _horror vacui_, since here\r\n  again the principle of specific attraction is operative;\r\n  moreover, blood is also driven forward by the\r\n  compressing action of the stomach and the contractions\r\n  of the veins. Possibility, however, of Erasistratus's\r\n  factor playing a certain minor _rôle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter II\r\n\r\n  The Erasistratean idea that bile becomes separated out\r\n  from the blood in the liver because, being the thinner\r\n  fluid, it alone can enter the narrow stomata of the\r\n  bile-ducts, while the thicker blood can only enter the\r\n  wider mouths of the hepatic venules.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter III\r\n\r\n  The morphological factors suggested by Erasistratus are\r\n  quite inadequate to explain biological happenings.\r\n  Erasistratus inconsistent with his own statements. The\r\n  immanence of the _physis_ or nature; her shaping is not\r\n  merely external like that of a statuary, but involves\r\n  the entire substance. In genesis (embryogeny) the semen\r\n  is the active, and the menstrual blood the passive,\r\n  principle. Attractive, alterative, and formative\r\n  faculties of the semen. Embryogeny is naturally followed\r\n  by growth; these two functions distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter IV\r\n\r\n  Unjustified claim by Erasistrateans that their founder\r\n  had associations with the Peripatetic (Aristotelian)\r\n  school. The characteristic physiological tenets of that\r\n  school (which were all anticipated by Hippocrates) in no\r\n  way agree with those of Erasistratus, save that both\r\n  recognize the purposefulness of Nature; in practice,\r\n  however, Erasistratus assumed numerous exceptions to\r\n  this principle. Difficulty of understanding why he\r\n  rejected the biological principle of attraction in\r\n  favour of anatomical factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter V\r\n\r\n  A further difficulty raised by Erasistratus's statement\r\n  regarding secretion of bile in the liver.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter VI\r\n\r\n  The same holds with nutrition. Even if we grant that\r\n  veins may obtain their nutrient blood by virtue of the\r\n  _horror vacui_ (chap. i.), how could this explain the\r\n  nutrition of nerves? Erasistratus's hypothesis of minute\r\n  elemental nerves and vessels within the ordinary visible\r\n  nerves simply throws the difficulty further back. And is\r\n  Erasistratus's minute \"simple\" nerve susceptible of\r\n  further analysis, as the Atomists would assume? If so,\r\n  this is opposed to the conception of a constructive and\r\n  artistic Nature which Erasistratus himself shares with\r\n  Hippocrates and the writer. And if his minute nerve is\r\n  really elementary and not further divisible, then it\r\n  cannot, according to his own showing, contain a cavity;\r\n  therefore the _horror vacui_ does not apply to it. And\r\n  how could this principle apply to the restoration to its\r\n  original bulk of a part which had become thin through\r\n  disease, where more matter must become attached than\r\n  runs away? A quotation from Erasistratus shows that he\r\n  did acknowledge an \"attraction,\" although not exactly in\r\n  the Hippocratic sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter VII\r\n\r\n  In the last resort, the ultimate living elements\r\n  (Erasistratus's _simple vessels_) must draw in their\r\n  food by virtue of an inherent attractive faculty like\r\n  that which the lodestone exerts on iron. Thus the\r\n  process of anadosis, from beginning to end, can be\r\n  explained without assuming a _horror vacui_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter VIII\r\n\r\n  Erasistratus's disregard for the humours. In respect to\r\n  excessive formation of bile, however, prevention is\r\n  better than cure: accordingly we must consider its\r\n  pathology. Does blood pre-exist in the food, or does it\r\n  come into existence in the body? Erasistratus's purely\r\n  anatomical explanation of _dropsy_. He entirely avoids\r\n  the question of the four qualities (_e.g._ the\r\n  importance of innate heat) in the generation of the\r\n  humours, etc. Yet the problem of blood-production is no\r\n  less important than that of gastric digestion. Proof\r\n  that bile does not pre-exist in the food. The four\r\n  fundamental qualities of Hippocrates and Aristotle. How\r\n  the humours are formed from food taken into the veins:\r\n  when heat is in proportionate amount, blood results;\r\n  when in excess, bile; when deficient, phlegm. Various\r\n  conditions determining cold or warm temperaments. The\r\n  four primary diseases result each from excess of one of\r\n  the four qualities. Erasistratus unwillingly\r\n  acknowledges this when he ascribes the indigestion\r\n  occurring in fever to _impaired function_ of the\r\n  stomach. For what causes this _functio laesa_? Proof\r\n  that it is the fever (excess of innate heat).\r\n\r\n  If, then, heat plays so important a part in abnormal\r\n  functioning, so must it also in normal (_i.e._ causes of\r\n  eucrasia involved in those of dyscrasia, of physiology\r\n  in those of pathology). A like argument explains the\r\n  _genesis of the humours_. Addition of warmth to things\r\n  already warm makes them bitter; thus honey turns to bile\r\n  in people who are already warm; where warmth deficient,\r\n  as in old people, it turns to useful blood. This is a\r\n  proof that bile does not pre-exist, as such, in the\r\n  food.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter IX\r\n\r\n  The _functions of organs_ also depend on the way in\r\n  which the four qualities are mixed--_e.g._ the\r\n  contracting function of the stomach. Treatment only\r\n  possible when we know the _causes_ of errors of\r\n  function. The Erasistrateans practically Empiricists in\r\n  this respect. On an appreciation of the meaning of a\r\n  _dyscrasia_ follows naturally the Hippocratic principle\r\n  of treating opposites by opposites (_e.g._ cooling the\r\n  over-heated stomach, warming it when chilled, etc.).\r\n  Useless in treatment to know merely the function of each\r\n  organ; we must know the _bodily condition_ which upsets\r\n  this function. Blood is warm and moist. Yellow bile is\r\n  warm and (virtually, though not apparently) dry. Phlegm\r\n  is cold and moist. The fourth possible combination (cold\r\n  and dry) is represented by _black bile_. For the\r\n  clearing out of this humour from the blood, Nature has\r\n  provided the spleen--an organ which, according to\r\n  Erasistratus, fulfils no purpose. Proof of the\r\n  importance of the spleen is the jaundice, toxaemia,\r\n  etc., occurring when it is diseased. Erasistratus's\r\n  failure to mention the views of leading authorities on\r\n  this organ shows the hopelessness of his position. The\r\n  Hippocratic view has now been demonstrated deductively\r\n  and inductively. The classical view as to the generation\r\n  of the humours. Normal and pathological forms of yellow\r\n  and black bile. Part played by the _innate heat_ in\r\n  their production. Other kinds of bile are merely\r\n  transition-stages between these extreme types. Abnormal\r\n  forms removed by liver and spleen respectively. Phlegm,\r\n  however, does not need a special excretory organ, as it\r\n  can undergo entire metabolism in the body.\r\n\r\n  Need for studying the works of the Ancients carefully,\r\n  in order to reach a proper understanding of this\r\n  subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter I\r\n\r\n  A recapitulation of certain points previously\r\n  demonstrated. Every part of the animal has an attractive\r\n  and an alterative (assimilative) faculty; it attracts\r\n  the nutrient juice which is proper to it. Assimilation\r\n  is preceded by adhesion (_prosphysis_) and that again,\r\n  by application (_prosthesis_). Application the goal of\r\n  attraction. It would not, however, be followed by\r\n  adhesion and assimilation if each part did not also\r\n  possess a faculty for _retaining in position_ the\r\n  nutriment which has been applied. _A priori_ necessity\r\n  for this _retentive_ faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter II\r\n\r\n  The same faculty to be proved _a posteriori_. Its\r\n  corresponding _function_ (_i.e._ the activation of this\r\n  faculty or potentiality) well seen in the large hollow\r\n  organs, notably the uterus and stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter III\r\n\r\n  Exercise of the retentive faculty particularly well seen\r\n  in the uterus. Its object is to allow the embryo to\r\n  attain full development; this being completed, a new\r\n  faculty--the expulsive--hitherto quiescent, comes into\r\n  play. Characteristic signs and symptoms of pregnancy.\r\n  Tight grip of uterus on growing embryo, and accurate\r\n  closure of os uteri during operation of the retentive\r\n  faculty. Dilatation of os and expulsive activities of\r\n  uterus at full term, or when foetus dies. Prolapse from\r\n  undue exercise of this faculty. _Rôle_ of the midwife.\r\n  Accessory muscles in parturition.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter IV\r\n\r\n  Same two faculties seen in stomach. _Gurglings_ or\r\n  _borborygmi_ show that this organ is weak and is not\r\n  gripping its contents tightly enough. Undue delay of\r\n  food in a weak stomach proved not to be due to\r\n  narrowness of pylorus: length of stay depends on whether\r\n  _digestion_ (another instance of the characteristically\r\n  vital process of _alteration_) has taken place or not.\r\n  Erasistratus wrong in attributing digestion merely to\r\n  the mechanical action of the stomach walls. When\r\n  digestion completed, then pylorus opens and allows\r\n  contents to pass downwards, just as os uteri when\r\n  development of embyro completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter V\r\n\r\n  If attraction and elimination always proceeded _pari\r\n  passu_, the content of these hollow organs (including\r\n  gall-bladder and urinary bladder) would never vary in\r\n  amount. A _retentive_ faculty, therefore, also logically\r\n  needed. Its existence demonstrated. Expulsion determined\r\n  by qualitative and quantitative changes of contents.\r\n  \"Diarrhoea\" of stomach. Vomiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter VI\r\n\r\n  Every organic part has an _appetite_ and _aversion_ for\r\n  the qualities which are appropriate and foreign to it\r\n  respectively. Attraction necessarily leads to a certain\r\n  _benefit_ received. This again necessitates _retention_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter VII\r\n\r\n  Interaction between two bodies; the stronger masters the\r\n  weaker; a deleterious drug masters the forces of the\r\n  body, whereas food is mastered by them; this mastery is\r\n  an _alteration_, and the amount of alteration varies\r\n  with the different organs; thus a partial alteration is\r\n  effected in mouth by saliva, but much greater in\r\n  stomach, where not only gastric juice, but also bile,\r\n  pneuma, innate heat (_i.e._ oxidation?), and other\r\n  powerful factors are brought to bear on it; need of\r\n  considerable alteration in stomach as a\r\n  transition-stage between food and blood; appearance of\r\n  faeces in intestine another proof of great alteration\r\n  effected in stomach. Asclepiades's denial of real\r\n  qualitative change in stomach rebutted. Erasistratus's\r\n  denial that digestion in any way resembles a _boiling_\r\n  process comes from his taking words too literally.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter VIII\r\n\r\n  Erasistratus denies that the stomach exerts any pull in\r\n  the act of swallowing. That he is wrong, however, is\r\n  proved by the anatomical structure of the stomach--its\r\n  inner coat with longitudinal fibres obviously acts as a\r\n  _vis a fronte_ (attraction), whilst its outer coat\r\n  exercises through the contraction of its circular fibres\r\n  a _vis a tergo_ (propulsion); the latter also comes into\r\n  play in vomiting. The stomach uses the oesophagus as a\r\n  kind of hand, to draw in its food with. The functions of\r\n  the two coats proved also by vivisection. Swallowing\r\n  cannot be attributed merely to the force of gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter IX\r\n\r\n  These four faculties which subserve nutrition are thus\r\n  apparent in many different parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter X\r\n\r\n  Need for elaborating the statements of the ancient\r\n  physicians. Superiority of Ancients to Moderns. This\r\n  state of affairs can only be rectified by a really\r\n  efficient education of youth. The chief requisites of\r\n  such an education.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XI\r\n\r\n  For the sake of the few who realty wish truth, the\r\n  argument will be continued. A third kind of fibre--the\r\n  _oblique_--subserves _retention_; the way in which this\r\n  fibre is disposed in different coats.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XII\r\n\r\n  The factor which brings the expulsive faculty into\r\n  action is essentially a condition of the organ or its\r\n  contents which is the reverse of that which determined\r\n  attraction. Analogy between abortion and normal\r\n  parturition. Whatever produces _discomfort_ must be\r\n  expelled. That discomfort also determines expulsion of\r\n  contents from gall-bladder is not so evident as in the\r\n  case of stomach, uterus, urinary bladder, etc., but can\r\n  be logically demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XIII\r\n\r\n  Expulsion takes place through the same channel as\r\n  attraction (_e.g._, in stomach, gall-bladder, uterus).\r\n  Similarly the delivery (_anadosis_) of nutriment to the\r\n  liver from the food-canal _viâ_ the mesenteric veins may\r\n  have its direction reversed. Continuous give-and-take\r\n  between different parts of the body; superior strength\r\n  of certain parts is natural, of others acquired. When\r\n  liver contains abundant food and stomach depleted,\r\n  latter may draw on former; this occurs when animal can\r\n  get nothing to eat, and so prevents starvation.\r\n  Similarly, when one part becomes over-distended, it\r\n  tends to deposit its excess in some weaker part near it;\r\n  this passes it on to some still weaker part, which\r\n  cannot get rid of it; hence _deposits_ of various kinds.\r\n  Further instances of reversal of the normal direction of\r\n  anadosis from the food canal through the veins. Such\r\n  reversal of functions would in any case be expected _a\r\n  priori_. In the vomiting of intestinal obstruction,\r\n  matter may be carried backwards all the way from the\r\n  intestine to the mouth; not surprising, therefore, that,\r\n  under certain circumstances, food-material might be\r\n  driven right back from the skin-surface to the\r\n  alimentary canal (_e.g._ in excessive chilling of\r\n  surface); not much needed to determine this reversal of\r\n  direction. Action of purgative drugs upon terminals of\r\n  veins; one part draws from another until whole body\r\n  participates; similarly in intestinal obstruction, each\r\n  part passes on the irritating substance to its weaker\r\n  neighbour. Reversal of direction of flow occurs not\r\n  merely on occasion but also constantly (as in arteries,\r\n  lungs, heart, etc.). The various stages of normal\r\n  nutrition described. Why the stomach sometimes draws\r\n  back the nutriment it had passed on to portal veins and\r\n  liver. A similar ebb and flow in relation to the spleen.\r\n  Comparison of the parts of the body to a lot of animals\r\n  at a feast. The valves of the heart are a provision of\r\n  Nature to prevent this otherwise inevitable\r\n  regurgitation, though even they are not quite efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XIV\r\n\r\n  The superficial arteries, when they dilate, draw in air\r\n  from the atmosphere, and the deeper ones a fine,\r\n  vaporous blood from the veins and heart. Lighter matter\r\n  such as air will always be drawn in preference to\r\n  heavier; this is why the arteries in the food-canal draw\r\n  in practically none of the nutrient matter contained in\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chapter XV\r\n\r\n  The two kinds of attraction--the mechanical attraction\r\n  of dilating bellows and the \"physical\" (vital)\r\n  attraction by living tissue of nutrient matter which is\r\n  specifically allied or appropriate to it. The former\r\n  kind--that resulting from _horror vacui_--acts primarily\r\n  on light matter, whereas vital attraction has no\r\n  essential concern with such mechanical factors. A hollow\r\n  organ exercises, by virtue of its cavity, the former\r\n  kind of attraction, and by virtue of the living tissue\r\n  of its walls, the second kind. Application of this to\r\n  question of contents of arteries; _anastomoses of\r\n  arteries and veins_. _Foramina in interventricular\r\n  septum of heart_, allowing some blood to pass from right\r\n  to left ventricle. Large size of aorta probably due to\r\n  fact that it not merely carries the pneuma received from\r\n  the lungs, but also some of the blood which percolates\r\n  through septum from right ventricle. Thus arteries carry\r\n  not merely pneuma, but also some light vaporous blood,\r\n  which certain parts need more than the ordinary thick\r\n  blood of the veins. The organic parts must have their\r\n  blood-supply sufficiently near to allow them to absorb\r\n  it; comparison with an irrigation system in a garden.\r\n  Details of the process of nutrition in the ultimate\r\n  specific tissues; some are nourished from the blood\r\n  directly; in others a series of intermediate stages must\r\n  precede complete assimilation; for example, marrow is an\r\n  intermediate stage between blood and bone.\r\n\r\n  From the generalisations arrived at in the present work\r\n  we can deduce the explanation of all kinds of particular\r\n  phenomena; an instance is given, showing the\r\n  co-operation of various factors previously discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GALEN\r\n\r\n                   ON THE NATURAL FACULTIES[5]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BOOK I\r\n\r\n\r\n                                I\r\n\r\nSince feeling and voluntary motion are peculiar to animals, whilst\r\ngrowth and nutrition are common to plants as well, we may look on the\r\nformer as effects[6] of the _soul_[7] and the latter as effects of the\r\n_nature_.[8] And if there be anyone who allows a share in soul to\r\nplants as well, and separates the two kinds of soul, naming the kind\r\nin question _vegetative_, and the other _sensory_, this person is not\r\nsaying anything else, although his language is somewhat unusual. We,\r\nhowever, for our part, are convinced that the chief merit of language\r\nis clearness, and we know that nothing detracts so much from this as\r\ndo unfamiliar terms; accordingly we employ those terms which the bulk\r\nof people are accustomed to use, and we say that animals are governed\r\nat once by their soul and by their nature, and plants by their nature\r\nalone, and that growth and nutrition are the effects of nature, not of\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    GALÊNOU\r\n\r\n             PERI PHYSIKÔN DYNAMEÔN\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A\r\n\r\n\r\n                        I\r\n\r\n  Epeidê to men aisthanesthai te kai kineisthai kata              1\r\n  proairesin idia tôn zôôn esti, to d' auxanesthai te kai\r\n  trephesthai koina kai tois phytois, eiê an ta men\r\n  protera tês psychês, ta de deutera tês physeôs erga. ei\r\n  de tis kai tois phytois psychês metadidôsi kai\r\n  diairoumenos autas onomazei phytikên men tautên,\r\n  aisthêtikên de tên heteran, legei men oud' houtos alla,\r\n  tê lexei d' ou pany tê synêthei kechrêtai. all' hêmeis\r\n  ge megistên lexeôs aretên saphêneian einai pepeismenoi\r\n  kai tautên eidotes || hyp' oudenos houtôs hôs hypo tôn          2\r\n  asynêthôn onomatôn diaphtheiromenên, hôs tois pollois\r\n  ethos, houtôs onomazontes hypo men psychês th' hama kai\r\n  physeôs ta zôa dioikeisthai phamen, hypo de physeôs\r\n  monês ta phyta kai to g' auxanesthai te kai trephesthai\r\n  physeôs erga phamen, ou psychês.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              II\r\n\r\nThus we shall enquire, in the course of this treatise, from what\r\n_faculties_ these effects themselves, as well as any other effects of\r\nnature which there may be, take their origin.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, we must distinguish and explain clearly the various\r\nterms which we are going to use in this treatise, and to what things\r\nwe apply them; and this will prove to be not merely an explanation of\r\nterms but at the same time a demonstration of the effects of nature.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, such and such a body undergoes no change from its\r\nexisting state, we say that it is _at rest_; but, if it departs from\r\nthis in any respect we then say that in this respect it _undergoes\r\nmotion_.[9] Accordingly, when it departs in various ways from its\r\npre-existing state, it will be said to undergo various kinds of\r\nmotion. Thus, if that which is white becomes black, or what is black\r\nbecomes white, it undergoes motion in respect to _colour_; or if what\r\nwas previously sweet now becomes bitter, or, conversely, from being\r\nbitter now becomes sweet, it will be said to undergo motion in respect\r\nto _flavour_; to both of these instances, as well as to those\r\npreviously mentioned, we shall apply the term _qualitative motion_.\r\nAnd further, it is not only things which are altered in regard to\r\ncolour and flavour which, we say, undergo motion; when a warm thing\r\nbecomes cold, and a cold warm, here, too we speak of its undergoing\r\nmotion; similarly also when anything moist becomes dry, or dry\r\nmoist. Now, the common term which we apply to all these cases is\r\n_alteration_.\r\n\r\nThis is one kind of motion. But there is another kind which occurs in\r\nbodies which change their position, or as we say, pass from one place\r\nto another; the name of this is _transference_.[10]\r\n\r\nThese two kinds of motion, then, are simple and primary, while\r\ncompounded from them we have _growth_ and _decay_,[11] as when a small\r\nthing becomes bigger, or a big thing smaller, each retaining at the\r\nsame time its particular form. And two other kinds of motion are\r\n_genesis_ and _destruction_,[12] genesis being a coming into\r\nexistence,[13] and destruction being the opposite.\r\n\r\nNow, common to all kinds of motion is _change from the pre-existing\r\nstate_, while common to all conditions of rest is _retention of the\r\npre-existing state_. The Sophists, however, while allowing that bread\r\nin turning into blood becomes changed as regards sight, taste, and\r\ntouch, will not agree that this change occurs in reality. Thus some of\r\nthem hold that all such phenomena are tricks and illusions of our\r\nsenses; the senses, they say, are affected now in one way, now in\r\nanother, whereas the underlying substance does not admit of any of\r\nthese changes to which the names are given. Others (such as\r\nAnaxagoras)[14] will have it that the qualities do exist in it, but\r\nthat they are unchangeable and immutable from eternity to eternity,\r\nand that these apparent alterations are brought about by _separation_\r\nand _combination_.\r\n\r\nNow, if I were to go out of my way to confute these people, my\r\nsubsidiary task would be greater than my main one. Thus, if they do\r\nnot know all that has been written, \"On Complete Alteration of\r\nSubstance\"[15] by Aristotle, and after him by Chrysippus,[16] I must\r\nbeg of them to make themselves familiar with these men's writings. If,\r\nhowever, they know these, and yet willingly prefer the worse views to\r\nthe better, they will doubtless consider my arguments foolish also. I\r\nhave shown elsewhere that these opinions were shared by Hippocrates,\r\nwho lived much earlier than Aristotle. In fact, of all those known to\r\nus who have been both physicians and philosophers Hippocrates was the\r\nfirst who took in hand to demonstrate that there are, in all, four\r\nmutually interacting _qualities_, and that to the operation of these\r\nis due the genesis and destruction of all things that come into and\r\npass out of being. Nay, more; Hippocrates was also the first to\r\nrecognise that all these qualities undergo an intimate mingling with\r\none another; and at least the beginnings of the proofs to which\r\nAristotle later set his hand are to be found first in the writings of\r\nHippocrates.\r\n\r\nAs to whether we are to suppose that the _substances_ as well as their\r\n_qualities_ undergo this intimate mingling, as Zeno of Citium\r\nafterwards declared, I do not think it necessary to go further into\r\nthis question in the present treatise;[17] for immediate purposes we\r\nonly need to recognize the _complete alteration of substance_. In\r\nthis way, nobody will suppose that bread represents a kind of\r\nmeeting-place[18] for bone, flesh, nerve, and all the other parts, and\r\nthat each of these subsequently becomes separated in the body and goes\r\nto join its own kind;[19] before any separation takes place, the whole\r\nof the bread obviously becomes blood; (at any rate, if a man takes no\r\nother food for a prolonged period, he will have blood enclosed in his\r\nveins all the same).[20] And clearly this disproves the view of those\r\nwho consider the elements[21] unchangeable, as also, for that matter,\r\ndoes the oil which is entirely used up in the flame of the lamp, or\r\nthe faggots which, in a somewhat longer time, turn into fire.\r\n\r\nI said, however, that I was not going to enter into an argument with\r\nthese people, and it was only because the example was drawn from the\r\nsubject-matter of medicine, and because I need it for the present\r\ntreatise, that I have mentioned it. We shall then, as I said, renounce\r\nour controversy with them, since those who wish may get a good grasp\r\nof the views of the ancients from our own personal investigations into\r\nthese matters.\r\n\r\nThe discussion which follows we shall devote entirely, as we\r\noriginally proposed, to an enquiry into the number and character of\r\nthe _faculties_ of Nature, and what is the effect which each naturally\r\nproduces. Now, of course, I mean by an effect[22] that which has\r\nalready come into existence and has been completed by the\r\n_activity_[23] of these faculties--for example, blood, flesh, or\r\nnerve. And _activity_ is the name I give to the active change or\r\n_motion_, and the _cause_ of this I call a _faculty_. Thus, when food\r\nturns into blood, the motion of the food is passive, and that of the\r\nvein active. Similarly, when the limbs have their position altered, it\r\nis the muscle which produces, and the bones which undergo the motion.\r\nIn these cases I call the motion of the vein and of the muscle an\r\n_activity_, and that of the food and the bones a _symptom_ or\r\n_affection_,[24] since the first group undergoes _alteration_ and the\r\nsecond group is merely _transported_. One might, therefore, also speak\r\nof the _activity_ as an _effect_ of Nature[25]--for example,\r\ndigestion, absorption,[26] blood-production; one could not, however,\r\nin every case call the effect an activity; thus flesh is an effect of\r\nNature, but it is, of course, not an activity. It is, therefore, clear\r\nthat one of these terms is used in two senses, but not the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       II\r\n\r\n  Kai zêtêsomen kata tonde ton logon, hypo tinôn gignetai\r\n  dynameôn auta dê tauta kai ei dê ti allo physeôs ergon\r\n  estin.\r\n\r\n  Alla proteron ge dielesthai te chrê kai mênysai saphôs\r\n  hekaston tôn onomatôn, hois chrêsometha kata tonde ton\r\n  logon, kai eph' ho ti pheromen pragma. genêsetai de\r\n  tout' euthys ergôn physikôn didaskalia syn tais tôn\r\n  onomatôn exêgêsesin.\r\n\r\n  Hotan oun ti sôma kata mêden exallattêtai tôn\r\n  proÿparchontôn, hêsychazein auto phamen;

There are, however, a\r\nconsiderable number of not undistinguished men--philosophers and\r\nphysicians--who refer action to the Warm and the Cold, and who\r\nsubordinate to these, as passive, the Dry and the Moist; Aristotle, in\r\nfact, was the first who attempted to bring back the causes of the\r\nvarious special activities to these principles, and he was followed\r\nlater by the Stoic school. These latter, of course, could logically\r\nmake active principles of the Warm and Cold, since they refer the\r\nchange of the elements themselves into one another to certain\r\n_diffusions_ and _condensations_.[28] This does not hold of Aristotle,\r\nhowever; seeing that he employed the four qualities to explain the\r\ngenesis of the elements, he ought properly to have also referred the\r\ncauses of all the special activities to these. How is it that he uses\r\nthe four qualities in his book \"On Genesis and Destruction,\" whilst in\r\nhis \"Meteorology,\" his \"Problems,\" and many other works he uses the\r\ntwo only? Of course, if anyone were to maintain that in the case of\r\nanimals and plants the Warm and Cold are _more_ active, the Dry and\r\nMoist _less_ so, he might perhaps have even Hippocrates on his side;\r\nbut if he were to say that this happens in all cases, he would, I\r\nimagine, lack support, not merely from Hippocrates, but even from\r\nAristotle himself--if, at least, Aristotle chose to remember what he\r\nhimself taught us in his work \"On Genesis and Destruction,\" not as a\r\nmatter of simple statement, but with an accompanying demonstration. I\r\nhave, however, also investigated these questions, in so far as they\r\nare of value to a physician, in my work \"On Temperaments.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                      III\r\n\r\n  Emoi men oun kai hê phleps kai tôn allôn hapantôn\r\n  hekaston dia tên ek tôn tettarôn poian krasin hôdi pôs\r\n  energein dokei. eisi de ge mên ouk oligoi tines andres\r\n  || oud' adoxoi, philosophoi te kai iatroi, tô men thermô        8\r\n  kai tô psychrô to dran anapherontes, hypoballontes d'\r\n  autois pathêtika to xêron te kai to hygron. kai prôtos\r\n  g' Aristotelês tas tôn kata meros hapantôn aitias eis\r\n  tautas anagein peiratai tas archas, êkolouthêse d'\r\n  hysteron autô kai ho apo tês stoas choros. kaitoi\r\n  toutois men, hôs an kai autôn tôn stoicheiôn tên eis\r\n  allêla metabolên chysesi te tisi kai pilêsesin\r\n  anapherousin, eulogon ên archas drastikas poiêsasthai to\r\n  thermon kai to psychron, Aristotelei d' ouch houtôs,\r\n  alla tais tettarsi poiotêsin eis tên tôn stoicheiôn\r\n  genesin chrômenô beltion ên kai tas tôn kata meros\r\n  aitias hapasas eis tautas anagein. ti dêpot' oun en men\r\n  tois peri geneseôs kai phthoras tais tettarsi chrêtai,\r\n  en de tois meteôrologikois kai tois problêmasi kai\r\n  allothi pollachothi tais dyo monais? ei men gar hôs en\r\n  tois zôois te kai tois phytois mallon men dra to thermon\r\n  kai to psychron, hêtton de to xêron kai to hygron\r\n  apophainoito tis, isôs an echoi kai ton Hippokratên\r\n  sympsêphon; ei d' hôsautôs en || hapasin, ouket' oimai          9\r\n  synchôrêsein touto mê hoti ton Hippokratên alla mêd'\r\n  auton ton Aristotelên memnêsthai ge boulomenon hôn en\r\n  tois peri geneseôs kai phthoras ouch haplôs alla met'\r\n  apodeixeôs autos hêmas edidaxen. alla peri men toutôn\r\n  kan tois peri kraseôn, eis hoson iatrô chrêsimon,\r\n  epeskepsametha.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IV\r\n\r\nThe so-called _blood-making_[29] faculty in the veins, then, as well\r\nas all the other faculties, fall within the category of relative\r\nconcepts; primarily because the faculty is the cause of the activity,\r\nbut also, accidentally, because it is the cause of the effect. But if\r\nthe cause is relative to something--for it is the cause of what\r\nresults from it, and of nothing else--it is obvious that the faculty\r\nalso falls into the category of the relative; and so long as we are\r\nignorant of the true essence of the cause which is operating, we call\r\nit a _faculty_. Thus we say that there exists in the veins a\r\nblood-making faculty, as also a digestive[30] faculty in the stomach,\r\na pulsatile[31] faculty in the heart, and in each of the other parts a\r\nspecial faculty corresponding to the function or activity of that\r\npart. If, therefore, we are to investigate methodically the number and\r\nkinds of faculties, we must begin with the effects; for each of these\r\neffects comes from a certain activity, and each of these again is\r\npreceded by a cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IV\r\n\r\n  Hê d' oun dynamis hê en tais phlepsin hê haimatopoiêtikê\r\n  prosagoreuomenê kai pasa d' allê dynamis en tô pros ti\r\n  nenoêtai; prôtôs men gar tês energeias aitia, êdê de kai\r\n  tou ergou kata symbebêkos. all' eiper hê aitia pros ti,\r\n  tou gar hyp' autês genomenou monou, tôn d' allôn\r\n  oudenos, eudêlon, hoti kai hê dynamis en tô pros ti. kai\r\n  mechri g' an agnoômen tên ousian tês energousês aitias,\r\n  dynamin autên onomazomen, einai tina legontes en tais\r\n  phlepsin haimatopoiêtikên, hôsautôs de kan tê koilia\r\n  peptikên kan tê kardia sphygmikên kai kath' hekaston tôn\r\n  allôn idian tina tês || kata to morion energeias. eiper        10\r\n  oun methodô melloimen exeurêsein, hoposai te kai hopoiai\r\n  tines hai dynameis eisin, apo tôn ergôn autôn arkteon;\r\n  hekaston gar autôn hypo tinos energeias gignetai kai\r\n  toutôn hekastês proêgeitai tis aitia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               V\r\n\r\nThe effects of Nature, then, while the animal is still being formed in\r\nthe womb, are all the different _parts_ of its body; and after it has\r\nbeen born, an effect in which all parts share is the progress of each\r\nto its full size, and thereafter its maintenance of itself as long as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe activities corresponding to the three effects mentioned are\r\nnecessarily three--one to each--namely, Genesis, Growth, and\r\nNutrition. Genesis, however, is not a simple activity of Nature, but\r\nis compounded of _alteration_ and of _shaping_.[32] That is to say, in\r\norder that bone, nerve, veins, and all other [tissues] may come into\r\nexistence, the _underlying substance_ from which the animal springs\r\nmust be _altered_; and in order that the substance so altered may\r\nacquire its appropriate shape and position, its cavities, outgrowths,\r\nattachments, and so forth, it has to undergo a _shaping_ or\r\n_formative_ process.[33] One would be justified in calling this\r\nsubstance which undergoes alteration the _material_ of the animal,\r\njust as wood is the material of a ship, and wax of an image.\r\n\r\n_Growth_ is an increase and expansion in length, breadth, and\r\nthickness of the solid parts of the animal (those which have been\r\nsubjected to the moulding or shaping process). _Nutrition_ is an\r\naddition to these, without expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        V\r\n\r\n  Erga toinyn tês physeôs eti men kyoumenou te kai\r\n  diaplattomenou tou zôou ta sympant' esti tou sômatos\r\n  moria, gennêthentos de koinon eph' hapasin ergon hê eis\r\n  to teleion hekastô megethos agôgê kai meta tauth' hê\r\n  mechri tou dynatou diamonê.\r\n\r\n  Energeiai d' epi trisi tois eirêmenois ergois treis ex\r\n  anankês, eph' hekastô mia, genesis te kai auxêsis kai\r\n  threpsis. all' hê men genesis ouch haplê tis energeia\r\n  tês physeôs, all' ex alloiôseôs te kai diaplaseôs esti\r\n  synthetos. hina men gar ostoun genêtai kai neuron kai\r\n  phleps kai tôn allôn hekaston, alloiousthai chrê tên\r\n  hypobeblêmenên ousian, ex hês gignetai to zôon; hina de\r\n  kai schêma to deon kai thesin kai koilotêtas tinas kai\r\n  apophyseis kai symphyseis kai talla || ta toiauta              11\r\n  ktêsêtai, diaplattesthai chrê tên alloioumenên ousian,\r\n  hên dê kai hylên tou zôou kalôn, hôs tês neôs ta xyla\r\n  kai tês eikonos ton kêron, ouk an hamartois.\r\n\r\n  Hê d' auxêsis epidosis esti kai diastasis kata mêkos kai\r\n  platos kai bathos tôn stereôn tou zôou moriôn, hônper\r\n  kai hê diaplasis ên, hê de threpsis prosthesis tois\r\n  autois aneu diastaseôs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              VI\r\n\r\nLet us speak then, in the first place, of Genesis, which, as we have\r\nsaid, results from _alteration_ together with _shaping_.\r\n\r\nThe seed having been cast into the womb or into the earth (for there\r\nis no difference),[34] then, after a certain definite period, a great\r\nnumber of parts become constituted in the substance which is being\r\ngenerated; these differ as regards moisture, dryness, coldness and\r\nwarmth,[35] and in all the other qualities which naturally derive\r\ntherefrom.[36] These derivative qualities, you are acquainted with, if\r\nyou have given any sort of scientific consideration to the question of\r\ngenesis and destruction. For, first and foremost after the qualities\r\nmentioned come the other so-called _tangible_ distinctions, and after\r\nthem those which appeal to taste, smell, and sight. Now, tangible\r\ndistinctions are hardness and softness, viscosity, friability,\r\nlightness, heaviness, density, rarity, smoothness, roughness,\r\nthickness and thinness; all of these have been duly mentioned by\r\nAristotle.[37] And of course you know those which appeal to taste,\r\nsmell, and sight. Therefore, if you wish to know which alterative\r\nfaculties are primary and elementary, they are moisture, dryness,\r\ncoldness, and warmth, and if you wish to know which ones arise from\r\nthe combination of these, they will be found to be in each animal of a\r\nnumber corresponding to its _sensible elements_. The name _sensible\r\nelements_ is given to all the _homogeneous_[38] parts of the body, and\r\nthese are to be detected not by any system, but by personal\r\nobservation of dissections.[39]\r\n\r\nNow Nature constructs bone, cartilage, nerve, membrane, ligament,\r\nvein, and so forth, at the first stage of the animal's genesis,[40]\r\nemploying at this task a faculty which is, in general terms,\r\ngenerative and alterative, and, in more detail, warming, chilling,\r\ndrying, or moistening; or such as spring from the blending of\r\nthese, for example, the bone-producing, nerve-producing, and\r\ncartilage-producing faculties[41] (since for the sake of clearness\r\nthese names must be used as well).\r\n\r\nNow the peculiar[42] flesh of the liver is of this kind as well, also\r\nthat of the spleen, that of the kidneys, that of the lungs, and that\r\nof the heart; so also the proper substance of the brain, stomach,\r\ngullet, intestines, and uterus is _a sensible element_, of similar\r\nparts all through, simple, and uncompounded. That is to say, if you\r\nremove from each of the organs mentioned its arteries, veins, and\r\nnerves,[43] the substance remaining in each organ is, from the point\r\nof view of the senses, simple and elementary. As regards those organs\r\nconsisting of two dissimilar _coats_,[44] of which each is simple, of\r\nthese organs the coats are the elements--for example, the coats of the\r\nstomach, oesophagus, intestines, and arteries; each of these two coats\r\nhas an alterative faculty peculiar to it, which has engendered it from\r\nthe menstrual blood of the mother. Thus the _special_ alterative\r\nfaculties in each animal are of the same number as the elementary\r\nparts[45]; and further, the _activities_ must necessarily correspond\r\neach to one of the special parts, just as each part has its special\r\n_use_--for example, those ducts which extend from the kidneys into the\r\nbladder, and which are called _ureters_; for these are not arteries,\r\nsince they do not pulsate nor do they consist of two coats; and they\r\nare not veins, since they neither contain blood, nor do their coats\r\nin any way resemble those of veins; from nerves they differ still more\r\nthan from the structures mentioned.\r\n\r\n\"What, then, are they?\" someone asks--as though every part must\r\nnecessarily be either an artery, a vein, a nerve, or a complex of\r\nthese,[46] and as though the truth were not what I am now stating,\r\nnamely, that every one of the various organs has its own particular\r\nsubstance. For in fact the two bladders--that which receives the\r\nurine, and that which receives the yellow bile--not only differ from\r\nall other organs, but also from one another. Further, the ducts which\r\nspring out like kinds of conduits from the gall-bladder and which pass\r\ninto the liver have no resemblance either to arteries, veins or\r\nnerves. But these parts have been treated at a greater length in my\r\nwork \"On the Anatomy of Hippocrates,\" as well as elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs for the actual substance of the coats of the stomach, intestine,\r\nand uterus, each of these has been rendered what it is by a special\r\nalterative faculty of Nature; while the bringing of these\r\ntogether,[47] the combination therewith of the structures which are\r\ninserted into them, the outgrowth into the intestine,[48] the shape of\r\nthe inner cavities, and the like, have all been determined by a\r\nfaculty which we call the shaping or formative faculty[49]; this\r\nfaculty we also state to be _artistic_--nay, the best and highest\r\nart--doing everything for some purpose, so that there is nothing\r\nineffective or superfluous, or capable of being better disposed. This,\r\nhowever, I shall demonstrate in my work \"On the Use of Parts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                       VI\r\n\r\n  Peri prôtês oun tês geneseôs eipômen, hên ex alloiôseôs\r\n  th' hama kai diaplaseôs elegomen gignesthai.\r\n\r\n  Katablêthentos dê tou spermatos eis tên mêtran ê eis tên\r\n  gên, ouden gar diapherei, chronois tisin hôrismenois\r\n  pampolla synistatai moria tês gennômenês ousias\r\n  hygrotêti kai xêrotêti kai psychrotêti kai thermotêti\r\n  kai tois allois hapasin, hosa toutois hepetai,\r\n  diapheronta. ta d' hepomena gignôskeis, eiper holôs\r\n  ephilosophêsas ti peri geneseôs kai phthoras; hai loipai\r\n  gar tôn haptôn onomazomenôn diaphorôn tais eirêmenais\r\n  hepontai prôtai kai malista, meta de tau||tas hai              12\r\n  geustai te kai osphrêtai kai horatai. sklêrotês men oun\r\n  kai malakotês kai glischrotês kai kraurotês kai\r\n  kouphotês kai barytês kai pyknotês kai araiotês kai\r\n  leiotês kai trachytês kai pachytês kai leptotês haptai\r\n  diaphorai kai eirêtai peri pasôn Aristotelei kalôs.\r\n  oistha de dêpou kai tas geustas te kai osphrêtas kai\r\n  horatas diaphoras. hôst', ei men tas prôtas te kai\r\n  stoicheiôdeis alloiôtikas dynameis zêtoiês, hygrotês\r\n  esti kai xêrotês kai psychrotês kai thermotês; ei de tas\r\n  ek tês toutôn kraseôs genomenas, tosautai kath' hekaston\r\n  esontai zôon, hosaper an autou ta aisthêta stoicheia\r\n  hyparchê; kaleitai d' aisthêta stoicheia ta homoiomerê\r\n  panta tou sômatos moria; kai taut' ouk ek methodou tinos\r\n  all' autoptên genomenon ekmathein chrê dia tôn anatomôn.\r\n\r\n  Ostoun dê kai chondron kai neuron kai hymena kai\r\n  syndesmon kai phleba kai panth' hosa toiauta kata tên\r\n  prôtên tou zôou genesin hê physis apergazetai dynamei\r\n  chrômenê katholou men eipein tê gennêtikê te kai\r\n  alloiô||tikê, kata meros de thermantikê te kai psyktikê        13\r\n  kai xêrantikê kai hygrantikê kai tais ek tês toutôn\r\n  kraseôs genomenais, hoion ostopoiêtikê te kai\r\n  neuropoiêtikê kai chondropoiêtikê; saphêneias gar heneka\r\n  kai toutois tois onomasi chrêsteon.\r\n\r\n  Esti goun kai hê idia sarx tou hêpatos ek toutou tou\r\n  genous kai hê tou splênos kai hê tôn nephrôn kai hê tou\r\n  pneumonos kai hê tês kardias houtô de kai tou enkephalou\r\n  to idion sôma kai tês gastros kai tou stomachou kai tôn\r\n  enterôn kai tôn hysterôn aisthêton stoicheion estin\r\n  homoiomeres te kai haploun kai asyntheton; ean gar\r\n  exelês hekastou tôn eirêmenôn tas artêrias te kai tas\r\n  phlebas kai ta neura, to hypoloipon sôma to kath'\r\n  hekaston organon haploun esti kai stoicheiôdes hôs pros\r\n  aisthêsin. hosa de tôn toioutôn organôn ek dyoin\r\n  synkeitai chitônôn ouch homoiôn men allêlois, haplou d'\r\n  hekaterou, toutôn hoi chitônes eisi ta stoicheia\r\n  kathaper tês te gastros kai tou stomachou kai tôn\r\n  enterôn kai tôn artêriôn, kai kath' hekateron ge tôn\r\n  chitônôn idios hê alloiôtikê dynamis hê ek tou para tês\r\n  || mêtros epimêniou gennêsasa to morion, hôste tas kata        14\r\n  meros alloiôtikas dynameis tosautas einai kath' hekaston\r\n  zôon, hosaper an echê ta stoicheiôdê moria. kai men ge\r\n  kai tas energeias idias hekastô tôn kata meros anankaion\r\n  hyparchein hôsper kai tas chreias, hoion kai tôn apo tôn\r\n  nephrôn eis tên kystin diêkontôn porôn, hoi dê kai\r\n  ourêtêres kalountai. houtoi gar out' artêriai eisin,\r\n  hoti mête sphyzousi mêt' ek dyoin chitônôn synestêkasin,\r\n  oute phlebes, hoti mêth' haima periechousi mêt' eoiken\r\n  autôn ho chitôn kata ti tô tês phlebos; alla kai neurôn\r\n  epi pleon aphestêkasin ê tôn eirêmenôn.\r\n\r\n  Ti pot' oun eisin?

When, however, the animal[52]\r\nhas attained its complete size, then, during the whole period\r\nfollowing its birth and until the acme is reached, the faculty of\r\ngrowth is predominant, while the alterative and nutritive faculties\r\nare accessory--in fact, act as its handmaids. What, then, is the\r\nproperty of this faculty of growth? To extend in every direction that\r\nwhich has already come into existence--that is to say, the solid parts\r\nof the body, the arteries, veins, nerves, bones, cartilages,\r\nmembranes, ligaments, and the various _coats_ which we have just\r\ncalled elementary, homogeneous, and simple. And I shall state in what\r\nway they gain this extension in every direction, first giving an\r\nillustration for the sake of clearness.\r\n\r\nChildren take the bladders of pigs, fill them with air, and then rub\r\nthem on ashes near the fire, so as to warm, but not to injure them.\r\nThis is a common game in the district of Ionia, and among not a few\r\nother nations. As they rub, they sing songs, to a certain measure,\r\ntime, and rhythm, and all their words are an exhortation to the\r\nbladder to increase in size. When it appears to them fairly well\r\ndistended, they again blow air into it and expand it further; then\r\nthey rub it again. This they do several times, until the bladder seems\r\nto them to have become large enough. Now, clearly, in these doings of\r\nthe children, the more the interior cavity of the bladder increases in\r\nsize, the thinner, necessarily, does its substance become. But, if the\r\nchildren were able to bring nourishment to this thin part, then they\r\nwould make the bladder big in the same way that Nature does. As it is,\r\nhowever, they cannot do what Nature does, for to imitate this is\r\nbeyond the power not only of children, but of any one soever; it is a\r\nproperty of Nature alone.\r\n\r\nIt will now, therefore, be clear to you that _nutrition_ is a\r\nnecessity for growing things. For if such bodies were distended, but\r\nnot at the same time nourished, they would take on a false appearance\r\nof growth, not a true growth. And further, to be distended _in all\r\ndirections_ belongs only to bodies whose growth is directed by Nature;\r\nfor those which are distended by us undergo this distension in one\r\ndirection but grow less in the others; it is impossible to find a body\r\nwhich will remain entire and not be torn through whilst we stretch it\r\nin the three dimensions. Thus Nature alone has the power to expand a\r\nbody in all directions so that it remains unruptured and preserves\r\ncompletely its previous form.\r\n\r\nSuch then is _growth_, and it cannot occur without the nutriment which\r\nflows to the part and is worked up into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VII\r\n\r\n  Epi de tên auxêtikên êdê metabantes dynamin auto touth'\r\n  hypomnêsômen prôton, hôs hyparchei men kai autê tois\r\n  kyoumenois hôsper kai hê threptikê; all' hoion\r\n  hypêretides tines eisi tênikauta tôn proeirêmenôn\r\n  dynameôn, ouk en hautais echousai to pan kyros. epeidan\r\n  de to teleion apolabê megethos to zôon, en tô meta tên\r\n  apokyêsin chronô panti mechri tês akmês hê men auxêtikê\r\n  tênikauta kratei; boêthoi d' autês kai hoion hypêretides\r\n  hê t' alloiôtikê dynamis esti kai hê threptikê. ti oun\r\n  to idion esti tês auxêtikês dynameôs? eis pan meros\r\n  ekteinai ta pephykota. kaleitai d' houtô ta sterea moria\r\n  tou sômatos, artêriai kai phlebes kai neura kai osta kai\r\n  chondroi kai hymenes kai syndesmoi kai hoi chitônes\r\n  hapantes, hous stoicheiôdeis te kai homoiomereis kai\r\n  haplous oligon emprosthen ekaloumen. hotô de tropô tên\r\n  eis pan meros ektasin ischousin, egô phrasô paradeigma\r\n  ti proteron eipôn heneka tou saphous. ||                       17\r\n\r\n  Tas kysteis tôn hyôn labontes hoi paides plêrousi te\r\n  pneumatos kai tribousin epi tês tephras plêsion tou\r\n  pyros, hôs aleainesthai men, blaptesthai de mêden; kai\r\n  pollê g' hautê hê paidia peri te tên Iônian kai en\r\n  allois ethnesin ouk oligois estin. epilegousi de dê kai\r\n  tin' epê tribontes en metrô te tini kai melei kai\r\n  rhythmô kai esti panta ta rhêmata tauta parakeleusis tê\r\n  kystei pros tên auxêsin. epeidan d' hikanôs autois\r\n  diatetasthai dokê, palin emphysôsi te kai epidiateinousi\r\n  kai authis tribousi kai touto pleonakis poiousin, achris\r\n  an autois hê kystis hikanôs echein dokê tês auxêseôs.\r\n  all' en toutois ge tois ergois tôn paidôn enargôs, hoson\r\n  eis megethos epididôsin hê entos eurychôria tês kysteôs,\r\n  tosouton anankaion eis leptotêta kathaireisthai to sôma\r\n  kai ei ge tên leptotêta tautên anatrephein hoioi t' êsan\r\n  hoi paides, homoiôs an tê physei tên kystin ek mikras\r\n  megalên apeirgazonto. nyni de tout' autois endei to\r\n  ergon oude kath' hena tropon eis mimêsin endechomenon\r\n  achthênai mê hoti tois || paisin all' oud' allô tini;          18\r\n  monês gar tês physeôs idion estin.\r\n\r\n  Hôst' êdê soi dêlon, hôs anankaia tois auxanomenois hê\r\n  threpsis. ei gar diateinoito men, anatrephoito de mê,\r\n  phantasian pseudê mallon, ouk auxêsin alêthê ta toiauta\r\n  sômata ktêsetai. kaitoi kai to diateinesthai pantê\r\n  monois tois hypo physeôs auxanomenois hyparchei. ta gar\r\n  hyph' hêmôn diateinomena sômata kata mian tina diastasin\r\n  touto paschonta meioutai tais loipais, oud' estin\r\n  heurein ouden, ho syneches eti menon kai adiaspaston eis\r\n  tas treis diastaseis epekteinai dynametha. monês oun tês\r\n  physeôs to pantê diistanai syneches heautô menon eti kai\r\n  tên archaian hapasan idean phylatton to sôma.\r\n\r\n  Kai tout' estin hê auxêsis aneu tês epirrheousês te kai\r\n  prosplattomenês trophês mê dynamenê genesthai.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VIII\r\n\r\nWe have, then, it seems, arrived at the subject of Nutrition, which is\r\nthe third and remaining consideration which we proposed at the outset.\r\nFor, when the matter which flows to each part of the body in the form\r\nof nutriment is being worked up into it, this activity is _nutrition_,\r\nand its cause is the _nutritive faculty_. Of course, the kind of\r\nactivity here involved is also an _alteration_, but not an alteration\r\nlike that occurring at the stage of _genesis_.[53] For in the latter\r\ncase something comes into existence which did not exist previously,\r\nwhile in nutrition the inflowing material becomes assimilated to that\r\nwhich has already come into existence. Therefore, the former kind of\r\nalteration has with reason been termed _genesis_, and the latter,\r\n_assimilation_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     VIII\r\n\r\n  Kai toinyn ho logos hêkein eoiken ho peri tês threpseôs,\r\n  hos dê loipos esti kai tritos hôn ex archês\r\n  prouthemetha. tou gar epirrheontos en eidei trophês\r\n  panti || moriô tou trephomenou sômatos prosplattomenou         19\r\n  threpsis men hê energeia, threptikê de dynamis hê aitia.\r\n  alloiôsis men dê kantautha to genos tês energeias, all'\r\n  ouch hoiaper hê en tê genesei. ekei men gar ouk on\r\n  proteron hysteron egeneto, kata de tên threpsin tô êdê\r\n  gegonoti synexomoioutai to epirrheon kai dia tout'\r\n  eulogôs ekeinên men tên alloiôsin genesin, tautên d'\r\n  exomoiôsin ônomasan.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IX\r\n\r\nNow, since the three faculties of Nature have been exhaustively dealt\r\nwith, and the animal would appear not to need any others (being\r\npossessed of the means for growing, for attaining completion, and for\r\nmaintaining itself as long a time as possible), this treatise might\r\nseem to be already complete, and to constitute an exposition of all\r\nthe faculties of Nature. If, however, one considers that it has not\r\nyet touched upon any of _the parts_ of the animal (I mean the stomach,\r\nintestines, liver, and the like), and that it has not dealt with the\r\nfaculties resident in these, it will seem as though merely a kind of\r\nintroduction had been given to the practical parts of our teaching.\r\nFor the whole matter is as follows: Genesis, growth, and nutrition are\r\nthe first, and, so to say, the principal effects of Nature; similarly\r\nalso the faculties which produce these effects--the first\r\nfaculties--are three in number, and are the most dominating of all.\r\nBut as has already been shown, these need the service both of each\r\nother, and of yet different faculties. Now, these which the faculties\r\nof generation and growth require have been stated. I shall now say\r\nwhat ones the nutritive faculty requires.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IX\r\n\r\n  Epeidê de peri tôn triôn dynameôn tês physeôs autarkôs\r\n  eirêtai kai phainetai mêdemias allês prosdeisthai to\r\n  zôon, echon ge kai hopôs auxêthê kai hopôs teleiôthê kai\r\n  hopôs heôs pleistou diaphylachthê, doxeie men an isôs\r\n  hikanôs echein ho logos houtos êdê kai pasas exêgeisthai\r\n  tas tês physeôs dynameis. all' ei tis palin ennoêseien,\r\n  hôs oudenos oudepô tôn tou zôou moriôn ephêpsato,\r\n  koilias legô kai enterôn kai hêpatos kai tôn homoiôn,\r\n  oud' exêgêsato tas en autois dynameis, authis doxeien an\r\n  hoion prooimion ti monon eirêsthai tês chrêsimou\r\n  didaskalias. || to gar sympan hôd' echei. genesis kai          20\r\n  auxêsis kai threpsis ta prôta kai hoion kephalaia tôn\r\n  ergôn esti tês physeôs; hôste kai hai toutôn ergastikai\r\n  dynameis hai prôtai treis eisi kai kyriôtatai; deontai\r\n  d' eis hypêresian, hôs êdê dedeiktai, kai allêlôn kai\r\n  allôn. tinôn men oun hê gennêtikê te kai auxêtikê\r\n  deontai, eirêtai, tinôn d' hê threptikê, nyn eirêsetai.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               X\r\n\r\nFor I believe that I shall prove that the organs which have to do with\r\nthe disposal[54] of the nutriment, as also their faculties, exist for\r\nthe sake of this _nutritive faculty_. For since the action of this\r\nfaculty[55] is _assimilation_, and it is impossible for anything to be\r\nassimilated by, and to change into anything else unless they already\r\npossess a certain _community and affinity_ in their qualities,[56]\r\ntherefore, in the first place, any animal cannot naturally derive\r\nnourishment from any kind of food, and secondly, even in the case of\r\nthose from which it can do so, it cannot do this at once. Therefore,\r\nby reason of this law,[57] every animal needs several organs for\r\n_altering_ the nutriment. For in order that the yellow may become red,\r\nand the red yellow, one simple process of alteration is required, but\r\nin order that the white may become black, and the black white, all the\r\nintermediate stages are needed.[58] So also, a thing which is very\r\nsoft cannot all at once become very hard, nor _vice versa_; nor,\r\nsimilarly can anything which has a very bad smell suddenly become\r\nquite fragrant, nor again, can the converse happen.\r\n\r\nHow, then, could blood ever turn into bone, without having first\r\nbecome, as far as possible, thickened and white? And how could bread\r\nturn into blood without having gradually parted with its whiteness and\r\ngradually acquired redness? Thus it is quite easy for blood to become\r\nflesh; for, if Nature thicken it to such an extent that it acquires a\r\ncertain consistency and ceases to be fluid, it thus becomes original\r\nnewly-formed flesh; but in order that blood may turn into bone, much\r\ntime is needed and much elaboration and transformation of the blood.\r\nFurther, it is quite clear that bread, and, more particularly lettuce,\r\nbeet, and the like, require a great deal of alteration in order to\r\nbecome blood.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is one reason why there are so many organs concerned in\r\nthe alteration of food. A second reason is the nature of the\r\n_superfluities_.[59] For, as we are unable to draw any nourishment\r\nfrom grass, although this is possible for cattle, similarly we can\r\nderive nourishment from radishes, albeit not to the same extent as\r\nfrom meat; for almost the whole of the latter is mastered by our\r\nnatures[60]; it is transformed and altered and constituted useful\r\nblood; but, in the radish, what is appropriate[61] and able of being\r\naltered (and that only with difficulty, and with much labour) is the\r\nvery smallest part; almost the whole of it is surplus matter, and\r\npasses through the digestive organs, only a very little being taken up\r\ninto the veins as blood--nor is this itself entirely utilisable blood.\r\nNature, therefore had need of a second process of separation for the\r\nsuperfluities in the veins. Moreover, these superfluities need, on the\r\none hand, certain fresh routes to conduct them to the outlets, so that\r\nthey may not spoil the useful substances, and they also need certain\r\n_reservoirs_, as it were, in which they are collected till they reach\r\na sufficient quantity, and are then discharged.\r\n\r\nThus, then, you have discovered bodily parts of a second kind,\r\nconsecrated in this case to the [removal of the] superfluities of the\r\nfood. There is, however, also a third kind, for carrying the pabulum\r\nin every direction; these are like a number of roads intersecting the\r\nwhole body.\r\n\r\nThus there is one entrance--that through the mouth--for all the\r\nvarious articles of food. What receives nourishment, however, is not\r\none single part, but a great many parts, and these widely separated;\r\ndo not be surprised, therefore, at the abundance of organs which\r\nNature has created for the purpose of nutrition. For those of them\r\nwhich have to do with alteration prepare the nutriment suitable for\r\neach part; others separate out the superfluities; some pass these\r\nalong, others store them up, others excrete them; some, again, are\r\npaths for the transit[62] in all directions of the _utilisable_\r\njuices. So, if you wish to gain a thorough acquaintance with all the\r\nfaculties of Nature,[63] you will have to consider each one of these\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nNow in giving an account of these we must begin with those effects of\r\nNature, together with their corresponding parts and faculties, which\r\nare closely connected with the purpose to be achieved.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        X\r\n\r\n  Dokô gar moi deixein ta peri tên tês trophês oikonomian\r\n  organa te kai tas dynameis autôn dia tautên gegonota.\r\n  epeidê gar hê energeia tautês tês dynameôs exomoiôsis\r\n  estin, homoiousthai de kai metaballein eis allêla pasi\r\n  tois ousin adynaton, ei mê tina echoi koinônian êdê kai\r\n  syngeneian en tais poiotêsi, dia touto prôton men ouk ek\r\n  pantôn edesmatôn pan zôon trephesthai pephyken, epeita\r\n  d' oud' ex hôn hoion t' estin oud' ek toutôn parachrêma,\r\n  kai dia tautên tên anankên pleionôn organôn alloiôtikôn\r\n  tês trophês hekaston || tôn zôôn chrêzei. hina men gar         21\r\n  to xanthon erythron genêtai kai to erythron xanthon,\r\n  haplês kai mias deitai tês alloiôseôs; hina de to leukon\r\n  melan kai to melan leukon, hapasôn tôn metaxy. kai\r\n  toinyn kai to malakôtaton ouk an athroôs sklêrotaton kai\r\n  to sklêrotaton ouk an athroôs malakôtaton genoito,\r\n  hôsper oude to dysôdestaton euôdestaton oud' empalin to\r\n  euôdestaton dysôdestaton exaiphnês genoit' an.\r\n\r\n  Pôs oun ex haimatos ostoun an pote genoito mê\r\n  pachynthentos ge proteron epi pleiston autou kai\r\n  leukanthentos ê pôs ex artou to haima mê kata brachy men\r\n  apothemenou tên leukotêta, kata brachy de lambanontos\r\n  tên erythrotêta? sarka men gar ex haimatos genesthai\r\n  rhaston; ei gar eis tosouton auto pachyneien hê physis,\r\n  hôs systasin tina schein kai mêket' einai rhyton, hê\r\n  prôtê kai neopagês houtôs an eiê sarx; ostoun d' hina\r\n  genêtai, pollou men deitai chronou, pollês d' ergasias\r\n  kai metabolês tô haimati. hoti de kai tô artô kai poly\r\n  mallon thrida||kinê kai teutlô kai tois homoiois               22\r\n  pampollês deitai tês alloiôseôs eis haimatos genesin,\r\n  oude tout' adêlon.\r\n\r\n  Hen men dê tout' aition tou polla genesthai ta peri tên\r\n  tês trophês alloiôsin organa. deuteron d' hê tôn\r\n  perittômatôn physis. hôs gar hypo botanôn oud' holôs\r\n  dynametha trephesthai, kaitoi tôn boskêmatôn\r\n  trephomenôn, houtôs hypo rhaphanidos trephometha men,\r\n  all' ouch hôs hypo tôn kreôn. toutôn men gar oligou dein\r\n  holôn hê physis hêmôn kratei kai metaballei kai alloioi\r\n  kai chrêston ex autôn haima synistêsin; en de tê\r\n  rhaphanidi to men oikeion te kai metablêthênai\r\n  dynamenon, mogis kai touto kai syn pollê tê katergasia,\r\n  pantapasin elachiston; holê d' oligou dein esti\r\n  perittômatikê kai diexerchetai ta tês pepseôs organa,\r\n  bracheos ex autês eis tas phlebas analêphthentos\r\n  haimatos kai oude toutou teleôs chrêstou. deuteras oun\r\n  authis edeêse diakriseôs tê physei tôn en tais phlepsi\r\n  perittômatôn. kai chreia kai toutois hodôn te tinôn\r\n  heterôn epi tas ek||kriseis auta paragousôn, hôs mê            23\r\n  lymainoito tois chrêstois, hypodochôn te tinôn hoion\r\n  dexamenôn, en hais hotan eis hikanon plêthos aphikêtai,\r\n  tênikaut' ekkrithêsetai.\r\n\r\n  Deuteron dê soi kai touto to genos tôn en tô sômati\r\n  moriôn exeurêtai tois perittômasi tês trophês\r\n  anakeimenon. allo de triton hyper tou pantê pheresthai,\r\n  kathaper tines hodoi pollai dia tou sômatos holou\r\n  katatetmêmenai.\r\n\r\n  Mia men gar eisodos hê dia tou stomatos hapasi tois\r\n  sitiois, ouch hen de to trephomenon alla pampolla te kai\r\n  pampoly diestôta. mê toinyn thaumaze to plêthos tôn\r\n  organôn, hosa threpseôs heneken hê physis edêmiourgêse.\r\n  ta men gar alloiounta proparaskeuazei tên epitêdeion\r\n  hekastô moriô trophên, ta de diakrinei ta perittômata,\r\n  ta de parapempei, ta d' hypodechetai, ta d' ekkrinei, ta\r\n  d' hodoi tês pantê phoras eisi tôn chrêstôn chymôn,\r\n  hôst', eiper boulei tas dynameis tês physeôs hapasas\r\n  ekmathein, hyper hekastou toutôn an eiê soi tôn organôn\r\n  episkepteon.\r\n\r\n  Archê d' autôn tês didaskalias, hosa || tou telous engys       24\r\n  erga te tês physeôs esti kai moria kai dynameis autôn.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              XI\r\n\r\nLet us once more, then, recall the actual purpose for which Nature has\r\nconstructed all these parts. Its name, as previously stated, is\r\n_nutrition_, and the definition corresponding to the name is: _an\r\nassimilation of that which nourishes to that which receives\r\nnourishments_.[65] And in order that this may come about, we must\r\nassume a preliminary process of _adhesion_,[66] and for that, again,\r\none of _presentation_.[67] For whenever the juice which is destined to\r\nnourish any of the parts of the animal is emitted from the vessels, it\r\nis in the first place dispersed all through this part, next it is\r\npresented, and next it adheres, and becomes completely assimilated.\r\n\r\nThe so-called white [leprosy] shows the difference between\r\nassimilation and adhesion, in the same way that the kind of dropsy\r\nwhich some people call _anasarca_ clearly distinguishes presentation\r\nfrom adhesion. For, of course, the genesis of such a dropsy does not\r\ncome about as do some of the conditions of atrophy and wasting,[68]\r\nfrom an insufficient supply of moisture; the flesh is obviously moist\r\nenough,--in fact it is thoroughly saturated,--and each of the solid\r\nparts of the body is in a similar condition. While, however, the\r\nnutriment conveyed to the part does undergo presentation, it is still\r\ntoo watery, and is not properly transformed into a _juice_,[69] nor\r\nhas it acquired that viscous and agglutinative quality which results\r\nfrom the operation of _innate heat_;[70] therefore, adhesion cannot\r\ncome about, since, owing to this abundance of thin, crude liquid, the\r\npabulum runs off and easily slips away from the solid parts of the\r\nbody. In white [leprosy], again, there is adhesion of the nutriment\r\nbut no real assimilation. From this it is clear that what I have just\r\nsaid is correct, namely, that in that part which is to be nourished\r\nthere must first occur presentation, next adhesion, and finally\r\nassimilation proper.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, then, _nutriment_ is that which is actually\r\nnourishing, while the _quasi-nutriment_ which is not yet nourishing\r\n(_e.g._ matter which is undergoing adhesion or presentation) is not,\r\nstrictly speaking, nutriment, but is so called only by an\r\nequivocation. Also, that which is still contained in the veins, and\r\nstill more, that which is in the stomach, from the fact that it is\r\ndestined to nourish if properly elaborated, has been called\r\n\"nutriment.\" Similarly we call the various kinds of food \"nutriment,\"\r\nnot because they are already nourishing the animal, nor because they\r\nexist in the same state as the material which actually is nourishing\r\nit, but because they are able and destined to nourish it if they be\r\nproperly elaborated.\r\n\r\nThis was also what Hippocrates said, viz., \"Nutriment is what is\r\nengaged in nourishing, as also is quasi-nutriment, and what is\r\ndestined to be nutriment.\" For to that which is already being\r\nassimilated he gave the name of _nutriment_; to the similar material\r\nwhich is being presented or becoming adherent, the name of\r\n_quasi-nutriment_; and to everything else--that is, contained in the\r\nstomach and veins--the name of _destined nutriment_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       XI\r\n\r\n  Autou de dê palin anamnêsteon hêmin tou telous, houper\r\n  heneka tosauta te kai toiauta tê physei dedêmiourgêtai\r\n  moria. to men oun onoma tou pragmatos, hôsper kai\r\n  proteron eirêtai, threpsis; ho de kata tounoma logos\r\n  homoiôsis tou trephontos tô trephomenô. hina d' hautê\r\n  genêtai, proêgêsasthai chrê prosphysin, hina d' ekeinê,\r\n  prosthesin. epeidan gar ekpesê tôn angeiôn ho mellôn\r\n  threpsein hotioun tôn tou zôou moriôn chymos, eis hapan\r\n  auto diaspeiretai prôton, epeita prostithetai kapeita\r\n  prosphyetai kai teleôs homoioutai.\r\n\r\n  Dêlousi d' hai kaloumenai leukai tên diaphoran\r\n  homoiôseôs te kai prosphyseôs, hôsper to genos ekeino\r\n  tôn hyderôn, ho tines onomazousin ana sarka, diorizei\r\n  saphôs prosthesin prosphyseôs. ou gar endeia dêpou tês\r\n  epirrheousês hygrotêtos, hôs eniai tôn atrophiôn te kai\r\n  phthiseôn, hê tou toioutou genesis hyderou ||                  25\r\n  synteleitai. phainetai gar hikanôs hê te sarx hygra kai\r\n  diabrochos hekaston te tôn stereôn tou sômatos moriôn\r\n  hôsautôs diakeimenon. alla prosthesis men tis gignetai\r\n  tês epipheromenês trophês, hate d' hydatôdesteras ousês\r\n  eti kai mê pany ti kechymômenês mêde to glischron ekeino\r\n  kai kollôdes, ho dê tês emphytou thermasias oikonomia\r\n  prosgignetai, kektêmenês hê prosphysis adynatos estin\r\n  epiteleisthai plêthei leptês hygrotêtos apeptou\r\n  diarrheousês te kai rhadiôs olisthainousês apo tôn\r\n  stereôn tou sômatos moriôn tês trophês. en de tais\r\n  leukais prosphysis men tis gignetai tês trophês, ou mên\r\n  exomoiôsis ge. kai dêlon en tôde to mikrô prosthen\r\n  rhêthen hôs orthôs elegeto to dein prosthesin men\r\n  prôton, ephexês de prosphysin, epeit' exomoiôsin\r\n  genesthai tô mellonti trephesthai.\r\n\r\n  Kyriôs men oun to trephon êdê trophê, to d' hoion men\r\n  trophê, oupô de trephon, hopoion esti to prosphyomenon ê\r\n  prostithemenon, trophê men ou kyriôs, homônymôs de\r\n  trophê; to d' en tais phlepsin eti periechomenon || kai        26\r\n  toutou mallon eti to kata tên gastera tô mellein pote\r\n  threpsein, ei kalôs katergastheiê, keklêtai trophê. kata\r\n  tauta de kai tôn edesmatôn hekaston trophên onomazomen\r\n  oute tô trephein êdê to zôon oute tô toiouton hyparchein\r\n  hoion to trephon, alla tô dynasthai te kai mellein\r\n  trephein, ei kalôs katergastheiê.\r\n\r\n  Touto gar ên kai to pros Hippokratous legomenon; \"Trophê\r\n  de to trephon, trophê kai to hoion trophê kai to\r\n  mellon.\" to men gar homoioumenon êdê trophên ônomase, to\r\n  d' hoion men ekeino prostithemenon ê prosphyomenon hoion\r\n  trophên; to d' allo pan, hoson en tê gastri kai tais\r\n  phlepsi periechetai, mellon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             XII\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear, therefore, that nutrition must necessarily be a\r\nprocess of assimilation of that which is nourishing to that which is\r\nbeing nourished. Some, however, say that this assimilation does not\r\noccur in reality, but is merely apparent; these are the people who\r\nthink that Nature is not artistic, that she does not show forethought\r\nfor the animal's welfare, and that she has absolutely no native powers\r\nwhereby she alters some substances, attracts others, and discharges\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nNow, speaking generally, there have arisen the following two sects in\r\nmedicine and philosophy among those who have made any definite\r\npronouncement regarding Nature. I speak, of course, of such of them as\r\nknow what they are talking about, and who realize the logical sequence\r\nof their hypotheses, and stand by them; as for those who cannot\r\nunderstand even this, but who simply talk any nonsense that comes to\r\ntheir tongues, and who do not remain definitely attached either to one\r\nsect or the other--such people are not even worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are these sects, and what are the logical consequences of\r\ntheir hypotheses?[71] The one class supposes that all substance which\r\nis subject to genesis and destruction is at once _continuous_[72] and\r\nsusceptible of _alteration_. The other school assumes substance to be\r\nunchangeable, unalterable, and sub-divided into fine particles, which\r\nare separated from one another by empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAll people, therefore, who can appreciate the logical sequence of an\r\nhypothesis hold that, according to the second teaching, there does not\r\nexist any substance or faculty peculiar either to Nature or to\r\nSoul,[73] but that these result from the way in which the primary\r\ncorpuscles,[74] which are unaffected by change, come together.\r\nAccording to the first-mentioned teaching, on the other hand, Nature\r\nis not posterior to the corpuscles, but is a long way prior to them\r\nand older than they; and therefore in their view it is Nature which\r\nputs together the bodies both of plants and animals; and this she does\r\nby virtue of certain faculties which she possesses--these being, on\r\nthe one hand, attractive and assimilative of what is appropriate, and,\r\non the other, expulsive of what is foreign. Further, she skilfully\r\nmoulds everything during the stage of genesis; and she also provides\r\nfor the creatures after birth, employing here other faculties again,\r\nnamely, one of affection and forethought for offspring, and one of\r\nsociability and friendship for kindred. According to the other school,\r\nnone of these things exist in the natures[75] [of living things], nor\r\nis there in the soul any original innate idea, whether of agreement or\r\ndifference, of separation or synthesis, of justice or injustice, of\r\nthe beautiful or ugly; all such things, they say, arise in us _from\r\nsensation and through sensation_, and animals are steered by certain\r\nimages and memories.\r\n\r\nSome of these people have even expressly declared that the soul\r\npossesses no reasoning faculty, but that we are led like cattle by the\r\nimpression of our senses, and are unable to refuse or dissent from\r\nanything. In their view, obviously, courage, wisdom, temperance, and\r\nself-control are all mere nonsense, we do not love either each other\r\nor our offspring, nor do the gods care anything for us. This school\r\nalso despises dreams, birds, omens, and the whole of astrology,\r\nsubjects with which we have dealt at greater length in another\r\nwork,[76] in which we discuss the views of Asclepiades the\r\nphysician.[77] Those who wish to do so may familiarize themselves with\r\nthese arguments, and they may also consider at this point which of the\r\ntwo roads lying before us is the better one to take. Hippocrates took\r\nthe first-mentioned. According to this teaching, substance is one and\r\nis subject to _alteration_; there is a consensus in the movements of\r\nair and fluid throughout the whole body;[78] Nature acts throughout in\r\nan artistic and equitable manner, having certain faculties, by virtue\r\nof which each part of the body draws to itself the juice which is\r\nproper to it, and, having done so, attaches it to every portion of\r\nitself, and completely assimilates it; while such part of the juice as\r\nhas not been mastered,[79] and is not capable of undergoing complete\r\nalteration and being assimilated to the part which is being nourished,\r\nis got rid of by yet another (an expulsive) faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      XII\r\n\r\n  Hoti men oun anankaion homoiôsin tin' einai tou\r\n  trephontos tô trephomenô tên threpsin, antikrys dêlon.\r\n  ou mên hyparchousan ge tautên tên homoiôsin, alla\r\n  phainomenên monon einai phasin hoi mête technikên\r\n  oiomenoi tên physin einai mête pronoêtikên tou zôou\r\n  mêth' holôs tinas oikeias echein dynameis, hais chrômenê\r\n  ta men alloioi, ta d' helkei, || ta d' ekkrinei.               27\r\n\r\n  Kai hautai dyo gegonasin haireseis kata genos en iatrikê\r\n  te kai philosophia tôn apophênamenôn ti peri physeôs\r\n  andrôn, hosoi g' autôn gignôskousin, ho ti legousi, kai\r\n  tên akolouthian hôn hypethento theôrousi th' hama kai\r\n  diaphylattousin. hosoi de mêd' auto touto syniasin, all'\r\n  haplôs, ho ti an epi glôttan elthê, lêrousin, en\r\n  oudetera tôn haireseôn akribôs katamenontes, oude\r\n  memnêsthai tôn toioutôn prosêkei.\r\n\r\n  Tines oun hai dyo haireseis hautai kai tis hê tôn en\r\n  autais hypotheseôn akolouthia?

But, even\r\nleaving the butchers aside, all people who suffer either from frequent\r\ndysuria or from retention of urine call themselves \"nephritics,\"[84]\r\nwhen they feel pain in the loins and pass sandy matter in their water.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose that Asclepiades ever saw a stone which had been\r\npassed by one of these sufferers, or observed that this was preceded\r\nby a sharp pain in the region between kidneys and bladder as the stone\r\ntraversed the ureter, or that, when the stone was passed, both the\r\npain and the retention at once ceased. It is worth while, then,\r\nlearning how his theory accounts for the presence of urine in the\r\nbladder, and one is forced to marvel at the ingenuity of a man who\r\nputs aside these broad, clearly visible routes,[85] and postulates\r\nothers which are narrow, invisible--indeed, entirely imperceptible.\r\nHis view, in fact, is that the fluid which we drink passes into the\r\nbladder by being resolved into vapours, and that, when these have been\r\nagain condensed, it thus regains its previous form, and turns from\r\nvapour into fluid. He simply looks upon the bladder as a sponge or a\r\npiece of wool, and not as the perfectly compact and impervious body\r\nthat it is, with two very strong coats. For if we say that the vapours\r\npass through these coats, why should they not pass through the\r\nperitoneum[86] and the diaphragm, thus filling the whole abdominal\r\ncavity and thorax with water? \"But,\" says he, \"of course the\r\nperitoneal coat is more impervious than the bladder, and this is why\r\nit keeps out the vapours, while the bladder admits them.\" Yet if he\r\nhad ever practised anatomy, he might have known that the outer coat of\r\nthe bladder springs from the peritoneum and is essentially the same as\r\nit, and that the inner coat, which is peculiar to the bladder, is more\r\nthan twice as thick as the former.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, it is not the thickness or thinness of the coats,\r\nbut the _situation_ of the bladder, which is the reason for the\r\nvapours being carried into it? On the contrary, even if it were\r\nprobable for every other reason that the vapours accumulate there, yet\r\nthe situation of the bladder would be enough in itself to prevent\r\nthis. For the bladder is situated below, whereas vapours have a\r\nnatural tendency to rise upwards; thus they would fill all the region\r\nof the thorax and lungs long before they came to the bladder.\r\n\r\nBut why do I mention the situation of the bladder, peritoneum, and\r\nthorax? For surely, when the vapours have passed through the coats of\r\nthe stomach and intestines, it is in the space between these and the\r\nperitoneum[87] that they will collect and become liquefied (just as in\r\ndropsical subjects it is in this region that most of the water\r\ngathers).[88] Otherwise the vapours must necessarily pass straight\r\nforward through everything which in any way comes in contact with\r\nthem, and will never come to a standstill. But, if this be assumed,\r\nthen they will traverse not merely the peritoneum but also the\r\nepigastrium, and will become dispersed into the surrounding air;\r\notherwise they will certainly collect under the skin.\r\n\r\nEven these considerations, however, our present-day Asclepiadeans\r\nattempt to answer, despite the fact that they always get soundly\r\nlaughed at by all who happen to be present at their disputations on\r\nthese subjects--so difficult an evil to get rid of is this sectarian\r\npartizanship, so excessively resistant to all cleansing processes,\r\nharder to heal than any itch!\r\n\r\nThus, one of our Sophists who is a thoroughly hardened disputer and as\r\nskilful a master of language as there ever was, once got into a\r\ndiscussion with me on this subject; so far from being put out of\r\ncountenance by any of the above-mentioned considerations, he even\r\nexpressed his surprise that I should try to overturn obvious facts by\r\nridiculous arguments! \"For,\" said he, \"one may clearly observe any day\r\nin the case of any bladder, that, if one fills it with water or air\r\nand then ties up its neck and squeezes it all round, it does not let\r\nanything out at any point, but accurately retains all its contents.\r\nAnd surely,\" said he, \"if there were any large and perceptible\r\nchannels coming into it from the kidneys the liquid would run out\r\nthrough these when the bladder was squeezed, in the same way that it\r\nentered?\"[89] Having abruptly made these and similar remarks in\r\nprecise and clear tones, he concluded by jumping up and\r\ndeparting--leaving me as though I were quite incapable of finding any\r\nplausible answer!\r\n\r\nThe fact is that those who are enslaved to their sects are not merely\r\ndevoid of all sound knowledge, but they will not even stop to learn!\r\nInstead of listening, as they ought, to the reason why liquid can\r\nenter the bladder through the ureters, but is unable to go back again\r\nthe same way,--instead of admiring Nature's artistic skill[90]--they\r\nrefuse to learn; they even go so far as to scoff, and maintain that\r\nthe kidneys, as well as many other things, have been made by Nature\r\n_for no purpose!_[91] And some of them who had allowed themselves to\r\nbe shown the ureters coming from the kidneys and becoming implanted in\r\nthe bladder, even had the audacity to say that these also existed for\r\nno purpose; and others said that they were spermatic ducts, and that\r\nthis was why they were inserted into the neck of the bladder and not\r\ninto its cavity. When, therefore, we had demonstrated to them the real\r\nspermatic ducts[92] entering the neck of the bladder lower down than\r\nthe ureters, we supposed that, if we had not done so before, we would\r\nnow at least draw them away from their false assumptions, and convert\r\nthem forthwith to the opposite view. But even this they presumed to\r\ndispute, and said that it was not to be wondered at that the semen\r\nshould remain longer in these latter ducts, these being more\r\nconstricted, and that it should flow quickly down the ducts which came\r\nfrom the kidneys, seeing that these were well dilated. We were,\r\ntherefore, further compelled to show them in a still living animal,\r\nthe urine plainly running out through the ureters into the bladder;\r\neven thus we hardly hoped to check their nonsensical talk.\r\n\r\nNow the method of demonstration is as follows. One has to divide the\r\nperitoneum in front of the ureters, then secure these with ligatures,\r\nand next, having bandaged up the animal, let him go (for he will not\r\ncontinue to urinate). After this one loosens the external bandages and\r\nshows the bladder empty and the ureters quite full and distended--in\r\nfact almost on the point of rupturing; on removing the ligature from\r\nthem, one then plainly sees the bladder becoming filled with urine.\r\n\r\nWhen this has been made quite clear, then, before the animal urinates,\r\none has to tie a ligature round his penis and then to squeeze the\r\nbladder all over; still nothing goes back through the ureters to the\r\nkidneys. Here, then, it becomes obvious that not only in a dead\r\nanimal, but in one which is still living, the ureters are prevented\r\nfrom receiving back the urine from the bladder. These observations\r\nhaving been made, one now loosens the ligature from the animal's penis\r\nand allows him to urinate, then again ligatures one of the ureters and\r\nleaves the other to discharge into the bladder. Allowing, then, some\r\ntime to elapse, one now demonstrates that the ureter which was\r\nligatured is obviously full and distended on the side next to the\r\nkidneys, while the other one--that from which the ligature had been\r\ntaken--is itself flaccid, but has filled the bladder with urine. Then,\r\nagain, one must divide the full ureter, and demonstrate how the urine\r\nspurts out of it, like blood in the operation of venesection; and\r\nafter this one cuts through the other also, and both being thus\r\ndivided, one bandages up the animal externally. Then when enough time\r\nseems to have elapsed, one takes off the bandages; the bladder will\r\nnow be found empty, and the whole region between the intestines and\r\nthe peritoneum full of urine, as if the animal were suffering from\r\ndropsy. Now, if anyone will but test this for himself on an animal, I\r\nthink he will strongly condemn the rashness of Asclepiades, and if he\r\nalso learns the reason why nothing regurgitates from the bladder into\r\nthe ureters, I think he will be persuaded by this also of the\r\nforethought and art shown by Nature in relation to animals.[93]\r\n\r\nNow Hippocrates, who was the first known to us of all those who have\r\nbeen both physicians and philosophers inasmuch as he was the first to\r\nrecognize what Nature effects, expresses his admiration of her, and is\r\nconstantly singing her praises and calling her \"just.\" Alone, he says,\r\nshe suffices for the animal in every respect, performing of her own\r\naccord and without any teaching all that is required. Being such, she\r\nhas, as he supposes, certain _faculties_, one attractive of what is\r\nappropriate,[94] and another eliminative of what is foreign, and she\r\nnourishes the animal, makes it grow, and expels its diseases by\r\ncrisis.[95] Therefore he says that there is in our bodies a\r\nconcordance in the movements of air and fluid, and that everything is\r\nin sympathy. According to Asclepiades, however, nothing is naturally\r\nin sympathy with anything else, all substance being divided and broken\r\nup into inharmonious elements and absurd \"molecules.\" Necessarily,\r\nthen, besides making countless other statements in opposition to plain\r\nfact, he was ignorant of Nature's faculties, both that attracting what\r\nis appropriate, and that expelling what is foreign. Thus he invented\r\nsome wretched nonsense to explain blood-production and _anadosis_,[96]\r\nand, being utterly unable to find anything to say regarding the\r\nclearing-out[97] of superfluities, he did not hesitate to join issue\r\nwith obvious facts, and, in this matter of urinary secretion, to\r\ndeprive both the kidneys and the ureters of their activity, by\r\nassuming that there were certain invisible channels opening into the\r\nbladder. It was, of course, a grand and impressive thing to do, to\r\nmistrust the obvious, and to pin one's faith in things which could not\r\nbe seen!\r\n\r\nAlso, in the matter of the yellow bile, he makes an even grander and\r\nmore spirited venture; for he says this is actually generated in the\r\nbile-ducts, not merely separated out.\r\n\r\nHow comes it, then, that in cases of jaundice two things happen at the\r\nsame time--that the dejections contain absolutely no bile, and that\r\nthe whole body becomes full of it? He is forced here again to talk\r\nnonsense, just as he did in regard to the urine. He also talks no less\r\nnonsense about the black bile and the spleen, not understanding what\r\nwas said by Hippocrates; and he attempts in stupid--I might say\r\ninsane--language, to contradict what he knows nothing about.\r\n\r\nAnd what profit did he derive from these opinions from the point of\r\nview of treatment? He neither was able to cure a kidney ailment, nor\r\njaundice, nor a disease of black bile, nor would he agree with the\r\nview held not merely by Hippocrates but by all men regarding\r\ndrugs--that some of them purge away yellow bile, and others black,\r\nsome again phlegm, and others the thin and watery superfluity[98]; he\r\nheld that all the substances evacuated[99] were _produced by the drugs\r\nthemselves_, just as yellow bile is produced by the biliary passages!\r\nIt matters nothing, according to this extraordinary man, whether we\r\ngive a hydragogue or a cholagogue in a case of dropsy, for these all\r\nequally purge[99] and dissolve the body, and produce a solution having\r\nsuch and such an appearance, which did not exist as such before![100]\r\n\r\nMust we not, therefore, suppose he was either mad, or entirely\r\nunacquainted with practical medicine? For who does not know that if a\r\ndrug for attracting phlegm be given in a case of jaundice it will not\r\neven evacuate four _cyathi_[101] of phlegm? Similarly also if one of\r\nthe hydragogues be given. A cholagogue, on the other hand, clears away\r\na great quantity of bile, and the skin of patients so treated at once\r\nbecomes clear. I myself have, in many cases, after treating the liver\r\ncondition, then removed the disease by means of a single purgation;\r\nwhereas, if one had employed a drug for removing phlegm one would have\r\ndone no good.\r\n\r\nNor is Hippocrates the only one who knows this to be so, whilst those\r\nwho take experience alone as their starting-point[102] know otherwise;\r\nthey, as well as all physicians who are engaged in the practice of\r\nmedicine, are of this opinion. Asclepiades, however is an exception;\r\nhe would hold it a betrayal of his assumed \"elements\"[103] to confess\r\nthe truth about such matters. For if a single drug were to be\r\ndiscovered which attracted such and such a humour only, there would\r\nobviously be danger of the opinion gaining ground that there is in\r\nevery body[104] a faculty which attracts its own particular quality.\r\nHe therefore says that safflower,[105] the Cnidian berry,[106] and\r\n_Hippophaes_,[107] do not draw phlegm from the body, but actually make\r\nit. Moreover, he holds that the flower and scales of bronze, and burnt\r\nbronze itself, and germander,[108] and wild mastich[109] dissolve the\r\nbody into water, and that dropsical patients derive benefit from these\r\nsubstances, not because they are purged by them, but because they are\r\nrid of substances which actually help to increase the disease; for, if\r\nthe medicine does not evacuate[110] the dropsical fluid contained in\r\nthe body, but generates it, it aggravates the condition further.\r\nMoreover, scammony, according to the Asclepiadean argument, not only\r\nfails to evacuate[110] the bile from the bodies of jaundiced subjects,\r\nbut actually turns the useful blood into bile, and dissolves the body;\r\nin fact it does all manner of evil and increases the disease.\r\n\r\nAnd yet this drug may be clearly seen to do good to numbers of people!\r\n\"Yes,\" says he, \"they derive benefit certainly, but merely in\r\nproportion to the evacuation.\" ... But if you give these cases a drug\r\nwhich draws off phlegm they will not be benefited. This is so obvious\r\nthat even those who make experience alone their starting-point[111]\r\nare aware of it; and these people make it a cardinal point of their\r\nteaching to trust to no arguments, but only to what can be clearly\r\nseen. In this, then, they show good sense; whereas Asclepiades goes\r\nfar astray in bidding us distrust our senses where obvious facts\r\nplainly overturn his hypotheses. Much better would it have been for\r\nhim not to assail obvious facts, but rather to devote himself entirely\r\nto these.\r\n\r\nIs it, then, these facts only which are plainly irreconcilable with\r\nthe views of Asclepiades? Is not also the fact that in summer yellow\r\nbile is evacuated in greater quantity by the same drugs, and in winter\r\nphlegm, and that in a young man more bile is evacuated, and in an old\r\nman more phlegm? Obviously each drug attracts something which already\r\nexists, and does not generate something previously non-existent. Thus\r\nif you give in the summer season a drug which attracts phlegm to a\r\nyoung man of a lean and warm habit, who has lived neither idly nor too\r\nluxuriously, you will with great difficulty evacuate a very small\r\nquantity of this humour, and you will do the man the utmost harm. On\r\nthe other hand, if you give him a cholagogue, you will produce an\r\nabundant evacuation and not injure him at all.\r\n\r\nDo we still, then, disbelieve that each drug attracts _that humour\r\nwhich is proper to it_?[112] Possibly the adherents of Asclepiades\r\nwill assent to this--or rather, they will--not possibly, but\r\ncertainly--declare that they disbelieve it, lest they should betray\r\ntheir darling prejudices.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     XIII\r\n\r\n  Mathein d' enestin ou monon ex hôn hoi tanantia\r\n  tithemenoi diapherontai tois enargôs phainomenois, eis\r\n

                 XIV\r\n\r\nLet us pass on, then, again to another piece of nonsense; for the\r\nsophists do not allow one to engage in enquiries that are of any\r\nworth, albeit there are many such; they compel one to spend one's time\r\nin dissipating the fallacious arguments which they bring forward.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is this piece of nonsense? It has to do with the famous\r\nand far-renowned stone which draws iron [the lodestone]. It might be\r\nthought that this would draw[113] their minds to a belief that there\r\nare in all bodies certain _faculties_ by which they attract their own\r\nproper qualities.\r\n\r\nNow Epicurus, despite the fact that he employs in his _Physics_[114]\r\nelements similar to those of Asclepiades,[115] yet allows that iron is\r\nattracted by the lodestone,[116] and chaff by amber. He even tries to\r\ngive the cause of the phenomenon. His view is that the atoms which\r\nflow from the stone are related in shape to those flowing from the\r\niron, and so they become easily interlocked with one another; thus it\r\nis that, after colliding with each of the two compact masses (the\r\nstone and the iron) they then rebound into the middle and so become\r\nentangled with each other, and draw the iron after them. So far, then,\r\nas his hypotheses regarding causation[117] go, he is perfectly\r\nunconvincing; nevertheless, he does grant that there is an attraction.\r\nFurther, he says that it is on similar principles that there occur in\r\nthe bodies of animals the dispersal of nutriment[118] and the\r\ndischarge of waste matters, as also the actions of cathartic drugs.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades, however, who viewed with suspicion the incredible\r\ncharacter of the cause mentioned, and who saw no other credible cause\r\non the basis of his supposed elements, shamelessly had recourse to the\r\nstatement that nothing is in any way attracted by anything else. Now,\r\nif he was dissatisfied with what Epicurus said, and had nothing better\r\nto say himself, he ought to have refrained from making hypotheses, and\r\nshould have said that Nature is a constructive artist and that the\r\nsubstance of things is always tending towards unity and also towards\r\nalteration because its own parts act upon and are acted upon by one\r\nanother.[119] For, if he had assumed this, it would not have been\r\ndifficult to allow that this constructive nature has powers which\r\nattract appropriate and expel alien matter. For in no other way could\r\nshe be constructive, preservative of the animal, and eliminative of\r\nits diseases,[120] unless it be allowed that she conserves what is\r\nappropriate and discharges what is foreign.\r\n\r\nBut in this matter, too, Asclepiades realized the logical sequence of\r\nthe principles he had assumed; he showed no scruples, however, in\r\nopposing plain fact; he joins issue in this matter also, not merely\r\nwith all physicians, but with everyone else, and maintains that there\r\nis no such thing as a crisis, or critical day,[121] and that Nature\r\ndoes absolutely nothing for the preservation of the animal. For his\r\nconstant aim is to follow out logical consequences and to upset\r\nobvious fact, in this respect being opposed to Epicurus; for the\r\nlatter always stated the observed fact, although he gives an\r\nineffective explanation of it. For, that these small corpuscles\r\nbelonging to the lodestone rebound, and become entangled with other\r\nsimilar particles of the iron, and that then, by means of this\r\nentanglement (which cannot be seen anywhere) such a heavy substance as\r\niron is attracted--I fail to understand how anybody could believe\r\nthis. Even if we admit this, the same principle will not explain the\r\nfact that, when the iron has another piece brought in contact with it,\r\nthis becomes attached to it.\r\n\r\nFor what are we to say? That, forsooth, some of the particles that\r\nflow from the lodestone collide with the iron and then rebound back,\r\nand that it is by these that the iron becomes suspended? that others\r\npenetrate into it, and rapidly pass through it by way of its empty\r\nchannels?[122] that these then collide with the second piece of iron\r\nand are not able to penetrate it although they penetrated the first\r\npiece? and that they then course back to the first piece, and produce\r\nentanglements like the former ones?\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis here becomes clearly refuted by its absurdity. As a\r\nmatter of fact, I have seen five writing-stylets of iron attached to\r\none another in a line, only the first one being in contact with the\r\nlodestone, and the power[123] being transmitted through it to the\r\nothers. Moreover, it cannot be said that if you bring a second stylet\r\ninto contact with the lower end of the first, it becomes held,\r\nattached, and suspended, whereas, if you apply it to any other part of\r\nthe side it does not become attached. For the power of the lodestone\r\nis distributed in all directions; it merely needs to be in contact\r\nwith the first stylet at any point; from this stylet again the power\r\nflows, as quick as a thought, all through the second, and from that\r\nagain to the third. Now, if you imagine a small lodestone hanging in a\r\nhouse, and in contact with it all round a large number of pieces of\r\niron, from them again others, from these others, and so on,--all these\r\npieces of iron must surely become filled with the corpuscles which\r\nemanate from the stone; therefore, this first little stone is likely\r\nto become dissipated by disintegrating into these emanations.[124]\r\nFurther, even if there be no iron in contact with it, it still\r\ndisperses into the air, particularly if this be also warm.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" says Epicurus, \"but these corpuscles must be looked on as\r\nexceedingly small, so that some of them are a ten-thousandth part of\r\nthe size of the very smallest particles carried in the air.\" Then do\r\nyou venture to say that so great a weight of iron can be suspended by\r\nsuch small bodies? If each of them is a ten-thousandth part as large\r\nas the dust particles which are borne in the atmosphere, how big must\r\nwe suppose the hook-like extremities by which they interlock with each\r\nother[125] to be? For of course this is quite the smallest portion of\r\nthe whole particle.\r\n\r\nThen, again, when a small body becomes entangled with another small\r\nbody, or when a body in motion becomes entangled with another also in\r\nmotion, they do not rebound at once. For, further, there will of\r\ncourse be others which break in upon them from above, from below, from\r\nfront and rear, from right and left, and which shake and agitate them\r\nand never let them rest. Moreover, we must perforce suppose that each\r\nof these small bodies has a large number of these hook-like\r\nextremities. For by one it attaches itself to its neighbours, by\r\nanother--the topmost one--to the lodestone, and by the bottom one to\r\nthe iron. For if it were attached to the stone above and not\r\ninterlocked with the iron below, this would be of no use.[126] Thus,\r\nthe upper part of the superior extremity must hang from the lodestone,\r\nand the iron must be attached to the lower end of the inferior\r\nextremity; and, since they interlock with each other by their sides as\r\nwell, they must, of course, have hooks there too. Keep in mind also,\r\nabove everything, what small bodies these are which possess all these\r\ndifferent kinds of outgrowths. Still more, remember how, in order that\r\nthe second piece of iron may become attached to the first, the third\r\nto the second, and to that the fourth, these absurd little particles\r\nmust both penetrate the passages in the first piece of iron and at the\r\nsame time rebound from the piece coming next in the series, although\r\nthis second piece is naturally in every way similar to the first.\r\n\r\nSuch an hypothesis, once again, is certainly not lacking in audacity;\r\nin fact, to tell the truth, it is far more shameless than the previous\r\nones; according to it, when five similar pieces of iron are arranged\r\nin a line, the particles of the lodestone which easily traverse the\r\nfirst piece of iron rebound from the second, and do not pass readily\r\nthrough it in the same way. Indeed, it is nonsense, whichever\r\nalternative is adopted. For, if they do rebound, how then do they pass\r\nthrough into the third piece? And if they do not rebound, how does the\r\nsecond piece become suspended to the first? For Epicurus himself\r\nlooked on the rebound as the active agent in attraction.\r\n\r\nBut, as I have said, one is driven to talk nonsense whenever one gets\r\ninto discussion with such men. Having, therefore, given a concise and\r\nsummary statement of the matter, I wish to be done with it. For if one\r\ndiligently familiarizes oneself with the writings of Asclepiades, one\r\nwill see clearly their logical dependence on his first principles, but\r\nalso their disagreement with observed facts. Thus, Epicurus, in his\r\ndesire to adhere to the facts, cuts an awkward figure by aspiring to\r\nshow that these agree with his principles, whereas Asclepiades\r\nsafeguards the sequence of principles, but pays no attention to the\r\nobvious fact. Whoever, therefore, wishes to expose the absurdity of\r\ntheir hypotheses, must, if the argument be in answer to Asclepiades,\r\nkeep in mind his disagreement with observed fact; or if in answer to\r\nEpicurus, his discordance with his principles. Almost all the other\r\nsects depending on similar principles are now entirely extinct, while\r\nthese alone maintain a respectable existence still. Yet the tenets of\r\nAsclepiades have been unanswerably confuted by Menodotus the\r\nEmpiricist, who draws his attention to their opposition to phenomena\r\nand to each other; and, again, those of Epicurus have been confuted by\r\nAsclepiades, who adhered always to logical sequence, about which\r\nEpicurus evidently cares little.\r\n\r\nNow people of the present day do not begin by getting a clear\r\ncomprehension of these sects, as well as of the better ones,\r\nthereafter devoting a long time to judging and testing the true and\r\nfalse in each of them; despite their ignorance, they style themselves,\r\nsome \"physicians\" and others \"philosophers.\" No wonder, then, that\r\nthey honour the false equally with the true. For everyone becomes like\r\nthe first teacher that he comes across, without waiting to learn\r\nanything from anybody else. And there are some of them, who, even if\r\nthey meet with more than one teacher, are yet so unintelligent and\r\nslow-witted that even by the time they have reached old age they are\r\nstill incapable of understanding the steps of an argument.... In the\r\nold days such people used to be set to menial tasks.... What will be\r\nthe end of it God knows!\r\n\r\nNow, we usually refrain from arguing with people whose principles are\r\nwrong from the outset. Still, having been compelled by the natural\r\ncourse of events to enter into some kind of a discussion with them, we\r\nmust add this further to what was said--that it is not only cathartic\r\ndrugs which naturally attract their special qualities,[127] but also\r\nthose which remove thorns and the points of arrows such as sometimes\r\nbecome deeply embedded in the flesh. Those drugs also which draw out\r\nanimal poisons or poisons applied to arrows all show the same faculty\r\nas does the lodestone. Thus, I myself have seen a thorn which was\r\nembedded in a young man's foot fail to come out when we exerted\r\nforcible traction with our fingers, and yet come away painlessly and\r\nrapidly on the application of a medicament. Yet even to this some\r\npeople will object, asserting that when the inflammation is dispersed\r\nfrom the part the thorn comes away of itself, without being pulled out\r\nby anything. But these people seem, in the first place, to be unaware\r\nthat there are certain drugs for drawing out inflammation and\r\ndifferent ones for drawing out embedded substances; and surely if it\r\nwas on the cessation of an inflammation that the abnormal matters were\r\nexpelled, then all drugs which disperse inflammations ought, _ipso\r\nfacto_, to possess the power of extracting these substances as\r\nwell.[128]\r\n\r\nAnd secondly, these people seem to be unaware of a still more\r\nsurprising fact, namely, that not merely do certain medicaments draw\r\nout thorns and others poisons, but that of the latter there are some\r\nwhich attract the poison of the viper, others that of the\r\nsting-ray,[129] and others that of some other animal; we can, in fact,\r\nplainly observe these poisons deposited on the medicaments. Here,\r\nthen, we must praise Epicurus for the respect he shows towards obvious\r\nfacts, but find fault with his views as to causation. For how can it\r\nbe otherwise than extremely foolish to suppose that a thorn which we\r\nfailed to remove by digital traction could be drawn out by these\r\nminute particles?\r\n\r\nHave we now, therefore, convinced ourselves that everything which\r\nexists[130] possesses a faculty by which it attracts its proper\r\nquality, and that some things do this more, and some less?\r\n\r\nOr shall we also furnish our argument with the illustration afforded\r\nby _corn_?[131] For those who refuse to admit that anything is\r\nattracted by anything else, will, I imagine, be here proved more\r\nignorant regarding Nature than the very peasants. When, for my own\r\npart, I first learned of what happens, I was surprised, and felt\r\nanxious to see it with my own eyes. Afterwards, when experience also\r\nhad confirmed its truth, I sought long among the various sects for an\r\nexplanation, and, with the exception of that which gave the first\r\nplace to _attraction_, I could find none which even approached\r\nplausibility, all the others being ridiculous and obviously quite\r\nuntenable.\r\n\r\nWhat happens, then, is the following. When our peasants are bringing\r\ncorn from the country into the city in wagons, and wish to filch some\r\naway without being detected, they fill earthen jars with water and\r\nstand them among the corn; the corn then draws the moisture into\r\nitself through the jar and acquires additional bulk and weight, but\r\nthe fact is never detected by the onlookers unless someone who knew\r\nabout the trick before makes a more careful inspection. Yet, if you\r\ncare to set down the same vessel in the very hot sun, you will find\r\nthe daily loss to be very little indeed. Thus corn has a greater power\r\nthan extreme solar heat of drawing to itself the moisture in its\r\nneighbourhood.[132] Thus the theory that the water is carried towards\r\nthe rarefied part of the air surrounding us[133] (particularly when\r\nthat is distinctly warm) is utter nonsense; for although it is much\r\nmore rarefied there than it is amongst the corn, yet it does not take\r\nup a tenth part of the moisture which the corn does.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      XIV\r\n\r\n  Palin oun kai hêmeis eph' heteran metabômen adoleschian;\r\n  ou gar epitrepousin hoi sophistai tôn axiôn ti zêtêmatôn\r\n  procheirizesthai kaitoi pampollôn hyparchontôn, alla\r\n  katatribein anankazousi ton chronon eis tên tôn\r\n  sophismatôn, hôn proballousi, lysin.\r\n\r\n  Tis oun hê adoleschia?

Here\r\nlet us forget the absurdities of Asclepiades, and, in company with\r\nthose who are persuaded that the urine does pass through the kidneys,\r\nlet us consider what is the character of this function. For, most\r\nassuredly, either the urine is conveyed by its own motion to the\r\nkidneys, considering this the better course (as do we when we go off\r\nto market![134]), or, if this be impossible, then some other reason\r\nfor its conveyance must be found. What, then, is this? If we are not\r\ngoing to grant the kidneys a faculty for attracting this particular\r\nquality,[135] as Hippocrates held, we shall discover no other reason.\r\nFor, surely everyone sees that either the kidneys must attract the\r\nurine, or the veins must propel it--if, that is, it does not move of\r\nitself. But if the veins did exert a propulsive action when they\r\ncontract, they would squeeze out into the kidneys not merely the\r\nurine, but along with it the whole of the blood which they\r\ncontain.[136] And if this is impossible, as we shall show, the\r\nremaining explanation is that the kidneys do exert traction.\r\n\r\nAnd how is propulsion by the veins impossible? The situation of the\r\nkidneys is against it. They do not occupy a position beneath the\r\nhollow vein [vena cava] as does the sieve-like [ethmoid] passage in\r\nthe nose and palate in relation to the surplus matter from the\r\nbrain;[137] they are situated on both sides of it. Besides, if the\r\nkidneys are like sieves, and readily let the thinner serous\r\n[whey-like] portion through, and keep out the thicker portion, then\r\nthe whole of the blood contained in the vena cava must go to them,\r\njust as the whole of the wine is thrown into the filters. Further, the\r\nexample of milk being made into cheese will show clearly what I mean.\r\nFor this, too, although it is all thrown into the wicker strainers,\r\ndoes not all percolate through; such part of it as is too fine in\r\nproportion to the width of the meshes passes downwards, and this is\r\ncalled _whey_ [serum]; the remaining thick portion which is destined\r\nto become cheese cannot get down, since the pores of the strainers\r\nwill not admit it. Thus it is that, if the blood-serum has similarly\r\nto percolate through the kidneys, the whole of the blood must come to\r\nthem, and not merely one part of it.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the appearance as found on dissection?\r\n\r\nOne division of the vena cava is carried upwards[138] to the heart,\r\nand the other mounts upon the spine and extends along its whole length\r\nas far as the legs; thus one division does not even come near the\r\nkidneys, while the other approaches them but is certainly not inserted\r\ninto them. Now, if the blood were destined to be purified by them as\r\nif they were sieves, the whole of it would have to fall into them, the\r\nthin part being thereafter conveyed downwards, and the thick part\r\nretained above. But, as a matter of fact, this is not so. For the\r\nkidneys lie on either side of the vena cava. They therefore do not act\r\nlike sieves, filtering fluid sent to them by the vena cava, and\r\nthemselves contributing no force. They obviously exert traction; for\r\nthis is the only remaining alternative.\r\n\r\n_How_, then, do they exert this traction? If, as Epicurus thinks, all\r\nattraction takes place by virtue of the _rebounds_ and _entanglements_\r\nof atoms, it would be certainly better to maintain that the kidneys\r\nhave no attractive action at all; for his theory, when examined, would\r\nbe found as it stands to be much more ridiculous even than the theory\r\nof the lodestone, mentioned a little while ago. Attraction occurs in\r\nthe way that Hippocrates laid down; this will be stated more clearly\r\nas the discussion proceeds; for the present our task is not to\r\ndemonstrate this, but to point out that no other cause of the\r\nsecretion of urine can be given except that of attraction by the\r\nkidneys,[139] and that this attraction does not take place in the way\r\nimagined by people who do not allow Nature a faculty of her own.[140]\r\n\r\nFor if it be granted that there is any attractive faculty at all in\r\nthose things which are governed by Nature,[141] a person who attempted\r\nto say anything else about the absorption of nutriment[142] would be\r\nconsidered a fool.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       XV\r\n\r\n  Epei d' hikanôs êdoleschêsamen ouch hekontes, all', hôs\r\n  hê paroimia phêsi, mainomenois anankasthentes\r\n  sym||manênai, palin epi tên tôn ourôn epanelthômen             57\r\n  diakrisin, en hê tôn men Asklêpiadou lêrôn\r\n  epilathômetha, meta de tôn pepeismenôn diêtheisthai ta\r\n  oura dia tôn nephrôn, tis ho tropos tês energeias estin,\r\n  episkepsômetha; pantôs gar ê ex hautôn epi tous nephrous\r\n  pheretai ta oura touto beltion einai nomizonta, kathaper\r\n  hêmeis, hopotan eis tên agoran apiômen; ê, ei tout'\r\n  adynaton, heteron ti chrê tês phoras autôn exeurein\r\n  aition. ti dê tout' estin?

Yet we\r\nshould have been satisfied if he had even merely written this:\r\n\"Hippocrates lies in saying 'The flesh[144] attracts both from the\r\nstomach and from without,' for it cannot attract either from the\r\nstomach or from without.\" Or if he had thought it worth while to state\r\nthat Hippocrates was wrong in criticizing the weakness of the neck of\r\nthe uterus, \"seeing that the orifice of the uterus has no power of\r\nattracting semen,\"[145] or if he [Erasistratus] had thought proper to\r\nwrite any other similar opinion, then we in our turn would have\r\ndefended ourselves in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"My good sir, do not run us down in this rhetorical fashion without\r\nsome proof; state some definite objection to our view, in order that\r\neither you may convince us by a brilliant refutation of the ancient\r\ndoctrine, or that, on the other hand, we may convert you from your\r\nignorance.\" Yet why do I say \"rhetorical\"? For we too are not to\r\nsuppose that when certain rhetoricians pour ridicule upon that which\r\nthey are quite incapable of refuting, without any attempt at argument,\r\ntheir words are really thereby constituted rhetoric. For rhetoric\r\nproceeds by persuasive reasoning; words without reasoning are\r\nbuffoonery rather than rhetoric. Therefore, the reply of Erasistratus\r\nin his treatise \"On Deglutition\" was neither rhetoric nor logic. For\r\nwhat is it that he says? \"Now, the stomach does not appear to exercise\r\nany traction.\" Let us testify against him in return, and set our\r\nargument beside his in the same form. _Now, there appears to be no\r\nperistalsis[146] of the gullet._ \"And how does this appear?\" one of\r\nhis adherents may perchance ask. \"For is it not indicative of\r\n_peristalsis_ that always when the upper parts of the gullet contract\r\nthe lower parts dilate?\" Again, then, we say, \"And in what way does\r\nthe attraction of the stomach not appear? For is it not indicative of\r\n_attraction_ that always when the lower parts of the gullet dilate the\r\nupper parts contract?\" Now, if he would but be sensible and recognize\r\nthat this phenomenon is not more indicative of the one than of the\r\nother view, but that it applies equally to both,[147] we should then\r\nshow him without further delay the proper way to the discovery of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nWe will, however, speak about the stomach again. And the dispersal of\r\nnutriment [anadosis] need not make us have recourse to the theory\r\nregarding the _natural tendency of a vacuum to become refilled_,[148]\r\nwhen once we have granted the attractive faculty of the kidneys. Now,\r\nalthough Erasistratus knew that this faculty most certainly existed,\r\nhe neither mentioned it nor denied it, nor did he make any statement\r\nas to his views on the secretion of urine.\r\n\r\nWhy did he give notice at the very beginning of his \"General\r\nPrinciples\" that he was going to speak about natural\r\nactivities--firstly what they are, how they take place, and in what\r\nsituations--and then, in the case of urinary secretion, declared that\r\nthis took place through the kidneys, but left out its method of\r\noccurrence? It must, then, have been for no purpose that he told us\r\nhow digestion occurs, or spends time upon the secretion of biliary\r\nsuperfluities;[149] for in these cases also it would have been\r\nsufficient to have named the parts through which the function takes\r\nplace, and to have omitted the method. On the contrary, in these cases\r\nhe was able to tell us not merely through what organs, but also in\r\nwhat way it occurs--as he also did, I think, in the case of\r\n_anadosis_; for he was not satisfied with saying that this took place\r\nthrough the veins, but he also considered fully the method, which he\r\nheld to be from the tendency of a vacuum to become refilled.\r\nConcerning the secretion of urine, however, he writes that this occurs\r\nthrough the kidneys, but does not add in what _way_ it occurs. I do\r\nnot think he could say that this was from the tendency of matter to\r\nfill a vacuum,[150] for, if this were so, nobody would have ever died\r\nof retention of urine, since no more can flow into a vacuum than has\r\nrun out. For, if no other factor comes into operation[151] save only\r\nthis tendency by which a vacuum becomes refilled, no more could ever\r\nflow in than had been evacuated. Nor could he suggest any other\r\nplausible cause, such, for example, as the expression of nutriment by\r\nthe stomach[152] which occurs in the process of anadosis; this had\r\nbeen entirely disproved in the case of blood in the vena cava;[153] it\r\nis excluded, not merely owing to the long distance, but also from the\r\nfact that the overlying heart, at each diastole, robs the vena cava by\r\nviolence of a considerable quantity of blood.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the lower part of the vena cava[154] there would still\r\nremain, solitary and abandoned, the specious theory concerning the\r\nfilling of a vacuum. This, however, is deprived of plausibility by the\r\nfact that people die of retention of urine, and also, no less, by the\r\nsituation of the kidneys. For, if the whole of the blood were carried\r\nto the kidneys, one might properly maintain that it all undergoes\r\npurification there. But, as a matter of fact, the whole of it does not\r\ngo to them, but only so much as can be contained in the veins going to\r\nthe kidneys;[155] this portion only, therefore, will be purified.\r\nFurther, the thin serous part of this will pass through the kidneys as\r\nif through a sieve, while the thick sanguineous portion remaining in\r\nthe veins will obstruct the blood flowing in from behind; this will\r\nfirst, therefore, have to run back to the vena cava, and so to empty\r\nthe veins going to the kidneys; these veins will no longer be able to\r\nconduct a second quantity of unpurified blood to the kidneys--occupied\r\nas they are by the blood which had preceded, there is no passage left.\r\nWhat power have we, then, which will draw back the purified blood from\r\nthe kidneys? And what power, in the next place, will bid this blood\r\nretire to the lower part of the vena cava, and will enjoin on another\r\nquantity coming from above not to proceed downwards before turning off\r\ninto the kidneys?\r\n\r\nNow Erasistratus realized that all these ideas were open to many\r\nobjections, and he could only find one idea which held good in all\r\nrespects--namely, that of _attraction_. Since, therefore, he did not\r\nwish either to get into difficulties or to mention the view of\r\nHippocrates, he deemed it better to say nothing at all as to the\r\nmanner in which secretion occurs.\r\n\r\nBut even if he kept silence, I am not going to do so. For I know that\r\nif one passes over the Hippocratic view and makes some other\r\npronouncement about the function of the kidneys, one cannot fail to\r\nmake oneself utterly ridiculous. It was for this reason that\r\nErasistratus kept silence and Asclepiades lied; they are like slaves\r\nwho have had plenty to say in the early part of their career, and have\r\nmanaged by excessive rascality to escape many and frequent\r\naccusations, but who, later, when caught in the act of thieving,\r\ncannot find any excuse; the more modest one then keeps silence, as\r\nthough thunderstruck, whilst the more shameless continues to hide the\r\nmissing article beneath his arm and denies on oath that he has ever\r\nseen it. For it was in this way also that Asclepiades, when all subtle\r\nexcuses had failed him and there was no longer any room for nonsense\r\nabout \"conveyance towards the rarefied part [of the air],\"[156] and\r\nwhen it was impossible without incurring the greatest derision to say\r\nthat this superfluity [_i.e._ the urine] is generated by the kidneys\r\nas is bile by the canals in the liver--he, then, I say, clearly lied\r\nwhen he swore that the urine does not reach the kidneys, and\r\nmaintained that it passes, in the form of vapour, straight from the\r\nregion of the vena cava,[157] to collect in the bladder.\r\n\r\nLike slaves, then, caught in the act of stealing, these two are quite\r\nbewildered, and while the one says nothing, the other indulges in\r\nshameless lying.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      XVI\r\n\r\n  Erasistratos d' ouk oid' hopôs heterais men tisi doxais\r\n  euêthesin anteipe dia makrôn, hyperebê de teleôs tên\r\n  Hippokratous, oud' achri tou mnêmoneusai monon autês,\r\n  hôs en tois peri kataposeôs epoiêsen, axiôsas. en\r\n  ekeinois men gar achri tosoutou phainetai mnêmoneuôn,\r\n  hôs tounom' eipein tês holkês monon hôde pôs graphôn;\r\n\r\n  \"Holkê men oun tês koilias oudemia phainetai einai\";\r\n  peri de tês || anadoseôs ton logon poioumenos oud' achri       61\r\n  syllabês mias emnêmoneuse tês Hippokrateiou doxês.\r\n  kaitoi g' epêrkesen an hêmin, ei kai tout' egrapse\r\n  monon, hôs Hippokratês eipôn \"Sarkes holkoi kai ek\r\n  koiliês kai exôthen\" pseudetai; oute gar ek tês koilias\r\n  out' exôthen helkein dynantai. ei de kai hoti mêtras\r\n  aitiômenos arrhôston auchena kakôs eipen \"Ou gar dynatai\r\n  auteês ho stomachos eirysai tên gonên,\" ê ei kai ti\r\n  toiouton allo graphein ho Erasistratos êxiôse, tot' an\r\n  kai hêmeis pros auton apologoumenoi eipomen;\r\n\r\n  Ô gennaie, mê rhêtorikôs hêmôn katatreche chôris\r\n  apodeixeôs, all' eipe tina katêgorian tou dogmatos, hin'\r\n  ê peisthômen soi hôs kalôs exelenchonti ton palaion\r\n  logon ê metapeisômen hôs agnoounta. kaitoi ti legô\r\n  rhêtorikôs?

As these slaves held that they had done nothing fine unless\r\nthey had cheated their master three times, so also the men I am\r\ndiscussing have taken their time over the construction of impudent\r\nsophisms, the one party striving to prevent the lies of Asclepiades\r\nfrom ever being refuted, and the other saying stupidly what\r\nErasistratus had the sense to keep silence about.\r\n\r\nBut enough about the Asclepiadeans. The Erasistrateans, in attempting\r\nto say how the kidneys let the urine through, will do anything or\r\nsuffer anything or try any shift in order to find some plausible\r\nexplanation which does not demand the principle of _attraction_.\r\n\r\nNow those near the times of Erasistratus maintain that the parts above\r\nthe kidneys receive pure blood, whilst the watery residue, being\r\nheavy, tends to run downwards; that this, after percolating through\r\nthe kidneys themselves, is thus rendered serviceable, and is sent, as\r\nblood, to all the parts below the kidneys.\r\n\r\nFor a certain period at least this view also found favour and\r\nflourished, and was held to be true; after a time, however, it became\r\nsuspect to the Erasistrateans themselves, and at last they abandoned\r\nit. For apparently the following two points were assumed, neither of\r\nwhich is conceded by anyone, nor is even capable of being proved. The\r\nfirst is the heaviness of the serous fluid, which was said to be\r\nproduced in the vena cava, and which did not exist, apparently, at the\r\nbeginning, when this fluid was being carried up from the stomach to\r\nthe liver. Why, then, did it not at once run downwards when it was in\r\nthese situations? And if the watery fluid is so heavy, what\r\nplausibility can anyone find in the statement that it assists in the\r\nprocess of _anadosis_?\r\n\r\nIn the second place there is this absurdity, that even if it be agreed\r\nthat all the watery fluid does fall downwards, and only when it is in\r\nthe vena cava,[158] still it is difficult, or, rather, impossible, to\r\nsay through what means it is going to fall into the kidneys, seeing\r\nthat these are not situated below, but on either side of the vena\r\ncava, and that the vena cava is not inserted into them, but merely\r\nsends a branch[159] into each of them, as it also does into all the\r\nother parts.\r\n\r\nWhat doctrine, then, took the place of this one when it was condemned?\r\nOne which to me seems far more foolish than the first, although it\r\nalso flourished at one time. For they say, that if oil be mixed with\r\nwater and poured upon the ground, each will take a different route,\r\nthe one flowing this way and the other that, and that, therefore, it\r\nis not surprising that the watery fluid runs into the kidneys, while\r\nthe blood falls downwards along the vena cava. Now this doctrine also\r\nstands already condemned. For why, of the countless veins which spring\r\nfrom the vena cava, should blood flow into all the others, and the\r\nserous fluid be diverted to those going to the kidneys? They have not\r\nanswered the question which was asked; they merely state what happens\r\nand imagine they have thereby assigned the reason.\r\n\r\nOnce again, then (the third cup to the Saviour!),[160] let us now\r\nspeak of the worst doctrine of all, lately invented by Lycus of\r\nMacedonia,[161] but which is popular owing to its novelty. This Lycus,\r\nthen, maintains, as though uttering an oracle from the inner\r\nsanctuary, that urine is _residual matter from the nutrition of the\r\nkidneys_![162] Now, the amount of urine passed every day shows clearly\r\nthat it is the whole of the fluid drunk which becomes urine, except\r\nfor that which comes away with the dejections or passes off as sweat\r\nor insensible perspiration. This is most easily recognized in winter\r\nin those who are doing no work but are carousing, especially if the\r\nwine be thin and diffusible; these people rapidly pass almost the same\r\nquantity as they drink. And that even Erasistratus was aware of this\r\nis known to those who have read the first book of his \"General\r\nPrinciples.\"[163] Thus Lycus is speaking neither good Erasistratism,\r\nnor good Asclepiadism, far less good Hippocratism. He is, therefore,\r\nas the saying is, like a white crow, which cannot mix with the genuine\r\ncrows owing to its colour, nor with the pigeons owing to its size. For\r\nall this, however, he is not to be disregarded; he may, perhaps, be\r\nstating some wonderful truth, unknown to any of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nNow it is agreed that all parts which are undergoing nutrition produce\r\na certain amount of residue, but it is neither agreed nor is it\r\nlikely, that the kidneys alone, small bodies as they are, could hold\r\nfour whole _congii_,[164] and sometimes even more, of residual matter.\r\nFor this surplus must necessarily be greater in quantity in each of\r\nthe larger viscera; thus, for example, that of the lung, if it\r\ncorresponds in amount to the size of the viscus, will obviously be\r\nmany times more than that in the kidneys, and thus the whole of the\r\nthorax will become filled, and the animal will be at once suffocated.\r\nBut if it be said that the residual matter is equal in amount in each\r\nof the other parts, where are the _bladders_, one may ask, through\r\nwhich it is excreted? For, if the kidneys produce in drinkers three\r\nand sometimes four _congii_ of superfluous matter, that of each of the\r\nother viscera will be much more, and thus an enormous barrel will be\r\nneeded to contain the waste products of them all. Yet one often\r\nurinates practically the same quantity as one has drunk, which would\r\nshow that the whole of what one drinks goes to the kidneys.\r\n\r\nThus the author of this third piece of trickery would appear to have\r\nachieved nothing, but to have been at once detected, and there still\r\nremains the original difficulty which was insoluble by Erasistratus\r\nand by all others except Hippocrates. I dwell purposely on this topic,\r\nknowing well that nobody else has anything to say about the function\r\nof the kidneys, but that either we must prove more foolish than the\r\nvery butchers[165] if we do not agree that the urine passes through\r\nthe kidneys; or, if one acknowledges this, that then one cannot\r\npossibly give any other reason for the secretion than the principle of\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nNow, if the movement of urine does not depend on the tendency of a\r\nvacuum to become refilled,[166] it is clear that neither does that of\r\nthe blood nor that of the bile; or if that of these latter does so,\r\nthen so also does that of the former. For they must all be\r\naccomplished in one and the same way, even according to Erasistratus\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThis matter, however, will be discussed more fully in the book\r\nfollowing this.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     XVII\r\n\r\n  Tôn de neôterôn hosoi tois toutôn onomasin heautous\r\n  esemnynan Erasistrateious te kai Asklêpiadeious\r\n  eponomasantes, homoiôs tois hypo tou beltistou Menandrou\r\n  kata tas kômôdias eisagomenois oiketais, Daois te tisi\r\n  kai Getais, ouden hêgoumenois sphisi peprachthai\r\n  gennaion, ei mê tris exapatêseian ton despotên, houtô\r\n  kai autoi kata pollên scholên anaischynta sophismata\r\n  synethesan, hoi men, hina mêd' holôs exelenchtheiê pot'\r\n  || Asklêpiadês pseudomenos, hoi d', hina kakôs eipôsin,        68\r\n  ha kalôs esiôpêsen Erasistratos.\r\n\r\n  Alla tôn men Asklêpiadeiôn halis. hoi d' Erasistrateioi\r\n  legein epicheirountes, hopôs hoi nephroi diêthousi to\r\n  ouron, hapanta drôsi te kai paschousi kai pantoioi\r\n  gignontai pithanon exeurein ti zêtountes aition holkês\r\n  mê deomenon.\r\n\r\n  Hoi men dê plêsion Erasistratou tois chronois genomenoi\r\n  ta men anô tôn nephrôn moria katharon haima lambanein\r\n  phasi, tô de baros echein to hydatôdes perittôma\r\n  brithein te kai hyporrhein katô; diêthoumenon d'\r\n  entautha kata tous nephrous autous chrêston houtô\r\n  genomenon hapasi tois katô tôn nephrôn epipempesthai to\r\n  haima.\r\n\r\n  Kai mechri ge tinos eudokimêsen hêde hê doxa kai êkmase\r\n  kai alêthês enomisthê; chronô d' hysteron kai autois\r\n  tois Erasistrateiois hypoptos ephanê kai teleutôntes\r\n  apestêsan autês. aiteisthai gar edokoun dyo tauta mête\r\n  synchôroumena pros tinos all' oud' apodeichthênai\r\n  dynamena, prôton men to baros tês orrhôdous hygrotêtos\r\n  en tê koilê || phlebi gennômenon, hôsper ouk ex archês         69\r\n  hyparchon, hopot' ek tês koilias eis hêpar anephereto.\r\n  ti dê oun ouk euthys en ekeinois tois chôriois hyperrhei\r\n  katô?

By that Galen practically means what\r\n    we would call the physiological or biological powers,\r\n    the characteristic faculties of the living organism; his\r\n    Physis is the subconscious vital principle of the animal\r\n    or plant. Like Aristotle, however, he also ascribes\r\n    quasi-vital properties to inanimate things, _cf._\r\n    Introduction, p. xxvii.\r\n\r\n    [6] _Ergon_, here rendered an _effect_, is literally a\r\n    _work_ or _deed_; strictly speaking, it is something\r\n    _done_, _completed_, as distinguished from _energeia_,\r\n    which is the actual _doing_, the _activity_ which\r\n    produces this _ergon_, _cf._ p. 13, and Introduction, p.\r\n    xxx.\r\n\r\n    [7] Gk. _psyche_, Lat. _anima_.\r\n\r\n    [8] Gk. _physis_, Lat. _natura_.\r\n\r\n    [9] _Motion_ (kinesis) is Aristotle's general term for\r\n    what we would rather call _change_. It includes various\r\n    kinds of change, as well as movement proper, _cf._\r\n    Introduction, p. xxix.\r\n\r\n    [10] \"Conveyance,\" \"transport,\" \"transit\"; purely\r\n    mechanical or passive motion, as distinguished from\r\n    _alteration_ (qualitative change).\r\n\r\n    [11] \"Waxing and waning,\" the latter literally\r\n    _phthisis_, a wasting or \"decline;\" _cf._ Scotch\r\n    _divining_, Dutch _verdwijnen_.\r\n\r\n    [12] Becoming and perishing: Latin, _generatio et\r\n    corruptio_.\r\n\r\n    [13] \"Ad substantiam productio seu ad formam processus\"\r\n    (Linacre).\r\n\r\n    [14] \"Preformationist\" doctrine of Anaxagoras. To him\r\n    the apparent alteration in qualities took place when a\r\n    number of minute pre-existing bodies, all bearing the\r\n    same quality, came together in sufficient numbers to\r\n    impress that quality on the senses. The factor which\r\n    united the minute quality-bearers was Nous. \"In the\r\n    beginning,\" says Anaxagoras, \"all things existed\r\n    together--then came Nous and brought them into order.\"\r\n\r\n    [15] \"De ea alteratione quae per totam fit substantiam\"\r\n    (Linacre).\r\n\r\n    [16] The systematizer of Stoicism and successor of Zeno.\r\n\r\n    [17] Note characteristic impatience with metaphysics. To\r\n    Galen, as to Hippocrates and Aristotle, it sufficed to\r\n    look on the qualitative differences apprehended by the\r\n    senses as fundamental. Zeno of Citium was the founder of\r\n    the Stoic school; on the further analysis by this school\r\n    of the _qualities_ into _bodies_ _cf._ p. 144, note 3\r\n    (203).\r\n\r\n    [18] A rallying-ground: lit. a place where two glens\r\n    meet.\r\n\r\n    [19] Thus according to Gomperz (_Greek Thinkers_), the\r\n    hypothesis of Anaxagoras was that \"the bread ... already\r\n    contained the countless forms of matter as such which\r\n    the human body displays. Their minuteness of size would\r\n    withdraw them from our perception. For the defect or\r\n    'weakness' of the senses is the narrowness of their\r\n    receptive area. These elusive particles are rendered\r\n    visible and tangible by the process of _nutrition_,\r\n    which combines them.\"\r\n\r\n    [20] Therefore the blood must have come from the bread.\r\n    The food from the alimentary canal was supposed by Galen\r\n    to be converted into blood in and by the portal veins,\r\n    _cf._ p. 17.\r\n\r\n    [21] By \"elements\" is meant all homogeneous, amorphous\r\n    substances, such as metals, &c., as well as the\r\n    elementary _tissues_.\r\n\r\n    [22] Work or product. Lat. _opus_. _cf._ p. 3, note 2\r\n    (6).\r\n\r\n    [23] Operation, activation, or functioning. Lat.\r\n    _actio_. _cf._ _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n    [24] _i.e._ a concomitant (secondary) or passive\r\n    affection. Galen is contrasting active and passive\r\n    \"motion.\" _cf._ p. 6, note 1 (10).\r\n\r\n    [25] As already indicated, there is no exact English\r\n    equivalent for the Greek term _physis_, which is a\r\n    principle immanent in the animal itself, whereas our\r\n    term \"Nature\" suggests something more transcendent; we\r\n    are forced often, however, to employ it in default of a\r\n    better word. _cf._ p. 2, note 1 (5).\r\n\r\n    [26] In Greek _anadosis_. This process includes two\r\n    stages: (1) transmission of food from alimentary canal\r\n    to liver (rather more than our \"absorption\"); (2)\r\n    further transmission from liver to tissues. _Anadosis_\r\n    is lit. a yielding-up, a \"delivery;\" it may sometimes be\r\n    rendered \"dispersal.\" \"Distribution\" (_diadosis_) is a\r\n    further stage; _cf._ p. 163, note 4 (230).\r\n\r\n    [27] _cf._ p. 9.\r\n\r\n    [28] Since heat and cold tend to cause diffusion and\r\n    condensation respectively.\r\n\r\n    [29] Lit. _haematopoietic_. _cf._ p. 11, note 3 (20).\r\n\r\n    [30] Lit. _peptic_.\r\n\r\n    [31] Lit. _sphygmic_.\r\n\r\n    [32] _Genesis_ corresponds to the intrauterine life, or\r\n    what we may call _embryogeny_. _Alteration_ here means\r\n    histogenesis or tissue-production; _shaping_ or\r\n    _moulding_ (in Greek _diaplasis_) means the ordering of\r\n    these tissues into organs (organogenesis).\r\n\r\n    [33] _cf._ p. 25, note 4 (49).\r\n\r\n    [34] Note inadequate analogy of semen with fertilised\r\n    seeds of plants (_i.e._ of gamete with zygote).

The observer is here called an _autoptes_ or\r\n    \"eye-witness.\" Our medical term _autopsy_ thus means\r\n    literally a _persona inspection_ of internal parts,\r\n    ordinarily hidden.\r\n\r\n    [40] _i.e._ \"alteration\" is the earlier of the two\r\n    stages which constitute embryogeny or \"genesis.\" _cf._\r\n    p. 18, note 1 (32).\r\n\r\n    [41] The terms Galen actually uses are: _ostopoietic_,\r\n    _neuropoietic_, _chondropoietic_.\r\n\r\n    [42] As we should say, _parenchyma_ (a term used by\r\n    Erasistratus).\r\n\r\n    [43] Those were all the elemental tissues that\r\n    Aristotle, for example, had recognized; other tissues\r\n    (_e.g._ flesh or muscle) he believed to be complexes of\r\n    these.\r\n\r\n    [44] Or _tunics_.\r\n\r\n    [45] _i.e._ tissues.\r\n\r\n    [46] As, for example, Aristotle had held; _cf._ p. 23,\r\n    note 3 (43).

Linacre often translated it\r\n    _conveniens_, and it may usually be rendered _proper_,\r\n    _peculiar_, _own special_, or _own particular_ in\r\n    English.

For when once there has been\r\ndemonstrated in any one organ, the drawing, or so-called\r\n_epispastic_[168] faculty, there is then no difficulty in transferring\r\nit to the rest. Certainly Nature did not give a power such as this to\r\nthe kidneys without giving it also to the vessels which abstract the\r\nbiliary fluid,[169] nor did she give it to the latter without also\r\ngiving it to each of the other parts. And, assuredly, if this is true,\r\nwe must marvel that Erasistratus should make statements concerning the\r\ndelivery of nutriment from the food-canal[170] which are so false as\r\nto be detected even by Asclepiades. Now, Erasistratus considers it\r\nabsolutely certain that, if anything flows from the veins, one of two\r\nthings must happen: either a completely empty space will result, or\r\nthe contiguous quantum of fluid will run in and take the place of that\r\nwhich has been evacuated. Asclepiades, however, holds that not one of\r\ntwo, but one of three things must be said to result in the emptied\r\nvessels: either there will be an entirely empty space, or the\r\ncontiguous portion will flow in, or the vessel will contract. For\r\nwhereas, in the case of reeds and tubes it is true to say that, if\r\nthese be submerged in water, and are emptied of the air which they\r\ncontain in their lumens, then either a completely empty space will be\r\nleft, or the contiguous portion will move onwards; in the case of\r\nveins this no longer holds, since their coats can collapse and so fall\r\nin upon the interior cavity. It may be seen, then, how false this\r\nhypothesis--by Zeus, I cannot call it a demonstration!--of\r\nErasistratus is.\r\n\r\nAnd, from another point of view, even if it were true, it is\r\nsuperfluous, if the stomach[171] has the power of compressing the\r\nveins, as he himself supposed, and the veins again of contracting upon\r\ntheir contents and propelling them forwards.[172] For, apart from\r\nother considerations, no _plethora_[173] would ever take place in the\r\nbody, if delivery of nutriment resulted merely from the tendency of a\r\nvacuum to become refilled. Now, if the compression of the stomach\r\nbecomes weaker the further it goes, and cannot reach to an indefinite\r\ndistance, and if, therefore, there is need of some other mechanism to\r\nexplain why the blood is conveyed in all directions, then the\r\nprinciple of the refilling of a vacuum may be looked on as a necessary\r\naddition;[174] there will not, however, be a plethora in any of the\r\nparts coming after the liver,[175] or, if there be, it will be in the\r\nregion of the heart and lungs; for the heart alone of the parts which\r\ncome after the liver draws the nutriment into its right ventricle,\r\nthereafter sending it through the _arterioid vein_[176] to the lungs\r\n(for Erasistratus himself will have it that, owing to the membranous\r\nexcrescences,[177] no other parts save the lungs receive nourishment\r\nfrom the heart). If, however, in order to explain how plethora comes\r\nabout, we suppose the force of compression by the stomach to persist\r\nindefinitely, we have no further need of the principle of the\r\nrefilling of a vacuum, especially if we assume contraction of the\r\nveins in addition--as is, again, agreeable to Erasistratus himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BOOK II\r\n\r\n                        B\r\n\r\n\r\n                        I\r\n\r\n  Hoti men oun anankaion estin ouk Erasistratô monon alla        74\r\n  kai tois allois hapasin, hosoi mellousi peri diakriseôs\r\n  ourôn erein ti chrêston, homologêsai dynamin tin'\r\n  hyparchein tois nephrois helkousan eis heautous poiotêta\r\n  toiautên, hoia en tois ourois esti, dia tou prosthen\r\n  epidedeiktai grammatos, anamimnêskontôn ham' autô kai\r\n  touth' hêmôn, hôs ouk allôs men eis tên kystin pheretai\r\n  ta oura dia tôn nephrôn, allôs d' eis hapanta tou zôou\r\n  ta moria to haima, kat' allon de tina tropon hê xanthê\r\n  cholê diakrinetai. deichtheisês gar enargôs eph' henos\r\n  || houtinosoun organou tês helktikês te kai epispastikês       75\r\n  onomazomenês dynameôs ouden eti chalepon epi ta loipa\r\n  metapherein autên; ou gar dê tois men nephrois hê physis\r\n  edôke tina toiautên dynamin, ouchi de ge kai tois to\r\n  cholôdes hygron helkousin angeiois oude toutois men,\r\n  ouketi de kai tôn allôn moriôn hekastô. kai mên ei tout'\r\n  alêthes esti, thaumazein chrê tou Erasistratou pseudeis\r\n  houtô logous hyper anadoseôs trophês eipontos, hôs mêd'\r\n  Asklêpiadên lathein. kaitoi g' oietai pantos mallon\r\n  alêthes hyparchein, hôs, eiper ek tôn phlebôn aporrheoi\r\n  ti, dyoin thateron ê kenos estai topos athroôs ê to\r\n  syneches epirrhyêsetai tên basin anaplêroun tou\r\n  kenoumenou. all' ho g' Asklêpiadês ou dyoin thateron\r\n  phêsin, alla triôn hen ti chrênai legein epi tois\r\n  kenoumenois angeiois hepesthai ê kenon athroôs topon ê\r\n  to syneches akolouthêsein ê systalêsesthai to angeion.\r\n  epi men gar tôn kalamôn kai tôn auliskôn tôn eis to\r\n  hydôr kathiemenôn alêthes eipein, hoti kenoumenou tou\r\n  periechomenou kata tên || eurychôrian autôn aeros ê            76\r\n  kenos athroôs estai topos ê akolouthêsei to syneches;\r\n  epi de tôn phlebôn ouket' enchôrei, dynamenou dê tou\r\n  chitônos autôn eis heauton synizanein kai dia touto\r\n  katapiptein eis tên entos eurychôrian. houtô men dê\r\n  pseudês hê peri tês pros to kenoumenon akolouthias ouk\r\n  apodeixis ma Di' eipoim' an all' hypothesis\r\n  Erasistrateios.\r\n\r\n  Kath' heteron d' au tropon, ei kai alêthês eiê, perittê,\r\n  tês men koilias enthlibein tais phlepsi dynamenês, hôs\r\n  autos hypetheto, tôn phlebôn d' au peristellesthai tô\r\n  enyparchonti kai proôthein auto. ta te gar alla kai\r\n  plêthos ouk an en tô sômati genoito, tê pros to\r\n  kenoumenon akolouthia monê tês anadoseôs epiteloumenês.\r\n  ei men oun hê tês gastros enthlipsis eklyetai proïousa\r\n  kai mechri pantos adynatos estin exikneisthai kai dia\r\n  tout' allês tinos dei mêchanês eis tên pantê phoran tou\r\n  haimatos, anankaia men hê pros to kenoumenon akolouthia\r\n  prosexeurêtai; plêthos d' en oudeni tôn meth' hêpar\r\n  estai || moriôn, ê, eiper ara, peri tên kardian te kai         77\r\n  ton pneumona. monê gar hautê tôn meth' hêpar eis tên\r\n  dexian hautês koilian helkei tên trophên, eita dia tês\r\n  phlebos tês artêriôdous ekpempei tô pneumoni; tôn gar\r\n  allôn ouden oud' autos ho Erasistratos ek kardias\r\n  bouletai trephesthai dia tên tôn hymenôn epiphysin. ei\r\n  de g', hina plêthos genêtai, phylaxomen achri pantos tên\r\n  rhômên tês kata tên koilian enthlipseôs, ouden eti\r\n  deometha tês pros to kenoumenon akolouthias, malist' ei\r\n  kai tên tôn phlebôn synypothoimetha peristolên, hôs au\r\n  kai tout' autô palin areskei tô Erasistratô.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              II\r\n\r\nLet me draw his attention, then, once again, even if he does not wish\r\nit, to the kidneys, and let me state that these confute in the very\r\nclearest manner such people as object to the principle of\r\n_attraction_. Nobody has ever said anything plausible, nor, as we\r\npreviously showed, has anyone been able to discover, by any means,\r\nany other cause for the secretion of urine; we necessarily appear mad\r\nif we maintain that the urine passes into the kidneys in the form of\r\nvapour, and we certainly cut a poor figure when we talk about the\r\ntendency of a vacuum to become refilled;[178] this idea is foolish in\r\nthe case of blood, and impossible, nay, perfectly nonsensical, in the\r\ncase of the urine.[179]\r\n\r\nThis, then, is one blunder made by those who dissociate themselves\r\nfrom the principle of attraction. Another is that which they make\r\nabout the _secretion of yellow bile_. For in this case, too, it is not\r\na fact that when the blood runs past the mouths [stomata] of the\r\nbile-ducts there will be a thorough separation out [secretion] of\r\nbiliary waste-matter. \"Well,\" say they, \"let us suppose that it is not\r\nsecreted but carried with the blood all over the body.\" But, you\r\nsapient folk, Erasistratus himself supposed that Nature took thought\r\nfor the animals' future, and was workmanlike in her method; and at the\r\nsame time he maintained that the biliary fluid was useless in every\r\nway for the animals. Now these two things are incompatible. For how\r\ncould Nature be still looked on as exercising forethought for the\r\nanimal when she allowed a noxious humour such as this to be carried\r\noff and distributed with the blood?...\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a small matter. I shall again point out here the\r\ngreatest and most obvious error. For if the yellow bile adjusts itself\r\nto the narrower vessels and stomata, and the blood to the wider ones,\r\nfor no other reason than that blood is thicker and bile thinner, and\r\nthat the stomata of the veins are wider and those of the bile-ducts\r\nnarrower,[180] then it is clear that this watery and serous\r\nsuperfluity,[181] too, will run out into the bile-ducts quicker than\r\ndoes the bile, exactly in proportion as it is thinner than the bile!\r\nHow is it, then, that it does not run out? \"Because,\" it may be said,\r\n\"urine is thicker than bile!\" This was what one of our Erasistrateans\r\nventured to say, herein clearly disregarding the evidence of his\r\nsenses, although he had trusted these in the case of the bile and\r\nblood. For, if it be that we are to look on bile as thinner than blood\r\nbecause it runs more, then, since the serous residue[181] passes\r\nthrough fine linen or lint or a sieve more easily even than does bile,\r\nby these tokens bile must also be thicker than the watery fluid. For\r\nhere, again, there is no argument which will demonstrate that bile is\r\nthinner than the serous superfluities.\r\n\r\nBut when a man shamelessly goes on using circumlocutions, and never\r\nacknowledges when he has had a fall, he is like the amateur wrestlers,\r\nwho, when they have been overthrown by the experts and are lying on\r\ntheir backs on the ground, so far from recognizing their fall,\r\nactually seize their victorious adversaries by the necks and prevent\r\nthem from getting away, thus supposing themselves to be the winners!\r\n\r\n\r\n                       II\r\n\r\n  Anamnêsteon oun authis auton, kan mê boulêtai, tôn\r\n  nephrôn kai lekteon, hôs elenchos houtoi phanerôtatos\r\n  hapantôn tôn apochôrountôn tês holkês; oudeis gar ouden\r\n  out' eipe pithanon, all' oud' exeurein eiche kat' oudena\r\n  tropon, hôs emprosthen edeiknymen, heteron aition ourôn\r\n  diakriseôs, all' anankaion ê mainesthai dokein, ei\r\n  phêsaimen atmoei||dôs eis tên kystin ienai to ouron ê          78\r\n  aschêmonein tês pros to kenoumenon akolouthias\r\n  mnêmoneuontas, lêrôdous men ousês kapi tou haimatos,\r\n  adynatou de kai êlithiou pantapasin epi tôn ourôn.\r\n\r\n  Hen men dê touto sphalma tôn apostantôn tês holkês;\r\n  heteron de to peri tês kata tên xanthên cholên\r\n  diakriseôs. oude gar oud' ekei pararrheontos tou\r\n  haimatos ta stomata tôn cholêdochôn angeiôn akribôs\r\n  diakrithêsetai to cholôdes perittôma. kai mê\r\n  diakrinesthô, phasin, alla synanapheresthô tô haimati\r\n  pantê tou sômatos. all', ô sophôtatoi, pronoêtikên tou\r\n  zôou kai technikên autos ho Erasistratos hypetheto tên\r\n  physin. alla kai to cholôdes hygron achrêston einai\r\n  pantapasi tois zôois ephasken. ou symbainei d' allêlois\r\n  amphô tauta. pôs gar an eti pronoeisthai tou zôou\r\n  doxeien epitrepousa synanapheresthai tô haimati\r\n  mochthêron houtô chymon?\r\n\r\n  Alla tauta men smikra; to de megiston kai saphestaton\r\n  palin entauth' hamartêma kai dê phrasô. eiper gar di'\r\n  ouden all' ê hoti pachyteron men esti to haima,\r\n  leptotera d' hê || xanthê cholê kai ta men tôn phlebôn         79\r\n  eurytera stomata, ta de tôn cholêdochôn angeiôn\r\n  stenotera, dia touth' hê men cholê tois stenoterois\r\n  angeiois te kai stomasin enarmottei, to d' haima tois\r\n  euryterois, dêlon, hôs kai to hydatôdes touto kai\r\n  orrhôdes perittôma tosoutô proteron eisryêsetai tois\r\n  cholêdochois angeiois, hosô leptoteron esti tês cholês.\r\n  pôs oun ouk eisrei? hoti pachyteron esti nê Dia to ouron\r\n  tês cholês; touto gar etolmêse tis eipein tôn kath'\r\n  hêmas Erasistrateiôn apostas dêlonoti tôn aisthêseôn,\r\n  hais episteusen epi te tês cholês kai tou haimatos. eite\r\n  gar hoti mallon hê cholê tou haimatos rhei, dia touto\r\n  leptoteran autên hêmin esti nomisteon, eith' hoti di'\r\n  othonês ê rhakous ê tinos êthmou rhaon diexerchetai kai\r\n  tautês to orrhôdes perittôma, kata tauta ta gnôrismata\r\n  pachytera tês hydatôdous hygrotêtos kai hautê genêsetai.\r\n  palin gar oud' entautha logos oudeis estin, hos\r\n  apodeixei leptoteran tên cholên tôn orrhôdôn\r\n  perittômatôn.\r\n\r\n  All' hotan tis anaischyntê periplekôn te kai mêpô\r\n  katapeptôkenai synchôrôn, || homoios estai tois idiôtais       80\r\n  tôn palaistôn, hoi katablêthentes hypo tôn palaistrikôn\r\n  kai kata tês gês hyptioi keimenoi tosoutou deousi to\r\n  ptôma gnôrizein, hôste kai kratousi tôn auchenôn autous\r\n  tous katabalontas ouk eôntes apallattesthai, kan toutô\r\n  nikan hypolambanousi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             III\r\n\r\nThus, every hypothesis of _channels_[182] as an explanation of natural\r\nfunctioning is perfect nonsense. For, if there were not _an inborn\r\nfaculty_ given by Nature to each one of the organs at the very\r\nbeginning, then animals could not continue to live even for a few\r\ndays, far less for the number of years which they actually do. For let\r\nus suppose they were under no guardianship, lacking in creative\r\ningenuity[183] and forethought; let us suppose they were steered only\r\nby material forces,[184] and not by any special _faculties_ (the one\r\nattracting what is proper to it, another rejecting what is foreign,\r\nand yet another causing alteration and adhesion of the matter destined\r\nto nourish it); if we suppose this, I am sure it would be ridiculous\r\nfor us to discuss natural, or, still more, psychical, activities--or,\r\nin fact, life as a whole.[185]\r\n\r\nFor there is not a single animal which could live or endure for the\r\nshortest time if, possessing within itself so many different parts, it\r\ndid not employ faculties which were attractive of what is appropriate,\r\neliminative of what is foreign, and alterative of what is destined for\r\nnutrition. On the other hand, if we have these faculties, we no longer\r\nneed _channels_, little or big, resting on an unproven hypothesis, for\r\nexplaining the secretion of urine and bile, and the conception of some\r\n_favourable situation_ (in which point alone Erasistratus shows some\r\ncommon sense, since he does regard all the parts of the body as having\r\nbeen well and truly placed and shaped by Nature).\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose he remained true to his own statement that Nature\r\nis \"artistic\"--this Nature which, at the beginning, well and truly\r\nshaped and disposed all the parts of the animal,[186] and, after\r\ncarrying out this function (for she left nothing undone), brought it\r\nforward to the light of day, endowed with certain faculties necessary\r\nfor its very existence, and, thereafter, gradually increased it until\r\nit reached its due size. If he argued consistently on this principle,\r\nI fail to see how he can continue to refer natural functions to the\r\nsmallness or largeness of canals, or to any other similarly absurd\r\nhypothesis. For this Nature which shapes and gradually adds to the\r\nparts is most certainly extended throughout their whole substance. Yes\r\nindeed, she shapes and nourishes and increases them through and\r\nthrough, not on the outside only. For Praxiteles and Phidias and all\r\nthe other statuaries used merely to decorate their material on the\r\noutside, in so far as they were able to touch it; but its inner parts\r\nthey left unembellished, unwrought, unaffected by art or forethought,\r\nsince they were unable to penetrate therein and to reach and handle\r\nall portions of the material. It is not so, however, with Nature.\r\nEvery part of a bone she makes bone, every part of the flesh she makes\r\nflesh, and so with fat and all the rest; there is no part which she\r\nhas not touched, elaborated, and embellished. Phidias, on the other\r\nhand, could not turn wax into ivory and gold, nor yet gold into wax:\r\nfor each of these remains as it was at the commencement, and becomes a\r\nperfect statue simply by being clothed externally in a form and\r\nartificial shape. But Nature does not preserve the original character\r\nof any kind of matter; if she did so then all parts of the animal\r\nwould be blood--that blood, namely, which flows to the semen from the\r\nimpregnated female and which is, so to speak, like the statuary's wax,\r\na single uniform matter, subjected to the artificer. From this blood\r\nthere arises no part of the animal which is as red and moist [as blood\r\nis], for bone, artery, vein, nerve, cartilage, fat, gland, membrane,\r\nand marrow are not blood, though they arise from it.\r\n\r\nI would then ask Erasistratus himself to inform me what the altering,\r\ncoagulating, and shaping agent is. He would doubtless say, \"Either\r\nNature or the semen,\" meaning the same thing in both cases, but\r\nexplaining it by different devices. For that which was previously\r\nsemen, when it begins to procreate and to shape the animal, becomes,\r\nso to say, a special _nature_.[187] For in the same way that Phidias\r\npossessed the faculties of his art even before touching his material,\r\nand then activated these in connection with this material (for every\r\nfaculty remains inoperative in the absence of its proper material), so\r\nit is with the semen: its faculties it possessed from the\r\nbeginning,[188] while its activities it does not receive from its\r\nmaterial, but it manifests them in connection therewith.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, if it were to be overwhelmed with a great quantity of\r\nblood, it would perish, while if it were to be entirely deprived of\r\nblood it would remain inoperative and would not turn into a _nature_.\r\nTherefore, in order that it may not perish, but may become a _nature_\r\nin place of semen, there must be an afflux to it of a little\r\nblood--or, rather, one should not say a little, but a quantity\r\ncommensurate with that of the semen. What is it then that measures the\r\nquantity of this afflux? What prevents more from coming? What ensures\r\nagainst a deficiency? What is this third overseer of animal generation\r\nthat we are to look for, which will furnish the semen with a due\r\namount of blood? What would Erasistratus have said if he had been\r\nalive, and had been asked this question? Obviously, the semen itself.\r\nThis, in fact, is the artificer analogous with Phidias, whilst the\r\nblood corresponds to the statuary's wax.\r\n\r\nNow, it is not for the wax to discover for itself how much of it is\r\nrequired; that is the business of Phidias. Accordingly the artificer\r\nwill draw to itself as much blood as it needs. Here, however, we must\r\npay attention and take care not unwittingly to credit the semen with\r\nreason and intelligence; if we were to do this, we would be making\r\nneither semen nor a nature, but an actual living animal.[189] And if\r\nwe retain these two principles--that of proportionate attraction[190]\r\nand that of the non-participation of intelligence--we shall ascribe to\r\nthe semen a faculty for attracting blood similar to that possessed by\r\nthe lodestone for iron.[191] Here, then, again, in the case of the\r\nsemen, as in so many previous instances, we have been compelled to\r\nacknowledge some kind of attractive faculty.\r\n\r\nAnd what is the semen? Clearly the active principle of the animal, the\r\nmaterial principle being the menstrual blood.[192] Next, seeing that\r\nthe active principle employs this faculty primarily, therefore, in\r\norder that any one of the things fashioned by it may come into\r\nexistence, it [the principle] must necessarily be possessed of its own\r\nfaculty. How, then, was Erasistratus unaware of it, if the primary\r\nfunction of the semen be to draw to itself a due proportion of blood?\r\nNow, this fluid would be in due proportion if it were so thin and\r\nvaporous, that, as soon as it was drawn like dew into every part of\r\nthe semen, it would everywhere cease to display its own particular\r\ncharacter; for so the semen will easily dominate and quickly\r\nassimilate it--in fact, will use it as food. It will then, I imagine,\r\ndraw to itself a second and a third quantum, and thus by feeding it\r\nacquires for itself considerable bulk and quantity.[193] In fact, _the\r\nalterative faculty_ has now been discovered as well, although about\r\nthis also Erasistratus has not written a word. And, thirdly the\r\n_shaping_[194] faculty will become evident, by virtue of which the\r\nsemen firstly surrounds itself with a thin membrane like a kind of\r\nsuperficial condensation; this is what was described by Hippocrates in\r\nthe sixth-day birth, which, according to his statement, fell from the\r\nsinging-girl and resembled the pellicle of an egg. And following this\r\nall the other stages will occur, such as are described by him in his\r\nwork \"On the Child's Nature.\"\r\n\r\nBut if each of the parts formed were to remain as small as when it\r\nfirst came into existence, of what use would that be? They have, then,\r\nto grow. Now, how will they grow? By becoming extended in all\r\ndirections and at the same time receiving nourishment. And if you will\r\nrecall what I previously said about the bladder which the children\r\nblew up and rubbed,[195] you will also understand my meaning better as\r\nexpressed in what I am now about to say.\r\n\r\nImagine the heart to be, at the beginning, so small as to differ in no\r\nrespect from a millet-seed, or, if you will, a bean; and consider how\r\notherwise it is to become large than by being extended in all\r\ndirections and acquiring nourishment throughout its whole substance,\r\nin the way that, as I showed a short while ago, the semen is\r\nnourished. But even this was unknown to Erasistratus--the man who\r\nsings the artistic skill of Nature! He imagines that animals grow like\r\nwebs, ropes, sacks, or baskets, each of which has, woven on to its end\r\nor margin, other material similar to that of which it was originally\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nBut this, most sapient sir, is not growth, but genesis! For a bag,\r\nsack, garment, house, ship, or the like is said to be still coming\r\ninto existence [undergoing genesis] so long as the appropriate form\r\nfor the sake of which it is being constructed by the artificer is\r\nstill incomplete. Then, when does it grow? Only when the basket, being\r\ncomplete, with a bottom, a mouth, and a belly, as it were, as well as\r\nthe intermediate parts, now becomes larger in all these respects. \"And\r\nhow can this happen?\" someone will ask. Only by our basket suddenly\r\nbecoming an animal or a plant; for growth belongs to living things\r\nalone. Possibly you imagine that a house _grows_ when it is being\r\nbuilt, or a basket when being plaited, or a garment when being woven?\r\nIt is not so however. Growth belongs to that which has already been\r\ncompleted in respect to its form, whereas the process by which that\r\nwhich is still _becoming_ attains its form is termed not growth but\r\ngenesis.

Now, in so far as he acclaims\r\nNature as being an artist in construction, even I recognize the\r\nPeripatetic teachings, but in other respects he does not come near\r\nthem. For if anyone will make himself acquainted with the writings\r\nof Aristotle and Theophrastus, these will appear to him to consist\r\nof commentaries on the Nature-lore [physiology][196] of\r\nHippocrates--according to which the principles of heat, cold, dryness\r\nand moisture act upon and are acted upon by one another, the hot\r\nprinciple being the most active, and the cold coming next to it in\r\npower; all this was stated in the first place by Hippocrates and\r\nsecondly by Aristotle.[197] Further, it is at once the Hippocratic and\r\nthe Aristotelian teaching that the parts which are being nourished\r\nreceive that nourishment throughout their whole substance, and that,\r\nsimilarly, processes of _mingling_ and _alteration_ involve the entire\r\nsubstance.[198] Moreover, that digestion is a species of alteration--a\r\ntransmutation of the nutriment into the proper quality of the thing\r\nreceiving it; that blood-production also is an alteration, and\r\nnutrition as well; that growth results from extension in all\r\ndirections, combined with nutrition; that alteration is effected\r\nmainly by the warm principle, and that therefore digestion, nutrition,\r\nand the generation of the various humours, as well as the qualities of\r\nthe surplus substances, result from the _innate heat_;[199] all these\r\nand many other points besides in regard to the aforesaid faculties,\r\nthe origin of diseases, and the discovery of remedies, were correctly\r\nstated first by Hippocrates of all writers whom we know, and were in\r\nthe second place correctly expounded by Aristotle. Now, if all these\r\nviews meet with the approval of the Peripatetics, as they undoubtedly\r\ndo, and if none of them satisfy Erasistratus, what can the\r\nErasistrateans possibly mean by claiming that their leader was\r\nassociated with these philosophers? The fact is, they revere him as a\r\ngod, and think that everything he says is true. If this be so, then we\r\nmust suppose the Peripatetics to have strayed very far from truth,\r\nsince they approve of none of the ideas of Erasistratus. And, indeed,\r\nthe disciples of the latter produce his connection with the\r\nPeripatetics in order to furnish his Nature-lore with a respectable\r\npedigree.\r\n\r\nNow, let us reverse our argument and put it in a different way from\r\nthat which we have just employed. For if the Peripatetics were correct\r\nin their teaching about Nature, there could be nothing more absurd\r\nthan the contentions of Erasistratus. And, I will leave it to the\r\nErasistrateans themselves to decide; they must either advance the one\r\nproposition or the other. According to the former one the Peripatetics\r\nhad no accurate acquaintance with Nature, and according to the second,\r\nErasistratus. It is my task, then, to point out the opposition between\r\nthe two doctrines, and theirs to make the choice....\r\n\r\nBut they certainly will not abandon their reverence for Erasistratus.\r\nVery well, then; let them stop talking about the Peripatetic\r\nphilosophers. For among the numerous physiological teachings regarding\r\nthe genesis and destruction of animals, their health, their diseases,\r\nand the methods of treating these, there will be found one only which\r\nis common to Erasistratus and the Peripatetics--namely, the view that\r\nNature does everything for some purpose, and nothing in vain.\r\n\r\nBut even as regards this doctrine their agreement is only verbal; in\r\npractice Erasistratus makes havoc of it a thousand times over. For,\r\naccording to him, the spleen was made for no purpose, as also the\r\nomentum; similarly, too, the arteries which are inserted into\r\nkidneys[200]--although these are practically the largest of all those\r\nthat spring from the great artery [aorta]! And to judge by the\r\nErasistratean argument, there must be countless other useless\r\nstructures; for, if he knows nothing at all about these structures, he\r\nhas little more anatomical knowledge than a butcher, while, if he is\r\nacquainted with them and yet does not state their use, he clearly\r\nimagines that they were made for no purpose, like the spleen. Why,\r\nhowever, should I discuss these structures fully, belonging as they do\r\nto the treatise \"On the Use of Parts,\" which I am personally about to\r\ncomplete?\r\n\r\nLet us, then, sum up again this same argument, and, having said a few\r\nwords more in answer to the Erasistrateans, proceed to our next topic.\r\nThe fact is, these people seem to me to have read none of Aristotle's\r\nwritings, but to have heard from others how great an authority he was\r\non \"Nature,\" and that those of the Porch[201] follow in the steps of\r\nhis Nature-lore; apparently they then discovered a single one of the\r\ncurrent ideas which is common to Aristotle and Erasistratus, and made\r\nup some story of a connection between Erasistratus and these\r\npeople.[202] That Erasistratus, however, has no share in the\r\nNature-lore of Aristotle is shown by an enumeration of the aforesaid\r\ndoctrines, which emanated first from Hippocrates, secondly from\r\nAristotle, thirdly from the Stoics (with a single modification,\r\nnamely, that for them the _qualities_ are _bodies_).[203]\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, they will maintain that it was in the matter of\r\n_logic_ that Erasistratus associated himself with the Peripatetic\r\nphilosophers? Here they show ignorance of the fact that these\r\nphilosophers never brought forward false or inconclusive arguments,\r\nwhile the Erasistratean books are full of them.\r\n\r\nSo perhaps somebody may already be asking, in some surprise, what\r\npossessed Erasistratus that he turned so completely from the doctrines\r\nof Hippocrates, and why it is that he takes away the attractive\r\nfaculty from the biliary[204] passages in the liver--for we have\r\nsufficiently discussed the kidneys--alleging [as the cause of\r\nbile-secretion] a favourable situation, the narrowness of vessels, and\r\n_a common space_ into which the veins from the gateway [of the\r\nliver][205] conduct the unpurified blood, and from which, in the first\r\nplace, the [biliary] passages take over the bile, and secondly, the\r\n[branches] of the vena cava take over the purified blood.

Either they mean there is a\r\n_junction_[207] between the termination of the vein which is on the\r\nconcave surface of the liver[208] and two other vascular terminations\r\n(that of the vessel on the convex surface of the liver[209] and that\r\nof the bile-duct), or, if not, then we must suppose that there is, as\r\nit were, a common space for all three vessels, which becomes filled\r\nfrom the lower vein,[210] and empties itself both into the bile-duct\r\nand into the branches of the vena cava. Now, there are many\r\ndifficulties in both of these explanations, but if I were to state\r\nthem all, I should find myself inadvertently writing an exposition of\r\nthe teaching of Erasistratus, instead of carrying out my original\r\nundertaking. There is, however, one difficulty common to both these\r\nexplanations, namely, that the whole of the blood does not become\r\npurified. For it ought to fall into the bile-duct as into a kind of\r\nsieve, instead of going (running, in fact, rapidly) past it, into the\r\nlarger stoma, by virtue of the impulse of _anadosis_.\r\n\r\nAre these, then, the only inevitable difficulties in which the\r\nargument of Erasistratus becomes involved through his disinclination\r\nto make any use of the attractive faculty, or is it that the\r\ndifficulty is greatest here, and also so obvious that even a child\r\ncould not avoid seeing it?\r\n\r\n\r\n                        V\r\n\r\n  Hôs nyn ge polemos ou smikros esti tois Erasistrateiois\r\n  ou pros tous allous monon alla kai pros allêlous, ouk\r\n  echousin, hopôs exêgêsôntai tên ek tou prôtou tôn\r\n  katholou logôn lexin, en hê phêsin; \"Eis to || auto d'         94\r\n  anestomômenôn heterôn anestomômenôn heterôn dyo angeiôn\r\n  tôn t' epi tên cholêdochon teinontôn kai tôn epi tên\r\n  koilên phleba symbainei tês anapheromenês ek tês koilias\r\n  trophês ta enarmozonta hekaterois tôn stomatôn eis\r\n  hekatera tôn angeiôn metalambanesthai kai ta men epi tên\r\n  cholêdochon pheresthai, ta d' epi tên koilên phleba\r\n  peraiousthai.\" to gar \"eis to auto anestomômenôn,\" ho\r\n  kat' archas tês lexeôs gegraptai, ti pote chrê noêsai,\r\n  chalepon eipein. êtoi gar houtôs eis tauton, hôste tô\r\n  tês en tois simois phlebos perati synaptein dyo hetera\r\n  perata, to t' en tois kyrtois kai to tou cholêdochou\r\n  porou, ê, ei mê houtô, chôran tina koinên epinoêsai chrê\r\n  tôn triôn angeiôn hoion dexamenên tina, plêroumenên men\r\n  hypo tês katô phlebos, ekkenoumenên d' eis te tous\r\n  cholêdochous porous kai tas tês koilês aposchidas; kath'\r\n  hekateran de tôn exêgêseôn atopa polla, peri hôn ei\r\n  pantôn legoimi, lathoim' an emauton exêgêseis\r\n  Erasistratou graphôn, ouch, hoper ex archês prouthemên,\r\n  perainôn. koinon d' amphoterais tais exêgêsesin atopon\r\n  to mê || kathairesthai pan to haima. chrê gar hôs eis          95\r\n  êthmon tina to cholêdochon angeion empiptein auto, ou\r\n  parerchesthai kai pararrhein ôkeôs eis to meizon stoma\r\n  tê rhymê tês anadoseôs pheromenon.\r\n\r\n  Ar' oun en toutois monon aporiais aphyktois ho\r\n  Erasistratou logos enechetai mê boulêthentos chrêsasthai\r\n  tais helktikais dynamesin eis mêden, ê sphodrotata men\r\n  en toutois kai saphôs houtôs, hôs an mêde paida lathein?\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VI\r\n\r\nAnd if one looks carefully into the matter one will find that even\r\nErasistratus's reasoning on the subject of _nutrition_, which he takes\r\nup in the second book of his \"General Principles,\" fails to escape\r\nthis same difficulty. For, having conceded one premise to the\r\nprinciple that matter tends to fill a vacuum, as we previously showed,\r\nhe was only able to draw a conclusion in the case of the veins and\r\ntheir contained blood.[211] That is to say, when blood is running\r\naway through the stomata of the veins, and is being dispersed, then,\r\nsince an absolutely empty space cannot result, and the veins cannot\r\ncollapse (for this was what he overlooked), it was therefore shown to\r\nbe necessary that the adjoining quantum of fluid should flow in and\r\nfill the place of the fluid evacuated. It is in this way that we may\r\nsuppose the veins to be nourished; they get the benefit of the blood\r\nwhich they contain. But how about the nerves?[212] For they do not\r\nalso contain blood. One might obviously say that they draw their\r\nsupply from the veins.[213] But Erasistratus will not have it so. What\r\nfurther contrivance, then, does he suppose? He says that a nerve has\r\nwithin itself veins and arteries, like a rope woven by Nature out of\r\nthree different strands. By means of this hypothesis he imagined that\r\nhis theory would escape from the idea of _attraction_. For if the\r\nnerve contain within itself a blood-vessel it will no longer need the\r\nadventitious flow of other blood from the real vein lying adjacent;\r\nthis fictitious vessel, perceptible only in theory,[214] will suffice\r\nit for nourishment.\r\n\r\nBut this, again, is succeeded by another similar difficulty. For this\r\nsmall vessel will nourish itself, but it will not be able to nourish\r\nthis adjacent simple nerve or artery, unless these possess some innate\r\nproclivity for attracting nutriment. For how could the _nerve_, being\r\nsimple, attract its nourishment, as do the composite veins, by virtue\r\nof the tendency of a vacuum to become refilled? For, although\r\naccording to Erasistratus, it contains within itself a cavity of\r\nsorts, this is not occupied with blood, but with _psychic\r\npneuma_,[215] and we are required to imagine the nutriment introduced,\r\nnot into this cavity, but into the vessel containing it, whether it\r\nneeds merely to be nourished, or to grow as well. How, then, are we to\r\nimagine it introduced? For this simple vessel [_i.e._ nerve] is so\r\nsmall--as are also the other two--that if you prick it at any part\r\nwith the finest needle you will tear the whole three of them at once.\r\nThus there could never be in it a perceptible space entirely empty.\r\nAnd an emptied space which merely existed in theory could not compel\r\nthe adjacent fluid to come and fill it.\r\n\r\nAt this point, again, I should like Erasistratus himself to answer\r\nregarding this small elementary nerve, whether it is actually one and\r\ndefinitely continuous, or whether it consists of many small bodies,\r\nsuch as those assumed by Epicurus, Leucippus, and Democritus.[216] For\r\nI see that the Erasistrateans are at variance on this subject. Some of\r\nthem consider it one and continuous, for otherwise, as they say, he\r\nwould not have called it _simple_; and some venture to resolve it into\r\nyet other elementary bodies. But if it be one and continuous, then\r\nwhat is evacuated from it in the so-called _insensible transpiration_\r\nof the physicians will leave no empty space in it; otherwise it would\r\nnot be one body but many, separated by empty spaces. But if it\r\nconsists of many bodies, then we have \"escaped by the back door,\" as\r\nthe saying is, to Asclepiades, seeing that we have postulated certain\r\n_inharmonious elements_. Once again, then, we must call Nature\r\n\"inartistic\"; for this necessarily follows the assumption of such\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nFor this reason some of the Erasistrateans seem to me to have done\r\nvery foolishly in reducing the simple vessels to elements such as\r\nthese. Yet it makes no difference to me, since the theory of both\r\nparties regarding nutrition will be shown to be absurd. For in these\r\nminute simple vessels constituting the large perceptible nerves, it is\r\nimpossible, according to the theory of those who would keep the former\r\ncontinuous, that any \"refilling of a vacuum\" should take place, since\r\nno vacuum can occur in a continuum even if anything does run away; for\r\nthe parts left come together (as is seen in the case of water) and\r\nagain become one, taking up the whole space of that which previously\r\nseparated them. Nor will any \"refilling\" occur if we accept the\r\nargument of the other Erasistrateans, since none of their _elements_\r\nneed it. For this principle only holds of things which are\r\nperceptible, and not of those which exist merely in theory; this\r\nErasistratus expressly acknowledges, for he states that it is not a\r\nvacuum such as this, interspersed in small portions among the\r\ncorpuscles, that his various treatises deal with, but a vacuum which\r\nis clear, perceptible, complete in itself, large in size, evident, or\r\nhowever else one cares to term it (for, what Erasistratus himself says\r\nis, that \"there cannot be a perceptible space which is entirely\r\nempty\"; while I, for my part, being abundantly equipped with terms\r\nwhich are equally elucidatory, at least in relation to the present\r\ntopic of discussion, have added them as well).\r\n\r\nThus it seems to me better that we also should help the Erasistrateans\r\nwith some contribution, since we are on the subject, and should advise\r\nthose who reduce the vessel called _primary_ and _simple_ by\r\nErasistratus into other elementary bodies to give up their opinion;\r\nfor not only do they gain nothing by it, but they are also at variance\r\nwith Erasistratus in this matter. That they gain nothing by it has\r\nbeen clearly demonstrated; for this hypothesis could not escape the\r\ndifficulty regarding _nutrition_. And it also seems perfectly evident\r\nto me that this hypothesis is not in consonance with the view of\r\nErasistratus, when it declares that what he calls simple and primary\r\nis composite, and when it destroys the principle of Nature's artistic\r\nskill.[217] For, if we do not grant a certain _unity of\r\nsubstance_[218] to these simple structures as well, and if we arrive\r\neventually at inharmonious and indivisible elements,[219] we shall\r\nmost assuredly deprive Nature of her artistic skill, as do all the\r\nphysicians and philosophers who start from this hypothesis. For,\r\naccording to such a hypothesis, Nature does not precede, but is\r\nsecondary to the _parts_ of the animal.[220] Now, it is not the\r\nprovince of what comes secondarily, but of what pre-exists, to shape\r\nand to construct. Thus we must necessarily suppose that the faculties\r\nof Nature, by which she shapes the animal, and makes it grow and\r\nreceive nourishment, are present from the seed onwards; whereas none\r\nof these inharmonious and non-partite corpuscles contains within\r\nitself any formative, incremental,[221] nutritive, or, in a word, any\r\nartistic power; it is, by hypothesis, unimpressionable and\r\nuntransformable,[222] whereas, as we have previously shown,[223] none\r\nof the processes mentioned takes place without transformation,\r\nalteration, and complete intermixture. And, owing to this necessity,\r\nthose who belong to these sects are unable to follow out the\r\nconsequences of their supposed elements, and they are all therefore\r\nforced to declare Nature devoid of art. It is not from us, however,\r\nthat the Erasistrateans should have learnt this, but from those very\r\nphilosophers who lay most stress on a preliminary investigation into\r\nthe elements of all existing things.\r\n\r\nNow, one can hardly be right in supposing that Erasistratus could\r\nreach such a pitch of foolishness as to be incapable of recognizing\r\nthe logical consequences of this theory, and that, while assuming\r\nNature to be artistically creative, he would at the same time break up\r\nsubstance into insensible, inharmonious, and untransformable elements.\r\nIf, however, he will grant that there occurs in the elements a process\r\nof alteration and transformation, and that there exists in them unity\r\nand continuity, then that _simple vessel_ of his (as he himself names\r\nit) will turn out to be single and uncompounded. And the simple vein\r\nwill receive nourishment from itself, and the nerve and artery from\r\nthe vein. How, and in what way? For, when we were at this point\r\nbefore, we drew attention to the disagreement among the\r\nErasistrateans,[224] and we showed that the nutrition of these simple\r\nvessels was impracticable according to the teachings of both parties,\r\nalthough we did not hesitate to adjudicate in their quarrel and to do\r\nErasistratus the honour of placing him in the better sect.[225]\r\n\r\nLet our argument, then, be transferred again to the doctrine which\r\nassumes this _elementary nerve_[226] to be a single, simple, and\r\nentirely unified structure, and let us consider how it is to be\r\nnourished; for what is discovered here will at once be found to be\r\ncommon also to the school of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that our enquiry can be most rigorously pursued in\r\nsubjects who are suffering from illness and have become very\r\nemaciated, since in these people all parts of the body are obviously\r\natrophied and thin, and in need of additional substance and\r\nfeeding-up; for the same reason the ordinary _perceptible_ nerve,\r\nregarding which we originally began this discussion, has become thin,\r\nand requires nourishment. Now, this contains within itself various\r\nparts, namely, a great many of these primary, invisible, minute\r\nnerves, a few simple arteries, and similarly also veins. Thus, all its\r\nelementary nerves have themselves also obviously become emaciated;\r\nfor, if they had not, neither would the nerve as a whole; and of\r\ncourse, in such a case, the whole nerve cannot require nourishment\r\nwithout each of these requiring it too. Now, if on the one hand they\r\nstand in need of feeding-up, and if on the other the principle of the\r\nrefilling of a vacuum[227] can give them no help--both by reason of\r\nthe difficulties previously mentioned and the actual thinness, as I\r\nshall show--we must then seek another cause for nutrition.\r\n\r\nHow is it, then, that the tendency of a vacuum to become refilled is\r\nunable to afford nourishment to one in such a condition? Because its\r\nrule is that only so much of the contiguous matter should succeed as\r\nhas flowed away. Now this is sufficient for nourishment in the case\r\nof those who are in good condition, for, in them, what is\r\n_presented_[228] must be equal to what has flowed away. But in the\r\ncase of those who are very emaciated and who need a great restoration\r\nof nutrition, unless what was presented were many times greater than\r\nwhat has been emptied out, they would never be able to regain their\r\noriginal habit. It is clear, therefore, that these parts will have to\r\nexert a greater amount of _attraction_, in so far as their\r\nrequirements are greater. And I fail to understand how Erasistratus\r\ndoes not perceive that here again he is putting the cart before the\r\nhorse. Because, in the case of the sick, there must be a large amount\r\nof _presentation_[228] in order to feed them up, he argues that the\r\nfactor of \"refilling\"[227] must play an equally large part. And how\r\ncould much _presentation_ take place if it were not preceded by an\r\nabundant _delivery_[229] of nutriment? And if he calls the conveyance\r\nof food through the veins delivery, and its assumption by each of\r\nthese simple and visible nerves and arteries not delivery but\r\n_distribution_,[230] as some people have thought fit to name it, and\r\nthen ascribes conveyance through the veins to the principle of\r\nvacuum-refilling alone, let him explain to us the assumption of food\r\nby the hypothetical elements.[231] For it has been shown that at least\r\nin relation to these there is no question of the refilling of a vacuum\r\nbeing in operation, and especially where the parts are very\r\nattenuated. It is worth while listening to what Erasistratus says\r\nabout these cases in the second book of his \"General Principles\": \"In\r\nthe ultimate simple [vessels], which are thin and narrow, presentation\r\ntakes place from the adjacent vessels, the nutriment being attracted\r\nthrough the sides of the vessels and deposited in the empty spaces\r\nleft by the matter which has been carried away.\" Now, in this\r\nstatement firstly I admit and accept the words \"through the sides.\"\r\nFor, if the simple nerve were actually to take in the food through its\r\nmouth, it could not distribute it through its whole substance; for the\r\nmouth is dedicated to the psychic pneuma.[232] It can, however, take\r\nit in through its sides from the adjacent simple vein.

How else than in\r\nthe way that iron is attracted by the lodestone, the latter having a\r\nfaculty attractive of this particular quality [existing in iron]?[233]\r\nBut if the beginning of anadosis depends on the squeezing action of\r\nthe stomach,[234] and the whole movement thereafter on the peristalsis\r\nand propulsive action of the veins, as well as on the traction exerted\r\nby each of the parts which are undergoing nourishment, then we can\r\nabandon the principle of replacement of evacuated matter, as not being\r\nsuitable for a man who assumes Nature to be a skilled artist; thus we\r\nshall also have avoided the contradiction of Asclepiades[235] though\r\nwe cannot refute it: for the disjunctive argument used for the\r\npurposes of demonstration is, in reality, disjunctive not of two but\r\nof three alternatives; now, if we treat the disjunction as a\r\ndisjunction of two alternatives, one of the two propositions assumed\r\nin constructing our proof must be false; and if as a disjunctive of\r\nthree alternatives, no conclusion will be arrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VII\r\n\r\n  Exeurômen oun koinê, pôs helketai. pôs d' allôs ê hôs ho\r\n  sidêros hypo tês hêrakleias lithou dynamin echousês\r\n  helktikên toiautês poiotêtos? all' ei tên men archên tês\r\n  anadoseôs hê tês koilias enthlipsis parechetai, tên de\r\n  meta tauta phoran hapasan hai te phlebes peristellomenai\r\n  kai proôthousai kai tôn trephomenôn hekaston epispômenon\r\n  eis heauto, tês pros to kenoumenon akolouthias\r\n  apostantes, hôs ou prepousês andri technikên hypothemenô\r\n  tên physin, houtôs an êdê kai tên antilogian eiêmen\r\n  pepheugotes tên Asklêpiadou mê dynamenoi ge lyein autên.\r\n  to gar eis tên apodeixin paralambanomenon lêmma to\r\n  diezeugmenon ouk ek dyoin all' ek triôn esti kata ge tên\r\n  alêtheian diezeugmenon. ei men oun hôs ek dyoin autô\r\n  chrê||saimetha, pseudos estai ti tôn eis tên apodeixin        107\r\n  pareilêmmenôn; ei d' hôs ek triôn, aperantos ho logos\r\n  genêsetai.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VIII\r\n\r\nNow Erasistratus ought not to have been ignorant of this if he had\r\never had anything to do with the Peripatetics--even in a dream. Nor,\r\nsimilarly, should he have been unacquainted with the genesis of the\r\n_humours_, about which, not having even anything moderately plausible\r\nto say, he thinks to deceive us by the excuse that the consideration\r\nof such matters is not the least useful. Then, in Heaven's name, is it\r\nuseful to know how food is digested in the stomach, but unnecessary to\r\nknow how _bile_ comes into existence in the veins? Are we to pay\r\nattention merely to the evacuation of this humour, and not to its\r\ngenesis? As though it were not far better to prevent its excessive\r\ndevelopment from the beginning than to give ourselves all the trouble\r\nof expelling it![236] And it is a strange thing to be entirely unaware\r\nas to whether its genesis is to be looked on as taking place in the\r\nbody, or whether it comes from without and is contained in the food.\r\nFor, if it was right to raise this problem, why should we not make\r\ninvestigations concerning the _blood_ as well--whether it takes its\r\norigin in the body, or is distributed through the food as is\r\nmaintained by those who postulate _homoemeries_?[237] Assuredly it\r\nwould be much more useful to investigate what kinds of food are\r\nsuited, and what kinds unsuited, to the process of\r\nblood-production[238] rather than to enquire into what articles of\r\ndiet are easily mastered by the activity of the stomach, and what\r\nresist and contend with it. For the choice of the latter bears\r\nreference merely to digestion, while that of the former is of\r\nimportance in regard to the generation of useful blood. For it is not\r\nequally important whether the aliment be imperfectly chylified[239] in\r\nthe stomach or whether it fail to be turned into useful blood. Why is\r\nErasistratus not ashamed to distinguish all the various kinds of\r\ndigestive failure and all the occasions which give rise to them,\r\nwhilst in reference to the errors of blood-production he does not\r\nutter a single word--nay, not a syllable? Now, there is certainly to\r\nbe found in the veins both thick and thin blood; in some people it is\r\nredder, in others yellower, in some blacker, in others more of the\r\nnature of phlegm. And one who realizes that it may smell offensively\r\nnot in one way only, but in a great many different respects (which\r\ncannot be put into words, although perfectly appreciable to the\r\nsenses), would, I imagine, condemn in no measured terms the\r\ncarelessness of Erasistratus in omitting a consideration so essential\r\nto the practice of our art.\r\n\r\nThus it is clear what errors in regard to the subject of _dropsies_\r\nlogically follow this carelessness. For, does it not show the most\r\nextreme carelessness to suppose that the blood is prevented from going\r\nforward into the liver owing to the _narrowness of the passages_, and\r\nthat dropsy can never occur in any other way? For, to imagine that\r\ndropsy is never caused by the spleen[240] or any other part, but\r\nalways by induration of the liver,[241] is the standpoint of a man\r\nwhose intelligence is perfectly torpid and who is quite out of touch\r\nwith things that happen every day. For, not merely once or twice, but\r\nfrequently, we have observed dropsy produced by chronic haemorrhoids\r\nwhich have been suppressed,[242] or which, through immoderate\r\nbleeding, have given the patient a severe chill; similarly, in women,\r\nthe complete disappearance of the monthly discharge,[243] or an undue\r\nevacuation such as is caused by violent bleeding from the womb, often\r\nprovoke dropsy; and in some of them the so-called female flux ends in\r\nthis disorder. I leave out of account the dropsy which begins in the\r\nflanks or in any other susceptible part; this clearly confutes\r\nErasistratus's assumption, although not so obviously as does that kind\r\nof dropsy which is brought about by an excessive chilling of the whole\r\nconstitution; this, which is the primary reason for the occurrence of\r\ndropsy, results from a failure of blood-production,[244] very much\r\nlike the diarrhoea which follows imperfect digestion of food;\r\ncertainly in this kind of dropsy neither the liver nor any other\r\nviscus becomes indurated.\r\n\r\nThe learned Erasistratus, however, overlooks--nay, despises--what\r\nneither Hippocrates, Diocles, Praxagoras, nor Philistion[245]\r\ndespised, nor indeed any of the best philosophers, whether Plato,\r\nAristotle, or Theophrastus; he passes by whole functions as though it\r\nwere but a trifling and casual department of medicine which he was\r\nneglecting, without deigning to argue whether or not these authorities\r\nare right in saying that the bodily parts of all animals are governed\r\nby the Warm, the Cold, the Dry and the Moist, the one pair being\r\nactive and the other passive, and that among these the Warm has most\r\npower in connection with all functions, but especially with the\r\ngenesis of the humours.[246] Now, one cannot be blamed for not\r\nagreeing with all these great men, nor for imagining that one knows\r\nmore than they; but not to consider such distinguished teaching worthy\r\neither of contradiction or even mention shows an extraordinary\r\narrogance.\r\n\r\nNow, Erasistratus is thoroughly small-minded and petty to the last\r\ndegree in all his disputations--when, for instance, in his treatise\r\n\"On Digestion,\"[247] he argues jealously with those who consider that\r\nthis is a process of putrefaction of the food; and, in his work \"On\r\nAnadosis,\"[248] with those who think that the anadosis of blood\r\nthrough the veins results from the contiguity of the arteries; also,\r\nin his work \"On Respiration,\" with those who maintain that the air is\r\nforced along by contraction. Nay, he did not even hesitate to\r\ncontradict those who maintain that the urine passes into the bladder\r\nin a vaporous state,[249] as also those who say that imbibed fluids\r\nare carried into the lung. Thus he delights to choose always the most\r\nvalueless doctrines, and to spend his time more and more in\r\ncontradicting these; whereas on the subject of the _origin of blood_\r\n(which is in no way less important than the chylification[250] of food\r\nin the stomach) he did not deign to dispute with any of the ancients,\r\nnor did he himself venture to bring forward any other opinion, despite\r\nthe fact that at the beginning of his treatise on \"General Principles\"\r\nhe undertook to say how all the various natural functions take place,\r\nand through what parts of the animal! Now, is it possible that, when\r\nthe faculty which naturally digests food is weak, the animal's\r\ndigestion fails, whereas the faculty which turns the digested food\r\ninto blood cannot suffer any kind of impairment?[251] Are we to\r\nsuppose this latter faculty alone to be as tough as steel and\r\nunaffected by circumstances? Or is it that weakness of this faculty\r\nwill result in something else than dropsy? The fact, therefore, that\r\nErasistratus, in regard to other matters, did not hesitate to attack\r\neven the most trivial views, whilst in this case he neither dared to\r\ncontradict his predecessors nor to advance any new view of his own,\r\nproves plainly that he recognized the fallacy of his own way of\r\nthinking.[252]\r\n\r\nFor what could a man possibly say about blood who had no use for\r\n_innate heat_? What could he say about yellow or black bile, or\r\nphlegm? Well, of course, he might say that the bile could come\r\ndirectly from without, mingled with the food! Thus Erasistratus\r\npractically says so in the following words: \"It is of no value in\r\npractical medicine to find out whether a fluid of this kind[253]\r\narises from the elaboration of food in the stomach-region, or whether\r\nit reaches the body because it is mixed with the food taken in from\r\noutside.\" But, my very good Sir, you most certainly maintain also that\r\nthis humour has to be evacuated from the animal, and that it causes\r\ngreat pain if it be not evacuated. How, then, if you suppose that no\r\ngood comes from the bile, do you venture to say that an investigation\r\ninto its origin is of no value in medicine?\r\n\r\nWell, let us suppose that it is contained in the food, and not\r\nspecifically secreted in the liver (for you hold these two things\r\npossible). In this case, it will certainly make a considerable\r\ndifference whether the ingested food contains a minimum or a maximum\r\nof bile; for the one kind is harmless, whereas that containing a large\r\nquantity of bile, owing to the fact that it cannot be properly\r\npurified[254] in the liver, will result in the various\r\naffections--particularly jaundice--which Erasistratus himself states\r\nto occur where there is much bile. Surely, then, it is most essential\r\nfor the physician to know in the first place, that the bile is\r\ncontained in the food itself from outside, and, secondly, that for\r\nexample, beet contains a great deal of bile, and bread very little,\r\nwhile olive oil contains most, and wine least of all, and all the\r\nother articles of diet different quantities. Would it not be absurd\r\nfor any one to choose voluntarily those articles which contain more\r\nbile, rather than those containing less?\r\n\r\nWhat, however, if the bile is not contained in the food, but comes\r\ninto existence in the animal's body? Will it not also be useful to\r\nknow what _state of the body_ is followed by a greater, and what by a\r\nsmaller occurrence of bile?[255] For obviously it is in our power to\r\nalter and transmute morbid states of the body--in fact, to give them a\r\nturn for the better. But if we did not know in what respect they were\r\nmorbid or in what way they diverged from the normal, how should we be\r\nable to ameliorate them?\r\n\r\nTherefore it is not useless in treatment, as Erasistratus says, to\r\nknow the actual truth about the genesis of bile. Certainly it is not\r\nimpossible, or even difficult to discover that the reason why _honey_\r\nproduces yellow bile is not that it contains a large quantity of this\r\nwithin itself, but because it [the honey] undergoes change, becoming\r\n_altered_ and transmuted into bile. For it would be bitter to the\r\ntaste if it contained bile from the outset, and it would produce an\r\nequal quantity of bile in every person who took it. The facts,\r\nhowever, are not so.[256] For in those who are in the prime of life,\r\nespecially if they are warm by nature and are leading a life of toil,\r\nthe honey changes entirely into yellow bile. Old people, however, it\r\nsuits well enough, inasmuch as the alteration which it undergoes is\r\nnot into bile, but into blood. Erasistratus, however, in addition to\r\nknowing nothing about this, shows no intelligence even in the division\r\nof his argument; he says that it is of no practical importance to\r\ninvestigate whether the bile is contained in the food from the\r\nbeginning or comes into existence as a result of gastric digestion. He\r\nought surely to have added something about its genesis in liver and\r\nveins, seeing that the old physicians and philosophers declare that it\r\nalong with the blood is generated in these organs. But it is\r\ninevitable that people who, from the very outset, go astray, and\r\nwander from the right road, should talk such nonsense, and should,\r\nover and above this, neglect to search for the factors of most\r\npractical importance in medicine.\r\n\r\nHaving come to this point in the argument, I should like to ask those\r\nwho declare that Erasistratus was very familiar with the Peripatetics,\r\nwhether they know what Aristotle stated and demonstrated with regard\r\nto our bodies being compounded out of the Warm, the Cold, the Dry and\r\nthe Moist, and how he says that among these the Warm is the most\r\nactive, and that those animals which are by nature warmest have\r\nabundance of blood, whilst those that are colder are entirely lacking\r\nin blood, and consequently in winter lie idle and motionless, lurking\r\nin holes like corpses. Further, the question of the colour of the\r\nblood has been dealt with not only by Aristotle but also by\r\nPlato.[257] Now I, for my part, as I have already said, did not set\r\nbefore myself the task of stating what has been so well demonstrated\r\nby the Ancients, since I cannot surpass these men either in my views\r\nor in my method of giving them expression. Doctrines, however, which\r\nthey either stated without demonstration, as being self-evident (since\r\nthey never suspected that there could be sophists so degraded as to\r\ncontemn the truth in these matters), or else which they actually\r\nomitted to mention at all--these I propose to discover and prove.\r\n\r\nNow in reference to the _genesis of the humours_, I do not know that\r\nany one could add anything wiser than what has been said by\r\nHippocrates, Aristotle, Praxagoras, Philotimus[258] and many other\r\namong the Ancients. These men demonstrated that when the nutriment\r\nbecomes altered in the veins by the innate heat, blood is produced\r\nwhen it is in moderation, and the other humours when it is not in\r\nproper proportion. And all the observed facts[259] agree with this\r\nargument. Thus, those articles of food, which are by nature warmer are\r\nmore productive of bile, while those which are colder produce more\r\nphlegm. Similarly of the periods of life, those which are naturally\r\nwarmer tend more to bile, and the colder more to phlegm. Of\r\noccupations also, localities and seasons, and, above all, of\r\nnatures[260] themselves, the colder are more phlegmatic, and the\r\nwarmer more bilious. Also cold diseases result from phlegm, and warmer\r\nones from yellow bile. There is not a single thing to be found which\r\ndoes not bear witness to the truth of this account. How could it be\r\notherwise? For, seeing that every part functions in its own special\r\nway because of the manner in which the four qualities are compounded,\r\nit is absolutely necessary that the function [activity] should be\r\neither completely destroyed, or, at least hampered, by any damage to\r\nthe qualities, and that thus the animal should fall ill, either as a\r\nwhole, or in certain of its parts.\r\n\r\nAlso the diseases which are primary and most generic are four in\r\nnumber, and differ from each other in warmth, cold, dryness and\r\nmoisture. Now, Erasistratus himself confesses this, albeit\r\nunintentionally;[261] for when he says that the digestion of food\r\nbecomes worse in fever, not because the innate heat has ceased to be\r\nin due proportion, as people previously supposed, but because the\r\nstomach, with its activity impaired, cannot contract and triturate as\r\nbefore--then, I say, one may justly ask him what it is that has\r\nimpaired the activity of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThus, for example, when a bubo develops following an accidental\r\nwound[262] gastric digestion does not become impaired _until after the\r\npatient has become fevered_; neither the bubo nor the sore of itself\r\nimpedes in any way or damages the activity of the stomach. But if\r\nfever occurs, the digestion at once deteriorates, and we are also\r\nright in saying that the activity of the stomach at once becomes\r\nimpaired. We must add, however, by what it has been impaired. For the\r\nwound was not capable of impairing it, nor yet the bubo, for, if they\r\nhad been, then they would have caused this damage before the fever as\r\nwell. If it was not these that caused it, then it was the excess of\r\nheat[263] (for these two symptoms occurred besides the bubo--an\r\nalteration in the arterial and cardiac movements[264] and an excessive\r\ndevelopment of natural heat). Now the alteration of these movements\r\nwill not merely not impair the function of the stomach in any way: it\r\nwill actually prove an additional help among those animals in which,\r\naccording to Erasistratus, the _pneuma_, which is propelled through\r\nthe arteries and into the alimentary canal, is of great service in\r\ndigestion;[265] there is only left, then, the disproportionate heat to\r\naccount for the damage to the gastric activity. For the pneuma is\r\ndriven in more vigorously and continuously, and in greater quantity\r\nnow than before; thus in this case, the animal whose digestion is\r\npromoted by pneuma will digest more, whereas the remaining\r\nfactor--abnormal heat--will give them indigestion. For to say, on the\r\none hand, that the pneuma has a certain property by virtue of which it\r\npromotes digestion, and then to say that this property disappears in\r\ncases of fever, is simply to admit the absurdity. For when they are\r\nagain asked what it is that has altered the pneuma, they will only be\r\nable to reply, \"the abnormal heat,\" and particularly if it be the\r\npneuma in the food canal which is in question (since this does not\r\ncome in any way near the bubo).\r\n\r\nYet why do I mention those animals in which the property of the pneuma\r\nplays an important part, when it is possible to base one's argument\r\nupon human beings, in whom it is either of no importance at all, or\r\nacts quite faintly and feebly?[266] But Erasistratus himself agrees\r\nthat human beings digest badly in fevers, adding as the cause that the\r\nactivity of the stomach has been impaired. He cannot, however, advance\r\nany other cause of this impairment than abnormal heat. But if it is\r\nnot by accident that the abnormal heat impairs this activity, but by\r\nvirtue of its own essence and power, then this abnormal heat must\r\nbelong to the _primary diseases_. But, indeed, if _disproportion_ of\r\nheat belongs to the primary diseases, it cannot but be that a\r\n_proportionate_ blending [eucrasia] of the qualities produces the\r\nnormal activity.[267] For a disproportionate blend [dyscrasia] can\r\nonly become a cause of the primary diseases through derangement of the\r\neucrasia. That is to say, it is because the [normal] activities arise\r\nfrom the eucrasia that the primary impairments of these activities\r\nnecessarily arise from its derangement.\r\n\r\nI think, then, it has been proved to the satisfaction of those people\r\nwho are capable of seeing logical consequences, that, even according\r\nto Erasistratus's own argument, the cause of the normal functions is\r\neucrasia of the Warm.[268] Now, this being so, there is nothing\r\nfurther to prevent us from saying that, in the case of each function,\r\neucrasia is followed by the more, and dyscrasia by the less favourable\r\nalternative. And, therefore, if this be the case, we must suppose\r\nblood to be the outcome of proportionate, and yellow bile of\r\ndisproportionate heat. So we naturally find yellow bile appearing in\r\ngreatest quantity in ourselves at the warm periods of life, in warm\r\ncountries, at warm seasons of the year, and when we are in a warm\r\ncondition; similarly in people of warm temperaments, and in connection\r\nwith warm occupations, modes of life, or diseases.\r\n\r\nAnd to be in doubt as to whether this humour has its genesis in the\r\nhuman body or is contained in the food is what you would expect from\r\none who has--I will not say failed to see that, when those who are\r\nperfectly healthy have, under the compulsion of circumstances, to fast\r\ncontrary to custom, their mouths become bitter and their urine\r\nbile-coloured, while they suffer from gnawing pains in the\r\nstomach--but has, as it were, just made a sudden entrance into the\r\nworld, and is not yet familiar with the phenomena which occur there.\r\nWho, in fact, does not know that anything which is overcooked grows at\r\nfirst salt and afterwards bitter? And if you will boil honey itself,\r\nfar the sweetest of all things, you can demonstrate that even this\r\nbecomes quite bitter. For what may occur as a result of boiling in the\r\ncase of other articles which are not warm by nature, exists naturally\r\nin honey; for this reason it does not become sweeter on being boiled,\r\nsince exactly the same quantity of heat as is needed for the\r\nproduction of sweetness exists from beforehand in the honey. Therefore\r\nthe external heat, which would be useful for insufficiently warm\r\nsubstances, becomes in the honey a source of damage, in fact an\r\nexcess; and it is for this reason that honey, when boiled, can be\r\ndemonstrated to become bitter sooner than the others. For the same\r\nreason it is easily transmuted into bile in those people who are\r\nnaturally warm, or in their prime, since warm when associated with\r\nwarm becomes readily changed into a disproportionate combination and\r\nturns into bile sooner than into blood. Thus we need a cold\r\ntemperament and a cold period of life if we would have honey brought\r\nto the nature of blood.[269] Therefore Hippocrates not improperly\r\nadvised those who were naturally bilious not to take honey, since they\r\nwere obviously of too warm a temperament. So also, not only\r\nHippocrates, but all physicians say that honey is bad in bilious\r\ndiseases but good in old age; some of them having discovered this\r\nthrough the indications afforded by its nature, and others simply\r\nthrough experiment,[270] for the Empiricist physicians too have made\r\nprecisely the same observation, namely, that honey is good for an old\r\nman and not for a young one, that it is harmful for those who are\r\nnaturally bilious, and serviceable for those who are phlegmatic. In a\r\nword, in bodies which are warm either through nature, disease, time of\r\nlife, season of the year, locality, or occupation, honey is productive\r\nof bile, whereas in opposite circumstances it produces blood.\r\n\r\nBut surely it is impossible that the same article of diet can produce\r\nin certain persons bile and in others blood, if it be not that the\r\ngenesis of these humours is accomplished _in the body_. For if all\r\narticles of food contained bile from the beginning and of themselves,\r\nand did not produce it by undergoing change in the animal body, then\r\nthey would produce it similarly in all bodies; the food which was\r\nbitter to the taste would, I take it, be productive of bile, while\r\nthat which tasted good and sweet would not generate even the smallest\r\nquantity of bile. Moreover, not only honey but all other sweet\r\nsubstances are readily converted into bile in the aforesaid bodies\r\nwhich are warm for any of the reasons mentioned.\r\n\r\nWell, I have somehow or other been led into this discussion,--not in\r\naccordance with my plan, but compelled by the course of the argument.\r\nThis subject has been treated at great length by Aristotle and\r\nPraxagoras, who have correctly expounded the view of Hippocrates and\r\nPlato.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     VIII\r\n\r\n  Kai taut' ouk echrên agnoein ton Erasistraton, eiper kan\r\n  onar pote tois ek tou peripatou synetychen, hôsper oun\r\n  oude ta peri tês geneseôs tôn chymôn, hyper hôn ouden\r\n  echôn eipein oude mechri tou metriou pithanon oietai\r\n  parakrouesthai skêptomenos, hôs oude chrêsimos holôs\r\n  estin hê tôn toioutôn episkepsis. eit', ô pros theôn,\r\n  hopôs men ta sitia kata tên gastera pettetai chrêsimon\r\n  epistasthai, pôs d' en tais phlepsin hê cholê gignetai,\r\n  peritton?

As for the scientific\r\nproofs of all this, they are to be drawn from these principles of\r\nwhich I have already spoken[272]--namely, that bodies act upon and are\r\nacted upon by each other in virtue of the Warm, Cold, Moist and Dry.\r\nAnd if one is speaking of any activity, whether it be exercised by\r\nvein, liver, arteries, heart, alimentary canal, or any part, one will\r\nbe inevitably compelled to acknowledge that this activity depends upon\r\nthe way in which the four qualities are blended. Thus I should like to\r\nask the Erasistrateans why it is that the stomach contracts upon the\r\nfood, and why the veins generate blood. There is no use in recognizing\r\nthe mere fact of contraction, without also knowing the _cause_; if we\r\nknow this, we shall also be able to rectify the failures of function.\r\n\"This is no concern of ours,\" they say; \"we do not occupy ourselves\r\nwith such causes as these; they are outside the sphere of the\r\n_practitioner_,[273] and belong to that of the _scientific\r\ninvestigator_.\"[274] Are you, then, going to oppose those who maintain\r\nthat the cause of the function of every organ is a natural\r\neucrasia,[275] that the dyscrasia is itself known as a _disease_, and\r\nthat it is certainly by this that the activity becomes impaired? Or,\r\non the other hand, will you be convinced by the proofs which the\r\nancient writers furnished? Or will you take a midway course between\r\nthese two, neither perforce accepting these arguments as true nor\r\ncontradicting them as false, but suddenly becoming\r\nsceptics--Pyrrhonists, in fact? But if you do this you will have to\r\nshelter yourselves behind the Empiricist teaching. For how are you\r\ngoing to be successful in treatment, if you do not understand the real\r\nessence of each disease? Why, then, did you not call yourselves\r\nEmpiricists from the beginning? Why do you confuse us by announcing\r\nthat you are investigating natural activities with a view to\r\ntreatment? If the stomach is, in a particular case, unable to exercise\r\nits peristaltic and grinding functions, how are we going to bring it\r\nback to the normal if we do not know the _cause_ of its disability?\r\nWhat I say is[276] that we must cool the over-heated stomach and warm\r\nthe chilled one; so also we must moisten the one which has become\r\ndried up, and conversely; so, too, in combinations of these\r\nconditions; if the stomach becomes at the same time warmer and drier\r\nthan normally, the first principle of treatment is at once to chill\r\nand moisten it; and if it become colder and moister, it must be warmed\r\nand dried; so also in other cases. But how on earth are the followers\r\nof Erasistratus going to act, confessing as they do that they make no\r\nsort of investigation into the cause of disease? For the fruit of the\r\nenquiry into activities is that by knowing the causes of the\r\ndyscrasiae one may bring them back to the normal, since it is of no\r\nuse for the purposes of treatment merely to know what the activity of\r\neach organ is.\r\n\r\nNow, it seems to me that Erasistratus is unaware of this fact also,\r\nthat the actual disease is that condition of the body which, not\r\naccidentally, but primarily and of itself, impairs the normal\r\nfunction. How, then, is he going to diagnose or cure diseases if he is\r\nentirely ignorant of what they are, and of what kind and number? As\r\nregards the stomach, certainly, Erasistratus held that one should at\r\nleast investigate _how_ it digests the food. But why was not\r\ninvestigation also made as to the primary originative cause of this?\r\nAnd, as regards the veins and the blood, he omitted even to ask the\r\nquestion \"_how?_\"\r\n\r\nYet neither Hippocrates nor any of the other physicians or\r\nphilosophers whom I mentioned a short while ago thought it right to\r\nomit this; they say that when the heat which exists naturally in every\r\nanimal is well blended and moderately moist it generates blood; for\r\nthis reason they also say that the blood is a _virtually_ warm and\r\nmoist humour, and similarly also that yellow bile is warm and dry,\r\neven though for the most part it appears moist. (For in them the\r\n_apparently_ dry would seem to differ from the _virtually_ dry.) Who\r\ndoes not know that brine and sea-water preserve meat and keep it\r\nuncorrupted,[277] whilst all other water--the drinkable kind--readily\r\nspoils and rots it? And who does not know that when yellow bile is\r\ncontained in large quantity in the stomach, we are troubled with an\r\nunquenchable thirst, and that when we vomit this up, we at once become\r\nmuch freer from thirst than if we had drunk very large quantities of\r\nfluid? Therefore this humour has been very properly termed warm, and\r\nalso virtually dry. And, similarly, _phlegm_ has been called cold and\r\nmoist; for about this also clear proofs have been given by Hippocrates\r\nand the other Ancients.\r\n\r\nProdicus[278] also, when in his book \"On the Nature of Man\" he gives\r\nthe name \"phlegm\" (from the verb [Greek: pephlechthai]) to that\r\nelement in the humours which has been burned or, as it were,\r\nover-roasted, while using a different terminology, still keeps to the\r\nfact just as the others do; this man's innovations in nomenclature\r\nhave also been amply done justice to by Plato.[279] Thus, the\r\nwhite-coloured substance which everyone else calls _phlegm_, and which\r\nProdicus calls _blenna_ [mucus],[280] is the well-known cold, moist\r\nhumour which collects mostly in old people and in those who have been\r\nchilled[281] in some way, and not even a lunatic could say that this\r\nwas anything else than cold and moist.\r\n\r\nIf, then, there is a warm and moist humour, and another which is warm\r\nand dry, and yet another which is moist and cold, is there none which\r\nis virtually _cold and dry_? Is the fourth combination of\r\ntemperaments, which exists in all other things, non-existent in the\r\nhumours alone? No; the _black bile_ is such a humour. This, according\r\nto intelligent physicians and philosophers, tends to be in excess, as\r\nregards seasons, mainly in the fall of the year, and, as regards ages,\r\nmainly after the prime of life. And, similarly, also they say that\r\nthere are cold and dry modes of life, regions, constitutions, and\r\ndiseases. Nature, they suppose, is not defective in this single\r\ncombination like the three other combinations, it extends everywhere.\r\n\r\nAt this point, also, I would gladly have been able to ask Erasistratus\r\nwhether his \"artistic\" Nature has not constructed any organ for\r\n_clearing away_ a humour such as this. For whilst there are two organs\r\nfor the excretion of urine, and another of considerable size for that\r\nof yellow bile, does the humour which is more pernicious than these\r\nwander about persistently in the veins mingled with the blood? Yet\r\nHippocrates says, \"Dysentery is a fatal condition if it proceeds from\r\nblack bile\"; while that proceeding from yellow bile is by no means\r\ndeadly, and most people recover from it; this proves how much more\r\npernicious and acrid in its potentialities is black than yellow bile.\r\nHas Erasistratus, then, not read the book, \"On the Nature of Man,\" any\r\nmore than any of the rest of Hippocrates's writings, that he so\r\ncarelessly passes over the consideration of the humours? Or, does he\r\nknow it, and yet voluntarily neglect one of the finest studies[282] in\r\nmedicine? Thus he ought not to have said anything about the\r\n_spleen_,[283] nor have stultified himself by holding that an artistic\r\nNature would have prepared so large an organ for no purpose. As a\r\nmatter of fact, not only Hippocrates and Plato--who are no less\r\nauthorities on Nature than is Erasistratus--say that this viscus also\r\nis one of those which cleanse the blood, but there are thousands of\r\nthe ancient physicians and philosophers as well who are in agreement\r\nwith them. Now, all of these the high and mighty Erasistratus affected\r\nto despise, and he neither contradicted them nor even so much as\r\nmentioned their opinion. Hippocrates, indeed, says that the spleen\r\nwastes in those people in whom the body is in good condition, and all\r\nthose physicians also who base themselves on experience[284] agree\r\nwith this. Again, in those cases in which the spleen is large and is\r\nincreasing from internal suppuration, it destroys the body and fills\r\nit with evil humours;[285] this again is agreed on, not only by\r\nHippocrates, but also by Plato and many others, including the Empiric\r\nphysicians. And the jaundice which occurs when the spleen is out of\r\norder is darker in colour, and the cicatrices of ulcers are dark. For,\r\ngenerally speaking, when the spleen is drawing the atrabiliary[286]\r\nhumour into itself to a less degree than is proper, the blood is\r\nunpurified, and the whole body takes on a bad colour. And when does it\r\ndraw this in to a less degree than proper? Obviously, when it [the\r\nspleen] is in a bad condition. Thus, just as the kidneys, whose\r\nfunction it is to attract the urine, do this badly when they are out\r\nof order, so also the spleen, which has in itself a native power of\r\nattracting an atrabiliary quality,[287] if it ever happens to be weak,\r\nmust necessarily exercise this attraction badly, with the result that\r\nthe blood becomes thicker and darker.\r\n\r\nNow all these points, affording as they do the greatest help in the\r\ndiagnosis and in the cure of disease were entirely passed over by\r\nErasistratus, and he pretended to despise these great men--he who does\r\nnot despise ordinary people, but always jealously attacks the most\r\nabsurd doctrines. Hence, it was clearly because he had nothing to say\r\nagainst the statements made by the ancients regarding the function and\r\nutility of the spleen, and also because he could discover nothing new\r\nhimself, that he ended by saying nothing at all. I, however, for my\r\npart, have demonstrated, firstly from the _causes_ by which everything\r\nthroughout nature is governed (by the causes I mean the Warm, Cold,\r\nDry and Moist) and secondly, from obvious bodily phenomena, that there\r\nmust needs be a cold and dry humour.[288] And having in the next place\r\ndrawn attention to the fact that this humour is black bile\r\n[atrabiliary] and that the viscus which clears it away is the\r\nspleen--having pointed this out by help of as few as possible of the\r\nproofs given by ancient writers, I shall now proceed to what remains\r\nof the subject in hand.\r\n\r\nWhat else, then, remains but to explain clearly what it is that\r\nhappens in the generation of the humours, according to the belief and\r\ndemonstration of the Ancients? This will be more clearly understood\r\nfrom a comparison. Imagine, then, some new wine which has been not\r\nlong ago pressed from the grape, and which is fermenting and\r\nundergoing _alteration_ through the agency of its contained heat.[289]\r\nImagine next two residual substances produced during this process of\r\nalteration, the one tending to be light and air-like and the other to\r\nbe heavy and more of the nature of earth; of these the one, as I\r\nunderstand, they call the _flower_ and the other the _lees_. Now you\r\nmay correctly compare yellow bile to the first of these, and black\r\nbile to the latter, although these humours have not the same\r\nappearance when the animal is in normal health as that which they\r\noften show when it is not so; for then the yellow bile becomes\r\n_vitelline_,[290] being so termed because it becomes like the yolk of\r\nan egg, both in colour and density; and again, even the black bile\r\nitself becomes much more malignant than when in its normal\r\ncondition,[291] but no particular name has been given to [such a\r\ncondition of] the humour, except that some people have called it\r\n_corrosive_ or _acetose_, because it also becomes sharp like vinegar\r\nand corrodes the animal's body--as also the earth, if it be poured out\r\nupon it--and it produces a kind of fermentation and seething,\r\naccompanied by bubbles--an abnormal putrefaction having become added\r\nto the natural condition of the black humour. It seems to me also that\r\nmost of the ancient physicians give the name _black humour_ and not\r\n_black bile_ to the normal portion of this humour, which is discharged\r\nfrom the bowel and which also frequently rises to the top [of the\r\nstomach-contents]; and they call _black bile_ that part which, through\r\na kind of combustion and putrefaction, has had its quality changed to\r\nacid. There is no need, however, to dispute about names, but we must\r\nrealise the facts, which are as follow:--\r\n\r\nIn the genesis of blood, everything in the nutriment[292] which\r\nbelongs naturally to the thick and earth-like part of the food,[292]\r\nand which does not take on well the alteration produced by the innate\r\nheat--all this the spleen draws into itself. On the other hand, that\r\npart of the nutriment which is roasted, so to speak, or burnt (this\r\nwill be the warmest and sweetest part of it, like honey and fat),\r\nbecomes _yellow bile_, and is cleared away through the so-called\r\nbiliary[293] vessels; now, this is thin, moist, and fluid, not like\r\nwhat it is when, having been roasted to an _excessive_ degree, it\r\nbecomes yellow, fiery, and thick, like the yolk of eggs; for this\r\nlatter is already abnormal, while the previously mentioned state is\r\nnatural. Similarly with the black humour: that which does not yet\r\nproduce, as I say, this seething and fermentation on the ground, is\r\nnatural, while that which has taken over this character and faculty is\r\nunnatural; it has assumed an acridity owing to the combustion caused\r\nby abnormal heat, and has practically become transformed into\r\nashes.[294] In somewhat the same way burned lees differ from unburned.\r\nThe former is a warm substance, able to burn, dissolve, and destroy\r\nthe flesh. The other kind, which has not yet undergone combustion, one\r\nmay find the physicians employing for the same purposes that one uses\r\nthe so-called _potter's earth_ and other substances which have\r\nnaturally a combined drying and chilling action.\r\n\r\nNow the vitelline bile also may take on the appearance of this\r\ncombusted black bile, if ever it chance to be roasted, so to say, by\r\nfiery heat. And all the other forms of bile are produced, some from a\r\nblending of those mentioned, others being, as it were,\r\ntransition-stages in the genesis of these or in their conversion into\r\none another. And they differ in that those first mentioned are unmixed\r\nand unique, while the latter forms are diluted with various kinds of\r\n_serum_. And all the serums in the humours are waste substances, and\r\nthe animal body needs to be purified from them. There is, however, a\r\nnatural use for the humours first mentioned, both thick and thin; the\r\nblood is purified both by the spleen and by the bladder beside the\r\nliver, and a part of each of the two humours is put away, of such\r\nquantity and quality that, if it were carried all over the body, it\r\nwould do a certain amount of harm. For that which is decidedly thick\r\nand earthy in nature, and has entirely escaped alteration in the\r\nliver, is drawn by the spleen into itself[295]; the other part which\r\nis only moderately thick, after being elaborated [in the liver], is\r\ncarried all over the body. For the blood in many parts of the body has\r\nneed of a certain amount of thickening, as also, I take it, of the\r\n_fibres_ which it contains. And the use of these has been discussed by\r\nPlato,[296] and it will also be discussed by me in such of my\r\ntreatises as may deal with the use of parts. And the blood also needs,\r\nnot least, the yellow humour, which has as yet not reached the extreme\r\nstage of combustion; in the treatises mentioned it will be pointed out\r\nwhat purpose is subserved by this.\r\n\r\nNow Nature has made no organ for clearing away _phlegm_, this being\r\ncold and moist, and, as it were, half-digested nutriment; such a\r\nsubstance, therefore, does not need to be evacuated, but remains in\r\nthe body and undergoes _alteration_ there. And perhaps one cannot\r\nproperly give the name of _phlegm_ to the surplus-substance which runs\r\ndown from the brain,[297] but one should call it _mucus_ [blenna] or\r\n_coryza_--as, in fact, it is actually termed; in any case it will be\r\npointed out, in the treatise \"On the Use of Parts,\" how Nature has\r\nprovided for the evacuation of this substance. Further, the device\r\nprovided by Nature which ensures that the phlegm which forms in the\r\nstomach and intestines may be evacuated in the most rapid and\r\neffective way possible--this also will be described in that\r\ncommentary. As to that portion of the phlegm which is carried in the\r\nveins, seeing that this is of service to the animal it requires no\r\nevacuation. Here too, then, we must pay attention and recognise that,\r\njust as in the case of each of the two kinds of bile, there is one\r\npart which is useful to the animal and in accordance with its nature,\r\nwhile the other part is useless and contrary to nature, so also is it\r\nwith the phlegm; such of it as is sweet is useful to the animal and\r\naccording to nature, while, as to such of it as has become bitter or\r\nsalt, that part which is bitter is completely undigested, while that\r\npart which is salt has undergone putrefaction. And the term \"_complete\r\nindigestion_\" refers of course to the second digestion--that which\r\ntakes place in the veins; it is not a failure of the first\r\ndigestion--that in the alimentary canal--for it would not have become\r\na humour at the outset if it had escaped this digestion also.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that I have made enough reference to what has been said\r\nregarding the genesis and destruction of humours by Hippocrates,\r\nPlato, Aristotle, Praxagoras, and Diocles, and many others among the\r\nAncients; I did not deem it right to transport the whole of their\r\nfinal pronouncements into this treatise. I have said only so much\r\nregarding each of the humours as will stir up the reader, unless he be\r\nabsolutely inept, to make himself familiar with the writings of the\r\nAncients, and will help him to gain more easy access to them. In\r\nanother treatise[298] I have written on the humours according to\r\nPraxagoras, son of Nicarchus; although this authority makes as many as\r\nten humours, not including the blood (the blood itself being an\r\neleventh), this is not a departure from the teaching of Hippocrates;\r\nfor Praxagoras divides into species and varieties the humours which\r\nHippocrates first mentioned, with the demonstration proper to each.\r\n\r\nThose, then, are to be praised who explain the points which have been\r\nduly mentioned, as also those who add what has been left out; for it\r\nis not possible for the same man to make both a beginning and an end.\r\nThose, on the other hand, deserve censure who are so impatient that\r\nthey will not wait to learn any of the things which have been duly\r\nmentioned, as do also those who are so ambitious that, in their lust\r\nafter novel doctrines, they are always attempting some fraudulent\r\nsophistry, either purposely neglecting certain subjects, as\r\nErasistratus does in the case of the humours, or unscrupulously\r\nattacking other people, as does this same writer, as well as many of\r\nthe more recent authorities.\r\n\r\nBut let this discussion come to an end here, and I shall add in the\r\nthird book all that remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IX\r\n\r\n  Mê toinyn hôs apodeixeis hyph' hêmôn eirêsthai nomizein\r\n  ta toiauta mallon ê peri tês tôn allôs gignôskontôn\r\n  anaisthêsias endeixeis, hoi mêde ta pros hapantôn\r\n  homologoumena kai kath' hekastên hêmeran phainomena\r\n  gignôskousin;

_cf._ p. 13, note 5 (26).\r\n\r\n    [171] The term [Greek: koilia] is used both specifically\r\n    for the stomach proper and also (as probably here) in a\r\n    somewhat wider sense for the stomach _region_, including\r\n    the adjacent part of the small intestine; this was the\r\n    part of the alimentary canal from which nutriment was\r\n    believed to be absorbed by the mesenteric veins; _cf._\r\n    p. 309, note 2 (382).\r\n\r\n    [172] _cf._ p. 100, note 2 (152);

p. 13, note 5 (26).\r\n\r\n    [176] What we now call the pulmonary artery. Galen\r\n    believed that the right ventricle existed for the\r\n    purpose of sending nutrient blood to the lungs.\r\n\r\n    [177] Lit. owing to the ongrowth (_epiphysis_) of\r\n    membranes; he means the tricuspid valve; _cf._ p. 314,\r\n    note 2 (387); p. 321, note 4 (398).\r\n\r\n    [178] Horror vacui.\r\n\r\n    [179] But Erasistratus had never upheld this in the case\r\n    of urinary secretion, _cf._ p. 99.\r\n\r\n    [180] This was the characteristically \"anatomical\"\r\n    explanation of bile-secretion made by Erasistratus.\r\n    _cf._ p. 170, note 2 (241). Why, then, says Galen, does not\r\n    urine, rather than bile, enter the bile-ducts?\r\n\r\n    [181] Urine, or, more exactly, blood-serum.\r\n\r\n    [182] Or ducts, canals, conduits, _i.e._ _morphological_\r\n    factors.\r\n\r\n    [183] Or artistic skill, \"artistry.\" _cf._ Book I.,\r\n    chap. xii.\r\n\r\n    [184] \"Only\"; _cf._ Introd., p. xxviii.\r\n\r\n    [185] Note how Galen, although he has not yet clearly\r\n    differentiated physiological from physical processes\r\n    (both are \"natural\") yet separates them definitely from\r\n    the psychical. _cf._ p. 2, footnote (5). A _psychical_\r\n    function or activity is, in Latin, _actio animalis_\r\n    (from _anima_ = _psyche_).\r\n\r\n    [186] The stage of organogenesis or _diaplasis_; cf. p.\r\n    25, note 4 (49).\r\n\r\n    [187] The spermatozoon now becomes an \"organism\" proper.\r\n\r\n    [188] Galen attributed to the sperma or semen what we\r\n    should to the fertilized ovum: to him the maternal\r\n    contribution is purely passive--mere food for the sperm.\r\n    The epoch-making Ovum Theory was not developed till the\r\n    seventeenth century. _cf._ p. 19, note 3 (34).\r\n\r\n    [189] _i.e._ we should be talking psychology, not\r\n    biology; _cf._ stomach, p. 307, note 3 (380).\r\n\r\n    [190] Attraction now described not merely as\r\n    _qualitative_ but also as _quantitative_. _cf._ p. 85,\r\n    note 3 (130).\r\n\r\n    [191] He still tends either to biologize physics, or to\r\n    physicize biology--whichever way we prefer to look at\r\n    it. _cf._ Book I., chap. xiv.\r\n\r\n    [192] Aristotelian and Stoic duality of an active and a\r\n    passive principle.\r\n\r\n    [193] Note that early embryonic development is described\r\n    as a process of _nutrition_. _cf._ p. 130, note 2 (188).\r\n\r\n    [194] On the _alterative_ and _shaping_ faculties _cf._\r\n    p. 18, note 1 (32).\r\n\r\n    [195] pp. 27-29.\r\n\r\n    [196] _cf._ Introduction, p. xxvi.\r\n\r\n    [197] _cf._ p. 15.\r\n\r\n    [198] For definitions of _alteration_ and _mingling_\r\n    (_crasis_, \"temperament\") _cf._ Book I., chaps. ii. and\r\n    iii.\r\n\r\n    [199] _i.e._ are associated with oxidation? _cf._ p. 41,\r\n    note 3 (70).\r\n\r\n    [200] \"Useless\" organs; _cf._ p. 56, note 2 (91).

The\r\n    question Galen now asks is whether this vessel is a\r\n    \"unit mass of living matter,\" or merely an agglomeration\r\n    of _atoms_ subject to mechanical law. _cf._ Galen's\r\n    \"fibres,\" p. 329.\r\n\r\n    [217] _cf._ Book I., chap. xii.\r\n\r\n    [218] _i.e._ in biology we must begin with living\r\n    substance--with something which is specifically\r\n    alive--here with the \"unit mass of living matter.\" _cf._\r\n    p. 73, note 3 (119).\r\n\r\n    [219] \"Ad elementa quae nec coalescere possunt nec in\r\n    partes dividi\" (Linacre).

It was also shown that a sufficient supply of the matter\r\nwhich the part being nourished makes into nutriment for itself is\r\nensured by virtue of another faculty which naturally attracts its\r\n_proper juice_ [humour] that that juice is proper to each part which\r\nis adapted for assimilation, and that the faculty which attracts the\r\njuice is called, by reason of its activity, _attractive_ or\r\n_epispastic_.[300] It has also been shown that assimilation is\r\npreceded by _adhesion_, and this, again, by _presentation_,[301] the\r\nlatter stage being, as one might say, the end or goal of the activity\r\ncorresponding to the attractive faculty. For the actual bringing up of\r\nnutriment from the veins into each of the parts takes place through\r\nthe activation of the attractive faculty,[302] whilst to have been\r\nfinally brought up and presented to the part is the actual end for\r\nwhich we desired such an activity; it is attracted in order that it\r\nmay be presented. After this, considerable time is needed for the\r\nnutrition of the animal; whilst a thing may be even rapidly attracted,\r\non the other hand to become adherent, altered, and entirely\r\nassimilated to the part which is being nourished and to become a part\r\nof it, cannot take place suddenly, but requires a considerable amount\r\nof time. But if the nutritive juice, so presented, does not remain in\r\nthe part, but withdraws to another one, and keeps flowing away, and\r\nconstantly changing and shifting its position, neither adhesion nor\r\ncomplete assimilation will take place in any of them. Here too, then,\r\nthe [animal's] nature has need of some other faculty for ensuring a\r\nprolonged stay of the presented juice at the part, and this not a\r\nfaculty which comes in from somewhere outside but one which is\r\nresident in the part which is to be nourished. This faculty, again, in\r\nview of its activity our predecessors were obliged to call\r\n_retentive_.\r\n\r\nThus our argument has clearly shown[303] the necessity for the genesis\r\nof such a faculty, and whoever has an appreciation of logical sequence\r\nmust be firmly persuaded from what we have said that, if it be laid\r\ndown and proved by previous demonstration that Nature is artistic and\r\nsolicitous for the animal's welfare, it necessarily follows that she\r\nmust also possess a faculty of this kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BOOK III\r\n\r\n                        G\r\n\r\n\r\n                        I\r\n\r\n  Hoti men oun hê threpsis alloioumenou te kai                  143\r\n  homoioumenou gignetai tou trephontos tô trephomenô kai\r\n  hôs en hekastô tôn tou zôou moriôn esti tis dynamis, hên\r\n  apo tês energeias alloiôtikên men kata genos,\r\n  homoiôtikên de kai threptikên kat' eidos onomazomen, en\r\n  tô prosthen dedêlôtai logô. tên d' euporian tês hylês,\r\n  hên trophên heautô poieitai to trephomenon, ex heteras\r\n  tinos echein edeiknyto dynameôs epispasthai pephykuias\r\n  ton oikeion chymon, einai d' oikeion hekastô tôn moriôn\r\n  chymon, hos an || epitêdeios eis tên exomoiôsin ê, kai        144\r\n  tên helkousan auton dynamin apo tês energeias helktikên\r\n  te tina kai epispastikên onomazesthai. dedeiktai de kai,\r\n  hôs pro men tês homoiôseôs hê prosphysis estin, ekeinês\r\n  d' emprosthen hê prosthesis gignetai, telos, hôs an\r\n  eipoi tis, ousa tês kata tên epispastikên dynamin\r\n  energeias. auto men gar to paragesthai tên trophên ek\r\n  tôn phlebôn eis hekaston tôn moriôn tês helktikês\r\n  energousês gignetai dynameôs, to d' êdê parêchthai te\r\n  kai prostithesthai tô moriô to telos estin auto, di' ho\r\n  kai tês toiautês energeias edeêthêmen; hina gar\r\n  prostethê, dia touth' helketai. chronou d' enteuthen êdê\r\n  pleionos eis tên threpsin tou zôou dei; helchthênai men\r\n  gar kai dia tacheôn ti dynatai, prosphynai de kai\r\n  alloiôthênai kai teleôs homoiôthênai tô trephomenô kai\r\n  meros autou genesthai parachrêma men ouch hoion te,\r\n  chronô d' an pleioni symbainoi kalôs. all' ei mê menoi\r\n  kata to meros ho prostetheis houtos chymos, eis heteron\r\n  de ti methistaito kai pararrheoi dia pantos ameibôn te\r\n  kai hypallattôn ta chôria, kat' ouden autôn || oute           145\r\n  prosphysis out' exomoiôsis estai. dei de kantautha tinos\r\n  tê physei dynameôs heteras eis polychronion monên tou\r\n  prostethentos tô moriô chymou kai tautês ouk exôthen\r\n  pothen epirrheousês all' en autô tô threpsomenô\r\n  katôkismenês, hên apo tês energeias palin hoi pro hêmôn\r\n  ênankasthêsan onomasai kathektikên.\r\n\r\n  Ho men dê logos êdê saphôs enedeixato tên anankên tês\r\n  geneseôs tês toiautês dynameôs kai hostis akolouthias\r\n  synesin echei, pepeistai bebaiôs ex hôn eipomen, hôs\r\n  hypokeimenou te kai proapodedeigmenou tou technikên\r\n  einai tên physin kai tou zôou kêdemonikên anankaion\r\n  hyparchein autê kai tên toiautên dynamin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              II\r\n\r\nSince, however, it is not our habit to employ this kind of\r\ndemonstration[304] alone, but to add thereto cogent and compelling\r\nproofs drawn from obvious facts, we will also proceed to the latter\r\nkind in the present instance: we will demonstrate that in certain\r\nparts of the body _the retentive faculty_ is so obvious that its\r\noperation can be actually recognised by the _senses_, whilst in other\r\nparts it is less obvious to the senses, but is capable even here of\r\nbeing detected by the _argument_.[305]\r\n\r\nLet us begin our exposition, then, by first dealing systematically for\r\na while with certain definite parts of the body, in reference to which\r\nwe may accurately test and enquire what sort of thing the retentive\r\nfaculty is.\r\n\r\nNow, could one begin the enquiry in any better way than with the\r\nlargest and hollowest organs? Personally I do not think one could. It\r\nis to be expected that in these, owing to their size, the activities\r\nwill show quite clearly, whereas with respect to the small organs,\r\neven if they possess a strong faculty of this kind, its activation\r\nwill not at once be recognisable to sense.\r\n\r\nNow those parts of the animal which are especially hollow and large\r\nare the stomach and the organ which is called the womb or uterus.[306]\r\nWhat prevents us, then, from taking up these first and considering\r\ntheir activities, conducting the enquiry on our own persons in\r\nregard to those activities which are obvious without dissection, and,\r\nin the case of those which are more obscure, dissecting animals which\r\nare near to man;[307] not that even animals unlike him will not show,\r\nin a general way, the faculty in question, but because in this manner\r\nwe may find out at once what is common to all and what is peculiar to\r\nourselves, and so may become more resourceful in the diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of disease.\r\n\r\nNow it is impossible to speak of both organs at once, so we shall deal\r\nwith each in turn, beginning with the one which is capable of\r\ndemonstrating the retentive faculty most plainly. For the stomach\r\nretains the food until it has quite digested it, and the uterus\r\nretains the embryo until it brings it to completion, but the time\r\ntaken for the completion of the embryo is many times more than that\r\nfor the digestion of food.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       II\r\n\r\n  All' hêmeis ou toutô monô tô genei tês apodeixeôs\r\n  eithismenoi chrêsthai, prostithentes d' autô kai tas ek\r\n  tôn enargôs phainomenôn anankazousas te kai biazomenas\r\n  pisteis epi tas toiautas kai nyn aphixometha kai\r\n  deixomen epi men tinôn moriôn tou sômatos houtôs enargê\r\n  tên kathektikên dynamin, hôs autais tais aisthêsesi ||        146\r\n  diagignôskesthai tên energeian autês, epi de tinôn\r\n  hêtton men enargôs tais aisthêsesi, logô de kantautha\r\n  phôrathênai dynamenên.\r\n\r\n  Arxômeth' oun tês didaskalias ap' autou tou teôs prôton\r\n  methodô tini procheirisasthai mori' atta tou sômatos,\r\n  eph' hôn akribôs esti basanisai te kai zêtêsai tên\r\n  kathektikên dynamin hopoia pot' estin.\r\n\r\n  Ar' oun ameinon an tis heterôthen ê apo tôn megistôn te\r\n  kai koilotatôn organôn hyparxaito tês zêtêseôs? emoi men\r\n  oun ouk an dokei beltion. enargeis goun eikos epi toutôn\r\n  phanênai tas energeias dia to megethos; hôs ta ge smikra\r\n  tach' an, ei kai sphodran echei tên toiautên dynamin,\r\n  all' ouk aisthêsei g' hetoimên diagignôskesthai tên\r\n  energeian autês.\r\n\r\n  All' estin en tois malista koilotata kai megista tôn tou\r\n  zôou moriôn hê te gastêr kai <hai> mêtrai te kai hysterai\r\n  kaloumenai. ti oun kôlyei tauta prôta procheirisamenous\r\n  episkepsasthai tas energeias autôn, hosai men kai pro\r\n  tês anatomês dêlai, tên exetasin eph' hêmôn autôn\r\n  poioumenous, hosai d' amydroterai, ta paraplêsia\r\n  diairountas anthrôpô zôa, || ouch hôs ouk an hikanôs to       147\r\n  ge katholou peri tês zêtoumenês dynameôs kai tôn\r\n  anomoiôn endeixomenôn, all' hôs hin' hama tô koinô kai\r\n  to idion eph' hêmôn autôn egnôkotes eis te tas\r\n  diagnôseis tôn nosêmatôn kai tas iaseis euporôteroi\r\n  gignômetha.\r\n\r\n  Peri men oun amphoterôn tôn organôn hama legein\r\n  adynaton, en merei d' hyper hekaterou poiêsometha ton\r\n  logon apo tou saphesteron endeixasthai dynamenou tên\r\n  kathektikên dynamin arxamenoi. katechei men gar kai hê\r\n  gastêr ta sitia, mechri per an ekpepsê, katechousi de\r\n  kai hai mêtrai to embryon, est' an teleiôsôsin; alla\r\n  pollaplasios estin ho tês tôn embryôn teleiôseôs chronos\r\n  tês tôn sitiôn pepseôs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           III\r\n\r\nWe may expect, then, to detect the retentive faculty in the uterus\r\nmore clearly in proportion to the longer duration of its activity as\r\ncompared with that of the stomach. For, as we know, it takes nine\r\nmonths in most women for the foetus to attain maturity in the womb,\r\nthis organ having its neck quite closed, and entirely surrounding the\r\nembryo together with the _chorion_. Further, it is the utility of the\r\nfunction which determines the closure of the os and the stay of the\r\nfoetus in the uterus. For it is not casually nor without reason that\r\nNature has made the uterus capable of contracting upon, and of\r\nretaining the embryo, but in order that the latter may arrive at a\r\nproper size. When, therefore, the object for which the uterus brought\r\nits retentive faculty into play has been fulfilled, it then stops this\r\nfaculty and brings it back to a state of rest, and employs instead of\r\nit another faculty hitherto quiescent--the _propulsive_ faculty. In\r\nthis case again the quiescent and active states are both determined by\r\nutility; when this calls, there is activity; when it does not, there\r\nis rest.\r\n\r\nHere, then, once more, we must observe well the Art [artistic\r\ntendency] of Nature--how she has not merely placed in each organ the\r\ncapabilities of useful activities, but has also fore-ordained the\r\ntimes both of rest and movement. For when everything connected with\r\nthe pregnancy proceeds properly, the _eliminative_ faculty remains\r\nquiescent as though it did not exist, but if anything goes wrong in\r\nconnection either with the chorion or any of the other membranes or\r\nwith the foetus itself, and its completion is entirely despaired of,\r\nthen the uterus no longer awaits the nine-months period, but the\r\nretentive faculty forthwith ceases and allows the heretofore\r\ninoperative faculty to come into action. Now it is that something is\r\ndone--in fact, useful work effected--by the _eliminative or propulsive\r\nfaculty_ (for so it, too, has been called, receiving, like the rest,\r\nits names from the corresponding activities).\r\n\r\nFurther, our theory can, I think, demonstrate both together; for\r\nseeing that they succeed each other, and that the one keeps giving\r\nplace to the other according as utility demands, it seems not\r\nunreasonable to accept a common demonstration also for both. Thus it\r\nis the work of the retentive faculty to make the uterus contract upon\r\nthe foetus at every point, so that, naturally enough, when the\r\nmidwives palpate it, the os is found to be closed, whilst the pregnant\r\nwomen themselves, during the first days--and particularly on that on\r\nwhich conception takes place--experience a sensation as if the uterus\r\nwere moving and contracting upon itself. Now, if both of these things\r\noccur--if the os closes apart from inflammation or any other disease,\r\nand if this is accompanied by a feeling of movement in the\r\nuterus--then the women believe that they have received the semen which\r\ncomes from the male, and that they are retaining it.\r\n\r\nNow we are not inventing this for ourselves: one may say the statement\r\nis based on prolonged experience of those who occupy themselves with\r\nsuch matters. Thus Herophilus[308] does not hesitate to state in his\r\nwritings that up to the time of labour the os uteri will not admit so\r\nmuch as the tip of a probe, that it no longer opens to the slightest\r\ndegree if pregnancy has begun--that, in fact, it dilates more widely\r\nat the times of the menstrual flow. With him are in agreement all the\r\nothers who have applied themselves to this subject; and particularly\r\nHippocrates, who was the first of all physicians and philosophers to\r\ndeclare that the os uteri closes during pregnancy and inflammation,\r\nalbeit in pregnancy it does not depart from its own nature, whilst in\r\ninflammation it becomes hard.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the opposite (the eliminative) faculty, the os opens,\r\nwhilst the whole fundus approaches as near as possible to the os,\r\nexpelling the embryo as it does so; and along with the fundus the\r\ncontiguous parts--which form as it were a girdle round the whole\r\norgan--co-operate in the work; they squeeze upon the embryo and propel\r\nit bodily outwards. And, in many women who exercise such a faculty\r\nimmoderately, violent pains cause forcible prolapse of the whole womb;\r\nhere almost the same thing happens as frequently occurs in\r\nwrestling-bouts and struggles, when in our eagerness to overturn and\r\nthrow others we are ourselves upset along with them; for similarly\r\nwhen the uterus is forcing the embryo forward it sometimes becomes\r\nentirely prolapsed, and particularly when the ligaments connecting it\r\nwith the spine happen to be naturally lax.[309]\r\n\r\nA wonderful device of Nature's also is this--that, when the foetus is\r\nalive, the os uteri is closed with perfect accuracy, but if it dies,\r\nthe os at once opens up to the extent which is necessary for the\r\nfoetus to make its exit. The midwife, however, does not make the\r\nparturient woman get up at once and sit down on the [obstetric] chair,\r\nbut she begins by palpating the os as it gradually dilates, and the\r\nfirst thing she says is that it has dilated \"enough to admit the\r\nlittle finger,\" then that \"it is bigger now,\" and as we make enquiries\r\nfrom time to time, she answers that the size of the dilatation is\r\nincreasing. And when it is sufficient to allow of the transit of the\r\nfoetus,[310] she then makes the patient get up from her bed and sit on\r\nthe chair, and bids her make every effort to expel the child. Now,\r\nthis additional work which the patient does of herself is no longer\r\nthe work of the uterus but of the epigastric muscles, which also help\r\nus in defaecation and micturition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      III\r\n\r\n  Eikos oun kai tên dynamin enargesteron en tais mêtrais\r\n  phôrasein hêmas tên kathektikên, hosô kai\r\n  polychroniôteran tês gastros tên energeian kektêtai.\r\n  mêsi gar ennea pou tais pleistais tôn gynaikôn en autais\r\n  teleioutai ta kyêmata, memykuiais men hapanti tô\r\n  aucheni, periechousais de pantachothen auta syn tô\r\n  choriô. || kai peras ge tês tou stomatos myseôs kai tês       148\r\n  tou kyoumenou kata tas mêtras monês hê chreia tês\r\n  energeias estin; ou gar hôs etychen oud' alogôs hikanas\r\n  peristellesthai kai katechein to embryon hê physis\r\n  apeirgasato tas hysteras, all' hin' eis to prepon\r\n  aphikêtai megethos to kyoumenon. hotan oun, hou charin\r\n  enêrgoun tê kathektikê dynamei, sympeplêrômenon ê,\r\n  tautên men anepausan te kai eis êremian epanêgagon, ant'\r\n  autês d' hetera chrôntai tê teôs hêsychazousê, tê\r\n  proôstikê. ên d' ara kai tês ekeinês hêsychias horos hê\r\n  chreia kai tês g' energeias hôsautôs hê chreia; kalousês\r\n  men gar autês energei, mê kalousês d' hêsychazei.\r\n\r\n  Kai chrê palin kantautha katamathein tês physeôs tên\r\n  technên, hôs ou monon energeiôn chrêsimôn dynameis\r\n  enethêken hekastô tôn organôn, alla kai tou tôn\r\n  hêsychiôn te kai kinêseôn kairou prounoêsato. kalôs men\r\n  gar hapantôn gignomenôn tôn kata tên kyêsin hê\r\n  apokritikê dynamis hêsychazei teleôs hôsper ouk ousa,\r\n  kakopragias de tinos genomenês ê peri to chorion ê peri\r\n  tina tôn allôn || hymenôn ê peri to kyoumenon auto kai        149\r\n  tês teleiôseôs autou pantapasin apognôstheisês ouket'\r\n  anamenousi ton enneamênon hai mêtrai chronon, all' hê\r\n  men kathektikê dynamis autika dê pepautai kai parachôrei\r\n  kineisthai tê proteron argousê, prattei d' êdê ti kai\r\n  pragmateuetai chrêston hê apokritikê te kai proôstikê;\r\n  kai gar oun kai tautên houtôs ekalesan apo tôn energeiôn\r\n  autê ta onomata themenoi kathaper kai tais allais.\r\n\r\n  Kai pôs ho logos eoiken hyper amphoterôn apodeixein\r\n  hama; kai gar toi kai diadechomenas autas allêlas kai\r\n  parachôrousan aei tên heteran tê loipê, kathoti an hê\r\n  chreia keleuê, kai tên didaskalian koinên ouk apeikos\r\n  esti dechesthai. tês men oun kathektikês dynameôs ergon\r\n  peristeilai tas mêtras tô kyoumenô pantachothen, hôst'\r\n  eulogôs haptomenais men tais maieutriais to stoma\r\n  memykos autôn phainetai, tais kyousais d' autais kata\r\n  tas prôtas hêmeras kai malista kat' autên ekeinên, en\r\n  hêper an hê tês gonês syllêpsis genêtai, kinoumenôn te\r\n  kai syntrechousôn eis heautas tôn hysterôn aisthê||sis        150\r\n  gignetai kai ên amphô tauta symbê, mysai men to stoma\r\n  chôris phlegmonês ê tinos allou pathêmatos, aisthêsin de\r\n  tês kata tas mêtras kinêseôs akolouthêsai, pros hautas\r\n  êdê to sperma to para tandros eilêphenai te kai\r\n  katechein hai gynaikes nomizousi.\r\n\r\n  Tauta d' ouch hêmeis nyn anaplattomen hêmin autois, all'\r\n  ek makras peiras dokimasthenta pasi gegraptai schedon ti\r\n  tois peri toutôn pragmateusamenois.

For if it be in a natural condition, employing\r\nits contractile faculty in the ordinary way, then, even if its\r\ncontents be very small, it grasps the whole of them and does not leave\r\nany empty space. When it is weak, however, being unable to lay hold of\r\nits contents accurately, it produces a certain amount of vacant space,\r\nand allows the liquid contents to flow about in different directions\r\nin accordance with its changes of shape, and so to produce gurglings.\r\n\r\nThus those who are troubled with this symptom expect, with good\r\nreason, that they will also be unable to digest adequately; proper\r\ndigestion cannot take place in a weak stomach. In such people also,\r\nthe mass of food may be plainly seen to remain an abnormally long time\r\nin the stomach, as would be natural if their digestion were slow.\r\nIndeed, the chief way in which these people will surprise one is in\r\nthe length of time that not food alone but even fluids will remain in\r\ntheir stomachs. Now, the actual cause of this is not, as one would\r\nimagine, that the lower outlet of the stomach,[311] being fairly\r\nnarrow, will allow nothing to pass before being reduced to a fine\r\nstate of division. There are a great many people who frequently\r\nswallow large quantities of big fruit-stones; one person, who was\r\nholding a gold ring in his mouth, inadvertently swallowed it; another\r\nswallowed a coin, and various people have swallowed various hard and\r\nindigestible objects; yet all these people easily passed by the bowel\r\nwhat they had swallowed, without there being any subsequent symptoms.\r\nNow surely if narrowness of the gastric outlet were the cause of\r\nuntriturated food remaining for an abnormally long time, none of these\r\narticles I have mentioned would ever have escaped. Furthermore, the\r\nfact that it is liquids which remain longest in these people's\r\nstomachs is sufficient to put the idea of narrowness of the outlet out\r\nof court. For, supposing a rapid descent were dependent upon\r\nemulsification,[312] then soups, milk, and barley-emulsion[313] would\r\nat once pass along in every case. But as a matter of fact this is not\r\nso. For in people who are extremely asthenic it is just these fluids\r\nwhich remain undigested, which accumulate and produce gurglings, and\r\nwhich oppress and overload the stomach, whereas in strong persons not\r\nmerely do none of these things happen, but even a large quantity of\r\nbread or meat passes rapidly down.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not only because the stomach is distended and loaded and\r\nbecause the fluid runs from one part of it to another accompanied by\r\ngurglings--it is not only for these reasons that one would judge that\r\nthere was an unduly long continuance of the food in it, in those\r\npeople who are so disposed, but also from the _vomiting_. Thus, there\r\nare some who vomit up every particle of what they have eaten, not\r\nafter three or four hours, but actually in the middle of the night, a\r\nlengthy period having elapsed since their meal.\r\n\r\nSuppose you fill any animal whatsoever with liquid food--an experiment\r\nI have often carried out in pigs, to whom I give a sort of mess of\r\nwheaten flour and water, thereafter cutting them open after three or\r\nfour hours; if you will do this yourself, you will find the food still\r\nin the stomach. For it is not _chylification_[314] which determines\r\nthe length of its stay here--since this can also be effected outside\r\nthe stomach; the determining factor is _digestion_[315] which is a\r\ndifferent thing from chylification, as are blood-production and\r\nnutrition. For, just as it has been shown[316] that these two\r\nprocesses depend upon a _change of qualities_, similarly also the\r\ndigestion of food in the stomach involves a transmutation of it into\r\nthe quality proper to that which is receiving nourishment.[317] Then,\r\nwhen it is completely digested, the lower outlet opens and the food is\r\nquickly ejected through it, even if there should be amongst it\r\nabundance of stones, bones, grape-pips, or other things which cannot\r\nbe reduced to chyle. And you may observe this yourself in an animal,\r\nif you will try to hit upon the time at which the descent of food from\r\nthe stomach takes place. But even if you should fail to discover the\r\ntime, and nothing was yet passing down, and the food was still\r\nundergoing digestion in the stomach, still even then you would find\r\ndissection not without its uses. You will observe, as we have just\r\nsaid, that the pylorus is accurately closed, and that the whole\r\nstomach is in a state of contraction upon the food very much as the\r\nwomb contacts upon the foetus. For it is never possible to find a\r\nvacant space in the uterus, the stomach, or in either of the two\r\nbladders--that is, either in that called bile-receiving[318] or in the\r\nother; whether their contents be abundant or scanty, their cavities\r\nare seen to be replete and full, owing to the fact that their coats\r\ncontract constantly upon the contents--so long, at least, as the\r\nanimal is in a natural condition.\r\n\r\nNow Erasistratus for some reason declares that it is the\r\ncontractions[319] of the stomach which are the cause of\r\neverything--that is to say, of the softening of the food,[320] the\r\nremoval of waste matter, and the absorption of the food when chylified\r\n[emulsified].\r\n\r\nNow I have personally, on countless occasions, divided the peritoneum\r\nof a still living animal and have always found all _the intestines_\r\ncontracting peristaltically[321] upon their contents. The condition of\r\n_the stomach_, however, is found less simple; as regards the\r\nsubstances freshly swallowed, it had grasped these accurately both\r\nabove and below, in fact at every point, and was as devoid of movement\r\nas though it had grown round and become united with the food.[322] At\r\nthe same time I found the pylorus persistently closed and accurately\r\nshut, like the os uteri on the foetus.\r\n\r\nIn the cases, however, where digestion had been completed the pylorus\r\nhad opened, and the stomach was undergoing peristaltic movements,\r\nsimilar to those of the intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IV\r\n\r\n  Houtô men epi tôn mêtrôn enargôs hai dyo phainontai\r\n  dynameis, epi de tês gastros hôde. prôton men tois\r\n  klydôsin, hoi dê kai pepisteuntai tois iatrois arrhôstou\r\n  koilias einai symptômata kai kata logon pepisteuntai;\r\n  eniote men gar elachista prosenênegmenôn ou gignontai\r\n  peristellomenês akribôs autois tês gastros kai\r\n  sphingousês pantachothen, eniote de mestê men hê gastêr\r\n  estin, hoi kly||dônes d' hôs epi kenês exakouontai. kata      153\r\n  physin men gar echousa kai chrômenê kalôs tê\r\n  peristaltikê dynamei, kan oligon ê to periechomenon,\r\n  hapan auto perilambanousa chôran oudemian apoleipei\r\n  kenên, arrhôstousa de, kathoti an adynatêsê perilabein\r\n  akribôs, entauth' eurychôrian tin' ergazomenê synchôrei\r\n  tois periechomenois hygrois kata tas tôn schêmatôn\r\n  metallagas allot' allachose metarrheousi klydônas\r\n  apotelein.\r\n\r\n  Eulogôs oun, hoti mêde pepsousin hikanôs, hoi en tôde tô\r\n  symptômati genomenoi prosdokôsin;

For it has\r\nbeen already shown[323] that the bladder by the liver draws bile into\r\nitself, while it is also quite obvious that it eliminates this daily\r\ninto the stomach. Now, of course, if the eliminative were to succeed\r\nthe attractive faculty and there were not a _retentive_ faculty\r\nbetween the two, there would be found, on every occasion that animals\r\nwere dissected, an equal quantity of bile in the gall-bladder. This\r\nhowever, we do not find. For the bladder is sometimes observed to be\r\nvery full, sometimes quite empty, while at other times you find in it\r\nvarious intermediate degrees of fulness, just as is the case with the\r\nother bladder--that which receives the urine; for even without\r\nresorting to anatomy we may observe that the urinary bladder continues\r\nto collect urine up to the time that it becomes uncomfortable through\r\nthe increasing quantity of urine or the irritation caused by its\r\nacidity--the presumption thus being that here, too, there is a\r\nretentive faculty.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, too, the stomach, when, as often happens, it is irritated\r\nby acidity, gets rid of the food, although still undigested, earlier\r\nthan proper; or again, when oppressed by the quantity of its contents,\r\nor disordered from the co-existence of both conditions, it is seized\r\nwith _diarrhoea_. _Vomiting_ also is an affection of the upper [part\r\nof the] stomach analogous to diarrhoea, and it occurs when the stomach\r\nis overloaded or is unable to stand the quality of the food or surplus\r\nsubstances which it contains. Thus, when such a condition develops in\r\nthe lower parts of the stomach, while the parts about the inlet are\r\nnormal, it ends in diarrhoea, whereas if this condition is in the\r\nupper stomach, the lower parts being normal, it ends in vomiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        V\r\n\r\n  Hapant' oun allêlois homologei tauta kai tê gastri kai\r\n  tais hysterais kai tais kystesin einai tinas emphytous\r\n  dynameis kathektikas men tôn oikeiôn poiotêtôn, ||            158\r\n  apokritikas de tôn allotriôn. hoti men gar helkei tên\r\n  cholên eis heautên hê epi tô hêpati kystis, emprosthen\r\n  dedeiktai, hoti de kai apokrinei kath' hekastên hêmeran\r\n  eis tên gastera, kai tout' enargôs phainetai. kai mên ei\r\n  diedecheto tên helktikên dynamin hê ekkritikê kai mê\r\n  mesê tis amphoin ên hê kathektikê, dia pantos echrên\r\n  anatemnomenôn tôn zôôn ison plêthos cholês heuriskesthai\r\n  kata tên kystin; ou mên heurisketai ge. pote men gar\r\n  plêrestatê, pote de kenotatê, pote de tas en tô metaxy\r\n  diaphoras echousa theôreitai, kathaper kai hê hetera\r\n  kystis hê to ouron hypodechomenê. tautês men ge kai pro\r\n  tês anatomês aisthanometha, prin aniathênai tô plêthei\r\n  baryntheisan ê tê drimytêti dêchtheisan, athroizousês\r\n  eti to ouron, hôs ousês tinos kantautha dynameôs\r\n  kathektikês.\r\n\r\n  Houtô de kai hê gastêr hypo drimytêtos pollakis\r\n  dêchtheisa prôiaiteron tou deontos apepton eti tên\r\n  trophên apotribetai. authis d' an pote tô plêthei\r\n  baryntheisa ê kai kat' amphô synelthonta kakôs\r\n  diatetheisa diarrhoiais healô. kai men ge kai hoi\r\n  emetoi, tô plêthei baryntheisês || autês ê tên poiotêta       159\r\n  tôn en autê sitiôn te kai perittômatôn mê pherousês,\r\n  analogon ti tais diarrhoiais pathêma tês anô gastros\r\n  estin. hotan men gar en tois katô meresin autês hê\r\n  toiautê genêtai diathesis, errhômenôn tôn kata ton\r\n  stomachon, eis diarrhoias eteleutêsen, hotan d' en tois\r\n  kata to stoma, tôn allôn eurôstountôn, eis emetous.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              VI\r\n\r\nThis may often be clearly observed in those who are disinclined for\r\nfood; when obliged to eat, they have not the strength to swallow, and,\r\neven if they force themselves to do so, they cannot retain the food,\r\nbut at once vomit it up. And those especially who have a dislike to\r\nsome particular kind of food, sometimes take it under compulsion, and\r\nthen promptly bring it up; or, if they force themselves to keep it\r\ndown, they are nauseated and feel their stomach turned up, and\r\nendeavouring to relieve itself of its discomfort.\r\n\r\nThus, as was said at the beginning, all the observed facts testify\r\nthat there must exist in almost all parts of the animal a certain\r\ninclination towards, or, so to speak; an appetite for their own\r\nspecial quality, and an aversion to, or, as it were, a hatred[324] of\r\nthe foreign quality. And it is natural that when they feel an\r\ninclination they should attract, and that when they feel aversion they\r\nshould expel.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, then, again, both the attractive and the propulsive\r\nfaculties have been demonstrated to exist in everything.[325]\r\n\r\nBut if there be an inclination or attraction, there will also be some\r\nbenefit derived; for no existing thing attracts anything else for the\r\nmere sake of attracting, but in order to benefit by what is acquired\r\nby the attraction. And of course it cannot benefit by it if it cannot\r\nretain it. Herein, then, again, the retentive faculty is shown to have\r\nits necessary origin: for the stomach obviously inclines towards its\r\nown proper qualities and turns away from those that are foreign to\r\nit.[326]\r\n\r\nBut if it aims at and attracts its food and benefits by it while\r\nretaining and contracting upon it, we may also expect that there will\r\nbe some _termination_ to the benefit received, and that thereafter\r\nwill come the time for the exercise of the eliminative faculty.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       VI\r\n\r\n  Enesti de kai touto pollakis enargôs idein epi tôn\r\n  apositôn; anankazomenoi gar esthiein oute katapinein\r\n  eusthenousin out', ei kai biasainto, katechousin, all'\r\n  euthys anemousi. kai hoi allôs de tôn edesmatôn pros\r\n  hotioun dyscherainontes biasthentes eniote prosarasthai\r\n  tacheôs exemousin, ê ei kataschoien biasamenoi,\r\n  nautiôdeis t' eisi kai tês gastros hyptias aisthanontai\r\n  kai speudousês apothesthai to lypoun.\r\n\r\n  Houtôs ex hapantôn tôn phainomenôn, hoper ex archês\r\n  errhethê, martyreitai to dein hyparchein tois tou zôou\r\n  moriois schedon hapasin ephesin men tina kai hoion\r\n  orexin tês oikeias poiotêtos, apostrophên de tina || kai      160\r\n  hoion misos ti tês allotrias, all' ephiemena men helkein\r\n  eulogon, apostrephomena d' ekkrinein.\r\n\r\n  Kak toutôn palin hê th' helktikê dynamis apodeiknytai\r\n  kath' hapan hyparchousa kai hê proôstikê.\r\n\r\n  All' eiper ephesis te tis esti kai helxis, eiê an tis\r\n  kai apolausis; ouden gar tôn ontôn helkei ti di' auto to\r\n  helkein, all' hin' apolausê tou dia tês holkês\r\n  euporêthentos. kai mên apolauein ou dynatai mê\r\n  kataschon. kan toutô palin hê kathektikê dynamis\r\n  apodeiknytai tên genesin anankaian echousa; saphôs gar\r\n  ephietai men tôn oikeiôn poiotêtôn hê gastêr,\r\n  apostrephetai de tas allotrias.\r\n\r\n  All' eiper ephietai te kai helkei kai apolauei\r\n  katechousa kai peristellomenê, eiê an ti kai peras autê\r\n  tês apolauseôs kapi tôd' ho kairos êdê tês ekkritikês\r\n  dynameôs energousês.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VII\r\n\r\nBut if the stomach both retains and benefits by its food, then it\r\nemploys it for the end for which it [the stomach] naturally exists.\r\nAnd it exists to partake of that which is of a quality befitting and\r\nproper to it. Thus it attracts all the most useful parts of the food\r\nin a vaporous[327] and finely divided condition, storing this up in\r\nits own coats, and applying[328] it to them. And when it is\r\nsufficiently full it puts away from it, as one might something\r\ntroublesome, the rest of the food, this having itself meanwhile\r\nobtained some profit from its association with the stomach. For it is\r\nimpossible for two bodies which are adapted for acting and being acted\r\nupon to come together without either both acting or being acted upon,\r\nor else one acting and the other being acted upon. For if their forces\r\nare equal they will act and be acted upon equally, and if the one be\r\nmuch superior in strength, it will exert its activity upon its passive\r\nneighbour; thus, while producing a great and appreciable effect, it\r\nwill itself be acted upon either little or not at all. But it is\r\nherein also that the main difference lies between nourishing food and\r\na deleterious drug; the latter masters the forces of the body, whereas\r\nthe former is mastered by them.[329]\r\n\r\nThere cannot, then, be food which is suited for the animal which is\r\nnot also correspondingly subdued by the qualities existing in the\r\nanimal. And to be subdued means to undergo _alteration_.[330] Now,\r\nsome parts are stronger in power and others weaker; therefore, while\r\nall will subdue the nutriment which is proper to the animal, they will\r\nnot all do so equally. Thus the stomach will subdue and alter its\r\nfood, but not to the same extent as will the liver, veins, arteries,\r\nand heart.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore observe to what extent it does alter it. The\r\nalteration is more than that which occurs in the mouth, but less than\r\nthat in the liver and veins. For the latter alteration changes the\r\nnutriment into the _substance_ of blood, whereas that in the mouth\r\nobviously changes it into a new _form_, but certainly does not\r\ncompletely transmute it. This you may discover in the food which is\r\nleft in the intervals between the teeth, and which remains there all\r\nnight; the bread is not exactly bread, nor the meat, for they\r\nhave a smell similar to that of the animal's mouth, and have been\r\ndisintegrated and dissolved, and have had the qualities of the\r\nanimal's flesh impressed upon them. And you may observe the extent of\r\nthe alteration which occurs to food in the mouth if you will chew some\r\ncorn and then apply it to an unripe [undigested] boil: you will see it\r\nrapidly transmuting--in fact entirely digesting--the boil, though it\r\ncannot do anything of the kind if you mix it with water. And do not\r\nlet this surprise you; this phlegm [saliva] in the mouth is also a\r\ncure for _lichens_[331]; it even rapidly destroys scorpions; while, as\r\nregards the animals which emit venom, some it kills at once, and\r\nothers after an interval; to all of them in any case it does great\r\ndamage. Now, the masticated food is all, firstly, soaked in and mixed\r\nup with this phlegm; and secondly, it is brought into contact with the\r\nactual skin of the mouth; thus it undergoes more change than the food\r\nwhich is wedged into the vacant spaces between the teeth.\r\n\r\nBut just as masticated food is more altered than the latter kind, so\r\nis food which has been swallowed more altered than that which has been\r\nmerely masticated. Indeed, there is no comparison between these two\r\nprocesses; we have only to consider what the stomach contains--phlegm,\r\nbile, pneuma, [innate] heat,[332] and, indeed the whole substance of\r\nthe stomach. And if one considers along with this the adjacent\r\nviscera, like a lot of burning hearths around a great cauldron--to the\r\nright the liver, to the left the spleen, the heart above, and along\r\nwith it the diaphragm (suspended and in a state of constant movement),\r\nand the omentum sheltering them all--you may believe what an\r\nextraordinary alteration it is which occurs in the food taken into the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nHow could it easily become blood if it were not previously prepared by\r\nmeans of a change of this kind? It has already been shown[333] that\r\nnothing is altered all at once from one quality to its opposite. How\r\nthen could bread, beef, beans, or any other food turn into blood if\r\nthey had not previously undergone some other alteration? And how could\r\nthe faeces be generated right away in the small intestine?[334] For\r\nwhat is there in this organ more potent in producing alteration than\r\nthe factors in the stomach? Is it the number of the coats, or the way\r\nit is surrounded by neighbouring viscera, or the time that the food\r\nremains in it, or some kind of innate heat which it contains? Most\r\nassuredly the intestines have the advantage of the stomach in none of\r\nthese respects. For what possible reason, then, will objectors have it\r\nthat bread may often remain a whole night in the stomach and still\r\npreserve its original qualities, whereas when once it is projected\r\ninto the intestines, it straightway becomes ordure? For, if such a\r\nlong period of time is incapable of altering it, neither will the\r\nshort period be sufficient, or, if the latter is enough, surely the\r\nlonger time will be much more so! Well, then, can it be that, while\r\nthe nutriment does undergo an alteration in the stomach, this is a\r\ndifferent kind of alteration and one which is not dependent on the\r\nnature of the organ which alters it? Or if it be an alteration of this\r\nlatter kind, yet one perhaps which is not proper to the body of the\r\nanimal? This is still more impossible. Digestion was shown to be\r\nnothing else than an alteration to the quality proper to that which is\r\nreceiving nourishment.[335] Since, then, this is what digestion means\r\nand since the nutriment has been shown to take on in the stomach a\r\nquality appropriate to the animal which is about to be nourished by\r\nit, it has been demonstrated adequately that nutriment does undergo\r\ndigestion in the stomach.\r\n\r\nAnd Asclepiades is absurd when he states that the quality of the\r\ndigested food never shows itself either in eructations or in the\r\nvomited matter, or on dissection.[336] For of course the mere fact\r\nthat the food smells of the body shows that it has undergone gastric\r\ndigestion. But this man is so foolish that, when he hears the Ancients\r\nsaying that the food is converted in the stomach into something\r\n\"good,\" he thinks it proper to look out not for what is good in its\r\npossible effects, but for what is _good to the taste_: this is like\r\nsaying that apples (for so one has to argue with him) become more\r\napple-like [in flavour] in the stomach, or honey more honey-like!\r\n\r\nErasistratus, however, is still more foolish and absurd, either\r\nthrough not perceiving in what sense the Ancients said that digestion\r\nis similar to the process of _boiling_, or because he purposely\r\nconfused himself with sophistries. It is, he says, inconceivable that\r\ndigestion, involving as it does such trifling warmth, should be\r\nrelated to the boiling process. This is as if we were to suppose that\r\nit was necessary to put the fires of Etna under the stomach before it\r\ncould manage to alter the food; or else that, while it was capable of\r\naltering the food, it did not do this by virtue of its innate heat,\r\nwhich of course was moist, so that the word _boil_ was used instead of\r\n_bake_.\r\n\r\nWhat he ought to have done, if it was facts that he wished to dispute\r\nabout, was to have tried to show, first and foremost, that the food is\r\nnot transmuted or altered in quality by the stomach at all, and\r\nsecondly, if he could not be confident of this, he ought to have tried\r\nto show that this alteration was not of any advantage to the\r\nanimal.[337] If, again, he were unable even to make this\r\nmisrepresentation, he ought to have attempted to confute the postulate\r\nconcerning _the active principles_--to show, in fact, that the\r\nfunctions taking place in the various parts do not depend on the way\r\nin which the Warm, Cold, Dry, and Moist are mixed, but on some other\r\nfactor. And if he had not the audacity to misrepresent facts even so\r\nfar as this, still he should have tried at least to show that the Warm\r\nis not the most active of all the principles which play a part in\r\nthings governed by Nature. But if he was unable to demonstrate this\r\nany more than any of the previous propositions, then he ought not to\r\nhave made himself ridiculous by quarrelling uselessly with a mere\r\nname--as though Aristotle had not clearly stated in the fourth book of\r\nhis \"Meteorology,\" as well as in many other passages, in what way\r\ndigestion can be said to be allied to boiling, and also that the\r\nlatter expression is not used in its primitive or strict sense.\r\n\r\nBut, as has been frequently said already,[338] the one starting-point\r\nof all this is a thoroughgoing enquiry into the question of the Warm,\r\nCold, Dry and Moist; this Aristotle carried out in the second of his\r\nbooks \"On Genesis and Destruction,\" where he shows that all the\r\ntransmutations and alterations throughout the body take place as a\r\nresult of these principles. Erasistratus, however, advanced nothing\r\nagainst these or anything else that has been said above, but occupied\r\nhimself merely with the word \"boiling.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                      VII\r\n\r\n  All' ei kai katechei kai apolauei, katachrêtai pros ho\r\n  pephyke. pephyke de tou prosêkontos heautê || kata            161\r\n  poiotêta kai oikeiou metalambanein; hôsth' helkei tôn\r\n  sitiôn hoson chrêstotaton atmôdôs te kai kata brachy kai\r\n  touto tois heautês chitôsin enapotithetai te kai\r\n  prostithêsin. hotan d' hikanôs emplêsthê, kathaper\r\n  achthos ti tên loipên apotithetai trophên eschêkuian ti\r\n  chrêston êdê kai autên ek tês pros tên gastera\r\n  koinônias; oude gar endechetai dyo sômata dran kai\r\n  paschein epitêdeia synelthonta mê ouk êtoi paschein th'\r\n  hama kai dran ê thateron men dran, thateron de paschein.\r\n  ean men gar isazê tais dynamesin, ex isou drasei te kai\r\n  peisetai, an d' hyperechê poly kai kratê thateron,\r\n  energêsei peri to paschon; hôste drasei mega men ti kai\r\n  aisthêton, auto d' êtoi smikron ti kai ouk aisthêton ê\r\n  pantapasin ouden peisetai. all' en toutô dê kai malista\r\n  diênenke pharmakou dêlêtêriou trophê; to men gar kratei\r\n  tês en tô sômati dynameôs, hê de krateitai.\r\n\r\n  Oukoun endechetai trophên men einai ti tô zôô\r\n  prosêkousan, ou mên kai krateisthai g' homoiôs pros tôn\r\n  || en tô zôô poiotêtôn; to krateisthai d' ên                  162\r\n  alloiousthai. all' epei ta men ischyrotera tais\r\n  dynamesin esti moria, ta d' asthenestera, kratêsei men\r\n  panta tês oikeias tô zôô trophês, ouch homoiôs de panta;\r\n  kratêsei d' ara kai hê gastêr kai alloiôsei men tên\r\n  trophên, ou mên homoiôs hêpati kai phlepsi kai artêriais\r\n  kai kardia.\r\n\r\n  Poson oun estin, ho alloioi, kai dê theasômetha; pleon\r\n  men ê kata to stoma, meion d' ê kata to hêpar te kai tas\r\n  phlebas. hautê men gar hê alloiôsis eis haimatos ousian\r\n  agei tên trophên, hê d' en tô stomati methistêsi men\r\n  autên enargôs eis heteron eidos, ou mên eis telos ge\r\n  metakosmei. mathois d' an epi tôn enkataleiphthentôn\r\n  tais diastasesi tôn odontôn sitiôn kai katameinantôn di'\r\n  holês nyktos; oute gar artos akribôs ho artos oute kreas\r\n  esti to kreas, all' ozei men toiouton, hoionper kai tou\r\n  zôou to stoma, dialelytai de kai diatetêke kai tas en tô\r\n  zôô tês sarkos apomemaktai poiotêtas. enesti de soi\r\n  theasasthai to megethos tês en tô stomati || tôn sitiôn       163\r\n  alloiôseôs, ei pyrous masêsamenos epitheiês apeptois\r\n  dothiêsin; opsei gar autous tachista metaballontas te\r\n  kai sympettontas, ouden toiouton, hotan hydati\r\n  phyrathôsin, ergasasthai dynamenous. kai mê thaumasês;\r\n  to gar toi phlegma touti to kata to stoma kai leichênôn\r\n  estin akos kai skorpious anairei parachrêma kai polla\r\n  tôn iobolôn thêriôn ta men eutheôs apokteinei, ta d' es\r\n  hysteron; hapanta goun blaptei megalôs. alla ta\r\n  memasêmena sitia prôton men toutô tô phlegmati bebrektai\r\n  te kai pephyratai, deuteron de kai tô chrôti tou\r\n  stomatos hapanta peplêsiaken, hôste pleiona metabolên\r\n  eilêphe tôn en tais kenais chôrais tôn odontôn\r\n  esphênômenôn.\r\n\r\n  All' hoson ta memasêmena toutôn epi pleon êlloiôtai,\r\n  tosouton ekeinôn ta katapothenta. mê gar oude parablêton\r\n  ê to tês hyperbolês, ei to kata tên koilian ennoêsaimen\r\n  phlegma kai cholên kai pneuma kai thermasian kai holên\r\n  tên ousian tês gastros. ei de kai synepinoêsais autê ta\r\n  parakeimena || splanchna kathaper tini lebêti megalô          164\r\n  pyros hestias pollas, ek dexiôn men to hêpar, ex\r\n  aristerôn de ton splêna, tên kardian d' ek tôn anô, syn\r\n  autê de kai tas phrenas aiôroumenas te kai dia pantos\r\n  kinoumenas, eph' hapasi de toutois skepon to epiploon,\r\n  exaision tina peisthêsê tên alloiôsin gignesthai tôn eis\r\n  tên gastera katapothentôn sitiôn.\r\n\r\n  Pôs d' an êdynato rhadiôs haimatousthai mê\r\n  proparaskeuasthenta tê toiautê metabolê?

What are his words?\r\n\r\n\"The stomach does not appear to exercise any traction.\"[339]\r\n\r\nNow the fact is that the stomach possesses two coats, which certainly\r\nexist for some purpose; they extend as far as the mouth, the internal\r\none remaining throughout similar to what it is in the stomach, and the\r\nother one tending to become of a more fleshy nature in the gullet. Now\r\nsimple observation will testify that these coats have their fibres\r\ninserted in contrary directions.[340] And, although Erasistratus did\r\nnot attempt to say for what reason they are like this, I am going to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nThe inner coat has its fibres straight, since it exists for the\r\npurpose of traction. The outer coat has its fibres transverse, for the\r\npurpose of peristalsis.[341] In fact, the movements of each of the\r\n_mobile_ organs of the body depend on the setting of the fibres. Now\r\nplease test this assertion first in the muscles themselves; in these\r\nthe fibres are most distinct, and their movements visible owing to\r\ntheir vigour. And after the muscles, pass to the _physical_\r\norgans,[342] and you will see that they all move in correspondence\r\nwith their fibres. This is why the fibres throughout the intestines\r\nare circular in both coats--they only contract peristaltically, they\r\ndo not exercise traction. The stomach, again, has some of its fibres\r\nlongitudinal for the purpose of traction and the others transverse for\r\nthe purpose of peristalsis.[342] For just as the movements in the\r\nmuscles[343] take place when each of the fibres becomes tightened and\r\ndrawn towards its origin, such also is what happens in the stomach;\r\nwhen the transverse fibres tighten, the breadth of the cavity\r\ncontained by them becomes less; and when the longitudinal fibres\r\ncontract and draw in upon themselves, the length must necessarily be\r\ncurtailed. This curtailment of length, indeed, is well seen in the act\r\nof swallowing: the larynx is seen to rise upwards to exactly the same\r\ndegree that the gullet is drawn downwards; while, after the process of\r\nswallowing has been completed and the gullet is released from tension,\r\nthe larynx can be clearly seen to sink down again. This is because the\r\ninner coat of the stomach, which has the longitudinal fibres and which\r\nalso lines the gullet and the mouth, extends to the interior of the\r\nlarynx, and it is thus impossible for it to be drawn down by the\r\nstomach without the larynx being involved in the traction.\r\n\r\nFurther, it will be found acknowledged in Erasistratus's own writings\r\nthat the circular fibres (by which the stomach as well as other parts\r\nperforms its contractions) do not curtail its length, but contract and\r\nlessen its breadth. For he says that the stomach contracts\r\nperistaltically round the food during the whole period of digestion.\r\nBut if it contracts, without in any way being diminished in length,\r\nthis is because downward traction of the gullet is not a property of\r\nthe movement of circular peristalsis. For what alone happens, as\r\nErasistratus himself said, is that when the upper parts contract the\r\nlower ones dilate.[344] And everyone knows that this can be plainly\r\nseen happening even in a dead man, if water be poured down his throat;\r\nthis symptom[345] results from the passage of matter through a narrow\r\nchannel; it would be extraordinary it the channel did not dilate when\r\na mass was passing through it.[346] Obviously then the dilatation of\r\nthe lower parts along with the contraction of the upper is common both\r\nto dead bodies, when anything whatsoever is passing through them, and\r\nto living ones, whether they contract peristaltically round their\r\ncontents or attract them.[347]\r\n\r\nCurtailment of length, on the other hand, is peculiar to organs which\r\npossess longitudinal fibres for the purpose of attraction. But the\r\ngullet was shown to be pulled down; for otherwise it would not have\r\ndrawn upon the larynx. It is therefore clear that the stomach attracts\r\nfood by the gullet.\r\n\r\nFurther, in _vomiting_, the mere passive conveyance of rejected matter\r\nup to the mouth will certainly itself suffice to keep open those parts\r\nof the oesophagus which are distended by the returned food; as it\r\noccupies each part in front [above], it first dilates this, and of\r\ncourse leaves the part behind [below] contracted. Thus, in this\r\nrespect at least, the condition of the gullet is precisely similar to\r\nwhat it is in the act of swallowing.[348] But there being no\r\n_traction_, the whole length remains equal in such cases.\r\n\r\nAnd for this reason it is easier to swallow than to vomit, for\r\ndeglutition results from _both_ coats of the stomach being brought\r\ninto action, the inner one exerting a pull and the outer one helping\r\nby peristalsis and propulsion, whereas emesis occurs from the outer\r\ncoat alone functioning, without there being any kind of pull towards\r\nthe mouth. For, although the swallowing of food is ordinarily preceded\r\nby a feeling of desire on the part of the stomach, there is in the\r\ncase of vomiting no corresponding desire from the mouth-parts for the\r\nexperience; the two are opposite dispositions of the stomach itself;\r\nit yearns after and tends towards what is advantageous and proper to\r\nit, it loathes and rids itself of what is foreign. Thus the actual\r\nprocess of swallowing occurs very quickly in those who have a good\r\nappetite for such foods as are proper to the stomach; this organ\r\nobviously draws them in and down before they are masticated; whereas\r\nin the case of those who are forced to take a medicinal draught or who\r\ntake food as medicine, the swallowing of these articles is\r\naccomplished with distress and difficulty.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, then, it is clear that the inner coat of the\r\nstomach (that containing longitudinal fibres) exists for the purpose\r\nof exerting a pull from mouth to stomach, and that it is only in\r\ndeglutition that it is active, whereas the external coat, which\r\ncontains transverse fibres, has been so constituted in order that it\r\nmay contract upon its contents and propel them forward; this coat\r\nfurthermore, functions in vomiting no less than in swallowing. The\r\ntruth of my statement is also borne out by what happens in the case of\r\nthe _channae_ and _synodonts_[349]; the stomachs of these animals are\r\nsometimes found in their mouths, as also Aristotle writes in his\r\n_History of Animals_; he also adds the cause of this: he says that it\r\nis owing to their voracity.\r\n\r\nThe facts are as follows. In all animals, when the appetite is very\r\nintense, the stomach rises up, so that some people who have a clear\r\nperception of this condition say that their stomach \"creeps out\" of\r\nthem; in others, who are still masticating their food and have not yet\r\nworked it up properly in the mouth, the stomach obviously snatches\r\naway the food from them against their will. In those animals,\r\ntherefore, which are naturally voracious, in whom the mouth cavity is\r\nof generous proportions, and the stomach situated close to it (as in\r\nthe case of the synodont and channa), it is in no way surprising that,\r\nwhen they are sufficiently hungry and are pursuing one of the smaller\r\nanimals, and are just on the point of catching it, the stomach should,\r\nunder the impulse of desire, spring into the mouth. And this cannot\r\npossibly take place in any other way than by the stomach drawing the\r\nfood to itself by means of the gullet, as though by a hand. In fact,\r\njust as we ourselves, in our eagerness to grasp more quickly something\r\nlying before us, sometimes stretch out our whole bodies along with our\r\nhands, so also the stomach stretches itself forward along with the\r\ngullet, which is, as it were, its hand. And thus, in these animals in\r\nwhom those three factors co-exist--an excessive propensity for food, a\r\nsmall gullet, and ample mouth proportions--in these, any slight\r\ntendency to movement forwards brings the whole stomach into the mouth.\r\n\r\nNow the constitution of the organs might itself suffice to give a\r\nnaturalist an indication of their functions. For Nature would never\r\nhave purposelessly constructed the oesophagus of two coats with\r\ncontrary dispositions; they must also have each been meant to have a\r\ndifferent action. The Erasistratean school, however, are capable of\r\nanything rather than of recognizing the effects of Nature. Come,\r\ntherefore, let us demonstrate to them by animal dissection as well\r\nthat each of the two coats does exercise the activity which I have\r\nstated. Take an animal, then; lay bare the structures surrounding the\r\ngullet, without severing any of the nerves,[350] arteries, or veins\r\nwhich are there situated; next divide with vertical incisions, from\r\nthe lower jaw to the thorax, the outer coat of the oesophagus (that\r\ncontaining transverse fibres); then give the animal food and you will\r\nsee that it still swallows although the peristaltic function has been\r\nabolished. If, again, in another animal, you cut through both\r\ncoats[351] with transverse incisions, you will observe that this\r\nanimal also swallows although the inner coat is no longer functioning.\r\nFrom this it is clear that the animal can also swallow by either of\r\nthe two coats, although not so well as by both. For the following\r\nalso, in addition to other points, may be distinctly observed in the\r\ndissection which I have described--that during deglutition the gullet\r\nbecomes slightly filled with air which is swallowed along with the\r\nfood, and that, when the outer coat is contracting, this air is easily\r\nforced with the food into the stomach, but that, when there only\r\nexists an inner coat, the air impedes the conveyance of food, by\r\ndistending this coat and hindering its action.\r\n\r\nBut Erasistratus said nothing about this, nor did he point out that\r\nthe oblique situation of the gullet clearly confutes the teaching of\r\nthose who hold that it is simply by virtue of the impulse from above\r\nthat food which is swallowed reaches the stomach. The only correct\r\nthing he said was that many of the long-necked animals bend down to\r\nswallow. Hence, clearly, the observed fact does not show how we\r\nswallow but how we do not swallow. For from this observation it is\r\nclear that swallowing is not due merely to the impulse from above; it\r\nis yet, however, not clear whether it results from the food being\r\nattracted by the stomach, or conducted by the gullet. For our part,\r\nhowever, having enumerated all the different considerations--those\r\nbased on the constitution of the organs, as well as those based on the\r\nother symptoms which, as just mentioned, occur both before and after\r\nthe gullet has been exposed--we have thus sufficiently proved that the\r\ninner coat exists for the purpose of attraction and the outer for the\r\npurpose of propulsion.\r\n\r\nNow the original task we set before ourselves was to demonstrate that\r\nthe _retentive_ faculty exists in every one of the organs, just as in\r\nthe previous book we proved the existence of the _attractive_, and,\r\nover and above this, the _alterative_ faculty. Thus, in the natural\r\ncourse of our argument, we have demonstrated these four faculties\r\nexisting in the stomach--the attractive faculty in connection with\r\nswallowing, the retentive with digestion, the expulsive with vomiting\r\nand with the descent of digested food into the small intestine--and\r\ndigestion itself we have shown to be a process of _alteration_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     VIII\r\n\r\n  Epi men oun tês pepseôs, ei kai talla panta parelipe, to\r\n  goun hoti diapherei tês ektos hepsêseôs hê en tois zôois\r\n  pepsis, epeirathê deiknynai, peri de tês kataposeôs oud'\r\n  achri tosoutou. ti gar phêsin?\r\n\r\n  \"Holkê men oun tês koilias oudemia phainetai einai.\"\r\n\r\n  Kai mên dyo chitônas hê gastêr echei pantôs heneka tou\r\n  gegonotas kai diêkousin houtoi mechri tou stomatos, ho\r\n  men endon, hoios esti kata tên gastera, toioutos\r\n  diamenôn, ho d' heteros epi to sarkôdesteron en tô\r\n  stomachô trepomenos. hoti men oun enantias allêlais tas\r\n  epibolas tôn inôn echousin hoi chitônes houtoi, to\r\n  phainomenon auto martyrei. tinos d' heneka toioutoi\r\n  gegonasin, Erasistratos men oud' epecheirêsen eipein,\r\n  hêmeis d' eroumen.\r\n\r\n  Ho men endon eutheias echei tas inas, holkês gar heneka\r\n  ge||gonen;

nor shall we be in any doubt as to the liver, veins,\r\narteries, heart, or any other organ. For these four faculties have\r\nbeen shown to be necessary for every part which is to be nourished;\r\nthis is why we have called these faculties the _handmaids of\r\nnutrition_. For just as human faeces are most pleasing to dogs, so the\r\nresidual matters from the liver are, some of them, proper to the\r\nspleen,[353] others to the gall-bladder, and others to the kidneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IX\r\n\r\n  Oukoun et' aporêsomen oude peri tou splênos, ei helkei\r\n  men to oikeion, apokrinei de to allotrion, alloioun de\r\n  kai katechein, hoson an epispasêtai, pephyken, oude peri\r\n  hêpatos ê phlebos ê artêrias ê kardias ê tôn || allôn         178\r\n  tinos; anankaiai gar edeichthêsan hai tettares hautai\r\n  dynameis hapanti moriô tô mellonti threpsesthai kai dia\r\n  tout' autas hypêretidas einai threpseôs ephamen; hôs gar\r\n  to tôn anthrôpôn apopatêma tois kysin hêdiston, houtô\r\n  kai ta tou hêpatos perittômata to men tô splêni, to de\r\n  tê cholêdochô kystei, to de tois nephrois oikeion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               X\r\n\r\nI should not have cared to say anything further as to the origin of\r\nthese [surplus substances] after Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle,\r\nDiocles, Praxagoras, and Philotimus, nor indeed should I even have\r\nsaid anything about the _faculties_, if any of our predecessors had\r\nworked out this subject thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, the statements which the Ancients made on these points\r\nwere correct, they yet omitted to defend their arguments with logical\r\nproofs; of course they never suspected that there could be sophists so\r\nshameless as to try to contradict obvious facts. More recent\r\nphysicians, again, have been partly conquered by the sophistries of\r\nthese fellows and have given credence to them; whilst others who\r\nattempted to argue with them appear to me to lack to a great extent\r\nthe power of the Ancients. For this reason I have attempted to put\r\ntogether my arguments in the way in which it seems to me the Ancients,\r\nhad any of them been still alive, would have done, in opposition to\r\nthose who would overturn the finest doctrines of our art.\r\n\r\nI am not, however, unaware that I shall achieve either nothing at all\r\nor else very little. For I find that a great many things which have\r\nbeen conclusively demonstrated by the Ancients are unintelligible to\r\nthe bulk of the Moderns owing to their ignorance--nay, that, by reason\r\nof their laziness, they will not even make an attempt to comprehend\r\nthem; and even if any of them have understood them, they have not\r\ngiven them impartial examination.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that he whose purpose is to know anything better than the\r\nmultitude do must far surpass all others both as regards his nature\r\nand his early training. And when he reaches early adolescence he must\r\nbecome possessed with an ardent love for truth, like one inspired;\r\nneither day nor night may he cease to urge and strain himself in order\r\nto learn thoroughly all that has been said by the most illustrious of\r\nthe Ancients. And when he has learnt this, then for a prolonged period\r\nhe must test and prove it, observing what part of it is in agreement,\r\nand what in disagreement with obvious fact; thus he will choose this\r\nand turn away from that. To such an one my hope has been that my\r\ntreatise would prove of the very greatest assistance.... Still, such\r\npeople may be expected to be quite few in number, while, as for the\r\nothers, this book will be as superfluous to them as a tale told to an\r\nass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        X\r\n\r\n  Kai legein eti peri tês toutôn geneseôs ouk an etheloimi\r\n  meth' Hippokratên kai Platôna kai Aristotelên kai\r\n  Dioklea kai Praxagoran kai Philotimon; oude gar oude\r\n  peri tôn dynameôn eipon an, ei tis tôn emprosthen\r\n  akribôs exeirgasato ton hyper autôn logon.\r\n\r\n  Epei d' hoi men palaioi kalôs hyper autôn apophênamenoi\r\n  parelipon agônisasthai tô logô, mêd' hyponoêsantes\r\n  esesthai tinas eis tosouton anaischyntous sophistas, hôs\r\n  antilegein epicheirêsai tois enargesin, hoi neôteroi de\r\n  to men ti nikêthentes hypo tôn sophismatôn epeisthêsan\r\n  autois, to de ti kai antilegein epicheirêsantes apodein\r\n  moi poly tês tôn palaiôn edoxan dynameôs, || dia touth',      179\r\n  hôs an ekeinôn autôn, eiper et' ên tis, agônisasthai moi\r\n  dokei pros tous anatrepontas tês technês ta kallista,\r\n  kai autos houtôs epeirathên syntheinai tous logous.\r\n\r\n  Hoti d' ê ouden ê pantapasin anysô ti smikron, ouk\r\n  agnoô; pampolla gar heuriskô teleôs men apodedeigmena\r\n  tois palaiois, oute de syneta tois pollois tôn nyn di'\r\n  amathian all' oud' epicheiroumena gignôskesthai dia\r\n  rhathymian, out', ei kai gnôstheiê tini, dikaiôs\r\n  exetazomena.\r\n\r\n  Chrê gar ton mellonta gnôsesthai ti tôn pollôn ameinon\r\n  euthys men kai tê physei kai tê prôtê didaskalia poly\r\n  tôn allôn dienenkein; epeidan de genêtai meirakion,\r\n  alêtheias tina schein erôtikên manian, hôsper\r\n  enthousiônta kai mêth' hêmeras mête nyktos dialeipein\r\n  speudonta te kai syntetamenon ekmathein, hosa tois\r\n  endoxotatois eirêtai tôn palaiôn; epeidan d' ekmathê,\r\n  krinein auta kai basanizein chronô pampollô kai skopein,\r\n  posa men homologei tois enargôs phainomenois, posa de\r\n  diapheretai, || kai houtô ta men haireisthai, ta d'           180\r\n  apostrephesthai. tô men dê toioutô pany sphodra\r\n  chrêsimous êlpika tous hêmeterous esesthai logous; eien\r\n  d' an oligoi pantapasin houtoi; tois d' allois houtô\r\n  genêsetai to gramma peritton, hôs ei kai mython onô tis\r\n  legoi.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              XI\r\n\r\nFor the sake, then, of those who are aiming at truth, we must complete\r\nthis treatise by adding what is still wanting in it. Now, in people\r\nwho are very hungry, the stomach obviously attracts or draws down the\r\nfood before it has been thoroughly softened in the mouth, whilst in\r\nthose who have no appetite or who are being forced to eat, the stomach\r\nis displeased and rejects the food.[354] And in a similar way each of\r\nthe other organs possesses both faculties--that of attracting what is\r\nproper to it, and that of rejecting what is foreign. Thus, even if\r\nthere be any organ which consists of only one coat (such as the two\r\nbladders,[355] the uterus, and the veins), it yet possesses both kinds\r\nof fibres, the longitudinal and the transverse.\r\n\r\nBut further, there are fibres of a third kind--the _oblique_--which\r\nare much fewer in number than the two kinds already spoken of. In the\r\norgans consisting of two coats this kind of fibre is found in the one\r\ncoat only, mixed with the longitudinal fibres; but in the organs\r\ncomposed of one coat it is found along with the other two kinds. Now,\r\nthese are of the greatest help to the action of the faculty which we\r\nhave named _retentive_. For during this period the part needs to be\r\ntightly contracted and stretched over its contents at every point--the\r\nstomach during the whole period of digestion,[356] and the uterus\r\nduring that of gestation.\r\n\r\nThus too, the coat of a vein, being single, consists of various kinds\r\nof fibres; whilst the outer coat of an artery consists of circular\r\nfibres, and its inner coat mostly of longitudinal fibres, but with a\r\nfew oblique ones also amongst them. Veins thus resemble the uterus or\r\nthe bladder as regards the arrangement of their fibres, even though\r\nthey are deficient in thickness; similarly arteries resemble the\r\nstomach. Alone of all organs the intestines consist of two coats of\r\nwhich both have their fibres transverse.[357] Now the proof that it\r\nwas _for the best_ that all the organs should be naturally such as\r\nthey are (that, for instance, the intestines should be composed of two\r\ncoats) belongs to the subject of the _use of parts_[358]; thus we must\r\nnot now desire to hear about matters of this kind nor why the\r\nanatomists are at variance regarding the number of coats in each\r\norgan. For these questions have been sufficiently discussed in the\r\ntreatise \"On Disagreement in Anatomy.\" And the problem as to why each\r\norgan has such and such a character will be discussed in the treatise\r\n\"On the Use of Parts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                       XI\r\n\r\n  Symperanteon oun hêmin ton logon heneka tôn tês\r\n  alêtheias ephiemenôn hosa leipei kat' auton eti\r\n  prostheisin. hôs gar hê gastêr helkei men enargôs kai\r\n  kataspa ta sitia tois sphodra peinôdesi, prin akribôs en\r\n  tô stomati leiôthênai, dyscherainei de kai apôtheitai\r\n  tois apositois te kai pros anankên esthiousin, houtô kai\r\n  tôn allôn organôn hekaston amphoteras echei tas\r\n  dynameis, tên te tôn oikeiôn helktikên kai tên tôn\r\n  allotriôn apokritikên. kai dia touto, kan ex henos ê\r\n  chitônos organon ti synestôs, hôsper kai hai kysteis\r\n  amphoterai kai hai mêtrai kai hai phlebes, amphotera tôn\r\n  inôn echei ta genê, tôn eutheiôn te kai tôn enkarsiôn.\r\n\r\n  Kai men ge kai triton ti || genos inôn esti <tôn> loxôn,      181\r\n  elatton poly tô plêthei tôn proeirêmenôn dyo genôn.\r\n  heurisketai d' en men tois ek dyoin chitônôn\r\n  synestêkosin organois en thaterô monô tais eutheiais\r\n  isin anamemigmenon, en de tois ex henos hama tois allois\r\n  dyo genesi. synepilambanousi d' hautai megiston tê tês\r\n  kathektikês onomastheisês dynameôs energeia; deitai gar\r\n  en toutô tô chronô pantachothen esphinchthai kai\r\n  peritetasthai tois enyparchousi to morion, hê men gastêr\r\n  en tô tês pepseôs, hai mêtrai d' en tô tês kyêseôs\r\n  chronô panti.\r\n\r\n  Taut' ara kai ho tês phlebos chitôn heis ôn ek polyeidôn\r\n  inôn egeneto kai tôn tês artêrias ho men exôthen ek tôn\r\n  strongylôn, ho d' esôthen ek men tôn eutheiôn pleistôn,\r\n  oligôn de tinôn syn autais kai tôn loxôn, hôste tas men\r\n  phlebas tais mêtrais kai tais kystesin eoikenai kata ge\r\n  tên tôn inôn synthesin, ei kai tô pachei leipontai, tas\r\n  d' artêrias tê gastri. mona de pantôn organôn ek dyoin\r\n  th' hama kai amphoterôn enkarsias echontôn tas inas\r\n  egeneto ta entera. to d' hoti beltion ên || tôn t' allôn      182\r\n  hekastô toioutô tên physin hyparchein, hoionper kai nyn\r\n  esti, tois t' enterois ek dyoin homoiôn chitônôn\r\n  synkeisthai, tês peri chreias moriôn pragmateias estin.\r\n  oukoun nyn chrê pothein akouein peri tôn toioutôn,\r\n  hôsper oude dia ti peri tou plêthous tôn chitônôn\r\n  hekastou tôn organôn diapephônêtai tois anatomikois\r\n  andrasin. hyper men gar toutôn autarkôs en tois peri tês\r\n  anatomikês diaphônias eirêtai; peri de tou dioti\r\n  toiouton hekaston egeneto tôn organôn, en tois peri\r\n  chreias moriôn eirêsetai.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             XII\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, our business to discuss either of these questions\r\nhere, but to consider duly the _natural faculties_, which, to the\r\nnumber of four, exist in each organ. Returning then, to this point,\r\nlet us recall what has already been said, and set a crown to the whole\r\nsubject by adding what is still wanting. For when every part of the\r\nanimal has been shewn to draw into itself the juice which is proper to\r\nit (this being practically _the first of the natural faculties_), the\r\nnext point to realise is that the part does not get rid either of this\r\nattracted nutriment as a whole, or even of any superfluous portion of\r\nit, until either the organ itself, or the major part of its contents\r\nalso have their condition reversed. Thus, when the stomach is\r\nsufficiently filled with the food and has absorbed and stored away the\r\nmost useful part of it in its own coats, it then rejects the rest like\r\nan alien burden. The same happens to the bladders, when the matter\r\nattracted into them begins to give trouble either because it distends\r\nthem through its quantity or irritates them by its quality.\r\n\r\nAnd this also happens in the case of the uterus; for it is either\r\nbecause it can no longer bear to be stretched that it strives to\r\nrelieve itself of its annoyance, or else because it is irritated by\r\nthe quality of the fluids poured out into it. Now both of these\r\nconditions sometimes occur with actual violence, and then\r\n_miscarriage_ takes place. But for the most part they happen in a\r\nnormal way, this being then called not miscarriage but _delivery_ or\r\n_parturition_. Now abortifacient drugs or certain other conditions\r\nwhich destroy the embryo or rupture certain of its membranes are\r\nfollowed by abortion, and similarly also when the uterus is in pain\r\nfrom being in a bad state of tension; and, as has been well said by\r\nHippocrates, excessive movement on the part of the embryo itself\r\nbrings on labour. Now _pain_ is common to all these conditions, and of\r\nthis there are three possible causes--either excessive bulk, or\r\nweight, or irritation; bulk when the uterus can no longer support the\r\nstretching, weight when the contents surpass its strength, and\r\nirritation when the fluids which had previously been pent up in the\r\nmembranes, flow out, on the rapture of these, into the uterus itself,\r\nor else when the whole foetus perishes, putrefies, and is resolved\r\ninto pernicious ichors, and so irritates and bites the coat of the\r\nuterus.\r\n\r\nIn all organs, then, both their natural effects and their disorders\r\nand maladies plainly take place on analogous lines,[359] some so\r\nclearly and manifestly as to need no demonstration, and others less\r\nplainly, although not entirely unrecognizable to those who are willing\r\nto pay attention.\r\n\r\nThus, to take the case of the stomach: the irritation is evident here\r\nbecause this organ possesses most sensibility, and among its other\r\naffections those producing nausea and the so-called heartburn clearly\r\ndemonstrate the eliminative faculty which expels foreign matter. So\r\nalso in the case of the uterus and the urinary bladder; this latter\r\nalso may be plainly observed to receive and accumulate fluid until it\r\nis so stretched by the amount of this as to be incapable of enduring\r\nthe pain; or it may be the quality of the urine which irritates it;\r\nfor every superfluous substance which lingers in the body must\r\nobviously putrefy, some in a shorter, and some in a longer time, and\r\nthus it becomes pungent, acrid, and burdensome to the organ which\r\ncontains it. This does not apply, however, in the case of the bladder\r\nalongside the liver, whence it is clear that it possesses fewer nerves\r\nthan do the other organs. Here too, however, at least the\r\nphysiologist[360] must discover an analogy. For since it was shown\r\nthat the gall-bladder attracts its own special juice, so as to be\r\noften found full, and that it discharges it soon after, this desire to\r\ndischarge must be either due to the fact that it is burdened by the\r\nquantity or that the bile has changed in quality to pungent and acrid.\r\nFor while food does not change its original quality so fast that it is\r\nalready ordure as soon as it falls into the small intestine, on the\r\nother hand the bile even more readily than the urine becomes altered\r\nin quality as soon as ever it leaves the veins, and rapidly undergoes\r\nchange and putrefaction. Now, if there be clear evidence in relation\r\nto the uterus, stomach, and intestines, as well as to the urinary\r\nbladder, that there is either some distention, irritation, or burden\r\ninciting each of these organs to elimination, there is no difficulty\r\nin imagining this in the case of the gall-bladder also, as well as in\r\nthe other organs,--to which obviously the arteries and veins also\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      XII\r\n\r\n  Nyni d' oudeteron toutôn prokeitai legein, alla tas\r\n  physikas dynameis monas apodeiknyein en hekastô tôn\r\n  organôn tettaras hyparchousas. epi tout' oun palin\r\n  epanelthontes anamnêsômen te tôn emprosthen eirêmenôn\r\n  epithômen te kephalên êdê tô logô panti to leipon eti\r\n  prosthentes. epeidê gar hekaston tôn en tô zôô moriôn\r\n  helkein eis heauto ton oikeion chymon apodedeiktai kai\r\n  prôtê schedon hautê tôn physikôn esti dynameôn, ephexês\r\n  || ekeinô gnôsteon, hôs ou proteron apotribetai tên           183\r\n  helchtheisan <trophên> êtoi sympasan ê kai ti perittôma autês,\r\n  prin an eis enantian metapesê diathesin ê auto to\r\n  organon ê kai tôn periechomenôn en autô ta pleista. hê\r\n  men oun gastêr, epeidan men hikanôs emplêsthê tôn sitiôn\r\n  kai to chrêstotaton autôn eis tous heautês chitônas\r\n  enapothêtai bdallousa, tênikaut' êdê to loipon\r\n  apotribetai kathaper achthos allotrion;

For obviously the inlet to the stomach does not\r\nmerely conduct food and drink into this organ, but in the condition of\r\nnausea it performs the opposite service. Further, the neck of the\r\nbladder which is beside the liver, albeit single, both fills and\r\nempties the bladder. Similarly the canal of the uterus affords an\r\nentrance to the semen and an exit to the foetus.\r\n\r\nBut in this latter case, again, whilst the eliminative faculty is\r\nevident, the attractive faculty is not so obvious to most people. It\r\nis, however, the cervix which Hippocrates blames for inertia of the\r\nuterus when he says:--\"Its orifice has no power of attracting\r\nsemen.\"[361]\r\n\r\nErasistratus, however, and Asclepiades reached such heights of wisdom\r\nthat they deprived not merely the stomach and the womb of this faculty\r\nbut also the bladder by the liver, and the kidneys as well. I have,\r\nhowever, pointed out in the first book that it is impossible to assign\r\nany other cause for the secretion of urine or bile.[362]\r\n\r\nNow, when we find that the uterus, the stomach and the bladder by the\r\nliver carry out attraction and expulsion through one and the same\r\nduct, we need no longer feel surprised that Nature should also\r\nfrequently discharge waste-substances into the stomach through the\r\nveins. Still less need we be astonished if a certain amount of the\r\nfood should, during long fasts, be drawn back from the liver into the\r\nstomach through the same veins[363] by which it was yielded up to the\r\nliver during absorption of nutriment.[364] To disbelieve such things\r\nwould of course be like refusing to believe that purgative drugs draw\r\ntheir appropriate humours from all over the body by the same stomata\r\nthrough which absorption previously takes place, and to look for\r\nseparate stomata for absorption and purgation respectively. As a\r\nmatter of fact one and the same stoma subserves two distinct\r\nfaculties, and these exercise their pull at different times in\r\nopposite directions--first it subserves the pull of the liver and,\r\nduring catharsis, that of the drug. What is there surprising, then, in\r\nthe fact that the veins situated between the liver and the region of\r\nthe stomach[365] fulfil a double service or purpose? Thus, when there\r\nis abundance of nutriment contained in the food-canal, it is carried\r\nup to the liver by the veins mentioned; and when the canal is empty\r\nand in need of nutriment, this is again attracted from the liver by\r\nthe same veins.\r\n\r\nFor everything appears to attract from and to go shares with\r\neverything else, and, as the most divine Hippocrates has said, there\r\nwould seem to be a consensus in the movements of fluids and\r\nvapours.[366] Thus the stronger draws and the weaker is evacuated.\r\n\r\nNow, one part is weaker or stronger than another either absolutely, by\r\nnature, and in all cases, or else it becomes so in such and such a\r\nparticular instance. Thus, by nature and in all men alike, the heart\r\nis stronger than the liver at attracting what is serviceable to it and\r\nrejecting what is not so; similarly the liver is stronger than the\r\nintestines and stomach, and the arteries than the veins. In each of us\r\npersonally, however, the liver has stronger drawing power at one time,\r\nand the stomach at another. For when there is much nutriment contained\r\nin the alimentary canal and the appetite and craving of the liver is\r\nviolent, then the viscus[367] exerts far the strongest traction.\r\nAgain, when the liver is full and distended and the stomach empty and\r\nin need, then the force of the traction shifts to the latter.\r\n\r\nSuppose we had some food in our hands and were snatching it from one\r\nanother; if we were equally in want, the stronger would be likely to\r\nprevail, but if he had satisfied his appetite, and was holding what\r\nwas over carelessly, or was anxious to share it with somebody, and if\r\nthe weaker was excessively desirous of it, there would be nothing to\r\nprevent the latter from getting it all. In a similar manner the\r\nstomach easily attracts nutriment from the liver when it [the stomach]\r\nhas a sufficiently strong craving for it, and the appetite of the\r\nviscus is satisfied. And sometimes the surplusage of nutriment in the\r\nliver is a reason why the animal is not hungry; for when the stomach\r\nhas better and more available food it requires nothing from extraneous\r\nsources, but if ever it is in need and is at a loss how to supply the\r\nneed, it becomes filled with waste-matters; these are certain biliary,\r\nphlegmatic [mucous] and serous fluids, and are the only substances\r\nthat the liver yields in response to the traction of the stomach, on\r\nthe occasions when the latter too is in want of nutriment.\r\n\r\nNow, just as the parts draw food from each other, so also they\r\nsometimes deposit their excess substances in each other, and just as\r\nthe stronger prevailed when the two were exercising traction, so it is\r\nalso when they are depositing; this is the cause of the so-called\r\nfluxions,[368] for every part has a definite inborn tension, by virtue\r\nof which it expels its superfluities, and, therefore, when one of\r\nthese parts,--owing, of course, to some special condition--becomes\r\nweaker, there will necessarily be a confluence into it of the\r\nsuperfluities from all the other parts. The strongest part deposits\r\nits surplus matter in all the parts near it; these again in other\r\nparts which are weaker; these next into yet others; and this goes on\r\nfor a long time, until the superfluity, being driven from one part\r\ninto another, comes to rest in one of the weakest of all; it cannot\r\nflow from this into another part, because none of the stronger ones\r\nwill receive it, while the affected part is unable to drive it away.\r\nWhen, however, we come to deal again with the origin and cure of\r\ndisease, it will be possible to find there also abundant proofs of all\r\nthat we have correctly indicated in this book. For the present,\r\nhowever, let us resume again the task that lay before us, _i.e._ to\r\nshow that there is nothing surprising in nutriment coming from the\r\nliver to the intestines and stomach by way of the very veins through\r\nwhich it had previously been yielded up from these organs into the\r\nliver. And in many people who have suddenly and completely given up\r\nactive exercise, or who have had a limb cut off, there occurs at\r\ncertain periods an evacuation of blood by way of the intestines--as\r\nHippocrates has also pointed out somewhere. This causes no further\r\ntrouble but sharply purges the whole body and evacuates the plethoras;\r\nthe passage of the superfluities is effected, of course, through the\r\nsame veins by which absorption took place.\r\n\r\nFrequently also in disease Nature purges the animal through these same\r\nveins--although in this case the discharge is not sanguineous, but\r\ncorresponds to the humour which is at fault. Thus in _cholera_ the\r\nentire body is evacuated by way of the veins leading to the intestines\r\nand stomach.\r\n\r\nTo imagine that matter of different kinds is carried in one direction\r\nonly would characterise a man who was entirely ignorant of all the\r\nnatural faculties, and particularly of the eliminative faculty, which\r\nis the opposite of the attractive. For opposite movements of matter,\r\nactive and passive, must necessarily follow opposite faculties; that\r\nis to say, every part, after it has attracted its special nutrient\r\njuice and has retained and taken the benefit of it hastens to get rid\r\nof all the surplusage as quickly and effectively as possible, and this\r\nit does in accordance with the mechanical tendency of this surplus\r\nmatter.[369]\r\n\r\nHence the stomach clears away by vomiting those superfluities which\r\ncome to the surface of its contents,[370] whilst the sediment it\r\nclears away by diarrhoea. And when the animal becomes sick, this means\r\nthat the stomach is striving to be evacuated by vomiting. And the\r\nexpulsive faculty has in it so violent and forcible an element that in\r\ncases of _ileus_ [volvulus], when the lower exit is completely closed,\r\nvomiting of faeces occurs; yet such surplus matter could not be\r\nemitted from the mouth without having first traversed the whole of the\r\nsmall intestine, the jejunum, the pylorus, the stomach, and the\r\noesophagus. What is there to wonder at, then, if something should also\r\nbe transferred from the extreme skin-surface and so reach the\r\nintestines and stomach? This also was pointed out to us by\r\nHippocrates, who maintained that not merely pneuma or excess-matter,\r\nbut actual nutriment is brought down from the outer surface to the\r\noriginal place from which it was taken up. For the slightest\r\nmechanical movements[371] determine this expulsive faculty, which\r\napparently acts through the transverse fibres, and which is very\r\nrapidly transmitted from the source of motion to the opposite\r\nextremities. It is, therefore, neither unlikely nor impossible that,\r\nwhen the part adjoining the skin becomes suddenly oppressed by an\r\nunwonted cold, it should at once be weakened and should find that the\r\nliquid previously deposited beside it without discomfort had now\r\nbecome more of a burden than a source of nutrition, and should\r\ntherefore strive to put it away. Finally, seeing that the passage\r\noutwards was shut off by the condensation [of tissue], it would turn\r\nto the remaining exit and would thus forcibly expel all the\r\nwaste-matter at once into the adjacent part; this would do the same to\r\nthe part following it; and the process would not cease until the\r\ntransference finally terminated at the inner ends of the veins.[372]\r\n\r\nNow, movements like these come to an end fairly soon, but those\r\nresulting from internal irritants (_e.g._, in the administration of\r\npurgative drugs or in cholera) become much stronger and more lasting;\r\nthey persist as long as the condition of things[373] about the mouths\r\nof the veins continues, that is, so long as these continue to attract\r\nwhat is adjacent. For this condition[374] causes evacuation of the\r\ncontiguous part, and that again of the part next to it, and this never\r\nstops until the extreme surface is reached; thus, as each part keeps\r\npassing on matter to its neighbour, the original affection[375] very\r\nquickly arrives at the extreme termination. Now this is also the case\r\nin _ileus_; the inflamed intestine is unable to support either the\r\nweight or the acridity of the waste substances and so does its best to\r\nexcrete them, in fact to drive them as far away as possible. And,\r\nbeing prevented from effecting an expulsion downwards when the\r\nseverest part of the inflammation is there, it expels the matter into\r\nthe adjoining part of the intestines situated above. Thus the tendency\r\nof the eliminative faculty is step by step upwards, until the\r\nsuperfluities reach the mouth.\r\n\r\nNow this will be also spoken of at greater length in my treatise on\r\ndisease. For the present, however, I think I have shewn clearly that\r\nthere is a universal conveyance or transference from one thing into\r\nanother, and that, as Hippocrates used to say, there exists in\r\neverything a consensus in the movement of air and fluids. And I do not\r\nthink that anyone, however slow his intellect, will now be at a loss\r\nto understand any of these points,--how, for instance, the stomach or\r\nintestines get nourished, or in what manner anything makes its way\r\ninwards from the outer surface of the body. Seeing that all parts have\r\nthe faculty of attracting what is suitable or well-disposed and of\r\neliminating what is troublesome or irritating, it is not surprising\r\nthat opposite movements should occur in them consecutively--as may be\r\nclearly seen in the case of the heart, in the various arteries, in the\r\nthorax, and lungs. In all these[376] the active movements of the\r\norgans and therewith the passive movements of [their contained]\r\nmatters may be seen taking place almost every second in opposite\r\ndirections. Now, you are not astonished when the trachea-artery[377]\r\nalternately draws air into the lungs and gives it out, and when the\r\nnostrils and the whole mouth act similarly; nor do you think it\r\nstrange or paradoxical that the air is dismissed through the very\r\nchannel by which it was admitted just before. Do you, then, feel a\r\ndifficulty in the case of the veins which pass down from the liver\r\ninto the stomach and intestines, and do you think it strange that\r\nnutriment should at once be yielded up to the liver and drawn back\r\nfrom it into the stomach by the same veins? You must define what you\r\nmean by this expression \"at once.\" If you mean \"at the same time\" this\r\nis not what we ourselves say; for just as we take in a breath at one\r\nmoment and give it out again at another, so at one time the liver\r\ndraws nutriment from the stomach, and at another the stomach from the\r\nliver. But if your expression \"at once\" means that in one and the same\r\nanimal a single organ subserves the transport of matter in opposite\r\ndirections, and if it is this which disturbs you, consider inspiration\r\nand expiration. For of course these also take place through the same\r\norgans, albeit they differ in their manner of movement, and in the way\r\nin which the matter is conveyed through them.\r\n\r\nNow the lungs, the thorax, the arteries rough and smooth, the heart,\r\nthe mouth, and the nostrils reverse their movements at very short\r\nintervals and change the direction of the matters they contain. On the\r\nother hand, the veins which pass down from the liver to the intestines\r\nand stomach reverse the direction of their movements not at such short\r\nintervals, but sometimes once in many days.\r\n\r\nThe whole matter, in fact, is as follows:--Each of the organs draws\r\ninto itself the nutriment alongside it, and devours all the useful\r\nfluid in it, until it is thoroughly satisfied; this nutriment, as I\r\nhave already shown, it stores up in itself, afterwards making it\r\nadhere and then assimilating it--that is, it becomes nourished by it.\r\nFor it has been demonstrated with sufficient clearness already[378]\r\nthat there is something which necessarily precedes actual nutrition,\r\nnamely _adhesion_, and that before this again comes _presentation_.\r\nThus as in the case of the _animals_ themselves the end of eating is\r\nthat the stomach should be filled, similarly in the case of each of\r\nthe _parts_, the end of presentation is the filling of this part with\r\nits appropriate liquid. Since, therefore, every part has, like the\r\nstomach, a _craving_[379] to be nourished, it too envelops its\r\nnutriment and clasps it all round as the stomach does. And this\r\n[action of the stomach], as has been already said, is necessarily\r\nfollowed by the digestion of the food, although it is not to make it\r\nsuitable for the other parts that the stomach contracts upon it; if it\r\ndid so, it would no longer be a physiological organ,[380] but an\r\nanimal possessing reason and intelligence, with the power of choosing\r\nthe better [of two alternatives].\r\n\r\nBut while the stomach contracts for the reason that the whole body\r\npossesses a power of attracting and of utilising appropriate\r\nqualities, as has already been explained, it also happens that, in\r\nthis process, the food undergoes alteration; further, when filled and\r\nsaturated with the fluid pabulum from the food, it thereafter looks on\r\nthe food as a burden; thus it at once gets rid of the excess--that is\r\nto say, drives it downwards--itself turning to another task, namely\r\nthat of causing adhesion. And during this time, while the nutriment is\r\npassing along the whole length of the _intestine_, it is caught up by\r\nthe vessels which pass into the intestine; as we shall shortly\r\ndemonstrate,[381] most of it is seized by the veins, but a little also\r\nby the arteries; at this stage also it becomes _presented_ to the\r\ncoats of the intestines.\r\n\r\nNow imagine the whole economy of nutrition divided into three periods.\r\nSuppose that in the first period the nutriment remains in the stomach\r\nand is digested and presented to the stomach until satiety is reached,\r\nalso that some of it is taken up from the stomach to the liver.[382]\r\n\r\nDuring the second period it passes along the intestines and becomes\r\npresented both to them and to the liver--again until the stage of\r\nsatiety--while a small part of it is carried all over the body.[382]\r\nDuring this period, also imagine that what was presented to the\r\nstomach in the first period becomes now adherent to it.\r\n\r\nDuring the third period the stomach has reached the stage of receiving\r\nnourishment; it now entirely assimilates everything that had become\r\nadherent to it: at the same time in the intestines and liver there\r\ntakes place adhesion of what had been before presented, while\r\ndispersal [anadosis] is taking place to all parts of the body,[383] as\r\nalso presentation. Now, if the animal takes food immediately after\r\nthese [three stages] then, during the time that the stomach is again\r\ndigesting and getting the benefit of this by presenting all the useful\r\npart of it to its own coats, the intestines will be engaged in final\r\nassimilation of the juices which have adhered to them, and so also\r\nwill the liver: while in the various parts of the body there will be\r\ntaking place adhesion of the portions of nutriment presented. And if\r\nthe stomach is forced to remain without food during this time, it will\r\ndraw its nutriment from the veins in the mesentery and liver; for it\r\nwill not do so from the actual body of the liver (by _body of the\r\nliver_ I mean first and foremost its flesh proper, and after this all\r\nthe vessels contained in it), for it is irrational to suppose that one\r\npart would draw away from another part the juice already contained in\r\nit, especially when adhesion and final assimilation of that juice were\r\nalready taking place; the juice, however, that is in the cavity of the\r\nveins will be abstracted by the part which is stronger and more in\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nIt is in this way, therefore, that the stomach, when it is in need of\r\nnourishment and the animal has nothing to eat, seizes it from the\r\nveins in the liver. Also in the case of the spleen we have shown in a\r\nformer passage[384] how it draws all material from the liver that\r\ntends to be thick, and by working it up converts it into more useful\r\nmatter. There is nothing surprising, therefore, if, in the present\r\ninstance also, some of this should be drawn from the spleen into such\r\norgans as communicate with it by veins, _e.g._ the omentum, mesentery,\r\nsmall intestine, colon, and the stomach itself. Nor is it surprising\r\nthat the spleen should disgorge its surplus matters into the stomach\r\nat one time, while at another time it should draw some of its\r\nappropriate nutriment from the stomach.\r\n\r\nFor, as has already been said, speaking generally, everything has the\r\npower at different times of attracting from and of adding to\r\neverything else. What happens is just as if you might imagine a number\r\nof animals helping themselves at will to a plentiful common stock of\r\nfood; some will naturally be eating when others have stopped, some\r\nwill be on the point of stopping when others are beginning, some\r\neating together, and others in succession. Yes, by Zeus! and one will\r\noften be plundering another, if he be in need while the other has an\r\nabundant supply ready to hand. Thus it is in no way surprising that\r\nmatter should make its way back from the outer surface of the body to\r\nthe interior, or should be carried from the liver and spleen into the\r\nstomach by the same vessels by which it was carried in the reverse\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the arteries[385] this is clear enough, as also in the\r\ncase of heart, thorax, and lungs; for, since all of these dilate and\r\ncontract alternately, it must needs be that matter is subsequently\r\ndischarged back into the parts from which it was previously drawn. Now\r\nNature foresaw this necessity,[386] and provided the cardiac openings\r\nof the vessels with membranous attachments,[387] to prevent their\r\ncontents from being carried backwards. How and in what manner this\r\ntakes place will be stated in my work \"On the Use of Parts,\" where\r\namong other things I show that it is impossible for the openings of\r\nthe vessels to be closed so accurately that nothing at all can run\r\nback. Thus it is inevitable that the reflux into the _venous\r\nartery_[388] (as will also be made clear in the work mentioned) should\r\nbe much greater than through the other openings. But what it is\r\nimportant for our present purpose to recognise is that every thing\r\npossessing a large and appreciable cavity must, when it dilates,\r\nabstract matter from all its neighbours, and, when it contracts, must\r\nsqueeze matter back into them. This should all be clear from what has\r\nalready been said in this treatise and from what Erasistratus and I\r\nmyself have demonstrated elsewhere respecting the tendency of a vacuum\r\nto become

together, therefore, the two facts--that the arteries have this\r\nmotion, and that everything, when it dilates, draws neighbouring\r\nmatter into itself--and you will find nothing strange in the fact that\r\nthose arteries which reach the skin draw in the outer air when they\r\ndilate, while those which anastomose at any point with the veins\r\nattract the thinnest and most vaporous part of the blood which these\r\ncontain, and as for those arteries which are near the heart, it is on\r\nthe heart itself that they exert their traction. For, by virtue of the\r\ntendency by which a vacuum becomes refilled, the lightest and thinnest\r\npart obeys the tendency before that which is heavier and thicker. Now\r\nthe lightest and thinnest of anything in the body is firstly pneuma,\r\nsecondly vapour, and in the third place that part of the blood which\r\nhas been accurately elaborated and refined.\r\n\r\nThese, then, are what the arteries draw into themselves on every side;\r\nthose arteries which reach the skin draw in the outer air[390] (this\r\nbeing near them and one of the lightest of things); as to the other\r\narteries, those which pass up from the heart into the neck, and that\r\nwhich lies along the spine, as also such arteries as are near\r\nthese--draw mostly from the heart itself; and those which are further\r\nfrom the heart and skin necessarily draw the lightest part of the\r\nblood out of the veins. So also the traction exercised by the diastole\r\nof the arteries which go to the stomach and intestines takes place at\r\nthe expense of the heart itself and the numerous veins in its\r\nneighbourhood; for these arteries cannot get anything worth speaking\r\nof from the thick heavy nutriment contained in the intestines and\r\nstomach,[391] since they first become filled with lighter elements.\r\nFor if you let down a tube into a vessel full of water and sand, and\r\nsuck the air out of the tube with your mouth, the sand cannot come up\r\nto you before the water, for in accordance with the principle of the\r\nrefilling of a vacuum the lighter matter is always the first to\r\nsucceed to the evacuation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      XIV\r\n\r\n  Alla mên kai hôs en hekastê tôn artêriôn esti tis\r\n  dynamis ek tês kardias epirrheousa, kath' hên\r\n  diastellontai te kai systellontai, dedeiktai di'\r\n  heterôn.\r\n\r\n  Eiper oun syntheiês amphô to te tautên einai tên kinêsin\r\n  autais to te pan to diastellomenon helkein ek tôn\r\n  plêsion eis heauto, thaumaston ouden soi phaneitai tas\r\n  artêrias, hosai men eis to derma perainousin autôn,\r\n  epispasthai ton exôthen aera diastellomenas, hosai de\r\n  kata ti pros tas || phlebas anestomôntai, to leptotaton       205\r\n  en autais kai atmôdestaton epispasthai tou haimatos,\r\n  hosai d' engys tês kardias eisin, ex autês ekeinês\r\n  poieisthai tên holkên. en gar tê pros to kenoumenon\r\n  akolouthia to kouphotaton te kai leptotaton hepetai\r\n  prôton tou baryterou te kai pachyterou; kouphotaton d'\r\n  esti kai leptotaton hapantôn tôn kata to sôma prôton men\r\n  to pneuma, deuteron d' ho atmos, epi toutô de triton,\r\n  hoson an akribôs ê kateirgasmenon te kai leleptysmenon\r\n  haima.\r\n\r\n  Taut' oun eis heautas helkousin hai artêriai\r\n  pantachothen, hai men eis to derma kathêkousai ton\r\n  exôthen aera; plêsion te gar autais houtos esti kai\r\n  kouphotatos en tois malista; tôn d' allôn hê men epi ton\r\n  trachêlon ek tês kardias aniousa kai hê kata rhachin,\r\n  êdê de kai hosai toutôn engys ex autês malista tês\r\n  kardias; hosai de kai tês kardias porrhôterô kai tou\r\n  dermatos, helkein tautais anankaion ek tôn phlebôn to\r\n  kouphotaton tou haimatos; hôste kai tôn eis tên gastera\r\n  te kai ta entera kathêkousôn artêriôn tên holkên en tô\r\n  diastellesthai gignesthai para te tês || kardias autês        206\r\n  kai tôn parakeimenôn autê phlebôn pampollôn ousôn. ou\r\n  gar dê ek ge tôn enterôn kai tês koilias trophên houtô\r\n  pacheian te kai bareian en heautois echontôn dynantai ti\r\n  metalambanein, ho ti kai axion logou, phthanousai\r\n  plêrousthai tois kouphoterois. oude gar ei katheis\r\n  auliskon eis angeion hydatos te kai psammou plêres\r\n  epispasaio tô stomati ton ek tou auliskou aera, dynait'\r\n  an akolouthêsai soi pro tou hydatos hê psammos; aei gar\r\n  en tê pros to kenoumenon akolouthia to kouphoteron\r\n  hepetai proteron.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              XV\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at, therefore, that only a very little\r\n[nutrient matter] such, namely, as has been accurately\r\nelaborated--gets from the stomach into the arteries, since these first\r\nbecome filled with lighter matter. We must understand that _there are\r\ntwo kinds of attraction_, that by which a vacuum becomes refilled and\r\nthat caused by appropriateness of quality;[392] air is drawn into\r\nbellows in one way, and iron by the lodestone in another. And we must\r\nalso understand that the traction which results from evacuation acts\r\nprimarily on what is light, whilst that from appropriateness of\r\nquality acts frequently, it may be, on what is heavier (if this should\r\nbe naturally more nearly related[393]). Therefore, in the case of the\r\nheart and the arteries, it is in so far as they are hollow organs,\r\ncapable of diastole, that they always attract the lighter matter\r\nfirst, while, in so far as they require nourishment, it is actually\r\ninto their _coats_ (which are the real _bodies_ of these organs) that\r\nthe appropriate matter is drawn.[394] Of the blood, then, which is\r\ntaken into their cavities when they dilate, that part which is most\r\nproper to them and most able to afford nourishment is attracted by\r\ntheir actual coats.\r\n\r\nNow, apart from what has been said,[395] the following is sufficient\r\nproof that something is taken over from the veins into the arteries.\r\nIf you will kill an animal by cutting through a number of its large\r\narteries, you will find the veins becoming empty along with the\r\narteries: now, this could never occur if there were not anastomoses\r\nbetween them. Similarly, also, in the heart itself, the thinnest\r\nportion of the blood is drawn from the right ventricle into the left,\r\nowing to there being perforations in the septum between them: these\r\ncan be seen for a great part [of their length]; they are like a kind\r\nof fossae [pits] with wide mouths, and they get constantly narrower;\r\nit is not possible, however, actually to observe their extreme\r\nterminations, owing both to the smallness of these and to the fact\r\nthat when the animal is dead all the parts are chilled and\r\nshrunken.[396] Here, too, however, our argument,[397] starting from\r\nthe principle that nothing is done by Nature in vain, discovers these\r\nanastomoses between the ventricles of the heart; for it could not be\r\nat random and by chance that there occurred fossae ending thus in\r\nnarrow terminations.\r\n\r\nAnd secondly [the presence of these anastomoses has been assumed] from\r\nthe fact that, of the two orifices in the right ventricle, the one\r\nconducting blood in and the other out, the former[398] is much the\r\nlarger. For, the fact that the insertion of the vena cava into the\r\nheart[399] is larger than the vein which is inserted into the\r\nlungs[400] suggests that not all the blood which the vena cava gives\r\nto the heart is driven away again from the heart to the lungs. Nor can\r\nit be said that any of the blood is expended in the nourishment of the\r\nactual body of the heart, since there is another vein[401] which\r\nbreaks up in it and which does not take its origin nor get its share\r\nof blood from the heart itself. And even if a certain amount is so\r\nexpended, still the vein leading to the lungs is not to such a slight\r\nextent smaller than that inserted into the heart as to make it likely\r\nthat the blood is used as nutriment for the heart: the disparity is\r\nmuch too great for such an explanation. It is, therefore, clear that\r\nsomething _is_ taken over into the left ventricle.[402]\r\n\r\nMoreover, of the two vessels connected with it, that which brings\r\npneuma into it from the lungs[403] is much smaller than the great\r\noutgrowing artery[404] from which the arteries all over the body\r\noriginate; this would suggest that it not merely gets pneuma from the\r\nlungs, but that it also gets blood from the right ventricle through\r\nthe anastomoses mentioned.\r\n\r\nNow it belongs to the treatise \"On the Use of Parts\" to show that it\r\nwas best that some parts of the body should be nourished by pure,\r\nthin, and vaporous blood, and others by thick, turbid blood, and that\r\nin this matter also Nature has overlooked nothing. Thus it is not\r\ndesirable that these matters should be further discussed. Having\r\nmentioned, however, that there are two kinds of attraction, certain\r\nbodies exerting attraction along wide channels during diastole (by\r\nvirtue of the principle by which a vacuum becomes refilled) and others\r\nexerting it by virtue of their appropriateness of quality, we must\r\nnext remark that the former bodies can attract even from a distance,\r\nwhile the latter can only do so from among things which are quite\r\nclose to them; the very longest tube let down into water can easily\r\ndraw up the liquid into the mouth, but if you withdraw iron to a\r\ndistance from the lodestone or corn from the jar (an instance of this\r\nkind has in fact been already given[405]) no further attraction can\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nThis you can observe most clearly in connection with _garden\r\nconduits_. For a certain amount of moisture is distributed from these\r\ninto every part lying close at hand but it cannot reach those lying\r\nfurther off: therefore one has to arrange the flow of water into all\r\nparts of the garden by cutting a number of small channels leading from\r\nthe large one. The intervening spaces between these small channels are\r\nmade of such a size as will, presumably, best allow them [the spaces]\r\nto satisfy their needs by drawing from the liquid which flows to them\r\nfrom every side. So also is it in the bodies of animals. Numerous\r\nconduits distributed through the various limbs bring them pure blood,\r\nmuch like the garden water-supply, and, further, the intervals between\r\nthese conduits have been wonderfully arranged by Nature from the\r\noutset so that the intervening parts should be plentifully provided\r\nfor when absorbing blood, and that they should never be deluged by a\r\nquantity of superfluous fluid running in at unsuitable times.\r\n\r\nFor the way in which they obtain nourishment is somewhat as follows.\r\nIn the body[406] which is continuous throughout, such as Erasistratus\r\nsupposes his _simple vessel_ to be, it is the superficial parts which\r\nare the first to make use of the nutriment with which they are brought\r\ninto contact; then the parts coming next draw their share from these\r\nby virtue of their contiguity; and again others from these; and this\r\ndoes not stop until the quality of the nutrient substance has been\r\ndistributed among all parts of the corpuscle in question. And for such\r\nparts as need the humour which is destined to nourish them to be\r\naltered still further, Nature has provided a kind of storehouse,\r\neither in the form of a central cavity or else as separate\r\ncaverns,[407] or something analogous to caverns. Thus the flesh of the\r\nviscera and of the muscles is nourished from the blood directly, this\r\nhaving undergone merely a slight alteration; the bones, however, in\r\norder to be nourished, require very great change, and what blood is to\r\nflesh marrow is to bone; in the case of the small bones, which do not\r\npossess central cavities, this marrow is distributed in their caverns,\r\nwhereas in the larger bones which do contain central cavities the\r\nmarrow is all concentrated in these.\r\n\r\nFor, as was pointed out in the first book,[408] things having a\r\nsimilar substance can easily change into one another, whereas it is\r\nimpossible for those which are very different to be assimilated to one\r\nanother without intermediate stages. Such a one in respect to\r\ncartilage is the myxoid substance which surrounds it, and in respect\r\nto ligaments, membranes, and nerves the viscous liquid dispersed\r\ninside them; for each of these consists of numerous fibres, which are\r\nhomogeneous[409]--in fact, actual _sensible elements_; and in the\r\nintervals between these fibres is dispersed the humour most suited for\r\nnutrition; this they have drawn from the blood in the veins, choosing\r\nthe most appropriate possible, and now they are assimilating it step\r\nby step and changing it into their own substance.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations, then, agree with one another, and bear\r\nsufficient witness to the truth of what has been already demonstrated;\r\nthere is thus no need to prolong the discussion further. For, from\r\nwhat has been said, anyone can readily discover in what way all the\r\nparticular [vital activities] come about. For instance, we could in\r\nthis way ascertain why it is that in the case of many people who are\r\npartaking freely of wine, the fluid which they have drunk is rapidly\r\nabsorbed[410] through the body and almost the whole of it is passed by\r\nthe kidneys within a very short time. For here, too, the rapidity with\r\nwhich the fluid is absorbed depends on appropriateness of quality, on\r\nthe thinness of the fluid, on the width of the vessels and their\r\nmouths, and on the efficiency of the attractive faculty. The parts\r\nsituated near the alimentary canal, by virtue of their appropriateness\r\nof quality, draw in the imbibed food for their own purposes, then the\r\nparts next to them in their turn snatch it away, then those next again\r\ntake it from these, until it reaches the vena cava, whence finally the\r\nkidneys attract that part of it which is proper to them. Thus it is in\r\nno way surprising that wine is taken up more rapidly than water, owing\r\nto its appropriateness of quality, and, further, that the white clear\r\nkind of wine is absorbed more rapidly owing to its thinness, while\r\nblack turbid wine, is checked on the way and retarded because of its\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nThese facts, also, will afford abundant proof of what has already been\r\nsaid about the arteries; everywhere, in fact, such blood as is both\r\nspecifically appropriate and at the same time thin in consistency\r\nanswers more readily to their traction than does blood which is not\r\nso; this is why the arteries which, in their diastole, absorb vapour,\r\npneuma, and thin blood attract either none at all or very little of\r\nthe juices contained in the stomach and intestines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       XV\r\n\r\n  Oukoun chrê thaumazein, ei pantelôs oligon ek tês\r\n  koilias, hoson an akribôs ê kateirgasmenon, eis tas\r\n  artêrias paragignetai phthanousas plêrousthai tôn\r\n  kouphoterôn, all' ekeino gignôskein, hôs dy' eston\r\n  holkês eidê, to men tê pros to kenoumenon akolouthia, to\r\n  d' oikeiotêti poiotêtos gignomenon;

Where an organ had no\r\n    obvious function, he dubbed it \"useless\"; _e.g._ the\r\n    spleen (_cf._ p. 143).\r\n\r\n    [321] _i.e._ contracting and dilating; no longitudinal\r\n    movements involved; _cf._ p. 263, note 2 (341).\r\n\r\n    [322] _cf._ p. 282, note 1 (356).\r\n\r\n    [323] Book II., chaps. ii. and viii.\r\n\r\n    [324] Note use of psychological terms in biology. _cf._\r\n    also p. 133, note 3 (191).\r\n\r\n    [325] \"In everything.\" _cf._ p. 66, note 3 (104).\r\n\r\n    [326] Galen confuses the nutrition of organs with that\r\n    of the ultimate living elements or cells; the stomach\r\n    does not, of course, feed itself in the way a cell does.\r\n    _cf._ Introduction, p. xxxii.\r\n\r\n    [327] _cf._ Asclepiades's theory regarding the urine, p.\r\n    51.\r\n\r\n    [328] The process of _application_ or _prosthesis_.\r\n    _cf._ p. 223, note 3 (301).\r\n\r\n    [329] Mutual influence of organism and environment.\r\n\r\n    [330] Qualitative change. _cf._ Book I., chap. ii.\r\n\r\n    [331] Apparently skin-diseases in which a superficial\r\n    crust (resembling the lichen on a tree-trunk)\r\n    forms--_e.g._ psoriasis.\r\n\r\n    [332] Note especially pneuma and innate heat, which\r\n    practically stand for oxygen and the heat generated in\r\n    oxidation. _cf._ p. 41, note 3 (70).\r\n\r\n    [333] Book I., chap. x.\r\n\r\n    [334] That is to say, faeces are obviously altered food.\r\n    This alteration cannot have taken place entirely in the\r\n    small intestine: therefore alteration of food must take\r\n    place in the stomach.\r\n\r\n    [335] _cf._ p. 39.\r\n\r\n    [336] Asclepiades held that there was no such thing as\r\n    real qualitative change; the food was merely broken up\r\n    into its constituent molecules, and absorbed unaltered.\r\n    _cf._ p. 49, note 5 (82).\r\n\r\n    [337] _i.e._ denial of forethought in the Physis.\r\n\r\n    [338] _v._ p. 9, _et passim_.\r\n\r\n    [339] _cf._ p. 97.\r\n\r\n    [340] It appears to me, from comparison between this and\r\n    other passages in Galen's writings (notably _Use of\r\n    Parts_, iv., 8), that he means by the \"two coats\" simply\r\n    the mucous and the muscular coats. In this case the\r\n    \"straight\" or \"longitudinal\" fibres of the inner coat\r\n    would be the _rugae_; the \"circular\" fibres of the inner\r\n    intestinal coat would be the _valvulae conniventes_.\r\n\r\n    [341] The term here rendered _peristalsis_ is\r\n    _peristolé_ in Greek; it is applied only to the\r\n    intermittent movements of muscles placed circularly\r\n    round a lumen or cavity, and comprehends _systolé_ or\r\n    contraction and _diastolé_ or dilatation. In its modern\r\n    significance, _peristalsis_, however, also includes the\r\n    movements of _longitudinal_ fibres. _cf._ p. 97, note 1\r\n    (146).\r\n\r\n    [342] _i.e._ those containing non-striped or\r\n    \"involuntary\" muscle fibres; organs governed by the\r\n    \"natural\" pneuma; _cf._ p. 186, note 3 (265).\r\n\r\n    [343] By this term is meant only what we should call the\r\n    \"voluntary\" muscles.\r\n\r\n    [344] _cf._ p. 97.\r\n\r\n    [345] For \"symptom,\" _cf._ p. 13, and p. 12, note 3\r\n    (24). \"Transitum namque materiae per angustum corpus id\r\n    accidens consequitur\" (Linacre).

Thompson). _cf._ Aristotle's _Nat.

A._, VIII., ii., 591 B, 5.\r\n\r\n    [350] Under the term \"neura,\" tendons were often\r\n    included as well as nerves. Similarly in modern Dutch\r\n    the word _zenuw_ (\"sinew\") means both a tendon and a\r\n    nerve; _zenuwachtig_ = \"nervous.\"\r\n\r\n    [351] Rather than the alternative reading, [Greek: ton\r\n    esôthen chitôna]. Galen apparently supposes that the\r\n    outer coat will not be damaged, as the cuts will pass\r\n    _between_ its fibres. These cuts would be, presumably,\r\n    short ones, at various levels, no single one of them\r\n    involving the whole circumference of the gullet.\r\n\r\n    [352] _cf._ p. 205.\r\n\r\n    [353] Thus Galen elsewhere calls the spleen a mere\r\n    _emunctory_ ([Greek: ekmageion]) of the liver. _cf._ p.\r\n    214, note 1 (295).\r\n\r\n    [354] _cf._ p. 269.\r\n\r\n    [355] The urinary bladders of pigs (such as Galen\r\n    dissected) are thin, and appear to have only one coat.\r\n\r\n    [356] _cf._ p. 243.\r\n\r\n    [357] My suggestion is that Galen refers to (1) the\r\n    _mucous_ coat, with its _valvulae conniventes_, and (2)\r\n    the _muscular_ coat, of which the chief layer is made up\r\n    of circular fibres. _cf._ p. 262, note 1 (340).\r\n\r\n    [358] Or _utility_.\r\n\r\n    [359] Relationship between physiology and pathology\r\n    again emphasized. _cf._ p. 188, note 2 (267).\r\n\r\n    [360] Or physicist--the investigator of the Physis or\r\n    Nature. _cf._ p. 196, note 2 (274).
