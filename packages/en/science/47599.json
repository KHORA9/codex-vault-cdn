BOHN, 4, YORK STREET, COVENT GARDEN.\r\n\r\nMDCCCXXXVII.\r\n\r\n{iii}PREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESENT EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acknowledged value of the figures contained in Drury's\r\n\"Illustrations,\"[1] the extreme rarity of many of the insects figured\r\ntherein, which continue up to the present day to be unique, and the\r\nscarcity of the work itself, which appears almost unknown to Continental\r\nEntomologists, having induced the proprietor of the plates to republish the\r\nwork, I have consented to undertake the charge of bringing it forth in a\r\nform more adapted to the present greatly advanced state of Entomology. How\r\nfar I have succeeded must be left for the candid Entomologist to decide. It\r\nis fit however that, by way of bespeaking indulgence for the numerous\r\nerrors into which I fear that I have, notwithstanding all my care, fallen,\r\nI should mention the obstacles which have operated against my giving the\r\nwork that perfect style which I could have wished it to possess. Of these\r\nthe chief difficulty has arisen from the non-possession of the specimens\r\nwhich served for the original illustrations, without which it may be\r\nreadily conceived that it has been impossible to ascertain with precision\r\nmany of the more minute characters, of which the present state of the\r\nscience requires the investigation; thus in many cases I have been obliged\r\nto remain in ignorance of the particular structure of the antennæ, trophi\r\nand legs, and the disposition of the veins of the wings, in many of the\r\nsmaller species of Lepidoptera, so that the precise genera may not in some\r\ninstances be correctly stated; and to many I have been compelled to attach\r\nmarks of interrogation for the like reason. Another and equally strong\r\nobstacle has been produced from the little attention paid to exotic\r\n{iv}Lepidoptera by modern Entomologists. More than two-thirds of these\r\nIllustrations are illustrative of that beautiful order of insects; and yet,\r\nwith the exception of some of the showy butterflies and moths, scarcely a\r\nreference is to be found even in the works of Fabricius, the personal\r\nfriend of Drury, whose Entomologia Systematica, published in 1793 and 1794,\r\ncontains the last general summary of the species of this order; Gmelin\r\nalso, whose Systema Naturæ it has been the fashion to decry, but which, as\r\na laborious compilation from the works of preceding and chiefly Continental\r\nauthors, is of great service,[2] was only acquainted with these\r\nillustrations through the early works of Fabricius.[3] It is true that M.\r\nM. Boisduval and Guérin have respectively published various new exotic\r\nLepidoptera, especially of the Nocturnal group, in the Voyages of the\r\nCoquille and Astrolabe; but we still want a general revision, not only of\r\nthe species but of the genera of this order. It was to have been hoped\r\nthat, as regarded the Javanese species, this would have been effected by\r\nDr. Horsfield, whose work upon the Lepidoptera of Java, as far as\r\npublished, leaves nothing to be desired of the structural details of the\r\nspecies illustrated therein. M. Boisduval also, in his Histoire Naturelle\r\ndes Lépidoptères, has treated the subject in a masterly manner, availing\r\nhimself both of the preparatory states and veining of the wings; but we\r\ngreatly miss those beautiful details which render the works of Horsfield\r\nand Curtis invaluable. It is in this comparative ignorance, both of the\r\nstructural and metamorphotic details of exotic Lepidoptera, that we may\r\nattribute the want of a sound and philosophical distribution of the order\r\nin question; and which at the same time prevents us from determining the\r\nsituation of many remarkable and anomalous groups. Of these the genera\r\nCastnia, Urania, &c. and the whole tribe of the Zygænidæ may especially be\r\nmentioned; and it is with the view of inciting enquiry into this part of\r\nthe subject, that I have introduced many of the latter species into the\r\ngenus Callimorpha amongst the Nocturnal moths.\r\n\r\nAnother obstacle has been produced by the little attention paid by the\r\nEntomologists of the last century to the geographical situation of their\r\ninsects; as an instance of this, it will be sufficient to mention that\r\nLinnæus and Fabricius made use of the term \"In Indiis\" generally, to\r\nindicate that an insect was an inhabitant either of the West or East\r\nIndies. Drury indeed appears to have paid more than the ordinary degree of\r\nattention to this part of the subject, as appears from the Catalogue of his\r\nInsects, which I obtained at the sale of Mr. Donovan's collections, to\r\nwhom, as appears by a note, they were presented by Mr. Drury. Thus under\r\nLucanus interruptus, (Genus Passalus, Fabricius,) we find the {v}following\r\nentries:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  7.  3. Interruptus,     Muskito Shore,  Capt.

Rio Janeiro,    Mr. Bonifas, 1775, that on the\r\n                                            right hand from Mr. Laing, at\r\n                                            Tobago.\r\n  12.    Interrupt. var.                  Bought at Seymour's sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere it is quite evident that Drury had carefully noted down the localities\r\nof all the specimens of this insect which he possessed, and which are now\r\ndescribed as distinct species; and this extract will I think be quite\r\nsufficient to shew, that from the careful manner in which these Catalogues\r\nwere kept by Mr. Drury, we are entitled to regard them, when there happens\r\nto be a difference between the works of Drury and Fabricius, Linnæus, &c.\r\nas at least of equal authority with the writings of these authors. I regret\r\nthat these Catalogues did not come into my hands until after the first and\r\nsecond volumes of this edition were printed off. I have incorporated the\r\nnotes in the third volume; and have given, as an Appendix, extracts from\r\nthese Catalogues, where there happens to be any variation or doubt as to\r\nthe locality of any of the species figured in the first two volumes.\r\n\r\nI have almost invariably adopted the very proper principle of referring to\r\nthat name, either generic or specific, which has the priority in point of\r\ndate. In the first edition, the first volume appeared without specific\r\nnames, which were at that time a novelty but recently introduced by\r\nLinnæus. In the second volume, however, an appendix was given, containing\r\nspecific names both of the first and second volumes, and a similar appendix\r\nwas given at the end of the third volume; but no specific names appeared in\r\nthe body of the work. To many of the names contained in the appendices\r\nFabricius referred, many he entirely omitted, and for many he substituted\r\nothers. These last I have of course rejected; and have in many instances\r\ngiven the dates when the names were first imposed by the different\r\nauthors--a plan which would be very serviceable if generally adopted. I\r\nhave, likewise, made a point in many cases of restoring the specific\r\n_proper_ names, where, in consequence of a change in the sex of the generic\r\nname, a corresponding change had been made in such specific name. This\r\nalteration had been carried to a great extent in the Encyclopédie\r\nMéthodique; and many male and female _proper_ names had been completely\r\naltered, in order to suit them to the sex of the new genera in which they\r\nwere placed. This was, however, an error on the wrong side; because it is\r\nadmitted as an established principle, that if it should be thought\r\nnecessary to subdivide a genus, the names of the subdivisions should be of\r\nthe sex of the original generic name.\r\n\r\nThe plan upon which the first edition of this work was published may be\r\nseen from the following specimen, which is one of the shortest given, but\r\nwhich will be sufficient to shew not only the style of the former edition,\r\nbut also the manner in which I have treated the subject and the additions\r\nwhich I have introduced.\r\n\r\n{vi}Vol. I. Plate II.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Fig. III.--Expands about three inches.\r\n\r\n  _Upper Side._--The antennæ are black. The head, thorax, and abdomen\r\n  brown. All the wings (the edges of which are even not dentated) are of a\r\n  deep brown, with a shade of clay colour, rising near the anterior edges\r\n  of the superior ones, runs along near the tips and ends at the external\r\n  edges.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._--The eyes are black, the palpi yellow. All the wings are\r\n  the same brown colour as the upper side, with the clay-coloured shade\r\n  near the tips as on that. The superior wings have five whitish spots on\r\n  each placed on a row near the external edges, the inferior ones have on\r\n  each sometimes five and sometimes seven spots of the same colour placed\r\n  in a circular row, that meets near the extremity of the body.\r\n\r\n  I received it from China. I cannot find it any where described.\r\n\r\n  Fig. III.--Il deploye ses aîles environ trois pouces.\r\n\r\n  _Le Dessus._--Les antennes sont noires. La tête le corcelet et l'abdomen\r\n  bruns. Les aîles (dont les bords sont unis ou point dentélés) sont d'une\r\n  couleur brune foncée, avec une nuance couleur d'argille se levant proche\r\n  des bords antérieurs des aîles supérieures, qui court le long près des\r\n  bouts et finit aux bords extérieurs.\r\n\r\n  _Le Dessous._--Les yeux sont noires, les antennules jaunes. Toutes les\r\n  aîles sont de la même couleur brune que en dessus, avec la nuance\r\n  d'argille proche des bouts chacune des aîles supérieures a cinq taches\r\n  blanchâtres, placées sur une ligne près des bords extérieurs. Les\r\n  inférieures ont chacune quelquefois cinq et quelquefois sept taches de la\r\n  même couleur rangées circulairment et se rencontrant près de l'extrémité\r\n  du corps.\r\n\r\n  Il l'ai reçue de la Chine. Je ne le trouve point décrit.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of Papilio Eumeus was consequently proposed for this insect in the\r\nAppendix to the second volume.\r\n\r\nAmongst the manuscripts with which I have been favoured by the relatives of\r\nMr. Drury, or have obtained elsewhere, are comprised a variety of notes\r\nrelative to the publication of this work, and of observations from which\r\nthe following are selected. He notices that \"his _descriptions_ are only\r\nintended to assist the reader in ascertaining the different species; and\r\nthat they are not intended to be so complete as to give a perfect idea of\r\nthe animal without the help of the figure.\" He alludes to the difficulty\r\nnot only \"of ascertaining true colours or calling them by their proper\r\nnames,\" but also of \"colouring the prints so, as to exactly represent the\r\nnatural specimens,\"--that he has mentioned and given English names to no\r\nmore parts of insects than had suited his purpose for describing\r\nthem,--that \"there are some parts mentioned in the descriptions which\r\ncannot be seen in the plates, such as the Gorget (Sternum), &c. which may\r\nserve not only to assist in classing them, but to ascertain their species.\"\r\n\"The descriptions of the Hymenoptera are not intended to be so complete as\r\nto give a perfect idea of the insect, but are only given to assist the\r\nreader in observing the figures.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the descriptions are taken from the insects themselves; whatever\r\ndefects, therefore, are to be observed in comparing them with the coloured\r\nfigures must be imputed to the artist, as it would not be proper to\r\ndescribe them according to the prints, but to {vii}nature.\"--It is in\r\nconsequence of this last remark that I have been careful to omit nothing of\r\nthe original edition in this edition of the least importance, but have\r\ngiven the description as much as possible in the words of the author\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nI have also added a general Systematic Index to the entire work, and an\r\nAlphabetic Index, in which the names employed in the first edition are\r\ndistinguished by an asterisk.\r\n\r\nThe collection formed by Drury was exceedingly choice, and had occupied\r\nnearly thirty years in its formation; for although, as Drury himself says\r\n(in one of the printed circulars which he distributed with a view to its\r\nsale) \"there may be in Holland collections more numerous, having in many\r\ninstances a great number of a single species, yet no collection abounds\r\nwith such a wonderful variety in all the different genera as this. All the\r\nspecimens of which it is composed, are in the highest and most exquisite\r\nstate of preservation, such an extensive collection can be supposed to be,\r\nand a very considerable number are _unique_, such as are not to be found in\r\nany other Cabinet whatever, and of considerable value; many of which,\r\ncoming from countries exceedingly unhealthy, where the collectors, in\r\nprocuring them, have perished by the severity of the climate, give but\r\nlittle room to expect any duplicate will ever be obtained during the\r\npresent age; and the learned quotations that have been taken from it by\r\nthose celebrated authors Linnæus and Fabricius, in all their late editions,\r\nare incontestable proofs of the high degrees of estimation they entertained\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement was made in 1788, when the author had consumed upwards of\r\ntwenty-five years in its formation, and at which period no less a sum than\r\n£4,000. had been expended upon the collection. At this period the\r\ncollection consisted of--\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Subjects.   Different Species.\r\n  Coleoptera            2218        2136\r\n  Hemiptera              895         778\r\n  Lepidoptera           2462        2148\r\n  Neuroptera             172         171\r\n  Hymenoptera            533         533\r\n  Diptera                552         402\r\n  Aptera                 105          96\r\n  English Collection    2641        2070\r\n                        ----        ----\r\n                        9578        8370\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently great additions were made to the collection, which, as will be\r\nseen from the localities affixed to the species figured in these\r\nIllustrations was received from all parts of the world with which England\r\nat that period had intercourse. Of the earnest zeal with which this\r\ncollection was made, an idea may be obtained from a copy of a letter\r\naddressed to a gentleman residing in Africa, with whom he was anxious to\r\nenter into correspondence.\r\n\r\n  _London, Dec. 13th_, 1766.\r\n\r\n      SIR,\r\n\r\n  My being an utter stranger to you compels me to apologize for the liberty\r\n  I take in sending you this. Mr. Carghill's recommendation is the occasion\r\n  of my doing so, and he has assured me of your {viii}kind disposition to\r\n  oblige me in those articles that are the subject of the following lines;\r\n  I must therefore inform you that I am engaged in the study of Natural\r\n  History, but as the extensiveness of it in all its several parts is very\r\n  great, I confine myself entirely to one single branch, and that is\r\n  Insects. A branch I find fully sufficient to engage my attention without\r\n  entering into any of the others, and in consequence of this I am\r\n  endeavouring to obtain as large a collection of foreign ones as I\r\n  possibly can; to this end I am under a necessity of getting various\r\n  recommendations from my friends to gentlemen settled in foreign parts,\r\n  who I must consider as the only persons that can effectually assist me in\r\n  this scheme. Permit me therefore, Sir, to beg your concurrence herein,\r\n  and if the highest ideas of gratitude can prompt a man to make an\r\n  adequate return for any favour of this kind, be assured I shall take the\r\n  earliest opportunity of manifesting mine for any thing you shall think\r\n  proper to oblige me with. The great distance the continent of Africa is\r\n  situated from London, the ignorance we labour under of its produce in the\r\n  insect world, and the great difficulty I have found in procuring any\r\n  insects from those parts, are circumstances that rather increase than\r\n  blunt my desire for them; but as in the course of fourteen years I have\r\n  not been able to procure any great number, I can only attribute this\r\n  disappointment to my having never been able to apply to any gentleman\r\n  settled there, for the persons that I have hitherto commissioned to this\r\n  purpose were those that returned with the ships they went in, and I\r\n  imagine their time was too short to be able to procure such things for\r\n  me; but as Mr. Carghill has informed me your residence in Africa will\r\n  afford you many leisure hours, permit me to indulge the hope of your\r\n  complying with this request. It is necessary for me to inform you that\r\n  there is no occasion for your bestowing any time of your own in this\r\n  pursuit, as I imagine it might be done by people to be hired in Africa to\r\n  that purpose for a very trifle; and as it is necessary I should inform\r\n  you where and in what manner insects in general are to be taken, give me\r\n  leave therefore to explain the use of the things I have sent for that\r\n  purpose: you will observe the bows of the forceps being covered with\r\n  gauze, and folding so close together as to prevent any small insect's\r\n  getting out when once enclosed, constitutes a contrivance the best\r\n  adapted of any thing I ever saw for that purpose, it is small enough to\r\n  be carried in the pocket, and if you have curiosity enough to employ an\r\n  hour in this amusement, permit me to say you will have a scene of wonders\r\n  opened to you in the insect world, you will have such a number of objects\r\n  of speculation present themselves, that will amaze you. When an insect is\r\n  inclosed in these nets it is to be stuck through the body with a pin (I\r\n  have sent some for this purpose), and in that manner placed in the box,\r\n  whose top and bottom are lined with cork. Suffer me to beg of you (if you\r\n  will be so obliging to procure me some of those things) to get a larger\r\n  box made in Africa of soft wood, in which a pin will easily enter, and\r\n  replace the insects out of the oval box now sent into that, and when\r\n  filled I will entreat you to commit it to the care of a friend to be\r\n  conveyed to England, giving him at the same time a charge to keep it from\r\n  being tumbled about by the rolling of the ship, which will certainly\r\n  damage the contents, and favouring me with a letter of advice; it is\r\n  necessary to beg you to paste a slip of fine linen or paper all round the\r\n  crevice and opening of the box, to prevent the cockroaches, ants, &c.\r\n  getting in, who will infallibly damage and destroy the insects in it; I\r\n  forgot to mention that they should not be removed out of the oval box\r\n  into the great one till they are dead, because they will scratch and tear\r\n  one another to pieces, therefore when the person comes home from\r\n  collecting, they may be taken out singly and stuck on a piece of board or\r\n  stick, and held close to the fire (not so as to burn or scorch them), and\r\n  this in less than a minute will effectually kill them, afterwards they\r\n  may be stuck very close together in the large box, and in that manner\r\n  sent to England. I will just mention what kinds will be most acceptable,\r\n  and where they are to be found, viz. beetles or insects with hard cased\r\n  wings, insects with transparent wings, such as wasps, {ix}bees,\r\n  waterflies, also locusts or grasshoppers, ants, fireflies, or in short\r\n  any kind except cockroaches, centipedes, or scorpions, which in general\r\n  are so very common they cease to be valuable--of all the other kinds\r\n  there is an infinite variety, differing in size, shape, and colour, any\r\n  of which will be very acceptable, either large or small; and of which,\r\n  give me leave to observe, the most ugly disagreeable insects (as they\r\n  appear to be) are the most desirable. They are found in various places,\r\n  some on flowers, some in horse-dung or cow-dung, some under stones and\r\n  logs of wood, some under the bark of trees where it separates or divides\r\n  itself from the body, which by tearing up will expose many kinds to view;\r\n  but no place abounds more than rotten trees, for there they hide and\r\n  secrete themselves in holes among the rotten wood, and are never seen\r\n  unless they are searched for. Let me here observe, that the different\r\n  seasons will yield different species of insects, some being to be found\r\n  in one week that were not to be seen the preceding ones, and the next\r\n  will afford others differing from the former, while the succeeding one\r\n  shall produce some other sorts that were not to be seen before; so that\r\n  by searching for them at different times, you perceive great varieties\r\n  will be collected. I must also beg you to preserve the horns of them as\r\n  much as possible, as they in a great measure determine their genus, and\r\n  as such should not be broke off. The insects placed in the box will serve\r\n  as samples to show the person you may hire what kinds of things are meant\r\n  to be collected, who for want of them might not be able to understand\r\n  your instructions.\r\n\r\n  I have now, Sir, mentioned every article necessary to be known, therefore\r\n  shall conclude with once more begging you to assist me in this scheme;\r\n  and if there is any business, or any other thing, in which I can be\r\n  serviceable to you here, I beg you would command me; but if there is\r\n  nothing of that kind by which I can express my gratitude, permit me again\r\n  to repeat I shall take the first opportunity of making a return fully\r\n  adequate to your favour.\r\n\r\n    I am, Sir, with great respect, your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                       D. DRURY,\r\n                         At No. 1. in Love Lane, Aldermanbury,\r\n                                       London.\r\n\r\n  P. S.

The former dedicated a fine species\r\nof Cimex to Drury, figured in the first volume of these Illustrations, pl.\r\n42. f. 1. 5.; whilst the latter described an American species of Stenocorus\r\nfrom Drury's collection, under the name of St. Drurii (Ent. Syst. 1. 2. p.\r\n302.) and also a Danish Tinea under the name of T. Drurella. The Rev. W.\r\nKirby also in his Monograph upon the English Bees, has named a rare species\r\nbelonging to the modern genus Eucera, Apis Drurella, with the remark--\"In\r\nhonorem D. Drury, operis entomologici splendidissimi auctoris, cujus museum\r\ninsectorum rarissimorum undique conquisitorum gazophylacium ditissimum,\r\nhanc apem ab illo acceptam nominavi.\" (Mon. Ap. Angl. 2. p. 286.)\r\n\r\nThat Drury was in correspondence with these \"Heroes Scientiæ\" will\r\ntherefore be unquestioned; and the following letter from the younger\r\nLinnæus, communicated to me by the relatives of the former is interesting\r\nnot only on this account, but for the curious statement relative to the\r\nOestrus humanus then recently discovered in South America.\r\n\r\n  Celeberrimo Viro D.

Drury, Goldsmith in the Strand, in London.\r\n\r\nMy late friend A. H. Haworth, Esq. thus spoke of Drury and his works in the\r\nyear 1807. \"In the year 1770 we arrive at the time of publication of a\r\nbeautiful work on Entomology, that of my late and regretted friend D.\r\nDrury, F.L.S. in one vol. 4to. printed at London, and containing\r\ncomprehensive descriptions in English and French, with an Index of Linnæan\r\nnames at the end, and a great many coloured copper-plates of such\r\ninteresting exotic Insects, as had not been before or insufficiently\r\nfigured. The icons were executed by Moses Harris, in his best style; and\r\nare far superior to any of their predecessors in Britain.\r\n\r\n\"It is also unquestionably the first work in this country in which the\r\ntrivial names of Linnæus are suffered to make their appearance, and\r\nalthough only given in the shape of an index, their extensive value throws\r\na lustre on the utility of the work, which, unaided by them, would not have\r\nreached a second volume, published in 1773, and a third in 1782; and even a\r\nfourth would have appeared if the author had lived much longer;[6] as he\r\nhimself assured me, some time prior to his decease; wherein would have been\r\ndelineated some of the gigantic and extraordinary insects of Demerara, in\r\nwhich remote territory he had successfully employed a collecting agent. Mr.\r\nDrury's Cabinet was one of the most extensive ever made; and is said to\r\nhave contained, in species and varieties, the surprising number of 11,000\r\ninsects. He spared neither pains nor cost in getting them together, and\r\nlike Petiver of old, sent printed instructions, in various languages, all\r\nover the world for that purpose, by captains of ships and others.\r\n\r\n\"Soon after his decease, at an advanced age, which happened about two years\r\nsince, his valuable collection was disposed of in London, by public\r\nauction.\"--(Trans. Ent. Soc. Vol. I. 1807. p. 34.)\r\n\r\nThe decease of Mr. Dru Drury occurred on the 15th of January, 1804, at the\r\nage of eighty, and he was buried at the parish church of St. Martins in the\r\nFields.\r\n\r\nJ. O. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{xii}MR. DRURY'S PREFACE\r\n\r\nTO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nVOL. I.\r\n\r\nIt is universally allowed that the study of nature is one of the most\r\npleasing employments that can engage the mind of man. The entertainment it\r\naffords is as infinite as the variety of subjects of which it is composed;\r\nand such a vast field of speculation lies open to our view, either in the\r\nanimal, vegetable, or mineral worlds, that each of them is fully sufficient\r\nto engross the attention of a single person. It must be allowed, that the\r\nstudy of natural history is so far from having attained that degree of\r\nperfection it might have done, by the assiduity of the curious, that it\r\ncannot, at present, be considered as having attained its meridian; and the\r\nslow manner in which it arrived even to that, has subjected us very much to\r\nthe reflections of foreigners; many of whom appear surprised, that a\r\nnation, not inferior to others in every branch of science and knowledge,\r\nshould discover so great a want of curiosity, and little attention to a\r\nstudy that has been productive of so many advantages to mankind, and\r\nprobably, may hereafter produce many more. Certainly, such opportunities\r\nfor improvement never presented themselves in this kingdom, as in the\r\npresent age. All corners of the world are visited by our ships; the\r\nremotest shores of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America, are not unknown to\r\nour countrymen; but feel the effects of that insatiable thirst for traffic\r\nand gain, that animates the present generation. Every lover, therefore, of\r\nthis study must naturally hope, that such noble occasions of increasing the\r\nknowledge of nature, may not be neglected. It is indeed true, that the\r\nnumber of its votaries, in England, are but few, in proportion to other\r\nstates, where professorships and societies are established under the\r\npatronage and protection of the chief personages: yet if we consider it as\r\naffording an inconceivable fund of entertainment to its followers, it is\r\nrather to be wondered it is not more encouraged and propagated among us,\r\nthan that we should find a few who have resolution enough to judge for\r\nthemselves, and follow a study that is always new and always pleasing. The\r\nsneers and contempt thrown on it by men of narrow minds, who are impatient\r\nat hearing of persons bestowing their time in collecting a plant, an\r\ninsect, or a stone, may perhaps contribute {xiii}not a little to prevent\r\nits progress; but whatever character may be stamped, either upon the study,\r\nor its professors, by such persons; it is certain, none but men fit to be\r\nplaced in the first rank, have usually philosophy enough to prompt them to\r\nmake enquiries into the works of nature. To some the task appears too\r\narduous, to others too intricate, and to the generality too trifling; who\r\nare apt to look with contempt on every pursuit that does not coincide with\r\ntheir own opinions; nor must we, from vulgar minds, expect any conclusions\r\nin its favour: with these, a horse, a dog, or a cock, seem to bound the\r\nutmost limits of their gratifications. But men of refined tastes will judge\r\notherways. They know that the inexhaustible store of entertainment nature\r\naffords in the contemplation of her works, is unbounded. It is not to be\r\nenjoyed all at once; the more we pursue, the more we shall possess, in\r\nproportion as we manifest a greater or less ardour. Nor is the serene\r\nplacid enjoyment found therein, to be measured by the common gratifications\r\nof sense; as these often leave stings behind that worry the soul, and\r\nsubvert the end they intended to promote; while the other offers to us its\r\nfriendly aid, replete with happiness, health, and peace. And further, if\r\nthe contemplation of the works of the Sovereign Architect, tends to promote\r\nthat serious and attentive state of mind which disposes men to the pursuit\r\nof virtue, in order to be happy; and if the knowledge and practice of\r\nvirtue are the means of supporting the mind through all the difficult\r\npassages and rugged paths of life; the naturalist bids as fair to be happy\r\nas any of the human race. His pleasures are not chequered by remorse, or\r\ndamped by despair; his pursuits leave no horrors on the mind, or clash with\r\nthe duty he owes his Maker, his neighbour, or his prince; his conscience\r\nsuffers not for the indulgence of his mind, nor has repentance need to\r\nstalk behind him with an uplifted arm, for injustice committed on his\r\nfellow-creatures; on the contrary, it is for them ultimately his labours\r\nare pursued, for them he inquires into the various arcana of nature; every\r\npart of the earth is searched for their benefit, and its bowels are torn\r\nout and examined for their advantage.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if we consider natural history as connected with\r\nreligion, we shall find them so interwoven and blended together as not to\r\nbe separated. In this view we shall find it the best adapted for opening\r\nthe mind, enlarging its conceptions, and giving us the most exalted ideas\r\nof the Deity, of any science whatever, astronomy not excepted, whose study,\r\nhowever noble it may be thought, tends not more to the same improvement;\r\nfor certainly the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Almighty are as\r\nconspicuous in the smallest objects, as those of the first magnitude, if\r\n_great_ and _little_ be only relative terms. If, therefore, natural history\r\nis able to accomplish this, nothing surely can afford a more effectual cure\r\nfor infidelity. For whoever heard of a naturalist being an atheist? or of\r\nan infidel, who had spent his life in studying and observing the works of\r\nnature? I believe none will hesitate to pronounce the man, who has made any\r\nconsiderable progress in this study, and who could entertain thoughts so\r\ninjurious to the honour of his Maker, to be a more wonderful being than any\r\nthat ever went before him.\r\n\r\n{xiv}The train of reflections that arise from these considerations, is\r\ngreater than is consistent with the plan I have prescribed to myself in\r\nthese pages. If the reader is desirous of being further informed of the\r\nuses and advantages of natural history, I shall refer him to\r\nStillingfleet's Tracts, taken from the Amoenitates Academicæ, published at\r\nUpsal; where he may be acquainted with many curious and interesting\r\nparticulars, which I have not room to insert here; my speculations having\r\nbeen confined to one single branch (insects) I shall only mention such\r\nobservations relative thereto as may be proper for an introduction of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nInsects may, with great truth, be considered as a rank of beings so\r\nwonderful and extraordinary, as to strike with astonishment every observer,\r\nif we regard either their structure, powers, or use; and creatures, who, at\r\nthe same time that they challenge our regard, loudly proclaim the wisdom,\r\ngoodness, and omnipotence of their great Creator. If their shape and beauty\r\nare capable of attracting our notice, their ways of living are no less\r\nadapted for exciting our admiration; and the more we enquire into their\r\nnature and history, the more occasion we shall find for confessing this\r\ngreat truth, \"nothing is created in vain.\" The wondrous manner in which\r\nnumbers of them pass their lives, during their first states, is unknown to\r\nthe greater part of mankind. Most people, indeed, know that a Caterpillar\r\nproduces a Butterfly; but thousands of persons do not know that a\r\nCaterpillar is a Butterfly in disguise, as Dr. Lister ingeniously\r\nobserves,[7] and as Swammerdam[8] proved to the great Duke of Tuscany, by\r\nstripping off the external skins, and displaying the butterfly concealed\r\nbeneath them. Many persons are ignorant that plants (even of the most\r\npoisonous nature) are the beloved and favourite food of some species of\r\ninsects, and that what is wholesome and nourishing to one, is pernicious\r\nand destructive to another. Who would believe that the hard substance of\r\nthe soundest Oak was capable of being macerated by an insect, and received\r\ninto its stomach as food? that it should there yield a proper nutriment for\r\nits growth, and that nothing but a substance as hard and firm as that could\r\npossibly contribute to the creature's health and increase? Who would\r\nimagine that a colony of Ants, an insect so contemptible in size,\r\nconsidered singly, were capable of making animals, of considerable bulk and\r\nstrength, retreat from them as from a formidable enemy?[9] Who would\r\nsuspect that numbers of insects are appointed to live, during the greatest\r\npart of their lives, within the bodies of other animals, many of whom\r\nreceive no material injury thereby; some become frantic and {xv}diseased,\r\nand others are doomed to perish, and by their deaths give birth to these\r\ntheir inbred enemies? Who, that is a stranger to natural history, would\r\nbelieve that there are insects destined to live in the waters many months,\r\nwhere their principal employment is the destruction of animals less than\r\nthemselves, on whom they feed and thrive, till they become inhabitants of\r\nthe air, when their lives are terminated in a few weeks, perishing by the\r\ndepredations of old age, if they are lucky enough to escape the power of\r\nother animals stronger than themselves? Yet such are the truths existing in\r\nnature; truths known to every one conversant with this study. In short,\r\nthere is no part of the kingdom of nature, where so many wonders are\r\nunfolded to us, as in this of insects.\r\n\r\nNor are they to be considered in that contemptible light in which the\r\ngenerality of mankind are apt to place them. We are too prone to think\r\nevery thing noxious and unnecessary, if we are not fully acquainted with\r\nits use. \"The poor Beetle that we tread on,\" serves to fill up an order of\r\nbeings, as useful and proper in the economy of nature, as that of a\r\npartridge or a hare, whose preservation and increase we are so solicitous\r\nfor. Many others, whose very sight create the most disagreeable sensations,\r\nare not less useful and proper, under the same predicament. The carcases of\r\ndead animals, which, when putrid, send forth a most nauseous stench, would\r\nremain so for a great length of time, were it not for the various kinds of\r\nFlesh Flies, who, by depositing their eggs there, help to consume it very\r\nquickly, and prevent a continuance so offensive to our nostrils and health.\r\nMany kinds of insects are to be found here in England, in great plenty,\r\nwho, it is highly probable, by a close enquiry into their natures might be\r\nrendered very serviceable to us, either mediately or immediately. The blue\r\nDung Beetle (Scarabæus Stercorarius of Linnæus) found in great plenty in\r\nJuly, under horse-dung and cow-dung, it is not unlikely may yield effects,\r\neither in medicine or dyeing, that at present we are ignorant of. It is\r\ncertain, it abounds with salts that are strong and pungent; but the\r\nexamination of them must be left to time, and the enquiry of some ingenious\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThe Meloe Proscarebeus of Linnæus, or English Oil Beetle, described by\r\nMoffat, lib. i. cap. 23., also by Godartius in Lister's translation, number\r\n120. yields an oil by expression in considerable quantity, which is used in\r\nSweden, with the greatest success, in the cure of the rheumatism, by\r\nbathing the afflicted part. Of this I have been well assured by an\r\ningenious physician who resided there. Might not the same effects be\r\nexpected from it here as there? Its virtues, I imagine, are not confined to\r\na single country; nor can I suppose the different situations of them will\r\nprevent its being equally efficacious here as in Sweden. However, it is\r\ncertainly worth while to make the experiment.[10]\r\n\r\n{xvi}The Cantharides or Spanish Flies, is a species of insect every one has\r\nheard of. They are brought us from abroad, and used medicinally; but\r\nprincipally to raise blisters. For these we pay great sums of money to\r\nforeign countries: but a proper examination into the nature of insects\r\nmight save us the necessity of doing so; for let me not be disbelieved,\r\nwhen I say this very species of the cantharides is found in England.[11]\r\nMight not, therefore, a close inquiry into the subject, spare us the\r\ntrouble and expense of applying to foreigners for this article? But are the\r\nmedicinal virtues of the cantharides confined entirely to that species? Is\r\nthere none other found in England, answering the same purpose, which we\r\nmight have by seeking for? If I am not mis-informed, there is. The Musk\r\nBeetle, or Cerambix Moschata of Linnæus, is found on the bodies of\r\nwillow-trees in the month of July, or sooner, if the weather is favourable.\r\nThis insect, I have been confidently informed by an eminent surgeon (the\r\nlate Mr. Guy) who tried it, has the same virtues, and produces the same\r\neffects as the cantharides; being capable, when properly prepared, of\r\nprocuring a strong blister in as short a space of time as the other.\r\nWhether there is not other insects to be found in this kingdom, whose\r\nproperties, when examined, might be found similar to the cantharides, is a\r\nmatter that time only will clear up.\r\n\r\nI cannot here pass unmentioned the effects of ants, whose volatile\r\neffluvia, arising from their colonies or nests is so great, that a hand\r\nrubbed thereon, and applied immediately to the nose of a fainting person,\r\nexhilarates and refreshes equal to the spirit of hartshorn, or what is\r\ncalled sal volatile.\r\n\r\nSuch are the known medicinal uses of insects; and under the article of\r\nclothing they serve us in a more conspicuous manner. To many thousands of\r\npersons they afford the means of living with comfort and happiness. Even\r\nkings are indebted to them for their grandest garments. Immense fortunes\r\nhave been procured, by their means, to persons in trade, and the great\r\nnumber of people who daily subsist by manufacturing silk, either by\r\nspinning, weaving, or dyeing it, have the greatest reason to thank\r\nProvidence for the institution of this insect. To the last, the Cochineal\r\n(Coccinella Cacti of Linnæus) affords him the power of giving our silks and\r\ncloths the most beautiful and lasting colours; being without it unable to\r\nproduce such proofs of his ingenuity; not to mention many other occasions\r\nwherein this insect is peculiarly serviceable. Nor is there any part of the\r\nworld where they do not directly, or secondarily, serve mankind for food.\r\nIn every kingdom of the earth, where they are to be found, shrimps, prawns\r\nand crabs are eaten by all ranks and degrees of people, if animal food is\r\nallowed them; and our cray-fish or lobsters must not {xvii}be excluded from\r\nthe same order. The Locust represented in Plate 50. Fig. 2. is eaten by\r\nmany tribes, and, I may say, nations of people, in Asia and Africa. These\r\nanimals are frequently driven from their native soils, by strong winds,\r\ninto foreign countries, where, for several days together, by their\r\ninconceivable numbers, they obscure the light of the sun, and make the\r\ninhabitants tremble for their vegetables. It is at those times the Asiatics\r\nand Africans gather them, and eat them with much delight, dressing them,\r\neither by stewing, or frying them with oil; they also pickle and sell them\r\npublicly in some of the markets of the Levant, and many other parts.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar belonging to Fig. 1. of Plate 38. which I have mentioned in\r\nmy description of that insect to be eaten in the West Indies, and\r\nconsidered as a dainty, is sought for by those persons who are admirers of\r\nthat food, in the most diligent manner; and I have been informed, by\r\ngentlemen of undoubted veracity, that so exceedingly delighted are they\r\nwith it, as to employ negroes on no other business but to go into the woods\r\non purpose to procure these caterpillars, by digging them out of the bodies\r\nof certain trees, the only places where they are to be found. Perhaps the\r\ncossi of the Romans, a kind of food we are told they were much delighted\r\nwith, might be a species not much unlike this; however that be, these are\r\nconsidered as amply recompensing, by their delicious flavour, the pains\r\ntaken to procure them.\r\n\r\nHoney is a substance known to every one, and the agreeable liquor made from\r\nit, which in some countries serves the inhabitants for their constant\r\ndrink, is not to be procured but by the industry of the agile bee.\r\n\r\nIn fine, the limits of this preface will not permit me to dwell minutely,\r\nand point out the benefits mankind does, and may receive, by the\r\ninstitution of this order of animals. I shall again refer my reader to the\r\nbook I mentioned before, \"Stillingfleet's Tracts;\" where he will find these\r\nand many other advantages I have not mentioned, treated of in a most\r\ningenious manner; being the observations of some of the greatest men of the\r\nuniversity of Upsal in Sweden; for this reason, therefore, I shall consider\r\nthis subject no farther, but proceed to describe the plan of the work;\r\nwherein, if the reader expects to find the insects classed in systematic\r\norder, as well as represented, he will be greatly disappointed. It is not\r\nmy present design to enter into the scientific part of the study, by\r\narranging the insects according to any system now established; nor will the\r\nreader find that I have given a single name to any one here figured. This,\r\nindeed, must be the consequence of not following the system of any author,\r\nunless I had formed one of my own; for it is impossible I should give names\r\nto them, particularly trivial ones, without doing one or the other. The\r\ncalling an insect by the general appellation of moth, butterfly, &c. I\r\ncannot consider as derogatory to what I have said. Hence I flatter myself I\r\nshall avoid all occasion for reflection by the disciples of different\r\nauthors, in not following the method established by others; and, therefore,\r\nmy desire of giving no room for exceptions of this kind, has induced me to\r\nfollow no one whatever. By this, also, I have left it in the power of every\r\nperson to {xviii}class them according to his own fancy; and, as every one\r\nhas thus an opportunity of following his favourite author, none, I hope,\r\nwill object to a method, that will put it in his power of indulging his own\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nI must here inform my readers, that this work can by no means be considered\r\nas a complete one. The most transitory view will confirm this. Nor can I\r\ntake any merit to myself by its publication, unless the great care that has\r\nbeen taken to give just and accurate figures of the subjects, in which the\r\ndifferent generical characters, according to the several authors I am\r\nacquainted with, are truly represented, will entitle me to any.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the many opportunities I have had of observing the great tendency\r\nall kinds of insects have to perish and decay, particularly moths and\r\nbutterflies, first gave me the hint of preserving them from oblivion, by\r\nthus delineating them on paper. For these last are of such tender and\r\ndelicate natures, that however pleasing and agreeable they may be to our\r\nsight, they are not easily to be preserved with all their gay and striking\r\nplumage. Our utmost care can only secure them to us a few years; and if\r\nthey are exposed to air or sunshine, we are quickly robbed of them; the\r\nlatter being capable, in a few months, of entirely destroying their\r\ncolours, and the first in as short a space, will totally consume every part\r\nof them, leaving nothing behind but a little dust.\r\n\r\nHence it is, I have been induced to give figures of foreign insects. In\r\nprosecuting which, the reader will find many that have never been described\r\nby any author; and if the rescuing them by this method from the ravages of\r\ntime, if the delight and amusement arising from contemplating subjects of\r\nthis kind, or if an attempt to promote and encourage this branch of natural\r\nhistory meets with the encouragement I hope for, I must assure the public,\r\nno labour on my side shall be wanting to render it complete, by adding\r\nfuture volumes, as the subjects I should receive from abroad, and my own\r\nleisure, will enable me to do; and this, I flatter myself, I shall be able\r\nto accomplish by the means of a few ingenious gentlemen situated in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, whose correspondence I am honoured with, and\r\nby whose assistance I shall be able to give sometimes a tolerable history\r\nof an insect, or as much of it as has fallen within their observation; by\r\nwhich means, new subjects of speculation, some unnoticed circumstances in\r\ninsect life, may arise, that cannot fail of being an acceptable\r\nembellishment. But I must observe, such pieces of information cannot be\r\nexpected to be numerous; for the difficulty of procuring the natural\r\nhistory of foreign insects is so exceedingly great, that it is better\r\nconceived than described. Few persons, who visit foreign countries, have\r\ncuriosity sufficient to prompt them to make such observations, or indeed\r\nany enquiry, into the works of nature. The desire of acquiring wealth, by\r\nthe means of trade, is the grand motive that induces them to leave their\r\nnative country; observations in natural history being generally quite\r\nforeign to their thoughts; the desire of extending their commerce, and\r\nmaking their fortunes, taking entire possession of their minds, and\r\nswallowing up every other consideration. Thus, we see, it is not from such\r\npersons we must expect any improvements tending to promote this study; it\r\nis {xix}only from men of a liberal and ingenious turn of mind, settled\r\nthere, that we can hope to have any information of the state of nature in\r\ndistant regions; and the scarcity of such men I have found to be exceeding\r\ngreat. For these reasons the reader must not expect to find the caterpillar\r\nand chrysalis of every insect represented. It is sufficient if I am able to\r\ngive figures of many exotics that have hitherto been unknown. The natural\r\nhistory, the forms of the caterpillars, ways of life, haunts, &c. can, in\r\nsuch cases, be known only to persons living on the spot, and who have\r\nspeculation enough to observe them. Whenever I receive such pieces of\r\ninformation, they shall, certainly, not be withheld from the public.\r\n\r\nWhen I first engaged in the business of describing the different insects\r\nthat compose the following work, I found myself surrounded with\r\ndifficulties of so unexpected a nature, that I had more than once\r\nentertained thoughts of postponing, if not totally relinquishing so arduous\r\na task. Nothing but the strong desire I had of promoting the study of\r\nnatural history, could have led me to overcome a sense of my own incapacity\r\nof writing with that precision, which the public eye demands; and,\r\ntherefore, I have reason to hope for the candid allowance of the ingenious,\r\nto faults, which might, perhaps, escape from the pen of a _master_, on a\r\nsubject so new as the present. Among the rest, I laboured under no little\r\ntrouble from a want of knowing what names to give to many colours found on\r\nthe wings of some of the farinaceous tribe. The want of a _series_, or\r\nstandard for names to colours, is a matter much to be lamented in this\r\nkingdom. I know no English author that has attempted it; perhaps the\r\narduousness of the task may be the reason it has not been done; for if we\r\nform to ourselves an idea of the difficulty of bringing forth that\r\ninnumerable train of colours that is to be done from only a yellow, a red\r\nand a blue, we may partly judge of the labour that man has to undergo who\r\nshall attempt it. In my case, the great variety of tints to be found on the\r\ninsects, the harshness of some, the softness of others, together with the\r\nmanner of their running into one another, increases the difficulty, and\r\nrenders descriptions a matter of such labour, that nothing but the\r\nstrongest resolution and perseverance could overcome. From hence, I hope,\r\nif the reader should chance to meet with any part among them, that does not\r\nentirely correspond with the colour given to the print, he will impute it\r\nto its proper cause, the painter. I know of no defects of this kind; but it\r\nis not impossible some may have escaped my observation, among such a\r\nmultitude of figures which I had to correct. It is necessary I should\r\ninform the reader, that all my descriptions have been taken from the\r\n_natural subjects_ themselves, and not from the _coloured prints_ of them;\r\nand that my intention therein, is not to give a perfect idea of the\r\ninsects, without the help of the figures, but only to assist the\r\nimagination in knowing what is described. And when we consider the\r\nadvantages that good engravings have over verbal descriptions, the former\r\nrepresenting to the mind, at first view, the object designed to be\r\nunderstood, without putting us to the trouble of calling all our ideas, all\r\nour powers of conception to our assistance, in order to discover what is\r\nintended to be described; {xx}while the latter, though given by the best\r\nwriters, often puzzles and confounds the mind, if our ideas do not keep\r\npace with the author's meaning, the present work, by having every coloured\r\nfigure explained, must render it superior to any hitherto published in this\r\nkingdom. The last author that published any figures of exotic subjects in\r\nnatural history, was Mr. Petiver, who, in his Gazophylacium, delineated a\r\ngreat variety of all the different _orders_; many of them exceeding curious\r\nand uncommon, being collected from various parts of the world. But they\r\nwere sent forth uncoloured, and almost undescribed; circumstances that\r\nrender them less estimable by the difficulty there is, in many instances,\r\nof knowing what the author meant; the shape of the animal, plant, &c. being\r\nthe principal, and, sometimes, the only thing, we can understand. But\r\nalthough many of the figures consist of mere outlines, not exquisitely well\r\nengraved, it is not without merit. There are a great many very uncommon\r\nsubjects exhibited, that were not known to exist in nature, till he held\r\nthem forth to public view. It is, in short, a work, that, at the same time\r\nit manifested his desire for promoting his favourite study, was a proof of\r\nhis assiduity, affording great room for speculation; and as the present is\r\nan improvement on his plan, I flatter myself it will not be unacceptable to\r\nthe lovers of natural history. There is yet another advantage arising from\r\nthe descriptions, that is not less than what I have already mentioned. If\r\nthis work should fall into the hands of a bookseller, after my decease, the\r\npublic would not probably be pestered with copies so execrably coloured, as\r\nis generally the case with books of this sort, after the author's death;\r\nthe descriptions will be such a guide for colouring the prints, that\r\ncapital errors will not be able to find admittance: the grossness of\r\ncolouring a part yellow that should be red, or green, that ought to be\r\nblue, would immediately be detected; and the publisher, for his own sake,\r\nwould undoubtedly be careful to have the prints justly and accurately done.\r\n\r\nThe experienced naturalist will perceive, that, throughout the quotations,\r\nI have not availed myself of any of the ancient authors. I have scarcely\r\nmentioned Mouffet, Aldrovandus, and others. It is certain, the figures to\r\nbe seen in the works of most of the ancients are so bad, I dared not give\r\nany quotation from them. The incorrectness of the outlines, the\r\nirregularity and impropriety of the spots and marks, together with the\r\nlooseness of the engravings, renders them too imperfect for any one to\r\nventure mentioning them. Indeed they are, in general, so little expressive\r\nof the insect intended to be represented, that no dependance can be had on\r\ntheir figures, especially the farinaceous winged tribe. Clerck, Merian,\r\nRoesel, Petiver, &c. are the authors I have principally mentioned, among\r\nthe iconographers; and if the insect has been figured by a great many\r\nauthors, as particularly Plate 34. Fig. 7, 8. I have only mentioned a few:\r\nthe rest may be known by looking into the Systema of Linnæus[12], under the\r\ntitle mentioned in the quotation. This author is the principal one I have\r\nquoted among the descriptive writers: his great judgment in this study, the\r\nplain method he has laid down for the classing of insects, together with\r\nthe {xxi}excellency of his generical characters, are what must endear him\r\nto every professor of this study. I speak only of that part relating to the\r\ninsect kingdom; the merits of the other parts are best known to those\r\nconversant in the respective branches. I must not here pass over a\r\ncircumstance, which it is proper to apprize my readers of, by way of\r\napology for giving a few figures (but a few) that have been published\r\nalready in this kingdom. When I first laid down the plan of this work, I\r\nhad no intention of confining myself to those subjects that were\r\nnon-descripts; but proposed to give figures of any exotic insects that\r\nmight fall into my possession, or what I could procure drawings of, by the\r\nassistance of those gentlemen who were friends to an attempt of this sort.\r\nI was willing to promote this branch of natural history, by any method that\r\nlay within the compass of my little sphere. This I was the rather prompted\r\nto, by the consideration of its being an attempt entirely novel in this\r\nnation, and conducted in a way different from any yet pursued. But a little\r\nrecollection convinced me I was wrong. I was soon sensible, that the giving\r\nfigures, already known and published here, could do no service to the\r\nstudy, or benefit the reader; it is possible I might give a better figure\r\nthan that before published; the engraving might be softer, more delicate,\r\nand better becoming the subject; or the colouring more exact and just: but\r\nthis would not be improving the reader's judgment, or increasing his\r\nknowledge. In short, from that moment I altered my plan; and it is to this\r\nmistake a few figures are inserted in different places, which have before\r\nmade their appearance in England, either separately, or mixed with other\r\nsubjects of natural history. From that time I took care to delineate none\r\nthat I was conscious had engaged the pencil of any preceding author; but\r\nconfined myself to such, whose novelty and striking appearances could not\r\nfail to recommend them. To such non-descripts I have paid the greatest\r\ndeference; for in some of the plates, among the butterflies and moths, I\r\nhave given complete figures of both the upper and under sides; a practice\r\nthat, as deviating from my general rule, I should not have done, if the\r\nrichness and softness of the colouring had not been so extremely pleasing,\r\nas to render it scarcely possible to dispense with it. It is only to a few\r\nI have paid this particular respect. In general, I have given to the\r\nbutterflies, only figures of one half their under sides, but whole upper\r\nones; and of those moths that have no representations of their under sides,\r\nthe reader may conclude there is no material difference between their upper\r\nand under ones, or else the latter is too poor and mean to justify the\r\ngiving a figure of it. I must just mention, that although I used this\r\nforbearance to those figures that had been heretofore published, I by no\r\nmeans meant to debar myself from representing such as had been only\r\n_verbally_ described; as is the case with a great many to be met with in\r\nthe Systema of Linnæus, and in other authors. The refraining, therefore,\r\nfrom such subjects, would have been rather condemnable than fit to be\r\napproved, for the reasons I mentioned before, of the great difficulty there\r\nis in understanding, sometimes, the best verbal descriptions that ever were\r\ngiven; therefore figures of this kind may not improperly be considered as\r\nexplanatory, or as illustrations to {xxii}such verbal descriptions,\r\naffording the student a two-fold pleasure, by comparing them together.\r\n\r\nIf the reader has made no progress in the study of natural history, he will\r\nprobably find it difficult to understand the several _names_, or _terms_,\r\nthe different parts of insects are called by; and which occur in every\r\ndescription. For this reason I think it incumbent on me to give the most\r\nplain and familiar explanation of them I possibly can. This I have done two\r\nways; by methodical definitions, and figures; and in both of them shall\r\nmake no scruple to follow the method laid down by that great master of\r\nnatural history, the judicious Linnæus, whose excellent plan, for the\r\nknowledge and classing of insects, demands the utmost thanks and regard\r\nfrom every lover of this branch of science. From his plan I have taken the\r\nhint of giving some figures of different genera, with the proper names of\r\nthe respective parts in a plate by themselves. By these the reader will not\r\nonly be greatly assisted in understanding the descriptions; but it will\r\nenable him to class them with more facility, if he is inclined to do so. I\r\ntherefore go on to explain, first the _terms_ used throughout the whole;\r\nand afterwards the distinct and different _parts_ of insects. In doing\r\nthis, I divide them into\r\n\r\nORDER, CLASS, GENUS, and SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  _Order_, is a general term, applicable to a whole race of animals,\r\n  whereby they are distinguished from each other, as beasts, birds, fishes,\r\n  &c.[13]\r\n\r\n  _Class_, a term by which insects, as well as other animals, are divided\r\n  into their respective genera or tribes, as the farinaceous, crustaceous,\r\n  transparent, &c.[14]\r\n\r\n  _Genus_, a term dividing each class, as butterfly, moth, hawk-moth,\r\n  constitute the farinaceous (Lepidoptera); dung-beetle, lady-bird,\r\n  goat-chaffer, and many others, make up the crustaceous (Coleoptera);\r\n  cockroach, locust, bug, and some others, form the semi-crustaceous\r\n  (Hemiptera, Linn.), &c.[15]\r\n\r\n  _Species_, a term comprehending a distinct or individual sort in each\r\n  genus, as the pearl-bordered, admirable, skipper, &c. among the\r\n  butterflies; egger, drinker, peppered, &c. among moths, &c.\r\n\r\nTo these I must add the word\r\n\r\n  _Variety_, a term by which two insects of the same species are known,\r\n  though differing a little (not characteristically) in colour, size,\r\n  &c.[16]\r\n\r\n{xxiii}I shall next proceed to explain and describe the different parts\r\ncomposing insects, by dividing them into the Head, Thorax, Abdomen, and\r\nLimbs.[17]\r\n\r\nThe HEAD (Fig. 1, 2, 3, _a_.) includes the ANTENNÆ, MOUTH, PALPI, EYES,\r\nTONGUE, JAWS, and HORNS.\r\n\r\n  The _Antennæ_ are formed of various shapes, according to the different\r\n  genera, as may be observed in the figures, and seem instituted by nature\r\n  not only for guiding the animal in its passage, but likewise for other\r\n  purposes; being endued with an exquisite sense of feeling and perception.\r\n  Fig. 1. _d d_. Fig. 2. _c_. Fig. 3. _c c_.\r\n\r\n  The _Mouth_ is placed in the head, but sometimes close to the breast, as\r\n  in the spider tribe; sometimes terminating in a horny beak, as in Plate\r\n  32. Fig. 1. also in Plate 42. Fig. 3 and 7. In some it is furnished with\r\n  strong mandibles like pincers, as in Plate 32. Fig. 6. and Plate 37. Fig.\r\n  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. In others it is so covered and guarded by the palpi,\r\n  particularly among the moths, that it is not to be seen.\r\n\r\n  The _Palpi_ are parts placed close to the mouth, and variously shaped; as\r\n  may be seen by comparing those of the Lepidopterous with those of the\r\n  Coleopterous, and other tribes; consisting of a greater or less number\r\n  according to the species or genus; in some being only two, in most of\r\n  them four, and in some six, (Cicindela, Carabus, Linn.) The use and\r\n  purpose of these parts we are ignorant of. Fig. 1. _c c_. Fig. 2. _b_.\r\n  Fig. 3. _b b_.\r\n\r\n  The _Eyes_ are generally immoveable, and suited differently; in some to\r\n  see only in the night, in others in the day; and differ in number\r\n  according to the genera and species, having in general two only, but in\r\n  some five,[18] in others eight, as the spiders. Fig. 1. _b b_. Fig. 3. _d\r\n  d_.\r\n\r\n  The _Tongue_ (elongated maxillæ) is sometimes curled up spirally like the\r\n  spring of a watch, as in butterflies and some moths, &c. in others it\r\n  (including the labium) is doubled under the head, as in bees and wasps;\r\n  but a great many species are destitute of this elongated part.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe THORAX is principally composed of the BACK, BREAST, and in some the\r\nSCUTELLUM, in others the MESOSTERNUM and DILATED POSTERIOR COXÆ.\r\n\r\n  The _Back_, dorsum or upper part, answering to the back in some animals,\r\n  terminates in some species in a triangular manner, so as to represent the\r\n  scutellum, as in Plate 33. Fig. 5, 6, and 8. Tab. Ann. Fig. 1. _f_. Fig.\r\n  2. _e_.\r\n\r\n  The _Breast_, or sternum, is the under part of the thorax, and always\r\n  furnished with legs.\r\n\r\n  The _Scutellum_ is a small but hard part like a scale, frequently of a\r\n  triangular shape, placed behind the dorsum of the prothorax, and joining\r\n  to it. It is not developed in every genus, being chiefly perceived in the\r\n  Coleopterous, Hemipterous, and transparent-winged orders.\r\n\r\n  The _Mesosternum_ is united to the fore part of the breast, extending\r\n  beyond the middle legs towards the fore ones; and observable only in some\r\n  species of the Coleopterous order. By Linnæus and several other authors\r\n  it is called sternum.\r\n\r\n  {xxiv}The _Posterior Coxæ_ are only conspicuously enlarged in some\r\n  particular species (dung beetles). There are two of them placed on the\r\n  sides of the breast next to the abdomen, under the hinder thighs. In some\r\n  they are placed remote and distinct from it, in others they lie close;\r\n  being moveable in some, in others they are fixed. The use of these parts\r\n  we are ignorant of.[19]\r\n\r\n  The _Abdomen_ consists of a number of annuli or rings, and contains the\r\n  greatest part of the intestines and other viscera; being united to the\r\n  trunk, and formed with holes on the sides, through which the insect\r\n  breathes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe LIMBS comprehend the TAIL, LEGS, and WINGS, with their cases.\r\n\r\n  The _Tail_ is placed at the extremity of the abdomen; and in some is\r\n  furnished with a sting, in others it is armed with a pair of forceps;\r\n  sometimes with a single bristle, sometimes with a double one; in some\r\n  with a pair of claws like a crab, in others like a fork.\r\n\r\n  The _Legs_ include the coxæ, trochanters, femora, tibiæ, and tarsi; the\r\n  latter consisting of two, sometimes of three, four, or five\r\n  articulations. In some the fore ones resemble a crab's claws. Some are\r\n  furnished with spines, others are smooth and plain. The hinder ones are\r\n  formed for running, leaping, or swimming.\r\n\r\n  The _Wings_, being always two or four, are either plain or folded, erect\r\n  or open, lying flat or inclining downwards, &c. In some they are dentated\r\n  or scolloped; and some are furnished with two projections like tails.\r\n  They are also membranaceous, reticulated, or transparent, and frequently\r\n  adorned with beautiful colours. In some they are curiously folded within\r\n  two crustaceous cases, that are either smooth or rough, striated,\r\n  furrowed, punctated, &c. in some these cases are soft and flexile, in\r\n  others hard like horn; the Hemipterous are partly soft and transparent,\r\n  as in Plate 49. Fig. 2. and partly opake and hard, as in Plate 42. Fig.\r\n  1. Plate 43. Fig. 2. and Plate 45. Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to observe, that I have not been so prolix and explanatory\r\nin the foregoing definitions as I should be, if I intended to arrange the\r\nfigures under their respective classes, or establish any system for doing\r\nso; I have explained no more _terms_ or _parts_ than what are sufficient to\r\nenable the reader (if he is not an adept) easily and clearly to understand\r\nthe descriptions. It is likewise necessary to mention, that I have given\r\nEnglish names to most of the parts, where I could do it with the necessary\r\npropriety for serving this particular purpose; and where I could not\r\nsubstitute an English word, that was apposite and significant, I have\r\npreserved the Latin one, as used by Linnæus and others. Thus, for instance,\r\nthe term palpi I would have altered, if I could have found an English word\r\nthat conveyed the same idea; but not easily finding one, I have kept to the\r\noriginal. I have not forgot the terms mustachios, whiskers, &c. which I\r\nmight have used in its stead; but as these parts in many insects bore no\r\nanalogy or resemblance thereto, it being in a great many of them like a\r\nshort jointed filament or thread, I rather chose to preserve the Latin one.\r\nThe same practice I have observed with the term antennæ. For though feelers\r\nis the general explanation given to this word, I could not prevail with\r\nmyself to use it. The reason is, because these animals seem to have a power\r\n{xxv}of applying these parts to purposes different from that of feeling. By\r\nthe antennæ they are capable of distinguishing and perceiving, as well as\r\nfeeling; and I am strongly inclined to believe, it is by them the males are\r\ncapable of discovering the females at a great distance. It is certain their\r\npowers of perception are very obvious and remarkable, which, by close\r\nobservations, we may soon discover; and unless we allow them capable of\r\nsmelling without nostrils, I do not know what parts they exercise, or by\r\nwhat means they so readily discover, not only their females but their\r\nrespective kinds of food, the places proper for depositing their eggs, &c.\r\nThe male moths appear to have this faculty of discovering their females in\r\na greater degree than most other insects; for there are but a very few, if\r\nany, belonging to this genus, whose females pass the first night after they\r\nquit the chrysalis without coupling with the males; owing to unconquerable\r\n_desire_ in the latter, and the strong effluvia or scent emitted by the\r\nformer for attracting their mates. Every adept is fully acquainted that a\r\nfemale moth, known by the name of the Egger (Phalæna Quercus of Linnæus),\r\ntaken into the fields the first day it is hatched, will most certainly\r\n(though shut up in a box) allure all the males round the country that are\r\nwithin the sphere of its attraction, and even from a great distance; who\r\nwill at first fly round the box with wonderful swiftness and eagerness, and\r\nafterwards settling thereon will hunt and run about it with the greatest\r\nimpatience, endeavouring to get at the inclosed female; and all this from\r\nthe strongest desire of copulation; for the minute that action is performed\r\nby a male, the attractive property of the other ceases. The powers of\r\nperception and distinction, therefore, are very great; and what parts of\r\nthe insects, unless it be the antennæ, are employed in this search I am at\r\na loss to discover. However, at present, I presume it will not be necessary\r\nto offer any further reasons for using this term, as the name substituted\r\nis sufficient for it to be known by, it will fully answer the intended\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe names of the other parts are too intelligible to require any\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe plate annexed (being the last thing I shall speak of) requires but\r\nlittle to be said in its favour. The use and advantage of it is too obvious\r\nto dwell on. I have already mentioned, that engravings and delineations\r\nclaim the preference in the highest degree of verbal descriptions; and as\r\nsuch, I presume, the reader will find this plate of the greatest service in\r\nassisting him to understand the descriptive parts with clearness and ease.\r\nI must only recommend it to him, if he is desirous of avoiding difficulty\r\nand trouble, to make himself fully acquainted with the terms and names of\r\nall the parts of insects, before he begins to read the descriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Explanation of Fig. I.\r\n\r\n  _a_  The head.\r\n\r\n  _b b_  The eyes.\r\n\r\n  _c c_  The palpi.\r\n\r\n  _d d_  The antennæ.\r\n\r\n  _e e_  The shoulders. The patagia, or tippets, are placed here.\r\n\r\n  _f_  The thorax.

(_larva and pupa._)\r\n\r\n  HABITAT: Barbary, Asia Minor, and the Northern Coast of the Mediterranean\r\n  Sea.\r\n\r\n  _Upper Side._ The anterior wings are of a fine chocolate, with an\r\n  orange-coloured margin running along the exterior edge, within which are\r\n  some faint round orange spots; those next the anterior edge, where they\r\n  begin, being strongest. The posterior wings are furnished with four tails\r\n  (the outer ones being the shortest) and are of a blue black. A yellow\r\n  scolloped margin runs round their external edges, verged with black;\r\n  above which are some lunate spots of a sky blue.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The anterior wings, next the body, are of a faint dark red,\r\n  with many spots and marks of a dirty olive, differently shaped, margined\r\n  with white. An orange margin runs along the exterior edge, intersected by\r\n  the blue tendons; and above it are several triangular marks of a faint\r\n  orange, on a blueish hazel ground, which deadens as it approaches the\r\n  margin. The posterior wings have on each a white band, running\r\n  transversely, and meeting just below the extremity of the body; within\r\n  which, and including the anal groove, are many round, oval, and other\r\n  shaped marks of chocolate and dark olive; verged with white. A scolloped\r\n  margin, of a deep lemon colour, runs along the posterior edges, verged\r\n  with dirty green, and separated from the white band by a bar of hazel\r\n  colour, and some large brown reddish spots and marks. Two blue spots are\r\n  placed just above the two longest tails, with several lesser ones, just\r\n  above the lemon-coloured margin.\r\n\r\nI have thought it more in accordance with the principles which are now\r\nalmost universally adopted, in regulating specific nomenclature, to revert\r\nto the original Linnæan {2}name of Jason in preference to that of\r\nFabricius. This butterfly may be regarded as one of the most splendid of\r\nthe Lepidoptera of Europe, to the southern portion of which and to the\r\nnorthern shores of Africa it appears to be confined. The strength of its\r\ngeneral structure indicates great powers of flight, and we accordingly find\r\nthat it is able to sustain itself in the air with very little motion of the\r\nwings. The female differs from the male only by having the centre of the\r\nposterior wings adorned with small blue spots on the upper side. There are\r\ntwo broods in the year, namely in June and September, and, according to M.\r\nDe Villiers, the insect emits a strong scent of musk. The caterpillar is\r\nnaked and thickened in the middle of the body; the tail tapering into two\r\nshort points, the head is also armed with two conical erect horns. In this\r\nrespect, therefore, this insect very nearly approaches the genus Apatura,\r\nof which the purple Emperor, Ap. Iris is the type, thus proving the\r\nadvantages to be obtained, in studying the natural relations of this\r\ndifficult order of Annulosa, from an accurate acquaintance with the\r\nstructure and habits of the early stages of the insect.\r\n\r\nThere are several species, having the same general form as the Jason,\r\nincluding Athamas, pl. 2. fig. 3. 4; Eudoxus, vol. iii. pl. 33. f. 1. 4;\r\nCamulus, vol. iii. pl. 30. f. 1. 2. Mr. Swainson has, accordingly, formed\r\nthem into a distinct group, to which he has given the name of Jasia, in\r\npursuance with his customary, but scarcely correct plan, of raising the\r\nspecific name of the typical species into a generic name, and then giving a\r\nnew specific name to such type. M. Boisduval, rejecting this system of\r\nnomenclature, has more recently proposed for the same group the name of\r\nCharaxes, which I have adopted.\r\n\r\nAmongst the species very nearly resembling Jason, is one sent from\r\nAfrica[20] to Mr. Drury by Mr. Smeathman, which, according to the\r\nobservations of that traveller, published by Drury, in the introduction to\r\nhis third volume, flies in the heat of the day with amazing rapidity, and\r\nseldom descends within eight feet of the ground. It glances from the\r\nprominent branches of one tree to those of another, as swift as a swallow,\r\nand turns its head about instantly to the glade, or path, and will not\r\nsuffer any person to approach within a striking distance of it, but darts\r\naway on the least motion of the body. If the collector exert his patience\r\nit will at last become more familiar and careless, and is then to be caught\r\nupon some particular branch, to which it will appear more attached than to\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\n{3}THECLA ACIS.\r\n\r\nPlate I. fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

The posterior wings have, on each,\r\n  near the external edge, a mark somewhat like a large eye; upon whose\r\n  under edge are two semi-eyes, one black, the other the same colour as the\r\n  wings. Many agreeable shades, of a lighter colour, and ingrailed lines,\r\n  run across all the wings.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The head, breast, and legs, are the same colour as the\r\n  upper side; except the thighs of the fore legs, which are red. There is\r\n  very little variety of colours on this side, except a purplish hue,\r\n  visible when held in a declining direction.\r\n\r\nDrury notices another insect, also received by him from Saint\r\nChristopher's, of smaller size, and differing only in having a narrow\r\nindented bar, of a flesh colour, crossing the upper and lower wings, and\r\nwhich, he thinks, may possibly be the other sex of the insect here figured;\r\nconsidering also, that the references to Linnæus and Sloane, apply rather\r\nto the smaller insect. Fabricius states, that the female of Odora is\r\ndistinguished by having a fascia, composed of three waved white lines, in\r\nthe middle of the wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n{7}SPILOSOMA ACREA.\r\n\r\nPlate III. fig. 2.

The abdomen yellow,\r\n  with black spots on the sides and top, the extremity being white. All the\r\n  wings are white, with black spots, whose number is very variable; but, on\r\n  the anterior edges of each anterior wing, are placed five, and on the\r\n  external edges, six.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side_. The legs are black and white, the thighs yellow; the\r\n  abdomen white, spotted with black. All the wings are white, with black\r\n  spots, most of which, observed on the upper side, being seen on this.\r\n\r\nThis species is closely allied to the common British species, Spilosoma\r\nlubricepida, and Menthrastri; but is of larger size, the spots being also\r\nlarger. The two figures given by Drury, are now ascertained to be the sexes\r\nof the same species, as, indeed, our author had surmised might be the case.\r\nIt appears to be a very common species, and is stated by Drury to breed\r\ntwice a year, namely, in June and September. The caterpillar is very hairy,\r\nand when young is white; as it advances in age, it acquires a fox colour,\r\nand, in its last skin, becomes almost black. Dr. Thaddeus W. Harris, a\r\ndistinguished American entomologist, to whom I am indebted for many\r\nvaluable insects of that country, has published a very interesting notice,\r\nin the work above cited, upon this insect, under the title of \"The Natural\r\nHistory of the Salt-marsh Caterpillar,\" under which name the larva of this\r\ninsect is commonly known, and which is exceedingly destructive to grasses\r\nof various kinds. He states, that when nearly full-fed, \"they become very\r\nvoracious, and continue eating all the day and night without intermission.\r\nSoon they leave the meadows, aggregated in great numbers, and commence the\r\nwandering state, or begin to run, as is the phrase, devouring everything in\r\ntheir progress; corn-fields, gardens, and even the coarse and rank\r\n{8}produce of road sides, afford them temporary nourishment, until they\r\nhave found a place of security from the wind and weather.\" Dr. Harris, in a\r\ncommunication to me, has stated, that he had ascertained that this insect\r\nwas the Acria of Fabricius, and that Professor Peck's name must, therefore,\r\nbe rejected. Abbot observes, respecting this caterpillar, that it is \"a\r\ngeneral devourer of all field and garden-plants, and weeds. It spun up in a\r\nthin web, intermixed with its own hairs, on the 16th of May, and the moth\r\ncame out on the 2d of June. Others of the autumnal brood, taken in\r\nSeptember, spun up on the 18th of that month, and remained in the chrysalis\r\nuntil the 21st of April.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCETHOSIA CYANE.\r\n\r\nPlate IV. fig. 1.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

The posterior wings, which are\r\n  deeply dentated, are white; with a deep black border running along the\r\n  external edge, whereon is a row of white angulated marks, as on the\r\n  superior wings, and above each of them is a series of short white\r\n  streaks, running parallel with the edge of the wing. Above these are six\r\n  round black spots, one situated between each nerve, and over them six\r\n  more smaller, and fainter; several more spots being dispersed on the\r\n  white parts of the wings, some very distinct, and others very faint.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The anterior wings are red, which colour extends from the\r\n  base nearly half along the wing, and which, towards the posterior edge,\r\n  softens to a cream-colour. On this red ground are some short black lines,\r\n  with blue ones between them, extending between the two principal nerves.\r\n  The external edge has a black margin; whereon the white angular marks are\r\n  seen more distinctly, being here shaped like beards of arrows. Above this\r\n  border, near the external angle, are two oval black spots, or eyes, whose\r\n  irides are white, having between them and the black border a row of\r\n  small, round, black spots, placed close together. The white bar described\r\n  on the upper side is also seen here. Several more black spots, of various\r\n  forms, are dispersed on different parts, particularly a group in the\r\n  centre of the wing. The inferior wings are white, with pale\r\n  cream-coloured clouds; but next the base are white, blue, and red, with\r\n  black streaks, from whence a shade of blue and brown runs along the\r\n  anterior edge to the external angle, where a black border commences,\r\n  whereon are angular white marks, like arrow beards or points. This border\r\n  continues to the abdominal corners, where two small, curved, black lines\r\n  meet together, and form an arch. Above the black border is a row of small\r\n  black spots, and above them are six larger, with several others, of\r\n  different shapes and sizes, dispersed on various parts of the wings.\r\n\r\n{9}The insect described in the Encyclopédie Méthodique, from Malabar,\r\ndiffers from that figured by Drury, in having the disc of the posterior\r\nwings of a fulvous buff colour, and the spots larger, with the markings at\r\nthe base of this pair of wings, on the under side fulvous instead of blue.\r\nIs this to be regarded as a variety, the opposite sex, or a distinct\r\nspecies?\r\n\r\n\r\nCETHOSIA BIBLIS.\r\n\r\nPlate IV. fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

Above this are five white squarish spots, and over them a row of\r\n  angulated marks, like points of arrows, with white spots in their\r\n  centres, above which is a single white spot, between which and the\r\n  shoulders are some short black waved lines, extending between the two\r\n  principal nerves. The posterior wings are entirely of a brown orange,\r\n  except a rusty red-brown border that runs along the external edge,\r\n  whereon is a row of white crescents, and above it are six black spots\r\n  running parallel with the border, beneath which is a denticulated line of\r\n  dark brown.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The anterior wings, next the shoulders, are of a brown\r\n  orange, reaching half way along the wings, the remainder being rusty\r\n  yellow. On the orange ground, next the shoulders, are several black,\r\n  irregular, short lines, placed two and two, the middle, or spaces between\r\n  them, being clay-coloured. Two small black spots are placed on the\r\n  anterior edge, on each side near the base. Along the external edge is a\r\n  row of white angulated lines, above which is a row of ash-coloured marks,\r\n  with some dark spots thereon; and over this, is another row of\r\n  ash-coloured marks, shaped like acute angles, with an oblong streak in\r\n  the centre of each. The posterior wings at the base are dark orange, but\r\n  toward the external edges are rusty yellow, on which is a row of\r\n  crescents on a dark border. Above this is a circular bar or band of a\r\n  flesh colour, having a row of dark spots on the lower edge, and the upper\r\n  edge shaped like acute angles, with a black triangular mark in each, and\r\n  a white spot in its centre. About a quarter of an inch above this bar is\r\n  another of a clay colour, about one-eighth of an inch broad, with dark\r\n  spots and marks on it, some of which resemble Greek characters. Over this\r\n  bar is another near the base, of a clay colour, with a double row of\r\n  black marks or streaks on it.\r\n\r\nFabricius has confounded this species and another, under the name of\r\nPenthesilea. Latreille and Godart have altered the specific name proposed\r\nby Drury to that of Biblina, \"parce qu'il a été imposé ultérieurement à un\r\ngenre de Lépidoptères diurnes.\" I have, however, restored the specific name\r\nof Biblis, because the same name, was not {10}proposed for a genus by\r\nFabricius, until many years after the publication of Drury's work, in the\r\nSynopsis of the Systema Glossatorum, published in Illiger's Magazine; and\r\nbecause the employment of a proper name, like Biblis, for a species, even\r\nwhen previously used for a genus belonging to a perfectly distinct group,\r\nis not incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCYNTHIA HUNTERA.\r\n\r\nPlate V. fig. 1.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

The posterior wings are a little\r\n  dentated, and of a brown orange colour like the anterior, having five\r\n  black spots placed near the external edge of each, two of which being\r\n  larger than the rest have blue centres, below these is a black border,\r\n  with a row of brown-orange crescents running along the middle. The cilia\r\n  is black and white.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The anterior wings at the base are greyish, beyond which\r\n  they are beautifully adorned with rose-coloured and black marks, having\r\n  three white spots on each near the external edge, with several clouds and\r\n  marks of different colours placed at the tips and anterior edges. The\r\n  posterior wings are of a beautiful agate colour, with many lines and\r\n  narrow bars branching from, and intersecting one another under different\r\n  directions (like lines in a map), so as to form spots and clouds of\r\n  different shapes. Each wing has two eyes placed near the external edge,\r\n  one larger than the other, the pupils being of a blueish hue and the\r\n  irides black, the small one having a yellow circle within it; below\r\n  these, a purple line runs parallel with, and near to the external edge.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this insect is described by Drury as being green, with\r\nblack rings round the body, and as feeding about New York upon the wild\r\nbalsams, appearing about the latter end of July, or beginning of August.\r\nOnce in about five or six years they are exceedingly plentiful, at other\r\ntimes very scarce; a peculiarity also noticed in the very nearly allied\r\nEuropean species, Cynthia Cardui (the Painted lady), of which species,\r\nindeed, Drury appears to have regarded it as a geographical variety.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar, according to Abbot, is of a brown colour, with the\r\nincisions, and a {11}lateral line yellow; it has also two dorsal lines,\r\nformed of alternately white and red points; the head is black, and the\r\nspines, with which the body is armed, are of the prevalent colour of the\r\nsurface. It feeds upon the Gnaphalum obtusifolium. The chrysalis is rather\r\nyellow, with black spots, and is assumed towards the end of April or\r\nbeginning of May. The butterfly appears at the end of about ten days. It\r\ncontinues breeding during the summer, and is very commonly seen sucking up\r\nmoisture from damp places near houses. The caterpillar folds and spins the\r\nleaves together, in the same manner as the English Painted lady, Cynthia\r\nCardui.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIERIS (THESTIAS) PYRENE?\r\n\r\nPlate V. fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

M. Boisduval has\r\nnot diminished the confusion, in his work just published, by giving a\r\nspecies from Guinea, under the name of Evippe (which Linnæus states is from\r\nChina), with the erroneous observation, \"Il est probable que les anciens\r\nauteurs auront confondu sous le nom d'Evippe trois ou quatre espèces\r\n_Africaines_.\"--_Hist.

A black scolloped border runs\r\n  along the external edges of the posterior wings, whereon are two rows of\r\n  tawny red spots, appearing like crescents, with their convex sides placed\r\n  against each other. All the wings are scolloped or dentated.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The anterior wings, toward the body, are brown orange. The\r\n  tips are of a yellowish flesh colour, with some olive spots on them, with\r\n  black spots, as on the upper side. The posterior wings are of a yellow\r\n  flesh colour, marked with some olive spots, and white marks, which seem\r\n  of a silver hue. A margin of olive colour runs along the external edges,\r\n  whereon is a row of flesh-coloured crescents (as on the upper side), with\r\n  an intersected narrow line above them. Over these, are five round olive\r\n  spots, of equal sizes, with a dot of silver in their centres.\r\n\r\nThe specific name given to this species by Drury, having the priority in\r\npoint of date, would have been retained, had it not been identical with\r\nthat of the genus to which it belongs.

Méth._).\r\n\r\n  _Upper Side._ The antennæ are about an inch long, slender, setaceous, and\r\n  gradually diminishing from the base to the extremities. The head is\r\n  small. The thorax is clothed with long soft hair, and, {14}with the\r\n  abdomen, is of a darkish brown. A remarkable straight narrow line, or\r\n  bar, of a cream colour, arises from the middle of the anterior edge of\r\n  each of the fore wings, and, crossing both anterior and posterior wings,\r\n  ends at the abdominal edges, about half an inch below the abdomen; so\r\n  that, when the wings are extended, as in the figure, these lines, with\r\n  the anterior edges, form an equilateral triangle. The space within the\r\n  triangle is dark brown; but the parts, near the shoulders, are lighter,\r\n  having a greyish cast or hue, and contain many small transverse curved\r\n  streaks, extending to the anterior edges, where they are large, black,\r\n  and very conspicuous, like stripes. Some transverse markings of this\r\n  kind, are dispersed on the posterior edges of the superior wings, and\r\n  also on the abdominal edges of the posterior. On the outside the\r\n  triangle, both on the anterior and posterior wings, is a fascia, of light\r\n  brown, about half an inch broad, which deepens into a dark brown. On the\r\n  posterior wings, after becoming dark, it softens again into the same\r\n  light colour, continuing to the external edges. Each of these wings is\r\n  ornamented with two tails, the inner ones the longest and near an inch in\r\n  length, the tips of which incline towards each other; the lesser or outer\r\n  tails, are about half an inch long, strengthened by the tendons of the\r\n  wings passing through the middle of them; all of them being bordered with\r\n  a soft ray of dark brown.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The bars or lines, which form the triangle on the upper\r\n  side, are not visible on this; but the inclosed triangular field appears\r\n  of a light greyish brown, darker at the borders, and thickly beset with\r\n  small brown streaks, parallel to each other, and surrounding the body.\r\n  The costal nerve of the anterior wings composes an edging in each, about\r\n  an eighth of an inch broad, which diminishes as it approaches the\r\n  external angle, white, and beautifully marked with black streaks, but\r\n  smaller than those seen on the upper side. Outside the triangle, both in\r\n  the anterior and posterior wings, is a broad border of white, which\r\n  softens into a brown, but lighter than that on the upper side. Both in\r\n  the white, and in the brown, are some small dashes of black, very thinly\r\n  dispersed. The internal margin of the posterior wings is furnished with a\r\n  deep fringe, and the black marks situated below the abdomen, are larger\r\n  and broader than those on the upper side. The tails are whitish, bordered\r\n  with brown, and appear as on the upper side.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those anomalous forms, whereof examples occur in every tribe\r\nof animals, baffling the skill of the most profound systematists. By\r\nLinnæus, and many other authors, it was considered as a butterfly, and\r\ncertainly the genus Urania (in which it is placed by Latreille), as we\r\nlearn from Mr. W. S. MacLeay's valuable memoir upon that genus, published\r\nin the first volume of the Transactions of the Zoological Society of\r\nLondon, is composed of day-flying species. Fabricius, however, regarded it\r\nas a moth, belonging to the genus Noctua, and nearly related to the genus\r\nErebus, of which the Erebus Odora, figured in the third plate of the\r\npresent volume, is a conspicuous species; and when we examine the structure\r\nof the palpi, and the spurs upon the posterior tibiæ, we find good reason\r\nfor adopting this relation, admitting, at the same time, that the group in\r\nquestion is one which, from its various affinities and analogies, it is\r\nvery difficult to assign to any single section.\r\n\r\n\r\n{15}CALLIMORPHA PHYLLIRA.\r\n\r\nPlate VII. fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

Behind the head are two\r\n  black spots, and on the thorax are three others, longer, and running\r\n  parallel with it. The abdomen is scarlet, and on each segment is a black\r\n  mark, forming a row, united together in the middle. All the wings are\r\n  entire. The anterior ones black, with cream-coloured cilia; the interior\r\n  edge, and part of the anterior, next the body, are margined with cream\r\n  colour. A line of the same colour, runs from the body, parallel with, and\r\n  near to the posterior edge, quite to the external one, where, suddenly\r\n  returning, in a zigzag manner, it ends at the anterior edge, near the\r\n  tips, and forms two angles, like a B, with a line placed across its top,\r\n  or upper part. The posterior wings are scarlet, having a thin border of\r\n  black, running along their external edges, with four black spots above\r\n  it, those nearest the abdomen, being in shape like hearts.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ Like the upper: but the colours are more faint and less\r\n  distinct.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this species is brown, with small dorsal and lateral\r\ndiamond-shaped yellow spots, emitting fascicles of hairs. It feeds,\r\naccording to Abbot, on the cross-wort, corn, peas, wheat, &c. One of the\r\ncaterpillars spun up on the 4th of April, and the moth appeared on the\r\n29th. Another spun up on the 27th of May, and came out on the 16th of June.\r\nIt continues breeding during most part of the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPILOSOMA NAIS.\r\n\r\nPlate VII. fig. 3.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

The\r\n  anterior wings are black; the cilia of a light yellowish brown, which\r\n  colour is continued along the interior edges, up to the body; some broad\r\n  lines, of the same colour, occupy about two-thirds of the wing, running\r\n  parallel with the anterior and interior edges.

The thorax and abdomen yellow, clouded with a light\r\n  reddish-brown colour, inclining to crimson. The anterior wings are of a\r\n  fine bright yellow, with several clouds on them of the same brown colour,\r\n  whereof one takes its rise at the tips, and runs along the external edge\r\n  to the lower corners, being narrower at the extremities than the middle,\r\n  where it branches off, and unites to a large cloud near the shoulders.\r\n  The yellow parts of all the wings appear as if sprinkled with dark\r\n  irregular specks. The posterior wings are of the same bright yellow as\r\n  the anterior, and have, in the middle of each, a small brown eye, with a\r\n  lighter spot in its centre. An irregular bar of the same reddish brown\r\n  colour crosses these wings, which, beginning at the outer angle, meets at\r\n  the anal angle. The edges of all the wings are plain.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The thorax and abdomen are yellow. All the wings are of the\r\n  same yellow colour, and sprinkled with brown as on the upper side. The\r\n  superior wings have on each a light reddish brown eye near the middle,\r\n  with a light spot in the centre, and a round brown spot above it. The\r\n  anterior margins next the body are of a reddish brown; and the same cloud\r\n  that appears along the external edge of each wing on the upper side,\r\n  appears also on this, but fainter. The inferior wings have a reddish\r\n  brown eye in each near the middle, with a lighter spot in the centre, and\r\n  of the same size as on the upper side.\r\n\r\n  The figure here given, is taken from the male; the female being much\r\n  larger, expanding full six inches; the antennæ being thread-like, and not\r\n  combed or pectinated as the male.\r\n\r\nThis species breeds twice in the year, namely in June and September. The\r\ncaterpillar, according to Abbot, feeds on the plane-tree (Platanus\r\noccidentalis Linn.), oak, liquidambar, and pine trees. Some of them are of\r\na tawny colour, others tawny and orange, others green. They are furnished\r\nwith long rigid hairs, and the second and third segments of the body are\r\nalso armed with two pair of short, erect, rugose horns. {18}This insect is\r\nplaced by Mr. Kirby in his new genus Cerocampa, together with Phalæna\r\nregalis, Fabr. Mr. Kirby had, however, evidently in view the caterpillars\r\nof the latter insect, when he proposed this generic name, and which are\r\narmed with numerous, long, erect, rigid spines, those near the head being\r\ncurved, and giving the insect somewhat the appearance of a cockatoo. This\r\nlarva is figured by Abbot and Smith, pl. 61, and specimens, admirably\r\npreserved by Abbot, are contained in the collection of the Entomological\r\nSociety of London, presented by Mr. Kirby. There is also considerable\r\ndifference between the chrysalides of these two insects, that of imperialis\r\nbeing more elongate, with a bifid tail, and with transverse rows of short\r\nabdominal spines, of which the chrysalis of regalis is destitute. One of\r\nthe caterpillars observed by Abbot, went into the ground on the 16th of\r\nSeptember, and the moth came out on the 4th of July. They are extremely\r\ndifficult to rear in confinement.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOCTUA SQUAMULARIS.\r\n\r\nPlate IX. fig. 3.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera. SECTION: Nocturna.

Anterior wings next the\r\n  body white, occupying more than one half. The tips are black, which\r\n  colour runs along the anterior and external margins, encircling a large\r\n  spot of a deep orange, whereon are four small triangular black spots.\r\n  Posterior wings wholly white, and very slightly dentated.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The mouth, breast, and feet are ash-coloured.

Boisduval has formed the present species, and another large Pieridean,\r\ninto the genus Iphias, which differs from Thestias, and Mancipium\r\n(Anthocharis Bdv.), in the structure of the antennæ. The larva and pupa of\r\nthis species are described and figured by Dr. Horsfield, in his Lepidoptera\r\nJavanica, pl. 3, fig. 7, and 7a, (copied by Boisduval, pl. 2A. fig. 3.).\r\nThe former is long subcylindrical, with the dorsal segments somewhat\r\nrugose, being transversely shagreened; it feeds upon the Capparis. The pupa\r\nis navicular, the head being produced into a point. The female imago\r\ndiffers from the figure here given (which represents the male), in having\r\nthe black markings more diffused.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPAPILIO PHILENOR.\r\n\r\nPlate XI. fig. 1. and 4.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

Thorax\r\n  black. Abdomen of a glossy hue. Anterior wings black, with a very glossy\r\n  greenish tinge at the anterior angle, with eight small, white, narrow\r\n  crescents on the external margin of each, which make them appear as if\r\n  dentated. Posterior wings of a dark glossy green, with two tails issuing\r\n  from them. The concave part of each scollop is edged with white; and six\r\n  whitish spots run along their edges, meeting below the extremity of the\r\n  body.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ Breast, legs, and abdomen black; the sides spotted with\r\n  cream-coloured spots, one of which appears on the inferior wings, on each\r\n  side the breast. Anterior wings, next the tips, are of the colour of\r\n  soot; but next the body, black, with five whitish spots on the external\r\n  margin, near the interior angle. The upper part of the posterior wings,\r\n  next the body, are soot-coloured; the remaining parts of them being of a\r\n  glossy blue, with seven dark orange spots, placed in a circular manner, a\r\n  little distance from the edge, and meeting at the extremity of the body:\r\n  each spot is encircled with black, except in that part where a small\r\n  silver mark appears on its edge, being represented in the plate by white.\r\n  The scollops are deeper edged on this side with white than on the upper.\r\n\r\nThis butterfly is one of the most beautiful, and, at the same time, most\r\ncommon of the North American species; abounding wherever the Aristolochia\r\nserpentaria grows, the larva feeding upon that plant. It is described by\r\nBoisduval and Abbot, and is brown, with four rows of small fulvous\r\ntubercles, and a row of brown spines near the legs; moreover, it has two\r\nlong spines directed forwards upon the first segment, three upon the\r\npenultimate, and two upon the tenth segment. The neck is also furnished\r\nwith a furcate retractile reddish tentacle; the chrysalis is of a violet\r\ngrey, or reddish colour, with two yellow spots, the head being truncate.\r\nThe female is larger, with brown-coloured wings, with cupreous reflections.\r\nThe insect assumes the chrysalis state on the 26th of April, and the fly\r\nappears on the 4th of May. Another, observed by Abbot, went into chrysalis\r\non the 21st of June, and the butterfly came out on the 5th July. The latter\r\ndelights to frequent the blossoms of the peach and other trees in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPILIO ASTERIAS.\r\n\r\nPlate XI. fig. 2. 3. and 5.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

A row\r\n  of eight or nine yellow spots runs along each wing, near the external\r\n  edge. Within these appears another row, smaller in figure 3, but larger\r\n  in figure 2, and shaped like triangles, above which are two spots, one\r\n  nearly round, the other very oblong, which last is not seen in figure 3.\r\n  Posterior wings black and dentated, with one tail issuing from each. Six\r\n  yellow spots appear near the external edge; and at the anal angle is an\r\n  orange-coloured one, with a black dot in its centre. Some specimens have\r\n  a yellow bar running transversely from the row of triangles on the\r\n  superior wings, and meeting below the extremity of the body, just above\r\n  the orange spot, as in fig. 2. In some, instead of a bar, is seen a row\r\n  of spots (as in fig. 3), which are sometimes very faint. Where this\r\n  happens, the space between this row and the six spots mentioned before,\r\n  consists of a shining blue colour; but in proportion as the yellow bar is\r\n  more or less distinct, the wings have more or less blue on them.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The under side in all the different varieties differs but\r\n  very little. The breast, sides, abdomen and feet are black. The anterior\r\n  wings of a dirty black colour, with nine yellow spots near the external\r\n  edge; above these, nearer the body, are eight others, varying in size,\r\n  and two small clouds or patches close to the anterior edge. Posterior\r\n  wings, next the shoulders, dirty black, with the inner scollops edged\r\n  with yellow crescents (appearing also on the upper side), within which\r\n  are six spots near the edge--four orange and two yellow. Seven or eight\r\n  orange spots, tipped with yellow, run circularly across the middle of the\r\n  wing. Below each spot in this row is a ray of shining blue, separated by\r\n  a strong black mark, and scattered with powder-like spots. An orange\r\n  spot, with a black centre, is placed at the anal angle.\r\n\r\nThis species is subject to considerable variation in the size of the\r\ninternal series of yellow spots, which is sometimes even entirely\r\nobliterated in the females, in which the yellow is much less brilliant, and\r\nthe spots smaller than in the males. These varieties somewhat resemble\r\nPapilio Troilus of Linnæus, with which, indeed, Drury and Smith[21]\r\nconfounded the insect here described. Godart and Boisduval have added to\r\nthe confusion by their incorrect references to our author, the first of\r\nthese writers giving figure 2 of this plate as alone representing P.\r\nAsterias, and figs. 3, 4, and 5, (which represent two distinct species) as\r\nP. Troilus, Linn. which species Drury has not figured; and both of these\r\nauthors quoting figure 2, both under Troilus and Asterias, although Drury\r\nexpressly states, that the specimens figured at 2 and 3, were reared by\r\nhim, with many other individuals, from chrysalides, sent from America by\r\nhis correspondent, who assured him that they proceeded from the same brood.\r\nThe preparatory states of P. Asterias are figured by Abbot and Smith, and\r\nBoisduval. The larva feeds upon Umbelliferæ, especially the fennel (Anethum\r\nfæniculum, Linn.), and Daucus Carota, and is very similar to that of Pap.\r\nMachaon, which species appears to be replaced in America by P. Asterias,\r\nand which makes its appearance in the perfect state three times in the\r\nyear. Abbot states, that one of the caterpillars assumed the chrysalis\r\nstate on the 12th of July, and the imago appeared on the 20th.\r\n\r\n\r\n{23}PLATE XII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPAPILIO PARIS.\r\n\r\nPlate XII. fig. 1. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

All the wings are black, but have a greenish hue,\r\n  occasioned by a multitude of powder-like specks of a fine green. On the\r\n  posterior margin of the anterior wings, near the lower corner, arises a\r\n  series of green spots, becoming weaker, disappearing near the middle of\r\n  the wing, and composed of powder-like specks. Posterior wings scolloped\r\n  or dentated, each furnished with one tail, each scollop being edged with\r\n  white. At the anal angle, near the corner, is a deep red spot, shaped\r\n  like a semi-eye, whose pupil is black; and towards the upper corner of\r\n  the wing, is a large and very splendid blue spot, appearing in some\r\n  directions of a saxon green colour, and diminishing to a line as it\r\n  approaches the semi-eye, over which it extends in an arch-like form,\r\n  being there of a fine green colour.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ It has apparently no palpi. Breast and abdomen of a very\r\n  dark brown. The superior wings dark brown at the base; from the middle of\r\n  the anterior edge of a dark ash colour, running towards the upper corner,\r\n  the tendons between being dark brown, which unite together at the\r\n  external edge. Posterior wings almost black, sprinkled, or finely\r\n  powdered, with small grey specks near the abdomen; round the external\r\n  edge is a series of eye-like rings of an orange colour, edged above with\r\n  purple.\r\n\r\nThis very handsome species is often received from China, but in an\r\nimperfect condition. The female, according to Godart (Enc. Méth. ix. p.\r\n67.) is the Papilio Bianor, Fabr. which has no trace of the shining green\r\nspot on the posterior wings. M. Boisduval, however, asserts, that this is\r\nnot correct, and that the female differs only from the male in having the\r\nground of the wings rather darker, and possessing a transverse interrupted\r\nfascia of green dots near the external margin of the upper wing; these\r\nbeing represented in Drury's figure, therefore indicate that his specimen\r\nwas of the female sex.\r\n\r\nDr. Horsfield has figured another species from Java (Lepid. Javan. pl. 1.\r\nfig. 14.), differing very slightly from the preceding, under the name of\r\nPapilio Arjuna, of which he has also figured the larva and pupa (pl. 4.\r\nfig. 11.). The former has the three first segments of the body covered, as\r\nit were, with a leathery shield, elevated behind, and ornamented with\r\nseveral ocelli; the other segments are simple; the chrysalis is\r\nconsiderably curved, with the head bifid.\r\n\r\n\r\n{24}COLIAS (CALLIDRYAS) PYRANTHE, _var._?\r\n\r\nPlate XII. fig. 3. 4.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

Abdomen white.\r\n  Anterior wings white, with a small oblong black spot near the middle of\r\n  each; black at the tips, which colour extends down the external edge to\r\n  the interior angle, and also runs a little way along the anterior margin\r\n  towards the body. Posterior wings white, without any marks or shades. The\r\n  edges of all the wings are entire.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ Breast, feet, abdomen, and anterior superior wings white,\r\n  being covered about a third part from the tips with small, longish,\r\n  light-brown streaks, making that part appear of a pale yellow. Posterior\r\n  wings of the same pale yellow with the small streaks. One sex is very\r\n  remarkable for having a number of hairs growing on the posterior edges of\r\n  the anterior wings, next the body; some of which are erect, some bending\r\n  downwards, and some lying flat on the wing.\r\n\r\nThere is much confusion respecting the specific names of this and several\r\nother Asiatic species, as may be seen from the citations in the synonyms. I\r\nhave followed the French authors in assigning Drury's insect to the\r\nPyranthe of Linnæus, although that author describes his insect as having a\r\ndiscoidal red spot on each of the wings beneath. The species of this group\r\nare variable in the intensity of their markings, and the males are less\r\nstrongly marked than the females; and as Drury's figure represents a male\r\n(distinguished by the bundle of hairs on the interior margin of the\r\nanterior wings) it may possibly be an extreme variety of the male of\r\nPyranthe. Boisduval has indeed described another species of considerably\r\nsmaller size, which is destitute of the discoidal spot (Call. minna), which\r\nalso, he considers, may possibly be a variety of C. Pyranthe.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nARGYNNIS IDALIA.\r\n\r\nPlate XIII. fig. 1.3. [female].--2. [male].\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera. SECTION: Diurna.

Above this, six small round white\r\n  spots are placed in a row.\r\n\r\nThe flight of this species is said by Drury to be exceedingly quick and\r\nrapid, so that it is very difficult to catch them, and hence they are\r\nseldom obtained in fine condition, being generally secured in a faded state\r\nwhen they are taken with more ease. The purple tint upon the upper side of\r\nthe wings is most intense, and when the insect flies in the sun, glancing\r\nbefore the eye of the observer at a little distance (for it is by no means\r\na timid creature), the vivid purple, observes Drury, is not much less than\r\nthe electrical spark, and its changes depending on the degree of obliquity\r\nwhich it presents to the sun, are scarcely less rapid.\r\n\r\n\r\n{27}NYMPHALIS IPHICLA.\r\n\r\nPlate XIV. fig. 3, 4.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

On the anterior wings, near the tips, are\r\n  two black circular spots united together: the lower one being the\r\n  largest, each having a small white one in its centre. On the posterior\r\n  wings are two black circular eyes, towards the anal angle; their irides\r\n  being of a gold colour, and the pupils white.

On the anterior wings are four eyes, the largest,\r\n  situated near the middle of the wing, is encircled with yellow, its\r\n  centre being white; below this is a small one, and two other small ones\r\n  are placed near the tips. Posterior wings, with a row of six black eyes\r\n  near the external edge, whereof two are much larger than the rest; the\r\n  irides of all being yellow, and the pupils white. That next the anal\r\n  angle is sesquialterate. In some specimens these eyes are less distinct\r\n  than in others; in some there are not more than five to be discerned, and\r\n  only one on each superior wing; in others not more than three can be\r\n  distinguished, the small ones being entirely wanting.\r\n\r\nDrury observes (Introd. to vol. iii. p. 16.) that this insect very much\r\nresembles a species sent by Mr. Smeathman from Africa, which comes out only\r\nabout sunset, and is then to be found in dark shades, wavering about\r\namongst the early flying noctuæ, and other nocturnal species. In some\r\nmanuscripts of the late Professor Weber of Kiel, in my possession, the East\r\nIndies are given as the habitat of this species.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XVI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCASTNIA LICUS.\r\n\r\nPlate XVI. fig. 1. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

The head, thorax, and base of the abdomen dark\r\n  chocolate brown; the extremity and sides of the latter dark. Anterior\r\n  wings of a fine deep chocolate brown. A narrow, irregular, and oblique\r\n  cream-coloured bar runs across the wing; between this and the tip, from\r\n  the anterior edge, runs another crooked irregular bar, of a much darker\r\n  colour, reaching almost half across the wing towards the interior angle,\r\n  the external margin being of a lighter shade. Posterior wings, having a\r\n  white bar running transversely across the wing, widening by degrees, and\r\n  ending at the anal angle. Six square orange spots also of different\r\n  sizes, are placed within the external margin of these wings.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ Anterior wings, in the middle, dark chocolate; the tips\r\n  dark fawn colour, lighter next the shoulders. The two irregular bars, on\r\n  the upper side, are here a little broader. Within the external edge are\r\n  three rather pearly white spots.

The edges of all the wings are entire.\r\n\r\nThe genus Castnia is another of those curious anomalous forms, which\r\nexhibit the characters of several groups. The general form of the wings is\r\nthat of a moth, whilst the variegated colours, indicating diurnal flight,\r\nand the structure of the antennæ are those of a butterfly. It is much to be\r\nregretted, that travellers in South America have not ascertained the\r\npreparatory states of this extraordinary group, which alone will enable us\r\nsatisfactorily to ascertain its real relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTROPACHA?

The posterior wings along the anterior\r\n  edges being verged with white, which becomes broader as it approaches the\r\n  shoulders.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this fine moth feeds upon the wild American plum (Prunus\r\nPensylvanica), garden plum, &c. It is thick and fleshy, of a pale green\r\ncolour, with a pair of small blue spots on each segment, and with two rows\r\nof short and setose yellow dorsal tubercles. One observed by Abbot, spun up\r\non the 17th of June, and the moth came out on the 30th of March following.\r\nThe cocoon is attached to a twig. The outside web is coarse, and the inner\r\ncovered with silk, like a silk-worm's cocoon. Abbot states that this silk\r\nhas been carded, spun, and made into stockings, and that it will wash like\r\nlinen. The species is, however, too rare to be of any utility in Georgia.\r\nIt is, however, much more abundant in the neighbourhood of New York, and\r\nhas been bred in England from some brought over in the chrysalis state. It\r\nis difficult to rear it in confinement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPILOSOMA ARGE.\r\n\r\nPlate XVIII. fig. 3.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera. SECTION: Nocturna. FAMILY: Arctiidæ, _Steph._\r\n\r\n  GENUS.

On each annulus of\r\n  the abdomen is a black spot, and another on each side.

It feeds, according to\r\nAbbot, upon plantain, corn, peas, and many other plants. A specimen\r\nobserved by this author was hatched on the 23d of July, spun up on the 28th\r\nof August, and the moth appeared on the 9th of September. It is said\r\noccasionally to make great devastation among Indian corn. Sir J. E.

Breast and abdomen ash colour. The wings marked\r\n  as on the upper side.\r\n\r\nThere seems little reason for doubting that this is identical with the\r\nPhalæna punctatissima of Abbot and Smith, of which the female is entirely\r\nwhite. The last named species feeds upon the mulberry, persimmon, willow,\r\nand wild cherry of America. One observed by Abbot spun up on the 16th of\r\nMay, and came out on the 1st of June. The whole brood of caterpillars feed\r\ntogether in a web, and will often entirely destroy the leaves of a small\r\ntree. The name proposed by Drury evidently alludes to the triangular spots\r\non the margin of the anterior wings, and seems quite as expressive as that\r\nemployed by Sir J. E.

The anterior edge next the\r\n  shoulders, has a small orange streak, near which an orange-coloured line\r\n  begins, running parallel with the abdomen.\r\n\r\n{36}The caterpillar is described by Boisduval as living upon several\r\nspecies of Laurus, and of a green colour, with pale blue spots, and scarlet\r\nbelly and legs, with a scarlet eye-shaped spot on each side of the third\r\nsegment. The chrysalis is gibbous, ferruginous on the back, with the belly\r\nrose-coloured, and four rows of pale blue dots. I have reverted to Drury's\r\nspecific name, which has certainly the priority, as appears from the dates\r\nwhich I have introduced amongst the synonyms. Dr. Boisduval has given\r\nanother species of this genus under the name of Palamedes, described by\r\nFabricius under that name, but considered by him to be a Nymphalis.

Above these is a\r\n  broad orange-coloured band, and next the body the wings are dark brown.\r\n  All the wings are entire.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ Anterior wings, at the base, deep clay-coloured, with some\r\n  dark brown clouds on the anterior edges and interior angles; but in some\r\n  these clouds are hardly perceptible. In some a small scolloped line runs\r\n  along the external edges, from the tips to the lower corners, of a\r\n  reddish hue; in others this is not to be seen, having a dark brown border\r\n  in that part. Posterior wings very pale clay-coloured, with a cloud on\r\n  the middle of the external edges, of a reddish brown; where (in some) is\r\n  a silver spot like a half moon. The black pupils of the six ocelli, seen\r\n  on the upper side, are, in some specimens, very small here, and just\r\n  perceptible; in others they are not to be seen. \"In short, nature forms\r\n  such a variety of this species, that it is difficult to set bounds, or to\r\n  know all that belongs to it.\"--_Drury._\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XXII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPAPILIO THOAS.\r\n\r\nPlate XXII. fig. 1. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

A yellow bar, near\r\n  half an inch broad, begins at the middle of the superior wings, and\r\n  running parallel with the anterior edges, crosses the inferior ones just\r\n  below the shoulders. Several oval and oblong yellow spots are placed\r\n  between the tips and this bar. One also is situated close above it, near\r\n  the middle of the wing; being separated from it by the tendon, which is\r\n  black. Below the bar are four small spots, beginning at the interior\r\n  angle (the first being double). Posterior wings furnished with two black\r\n  tails, having a long yellow stripe in the middle. About a quarter of an\r\n  inch above the external edge is a row of six yellow spots, whereof one is\r\n  obscured by the anterior wing; there being but five shewn in the plate.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ The breast is ash colour.

A row of eight yellow spots is situated\r\n  within the external margin, and the yellow bar, observable on the upper\r\n  side, is not to be distinguished on this. Several small yellow lines rise\r\n  at the shoulders, and expanding like the sticks of a fan, occupy almost\r\n  the chief membrane of the wing. {41}Between these, and the row of eight\r\n  spots, are two large yellow patches, which nearly take up that middle\r\n  space, with black tendons crossing them like fine threads. Posterior\r\n  wings, next the shoulders, yellow, continuing to about the middle of the\r\n  wings. External margin soot-coloured; having a broad bar of yellow above\r\n  it, whose upper side resembles a row of arches. Above this is an\r\n  irregular black bar, running from the anterior edges, across the wings,\r\n  with two small scarlet streaks at the anal angles. On this bar is a row\r\n  of blue crescents, answering to and placed just above the arch-like bar\r\n  before-mentioned; and in the centre is a faint mark of scarlet.\r\n\r\nThe caterpillar of this butterfly feeds upon the orange-trees, from\r\nParaguay to Georgia. Its back is covered with large irregular white spots,\r\nwith brown marks, which extend along the middle and posterior parts of the\r\nbody.

Close to the shoulders, in the anterior wings, rises a stripe\r\n  of sea-green, which crosses the inferior ones; and, running parallel with\r\n  the abdominal margin, ends near the extremity of the body. A little below\r\n  this is a small scarlet spot, placed near the anal angle; with two\r\n  smaller spots, of a green colour, below it. At a little distance from the\r\n  shoulders, a second green stripe, rather broader than the first, begins\r\n  at the posterior edge of the anterior wings, and crosses the inferior\r\n  ones, parallel with the first, being continued a little lower. On the\r\n  anterior wings, about the middle of the anterior edge, rises a bar, of a\r\n  fine sea-green colour, which crossing both wings, terminates at the\r\n  middle of the posterior, being narrowest at each end. A row of eight\r\n  white spots runs parallel with the external edge, ending at the lower\r\n  corner. Near the external edges of the posterior wings is placed a row of\r\n  five crescents, of a green colour.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ Breast and abdomen grey-coloured. Anterior wings light\r\n  chesnut, having a darker cloud near the anterior angle. All the green\r\n  spots and marks, seen on the upper side, are also visible here. The\r\n  ground of the posterior wings is rather paler than the anterior; and the\r\n  green marks and stripes are rather larger here, than on the upper side.\r\n  The scarlet spot, on the abdominal edge, is considerably larger on this\r\n  side. A scarlet stripe also begins on the anterior edge, and fills\r\n  completely the space between the broad green bar and the second stripe,\r\n  mentioned above, extending as low as the extremity of the body. The two\r\n  scollops, next the abdominal corner, are black; whereon appear a few blue\r\n  powder-like specks.\r\n\r\n{42}M. Boisduval states that Drury's figure is \"peu exacte.\" It is true,\r\nindeed, that the figure does not agree with the description given by that\r\nauthor, who describes the fourth pale fascia as \"bifide dans la cellule\r\ndiscoidale des premières ailes.\" The exact uniformity in the shape of this\r\nfascia, in both of Drury's figures, renders its correctness evident, and\r\nconsequently the insect figured by Drury must be regarded as a variety of\r\nthe species described by Boisduval.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XXIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNOCTUA MELICERTA.\r\n\r\nPlate XXIII. fig. 1.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

About an inch from\r\n  the shoulders springs from this line a small curved one, which, bending\r\n  towards the middle of the wing, terminates in a small eye, pointed in the\r\n  lower part, whose pupil is transparent like glass; the iris being partly\r\n  red and partly black, within which are semicircles of white; external\r\n  margin of the wings, red brown; the posterior being white. Posterior\r\n  wings furnished with two broad tails, which, at their extremities, appear\r\n  as if they were crimped; their external edges being red brown. In the\r\n  middle of each of these wings is likewise an eye, similar to, but rather\r\n  larger than those in the anterior ones. Abdomen white.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ Abdomen white, the sides being of a dark clay colour.

The anterior\r\n  margin of the inferior wings is white, and the eyes strongly resemble\r\n  those of an animal having them half shut.\r\n\r\nDrury's correspondent informed him that the caterpillar of this handsome\r\nmoth is red, and feeds on the leaves of the sassafras tree. When they are\r\nfull-fed they inclose themselves in a strong case composed of the substance\r\nof the tree, and a glutinous matter which they secrete. They appear in June\r\nand August. The caterpillar, however, figured by Abbot is green, with short\r\nhairs scattered over the body, and with about eight small red {46}spots on\r\neach segment, placed transversely. This author also states that it feeds\r\nupon the sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua, Linn.), different kinds of\r\nwalnut, and the Persimon (Diospyros Virginiana). One of them spun up on the\r\n31st of May, and came out on the 8th of June; another on the 23rd of June,\r\nand came out on the 10th of July; and a third, which did not spin up until\r\nthe 6th of September, remained in the chrysalis till the 3rd of March.

Anterior wings rusty\r\n  grey brown, with a white spot at the base, and another small discoidal\r\n  white one; a narrow irregular indented line of white begins near the\r\n  interior angle, and runs nearly to the tip; several indented lines,\r\n  nearly black, cross the wings, more or less distinct. Cilia brown,\r\n  spotted with white. Posterior wings brown, darkest in the middle, the\r\n  shoulders being nearly black, with an indented narrow bar of ash colour\r\n  running across them, from the middle of the anterior edges to the anal\r\n  angle; below this is a narrow black one, answering and joining to it.\r\n\r\n  _Under Side._ Breast and abdomen ash-coloured. Anterior wings brown,\r\n  without any marks or shades, except two very faint undulated dark lines\r\n  crossing them. Posterior wings, next the body, ash-coloured; the\r\n  remainder being like the anterior, with some faint dark lines crossing\r\n  them.\r\n\r\nAccording to Abbot the caterpillar is pale green, with white lateral\r\noblique stripes, and a pink tail. It is said to feed on the potato,\r\ntobacco, red pepper (Capsicum?), &c. One of these caterpillars, observed by\r\nAbbot, went into the ground on the 19th of June, and came out on the 15th\r\nof July; whilst another went in on the 8th of July, and came out {48}on the\r\n1st of August. The caterpillar is stated by the same author to be very\r\ndestructive in plantations of tobacco, the cultivators being obliged to\r\npick them carefully off the young plants. The chrysalis is of a chesnut\r\ncolour, with a long nearly straight tongue case, extending to the middle of\r\nthe breast, and clubbed at the end. The moth is generally seen in an\r\nevening, sucking the James-town weed and gourd blossoms, and continues\r\nbreeding all the summer; the moth is common in the West Indies, as well as\r\nin Georgia and Carolina. Dr. Brown says it is called the musquito hawk,\r\nfrom its appearing at that time of the evening when those insects abound,\r\nand being vulgarly but erroneously supposed to prey upon them. _Abbot and\r\nSmith, loc. cit._\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this American insect have from time to time been captured in\r\nthis country. \"It unquestionably cannot,\" however observes Mr. Stephens,\r\n\"be considered as indigenous, and ought to be rigidly excluded from our\r\ncabinets; otherwise the most perplexing consequences must inevitably arise,\r\nto the total confusion of our inquiries into the geographical distribution\r\nof insects. If this be admitted, as well might 'the noble monarch of the\r\nforest,' because a captive lioness which had escaped from her prison was\r\nretaken on Salisbury Plain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNTOMIS PHEGEA.\r\n\r\nPlate XXV. fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Lepidoptera.

Anterior wings brown chesnut, marked with lighter and\r\n  darker clouds, some of which are almost black; having a lighter spot near\r\n  the middle, and not far from the anterior margin. Posterior wings at the\r\n  base black, but along the external edges of a grey brown, the middle\r\n  being occupied by three bars of red, ash, and faint rose colours,\r\n  separated by three black waved lines crossing them from the anterior to\r\n  the interior.

It feeds upon\r\nthe sweet potatoe plant (Convolvulus Batatas, Linn.), and is sometimes\r\nfrequent though the moth is rare. The chrysalis is chesnut, with a long\r\ncurved tongue case, the extremity of which is recurved. It is often dug up\r\nwith the potatoes. In Virginia one of these insects buried itself October\r\n3rd, and came forth in the perfect state on the 30th of May; whilst one\r\nobserved in Georgia went into the ground on the 20th of August, and came\r\nout the 11th of September.\r\n\r\nThis species was considered by Drury and Smith as a climatal variety of the\r\nEuropæan Sphinx Convolvuli.

The first segment of the abdomen is black, the second\r\n  cream colour, the remainder alternately cream colour and olive.

It has, however, until lately been deemed one of the\r\nrarest as well as most beautiful species in the rare family to which it\r\nbelongs. Entomologists are indebted not only for a considerable number of\r\nspecimens, but, what is more interesting, for a knowledge of the habits of\r\nthe insect to William Raddon, Esq. the celebrated engraver, by whom an\r\ninteresting notice has been published in the Entomological Magazine. It\r\nfeeds upon the sea {59}spurge (Euphorbia paralias), which grows in plenty\r\non the sand hills in the neighbourhood of Barnstaple and Braunton Burrows,\r\nin Devonshire. These sand hills are of great extent, and, as suggested by\r\nMr. Curtis, must have been collected by the winds and storms to which they\r\nare constantly exposed. During the winter the whole soil is frequently\r\nremoved, so as completely to alter the surface of the country; a great\r\nnumber of the pupæ must consequently be destroyed or buried at a\r\nconsiderable distance below the surface, where probably they lie hid until\r\nthey are brought to light and life by the influence of the elements. These\r\ncircumstances account for the great irregularity in the appearance of the\r\ninsects. In 1814, for instance, they were so plentiful that Mr. Raddon\r\nfound not less than one hundred minute larvæ upon an armful of spurge,\r\nwhich he had cut at dusk the preceding evening. The rarity of the insect is\r\nalso increased by the difficulty of rearing it. The late Mr. Fuseli, the\r\nroyal academician, who was a zealous entomologist, was enabled only to\r\nobtain one moth from twenty chrysalides. The larvæ are full grown in\r\nSeptember, and the moth appears in the following June.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XXX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDYNASTES HERCULES.\r\n\r\nPlate XXX. fig. 1. [male].--2.

South America.\r\n\r\n  _Male._ Black, except the elytra, which are of an olive colour; having a\r\n  number of black spots on them of different shapes and sizes, varying\r\n  considerably in different individuals. Thorax, above, smooth, and\r\n  shining, the sides covered with a multitude of small punctures. Its front\r\n  is produced into a long shining horn, near three inches in length, which\r\n  gradually bends downwards from the base to the extremity, where it is\r\n  slightly forked; the under side being covered with short fine hairs of a\r\n  yellowish colour, resembling the pile of velvet, and having about two\r\n  inches from its extremity a strong short spine placed on each side. The\r\n  head is furnished with another horn, about two-thirds the length of the\r\n  first, sharp and thin on its upper side, and towards the end bending\r\n  upwards; having on the upper edge, near the middle, three or four teeth\r\n  or strong spines, and another near the extremity. Eyes shining, red\r\n  brown. Tibiæ armed with spines, particularly the anterior pair, which\r\n  have four; three near the tips, and one near the middle. The middle and\r\n  hinder tibiæ have each two strong spurs, and several smaller spines,\r\n  surrounded with hair on the other parts. The edge of the abdomen is\r\n  covered with a row of dark orange-coloured hairs. Several other parts of\r\n  the body, joints, &c. are also clothed with the same {60}coloured hairs.\r\n  Each of the ungues has a little tuft of strong hairs issuing from the\r\n  extremity of the terminal joint of the tarsi.\r\n\r\n  _Female._ This sex is unfurnished with horns. The elytra are the same\r\n  colour as in the male, not spotted so much, if at all, and more rugose.\r\n  Thorax black, with a few yellowish spots, formed like stars or rays on\r\n  it. In other respects it resembles the male.\r\n\r\nDrury adds to this insect the following remark--\"I have observed many\r\nspecies of beetles whose males have been furnished with horns, either on\r\nthe head or thorax, but in which the females have none, but have those\r\nparts quite smooth and plain; and my observations incline me strongly to\r\nthink that this rule subsists in every one of them, through the whole\r\nclass. The instances I could bring in support of this opinion are too many\r\nto be admitted in this place.\"\r\n\r\nThe circumstance observed upon in the preceding note is certainly very\r\ninteresting in a physiological point of view. In quadrupeds we find both\r\nsexes of cornuted species armed with horns; but in insects almost\r\nuniversally the males alone are provided with these appendages. It is also\r\nworthy of remark, that although in the majority of insects the females\r\nconsiderably surpass the males in size, yet in those species in which the\r\nmales are cornuted, the females are almost invariably smaller than their\r\npartners.\r\n\r\nBurmeister lays it down as a rule, that with regard to the differences of\r\nthe sexes, their whole character may be thus distinguished; viz. that the\r\nmale displays a preponderance of evolution, and the female a preponderance\r\nof involution; and observes, \"that some beetles have processes upon the\r\nhead and thorax, which, like the mandibles, can meet, like tongs, and thus\r\nserve as a weapon. This is asserted of Hercules and its large comrades.\"\r\nThis opinion as to the uses of these horns can, however, scarcely be\r\nmaintained, since the number of species in which the horns really meet is\r\nvery few. Kirby and Spence observe, \"What may be the use of these\r\nextraordinary appendages to the males, has not yet been ascertained.\r\nWhether the individuals of this sex are more exposed to the attack of birds\r\nand other enemies, in consequence of being more on the wing than the\r\nfemales, and are therefore thus provided with numerous projecting points of\r\ndefence, is a question worth considering.\" It is also to be observed that\r\nthese appendages, instead of being deciduous, as in many of the higher\r\nanimals, are in insects component parts of the external skeleton.\r\n\r\nThere are a few exceptions to the observation of Drury; thus in the\r\nLamellicorn genus Hoplites Dej. Catal. (Scarabæus Pan,) the females are\r\ncornuted as well as the males; and in the genus Osmia, belonging to the\r\nsection of wild bees, Dasygastres, Latr., the females alone have the head\r\nfurnished with two porrected horns.\r\n\r\n\r\n{61}BUPRESTIS (CHALCOPHORA) VIRGINIENSIS.\r\n\r\nPlate XXX. fig. 3.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Coleoptera.

Its breadth at the base is half an inch; having a small\r\n  projecting ridge running along the middle, from thence to the extremity,\r\n  at the base of the horns. Thorax an inch and a half long, being\r\n  principally black; but along the sides is flesh-coloured. It has also\r\n  five narrow and irregular waved lines of a flesh colour running from the\r\n  anterior to the posterior edges; one of which, being in the middle of the\r\n  thorax, is narrower than the rest; the two next this terminate at the\r\n  posterior edges in a fine rose colour; these next the lateral edges are\r\n  broadest, having likewise a patch of rose colour next the wing-cases.\r\n  About the middle of the thorax, these external lines separate and divide,\r\n  continuing so almost to the anterior edges, where they again unite. The\r\n  under part of the thorax is flesh colour; but in the middle of a\r\n  yellowish brown. The scutellum is triangular and black; with a clear\r\n  white central oblong mark truncated in front. Elytra beautiful\r\n  chocolate-coloured, and {62}covered with a great number of short fine\r\n  hairs, resembling the pile on velvet; the anterior part, with a narrow\r\n  and indented margin, of a cream colour, also surrounding the scutellum.\r\n  The elytra are two inches broad at the base. Legs very dark green colour,\r\n  almost black. Intermediate and posterior femora and tibiæ with dark\r\n  yellow hairs. Abdomen very dark green, furnished on the sides and edge\r\n  with dark yellow hairs. Sternum rather long.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent insect may be regarded as one of the rarest species\r\nfigured in these Illustrations. Drury states, that the specimen here\r\nrepresented was brought from Africa by Mr. Ogilvie, surgeon of His\r\nMajesty's ship the Renown, being found floating, dead, in the river Gaboon,\r\nopposite Prince's Island, near the equinoctial line. Nearly seventy years\r\nhave elapsed since the insect was first described, and yet the insect\r\nremains, as far as my knowledge extends, unique.[23] It would appear that\r\nthe specimen either belonged to or passed into the hands of Dr. Hunter\r\nafter the death of Mr. Drury, for Fabricius describes the species with a\r\ncitation of the museum of Dr. Hunter alone; and Olivier's figure was taken\r\nfrom the specimen whilst it was in that gentleman's possession. After his\r\ndecease it passed, with his collection, by bequest, into the possession of\r\nthe University of Glasgow, where it now forms one of the most interesting\r\nobjects in the Hunterian Museum. Joseph Hooker, Esq., son of Sir W. Hooker,\r\nthe highly distinguished botanist of Glasgow, tells me that the individual\r\nin question was picked up by a sailor in the river above mentioned, and\r\nthat it is stated in the MSS. of Dr. Hunter that it cost Mr. Drury £10. In\r\nthe Catalogue of the Insects of Mr. Drury, which were sold by auction at\r\nthe Natural History Sale Rooms in King Street, Covent Garden (now occupied\r\nby Mr. J. C. Stevens), on the 23rd of May, 1805, and two following days,\r\nthe 95th lot is described as \"Scarabæus Goliathus, _var._\" Whence it would\r\nappear that the insect here figured was not in the possession of Mr. Drury\r\nat his decease, and that he only possessed the insect figured in the 3rd\r\nvolume of these Illustrations, pl. 40, which evidently on the authority of\r\nFabricius he had regarded as a variety only of the specimen here figured.\r\n\r\nThe genus Goliathus is exceedingly interesting, not only on account of the\r\ngigantic size and singular form of the species of which it is composed, but\r\nalso from the geographical range of the group. Mr. Kirby observes upon this\r\nsubject, \"Mr. W. S. MacLeay has remarked to me that Goliathus Lam. appears\r\nto belt the globe, but not under one form. The types of the genus are the\r\nvast African Goliaths (G. giganteus, &c.), which, as well as G. Polyphemus,\r\nand another brought from Java by Dr. Horsfield, have, like Cetonia, the\r\nscapulars interposed between the posterior angles of the prothorax and the\r\nshoulders of the elytra, while the South American species (G. micans,[24]\r\n&c.) have not this projection of the scapulars; in this resembling\r\nTrichius; Mr. MacLeay further observes, that the {63}female of the Javanese\r\nGoliathus is exactly a Cetonia, while that of the Brazilian is a\r\nTrichius.\"--_Introd. to Entomology_, vol. 4. p. 494.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of this passage, the genus Goliathus has undergone a\r\nconsiderable revision; the South American species, Cetonia Ynca, _Fabr._\r\nbarbicornis, _MacLeay_, _&c._, have been separated from the genus by Saint\r\nFargeau and Serville in the Encyclopédie Méthodique, under the generic name\r\nof Ynca, and the Javanese species above noticed (Gol. Rhinophyllus[25]\r\n_Wiedemann_) is stated by Latreille in the Règne Animal, 2nd edition, not\r\nto belong to the genus Goliathus, but to that of Cetonia. The genus is thus\r\nrestricted to the African species,[26] with the exception of a Mexican\r\ninsect which Dejean has named Goliathus Hoffneri. The genus Ynca may thus\r\nbe regarded rather as a geographical subgenus, or type of form belonging to\r\nand representing the African species of Goliathus.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDIAPREPES SPENGLERI.\r\n\r\nPlate XXXII. fig. 1.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Coleoptera.

Linnæus\r\napplied the term pilularius specifically to the species inhabiting Italy\r\nand Spain; referring, however, to Catesby's Carolina, pl. 11., so that it\r\nis evident that this writer had never seen the North American insect.\r\nSchonher however remarks, \"scarabæus pillularius Linn. pertinet ad At.\r\nvolvens Fabr;\"[28] whilst Fabricius, although quoting Drury and De Geer\r\n(who both figure the North American species) has increased the confusion by\r\ngiving Southern Europe as its habitat. Under these circumstances I have\r\ndone our author the justice to revert to his specific name; his being\r\ncertainly the earliest systematic specific reference to the American\r\nspecies, which may be distinguished from the European one by the following\r\nparticulars:--\r\n\r\n  GENUS.

Fabricius, however, considered it as a distinct\r\nspecies, which he named Trichius succinctus. Dessau also, in the Bulletin\r\ndes Sciences Naturelles (February 1829), has published some observations,\r\nin order to prove the specific distinctness of this and two other species\r\nwith which it is generally regarded as identical. Its habits are different\r\nfrom those of the other Trichii; being generally found upon flowers, a\r\npeculiarity, with which its hirsute body and bee-like appearance apparently\r\noffer some indicatorial connexions. It is extremely rare in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYNASTES TITANUS.\r\n\r\nPlate XXXVI. fig. 3. [male].--4. [female].\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Coleoptera. SECTION: Lamellicornes.

It is eaten by many persons, by whom it is considered a great\r\ndainty. The perfect insect is called by the natives the macokko beetle. The\r\nfollowing observations, published by Mr. Drury in the introduction to his\r\nthird volume, will be read with interest from the spirit of practical\r\nutility in which they are written.\r\n\r\n\"The larvæ or caterpillars, not only of this but of all the beetles that\r\nfeed on decayed wood, seem to be rich and delicate eating, particularly\r\nthose of the Curculio palmarum (vid. Linn. Syst. Nat. p. 606. 1.), and in\r\ngeneral all those of the Cerambyces. So that every forest in the torrid\r\nzone affords a man plenty of very wholesome and hearty nourishment, who has\r\nan instrument strong enough to cut in pieces the decayed trees. This\r\nknowledge might have saved the lives perhaps of many seamen who have been\r\nshipwrecked on desert equinoctial shores, which are generally covered with\r\nthick woods. Mr. Smeathman has met with many maritime people, who, by\r\nliving on a scanty allowance of unripe fruits, crude roots, coarse seeds,\r\nnuts, and other trash, after a shipwreck, or in other cases of distress so\r\nfrequent with people in the African trade, have made themselves exceeding\r\nsick, and much increased their hardships, which by means of these\r\ncaterpillars only, might have been greatly alleviated. The very best kind\r\nof vegetable food is but poor nourishment for the labouring Europeans, if\r\nnot accompanied with animal flesh, or at least with animal or vegetable\r\noils; and such foods as seamen in distress meet with, as above mentioned,\r\nhave oftentimes very acrimonious qualities, and are dangerous even in small\r\nquantities to those who eat them at intervals, either out of mere curiosity\r\nor to gratify their appetites; while these kinds of insect foods, abounding\r\nwith a very rich and delicious oil, are consequently the most wholesome and\r\nnutritious which men in the situation above described could possibly\r\nprocure, requiring no other preparation than roasting in any manner. (See\r\nPhilosophical Transactions.) To this kind of food may be added that of the\r\ntermites and locusts in general among the insect tribes, which are not only\r\nwholesome to all, but palatable to many. At any rate they are sufficient to\r\nsupport life; and the knowledge of such a resource universally extended,\r\nmight in many instances be the means of saving the lives of adventurers to\r\ndistant climes. Besides these means of subsistence, if the botanists could\r\npoint out a plain and obvious method for men in general to distinguish the\r\nnoxious roots and herbs from those which are edible, men thrown on any\r\nthing but mere rocks and sandbanks would readily find subsistence, the kind\r\nhand of nature being extended all over the {82}surface of our globe to\r\nevery one who will accept the friendly invitation, and use the means she\r\nhas with such a motherly tenderness offered for our benefit and support.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smeathman has assured me, that in clearing the ground in Africa he has\r\nfound great quantities of roots of the yam and potatoe kind (Convolvulus\r\nBatatas), that grew spontaneously, and which the slaves from distant\r\ninterior regions knew exceedingly well, and sought for with great avidity.\r\nHe lived near two years in Africa before he found that the most excellent\r\ngreens for boiling grew wild in every open glade of the island, and even\r\nclose to his very door. I mention these things because they are all within\r\nthe power of men in the most naked, unarmed, and unprepared situation, and\r\nrequire neither fire-arms or other powerful apparatus to obtain them; and\r\nshew that in these cases, as well as many others, the study of natural\r\nhistory is of no small importance to mankind, since it may not only promote\r\ntrade, arts, and sciences, but be conducive to the immediate happiness and\r\nsafety of men's lives.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIONUS (MALLODON) MELANOPUS.\r\n\r\nPlate XXXVIII. fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Coleoptera.

Tips of the tibiæ with two long spines, those of the fore legs\r\n  having only one.\r\n\r\nThis insect very closely resembles the common English species Ichneumon\r\nluteus, Linn. It is, however, considerably larger.\r\n\r\nAfter describing this insect our author took occasion to enter into the\r\nnatural history of the family to which it belongs, namely, the\r\nIchneumonidæ, so named from the Linnæan genus Ichneumon, which last he\r\nsays, \"appears to be taken from its nature and way of life.\" He then\r\nproceeds as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"It is generally known that butterflies are produced from caterpillars, and\r\nthat these caterpillars put on different forms before they arrive to that\r\nof the butterfly; but few persons know, who have not engaged in this study,\r\nthat the bodies of these caterpillars are receptacles or habitations for\r\nlesser insects, that live and grow within them during a certain time; where\r\nthey are nourished and fed by the juices of their bowels, till they arrive\r\nto a mature age; when, by the appointment of nature, they kill their\r\nfosterers, being totally unable to live on any other kind of food but what\r\nthe intestines of these animals supply them with. The uses and advantages\r\naccruing to mankind by the institution of such a genus of insects, together\r\nwith their natural history, are the subject of the following lines.\r\n\r\n\"If we examine the glorious works of the creation, and reflect on the\r\npaternal care and wisdom of the Almighty, displayed in the preservation and\r\nincrease of all ranks and kinds of animals; that even the most direful and\r\nnoxious, have such a proportion in the scale of life, as is most agreeable\r\nto the ends of His divine providence; that the limits He hath prescribed to\r\neach, extend so far and no farther; and that each species shall multiply in\r\nsuch abundance or scarcity, as are best adapted to preserve, by a just\r\nequilibrium, the harmony of the universe: When, I say, we behold this, the\r\nmind can scarcely forbear crying out, under a rapturous sense of\r\nconviction, \"every thing is good.\" It is to this end we see the strong are\r\npermitted to prey on the weak; and that the number of the latter increase\r\nin a proportion sufficient to supply the wants of the former; it is to this\r\nend we see some feed on herbs and plants, some on fruits and seeds, and\r\nsome on flesh; each being furnished with appetites and powers, suited to\r\ntheir respective ways of life: and it is to this end, we see those of the\r\nmost minute kinds, abounding in a degree far beyond those of the first\r\nmagnitude. The knowledge of the insect kingdom illustrates this observation\r\nbeyond all possibility of doubt; and the number that may be bred from a\r\nsingle pair, in many species, would exceed all credibility, if it was not\r\nto be proved by any person who {94}would take the trouble. The wonderful\r\nincrease that only two summers would be capable of producing among many of\r\nthem, if each egg was to yield its respective insect, is amazing. The world\r\nitself, in a few years, would be incapable of affording plants sufficient\r\nfor the nourishment of one single species.[29]\r\n\r\n\"Hence will appear the 'loving kindness' of the Almighty, in setting such\r\nbounds, and keeping them within such limits as best answers the purpose for\r\nwhich He created them; and hence appears the necessity of their becoming\r\nfood to other animals. Birds, fishes, and the smaller kinds of beasts, are\r\nat eternal war with them; but as all these would be insufficient of\r\nthemselves to restrain and prevent them from multiplying too fast, other\r\nkinds of beings are instituted for this end, whose existence depends on\r\ntheir destruction. Of these, the species of insect I am describing, is the\r\nmost singular, of which (genus) there are several sorts, differing greatly\r\nin size and shape. Some are furnished with three setæ or bristles at the\r\nextremity of their bodies, the middle one being a hollow tube, secured or\r\nfenced by the outer ones, through which they eject their eggs, after they\r\nhave penetrated the body of the caterpillar they settle on. Some appear to\r\nhave no bristles, others have them bent close under their bodies, and are\r\nnot to be seen, unless closely examined. As their whole business appears to\r\nbe the destroying the caterpillars of the butterfly and moth tribes, they\r\nare indefatigable in the pursuit of them; but as this is confined to the\r\npregnant females, they are observed ranging about continually in search of\r\nthe proper subjects to lay their eggs on; flying on every bush, and running\r\nwith unwearied diligence on every twig, till they have arrived to the place\r\nwhere the scent of the caterpillar soon furnishes them with the certainty\r\nof its being there. Having thus discovered the animal it was in quest of,\r\nthe Ichneumon immediately settles on it, with an intent to discharge its\r\neggs; but the caterpillar being sensible, from a natural instinct, of its\r\nenemy's assault, bends its head backwards to the place where it feels\r\nitself attacked, and endeavours by various means, either by striking its\r\nhead violently against the part, falling to the ground, or by some sudden\r\ncontortion, to disengage itself: but this seldom happens, unless the\r\nIchneumon is feeble, and unable to withstand the shocks of the caterpillar;\r\nin which case they will frequently relinquish their attack, and seek out\r\nsome other subject, whose resistance they are more capable of encountering.\r\nOn the other hand, if the Ichneumon is strong enough to withstand the\r\nefforts of the caterpillar, it either lays its eggs on the outside of the\r\nskin, as is the nature of some to do, or else perforates the body with the\r\nbristle before described, and immediately discharges an egg. Some of these\r\nIchneumons quit the caterpillar upon the emission of an egg, but others\r\n{95}continue thereon till they have emitted them all; which sometimes is\r\nmore than an hundred. It is necessary to observe, that many caterpillars of\r\nmoths and butterflies (the former more especially) are infested by a\r\nparticular species of these Ichneumons, that confine themselves entirely to\r\nthem alone, and never, that we know of, attack any other. Thus that of the\r\nPrivet Hawk or Sphinx Ligustri of Linnæus, that of the Elephant Hawk or\r\nSphinx Elpenor of the same author, &c. are always found to yield particular\r\nkinds of Ichneumons. Others, indeed, attack any kind of caterpillar\r\nbelonging to the farinaceous-winged tribe; and, as I observed above, if not\r\ntoo powerful and strong for them, will there deposit their eggs.\r\n\r\n\"If the egg is laid on the body of the caterpillar, and not within it, a\r\nfew days, by the warmth of the sun, ripens it to maturity; and then the\r\nyoung destroyer, directed by nature, eats its passage through the\r\nunder-side of the egg, and passes into the body of the caterpillar, but if\r\nthe egg is discharged into its body, it there ripens, unseen, to maturity.\r\nIn either case, it lives on the substance or juices of its intestines;\r\nthriving and increasing in bulk, in a proportion equal to the creature it\r\nis doomed to kill. The caterpillar, also, notwithstanding its having thus\r\nreceived the means of a slow but certain death, increases in size, and, to\r\noutward appearance, in health; arriving to the period when it is to undergo\r\nits metamorphosis, and become a Chrysalis, in as much strength and vigour\r\nas any other of the species: but when the time arrives for its enlargement\r\ninto its complete state, and to become a moth or butterfly, the Ichneumon\r\nmakes its appearance; having arrived to its time of completion within the\r\nbody of its supporter, and exhausted its juices by the nourishment drawn\r\nfrom it, leaving behind it a dry empty shell, in the form of a chrysalis.\r\n\r\n\"In this manner many of these Ichneumons exist. Others, when arrived to\r\nmaturity, having lived within the bodies of the caterpillars, as described,\r\neat their way out through its sides, and, crawling to a small distance,\r\nform round themselves cases of a substance like silk; wherein, having lain\r\na few days, they quit their prisons in the shape of very small flies, some\r\nhaving two wings, others four.\"--Vide Goedartius, Albin, Wilks, Harris, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLISTES ANNULARIS.\r\n\r\nPlate XLIII. fig. 6.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Hymenoptera.

Claws black.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars relative to the economy of this species were\r\ncommunicated to Mr. Drury from a correspondent in Antigua, who forwarded to\r\nhim specimens of the insect.\r\n\r\n\"This insect is called at Antigua, and several other places in the West\r\nIndies, the Mason Fly, a name given it from the remarkable manner in which\r\nit builds its nest, or receptacle for its young.\r\n\r\n\"When the male and female have performed the business of copulation,\r\ntheir[30] next care is to provide a proper habitation for raising and\r\nsecuring their future progeny; to this end they seek out a proper spot that\r\nis secure from rains, &c. and is so situated as to afford a {100}sufficient\r\nwarmth for the young offspring, but not so hot as to destroy instead of\r\nnourishing them. The sides of a wall underneath the eaves of a house, is\r\nthe place often pitched on for this purpose. Thus prompted by nature, and\r\ninstinctively knowing the necessity of performing this work, they carry a\r\nquantity of dirt, and place it against the wall, which they temper and\r\nsoften with a liquor issuing from their bodies, that renders it\r\nsufficiently strong and tenacious, and when dry, is proof against any rains\r\nthat may happen to get at it. The nest is composed generally of about a\r\ndozen cells, that are round, and sufficiently capacious to hold the\r\ncaterpillar when grown to its full size; each of which is about an inch\r\nlong, and about three-eighths of an inch in diameter, lying parallel with\r\neach other, and formed in such a manner, that each cell lies between two\r\nothers, both above and below it, except the outward ones, having a hole\r\nleft open at the extremity of each, for the parents to go in and out at\r\npleasure. See Plate 45. Fig. 8. that at 9 being a nest supposed to be cut\r\nthrough its middle, to shew the form of the cells, and manner of their\r\nbeing built. The industry exerted on this occasion is remarkably great, for\r\nin a few days the whole is completed. There is no doubt but the heat of the\r\nclimate greatly contributes to facilitate this work, as the dirt of which\r\nit is composed is quickly dried, and by that means enables them to be very\r\nexpeditious. Their next employment is procuring a number of small spiders,\r\nwith which each cell is properly filled, and are to serve for food to the\r\nyoung brood; of these they always take care to lay in such a sufficient\r\nstore, that the young ones seldom, if ever, perish from want. I have opened\r\nmany of these cells, and constantly found a spider remaining uneat,\r\nsometimes two, and not seldom three, so that it is evident the parent\r\nanimal makes ample provision for the appetite of its young. By the time one\r\ncell is replenished with provision, the pregnant female, finding the eggs\r\nwithin her ripening to maturity, and under the necessity of discharging\r\nthem, lays a single one in the cell, and then covers up the hole with dirt,\r\nwhich was left open for a passage, in so neat and curious a manner, that\r\nthe nicest eye could not discover the place where they used to enter. She\r\nthen proceeds in the same manner to the next, and so on, till all her eggs\r\nare emitted and laid in their respective cells, each cell being furnished\r\nwith a single egg and no more. My correspondent assures me, he is not\r\ncertain whether the male assists in building the nest, or whether it is the\r\nsole production of the female; but they both equally contribute to furnish\r\nit with provision, which they carefully watch and preserve from the ants,\r\nthat in that hot climate would soon rob them of. In a little time the young\r\nones are hatched; and each, finding in its respective habitation a proper\r\nquantity of food, subsists thereon, and there lives unseen, till it arrives\r\nto its complete state. When it (the caterpillar) is advanced to its full\r\nsize, it forms round itself a brown case, as appears at Fig. 7. Plate 44.\r\nand at Fig. 10. Plate 45. and in that inclosure undergoes its\r\ntransformation; when it puts on its form as at Fig. 8. Plate 44. remaining\r\nwith its legs, wings, and horns, closed round, as is there shewn, till it\r\nhas acquired strength to break its enclosure. At its first assuming this\r\nform, it is white, soft, and tender, and its wings shorter than those in\r\nthe figure; in a few weeks its becomes hard, strong, and of its proper\r\n{101}colour. The wings, also, before that time, grow to their proper size;\r\nand now, finding itself arrived at a period when the forementioned\r\ncircumstance of its confinement is no longer necessary to its well being,\r\nit obtains its liberty, by making a hole at the end of its cell, with its\r\njaws and fore legs, large enough to permit its escape.\r\n\r\n\"The separation of the thorax and abdomen, by such a long slender membrane\r\nor ligament, is very singular, and the power the insect is invested with,\r\nby means of those jaws or forceps placed at its mouth, is really wonderful;\r\nfor the number of insects, of a superior strength, as well as size, which\r\nit is capable of destroying, is scarcely credible. It will overcome a\r\nspider of twice its own size, if it can but get upon the back of it, by\r\nmeans of its forceps and sting: nor will multitudes of other insects find\r\nit a less formidable enemy, if they are not guarded by nature with a\r\ncovering too hard to yield to the force of these destructive weapons. In\r\nshort, it seems to be an animal formed by nature, as one of those\r\ninstruments instituted for subduing and lessening the vast numbers of small\r\ninsects that abound in warm climates.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XLV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLEPTOSCELIS PICTUS.\r\n\r\nPlate XLV. fig. 1.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Hemiptera.

Fig. 2. 3.\" I have never seen the present\r\nspecies, but from the admirable accuracy of Moses Harris (by whom the\r\nfigures were drawn) it is evident that the neuration of the wings of this\r\nspecies is identical with that of Myrmeleon, agreeing especially with the\r\ninsect represented at Fig. 4. of this plate, and exhibiting the irregular\r\nlongitudinal nerve below the subcostal nerve and the strong furcate nerve\r\nrunning along the middle of the wing; whilst, at the same time, the\r\nneuration is quite unlike that of Fig. 3. Hence I have no hesitation in\r\nplacing this insect in the family Myrmeleonidæ. It however disagrees with\r\nthe genera of which that family is composed, viz.

When the\r\noriginal edition of this work was published, there was no English work in\r\nwhich the natural history and curious transformations of this tribe of\r\ninsects were detailed. Our author, therefore, in order to supply the\r\ndeficiency, published the following interesting series of observations upon\r\nthe subject:--\r\n\r\n\"As I have not met with any English author who has given the natural\r\nhistory of the insects delineated in these two plates, I shall make no\r\napology for its introduction; {107}the frequent opportunities I have had of\r\nobserving their mode of life and action, together with the many singular\r\ncircumstances observable in both, being motives for its publication too\r\npowerful to be resisted.\r\n\r\n\"It is not easy to determine whether they should be ranked among the water\r\ninsects, or those of the land, nor shall I attempt here to ascertain it; my\r\npresent business being only to relate the several circumstances attending\r\nthem during their respective states in which they are passing from the egg\r\nto the complete animal: and although these observations have been confined\r\nto our English ones, yet they so exactly agree and coincide with those of\r\nforeign countries, (as my correspondents have assured me), that their\r\nnature and behaviour appear to be just the same; so that what is observable\r\nin ours, is at the same time applicable to the whole genus wherever found.\r\n\r\n\"If we take a cursory view of the different ranks of animals that inhabit\r\nour globe, we shall hardly find one that can excite our wonder and\r\nastonishment more than this genus; nor is it from that general ignorance of\r\nthe insect world, that reigns so strongly in these kingdoms, that I am\r\nemboldened to say this; but if we reflect that the beasts, birds, and\r\nreptiles are furnished with powers for living only in the air, and that\r\neven the amphibious tribes can perform the office of respiration only in\r\nthat element: if we also consider that fishes, on the contrary, are unable\r\nto respire but in water, and when deprived of that must certainly perish,\r\nwe cannot but conclude that all these animals are most wisely fitted with\r\nmeans and faculties for filling up the respective orders and ranks wherein\r\nthey are placed. But let us cast our eyes on the subjects I am about to\r\ndescribe, and there behold a tribe of beings, who, as soon as they leave\r\ntheir eggs, subsist for a certain number of months, (I had almost said\r\nyears), creeping and swimming in the liquid element; are there invested\r\nwith organs and powers for existing and weathering out the utmost severity\r\nand intemperance of the winter; that afterwards as the spring and summer\r\nadvances, and the period arrives when they are to appear in other forms, in\r\nthe space of about half an hour those very organs and powers that before\r\nenabled them to live under water should be so entirely altered, the very\r\nnatures and abilities of the creatures so changed as to permit them to quit\r\ntheir former element and place of residence, insomuch that all the\r\nremaining part of their lives is spent in the open air, furnished with\r\nwings, and flying about in the full glee of wanton liberty; that in a very\r\nfew weeks after, having performed the business of generation, the same\r\nanimals should die of mere old age, with their wings quite ragged and worn\r\nout, their strength exhausted, and all the powers of their bodies lost by a\r\ntotal imbecility and weakness, which but a little before enabled them to\r\ntransport themselves through the air with the swiftness of a bird. If, I\r\nsay, we reflect on all these circumstances, we cannot but allow them to be\r\nobjects of a very extraordinary nature, and well adapted for leading the\r\nmind to the contemplation of their supreme Author, who has thought proper\r\nto exhibit to us these kind of insects, thus differing from almost all the\r\nanimals in the creation.\r\n\r\n{108}\"They have been variously named by different authors, owing perhaps to\r\nthe time when they wrote, or the progress natural history had made in the\r\nworld. Some have called them by the name of Dragon Fly, others Adder Bolt,\r\nBalance Fly, Perla, Libellula or Libella. I shall prefer the last, as\r\nconveying an idea well known to English adepts. The caterpillars of them\r\nall live in ponds and stagnant waters (that are undisturbed by cattle)\r\nduring the greatest part of their lives, and make their appearance under\r\nthree general forms. The first is shewn by Fig. 1. 1.; the second by Fig.\r\n2.; and the third by Fig. 3. See Plate 47. As these are the shapes in which\r\nthey all appear, it will not be improper to mention each particularly.\r\n\r\n\"The two caterpillars at Fig. 1. 1. Plate 47, belong only to or produce\r\nthose that sit at rest, with their wings erect, (see Plate 48. Fig. 2.),\r\nand differ from both the others not only in size but in the roundness and\r\nslenderness of their bodies; at the extremity whereof they are furnished\r\nwith three tails, each of which upon examination being found to be a kind\r\nof feather, and is an appendage that neither of the others have. Their\r\nbehaviour also in the water is different from the others, being enabled to\r\ntwist and bend their bodies in a more circular manner. [Subfamily\r\nAgrionides.]\r\n\r\n\"The second sort of caterpillars, at Plate 47. Fig. 2. are much shorter and\r\nthicker in their bodies than either of the others, producing those Libellas\r\nwith flat bodies, as Plate 47. Fig. 4. and 6. and Plate 48. Fig. 1. and 5.\r\nThese are, of all others, the most disagreeable in their appearance; most\r\nof them having their bodies and legs very rough and shaggy, and of the\r\nexact colour of mud. Others appear of a dirty green, and very unpleasing\r\nhue, a colour that in general reigns among them all; for none can boast of\r\nany beautiful appearance while in this state, unless the different shapes\r\nhere exhibited can be called so. Indeed the beauty and symmetry, so\r\napparent in their complete states, make ample amends for the want of it in\r\nthis; all of them in general being then very beautiful, discovering colours\r\nsuperior to art. [Subfamily, Libellulides. Genus, Libellula.]\r\n\r\n\"The caterpillars of the third sort (see Plate 47. Fig. 3.) are very\r\ndifferent from the preceding, being the size of the figure, with the\r\nabdomen flat at bottom and rounding at top, longer and slenderer than those\r\nat Fig. 2. but not so much as those at Fig. 1. 1. These produce those large\r\nLibellas with long slender bodies, who sit at rest with their wings\r\nexpanded, as Plate 47. Fig. 5. [Subfamily, Libellulides. Genus, Æshna.]\r\n\r\n\"Under these three forms are all the caterpillars of Libellas found, there\r\nbeing but little difference in the colours or marks of the respective\r\ntribes; the various sizes and shapes being the chief observable\r\ncircumstances attending them. They are all furnished with six legs, and\r\nhave each of them four little membranaceous substances issuing from the\r\nback, or upper part of the thorax, that are the follicles, or cases,\r\nwherein the wings are inclosed. When the young caterpillars issue from\r\ntheir confinement in the eggs, there is no appearance of these cases, nor\r\ntill a considerable time after; but as they arrive to a maturer state they\r\nbecome more conspicuous, and, like the young leaves of trees that open\r\n{109}and expand themselves on the arrival of the spring, their appearance\r\nincreases, till having approached the period when they are to forsake their\r\nformer habitations and become inhabitants of the air, these wing-cases have\r\nthen arrived to their due size, and carry the appearance in which they are\r\nhere seen. They are all of them, from the largest to the smallest, armed\r\nwith a strong offensive weapon, which serves them, and is indeed the means\r\nthey are endued with, for obtaining their food. This weapon being placed in\r\nthe under part of the head, just beneath the mouth, I have displayed in\r\nFig. 1. and 3. of Plate 47. where it appears just in the same manner as\r\nwhen they are endeavouring to catch their prey. In the largest figure at 1.\r\nand also in Fig. 2. it appears contracted and shut up, as when at rest. The\r\nstrength and power that these animals discover in the use of this\r\ninstrument is very singular and extraordinary. There are two joints to it,\r\none about the middle, the other underneath the mouth, close to the throat;\r\nand in some (particularly all those of Fig. 2.) when it is closed or\r\ncontracted, it appears fastened to the face of the creature, by fitting it\r\nso exactly as to form a perfect mask; covering the mouth, and reaching\r\nalmost as high as the eyes. In others it is made to fit only the under part\r\nof the mouth, and when at rest is drawn up close underneath it. At the\r\nextremity of those that are extended may be observed two very strong and\r\nremarkable fangs; that, shutting over each other, form a pair of forceps,\r\nof such strength that few, if any of their captives, can escape if once\r\ninclosed therein. [This organ is the greatly developed lower lip of the\r\nlarva, and is analogous in its structure to the same part in the imago.]\r\n\r\n\"The motion of these creatures in the water, particularly those of the\r\nlargest size, is very slow; seldom exercising any swiftness or activity,\r\nunless they are disturbed and threatened with danger, in which case they\r\ncan transport themselves to places of more security with the quickness or\r\nagility of a fish; but, in general, they appear to have so little\r\ninclination to move, that I have often seen them (I mean those that I have\r\nkept in glass bowls) remaining in their respective places above a week\r\ntogether, and could not discover the least motion in them, unless under the\r\ncircumstance above mentioned, or when they had seen their prey and were\r\nadvancing to seize it. The caterpillars of Fig. 1. 1. and 3. generally fix\r\nthemselves to some little stick or straw, &c. that they find in the water,\r\nand there remain, as I said before, without stirring. Those of Fig. 2. are\r\nmore frequently seen in motion among the thickest part of the roots and\r\nplants that grow there, routing and searching for those small animals\r\ninhabiting that part, which are their proper food. This aversion to motion,\r\nso apparent in those of No. 1. and 3., appears to me to be the effect of an\r\nextraordinary cunning and sagacity; and may be considered as the principal\r\nmeans by which they obtain their prey: for while they continue thus\r\nmotionless in the water, the small animals, who constitute their proper\r\nfood, approach them with less fear than they would otherwise do, not\r\nsuspecting their grand enemy lies upon the watch to seize them the moment\r\nthey come within his reach; but no sooner has their insensibility of danger\r\nbrought them within a small distance of those destructive weapons\r\n(mentioned before, being placed under their mouths) but that very instant\r\nthey dart upon them with {110}the utmost rapidity, suddenly throwing out\r\ntheir forceps, and seizing them with as much eagerness as a pike does the\r\nunwary gudgeon; they then bring their forceps up to their mouth with their\r\nprey in it, and feast on their captive prisoner. Nor is their voracious\r\nnature less astonishing; and the greediness with which the large ones seize\r\nother small animals would hardly gain belief among persons entirely\r\nignorant of this study. I have seen one of them, in less than an hour's\r\nspace, devour three insects, each of which was full two thirds as big as\r\nitself; but, in general, the small ones are the sacrifices made by the\r\ngreater; wherein I must observe, that when they have got a caterpillar of\r\nthe small Libellas in their forceps, such as those of Fig. 1. Plate 47.,\r\nthey leave no part uneaten, except the three tails, which they let fall to\r\nthe bottom, as perhaps not having substance in them sufficient to afford\r\nthem proper nourishment; for as their food consists altogether of animals\r\nless than themselves, they neither spare the caterpillars of the lesser\r\nLibellæ, nor confine themselves to those belonging to other tribes. They\r\nwill eagerly prey upon the different kinds of Cads, or caterpillars of the\r\nPhryganeæ; great numbers of whom, at certain seasons, quit those husks or\r\ncases they make and swim about, with less fear and dread than in the early\r\npart of the spring. I have also seen the caterpillars of the Notanecta's or\r\nBoat-flies devoured by them, and not seldom the small blood-worms, as they\r\nare called. In short, there are but few of the lesser animals that live in\r\nthe water, but when once they get within the reach of their instruments\r\nwill certainly fall victims to these freshwater Leviathans.\r\n\r\n\"I could never observe that these caterpillars ever threw off any exuvia,\r\nor skin, in their progress from the egg to the complete animal, as most\r\nother insects do that live in the open air; neither could I ever perceive\r\nany difference between the caterpillars and chrysalis's of this genus in\r\ntheir outward forms[31]: the same voracious behaviour in seizing and\r\ndevouring their prey, reigning both in one and the other; but that they\r\ninternally undergo some material alteration, when passing their respective\r\nstates, is what I do not entertain the least doubt of; as the organs of\r\nrespiration during the creature's life in the water, appear to me to be\r\nunder a necessity of receiving a great alteration, when they are to perform\r\nthe same office in so different a medium as the air; nor can I suppose this\r\nbusiness to be done in so quick and sudden a manner, as the short space of\r\ntime in which the creature would then be passing from the caterpillar state\r\nto the perfect one would permit, without having the intestines prepared, as\r\nit were, and fitted by some previous change. However, as this is conjecture\r\nonly, I shall dwell no longer on this head, my present purpose being to\r\npoint out and describe their general circumstances and behaviour.\r\n\r\n\"When the caterpillars of the respective species have arrived to their full\r\ngrowth, and nature informs them they are to quit their former element of\r\nwater, for one wherein they are to appear invested with very different\r\npowers, they prepare for this extraordinary change; and, creeping up the\r\nsticks, straws, or plants they find for their purpose, whose tops grow out\r\nof the water, they entirely quit that element, and, stopping at about six\r\nor {111}eight inches above its surface, there fix themselves, and continue\r\nsome time, till their internal form, growing too big to be confined within\r\nthe skin, that a few minutes afterwards will be entirely thrown off, on a\r\nsudden, that part of it that covers the thorax, splits or bursts on the\r\nupper side, and the creature, pushing out its head, next disengages its\r\nfore legs, which fastening to any substance within its reach, draws gently\r\nthe remainder of its body and legs entirely out, just as a man draws his\r\nleg out of a boot, leaving its slough or skin sticking in its place, and in\r\nthe exact form wherein it appeared itself but a few moments before. Having\r\nthus quitted its former covering, it waits for the wings to expand\r\nthemselves, and grow to their proper size, being before confined within\r\nthose small cases I mentioned were placed on its back. In about half an\r\nhour, if the weather is favourable, this extraordinary operation is\r\ncompleted; and the wings having arrived to their proper size, the creature\r\ngenerally makes an effort to try its strength, well knowing, that if it\r\nfails in attempting to fly without being endued with a sufficient degree of\r\nit, it must certainly fall in that water it lately quitted, and there\r\nperish; but having made several motions with its wings, and finding its\r\npower equal to its desire, it suddenly flies into the air, and there fills\r\nup a character, as different from the former as one element is from the\r\nother. At the time this change is accomplishing, the instrument or weapon\r\nfor catching their prey, before mentioned, by an effect of nature, totally\r\ndisappears, and not the least vestige of it then remains; the mouth,\r\nindeed, is furnished with jaws, and those of a very extraordinary form\r\n(dividing themselves both horizontally and perpendicularly), but no part of\r\nthem appear extended beyond the rest, or have the least appearance of being\r\nfurnished with an instrument like what they had in their former state.[32]\r\n\r\n\"Hitherto I have considered these creatures only in their infant or\r\nincomplete states; wherein the faculties and powers they are endued with,\r\nare entirely different from those of their perfect and complete ones. In\r\nthe former I have described them swimming and grovelling about in the\r\nwater, preying upon the lesser kinds of insects, being incapable of\r\nsubsisting for any length of time out of that element; in the latter we\r\nmust view them capable of flying in the open air, and conveying themselves\r\nfrom place to place. If they are then confined to the limits of a small\r\npond, they are now capable of roving from tree to tree, and from field to\r\nfield, darting and skimming along with all the rapidity and seeming joy,\r\nthat a being sensible of, and exulting in its own powers, can be supposed\r\nto do; in short, we {112}must now view them in shapes so distinct and\r\ndifferent from their former ones, that they hardly seem to bear any\r\nrelation to each other, except in their nature and appetites; for although\r\nthey appear in a far more elegant dress than when in their caterpillar\r\nstates, yet these are just the same, the same voracious inclinations\r\nsubsisting now as formerly; hunting after, and preying upon, the lesser\r\ngenera, with the same eagerness and desire as they did when inhabitants of\r\nthe water. Incredible numbers of small moths, bees, flies with four and two\r\nwings, are the daily sacrifices offered to the insatiable appetites of\r\nthese hungry gluttons; and where they devoured one insect in the water they\r\nnow destroy a hundred, if the mildness of the season will permit them to\r\nrange about in quest of them. In rainy weather they seldom or ever move,\r\nnor when the wind is very strong and boisterous. Indeed, it is not to be\r\nwondered at. The small insects, who are their proper food, being by the\r\nsame reasons prevented from being abroad, consequently are an impediment to\r\nthose motives, that so strongly induce the Libellas to fly about. During\r\nsuch inclement times they generally shelter themselves from the wind, &c.\r\nbeing suspended by their feet in a perpendicular position on some twig,\r\nthat is remote and separate from any boughs, waiting in that manner,\r\nwithout motion, for better weather and sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"I am strongly inclined to believe, that the greater part, if not all the\r\nLibellas, are two years in passing from the egg to the complete animal. But\r\nas this is a circumstance I do not remember to have seen in any author, I\r\nshall not attempt to establish my opinion as an absolute truth. I shall\r\nmention my reasons for this belief, and leave it to every person either to\r\nconfirm or confute it, as his observations shall hereafter give him an\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n\"In order to do this, it would be necessary I should mention the times when\r\neach species first makes its appearance here in England. But as this would\r\nnot only take up too much of the reader's time, (there being at least\r\ntwenty-two of them) but it would likewise be impossible to be understood by\r\nany, but the experienced adept, unless I gave figures of them all; I shall\r\ntherefore content myself with observing, that the Libella figured in Plate\r\n47. Fig. 5. though found in America, about New York, &c. is nearly the same\r\nwith our English one, differing but a very little from it, and which I have\r\ninserted chiefly as an instance to illustrate this subject. Ours is the\r\nlast species but one, that comes forth in the summer, breeding only once a\r\nyear, appearing about the 2nd of August. Therefore, to elucidate this\r\npoint, suppose we allow a fortnight or three weeks from that time for all\r\nthe Libellas of this species to make their appearance in, that nature\r\nintended should be bred that year; but in order to set this matter in the\r\nstrongest light, I shall allow a month to that purpose. If, therefore, the\r\nLibellas were only one year in passing from the egg to the perfect state,\r\nwe might justly conclude, that after the 2nd of September, (a month from\r\nthe time of their first appearing) all of this species would have arrived\r\nto their complete states; and that none of their caterpillars could be\r\nfound in the waters after that time, by reason they had all quitted that\r\nelement, and were become flying insects. This, I say, is the conclusion we\r\nmight fairly, and without presuming on the matter, make. But this is\r\n{113}very far from being the case. For let any one examine stagnant waters\r\nat any time during the months of August, September, or October, and from\r\nthence in any part of the following winter, and he will find these very\r\ncaterpillars at any of those times: and this, not in any one particular\r\nyear, but they will be found also in any one whatever, fully fed, and of\r\nthe largest size. Nor are the caterpillars of this species the only ones to\r\nbe found fully fed. Those of No. 2. belonging to the flat-bodied Libella,\r\nwill also be found very plentifully, many of them being of the first\r\nmagnitude, together with numbers of the same species, very young according\r\nto the time of year when sought for; and appearing to have been hatched\r\nfrom those eggs that were laid by parent insects in the spring; for such I\r\nmust conclude them to be, how else can we account for their smallness, at\r\nthe same time that we may find others of the largest size? We must not\r\nsuppose there can be this difference of size in the same species, owing to\r\nsome eggs having been laid three weeks or a month sooner than others; that,\r\nbeing so short a space of time as not to allow it possible for one of those\r\ncaterpillars to attain its full size, (and all the species of flat-bodied\r\nLibellas appear within a month of each other.) Nor can we be so deceived as\r\nto mistake a species of the long-bodied caterpillars, for one of the\r\nshort-bodied; the difference being extremely apparent at the first glance.\r\n\r\n\"These reasons appear to me so convincing, I should have thought myself\r\ninexcuseable to have passed them over in silence, when I was giving the\r\nhistory of these animals. I shall therefore think myself happy to have this\r\ncircumstance corroborated by future experience, or rectified and cleared\r\nup, if found to be an error. I shall only say, I have dwelt the longer on\r\nit, as it is an observation I never heard of before. I have likewise\r\nsingled out the largest Libella, and the flat-bodied ones for its\r\nillustration, as being more conspicuous by their size, and easier to be\r\nobserved than those of the smaller sorts.\r\n\r\n\"The two principles of hunger and lust, so apparent through the animal\r\nkingdom, are in no class or tribe more manifest and visible than in these\r\ninsects. The former I have described and explained through their different\r\nstates; it remains for me to shew the manner in which they obey the calls\r\nof the latter. And herein I must observe, that the different manner in\r\nwhich the act of copulation is performed, depends on the difference of the\r\nrespective kinds; the organs of generation being placed in different parts\r\nof the body, according to the distinct species. All the flat-bodied ones\r\nhave those parts placed in common with most other insects, at the extremity\r\nof the tail. In all the slender-bodied ones, the organ of the male is\r\nplaced next the breast, close to the part where the thorax and abdomen\r\nunite; while the same organ in the female lies in the very extremity of the\r\ntail, and the singular manner of these creatures coupling is a circumstance\r\nworthy of observation.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as they have arrived to their perfect state, the males seek out\r\ntheir mates, in order to propagate their species; for this purpose they\r\nfrequent ponds and standing waters, places where the females generally\r\nharbour, and when the male in the course of his flight comes within a\r\ncertain distance of her, if it be one of that species whose sexual parts\r\n{114}in both sexes are placed in the tail, he immediately flies to her, and\r\nfixing himself by his feet to the hinder part of her abdomen, bends his\r\nbody round her tail, and performs the business of generation, both flying\r\nabout all the time this act is performing; the whole transaction not\r\nexceeding the space of half a minute. Within a few hours after, the female,\r\nthus impregnated, begins to lay her eggs in the following manner. She\r\nsingles out a leaf, grass, or some such matter, that is floating just below\r\nthe surface of the water, in some pond, and, hovering in the air about a\r\nfoot above this spot, on a sudden she descends, and dips the extremity of\r\nher tail in the water, at which instant she discharges an egg, that at the\r\nmoment of its emission is inveloped in a glutinous liquid, sufficiently\r\ntenacious to enable it to adhere firmly on the floating substance\r\nabove-mentioned without sinking. In this manner she continues depositing\r\nthem till she has discharged the proper quantity, hovering in the air all\r\nthe time, and emitting them as fast as the pendulum of a clock performs its\r\nvibrations; placing them close to one another in no regular or exact order.\r\nWhether she discharges at one time all her quantity of eggs, or only those\r\nthat were fecundated and ready for emission, waiting to have the remaining\r\neggs within her again fecundated by the male, or whether the first act of\r\ncopulation sufficiently impregnates the whole quantity which she discharges\r\nat different times, as nature ripens them, is a circumstance I cannot\r\ndetermine. However this may be, it is certain she does not discharge them\r\nall at once; but comes again to the same place, when those within her are\r\nready for emission, and there lays them in the same manner as at first.\r\n\r\n\"In this manner all the flat-bodied Libellas copulate and lay their eggs;\r\nthe others, which are formed with slender bodies, behave very differently\r\nin every circumstance; for in each of those species, when the male has\r\nsingled out its mate, he flies to her, and by means of two little bony\r\nsubstances placed at the end of his tail, issuing on each side, and\r\ncomposing a kind of forceps, he fixes himself to the forepart of her neck,\r\nclose behind the head, the female discovering no sign of fear while he is\r\nperforming this action; having fixed himself in this position, he remains\r\nthere several days, sometimes appearing with his body quite erect, at other\r\ntimes bending himself, and settling with his legs on the same substance she\r\nmay happen to alight on, without ever quitting his hold; but flies through\r\nthe air, thus united, wherever the fancy or inclination of the female\r\ndisposes her to go. This behaviour we must consider as a prelude to\r\ncopulation, for that is not performed till a considerable time after they\r\nare thus united; and therefore I look on it as a wooing, or act of\r\ncourtship in the male. But having remained a sufficient time in this\r\nmanner, that is, till the female is disposed to receive him, she bends her\r\ntail round to that part where I described the organ of generation to be\r\nplaced in the male, and, being still held fast by the neck, in that\r\nattitude they perform the mandate of nature. This action being over, that\r\nin the smaller kinds takes up a considerable space of time (for I have\r\nknown them in this posture above eighteen hours) the female soon after\r\nbegins to lay her eggs. She flies to some rush, reed, or other plant\r\ngrowing in the water, and settling close to its edge dips {115}the end of\r\nher tail a little below the surface, and fixes her eggs to the rush or\r\nsubstance she is settled on; which, by means of the glutinous matter all\r\neggs of this kind are surrounded with, adheres sufficiently fast, and there\r\nremains till the heat of the sun has brought the young animal into life;\r\nwhich immediately on quitting its confinement sinks to the bottom, or\r\nrepairs to the place where nature directs it to seek out its food.\r\n\r\n\"In this manner all the slender-bodied tribe behave, differing only in some\r\nparticular circumstances; as, for instance, the largest Libellas, as that\r\nat Fig. 5. Pl. 47. are not near so long in copulating or wooing as the\r\nsmall ones; for by the former this act is performed in a very short space,\r\nand while they are flying about in the air. Others, of a smaller size, are\r\nless quick in this performance; and as we descend to the smallest species,\r\nwe shall find they take by much the longest time; observing, by the way,\r\nthat all these slender-bodied ones lay their eggs in the same manner, that\r\nis, by fixing them to some substance to which they adhere, till they are\r\nripened into life. My experience well informing me they never scatter them\r\nin any loose careless manner as some insects do, but are placed in such\r\nproper and apt situations as to receive the influence of the sun to bring\r\nthem to maturity.\r\n\r\n\"If we attentively consider these creatures, either in their caterpillar or\r\ncomplete states, we cannot help concluding them to be a rank of beings of\r\ngreater benefit and advantage to mankind than they appear to be at first\r\nview; for, not to mention their being annual 'ministers of nature,' they\r\nare appointed by the great Governor of the universe as grand instruments\r\nfor assisting to preserve that equilibrium so apparently reigning through\r\nthe insect world, and which all who have made any progress in the study of\r\nnatural history unanimously confess. Hence the voracious disposition of the\r\nLibellas is wisely made to answer a most necessary and beneficial purpose;\r\nand the great numbers of small insects which are daily sacrificed to their\r\ninsatiable appetites, both in their caterpillar as well as complete states,\r\nis as strong an instance as any I know of the necessity and propriety of\r\nthe existence of these animals. The general principle reigning through the\r\nwhole animal kingdom, of the stronger preying upon the weak and\r\ndefenceless, can hardly be explained to the purpose of being useful to\r\nmankind, and agreeable to the laws of nature, in any one instance more than\r\nis evidently to be observed in the subjects I have been describing. The\r\nleast reflection will confirm this; for if the food of the Libellas when in\r\ntheir complete forms had consisted of the leaves of plants, like the locust\r\ngenus, and not of those small insects they now prey on; or had it, like the\r\nbeetle tribe, consisted of the superfluous parts of nature, as the putrid\r\ncarcases of dead animals, rotten wood, &c. how great a chasm would there\r\nhave been in the universal chain? how evident and conspicuous would it have\r\nappeared? and how could the vast number of small insects, increasing every\r\nday during the summer, be restrained and lessened? what genus of the\r\ntransparent-winged class could possibly have performed this business\r\nsingly? or could all the genera of flies, and even birds that we know of,\r\nhave accomplished this end? could all the Dipteræ, or any other {116}kinds\r\nthat prey on the lesser genera, have prevented such an increase of them as\r\nto become in a little time a plague too great to be borne? No. The Almighty\r\nCreator has most wisely constituted this genus for executing His commands\r\nin the manner I have described; and for this reason they must be considered\r\nas beings of greater consequence than the inconsiderate part of mankind\r\nallow them to be.\r\n\r\n\"Nor is this the only advantage arising from their existence. The still\r\nwaters, where these creatures are inhabitants during their infant state,\r\nare in some degree by their assistance preserved sweet and good, that\r\notherwise might corrupt and putrify, for the motion the waters receive by\r\nthese insects is not trifling; the respiration they perform in that element\r\nbeing observable by a close attention, which, together with that and the\r\nmotion of thousands of other insects, does in some measure contribute to\r\nkeep it sweet and wholesome.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XLVII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLIBELLULA LYDIA.\r\n\r\nPlate XLVII. fig. 4.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Neuroptera.

Abdomen green, with several yellow rings surrounding\r\n  it, and about the same length as the tegmina. Legs green; the thighs\r\n  being armed with spines.\r\n\r\nOur author states, that he was informed by a gentleman who lived several\r\nyears at Sierra Leone, and by whom this species was communicated to him,\r\nthat \"they appear about the end of June, and soon afterwards retire among\r\nthe branches of the palm trees, where they reside till the violent rains\r\ncompel them to quit that situation, and live among the plants, &c. on the\r\nground.\" In the Introduction to the third volume, he however states on the\r\nauthority of Mr. Smeathman, that \"this beautiful locust is an inhabitant of\r\nthe sandy plains, called Savannas, which indeed abound with palms; but my\r\nfriend is in doubt whether they have any kind of predilection for those\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\"'Although the hot climates abound in every part with insects of the locust\r\nand cicada kinds, insomuch that their chirping, particularly that of the\r\ncicadas, becomes in some instances intolerable; yet in the sandy plains\r\nbefore mentioned, which are thinly covered with grass, their numbers are\r\nimmensely greater, and of various kinds, sizes, and colours, skipping or\r\nflirting about in all directions at every step of the traveller.' Perhaps,\r\nindeed, their kinds may not be so various as one would at first imagine,\r\nthe same insect differing so much from itself in the various periods of its\r\nlife. From the fact however here mentioned, it seems most certain that\r\nthese insects breed under ground in Africa, as well as in these climates,\r\naccording to Linnæus and other entomologists.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the knowledge which we possess at the present time relative to the\r\neconomy of this tribe of insects, it is necessary to observe, upon the last\r\nabove-quoted passage, that the term \"breeding under ground,\" must be\r\nrestricted to the mere circumstance of the eggs being buried beneath the\r\nsurface of the earth, because the insects in all their active stages\r\n(including that of the pupa) feed upon grass and other vegetable substances\r\nabove ground.\r\n\r\nIn following up the very proper plan proposed and partially effected by Mr.\r\nKirby, in the Zoological Journal, of restoring to the primary divisions of\r\nthe Linnæan genus Gryllus the names which he gave to them, and which have\r\nbeen so confusedly employed by Fabricius and the French entomologists, and\r\nof which I have elsewhere given a more complete explanation, it is\r\nnecessary that the generic name Locusta should be restored to the true\r\nmigratory locusts composing the genus Acrydium of Latreille, and that a new\r\nname (Rutidoderes) should be given to the subgenus Acrydium of Serville,\r\ncomprising the present and other allied species.\r\n\r\n\r\n{121}LOCUSTA TARTARICA?\r\n\r\nPlate XLIX. fig. 2.\r\n\r\n  ORDER: Orthoptera.

Tegmina dark buff-coloured, almost transparent, variegated\r\n  with stripes and spots of different shapes; those next the shoulders\r\n  being nearly black, and those toward the extremity more transparent.\r\n  Wings very thin, and more transparent than the tegmina, being of a\r\n  greenish hue. Abdomen light brown on the sides; having a small stripe of\r\n  a paler colour running along it, and on the upper ridge is black. Legs\r\n  pale brown. Hinder thighs almost square, the outer sides being white and\r\n  prettily chequered, which, when viewed by a magnifier, seem like scales\r\n  laid over one another; on the outside of the tibiæ is a round white spot,\r\n  and over that a long black one.

Its general colour, as he was informed,\r\n  is green; but having received it in spirits, it had become of a dusky\r\n  brown colour. Head small and long, reaching almost to the fore legs.

Our author appears to have\r\nbeen aware of this, but he incorrectly describes it as the caterpillar of\r\nan insect like that at Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nG. NORMAN, PRINTER, MAIDEN LANE, COVENT GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n [1] The original title of this work, Vol. I., was \"Illustrations of\r\n     Natural History, wherein are exhibited upwards of two hundred and\r\n     forty figures of EXOTIC INSECTS, according to their different genera,\r\n     very few of which have hitherto been figured by any author, being\r\n     engraved and coloured from nature, with the greatest accuracy, and\r\n     under the author's own inspection; on fifty copper-plates; with a\r\n     particular description of each Insect, interspersed with remarks and\r\n     reflections on the nature and properties of many of them, by D. Drury,\r\n     1770.\" The second volume containing upwards of two hundred and twenty\r\n     figures, on fifty copper-plates, appeared in 1773; and the third\r\n     containing upwards of two hundred figures, also on fifty plates, was\r\n     not published until 1782. The majority of the plates were drawn and\r\n     engraved by the celebrated Moses Harris, but some of the plates in the\r\n     last volume were by a different hand.\r\n\r\n [2] A similar compilation bringing down the science to the present time\r\n     would be invaluable, even with all the inaccuracies charged to Gmelin.\r\n\r\n [3] This is evident from Gmelin's occasionally copying some of Fabricius'\r\n     erroneous references, e.g. Bombyx ornatrix, Gmel. p. 2444. with a\r\n     reference to Drury, v. I. t. 74. as in Fabr. Syst. Ent. p. 586.\r\n     instead of tab. 24.\r\n\r\n [4] Subsequently purchased by the Linnæan Society.\r\n\r\n [5] This contemplated edition of the Syst. Nat. never appears to have been\r\n     published.\r\n\r\n [6] I find no notice of this contemplated fourth volume amongst Drury's\r\n     manuscripts.\r\n\r\n [7] See Goedartius, translated by Dr. Lister.\r\n\r\n [8] See Swammerdam's Book of Nature, translated by Dr. Hill.\r\n\r\n [9] There is a species of ants in Africa, exceedingly numerous, and\r\n     continually ranging from place to place; not dwelling in colonies or\r\n     hills, as we see them in England; being armed with strong jaws or\r\n     forceps, and whatever animal they assail in the course of their\r\n     travels, they generally by means of their numbers overcome; there\r\n     being no method of securing themselves, or preserving their lives, but\r\n     by running into the water. The blacks, as I have been informed by\r\n     gentlemen who have lived there, will get out of their way, or quit\r\n     their habitations, taking their children, &c. with them, and wait till\r\n     the ants have passed them. So numerous is this host, that a deer, hog,\r\n     &c. being killed and left on the ground, in one night will have the\r\n     flesh entirely cleared from the bones, and made a complete skeleton.\r\n\r\n[10] If any person is inclinable to make this trial, I must advise him to\r\n     collect them in the spring, when they abound with this liquor, and to\r\n     choose only the females, whose bodies at that season are so large,\r\n     being as it were overcharged with oil and a great number of eggs, that\r\n     they seem with difficulty to drag them along. When they have\r\n     discharged their eggs, they appear much less, and are not furnished\r\n     with that oil they before abounded with. The males have little, if any\r\n     of it, therefore are not proper for the purpose. This insect is of a\r\n     blue colour, and found in the fields during the months of April and\r\n     May, in the state I have mentioned; the blue colour is not shining and\r\n     beautiful as that on the belly and legs of the blue dung beetle, but\r\n     of a fine mazarine blue, without that polish. It is about an inch and\r\n     half long (the males are shorter), the head and thorax about\r\n     five-eighths of an inch, being very small and slender for the size of\r\n     the insect.\r\n\r\n[11] I have seen in the cabinet of a very curious lady, sister to Ralph\r\n     Willett, Esq. of Dean Street, Soho, not less than forty of this\r\n     species, being taken near his seat at Morley Place, near Winbourn, in\r\n     Dorsetshire, where she informed me they were found in great plenty\r\n     during the month of June or July, frequenting the privet trees. I have\r\n     also found them in the environs of London, but not plentifully.\r\n\r\n[12] The synonyms of this author are all taken from the 12th edition.\r\n\r\n[13] The primary division of the Annulose subkingdom, now adopted, is into\r\n     classes, Crustacea, Arachnida, Insecta.\r\n\r\n[14] The primary division of the class Insecta, now adopted, is into\r\n     orders, Lepidoptera (called farinaceous by Drury), Coleoptera (called\r\n     crustaceous by Drury), &c.\r\n\r\n[15] In consequence of the great increase of the science it has been found\r\n     necessary to divide the Orders of Insects into Sections, Families,\r\n     Subfamilies, &c. before arriving at Genera, which are now much more\r\n     limited than in the time of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[16] There is no branch of natural history where the existence of a _Lusus\r\n     Naturæ_ is so plain and observable as in this, particularly among the\r\n     insects brought from warm climates; where the wantonness and\r\n     luxuriance of nature is so great; that its laws, strict and regular as\r\n     they are, through the rest of the animal creation, almost seem to be\r\n     invaded and broke in upon. Instances, also, are frequent in this\r\n     study, of a cluster of eggs being discharged by a female, the insects\r\n     springing from which, have differed in the circumstances\r\n     above-mentioned so very greatly, as in some cases to be mistaken for\r\n     different species.\r\n\r\n[17] In these definitions, I have thought it serviceable to give the modern\r\n     names without introducing those, now out of use, employed by Drury,\r\n     &c. The most conspicuous parts are alone noticed. (_J. O. W._)\r\n\r\n[18] By five eyes, I mean those that have three lesser ones, as in Plate\r\n     43, 44, 45, &c. See the Plate in the Preface, fig. 4.\r\n\r\n[19] They are part of and give support to the hind pair of legs.\r\n\r\n[20] The name of this African species has not been recorded. The following\r\n     additional observations by Mr. Smeathman will be serviceable in\r\n     enabling us to obtain an idea of the treasures which, even yet,\r\n     European entomologists may expect to receive from this but little\r\n     investigated quarter of the globe. \"The whole country of Africa,\r\n     within the tropics, is one immense forest, except where the sandy\r\n     plains are too unsettled to afford a proper footing for vegetation.\r\n     Wherever any inhabitants settle, they make plantations by cutting down\r\n     the woods and burning them to fertilize the ground, and never sow two\r\n     years together on the same spot, but let the trees grow up again for\r\n     two or three years, by way of fallow, before they attempt to get\r\n     another crop from it. It is these spots, which Smeathman calls recent\r\n     plantations, which afford the greatest variety of insects and the\r\n     easiest obtained. In the second and third year they become impassable\r\n     to human feet.\"\r\n\r\n[21] Sir J. E. Smith states that the Linnæan cabinet does not contain a\r\n     specimen of this insect, nor of the Ilioneus of \"the Insects of\r\n     Georgia,\" pl. 2, one of the figures of which was considered by Mr.\r\n     Jones, the celebrated lepidopterist, to be the Linnæan Troilus.\r\n     Nevertheless, on the authority of the Banksian cabinet labelled (from\r\n     recollection alone) by Fabricius, Sir J. E. Smith gave the Asterias\r\n     under the name of Troilus, and the true Troilus as a new species.\r\n\r\n[22] From the peculiar power of contraction and elongation possessed by\r\n     these segments, and which is found in the caterpillars of other\r\n     species of Deilephila, these insects have obtained the name of\r\n     Elephant-hawk Moths.\r\n\r\n[23] Since this was written, I have been favoured by Mr. MacLeay with an\r\n     inspection of his magnificent collection, which possesses a Goliathus,\r\n     nearly resembling the insect here figured, and which that gentleman\r\n     considers as a variety of this. It is, however, considerably smaller,\r\n     and the horns of the head are not so much developed.\r\n\r\n[24] Goliath. micans is an inhabitant of Africa, and not of South America,\r\n     it is figured in the 2nd vol. of these Illustrations, pl. 32.\r\n\r\n[25] The female of this insect and two other new species of Goliathus, are\r\n     described by M. L. Buquet, in the Annales de la Société Entomologique\r\n     de France, for 1835 and 1836.\r\n\r\n[26] Hence I have not adopted De Lamarck's specific name Africanus, which\r\n     is of course applicable to all the species.\r\n\r\n[27] These scales, which Drury in his description called \"the abdominal\r\n     scales,\" are the dilated trochanters of the posterior pair of legs.\r\n\r\n[28] If this had really been the case, the Fabrician name ought surely to\r\n     have yielded to that of Linnæus.\r\n\r\n[29] \"Let no one that is unacquainted with this study, suppose that there\r\n     is any exaggeration in this account; or that what I have related, is\r\n     done with a view to catch the opinion of the public. Far from it.\r\n     Every adept knows it, and to every adept I would appeal.\r\n\r\n     \"I have counted above three hundred eggs, contained in the bag of a\r\n     spider; and I have observed more than that number laid by a water\r\n     insect (Phryganea) on a blade of grass, by a river side. The moth,\r\n     common in our gardens, named the _Great Tiger_ (or Caja of Linnæus),\r\n     lays above six hundred eggs; and almost double that number I have\r\n     known discharged by a _Long Legs_, as it is called, or Tipula of\r\n     Linnæus. Goedartius mentions two thousand worms that he plainly\r\n     counted, springing from their parent insect, and imagines there were\r\n     three thousand bred from the same animal.\r\n\r\n[30] From our information respecting the habits of the indigenous and\r\n     European species of Fossorial Hymenopterous insects, including the\r\n     Pelopæus spirifex, it is evident that the male takes no share in the\r\n     labour of constructing the nest. See my memoirs upon this subject in\r\n     the \"Annales de la Société Entomologique de France,\" for 1836, and the\r\n     Transactions of the Entomological Society of London, vol. i. for the\r\n     same year, and the Memoirs of Saint Fargeau and Shuckard therein\r\n     referred to.\r\n\r\n[31] The presence of the dorsal wing cases indicates the arrival of the\r\n     insect at the pupa state.\r\n\r\n[32] \"The morning is the time they generally choose for completing this\r\n     change, because I am pretty certain it is in their power to retard\r\n     this regeneration considerably, if I can judge from concurrent\r\n     circumstances attending those I have kept in glass bowls, on purpose\r\n     to observe their nature and behaviour. In one of these I have seen two\r\n     libella-caterpillars, that were fully grown, for three days\r\n     successively creep up the straws out of the water, in order to undergo\r\n     their transformation; but finding themselves deprived of the\r\n     sun-shine, (a circumstance generally attending this performance,) or\r\n     at least that agreeable warmth of air so necessary for their purpose,\r\n     they retired into the water: in an hour's time they made another\r\n     essay, but finding the same circumstances subsisting as before, they\r\n     again retired under water, and this they continued doing for three\r\n     mornings; till at length one of them, wearied out by those frequent\r\n     efforts, the period of nature not being to be totally avoided or\r\n     suppressed, although it might be retarded, perished in the water,\r\n     being at length so weak as to be unable to creep above its surface.\r\n     The other, on removing the vessel into the sunshine, yielded its\r\n     proper insect.\"",
