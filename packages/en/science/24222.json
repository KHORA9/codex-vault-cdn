This eclipse, though only\r\nvisible as a partial one in England, will be total no further off than\r\nPortugal and Spain. Considering also that the line of totality will pass\r\nacross a large tract of country forming part of the United States, it\r\nmay be inferred that there will be an enormous number of\r\nEnglish-speaking spectators of the phenomenon. It is for these in\r\ngeneral that this little book has been written. For the guidance of\r\nthose who may be expected to visit Portugal or Spain, a temporary\r\nAppendix has been prepared, giving a large amount of information showing\r\nhow those countries can be best reached, whether by sea or overland,\r\nfrom the shores of England.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is inclined to doubt whether an eclipse expedition is likely\r\nto provide non-astronomical tourists with incidents of travel, pleasant,\r\nprofitable, and even amusing, perhaps the doubt will be removed by a\r\nperusal of the accounts of Sir F. Galton's trip to Spain in 1860\r\n(_Vacation Tourists in 1860_, p. 422), or of Professor Tyndall's trip to\r\nAlgeria in 1870 (_Hours of Exercise in the Alps_, p. 429), or of\r\nProfessor Langley's Adventures on Pike's Peak in the Rocky Mountains,\r\nColorado, U.S., in 1878 (_Washington Observations_, 1876, Appendix III.\r\np. 203); or of some of the many Magazine and other narratives of the\r\nNorway eclipse of 1896 and the Indian eclipse of 1898.\r\n\r\nSubject to these special points no further prefatory explanation seems\r\nneeded, the general style of the contents being, _mutatis mutandis_,\r\nidentical with the contents of the Volumes which have gone before.\r\n\r\nI have to thank my friend, Dr. A. M. W. Downing, the Superintendent of\r\nthe _Nautical Almanac_, for kindly verifying the calculations in\r\nchapters II. and III.\r\n\r\n                                                 G. F. C.\r\nNORTHFIELD GRANGE,\r\n    EASTBOURNE, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS.\r\n\r\nCHAP.

Now and again when something remarkable\r\nhappens, such as a great thunderstorm, or an earthquake, or a volcanic\r\neruption, or a brilliant comet, or a total eclipse, something in fact\r\nwhich has become the talk of the town, our friend will condescend to\r\ngive the matter the barest amount of attention, whilst he is filling his\r\npipe or mixing a whisky and soda; but there is not in England that\r\ngeneral attention given to the displays of nature and the philosophy of\r\nthose displays, which certainly is a characteristic of the phlegmatic\r\nGerman. However, things are better than they used to be, and the\r\nforthcoming total eclipse of the Sun of May 28, 1900 (visible as it will\r\nbe as a partial eclipse all over Great Britain and Ireland, and as a\r\ntotal eclipse in countries so near to Great Britain as Spain and\r\nPortugal, to say nothing of the United States), will probably not only\r\nattract a good deal of attention on the part of many millions of\r\nEnglish-speaking people, but may also be expected to induce a\r\nnumerically respectable remnant to give their minds and thoughts, with a\r\ncertain amount of patient attention, to the Science and Philosophy of\r\nEclipses.\r\n\r\nThere are other causes likely to co-operate in bringing this about. It\r\nis true that men's minds are more enlightened at the end of the 19th\r\ncentury than they were at the end of the 16th century, and that a trip\r\nto Spain will awaken vastly different thoughts in the year 1900 to those\r\nwhich would have been awakened, say in the year 1587; but for all that,\r\na certain amount of superstition still lingers in the world, and total\r\neclipses as well as comets still give rise to feelings of anxiety and\r\nalarm amongst ill-educated villagers even in so-called civilized\r\ncountries. Some amusing illustrations of this will be presented in due\r\ncourse. For the moment let me content myself by stating the immediate\r\naim of this little book, and the circumstances which have led to its\r\nbeing written. What those circumstances are will be understood generally\r\nfrom what has been said already. Its aim is the unambitious one of\r\npresenting in readable yet sound scientific language a popular account\r\nof eclipses of the Sun and Moon, and (very briefly) of certain kindred\r\nastronomical phenomena which depend upon causes in some degree similar\r\nto those which operate in connection with eclipses. These kindred\r\nphenomena are technically known as \"Transits\" and \"Occultations.\"\r\nPutting these two matters entirely aside for the present, we will\r\nconfine our attention in the first instance to eclipses; and as eclipses\r\nof the Sun do not stand quite on the same footing as eclipses of the\r\nMoon, we will, after stating the general circumstances of the case, put\r\nthe eclipses of the Moon aside for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                            GENERAL IDEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary meaning of the word \"Eclipse\" ([Greek: ekleipsis]) is a\r\nforsaking, quitting, or disappearance. Hence the covering over of\r\nsomething by something else, or the immersion of something in something;\r\nand these apparently crude definitions will be found on investigation to\r\nrepresent precisely the facts of the case.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Earth and the Moon are for our present purpose\r\npractically \"solid bodies,\" each must cast a shadow into space as the\r\nresult of being illuminated by the Sun, regarded as a source of light.\r\nWhat we shall eventually have to consider is: What results arise from\r\nthe existence of these shadows according to the circumstances under\r\nwhich they are viewed? But before reaching this point, some other\r\npreliminary considerations must be dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe various bodies which together make up the Solar system, that is to\r\nsay, in particular, those bodies called the \"planets\"--some of them\r\n\"primary,\" others \"secondary\" (_alias_ \"Satellites\" or \"Moons\")--are\r\nconstantly in motion. Consequently, if we imagine a line to be drawn\r\nbetween any two at any given time, such a line will point in a different\r\ndirection at another time, and so it may occasionally happen that three\r\nof these ever-moving bodies will come into one and the same straight\r\nline. Now the consequences of this state of things were admirably well\r\npointed out nearly half a century ago by a popular writer, who in his\r\nday greatly aided the development of science amongst the masses. \"When\r\none of the extremes of the series of three bodies which thus assume a\r\ncommon direction is the Sun, the intermediate body deprives the other\r\nextreme body, either wholly or partially, of the illumination which it\r\nhabitually receives. When one of the extremes is the Earth, the\r\nintermediate body intercepts, wholly or partially, the other extreme\r\nbody from the view of the observers situate at places on the Earth which\r\nare in the common line of direction, and the intermediate body is seen\r\nto pass over the other extreme body as it enters upon or leaves the\r\ncommon line of direction. The phenomena resulting from such\r\ncontingencies of position and direction are variously denominated\r\n_Eclipses_, _Transits_, and _Occultations_, according to the relative\r\napparent magnitudes of the interposing and obscured bodies, and\r\naccording to the circumstances which attend them.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThe Earth moves round the Sun once in every year; the Moon moves round\r\nthe Earth once in every lunar month (27 days). I hope everybody\r\nunderstands those essential facts. Then we must note that the Earth\r\nmoves round the Sun in a certain plane (it is nothing for our present\r\npurpose what that plane is). If the Moon as the Earth's companion moved\r\nround the Earth in the same plane, an eclipse of the Sun would happen\r\nregularly every month when the Moon was in \"Conjunction\" (\"New Moon\"),\r\nand also every month at the intermediate period there would be a total\r\neclipse of the Moon on the occasion of every \"Opposition\" (or \"Full\r\nMoon\"). But inasmuch as the Moon's orbit does not lie in quite the same\r\nplane as the Earth's, but is inclined thereto at an angle which may be\r\ntaken to average about 5-1/8°, the actual facts are different; that is to\r\nsay, instead of there being in every year about 25 eclipses (solar and\r\nlunar in nearly equal numbers), which there would be if the orbits had\r\nidentical planes, there are only a very few eclipses in the year, never,\r\nunder the most favourable circumstances, more than 7, and sometimes as\r\nfew as 2. Nor are the numbers equally apportioned. In years where there\r\nare 7 eclipses, 5 of them _may_ be of the Sun and 2 of the Moon; where\r\nthere are only 2 eclipses, both _must_ be of the Sun. Under no\r\ncircumstances can there be in any one year more than 3 eclipses of the\r\nMoon, and in some years there will be none. The reasons for these\r\ndiversities are of a technical character, and a full elucidation of them\r\nwould not be of interest to the general reader. It may here be added,\r\nparenthetically, that the occasions will be very rare of there being 5\r\nsolar eclipses in one year. This last happened in 1823,[2] and will\r\nonly happen once again in the next two centuries, namely in 1935. If a\r\ntotal eclipse of the Sun happens early in January there may be another\r\nin December of the same year, as in 1889 (Jan. 1 and Dec. 22). This will\r\nnot happen again till 2057, when there will be total eclipses on Jan. 5\r\nand Dec. 26. There is one very curious fact which may be here\r\nconveniently stated as a bare fact, reserving the explanation of it for\r\na future page, namely, that eclipses of the Sun and Moon are linked\r\ntogether in a certain chain or sequence which takes rather more than 18\r\nyears to run out when the sequence recurs and recurs _ad infinitum_. In\r\nthis 18-year period, which bears the name of the \"Saros,\" there usually\r\nhappen 70 eclipses, of which 41 are of the Sun and 29 of the Moon.\r\nAccordingly, eclipses of the Sun are more numerous than those of the\r\nMoon in the proportion of about 3 to 2, yet at any given place on the\r\nEarth more lunar eclipses are visible than solar eclipses, because the\r\nformer when they occur are visible over the whole hemisphere of the\r\nEarth which is turned towards the Moon whilst the area over which a\r\ntotal eclipse of the Sun is visible is but a belt of the Earth no more\r\nthan about 150 to 170 miles wide. Partial eclipses of the Sun, however,\r\nare visible over a very much wider area on either side of the path\r\ntraversed by the Moon's shadow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--THEORY OF A TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nConfining our attention in the first instance to eclipses of the Sun,\r\nthe diagrams fig. 2 and fig. 3 will make clear, with very little verbal\r\ndescription, the essential features of the two principal kinds of\r\neclipses of the Sun. In these figures S represents the Sun, M the Moon\r\nand E the Earth. They are not, of course, even approximately drawn to\r\nscale either as to the size of the bodies or their relative distances,\r\nbut this is a matter of no moment as regards the principles involved. M\r\nbeing in sunshine receives light on, as it were, the left hand side,\r\nwhich faces S the Sun. The shadow of the Moon cast into space is, in the\r\nparticular case, thrown as regards its tip on to the Earth and is\r\nintercepted by the Earth. Persons at the moment situated on the Earth\r\nwithin the limits of this shadow will not see any part of the Sun at\r\nall; they will see, in fact, nothing but the Moon as a black disc with\r\nonly such light behind and around it as may be reflected back on to the\r\nsky by the illuminated (but to the Earth invisible) hemisphere of the\r\nMoon, or as may proceed from the Sun's Corona (to be described\r\npresently). The condition of things therefore is that known as a \"total\"\r\neclipse of the Sun so far as regards the inhabitants of the narrow strip\r\nof Earth primarily affected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--THEORY OF AN ANNULAR ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nFig. 3 represents nearly but not quite the same condition of things.\r\nHere the Earth and the Moon are in those parts of their respective\r\norbits which put the two bodies at or near the maximum distance\r\npossible from the Sun and from one another. The Moon casts its usual\r\nshadow, but the tip does not actually reach any part of the Earth's\r\nsurface. Or, in other words, to an observer on the Earth the Moon is not\r\nbig enough to conceal the whole body of the Sun. The result is this; at\r\nthe instant of central coincidence the Moon covers up only the centre of\r\nthe Sun, leaving the outer edge all round uncovered.\r\n\r\nThis outer edge shows as a bright ring of light, and the eclipse is of\r\nthe sort known as an \"annular\" eclipse of the Sun.[3] As the greatest\r\nbreadth of the annulus can never exceed 1½ minutes of arc, an annular\r\neclipse may sometimes, in some part of its track, become almost or quite\r\ntotal, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--ANNULAR ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nThe idea will naturally suggest itself, what exactly does happen to the\r\ninhabitants living outside (on the one side or the other) of the strip\r\nof the Earth where the central line of shadow falls? This depends in\r\nevery case on circumstances, but it may be stated generally that the\r\ninhabitants outside the central line but within 1000 to 2000 miles on\r\neither side, will see a larger or smaller part of the Sun concealed by\r\nthe Moon's solid body, simultaneously with the total concealment of the\r\nSun to the favoured individuals who live, or who for the moment are\r\nlocated, within the limits of the central zone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--PARTIAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.]\r\n\r\nNow we must advance one stage in our conceptions of the movements of the\r\nEarth and the Moon, so far as regards the bearing of those movements on\r\nthe question of eclipses. The Earth moves in a plane which is called the\r\n\"Plane of the Ecliptic,\" and correspondingly, the Sun has an _apparent_\r\nannual motion in the same plane. The Moon moving in a different plane,\r\ninclined to the first mentioned one to the extent of rather more than\r\n5°, the Moon's orbit will evidently intersect the ecliptic in two\r\nplaces. These places of intersection are called \"Nodes,\" and the line\r\nwhich may be imagined to join these Nodes is called the \"Line of Nodes.\"\r\nWhen the Moon is crossing the ecliptic from the S. to the N. side\r\nthereof, the Moon is said to be passing through its \"Ascending Node\"\r\n([Symbol: Ascending node]); the converse of this will be the Moon\r\npassing back again from the N. side of the ecliptic to the S. side,\r\nwhich is the \"Descending Node\" ([Symbol: Descending node]). Such changes\r\nof position, with the terms designating them, apply not only to the Moon\r\nin its movement round the Earth, but to all the planets and comets\r\ncirculating round the Sun; and also to satellites circulating round\r\ncertain of the planets, but with these matters we have no concern now.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: D. Lardner, _Handbook of Astronomy_, 3rd ed., p. 288.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: But not one of them was visible at Greenwich.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: Latin _Annulus_, a ring.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n             THE \"SAROS\" AND THE PERIODICITY OF ECLIPSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo bring about an eclipse of the Sun, two things must combine: (1) the\r\nMoon must be at or near one of its Nodes; and (2), this must be at a\r\ntime when the Moon is also in \"Conjunction\" with the Sun. Now the Moon\r\nis in Conjunction with the Sun (= \"New Moon\") 12 or 13 times in a year,\r\nbut the Sun only passes through the Nodes of the Moon's orbit twice a\r\nyear. Hence an eclipse of the Sun does not and cannot occur at every New\r\nMoon, but only occasionally. An _exact_ coincidence of Earth, Moon, and\r\nSun, in a straight line at a Node is not necessary to ensure an eclipse\r\nof the Sun. So long as the Moon is within about 18½° of its Node, with a\r\nlatitude of not more than 1° 34', an eclipse _may_ take place. If,\r\nhowever, the distance is less than 15¼° and the latitude less than\r\n1° 23' an eclipse _must_ take place, though between these limits[4] the\r\noccurrence of an eclipse is uncertain and depends on what are called the\r\n\"horizontal parallaxes\" and the \"apparent semi-diameters\" of the two\r\nbodies at the moment of conjunction, in other words, on the nearness or\r\n\"far-offness\" of the bodies in question. Another complication is\r\nintroduced into these matters by reason of the fact that the Nodes of\r\nthe Moon's orbit do not occupy a fixed position, but have an annual\r\nretrograde motion of about 19¼°, in virtue of which a complete\r\nrevolution of the Nodes round the ecliptic is accomplished in 18 years\r\n218-7/8 days (= 18.5997 years).\r\n\r\nThe backward movement of the Moon's Nodes combined with the apparent\r\nmotion of the Sun in the ecliptic causes the Moon in its monthly course\r\nround the Earth to complete a revolution with respect to its Nodes in a\r\nless time (27.2 days) than it takes to get back to Conjunction with the\r\nSun (29.5 days); and a curious consequence, as we shall see directly,\r\nflows from these facts and from one other fact. The other fact is to the\r\nSun starting coincident with one of the Moon's Nodes, returns on the\r\nEcliptic to the same Node in 346.6 days. The first named period of 27.2\r\ndays is called the \"_Nodical_ Revolution of the Moon\" or \"Draconic\r\nMonth,\" the other period of 29.5 days is called the \"_Synodical_\r\nRevolution of the Moon.\" Now the curious consequence of these figures\r\nbeing what they are is that 242 Draconic Months, 223 Lunations, and 19\r\nReturns of the Sun to one and the same Node of the Moon's orbit, are all\r\naccomplished in the same time within 11 hours. Thus (ignoring\r\nrefinements of decimals):--\r\n\r\n               Days     Days.  Years.  Days.  Hours.\r\n\r\n    242 times  27.2 = 6585.36 = 18      10      8½\r\n    223 times  29.5 = 6585.32 = 18      10      7¾\r\n     19 times 346.6 = 6585.78 = 18      10     18¾\r\n\r\nThe interpretation to be put upon these coincidences is this: that\r\nsupposing Sun and Moon to start together from a Node they would, after\r\nthe lapse of 6585 days and a fraction, be found again together very near\r\nthe same Node. During the interval there would have been 223 New and\r\nFull Moons. The exact time required for 223 Lunations is such that in\r\nthe case supposed the 223rd conjunction of the two bodies would happen a\r\nlittle before they reached the Node; their distance therefrom would be\r\n28' of arc. And the final fact is that eclipses recur in almost, though\r\nnot quite, the same regular order every 6585-1/3 days, or more exactly, 18\r\nyears, 10 days, 7 hours, 42 minutes.[5] This is the celebrated Chaldean\r\n\"SAROS,\" and was used by the ancients (and can still be used by the\r\nmoderns in the way of a pastime) for the prediction of eclipses alike of\r\nthe Sun and of the Moon.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of a Saros period, starting from any date that may have been\r\nchosen, the Moon will be in the same position with respect to the Sun,\r\nnearly in the same part of the heavens, nearly in the same part of its\r\norbit, and very nearly indeed at the same distance from its Node as at\r\nthe date chosen for the _terminus a quo_ of the Saros. But there are\r\ntrifling discrepancies in the case (the difference of about 11 hours\r\nbetween 223 lunations and 19 returns of the Sun to the Moon's Node is\r\none) and these have an appreciable effect in disturbing not so much the\r\nsequence of the eclipses in the next following Saros as their magnitude\r\nand visibility at given places on the Earth's surface. Hence, a more\r\naccurate succession will be obtained by combining 3 Saros periods,\r\nmaking 54 years, 31 days; while, best of all, to secure an almost\r\nperfect repetition of a series of eclipses will be a combination of 48\r\nSaroses, making 865 years for the Moon; and of about 70 Saroses, or more\r\nthan 1200 years for the Sun.\r\n\r\nThese considerations are leading us rather too far afield. Let us return\r\nto a more simple condition of things. The practical use of the Saros in\r\nits most elementary conception is somewhat on this wise. Given 18 or 19\r\nold Almanacs ranging, say, from 1880 to 1898, how can we turn to account\r\nthe information they afford us in order to obtain from them information\r\nrespecting the eclipses which will happen between 1899 and 1917?\r\nNothing easier. Add 18^y 10^d 7^h 42^m to the middle time of every\r\neclipse which took place between 1880 and 1898 beginning, say, with the\r\nlast of 1879 or the first of 1880, and we shall find what eclipses will\r\nhappen in 1898 and 17 following years, as witness by way of example the\r\nfollowing table:--\r\n\r\n                                            Error of Saros by\r\n                             d.  h. m.

But since there is a\r\nsurplus fraction of nearly one-third of a day, each subsequent eclipse\r\nwill be visible in another region of the Earth, which will be roughly a\r\nthird of the Earth's circumference in longitude backwards (_i.e._ about\r\n120° to the W.), because the Earth itself will be turned on its axis\r\none-third forwards.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said as to the Saros and its use it might be\r\nsupposed that a correct list of eclipses for 18.03 years would suffice\r\nfor all ordinary purposes of eclipse prediction, and that the sequence\r\nof eclipses at any future time might be ascertained by adding to some\r\none eclipse which had already happened so many Saros periods as might\r\nembrace the years future whose eclipses it was desired to study. This\r\nwould be true in a sense, but would not be literally and effectively\r\ntrue, because corresponding eclipses do not recur exactly under the same\r\nconditions, for there are small residual discrepancies in the times and\r\ncircumstances affecting the real movements of the Earth and Moon and the\r\napparent movement of the Sun which, in the lapse of years and centuries,\r\naccumulate sufficiently to dislocate what otherwise would be exact\r\ncoincidences. Thus an eclipse of the Moon which in A.D. 565 was of 6\r\ndigits[7] was in 583 of 7 digits, and in 601 nearly 8. In 908 the\r\neclipse became total, and remained so for about twelve periods, or until\r\n1088. This eclipse continued to diminish until the beginning of the 15th\r\ncentury, when it disappeared in 1413. Let us take now the life of an\r\neclipse of the Sun. One appeared at the North Pole in June A.D. 1295,\r\nand showed itself more and more towards the S. at each subsequent\r\nperiod. On August 27, 1367, it made its first appearance in the North of\r\nEurope; in 1439 it was visible all over Europe; in 1601, being its 19th\r\nappearance, it was central and annular in England; on May 5, 1818, it\r\nwas visible in London, and again on May 15, 1836. Its three next\r\nappearances were on May 26, 1854, June 6, 1872, and June 17, 1890. At\r\nits 39th appearance, on August 10, 1980, the Moon's shadow will have\r\npassed the equator, and as the eclipse will take place nearly at\r\nmidnight (Greenwich M.T.), the phenomenon will be invisible in Europe,\r\nAfrica, and Asia. At every succeeding period the central line of the\r\neclipse will lie more and more to the S., until finally, on September\r\n30, 2665, which will be its 78th appearance, it will vanish at the South\r\nPole.[8]\r\n\r\nThe operation of the Saros effects which have been specified above, may\r\nbe noticed in some of the groups of eclipses which have been much in\r\nevidence (as will appear from a subsequent chapter), during the second\r\nhalf of the 19th century. The following are two noteworthy Saros groups\r\nof Solar eclipses:--\r\n\r\n    1842  July  8.    |    1850  Aug.   7.\r\n    1860   \"   18.    |    1868   \"    17.\r\n    1878   \"   29.    |    1886   \"    29.\r\n    1896  Aug.  9.    |    1904  Sept.  9.\r\n\r\nIf the curious reader will trace, by means of the _Nautical Almanac_\r\n(or some other Almanac which deals with eclipses in adequate detail),\r\nthe geographical distribution of the foregoing eclipses on the Earth's\r\nsurface, he will see that they fulfil the statement made on p. 24\r\n(_ante_), that a Saros eclipse when it reappears, does so in regions of\r\nthe Earth averaging 120° of longitude to the W. of those in which it\r\nhad, on the last preceding occasion, been seen; and also that it\r\ngradually works northwards or southwards.\r\n\r\nBut a given Saros eclipse in its successive reappearances undergoes\r\nother transformations besides that of Terrestrial longitude. These are\r\nwell set forth by Professor Newcomb[9]:--\r\n\r\n\"Since every successive recurrence of such an eclipse throws the\r\nconjunction 28' further toward the W. of the node, the conjunction must,\r\nin process of time, take place so far back from the node that no eclipse\r\nwill occur, and the series will end. For the same reason there must be a\r\ncommencement to the series, the first eclipse being E. of the node. A\r\nnew eclipse thus entering will at first be a very small one, but will be\r\nlarger at every recurrence in each Saros. If it is an eclipse of the\r\nMoon, it will be total from its 13th until its 36th recurrence. There\r\nwill be then about 13 partial eclipses, each of which will be smaller\r\nthan the last, when they will fail entirely, the conjunction taking\r\nplace so far from the node that the Moon does not touch the Earth's\r\nshadow. The whole interval of time over which a series of lunar eclipses\r\nthus extend will be about 48 periods, or 865 years. When a series of\r\nsolar eclipses begins, the penumbra of the first will just graze the\r\nearth not far from one of the poles. There will then be, on the average,\r\n11 or 12 partial eclipses of the Sun, each larger than the preceding\r\none, occurring at regular intervals of one Saros. Then the central line,\r\nwhether it be that of a total or annular eclipse, will begin to touch\r\nthe Earth, and we shall have a series of 40 or 50 central eclipses. The\r\ncentral line will strike near one pole in the first part of the series;\r\nin the equatorial regions about the middle of the series, and will leave\r\nthe Earth by the other pole at the end. Ten or twelve partial eclipses\r\nwill follow, and this particular series will cease.\"\r\n\r\nThese facts deserve to be expanded a little.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that all eclipses may be grouped in a series, and that 18\r\nyears or thereabouts is the duration of each series, or Saros cycle. But\r\nthese cycles are themselves subject to cycles, so that the Saros itself\r\npasses through a cycle of about 64 Saroses before the conditions under\r\nwhich any given start was made, come quite round again. Sixty-four times\r\n18 make 1152, so that the duration of a Solar eclipse Great Cycle may be\r\ntaken at about 1150 years. The progression of such a series across the\r\nface of the Earth is thus described by Mrs. Todd, who gives a very clear\r\naccount of the matter:--\r\n\r\n\"The advent of a slight partial eclipse near either pole of the Earth\r\nwill herald the beginning of the new series. At each succeeding return\r\nconformably to the Saros, the partial eclipse will move a little further\r\ntowards the opposite pole, its magnitude gradually increasing for about\r\n200 years, but during all this time only the lunar penumbra will impinge\r\nupon the Earth. But when the true shadow begins to touch, the\r\nobscuration will have become annular or total near the pole where it\r\nfirst appeared. The eclipse has now acquired a track, which will cross\r\nthe Earth slightly farther from that pole every time it returns, for\r\nabout 750 years. At the conclusion of this interval, the shadow path\r\nwill have reached the opposite pole; the eclipse will then become\r\npartial again, and continue to grow smaller and smaller for about 200\r\nyears additional. The series then ceases to exist, its entire duration\r\nhaving been about 1150 years. The series of \"great eclipses\" of which\r\ntwo occurred in 1865 and 1883, while others will happen in 1901, 1919,\r\n1937, 1955, and 1973, affords an excellent instance of the northward\r\nprogression of eclipse tracks; and another series, with totality nearly\r\nas great (1850, 1868, 1886, 1904, and 1922), is progressing slowly\r\nsouthwards.\"\r\n\r\nThe word \"Digit,\" formerly used in connection with eclipses, requires\r\nsome explanation. The origin of the word is obvious enough, coming as it\r\ndoes from the Latin word _Digitus_, a finger. But as human beings have\r\nonly eight fingers and two thumbs it is by no means clear how the word\r\ncame to be used for twelfths of the disc of the Sun or Moon instead of\r\ntenths. However, such was the case; and when a 16th-century astronomer\r\nspoke of an eclipse of six digits, he meant that one-half of the\r\nluminary in question, be it Sun or Moon, was covered. The earliest use\r\nof the word \"Digit\" in this connection was to refer to the twelfth part\r\nof the visible _surface_ of the Sun or Moon; but before the word went\r\nout of use, it came to be applied to twelfths of the visible _diameter_\r\nof the disc of the Sun or Moon, which was much more convenient. However,\r\nthe word is now almost obsolete in both senses, and partial eclipses,\r\nalike of the Sun and of the Moon, are defined in decimal parts of the\r\ndiameter of the luminary--tenths or hundredths according to the amount of\r\nprecision which is aimed at. Where an eclipse of the Moon is described\r\nas being of more than 12 Digits or more than 1.0 (= 1 diameter) it is to\r\nbe understood that the eclipse will be (or was) not only total, but that\r\nthe Moon will be (or was) immersed in the Earth's shadow with a more or\r\nless considerable extent of shadow encompassing it.\r\n\r\nThere are some further matters which require to be mentioned connected\r\nwith the periodicity of eclipses. To use a phrase which is often\r\nemployed, there is such a thing as an \"Eclipse Season,\" and what this is\r\ncan only be adequately comprehended by looking through a catalogue of\r\neclipses for a number of years arranged in a tabular form, and by\r\ncollating the months or groups of months in which batches of eclipses\r\noccur. This is not an obvious matter to the casual purchaser of an\r\nalmanac, who, feeling just a slight interest in the eclipses of a coming\r\nnew year, dips into his new purchase to see what those eclipses will be.\r\nA haphazard glance at the almanacs of even two or three successive years\r\nwill probably fail to bring home to him the idea that each year has its\r\nown eclipse season in which eclipses may occur, and that eclipses are\r\nnot to be looked for save at two special epochs, which last about a\r\nmonth each, and which are separated from one another and from the\r\neclipse seasons of the previous and of the following years by intervals\r\nof about six months, within a few days more or less. Such, however, is\r\nthe case. A little thought will soon make it clear why such should be\r\nthe case. We have already seen that the Moon's orbit, like that of every\r\nother planetary member of the Solar System, has two crossing places with\r\nrespect to the ecliptic which are called \"Nodes.\" We know also that the\r\napparent motion of the Sun causes that body to traverse the whole of the\r\necliptic in the course of the year. The conjoint result of all this is\r\nthat the Moon passes through a Node twice in every lunar month of 27\r\ndays, and the Sun passes (apparently) through a Node twice in every\r\nyear. The first ultimate result of these facts is that eclipses can only\r\ntake place at or near the nodal passages of the Moon and the Sun, and\r\nthat as the Sun's nodal passages are separated by six months in every\r\ncase the average interval between each set of eclipses, if there is more\r\nthan one, must in all cases be six months, more or less by a few days,\r\ndependent upon the latitude and longitude of the Moon at or about the\r\ntime of its Conjunction or Opposition under the circumstances already\r\ndetailed. If the logic of this commends itself to the reader's mind, he\r\nwill see at once why eclipses or groups of eclipses must be separated by\r\nintervals of about half an ordinary year. Hence it comes about that,\r\ntaking one year with another, it may be said that we shall always have a\r\ncouple of principal eclipses with an interval of half a year (say 183\r\ndays) between each; and that on either side of these dominant eclipses\r\nthere will, or may be, a fortnight before or a fortnight after, two\r\nother pairs of eclipses with, in occasional years, one extra thrown in.\r\nIt is in this way that we obtain what it has already been said\r\ndogmatically that we do obtain; namely, always in one year two eclipses,\r\nwhich must be both of the Sun, or any number of eclipses up to seven,\r\nwhich number will be unequally allotted to the Sun or to the Moon\r\naccording to circumstances.\r\n\r\nThough it is roughly correct to say that the two eclipse seasons of\r\nevery year run to about a month each, in length, yet it may be desirable\r\nto be a little more precise, and to say that the limits of time for\r\nsolar eclipses cover 36 days (namely 18 days before and 18 days after\r\nthe Sun's nodal passages); whilst in the case of the Moon, the limits\r\nare the lesser interval of 23 days, being 11½ on either side of the\r\nMoon's nodal passages.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen[10] that the Moon's nodes are perpetually\r\nundergoing a change of place. Were it not so, eclipses of the Sun and\r\nMoon would always happen year after year in the same pair of months for\r\nus on the Earth. But the operative effect of the shifting of the nodes\r\nis to displace backwards the eclipse seasons by about 20 days. For\r\ninstance in 1899 the eclipse seasons fall in June and December. The\r\nmiddle of the eclipse seasons for the next succeeding 20 or 30 years\r\nwill be found by taking the dates of June 8 and December 2, 1899, and\r\nworking the months backwards by the amount of 19-2/3 days for each\r\nsucceeding year. Thus the eclipse seasons in 1900 will fall in the\r\nmonths of May and November; accordingly amongst the eclipses of that\r\nyear we shall find eclipses on May 28, June 13, and November 22.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would tend to the more complete elucidation of the facts\r\nstated in the last half dozen pages, if I were to set out in a tabular\r\nform all the eclipses of a succession, say of half a Saros or 9 years,\r\nand thus exhibit by an appeal to the eye directly the grouping of\r\neclipse seasons the principles of which I have been endeavouring to\r\ndefine and explain in words.\r\n\r\n                                 Approximate\r\n                                 Mid-interval.\r\n\r\n1894.

It is not easy to explain\r\nor define in words the circumstances which control the duration of a\r\nSolar eclipse, whereas in the case of a lunar eclipse the obscuration is\r\nthe same in degree at all parts of the Earth where the Moon is visible.\r\nIn the case of a Solar eclipse it may be total, perhaps, in Africa, may\r\nbe of six digits only in Spain, and of two only in England. Under the\r\nmost favourable circumstances the breadth of the track of totality\r\nacross the Earth cannot be more than 170 miles, and it may be anything\r\nless than that down to zero where the eclipse will cease to be total at\r\nall, and will become annular. The question whether a given eclipse shall\r\nexhibit itself on its central line as a total or an annular one depends,\r\nas has been already explained, on the varying distances of the Earth and\r\nthe Moon from the Sun in different parts of their respective orbits.\r\nHence it follows that not only may an eclipse show itself for several\r\nSaros appearances as total and afterwards become annular, and _vice\r\nversâ_, but on rare occasions one and the same eclipse may be annular in\r\none part of its track across the Earth and total in another part, a\r\nshort time earlier or later. This last-named condition might arise\r\nbecause the Moon's distance from the Earth or the Sun had varied\r\nsufficiently during the progress of the eclipse to bring about such a\r\nresult; or because the shadow just reaching the Earth and no more the\r\neclipse would be total only for the moment when a view perpendicular\r\nupwards could be had of it, and would be annular for the minutes\r\npreceding and the minutes following the perpendicular glimpse obtained\r\nby observers actually on the central line. The eclipse of December 12,\r\n1890, was an instance of this.\r\n\r\nIf the paths of several central eclipses of the Sun are compared by\r\nplacing side by side a series of charts, such as those given in the\r\n_Nautical Almanac_ or in Oppolzer's _Canon_, it will be noticed that the\r\ndirection of the central line varies with the season of the year. In the\r\nmonth of March the line runs from S.W. to N.E., and in September from\r\nN.W. to S.E. In June the line is a curve, going first to the N.E. and\r\nthen to the S.E. In December the state of things is reversed, the curve\r\ngoing first to the S.E. and then to the N.E. At all places within about\r\n2000 miles of the central line the eclipse will be visible, and the\r\nnearer a place is to the central line, so much the larger will be the\r\nportion of the Sun's disc concealed from observers there by the Moon.\r\nIf the central line runs but a little to the N. of the Equator in Winter\r\nor of 25° of N. latitude in Summer, the eclipse will be visible all over\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere, and the converse will apply to the Southern\r\nHemisphere. It is something like a general rule in the case of total and\r\nannular eclipses, though subject to many modifications, that places\r\nwithin 200-250 miles of the central line will have partial eclipse of 11\r\ndigits; from thence to 500 miles of 10 digits, and so on, diminishing\r\nsomething like 1 digit for every 250 miles, so that at 2000 miles, or\r\nrather more, the Sun will be only to a very slight extent eclipsed, or\r\nwill escape eclipse altogether.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of the Sun being 866,000 miles and the Moon being only 2160\r\nmiles or 1/400th how comes it to be possible that such a tiny object\r\nshould be capable of concealing a globe 400 times bigger than itself?\r\nThe answer is--Distance. The increased distance does it. The Moon at its\r\nnormal distance from the Earth of 237,000 miles could only conceal by\r\neclipse a body of its own size or smaller, but the Sun being 93,000,000\r\nmiles away, or 392 times the distance of the Moon, the fraction 1/392\r\nrepresenting the main distance of the Moon, more than wipes out the\r\nfraction 1/400 which represents our satellite's smaller size.\r\n\r\nDuring a total eclipse of the Sun, the Moon's shadow travels across the\r\nEarth at a prodigious pace--1830 miles an hour; 30½ miles a minute; or\r\nrather more than a ½ mile a second. This great velocity is at once a\r\nclue to the fact that the total phase during an eclipse of the Sun\r\nlasts for so brief a time as a few minutes; and also to the fact that\r\nthe shadow comes and goes almost without being seen unless a very sharp\r\nwatch is kept for it. Indeed, it is only observers posted on high ground\r\nwith some miles of open low ground spread out under their eyes who have\r\nmuch chance of detecting the shadow come up, go over them, and pass\r\nforwards.\r\n\r\nPlaces at or near the Earth's equator enjoy the best opportunities for\r\nseeing total eclipses of the Sun, because whilst the Moon's shadow\r\ntravels eastwards along the Earth's surface at something like 2000 miles\r\nan hour, an observer at the equator is carried in the same direction by\r\nvirtue of the Earth's axial rotation at the rate of 1040 miles an hour.\r\nBut the speed imparted to an observer as the result of the Earth's axial\r\nrotation diminishes from the equator towards the poles where it is\r\n_nil_, so that the nearer he is to a pole the slower he goes, and\r\ntherefore the sooner will the Moon's shadow overtake and pass him, and\r\nthe less the time at his disposal for seeing the Sun hidden by the Moon.\r\n\r\nIt was calculated by Du Sèjour that the greatest possible duration of\r\nthe total phase of a Solar eclipse at the equator would be 7^m 58^s, and\r\nfor the latitude of Paris 6^m 10^s. In the case of an annular eclipse\r\nthe figures would be 12^m 24^s for the equator, and 9^m 56^s for the\r\nlatitude of Paris. These figures contemplate a combination of all the\r\nmost favourable circumstances possible; as a matter of fact, I believe\r\nthat the greatest length of total phase which has been actually known\r\nwas 6½^m and that was in the case of the eclipse of August 29, 1886. It\r\nwas in the open Atlantic that this duration occurred, but it was not\r\nobserved. The maximum observed obscuration during this eclipse was no\r\nmore than 4^m.\r\n\r\nThough total eclipses of the Sun happen with tolerable frequency so far\r\nas regards the Earth as a whole, yet they are exceedingly rare at any\r\ngiven place. Take London, for instance. From the calculations of Hind,\r\nconfirmed by Maguire,[11] it may be considered as an established fact\r\nthat there was no total eclipse visible at London between A.D. 878 and\r\n1715, an interval of 837 years. The next one visible at London, though\r\nuncertain, is also a very long way off. There will be a total eclipse on\r\nAugust 11, 1999, which will come as near to London as the Isle of Wight,\r\nbut Hind, writing in 1871, said that he doubted whether there would be\r\nany other total eclipse \"visible _in England_ for 250 years[12] from the\r\npresent time.\" Maguire states that the Sun has been eclipsed, besides\r\ntwice at London, also twice at Dublin, and no fewer than five times at\r\nEdinburgh during the 846 years examined by him. In fact that every part\r\nof the British Isles has seen a total eclipse at some time or other\r\nbetween A.D. 878 and 1724 except a small tract of country at Dingle, on\r\nthe West coast of Ireland. The longest totality was on June 15, 885,\r\nnamely, 4^m 55^s, and the shortest in July 16, 1330, namely, 0^m 56^s.\r\n\r\nContrast with this the obscure island of Blanquilla, off the northern\r\ncoast of Venezuela. The inhabitants of that island not long ago had the\r\nchoice of two total eclipses within three and a half years, namely,\r\nAugust 29, 1886, and December 22, 1889; whilst Yellowstone, U.S., had\r\ntwo in twelve years (July 29, 1878, and January 1, 1889).\r\n\r\nCounting from first to last, Du Sèjour found that at the equator an\r\neclipse of the Sun might last 4^h 29^m, and at the latitude of Paris 3^h\r\n26^m. These intervals, of course, cover all the subordinate phases. The\r\ntotal phase which alone (with perhaps a couple of minutes added) is\r\nproductive of spectacular effects, and interesting scientific results is\r\na mere matter of minutes which may be as few as one (or less), or only\r\nas many as 6 or 8.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, a summer eclipse will last longer than a winter one, because\r\nin summer the Earth (and the Moon with it), being at its maximum\r\ndistance from the Sun, the Sun will be at its minimum apparent size, and\r\ntherefore the Moon will be able to conceal it the longer.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: _Month.

This is, to watch when the Moon's black\r\nbody comes on to the Sun and goes off again, for there are no subsidiary\r\nphenomena, either interesting or uninteresting, unless, indeed, the\r\neclipse should be nearly total. The progress of astronomical science in\r\nregard to eclipses has been so extensive and remarkable of late years\r\nthat, unless the various points for consideration are kept together\r\nunder well-defined heads, it will be almost impossible either for a\r\nwriter or a reader to do full justice to the subject. Having regard to\r\nthe fact that the original conception of this volume was that it should\r\nserve as a forerunner to the total solar eclipse of May 28, 1900 (and\r\nthrough that to other total eclipses), from a popular rather than from a\r\ntechnical standpoint, I think it will be best to mention one by one the\r\nprincipal features which spectators should look out for, and to do so as\r\nnearly as may be in the order which Nature itself will observe when the\r\ntime comes.\r\n\r\nOf course the commencement of an eclipse, which is virtually the moment\r\nwhen the encroachment on the circular outline of the Sun by the Moon\r\nbegins, or can be seen, though interesting as a proof that the\r\nastronomer's prophecy is about to be fulfilled, is not a matter of any\r\nspecial importance, even in a popular sense, much less in a scientific\r\nsense. As a rule, the total phase does not become imminent, so to speak,\r\nuntil a whole hour and more has elapsed since the first contact; and\r\nthat hour will be employed by the scientific observer, less in looking\r\nat the Sun than in looking at his instruments and apparatus. He will do\r\nthis for the purpose of making quite sure that everything will be ready\r\nfor the full utilisation to the utmost extent of the precious seconds of\r\ntime into which all his delicate observations have to be squeezed during\r\nthe total phase.\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary observations I shall proceed now to break up the\r\nremainder of what I have to say respecting total eclipses into what\r\nsuggest themselves as convenient sectional heads.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE MOON'S SHADOW AND THE DARKNESS IT CAUSES.\r\n\r\nIn awaiting the darkness which is expected to manifest itself an\r\nunthinking and inexperienced observer is apt to look out for the coming\r\nobscurity, as he looks out for night-fall half an hour or more after\r\nsunset and during the evening twilight. The darkness of an eclipse is\r\nall this and something more. It is something more in two senses; for the\r\ninterval of time between the commencement of an eclipse and totality is\r\ndifferent in duration and different in quality, so to speak, from the\r\ndiminution of daylight on the Earth which ensues as the twilight of\r\nevening runs its course. Speaking roughly, sunset may be described as an\r\nalmost instantaneous loss of full sunlight; and the gradual loss of\r\ndaylight is noticeable even at such short intervals as from one five\r\nminutes to another. This is by no means the case previous to a total\r\neclipse of the Sun. When that is about to occur, the reduction of the\r\neffective sunlight is far more gradual. For instance, half an hour after\r\nan eclipse has commenced more than half the Sun's disc will still be\r\nimparting light to the Earth: but half an hour after sunset the\r\ndeficiency of daylight will be very much more marked and, if no\r\nartificial light is at hand, very much more inconvenient.\r\n\r\nIf there should be within easy reach of the observer's post a bushy\r\ntree, such for instance as an elm, 30 ft. or 40 ft. high, and spreading\r\nout sufficiently for him to place himself under it in a straight line\r\nwith the Sun, and with a nice smooth surface of ground for the sun's\r\nrays to fall on, he will see a multitude of images of the Sun thrown\r\nupon the ground.\r\n\r\nUntil the eclipse has commenced these images will be tiny circles\r\noverlapping one another, and of course each of these circles means so\r\nmany images of the Sun. These images indeed can be seen on any fine day,\r\nand the circles increase in size in proportion to the height of the\r\nfoliage above the ground, being something like 1 inch for every 10 feet.\r\nIt may be remarked, by the way, that the images are circles, because the\r\nSun is a source of light having a circular outline, and is not a point\r\nof light like a star. If it were, the outline of the foliage would be\r\nreproduced on the ground leaf for leaf. It follows naturally from all\r\nthis that when in consequence of there being an eclipse in progress the\r\nshape of the Sun's contour gradually changes, so will the shape of the\r\nSolar images on the ground change, becoming eventually so many\r\ncrescents. Moreover, the horns of the crescent-shaped images will be in\r\nthe reverse direction to the horns of the actual crescent of the Sun at\r\nthe moment, the rays of the Sun crossing as they pass through the\r\nfoliage, just as if each interstice were a lens.\r\n\r\nSupposing there are some spots on the Sun at a time when an eclipse is\r\nin progress the Moon's passage over these spots may as well be noticed.\r\nIn bygone years some amount of attention was devoted to this matter with\r\nthe view of ascertaining whether any alteration took place in the\r\nappearance of the spots; distortion, for instance, such as might be\r\nproduced by the intervention of a lunar atmosphere. No such distortion\r\nwas ever noticed, and observations with this idea in view may be said to\r\npossess now only an academic interest, for it may be regarded as a\r\nwell-established fact that the Moon has no atmosphere.\r\n\r\nDuring the passage of the Moon over Sun-spots an opportunity is afforded\r\nof comparing the blackness, or perhaps we should rather say, the\r\nintensity of the shade of a Sun-spot with the blackness of the Moon's\r\ndisc. Testimony herein is unanimous that the blackness of the Moon\r\nduring the stages of partial eclipse is intense compared with the\r\ndarkest parts of a Sun-spot; and this, be it remembered, in spite of the\r\nfact that during the partial phase the atmosphere between the observer\r\nand the Sun is brilliantly illuminated, whilst the Moon itself, being\r\nexposed to Earth-shine, is by no means absolutely devoid of all\r\nillumination.\r\n\r\nWhen the Moon is passing across the Sun there have often been noticed\r\nalong the limb of the Moon fringes of colour, and dark and bright bands.\r\nThis might not necessarily be a real appearance for it is conceivable\r\nthat such traces of colour might be due to the telescopes employed not\r\nhaving been truly achromatic, that is, not sufficiently corrected for\r\ncolour; but making every allowance for this possible source of mistake\r\nthere yet remains proof that the colour which has often been seen has\r\nbeen real.\r\n\r\nAs to whether the Moon's limb can be seen during a partial eclipse, or\r\nduring the partial phase of what is to be a total eclipse, the evidence\r\nis somewhat conflicting. There is no doubt that when the totality is\r\nclose at hand the Moon's limb can be seen projected on the Corona\r\n(presently to be described); but the question is, whether the far-off\r\nlimb of the Moon can be detected in the open sky whilst something like\r\nfull daylight still prevails on the Earth. Undoubtedly the preponderance\r\nof evidence is against the visibility of the Moon as a whole, under such\r\ncircumstances; but there is nevertheless some testimony to the contrary.\r\nA French observer, E. Liais, said that three photographic plates of the\r\neclipse of 1858 seen in S. America all showed the outer limb of the\r\nMoon with more or less distinctness. This testimony, be it noted, is\r\nphotographic and not visual; and on the whole it seems safest to say\r\nthat there is very small probability of the Moon as a whole ever being\r\nseen under the circumstances in question.\r\n\r\nWhat has just been said concerns the visibility of the Moon during quite\r\nthe early, or on the other hand during quite the late, stages of a total\r\neclipse. Immediately before or after totality the visibility of the\r\nwhole contour of the Moon is a certain fact; and the only point upon\r\nwhich there is a difference of opinion is as to what are the time-limits\r\nbeyond which the Moon must not be expected to be seen. The various\r\nrecords are exceedingly contradictory: perhaps the utmost that can be\r\nsaid is that the whole Moon must not be expected to be visible till\r\nabout 20 minutes before totality, or for more than 5 minutes after\r\ntotality--but it must be admitted that these figures are very uncertain\r\nin regard to any particular eclipse.\r\n\r\nIt has been sometimes noticed when the crescent of the Sun had become\r\ncomparatively small, say that the Sun was about 7/8ths covered, that the\r\nuncovered portion exhibited evident colour which has been variously\r\ndescribed as \"violet,\" \"brick-red,\" \"reddish,\" \"pink,\" \"orange,\"\r\n\"yellowish.\" The observations on this point are not very numerous and,\r\nas will appear from the statement just made, are not very consistent;\r\nstill it seems safe to assume that a hue, more or less reddish, does\r\noften pervade the uncovered portion of a partially-eclipsed Sun.\r\n\r\nThe remark just made as regards the Sun seems to have some application\r\nto the Moon. There are a certain number of instances on record that what\r\nis commonly spoken of as the black body of the Moon does, under certain\r\ncircumstances, display traces of red which has been variously spoken of\r\nas \"crimson,\" \"dull coppery,\" \"reddish-brownish\" and \"dull glowing\r\ncoal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SHADOW BANDS.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that we have a chance of observing a total eclipse of the\r\nSun; have completed all our preliminary preparations; have taken note of\r\neverything which needs to be noted or suggests itself for that purpose\r\nup till nearly the grand climax; and that the clock tells us that we are\r\nwithin, say, five minutes of totality. Somewhere about this time perhaps\r\nwe shall be able to detect, dancing across the landscape, singular wavy\r\nlines of light and shade. These are the \"Shadow Bands,\" as they are\r\ncalled. The phrase is curiously inexplicit, but seemingly cannot be\r\nimproved upon at present because the philosophy of these\r\nappearances--their origin and the laws which regulate their\r\nvisibility--are unknown, perhaps because amid the multitude of other\r\nthings to think about sufficient attention has hitherto not been paid to\r\nthe study of them. These shadow bands are most striking if a high\r\nplastered wall, such as the front of a stone or stuccoed house, is in\r\ntheir track as a screen to receive them. The shadow bands seem to vary\r\nboth in breadth and distance apart at different eclipses, and also in\r\nthe speed with which they pass along. Though, as already stated, little\r\nis known of their origin yet they may be conceived to be due to\r\nirregularities in the atmospheric refraction of the slender beam of\r\nlight coming from the waning or the waxing crescent of the Sun, for be\r\nit understood they may be visible after totality as well as before it.\r\nIt is to be remarked that they have never been photographed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--SHADOW BANDS.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the shadow bands there are instances on record of the\r\nlimbs of the Sun's crescent appearing to undulate violently on the\r\napproach of totality. These undulations were noticed by Airy in 1842\r\nabout 6 minutes before totality. Blake, in America in 1869, observed the\r\nsame phenomenon 8 minutes before totality. In other cases the interval\r\nwould seem to have been very much shorter--a mere matter of seconds. A\r\nvery singular observation was made in 1858 by Mr. J. D. Smith at Laycock\r\nAbbey, Wiltshire, on the occasion of the annular eclipse of that year.\r\nHe says[13]:--\"Both my brother and myself were distinctly impressed with\r\nthe conviction that the withdrawal of light was not continuous, but by\r\npulsations, or, as it were, waves of obscuration, the darkness\r\nincreasing by strokes which sensibly smote the eye, and were repeated\r\ndistinctly some five or seven times after we had remarked the phenomenon\r\nand before the time of greatest obscuration. This did not occur on the\r\nreturn of light, which came back continuously and without shock or\r\nbreak.\" Rümker mentions that though this phenomenon was very apparent to\r\nthe naked eye it was not visible in the telescope.\r\n\r\nFaint rays or brushes of light sometimes seem to spring from the\r\ndiminishing crescent of the Sun. These rays generally are very transient\r\nand not very conspicuous, and perhaps must be distinguished as regards\r\nboth their appearance and their origin from the more striking rays\r\nwhich are usually seen a few minutes before or after totality, and which\r\nare generally associated with, or even deemed to belong to, the Corona.\r\nFig. 7 represents these rays as seen in Spain on July 18, 1860, some\r\nminutes after totality. They are described as having been well defined,\r\nbut at some moments more marked than at others, and though well-defined\r\nyet constantly varying. Radiations of light more or less of the\r\ncharacter just described may probably be regarded as a standing feature\r\nof every total eclipse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--RAYS OF LIGHT SEEN NEAR THE TIME OF TOTALITY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE APPROACH OF TOTALITY.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to think about and to look out for is the approach of the\r\nMoon's shadow. I have mentioned this already,[14] and also the\r\nappalling velocity with which it seems to approach. By this time the\r\ncoming darkness, which characterises every total phase, will have\r\nreached an advanced stage of development. The darkness begins to be\r\nfelt. The events which manifest themselves at this juncture on the Earth\r\n(rather than in the sky around the Sun) are so graphically described by\r\nthe American writer whom I have already quoted, and who writes,\r\nmoreover, from personal experience, that I cannot do better than\r\ntransfer her striking account to my pages.[15] \"Then, with frightful\r\nvelocity, the actual shadow of the Moon is often seen approaching, a\r\ntangible darkness advancing almost like a wall, swift as imagination,\r\nsilent as doom. The immensity of nature never comes quite so near as\r\nthen, and strong must be the nerves not to quiver as this blue-black\r\nshadow rushes upon the spectator with incredible speed. A vast, palpable\r\npresence seems overwhelming the world. The blue sky changes to gray or\r\ndull purple, speedily becoming more dusky, and a death-like trance\r\nseizes upon everything earthly. Birds, with terrified cries, fly\r\nbewildered for a moment, and then silently seek their night-quarters.\r\nBats emerge stealthily. Sensitive flowers, the scarlet pimpernel, the\r\nAfrican mimosa, close their delicate petals, and a sense of hushed\r\nexpectancy deepens with the darkness. An assembled crowd is awed into\r\nabsolute silence almost invariably. Trivial chatter and senseless joking\r\ncease. Sometimes the shadow engulfs the observer smoothly, sometimes\r\napparently with jerks; but all the world might well be dead and cold and\r\nturned to ashes. Often the very air seems to hold its breath for\r\nsympathy; at other times a lull suddenly awakens into a strange wind,\r\nblowing with unnatural effect. Then out upon the darkness, gruesome but\r\nsublime, flashes the glory of the incomparable corona, a silvery, soft,\r\nunearthly light, with radiant streamers, stretching at times millions of\r\nuncomprehended miles into space, while the rosy, flaming protuberances\r\nskirt the black rim of the Moon in ethereal splendour. It becomes\r\ncuriously cold, dew frequently forms, and the chill is perhaps mental as\r\nwell as physical. Suddenly, instantaneous as a lightning flash, an arrow\r\nof actual sunlight strikes the landscape, and Earth comes to life again,\r\nwhile corona and protuberances melt into the returning brilliance, and\r\noccasionally the receding lunar shadow is glimpsed as it flies away with\r\nthe tremendous speed of its approach.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with the approach of the Moon's shadow, it is to be noted\r\nthat at totality the heavens appear in a certain sense to descend upon\r\nthe Earth. If an observer is looking upwards towards the zenith over his\r\nhead, he will see the clouds appear to drop towards the Earth, and the\r\nsurrounding gloom seems also to have the effect of vitiating one's\r\nestimate of distances. To an observer upon a high hill, a plain below\r\nhim appears to become more distant. Although what has been called the\r\ndescent of the clouds (that is to say their appearance of growing\r\nproximity) is most manifest immediately before the totality, yet a sense\r\nof growing nearness may sometimes be noticed a very considerable time\r\nbefore the total phase is reached.\r\n\r\nWhilst on the subject of clouds, it may be mentioned that although there\r\nis in the vault of heaven generally during the total phase an\r\nappreciable sensation of black darkness, more or less absolute, that is\r\nto say, either blackish or greyish, yet in certain regions of the sky,\r\n(generally in the direction of the horizon) the clouds, when there are\r\nany, often exhibit colours in strata, orange hue below and red above,\r\nwith indigo or grey or black higher up still, right away to the Sun's\r\nplace. The cause of these differences is to be found in the fact that\r\nthe lower part of the atmosphere within the area of the Moon's shadow\r\nis, under the circumstances in question, illuminated by light which\r\nhaving passed through many miles of atmosphere near to the Earth's\r\nsurface, has lost much from the violet end of its spectrum, leaving an\r\nundue proportion of the red end.\r\n\r\nOn certain occasions iridescent or rainbow-tinted clouds may be seen in\r\nthe vicinity of the Sun, either before, or during, or after totality,\r\ndepending on circumstances unknown. Such clouds have been observed at\r\nall these three stages of a total eclipse. The effects of course are\r\natmospheric, and have no physical connection with either Sun or Moon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE DARKNESS OF TOTALITY.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the general darkness which prevails during totality,\r\ngreat discrepancies appear in the accounts, not only as between\r\ndifferent eclipses, but in respect of the same eclipse observed by\r\ndifferent people at different places. Perhaps the commonest test applied\r\nby most observers is that of the facility or difficulty of reading the\r\nfaces of chronometers or watches. Sometimes this is done readily, at\r\nother times with difficulty. In India in 1868, one observer stated that\r\nit was impossible to recognise a person's face three yards off, and\r\nlamplight was needed for reading his chronometer. On the other hand in\r\nSpain in 1860, it was noted that a thermometer, as well as the finest\r\nhand-writing, could be read easily. The foregoing remarks apply to the\r\nstate of things in the open air. In 1860, it was stated that inside a\r\nhouse in Spain the darkness was so great that people moving about had to\r\ntake great care lest they should run violently against the household\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nPerhaps on the whole it may be said that the darkness of an ordinary\r\ntotality is decidedly greater than that of a full Moon night.\r\n\r\nMany observers have noted during totality that even when there has not\r\nbeen any very extreme amount of absolute darkness, yet the ruddy light\r\nalready mentioned as prevailing towards the horizon often gives rise to\r\nweird unearthly effects, so that the faces of bystanders assume a\r\nsickly livid hue not unlike that which results from the light of burning\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   METEOROLOGICAL AND OTHER EFFECTS.\r\n\r\nIt is very generally noticed that great changes take place in the\r\nmeteorological conditions of the atmosphere as an eclipse of the Sun\r\nruns its course from partial phase to totality, and back again to\r\npartial phase. It goes without saying that the obstruction of the solar\r\nrays by the oncoming Moon would necessarily lead to a steady and\r\nconsiderable diminution in the general temperature of the air. This has\r\noften been made the matter of exact thermometric record, but it is not\r\nequally obvious why marked changes in the wind should take place. As the\r\npartial phase proceeds it is very usual for the wind to rise or blow in\r\ngusts and to die away during totality, though there are many exceptions\r\nto this, and it can hardly be called a rule.\r\n\r\nThe depression of temperature varies very much indeed according to the\r\nlocality where the eclipse is being observed and the local thermometric\r\nconditions which usually prevail. The actual depression will often\r\namount to 10° or 20° and the deposit of dew is occasionally noticed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general effects of a total solar eclipse on men,\r\nanimals, and plants as summarised in the extract already made from Mrs.\r\nTodd's book a few additional particulars may be given culled from many\r\nrecorded observations. Flowers and leaves which ordinarily close at\r\nnight begin long before totality to show signs of closing up. Thus we\r\nare told that in 1836 \"the crocus, gentian and anemone partially closed\r\ntheir flowers and reopened them as the phenomenon passed off: and a\r\ndelicate South African mimosa which we had reared from a seed entirely\r\nfolded its pinnate leaves until the Sun was uncovered.\" In 1851 \"the\r\nnight violet, which shortly before the beginning of the eclipse had\r\nlittle of its agreeable scent about it, smelt strongly during the\r\ntotality.\"\r\n\r\nIn the insect world ants have been noticed to go on working during\r\ntotality, whilst grasshoppers are stilled by the darkness, and\r\nearth-worms come to the surface. Birds of all kinds seem always upset in\r\ntheir habits, almost invariably going to roost as the darkness becomes\r\nintensified before totality. In 1868 \"a small cock which had beforehand\r\nbeen actively employed in grubbing about in the sand went to sleep with\r\nhis head under his wing and slept for about 10 minutes, and on waking\r\nuttered an expression of surprise, but did not crow.\" In 1869 mention is\r\nmade of an unruly cow \"accustomed to jump into a corn-field at night\"\r\nbeing found to have trespassed into the said corn-field during the total\r\nphase.\r\n\r\nThe thrilling descriptions of the effects of the oncoming darkness of\r\ntotality, derived from the records of past total eclipses, are not\r\nlikely to be improved upon in the future, for we shall receive them more\r\nand more from amateurs and less and less from astronomical experts.\r\nEvery additional total eclipse which happens testifies to the fact that\r\nthe time and thoughts of these latter classes of people will be to an\r\nincreasing degree dedicated to instrumental work rather than to simple\r\nnaked eye or even telescopic observation. The spectroscope and the\r\ncamera are steadily ousting the simple telescope of every sort and\r\nunassisted eye observations from solar eclipse work.\r\n\r\nMrs. Todd has the following apt remarks by way of summary of the results\r\nto an individual of observing a total eclipse of the Sun:--\"I doubt if\r\nthe effect of witnessing a total eclipse ever quite passes away. The\r\nimpression is singularly vivid and quieting for days, and can never be\r\nwholly lost. A startling nearness to the gigantic forces of Nature and\r\ntheir inconceivable operation seems to have been established.\r\nPersonalities and towns and cities, and hates and jealousies, and even\r\nmundane hopes, grow very small and very far away.\"\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: _Month.

The appearance of the brushes will be\r\nsufficiently realised by an inspection of the annexed engraving without\r\nthe necessity of any further verbal description. These brushes are\r\nlittle, if at all, coloured, and must not be confused with the \"Red\r\nFlames\" or \"Prominences\" hereafter to be described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BAILY'S BEADS.\r\n\r\nWhen the disc of the Moon has advanced so much over that of the Sun as\r\nto have reduced the Sun almost to the narrowest possible crescent of\r\nlight, it is generally noticed that at a certain stage the crescent\r\nsuddenly breaks up into a succession of spots of light. These spots are\r\nsometimes spoken of as \"rounded\" spots, but it is very doubtful whether\r\n(certainly in view of their supposed cause) they could possibly be\r\ndeemed ever to possess an outline, which by any stretch, could be called\r\n\"rounded.\" Collating the recorded descriptions, some such phrase as\r\n\"shapeless beads\" of light would seem to be the most suitable\r\ndesignation. These are observed to form before the total phase, and\r\noften also after the total phase has passed. Under the latter\r\ncircumstances, the beads of light eventually run one into another, like\r\nso many small drops of water merging into one big one. The commonly\r\nreceived explanation of \"Baily's Beads\" is that they are no more than\r\nportions of the Sun's disc, seen through valleys between mountains of\r\nthe Moon, the said mountains being the cause why the bright patches are\r\ndiscontinuous. It is exceedingly doubtful whether this is the true\r\nexplanation. The whole question is involved in great uncertainty, and\r\nwell deserves careful study during future eclipses; but this it is not\r\nlikely to get, in view of the current fashion of every sufficiently\r\nskilled observer concentrating his attention on matters connected with\r\nthe solar Corona (observed spectroscopically or otherwise), to the\r\nexclusion of what may be called older subjects of study. I will dismiss\r\nBaily's Beads from our consideration with the remark that the first\r\nphotograph of them was obtained at Ottumwa, Illinois, U.S., during the\r\neclipse of 1869.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--\"BAILY'S BEADS,\" FOUR STAGES, AT BRIEF INTERVALS.\r\nMAY 15, 1836.]\r\n\r\n\"Baily's Beads\" received their name from Mr. Francis Baily, who, in\r\n1836, for the first time exhaustively described them; but they were\r\nprobably seen and even mentioned long before his time. At the total\r\neclipse of the Sun, seen at Penobscot in North America, on October 27,\r\n1780, they would seem to have been noticed, and perhaps even earlier\r\nthan that date.\r\n\r\nAlmost coincident with the appearance of Baily's Beads, that is, either\r\njust before or just after, and also just before or just after the\r\nabsolute totality (there seems no certain rule of time) jets of red\r\nflame are seen to dart out from behind the disc of the Moon. It is now\r\nquite recognised as a certain fact that these \"Red Flames\" belong to the\r\nSun and are outbursts of hydrogen gas. Moreover, they are now commonly\r\ncalled \"Prominences,\" and with the improved methods of modern science\r\nmay be seen almost at any time when the Sun is suitably approached; and\r\nthey are not restricted in their appearance to the time when the Sun is\r\ntotally eclipsed as was long supposed.\r\n\r\nI may have more to say about these Red Flames later on; but am at\r\npresent dealing only with the outward appearances of things.\r\nCarrington's description has been considered very apt. One which he saw\r\nin 1851 he likened to \"a mighty flame bursting through the roof of a\r\nhouse and blown by a strong wind.\"\r\n\r\nCertain ambiguous phrases made use of in connection with eclipses of\r\nancient date may perhaps in reality have been allusions to the Red\r\nFlames; otherwise the first account of them given with anything like\r\nscientific precision seems to be due to a Captain Stannyan, who observed\r\nthem at Berne during the eclipse of 1706. His words are that the Sun at\r\n\"his getting out of his eclipse was preceded by a blood-red streak from\r\nits left limb which continued not longer than six or seven seconds of\r\ntime; then part of the Sun's disc appeared all of a sudden.\"\r\n\r\nSome subsequent observers spoke of the Red Flames as isolated jets of\r\nred light appearing here and there; whilst others seem to have thought\r\nthey had seen an almost or quite continuous ring of red light around the\r\nSun. The last-named idea is now recognised as the more accurate\r\nrepresentation of the actual facts, the Red Flames being emanations\r\nproceeding from a sort of shell enveloping the Sun, to which shell the\r\nname of \"Chromosphere\" has now come to be applied.\r\n\r\nAs regards the Moon itself during the continuance of the total phase,\r\nall that need be said is that our satellite usually exhibits a disc\r\nwhich is simply black; but on occasions observers have called it purple\r\nor purplish. Although during totality the Moon is illuminated by a full\r\nallowance of Earth-shine (light reflected by the Earth into space), yet\r\nfrom all accounts this is always insufficient to reveal any traces of\r\nthe irregularities of mountains and valleys, etc., which exist on the\r\nMoon.\r\n\r\nWhen during totality any of the brighter planets, such as Mercury,\r\nVenus, Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn, happen to be in the vicinity of the Sun\r\nthey are generally recognised; but the stars seen are usually very few,\r\nand they are only very bright ones of the 1st or 2nd magnitudes. Perhaps\r\nan explanation of the paucity of stars noticed is to be found in the\r\nfact that the minds of observers are usually too much concentrated on\r\nthe Sun and Moon for any thought to be given to other things or other\r\nparts of the sky.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is a convenient place in which to recall the fact that\r\nthere has been much controversy in the astronomical world during the\r\nlast 50 years as to whether there exist any undiscovered planets\r\nrevolving round the Sun within the orbit of Mercury. Whilst there is\r\nsome evidence, though slight, that one or more such planets have been\r\nseen, opponents of the idea base their scepticism on the fact that with\r\nso many total eclipses as there have been since 1859 (when Lescarbault\r\nclaimed to have found a planet which has been called \"Vulcan\"), no\r\ncertain proof has been obtained of the existence of such a planet; and\r\nwhat better occasion for finding one (if one exists of any size) than\r\nthe darkness of a total solar eclipse? At present it must be confessed\r\nthat the sceptics have the best of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE CORONA.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider what I have already called the central feature\r\nof every total eclipse. It was long ago compared to the nimbus often\r\nplaced by painters around the heads of the Virgin Mary and other saints\r\nof old; and as conveying a rough general idea the comparison may still\r\nstand. It has been suggested that not a bad idea of it may be obtained\r\nby looking at a Full Moon through a wire-gauze window-screen. The Corona\r\ncomes into view a short time (usually to be measured by seconds) before\r\nthe total extinction of the Sun's rays, lasts during totality and\r\nendures for a brief interval of seconds (or it might be a minute) after\r\nthe Sun has reappeared. It was long a matter of discussion whether the\r\nCorona belonged to the Sun or the Moon. In the early days of telescopic\r\nastronomy there was something to be said perhaps on both sides, but it\r\nis now a matter of absolute certainty that it belongs to the Sun, and\r\nthat the Moon contributes nothing to the spectacle of a total eclipse of\r\nthe Sun, except its own solid body, which blocks out the Sun's light,\r\nand its shadow, which passes across the Earth.\r\n\r\nOf the general appearance of the Corona some idea may be obtained from\r\nFig. 1 (see Frontispiece) which so far as it goes needs little or no\r\nverbal description. Stress must however be laid on the word \"general\"\r\nbecause every Corona may be said to differ from its immediate\r\npredecessor and successor, although, as we shall see presently, there\r\nis strong reason to believe that there is a periodicity in connection\r\nwith Coronas as with so many other things in the world of Astronomy. A\r\ncurious point may here be mentioned as apparently well established,\r\nnamely, that when long rays are noticed in the Corona they do not seem\r\nto radiate from the Sun's centre as the short rays more or less seem to\r\ndo. Though the aggregate brilliancy of the Corona varies somewhat yet it\r\nmay be taken to be much about equal on the whole to the Moon at its\r\nfull. The Corona is quite unlike the Moon as regards heat for its\r\nradiant heat has been found to be very well marked.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing connected with the Sun's Corona which needs to be\r\nmentioned at the outset and which also furnishes a reason for treating\r\nit in a somewhat special manner. The usual practice in writing about\r\nscience is to deal with it in the first instance descriptively, and then\r\nif any historical information is to be given to exhibit that separately\r\nand subsequently. But our knowledge of the Sun's Corona has developed so\r\nentirely by steps from a small beginning that it is neither easy nor\r\nadvantageous to keep the history separate or in the background and I\r\nshall therefore not attempt to do so.\r\n\r\nAstronomers are not agreed as to what is the first record of the Corona.\r\nIt is commonly associated with a total eclipse which occurred in the 1st\r\ncentury A.D. and possibly in the year 96 A.D. Some details of the\r\ndiscussion will be found in a later chapter,[17] and I will make no\r\nfurther allusion to the matter here. Passing over the eclipses of 968\r\nA.D. and 1030 A.D. the records of both of which possibly imply that the\r\nCorona was noticed, we may find ourselves on thoroughly firm ground in\r\nconsidering the eclipse of April 9, 1567. Clavius, a well-known writer\r\non chronology, undoubtedly saw then the Corona in the modern acceptation\r\nof the word but thought it merely the uncovered rim of the Sun. In reply\r\nto this Kepler showed by some computations of his own, based on the\r\nrelative apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon, that Clavius's theory was\r\nuntenable. Kepler, however, put forth a theory of his own which was no\r\nbetter, namely, that the Corona was due to the existence of an\r\natmosphere round the Moon and proved its existence. From this time\r\nforwards we have statements, by various observers, applying to various\r\neclipses, of the Corona seeming to be endued with a rotatory motion. The\r\nSpanish observer, Don A. Ulloa, in 1778, wrote thus respecting the\r\nCorona seen in that year:--\"After the immersion we began to observe round\r\nthe Moon a very brilliant circle of light which seemed to have a rapid\r\ncircular motion something similar to that of a rocket turning about its\r\ncentre.\" Modern observations furnish no counterpart of these ideas of\r\nmotion in the Corona. Passing over many intervening eclipses we must\r\nnote that of 1836 (which gave us \"Baily's Beads\") as the first which set\r\nmen thinking that total eclipses of the Sun exhibited subsidiary\r\nphenomena deserving of careful and patient attention. Such attention\r\nwas given on the occasion of the eclipses of 1842 and 1851, still\r\nhowever without the Corona attracting that interest which it has gained\r\nfor itself more recently. It was noticed indeed that the Corona always\r\nfirst showed itself on the side of the Moon farthest from the vanishing\r\ncrescent but the full significance of this fact was not at first\r\nrealised. Mrs. Todd well remarks:--\"In the early observations of the\r\nCorona it was regarded as a halo merely and so drawn. Its real structure\r\nwas neither known, depicted, nor investigated. The earliest pictures all\r\nshow this. Preconceived ideas prejudiced the observers, and their\r\nsketches were mostly structureless.... It should not be forgotten that\r\nthe Coronal rays project outward into space from a spherical Sun and do\r\nnot lie in a plane as they appear to the eye in photographs and\r\ndrawings.\" After remarking on the value of photographs of the Corona up\r\nto a certain point because of their automatic accuracy Mrs. Todd very\r\nsensibly says, \"but pencil drawings, while ordinarily less trustworthy\r\nbecause involving the uncertain element of personal equation are more\r\nvaluable in delineating the finest and faintest detail of which the\r\nsensitive plate rarely takes note; the vast array of both, however,\r\nshows marked differences in the structure and form of the Corona from\r\none eclipse to another though it has not yet revealed rapid changes\r\nduring any one observation. This last interesting feature can be studied\r\nonly by comparison of photographs near the beginning of an eclipse track\r\nand its end, two or three hours of absolute time apart.\" Concerted\r\nefforts to accomplish this were made in 1871, 1887, and 1889, but they\r\nbroke down because the weather failed at one or other end of the chain\r\nof observing stations and a succession of photographs not simultaneous\r\nbut separated by sufficient intervals of time could not be had. The\r\neclipse of 1893, however, yielded successful though negative results.\r\nPhotographs in South America compared with photographs in Africa two\r\nhours later in time disclosed no appreciable difference in the structure\r\nof the Corona and its streamers. The eclipse of May 28, 1900, will\r\nfurnish the next favourable opportunity for a repetition of this\r\nexperiment by reason of the fact that the line of totality begins in\r\nNorth America, crosses Portugal and Spain and ceases in Africa. In other\r\nwords, traverses countries eminently calculated to facilitate the\r\nestablishment of photographic observing stations where observations can\r\nbe made not simultaneously but at successive intervals spread over\r\nseveral hours.\r\n\r\nAlthough of course the Corona had been observed long before the year\r\n1851, as indeed we have already seen, yet the eclipse of 1851 is the\r\nfarthest back which we can safely take as a starting-point for gathering\r\nup thoroughly precise details, because it was the first at which\r\nphotography was brought into use. Starting, therefore, with that eclipse\r\nI want to lay before the reader some of the very interesting and\r\nremarkable generalisations which (thanks especially to Mr. W. H.\r\nWesley's skilful review of many of the photographic results) are now\r\ngradually unfolding themselves to astronomers. To put the matter in the\r\nfewest possible words there seems little or no doubt that according as\r\nspots on the Sun are abundant or scarce so the Corona when visible\r\nduring an eclipse varies in appearance from one period of _eleven_ years\r\nto another like period. Or, to put it in another way, given the date of\r\na coming total eclipse we can predict to a certain extent the probable\r\nshape and character of the Corona if we know how the forthcoming date\r\nstands as regards a Sun-spot maximum or minimum.\r\n\r\nThe most recent important eclipses up to date which have been observed,\r\nnamely those of April 16, 1893, Aug. 9, 1896, and Jan. 21, 1898, do not\r\nadd much to our useful records of the outward appearances presented by\r\nthe Corona. The 1896 Corona is described as intermediate between the two\r\nTypes respectively associated with years of maximum and minimum\r\nSun-spots, and this is as it should have been, albeit there was one\r\nextension which reached to about two diameters of the Sun. The 1898\r\nCorona yielded four long Coronal streamers reaching much farther from\r\nthe Sun than any previously seen, the two longest reaching to 4½ and 6\r\ndiameters of the Sun respectively. These dimensions are quite\r\nunprecedented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--CORONA OF 1882. (SUN-SPOT MAXIMUM.)]\r\n\r\nThe application of the spectroscope to observations of eclipses of the\r\nSun demands a few words of notice in this place, but it would not be\r\nconsistent with the plan of this work to go into details. Though the\r\nspectroscope has been applied under many different circumstances to\r\ndifferent parts of the Sun's surroundings in connection with total\r\neclipses yet it is in regard to the Corona that most has been done and\r\nmost has been discovered. The substance of the discoveries made is that\r\nthe Corona shines with an intrinsic light of its own, that is to say,\r\nthat it is composed of constituents whose temperature is sufficiently\r\nelevated to be self-luminous. These constituents are chiefly hydrogen;\r\nthe body which corresponds to the line D3 (of Fraunhofer's scale), and\r\nwhich has been named \"Helium\"; and the body which corresponds to the\r\nbright green line 1474 of Kirchoff's scale and which, since its\r\nexistence was first suspected and then assured, has been named\r\n\"Coronium.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will not be surprised to learn, from what has gone before,\r\nthat an immense mass of records have accumulated respecting the\r\nappearance of the Corona. Correspondingly numerous and divergent are the\r\ntheories which have been launched to explain the observations made. One\r\nthing is in the highest degree probable, namely, that electricity is\r\nlargely concerned.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the question of Sun-spots regarded in their possible or\r\nprobable association with the Corona, the present position of matters\r\nappears to be this: that there is a real connection between the general\r\nform of the Corona and disturbances on the Sun, taking Sun-spots as an\r\nindication of solar activity. When Sun-spots are at or near their\r\nmaximum, the Corona has generally been somewhat symmetrical, with\r\nsynclinal groups of rays making angles of 45° with its general axis. On\r\nthe other hand, at the epochs of minimum Sun-spots, the Corona shows\r\npolar rifts much more widely open, with synclinal zones making larger\r\nangles with the axis, and being, therefore, more depressed towards the\r\nequatorial regions, in which, moreover, there is usually a very marked\r\nextension of Coronal matter in the form of elongated streamers reaching\r\nto several diameters of the Sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--CORONA OF 1867. (SUN-SPOT MINIMUM.)]\r\n\r\nThis generalisation is well borne out by the maximum-epoch Coronas of\r\n1870 and 1871, and the minimum-epoch Coronas of 1867, 1874, 1875, 1878,\r\nand perhaps 1887, and certainly 1889. On the other hand, the eclipses of\r\n1883, 1885 and 1886 do not strikingly confirm this theory. The eclipse\r\nof 1883 was at a time of rapidly decreasing solar activity, yet the\r\nCorona had the features of a Sun-spot maximum. The same, though in a\r\nsomewhat less degree, may be said of the eclipses of 1885 and 1886. At\r\nthe times of both of these eclipses the solar activity was decreasing.\r\n\r\nThe forthcoming eclipse of 1900 will nearly coincide with a Sun-spot\r\nminimum, and if the above conclusions are well founded the Corona in\r\n1900 should resemble that of 1889, and be characterised by, amongst\r\nother things, some very elongated groups of rays extending in nearly\r\nopposite directions.\r\n\r\nWe are still a long way off from being able to state with perfect\r\nconfidence what the Corona is. It is certainly a complex phenomenon, and\r\nthe various streamers which we see are not, as was at one time imagined,\r\na simple manifestation of one radiant light. Mrs. Todd thus conveniently\r\nsummarises the present state of our knowledge:--\"The true corona appears\r\nto be a triple phenomenon. First, there are the polar rays, nearly\r\nstraight throughout their visible extent. Gradually, as these rays start\r\nout from points on the solar disc farther and farther removed from the\r\npoles, they acquire increasing curvature, and very probably extend into\r\nthe equatorial regions, but are with great difficulty traceable there,\r\nbecause projected upon and confused with the filaments having their\r\norigin remote from the poles. Then there is the inner equatorial corona,\r\napparently connected intimately with truly solar phenomena, quite like\r\nthe polar rays; while the third element in the composite is the outer\r\nequatorial corona, made up of the long ecliptic streamers, for the most\r\npart visible only to the naked eye, also existing as a solar appendage,\r\nand possibly merging into the zodiacal light. The total eclipses of a\r\nhalf century have cleared up a few obscurities, and added many\r\nperplexities. There is little or no doubt about the substantial, if not\r\nentire, reality of the corona as a truly solar phenomenon. The Moon, if\r\nit has anything at all to do with the corona, aside from the fact of its\r\ncoming in conveniently between Sun and Earth, so as to allow a brief\r\nglimpse of something startlingly beautiful which otherwise could never\r\nhave been known, is probably responsible for only a very narrow ring of\r\nthe inner radiance of pretty even breadth all round. This diffraction\r\neffect is accepted; but the problem still remains how wide this annulus\r\nmay be, and whether it may vary in width from one eclipse to another.\r\nThese questions once settled, the spurious structure may then be\r\nexcerpted from the true. Indeed the coronal streamers, delicately\r\ncurving and interlacing, may tell the whole story of the Sun's radiant\r\nenergy.\"\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 16: There seems sufficient evidence to show that the\r\n    Corona may be seen even on occasions when the Sun is not totally\r\n    eclipsed, provided that the visible crescent of the Sun is\r\n    exceedingly narrow.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: See p. 130 (_post_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                WHAT IS OBSERVED AFTER THE TOTAL PHASE\r\n                OF AN ECLIPSE OF THE SUN IS AT AN END.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a certain sense, a description of the incidents which precede the\r\ntotal disappearance of the Sun in connection with a total Eclipse will\r\napply more or less to the second half of the phenomenon; only, of\r\ncourse, in the reverse order and on the opposite side of the compass.\r\nThe Corona having appeared first of all on the W. side of the Sun, then\r\nhaving shown itself complete as surrounding the Sun, will begin to\r\ndisappear on the W. side, and will be last seen on the E. side. Baily's\r\nBeads may or may not come into view; the Sun will reappear first as a\r\nvery thin crescent, gradually widening; the quasi-nocturnal darkness\r\nvisible on the Earth will cease, and eventually the Moon will completely\r\npass away from off the Sun, and the Sun once again will exhibit a\r\nperfect circle of light.\r\n\r\nWhilst there is so much to look for and look at and think about, one\r\nthing must be sought for instantly after totality, or it will be gone\r\nfor ever, and that is the Moon's shadow on the Earth. We have already\r\nseen in the last chapter the startling rapidity and solemnity with\r\nwhich the shadow seems to rush forward to the observer from the horizon\r\non the western side of the Meridian. Passing over him, or even, so to\r\nspeak, through him, it travels onwards in an easterly direction and very\r\nsoon vanishes. Its visibility at all depends a good deal upon whether\r\nthe observer, who is looking for it, is sufficiently raised above the\r\nadjacent country to be able to command at least a mile or two of ground.\r\nIf he is in a hollow, he will have but little chance of seeing the\r\nshadow at all: on the other hand, if he is on the top of a considerable\r\nhill (or high up on the side of a hill), commanding the horizon for a\r\ndistance of 10 or 20 miles, he will have a fair chance of seeing the\r\nshadow. Sir G. B. Airy states, in 1851, \"My eye was caught by a\r\nduskiness in the S.E., and I immediately perceived that it was the\r\nEclipse-shadow in the air, travelling away in the direction of the\r\nshadow's path. For at least six seconds, this shadow remained in sight,\r\nfar more conspicuous to the eye than I had anticipated. I was once\r\ncaught in a very violent hail and thunder-storm on the Table-land of the\r\nCounty of Sutherland called the \"Moin,\" and I at length saw the storm\r\ntravel away over the North Sea; and this view of the receding\r\nEclipse-shadow, though by no means so dark, reminded me strongly of the\r\nreceding storm. In ten or twelve seconds all appearance of the shadow\r\nhad passed away.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this may be a convenient place to make a note of what seems to\r\nbe a fact, partly established at any rate, even if not wholly\r\nestablished, namely--that there seems some connection between eclipses\r\nof the Sun and Earthquakes. A German physicist named Ginzel[18] has\r\nfound a score of coincidences between solar eclipses and earthquakes in\r\nCalifornia in the years between 1850 and 1888 inclusive. Of course there\r\nwere eclipses without earthquakes and earthquakes without eclipses, but\r\ntwenty coincidences in thirty-eight years seems suggestive of something.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: _Himmel und Erde_, vol. ii. pp. 255, 309; 1890.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n           ECLIPSES OF THE SUN MENTIONED IN HISTORY--CHINESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the first of several chapters which will be devoted to\r\nhistorical eclipses. Of course the total eclipse of the Sun of August 9,\r\n1896, observed in Norway and elsewhere, is, in a certain sense, an\r\neclipse mentioned in history, but that is not what is intended by the\r\ntitle prefixed to these chapters. By the term \"historical eclipses,\" as\r\nused here, I mean eclipses which have been recorded by ancient\r\nhistorians and chroniclers who were not necessarily astronomers, and who\r\nwrote before the invention of the telescope. The date of this may be\r\nconveniently taken as a dividing line, so that I shall deal chiefly with\r\neclipses which occurred before, say, the year 1600. There is another\r\nreason why some such date as this is a suitable one from which to take a\r\nnew departure. Without at all avowing that superstition ceased on the\r\nEarth in the year 1600 (for there is far too large a residuum still\r\navailable now, 300 years later), it may yet be said that the Revival of\r\nLetters did do a good deal to divest celestial phenomena of those\r\nalarming and panic-causing attributes which undoubtedly attached to them\r\nduring the earlier ages of the world and during the \"Dark Ages\" in\r\nWestern Europe quite as much as during any other period of the world's\r\nhistory. No one can examine the writings of the ancient Greek and Roman\r\nhistorians, and the chronicles kept in the monasteries of Western Europe\r\nby their monkish occupiers, without being struck by the influence of\r\nterror which such events as eclipses of the Sun and Moon and such\r\ncelestial visitors as Comets and Shooting Stars exercised far and wide.\r\nAnd this influence overspread, not only the unlettered lower orders, but\r\nmany of those in far higher stations of life who, one might have hoped,\r\nwould have been exempt from such feelings of mental distress as they\r\noften exhibited. Illustrations of this fact will be adduced in due\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nIt has always been supposed that the earliest recorded eclipse of the\r\nSun is one thus mentioned in an ancient Chinese classic--the _Chou-King_\r\n(sometimes spelt _Shou-Ching_). The actual words used may be\r\ntranslated:--\"On the first day of the last month of Autumn the Sun and\r\nMoon did not meet harmoniously in Fang.\" To say the least of it, this is\r\na moderately ambiguous announcement, and Chinese scholars, both\r\nastronomers and non-astronomers, have spent a good deal of time in\r\nexamining the various eclipses which might be thought to be represented\r\nby the inharmonious meeting of the Sun and the Moon as above recorded.\r\nTo cut a long story short, it is generally agreed that we are here\r\nconsidering one or other of two eclipses of the Sun which occurred in\r\nthe years 2136 or 2128 B.C. respectively, the Sun being then in the\r\nsidereal division \"Fang,\" a locality determined by the stars [Greek:\r\nbeta], [Greek: delta], [Greek: pi], and [Greek: rho]Scorpii, and which\r\nincludes a few small stars in Libra and Ophiuchus to the N. and in Lupus\r\nto the S. How this simple and neat conclusion, which I have stated with\r\nsuch apparent dogmatism, was arrived at is quite another question, and\r\nit would hardly be consistent with the purpose of this volume to attempt\r\nto work it out in detail, but a few points presented in a summary form\r\nmay be interesting.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, be it understood, that though it is fashionable to\r\ncast ridicule on John Chinaman, especially by way of retaliation for his\r\ncalling us \"Barbarians,\" yet it is a sure and certain fact that not only\r\nhave the Chinese during many centuries been very attentive students of\r\nAstronomy, but that we Westerns owe a good deal of our present knowledge\r\nin certain departments to the information stored up by Chinese observers\r\nduring many centuries both before and after the Christian Era.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a digression. The circumstances of this eclipse as\r\nregards its identification having been carefully examined by Mr. R. W.\r\nRothman,[19] in 1839 were further reviewed by Professor S. M. Russell\r\nin a paper published in the proceedings of the Pekin Oriental\r\nSociety.[20] The substance of the case is that in the reign of\r\nChung-K'ang, the fourth Emperor of the Hsia Dynasty, there occurred an\r\neclipse of the Sun, which is interesting not only for its antiquity, but\r\nalso for the dread fate of the two Astronomers Royal of the period, who\r\nwere taken by surprise at its occurrence, and were unprepared to perform\r\nthe customary rites. These rites were the shooting of arrows and the\r\nbeating of drums, gongs, etc., with the object of delivering the Sun\r\nfrom the monster which threatened to devour it. The two astronomers by\r\nvirtue of their office should have superintended these rites. They were,\r\nhowever, drunk and incapable of performing their duties, so that great\r\nturmoil ensued, and it was considered that the land was exposed to the\r\nanger of the gods. By way of appeasing the gods, and of suitably\r\npunishing the two State officials for their neglect and personal\r\nmisconduct, they were forthwith put to death, a punishment which may be\r\nsaid to have been somewhat excessive, in view of the fact that the\r\neclipse was not a total but only a partial one. An anonymous verse\r\nruns:--\r\n\r\n    Here lie the bodies of Ho and Hi,\r\n      Whose fate though sad was visible--\r\n    Being hanged because they could not spy\r\n      Th' eclipse which was invisible.\r\n\r\nIt appears beyond all reasonable doubt that the eclipse in question\r\noccurred on October 22, 2136 B.C. The preliminary difficulties to be\r\ngot over in arriving at the date arose from the fact that there was an\r\nuncertainty of 108 years in the date when the Emperor Chung-K'ang\r\nascended the throne; and within these limits of time there were 14\r\npossible years in which an eclipse of the Sun in Fang could have\r\noccurred. Then the number was further limited by the necessity of\r\nfinding an eclipse which could have been seen at the place which was the\r\nEmperor's capital. The site of this, again, was a matter of some\r\nuncertainty. However, step by step, by a judicious process of\r\nexhaustion, the year 2136 B.C. was arrived at as the alternative to the\r\npreviously received date of 2128 B.C. Considering that we are dealing\r\nwith a matter which happened full 4000 years ago, it may fairly be said\r\nthat this discrepancy is not perhaps much to be wondered at, seeing what\r\ndisputes often happen nowadays as to the precise date of events which\r\nmay have occurred but a few years or even a few months before the\r\ncontroversy springs up.\r\n\r\nProfessor Russell says that:--\"Some admirers of the Chinese cite this\r\neclipse as a proof of the early proficiency attained by the Chinese in\r\nastronomical calculations. I find no ground for that belief in the text.\r\nIndeed, for many centuries later, the Chinese were unable to predict the\r\nposition of the Sun accurately among the stars. They relied wholly on\r\nobservation to settle their calendar, year by year, and seem to have\r\ndrawn no conclusions or deductions from their observations. Their\r\ncalendar was continually falling into confusion. Even at the beginning\r\nof this dynasty, when the Jesuits came to China, the Chinese\r\nastronomers were unable to calculate accurately the length of the shadow\r\nof the Sun at the equinoxes and solstices. It seems to me therefore very\r\nimprobable that they could have been able to calculate and predict\r\neclipses.\"\r\n\r\nI am not at all sure that this is quite a fair presentation of the case.\r\nI do not remember ever to have seen the power to predict eclipses\r\nascribed to the Chinese, but it is a simple matter of fact that we owe\r\nto them during many centuries unique records of a vast number of\r\ncelestial phenomena. Their observations of comets may be singled out as\r\nhaving been of inestimable value to various 19th-century computers,\r\nespecially E. Biot and J. R. Hind.\r\n\r\nThe second recorded eclipse of the Sun would seem to be also due to the\r\nChinese. Confucius relates that during the reign of the Emperor Yew-Wang\r\nan eclipse took place. This Emperor reigned between 781 B.C. and 771\r\nB.C., and it has been generally thought that the eclipse of 775 B.C. is\r\nthe one referred to, but Johnson doubts this on the ground that this\r\neclipse was chiefly visible in the circumpolar regions, and if seen at\r\nall in China must have been of very small dimensions. He leans to the\r\neclipse of June 4, 780 B.C. as the only large one which happened within\r\nthe limits of time stated above.\r\n\r\nAn ancient Chinese historical work, known as the _Chun-Tsew_, written by\r\nConfucius, makes mention of a large number of solar eclipses which\r\noccurred before the Christian Era. This work came under the notice of M.\r\nGaubil, one of the French Jesuit missionaries who laboured in China\r\nsome century and a half ago, and he first gave an account of it in his\r\n_Traité de la Chronologie Chinoise_, published at Paris in 1770.[21]\r\n\r\nThe _Chun-Tsew_ is said to be the only work really written by\r\nKung-Foo-Tze, commonly known as Confucius, the other treatises\r\nattributed to him having been compiled by disciples of his either during\r\nhis life-time or after his decease. The German chronologist, Ideler, was\r\nacquainted with this work, and in a paper of his own, presented to the\r\nBerlin Academy, remarked:--\"What gives great interest to this work is the\r\naccount of 36 solar eclipses observed in China, the first of which was\r\non Feb. 22, 720 B.C., and the last on July 22, 495 B.C.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Mr. John Williams, then Assistant Secretary of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society, communicated to the Society in a condensed form\r\nthe particulars of these eclipses as related in Confucius's book,\r\ntogether with some remarks on the book itself. The _Chun-Tsew_ treats of\r\na part of the history of the confederated nations into which China was\r\ndivided during the Chow Dynasty, that is between 1122 B.C. and 255 B.C.\r\nThe particular period dealt with is that which extended from 722 B.C. to\r\n479 B.C. It was during the latter part of this interval of about 242\r\nyears that Confucius flourished. But the book is not quite a general\r\nhistory for it is more particularly devoted to the small State of Loo\r\nof which Confucius was a native, where he passed a great portion of his\r\nlife, and where he was advanced to the highest honours. It contains the\r\nhistory of twelve princes of this State with incidental notices of the\r\nother confederated nations. The number of the years of each reign is\r\naccurately determined, and the events are classed under the years in\r\nwhich they occurred. Each year is divided into sections according to the\r\nfour seasons, Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, and the sections are\r\nsubdivided into months, and often the days are distinguished. The name\r\n_Chun-Tsew_ is said to have been given to this work from its having been\r\ncommenced in Spring and finished in Autumn, but Williams thinks that the\r\nname rather refers to the fact that its contents are divided into\r\nseasons as stated. The style in which it is written is very concise,\r\nbeing a bare mention of facts without comment, and although on this\r\naccount it might appear to us dry and uninteresting, it is much valued\r\nby the Chinese as a model of the ancient style of writing. It forms one\r\nof the _Woo-King_ or Five Classical Books, without a thorough knowledge\r\nof which, and of the _Sze-Shoo_ or Four Books, no man can attain to any\r\npost of importance in the Chinese Empire.\r\n\r\nThe account of each eclipse is but little more than a brief mention of\r\nits occurrence at a certain time. The following is an example of the\r\nentries:--\"In the 58th year of the 32nd cycle in the 51st year of the\r\nEmperor King-Wang, of the Chow Dynasty, the 3rd year of Yin-Kung, Prince\r\nof Loo, in the spring, the second moon, on the day called Kea-Tsze,\r\nthere was an eclipse of the Sun.\" This 58th year of the 32nd cycle\r\nanswers to 720 B.C. Mr. Williams in the year 1863 presented to the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society a paper setting out the whole of the eclipses of\r\nwhich I have cited but one example, converting, of course, the very\r\ncomplicated Chinese dates into European dates.\r\n\r\nThese Chinese records of eclipses were in 1864 subjected to examination\r\nby the late Sir G. B. Airy,[22] with results which were highly\r\nnoteworthy, and justify us in reposing much confidence in Chinese\r\nastronomical work. Airy remarks:--\"The period through which these\r\neclipses extend is included in the time through which calculations of\r\neclipses have been made in the French work entitled _L'Art de vérifier\r\nles Dates_. I have several times had occasion to recalculate with great\r\naccuracy eclipses which are noted in that work (edition of 1820), and I\r\nhave found that, to the limits of accuracy to which it pretends, and\r\nwhich are abundantly sufficient for the present purpose, it is perfectly\r\ntrustworthy. I have therefore made a comparison of the _Chun-Tsew_\r\neclipses with those of _L'Art de vérifier les Dates_. The result is\r\ninteresting. Of the 36 eclipses, 32 agree with those of the _Art de\r\nvérifier les Dates_, not only in the day, but also in the general track\r\nof the eclipse as given in the _Art de vérifier_, which appears to show\r\nsufficiently that the eclipse would be visible in that province of China\r\nto which the _Chun-Tsew_ is referred.\" Airy then proceeds to point out\r\nthat, with regard to the four eclipses which he could not confirm, there\r\ncannot have been eclipses in April 645 B.C. or in June 592 B.C. It\r\nappears, however, from a note by Williams, that the date attached to the\r\neclipse of 645 B.C. is, in reality, an erroneous repetition (in the\r\nChinese mode of expressing it) of that attached to the next following\r\none, and in the absence of correct date it must be rejected. In the\r\nrecord of 592 B.C., June 16, no clerical error is found, and there must\r\nbe an error of a different class. The eclipses of 552 B.C., September\r\n19, and 549 B.C., July 18, to which there is nothing corresponding in\r\nthe _Art de vérifier_, are in a different category. These occur in the\r\nlunations immediately succeeding 552 B.C., August 20, and 549 B.C., June\r\n19, respectively, and there is no doubt that those which agree with the\r\n_Art de vérifier_ were real eclipses. Now there cannot be eclipses\r\nvisible at the same place in successive lunations, because the\r\ndifference of the Moon's longitudes is about 29°, and the difference of\r\nlatitudes is therefore nearly 3°, which is greater than the sum of the\r\ndiameters of the Sun and Moon increased by any possible change of\r\nparallax for the same place. These, therefore, were not real eclipses.\r\nIt seems probable that the nominal days were set down by the observer in\r\nhis memorandum book as days on which eclipses were to be looked for.\r\nAiry conjectured that the eclipses of 552 B.C., August 20, and 549 B.C.,\r\nJune 19, were observed by one and the same person, and that he possessed\r\nscience enough to make him connect the solar eclipses with the change\r\nof the Moon, but not enough to give him any idea of the limitations to\r\nthe visibility of an eclipse.\r\n\r\nOn a subsequent occasion Mr. Williams laid before the Society a further\r\nlist of solar eclipses observed in China, and extending from 481 B.C. to\r\nthe Christian Era. He collected these from a Chinese historical work,\r\nentitled _Tung-Keen-Kang-Muh_. This work, which runs to 101 volumes,\r\ncontains a summary of Chinese history from the earliest times to the end\r\nof the Yuen Dynasty, A.D. 1368, and was first published about 1473. The\r\ncopy in Mr. Williams's possession was published in 1808. The text is\r\nvery briefly worded, and consists merely of an account of the accessions\r\nand deaths of the emperors and of the rulers of the minor states, with\r\nsome of the more remarkable occurrences in each reign. The appointments\r\nand deaths of various eminent personages are also noticed, together with\r\nspecial calamities such as earthquakes, inundations, storms, etc. The\r\nastronomical allusions include eclipses and comets. Amongst the eclipses\r\nare also all, or most of those which are recorded in the _Chun-Tsew_ as\r\nhaving occurred prior to 479 B.C. Though no particular expressions are\r\nused to define the exact character of the eclipses, it is to be presumed\r\nthat some of them must have been total, because it is stated that the\r\nstars were visible, albeit that seemingly in only one instance is a word\r\nattached which specifically expresses the idea of totality. Here again\r\nall the dates were expressed in Chinese style, but, as published by\r\nWilliams, were rendered, as before, in European style by aid of\r\nchronological tables, published about 1860 in Japan. Mr. Williams, in\r\nhis second paper, from which I have been quoting, states that he brought\r\nhis published account down to the Christian Era only as a matter of\r\nconvenience, but that he had in hand a further selection of eclipses\r\nfrom the _Tung-Keen-Kang-Muh_, the interval from the Christian Era to\r\nthe 4th century A.D. yielding nearly 100 additional eclipses. This\r\nfurther transcript has not yet been published, but remains in MS. in the\r\nLibrary of the Royal Astronomical Society. Mr. Williams died in 1874 at\r\nthe age of 77, one of the most experienced Chinese scholars of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that none of the Chinese annals to which reference has\r\nbeen made include any mention of eclipses of the Moon; but the records\r\nof Comets are exceedingly numerous and, as I have already stated, have\r\nproved of the highest value to astronomers who have been called upon to\r\ninvestigate the ancient history of Comets.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: _Memoirs_, R.A.S., vol. xi. p. 47.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: Republished in the _Observatory_ Magazine, vol. xviii.\r\n    p. 323, _et seq._, 1895.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: A good deal of information respecting Chinese eclipse\r\n    records, so far as known up to the beginning of the 19th-century,\r\n    will be found in Delambre's _Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne_.\r\n    Paris, 1817.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: _Month.

It seems safe to assert that\r\nthere is at least one, and that there may be three or four.\r\n\r\nIn Amos viii. 9 we read:--\"I will cause the Sun to go down at noon, and I\r\nwill darken the Earth in the clear day.\" This language is so very\r\nexplicit and applies so precisely to the circumstances of a solar\r\neclipse that commentators are generally agreed that it can have but one\r\nmeaning;[23] and accordingly it is considered to refer without doubt to\r\none or other of the following eclipses:--791 B.C., 771 B.C., 770 B.C., or\r\n763 B.C. Archbishop Usher,[24] the well-known chronologist, suggested\r\nthe first three more than two centuries ago, whilst the eclipse of 763\r\nB.C. was suggested in recent times and is now generally accepted as the\r\none referred to. The circumstances connected with the discovery and\r\nidentification of the eclipse of 763 B.C. are very interesting.\r\n\r\nThe date when Amos wrote is set down in the margin of our Bibles as 787\r\nB.C. and if this date is correct it follows that for his statement to\r\nhave been a prediction he must be alluding to some eclipse of later date\r\nthan 787 B.C. This obvious assumption not only shuts out the eclipse of\r\n791 B.C., but opens the door to the acceptance of the eclipse of 763\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nApparently the first modern writer who looked into the matter after\r\nArchbishop Usher was the German commentator Hitzig who suggested the\r\neclipse of Feb. 9, 784 B.C. Dr. Pusey was so far taken with this idea\r\nthat he thought it worth while to secure the co-operation of the Rev. R.\r\nMain, F.R.A.S., the Radcliffe Observer at Oxford, for the purpose of a\r\nfull investigation. Mr. Main had the circumstances of that eclipse\r\ncalculated, with the result that though the eclipse was indeed total in\r\nAfrica and Hindostan, yet at Samaria it was only partial and of no\r\nconsiderable magnitude. Dr. Pusey's words, summing up the situation\r\nare:--\"The eclipse then would hardly have been noticeable at Samaria,\r\ncertainly very far indeed from being an eclipse of such magnitude, as\r\ncould in any degree correspond with the expression, 'I will cause the\r\nSun to go down at noon.'\" ... \"Beforehand, one should not have expected\r\nthat an eclipse of the Sun, being itself a regular natural phenomenon,\r\nand having no connection with the moral government of God, should have\r\nbeen the subject of the prophet's prediction. Still it had a religious\r\nimpressiveness then, above what it has now, on account of that\r\nwide-prevailing idolatry of the Sun. It exhibited the object of their\r\nfalse worship, shorn of its light, and passive.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Pusey's _Commentary_ from which the above quotation is made[25]\r\nbears the date 1873, but he appears not to have been acquainted with the\r\nimportant discovery announced no less than six years previously by the\r\ndistinguished Oriental scholar, Sir H. C. Rawlinson. The discovery to\r\nwhich I allude is a contemporary record on an Assyrian tablet of a solar\r\neclipse which was seen at Nineveh about 24 years after the reputed date\r\nof Amos's prophecy. This tablet had been described by Dr. Hinckes in the\r\nBritish Museum _Report_ for 1854 but its chronological importance had\r\nnot then been realised. Sir H. Rawlinson[26] speaks of the tablet as a\r\nrecord of or register of the annual archons at Nineveh. He says:--\"In the\r\neighteenth year before the accession of Tiglath-Pileser there is a\r\nnotice to the following effect--'In the month Sivan an eclipse of the Sun\r\ntook place' and to mark the great importance of the event a line is\r\ndrawn across the tablet although no interruption takes place in the\r\nofficial order of the Eponymes. Here then we have notice of a solar\r\neclipse which was visible at Nineveh which occurred within 90 days of\r\nthe (vernal) equinox (taking that as the normal commencement of the\r\nyear) and which we may presume to have been total from the prominence\r\ngiven to the record, and these are conditions which during a century\r\nbefore and after the era of Nabonassar are alone fulfilled by the\r\neclipse which took place on June 15, 763.\"\r\n\r\nThis record was submitted to Sir G. B. Airy and Mr. J. R. Hind, and the\r\ncircumstances of the eclipse were computed by the latter, by the aid of\r\nHansen's Lunar Tables and Le Verrier's Solar Tables. The result, when\r\nplotted on a map, showed that the shadow line just missed the site of\r\nNineveh, but that a very slight and unimportant deviation from the\r\nresult of the Tables would bring the shadow over the city of Nineveh\r\nwhere the eclipse was observed, and over Samaria where it was predicted.\r\nThe identification of this eclipse, both as regards its time and place,\r\nhas also proved a matter of importance in the revision of Scripture\r\nchronology, by lowering, to the extent of 25 years, the reigns of the\r\nkings of the Jewish monarchy. The need for this revision is further\r\nconfirmed, if we assume that the celebrated incident in the life of King\r\nHezekiah, described as the retrogradation of the Sun's shadow on the\r\ndial of Ahaz, is to be interpreted as connected with a partial eclipse\r\nof the Sun.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider this event, and see what can be made out of it. One\r\nScripture record (2 Kings xx. 11) is as follows:--\"And Isaiah the prophet\r\ncried unto the Lord: and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward, by\r\nwhich it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz.\" This passage has greatly\r\nexercised commentators of all creeds in different ages of the Church;\r\nand the most divergent opinions have been expressed as to what happened.\r\nThis has been due to two causes jointly. Not only is the occurrence\r\nincomprehensible, looked at on the surface of the words, but we are\r\nentirely ignorant of the construction of the so-called \"dial\" of Ahaz,\r\nand have little or no material directly available from outside sources\r\nto enable us to come to a clear and safe conclusion. No doubt, however,\r\nit was a sun-dial, or gnomon of some kind. Bishop Wordsworth lays stress\r\non the apparent assertion that the miracle was not wrought on any other\r\ndial at Jerusalem except that of Ahaz, the father of Hezekiah, and he\r\ntreats as a confirmation of this the statement in 2 Chron. xxxii. 31,\r\nthat ambassadors came from Babylon to Jerusalem, being curious to learn\r\nall about \"the wonder that had been done in the land\" (_i.e._ in the\r\nland of Judah). But there is more taken for granted here than is\r\nnecessary, or, as we shall presently see, is justifiable. To begin with,\r\nhow do we know that there was any other dial at Jerusalem like that of\r\nAhaz? But, in point of fact, we must make a new departure altogether,\r\nfor it has been suggested (I know not exactly by whom, or when for the\r\nfirst time) that an eclipse of the Sun, under certain circumstances,\r\nwould explain all that happened, and reconcile all that has to be\r\nreconciled. What happened to Hezekiah is thought by many to imply\r\nclearly a miracle, and it may be said that an eclipse of the Sun cannot\r\nbe held to be a miracle[27] by the ordinary definition of the word. But,\r\non the other hand, it certainly might count as such in the eyes of\r\nignorant spectators, who know nothing of the theory or practice of\r\neclipses, and who would regard such a thing as quite unforeseen,\r\nunexpected, and alarming. Illustrations of this might be multiplied from\r\nall parts of the world, in all ages of the world's history.\r\n\r\nLet us see now what the argument is, as it was worked out by the late\r\nMr. J. W. Bosanquet, F.R.A.S. Shortly before the invasion of Judæa by\r\nSennacherib--say in the beginning of the year 689 B.C.--Hezekiah was sick\r\nunto death. In answer to his fervent prayer for recovery the prophet\r\nIsaiah was sent to him with this message:--\"Thus saith the Lord, the God\r\nof David thy Father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears;\r\nbehold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years ... and I will defend\r\nthis city, and this shall be a sign unto thee from the Lord, that the\r\nLord will do this thing that He hath spoken. Behold, I will bring again\r\nthe shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun-dial of Ahaz\r\nten degrees backward. So the Sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees\r\nit had gone down.\" (Isaiah xxxviii. 5-8).\r\n\r\nIn these words we evidently have mention of some instrument erected in\r\nHezekiah's palace, in the days of his father Ahaz, for showing the\r\nchange in the position of the shadow cast by the Sun from day to day.\r\nThis statement is confirmed by a profane writer, Glycas, who states:\r\n\"They say that Ahaz, by some contrivance, had erected in his palace\r\ncertain steps, which showed the hours of the day, and also measured the\r\ncourse of the Sun.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea involved in \"bringing again,\" through \"ten degrees backward,\"\r\n\"the shadow of the degrees\" which had gone down, is very noteworthy. We\r\nseem intended to learn from these words several things. For one thing\r\n(to begin with) that the steps (as we must consider them to have been)\r\non this sun-dial of Ahaz, were turned away from the Sun. For only in\r\nthat position could they cast their shadow, or could the number of the\r\nilluminated steps be varied, upwards or downwards, according to the\r\nvarying altitude of the sun. The only conceivable use of a fixed\r\ninstrument so placed would be to show the rise and fall of the shadow\r\nfrom day to day, as the Sun on the meridian gradually rose higher\r\nbetween mid-winter and mid-summer, or descended lower between mid-summer\r\nand mid-winter, in passing of course through the winter and summer\r\nsolstices in turn. No simple motion of the Sun in its ordinary diurnal\r\nprogress would produce the effect described. On the other hand, it is\r\nequally clear that the shadow cast by a gnomon properly adjusted at the\r\nhead of such a series of steps would travel upwards and downwards upon\r\nthe steps \"with the Sun,\" from winter to summer and from summer to\r\nwinter, indicating at each noon the meridian altitude of the Sun from\r\nday to day, the latitude of Jerusalem being 31° 47', and the Sun's\r\naltitude there on the shortest day being 34° 41'. If the gnomon were\r\nraised above the topmost step so as to bring the tip of the gnomon or\r\nany aperture in it so much above the step as would be the equivalent of\r\n2° 54' or slightly more, then the top of the shadow of the gnomon (or a\r\nspot of light passing through a hole in it) would, on the shortest day\r\nof the year, fall just beyond the lowermost step. An instrument\r\nconstructed on the principle just set forth was known to and used by the\r\nGreek astronomers of antiquity under the name of a _Sciotheron_ or\r\nshadow-taker. Sometimes, and perhaps more properly, it was called a\r\n_Heliotropion_, that is, an instrument designed to indicate the turning\r\nof the Sun at the Tropics.[28] This, be it remembered, was information\r\nneeded by the ancients for the correct regulation of the seasons of the\r\nyear, and of special service to the Jews whose greater festivals were\r\nfixed in connection with the seasons. There is reason to believe that\r\ninstruments of this character were of early invention, going back\r\nperhaps to the times of Homer, for we find a passage in the _Odyssey_,\r\n(xv. 403) as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"Above Ortygia lies an isle of fame\r\n    Far hence remote, and Syria [Syros] is the name;\r\n    There curious eyes inscrib'd with wonder trace\r\n    The Sun's diurnal and his summer race.\"\r\n\r\nPope's rendering of this passage fails, however, to bring out the\r\nsalient idea involved. Butcher and Lang translate the passage\r\nthus:--\"There is a certain isle called Syria, if haply thou hast heard\r\ntell of it, over above Ortygia, and there are the turning-places of the\r\nSun.\" Merry[29] calls these island names mere \"inventions of the poet.\"\r\nIt seems to me a great question whether Homer's words really support the\r\nstatement I have made just before quoting it.\r\n\r\nDiogenes Laërtius refers to this same instrument when he speaks of the\r\nHeliotropion preserved in the Island of Syra.[30]\r\n\r\nAccording to Laërtius, Anaximander[31] was the first Greek to use\r\ngnomons, which he placed on the Sciothera of Lacedæmon, for the express\r\npurpose of indicating the Tropics and Equinoxes. These Sciothera were\r\npyramidal in form.\r\n\r\nAn obelisk was the simplest, though an imperfect form of Heliotropion,\r\nmarking indistinctly the length of a shadow at different times of the\r\nyear, especially the extremes of length and shortness at mid-winter and\r\nmid-summer. It is perhaps interesting to mention that travellers have\r\nrecorded, in various places, various devices for furnishing information\r\nrespecting these matters. For instance, in Milan Cathedral the meridian\r\nline is marked on the pavement, and along this line, an image of the Sun\r\ncoming through an aperture in the southern wall travels backwards and\r\nforwards during the year according to the seasons. Some Jesuit\r\nmissionaries who visited China about the middle of the last century,\r\nnoticed a device of this character in operation at the Observatory at\r\nPekin. A gnomon had been set up in a low room and one of the\r\nmissionaries, M. Le Comte, describes in the following words what they\r\nsaw in connection with this gnomon:--\"The aperture through which the rays\r\nof the Sun came was about 8 ft. above the floor; it is horizontal and\r\nformed of two pieces of copper, which may be turned so as to be farther\r\nfrom, or closer to, each other to enlarge or contract the aperture.\r\nLower was a table with a brass plate in the middle on which was traced a\r\nmeridian line 15 ft. long, divided by transverse lines which are neither\r\nfinished nor exact. All round the table there are small channels to\r\nreceive the water, whereby it is to be levelled.\"[32]\r\n\r\nAll this may seem rather a digression, and so it is, but I am following\r\nMr. Bosanquet herein in order the better to justify the argument that\r\nit was an eclipse of the Sun which marked the important incident in\r\nHezekiah's life which has been handed down to us by the sacred writer.\r\nIt is evident that if a flight of steps were erected on the principles\r\nwhich were set forth above, the steps sloping upwards and southwards\r\n(for the Northern Hemisphere) from the lowest step to within a few\r\ninches below an aperture in the gnomon suitably arranged, the ray or\r\nimage of the Sun, whichever it was, would travel day by day up and down\r\nsuch steps between solstice and solstice. We may conclude, therefore,\r\nthat the instrument which Hezekiah gazed at, and which is called in\r\nScripture, the \"Dial\" of Ahaz, was what the Greeks would have termed a\r\nHeliotropion.\r\n\r\nThe historian's record is to the effect that on the day of Hezekiah's\r\nrecovery an extraordinary motion of the shadow was observed on the\r\n\"Steps of Ahaz\" by the rising of the shadow \"ten steps\" from the point\r\nto which it had \"gone down with the Sun.\" This effect is spoken of not\r\nas a miracle but as \"a sign.\" It should also be remembered that the cure\r\nof Hezekiah was effected not by a miracle but by a simple application of\r\na lump of figs. The promise of his recovery was confirmed by the motion\r\nof the shadow as already stated. We are justified, therefore, in looking\r\nfor some ordinary natural phenomenon by which to account for this\r\npeculiar motion on the dial, and something miraculous is not essential.\r\nDean Milman once suggested that the effect might have been produced \"by\r\na cloud refracting the light.\" No doubt a dark cloud might produce an\r\napparent interference with the shadow, but it is well pointed out by\r\nBosanquet that such a cause as a cloud would have been so manifest to\r\neveryone, and the effect so transient, that the phenomenon could hardly\r\nhave been referred to afterwards as it was in another place as \"a wonder\r\nthat was done in the land.\" (2 Chron. xxxii. 31).\r\n\r\nIt becomes, therefore, alike an obvious and a simple explanation that a\r\nshadow caused by the Sun might be deflected downwards on such an\r\ninstrument with a regular and steady motion by the Moon passing slowly\r\nover the upper part of the Sun's disc, as Sun and Moon both approached\r\nthe meridian.\r\n\r\nThe critical question has now to be raised: \"Can astronomers inform us\r\nwhether a considerable eclipse of the Sun occurred at the beginning of\r\nthe year 689 B.C. anywhere near noon and which was visible at\r\nJerusalem?\" And the answer to this it is interesting to be able to say\r\nis a plain and distinct affirmative. There was a large partial eclipse\r\nof the Sun on January 11, 689 B.C., about 11.30 A.M., and it was the\r\nupper limb which underwent eclipse.\r\n\r\nThis eclipse fulfils all the requirements of the case, both from the\r\nhistorian's and the astronomer's point of view. It occurred about the\r\nyear fixed by Demetrius as that of Hezekiah's illness: it occurred while\r\nthe Sun was approaching and actually passing the meridian; the\r\nobscuration was on that part of the Sun's disc (namely the upper part)\r\nwhich would have had the effect of causing the point of light, which\r\nwould seem to emanate from the Sun, to appear to be depressed downwards;\r\nand it was visible at Jerusalem. But there still remains for\r\nconsideration the final and most important question, \"Would a deflection\r\nof light proceeding from the Sun, regarded as a moving body, be capable\r\nof affecting, to the extent of 'ten steps,' the shadow on such an\r\ninstrument as has been described?\" And arising out of this, there is the\r\nsubordinate question, \"Would January, being the month when this eclipse\r\ncertainly occurred, also be a month suitable for the exhibition of such\r\na phenomenon?\"\r\n\r\nIt is ascertainable by calculation that the time occupied by the Moon in\r\npassing over the Sun, in the way it did during this eclipse, was about\r\n2½ hours. But from the time of central conjunction, when the\r\nobscuration was the greatest and the point of light depressed the most,\r\nto the time when the uppermost portion of the Sun's disc was released by\r\nthe eastward motion of the Moon, and the light from that uppermost\r\nportion was again manifest, was about 20 minutes, and this, therefore,\r\nwas the time during which the phenomenon of retrogression on the \"steps\"\r\nwould have been exhibited to the King's eyes. Assuming then that the\r\ntime when the ascending shadow had travelled upwards to the tenth step\r\ncoincided, or nearly so, with the time when the Sun had reached its\r\nhighest altitude for the day, at noon, we infer that the time of central\r\nconjunction during this eclipse was not later than from 20 to 15\r\nminutes before noon. It could not have been much earlier, because the\r\nphenomenon of the resting of the shadow for a time at its _apparently_\r\nhighest point for the day (which preceded the promise that it should\r\nrise ten steps) has also to be accounted for, and this cessation of its\r\nmotion upwards could not have taken place till about 25 minutes before\r\nnoon, when the decreasing motion of the Sun in altitude (or its\r\nslackening motion upwards as it approached mid-day) would have become\r\ncounteracted by the coming on of the eclipse. Now at 11.35 A.M. the\r\nsun's disc would have risen to the altitude of 35° 8'; and the highest\r\nvisible point of light would, owing to the eclipse, then have been about\r\n35° 4'; and at 11.40 A.M., being the time of greatest obscuration, the\r\nextreme cusps of light produced by the intervention of the Moon would\r\nstill have stood at about 35° 4', just 23' below the highest point of\r\nlight at noon (Fig. 12). _The whole disc of the sun had now risen above\r\nthe gnomon, yet no motion of the shadow on the steps had been observed\r\nfor fully five minutes. The time shown by the dial was seemingly\r\nmid-day._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--ECLIPSE OF THE SUN, JANUARY 11, 689 B.C., AT\r\nJERUSALEM.]\r\n\r\nSun's apparent semi-diameter 16' 13\"\r\nMoon's  \"       \"            15' 13\"\r\nMoon's relative hourly motion in declination 5' 44\" northward.\r\nRight ascension, 29' 33\" eastward.\r\nCorrected for Jerusalem, 19' 42\" eastward.\r\nAltitude of the Gnomon, 34° 41' 13\".\r\n\r\nSUN'S ALTITUDE BEFORE AND AT NOON.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Phase at 20 minutes before noon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Phase at noon.]\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider \"to what extent would a staircase rising at an\r\nangle of 31° 47' towards the Sun, with a gnomon so placed at the top as\r\nto cast a shadow to the foot of the lower step on the shortest day of\r\nthe year be affected by a movement in a perpendicular direction of the\r\npoint of light to the extent of 23', or 1/3 of a degree\"? The effect would\r\nbe widely different at different times of the year, being greatest at\r\nmid-winter when the shadows are longest, and least at mid-summer when\r\nthe shadows are shortest. It follows from this that January 13 being a\r\nday but three weeks removed from mid-winter day the normal shadow would\r\nbe not far from its longest possible length, and the effect of a\r\ndisplacement of 23' would be neither more nor less than 1/12th of the\r\nwhole range of the steps whatever that range might have been. This\r\nextent of motion, then, is fully sufficient to satisfy the condition\r\nprescribed by the Biblical narrative of there being such a deflection of\r\nthe Sun's light as would affect the shadow to the extent implied by the\r\nwords \"ten steps\" or \"ten degrees,\" which is virtually the same idea.\r\nThe same extent of motion could not have been produced under the same\r\nconditions either a few days earlier or a few days later; that may\r\ncertainly be taken for granted. And the only point in which we are\r\nnecessarily in doubt arises from the fact that we are ignorant of the\r\nactual number and nature of the graduations of Ahaz's so-called \"Dial.\"\r\nIf it were permissible to assume that there were 120 graduations on the\r\ninstrument, be they steps properly so-called on a structure erected in\r\nthe open air or be they lines on a flat surface on some instrument\r\nstanding in a room, or what not, then the problem is solved, for 1/12\r\n(as above) of 120 is ten--the \"ten degrees\" stated in the history.\r\n\r\nAs to whether the \"dial\" of Ahaz was a device built up of masonry in the\r\nopen air or was an instrument for indoor use we know absolutely nothing,\r\nand speculation is useless. There is something to be said on both sides.\r\nBosanquet, on abstract grounds, leans to the latter view; on the other\r\nhand he calls attention to the present existence in India, at Delhi and\r\nBenares, of ruined Hindoo observatories in the form of huge masonry\r\nsun-dials many yards in length and breadth and height.[33]\r\n\r\nFinally it may be pointed out that there is some incidental confirmation\r\nto be found for this Hezekiah incident having happened in winter. That\r\nthe season of the year was winter seems to be suggested by the word used\r\nin the original Hebrew in connection with the return of the shadow.\r\n\r\n\"Backward\" in Isaiah xxxviii. 8 might also be translated, \"From the\r\nend.\" It would be very natural to hold that this implied that the motion\r\nof the shadow was upwards from the _lower_ end of the group of steps\r\ntowards which the shadow had gone down. Now the lower end of the steps\r\ncould only have been the place of the shadow in December or January at\r\nor near the time of the winter solstice. Moreover the mention of the\r\n\"lump of figs\" seems to suggest the winter season. A cake of figs means\r\ndried figs, not newly gathered summer figs.\r\n\r\nPutting all the facts together we may fairly conclude that the\r\nastronomical event which happened in connection with Hezekiah's illness\r\nwas an eclipse of the Sun, and that its date was January 11, 689 B.C.\r\n\r\nA few other Scripture passages need a passing mention. In Isaiah xiii.\r\n10 we read:--\r\n\r\n\"The Sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the Moon shall not\r\ncause her light to shine.\" It has been thought by Johnson that this\r\npassage is an allusion to an eclipse of the Sun, and so it might be; but\r\non the other hand, it may be no more than one of those highly figurative\r\nphrases which abound in holy Scripture, and of which the well-known\r\npassage, \"The stars in their courses fought against Sisera\" (Judges v.\r\n20), is a familiar example.\r\n\r\nIn Jeremiah x. 2 we read:--\r\n\r\n\"Be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at\r\nthem.\" This is cited as an eclipse allusion by Johnson, who points out\r\nthat the utterance of this caution preceded by about fifteen years the\r\ncelebrated eclipse of Thales (585 B.C.). But surely this is far-fetched.\r\nI shall be inclined to attach the same criticism to his next citation.\r\nEzekiel employs these expressions:--\"When I shall put thee out, I will\r\ncover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the Sun\r\nwith a cloud, and the Moon shall not give her light\" (xxxii. 7). This\r\nlanguage resembles, in no small degree, Isaiah's, already quoted, and,\r\nlike that, _might_ apply to the phenomenon of a solar eclipse, but\r\nwhether that was actually the prophet's intention is another matter. He\r\nmay have witnessed the eclipse of 585 B.C. on the banks of the river\r\nChebar, and that spectacle may have put this imagery into his head.\r\nFurther than this it seems hardly safe to go.\r\n\r\nThis seems an appropriate place to mention a very interesting matter, to\r\nwhich attention has been called by Oriental scholars in recent times,\r\nwho have investigated Assyrian and Egyptian monuments, and other\r\nmonuments of the same type. The story would be a long and interesting\r\none if presented in detail, and would far exceed my limits of space. I\r\nmust, therefore, be content with such a summary as that which has been\r\nworked out by Mr. E. W. Maunder. Briefly the facts are these. There are\r\nto be found in many places carvings in stone, symbolic of the Sun-god\r\nonce worshipped in the East. The general design, with of course\r\nvariations, is a circle with striated wings extending right and left to\r\ntwo diameters of the wing, more or less, with a lesser extension in a\r\ndownward direction. Allowing for the roughness of the art, and for the\r\nfact that the material was stone, it does not require any very great\r\nstretch of imagination to see in these carvings the disc of a\r\ntotally-eclipsed Sun with, right and left and below it, that form of\r\ncorona which we have come to associate with total eclipses occurring at\r\nperiods of Sun-spot minima.[34] This idea should not seem far-fetched if\r\nwe bear in mind the fact that the ancient Orientals worshipped the Sun,\r\nMoon, and Planets; and one of the natural outcomes of this is submitted\r\nfor our consideration by Maunder in the words following[35]:--\r\n\r\n\"There can be little doubt that the Sun was regarded partly as a symbol,\r\npartly as a manifestation of the unseen, unapproachable Divinity. Its\r\nlight and heat, its power of calling into active exercise the\r\nmysterious forces of germination and ripening, the universality of its\r\ninfluence, all seemed the fit expressions of the yet greater powers\r\nwhich belonged to the Invisible. What happened in a total solar eclipse?\r\nFor a short time that which seemed so perfect a divine symbol was\r\ncompletely hidden. The light and heat, the two great forms of solar\r\nenergy, were withdrawn, but something took their place. A mysterious\r\nlight of mysterious form, unlike any other light, unlike any other\r\nsingle form, was seen in its place. Could they fail to see in this a\r\ncloser, a more intimate revelation, a more exalted symbolism of the\r\nDivine Nature and Presence? Just as in the various Greek 'mysteries' the\r\nstudent was gradually advanced from one set of symbols to another even\r\nmore abstruse and esoteric, so here, on the broad face of heaven itself,\r\nvouchsafed for a brief space of time and at long intervals apart, the\r\nDeity revealed Himself to the initiated by a higher and more difficult\r\nsymbol than ordinarily. The symbol would vary in shape. We may take it\r\nfor granted that the old Chaldeans, as modern astronomers to-day, had at\r\none time or another presented to them every type of Coronal structure.\r\nBut there would, no doubt, be a difficulty in grasping or remembering\r\nthe irregular details of the Corona as seen in most eclipses. It\r\noccasionally happens, however, that the Corona shows itself under a form\r\nof grand and striking simplicity. It is now widely recognised that the\r\ntypical Corona of the minimum of the Sun-spot cycle consists chiefly of\r\ntwo great equatorial streamers.\"\r\n\r\nMaunder then goes on to cite certain American pictures by Trouvelot and\r\nothers of the eclipse of July 29, 1878, in which the great extension of\r\nthe Corona to the East and the West is specially shown. One drawing in\r\nparticular, by Miss K. E. Wolcott, exhibits the Sun with a perfect\r\nbright ring round it from which the Coronal streamers emanate in the\r\ndirections mentioned. Maunder then remarks that he has a strong\r\nconviction that it was a Corona of this type which was the origin of the\r\n\"Ring with Wings,\" the symbol which on Assyrian monuments is always\r\nshown as floating over the head of the ring which is designed to\r\nindicate the presence and protection of the Deity. In the article cited\r\nhe gives illustrations of two forms under which the \"Ring with Wings\"\r\nappears on Assyrian and Egyptian monuments respectively, remarking that\r\n\"Egyptians too were Astronomers and Sun-worshippers and were experts in\r\nthe language of symbols. Equally with the Chaldeans the Egyptian priests\r\nshould have regarded the Corona as a symbolical revelation of the Deity\r\nwhose usual manifestation they recognised in the Sun, and accordingly we\r\nfind them employing a symbol which is almost as perfect a representation\r\nof the Corona of minimum as that which the Assyrians adopted.\" Another\r\ncurious point commented upon by Maunder is that the Assyrians frequently\r\ninsert the figure of their Deity within the ring, and attach thereto a\r\nkilt-like dress. Even when they show the ring without the figure the\r\n\"kilt,\" as it may be called, is still there, indicating that it is not\r\nsimply a garment worn by the figure, but an integral part of the\r\nsymbol. This \"kilt\" is represented as pleated, and the resemblance of\r\nthe pleatings to the polar rays shown in Trouvelot's drawing of the\r\nCorona, is \"practically perfect.\" On this point Maunder adds:--\"If this\r\nbe a mere chance coincidence, it seems to me a most extraordinary one.\"\r\nHe concludes by saying that these symbols, so frequently met with, and\r\nso clearly designed to indicate the presence of the Deity, \"are, in\r\ntheir origin, drawings of the solar Corona, as seen at the Sun-spot\r\nminimum, and as such are the earliest eclipse representations which have\r\nbeen preserved to us.\"\r\n\r\nI give these ideas for what they are worth; they are very ingeniously\r\nworked out, and though the argument is not conclusive, yet I do think\r\nthat there is enough in it to be worth attention.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: Less certain is the allusion in Amos v. 8:--\"Seek him\r\n    that ... maketh the day dark with night.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: _Annales_, A.M., 3213, p. 45.

But these remarks do not, however, quite apply to the\r\nfirst eclipse which will be mentioned.\r\n\r\nPlutarch, in his _Life of Romulus_, refers to some remarkable incident\r\nconnected, in point of time at any rate, with his death:--\"The air on\r\nthat occasion was suddenly convulsed and altered in a wonderful manner,\r\nfor the light of the Sun failed, and they were involved in an\r\nastonishing darkness, attended on every side with dreadful thunderings\r\nand tempestuous winds.\" This so-called darkness is considered to have\r\nbeen the same as that mentioned by Cicero.[36] There is so much myth\r\nabout Romulus that it is not safe to write in confident language.\r\nNevertheless it is a fact, according to Johnson, that there was a very\r\nlarge eclipse of the Sun visible at Rome in the afternoon of May 26, 715\r\nB.C., and 715 B.C. is supposed to have been the year, or about the year,\r\nof the death of Romulus. Plutarch is also responsible for the statement\r\nthat a great eclipse of the Sun took place sometime before the birth of\r\nRomulus; and if there is anything in this statement Johnson thinks that\r\nthe annular eclipse of November 28, 771 B.C., might meet the\r\ncircumstances of the case, but too much romance attaches to the history\r\nof Romulus for anyone to write with assurance respecting the\r\ncircumstances of his career. Much of it is generally considered to be\r\nfabulous.\r\n\r\nIn one of the extant fragments of the Greek poet Archilochus (said to be\r\nthe first who introduced iambics into his verses), the following\r\nsentence occurs:--\"Zeus the father of the Olympic Gods turned mid-day\r\ninto night hiding the light of the dazzling sun; an overwhelming dread\r\nfell upon men.\" The poet's language may evidently apply to a total\r\neclipse of the Sun; and investigations by Oppolzer and Millosevich make\r\nit probable that the reference is to the total eclipse of the Sun which\r\nhappened on April 6, 648 B.C. This was total at about 10 a.m. at Thasos\r\nand in the northern part of the Ægean Sea. The acceptance of this date\r\ndisplaces by about half a century the date commonly assigned for the\r\npoet's career, but this is not thought to be of much account having\r\nregard to the hazy character of Grecian chronology before the Persian\r\nwars.[37]\r\n\r\nOn May 28, 585 B.C. there occurred an eclipse the surrounding\r\ncircumstances of which present several features of particular interest.\r\nOne of the most celebrated of the astronomers of antiquity was Thales of\r\nMiletus, and his astronomical labours were said to have included a\r\nprediction of this eclipse, which moreover has the further interest to\r\nus that it has assisted chronologists and historians in fixing the\r\nprecise date of an important event in ancient history. Herodotus[38]\r\ndescribing a war which had been going on for some years between the\r\nLydians and the Medes gives the following account of the circumstances\r\nwhich led to its premature termination:--\"As the balance had not inclined\r\nin favour of either nation, another engagement took place in the sixth\r\nyear of the war, in the course of which, just as the battle was growing\r\nwarm, day was suddenly turned into night. This event had been foretold\r\nto the Ionians by Thales of Miletus, who predicted for it the very year\r\nin which it actually took place. When the Lydians and Medes observed the\r\nchange they ceased fighting, and were alike anxious to conclude peace.\"\r\nPeace was accordingly agreed upon and cemented by a twofold marriage.\r\n\"For (says the historian) without some strong bond, there is little\r\nsecurity to be found in men's covenants.\" The exact date of this eclipse\r\nwas long a matter of discussion, and eclipses which occurred in 610 B.C.\r\nand 593 B.C. were each thought at one time or another to have been the\r\none referred to. The question was finally settled by the late Sir G. B.\r\nAiry, after an exhaustive inquiry, in favour of the eclipse of 585 B.C.\r\nThis date has the further advantage of harmonising certain statements\r\nmade by Cicero and Pliny as to its having happened in the 4th year of\r\nthe 48th Olympiad.\r\n\r\nAnother word or two may be interesting as regards the share which Thales\r\nis supposed to have had in predicting this eclipse, the more so, that\r\nvery high authorities in the domains of astronomy, and chronology, and\r\nantiquities take opposite sides in the matter. Sir G. C. Lewis, Bart.,\r\nM.P., may be cited first as one of the unbelievers. He says[39] that\r\nThales is \"reported to have predicted it to the _Ionians_. If he had\r\npredicted it to the Lydians, in whose country the eclipse was to be\r\ntotal, his conduct would be intelligible, but it seems strange that he\r\nshould have predicted it to the Ionians who had no direct interest in\r\nthe event.\" Bosanquet replies to this by pointing out that Miletus, in\r\n_Ionia_, was the birthplace of Thales, and also that a shadow, covering\r\ntwo degrees of latitude, passing through Ionia, would also necessarily\r\ncover Lydia.\r\n\r\nAnother dissentient is Sir H. C. Rawlinson,[40] who, remembering that\r\nThales is said to have predicted a good olive crop, and Anaxagoras the\r\nfall of an aërolite, says:--\"The prediction of this eclipse by Thales may\r\nfairly be classed with the prediction of a good olive crop, or the fall\r\nof an aërolite. Thales, indeed, could only have obtained the requisite\r\nknowledge for predicting eclipses from the Chaldeans; and that the\r\nscience of these astronomers, although sufficient for the investigation\r\nof lunar eclipses, did not enable them to calculate solar\r\neclipses--dependent as such a calculation is, not only on the\r\ndetermination of the period of recurrence, but on the true projection\r\nalso of the track of the Sun's shadow along a particular line over the\r\nsurface of the earth--may be inferred from our finding that in the\r\nastronomical canon of Ptolemy, which was compiled from the Chaldean\r\nregisters, the observations of the Moon's eclipse are alone entered.\"\r\n\r\nAiry[41] replied to these observations as follows:--\"I think it not at\r\nall improbable that the eclipse was so predicted, and there is one easy\r\nway, and only one of predicting it--namely, by the _Saros_, or period of\r\n18 years, 10 days, 8 hours nearly. By use of this period an evening\r\neclipse may be predicted from a morning eclipse but a morning eclipse\r\ncan rarely be predicted from an evening eclipse (as the interval of\r\neight hours after an evening eclipse will generally throw the eclipse at\r\nthe end of the _Saros_ into the hours of night). The evening eclipse,\r\ntherefore, of B.C. 585, May 28, which I adopt as being most certainly\r\nthe eclipse of Thales, might be predicted from the morning eclipse of\r\nB.C. 603, May 17.... No other of the eclipses discussed by Baily and\r\nOltmanns present the same facility for prediction.\"\r\n\r\nXenophon[42] mentions an eclipse as having led to the capture by the\r\nPersians of the Median city Larissa. In the retreat of the Greeks on the\r\neastern side of the Tigris, they crossed the river Zapetes and also a\r\nravine, and then reached the Tigris. According to Xenophon, they found\r\nat this place a large deserted city formerly inhabited by the Medes. Its\r\nwall was 25 feet thick and 100 feet high; its circumference 2 parasangs\r\n[= 7½ miles]. It was built of burnt brick on an under structure of\r\nstone 20 feet in height. Xenophon then proceeds to say that \"when the\r\nPersians obtained the Empire from the Medes, the King of the Persians\r\nbesieged the city but was unable by any means to take it till a cloud\r\nhaving covered the Sun and caused it to disappear completely, the\r\ninhabitants withdrew in alarm, and thus the city was captured. Close to\r\nthis city was a pyramid of stone, one plethrum in breadth, two plethra\r\nin height.... Thence the Greeks proceeded six parasangs to a great\r\ndeserted castle by a city called Mespila formerly inhabited by the\r\nMedes; the substructure of its wall was of squared stone abounding in\r\nshells ... the King of the Persians besieged it but could not take it;\r\nZeus terrified the inhabitants with thunderbolts, and so the city was\r\ntaken.\"\r\n\r\nThe minute description here given by Xenophon enabled Sir A. H. Layard,\r\nCaptain Felix Jones, and others, to identify Larissa with the modern\r\nNimrud and Mespila with Mosul. A suspicion is thrown out in some\r\neditions of the _Anabasis_ that the language cited might refer to an\r\neclipse of the Sun. It is to be noted, however, that it is not included\r\nby Ricciolus in the list of eclipses mentioned in ancient writers which\r\nhe gives in his _Almagestum Novum_. Sir G. B. Airy, having had his\r\nattention called to the matter, examined roughly all the eclipses which\r\noccurred during a period of 40 years, covering the supposed date implied\r\nby Xenophon. Having selected two, he computed them accurately but found\r\nthem inapplicable. He then tried another (May 19, 557 B.C.) which he had\r\npreviously passed over because he doubted its totality, and he had the\r\ngreat satisfaction of finding that the eclipse, though giving a small\r\nshadow, had been total, and that it had passed so near to Nimrud that\r\nthere could be no doubt of its being the eclipse sought.\r\n\r\nSir G. B. Airy was such a very careful worker and investigator of\r\neclipses that his conclusions in this matter have met with general\r\nacceptance. It must, however, in fairness be stated that a very\r\ncompetent American astronomer, Professor Newcomb, has expressed doubts\r\nas to whether after all Xenophon's allusion is to an eclipse, but,\r\njudging by his closing words, the learned American does not seem quite\r\nsatisfied with his own scepticism, for he says--\"Notwithstanding my want\r\nof confidence, I conceive the possibility of a real eclipse to be\r\ngreater than in the eclipse of Thales, while we have the great\r\nadvantages that the point of occurrence is well defined, the shadow\r\nnarrow, and, if it was an eclipse at all, the circumstance of totality\r\nplaced beyond serious doubt.\"[43]\r\n\r\nIn the same year as that in which, according to the common account, the\r\nbattle of Salamis was fought (480 B.C.), there occurred a phenomenon\r\nwhich is thus adverted to by Herodotus[44]--\"At the first approach of\r\nSpring the army quitted Sardis and marched towards Abydos; at the moment\r\nof its departure the Sun suddenly quitted its place in the heavens and\r\ndisappeared though there were no clouds in sight and the day was quite\r\nclear; day was thus turned into night.\" We are told[45] that \"As the\r\nking was going against Greece, and had come into the region of the\r\nHellespont, there happened an eclipse of the Sun in the East; this sign\r\nportended to him his defeat, for the Sun was eclipsed in the region of\r\nits rising, and Xerxes was also marching from that quarter.\" So far as\r\nwords go these accounts admirably befit a total eclipse of the Sun, but\r\nregarded as such it has given great trouble to chronologers, and the\r\nidentification of the eclipse is still uncertain. Hind's theory is that\r\nthe allusion is to an eclipse and in particular to the eclipse of\r\nFebruary 17, 478 B.C. Though not total at Sardis yet the eclipse was\r\nvery large, 94/100ths of the Sun being covered. If we accept this, it\r\nfollows that the usually recognised date for the battle of Salamis must\r\nbe altered by two years. Airy thought it \"extremely probable\" that the\r\nnarrative related to the total eclipse of the _Moon_, which happened on\r\nMarch 13, 479 B.C., but this is difficult to accept, especially as\r\nPlutarch, in his _Life of Pelopidas_, says--\"An army was soon got ready,\r\nbut as the general was on the point of marching, the Sun began to be\r\neclipsed, and the city was covered with darkness in the daytime.\" This\r\nseems explicit enough, assuming the record to be true and that the same\r\nincident is referred to by Plutarch as by Herodotus and Aristides.\r\n\r\nSince the time when Airy and Hind examined this question, all the known\r\nfacts have been again reviewed by Mr. W. T. Lynn, who pronounces, but\r\nwith some hesitation, in favour of the eclipse of October 2, 480 B.C.,\r\nas the one associated with the battle of Salamis. He does this by\r\nrefusing to see in the above quotations from Herodotus any allusion to a\r\nsolar eclipse at all, but invites us to consider a later statement in\r\nHerodotus[46] as relating to an eclipse though the historian only calls\r\nit a prodigy.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Thermopylæ the Peloponnesian Greeks commenced to\r\nfortify the isthmus of Corinth with the view of defending it with their\r\nsmall army against the invading host of Xerxes. The Spartan troops were\r\nunder the command of Cleombrotus, the brother of Leonidas, the hero of\r\nThermopylæ. He had been consulting the oracles at Sparta, and Herodotus\r\nstates that \"while he was offering sacrifice to know if he should march\r\nout against the Persian, the Sun was suddenly darkened in mid-sky.\" This\r\noccurrence so frightened Cleombrotus that he drew off his forces and\r\nreturned home. It is uncertain from the narrative of Herodotus whether\r\nCleombrotus returned to Sparta in the autumn of the year of the battle\r\nof Salamis, or in the spring of the next following year which was that\r\nin which the battle of Platæa was fought. Bishop Thirlwall[47] thinks\r\nthat it was the latter, but Lynn pronounces for the former, adding that\r\nthe date may well have been in October, and the solar eclipse of October\r\n2, 480 B.C. may have been the phenomenon which attracted notice,\r\nparticularly as the Sun would have been high in the heavens, the\r\ngreatest phase (6/10ths) occurring, according to Hind, at 50 minutes\r\npast noon. Here I must leave the matter, merely remarking that this\r\nalternative explanation obviates the necessity for disturbing the\r\ncommonly received date of the battle of Salamis.\r\n\r\nThucydides states that during the Peloponnesian war \"things formerly\r\nrepeated on hearsay, but very rarely confirmed by facts, became not\r\nincredible, both about earthquakes and eclipses of the Sun which came to\r\npass more frequently than had been remembered in former times.\" One such\r\neclipse he assigns to the first year of the war and says[48] that \"in\r\nthe same summer, at the beginning of a new lunar month (at which time\r\nalone the phenomenon seems possible) the Sun was eclipsed after mid-day,\r\nand became full again after it had assumed a crescent form and after\r\nsome of the stars had shone out.\" Aug. 3, 431 B.C. is generally\r\nrecognised as the date of this event. The eclipse was not total only\r\nthree-fourths of the Sun's disc being obscured. Venus was 20° and\r\nJupiter 43° distant from the Sun, so probably these were the \"stars\"\r\nthat were seen. This eclipse nearly prevented the Athenian expedition\r\nagainst the Lacedæmonians. The sailors were frightened by it, but a\r\nhappy thought occurred to Pericles, the commander of the Athenian\r\nforces. Plutarch, in his _Life of Pericles_, says:--\"The whole fleet was\r\nin readiness, and Pericles on board his own galley, when there happened\r\nan eclipse of the Sun. The sudden darkness was looked upon as an\r\nunfavourable omen, and threw the sailors into the greatest\r\nconsternation. Pericles observing that the pilot was much astonished and\r\nperplexed, took his cloak, and having covered his eyes with it, asked\r\nhim if he found anything terrible in that, or considered it as a bad\r\npresage? Upon his answering in the negative, he said, 'Where is the\r\ndifference, then between this and the other, except that something\r\nbigger than my cloak causes the eclipse?'\"\r\n\r\nAnother eclipse is mentioned by Thucydides[49] in connection with an\r\nexpedition of the Athenians against Cythera. He says:--\"At the very\r\ncommencement of the following summer there was an eclipse of the Sun at\r\nthe time of a new moon, and in the early part of the same month an\r\nearthquake.\" This has been identified with the annular eclipse of March\r\n21, 424 B.C., the central line of which passed across Northern Europe.\r\nIt is not quite clear whether the historian wishes to insinuate that the\r\neclipse caused the earthquake or the earthquake the eclipse.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse known as that of Ennius is another of the eclipses antecedent\r\nto the Christian Era which has been the subject of full modern\r\ninvestigation, and the circumstances of which are such that, in the\r\nlanguage of Professor Hansen, \"it may be reckoned as one of the most\r\ncertain and well-established eclipses of antiquity.\" The record of it\r\nhas only been brought to light in modern times by the discovery of\r\nCicero's Treatise, _De Republicâ_. According to Cicero,[50] Ennius the\r\ngreat Roman poet, who lived in the second century B.C., and who died of\r\ngout contracted, it is said, by frequent intoxication, recorded an\r\ninteresting event in the following words:--_Nonis Junii soli luna\r\nobstetit et nox_, \"On the Nones of June the Moon was in opposition to\r\nthe Sun and night.\" This singular phrase has long been assumed to allude\r\nto an eclipse of the Sun, but the precise interpretation of the words\r\nwas not for a long time realised. In Cicero's time the Nones of June\r\nfell on the 5th, but in the time of Ennius, who lived a century and a\r\nhalf before Cicero, the Nones of June fell between June 5 and July 4 on\r\naccount of the lunar years and the intercalary month of the Roman\r\nCalendar. The date of this eclipse is distinctly known to be June 21,\r\n400 B.C., but the hour was long in dispute. Professor Zech found that\r\nthe Sun set at Rome eclipsed, and that the maximum phase took place\r\nafter sun-set. Hansen, however, with his better Tables, found that the\r\neclipse was total at Rome, and that the totality ended at 7.33 p.m., the\r\nSun setting almost immediately afterwards at 7.36. This fact, Hansen\r\nconsiders, explains the otherwise unintelligible passage of Ennius\r\nquoted above: instead of saying _et nox_, he should have said _et simul\r\nnox_, \"and immediately it was night.\" Newcomb questions the totality of\r\nthis eclipse, but assigns no clear reasons for his doubts.[51]\r\n\r\nOn August 14, 394 B.C., there was a large eclipse of the Sun visible in\r\nthe Mediterranean. It occurred in the forenoon, and is mentioned by\r\nXenophon[52] in connection with a naval engagement in which the Persians\r\nwere defeated by Conon.\r\n\r\nPlutarch, in his _Life of Pelopidas_, relates how one, Alexander of\r\nPheræ, had devastated several cities of Thessaly, and that as soon as\r\nthe oppressed inhabitants had learned that Pelopidas had come back from\r\nan embassy on which he had been to the King of Persia, they sent\r\ndeputies to him to Thebes to beg the favour of armed assistance, with\r\nPelopidas as general. \"The Thebans willingly granted their request, and\r\nan army was soon got ready, but as the general was on the point of\r\nmarching, the Sun began to be eclipsed, and the city was covered with\r\ndarkness in the day-time.\" This eclipse is generally identified with\r\nthat of July 13, 364 B.C. If this is correct, Plutarch's language must\r\nbe incorrect, or at least greatly exaggerated, for no more than about\r\nthree-fourths of the Sun was obscured.\r\n\r\nOn February 29, 357 B.C., there happened an eclipse, also visible in or\r\nnear the Mediterranean. This is supposed to have been the eclipse for\r\nthe prediction of which Helicon, a friend of Plato, received from\r\nDionysius, King of Syracuse, payment in the shape of a talent.\r\n\r\nWe have now to consider another ancient eclipse which has a history of\r\npeculiar interest as regards the investigations to which it has been\r\nsubjected. It is commonly known as the \"Eclipse of Agathocles,\" and is\r\nrecorded by two historians of antiquity in the words following. Diodorus\r\nSiculus[53] says:--\r\n\r\n\"Agathocles also, though closely pursued by the enemy, by the advantage\r\nof the night coming on (beyond all hope), got safe off from them. The\r\nnext day there was such an eclipse of the Sun, that the stars appeared\r\neverywhere in the firmament, and the day was turned into night, upon\r\nwhich Agathocles's soldiers (conceiving that God thereby did foretell\r\ntheir destruction) fell into great perplexities and discontents\r\nconcerning what was like to befall them.\"\r\n\r\nJustin says[54]:--\r\n\r\n\"By the harangue the hearts of the soldiers were somewhat elevated, but\r\nan eclipse of the Sun that had happened during their voyage still\r\npossessed them with superstitious fears of a bad omen. The king was at\r\nno less pain to satisfy them about this affair than about the war, and\r\ntherefore he told them that he should have thought this sign an ill\r\npresage for them, if it had happened before they set out, but having\r\nhappened afterwards he could not but think it presaged ill to those\r\nagainst whom they marched. Besides, eclipses of the luminaries always\r\nsignify a change of affairs, and therefore some change was certainly\r\nsignified, either to Carthage, which was in such a flourishing\r\ncondition, or to them whose affairs were in a very ruinous state.\"\r\n\r\nThe substance of these statements is that in the year 310 B.C.\r\nAgathocles, Tyrant of Syracuse, while conducting his fleet from Syracuse\r\nto the Coast of Africa, found himself enveloped in the shadow of an\r\neclipse, which evidently, from the accounts, was total. His fleet had\r\nbeen chased by the Carthaginians on leaving Syracuse the preceding day,\r\nbut got away under the cover of night. On the following morning about 8\r\nor 9 a.m. a sudden darkness came on which greatly alarmed the sailors.\r\nSo considerable was the darkness, that numerous stars appeared. It is\r\nnot at the first easy to localise the position of the fleet, except that\r\nwe may infer that it could hardly have got more than 80 or at the most\r\n100 miles away from the harbour of Syracuse where it had been closely\r\nblockaded by a Carthaginian fleet. Agathocles would not have got away at\r\nall but for the fact that a relieving fleet was expected, and the\r\nCarthaginians were obliged to relax their blockade in order to go in\r\nsearch of the relieving fleet. Thus it came about not only that\r\nAgathocles set himself free, but was able to retaliate on his enemies by\r\nlanding on the coast of Africa at a point near the modern Cape Bon, and\r\ndevastating the Carthaginian territories. The voyage thither occupied\r\nsix days, and the eclipse occurred on the second day. Though we are not\r\ninformed of the route followed by Agathocles, that is to say whether he\r\npassed round the North or the South side of the island of Sicily, yet it\r\nhas been made clear by astronomers that the southern side was that\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nBaily, who was the first modern astronomer to investigate the\r\ncircumstances of this eclipse, found that there was an irreconcilable\r\ndifference between the path of the shadow found by himself and the\r\nhistorical statement, a gap of about 180 geographical miles seeming to\r\nintervene between the most southerly position which could be assigned to\r\nthe fleet of Agathocles, and the most northerly possible limit of the\r\npath of the eclipse shadow. This was the condition of the problem when\r\nSir G. B. Airy took it up in 1853.[55] He, however, was able to throw an\r\nentirely new light upon the matter. The tables used by Baily were\r\ndistinctly inferior to those now in use, and Sir G. B. Airy thought\r\nhimself justified in saying that to obviate the discordance of 180 miles\r\njust referred to \"it is only necessary to suppose an error of 3' in the\r\ncomputed distances of the Sun and Moon at conjunction, a very\r\ninconsiderable correction for a date anterior to the epoch of the tables\r\nby more than twenty-one centuries.\"\r\n\r\nIt deserves to be mentioned, though the point cannot here be dwelt upon\r\nat much length, that these ancient eclipses all hang together in such a\r\nway that it is not sufficient for the man of Astronomy and the man of\r\nChronology to agree on one eclipse, unless they can harmonise the facts\r\nof several.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the eclipse of Thales, the date of which was long and much\r\ndisputed, has a material bearing on the eclipse of Agathocles, the date\r\nof which admits of no dispute; and one of the problems which had to be\r\nsolved half a century ago was how best to use the eclipse of Agathocles\r\nto determine the date of that of Thales. If 610 B.C. were accepted for\r\nthe Thales eclipse, so as to throw the zone of total darkness anywhere\r\nover Asia Minor (where for the sake of history it was essential to put\r\nit) the consequence would be that the shadow of the eclipse of 310 B.C.\r\nwould have been thrown so far on to land, in Africa, as to make it out\r\nof the question for Agathocles and his fleet to have been in it, yet we\r\nknow for a certainty that he was in it in that year, and no other year.\r\nConversely, if 603 B.C. were accepted for the Thales eclipse, then to\r\nraise northwards the position of the shadow in that year from the line\r\nof the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, that it might pass through Asia\r\nMinor, would so raise the position of the shadow in 310 B.C. as to throw\r\nit far too much to the N. of Sicily for Agathocles, who we know must\r\nhave gone southwards to Africa, to have entered it. But if we assume 585\r\nB.C. as the date of the eclipse of Thales, we obtain a perfect\r\nreconciliation of everything that needs to be reconciled; the shadow of\r\nthe eclipse of 585 B.C. will be found to have passed where ancient\r\nhistory tells us it did pass--namely, through Ionia, and therefore\r\nthrough the centre of Asia Minor, and on the direct route from Lydia to\r\nMedia; whilst we also find that the shadow of the 310 B.C. eclipse, that\r\nis the one in the time of Agathocles, passed within 100 miles of\r\nSyracuse, a fact which is stated almost in those very words by the two\r\nhistorians who have recorded the doings of Agathocles and his fleet in\r\nthose years.\r\n\r\nThis is where the matter was left by Airy in 1853. Four years later the\r\nnew solar and lunar tables of the German astronomer Hansen were\r\npublished, and having been applied to the eclipse of 585 B.C., the\r\nconclusions just stated were amply confirmed. As if to make assurance\r\ndoubly sure, Airy went over his ground again, testing his former\r\nconclusions with regard to the eclipse of Thales by the eclipse of\r\nLarissa, in 557 B.C. already referred to, and bringing in the eclipse\r\nof Stiklastad in 1030 A.D., to be referred to presently. And as the\r\nfinal result, it may be stated that all the foregoing dates are now\r\nknown to an absolute certainty, especially confirmed as they were in all\r\nessential points by a computer of the eminence of the late Mr. J. R.\r\nHind.\r\n\r\nOn a date which corresponds to February 11, 218 or 217 B.C., an eclipse\r\nof the Sun, which was partial in Italy, is mentioned by Livy.[56]\r\nNewcomb found that the central line passed a long way from Italy, to\r\nwit, \"far down in Africa.\"\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the Sun is mentioned by Dion Cassius[57] as having\r\nhappened when Cæsar crossed the Rubicon, a celebrated event made use of\r\nby speakers, political and otherwise, on endless occasions in modern\r\nhistory. There seems no doubt that the passage of the Rubicon took place\r\nin 51 B.C., and that the eclipse must have been that of March 7, 51 B.C.\r\nThe circumstances of this eclipse have been investigated by Hind, who\r\nfound that the eclipse was an annular one, the annular phase lasting 6½\r\nminutes in Northern Italy.\r\n\r\nArago associates the death of Julius Cæsar in 44 B.C. with an annular\r\neclipse of the Sun, but seemingly without sufficient warrant. The actual\r\nrecord is to the effect that about the time of the great warrior's death\r\nthere was an extraordinary dimness of the Sun. Whatever it was that was\r\nnoticed, clearly it could not have been an annular eclipse, because no\r\nsuch eclipse then happened. Johnson suggests that Arago confused the\r\nrecord of some meteorological interference with the Sun's light with the\r\nannular eclipse that happened seven years previously when Cæsar passed\r\nthe Rubicon, to which eclipse allusion has already been made. That there\r\nwas for a long while a great deficiency of sunshine in Italy about the\r\ntime of Cæsar's death seems clear from remarks made by Pliny, Plutarch,\r\nand Tibullus, and the words of Suetonius seem to imply something of a\r\nmeteorological character. I should not have mentioned this matter at\r\nall, but for Arago's high repute as an astronomer. According to\r\nSeneca[58] during an eclipse a comet was also seen.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting question to inquire whether any allusions to\r\neclipses are to be found in Homer, and no very certain answer can be\r\ngiven. In the _Iliad_ (book xvii., lines 366-8) the following passage\r\nwill be found:--\"Nor would you say that the Sun was safe, or the Moon,\r\nfor they were wrapt in dark haze in the course of the combat.\"\r\n\r\nIn the _Odyssey_ (book xx., lines 356-7) we find:--\"And the Sun has\r\nutterly perished from heaven and an evil gloom is overspread.\" This was\r\nconsidered by old commentators to be an allusion to an eclipse, and in\r\nthe opinion of W. W. Merry[59] \"this is not impossible, as they were\r\ncelebrating the Festival of the New Moon.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly this language has somewhat the savour of a total eclipse of\r\nthe Sun, but it is difficult to say whether the allusion is historic,\r\nas of a fact that had happened, or only a vague generality. Perhaps the\r\nlatter is the most justifiable surmise.\r\n\r\nI have in the many preceding pages been citing ancient eclipses, for the\r\nreason, more or less plainly expressed, that they are of value to\r\nastronomers as assisting to define the theory of the Moon's motions in\r\nits orbit, and this they should do; but it is not unreasonable to bring\r\nthis chapter to a close by giving the views of an eminent American\r\nastronomer as to the objections to placing too much reliance on ancient\r\naccounts of eclipses. Says Prof. S. Newcomb[60]:--\"The first difficulty\r\nis to be reasonably sure that a total eclipse was really the phenomenon\r\nobserved. Many of the statements supposed to refer to total eclipses are\r\nso vague that they may be referred to other less rare phenomena. It must\r\nnever be forgotten that we are dealing with an age when accurate\r\nobservations and descriptions of natural phenomena were unknown, and\r\nwhen mankind was subject to be imposed upon by imaginary wonders and\r\nprodigies. The circumstance which we should regard as most unequivocally\r\nmarking a total eclipse is the visibility of the stars during the\r\ndarkness. But even this can scarcely be regarded as conclusive, because\r\nVenus may be seen when there is no eclipse, and may be quite conspicuous\r\nin an annular or a considerable partial eclipse. The exaggeration of a\r\nsingle object into a plural is in general very easy. Another difficulty\r\nis to be sure of the locality where the eclipse was total. It is\r\ncommonly assumed that the description necessarily refers to something\r\nseen where the writer flourished, or where he locates his story. It\r\nseems to me that this cannot be safely done unless the statement is made\r\nin connection with some battle or military movement, in which case we\r\nmay presume the phenomena to have been seen by the army.\"\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 36: _De Republicâ_, Lib. vi., cap. 22.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 37: E.

Johnston says that the central line\r\npassed over Norway and Sweden. It seems, perhaps, a little strange that\r\na writer who lived in Bithynia in the 3rd Century of the Christian Era\r\nshould have picked up any information about something that happened in\r\nthe extreme North of Europe two centuries previously. But probably the\r\neclipse must have been seen in Italy.\r\n\r\nOn November 24, A.D. 29, there happened an eclipse of the Sun which is\r\nsometimes spoken of as the \"eclipse of Phlegon.\" Eusebius, the\r\necclesiastical historian, records Phlegon's testimony. Phlegon was a\r\nnative of Tralles in Lydia, and one of the Emperor Adrian's freedmen.\r\nThe eclipse in question happened at noon, and the stars were seen. It\r\nwas total, and the line of totality, according to Hind,[62] passed\r\nacross the Black Sea from near Odessa to Sinope, thence near the site of\r\nNineveh to the Persian Gulf. A partial eclipse with four-fifths of the\r\nSun's diameter covered was visible at Jerusalem. This is the only solar\r\neclipse which was visible at Jerusalem during the period usually fixed\r\nfor Christ's public ministry. This eclipse was for a long time, and by\r\nvarious writers, associated with the darkness which prevailed at\r\nJerusalem on the day of our Lord's Crucifixion, but there seems no\r\nwarrant whatever for associating the two events. The Crucifixion\r\ndarkness was assuredly a supernatural phenomenon, and there is nothing\r\nsupernatural in a total eclipse of the Sun. To this it may be added that\r\nboth Tertullian at the beginning of the 3rd century and Lucian, the\r\nmartyr of Nicomedia, who died in 312, appealed to the testimony of\r\nnational archives then in existence, as witnessing to the fact that a\r\nsupernatural darkness had prevailed at the time of Christ's death.\r\nMoreover, the generally recorded date of the Crucifixion, namely, April\r\n3, A.D. 33, would coincide with a full Moon. As it happened, that full\r\nMoon suffered eclipse, but she emerged from the Earth's shadow about a\r\nquarter of an hour before she rose at Jerusalem (6 h. 36 m. p.m.): the\r\npenumbra continued upon her disc for an hour afterwards.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Emperor Claudius, Dion Cassius[63] says:--\"There was\r\ngoing to be an eclipse on his birthday. Claudius feared some\r\ndisturbance, as there had been other prodigies, so he put forth a public\r\nnotice, not only that the obscuration would take place and about the\r\ntime and magnitude of it, but also about the causes which produce such\r\nevents.\" This is an interesting statement, especially in view of what I\r\nhave said on a previous page about the indifference of the Romans to\r\nAstronomy. It would, likewise, be interesting to know how Claudius\r\nacquired his knowledge, and who coached him up in the matter. This\r\neclipse occurred on August 1, A.D. 45. Barely half the Sun's diameter\r\nwas covered.\r\n\r\nPhilostratus[64] states that \"about this time while he was pursuing his\r\nstudies in Greece such an omen was observable in the heavens. A crown\r\nresembling Iris surrounded the disc of the Sun and darkened its rays.\"\r\n\"About this time\" is to be understood as referring to some date shortly\r\npreceding the death of the Emperor Domitian which occurred on September\r\n18, A.D. 96. This has usually been regarded as the earliest allusion to\r\nwhat we now call the Sun's \"Corona\"; or, as an alternative idea, that\r\nthe allusion is simply to an annular eclipse of the Sun. But both these\r\ntheories have been called in question; by Johnston because he cannot\r\nfind an eclipse which in his view of things will respond as regards date\r\nto the statement of Philostratus, and by Lynn on the same ground and on\r\nother grounds, _more suo_. The question of identification requires\r\nlooking into more fully. There was a total eclipse on May 21, A.D. 95,\r\nbut it was only visible as a partial eclipse in Western Asia and not\r\nvisible at all in Greece. This is given as the conclusion arrived at by\r\nthe German astronomer Ginzel. But it does not seem to me sufficient to\r\noverthrow, without further investigation, the fairly plain language of\r\nPhilostratus, which is possibly confirmed by a passage in Plutarch[65]\r\nin which he discusses certain eclipse phenomena in the light of a recent\r\neclipse. The date of Plutarch's \"recent\" eclipse is somewhat uncertain,\r\nbut that fact does not necessarily militate against his testimony\r\nrespecting the Corona or what is regarded to have been such. The\r\nstatement of Philostratus, treated as a mention of a total solar\r\neclipse, is accepted as sufficiently conclusive by Sir W. Huggins and\r\nthe late Professor R. Grant. Johnston, to meet the supposed difficulty\r\nof finding an eclipse to accord with the assertion of the historian,\r\nsuggests that \"perhaps some peculiar solar halo or mock Sun, or other\r\nmeteorological formation\" is referred to. But Stockwell has advanced\r\nvery good reasons for the opinion that the eclipse of Sept. 3, A.D. 118,\r\nfully meets the circumstances of the case. Grant's opinion is given in\r\nthese emphatic words:--\"It appears to me that the words here quoted\r\n[from Apollonius] refer beyond all doubt to a total eclipse of the Sun,\r\nand thus the phenomenon seen encompassing the Sun's disc was, really as\r\nwell as verbally, identical with the modern Corona.\"[66]\r\n\r\nWith the end of the first century of the Christian Era we may be said to\r\nquit the realms of classical history and to pass on to eclipse records\r\nof a different character, and, so far as regards European observations,\r\nof comparatively small scientific value or usefulness. Our information\r\nis largely derived from ecclesiastical historians and, later on, from\r\nmonkish chronicles, which as a rule are meagre in a surprising degree.\r\nPerhaps I ought not to say \"surprising,\" because after the times of the\r\nGreek astronomers (who in their way may almost be regarded as\r\nprofessionals), and after the epoch of the famous Ptolemy, Astronomy\r\nwell-nigh ceased to exist for many centuries in Europe, until, say, the\r\n15th century, barring the labours of the Arabians and their kinsmen the\r\nMoors in Spain in the 9th and following centuries.\r\n\r\nIn examining therefore the records of eclipses which have been handed\r\ndown to us from A.D. 100 forwards through more than 1000 years, I shall\r\nnot offer my readers a long dry statement of eclipse dates, but only\r\npick out here and there such particular eclipses as seem to present\r\ndetails of interest for some or other reason.\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 237 A.D., there was, according to Julius Capitolinus, an\r\neclipse of the Sun, so great \"that people thought it was night, and\r\nnothing could be done without lights.\" Ricciolus remarked that this\r\neclipse happened about the time of the Sixth Persecution of the\r\nChristians, and when the younger Gordian was proclaimed Emperor, after\r\nhis father had declined the proffered dignity, being 80 years of age.\r\nThe line of totality crossed Italy about 5 p.m. in the afternoon, to the\r\nN. of Rome, and embraced Bologna.\r\n\r\nCalvisius records, on the authority of Cedrenus, an eclipse of the Sun\r\non August 6, 324 A.D., which was sufficiently great for the stars to be\r\nseen at mid-day. The eclipse was associated with an earthquake, which\r\nshattered thirteen cities in Campania. Johnston remarks that no more\r\nthan three-fourths of the Sun's disc would have been covered, as seen in\r\nCampania, but that elsewhere in Italy, at about 3 p.m., the eclipse was\r\nmuch larger, and perhaps one or two of the planets might have been\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nOn July 17, 334 A.D., there was an eclipse, which seems to have been\r\ntotal in Sicily, if we may judge from the description given by Julius\r\nFirmicus.[67]\r\n\r\nAmmianus Marcellinus[68] describes an eclipse, to which the date of\r\nAugust 28, 360 A.D., has been assigned. Humboldt, quoting this\r\nhistorian, says that the description is quite that of a solar eclipse,\r\nbut its stated long duration (daybreak to noon), and the word _caligo_\r\n(fog or mist) are awkward factors. Moreover, the historian associates it\r\nwith events which happened in the eastern provinces of the Roman\r\nEmpire; but Johnston seems in effect to challenge Marcellinus's\r\nstatement when he says, \"It is true that there was an annular eclipse of\r\nthe Sun in the early morning on the above date, but it could only be\r\nseen in countries E. of the Persian Gulf.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Alaric, King of the Visigoths appeared before Rome,\r\nthere was a gloom so great that the stars appeared in the daytime. This\r\nnarrative is considered to apply to an eclipse of the Sun, which\r\noccurred on June 18, 410 A.D. The eclipse was an annular one, but as the\r\ncentral line must have crossed far S. of Rome, the stars must have been\r\nseen not at Rome but somewhere else.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse occurred on July 19, 418 A.D., which is remarkable for a\r\ntwofold reason. People had an opportunity not only of seeing an eclipse,\r\nbut also a comet. We owe the account of the circumstances to\r\nPhilostorgius,[69] who tells us that--\"On July 19, towards the 8th hour\r\nof the day, the Sun was so eclipsed, that even the stars were visible.\r\nBut at the same time that the Sun was thus hid, a light, in the form of\r\na cone was seen in the sky; some ignorant people called it a comet, but\r\nin this light we saw nothing that announced a comet, for it was not\r\nterminated by a tail; it resembled the flame of a torch, subsisting by\r\nitself, without any star for its base. Its movement too was very\r\ndifferent from that of a comet. It was first seen to the E. of the\r\nequinoxes; after that, having passed through the last star in the Bear's\r\ntail, it continued slowly its journey towards the W. Having thus\r\ntraversed the heavens, it at length disappeared, having lasted more than\r\nfour months. It first appeared about the middle of the summer, and\r\nremained visible until nearly the end of autumn.\"\r\n\r\nBoillot, a French writer, has suggested that this description is that of\r\nthe zodiacal light, but this seems out of the question in view of the\r\ndetails given by the Chinese of a comet having been visible in the\r\nautumn of this year for 11 weeks, and having passed through the square\r\nof Ursa Major. Reverting to the eclipse--Johnston finds that the greatest\r\nphase at Constantinople, which was probably the place of observation,\r\noccurred at about half an hour after noon, when a thin crescent of light\r\nmight have been seen on the northern limb of the Sun. From this it would\r\nappear that the central line of eclipse must have passed somewhat to the\r\nsouth of Constantinople. To the same effect Hind, who found that\r\n95/100ths of the Sun's diameter was covered at Constantinople.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the Sun seems to be referred to by Gregorius Turonensis,\r\nwhen he says[70] that:--\"Then even the Sun appeared hideous, so that\r\nscarcely a third part of it gave light, I believe on account of such\r\ndeeds of wickedness and shedding of innocent blood.\" This would seem to\r\nhave been the eclipse which occurred on February 24, 453 A.D., when\r\nAttila and the Huns were ravaging Italy, and to them it was doubtless\r\nthat the writer alluded. At Rome three-fourths of the Sun's disc would\r\nhave been eclipsed at sunset, a finding which tallies fairly with the\r\nstatement of Gregorius.\r\n\r\nIt is not till far into the 6th century that we come upon a native\r\nEnglish record of an eclipse of the Sun as having been observed in\r\nEngland. This deficiency in our national annals is thus judiciously\r\nexplained and commented on by our clever and talented American\r\nauthoress.[71] Speaking of the eclipse of February 15, 538 A.D., she\r\nsays:--\"The accounts, however, are greatly confused and uncertain, as\r\nwould perhaps be natural fully 60 years before the advent of St.\r\nAugustine, and when Britain was helplessly harassed with its continual\r\nstruggle in the fierce hands of West Saxons and East Saxons, of Picts\r\nand conquering Angles. Men have little time to record celestial\r\nhappenings clearly, much less to indulge in scientific comment and\r\ntheorising upon natural phenomena, when the history of a nation sways to\r\nand fro with the tide of battle, and what is gained to-day may be\r\nfatally lost to-morrow. And so there is little said about this eclipse,\r\nand that little is more vague and uncertain even than the monotonous\r\nplaints of Gildas--the one writer whom Britain has left us, in his meagre\r\naccounts of the conquest of Kent, and the forsaken walls and violated\r\nshrines of this early epoch.\"\r\n\r\nThe well-known _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_[72] is our authority for this\r\neclipse having been noted in England, but the record is bare\r\nindeed:--\"In this year the Sun was eclipsed 14 days before the Calends of\r\nMarch from early morning till 9 a.m.\" Tycho Brahe, borrowing from\r\nCalvisius, who borrowed from somebody else, says that the eclipse\r\nhappened \"in the 5th year of Henry, King of the West Saxons, at the 1st\r\nhour of the day till nearly the 3rd, or immediately after sunrise.\"\r\nJohnson finds that at London nearly three-fourths of the Sun's disc was\r\ncovered at 7.43 a.m.\r\n\r\nThe next eclipse recorded in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ is somewhat\r\ndifficult to explain. It is said that in 540 A.D. \"The Sun was eclipsed\r\non the 12th of the Calends of July [= June 20], and the stars appeared\r\nfull nigh half an hour after 9 a.m.\" Johnson's calculations make the\r\nmiddle of the eclipse to have occurred at about 7.37 a.m. at London,\r\ntwo-thirds of the Sun's diameter being covered. He notes that the Moon's\r\nsemi-diameter was nearly at its maximum whilst the Sun's semi-diameter\r\nwas nearly at its minimum--a favourable combination for a long totality.\r\nThe visibility of the stars seems difficult to explain in connection\r\nwith this eclipse, and therefore he suggests that the annalist has made\r\na mistake of four years and meant to refer to the eclipse of September\r\n1, 536 A.D., but this does not seem a satisfactory theory.\r\n\r\nThe year after Pope Martin held a Synod to condemn the Monothelite\r\nheresy, an eclipse of the Sun took place. It is mentioned by Tycho Brahe\r\nin his catalogue of eclipses as having been seen in England. Johnson\r\ngives the date as February 6, 650 A.D., and finds that the Sun was\r\nthree-fourths obscured at London at 3.30 p.m.\r\n\r\nThe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ tells us under the year A.D. 664 that, \"In\r\nthis year the Sun was eclipsed on the 5th of the Nones of May; and\r\nEarcenbryht, King of the Kentish people died and Ecgbryht his son\r\nsucceeded to the Kingdom.\" Kepler thought this eclipse had been total in\r\nEngland, and Johnson calculating for London found that on May 1, at 5\r\np.m., there would only have been a very thin crescent of the Sun left\r\nuncovered on the southern limb, so that the line of totality would have\r\npassed across the country some distance to the N. of London.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of Dec. 7, A.D. 671, seems to be associated with a comic\r\ntragedy. The Caliph Moawiyah had a fancy to remove Mahomet's pulpit from\r\nMedina to his own residence at Damascus. \"He said that the walking-stick\r\nand pulpit of the Apostle of God should not remain in the hands of the\r\nmurderers of Othman. Great search was made for the walking-stick, and at\r\nlast they found it. Then they went in obedience to his commands to\r\nremove the pulpit, when immediately, to their great surprise and\r\nastonishment, the Sun was eclipsed to that degree that the stars\r\nappeared.\"[73] Once again the question of visible stars is in some sense\r\na source of difficulty. Hind found that the eclipse was annular on the\r\ncentral line. At Medina the greatest phase occurred at 10h. 43m. a.m.\r\nwhen 85/100ths of the Sun's diameter was obscured. Hind suggests that in\r\nthe clear skies of that part of the world such a degree of eclipse might\r\nbe sufficient to bring out the brighter planets or stars. At any rate no\r\nlarger eclipse visible at Medina occurred about this epoch. Prof. Ockley\r\nseems to refer to this eclipse in making, on the authority of several\r\nArabian writers, the mention he does of an eclipse in the quotation just\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this will be a convenient place to bring in some remarks on\r\ncertain Arabian observations of eclipses only made known to the\r\nscientific world in modern times. That the Arabians were very capable\r\npractical astronomers has long been recognised as a well-established\r\nfact, and if it had not been for them there would have been a tremendous\r\nblank in the history of astronomy during at least six centuries from\r\nabout the year A.D. 700 onwards. In the year 1804 there was published at\r\nParis a French translation of an Arabian manuscript preserved at the\r\nUniversity of Leyden of which little was known until near the end of the\r\nlast century. The manuscript was then sent to Paris on loan to the\r\nFrench Government which caused a translation to be made by \"Citizen\"\r\nCaussin, and this was published under the title of _Le Livre de la\r\ngrande Table Hakénate_.[74] Caussin was Professor of Arabic at the\r\nCollege of France. Newcomb considers this to contain the earliest exact\r\nastronomical observations of eclipses which have reached us. He remarks\r\nthat some of the data left us by Ptolemy, Theon, Albategnius and others\r\nmay be the results of actual observations, but in no case, so far as is\r\nknown, have the figures of the actual observations been handed down. For\r\nexample, we cannot regard \"midnight\" nor \"the middle of an eclipse\" as\r\nmoments capable of direct observation without instruments of precision;\r\nbut in the Arabian work under consideration we find definite statements\r\nof the altitudes of the heavenly bodies at the moments of the beginning\r\nand ending of eclipses--data not likely to be tampered with in order to\r\nagree with the results of calculation. The eclipses recorded are 28 in\r\nnumber and usually the beginning and end of them were observed. The\r\naltitudes are given sometimes only in whole degrees, sometimes in coarse\r\nfractions of a degree. The most serious source of error to be confronted\r\nin turning these observations to account arises from the uncertainty as\r\nto how long after the first contact the eclipse was perceived and the\r\naltitude taken; and how long before the true end was the eclipse lost\r\nsight of. Making the best use he could of the records available Newcomb\r\nfound that they could safely be employed in his investigations into the\r\ntheory of the Moon.\r\n\r\nThe observations were taken, some at Bagdad and the remainder at Cairo.\r\nI do not propose to occupy space by transcribing the accounts in detail,\r\nbut one extract may be offered as a sample of the rest--\"Eclipse of the\r\nSun observed at Bagdad, August 18, 928 A.D. The Sun rose about\r\none-fourth eclipsed. We looked at the Sun on a surface of water and saw\r\nit distinctly. At the end when we found no part of the Sun was any\r\nlonger eclipsed, and that its disc appeared in the water as a complete\r\ncircle, its altitude was 12° in the E., less the one-third of a division\r\nof the instrument, which itself was divided to thirds of a degree. One\r\nmust therefore reduce the stated altitude by one-ninth of a degree,\r\nleaving, therefore, the true altitude as 11° 53' 20\".\" The skill and\r\ncare shown in this record shows that the Arab who observed this eclipse\r\nnearly a thousand years ago must have been a man of a different type\r\nfrom an ordinary resident at Bagdad in the year 1899. No description is\r\ngiven of the instrument used, but presumably it was some kind of a\r\nquadrant. It does not appear why some of the observations were made at\r\nBagdad and some at Cairo. The Bagdad observations commence with an\r\neclipse of the Sun on November 30, 829, and end with an eclipse of the\r\nMoon on November 5, 933. The Cairo observations begin with an eclipse of\r\nthe Sun on December 12, 977, and end with an eclipse of the Sun on\r\nJanuary 24, 1004. These statements apply to the 25 observations which\r\nNewcomb considered were trustworthy enough to be employed in his\r\nresearches, but he rejected three as imperfect.\r\n\r\nI have broken away from the strict thread of chronological sequence in\r\norder to keep together the notes respecting Arabian observations of\r\neclipses. Let us now revert to the European eclipses.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of A.D. 733, the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ tells us that,\r\n\"In this year Æthelbald captured Somerton; and the Sun was eclipsed, and\r\nall the Sun's disc was like a black shield; and Acca was driven from his\r\nbishopric.\" Johnston suggests that the reference is to an annular\r\neclipse which he finds occurred on August 14, at about 8¼ h. in the\r\nmorning. In Schnurrer's _Chronik der Seuchen_ (pt. i., § 113, p. 164),\r\nit is stated that, \"One year after the Arabs had been driven back across\r\nthe Pyrenees after the battle of Tours, the Sun was so much darkened on\r\nthe 19th of August as to excite universal terror.\" It may be that the\r\nEnglish eclipse is here referred to, and a date wrong by five days\r\nassigned to it by Schnurrer. Humboldt (_Cosmos_, vol. iv. p. 384, Bohn's\r\ned.) reports this eclipse in an enumeration he gives of instances of the\r\nSun having been darkened.\r\n\r\nOn May 5, A.D. 840, there happened an eclipse of the Sun which, amongst\r\nother effects, is said to have so greatly frightened Louis Le Debonnaire\r\n(Charlemagne's son) that it contributed to his death. The Emperor was\r\ntaken ill at Worms, and having been removed to Ingelheim, an island in\r\nthe Rhine, near Mayence, died there on June 20. Hind[75] found that this\r\nwas a total eclipse, and that the northern limit of totality passed\r\nabout 100 miles south of Worms. The middle of the eclipse occurred at\r\n1h. 15m. p.m. with the Sun at an altitude of 57°. The duration of the\r\neclipse was unusually long, namely about 5½ minutes. With the Sun so\r\nhigh and the obscuration lasting so long, this eclipse must have been\r\nan unusually imposing one, and well calculated to inspire special alarm.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 29, 878, in the reign of King Alfred, there was a total eclipse\r\nvisible at London. The mention of it in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ is\r\nas follows:--\"The Sun was eclipsed at 1 hour of the day.\" No month is\r\ngiven, and the year is said to have been 879, which is undoubtedly\r\nwrong. Hind found that the central line of the eclipse passed about 20\r\nmiles N. of London, and that the totality lasted 1m. 51s. Tycho Brahe in\r\nhis _Historia Coelestis_ quotes from the _Annales Fuldenses_ a statement\r\nthat the Sun was so much darkened after the 9th hour that the stars\r\nappeared in the heavens.\r\n\r\nThorpe in his edition of the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ quotes from Mr.\r\nRichard Price a note which assigns the date of March 14, 880, to this\r\neclipse, and cites in confirmation a passage from the _Chronicle of\r\nFlorence of Worcester_, anno 879. The 880 eclipse is mentioned by Asser\r\nin his _De Vitâ et Rebus gestis Alfredi_ in the words following:--\"In the\r\nsame year [879] an eclipse of the Sun took place between three o'clock\r\nand the evening, but nearer three o'clock.\" The confusion of dates is\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nIn the _Chronicon Scotorum_, under the date of 885, we find:--\"An eclipse\r\nof the Sun; and stars were seen in the heavens.\" The reference appears\r\nto be to the total eclipse of June 16, A.D. 885. The totality lasted\r\nmore than four minutes, and as the stars are said to have been visible\r\nin the North of Ireland, doubtless that part of Ireland came within the\r\neclipse limits.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 22, 968, there was an eclipse of the Sun, which was almost total\r\nat London at about 8h. 33m. a.m., or soon after sunrise. The central\r\nline passed across the S.-W. of England, and thence through France to\r\nthe Mediterranean. One Leon, a deacon at Corfu, observed this eclipse,\r\nand has left behind what probably is the first perfectly explicit\r\nmention of the Corona.[76]\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 30, 1030, there happened an eclipse visible in Norway, which has\r\nalready been alluded to on a previous page under the name of the\r\n\"eclipse of Stiklastad.\" This was one of those eclipses, the\r\ncircumstances of which were examined many years ago in detail by Sir\r\nG. B. Airy,[77] because he thought that information of value might be\r\nobtained therefrom with respect to the motions of the Moon. Its\r\navailability for that purpose has, however, been seriously questioned by\r\nProfessor Newcomb. Stiklastad is a place where a battle was fought, at\r\nwhich Olav, King of Norway, is said to have been killed. While the\r\nbattle was in progress the Sun was totally eclipsed, and a red light\r\nappeared around it. This is regarded as an early record of the Corona,\r\nthough not the first.[78] Johnston found that the eclipse was nearly\r\ntotal at about 2h. 21m. p.m.\r\n\r\nIn 1033 there happened on June 29 an eclipse of the Sun, which\r\nevidently had many observers, because it is mentioned by many\r\ncontemporary writers. For instance, the French historian, Glaber,[79]\r\nsays that \"on the 3rd of the Calends of July there was an eclipse from\r\nthe sixth to the eighth hour of the day exceedingly terrible. For the\r\nSun became of a sapphire colour; in its upper part having the likeness\r\nof a fourth part of the Moon.\" This sufficiently harmonises with\r\nJohnston's calculations that about four-fifths of the Sun on the lower\r\nside was covered at 10h. 50m. in the morning.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 61: _Hist.

It was considered a\r\npresage of misfortune to Henry I. and was thus referred to by William of\r\nMalmesbury[80]:--\r\n\r\n\"The elements manifested their sorrow at this great man's last departure\r\nfrom England. For the Sun on that day at the 6th hour shrouded his\r\nglorious face, as the poets say, in hideous darkness agitating the\r\nhearts of men by an eclipse; and on the 6th day of the week early in the\r\nmorning there was so great an earthquake that the ground appeared\r\nabsolutely to sink down; an horrid noise being first heard beneath the\r\nsurface.\"\r\n\r\nThis eclipse is also alluded to in the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ though\r\nthe year is wrongly given as 1135 instead of 1133 as it certainly was.\r\nThe _Chronicle_ says:--\"In this year King Henry went over sea at Lammas,\r\nand the second day as he lay and slept on the ship the day darkened over\r\nall lands; and the Sun became as it were a three-night-old Moon, and the\r\nstars about it at mid-day. Men were greatly wonder-stricken and\r\naffrighted, and said that a great thing should come hereafter. So it\r\ndid, for the same year the king died on the following day after St.\r\nAndrew's Mass day, Dec. 2, in Normandy.\" The king did die in 1135, but\r\nthere was no eclipse of the August new Moon, and without doubt the\r\nwriter has muddled up the year of the eclipse and of the king's\r\ndeparture from England (to which he never returned) and the year of his\r\ndeath. Calvisius states that this eclipse was observed in Flanders and\r\nthat the stars appeared.\r\n\r\nRespecting the above-mentioned discrepancy Mrs. Todd aptly remarks:--\"So\r\nHenry must have died in 1133, which he _did not_; or else there must\r\nhave been an eclipse in 1135, which there _was not_. But this is not the\r\nonly labyrinth into which chronology and old eclipses, imagination, and\r\ncomputation, lead the unwary searcher.\" Professor Freeman's explanation\r\nfairly clears up the difficulty:--\"The fact that he never came back to\r\nEngland, together with the circumstances of his voyage, seems to have\r\nmade a deep impression on men's minds. In popular belief the signs and\r\nwonders which marked his last voyage were transferred to the Lammas-tide\r\nbefore his death two years later.\"[81] The central line of this eclipse\r\ntraversed Scotland from Ross to Forfar and the eclipse was of course\r\nlarge in every part of the country. The totality lasted 4m. 20s. in\r\nForfarshire.\r\n\r\nHind has furnished some further information respecting this eclipse. It\r\nappears that during the existence of the Kingdom of Jerusalem created by\r\nthe Crusaders an eclipse occurred which would appear to have been total\r\nat Jerusalem or in its immediate neighbourhood. No date is given and a\r\ndate can only be guessed, and Hind guessed that the eclipse of 1133 was\r\nthe one referred to. He found that after leaving Scotland and crossing\r\nEurope the central line of the 1133 eclipse entered Palestine near Jaffa\r\nand passed over Jerusalem where the Sun was hidden for 4¼ minutes at\r\nabout 3h. p.m. From Nablous on the N. to Ascalon on the S. the country\r\nwas in darkness for nearly the same period of time. The alternative\r\neclipses to this one would be those of Sept. 4, 1187, magnitude at\r\nJerusalem 9/10ths of the Sun's diameter; or June 23, 1191, magnitude at\r\nthe same place about 7/10ths; but these do not seem to harmonise so well\r\nwith the accounts handed down to us as does the eclipse of 1133.\r\n\r\nIn 1140, on March 20, there happened a total eclipse of the Sun visible\r\nin England which is thus referred to by William of Malmesbury[82]:--\r\n\"During this year, in Lent, on the 13th of the Calends of April, at the\r\n9th hour of the 4th day of the week, there was an eclipse, throughout\r\nEngland, as I have heard. With us, indeed, and with all our neighbours,\r\nthe obscuration of the Sun also was so remarkable, that persons sitting\r\nat table, as it then happened almost everywhere, for it was Lent, at\r\nfirst feared that Chaos was come again: afterwards, learning the cause,\r\nthey went out and beheld the stars around the Sun. It was thought and\r\nsaid by many, not untruly, that the King [Stephen] would not continue a\r\nyear in the government.\"\r\n\r\nThe same eclipse is also thus mentioned in the _Anglo-Saxon\r\nChronicle_:--\"Afterwards in Lent the Sun and the day darkened about the\r\nnoontide of the day, when men were eating, and they lighted candles to\r\neat by; and that was the 13th of the Calends of April, March 20. Men\r\nwere greatly wonder-stricken.\" The greatest obscuration at London took\r\nplace at 2h. 36m. p.m., but it is not quite clear whether the line of\r\ntotality did actually pass over London.\r\n\r\nIt was long supposed that this eclipse was total at London, an idea\r\nwhich seems to have arisen from Halley having told the Royal Society\r\nanent the total eclipse of May 3, 1715, that he could not find that any\r\ntotal eclipse had been visible at London since March 20, 1140. In\r\nconsequence of this statement of Halley's, Hind carefully investigated\r\nthe circumstances of this eclipse, and found that it had _not_ been\r\ntotal at London. The central line entered our island at Aberystwith, and\r\npassing near Shrewsbury, Stafford, Derby, Nottingham, and Lincoln,\r\nreached the German Ocean, 10 miles S. of Saltfleet. The southern limit\r\nof the zone of totality passed through the South Midland counties, and\r\nthe nearest point of approach to London was a point on the borders of\r\nNorthamptonshire and Bedfordshire. For a position on the central line\r\nnear Stafford, Hind found that the totality began at 2h. 36m. p.m. local\r\nmean time, the duration being 3m. 26s., and the Sun's altitude being\r\nmore than 30°. The stars seen were probably the planets Mercury and\r\nVenus, then within a degree of each other, and 10° W. of the Sun, and\r\nperhaps the stars forming the well-known \"Square of Pegasus.\" Mars and\r\nSaturn were also, at that time, within a degree of each other, but very\r\nnear the western horizon. It is therefore necessary to look further back\r\nthan 1140 to find a total solar eclipse visible in London.[83]\r\n\r\nA solar eclipse seems to have been alluded to by certain historians as\r\nhaving happened in A.D. 1153. We have the obscure statement that\r\n\"something singular happened to the Sun the day after the Conversion of\r\nSt. Paul.\" A somewhat large eclipse having been visible at Augsburg in\r\nGermany, on January 26, this may have been the \"something\" referred to.\r\nIt would seem that about 11/12ths of the Sun's diameter was covered.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, A.D. 1230, there happened a great eclipse of the Sun, thus\r\ndescribed by Roger of Wendover[84]:--\"On the 14th of May, which was the\r\nTuesday in Rogation Week, an unusual eclipse of the Sun took place very\r\nearly in the morning, immediately after sunrise; and it became so dark\r\nthat the labourers, who had commenced their morning's work, were obliged\r\nto leave it, and returned again to their beds to sleep; but in about an\r\nhour's time, to the astonishment of many, the Sun regained its usual\r\nbrightness.\" This eclipse, as regards its total phase, is said by\r\nJohnston to have begun in the horizon, a little to the N. of London, in\r\nthe early morning.\r\n\r\nOn June 3, A.D. 1239, and October 6, 1241, there occurred total eclipses\r\nof the Sun, which have been very carefully discussed by Professor\r\nCeloria of Milan, with the view of using them in investigations into the\r\nMoon's mean motion.[85] The second of these eclipses is mentioned by\r\nTycho Brahe.[86] He states that \"a few stars appeared about noonday, and\r\nthe Sun was hidden from sight in a clear sky.\" The eclipse was total in\r\nEastern Europe.\r\n\r\nDr. Lingard,[87] the well-known Roman Catholic historian, speaking of\r\nthe battle of Cressy, which was fought on August 26, 1346, says:--\"Never,\r\nperhaps, were preparations for battle made under circumstances so truly\r\nawful. On that very day the Sun suffered a partial eclipse: birds in\r\nclouds, precursors of a storm, flew screaming over the two armies; and\r\nthe rain fell in torrents, accompanied with incessant thunder and\r\nlightning. About 5 in the afternoon, the weather cleared up, the Sun in\r\nfull splendour darted his rays in the eyes of the enemy; and the\r\nGenoese, setting up their shouts, discharged their quarrels.\" This was\r\nnot an eclipse, for none was due to take place; and the phenomenon could\r\nonly have been meteorological--dense clouds or something of that sort in\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 1406, there was a large eclipse of the Sun, 9/10ths of its\r\ndiameter being covered at London; but on the Continent it seems to have\r\nbeen total. It is stated that the darkness was such that people could\r\nhardly recognise one another.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated eclipses during the Middle Ages was\r\nundoubtedly that of June 17, 1433. This was long remembered in Scotland\r\nas the \"Black Hour,\" and its circumstances were fully investigated some\r\nyears ago by Hind. It was a remarkable eclipse in that the Moon was\r\nwithin 13° of perigee and the Sun only 2° from apogee. The central line\r\ntraversed Scotland in a south-easterly direction from Ross to Forfar,\r\npassing near Inverness and Dundee. Maclaurin[88] who lived in the early\r\npart of the last century mentions that in his time a manuscript account\r\nof this eclipse was preserved in the library of the University of\r\nEdinburgh wherein the darkness is said to have come on at about 3 p.m.,\r\nand to have been very profound. The duration of the totality at\r\nInverness was 4m. 32s.; at Edinburgh 3m. 41s. The central line passed\r\nfrom Britain to the N. of Frankfort-on-the-Maine, through Bavaria, to\r\nthe Dardanelles, to the S. of Aleppo and thence nearly parallel to the\r\nriver Euphrates to the N.-E. border of Arabia. In Turkey, according to\r\nCalvisius, \"near evening the light of the Sun was so overpowered that\r\ndarkness covered the land.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1544, on Jan. 24, there occurred an eclipse of the Sun which was\r\nnearly but not quite total. The chief interest arises from the fact that\r\nit was one of the first observed by professed astronomers: Gemma Frisius\r\nsaw it at Louvain.\r\n\r\nKepler says[89] that the day became dark like the twilight of evening\r\nand that the birds which from the break of day had been singing became\r\nmute. The middle of the eclipse was at about 9 a.m.\r\n\r\nIn 1560 an eclipse of the Sun took place which was total in Spain and\r\nPortugal. Clavius who observed it at Coimbra says[90] that \"the Sun\r\nremained obscured for no little time: there was darkness greater than\r\nthat of night, no one could see where he trod and the stars shone very\r\nbrightly in the sky: the birds moreover, wonderful to say, fell down to\r\nthe ground in fright at such startling darkness.\" Kepler is responsible\r\nfor the statement that Tycho Brahe did not believe this, and wrote to\r\nClavius to that effect 40 years afterwards.\r\n\r\nIn 1567 there was an annular eclipse visible at Rome on April 9. Clavius\r\nsays[91] that \"the whole Sun was not eclipsed but that there was left a\r\nbright circle all round.\" This in set terms is a description of an\r\nannular eclipse, but Johnston who calculated that at Rome the greatest\r\nobscuration took place at 20m. past noon points out that the\r\naugmentation of the Moon's semi-diameter would almost have produced\r\ntotality. Tycho tells us that he saw this eclipse on the shores of the\r\nBaltic when a young man about 20 years of age.\r\n\r\nThe total eclipse of February 25, 1598, long left a special mark on the\r\nmemories of the people of Scotland. The day was spoken of as \"Black\r\nSaturday.\" Maclaurin states[92]:--\"There is a tradition that some persons\r\nin the North lost their way in the time of this eclipse, and perished in\r\nthe snow\"--a statement which Hind discredits. The central line passed\r\nfrom near Stranraer, over Dalkeith, and therefore Edinburgh was within\r\nthe zone of totality. Totality came on at Edinburgh at 10h. 15m. and\r\nlasted 1m. 30s. From the rapid motion of the Moon in declination, the\r\ncourse of the central line was a quickly ascending one in latitude on\r\nthe Earth's surface, the totality passing off within the Arctic circle.\r\n\r\nKepler in his account of the new star in the constellation Ophiuchus[93]\r\nrefers to the total eclipse of the Sun of October 12, 1605, as having\r\nbeen observed at Naples, and that the \"Red Flames\" were visible as a rim\r\nof red light round the Sun's disc: at least this seems to be the\r\nconstruction which may fairly be put upon the Latin of the original\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe partial eclipse of the Sun of May 30, 1612, is recorded to have been\r\nseen \"through a tube.\" No doubt this is an allusion to the\r\nnewly-invented instrument which we now call the telescope. Seemingly\r\nthis is the first eclipse of the Sun so observed, but it is on record\r\nthat an eclipse of the Moon had been previously observed through a\r\ntelescope. This was the lunar eclipse of July 6, 1610, though the\r\nobserver's name has not been handed down to us.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of April 8, 1652, is another of those Scotch eclipses, as we\r\nmay call them, which left their mark on the people of that country.\r\nMaclaurin[94] speaks of it in his time (he died in 1746) as one of the\r\ntwo central eclipses which are \"still famous among the populace in this\r\ncountry\" [Scotland], and \"known amongst them by the appellation of Mirk\r\nMonday.\" The central line passed over the S.E. of Ireland, near Wexford\r\nand Wicklow, and reaching Scotland near Burrow Head in Wigtownshire, and\r\npassing not far from Edinburgh, Montrose and Aberdeen, quitted Scotland\r\nat Peterhead. Greenock and Elgin were near the northern limit of the\r\nzone of totality, and the Cheviots and Berwick upon the southern limit.\r\nThe eclipse was observed at Carrickfergus by Dr. Wyberd.[95] Hind found\r\nthat its duration there was but 44s. This short duration, he suggested,\r\nmay partly explain the curious remark of Dr. Wyberd that when the Sun\r\nwas reduced to \"a very slender crescent of light, the Moon all at once\r\nthrew herself within the margin of the solar disc with such agility that\r\nshe seemed to revolve like an upper millstone, affording a pleasant\r\nspectacle of rotatory motion.\" Wyberd's further description clearly\r\napplies to the Corona. A Scotch account says that \"the country people\r\ntilling, loosed their ploughs. The birds dropped to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of November 4, 1668, visible as a partial one in England,\r\nwas of no particular interest in itself but deserves notice as having\r\nbeen observed by Flamsteed,[96] who gives a few diagrams of his\r\nobservations at Derby. He states that the eclipse came on much earlier\r\nthan had been predicted. It was well known at this time that the tables\r\nof the Sun and Moon then in use were very defective, and it was a\r\nrecognition of this fact which eventually led to the foundation of the\r\nGreenwich Observatory in 1675.\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 1699, an eclipse of the Sun occurred which was total to\r\nthe N. of Caithness for the very brief space of 10-15 secs. At\r\nEdinburgh, about 11/12ths of the Sun's diameter was obscured. In the\r\nAppendix to Pepys's _Diary_[97] there is a letter from Dr. Wallis\r\nmentioning that his daughter's attention was called to it by noticing\r\n\"the light of the Sun look somewhat dim\" at about 9 a.m., whilst she\r\nwas writing a letter, she knowing nothing of the eclipse.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the Sun occurred on May 12, 1706, which was visible as a\r\npartial eclipse in England and was total on the Continent, especially in\r\nSwitzerland. A certain Captain Stannyan who made observations at Berne,\r\nwrites thus to Flamsteed[98]:--\"That the Sun was totally darkened there\r\nfor four and a half minutes of time; that a fixed star and a planet\r\nappeared very bright; _and that his getting out of his eclipse was\r\npreceded by a blood-red streak of light from its left limb, which\r\ncontinued not longer than six or seven seconds of time_; then part of\r\nthe Sun's disc appeared all of a sudden as bright as Venus was ever seen\r\nin the night; nay, brighter; and in that very instant gave a light and\r\nshadow to things as strong as the Moon uses to do.\"\r\n\r\nOn this communication Flamsteed remarks:--\"The Captain is the first man I\r\never heard of that took notice of a red streak preceding the emersion of\r\nthe Sun's body from a total eclipse, and I take notice of it to you [the\r\nRoyal Society], because it infers that the Moon has an atmosphere; and\r\nits short continuance, if only six or seven seconds' time, tells us that\r\nits height was not more than five or six hundredths part of her\r\ndiameter.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, perhaps, the most celebrated eclipse of the Sun ever\r\nrecorded in England was that of May 3, 1715. The line of totality passed\r\nright across England from Cornwall to Norfolk, and the phenomenon was\r\ncarefully observed and described by the most experienced astronomer of\r\nthe time, Dr. Edmund Halley. The line of totality passed over London\r\namongst other places, and as the maximum phase took place soon after 9\r\na.m. on a fine spring morning, the inhabitants of the Metropolis saw a\r\nsight which their successors will not see again till many generations\r\nhave come and gone. Halley has left behind him an exceedingly\r\ninteresting account of this event, some allusions to which have already\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\nHe seems to have seen what we call the Corona, described by him however\r\nas a \"luminous ring,\" \"of a pale whiteness, or rather pearl colour, a\r\nlittle tinged with the colours of the Iris, and concentric with the\r\nMoon.\" He speaks also of a dusky but strong red light which seemed to\r\ncolour the dark edge of the Moon just before the Sun emerged from\r\ntotality. Jupiter, Mercury, Venus, and the stars Capella and Aldebaran\r\nwere seen in London, whilst N. of London, more directly under the\r\ncentral line, as many as twenty stars were seen.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of England who lived in the reign of George I. were\r\nsingularly fortunate in their chances of seeing total eclipses of the\r\nSun, for only nine years after[99] the one just described, namely, on\r\nMay 22, 1724, another total eclipse occurred. The central line crossed\r\nsome of the southern countries, and the phenomenon was well seen and\r\nreported on by Dr. Stukeley,[100] who stationed himself on Haraden Hill,\r\nnear Salisbury. The Doctor says of the darkness that he seemed to \"feel\r\nit, as it were, drop upon us ... like a great dark mantle,\" and that\r\nduring the totality the spectacle presented to his view \"was beyond all\r\nthat he had ever seen or could picture to his imagination the most\r\nsolemn.\" He could with difficulty discern the faces of his companions\r\nwhich had a ghastly startling appearance. When the totality was ending\r\nthere appeared a small lucid spot, and from it ran a rim of faint\r\nbrightness. In about 3½ minutes from this appearance the hill-tops\r\nchanged from black to blue, the horizon gave out the grey streaks\r\nprevious to morning dawn, and the birds sprang joyously into the air.\r\n\r\nThis eclipse seems to have had royal observers. It was watched at\r\nKensington apparently by the King or some of the royal family of\r\nEngland, and at Trianon (Paris) by the King of France,[101] under the\r\ncompetent guidance of Maraldi, Cassini and De Louville. It was the last\r\nwhich was visible as a total one in any part of England.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 1733, there was an eclipse of the Sun, which was total in\r\nSweden and partial in England. In Sweden the total obscuration lasted\r\nmore than 3 minutes. Jupiter, the stars in Ursa Major, Capella, and\r\nseveral other stars were visible to the naked eye, as also was a\r\nluminous ring round the Sun. Three or four spots of reddish colour were\r\nalso perceived near the limb of the Moon, but not in immediate contact\r\nwith it. These so-called red \"spots\" were doubtless the Red Flames of\r\nthe present century, and the luminous ring the Corona.\r\n\r\nOn March 1, 1737, a good annular eclipse was observed at Edinburgh by\r\nMaclaurin.[102] In his account he says:--\"A little before the annulus was\r\ncomplete a remarkable point or speck of pale light appeared near the\r\nmiddle of the part of the Moon's circumference that was not yet come\r\nupon the disc of the Sun.... During the appearance of the annulus the\r\ndirect light of the Sun was still very considerable, but the places that\r\nwere shaded from his light appeared gloomy. There was a dusk in the\r\natmosphere, especially towards the N. and E. In those chambers which had\r\nnot their lights westwards the obscurity was considerable. Venus\r\nappeared plainly, and continued visible long after the annulus was\r\ndissolved, and I am told that other stars were seen by some.\" Lord\r\nAberdour mentions a narrow streak of dusky red light on the dark edge of\r\nthe Moon immediately before the ring was completed, and after it was\r\ndissolved. No doubt this is a record of the \"Red Flames.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1748 Scotland was again favoured with a central eclipse, but it was\r\nonly annular. The Earl of Morton[103] and James Short, the optician, who\r\nobserved the phenomenon at Aberdour Castle, 10 miles N.-W. of Edinburgh,\r\njust outside the line of annularity, saw a brown coloured light\r\nstretching along the circumference of the Moon from each of the cusps.\r\nA \"star\" (probably the planet Venus) was seen to the E. of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe annular eclipse of April 1, 1764, visible as such in North Kent, was\r\nthe subject of the following quaint letter by the Rev. Dr. Stukeley:--\r\n\r\n     \"To the Printer of _Whitehall Evening Post_,--\r\n\r\n     \"In regard to the approaching solar eclipse of Sunday, April 1, I\r\n     think it advisable to remark that, it happening in the time of\r\n     divine service, it is desired you would insert this caution in your\r\n     public paper. The eclipse begins soon after 9, the middle a little\r\n     before 11, the end a little after 12. There will be no total\r\n     darkness in the very middle, observable in this metropolis, but as\r\n     people's curiositys will not be over with the middle of the\r\n     eclipse, if the church service be ordered to begin a little before\r\n     12, it will properly be morning prayer, and an uniformity preserved\r\n     in our duty to the Supreme Being, the author of these amazing\r\n     celestial movements,--\r\n     Yours,\r\n                              RECTOR OF ST. GEO., Q.S.\"[104]\r\n\r\nThe year 1766 furnishes the somewhat rare case of a total eclipse of the\r\nSun observed on board ship on the high seas. The observers were officers\r\nof the French man-of-war the _Comte d'Artois_. Though the total\r\nobscuration lasted only 53 secs., there was seen a luminous ring about\r\nthe Moon which had four remarkable expansions, situate at a distance of\r\n90° from each other.[105] These expansions are doubtless those rays\r\nwhich we now speak of as \"streamers\" from the Corona.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough the next important total eclipse deserving of notice\r\nwas also observed at sea. This was the eclipse of June 24, 1778. The\r\nobserver was the Spanish Admiral, Don Antonio Ulloa, who was passing\r\nfrom the Azores to Cape St. Vincent. The total obscuration lasted 4\r\nminutes. The luminous ring presented a very beautiful appearance: out of\r\nit there issued forth rays of light which reached to the distance of a\r\ndiameter of the Moon. Before it became very conspicuous stars of the 1st\r\nand 2nd magnitudes were distinctly visible, but when it attained its\r\ngreatest brilliancy, only stars of the 1st magnitude could be perceived.\r\n\"The darkness was such that persons who were asleep and happened to\r\nwake, thought that they had slept the whole evening and only waked when\r\nthe night was pretty far advanced. The fowls, birds, and other animals\r\non board took their usual position for sleeping, as if it had been\r\nnight.\"[106]\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 5, 1793, there happened an eclipse which, annular to the N. of\r\nScotland, was seen and observed in England by Sir W. Herschel[107] as a\r\npartial eclipse. He made some important observations on the Moon on this\r\noccasion measuring the height of several of the lunar mountains.\r\nConsiderations respecting the shape of one of the Moon's horns led him\r\nto form an opinion adverse to the idea that there the Moon had an\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 79: _Historiarum Sui Temporis_, Lib. iv., cap. 9.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 80: _Historia Novella_, Lib. i., sec. 8.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 81: _Norman Conquest_, vol. v. p. 239.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 82: _Historia Novella_, Lib. ii., sec. 35.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 83: Letter in the _Times_, July 28, 1871.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 84: Rogerus de Wendover, _Flores Historiarum_, vol. ii. p.\r\n    535, Bohn's ed.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 85: _Sugli Eclissi Solari Totali del 3 Giugno 1239, e del\r\n    6 Ottobre 1241_ in the _Memorie del R.

Up to the\r\nbeginning of the 18th century the observations (even the best of them)\r\nmay be said to have been made and recorded with but few exceptions by\r\nunskilled observers with no clear ideas as to what they should look for\r\nand what they might expect to see. Things improved a little during the\r\n18th century and the observations by Halley, Maclaurin, Bradley, Don\r\nAntonio Ulloa, Sir W. Herschel, and others in particular rose to a much\r\nhigher standard than any which had preceded them. However, it has only\r\nbeen during the 19th century, and especially during the latter half of\r\nit, that total eclipses of the Sun have been observed under\r\ncircumstances calculated to extract from them large and solid extensions\r\nof scientific knowledge. Inasmuch as it has been deemed convenient to\r\nsort out and classify our knowledge under particular heads in previous\r\nchapters, I shall in this chapter speak only of the leading facts of\r\neach eclipse in such an outline form as will avoid as far as possible\r\nunnecessary repetition.\r\n\r\nIn 1806 a total eclipse of the Sun occurred, visible in N. America.\r\nObservations made in the United States have been handed down to us. Don\r\nJoachin Ferrer, a Spanish astronomer, observed the eclipse at Kinderhook\r\nin the State of New York. The totality lasted more than 4½ m.--a somewhat\r\nunusual length of time. One or two planets and a few 1st magnitude stars\r\nwere seen. During the totality there was a slight fall of dew.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 19, 1816, there occurred the first total eclipse of the Sun in\r\nthe 19th century, the central line of which passed over Europe. There is\r\nonly one known observation of the total phase, and this was by Hagen at\r\nCulm in Bohemia, but he appears to have seen only the beginning of the\r\ntotality and not the whole of it.\r\n\r\nA partial eclipse of the Sun visible as such in England but which was\r\nannular in the Shetland Isles took place on Sept. 7, 1820. The only\r\nreason why this is worth mention is for its political associations. The\r\ntrial of Queen Caroline was going on in the House of Lords, and the\r\nHouse suspended its sitting for a short time for the sake of the\r\neclipse.\r\n\r\nOn May 15, 1836, there occurred an annular eclipse of the Sun, which\r\nthough it was nowhere total, may be looked upon as the first of the\r\nmodern eclipses the observations of which have taken such a great\r\ndevelopment during recent years. The annularity of this eclipse was\r\nobserved in the N. of England and in the S. of Scotland; and it was at\r\nJedburgh in Roxburghshire that Mr. Francis Baily[108] observed that\r\nfeature of eclipses of the Sun now universally known as \"Baily's Beads.\"\r\nSome indications of the Red Flames were also obtained at places where\r\nthe eclipse was annular.\r\n\r\nProbably it was the recognition of Baily's Beads as a regular\r\nconcomitant of eclipses of the Sun, which helped to pave the way for the\r\nextensive preparations made in France, Italy, Austria, and Russia for\r\nobserving the total eclipse of July 8, 1842. Many of the most eminent\r\nastronomers of Europe repaired to different stations on the central line\r\nin order to see the phenomenon. Amongst these may be named Arago, Valz,\r\nAiry, Carlini, Santini, and O. Struve. The eclipse was witnessed under\r\nfavourable circumstances at all the various stations on the central line\r\nacross Europe, from Perpignan in France in the West to Lipesk in Russia\r\nin the East.\r\n\r\nArago wrote[109] such an exceedingly graphic account of this eclipse\r\nfrom what may be termed the standpoint of the general public, that I\r\nwill quote it at some length, because, with an alteration of date, it\r\nmight be re-written and applied to every total eclipse visible in much\r\npopulated tracts of country.\r\n\r\n\"At Perpignan persons who were seriously unwell alone remained within\r\ndoors. As soon as day began to break the population covered the terraces\r\nand battlements of the town, as well as all the little eminences in the\r\nneighbourhood, in hopes of obtaining a view of the Sun as he ascended\r\nabove the horizon. At the citadel we had under our eyes, besides\r\nnumerous groups of citizens established on the slopes, a body of\r\nsoldiers about to be reviewed.\r\n\r\n\"The hour of the commencement of the eclipse drew nigh. More than twenty\r\nthousand persons, with smoked glasses in their hands, were examining the\r\nradiant globe projected upon an azure sky. Although armed with our\r\npowerful telescopes, we had hardly begun to discern the small notch on\r\nthe western limb of the Sun, when an immense exclamation, formed by the\r\nblending together of twenty thousand different voices, announced to us\r\nthat we had anticipated by only a few seconds the observation made with\r\nthe unaided eye by twenty thousand astronomers equipped for the\r\noccasion, whose first essay this was. A lively curiosity, a spirit of\r\nemulation, the desire of not being outdone, had the privilege of giving\r\nto the natural vision an unusual power of penetration. During the\r\ninterval that elapsed between this moment and the almost total\r\ndisappearance of the Sun we remarked nothing worthy of relation in the\r\ncountenances of so many spectators. But when the Sun, reduced to a very\r\nnarrow filament, began to throw upon the horizon only a very feeble\r\nlight, a sort of uneasiness seized upon all; every person felt a desire\r\nto communicate his impressions to those around him. Hence arose a deep\r\nmurmur, resembling that sent forth by the distant ocean after a tempest.\r\nThe hum of voices increased in intensity as the solar crescent grew more\r\nslender; at length the crescent disappeared, darkness suddenly succeeded\r\nlight, and an absolute silence marked this phase of the eclipse with as\r\ngreat precision as did the pendulum of our astronomical clock. The\r\nphenomenon in its magnificence had triumphed over the petulance of\r\nyouth, over the levity which certain persons assume as a sign of\r\nsuperiority, over the noisy indifference of which soldiers usually make\r\nprofession. A profound stillness also reigned in the air; the birds had\r\nceased to sing. After an interval of solemn expectation, which lasted\r\nabout two minutes, transports of joy, shouts of enthusiastic applause,\r\nsaluted with the same accord, the same spontaneous feeling, the first\r\nreappearance of the rays of the Sun. To a condition of melancholy\r\nproduced by sentiments of an indefinable nature there succeeded a lively\r\nand intelligible feeling of satisfaction which no one sought to escape\r\nfrom or moderate the impulses of. To the majority of the public the\r\nphenomenon had arrived at its term. The other phases of the eclipse had\r\nfew attentive spectators beyond the persons devoted especially to\r\nastronomical pursuits.\"\r\n\r\nThe total eclipse of July 28, 1851, may be said to have been the first\r\nwhich was the subject of an \"Eclipse Expedition,\" a phrase which of late\r\nyears has become exceedingly familiar. The total phase was visible in\r\nNorway and Sweden, and great numbers of astronomers from all parts of\r\nEurope flocked to those countries. Amongst those who went from England\r\nwere Sir G. B. Airy, the Astronomer Royal (then Mr. Airy), Mr. J. R.\r\nHind and Mr. Lassell. The Red Flames were very much in evidence, and the\r\nfact that they belonged to the Sun and not to the Moon was clearly\r\nestablished. Hind mentions that \"the aspect of Nature during the total\r\neclipse was grand beyond description.\" This feature is dwelt upon with\r\nmore than usual emphasis in many of the published accounts. I have never\r\nseen it suggested that the mountainous character of the country may have\r\nhad something to do with it, but that idea would seem not improbable.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1858, two central eclipses of the Sun occurred, both\r\npresenting some features of interest. That of March 15 was annular, the\r\ncentral line passing across England from Lyme Regis in Dorsetshire to\r\nthe Wash, traversing portions of Somersetshire, Wiltshire, Berkshire,\r\nOxfordshire, Northamptonshire, Lincolnshire, and Norfolk. The weather\r\ngenerally was unfavourable and the annular phase was only observed at a\r\nfew places, but important meteorological observations were made and\r\nyielded results, as regards the diminution of temperature, which were\r\nvery definite. All over the country rooks and pigeons were seen\r\nreturning home during the greatest obscuration; starlings in many places\r\ntook flight; at Oxford a thrush commenced its evening song; at Ventnor a\r\nfish in an aquarium, ordinarily visible in the evening only, was in full\r\nactivity about the time of greatest gloom; and generally, it was noted\r\nthat the birds stopped singing and flew low from bush to bush. The\r\ndarkness, though nowhere intense, was everywhere very appreciable and\r\ndecided. The second central eclipse of 1858 took place on September 7\r\nand was observed in Peru by Lieutenant Gilliss of the U.S. Navy. The\r\ntotality only lasted one minute, and the general features of a total\r\neclipse do not appear to have been very conspicuously visible. Gilliss\r\nremarks[110]:--\"Two citizens of Olmos stood within a few feet of me,\r\nwatching in silence, and with anxious countenances, the rapid and\r\nfearful decrease of light. They were wholly ignorant that any sudden\r\neffect would follow the total obscuration of the Sun. At that instant\r\none exclaimed in terror \"_La Gloria_,\" and both, I believe, fell to\r\ntheir knees, filled with awe. They appreciated the resemblance of the\r\nCorona to the halos with which the old masters have encircled their\r\nideals of the heads of our Saviour and the Madonna, and devoutly\r\nregarded this as a manifestation of the Divine Presence.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1860 saw the departure from England of the first great Ship\r\nExpedition to see an eclipse. One was due to happen on July 18, and a\r\nlarge party went out from England to Spain in H.M.S. _Himalaya_. Mr. De\r\nLa Rue took a very well-equipped photographic detachment, and his\r\nphotographs were eminently successful. This eclipse settled for ever the\r\ndoubt as to whether the Red Flames belonged to the Sun or the Moon, and\r\nin favour of the former view.\r\n\r\nThe years 1868, 1869, and 1870 were each marked by total eclipses,\r\nwhich were observed to a greater or less extent. In the first-named year\r\nthe eclipse occurred on August 18, the central line passing across\r\nIndia. The weather was not everywhere favourable, but several\r\nexpeditions were dispatched to the East Indies. The spectroscope was\r\nlargely brought into play with the immediate result of showing that the\r\nCorona was to be deemed a sort of atmosphere of the Sun, not\r\nself-luminous, but shining by reflected light. The eclipse of 1869 was\r\nobserved by several well-equipped parties in the United States, and a\r\nvery complete series of excellent photographs was obtained.\r\n\r\nTo view the eclipse of December 22, 1870, several expeditions were\r\ndispatched, the central line passing over some very accessible places in\r\nSpain, Sicily, and North Africa. The English observers went chiefly in\r\nH.M.S. _Urgent_, though some of them travelled overland to Sicily. The\r\nexpenses, both of the sea and land parties, were to a large extent\r\ndefrayed by Her Majesty's Government. It deserves to be noted that so\r\ngreat was the anxiety of the French astronomer Janssen to see this\r\neclipse, that he determined to try and escape in a balloon from Paris\r\n(then besieged by the Germans) and succeeded, carrying his instruments\r\nwith him. The weather seriously interfered with the work of all the\r\nobservers who went out to see this eclipse, which was the more to be\r\nregretted because the preparations had been on a very extensive and\r\ncostly scale. The chief result was that it was ascertained that the Red\r\nFlames (hence forward generally called \"Prominences\") are composed of\r\nhydrogen gas in an incandescent state.\r\n\r\nThe year 1871 saw, on December 12, another Indian eclipse, noteworthy\r\nfor the numerous and excellent photographs which were obtained of the\r\nCorona, of the rifts in it, and of the general details, which were well\r\nrecorded on the plates.\r\n\r\nThere was an eclipse visible in South Africa on April 16, 1874. Some\r\nuseful naked eye views were obtained and recorded, but as no\r\nphotographic work was done, this eclipse cannot be said to come into\r\nline with those which preceded or followed it.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, that is to say on April 6, 1875, there was a\r\ntotal eclipse of the Sun, visible in the far East, especially Siam; but\r\nthe distance from England, coupled with the very generally unfavourable\r\nweather, prevented this from being anything more than a second-class\r\ntotal eclipse, so to speak, although extensive preparations had been\r\nmade, and the sum of £1000 had been granted by the British Government\r\ntowards the expenses. A certain number of photographs were obtained, but\r\nnone of any very great value.\r\n\r\nPerhaps of the next eclipse which we have to consider, it may be said\r\nthat the circumstances were more varied than those of any other during\r\nthe second half of the 19th century. The eclipse in question occurred on\r\nJuly 29, 1878.\r\n\r\nSeveral favourable circumstances concurred to make it a notable event.\r\nIn the first place, the central line passed entirely across the United\r\nStates; in other words, across a long stretch of inhabited and civilised\r\nterritory, accessible from both sides to a nation well provided with the\r\nrequisite scientific skill and material resources of every kind. But\r\nthere was another special and rare facility available: the central line\r\ncrossed the chain of the Rocky Mountains, an elevated locality, which an\r\nAmerican writer speaks of as overhung by \"skies of such limpid\r\nclearness, that on several evenings Jupiter's satellites were seen with\r\nthe naked eye.\" On the summit of a certain peak, known as Pike's Peak, a\r\nparty of skilled observers, headed by Professor Langley, observed the\r\nwonderful developments of the Corona, mentioned on a previous page. The\r\nfact that such a display came under the eyes of man was no doubt mainly\r\ndue to the superbly clear atmosphere through which the observations were\r\nmade. That this is not a mere supposition may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat at the lower elevation of only 8000 feet, instead of 14,000 feet,\r\nthe Coronal streamers were seen by Professor Newcomb's party, far less\r\nextended than Langley saw them. Perhaps the best proof of the importance\r\nof a diaphanous sky is to be found in the fact that on the summit of\r\nPike's Peak, the Corona remained visible for fully 4 minutes after the\r\ntotal phase had come to an end. A comparison of the descriptions shows\r\nthat even at the elevation of 10,200 ft. the observers placed there,\r\nwhilst they were better off than those at 8000 ft., assuredly did not\r\nsee so much or so well as those at 14,000 ft.\r\n\r\nThere occurred a total eclipse on July 11, 1880, visible in California,\r\nbut as the totality lasted only 32 secs. and the Sun's elevation was\r\nonly 11°, not much was got out of this eclipse notwithstanding that it\r\nwas observed in a cloudless sky at a station 6000 ft. above the sea.\r\n\r\nThe eclipse of May 17, 1882, yielded several interesting and important\r\nfeatures although the totality was short--only about 1¼ minutes. Here\r\nagain favourable local circumstances helped astronomers in more ways\r\nthan one. It was in Egypt that the eclipse was visible, and Egypt is a\r\ncountry which it is exceedingly easy for travellers to reach, and it is\r\nalso noted for its clear skies. These were doubtless two of the reasons\r\nwhich combined to inspire the elaborate preparations which were made for\r\nphotographic and spectroscopic observations. The former resulted in a\r\nvery unprecedented success. One of Dr. Schuster's photographs of the\r\ntotality showed not only the expected Corona, but an unexpected comet.\r\n\r\nThough on more than one previous occasion in history the darkness which\r\nis a special accompaniment of a total eclipse had caused a comet to be\r\nseen, yet the 1882 eclipse was the first at which a comet had thrust\r\nitself upon the notice of astronomers by means of a photographic plate.\r\nIt will be remembered that the political circumstances of Egypt in 1882\r\nwere of a somewhat strained character and probably this contributed to\r\nthe development of an unusual amount of astronomical competition in\r\nconnection with this eclipse. Not only did the Egyptian Government grant\r\nspecial facilities, but strong parties went out representing England,\r\nFrance, and Italy, although not perhaps in set terms at the direct\r\ninstigation of their respective Governments.\r\n\r\nThe next eclipse, that of May 6, 1883, had some dramatic features about\r\nit. To begin with its duration was unusually long--nearly 5½ minutes, and\r\nMrs. Todd in her genial American style remarks:--\"After the frequent\r\nmanner of its kind, the path lay where it would be least useful--across\r\nthe wind-swept wastes of the Pacific. But fortunately one of a small\r\ngroup of coral islands lay quite in its line, and, nothing daunted, the\r\nbrave scientific men set their faces toward this friendly cluster, in\r\ncheerful faith that they could locate there. Directed to take up their\r\nabode somewhere on a diminutive island about which nothing could be\r\nascertained beforehand, save the bare fact of its existence at a known\r\nspot in mid-ocean, the American observers were absent from the United\r\nStates more than three months, most of which time was spent in\r\ntravelling, 15,000 miles in all, with ten full weeks at sea. Their tiny\r\nfoothold in the Pacific was Caroline Island, a coral atoll on the\r\noutskirts of the Marquesas group.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the unattractive, not to say forbidding, character of the\r\nplace to which they would have to go, parties of astronomers went out\r\nfrom England, France, Austria, and Italy, and although rain fell on the\r\nmorning of the day the sky became quite clear by the time of totality\r\nand the observations were completely successful. One of the pictures of\r\nthe Corona obtained by Trouvelot, an observer of French descent, but\r\nbelonging to the American party, has been often reproduced in books and\r\nexhibited the Corona in a striking form. How few were the attractions of\r\nCaroline Island as an eclipse station may be judged from the fact that\r\nthe inhabitants consisted of only four native men, one woman, and two\r\nchildren who lived in three houses and two sheds.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 1885, there occurred a total eclipse, which was seen as\r\nsuch in New Zealand, but the observations were few, and with one\r\nexception, unimportant and uninteresting. A certain Mr. Graydon,\r\nhowever, made a sketch which showed at one point a complete break in the\r\nCorona so that from the very edge of the Moon outwards into space, there\r\nwas a long and narrow black space showing nothing but a vacuity. If this\r\nwas really the condition of things, such a break in the Corona is\r\napparently quite unprecedented.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, on August 29, there occurred a total eclipse, visible in the\r\nWest Indies, which yielded various important results. It was unfortunate\r\nthat for the greater part of its length, the zone of totality covered\r\nocean and not land, the only land being the Island of Grenada and some\r\nadjacent parts of South America. The resulting restriction as regards\r\nchoice of observing stations was the more to be regretted because the\r\nduration of the totality was so unusually long, and therefore\r\nfavourable, being more than 6½ minutes in the middle of the Atlantic\r\nOcean. Parties of English, American, and Italian astronomers assembled,\r\nhowever, at Grenada, and though the weather was not the best possible,\r\nsome interesting photographs were obtained which exhibited an unusual\r\ndevelopment of hydrogen protuberances. The central line in this eclipse\r\nnot only stretched right across the Atlantic, but entered Africa on the\r\nWest Coast where a missionary saw the eclipse as a mere spectator, and\r\nafterwards expressed his regret that no astronomers were within reach\r\nwith instruments to record the remarkable Corona which was displayed to\r\nhis gaze.\r\n\r\nThough the unusual opportunities which, so far as the Sun and the Moon\r\nwere concerned, were afforded by the eclipse of 1886 were lost,\r\nastronomers looked out hopefully for August 19, 1887, when another\r\neclipse was due to happen which, weather permitting, would be observable\r\nover a very long stretch of land, from Berlin through Russia and Siberia\r\nto Japan. Unusually extensive preparations were made in Russia at one\r\nend and in Japan at the other, but clouds prevailed very generally, and\r\nthe pictures of the Corona which were obtained fell far short in number\r\nand quality from what had been hoped for, having regard to the number\r\nand importance of the stations chosen, and of the astronomers who made\r\ntheir preparations thereat. An enthusiastic Russian, in the hopes of\r\nemancipating himself from the risks of terrestrial weather at the\r\nEarth's surface, went up in a balloon to an elevation of more than two\r\nmiles. His enthusiasm was so far rewarded that he had a very clear view\r\nof a magnificent Corona; but as, owing to some mischance, the balloon\r\nrose, conveying only the astronomer and leaving behind his assistant who\r\nwas to have managed the balloon, all his time was engrossed by the\r\nmanagement of the balloon, and he could do very little in the way of\r\npurely astronomical work.\r\n\r\nThe year 1889 afforded two total eclipses of the Sun for which the usual\r\npreparations were made. The first occurred on New Year's Day, and the\r\npath of the shadow crossed the North American Continent from California\r\nto Manitoba. The weather was nearly everywhere very favourable, and an\r\nenormous number of observers and instruments were assembled along the\r\ncentral line. The consequence was that a very large number of\r\nphotographs were obtained. It may be said generally of this eclipse,\r\nthat as it coincided with a Sun-spot minimum, it left us in a position\r\nto learn very distinctly what are the characteristic features of a solar\r\nCorona at a period which is one of rest and repose on the Sun, at least,\r\nso far as regards visible Sun-spots.\r\n\r\nThe second eclipse of 1889 occurred on December 22, and should have been\r\nvisible off the northern coast of South America and on the West Coast of\r\nAfrica. Attempts were made to utilise the South American chances by\r\nEnglish and American parties, whilst a small expedition comprising\r\nastronomers of both nations went to Cape Ledo in West Africa. The\r\nAfrican efforts failed entirely owing to clouds, but the South American\r\nparties at Cayenne were successful. One very deplorable result, however,\r\narising out of the expedition to Cayenne was the illness and subsequent\r\ndeath of the Rev. S. J. Perry, S.J., who was struck down by malaria and\r\ndied at sea on the return journey. None who knew Mr. Perry personally\r\ncould fail to realise what a loss he was both to astronomy generally and\r\nto his own circle of friends particularly.\r\n\r\nOn April 16, 1893, there happened a total eclipse of the Sun, which was\r\nsuccessfully watched by a large number of skilled observers throughout\r\nits entire length. Indeed it is believed that only one party was\r\nunsuccessful. The line of totality started on the coast of Chili, passed\r\nover the highlands of that country, across the borders of Argentina and\r\nParaguay, and over the vast plains and forests of Central Brazil,\r\nemerging at about noon of local time at a short distance to the N.-W. of\r\nCeara on the North Atlantic seaboard. Crossing the Atlantic nearly at\r\nits narrowest part, it struck the coast of Africa N. of the river\r\nGambia, and finally disappeared somewhere in the Sahara. The South\r\nAmerican observations were the most extensive and successful, the latter\r\nfact being due to the circumstance that the sky at many of the principal\r\nstations was pre-eminently favourable, owing to the clearness and\r\ndryness of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 29, 1894, there was a total eclipse of the Sun, but as its\r\nduration was brief and the zone of totality lay chiefly over the Indian\r\nOcean, practically nothing came of it.\r\n\r\nThings seemed, however, much more promising for the total eclipse of\r\nAug. 9, 1896, and a very large number of observers went out to the North\r\nof Norway hoping to catch the shadow at its European end, whilst a\r\nyacht party went to Nova Zembla in the Arctic Ocean, and a few observers\r\ntravelled as far as Japan. So far as the very large number of would-be\r\nobservers who went from England to Norway were concerned, the eclipse\r\nwas a profound disappointment, for owing to bad weather practically\r\nnothing was seen in Norway except on the West coast near Bodö, where the\r\nweather was beautifully fine, but where no adequate preparations had\r\nbeen made, because nobody believed that the coast would be free from\r\nfog. Exceptionally fine weather prevailed at Nova Zembla, and the small\r\nbut select party who were kindly taken there by the late Sir G. B.\r\nPowell, M.P., in his yacht, were very fortunate, and an excellent series\r\nof photographs was secured. One important result obtained at Nova Zembla\r\nwas a full confirmation by Mr. Shackleton of Prof. Young's discovery in\r\n1870 of the \"Reversing Layer,\" a discovery which was long and vehemently\r\ndisputed by Sir Norman Lockyer. Fairly successful observations were made\r\nof this eclipse in Siberia and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe last total eclipse of the Sun which has to be noticed as an\r\naccomplished fact was the \"Indian Eclipse\" of Jan. 22, 1898, which was\r\nvery successfully seen by large numbers of people who went to India from\r\nall parts of the world. As usual in all total eclipses of the Sun\r\nnowadays, the photographers were very much to the front, and the\r\nphotographs of the inner Corona, taken by the Astronomer Royal, are\r\nthought to have been probably the best that have yet been done. Amongst\r\nthe miscellaneous observations made, it may be mentioned that more stars\r\nwere seen during the second partial phases than during totality (a\r\ncircumstance which had been noticed by Don A. Ulloa as far back as\r\n1778). It is stated also that a mysterious object was seen between Mars\r\nand Venus by two officers of H.M.S. _Melpomene_, which was not put down\r\non the published chart as a star to be looked for. The identity of this\r\nobject has not been ascertained.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 108: _Memoirs_, R.A.S., vol. x. p. 5.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 109: _L'Annuaire_, 1846, p. 303.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 110: _Month.

As it is not likely that\r\nthis little book will fall into the hands of any persons who would be\r\nable to make much use of telegraphy in connection with eclipse\r\nobservations, it will not be necessary to give much space to the matter,\r\nbut a few outlines will certainly be interesting. When the idea of\r\nutilising the telegraph wire first came into men's minds, it was with\r\nthe object of enabling observers who saw the commencement of an eclipse\r\nat one end of the line of totality, to give cautionary notices to\r\nobservers farther on, or towards the far end, of special points which\r\nhad been seen at the beginning of the totality, and as to which\r\nconfirmatory observations, at a later hour, were evidently very\r\ndesirable. It is obvious that a scheme of this kind depends for its\r\nsuccess upon each end (or something like it) of the line of totality\r\nbeing in telegraphic communication with the other end, and this involves\r\na combination of favourable circumstances not likely to exist at every\r\noccurrence of a total eclipse, and in general only likely to prevail in\r\nthe case of eclipses visible over inhabited territory, such as the two\r\nAmericas, Europe, and parts of Asia. This use of the telegraph was, I\r\nthink, first proposed as far back as 1878, by an American astronomer, in\r\nconnection with the total eclipse of that year. His proposal fell upon\r\nsympathetic ears, with the result that arrangements were concluded with\r\nthe Western Union Telegraph Company of North America for the expeditious\r\nforwarding of messages from northern stations on the eclipse line to\r\nsouthern stations. Some attention was being given at that time to the\r\nquestion of Intra-Mercurial planets, and it was thought that if by good\r\nfortune any such objects were unexpectedly found at the northern\r\nstation, and observers at a southern station could be advised of the\r\nfact, there might be a better chance of procuring an accurate and\r\nprecise record of the discovery. As it happened, nothing came of it on\r\nthat occasion, but the idea of utilising the telegraph having once taken\r\npossession of men's minds, it was soon seen what important possibilities\r\nwere opened up.\r\n\r\nThe want of telegraph organisation curiously made itself felt in the\r\nEgyptian eclipse of 1882. It is stated in another chapter of this work\r\nthat during the total phase a comet was unexpectedly discovered. Now\r\ncomets sometimes move very rapidly (especially when they are near the\r\nSun), and had it been possible to have warned some observer to the E. of\r\nEgypt to look out for this comet, and had he seen it even only a couple\r\nof hours after it had been found in Egypt, some data respecting its\r\nposition might have been obtained which would have permitted a rough\r\nestimate being formed of its movement through the heavens. Such an\r\nestimate might have enabled astronomers to have hunted up the comet at\r\nsunset or sunrise on the days immediately following the eclipse. As it\r\nhappened, however, the comet was not seen again in 1882, and, so far as\r\nwe know, may never be seen again.\r\n\r\nIt was not till 1889 that a complete organisation of a telegraph service\r\nin connection with an eclipse was accomplished. The eclipse of January 1\r\nof that year began in the Pacific and the line of totality touched land\r\nin California, passing across North America to Manitoba. The first\r\nCalifornian station was at Willows, and was occupied by a party from\r\nHarvard College Observatory, who were supplied with an unusually\r\ncomplete equipment of photographic apparatus, together with a large\r\ncamera for charting all the stars in the neighbourhood of the Sun, so as\r\nto detect an Intra-Mercurial planet if one existed. The telegraph scheme\r\nwhich had to be worked out was somewhat complicated, and one of the\r\nchief actors in the scene has furnished a fairly full account of what\r\nwas done. First of all, a complete list of the instruments and of the\r\nwork proposed to be done by them had to be prepared. The weather\r\nprobabilities being everywhere very unsatisfactory, there was a\r\npossibility of all degrees of success or failure, and one thing which\r\nhad to be prearranged for each station was a cypher code which should be\r\navailable for all the likely combinations of instruments, weather and\r\nresults. It was found that about one hundred words would suffice for the\r\nnecessary code, including words which would indicate in a sufficiently\r\nprecise manner the position of any new planet which a photograph might\r\ndisclose.\r\n\r\nThe following, being a part of the code prescribed for use at Willows,\r\nwill serve to indicate the nature of the whole scheme:--\r\n\r\n_Africa_,  Perfectly clear throughout the whole eclipse.\r\n_Alaska_,  Perfectly clear during totality.\r\n_Belgium_, Clear sky for the partial phases, but cloudy for totality.\r\n_Bolivia_, Entirely cloudy throughout the whole eclipse.\r\n_Brazil_,  Observed all the contacts.\r\n_Bremen_,  Observed three of the contacts.\r\n_Ceylon_,  Made observations on the shadow-bands.\r\n_Chili_,   Observed lines of the reversing layer visually.\r\n_China_,   The Corona showed great detail.\r\n_Cork_,    Obtained 40-50 negatives during totality.\r\n_Corsica_, Obtained 50-60 negatives during totality.\r\n_Crimea_,  Obtained 60-70 negatives during totality.\r\n_Cuba_,    Observed a comet.\r\n\r\nUpwards of twenty codes were prepared for the like number of stations,\r\nand the observers were to report their results at the earliest possible\r\nmoment. On a rehearsal of the programme the thought occurred that the\r\nsending and reception of so many cypher messages in the ordinary course\r\nof business might lead to delays which would be productive of serious\r\ninconvenience, and that the success of the whole scheme could be only\r\nwell assured if a special wire, in direct circuit from New York to the\r\neclipse stations in turn, could be dedicated to the work. Thanks to the\r\nliberality of the Western Union Telegraph Company this privilege was\r\nsecured, and a branch wire was led across from the Company's New York\r\noffice to the office of the _New York Herald_, which journal had\r\nundertaken to be responsible for the non-astronomical part of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nMrs. Todd gives the following account of the final arrangements, and of\r\nhow they began to work when the moment for action arrived:--\"From San\r\nFrancisco every California observer was within easy telegraphic reach,\r\nand the wire thus extended by direct circuit to each eclipse station in\r\nturn. From the editorial rooms of the _Herald_ Professor Todd was in\r\nimmediate communication with any observers whom he chose to call. As\r\npreviously intimated, arrangements had been made with the Harvard\r\nastronomers at Willows to receive their message first and with the\r\nutmost despatch, in order to test the feasibility of outstripping the\r\nMoon. Shortly before 5 o'clock in the afternoon despatches began to come\r\nin. Of course a slight delay was unavoidable, as the observers at the\r\nvarious stations were some rods distant from the local telegraph\r\noffices, and it would take a few minutes after the eclipse was over to\r\nprepare the suitable message from the cypher code. On the astronomer's\r\ntable in the _Herald_ office were a large map and a chronometer. The\r\nlatter indicated exact Greenwich time, and the former showed the correct\r\nposition of the Moon's shadow at the beginning of every minute by the\r\nchronometer. In this way it was possible to follow readily the precise\r\nphase of the eclipse at every station. About the rooms and accessible\r\nfor immediate use were arranged the cypher codes pertaining to the\r\nseveral stations and other papers necessary in preparing the reports for\r\nthe press. Everything being, as was supposed, in working order, New York\r\nabout a quarter of an hour before totality commenced inquired of Willows\r\nthe state of the weather. The answer was that the sky was getting dark,\r\nand that there were no clouds anywhere near the Sun. At that time the\r\nMoon's shadow was travelling across the open waters of the Pacific. It\r\nrapidly rushed along; totality came and went at Willows; a two minutes'\r\nglimpse of the Corona was had, and the Corona swept rapidly eastwards.\r\nAfter a brief interval Professor Pickering sent off from Willows a\r\ntelegram which began--\"_Alaska_, _China_, _Corsica_,\" and then the\r\nconnection failed. The break was located somewhere between California\r\nand Utah, and more than half an hour elapsed ere the circuit was\r\nre-established, and the rest of the message received. The remainder of\r\nthe thrilling incidents of that eventful day cannot possibly be better\r\ntold than in Mrs. Todd's crisp and striking language[111]:--\r\n\r\n\"During this interval the lunar shadow, advancing over Montana and\r\nDakota, had left the Earth entirely, sweeping off again into space.\r\nStill, however, the prospect that the telegraph might win the race was\r\nhopeful. Had New York been located in the eclipse path as well as\r\nWillows, with both stations symmetrically placed, the total eclipse\r\nwould have become visible at New York about an hour and a quarter after\r\nthe shadow had left California. Thus there was time to spare. Having\r\nrecovered the wire, Professor Pickering's message was completed at\r\n10h. 36m. [G.M.T.], the cypher translated, and the stenographer's notes\r\nwere written out and despatched to the composing-room six minutes later.\r\nThe \"copy\" was quickly put in type, and the hurried proof handed to\r\nProfessor Todd at 10h. 50m., exactly an hour of absolute time after the\r\nobservations were concluded. Had the Moon's shadow been advancing from\r\nCalifornia toward New York, there was still a margin of several minutes\r\nbefore the eclipse could become total at the latter place. In point of\r\nfact, while the proof sheet of the first message was being read, the\r\nlunar shadow would have been loitering among the Alleghanies. Man's\r\nmessenger had thus outrun the Moon. The telegraphic reports of the other\r\nastronomers were gradually gathered and put in type, and the forms of\r\nthe _Herald_ were ready for the stereotyper at the proper time, some\r\ntwo hours after midnight. At 3 o'clock a.m. the European mails closed,\r\nand the pouches put on board the steamship _Aller_ carried the usual\r\ncopies for the foreign circulation. Within twenty-four hours after the\r\nobservations of the eclipse were made near the Pacific coast, the\r\nresults had been telegraphed to the Atlantic seaboard, collected and\r\nprinted, and the papers were well out on their journey to European\r\nreaders.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing narrative will make amply clear the future possibilities\r\nof telegraphy as a coadjutor of Astronomy in the observation of total\r\neclipses of the Sun. And if the will and the funds are forthcoming, the\r\neclipse of May 28, 1900, will afford an excellent opportunity of again\r\nputting to the test the excellent ideas of which our American friends\r\nworked out so successfully ten years ago. The zone of totality in that\r\neclipse passing as it will through so many of the densely populated\r\nSouthern States of North America, and then through Portugal, Spain, and\r\nAlgiers, great facilities will present themselves for telegraphic\r\ncombinations, if political and financial difficulties do not interfere.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 111: There is a want of uniformity in Mrs. Todd's\r\n    references to times which I have not thought it necessary to put\r\n    straight. \"Greenwich Mean Time,\" \"Eastern U.S. Standard Time,\" and\r\n    \"Pacific Time,\" are all severally quoted in happy-go-lucky\r\n    confusion.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n               ECLIPSES OF THE MOON--GENERAL PRINCIPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn dealing with eclipses generally, but with more especial reference to\r\neclipses of the Sun, in a previous chapter, it was unavoidable to mix\r\nup in some degree eclipses of the Moon with those of the Sun. There\r\nare, however, distinctions between the two phenomena which make it\r\nconvenient to separate them as much as possible. Eclipses of the Moon\r\nare, like those of the Sun, divisible into \"partial\" and \"total\"\r\neclipses, but those words have a different application in regard to\r\neclipses of the Moon from what they have when eclipses of the Sun are in\r\nquestion. A little thought will soon make it clear why this should be\r\nthe case. A partial eclipse of the Sun results from the visible body of\r\nthe Sun being in part concealed from us by the solid body of the Moon,\r\nand so in a total eclipse there is total concealment of the one object\r\nby the other.\r\n\r\nBut when we come to deal with partial and total eclipses of the Moon,\r\nthe situation, is materially different. The Moon becomes invisible by\r\npassing into the dark shadow cast by the Earth into space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--THEORY OF AN ECLIPSE OF THE MOON.]\r\n\r\nFig. 13 will make this clear without the necessity of much verbal\r\nexplanation. S represents the Sun, E the Earth, and _mn_ the orbit of\r\nthe Moon. It is obvious that whilst the Moon is moving from _m_ to _n_\r\nit becomes immersed in the Earth's shadow. But before actually reaching\r\nthe shadow the Moon passes through a point in its orbit at which it\r\nbegins to lose the full light of the Sun. This is the entrance into the\r\n\"penumbra\" (or \"Partial shade\"). Similarly, after the eclipse, when the\r\nMoon has emerged from the full shadow it does not all at once come into\r\nfull sunshine, but again passes through the stage of penumbral\r\nillumination,[112] and under such circumstances (to speak in the style\r\nof Old \"Oireland\") the invisible Moon is very often not invisible, and\r\nthe part partially eclipsed is often not eclipsed, and when the Moon is\r\ntotally eclipsed it is frequently still visible. Of course the general\r\nidea involved in all cases of a body passing into the shadow of another\r\nbody is that the body which so passes disappears, because all direct\r\nlight is cut off from it. In the case, however, of a lunar eclipse this\r\nstate of things is not always literally accomplished, and very often\r\nsome residual light reaches the Moon (of course from the Sun) with the\r\nresult that traces of the Moon may often be discerned. The laws which\r\ngovern this matter are very ill-understood. The fact remains that if we\r\nexamine a series of reports of observed eclipses of the Moon extending\r\nover many centuries (and records exist which enable us to do this) we\r\nshall find that in some instances when the Moon was \"totally\" eclipsed\r\nin the technical sense of that word, it was still perfectly visible,\r\nwhilst during other eclipses it absolutely and entirely disappeared from\r\nview. Such eclipses are sometimes spoken of as \"black\" eclipses of the\r\nMoon, but the phrase is not a happy one. Many instances of both kinds\r\nwill be found mentioned in the chapter on historical lunar\r\neclipses.[113]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--CONDITIONS OF ECLIPSES OF THE MOON.]\r\n\r\nThe different conditions of eclipses of the Moon are illustrated by Fig.\r\n14 which must be studied with the aid of the remarks made in a former\r\nchapter concerning the apparent movements of the Sun and Moon and their\r\nnodal passages. Suffice it to state here that in Fig. 14 AB represents\r\nthe ecliptic, and CD the Moon's path. The three black circles are\r\nimaginary sections of the Earth's shadow as cast when the Earth is in\r\nthree successive positions in the ecliptic. If when the Earth's shadow\r\nis near A the Moon should be at E, and in Conjunction with the Earth\r\nthe Moon will escape eclipse; if the Conjunction takes place with both\r\nthe Earth's shadow and the Moon a little further forward, say at F, the\r\nMoon will be partially obscured; but if the Moon is at or very near its\r\nnode, as at G, it will be wholly involved in the Earth's shadow and a\r\ntotal eclipse will be the result. In the case contemplated at G in the\r\ndiagram, the Moon is concentrically placed with respect to the shadow,\r\nbut the eclipse will equally be total even though the two bodies are not\r\nconcentrically disposed, so long as the Moon is wholly within the cone\r\nof the Earth's shadow.[114]\r\n\r\nJust as in the case of the Sun so with the Moon there are certain limits\r\non the ecliptic within which eclipses of the Moon _may_ take place,\r\nother (narrower) limits within which they _must_ take place, and again\r\nother limits beyond which they _cannot_ take place. Reverting to what\r\nhas been said on a previous page[115] with respect to these matters when\r\nan eclipse of the Sun is in question it is only necessary to substitute\r\nfor the word \"Conjunction,\" the word \"Opposition\"; and for 18½° and 15¼°\r\nof longitude the figures 12½° and 9¼°. The limits in latitude will be\r\n1° 3' and 0° 52' instead of 1° 34' and 1° 23'. These substitutions\r\nmade, the general ideas and facts stated with regard to the conditions\r\nof an eclipse of the Sun will apply also to the one of the Moon.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that whereas eclipses of the Sun always begin on the\r\nW. side of the Sun, eclipses of the Moon begin on the E. side of the\r\nMoon. This difference arises from the fact that the Sun's movement in\r\nthe ecliptic is only apparent (it being the Earth which really moves),\r\nwhilst the Moon's movement is real.\r\n\r\nEclipses of the Moon, though more often and more widely visible than\r\neclipses of the Sun, do not offer by any means the same variety of\r\ninteresting or striking phenomena to the mere star-gazer, and it was\r\nlong thought that they were in a certain sense of no use to science.\r\nNow, however, astronomers are inclined to utilise them for determining\r\nthe diameter of the Moon by noting occultations[116] of stars by the\r\nMoon, the duration of a star's invisibility behind an eclipsed Moon\r\nbeing a measure of the lunar diameter when such an observation is\r\nproperly transformed and \"reduced.\" Observations of the heat radiated\r\n(or rather reflected) by an eclipsed Moon have also been made with the\r\ninteresting result of showing that during an eclipse the Moon's power to\r\nreflect solar heat to the Earth sensibly declines.\r\n\r\nThe duration of an eclipse of the Moon is dependent on its magnitude.\r\nWhere the eclipse is total the darkness, or what counts for such, may\r\nlast for nearly 4 hours, though this is an extreme limit rarely\r\nattained. An eclipse of from 6 to 12 digits (to use the old-fashioned\r\nnomenclature which has been already explained) will continue from 2½ to\r\n3½ hours. An eclipse of 3 to 6 digits will last 2 or 3 hours, and a\r\nsmaller eclipse only 1 or 2 hours. The visual observations to be made in\r\nconnection with partial or total eclipses of the Moon chiefly relate to\r\nthe appearances presented by our satellite when immersed in the Earth's\r\nshadow. On such occasions, as has been already stated, it frequently\r\nhappens that the Moon does not wholly disappear, but may be detected\r\neither with a telescope or even without one. It may exhibit either a\r\ndull grey appearance, or more commonly a pinkish-red hue to which the\r\ndesignation \"coppery\" is generally applied. Perhaps the most remarkable\r\ninstance of this was the eclipse of March 19, 1848.\r\n\r\nMr. Forster who observed the phenomenon at Bruges thus describes[117]\r\nwhat he saw:--\"I wish to call your attention to the fact which I have\r\nclearly ascertained, that during the whole of the late eclipse of March\r\n19 the shaded surface presented a luminosity quite unusual, probably\r\nabout three times the intensity of the mean illumination of the eclipsed\r\nlunar disc. The light was of a deep red colour. During the totality of\r\nthe eclipse the light and dark places on the face of the Moon could be\r\nalmost as well made out as on an ordinary dull moonlight night, and the\r\ndeep red colour where the sky was clearer was very remarkable from the\r\ncontrasted whiteness of the stars. My observations were made with\r\ndifferent telescopes, but all presented the same appearance, and the\r\nremarkable luminosity struck everyone. The British Consul at Ghent, _who\r\ndid not know there was an eclipse_, wrote to me for an explanation of\r\nthe blood-red colour[118] of the Moon at 9 o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to this stands the total eclipse of Oct. 4, 1884,\r\nwhich is described by Mr. E. J. Stone[119] as \"much the darkest that I\r\nhave ever seen, and just before the instant of totality it appeared as\r\nif the Moon's surface would be invisible to the naked eye during\r\ntotality; but such was not the case, for with the last appearance of the\r\nbright reflected sunlight there appeared a dim circle of light around\r\nthe Moon's disc, and the whole surface became faintly visible, and\r\ncontinued so until the end of totality.\"\r\n\r\nA total eclipse of the Moon which happened on January 28, 1888, was\r\nobserved in many places under exceptionally favourable circumstances as\r\nregards weather. The familiar copper colour is spoken of by many\r\nobservers. The Rev. S. J. Perry makes mention[120] of patches of colour\r\neven as bright as \"brick red, almost orange in the brighter parts,\" and\r\nthis, 20 minutes before the total phase began. Mr. Perry conducted on\r\nthis occasion spectroscopic observations for the first time on an\r\neclipsed Moon, but no special results were obtained.\r\n\r\nVarious explanations have been offered for these diversities of\r\nappearance. Undoubtedly they depend upon differences in the condition of\r\nthe Earth's atmosphere, such as the unusual presence or unusual absence\r\nof aqueous vapour; but it cannot be said that the laws which control\r\nthese diversities are by any means capable of being plainly enunciated,\r\nnotwithstanding that the explanation generally in vogue dates from as\r\nfar back as the time of Kepler. He suggested that the coppery hue was a\r\nresult of the refraction of the Earth's atmosphere which had the effect\r\nof bending the solar rays passing through it, so that they impinged upon\r\nthe Moon even when the Earth was actually interposed between the Sun and\r\nthe Moon. That the outstanding rays which became visible are red may be\r\nconsidered due to the fact that the blue rays are absorbed in passing\r\nthrough the terrestrial atmosphere, just as both the eastern and western\r\nskies are frequently seen to assume a ruddy hue when illuminated in the\r\nmorning or evening by the solar rays at or near sunrise or sunset.\r\n\r\nOwing to the variable meteorological condition of our atmosphere, the\r\nactual quantity of light transmitted through it is liable to\r\nconsiderable fluctuations, and no wonder therefore that variations occur\r\nin the appearances presented by the Moon during her immersion in the\r\nEarth's shadow.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that if the portion of the Earth's atmosphere\r\nthrough which the Sun's rays have to pass is tolerably free from aqueous\r\nvapour, the red rays will be almost wholly absorbed, but not the blue\r\nrays; and the resulting illumination will either only render the Moon's\r\nsurface visible with a greyish blue tinge, or not visible at all. This\r\nwill yield the \"black eclipse\"--to recall the phrase quoted elsewhere.\r\nIf, on the other hand, the region of the Earth's atmosphere through\r\nwhich the Sun's rays pass be highly saturated, it will be the blue rays\r\nwhich suffer absorption, whilst the red rays will be transmitted and\r\nwill impart a ruddy hue to the Moon. Finally, if the Earth's atmosphere\r\nis in a different condition in different places, saturated in some parts\r\nand not in others, a piebald sort of effect will be the result, and some\r\nportions of the Moon's disc will be invisible, whilst others will be\r\nmore or less illuminated. Further illustrations of all these three\r\nalternatives will be found amongst the eclipses of the Moon recorded in\r\nthe chapter[121] devoted to historical matters.\r\n\r\nA few instances are on record of a curious spectacle connected with\r\neclipses of the Moon which must have a word of mention. I refer to the\r\nsimultaneous visibility of the Sun and the Moon above the horizon, the\r\nMoon at the time being eclipsed. At the first blush of the thing this\r\nwould seem to be an impossibility, remembering that it is a cardinal\r\nprinciple of eclipses, both of the Sun and of the Moon, that the three\r\nbodies must be in the same straight line in order to constitute an\r\neclipse. The anomalous spectacle just referred to is simply the result\r\nof the refraction exercised by the Earth's atmosphere. The setting Sun\r\nwhich has actually set has apparently not done so, but is displaced\r\nupwards by refraction. On the other hand, the rising Moon which has not\r\nactually risen is displaced upwards by refraction and so becomes, as it\r\nwere, prematurely visible. In other words, refraction retards the\r\napparent setting of one body, the Sun, and accelerates the apparent\r\nrising of the other body, the Moon. The effect of these two\r\ndisplacements will be to bring the two bodies closer by more than 1° of\r\na great circle than they really are, this being the conjoint amount of\r\nthe double displacements due to refraction.\r\n\r\nAmateur observers of eclipses of the Moon will find some pleasure, and\r\nprofit as well, in having before them on the occasion of an eclipse a\r\npicture of the Moon's surface in diagrammatic form with a few of the\r\nprincipal mountains marked thereon; and then watching from time to time\r\n(say by quarters of an hour) the successive encroachments of the Earth's\r\nshadow on the Moon's surface and the gradual covering up of the larger\r\nmountains as the shadow moves forward. The curved lines represent the\r\ngradual progress of the shadow during the eclipse named. This diagram,\r\nignoring the curved lines actually marked on it, may be used over and\r\nover again for any number of eclipses, simply noting from the _Nautical\r\nAlmanac_ or other suitable ephemerides the points on the Moon's disc at\r\nwhich the shadow first touches the disc as it comes on, and last touches\r\nthe disc as it goes off. The _Almanac_ indicates these points by\r\nstating that the eclipse begins, or ends, as the case may be, at a point\r\nwhich is so many degrees from the N. point of the Moon measured round\r\nthe Moon's circumference by the E. or by the W. as the case may be.\r\n\r\nOne other point and we have disposed of eclipses of the Moon. The shadow\r\nwhich we see creeping over the Moon during an eclipse is, as we know,\r\nthe shadow cast by the Earth. If we notice it attentively we shall see\r\nthat its outline is curved, and that it is in fact a complete segment of\r\na circle. Moreover that the circularity of this shadow is maintained\r\nfrom first to last so far as we are able to follow it. What is this,\r\nthen, but a proof of the rotundity of the earth? This shape of the\r\nEarth's shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse was suggested as a\r\nproof of the rotundity of the Earth by two old Greek astronomers,\r\nManilius and Cleomedes, who lived about 2000 years ago, and is one more\r\nillustration of the great powers of observation and the general\r\nacuteness of the natural philosophers of antiquity.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 112: The time occupied by the Moon in passing through the\r\n    penumbra, before and after a lunar eclipse, will generally run to\r\n    about an hour for each passage. It will occasionally happen that the\r\n    Moon gets immersed in a penumbra but escapes the dark shadow. Such\r\n    an event will not be announced in the almanacs under the head of\r\n    \"Eclipses.\"]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 113: See p. 197 (_post_).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 114: The shadow is spoken of as being in the form of a\r\n    cone because it is necessarily such on account of the light-giving\r\n    disc of the Sun being so enormously larger in diameter than the\r\n    light-receiving sphere of the Moon. This idea can be pursued by any\r\n    reader with the aid of a lamp enclosed in a glass globe and an\r\n    opaque sphere such as a cricket ball.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 115: See p. 19 (_ante_).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 116: As to occultations see chap. xxi.

It must now be stated that the same remark\r\napplies to the first recorded eclipse of the Moon, and Prof. S. M.\r\nRussell is again our authority. He refers to a book called the\r\n_Chou-Shu_ or book of the Chou Dynasty, said to have been found in 280\r\nA.D. in the tomb of an Emperor who lived many centuries previously. In\r\nthis book it is stated that in the 35th year of Wen-Wang on the day\r\nPing-Tzu there was an eclipse of the Moon. Russell finds that this event\r\nmay be assigned to January 29, 1136 B.C., and that the eclipse was\r\ntotal.\r\n\r\nNext after this Chinese eclipse, in point of time, come several eclipses\r\nrecorded by Ptolemy, on the authority of records collected or examined\r\nby himself. The three earliest of these came from Chaldæan sources.\r\n\r\nThe first of these eclipses was observed at Babylon, in the 27th year of\r\nthe era of Nabonassar, the 1st of the reign of Mardokempadius, on the\r\n29th of the Egyptian month Thoth, answering to March 19, 721 B.C. The\r\neclipse began before moonrise, and the middle of the totality appears to\r\nhave occurred at 9h. 30m. p.m. The other two eclipses, also observed at\r\nBabylon, occurred on March 8, 720 B.C., and September 1, in the same\r\nyear, respectively.\r\n\r\nThree other lunar eclipses, recorded by Ptolemy, assisted Sir I. Newton\r\nin fixing the _Terminus a quo_ from which the \"70 weeks\" of years were\r\nto run which the prophet Daniel[122] predicted were to elapse before the\r\ndeath of Christ. This _Terminus a quo_ dates from the Restoration of the\r\nJews under Artaxerxes, 457 B.C. The three eclipses which Newton made\r\nuse of were those of July 16, 523, November 19, 502, and April 25, 491\r\nB.C.\r\n\r\nAristophanes, in \"The Clouds\" (lines 561-66), makes an allusion to which\r\nhas been supposed (but probably without adequate warrant, in Spanheim's\r\nopinion), to refer to an eclipse of the Moon. The eclipse, October 9,\r\n425 B.C., has, moreover, been suggested as that referred to, but the\r\nwhole idea seems to me too shadowy.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the Moon took place in the 4th year of the 91st Olympiad,\r\nanswering to August 27, 413 B.C., which produced very disastrous\r\nconsequences to an Athenian army, owing to the ignorance and incapacity\r\nof Nicias, the commander. The army was in Sicily, confronted by a\r\nSyracusan army, and having failed, more or less, and sickness having\r\nbroken out, it was decided that the Athenians should embark and quit the\r\nisland. Plutarch, in his _Life of Nicias_, says:--\"Everything accordingly\r\nwas prepared for embarkation, and the enemy paid no attention to these\r\nmovements, because they did not expect them. But in the night there\r\nhappened an eclipse of the Moon, at which Nicias and all the rest were\r\nstruck with a great panic, either through ignorance or superstition. As\r\nfor an eclipse of the Sun, which happens at the Conjunction, even the\r\ncommon people had some idea of its being caused by the interposition of\r\nthe Moon; but they could not easily form a conception, by the\r\ninterposition of what body the Moon, when at the full, should suddenly\r\nlose her light, and assume such a variety of colours. They looked upon\r\nit therefore as a strange and preternatural phenomenon, a sign by which\r\nthe gods announced some great calamity.\" And the calamity came to pass,\r\nbut only indirectly was it caused by the Moon!\r\n\r\nPlutarch and Pliny both mention that eleven days before the victory of\r\nAlexander over Darius, at Arbela in Assyria, there was an eclipse of the\r\nMoon. Plutarch's words (_Life of Alexander_) are, that \"there happened\r\nan eclipse of the Moon, about the beginning of the festival of the great\r\nmysteries at Athens. The eleventh night after that eclipse, the two\r\narmies being in view of each other, Darius kept his men under arms, and\r\ntook a general review of his troops by torch-light.\" This seems to have\r\nled to a great deal of disorderly tumult in the Assyrian camp, a fact\r\nwhich was noticed by Alexander. Several of his friends urged him to make\r\na night attack on the enemy's camp, but he preferred that his\r\nMacedonians should have a good night's rest, and it was then that he\r\nuttered the celebrated answer, \"I will not steal a victory.\" Plutarch\r\nenters upon some rather interesting moral reflections connected with\r\nthis answer, but which of course are foreign to the subject of this\r\nvolume. This eclipse happened on September 20, 331 B.C., and was total,\r\nthe middle of the eclipse being at about 8.15 p.m. It follows therefore,\r\nthat the celebrated battle of Arbela was fought on October 1, 331 B.C.\r\n\r\nIn 219 B.C. an eclipse of the Moon was seen in Mysia, according to\r\nPolybius.[123] The date of September 1 has been assigned for this\r\neclipse which is said to have so greatly alarmed some Gaulish Mercenary\r\ntroops in the service of Attalus, King of Pergamos, that he had to get\r\nrid of them as soon as he could--make terms with them to go home.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of the battle of Pydna when Perseus, King of Macedonia, was\r\nconquered by Paulus Æmilius, there happened an eclipse of the Moon.\r\nPlutarch in his _Life of Paulus Æmilius_, speaking of his army having\r\nsettled down in a camp, says:--\"When they had supped and were thinking of\r\nnothing but going to rest, on a sudden the Moon, which was then at full\r\nand very high, began to be darkened, and after changing into various\r\ncolours, was at last totally eclipsed. The Romans, according to their\r\ncustom, made a great noise by striking upon vessels of brass and held up\r\nlighted faggots and torches in the air in order to recall her light; but\r\nthe Macedonians did no such thing; horror and astonishment seized their\r\nwhole camp, and a whisper passed among the multitude that this\r\nappearance portended the fall of the king. As for Æmilius, he was not\r\nentirely unacquainted with this matter; he had heard of the ecliptic\r\ninequalities which bring the Moon at certain periods under the shadow of\r\nthe Earth and darken her till she has passed that quarter of obscurity\r\nand receives light from the Sun again. Nevertheless, as he was wont to\r\nascribe most events to the Deity, was a religious observer of sacrifices\r\nand of the art of divination, he offered up to the Moon 11 heifers as\r\nsoon as he saw her regain her former lustre. At break of day he also\r\nsacrificed oxen to Hercules to the number of 20 without any auspicious\r\nsign, but in the twenty-first the desired tokens appeared and he\r\nannounced victory to his troops, provided they stood upon the\r\ndefensive.\"\r\n\r\nThe astronomical knowledge ascribed in this account to Paulus Æmilius,\r\nconstitutes a very interesting feature in this record because the Romans\r\nthough they were good at most things, were by no means adepts at the\r\nscience of Astronomy. Livy[124] tells us that Sulpicius Gallus, one of\r\nthe Roman tribunes, foretold this eclipse, first to the Consul and then,\r\nwith his leave, to the army, whereby that terror which eclipses were\r\nwont to breed in ignorant minds was entirely taken off and the soldiers\r\nmore and more disposed to confide in officers of so great wisdom and of\r\nsuch general knowledge. This eclipse is often identified with that of\r\nJune 21, 168 B.C., but Johnson gives reasons why this cannot be the case\r\nand that the eclipse in question was that which happened on the night of\r\nJune 10-11, 167 B.C., and commenced about midnight, whereas the eclipse\r\nof 168 B.C. was nearly over when the Moon was above the horizon at Rome.\r\nStockwell, however, fixes on the eclipse of September 3, 172 B.C. as\r\nthat which was connected with the Battle of Pydna.\r\n\r\nJosephus[125] speaking of the barbarous acts of Herod, says:--\"And that\r\nvery night there was an eclipse of the Moon.\" There has been some\r\ncontroversy respecting the identification of this eclipse (the only one\r\nmentioned by Josephus) which also is associated with Herod's last\r\nillness, it not having been easy to reconcile some discordant\r\nchronological statements connected with the length of Herod's reign and\r\nthe date when he began to reign. On the whole, probably, we shall be\r\nsafe in saying that the reference is to the eclipse of March 13, 4 B.C.\r\nThis was a partial eclipse to the extent of less than half the Moon's\r\ndiameter, a defalcation of light sufficient, however, to attract public\r\nnotice even at 3 a.m., seeing that no doubt, even at that hour, the\r\nstreets of Jerusalem were in a state of turmoil owing to the burning\r\nalive by Herod of some seditious Rabbis.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated, however, that Hind assigns the account by Josephus\r\nto the eclipse which occurred on January 9, 1 B.C. On this occasion the\r\nMoon passed nearly centrally through the Earth's shadow soon after\r\nmidnight, emerging at 2.57 a.m. on the early morning of January 10,\r\nlocal Mean Time at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nTacitus[126] mentions an eclipse of the Moon as having happened soon\r\nafter the death of Augustus. This has been identified with the eclipse\r\nof September 27, A.D. 14. Tacitus says:--\"The Moon in the midst of a\r\nclear sky became suddenly eclipsed; the soldiers who were ignorant of\r\nthe cause took this for an omen referring to their present adventures:\r\nto their labours they compared the eclipse of the planet, and prophesied\r\n'that if to the distressed goddess should be restored her wonted\r\nbrightness and splendour, equally successful would be the issue of\r\ntheir struggle.' Hence they made a loud noise, by ringing upon brazen\r\nmetal, and by blowing trumpets and cornets; as she appeared brighter or\r\ndarker they exulted or lamented.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an eclipse of the Moon on the generally recorded date of the\r\nCrucifixion of our Lord, April 3, A.D. 33. Hind found that our satellite\r\nemerged from the Earth's dark shadow about a quarter of an hour before\r\nshe rose at Jerusalem (6h. 36m. p.m.), but the penumbra continued upon\r\nher disc for an hour afterwards.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 1, A.D. 47, a total eclipse of the Moon was seen at Rome, and on\r\nthe same night an island rose up in the Ægean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe total eclipse of Feb. 22, A.D. 72, noted by Pliny,[127] is the first\r\nin which it is recorded that Sun and Moon were both visible at the same\r\ntime, the eclipse occurring when the Sun was rising and the Moon\r\nsetting.\r\n\r\nTrithenius speaks of an eclipse of the Moon observed in the time of\r\nMerovæus. Johnson identifies it with the eclipse of Sept. 15, 452 A.D.\r\nIt was from Merovæus that the line of French kings known as Merovingians\r\nreceived their name.\r\n\r\nOn April 16, A.D. 683, according to Anastasius the Papal historian, the\r\nMoon for nearly the whole night exhibited a blood-red appearance, and\r\ndid not emerge from obscurity till cockcrowing.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 690 an eclipse of the Moon was observed in Wales. We are\r\ntold[128] that \"the Moon was turned to the colour of blood.\" This would\r\nseem to be the first eclipse of the Moon recorded in Britain.\r\n\r\nThe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ tells us that in A.D. 734 \"the Moon was as\r\nif it had been sprinkled with blood, and Archbishop Tatwine and Beda\r\ndied and Ecgberht was hallowed bishop.\" The intended inference\r\napparently is that the Moon had something to do with the deaths of the\r\ntwo ecclesiastics, but this theory will not hold water. Beda, it may be\r\nremarked, is the correct name of the man generally known to us as the\r\n\"Venerable Bede.\" It is evident that from the description of the Moon it\r\nexhibited on that occasion the well-known coppery hue which is a\r\nrecognised feature of many total eclipses of our satellite. This eclipse\r\noccurred on January 24, beginning at about 1 a.m.\r\n\r\nOn the night of January 23, A.D. 753, \"the Moon was covered with a\r\nhorrid black shield.\" This is the record of an eclipse. It occurred at\r\nabout midnight, and apparently we are entitled to infer that on this\r\noccasion the Moon disappeared altogether, instead of being discoverable\r\nduring the total phase by exhibiting a coppery hue.\r\n\r\nIn A.D. 755 [or 756 in orig.], on November 23, there happened an\r\nexceedingly interesting event which stands, I think, without a precedent\r\nin the annals of science--an eclipse of the Moon contemporaneous with an\r\noccultation of a planet by the Moon. This singular combination is thus\r\ndescribed in the annals of Roger de Hoveden[129]:--\"On the 8th day\r\nbefore the Calends of December the Moon on her 15th day being about her\r\nfull, appeared to be covered with the colour of blood, and then the\r\ndarkness decreasing she returned to her usual brightness; but, in a\r\nwondrous manner, a bright star followed the Moon, and passing across\r\nher, preceded her when shining, at the same distance which it had\r\nfollowed her before she was darkened.\" The details here given are not\r\nastronomically quite correct, but let that pass; the writer's intention\r\nis fairly clear. Calculation shows that the eclipse occurred on November\r\n23, and that the planet, which was Jupiter, was concealed in the evening\r\nby the Moon for about an hour from 7h. 30m. to 8h. 30m. p.m., the\r\nimmersion taking place about the end of the total phase. This is the\r\nfirst occultation of a star or planet by the Moon observed and recorded\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nUnder the year 795 the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ says:--\"In this year the\r\nMoon was eclipsed between cockcrowing and dawn on the 5th of the Calends\r\nof April; and Eardwalf succeeded to the kingdom of the Northumbrians on\r\nthe 2nd of the Ides of May.\" This signifies that the eclipse happened on\r\nMarch 28 between 3h. and 6h. in the morning, the method of dividing the\r\nhours of night into equal portions of three hours each being still in\r\nuse. There was no eclipse in 795 on the date in question but there was\r\none in 796, so we may suppose an error in the year. This assumed,\r\nJohnson found that the eclipse began at about 4h. a.m., was total for\r\nnearly an hour, and ended at about 7½h., so that the Moon set eclipsed.\r\nBut the above assumption is dispensed with by Lynn who substitutes one\r\nof his own.[130] For \"5th of the _Calends_\" he reads \"5th of the\r\n_Ides_,\" which means April 9; and on that day in 795 he says there was\r\nan eclipse of the Moon, but I have not found any other record of it.\r\n\r\nIn the year A.D. 800, according to the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, \"the\r\nMoon was eclipsed at the 2nd hour of the night (8h. p.m.) on the 17th\r\nday of the Calends of February.\" Johnson finds that there was an eclipse\r\nof the Moon on Jan. 15. The middle of the eclipse occurred at 8h. 34m.,\r\n9/10ths of the Moon's upper limb having been obscured.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of 806 the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ says:--\"This year was\r\nthe Moon eclipsed on the Kalends [1st] of September; and Eardwulf, King\r\nof the Northumbrians, was driven from his kingdom, and Eanberht, Bishop\r\nof Hexham, died.\" This eclipse was total, the totality lasting from\r\n9h. 37m. to 10h. 59m. p.m.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 15, 817, according to the _Annales Fuldenses_, an eclipse of the\r\nMoon was observed in the early evening at Paris, and on the same night a\r\nComet was seen. This Comet is described by another authority as a\r\n\"monstrous\" one and as being in Sagittarius on Feb. 5. The Chinese date\r\nit for Feb. 17, and place it near the stars [Greek: alpha] and [Greek:\r\ngamma] Tauri.\r\n\r\nIn 828 two lunar eclipses were seen in Europe, the first on July 1 very\r\nearly in the morning, and the second on the morning of Christmas Day.\r\nThe _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ thus speaks of the second eclipse:--\"In this\r\nyear the Moon was eclipsed on Mid-winter's Mass-night, and the same year\r\nKing Ecgbryht subdued the kingdom of the Mercians and all that was South\r\nof the Humber.\" The totality occurred after midnight. There is some\r\nconfusion in the year of this eclipse, the _Chronicle_ giving it as 827,\r\nwhilst calculation shows that it must have been 828. Lynn defines\r\n\"Mid-winter's Mass-night\" as Christmas _Eve_.\r\n\r\nUnder the date of 904 the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ says:--\"In this year\r\nthe Moon was eclipsed.\" There were two total eclipses of the Moon this\r\nyear, one on May 31, and the other on Nov. 25, and it does not appear\r\nwhich one is referred to in the _Chronicle_ cited. Another writer,\r\nCedrenus, speaks of a great eclipse of the Moon this year which he says\r\nforetold the death of a kinsman of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nOn October 6, 1009, there was a total eclipse of the Moon which\r\npresumably is referred to in the statement that \"this year the Moon was\r\nchanged into blood.\"\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 8, 1044, there was a large partial eclipse in the morning. Raoul\r\nGlaber[131] (a French chronicler who died about 1050) comments upon it\r\nthus:--\"In what manner it happened, whether a prodigy brought to pass by\r\nthe Deity or by the intervention of some heavenly body, remains known to\r\nthe author of knowledge. For the Moon herself became like dark blood,\r\nonly getting clear of it a little before the dawn.\" Truly those times\r\nwere the \"Dark Ages\" in which ignorance and folly were rampant, seeing\r\nthat more than 1000 years previously the Greeks knew all about the\r\ncauses of eclipses.\r\n\r\nUnder 1078 the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_ says:--\"In this year the Moon was\r\neclipsed 3 nights before Candlemas, and Ægelwig, the 'world-wide' Abbot\r\nof Evesham, died on St. Juliana's Mass-day [Feb. 16]; and in this year\r\nwas the dry summer, and wildfire came in many Shires and burned many\r\ntowns.\" Johnson found that a total eclipse of the Moon happened in the\r\nearly evening of Jan. 30.\r\n\r\nOn May 5, 1110, in the reign of Henry I., there occurred a total eclipse\r\nof the Moon during which, says the _Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_, \"the Moon\r\nappeared in the evening brightly shining and afterwards by little and\r\nlittle its light waned, so that as soon as it was night it was so\r\ncompletely quenched that neither light nor orb nor anything at all of it\r\nwas seen. And so it continued very near until day, and then appeared\r\nfull and brightly shining. It was on this same day a fortnight old. All\r\nthe night the air was very clear, and the stars over all the heaven were\r\nbrightly shining. And the tree-fruits on that night were sorely nipt.\"\r\nThe totality occurred before mid-night. It is evident that this was an\r\ninstance of a \"black\" eclipse when the Moon becomes quite invisible\r\ninstead of shining with the familiar coppery hue.\r\n\r\nIn 1117 there were two total eclipses, the first on June 16, and the\r\nsecond on December 10. The latter is thus referred to in the\r\n_Anglo-Saxon Chronicle_:--\"In the night of the 3rd of the Ides of\r\nDecember the Moon was far in [during a long time of] the night as if it\r\nwere all bloody, and afterwards eclipsed.\" The totality commenced at\r\n11.36 p.m.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded by Matthew Paris[132] in connection with the death of\r\nHenry I. that \"the Moon also was eclipsed the same year on the 29th of\r\nJuly\" [1135]. These words seem to indicate a total eclipse of the Moon.\r\nJohnson gives the date as Dec. 22, 1135. If this is correct the text of\r\nthe _Chronicle_ must be corrupt. The whole eclipse was not visible in\r\nEngland, the Moon setting before the middle of the eclipse. Stephen had\r\nbeen crowned king the same day, namely Dec. 22.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 1349, there was a total eclipse of the Moon visible at\r\nLondon to which some interest attaches. Archdeacon Churton[133] connects\r\nit with the following incident:--\"The worthy Abp. Bradwardine, who\r\nnourished in the reign of the Norman Edwards, and died A.D. 1349, tells\r\na story of a witch who was attempting to impose on the simple people of\r\nthe time. It was a fine summer's night, and the Moon was suddenly\r\neclipsed. 'Make me good amends,' said she, 'for old wrongs, or I will\r\nbid the Sun also to withdraw his light from you.' Bradwardine, who had\r\nstudied the Arabian astronomers, was more than a match for this simple\r\ntrick, without calling in the aid of the Saxon law. 'Tell me,' he said,\r\n'at what time you will do this, and we will believe you; or if you will\r\nnot tell me, I will tell you when the Sun or the Moon will next be\r\ndarkened, in what part of their orb the darkness will begin, how far it\r\nwill spread, and how long it will continue.'\"\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the Moon which happened when Columbus was at the Island of\r\nJamaica proved of great service to him when he was in difficulties owing\r\nto the want of food supplies which the inhabitants refused to afford.\r\nThe eclipse was a total one, and so far as the description goes the\r\neclipses of April 2, 1493, and March 1, 1504, both respond to the\r\nrecorded circumstances: both were total and both occurred soon after\r\nsunset. But, inasmuch as in the life of Columbus written by his son the\r\nincident is placed nearly at the end of the work, there can be no doubt\r\nthat it is the later of the above eclipses which was the one in\r\nquestion. The story is very graphically told by Sir A. Helps[134] in the\r\nwords following:--\r\n\r\n\"The Indians refused to minister to their wants any longer; and famine\r\nwas imminent. But just at this last extremity, the admiral, ever fertile\r\nin devices, bethought him of an expedient for re-establishing his\r\ninfluence over the Indians. His astronomical knowledge told him that on\r\na certain night an eclipse of the Moon would take place. One would think\r\nthat people living in the open air must be accustomed to see such\r\neclipses sufficiently often not to be particularly astonished at them.\r\nBut Columbus judged--and as the event proved, judged rightly--that by\r\npredicting the eclipse he would gain a reputation as a prophet, and\r\ncommand the respect and the obedience due to a person invested with\r\nsupernatural powers. He assembled the caciques of the neighbouring\r\ntribes. Then, by means of an interpreter, he reproached them with\r\nrefusing to continue to supply provisions to the Spaniards. 'The God who\r\nprotects me,' he said, 'will punish you. You know what has happened to\r\nthose of my followers who have rebelled against me; and the dangers\r\nwhich they encountered in their attempt to cross Haiti, while those who\r\nwent at my command made the passage without difficulty. Soon, too, shall\r\nthe divine vengeance fall on you; this very night shall the Moon change\r\nher colour and lose her light, in testimony of the evils which shall be\r\nsent upon you from the skies.'\r\n\r\n\"The night was fine: the moon shone down in full brilliancy. But at the\r\nappointed time the predicted phenomenon took place, and the wild howls\r\nof the savages proclaimed their abject terror. They came in a body to\r\nColumbus and implored his intercession. They promised to let him want\r\nfor nothing if only he would avert this judgment. As an earnest of their\r\nsincerity they collected hastily a quantity of food and offered it at\r\nhis feet. At first, diplomatically hesitating, Columbus presently\r\naffected to be softened by their entreaties. He consented to intercede\r\nfor them; and, retiring to his cabin, performed, as they supposed, some\r\nmystic rite which should deliver them from the threatened punishment.\r\nSoon the terrible shadow passed away from the face of the moon, and the\r\ngratitude of the savages was as deep as their previous terror. But being\r\nblended with much awe, it was not so evanescent as gratitude often is;\r\nand henceforth there was no failure in the regular supply of provisions\r\nto the castaways.\"\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe observed a lunar eclipse on July 7, 1590. He writes:--\"In the\r\nmorning about 3¾h. the Moon began to be eclipsed: in this eclipse it is\r\nnotable that both luminaries were at the same time above the horizon; a\r\nlike case which Pliny cites. For the centre of the Sun emerged when the\r\nMoon was 2° elevated above the Western horizon, and when her centre was\r\nsetting, the centre of the Sun was elevated nearly 2°.\"[135]\r\n\r\nOn August 16, 1598, there occurred a total eclipse of the Moon, observed\r\nby Kepler,[136] in which during totality a part of the Moon was visible\r\nand the rest invisible. He says, that while one-half of the disc was\r\nseen with great difficulty the other half was discernible by a deep red\r\nlight of such brilliancy that at first he was doubtful whether our\r\nsatellite was immersed in the Earth's shadow at all. This is an instance\r\nof the simultaneous operation of those causes (whatever they may be)\r\nwhich result in a totally-eclipsed Moon being sometimes wholly invisible\r\nand sometimes entirely visible as a copper-coloured disc.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the Moon which happened on the morning of July 6, 1610,\r\nmay be mentioned as having been the first to be viewed through a\r\ntelescope. The eclipse was only a large partial one. The following\r\nrecord of the fact is due to Tycho Brahe.[137] \"The beginning of the\r\neclipse of the Moon as observed through the Roman telescope, appeared\r\nlike a dark thread in contact with the shadow\"--a description which\r\ncannot be said to be unduly explicit.\r\n\r\nIn 1620, on June 15, there was a total eclipse of the Moon, when during\r\nthe total phase \"the Moon was seen with great difficulty. It shone,\r\nmoreover, like the thinnest nebula, far fainter than the Milky Way,\r\nwithout any copper tinge. About the middle of the second hour nothing at\r\nall could be seen of the Moon with the naked eye, and through the\r\ntelescope so doubtfully was anything seen that no one could tell whether\r\nthe Moon was not something else.\" It is expressly stated, however, that\r\nthe sky was quite clear. Kepler also observed this eclipse, and says\r\nthat the Moon quite disappeared, though stars of the 4th and 5th\r\nmagnitudes were plainly visible.[138] In this same year 1620, there was\r\non December 9 another total eclipse, when \"the Moon altogether\r\ndisappeared so that nothing could be seen of it, though the stars shone\r\nbrightly all around: she continued lost and invisible for a quarter of\r\nan hour more or less.\" This observation seems to have been made at\r\nIngolstadt.\r\n\r\nWendelinus mentions the eclipse of April 14, 1623, in connection with\r\nthe question of the visibility of the Moon when totally eclipsed. He\r\nsays, \"but sometimes it so far retains the light derived from the Sun\r\nthat you would doubt whether any part of it were eclipsed.\" This eclipse\r\nwas observed by Gassendi, and if the above record is correct, it is the\r\nmore remarkable seeing that the eclipse was not total, only 11/12ths of\r\nthe Moon's diameter being obscured.\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 1642, on the occasion of a total eclipse, Hevelius[139]\r\nnoted that the Moon wholly disappeared when immersed in the Earth's\r\nshadow. Crabtree is stated by Flamsteed[140] to have observed this\r\neclipse, but he does not plainly state that he lost sight of the Moon.\r\nCrabtree or his editor dates this eclipse for April 4; Ferguson for\r\nApril 15. There appears to be some muddle as between \"old style\" and\r\n\"new style.\" Ferguson professing to be N.S. is evidently wrong. Hevelius\r\ngives the double date, 15/25, which is evidently right.\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 1666, the Moon was seen in Tuscany to rise eclipsed, the Sun\r\nnot having yet set in the W.\r\n\r\nOn May 26, 1668, an eclipse of the Moon was in progress in the early\r\nmorning, when the Sun was seen to rise by members of the Academy of\r\nSciences who were observing the phenomenon at Montmartre near Paris.\r\n\r\nOn December 23, 1703, the Moon when totally immersed was seen at Avignon\r\nshowing a ruddy light of such brilliancy that we are told it had the\r\nappearance of a transparent body illuminated by a light placed behind.\r\nJohnson finds that the total phase took place in the early morning, and\r\nlasted from 5h. 36m. to 7h. 22m. a.m.\r\n\r\nThe lunar eclipse of May 18, 1761, as observed by Wargentin,[141] at\r\nStockholm, furnishes a remarkable instance of the invisibility of the\r\nMoon on certain occasions, when completely immersed in the earth's\r\nshadow. The total immersion of the Moon took place at 10h. 41m. p.m. The\r\npart of the margin of the lunar disc which had last entered the shadow\r\nwas fairly conspicuous for 5 or 6 minutes after the immersion, and to\r\nthe naked eye exhibited a lustre equal to that of a star of the 2nd\r\nmagnitude; but at 10h. 52m. this part, as well as the whole of the rest\r\nof the Moon's body, \"had disappeared so completely, that not the\r\nslightest trace of any portion of the lunar disc could be discerned\r\neither with the naked eye or with the telescope, although the sky was\r\nclear, and the stars in the vicinity of the Moon were distinctly visible\r\nin the telescope.\" After more than half an hour's search, Wargentin at\r\nlength discovered the whereabouts of the Moon by means of a faint light,\r\nwhich was visible at the Eastern edge of the disc. A few minutes\r\nafterwards, some persons of acute vision were able to discern, with the\r\nnaked eye, a trace of the Moon, looking like a patch of thin vapour, but\r\nmore than half the disc was still invisible.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of the Moon, on March 29, 1801, was observed by Humboldt, on\r\nboard ship, off the Island of Baru, not far from Cartagena de las\r\nIndias, in the Caribbean Sea.[142] He remarks that he was \"exceedingly\r\nstruck with the greater luminous intensity of the Moon's disc under a\r\ntropical sky than in my native North.\" Johnson makes Humboldt to refer\r\nto the greater clearness of the \"_reddened_ disc,\" but these words do\r\nnot appear either in the German or in the English version.\r\n\r\nA total eclipse of the Moon occurred on June 10, 1816. As observed by\r\nBeer and Mädler and others, the Moon completely disappeared. The summer\r\nof 1816, be it remembered, was very wet, and probably this had something\r\nto do with the Moon's invisibility at the eclipse in question.\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 1837, there happened a total eclipse of the Moon, of\r\nwhich Sir J. Herschel and Admiral W. H. Smyth have left us interesting\r\naccounts.[143] The changes of tint, both as regards times and places on\r\nthe Moon's disc, recorded by the latter, are very remarkable. And the\r\ntints themselves varied very much _inter se_: The Admiral speaks of\r\n\"copper,\" \"sea-green,\" \"neutral tint,\" and \"silvery,\" as hues visible in\r\none part of the Moon or another, and at one time or another.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 122: Dan. ix. 24.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 123: _Histories_, Book v., chap. lxxviii.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 124: _Hist.

It will\r\nbe evident to the reader that many more eclipses of interest have\r\nhappened, and will happen, than it has been possible to speak of in\r\nthese pages. Accordingly, as it is one of the main objects of this\r\nseries of volumes to create a thirst for knowledge, to be satisfied by\r\nthe study of other and bigger volumes, it will be desirable to furnish a\r\nlist of some of the various books and publications, in which eclipses\r\nwill be found catalogued or described in detail, so that readers\r\ndesirous of pursuing the matter further, may possess facilities for\r\ndoing so.\r\n\r\nBy far the most complete and comprehensive catalogue of solar eclipses\r\nis that prepared some years ago by an Austrian astronomer, the late\r\nTheodore Von Oppolzer of Vienna, and published under the title of _Canon\r\nder Finsternisse_, in the Memoirs of the Imperial Academy of\r\nSciences.[144] This work supplies approximate calculations of about 8000\r\neclipses of the Sun, for a period of more than 3000 years, from November\r\n10, 1207 B.C. (Julian Calendar), to November 17, 2161 A.D. (Gregorian\r\nCalendar). There are appended 160 charts, of all the principal\r\neclipses; but as the charts only exhibit the beginnings, middles, and\r\nends of the eclipses dealt with, they are frequently misleading, because\r\nthe intermediate lines of path are, in many cases, more or less\r\nconsiderably curved.\r\n\r\nAnother very important and comprehensive catalogue of eclipses, solar\r\nand lunar together, will be found in the well-known French work, _L'Art\r\nde vérifier les Dates_,[145] compiled by a member of the religious order\r\nof St. Maur. One volume of this famous work contains eclipses from the\r\nyear 1001 B.C. to the Christian Era, whilst another volume gives a\r\nsimilar catalogue from the year 1 A.D. to 2000 A.D. The other volumes\r\ndeal with chronological matters only. Although not strictly a work of\r\nextreme astronomical exactness, yet _L'Art de vérifier les Dates_ stands\r\nunrivalled as a record not only to subserve the purpose indicated by its\r\ntitle, but of the bare facts of the eclipses which have happened during\r\nthe period of 3000 years stated above.\r\n\r\nThere has not been much done in England in the way of publishing eclipse\r\nrecords or tables, past or future, but in the _British Almanac and\r\nCompanion_ for 1832 there is given a catalogue, which was useful in its\r\nday, of eclipses, then future from 1832 to 1900, omitting, however,\r\nsolar eclipses hardly visible to any inhabited portion of the Earth, and\r\nlunar eclipses where the part of the Moon's diameter obscured was less\r\nthan 1/12th.\r\n\r\nIn by-gone days several attempts were made to gather together in a\r\ntabular or paragraph form the details of eclipses which had happened,\r\nand some of these have been important sources of information for the\r\nguidance of us moderns. Foremost amongst these efforts must be named the\r\n_Almagestum Novum_ of J. B. Ricciolus.[146] This work contains a\r\ncatalogue of eclipses observed from 772 B.C. to A.D. 1647, and continued\r\nin tables to A.D. 1700. It is prefaced (pp. 286-8) by a long series of\r\nquotations from classical authors relating to eclipses, some few of\r\nwhich have already been mentioned in these pages.\r\n\r\nKepler paid much attention to eclipses, and left behind him a large mass\r\nof notes and original observations. These will be found chiefly in his\r\n_Astronomiæ Pars Optica_, c. vii. § 2, originally published at Frankfurt\r\nin 1604. The most convenient and accessible edition of this is to be\r\nfound in Frisch's reprint of all Kepler's works.[147]\r\n\r\nTycho Brahe also gathered together from various sources many\r\nobservations of eclipses, and combined them with a number of his own,\r\nthe whole being published in his _Historia Coelestis_.[148] Tycho Brahe\r\nwas a very interesting personage in spite of the fact that he went all\r\nastray on the subject of the system of the Universe, and he well\r\ndeserves, what has been given to him, a book[149] all to himself. It is\r\npeculiarly appropriate that I should give him a good word in this little\r\nvolume on eclipses, because it was the solar eclipse of Aug. 21, 1560,\r\nwhich first seriously led him to take up astronomical pursuits, he being\r\nthen 14 years of age, and struck with wonder that eclipses could be\r\npredicted.\r\n\r\nA vast amount of historical and other information respecting eclipses\r\nwill be found in a book, the latinised name of whose author is Sethus\r\nCalvisius. The title of the work is _Opus Chronologicum_.[150] The\r\nhistorical matter is very much mixed, but the eclipses can be got hold\r\nof through the Index, which is very full. P. Gassendi,[151] a well-known\r\nastronomer of the 17th century, left behind him observations of many\r\neclipses observed by himself between 1628 and 1655. In a book entitled\r\n_An Introduction to Universal Geography_,[152] one Nicolas Struyck in\r\nthe middle of the 18th century published a very full array of eclipse\r\nobservations collected with infinite pains from an endless variety of\r\nauthors ancient and modern.\r\n\r\nIn 1757 the well-known James Ferguson reprinted in his\r\n_Astronomy_,[153] but in a very condensed form, all Struyck's eclipses\r\nfrom 721 B.C. to A.D. 1485. Then he carried on his catalogue to 1800 by\r\nmeans of the materials furnished by Ricciolus and _L'Art de vérifier les\r\nDates_. Ferguson also invented a machine for illustrating mechanically\r\nthe circumstances of an eclipse. He called it the \"Eclipsareon.\" A full\r\ndescription is given in his book, mentioned above, but I do not know\r\nwhether any such instrument is still in existence, or, if so, where it\r\nis to be found.\r\n\r\nFerguson apologises[154] for the incompleteness of his eclipse\r\ninformation in the following words:--\"I have not cited one half of\r\nRicciolus's list of portentous eclipses, and for the same reason that he\r\ndeclines giving any more of them than what that list contains, namely,\r\nthat 'tis most disagreeable to dwell any longer on such nonsense, and as\r\nmuch as possible to avoid tiring the reader. The superstition of the\r\nancients may be seen by the few here copied. My author further says that\r\nthere were treatises written to show against what regions the malevolent\r\neffects of any particular eclipse was aimed, and the writers affirmed\r\nthat the effects of an eclipse of the Sun continued as many years as the\r\neclipse lasted hours, and that of the Moon as many months.\"\r\n\r\nThe most comprehensive (indeed almost the only) modern English book on\r\neclipses is the Rev. S. J. Johnson's,[155] of which frequent use has\r\nalready been made in these pages. It contains a vast amount of matter\r\nput together in a condensed form but the references to authorities are\r\nrather defective and deficient. Less comprehensive in one sense yet\r\nexceedingly valuable and interesting as a succinct summary of solar\r\neclipse knowledge up to the date of 1896 is Mrs. D. P. Todd's excellent\r\nlittle volume[156] which has been several times quoted on previous\r\npages. On various occasions in 1890 and following years Professor J. N.\r\nStockwell contributed to the American _Astronomical Journal_ a number of\r\npapers[157] discussing in a very interesting and exhaustive manner many\r\nof the eclipses recorded by the ancient classical authors. These papers\r\nshould be consulted by all who desire to realise the value of eclipse\r\nrecords in connection with mundane chronology.\r\n\r\nThe calculation of eclipses is a matter of some interest. It is beyond\r\nthe scope of the present work to explain even in outline the methods in\r\nuse, but with the aid of the books mentioned below[158] a reader\r\npossessed of the necessary time, mathematical knowledge, and patience,\r\nwill be able to pursue this matter as far as his inclination may lead\r\nhim. Johnson has found very useful the tables given in the eighth\r\nedition of the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ (Article, \"Astronomy\") but\r\nstrange to say these tables do not appear in ninth edition of that\r\nfamous work.\r\n\r\nLalande[159] has given numerous references to eclipses of the Sun during\r\nthe 16th, 17th and 18th centuries which may be useful to those who wish\r\nto work at the history of eclipses.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 144: _Denkschriften der Kaiserlichen Akademie der\r\n    Wissenschaften_, vol. lii.

The next day a pantomime was performed, exhibiting\r\nthe battle of the dragon and the Moon, and in which two or three hundred\r\npriests, bearing lanterns at the end of long sticks, dancing and\r\ncapering about, sometimes over the plain, and then over chairs and\r\ntables, bore no mean part.\r\n\r\nProfessor Russell, who is quoted elsewhere in this work with respect to\r\nChinese eclipses, makes the following remarks in regard to what happens\r\nnow in China when eclipses occur:--\"It will be interesting here to note\r\nthat, even at present, by Imperial command, special rites are performed\r\nduring solar and lunar eclipses. A president from each of the six\r\nboards, with two inferior officials, dressed in their official clothes,\r\nproceed to the T'ai-Ch'ang-Ssu. When the eclipse begins they change\r\ntheir robes for common garments made of plain black material, and\r\nkneeling down, burn incense. The president then beats one stroke on a\r\ngong, and the ceremony is taken up by all the attendant officials.\"\r\n\r\nA writer in _Chambers's Journal_[161] in an article entitled \"The Hindu\r\nview of the late Eclipse,\" gives an interesting and original account of\r\ndivers Hindu superstitions and ceremonies which came under his notice in\r\nconnection with the total eclipse of the Sun of Aug. 18, 1868. He\r\nremarks that \"European science has as yet produced but little effect\r\nupon the minds of the superstitious masses of India. Of the many\r\nmillions who witnessed the eclipse of the 18th of August last there were\r\ncomparatively few who did not verily believe that it was caused by the\r\ndragon Rahu in his endeavour to swallow up the Lord of Day.... The\r\npious Hindu, before the eclipse comes on, takes a torch, and begins to\r\nsearch his house and carefully removes all cooked food, and all water\r\nfor drinking purposes. Such food and water, by the eclipse, incur\r\n_Grahana seshah_, that is, uncleanness, and are rendered unfit for use.\r\nSome, with less scruples of conscience, declare that the food may be\r\npreserved by placing on it _dharba_ or _Kusa grass_,\" and much more to\r\nthe like effect is duly set out in the interesting article cited.\r\n\r\nDuring the total eclipse of the Sun of Aug. 7, 1869, the following\r\nincident is noted[162] to have occurred at a station on the Chilkaht\r\nriver, in Alaska, North America, frequented by Indians:--\r\n\r\n\"About the time the Sun was half obscured the chief Koh-Klux and all the\r\nIndians had disappeared from around the observing tent; they left off\r\nfishing on the river banks; all employments were discontinued; and every\r\nsoul disappeared; nor was a sound heard throughout the village of 53\r\nhouses. The natives had been warned of what would take place, but\r\ndoubted the prediction. When it did occur they looked upon me as the\r\ncause of the Sun's being 'very sick and going to bed.' They were\r\nthoroughly alarmed, and overwhelmed with an undefinable dread.\"\r\n\r\nA still more thrilling incident is thus recorded[163] of the eclipse of\r\nJuly 29, 1878, by a witness at Fort Sill, Indian Territory, U.S.:--\r\n\r\n\"On Monday last we were permitted to see the eclipse of the Sun in a\r\nbeautiful bright sky. Not a cloud was visible. We had made ample\r\npreparation, laying in a stock of smoked glass several days in advance.\r\nIt was the grandest sight I ever beheld, but it frightened the Indians\r\nbadly. Some of them threw themselves upon their knees and invoked the\r\nDivine blessing; others flung themselves flat on the ground, face\r\ndownward; others cried and yelled in frantic excitement and terror.\r\nFinally one old fellow stepped from the door of his lodge, pistol in\r\nhand, and fixing his eyes on the darkened Sun, mumbled a few\r\nunintelligible words and raising his arm took direct aim at the\r\nluminary, fired off his pistol, and after throwing his arms about his\r\nhead in a series of extraordinary gesticulations retreated to his own\r\nquarters. As it happened, that very instant was the conclusion of\r\ntotality. The Indians beheld the glorious orb of day once more peep\r\nforth, and it was unanimously voted that the timely discharge of that\r\npistol was the only thing that drove away the shadow and saved them from\r\nthe public inconvenience that would have certainly resulted from the\r\nentire extinction of the Sun.\"\r\n\r\nA certain Mr. F. Kerigan, in a book published in 1844, made the\r\nfollowing remarks on ancient Jewish ideas respecting eclipses:--\r\n\r\n\"The Israelites, like their benighted neighbours, esteemed an eclipse of\r\neither luminary as a supernatural and inauspicious omen, which filled\r\nthem with the most gloomy and fearful apprehensions: as may fairly be\r\ndeduced from the 8th chapter of Ezekiel, v. 15: 'Then he brought me to\r\nthe door of the Lord's House, which was towards the N.; and, behold\r\nthere sat women weeping for Tammuz.' Now Tammuz is the name under which\r\nAdonis was known in Palestine: he was the favourite of Venus, or\r\nAstarte, the principal goddess of the Philistines and Phoenicians. Being\r\nkilled by a wild boar, the prevailing superstition of the age induced\r\nthe uninformed multitude to believe that when the Moon was eclipsed, it\r\nwas in complement to their beloved goddess Venus or Astarte, who,\r\nconcealed behind the full Moon, sat weeping under a dark veil for the\r\nloss of her beloved Tammuz or Adonis.\"[164]\r\n\r\nThe African travellers, R. and J. Lander, have given[165] a graphic\r\naccount of what took place on the occasion of the eclipse of the Moon of\r\nSept. 2, 1830, as witnessed by themselves:--\"The earlier part of the\r\nevening had been mild, serene, and remarkably pleasant. The Moon had\r\narisen with uncommon lustre, and being at the full, her appearance was\r\nextremely delightful. It was the conclusion of the holidays, and many of\r\nthe people were enjoying the delicious coolness of a serene night, and\r\nresting from the laborious exertions of the day; but when the Moon\r\nbecame gradually obscured, fear overcame every one. As the eclipse\r\nincreased they became more terrified. All ran in great distress to\r\ninform their sovereign of the circumstance, for there was not a single\r\ncloud to cause so deep a shadow, and they could not comprehend the\r\nnature or meaning of an eclipse.... Groups of men were blowing on\r\ntrumpets, which produced a harsh and discordant sound; some were\r\nemployed in beating old drums, others again were blowing on bullocks'\r\nhorns.... The diminished light, when the eclipse was complete, was just\r\nsufficient for us to distinguish the various groups of people, and\r\ncontributed in no small degree to render the scene more imposing. If a\r\nEuropean, a stranger to Africa, had been placed on a sudden in the midst\r\nof the terror-struck people, he would have imagined himself to be among\r\na legion of demons, holding a revel over a fallen spirit.\"\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 159: _Bibliographie Astronomique._ Paris, 1803.

In _Macbeth_ we find:--\r\n\r\n    \"And slips of yew\r\n    Shivered in the Moon's eclipse\"\r\n            --Act iv. sc. 1.\r\n\r\nthe precise meaning of which is not very obvious. \"Shivered\" of course\r\nmeans divided into pieces, but the idea intended is obscure.\r\n\r\nThe next quotation is more comprehensive and reflects more plainly the\r\ncurrent of thought prevalent in Shakespeare's day, albeit here again the\r\nword \"eclipse\" will be found to stand without much definite connection\r\nwith what goes before. However the reader shall judge for himself:--\r\n\r\n    \"As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\r\n    Disasters in the Sun; and the moist star,\r\n    Upon whose influence Neptune's Empire stands,\r\n    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.\"\r\n            --_Hamlet_, act i. sc. 1.\r\n\r\nIn _King Lear_ we seem to come upon something very definitely\r\nhistorical, but I am not able to say what it is. The Earl of Gloster\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    \"These late eclipses in the Sun and Moon portend no good to us.\"\r\n\r\nWith this, Edmund, Gloster's son, apparently agrees, for he exclaims:--\r\n\r\n    \"These eclipses do portend these divisions.\"\r\n            --Act i. sc. 2.\r\n\r\nIn _Othello_, the Moor of Venice himself, in a moment of excitement,\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n    \"O, insupportable! O, heavy hour!\r\n    Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse\r\n    Of Sun and Moon, and that the affrighted globe\r\n    Should yawn at alteration.\"\r\n            --Act v. sc. 2.\r\n\r\nIn _Anthony and Cleopatra_ we find Anthony expressing what our\r\nforefathers so often thought in connection with astronomical matters:--\r\n\r\n    \"Alack, our terrine Moon is now eclipsed;\r\n    And it portends alone\r\n    The fall of Anthony!\"\r\n            --Act iii. sc. 11.\r\n\r\nMilton has an allusion to an eclipse of the Sun which possesses a\r\ntwo-fold interest--intrinsic and extrinsic. The former feature will be\r\nself-evident when the passage is read. The poet, in describing[166] the\r\nfaded splendour of the fallen archangel, compares him to the Sun seen\r\nunder circumstances which have temporarily deprived it of its normal\r\nbrilliancy and glory:--\r\n\r\n            \"As when the Sun new-risen\r\n    Looks through the horizontal misty air\r\n    Shorn of his beams, or, from behind the Moon\r\n    In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds\r\n    On half the nations, and with fear of change\r\n    Perplexes Monarchs.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been well said by Dr. Orchard[167] that \"this passage affords us\r\nan example of the sublimity of Milton's imagination and of his skill in\r\nadapting the grandest phenomena of nature to the illustration of his\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I alluded to in saying that extrinsic interest attached to this\r\nquotation, is the fact that these lines might have caused the\r\nsuppression of the poem as a whole. Mrs. Todd puts the matter\r\nthus:--\"_Paradise Lost_ was begun probably in 1658, although not finished\r\nuntil 1663, nor its thorough revision completed until 1665. The\r\ncensorship still existed, and Tomkyns (one of the chaplains through whom\r\nthe Archbishop gave or refused license), although a broader-minded man\r\nthan many of his day, found this passage especially objectionable. The\r\npoem was allowed to see the light only through the interposition of a\r\nfriend of Milton. Upon such slender chances may hang the life of an\r\nincomparable work of art! But it is easy to see that in the turbulent\r\ndays when Charles the Second had returned to power, after the death of\r\nCromwell, these lines should have been deemed dangerously suggestive, in\r\nimputing to monarchs 'perplexity' and 'fear of change.'\"\r\n\r\nOther allusions to eclipses by Milton will be found as follows:--\r\n\r\n            Through the air she comes,\r\n    \"Lur'd with the smell of infant blood, to dance\r\n    With Lapland witches, while the labouring Moon\r\n    Eclipses at their charms.\"\r\n            --_Paradise Lost_, Bk. ii. lines 663-6.\r\n\r\n    \"So saying, he dismiss'd them; they with speed\r\n    Their course through thickest constellation held,\r\n    Spreading their bane; the blasted stars look'd wan,\r\n    And planets, planet-struck, real eclipse,\r\n    Then suffer'd.\"\r\n            --_Paradise Lost_, Bk. x. lines 410-14.\r\n\r\n    \"O dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of Noon,\r\n    Irrecoverably dark, total eclipse,\r\n    Without all hope of day!\"\r\n            --_Samson Agonistes_, Lines 80-2.\r\n\r\n    \"It was that fatal and perfidious bark,\r\n    Built in th' eclipse, and rigg'd with curses dark,\r\n    That sunk so low that sacred heart of thine.\"\r\n            --_Lycidas_, Lines 100-2.\r\n\r\nPope, in the following lines, may be presumed to mean that the covering\r\nup of the Sun by the Moon, during a total eclipse, results in the Moon\r\nbecoming visible, at the cost of the Sun's disappearance:--\r\n\r\n    \"For Envy'd wit, like Sol eclips'd, makes known\r\n    Th' opposing body's grossness, not its own.\"\r\n            --_Essay on Criticism_, Lines 469-70.\r\n\r\nI have not attempted to pursue this matter through the pages of our\r\nmodern poets, but it is not unlikely that Scott and Tennyson\r\n(especially) would have something on the subject of eclipses.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 166: _Paradise Lost_, Book i., lines 594-9.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 167: _The Astronomy of Milton_, p. 259.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n           BRIEF HINTS TO OBSERVERS OF ECLIPSES OF THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few words (they must be few for lack of space) may usefully be added,\r\nby way of advice, to persons proposing to choose a suitable locality at\r\nwhich to station themselves for viewing a total eclipse of the Sun. To\r\nbegin with, of course they ought to get as close as possible to the\r\ncentral line, say within 10 or 20 miles at the most; this matter\r\nsettled, the next important point is to find out where the duration of\r\nthe totality will be longest, coupled with the Sun at its maximum\r\nelevation above the horizon (to escape the influence of mists and fogs).\r\nNo advice, properly so-called, can be given on these points, because\r\nthey depend on the special circumstances of every eclipse, and must be\r\nascertained _ad hoc_ from the _Nautical Almanac_.\r\n\r\nIn anticipation of a forthcoming eclipse, it is very important to know\r\nbeforehand the probabilities of weather. If the _locus in quo_ of an\r\nexpected eclipse is in a civilised country, there will generally not be\r\nmuch difficulty in obtaining a certain amount of information as to this\r\n6 or 12 months in advance. But inasmuch as total eclipses of the Sun,\r\nand often the best of them, are visible only in uncivilised countries or\r\nover trackless wastes, the problem becomes a complicated and anxious\r\none. In such cases it is exceedingly desirable, where competent\r\nobservers (including money) are available, that preliminary notes of\r\nweather should be made for a year or even two years in advance. There is\r\nin one sense no difficulty as to this, for all the mathematical local\r\nelements of every eclipse are always made public three or four years in\r\nadvance through the pages of books like the _Nautical Almanac_, the\r\n_Connaissance des Temps_, the _Berliner Jahrbuch_, &c. One difficulty\r\nalways confronts every eclipse expedition. If an out-of-the-way part of\r\nthe world has to be visited, accessible by sea, transport from England,\r\nsay, to the foreign shore is not usually a matter of difficulty, because\r\nGovernment ships are often placed at the disposal of astronomers. But\r\nthe gravest difficulties often have to be faced after the arrival at the\r\nforeign shore, and for this reason. Every sea coast is, as a general\r\nrule applicable to the whole world, bad for astronomical observations.\r\nThe problem then which has to be solved is, how best to get away from\r\nthe coast inland to a high hill, and to find the means of transporting\r\nthither heavy packing-cases of instruments, personal luggage, creature\r\ncomforts, and, if needs be, tents and the other accessories of camp\r\nlife. Let not the reader of either sex take fright at the idea of\r\nsleeping under a tent. I speak with considerable experience when I say\r\nthat, given fine or fairly fine weather, nothing is more enjoyable in a\r\ntemperate climate. Under the term \"creature comforts\" I mean such things\r\nas tinned soups and preserved provisions which nowadays can so easily be\r\npurchased everywhere in England, and of such good quality. I would\r\nrecommend these being taken even when the eclipse traveller expects to\r\nbe lodged in the dwelling-places of civilised nations. Of course, if in\r\norder to see his eclipse he has to go into the wilds of America, Asia,\r\nor Africa, he must start fully equipped with all those personal\r\n_impedimenta_ which will be found scheduled in the books mentioned in\r\nthe footnote.[168]\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 168: _The Tourists' Pocket-Book_, 1s.

A little thought given to this definition\r\nwill make it clear that a transit is essentially the same in principle\r\nas an eclipse of the Sun by the Moon--one body comes in front of another,\r\nand the former conceals in succession parts of the latter.\r\n\r\nPractically the word \"transit\" in this connection is more especially\r\napplied to passages of the inferior planets, Mercury and Venus, across\r\nthe Sun, or of the satellites of Jupiter across the disc of Jupiter,\r\nwhilst the word \"occultation\" more particularly calls to mind the\r\nconcealment of a star (apparently a little body) by the Moon (apparently\r\na big body) or of a satellite of Jupiter (a little body) by Jupiter (a\r\nbig body), the star and the satellite in each respective case passing\r\nbehind the occulting body and being concealed for a shorter or longer\r\ntime. Commonly the occulted body will remain hidden for an hour or two,\r\nmore or less. In the case of Jupiter the satellites of that planet may\r\nalso, on occasions, be seen to undergo eclipse in the shadow cast by\r\nJupiter itself. An eclipse of a Jovian satellite is therefore on all\r\nfours in principle the same as an eclipse of the Moon, caused, as we\r\nknow, by the Moon passing for a short time into the dark shadow cast by\r\nthe Earth. The conditions just laid down in respect of Jupiter and its\r\nsatellites also find a counterpart in the case of the satellites of\r\nSaturn, but whilst these phenomena are incessantly occurring and visible\r\nin the case of Jupiter, they are exceedingly rare in the case of Saturn\r\nowing to its greater distance and the difficulty of seeing most of its\r\nsatellites because of their small apparent size.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the circumstance that transits of Mercury and Venus\r\nonly happen at intervals of many years, it is not worth while for the\r\npurposes of this work to devote any great amount of space to them. In\r\npoint of fact, whilst the next three transits of Mercury are as remote\r\nas 1907, 1914 and 1924, there will be no transit of Venus at all during\r\nthe 20th century; not another indeed until A.D. 2004.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of an amateur astronomer the various phenomena which\r\nattend the movements of the satellites of Jupiter, constitute an endless\r\nvariety of interesting scenes, which are the more deserving of attention\r\nin that they can be followed with the aid of a telescope of very\r\nmoderate size and capabilities.[169]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15-16.--OCCULTATION OF JUPITER, AUG. 7, 1889\r\n(_Immersion_)]\r\n\r\nOccultations of planets and stars by the Moon may also be recommended to\r\nthe notice of the owners of small telescopes as events which are\r\nconstantly happening and which may be readily observed. The Moon being\r\nrapidly in motion it will happen in point of fact that stars are\r\nocculted by it, one may say every day, but of course the Moon's light\r\nentirely blots out the smaller stars and only those as large as, say,\r\nabout the 5th magnitude are as a rule worth trying to see in this\r\nconnection. A table of the occultations of such stars, copied from the\r\n_Nautical Almanac_, will be found in such almanacs as _Whitaker's_ and\r\nthe _British_. If such a table is consulted it will be found that never\r\ndoes a lunation pass without a few stars being noted as undergoing\r\noccultation, and now and then a planet. An occultation of a planet is\r\nobviously still more interesting than that of a star.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17-18.--OCCULTATION OF JUPITER, AUG. 7, 1889\r\n(_Emersion_).]\r\n\r\nFrom the epoch of New to Full Moon the Moon moves with its dark edge\r\nforemost from the epoch of Full to New with its illuminated edge\r\nforemost. During therefore the first half of a lunation the objects\r\nocculted disappear at the dark edge and reappear at the illuminated\r\nedge, during the second half of a lunation things are _vice versâ_. The\r\nmost interesting time for watching occultations is with a young Moon no\r\nmore than, say, from 2 to 6 days old, because under such circumstances\r\nthe star occulted is suddenly extinguished at a point in the sky where\r\nthere seems nothing to interfere with it.\r\n\r\n    FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 169: For details as to these matters, see my _Handbook of\r\n    Astronomy_, 4th ed., vol. i. pp. 186-196.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n             THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN OF MAY 28, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Appendix deals solely with geographical and transport matters as to\r\nwhich accurate information is not easily obtainable, the European _locus\r\nin quo_ of the Eclipse being in the benighted and somewhat untravelled\r\ncountries of Portugal and Spain.\r\n\r\nThe intending Eclipse excursionist must first make his choice between\r\n(practically) a journey of all sea or of all land. The several sea\r\nroutes are one and all very much cheaper than any possible land journey,\r\nand almost as quick in point of time, with the minimum amount of\r\npersonal knocking about. But (some persons will say) sea is sea, and so\r\nit is. On the other hand the land journey is exceedingly expensive; and\r\nbeyond France the trains are very incommodious as regards hours, speed,\r\nand connections. Moreover, there being more frontiers than one to cross,\r\nthere are extra opportunities for Custom-house squabbles, and Spain\r\nespecially is famous for this sort of thing.\r\n\r\nAs the Eclipse shadow will strike Europe in Portugal and quit Europe in\r\nSpain the intending traveller must first decide for himself whether he\r\nwill prefer to go to Portugal or Spain. This settled, he will have the\r\nchoice of several sea routes and, in particular, of two land routes. But\r\nbefore considering these further it will be well to state what are the\r\nchief of the various places which are available as observing stations\r\nfor mixed travelling parties of ladies and gentlemen who have no desire\r\nto rough it in out-of-the-way parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe line of central eclipse passes across the Peninsula diagonally from\r\nN.W. to S.E. It enters Portugal on the coast not far from Oporto in\r\nlatitude 40° 50' N., longitude 8° 38' W. of Greenwich. It quits Spain on\r\nthe coast at Cape Santa Pola, not far from Alicante, in latitude 38° 13'\r\nN., longitude 0° 30' W. At Ovar in Portugal (pop. 11,000), 23m. S. of\r\nOporto the duration of the total phase will be 1m. 33½s., and the Sun's\r\naltitude at totality will be 42°. At Talavera de la Reina in Spain (pop.\r\n9700) the duration will be 1m. 27½s., and the altitude 39°; whilst at\r\nAlicante (pop. 40,000) the duration will be still less, 1m. 19s., and\r\nthe Sun's altitude only 34°. The three towns of Ovar, Talavera and\r\nAlicante are selected _Nautical Almanac_ Eclipse stations, for which\r\nspecial calculations have been made.\r\n\r\nHotel accommodation may be had at all the foregoing places, Oporto,\r\nOvar, Talavera and Alicante, as will be stated later on, but the Hotels\r\nat Ovar and Talavera are not of much account.\r\n\r\nOther towns more or less handy for the central line are few in number,\r\nand as a rule deficient in lodging accommodation conforming to the\r\nEnglish standard. Amongst such possible alternative places the\r\nfollowing may be named (in order of position from N.W. to S.E.) as\r\naccessible by railway:--\r\n\r\nVIZEU (pop. 7000; hotels, _Mabilia_, _Cadite_), on a branch of the Beira\r\nAlta Railway 31m. from Santa Comba Dao Junction, which itself is 88m.\r\nfrom Oporto.\r\n\r\nMANGUALDE (pop. 3000), on the Beira Alta Railway, 115m. from Oporto, and\r\n49m. from Pampilhosa Junction.\r\n\r\nPLASENCIA (pop. 6000; hotel, _F. de Eusebio Sierra_), 6m. N. of the\r\nstation of that name on the Lisbon and Madrid Railway.\r\n\r\nNAVALMORAL (pop. 3300, buffet), a station on the Lisbon and Madrid\r\nRailway about 8m. W. of the central line of eclipse.\r\n\r\nURDA, a small station on the Madrid and Ciudad Real Railway, crossed by\r\nthe central line. The nearest accommodation would seem to be at Ciudad\r\nReal (pop. 14,000; hotel, _Baltasar Garcia_), 33m. to the S.\r\n\r\nALCAZAR DE SAN JUAN Junction (pop. 8400; good buffet; hotel, _Casa\r\nBriseño_). Alcazar is 92m. S. of Madrid; the central line crosses the\r\nrailway about 15m. to the S. of the town.\r\n\r\nTOBARRA (pop. 7500), a station on the Chinchilla and Cartagena Railway,\r\n212m. S. of Madrid, and 115m. N. of Cartagena, lies about 6m. S. of the\r\ncentral line.\r\n\r\nNOVELDA (pop. 8000), a station on the Alicante and Madrid Railway, in a\r\nbeautiful valley about 20m. N. of Alicante.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above places it must not be forgotten that both\r\nOporto at one end of the zone of totality and Alicante at the other are\r\nwithin the track of the shadow, but the question of the meteorological\r\nconditions of the atmosphere at these places (on the seaboard as they\r\nvirtually are) has to be considered.\r\n\r\nA traveller from England to Portugal or Spain by sea has the following\r\nchoice of routes:--\r\n\r\n1. _Southampton to Oporto_, fortnightly, on Fridays, by the steamers of\r\nthe \"Royal Mail Steam Packet Co.\" Fare, first-class return, about £11.\r\nTime, about 54h. The return tickets are conveniently grouped in various\r\nways, _e.g._ Southampton to Oporto, and back from Vigo or Lisbon; or\r\nSouthampton to Lisbon and back, or back from Vigo (_but not back from\r\nOporto_). Where the booking is to Vigo, or Lisbon, of course the local\r\nrailway fares have to be paid in addition. Lisbon is 209m. S. of Oporto;\r\nVigo, 110m. N. of Oporto. One objection to making any use of Vigo is the\r\nextra Custom-house formalities which have to be gone through on the\r\nfrontier, and Spanish Custom-house officials are specially\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\n2. _Liverpool_ to _Corunna_, _Carril_, _Vigo_ and _Oporto_, fortnightly,\r\non Thursdays, by the steamers of the \"Pacific Steam Navigation Co.\"\r\nFares, to the Spanish ports, first-class single, £6, 10s., return, £9,\r\n15s.; second-class single, £4. To the Portuguese ports, first-class\r\nsingle, £8, return, £12; second-class single, £5. Time, about 4 to 5\r\ndays. This does not mean that the steamers are very slow, but they call\r\nalso at La Rochelle, in France.\r\n\r\n3. _London_ (Irongate Wharf) to _Oporto_, at intervals of 3 weeks, on\r\nThursdays, by the steamers of the \"General Steam Navigation Co.\" Fares,\r\nfirst-class single, £4 (no return tickets issued; no second-class). The\r\nsteamers of this line are inferior to all the others.\r\n\r\n4. _London_ (Tilbury) to _Gibraltar_, weekly, on Thursdays, by the\r\n\"P. & O.\" steamers. Fares, first-class single, £10, return, £16. Time, 4\r\nto 5 days.\r\n\r\n5. _London_ (Tilbury) and _Plymouth_ to _Gibraltar_, fortnightly, on\r\nFridays, by the steamers of the \"Orient Co.\" Fares and time the same as\r\nthe \"P. & O.\"\r\n\r\nTravellers journeying to Oporto from England will probably not attempt\r\nto do any more local sight-seeing than what can be readily accomplished\r\nby simple railway trips in Portugal to or from Lisbon; but travellers\r\nlanding at Gibraltar will have it within their power to visit some of\r\nthe important towns of Southern Spain, such as Granada, Seville,\r\nCordova, Toledo, Cadiz, Malaga, &c.\r\n\r\nAn Eclipse excursionist who finds himself at Gibraltar, and who wishes\r\nto avoid as much as possible land travelling in Spain by going on to\r\nAlicante and stationing himself in that neighbourhood, must take\r\nshipping locally at Gibraltar. There are Spanish steamer services from\r\nGibraltar, and Malaga, to Alicante.\r\n\r\nAn overland traveller to Spain (it is presumed that none such will go as\r\nfar as Portugal) has the choice of two routes to eclipse stations in\r\nSpain, both starting from Paris:--(1) _viâ_ Bordeaux, Hendaye, Vittoria,\r\nBurgos and Medina del Campo, to Madrid, and thence either W. to Talavera\r\n(84m. from Madrid), or S. towards Alcazar de San Juan (92m. from\r\nMadrid); (2) _viâ_ Lyons, Perpignan, Barcelona and Valencia to Alicante.\r\nThe character of the train service on the second of these routes is\r\nalmost prohibitive, so that it is almost a question of _viâ_ Madrid or\r\nnot at all.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing paragraphs will furnish the reader with an outline of the\r\nwhole problem of how to reach from England a suitable eclipse station in\r\nthe Peninsula. This outline will pave the way for further details as to\r\nland journeys, which will be exhibited somewhat in the order of relative\r\ncomplexity and expense, beginning with the simplest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VIGO TO OPORTO.\r\n\r\nChief stations and distances from Vigo:--Redondela (8m.), Guillarey\r\nJunct. (24m.), Tuy (26m.), Vianna (57m.), Famalicao Junct. (88m.),\r\nOporto (108m.).\r\n\r\nVIGO (pop. 17,000; hotel, _Continental_) is an important commercial\r\ncentre with fine scenery all round. REDONDELA is one of the prettiest\r\ntowns in Spain, especially as viewed from the railway viaducts. At\r\nGUILLAREY carriages may have to be changed for TUY, the last station in\r\nSpain and a Custom-house. There is a fine cathedral at Tuy. The boundary\r\nis formed by the river Minho, spanned by a magnificent bridge 400 yards\r\nlong, railway above and carriage road underneath. Crossing it the train\r\nenters the Portuguese town of VALENÇA, where there is a strong fortress\r\nand a custom-house. VIANNA (pop. 7000; hotel, _Central_). The river Lima\r\nis here spanned by a double bridge (rail and road) 700 ft. long. From\r\nFAMALICAO there is a loop line to Oporto running round the coast and\r\n15m. longer than the main line. ERMEZINDE is the junction with the\r\nSpanish line to Barca d'Alva, Salamanca and France.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      OPORTO TO OVAR AND LISBON.\r\n\r\nFrom Oporto to Lisbon by the direct line it is 211m. Fares--first,\r\nsingle, £1, 11s.; second, single, £1, 3s. But forwards from Pampilhosa\r\n(66m.) there is a loop line to Lisbon, running along the coast, and 25m.\r\nlonger than the direct line. If it is proposed to visit some of the\r\nsights which will be mentioned presently, the coast line must be taken.\r\n\r\nChief stations between Oporto and Lisbon by the coast line:--Ovar (23m.),\r\nPampilhosa Junct. (66m.), Figueira da Foz (92m.), Leiria (132m.), Torres\r\nVedras (192m.), Lisbon, Rocio station, (236m.).\r\n\r\nOPORTO (pop. 120,000; hotels, _Grande Hotel do Porto_, _Hotel de Paris_)\r\nis a busy commercial city with much English colouring; _e.g._ church,\r\nhospital, doctor, club, and full modern facilities for locomotion by\r\ntramways, cabs and excursion carriages. The chief sights are:--(1)\r\nCathedral, (2) Bishop's Palace, (3) Church of St. Francisco, (4) Palacio\r\nda Bolsa, (5) Museu Portuense, (6) Museu Industrial, (7) Crystal Palace\r\nand Gardens, (8) Bridge of Don Luiz I., and (9) Convent immortalised by\r\nWellington in 1809 when he made his celebrated \"Passage of the Douro.\"\r\nThe port for Oporto where the steamers from England load and discharge\r\nis Leixões, about 4m. to the W., with a service of trains and trams into\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nOVAR.--This town being the nearest eclipse centre to England may be\r\nexpected to draw many travellers in 1900. Being only 22m. or 1½ hours\r\nfrom Oporto, a day trip may be made thither from Oporto, and this will\r\nsuit the convenience of those who prefer for lodgings a large city to a\r\nsmall provincial town. A train from Oporto at 7 a.m. returning at 7.45\r\np.m. will suffice for the requirements of all who will go armed only\r\nwith small instruments.\r\n\r\nPAMPILHOSA JUNCTION (Good Hotel).--Within 10m. to the N.-E. of this\r\nstation is the first of the special sights which can be seen in\r\nconnection with the Oporto-Lisbon railway. Take the train from\r\nPampilhosa to Luzo (6m.), omnibus thence (½ hour) to Busaco (Good\r\nHotel), and see the battlefield, the site of one of Wellington's least\r\nsuccessful victories. The panoramic views in all directions are superb.\r\nThe famous convent is now a Government School of Forestry. After seeing\r\nBusaco progress may be made to FIGUEIRA DA FOZ (38m. from Luzo--Good\r\nHotel), where the tourist may pass the night, unless he prefers to stay\r\nat Pampilhosa. Figueira is a seaside bathing-place of repute on a branch\r\nline.\r\n\r\nLEIRIA (pop. 3000, _Novo Hotel_).--Stay here two nights in order to have\r\nthe whole of the intervening day available for a circular tour by road\r\nto the Dominican Monastery at Batalha (7m.), and to the Cistercian\r\nMonastery at Alcobaça (13m. from Batalha, and also 13m. from Leiria).\r\nThe Batalha Monastery (built 1388-1515) is by common consent the finest\r\npiece of architecture in Portugal. The Alcobaça Monastery, the largest\r\nin the world, is of earlier date (1148-1222). The ch., 360 ft. long, is\r\nthe most interesting example of early Christian art in Portugal, whilst\r\nthe cloisters are reputed to be amongst the finest in Europe.\r\nRefreshments must be taken by the traveller, for none can be procured\r\nduring the drive. Vallado is really the nearest station to Alcobaça\r\n(3m.), but there is no sleeping accommodation there.\r\n\r\nLISBON (pop. 250,000; hotels--_Braganza_, _Avenida_, and some adjoining\r\nthe railway station) owing to its great length from E. to W., and narrow\r\nbreadth from N. to S., is a less easy city to find one's way in than\r\nmany other cities. This difficulty is aggravated by the want of leading\r\nthoroughfares and an efficient system of street naming and numbering.\r\nThe sights are the usual ones of every large Continental city, such as\r\nchurches, museums, and picture galleries; _e.g._ the Church of San\r\nRoque, the Church of San Vincente with its remarkable Royal Mortuary\r\nChapel, the church and convent at Belem, and the gardens of the Escola\r\nPolytechnica. But a day should certainly be set apart for a trip to\r\nCintra (17m. by rail, trains about every hour). The town (pop. 5000,\r\nhotel--_Lawrence's_) is 1800 ft. above the sea. See the Royal or Moorish\r\nPalace in the town, the beautiful Pena Palace and grounds, and the\r\ngardens of Sir F. Cook at _Villa Montserrate_ (3m). These last are open\r\ndaily to visitors who write their names at the entrance lodge. About 15\r\nmiles from Cintra is Mafra, with a palace, convent, and church of\r\nwonderful magnificence. An Eclipse excursionist planning a time-table\r\nfor sight-seeing between Oporto and Lisbon inclusive, and with the\r\nintention of returning to England from Lisbon, must remember that the\r\nRoyal Mail Company's boats only sail fortnightly (on Tuesdays or\r\nWednesdays) from Lisbon. The boats anchor in the river, and are reached\r\nby a steam tender.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           OPORTO TO PARIS.\r\n\r\nThis route for getting from or to possible eclipse stations in Northern\r\nSpain or Portugal is set out on the supposition that a certain number of\r\nEclipse excursionists may wish to combine the Paris Exhibition with the\r\neclipse. There is an International Express from Oporto (and Lisbon)\r\nevery Tuesday and Friday, which does the journey to Paris in 40 hours,\r\nbut no one travelling for pleasure would use this train, especially as\r\nmuch of the best scenery is traversed by night.\r\n\r\nThe journey should therefore be performed in sections, which may be made\r\nup as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                         Miles.\r\nOporto to Salamanca _viâ_ Pampilhosa        269\r\nSalamanca to Burgos                         150\r\nBurgos to Biarritz                          186\r\nBiarritz to Paris                           493\r\n\r\nUse should be made as far as possible of the International Express.\r\nWhere this is not done, and ordinary trains have to be taken, the delays\r\nare interminable and the combinations most exasperating to an\r\nEnglishman. The hotel accommodation in all the smaller towns of Spain is\r\nso universally bad that it is not easy to suggest what otherwise would\r\nseem obvious, namely, how best to subdivide, at any rate, the first\r\nthree of the above sections.\r\n\r\nThe International Express has a connection with Lisbon, the main train\r\nbeing made up or divided as the case may be at Pampilhosa Junction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LISBON TO TALAVERA AND MADRID.\r\n\r\nObservers who think they will be able to do better as regards a clear\r\nsky inland in Spain than near either the coast of Portugal or that of\r\nSpain will still find in many cases that Lisbon is their most convenient\r\nport for landing.\r\n\r\nThe chief stations on this route are:--Entroncamento Junction (67m.),\r\nMarvão (149m.), Valencia de Alcantara (159m.), *Plasencia (256m.),\r\n*Navalmoral (287m.), *Talavera de la Reina (328m.), Madrid, Delicias\r\nStat. (412m.). The places marked (*) are all within the shadow track of\r\nthe eclipse.\r\n\r\nENTRONCAMENTO (Good Buffet) is the junction station for the lines N. to\r\nOporto and S.-E. to Badajos and most trains wait here: 8m. beyond, the\r\nTagus is crossed by a fine bridge commanding good views.\r\n\r\nMARVÃO (Custom-house) is the last station in Portugal but the actual\r\nfrontier is 6m. further on. VALENCIA DE ALCANTARA (Custom-house) is the\r\nfirst station in Spain. During the next 50m. the railway passes through\r\nmuch wild mountain scenery.\r\n\r\nPLASENCIA, NAVALMORAL, and TALAVERA as eclipse stations have been\r\nmentioned on a previous page. Many celebrated struggles during the\r\nPeninsular War took place in this part of Spain, notably at Talavera in\r\n1809 and at Almaraz in 1812.\r\n\r\nMADRID (pop. 470,000; _Hotel de Paris_, _Hotel de la Paix_).\r\n\r\n\r\nGIBRALTAR TO MADRID (WITH EXCURSIONS, ON THE WAY, TO GRANADA AND\r\nSEVILLE).\r\n\r\nFrom Algeçiras (opposite Gibraltar) there runs every Wednesday an\r\nInternational Express train to Madrid and Paris. The eclipse central\r\nline crosses this route about 15m. S. of Alcazar de San Juan Junction\r\n(pop. 8400; Good Buffet, Hotel, _Casa Briseño_) which is 368m. N. of\r\nAlgeçiras and 93m. S. of Madrid.\r\n\r\nThe chief stations between Algeçiras and Madrid are:--Bobadilla Junct.\r\n(110m.), Cordova (185m.), Alcazar de San Juan (369m.), Aranjuez (430m.),\r\nand Madrid (461m.).\r\n\r\nBobadilla is a double junction. A line runs thence E. to Granada\r\n(75m.), and W. to Seville (104m.). A traveller visiting Granada must\r\nreturn to Bobadilla to get to Seville, but from Seville he can rejoin\r\nthe main line at Cordova 75m. N. of Bobadilla, and avoid Bobadilla. From\r\nSeville to Cordova is 81m.\r\n\r\nAlgeçiras is reached from Gibraltar by a local steamer. About one hour\r\nis allowed to make the connection with the train. Eclipse travellers\r\ngoing to this part of Spain who wish to take advantage of their\r\nproximity to Granada and Seville will find the following time-table\r\nusefully suggestive:--\r\n\r\nMay 16, W.    Gibraltar to Granada, 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\r\n \"  17, T.    At Granada.\r\n \"  18, F.    At Granada.\r\n \"  19, S.    Granada to Seville, 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.\r\n \"  20, Sun.  At Seville.\r\n \"  21, M.    At Seville.\r\n \"  22, Tu.   Seville to Cordova, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.\r\n \"  23, W.    At Cordova.\r\n \"  24, T.    Cordova to Alcazar, 2 a.m. to 3 p.m.\r\n \"  25, F.    At Alcazar.\r\n \"  26, S.    At Alcazar.\r\n \"  27, Sun.  At Alcazar.\r\n \"  28, M.    Eclipse day.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to the above International train there is an express from\r\nParis on Mondays reaching Algeçiras on Wednesdays. This, of course,\r\nmight suit the convenience of Eclipse travellers proposing to go to\r\nSpain _viâ_ France, and perhaps return _viâ_ Gibraltar. The time\r\noccupied by the International train between Paris and Algeçiras and\r\n_vice versâ_ is about 49 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LONDON TO ALICANTE.\r\n\r\nThe central line of the eclipse quits Spain at Cape Santa Pola about\r\n10m. S. of Alicante (pop. 40,000): it crosses the line of the Alicante\r\nand Madrid railway at Novelda (pop. 8000) a station about 20m. inland\r\nfrom Alicante.\r\n\r\nAlicante may be reached from England as follows:--(1) All sea, _viâ_\r\nGibraltar and Malaga; (2) all land, _viâ_ Paris, Biarritz and Madrid\r\n(1077m.), or Paris, Lyons and Perpignan (1126m.); or (3) part land and\r\npart sea, _viâ_ Paris and Marseilles, and thence by steamer to Barcelona\r\nand Valencia.\r\n\r\nAs regards the two land routes there is not very much to choose except\r\nthat the Biarritz-Madrid route is somewhat shorter and much quicker than\r\nthe Perpignan-Barcelona route. As regards the two sea routes both are\r\nprobably bad from the standpoint of comfort, the steamers in which the\r\nvoyage would have to be completed being Spanish coasting vessels, but it\r\nis difficult to obtain particulars of them in England.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the chief places between Paris and Alicante on\r\nthe Perpignan route:--Dijon (195m.), Lyons (318m.), Avignon (461m.),\r\nNîmes (490m.), Perpignan (623m.), Spanish frontier at Port Bou (650m.),\r\nBarcelona (758m.), Tarragona (825m.), Valencia (997m.), Alicante\r\n(1126m.). The journey from Paris to Barcelona is accomplished in 23h. by\r\nthe International Express: the remaining 368 miles take 27 hours owing\r\nto the bad connections of the trains.\r\n\r\nMadrid is 285m. from Alicante, the journey occupying about 29h.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 USEFUL BOOKS FOR PORTUGAL AND SPAIN.\r\n\r\nAs the result of much inquiry and research, the following may be\r\nsuggested:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                             GUIDE-BOOKS.\r\n\r\n_Handbook for Spain_, 2 vols. 20_s._ (J.
