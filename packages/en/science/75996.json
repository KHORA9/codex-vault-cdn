The work\r\nhere offered is the expression of a desire to close this gap in our\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nThe study of frozen sections and of material which has been hardened by\r\nintravascular injection of formalin has profoundly modified our views\r\nconcerning the natural shape of many of the viscera and has rendered\r\npossible much greater precision in topographic statements. The\r\nexperience of the author during the last ten years, in which almost all\r\nof the material used for dissection and for frozen sections in the\r\nanatomical laboratory of this University has been hardened with\r\nformalin, has demonstrated that many of the current descriptions of the\r\norgans in animals contain the same sort of errors as those which\r\nprevailed in regard to similar structures in man previous to the\r\nadoption of modern methods of preparation.\r\n\r\nWhile the method of treatment of the subject is essentially systematic,\r\ntopography is not by any means neglected either in text or\r\nillustrations; it is hoped that this will render the book of value to\r\nthe student in his clinical courses and to the practitioner.\r\nEmbryological and histological data have been almost entirely excluded,\r\nsince it was desired to offer a text-book of convenient size for the\r\nstudent and a work of ready reference for the practitioner. It is\r\nbelieved that the use of black type for the names of important\r\nstructures and of small print for certain details or matter of secondary\r\nimportance will prove useful in this respect.\r\n\r\nVeterinary anatomical nomenclature is at present quite chaotic in\r\nEnglish-speaking countries. In this work an attempt is made to eliminate\r\nsome terms which do not appear to the author to fulfil any useful\r\npurpose, and others which are clearly erroneous or otherwise\r\nundesirable. In many cases the terms agreed upon by the Congresses at\r\nBaden and Stuttgart are adopted either in the original Latin or in\r\nanglicized form; otherwise these terms are added in parenthesis. The\r\nauthor favors the substantial adoption of this terminology, but\r\nconsidered it desirable to offer a sort of transitional stage at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe original illustrations are chiefly reproductions of photographs,\r\nmany of which were taken by Mr. F. H. Haskett. The preparation of the\r\npictures for reproduction was carried out by Messrs. J. V. Alteneder and\r\nW. J. Norris. The author takes pleasure in expressing his appreciation\r\nof the care and skill exercised by these gentlemen in this often\r\ndifficult task.\r\n\r\nThe author is under great obligation to Professors Ellenberger and Baum\r\nin Dresden, to Professor Schmaltz in Berlin, and to their publishers for\r\npermission to use or to copy figures from their most excellent works.\r\nTheir generosity in this matter has made it possible to supply this text\r\nwith a larger number of high-class illustrations than is to be found in\r\nany other. A few figures have been taken from other sources, and proper\r\ncredit has been given in each case.\r\n\r\nFor checking over certain data and for assistance in the correction of\r\nthe proofs the author is much indebted to his associate, Dr. F. B.\r\nHadley.\r\n\r\nThe author desires to express his high appreciation of the determination\r\nand constant effort of the publishers to do all in their power to render\r\nthe book worthy of favorable reception by the profession for whom it is\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n      OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY, COLUMBUS, OHIO.

            INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\n=Anatomy= is the branch of biological science which deals with the form\r\nand structure of organisms, both animal and vegetal. It is therefore in\r\nclose correlation with physiology, which treats of the functions of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nEtymologically the word “anatomy” signifies the cutting apart or\r\ndisassociating of parts of the body. In the earlier phases of its\r\ndevelopment anatomy was necessarily a purely descriptive science, based\r\non such observations as were possible with the unaided eye and simple\r\ndissecting instruments—the scalpel, forceps, and the like. At this time,\r\ntherefore, the term adequately expressed the nature of the subject. But\r\nas the scope of the science extended and the body of anatomical\r\nknowledge grew, subdivisions became necessary and new terms were\r\nintroduced to designate special fields and methods of work. With the\r\nintroduction of the microscope and its accessories it became possible to\r\nstudy the finer details of structure and minute organisms hitherto\r\nunknown, and this field of inquiry rapidly developed into the science of\r\n=microscopic anatomy= or =histology= as conventionally distinguished\r\nfrom =gross= or =macroscopic anatomy=. In the same way the study of the\r\nchanges which organisms undergo during their development soon attained\r\nsufficient importance to be regarded on practical grounds as a separate\r\nbranch known as =embryology=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This term is usually limited in its application to the earlier phases\r\n  of development during which the tissues and organs are formed. The\r\n  term =ontogeny= is used to designate the entire development of the\r\n  individual. The ancestral history or =phylogeny= of the species is\r\n  constituted by the evolutionary changes which it has undergone as\r\n  disclosed by the geological record.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Comparative anatomy= is the description and comparison of the structure\r\nof animals, and forms the basis for their classification. By this\r\nmeans—including extinct forms in the scope of inquiry—it has been\r\npossible to show the genetic relationship of various groups of animals\r\nand to elucidate the significance of many facts of structure which are\r\notherwise quite obscure. The deductions concerning the general laws of\r\nform and structure derived from comparative anatomical studies\r\nconstitute the science of =morphology= or =philosophical anatomy=. The\r\nmorphologist, however, deals only with such anatomical details as are\r\nnecessary to form a basis for his generalizations. The anatomical\r\nknowledge required in the practice of medicine and surgery is evidently\r\nof a different character and must include many details which are of no\r\nparticular interest to the morphologist.\r\n\r\n=Special anatomy= is the description of the structure of a single type\r\nor species, _e. g._, anthropotomy, hippotomy.\r\n\r\n=Veterinary anatomy= is the branch which deals with the form and\r\nstructure of the principal domesticated animals. It is usually pursued\r\nwith regard to professional requirements, and is therefore largely\r\ndescriptive in character. As a matter of convenience the horse is\r\ngenerally selected as the type to be studied in detail and to form a\r\nbasis for comparison of the more essential differential characters in\r\nthe other animals.\r\n\r\nTwo chief methods of study are employed—the =systematic= and the\r\n=topographic=. In the former the body is regarded as consisting of\r\nsystems of organs or apparatus which are similar in origin and structure\r\nand are associated in the performance of certain functions.

It presupposes a fair working knowledge of systematic\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\n=Descriptive Terms.=—In order to indicate precisely the position and\r\ndirection of parts of the body, certain descriptive terms are employed,\r\nand must be understood at the outset. In the explanation of these terms\r\nit is assumed here that they apply to a quadruped such as the horse in\r\nthe ordinary standing position. The surface directed toward the plane of\r\nsupport (the ground) is termed =inferior= or =ventral=, and the opposite\r\nsurface is =superior= or =dorsal=; the relations of parts in this\r\ndirection are named accordingly. The longitudinal =median plane= divides\r\nthe body into similar halves. A structure or surface which is nearer\r\nthan another to the median plane is =internal= or =medial= to it, and an\r\nobject or surface which is further than another from the median plane is\r\n=external= or =lateral= to it. Planes parallel to the median plane are\r\n=sagittal=. =Transverse= or =segmental= planes cut the long axis of the\r\nbody perpendicular to the median plane, or an organ or limb at right\r\nangles to its long axis. A =frontal= plane is perpendicular to the\r\nmedian and transverse planes. The head end of the body is termed\r\n=anterior=, =cephalic=, or =cranial=; and the tail end =posterior= or\r\n=caudal=; relations of structures with regard to the longitudinal axis\r\nof the body are designated accordingly. Certain terms are used in a\r\nspecial sense as applied to the limbs. =Proximal= and =distal= express\r\nrelative distances of parts from the axis of the body. The anterior face\r\nof the thoracic limb from the elbow downward is also termed =dorsal=,\r\nand the opposite face =volar=. In the corresponding part of the pelvic\r\nlimb the terms are =dorsal= and =plantar= respectively. In the same\r\nregions =radial= and =ulnar= (thoracic limb), =tibial= and =fibular=\r\n(pelvic limb), may be used to designate that side of the extremity on\r\nwhich the corresponding bone is situated; they are therefore equivalent\r\nrespectively to internal or medial and external or lateral in the\r\nanimals with which we are concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is evidently advantageous to employ terms which are as far as\r\n  possible independent of the position of the body in space and capable\r\n  of general application, _e. g._, dorsal, ventral, proximal, etc. It is\r\n  also desirable that the terms internal and external be reserved to\r\n  indicate relations of depth in cavities or organs, and medial and\r\n  lateral to designate relations to the median plane. Such terms are\r\n  coming into more extensive use in human and veterinary anatomy, but\r\n  the older nomenclature is very firmly established and cannot well be\r\n  discarded at once and entirely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OSTEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE SKELETON\r\n\r\nThe term =skeleton= is applied to the framework of hard structures which\r\nsupports and protects the soft tissues of animals. In the descriptive\r\nanatomy of the higher animals it is usually restricted to the bones and\r\ncartilages, although the ligaments which bind these together might well\r\nbe included.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In zoölogy the term is used in a much more comprehensive sense, and\r\n  includes all the harder supporting and protecting structures. When the\r\n  latter are situated externally, they form an =exoskeleton=, derived\r\n  from the ectoderm. Examples of this are the shells and chitinous\r\n  coverings of many invertebrates, the scales of fishes, the shields of\r\n  turtles, and the feathers, hair, and hoofs of the higher vertebrates.\r\n  The =endoskeleton= (with which we have to deal at present) is embedded\r\n  in the soft tissues. It is derived chiefly from the mesoderm, but\r\n  includes the notochord or primitive axial skeleton, which is of\r\n  entodermal origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skeleton may be divided primarily into three parts: (1) axial; (2)\r\nappendicular; (3) splanchnic.\r\n\r\nThe =axial skeleton= comprises the vertebral column, ribs, sternum, and\r\nskull.\r\n\r\nThe =appendicular skeleton= includes the bones of the limbs.\r\n\r\nThe =splanchnic skeleton= consists of certain bones developed in the\r\nsubstance of some of the viscera or soft organs, _e. g._, the os penis\r\nof the dog and the os cordis of the ox.\r\n\r\nThe =number= of the bones of the skeleton of an animal varies with age,\r\nowing to the fusion during growth of skeletal elements which are\r\nseparate in the fœtus or the young subject. Even in adults of the same\r\nspecies numerical variations occur, _e. g._, the tarsus of the horse may\r\nconsist of six or seven bones, and the carpus of seven or eight; in all\r\nthe domestic mammals the number of coccygeal vertebræ varies\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\nThe bones are commonly divided into four classes according to their\r\nshape and function.\r\n\r\n(1) =Long bones= (Ossa longa) are typically of elongated cylindrical\r\nform with enlarged extremities. They occur in the limbs, where they act\r\nas supporting columns and as levers. The cylindrical part, termed the\r\nshaft or body (Corpus), is tubular, and incloses the =medullary cavity=,\r\nwhich contains the medulla or marrow.\r\n\r\n(2) =Flat bones= (Ossa plana) are expanded in two directions. They\r\nfurnish sufficient area for the attachment of muscles and afford\r\nprotection to the organs which they cover.\r\n\r\n(3) =Short bones= (Ossa brevia), such as those of the carpus and tarsus,\r\npresent somewhat similar dimensions in length, breadth, and thickness.\r\nTheir chief function appears to be that of diffusing concussion.\r\nSesamoid bones, which are developed in the capsules of some joints or in\r\ntendons, may be included in this group. They diminish friction or change\r\nthe direction of tendons.\r\n\r\n(4) =Irregular bones.= This group would include bones of irregular\r\nshape, such as the vertebræ and the bones of the cranial base; they are\r\nmedian and unpaired. Their functions are various and not so clearly\r\nspecialized as those of the preceding classes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This classification is not entirely satisfactory; some bones, _e. g._,\r\n  the ribs, are not clearly provided for, and others might be variously\r\n  placed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         STRUCTURE OF BONES[1]\r\n\r\nBones consist chiefly of =bone tissue=, but considered as organs they\r\npresent also an enveloping membrane, termed the =periosteum=, the\r\n=medulla= or =marrow=, =vessels=, and =nerves=.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of bone can be studied best by means of longitudinal\r\nand cross-sections. These show that the bone consists of an external\r\nshell of dense =compact substance=, within which is the more loosely\r\narranged =spongy substance=. In typical long bones the shaft is hollowed\r\nto form the =medullary cavity= (Cavum medullare).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.—FRONTAL SECTION OF LARGE METATARSAL BONE OF HORSE, POSTERIOR\r\n    PART.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF LARGE METATARSAL BONE OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _S.C._, Compact substance; _S.s._, spongy substance; _C.m._, medullary\r\n    cavity; _F.n._, nutrient foramen. Note the greater thickness of the\r\n    compact substance of the inner and anterior parts of the shaft.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =compact substance= (Substantia compacta) differs greatly in\r\nthickness in various situations, in conformity with the stresses and\r\nstrains to which the bone is subjected. In the long bones it is thickest\r\nin the middle part of the shaft and thins out toward the extremities. On\r\nthe latter the layer is very thin, and is especially dense and smooth on\r\njoint surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe =spongy substance= (Substantia spongiosa) consists of delicate bony\r\nplates and spicules which run in various directions and intercross.\r\nThese plates are definitely arranged with regard to mechanical\r\nrequirements, so that systems of pressure and tension plates can be\r\nrecognized, in conformity with the lines of pressure and the pull of\r\ntendons and ligaments respectively. The intervals (marrow spaces)\r\nbetween the plates are occupied by marrow. The spongy substance forms\r\nthe bulk of short bones and of the extremities of long bones; in the\r\nlatter it is not confined to the ends, but extends a variable distance\r\nalong the shaft also. Some bones (Ossa pneumatica) contain =air-spaces=\r\nor =sinuses= within the compact substance instead of spongy bone and\r\nmarrow. In certain situations the two compact layers of flat bones are\r\nnot separated by spongy bone, but fuse with each other; in some cases of\r\nthis kind the bone is so thin as to be translucent, or may even undergo\r\nabsorption, producing an actual deficiency.\r\n\r\nThe flat bones of the cranial vault and sides are composed of an outer\r\nlayer of ordinary compact substance, an inner layer of very dense bone,\r\nthe =tabula vitrea=, and between these a variable amount of spongy bone,\r\nhere termed =diploë=.\r\n\r\nThe =periosteum= is the membrane which invests the outer surface of\r\nbone, except where it is covered with cartilage. It consists of an outer\r\nprotective fibrous layer, and an inner cellular osteogenic layer. During\r\nactive growth the osteogenic layer is well developed, but later it\r\nbecomes much reduced. The fibrous layer varies much in thickness, being\r\nin general thickest in exposed situations. The adhesion of the\r\nperiosteum to the bone also differs greatly in various places; it is\r\nusually very thin and easily detached where it is thickly covered with\r\nmuscular tissue which has little or no attachment. The degree of\r\nvascularity conforms to the activity of the periosteum.\r\n\r\nThe =marrow= (Medulla ossium) occupies the interstices of the spongy\r\nbone and the medullary cavity of the long bones. There are two varieties\r\nin the adult—red and yellow. In the young subject there is only =red\r\nmarrow= (Medulla ossium rubra), but later this is replaced in the\r\nmedullary cavity by =yellow marrow= (Medulla ossium flava). The red\r\nmarrow contains several types of characteristic cells and is a\r\nblood-forming substance, while the yellow is practically ordinary\r\nadipose tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Since yellow marrow is formed by regressive changes in red marrow,\r\n  including fatty infiltration and degeneration of the characteristic\r\n  cells, we find transitional forms or stages in the process. In aged or\r\n  badly nourished subjects the marrow may undergo gelatinous\r\n  degeneration, resulting in the formation of gelatinous marrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—It is customary to recognize two sets of\r\n=arteries=—the =periosteal= and the =medullary=. The former ramify in\r\nthe periosteum and give off innumerable small branches which enter\r\nminute openings (Volkmann’s canals) on the surface and reach the\r\nHaversian canals of the compact substance. Other branches enter the\r\nextremities of the long bones and supply the spongy bone and marrow in\r\nthem. In the case of the larger bones—and especially the long bones—the\r\nlarge =medullary= or =nutrient artery= enters at the so-called =nutrient\r\nforamen= (Foramen nutricium), passes in a canal (Canalis nutricius)\r\nthrough the compact substance, and ramifies in the marrow; its branches\r\nanastomose with the central branches of the periosteal set. The larger\r\n=veins= of the spongy bone do not, as a rule, accompany the arteries,\r\nbut emerge chiefly near the articular surfaces. Within the bone they are\r\ndestitute of valves.\r\n\r\nThe =lymph vessels= form perivascular channels in the periosteum and the\r\nHaversian canals of the compact substance. Lymph-spaces exist at the\r\nperiphery of the marrow.\r\n\r\nThe =nerves= appear to be distributed chiefly to the blood-vessels.\r\nSpecial nerve-endings (Vater-Pacini corpuscles) in the periosteum are to\r\nbe regarded as sensory, and probably are concerned in mediating the\r\nmuscle sense (Kopsch).\r\n\r\n\r\n                   DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH OF BONE[2]\r\n\r\nThe primitive embryonal skeleton consists of cartilage and fibrous\r\ntissue, in which the bones develop. The process is termed =ossification=\r\nor =osteogenesis=, and is effected essentially by bone-producing cells,\r\ncalled =osteoblasts=. It is customary, therefore, to designate as\r\n=membrane bones= those which are developed in fibrous tissue, and as\r\n=cartilage bones= those which are preformed in cartilage. The principal\r\nmembrane bones are those of the roof and sides of the cranium and most\r\nof the bones of the face. The cartilage bones comprise, therefore, most\r\nof the skeleton. Correspondingly we distinguish =intramembranous= and\r\n=endochondral ossification=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3.—LEFT FEMUR OF YOUNG PIG, EXTERNAL VIEW, TO SHOW DIVISION OF A\r\n    LONG BONE INTO SHAFT (_s_) AND EXTREMITIES.\r\n\r\n  Proximal extremity consists of two parts, head (_h_) and trochanter\r\n    major (_t. m._), which have separate centers of ossification. Distal\r\n    extremity consists of trochlea (_t_) and condyles (_c_); _e.l._,\r\n    epiphyseal cartilages; _s.f._, supracondyloid fossa.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn intramembranous development the process begins at a definite =center\r\nof ossification= where the cells (osteoblasts) surround themselves with\r\na deposit of bone. The process extends from this center to the periphery\r\nof the future bone, thus producing a network of bony trabeculæ. The\r\ntrabeculæ rapidly thicken and coalesce, forming a bony plate which is\r\nseparated from the adjacent bones by persistent fibrous tissue. The\r\nsuperficial part of the original tissue becomes periosteum, and on the\r\ndeep face of this successive layers of periosteal bone are formed by\r\nosteoblasts until the bone attains its definitive thickness.\r\n\r\nIn endochondral ossification the process is fundamentally the same, but\r\nnot quite so simple. Osteoblasts emigrate from the deep face of the\r\nperichondrium or primitive periosteum into the cartilage and cause\r\ncalcification of the matrix or ground-substance of the latter. Vessels\r\nextend into the calcifying area, the cartilage cells shrink and\r\ndisappear, forming primary marrow cavities which are occupied by\r\nprocesses of the osteogenic tissue. There is thus formed a sort of\r\nscaffolding of calcareous trabeculæ on which the bone is constructed by\r\nthe osteoblasts. At the same time perichondral bone is formed by the\r\nosteoblasts of the primitive periosteum. The calcified cartilage is\r\nbroken down and absorbed through the agency of large cells called\r\n=osteoclasts=, and is replaced by bone deposited by the osteoblasts. The\r\nosteoclasts also cause absorption of the primitive bone, producing the\r\nmarrow cavities; thus in the case of the long bones the primitive\r\ncentral spongy bone is largely absorbed to form the medullary cavity of\r\nthe shaft, and persists chiefly in the extremities. Destruction of the\r\ncentral part and formation of subperiosteal bone continue until the\r\nshaft of the bone has completed its growth.\r\n\r\nA typical long bone is developed from three primary centers of\r\nossification, one for the diaphysis or shaft and one for each epiphysis\r\nor extremity. Many bones have secondary centers from which processes or\r\napophyses develop.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing outline accounts for the growth of bones except in regard\r\nto length. Increase in length may be explained briefly as follows:\r\nProvision for continued ossification at either end of the diaphysis is\r\nmade by a layer of actively growing cartilage—the =epiphyseal\r\ncartilage=—which intervenes between the diaphysis and the epiphysis. It\r\nis evident that so long as this cartilage persists and grows, new bone\r\nmay continue to be formed at its expense, and increase of length is\r\npossible. When the epiphyseal cartilage ceases to grow, it undergoes\r\nossification, the bone is consolidated, and no further increase in\r\nlength is possible. This fusion takes place at fairly definite periods\r\nin the various bones, and it is of value to know the usual times at\r\nwhich it occurs in the larger bones of the limbs at least.\r\n\r\n\r\n  After the bones have reached their full size, the periosteum becomes\r\n  relatively reduced and inactive so far as its osteogenic layer is\r\n  concerned; the bone-forming function may be stimulated by various\r\n  causes, as is well seen in the healing of fractures and the occurrence\r\n  of bony enlargements.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF BONE\r\n\r\nDried bone consists of =organic= and =inorganic= matter in the ratio of\r\n1 ∶ 2 approximately. The animal matter gives toughness and elasticity,\r\nthe mineral matter hardness, to the bone tissue. Removal of the organic\r\nmatter by heat does not change the general form of a bone, but reduces\r\nthe weight by about one-third, and makes it very fragile. Conversely,\r\ndecalcification, while not affecting the form and size of the bone,\r\nrenders it soft and pliable. The animal matter when boiled yields\r\ngelatin. The following table represents the composition in 100 parts of\r\nox bone of average quality:\r\n\r\n                 Gelatin                          33.30\r\n                 Phosphate of lime                57.35\r\n                 Carbonate of lime                 3.85\r\n                 Phosphate of magnesia             2.05\r\n                 Carbonate and chlorid of sodium   3.45\r\n                                                 ——————\r\n                                                 100.00\r\n\r\n\r\n                      PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF BONE\r\n\r\nFresh dead bone has a yellowish-white color; when macerated or boiled\r\nand bleached, it is white. The specific gravity of fresh compact bone is\r\na little over 1.93. It is very hard and resistant to pressure; a\r\n5-millimeter cube of compact bone of the ox will resist pressure up to\r\n852 pounds, if the pressure be applied in the line of the lamellæ\r\n(Rauber). Its tensile strength is estimated to be nearly twice that of\r\noak.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DESCRIPTIVE TERMS\r\n\r\nThe surfaces of the bones present a great variety of eminences and\r\ndepressions, as well as perforations. The prominences and cavities may\r\nbe articular, or non-articular, furnishing attachment to muscles,\r\ntendons, ligaments or fascia. A number of descriptive terms are used to\r\ndesignate these features, and the following are some of those in general\r\nuse:\r\n\r\n=Process= (Processus) is a general term for a prominence.\r\n\r\nA =tuberosity= (Tuber, Tuberositas) is a large, rounded projection; a\r\n=tubercle= (Tuberculum) is a smaller one.\r\n\r\nThe term =trochanter= is applied to a few prominences, _e. g._, the\r\ntrochanters of the femur.\r\n\r\nA =spine= (Spina) or =spinous process= (Processus spinosus) is a pointed\r\nprojection.\r\n\r\nA =crest= (Crista) is a sharp ridge.\r\n\r\nA =line= (Linea) is a very small ridge.\r\n\r\nA =head= (Caput) is a rounded articular enlargement at the end of a\r\nbone; it may be joined to the shaft by a constricted part, the =neck=\r\n(Collum).\r\n\r\nA =condyle= (Condylus) is an articular eminence which is somewhat\r\ncylindrical; a non-articular projection in connection with a condyle may\r\nbe termed an =epicondyle=.\r\n\r\nA =trochlea= is a pulley-like articular mass.\r\n\r\nA =glenoid cavity= (Cavitas glenoidalis) is a shallow articular\r\ndepression, and a =cotyloid cavity= or =acetabulum= is a deeper one.\r\n\r\nThe term =facet= is commonly applied to articular surfaces of small\r\nextent, especially when they are not strongly concave or convex.\r\n\r\nThe terms =fossa=, =fovea=, =groove= or =sulcus=, and =impression= are\r\napplied to various forms of depressions.\r\n\r\nA =foramen= is a perforation for the transmission of vessels, nerves,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nA =sinus= or =antrum= is an air-cavity.\r\n\r\nOther terms, such as =canal=, =fissure=, =notch=, etc., require no\r\nexplanation.[3]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VERTEBRAL COLUMN\r\n\r\nThe =vertebral column= (Columna vertebralis) is the fundamental part of\r\nthe skeleton. It consists of a chain of median, unpaired, irregular\r\nbones which extends from the skull to the end of the tail. In the adult\r\ncertain vertebræ have become fused to form a single bony mass with which\r\nthe pelvic girdle articulates. Vertebræ so fused are termed =fixed= or\r\n=“false” vertebræ= (Vertebræ immobiles), as distinguished from the\r\n=movable= or =“true” vertebræ= (Vertebræ mobiles).\r\n\r\nThe column is subdivided for description into =five regions=, which are\r\nnamed according to the part of the body in which they are placed. Thus\r\nthe vertebræ are designated as =cervical=, =thoracic= (or dorsal),\r\n=lumbar=, =sacral=, and =coccygeal= or =caudal= (Vertebræ cervicales,\r\nthoracales, lumbales, sacrales, coccygeæ). The number of vertebræ in a\r\ngiven species is fairly constant in each region except the last, so that\r\nthe =vertebral formula= may be expressed (for the horse, for example) as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                    C_{7}T_{18}L_{6}S_{5}Cy_{15–21}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—FIRST THORACIC VERTEBRÆ OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  To illustrate plan of structure of vertebræ.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ in a given region have special characters by which they may\r\nbe distinguished from those of other regions, and individual vertebræ\r\nhave characters which are more or less clearly recognizable. All typical\r\nvertebræ have a common plan of structure, which must first be\r\nunderstood. The parts of which a vertebra consists are the =body= or\r\n=centrum=, the =arch=, and the =processes=.\r\n\r\nThe =body= (Corpus vertebræ) is the more or less cylindrical mass on\r\nwhich the other parts are constructed. The anterior and posterior\r\nextremities of the body are attached to the adjacent vertebræ by\r\nintervertebral fibro-cartilages, and are usually convex and concave\r\nrespectively. The dorsal surface is flattened and enters into the\r\nformation of the vertebral canal, while the ventral aspect is rounded\r\nlaterally, and is in relation to various muscles and viscera. In the\r\nthoracic region the body presents two pairs of demifacets (Foveæ\r\ncostales) at the extremities for articulation with the heads of two\r\npairs of ribs.\r\n\r\nThe =arch= (Arcus vertebræ) is constructed on the dorsal aspect of the\r\nbody. It consists originally of two lateral halves, each of which is\r\nconsidered to consist of a pedicle and a lamina. The pedicles form the\r\nlateral parts of the arch, and are cut into in front and behind by the\r\n=vertebral notches= (Incisura vertebralis cranialis, caudalis). The\r\nnotches of two adjacent vertebræ form =intervertebral foramina= for the\r\npassage of the spinal nerves and vessels; in some vertebræ, however,\r\nthese are complete foramina instead of notches. The laminæ are plates\r\nwhich complete the arch dorsally, uniting with each other medially at\r\nthe root of the spinous process.\r\n\r\nThe body and the arch form a bony ring which incloses the =vertebral\r\nforamen= (Foramen vertebrale); the series of vertebral rings, together\r\nwith the ligaments which unite them, inclose the =vertebral canal=\r\n(Canalis vertebralis), which contains the spinal cord and its coverings\r\nand vessels.\r\n\r\nThe =articular processes=, two =anterior= and two =posterior= (Processus\r\narticulares craniales, caudales), project from the borders of the arch\r\non either side. They present joint surfaces adapted to those of adjacent\r\nvertebræ, and the remaining surface is roughened for muscular and\r\nligamentous attachment.\r\n\r\nThe =spinous process= (Processus spinosus) is single, and projects\r\ndorsally from the middle of the arch. It varies greatly in form, size,\r\nand direction in different vertebræ. It furnishes attachment to muscles\r\nand ligaments.\r\n\r\nThe =transverse processes= (Processus transversi) are two in number and\r\nproject laterally from the side of the arch, or from the junction of the\r\narch and body. In the thoracic region each has a facet for articulation\r\nwith the tubercle of a rib (Fovea costalis transversalis). They also\r\ngive attachment to muscles and ligaments.\r\n\r\nSome vertebræ have also a =ventral= or =hæmal spine=.\r\n\r\n=Mammillary processes= (Processus mammillares) are found in most animals\r\non the last thoracic and anterior lumbar vertebræ between the transverse\r\nand anterior articular processes or on the latter.\r\n\r\n=Accessory processes= (Processus accessorii), when present, are situated\r\nbetween the transverse and posterior articular processes.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The vertebræ are developed by ossification in the\r\ncartilage which surrounds the notochord and forms the sides of the\r\nneural canal. There are =three primary centers of ossification=, one for\r\nthe body and one for each side of the arch. =Secondary centers= appear\r\nlater for the summit of the spinous process (except in the cervical\r\nregion), the extremities of the transverse processes, and the thin\r\nepiphyseal plates at the extremities of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sometimes there are at first two centers for the body which soon fuse.\r\n  The process of ossification extends from the lateral centers to form\r\n  not only the corresponding part of the arch, but also the processes\r\n  and a part of the body next to the root of the arch (Radix arcus). In\r\n  the horse and ox the body and arch are usually fused at birth, but the\r\n  epiphyses do not fuse till growth is complete. In the pig, sheep, and\r\n  dog the body and arch are united at birth by cartilage (neurocentral\r\n  synchondrosis), but fuse in the first few months.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE RIBS\r\n\r\nThe ribs (Costæ) are elongated curved bones which form the skeleton of\r\nthe lateral thoracic walls. They are arranged serially in pairs which\r\nusually correspond in number to the thoracic vertebræ. Each articulates\r\ndorsally with the spine and is continued ventrally by a =costal\r\ncartilage=. Those which articulate with the sternum by means of their\r\ncartilages are termed =sternal= or =“true” ribs= (Costæ sternales s.\r\nveræ); the remainder are =asternal= or =“false” ribs= (Costæ asternales\r\ns. spuriæ). Ribs at the end of the series which have their ventral ends\r\nfree in the abdominal wall are named =floating ribs= (Costæ\r\nfluctuantes). The intervals between the ribs are termed =intercostal\r\nspaces= (Spatia intercostalia).\r\n\r\nA typical rib[4] consists of a =shaft= and two =extremities=. The\r\n=shaft= (Corpus costæ) is band-like and varies much in length, breadth,\r\nand curvature. In the case of some ribs the curvature is not uniform,\r\nbut is most accentuated at a certain point, termed the =angle of the\r\nrib= (Angulus costæ); this occurs at a variable distance from the\r\nvertebral end, and is usually marked by a rough ridge. The direction\r\nalso varies; the first rib is almost vertical, while the remainder slope\r\nbackward in increasing degree. The =external= surface is convex, and the\r\n=internal= flattened from edge to edge; on the latter, close to the\r\nposterior border, is the =costal groove= (Sulcus costalis), which fades\r\nout ventrally. It contains the intercostal vein. The =anterior= and\r\n=posterior borders= are thin and sharp on some ribs, rounded on others.\r\n\r\nThe =vertebral extremity= (Extremitas vertebralis) consists of the\r\n=head=, =neck=, and =tubercle=. The =head= (Capitulum costæ) is the\r\nactual end of the rib, and is rounded and somewhat enlarged. It presents\r\ntwo facets (Facies articularis capituli costæ) for articulation with the\r\nbodies of two adjacent thoracic vertebræ; these surfaces are separated\r\nby a groove in which the conjugal ligament is attached. The =neck=\r\n(Collum costæ) joins the head to the shaft. It varies in length and\r\ndiameter. Its outer surface is rough, its inner smooth. The =tubercle=\r\n(Tuberculum costæ) projects backward at the junction of the neck and\r\nshaft. It has a facet (Facies articularis tuberculi costæ) for\r\narticulation with the transverse process of the posterior vertebra of\r\nthe two with which the head articulates. The tubercle gradually\r\napproaches the head in the posterior ribs, and eventually fuses with it.\r\n\r\nThe =sternal extremity= (Extremitas sternalis) is commonly slightly\r\nenlarged, and has a rough depression in which the costal cartilage is\r\nembedded.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The ribs are ossified in cartilage from three centers—one\r\neach for the shaft (and sternal end), head, and tubercle; the third\r\ncenter does not occur in the last two ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COSTAL CARTILAGES\r\n\r\nThese (Cartilagines costales) are bars of hyaline cartilage which\r\ncontinue the ribs. Those of the sternal ribs articulate with the\r\nsternum, while the remainder overlap and are attached to each other to\r\nform the =costal arch= (Arcus costalis).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE STERNUM\r\n\r\nThe =sternum= or breast-bone is a median segmental bone which completes\r\nthe skeleton of the thorax ventrally, and articulates with the\r\ncartilages of the sternal ribs laterally. It consists of six to eight\r\nbony segments (Sternebræ) connected by intervening cartilage in the\r\nyoung subject. Its form varies with that of the thorax in general and\r\nwith the development of the clavicles in animals in which they are\r\npresent. Its anterior extremity, the =manubrium sterni= or =presternum=,\r\nis specially affected by the latter factor, being broad and strong when\r\nthe clavicles are well developed and articulate with it (as in man),\r\nrelatively small and laterally compressed when they are absent (as in\r\nthe horse) or rudimentary (as in the dog). The cartilages of the first\r\npair of ribs articulate with it. The =body= or =mesosternum= (Corpus\r\nsterni) presents laterally, at the junction of the segments, concave\r\nfacets (Incisuræ costales) for articulation with the cartilages of the\r\nsternal ribs. The posterior extremity or =metasternum= presents the\r\n=xiphoid= (or ensiform) =cartilage= (Processus xiphoideus); this is thin\r\nand plate-like, as in the horse and ox, or narrow and short, as in the\r\npig and dog.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The cartilaginous sternum is formed by the fusion\r\nmedially of two lateral bars which unite the ventral ends of the first\r\neight or nine costal cartilages, and is primitively unsegmented. The\r\nmanubrium ossifies from a single center, but the centers for the other\r\nsegments appear to be primitively paired. The sternum never becomes\r\ncompletely ossified; details in regard to persisting cartilage will be\r\ngiven in the special descriptions. The layer of compact tissue is for\r\nthe greater part very thin and the spongy substance is open-meshed and\r\nvery vascular.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE THORAX\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the thorax comprises the thoracic vertebræ dorsally, the\r\nribs and their cartilages laterally, and the sternum ventrally. The\r\n=thoracic cavity= (Cavum thoracis) resembles in shape an irregular\r\ntruncated cone; it is compressed laterally, especially in front, and the\r\ndorsal wall or roof is much longer than the ventral wall or floor. The\r\n=anterior aperture= (Apertura thoracis cranialis) is bounded by the\r\nfirst thoracic vertebra dorsally, the first pair of ribs and their\r\ncartilages laterally, and the manubrium sterni ventrally. The =posterior\r\naperture= (Apertura thoracis caudalis) is bounded by the last thoracic\r\nvertebra, the last pair of ribs, the costal arches, and the anterior\r\npart of the xiphoid cartilage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It may be noted here that the diaphragm (which forms the partition\r\n  between the thoracic and abdominal cavities) does not follow the\r\n  costal arches in its posterior attachment, so that the posterior ribs\r\n  enter also into the formation of the abdominal wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE SKULL\r\n\r\nThe term skull is usually understood to include all of the bones of the\r\nhead. The head consists of the cranium and the face, and it is therefore\r\nconvenient to divide the bones into cranial and facial groups.\r\n\r\nThe =cranial bones= (Ossa cranii) inclose the brain with its membranes\r\nand vessels and the essential organs of hearing. They concur with the\r\nfacial bones in forming the orbital and nasal cavities, in which the\r\nperipheral organs of sight and of smell are situated.\r\n\r\nThe =facial bones= (Ossa faciei) form the skeleton of the oral and nasal\r\ncavities, and also support the larynx and the root of the tongue.\r\n\r\nMost of the bones of the skull are flat bones, developed in membrane;\r\nthose of the cranial base may be classed as irregular, and are cartilage\r\nbones. Only two form permanent movable joints with other parts of the\r\nskull. The mandible or lower jaw-bone forms diarthrodial joints with the\r\ntemporal bones, and the hyoid bone is attached to the latter by bars of\r\ncartilage. The other bones form immovable joints, most of which\r\ndisappear with age.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In order to study the separate bones, skulls of young subjects are\r\n  necessary, since later most of the lines of demarcation become\r\n  effaced. The relations of each bone to its surroundings should be\r\n  specially noted, since the final object is to understand the skull as\r\n  a whole. In the descriptions which follow the skull is considered with\r\n  its long axis horizontal, and that of the horse will serve as a type.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE BONES OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe thoracic limb consists of four chief segments, viz., the shoulder\r\ngirdle, the arm, the forearm, and the forefoot or manus.\r\n\r\nThe =shoulder girdle= (Cingulum extremitatis thoracicæ), when fully\r\ndeveloped, consists of three bones—the =scapula= or shoulder-blade, the\r\n=coracoid=, and the =clavicle= or collar-bone. In the domesticated\r\nmammals only the scapula, a large, flat bone, is well developed, and the\r\nsmall coracoid element has fused with it, while the clavicle is either\r\nabsent or is a small rudiment embedded in the mastoido-humeralis muscle.\r\nThere is therefore no articulation of the shoulder with the axial\r\nskeleton.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The shoulder girdle is fully developed in birds and the lower mammals\r\n  (monotremata). In the higher mammals the coracoid is reduced to the\r\n  coracoid process of the scapula, and the development of the clavicle\r\n  is in conformity with the function of the limb. Thus in typical\r\n  quadrupeds, such as the horse and ox, in which the forelimbs are used\r\n  only for support and locomotion, the clavicle is absent. Other animals\r\n  which use these limbs for grasping, burrowing, climbing, etc. (_e.g._,\r\n  man, apes, moles), have well-developed clavicles which connect the\r\n  scapula with the sternum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =arm= (Brachium) contains a single long bone, the humerus or arm\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nIn the =forearm= (Antibrachium) are two long bones, the =radius= and\r\n=ulna=. These vary in relative size and mobility. In the horse and ox\r\nthe two bones are fused, and the lower part of the limb is fixed in the\r\nposition of pronation. The radius is placed in front and supports the\r\nweight. The ulna is well developed only in its upper part, which forms a\r\nlever for the extensor muscles of the elbow. In the pig the ulna is the\r\nlarger and longer of the two bones, but is closely attached to the back\r\nof the radius. In the dog the ulna is also well developed and a small\r\namount of movement is possible between the two bones.\r\n\r\nThe =forefoot= or =hand= (Manus) consists of three subdivisions, viz.,\r\nthe =carpus=, =metacarpus=, and =digit= or =digits=.\r\n\r\nThe =carpus=, popularly termed the “knee” in animals, and homologous\r\nwith the wrist of man, contains a group of short bones (Ossa carpi).\r\nThese are typically eight in number and are arranged in two transverse\r\nrows—a proximal or antibrachial, and a distal or metacarpal. The bones\r\nof the proximal row, named from the radial to the ulnar side (_i. e._,\r\nfrom within outward), are the =radial=, =intermediate=, =ulnar=, and\r\n=accessory= carpal bones. The bones of the distal row are designated\r\nnumerically, in the same direction, as =first=, =second=, =third=, and\r\n=fourth= carpal bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This nomenclature, introduced by Gegenbaur, and now used largely by\r\n  comparative anatomists, seems decidedly preferable to the variety of\r\n  terms borrowed from human anatomy and based on the form of the bones\r\n  in man. The following table of synonyms in common use is appended for\r\n  comparison. The Latin terms and abbreviated notations are given in\r\n  parenthesis.\r\n\r\n           Radial (Os carpi radiale, Cr)           Scaphoid\r\n           Intermediate (Os carpi intermedium, Ci) Semilunar\r\n           Ulnar (Os carpi ulnare, Cu)             Cuneiform\r\n           Accessory (Os carpi accessorium, Ca)    Pisiform\r\n           First carpal (Os carpale primum, C1)    Trapezium\r\n           Second carpal (Os carpale secundum, C2) Trapezoid\r\n           Third carpal (Os carpale tertium, C3)   Os magnum\r\n           Fourth carpal (Os carpale quartum, C4)  Unciform\r\n\r\n  The central carpal bone (Os carpi centrale) is omitted, since it is\r\n  not a separate element in the animals under consideration here.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =metacarpus= contains typically five =metacarpal bones= (Ossa\r\nmetacarpalia I–V), one for each digit; they are long bones and are\r\ndesignated numerically from within outward. This arrangement occurs in\r\nthe dog, although the first metacarpal is much smaller than the others,\r\nand the second and fifth are somewhat reduced. Further reduction has\r\ntaken place in the other animals, resulting in the perissodactyl and\r\nartiodactyl forms. In the horse the first and fifth metacarpals are\r\nabsent, the third is the large supporting metacarpal bone and carries\r\nthe single digit, while the second and fourth are much reduced. In\r\nartiodactyls (_e. g._, ox, sheep, pig) the third and fourth are the\r\nchief metacarpals and carry the well developed digits; they are fused in\r\nthe ox and sheep. The others are variously reduced or absent as noted in\r\nthe special descriptions to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fossil remains of the ancestors of the existing Equidæ illustrate\r\n  in a most complete manner the reduction which has occurred in this\r\n  respect. The earliest known ancestor of the horse, Eohippus or\r\n  Hyracotherium of the Lower Eocene, had four well developed metacarpal\r\n  bones, each of which carried a digit; the first metacarpal bone was\r\n  small. Eleven intermediate stages show the gradual evolution of the\r\n  race from this primitive animal, which was about the size of the\r\n  domestic cat. There is reason to believe that earlier forms had five\r\n  digits.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =digits= (Digiti manus) are homologous with the fingers of man, and\r\nare typically five in number. They are designated numerically from the\r\nradial to the ulnar side, in correspondence with the metacarpus. The\r\nfull number is present in the dog. In the ox and pig the third and\r\nfourth are well developed and support the weight, while the second and\r\nfifth are reduced. The existing horse has a single digit, the third of\r\nhis polydactyl ancestors. The skeleton of each fully developed digit\r\nconsists of three =phalanges= and certain =sesamoid bones=. The =first=\r\nor =proximal phalanx= (Phalanx prima) articulates with the corresponding\r\nmetacarpal bone above and with the =second= or =middle phalanx= (Phalanx\r\nsecunda) below. The =third= or =distal phalanx= (Phalanx tertia) is\r\ninclosed in the hoof or claw, and is modified to conform to the latter.\r\nThe =sesamoid bones= (Ossa sesamoidea) are developed along the course of\r\nthe flexor tendons or in the joint capsules. Two =proximal sesamoids=\r\n(Ossa sesamoidea phalangis primæ) occur at the flexor side of the\r\nmetacarpo-phalangeal joint and form a pulley for the flexor tendon. The\r\n=distal sesamoids= (Ossa sesamoidea phalangis tertiæ) are similarly\r\nplaced between the deep flexor tendon and the joint between the second\r\nand third phalanx; they are absent in the dog, which has a small\r\nsesamoid on the extensor side of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, and\r\noften at the proximal interphalangeal joint also.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Numerous cases are recorded of the occurrence of supernumerary digits\r\n  (hyperdactylism) in the horse and other animals. In some pigs, on the\r\n  other hand, the two chief digits are fused, and the condition appears\r\n  to be inherited.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE BONES OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe pelvic limb, like the thoracic, consists of four segments, viz., the\r\npelvic girdle, thigh, leg, and the hind foot or pes; the last is\r\nsubdivided into tarsus, metatarsus, and digits.\r\n\r\nThe =pelvic girdle= (Cingulum extremitatis pelvinæ) consists of the =os\r\ncoxæ= or hip bone, which joins its fellow of the opposite side ventrally\r\nat the symphysis pelvis, and articulates very firmly with the sacrum\r\ndorsally. The two coxal bones, together with the sacrum and the first\r\ntwo or three coccygeal vertebræ, constitute the bony pelvis. The os coxæ\r\nconsists originally of three flat bones, the =ilium=, =ischium=, and\r\n=pubis=, which meet at the acetabulum, a large cotyloid cavity that\r\narticulates with the head of the femur. These three parts are fused\r\nbefore growth is complete, but are considered separately for convenience\r\nof description. The =ilium= (Os ilium) is situated in the lateral wall\r\nof the pelvis, the =pubis= (Os pubis) in the anterior part, and the\r\n=ischium= (Os ischii) in the posterior part of the ventral wall.\r\n\r\nThe =thigh= (Femur), like the arm, contains a single large, long bone,\r\nthe =femur= or thigh bone (Os femoris). This articulates with the\r\nacetabulum above and the tibia and patella below.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the leg (Crus) comprises three bones (Ossa cruris),\r\nviz., the =tibia=, =fibula=, and =patella=. The =tibia= is a large\r\nprismatic long bone which supports the weight, and articulates below\r\nwith the tibial tarsal bone. The =fibula= is situated along the outer\r\nborder of the tibia, from which it is separated by the =interosseous\r\nspace= of the leg. It is much more slender than the tibia and does not\r\narticulate with the femur. In the pig and dog it has a complete shaft\r\nand two extremities, but in the horse and ox it is much reduced and\r\notherwise modified. The =patella= or “knee-cap” is a short bone which\r\narticulates with the trochlea of the distal end of the femur; it is to\r\nbe regarded as a large sesamoid bone intercalated in the tendon of the\r\nquadriceps femoris muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =tarsus= or “hock” consists of a group of short bones (Ossa tarsi)\r\nnumbering five to seven in the different animals. The proximal or crural\r\nrow consists of two bones, the =tibial= and =fibular tarsals=; the\r\nformer is situated at the inner or tibial side, and has a trochlea for\r\narticulation with the distal end of the tibia; the latter, situated\r\nexternally, has a process, the =tuber calcis=, which projects upward and\r\nbackward and constitutes a lever for the muscles which extend the hock\r\njoint. The distal or metatarsal row consists of four bones when seven\r\ntarsal elements are present, as in the pig and dog. They are best\r\ndesignated numerically as =first tarsal=, =second tarsal=, etc. The\r\n=central tarsal= is interposed between the rows.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The preceding terms are anglicized abbreviations of those introduced\r\n  by Gegenbaur into comparative anatomy. The Latin names and synonyms\r\n  are given in the following table.\r\n\r\n  Tibial (Os tarsi tibiale, Tt.)          Astragalus or Talus\r\n  Fibular (Os tarsi fibulare, Tf.)

The\r\n=third=, =fourth=, and =fifth= are typical, and have the following\r\ncharacters:\r\n\r\n1. The =bodies= are long as compared with those of other vertebræ. Each\r\npresents a median =ventral spine= or =crest=, which becomes more\r\nprominent as it is traced backward, and is tuberculate at its posterior\r\nend. The =lateral aspect= is concave. The =dorsal surface= has a flat\r\ncentral area which is narrow in the middle of the vertebræ, and wide at\r\neither end; it gives attachment to the superior common ligament. On\r\neither side of this area is a groove which lodges the longitudinal\r\nspinal vein. These lateral grooves are connected at the middle of the\r\nsurface by a transverse furrow, in which there are several foramina\r\nthrough which veins emerge from the spongy substance of the body. The\r\n=anterior extremity= presents a head which has an oval articular\r\nsurface, strongly convex, and wider above than below. The =posterior\r\nextremity= is larger and has a nearly circular cotyloid cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.—LAST CERVICAL AND FIRST THORACIC VERTEBRÆ OF HORSE, LATERAL\r\n    VIEW.

The\r\nvertebral notches are large.\r\n\r\n3. The =articular processes= are large. Their articular surfaces are\r\nextensive, oval in outline, and slightly concave; the anterior ones are\r\ndirected upward and inward, the posterior downward and outward. The\r\nremaining surface is mainly roughened for ligamentous and muscular\r\nattachment. A crest connects the articular processes of the same side on\r\nthe fourth and fifth; on the third it does not reach the anterior\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n4. The =transverse processes= are large and plate-like. Each arises by\r\ntwo roots, one from the arch and one from the body; between these is the\r\n=foramen transversarium=, through which the vertebral artery passes. The\r\nprocess divides externally into anterior and posterior branches, which\r\nare thickened and rough for muscular attachment.\r\n\r\n5. The =spinous process= is represented by a crest (Crista spinosa),\r\nwhich widens behind, and is connected by ridges with the posterior\r\narticular processes.\r\n\r\nThe =sixth= cervical vertebra has the following distinctive features: It\r\nis shorter and wider than the fifth. The =arch= is large, especially\r\nposteriorly. The =posterior articular= processes are shorter, thicker\r\nand further apart; they are connected with the anterior ones by a thick\r\nridge. The =spinous process= is less rudimentary; it is half an inch or\r\nmore (ca. 1.5 cm.) in height. The =transverse processes= have three\r\nbranches; the third part is a thick, almost sagittal plate, which forms\r\nwith its fellow and the body a wide ventral groove on the posterior part\r\nof the vertebra; the other branches correspond to those of the typical\r\nvertebræ, but are short and thicker. The =foramen transversarium= is\r\nlarge; below its posterior end is a fossa. The =ventral crest= is small\r\nand is less prominent posteriorly.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The third branch of the transverse process and the fossa are sometimes\r\n  absent on one side.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =seventh= cervical vertebra is readily distinguished by the\r\nfollowing characters: It is =shorter= and =wider= than the others. The\r\n=body= is flattened dorso-ventrally and wide, especially behind; here it\r\nhas a =demifacet= on either side for articulation with part of the head\r\nof the first rib. The =arch= and its =notches= are large. The =anterior\r\narticular processes= are wider and longer than the posterior pair. The\r\n=spinous process= is an inch or more (ca. 3 cm.) in height. The\r\n=transverse process= is undivided, and has no foramen transversarium.\r\nThe ventral crest is replaced by a pair of tubercles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some specimens a large foramen transversarium is present on one\r\n  side or (rarely) on both.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.—ATLAS OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat.\r\n    d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10.—ATLAS OF HORSE, POSTERIOR VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d.\r\n    Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE ATLAS\r\n\r\nThis vertebra is decidedly atypical in form and structure. The body and\r\nspinous process are absent. It has the form of a strong ring, from which\r\ntwo curved plates, the =wings=, project laterally. The ring incloses a\r\nvery large vertebral foramen, and consists of two =lateral masses=\r\nconnected by =dorsal= and =ventral arches=.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral masses= (Massæ laterales) present two deep oval =anterior\r\narticular cavities= (Foveæ articulares craniales) which receive the\r\noccipital condyles; they are separated by a wide notch above and a\r\nnarrow one below. The outer margin is also notched, and a triangular\r\nnon-articular depression cuts into the inner part of each cavity. The\r\n=posterior articular surfaces= (Facies articulares caudales) are\r\nsomewhat saddle-shaped; they are confluent on the ventral arch below,\r\nbut are widely separated above, and do not conform in shape to the\r\ncorresponding surfaces of the axis.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal arch= (Arcus dorsalis) presents a median =dorsal tubercle=\r\n(Tuberculum dorsale) and is concave below. It is perforated on either\r\nside near its anterior margin by the =intervertebral foramen=. The\r\n=anterior border= is deeply notched, and the =posterior= is thin and\r\nconcave.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral arch= (Arcus ventralis) is thicker, narrower, and less\r\ncurved than the dorsal. On its lower surface is the =ventral tubercle=\r\n(Tuberculum ventrale), into which the terminal tendon of the longus\r\ncolli muscle is inserted. The upper face has posteriorly a transversely\r\nconcave articular surface (Fovea dentis), on which the dens or odontoid\r\nprocess of the axis rests. In front of this is a transverse rough\r\nexcavation for the attachment of the odontoid ligament.\r\n\r\nThe =wings= (Alæ) are modified transverse processes. They are extensive\r\ncurved plates which project outward, downward, and backward from the\r\nlateral masses. The dorsal surface is concave. Between the ventral\r\naspect of the wing and the lateral mass is a cavity, the =fossa\r\natlantis=; in this there is a foramen which opens into the vertebral\r\ncanal. The =border= is thick and rough. Two foramina perforate each\r\nwing. The anterior one, the =foramen alare=, is connected with the\r\nintervertebral foramen by a short groove. The posterior one is the\r\n=foramen transversarium=.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The atlas ossifies from =three= or =four centers=, one or\r\ntwo for the ventral arch, and one on either side for each lateral mass,\r\nwing, and half of the dorsal arch. At birth the bone consists of three\r\npieces—the ventral arch and two lateral parts, which are separated by a\r\nlayer of cartilage in the dorsal median line. These parts are usually\r\nfused at about six months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.—FIRST THREE CERVICAL VERTEBRÆ OF HORSE, LATERAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE AXIS\r\n\r\nThe =axis= (Epistropheus) is the longest of the vertebræ, and is\r\ncharacterized by the presence of the odontoid process, which projects\r\nfrom the anterior part of the body.\r\n\r\nThe =body= has a median ventral crest which terminates in a tubercle\r\nbehind. The anterior extremity presents centrally the =odontoid process=\r\n(Dens); this has a convex articular surface ventrally for articulation\r\nwith the ventral arch of the atlas, and two rough depressions for the\r\nattachment of the odontoid ligament dorsally. Flanking this on either\r\nside are the modified =anterior articular processes=, which have\r\nsaddle-shaped articular surfaces confluent below with that of the dens.\r\nThe posterior extremity has the usual cavity.\r\n\r\nThe =arch= presents in the young subject a notch on each side of its\r\nanterior border; this is converted into a foramen by a ligament which\r\nusually ossifies later. The posterior border has the usual notches.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior articular processes= are typical.\r\n\r\nThe =transverse processes= are small, single, and project backward. The\r\n=foramen transversarium= is small.\r\n\r\nThe =spinous process= is very large and strong. Its free border is\r\nrough, thickens posteriorly, and is continued to the articular processes\r\nby two ridges. The lateral surfaces are concave and rough for muscular\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The axis has =six= or =seven centers= of ossification. In\r\naddition to the usual five, one or two appear for the dens, which is\r\nregarded as the displaced body of the atlas. A nucleus behind the dens,\r\nwhich remains distinct to three or four years of age, is considered by\r\nLesbre to be the head of the axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.—OCCIPITAL BONE AND FIRST THREE CERVICAL VERTEBRÆ OF HORSE,\r\n    DORSAL VIEW.

As regional\r\ncharacters we note the surfaces for articulation with the ribs and the\r\nlength and form of the spinous processes. Those in the middle of the\r\nseries are the most typical and present the following features:\r\n\r\n1. The =bodies= are short and constricted in the middle. The ends are\r\nexpanded and have articular surfaces which are not strongly curved. On\r\nthe upper part of each side are anterior and posterior =costal facets=\r\n(Fovea costalis cranialis, caudalis), which, with those of adjacent\r\nvertebræ, form sockets for the heads of the ribs.\r\n\r\n2. The =arches= are small. Their posterior notches are relatively large\r\nand are often converted into foramina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 13.—THIRD, FOURTH, AND FIFTH THORACIC VERTEBRÆ OF HORSE, LATERAL\r\n    VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n3. The =articular processes= are small. The anterior pair are in fact\r\nrepresented only by two oval facets on the anterior part of the laminæ\r\nwhich face almost directly upward. The posterior pair spring from the\r\nbase of the spinous process; their facets face almost directly downward.\r\n\r\n4. The =transverse processes= are short, thick, and tuberous at the free\r\nend. Each has a =facet= (Fovea transversaria) for articulation with the\r\ntuberosity of the rib which has the same serial number.\r\n\r\n5. The =spinous process= is large, narrow, and slopes upward and\r\nbackward. The anterior border is thin, the posterior wider and furrowed.\r\nThe summit is expanded and rough.\r\n\r\nThe =first thoracic vertebra= is easily recognized by the following\r\nspecific characters: The body is wide and flattened dorso-ventrally. In\r\nfront it has a head like the cervical vertebræ, and behind a cavity\r\nsomewhat deeper than any other thoracic vertebra. Two =costal facets=\r\nare found on either side, and a well-marked spine ventrally. The =arch=\r\nis large and strong, and has large notches. The =articular processes=\r\nare much larger than those of other thoracic vertebræ, and resemble a\r\ngood deal those of the seventh cervical in form. The =transverse\r\nprocesses= are short and thick, and each has on its ventral aspect a\r\nlarge concave facet for articulation with the tubercle of the first rib.\r\nThe spinous process is curved backward and tapers to a point. Its length\r\nis usually about three or four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.). It may be\r\nmistaken at first glance for the last cervical, but is promptly\r\nidentified by the three costal facets on each side and the length of the\r\nspine.\r\n\r\nThe =last thoracic vertebra= is distinguished by the absence of the\r\nposterior pair of costal facets, and the confluence of the anterior pair\r\nwith those on the transverse processes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 14.—THIRD THORACIC VERTEBRÆ AND UPPER PART OF RIB OF HORSE,\r\n    ANTERIOR VIEW.

Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe serial position of others may be determined at least approximately\r\nby the following data: (1) The bodies gradually diminish in length and\r\nwidth to the middle of the region and then increase slightly. Their\r\ncostal facets become smaller and less concave from first to last. The\r\nventral crest is distinct on three or four vertebræ at either end of the\r\nregion. (2) The transverse processes diminish in size and are placed\r\nlower down as they are traced backward. Their costal facets become\r\nsmaller and lower in position; on the last (and sometimes on its\r\npredecessor also) it fuses with the costal facet of the body. The upper\r\nnon-articular part of the process gradually becomes more sharply\r\ndefined, and in the last four or five separates to form the =mammillary\r\nprocess=. (3) The spinous processes increase in length to the third and\r\nfourth, and then gradually diminish to the fifteenth, beyond which they\r\nhave about the same length. The backward inclination is most pronounced\r\nin the second, the sixteenth is vertical, and the last two are directed\r\na little forward. The longest spines (_i. e._, those of the withers) are\r\nthe thickest and have expanded summits which remain more or less\r\ncartilaginous; the others are more plate-like, and are surmounted by a\r\nthick lip. The second spine is more than twice as large as the first.\r\nThe summits of the fourth and fifth usually form the highest point of\r\nthe withers.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—There are =six= or =seven centers=, three for the body,\r\ntwo for the arch, and one for the spinous process; some of the latter\r\nhave an additional center for the summit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE LUMBAR VERTEBRÆ\r\n\r\nThe =lumbar vertebræ= (Vertebræ lumbales) are usually six in number in\r\nthe horse. They are characterized by the size and form of their\r\ntransverse processes.\r\n\r\nThe =bodies= of the first three are triangular on cross-section, and\r\npresent a distinct ventral crest. From the fourth backward they become\r\nwider and flatter and the ventral crest fades out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.—FIRST THORACIC VERTEBRA AND UPPER PART OF FIRST RIB OF HORSE,\r\n    ANTERIOR VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =arches= of the first two or three are about equal in size and\r\nsimilar to that of the last thoracic; from the fourth they decrease\r\nnoticeably in breadth and height.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.—LAST TWO THORACIC AND FIRST LUMBAR VERTEBRÆ OF HORSE, LATERAL\r\n    VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =anterior articular processes= are fused with the mammillary\r\nprocesses, and present superiorly concave surfaces for articulation with\r\nthe posterior pair of the preceding vertebra. The =posterior articular\r\nprocesses= project distinctly from the arch at the base of the spinous\r\nprocess, and have ventrally convex articular surfaces, which fit into\r\nthe grooved surfaces of the anterior pair of the next vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe =transverse processes= are large plates, flattened dorso-ventrally,\r\nwhich project outward and usually curve slightly downward; their length\r\nincreases to the third and fourth, and then diminishes to the last,\r\nwhich is the shortest. The first one or two usually curve somewhat\r\nbackward, the last two decidedly forward. Those of the fifth have an\r\noval concave facet on the inner part of the posterior border for\r\narticulation with the sixth process; the latter has a corresponding\r\nconvex facet on the anterior border, and a larger concave surface on the\r\nposterior border for articulation with the wing of the sacrum. Sometimes\r\nthe fifth process has a small surface for articulation with the fourth.\r\nThe inner part of the sixth process is thick, the outer part thinner,\r\nnarrower, and curved forward. The inner part of the fifth is also\r\nsomewhat thickened.\r\n\r\nThe =spinous processes= resemble those of the last two thoracic\r\nvertebræ. They are usually about equal in height, but minor differences\r\nare common, and the width diminishes in the last three.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—This is similar to that of the thoracic vertebræ. The\r\nextremities of the transverse processes remain cartilaginous for some\r\ntime after ossification is otherwise complete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.—SECOND LUMBAR VERTEBRA OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The transverse processes of this region are considered equivalent to\r\n  the proper transverse process + the costal element, and hence the\r\n  distinctive term processus lateralis (s. costarius) has been proposed.\r\n  The occurrence of a lumbar rib in connection with the transverse\r\n  process of the first lumbar is not rare. Reduction of the number to\r\n  five has been observed frequently, and may or may not be compensated\r\n  by an additional thoracic vertebra. This variation is not more common\r\n  in certain races as Sanson and others have maintained. Very few cases\r\n  are recorded of seven lumbar vertebræ—especially with the normal\r\n  thoracic number. An anomalous vertebra with mixed thoracic and lumbar\r\n  characters sometimes occurs at the junction of the two regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE SACRUM\r\n\r\nThe =sacrum= (Os sacrum) is formed by the fusion of five vertebræ\r\nusually, and is conveniently described as a single bone. It is\r\ntriangular in form and is wedged in between the ilia, with which it\r\narticulates very firmly on each side. Its long axis is gently curved,\r\nand slightly oblique, so that the posterior end is a little higher than\r\nthe anterior. It presents two surfaces, two borders, a base, and an\r\napex.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal surface= presents centrally the five sacral spines, which\r\nare directed upward and backward, and have (with the exception of the\r\nfirst) tuberous summits which are sometimes bifid.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The first spine is relatively thin and narrow, and is not so high as\r\n  the internal angle of the ilium. The second is the longest, and the\r\n  height diminishes rapidly to the last. The bases of the spines are\r\n  often fused in old subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn either side of the spines is a groove, in which are the four =dorsal\r\nsacral foramina= (Foramina sacralia dorsalia); the dorsal branches of\r\nthe sacral nerves emerge through them.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral= or =pelvic surface= (Facies pelvina) is concave in its\r\nlength, wide in front, narrow behind. It is marked by four more or less\r\ndistinct =transverse lines= (Linæ transversæ), which indicate the\r\ndemarcation of the bodies of the vertebræ. At the ends of these lines\r\nare the =ventral sacral foramina= (Foramina sacralia ventralia), which\r\nare larger than the dorsal series and diminish in size from first to\r\nlast; they transmit the ventral divisions of the sacral nerves.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal and ventral foramina communicate with the sacral canal and\r\nare together equivalent to the usual intervertebral foramina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 19.—SACRUM OF HORSE, DORSO-LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _C_, Body of first sacral vertebra; _A_, arch of first vertebra; _Cs_,\r\n    sacral canal; _P.s._ 1–5, sacral spines; _P.t._, wings of sacrum; 1,\r\n    1′, surfaces for articulation with transverse processes of last\r\n    lumbar vertebra; _F.a._, auricular surface; 2, 2′, articular\r\n    processes; 3–6, dorsal sacral foramina; 7, interarcuate space; 8,\r\n    lateral border; _h_, apex. (Struska, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lateral borders= are rough, thick in front, thin behind.\r\n\r\nThe =base= (Basis ossis sacri) is directed forward, and is relatively\r\nvery wide. It presents centrally the =body= of the first sacral segment,\r\nwhich is wide transversely, flattened dorso-ventrally, and has a rounded\r\nsurface which articulates with the last lumbar vertebra through the\r\nmedium of an intervertebral fibro-cartilage. The ventral margin projects\r\nslightly, forming the =promontory= (Promontorium). Above the body is the\r\nentrance to the sacral canal, flanked by a pair of =articular\r\nprocesses=, which project upward and forward from the arch, and have\r\nconcave surfaces internally for articulation with those of the last\r\nlumbar vertebra. On each side of these is a smooth notch which is\r\nconverted into a foramen by apposition with the last lumbar. The lateral\r\nparts of the base, the =wings= or =alæ= (Alæ sacrales), are strong\r\nprismatic masses with pointed ends, which result from the fusion of the\r\nfirst with part of the second transverse process. Each has in front a\r\nlarge, oval, slightly convex surface for articulation with the\r\ntransverse process of the last lumbar. Posteriorly there is an elongated\r\noval area which faces upward, backward, and outward. This is the\r\n=auricular surface= (Facies auricularis), which articulates with the\r\nilium; it is slightly concave in its length, and somewhat rough and\r\nirregular. The rest of the dorsal surface of the wing is roughened for\r\nligamentous attachment, while the ventral surface is smooth.\r\n\r\nThe =apex= (Apex ossis sacri) is the posterior aspect of the last sacral\r\nvertebra and is quite small. It presents the elliptical flattened\r\nsurface of the body, above which is the triangular posterior opening of\r\nthe sacral canal, surmounted by the last sacral spine. There is a pair\r\nof narrow notches between the arch and body, above which rudiments of\r\narticular processes may occur.\r\n\r\nThe name =sacral canal= (Canalis sacralis) is applied to that part of\r\nthe vertebral canal which traverses the sacrum. Its anterior part is\r\nlarge and has the form of a triangle with the angles rounded off; its\r\nwidth is about twice its height. Traced backward it is seen to diminish\r\nin size rapidly, and the posterior opening is quite small and\r\ntriangular.\r\n\r\nThe term =lateral part= (Pars lateralis) designates the portion external\r\nto the foramina, which results from the fusion of the transverse\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 20.—FIRST COCCYGEAL VERTEBRA OF HORSE, LEFT VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 21.—FIRST COCCYGEAL VERTEBRA OF HORSE, DORSAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The several sacral vertebræ ossify in the typical manner.\r\nSeparate centers for costal elements in the lateral parts have not yet\r\nbeen found in the domesticated animals. Fusion begins in front, and is\r\nusually not complete behind till near adult age. The lateral parts unite\r\nbefore the bodies. It is rather curious that the epiphyseal plates of\r\nadjacent segments unite with each other before they fuse with the main\r\nportion of the bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COCCYGEAL VERTEBRÆ\r\n\r\nThese (Vertebræ coccygeæ) vary considerably in number, but eighteen may\r\nbe taken as an average. From first to last they become reduced in size\r\nand, with the exception of a few at the beginning of the series, consist\r\nof bodies only. The first three have bodies which are somewhat flattened\r\ndorso-ventrally, constricted in the middle, and have at the ends\r\nslightly convex, elliptical, articular surfaces. The ventral surface has\r\na median groove for the coccygeal artery. The arch is small and\r\ntriangular; it is formed of two flat plates which are prolonged to form\r\na short spinous process with a thickened and often double summit. The\r\nanterior notches are absent. Functional articular processes are not\r\npresent, but small rudiments of the anterior pair commonly occur. The\r\ntransverse processes are relatively large plates which project\r\nhorizontally outward. Further back the arch becomes incomplete, open\r\nabove, and soon disappears; the transverse processes gradually fade out,\r\nand the vertebræ are reduced to cylindrical rods of diminishing size.\r\nThe last one has a pointed end.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Variations.=—The number is said by good observers to vary between\r\n  fourteen and twenty-one. In old age the first is often fused with the\r\n  sacrum, and sometimes with the second. The arch of the third may be\r\n  open.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\nIn the mid-dorsal line is the series of =spinous processes=, which are\r\nlow ridges in the cervical region with the exception of the second and\r\nseventh, reach their maximum height at the fourth and fifth thoracic\r\nvertebræ, and diminish to the fifteenth or sixteenth thoracic. Behind\r\nthis they are about equal in height as far as the last lumbar and first\r\nsacral, which are somewhat lower. The second sacral spine is about as\r\nhigh as the middle lumbar; behind this they diminish rather rapidly in\r\nheight and fade out about the third coccygeal. Their =inclination=\r\nbackward is most decided at the second thoracic, diminishes from the\r\nsixth or seventh to the fifteenth or sixteenth, which is vertical and is\r\ntermed the =anticlinal= or =diaphragmatic vertebra.= Behind this they\r\nare inclined a little forward until the sacrum is reached; here there is\r\nan abrupt change to the backward inclination, so that a considerable\r\ninterspinous angle is formed.\r\n\r\nOn either side of the spinous processes is a =vertebral groove= which\r\ncontains the deep muscles of the spine. The floor of the groove is\r\nformed by the laminæ and articular processes. It is wide in the neck and\r\nnarrows progressively in the back.\r\n\r\nViewed from the side, the column presents a series of curves. When the\r\nhead and neck are in the ordinary neutral position, the anterior part of\r\nthe cervical spine forms a gentle curve, concave ventrally. The\r\nposterior cervical and first thoracic vertebræ form a more pronounced\r\ncurve in the opposite direction. At the junction of the cervical and\r\nthoracic regions there is a marked change of direction, forming a\r\nventral projection or angle. At the second thoracic vertebra a gentle\r\ncurve, concave ventrally, begins. This is continued to the lumbo-sacral\r\njunction, where there is a change of direction, and hence a promontory.\r\nThe sacrum has a variable, but never very pronounced, ventral concave\r\ncurvature, which is continued in a much accentuated form in the\r\ncoccygeal region. It may be remarked that a line through the summits of\r\nthe spines does not correspond to these curves formed by the bodies.\r\n\r\nThe =vertebral canal=, of course, corresponds in curvature to the\r\nbodies. Its =caliber= varies greatly at different points. The greatest\r\ndiameter (ca. 5 cm.) is in the atlas, where it contains the dens of the\r\naxis in addition to the spinal cord, and provision must be made for\r\nextensive movement. It is very much smaller in the axis (ca. 2.5 cm.\r\nwide, 3 cm. high). It widens considerably at the junction of the\r\ncervical and thoracic regions to accommodate the cervical enlargement of\r\nthe spinal cord. Beyond this it diminishes, and is smaller in the middle\r\nof the back than at any preceding point; this is correlated with the\r\nsmall size of the spinal cord and the very limited movement of the\r\nspine. At the middle of the lumbar region it again widens considerably\r\nto contain the lumbar enlargement of the spinal cord. The caliber\r\ndiminishes very rapidly from the second sacral segment backward, and the\r\ncanal ceases to be complete at the fourth coccygeal vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe =articular processes= are very large and wide apart in the neck,\r\ngreatly reduced and much closer together in the back, larger and\r\ninterlocking in the lumbar region.\r\n\r\nThe =transverse processes= are large and outstanding in the neck, where\r\nthey form the outer boundary of a ventral groove occupied by the longus\r\ncolli muscle. In the back they are short and stout, and are\r\ncharacterized by the facets for the tubercles of the ribs. On the first\r\nthoracic vertebra this facet is large, deeply concave, and situated\r\nalmost directly outward from the cavity for the head of the rib; traced\r\nbackward it becomes smaller and flatter, and gradually comes to lie\r\nbehind the cavity for the head of the rib, with which it is fused on the\r\nlast and often also on the next to the last thoracic vertebra. The\r\nprocesses in the lumbar region have a characteristic elongated\r\nplate-like form. In the sacral region they are fused to form the wings\r\nand lateral parts of the sacrum. In the coccygeal region they are at\r\nfirst of considerable size relatively, but undergo rapid reduction, and\r\ndisappear at the fifth or sixth vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe cavities for the heads of the ribs diminish progressively in size\r\nand depth from first to last.\r\n\r\nThe =mammillary processes= are usually distinct on the fourteenth to the\r\nseventeenth thoracic vertebræ. In front of these they blend with the\r\ntransverse, behind with the anterior articular processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The length of the vertebral column (including the intervertebral\r\n  fibro-cartilages) in a horse of medium size is about 260 to 265 cm.\r\n  (ca. 8 feet 8 inches to 8 feet 10 inches). The relative lengths of the\r\n  various regions appear to vary most in the neck and back.\r\n\r\n  The table below gives the measurements in centimeters in a trotting\r\n  stallion of medium size and in an adult Percheron stallion.

Eight are =sternal= or\r\n“true” ribs, the remainder =asternal= or “false.” Ribs from different\r\nparts of the series vary much in length, curvature, and other\r\ncharacters. We will therefore consider as a type a rib from the middle\r\nof the series first, and afterward note the chief serial differences. A\r\n=typical rib= has the following characters:\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= or =body= (Corpus costæ) is elongated, relatively very\r\nnarrow, and strongly curved; the curvature is most pronounced in the\r\ndorsal third, and the ventral part is twisted and inclined inward, so\r\nthat when a rib is laid with its outer surface on the table, the ventral\r\nend is raised. The =external surface= is convex in its length and also\r\ntransversely; its anterior part is, however, grooved longitudinally. A\r\ndistinct angle, _i. e._, a point at which the curve of the rib changes\r\nrather suddenly, as in man, can scarcely be said to exist in the horse.\r\nThe term is often applied, however, to a corresponding rough elevation\r\nwhich gives attachment to the ilio-costalis muscle; it is most distinct\r\non the fourth to the eighth inclusive. The =internal surface= is smooth,\r\nconcave in its length, and rounded from side to side; the costal groove,\r\nsituated posteriorly, is very distinct above and fades out about the\r\nmiddle. The =anterior border= is concave, the =posterior= convex.\r\n\r\nThe =vertebral extremity= (Extremitas vertebralis) consists of the head,\r\nneck, and tubercle. The =head= (Capitulum costæ) has an articular\r\nsurface (Facies articularis capituli costæ), composed of two convex\r\nfacets, anterior and posterior, separated by a groove for the attachment\r\nof the conjugal ligament. It articulates with the cavity formed by\r\nfacets on the bodies of two adjacent thoracic vertebræ and the\r\nintervertebral fibro-cartilage. The _neck_ (Collum costæ) is roughened\r\nabove and in front. The =tubercle= (Tuberculum costæ) is placed above\r\nand behind the junction of neck and shaft; it has a small surface\r\n(Facies articularis tuberculi costæ) for articulation with the\r\ntransverse process of the corresponding thoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe =sternal extremity= (Extremitas sternalis) is somewhat expanded, and\r\nis continued by the costal cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =first rib= is easily distinguished. It is the shortest and least\r\ncurved. At the lower part of the anterior border there is a smooth\r\nimpression where the brachial vein curves around it; above this is\r\nusually the scalene tubercle. The costal groove is absent. The head is\r\nlarge and has two facets of unequal extent which meet at an acute angle\r\nin front; the smaller one faces forward and articulates with the last\r\ncervical vertebra; the larger one is directed inward and articulates\r\nwith the first thoracic vertebra. The neck is thick and very short. The\r\ntubercle is larger than that of any other rib and has an extensive\r\narticular surface which is convex in its length. The sternal end is\r\nlarger than that of any other rib; it is thick and very wide, and is\r\nturned a little forward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.—LEFT SEVENTH RIB OF HORSE, ANTERO-EXTERNAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =last rib= is the most slender and regularly curved. It is usually\r\nbut little longer than the second. The facet on the tubercle is\r\nconfluent with that of the head. (This feature, however, is usual on the\r\nseventeenth also, and not rare on the sixteenth.)\r\n\r\nThe serial position of the other ribs may be determined approximately by\r\nthe following considerations: The =length= increases from the first to\r\nthe tenth and eleventh and then diminishes. The =width= increases\r\nsomewhat to the sixth and then diminishes. The =anterior border= is thin\r\nand sharp from the second to the eighth, and behind this becomes thick\r\nand rounded. The =external groove= is distinct on the fourth to the\r\neighth inclusive. The =curvature= increases in degree rapidly from the\r\nfirst to the seventh, remains about the same to the sixteenth, and then\r\ndecreases very noticeably. In regard to dorso-ventral =direction=, the\r\nfirst rib inclines a little forward, the second is about vertical, while\r\nbehind this they slope backward in increasing degree, so that a plane\r\ntangent to the ventral ends of the last pair cuts the third lumbar\r\nvertebra. The =head= and =tubercle= diminish in size from first to last.\r\nTheir relative positions change in that the tubercle of the first rib\r\nlies almost directly outward from the head, while further back it\r\ngradually comes to lie behind it. The =neck= is longest on the longest\r\nribs, and is absent on the last two or three. A costo-transverse foramen\r\nis formed between the neck and the transverse process.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The ribs ossify in cartilage from =three centers=, one\r\neach for the shaft, head, and tubercle; the third center is absent in\r\nsome of the posterior ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Variations.=—A nineteenth rib on one side or both is not rare. It is\r\n  usually imperfectly developed and quite variable. In some cases it is\r\n  a mere strip of cartilage connected by ligament with the first lumbar\r\n  transverse process; in other cases it is ossified, and may be fused\r\n  with the process; in others again it is connected with an additional\r\n  presacral vertebra which may be thoracic or lumbar or ambiguous in\r\n  character. It is commonly floating, but may be attached to the\r\n  eighteenth. Reduction in number is uncommon. Fusion of adjacent ribs\r\n  sometimes occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE COSTAL CARTILAGES\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.—STERNUM AND COSTAL CARTILAGES OF HORSE, VENTRAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. f. Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first costal cartilage is an inch or more (2.5 to 3 cm.) in length.\r\nThe upper part is very wide and thick. The sternal end is small. The two\r\narticulate with each other as well as with the sternum. The cartilages\r\nof the other sternal ribs increase progressively in length and become\r\nmore rounded. The sternal end is expanded and has an elliptical convex\r\nfacet for articulation with the sternum. The cartilages of the asternal\r\nribs are long, slender, and pointed. The ninth is the longest, and is\r\nvery firmly attached to the eighth; behind this they diminish\r\nprogressively in size, and are attached to each other by elastic tissue.\r\nExcept in the case of the first, the cartilage does not continue the\r\ndirection of the rib, but forms with the latter an angle which is open\r\nin front, and decreases in obtuseness from second to last.\r\n\r\nMore or less extensive ossification is to be regarded as a normal\r\noccurrence, especially in the cartilages of the sternal ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE STERNUM\r\n\r\nThe sternum of the horse is shaped somewhat like a canoe; it is\r\ncompressed laterally, except in its posterior part, which is flattened\r\ndorso-ventrally. It is inclined obliquely so that the posterior end is\r\nabout six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm.) lower than the anterior.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal surface= has the form of a very narrow isosceles triangle\r\nwith the apex in front. It is concave longitudinally, flattened\r\ntransversely.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral surfaces= are convex above, slightly concave below, and\r\ndiminish in extent behind. Each presents on its upper part seven\r\n=articular cavities= (Foveæ costales), which receive the sternal ends of\r\nthe second to the eighth costal cartilages inclusive. These cavities are\r\nsituated in series at the intersternebral junctions. The first four are\r\nelliptical in outline with the long diameter vertical, and are separated\r\nby considerable regular intervals. The others are progressively smaller,\r\nmore circular, and closer together. The area below these cavities gives\r\nattachment to the pectoral muscles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 24.—STERNUM OF HORSE, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The sternebræ are designated by Roman numerals and the costal facets\r\n    by ordinary figures.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =dorso-lateral= borders separate the dorsal and lateral surfaces.\r\nThey give attachment to the lateral branches of the sternal ligament.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral border= forms the prominent keel-like crest of the sternum\r\n(Crista sterni) which may be felt in the living animal; it fades out\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 25.—ANTERIOR APERTURE OF THORAX OF HORSE. (After Schmaltz, Atlas\r\n    d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =anterior extremity= or =manubrium sterni=[5] can be distinctly felt\r\nin the central furrow of the breast. It consists of a laterally\r\ncompressed cartilaginous prolongation, commonly called the =cariniform\r\ncartilage=. Its lateral surfaces are flat and furnish attachment to\r\nmuscles of the breast and neck. The ventral border is rounded, and is\r\ncontinued backward on the body of the bone. The dorsal border is concave\r\nand has an articular cavity for the first pair of costal cartilages.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior extremity= is formed by the =xiphoid= or =ensiform\r\ncartilage= (Processus xiphoideus). This is a thin plate, connected in\r\nfront with the last bony segment by a relatively thick, narrow neck, and\r\nexpanding in nearly circular form behind and laterally. Its dorsal\r\nsurface is concave, and gives attachment to the diaphragm. The ventral\r\nsurface is convex. The free margin is very thin.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—At birth the sternum of the horse consists of seven bony\r\nsegments or sternebræ united by intersternebral cartilages. The last two\r\nsternebræ fuse in the second month, but the others do not usually unite\r\ncompletely even in old age. The sternebræ consist of very vascular\r\nspongy bone covered by a very thin layer of compact substance. The adult\r\nsternum thus consists to a very considerable extent of persisting\r\ncartilage, viz., the intersternebral cartilages, the ventral keel, and\r\nthe extremities; in old age these undergo partial ossification.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE THORAX\r\n\r\nThe bony thorax of the horse is remarkably compressed laterally in its\r\nanterior part, but widens greatly behind. The =anterior aperture= is\r\noval and very narrow below; in a horse of medium size its greatest width\r\nis about 4 inches (10 cm.), and its height 7 to 8 inches (ca. 18 to 20\r\ncm.). The =ventral wall= or =floor= is about 10 inches (40 cm.) long,\r\nand the =dorsal wall= or =roof= about 38 to 40 inches (95 to 100 cm.)\r\nlong. The height from the last segment of the sternum to the seventh or\r\neighth thoracic vertebra is about twice that of the anterior aperture;\r\nthis is due to the obliquity and divergence of the roof and floor. The\r\ngreatest width of the posterior aperture is about 20 to 24 inches (50 to\r\n60 cm.). The intercostal spaces increase in width from the first to the\r\nseventh or eighth, and then diminish. Their average width is about 1¼ to\r\n1½ inches (3 to 3.5 cm.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE BONES OF THE SKULL\r\n\r\n\r\n                        (A) BONES OF THE CRANIUM\r\n\r\nThe bones of the cranium (Ossa cranii) are the Occipital, Sphenoid,\r\nEthmoid, Interparietal, Parietal, Frontal, and Temporal. The first four\r\nare single, the others paired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26.—SKULL, ATLAS, AND AXIS OF HORSE, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  8, Body of mandible; 28′, horizontal (molar) part of ramus; 30,\r\n    vertical part of ramus; 9, zygomatic process of squamous temporal;\r\n    11, coronoid process of mandible; 12, supraorbital process; 13″,\r\n    paramastoid (styloid) process of occipital; 19, orbit; 20, malar\r\n    bone; 21, lacrimal bone; 22, nasal bone; 23, premaxilla; 23′, nasal\r\n    process of premaxilla; 25, 29, canine teeth; 26, maxilla; 27, facial\r\n    crest; 31, condyle of mandible; 32, atlas; 33, axis; x, wing of\r\n    atlas; e, naso-maxillary notch.

The foramen is bounded laterally and\r\ndorsally by the =lateral parts= of the bone, and ventrally by the\r\n=basilar part= or =process=. Above the lateral parts—but not entering\r\ninto the formation of the foramen magnum—is the =squamous part=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 27.—LINE DRAWING OF POSTERIOR HALF OF BASE OF SKULL OF HORSE,\r\n    WITHOUT MANDIBLE.

The condyles are\r\nobliquely placed, wide apart dorsally, and separated by a small interval\r\nventrally. The articular surface is curved so sharply in the\r\ndorso-ventral direction as to form a blunt ridge externally. The cranial\r\nsurface is concave and smooth. External to the condyle is the\r\n=paramastoid= or =styloid process= (Processus jugularis), a strong\r\nflattened bar of bone which projects downward and backward; its external\r\nsurface is convex and roughened for muscular attachment. Between the\r\nroot of this process and the condyle is a smooth depression, the\r\n=condyloid fossa= (Fossa condyloidea inferior); in this is the\r\n=hypoglossal foramen= (Foramen hypoglossi), which transmits the nerve of\r\nlike name.\r\n\r\nThe =basilar part= or =process= (Pars basilaris) is a strong, somewhat\r\nprismatic bar which extends forward from the ventral margin of the\r\nforamen magnum. It is much narrower in front than behind. The ventral\r\nsurface is rounded. The cranial surface is concave and smooth; its\r\nposterior part, supports the medulla, and its anterior part has a\r\nshallow cavity on which the pons rests. The lateral borders are thin and\r\nsharp, and form the inner margin of the =foramen lacerum= (Foramen\r\nlacerum et jugulare). The anterior end has, in the young subject, a\r\nsemicircular, flat, pitted surface which is attached to the body of the\r\nsphenoid bone by a layer of cartilage; in the adult there is complete\r\nfusion. On the ventral aspect of the junction are tubercles for the\r\nattachment of the ventral straight muscles of the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 28.—VENTRAL SURFACE OF SKULL OF HORSE, POSTERIOR HALF WITHOUT\r\n    MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\n  The skull is inclined slightly. (Notation on key Fig. 27.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =squamous part= (Squama occipitalis) is the somewhat quadrilateral\r\nmass situated above the lateral portions, from which it remains distinct\r\ntill the second year. The =outer surface= is crossed by a very prominent\r\nridge, the =occipital crest=; the middle part of this is thick,\r\ntransverse in direction, and forms the highest point of the skull when\r\nthe head is in the ordinary position; laterally it becomes thinner and\r\nruns downward and forward to join the temporal crest.[7] The crest\r\ndivides the surface into two very unequal parts; the small anterior area\r\n(Planum parietale) presents a median ridge which is the posterior part\r\nof the external sagittal crest; the large area below the crest (Planum\r\nnuchale) also has a central eminence, the =external occipital\r\nprotuberance=, on the sides of which the funicular part of the\r\nligamentum nuchæ is attached. The =internal surface= is concave and\r\npresents a deep central depression and two shallower lateral ones which\r\nadapt it to the surface of the cerebellum.\r\n\r\nThe occipital bone is connected by suture with the interparietal, two\r\nparietals, and two temporals, and by synchondrosis with the sphenoid;\r\nthe condyles articulate with the atlas.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The occipital ossifies in cartilage from =four centers=,\r\nand consists at birth of four pieces as described above.[8] The lateral\r\nparts unite with the basilar at three to four months, and with the\r\nsquama in the second year, when the bone is consolidated.\r\n\r\nThe parieto-occipital suture and the spheno-occipital synchondrosis are\r\nobliterated about the fifth year usually. The temporo-occipital suture\r\npartially ossifies in old subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SPHENOID BONE\r\n\r\nThe =sphenoid bone= (Os sphenoidale) is situated in the base of the\r\ncranium, its central part lying in front of the basilar part of the\r\noccipital. It consists of a central part, the body, two pairs of wings,\r\nand two pterygoid processes.\r\n\r\nThe =body= (Corpus) is a cylindrical bar, flattened dorso-ventrally, and\r\nwider in front than behind. Its =ventral surface= (Facies externa) is\r\nconvex in the transverse direction; and its anterior part is concealed\r\nto a large extent by the vomer and pterygoid bones. The =cerebral\r\nsurface= (Facies cerebralis) presents the following features: (1) In\r\nfront is a raised, flattened part which is subdivided by a median\r\nelevation into two slightly concave lateral areas; this part has a\r\nposterior, thin, free margin (Limbus sphenoidalis), which overlies the\r\nentrance to the optic foramina. (2) Just behind this and at a lower\r\nlevel is a smooth transverse depression, the =optic groove= (Sulcus\r\nchiasmatis), on which the optic chiasma rests. (3) From each end of this\r\ngroove the =optic foramen= passes forward and outward to terminate in\r\nthe posterior part of the orbital fossa.[9] (4) Near the posterior end\r\nis a central depression, the =hypophyseal= or =pituitary fossa= (Fossa\r\nhypophysea), which lodges the hypophysis cerebri or pituitary body. On\r\neach side of this is an ill-defined groove for the internal carotid\r\nartery and the cavernous sinus. The =anterior end= is expanded, and is\r\nexcavated to form the =sphenoidal sinuses.= These cavities extend back\r\nas far as the optic groove, and are usually continuous in front with the\r\ncavities in the vertical parts of the palate bones; they are separated\r\nby a complete septum which is not always median.[10] The =posterior end=\r\nis flat and is joined to the basilar part of the occipital; at the line\r\nof junction there is dorsally a transverse elevation, the\r\n=spheno-occipital= crest (Crista sphenooccipitalis).\r\n\r\nThe =orbital wings= (Alæ orbitales) curve upward and somewhat outward\r\nfrom the sides of the body of the presphenoid. Their =inner= or\r\n=cerebral surfaces= are concave, and are marked by =digital impressions=\r\n(Impressiones digitatæ) for the gyri of the cerebrum. The =external\r\nsurface= is convex and is largely concealed by the overlapping temporal\r\nwing and the squamous temporal and frontal bones; a narrow part of it\r\n(Facies orbitalis) is uncovered on the inner wail of the orbital cavity\r\nat the sphenoidal notch of the frontal bone. The =dorsal border= unites\r\nwith the frontal bone at the spheno-frontal suture. The =anterior\r\nborder= joins the ethmoid at the spheno-ethmoidal suture; at its lower\r\npart it concurs with the frontal in the formation of the =ethmoidal= (or\r\ninternal orbital) =foramen=. The =posterior border= is overlapped by the\r\ntemporal wing and the squamous temporal. The =root= of the wing is\r\nperforated by the =optic foramen=. Immediately below and behind the\r\nlatter (_i. e._, beneath the root) is the =foramen lacerum orbitale= or\r\n=orbital fissure=. Below this, and separated from it usually by a thin\r\nplate, is a larger opening, the =foramen rotundum=, which is bounded\r\nexternally by the root of the pterygoid process. Behind these foramina\r\nis the =pterygoid crest= (Crista pterygoidea), which is continued\r\ndownward and forward on the pterygoid process; on its upper part may be\r\nfound the small and inconstant =trochlear= (or pathetic) =foramen=. Just\r\nbehind the crest is the =temporal foramen= (For. alare parvum), through\r\nwhich the anterior deep temporal artery emerges from the alar canal of\r\nthe pterygoid process.\r\n\r\nThe =temporal wings= (Alæ temporales) extend outward and somewhat upward\r\nfrom the body of the postsphenoid; they are irregularly quadrilateral in\r\noutline. The =external surface= (Facies temporalis) enters into the\r\nformation of the infratemporal fossa, and bears the pterygoid process on\r\nits anterior part; at the junction with the body there is a small groove\r\nfor the pterygoid nerve. The =internal surface= (Facies cerebralis)\r\npresents, at the junction with the body, two longitudinal =grooves=\r\n(Sulci nervorum). The outer groove is the larger, and leads forward to\r\nthe foramen rotundum; it contains the maxillary nerve. The inner groove\r\nconducts to the orbital fissure, and contains the third, sixth, and\r\nophthalmic nerves. The outer groove is bounded externally by a thin\r\noverhanging crest, on which is a small groove for the fourth nerve. The\r\nremainder of the surface is concave and supports the pyriform lobe of\r\nthe brain. The =dorsal border= joins the squamous temporal at the\r\nspheno-squamous suture. The =anterior border= joins the orbital wing.\r\nThe =posterior border= forms the anterior boundary of the foramen\r\nlacerum; it presents =three notches=, which are (from within outward)\r\nthe carotid, oval, and spinous (Incisura carotica, ovalis, spinosa). The\r\nangle of junction of the dorsal and posterior borders articulates with\r\nthe parietal bone.\r\n\r\nThe =pterygoid processes= (Processus pterygoidei) arise from the\r\ntemporal wings and the body. They project downward and forward, and\r\ncurve outward at the lower part. The root is perforated by the =alar\r\ncanal= (Canalis alaris),[11] which transmits the internal maxillary\r\nartery. From this canal a branch leads upward and forward to open at the\r\ntemporal foramen. The =external surface= is concave, and is marked by\r\nlines for muscular attachment. The =internal surface= is largely\r\nconcealed by the overlapping palate and pterygoid bones, with which it\r\nconcurs in the formation of the =pterygoid= or =Vidian canal=.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The sphenoid is ossified in cartilage, and consists in\r\nearly life of two distinct parts, the presphenoid and postsphenoid. The\r\nformer develops from two centers, one in each wing; the latter has three\r\ncenters, one for the body and one for each wing. The pterygoid processes\r\nossify from the centers of the temporal wings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Variation.=—The dorsal border of the orbital wing may come to the\r\n  surface through a defect in the frontal bone at the place where the\r\n  horn process is situated in animals which have frontal horns.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE ETHMOID BONE\r\n\r\nThe =ethmoid= (Os ethmoidale) is situated in front of the body and\r\norbital wings of the sphenoid. It projects forward between the orbital\r\nplates of the frontal bones and enters into the formation of the\r\ncranial, nasal, and paranasal cavities.[12] It consists of four\r\nparts—the cribriform plate, two lateral masses, and the perpendicular\r\nplate.\r\n\r\nThe =cribriform plate= (Lamina cribrosa) is a sieve-like partition\r\nbetween the cranial and nasal cavities. Its margin joins the orbital\r\nwings of the sphenoid laterally, and the cranial plate of the frontal\r\nbones dorsally. Its =cranial surface= is divided into two parts by a\r\nmedian ridge, the =crista galli=, which is the intracranial portion of\r\nthe perpendicular plate. Each half forms a deep oval cavity, the\r\n=ethmoidal= or =olfactory fossa=, which lodges the olfactory bulb. The\r\nplate is perforated by numerous small foramina for the passage of the\r\nolfactory nerve filaments, and on either side is the much larger\r\n=ethmoidal foramen.= The =nasal surface= is convex, and has the lateral\r\nmasses attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral masses= or =labyrinth= project forward from the cribriform\r\nplate into the posterior part of the nasal cavity, which they nearly\r\nfill. Each mass is somewhat conical in shape, with the base attached to\r\nhalf of the cribriform plate. The =inner surface= is separated by a\r\nnarrow space from the perpendicular plate. The =outer surface= is convex\r\nand faces chiefly into the frontal and maxillary sinuses, but is\r\nattached behind to the inner wall of the orbital cavity; it is covered\r\nby a very thin layer of bone, the =lamina papyracea.= The mass consists\r\nof a large number of delicate, scroll-like plates of bone, termed\r\n=ethmoturbinals= or =ethmoidal cells.= These are attached to the lamina\r\npapyracea, and are separated by narrow intervals termed =ethmoidal\r\nmeatuses=, which communicate with the nasal cavity. In the living animal\r\nthe ethmoturbinals are covered with mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.—CROSS-SECTION OF LATERAL MASS OF ETHMOID BONE OF HORSE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The lateral mass is a very complex structure, the arrangement of which\r\n  may be studied on cross-sections of decalcified specimens with the\r\n  mucous membrane retained. Each mass consists of six turbinals which\r\n  extend almost to the perpendicular plate and are termed\r\n  =endoturbinals=. These diminish in size from above downward; the\r\n  largest is attached to the nasal bone, and is hence usually called the\r\n  naso-turbinal or superior turbinal; the second is much smaller, and is\r\n  very commonly termed the great ethmoid cell. Between the endoturbinals\r\n  are twenty-one small =ecto=turbinals, and all are beset with secondary\r\n  and tertiary coiled lamellæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =perpendicular plate= or =mesethmoid= (Lamina perpendicularis) is\r\nmedian, and forms the posterior part of the septum nasi. Its =lateral\r\nsurfaces= are nearly plane, but are marked below by some grooves and\r\nridges; they are covered by the nasal mucous membrane. The =anterior\r\nborder= is irregular and is continuous with the septal cartilage. The\r\n=posterior border= projects into the cranial cavity as a ridge, the\r\n=crista galli.= The =dorsal border= joins the frontal bones at their\r\nline of junction—the frontal suture. The =ventral border= is received\r\ninto the groove of the vomer.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The ethmoid develops in cartilage from five centers, two\r\nfor each lateral mass, and one for the perpendicular plate; from the\r\nlatter ossification extends into the cribriform plate. At birth the\r\nperpendicular and cribriform plates are entirely cartilaginous. By the\r\ntime ossification is complete the ethmoid has united with surrounding\r\nbones to such an extent that it cannot be separated intact for study.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 30.—SKULL OF HORSE, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  12, Supraorbital process; 14, parietal bone; 14′, external sagittal\r\n    crest; 15, frontal bone; 15′, frontal crest; 21, lacrimal bone; 22,\r\n    nasal bone; 26, maxilla; 24, incisor teeth. (After Ellenberger-Baum,\r\n    Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE INTERPARIETAL BONE\r\n\r\nThis bone (Os interparietale) is centrally placed between the squamous\r\npart of the occipital and the parietal bones. It is usually described as\r\na single bone, although it ossifies from two chief lateral centers, and\r\nis sometimes distinctly paired in skulls of young foals.\r\n\r\nThe =external surface= (Facies externa) is quadrilateral and is flat and\r\nsmooth in the very young foal; later it presents the median external\r\nsagittal crest.\r\n\r\nThe =internal surface= (Facies cerebralis) presents the =internal\r\noccipital protuberance=, a three-sided process which projects downward\r\nand forward into the cranial cavity between the cerebral hemispheres and\r\nthe cerebellum; it has three concave surfaces and three sharp borders\r\nwhich form part of the tentorium osseum.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior border= is thick; it joins the squamous part of the\r\noccipital bone. The =lateral= and =anterior borders= are united by\r\nsuture with the parietal bones.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The interparietal ossifies in membrane from two chief\r\nlateral centers.[13] It fuses first with the parietals, somewhat later\r\nwith the occipital, but the period at which this union takes place is\r\nquite variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PARIETAL BONES\r\n\r\nThe two =parietal bones= (Ossa parietalia) form the greater part of the\r\nroof of the cranium; they unite in the median line, forming the\r\n=sagittal suture=. Each is quadrilateral in outline and has two surfaces\r\nand four borders.\r\n\r\nThe =external surface= (Facies parietalis) is convex, and is marked by a\r\nmore or less prominent curved line, the =external sagittal crest=; this\r\nis median in its posterior part, and is continuous with the crest of\r\nlike name on the occipital bone; in front it curves outward and is\r\ncontinuous with the frontal crest. The surface external to the crest\r\n(Planum temporale) enters into the formation of the temporal fossa, and\r\nis roughened for the attachment of the temporal muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =internal= or =cerebral surface= (Facies cerebralis) is concave. It\r\npresents numerous =digital impressions= (Impressiones digitatæ) which\r\ncorrespond to the gyri of the cerebrum. There are also furrows (Sulci\r\nvasculosi) for the meningeal arteries. Along the inner border there is a\r\n=sagittal groove= (Sulcus sagittalis) for the superior longitudinal\r\nsinus.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior border= joins the frontal bone at the =parieto-frontal\r\nsuture= (Sutura coronalis).\r\n\r\nThe =posterior border= meets the occipital bone at the\r\n=parieto-occipital suture= (Sutura lambdoidea). Below this junction it\r\ncurves inward and concurs with the temporal bone in the formation of the\r\n=parieto-temporal canal= (Meatus temporalis). A =transverse groove=\r\n(Sulcus transversus) connects this canal with the sagittal sulcus.\r\n\r\nThe =internal border= is thick and serrated. It joins its fellow at the\r\n=sagittal suture=, and (in the young subject) meets the interparietal at\r\nthe =interparietal suture=. The line of junction is marked internally by\r\nthe =internal sagittal crest= (Crista sagittalis interna).\r\n\r\nThe =external border= is beveled and is overlapped by the squamous\r\ntemporal bone, forming the parieto-temporal suture (Sutura\r\nparieto-squamosa). The angle of junction of the external and posterior\r\nborders articulates with the posterior angle of the temporal wing of the\r\nsphenoid.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—Each parietal bone ossifies in membrane from a single\r\ncenter. In the young foal the central part of the bone is much more\r\nconvex than in the adult and forms a prominence similar to the\r\npronounced tuber parietale of the young child; the external sagittal\r\ncrest is not present, and the external surface is smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The sagittal suture is usually closed at four years, the\r\n  parieto-occipital at five years, and the parieto-temporal at twelve to\r\n  fifteen years.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FRONTAL BONES\r\n\r\nThe =frontal bones= (Ossa frontalia) are situated on the limits of the\r\ncranium and face, between the parietals behind and the nasal bones in\r\nfront. Each is irregularly quadrilateral, and consists of frontal,\r\norbital, and temporal parts.\r\n\r\nThe =frontal part= (Pars naso-frontalis) forms the basis of the\r\nforehead. Its =external surface= (Facies frontalis) is nearly flat, and\r\nis smooth and subcutaneous; it is separated from the temporal part by\r\nthe external frontal crest (Crista frontalis externa). At the junction\r\nwith the orbital part the =supraorbital= or =zygomatic process= (Proc.\r\nzygomaticus) curves outward and downward to join the zygomatic arch. The\r\nprocess partially separates the orbit from the temporal fossa; its root\r\nis perforated by the =supraorbital foramen=, or presents instead a notch\r\non its anterior border; its upper surface is convex, while the lower or\r\norbital surface is concave and smooth, forming a shallow fossa for the\r\nlacrimal gland (Fossa glandulæ lacrimalis). The =internal surface=\r\nenters into the formation of the cranial cavity and the frontal sinus.\r\nThe cranial surface presents digital impressions for the cerebral gyri.\r\nThe two plates of the bone separate and diverge in front, and thus\r\ninclose a large air-space which is part of the =frontal sinus=. The\r\ncranial plate curves downward and articulates with the cribriform plate\r\nof the ethmoid bone; the facial plate extends forward and joins the\r\nnasal and lacrimal bones.\r\n\r\nThe =orbital part= (Pars orbitalis) forms the major part of the inner\r\nwall of the orbital cavity. It is separated from the frontal part by a\r\nprominent ridge which is part of the orbital margin. Its =external= or\r\n=orbital surface= is concave and smooth, and presents superiorly a small\r\ndepression (Fovea trochlearis), which is bridged by a small bar of\r\ncartilage, around which the superior oblique muscle of the eye is\r\nreflected. The lower border concurs with the orbital wing of the\r\nsphenoid in the formation of the ethmoidal or internal orbital foramen.\r\nThe =internal surface= faces into the frontal sinus and gives attachment\r\nto the lateral mass of the ethmoid.\r\n\r\nThe =temporal part= is separated from the orbital part by the deep\r\n=sphenoidal notch= (Incisura sphenoidalis), which is occupied by the\r\norbital wing of the sphenoid. Its =external surface= forms part of the\r\ninner wall of the temporal fossa. The =internal surface= is largely\r\ncovered by the orbital wing of the sphenoid in the young subject, but\r\nlater forms part of the wall of the frontal sinus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The principal connections of the frontal bone are as follows: (1) The\r\n  inner border joins its fellow at the =frontal suture=. (2) The\r\n  anterior border meets the nasal and lacrimal at the =naso-frontal= and\r\n  =fronto-lacrimal sutures=. (3) Laterally it forms the =spheno-frontal=\r\n  suture with the orbital wing of the sphenoid, and also joins the\r\n  palate bone and maxilla. (4) Posteriorly it meets the parietal at the\r\n  =parieto-frontal= (or coronal) =suture=, and articulates below this\r\n  with the squamous temporal. (5) The extremity of the supraorbital\r\n  process unites with the zygomatic process of the temporal bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Development.=—Each ossifies in membrane from one center which appears\r\nin the root of the supraorbital process. In the new-born foal there is a\r\nslit between the cranial plate and the orbital and temporal plates which\r\nreceives the cartilaginous margin of the orbital wing of the sphenoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE TEMPORAL BONES\r\n\r\nThe =temporal bone= (Os temporale) forms the greater part of the lateral\r\nwall of the cranium. It is situated between the occipital behind, the\r\nparietal above, the frontal in front, and the sphenoid below. It\r\nconsists of two distinct parts, =squamous= and =petrous=.\r\n\r\n1. The =squamous temporal= (Squama temporalis) is a shell-like plate\r\nwhich has two surfaces and four borders.\r\n\r\nThe =internal surface= (Facies cerebralis) is largely overlapped by the\r\nsurrounding bones, but its central part is free and presents digital\r\nimpressions and vascular grooves.\r\n\r\nThe =external surface= (Facies temporalis) is convex, and enters into\r\nthe formation of the temporal fossa. From its lower part there springs\r\nthe =zygomatic process= (Processus zygomaticus), which forms the\r\nexternal boundary of the temporal fossa. It is at first directed\r\noutward, and is wide and flattened dorso-ventrally. It then turns\r\nforward, becomes narrower, and is twisted so that its surfaces are\r\ninternal and external. Its anterior end is pointed and joins the\r\nzygomatic process of the malar bone, with which it forms the =zygomatic\r\narch= (Arcus zygomaticus). The narrow anterior part has a convex outer\r\nsurface and a concave inner one. Its upper border has a rough area for\r\narticulation with the supraorbital process of the frontal. Its lower\r\nborder is wide and rough. The wide posterior part presents on its\r\nventral face a surface for articulation with the condyle of the\r\nmandible. This surface consists of a transversely elongated =condyle=\r\n(Tuberculum articulare), behind which is the =glenoid fossa= (Fossa\r\nmandibularis). The fossa is limited behind by the =postglenoid process=,\r\nthe anterior surface of which is articular. Behind this process is a\r\nfossa in which is the external opening of the parieto-temporal canal.\r\nThe dorsal surface is concave and forms the outer boundary of the\r\ntemporal fossa. The superior border is sinuous and is continuous behind\r\nwith the temporal crest.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior process= (Processus posterior) springs from the posterior\r\npart of the squama. Its external surface is crossed by the temporal\r\ncrest, which forms here the outer limit of the temporal fossa. The\r\ninternal surface forms the outer boundary of the parieto-temporal canal,\r\nand is elsewhere applied to the petrous portion. It divides into two\r\nbranches, upper and lower; the upper branch unites with the occipital\r\nbone, while the lower one curves downward behind the external auditory\r\nprocess and overlaps the mastoid process.\r\n\r\nThe =superior border= of the squamous temporal articulates with the\r\nparietal, forming the =parieto-temporal suture=. The =inferior border=\r\njoins the temporal wing of the sphenoid at the =spheno-squamous suture=.\r\nThe =anterior border= unites with the frontal bone, and the =posterior=\r\nwith the parietal.\r\n\r\n2. The =petrous temporal= (Os petrosum) is placed between the occipital\r\nbehind and the parietal in front, and is largely overlapped externally\r\nby the squamous temporal. It has the form of a four-sided pyramid, the\r\nbase of which is ventral.\r\n\r\nThe =external surface= is mainly concealed by the squamous temporal, but\r\ntwo features are visible. A short tube of bone, the =external auditory\r\nprocess=, protrudes from the lowest part through the notch of the\r\nsquamous temporal. The process is directed outward, upward, and a little\r\nforward. It gives attachment to the annular cartilage of the ear. Its\r\nlumen, the =external auditory meatus= (Meatus acusticus externus),\r\nconducts to the cavity of the middle ear (tympanum) in the dry skull,\r\nbut is separated from it by the tympanic membrane in the natural state.\r\nThe =mastoid process= projects ventrally in the interval between the\r\nposterior process of the squamous temporal and the root of the\r\nparamastoid (or styloid) process of the occipital bone; its outer\r\nsurface is crossed by a curved groove which leads to the\r\nparieto-temporal canal.\r\n\r\nThe =internal surface= faces into the cerebellar fossa of the cranium.\r\nIt is concave and smooth but irregular. In its lower part is the\r\nentrance to a short canal, the =internal auditory meatus=, which\r\ntransmits the seventh and eighth cranial nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fundus of the meatus is divided by a crest into a superior and an\r\n  inferior fossa. In the superior one is the origin of the =facial\r\n  canal=, which curves through the bone and opens externally at the\r\n  stylo-mastoid foramen; it transmits the facial (seventh cranial)\r\n  nerve. The inferior fossa presents small foramina for the passage of\r\n  fibers of the auditory (eighth cranial) nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind the meatus and near the posterior margin of the surface is the\r\nslit-like opening of the aquæductus vestibuli, covered by a scale of\r\nbone. Below this is a narrow fissure, the orifice of the aquæductus\r\ncochleæ.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior surface= looks upward and forward. The outer part\r\narticulates with the parietal bone and the inner part faces into the\r\ncerebral fossa of the cranium. A sharp border, the =petrosal crest=\r\n(Crista petrosa), separates this surface from the inner one.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior surface= joins the lateral part of the occipital bone.\r\n\r\nThe =base forms= the outer boundary of the foramen lacerum basis cranii.\r\nIt is very irregular and presents a number of important features. The\r\n=hyoid process= is a short rod which projects downward and forward below\r\nthe base of the external auditory process, inclosed in a bony tube; it\r\nis connected by a bar of cartilage with the hyoid bone. The\r\n=stylo-mastoid foramen= is situated between the root of the hyoid\r\nprocess and the mastoid process; it is the external opening of the\r\nfacial canal, through which the facial nerve emerges. The =bulla ossea=\r\nis a considerable eminence situated centrally; it is thin-walled and\r\nincloses a cavity which is part of the tympanum. The =muscular\r\nprocess=[14] is a sharp spine which projects downward and forward from\r\nthe anterior part of the base; it gives origin to the tensor and levator\r\npalati muscles. External to the root of the preceding is the small\r\n=petro-tympanic= or =Glaserian fissure= (Fissura petro-tympanica) for\r\nthe passage of the chorda tympani nerve. The osseous =Eustachian tube=\r\nis a semicanal at the inner side of the root of the muscular process; it\r\nleads to the tympanum. At the inner side of the preceding is the\r\nslit-like orifice of the petrosal canal, which communicates with the\r\nfacial canal.\r\n\r\nThe =apex= projects upward and backward between the squamous temporal\r\nand the occipital bone.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The petrous temporal may be regarded as consisting of\r\npetro-mastoid and tympanic parts. The latter includes the external\r\nauditory process, the bulla ossea, and the muscular process; it is\r\ndeveloped in membrane. The petro-mastoid is developed in the\r\ncartilaginous ear capsule. Its petrous part consists of very dense bone\r\nwhich contains the labyrinth or internal ear and forms the inner wall of\r\nthe tympanum.\r\n\r\nThe =parieto-temporal canal= (Meatus temporalis) is a continuation of\r\nthe transverse groove which extends outward from the base of the\r\ntentorium osseum. It is directed downward, forward, and somewhat\r\noutward, and opens externally in front of the root of the auditory\r\nprocess. It is bounded by the squamous temporal externally, the petrous\r\nbehind, and the parietal in front and internally. Several foramina open\r\nfrom it into the temporal fossa. It contains a large vein (Vena\r\ncerebralis dorsalis), the continuation of the transverse sinus of the\r\ndura mater.\r\n\r\nThe =foramen lacerum basis cranii= (Foramen lacerum et jugulare) is a\r\nlarge irregular opening in the cranial base, bounded internally by the\r\nbasilar part of the occipital bone, externally by the petrous temporal,\r\nand in front by the temporal wing of the sphenoid. It consists of a\r\nlarge anterior part (Foramen lacerum anterius), and a narrow posterior\r\npart (Foramen lacerum posterius s. jugulare). It transmits the internal\r\ncarotid artery, the middle meningeal artery, the mandibular, ninth,\r\ntenth, and eleventh cranial nerves, and the inferior cerebral vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the fresh state the foramen is occupied by a dense fibrous membrane\r\n  which is perforated by apertures for the various structures\r\n  transmitted. Thus there are three openings in front for the internal\r\n  carotid artery, the mandibular nerve, and the middle meningeal artery;\r\n  these are (from within outward) the foramen caroticum, ovale,\r\n  spinosum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         (B) BONES OF THE FACE\r\n\r\nThe bones of the face (Ossa faciei) are the Maxilla, Premaxilla,\r\nPalatine, Pterygoid, Nasal, Lacrimal, Malar, Superior Turbinal, Inferior\r\nTurbinal, Vomer, Mandible, and Hyoid. The last three are single, the\r\nothers paired.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MAXILLAE\r\n\r\nThe =maxillæ= are the principal bones of the upper jaw and carry the\r\nupper cheek teeth. They are situated on the lateral aspect of the face,\r\nand articulate with almost all of the facial bones and the frontal and\r\ntemporal also. For description each may be divided into a body and two\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nThe =body= (Corpus maxillæ) presents two surfaces, two borders, and two\r\nextremities. The =external= or =facial surface= (Facies lateralis) is\r\nsomewhat concave in front and convex behind. On its posterior part is a\r\nhorizontal ridge, the =facial= or =zygomatic crest= (Crista facialis);\r\nin a skull of medium size its anterior end is about an inch and a half\r\n(3 to 4 cm.) above the third or fourth cheek tooth, and it is continued\r\nbehind by a corresponding ridge on the malar bone. About two inches (5\r\ncm.) above and a little in front of the anterior end of the crest is the\r\n=infraorbital foramen= (Foramen infraorbitale); this is the external\r\nopening of the infraorbital canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the young horse the anterior part of the surface is convex over the\r\n  embedded parts of the teeth. As the latter are extruded the surface\r\n  flattens and becomes concave in old subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =internal= or =nasal surface= (Facies nasalis) is concave\r\ndorso-ventrally; it forms the greater part of the lateral wall of the\r\nnasal cavity. Its upper part is crossed obliquely forward and downward\r\nby the shallow =lacrimal groove= (Sulcus lacrimalis), which contains the\r\nnaso-lacrimal duct; in the adult the posterior part of the groove is\r\nconverted into a canal, which is continuous with that on the inner\r\nsurface of the lacrimal bone. Below the groove is the =inferior turbinal\r\ncrest= (Crista conchalis inferior), to which the inferior turbinal bone\r\nis attached. Lower down and parallel with the turbinal crest is the\r\n=palatine process=, which projects inward like a shelf. Behind this the\r\nsurface is rough for articulation with the palate bone; this area is\r\ncrossed by a groove which concurs with a furrow on the palate bone in\r\nthe formation of the =palatine canal=. The posterior part of the bone is\r\nexcavated to form part of the maxillary sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =superior border= is irregular and scaly. Its anterior part is\r\ngrooved and its posterior part beveled for articulation with the nasal\r\nprocess of the premaxilla and the nasal and lacrimal bones.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior= or =alveolar border= (Processus alveolaris) is thick, and\r\npresents six large cavities, the =alveoli=, for the cheek teeth. The\r\nalveoli are separated by transverse =interalveolar septa=. There is\r\noften a small alveolus for the first premolar (“wolf tooth”) close to\r\nthe first large one. Further forward the border is narrow and forms part\r\nof the =interdental= or =interalveolar space= (Margo interalveolaris).\r\nBehind the last alveolus is a rough area, the =alveolar tuberosity=.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior extremity= is pointed. It joins the premaxilla, and forms\r\nwith it the alveolus for the canine tooth.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior extremity= forms a rounded prominence, the =maxillary\r\ntuberosity= (Tuber maxillare). Internal to the tuberosity is a deep\r\ncavity, the maxillary hiatus, in which are three foramina. The upper\r\none, the =maxillary foramen=, leads into the infraorbital canal. The\r\nlower one, the =posterior palatine foramen=, is the entrance to the\r\npalatine canal. The =sphenopalatine foramen= perforates the inner wall\r\nof the hiatus and opens into the nasal cavity.\r\n\r\nThe =zygomatic= or =temporal process= (Processus temporalis) projects\r\nbackward above and external to the tuberosity; it is overlapped by the\r\ncorresponding part of the malar and also articulates with the zygomatic\r\nprocess of the temporal. A small curved plate extends inward from it and\r\njoins the frontal and palate bones, forming part of the floor of the\r\norbit.\r\n\r\nThe =palatine process= (Processus palatinus) is a plate which projects\r\nhorizontally inward from the lower part of the inner surface of the\r\nbody. It forms the greater part of the basis of the hard palate. Its\r\n=superior= or =nasal surface= is smooth and concave transversely; on its\r\nanterior part, close to the inner border, is a shallow groove in which\r\nthe organ of Jacobson is situated. The inferior or =palatine surface= is\r\nslightly concave from side to side, and presents along its outer part\r\nthe =palatine groove= (Sulcus palatinus). The groove is a continuation\r\nof the palatine canal, and contains the palatine artery and nerve. The\r\n=internal border= unites with its fellow to form the median palatine\r\nsuture; its nasal aspect bears the nasal crest, which forms, with that\r\nof the opposite process, a groove for the vomer. The =posterior border=\r\nunites with the horizontal part of the palate bone at the transverse\r\npalatine suture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 31.—UPPER JAW OF HORSE ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF YEARS OLD, VENTRAL\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  1, 1, Posterior nares; 2, vomer; 3, horizontal part of palate bone; 4,\r\n    anterior palatine foramen; 5, palatine groove; 6, transverse\r\n    palatine suture; 7, median palatine suture; 8, palate process of\r\n    maxilla; 9, palate process of premaxilla; 10, foramen incisivum; 11,\r\n    malar bone; 12, maxilla; 13, anterior end of facial crest; 14,\r\n    interalveolar space; I. 1–3, incisor teeth; _C_, canine tooth; _P1_,\r\n    first premolar or “wolf” tooth.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =infraorbital= or =superior dental canal= extends almost\r\nhorizontally from the maxillary foramen to the infraorbital foramen. It\r\nis placed at the upper edge of the inner plate of the maxilla, and\r\ntraverses the maxillary sinus. Near the infraorbital foramen it gives\r\noff a small canal (Canalis alveolaris incisivus) which lies above the\r\nroots of the premolars and extends also into the premaxilla, carrying\r\nvessels and nerves to the teeth there.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The maxilla ossifies in membrane below and external to\r\nthe cartilaginous nasal capsule. It has one chief center and a\r\nsupplementary one in the region of the deciduous canine tooth (Martin).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE PREMAXILLAE\r\n\r\nThe =premaxillæ= (Ossa incisiva) form the anterior part of the upper jaw\r\nand carry the incisor teeth. Each consists of a body and two processes,\r\nnasal and palatine.\r\n\r\nThe =body= is the thick anterior part which carries the incisor teeth.\r\nIts =labial= or =superior= surface is convex and smooth, and is related\r\nto the upper lip. The =palatine= or =inferior surface= is concave and\r\npresents a foramen a little behind its middle.[15] The =internal\r\nsurface= is rough, and joins the opposite bone; it is marked by a curved\r\ngroove, which forms with that on the opposed surface, the incisive\r\n=foramen= (Foramen incisivum). The =alveolar border= (Limbus alveolaris)\r\nseparates the palatine and labial surfaces; it is curved and thick, and\r\npresents three alveoli for the incisor teeth; behind the third alveolus\r\nit is rounded and free, forming part of the =interalveolar space=.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal process= (Processus nasalis) projects backward and upward\r\nfrom the body, forming here the lateral wall of the nasal cavity. The\r\ntwo =surfaces=, =facial= and =nasal=, are smooth and rounded. The\r\n=superior border= is free, thick, and smooth. The =inferior border= is\r\ndentated and joins the maxilla; at its anterior end it forms with the\r\nlatter the alveolus for the permanent canine tooth.[16] The =posterior\r\nextremity= fits into the interval between the nasal bone and the\r\nmaxilla.\r\n\r\nThe =palatine process= (Processus palatinus) is a thin plate which forms\r\nthe anterior part of the basis of the hard palate. Its =nasal= or\r\n=superior surface= has a longitudinal ridge which forms with that of the\r\nother side a groove for the septal cartilage. The =palatine= or\r\n=inferior surface= is flat. The =internal border= is serrated and meets\r\nits fellow at the median palatine suture. The =external border= is\r\nseparated from the maxilla and the nasal process by the =palatine cleft=\r\n(Fissura palatina). The =posterior extremity= fits into the interval\r\nbetween the vomer and the palatine process of the maxilla.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The premaxilla ossifies from a single center. Fusion of\r\nthe two bones is complete at the end of the third or the beginning of\r\nthe fourth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PALATINE BONES\r\n\r\nThe =palatine bones= (Ossa palatina) are situated on either side of the\r\nposterior nares, and form the posterior margin of the hard palate. Each\r\nis twisted so as to form a horizontal and a perpendicular part.\r\n\r\nThe =horizontal part= (Pars horizontalis) is a narrow plate which forms\r\nthe posterior part of the hard palate. It presents smooth =nasal= and\r\n=palatine surfaces=. The =internal border= meets its fellow at the\r\nmedian palatine suture, on the nasal aspect of which is the nasal crest.\r\nThe =anterior border= joins the palate process of the maxilla at the\r\ntransverse palatine suture, and forms with it the anterior palatine\r\nforamen. The =posterior border= is concave and free; it gives attachment\r\nto the aponeurosis of the soft palate.\r\n\r\nThe =perpendicular part= (Pars perpendicularis) is more extensive and\r\nforms the outer boundary of the posterior nares. The =nasal= or\r\n=internal surface= is in the greater part of its extent concave and\r\nsmooth; it is marked by a narrow rough area to which the pterygoid bone\r\nis attached. Below this the bone curves outward, forming the pterygoid\r\nprocess. The =maxillary= or =external surface= (Facies maxillaris)\r\npresents three areas for consideration. The largest articulates with the\r\nmaxilla; it is rough and is crossed by a groove which enters into the\r\nformation of the palatine canal. Behind this is a smooth part which\r\nassists in forming the =pterygo-palatine fossa=. The rough area below\r\nthis is overlapped by the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. The\r\n=superior border= is perforated by the =sphenopalatine foramen=. Behind\r\nthe foramen the two plates of the bone separate to inclose part of the\r\n=sphenopalatine sinus=. The inner plate curves inward to articulate with\r\nthe vomer. The outer plate joins the maxilla and frontal and the orbital\r\nwing of the sphenoid.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The palatine bone ossifies in membrane from a single\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE PTERYGOID BONES\r\n\r\nThe =pterygoid bones= (Ossa pterygoidea) are narrow, thin, bent plates,\r\nsituated on either side of the posterior nares. Each has two surfaces\r\nand two extremities. The =internal surface= is smooth, and forms part of\r\nthe boundary of the posterior nares. The =external surface= articulates\r\nwith the palatine, vomer, and sphenoid, concurring with the last in the\r\nformation of the =pterygoid= or =Vidian canal=. The =anterior extremity=\r\nis free, turned slightly outward, and forms the =hamulus=, a pulley\r\naround which the tendon of the tensor palati muscle is reflected.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The pterygoid ossifies in membrane from a single center.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE NASAL BONES\r\n\r\nThe =nasal bones= (Ossa nasalia) are situated in front of the frontal\r\nbones and form the greater part of the roof of the nasal cavity. They\r\nhave an elongated triangular outline, wide behind, pointed in front.\r\nEach presents two surfaces, two borders, a base, and an apex.\r\n\r\nThe =external= or =facial surface= is smooth and is convex transversely;\r\nthe profile contour is usually slightly wavy, with a depression about\r\nits middle and a variably prominent area in front.\r\n\r\nThe =internal= or =nasal surface= is smooth and concave from side to\r\nside. About in its middle it presents the =superior turbinal crest=\r\n(Crista conchalis dorsalis), which is parallel with the inner border,\r\nand has the superior turbinal bone attached to it. Most of this surface\r\nfaces into the nasal cavity, but its posterior part enters into the\r\nformation of the frontal sinus; the latter area is marked off by an\r\noblique ridge.\r\n\r\nThe =internal border= is straight, and meets the opposite bone at the\r\n=nasal suture=.\r\n\r\nThe =external border= is irregular. Its anterior third is free and\r\nconcurs with the nasal process in forming the =naso-maxillary notch=\r\n(Incisura naso-maxillaris). Behind this it is scaly for articulation\r\nwith the end of the nasal process, the maxilla, and the lacrimal,\r\nforming the =naso-maxillary= and =naso-lacrimal sutures=.\r\n\r\nThe =base= or posterior end is beveled and overlaps the frontal bone,\r\nforming the =naso-frontal suture=.\r\n\r\nThe =apex= is pointed and thin.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—Each nasal bone ossifies in membrane from a single\r\ncenter. The nasal suture does not close completely even in old age. In\r\nsome cases the two plates separate to inclose a small air-space in the\r\nposterior part.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE LACRIMAL BONES\r\n\r\nThe =lacrimal bones= (Ossa lacrimalia) are situated at the anterior part\r\nof the orbit, and extend forward on the face to the posterior border of\r\nthe maxilla. Each presents three surfaces and a circumference.\r\n\r\nThe external aspect is clearly divided into orbital and facial parts by\r\nthe orbital margin. The =orbital surface= (Facies orbitalis) is\r\ntriangular in outline, smooth and concave; it forms part of the inner\r\nand front wall of the orbit. Near the orbital margin it presents a\r\nfunnel-like =fossa= for the lacrimal sac (Fossa sacci lacrimalis), which\r\nis the entrance to the osseous lacrimal canal. Behind this is a\r\ndepression in which the inferior oblique muscle of the eye takes origin.\r\nThe =facial surface= (Facies facialis) is more extensive, and has the\r\nform of an irregular pentagon. It is slightly convex and smooth in the\r\nfoal, flattened in the adult. It usually bears the small =lacrimal\r\ntubercle=, situated nearly an inch (ca. 2 cm.) from the orbital margin.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal= or =internal surface= (Facies nasalis) faces into the\r\nfrontal and maxillary sinuses. It is concave and very irregular, and is\r\ncrossed almost horizontally by the =osseous lacrimal canal= (Canalis\r\nlacrimalis osseus).\r\n\r\nThe =orbital margin= (Margo orbitalis) is concave, rough above, smooth\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe =circumference= articulates above with the frontal and nasal bones,\r\nbelow with the malar and maxilla, in front with the maxilla, and behind\r\nwith the frontal. The various sutures so formed are designated by\r\ncombinations of the names of the bones.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—Each ossifies in membrane from a single center.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MALAR BONES\r\n\r\nThe =malar= or =zygomatic bones= (Ossa zygomatica) are placed between\r\nthe lacrimal above and the maxilla below and in front. Each is\r\nirregularly triangular in outline and presents three surfaces, three\r\nborders, a base, and an apex.\r\n\r\nThe =facial surface= is smooth, slightly convex, wide in front, and\r\nnarrow behind. At its lower part it presents the =facial= or =zygomatic\r\ncrest=, which is continuous in front with the similar ridge on the\r\nmaxilla and behind with the zygomatic process of the temporal; the crest\r\nis rough below, where the masseter muscle is attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe =orbital surface= is separated from the facial surface by the\r\nconcave =orbital margin=. It is concave and smooth, and forms part of\r\nthe lower and front wall of the orbit.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal surface= is concave and faces into the maxillary sinus. In\r\nthe young foal a considerable part of it articulates with the maxilla.\r\n\r\nThe =superior border= articulates with the lacrimal chiefly, but to a\r\nsmall extent behind with the maxilla also.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior border= and the =base= articulate with the maxilla.\r\n\r\nThe =apex= is beveled above and is overlapped by the zygomatic process\r\nof the temporal bone.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—Each ossifies in membrane from one or two centers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE TURBINAL BONES\r\n\r\nThese (Ossa turbinata) are delicate, scroll-like bones, four in number,\r\nwhich are attached to the lateral walls of the nasal cavity. They\r\nproject into the cavity and greatly diminish its extent. Each is\r\ncomposed of a very thin lamina, cribriform in many places, and covered\r\non both sides with mucous membrane in the fresh state. They are arranged\r\nin two pairs, superior and inferior.\r\n\r\nThe =superior= or =naso-turbinal= (Concha dorsalis)[17] is somewhat\r\ncylindrical in form, small at its anterior part, and flattened\r\ntransversely. It is attached to the turbinal crest of the nasal bone and\r\nthe nasal plate of the frontal bone. The anterior part is rolled like a\r\nscroll one and a half times, thus inclosing a cavity which communicates\r\nwith the middle meatus nasi. The arrangement is best seen on a\r\ncross-section (Fig. 37). The posterior part is not rolled, but its lower\r\nborder is attached to the lateral nasal wall, thus helping to inclose a\r\nlarge space which is part of the frontal sinus. This cavity is separated\r\nfrom that of the scroll-like part by a transverse septum. The =internal\r\nsurface= is flattened, and is separated from the septum nasi by a narrow\r\ninterval, the =common meatus= (Meatus nasi communis). Another narrow\r\npassage, the =superior meatus= (Meatus nasi superior), separates the\r\nupper surface from the roof of the nasal cavity. The space between the\r\nlower surface and the inferior turbinal is the =middle meatus= (Meatus\r\nnasi medius). The anterior extremity is prolonged toward the nostril by\r\ntwo small bars of cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior= or =maxillo-turbinal bone= (Concha ventralis) is shorter\r\nand smaller posteriorly than the upper one. It is attached to the\r\ninferior turbinal crest, and consists, like the upper one, of an\r\nanterior coiled and a posterior uncoiled portion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  To express briefly the mode of coiling of the two bones of the same\r\n  side we may say that they are rolled toward the septum and each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inferior and posterior borders of the posterior part are attached to\r\nthe maxilla, thus helping to inclose a cavity which is part of the\r\nmaxillary sinus. The lower surface is separated from the floor of the\r\nnasal cavity by the =inferior meatus= (Meatus nasi inferior), which is\r\nmuch larger than the other nasal passages. The anterior extremity is\r\nprolonged to the nostril by a curved bar of cartilage.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—Each ossifies in cartilage from a single center.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE VOMER\r\n\r\nThe =vomer= is a median unpaired bone, which assists in forming the\r\nlower part of the septum nasi. It is composed of a thin lamina which is\r\nbent (except in its posterior part) so as to form a narrow groove\r\n(Sulcus septi narium), in which the lower part of the perpendicular\r\nplate of the ethmoid bone and the septal cartilage are received. The\r\n=lateral surfaces=, right and left, are highest near the posterior end\r\nand diminish gradually to the anterior end; they are slightly convex\r\ndorso-ventrally, and are covered by the nasal mucous membrane during\r\nlife. The =inferior border= is thin and free in its posterior third, and\r\ndivides the posterior nares into right and left halves; in the remainder\r\nof its extent it is wider and is attached to the nasal crest. The\r\n=anterior extremity= lies above the ends of the palatine processes of\r\nthe premaxillæ. The =posterior extremity= consists of two =wings= (Alæ\r\nvomeris) which extend outward below the body of the presphenoid;\r\nposteriorly they form a notch (Incisura vomeris), and laterally join the\r\npalate and pterygoid bones.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The vomer is primitively double, and ossifies from a\r\ncenter on either side in the membrane covering the cartilaginous septum\r\nnasi; the two laminæ then fuse below and form a groove.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MANDIBLE\r\n\r\nThe =mandible= or =inferior maxilla= (Mandibula) is the largest and the\r\nonly movable bone of the face. The two halves of which it consists at\r\nbirth unite during the second or third month, and it is usually\r\ndescribed as a single bone. It carries the lower teeth, and articulates\r\nby its condyles with the squamous temporal on either side. It consists\r\nof a body and two rami.[18]\r\n\r\nThe =body= (Corpus mandibulæ) is the thick anterior part which bears the\r\nincisor teeth. It presents two surfaces and a border. The =lingual= or\r\n=superior surface= (Facies lingualis) is smooth and slightly concave;\r\nduring life it is covered by mucous membrane, and the tip of the tongue\r\noverlies it. The =labial= or =mental surface= (Facies mentalis) is\r\nconvex and is related to the lower lip. It is marked by a median furrow\r\nwhich indicates the position of the primitive symphysis mandibulæ. The\r\ncurved =alveolar border= (Limbus alveolaris) presents six alveoli for\r\nthe incisor teeth, and a little further back two alveoli for the canine\r\nteeth in the male; in the mare the latter are usually absent or small.\r\n\r\nThe =rami= (Rami mandibulæ) extend backward from the body and diverge to\r\ninclose the =submaxillary space= (Spatium mandibulare). Each ramus is\r\nbent so as to consist of a horizontal part (Pars molaris) which bears\r\nthe lower cheek teeth, and a vertical part (Ramus mandibulæ) which is\r\nexpanded and furnishes attachment to powerful muscles; the term =angle=\r\nis applied to the most prominent part of the curve. The ramus presents\r\ntwo surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The =external surface=\r\nis smooth and slightly convex from edge to edge on the horizontal part;\r\nat the junction with the body it presents the =mental foramen= (Foramen\r\nmentale), which is the external opening of the mandibular or inferior\r\ndental canal. On the vertical part it is somewhat concave and presents a\r\nnumber of rough lines for the attachment of the masseter muscle. The\r\n=internal surface= of the horizontal part is smooth, and presents a\r\nshallow longitudinal depression in its middle; above this there is often\r\na faint mylo-hyoid line for the attachment of the muscle of like name.\r\nAt the lower part of the junction with the body there is a small fossa\r\nfor the attachment of the genio-hyoid and genio-glossus muscles. On the\r\nvertical part the surface is concave, and is marked in its lower and\r\nposterior part by rough lines for the attachment of the internal\r\npterygoid muscle. In front of its middle is the =mandibular= or\r\n=inferior maxillary foramen= (Foramen mandibulare), which is the\r\nposterior orifice of the =mandibular= or =inferior dental canal=\r\n(Canalis mandibulæ). The canal curves downward and passes forward below\r\nthe cheek teeth, opening externally at the mental foramen; it is\r\ncontinued into the body of the bone as a small canal (Canalis alveolaris\r\nincisivus), which carries the vessels and nerves to the incisor teeth.\r\nThe =superior= or =alveolar border= forms anteriorly part of the\r\ninteralveolar space; here it is thin. Behind this it is thick and is\r\nexcavated by six alveoli for the lower cheek teeth. Behind the last\r\nalveolus it curves sharply upward and is narrow and rough. In the young\r\nfoal there is commonly a small alveolus for the vestige of the first\r\npremolar (“wolf tooth”) close to the first large one. The =inferior\r\nborder= of the horizontal part is nearly straight; it is thick and\r\nrounded in the young horse, becoming narrower and sharp in old subjects.\r\nAt its posterior part there is a smooth impression (Incisura vasorum)\r\nwhere the facial vessels and parotid duct turn round the bone. Behind\r\nthis point the border curves sharply upward, forming the =angle=\r\n(Angulus mandibulæ); this part is thick and has two roughened lips,\r\ninternal and external, separated by a considerable intermediate space;\r\nnear the condyle it becomes narrower. The =anterior extremity= joins the\r\nbody. The =superior extremity= comprises the =coronoid process= in front\r\nand the =condyle= behind, the two being separated by the =sigmoid notch=\r\n(Incisura mandibulæ), through which the nerve to the masseter muscle\r\npasses. The =coronoid process= (Processus coronoideus) is thin\r\ntransversely and curved slightly inward and backward. It projects upward\r\nin the temporal fossa, and furnishes insertion to the temporal muscle.\r\nThe =condyle= (Capitulum mandibulæ) lies at a much lower level than the\r\nend of the coronoid process. It is elongated transversely and\r\narticulates with the squamous temporal through the medium of an\r\narticular disc. The part below the condyle is usually termed the =neck=\r\n(Collum mandibulæ); on its antero-internal part is a depression (Fovea\r\npterygoidea) for the attachment of the external pterygoid muscle. The\r\nmiddle of the vertical part of the ramus consists to a large extent of a\r\nsingle plate of compact substance which may be so thin in places as to\r\nbe translucent.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The mandible develops from two chief centers in the\r\nconnective tissue which overlies the paired Meckel’s cartilages. At\r\nbirth it consists of two symmetrical halves which meet at a median\r\nsymphysis. Fusion usually occurs in the second or third month.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Age changes.=—These are associated largely with the growth and later\r\n  with the reduction of the teeth. In the young horse, in which the\r\n  teeth are large and are in great part embedded in the bone, the body\r\n  is thick and strongly curved, and the horizontal part of the ramus is\r\n  also thick. Later, as the teeth are extruded from the bone, the body\r\n  becomes flattened and narrower, and the horizontal part of the ramus\r\n  is thinner, especially in its lower part; the angle and the impression\r\n  in front of it are more pronounced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE HYOID BONE\r\n\r\nThe =hyoid bone= (Os hyoideum) is situated chiefly between the vertical\r\nparts of the rami of the mandible, but its upper part extends somewhat\r\nfurther back. It is attached to the petrous temporal bones by rods of\r\ncartilage, and supports the root of the tongue, the pharynx, and larynx.\r\nIt consists of a body, a lingual process, and three pairs of cornua.\r\n\r\nThe =body= or =basihyoid= (Basis ossishyoidei) is a short transverse\r\nbar, compressed dorso-ventrally. The upper surface is concave and smooth\r\nin its middle, and presents at each end a convex facet or tubercle for\r\narticulation with the small cornu. The lower surface is slightly\r\nroughened for muscular attachment. The anterior border carries medially\r\nthe lingual process. The posterior border is concave and smooth in its\r\nmiddle, and carries on either side the thyroid cornu. The body, the\r\nlingual process, and the thyroid processes are fused together, and may\r\nbe compared to a spur or a fork with a very short handle.\r\n\r\nThe =lingual process= (Processus lingualis) projects forward medially\r\nfrom the body, and is embedded in the root of the tongue during life. It\r\nis compressed laterally and has a blunt-pointed free end. The lateral\r\nsurfaces are slightly concave. The upper border is narrow, the lower\r\nthick and irregular.\r\n\r\nThe =thyroid cornua= or =thyrohyoids= (Cornua laryngea)[19] extend\r\nbackward and upward from the lateral parts of the body. They are\r\ncompressed laterally (except at their junction with the body), and their\r\nposterior ends are connected with the anterior cornua of the thyroid\r\ncartilage of the larynx.\r\n\r\nThe =small cornua= or =keratohyoids= (Cornua minora) are short rods\r\nwhich are directed upward and forward from either end of the upper\r\nsurface of the body. Each is somewhat constricted in its middle part and\r\nhas slightly enlarged ends. The lower end has a small concave facet\r\nwhich articulates with the body. The upper end articulates with the\r\ngreat cornu, or with the middle cornu when present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 32.—HYOID BONE OF HORSE, VIEWED FROM THE SIDE AND SOMEWHAT FROM\r\n    IN FRONT.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Body; _b_, lingual process; _c_, thyroid cornu; _c′_, cartilage\r\n    of _c_; _d_, small cornu; _e_, middle cornu; _f_, great cornu; _f′_,\r\n    muscular angle of great cornu; _g_, cartilage of great cornu.\r\n    (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =great cornua= or =stylohyoids= are much the largest parts of the\r\nbone. They are directed upward and backward, and are connected above\r\nwith the base of the petrous temporal bones. Each is a thin plate, seven\r\nor eight inches (ca. 18 to 20 cm.) long, which is slightly curved in its\r\nlength, so that the external surface is concave and smooth. The internal\r\nsurface is convex and smooth. The borders are thin. The upper extremity\r\nis large and forms two angles; the upper angle is connected by a rod of\r\ncartilage with the hyoid process of the petrous temporal bone; the lower\r\nangle is somewhat thickened and rough for muscular attachment. The lower\r\nextremity is small, and articulates with the small or the middle cornu.\r\n\r\nThe =middle cornua= or =epihyoids= are small wedge-shaped pieces or\r\nnodules interposed between the small and great cornua. They are usually\r\ntransitory, and unite with the great cornua in the adult.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The hyoid ossifies in the cartilages of the second and\r\nthird visceral arches. Each part has a separate center, except the\r\nlingual process, which ossifies by extension from the body. The latter\r\nhas primarily two centers (Martin).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SKULL AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\nThe skull of the horse has the form of a long four-sided pyramid, the\r\nbase of which is posterior. It is convenient to exclude the mandible and\r\nhyoid from present consideration. The division between the cranium\r\n(Cranium cerebrale) and the face (Cranium viscerale) may be indicated\r\napproximately by a transverse plane through the anterior margins of the\r\norbits.\r\n\r\nThe =superior= or =frontal surface= (Norma frontalis) is formed by the\r\nupper part of the occipital, the interparietal, parietal, frontal, and\r\nnasal bones. It may be divided into parietal, frontal, nasal, and\r\npremaxillary regions. The parietal region extends from the occipital\r\ncrest to the parieto-frontal or coronal suture. It is marked medially by\r\nthe =external sagittal crest=, which bifurcates in front, the branches\r\nbecoming continuous with the =frontal crests=. The latter curve outward\r\nto the root of the supraorbital process. The =frontal region= is the\r\nwidest part of the surface, and is smooth and almost flat. It is bounded\r\nin front by the naso-frontal suture. On either side of it is the root of\r\nthe =supraorbital process=, pierced by the =supraorbital foramen=. The\r\n=nasal region= is convex from side to side, wide behind, narrow in\r\nfront. Its profile is in some cases nearly straight; in others it is\r\nundulating, with a variably marked depression about its middle and at\r\nthe anterior end. The =premaxillary region= presents the =osseous nasal\r\naperture= (Apertura nasalis ossea) and the =foramen incisivum=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 33.—CRANIAL AND ORBITAL REGIONS OF SKULL OF HORSE, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n    THE ZYGOMATIC ARCH AND SUPRAORBITAL PROCESSES HAVE BEEN SAWN OFF.\r\n\r\n  1, Occipital condyle; 2, condyloid fossa; 3, paramastoid or styloid\r\n    process; 4, occipital crest; 5, external occipital protuberance; 6,\r\n    external auditory meatus; 7, mastoid process; 8, hyoid process; 9,\r\n    stylo-mastoid foramen; 10, muscular process; 11, foramen lacerum\r\n    anterius; 12, postglenoid process; 13, glenoid cavity; 14, temporal\r\n    condyle; 15, Vidian groove; 16, alar canal of pterygoid process\r\n    indicated by arrow; 17, temporal foramen; 18, ethmoidal foramen; 19,\r\n    optic foramen; 20, foramen lacerum orbitale; 21, maxillary foramen;\r\n    22, sphenopalatine foramen; 23, posterior palatine foramen; 24,\r\n    supraorbital foramen (opened); 25, lacrimal fossa; 26, depression\r\n    for origin of obliquus oculi inferior; 27, facial crest; 28,\r\n    maxillary tuberosity; 29, alveolar tuberosity; 30, hamulus of\r\n    pterygoid bone; _S.o._, supraoccipital; _P_, parietal; _S_, squamous\r\n    temporal; _B.o._, basioccipital; _B.s._, basisphenoid; _A.t._,\r\n    temporal wing of sphenoid; _A.o._, orbital wing of sphenoid;\r\n    _Pt.p._, pterygoid process of sphenoid; _P.p._, perpendicular part\r\n    of palate bone; _F,F′_, facial and orbital parts of frontal bone;\r\n    _L,L′_, orbital and facial parts of lacrimal bone; _M_, facial part\r\n    of malar bone; _M.x._, maxilla; _a_, parieto-occipital suture; _b_,\r\n    parieto-temporal or squamous suture; _c_, _d_, spheno-squamous\r\n    suture; _e_, palato-frontal suture; _f_, fronto-lacrimal suture.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lateral surface= (Norma lateralis) may be divided into cranial,\r\norbital, and maxillary or preorbital regions.\r\n\r\nThe =cranial region= presents the temporal fossa, the zygomatic arch,\r\nand the outer part of the petrous temporal bone.\r\n\r\nThe =temporal fossa= is bounded internally by the sagittal and frontal\r\ncrests, externally by the temporal crest and the zygomatic arch, and\r\nbehind by the occipital crest. Its upper and middle parts are rough for\r\nthe attachment of the temporal muscle. In its lower posterior part are\r\nseveral =foramina= which communicate with the parieto-temporal canal.\r\nThe fossa is continuous in front with the orbital cavity.\r\n\r\nThe =zygomatic arch= is formed by the zygomatic processes of the\r\ntemporal, malar, and maxilla. Its ventral face presents the =condyle=\r\nand =glenoid cavity= for articulation with the lower jaw, through the\r\nmedium of the articular disc. Behind the glenoid cavity is the\r\n=postglenoid process=.\r\n\r\nThe =external auditory process= projects outward through a deep notch in\r\nthe lower margin of the squamous temporal below the temporal crest. A\r\nlittle further back is the =mastoid process=, crossed in its upper part\r\nby a groove for the mastoid artery.\r\n\r\nThe =orbital region= comprises the orbit and the pterygo-palatine\r\n=fossa=.\r\n\r\nThe =orbit= is a cavity which incloses the eyeball, with the muscles,\r\nvessels, and nerves associated with it. It is not separated in the\r\nskeleton from the temporal fossa. The =long axis= of the cavity, taken\r\nfrom the optic foramen to the middle of the =inlet=, is directed\r\nforward, outward, and slightly upward. The =inner wall= (Paries\r\nmedialis) is complete and extensive. It is concave and smooth, and is\r\nformed by the frontal and lacrimal and the orbital wing of the sphenoid.\r\nIn its extreme anterior part is the fossa for the lacrimal sac. Behind\r\nthis is a small depression in which the inferior oblique muscle of the\r\neye arises; here the plate which separates the orbit from the maxillary\r\nsinus is very thin. The =upper wall= (Paries superior) is formed by the\r\nfrontal and to a small extent by the lacrimal bone. It presents the\r\nsupraorbital foramen, which perforates the root of the supraorbital\r\nprocess. The =lower wall= (Paries inferior) is very incomplete, and is\r\nformed by the malar, the zygomatic process of the temporal, and to a\r\nsmall extent by the maxilla. The =external boundary= (Paries lateralis)\r\nis the supraorbital process. At the extreme posterior part is the\r\n=orbital group of foramina=. Four are situated in front of the pterygoid\r\ncrest. Of these, the uppermost is the =ethmoidal= or =internal orbital\r\nforamen=, which transmits the ethmoidal vessels and nerve. The =optic\r\nforamen= is situated a little lower and further back; it transmits the\r\noptic nerve. Immediately below the optic is the =foramen lacerum\r\norbitale=, which transmits the ophthalmic, third, sixth, and sometimes\r\nthe fourth nerve; commonly there is a very small =trochlear= or\r\n=pathetic foramen= in the crest for the last-named nerve. The =foramen\r\nrotundum= is below the foramen lacerum, from which it is separated by a\r\nthin plate; it transmits the superior maxillary nerve. The =alar canal=\r\nopens in common with the foramen rotundum, and the anterior opening of\r\nthe pterygoid or Vidian canal is also found here. The =temporal foramen=\r\n(For. alare parvum) is just behind the pterygoid crest and on a level\r\nwith the foramen lacerum. It is the upper opening of a canal which leads\r\nfrom the alar canal, and through it the anterior deep temporal artery\r\nemerges. The =inlet= of the orbital cavity (Aditus orbitæ) is\r\ncircumscribed by a complete bony ring, which is nearly circular. Its\r\nantero-inferior part (Margo infraorbitalis) is smooth and rounded; the\r\nremainder (Margo supraorbitalis) is rough and irregularly notched.\r\nDuring life the cavity is completed by the periorbita or ocular sheath,\r\na conical fibrous membrane, the apex of which is attached around the\r\noptic foramen.\r\n\r\nBelow the orbital cavity is the =pterygo-palatine fossa=. Its wall is\r\nformed by the pterygoid process, the perpendicular part of the palate\r\nbone, and the tuber maxillare. Its deep anterior part (maxillary hiatus)\r\ncontains three foramina. The upper one, the =maxillary foramen=, is the\r\nentrance to the infraorbital canal, which transmits the infraorbital\r\nnerve and vessels. The =sphenopalatine foramen= transmits vessels and\r\nnerves of like name to the nasal cavity. The lower foramen, the\r\n=posterior palatine=, transmits the palatine artery and nerve to the\r\npalatine canal. The upper part of the fossa is smooth, and is crossed by\r\nthe internal maxillary artery and the maxillary nerve. The lower part is\r\nchiefly roughened for the attachment of the internal pterygoid muscle,\r\nbut is crossed in front by a smooth groove in which the palatine vein\r\nlies.\r\n\r\nThe =maxillary= or =preorbital region= is formed chiefly by the maxilla,\r\nbut also by the premaxilla, and the facial parts of the lacrimal and\r\nmalar bones. Its contour is approximately triangular, the base being\r\nposterior. It offers two principal features. The =facial crest= extends\r\nforward from the lower margin of the orbit, and ends abruptly at a point\r\nabout an inch and a half (3 to 4 cm.) above the third or fourth cheek\r\ntooth;[20] its inferior aspect is rough for the attachment of the\r\nmasseter muscle. The =infraorbital foramen= is situated in a transverse\r\nplane about an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.) in front of the end of the crest\r\nand about two inches (5 cm.) above it. The foramen opens forward, and\r\nthrough it the infraorbital artery and nerve emerge. The surface over\r\nthe premolar teeth varies greatly with age, in conformity with the size\r\nof the embedded parts of the teeth. In the young horse the surface here\r\nis strongly convex, the outer plate of bone is thin and even defective\r\nsometimes in places, and the form of the teeth is indicated by eminences\r\n(Juga alveolaria). In the old animal the surface is concave on account\r\nof the extrusion of the teeth from the bone. The downward curve of the\r\npremaxilla is pronounced in the young subject, very slight in the aged.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior= or =basal surface= (Norma basalis), exclusive of the\r\nmandible, consists of cranial, guttural, and palatine regions.\r\n\r\nThe =cranial region= (Basis cranii externa) extends forward to the vomer\r\nand pterygoid processes (Fig. 28). At its posterior end is the =foramen\r\nmagnum=, flanked by the =occipital condyles=. External to the latter is\r\nthe =condyloid fossa=, in which is the =hypoglossal foramen=, which\r\ntransmits the hypoglossal nerve and the condyloid artery and vein.\r\nFurther outward are the =paramastoid= or =styloid processes= (Processus\r\njugulares) of the occipital bone. Extending forward centrally is a\r\nprismatic bar, formed by the basilar part of the occipital and the body\r\nof the sphenoid bone; at the junction of these parts are tubercles for\r\nthe attachment of the ventral straight muscles of the head. On either\r\nside of the basilar part of the occipital is the =foramen lacerum basis\r\ncranii=, bounded externally by the base of the petrous temporal bone. In\r\nfront of these the region becomes very wide on account of the lateral\r\nextension of the =zygomatic processes=, bearing on the ventral aspect\r\nthe =condyle= and =glenoid cavity= for articulation with the mandible.\r\nBeyond this the process turns forward and joins the =zygomatic process=\r\nof the malar, completing the zygomatic arch and the surface for the\r\nattachment of the masseter muscle. On either side of the body of the\r\nsphenoid is the infratemporal fossa, formed by the temporal wing and the\r\nroot of the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone. It is bounded in\r\nfront by the pterygoid crest, which separates it from the orbit and the\r\npterygo-palatine fossa. In it is the =pterygoid= or =alar foramen=,\r\nwhich transmits the internal maxillary artery. A little lower is the\r\nentrance to the pterygoid (Vidian) =canal=.\r\n\r\nThe =guttural region= presents the pharyngeal orifice of the nasal\r\ncavity. This is elliptical and is divided in its depth medially by the\r\nvomer into two =posterior nares= or =choanæ=. It is bounded in front and\r\nlaterally by the palate and pterygoid bones, behind by the vomer. It is\r\nflanked by the hamular process of the pterygoid bones. The plane of the\r\nopening is nearly horizontal, and the length is about twice the width.\r\n\r\nThe =palatine region= comprises a little more than half of the entire\r\nlength of the base of the skull (Fig. 31). The =hard palate= (Palatum\r\ndurum) is concave from side to side, and in its length also in the\r\nanterior part. It is formed by the palatine processes of the premaxillæ\r\nand maxillæ, and the horizontal parts of the palate bones. It is\r\ncircumscribed in front and laterally by the =superior alveolar arch=, in\r\nwhich the upper teeth are implanted. The =interalveolar space= (Margo\r\ninteralveolaris) is that part of the arch in which alveoli are not\r\npresent. Behind the last alveolus is the =alveolar tuberosity=, and\r\ninternal to this is a =groove= for the palatine vein. In the middle line\r\nis the =median palatine suture= (Sutura palatina mediana). In the line\r\nof the suture, a little behind the central incisors, is the =foramen\r\nincisivum=, through which the palato-labial artery passes. On either\r\nside, parallel with the alveolar part of the maxilla, is the =palatine\r\ngroove= (Sulcus palatinus), which contains the palatine vessels and\r\nnerve. It is continuous at the anterior palatine foramen with the\r\npalatine canal, which is situated between the maxilla and the palate\r\nbone. The =palatine cleft= (Fissura palatina) is the narrow interval\r\nalong the outer margin of the palatine process of the premaxilla; it is\r\nclosed in the fresh state by cartilage. Scattered along each side of the\r\npalate are several vascular foramina. The =transverse palatine suture=\r\n(Sutura palatina transversa) is about half an inch from the posterior\r\nborder. The latter is in a plane through the last molar teeth, and is\r\nconcave and free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 34.—CRANIAL CAVITY OF HORSE AS SEEN ON SAGITTAL SECTION OF SKULL.\r\n\r\n  _O_, Frontal sinus; _r_, sphenoidal sinus; _t_, cerebral compartment\r\n    of cranium; 1–3, ridges (juga) corresponding to fissures of lateral\r\n    surface of cerebrum; 4, groove for middle cerebral artery; 5,\r\n    entrance to for. lacerum orbitale; 6, entrance to optic foramen; 7,\r\n    8, grooves on sphenoid bone; 9, incisura spinosa; 9′, groove for\r\n    middle meningeal artery; 10, fossa for pyriform lobe of cerebrum;\r\n    11, incisura ovalis; 12, incisura carotica; 13, internal auditory\r\n    meatus; 14, foramen lacerum basis cranii; 15, hypoglossal foramen;\r\n    16, petrous temporal; 17, orifice of aquæductus vestibuli; 18,\r\n    orifice of aquæductus cochleæ; 19, foramen magnum; 20, petrosal\r\n    crest; 21, two plates of frontal bone; 22, supraoccipital; 23,\r\n    basioccipital; 24, tentorium osseum; 25, body of sphenoid. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =nuchal surface= (Norma occipitalis) is formed by the\r\noccipital bone. It is trapezoidal in outline, wider below than above,\r\nconcave dorso-ventrally, convex transversely. It is separated from the\r\nsuperior surface by the =occipital crest=, and from the lateral surfaces\r\nby the =superior curved lines= (Lineæ nuchæ superiores). Below the crest\r\nare two rough areas for the attachment of the complexus muscles. A\r\nlittle lower is a central eminence on the sides of which the ligamentum\r\nnuchæ is attached. At the lowest part centrally is the =foramen magnum=,\r\nat which the brain and spinal cord meet; this is bounded laterally by\r\nthe =occipital condyles=, which are flanked by the =paramastoid= or\r\n=styloid processes= (Processus jugulares).\r\n\r\nThe =apex= of the skull is formed by the bodies of the premaxillæ and\r\nmandible, carrying the incisor teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CRANIAL CAVITY\r\n\r\nThis cavity incloses the brain, with its membranes and vessels. It is\r\nrelatively small and is ovoid in shape.\r\n\r\nThe =superior wall= or =roof= (Calvaria) is formed by the\r\nsupraoccipital, interparietal, parietal, and frontal bones. In the\r\nmiddle line is the internal sagittal crest, which joins the crista galli\r\nin front, and furnishes attachment to the falx cerebri. Posteriorly the\r\ncrest is continued by the sharp anterior margin of the =tentorium\r\nosseum=, which projects downward and forward into the cavity, and gives\r\nattachment to the tentorium cerebelli by its sharp lateral edges. Behind\r\nthis the roof is grooved centrally for the middle lobe or vermis of the\r\ncerebellum. Transverse grooves pass from the base of the tentorium\r\nosseum to the parieto-temporal canals. The anterior part of the roof is\r\nhollowed by the frontal sinus. The occipital part is very thick and\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral walls= are formed by the occipital, parietal, temporal, and\r\nfrontal bones, and in part by the orbital wings of the sphenoid. Each is\r\ncrossed obliquely by the =petrosal crest=, which concurs with the\r\nprojecting margin of the parietal bone and the tentorium osseum in\r\ndividing the cavity into cerebral and cerebellar compartments. Behind\r\nthe crest is a depression for the lateral lobe (hemisphere) of the\r\ncerebellum. Below this are the internal auditory meatus and the openings\r\nof the aquæductus vestibuli and aquæductus cochleæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 35.—FLOOR OF CRANIAL CAVITY OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The roots of the cranial nerves are shown on the left side and are\r\n    designated by number. _I_, Anterior cranial fossa; _II_, middle\r\n    cranial fossa; _III_, posterior cranial fossa; _a_, ethmoidal fossa;\r\n    _b_, ethmoidal foramen; _c_, foramen for nasal branch of ophthalmic\r\n    artery; _d_, orbital wing of sphenoid bone; _e_, optic fossa; _f_,\r\n    sella turcica; _g_, spheno-occipital crest; _h_, _h′_, dotted line\r\n    indicating contour of pituitary body; _h″_, slight elevation\r\n    representing dorsum sellæ; _i_, _k_, grooves for nerves and\r\n    cavernous sinus; _l_, depression for pyriform lobe of cerebrum; _m_,\r\n    groove for middle meningeal artery; _n_, depression for pons; _o_,\r\n    foramen lacerum anterius; _p_, foramen lacerum posterius; _q_,\r\n    incisura carotica; _q′_, incisura ovalis; _q″_, incisura spinosa;\r\n    _r_, depression for medulla oblongata; _s_, hypoglossal foramen;\r\n    _t_, internal auditory meatus; _u_, foramen magnum; _v_, frontal\r\n    sinus; _w_, zygomatic process of temporal bone; _x_, section of\r\n    petrous temporal; _y_, section of occipital bone; _z_, crista galli;\r\n    1, 1′, 1″, dotted lines indicating position of olfactory tracts and\r\n    peduncle. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe roof and lateral walls are marked by digital impressions and\r\nvascular grooves.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior wall= or =floor= (Basis cranii interna) may be regarded as\r\nforming three fossæ. The =anterior fossa= (Fossa cranii anterior)\r\nsupports the frontal and olfactory parts of the cerebrum. It is formed\r\nchiefly by the presphenoid, and lies at a higher level than the middle\r\nfossa. In front the fossa is divided medially by the =crista galli=,\r\nlateral to which are the deep =ethmoidal= or =olfactory fossæ= for the\r\nolfactory lobes. The =ethmoidal= or =internal orbital foramen=\r\nperforates the cranial wall at the outer side of these fossæ. Further\r\nback the central part of the surface is slightly elevated, and is\r\nflanked by shallow depressions which support the olfactory peduncles.\r\nPosteriorly is a bony shelf which covers the entrance to the =optic\r\nforamina=; the edge of this shelf and the posterior borders of the\r\norbital wings of the sphenoid may be taken as the line of demarcation\r\nbetween the anterior and middle fossæ. The =middle fossa= (Fossa cranii\r\nmedia) is the widest part of the cavity. It extends backward to the\r\ninternal spheno-occipital and petrosal crests, thus corresponding to the\r\npostsphenoid. In its middle is a small fossa, the sella turcica, in\r\nwhich the pituitary body, or hypophysis cerebri, is situated. On either\r\nside are two grooves for nerves; the inner one transmits the ophthalmic,\r\nthird, and sixth nerves to the foramen lacerum orbitale; the outer one\r\nleads to the foramen rotundum, and lodges the maxillary nerve. External\r\nto the grooves is a depression for the pyriform lobe of the cerebrum.\r\nThe =posterior fossa= (Fossa cranii posterior) corresponds to the\r\nbasilar part of the occipital bone. It contains the medulla, pons, and\r\ncerebellum. In front is a median depression (Fossa pontis) for the pons.\r\nThe surface behind this is concave transversely and slopes gently\r\ndownward to the foramen magnum; it supports the medulla. On either side\r\nare the =foramen lacerum basis cranii= and the =hypoglossal foramen=.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior= or =nasal wall= is formed by the cribriform plate of the\r\nethmoid, which separates the cranium from the nasal cavity. It is\r\nperforated by numerous foramina for the passage of the olfactory\r\nnerve-bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 36.—MEDIAN SECTION OF SKULL OF HORSE WITHOUT THE MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\n  The septum nasi is removed, but the mucous membrane on the turbinal\r\n    bones is retained. _a_, _a′_, Superior turbinal bone, dotted line\r\n    indicating limit between anterior coiled part and posterior uncoiled\r\n    part; _b_, _b′_, superior turbinal folds, inclosing bars of\r\n    cartilage; _c_, fold of mucous membrane formed by union of _b_ and\r\n    _b′_; _d_, _d′_, anterior coiled and posterior uncoiled part of\r\n    inferior turbinal, dotted line indicating septum between them; _e_,\r\n    _f_, inferior turbinal folds, former (alar fold) inclosing bar of\r\n    cartilage; _g_, _h_, _i_, superior, middle, inferior meatus; _o_,\r\n    _o′_, frontal sinus; partial septum between _o_ and _o′_; _q_, nasal\r\n    part of frontal sinus (nasal sinus); _r_, lateral mass of ethmoid\r\n    bone; _s_, sphenoidal sinus; _t_, cranial cavity; _u_, opening made\r\n    in superior turbinal bone at point where drainage of frontal sinus\r\n    may be obtained.

It is divided into right and left\r\nhalves by a median =septum nasi=. The =lateral walls= are formed by the\r\nmaxilla, premaxilla, and the perpendicular part of the palate bones.\r\nAttached to them are the turbinal bones, which subdivide each nasal\r\nfossa into three =meatuses= (Meatus nasi). This wall is crossed\r\nobliquely by the =canal= and =groove= for the =naso-lacrimal duct=, and\r\nits posterior part is perforated by the =sphenopalatine foramen=. The\r\n=superior wall= or =roof= is formed by the frontal and nasal bones. It\r\nis concave from side to side, and nearly straight longitudinally, except\r\nin the posterior part, where it curves downward. It presents a median\r\nelevation, the =nasal crest=. The =inferior wall= or =floor= is formed\r\nby the palatine processes of the premaxillæ and maxillæ, and the\r\nhorizontal parts of the palate bones. It is wider but considerably\r\nshorter than the roof. It is concave transversely, and nearly horizontal\r\nfrom before backward, except in the posterior third, where there is a\r\nslight declivity. The anterior part presents a median groove for the\r\ncartilaginous septum, and a furrow for the organ of Jacobson on either\r\nside. On either side of the palatine processes of the premaxillæ is the\r\n=palatine cleft=.\r\n\r\nThe =septum nasi= is incomplete in the macerated skull. It is formed by\r\nthe perpendicular plate of the ethmoid behind, and the vomer below. In\r\nthe fresh state it is completed by a plate of cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =superior meatus= (Meatus nasi superior) is a narrow passage between\r\nthe roof and the superior turbinal bone. It ends at the cribriform plate\r\nof the ethmoid. The =middle meatus= (Meatus nasi medius) is the space\r\nbetween the two turbinal bones. In its posterior part is the very narrow\r\nopening into the maxillary sinus. The =inferior meatus= (Meatus nasi\r\ninferior) is the channel along the floor which is overhung by the\r\ninferior turbinal bone. It is much the largest and is the direct path\r\nbetween the anterior and posterior nares.\r\n\r\nThe external aperture is bounded by the nasal bones and the premaxillæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 37.—CROSS-SECTION OF NASAL REGION OF SKULL OF HORSE; THE SECTION\r\n    PASSES THROUGH THE ANTERIOR END OF THE FACIAL CREST, AND BETWEEN THE\r\n    THIRD AND FOURTH CHEEK TEETH.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Superior, _b_, inferior turbinal bone; _c_, _d_, cavities of _a_\r\n    and _b_; _e_, common meatus; _f_, _g_, _h_, superior, middle,\r\n    inferior meatus; _i_, _k_, passages to cavities of turbinal bones;\r\n    _l_, naso-lacrimal duct; _m_, infraorbital canal; _n_, anterior end\r\n    of maxillary sinus; _o_, septal cartilage.

(After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe posterior extremity or fundus is separated from the cranial cavity\r\nby the cribriform plate of the ethmoid, and is largely occupied by the\r\nlateral masses of that bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE PARANASAL SINUSES\r\n\r\nConnected directly or indirectly with the nasal cavity, of which they\r\nare diverticula, are four pairs of air-sinuses (Sinus paranasales),\r\nviz., maxillary, frontal, sphenopalatine, and ethmoidal.\r\n\r\nThe =maxillary sinus= (Sinus maxillaris) is the largest. Its external\r\nwall is formed by the maxilla, the lacrimal, and the malar. It is\r\nbounded internally by the maxilla, the inferior turbinal, and the\r\nlateral mass of the ethmoid bone. It extends backward to a transverse\r\nplane in front of the root of the supraorbital process, and its anterior\r\nlimit is indicated approximately by a line drawn from the anterior end\r\nof the facial crest to the infraorbital foramen. Its upper boundary\r\ncorresponds to a line drawn backward from the supraorbital foramen\r\nparallel to the facial crest. The floor is formed by the alveolar part\r\nof the maxilla; it is very irregular and is crossed by bony plates\r\nrunning in various directions. The last three cheek teeth project up\r\ninto the cavity to an extent which varies with age; they are covered by\r\na thin plate of bone. The cavity is divided into anterior and posterior\r\nparts by an oblique =septum=. The outer margin of the septum is commonly\r\nabout one and a half to two inches (ca. 3.5 to 5 cm.) from the anterior\r\nend of the facial crest; from here it is directed inward, backward, and\r\nupward. The upper part of the septum (formed by the posterior end of the\r\ninferior turbinal bone) is very delicate and usually cribriform.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The position of the septum is quite variable. It is not rare to find\r\n  it further forward, and in some cases it is further back than is\r\n  stated above. In the recent state, _i. e._, when covered by the mucous\r\n  membrane on both surfaces, it is nearly always complete, but in very\r\n  exceptional cases there is an opening of variable size in the upper\r\n  part.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =anterior compartment=, often called the =inferior maxillary sinus=,\r\nis partially divided by the infraorbital canal into an external\r\nmaxillary part and an internal smaller turbinal part. The latter\r\ncommunicates with the middle meatus by a very narrow slit situated at\r\nits highest part. The =posterior compartment=, often called the\r\n=superior maxillary sinus=, is also crossed by the infraorbital canal,\r\ninternal to which it opens freely into the sphenopalatine sinus. It\r\ncommunicates dorsally with the frontal sinus through the large oval\r\n=fronto-maxillary opening=, situated at the level of the osseous\r\nlacrimal canal and the corresponding part of the inner wall of the\r\norbit; the orifice is commonly about one and a half to two inches (ca. 4\r\nto 5 cm.) long and an inch or more (2 to 3 cm.) wide. Just in front of\r\nthis, and covered by a thin plate, is the narrow =naso-maxillary\r\nfissure= (Aditus naso-maxillaris), by which the sinus opens into the\r\nposterior part of the middle meatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The foregoing statements refer to the arrangement in the average adult\r\n  animal. In the foal the cavity (with the exception of its turbinal\r\n  part) is largely occupied by the developing teeth. In horses five to\r\n  six years of age the maxillary part of the sinus is still filled up to\r\n  a large degree by the embedded parts of the teeth. As the teeth are\r\n  extruded to compensate the wear, more and more of the cavity becomes\r\n  free, until in old age only the short roots project up in the floor,\r\n  covered by a layer of bone. Other facts in this connection will be\r\n  given in the description of the teeth. In exceptional cases the\r\n  posterior part of the inferior turbinal is smaller than usual and\r\n  leaves a considerable interval, through which the maxillary sinus\r\n  communicates with the nasal cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 39.—SKULL OF HORSE, LATERAL VIEW WITHOUT MANDIBLE.

The frontal part is bounded chiefly by the two plates of\r\nthe frontal bone, but its floor is formed in part by the lateral mass of\r\nthe ethmoid. It extends forward to a plane through the anterior margins\r\nof the orbits, backward to one through the temporal condyles, and\r\noutward into the root of the supraorbital process. It is separated from\r\nthe sinus of the opposite side by a complete =septum=. It is partially\r\nsubdivided by a number of bony plates. The turbinal part is situated in\r\nthe posterior part of the superior turbinal bone, roofed in by the nasal\r\nand lacrimal bones. It extends forward to a transverse plane about\r\nhalf-way between the anterior margin of the orbit and the end of the\r\nfacial crest. Behind it is in free communication with the frontal part\r\nover the lateral mass of the ethmoid. It is separated from the nasal\r\ncavity by the thin turbinal plate. The frontal and maxillary sinuses\r\ncommunicate through the large opening described above.\r\n\r\nThe =sphenopalatine sinus= (Sinus sphenopalatinus) consists of two parts\r\nwhich communicate under the lateral mass of the ethmoid. The sphenoidal\r\n(posterior) part is excavated in the body of the presphenoid. The\r\npalatine (anterior) part is between the two plates of the perpendicular\r\npart of the palate bone, under the lateral mass of the ethmoid; it\r\ncommunicates freely with the maxillary sinus. The septum between the\r\nright and left sinuses is not usually median in the sphenoidal part.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In about one-third of the cases (according to Paulli) the sphenoidal\r\n  and palatine parts are separated by a transverse septum, and the\r\n  sphenoidal part then communicates only with the lower ethmoidal\r\n  meatuses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term =ethmoidal sinus= is often applied to the cavity of the largest\r\nethmoturbinal. It communicates with the maxillary sinus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 40.—SKULL OF HORSE, DORSAL VIEW, WITH SINUSES EXPOSED BY REMOVAL\r\n    OF THE OUTER PLATE OF BONE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Frontal bone; _2_, nasal bone; _3_, lacrimal bone; _4_, maxilla;\r\n    _a_, posterior part of frontal sinus; _a′_, middle part of frontal\r\n    sinus; _b_, anterior (turbinal) part of frontal sinus; _c_, lateral\r\n    mass of ethmoid bone; _d_, roof of superior meatus; _e_,\r\n    fronto-maxillary opening; _f_, naso-maxillary opening below plate\r\n    which forms the anterior margin of _e_; _g_, _h_, posterior and\r\n    anterior compartments of maxillary sinus—often called the superior\r\n    and inferior maxillary sinuses; _i_, septum between _g_ and _h_;\r\n    _k_, orbit; _l_, point at which superior turbinal bone may be\r\n    perforated to obtain drainage into nasal cavity.

It\r\nis curved slightly and slopes outward in adaptation to the form of the\r\nthoracic wall. It is triangular in outline, and has two surfaces, three\r\nborders, and three angles.\r\n\r\nThe =external surface= or =dorsum= (Facies lateralis s. dorsalis) is\r\ndivided into two fossæ by the =spine= (Spina scapulæ), which extends\r\nfrom the vertebral border to the neck of the bone, where it gradually\r\nsubsides. The free edge of the spine is thick, rough, and in great part\r\nsubcutaneous. A little above its middle is a variable prominence, the\r\n=tubercle= of the spine (Tuber spinæ), to which the trapezius muscle is\r\nattached. The =supraspinous fossa= (Fossa supraspinata) is situated in\r\nfront of the spine, and the =infraspinous fossa= (Fossa infraspinata)\r\nbehind it. The former is much the smaller of the two; it is smooth and\r\nis occupied by the supraspinatus muscle. The infraspinous fossa lodges\r\nthe infraspinatus muscle; it is wide and smooth in its upper part,\r\nnarrower below, where it is marked by several rough lines for the\r\nattachment of the teres minor muscle; near the neck is the nutrient\r\nforamen, and a little lower is a vascular groove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 41.—LEFT SCAPULA OF HORSE, EXTERNAL VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas\r\n    d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =costal surface= or =venter= (Facies costalis) is hollowed in its\r\nlength by the =subscapular fossa= (Fossa subscapularis); this occupies\r\nnearly the whole of the lower part of the surface, but is pointed above\r\nand separates two rough triangular areas (Facies serrata), to which the\r\nserratus magnus is attached. In the lower third there is a vascular\r\nfurrow with several branches.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior= or =cervical border= (Margo cranialis) is convex and\r\nrough above, concave and smooth below.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =dorsal border= (Margo caudalis) is slightly concave.\r\nIt is thick and rough in its upper third, thin in its middle, and\r\nthickens again below.\r\n\r\nThe =superior= or =vertebral border= (Margo dorsalis s. basis) carries\r\nthe =scapular cartilage= (Cartilago scapulæ). In the young subject the\r\nedge of the bone is thick, and is pitted by impressions into which the\r\ncartilage fits. The cartilage is the unossified part of the fœtal\r\nscapula. Its lower edge fits the depressions and elevations of the bone.\r\nIt thins out toward the free edge, which is convex and lies alongside of\r\nthe upper parts of the vertebral spines. In front it continues the line\r\nof the scapula, but behind it forms a rounded projection. The lower part\r\nof the cartilage undergoes more or less ossification, so that the\r\nvertebral border of the bone in old subjects is thin, irregular, and\r\nporous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 42.—LEFT SCAPULA OF HORSE, COSTAL SURFACE.—(After Schmaltz, Atlas\r\n    d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =anterior= or =cervical angle= (Angulus cranialis) is at the\r\njunction of the anterior and vertebral borders and lies opposite to the\r\nsecond thoracic spine. It is relatively thin and is about a right angle.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =dorsal angle= (Angulus caudalis) is thick and rough;\r\nits position can be determined readily in the living animal.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior= or =articular angle= (Angulus glenoidalis) is joined to\r\nthe body of the bone by the =neck= of the scapula (Collum scapulæ). It\r\nis enlarged, especially in the sagittal direction. It bears the =glenoid\r\ncavity= (Cavitas glenoidalis) for articulation with the head of the\r\nhumerus. The cavity is oval in outline, and its margin is cut into in\r\nfront by the =glenoid notch= (Incisura glenoidalis), and is rounded off\r\nexternally; just above its postero-external part is a tubercle to which\r\na tendon of the teres minor is attached. The =bicipital tuberosity= or\r\n=tuber scapulæ= is the large rough prominence in front, to which the\r\ntendon of origin of the biceps brachii is attached; projecting from its\r\ninner side is the small =coracoid process= (Processus coracoideus), from\r\nwhich the coraco-brachialis muscle arises.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The scapula has four centers of ossification, viz., one\r\neach for the body of the bone, the bicipital and coracoid processes, the\r\nanterior part of the glenoid cavity, and the tuber spinæ. The last\r\nossifies after birth and fuses with the spine about the third year. The\r\nbicipital tuberosity and coracoid fuse with the body of the bone about\r\nthe end of the first year.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In old subjects the spongy substance disappears at the middle part of\r\n  the fossæ, so that the bone consists here of a thin layer of compact\r\n  substance. Considerable ossification of the cartilage is usual, the\r\n  borders become much rougher, the muscular lines are more pronounced,\r\n  and a medullary cavity may appear in the neck. Much variation occurs\r\n  in dimensions and slope. The average ratio between the length and\r\n  breadth (scapular index) is about 1 ∶ 0.5, but in many cases the base\r\n  is relatively wider. The inclination on a horizontal plane varies from\r\n  50 to 65 degrees. Exceptionally the coracoid process reaches a length\r\n  of an inch or more (2½ to 3 cm.), and the chief nutrient foramen may\r\n  be on the posterior border or in the subscapular fossa.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 43.—DISTAL END OF LEFT SCAPULA OF HORSE, END VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE HUMERUS\r\n\r\nThe =humerus= is a long bone which extends from the shoulder above,\r\nwhere it articulates with the scapula, to the elbow below and behind,\r\nwhere it articulates with the radius and ulna. It is directed obliquely\r\ndownward and backward, forming an angle of about 55 degrees with a\r\nhorizontal plane. It may be divided into a shaft and two extremities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 44.—PROXIMAL END OF LEFT HUMERUS OF HORSE, END VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= or =body= (Corpus humeri) is irregularly cylindrical and has\r\na twisted appearance. It may be regarded as having four surfaces. The\r\n=external surface= is smooth and is spirally curved, forming the\r\n=musculo-spiral groove= (Sulcus musculi brachialis), which contains the\r\nbrachialis muscle; the groove is continuous with the posterior surface\r\nabove and winds around toward the front below. The =internal surface= is\r\nnearly straight in its length, rounded from side to side, and blends\r\nwith the anterior and posterior surfaces. Just above its middle is the\r\n=internal= or =teres tubercle= (Tuberositas teres), to which the tendon\r\nof the latissimus dorsi and teres major muscles is attached. The\r\n=nutrient foramen= is in the lower third of this surface. The =anterior\r\nsurface= is triangular, wide and smooth above, narrow and roughened\r\nbelow. It is separated from the external surface by a distinct border,\r\nwhich bears on its upper part the =deltoid tuberosity= (Tuberositas\r\ndeltoidea). From the latter a rough line curves upward and backward to\r\nthe outer surface of the neck, and gives origin to the external head of\r\nthe triceps muscle. Below the tuberosity the border inclines forward,\r\nbecomes less salient, and ends at the coronoid fossa. The =posterior\r\nsurface= is rounded from side to side and smooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 45.—LEFT HUMERUS OF HORSE, INTERNAL SURFACE. (After Schmaltz,\r\n    Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 46.—LEFT HUMERUS OF HORSE, EXTERNAL SURFACE. (After Schmaltz,\r\n    Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =proximal extremity= consists of the head, neck, two tuberosities,\r\nand the bicipital groove. The =head= (Caput humeri) presents an almost\r\ncircular convex articular surface, which is about twice as extensive as\r\nthe glenoid cavity of the scapula, with which it articulates. In front\r\nof the head is a fossa, in which are several foramina. The neck (Collum\r\nhumeri) is well defined behind, but is practically absent elsewhere. The\r\n=external tuberosity= (Tuberculum majus) is placed antero-externally,\r\nand consists of two parts; the anterior part forms the outer boundary of\r\nthe bicipital groove and gives attachment to the external branch of the\r\nsupraspinatus muscle; the posterior part gives attachment to the short\r\ninsertion of the infraspinatus, while its outer surface is coated with\r\ncartilage, over which the chief tendon of the same muscle passes to be\r\ninserted into a triangular facet on the outer aspect of the anterior\r\npart. The =internal tuberosity= (Tuberculum minus) is less salient, and\r\nconsists of anterior and posterior parts; the anterior part forms the\r\ninner boundary of the bicipital groove, and furnishes insertion to the\r\ninner branch of the supraspinatus above, and the posterior deep pectoral\r\nmuscle below; the posterior part gives attachment to the subscapularis\r\nmuscle. The =bicipital= or =intertubercular groove= (Sulcus\r\nintertubercularis) is situated in front; it is bounded by the anterior\r\nparts of the tuberosities, and is subdivided by an intermediate ridge.\r\nThe groove is covered in the fresh state by cartilage, and lodges the\r\ntendon of origin of the biceps brachii muscle. Just below the\r\nintermediate ridge is a small fossa in which several foramina open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 47.—LEFT HUMERUS OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas\r\n    d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =distal extremity= has an oblique surface for articulation with the\r\nradius and ulna, which consists of two condyles of very unequal size,\r\nseparated by a ridge. The =internal condyle= (Condylus medialis) is much\r\nthe larger, and is crossed by a sagittal groove, on the anterior part of\r\nwhich there is usually a synovial fossa. Posteriorly the groove extends\r\nupward considerably above the rest of the articular surface and reaches\r\nthe olecranon fossa, and this part articulates with the semilunar notch\r\nof the ulna. The =external condyle= (Condylus lateralis) is much smaller\r\nand is placed somewhat lower and further back, giving the extremity an\r\noblique appearance; it is marked by a wide shallow groove. The =coronoid\r\nfossa= (Fossa coronoidea) is situated in front above the groove on the\r\ninternal condyle; it furnishes origin to part of the extensor carpi, and\r\nexternal to it is a rough depression from which the anterior or common\r\nextensor of the digit arises. Behind and above the condyles are two\r\nthick ridges, the epicondyles. The =internal= or =flexor epicondyle=\r\n(Epicondylus medialis s. flexorius) is the more salient; it furnishes\r\norigin to flexor muscles of the carpus and digit, and presents\r\ninternally a tubercle for the attachment of the internal lateral\r\nligament of the elbow joint. The =external= or =extensor epicondyle=\r\n(Epicondylus lateralis s. extensorius) bears externally the =external\r\nsupracondyloid crest= (Crista condyloidea lateralis), which forms here\r\nthe outer boundary of the musculo-spiral groove, and gives origin to the\r\nextensor carpi. Below this is a rough excavation in which the external\r\nlateral ligament is attached. The lower border of the epicondyle gives\r\nattachment to the flexor carpi externus. Between the epicondyles is the\r\ndeep =olecranon fossa= (Fossa olecrani).\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The humerus ossifies from six centers, viz., three\r\nprimary centers for the shaft and epiphyses, and three secondary centers\r\nfor the external tuberosity, the deltoid tuberosity, and the internal\r\ncondyle. The proximal end fuses with the shaft at about three and\r\none-half years, the distal at about one and a half years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE RADIUS\r\n\r\nThe =radius= is much the larger of the two bones of the forearm in the\r\nhorse. It extends in a vertical direction from the elbow, where it\r\narticulates with the humerus, to the carpus below. It is gently curved,\r\nthe convexity being anterior. It consists of a shaft and two\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= (Corpus radii) is curved in its length, somewhat flattened\r\nfrom before backward, and expanded at its ends. It presents for\r\ndescription two surfaces and two borders. The =anterior surface= (Facies\r\ndorsalis) is smooth, slightly convex in its length, and rounded from\r\nside to side. The =posterior surface= (Facies volaris) is\r\ncorrespondingly concave in its length and is flattened in the transverse\r\ndirection. At its upper part there is a smooth shallow groove, which\r\nconcurs with the ulna in the formation of the =interosseous space= of\r\nthe forearm; the nutrient foramen is in the lower part of this groove.\r\nBelow this there is in the young subject a narrow, rough, triangular\r\narea to which the ulna is attached by an interosseous ligament; in the\r\nadult the two bones are fused here. A variable rough elevation below the\r\nmiddle of the surface and close to the internal border gives attachment\r\nto the superior check ligament. The =internal border= (Margo medialis)\r\nis slightly concave in its length and is largely subcutaneous; at its\r\nproximal end there is a smooth area on which the tendon of insertion of\r\nthe brachialis muscle lies, and a small rough area just below gives\r\nattachment to that muscle and the long internal lateral ligament of the\r\nelbow joint. The =external border= (Margo lateralis) is more strongly\r\ncurved, but presents no special features.\r\n\r\nThe =proximal extremity= or =head= (Capitulum radii) is flattened from\r\nbefore backward and wide transversely. It presents an articular surface\r\n(Fovea capituli) which corresponds to that on the distal end of the\r\nhumerus; it is crossed by a central sagittal ridge, which has a synovial\r\nfossa on its posterior part, and ends in front at a prominent lip, the\r\n=coronoid process= (Processus coronoideus). Just below the posterior\r\nborder there are two concave facets for articulation with the ulna, and\r\nbetween these and the interosseous space is a quadrilateral rough area\r\nat which the two bones are united by an interosseous ligament. At the\r\ninner side of the anterior surface is the =bicipital tuberosity=\r\n(Tuberositas radii), into which the biceps tendon is inserted. The\r\n=internal tuberosity= is continuous with the preceding eminence, and\r\nfurnishes attachment to the short part of the internal lateral ligament.\r\nThe =external tuberosity= is more salient; it gives attachment to the\r\nexternal lateral ligament and to the anterior and lateral extensor\r\nmuscles of the digit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 48.—LEFT RADIUS AND ULNA OF HORSE, EXTERNAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 49.—LEFT RADIUS AND ULNA OF HORSE, POSTERIOR VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =distal extremity= is also compressed from before backward. It\r\npresents the =carpal articular surface= (Facies articularis carpea)\r\nwhich consists of three parts. The inner facet is the largest, is\r\nquadrilateral, concavo-convex from before backward, and articulates with\r\nthe radial carpal bone (or scaphoid); the middle one is somewhat similar\r\nin form but smaller, and articulates with the intermediate carpal bone\r\n(or semilunar); the outer facet is smaller, is convex, and articulates\r\nbelow with the ulnar carpal (or cuneiform) and behind with the accessory\r\ncarpal (or pisiform). The anterior surface presents three =grooves=,\r\nseparated by ridges. The middle one is vertical and gives passage to the\r\ntendon of the extensor carpi radialis; the outer one is similar and\r\ncontains the tendon of the anterior extensor of the digit; the inner one\r\nis small and oblique and lodges the tendon of the extensor carpi\r\nobliquus. The posterior aspect is crossed by a rough ridge, below which\r\nare three depressions. On either side is a tuberosity (Tuberculum\r\nligamenti) to which the lateral ligament is attached. The outer one is\r\nmarked by a small vertical groove for the passage of the lateral\r\nextensor tendon.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The radius ossifies from four centers, viz., one each for\r\nthe shaft, the two extremities, and the outer part of the distal end;\r\nthe last is morphologically the distal end of the ulna which has fused\r\nwith the radius, and the line of fusion is often indicated by a distinct\r\ngroove on the carpal articular surface. The proximal extremity unites\r\nwith the shaft at about one and a half years, the distal end at about\r\nthree and a half years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 50.—UPPER HALF OF RADIUS AND ULNA OF HORSE, INTERNAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE ULNA\r\n\r\nThe =ulna= of the horse is a reduced long bone situated behind the\r\nradius, with which it is partially fused in the adult.\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= (Corpus ulnæ) is three-sided and tapers to a point below.\r\nThe =anterior surface= (Facies dorsalis) is applied to the posterior\r\nsurface of the radius, and below the interosseous space the two bones\r\nare fused in the adult. The surface which enters into the formation of\r\nthe space is smooth and usually presents a small nutrient foramen,\r\ndirected upward. Above the space it is rough and is attached to the\r\nradius by an interosseous ligament which is usually permanent. The\r\n=internal surface= (Facies medialis) is smooth and slightly concave. The\r\n=external surface= (Facies lateralis) is flattened. The =internal= and\r\n=external borders= are thin and sharp, except at the interosseous space.\r\nThe =posterior border= is slightly concave in its length and is rounded.\r\nThe lower end is pointed and is usually a little below the middle of the\r\nradius. It is commonly continued by a fibrous cord to the distal\r\nexternal tuberosity of the radius, but this band may be replaced in part\r\nor entirely by bone.\r\n\r\nThe =proximal extremity= is the major part of the bone. It projects\r\nupward and somewhat backward behind the lower end of the humerus, and\r\nforms a lever arm for the extensor muscles of the elbow. The =internal\r\nsurface= is concave and smooth. The =external surface= is convex and is\r\nroughened above. The =anterior border= bears on its middle a pointed\r\nprojection, the =processus anconæus= or “beak,” which overhangs the\r\n=semilunar notch= or =sigmoid cavity= (Incisura semilunaris). The latter\r\nis triangular in outline, concave from above downward, and articulates\r\nwith the humerus; in the middle of its lower part is an extensive\r\nsynovial fossa. Just below the notch are two convex =facets= which\r\narticulate with those on the posterior aspect of the proximal end of the\r\nradius. The =posterior border= is nearly straight, and is thick and\r\nrounded. The free end or summit is a rough tuberosity, the =olecranon=,\r\nwhich gives attachment to the triceps brachii and other muscles.\r\n\r\nThe primitive =distal extremity= has, as previously stated, fused with\r\nthe radius.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The ulna ossifies from three centers, of which one is for\r\nthe main part of the bone, one for the olecranon, and one for the distal\r\nend. The cartilaginous embryonic ulna extends the entire length of the\r\nforearm. The lower part of the shaft is usually reduced to a small\r\nfibrous band or may disappear entirely; in some cases a variable remnant\r\nof it ossifies. The distal extremity fuses early with the radius. The\r\nolecranon unites with the rest of the bone at three to three and a half\r\nyears. A medullary canal appears to occur constantly in the\r\nadult—contrary to the statements of some authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE CARPUS\r\n\r\nThe =carpus= of the horse consists of seven or eight bones (Ossa carpi)\r\narranged in two rows, proximal or antibrachial, and distal or\r\nmetacarpal. The (abbreviated) names and relative positions of the bones\r\nof the left carpus as seen from in front are indicated below.\r\n\r\n                            _Proximal Row:_\r\n                  Radial Intermediate Ulnar Accessory\r\n\r\n                             _Distal Row:_\r\n                  First  Second       Third Fourth\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE RADIAL CARPAL BONE\r\n\r\nThe =radial carpal= bone (Os carpi radiale, scaphoid) is the largest\r\nbone of the upper row; it is somewhat compressed laterally, and is\r\nclearly six-sided. The =superior= or =proximal surface= is convex in\r\nfront, concave behind, and articulates with the inner facet on the\r\ndistal end of the radius. The =inferior= or =distal surface= is also\r\nconvex in front and concave behind; it articulates with the second and\r\nthird carpal bones. The =external surface= bears upper and lower facets\r\non its anterior part for articulation with the intermediate; between and\r\nbehind these it is excavated and rough. The =anterior= or =dorsal\r\nsurface= is rough and slightly convex. The =internal surface= and the\r\n=posterior= or =volar surface= are rough and tuberculate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 51.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF UPPER PART OF RADIUS AND ULNA OF HORSE.\r\n    _Cm_, Medullary cavity of ulna.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE INTERMEDIATE CARPAL BONE\r\n\r\nThe =intermediate carpal= bone (Os carpi intermedium, semilunar, lunar)\r\nis somewhat wedge-shaped, wider in front than behind. The =superior= or\r\n=proximal surface= is saddle-shaped, and articulates with the middle\r\nfacet on the distal end of the radius. The =inferior= or =distal\r\nsurface= is smaller, convex in front, concave behind, and articulates\r\nwith the third and fourth carpal bones. The =internal surface= has upper\r\nand lower facets for articulation with the radial carpal, and between\r\nthese it is excavated and rough. The =external surface= is similar to\r\nthe preceding and articulates with the ulnar carpal. The =anterior= or\r\n=dorsal surface= is rough and slightly convex.

The =superior= or =proximal\r\nsurface= is concave, and fits the lower part of the outer facet on the\r\ndistal end of the radius. The =inferior= or =distal surface= is oblique\r\nand undulating for articulation with the fourth carpal bone. The\r\n=internal surface= has upper and lower facets for articulation with the\r\nintermediate. The =anterior= or =dorsal= and =external surfaces= are\r\ncontinuous, convex, and rough.

It is discoid and presents for description two surfaces and a\r\ncircumference. The =internal surface= is concave and forms the outer\r\nwall of the carpal groove. The =external surface= is convex and rough; a\r\nsmooth groove for the outer tendon of the flexor carpi externus crosses\r\nits anterior part obliquely downward and slightly forward. The =anterior\r\nborder= bears two facets; the upper one is concave and articulates with\r\nthe back of the outer facet on the distal end of the radius; the lower\r\none is convex and articulates with the ulnar carpal bone. The remainder\r\nof the circumference is rounded and rough.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The accessory does not directly bear weight, and may be regarded as a\r\n  sesamoid bone interposed in the course of the tendons of the middle\r\n  and external flexors of the carpus, which it enables to act at a\r\n  mechanical advantage. The posterior border furnishes attachment to the\r\n  transverse carpal ligament, which completes the carpal canal for the\r\n  flexors of the digit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE FIRST CARPAL BONE\r\n\r\nThe =first carpal= bone (Os carpale primum, trapezium) is a small\r\ninconstant bone, commonly about the size and shape of a pea, which is\r\nsituated in the lower part of the internal lateral ligament behind the\r\nsecond carpal bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This bone appears to be absent on both sides in about half of the\r\n  cases; in a good many subjects it is present on one side only. In size\r\n  it varies from a minute nodule to a discoid mass 10 to 12 mm. in\r\n  length. In exceptional cases it articulates with both the second\r\n  carpal and the second (inner) metacarpal bone, in other cases with the\r\n  former only, but in the majority of specimens no articular facet is\r\n  present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SECOND CARPAL BONE\r\n\r\nThe =second carpal= bone (Os carpale secundum, trapezoid) is the\r\nsmallest constant bone of the lower row, and is irregularly\r\nhemispherical in shape. The =superior= or =proximal surface= is a convex\r\nfacet which is continued upon the =posterior= or =volar surface= and\r\narticulates with the posterior part of the radial carpal. The =external\r\nsurface= faces obliquely outward and forward, and bears three facets for\r\narticulation with the third carpal bone. The =anterior= or =dorsal= and\r\nthe =internal surface= bear a tuberosity to which the lateral ligament\r\nis attached. The =inferior= or =distal surface= is articular and\r\nconsists of a large flattened facet for the inner (second) metacarpal\r\nbone, and a small one for the large (third) metacarpal bone. Some\r\nspecimens have a small facet on the lower part of the posterior surface\r\nwhich articulates with the first carpal bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 54.—CARPAL BONES OF HORSE, WITH ADJACENT ENDS OF RADIUS AND\r\n    METACARPUS; ANTERIOR VIEW.

It is flattened from above downward, and is twice as wide\r\nin front as behind. The =superior= or =proximal surface= consists of two\r\nfacets separated by an antero-posterior ridge; the inner facet is\r\nconcave and articulates with the radial carpal; the outer facet—for the\r\nintermediate carpal—is concave in front and convex behind, where it\r\nencroaches on the posterior surface. The =inferior= or =distal surface=\r\nis slightly undulating, and articulates almost entirely with the large\r\n(third) metacarpal bone, but it usually bears a small oblique facet at\r\nits inner side for the inner (second) metacarpal, and there is commonly\r\na non-articular depression externally. The _internal surface_ faces\r\nbackward and inward, and bears three facets for articulation with the\r\nsecond carpal, between which it is excavated and rough. The =external\r\nsurface= has two facets for articulation with the fourth carpal, and is\r\ndepressed and rough in its middle. The =anterior= or =dorsal surface= is\r\nconvex and is crossed by a rough transverse ridge. The =posterior= or\r\n=volar surface= is relatively small, and is rounded; its upper part is\r\nencroached upon by the superior articular surface, below which it is\r\nrough.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE FOURTH CARPAL BONE\r\n\r\nThe =fourth carpal= bone (Os carpale quartum, unciform) is somewhat\r\nwedge-shaped, and is readily distinguished from the second by its\r\ngreater size and its posterior tubercle. The =superior= or =proximal\r\nsurface= articulates with the intermediate and ulnar; it is convex and\r\ncurves outward, backward, and downward, encroaching on the external and\r\nposterior surfaces. The =inferior= or =distal surface= bears two inner\r\nfacets for the large (third) metacarpal and an outer one for the\r\nexternal (fourth) metacarpal bone. The =internal surface= has two or\r\nthree facets for articulation with the third carpal, between which it is\r\nexcavated and rough. The =anterior= or =dorsal surface= is convex and\r\nrough. The =external surface= is small, being encroached upon by the\r\nsuperior articular surface. The =posterior= or =volar surface= bears a\r\ntubercle on its lower part.[21]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE CARPUS AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\nThe bones of the carpus, exclusive of the accessory, form an irregular\r\nquadrangular mass, the width of which is about twice the height or the\r\nantero-posterior diameter. The =anterior= or =dorsal surface= is convex\r\nfrom side to side, depressed along the line of junction of the two rows,\r\nand prominent below. The =posterior= or =volar surface= is in general\r\nslightly convex, but very irregular. It forms with the accessory the\r\n=carpal groove= (Sulcus carpi), which in the recent state is rendered\r\nsmooth by the posterior ligament; it is converted into the =carpal\r\ncanal= (Canalis carpi) for the flexor tendons by the transverse carpal\r\nligament, which stretches across from the accessory bone to the inner\r\nside. The =proximal surface= is widest internally and is elevated in\r\nfront, concave behind; it is entirely articular and adapted to the\r\ncarpal articular surface of the radius. The =distal surface= is also\r\narticular and is irregularly faceted in adaptation to the surfaces of\r\nthe metacarpal bones; each of the lower bones usually articulates with\r\ntwo metacarpal bones, but sometimes the third does not bear on the inner\r\nmetacarpal bone. The =lateral surfaces= are both irregular and rough,\r\nthe internal one being the wider. With the exception of the accessory,\r\nulnar, and second, each bone articulates with two bones of the other\r\nrow.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—Each ossifies from a single center.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE METACARPUS\r\n\r\nThree =metacarpal bones= (Ossa metacarpalia) are present in the horse.\r\nOf these, only one, the third or large metacarpal bone, is fully\r\ndeveloped and carries a digit; the other two, the second and fourth, are\r\nmuch reduced, and are commonly called the internal and external small\r\nmetacarpal or “splint” bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 56.—DISTAL ROW OF CARPAL BONES, METACARPUS, FIRST AND SECOND\r\n    PHALANGES, AND PROXIMAL SESAMOID BONES OF HORSE; POSTERIOR VIEW,\r\n    LEFT SIDE.\r\n\r\n  The fourth (external) metacarpal bone is wrongly numbered as I.

Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE LARGE METACARPAL BONE\r\n\r\nThis (Os metacarpale tertium) is a very strong long bone, placed\r\nvertically between the carpus above and the first phalanx below. It\r\nconsists of a shaft and two extremities.\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= (Corpus) is semicylindrical, and presents two surfaces and\r\ntwo borders. The =anterior= or =dorsal surface= is smooth, convex from\r\nside to side, and nearly straight in its length. The =posterior= or\r\n=volar surface= is somewhat convex from side to side and, with the small\r\nbones, forms a wide groove which lodges the suspensory ligament. On\r\neither side of its upper two-thirds it is roughened for the attachment\r\nof the small metacarpal bones. The =nutrient foramen= occurs at the\r\njunction of the upper and middle thirds. The lower third is wider and\r\nflattened. The borders are rounded.\r\n\r\nThe =proximal extremity= (Basis) bears an undulating articular surface\r\nadapted to the lower row of carpal bones. The greater part supports the\r\nthird carpal bone; the oblique outer part, separated from the preceding\r\nby a ridge, articulates with the fourth, and a small facet for the\r\nsecond is usually found at the postero-internal angle. On either side is\r\na notch separating two small facets which articulate with the proximal\r\nends of the small metacarpal bones. Toward the inner side of the\r\nanterior surface is the =metacarpal tuberosity=, into which the extensor\r\ncarpi radialis is inserted. The posterior surface is roughened for the\r\nattachment of the suspensory ligament.\r\n\r\nThe =distal extremity= (Trochlea s. Capitulum) presents an articular\r\nsurface for the first phalanx and the proximal sesamoid bones, which is\r\ncomposed of two condyles, separated by a sagittal ridge; the inner\r\ncondyle is slightly the larger. On either side is a small fossa,\r\nsurmounted by a tubercle, for the attachment of the lateral ligaments of\r\nthe fetlock joint.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The large metacarpal is one of the strongest bones in the skeleton.\r\n  The compact substance is specially thick in front and internally. The\r\n  medullary canal extends further toward the ends than in most of the\r\n  long bones of the horse and there is little spongy bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE SMALL METACARPAL BONES\r\n\r\nThese are situated on either side of the posterior surface of the large\r\nmetacarpal bone, and form the sides of the metacarpal groove. Each\r\nconsists of a shaft and two extremities.\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= (Corpus) is three-sided and tapers to the distal end. It is\r\nvariably curved, convex toward the middle line of the limb. The anterior\r\nsurface is flattened and is rough, except in its lower part; it is\r\nattached to the large metacarpal bone by an interosseous ligament,\r\nexcept near the distal end. The abaxial surface is smooth and rounded\r\nfrom side to side above, grooved below. The axial surface is smooth and\r\nconcave from edge to edge, except below, where it forms a rounded edge.\r\n\r\nThe =proximal extremity= or =head= (Basis) is relatively large. In the\r\ncase of the inner bone it usually bears two facets above which support\r\nthe second and third carpal bones, while the outer bone has here a\r\nsingle facet for articulation with the fourth carpal bone. Each has also\r\ntwo facets for articulation with the large metacarpal, and is elsewhere\r\nroughened for the attachment of ligaments and muscles. The inner bone\r\nmay present a small facet behind for the first carpal bone.\r\n\r\nThe =distal extremity= (Capitulum) is usually a small nodule, which\r\nprojects to a variable extent in different subjects, and is easily felt\r\nin the living animal. It is situated two-thirds to three-fourths of the\r\nway down the region.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The small metacarpal bones vary much in length, thickness, and\r\n  curvature. In the majority of cases the inner bone is the longer; in\r\n  other subjects the outer one is the longer or there is no material\r\n  difference. Sometimes the curvature is very pronounced, so that the\r\n  distal end causes a decided projection. The distal end is very\r\n  variable in size and may be a mere point.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The large metacarpal bone ossifies from three centers.\r\nThe proximal extremity unites with the shaft before birth, the distal\r\nextremity toward the middle of the second year. The small metacarpal\r\nbones ossify from two centers, one of which is for the proximal\r\nextremity. Their distal ends are cartilaginous at birth. Fusion of the\r\nmiddle part of the shaft with the large metacarpal bone is common.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE PHALANGES\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FIRST PHALANX\r\n\r\nThe _first phalanx_ (Phalanx prima)[22] is a long bone, situated between\r\nthe large metacarpal bone above and the second phalanx below. It is\r\ndirected obliquely downward and forward, forming an angle of 50 to 55\r\ndegrees with the horizontal plane in well-formed limbs. It consists of a\r\nshaft and two extremities.\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= (Corpus) is wider and much thicker above than below, and\r\npresents two surfaces and two borders. The =anterior= or =dorsal\r\nsurface= is convex from side to side and smooth. The =posterior= or\r\n=volar surface= is flattened, and bears a triangular rough area, bounded\r\nlaterally by ridges which begin at the tuberosities above and converge\r\nbelow; this area furnishes attachment to the inferior sesamoidean\r\nligaments. The =borders=, =internal= and =external=, are rounded and\r\nhave a rough area or a tubercle on their middle parts.\r\n\r\nThe =proximal extremity= (Basis) is relatively large. It bears an\r\narticular surface adapted to the distal end of the large metacarpal\r\nbone, consisting of two glenoid cavities separated by a sagittal groove;\r\nthe inner cavity is a little larger than the outer one. The posterior\r\nangles are formed by buttress-like tuberosities for ligamentous\r\nattachment. The anterior surface has a slight elevation for the\r\nattachment of the lateral extensor tendon.\r\n\r\nThe =distal extremity= is smaller, especially in its antero-posterior\r\ndiameter. It presents a trochlea for articulation with the second\r\nphalanx, consisting of a shallow central groove and two lateral convex\r\nareas or condyles; the inner area is a little the larger. On either\r\nside, just above the margin of the articular surface, is a depression\r\nsurmounted by a tubercle, to both of which the lateral ligament is\r\nattached. Behind the tubercle is a distinct facet to which the\r\nsuperficial flexor tendon is attached.\r\n\r\n=Development.= The first phalanx ossifies from three centers. The distal\r\nend unites with the shaft before birth, the proximal end early in the\r\nfirst year.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The first phalanx contains a small medullary canal in the middle of\r\n  the shaft. It may be remarked that the bone is twisted slightly; when\r\n  placed volar surface down on the table, it touches the latter by three\r\n  points only, the proximal tuberosities and the internal condyle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SECOND PHALANX\r\n\r\nThe =second phalanx= (Phalanx secunda)[23] is situated between the first\r\nand third phalanges, its direction corresponding to that of the first\r\nphalanx. It is flattened from before backward, and its width is greater\r\nthan its height. It may be described as possessing four surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe =upper= or =proximal surface= presents two glenoid cavities\r\nseparated by a low ridge, and articulates with the first phalanx. The\r\nmiddle of the anterior border is elevated and roughened in front for the\r\nattachment of the anterior or common extensor tendon. The posterior\r\nborder is thick and overhanging; in the fresh state its middle part is\r\ncovered with cartilage, over which the deep flexor tendon passes. On\r\neither side there is an eminence, to which the lateral ligament and the\r\nsuperficial flexor tendon are attached.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior= or =distal surface= is trochlear, and articulates with\r\nthe third phalanx and third sesamoid bone. It resembles somewhat the\r\ntrochlea of the first phalanx, but is more extensive and encroaches more\r\non the anterior and posterior surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior= or =dorsal surface= is convex from side to side and\r\nsmooth in its middle; on its lower part are lateral rough depressions,\r\nsurmounted by tuberosities, to both of which ligaments are attached.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =volar= surface is smooth, flattened, and slopes\r\nobliquely downward and forward. The borders which separate the anterior\r\nand posterior surfaces are concave from above downward, rounded from\r\nbefore backward.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The second phalanx ossifies like the first, but the\r\nproximal end unites with the shaft two or three months earlier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58.—PHALANGES AND THIRD SESAMOID OF HORSE, DORSAL ASPECT.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE THIRD PHALANX\r\n\r\nThe =third= or =ungual phalanx= (Phalanx tertia)[24] is entirely\r\ninclosed by the hoof, to which it conforms in a general way. It presents\r\nfor examination three surfaces, three borders, and two angles or wings.\r\n\r\nThe =articular surface= (Facies articularis) faces upward and backward,\r\nand is chiefly adapted to the distal surface of the second phalanx, but\r\na narrow flattened area along the posterior border articulates with the\r\nthird sesamoid. The =anterior= or =coronary border= forms a central\r\neminence, the =extensor= (or pyramidal) =process= (Processus\r\nextensorius), to the front of which the anterior extensor tendon is\r\nattached. On either side is a depression for the attachment of the\r\nlateral ligament.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal= or =wall surface= (Facies dorsalis) slopes downward and\r\nforward. The angle of inclination on the ground plane is about 45 to 50\r\ndegrees in front. Laterally the height diminishes, and the slope becomes\r\nsteeper, especially on the inner side. From side to side the curvature\r\nis almost semicircular. The surface is rough and porous, resembling\r\npumice stone somewhat. It is perforated by numerous foramina of various\r\nsizes; a series of larger ones is situated on or near the lower border.\r\nOn either side the =dorsal= (or preplantar) =groove= (Sulcus dorsalis)\r\npasses forward from the wing and ends at one of the larger foramina. In\r\nthe fresh state this surface is covered by the matrix of the wall of the\r\nhoof. The =inferior= or =distal border= is thin, sharp, and irregularly\r\nnotched; there is commonly a wider notch in front.\r\n\r\nThe =volar= or =inferior surface= (Facies volaris) is arched, and\r\ndivided into two unequal parts by a curved rough line, the =semilunar\r\ncrest= (Crista semilunaris). The larger anterior area is\r\ncrescent-shaped, concave, and comparatively smooth; it corresponds to\r\nthe sole of the hoof, and may be termed the =sole surface=. The\r\nposterior part is much smaller, and is semilunar; it is related to the\r\ndeep flexor tendon, and is hence called the =flexor= or =tendon surface=\r\n(Facies flexoria). It presents a central prominent rough area, on either\r\nside of which is the =volar= (or plantar) =foramen= (Foramen volare), to\r\nwhich the =volar= (or plantar) =groove= (Sulcus volaris) conducts from\r\nthe wing. The foramina lead into the =semilunar canal= within the bone,\r\nfrom which small canals lead to some of the foramina of the wall\r\nsurface. The deep flexor tendon is inserted into the semilunar crest and\r\nthe central rough area behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The volar grooves and foramina transmit the terminations of the\r\n  digital arteries into the semilunar canal, where they meet and form a\r\n  terminal arch, from which branches pass through canals in the bone and\r\n  emerge through the foramina on the wall surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =angles= or =wings= (Anguli) are prismatic masses which project\r\nbackward on either side; the inner one is usually the shorter. Each is\r\ndivided into upper and lower parts by a notch, or is perforated by a\r\nforamen which leads to the vascular groove on the side of the wall\r\nsurface.[25] The upper border carries the lateral cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral cartilages= (Cartilagines ungulæ) are rhomboid curved\r\nplates, which surmount the wings on either side. They are relatively\r\nlarge and extend above the margin of the hoof sufficiently to be\r\ndistinctly palpable. The abaxial surface is convex, the axial concave.\r\nThe upper border is convex and thin; the lower is thicker and is in part\r\nattached to the wing. The anterior end is attached by ligament to the\r\nside of the second phalanx. The posterior end curves toward its fellow\r\nat the heel, and is perforated by numerous foramina for the passage of\r\nveins. The central part is mainly hyaline, the periphery mainly fibrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It will be noted that the size and form of the wings vary much in\r\n  different specimens. In the new-born foal the wing is a small, pointed\r\n  projection. Later the process of ossification invades the lower part\r\n  of the cartilage to a varying extent. In some cases the greater part\r\n  of the cartilage is ossified—a condition commonly termed “sidebone.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The ossification of the terminal phalanx is peculiar.\r\nWhile the proximal articular part is still cartilaginous, a\r\nperichondrial cap of bone is formed in relation to the hoof. Later the\r\nprocess extends into the upper part.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The interior of this bone is channeled by numerous canals\r\nfor vessels, most of which radiate from the semilunar canal to the wall\r\nsurface; these are not canals for nutrient vessels of the bone, but\r\ntransmit arteries to the matrix of the hoof. Thick layers of compact\r\nsubstance are found at the articular and flexor surfaces and the\r\nextensor process, _i. e._, at the points of greatest pressure and\r\ntraction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SESAMOID BONES\r\n\r\nThe two =proximal= or =great sesamoids= (Ossa sesamoidea phalangis\r\nprimæ) are situated behind the distal end of the large metacarpal bone,\r\nand are closely attached to the first phalanx by strong ligaments. Each\r\nhas the form of a three-sided pyramid. The =anterior= or =articular\r\nsurface= conforms to the corresponding part of the distal end of the\r\nlarge metacarpal bone. The =posterior= or =flexor surface= is flattened\r\nand oblique; in the fresh state it is covered by a layer of cartilage\r\nwhich also fills the interval between the opposed borders of the two\r\nbones, and forms a smooth groove for the deep flexor tendon. The\r\n=abaxial surface= is concave, and gives attachment to part of the\r\nsuspensory ligament; it is separated from the posterior surface by a\r\nrough everted border. The =base= faces downward, and furnishes\r\nattachment to the inferior sesamoidean ligaments. The =apex= is directed\r\nupward and is rounded.\r\n\r\nThe =third sesamoid= or =navicular= bone (Os sesamoideum phalangis\r\ntertiæ) is shuttle-shaped, and is situated behind the junction of the\r\nsecond and third phalanges. Its long axis is transverse, and it\r\npossesses two surfaces, two borders, and two extremities. The =articular\r\nsurface= (Facies articularis) faces upward and forward; it consists of a\r\ncentral eminence, flanked by concave areas, and articulates with the\r\ndistal end of the second phalanx. The =flexor= or =tendon surface=\r\n(Facies flexoria) is directed downward and backward. It resembles the\r\narticular surface in form, but is more extensive and not so smooth. In\r\nthe fresh state it is coated with cartilage and the deep flexor tendon\r\nplays over it. The =proximal border= (Margo liber) is wide and grooved\r\nin its middle, narrower and rounded on either side. The =distal border=\r\n(Margo ligamenti) bears in front a narrow facet for articulation with\r\nthe third phalanx. Behind this is a groove, which contains a number of\r\nrelatively large foramina, and is bounded behind by a prominent edge.\r\nThe =extremities= are blunt-pointed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 59.—THIRD SESAMOID OR NAVICULAR BONE OF HORSE.

It consists primarily of\r\nthree parts, the =ilium=, =ischium=, and =pubis=, which meet to form the\r\n=acetabulum=, a large cotyloid cavity for articulation with the head of\r\nthe femur. These parts are fused at about one year of age, but it is\r\nconvenient to describe them separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE ILIUM\r\n\r\nThe =ilium= (Os ilium) is the largest of the three parts. It is\r\nirregularly triangular and presents two surfaces, three borders, and\r\nthree angles.\r\n\r\nThe =gluteal surface= (Facies glutæa) faces upward, backward, and\r\noutward. It is wide and concave in front, narrower and convex behind.\r\nThe wide part is crossed by the curved =gluteal line= (Linea glutæa),\r\nwhich extends from the middle of the inner border toward the external\r\nangle. This surface gives attachment to the middle and deep gluteal\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 60.—OSSA COXARUM OF MARE, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _O.il._, Ilium; _O.p._, pubis; _O.is._, ischium; _A.o.i._, wing of\r\n    ilium; _C.o.i._, shaft of ilium; _Cr.o.i._, anterior border (crest)\r\n    of ilium; _1_, obturator foramen; _2_, acetabulum; _3_, internal\r\n    angle of ilium; _4_, external angle of ilium; _5_, gluteal line;\r\n    _6_, psoas tubercle; _7_, _8_, acetabular and symphyseal branches of\r\n    pubis; _9_, _10_, acetabular and symphyseal branches of ischium;\r\n    _12_, lesser sciatic notch; _13_, ischial arch; _14_, great sciatic\r\n    notch; _15_, symphysis pelvis; _17_, ilio-pectineal eminence; _18_,\r\n    anterior borders of pubic bones; _19_, posterior gluteal line.\r\n    (Struska, Anat. d.

The inner triangular\r\npart (Pars articularis) is roughened for ligamentous attachment, and\r\nbears an irregular facet, the =auricular surface= (Facies auricularis),\r\nfor articulation with the sacrum. The outer quadrilateral part (Pars\r\niliaca) is in general smooth. It is crossed by the =ilio-pectineal line=\r\n(Crista iliopectinea), which begins below the auricular surface and is\r\ncontinued on the shaft of the bone to join the anterior border of the\r\npubis. The line is interrupted by furrows for the iliaco-femoral\r\nvessels, and below these it bears the =psoas tubercle= (Tuberculum\r\npsoadicum), which gives attachment to the psoas minor muscle. The\r\niliacus muscle is attached to the surface external to the ilio-pectineal\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior border= or =crest= (Crista iliaca) is concave, thick, and\r\nrough.\r\n\r\nThe =internal border= is deeply concave; its middle part forms the lower\r\nboundary of the =great sciatic foramen=, and it is continuous behind\r\nwith the =superior ischiatic spine=.\r\n\r\nThe =external border= is concave and in great part rough. Its fore part\r\nis crossed by grooves for the ilio-lumbar vessels, which are continued\r\non the pelvic surface.

(Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d.

It is somewhat thickened and rough.\r\n\r\nThe =external= or =coxal angle= (Tuber coxæ) forms the basis of the\r\npoint of the hip. It is a large quadrangular mass, narrow in its middle,\r\nand enlarged at either end, where it bears a pair of tuberosities. It is\r\nroughened for muscular attachment.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =acetabular angle= meets the other two bones at the\r\nacetabulum, of which it forms about two-fifths. Its prominent upper\r\nborder forms part of the =superior ischiatic spine=, which is roughened\r\nexternally, smooth internally. Two depressions above and in front of the\r\nacetabulum give attachment to the tendons of origin of the rectus\r\nfemoris muscle. This angle is connected with the ala or wide part of the\r\nbone by a constricted part, often termed the =shaft=. The latter is of\r\nthree-sided prismatic form. Its external surface is convex and rough,\r\nand gives attachment to the deep gluteus muscle. Its pelvic surface is\r\nsmooth and is grooved for the obturator vessels and nerves. Its ventral\r\nsurface is crossed by vascular grooves, below which is a rough area,\r\nbounded internally by the psoas tubercle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE ISCHIUM\r\n\r\nThe =ischium= (Os ischii) forms the posterior part of the ventral wall\r\nor floor of the bony pelvis. It slopes a little downward and inward, but\r\nis practically horizontal in the longitudinal direction. It is\r\nirregularly quadrilateral, and may be described as having two surfaces,\r\nfour borders, and four angles.\r\n\r\nThe =superior= or =pelvic surface= (Facies pelvina) is smooth and\r\nslightly concave from side to side.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior surface= (Facies externa) is nearly flat, and is in great\r\npart roughened for the attachment of the adductor muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior border= forms the posterior margin of the obturator\r\nforamen.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior border= is thick and rough. It slopes obliquely inward\r\nand forward to meet the border of the other side, forming with it the\r\n=ischial arch= (Arcus ischiadicus).\r\n\r\nThe =internal border= meets the opposite bone at the symphysis.\r\n\r\nThe =external border= is thick and rounded, but concave in =its length=;\r\nit forms the =lesser sciatic notch=, the lower boundary of the lesser\r\nsciatic foramen.\r\n\r\nThe =antero-internal angle= or =symphyseal branch= (Ramus symphyseos)\r\nmeets the pubis, with which it forms the inner boundary of the obturator\r\nforamen.\r\n\r\nThe =antero-external angle= or =acetabular branch= joins the other two\r\nbones at the acetabulum, of which it forms more than half. Superiorly it\r\nbears part of the =superior ischiatic spine= (Spina ischiadica), and\r\ninternally it is grooved for the obturator vessels.\r\n\r\nThe =postero-external angle= is a thick three-sided mass, the =tuber\r\nischii= (Tuber ischiadicum); its lower border is the =inferior ischiatic\r\nspine=, to which the biceps femoris and semitendinosus muscles are\r\nattached.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE PUBIS\r\n\r\nThe =pubis= (Os pubis) is the smallest of the three parts of the os\r\ncoxæ. It forms the anterior part of the pelvic floor, and may be\r\ndescribed as having two surfaces, three borders, and three angles.\r\n\r\nThe =superior= or =pelvic surface= (Facies pelvina) is convex in the\r\nyoung subject and the stallion, concave and smooth in the mare and\r\nusually in the gelding also. The urinary bladder rests on it.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior= or =ventral surface= (Facies externa) is convex, and in\r\ngreat part rough for muscular attachment. Near the anterior border it is\r\ncrossed by the =subpubic groove=, the inner part of which is occupied by\r\na large vein, the outer part by the pubo-femoral ligament.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior border= is thin in its inner part (except in the young\r\nsubject and the stallion), forming the pecten ossis pubis. Externally it\r\nbears the rough =ilio-pectineal eminence= (Eminentia iliopectinea),\r\nbeyond which it is continuous with the ilio-pectineal line.\r\n\r\nThe =internal border= joins the opposite bone at the symphysis pubis.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior border= forms the anterior margin of the obturator\r\nforamen, and is marked externally by the obturator groove.\r\n\r\nThe =internal angle= meets its fellow at the anterior end of the\r\nsymphysis. This part is very thick in the young subject and the\r\nstallion, but in the mare, and usually in the gelding also, it becomes\r\nthin with advancing age.\r\n\r\nThe =external= or =acetabular angle= joins the ilium and ischium at the\r\nacetabulum.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior angle= joins the ischium, with which it forms the inner\r\nboundary of the obturator foramen.\r\n\r\nThe =pubis= may conveniently be regarded as consisting of two branches\r\nwhich meet at a right angle; these are termed the =transverse= or\r\n=acetabular branch= (Ramus acetabularis) and the =longitudinal= or\r\n=symphyseal branch= (Ramus symphysecs).\r\n\r\nThe =acetabulum= is a cotyloid cavity which lodges the head of the\r\nfemur. It faces downward and outward, and consists of an articular and a\r\nnon-articular part. The =articular part= (Facies lunata) is crescentic,\r\nand is cut into internally by the non-articular part, which lies at a\r\nlower level, and is termed the =acetabular fossa= (Fossa acetabuli). The\r\ninner part of the rim is correspondingly cut into by the =acetabular\r\nnotch= (Incisura acetabuli), which is converted into a foramen by the\r\ntransverse ligament in the fresh state, and transmits the pubo-femoral\r\nand round ligaments to the head of the femur.\r\n\r\nThe =obturator foramen= (Foramen obturatum) is situated between the\r\npubis and ischium. It is oval in outline, the longer axis being directed\r\nforward and outward. Its margin is grooved antero-externally for the\r\nobturator nerve and vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 62.—OSSA COXARUM OF STALLION, DORSAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Development.=—Each division of the os coxæ ossifies from one chief\r\ncenter. The center for the ilium appears first near the acetabulum,\r\nfollowed quickly by one for the ischium, and a little later by the pubic\r\ncenter. Secondary centers appear for the crest and external angle of the\r\nilium, the tuber and posterior border of the ischium, and the acetabular\r\npart of the pubis. The pubis and ischium are united at birth or soon\r\nafter, but are not fused with the ilium until the second year. The\r\nepiphyseal parts fuse with the main mass at four and a half to five\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The acetabular part of the pubis ossifies from a separate center. It\r\n  is most distinct in the embryo at three months, and is often called\r\n  the os acetabuli. Martin says that the ilium has a center for the\r\n  acetabular part, one for the shaft and wing, and a third for the\r\n  crest. He also states that there is a special center for the\r\n  acetabular part of the ischium, and a transitory nucleus in the\r\n  symphyseal part of the pubis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE PELVIS\r\n\r\nThe =bony pelvis= is composed of the ossa coxarum, the sacrum, and the\r\nfirst three coccygeal vertebræ. The =dorsal wall= or =roof= is formed by\r\nthe sacrum and first three coccygeal vertebræ, and the =ventral wall= or\r\n=floor= by the pubic and ischial bones. The =lateral walls= are formed\r\nby the ilia and the acetabular part of the ischia. The defect in the\r\nskeleton here is supplied in the fresh state by the sacro-sciatic\r\nligaments and semimembranosus muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior aperture= or =inlet= (Apertura pelvis cranialis) is\r\nbounded by the =terminal line= (Linea terminalis) or brim, composed of\r\nthe base of the sacrum dorsally, the ilio-pectineal lines laterally, and\r\nthe anterior border of the pubis ventrally. It is almost circular in the\r\nmare, semi-elliptical in the stallion, and faces obliquely downward and\r\nforward. It has two principal diameters. Of these, the =conjugate= or\r\n=sacro-pubic diameter= (Conjugata) is measured from the sacral\r\npromontory to the anterior end of the symphysis. The =transverse\r\ndiameter= (Diameter transversa) is measured at the greatest width, _i.\r\ne._, just above the psoas tubercle.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior aperture= or =outlet= (Apertura pelvis caudalis) is much\r\nsmaller and is very incomplete in the skeleton. It is bounded above by\r\nthe third coccygeal vertebra and below by the ischial arch; in the fresh\r\nstate it is completed laterally by the sacro-sciatic ligament and the\r\nsemimembranosus muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =axis= of the pelvis is an imaginary line drawn through the centers\r\nof the inlet, cavity, and outlet.\r\n\r\n=Sexual Differences.=—Marked differences exist in the size and form of\r\nthe pelvis in the two sexes. The average =conjugate diameter= is about\r\n9½ inches (ca. 23 to 24 cm.) in the mare, 7½ inches (ca. 18 to 20 cm.)\r\nin the stallion. The =transverse diameter= of the inlet averages about 9\r\ninches (ca. 22 to 23 cm.) in the mare, and 8 inches (ca. 20 cm.) in the\r\nstallion. The =obliquity= of the inlet is greater in the female; the\r\ndifference is indicated by the fact that a vertical plane from the\r\npecten cuts the fourth sacral segment in the female, the second in the\r\nmale. The =outlet= is also larger in the mare, the =ischial arch= being\r\nabout one-third wider than in the stallion. The =cavity= is much more\r\nroomy in the female; the transverse diameter between the middles of the\r\nsuperior ischiatic spines is about 8 inches (20 cm.) in the mare, 6\r\ninches (15 cm.) in the stallion. The pubic part of the =floor= in the\r\nfemale is concave and lies considerably lower than the ischiatic part,\r\nwhich is wide and relatively flat. In the stallion the pubis is very\r\nthick centrally, and this part of the floor is convex, while the ischial\r\npart is relatively narrow, and is concave from side to side. The\r\n=obturator foramina= are correspondingly larger in the female. The ilium\r\nis shorter, and the greater sciatic notch deeper and narrower in the\r\nmale. The pelvis of the gelding, when castration has been performed\r\nearly, resembles that of the mare; otherwise the male characters appear\r\nto be retained to a large degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE FEMUR\r\n\r\nThe =femur= or thigh bone (Os femoris) is the largest and most massive\r\nof the long bones. It extends obliquely downward and forward,\r\narticulating with the acetabulum above and the tibia and patella below.\r\nIt presents for examination a shaft and two extremities.\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= or =body= (Corpus femoris) is in general cylindrical, but\r\nflattened behind, and larger above than below. The =anterior= and\r\n=lateral surfaces= are continuous and strongly convex from side to side;\r\nthere is often a central vertical rough line on the proximal part, but\r\notherwise these surfaces are smooth. They are covered by the quadriceps\r\nfemoris muscle. The =posterior surface= is wide, flat, and smooth in its\r\nproximal fourth. Below this part there is a rough elevation externally\r\nfor the attachment of the femoral tendon of the biceps femoris, and a\r\nrough line internally to which the quadratus femoris is attached. The\r\nmiddle third is narrower, and is rough for the attachment of the\r\nadductor muscle. Just below this area an oblique groove crosses the\r\nsurface, indicating the position of the femoral vessels. The =internal\r\nborder= bears on its proximal part the =internal trochanter= or\r\n=trochanter minor=, a thick rough ridge, to which the ilio-psoas muscle\r\nis attached. From this a rough line curves up to the front of the neck\r\nand indicates the limit of the attachment of the vastus internus muscle.\r\nA narrow rough area about the middle gives attachment to the pectineus\r\nmuscle, and the =nutrient foramen= is usually found just in front of\r\nthis mark. The =supracondyloid crest= is situated below the groove for\r\nthe femoral vessels, and gives origin to the inner head of the\r\ngastrocnemius. The =external border= is prominent in its upper part, and\r\nbears at the junction of its proximal and middle thirds the =external=\r\nor =third trochanter= (Trochanter tertius); this process is curved\r\nforward, and furnishes insertion to the tendon of the superficial\r\ngluteus muscle. At the lower part is found the =supracondyloid= or\r\n=plantar fossa= (Fossa plantaris), in which the superficial flexor\r\narises; it is bounded externally by a thick rough margin, to which the\r\nouter head of the gastrocnemius muscle is attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 63.—RIGHT FEMUR OF HORSE, EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 64.—RIGHT FEMUR OF HORSE, POSTERIOR VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 65.—RIGHT FEMUR OF HORSE, INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Anterior part, _1′_, posterior part of trochanter major; _2_,\r\n    neck; _3_, fovea capitis; _4_, crest; _5_, trochanteric fossa; _6_,\r\n    external or third trochanter; _7_, trochanter minor; _8_, eminence\r\n    for attachment of biceps femoris; _9_, internal border; _10_,\r\n    nutrient foramen; _11_, groove for femoral vessels; _12_,\r\n    supracondyloid crest; _13_, supracondyloid fossa; _14_, trochlea;\r\n    _15_, external epicondyle; _16_, external condyle; _17_, extensor\r\n    fossa; _18_, internal condyle; _19_, internal epicondyle; _20_,\r\n    intercondyloid fossa. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =proximal extremity= (Extremitas proximalis) is large and consists\r\nof the head, neck, and great trochanter. The =head= (Caput femoris) is\r\nplaced at the inner side and is directed inward, upward, and somewhat\r\nforward. It is approximately hemispherical and articulates with the\r\nacetabulum. It is cut into internally by a deep notch, the =fovea\r\ncapitis=, in which the pubo-femoral and round ligaments are attached.\r\nThe articular surface is surrounded by a distinct margin. The =neck=\r\n(Collum femoris) is most distinct in front and internally. The =great\r\ntrochanter= (Trochanter major) is situated externally; it presents three\r\nfeatures. The =anterior part= or =convexity= is situated opposite to the\r\nhead and rises little above the level of the latter; it gives attachment\r\nto the deep gluteus muscle, and in the fresh state its outer surface is\r\ncoated with cartilage, over which a tendon of the middle gluteus passes,\r\nto be inserted into the =crest=, which is placed below and behind the\r\nconvexity. The =posterior part= or =summit= is separated from the\r\nconvexity by a notch; it is situated behind the plane of the head and\r\nrises to a much greater height. It furnishes insertion to part of the\r\nmiddle gluteus muscle. Its posterior border is continued downward as the\r\n=trochanteric ridge=, which forms the outer wall of the =trochanteric\r\nfossa=. A number of foramina are found in the concave area internal to\r\nthe convexity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 66.—FRONTAL SECTION OF LEFT FEMUR OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The figure shows that the medullary cavity is traversed for the most\r\n    part by fine bony trabeculæ.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =distal extremity= (Extremitas distalis) is large in both directions\r\nand comprises the trochlea in front and two condyles behind. The\r\n=trochlea= consists of two ridges separated by a groove, and forms an\r\nextensive surface (Facies patellaris) for articulation with the patella.\r\nIt is very unsymmetrical; the inner ridge or lip is much wider, more\r\nprominent, and extends up higher than the external one, and the two\r\nconverge below. The =condyles=, =internal= and =external= (Condylus\r\nmedialis, lateralis), are separated by the deep =intercondyloid fossa=\r\n(Fossa intercondyloidea), and articulate with the condyles of the tibia\r\nand the semilunar cartilages of the stifle joint. A ridge connects each\r\ncondyle with the lower part of the corresponding lip of the trochlea.\r\nThe intercondyloid fossa lodges the spine of the tibia and the crucial\r\nligaments of the stifle joint, which are attached here.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The condyles are obliquely placed, with their long axes directed\r\n  downward, forward, and inward. The articular surface of the external\r\n  condyle is more strongly convex from side to side than that of the\r\n  inner one, and the ridge which connects it with the trochlea is much\r\n  narrower.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =internal epicondyle= (Epicondylus medialis) is a rounded prominence\r\non the internal surface of the internal condyle, to which the internal\r\nlateral ligament and the adductor muscle are attached. The corresponding\r\n=external epicondyle= (Epicondylus lateralis) is less distinct; it\r\npresents a mark where the lateral ligament is attached, below and behind\r\nwhich there is a depression (Fossa musculi poplitei) in which the\r\npopliteus muscle arises. Between the external condyle and trochlea is\r\nthe =extensor fossa= (Fossa extensoria), in which the tendon of origin\r\nof the anterior extensor and peroneus tertius is attached.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The shaft and the distal end each ossify from one center,\r\nbut the proximal end has two centers, one of which is for the great\r\ntrochanter. The edge of the external trochanter also has a separate\r\ncenter. The proximal end fuses with the shaft at three to three and a\r\nhalf years, the distal at about three and a half years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 67.—DISTAL EXTREMITY OF RIGHT FEMUR OF HORSE, END VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE TIBIA\r\n\r\nThe =tibia= is a long bone which extends obliquely downward and backward\r\nfrom the stifle to the hock. It articulates above with the femur, below\r\nwith the tarsus, and externally with the fibula. It possesses a shaft\r\nand two extremities.\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= or =body= (Corpus tibiæ), large and three-sided above,\r\nbecomes smaller and flattened in the sagittal direction below, but\r\nwidens a little at the distal end. It presents for notice three surfaces\r\nand three borders. The =internal surface= (Facies medialis) is broad\r\nabove, where it furnishes insertion to the internal lateral ligament and\r\nthe sartorius and gracilis muscles; below this it is convex and\r\nsubcutaneous. The =external surface= (Facies lateralis) is smooth and\r\nsomewhat spiral. It is wide and concave in its upper part, below which\r\nit becomes narrower and slightly convex, and winds gradually to the\r\nfront of the bone; near the distal end it widens a little, becomes flat,\r\nand faces forward. The =posterior surface= (Facies posterior) is\r\nflattened, and is divided into two parts by the rough =popliteal line=,\r\nwhich runs obliquely from the upper part of the external border to the\r\nmiddle of the internal border. The triangular area above the line is\r\noccupied by the popliteus muscle, while the area below is marked by\r\nrough lines (Lineæ musculares) to which the deep flexor muscle of the\r\ndigit is attached; the lines fade out below, where the surface is smooth\r\nand flat. The =nutrient foramen= is situated on or near the popliteal\r\nline. The =anterior border= is very prominent in its upper third,\r\nforming the =tibial crest= (Crista tibiæ); below it is reduced to a\r\nrough line, which ends at a small elevation near the distal end of the\r\nbone. The =internal border= (Margo medialis) is rounded in its upper\r\nhalf, to which the popliteus muscle is attached, and a tubercle is found\r\non this part. The lower part is a rough line on well-marked bones. The\r\n=external border= (Crista interossea) is concave in its upper part and\r\nconcurs with the fibula in the formation of the interosseous space of\r\nthe leg; a smooth impression indicates the course of the anterior tibial\r\nvessels through the space to the front of the leg. Lower down the border\r\ndivides and incloses a narrow triangular surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 68.—RIGHT TIBIA AND FIBULA OF HORSE, EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =proximal extremity= (Extremitas proximalis) is large and\r\nthree-sided. It bears two lateral eminences, the =internal= and\r\n=external condyles= (Condylus medialis, lateralis). Each presents a\r\nsomewhat saddle-shaped surface for articulation with the condyle of the\r\nfemur and the semilunar cartilage. The =spine= or =intercondyloid\r\neminence= (Eminentia intercondyloidea) is the central prominence, upon\r\nwhich the articular surfaces are continued; it consists of a high inner\r\npart and a lower outer part (Tuberculum intercondyloideum mediale,\r\nlaterale). On, before, and behind the spine are the =anterior= and\r\n=posterior intercondyloid fossæ=, in which the anterior crucial ligament\r\nand the semilunar cartilages are attached. The condyles are separated\r\nbehind by the deep =popliteal notch= (Incisura poplitea), on the inner\r\nside of which is a tubercle for the attachment of the posterior crucial\r\nligament. The external condyle has an overhanging outer margin, below\r\nwhich is a =facet= for articulation with the fibula. The =large\r\nanterior= eminence is the =tuberosity= of the tibia (Tuberositas tibiæ).\r\nIt is marked in front by a =groove=, the lower part of which gives\r\nattachment to the middle patellar ligament, and the groove is flanked by\r\nrough areas for the attachment of the internal and external patellar\r\nligaments. A semicircular smooth =notch= (Sulcus muscularis) separates\r\nthe tuberosity from the external condyle, and gives passage to the\r\ntendon of origin of the anterior extensor and the peroneus tertius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 69.—RIGHT TIBIA AND FIBULA OF HORSE, POSTERIOR VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =distal extremity= (Extremitas distalis) is much smaller than the\r\nproximal; it is quadrangular in form and larger internally than\r\nexternally. It presents an =articular surface= (Cochlea tibiæ), which is\r\nadapted to the trochlea of the tibial tarsal bone (astragalus), and\r\nconsists of two grooves separated by a ridge. The ridge and grooves are\r\ndirected obliquely forward and outward, and are bounded laterally by the\r\n=malleoli=, to which the lateral ligaments of the hock joint are\r\nattached. The =internal malleolus= (Malleolus tibialis) is the more\r\nprominent of the two, and forms the anterior boundary of a groove for\r\nthe tendon of the inner head of the flexor perforans. The =external\r\nmalleolus= (Malleolus fibularis) is broader, and is marked by a vertical\r\ngroove for the passage of the lateral extensor tendon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 70.—RIGHT TIBIA AND FIBULA OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The tibia has the usual three chief centers of\r\nossification and supplementary ones for the tuberosity and the external\r\nmalleolus. The latter is really the distal end of the fibula; it is a\r\nseparate piece at birth, and the line of union is commonly quite evident\r\nin the adult in the external articular groove. The proximal end unites\r\nwith the shaft at about three and a half years, and the distal end at\r\nabout two years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE FIBULA\r\n\r\nThe =fibula= of the horse is a much reduced long bone, situated along\r\nthe outer side of the tibia.\r\n\r\nThe =shaft= or =body= (Corpus fibulæ) is a slender rod which forms the\r\nouter boundary of the interosseous space; it usually terminates below in\r\na pointed end about one-half to two-thirds of the way down the external\r\nborder of the tibia.\r\n\r\nThe =proximal extremity= or =head= (Capitulum fibulæ) is relatively\r\nlarge, and is flattened transversely. Its internal surface presents a\r\nnarrow area along the upper border for articulation with the tibia. The\r\nexternal surface is rough and gives attachment to the external lateral\r\nligament of the stifle joint. It has rounded anterior and posterior\r\nborders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 71.—PROXIMAL EXTREMITY OF RIGHT TIBIA OF HORSE, END VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _l.c.a._, _l.c.p._, Depressions for attachment of anterior and\r\n    posterior crucial ligaments; _l_, _m_, _m_, depressions for\r\n    attachment of semilunar cartilages.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =distal extremity= is fused with the tibia, constituting the\r\nexternal malleolus.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—This resembles that of the ulna. The embryonic\r\ncartilaginous fibula extends the entire length of the leg, but does not\r\narticulate with the femur. The lower part of the shaft is usually\r\nreduced to a fibrous band. Three centers of ossification appear, one\r\neach for the shaft and the extremities. The distal end unites early with\r\nthe tibia, forming the external malleolus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is interesting to note that in some cases the entire shaft of the\r\n  fibula develops, a reversion to the condition in the Miocene ancestors\r\n  of the present horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PATELLA\r\n\r\nThe =patella= is a large sesamoid bone which articulates with the\r\ntrochlea of the femur. It presents for description two surfaces, two\r\nborders, a base, and an apex.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior= or =free surface= (Facies libera) is irregularly\r\nquadrilateral, convex, and rough for muscular and ligamentous\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =articular surface= is smaller and is triangular in\r\noutline. It presents a vertical rounded ridge, which corresponds to the\r\ngroove on the trochlea of the femur, and separates two concave areas. Of\r\nthe latter, the inner cavity is much the larger, and is not very well\r\nadapted to the inner lip of the trochlea; in the fresh state, however,\r\nit is completed and rendered more congruent by the curved =accessory\r\nfibro-cartilage=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 72.—FRONTAL SECTION OF RIGHT TIBIA OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lateral borders= converge to the apex below, and each forms a\r\nprominence or angle at the base. The inner angle and the adjacent part\r\nof the border give attachment to the fibro-cartilage of the patella,\r\nwhich increases the articular surface. The external border is rounded\r\nand its angle is less prominent.\r\n\r\nThe =base= (Basis patellæ) faces upward and backward, and is convex\r\ntransversely, concave from before backward.\r\n\r\nThe =apex= forms a blunt point directed downward.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The patella develops as a sesamoid bone from a single\r\ncenter in a cartilaginous deposit in the tendon of the quadriceps\r\nfemoris muscle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE TARSUS\r\n\r\nThe =tarsus= or =hock= of the horse usually comprises six short bones\r\n(Ossa tarsi), but exceptionally seven are present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE TIBIAL TARSAL BONE\r\n\r\nThe =tibial tarsal= bone (Os tarsi tibiale, astragalus, or talus) is the\r\ninner bone of the proximal row. It is extremely irregular in form, but\r\nmay be considered as offering six surfaces for description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 73.—RIGHT PATELLA OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 74.—RIGHT PATELLA OF HORSE, POSTERIOR VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =superior= and the =anterior= or =dorsal surface= are continuous,\r\nand form a =trochlea= for articulation with the distal end of the tibia.\r\nThe trochlea consists of two oblique ridges with a deep groove between\r\nthem, which curve spirally forward, downward, and outward. There is\r\nusually a shallow =synovial fossa= in the groove. The =inferior surface=\r\nis convex from before backward, and most of it articulates with the\r\ncentral tarsal; externally it has an oblique facet for the fourth\r\ntarsal, and a non-articular groove cuts into the surface to its middle.\r\nThe =posterior= or =plantar surface= is oblique and extremely irregular;\r\nit presents four facets for articulation with the fibular tarsal bone;\r\nthe facets are separated by rough excavated areas, and the largest fossa\r\n(Sulcus tali) forms with a corresponding one on the fibular tarsal a\r\ncavity termed the =sinus tarsi=. The =internal surface= bears on its\r\nlower part a large tuberosity, and on its upper part a small one for the\r\nattachment of the internal lateral ligament. The =external surface= is\r\nsmaller than the internal, and is marked by a wide rough fossa in which\r\nthe external ligament is attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE FIBULAR TARSAL BONE\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 75.—RIGHT TARSUS AND UPPER PART OF METATARSUS OF HORSE, INTERNAL\r\n    VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 76.—RIGHT TARSUS AND UPPER PART OF METATARSUS OF HORSE, POSTERIOR\r\n    (PLANTAR) VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =fibular tarsal= bone (Os tarsi fibulare, calcaneum, os calcis) is\r\nthe largest bone of the hock. It is elongated, flattened from side to\r\nside, and forms a lever for the muscles which extend the hock joint. It\r\nconsists of a body and an inner process, the sustentaculum tali.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 77.—RIGHT TIBIAL TARSAL BONE OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d.

Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =body= (Corpus calcanei) is enlarged at its proximal end to form the\r\n=tuber calcis= or “point of the hock.” The posterior part of this\r\neminence gives attachment to the tendon of the gastrocnemius, while in\r\nfront and laterally it furnishes insertion to tendons of the flexor\r\nperforatus, biceps, and semitendinosus muscles. The =inferior extremity=\r\nbears a concave facet for articulation with the fourth tarsal bone. The\r\n=internal surface= has on its lower part a strong process, the\r\n=sustentaculum tali=, which projects inward. The process has a large,\r\noval, slightly concave facet in front for articulation with the tibial\r\ntarsal, and sometimes a small articular surface below for the central\r\ntarsal bone. Its plantar surface forms with the smooth inner surface of\r\nthe body a groove for the deep flexor tendon (Sulcus musculi flexoris\r\nhallucis longi). Its inner surface has a prominence on the lower part\r\nfor the attachment of the lateral ligament. The =external surface= of\r\nthe body is flattened, except below, where there is a rough prominence\r\nfor the attachment of the lateral ligament. The =anterior= or =dorsal\r\nborder= is concave in its length, smooth and rounded in its upper part.\r\nAbout its middle is a blunt-pointed projection (Processus cochlearis)\r\nwhich bears facets on its inner and lower surfaces for articulation with\r\nthe tibial tarsal bone, and is roughened outwardly for ligamentous\r\nattachment. Below this are two facets for the tibial tarsal, and an\r\nextensive rough fossa which concurs in the formation of the sinus tarsi.\r\nThe =posterior= or =plantar border= is straight and thick, and widens a\r\nlittle at either end; it is rough, and gives attachment to the long\r\nplantar ligament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 79.—RIGHT FIBULAR TARSAL BONE OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW.

It is flattened from above downward,\r\nand may be described as having two surfaces and four borders. The\r\n=superior surface= is concave from before backward, and almost all of it\r\narticulates with the tibial tarsal; a non-articular depression cuts into\r\nits outer part, and sometimes there is a facet for the fibular tarsal\r\nbone on the posterior angle. The =inferior surface= is convex, and is\r\ncrossed by a non-articular groove, which separates facets for\r\narticulation with the third and the first and second (fused) tarsals.\r\nThe =anterior= or =dorsal border= and the =internal border= are\r\ncontinuous, convex, and rough. The =posterior= or =plantar border= bears\r\ntwo prominences, separated by a notch. The =external border= is oblique,\r\nand bears anterior and posterior facets for articulation with the fourth\r\ntarsal, between which it is excavated and rough.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 84.—RIGHT TARSAL AND METATARSAL BONES OF HORSE. EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n    (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FIRST AND SECOND TARSAL BONES\r\n\r\nThe =first= and =second tarsal= bones (Os tarsale primum et secundum,\r\ncuneiform parvum) are usually fused in the horse, forming a bone of very\r\nirregular shape, situated in the inner and posterior part of the lower\r\nrow, below the central and behind the third tarsal. It is the smallest\r\nof the tarsal bones, and may be described as having two surfaces, two\r\nborders, and two extremities. The =internal surface= faces backward and\r\ninward, and is convex. Its anterior part is ridged, and gives attachment\r\nto the internal lateral ligament, and its posterior part bears an\r\nimprint where the inner tendon of the tibialis anterior is inserted. The\r\n=external surface= is marked by a deep notch which indicates the\r\ndivision between the first and second tarsal elements; it bears on its\r\nanterior part a large concave facet for the central tarsal. The\r\n=superior border= is convex. The =inferior border= is broad in front,\r\nwhere it articulates with the large and inner small metatarsal bones.\r\nThe =anterior extremity= has a small facet for articulation with the\r\nthird tarsal, and bears internally a ridge or tubercle. The =posterior\r\nextremity= is a blunt point.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases the first and second tarsal bones remain separate—a\r\n  remarkable reversion to the condition in the early ancestors of the\r\n  horse. In such specimens the first tarsal is a discoid bone,\r\n  articulating above with the central, below with the small metacarpal\r\n  bone. The second tarsal is quadrangular, equivalent to the thick\r\n  anterior part of the bone as described above, and overlapped by the\r\n  anterior part of the first tarsal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE THIRD TARSAL BONE\r\n\r\nThe =third tarsal= bone (Os tarsale tertium, third or great cuneiform)\r\nresembles the central, but is smaller and triangular in outline. It is\r\nsituated between the central above and the large metatarsal bone below.\r\nIt possesses two surfaces and three borders.\r\n\r\nThe =superior surface= is concave, and is crossed by a non-articular\r\ndepression which divides it into two unequal facets; it articulates with\r\nthe central tarsal. The =inferior surface= is slightly convex, and rests\r\non the large metatarsal bone; it has an extensive central rough\r\nexcavation. The =anterior= or =dorsal border= is convex and bears a\r\nrounded ridge on its inner part. The =internal border= is deeply notched\r\nand has a small facet for the second tarsal on its anterior part. The\r\n=external border= is also divided by a notch into two parts, and bears\r\ntwo diagonally opposite facets for articulation with the fourth tarsal.\r\nIn some cases there is a facet for the inner small metatarsal bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 85.—CROSS-SECTIONS OF METACARPAL AND METATARSAL BONES OF HORSE.\r\n    (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE FOURTH TARSAL BONE\r\n\r\nThe =fourth tarsal= bone (Os tarsale quartum, cuboid) is the outer bone\r\nof the lower row, and is equal in height to the central and third\r\ntogether. It is cuboid in shape and presents six surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe =superior surface= is convex from side to side, and articulates\r\nchiefly with the fibular tarsal, but to a small extent with the tibial\r\ntarsal also. The =inferior surface= rests on the large and external\r\nsmall metatarsal bones. The =internal surface= bears four facets for\r\narticulation with the central and third tarsal bones. It is crossed from\r\nbefore backward by a smooth groove, which by apposition with the\r\nadjacent bones forms the =canal of the tarsus= (Canalis tarsi) for the\r\npassage of the perforating tarsal vessels. The =anterior= or =dorsal=,\r\n=external=, and =posterior= or =plantar surfaces= are continuous and\r\nrough. A tuberosity behind gives attachment to the plantar ligament.\r\n\r\n=Development.=—The fibular tarsal bone has two centers of ossification,\r\none for the main mass and the other for the tuber calcis; the latter\r\nfuses with the rest of the bone at about three years of age. The first\r\nand second tarsals have separate centers, but fusion usually occurs\r\nbefore birth. Each of the other bones ossifies from a single center.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 86.—DIGITAL BONES OF FORE LIMB OF HORSE, VOLAR ASPECT.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 87.—DIGITAL BONES OF HIND LIMB OF HORSE, VOLAR ASPECT.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE METATARSUS\r\n\r\nThe =metatarsal= bones (Ossa metatarsalia), three in number, have the\r\nsame general arrangement as the metacarpal bones, but present some\r\nimportant differences. Their direction is slightly oblique, downward and\r\na little forward.\r\n\r\nThe =large= or =third metatarsal= bone is about one-sixth longer than\r\nthe corresponding metacarpal; in an animal of medium size the difference\r\nis about two inches. The shaft is more cylindrical, and is almost\r\ncircular on cross-section, except in its lower part. At the upper part\r\nof its external surface there is a groove, which is directed obliquely\r\ndownward and backward, and is continued by the furrow formed by the\r\napposition of the external metatarsal bone; it indicates the course of\r\nthe great metatarsal artery. A faint impression in a similar place on\r\nthe inner side marks the position of the corresponding vein. The\r\nnutrient foramen is relatively higher than on the metacarpal bone. The\r\nproximal extremity is much wider from before backward than that of the\r\nmetacarpal bone. Its articular surface is slightly concave, and is\r\nmarked by a large central non-articular depression, continued outward by\r\na deep notch. The greater part of the surface articulates with the third\r\ntarsal, but there is an outer facet for the fourth, and usually a small\r\nfacet posterointernally for the second tarsal bone. Posteriorly there\r\nare two pairs of facets for articulation with the small metatarsal\r\nbones. The front is crossed by a rough ridge for insertion, which\r\nbecomes larger and turns downward on the outer side behind the vascular\r\ngroove. The distal extremity closely resembles that of the corresponding\r\nmetacarpal bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases the lower part of the shaft is bent backward somewhat.\r\n  The articular surface extends a little higher behind than in the case\r\n  of the metacarpal bone. The large metatarsal bone is even more\r\n  strongly constructed than the metacarpal. The shell of compact\r\n  substance is very thick in the middle of the shaft, especially in\r\n  front and internally.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =small metatarsal= bones are a little longer than the corresponding\r\nmetacarpals. The =external= (fourth) =metatarsal= is relatively massive,\r\nespecially in its upper part. The head is large and outstanding, and\r\nbears two facets above for the fourth tarsal, and two in front and\r\ninternally for articulation with the large metatarsal; elsewhere it is\r\nroughened for attachment. The =internal= (second) =metatarsal= is much\r\nmore slender than the outer one, especially in its upper part. The head\r\nbears two facets above for the first and second tarsals, and sometimes\r\none for the third tarsal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE PHALANGES AND SESAMOIDS\r\n\r\nThe axis of the phalanges of the hind limb is about five degrees less\r\noblique than that of the fore limb, and the chief differences in the\r\nform and size of the bones are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe =first phalanx= is a little shorter, wider above, and narrower\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nThe =second phalanx= is narrower and slightly longer.\r\n\r\nThe =third phalanx= is narrower, the angle of inclination of the wall\r\nsurface is a little (ca. 5 degrees) greater, the sole surface is more\r\nconcave, and the wings are less prominent and closer together.\r\n\r\nThe =proximal sesamoids= are a little smaller, except in thickness. The\r\n=third sesamoid= or =navicular bone= is narrower and shorter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SKELETON OF THE OX\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VERTEBRAL COLUMN\r\n\r\nThe vertebral formula is C_{7}T_{13}L_{6}S_{5}Cy_{18–20}.\r\n\r\nThe =cervical vertebræ= are much shorter than those of the horse and are\r\nsmaller in their other dimensions. The =articular processes= are smaller\r\nthan in the horse, and a plate of bone connects each two of the same\r\nside. The transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth are\r\ndouble; the upper part projects backward, and is short and stout; the\r\nlower part is directed downward and forward, and is longer and more\r\nplate-like. The lower part of the sixth transverse process is a large,\r\nthick, quadrilateral and almost sagittal plate, directed downward. The\r\nseventh transverse process is single, short, and thick, and presents no\r\nforamen transversarium; it is in series with the upper part of the\r\npreceding processes. The =spinous processes= are well developed, and\r\nincrease in height from before backward. They are directed upward and\r\nforward, with the exception of the last, which is nearly vertical and is\r\nabout four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) in height. The summit of\r\nthat of the third bone is usually bifid. The =ventral spines= are\r\nprominent and thick in their posterior part; they are absent on the last\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThe =atlas= has a large rough =tuberosity= on its dorsal arch. The\r\n=ventral arch= is very thick. The =wings= are less curved than in the\r\nhorse, and the foramen transversarium (posterior foramen) is absent. The\r\ncavities for the occipital condyles are divided into upper and lower\r\nparts by a non-articular area, and are separated by a narrow interval\r\nbelow. The =posterior articular surfaces= are flattened behind and are\r\ncontinued into the vertebral canal, forming an extensive area for the\r\nodontoid process of the axis.\r\n\r\nThe =axis= is short. The =spine= projects a little in front, and\r\nincreases in height and thickness behind; its posterior border descends\r\nabruptly. The =odontoid process= (dens) is wide, and its upper surface\r\nis deeply concave from side to side. The =intervertebral foramen= is\r\ncircular and not so close to the anterior border of the arch as in the\r\nhorse. The =posterior notches= are not so deep. The =transverse\r\nprocesses= are stouter, but the =foramen transversarium= is small and\r\nsometimes absent.\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic vertebræ=, thirteen in number, are larger than those of\r\nthe horse. The =bodies= are longer and are distinctly constricted in the\r\nmiddle. They bear a thin-edged ventral crest. The =arches=—in addition\r\nto the usual notches, which are shallow—are perforated in the posterior\r\npart by a foramen. The =transverse processes= are thick and strong, and\r\nbear rounded mammillary processes (except at the posterior end of the\r\nseries); the last two, although prominent, do not always articulate with\r\nthe ribs. The =spinous processes= are long. The first is much higher\r\nthan in the horse, the next two are usually the most prominent, and\r\nbehind this there is a very gradual diminution in height. The backward\r\nslope, slight at first, increases to the tenth; the last is vertical and\r\nlumbar in character. The summit is usually pointed on the first, and the\r\nthickening on those further back is less than in the horse. The width\r\ndiminishes from the fifth to the eleventh usually. Both borders of the\r\nspines are in general thin and sharp, but the last three or four\r\nsometimes have thick posterior margins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 88.—SKELETON OF COW.\r\n\r\n  _1.H._, Atlas; _7.H._, seventh cervical vertebra; _1.R._, first\r\n    thoracic vetrebra; _6.R._, sixth rib; _12.R._, twelfth thoracic\r\n    vertebra; _13.R._, last rib; _1.L._, first, _6.L._, last lumbar\r\n    vertebra; _K_, sacrum; _1.S._, first coccygeal vertebra; _6.K._,\r\n    sixth costal cartilage; _x_, wing of atlas; _1_, scapula; _1′_,\r\n    cartilage of scapula; _2_, spine of scapula; _3_, acromion; _4_,\r\n    humerus; _4′_, external condyle of humerus; _5_, external tuberosity\r\n    of humerus; _6_, deltoid tuberosity; _7_, ulna; _8_, olecranon; _9_,\r\n    radius; _10_, carpus; _11_, accessory carpal bone; _12_, metacarpus;\r\n    _13_, phalanges; _14_, sternum; _14′_, manubrium; _14″_, xiphoid\r\n    cartilage; _15_, ilium; _16_, external angle of ilium; _16′_,\r\n    internal angle of ilium; _17_, tuber ischii; _18_, femur; _19_,\r\n    trochanter major; _20_, patella; _21_, tibia; _21′_, external\r\n    condyle of tibia; _22_, tarsus; _23_, distal end of fibula; _24_,\r\n    tuber calcis; _25_, metatarsus; _26_, phalanges. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lumbar vertebræ=, six in number, are much longer than in the horse.\r\nThe =bodies= are much constricted in the middle, expanded at either end,\r\nand bear rudimentary ventral crests. The fourth and fifth are usually\r\nthe longest. The =intervertebral foramina= are often double in the\r\nanterior part of the series, and are very large further back. The\r\n=articular processes= are large, and their facets are more strongly\r\ncurved than in the horse. The =transverse processes= all curve forward.\r\nThey are separated by considerable intervals, and form no articulations\r\nwith each other or with the sacrum. Their borders are thin and\r\nirregular, and often bear projections of variable size and form. The\r\nfirst is the shortest and the length increases to the fifth, the last\r\nbeing considerably shorter. The =spinous processes= are relatively low\r\nand wide, the last being the smallest; their summits are moderately\r\nthickened.\r\n\r\nThe =sacrum= is longer than that of the horse. It consists originally of\r\nfive segments, but fusion is more complete and involves the spinous\r\nprocesses, which are united to form a =median sacral crest=, with a\r\nconvex thick and rough margin. =A lateral crest= is formed by the fusion\r\nof the articular processes. The =pelvic surface= is concave in both\r\ndirections, and is marked by a central =groove=, which indicates the\r\ncourse of the middle sacral artery. The =inferior sacral foramina= are\r\nlarge. The =wings= are quadrangular, short, compressed from before\r\nbackward, and high dorso-ventrally. They have an extensive anterior\r\nsurface, which is concave from side to side, and non-articular. The\r\nposterior surface is rough, and bears a triangular area below for\r\narticulation with the ilium. The body of the first segment is very wide,\r\nand the entrance to the sacral canal correspondingly wide and low. The\r\n=anterior articular processes= are large, and are concave and\r\nsemicylindrical in curvature internally. The =lateral borders= are thin,\r\nsharp, and irregular. The =apex= is wider than in the horse, and the\r\nposterior end of the crest forms a pointed projection over the opening\r\nof the sacral canal.\r\n\r\nThe =coccygeal vertebræ= are longer and better developed than in the\r\nhorse. The first five or six have complete arches and spinous processes.\r\nThe transverse processes are relatively large in the anterior part of\r\nthe series, in which there are also anterior articular processes (which\r\ndo not articulate), and a pair of ventral spines which form a hæmal\r\ngroove for the middle coccygeal artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vertebral curves: The cervical curve is very slight and is concave\r\n  dorsally. The thoracic and lumbar regions form a gentle curve, concave\r\n  ventrally. The promontory is more pronounced than in the horse,\r\n  especially in subjects in which the sacrum is inclined upward behind.\r\n  Another promontory occurs at the junction of the sacrum and first\r\n  coccygeal vertebræ.\r\n\r\n  Length: The following table gives the lengths of the regions of a\r\n  shorthorn cow of medium size:\r\n\r\n                           Cervical   47 cm.\r\n                           Thoracic   75 cm.\r\n                           Lumbar     40 cm.\r\n                           Sacral     24 cm.\r\n                           Coccygeal  75 cm.\r\n                                     ———————\r\n                                     261 cm.\r\n\r\n  Variations: Sometimes fourteen thoracic vertebræ and fourteen pairs of\r\n  ribs are present; reduction to twelve with the normal number of lumbar\r\n  vertebræ is very rare. According to Franck, there are sometimes seven\r\n  lumbar vertebræ with the normal number in the thoracic region. The\r\n  number of coccygeal vertebræ may vary from sixteen to twenty-one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE RIBS\r\n\r\nThirteen pairs of ribs are normally present, of which eight are sternal\r\nand five asternal. They are in general longer, wider, flatter, less\r\ncurved, and less regular in form than in the horse. The eighth, ninth,\r\nand tenth are the longest and widest. The width of most of the ribs\r\nincreases considerably in the middle, and the breadth of the intercostal\r\nspaces is correspondingly diminished. The neck is long, and forms\r\n(except in the posterior part of the series) a smaller angle with the\r\nshaft than in the horse. The articular surface of the tubercle is\r\nconcave transversely, except on the last two or three, where the facet\r\nis small and flat or absent. The lower ends of the second to the tenth\r\nor eleventh inclusive form diarthrodial joints with the costal\r\ncartilages. The first costal cartilages are very short; they articulate\r\nby their internal surfaces with the sternum, but not with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The presence of a fourteenth rib is not very rare. It is usually\r\n  floating and may correspond to an additional thoracic vertebra or to\r\n  the first lumbar. Reduction of the thirteenth is more common. The\r\n  eighth cartilage often does not reach the sternum, but articulates\r\n  with the seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =sternum= consists of seven sternebræ, most of which are developed\r\nfrom two lateral centers. It is wider, flatter, and relatively longer\r\nthan in the horse, and the ventral crest or “keel” is absent. The\r\nmanubrium is somewhat wedge-shaped and laterally compressed. Its base\r\nforms a diarthrodial joint with the body of the bone, and laterally it\r\nbears extensive facets for articulation with the first pair of costal\r\ncartilages. The body widens from before backward, but behind the last\r\npair of costal facets it becomes much narrower. The ventral surface is\r\nprominent on the second and third segments, concave further back. The\r\nlateral borders are notched for the passage of vessels. The cariniform\r\ncartilage is absent. The xiphoid cartilage is like that of the horse but\r\nis smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE THORAX\r\n\r\nThe bony thorax is shorter than in the horse. The inlet is higher. The\r\nroof is short, and the floor wider and relatively longer. The transverse\r\ndiameter is wider in the posterior part. The summits of the spinous\r\nprocesses are almost in a straight line from the second thoracic to the\r\nmiddle of the lumbar region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BONES OF THE SKULL\r\n\r\n\r\n                          BONES OF THE CRANIUM\r\n\r\nThe =occipital bone= is situated in the lower part only of the posterior\r\nsurface of the skull, and is separated from the highest part (the\r\nfrontal eminence) by the parietal and interparietal bones. The\r\nsupraoccipital, interparietals, and parietals fuse before birth or soon\r\nafter, and the mass so formed is separated from the lateral parts of the\r\noccipital bone by a transverse suture in the skull of the calf. Above\r\nthis suture is a central tuberosity, to which the ligamentum nuchæ is\r\nattached, and the surface on either side is depressed and rough for\r\nmuscular attachment. Below the suture the bone is much wider than that\r\nof the horse. The foramen magnum is wide, so that the condyles are\r\nfurther apart except below. The paramastoid processes are short and wide\r\nand are bent inward. Two constant foramina are found in the condyloid\r\nfossa; the anterior one is the hypoglossal, the other (sometimes double)\r\nconducts a vein from the =condyloid canal=. The latter passes upward\r\nfrom a foramen on the inner side of the condyle and opens into the\r\nparieto-temporal canal. The cranial surface of the supraoccipital\r\npresents a central depression, and above this is a variable but never\r\nvery pronounced eminence, which corresponds to the tentorium osseum of\r\nthe horse. On either side is a groove leading to the parieto-temporal\r\ncanal. The basilar process is short and wide; its cranial surface is\r\ndeeply concave, and the internal spheno-occipital crest is prominent.\r\nTwo large tubercles below mark the junction with the sphenoid. The\r\nforamen lacerum is short and very narrow. In the adult animal the bone\r\nis excavated to contain an air-cavity which is regarded as a part of the\r\nfrontal sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =sphenoid bone= is short. The cranial surface of the body presents a\r\ndeep sella turcica, in front of which it rises abruptly. The high\r\nanterior part bears a central ridge (Rostrum sphenoidale), which joins\r\nthe crista galli of the ethmoid. Two foramina occur on either side. Of\r\nthese, the large anterior one is equivalent to the foramen rotundum,\r\nlacerum orbitale, and patheticum of the horse. The posterior one is the\r\n=foramen ovale=, which transmits the inferior maxillary nerve. The\r\norbital wing is thick and is overlapped by the frontal in such manner as\r\nto appear externally to divide into two branches; the anterior part\r\njoins the ethmoid close to the sphenopalatine foramen, and contains a\r\nsmall sinus which communicates with an ethmoidal meatus. The temporal\r\nwing is small, but forms a prominent thick pterygoid crest. The\r\npterygoid process is wide, and the pterygoid or alar foramen is absent.\r\nThe sphenoidal sinus is absent in the calf and small in the adult; it\r\ncommunicates by one or two small openings with an ethmoidal meatus, and\r\nso with the nasal cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 89.—SKULL AND ATLAS OF OX, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _9_, Zygomatic arch; _11_, coronoid process; _12_, supraorbital\r\n    process; _13″_, paramastoid or styloid process; _13‴_, occipital\r\n    condyle; _14_, parietal bone; _15_, frontal bone; _16_, squamous\r\n    temporal bone; _17_, external auditory meatus; _18_, temporal\r\n    condyle; _19_, orbital surface of lacrimal bone; _20_, malar bone;\r\n    _21_, facial surface of lacrimal bone; _22_, nasal bone; _23_, nasal\r\n    process of premaxilla; _24′_, incisor teeth; _26_, maxilla; _27_,\r\n    facial tuberosity; infraorbital foramen in front of _27_; _28′_,\r\n    molar part of ramus of mandible; _30_, broad vertical part of ramus;\r\n    _30′_, angle of jaw; _31_, condyle of mandible; _32_, atlas; _x_,\r\n    wing of atlas. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =ethmoid bone= has an extensive perpendicular plate. The lateral\r\nmass consists of five endoturbinals and eighteen ectoturbinals (Paulli).\r\nThe largest ethmoturbinal is so extensive as to be termed a third or\r\nmiddle turbinal bone; it projects forward between the upper and lower\r\nturbinals. The lamina papyracea appears to a small extent externally in\r\nthe pterygo-palatine fossa, forming part of the upper margin of the\r\nsphenopalatine foramen.\r\n\r\nThe =interparietals= are primitively paired, but unite before birth. As\r\nalready mentioned, fusion occurs before or shortly after birth with the\r\nparietals and supraoccipital. No distinct tentorium osseum is present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 90.—SKULL OF OX, BASAL VIEW, WITHOUT MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\n  _F_, Pterygoid bone; _G_, horizontal and _G′_, perpendicular part of\r\n    palate bone; _H_, occipital bone; _J_, malar bone; _K_, sphenoid\r\n    bone; _O_, maxilla; _P_, vomer; _Sch._, squamous temporal; _St._,\r\n    frontal bone; _Z_, premaxilla; _1_, for. magnum; _2_, occipital\r\n    condyle; _3_, paramastoid (styloid) process of occipital; _4_,\r\n    hypoglossal and condyloid foramina; _5_, for. lacerum; _6_,\r\n    pharyngeal tubercles; _7_, bulla ossea; _8_, muscular process (left\r\n    one is removed to expose for. ovale); _9_, hyoid process; _10_, ext.\r\n    auditory meatus; _11_, zygomatic process; _12_, external opening of\r\n    parieto-temporal canal; _13_, postglenoid process; _14_, temporal\r\n    condyle; _15_, for. ovale; _16_, for. lac. orbitale + for. rotundum;\r\n    _17_, optic foramen; _18_, ethmoidal foramen; _19_, orbital opening\r\n    of supraorbital canal; _20_, pterygoid crest; _21_, hamulus of\r\n    pterygoid bone; _22_, lacrimal bulla; _23_, temporal process of\r\n    malar; _24_, pterygoid process of maxilla; _25_, sphenopalatine\r\n    foramen; _26_, maxillary foramen; _27_, posterior palatine foramen;\r\n    _28_, anterior palatine foramen; _29_, accessory palatine foramina;\r\n    _30_, palate process of maxilla; _31_, interalveolar border; _32_,\r\n    palatine cleft; _33_, palate process of premaxilla; _34_, fissura\r\n    incisiva; _35_, facial tuberosity; _36_, posterior nares.\r\n    (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =parietal bones= do not enter into the formation of the roof of the\r\ncranium. They constitute the upper part of the posterior wall, and bend\r\nsharply forward along the lateral wall, forming part of the wall of the\r\ntemporal fossa. The line of inflection is marked by the prominent\r\n=parietal crest=, which is continuous with the temporal crest below. The\r\nparietals are excavated to form part of the frontal sinuses in the adult\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The condition in the young subject is as follows: The two parietals\r\n  are united with each other and also with the interparietal and\r\n  supraoccipital. The resulting mass is somewhat horseshoe-shaped. Its\r\n  occipital part (Planum occipitale) forms the greater part of the\r\n  posterior wall of the cranium and bears about its center the\r\n  tuberosity for the attachment of the ligamentum nuchæ. From either\r\n  side of this a line curves outward, and divides the surface into an\r\n  upper smooth area and a lower area which is rough for muscular\r\n  attachment. The upper border joins the frontal bone and concurs in the\r\n  formation of the frontal eminence. The temporal parts (Plana\r\n  temporalia) are much smaller and are concave externally; they join the\r\n  frontal above and the squamous temporal below.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 91.—SKULL OF OX, DORSAL VIEW (WITH MANDIBLE).\r\n\r\n  _12_, Supraorbital process; _14_, parietal bone; _15_, frontal bone;\r\n    _16_, squamous temporal bone; _19_, orbit; _20_, malar bone; _21_,\r\n    lacrimal bone; _22_, nasal bone; _23_, premaxilla; _26_, maxilla;\r\n    _27_, facial tuberosity; _24_, incisor teeth.

(After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =frontal bones= are very extensive, forming about one-half of the\r\nentire length of the skull, and all of the roof of the cranium. The\r\nposterior borders form with the parietals a large central =frontal\r\neminence= (Torus frontalis), the highest point of the skull. At the\r\njunction of the posterior and the lateral borders are the =processus\r\ncornu= or “horn-cores,” for the support of the horns. These processes\r\nare of elongated conical form, and vary greatly in size, length,\r\ncurvature, and direction. The external surface is rough and porous,\r\nmarked by numerous grooves and foramina; in the fresh state they are\r\ncovered by the matrix of the horns. The base has a constriction, the\r\nneck. The interior is excavated to form a number of irregular\r\nintercommunicating spaces, divided by bony septa, and communicating with\r\nthe frontal sinus. In the polled breeds these processes are absent, the\r\nskull is narrower in this region, and the frontal eminence more\r\npronounced. The supraorbital process is situated about half-way between\r\nthe anterior and posterior margins; it is short and joins the frontal\r\nprocess of the malar bone. The supraorbital foramen (often double) is\r\nsituated about an inch inward from the root of the process; it is the\r\nexternal orifice of the =supraorbital canal= (Canalis supraorbitalis),\r\nwhich passes downward and forward into the orbit. The foramen is in the\r\ncourse of the =supraorbital groove= (Sulcus supraorbitalis), which marks\r\nthe course of the frontal vein. The anterior ends of the naso-frontal\r\nparts form a notch which receives the nasal bones, and sutural or\r\nWormian bones are often found at this junction (naso-frontal suture).\r\nThe orbital part is extensive; it is perforated behind by the orbital\r\nopening of the supraorbital canal, and below by the ethmoidal or\r\ninternal orbital foramen. It does not articulate with the palatine, from\r\nwhich it is separated by the orbital wing of the sphenoid. The temporal\r\npart is also more extensive than in the horse. The frontal sinus is very\r\nextensive, being continued into the parietals and occipital, and the\r\nhorn processes when present.\r\n\r\nThe =squamous= and =petrous parts= of the =temporal bone= fuse early—in\r\nfact, union is nearly complete at birth. The squamous part is relatively\r\nsmall. Its external surface is divided into two parts by the prominent\r\ntemporal crest, which is continuous with the parietal crest above and\r\nturns forward below, ending at a tubercle above the external auditory\r\nmeatus. The part behind the crest faces backward, and is partly free,\r\npartly united with the occipital. The area in front of the crest is\r\nconcave and enters into the formation of the temporal fossa; it is\r\nperforated by foramina which communicate with the parieto-temporal\r\ncanal. The zygomatic process is much shorter and weaker than in the\r\nhorse, and articulates with the malar only. The condyle is convex in\r\nboth directions. The postglenoid process is less prominent, and behind\r\nit is the chief external opening of the parieto-temporal canal. The\r\ninternal surface is almost completely overlapped by the parietal and\r\nsphenoid. The petrous part proper is small, but the tympanic part is\r\nextensive. The external auditory meatus is smaller than in the horse and\r\nis directed outward. From it a plate projects downward and helps to\r\ninclose the deep depression in which the hyoid process is placed. Behind\r\nthis plate is the stylo-mastoid foramen. The muscular process is large\r\nand often bifid at its free end. The bulla ossea is large and laterally\r\ncompressed. It is separated from the occipital bone by a narrow opening\r\nwhich is equivalent to part of the foramen lacerum basis cranii of the\r\nhorse. The parieto-temporal canal is formed entirely in the temporal\r\nbone. The facial canal, on the other hand, is bounded partly by the\r\noccipital bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BONES OF THE FACE\r\n\r\nThe =maxilla= is shorter but broader and relatively higher than in the\r\nhorse. Its external surface bears instead of the facial crest a rough\r\n=facial tuberosity= (Tuber malare), placed above the third cheek tooth;\r\na rough curved line often extends from it to the upper part of the malar\r\nbone. The infraorbital foramen—often double—is situated above the first\r\ncheek tooth. The tuber maxillare is small, laterally compressed, and\r\nusually bears a small pointed process (Processus pterygoideus). The\r\nzygomatic process is very small. The interalveolar border is concave,\r\nand there is no alveolus for a canine tooth. The palatine process is\r\nwider, but somewhat shorter than in the horse. It incloses a large\r\nair-space, which is continuous behind with a like cavity in the\r\nhorizontal part of the palate bone, forming the =palatine sinus=. This\r\ncommunicates externally (over the infraorbital canal) with the maxillary\r\nsinus; in the macerated skull it communicates with the nasal cavity by a\r\nlarge oval opening, which is closed by mucous membrane in the fresh\r\nstate. A median septum separates the two palatine sinuses. The alveoli\r\nfor the cheek teeth increase in size from before backward. The maxillary\r\nsinus proper is small and is undivided. The maxillary foramen is a\r\nnarrow fissure, deeply placed at the inner side of the lacrimal bulla.\r\nThe maxilla takes no part in the formation of the palatine canal.\r\nSutural (or Wormian) bones may be found at its junction with the\r\nlacrimal and malar bones.\r\n\r\nThe body of the =premaxilla= is thin and flattened, and has no alveoli,\r\nsince the canine and upper incisor teeth are absent. A deep notch takes\r\nthe place of the foramen incisivum. The nasal process is short, convex\r\nexternally, and is not closely attached to the nasal bone; the space\r\nbetween the two processes is greater than in the horse. The palatine\r\nprocess is narrow and is grooved on its nasal surface for the septal\r\ncartilage and the vomer. The palatine cleft is very wide.\r\n\r\nThe =palatine bone= is very extensive. The =horizontal part= forms\r\none-fourth or more of the hard palate. The anterior palatine foramen\r\nopens near the junction with the maxilla, about half an inch from the\r\nmedian palatine suture and crest. =Accessory palatine foramina= are also\r\npresent. The palatine groove is usually not very distinct. The palatine\r\ncanal is formed entirely in this part, and there is no articulation with\r\nthe vomer. A rounded ridge occurs on the nasal side of the median\r\nsuture. The interior is hollow, forming part of the palatine sinus. The\r\n=perpendicular part= is an extensive, quadrilateral, thin plate, which\r\nforms the posterior part of the lateral wall of the nasal cavity and in\r\npart bounds the narrow posterior nares. Its internal surface is nearly\r\nflat, and is smooth and free, except behind, where it is overlapped by\r\nthe pterygoid bone. The external surface is attached to a small extent\r\nto the pterygoid process behind, and is free elsewhere. The\r\nsphenopalatine foramen is a long elliptical opening, formed by a deep\r\nnotch in the upper edge of the palate bone and completed by the ethmoid\r\nand sphenoid. The edge behind this foramen articulates with the orbital\r\nwing of the sphenoid, not the frontal as in the horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 93.—MEDIAN SECTION OF SKULL OF OX, WITHOUT THE MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\n  The mucous membrane is retained.

(After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =pterygoid bone= is wider than in the horse, and forms the greater\r\npart of the lateral boundary of the posterior nares. Its outer surface\r\nis almost entirely united to the palate bone and the pterygoid process,\r\nbut a small part is free in the pterygo-palatine fossa. The hamulus is\r\ndistinctly hook-like, thin, and sharp.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal bone= is little more than half the length of that of the\r\nhorse. It is straight in its length, but strongly curved from side to\r\nside. It does not fuse laterally with the adjacent bones, even in old\r\nage. The posterior extremity is pointed and fits into the notch between\r\nthe frontal bones. The anterior end is broader, and is divided into two\r\nparts by a deep notch. In old animals there is a small extension of the\r\nfrontal sinus into this bone.\r\n\r\nThe =lacrimal bone= is very large. The extensive facial part is concave\r\nin its length, and bears no lacrimal tubercle. The orbital margin is\r\nmarked by several notches. The orbital part forms below the remarkable\r\n=lacrimal bulla=; this is a large and very thin-walled protuberance,\r\nwhich bulges backward into the lower part of the orbit, and contains an\r\nextension of the maxillary sinus. The lacrimal fossa is small, and is\r\njust behind the orbital margin.\r\n\r\nThe =malar bone= is relatively long. The facial surface is extensive; it\r\nbears a curved crest (Crista facialis) just below the orbital margin,\r\nand below this it is concave from above downward. The zygomatic process\r\ndivides into two branches; of these, the frontal process turns upward\r\nand backward and joins the supraorbital process of the frontal bone; the\r\ntemporal process continues backward, and is overlapped by the zygomatic\r\nprocess of the temporal bone, completing the zygomatic arch.\r\n\r\nThe =superior turbinal bone= is less cribriform and fragile than in the\r\nhorse, and is thickest in its middle, small at either end. It is\r\nattached to the turbinal crest of the nasal bone, and curves downward,\r\noutward, and upward to be applied outwardly to the frontal and lacrimal\r\nbones. It thus incloses a cavity which communicates with the middle\r\nmeatus nasi. (In the macerated skull it opens into the frontal sinus,\r\nbut this communication is closed by mucous membrane in the fresh state.)\r\n\r\nThe =inferior turbinal bone= is shorter but much broader than in the\r\nhorse. It is attached to the maxilla by a basal lamella about an inch\r\n(ca. 2 to 3 cm.) wide, which slopes downward and inward. At the inner\r\nedge of this it splits into two plates which are rolled in opposite\r\ndirections, and inclose two separate cavities, subdivided by several\r\nsepta. The upper one opens into the middle meatus, the lower one into\r\nthe inferior meatus nasi.\r\n\r\nThe =vomer= forms a wider and deeper groove than in the horse. Its\r\nanterior end rests in a groove formed by the ends of the palatine\r\nprocesses of the premaxillæ. The anterior third of its thin lower edge\r\nfits into the nasal crest of the maxilla; behind this it is free and\r\nseparated by a considerable interval from the nasal floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 94.—HYOID BONE OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Body; _b_, lingual process; _c_, thyroid cornu and cartilage,\r\n    _c′_; _d_, small cornu; _e_, middle cornu; _f_, great cornu; _g_,\r\n    muscular angle of _f_. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe two halves of the =mandible= do not fuse completely even in advanced\r\nage. The symphyseal surfaces are extremely rough and are marked by\r\nreciprocal projections and cavities. The body is shorter, wider, and\r\nflatter than in the horse, and has eight round and relatively shallow\r\nalveoli for the lower incisors. The interalveolar border is long,\r\ncurved, thin and sharp. There are no alveoli for the canine teeth, which\r\nare absent. The anterior part of the ramus constitutes a long narrow\r\nneck. The mental foramen is further forward than in the horse, and is in\r\nthe posterior end of a fossa. The rami diverge more, so that the\r\nsubmaxillary space is wider than in the horse. They are also more\r\nstrongly curved, and the angle is more pronounced. The molar part is not\r\nso high, especially in its anterior part. Its lower border is convex in\r\nits length. Its upper border bears six alveoli for the lower cheek\r\nteeth; the first is quite small, and they increase in size from before\r\nbackward. The vertical part is much smaller than in the horse and its\r\nposterior border is relatively thin below, concave and wider above. The\r\nmandibular foramen is about in the middle of its inner surface, and a\r\ngroove for the lingual nerve curves downward and forward from it. The\r\ncondyle projects inward further than in the horse, and is concave from\r\nside to side. The coronoid process is extensive and curves backward.\r\n\r\nThe =hyoid bone= has a short tuberous lingual process. The middle cornua\r\nare almost, as large as the small cornua. The great cornua are narrow,\r\nexcept at the ends. The upper end divides into two branches, which\r\ncorrespond to the two angles of that of the horse. The thyroid cornua do\r\nnot fuse with the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SKULL OF THE OX AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\nThe skull of the ox is more clearly pyramidal than that of the horse,\r\nand is shorter and relatively wider. The cranium is quadrangular and\r\nlarger externally than in the horse; its large size is due mainly to the\r\ngreat extent of the frontal sinus, and does not affect the cranial\r\ncavity, which is smaller than in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =superior= or =frontal surface= is formed by the frontals, nasals,\r\nand premaxillæ. The frontal part is quadrilateral and very extensive,\r\nthe greatest width being at the orbits. It presents a central depression\r\non its anterior part, and on either side are the supraorbital grooves\r\nand foramina. Behind is the median frontal eminence, and at the lateral\r\nangles the “horn-cores” project in horned cattle. The nasal part is very\r\nshort. The osseous nasal aperture is wide. The premaxillæ do not bend\r\ndownward as in the horse; they are relatively thin and weak, and are\r\nseparated by an interval which has a wide anterior part in place of the\r\nforamen incisivum.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral surface= is more triangular than in the horse. The temporal\r\nfossa is confined to this surface. It is deep and narrow, and its\r\nboundaries are more complete. It is limited above by a crest which\r\nextends from the postero-external angle of the frontal to the\r\nsupraorbital process, and is analogous to the sagittal crest of the\r\nhorse. Behind it is bounded by the temporal crest. It is clearly marked\r\noff from the orbit by the rounded posterior orbital ridge and the\r\npterygoid crest. The zygomatic process is short, weak, and flattened,\r\nand is formed by the temporal and malar only. Its condyle is convex and\r\nis wide from before backward. The glenoid cavity and postglenoid process\r\nare small. The orbit is encroached upon below by the lacrimal bulla, and\r\npresents the orifice of the supraorbital canal behind. The margin is\r\ncompleted behind by the frontal process of the malar; its lower part is\r\nprominent and rough, not smooth and rounded as in the horse. The\r\npterygo-palatine fossa is much larger, deeper, and more clearly defined.\r\nIt has a long narrow forward extension (maxillary hiatus) between the\r\nvertical plate of the palate bone internally and the maxilla and\r\nlacrimal bulla externally; thus the sphenopalatine and maxillary\r\nforamina are deeply placed. The preorbital region is short but\r\nrelatively high. A tuberosity and curved line take the place of the\r\nfacial crest. The infraorbital foramen is situated above the first cheek\r\ntooth and is often double.\r\n\r\nThe =basal surface= is short and wide, especially in its cranial part.\r\nThe occipital condyles are limited in front by transverse ridges. The\r\ntubercles at the junction of the occipital and sphenoid are large. The\r\ncondyloid fossæ contain two foramina, the hypoglossal below and in\r\nfront, and the condyloid above and behind; other inconstant ones occur.\r\nThe paramastoid processes are short and convergent. The foramen lacerum\r\nis slit-like. The bulla ossea is a large, laterally compressed\r\nprominence. The muscular processes are usually long and narrow\r\ntriangular plates, with one or two sharp points. The external auditory\r\nprocess is directed almost straight outward. A curved plate extends\r\ndownward from it and joins the bulla ossea internally, completing the\r\ndeep cavity which receives the articular angle of the hyoid bone. The\r\nchief external opening of the temporal canal is in front of this plate,\r\nand an accessory one lies behind it. The infratemporal fossa is small,\r\nand presents the foramen ovale. The posterior nares are very narrow, and\r\nthe vomer does not reach to the level of their margin. The hard palate\r\nis wide, and forms about three-fifths of the entire length of the skull.\r\nA small central part only of its posterior border enters into the\r\nformation of the posterior nares; the lateral parts are notched and just\r\nabove them are the posterior palatine foramina. The anterior palatine\r\nforamina are an inch or more from the posterior margin, and about the\r\nsame distance apart. The palatine grooves are distinct for a short\r\ndistance only. Just beyond the cheek teeth the palate narrows and\r\nbecomes concave; beyond this it widens and flattens.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =nuchal surface= is extensive and somewhat pentagonal\r\nin outline in the adult. About its center is the eminence for the\r\nattachment of the ligamentum nuchæ. From this a median crest extends\r\ntoward the foramen magnum, and laterally two lines (Lineæ nuchæ\r\nsuperiores) curve outward, marking the upper limit of the area which is\r\nroughened for muscular attachment. The surface above the lines is\r\nrelatively smooth, and is covered only by the skin and the thin\r\nauricular muscles in the living animal. It is separated from the cranial\r\nroof by a thick border, which forms centrally the frontal eminence, and\r\nbears at its extremities the processus cornu—except in the polled\r\nbreeds. The condyles are further apart, and the articular surfaces are\r\nmore clearly divided into upper and lower parts than in the horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 95.—CROSS-SECTION OF SKULL OF OX.

(After Ellenberger, in\r\n    Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =cranial cavity= is shorter and its long axis is more oblique than\r\nin the horse, but it is relatively high and wide. The anterior fossa\r\nlies at a much higher level than the rest of the floor. The olfactory\r\nfossæ are smaller, and the sella turcica is much deeper than in the\r\nhorse. A deep groove leads from the petrous temporal forward over the\r\nforamen ovale to the foramen rotundum. Behind the sella there is often a\r\ndistinct prominence (Dorsum sellæ). The internal sagittal crest is\r\nprominent anteriorly, but absent further back. A faintly marked\r\nelevation takes the place of the tentorium osseum. The small petrous\r\ntemporal bone projects into the cavity laterally. The ridges and digital\r\nimpressions are very pronounced. The parieto-temporal canal is formed\r\nentirely in the temporal bone, and opens at the apex of the petrous,\r\nwhere it is joined by the condyloid canal. The foramen lacerum is\r\ndivided into two parts (For. lacerum anterius et posterius).\r\n\r\nThe =nasal cavity= is incompletely divided by the septum, which does not\r\nreach the floor posteriorly. The floor is relatively long, and is more\r\nconcave from side to side than in the horse. In the dry skull it has a\r\nlarge oval opening into the palatine sinus, which is closed during life\r\nby mucous membrane. The middle meatus is divided behind into upper and\r\nlower branches by the great ethmoturbinal. The posterior nares are\r\nnarrow and oblique.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 97.—SKULL OF OX, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The outer plate of bone has been removed to show the sinuses. _a_,\r\n    Frontal sinus; _a′_, cranial plate of frontal bone; _a″_, anterior\r\n    part of frontal sinus, which is separated from remainder by a septum\r\n    (_b_); _c_, _c′_, communications between frontal sinus and nasal\r\n    cavity; _d_, supraorbital foramen; _e_, supraorbital canal; _f_,\r\n    cavity of superior turbinal bone, and _g_, its opening into the\r\n    nasal cavity; _h_, lacrimal sinus, _i_, its communication with the\r\n    maxillary sinus; _k_, maxillary sinus; _l_, orbit; _1_, frontal\r\n    bone; _1′_, processus cornu; _2_, nasal bone; _3_, premaxilla (nasal\r\n    process); _4_, maxilla; _5_, lacrimal bone; _6_, malar bone; _7_,\r\n    dotted line indicating course of naso-lacrimal duct. (After\r\n    Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =frontal sinus= is very large. It involves almost all of the frontal\r\nbone and a large part of the posterior wall of the cranium. It also\r\nextends for a variable distance into the horn processes when these are\r\npresent. A complete median septum separates the right and left sinuses.\r\nThe anterior limit is indicated by a transverse plane through the middle\r\nof the orbits. It extends externally to the crest which limits the\r\ntemporal fossa above, and into the root of the supraorbital process. At\r\nthe highest part of the cranial cavity and at the tuberosity on the\r\nposterior surface the two plates of the bone come together. The cavity\r\nis very irregular and is subdivided into numerous spaces by ridges and\r\npartial septa. This multilocular character is most marked in the\r\nanterior part, and here several small spaces appear to be cut off from\r\nthe main cavity (Baum). The supraorbital canal passes through the sinus.\r\nSeveral small openings lead from the sinus to the ethmoidal meatuses,\r\nand thus indirectly to the upper division of the middle meatus nasi. The\r\ncommunications with the cavity of the superior turbinal and with the\r\nlacrimal part of the maxillary sinus which are seen in the macerated\r\nskull are closed in the fresh state by mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 98.—SKULL OF OX, LATERAL VIEW WITHOUT MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\n  The maxillary, lacrimal, and turbinal sinuses have been opened, and a\r\n    portion of the orbit removed, _a_, Cavity of superior turbinal bone;\r\n    _b_, lacrimal sinus; _c_, maxillary sinus; _d_, communication\r\n    between maxillary and palatine sinuses; _e_, opening between\r\n    maxillary and lacrimal sinuses; _f_, thin osseous bulla; _g_,\r\n    lacrimal bulla; _h_, orbit; _1–6_, cheek teeth; _7_, nasal bone;\r\n    _8_, premaxilla (nasal process); _9_, maxilla; _9′_, infraorbital\r\n    foramen; _10_, frontal bone; _11_, lacrimal bone; _12_, malar bone;\r\n    _13_, fissure between nasal bone and maxilla; _14_, temporal bone\r\n    (squamous); _15_, external auditory meatus; _16_, styloid or\r\n    paramastoid process; _17_, occipital condyle; _18_, palate bone\r\n    (perpendicular part); _19_, pterygoid bone (hamulus); _20_, tympanic\r\n    part of temporal; _20′_, muscular process of petrous temporal.\r\n    (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =maxillary sinus= is excavated chiefly in the maxilla, lacrimal, and\r\nmalar, and is not divided by a septum as in the horse. It extends\r\nforward as far as the facial tuberosity, or a little further in old\r\nanimals. Its upper limit is indicated approximately by a line drawn from\r\nthe infraorbital foramen to the upper margin of the orbit. It is\r\ncontinued directly backward into the lacrimal bulla to a point nearly\r\nopposite to the bifurcation of the zygomatic process of the malar. It\r\nalso extends upward and backward through a large opening into a cavity\r\nformed by the lacrimal, frontal, ethmoid, and turbinal bones, at the\r\ninner side of the orbit.[26] The floor of the cavity is irregular and\r\nthe roots of the last three or four cheek teeth project up into it,\r\ncovered by a plate of bone. The sinus communicates with the palatine\r\nsinus freely over the infraorbital canal through an oval opening about\r\ntwo to three inches (ca. 5 to 7.5 cm.) long. Above this it communicates\r\nby a shorter and much narrower opening with the middle meatus nasi.\r\n\r\nThe =palatine sinus= is excavated in the hard palate, and is separated\r\nfrom that of the opposite side by a median septum. It extends from the\r\nposterior border of the palate to a plane an inch or more (2.5 to 3 cm.)\r\nin front of the first cheek tooth. As mentioned above, there is a large\r\ncommunication with the maxillary sinus over the infraorbital canal, so\r\nthat the cavity is sometimes regarded as a part of that sinus. The large\r\ndefect in the bony roof of the sinus is closed by two layers of mucous\r\nmembrane in the fresh state. The palatine canal passes obliquely through\r\nthe posterior part of the sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =sphenoidal sinus= is almost entirely in the sphenoid bone and does\r\nnot communicate with the palatine and maxillary sinus. It has one or two\r\nopenings into the ventral ethmoidal meatuses. There is no cavity in the\r\nperpendicular part of the palate bone.\r\n\r\nThere are several small air-cavities between the lateral mass of the\r\nethmoid and the anterior part of the frontal sinus, which communicate\r\nseparately with ethmoidal meatuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BONES OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =scapula= is more regularly triangular than in the horse, relatively\r\nwider at the vertebral end and narrower at the lower end. The scapular\r\nindex is about 1 ∶ 0.6. The spine is more prominent and is placed\r\nfurther forward, so that the supraspinous fossa is narrow and does not\r\nextend to the lower part of the bone. The spine is sinuous, bent\r\nbackward in its middle, forward below. Its free border is somewhat\r\nthickened in its middle, but bears no distinct tubercle. Instead of\r\nsubsiding below as in the horse the spine becomes a little more\r\nprominent, and is prolonged by a pointed projection, the =acromion=,\r\nfrom which part of the deltoid muscle arises. The subscapular fossa is\r\nshallow. The areas for the attachment of the serratus muscle are not\r\nvery distinct. The nutrient foramen is usually in the lower third of the\r\nposterior border. The glenoid cavity is almost circular and without any\r\ndistinct notch. The tuberosity is small and close to the glenoid cavity.\r\nThe coracoid process is short and rounded. The cartilage resembles that\r\nof the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =humerus= has a shallow musculo-spiral groove. The deltoid\r\ntuberosity is less prominent than in the horse, and the curved line\r\nrunning from it to the neck bears a well-marked tubercle on its upper\r\npart. The nutrient foramen is usually in the lower third of the\r\nposterior surface. The external tuberosity is very large, and rises an\r\ninch or more (ca. 3 cm.) above the level of the head. Its anterior part\r\ncurves inward over the bicipital groove, and below it externally there\r\nis a prominent circular rough area for the insertion of the tendon of\r\nthe supraspinatus. The anterior part of the internal tuberosity has a\r\nsmall projection which curves over the groove. The groove is undivided.\r\nThe distal articular surface is decidedly oblique, and the grooves and\r\nridge are very well marked. The coronoid and olecranon fossæ are deep\r\nand wide. The external condyloid crest is represented by a rough raised\r\narea. The proximal end unites with the shaft at three and one-half to\r\nfour years, and the distal at about one and one-half years.\r\n\r\nThe =radius= is short and relatively broad. It is somewhat oblique, the\r\nlower end being nearer the median plane than the upper. The curvature is\r\nmore pronounced below than above. The shaft is prismatic in its middle\r\npart and has anterior, external, and posterior faces. There is a marked\r\nincrease in width and thickness below. The proximal articular surface\r\npresents a synovial fossa which extends inward from the deep groove\r\nbetween the two glenoid cavities. The bicipital tuberosity is\r\nrepresented by a slightly elevated rough area. The posterior facets for\r\nthe ulna are larger than in the horse. The two bones commonly fuse above\r\nthe proximal interosseous space and always fuse below it, except near\r\nthe distal end, where there is a small distal interosseous space. A\r\ngroove connects the two spaces externally. The distal extremity is\r\nlarge, and is thickest internally. Its articular surface is oblique in\r\ntwo directions, _i. e._, from within upward and backward. The grooves\r\nfor the extensor tendons are shallow. The proximal end unites with the\r\nshaft at one to one and one-half years, and the distal at three and\r\none-half to four years.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The approximation of the lower ends of the forearms and the carpi\r\n  gives the “knock-kneed” appearance in cattle. The obliquity of the\r\n  joint surfaces produces lateral deviation of the lower part of the\r\n  limb in flexion. The facets for the radial and intermediate carpals\r\n  are narrower than in the horse and run obliquely forward and outward.\r\n  The surface for the ulnar carpal is extensive and saddle-shaped; its\r\n  outer part is furnished by the ulna.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 99.—SKELETON OF LEFT FORE LIMB OF OX, FROM SHOULDER DOWNWARD,\r\n    ANTERIOR VIEW. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =ulna= is more fully developed than in the horse. The shaft is\r\ncomplete, three-sided, and strongly curved. It is fused with the radius\r\nin the adult, except at the two interosseous spaces mentioned above. Its\r\nupper part contains a medullary canal which extends somewhat into the\r\nproximal end. The olecranon is large and bears a rounded tuberosity\r\nabove. The distal end is fused with the radius; it projects below the\r\nlevel of the latter, forming the =styloid process= (Processus styloideus\r\nulnæ), which furnishes part of the facet for the ulnar carpal. The\r\nproximal and distal ends unite with the shaft at three and one-half to\r\nfour years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 100.—SKELETON OF LEFT FORE LIMB OF OX, FROM ELBOW DOWNWARD,\r\n    EXTERNAL VIEW. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =carpus= consists of six bones, four in the upper row, and two in\r\nthe lower. The upper row is oblique in conformity with the carpal\r\narticular surface of the radius. The radial and intermediate resemble in\r\ngeneral those of the horse, but are less regular in shape, and their\r\nlong axes are directed obliquely backward and inward. The radial is\r\nnarrower than in the horse and curves upward behind. The intermediate is\r\nconstricted in its middle, and wider behind than in front. The ulnar is\r\nlarge and very irregular. Its proximal surface is extensive and sinuous\r\nand articulates with both radius and ulna. Behind is a large oval facet\r\nfor articulation with the accessory carpal. The accessory is short,\r\nthick, and rounded; it articulates with the ulnar carpal only. The first\r\ncarpal is absent. The second and third carpals are fused to form a large\r\nquadrilateral bone. The fourth carpal is a smaller quadrilateral bone.\r\n\r\nThe =metacarpus= consists of a large metacarpal and an external small\r\nmetacarpal bone. The large metacarpal bone (Mc. 3 + 4) results from the\r\nfusion of the third and fourth bones of the fœtus, and bears evidences\r\nof its double origin even in the adult state. The shaft is shorter than\r\nin the horse, and is relatively wider and flatter. The anterior surface\r\nis rounded, and is marked by a vertical vascular groove connecting two\r\ncanals which traverse the ends of the shaft from before backward. The\r\nposterior surface is flat and presents a similar but much fainter\r\ngroove. The borders are rough in the upper third. The proximal end bears\r\ntwo slightly concave facets for articulation with the bones of the lower\r\nrow of the carpus; the inner area is the larger, and they are separated\r\nby a ridge in front and a notch behind. The outer angle has a facet\r\nbehind for the small metacarpal bone. The inner part of the extremity\r\nhas anterior and posterior tuberosities. The distal end is divided into\r\ntwo parts by a sagittal notch. Each division bears an articular surface\r\nsimilar to that in the horse, but much smaller. The =medullary canal= is\r\ndivided into two parts by a =vertical septum= which is usually\r\nincomplete in the adult.\r\n\r\nThe =small metacarpal= bone (Mc. 5) is a rounded rod about an inch and a\r\nhalf (ca. 3.5 to 4 cm.) in length, which lies against the upper part of\r\nthe outer border of the large bone. Its upper end articulates with the\r\nlatter, but not with the carpus. The lower end is pointed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Four cartilaginous metacarpals are present in the early fœtal state,\r\n  viz., the second, third, fourth, and fifth. The second commonly either\r\n  disappears or unites with the third; sometimes it develops as a small\r\n  rod of bone. The third and fourth gradually unite, but can be cut\r\n  apart at birth. Each has three centers of ossification; the proximal\r\n  epiphysis fuses with the shaft before birth, the distal at two to two\r\n  and one-half years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFour =digits= are present in the ox. Of these, two—the third and\r\nfourth—are fully developed and have three phalanges and three sesamoids\r\neach. The second and fifth are vestiges and are placed behind the\r\nfetlock; each contains one or two small bones which do not articulate\r\nwith the rest of the skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe =first phalanges= are shorter and narrower than in the horse and are\r\nthree-sided. The interdigital surface is flattened and its posterior\r\npart bears a prominence for the attachment of the interdigital\r\nligaments. The proximal extremity is relatively large, and is somewhat\r\ncompressed from side to side. The articular surface is concave from\r\nbefore backward and is divided by a sagittal groove into two areas, of\r\nwhich the abaxial one is the larger and higher. Behind these are two\r\nfacets for articulation with the sesamoid bones. The posterior surface\r\nbears two tuberosities separated by a deep depression. The distal\r\nextremity is smaller than the proximal, especially in the\r\nantero-posterior direction. Its articular surface is divided by a\r\nsagittal groove into two convex facets, of which the abaxial one is\r\ndecidedly the larger. There are depressions on either side for\r\nligamentous attachment. The bone consists at birth of two pieces—the\r\ndistal end and the fused shaft and upper extremity. Union occurs at one\r\nand one-half to two years.\r\n\r\nThe =second phalanges= are about two-thirds of the length of the first\r\nand are distinctly three-sided. The proximal articular surface is\r\ndivided by a sagittal ridge into two glenoid cavities, of which the\r\nabaxial one is much the larger. There is a central prominence in front\r\nand two lateral tubercles behind. The distal extremity is smaller than\r\nthe proximal. Its articular surface encroaches considerably on the\r\nanterior and posterior surfaces, and is divided into two lateral parts\r\nby a groove. There is a deep depression for ligamentous attachment on\r\nthe interdigital side. The bone contains a small medullary canal. The\r\ndistal end unites with the rest of the bone about the middle of the\r\nsecond year.\r\n\r\nThe =third phalanges= resemble in a general way one-half of the bone of\r\nthe horse. Each has four surfaces. The dorsal or wall surface is marked\r\nin its lower part by a shallow groove, along which there are several\r\nforamina of considerable size; the posterior one of the series is the\r\nlargest, and conducts to a canal in the interior of the bone. Below the\r\ngroove the surface is prominent, rough, and porous. Near and on the\r\nextensor process are several relatively large foramina. The slope of the\r\nsurface is very steep posteriorly, but in front it forms an angle of 25\r\nto 30 degrees with the ground plane. The articular surface is narrow\r\nfrom side to side, and slopes downward and backward. It is also oblique\r\ntransversely, the interdigital side being the lower. It is adapted to\r\nthe distal surface of the second phalanx, with the exception of a facet\r\nbehind for the distal sesamoid. The extensor process is very rough. The\r\nvolar or sole surface is narrow and slightly concave, and presents two\r\nor three foramina of considerable size. It is separated from the wall\r\nsurface by a border which is sharp in front, rounded behind. There is no\r\nsemilunar crest, since the deep flexor tendon is attached to the thick\r\nposterior border of the sole surface. The interdigital surface is smooth\r\nand grooved below, rough and porous above. At the upper angle it is\r\nperforated by a large foramen, which is equivalent to the volar foramen\r\nof the horse and leads to a cavity in the middle of the bone. The\r\nsurface is separated by a rounded border from the wall surface, and by a\r\nsharp edge from the sole surface. The wing or angle is very short and\r\nblunt, and there is no lateral cartilage.\r\n\r\nFour =proximal sesamoids= are present, two for each digit. They are much\r\nsmaller than in the horse. The bones of each pair articulate with the\r\ncorresponding part of the distal end of the large metacarpal bone by\r\ntheir anterior surfaces, with each other and with the first phalanx by\r\nsmall facets.\r\n\r\nThe two =distal sesamoids= are short and their ends are but little\r\nnarrower than the middle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BONES OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =ilia= are almost parallel to each other and are also less oblique\r\nwith regard to the horizontal plane than in the horse. They are\r\nrelatively small. The gluteal line is prominent and is nearly parallel\r\nto the external border; it joins the superior ischiatic spine. A rounded\r\nridge separates the two parts of the ventral surface. The surface for\r\narticulation with the sacrum is triangular. The internal angle is\r\ntruncated, does not extend as high as the vertebral spines, and is\r\nseparated from the opposite angle by a wider interval than in the horse.\r\nThe external angle is relatively large and prominent; it is not so\r\noblique as in the horse, and is wide in the middle, smaller at either\r\nend. The shaft is short and compressed from side to side.\r\n\r\nThe =ischium= is large. Its long axis is directed obliquely upward and\r\nbackward, forming an angle of about 45 to 50 degrees with the horizontal\r\nplane. The transverse axis is oblique downward and inward at a similar\r\nangle, so that this part of the pelvic floor is deeply concave from side\r\nto side. The middle of the ventral surface bears a rough ridge or\r\nimprint for muscular attachment. The superior ischiatic spine is high\r\nand thin, and bears a series of almost vertical rough lines externally.\r\nThe tuber ischii is large and three-sided, bearing upper, lower, and\r\nexternal tuberosities. The ischial arch is narrow and deep. The\r\nsymphysis bears a ventral ridge, which fades out near the ischial arch.\r\n\r\nThe acetabular branch of the =pubis= is narrow, and is directed outward\r\nand a little forward. The anterior border is marked by a transverse\r\ngroove which ends below the rough ilio-pectineal eminence. The\r\nlongitudinal branch is wide and thin.\r\n\r\nThe =acetabulum= is smaller than in the horse. The rim is rounded and is\r\nusually marked by two notches. One of these is postero-internal and is\r\nnarrow and deep; it leads to the deep acetabular fossa and is commonly\r\nalmost converted into a foramen by a bar of bone. The other notch is\r\nantero-internal, small, and sometimes replaced by a foramen or absent.\r\n\r\nThe =obturator foramen= is large and elliptical. Its inner border is\r\nthin and sharp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 101.—SKELETON OF LEFT HIND LIMB OF OX, FROM MIDDLE OF THIGH\r\n    DOWNWARD, POSTERIOR VIEW. _21_, Tibia; _24_, tuber calcis; _25_,\r\n    large metatarsal bone. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =pelvic inlet= is elliptical and is more oblique than in the horse.\r\nIn a cow of medium size the =conjugate diameter= is about nine and a\r\nhalf inches (ca. 23 to 24 cm.), and the transverse about seven inches\r\n(ca. 18 cm.). The anterior end of the symphysis lies in a transverse\r\nplane through the junction of the third and fourth sacral segments. The\r\nroof is concave in both directions. The =floor= is deeply concave,\r\nparticularly in the transverse direction. The =cavity= is narrower and\r\nits =axis= is inclined strongly upward in the posterior part. The\r\ndistance between the acetabulum and the external angle of the ilium is\r\nonly a little (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) more than the distance between the former\r\nand the tuber ischii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 102.—FRONTAL SECTION OF LEFT FEMUR OF OX, FRONT VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 103.—FRONTAL SECTION OF LEFT TIBIA OF OX, ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  These figures show the internal architecture of these bones, and\r\n    especially the great extent of the medullary cavity as compared with\r\n    those of the horse (Figs. 67 and 72).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =femur= has a relatively small shaft, which is cylindrical in its\r\nmiddle, prismatic below. The trochanter minor has the form of a rough\r\ntuberosity, and is situated higher up than in the horse and encroaches\r\non the posterior surface. The trochanteric ridge (Crista\r\nintertrochanterica posterior) connects it with the trochanter major. The\r\nthird trochanter is absent. The supracondyloid (plantar) fossa is\r\nshallow. The proximal extremity is very wide. The head is smaller than\r\nin the horse and the articular surface extends considerably on the upper\r\nsurface of the neck. Instead of the notch there is a small depression on\r\nthe middle of the head for the attachment of the round ligament. The\r\nneck is well defined except above. The trochanter major is very massive\r\nand is undivided; its external surface is very rough. The trochanteric\r\nfossa is deep, but does not extend so far downward as in the horse. The\r\ndistal end presents no very striking differential features, but the lips\r\nof the trochlea are less oblique than in the horse, and converge very\r\nslightly below. The proximal extremity unites with the shaft at about\r\nthree and one-half years, the distal at three and one-half to four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe =tibia= resembles that of the horse rather closely, but is somewhat\r\nshorter. The shaft is distinctly curved, so that the inner side is\r\nconvex. The posterior surface is not divided into two areas, and the\r\nlineæ musculares are fewer and extend up higher than in the horse. The\r\narticular grooves and ridge of the distal end are almost sagittal in\r\ndirection, and present an extensive but shallow synovial fossa. The\r\nexternal groove is separated by a sharp ridge from an outer area which\r\nis for articulation with the external malleolus. The anterior part of\r\nthe internal malleolus is prolonged downward and has a pointed end. The\r\ngroove behind it is broad and well defined. Externally there is a deep\r\nnarrow groove which separates two prominences. The proximal extremity\r\nfuses with the shaft at three and one-half to four years, the distal at\r\ntwo to two and one-half years.\r\n\r\nThe =fibula= usually consists of the two extremities only. The head is\r\nfused with the external condyle of the tibia and bears a small\r\nblunt-pointed prolongation below. The distal end remains separate and\r\nforms the external malleolus (sometimes called the os malleolare). It is\r\nquadrilateral in outline and compressed from side to side. The proximal\r\nsurface articulates with the distal end of the tibia, and bears a small\r\nspine which fits into the groove on that bone. The distal surface rests\r\non the fibular tarsal, and the inner articulates with the external ridge\r\nof the tibial tarsal bone. The outer surface is rough and irregular.\r\n\r\nThe early cartilaginous fibula is complete, but later the shaft is\r\nreduced and is usually represented by a fibrous cord which connects the\r\ntwo ends. In some cases, however, the upper part undergoes partial\r\nossification, forming a slender rod which is usually united with the\r\nouter border of the tibia and is joined to the head by fibrous tissue.\r\n\r\nThe =patella= is long, narrow, and very thick. The anterior surface is\r\nstrongly convex and very rough and irregular. The articular surface is\r\nconvex from side to side and nearly straight in the vertical direction.\r\nThe large prominence on the inner side for the attachment of the\r\naccessory cartilage allows prompt determination of the side to which the\r\nbone belongs. The apex is more pointed than in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =tarsus= consists of five pieces; the central and fourth, and the\r\nsecond and third tarsal bones are fused.\r\n\r\nThe =tibial tarsal= bone is relatively long and narrow, and is somewhat\r\nflattened from before backward. It bears a trochlea at either end. The\r\ngroove and ridges of the proximal trochlea are not spiral, but almost\r\nsagittal; the outer ridge is the wider, and articulates with both tibia\r\nand fibula. The distal trochlea consists of two condyles divided by a\r\ngroove, and articulates with the combined central and fourth tarsals.\r\nThe posterior surface bears a large oval facet for articulation with the\r\nfibular tarsal; this occupies most of the surface, and is convex and\r\ngrooved from above downward. The outer surface presents two facets for\r\narticulation with the fibular tarsal, and is excavated and rough\r\nelsewhere. The inner surface bears a tuberosity at its upper part, and\r\nis flattened below.\r\n\r\nThe =fibular tarsal= bone is longer and more slender than in the horse.\r\nThe distal part of the body is compressed laterally, and bears a\r\nprojection in front which articulates with the external malleolus. The\r\ntuber calcis is marked posteriorly by a wide shallow groove, which is\r\ncoated with cartilage in the fresh state.\r\n\r\nThe =central= and =fourth tarsals= are fused to form a large bone (Os\r\ncentrotarsale quartum, scapho-cuboid), which extends across the entire\r\nwidth of the tarsus and articulates with all of the other bones. The\r\ngreater part of the upper surface is molded on the distal trochlea of\r\nthe tibial tarsal, and its inner part rises high above the rest\r\nposteriorly. Externally there is a narrow undulating surface for\r\narticulation with the distal end of the fibular tarsal bone. The\r\nposterior surface bears two tuberosities, of which the outer one is\r\nrounded, the inner more prominent and narrower.\r\n\r\nThe =first tarsal= bone is quadrilateral and small. It articulates with\r\nthe central above, the metatarsus below, and the second tarsal in front.\r\n\r\nThe =second= and =third tarsals= are fused to form a rhomboid piece. The\r\nproximal surface is concavo-convex, and articulates with the central\r\ncomponent. The distal surface is undulating and rests on the metatarsus.\r\nThe external surface bears a small facet in front for the fourth tarsal\r\ncomponent, and the posterior surface a very small one for the first\r\ntarsal bone.\r\n\r\nThe =large metatarsal= bone is about one-seventh (ca. 3 cm.) longer than\r\nthe corresponding metacarpal. Its shaft is compressed laterally and is\r\ndistinctly four-sided. The groove on the anterior surface is deep and\r\nwide. The posterior surface is marked by variable grooves. The upper\r\nforamen on this surface does not perforate the shaft, but passes\r\nobliquely through the extremity, opening on the posterior part of its\r\nproximal surface. The postero-internal angle of the proximal end bears a\r\nfacet for articulation with the small metatarsal bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 104.—SKELETON OF DISTAL PART OF LEFT HIND LIMB OF OX, INTERNAL\r\n    VIEW. _24_, Tuber calcis; _25_, large metatarsal bone; _30_, first\r\n    phalanx; _31_, second phalanx; _32_, third phalanx. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =small metatarsal= bone is a quadrilateral disc a little less than\r\nan inch in width and height. Its anterior face bears a facet for\r\narticulation with the large metatarsal bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The large metatarsal bone is usually regarded as consisting of the\r\n  fused third and fourth metatarsal bones. The medullary cavity is\r\n  subdivided like that of the large metacarpal bone. Some anatomists,\r\n  however, consider that the ridges at the upper end of each border\r\n  represent the second and fifth metatarsals (Rosenberg and Retterer).\r\n  On this basis the small bone would be the first metatarsal.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =phalanges= and =sesamoids= resemble those of the thoracic limb so\r\nclosely as to render separate description unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SKELETON OF THE PIG\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VERTEBRAL COLUMN\r\n\r\nThe =vertebral formula= is C_{7}T_{14–15}L_{6–7}S_{4}Cy_{20–23}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 105.—SKELETON OF PIG, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Cranium; _b_, upper jaw; _c_, lower jaw; _1H.-7H._, cervical\r\n    vertebræ; _1R.w._, first thoracic vertebra; _13 R.w._, thirteenth\r\n    thoracic vertebra (next to last); _1L._, first lumbar vertebra;\r\n    _6L._, sixth lumbar vertebra (next to last usually); _K._, sacrum;\r\n    _S._, coccygeal vertebra; _1R._, first rib; _14R._, last rib;\r\n    _R.kn._, costal cartilages; _St._, sternum; _d_, supraspinous fossa\r\n    of scapula; _d′_, infraspinous fossa; _1_, spine of scapula; _2_,\r\n    neck of scapula; _e_, humerus; _3_, head of humerus; _4_,\r\n    tuberosities of humerus; _5_, deltoid tuberosity; _6_, external\r\n    epicondyle of humerus; _f_, radius; _g_, ulna; _7_, olecranon; _h_,\r\n    carpus; _18–25_, carpal bones; _i-i⁗_, metacarpus; _k-k⁗_, proximal\r\n    phalanges; _l-l⁗_, middle phalanges; _m-m⁗_, distal phalanges; _n_,\r\n    _o_, sesamoids; _p_, ilium; _8_, external angle of ilium (tuber\r\n    coxæ); _9_, internal angle of ilium (tuber sacrale); _10_, superior\r\n    ischiatic spine; _q_, ischium; _11_, tuber ischii; _r_, pubis; _12_,\r\n    acetabulum; _s_, femur; _13_, trochanter major; _14_, trochanter\r\n    minor; _15_, external epicondyle; _t_, patella; _u_, tibia; _16_,\r\n    crest of tibia; _17_, external condyle of tibia; _v_, fibula; _w_,\r\n    tarsus; _26–31_, tarsal bones; _26′_, tuber calcis. (After\r\n    Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =cervical vertebræ= are short and wide. The bodies are elliptical in\r\ncross-section, the long diameter being transverse. The anterior\r\narticular surfaces are slightly convex from side to side and concave\r\ndorso-ventrally; the posterior ones are slightly concave. A ventral\r\ncrest is not present. The arches are wide from side to side, but the\r\nlaminæ are narrow, so that a considerable interval (Spatium\r\ninterarcuale) separates adjacent arches dorsally. The pedicles are\r\nperforated by a foramen on either side in addition to the usual\r\nintervertebral foramina. The transverse processes divide into two\r\nbranches, both of which increase in size from the third to the sixth.\r\nThe upper branch projects outward and backward; it is short and is\r\nthickened at its free end. The lower branch is a quadrilateral plate\r\ndirected ventrally; each overlaps the succeeding one to a small extent,\r\nand the series forms the lateral boundary of a deep and wide groove\r\nbeneath the bodies. The spines increase in height from the third to the\r\nlast; the anterior ones are inclined backward, the posterior ones\r\nforward. The last cervical is recognized by the great length of its\r\nspine (ca. 10 cm. in the adult), the absence of the ventral plate of the\r\ntransverse process, and the flatness of the body, which bears a pair of\r\nsmall facets on its posterior margin for the heads of the first ribs. It\r\nhas foramina transversaria, and usually two foramina in either side of\r\nthe arch.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal arch of the =atlas= bears a large tuberosity. The ventral\r\ntubercle is long, compressed laterally, and projects back under the\r\naxis. The wing is flattened and bears a posterior tuberosity. The\r\nforamen transversarium passes through the posterior border of the wing\r\nto the fossa under the latter, and is not visible dorsally; it is\r\nsometimes very small or absent. The sides of the vertebral foramen bear\r\ntwo lateral projections which partially divide it into a ventral narrow\r\npart, which receives the odontoid process, and a dorsal larger part for\r\nthe spinal cord. In the fresh state the division is completed by the\r\ntransverse ligament, which is attached to the projections.\r\n\r\nThe =axis= has a large spinous process, which is directed upward and\r\nbackward. The odontoid process is a thick cylindrical rod. The\r\ntransverse process is very small and the foramen transversarium is often\r\nincomplete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 106.—ATLAS OF PIG, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Wing; _b_, ventral tubercle; _c_, foramen transversarium; _d_,\r\n    alar foramen; _e_, intervertebral foramen; _f_, dorsal tuberosity;\r\n    _g_, articular surface corresponding to that of posterior articular\r\n    process of typical vertebra; _h_, facet on ventral arch for odontoid\r\n    process.

Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic vertebræ= are often fifteen in number. Their bodies are\r\nrelatively long, constricted in the middle, and without ventral crests.\r\nTheir extremities are elliptical, depressed in the middle and prominent\r\nat the periphery. The arch is perforated by a foramen on either side,\r\nand in most of the series there is also a foramen in the posterior part\r\nof the root of the transverse process which communicates with the former\r\nor with the posterior intervertebral foramen. Sometimes there is a\r\nforamen in the anterior part of the process also. There are mammillary\r\nprocesses except on the first two; in the posterior five or six vertebræ\r\nthey project from the anterior articular processes. The facet for the\r\ntubercle of the rib is absent or fused with that for the head in the\r\nlast five or six. The last transverse process is lumbar in character,\r\nplate-like, and about an inch (2 cm.) long. Small accessory processes\r\noccur in the posterior part of the region. The first spinous process is\r\nbroad, very high, and inclined a little forward. The others diminish\r\nvery gradually in length to the tenth, beyond which they are about\r\nequal. The second to the ninth are inclined backward, the tenth is\r\nvertical (anticlinal), and the rest incline forward. The width decreases\r\ndecidedly from the fourth to the tenth, beyond which there is a gradual\r\nincrease. The summits are slightly enlarged and lie almost in a straight\r\nline.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The occurrence of fifteen thoracic vertebræ appears to be quite\r\n  common, and some observers have recorded the existence of sixteen and\r\n  even seventeen; a reduction to thirteen is rare.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =lumbar vertebræ= are six or seven in number. The bodies are longer\r\nthan in the thoracic region and bear a ventral crest. They become wider\r\nand flatter in the posterior part of the series. The arches are deeply\r\nnotched, and are separated by an increasing space dorsally. The\r\nmammillary processes project outward and backward. The transverse\r\nprocesses are bent downward and incline a little forward. Their length\r\nincreases to the fifth and is much diminished in the last. They form no\r\narticulation with each other or with the sacrum. The posterior edge of\r\nthe root of the process is marked by a notch in the anterior part of the\r\nseries, a foramen in the posterior part. The spines are broad and\r\nincline forward, with the exception of the last, which is narrow and\r\nvertical.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lesbre states that six and seven lumbar vertebræ occur with almost\r\n  equal frequency. The number may be reduced to five, and the number of\r\n  presacral vertebræ varies from twenty-six to twenty-nine.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =sacrum= consists usually of four vertebræ, which fuse later and\r\nless completely than in the other domesticated animals. It is less\r\ncurved than in the ox. The spines are absent, excepting small rudiments\r\non the last two segments. The middle of the dorsal surface is flattened\r\nand smooth, and presents openings into the sacral canal between adjacent\r\narches (Spatia interarcualia). On either side are the superior sacral\r\nforamina, and tubercles which indicate the fused articular processes.\r\nThe wings resemble those of the ox. The anterior articular processes are\r\nvery large. The pelvic surface resembles that of the ox, but is not so\r\nstrongly curved, and the transverse lines are very distinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 108.—SACRUM OF PIG, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Wing; _b_, dorsal sacral foramina; _c_, articular process; _1–4_,\r\n    segments or sacral vertebræ. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =coccygeal vertebræ= are specially characterized by the presence of\r\nfunctional articular processes on the first four or five, beyond which\r\nthese processes become non-articular and smaller. The arches of the\r\nfirst five or six are complete. The transverse processes are broad and\r\nplate-like in the anterior part of the series and diminish very\r\ngradually.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The numerical variation here is twenty to twenty-six according to the\r\n  observation of several anatomists. Lesbre states that he has found\r\n  twenty-three most frequently.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Curves.=—The cervical region is practically straight. The thoracic and\r\nlumbar regions form a gentle curve, concave ventrally, the highest point\r\nof which is at the junction of the two regions. The sacral promontory is\r\nnot so pronounced as in the ox, and the sacral curve is flatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE RIBS\r\n\r\nThe =ribs= number fourteen or fifteen pairs, of which seven are sternal\r\nand seven or eight asternal usually. They are in general strongly curved\r\nin the improved breeds, so that there is a fairly distinct angle, except\r\ntoward the end of the series. The backward slope of the posterior ribs\r\nis slight. The first rib is prismatic, has a large sternal end, and a\r\nvery short cartilage. The width is greatest in the third to the sixth,\r\nand the length in the sixth and seventh usually. The tuberosity fuses\r\nwith the head on the last five or six. The second to the fifth form\r\ndiarthrodial joints with their cartilages, which are wide and\r\nplate-like.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE STERNUM\r\n\r\nThe =sternum= consists of six segments and resembles that of the ox in\r\ngeneral form. The first segment (Manubrium) is long, flattened\r\nlaterally, and bears a blunt-pointed cartilage on its anterior end; its\r\nposterior end forms a diarthrodial joint with the body. The latter is\r\nflattened, wide in its middle, narrow at either end. The widest segments\r\nare formed of two lateral parts, which are not completely fused in the\r\nadult. The last segment has a long narrow part which bears the xiphoid\r\ncartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =thorax= is long and is more barrel-shaped than in the horse or ox,\r\nsince the ribs are more strongly curved and differ less in relative\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 109.—SKULL OF PIG, LATERAL VIEW WITHOUT MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Occipital condyle; _2_, paramastoid or styloid process; _3_,\r\n    bulla ossea; _4_, external auditory meatus, _5_, zygomatic process\r\n    of temporal bone; _6_, sphenoid bone; _7_, orbital opening of\r\n    supraorbital canal; _8_, malar bone; _9_, pterygoid bone; _10_,\r\n    pterygoid process of sphenoid; _11_, pterygoid process of palate\r\n    bone; _I1–3_, incisor teeth; _C_, canine tooth; _P1–4_, premolars;\r\n    _M1–3_, molars.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BONES OF THE SKULL\r\n\r\nCRANIUM\r\n\r\nThe =occipital bone= has an extensive squamous part or supraoccipital,\r\nwhich forms a very broad and prominent crest. The latter is concave, and\r\nis thick and rough above, where it forms the highest part of the skull;\r\nlaterally it becomes thinner, turns downward, and is continuous with the\r\ntemporal crest. Two divergent ridges pass upward from the foramen\r\nmagnum, and the surface between them is concave and smooth. The greater\r\npart of the inner (or anterior) surface of the supraoccipital is united\r\nwith the parietal bones, but a lower concave area faces into the cranial\r\ncavity. The foramen magnum is almost triangular, and is narrow above,\r\nwhere it is flanked by two small tuberosities. The paramastoid processes\r\nare extremely long and project almost straight downward. The hypoglossal\r\nforamen is at the inner side of the root of the process. The basilar\r\npart is short and wide; its lower surface bears a thin median ridge and\r\ntwo lateral imprints or tubercles which converge at the junction with\r\nthe sphenoid bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 110.—SKULL OF PIG, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =interparietal= fuses before birth with the occipital. The tentorium\r\nosseum is absent.\r\n\r\nThe =parietal= is overlapped by the occipital bone behind and concurs in\r\nthe formation of the occipital crest. Its external surface is divided by\r\nthe parietal crest into two parts. The inner part (Planum parietale)\r\nfaces upward and forward, and is flattened and smooth. Its inner border\r\nis short and straight and unites early with the opposite bone. Its\r\nanterior border is concave and joins the frontal bone. The outer part\r\n(Planum temporale) faces outward and is more extensive; it is concave,\r\nforms a large part of the temporal fossa, and is overlapped below by the\r\nsquamous temporal. The parietal crest extends in a curve from the\r\noccipital crest forward and outward to the supraorbital process. The\r\ninternal surface is concave and is marked by digital impressions. The\r\nlower border projects into the cranial cavity and forms a crest which\r\nseparates the cerebral and cerebellar compartments laterally. The\r\ninterior forms part of the frontal sinus in the adult. There is no\r\nparieto-temporal canal.\r\n\r\nThe =frontal bone= is long. The frontal surface slopes downward and\r\nforward, the inclination varying in different subjects. The anterior\r\npart is concave and is marked by the supraorbital foramen and the groove\r\nleading forward from the foramen to the nasal bone. The supraorbital\r\ncanal opens into the orbit at the upper part of the inner wall of the\r\nlatter. The supraorbital process is short and blunt-pointed, and is not\r\nconnected with the zygomatic arch. The gap in the orbital margin is\r\nclosed by the orbital ligament in the fresh state. The orbital part is\r\nextensive and forms the greater part of the inner wall of the orbit. Its\r\nupper part is perforated by the orbital orifice of the supraorbital\r\ncanal, in front of which is the distinct fovea trochlearis. The\r\nethmoidal or internal orbital foramen is situated in the lower part near\r\nthe junction with the orbital wing of the sphenoid. The temporal part is\r\nvery narrow and is separated from the orbital plate by a ridge which\r\njoins the pterygoid crest below. The interior of the bone is excavated\r\nby the frontal sinus in practically its entire extent in the adult. In\r\nthe young subject the cavity is confined to the anterior part and the\r\nrest of the bone is thick.\r\n\r\nThe =temporal bone= has a general resemblance to that of the ox. The\r\nzygomatic process is short and stout and is bent at a right angle. The\r\nupper border of the process is thin; traced from before backward it\r\ncurves sharply upward and forms a high prominence in front of the\r\nexternal auditory meatus; beyond this it drops rather abruptly and is\r\nthen continued upward to the occipital crest. The anterior part of the\r\nlower border joins the zygomatic process of the malar, which is deeply\r\nnotched. The condyle is concave in the transverse direction. The\r\npostglenoid process is absent, but the articular surface is bounded\r\nbehind and internally by a crest. There is no parieto-temporal canal.\r\nThe external auditory canal is very long and is directed upward and\r\noutward. The bulla ossea is large, compressed laterally, and bears a\r\npointed muscular process in front. A narrow space intervenes between the\r\nbulla and the basilar part of the occipital bone, so that the foramen\r\nlacerum resembles that of the horse. The small hyoid process is situated\r\nin a deep depression in front of the root of the paramastoid process,\r\nand the stylo-mastoid foramen is immediately external to it. The petrous\r\npart presents no important differential features. The squamous part\r\n(including the root of the zygomatic process) contains an air-cavity,\r\nwhich is continuous with the sphenoidal sinus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 111.—BASAL SURFACE OF SKULL OF YOUNG PIG, WITHOUT THE MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\n  _Sq.o._, Supraoccipital; _E.o._, exoccipital; _B.o._, basioccipital;\r\n    _B.s._, body of sphenoid; _Sq._, squamous temporal bone; _V_, vomer;\r\n    _Mx._, maxilla; _Pa._, horizontal part of palate bone; _P.p._,\r\n    palate process of maxilla; _Z_, malar bone; _J_, premaxilla; _D.c._,\r\n    canine tooth; _J1–3_, incisor teeth; _O_, temporal fossa; _1_,\r\n    occipital crest; _2_, for. magnum; _3_, occipital condyle; _4_,\r\n    paramastoid (styloid) process; _5_, bulla ossea; _6_, for. lacerum\r\n    basis cranii; _7_, pterygoid process of sphenoid; _8_, posterior\r\n    nares; _9_, anterior palatine foramen; _10_, palatine cleft.\r\n    (Struska, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =sphenoid bone= is short and resembles that of the ox in general.\r\nThe body is narrow. The pituitary fossa is very deep, and is limited\r\nbehind by a prominent dorsum sellæ; the dorsum bears lateral\r\nprojections, the =posterior clinoid processes=. The foramen ovale is\r\nabsent, being included in the foramen lacerum anterius. The other\r\nforamina are like those of the ox. The pterygoid process is broad and\r\ntwisted. Its base is not perforated and its free edge is thin and sharp.\r\nIt concurs with the pterygoid and palate bones in the formation of the\r\npterygoid fossa, which opens backward and is not present in the horse or\r\nox. The sphenoidal sinus is very large and occupies the body, the\r\ntemporal wings, and a great part of the pterygoid processes in the\r\nadult; it is continued into the temporal bone as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nThe =ethmoid bone= has a relatively long perpendicular plate, which is\r\nmarked by ridges corresponding to the ethmoidal meatuses. The cribriform\r\nplate is extensive and very oblique, so that it and the crista galli are\r\nalmost in line with the basi-cranial axis. A linear series of relatively\r\nlarge foramina is found on either side of the crista. The lateral mass\r\nconsists of five endoturbinals and eighteen ectoturbinals (Paulli). The\r\nlamina papyracea concurs in the formation of the pterygo-palatine fossa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  FACE\r\n\r\nThe =maxilla= is extensive. Its external surface forms a longitudinal\r\ngroove, which is continued upon the premaxilla in front and the facial\r\nparts of the lacrimal and malar behind. The infraorbital\r\nforamen—sometimes double—is large and is situated above the third or\r\nfourth cheek tooth. The alveolus for the canine tooth produces a ridge\r\nat the anterior end which is very pronounced in the boar. The facial\r\ncrest extends forward from the root of the zygomatic process and fades\r\nout behind the infraorbital foramen; in some specimens it is prominent\r\nand thin-edged, in others it is rounded and projects little. The\r\nzygomatic process is short but stout and buttress-like; it is overlapped\r\nexternally by the malar. The maxillary tuberosity forms in the young\r\nsubject a long bulla, which occupies most of the pterygo-palatine fossa\r\nand contains the developing permanent molars; after the eruption of the\r\nteeth the tuberosity flattens and joins the vertical part of the palate\r\nbone. The palatine process is very long and is marked in its anterior\r\npart by transverse ridges corresponding with those of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the palate. The anterior palatine foramen is near the\r\njunction with the palate bone; from it the palatine groove can be traced\r\ndistinctly along the entire length of the process. The alveolar border\r\npresents a large alveolus for the canine tooth at its anterior end;\r\nbehind this are seven alveoli for the cheek teeth, which increase in\r\nsize from first to last. The maxillary foramen and infraorbital canal\r\nare very large. The maxillary sinus is small.\r\n\r\nThe body of the =premaxilla= is narrow and prismatic. It presents three\r\nalveoli for the incisor teeth, which are separated by short intervals\r\nand diminish in size from before backward. As in the ox, a narrow space\r\nseparates the right and left bones and takes the place of the foramen\r\nincisivum. The palatine process is long and narrow. The nasal process is\r\nvery extensive and is somewhat rhomboid in outline. Its upper border\r\nforms a very long suture with the nasal bone, and the lower articulates\r\nto about the same extent with the maxilla. The palatine fissure is\r\nrelatively wide.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal part of the =palate bone= forms a fourth to a fifth of\r\nthe length of the palate; its palatine surface is triangular, the apex\r\nbeing anterior; its nasal surface is deeply grooved and smooth. A\r\npterygoid process (processus pyramidalis of man) projects backward and\r\ndownward, and its thick rounded end is received between the pterygoid\r\nprocess of the sphenoid and the pterygoid bone. The perpendicular part\r\nis largely overlapped externally by the maxilla and concurs in forming\r\npart of the palatine canal. Superiorly the two plates separate and\r\ninclose an air-cavity which opens into an ethmoidal meatus. The inner\r\nplate curves inward and unites with the vomer and ethmoid to form a\r\nhorizontal plate (Lamina transversalis), which divides the posterior\r\npart of the nasal cavity into an upper olfactory part and a lower\r\nrespiratory part.\r\n\r\nThe =pterygoid bone= is nearly vertical in direction, and is narrow in\r\nits middle, wide at each end. The external surface is free below and\r\nforms the inner wall of the pterygoid fossa. The lower end is notched\r\nand forms a distinct hamulus.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal bone= is very long and its width is almost uniform, except at\r\nthe anterior end, which is pointed and reaches almost as far forward as\r\nthe premaxilla. The facial surface is flattened from side to side. In\r\nprofile it is nearly straight in some subjects, variably concave in\r\nothers. The external border is free to a small extent in front only;\r\notherwise it is firmly connected with the premaxilla and maxilla. In the\r\nadult the frontal sinus extends into the posterior part of the bone.\r\n\r\nThe =lacrimal bone= is very sharply bent. Its facial surface presents a\r\ndeep depression, surmounted by a ridge or tubercle. On or close to the\r\norbital margin are two lacrimal foramina which lead to the lacrimal\r\ncanals. The orbital surface presents a fossa in which the inferior\r\noblique muscle of the eyeball arises, and its lower part bears a crest,\r\nwhich is crossed obliquely by a vascular furrow. The upper border\r\narticulates with the frontal only. The bone concurs in the formation of\r\nthe maxillary sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =malar bone= is strongly compressed from side to side. Its facial\r\nsurface is small and presents a fossa which is continuous with the\r\ndepressions of the maxilla and lacrimal. The orbital surface is still\r\nsmaller and is smooth and deeply grooved. The zygomatic process is very\r\nextensive, especially in the vertical direction. Its external surface is\r\nconvex and free, and bears a rough eminence in its middle. Its internal\r\nsurface is concave; it is overlapped in front by the maxilla, and in the\r\nremainder of its extent is free and smooth. The upper border is thick\r\nand rounded in front, where it forms the lower part of the orbital\r\nmargin; behind this it forms an extensive notch which receives the\r\nzygomatic process of the temporal. (It might be regarded as dividing\r\ninto frontal and temporal branches.) The lower border is convex and\r\nbecomes thinner behind.\r\n\r\nThe =turbinal bones= resemble those of the ox. The superior turbinal is,\r\nhowever, relatively longer, less fragile, and more firmly attached to\r\nthe nasal bone. There is no middle turbinal.\r\n\r\nThe =vomer= is very long. The anterior extremity reaches to the body of\r\nthe premaxilla or very close to it. The lower border is received into a\r\ngroove formed by the nasal crest of the maxillæ and palate bones and in\r\nfront by the palatine processes of the premaxillæ. The posterior border\r\nis concave, thin, and sharp.\r\n\r\nThe =os rostri= (or prenasal bone) is situated in the snout between the\r\nnostrils. It has the form of a short three-sided prism. The upper\r\nsurface is convex and is notched at each end. The lateral surfaces are\r\nconcave, smooth, and converge below, forming a grooved lower border. The\r\nposterior surface is triangular, notched centrally, and rough laterally.\r\nThe anterior surface is deeply pitted and is surrounded by an irregular\r\nsharp border.\r\n\r\nThe =mandible= is very strong, and differs very much from that of the\r\nhorse or ox. The body narrows decidedly in front; the lingual surface is\r\ndeeply concave; the mental surface is strongly convex, slopes downward\r\nand backward, and forms a distinct prominence at the point of divergence\r\nof the rami. Above this prominence is a pair of foramina. The alveolar\r\nborder presents six alveoli for the incisor teeth, and a little further\r\nback two large cavities for the canine teeth. There are two pairs of\r\nmental foramina of considerable size and a variable number of smaller\r\nones. The rami diverge more than in the horse or ox, and the upper part\r\nis somewhat incurved. The horizontal part is very thick and strong. Its\r\nouter surface is strongly convex from above downward. The inner surface\r\nis prominent over the roots of the molar teeth and overhangs the concave\r\nlower part. The alveolar border is thin in front and widens behind; it\r\ndoes not follow the axis of the ramus, but runs nearly straight and\r\nproduces the marked overhang noted above. There are seven alveoli for\r\nthe lower cheek teeth, which increase in size from before backward. The\r\nfirst is small, not always present in the adult, and is separated by\r\nshort spaces from the second and the canine alveolus. The vertical part\r\nis relatively wide above. The condyle is convex in both directions, wide\r\nin front, narrow and declivitous behind. The very small and thin-edged\r\ncoronoid process is not quite so high as the condyle, from which it is\r\nseparated by a very wide notch. The mandibular foramen is large. The two\r\nhalves of the bone unite soon after birth in the improved breeds.\r\n\r\nThe body of the =hyoid bone= is broad from before backward, short\r\ntransversely, and bears on its ventral aspect a very short pointed\r\nlingual process. The thyroid cornua are wide and curved, concave and\r\ngrooved dorsally; their ends are attached to the thyroid cartilage of\r\nthe larynx by rather long bars of cartilage. The small cornua are short,\r\nwide, and flattened dorso-ventrally; they are attached to short bars\r\nwhich project from the junction of the body and thyroid cornua. The\r\nmiddle cornu is a little longer than the small cornu, but is relatively\r\nslender; it is largely cartilaginous in the young subject and does not\r\nossify at either end. The great cornu is a very slender rod, slightly\r\nenlarged at either end; the upper extremity is attached to the hyoid\r\nprocess of the temporal by a rather long and wide bar of cartilage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 112.—MANDIBLE OF PIG.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Body of mandible; _b_, horizontal part of ramus; _f_, vertical\r\n    part of ramus; _c_, interalveolar border; _c′_, interval between\r\n    canine and corner incisor; _c″_, interval between first and second\r\n    premolars; _d_, mental foramina; _e_, vascular impression; _g_,\r\n    coronoid process; _h_, condyle; _i_, sigmoid notch; _k_, mandibular\r\n    foramen; _1–7_, cheek teeth, _8_, canine tooth; _9_, _10_, _11_,\r\n    incisors. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SKULL AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\nThe =length= and the =profile= contour vary greatly in different\r\nsubjects. Primitively the skull is long—especially in its facial\r\npart—and the frontal profile is almost straight. The condition is very\r\npronounced in wild or semi-feral pigs, and exists also in the improved\r\nbreeds during extreme youth. Most of the latter are decidedly\r\nbrachycephalic when fully developed; the face is “dished” in a\r\npronounced fashion. The frontal region slopes sharply upward, and the\r\nnasal region is shortened, and in some specimens even distinctly concave\r\nin profile. The supraorbital foramina are about midway between the\r\norbital margin and the frontal suture. The supraorbital grooves extend\r\nforward from the foramina to the nasal region and turn outward and\r\ndownward toward the infraorbital foramina over the ridges which separate\r\nthe nasal and lateral regions.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral surface= is triangular when the mandible is included. The\r\ntemporal fossa is entirely lateral and its long axis is almost vertical.\r\nIt is bounded above by the occipital crest, behind by the temporal\r\ncrest, in front by the parietal crest, and is marked off from the\r\norbital cavity by the supraorbital process and a curved crest which\r\nextends from it to the root of the pterygoid process. The zygomatic arch\r\nis strong, high, and flattened from side to side. Its root is notched\r\nabove and bears a projection below. It curves sharply upward behind and\r\nforms a pointed recurved projection above and in front of the external\r\nauditory meatus. The orbit is small. Its margin is deficient behind in\r\nthe dry skull, thick and rounded in front and below. The cavity is\r\nlimited below by a ridge on the frontal and lacrimal bones, and is\r\nseparated by a crest from the temporal fossa. The inner wall is\r\nperforated above by the orbital opening of the supraorbital canal, and\r\nbelow by the optic and ethmoidal foramina; on its antero-inferior part\r\nis the fossa in which the inferior oblique muscle of the eye takes\r\norigin. Two lacrimal foramina are found on or close to the anterior\r\nmargin. The pterygo-palatine fossa is well defined; its upper part forms\r\na deep groove which leads from the large foramen in the sphenoid (like\r\nthat of the ox) to the very large maxillary foramen. The preorbital\r\nregion is deeply grooved in its length and is clearly marked off by a\r\nridge from the nasal and frontal regions. The facial crest is short,\r\nusually thin-edged, and lies above the fifth and sixth cheek teeth. A\r\nlittle (ca. 2 cm.) in front of it is the infraorbital foramen. There is\r\na ridged prominence over the canine alveolus. In some skulls the\r\nanterior part of the upper jaw is inclined upward.\r\n\r\nThe most striking features of the =basal surface= are as follows: The\r\nparamastoid processes are extremely long, less flattened than in the\r\nhorse and ox, and nearly vertical. At the inner side of the root of each\r\nis the hypoglossal foramen, and in front of it are the stylo-mastoid\r\nforamen and a deep cavity in which the hyoid process is concealed. The\r\nbulla ossea is long, compressed laterally, and bears a sharp, short,\r\nmuscular process. The basioccipital is wide and flattened; it bears a\r\nmedian crest and two lateral tubercles. The posterior nares are small\r\nand are wider below than above. On either side of them is the tuberosity\r\nof the palate bone, and above this is the pterygoid fossa. The palate is\r\nremarkably long and is relatively narrow. It constitutes about\r\ntwo-thirds of the entire length of the skull. It is widest between the\r\ncanines and premolars and narrow at each end. It is marked by a crest\r\nmedially and by the palatine foramen and groove laterally. The anterior\r\npart bears transverse ridges. It is moderately arched from side to side.\r\nIn some specimens it is nearly straight or slightly concave in its\r\nlength; in others it curves upward to a variable degree in front. The\r\nposterior end always slopes upward more or less.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =nuchal surface= is remarkable for its height and the\r\nbreadth of the occipital crest. The central part above the foramen\r\nmagnum is smooth and concave from side to side, and is bounded laterally\r\nby ridges, which converge below and end on two tubercles at the upper\r\nmargin of the foramen magnum. The surface is separated from the temporal\r\nfossæ by the temporal crests, which curve downward and outward and blend\r\nwith the external auditory canals. The mastoid process has the form of a\r\nplate which overlaps the root of the paramastoid process and bears a\r\ncrest on its anterior part.\r\n\r\nThe =cranial cavity= is small, in spite of the great size of the\r\ncranium; the discrepancy is due to the enormous development of the\r\nfrontal sinuses in the adult. It is relatively longer, but much lower\r\nthan that of the ox. Its width is greatly diminished between the orbits.\r\nThe olfactory fossæ are extensive and very oblique. The floor resembles\r\nthat of the ox, but the foramen ovale is absent, the dorsum sellæ is\r\nmore developed, and the foramen lacerum basis cranii is like that of the\r\nhorse. Two oblique lateral crests clearly mark the limit between the\r\ncerebral and cerebellar compartments. The tentorium osseum and the\r\nparieto-temporal canals are absent.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal cavity= is very long. Its posterior part is divided by a\r\nhorizontal plate into olfactory and respiratory parts. The olfactory\r\npart or fundus is above, and contains the ethmoturbinals and ethmoidal\r\nmeatuses. The lower part is continuous with the inferior meatus and\r\nleads to the pharyngeal orifice; hence it is sometimes called the\r\nnaso-pharyngeal meatus. The bony roof is almost complete in front on\r\naccount of the great length of the nasal bones.\r\n\r\nThe =frontal sinus= is a vast excavation in the adult animal. It\r\ninvolves all of the roof and almost all of the sides of the cranium, and\r\nextends forward into the roof of the nasal cavity a variable\r\ndistance—sometimes as far as a transverse plane through the infraorbital\r\nforamina. The septum between the right and left sinuses is usually\r\ndeflected in an irregular manner in its middle part, but is practically\r\nmedian at either end. Each sinus is subdivided by numerous septa, some\r\nof which are complete. Thus the sinus is divided into compartments, each\r\nof which communicates with an ethmoidal meatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the young pig the sinus is small and is confined to the anterior\r\n  part of the frontal bone. Later it extends backward, outward, and to a\r\n  less extent forward. In the old subject it penetrates laterally into\r\n  the supraorbital process and the root of the zygomatic process of the\r\n  temporal bone, and behind almost down to the foramen magnum and the\r\n  occipital condyles. It then consists of six to eight compartments\r\n  usually.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =maxillary sinus= is relatively small. Its anterior end is a little\r\nless than an inch (ca. 2 cm.) behind the infraorbital foramen, and it\r\nextends upward into the lacrimal and backward into the malar bone. The\r\ninfraorbital canal passes along its floor, and the roots of the molar\r\nteeth do not project up into it. It does not communicate with the\r\nfrontal and sphenoidal sinuses, but with the posterior part of the\r\nmiddle meatus by means of a considerable orifice.\r\n\r\nThe =sphenoidal sinus= is very large. It involves the body, pterygoid\r\nprocesses, and temporal wings of the sphenoid bone, and extends into the\r\nsquamous temporal. It communicates with the ventral ethmoidal meatus.\r\n\r\nThere is a small sinus in the perpendicular part of the palate bone\r\nwhich communicates with an ethmoidal meatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       BONES OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =scapula= is very wide, the index being about 1 ∶ 0.7. The spine is\r\ntriangular and is very wide in its middle, which curves backward over\r\nthe infraspinous fossa and bears a large tuberosity. Its lower part\r\nbears a small projection (rudimentary acromion). The anterior border is\r\nstrongly convex in profile, sinuous when viewed from the front, and\r\nthick and rough in its middle. The posterior border is wide, slightly\r\nconcave, and bears an outer rough lip. The vertebral border is convex,\r\nand the cartilage is not so extensive as in the horse and ox. The\r\ncervical angle is thin and bent inward a little. The dorsal angle is\r\nthick and is about a right angle. The neck is well defined. The rim of\r\nthe glenoid cavity is rounded and not notched. The tuberosity is just\r\nabove the antero-internal part of the glenoid cavity and bears no\r\ndistinct coracoid process.\r\n\r\nThe =humerus= has an appearance in profile somewhat like an italic _f_\r\nminus the cross-bar; this is due to the marked backward and forward\r\ninclination of the proximal and distal ends respectively. The shaft is\r\ndecidedly compressed from side to side. The internal surface is\r\nextensive and flattened; it is separated from the anterior surface by a\r\ndistinct border, and bears no teres tubercle. The musculo-spiral groove\r\nis shallow. The deltoid tuberosity is small, and there is a larger\r\nrounded eminence midway between it and the external tuberosity. The\r\nnutrient foramen is on the posterior surface below its middle. The head\r\nis more strongly curved and the neck better marked than in the horse or\r\nox. The external tuberosity is very large and extends upon the front of\r\nthe extremity. It is divided into two high prominences by a wide deep\r\ngroove. There is a third eminence below and externally for the\r\nattachment of the supraspinatus muscle. The bicipital groove is at the\r\nfront of the inner side; it is undivided and is almost converted into a\r\ncanal. The outer groove on the distal articular surface is so shallow as\r\nto give the appearance of two condyles of similar size. The olecranon\r\nfossa is very deep, and the plate of bone which separates it from the\r\ncoronoid fossa is thin and sometimes perforated. The proximal end unites\r\nwith the shaft at three and a half years, the distal at one year.\r\n\r\nThe =radius= is short and narrow, but thick. The shaft increases in size\r\nfrom above downward. The greater part of the posterior surface is in\r\napposition with the ulna; this part is marked by a vascular furrow which\r\nruns downward from the upper interosseous space, and has the nutrient\r\nforamen at its proximal end. The bicipital tuberosity is represented by\r\na rough area. The distal end is relatively large. Its carpal surface\r\nconsists of concavo-convex facets for the radial and intermediate carpal\r\nbones. There is a wide shallow groove on the middle of the front. The\r\nproximal end fuses with the shaft at one year, the distal at three and a\r\nhalf years.\r\n\r\nThe =ulna= is massive. It is much longer and considerably heavier than\r\nthe radius. The shaft is curved. The anterior surface is convex and most\r\nof it is rough and attached to the radius by the interosseous ligament.\r\nThere is a smooth area on the upper third, which concurs with the radius\r\nin forming the upper interosseous space, and is marked in its upper part\r\nby the nutrient foramen. From this space a vascular furrow passes\r\ndownward to the lower part of the shaft, where there is often a distal\r\ninterosseous space for the passage of vessels. The internal surface is\r\nextensive, concave, and smooth. The external surface is slightly convex,\r\nand its upper part is marked by an oblique rough line or ridge. The\r\nproximal extremity is large and is bent inward somewhat; its length is\r\nmore than one-third of that of the entire bone. The distal extremity is\r\nrelatively small; it articulates with the ulnar and accessory carpal\r\nbones, and is notched in front to accommodate the ridge on the radius.\r\nThe bone contains a considerable medullary canal. The bone is\r\nconsolidated at three to three and a half years.\r\n\r\nThe =carpus= comprises eight bones, four in each row. The bones of the\r\nproximal row resemble those of the ox, with the exception of the\r\naccessory, which is more like that of the horse, but has no external\r\ngroove. The first carpal is small, elongated from before backward,\r\nrounded, and articulates in front with the second carpal. The latter is\r\nhigh and narrow, and articulates with the second and third metacarpal\r\nbones below. The third carpal articulates with the radial and\r\nintermediate above, the third metacarpal bone below. The fourth is the\r\nlargest bone of the row; it articulates with the intermediate and ulnar\r\nabove, the fourth and fifth metacarpals below, and bears a tuberosity on\r\nits volar aspect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 113.—SKELETON OF FOREARM AND MANUS OF PIG, ANTERO-EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Radius; _b_, ulna; _c_, radial carpal; _d_, intermediate carpal;\r\n    _e_, ulnar carpal; _f_, accessory carpal; _g_, first carpal; _h_,\r\n    second carpal; _i_, third carpal; _k_, fourth carpal; _l-o_, second\r\n    to fifth metacarpal bones; _p-s_, second to fifth digits; _1_,\r\n    olecranon; _2_, beak of ulna (proc. anconeus); _3_, semilunar notch;\r\n    _4_, styloid process of ulna; _5_, styloid process of radius; _6_,\r\n    distal epiphyseal lines; _7_, first phalanx; _8_, second phalanx;\r\n    _9_, third phalanx. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nFour =metacarpal bones= are present. The first is absent, the third and\r\nfourth are large and carry the chief digits, while the second and fifth\r\nare much smaller and bear the accessory digits. Their proximal ends\r\narticulate with each other and with the carpus as indicated above. The\r\nbones are consolidated at about two years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The third and fourth metacarpals are flattened from before backward,\r\n  three-sided, and placed close together. The distal end of each bears a\r\n  trochlea for articulation with the first phalanx and the sesamoids.\r\n  The third is the wider of the two, and articulates with all of the\r\n  lower row of the carpus except the first. The fourth articulates with\r\n  the fourth carpal chiefly, but has a small facet for the third. The\r\n  second and fifth metacarpals are placed further back than the chief\r\n  bones. The fifth is considerably the thicker of the two. The proximal\r\n  ends are small and articulate with the corresponding carpal and\r\n  metacarpal bones. The distal end is relatively large; its articular\r\n  surface is condyloid in front, trochlear behind.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach chief digit comprises three =phalanges= and three =sesamoids=. The\r\nbones of the chief digits resemble those of the ox in form, but there is\r\nno foramen on the interdigital side of the extensor process and the\r\nproximal sesamoids are narrow and ridged behind. The phalanges of the\r\naccessory digits (which do not reach the ground ordinarily) are similar\r\nin form but much smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BONES OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =os coxæ= is long and narrow. The ilium and ischium are almost in\r\nline with each other and sagittal in direction. The wing of the =ilium=\r\nbends outward much less than in the horse or ox. The gluteal surface is\r\ndivided into two fossæ by a ridge, which is continuous with the superior\r\nischiatic spine behind. The inner surface presents an extensive rough\r\narea behind, which is in apposition with the wing of the sacrum. The\r\nsmooth iliac area is narrow, and is bounded above by a ridge. The crest\r\nor anterior border is convex, and is thick, rough, and prominent in its\r\nmiddle, which forms the highest point of the bone. The internal angle is\r\nlower than the crest, is directed backward, and articulates internally\r\nwith the sacrum. The external angle is lower still and is very little\r\nthickened. The =ischia= in the female are somewhat divergent and\r\nflattened behind. The tubera are everted and bear three prominences.\r\nThere is a crest or tuberosity on the ventral surface. The superior\r\nischiatic spine is like that of the cow, but is slightly incurved and\r\nthe muscular ridges on its outer face are more pronounced. The\r\nsymphyseal part of the =pubis= is thick and the two bones are almost in\r\na horizontal plane. The ilio-pectineal eminence is prominent and the\r\npsoas tubercle is well marked.\r\n\r\nThe =acetabulum= is placed a little further back than in the ox. The rim\r\nis thick and is cut into posteriorly by a narrow fissure, which leads\r\ninto the deep fossa acetabuli. The three pieces of the os coxæ are fused\r\nby the end of the first year, but the crest and the ischial tubera are\r\npartially separate till the sixth or seventh year. The symphysis does\r\nnot usually undergo complete anchylosis. Interischial bones are present.\r\n\r\nThe =inlet= of the =pelvis= is elliptical and very oblique. In a sow of\r\nfull size the conjugate diameter is about five to six inches (10 to 12\r\ncm.) and the transverse about three and a half to four inches (ca. 8.75\r\nto 10 cm.). In the female the floor is relatively wide and flattened,\r\nespecially at the outlet, where the tubera are everted; it also has a\r\ndecided downward inclination behind. The pelvic axis is therefore\r\ncorrespondingly oblique. The ischial arch is wide. In the boar the pubis\r\nis much thicker and the ischia are not everted posteriorly. The inlet is\r\nsmaller. The floor is concave from side to side and slopes decidedly\r\nless than in the sow. The superior ischiatic spines are more incurved,\r\nand the ischial arch is much narrower and deeper.\r\n\r\nThe =femur= has a relatively wide and massive shaft, on which four\r\nsurfaces might be recognized. The principal nutrient foramen is situated\r\nin the proximal third of the anterior surface. The posterior surface is\r\nwide, and is limited outwardly by a ridge which extends from the\r\ntrochanter major to the large external supracondyloid crest. There is no\r\nsupracondyloid (plantar) fossa. The head is strongly curved, and is\r\nmarked toward the inner side by a rather large depression for the\r\nattachment of the round ligament. The neck is distinct. The trochanter\r\nmajor, although massive, does not extend up as high as the head. The\r\ntrochanteric ridge and fossa resemble those of the ox. The external\r\n(third) trochanter is absent. The ridges of the trochlea are similar and\r\nalmost sagittal.\r\n\r\nThe shaft of the =tibia= is slightly curved, convex internally. The\r\ntuberosity is grooved in front, and a narrow sulcus separates it from\r\nthe external condyle. The facet for the fibula is on the posterior\r\nborder of the latter, and is bounded internally by an eminence. The\r\nupper part of the crest is very prominent and curves outward. The distal\r\nend resembles in general that of the ox, but is relatively narrower\r\ntransversely and thicker from before backward.\r\n\r\nThe =fibula= extends the entire length of the region, and is separated\r\nfrom the tibia by a wide interosseous space. The shaft is flattened from\r\nside to side; the proximal part is wide and deeply grooved externally;\r\nthe lower part is narrower and thicker. The proximal end is flattened,\r\ngrooved externally, and articulates internally with the external condyle\r\nof the tibia. The distal end forms the external malleolus. It is grooved\r\nexternally, and articulates with the tibia and tibial tarsal internally,\r\nwith the fibular tarsal bone distally.\r\n\r\nThe =patella= is very much compressed laterally and presents three\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 114.—COXAL BONES OF PIG, LEFT POSTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Wing, _b_, shaft, _c_, external angle, _d_, anterior border, _e_,\r\n    internal angle, _f_, gluteal line of ilium; _g_, great sciatic\r\n    notch; _h_, smooth, _i_, rough part of ventral surface of ilium;\r\n    _k_, psoas tubercle; _l_, ilio-pectineal eminence; _m_, acetabular\r\n    branch, _n_, symphyseal branch of pubis; _o_, obturator foramen;\r\n    _p_, _p′_, ischium; _q_, _q′_, tuber ischii; _r_, symphysis; _s_,\r\n    ischial arch; _t_, _t′_, superior ischiatic spine; _u_, acetabulum;\r\n    _v_, epiphyseal line. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =tarsus= comprises seven bones. The tibial and the fibular tarsal\r\nresemble in general those of the ox. The axis of the tibial is, however,\r\nslightly oblique downward and inward, and its distal end bears a double\r\ntrochlea for articulation with the central and fourth tarsals. The tuber\r\ncalcis is deeply grooved posteriorly. The central tarsal is narrow\r\ntransversely and thick. Its proximal surface is deeply concave, and the\r\nposterior bears a large tubercle. The first tarsal is high and narrow;\r\nit articulates with the central and second tarsals and the second\r\nmetatarsal bone. The second tarsal is small and somewhat prismatic; it\r\narticulates with the central above, the third in front, the first\r\nbehind, and the second and third metatarsals below. The third tarsal is\r\nmuch larger, and is compressed from above downward, wide in front,\r\nnarrow behind. It articulates with the central tarsal above, the third\r\nmetatarsal below, the second tarsal internally, and the fourth tarsal\r\nexternally. The fourth tarsal is large. Its external face is crossed by\r\nan oblique groove for the tendon of the peroneus longus. The internal\r\nsurface articulates with the central and third tarsals. The proximal\r\nsurface supports the tibial and fibular tarsal bones, and the distal\r\nsurface rests on the fourth and fifth metatarsals. It ossifies from two\r\ncenters.\r\n\r\nThe four =metatarsal bones= resemble the corresponding bones of the fore\r\nlimb, but are somewhat longer. The proximal ends of the third and fourth\r\neach have a considerable projection behind; the process on the third has\r\na facet for articulation with a discoid sesamoid bone. The second and\r\nfifth are placed more on the posterior aspect of the large bones than is\r\nthe case in the fore limb.\r\n\r\nThe first and second =phalanges= are a little longer and narrower than\r\nthose of the fore limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SKELETON OF THE DOG\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VERTEBRAL COLUMN\r\n\r\nThe vertebral formula is C_{7}T_{13}L_{7(6)}S_{3}Cy_{20–23}.\r\n\r\nThe =cervical vertebræ= are relatively longer than in the ox and the\r\npig. The bodies of the typical vertebræ diminish in length from first to\r\nlast and are compressed dorso-ventrally. The anterior extremity is\r\nmoderately convex and the posterior slightly concave; both are oblique.\r\nThe median ridge and lateral grooves on the upper surface of the body\r\nare very well marked. The second, third, and fourth have distinct\r\nventral spines. The spinous process of the third has the form of a long\r\nlow crest; in the remainder it is higher, blunt-pointed, and inclined\r\nforward. The transverse processes of the third, fourth, and fifth\r\nproject downward and backward, and divide into two branches; of these,\r\nthe anterior one is thin, and the posterior is thick and tuberculate at\r\nits free end. The process of the sixth has two parts; one of these is an\r\nextensive quadrilateral plate directed downward and outward and ridged\r\non its inner surface; the other part is short and blunt, and is directed\r\noutward and a little backward and upward. The seventh is readily\r\ndistinguished by its shortness, the length of its spine, and the single\r\ntransverse process. The posterior articular processes bear tubercles\r\nwhich are large on the third, fourth, and fifth.\r\n\r\nThe ventral arch of the =atlas= is narrow from before backward, and\r\nbears a small tubercle posteriorly. The upper surface of the dorsal arch\r\nis strongly convex and rough centrally. The wings are wide, flattened,\r\nand almost horizontal. The upper surface is rough. There is an alar\r\nnotch (Incisura alaris) on the anterior border instead of the anterior\r\nforamen. The foramen transversarium is present.\r\n\r\nThe body of the =axis= is flattened dorso-ventrally, especially in\r\nfront. The odontoid process is rounded and relatively long, reaching\r\nalmost to the occipital bone; it is inclined upward a little. The\r\narticular surfaces which flank it are condyloid in form and very\r\noblique. The inferior surface is wide, and is divided by a median crest\r\ninto two fossæ. The transverse processes are single, pointed, directed\r\nbackward and outward, and perforated by relatively large foramina\r\ntransversaria. The spinous process is thin and of moderate height, but\r\nvery long; it is prolonged forward so as to overhang the dorsal arch of\r\nthe atlas, and is terminated behind by a tuberosity which is connected\r\nby two crests with the posterior articular processes. The anterior\r\nnotches are large and are never converted into foramina.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the =thoracic vertebræ= are wide and compressed\r\ndorso-ventrally, especially at each end of the region. Their convex\r\nanterior surfaces are depressed in the middle. The posterior facets for\r\nthe heads of the ribs are absent on the last three or four. The\r\ntransverse processes resemble those of the horse. They bear mammillary\r\nprocesses except at the anterior end of the region. The facets for the\r\ntubercles of the ribs are large and concave in the anterior part of the\r\nseries, and become smaller and slightly convex further back. The last\r\nthree have accessory processes also. The first three or four spinous\r\nprocesses are about equal in length. Behind this they become gradually\r\nshorter to the tenth, and then remain equal. The backward slope is most\r\nmarked in the ninth and tenth. The eleventh is practically vertical\r\n(anticlinal vertebra) and the last two incline slightly forward.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of the =lumbar vertebræ= are decidedly flattened\r\ndorso-ventrally, and increase in width from first to last. The length\r\nincreases to the sixth. The transverse processes are plate-like and are\r\ndirected forward and downward. Their length increases to the fifth and\r\nsixth. They form no joints with each other or with the sacrum. Their\r\nextremities are enlarged, with the exception of the last. The accessory\r\nprocesses project backward over the posterior notches of the first five.\r\nThe anterior articular processes are large, compressed laterally, and\r\nbear mammillary processes. The spinous processes are broad below,\r\nnarrower above, and with the exception of the last, incline a little\r\nforward. Their height diminishes behind the fourth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 115.—SKELETON OF DOG, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Cranium; _b_, face; _c_, mandible; _1H-7H_, cervical vertebræ;\r\n    _13B_, last thoracic vertebra; _1L-7L_, lumbar vertebræ; _K_,\r\n    sacrum; _S_, coccygeal vertebræ; _1R-13R_, ribs; _R.Kn._, costal\r\n    cartilages; _St._, sternum; _d_, scapula; _d′_, supraspinous fossa;\r\n    _d″_, infraspinous fossa; _1_, spine of scapula; _2_, acromion; _3_,\r\n    tuberosity of scapula; _3′_, articular end of scapula; _e_, humerus;\r\n    _4_, head of humerus; _5_, external tuberosity of humerus; _5′_,\r\n    deltoid ridge; _6_, _6′_, epicondyles of humerus; _7_, external\r\n    condyloid crest; _7′_, coronoid fossa; _f_, radius; _g_, ulna; _8_,\r\n    olecranon; _9_, “beak” of ulna; _h_, carpus; _i_, metacarpus; _k_,\r\n    proximal phalanges; _l_, middle phalanges; _m_, distal phalanges;\r\n    _n_, sesamoid; _p_, ilium; _10_, wing of ilium; _11_, shaft of\r\n    ilium; _12_, crest of ilium; _13_, external angle of ilium (tuber\r\n    coxæ); _14_, internal angle of ilium (tuber sacrale); _15_, superior\r\n    ischiatic spine; _q_, pubis; _r_, ischium; _16_, tuber ischii; _17_,\r\n    acetabulum; _s_, femur; _18_, head of femur; _19_, trochanter major;\r\n    _20_, trochanter minor; _21_, trochanter tertius; _22_, _23_,\r\n    condyles; _24_, _25_, epicondyles; _26_, trochlea; _t_, patella;\r\n    _u_, tibia; _27_, tuberosity of tibia; _28_, _29_, condyles of\r\n    tibia; _30_, internal malleolus; _v_, fibula; _31_, external\r\n    malleolus; _32_, head of fibula; _w_, tarsus; _x_, metatarsus; _y_,\r\n    phalanges; _33_, occipital bone; _34_, paramastoid (styloid)\r\n    process; _35_, parietal bone; _36_, frontal bone; _37_, lacrimal\r\n    bone; _38_, malar bone; _39_, squamous temporal; _40_, maxilla;\r\n    _40′_, infraorbital foramen; _41_, premaxilla; _42_, nasal bone;\r\n    _43_, external auditory meatus; _44_, canine tooth; _45_, masseteric\r\n    fossa; _46_, angular process of mandible. (After Ellenberger, in\r\n    Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =sacrum= results from the early fusion of three vertebræ. It is\r\nshort, wide, and quadrangular. The spines are fused to form a median\r\ncrest, which is notched, however, between the summits of the spines. On\r\neither side are two tubercles, vestiges of the fused articular\r\nprocesses. The pelvic surface is deeply concave and presents two pairs\r\nof foramina. The wings are prismatic and very high. Their lateral\r\nsurfaces are extensive, face almost directly outward, and bear an\r\nauricular surface on the lower part. The anterior surface of the body of\r\nthe first vertebra is extensive, depressed in its middle, and bears a\r\nprominent lip below. The anterior articular processes are large and have\r\nextensive, slightly concave facets which face upward and inward. The\r\nposterior articular processes are small. The transverse processes of the\r\nlast vertebra project backward and may articulate or fuse with those of\r\nthe first coccygeal. The sacral canal is strongly compressed\r\ndorso-ventrally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 116.—ATLAS OF DOG, VIEWED FROM ABOVE AND BEHIND.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Wing; _b_, dorsal arch and tubercle; _c_, ventral tubercle; _d_,\r\n    intervertebral foramen; _e_, foramen transversarium; _f_, articular\r\n    surface for axis.

The first three\r\nor four have well developed articular processes at each end. Behind this\r\nthe posterior pair quickly disappears, and the anterior ones become\r\nnon-articular and gradually reduced in size. The transverse processes of\r\nthe first five or six are relatively large; behind this they quickly\r\ndisappear. =Hæmal arches= (or chevron bones) in the form of a =V= or =Y=\r\noccur ventrally at the intercentral junctions of the third, fourth, and\r\nfifth usually. They transmit the middle coccygeal artery, which passes\r\nbetween pairs of ventral tubercles further back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 118.—SIXTH CERVICAL VERTEBRA OF DOG, LEFT VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Ventral plate, _b_, lateral part of transverse process; _c_,\r\n    foramen transversarium; _d_, anterior articular process; _f_,\r\n    accessory process; _g_, spinous process; _h_, articular head of\r\n    body.

The posterior thoracic and\r\nthe lumbar vertebra form a second curve, concave ventrally. The sacral\r\npromontory is well marked. The sacrum and the anterior part of the\r\ncoccygeal region constitute a third and more pronounced curve, concave\r\nventrally. In long-tailed dogs the sacro-coccygeal region is somewhat\r\n=S=-shaped.\r\n\r\n=Variations.=—Numerical variations are not common except in the\r\ncoccygeal region. The number of thoracic vertebræ may be twelve or\r\nfourteen, with or without compensatory change in the lumbar region.\r\nGirard recorded a case with eight lumbar and the usual number of\r\nthoracic vertebra. Six lumbar with fourteen thoracic vertebræ have been\r\nmet with. The first coccygeal sometimes unites with the sacrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE RIBS\r\n\r\nThirteen pairs of ribs are present, of which nine are sternal and four\r\nasternal. They are strongly curved, narrow, and thick. Those in the\r\nmiddle of the series are the longest. The first eight or nine increase\r\nin width in their lower part. The last rib is usually floating. The\r\ncostal cartilages are long and curve forward; the length and curvature\r\nof the first pair is a striking special feature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 120.—FOURTH LUMBAR VERTEBRA OF DOG, LEFT VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, _b_, Articular surfaces of body; _c_, transverse process; _d_,\r\n    accessory process; _e_, anterior articular process; _e′_, mammillary\r\n    process; _f_, posterior articular process; _g_, spinous process.\r\n    (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d.

The first\r\nsegment is the longest; its anterior end is blunt-pointed and bears a\r\nshort conical cartilage. It widens at the point of articulation of the\r\nfirst pair of cartilages. The last segment is also long, thinner than\r\nits predecessors, wide in front, and narrow behind, where it bears a\r\nnarrow xiphoid cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =thorax= is distinctly barrel-like and is not decidedly compressed\r\nanteriorly like that of the horse and ox. The inlet is oval and is\r\nrelatively wide on account of the marked curvature of the first pair of\r\nribs and cartilages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           BONES OF THE SKULL\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the following descriptions of the separate bones an intermediate\r\n  type—_e. g._, a fox terrier—is selected, and the most striking\r\n  differences in the brachycephalic and dolichocephalic breeds will be\r\n  considered in the section on the skull as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CRANIUM\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 122.—BASE OF SKULL OF DOG, WITHOUT MANDIBLE.\r\n\r\n  _I_, Occipital; _II_, tympanic part of temporal; _IIa_, squamous part\r\n    of temporal; _IIb_, mastoid part of temporal; _III_, sphenoid; _IV_,\r\n    pterygoid; _V_, palate bone; _VI_, vomer; _VII_, malar; _VIII_,\r\n    zygomatic arch; _IX_, inner wall of orbit; _X_, palatine process of\r\n    maxilla; _XI_, premaxilla; _XII_, orbital cavity; _1_, _1_,\r\n    tubercles above foramen magnum; _2_, foramen magnum; _3_, occipital\r\n    condyle; _4_, notch between occipital condyles; _5_, condyloid\r\n    fossa; _6_, hypoglossal foramen; _7_, paramastoid (styloid, jugular)\r\n    process; _8_, for. lacerum and posterior opening of carotid canal;\r\n    _9_, petro-occipital synchondrosis; _10_, petro-tympanic fissure;\r\n    _11_, tubercle; _12_, bulla ossea; _13_, muscular process of\r\n    petrous; _14_, carotid foramen; _15_, osseous Eustachian tube; _16_,\r\n    postglenoid process; _17_, glenoid cavity; _18_, for. ovale; _19_,\r\n    posterior opening of alar canal; _20_, external opening of\r\n    parieto-temporal canal; _21_, stylo-mastoid foramen; _22_, external\r\n    auditory meatus; _23_, temporal crest; _24_, zygomatic process of\r\n    temporal bone; _25_, body of postsphenoid; _26_, body of\r\n    presphenoid; _27_, anterior opening of alar canal; _28_, for.\r\n    lacerum orbitale; _29_, optic foramen; _30_, hamulus of pterygoid;\r\n    _31_, horizontal part of palate bone; _32_, perpendicular part of\r\n    palate bone; _33_, median palatine suture; _34_, palato-maxillary\r\n    suture; _35_, posterior nasal spine; _36_, anterior palatine\r\n    foramen; _37_, palatine groove; _38_, alveolar border of maxilla;\r\n    _39_, palatine process of maxilla; _40_, pterygoid process of\r\n    maxilla; _41_, palatine fissure; _42_, body of premaxilla; _43_,\r\n    palatine process of premaxilla; _44_, alveolar border of premaxilla;\r\n    _45_, supraorbital process of frontal bone. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat.\r\n    d. Hundes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =occipital bone= is similar in position to that of the horse. The\r\ncrest, is prominent, angular, and directed backward. Just below the\r\ncrest are two rough imprints or tubercles for muscular attachment. The\r\nsurface below these is convex from side to side and concave from above\r\ndownward. On either side, at the junction with the squamous, there is a\r\nforamen which communicates with the parieto-temporal canal. The condyles\r\nare somewhat flattened and are widely separated above; at the inner side\r\nof each is a short condyloid canal, which opens into the\r\nparieto-temporal canal. The paramastoid processes are very short. The\r\nbasilar part is wide and joins the bulla ossea on either side; its lower\r\nsurface is flattened and the tubercles are at the junction with the\r\nbulla. The hypoglossal foramen is small and is close to the foramen\r\nlacerum posterius; the latter is bounded in front by the bulla ossea,\r\nbehind and internally by the occipital bone.\r\n\r\nThe =interparietal bone= fuses with the occipital before birth. It forms\r\nthe high posterior part of the sagittal crest, and is wedged in between\r\nthe two parietal bones. The tentorium osseum is thin and curved, concave\r\nventrally. Its base concurs with the occipital and parietal bones in the\r\nformation of a transverse canal which is continuous with the\r\nparieto-temporal canals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 123.—SKULL OF DOG, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _I_, Occipital; _II_, parietal; _III_, frontal; _IV_, lacrimal; _V_,\r\n    malar; _VI_, squamous temporal; _VII_, nasal; _VIII_, maxilla; _IX_,\r\n    premaxilla; _1_, supraoccipital; _2_, interparietal; _3_,\r\n    parieto-occipital suture; _4_, occipital crest; _5_, sagittal crest;\r\n    _6_, parieto-frontal suture; _7_, squamous suture; _8_, parietal\r\n    eminence; _9_, antero-external angle of parietal bone; _10_, frontal\r\n    crest; _11_, _14_, orbital margin; _12_, supraorbital process; _13_,\r\n    frontal fossa; _15_, temporal part of frontal bone; _16_, nasal\r\n    process of frontal bone; _17_, frontal suture; _18_, lacrimal\r\n    foramen; _19_, maxillary process of frontal bone; _20_,\r\n    lacrimo-maxillary suture; _21_, frontal process of malar bone; _22_,\r\n    lacrimal process of malar; _23_, zygomatic process of malar; _24_,\r\n    zygomatic process of squamous temporal; _24′_, posterior end of\r\n    nasal bone; _25_, nasal suture; _26_, anterior end of nasal bone;\r\n    _27_, infraorbital foramen; _28_, canine tooth; _29_, cheek tooth;\r\n    _30_, frontal process of maxilla; _31_, body, _32_, nasal process,\r\n    _33_, palatine process of premaxilla; _34_, palatine fissure; _35_,\r\n    incisor teeth. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Hundes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =parietal bone= is rhomboid in outline and is strongly curved. It is\r\nextensive and forms the greater part of the roof of the cranial cavity.\r\nAt the junction of the right and left bones there is a prominent\r\nsagittal crest which is continued upon the frontal bones. The lower\r\nborder articulates with the temporal wing of the sphenoid by its\r\nanterior part and with the squamous temporal in the remainder of its\r\nextent. The external surface enters into the formation of the temporal\r\nfossa. The internal surface is marked by digital impressions, and by\r\ngrooves for the middle meningeal artery and its branches.\r\n\r\nThe external surface of the =frontal bone= is crossed by a frontal\r\ncrest, which extends in a curve from the sagittal crest to the\r\nsupraorbital process, and separates the frontal and temporal parts. The\r\nfrontal parts of the two bones form a central depression and slope\r\ndownward and forward. The supraorbital process is very short, so that\r\nthe orbital margin is incomplete as in the pig. The supraorbital foramen\r\nis absent. In front there is a narrow pointed nasal part which fits in\r\nbetween the nasal bone and the maxilla. The orbital and temporal parts\r\nare relatively extensive. Two ethmoidal foramina are commonly present.\r\nThe frontal sinus is confined to the frontal bone.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the =temporal bone= fuse early. The zygomatic process\r\ncurves widely outward and forward. Its anterior part is beveled below\r\nand articulates extensively with the corresponding process of the malar.\r\nThe articular surface for the condyle of the mandible consists of a\r\ntransverse groove which is continued upon the front of the large\r\npostglenoid process. Behind the latter is the lower opening of the\r\nparieto-temporal canal. There is no condyle. The mastoid part is small,\r\nbut bears a distinct mastoid process. The external auditory meatus is\r\nlarge and the canal very short, so that one can see into the tympanum in\r\nthe dry skull. The India ossea is very large and is rounded and smooth;\r\nthe inner side is united to the basioccipital. Above this junction and\r\nroofed in by the union of the petrous part and the basioccipital is the\r\n=petro-basilar canal= (Canalis petrobasilaris); this transmits a vein\r\nfrom the floor of the cranium to the foramen lacerum posterius. The\r\nlatter is in reality a depression and is situated behind the bulla\r\nossea. In its posterior part is a foramen which transmits the ninth,\r\ntenth, and eleventh cranial nerves. The =carotid canal= branches off\r\nfrom the petro-basilar, passes forward external to it through the inner\r\npart of the bulla ossea, and opens in front at the =carotid foramen=; it\r\ntransmits the internal carotid artery. The Eustachian opening is\r\nimmediately external to the carotid foramen. The muscular and hyoid\r\nprocesses are extremely rudimentary. The petrous part projects into the\r\ncranial cavity and forms a sharp prominent petrosal crest. The inner\r\nsurface presents a deep =floccular fossa= above the internal auditory\r\nmeatus. The anterior surface is also free. The anterior angle is\r\nperforated by a =canal= for the fifth cranial nerve (Canalis nervi\r\ntrigemini).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 124.—CRANIAL CAVITY OF DOG, AS SEEN ON SAGITTAL SECTION OF SKULL.\r\n\r\n  _I_, Roof of cranium; _II_, base of cranium; _III_, posterior wall of\r\n    cranium; _IV_, anterior wall of cranium; _A_, anterior cranial\r\n    fossa; _B_, middle cranial fossa; _C_, posterior cranial fossa; _a_,\r\n    body of presphenoid; _a′_, body of postsphenoid; _c_, palate bone;\r\n    _d_, vomer; _e_, occipital; _f_, occipital condyle; _g_, sagittal\r\n    crest; _h_, frontal sinus; _h′_, cranial plate of frontal bone; _i_,\r\n    cribriform plate of ethmoid bone; _i′_, ethmoidal foramen; _k_,\r\n    ethmoturbinals; _l_, parietal bone; _l′_, _l″_, squamous temporal\r\n    bone; _l‴_, temporal wing of sphenoid bone; _m_, sella turcica;\r\n    _m′_, dorsum sellæ; _n_, optic foramen; _o_, foramen lacerum\r\n    orbitale; _p_, foramen rotundum; _q_, foramen ovale; _r_, _r′_,\r\n    carotid foramina; _s_, tentorium osseum; _t_, foramen lacerum; _u_,\r\n    _u′_, orifices of parieto-temporal canal; _v_, condyloid canal; _w_,\r\n    canal for trigeminal nerve; _x_, internal auditory meatus; _y_,\r\n    _y′_, orifices of canal for inferior occipital sinus; _z_, floccular\r\n    fossa. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe body of the =sphenoid bone= is flattened dorso-ventrally. The sella\r\nturcica is shallow, but the dorsum sellæ is well developed and bears\r\n=posterior clinoid processes=. A pair of =anterior clinoid processes=\r\nproject back from the roots of the orbital wings. The latter are\r\nrelatively small and are crossed externally by a crest, which is\r\ncontinued forward upon the palate bone. The temporal wings are extensive\r\nand articulate above with the parietals. Perforating the roots of the\r\nwings are the following foramina, named from before backward: The optic\r\npasses through the orbital wing. The foramen lacerum orbitale is a\r\nlittle lower and is at the junction of the wings. The foramen rotundum\r\nopens into the alar canal, which passes through the root of the short\r\nbut wide pterygoid process. The foramen ovale is near the posterior\r\nborder of the temporal wing. There is no sphenoidal sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =ethmoid bone= is highly developed. The cribriform plate is\r\nextensive, and the olfactory fossæ are very deep. The crista galli is\r\nlittle developed, and often incomplete. The perpendicular plate is long.\r\nThe lateral masses are greatly developed and bulge upward into the\r\nfrontal sinus. There are four large endoturbinals and six ectoturbinals.\r\nThe lamina papyracea is extensive and forms the inner wall of the\r\nmaxillary sinus. Its lower border joins the palatine process of the\r\nmaxilla and the horizontal part of the palate bone. A shelf-like plate\r\nextends inward from its lower part and concurs with the similarly\r\nincurved part of the palate bone in forming the =transverse lamina=\r\n(Lamina transversalis), which divides the olfactory fundus of the nasal\r\ncavity from the naso-pharyngeal meatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  FACE\r\n\r\nThe =maxilla= is short, but very high posteriorly. The facial crest is\r\nabsent. The infraorbital foramen is over the alveolus for the third\r\npremolar. The =frontal process= fits into a deep notch between the nasal\r\nand orbital parts of the frontal bone, and the middle part of the\r\nposterior border lies along the orbital margin. There are more or less\r\npronounced ridges, juga alveolaria, over the canine and molar teeth. The\r\nzygomatic process is short and thin; it is completely overlapped\r\noutwardly by the malar, and is perforated by a number of foramina\r\n(Foramina alveolaria). A maxillary tuberosity is not present in the\r\nadult, but there is a pointed projection, the pterygoid process, behind\r\nthe last alveolus. The internal surface bears a short turbinal crest on\r\nits anterior part, behind which it is deeply concave and forms the outer\r\nwall of the maxillary sinus. The palatine process is short, wide behind,\r\nand moderately arched from side to side. The anterior palatine foramen\r\nis situated at or close to the transverse palatine suture about midway\r\nbetween the median suture and the alveolar border. The palatine groove\r\nis distinct. The large alveolus for the canine tooth is completed by the\r\npremaxilla. The small alveolus for the first premolar is separated from\r\nthe preceding one by a small interval. The next two consist of anterior\r\nand posterior parts for the roots of the teeth. The fourth and fifth are\r\nmuch larger and are divided into three parts. The last is small and\r\nconsists of three divisions. The infraorbital canal is short.\r\n\r\nThe body of the =premaxilla= is compressed dorso-ventrally, and contains\r\nthree alveoli for the incisor teeth, which increase in size from first\r\nto third; it also completes the inner wall of the large alveolus for the\r\ncanine tooth. The foramen incisivum is very small except in large\r\nskulls. The interalveolar border is wide and very short. The nasal\r\nprocess is wide at its origin and tapers to a sharp point behind; the\r\nanterior part curves upward, backward, and a little inward, and forms\r\nthe lateral margin of the osseous nasal aperture; the posterior part\r\nextends backward a long distance between the nasal bone and the maxilla.\r\nThe palatine process turns upward and outward, forming with its fellow a\r\nwide groove for the septal cartilage; the posterior end is pointed and\r\nfits into a notch between the palatine processes of the maxillæ, and\r\nsupports the end of the vomer. The palatine fissure is short but wide.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal part of the =palate bones= is extensive, forming about\r\none-third of the hard palate. It presents a variable number of lesser\r\npalatine foramina. There is usually a pointed posterior nasal spine at\r\nthe end of the median suture. The palatine canal is sometimes formed\r\nentirely in this bone. The perpendicular part is even more extensive.\r\nIts external surface is chiefly free and forms most of the inner wall of\r\nthe large pterygo-palatine fossa. The maxillary foramen is situated in a\r\ndeep recess between this bone and the zygomatic process of the maxilla.\r\nJust above it there is commonly another foramen which opens into the\r\nnasal cavity. The posterior palatine and sphenopalatine foramina are\r\nsituated further back and a little lower; the former is immediately\r\nbelow the latter. A horizontal plate extends from the inner surface,\r\nmeets that of the opposite bone and completes the lamina transversalis\r\nspoken of in the description of the ethmoid bone. There is no palatine\r\nsinus.\r\n\r\nThe =pterygoid bones= are very wide and short. They form a considerable\r\npart of the lateral boundaries of the posterior nares. The lower and\r\nposterior holders are free and at their angle of junction there is a\r\nvariable hamulus.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal bones= are (in most breeds) long and wider in front than\r\nbehind. The external surface is variably concave in its length and is\r\ninclined toward the median suture so as to form a central groove. The\r\ninner borders turn downward and form an internal nasal crest which\r\nbecomes very prominent behind. The posterior parts fit into a notch\r\nformed by the frontal bones. The anterior ends form an almost\r\nsemicircular nasal notch.\r\n\r\nThe =lacrimal bone= is very small. The facial part extends very little\r\nor not at all beyond the orbital margin. The orbital surface is small\r\nand triangular, and presents the entrance to the lacrimal canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 125.—MANDIBLE OF DOG, RIGHT-ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Right ramus; _b_, left ramus; _c_, body; _d_, alveolar border;\r\n    _e_, processus angularis; _f_, condyle; _g_, coronoid process; _h_,\r\n    masseteric fossa; _i_, _k_, crests which form the upper and lower\r\n    boundaries of fossa; _l_, mandibular foramen; _m_, mental foramina;\r\n    _n_, masseteric line; _o_, sigmoid notch. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat.\r\n    d. Hundes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe large zygomatic process constitutes the bulk of the =malar bone=. It\r\nis very long and is strongly curved. The upper border is convex, free in\r\nfront, where it forms part of the orbital margin, beveled behind for\r\narticulation with the similar process of the temporal bone. Between\r\nthese it bears an eminence, the processus frontalis, to which the\r\norbital ligament is attached. The body of the bone may be considered to\r\nconsist of a =lacrimal process= directed upward and fitting in between\r\nthe lacrimal and maxilla, and a =maxillary process= directed downward.\r\nThe facial surface is convex.\r\n\r\nThe =superior turbinal bone= is in its anterior part a simple plate,\r\nattached by one edge to the nasal bone; it curves downward and inward,\r\nand its free border is thickened and everted. The posterior part is\r\nwider and resembles the ethmoturbinals, with which it is connected.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior turbinal bone= is short and very complex. It is attached\r\nto the nasal surface of the maxilla by a basal lamina, which divides\r\ninto two secondary lamellæ. The latter detach numerous tertiary lamellæ,\r\nwhich are coiled and have thick free edges (Fig. 373).\r\n\r\nThe =vomer= is not in contact with the posterior part of the floor of\r\nthe nasal cavity, and does not divide the posterior nares. The posterior\r\nend is narrow and deeply notched. Near the posterior nares the two\r\nplates curve outward and join the palate bones and assist in forming the\r\nlamina transversalis.\r\n\r\nThe two halves of the =mandible= do not fuse completely even in old age.\r\nThe body presents six alveoli for the incisor teeth and two for the\r\ncanines. The incisor alveoli increase in size from first to third. The\r\ncanine alveoli extend deeply downward and backward. There are usually\r\ntwo or more foramina on the mental surface. The rami diverge less than\r\nin the pig. The inferior border of the horizontal part is convex in its\r\nlength and is thick and rounded. The alveolar border slightly concave in\r\nits length and is a little everted, especially in its middle; it\r\npresents seven alveoli for the lower cheek teeth, which resemble those\r\nof the upper jaw except that the fourth and sixth are much smaller and\r\nthe fifth is like the fourth of the upper series. The interalveolar\r\nspace is very short or even absent. There are two or three mental\r\nforamina on either side. The vertical part is relatively small. Its\r\nexternal surface presents a deep =masseteric fossa= which encroaches on\r\nthe coronoid process and is limited by ridges in front and below. The\r\ninternal surface is convex and is marked by the usual foramen. At about\r\nthe same level as the latter is the rough =angular process= (Processus\r\nangularis), which projects backward from the posterior border, and is\r\nequivalent to the angle of the other animals. The condyle is placed very\r\nlow—not much higher than the apex of the canine tooth when the bone is\r\nresting on a flat surface. It is long transversely and the inner part of\r\nthe articular surface is much the wider and extends over the posterior\r\nsurface. Its long axis is a little oblique, the inner end being inclined\r\nsomewhat downward and forward. The coronoid process is very extensive\r\nand is bent slightly outward and backward.\r\n\r\nThe body of the =hyoid bone= is a slightly curved transverse rod; it is\r\ncompressed from before backward, and bears no lingual process. The\r\nthyroid cornua are permanently attached to the body by cartilage; they\r\ndiverge widely, curve inward, and are compressed laterally. The small\r\ncornua are short, prismatic, and strong. The middle cornua are commonly\r\na little longer than the great cornua; they are compressed laterally,\r\nand are slightly enlarged at the ends, which are joined by cartilage to\r\nthe adjacent cornua. The great cornua are bent outward and are somewhat\r\ntwisted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SKULL AS A WHOLE\r\n\r\nThe different breeds of dog display great variations in the form and\r\nsize of the skull. Those which have a long narrow skull (_e. g._,\r\ngreyhound, collie) are designated =dolichocephalic=. Other dogs (_e.\r\ng._, bulldog, small spaniels, pugs) have very broad, short skulls and\r\nare termed =brachycephalic=. Intermediate forms (e. g., fox terrier,\r\ndachshund) are =mesaticephalic=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The length is usually measured from the occipital crest to the\r\n  anterior end of the premaxillary suture, and the breadth between the\r\n  summits of the zygomatic arches. The cephalic index is the relation of\r\n  the breadth to the length, assuming the latter equal 100; the formula\r\n  is: (breadth × 100)/(length) = cephalic index. The index of extreme\r\n  dolichocephalic breeds is about 50 or even less, as in the greyhound,\r\n  and that of brachycephalic specimens may be as high as 90, as in the\r\n  bulldog and pugs. Among the mesaticephalic types are the fox terrier,\r\n  with an index of about 70, and the white Pomeranian, with one about 72\r\n  to 75. The cranio-facial index is the relation of the distance from\r\n  the occipital crest to the fronto-nasal suture to that between the\r\n  latter and the nasal notch. It varies from 10 ∶ 3 in extreme\r\n  brachycephalic breeds to 10 ∶ 7 in extreme dolichocephalic subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =superior surface= shows the wide outward curve of the zygomatic\r\narches, and the great extent of the temporal fossæ. The latter are\r\nseparated by the sagittal crest, which in the larger breeds is very\r\nstrong and prominent, and is continued by the diverging frontal ridges\r\nto the supraorbital processes. The frontal and nasal regions are\r\ncentrally depressed, and are more or less concave in profile. The nasal\r\nregion is narrow and is terminated in front by a nasal notch. In the\r\nextreme brachycephalic breeds the differences are very striking. The\r\ncranium is strongly convex in both directions and is considerably longer\r\nthan the face. The sagittal crest is more or less effaced and is formed\r\nby the interparietal only. The parieto-frontal crests are separated by\r\nan interval behind and diverge to the supraorbital processes, so that\r\nthe temporal fossæ are widely separated. The frontal region is wide,\r\nstrongly convex, and has a shallow central depression. The nasal region\r\nis very short, relatively wide, and centrally depressed. In profile\r\nthere is a marked depression at the fronto-nasal junction, producing\r\nwhat is termed by fanciers the “stop” of the face.\r\n\r\nOn the =lateral surface= the great extent of the temporal fossa is seen.\r\nThe orbit communicates freely with the fossa, the posterior part of the\r\norbital margin being absent in the dry skull. The axis of the orbital\r\ncavity forms a much smaller angle with the median plane than in the\r\nhorse and ox. A distinct crest marks the limit between the orbital\r\ncavity proper and the extensive pterygo-palatine fossa. The preorbital\r\nregion is somewhat triangular, concave in its length, and convex from\r\nabove downward. The infraorbital foramen is on its lower part above the\r\nthird cheek tooth. In extreme brachycephalic breeds the orbit is\r\nrelatively very large and the preorbital region extremely short but\r\nhigh. In the bulldog the lower jaw protrudes beyond the upper—a\r\ncondition known as prognathism. The opposite condition, brachygnathism,\r\nis seen in the dachshund.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 126.—SKULL OF BRACHYCEPHALIC DOG, DORSAL VIEW WITHOUT MANDIBLE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nStriking features on the =basal surface= of the cranium are the width\r\nand flatness of the basioccipital, the small size of the paramastoid\r\nprocesses, the large size and rounded shape of the bulla ossea, and the\r\ngrooved form of the articular surfaces for the mandible. The posterior\r\nnares are long and narrow and are not divided by the vomer. The hard\r\npalate is usually about half the length of the skull. It is commonly\r\nmarked by a median crest or rough line, and on each side are the\r\nanterior and accessory palatine foramina and the palatine grooves. The\r\nwidth is greatest between the fourth pair of cheek teeth, and here there\r\nis in most skulls a pronounced depression on either side. The length,\r\nwidth, and contour vary greatly in different breeds.\r\n\r\nThe angle of divergence of the rami of the mandible varies from 25 to 30\r\ndegrees; it is smallest in the greyhound, largest in extreme\r\nbrachycephalic types, _e. g._, bulldog, pug.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =nuchal surface= is somewhat triangular, with the\r\nbase below. The summit is formed by the occipital crest, which projects\r\nvery strongly backward in the large breeds. Below it there are two very\r\ndistinct rough imprints for muscular attachment. In some skulls there is\r\na thin median crest, in others a rounded elevation. Laterally are the\r\ntemporal crests and the mastoid processes. There is usually a foramen in\r\nthe temporo-occipital suture above the root of the paramastoid process.\r\nThe foramen magnum varies greatly in form; most often the transverse\r\ndiameter is the greater, but in some skulls it is equaled or exceeded by\r\nthe vertical diameter.\r\n\r\nThe =cranial cavity= (Fig. 124) corresponds in form and size with the\r\ncranium, specially in those breeds in which the various crests are more\r\nor less effaced and the frontal sinuses are small. The basi-cranial axis\r\nis almost parallel with the palate, and the floor is flattened. The\r\nanterior fossa is narrow and is only slightly higher than the middle\r\none. The olfactory fossæ are very deep and the crista galli is little\r\ndeveloped. The sella turcica is variable in depth, and the dorsum sellæ\r\nis relatively high and bears clinoid processes laterally. The cerebral\r\nand cerebellar compartments are well marked off laterally by the\r\npetrosal crests and above by the tentorium osseum. The base of the\r\nlatter is traversed by a canal which connects the two parieto-temporal\r\ncanals. The anterior angle of the petrous temporal is perforated by a\r\ncanal for the fifth cranial nerve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 127.—SKULL OF BRACHYCEPHALIC DOG, LATERAL VIEW WITHOUT MANDIBLE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =nasal cavity= (Fig. 373) conforms to the shape of the face. Its\r\nanterior aperture is large and nearly circular in most dogs. The complex\r\ninferior turbinals occupy the anterior part of the cavity to a large\r\nextent, except near the aperture. Behind the inferior turbinals is the\r\nlarge opening of the maxillary sinus. Behind this the cavity is divided\r\nby a horizontal plate (Lamina transversalis) into a large upper\r\nolfactory region or fundus nasi and a lower naso-pharyngeal canal. The\r\nfundus is occupied largely by the ethmoturbinals. The posterior nares\r\nare undivided and are in general long and narrow, but vary with the\r\nshape of the skull.\r\n\r\nThe =frontal sinus= is of considerable size in the large breeds, but is\r\nconfined to the frontal bone. It is usually divided into a small\r\nanterior and a much larger posterior compartment, each of which opens\r\ninto the superior ethmoidal meatus. The sinus is very small in extreme\r\nbrachycephalic types.\r\n\r\nThe =maxillary sinus= is small, and is in such free communication with\r\nthe nasal cavity as to make it rather a recess than a true sinus. It is\r\nbounded internally by the lamina papyracea of the ethmoid, and its outer\r\nwall is crossed obliquely by the lacrimal canal. The roots of the molar\r\nteeth do not project up into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BONES OF THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =clavicle= is a small, thin, irregularly-triangular bony or\r\ncartilaginous plate. It is embedded in the mastoido-humeralis muscle in\r\nfront of the shoulder joint and forms no articulation with the rest of\r\nthe skeleton. (It is nearly an inch long in a large cat and is a slender\r\ncurved rod.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 128.—RIGHT SCAPULA OF DOG, EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_.

Hundes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =scapula= is relatively long and narrow. The spine increases\r\ngradually in height from above downward and divides the external surface\r\ninto two nearly equal fossæ. Its free edge is thick and rough above, and\r\nat the lower part is thin and bent backward. The =acromion= is short and\r\nblunt and is opposite the rim of the glenoid cavity. The subscapular\r\nfossa is very shallow and is marked by rough lines. The rough area above\r\nit for the attachment of the serratus magnus is large and quadrilateral\r\nin front, narrow and marginal behind. The anterior border is thin,\r\nstrongly convex, and sinuous. The posterior border is straight and\r\nthick. The vertebral border is convex and thick and bears a band of\r\ncartilage. The cervical angle is rounded. The dorsal angle is thick and\r\nsquare. The neck is well defined and bears a rough eminence posteriorly.\r\nThe glenoid cavity is continued forward upon the lower face of the\r\nscapular tuberosity, which is blunt and bears no distinct coracoid\r\nprocess. There is a rough eminence on the posterior surface of the neck,\r\nfrom which the long head of the triceps arises. The cervical angle is\r\nopposite the first thoracic spine, the dorsal angle lies above the\r\nvertebral end of the fourth rib, and the articular angle at a point just\r\nin front of the sternal end of the first rib in the ordinary standing\r\nposition. The shoulder has a great range of movement on the chest-wall.\r\n\r\nThe =humerus= is relatively very long, rather slender, and has a slight\r\nspiral twist. The shaft is somewhat compressed laterally, especially in\r\nits upper two-thirds; this part is curved in varying degree, convex in\r\nfront. The deltoid tuberosity has the form of a low ridge, and it is\r\ncontinued by a crest which runs upward and backward and bears a tubercle\r\non its upper part. Another line runs from it down the anterior aspect\r\nand forms the inner boundary of the very shallow musculo-spiral groove.\r\nThe nutrient foramen is about in the middle of the posterior surface. A\r\nslight elevation on the proximal third of the inner surface represents\r\nthe teres tubercle. The head is long and strongly curved from before\r\nbackward. The neck is better marked than in the horse. The undivided\r\nexternal tuberosity is placed well forward and extends little above the\r\nlevel of the head. The internal tuberosity is small. The bicipital\r\ngroove is undivided and is displaced to the inner side by the extension\r\nforward of the external tuberosity. The distal end bears an oblique\r\ntrochlear articular surface for articulation with the radius and ulna,\r\nthe outer part of which is the more extensive and is faintly grooved.\r\nThe epicondyles are prominent. The coronoid and olecranon fossæ often\r\ncommunicate through a large =supratrochlear foramen=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 130.—LEFT HUMERUS OF DOG, EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Head; _b_, neck; _c_, crest; _d_, external tuberosity; _e_, mark\r\n    for insertion of infraspinatus tendon; _f_, external condyle; _g_,\r\n    external condyloid crest; _h_, coronoid fossa; _i_, olecranon fossa.\r\n    (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d.

(Ellenberger-Baum,\r\n    Anat. d. Hundes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe two bones of the forearm are relatively long and articulate with\r\neach other at either end in such a manner as to allow of slight\r\nmovement. A narrow interosseous space separates their shafts. The\r\n=radius= is flattened from before backward and increases in size from\r\nabove downward. The shaft forms two curves; one of these, an anterior\r\nconvexity, involves the whole shaft; the other, an inner convexity,\r\naffects the upper part. The anterior surface is convex in both\r\ndirections and is marked by a groove for the oblique extensor of the\r\ncarpus. The posterior surface presents the nutrient foramen in its upper\r\nthird, and bears a rough line (Crista interossea) externally for the\r\nattachment of the interosseous ligament. The proximal end (Capitulum\r\nradii) is relatively small and is supported by a distinct neck (Collum\r\nradii). It bears a concave surface (Fovea capituli) above for\r\narticulation with the humerus, and a convex marginal area\r\n(Circumferentia articularis) behind for the ulna. The bicipital\r\ntuberosity is small. There is a large external tuberosity and below this\r\na rough eminence. The distal extremity is much wider. It has an\r\nextensive concave carpal articular surface. Its inner border projects\r\ndownward, forming the =styloid process= of the radius. Externally there\r\nis a concave facet (Incisura ulnaris radii) for the ulna. In front are\r\nthree distinct grooves for the extensor tendons. The =ulna= is well\r\ndeveloped, but diminishes in size from above downward. It crosses the\r\nposterior surface of the radius from within outward. The shaft is large\r\nand three-sided in its upper two-thirds, smaller and more rounded below.\r\nIts anterior surface is in general rough. The nutrient foramen is near\r\nthe proximal end. A vascular groove descends from it and indicates the\r\ncourse of the interosseous artery. The proximal end is relatively short.\r\nIt is concave and smooth internally, convex and rough externally. The\r\nolecranon is grooved and bears three prominences, of which the posterior\r\none is large and rounded. The semilunar notch is wide below and\r\ncompletes the surface for articulation with the trochlea of the humerus.\r\nBelow it is a concave surface (Incisura radialis) which articulates with\r\nthe back of the head of the radius, and below this is a fossa, which\r\nreceives a tuberosity of the radius. The distal end (Capitulum ulnæ) is\r\nsmall and is produced to a blunt point (Processus styloideus ulnæ). It\r\narticulates with the ulnar carpal below, and has a convex facet on its\r\nantero-internal aspect for the radius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 132.—SKELETON OF DISTAL PART OF THORACIC LIMB OF DOG, EXTERNAL\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _4_, Radial + intermediate carpal bone; _5_, ulnar carpal; _6_,\r\n    accessory carpal; _7_, second carpal; _8_, third carpal; _9_, fourth\r\n    carpal; _10–14_, first to fifth metacarpals; _15_, first phalanx;\r\n    _16_, second phalanx; _17_, third phalanx. (After Leisering’s\r\n    Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =carpus= comprises seven bones, three in the proximal row and four\r\nin the distal. The numerical reduction in the upper row is apparently\r\ndue to the fusion of the radial and intermediate, constituting a large\r\nbone which articulates with almost all of the distal surface of the\r\nradius and with the bones of the lower row. It projects prominently on\r\nthe posterior surface of the carpus. The ulnar carpal is long; it\r\narticulates with the radius and ulna above and the accessory behind;\r\nbelow it rests on the fourth carpal and is prolonged downward to\r\narticulate with the fifth metacarpal also. The accessory is cylindrical,\r\nconstricted in its middle and enlarged at each end; the anterior\r\nextremity articulates with the ulna and ulnar carpal bone. The first\r\ncarpal is the smallest bone of the lower row; it articulates with the\r\nsecond carpal externally and the first metacarpal distally. The second\r\ncarpal is wedge-shaped, the base being posterior; its upper surface is\r\nconvex, and its lower is concave and rests on the second metacarpal. The\r\nthird carpal is somewhat like the second; its lower surface is concave\r\nand articulates chiefly with the third metacarpal. The fourth carpal is\r\nthe largest of the row; it articulates with the fourth and fifth\r\nmetacarpals below. Two small bones or cartilages may be found at the\r\njunction of the two rows behind, and a third small bone articulates with\r\nthe inner side of the radiointermediate.[27]\r\n\r\nFive =metacarpal bones= are present. The first is much the shortest; the\r\nthird and fourth are the longest, and are about one-fifth longer than\r\nthe second and fifth. The fifth is the widest at the proximal end and is\r\nslightly shorter than the second. They are close together above, but\r\ndiverge somewhat below; the first is separated from the second by a\r\nconsiderable interosseous space. They are so arranged as to form a\r\nconvex dorsal surface, and a concave volar surface, which corresponds to\r\nthe hollow of the palm of the hand in man. Each consists of a shaft and\r\ntwo extremities. The shaft is compressed from before backward. In the\r\nthird and fourth it is almost four-sided, in the second and fifth\r\nthree-sided, in the first rounded. The proximal ends (Bases) articulate\r\nwith each other and with the corresponding carpal bones. The carpal\r\narticular surface formed by them is concave from side to side, convex\r\nfrom before backward. The distal ends (Capitula) have articular surfaces\r\nof the nature of a head, but bear a sagittal ridge behind, except the\r\nfirst, which is grooved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 133.—SECOND AND THIRD PHALANGES OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Wing of third phalanx; _b_, coronary ridge; _c_, foramen for\r\n    digital artery; _d_, ungual surface of third phalanx; _e_, second\r\n    phalanx; _f_, first phalanx; _g_, elastic dorsal ligaments. (From\r\n    Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe five =digits= have three phalanges each, except the first, which has\r\ntwo. The third and fourth digits are the longest; the first is very\r\nshort and does not come in contact with the ground in walking. The\r\n=first phalanges= of the chief digits have four-sided shafts, which are\r\nslightly curved forward. The proximal end of each has a concave surface\r\nfor articulation with the metacarpal bone and is deeply notched behind.\r\nThe distal end has a trochlea for articulation with the second phalanx,\r\nand lateral depressions for ligamentous attachment. The =second\r\nphalanges= are about two-thirds of the length of the first phalanges.\r\nThe proximal articular surface consists of two cavities separated by a\r\nsagittal ridge. The distal extremity is wider and flatter than that of\r\nthe first. The =third phalanges= correspond in general to the form of\r\nthe claws. The base has an articular surface adapted to the second\r\nphalanx and is encircled by a collar of bone. The volar surface bears a\r\nwing or tuberosity, and on either side of this is a foramen. The ungual\r\npart is a curved rod with a blunt-pointed free end. It is rough and\r\nporous. Its base forms with the collar previously mentioned a deep\r\ngroove, into which the proximal border of the claw is received. The two\r\nphalanges of the first digit resemble in arrangement the first and third\r\nphalanges of the other digits.\r\n\r\nNine =volar sesamoids= are usually present. Two are found at each\r\nmetacarpo-phalangeal joint of the chief digits. They are high and\r\nnarrow, articulate with the distal end of the metacarpal bone in front,\r\nand have a small facet on the base for the first phalanx. On this joint\r\nof the first digit there is usually a single flattened sesamoid, but\r\nexceptionally two are present. The distal volar sesamoids remain\r\ncartilaginous. A nodular =dorsal sesamoid= occurs in the anterior part\r\nof the capsule of the metacarpo-phalangeal joints, and cartilaginous\r\nnodules are found in a similar position in connection with the joints\r\nbetween the first and second phalanges.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        BONES OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =ilium= is nearly parallel with the median plane and its axis is\r\nonly slightly oblique with regard to the horizontal plane. The gluteal\r\nsurface is concave. The iliac surface is almost flat. The auricular\r\nsurface faces almost directly inward, and in front of it there is an\r\nextensive rough area. The ilio-pectineal line is very distinct and is\r\nuninterrupted. The anterior border or crest is strongly convex, thick,\r\nand rough. The internal angle is represented by a thickened part which\r\nbears two eminences, homologous with the posterior superior and\r\nposterior inferior iliac spines of man. The external angle also has two\r\nprominences, which are equivalent to the two anterior spines present in\r\nman. The shaft is almost sagittal and is compressed laterally. Above it\r\nis smooth and rounded, and below it bears a crest externally which\r\nterminates at a tuberosity in front of the acetabulum.\r\n\r\nThe =ischium= has a twisted appearance owing to the fact that its\r\nacetabular part is nearly sagittal while the posterior part is almost\r\nhorizontal. The two bones also diverge behind and the tubera are\r\nflattened and everted. The superior ischiatic spine is low and thick;\r\nits posterior part is marked by transverse grooves and has a prominent\r\nouter lip. There is no lesser sciatic notch. The ischial arch is\r\nrelatively small and is semi-elliptical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 134.—OSSA COXARUM OF DOG, LEFT POSTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_.

There is no subpubic groove.\r\n\r\nThe =acetabulum= is about twice as far from the external angle of the\r\nilium as from the tuber ischii. The fossa acetabuli is deep, and is\r\nbounded internally by a flat plate of bone; its floor is so thin as to\r\nbe translucent. There is a small notch behind.\r\n\r\nThe =obturator foramen= resembles in outline an equilateral triangle\r\nwith the angles rounded off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 137.—SKELETON OF DISTAL PART OF PELVIC LIMB OF DOG, EXTERNAL\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _6_, Tibial tarsal bone; _7_, fibular tarsal; _8_, central tarsal;\r\n    _9_, second tarsal; _10_, third tarsal; _11_, fourth tarsal; _12_,\r\n    metatarsal bones; _13_, first phalanx. The first tarsal bone is not\r\n    visible in the figure. (After Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe inlet of the =pelvis= is very oblique. It is almost circular in the\r\nfemale, but in the male it is elliptical and the conjugate diameter is\r\nthe longer. The cavity is narrowest between the acetabula, and very wide\r\nbehind. The floor is concave and relatively narrow in front, wide and\r\nflat behind.\r\n\r\nThe =femur= is relatively much longer than in the horse or ox. The shaft\r\nis regularly cylindrical, except near the extremities, where it is wider\r\nand compressed from before backward. It is strongly curved in its lower\r\ntwo-thirds, convex in front. The posterior surface is flattened\r\ntransversely, narrow in the middle, and widens toward each end. It is\r\nbounded by two rough lines (Labium laterale, mediale) which diverge\r\ntoward the extremities. The third trochanter and the plantar\r\n(supracondyloid) fossa are absent. There are two supracondyloid crests,\r\nthe inner one being small. The nutrient foramen is in the upper third of\r\nthe posterior surface. The head is a little more than a hemisphere and\r\nhas a shallow depression behind and external to its center. The neck is\r\nwell defined. The trochanter major does not extend as high as the head;\r\na thick ridge runs from its anterior surface to the neck. The internal\r\ntrochanter has the form of a blunt tuberosity. The trochanteric fossa is\r\nround and deep. The ridges of the trochlea are practically sagittal in\r\ndirection and are almost similar. The intercondyloid fossa is wide. Just\r\nabove each condyle posteriorly there is a facet for articulation with\r\nthe sesamoid (of Vesal), which is developed in the origin of the\r\ngastrocnemius muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =tibia= is about the same length as the femur. The shaft forms a\r\ndouble curve; the upper part is convex internally, the lower part\r\nexternally. The proximal third is prismatic, but is compressed laterally\r\nand is long from before backward. The remainder is almost regularly\r\ncylindrical. The crest is short but very prominent. The nutrient foramen\r\nis usually in the upper third of the external border. The tuberosity is\r\nnot grooved, but bears a distinct mark where the ligamentum patellæ is\r\nattached. There is a small facet for the fibula on the postero-external\r\npart of the external condyle, and a small sesamoid bone in the tendon of\r\norigin of the popliteus is in contact with the posterior angle of the\r\nlatter. The distal end is quadrangular and relatively small. The\r\narticular grooves and ridge are almost sagittal. There is a facet\r\nexternally for articulation with the fibula. There is a vertical groove\r\ninternally and a shallower one behind—both for tendons.\r\n\r\nThe =fibula= extends the entire length of the region. It is slender,\r\nsomewhat twisted, and enlarged at either end. The upper part of the\r\nshaft is separated from the tibia by a considerable interosseous space,\r\nbut the lower part is flattened and closely applied to the tibia. The\r\nproximal end is flattened and articulates with the external condyle of\r\nthe tibia. The distal end is somewhat thicker and forms the external\r\nmalleolus. It articulates internally with the tibia and the tibial\r\ntarsal bone. Externally it bears two tubercles.\r\n\r\nThe =patella= is long and narrow. The anterior surface is convex in both\r\ndirections. The articular surface is convex from side to side and\r\nslightly concave from above downward.\r\n\r\nThe =tarsus= comprises seven bones. The tibial tarsal consists of a\r\nbody, neck, and head, like the bone in man. The body presents a trochlea\r\nabove for articulation with the tibia and fibula. The posterior surface\r\nhas three facets for articulation with the fibular tarsal bone. The head\r\nis directed a little inward and articulates with the central. The\r\nfibular tarsal has a long anterior process or “beak,” but the inner\r\nprocess (sustentaculum) is short. The tuber calcis is grooved from\r\nbefore backward. The central has a concave proximal surface adapted to\r\nthe head of the tibial tarsal. Its distal surface articulates with the\r\nfirst, second, and third tarsals. It bears two tubercles posteriorly.\r\nThe first tarsal is flattened and irregularly quadrangular; it\r\narticulates above with the central and below with the first metatarsal.\r\nThe second tarsal is the smallest and is wedge-shaped; it articulates\r\nbelow with the second metatarsal bone. The third tarsal is also\r\nwedge-shaped, the base being in front; it articulates with the third\r\nmetatarsal below. The fourth tarsal is remarkably high, and resembles a\r\nquadrangular prism; it articulates with the fibular tarsal above, the\r\nfourth and fifth metatarsal below, and the central and third tarsal\r\nbones internally. A groove for the tendon of the peroneus longus crosses\r\nits outer and posterior surface, and above it are one or two tubercles.\r\n\r\nFive =metatarsal bones= are present. The first is commonly very small\r\nand has the form of a blunt cone, somewhat compressed laterally. It\r\narticulates with the first tarsal and furnishes insertion to the\r\ntibialis anterior muscle. In some cases it fuses with the first tarsal;\r\nwhen the first digit is well developed, its metatarsal may resemble the\r\nothers (except in size) or be reduced in its proximal part to a fibrous\r\nband. The other metatarsals are a little longer than the corresponding\r\nmetacarpals. Their proximal ends are elongated from before backward and\r\nhave posterior projections, which in the case of the third and fourth\r\nusually bear facets for articulation with two small rounded sesamoid\r\nbones. In other respects they resemble the metacarpals.\r\n\r\nThe first digit is often absent. When present, its development varies\r\nand it contains one or two phalanges. In other cases the digit is\r\ndouble. The phalanges of the other digits resemble those of the fore\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ARTHROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE ARTICULATIONS OR JOINTS\r\n\r\nAn =articulation= or =joint= is formed by the union of two or more bones\r\nor cartilages by other tissue. Bone is the fundamental part of most\r\njoints; in some cases a bone and a cartilage, or two cartilages, form a\r\njoint. The uniting medium is chiefly fibrous tissue or cartilage, or a\r\nmixture of these. Union of parts of the skeleton by muscles\r\n(Synsarcosis), as in the attachment of the thoracic limb in the horse,\r\nwill not be considered in this section.\r\n\r\nJoints may be classified—(_a_) anatomically, according to their mode of\r\ndevelopment, the nature of the uniting media, and the form of the joint\r\nsurfaces; (_b_) physiologically, with regard to the amount and kind of\r\nmovement or the absence of mobility in them; (_c_) by a combination of\r\nthe foregoing considerations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The classification of joints is still in a very unsatisfactory state,\r\n  and, unfortunately, the same term is used in various senses by\r\n  different authors. The two main subdivisions proposed by Hepburn are:\r\n  (1) Those in which the uniting medium is coextensive with the opposed\r\n  joint surfaces, and in which a direct union of these surfaces is\r\n  thereby effected. (2) Those in which the uniting medium has undergone\r\n  interruption in its structural continuity, and in which a cavity of\r\n  greater or less extent is thus formed in the interior of the joint.\r\n  This distinction is of considerable importance clinically.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree chief subdivisions of joints are usually recognized—viz.,\r\n=synarthroses=, =diarthroses=, and =amphiarthroses=.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SYNARTHROSES\r\n\r\nIn this group the segments are united by fibrous tissue or cartilage, or\r\na mixture of the two in such a manner as practically to preclude\r\nmovement; hence they are often termed fixed or immovable joints. There\r\nis no joint cavity. Many of these joints are temporary, the uniting\r\nmedium being invaded by the process of ossification, with a resulting\r\nankylosis or synostosis. The chief classes in this group of joints are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n(1) =Suture.=—This term (Sutura) is applied to those joints in the skull\r\nin which the adjacent bones are closely united by fibrous tissue—the\r\nsutural ligament. In many cases the edges of the bones have irregular\r\ninterlocking margins, forming the =sutura serrata=, _e. g._, the frontal\r\nsuture. In others the edges are beveled and overlap, forming the =sutura\r\nsquamosa=, _e. g._, the parieto-temporal suture. If the edges are plane\r\nor slightly roughened, the term =sutura harmonia= is applied to the\r\njoint, _e. g._, the nasal suture.\r\n\r\n(2) =Synchondrosis.=—In these the two bones are united by cartilage, _e.\r\ng._, the joint between the basioccipital and the sphenoid bone. Very few\r\nof these joints are permanent.\r\n\r\n(3) =Symphysis.=—This term is usually limited to a few median joints\r\nwhich connect symmetrical parts of the skeleton, _e. g._, symphysis\r\npelvis, symphysis mandibulæ. The uniting media are cartilage and fibrous\r\ntissue. In some cases a cleft-like rudimentary joint cavity occurs.\r\n\r\n(4) =Gomphosis.=—This term is applied to the implantation of the teeth\r\nin the alveoli.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DIARTHROSES\r\n\r\nThese joints are characterized by the presence of a joint cavity and by\r\ntheir mobility. They are often called movable or true joints. The\r\nstructures which enter into their formation are:\r\n\r\n1. The =joint surfaces= (Facies articulares), which are usually more or\r\nless expanded. They are in most cases smooth, and vary much in form.\r\nThey are formed of specially dense bone, which differs histologically\r\nfrom ordinary compact substance. In certain cases (_vide_ Osteology) the\r\nsurface is interrupted by non-articular cavities known as =synovial\r\nfossæ=.\r\n\r\n2. The =articular cartilages= (Cartilagines articulares), usually\r\nhyaline in type, form a covering over the articular surfaces of the\r\nbones. They vary in thickness in different joints; they are thickest on\r\nthe areas of the greatest pressure, and usually tend to accentuate the\r\ncurvature of the bone, _i. e._, on a concave surface the peripheral part\r\nis the thickest, while on a convex surface the central part is the\r\nthickest. The articular cartilages are non-vascular, very smooth, and\r\nhave a bluish tinge in the fresh state. They diminish the effects of\r\nconcussion and greatly reduce friction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 138.—DIAGRAM OF SECTION OF DIARTHROSIS.\r\n\r\n  _f.l._, Fibrous layer, _s.l._, synovial layer of joint capsule. The\r\n    articular cartilages are white, bones dotted, and the joint cavity\r\n    black in the figure.\r\n]\r\n\r\n3. The =joint capsule= (Capsula articularis) is, in its simplest form, a\r\nsac, the margins of which are attached around the articulating surfaces.\r\nIt consists of two layers—an external one, composed of fibrous tissue\r\n(Stratum fibrosum), and an internal one, the synovial layer or membrane\r\n(Stratum synoviale). The =fibrous layer=, sometimes termed the capsular\r\nligament, is attached either close to the margins of the articular\r\nsurfaces or at a variable distance from them. Its thickness varies\r\ngreatly in different situations: in certain places it is extremely\r\nthick, and sometimes cartilage or bone develops in it; in other places\r\nit is practically absent, the capsule then consisting only of the\r\nsynovial membrane. Parts of the capsule may undergo thickening and so\r\nform ligaments, which are not separable, except artificially, from the\r\nrest of the capsule. The =synovial layer= lines the joint cavity except\r\nwhere this is bounded by the articular cartilages; it stops normally at\r\nthe margin of the latter. It is a thin membrane, and is richly supplied\r\nby close networks of vessels and nerves. It frequently forms =folds=\r\n(Plicæ synoviales) and =villi= (Villi synoviales), which project into\r\nthe cavity of the joint. The folds commonly contain pads of fat which\r\nfill up interstices and vary in form and position in various phases of\r\nmovement. The synovial membrane secretes a fluid, the =synovia=, which\r\nresembles white-of-egg and lubricates the joint.[28] In many places the\r\nmembrane forms extra-articular pouches, which facilitate the play of\r\nmuscles and tendons.\r\n\r\nThe =joint cavity= (Cavum articulare) is inclosed by the synovial\r\nmembrane and the articular cartilages. Normally, it is, strictly\r\nspeaking, only a potential cavity, which contains nothing but a small\r\namount of synovia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The student must guard against a false conception of the joint cavity\r\n  which may result from dissections and diagrams, in which an actual\r\n  cavity of considerable extent appears to exist. A correct idea of the\r\n  intimate apposition of the parts is best obtained from the study of\r\n  frozen sections. It is also instructive to examine joints which have\r\n  been injected so as to distend the capsule fully. It is then seen that\r\n  the cavity is often of much greater potential extent than one might\r\n  suppose, and that the capsule is often very irregular in form, _i.\r\n  e._, forms a variety of sacculations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are constant and necessary features in all diarthroses.\r\nOther structures which enter into the formation of these joints are\r\nligaments, articular discs or menisci, and marginal cartilages.\r\n\r\n4. =Ligaments.=—These are strong bands or membranes, usually composed of\r\nwhite, fibrous tissue, which bind the bones together. They are pliable,\r\nbut practically inelastic. In a few cases, however, _e. g._, ligamenta\r\nflava, ligamentum nuchæ, they are composed of elastic tissue. They may\r\nbe subdivided, according to position, into =periarticular= and\r\n=intraarticular=. Periarticular ligaments are frequently blended with or\r\nform part of the fibrous capsule; in other cases they are quite\r\ndistinct. Strictly speaking, intraarticular ligaments, though within the\r\nfibrous capsule, are not in the joint cavity; the synovial membrane is\r\nreflected over them. The term seems justifiable, however, on practical\r\ngrounds. Ligaments which connect directly opposed surfaces of bones are\r\ntermed interosseous. The special names are based usually on their\r\nposition, form, and attachments, _e. g._, lateral or collateral,\r\ncruciate, sacro-iliac, etc. In many places muscles, tendons, and\r\nthickenings of the fasciæ function as ligaments and increase the\r\nsecurity of the joint. Atmospheric pressure and cohesion play a\r\nconsiderable part in keeping the joint surfaces in apposition.\r\n\r\n5. =Articular discs= or =menisci= are plates of fibro-cartilage or dense\r\nfibrous tissue placed between the articular cartilages, and divide the\r\njoint cavity partially or completely into two compartments. They render\r\ncertain surfaces congruent, _e. g._, femoro-tibial joint, allow greater\r\nrange or variety of movement, and diminish concussion.\r\n\r\n6. A =marginal cartilage= (Labrum glenoidale) is a ring of\r\nfibro-cartilage which encircles the rim of an articular cavity. It\r\nenlarges the cavity and tends to prevent fracture of the margin.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =arteries= form anastomoses around the larger\r\njoints, and give off branches to the extremities of the bones and to the\r\njoint capsule. The synovial membrane has a close-meshed network of\r\ncapillaries; the latter form loops around the margins of the articular\r\ncartilages, but do not usually enter them. The =veins= form plexuses.\r\nThe synovial membrane is also well supplied with lymphatics.\r\nNerve-fibers are especially numerous in and around the synovial membrane\r\nand there are special nerve-endings, _e. g._, Pacinian bodies and the\r\narticular end-bulbs described by Krause.\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—The movements of a joint are determined chiefly by the form\r\nand extent of the joint surfaces and the arrangement of the ligaments.\r\nThey are usually classified as follows:\r\n\r\n1. =Gliding.=—This refers to the sliding of one practically plane\r\nsurface on another, as in the joints between the articular processes of\r\nthe cervical vertebræ.\r\n\r\n2. =Angular Movements.=—In these cases there is movement around one or\r\nmore axes. Motion which diminishes the angle included by the segments\r\nforming the joint is termed =flexion=, while that which tends to bring\r\nthe segments into line with each other is called =extension=.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the joints of the lower parts of the limbs, it seems\r\nadvisable to employ the terms =dorsal= and volar or =plantar flexion=,\r\nsince these joints can be “overextended.” Similarly, the terms =dorsal=\r\nand =ventral flexion= should be applied to the corresponding movements\r\nof the spinal column. The meaning of the term =lateral flexion= is\r\nevident. These movements are all rotations around axes which are\r\napproximately either transverse or vertical. Depression, elevation, and\r\nlateral movement of the lower jaw fall in this category.\r\n\r\n3. =Circumduction.=—This designates movements in which the distal part\r\nof the limb describes a circle or a segment of one. In man such movement\r\nis easily performed, but in quadrupeds it is possible to a limited\r\ndegree only, and is to be regarded usually as an indication of disease.\r\n\r\n4. =Rotation.=—As a matter of convenience, this term is reserved to\r\nindicate rotation of one segment around the longitudinal axis of the\r\nother segment forming the joint. It is seen typically in the\r\natlanto-axial joint.\r\n\r\n5. =Adduction= and =abduction= designate respectively movement of a limb\r\ntoward and away from the median plane, or of a digit toward and away\r\nfrom the axis of the limb.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=—This is based on the form of the joint surfaces and\r\nthe movements which occur. The following chief classes may be\r\nrecognized:\r\n\r\n1. =Arthrodia=, or gliding joint. In these the surfaces are practically\r\nflat, admitting of gliding movement. Examples: carpo-metacarpal joints;\r\njoints between the articular processes of the cervical and thoracic\r\nvertebræ.\r\n\r\n2. =Ginglymus=, or hinge-joint. In this class the joint surfaces consist\r\nusually of two condyles, or of a segment of a cylinder or cone, which\r\nare received by corresponding cavities. In typical cases the movements\r\nare flexion and extension, _i. e._, around a single transverse axis.\r\nExamples: occipito-atlantal and elbow joints.\r\n\r\n3. =Trochoid=, or pivot joint. In these the movement is limited to\r\nrotation of one segment around the longitudinal axis of the other.\r\nExample: atlanto-axial joint.\r\n\r\n4. =Enarthrosis=, or ball-and-socket joint. These are formed by a\r\nsurface of approximately spherical curvature, received into a\r\ncorresponding cavity. They are multiaxial, and allow of the greatest\r\nvariety of movement, _e. g._, flexion, extension, rotation, abduction,\r\nadduction, circumduction. Examples: hip and shoulder joints.[29]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AMPHIARTHROSES\r\n\r\nThese joints, as the name indicates, share some characters with both of\r\nthe preceding groups. In them the segments are directly united by a\r\nplate of fibro-cartilage, and usually by ligaments also. The amount and\r\nkind of movement are determined by the shape of the joint surfaces and\r\nthe amount and pliability of the uniting medium.[30] These joints are\r\nall medial in position, and are best illustrated by the joints between\r\nthe bodies of the vertebræ. There is usually no joint cavity, but in\r\ncertain situations a rudimentary one exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                  JOINTS AND LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRÆ\r\n\r\nThe movable vertebræ form two sets of articulations, viz., those formed\r\nby the bodies, and those formed by the articular processes of adjacent\r\nvertebræ; the former are termed =intercentral=, and the latter,\r\n=interneural=. Associated with these are ligaments uniting the arches\r\nand processes; some of these are =special=, _i. e._, confined to a\r\nsingle joint, while others are =common=, _i. e._, extend along the\r\nentire vertebral column or a considerable part of it. The joints between\r\nthe atlas and axis and between the former and the skull require separate\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       INTERCENTRAL ARTICULATIONS\r\n\r\nThese are =amphiarthroses=, formed by the junction of the extremities of\r\nthe bodies of adjacent vertebræ. The =articular surfaces= in the\r\ncervical region consist of a cavity on the posterior end of the body of\r\nthe anterior vertebra, and a corresponding convexity or head of the\r\nsucceeding vertebra. In the other regions the surfaces are much\r\nflattened. The uniting media are:\r\n\r\n1. The =intervertebralfibro-cartilages= (Fibrocartilagines\r\nintervertebrales). Each of these is a disc which fits into the space\r\nbetween the bodies of two adjacent vertebræ, to which it is intimately\r\nattached. The discs are thinnest in the middle of the thoracic region,\r\nthicker in the cervical and lumbar regions, and thickest in the\r\ncoccygeal region. Each consists of a dense fibrous peripheral part\r\n(Annulus fibrosus), and a soft pulpy central part (Nucleus pulposus).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 139.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF LAST TWO THORACIC AND FIRST LUMBAR\r\n    VERTEBRÆ, SHOWING LIGAMENTS AND SPINAL CORD (MEDULLA). (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fibrous ring consists of laminæ of fibrous tissue and\r\n  fibro-cartilage, which pass obliquely between the two vertebræ and\r\n  alternate in direction, forming an X-shaped arrangement. The central\r\n  part of the ring is largely cartilaginous, and gradually assumes the\r\n  character of the pulpy center. The latter is very elastic and is\r\n  compressed, so that it bulges considerably from the surface of\r\n  sections; it consists of white and elastic fibers, connective-tissue\r\n  cells, and peculiar clear, transparent cells of various sizes. It is a\r\n  remnant of the notochord. There are joint cavities in the cervical\r\n  intercentral joints, and in those between the last cervical and the\r\n  first thoracic, and between the last lumbar and the sacrum. In the\r\n  latter the cavity is coextensive with the extremities of the bodies;\r\n  in the former, it is usually not so extensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The =inferior common ligament= (Ligamentum longitudinale ventrale)\r\nlies on the ventral surface of the bodies of the vertebræ and the\r\nintervertebral fibro-cartilages, to which it is firmly attached. It\r\nbegins about the fourteenth or fifteenth thoracic vertebra, and is at\r\nfirst a narrow, thin band. Further back it becomes gradually thicker and\r\nwider, and terminates on the pelvic surface of the sacrum by spreading\r\nout and blending with the periosteum. It is strongest in the lumbar\r\nregion, where the tendons of the crura of the diaphragm fuse with it.\r\n\r\n3. The =superior common ligament= (Ligamentum longitudinale dorsale)\r\nlies on the floor of the vertebral canal from the dens or odontoid\r\nprocess to the sacrum. It is narrow over the middles of the vertebral\r\nbodies, and widens over the intervertebral fibro-cartilages, to which it\r\nis very firmly attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This ligament is in relation with the spinal veins on either side, and\r\n  in the middle of each vertebra a transverse anastomotic branch passes\r\n  under the ligament.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       INTERNEURAL ARTICULATIONS\r\n\r\nEach typical vertebra presents two pairs of articular processes, which\r\nform diarthroses with the two adjacent vertebræ. The =articular\r\nsurfaces= are extensive, flat, and oval in the cervical region, small\r\nand flat in the thoracic region, while in the lumbar region the anterior\r\nones are concave and the posterior convex. The joint capsule is strong\r\nand ample in the cervical region, in conformity with the large size and\r\ngreater mobility of these joints in the neck. In the thoracic and lumbar\r\nregions the capsule is small and close. These joints are arthrodia.\r\n\r\nAssociated with these joints are the =ligamenta flava=, which connect\r\nthe arches of adjacent vertebræ. They are membranous and consist largely\r\nof elastic tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 140.—LIGAMENTUM NUCHÆ OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Scapula; _1′_, cartilage of scapula; _4_, lamellar part of\r\n    ligamentum nuchæ; _x_, wing of atlas. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat.\r\n    für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =supraspinous ligament= extends medially from the occipital bone to\r\nthe sacrum. From the withers backward it consists of a strong cord of\r\nfibrous tissue, attached to the summits of the vertebral spines. In the\r\nneck and withers it is remarkably modified to form the ligamentum nuchæ,\r\nwhich requires more extended notice.\r\n\r\nThe =ligamentum nuchæ= is a powerful elastic apparatus, the principal\r\nfunction of which is to assist the extensor muscles of the head and\r\nneck. It extends from the occipital bone to the withers, where it is\r\ndirectly continuous with the supraspinous ligament. It consists of two\r\nparts—funicular and lamellar. The =funicular part= (Pars occipitalis)\r\narises from the external occipital protuberance and the fossa below it,\r\nand is inserted into the summits of the vertebral spines at the withers.\r\nTwo =bursæ= are usually found under it in the adult. The =supra-atloid\r\nbursa= lies between the ligament and the dorsal arch of the atlas. The\r\n=supraspinous bursa= occurs usually over the fourth thoracic spine, but\r\nmay be over the third and may extend to the fifth.[31] In the neck the\r\nfunicular part consists for the greater part of two bands closely\r\napplied and attached to each other. Near and at the withers it broadens\r\ngreatly, forming an expansion three to five inches (ca. 8 to 12.5 cm.)\r\nin width, the lateral margins of which are thin and overlie the\r\ntrapezius and rhomboideus muscles. Behind the higher spines it becomes\r\nnarrower and thinner, and is continued by the white fibrous lumbo-dorsal\r\nligament.[32] A mass of fat and elastic tissue lies upon the ligament as\r\nfar back as the withers. It varies greatly in amount in different\r\nsubjects, and is most developed in stallions of draft breeds, in which\r\nit forms the basis of the “crest.” The =lamellar portion= (Pars\r\ncervicalis) consists of two laminæ separated medially by a layer of\r\nloose connective tissue. Each lamina is formed of digitations which\r\narise from the second and third thoracic spines and from the funicular\r\nportion, are directed downward and forward, and end on the spines of the\r\ncervical vertebræ, except the first and last. The digitation which is\r\nattached to the spine of the axis is very thick and strong. Behind this\r\nthey diminish in size and strength; that to the sixth cervical is quite\r\nthin and feeble, or may be absent.\r\n\r\nThe =interspinous ligaments= (Ligamenta interspinalia) extend between\r\nthe spines of contiguous vertebræ. In the cervical region they are\r\nnarrow elastic bands, and in the thoracic and lumbar regions they\r\nconsist of white fibers directed obliquely downward and forward.\r\n\r\nThe =intertransverse ligaments= (Ligamenta intertransversaria) are\r\nmembranes which connect adjacent transverse processes in the lumbar\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     INTERTRANSVERSE ARTICULATIONS\r\n\r\nThese joints (peculiar to equidæ) are diarthroses formed by the\r\ntransverse processes of the last two lumbar vertebræ and the alæ of the\r\nsacrum. A similar joint between the fourth and fifth lumbar processes is\r\nfrequently present. The =articular surfaces= have an elongated oval\r\nform, the anterior one being concave and the posterior one convex. The\r\ncapsule is tight, and is reinforced ventrally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SACRAL AND COCCYGEAL ARTICULATIONS\r\n\r\nIn the foal the bodies of the five sacral vertebræ form joints which\r\nresemble somewhat those in the posterior part of the lumbar region.\r\nThese joints are invaded by the process of ossification early, so that\r\nthe consolidation of the sacrum is usually complete, or nearly so, at\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\nThe coccygeal vertebræ are united by relatively thick intervertebral\r\nfibro-cartilages, which have the form of biconcave discs. Special\r\nligaments are not present, but there is a continuous sheath of fibrous\r\ntissue. The movement in this region is extensive and varied. In old\r\nhorses the first coccygeal vertebra is often fused with the sacrum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   MOVEMENTS OF THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN\r\n\r\nThe movements of the spine, exclusive of those at the atlanto-axial\r\njoint, are dorsal, ventral, and lateral flexion, and rotation. The range\r\nof movement at a single joint is very small, but the sum of the\r\nmovements is considerable. The movements are freest in the cervical and\r\ncoccygeal regions. Rotation is extremely limited in the thoracic and\r\nlumbar regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ATLANTO-AXIAL ARTICULATION\r\n\r\nThis is a trochoid or pivot joint, of a rather peculiar character. The\r\narticular surfaces are: (1) On the lateral masses of the atlas, two\r\nsomewhat saddle-shaped facets, which are usually confluent ventrally;\r\n(2) on the axis, reciprocal saddle-shaped surfaces which extend upon the\r\nodontoid process and are confluent on its ventral aspect. It will be\r\nobserved that the joint surfaces are not at all accurately adapted to\r\neach other, so that only limited areas are in contact at any time.\r\n\r\nThe =joint capsule= is attached around the margins of the articular\r\nsurfaces. It is loose and ample enough laterally to allow extensive\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe =superior atlanto-axial ligament= (Ligamentum interarcuale) is\r\nmembranous and reinforces the capsule dorsally.\r\n\r\nThe =interspinous ligament= (Ligamentum inter-spinale) consists of two\r\nelastic bands which extend from the dorsal arch of the atlas to the\r\nspine of the axis.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior atlanto-axial ligament= (Ligamentum dentis externum)\r\narises from the ventral tubercle of the atlas and is attached by two\r\nbranches on the ventral spine of the axis.\r\n\r\nThe =odontoid ligament= (Ligamentum dentis internum) is short, very\r\nstrong, and somewhat fan-shaped. It extends from the rough concave\r\ndorsal surface of the dens or odontoid process, widens in front, and is\r\nattached to the transverse rough area on the inner surface of the\r\nventral arch of the atlas.\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—The atlas and the head rotate upon the axis; the axis of\r\nrotation passes through the center of the odontoid process and body of\r\nthe axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 141.—ATLANTO-OCCIPITAL AND ATLANTO-AXIAL JOINTS OF HORSE, DORSAL\r\n    VIEW AFTER REMOVAL OF DORSAL ARCH OF ATLAS.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Joint capsule of left part of atlanto-occipital joint; _b_,\r\n    lateral ligament of same; _c_, _c′_, odontoid ligament; _d_,\r\n    atlanto-occipital joint capsule; _e_, joint capsule of articulation\r\n    between axis and third cervical vertebra; _f_, interspinous\r\n    ligament; _1_, occipital bone; _2_, atlas; _3_, axis; _4_, third\r\n    cervical vetrebra. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE ATLANTO-OCCIPITAL ARTICULATION\r\n\r\nThis joint may be classed as a ginglymus. The =articular surfaces= of\r\nthis joint are: (1) On the atlas, two deep oval cavities; (2) the\r\ncorresponding condyles of the occipital bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The joint surfaces are oblique, coming very close to the median line\r\n  ventrally, but separated by a considerable interval dorsally.\r\n  Posteriorly, a triangular rough area cuts into the middle of each\r\n  articular surface on the atlas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two roomy =joint capsules=, which sometimes communicate\r\nventrally, especially in old subjects.\r\n\r\nThe =superior atlanto-occipital membrane= extends from the dorsal arch\r\nof the atlas to the upper margin of the foramen magnum. It is blended\r\nwith the capsules and contains many elastic fibers.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior atlanto-occipital membrane= extends from the ventral arch\r\nof the atlas to the lower margin of the foramen magnum. It is narrower\r\nand thinner than the superior membrane, and also fuses with the joint\r\ncapsules.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral ligaments= are two short bands which are partially blended\r\nwith the capsules. Each is attached to the border of the wing of the\r\natlas near the intervertebral foramen, and to the outer surface of the\r\nparamastoid or styloid process of the occipital bone.\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—These are chiefly flexion and extension. A small amount of\r\nlateral oblique movement is also possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ARTICULATIONS OF THE THORAX\r\n\r\n\r\n                     COSTO-VERTEBRAL ARTICULATIONS\r\n\r\nEach typical rib forms two joints with the vertebral column, one by its\r\nhead, and one by its tubercle. They are termed respectively\r\ncosto-central and costo-transverse joints.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 142.—COSTO-VERTEBRAL ARTICULATION, ANTERIOR VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nI. The =costo-central articulations= (Articulationes capitulorum) are\r\ntrochoid or rotatory joints, formed by the junction of the head of the\r\nrib with the bodies of two adjacent vertebræ and the intervertebral\r\nfibro-cartilage. The two facets on the head of the rib are separated by\r\na non-articular groove, and correspond to the two concave facets (Foveæ\r\ncostales) on the vertebral bodies. The capsules are rather tight, and\r\nare covered by the accessory ligaments, which are as follows: 1. The\r\n=radiate ligament= (Ligamentum capituli costæ radiatum) extends\r\nventrally from the neck of the rib to spread out on the vertebral bodies\r\nand the intervertebral fibro-cartilage. 2. The =conjugal ligament=\r\n(Ligamentum conjugale)—absent from the first joint—is attached to the\r\ngroove on the head of the rib, passes transversely into the vertebral\r\ncanal, and divides under the superior common ligament into two branches;\r\none of these is attached to the body of the anterior vertebra; the other\r\nis continued across to the head of the opposite rib, and is attached to\r\nthe intervertebral fibro-cartilage. The joint cavity is divided into two\r\ncompartments by the conjugal ligament. 3. The =ligament of the neck= of\r\nthe rib (Ligamentum colli costæ) is a strong band which crosses the\r\njoint dorsally. It is attached on the vertebra above the costal facet\r\nand on the neck of the rib.\r\n\r\nII. The =costo-transverse articulations=. These occur between the\r\nfacets on the tubercles of the ribs and those on the transverse\r\nprocesses of the vertebræ. They are gliding joints. The =capsule= is\r\nreinforced by the =superior costo-transverse ligament= (Ligamentum\r\ncosto-transversarium dorsale), a distinct strong band which arises on\r\nthe transverse process and ends on the non-articular part of the\r\ntubercle. It is covered by the levator costæ muscle, and begins to be\r\nquite distinct at the fifth joint.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The cavity for the head of the first rib is formed by concave facets\r\n  on the bodies of the last cervical and first thoracic vertebræ. The\r\n  conjugal ligament is absent, but the ligament of the neck is short and\r\n  strong. The radiate ligament is very strong, and consists of two\r\n  bands. In the case of the last two or three ribs the costo-central and\r\n  costo-transverse joints are confluent, and the various structures are\r\n  correspondingly modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—The chief movement is rotation around an axis which\r\nconnects the centers of the head and tubercle of the rib. The movement\r\nis very limited in the anterior part of the series of joints, but very\r\nconsiderable in the posterior part.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the case of the first rib, the movement is evidently extremely\r\n  limited. The facet for the tubercle of the rib is deeply concave, and\r\n  the axis of rotation is almost transverse. Further back the facets on\r\n  the transverse processes become flat, and the axis of rotation\r\n  gradually approaches a longitudinal direction. This, in connection\r\n  with the mobility of the ventral ends of the asternal ribs and their\r\n  elasticity, allows a great increase here in the range of movement, the\r\n  effect of which is to enlarge (chiefly) the transverse diameter of the\r\n  thorax.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      COSTO-CHONDRAL ARTICULATIONS\r\n\r\nThe costo-chondral junctions are synarthroses. The rib has a concave\r\nsurface which receives the convex end of the cartilage. They are united\r\nby the continuity of the strong periosteum and perichondrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CHONDRO-STERNAL ARTICULATIONS\r\n\r\nThese joints (Articulationes sternocostales) are diarthroses formed by\r\nthe junction of the cartilages of the sternal ribs with the sternum. The\r\narticular ends of the cartilages (except the first) are somewhat\r\nenlarged, and present surfaces of cylindrical curvature. The articular\r\nsurfaces on the sternum for the first pair of cartilages are placed\r\nclose together on the dorsal border of the cariniform cartilage\r\n(Manubrium sterni); the other seven are placed laterally at the junction\r\nof the segments. The capsules are strong and tight; the first pair of\r\njoints has a common capsule, and the cartilages articulate with each\r\nother medially. The lower ends of the first pair of ribs are firmly\r\nattached to each other by dense fibrous tissue, which is prolonged\r\nforward along the upper margin of the cariniform cartilage and is\r\ncontinuous behind with the sternal ligament. Each of the other capsules\r\nis reinforced dorsally by the =superior costo-sternal ligament=\r\n(Ligamentum sternocostale radiatum), composed of radiating fibers which\r\nblend with the sternal ligament. The movement is rotation around a\r\nnearly vertical axis, except in the case of the first pair of joints.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        INTERCHONDRAL LIGAMENTS\r\n\r\nThe eighth and ninth costal cartilages are firmly united by fibrous\r\ntissue. The chondro-xiphoid ligament attaches the ninth costal cartilage\r\nto the xiphoid cartilage. The remaining cartilages are rather loosely\r\nattached to each other by elastic tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         STERNAL ARTICULATIONS\r\n\r\nIn the new-born foal the sternum has seven bony segments (Sternebræ),\r\nunited by persisting cartilage. The last two segments coalesce within a\r\nfew weeks after birth. In old subjects there is more or less\r\nossification of the intersegmental cartilage, which may lead to partial\r\nfusion of adjacent segments, especially posteriorly. The =sternal\r\nligament= (Ligamentum sterni proprium internum) lies on the thoracic\r\nsurface of the sternum. It arises on the first segment, and divides\r\nopposite the second chondro-sternal joint into three bands. The median\r\nband passes backward and spreads out on the last segment and the xiphoid\r\ncartilage. The lateral branches—thicker and wider—lie along the lateral\r\nborders above the chondro-sternal joints, and end at the cartilage of\r\nthe eighth rib; they are covered by the transversus thoracis muscle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE SKULL\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TEMPORO-MANDIBULAR ARTICULATION\r\n\r\nThis joint (Articulatio mandibularis) is the only diarthrosis formed\r\nbetween bones of the skull.\r\n\r\nThe =articular surfaces= are dissimilar in form and size. That on the\r\nsquamous temporal bone is concavo-convex, and the long axis is directed\r\noutward and somewhat forward; it consists of a glenoid cavity, which is\r\ncontinued upon the postglenoid process behind, and a condyle in front.\r\nThe mandible presents a transversely elongated condyle.\r\n\r\nThe =articular disc= is placed between the joint surfaces, which it\r\nrenders congruent. Its upper and lower surfaces are molded upon the\r\ntemporal and mandibular surfaces respectively, and its circumference is\r\nattached to the joint capsule; thus it divides the joint cavity into\r\nupper and lower compartments, the former being the more roomy.\r\n\r\nThe =joint capsule= is strong and tight. It is reinforced by two\r\nligaments. The =external ligament= (Ligamentum laterale) extends\r\nobliquely across the anterior part of the outer surface of the capsule,\r\nfrom which it is not distinctly separable. The =posterior ligament=\r\n(Ligamentum posterius) is an elastic band which is attached above to the\r\npostglenoid process, and below to a line on the posterior face of the\r\nneck of the mandible.\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—The chief movements take place around a transverse axis\r\npassing through both joints. Associated with this hinge-like action is\r\nslight gliding movement, as in opening and shutting the mouth. When the\r\nmouth is shut, the condyle lies under the glenoid cavity. When the\r\nmandible is depressed, the condyle moves forward under the articular\r\neminence of the temporal bone, carrying the disc with it. In protrusion\r\nand retraction of the lower jaw the gliding movement just described\r\noccurs without the hinge-like rotation of the condyle. These movements\r\nare similar in both joints. In the lateral movements (as usually\r\nperformed in mastication) the action consists of rotation of the\r\ncondyles around a vertical axis, while the disc glides forward on one\r\nside and backward on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE SYNARTHROSES OF THE SKULL\r\n\r\nMost of the bones of the skull are united with the adjacent bones by\r\n=sutures=; a few are united by cartilage. The difference in the uniting\r\nmedium depends on the fact that most of these bones are developed in\r\nmembrane, but some are preformed in cartilage. Most of these joints are\r\ntemporary, and are obliterated at various periods during development and\r\ngrowth. Their importance rests on the fact that so long as they persist,\r\ncontinuous growth is possible. They are usually designated according to\r\nthe bones which enter into their formation, _e. g._, spheno-squamous,\r\nnaso-frontal, internasal, etc. Special names (borrowed from human\r\nanatomy) are sometimes used; thus the interparietal, the\r\nparieto-occipital, and the parieto-frontal sutures are often called the\r\nsagittal, lambdoid, and coronal respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Detailed description of the sutures has not sufficient clinical value\r\n  to justify much addition to the statements made in the osteology in\r\n  this connection. The obliteration or closure of the sutures is,\r\n  however, worthy of brief mention. The cranial sutures are usually all\r\n  closed at seven years, but the apex only of the petrous temporal is\r\n  fused with the occipital and squamous temporal. Most of the facial\r\n  sutures are practically closed at ten years, although complete\r\n  synostosis may in some be delayed for years or may not occur at all;\r\n  the nasal suture, for example, often persists even in advanced age, so\r\n  far as its anterior part is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal =synchondroses= are: (1) That between the basioccipital\r\nand the body of the sphenoid (Synchondrosis sphenooccipitalis); (2) that\r\nbetween the presphenoid and postsphenoid (Synchondrosis\r\nintersphenoidalis); (3) those between the parts of the occipital bone\r\n(Synchondroses intraoccipitales). The first is usually ossified at four\r\nyears, the second at three years, and the occipital bone is consolidated\r\nat two years.\r\n\r\nThe =symphysis= of the lower jaw (Symphysis mandibulæ) ossifies at one\r\nto six months.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE HYOIDEAN ARTICULATIONS\r\n\r\nThe =temporo-hyoid articulation= is an amphiarthrosis, in which the\r\ndorsal angle of the proximal end of the great cornu (Stylo-hyal) is\r\nattached by a short bar of cartilage to the hyoid process of the petrous\r\ntemporal bone. The cartilage (Arthrohyal) is about half an inch (ca. 1\r\nto 1.5 cm. ) in length. The chief movement is hinge-like, the axis of\r\nmotion passing transversely through both joints.\r\n\r\nThe =intercornual articulation= is an amphiarthrosis formed by the\r\njunction of the distal extremity of the great cornu with the proximal\r\nend of the small cornu (kerato-hyal). They are united by a very short\r\npiece of cartilage, in which there is usually a small nodule of bone in\r\nthe young subject. This nodule, the epihyal or middle cornu, is usually\r\nfused with the great cornu in the adult. The chief movement here is also\r\nhinge-like, the angle between the cornua being increased or diminished.\r\n\r\nThe =basi-cornual articulation= is a diarthrosis formed by the junction\r\nof each small cornu (kerato-hyal) with the body (basi-hyal). The small\r\ncornu has a concave facet which articulates with the convex facet on\r\neither end of the dorsal surface of the body. The capsule is ample\r\nenough to allow considerable movement, which is chiefly hinge-like. The\r\nmovements of the hyoid bone are concerned chiefly in the acts of\r\nmastication and swallowing. In the latter the distal parts of the hyoid\r\nbone are moved forward and upward, carrying the root of the tongue and\r\nthe larynx with them, and then return to their former position.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the clavicle the thoracic limb forms no articulation\r\nwith the trunk, unless we regard as such the union by muscles. The\r\nmovement of the shoulder on the chest-wall is chiefly rotation around a\r\ntransverse axis passing through the scapula behind the upper part of the\r\nspine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SHOULDER JOINT\r\n\r\nThe shoulder or scapulo-humeral joint (Articulatio scapulo-humeralis) is\r\nformed by the junction of the distal end of the scapula with the\r\nproximal end of the humerus. The =articular surfaces= are: (1) On the\r\nscapula, the glenoid cavity; (2) on the humerus, the head. Both surfaces\r\nare approximately spherical and similar in curvature, but the humeral\r\nsurface is much more extensive than that of the scapula.\r\n\r\nThe =joint capsule= is ample enough to allow the bones to be drawn apart\r\nabout an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.); but this requires a very considerable\r\namount of force unless air is admitted into the joint cavity. The\r\nfibrous layer (or capsular ligament) is not attached to the margin of\r\nthe joint surfaces, but at a distance of one to two centimeters from it.\r\nIt is strengthened in front by two diverging elastic bands, which arise\r\non the scapular tuberosity and end on the lips of the bicipital groove.\r\nA pad of fat is interposed between the capsule and the tendon of the\r\nbiceps.\r\n\r\nLigaments are absent from this joint, but the muscles and tendons around\r\nit afford remarkable security, so that dislocation seldom or never\r\noccurs. The large extent of the head of the humerus is also of\r\nimportance in this regard.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The principal muscles which are attached around the joint and act as\r\n  ligaments are: externally, the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres\r\n  minor; internally, the subscapularis; in front, the biceps and\r\n  supraspinatus; behind, the triceps.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—While it is a typical enarthrosis in structure, and capable\r\nof the various movements of the ball-and-socket joint, the chief normal\r\nmovements are flexion and extension. In the position of rest the angle\r\nformed between the scapula and humerus posteriorly is about 110° to\r\n120°; in flexion it is reduced to about 80°, and in extension it is\r\nincreased to about 145°. Adduction and abduction are very restricted,\r\nthe former being limited chiefly by the infraspinatus, the latter by the\r\nsubscapularis and the low insertion of the superficial pectoral muscles.\r\nRotation is somewhat freer, but does not exceed 33°, when all the\r\nmuscles are removed (Franck).\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE ELBOW JOINT\r\n\r\nThis, the cubital articulation (Articulatio cubiti), is a ginglymus\r\nformed between the distal extremity of the humerus and the proximal ends\r\nof the bones of the forearm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 143.—LEFT ELBOW JOINT OF HORSE, POSTERIOR VIEW. THE CAPSULE IS\r\n    REMOVED. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =articular surfaces= are: (1) A trochlear surface formed by the\r\ncondyles of the humerus and the groove between them; (2) the\r\ncorresponding glenoid cavities and ridge on the proximal extremity of\r\nthe radius, together with the semilunar notch of the ulna.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The articular surface of the condyles does not extend upon the back of\r\n  the extremity, but the groove which receives the semilunar notch of\r\n  the ulna extends up into the olecranon fossa. In the fore part of the\r\n  groove there is a synovial fossa. The surface on the outer condyle is\r\n  smaller than that of the inner one, and is subdivided into two unequal\r\n  parts by a shallow furrow. On the lower part of the semilunar notch\r\n  and the adjacent part of the ridge on the radius are synovial fossæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =joint capsule= is extremely thin behind, where it forms a pouch in\r\nthe olecranon fossa under the anconeus muscle and a pad of fat. In front\r\nit is strengthened by oblique fibers (Ligamentum obliquum or anterior\r\nligament), and laterally it fuses with the lateral ligaments. Small\r\npouches of the =synovial membrane= lubricate the origins of the flexors\r\nof the carpus and digit and the small radio-ulnar joints. There are two\r\nlateral ligaments.\r\n\r\nThe =internal lateral ligament= (Ligamentum collaterale radiale) is\r\nattached above to an eminence on the internal epicondyle of the humerus,\r\nand divides into two parts: the long, superficial part ends on the inner\r\nborder of the radius, just below the level of the interosseous space;\r\nthe deep, short part is inserted into the internal tuberosity of the\r\nradius. (The superficial part represents the pronator teres muscle,\r\nwhich is only exceptionally present in the horse.)\r\n\r\nThe =external lateral ligament= (Ligamentum collaterale ulnare) is short\r\nand strong. It is attached above to a depression on the external\r\nepicondyle of the humerus, and below to the external tuberosity of the\r\nradius, just below the margin of the articular surface.\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—This joint is a typical ginglymus, the only movements being\r\nflexion and extension around an axis which passes through the upper\r\nattachments of the lateral ligaments. In the standing position the\r\narticular angle (in front) is about 140° to 150°. The range of movement\r\nis about 55° to 60°. Complete extension is prevented chiefly by the\r\ntension of the lateral ligaments and the biceps muscle. (The axis of\r\nmovement is slightly oblique, so that in flexion the forearm is carried\r\nsomewhat outward.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 144.—LEFT CARPAL JOINTS OF HORSE, EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The capsule has been removed, _g_, Radius; _12_, large metacarpal\r\n    bone.

The smaller ligaments are shown. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. f. Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE RADIO-ULNAR ARTICULATION\r\n\r\nIn the foal the shaft of the ulna is attached to the radius above and\r\nbelow the interosseous space by the =interosseous ligament=. Below the\r\nspace the two bones become fused before adult age is reached. Above the\r\nspace the ligament usually persists, but may undergo more or less\r\nossification in extreme old age. The =transverse= or =arciform\r\nligaments= (Ligamentum transversum ulnare et radiale ulnæ et radii)\r\nconsist of fibers which pass above the interosseous space from either\r\nborder of the shaft of the ulna to the posterior surface of the radius.\r\nThe proximal radio-ulnar articulation, formed by two small convex facets\r\non the ulna and the corresponding facets on the posterior surface of the\r\nproximal extremity of the radius, is inclosed in the capsule of the\r\nelbow joint and does not require separate consideration. The distal\r\nextremity of the ulna fuses early with the radius, and is, therefore,\r\nregarded usually as a part of the latter.\r\n\r\n=Movement.=—This is inappreciable, the forearm being fixed in the\r\nposition of pronation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CARPAL JOINTS\r\n\r\nThese joints taken together constitute the composite =articulatio\r\ncarpi=, or what is popularly termed the “knee-joint” in animals.[33]\r\nThis consists of three chief joints, viz., (1) The =radio-carpal joint=,\r\nformed by the distal end of the radius and the proximal row of the\r\ncarpus; (2) the =intercarpal joint=, formed between the two rows of the\r\ncarpus; (3) the =carpo-metacarpal joint=, formed between the distal row\r\nof the carpus and the proximal ends of the metacarpal bones. The\r\nproximal and middle joints may be regarded as ginglymi, although they\r\nare not typical or pure examples of hinge-joints. The distal joint is\r\narthrodial. In addition there are arthrodial joints formed between\r\nadjacent bones of the same row (Articulationes interosseæ). All these\r\nconstitute a very composite joint, with numerous ligaments. The\r\narticular surfaces have been described in the Osteology.\r\n\r\nThe =joint capsule= may be regarded, so far as the fibrous part is\r\nconcerned, as being common to all three joints. It is attached close to\r\nthe margin of the articular surface of the radius above and the\r\nmetacarpus below; its deep face is also attached to a considerable\r\nextent to the carpal bones and to the small ligaments. Its anterior\r\npart, the =dorsal= or =anterior common ligament=, is rather loose, and\r\nassists in forming the fibrous canals for the extensor tendons. Its\r\nposterior part, the =volar= or =posterior common ligament=, is very\r\nthick and dense, and is closely attached to the carpal bones. It levels\r\nup the irregularities of the skeleton here, and forms the smooth\r\nanterior wall of the carpal canal. It is continued downward to form the\r\n=subcarpal= or =inferior check ligament=, which blends with the tendon\r\nof the flexor perforans about the middle of the metacarpus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 146.—FRONTAL SECTION OF CARPAL JOINTS OF HORSE (RIGHT SIDE).\r\n\r\n  _l.u._, External, _l.r._, internal, lateral ligament; _Cr_, radial\r\n    carpal; _Ci_, intermediate carpal; _Cu_, ulnar carpal; _C2_, second\r\n    carpal; _C3_, third carpal; _C4_, fourth carpal; _Mc2_, second\r\n    (internal) metacarpal; _Mc3_, third (large) metacarpal; _Mc4_,\r\n    fourth (external) metacarpal.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =synovial membrane= forms three sacs corresponding to the three\r\njoints. The =radio-carpal sac= is the most voluminous; it includes the\r\njoints formed by the accessory carpal bone, and also those between the\r\nproximal carpal bones as far as the interosseous ligaments. The\r\n=intercarpal sac= sends extensions upward and downward between the bones\r\nof the two rows as far as the interosseous ligaments; it communicates\r\nbetween the third and fourth carpal bones with the =carpo-metacarpal\r\nsac=. The latter is very limited in extent, and is closely applied to\r\nthe bones; it incloses the carpo-metacarpal joint, and lubricates also\r\nthe lower parts of the joints between the distal carpal bones and the\r\nintermetacarpal joints.\r\n\r\nThe =external lateral ligament= (Ligamentum carpi collaterale ulnare) is\r\nattached above to the external tuberosity of the distal end of the\r\nradius. Its long superficial part is attached below to the proximal end\r\nof the external small metacarpal chiefly, but some fibers end on the\r\nlarge metacarpal bone. A canal for the lateral extensor tendon separates\r\na short deep band which ends on the ulnar carpal bone. Other deep fibers\r\nconnect the latter with the fourth carpal bone, and the fourth carpal\r\nwith the metacarpus.\r\n\r\nThe =internal lateral ligament= (Ligamentum carpi collaterale radiale)\r\nresembles the preceding in general, but is stronger and wider distally.\r\nIt is attached above to the internal tuberosity of the distal end of the\r\nradius and ends below on the proximal ends of the large and inner small\r\nmetacarpal bones. Deep fasciculi are detached to the radial and second\r\ncarpal bones. The first carpal bone, when present, is usually embedded\r\nin the posterior part of the distal end of the ligament. The posterior\r\npart of the ligament is fused with the posterior annular ligament\r\n(Ligamentum carpi transversum), and concurs in the formation of a canal\r\nfor the tendon of the flexor carpi internus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A number of special short ligaments connect two or more adjacent\r\n  bones; only the most distinct of these will be described here.\r\n\r\n  The accessory carpal bone is connected with adjacent bones by three\r\n  ligaments (Fig. 444). The proximal one is a short band which extends\r\n  from the accessory carpal in front of the groove on its outer face and\r\n  is inserted into the distal end of the radius behind the groove for\r\n  the lateral extensor tendon. A middle band connects the accessory with\r\n  the ulnar carpal. The distal ligament consists of two strong bands\r\n  which pass from the lower margin of the accessory to the fourth carpal\r\n  and the proximal end of the outer metacarpal bone; these bands\r\n  transmit the action of the muscles, which are inserted into the\r\n  accessory carpal bone. The other bones of the proximal row are\r\n  connected by two anterior or dorsal ligaments, which are transverse in\r\n  direction, and two interosseous ligaments. An oblique ligament passes\r\n  from an eminence on the posterior surface of the radial carpal bone to\r\n  a small depression on the radius internal to the facet for the\r\n  accessory carpal bone.\r\n\r\n  Two ligaments connect the proximal and distal rows posteriorly. The\r\n  inner one joins the radial to the second and third carpal, and the\r\n  outer one attaches the ulnar to the third and fourth carpals.\r\n\r\n  The bones of the distal row are connected by two strong transverse\r\n  anterior or dorsal ligaments and two interosseous ligaments.\r\n\r\n  There are four carpo-metacarpal ligaments. Two oblique anterior bands\r\n  connect the third carpal with the large metacarpal. Two interosseous\r\n  ligaments pass downward from the interosseous ligaments of the distal\r\n  row to end in depressions in the interstices between the proximal ends\r\n  of the metacarpal bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 147.—LEFT CARPAL JOINTS OF HORSE, INNER VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _g_, Radius; _12_, large (third) metacarpal bone. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—Taking the joint as a whole, the chief movements are\r\nflexion and extension. In the standing position the joint is extended.\r\nWhen the joint is flexed, slight lateral movement and rotation can be\r\nproduced by manipulation. The anterior part of the capsule is, of\r\ncourse, tense during flexion, the posterior part in extension.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The movement practically all occurs at the radio-carpal and\r\n  intercarpal joints, the articular surfaces of which are widely\r\n  separated in front during flexion, but remain in contact behind. The\r\n  distal row remains in contact with the metacarpus. The intermediate\r\n  and ulnar carpals move together as one piece, but the radial does not\r\n  move so far as the intermediate, so that the anterior and interosseous\r\n  ligaments connecting these bones become tense and oblique in\r\n  direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FETLOCK JOINT\r\n\r\nThis, the =metacarpo-phalangeal articulation= (Articulatio\r\nmetacarpo-phalangea), is a ginglymus formed by the junction of the\r\ndistal end of the large (third) metacarpal bone, the proximal end of the\r\nfirst phalanx, and the proximal sesamoid bones.\r\n\r\n=Articular Surfaces.=—The surface on the large metacarpal bone is\r\napproximately cylindrical in curvature, but is divided into two slightly\r\nunequal parts by a sagittal ridge. This is received into a sort of\r\nsocket formed by the first phalanx below and the two sesamoids together\r\nwith the intersesamoid ligament behind. The latter is a mass of\r\nfibro-cartilage in which the sesamoid bones are largely embedded. It\r\nextends above the level of the sesamoids, and is grooved to receive the\r\nridge on the metacarpal bone; its posterior surface forms a smooth\r\ngroove for the deep flexor tendon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 148.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF DISTAL PART OF LIMB OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Large metacarpal bone; _3_, fetlock joint; _4_, proximal sesamoid\r\n    bone; _5_, first phalanx; _6_, pastern joint; _7_, second phalanx;\r\n    _8_, coffin joint; _9_, third phalanx; _10_, distal sesamoid\r\n    (navicular bone); _12_, suspensory ligament; _14_, deep flexor\r\n    tendon; _15_, superficial flexor tendon; _16_, posterior annular\r\n    ligament of fetlock; _20_, inferior sesamoidean ligaments; _21_,\r\n    extensor tendon; _24_, plantar cushion; _25_, periople; _28_, wall\r\n    of hoof; _29_, sole of hoof; _A_, navicular bursa, proximal part.\r\n    (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 149.—ARTICULAR SURFACES OF FIRST PHALANX AND SESAMOIDS AT\r\n    FETLOCK, WITH INTERSESAMOID AND SUSPENSORY LIGAMENTS. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =joint capsule= is attached around the margin of the articular\r\nsurfaces. It is thick and ample in front; here a bursa is interposed\r\nbetween it and the extensor tendons, but the tendons are also attached\r\nto the capsule. Posteriorly it forms a thin-walled pouch which extends\r\nupward between the metacarpal bone and the suspensory ligament about as\r\nhigh as the point of bifurcation of the latter. The capsule is\r\nreinforced by two lateral ligaments.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral ligaments=, =external= and =internal= (Ligamentum\r\ncollaterale ulnare, radiale) are partially divided into two layers: the\r\n=superficial layer= arises from the eminence on the side of the distal\r\nend of the large metacarpal bone, and passes straight to the rough\r\nlateral area below the margin of the articular surface of the first\r\nphalanx; the =deep layer=, shorter and much stronger, arises in the\r\nlateral depression on the distal end of the metacarpal bone, and passes\r\nobliquely downward and backward to be inserted into the outer surface of\r\nthe sesamoid and the proximal end of the first phalanx.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The capsule is further strengthened by a layer of oblique fibers which\r\n  pass over the lateral ligament on either side and end on the extensor\r\n  tendon and the proximal extremity of the first phalanx. It may\r\n  properly be regarded as fascia rather than ligament.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 150.—LIGAMENTS AND TENDONS OF DISTAL PART OF LIMB OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  Mc.III, Large metacarpal bone; Ph.I, first phalanx; Ph.II, second\r\n    phalanx; Ph.III, third phalanx; 1, deep flexor tendon; 2, band from\r\n    first phalanx to plantar cushion. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d.\r\n    Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—These are of the nature of flexion and extension, the axis\r\nof motion passing through the upper attachments of the lateral\r\nligaments. In the ordinary standing position the joint is in a state of\r\npartial =dorsal flexion=, the articular angle (in front) being about\r\n140° to 150°. (In the hind limb it is about 5° greater.) Diminution of\r\nthis angle (sometimes termed “overextension”) is normally very limited\r\non account of the resistance offered by the sesamoidean apparatus, but\r\nit varies considerably in amount in different subjects. =Volar flexion=\r\nis limited only by contact of the heels with the metacarpus. During\r\nvolar flexion a small amount of lateral flexion is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE SESAMOIDEAN LIGAMENTS\r\n\r\nUnder this head will be described a number of important ligaments which\r\nare connected with the sesamoid bones and form a sort of stay apparatus\r\nor brace.\r\n\r\nThe =intersesamoidean ligament= (Ligamentum intersesamoideum) not only\r\nfills the space between and unites the sesamoid bones, but also extends\r\nabove them, entering into the formation of the articular surface of the\r\nfetlock joint. Other facts in regard to it have been given above.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral sesamoidean ligaments=, outer and inner (Ligamenta\r\nsesamoidea ulnare et radiale), arise on the abaxial surface of each\r\nsesamoid bone, pass forward, and divide into two branches, one of which\r\nends in the depression on the distal end of the large metacarpal bone,\r\nthe other on the eminence on the proximal end of the first phalanx. They\r\nare partly covered by the branches of the suspensory or superior\r\nsesamoidean ligament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 151.—DEEP DISSECTION OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF HORSE,\r\n    SHOWING JOINTS AND LIGAMENTS, POSTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  1, Lateral cartilage; 2, tendon surface of navicular bone; 3, inferior\r\n    navicular or interosseous ligament; 4, insertion of deep flexor\r\n    tendon. Small arrows point to openings made in capsules of pastern\r\n    and coffin joints. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =suspensory= or =superior sesamoidean ligament= (Musculus\r\ninterosseus medius) lies for the greater part in the metacarpal groove,\r\nwhere it has the form of a wide, thick band. It is attached above to the\r\nupper part of the posterior surface of the large metacarpal bone and to\r\nthe distal row of carpal bones. At the lower fourth of the metacarpus it\r\ndivides into two diverging branches. Each branch passes to the abaxial\r\nface of the corresponding sesamoid, on which a considerable part, is\r\nattached. The remainder passes obliquely downward and forward to the\r\nanterior surface of the first phalanx, where it joins the extensor\r\ntendon. This ligament possesses considerable elasticity, and is the\r\nhighly modified interosseous medius muscle. It consists mainly of\r\ntendinous tissue, but contains a variable amount of striped muscular\r\ntissue, especially in its deep part and in young subjects. Its principal\r\nfunction is to support the fetlock, _i. e._, to prevent excessive dorsal\r\nflexion of the joint when the weight is put on the limb. The branches\r\nwhich join the common extensor tendon limit volar flexion of the\r\ninterphalangeal joints in certain phases of movement.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior sesamoidean ligaments= are three in number—superficial,\r\nmiddle, and deep. The =superficial= or =straight ligament= (Ligamentum\r\nsesamoideum rectum) is a flat band and is somewhat wider above than\r\nbelow.[34] It is attached above to the bases of the sesamoid bones and\r\nthe intersesamoid ligament, below to the complementary fibro-cartilage\r\nof the proximal end of the second phalanx. The =middle ligament= is\r\ntriangular, with thick, rounded margins (Ligamenta obliqua) and a thin\r\ncentral portion.[35] Its base is attached to the sesamoid bones and\r\nintersesamoid ligament, and its deep face to the triangular rough area\r\non the posterior surface of the first phalanx. The =deep= or =cruciate\r\nligament= (Ligamenta sesamoidea cruciata) consists of two thin layers of\r\nfibers which arise on the base of the sesamoid bones, cross each other,\r\nand end on the opposite eminence on the proximal end of the first\r\nphalanx.\r\n\r\nThe =short sesamoidean ligaments= (Ligamenta sesamoidea brevia) are best\r\nseen by opening the joint in front and pushing the sesamoid bones\r\nbackward; they are covered by the synovial membrane. Each is a short\r\nband which extends from the anterior part of the base of the sesamoid\r\nbone outward to the posterior margin of the articular surface of the\r\nfirst phalanx.\r\n\r\nThe inferior sesamoidean ligaments may be regarded as digital\r\ncontinuations of the suspensory ligament, the sesamoid bones being\r\nintercalated in this remarkable stay apparatus by which the fetlock is\r\nsupported and concussion diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PASTERN JOINT\r\n\r\nThis, the =proximal interphalangeal articulation= (Articulatio phalangis\r\nsecundæ), is a ginglymus formed by the junction of the distal end of the\r\nfirst phalanx and the proximal end of the second phalanx.\r\n\r\nThe =articular surfaces= are: (1) On the first phalanx, two slightly\r\nunequal convex areas with an intermediate shallow groove; (2) on the\r\nsecond phalanx, a corresponding surface, completed behind by a plate of\r\nfibro-cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =joint capsule= is close fitting in front and laterally, where it\r\nblends with the extensor tendon and the lateral ligaments respectively.\r\nBehind it pouches upward a little and is reinforced by the straight\r\nsesamoidean ligament and the branches of the superficial flexor tendon.\r\n\r\nThere are two lateral and four volar ligaments.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral ligaments=, internal and external (Ligamentum collaterale\r\nradiale, ulnare) are very short and strong bands which are attached\r\nabove on the eminence and depression on each side of the distal end of\r\nthe first phalanx, and below on the eminence on either side of the\r\nproximal end of the second phalanx. The direction of the ligaments is\r\nabout vertical and, therefore, does not correspond to the digital axis.\r\n\r\nThe =volar= or =posterior ligaments= consist of central and lateral\r\npairs of bands which are attached below to the posterior margin of the\r\nproximal end of the second phalanx and its complementary\r\nfibro-cartilage. The lateral pair is attached above to the middle of the\r\nborders of the first phalanx, the central pair lower down and on the\r\nmargin of the triangular rough area.\r\n\r\n\r\n  These ligaments are very commonly thickened as a result of chronic\r\n  inflammation, and then are not well defined. The central ones blend\r\n  below with the branches of the superficial flexor tendon and with the\r\n  straight sesamoidean ligament.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—These are very limited, and consist of flexion and\r\nextension. The axis of motion passes transversely through the distal end\r\nof the first phalanx. In the standing position the joint is extended. A\r\nsmall amount of volar flexion is possible, and in this position slight\r\nlateral flexion and rotation can be produced by manipulation. Dorsal\r\nflexion is prevented by the lateral, volar, and straight sesamoidean\r\nligaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE COFFIN JOINT\r\n\r\nThis joint, technically termed the =distal interphalangeal articulation=\r\n(Articulatio phalangis tertiæ), is a ginglymus formed by the junction of\r\nthe second and third phalanges and the third sesamoid bone.\r\n\r\n=Articular Surfaces.=—The surface on the distal end of the second\r\nphalanx is convex from before backward, concave transversely. The\r\narticular surface of the third phalanx slopes sharply upward and\r\nforward; its central part is prominent, and is flanked by two glenoid\r\ncavities. It is completed behind by the articular surface of the third\r\nsesamoid or navicular bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 152.—LATERAL LIGAMENTS OF PASTERN JOINT AND SUSPENSORY LIGAMENTS\r\n    OF NAVICULAR BONE. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Joint Capsule.=—This is attached around the margins of the articular\r\nsurfaces. In front and laterally it is tight, and is blended with the\r\nextensor tendon and the lateral ligaments respectively. Posteriorly, it\r\nforms a considerable pouch which extends upward to about the middle of\r\nthe second phalanx, where it is separated by a fibrous membrane from the\r\ndigital synovial sheath. Laterally small pouches project outward\r\n(especially during volar flexion) against the lateral cartilages, just\r\nbehind the lateral ligaments.[36]\r\n\r\n=Ligaments.=—The =lateral ligaments=, external and internal (Ligamentum\r\ncollaterale ulnare, radiale), are short strong bands which are attached\r\nabove in the depressions on either side of the lower part of the second\r\nphalanx, under cover of the lateral cartilage. They widen below and end\r\nin the depressions on either side of the extensor process and on the\r\nanterior end of the lateral cartilages.\r\n\r\nThe =suspensory navicular ligaments=, external and internal (Ligamentum\r\nsesamoideum collaterale ulnare, radiale),[37] are strong, somewhat\r\nelastic bands, which form a sort of suspensory apparatus for the third\r\nsesamoid. They are attached superiorly in and above the depressions on\r\neither side of the distal end of the first phalanx and are here partly\r\nblended with the lateral ligaments of the pastern joint. They are\r\ndirected obliquely downward and backward, and end chiefly on the ends\r\nand proximal border of the third sesamoid, but detach a branch to the\r\ninner surface of each lateral cartilage and wing of the third phalanx.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior navicular ligament= (Ligamentum phalangeo-sesamoideum)\r\nreinforces the capsule interiorly. It is a strong layer of fibers which\r\nextend from the distal border of the third sesamoid to the tendon\r\nsurface of the third phalanx, near the posterior margin of the articular\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—The chief movements are flexion and extension. In the\r\nstanding position the joint is extended. During volar flexion a very\r\nsmall amount of lateral movement and rotation can be produced by\r\nmanipulation. Dorsal flexion is very limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dorsal flexion appears to be checked mainly by the deep flexor tendon,\r\n  since in cases of rupture of the latter the toe turns up. The slight\r\n  mobility of the posterior part of the socket for the second phalanx\r\n  (formed by the third sesamoid) diminishes concussion when the weight\r\n  comes on the foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  LIGAMENTS OF THE LATERAL CARTILAGES\r\n\r\nIn addition to the bands mentioned above, which attach the lateral\r\ncartilages to the extremities of the navicular bone, there are three\r\nligaments on either side which attach the cartilages to the phalanges.\r\n\r\nAn ill-defined elastic band passes from the middle part of the border of\r\nthe first phalanx to the upper part of the cartilage, detaching a branch\r\nto the plantar cushion.\r\n\r\nA short strong band connects the anterior extremity of the cartilage\r\nwith the rough eminence on the second phalanx in front of the attachment\r\nof the lateral ligament of the coffin joint.\r\n\r\nThe lower border of the cartilage is covered externally by fibers which\r\nattach it to the wing of the third phalanx.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE SACRO-ILIAC ARTICULATION\r\n\r\nThis joint (Articulatio sacro-iliaca) is a diarthrosis formed between\r\nthe auricular surfaces of the sacrum and ilium. These surfaces are not\r\nsmooth in the adult, but are marked by eminences and depressions, and\r\nare covered by a thin layer of cartilage. The joint cavity is a mere\r\ncleft, and is often crossed by fibrous bands.\r\n\r\nThe =capsule= is very close fitting, and is attached around the margins\r\nof the articular surfaces. It is reinforced by the =ventral sacro-iliac\r\nligament= (Ligamentum sacro-iliacum ventrale), which surrounds the\r\njoint, and is exceedingly strong above.\r\n\r\nThe =movements= are inappreciable in the adult—stability, not mobility,\r\nbeing the chief desideratum.\r\n\r\nThe following ligaments may be regarded as accessory to the joint,\r\nalthough not directly connected with it.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal sacro-iliac ligament= (Ligamentum sacro-iliacum dorsale\r\nbreve) is a strong band which is attached to the internal angle (Tuber\r\nsacrale) of the ilium and the summits of the sacral spines.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral sacro-iliac ligament= (Ligamentum sacro-iliacum dorsale\r\nlongum) is a triangular, thick sheet which is attached in front to the\r\ninternal angle and border of the ilium above the great sciatic notch,\r\nand below to the lateral border of the sacrum. It blends above with the\r\ndorsal sacro-iliac ligament, below with the sacro-sciatic ligament, and\r\nbehind with the coccygeal fascia.\r\n\r\nThe =sacro-sciatic ligament= (Ligamentum sacrospinosum et tuberosum) is\r\na quadrilateral sheet which completes the lateral pelvic wall. Its upper\r\nborder is attached to the border of the sacrum and the transverse\r\nprocesses of the first and second coccygeal vertebræ. Its lower border\r\nis attached to the superior ischiatic spine and tuber ischii. Between\r\nthese it bridges over the external border of the ischium and completes\r\nthe lesser sciatic foramen. The anterior border is concave, and\r\ncompletes the greater sciatic foramen. The posterior border is fused\r\nwith the vertebral head of the semimembranosus muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =ilio-lumbar ligament= (Ligamentum ilio-lumbale) is a triangular\r\nsheet which attaches the ends of the lumbar transverse processes to the\r\nventral surface of the ilium below the attachment of the longissimus\r\nmuscle (Fig. 184).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 153.—LEFT OS COXÆ AND ADJACENT PARTS OF SACRUM AND FEMUR OF\r\n    HORSE. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d.

In the young subject the bones are united by\r\na layer of cartilage; in the adult the latter is gradually replaced by\r\nbone, the process beginning in the pubic portion and extending backward.\r\nThe union is strengthened by white fibrous tissue above and below, and a\r\ntransverse band also covers the anterior border of the pubis (pecten).\r\nNo appreciable movement occurs even before synostosis takes place.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           OBTURATOR MEMBRANE\r\n\r\nThis (Membrana obturatoria) is a thin layer of fibrous tissue which\r\ncovers the obturator foramen, leaving, however, a passage (Canalis\r\nobturatorius) for the obturator vessels and nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE HIP JOINT\r\n\r\nThis joint (Articulatio coxæ) is an enarthrosis formed by the proximal\r\nend of the femur and the acetabulum.\r\n\r\n=Articular Surfaces.=—The head of the femur presents an almost\r\nhemispherical articular surface, which is continued a short distance on\r\nthe upper surface of the neck. It is more extensive than the socket\r\nwhich receives it. Internally it is cut into by a deep notch for the\r\nattachment of the round and pubo-femoral ligaments. The acetabulum is a\r\ntypical cotyloid cavity. Its articular surface is somewhat crescentic,\r\nbeing deeply cut into internally by the acetabular notch and fossa. It\r\nis increased and deepened by a ring of fibro-cartilage, the =cotyloid\r\nligament= (Labrum glenoidale), which is attached to the bony margin;\r\nthat part of the ligament which crosses the notch is called the\r\n=transverse ligament= (Fig. 456).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 154.—PELVIC LIGAMENTS AND HIP JOINT.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Dorsal sacro-iliac ligament; _2_, lateral sacro-iliac ligament;\r\n    _3_, sacro-sciatic ligament; _4_, greater sciatic foramen; _5_,\r\n    lesser sciatic foramen; _6_, line of attachment of intermuscular\r\n    septum between biceps femoris and semitendinosus; _7_, capsule of\r\n    hip joint; _8_, rectus parvus or capsularis muscle; _9_, outer\r\n    tendon of origin of biceps femoris; _10_, internal, _11_, external,\r\n    angle of ilium; _12_, shaft of ilium; _13_, superior ischiatic\r\n    spine; _14_, pubis; _15_, tuber ischii; _16_, trochanter major;\r\n    _17_, semimembranosus; _18_, fifth lumbar spine; _19_, _20_, first\r\n    and second coccygeal vertebræ.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =joint capsule= is roomy. It is attached around the margin of the\r\nacetabulum and the neck of the femur. It is thickest externally.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The attachment on the femur is about 1 cm. from the margin of the\r\n  articular surface, except above, where 2 to 3 cm. of the neck is\r\n  intracapsular. A thin oblique band corresponding in direction with the\r\n  rectus parvus muscle reinforces the antero-external part of the\r\n  capsule; this appears to be the feeble homologue of the very strong\r\n  ilio-femoral ligament of man. The capsule is very thin under the\r\n  ilio-psoas, and is adherent to the muscle. Internally, its fibrous\r\n  part is perforated by the pubo-femoral and round ligaments and the\r\n  articular vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =round ligament= (Ligamentum teres) is a strong hand which is\r\nattached in the subpubic groove close to the acetabular notch, passes\r\noutward, and ends in the notch on the head of the femur (Fig. 456).\r\n\r\nThe =pubo-femoral ligament= (Ligamentum accessorium) does not occur in\r\nthe domestic animals other than the equidæ. It is a strong band detached\r\nfrom the prepubic tendon of the abdominal muscles (Fig. 456). It is\r\ndirected outward, backward, and upward, passes through the acetabular\r\nnotch above the transverse ligament, and ends behind the round ligament\r\nin the notch on the head of the femur. The origin of the pectineus\r\nmuscle is perforated by the ligament, which furnishes attachment to the\r\ngreater part of the fibers of the muscle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 155.—LEFT STIFLE JOINT OF HORSE, EXTERNAL VIEW, IN PARTIAL\r\n    FLEXION.\r\n\r\n  The capsules have been removed. _18_, Femur; _20_, patella; _21_,\r\n    tibia; _a″_, internal patellar ligament; _b_, external\r\n    femoro-patellar ligament; _d_, external semilunar cartilage. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =synovial membrane= is reflected over the intracapsular parts of\r\nthese ligaments and covers the fossa acetabuli. A pouch also extends\r\nfrom the acetabular notch for a variable distance along the subpubic\r\ngroove above the pubo-femoral ligament.\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—This joint is capable of all the movements of a\r\nball-and-socket joint, viz., flexion, extension, abduction, adduction,\r\nrotation, and circumduction. The greatest range of movement is displayed\r\nin flexion and extension. When standing at rest, the joint is partially\r\nflexed, the articular angle (in front) being about 100° to 115°. The\r\nother movements occur to a very limited extent in normal action.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abduction appears to be checked by tension of the round ligament. The\r\n  pubo-femoral ligament is tensed most promptly by inward rotation of\r\n  the thigh.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE STIFLE JOINT\r\n\r\nThis joint (Articulatio genu), which corresponds to the knee-joint of\r\nman, is the largest and most elaborate of all the articulations. Taken\r\nas a whole, it may be classed as a ginglymus, although it is not a\r\ntypical example of the group. In reality it consists of two joints—the\r\n=femoro-patellar= and the =femoro-tibial=.\r\n\r\nThe =femoro-patellar articulation= (Articulatio femoro-patellaris) is\r\nformed between the trochlea of the femur and the articular surface of\r\nthe patella.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 156.—LEFT STIFLE JOINT OF HORSE, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The capsules are distended and the external patellar ligament is\r\n    removed.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Articular Surfaces.=—The trochlea consists of two slightly oblique\r\nridges, with a wide and deep groove between them. The inner ridge is\r\nmuch the larger of the two, especially at its upper part, which is wide\r\nand rounded. The outer ridge is much narrower, and is more regularly\r\ncurved; its upper part lies about an inch behind a frontal plane tangent\r\nto the inner ridge. The articular surface of the patella is much smaller\r\nthan that of the trochlea. It is completed internally by a supplementary\r\nplate of fibro-cartilage (Fibrocartilago patellæ), which curves over the\r\ninternal surface of the inner lip of the trochlea. A narrow strip of\r\ncartilage is found along the outer border also. The articular cartilage\r\non the trochlea completely covers both surfaces of the inner ridge, but\r\nonly a narrow marginal area on the external surface of the outer ridge.\r\n\r\n=Joint Capsule.=—This is thin and is very capacious. On the patella it\r\nis attached around the margin of the articular surface, but on the femur\r\nthe line of attachment is at a varying distance from the articular\r\nsurface. On the inner side it is an inch or more from the articular\r\ncartilage; on the outer side and above, about half an inch. It pouches\r\nupward under the quadriceps femoris for a distance of two or three\r\ninches, a pad of fat separating the capsule from the muscle. Below the\r\npatella it is separated from the straight ligaments by a thick pad of\r\nfat, but inferiorly it is in contact with the femoro-patellar capsules.\r\nThe joint cavity is the most extensive in the body. It usually\r\ncommunicates with the inner femoro-tibial joint cavity by a slit-like\r\nopening situated at the lowest part of the inner ridge of the trochlea.\r\nA similar, but smaller, communication with the outer femoro-patellar\r\ncapsule is often found at the lowest part of the outer ridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The inner communication appears to be constant in adult horses, but is\r\n  liable to be overlooked on account of the fact that it is covered by a\r\n  valvular fold of the synovial membrane. It is about half an inch wide,\r\n  and lies under the narrow articular area which connects the trochlea\r\n  and internal condyle. The outer communication occurs in 18 to 25 per\r\n  cent. of cases, according to Baum. It is instructive to distend this\r\n  capsule and thus obtain an idea of its potential capacity and\r\n  relations ([Fig. 156]).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 157.—STIFLE JOINT OF HORSE, FRONT VIEW, IN EXTENSION.\r\n\r\n  The capsules are removed. _18_, Femur; _20_, patella; _21_, tibia.\r\n    (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Ligaments.=—The =lateral femoro-patellar ligaments=, external and\r\ninternal (Ligamentum femoro-patellare fibulare, tibiale), are two thin\r\nbands which reinforce the capsule on either side. The external ligament\r\nis fairly distinct; it arises from the external epicondyle of the femur\r\njust above the lateral femoro-tibial ligament, and ends on the external\r\nborder of the patella. The internal ligament is thinner and is not\r\ndistinct from the capsule; it arises above the internal epicondyle, and\r\nends on the patellar fibro-cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =patellar ligaments= (Ligamenta patellæ), also called the straight\r\nligaments of the patella, are three very strong bands which attach the\r\npatella to the tuberosity of the tibia. The =external patellar ligament=\r\nis attached above to the outer part of the anterior surface of the\r\npatella, and below to the outer part of the tuberosity. It receives a\r\nstrong tendon from the biceps femoris muscle. The =middle patellar\r\nligament= extends from the front of the apex of the patella to the lower\r\npart of the groove on the tuberosity of the tibia, a bursa being\r\ninterposed between the ligament and the upper part of the groove. The\r\n=internal patellar ligament= is attached above to the patellar\r\nfibro-cartilage, and ends on the tuberosity of the tibia, internally to\r\nthe groove. It is joined by the common aponeurosis of the gracilis and\r\nsartorius. These so-called ligaments are, in reality, the tendons of\r\ninsertion of the quadriceps femoris muscle, and transmit the action of\r\nthe latter to the tibia; they also function similarly for the other\r\nmuscles attached to them as noted above.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It will be noticed that the upper attachments are further apart than\r\n  the lower ones, so that the ligaments converge below. The inner\r\n  ligament is especially oblique. The middle ligament is more deeply\r\n  placed than the others, and therefore cannot usually be felt\r\n  distinctly in the living animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 158.—SEMILUNAR CARTILAGES AND CRUCIAL LIGAMENTS OF RIGHT STIFLE\r\n    OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _F_, Femoral ligament of external cartilage. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d.\r\n    Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =femoro-tibial articulation= (Articulatio femoro-tibialis) is formed\r\nbetween the condyles of the femur, the proximal end of the tibia, and\r\nthe interposed semilunar cartilages.\r\n\r\n=Articular Surfaces.=—The condyles of the femur are slightly oblique in\r\ndirection. The articular surface of the outer one is more strongly\r\ncurved than that of the inner one; the latter is confluent below with\r\nthe inner ridge of the trochlea, while the narrow ridge which connects\r\nthe external condyle with the trochlea is usually non-articular. The\r\nsaddle-shaped surfaces of the condyles of the tibia are not adapted to\r\nthe femoral condyles, and are in contact with only a small part of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 159.—PROXIMAL ENDS OF RIGHT TIBIA AND FIBULA OF HORSE, WITH\r\n    SEMILUNAR CARTILAGES AND CRUCIAL LIGAMENTS, EXTERNAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =semilunar cartilages= (Meniscus lateralis, medialis) are two\r\nC-shaped or crescentic discs of fibro-cartilage which produce congruence\r\nin the articular surfaces. Each has an upper concave surface adapted to\r\nthe condyle of the femur, and a lower surface which fits the\r\ncorresponding condyle of the tibia. The external cartilage does not\r\ncover the outer and posterior part of the condyle, over which the tendon\r\nof origin of the popliteus muscle plays. The peripheral border is thick\r\nand convex, the central one very thin and concave. The fibrous ends or\r\n=cornua= are attached to the tibia in front of and behind the spine. The\r\nexternal cartilage has a third attachment by means of an oblique band\r\n(Ligamentum femorale menisci lateralis) which passes from the posterior\r\ncornu to the posterior part of the intercondyloid fossa of the femur.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The cornua of the internal cartilage (Ligamenta tibiæ anterius et\r\n  posterius menisci medialis) are attached in front of and behind the\r\n  inner eminence of the spine. The anterior cornu of the external\r\n  cartilage (Ligamentum tibiæ anterius menisci lateralis) is attached in\r\n  front of the outer eminence of the spine. The posterior cornu\r\n  bifurcates; the lower branch (Ligamentum tibiæ posterius menisci\r\n  lateralis) is inserted at the popliteal notch, the upper (Ligamentum\r\n  femorale menisci lateralis) in a small fossa in the extreme posterior\r\n  part of the intercondyloid fossa.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =joint capsule= is attached to the margin of the tibial articular\r\nsurface, but on the femur the line of attachment is for the greater part\r\nabout half an inch from the articular margin. It is also attached to the\r\nconvex borders of the semilunar cartilages and to the crucial ligaments.\r\nIt is strong posteriorly, but in front it practically consists only of\r\nthe synovial layer. There are two synovial sacs, corresponding to the\r\ndouble nature of the articular surfaces; they do not usually\r\ncommunicate, and each is partially divided into an upper and a lower\r\ncompartment by the semilunar cartilage. The inner sac pouches upward\r\nabout half an inch over the condyle of the femur. The external sac\r\ninvests the tendon of origin of the popliteus muscle, and also pouches\r\ndownward about three or four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) beneath the\r\nperoneus tertius and long extensor muscles (Fig. 156). As stated above,\r\nthe outer sac sometimes communicates with the femoro-patellar joint\r\ncavity, and the inner sac usually, if not always, does so in the adult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 160.—LEFT STIFLE JOINT OF HORSE, INTERNAL VIEW IN EXTREME\r\n    EXTENSION.[38]\r\n\r\n  _18_, Femur; _20_, patella (base); _21_, tibia; _d_, internal\r\n    semilunar cartilage. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Ligaments.=—There are four of these—two lateral and two crucial.\r\n\r\nThe =internal lateral ligament= (Ligamentum collaterale tibiale) is\r\nattached above to the prominent internal epicondyle of the femur, and\r\nbelow to a rough area below the margin of the internal condyle of the\r\ntibia.\r\n\r\nThe =external lateral ligament= (Ligamentum collaterale fibulare) is\r\nsomewhat thicker; it arises from the upper depression on the external\r\nepicondyle, and ends on the head of the fibula. It covers the tendon of\r\nthe origin of the popliteus muscle, and a bursa is interposed between\r\nthe lower part of the ligament and the margin of the external condyle of\r\nthe tibia.\r\n\r\nThe =crucial ligaments= are two strong rounded bands situated mainly in\r\nthe intercondyloid fossa of the femur, between the two synovial sacs.\r\nThey cross each other somewhat in the form of an X, and are named\r\naccording to their tibial attachments. The =anterior crucial ligament=\r\n(Ligamentum cruciatum anterius) arises in the central fossa on the\r\ntibial spine, extends upward and backward, and ends on the upper part of\r\nthe inner surface of the external condyle of the femur. The =posterior\r\ncrucial ligament= (Ligamentum cruciatum posterius) is internal to the\r\npreceding, and is somewhat larger. It is attached to an eminence at the\r\npopliteal notch of the tibia, is directed upward and forward, and ends\r\nin the anterior part of the intercondyloid fossa of the femur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 161.—RIGHT STIFLE JOINT OF HORSE; SAGITTAL SECTION PASSING\r\n    THROUGH OUTER PART OF INNER RIDGE OF TROCHLEA AND INTERCONDYLOID\r\n    FOSSA.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Anterior crucial ligament; _2_, posterior crucial ligament; _3_,\r\n    posterior cornu of internal semilunar cartilage; _4_, femoral\r\n    ligament of external semilunar cartilage; _5_, articular artery;\r\n    _6_, part of vastus internus.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  It may be added that these ligaments do not lie in a sagittal plane,\r\n  but are somewhat twisted across each other; outward rotation of the\r\n  leg untwists and slackens them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—The principal movements of the stifle joint as a whole are\r\nflexion and extension. In the ordinary standing position the articular\r\nangle (behind) is about 140° to 150°. Flexion is limited only by contact\r\nof the leg with the thigh if the hock is also flexed. Extension is\r\nincomplete, _i. e._, the femur and tibia cannot be brought into the same\r\nstraight line. Rotation is limited, and is freest during semiflexion.\r\nThe patella glides on the femoral trochlea upward in extension, downward\r\nin flexion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Extension is checked mainly by tension of the crucial and lateral\r\n  ligaments. In extreme extension, which is accompanied by slight\r\n  outward rotation of the leg, the patella can be pushed upward and\r\n  inward so that its fibro-cartilage hooks over the upper end of the\r\n  inner ridge of the trochlea, but it will not remain there unless held\r\n  in position. When pressure is removed, the base of the patella tips\r\n  forward and the cartilage lies upon the most prominent part of the\r\n  trochlear ridge. During flexion, which is accompanied by slight inward\r\n  rotation of the leg, the condyles of the femur and the semilunar\r\n  cartilages glide backward on the tibia; the movement of the external\r\n  condyle and cartilage is greater than that of the inner one. In\r\n  extreme flexion the patellar and posterior crucial ligaments are\r\n  tense; the other ligaments are relaxed. The movement of the patella is\r\n  gliding with coaptation, _i. e._, different parts of the opposing\r\n  articular surfaces come into contact successively. Only a narrow\r\n  transverse strip (ca. 1.5 to 2 cm. wide) of the patella is in contact\r\n  with the trochlea at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TIBIO-FIBULAR ARTICULATION\r\n\r\nThe head of the fibula articulates with a crescentic facet just below\r\nthe outer margin of the external condyle of the tibia. The =joint\r\ncapsule= is strong and close. The shaft of the fibula is attached to the\r\nexternal border of the tibia by the =interosseous membrane= of the leg\r\n(Membrana interossea cruris); this is perforated about an inch from its\r\nproximal end by an opening which transmits the anterior tibial vessels\r\nto the front of the tibia. A fibrous cord usually extends from the\r\ndistal end of the shaft of the fibula to the external malleolus. The\r\nlatter is the distal end of the fibula which has fused with the tibia.\r\nNo appreciable movement occurs in this joint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 162.—LEFT HOCK JOINT OF HORSE, EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 163.—LEFT HOCK JOINT OF HORSE, INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _21_, Tibia; _24_, tuber calcis; _25_, large metatarsal bone; _47_,\r\n    long external lateral ligament; _51_, long internal lateral\r\n    ligament. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE HOCK JOINT\r\n\r\nThis is a composite joint made up of a number of articulations\r\n(Articulationes tarsi). These are: (1) The tibio-tarsal articulation;\r\n(2) the intertarsal articulations; (3) the tarso-metatarsal\r\narticulation.\r\n\r\nThe =tibio-tarsal articulation= (Articulatio talo-cruralis) is a typical\r\nginglymus formed by the trochlea of the tibial tarsal bone (astragalus\r\nor talus) and the corresponding surface of the distal end of the tibia.\r\nThe ridges and grooves of these surfaces are directed obliquely forward\r\nand outward at an angle of about 12° to 15°, with a sagittal plane. The\r\ntrochlear surface is about twice as extensive as that on the tibia, and\r\nits ridges have a spiral curvature. The other articulations are\r\narthrodia, which have joint surfaces and ligaments of such a nature as\r\nto allow only a minimal amount of gliding motion.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the carpal joints, it is convenient to describe first\r\nthe common capsule and ligaments, which are the more important\r\npractically, and then to consider very briefly the special ligaments.\r\n\r\nThe fibrous part of the =joint capsule= is attached around the margin of\r\nthe tibial articular surface above and the metatarsal surfaces below; it\r\nis also attached in part to the free surface of the bones which it\r\ncovers, and blends with the lateral ligaments. Its anterior part\r\n(anterior ligament) is rather thin; in distention of the capsule, as in\r\n“bog-spavin,” its antero-internal part, which is not bound down by the\r\ntendons passing over the joint, forms a fluctuating swelling over the\r\ninner ridge of the trochlea. The posterior part (posterior and\r\ntarso-metatarsal ligaments) is very thick, and is intimately attached to\r\nthe tarsal bones. Its superficial face is in part cartilaginous, and\r\nforms a smooth surface for the perforans tendon. Superiorly, it pouches\r\nupward behind the distal end of the tibia for a distance of about two\r\ninches (ca. 5 cm.). Interiorly, it is continued downward, forming the\r\n=subtarsal= or =check ligament=, which unites with the perforans tendon\r\nabout the middle of the metatarsus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 164.—LEFT HOCK JOINT OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _21_, Tibia; _22_, trochlea of tibial tarsal bone; _25_, large\r\n    metatarsal bone; _50_, dorsal or oblique ligament. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are four =synovial sacs=: 1. The =tibio-tarsal sac= lubricates the\r\nproximal joint, and is much the largest and most important. It is\r\nchiefly involved in the swelling produced by excess of fluid in the\r\njoint cavity, when the capsule bulges antero-internally and\r\npostero-superiorly. 2. The =first intertarsal sac= lines the joints\r\nformed by the tibial and fibular tarsal bones above, and the central and\r\nfourth tarsals below; it communicates in front with the proximal\r\nsynovial capsule. 3. The =second intertarsal sac= lubricates the joints\r\nformed between the central tarsal and the bones below and on either\r\nside. 4. The =tarso-metatarsal sac= lubricates the joints formed between\r\nthe tarsal and metatarsal bones, those between the proximal ends of the\r\nmetatarsal bones, and those formed by the third tarsal with the bones on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\n=Common Ligaments.=—The =external lateral ligament= (Ligamentum\r\ncollaterale fibulare longum et breve) consists of two distinct bands\r\nwhich cross each other. The =long= (superficial) =ligament= arises on\r\nthe posterior part of the external malleolus, is directed almost\r\nstraight downward, and is attached to the fibular and fourth tarsal\r\nbones and the large and external small metatarsal bones. It forms a\r\ncanal for the lateral extensor tendon. The =short= (deep) =ligament=\r\narises on the anterior part of the external malleolus, is directed\r\nchiefly backward, and ends on the rough excavation on the external\r\nsurface of the tibial tarsal and the adjacent surface of the fibular\r\ntarsal bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 165.—LEFT HOCK JOINT OF HORSE, POSTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _21_, Tibia; _24_, tuber calcis. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für\r\n    Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =internal lateral ligament= (Ligamentum collaterale tibiale longum\r\net breve) also consists of two parts which cross each other. The =long\r\nligament= arises on the posterior part of the internal malleolus,\r\nbecomes wider below, and is attached on the lower tuberosity of the\r\ntibial tarsal, the large and outer small metatarsal bones, and the inner\r\nsurface of the lower tarsal bones which it covers. The =short ligament=\r\nlies largely under cover of the long one. It extends from the anterior\r\npart of the internal malleolus, runs backward and somewhat downward, and\r\ndivides into two branches; one of these ends on the upper tuberosity on\r\nthe inner surface of the tibial tarsal bone, the other on the\r\nsustentaculum tali.\r\n\r\nThe =plantar= or =calcaneo-metatarsal ligament= (Ligamentum tarsi\r\nplantare) is a very strong flat band which covers the outer part of the\r\nposterior surface of the tarsus. It is attached to the posterior surface\r\nof the fibular and fourth tarsal bones and the proximal end of the\r\nexternal metatarsal bone.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal= or =oblique ligament= (Ligamentum tarsi dorsale) is a\r\ntriangular sheet which is attached above to the lower tuberosity on the\r\ninner face of the tibial tarsal bone, and spreads out below on the\r\ncentral and third tarsal bones, and the proximal ends of the large and\r\ninner small metatarsal bones, to all of which it is attached.\r\n\r\n=Special Ligaments.=—A considerable number of short bands which connect\r\nadjacent bones of the tarsus and metatarsus are described by various\r\nauthors; some of these are quite distinct; others are difficult to\r\nisolate. Most of them are not of sufficient importance to justify\r\ndetailed description.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) The =tibial= and =fibular tarsal= bones are united by four bands\r\n  (astragalo-calcaneal ligaments). The =internal ligament= extends from\r\n  the sustentaculum tali to the adjacent part of the tibia tarsal,\r\n  blending with the short lateral ligament. The =external ligament=\r\n  extends from the anterior process of the fibular tarsal to the\r\n  adjacent part of the external ridge of the trochlea. The =superior\r\n  ligament= extends from the posterior margin of the trochlea to the\r\n  fibular tarsal. The =interosseous ligament= is deeply placed in the\r\n  sinus tarsi between the two bones, and is attached in the rough areas\r\n  of the opposed surfaces.\r\n\r\n  (2) The smaller bones are attached to each other as follows: The\r\n  central and third tarsal are united by an interosseous and an oblique\r\n  anterior ligament (scaphoido-cunean ligaments). The central and fourth\r\n  tarsal are united by an interosseous and a transverse external\r\n  ligament (cuboido-scaphoid ligament). The third and fourth tarsals are\r\n  similarly connected (cuboido-cunean ligaments). The third tarsal is\r\n  joined by an interosseous (intercunean) ligament to the (fused) first\r\n  and second tarsals; the latter are connected with the fourth tarsal by\r\n  a transverse posterior ligament.\r\n\r\n  (3) The smaller bones are connected with the upper row as follows: The\r\n  central is attached to the tibial tarsal by posterior and interosseous\r\n  (astragalo-seaphoid) ligaments, and to the fibular tarsal by a short\r\n  oblique (calcaneo-scaphoid) band. The fourth is attached to the\r\n  fibular tarsal by interosseous and posterior (calcaneo-cuboid)\r\n  ligaments. The (fused) first and second tarsals are connected with the\r\n  fibular tarsal by a posterior (calcaneo-cunean) ligament.\r\n\r\n  (4) The lower tarsal bones are connected with the metatarsus by\r\n  tarso-metatarsal ligaments, which are not distinct from the common\r\n  ligaments, except in the case of the interosseous ligament between the\r\n  third tarsal and metatarsal bones.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 166.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF HOCK OF HORSE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Movements.=—These are flexion and extension, which take place at the\r\ntibio-tarsal joint. The movements between the tarsal bones, and between\r\nthe latter and the metatarsus, are so limited as to be negligible so far\r\nas the action of the joint as a whole is concerned. In the standing\r\nposition the articular angle (in front) is about 150° to 160°. Complete\r\nextension is prevented by tension of the lateral ligaments. Flexion is\r\nchecked only by contact of the metatarsus with the leg, provided the\r\nstifle joint is also flexed. Owing to the fact that the axis of motion\r\nis slightly oblique, the lower part of the limb deviates somewhat\r\noutward during flexion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The movements of the hock joint must correspond with those of the\r\n  stifle on account of the tendinous bands in front and behind (peroneus\r\n  tertius and flexor perforatus), which extend from the lower part of\r\n  the femur to the tarsus and metatarsus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining joints differ in no material respect from those of the\r\nthoracic limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       COMPARATIVE ARTHROLOGY[39]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  JOINTS AND LIGAMENTS OF THE VERTEBRÆ\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—The ligamentum nuchæ is better developed than in the horse. The\r\nfunicular part is clearly divided into two lateral halves, which are\r\nround at their occipital attachment, but from the axis backward become\r\nrapidly wider and flat. This wide portion is almost sagittal, lies on\r\neither side of the vertebral spines, and is covered by the trapezius and\r\nrhomboideus muscles. From the highest part of the withers (third\r\nthoracic spine) it gradually diminishes in size and fades out in the\r\nlumbar region. The lamellar part is thick, and consists of anterior and\r\nposterior parts. The anterior part is double; its fibers proceed from\r\nthe funicular part to the second, third, and fourth cervical spines. The\r\nposterior part is single; its fibers extend from the first thoracic\r\nspine to the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical spines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 167.—LIGAMENTUM NUCHÆ OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Funicular part; _b_, wide portion; _c_, _d_, lamellar part; _e_,\r\n    interspinous ligaments; _1_, spinous process of first thoracic\r\n    vertebra; _2_, axis. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe inferior common ligament is very strong in the lumbar region.\r\n\r\nThe intervertebral fibro-cartilages are thicker than in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe interspinous ligaments of the back and loins consist largely of\r\nelastic tissue.\r\n\r\nThere are no intertransverse joints in the lumbar region.\r\n\r\n=Pig.=—The ligamentum nuchæ is represented by a fibrous raphé and thin\r\nlayers of elastic tissue which extend between the cervical spines.\r\n\r\nThe atlanto-occipital and atlanto-axial joints resemble those of the\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nThe interspinous ligaments of the neck are elastic.\r\n\r\n=Dog.=—The ligamentum nuchæ consists of a small fibrous band which\r\nextends from the spine of the axis to the anterior thoracic spines; it\r\nmay be regarded as a mere fibrous raphé between the right and left\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nThere are interspinous muscles instead of ligaments in the neck.\r\n\r\nThere are three ligaments in connection with the odontoid process. The\r\ntwo alar ligaments (Ligamenta alaria) arise on either side of the\r\nodontoid process, diverge, and end on either side of the foramen magnum.\r\nThe transverse ligament of the atlas (Ligamentum transversum atlantis)\r\nstretches across the dorsal surface of the odontoid process and binds it\r\ndown on the ventral arch of the atlas, a bursa being interposed. It is\r\nattached on either side to the lateral masses of the atlas.\r\n\r\nThe two capsules of the atlanto-occipital joint communicate with each\r\nother, and usually with the capsule of the atlanto-axial joint also.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ARTICULATIONS OF THE THORAX\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—The second to the eleventh costo-chondral joints inclusive are\r\ndiarthroses with close capsules, reinforced externally. (They are\r\nsynchondroses in the sheep.) The upper parts of the cartilages are\r\nattached to each other by distinct elastic ligaments (Ligamenta\r\nintercostalia).\r\n\r\nThe first pair of chondro-sternal joints are separate from each other;\r\nintercrossing fibers unite the costo-chondral junctions above the\r\njoints.\r\n\r\nThe first segment of the sternum forms a diarthrosis with the body. The\r\nanterior joint surface is concave, the posterior convex. The joint\r\n(Articulatio intersternalis) is surrounded by a close capsule, and the\r\njoint surfaces are attached to each by a small intraarticular ligament.\r\nLimited lateral movement is possible. (In the sheep the joint is a\r\nsynchondrosis.)\r\n\r\nBoth surfaces of the sternum are covered by a layer of fibrous tissue.\r\n\r\n=Pig.=—The second to the fifth or sixth costo-chondral joints are\r\ndiarthroses. The intersternal articulation and the sternal ligaments\r\nresemble those of the ox.\r\n\r\n=Dog.=—The first chondro-sternal joints do not coalesce.\r\n\r\nThe internal sternal ligament divides into three bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TEMPORO-MANDIBULAR ARTICULATION\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—The articular surfaces are of such a character as to permit more\r\nextensive lateral movement than in the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The condyle of the mandible is relatively small and is concave\r\n  transversely. The temporal articular surface is extensive and is\r\n  convex in both directions. The postglenoid process is small.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pig.=—The considerable longitudinal diameter of the temporal articular\r\nsurfaces and the very small size of the postglenoid process allow great\r\nfreedom of protraction and retraction of the lower jaw. Lateral movement\r\nis limited. The posterior ligament is absent.\r\n\r\n=Dog.=—The articular surfaces allow extremely little lateral or gliding\r\nmovement. They are cylindrical in curvature, and the interarticular disc\r\nis very thin. The posterior ligament is absent.\r\n\r\nThe other articulations of the skull are sufficiently described in the\r\nOsteology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   Articulations of the Thoracic Limb\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SHOULDER JOINT\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—The articular angle is about 100°.\r\n\r\n=Pig and Dog.=—The joint capsule communicates freely with the bicipital\r\nbursa. There is a rudimentary marginal cartilage around the rim of the\r\nglenoid cavity. In the dog there is usually a strong band extending from\r\nthe acromion to the outer part of the capsule; another band (Ligamentum\r\ncoraco-acromiale) often stretches between the scapular tuberosity and\r\nthe acromion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ELBOW JOINT\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—No important differences exist. The upper part of the interosseous\r\nradio-ulnar ligament is commonly ossified in the adult.\r\n\r\n=Pig.=—There are no important differences. The radius and ulna are so\r\nfirmly united by the interosseous ligament as to prevent any appreciable\r\nmovement between them.\r\n\r\n=Dog.=—The joint capsule is reinforced in front by an oblique ligament\r\nwhich arises on the front of the external condyle of the humerus above\r\nthe joint surface, and joins the terminal part of the biceps and\r\nbrachialis below. The external lateral ligament is thick and divides\r\ninto two parts; the anterior part is attached to the radius and blends\r\nwith the annular ligament; the posterior part widens below, forming a\r\nsort of cap, and is attached to the ulna. The internal lateral ligament\r\nalso divides into two branches; the anterior branch ends on the inner\r\nsurface of the neck of the radius; the posterior enters the interosseous\r\nspace and is attached to both bones. An elastic band (Ligamentum\r\nolecrani) extends from the outer surface of the internal epicondyle to\r\nthe anterior border of the ulna.\r\n\r\nThere are two radio-ulnar joints. The proximal radio-ulnar joint is\r\nincluded in the capsule of the elbow, but is provided with an annular\r\nligament which extends from the lower part of the external ligament\r\nacross the front of the proximal end of the radius to the ulna, blending\r\nwith the biceps and brachialis tendons. The distal joint is formed by a\r\nconcave facet on the radius and a convex one on the radius, and is\r\nsurrounded by a tight capsule. The interosseous membrane unites the\r\nshafts of the two bones. The movements consist of limited rotation of\r\nthe radius (ca. 20°), carrying the paw with it. The ordinary position is\r\ntermed pronation; outward rotation is supination.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CARPAL JOINTS\r\n\r\nThese have the same general arrangement as in the horse. Numerous minor\r\ndifferences naturally exist, but must be excluded from this brief\r\naccount, which contains only important special features.\r\n\r\nThe lateral movements are freer, especially in the dog, but flexion is\r\nnot so complete: the anatomical explanation of these facts lies in the\r\nnature of the articular surfaces and certain ligamentous differences.\r\nThe lateral ligaments are much weaker, the long external one being\r\nespecially small in the ox. Two oblique, somewhat elastic, bands cross\r\nthe front of the radio-carpal and intercarpal joints. The proximal one\r\nis attached to the distal end of the radius and passes downward and\r\noutward to the ulnar carpal bone; the other one connects the radial and\r\nfourth carpal bones in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nIn the ox the short lateral ligaments are well defined, a ligament\r\nconnects the accessory carpal with the distal end of the ulna, and\r\nstrong bands connect the distal bones with the metacarpus.\r\n\r\nThe interosseous and interordinal ligaments vary with the number of\r\ncarpal bones present in the different species.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         INTERMETACARPAL JOINTS\r\n\r\nIn the ox the small (fifth) metacarpal bone articulates with the large\r\nmetacarpal, but not with the carpus. The joint cavity is connected with\r\nthat of the carpo-metacarpal sac. The proximal end of the small\r\nmetacarpal bone is attached by a ligament to the fourth carpal, and\r\nanother band extends from its distal part to the side of the large\r\nmetacarpal. There is also an interosseous ligament, which is permanent\r\nand allows a small amount of movement.\r\n\r\nThe chief metacarpal bones of the pig, and the second to the fifth of\r\nthe dog, articulate with each other at their proximal ends, and are\r\nconnected by interosseous ligaments, which do not, however, unite them\r\nclosely, as in the horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 168.—DISTAL PART OF LIMB OF OX, SHOWING LIGAMENTS AND TENDONS.\r\n    ONE DIGIT AND CORRESPONDING ARTICULAR PART OF METACARPAL BONE ARE\r\n    REMOVED.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Suspensory ligament; _a′_, branch of _a_ to superficial flexor\r\n    tendon; _a″_, _a‴_, lateral and central branches of _a_; _b_, deep\r\n    flexor tendon; _b′_, branch of _b_ to digit removed; _c_, _c′_,\r\n    superficial flexor tendon; _d_, _d′_, intersesamoid ligament (cut);\r\n    _e_, interdigital lateral ligament of fetlock joint; _f_, tendon of\r\n    common extensor; _g_, proximal interdigital ligament; _h_, digital\r\n    annular ligament; _i_, posterior annular ligament of fetlock; _k_,\r\n    lateral ligament of pastern joint; _l_, distal interdigital\r\n    ligament; _m_, crucial interdigital ligament (cut); _m′_, _m″_,\r\n    attachments of _m_ to second phalanx and distal sesamoid bone; _n_,\r\n    suspensory ligament of distal sesamoid; _o_, anterior elastic\r\n    ligament; _p_, lateral volar ligament of pastern joint; _1_,\r\n    metacarpus, sawn off at _1′_; _2_, first phalanx; _3_, second\r\n    phalanx; _4_, third phalanx. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nMETACARPO-PHALANGEAL JOINTS\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—There are two joints, one for each digit. The two capsules\r\ncommunicate posteriorly. The two interdigital lateral ligaments\r\n(Ligamenta collateralia interdigitalia) result from the bifurcation of a\r\nband which arises in the furrow between the divisions of the distal end\r\nof the large metacarpal bone; they spread out and end on the proximal\r\nends of the first phalanges. A strong =superior interdigital ligament=\r\n(Ligamentum interdigitale), consisting of short intercrossing fibers,\r\nunites the middles of the interdigital surfaces of the first phalanges.\r\n\r\nCrucial ligaments (Ligamenta phalango-sesamoideæ) connect the sesamoids\r\nwith the proximal end of the opposite first phalanx.\r\n\r\nThe intersesamoid ligament connects all four sesamoids, and extends\r\nupward much less than in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe lateral sesamoidean ligaments end almost entirely on the first\r\nphalanges.\r\n\r\nThe superficial inferior sesamoidean ligament is absent. The middle\r\ninferior sesamoidean ligaments of each digit are two short strong bands\r\nwhich extend from the distal margins of the sesamoids to the proximal\r\nends of the first phalanges. The deep inferior sesamoidean ligaments are\r\nstrong and distinctly crucial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 169.—LIGAMENTS AND TENDONS OF DIGITS OF PIG, VOLAR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Superficial flexor tendon; _b_, deep flexor tendon; _b′_,\r\n    branches of _b_ to accessory digits; _c_, _c′_, annular ligaments;\r\n    _d-d‴_, ligaments of accessory digits; _e_, cruciate interdigital\r\n    ligaments; _f_, _f′_, spiral band around the flexor tendons of the\r\n    accessory digits; _g_, abductor of accessory digit.\r\n    (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d.

Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe suspensory or superior sesamoidean ligament is more distinctly\r\nmuscular than in the horse—indeed in the young animal it consists almost\r\nentirely of muscular tissue. At the distal third of the metacarpus it\r\ndivides into three branches. These give rise to five subdivisions,\r\neither by bifurcation of the lateral branches or trifurcation of the\r\nmiddle branch. The four lateral bands end on the sesamoid bones and the\r\ndistal end of the large metacarpal bone, and detach slips to the\r\nextensor tendons. The middle band passes through the groove between the\r\ntwo divisions of the distal end of the metacarpus, and divides into two\r\nbranches which join the tendons of the proper extensors of the digits;\r\nit sends fibers also to the interdigital lateral ligaments and to the\r\ncentral sesamoids. About the middle of the metacarpus the suspensory\r\nligament detaches a band which unites lower down with the superficial\r\nflexor tendon, thus inclosing the tendon of the deep flexor of the\r\ndigit; it also blends with the thick fascia of the region. The latter\r\ngives off a band on either side to the accessory digits, and a tendinous\r\nband descends from each accessory digit to the third phalanx and\r\nsesamoid bone, blending with the tendon of the corresponding proper\r\nextensor.\r\n\r\n=Pig.=—There are four metacarpo-phalangeal joints, each of which has a\r\ncapsule, lateral, intersesamoidean, and crucial sesamoidean ligaments.\r\nSince distinct interosseous muscles are present, there are, of course,\r\nno suspensory ligaments.\r\n\r\n=Dog.=—There are five metacarpo-phalangeal joints, each having its own\r\ncapsule and indistinct lateral ligaments. A small sesamoid bone occurs\r\nin the anterior part of each capsule, over which the corresponding\r\nextensor tendon plays. The intersesamoidean ligaments do not extend\r\nabove the sesamoids. The cruciate ligaments are present, as well as a\r\nfibrous layer which attaches the distal margins of the sesamoids to the\r\nposterior surface of the proximal end of the first phalanx.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         INTERPHALANGEAL JOINTS\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—The two proximal joints have separate capsules, and broad, but\r\nrather indistinct, lateral ligaments. Each joint has also two central\r\nand two lateral volar ligaments. The central ligaments are largely fused\r\nto form a strong band. The lateral ones extend from the borders of the\r\nfirst phalanx to the proximal end of the second phalanx.\r\n\r\nThe distal interphalangeal joints have, in addition to the capsules and\r\nlateral ligaments, bands which reinforce them on either side. The\r\ncentral or interdigital pair arise in the depressions on the distal ends\r\nof the first phalanges, receive fibers from the second phalanges, and\r\nend on the interdigital surfaces of the third phalanges at the margin of\r\nthe articular surface. The lateral pair have a similar course, but are\r\nthinner, and end on the corresponding third sesamoid. An elastic band\r\ncrosses the front of the second phalanx obliquely, from the distal end\r\nof the first phalanx to the extensor process of the third phalanx.\r\n\r\nThe =crucial= or =inferior interdigital ligaments= (Ligamenta cruciata\r\ninterdigitalia) are two strong bands which limit the separation of the\r\ndigits. They are attached above to the lateral (or abaxial) eminences on\r\nthe proximal ends of the second phalanges (blending with the lateral\r\nligaments), cross the deep flexor tendon obliquely, and reach the\r\ninterdigital space, where they intercross and blend. Most of the fibers\r\nend on the third sesamoid of the opposite side, but some are attached to\r\nthe interdigital aspect of the second phalanx and the third sesamoid of\r\nthe same side. In the sheep there is, instead of the foregoing, a\r\ntransverse ligament which is attached on either side to the interdigital\r\nsurfaces of the second and third phalanges and the third sesamoid bone.\r\nIt is related below to the skin, above to a pad of fat.\r\n\r\n=Pig.=—The interphalangeal joints of the chief digits resemble in\r\ngeneral those of the ox. The inferior interdigital ligament resembles,\r\nhowever, that of the sheep, and is intimately adherent to the skin.\r\nThere is, besides, a remarkable arrangement of ligaments which connect\r\nthe small digits with each other and with the chief digits.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This apparatus is somewhat complex, but its chief features are as\r\n  follows: A superior interdigital ligament is attached on either side\r\n  to the third phalanges of the small digits, while centrally it blends\r\n  with the annular ligaments of the flexor tendons behind the\r\n  metacarpo-phalangeal joints of the chief digits. Two bands (central\r\n  longitudinal interdigital ligaments) arise on the bases of the small\r\n  digits, cross the flexor tendons obliquely downward and inward, pass\r\n  through the superior interdigital ligament, and blend below with the\r\n  inferior interdigital ligament. Two lateral bands (lateral\r\n  longitudinal interdigital ligaments) are attached in common with the\r\n  superior interdigital ligaments to the third phalanges of the small\r\n  digits, and blend below with the outer part of the inferior\r\n  interdigital ligament.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dog.=—Each joint has a capsule and two lateral ligaments. The distal\r\njoints have also two elastic =dorsal ligaments= (Ligamenta dorsalia),\r\nwhich extend from the proximal end of the second phalanx to the ridge at\r\nthe base of the third phalanx (Fig. 133). They produce dorsal flexion of\r\nthe joint, and thus raise or retract the claws when the flexor muscles\r\nrelax. The distal sesamoids are represented by complementary cartilages\r\nattached to the volar margins of the articular surfaces of the third\r\nphalanges.\r\n\r\nThree interdigital ligaments restrict the spreading apart of the digits.\r\nTwo of these cross the volar surface of the proximal parts of the chief\r\ndigits, _i. e._, one for the second and third, the other for the fourth\r\nand fifth; they blend with the annular ligaments on either side. The\r\nthird ligament is attached on either side to the foregoing ligaments and\r\nthe annular ligaments of the third and fourth digits, and curves\r\ndownward centrally, ending in the large pad on the paw.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ARTICULATIONS OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SACRO-ILIAC JOINT\r\n\r\nThis joint and the pelvic ligaments present no very striking differences\r\nin the other animals. The sacro-sciatic ligament in the dog is a narrow\r\nbut strong band which extends from the posterior part of the lateral\r\nmargin of the sacrum to the tuber ischii; it is the homologue of the\r\nligamentum sacro-tuberosum of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HIP JOINT\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—The shallowness of the acetabulum is compensated by the greater\r\nsize of the marginal cartilage. The head of the femur has a smaller\r\nradius of curvature than that of the horse, and the articular surface\r\nextends a considerable distance outward on the upper surface of the\r\nneck. The round ligament is entirely intraarticular; it is small, and\r\nsometimes absent. The pubo-femoral or accessory ligament is absent.\r\n\r\nThere are no important differences in the other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              STIFLE JOINT\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—There is a considerable communication between the femoro-patellar\r\nand inner femoro-tibial joint cavities; this is situated as in the\r\nhorse, but is wider. A small communication with the external\r\nfemoro-tibial capsule sometimes occurs. The two femoro-tibial capsules\r\nusually communicate. The middle patellar ligament is not sunken, as\r\nthere is no groove on the tuberosity of the tibia where it is attached.\r\nThe external patellar ligament fuses completely with the tendon of\r\ninsertion of the biceps femoris, and a synovial bursa is interposed\r\nbetween them and the external condyle of the femur.\r\n\r\nIn the other animals there is a single ligamentum patellæ, and the\r\nsynovial sacs communicate so freely as to constitute a common joint\r\ncavity. In the dog the semilunar cartilages are united anteriorly by a\r\ntransverse ligament, and the posterior part of the capsule contains the\r\ntwo Vesalian sesamoids, which articulate with the condyles of the femur.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TIBIO-FIBULAR JOINTS\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—The proximal end of the fibula fuses with the external condyle of\r\nthe tibia. The distal end remains separate, and forms an arthrosis with\r\nthe distal end of the tibia; the movement here is imperceptible, as the\r\ntwo bones are closely united by strong peripheral fibers.\r\n\r\n=Pig.=—The superior joint is provided with a capsule which is reinforced\r\nin front and behind by fibrous tissue.\r\n\r\nThe interosseous ligament attaches the shaft of the fibula to the outer\r\nborder of the tibia.\r\n\r\nThe inferior joint is included in the capsule of the hock joint, and is\r\nstrengthened by oblique anterior and posterior ligaments. There is also\r\nan interosseus ligament.\r\n\r\n=Dog.=—The arrangement is essentially the same as in the pig, but there\r\nis no interosseous ligament in the inferior joint.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HOCK JOINT\r\n\r\n=Ox.=—There is very considerable mobility at the first intertarsal\r\njoint, the capsule of which is correspondingly roomy. The short external\r\nlateral ligament is attached below on the tibial tarsal only. A strong\r\ntransverse ligament attaches the external malleolus (distal end of the\r\nfibula) to the back of the tibial tarsal bone. The dorsal or oblique\r\nligament is narrow and thin.\r\n\r\n=Pig.=—The arrangement in general resembles that of the ox.\r\n\r\n=Dog.=—The long lateral ligaments are very small, and the short ones\r\ndouble. The plantar ligament is weak, and ends on the fourth metacarpal\r\nbone. No distinct dorsal (or oblique) ligament is present. Movement\r\noccurs almost exclusively at the tibio-tarsal joint.\r\n\r\nThe remaining joints resemble those of the thoracic limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\n                                MYOLOGY\r\n\r\nThe =muscles= (Musculi) are the active organs of motion. They are\r\ncharacterized by their property of contracting when stimulated. Muscular\r\ntissue is of three kinds: (_a_) =Striated= or striped; (_b_)\r\n=non-striated=, unstriped, or smooth; and (_c_) =cardiac=. Only the\r\nfirst of these varieties will be considered in this section. The striped\r\nmuscles, being for the most part directly or indirectly connected with\r\nthe skeleton, are often termed =skeletal= or somatic, while unstriped\r\nmuscle may be spoken of as =visceral= or splanchnic. The former cover\r\nthe greater part of the skeleton, and thus in a large measure determine\r\nthe form of the animal. They are red in color, the shade varying in\r\ndifferent muscles and under various conditions.\r\n\r\nMuscles vary greatly in =form=, and may be classified as—(_a_) =Long=;\r\n(_b_) =short=; (_c_) =flat=; (_d_) =ring-like= or =orbicular=. Long\r\nmuscles are found chiefly in the limbs, while the flat or broad muscles\r\noccur principally in the trunk, where they assist in forming the walls\r\nof the body cavities. The ring-like or orbicular muscles circumscribe\r\norifices which they close, and are hence termed =sphincters=.\r\n\r\n=Attachments.=—The muscles are attached to =bones=, =cartilages=,\r\n=ligaments=, =fasciæ=, or the =skin=. In all cases the attachment is by\r\nmeans of fibrous tissue, the muscle-fibers not coming into direct\r\nrelation with the bone or cartilage. The perimysium of the muscle may\r\nfuse directly with the periosteum or perichondrium (fleshy attachment),\r\nor the union may be by means of intermediary fibrous structures called\r\n=tendons= or =aponeuroses= (tendinous attachment). Tendons may be\r\nfunicular, ribbon-like, or in the form of membranous sheets; to the\r\nlatter the term aponeurosis is commonly applied.\r\n\r\nIn certain positions, especially where tendons play over joints or are\r\nsubjected to great pressure, =sesamoid bones= develop in the original\r\ntendon tissue. Some of these are large and constant, as the patella and\r\nthe great sesamoids of the fetlock.\r\n\r\nThe accessory structures connected with the muscles are the =synovial\r\nmembranes= and the =fasciæ=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 171.—DIAGRAMS OF CROSS-SECTIONS OF TENDON SHEATH (A) AND BURSA\r\n    (B); T, TENDON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =synovial membranes= are arranged in two principal forms: (_a_)\r\n=Bursal=; (_b_) =vaginal=. A =bursa= (Bursa mucosa) is a simple sac\r\ninterposed between the tendon or muscle and some deeper seated\r\nstructure—most commonly a bony prominence. A =vagina tendinis= or\r\n=tendon sheath= differs from a bursa in the fact that the synovial sac\r\nis folded around the tendon more or less completely, so that two layers\r\ncan be distinguished; of these, the inner one adheres closely to the\r\ntendon, while the outer lines the groove or canal in which the tendon\r\nlies. The two layers are continuous along a fold termed the\r\n=mesotendon=. The arrangement is shown in Fig. 171.[41] The articular\r\nsynovial membranes in some places form extra-articular pouches, which\r\nfacilitate the play of tendons.\r\n\r\nThe =fasciæ= are sheets of connective tissue, mainly of the white\r\nfibrous variety, with a greater or less admixture of elastic fibers in\r\ncertain cases. Two layers may usually be recognized. Of these, the\r\n=superficial fascia= (Fascia subcutanea) is composed of loose connective\r\ntissue which may contain more or less fat and is subcutaneous. The =deep\r\nfascia= is composed of one or more layers of dense fibrous tissue spread\r\nover the surface of the muscles chiefly. Its deep face may be very\r\nloosely attached to the underlying structures or may fuse with the\r\nepimysium, tendons, bones, or ligaments. In some parts, especially the\r\nlimbs, septal plates pass between the muscles and are attached to the\r\nbones or ligaments; these are termed =intermuscular septa=. In this way\r\nmany muscles are inclosed in fibrous sheaths which hold them in\r\nposition. Not uncommonly special bands stretch across the grooves in\r\nwhich tendons play, converting these into canals. Such bands are termed\r\n=vaginal= or =annular ligaments=. The deep fascia is often so distinctly\r\ntendinous in structure, furnishing attachment to special tensor muscles,\r\nas to render the distinction between fascia and aponeurosis quite\r\narbitrary. Bursæ occur in certain situations between the fascia and\r\nunderlying structures (subfascial bursæ), or between the fascia and the\r\nskin (subcutaneous bursæ).\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to divide the description of a muscle into seven heads,\r\nviz.: (1) Name, followed by important synonyms; (2) position and form;\r\n(3) attachments; (4) action; (5) structure; (6) relations; (7) blood and\r\nnerve supply.\r\n\r\n1. The =name= is determined by various factors, viz.: (_a_) The action,\r\n_e. g._, extensor, adductor, etc.; (_b_) the shape, _e. g._, quadratus,\r\ntriangularis; (_c_) the direction, _e. g._, rectus, obliquus; (_d_) the\r\nposition, _e. g._, the subscapularis, iliacus; (_e_) the division (into\r\nheads, etc.), _e. g._, biceps, triceps, etc.; (_f_) the size, _e. g._,\r\nmajor, minor, etc.; (_g_) the attachments, _e. g._, sterno-cephalicus,\r\nmastoido-humeralis; (_h_) the structure, _e. g._, semitendinosus. In\r\nmost cases two or more of these factors have combined to produce the\r\nname, _e. g._, adductor magnus, longus colli, obliquus externus\r\nabdominis.\r\n\r\n2. The =shape= is, in many cases, sufficiently definite to allow the use\r\nof such terms as triangular, quadrilateral, fan-shaped, long, flat,\r\nfusiform, ring-like, etc.\r\n\r\n3. The =attachments= are in most cases to bone, but many muscles are\r\nattached to cartilage, ligaments, fascia, the skin, etc. It is usual to\r\napply the term =origin= to the attachment which always or more commonly\r\nremains fixed when the muscle contracts. The term =insertion= designates\r\nthe movable attachment. Such a distinction cannot always be made, as the\r\naction may be reversible, or both attachments may be freely movable.\r\n\r\n4. The =action= belongs rather to physiological study, but is briefly\r\nindicated in anatomical descriptions.\r\n\r\n5. The =structure= includes the direction of the muscle-fibers, the\r\narrangement of the tendons, the synovial membranes, and any other\r\naccessory structures, _e. g._, annular ligaments and reinforcing sheaths\r\nand bands. The relation of the muscle-fibers to the tendon varies, and\r\nthis fact has given rise to special terms. Thus a muscle in which the\r\nfibers converge to either side of the tendon is termed =bipennate=;\r\nwhile one in which this arrangement exists only on one side of the\r\ntendon is called =unipennate=. The terms fleshy and tendinous are used\r\nto indicate the relative amounts of muscular and tendinous tissue. The\r\nmuscular tissue is often spoken of as the =belly= (Venter) of the\r\nmuscle. In the case of the long muscles, the origin is often termed the\r\n=head= (Caput). Muscles having two or more heads are called biceps,\r\ntriceps, etc. =Digastric= muscles are those which have two bellies\r\njoined by an intermediate tendon. Ring-like muscles which circumscribe\r\nopenings are termed =sphincters=, on account of their action.\r\n\r\n6. The =relations= are, of course, important on surgical grounds.\r\n\r\n7. The =nerve-supply= is of clinical interest, and is important for the\r\ndetermination of homologies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    FASCIÆ AND MUSCLES OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PANNICULUS CARNOSUS\r\n\r\nThe =panniculus carnosus= (Musculus cutaneus) is a thin muscular layer\r\ndeveloped in the superficial fascia. It is intimately adherent in great\r\npart to the skin, but has very little attachment to the skeleton. It\r\ndoes not cover the entire body, and may be conveniently divided into\r\nfacial, cervical, thoracic, and abdominal portions, each of which will\r\nbe described with the muscles of the corresponding region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE FASCIÆ AND MUSCLES OF THE HEAD\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the head may be divided into three groups, viz.: (1)\r\nSuperficial muscles, including the panniculus and those of the lips,\r\ncheeks, nostrils, eyelids, and external ear; (2) the orbital muscles;\r\n(3) the muscles of mastication.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial fascia= forms an almost continuous layer, but is very\r\nscanty around the natural orifices. It contains a number of the thin\r\nsuperficial muscles, so that care must be exercised in removing the\r\nskin. Over the frontal and nasal bones the fascia blends with the\r\nperiosteum.\r\n\r\nThe =deep fascia= is of special interest in three regions. The =temporal\r\nfascia= covers the temporalis muscle, and is attached to the parietal\r\nand frontal crests internally, and to the zygomatic arch externally. The\r\n=buccal fascia= covers the buccinator muscle and the free part of the\r\nouter surface of the ramus of the jaw. Superiorly it is attached to the\r\nfacial crest, and posteriorly it forms a band (Ligamentum\r\npterygomandibulare) which stretches from the hamulus of the pterygoid\r\nbone to the mandible behind the last molar tooth. It is directly\r\ncontinuous with the =pharyngeal fascia=, which is attached to the great\r\nand thyroid cornua of the hyoid bone, covers the lateral walls of the\r\npharynx, and blends dorsally with the median raphé of the constrictor\r\nmuscles of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES\r\n\r\n1. =Panniculus carnosus.=—The facial panniculus (M. cutaneus faciei)\r\nconsists of a thin and usually incomplete muscular stratum, which covers\r\nthe submaxillary space and the masseter muscle. A branch from it passes\r\nforward to the angle of the mouth and blends with the orbicularis oris;\r\nthis part (M. cutaneus labiorum) retracts the angle of the mouth.

The chief attachment is to the skin\r\nof the lids, but some bundles are attached to the palpebral ligament at\r\nthe inner canthus and to the lacrimal bone. Its action is to close the\r\nlids.\r\n\r\n2. =Corrugator supercilii.=—This is a very thin, small muscle, which\r\narises over the root of the supraorbital process and spreads out in the\r\nupper eyelid, blending with the orbicularis. Its action is to assist in\r\nraising the upper lid or, especially in pathological conditions, to\r\nwrinkle the skin.\r\n\r\n3. =Malaris.=—This is a very thin muscle, which varies much in different\r\nsubjects. It extends from the fascia in front of the orbit to the lower\r\nlid. Its action is to depress the lower lid.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing muscles receive their blood-supply from the facial,\r\ntransverse facial, supraorbital, and infraorbital arteries; the\r\nnerve-supply is derived from the facial nerve.\r\n\r\n4. =Levator palpebræ superioris.=—This slender, flat muscle is almost\r\nentirely within the orbital cavity.

Acting singly, it\r\nalso carries the lower jaw toward the side of the contracting muscle.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The superficial face of the muscle in its upper part is\r\ncovered by a strong, glistening aponeurosis, and several tendinous\r\nintersections partially divide the muscle into layers. The fibers of the\r\nsuperficial layer take origin from the malar and maxilla only, and\r\ndiverge somewhat to their insertion close to the thick ventral border of\r\nthe lower jaw. The fibers of the deep layer arise from the entire area\r\nof origin, and pass straight to the border of the mandible; it will be\r\nnoted that a small part, near the temporo-maxillary joint, is not\r\ncovered by the superficial layer.

The inner edge of the muscle is quite thin, but as the fibers\r\nconverge toward the much smaller area of insertion, the muscle becomes\r\nnearly an inch thick. It fuses somewhat with the masseter.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the scutiform cartilage and anterior muscles\r\nof the external ear and the orbital fat; deeply, the temporal fossa and\r\nthe deep temporal vessels and nerves.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Superficial and deep temporal, and mastoid arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Mandibular nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Pterygoideus internus= (s. medialis).—This muscle occupies a\r\nposition on the inner surface of the ramus of the mandible similar to\r\nthat of the masseter on the outside.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The crest formed by the pterygoid process of the sphenoid and\r\nthe palate bone.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The concave inner surface of the broad portion of the ramus\r\nof the mandible, and the inner lip of the lower border.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Acting together, to raise the lower jaw; acting singly, to\r\nproduce also lateral movement of the jaw.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is capable of division into two parts. The\r\nprincipal part is superficial (internal), and its fibers are, for the\r\nmost part, vertical in direction. It contains much tendinous tissue\r\n(septa). The smaller portion is external to the foregoing, and its\r\nfibers are directed downward and backward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 175.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE, SHOWING DEEP\r\n    PTERYGO-MAXILLARY REGION, AND NASAL AND CRANIAL CAVITIES.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cerebral compartment of cranial cavity; _2_, cerebellar\r\n    compartment of same; _3_, tentorium osseum; _4_, tentorium\r\n    cerebelli; _5_, sphenoidal sinus; _6_, hamulus of pterygoid\r\n    bone-tendon of tensor palati cut off short at anterior border of\r\n    hamulus; _7_, mylo-glossus.

The fasciæ of the right and left\r\nsides are attached along the dorsal line of the neck to the ligamentum\r\nnuchæ, while along the ventral line they meet in a fibrous raphé. A deep\r\nlayer is detached which passes underneath the panniculus, bridges over\r\nthe jugular furrow, and crosses over the deep face of the\r\nmastoido-humeralis and omo-hyoideus to join the superficial layer. It\r\nagain separates to pass under the cervical trapezius, and become\r\nattached to the ligamentum nuchæ. Along the ventral line a septum is\r\ndetached which separates the sterno-cephalici. Two other layers in front\r\nof the shoulder inclose the prescapular lymph glands.\r\n\r\nThe =deep fascia= also forms two layers. The =superficial layer= is\r\nattached to the wing of the atlas and the lower edge of the\r\ntrachelo-mastoideus and scalenus. Passing downward, it incloses the\r\ntrachea, and, together with the deep layer, furnishes sheaths for the\r\nvagus and sympathetic nerves and the carotid artery. Passing upward it\r\ndetaches septa between the extensor muscles of the spine. Anteriorly it\r\ncovers the thyroid gland, the guttural pouch, the adjacent vessels and\r\nnerves and the larynx, and is attached to the mastoid process of the\r\ntemporal bone and the thyroid cornu of the hyoid bone. Posteriorly, it\r\nis attached to the first rib and the cariniform cartilage of the\r\nsternum. The =deep layer= (prevertebral fascia) covers the ventral\r\nsurface of the longus colli, and incloses the trachea and œsophagus.\r\nAnteriorly, it forms, with the corresponding layer of the opposite side,\r\na septum between the guttural pouches; posteriorly, it becomes\r\ncontinuous with the endothoracic fascia. A =fascia propria= forms a\r\ntubular sheath around the trachea, inclosing also the recurrent nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            VENTRAL MUSCLES\r\n\r\nThis group consists of eleven pairs of muscles which lie almost entirely\r\nventral to the vertebræ.\r\n\r\n1. =Panniculus carnosus.=—The =cervical panniculus= (platysma myoides of\r\nman) has a fleshy origin on the cariniform cartilage (manubrium) of the\r\nsternum. it passes forward, outward, and upward, crossing over the\r\nsterno-cephalicus and jugular furrow obliquely. On reaching the surface\r\nof the mastoido-humeralis it adheres closely to this muscle, and soon\r\nthins out, to be continued over the splenius and trapezius by an\r\naponeurosis which is difficult to remove from the latter muscle.\r\nScattered bundles may be traced on the ventral surface of the neck to\r\nthe facial portion. The right and left muscles meet at a ventral median\r\nraphé in pennate fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 177.—ANTERO-LATERAL VIEW OF MUSCLES AND SKELETON OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Trapezius; _c_, mastoido-humeralis; _d_, sterno-cephalicus; _f_,\r\n    long head of triceps; _f′_, external head of triceps; _g_, anterior\r\n    superficial pectoral muscle; _g′_, posterior superficial pectoral;\r\n    _h′_, anterior deep pectoral; _v_, cervical panniculus; _z_,\r\n    supraspinatus; _29_, omo-hyoideus; _30_, sterno-thyro-hyoideus;\r\n    _31_, jugular vein; _32_, cephalic vein; _1_, scapula; _1′_,\r\n    cartilage of scapula; _2_, spine of scapula; _4_, shaft of humerus;\r\n    _4′_, external epicondyle; _5_, external tuberosity of humerus; _6_,\r\n    deltoid tuberosity; _14_, ventral border (“keel”) of sternum; _14′_,\r\n    cariniform cartilage; l.R., first rib.

The common belly is then\r\ninterrupted by a tendon, or sometimes two tendons, from which arise\r\nthree or four fleshy bands. The lateral bands diverge to reach their\r\ninsertion into the thyroid cartilage; while the inner bands, closely\r\napplied to each other and blending with the omo-hyoideus, pass straight\r\nforward to reach the ventral surface of the hyoid bone.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—At the root of the neck the common belly has the\r\nsterno-cephalicus below, and the carotid arteries and recurrent nerves\r\nabove. Further forward the trachea becomes the upper relation, and near\r\nthe head the skin and fascia, the lower one.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Carotid artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Ventral branch of the first cervical nerve.\r\n\r\n5. =Omo-hyoideus= (Subscapulo-hyoideus).—This is a thin, ribbon-like\r\nmuscle, almost entirely fleshy, which crosses the trachea very obliquely\r\nunder cover of the mastoido-humeralis.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The subscapular fascia close to the shoulder joint.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The body of the hyoid bone, in common with the hyoid branch\r\nof the preceding muscle.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To depress the hyoid bone.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is composed of parallel fleshy fibers, except at\r\nits origin, where it has a thin tendon.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—In the first part of its course the muscle passes forward\r\nbetween the supraspinatus, anterior deep pectoral, mastoido-humeralis\r\n(outwardly), and the scalenus (inwardly). It is intimately adherent to\r\nthe mastoido-humeralis. In the middle of the neck it is related\r\nsuperficially to the mastoido-humeralis, sterno-cephalicus, and the\r\njugular vein; deeply, to the rectus capitis anterior major, the carotid\r\nartery, the vagus, sympathetic, and recurrent nerves, the trachea, and,\r\non the left side, the œsophagus. In its anterior part the muscle blends\r\nwith the hyoid part of the sterno-thyro-hyoideus, the two covering the\r\nthyroid portion of the latter muscle, the thyroid gland, and the ventral\r\nface of the larynx.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Carotid and inferior cervical arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Ventral branches of the cervical nerves.\r\n\r\n6. =Scalenus= (M. scalenus primæ costæ).—This muscle is deeply situated\r\non the side of the posterior half of the neck.

The =lumbo-dorsal\r\nfascia= (Fascia lumbo-dorsalis) closely invests the muscles, but is\r\neasily stripped off the longissimus. It is attached medially to the\r\nsupraspinous ligament and the spinous processes of the vertebræ;\r\nlaterally, it divides into two layers. The superficial layer is\r\npractically the aponeurosis of the latissimus dorsi. The deep layer\r\ngives origin to the serratus anticus and posticus, the lumbar part of\r\nthe obliquus externus abdominis, the transversus abdominis, and the\r\nretractor costæ. Its lateral edge curves under the longissimus and is\r\nattached to the ribs and lumbar transverse processes. Posteriorly, it is\r\ncontinuous with the gluteal fascia. At the withers it forms an important\r\nstructure, the =dorso-scapular ligament=. This is a strong tendinous\r\nsheet, attached to the third, fourth, and fifth thoracic spines. Its\r\nupper part is very thick and gives origin by its superficial surface to\r\nthe rhomboideus dorsi, by its anterior part to the splenius. The lower\r\npart is thin and elastic, and furnishes numerous lamellæ which intersect\r\nthe scapular part of the serratus and are attached with it to the\r\nscapula. Three lamellæ are detached from the deep face of the ligament.\r\nThe deepest of these passes between the longissimus and spinalis and is\r\nattached to the transverse processes of the first seven thoracic\r\nvertebræ; it gives attachment to the complexus. The middle one dips in\r\nbetween the longissimus and transversalis costarum. The superficial one\r\ngives origin to the serratus anticus. A strong fascial layer, the\r\nilio-lumbar ligament, extends from the last rib to the external angle of\r\nthe ilium.\r\n\r\nThere are nine pairs of muscles in this region, arranged in four layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FIRST LAYER\r\n\r\n1. =Trapezius thoracalis.=\r\n\r\n2. =Latissimus dorsi.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECOND LAYER\r\n\r\n3. =Rhomboideus thoracalis.=\r\n\r\nThe foregoing are described with the other muscles which attach the\r\nthoracic limb to the trunk (p. 251).\r\n\r\n4. =Serratus anticus= (M. serratus dorsalis inspiratorius).—This is a\r\nthin quadrilateral muscle, named from its toothed ventral border. It\r\nlies beneath the rhomboideus, serratus magnus, and latissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The lumbo-dorsal fascia and dorso-scapular ligament.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The external surfaces of the fifth to the eleventh or\r\ntwelfth ribs inclusive.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To draw the ribs on which it is inserted forward and outward,\r\nthus assisting in inspiration.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle arises by means of a thin aponeurosis which\r\nblends with the lumbo-dorsal fascia and the aponeurosis of the\r\nlatissimus dorsi. The muscle-fibers pass downward and backward to be\r\nattached to the ribs by seven or eight digitations below the outer edge\r\nof the transversalis costarum.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the rhomboideus, serratus magnus, latissimus\r\ndorsi, and serratus posticus; deeply, the longissimus dorsi,\r\ntransversalis costarum, external intercostal muscles, and the ribs.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Thoracic nerves.\r\n\r\n5. =Serratus posticus= (M. serratus dorsalis exspiratorius).—This muscle\r\nresembles the preceding one, which it partly covers.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The lumbo-dorsal fascia.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The outer surfaces of the last seven or eight ribs.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To draw the ribs backward, thus assisting in expiration.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—Similar to the preceding muscle. The fibers are directed\r\ndownward and forward and terminate in seven or eight digitations, one or\r\ntwo of which cover the posterior teeth of the anticus. The aponeurosis\r\nblends with that of the latissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the latissimus dorsi and external oblique;\r\ndeeply, the longissimus dorsi, transversalis costarum, external\r\nintercostals, serratus anticus, and the ribs.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal and lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Thoracic nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THIRD LAYER\r\n\r\n6. =Transversalis costarum= (M. ilio-costalis).—This long, segmental\r\nmuscle extends, as its name indicates, across the series of ribs, in\r\ncontact with the outer edge of the longissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The transverse processes of the second and third lumbar\r\nvertebræ and the deep layer of the lumbo-dorsal fascia. (2) The anterior\r\nborders and external surface of the last fifteen ribs.[45]\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The posterior borders of the ribs and the transverse\r\nprocesses of the last two or three cervical vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Chiefly to depress and retract the ribs and so help in\r\nexpiration. Acting together, they may assist in extending this spine,\r\nacting singly in inclining it laterally.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—This muscle presents a distinct segmental arrangement. It\r\nis composed of a series of bundles, the fibers of which are directed\r\nforward and a little downward and outward. From these are detached two\r\nsets of tendons. The superficial tendons spring from the outer edge of\r\nthe muscle. They are flat and are about half an inch in width. Each\r\ncrosses two or three intercostal spaces, to be inserted on the posterior\r\nborder of a rib. The deep tendons are detached from the dorsal part of\r\nthe deep face of the muscle. Each passes backward across one or two\r\nintercostal spaces to its origin on the anterior border or outer surface\r\nof a rib. Small bursæ may be found between the ribs and tendons.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the dorsal serrati and the complexus;\r\ndeeply, the external intercostals and the ribs. The lumbar origin is\r\ncovered by the longissimus. The superior (deep) cervical and dorsal\r\nvessels cross the surface of the muscle at the first and second\r\nintercostal spaces respectively, and branches of the intercostal vessels\r\nand nerves emerge between the transversalis and longissimus; here a\r\nfascial layer dips in between the two.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Dorsal branches of the thoracic nerves.\r\n\r\n7. =Longissimus.=[46]—This is the largest and longest muscle in the\r\nbody. It extends from the sacrum and ilium to the neck, filling up the\r\nspace between the spinous processes medially and the lumbar transverse\r\nprocesses and the upper ends of the ribs below; consequently it has the\r\nform of a three-sided prism.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The internal angle, crest, and adjacent part of the\r\nventral surface of the ilium; (2) the first three sacral spines; (3) the\r\nlumbar and thoracic spines and the supraspinous ligament.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The lumbar transverse and articular processes; (2) the\r\nthoracic transverse processes; (3) the spinous and transverse processes\r\nof the last four cervical vertebræ; (4) the outer surfaces of the ribs,\r\nexcept the first.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Acting with its fellow, it is the most powerful extensor of\r\nthe back and loins; by its cervical attachment it assists in extending\r\nthe neck. By its costal attachment it may also assist in expiration.\r\nActing singly, it flexes the spine laterally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 181.—RIGHT PORTION OF CROSS-SECTION OF BACK OF HORSE.

The posterior part of the muscle is\r\ngreatly developed and constitutes the common mass of the loins. This is\r\ncovered by a strong aponeurosis which blends with the supraspinous and\r\nsacro-iliac ligaments, and is attached to the crest and inner (sacral)\r\nangle of the ilium and the first and second sacral spines; it furnishes\r\norigin to the lumbar portion of the middle gluteus. In its course\r\nfurther forward the muscle receives fasciculi from the lumbar and\r\nthoracic spines, but diminishes somewhat in volume. At the withers it\r\ndivides into two parts. The dorsal division (spinalis et semispinalis),\r\nreinforced by bundles from the first four thoracic spines, passes\r\nforward under the complexus to be inserted into the spines of the last\r\nfour cervical vertebræ. The ventral division passes forward and downward\r\nunderneath the serratus magnus to be inserted into the ribs and the\r\ntransverse processes of the last four cervical vertebræ. Three sets of\r\nfasciculi may be distinguished, viz.: (1) spinal, which are superficial\r\nand internal; (2) transverse, attached to the transverse and articular\r\nprocesses, which are internal and deep; (3) costal, which are external.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the middle gluteus, the lumbo-dorsal fascia,\r\nthe latissimus dorsi, dorsal serrati, serratus magnus, and complexus;\r\ndeeply, the multifidus, intertransversales, external intercostals,\r\nlevatores costarum, the ligamentum nuchæ, and its fellow of the opposite\r\nside (in the neck).\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Dorsal, superior cervical, intercostal, and lumbar\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Dorsal branches of the thoracic and lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n8. =Multifidus dorsi= (semispinalis of the back and loins).—This is a\r\nlong segmental muscle which covers the sides of the spinous processes of\r\nthe vertebræ from the sacrum to the neck.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The lateral portion of the sacrum; (2) the articular\r\nprocesses of the lumbar vertebræ; (3) the transverse processes of the\r\nthoracic vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The spinous processes of the first two sacral, the lumbar,\r\nthoracic, and last cervical vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Acting with its fellow, it is an extensor of the spine; acting\r\nsingly, it flexes it laterally.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—It is composed of a series of bundles which are directed\r\nobliquely forward and upward. Each fasciculus passes over several\r\nvertebræ to its insertion. In the posterior part of the series the\r\nbundles cross two or three vertebræ and are inserted into the summits of\r\nthe spines. Anteriorly, the bundles have a more horizontal direction,\r\ncross three to five vertebræ, and are inserted into the sides of the\r\nspines considerably below their summits. A further complication consists\r\nin the fusion of several bundles into a common insertion.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the longissimus; deeply, the vertebral\r\nspines.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal and lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Dorsal branches of the thoracic and lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n9. =Intertransversales lumborum.=—These are very thin muscular and\r\ntendinous strata, which occupy the spaces between the transverse\r\nprocesses of the lumbar vertebræ except the fifth and sixth.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To assist in flexing the loins laterally.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the longissimus; deeply, the quadratus\r\nlumborum.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE FASCIA AND MUSCLES OF THE TAIL\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the tail are inclosed in the strong =coccygeal fascia=,\r\nwhich is continuous in front with the gluteal fascia and blends with the\r\nlateral sacro-iliac ligament. At the root of the tail it is loosely\r\nattached to the subjacent muscles, but further back it is intimately\r\nadherent to them. From its deep face are detached septa which pass\r\nbetween the muscles to become attached to the vertebræ.\r\n\r\n1. =Coccygeus= (Compressor coccygis; ischio-coccygeus).—This is a flat,\r\ntriangular muscle which lies chiefly between the sacro-sciatic ligament\r\nand the rectum.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The pelvic surface of the sacro-sciatic ligament near the\r\nischiatic spine.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The first four coccygeal vertebræ and the coccygeal fascia.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Acting together, to depress (flex) the tail, compressing it\r\nover the perineum; acting singly, to depress and incline it to the same\r\nside.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The origin of the muscle is aponeurotic. Becoming fleshy,\r\nits fibers pass upward and backward and divide into two layers. The\r\nouter layer is attached to the vertebræ, the inner to the fascia;\r\nincluded between the two lie the intertransversales. When the tail is\r\nraised, the ventral edges of the muscles produce a distinct ridge at\r\neither side of the anus.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Outwardly, the sacro-sciatic ligament and the\r\nsemimembranosus; inwardly, the rectum and the sacro-coccygeus ventralis\r\nmuscle. The internal pudic artery crosses the outer face of the origin\r\nof the muscle.\r\n\r\n2. =Sacro-coccygeus superior= (M. sacro-coccygeus dorsalis medialis;\r\nerector s. extensor coccygis).—This muscle lies along the dorso-median\r\naspect of the tail, in contact with its fellow.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The last three sacral spines and some of the coccygeal spines.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The dorsal surface of the coccygeal vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Acting together, to elevate (extend) the tail; acting singly,\r\nto elevate and incline it laterally.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle has a strong rounded belly. It is inserted by\r\nmeans of short tendons which fuse with those of the next muscle.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the coccygeal fascia; internally, its\r\nfellow; laterally, the sacro-coccygeus lateralis; deeply, the vertebræ.\r\n\r\n3. =Sacro-coccygeus lateralis= (M. sacro-coccygeus dorsalis lateralis;\r\ncurvator coccygis).—This muscle lies immediately lateral to the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 182.—CROSS-SECTION OF TAIL OF HORSE CLOSE TO ANUS.\r\n\r\n  _34_, Coccygeal vertebra; _35_, sacro-coccygeus superior; _36_,\r\n    intertransversalis; _37_, sacro-coccygeus inferior; _38_, coccygeus;\r\n    _39_, recto-coccygeus; _40_, coccygeal fascia.

(After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d.

The belly is fusiform and receives reinforcing\r\nfasciculi from the transverse processes of the sacrum. This is succeeded\r\nby bundles of tendons, as many as four lying alongside of each other.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the lateral sacro-iliac ligament and the\r\ncoccygeal fascia; dorsally, the sacro-coccygeus superior; ventrally, the\r\nintertransversales; deeply, the vertebræ and a branch of the lateral\r\ncoccygeal artery and accompanying vein and nerve.\r\n\r\n4. =Intertransversales caudæ= (Mm. intertransversarii caudæ).—These\r\nconsist of muscular bundles which lie on the lateral aspect of the tail,\r\nbetween the preceding muscle and the sacro-coccygeus inferior. They\r\nbegin on the lateral edge of the sacrum and occupy the spaces between\r\nthe transverse processes, to which they are attached. They are, however,\r\nnot arranged in a strict segmental manner.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Acting together, to fix the coccygeal vertebræ; acting singly,\r\nto assist in lateral flexion.\r\n\r\n5. =Sacro-coccygeus inferior= (Mm. sacro-coccygei ventrales; depressor\r\ncoccygis).—This muscle lies on the ventral aspect of the sacrum and\r\ncoccyx. It is composed of two portions, described by Bourgelat and the\r\nGerman anatomists as separate muscles.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =outer portion= (M. coccygeus ventralis lateralis) is much the\r\nlarger of the two. It arises from the outer part of the ventral surface\r\nof the sacrum, about as far forward as the third foramen, and is\r\ninserted into the transverse processes and ventral surface of the\r\ncoccygeal vertebræ.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =inner portion= (M. sacro-coccygeus ventralis medialis) arises\r\nfrom the ventral surface of the sacrum internal to the preceding muscle\r\nand the first eight coccygeal vertebræ, and is inserted into the ventral\r\nsurfaces of the coccygeal vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Acting together, to depress (flex) the tail; acting singly, to\r\nincline it laterally also.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The outer portion has a somewhat compressed belly, and\r\nreceives bundles from the transverse processes of the coccygeal\r\nvertebræ. The inner portion is much smaller and shorter, reaching only\r\nabout to the middle of the tail.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Ventrally, the pelvic and coccygeal fasciæ; dorsally, the\r\nsacrum, coccygeal vertebræ, and the intertransversales; laterally, the\r\nsacro-sciatic ligament, the coccygeus, and the coccygeal fascia;\r\nmedially, its fellow, the recto-coccygeus, and the middle coccygeal\r\nvessels. Branches of the lateral coccygeal vessels and nerves lie\r\nbetween the outer division of the muscle and the intertransversales.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Middle and lateral coccygeal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Coccygeal nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE MUSCLES OF THE THORAX\r\n\r\nThese consist of seven muscles or sets of muscles, which are attached to\r\nthe thoracic vertebræ, to the ribs and their cartilages, and to the\r\nsternum. Functionally, they are muscles of respiration.\r\n\r\n1. =Levatores costarum.=—These constitute a series of small muscles\r\nwhich occupy and overlie the upper ends of the intercostal spaces.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The transverse processes of the thoracic vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The external surfaces of the upper ends of the ribs\r\nposterior to the vertebral origin.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To draw the ribs forward in inspiration.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—Arising by tendinous fibers, each muscle passes backward\r\nand outward and expands at its insertion. Some fibers pass over one rib\r\nand are inserted on a succeeding one. At the first and last spaces the\r\nmuscle cannot be distinguished from the external intercostal, of which\r\nit is in reality only a specially developed part.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the longissimus dorsi; deeply, the ribs,\r\ninternal intercostal muscles, and the intercostal vessels and nerves.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Intercostal nerves.\r\n\r\n2. =External intercostals= (Mm. intercostales externi).—Each of these\r\noccupies an intercostal space, from the levatores to the sternal\r\nextremity of the rib. They do not occupy the intercartilaginous spaces.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The posterior borders of the ribs.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The anterior borders and external surfaces of the\r\nsucceeding ribs.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To draw the ribs forward in inspiration.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The fibers are directed downward and backward. There is a\r\nconsiderable admixture of tendinous tissue. The thickness of the muscles\r\ngradually diminishes toward the lower ends of the spaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 184.—DORSAL AND LUMBAR REGIONS OF HORSE, DORSAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the serratus magnus, latissimus dorsi,\r\nserratus anticus and posticus, longissimus dorsi, transversalis\r\ncostarum, rectus thoracis, deep pectorals, obliquus abdominis externus,\r\nand panniculus; deeply, the internal intercostals and (in the upper part\r\nof the spaces) the intercostal vessels and nerves.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal and internal thoracic arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Intercostal nerves.\r\n\r\n3. =Internal intercostals= (Mm. intercostales interni).—These occupy the\r\nentire length of the intercostal spaces, including their interchondral\r\nportion.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The anterior borders of the ribs and their cartilages.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The posterior borders of the preceding ribs and cartilages.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To draw the ribs backward in expiration. It seems probable,\r\nhowever, that the intercartilaginous portion is inspiratory.[47]\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The direction of the fibers is oblique downward and\r\nforward. There is a smaller amount of tendinous tissue than in the\r\nexternal set, and the thickness diminishes from below upward. In the\r\nupper part of the spaces fibers sometimes cross a rib in a fashion\r\nsimilar to the subcostals of man. A thin aponeurosis separates the\r\ninternal from the external intercostal muscle in each space.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the levatores costarum and the external\r\nintercostals; deeply, the endothoracic fascia and pleura, the\r\ntransversus thoracis, diaphragm, transversus abdominis, and the internal\r\nthoracic and asternal vessels. In the upper part of the intercostal\r\nspaces the intercostal vessels and nerves lie between the internal and\r\nexternal intercostal muscle, but below they lie chiefly on the deep face\r\nof the inner muscle.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal and internal thoracic arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Intercostal nerves.\r\n\r\n4. =Retractor costæ.=—This is a small triangular muscle which lies\r\nbehind the last rib, chiefly under cover of the serratus posticus.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The transverse processes of the first three or four lumbar\r\nvertebræ by means of the lumbar fascia.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The posterior border of the last rib.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To retract the last rib.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle arises by a thin aponeurosis. Its fibers are\r\nparallel to those of the adjacent internal oblique.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the serratus posticus and external oblique;\r\ndeeply, the transversus abdominis.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n5. =Rectus thoracis= (M. transversus costarum; lateralis sterni).—This\r\nis a thin muscle which lies under cover of the deep pectoral muscles. It\r\nis directed obliquely backward and downward, and crosses the lower part\r\nof the first three intercostal spaces.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The outer surface of the first rib, below the scalenus.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The cartilage of the third or fourth rib. The aponeurosis\r\nusually joins the rectus abdominis. It may reach the sternum.\r\n\r\n_Action._—It may assist in inspiration or concur with the rectus\r\nabdominis.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the deep pectoral muscles; deeply, the\r\nintercostal muscles and the ribs.\r\n\r\n6. =Transversus thoracis= (Triangularis sterni).—This is a flat muscle\r\nsituated on the thoracic surface of the sternum and the cartilages of\r\nthe sternal ribs.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The sternal ligament.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The cartilages of the ribs, from the second to the eighth\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\n_Action._—It draws the costal cartilages inward and backward, thus\r\nassisting in expiration.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—Each muscle has the form of a scalene triangle, of which\r\nthe base is the strongly serrated external border. The muscle contains a\r\ngood deal of tendinous tissue. The anterior bundles are directed forward\r\nand outward; the posterior backward and outward.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superiorly, the endothoracic fascia and pleura; inferiorly,\r\nthe costal cartilages, the internal intercostal muscles, and the\r\ninternal thoracic vessels.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Internal thoracic artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—The intercostal nerves.\r\n\r\n7. =Diaphragm.=—This is a broad, unpaired muscle which forms a partition\r\nbetween the thoracic and abdominal cavities.[48] In outline it has some\r\nresemblance to a palm-leaf fan. In form it is dome-shaped, compressed\r\nlaterally. On a median section it is seen to have a general direction\r\ndownward and forward from the lumbar vertebræ to the xiphoid cartilage.\r\nThe thoracic surface is strongly convex, and is covered by the pleura.\r\nThe abdominal surface is deeply concave, and is covered for the most\r\npart by the peritoneum. The muscle consists of a peripheral fleshy\r\nportion, two muscular crura, and a tendinous center.\r\n\r\n_Attachments._—(1) =Costal part=: The cartilages of the ninth to the\r\nfifteenth ribs, and the last three ribs at an increasing distance from\r\ntheir sternal ends.\r\n\r\n(2) =Sternal part=: The upper surface of the xiphoid cartilage.\r\n\r\n(3) =Lumbar part=: (_a_) The =right crus= is attached to the inferior\r\ncommon ligament, and by this means to the first four or five lumbar\r\nvertebræ. (_b_) The =left crus= is attached in a similar fashion to the\r\nfirst and second lumbar vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Action._—It is the principal muscle of inspiration and increases the\r\nlongitudinal diameter of the chest. The contraction produces a general\r\nlessening of the curvature of the diaphragm. In the expiratory phase the\r\ncostal part and crura lie directly on the body walls, so that the bases\r\nof the lungs are in contact with the tendinous center and sternal\r\nportion only. In ordinary inspiration the fleshy rim recedes from the\r\nchest-wall, so that the bases of the lungs move backward to a line about\r\nparallel with the curve formed by the cartilages of the asternal ribs,\r\nand about four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) therefrom. It is stated\r\nthat the inspiratory movement affects the tendinous center much less\r\nthan the fleshy part, since the posterior vena cava is firmly attached\r\nto the former. It should be noted, however, that the direction of the\r\nthoracic part of the vena cava in the expiratory phase is oblique upward\r\nand backward. Thus it would seem that there is no anatomical reason why\r\nthe diaphragm should not move as a whole in ordinary inspiration at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The =costal part= (Pars costalis) consists of a series of\r\ndigitations which meet, or are separated by a very narrow interval from,\r\nthe transversus abdominis; between the two are the asternal vessels.\r\nFrom the tenth rib backward the attachments are to the ribs at an\r\nincreasing distance above the costo-chondral junctions. Thus at the last\r\nrib the attachment is four to five inches (10 to 12 cm.) from the lower\r\nend. Anteriorly, the origin extends along the ninth costal cartilage to\r\nthe xiphoid cartilage. From these points of origin the fibers curve\r\ninward and forward to join the tendinous center. The =right crus= (Crus\r\ndextrum) is about twice as thick as the left one and is also longer. It\r\narises by a strong tendon from the lumbar vertebræ (by means of the\r\ninferior common ligament). The tendon is succeeded by a rounded belly\r\nwhich leaves the vertebral column, at the last thoracic vertebra.\r\nPassing downward and forward, its fibers spread out and join the\r\ntendinous center. The =left crus= (Crus sinistrum) arises by a thin\r\ntendon from the inferior common ligament at the first and second lumbar\r\nvertebræ. This is succeeded by a triangular belly which joins the\r\ncentral tendon. Between the crura and the attachment to the last rib the\r\nedge of the muscle crosses the ventral surface of the psoas muscles\r\nwithout attachment, forming the so-called lumbo-costal arch; here the\r\nthoracic and abdominal cavities are separated only by the serous\r\nmembranes and some areolar tissue. The =tendinous center= (Centrum\r\ntendineum) resembles the periphery in outline, but is more elongated. It\r\nis partially divided into right and left halves by the descent of the\r\ncrura into it. It is composed largely of radiating fibers, but many\r\ninterlace in various directions; this is specially evident around the\r\nforamen venæ cavæ, which is encircled by fibers. A strong tendinous\r\nlayer extends across below the hiatus œsophageus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 185.—DIAPHRAGM OF HORSE, ABDOMINAL SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Inferior common ligament; _2_, _2′_, tendons of crura; _3_,\r\n    lumbar sympathetic trunks; _4_, external spermatic nerve; _5_, _5′_,\r\n    great splanchnic nerves; _6_, cisterna chyli (opened); _7_, _7′_,\r\n    œsophageal continuations of vagus nerves; _8_, lymph gland; _9_,\r\n    coronary ligament of liver (cut); _10_, right lateral ligament of\r\n    liver (cut); _11_, left lateral ligament of liver (cut); _12_,\r\n    falciform ligament of liver (cut); _A.l._, lumbo-costal arch;\r\n    _N.i._, intercostal nerve; _C.d._, right crus; _C.s._, left crus;\r\n    _A_, aorta; _Ca_, cœliac artery; _Oe._, œsophagus; _V.c._, posterior\r\n    vena cava; _V.p._, phrenic veins. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d.\r\n    Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm is pierced by three foramina. (1) The =hiatus aorticus= is\r\nan interval between the two crura and below the last thoracic vertebra.\r\nIt contains the posterior aorta, vena azygos, and cisterna chyli. (2)\r\nThe =hiatus œsophageus= (or foramen sinistrum) perforates the right crus\r\nnear its junction with the tendinous center. It is situated a little to\r\nthe left of the median plane and two or three inches below the\r\nthirteenth thoracic vertebra (in expiration). It transmits the\r\nœsophagus, the vagus nerves, and the œsophageal branch of the gastric\r\nartery. (3) The =foramen venæ cavæ= (s. dextrum) pierces the tendinous\r\ncenter about an inch to the right of the median plane, and about six\r\ninches below the twelfth thoracic vertebra (in expiration). The vena\r\ncava is firmly attached to the margin of the opening.[49]\r\n\r\n_Relations._—The thoracic surface is related to the endothoracic fascia,\r\npleuræ, pericardium, the bases of the lungs, and the ribs in part. The\r\nabdominal surface is in great part covered by the peritoneum, and is\r\nrelated chiefly to the liver, stomach, spleen, pancreas, kidneys and\r\nadrenals, and the anterior flexures of the colon. The sympathetic and\r\nsplanchnic nerves pass between the crus and the psoas muscles on each\r\nside. The asternal vessels perforate the edge of the muscle at the ninth\r\ncosto-chondral joint.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Phrenic and asternal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Phrenic nerves (from the fifth, sixth, and seventh\r\ncervical nerves).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES\r\n\r\nThe =superficial fascia= covering the lateral and ventral walls of the\r\nabdomen is continuous dorsally with the lumbo-dorsal fascia, in front\r\nwith the thoracic fascia, and behind with the gluteal fascia. In the\r\ninguinal region it forms part of the fascia of the penis or of the\r\nmammary glands. At the lower part of the flank it forms a fold which is\r\ncontinuous with the fascia of the thigh near the stifle joint. In this\r\nfold are the precrural lymph glands. Medially it blends with the linea\r\nalba. It contains the abdominal portion of the panniculus carnosus.\r\n\r\nThe =abdominal panniculus= (M. cutaneus maximus) covers a large part of\r\nthe lateral surface of the abdomen and thorax. The general direction of\r\nits fibers is longitudinal. Its posterior extremity forms the basis of\r\nthe fold of the flank. Its anterior extremity is inserted by a thin\r\ntendon into the internal tuberosity of the humerus, with the posterior\r\ndeep pectoral muscle. Its dorsal edge may be indicated by a line drawn\r\nfrom the upper end of the thirteenth rib to the fold of the flank. Its\r\nventral limit corresponds to a line drawn from the fold to a point about\r\na handbreadth external to the umbilicus, and from here to a point a\r\nlittle above the level of the elbow. Behind the shoulder the fibers\r\nbecome oblique and blend with the scapular portion. The aponeurosis\r\nextends ventrally to the linea alba, dorsally to the supraspinous\r\nligament. The muscle is intimately adherent to the skin, so that special\r\ncare is necessary in removing the latter. Its deep face, on the other\r\nhand, is loosely attached to the underlying structures by a quantity of\r\nareolar tissue which is more or less loaded with fat (panniculus\r\nadiposus) in animals in good condition. The large external thoracic\r\n(“spur”) vein is partially embedded in the lower part of the muscle. Its\r\naction is to twitch the skin.\r\n\r\nThe =deep fascia= is represented chiefly by the =abdominal= tunic\r\n(Tunica flava abdominis). This is a sheet of elastic tissue which\r\nassists the muscles in supporting the great weight of the abdominal\r\nviscera. It is practically coextensive with the obliquus externus, which\r\nit covers. Ventrally it is thick, and is intimately adherent to the\r\naponeurosis of the muscle. Laterally it becomes thinner and is more\r\neasily separated, although fibers from it dip in between the\r\nmuscle-bundles. It is continued for some distance upon the intercostals\r\nand serratus magnus. Traced forward, it passes as a thin layer beneath\r\nthe posterior deep pectoral muscle. Posteriorly it is attached to the\r\nexternal angle of the ilium. In the inguinal region it forms the deep\r\nfascia of the prepuce or of the mammary glands.\r\n\r\nThe =linea alba= is a median fibrous raphé which extends from the\r\nxiphoid cartilage to the symphysis pubis. It is formed chiefly by the\r\njunction of the aponeuroses of the oblique and transverse muscles, but\r\npartly by longitudinal fibers. A little behind its middle is a cicatrix\r\nwhich indicates the position of the umbilical opening of the fœtus.\r\n\r\n1. =Obliquus abdominis externus= (great oblique; external oblique of the\r\nabdomen).—This is the most extensive of the abdominal muscles. It is a\r\nbroad sheet, irregularly triangular in shape, widest behind. Its fibers\r\nare directed chiefly downward and backward.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The outer surfaces of the last fourteen ribs, and the\r\nfascia over the external intercostal muscles; (2) the lumbo-dorsal\r\nfascia.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The linea alba and the prepubic tendon; (2) the\r\nexternal angle and shaft of the ilium; (3) the internal femoral fascia.\r\n\r\n_Action._—(1) To compress the abdominal viscera, as in defecation,\r\nmicturition, parturition, and expiration; (2) to flex the trunk (arch\r\nthe back); (3) acting singly, to flex the trunk laterally.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is composed of a fleshy portion and an\r\naponeurosis. The =muscular portion= lies on the lateral wall of the\r\nthorax and abdomen. It arises by a series of digitations, the anterior\r\nfour of which alternate with those of the serratus magnus. The origin\r\nmay be indicated by a slightly curved line (concave above) drawn from\r\nthe lower part of the fifth rib to the external angle of the ilium. The\r\nfibers are directed downward and backward and terminate on the\r\naponeurosis, except in the flank, where they are almost horizontal in\r\ndirection. The line of junction is a curve (concave above) extending\r\nfrom the upper edge of the posterior deep pectoral muscle toward the\r\nexternal angle of the ilium. The =aponeurosis= is intimately attached to\r\nthe abdominal tunic, and its fibers are largely interwoven ventrally\r\nwith those of the aponeurosis of the internal oblique. By this fusion is\r\nformed the outer sheath of the rectus abdominis, which blends at the\r\nlinea alba with that of the opposite side. In the inguinal region the\r\naponeurosis divides into two chief layers; one of these curves upward\r\nand backward and is inserted into the external angle of the ilium and\r\nthe prepubic tendon. Between these points the aponeurosis is much\r\nstrengthened and is called the =inguinal= (Poupart’s) =ligament=\r\n(Ligamentum inguinale). This curves upward and somewhat forward, becomes\r\nthin, and blends with the iliac fascia. It forms the posterior wall of\r\nthe inguinal canal. About an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.) in front of the pubis\r\nand about two inches (ca. 4 to 5 cm.) from the median plane the\r\naponeurosis is pierced by a slit-like opening,[50] the =external\r\ninguinal ring= (Annulus inguinalis subcutaneus). This is the external\r\norifice of the inguinal canal. Its long axis is directed outward and\r\nforward, and is about four inches (ca. 10 cm.) in length. The inner\r\nangle is rounded and is well defined by the junction of the inguinal\r\nligament with the prepubic tendon, but the outer angle is not so sharply\r\ndefined. The borders or pillars are constituted by arciform fibers of\r\nthe aponeurosis of the external oblique (Crus mediale, laterale). The\r\n=femoral layer= of the aponeurosis (Lamina femoralis) passes on to the\r\ninner surface of the thigh, where it blends with the femoral fascia. A\r\nthin =iliac layer= (Lamina iliaca) passes over the outer margin of the\r\niliacus to the external border of the ilium.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, the panniculus carnosus, the\r\nabdominal tunic, and the posterior deep pectoral muscle; deeply, the\r\nribs and their cartilages, the intercostal muscles, the internal\r\noblique, the contents of the inguinal canal, and the sartorius and\r\ngracilis.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal and lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Intercostal and lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n2. =Obliquus abdominis internus= (small oblique; internal oblique of the\r\nabdomen).—This muscle is situated under the preceding one. Its fibers\r\nare directed downward, forward, and inward. It forms a triangular curved\r\nsheet with the base behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 186.—VENTRAL MUSCLES OF HORSE, AFTER REMOVAL OF GREATER PART OF\r\n    PANNICULUS CARNOSUS AND ABDOMINAL TUNIC.

(After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. f. Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The external angle of the ilium and the adjacent part of the\r\ninguinal (Poupart’s) ligament.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The cartilages of the last four or five ribs; (2) the\r\nlinea alba and the prepubic tendon.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Similar to that of the preceding muscle.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—Like the external oblique, it is composed of a fleshy\r\nportion and an aponeurosis. The fleshy portion is fan-shaped, and is\r\nsituated chiefly in the flank. At its iliac origin it is covered by a\r\nglistening aponeurosis. Traced inward and downward along the abdominal\r\nsurface of the inguinal ligament, the muscular origin is found to become\r\nmuch thinner, and also becomes loosely attached to the ligament. About\r\nfour or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) from the linea alba the muscle\r\nseparates from the ligament and forms the anterior wall of the inguinal\r\ncanal. The abdominal orifice of the canal, the =internal inguinal\r\nring=[51] (Annulus inguinalis abdominalis), is found here. It is\r\nnormally a narrow slit, bounded in front by the edge of the internal\r\noblique, and behind by the inguinal ligament. The =aponeurosis= is to a\r\ngreat extent blended with that of the external oblique, being, indeed,\r\nconsiderably interwoven with it ventrally. Where it covers the rectus\r\nabdominis it is attached to the tendinous inscriptions of that muscle.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the external oblique; deeply, the rectus\r\nabdominis, transversus abdominis, and the peritoneum.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Circumflex iliac, lumbar, and intercostal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Ventral branches of the lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n3. =Rectus Abdominis.=—This muscle is confined to the ventral part of\r\nthe abdominal wall; it extends from the lower part of the chest-wall to\r\nthe pubis.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The cartilages of the fifth to the ninth ribs inclusive, and\r\nthe adjacent surface of the sternum.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The pubis, by means of the prepubic tendon.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Similar to that of the oblique muscles. It is specially\r\nadapted to flex the lumbo-sacral joints and the lumbar and thoracic\r\nparts of the spine.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The fibers of the muscle are directed longitudinally. Nine\r\nto eleven transverse bands of fibrous tissue extend in an irregular\r\nmanner across the muscle. These are termed =inscriptiones tendineæ=.\r\nThey strengthen the muscle and serve to prevent separation of its\r\nfibers. The width of the muscle is greatest about its middle.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the aponeuroses of the oblique muscles\r\n(which constitute the external rectus sheath), and the posterior deep\r\npectoral; deeply, the transversus, intercostals, the cartilages of the\r\nribs, and the sternum. The posterior abdominal artery runs along the\r\nouter edge of the muscle posteriorly, and the anterior abdominal artery\r\non or in its anterior part.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Anterior and posterior abdominal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Intercostal and lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n4. =Transversus abdominis.=—This muscle, named from the general\r\ndirection of its fibers, is a triangular curved sheet. Its lateral part\r\nis muscular, its ventral aponeurotic.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The inner surfaces of the distal ends or the cartilages of\r\nthe asternal ribs, meeting the costal attachment of the diaphragm; (2)\r\nthe transverse processes of the lumbar vertebræ, by means of the deep\r\nlayer of the lumbo-dorsal fascia.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The xiphoid cartilage and the linea alba.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Similar to that of the oblique muscles.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The =muscular part= is a sheet of parallel bundles of\r\nfibers, directed downward and inward. It is thickest over the cartilages\r\nof the ribs, and from here it thins out greatly toward the aponeurosis\r\nand the lumbar region. The fibers of the =aponeurosis= directly continue\r\nthose of the fleshy part. Posteriorly it becomes extremely thin and\r\nblends with the aponeuroses of the oblique muscles. It covers the deep\r\nface of the rectus, so forming the internal rectus sheath.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the oblique and straight muscles, the\r\nretractor costæ, the cartilages of the asternal ribs, and the internal\r\nintercostal muscles; deeply, the transversalis fascia and the\r\nperitoneum. The =transversalis fascia= is little developed in the horse,\r\nand is very thin in emaciated subjects, but in animals in good condition\r\nit contains a good deal of fat. It blends with the iliac fascia and\r\ndescends into the inguinal canal. The asternal artery runs along the\r\ninterval between the origin of the transversus and the costal part of\r\nthe diaphragm. The intercostal nerves pass down over the external\r\nsurface of the muscle, to which they give branches. Branches of the\r\nfirst three lumbar nerves are similarly disposed further back.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal, lumbar, and asternal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Intercostal and lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n5. =Cremaster externus.=—This small muscle may be regarded as a detached\r\nportion of the internal oblique, with which it blends at its origin\r\n(Figs. 272, 450).\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The iliac fascia, near the origin of the sartorius.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The tunica vaginalis communis.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To raise the tunica vaginalis, and with it the testicle.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle arises by a thin aponeurosis which is succeeded\r\nby a flat muscular belly about one and a half to two inches (ca. 4 to 5\r\ncm.) in width.[52] It passes down the inguinal canal on the\r\npostero-external surface of the tunica vaginalis, to which it is rather\r\nloosely attached. On reaching the point where the tunic is reflected on\r\nto the tail of the epididymis, the muscle is firmly attached to the\r\nouter surface of the tunic by short tendinous fibers.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—The muscle lies between the peritoneum and the fascia\r\ntransversalis in front and the iliac fascia and inguinal ligament\r\nbehind. On reaching the internal ring it descends the inguinal canal on\r\nthe postero-external surface of the tunica vaginalis communis.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—External spermatic or cremasteric artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—External spermatic nerve.\r\n\r\n=The Inguinal Canal.=—This term (Canalis inguinalis) is applied to an\r\noblique passage through the posterior part of the abdominal wall.[53] It\r\nbegins at the internal inguinal or abdominal ring, and extends obliquely\r\ndownward, inward, and somewhat forward, to end at the external inguinal\r\nor subcutaneous ring. Its anterior wall is formed by the fleshy\r\nposterior part of the internal oblique muscle, and the posterior wall by\r\nthe strong tendinous inguinal (Poupart’s) ligament. The average length\r\nof the canal, measured along the spermatic cord, is about four inches\r\n(ca. 10 cm.). The =internal inguinal ring= (Annulus inguinalis\r\nabdominalis) is bounded in front by the thin margin of the internal\r\noblique muscle, and behind by the inguinal ligament. It is directed\r\napproximately from the edge of the prepubic tendon toward the external\r\nangle of the ilium. Its length is about four or five inches (ca. 10 to\r\n12 cm.). The edge of the muscle is attached to the surface of the\r\nligament here by delicate connective tissue, except where structures\r\nintervene between the walls of the canal. Consequently the limits of the\r\nring are not very clearly defined. The =external inguinal ring= (Annulus\r\ninguinalis subcutaneus) is a well defined slit in the aponeurosis of the\r\nexternal oblique muscle, situated lateral to the prepubic tendon. Its\r\nlong axis is directed from the edge of the prepubic tendon outward and\r\nforward, and its average length is about four inches (ca. 10 cm.). The\r\ncanal contains in the male the spermatic cord, the tunica vaginalis, the\r\nexternal cremaster muscle, the external pudic artery and a small\r\nsatellite vein, and the inguinal lymph vessels and nerves. In the female\r\nit contains the mammary vessels and nerves; in the bitch it also lodges\r\nthe round ligament of the uterus, inclosed in a tubular process of\r\nperitoneum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The two rings do not correspond in direction, so that the length of\r\n  the canal varies greatly when measured at different points. The inner\r\n  angle of the internal ring lies almost immediately above that of the\r\n  external ring, but the outer angle is situated five to six inches (ca.\r\n  12 to 15 cm.) from that of the external ring. The inner angles of the\r\n  external rings are well defined and distinctly palpable in the living\r\n  subject; they are about three to four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Prepubic Tendon.=—The =prepubic tendon= is essentially the tendon\r\nof insertion of the two recti abdominis, but also furnishes attachment\r\nto the obliqui, the graciles, and the pectinei. It is attached to the\r\nanterior borders of the pubic bones, including the ilio-pectineal\r\neminences. It has the form of a very strong thick band, with concave\r\nlateral borders which form the inner boundaries of the external inguinal\r\nrings. Its direction is oblique upward and backward.[54] Its structure\r\nis somewhat complex. Most of the fibers of the posterior part extend\r\nfrom one ilio-pectineal eminence to the other. The fibers which belong\r\nto the recti curve in to the median line. The aponeuroses of the\r\ninternal oblique muscles are inserted into its abdominal surface, and\r\nthe inguinal ligaments are attached to and continue across it in\r\narciform fashion. The anterior part of the tendon of origin of the\r\ngracilis is fused with it ventrally, and many of the fibers of the\r\npectineus arise from it. It gives off on either side a strong round\r\nband, the so-called =pubo-femoral= or =accessory ligament=, which is\r\ninserted into the fossa of the head of the femur with the round ligament\r\n(_vide_ hip joint).\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MUSCLES OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\nI. THE MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER GIRDLE (Figs. 177, 178, 179, 186)\r\n\r\nThis group consists of those muscles which connect the thoracic limb\r\nwith the head, neck, and trunk. The group naturally falls into two\r\ndivisions—dorsal and ventral.[55]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A. DORSAL DIVISION\r\n\r\nThis division consists of two layers which overlie the proper muscles of\r\nthe neck and back.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FIRST LAYER\r\n\r\n1. =Trapezius.=—This is a flat, triangular muscle, the base of the\r\ntriangle corresponding with the spine. It is divided by an aponeurotic\r\nportion into two divisions:\r\n\r\n(=a=) =Trapezius cervicalis.=—_Origin._—The funicular portion of the\r\nligamentum nuchæ, from the second cervical to the third thoracic\r\nvertebra.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The spine of the scapula and the fascia of the shoulder and\r\narm.\r\n\r\n(=b=) =Trapezius thoracalis s. dorsalis.=—_Origin._—The supraspinous\r\nligament, from the third to the tenth thoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The tubercle of the spine of the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Acting as a whole, to elevate the shoulder; the cervical\r\nportion draws the scapula forward and upward and the thoracic portion\r\ndraws it backward and upward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle arises by a short, thin aponeurosis, from which\r\nthe fibers of the flat fleshy portion converge to the spine of the\r\nscapula and the aponeurosis which separates the two portions. The\r\ncervical fascia joins the ventral edge of the cervical portion to the\r\nmastoido-humeralis, or the two muscles may unite here.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin and fascia; deeply, the\r\nrhomboideus, latissimus dorsi, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, deltoid,\r\nsplenius, serratus magnus, and anterior deep pectoral muscles, and the\r\ncartilage of the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Deep cervical and intercostal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Spinal accessory nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECOND LAYER\r\n\r\nThis consists of two muscles—the rhomboideus and the latissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\n2. =Rhomboideus.=—This consists of two portions:\r\n\r\n(=a=) =Rhomboideus cervicalis s. cervicis.=—_Origin._—The funicular\r\nportion of the ligamentum nuchæ, from the second cervical to the second\r\nthoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The internal surface of the cartilage of the scapula.\r\n\r\n(=b=) =Rhomboideus thoracalis s. dorsalis.=—_Origin._—The spinous\r\nprocesses of the second to the seventh thoracic vertebra by means of the\r\ndorso-scapular ligament.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The inner surface of the cartilage of the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To draw the scapula upward and forward. When the limb is fixed\r\nthe cervical portion will elevate the neck.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The cervical portion is narrow, pointed at its anterior\r\nextremity, and lies along the funicular part of the ligamentum nuchæ, to\r\nwhich it is attached by short tendon bundles. The fibers are directed\r\nfor the most part longitudinally. The thoracic portion is quadrilateral\r\nin shape, and its fibers are nearly vertical. Its deep face is\r\nintimately attached to the dorso-scapular ligament.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin and fascia (over a small area), the\r\ntrapezius, and the cartilage of the scapula; deeply, the dorso-scapular\r\nligament, the splenius, complexus, longissimus dorsi, and serratus\r\nanticus.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Dorsal and superior cervical arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Sixth cervical nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Latissimus Dorsi.=—This is a wide muscle which has the form of a\r\nright-angled triangle. It lies for the most part under the skin and\r\npanniculus, on the lateral wall of the thorax, from the spine to the\r\narm.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The lumbo-dorsal fascia—and by this means from the lumbar and\r\nthoracic spines as far forward as the highest point of the withers.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The internal tubercle of the humerus, in common with the\r\nteres major.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To draw the humerus upward and backward and flex the shoulder\r\njoint. If the limb is advanced and fixed, it draws the trunk forward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle arises by a wide aponeurosis, which fuses with\r\nthat of the serratus posticus and with the lumbo-dorsal fascia. The\r\nmuscular portion is at first rather thin, but by the convergence of its\r\nfibers becomes thicker as it approaches the arm. The anterior fibers\r\npass almost vertically downward over the dorsal angle of the scapula and\r\nits cartilage. The posterior fibers are directed downward and forward.\r\nThe thick belly formed by the convergence of these passes under the\r\ntriceps to end on the flat tendon of insertion, which is common to this\r\nmuscle and the teres major.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Subscapular, intercostal, and lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Brachial plexus (eighth cervical and dorsal roots).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          B. VENTRAL DIVISION\r\n\r\n1. =Mastoido-humeralis= (M. brachiocephalicus; levator humeri).—This\r\nmuscle extends along the side of the neck from the head to the arm. It\r\nis incompletely divisible into two portions.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The mastoid process of the petrous temporal bone and the\r\noccipital crest; (2) the wing of the atlas and the transverse processes\r\nof the second, third, and fourth cervical vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The deltoid tuberosity and the curved rough line which\r\nextends from this to the distal extremity of the humerus.\r\n\r\n_Action._—When the head and neck are fixed, to draw the limb forward,\r\nextending the shoulder joint. When the limb is fixed, to extend the head\r\nand neck, if the muscles act together; acting separately, to incline the\r\nhead and neck to the same side.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—As already mentioned, the muscle is capable of incomplete\r\ndivision into two parts, the line of division being indicated by the\r\nemergence of superficial branches of the ventral divisions of the\r\ncervical nerves. The mastoid portion (M. cleido-mastoideus) partly\r\noverlaps the other portion (M. cleido-transversarius), which lies dorsal\r\nto it. The former is attached to the mastoid process and the occipital\r\nbone by a broad tendon which fuses with that of the splenius and\r\ntrachelo-mastoideus; it is also attached to the tendon of insertion of\r\nthe sterno-cephalicus by aponeurosis. The dorsal portion is attached to\r\nthe transverse processes by four fleshy digitations. The belly of the\r\nmuscle is adherent superficially to the cervical fascia and the\r\npanniculus, and deeply to the subscapulo-hyoideus. In front of the\r\nshoulder its deep face is marked by a tendinous intersection of variable\r\ndevelopment.[56] Here the muscle becomes wider, covers the shoulder\r\njoint, passes between the brachialis and biceps, and is inserted by\r\nmeans of a wide tendon which it shares with the superficial pectoral\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, cervical fascia, the parotid\r\ngland, the panniculus, brachialis, and branches of the cervical nerves;\r\ndeeply, the splenius, trachelo-mastoideus, rectus capitis anterior\r\nmajor, omo-hyoideus, serratus magnus, anterior deep pectoral and biceps\r\nmuscles, the inferior cervical artery, the prescapular lymph glands, and\r\nbranches of the cervical nerves. The ventral edge of the muscle forms\r\nthe dorsal boundary of the jugular furrow. The dorsal border may be in\r\ncontact with the cervical trapezius, or separated from it by a variable\r\ninterval.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Inferior cervical, carotid, and vertebral arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Spinal accessory and cervical nerves.\r\n\r\nThe =pectoral fascia= is a thin membrane covering the surface of the\r\npectoral muscles, to which it is, for the most part, pretty intimately\r\nattached. It detaches a layer which passes between the superficial and\r\ndeep pectorals. At the posterior edge of the triceps another layer is\r\ngiven off, which passes on the outer surface of this muscle to blend\r\nwith the scapular fascia; the deeper layer becomes continuous with the\r\nsubscapular and cervical fasciæ.\r\n\r\nThe =pectoral muscles= form a large fleshy mass which occupies the space\r\nbetween the ventral part of the chest-wall and the shoulder and arm.\r\nThey are clearly divisible into a superficial and a deep layer. The\r\nsuperficial layer may be subdivided into two portions by careful\r\ndissection; the deep layer is clearly made up of two muscles.\r\n\r\n2. =Superficial pectoral= (M. pectoralis superficialis).\r\n\r\n(=a=) =Anterior superficial pectoral= (portio clavicularis s.\r\ndescendens; pectoralis anticus).—This is a short, thick, somewhat\r\nrounded muscle, which extends between the anterior part of the sternum\r\nand the front of the arm. It forms a distinct prominence on the front of\r\nthe breast, which is easily recognized in the living animal.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The cariniform cartilage of the sternum.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The curved line of the humerus with the\r\nmastoido-humeralis; (2) the fascia of the arm.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct and advance the limb.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The belly of the muscle is convex on its superficial face,\r\nbut deeply it is flattened where it overlaps the posterior superficial\r\npectoral. Here the two muscles are usually pretty intimately attached to\r\neach other, and care must be exercised in making the separation. The\r\ntendon of insertion blends with that of the mastoido-humeralis and with\r\nthe fascia of the arm. At the middle line of the breast a furrow occurs\r\nbetween the two muscles; laterally, another furrow, containing the\r\ncephalic vein, lies between the muscle and the mastoido-humeralis.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, fascia, and panniculus; deeply,\r\nthe posterior division, the deep pectoral, and the biceps. The cephalic\r\nvein lies in the groove between this muscle and the mastoido-humeralis.\r\n\r\n(=b=) =Posterior superficial pectoral= (portio sternocostalis;\r\npectoralis transversus).—This is a wide muscular sheet which extends\r\nfrom the ventral edge of the sternum to the fascia on the inner surface\r\nof the forearm.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The ventral edge of the sternum as far back as the sixth\r\ncartilage; (2) a fibrous raphé common to the two muscles.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The fascia on the proximal third of the forearm; (2)\r\nthe curved line of the humerus with the preceding muscle.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct the limb and to tense the fascia of the forearm.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—It is thin and pale, and mixed with a good deal of fibrous\r\ntissue. The right and left muscles fuse at a median fibrous raphé. The\r\ntendon of insertion unites with the fascia on the inner side of the\r\nforearm for the most part; only a small part in front, about an inch in\r\nwidth, is attached to the humerus.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, fascia, and the preceding muscle;\r\ndeeply, the deep pectoral, the biceps, and the brachialis; at the elbow,\r\nthe posterior radial vessels, the median nerve, and the inner and middle\r\nflexors of the carpus.\r\n\r\n3. =Deep pectoral= (M. pectoralis profundus).—This muscle is much\r\nthicker and more extensive in the horse than the superficial pectoral.\r\nIt consists of two distinct portions.\r\n\r\n(=a=) =Anterior deep pectoral= (portio prescapularis; pectoralis\r\nparvus).—This division is prismatic and extends from the anterior part\r\nof the lateral surface of the sternum to the cervical angle of the\r\nscapula.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The anterior half of the lateral surface of the sternum and\r\nthe cartilages of the first four ribs.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The aponeurosis which covers the supraspinatus at its\r\ndorsal end, and the scapular fascia.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct and retract the limb; when the limb is advanced and\r\nfixed, to draw the trunk forward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is almost entirely fleshy. It describes a curve\r\n(convex anteriorly), passing at first forward, then upward over the\r\nfront of the shoulder, a little to its inner side, and finally upward\r\nand backward along the anterior border of the supraspinatus. It is\r\nloosely attached to the latter muscle, and terminates in a pointed end\r\nwhich becomes more firmly attached near the cervical angle of the\r\nscapula.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin and fascia, the panniculus,\r\nsuperficial pectoral, trapezius, and mastoido-humeralis muscles, the\r\ncephalic vein, and the inferior cervical artery; deeply, the posterior\r\ndeep pectoral, biceps, supraspinatus, omo-hyoideus, and serratus magnus\r\nmuscles, the brachial vessels, and the branches of the brachial plexus\r\nof nerves.\r\n\r\n(=b=) =Posterior deep pectoral= (portio humeralis s. ascendens;\r\npectoralis magnus).—This is much the largest of the pectoral group in\r\nthe horse. It is somewhat triangular or fan-shaped.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The abdominal tunic; (2) the xiphoid cartilage and ventral\r\naspect of the sternum; (3) the cartilages of the fourth to the ninth\r\nribs.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The internal tuberosity of the humerus; (2) the\r\nexternal lip of the bicipital groove; (3) the tendon of origin of the\r\ncoraco-brachialis.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct and retract the limb; if the limb is advanced and\r\nfixed, to draw the trunk forward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—This muscle is also almost entirely fleshy. Its posterior\r\npart is wide and thin, but as the muscle is traced forward, it becomes\r\nnarrower and much thicker. It passes forward and slightly upward in a\r\ngentle curve to its insertion. The humeral insertion is just below that\r\nof the inner division of the supraspinatus. Part of the fibers are\r\ninserted by means of a tendinous band which binds down the tendon of the\r\nbiceps and is attached to the external lip of the bicipital groove, and\r\na small part is attached to the tendon of origin of the\r\ncoraco-brachialis.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, panniculus, and superficial\r\npectoral; deeply, the abdominal tunic, the external oblique, the rectus\r\nabdominis et thoracis, the brachial vessels, and branches of the\r\nbrachial plexus of nerves. The external thoracic vein lies along the\r\nouter or upper border.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Internal and external thoracic, inferior cervical,\r\nanterior circumflex, and intercostal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Pectoral (or thoracic) nerves, from the brachial plexus.\r\n\r\n4. =Serratus magnus= (M. serratus ventralis).—This is a large,\r\nfan-shaped muscle, situated on the lateral surface of the neck and\r\nthorax. It derives its name from the serrated ventral edge of its\r\nthoracic portion. It consists of a cervical and a thoracic portion.\r\n\r\n(=a=) =Cervical part= (M. serratus cervicis; levator scapulæ hominis).\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The transverse processes of the last four or five cervical\r\nvertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The anterior triangular area on the costal surface of the\r\nscapula and the adjacent part of the cartilage.\r\n\r\n(=b=) =Thoracic part= (M. serratus thoracis; serratus anterior hominis).\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The external surfaces of the first eight or nine ribs.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The posterior triangular area on the costal surface of the\r\nscapula and the adjacent part of the cartilage.\r\n\r\n_Action._—The two muscles form a sort of sling in which the trunk is\r\nsuspended. Contracting together, they raise the thorax; contracting\r\nsingly, the weight is shifted to the limb on the side of the muscle\r\nacting. The two parts can contract separately and are antagonistic in\r\ntheir action on the scapula. The cervical part draws the base of the\r\nscapula toward the neck, while the thoracic part has the opposite\r\naction; these effects concur in the backward and forward swing of the\r\nlimb respectively. With the limb fixed, the cervical part extends\r\n(raises) the neck or inclines it laterally. The thoracic part may act as\r\na muscle of forced inspiration.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—In the domesticated animals there is no such clear division\r\nof the muscle as is found in man and the apes. On account of the\r\ndifference in action, however, it seems desirable to distinguish the two\r\nportions. The cervical part is thick and almost entirely fleshy. The\r\nthoracic part has on its superficial face a thick, tendinous layer which\r\nmay sustain the weight of the trunk when the muscle substance relaxes.\r\nThe ventral edge presents distinct digitations, the last four of which\r\nalternate with those of the obliquus externus abdominis, and are covered\r\nby the abdominal tunic. The fourth, fifth, and sixth digitations extend\r\nnearly to the distal ends of the ribs. The last digitation is small and\r\nmay be absent. Exceptionally additional digitations may be attached to\r\nthe tenth or eleventh rib or to the fascia over the intercostal muscles.\r\nThe fibers converge to the insertion, which is thick and is intersected\r\nby elastic lamellæ derived from the dorso-scapular ligament.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the mastoido-humeralis, trapezius, deep\r\npectoral, subscapularis, teres major, latissimus dorsi, panniculus\r\ncarnosus, the abdominal tunic, the brachial vessels, and the long\r\nthoracic nerve; deeply, the splenius, complexus, longissimus,\r\ntransversalis costarum, the ribs and external intercostal muscles, and\r\nbranches of the superior cervical and dorsal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Superior cervical, dorsal, vertebral, and intercostal\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Brachial plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    II. THE MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER\r\n\r\nUnder this head will be described those muscles which arise on the\r\nscapula and end on the arm; they may be divided into two groups—one\r\ncovering the dorsum, the other the venter of the scapula.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial fascia= of the shoulder and arm contains the panniculus\r\ncarnosus of this region, and may be considered to be continued on the\r\ninner side of the limb by the subscapular fascia.\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic= or =scapulo-humeral portion= of the =panniculus= (M.\r\ncutaneus scapulæ et humeri) arises by a thin aponeurosis from the\r\nligamentum nuchæ at the withers. The fleshy portion begins over the\r\nupper part of the scapula and extends to the elbow. Its fibers have in\r\ngeneral a dorso-ventral direction. It is continuous behind with the\r\nabdominal portion.\r\n\r\nThe =deep fascia= of the shoulder and arm (Fascia omobrachialis) is much\r\nmore developed and important. It is strong and tendinous, and is\r\nintimately adherent to the muscles on the outer surface of the scapula,\r\nbetween which it detaches =intermuscular septa=, which are attached to\r\nthe spine and borders of the scapula. The brachial portion is, for the\r\nmost part, only loosely attached to the underlying muscles, for which it\r\nforms sheaths; it is attached to the humerus, especially to the lips of\r\nthe bicipital groove and the deltoid tuberosity. It blends distally with\r\nthe tendon of insertion of the biceps, and is continued by the\r\nantibrachial fascia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A. EXTERNAL GROUP (Figs. 178, 179)\r\n\r\n1. =Deltoid= (M. deltoideus; long abductor of the arm; scapular portion\r\nof the deltoid of man).—This lies partly on the triceps in the angle\r\nbetween the scapula and humerus, partly on the infraspinatus and teres\r\nminor.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The upper part of the posterior border of the scapula; (2)\r\nthe spine of the scapula, by means of the strong aponeurosis which\r\ncovers the infraspinatus.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The deltoid tuberosity of the humerus.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the shoulder joint and abduct the arm.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The origin of the muscle is partly aponeurotic, partly\r\nfleshy. The aponeurosis fuses with that of the infraspinatus; the\r\nposterior part is attached to the scapula immediately in front of the\r\norigin of the long head of the triceps. The belly of the muscle lies for\r\nthe most part in a cavity formed in the triceps. It is widest about its\r\nmiddle.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, fascia, panniculus, and\r\nmastoido-humeralis; deeply, the infraspinatus, teres minor, triceps, and\r\nbrachialis muscles, and branches of the posterior circumflex artery and\r\naxillary nerve.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Subscapular artery (chiefly through the posterior\r\ncircumflex).\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Suprascapular and axillary nerves.\r\n\r\n2. =Supraspinatus.=—This muscle occupies the supraspinous fossa, which\r\nit fills, and beyond which it extends, thus coming in contact with the\r\nsubscapularis.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The supraspinous fossa, the spine, and the lower part of the\r\ncartilage of the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The inner and outer lips of the bicipital groove.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the shoulder joint. It also assists in preventing\r\ndislocation.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The surface of the muscle is covered by a strong\r\naponeurosis, from the deep face of which many fibers arise. The muscle\r\nis thin at its origin from the cartilage, but becomes considerably\r\nthicker below. At the neck of the scapula it divides into two branches,\r\nbetween which the tendon of origin of the biceps emerges. These\r\nbranches, fleshy superficially, tendinous deeply, are inserted into the\r\nlips of the bicipital groove. They are united by a fibrous membrane\r\nalready mentioned in connection with the deep pectoral muscle; some\r\nfibers are attached to this membrane and the capsule of the shoulder\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, fascia, panniculus, trapezius, and\r\nmastoido-humeralis; deeply, the scapula and its cartilage, the\r\nsubscapularis muscle, and the suprascapular vessels and nerve; in front,\r\nthe anterior deep pectoral muscle; behind, the spine of the scapula and\r\ninfraspinatus muscle.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Suprascapular and posterior circumflex arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Suprascapular nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Infraspinatus.=—This muscle occupies the greater part of the\r\ninfraspinous fossa.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The infraspinous fossa and the scapular cartilage.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The outer tuberosity of the humerus, distal to the\r\nouter insertion of the supraspinatus; (2) the posterior eminence of the\r\nouter tuberosity.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To abduct the arm and rotate it outward.[57] It also plays the\r\npart of a lateral ligament.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—This muscle is also covered by a strong aponeurosis, from\r\nwhich many fibers arise, and by means of which the deltoid is attached\r\nto the spine of the scapula. A thick tendinous layer partially divides\r\nthe muscle into two strata, and, coming to the surface at the shoulder\r\njoint, constitutes the chief means of insertion. This tendon, an inch or\r\nmore (3 cm.) in width, passes over the posterior eminence of the\r\nexternal tuberosity of the humerus; it is bound down by a fibrous sheet,\r\nand a =synovial bursa= is interposed between the tendon and the bone.\r\nWhen the long insertion is cut and reflected, the short insertion,\r\npartly tendinous, partly fleshy, is exposed.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, fascia, panniculus, trapezius, and\r\ndeltoid; deeply, the scapula and its cartilage, the shoulder joint and\r\ncapsule, the long head of the triceps, the teres minor, and the nutrient\r\nartery of the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Subscapular artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Suprascapular and axillary nerves.\r\n\r\n4. =Teres minor.=—This is a much smaller muscle than the foregoing. It\r\nlies chiefly on the triceps, under cover of the deltoid and\r\ninfraspinatus.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The rough lines on the distal and posterior part of the\r\ninfraspinous fossa; (2) a small part of the posterior border of the\r\nscapula, about its middle; (3) a tubercle near the rim of the glenoid\r\nartery.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The deltoid tuberosity and a small area just above it.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the shoulder joint and to abduct the arm; also to\r\nassist in outward rotation.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is not rounded in the horse and ox, but flat and\r\ntriangular. Its origin from the posterior border of the scapula is by\r\nmeans of an aponeurosis which also gives origin to fibers of the\r\ninfraspinatus and triceps. A =bursa= is commonly found between the\r\nterminal part of the muscle and the capsule of the shoulder joint, and\r\nis often continuous with that of the infraspinatus.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the deltoid and infraspinatus muscles;\r\ndeeply, the scapula, the shoulder joint, and the triceps muscle.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Subscapular artery (circumflex branches).\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Axillary nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           B. INTERNAL GROUP\r\n\r\n1. =Subscapularis.=—This muscle occupies the subscapular fossa, beyond\r\nwhich, however, it extends both before and behind.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The subscapular fossa.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The posterior eminence of the internal tuberosity of the\r\nhumerus.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct the humerus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 187.—MUSCLES OF THORACIC LIMB OF HORSE, INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _3_, _4_, Rhomboideus; _5_, latissimus dorsi; _8_, posterior deep\r\n    pectoral; _9_, anterior deep pectoral; _11_, supraspinatus; _15_,\r\n    subscapularis; _16_, teres major; _20_, long head of triceps; _22a_,\r\n    _22b_, tensor fasciæ antibrachii; _23_, internal head of triceps.\r\n    (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is flat and triangular, with the base upward.\r\nThe latter is thin and interdigitates with the scapular attachments of\r\nthe serratus. Below this the belly thickens and becomes narrower. It is\r\ncovered by an aponeurosis, and contains a considerable amount of\r\ntendinous tissue. The tendon of insertion is crossed by the tendon of\r\norigin of the coraco-brachialis; it is intimately adherent to the\r\ncapsule of the shoulder joint, and may be regarded as replacing the\r\ninternal ligament of the latter. A small bursa may occur here.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the scapula and shoulder joint, the\r\nsupraspinatus, triceps, and teres major muscles; deeply, the serratus\r\nmagnus muscle, the brachial vessels, and the chief branches of the\r\nbrachial plexus. The subscapular vessels run along or near the posterior\r\nedge of the muscle.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Subscapular artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Subscapular nerves (from the brachial plexus).\r\n\r\n2. =Teres major= (Teres internus; adductor of the arm).—This muscle is\r\nflat, widest about its middle, and lies chiefly on the deep face of the\r\ntriceps.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The dorsal angle and the adjacent part of the posterior border\r\nof the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The tubercle on the inner surface of the shaft of the\r\nhumerus, in common with the latissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the shoulder joint and adduct the arm.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—It is for the most part fleshy, but the origin consists of\r\nan aponeurosis which blends with that of the tensor fasciæ antibrachii.\r\nThe insertion is by a flat tendon which fuses with that of the\r\nlatissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the triceps, infraspinatus, and deltoid\r\nmuscles; deeply, the serratus magnus muscle. The subscapular vessels lie\r\nin a groove between the anterior edge of this muscle and the posterior\r\nborder of the subscapularis; near the shoulder joint the posterior\r\ncircumflex artery and the axillary nerve emerge between the two muscles.\r\nThe deep face of the muscle is crossed by the thoracic branches of the\r\nbrachial plexus, and by the branch of the subscapular artery which\r\nsupplies the latissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Subscapular artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Axillary nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Coraco-brachialis= (Coraco-humeralis).—This muscle lies on the inner\r\nsurface of the shoulder joint and the arm.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The coracoid process of the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) A small area above the internal tubercle of the\r\nhumerus; (2) the middle third of the anterior surface of the humerus.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct the arm and to flex the shoulder joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The long tendon of origin emerges between the subscapularis\r\nand the inner branch of the supraspinatus. It passes over the terminal\r\npart of the subscapularis and is provided with a =synovial sheath=. The\r\nmuscular part spreads out and divides into two portions. The smaller and\r\nshorter portion is inserted into the proximal third of the shaft of the\r\nhumerus, close to the origin of the lateral head of the triceps; the\r\nlarger and longer portion is inserted into the middle third of the\r\nhumerus, in front of the internal tubercle and the inner head of the\r\ntriceps.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Externally, the subscapularis muscle and the humerus;\r\ninternally, the deep pectoral and brachialis muscles. The anterior\r\ncircumflex artery and the nerve to the biceps usually emerge between the\r\ntwo insertions, and the brachial vessels lie along the posterior border\r\nof the muscle.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Anterior circumflex artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Musculo-cutaneous nerve.\r\n\r\n4. =Capsularis= (Scapulo-humeralis posticus s. gracilis).—This is a very\r\nsmall muscle, which lies on the back of the capsule of the shoulder\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The scapula, close to the rim of the glenoid cavity.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The posterior surface of the shaft of the humerus, a short\r\ndistance below the head.\r\n\r\n_Action._—It may perhaps tense the capsule of the shoulder joint and\r\nprevent its being pinched during flexion.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—It is fleshy and usually about the breadth of a finger. It\r\nmay, however, consist of only a few bundles of fibers; sometimes it is\r\ndouble. Its attachment to the joint capsule is slight. It passes through\r\nthe brachialis muscle to reach its insertion.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the teres minor and triceps muscles; deeply,\r\nthe teres major and subscapularis muscles, and the capsule of the joint.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Posterior circumflex artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Axillary nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      III. THE MUSCLES OF THE ARM\r\n\r\nThis group consists of five muscles which are grouped around the\r\nhumerus. They arise from the scapula and the humerus, and are inserted\r\ninto the forearm. They act on the elbow joint and the fascia of the\r\nforearm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 188.—BICEPS AND BRACHIALIS MUSCLES OF HORSE. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n1. =Biceps brachii= (Coraco-radialis; flexor brachii).—This is a strong,\r\nsomewhat rounded muscle, which lies on the anterior surface of the\r\nhumerus.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The tuberosity of the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The bicipital tuberosity of the radius; (2) the\r\ninternal lateral ligament of the elbow joint; (3) the fascia of the\r\nforearm and the tendon of the extensor carpi radialis.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the elbow joint, to fix the shoulder, elbow, and\r\ncarpus in standing, and to tense the fascia of the forearm.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is inclosed in a double sheath of fascia, which\r\nis attached to the lips of the bicipital groove and the deltoid ridge of\r\nthe humerus. The tendon of origin is moulded on the bicipital groove; it\r\nis very strong and dense and is partly cartilaginous. Its play over the\r\ngroove is facilitated by the large =bicipital bursa= (Bursa\r\nintertubercularis). The synovial membrane covers not only the deep face\r\nof the tendon, but extends somewhat over the edges to the superficial\r\nface. A well-marked tendinous intersection runs through the belly of the\r\nmuscle and divides distally into two portions. Of these, the short,\r\nthick one is inserted into the bicipital tuberosity and detaches fibers\r\nto the internal lateral ligament. The long tendon (Lacertus fibrosus) is\r\nthinner, blends with the fascia of the forearm, and ends by fusing with\r\nthe tendon of the extensor carpi radialis.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Externally, the mastoido-humeralis and brachialis muscles;\r\ninternally, the posterior deep pectoral and the superficial pectoral\r\nmuscles; in front, the anterior deep pectoral muscle; behind, the\r\nhumerus, the coraco-brachialis muscle, the anterior circumflex and\r\nanterior radial vessels, and the musculo-cutaneous nerve.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Branches of the brachial and anterior radial arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Musculo-cutaneous nerve.\r\n\r\n2. =Brachialis= (Humeralis obliquus s. externus; brachialis\r\nanticus).—This muscle occupies the musculo-spiral groove of the humerus.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The proximal third of the posterior surface of the humerus.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The inner surface of the neck of the radius (under cover of\r\nthe lateral ligament) and the arciform ligament.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the elbow joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The peculiar spiral course of this muscle gave rise to the\r\nname often applied to it—humeralis obliquus. Beginning on the posterior\r\nsurface of the shaft, close to the head of the humerus, it winds over\r\nthe lateral surface, crosses the biceps very obliquely, and finally\r\nreaches the inner side of the forearm by passing between the biceps and\r\nthe extensor carpi. It is entirely fleshy, with the exception of its\r\nrelatively slender tendon of insertion.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Externally the skin and fascia, the teres minor, deltoid,\r\ntriceps (lateral head), biceps, and mastoido-humeralis muscles. The\r\nanterior radial artery crosses the deep face of the muscle in its distal\r\nthird, and the radial nerve accompanies the muscle in the distal half of\r\nthe musculo-spiral groove.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Brachial artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Radial nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Tensor fasciæ antibrachii= (Fig. 187)[58] (Scapulo-ulnaris; long\r\nextensor of the forearm; accessory anconeus of the latissimus\r\ndorsi).—This is a thin muscle which lies on the inner surface of the\r\ntriceps.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The tendon of insertion of the latissimus dorsi and the\r\nposterior border of the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The fascia of the forearm; (2) a small eminence on the\r\nposterior border of the olecranon.\r\n\r\n_Action._—(1) To tense the fascia of the forearm and to extend the elbow\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The origin consists of a very thin aponeurosis which blends\r\nwith those of the caput longum and the latissimus dorsi. The muscular\r\nportion is quite thin in its anterior part, somewhat thicker behind, and\r\nis narrower than the aponeurotic origin. It is succeeded by an\r\naponeurotic insertion, which ends chiefly by blending with the fascia of\r\nthe forearm a little below the elbow. There is, however, a small but\r\nconstant tendinous attachment to the olecranon.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Externally, the panniculus, triceps (long and internal\r\nheads), the inner and middle flexors of the carpus, and the ulnar\r\nvessels and nerve; internally, the latissimus dorsi, serratus magnus,\r\nand posterior pectoral muscles.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Subscapular, ulnar, and deep brachial arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Radial nerve.\r\n\r\n4. =Triceps brachii= (Figs. 178, 179, 187) (Brachial triceps; triceps\r\nextensor cubiti).—This, together with the preceding muscle, constitutes\r\nthe large muscular mass which fills the angle between the posterior\r\nborder of the scapula and the humerus. It is clearly divisible into\r\nthree heads, as described below.\r\n\r\n(=a=) =Long head= (Caput longum tricipitis; anconeus longus; caput\r\nmagnum).—This, the largest and longest of the three heads, is a\r\npowerful, thick, triangular muscle, which extends from the posterior\r\nborder of the scapula to the olecranon.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The posterior border of the scapula.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The outer and posterior part of the summit of the\r\nolecranon.\r\n\r\n_Action._—(1) To extend the elbow joint; (2) to flex the shoulder joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle arises by a wide, strong aponeurosis from the\r\nposterior border of the scapula. From this the bundles of the fleshy\r\nportion converge to the short, strong tendon of insertion. A careful\r\nexamination will show that the muscle is penetrated by a tendinous\r\nintersection from which many fibers take origin obliquely. The\r\nsuperficial face is covered by an aponeurosis which is specially\r\ndeveloped at its distal part. A small =bursa= occurs under the tendon of\r\ninsertion.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Externally, the panniculus, deltoid, infraspinatus, teres\r\nminor, and the external head; internally, the tensor fasciæ antibrachii,\r\nteres major, latissimus dorsi, and posterior deep pectoral muscles, and\r\nthe subscapular vessels; in front, the brachialis, and the inner head,\r\nthe deep brachial and posterior circumflex vessels, and the axillary and\r\nradial nerves; behind, the skin and fascia.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Subscapular and deep brachial arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Radial nerve.\r\n\r\n(=b=) =External head= (Caput laterale tricipitis s. anconeus lateralis\r\ns. externus; caput medium).—This is a strong, quadrilateral muscle,\r\nwhich lies on the outer surface of the arm. Its proximal third is\r\ncovered by the deltoid and teres minor muscles; the remainder only by\r\nthe thin panniculus and the skin.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The deltoid tuberosity and the curved rough line which extends\r\nfrom it to the neck of the humerus.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) A small prominent area on the outer surface of the\r\nolecranon; (2) the tendon of the long head.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the elbow joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The origin consists of short tendinous fibers. The belly is\r\nthick, and is composed of parallel bundles which are directed obliquely\r\ndownward and backward.

FASCIÆ AND MUSCLES OF THE FOREARM AND MANUS\r\n\r\nThe forearm is covered on three sides by the muscles of this group,\r\nleaving the inner surface of the radius for the most part subcutaneous.\r\nThe extensors of the carpus and digit lie on the anterior (dorsal) and\r\nexternal part of the region, while the flexors occupy the posterior\r\n(volar) surface.\r\n\r\nThe =fascia= of the =forearm= (Fascia antibrachii) forms a very strong\r\nand complete investment for all the muscles of the region. The\r\n=superficial fascia= is thin, and disappears at the carpus by fusing\r\nwith the deep fascia. The =deep fascia= is very strong and tendinous in\r\ncharacter. It furnishes insertion at its upper and inner part to the\r\ntensor fasciæ antibrachii and posterior superficial pectoral muscles; at\r\nits upper anterior and outer part, to aponeuroses from the\r\nmastoido-humeralis and biceps. It is attached at the elbow by its deep\r\nface to the outer tuberosities of the humerus and radius, to the ulna,\r\nand to the lateral ligaments. On the inner surface of the forearm it\r\nblends with the periosteum on the subcutaneous surface of the radius. It\r\nis closely adherent to the surface of the extensor muscles, but is\r\nrather loosely attached to the flexors. From its deep face are detached\r\n=intermuscular septa=, which form sheaths for the muscles and are\r\nattached to the underlying bones. The principal septa are: (_a_) One\r\nwhich passes between the common extensor (in front) and the lateral\r\nextensor and flexor carpi externus (behind); (_b_) one between the\r\ncommon extensor and the extensor carpi radialis; (_c_) one between the\r\ninner and middle flexors of the carpus.\r\n\r\nThe =carpal fascia= (Fascia carpi) is a direct continuation of that of\r\nthe forearm. It is attached chiefly to the tuberosities at the distal\r\nend of the radius, to the accessory carpal (pisiform) bone, and to the\r\nlateral ligaments. In front it forms the so-called =anterior annular\r\nligament= (Ligamentum carpi dorsale), bridging over the grooves and\r\nbinding down the extensor tendons and their synovial sheaths. Behind it\r\nis greatly thickened and forms the =posterior annular= or =transverse\r\nligament= of the carpus (Ligamentum carpi transversum). This stretches\r\nacross from the accessory carpal bone to the internal lateral ligament\r\nand the proximal extremity of the inner metacarpal bone. It thus\r\ncompletes the carpal canal, in which lie the flexor tendons, their\r\nsynovial sheath, and the principal vessels and nerves of the region.\r\n\r\nThe =fascia= of the =metacarpus= and =digit= (Fascia metacarpea et\r\ndigitalis) is, in general, thinner than the preceding. It is attached to\r\nthe tendons, ligaments, and the exposed bony prominences—especially to\r\nthe small metacarpal bones. On the flexion surface of the fetlock joint\r\nit is much thickened by fibers passing transversely from one sesamoid\r\nbone to the other, forming an =annular ligament= which binds down the\r\nflexor tendons in the sesamoid groove or canal. Distal to this is a\r\nsecond thick quadrilateral sheet (Ligamentum vaginale) which covers and\r\nis adherent to the tendon of the flexor perforatus. It is attached on\r\neither side by two bands to the borders of the first phalanx, thus\r\nfirmly binding down the flexor tendons. A little further down a\r\ncrescentic =fibro-elastic sheet= covers the terminal expansion of the\r\ndeep flexor tendon. It is attached on either side by a strong band to\r\nthe side of the first phalanx about its middle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A. EXTENSOR DIVISION\r\n\r\n1. =Extensor carpi radialis= (M. extensor carpi radialis s. radialis\r\ndorsalis; extensor metacarpi magnus; anterior extensor of the\r\nmetacarpus).—This is the largest muscle of the extensor division, and\r\nlies on the anterior (dorsal) surface of the radius.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The external condyloid crest of the humerus; (2) the\r\ncoronoid fossa.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The tuberosity on the anterior (dorsal) surface of the\r\nproximal extremity of the large (third) metacarpal bone.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend and fix the carpal joint and to flex the elbow\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The belly of the muscle is rounded, and runs out to a point\r\nat the distal third of the forearm. The tendon, which runs nearly the\r\nwhole length of the fleshy portion, appears on the surface of the latter\r\nabout its middle; here the muscle shows a distinctly pennate\r\narrangement. The tendon passes through the middle groove at the distal\r\nextremity of the radius and over the capsule of the carpal joint, bound\r\ndown by the anterior annular ligament and invested with a =synovial\r\nsheath=. The latter begins three to four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) above\r\nthe carpus and extends almost to the insertion of the tendon. In the\r\nlower half of the forearm the deep fascia blends with the tendon, and\r\nhere the latter is joined by the long tendon of the biceps.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, fascia, and the oblique extensor;\r\ndeeply, the capsule of the elbow joint, the biceps tendon, the radius,\r\nthe carpal joint capsule, the anterior radial artery, and the radial\r\nnerve; externally, the anterior or common extensor; internally, at the\r\nelbow, the brachialis and biceps.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Anterior radial artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Radial nerve.\r\n\r\n2. =Anterior= or =common digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis\r\ncommunis; anterior extensor of the phalanges; extensor pedis).—This\r\nmuscle lies external to the foregoing, which it resembles in general\r\nform, although less bulky.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The front of the distal extremity of the humerus, just\r\nexternal to the coronoid fossa; (2) the external tuberosity on the\r\nproximal extremity of the radius, the external lateral ligament of the\r\nelbow, and the external border of the radius at the junction of its\r\nproximal and middle thirds; (3) the external surface of the shaft of the\r\nulna; (4) the fascia of the forearm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 190.—MUSCLES OF LEFT THORACIC LIMB OF HORSE, FROM ELBOW DOWNWARD,\r\n    ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Extensor carpi radialis; _g′_, superficial pectoral muscle.\r\n    (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The extensor (or pyramidal) process of the third\r\nphalanx; (2) the anterior surface of the proximal extremities of the\r\nfirst and second phalanges.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the digital and carpal joints, and to flex the elbow\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is a compound one, representing the common\r\nextensor, together with vestiges of the proper extensors of the digits.\r\nUsually at least =two heads= may be distinguished. The principal or\r\nhumeral head (Caput humerale) arises from the front of the extensor\r\nepicondyle of the humerus in common with the extensor carpi. Its belly\r\nis fusiform, and terminates in a point near the distal third of the\r\nradius. The tendon appears on the surface of the muscle about the middle\r\nof the belly, the arrangement being pennate. The tendon passes downward\r\nthrough the outer of the two large grooves on the front of the distal\r\nend of the radius, and over the capsule of the carpal joint. Passing\r\ndown over the front of the metacarpus, it inclines gradually inward,\r\nreaching the middle line of the limb near the fetlock. A little below\r\nthe middle of the first phalanx it is joined by the branches of the\r\nsuspensory ligament, and the tendon thus becomes much wider. Two\r\n=synovial membranes= facilitate the play of the tendon. The proximal one\r\nis a =sheath= which begins about three inches (ca. 7 to 8 cm.) above the\r\ncarpus, and terminates at the proximal end of the metacarpus. At the\r\nfetlock a =bursa= occurs between the tendon and the joint capsule, but\r\notherwise the two are adherent. The smaller head, arising chiefly from\r\nthe radius and ulna, is often divisible into two parts (Fig. 443). The\r\nlarger of these (Caput radiale, muscle of Phillips)[59] arises from the\r\nouter tuberosity and outer border of the radius, and from the lateral\r\nligament of the elbow joint. The flat belly is succeeded by a delicate\r\ntendon, which accompanies the principal tendon over the carpus (included\r\nin the same sheath), and then passes outward to fuse with the tendon of\r\nthe lateral extensor. Usually a slip is detached which is inserted on\r\nthe proximal extremity of the first phalanx, or ends in the fascia here.\r\nThe smaller and deeper division (Caput ulnare, muscle of Thiernesse)[60]\r\nis usually somewhat difficult to isolate. It arises from the ulna close\r\nto the interosseous space. It has a small rounded belly and is provided\r\nwith a delicate tendon which may fuse with the principal tendon or may\r\nbe inserted into the capsule and the fascia in front of the fetlock\r\njoint.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—The chief relations of the belly of the muscle are:\r\nsuperficially, the skin and fascia; deeply, the elbow joint, the radius\r\nand ulna, the extensor carpi obliquus, and the anterior radial vessels\r\nand radial nerve; in front and internally, the extensor carpi radialis;\r\nbehind, the lateral extensor and the interosseous vessels.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Radial and interosseous arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Radial nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Lateral digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis lateralis s. digiti\r\nquinti proprius; lateral extensor of the phalanges; extensor\r\nsuffraginis).—This muscle is much smaller than the preceding, behind\r\nwhich it is situated.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The external tuberosity of the radius and the lateral ligament\r\nof the elbow joint, the shaft of the ulna, the outer border of the\r\nradius, and the intermuscular septum.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—An eminence on the front of the proximal extremity of the\r\nfirst phalanx.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the digit and carpus.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is pennate, and is inclosed in a sheath formed\r\nby the deep fascia, from which many fibers arise. The belly is thin and\r\nfusiform and terminates at the lower third of the forearm. From here the\r\ntendon (at first small and round) passes downward through the groove on\r\nthe outer tuberosity of the distal end of the radius, then over the\r\ncarpus, and, gradually inclining toward the front, but not reaching the\r\nmiddle line of the limb, it passes over the metacarpus and fetlock to\r\nits insertion. Two =synovial membranes= occur in connection with the\r\ntendon. A =sheath= envelops the tendon, beginning about three inches\r\n(ca. 6 to 8 cm.) above the carpus, and reaching to the proximal end of\r\nthe metacarpus. At the fetlock a small bursa lies between the tendon and\r\nthe joint capsule, but otherwise the tendon is adherent to the capsule.\r\nThe tendon becomes flat and much larger below the carpus, having\r\nreceived the tendon of the radial head of the anterior extensor and a\r\nstrong band from the accessory carpal bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 191.—MUSCLES OF LEFT THORACIC LIMB OF HORSE FROM ELBOW DOWNWARD;\r\n    EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Extensor carpi radialis; _g_, brachialis; _g′_, anterior\r\n    superficial pectoral; _c_, anterior or common digital extensor; _e_,\r\n    flexor carpi externus.

The\r\ntendon continues the direction of the muscle, crossing obliquely over\r\nthe tendon of the extensor carpi radialis; it then occupies the oblique\r\ngroove at the distal end of the radius, and crosses the inner face of\r\nthe carpus. It is provided with a =synovial sheath=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 192.—CROSS-SECTION OF MIDDLE OF RIGHT FOREARM OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Accessory cephalic vein; _b_, cutaneous branch of median nerve;\r\n    _c_, extensor carpi obliquus; _d_, posterior radial artery; _e_,\r\n    satellite vein; _f_, median nerve; _g_, _g′_, ulnar vessels; _h_,\r\n    ulnar nerve; _i_, cephalic vein; _k_, tendon of ulnar head of deep\r\n    flexor; _l_, interosseous artery; _m_, extensor carpi radialis; _n_,\r\n    anterior digital extensor; _o_, lateral digital extensor; _p_,\r\n    flexor carpi externus; _q_, _q_, _q_, humeral heads of deep digital\r\n    flexor; _r_, radial head of same; _s_, superficial digital flexor;\r\n    _t_, flexor carpi medius; _u_, flexor carpi internus; _v_, radius;\r\n    _w_, skin; _x_, anterior radial artery.

The tendon of insertion begins\r\nnear the distal fourth of the radius. It is provided with a synovial\r\nsheath which begins two or three inches (ca. 5 to 8 cm.) above the\r\ncarpus and extends almost to the insertion of the tendon.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin and fascia, the posterior\r\nsuperficial pectoral and the tensor fasciæ antibrachii; deeply, the\r\nelbow joint, the radius, the deep flexor, the flexor carpi medius, the\r\nposterior radial vessels, and the median nerve. At the elbow the artery\r\nand nerve lie in front of the muscle, but below they dip beneath it.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Posterior radial artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Median nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  On removing the deep fascia on the inner surface of the elbow the\r\n  student may notice a small muscle lying along the lateral ligament.\r\n  This is the =pronator teres=, which is usually not present or a mere\r\n  vestige in the horse. It arises by a small, flat tendon from the\r\n  flexor epicondyle of the humerus, and is inserted into the internal\r\n  lateral ligament of the elbow. On account of its small size and the\r\n  fact that the forearm is fixed in the position of pronation, the\r\n  muscle can have no appreciable function. It is usually represented by\r\n  the long portion of the internal lateral ligament.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Flexor carpi medius= (M. flexor carpi ulnaris s. ulnaris medialis;\r\noblique or middle flexor of the metacarpus).—This muscle lies on the\r\ninner and posterior aspect of the forearm partly under, partly behind,\r\nthe preceding muscle. It arises by two heads—humeral and ulnar.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The flexor (internal) epicondyle of the humerus just\r\nbehind the preceding muscle; (2) the inner surface and posterior border\r\nof the olecranon.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The upper edge of the accessory carpal (pisiform) bone.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the carpal joint, and to extend the elbow.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The humeral head is much the larger, constituting, in fact,\r\nthe bulk of the muscle. It is flattened, curved, and tapers at both\r\nends. The ulnar head, much smaller and very thin, is covered by an\r\naponeurosis from which many of its fibers arise. It joins the large head\r\na little above the middle of the forearm. The tendon of insertion is\r\nshort and strong; it blends with the posterior annular ligament of the\r\ncarpus.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the tensor fasciæ antibrachii, superficial\r\npectoral, and flexor carpi internus, the skin and fascia, and cutaneous\r\nbranches of the ulnar nerve; deeply, the superficial and deep flexors of\r\nthe digit.

(After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The fleshy portion of the muscle or =humeral head= takes\r\norigin from the humerus. The =radial head= (Caput tendineum) consists of\r\na strong fibrous band, usually termed the =radial= or =superior check\r\nligament=, which fuses with the tendon near the carpus. The belly of the\r\nmuscle is intersected by tendinous strands, and fuses more or less with\r\nthat of the deep flexor. Near the carpus it is succeeded by a strong,\r\nthick tendon which passes down through the carpal canal, formed by the\r\nposterior ligament of the carpus, the accessory carpal bone, and the\r\nposterior annular ligament (Ligamentum carpi transversum). Here it is\r\nenveloped by a synovial sheath, in common with the deep flexor. This\r\n=carpal sheath= (Vagina carpea) begins three or four inches (8 to 10\r\ncm.) above the carpus, and extends downward nearly to the middle of the\r\nmetacarpus. Below the carpus the tendon becomes flattened and broader.\r\nNear the fetlock it forms a ring through which the tendon of the deep\r\nflexor passes (Fig. 150). Here the two tendons are bound down in the\r\nsesamoid groove by the posterior annular ligament, which fuses more or\r\nless with the superficial flexor tendon. At the distal end of the first\r\nphalanx the tendon divides into two branches which diverge to reach\r\ntheir points of insertion, and between these branches the tendon of the\r\ndeep flexor emerges (Fig. 189). A second =synovial sheath=, the\r\n=digital= or =sesamoidean= (Vagina digitalis), begins at the distal\r\nthird of the metacarpus, three to four inches (8 to 10 cm.) above the\r\nfetlock, and extends to the middle of the second phalanx.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 197.—CROSS-SECTION OF DISTAL PART OF LEFT METACARPUS OF HORSE,\r\n    JUST ABOVE SESAMOIDS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Relations._—The belly of the muscle is related superficially to the\r\nulnar head of the deep flexor, the flexor carpi medius, and, at its\r\norigin, to the ulnar vessels and nerve; deeply to the humeral head of\r\nthe deep flexor. The tendon is related superficially to the skin and\r\nfascia; deeply to the deep flexor tendon.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Posterior radial artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Median nerve.\r\n\r\n5. =Deep digital flexor= or =flexor perforans= (M. flexor digitalis\r\nprofundus; deep flexor of the phalanges).—The fleshy part of this muscle\r\nlies on the posterior surface of the radius, under cover of the\r\npreceding muscles. It is the largest muscle of the flexor group.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The flexor (internal) epicondyle of the humerus; (2) the\r\ninner surface of the olecranon; (3) the middle of the posterior surface\r\nof the radius and a small adjacent area of the ulna.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The semilunar crest of the third phalanx, and the adjacent\r\nsurface of the lateral cartilage.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the digit and carpus, and to extend the elbow.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—This muscle consists of three principal heads. The =humeral\r\nhead= (Caput humerale) constitutes the bulk of the muscle. It is marked\r\nby tendinous intersections, and is separable into three secondary heads.\r\nThe =ulnar head= (Caput ulnare, ulnaris accessorius) is much smaller,\r\nand is at first superficially situated between the outer and middle\r\nflexors of the carpus, the =radial head= (Caput radiale, radialis\r\naccessorius) is the smallest, and is not always present; it is situated\r\non the distal two-thirds of the posterior surface of the radius, under\r\nthe humeral head. Each of these heads is provided with a tendon. The\r\nprincipal tendon—that of the humeral head—begins about three or four\r\ninches (8 to 10 cm.) above the carpus. It is soon joined by the small\r\ntendon of the ulnar head, which begins about the middle of the forearm.\r\nThe tendon of the radial head fuses with the principal tendon close to\r\nthe carpus. The conjoined tendon passes downward through the carpal\r\ncanal, being included in the =carpal synovial sheath= with the\r\nsuperficial flexor tendon, as previously described. Continuing downward,\r\nit is joined about the middle of the metacarpus by a strong fibrous\r\nband, the so-called =inferior= or =subcarpal check ligament= (Caput\r\ntendineum). This is a direct continuation of the posterior ligament of\r\nthe carpus. Below this the tendon passes through the ring formed by the\r\nperforatus, then in succession over the sesamoid groove, the inferior\r\nsesamoidean ligaments, and the tendon surface of the third sesamoid, to\r\nits insertion (Figs. 150 and 151). Its terminal part is much widened.\r\nFrom the distal third of the metacarpus to the distal end of the second\r\nphalanx it is inclosed in the =digital synovial sheath= described in\r\nconnection with the perforatus. The =navicular bursa= or =bursa\r\npodotrochlearis= is found between the tendon and the third sesamoid or\r\nnavicular bone. The terminal part of the tendon is bound down by the\r\nfibrous sheet described with the fascia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 198.—DIGIT OF HORSE, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Large metacarpal bone; _2_, distal end of small metacarpal bone;\r\n    _3_, fetlock joint; _5_, first phalanx; _6_, pastern joint; _7_,\r\n    second phalanx; _8_, coffin joint; _9_, third phalanx; _11_, lateral\r\n    cartilage; _11′_, upper (subcutaneous) border of cartilage; _12_,\r\n    suspensory ligament; _13_, branch of _12_ to extensor tendon; _14_,\r\n    deep flexor tendon; _15_, superficial flexor tendon; _15′_, branch\r\n    of _15_; _16_, posterior annular ligament of fetlock; _17_, proximal\r\n    annular or vaginal ligament of digit; _18_, distal annular ligament\r\n    or reinforcing sheath of deep flexor tendon; _19_, lateral ligament\r\n    of coffin joint; _21_, tendon of common or anterior extensor; _22_,\r\n    tendon of lateral extensor; _23_, digital vein. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Relations._—The belly of the muscle is related posteriorly to the\r\nperforatus and the middle flexor of the carpus; internally, to the\r\ninternal carpal flexor, the radial check ligament, and the posterior\r\nradial vessels and median nerve; externally, to the external flexor of\r\nthe carpus; anteriorly, to the radius and ulna and branches of the\r\nposterior radial artery and median nerve. Below the carpus the tendon is\r\naccompanied by the vessels and nerves of the digit. It may also be noted\r\nthat the muscle is not entirely covered by the other flexors; it comes\r\nin contact with the skin and fascia on the postero-external aspect of\r\nthe proximal half of the forearm, and also on the outer aspect of the\r\ndistal fourth.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Posterior radial and ulnar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Median and ulnar nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           METACARPAL MUSCLES\r\n\r\nThe five muscles of this group are either reduced to vestiges or\r\nmodified greatly in structure.\r\n\r\n1, 2. =Lumbricales= (internus et externus).—These are two small muscles\r\nwhich lie on either side of the flexor tendons above the fetlock. They\r\narise from the deep flexor tendon, and are lost in the fibrous tissue\r\nwhich lies under the nodule of horn or ergot at the fetlock (Fig. 447).\r\nTheir action is inappreciable. The size of these muscles is subject to\r\nmuch variation. Often very little muscular tissue can be found, but the\r\nsmall tendon is constantly present.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Metacarpal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Median and ulnar nerves.\r\n\r\n3, 4, 5. =Interossei.=—These are three in number in the horse, and are\r\nsituated chiefly in the metacarpal groove. Two, the =internus= and\r\n=externus=, are very small muscles, each of which arises from the\r\ncorresponding small metacarpal bone near its proximal extremity, and is\r\nprovided with a delicate tendon which is usually lost in the fascia at\r\nthe fetlock (Fig. 150). They have no appreciable action. Their blood-\r\nand nerve-supply is the same as that of the preceding muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =interosseus medius= is so much modified that it is usually termed\r\nthe =suspensory=, or =superior sesamoidean ligament=. It contains little\r\nmuscular tissue, being transformed very largely into a strong tendinous\r\nband, bifurcate below, and having for its chief function the supporting\r\nof the fetlock. It has been described, in deference to common usage,\r\nwith the ligaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 FASCIÆ AND MUSCLES OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE FASCIÆ\r\n\r\nThe =iliac fascia= (Fascia iliaca) covers the ventral surface of the\r\niliacus and psoas muscles, over which it is tightly stretched (Fig.\r\n450). It is attached internally to the tendon of the psoas minor,\r\nexternally to the inguinal (Poupart’s) ligament and the external angle\r\nof the ilium. Its anterior part is thin. Posteriorly, it is in part\r\nattached to the ilium, in part becomes continuous with the pelvic\r\nfascia. It furnishes surfaces of origin for the sartorius, cremaster\r\nexternus, and transversus abdominis muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =pelvic fascia= (Fascia pelvis) lines the cavity (parietal layer)\r\nand is reflected on the viscera at the pelvic outlet (visceral layer).\r\nLaminæ are detached from it to strengthen the various peritoneal folds.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial fascia= of the =gluteal region= is continuous with the\r\naponeurosis of the panniculus. It covers and partly blends with the deep\r\nfascia. The =gluteal fascia= (Fascia glutea) covers the superficial\r\nmuscles of the region, and detaches intermuscular septa, which pass\r\nbetween the muscles. It is attached to the sacral spines, the dorsal\r\nsacro-iliac ligament, and the angles of the ilium, and is continuous in\r\nfront with the lumbo-dorsal fascia, behind with the coccygeal fascia.\r\nIts deep face gives origin to fibers of the superficial and middle\r\nglutei, the biceps femoris, and the semitendinosus, so that care is\r\nnecessary in dissecting it off these muscles. The chief =intermuscular\r\nsepta= are: (1) One which passes between the superficial gluteus and the\r\nbiceps femoris; (2) one between the biceps and semitendinosus, from\r\nwhich a lamella is detached which passes between the middle and\r\nposterior portions of the biceps and is attached to the tuber ischii;\r\n(3) one between the semitendinosus and semimembranosus, which is\r\nattached to the sacro-sciatic ligament and tuber ischii; it furnishes\r\norigin for fibers of the long head of the semimembranosus.\r\n\r\nThe =fascia lata= is continuous with the preceding, and covers the\r\nmuscles on the outer surface and front of the thigh. It is tendinous and\r\nvery strong, and for the most part easily separable from the underlying\r\nmuscles. It furnishes insertion to the tensor fasciæ latæ and to the\r\nbiceps femoris (in part), by both of which it is tensed. At the stifle\r\nit is attached to the patella and the inner and outer straight\r\nligaments. Internally it is continuous with the internal femoral fascia.\r\nIt furnishes the following =intermuscular septa=: (1) One which passes\r\nbetween the vastus externus and biceps femoris to be attached to the\r\nexternal trochanter of the femur; (2) two which pass between the three\r\nbranches of the biceps femoris; (3) a fourth between the biceps femoris\r\nand semitendinosus.\r\n\r\nThe =internal femoral fascia= (Fascia femoralis medialis) covers the\r\nsuperficial muscles on the inner surface of the thigh. At its upper part\r\nit is joined by part of the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle\r\n(Lamina femoralis) (Fig. 450). The posterior part is thin. It is\r\ncontinuous with the fascia lata in front and the crural fascia below. At\r\nthe stifle it fuses with the tendons of the sartorius and gracilis.\r\n\r\nThe =crural fascia=, or fascia of the leg (Fascia cruris), consists of\r\nthree layers. Two of these invest the entire region and may, therefore,\r\nbe termed the =common fasciæ=. The superficial layer is a continuation\r\nof the fasciæ of the thigh, while the second layer may be regarded\r\nchiefly as a continuation of the tendons of the superficial muscles of\r\nthe hip and thigh (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, tensor fasciæ latæ,\r\nsartorius, and gracilis). The two layers frequently fuse, and are\r\nattached chiefly to the patellar ligaments and the crest and internal\r\nsurface of the tibia. About the middle of the leg the two layers unite\r\nbehind the deep flexor of the digit and form a strong band which passes\r\ndownward in front of the tendons of the gastrocnemius and superficial\r\nflexor, to be attached with the latter to the anterior and inner part of\r\nthe tuber calcis. This may be regarded as an accessory or tarsal tendon\r\nof insertion of the biceps femoris and semitendinosus. The third layer\r\nforms sheaths for the muscles, furnishing origin in part to their\r\nfibers. Two important =intermuscular septa= are detached, viz.: (1) One\r\nwhich passes between the anterior and lateral digital extensors to be\r\nattached to the fibula and the external border of the tibia; (2) one\r\nbetween the lateral extensor and the deep flexor.\r\n\r\nThe =tarsal fascia= (Fascia tarsi) fuses with the ligaments and bony\r\nprominences of the region. It is strong and tendinous in front, and\r\njoins the tendon of the anterior extensor below the joint. Laterally, it\r\nis thin and fuses with the ligaments. Posteriorly, it is very thick and\r\nstrong, forming an annular ligament which stretches from the internal\r\nlateral ligament to the fibular tarsal bone and the plantar ligament.\r\nThis converts the groove at the back of the hock into a canal, in which\r\nare the deep flexor tendon with its synovial sheath and the plantar\r\nnerves. In front of the tarsus and above and below it there are three\r\n=annular ligaments= (Ligamenta transversa). The proximal one binds down\r\nthe tendons of the anterior extensor, peroneus tertius, and tibialis\r\nanterior on the distal end of the tibia. The middle one stretches from\r\nthe fibular tarsal bone to the outer tendon of the peroneus tertius,\r\nforming a loop around the tendon of the anterior extensor. The distal\r\nband stretches across the proximal extremity of the large metatarsal\r\nbone and incloses the tendons (and sheaths) of the two extensors of the\r\ndigit.\r\n\r\nThe =metatarsal= and =digital fasciæ= do not differ materially from\r\nthose of the corresponding regions of the thoracic limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MUSCLES\r\n\r\n\r\n               I. THE SUBLUMBAR MUSCLES (Figs. 450, 456)\r\n\r\nThe muscles of this group are not confined to the sublumbar region, but\r\nextend beyond it both before and behind. Their chief function is to flex\r\nthe hip joint. Two, however,—the psoas minor and the quadratus\r\nlumborum,—have not this action.\r\n\r\n1. =Psoas minor= (s. parvus).—This is a fusiform, flattened, pennate\r\nmuscle, which lies along the ventro-lateral aspect of the bodies of the\r\nlast three thoracic and the lumbar vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The bodies of the last three thoracic and first four or five\r\nlumbar vertebræ, and the vertebral ends of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\nribs.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The psoas tubercle on the shaft of the ilium.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the pelvis on the loins, or to incline it laterally.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle arises by a series of digitations which pass\r\nbackward and outward to be inserted at an acute angle on the tendon. The\r\nlatter lies along the outer border of the fleshy portion and is\r\nflattened. It appears on the surface of the muscle at the third lumbar\r\nprocess and increases gradually in width until it reaches the pelvic\r\ninlet, where it becomes narrower.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—The ventral surface of the thoracic portion of the muscle\r\nis related to the pleura, crura of the diaphragm, and sympathetic nerve.\r\nIn the abdomen, the chief ventral relations are the peritoneum, the vena\r\ncava (right side), the aorta and left kidney (left side), the\r\nsympathetic nerves, and the ureters. Dorsally, the chief relations are\r\nthe vertebræ, the psoas major, and lumbar nerves. Near its insertion the\r\ntendon is crossed internally by the external iliac artery, and\r\nexternally by the femoral nerve.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Intercostal and lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n2. =Psoas major= (s. magnus).—This is much larger than the preceding\r\nmuscle, by which it is partly covered. It is triangular, with the base\r\nanterior.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The ventral surfaces of the vertebral ends of the last two\r\nribs and the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebræ.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The internal trochanter of the femur, by a common tendon\r\nwith the iliacus.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the hip joint and to rotate the thigh outward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The origin of the muscle is fleshy, the belly being in\r\ngeneral flattened, thick in its middle, thin at its edges. The thoracic\r\nportion is small, the abdominal part much thicker and wider, extending\r\nlaterally beyond the extremities of the lumbar transverse processes.\r\nFrom the lumbo-sacral articulation it lies in a deep groove formed in\r\nthe iliacus (with which it is partly united), becomes smaller and\r\nrounded, and passes downward and backward to terminate by a strong\r\ntendon common to it and the iliacus.[62]\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Dorsally, the last two ribs and thoracic vertebræ, the\r\nlumbar vertebræ, the internal intercostals, quadratus lumborum,\r\nlongissimus dorsi, and iliacus, and the lumbar vessels and nerves;\r\nventrally, the pleura and peritoneum, the iliac fascia, inguinal\r\nligament, the diaphragm, psoas minor, and sartorius, the kidneys, the\r\nspleen, the intestine (duodenum, cæcum, etc.) and the circumflex iliac\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Lumbar and circumflex iliac arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Lumbar and femoral nerves.\r\n\r\n3. =Iliacus.=—This muscle covers the ventral surface of the ilium\r\nexternal to the sacro-iliac articulation, and extends outward beyond the\r\nexternal border of the bone, underneath the middle gluteus.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The ventral surface of the ilium external to the\r\nilio-pectineal line, the ventral sacro-iliac ligament, the wing of the\r\nsacrum, and the tendon of the psoas minor.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The internal trochanter of the femur, by a common tendon\r\nwith the psoas major.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the hip joint and to rotate the thigh outward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The belly of the muscle is so deeply grooved for the psoas\r\nmajor as to give the appearance of being completely divided into outer\r\nand inner portions. When the psoas is removed, it is seen, however, that\r\nthe two heads are not entirely separated. The outer, larger head arises\r\nfrom the wing of the ilium chiefly; the inner, smaller head arises\r\nchiefly from a small area on the shaft of the ilium, between the psoas\r\ntubercle and the depression for the inner tendon of the rectus femoris,\r\nand from the tendon of the psoas minor. The two portions inclose the\r\npsoas major in front of the hip joint.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Dorsally, the ilium, sacrum, sacro-iliac articulation, the\r\ngluteus medius, the ilio-lumbar and external circumflex vessels;\r\nventrally, the iliac fascia, inguinal ligament, the psoas major,\r\nsartorius, and abdominal muscles. At the hip joint the chief relations\r\nare: internally, the femoral vessels, the femoral nerve, and the\r\nsartorius muscle; externally, the rectus femoris and tensor fasciæ latæ;\r\nin front, the abdominal muscles; behind, the hip joint.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Lumbar, circumflex iliac, and deep femoral arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Lumbar and femoral nerves.\r\n\r\n4. =Quadratus lumborum.=—This thin muscle lies on the outer part of the\r\nventral surfaces of the lumbar transverse processes.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The ventral surface of the upper part of the last two ribs and\r\nthe lumbar transverse processes.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The ventral surface of the wing of the sacrum and the\r\nventral sacro-iliac ligament.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Acting together, to fix the last two ribs and the lumbar\r\nvertebræ; acting singly, to produce lateral flexion of the loins.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is pennate, and is curved with the convexity\r\noutward. It is thin, largely mixed with tendinous fibers, and is, in\r\ngeneral, little developed in the horse in comparison with some of the\r\nother animals (_e. g._, dog, sheep).\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Ventrally, the psoas major and the last intercostal and\r\nfirst three lumbar nerves; dorsally, the last two ribs, the lumbar\r\ntransverse processes, and the lateral branches of the lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Lumbar nerves.\r\n\r\n5. =Intertransversales lumborum= (M. intertransversarii lumborum).—These\r\nare described with the other spinal muscles. (See p. 238.)\r\n\r\n\r\n             II. THE EXTERNAL MUSCLES OF THE HIP AND THIGH\r\n\r\nUnder this head will be described the muscles of the outer surface of\r\nthe pelvis and thigh, and those which form the posterior contour of the\r\nlatter. They are given in the order in which they may be conveniently\r\nexamined.\r\n\r\n1. =Tensor fasciæ latæ= (Fig. 178).—This is the most anterior muscle of\r\nthe superficial layer. It is triangular in form, with its apex at the\r\nexternal angle of the ilium.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The external angle of the ilium.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The fascia lata, and thus indirectly to the patella, the\r\nexternal straight ligament, and the crest of the tibia.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To tense the fascia lata, flex the hip joint, and extend the\r\nstifle joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle arises by a rather small head, about two inches\r\n(ca. 5 cm.) wide, on the antero-inferior eminence of the external angle\r\nof the ilium. Below this the belly spreads out and terminates about\r\nmidway between the point of the hip and the stifle in the aponeurosis.\r\nThe belly fuses to a considerable extent with the superficial gluteus.\r\nThe aponeurosis fuses with the fascia lata, and detaches a lamina which\r\npasses with the tendon of insertion of the superficial gluteus to the\r\nexternal border of the femur.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Externally, the skin and fascia; internally, the obliquus\r\nabdominis externus, the iliacus, superficial gluteus, rectus femoris,\r\nand vastus externus, branches of the circumflex iliac, ilio-lumbar, and\r\niliaco-femoral arteries, and the anterior gluteal nerve; anteriorly, the\r\nprecrural lymph glands. A considerable quantity of connective tissue is\r\nfound between the deep face of the muscle and the abdominal wall.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Circumflex iliac, ilio-lumbar, and iliaco-femoral\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Anterior gluteal nerve.\r\n\r\n2. =Gluteus superficialis= (Figs. 178, 199) (Superficial gluteus;\r\ngluteus externus).—This muscle lies behind and partly underneath the\r\ntensor fasciæ latæ. It is triangular and consists of an anterior and a\r\nposterior head united by the gluteal fascia.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The external angle and the adjacent part of the external\r\nborder of the ilium (anterior head); (2) the gluteal fascia (posterior\r\nhead).\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The third (external) trochanter of the femur.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To abduct the limb, flex the hip joint, and tense the gluteal\r\nfascia.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The anterior head of the muscle is not completely separable\r\n(except artificially) from the tensor fasciæ latæ. The attachment to the\r\nborder of the ilium is by means of an intermuscular septum, which passes\r\nbeneath the thick outer border of the gluteus medius. The posterior head\r\narises from the deep face of the gluteal fascia, and so indirectly from\r\nthe dorsal sacro-iliac ligament. The two heads unite and terminate on a\r\nstrong flat tendon, which is inserted into the edge of the third\r\ntrochanter of the femur, beneath the biceps femoris.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, fascia, and biceps femoris;\r\ndeeply, the gluteus medius, iliacus, rectus femoris, and branches of the\r\niliaco-femoral artery; in front, the tensor fasciæ latæ; behind, the\r\nbiceps femoris.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Gluteal and iliaco-femoral arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Anterior gluteal nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Gluteus medius= (Figs. 178, 179) (Middle gluteus; gluteus\r\nmaximus).—This is a very large muscle which covers the dorsal surface of\r\nthe ilium and the greater part of the lateral wall of the pelvis, and\r\nextends forward also on the lumbar part of the longissimus.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The aponeurosis of the longissimus, as far forward as the\r\nfirst lumbar vertebra; (2) the gluteal or dorsal surface and internal\r\nand external angles of the ilium; (3) the dorsal and lateral sacro-iliac\r\nand sacro-sciatic ligaments, and the gluteal fascia.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The summit of the trochanter major of the femur; (2)\r\nthe crest below the trochanter; (3) the outer aspect of the trochanteric\r\nridge.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the hip joint and abduct the limb. By its connection\r\nwith the longissimus a muscular mass is formed which is one of the chief\r\nfactors in rearing, kicking, and propulsion.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The anterior extremity of the muscle is relatively thin,\r\nand lies in a depression on the surface of the longissimus, from the\r\nstrong aponeurosis of which the fibers take origin. The pelvic portion\r\nof the muscle is very voluminous, and forms the bulk of the muscular\r\nmass which gives the haunch its rounded contour. This part of the muscle\r\nis intersected by several tendinous sheets. One of these is particularly\r\ndistinct, and is attached to the gluteal line on the ilium. This divides\r\nthe muscle incompletely into superficial and deep strata. The\r\nsuperficial part is inserted by a strong tendon into the summit of the\r\ngreat trochanter, and by a pointed fleshy mass with a tendinous border\r\ninto the trochanteric ridge. The deep part (Gluteus accessorius) is\r\nsmaller, and arises entirely from the ilium between the gluteal line and\r\nthe external angle (Fig. 455). It has a strong flat tendon which passes\r\nover the convexity of the trochanter to be inserted into the crest below\r\nit. The convexity is covered with cartilage, and the =trochanteric\r\nbursa= (Bursa trochanterica) is interposed between the tendon and the\r\ncartilage.[63]\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, lumbo-dorsal and gluteal fasciæ,\r\nthe tensor fasciæ latæ, gluteus superficialis, and biceps femoris;\r\ndeeply, the longissimus, the ilium, sacro-iliac and sacro-sciatic\r\nligaments, the gluteus profundus, iliacus and rectus femoris, the\r\niliaco-femoral artery, the gluteal and internal pudic vessels and\r\nnerves, and the great sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Gluteal, ilio-lumbar, lumbar, and iliaco-femoral\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Gluteal nerves.\r\n\r\n4. =Gluteus profundus= (Deep gluteus; gluteus internus;\r\nscansorius).—This much smaller, quadrilateral muscle lies under the\r\nposterior part of the preceding muscle, and extends over the hip joint,\r\nfrom the superior ischiatic spine to the anterior part of the great\r\ntrochanter (Fig. 455).\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The superior ischiatic spine and the adjacent part of the\r\nshaft of the ilium.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The edge of the anterior part or convexity of the\r\ntrochanter major of the femur.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To abduct the thigh and to rotate it inward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is short and thick and contains numerous\r\ntendinous intersections. The fibers are directed almost transversely\r\noutward over the capsule of the hip joint and converge at the convexity\r\nof the trochanter.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the gluteus medius and branches of the\r\ngluteal vessels and nerves; deeply, the shaft of the ilium, the hip\r\njoint, and the rectus femoris and capsularis.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Gluteal artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Anterior gluteal nerve.\r\n\r\n5. =Biceps femoris= (Gluteo-biceps s. paramero-biceps).—This large\r\nmuscle lies behind and in part upon the superficial and middle glutei.\r\nIt extends in a curved direction from the sacral and coccygeal spines to\r\nthe outer surface of the stifle and leg (Figs. 178, 199, 200, 201, 202).\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The dorsal sacro-iliac ligament, the gluteal and coccygeal\r\nfasciæ, and the intermuscular septum between this muscle and the\r\nsemitendinosus; (2) the tuber ischii.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) A tubercle on the posterior surface of the femur near\r\nthe external trochanter; (2) the anterior surface and external straight\r\nligament of the patella; (3) the tibial crest; (4) the anterior and\r\ninternal surface of the tuber calcis.\r\n\r\n_Action._—The action is somewhat complex, because the muscle is composed\r\nof three portions, has several points of insertion, and acts on all the\r\njoints of the limb except those of the digit. The general action is to\r\nextend the limb, as in propelling the body, rearing or kicking, and to\r\nabduct it. The anterior part, by its attachment to the posterior surface\r\nof the femur and to the patella, would extend the stifle and hip joints\r\nand abduct the limb. The middle part, being inserted chiefly on the\r\ntibial crest and the external straight ligament, would extend the hip,\r\nand, with the semitendinosus, flex the stifle. The posterior part, by\r\nvirtue of its attachment to the tuber calcis, assists in extending the\r\nhock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 199.—MUSCLES OF PELVIC LIMB OF HORSE, POSTERO-EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _17_, Position of tuber ischii; _o′_, superficial gluteus; _q_, _q′_,\r\n    _q″_, biceps femoris; _r_, semitendinosus; _t_, sacro-coccygeus\r\n    lateralis; _v_, semimembranosus; _w_, gracilis; _f_, gastrocnemius.\r\n    (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. f. Künstler.)]\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle has two heads of origin:[64] The long or\r\nvertebral head arises chiefly from the dorsal and lateral sacro-iliac\r\nligaments, the coccygeal fascia, and the intermuscular septum. There is\r\noften a large =bursa= between this head and the trochanter major. The\r\nshort or ischiatic head arises by a strong tendon from the ventral spine\r\non the tuber ischii. They unite, and a short tendon is detached from the\r\ndeep face of the muscle, to be inserted into the posterior surface of\r\nthe femur near the third trochanter (Fig. 455), a =bursa= being\r\ninterposed between the tendon and the bone. The muscle then divides into\r\nthree portions, which terminate on a strong aponeurosis over the\r\njunction of the thigh and leg. The anterior branch is directed toward\r\nthe patella, the middle toward the tibial crest, while the posterior one\r\nassists in the formation of the posterior contour of the limb. The\r\naponeurosis blends with the deep layer of the fascia cruris, as already\r\ndescribed. A synovial =bursa= occurs under the patellar insertion.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin and fascia; deeply, the sacro-iliac\r\nand sacro-sciatic ligaments, the coccygeal fascia, the femur, the\r\nobturator, gemellus, quadratus femoris, adductor, semimembranosus,\r\nvastus externus, and gastrocnemius muscles, branches of the lateral\r\nsacral, gluteal, obturator, femoral and deep femoral vessels, the great\r\nsciatic, tibial, peroneal, and posterior gluteal nerves; in front, the\r\nsuperficial and middle glutei; behind and internally, the\r\nsemitendinosus.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Gluteal, obturator, and femoro-popliteal arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Posterior gluteal and great sciatic nerves.\r\n\r\n6. =Semitendinosus= (Biceps rotator tibialis).—This is a long muscle\r\nwhich extends from the first two coccygeal vertebræ to the proximal\r\nthird of the inner surface of the tibia. It lies at first behind the\r\nbiceps, then passes downward on the back of the thigh, between that\r\nmuscle and the semimembranosus (Figs. 178, 179, 199). It has two heads\r\nof origin.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The transverse processes of the first and second coccygeal\r\nvertebræ, the coccygeal fascia, and the intermuscular septum between\r\nthis muscle and the biceps femoris; (2) the ventral surface of the tuber\r\nischii.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The tibial crest; (2) the crural fascia and the tuber\r\ncalcis.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the stifle and rotate the leg inward; also to extend\r\nthe hip and hock joints, acting with the biceps and semimembranosus in\r\npropulsion of the trunk, rearing, etc.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The long or vertebral head is small at its origin, but\r\nbecomes larger by the accession of fibers arising on the intermuscular\r\nseptum. Below the tuber ischii it is joined by the short head, which\r\narises partly by fleshy fibers, partly by a common tendon with the\r\nbiceps. The muscle then passes downward on the back of the thigh, and\r\nterminates on a wide tendon on the inner surface of the proximal third\r\nof the leg. A distinct band passes forward to be inserted on the tibial\r\ncrest (a =bursa= lying between the tendon and the tibia), part fuses\r\nwith the fascia of the leg, while the remainder joins the biceps tendon\r\nand concurs in the formation of the tendinous band, which, as before\r\ndescribed, terminates on the tuber calcis (Fig. 458). A _bursa_ may\r\noccur under the long head where it passes over the tuber ischii.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Externally, the skin and fascia, the biceps, and the\r\ninternal head of the gastrocnemius; internally, the coccygeal fascia,\r\nthe sacro-sciatic ligament, the semimembranosus; anteriorly, the biceps\r\nfemoris, branches of the femoral artery, and the great sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Posterior gluteal, obturator, and femoro-popliteal\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Posterior gluteal and great sciatic nerves.\r\n\r\n7. =Semimembranosus=[65] (Figs. 179, 186, 199, 451).—This muscle lies on\r\nthe inner surface of the preceding muscle and the gastrocnemius, and has\r\ntwo heads of origin.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The posterior border of the sacro-sciatic ligament; (2)\r\nthe ventral surface of the tuber ischii.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The internal epicondyle of the femur, behind the lateral\r\nligament.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the hip joint and to adduct the limb.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The long head, small and pointed above, extends toward the\r\nroot of the tail, fusing with the sacro-sciatic ligament. Passing\r\ndownward, it becomes larger and covers in part the posterior aspect of\r\nthe tuber ischii. A =bursa= may be found here. Below this it joins the\r\nshort head, which is much larger. The large belly so formed passes\r\ndownward and forward, covered in great part by the gracilis, and\r\nterminates on a short, flat tendon of insertion at the distal end of the\r\nfemur.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—The upper part of the muscle assists in forming the lateral\r\nboundary of the pelvic outlet. It is related posteriorly and externally\r\nto the skin and fascia and the semitendinosus; internally, to the anus\r\nand its muscles, the vulva in the female, and the internal pudic artery\r\nand nerve (Figs. 452, 453). Below the pelvis the chief relations are:\r\nexternally, the semitendinosus, biceps, and gastrocnemius, branches of\r\nthe obturator, femoral, and femoro-popliteal arteries, and the great\r\nsciatic nerve and its chief branches; internally, the crus penis and\r\nischio-cavernosus muscle (in the male), and the gracilis; in front, the\r\nadductor and the femoral vessels; behind, the skin and fascia.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Obturator and femoral arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Great sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 IV. THE INTERNAL MUSCLES OF THE THIGH\r\n\r\nThe muscles of this group are arranged in three layers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FIRST LAYER\r\n\r\n1. =Sartorius= (Figs. 180, 202, 203).—This long and rather narrow muscle\r\nis the most anterior one of the first layer. It extends from the\r\nsublumbar region to the lower and inner part of the stifle.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The iliac fascia and the tendon of the psoas minor.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The internal straight ligament of the patella and the\r\nadjacent part of the tuberosity of the tibia.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the hip joint and adduct the limb.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is very thin at its origin, but becomes thicker\r\nand narrower as it passes downward and a little backward. It terminates\r\nnear the stifle joint on an aponeurosis which blends with that of the\r\ngracilis and with the fascia of the leg.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the inguinal (Poupart’s) ligament, the\r\nabdominal muscles, the skin and fascia, and the saphenous vessels and\r\nnerve; deeply, the ilio-psoas, quadriceps femoris, and adductor. It\r\nforms the anterior boundary of the femoral canal, in which the femoral\r\nartery and vein and the deep inguinal lymph glands are situated (Fig.\r\n451).\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Femoral artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Femoral and saphenous nerves.\r\n\r\n2. =Gracilis= (Figs. 186, 199, 202, 203).—This is a wide, flat,\r\nquadrilateral muscle, situated behind the sartorius, which it exceeds\r\ngreatly in extent.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The middle third of the pelvic symphysis, the prepubic tendon\r\nand pubo-femoral ligament, and the ventral surface of the pubis behind\r\nthe prepubic tendon.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The internal straight ligament of the patella, the internal\r\nsurface of the tibia in front of the lateral ligament of the stifle\r\njoint, and the fascia of the leg.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct the limb. It may also rotate it inward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle arises by a strong tendon, chiefly in common\r\nwith the opposite muscle. Its direct attachment to the ventral surface\r\nof the pelvis is not so extensive as a superficial inspection would\r\nsuggest. The origin of the muscle presents anteriorly a round\r\nperforation for the passage of the external pudic vein. The belly is\r\ncomposed of parallel bundles, and is marked by a superficial furrow\r\nwhich, however, does not indicate a muscular division. It terminates on\r\nthe inner surface of the stifle on a thin wide tendon which blends in\r\nfront with that of the sartorius, below with the crural fascia.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin and fascia, the penis or mammary\r\ngland, and the saphenous vessels and nerve; deeply, the pectineus,\r\nadductor, semimembranosus and semitendinosus, and, at the middle of the\r\nfemur, the femoral vessels; anteriorly, the sartorius. In the upper\r\nthird of the thigh the sartorius and gracilis are separated by a\r\ntriangular interval (femoral triangle), in which lie the deep inguinal\r\nlymph glands and the femoral vessels.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Femoral and deep femoral arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Obturator and saphenous nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SECOND LAYER\r\n\r\n1. =Pectineus= (Figs. 180, 451, 456).—This muscle is fusiform and\r\nextends from the anterior border of the pubis to the middle of the inner\r\nborder of the femur.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The prepubic tendon, the pubo-femoral ligament, and the\r\nanterior border of the pubis.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The middle of the internal border of the femur, near the\r\nnutrient foramen.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct the limb and flex the hip joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The belly is cylindrical and contains little fibrous\r\ntissue. Its origin is perforated by the pubo-femoral ligament, and is\r\nthus divided into two unequal parts. The large upper part arises mainly\r\nfrom the prepubic tendon—only a very small part gaining direct\r\nattachment to the pubis. The small lower part does not reach the bone.\r\nThe insertion is pointed and tendinous.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the gracilis; deeply, the femur, the vastus\r\ninternus, the terminal tendon of the psoas major and iliacus, and the\r\ndeep femoral artery; anteriorly, the sartorius, the femoral vessels, the\r\nsaphenous nerve, and the deep inguinal lymph glands; posteriorly, the\r\nadductor, obturator externus, and quadratus femoris, and the obturator\r\nnerve (anterior division).\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Femoral and deep femoral arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Femoral and obturator nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The _femoral canal_ is exposed in the dissection of the preceding\r\n  muscles (Figs. 200, 451). It is bounded anteriorly by the sartorius,\r\n  posteriorly by the pectineus, and externally by the iliacus and vastus\r\n  internus. Its internal wall is formed by the femoral fascia and the\r\n  gracilis. Its upper or abdominal opening (Lacuna vasorum) lies behind\r\n  and a little internal to the internal inguinal ring and is bounded\r\n  anteriorly by the inguinal ligament, posteriorly by the anterior\r\n  border of the pubis, and externally by the tendon of the psoas minor.\r\n  The canal terminates below at the insertion of the pectineus. It\r\n  contains the deep inguinal lymph glands, the femoral artery and vein,\r\n  and the saphenous nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Adductor=[66] (Figs. 179, 186, 451) (Great and small adductors of\r\nthe thigh).—This fleshy, prismatic muscle lies behind the pectineus and\r\nvastus internus. It extends downward and forward from the ventral\r\nsurface of the pelvis to the internal condyle of the femur.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The ventral surface of the pubis and ischium and the tendon of\r\nthe gracilis.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The posterior surface of the femur from the level of\r\nthe external trochanter to the groove for the femoral vessels; (2) the\r\ninternal epicondyle of the femur and the internal lateral ligament of\r\nthe stifle joint.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct the limb and assist in extending the hip joint. It\r\nmay also rotate the femur outward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—It is almost entirely fleshy, and is composed of parallel\r\nbundles united rather loosely. It is usually possible to separate from\r\nthe principal mass a small anterior short portion,[67] which is inserted\r\ninto the femur behind the pectineus. The principal mass[68] is\r\nperforated below its middle by the femoral vessels, and is thus divided\r\ninto two branches. The outer branch is inserted into the back of the\r\nfemur with the short portion, while the inner branch is attached to the\r\ninternal epicondyle and lateral ligament. There is often a superficial\r\nslip which reaches the internal straight patellar ligament. Some fibers\r\npass under the lateral ligament and end on the tendon of the\r\nsemimembranosus.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Internally, the gracilis, and branches of the femoral\r\nartery and of the obturator nerve; externally, the femur, the obturator\r\nexternus, quadratus femoris, biceps femoris, and gastrocnemius, and the\r\nfemoral, deep femoral, and obturator arteries; anteriorly, the\r\npectineus, vastus internus, and a large branch of the obturator nerve;\r\nposteriorly, the semimembranosus and the great sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Femoral, deep femoral, and obturator arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Obturator nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Semimembranosus.=—Described on p. 280.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THIRD LAYER\r\n\r\n1. =Quadratus femoris= (Ischio-femoralis).—This is a narrow, flat\r\nmuscle, which lies under cover of the upper part of the adductor (Figs.\r\n455, 456).\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The ventral surface of the ischium, just in front of the\r\nsemimembranosus.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—An oblique line on the posterior surface of the femur, near\r\nthe lower part of the internal trochanter.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the hip joint, and to adduct the thigh and rotate it\r\noutward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—It is composed of parallel bundles of fibers directed\r\ndownward, forward, and outward.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Internally, the adductor, semimembranosus, and the\r\nobturator vessels; externally, the obturator externus and biceps\r\nfemoris, the deep femoral artery, and the great sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Deep femoral and obturator arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Great sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\n2. =Obturator Externus= (Fig. 456).—This is a pyramidal muscle which\r\nextends across the back of the hip joint from the obturator foramen to\r\nthe trochanteric fossa.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The ventral surface of the pubis and ischium, and the margin\r\nof the obturator foramen.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The trochanteric fossa.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To adduct the thigh and to rotate it outward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—It is almost entirely fleshy, the muscle-bundles being\r\nrather loosely connected. The insertion is pointed, flattened, and\r\npartly tendinous. The origin is perforated by the obturator vessels and\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Internally, the adductor and quadratus femoris and the deep\r\nfemoral vessels; externally, the gemellus, the tendon of the obturator\r\ninternus, the biceps femoris, and the great sciatic nerve; anteriorly,\r\nthe hip joint, the pectineus, and the external pudic vein.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Deep femoral and obturator arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Obturator nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Obturator internus= (Fig. 451).—This arises by two heads within the\r\npelvic cavity, the tendon emerging through the lesser sciatic foramen.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The pelvic surface of the pubis and ischium around the\r\nobturator foramen; (2) the pelvic surface of the shaft of the ilium and\r\nthe wing of the sacrum.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The trochanteric fossa.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To rotate the femur outward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The ischio-pubic head lies on the pelvic floor and covers\r\nthe obturator foramen. It is thin and fan-shaped. The iliac head extends\r\nalong the lateral wall of the pelvis, and is pennate, with a central\r\ntendon throughout. Both terminate on a flat tendon which passes outward\r\nthrough the lesser sciatic foramen to be inserted into the trochanteric\r\nfossa. A synovial bursa facilitates the play of the tendon over the\r\nexternal border of the ischium.[69]\r\n\r\n_Relations._—The pelvic surface is covered by the pelvic fascia and the\r\nperitoneum.

ANTERIOR MUSCLES OF THE THIGH\r\n\r\nThis group consists of the sartorius, quadriceps femoris, and\r\ncapsularis.\r\n\r\n1. =Sartorius.=—This is described on p. 281.\r\n\r\n2. =Quadriceps femoris= (Figs. 179, 186, 200) (Crural triceps).—This\r\nconstitutes the large muscular mass which covers the front and sides of\r\nthe femur. It has four heads, one of which, the rectus, arises from the\r\nilium; the other three arise from the femur. All are inserted into the\r\npatella.\r\n\r\n(1) =Rectus femoris.=—This is fusiform and rounded. It arises by two\r\ntendons.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—Two depressions on the shaft of the ilium above and in front\r\nof the acetabulum.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The base and anterior surface of the patella.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the stifle joint and to flex the hip joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—It has two short strong tendons of origin; beneath the\r\nouter one is a =bursa=. The belly is rounded and rests in a groove\r\nformed by the other portions of the quadriceps. Its sides are covered by\r\na strong tendinous layer which furnishes insertion to fibers of the\r\nvasti. The tendon of insertion is formed by the fusion of these\r\ntendinous layers on the lower part of the muscle. The lower portion of\r\nthe muscle is pennate, the fibers on either side converging on the\r\ntendon at an acute angle.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Internally, the iliacus, sartorius, and vastus internus;\r\nexternally, the tensor fasciæ latæ, glutei, and vastus externus;\r\nposteriorly, the hip joint and the vastus intermedius; anteriorly, the\r\nfascia lata and the skin. The anterior femoral artery and branches of\r\nthe femoral nerve descend into the interspace between the upper part of\r\nthe rectus and the vastus internus; similarly, the iliaco-femoral artery\r\ndips in between the rectus femoris and vastus externus.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Femoral and iliaco-femoral arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Femoral nerve.\r\n\r\n(2) =Vastus externus= (s. lateralis).—This lies on the outer surface of\r\nthe thigh, extending from the great trochanter to the patella. It is\r\nthick and wide in its upper part, and becomes much thinner and narrow\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 200.—CROSS-SECTION OF MIDDLE OF RIGHT THIGH OF HORSE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The external border and surface of the femur, from the great\r\ntrochanter to the supracondyloid fossa.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The outer part of the anterior surface of the patella;\r\n(2) the tendon of the rectus femoris.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the stifle joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The fibers are directed downward and forward, many being\r\ninserted into the tendinous sheet which covers the side of the rectus. A\r\n=bursa= is often found between the distal end and the patella.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Externally, the fascia lata and skin, tensor fasciæ latæ,\r\nsuperficial gluteus, and biceps femoris; internally, the femur and\r\nfemoro-patellar joint capsule, the rectus femoris, vastus intermedius,\r\nand the iliaco-femoral artery.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Iliaco-femoral artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Femoral nerve.\r\n\r\n(3) =Vastus internus= (s. medialis).—This is smaller than the preceding\r\nmuscle, and lies in a similar position on the inner side of the thigh.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The internal surface of the femur, from the neck to the distal\r\nthird.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The upper part of the inner border of the patella and\r\nits cartilage; (2) the tendon of the rectus femoris.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the stifle joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—This is very similar to that of the vastus externus. It is,\r\nhowever, more difficult to separate from the intermedius, because many\r\nfibers of the latter arise on the tendinous sheet which covers the\r\ncontact surface of the inner vastus. Its insertion into the patella is\r\nchiefly by means of a broad strong tendon. From the deep face fleshy\r\nfibers are inserted also into the femoro-patellar capsule.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Internally, the skin and fascia lata, the iliacus,\r\nsartorius, pectineus, and adductor, the femoral vessels and saphenous\r\nnerve; externally, the femur, femoro-patellar joint capsule, rectus\r\nfemoris, and vastus intermedius, the anterior femoral artery, and\r\nbranches of the femoral nerve.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Femoral and anterior femoral arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Femoral nerve.\r\n\r\n(4) =Vastus intermedius= (Crureus).—This muscle is deeply situated on\r\nthe anterior face of the femur, and is entirely covered by the preceding\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) The anterior and external surfaces of the femur, from the\r\nproximal to the distal fourth; (2) the aponeurosis of the vastus\r\ninternus.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The base of the patella; (2) the femoro-patellar joint\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\n_Action._—(1) To extend the stifle joint; (2) to tense (raise) the\r\nfemoro-patellar capsule during extension of the joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The muscle is usually quite difficult to isolate from the\r\nother vasti, so that many since Günther have declared it an\r\nartefact.[71] It is entirely fleshy, and is small at its proximal end,\r\nbut when traced downward increases in bulk by the accession of fibers\r\narising on the femur and the tendinous covering of the vastus internus.\r\nThe terminal part is intimately adherent to the femoro-patellar joint\r\ncapsule, where the latter bulges upward above the level of the patella.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Internally, the vastus internus; externally, the vastus\r\nexternus; anteriorly, the rectus; posteriorly, the femur and\r\nfemoro-patellar capsule.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Iliaco-femoral and anterior femoral arteries.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Femoral nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The straight ligaments of the patella are to be regarded as tendons of\r\n  the quadriceps which communicate the action of the latter to the\r\n  tibia, the patella being intercalated as a sesamoid bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Capsularis= (Fig. 154) (Rectus parvus).—This is a small muscle\r\n(scarcely as large as one’s finger), which arises on the ilium\r\nimmediately above the outer tendon of the rectus femoris, and passes\r\ndown between the vastus internus and externus to be inserted into the\r\nanterior surface of the femur. It passes over the front of the hip\r\njoint, to the capsule of which some fibers are attached. Sometimes the\r\nmuscle has two distinct heads, in which case the additional head arises\r\nbetween the two tendons of origin of the rectus femoris. Its action may\r\nbe to raise the capsule during flexion of the joint.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  IV. THE MUSCLES OF THE LEG AND FOOT\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 201.—MUSCLES OF LOWER PART OF THIGH, LEG, AND FOOT OF HORSE,\r\n    EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _o′_, Fascia lata; _q_, _q′_, _q″_, biceps femoris; _r_,\r\n    semitendinosus; _21′_, external condyle of tibia. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe muscles of this region cover almost all of the tibia except its\r\ninternal face, which is largely subcutaneous. As in the forearm, the\r\nmuscles fall into two groups, an anterior or dorso-lateral, and a\r\nposterior or plantar. The muscles of the first group are extensors of\r\nthe digit and flexors of the hock, those of the second have the opposite\r\naction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A. ANTERIOR GROUP\r\n\r\n1. =Anterior= or =long digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis longus;\r\nextensor pedis; anterior extensor of the phalanges).—This muscle is\r\nsituated superficially on the antero-external aspect of the leg, and is\r\nprovided with a long tendon which passes down over the front of the\r\ntarsus, metatarsus, and digit.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The small fossa (Fossa extensoria) between the external\r\ncondyle and the trochlea of the femur.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The extensor process of the third phalanx; (2) the\r\nanterior surface of the proximal extremities of the first and second\r\nphalanges.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the digit and flex the hock. It also assists in\r\nfixing the stifle joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The origin is by means of a strong tendon in common with\r\nthe peroneus tertius, on which also many fibers arise. The common tendon\r\npasses downward in the groove between the outer condyle and the\r\ntuberosity of the tibia, where a pouch from the femoro-tibial capsule\r\ndescends four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) beneath the tendon. The\r\nbelly is fusiform and somewhat flattened. The long tendon of insertion\r\nbegins in the belly about its middle, and is clear of the fleshy part\r\nnear the tarsus. It passes downward over the front of the hock, bound\r\ndown by the three annular ligaments already described (see crural\r\nfascia), and enveloped by a =synovial sheath= which begins a little\r\nabove the level of the external malleolus, and extends nearly to the\r\njunction with the lateral extensor tendon. This union occurs usually\r\nabout a hand’s breadth below the tarsus. In the angle of union the\r\nextensor brevis also joins the principal tendon. Beyond this point the\r\narrangement is the same as in the fore limb.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin and fascia; deeply, the\r\nfemoro-tibial capsule, peroneus tertius, and tibialis anterior; behind,\r\nthe lateral extensor and the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. In\r\nfront of the tarsus the anterior tibial artery crosses the deep face of\r\nthe tendon (Fig. 460).\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Anterior tibial artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Peroneal nerve.\r\n\r\n2. =Lateral digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis lateralis;\r\nperoneus; lateral extensor of the phalanges).—This muscle lies on the\r\nouter surface of the leg, behind the preceding one.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The external lateral ligament of the stifle joint, the fibula,\r\nthe external border of the tibia, and the interosseus ligament.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The tendon of the anterior extensor, about a third of the\r\nway down the metatarsus.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To assist the anterior extensor.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The belly is fusiform, flattened, and pennate. The tendon\r\nruns through the entire length of the belly and becomes free from it at\r\nthe lower fourth of the tibia. It passes downward through the groove on\r\nthe external malleolus, bound down by an annular ligament, and,\r\ninclining forward, blends (usually) with the tendon of the anterior\r\nextensor. It is provided with a =synovial sheath=, which begins about\r\none inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.) above the external malleolus and ends about\r\none and one-half inches (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) above the junction. Sometimes\r\nthe fusion does not occur, and the tendon then passes down the\r\nmetatarsus, alongside of that of the long extensor, to lie inserted into\r\nthe first phalanx like the corresponding muscle of the thoracic limb.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Externally, the skin and fascia and the superficial\r\nperoneal nerve; internally, the tibia and fibula; anteriorly, the\r\nintermuscular septum, the long extensor, and the tibialis anterior;\r\nposteriorly, the deep flexor and the soleus.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Anterior tibial artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Peroneal nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Peroneus tertius= (Tendinous part of the flexor metatarsi; tendo\r\nfemorotarseus [Schmaltz]).—This consists in the horse of a strong tendon\r\nwhich lies between the anterior extensor and the tibialis anterior.[72]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 202.—MUSCLES OF PELVIC LIMB OF HORSE, ANTERIOR VIEW. _y_, Rectus\r\n    femoris; _20_, patella. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für\r\n    Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The fossa extensoria (between the external condyle and the\r\ntrochlea of the femur), in common with the anterior extensor.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The proximal extremities of the large (third) and\r\nexternal small (fourth) metatarsal bones, and the third tarsal bone; (2)\r\nthe fibular and fourth tarsal bones.\r\n\r\n_Action._—Mechanically to flex the hock when the stifle joint is flexed.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—This is entirely tendinous. The proximal end and the\r\nunderlying prolongation of the synovial membrane of the femoro-tibial\r\njoint have been mentioned in the description of the anterior extensor.\r\nFibers of the latter muscle and of the tibialis anterior arise on the\r\ntendon as it passes downward to the front of the hock. At the distal end\r\nof the tibia the tendon divides into two branches, between which the\r\ntendon of the tibialis anterior emerges. The anterior branch is attached\r\nto the third tarsal and third and fourth metatarsal bones, while the\r\nouter one curves outward, bifurcates, and is inserted into the fibular\r\nand fourth tarsal bones (Fig. 460).\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the anterior extensor; deeply, the tibialis\r\nanterior. The anterior tibial vessels cross the deep face of the outer\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n4. =Tibialis anterior= (Muscular portion of the flexor metatarsi).—This\r\nlies on the antero-external face of the tibia; it is wide and flattened\r\nabove, pointed below.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The external condyle and border of the tibia and a small area\r\non the external surface of the tuberosity.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—(1) The metatarsal tuberosity; (2) the first and second\r\ntarsal bones.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the hock joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The origin is fleshy, and is divided by the groove in which\r\nlie the common tendon of the long extensor and peroneus tertius and a\r\nsynovial pouch. Passing downward on the tibia, the belly is united by\r\ntendinous and fleshy fibers with the peroneus tertius, and terminates\r\nclose to the tarsus in a point on the tendon of insertion. The latter\r\nemerges between the branches of the peroneus tertius and bifurcates, the\r\nanterior branch being inserted into the metatarsal tuberosity, the inner\r\none (cunean tendon) into the fused first and second tarsal bones\r\n(cuneiform parvum). The tendon is provided with a =synovial sheath= at\r\nits emergence, and a =bursa= (cunean bursa) is interposed between the\r\ninner branch and the internal lateral ligament.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the anterior and lateral extensors, the\r\nperoneus tertius, and the deep peroneal nerve; deeply, the tibia, the\r\ndeep flexor, and the anterior tibial vessels.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Anterior tibial artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Peroneal nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           B. POSTERIOR GROUP\r\n\r\n1. =Gastrocnemius= (Figs. 179, 201, 203).—This muscle extends from the\r\nlower third of the femur to the point of the hock. It arises by two\r\nheads.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—(1) Outer head, from the external rough margin of the\r\nsupracondyloid fossa (Fossa plantaris); (2) inner head, from the\r\nsupracondyloid crest.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The posterior part of the tuber calcis.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To extend the hock.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The two bellies are thick, fusiform, and somewhat\r\nflattened. They are covered by a strong aponeurosis and contain\r\ntendinous intersections. They terminate toward the middle of the leg on\r\na common tendon (Tendo calcaneus s. Achillis), which at first lies\r\nposterior to that of the superficial flexor, but, by a twist in both,\r\ncomes to lie in front of the latter. The deep fascia blends with the\r\ntendon throughout its length, and the soleus muscle is inserted into its\r\nanterior edge. A small =bursa= (Bursa tendinis calcanei) lies in front\r\nof the insertion on the tuber calcis, and a large =bursa= is interposed\r\nbetween the two tendons from the twist downward. The superficial flexor\r\nlies between the two heads and is adherent to the outer one (Fig. 459).\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Anteriorly, the stifle joint, the superficial flexor,\r\npopliteus, deep flexor, popliteal vessels, and tibial nerve; internally\r\n(above), the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and adductor, (below) the\r\nfascia and skin; externally (above), the biceps femoris and peroneal\r\n(anterior tibial) nerve, (below) the fascia and skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 203.—MUSCLES OF LEG AND FOOT OF HORSE, INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _r′_, Tendon of semitendinosus; _w_, gracilis; _x_, sartorius; _y_,\r\n    vastus internus.

It lies\r\nimmediately under the deep fascia, on the proximal half of the outer\r\nsurface of the leg, and is directed obliquely downward and backward.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—The head of the fibula.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—The tendon of the gastrocnemius, about the middle of the\r\nleg.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To assist the gastrocnemius.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—It is a thin, fleshy band, about an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.)\r\nin width, terminating on a thin tendon which fuses with that of the\r\ngastrocnemius.[73]\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Superficially, the skin, fascia, and peroneal nerve;\r\ndeeply, the lateral extensor and deep flexor.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Posterior tibial artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Tibial nerve.\r\n\r\n3. =Superficial digital flexor= or =flexor pedis perforatus= (Figs. 199,\r\n201, 203) (M. flexor digitalis pedis sublimis; superficial flexor of the\r\nphalanges).—The proximal part of this muscle lies between and under\r\ncover of the two heads of the gastrocnemius (Fig. 459). It consists\r\nalmost entirely of a strong tendon, the belly being very little\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 204.—CROSS-SECTION OF LEFT LEG OF HORSE; SECTION IS CUT A LITTLE\r\n    ABOVE MIDDLE OF REGION.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Tibia; _b_, fibula; _c_, tibialis anterior; _d_, peroneus\r\n    tertius; _e_, anterior or long digital extensor; _f_, lateral\r\n    extensor; _g_, deep head of deep flexor (flexor hallucis longus);\r\n    _h_, inner head of deep flexor (flexor accessorius _s_, digitorum\r\n    longus); _i_, superficial head of deep flexor (tibialis posterior);\r\n    _k_, popliteus; _l_, superficial flexor tendon; _m_, gastrocnemius\r\n    tendon; _n_, soleus; _o_, skin; _p_, anterior tibial artery; _q_,\r\n    superficial peroneal nerve; _q′_, deep peroneal nerve; _r_, branch\r\n    of _q_; _s_, posterior tibial artery; _t_, cutaneous nerve; _u_,\r\n    tibial nerve; _v_, recurrent tibial vein; _w_, saphenous artery;\r\n    _x_, saphenous vein; _y_, branches of saphenous nerve.

On account of the\r\nexceedingly small amount of muscular tissue the action is to be regarded\r\nchiefly as a mechanical effect, resulting from the action of other\r\nmuscles on the stifle joint.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The origin is by means of a strong round tendon which is\r\nincompletely covered with fleshy fibers as far as the upper third of the\r\nleg. It is pretty intimately attached to the gastrocnemius, especially\r\nto the outer head. At the distal third of the tibia it winds around the\r\ninner surface of the gastrocnemius tendon, and then occupies a position\r\nbehind the latter. At the point of the hock it widens out, forming a\r\nsort of cap over the tuber calcis, detaching on either side a strong\r\nband which is inserted into the tuber calcis with the tarsal tendon of\r\nthe biceps and semitendinosus. It then passes downward over the plantar\r\n(Calcaneo-metatarsal) ligament, becomes narrower, and is arranged below\r\nas in the thoracic limb. A large synovial bursa lies under the tendon\r\nfrom the distal fourth of the tibia to the middle of the tarsus. A\r\n=subcutaneous bursa= is sometimes found on the wide part of the tendon\r\nat the point of the hook. (Either or both of these bursæ may be involved\r\nin so-called “capped hock.”)\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Posteriorly, the gastrocnemius, fascia, and skin;\r\nanteriorly, the femoro-patellar capsule, the popliteus, the deep flexor,\r\nand the popliteal vessels; internally, the tibial nerve.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Femoro-popliteal artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Tibial nerve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 205.—INJECTED SYNOVIAL SHEATHS AND BURSÆ OF TARSAL REGION OF\r\n    HORSE, INNER VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Synovial sheath of peroneus tertius and tibialis anterior; _b_,\r\n    bursa under inner (cunean) tendon of tibialis anterior; _c_,\r\n    synovial sheath of flexor longus s. accessorius; _d_, tarsal sheath\r\n    of deep flexor; _e_, _e′_, bursa under superficial flexor tendon;\r\n    _f_, _f′_, tibio-tarsal joint capsule; _1_, anterior extensor; _2_,\r\n    tibialis anterior; _2′_, inner (cunean) tendon of _2_; _3_, flexor\r\n    longus; _4_, deep digital flexor; _5_, superficial flexor tendon;\r\n    _6_, gastrocnemius tendon; _7_, tibia; _8_, tarsus; _9_, tuber\r\n    calcis; _10_, large metatarsal bone; _11_, inner small metatarsal\r\n    bone; _12_, _12′_, fascial bands.

It has a fusiform\r\nbelly, which crosses the leg obliquely and lies in a groove formed by\r\nthe other heads and the popliteus. This terminates near the lower third\r\nof the tibia on a round tendon which passes downward, partly embedded in\r\nthe internal lateral ligament of the hock, and joins the common tendon\r\nabout a third of the way down the metatarsus. In its course over the\r\ninner surface of the hock the tendon lies in a canal formed by the\r\nstrong tarsal fascia, the tibia, and the lateral ligament, and is\r\nprovided with a =synovial sheath= which extends from the distal fourth\r\nof the tibia to the junction with the principal tendon. (2) The\r\nsuperficial head (M. tibialis posterior) is only partially separable. It\r\nhas a flattened belly, terminating near the lower third of the tibia on\r\na flat tendon which soon fuses with the principal tendon. (3) The deep\r\nhead (M. flexor hallucis longus) is much the largest. It lies on the\r\nposterior surface of the tibia, from the popliteal line outward and\r\ndownward. The belly contains much tendinous tissue, and terminates\r\nbehind the distal end of the tibia on a strong round tendon. The latter\r\nreceives the tendon of the tibialis posterior, passes downward in the\r\ntarsal groove, bound down by the strong tarsal fascia (Ligamentum\r\nlaciniatum) and enveloped in a synovial sheath, receives the tendon of\r\nthe inner head below the hock, and, a little further down, the so-called\r\ncheck ligament (Caput tendineum [Schmaltz]). The =tarsal sheath= (Vagina\r\ntarsea) begins about two to three inches (ca. 5 to 7.5 cm.) above the\r\nlevel of the internal malleolus, and extends about one-fourth of the way\r\ndown the metatarsus. (Distention of the sheath, as in “thoroughpin,”\r\naffects chiefly its proximal end.) The check ligament resembles that of\r\nthe fore limb, except that it is longer and very much weaker; it may be\r\nabsent. The remainder of the tendon is arranged like that of the\r\nthoracic limb.\r\n\r\n_Relations._—Anteriorly, the tibia and fibula, the popliteus, lateral\r\nextensor, tibialis anterior, and the tibial vessels; posteriorly, the\r\ngastrocnemius, superficial flexor, and the tibial nerve; externally, the\r\nfascia, skin, and the soleus; internally, the fascia and skin.\r\n\r\n_Blood-supply._—Posterior tibial artery.\r\n\r\n_Nerve-supply._—Tibial nerve.\r\n\r\n5. =Popliteus= (Fig. 203).—This thick and triangular muscle lies on the\r\nposterior surface of the femoro-tibial articulation and the posterior\r\nsurface of the tibia above the popliteal line.\r\n\r\n_Origin._—A small depression on the external epicondyle of the femur,\r\nclose to the articular surface and under the lateral ligament.\r\n\r\n_Insertion._—A triangular area on the posterior surface of the tibia,\r\nabove and internal to the popliteal line; also the proximal half of the\r\ninner border and a narrow adjacent part of the internal surface of the\r\ntibia.\r\n\r\n_Action._—To flex the femoro-tibial joint and to rotate the leg inward.\r\n\r\n_Structure._—The strong tendon of origin lies at first under the lateral\r\nligament, and curves backward and inward over the external condyle of\r\nthe tibia and its semilunar cartilage, being invested by a reflection of\r\nthe synovial capsule of the joint (Fig. 459).

The superficial layer ends in the nostril and upper lip, the deep\r\nlayer on the accessory (lateral) nasal cartilages and on the nasal\r\nprocess of the premaxilla.\r\n\r\nThe =levator labii superioris proprius= arises on and before the facial\r\ntuberosity and terminates by several tendons in the muzzle. It passes\r\nbetween the two layers of the preceding muscle, blending in part with\r\nthe deep layer.\r\n\r\nThe =zygomaticus= is much stronger than in the horse. It arises on the\r\nmasseteric fascia, and ends chiefly in the upper lip.\r\n\r\nThe =depressor labii superioris= does not resemble the muscle of the\r\nsame name in the horse. It arises just in front of the facial\r\ntuberosity, and divides usually into two branches, which terminate in a\r\nnumber of tendons that form a network in the muzzle and upper lip.\r\n\r\nThe =incisivus inferior= is a small, rounded muscle, which arises on the\r\nbody of the mandible below the second and third incisors, and ends in\r\nthe lower lip, blending with the orbicularis.\r\n\r\nThe =depressor labii inferioris= is thin, and does not extend as far\r\nbackward as in the horse; only the anterior end is distinct from the\r\nbuccinator.\r\n\r\nThe =buccinator= shows no marked variation, but its superficial layer is\r\nwell developed.\r\n\r\nThe =dilatator naris lateralis= arises in front of the facial\r\ntuberosity, passes forward between the branches of the levator\r\nnasolabialis, and terminates in the outer wing of the nostril.\r\n\r\nThe dilatator naris transversus is replaced by the =dilatator naris\r\napicalis=, which is situated in the muzzle and joins its fellow at a\r\nmedian raphé. It arises on the border and upper surface of the body of\r\nthe premaxilla, the fibers passing obliquely upward and outward to the\r\ninner wing of the nostril.\r\n\r\nThe =dilatator naris superior= arises from the alar cartilage of the\r\nnostril and ends in the inner wing of the nostril.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 207.—MUSCLES OF HEAD OF OX, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Levator labii superioris proprius; _b_, levator nasolabialis;\r\n    _c_, trapezius; _c′_, mastoido-humeralis; _d_, _d′_,\r\n    sterno-cephalicus; _e_, omo-hyoideus; _f_, dilatator\r\n    naris lateralis; _g_, zygomaticus; _g′_, malaris; _h_,\r\n    buccinator; _i_, depressor labii inferioris; _k_, orbicularis\r\n    oris; _m_, masseter; _n_, parotido-auricularis; _o′_,\r\n    zygomatico-auricularis and scutulo-auricularis superficialis\r\n    inferior; _o″_, scutulo-auricularis superficialis superior; _o‴_,\r\n    scutulo-auricularis superficialis accessorius; _p_, _p′_,\r\n    scutularis; _u_, frontalis; _w_, mylo-hyoideus; _1_, concha; _2_,\r\n    _3_, posterior and anterior borders of _1_; _8_, scutiform\r\n    cartilage; _9_, zygomatic arch; _28′_, ramus of mandible; _37_,\r\n    external maxillary vein; _38_, jugular vein; _39_, facial vein;\r\n    _44_, parotid gland; _50_, _50′_, submaxillary gland; dotted line at\r\n    _50_ indicates position of large lymph gland, and another lies\r\n    partly under parotid gland, just in front of _44_; _58_, internal\r\n    palpebral ligament; _59_, laryngeal prominence.

The\r\ndeep muscle (Sterno-mastoideus) crosses under the preceding and\r\nends on the mastoid process, the mandible, and, in common with the\r\nrectus capitis anterior major, on the basilar process of the\r\noccipital bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 210.—SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES OF OX, AFTER REMOVAL OF PANNICULUS.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Trapezius; _b_, omo-transversarius; _c_, _c′_, mastoido-humeralis\r\n    (_c_, cleido-mastoideus; _c′_, cleido-occipitalis); _d_,\r\n    sterno-cephalicus; _e_, deltoid; _f_, long head, _f′_, external head\r\n    of triceps; _g_, superficial pectoral; _h_, posterior deep pectoral;\r\n    _i_, serratus magnus; _k_, latissimus dorsi; _l_, obliquus abdominis\r\n    externus; _l′_, aponeurosis of _l_; _m_, serratus posterior; _m′_,\r\n    lumbo-dorsal fascia; _n_, obliquus abdominis internus; _o_, tensor\r\n    fasciæ latæ; _o′_, fascia lata; _p_, gluteus medius; _q_, _q′_,\r\n    biceps femoris; _r_, semitendinosus; _s_, sacro-coccygeus superior;\r\n    _t_, sacro-coccygeus lateralis; _u_, coccygeus. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. f Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are two scaleni. The =scalenus ventralis= (s. primæ costæ) arises\r\non the first rib and ends on the transverse processes of the third to\r\nthe seventh cervical vertebræ. It is traversed by the roots of the\r\nbrachial plexus, which partially divide it into a small dorsal and a\r\nlarge ventral part. The brachial vessels lie below the latter. The\r\n=scalenus dorsalis= (s. supracostalis) arises usually on the second,\r\nthird, and fourth ribs, and ends on the transverse processes of the\r\nthird to the sixth cervical vertebræ.\r\n\r\nThe =rectus capitis anterior major= arises on the third to the sixth\r\ncervical transverse processes, and blends at its insertion with the\r\nsterno-mastoideus and the mastoid portion of the mastoido-humeralis.\r\n\r\nThe =rectus capitis anterior minor= is larger than in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =rectus capitis lateralis= and =longus colli= resemble those of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nThe =intertransversales= are large. From the sixth cervical vertebra\r\nforward they form a muscular mass (M. intertransversarius longus) which\r\nis inserted into the wing of the atlas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            B. LATERAL GROUP\r\n\r\nThe =splenius= is thin. It arises directly from the first three or four\r\nthoracic spines, and ends by a thin tendon on the occipital bone, the\r\nwing of the atlas, and the transverse process of the axis, blending with\r\nthe mastoido-humeralis, trachelo-mastoideus, and omo-transversarius. The\r\nremaining muscles present no very marked differential features.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MUSCLES OF THE THORAX\r\n\r\nThe =levatores costarum= number ten or eleven pairs.\r\n\r\nThe =diaphragm= presents several important differential features. Its\r\nslope is much steeper and its width is greater than in the horse. The\r\ncostal attachment extends almost in a straight line from the upper\r\nfourth of the last rib to the junction of the eighth rib with its\r\ncartilage, and along the latter to the sternum. The mid-line slopes from\r\nthe twelfth thoracic vertebra obliquely as far as the vena cava, beyond\r\nwhich it is almost vertical. The right crus divides into two branches,\r\nwhich circumscribe the œsophageal opening, unite below, and then spread\r\nout in the tendinous center. The left crus is small. The œsophageal\r\nopening is situated about four to five inches (10 to 12 cm.) below the\r\neighth thoracic vertebra, a little to the left of the median plane. The\r\nforamen venæ cavæ is a little more ventral and almost in the median\r\nplane. The other muscles resemble those of the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MUSCLES OF THE BACK AND LOINS\r\n\r\nThe =serratus anticus= is very thin. It is inserted on the fifth to the\r\neighth ribs. It may be reduced to two or three digitations or may be\r\nabsent. The =serratus posticus= is usually inserted on the last three or\r\nfour ribs.\r\n\r\nThe =transversalis costarum= (Iliocostalis) has a distinct lumbar\r\nportion which is attached to the lumbar transverse processes and the\r\nexternal angle of the ilium.\r\n\r\nThe =longissimus= resembles that of the horse, but it is more fleshy\r\nanteriorly, and the spinalis dorsi is clearly distinguishable from the\r\ncommon mass. In the lumbar region the tendons meet across the summits of\r\nthe spines.\r\n\r\n=Intertransversales= are present in the back, and =interspinales= in the\r\nback and loins.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MUSCLES OF THE TAIL\r\n\r\nThese resemble those of the horse; the coccygeus is, however, much more\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ABDOMINAL MUSCLES\r\n\r\nThe =obliquus abdominis externus= is somewhat thinner and has a less\r\nextensive origin, which begins at the lower part of the fifth\r\nintercostal space and ends on the last rib above its middle. The\r\ndirection of the fibers in the flank is horizontal, and they do not\r\nreach to the external angle of the ilium, nor as high as the lumbar\r\ntransverse processes. (In this region the abdominal tunic has a strong\r\nattachment to the point of the hip and the lumbo-dorsal fascia.) The\r\naponeurosis is intimately united with the abdominal tunic, and does not\r\ndetach a layer on the inner surface of the thigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 211.—DEEPER MUSCLES OF NECK, SHOULDER, AND THORAX OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _c′_, Cleido-occipitalis muscle; _d_, sterno-cephalicus; _f_, _f′_,\r\n    long and external heads of triceps; _g_, superficial pectoral\r\n    muscle; _h_, _h′_, posterior and anterior deep pectoral muscles;\r\n    _i_, _i′_, serratus magnus; _k_, latissimus dorsi; _l_, obliquus\r\n    abdominis externus; _v′_, biceps brachii; _w_, splenius; _x_,\r\n    rhomboideus; _y_, trachelo-mastoideus; _z_, supraspinatus; _z′_,\r\n    infraspinatus; _z″_, tendon of insertion of _z′_; _1′_, cartilage of\r\n    scapula; _2_, tuberosity of spine of scapula; _3_, acromion; _5_,\r\n    external tuberosity of humerus; _6_, deltoid tuberosity; _8_,\r\n    olecranon; _26_, transverse processes of cervical vertebræ; _27_,\r\n    posterior auricular muscles; _X_, wing of atlas. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =obliquus abdominis internus= is more developed and has an\r\nadditional origin from the lumbo-dorsal fascia. The aponeurosis blends\r\nwith that of the external oblique near the linea alba, and detaches a\r\nlayer which assists in the formation of the internal sheath of the\r\nrectus.\r\n\r\nThe =rectus abdominis= arises on the lateral border of the sternum as\r\nfar forward as the third costal cartilage. The two muscles are\r\nseparated, except near the pelvis, by an interval varying from two to\r\nfour inches (ca. 5 to 10 cm.), so that this part of the abdominal wall\r\nis entirely fibrous. (The umbilicus is in a transverse plane through the\r\nthird lumbar vertebra.) There are five tendinous inscriptions, on the\r\nthird of which is a foramen for the passage of the subcutaneous\r\nabdominal vein (milk vein). The prepubic tendon has, in addition to\r\nbranches inserted into the ilio-pectineal eminences, a strong attachment\r\nto the median common tendon of the adductors of the thigh, so that the\r\nabdominal wall is strongly retracted and almost vertical at its junction\r\nwith the pelvis.\r\n\r\nThe =transversus abdominis= presents no striking differential features.\r\nThe transversalis fascia is strong and distinct except over the\r\ndiaphragm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MUSCLES OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\n\r\n                   I. MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER GIRDLE\r\n\r\nThe =trapezius= is much thicker and broader than in the horse, and is\r\nundivided. It arises on the ligamentum nuchæ and supraspinous ligament,\r\nfrom the atlas to the twelfth thoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe =omo-transversarius= is a muscle (not present in the horse) which\r\narises on the wing of the atlas, and, inconstantly, the transverse\r\nprocess of the second cervical vertebra, and is inserted into the\r\nscapular spine and fascia.\r\n\r\nThe =rhomboideus= is clearly divided into cervical and dorsal portions,\r\nthe latter extending further than in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =latissimus dorsi= has a broad tendon of origin, which blends with\r\nthe lumbo-dorsal fascia; it is also attached to the eleventh and twelfth\r\nribs, the fascia over the external intercostal and oblique abdominal\r\nmuscles, and by a tendinous slip to the deep pectoral muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =mastoido-humeralis= has two distinct parts. The dorsal division (M.\r\ncleido-occipitalis) arises on the occipital bone and the ligamentum\r\nnuchæ. The ventral part (M. cleido-mastoideus) is smaller and arises by\r\na round tendon on the mastoid process and the rectus capitis anterior\r\nmajor, and by a thin tendon on the mandible. At the shoulder a small\r\nmuscle which arises on the first rib blends with the deep face of the\r\nmastoido-humeralis.[75]\r\n\r\nThe =superficial pectoral= muscle does not present any striking\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nThe =deep pectoral= arises as far forward as the second rib and is\r\nundivided. However, the scapular portion may be considered to be\r\nrepresented by a small branch extending over the lower part of the\r\nsupraspinatus. A tendon is detached from the dorsal edge, which blends\r\nwith the latissimus dorsi and coraco-brachialis.\r\n\r\nThe =serratus magnus= is clearly divided into cervical and thoracic\r\nportions. The former is large and extends from the third (or second)\r\ncervical vertebra to the fifth rib, being overlapped behind by the\r\nthoracic part. The thoracic part is relatively thin and is covered by a\r\nvery strong aponeurosis; it is attached to the fourth to the ninth ribs\r\nby six digitations, and is inserted by a flat tendon into the inner face\r\nof the dorsal angle of the scapula.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      II. MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER\r\n\r\nThe =deltoid= is clearly divided into acromial and scapular portions.\r\nThe former arises on the acromion, the latter on the posterior border of\r\nthe scapula and the aponeurotic covering of the infraspinatus. The\r\nscapular part of the muscle is largely inserted into the fascia covering\r\nthe triceps.\r\n\r\nThe =supraspinatus=, =infraspinatus=, and =teres minor= do not differ\r\nmaterially from those of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =subscapularis= consists of three portions with a common tendon of\r\ninsertion.\r\n\r\nThe =teres major= and =coraco-brachialis= resemble those of the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        III. MUSCLES OF THE ARM\r\n\r\nThe =biceps= is smaller and less tendinous, and is situated more\r\ninternally than in the horse.

MUSCLES OF THE FOREARM\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A. EXTENSOR DIVISION\r\n\r\nThe =extensor carpi radialis= is like that of the horse. There is\r\nsometimes a small muscle lying along its inner border, which may\r\nrepresent the extensores pollicis.\r\n\r\nThere are three =digital extensors=: 1. The =common= or =anterior\r\ndigital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis communis) arises by two heads\r\nfrom the extensor epicondyle and the ulna. The heads fuse about the\r\nmiddle of the forearm, and terminate soon on a tendon which passes over\r\nthe carpus and metacarpus, gradually inclining forward. At the fetlock\r\njoint it divides into two branches, which are inserted into the third\r\nphalanges. 2. The =internal digital extensor= (M. extensor digiti tertii\r\nproprius) arises on the extensor epicondyle, and is inserted by two\r\nbranches into the second and third phalanges of the inner digit. The\r\ntendon receives two reinforcing slips from the suspensory ligament. 3.\r\nThe =lateral digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis lateralis s.\r\ndigiti quarti proprius) arises from the external lateral ligament of the\r\nelbow joint, the external tuberosity of the radius, and the ulna. The\r\ntendon terminates like that of the preceding muscle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 215.—RIGHT CARPUS OF OX WITH BURSÆ AND SYNOVIAL SHEATHS INJECTED,\r\n    EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 216.—RIGHT CARPUS OF OX WITH BURSÆ AND SYNOVIAL SHEATHS INJECTED,\r\n    INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Extensor carpi radialis, with synovial sheath (_1′_) and bursa\r\n    (_1″_); _2_, extensor carpi obliquus, with synovial sheath (_2′_)\r\n    and bursa (_2″_); _3_, extensor digiti tertii proprius; _4_,\r\n    extensor digitalis communis; _3′_, common synovial sheath of _3_ and\r\n    _4_; _5_, extensor digiti quarti proprius, with synovial sheath\r\n    (_5′_); _6_, _6′_, flexor carpi externus, with bursa (_6″_); _7_,\r\n    flexor carpi internus, with synovial sheath; _8_, deep digital\r\n    flexor, with synovial sheath (_8′_); _9_, flexor carpi medius; _10_,\r\n    superficial digital flexor, with synovial sheath _10′_; _a_, radius;\r\n    _b_, carpus; _c_, metacarpus; _d_, cut edge of annular ligament.\r\n    (After Schmidtchen.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =extensor carpi obliquus= resembles that of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe extensor tendons are bound down at the carpus by an annular\r\nligament, and are furnished with synovial sheaths (Figs. 215, 216).\r\n\r\n\r\n                           B. FLEXOR DIVISION\r\n\r\nThe three =flexors of the carpus= are like those of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial digital flexor= is somewhat blended at its origin with\r\nthe middle flexor of the carpus. It divides into two bellies,\r\nsuperficial and deep, terminating on tendons at the distal part of the\r\nforearm. The superficial tendon passes over the posterior annular\r\nligament (Ligamentum carpi transversum), perforates the metacarpal\r\nfascia, and joins the deep tendon about the middle of the metacarpus.\r\nThe deep belly is connected with the deep flexor by a strong fibrous\r\nband. Its tendon passes under the annular ligament in a groove on the\r\ndeep flexor, from which it receives fibers. The conjoined tendon soon\r\nbifurcates, each branch receiving a reinforcing band from the suspensory\r\nligament, and forming near the fetlock a ring for the corresponding\r\nbranch of the deep flexor tendon. Passing under two digital annular\r\nligaments, they are inserted into the volar surfaces of the second\r\nphalanges by three slips.\r\n\r\nThe =deep digital flexor= has the same heads as in the horse, the\r\nhumeral head, as before mentioned, being connected with the deep portion\r\nof the superficial flexor. The tendon divides near the distal end of the\r\nmetacarpus into two branches which are inserted into the volar surfaces\r\nof the third phalanges.\r\n\r\nThe synovial sheaths at the carpus present the following special\r\nfeatures: One is found in connection with the tendon of the superficial\r\npart of the superficial flexor of the digits. There is a common sheath\r\nfor the tendons of the common extensor and the inner extensor.\r\n\r\nBursæ may occur under the tendons of the proper extensors of the digits\r\nat the fetlock; they are constant only in old animals (Schmidtchen). The\r\nbranches of the tendon of the common extensor are provided with synovial\r\nsheaths from their origin to the middle of the second phalanx. There are\r\ntwo digital synovial sheaths for the flexor tendons; they may\r\ncommunicate at their upper part, and extend from the distal third of the\r\nmetacarpus nearly to the distal sesamoids. Bursæ occur between the\r\nlatter and the branches of the deep flexor tendon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           METACARPAL MUSCLES\r\n\r\nThe =lumbricales= are absent, unless we regard as such the muscular\r\nbundles which arise on the deep flexor and are inserted into the\r\nsuperficial flexor tendon at the carpus.\r\n\r\nThe =interosseus medius= or suspensory ligament is somewhat more\r\nmuscular than in the horse; indeed, in the young subject it may be\r\nalmost entirely fleshy. Its arrangement is somewhat complex. Single at\r\nits origin, it detaches about the middle of the metacarpus a band which\r\njoins the tendon of the superficial flexor and concurs near the fetlock\r\nin the formation of the ring for the deep flexor tendon. A little lower\r\ndown it divides into three and then into five branches. The lateral\r\nbranches (two pairs) are attached to the corresponding sesamoids and\r\ntendons of the proper extensors, while the middle branch passes through\r\nthe sulcus at the distal end of the metacarpus and bifurcates, each\r\ndivision fusing with the tendon of the corresponding proper extensor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 217.—CROSS-SECTION OF DISTAL THIRD OF METACARPUS OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _b_, Tendon of extensor digiti tertii; _c_, tendon of common extensor;\r\n    _d_, tendon of extensor digiti quarti; _h_, interosseus medius or\r\n    suspensory ligament; _i_, tendons of digital flexors; _i′_, branch\r\n    of _h_; _12_, metacarpal bone. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für\r\n    Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the fascia on the posterior face of the\r\nmetacarpus and digit is very thick. It is continuous above with the\r\nligamentum carpi transversum, and is attached on either side to the\r\nmetacarpal bone. At the fetlock it forms the fibrous basis for the small\r\nclaws, and below this it detaches two strong bands which diverge to be\r\ninserted into the second and third phalanges, blending with the lateral\r\nligaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE MUSCLES OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\n\r\n                        I.

Its deep\r\nportion (Gluteus accessorius) is easily separable, and its strong tendon\r\nis inserted into the femur below the trochanter major, under cover of\r\nthe upper part of the vastus externus.\r\n\r\nThe =gluteus profundus= is thin, but extensive, arising as far forward\r\nas the external angle of the ilium, and from the lower part of the\r\nsacro-sciatic ligament. The fibers converge on a tendon which passes\r\nunder the upper part of the vastus externus, and is inserted into a\r\ntubercle a short distance below the great trochanter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 218.—GLUTEAL AND FEMORAL REGIONS OF OX, AFTER REMOVAL OF\r\n    SUPERFICIAL MUSCLES.\r\n\r\n  _p_, Gluteus medius; _r_, semitendinosus; _u_, coccygeus; _28_, vastus\r\n    externus; _28′_, rectus femoris; _29_, semimembranosus; _30_,\r\n    gastrocnemius; _31_, sacro-sciatic ligament; _16_, tuber coxæ; _17_,\r\n    tuber ischii; _19_, trochanter major; _20_, patella; _21′_, external\r\n    condyle of tibia.

It is divided in\r\nthe thigh into two portions, which end on a wide aponeurosis. There is\r\nno femoral attachment. A large bursa occurs between the muscle and the\r\ngreat trochanter in the adult. The part of the tendon which fuses with\r\nthe external patellar ligament presents a fibro-cartilaginous\r\nthickening, and an extensive bursa is interposed between it and the\r\nexternal condyle of the femur.\r\n\r\nThe =semitendinosus= and =semimembranosus= arise on the ischium only.\r\nThe latter has a branch attached to the internal condyle of the tibia.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   III.

The =cervical portion=\r\n(Rhomboideus cervicalis) is greatly developed, its origin extending from\r\nthe second cervical to the sixth thoracic vertebra. The =cephalic\r\nportion= (Rhomboideus capitis) arises with the splenius on the occipital\r\nbone, and is inserted with the cervical part. The =dorsal portion=\r\n(Rhomboideus thoracalis) extends as far back as the ninth or tenth\r\nthoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe =latissimus dorsi= is attached to the four ribs preceding the last.\r\nIt is inserted into the internal lip of the bicipital groove.\r\n\r\nThe =mastoido-humeralis= divides into two parts, the =cleido-mastoideus=\r\nand =cleido-occipitalis=, which arise on the mastoid process and\r\noccipital crest respectively, and unite at the fibrous vestige of the\r\nclavicle.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior superficial pectoral= is thin. The =posterior superficial\r\npectoral= is divided into parts, one of which ends on the humerus, the\r\nother on the fascia of the forearm.\r\n\r\nThe =deep pectoral= is clearly divided into two parts. The =scapular\r\nportion= resembles that of the horse, but its origin does not extend\r\nbehind the first two chondro-sternal joints. The =posterior deep\r\npectoral= is very long.\r\n\r\nThe cervical portion of the =serratus magnus= is greatly developed, its\r\norigin extending from the wing of the atlas to the upper part of the\r\nfifth rib, and passing under the thoracic portion; the latter resembles\r\nthat of the ox.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MUSCLES OF THE SHOULDER\r\n\r\nThe =deltoid= is undivided; it arises from the aponeurosis covering the\r\ninfraspinatus, and it ends largely on the deltoid ridge, but partly on\r\nthe fascia of the arm.\r\n\r\nThe =supraspinatus= is large; it ends chiefly on the external tuberosity\r\nof the humerus.\r\n\r\nThe =infraspinatus= is inserted into a depression below the posterior\r\ndivision of the external tuberosity.\r\n\r\nThe =teres minor= is well developed; it ends on a tubercle between the\r\nexternal and deltoid tuberosities of the humerus.\r\n\r\nThe =subscapularis= and =teres major= have no remarkable features.\r\n\r\nThe =coraco-brachialis= is short and undivided.\r\n\r\nThe =capsularis= is very small and frequently absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MUSCLES OF THE ARM\r\n\r\nThe =biceps brachii= is fusiform and not greatly developed.

The =common= or =anterior digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis\r\ncommunis) arises on the extensor epicondyle of the humerus and the\r\nlateral ligament of the elbow, and divides into three parts. The tendon\r\nof the =inner part= divides into two branches which end on the =second=\r\nand =third digits=; the tendon to the second digit is small and often\r\nabsent. The tendon of the =middle part= divides lower down into two\r\nbranches for the =third= and =fourth= (chief) =digits=; above this\r\nbifurcation it detaches a small branch to the =second digit=, which\r\nusually unites with the tendon of the extensor indicis.

The =lateral digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis lateralis)\r\nconsists of two distinct parts: (1) The large =dorsal= (anterior)\r\n=muscle= (M. extensor digiti quarti proprius) has a long tendon which\r\nends on the =fourth digit=, and often sends a slip to the fifth digit.\r\n(2) The small =volar= (posterior) =muscle= (M. extensor digiti quinti\r\nproprius) ends by a long tendon on the lateral aspect of the =fifth\r\ndigit=.\r\n\r\nThe =supinator= has been found by Arloing and Lesbre, but is usually\r\nabsent in the pig.\r\n\r\nThe =pronator teres= is a small muscle which lies on the internal\r\nlateral ligament of the elbow. It arises from the internal epicondyle of\r\nthe humerus, and reaches about to the middle of the inner border of the\r\nradius.\r\n\r\nThe =flexor carpi internus= is well developed. It arises on the flexor\r\nepicondyle of the humerus, and is inserted into the third metacarpal\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nThe =flexor carpi medius= is narrow and has no ulnar head.\r\n\r\nThe =flexor carpi externus= (M. extensor carpi ulnaris) is covered by a\r\nthick, tendinous band, which extends from the extensor epicondyle to the\r\naccessory carpal bone and outer aspect of the carpus. The tendon of the\r\nmuscle perforates this band in the distal part of the forearm and ends\r\non the proximal end of the fifth metacarpal bone.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial digital flexor= has two bellies. The tendon of the\r\n=superficial head= passes down behind the posterior annular ligament of\r\nthe carpus (bound down by a special annular ligament), forms a ring at\r\nthe fetlock for a tendon of the deep flexor, and ends by two branches on\r\nthe second phalanx of the =fourth digit=. The tendon of the =deep head=,\r\nafter detaching a slip to the tendon of the deep flexor, passes down\r\nwith the latter (for which it forms a ring), and ends on the =third\r\ndigit=.\r\n\r\nThe =deep digital flexor= has three heads—humeral, ulnar, and radial.\r\nThe common tendon divides into four branches, the larger central pair\r\nending on the third phalanges of the principal digits, the smaller pair\r\non the accessory digits. The latter are bound down by a peculiar spiral\r\nband.

The tendon of origin is round, and\r\npasses through the capsule of the shoulder joint. The tendon of\r\ninsertion is bifid, one branch being attached to the ulnar, the other to\r\nthe radial tuberosity.\r\n\r\nThe =brachialis= is very little curved, and is inserted chiefly into the\r\ntuberosity and inner border of the ulna.\r\n\r\nThe =tensor fasciæ antibrachii= is thin and narrow. It arises on the\r\nouter surface of the latissimus dorsi, and ends on the olecranon and the\r\nfascia of the forearm.\r\n\r\nThe =triceps= has an additional deep head (Caput accessorium), which\r\narises just below the head of the humerus.\r\n\r\nThe =brachio-radialis= is a long, narrow, delicate muscle, situated\r\nsuperficially on the anterior surface of the forearm. It arises with the\r\nextensor carpi on the crest above the extensor epicondyle of the\r\nhumerus, and is inserted into the distal part of the inner border of the\r\nradius. It is often much reduced, and is sometimes absent. It rotates\r\nthe forearm and paw outward.\r\n\r\nThe =extensor carpi= divides into two parts. The larger outer part, the\r\n=extensor carpi radialis brevis=, ends on the proximal end of the third\r\nmetacarpal bone. The inner and more superficial part, the =extensor\r\ncarpi radialis longus=, ends on the second metacarpal bone. (A tendon to\r\nthe fourth metacarpal may occur.)\r\n\r\nThe =extensor carpi obliquus= or =abductor pollicis longus= arises from\r\nthe outer border and anterior surface of the ulna, the interosseous\r\nligament, and the outer border of the radius. It is inserted into the\r\nfirst metacarpal bone by a tendon which contains a small (sesamoid?)\r\nbone. It abducts the first digit.\r\n\r\nThere are three (or four) =extensors of the digits=.\r\n\r\n1. The =common digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis communis) arises\r\non the extensor epicondyle of the humerus and the lateral ligament of\r\nthe elbow joint. It has four bellies, each terminating in a tendon.\r\nThese are inserted into the third phalanges of the second, third,\r\nfourth, and fifth digits.\r\n\r\n2. The =extensor of the first and second digits= (M. extensor pollicis\r\nlongus et extensor indicis proprius) is small, and is covered by the\r\ncommon and lateral extensors. It arises on the proximal part of the\r\nulna. Its tendon passes down with that of the common extensor and\r\ndivides into two branches. The delicate inner branch ends on the first\r\ndigit, while the other blends with the tendon of the common extensor for\r\nthe second digit.\r\n\r\n3. The =lateral digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis lateralis)\r\nconsists of two muscles which are not rarely fused. They arise on the\r\nextensor epicondyle of the humerus and the lateral ligament of the elbow\r\njoint. The larger, =superficial belly= (M. extensor digiti tertii et\r\nquarti) terminates on a tendon which divides at or near the carpus into\r\ntwo branches, which are inserted into the third phalanges of the third\r\nand fourth digits, blending with the corresponding tendons of the common\r\nextensor. The =posterior belly= (M. extensor digiti quinti) terminates\r\nby a tendon which fuses with that of the common extensor for the fifth\r\ndigit.\r\n\r\nThe =ulnaris lateralis= or =extensor carpi ulnaris= corresponds to the\r\nflexor carpi externus of the horse, but is an extensor of the carpus. It\r\nis a large flat muscle which lies on the outer surface of the ulna. It\r\narises on the extensor epicondyle of the humerus, and is inserted into\r\nthe proximal end of the fifth metacarpal and the accessory carpal bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 234.—VOLAR MUSCLES OF FORE PAW OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Abductor pollicis brevis et opponens pollicis; _b_, flexor\r\n    pollicis brevis; _c_, adductor pollicis; _d_, adductor digiti\r\n    secundi; _e_, adductor digiti quinti; _f_, flexor digiti quinti\r\n    brevis; _g_, abductor digiti quinti; _h_, interossei; _1_,\r\n    accessory carpal bone; _2_, first digit; _3–6_, sesamoids of\r\n    metacarpo-phalangeal joints.

The larger, =humeral head= arises on the\r\nflexor epicondyle, while the smaller, superficial =ulnar head= arises on\r\nthe posterior border of the ulna. The tendons of the two end together on\r\nthe accessory carpal bone.\r\n\r\nThe =radialis volaris= or =flexor carpi internus= (s. radialis) arises\r\non the flexor epicondyle of the humerus and is inserted by a bifid\r\ntendon into the second and third metacarpal bones.\r\n\r\nThe tendons of the foregoing muscles are provided with synovial sheaths\r\nat the carpus.\r\n\r\nThe =pronator teres= is a round muscle, which is situated superficially\r\non the inner border of the proximal part of the radius. It arises on the\r\nflexor epicondyle of the humerus, and is inserted into the internal\r\nborder of the radius. Its action is to flex the elbow and rotate the\r\nforearm inward.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial digital flexor= is situated superficially on the\r\nposterior and inner surfaces of the forearm. It arises on the flexor\r\nepicondyle of the humerus and terminates near the carpus on a tendon\r\nwhich passes downward outside of the carpal canal and receives below the\r\ncarpus two reinforcing bands, one from the accessory carpal, the other\r\nfrom the sesamoid bone at the inner side of the carpus. Below this it\r\ndivides into four branches, which are inserted into the second phalanges\r\nof the second, third, fourth, and fifth digits.\r\n\r\nThe =deep digital flexor= has =humeral=, =ulnar=, and =radial heads=,\r\nthe latter arising from the inner border of the radius. They unite on a\r\ncommon tendon which passes down through the carpal canal, gives off a\r\nbranch to the first digit, and divides into four branches. These\r\nperforate the tendons of the superficial flexor and are inserted into\r\nthe third phalanges of the second to the fifth digits. The tendons are\r\nprovided with synovial sheaths from the middle of the metacarpus\r\ndownward, and are held in place by three digital annular ligaments.\r\n\r\nThe =palmaris longus accessorius= (?) is a small muscle which arises\r\nfrom the deep flexor below the middle of the forearm and ends by two\r\ntendons which unite with those of the superficial flexor for the third\r\nand fourth digits.\r\n\r\nThe =supinator= is a short, wide muscle which arises on the humerus\r\nbeneath the external lateral ligament, crosses the anterior surface of\r\nthe radius, and is inserted into the inner border of the radius. (A\r\npouch of the capsule of the elbow joint lies under the tendon of\r\norigin.) Its action is to rotate the forearm outward (supination).\r\n\r\nThe =pronator quadratus= consists of fibers which cross the inner\r\nsurface of the interosseous ligament of the forearm, except at the two\r\nextremities of the latter. It is attached to the inner border of the\r\nulna and the anterior surface of the radius. It rotates the forearm\r\ninward (pronation).\r\n\r\nThe =palmaris brevis= (?) is a very small muscle, which arises on the\r\ntendon of the superficial digital flexor for the fifth digit, and is\r\ninserted at the fifth metacarpo-phalangeal joint into the sheath and\r\nannular ligament of the deep flexor.\r\n\r\nThe =lumbricales= are three very delicate muscles, which arise on the\r\ntendons of the deep flexor, and are inserted into the first phalanges of\r\nthe third, fourth, and fifth digits.\r\n\r\nThe =abductor pollicis brevis et opponens pollicis=, a very small pale\r\nmuscle, arises on the fibrous band which connects the superficial flexor\r\ntendon with the inner carpal sesamoid, and ends on the distal end of the\r\nfirst metacarpal bone and the first phalanx of the first digit. It\r\nabducts the first digit.[76]\r\n\r\nThe =flexor pollicis brevis= arises on the posterior carpal ligament\r\nover the second metacarpal bone, and ends on the volar sesamoid of the\r\nfirst digit.\r\n\r\nThe =adductor pollicis=, situated externally to the preceding, is the\r\nlargest of the thumb muscles. It arises between the preceding and the\r\nsecond interosseous muscle, and is inserted into the first phalanx of\r\nthe first digit.\r\n\r\nThe =adductor digiti secundi= is situated between the second\r\ninterosseous muscle and the adductor digiti quinti. It arises on the\r\ncarpal ligament, and ends on the first phalanx of the second digit.\r\n\r\nThe =adductor digiti quinti= arises close to the preceding muscle, and\r\npasses outward to end on the first phalanx of the fifth digit.\r\n\r\nThe =flexor digiti quinti= arises on the ligament connecting the\r\naccessory carpal to the third and fourth metacarpal bones, crosses the\r\ncorresponding interosseous muscle, and ends on the fifth digit with the\r\nnext muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =abductor digiti quinti= is larger than the two preceding muscles;\r\nit arises on the accessory carpal bone, and ends on the outer sesamoid\r\nof the fifth digit and on the lateral ligament.\r\n\r\nThere are four =interossei= which lie on the volar (posterior) surface\r\nof the metacarpus. They are well developed and fleshy. They arise on the\r\ndistal row of the carpus and on the proximal ends of the metacarpals.\r\nEach divides distally into two branches, which are inserted by small\r\ntendons on the corresponding sesamoid bones, and detach slips to the\r\nextensor tendons.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MUSCLES OF THE NECK\r\n\r\nThe =sterno-cephalicus= is well developed.

Anteriorly it\r\nblends with the preceding muscle, while posteriorly it divides into two\r\nparts. The upper part is inserted on the third and fourth ribs, the\r\n=lower part= by a long, thin tendon on the eighth rib.\r\n\r\nThe =longus colli= resembles that of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =rectus capitis anterior major= arises on the transverse processes\r\nof the second to the sixth cervical vertebræ and ends as in the horse.\r\nThe =rectus minor= and =lateralis= resemble those of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =intertransversales= resemble those of the ox.\r\n\r\nThe =splenius= is strong and extensive. It arises on the first four or\r\nfive thoracic spines and the median raphé of the neck, and is inserted\r\ninto the occipital crest and mastoid process.\r\n\r\nThe =complexus= is composed of two parts—the biventer cervicis and the\r\ncomplexus major proper. The =biventer cervicis= arises from the\r\ntransverse processes of the fifth and sixth, and the spines of the\r\nsecond to the fifth (or sixth) thoracic vertebræ, from the ligamentum\r\nnuchæ, and the median raphé. It has four tendinous intersections. The\r\n=complexus major= arises on the transverse processes of the first three\r\nor four thoracic vertebræ and the articular processes of the last five\r\ncervical. Both end on a strong common tendon which is inserted into the\r\noccipital crest and the depression below it.\r\n\r\nThe =trachelo-mastoideus= consists of two unequal portions. The large\r\n=dorsal part= (M. longissimus capitis) arises on the transverse\r\nprocesses of the first four thoracic and the articular process of the\r\nlast three or four cervical vertebræ, and ends with the splenius on the\r\nmastoid process of the temporal bone. The small =ventral part= (M.\r\nlongissimus atlantis) arises on the articular processes of the third,\r\nfourth, and fifth cervical vertebræ, and ends on the wing of the atlas.\r\n\r\nThe other muscles present no striking differential features, but it may\r\nbe noted that distinct =interspinales= are present.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MUSCLES OF THE THORAX\r\n\r\nThere are twelve pairs of =levatores costarum=.\r\n\r\nThe =external intercostals= do not occupy the spaces between the costal\r\ncartilages.\r\n\r\nThe =diaphragm= has a small tendinous center.

It is well developed. The =serratus posticus=—much\r\nweaker—arises on the lumbo-dorsal fascia, and is inserted into the last\r\nthree or four ribs. Thus one or two ribs intervene between the two.\r\n\r\nThe =transversalis costarum= (Iliocostalis) is well developed, and\r\nextends from the ilium to the sixth, fifth, or fourth cervical vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe =longissimus= resembles that of the other animals, but the spinalis\r\net semispinalis separates clearly at the sixth or seventh thoracic\r\nvertebra. It is inserted into the articular and spinous processes of the\r\nlast six cervical vertebræ. It has no depression in the lumbar region\r\nfor the gluteus medius.\r\n\r\nThe =intertransversales= are fleshy, as in the ox.\r\n\r\nThe =interspinales= are distinct, especially in the lumbar region.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MUSCLES OF THE TAIL\r\n\r\nThese present the same general arrangement as in the horse. The\r\n=sacro-coccygei=, however, arise on the lumbar vertebræ also, and the\r\n=coccygeus= on the ischiatic spine. There is found a =sacro-coccygeus\r\naccessorius=, which arises on the internal border of the ilium, the edge\r\nof the sacrum, and the transverse processes of the first coccygeal\r\nvertebræ, and is inserted between the superior and lateral\r\nsacro-coccygei.

The fibers have an almost vertical\r\ndirection, and there is a fleshy attachment to the last rib.\r\n\r\nThe =rectus abdominis= is attached by a long tendon on the first five or\r\nsix costal cartilages, and by fleshy fibers on the xiphoid cartilage. It\r\nhas three to six indistinct tendinous inscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe =transversus abdominis= presents no special features except that the\r\nposterior part of its aponeurosis splits into two layers which include\r\nthe rectus between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MUSCLES OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 235.—MUSCLES OF TAIL, ANUS, AND GENITAL ORGANS OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Ilium; _2_, femur; _3_, tuber ischii; _4_, sacro-sciatic lig.;\r\n    _5_, sacral region; _6_, tail; _7_, penis; _8_, anus; _9_, rectum;\r\n    _a_, sacro-coccygeus superior; _b_, sacro-coccygeus accessorius;\r\n    _c_, coccygeus; _d_, sacro-coccygeus inferior; _e_, retractor ani;\r\n    _f_, _f′_, sphincter ani externus; _g_, retractor penis; _h_,\r\n    bulbo-cavernosus; _i_, transversus perinei (?); _k_, _m_,\r\n    ischio-urethrales; _l_, ischio-cavernosus; _n_, tendon of obturator\r\n    internus; _o_, gemellus; _p_, urethral muscle.

It arises on the sacrum, first\r\ncoccygeal vertebræ, and sacro-sciatic ligament. It is inserted below and\r\nbehind the trochanter major of the femur, on the outer branch of the\r\nlinea aspera.\r\n\r\nThe =gluteus medius= has no lumbar portion. It is inserted into the\r\ntrochanter major by a strong tendon.\r\n\r\nThe =gluteus profundus= is broad and fan-shaped. It arises on the\r\nsuperior ischiatic spine and on the ilium as far forward as the gluteal\r\nline, and is inserted into the trochanter major below the medius.\r\n\r\nThe =pyriformis= is not blended with the gluteus medius. It arises from\r\nthe border of the sacrum and from the sacro-sciatic ligament, and ends\r\non the trochanter major.\r\n\r\nThe =biceps femoris= has two heads of origin which soon fuse. The larger\r\nhead arises from the sacro-sciatic ligament and tuber ischii, the\r\nsmaller one from the tuber ischii. The aponeurosis of insertion ends on\r\nthe patella, the patellar ligament, and the tibial crest. There is also\r\na tendinous band, which comes from the deep face of the muscle and\r\nterminates at the tarsus, as in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =abductor cruris posterior= may be regarded as an accessory head of\r\nthe biceps femoris. It is a thin, muscular band which arises on the\r\nsacro-sciatic ligament, passes downward between the biceps and\r\nsemimembranosus, and ends by blending with the former.\r\n\r\nThe =semitendinosus= arises from the tuber ischii only. It ends as in\r\nthe horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 236.—MUSCLES OF PELVIC LIMB OF DOG, INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Ilio-psoas; _b_, tendon of psoas minor; _c_, sacro-coccygeus\r\n    ventralis lateralis; _d_, coccygeus; _e_, pyriformis; _f_, obturator\r\n    internus; _g_, origin of retractor ani; _h_, _h′_, sartorius; _i_,\r\n    rectus femoris; _k_, vastus internus; _l_, pectineus; _m_, adductor;\r\n    _n_, gracilis; _o_, semitendinosus; _p_, semimembranosus; _q_,\r\n    gastrocnemius, inner head; _q′_, tendon of gastrocnemius; _r_,\r\n    superficial digital flexor; _r′_, tendon of _r_; _s_, tarsal tendon\r\n    of biceps femoris; _t_, popliteus; _u_, deep digital flexor, outer\r\n    head (flexor hallucis longus); _u′_, long digital flexor; _u″_,\r\n    common tendon of u and _u′_; _v_, tendon of tibialis posterior; _w_,\r\n    tibialis anterior; _x_, tendon of anterior or long digital extensor;\r\n    _1_, pelvic surface of ilium; _2_, section of symphysis pelvis; _3_,\r\n    tuber ischii; _4_, internal condyle of femur; _5_, ligamentum\r\n    patellæ; _6_, _7_, internal surface of tibia; _8_, tarsus; _8′_,\r\n    fibular tarsal bone; _9_, metatarsus. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d.\r\n    Hundes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =semimembranosus= is large and arises from the ischium only. It\r\ndivides into two portions: the anterior portion ends on the tendon of\r\nthe pectineus, on the femur above the internal condyle, and on the inner\r\n(Vesalian) sesamoid bone; the posterior portion ends on the internal\r\ncondyle of the tibia, the tendon passing under the internal lateral\r\nligament of the stifle joint.\r\n\r\nThe =rectus femoris= has only one tendon of origin. The single patellar\r\nligament acts as the tendon of insertion of the quadriceps.\r\n\r\nThe =capsularis= is usually present, but is small and pale.\r\n\r\nThe =sartorius= consists of two portions. It arises from the external\r\nangle and border of the ilium. The anterior portion ends on the patella,\r\nthe posterior on the internal surface of the tibia, its tendon blending\r\nwith that of the gracilis.\r\n\r\nThe =graciles= are not so much fused at their origin as in the other\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nThe =pectineus= is long and slender. It arises from the ilio-pectineal\r\neminence and ends on the internal branch of the linea aspera above the\r\ndistal end of the femur.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct =adductors=. The small anterior one ends on the\r\nproximal third of the femur, the posterior one on the distal part of the\r\nfemur and on the inner face of the stifle joint.\r\n\r\nThe =quadratus femoris= is short and strong. The other external rotators\r\nof the thigh present no special features.\r\n\r\nThe =peroneus tertius= is represented by a tendinous band which arises\r\non the internal surface of the tibia below the crest. It passes downward\r\non the inner surface of the tibialis anterior, blends with the annular\r\nligament above the tarsus, and is attached to the joint capsule and the\r\nproximal end of the third metatarsal bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Arloing and Lesbre say: “The third peroneus is a proper extensor of\r\n  the fifth digit; it is a very feeble, fleshy band, situated behind the\r\n  peroneus brevis, which it partially covers. It is attached to the\r\n  upper part of the fibula, and is continued by a long, delicate tendon\r\n  which passes in the same malleolar groove with the muscle mentioned;\r\n  it then crosses behind the tendon of the peroneus longus and extends\r\n  to the phalanges of the outer digit, where it joins one of the\r\n  branches of the common extensor.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =tibialis anterior= is large and superficial. It arises on the\r\nexternal condyle and crest of the tibia, and is inserted into the first\r\nmetatarsal bone, or into the first tarsal and second metatarsal.\r\n\r\nThere are four =extensors of the digits=.\r\n\r\n1. The =anterior= or =long digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis\r\nlongus) is fusiform, and lies largely under the preceding muscle. It\r\narises from the extensor fossa of the femur. The tendon is bound down by\r\ntwo annular ligaments, and divides below the tarsus into four branches,\r\nwhich end on the distal phalanges of the digits (second to fifth).\r\n\r\n2. The =lateral digital extensor= (M. extensor digitalis lateralis) is\r\nfeeble and semipennate. It arises on the fibula below the head. The\r\ntendon passes under the lateral ligament of the tarsus and joins the\r\nbranch of the tendon of the long extensor for the fifth digit.\r\n\r\n3. The =extensor hallucis longus= is a very thin muscle which arises\r\nfrom the fibula under the long extensor. Its delicate tendon accompanies\r\nthat of the tibialis anterior to the first metatarsal bone, or becomes\r\nlost in the fascia.\r\n\r\n4. The =extensor digitalis brevis= has three divisions. It arises on the\r\nfibular tarsal bone and the adjacent ligaments. The three tendons are\r\ninserted into the second, third, and fourth digits, blending with the\r\ninterossei. (Sometimes there is found a tendon to the rudimentary first\r\ndigit, which may represent the extensor hallucis brevis. There may be a\r\nfourth belly for the tendon to the second digit.)\r\n\r\nThe =peroneus longus= arises on the external condyle of the tibia, the\r\nhead of the fibula, and the lateral ligament. The long tendon passes\r\ndown the leg parallel to the fibula, crosses the plantar (posterior)\r\nsurface of the tarsus transversely, and ends on the first metatarsal\r\nbone. A short branch is detached to the external metatarsal bone.\r\n\r\nThe =peroneus brevis= is semipennate and arises from the distal half or\r\nmore of the outer face of the tibia and the fibula. Its tendon\r\naccompanies that of the lateral extensor over the external malleolus of\r\nthe tibia, and ends on the proximal end of the fifth metatarsal bone.\r\n\r\nThe soleus is absent. (It is present and large in the cat.)\r\n\r\nThe =gastrocnemius= arises on the rough lines above the condyles of the\r\nfemur. The heads of origin each contain a bone about the size of a\r\npea—the sesamoid of Vesal—which articulates with the corresponding\r\ncondyle of the femur. The tendon comports itself as in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial digital flexor= has a large round belly. It arises in\r\ncommon with the outer head of the gastrocnemius from the external rough\r\nline and Vesalian sesamoid bone, and from the aponeurosis of the vastus\r\nexternus. The tendon winds around that of the gastrocnemius, passes over\r\nthe tuber calcis (where it is arranged as in the horse), and divides\r\nbelow the tarsus into two branches. Each of these divides into two\r\nbranches which end as in the fore limb. The outer and inner branches\r\ndetach slips to the suspensory ligaments of the large digital pad.\r\nMuscle-fibers often occur in the tendon in the metatarsal region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 237.—MUSCLES OF LEG AND FOOT OF DOG, EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Quadriceps femoris; _b_, gastrocnemius, external head; _c_,\r\n    superficial digital flexor; _d_, deep digital flexor; _e_, peroneus\r\n    longus; _f_, tendon of lateral extensor; _g_, peroneus brevis; _h_,\r\n    long or anterior digital extensor; _h′_, _h″_, _h‴_, tendons of\r\n    preceding; _i_, tibialis anterior; _k_, extensor brevis; _l_, slips\r\n    from interossei (_m_); _1_, external condyle of femur; _2_, patella;\r\n    _3_, tibia; _4_, tuber calcis; _5_, _6_, annular ligaments. (After\r\n    Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =deep digital flexor= has two heads. The large outer head, the\r\n=flexor hallucis longus=, arises from the tibia and fibula, filling the\r\ninterosseous space. The small inner head, =flexor digitalis pedis\r\nlongus=, also arises from the tibia and fibula, its tendon joining that\r\nof the large head below the tarsus. The common tendon detaches a branch\r\nto the large digital pad and terminates as in the fore limb.\r\n\r\nThe =tibialis posterior= is a small but distinct muscle, which arises on\r\nthe proximal part of the fibula. The thin tendon accompanies that of the\r\nflexor longus and ends on the internal lateral ligament of the tarsus.\r\n\r\nThe tendon of the =popliteus= contains a small sesamoid bone.\r\n\r\nThe =adductors of the second and fifth digits=, the =lumbricales=, and\r\nthe =interossei= are arranged as in the thoracic limb.\r\n\r\nThe =quadratus plantæ= arises on the outer surface of the distal end of\r\nthe fibular tarsal bone and on the lateral tarsal ligament, passes\r\ndownward and inward, and terminates on a thin tendon which fuses with\r\nthat of the deep flexor.\r\n\r\nThe =abductor digiti quinti= is a very small muscle which consists of\r\ntwo parts. One of these is a tendinous slip which extends from the\r\nposterior surface of the proximal part of the fibular tarsal bone to the\r\nhead of the fifth metatarsal bone; the other part arises from the inner\r\nsurface of the fibular tarsal bone (or from the tendinous part) and ends\r\non the first phalanx of the fifth digit.\r\n\r\nIn case the skeleton of the first digit is well developed, there are\r\nfound three muscles homologous with those of the same digit in the fore\r\nlimb. These are the =abductor hallucis=, =adductor hallucis=, and\r\n=flexor hallucis brevis=.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis system consists of the organs directly concerned in the reception\r\nand digestion of the food, its passage through the body, and the\r\nexpulsion of the unabsorbed portion. These organs are conveniently\r\ngrouped under two heads, viz.: (1) the =alimentary canal=; (2) the\r\n=accessory organs=.\r\n\r\nThe =alimentary canal= (Tractus alimentarius) is a tube, about 100 feet\r\n(ca. 30 m.) in length in the horse, and extends from the lips to the\r\nanus. It has a complete lining of mucous membrane, external to which is\r\nan almost continuous muscular coat. The abdominal portion of the tube is\r\nlargely covered with a serous membrane—the visceral peritoneum. The\r\ncanal consists of the following consecutive segments:\r\n\r\n  1. Mouth.\r\n\r\n  2. Pharynx.\r\n\r\n  3. Œsophagus.\r\n\r\n  4. Stomach.\r\n\r\n  5. Small intestine.\r\n\r\n  6. Large intestine.\r\n\r\nThe =accessory organs= are the teeth, tongue, salivary glands, liver,\r\nand pancreas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE MOUTH\r\n\r\nThe =mouth=[77] (Cavum oris) is the first part of the alimentary canal.\r\nIn the horse it is a long cylindrical cavity, and when closed, it is\r\nalmost entirely filled up by the contained structures. The entrance to\r\nit (Rima oris) is closed by the lips. Laterally it is bounded by the\r\ncheeks; above, by the hard palate; below, by the body of the mandible\r\nand the mylo-hyoid muscles; behind, by the soft palate.\r\n\r\nThe =cavity= of the mouth is subdivided into two parts by the teeth and\r\nalveolar processes. The space external to these and inclosed externally\r\nby the lips and cheeks is termed the vestibule of the mouth (Vestibulum\r\noris). In the resting state of the parts the walls of this cavity are in\r\ncontact, and the space is practically obliterated. Its existence becomes\r\nvery evident in facial paralysis, when the food tends to collect in it\r\nlaterally, pouching out the cheeks. The space within the teeth and\r\nalveolar processes is termed the mouth cavity proper (Cavum oris\r\nproprium). When the teeth are in contact, it communicates with the\r\nvestibule only by the interdental spaces and the intervals behind the\r\nlast molar teeth. Posteriorly it communicates with the pharynx through\r\nthe isthmus of the fauces.\r\n\r\nThe =mucous membrane= lining the mouth (Tunica mucosa oris) is\r\ncontinuous at the margin of the lips with the common integument, and\r\nbehind with the mucous lining of the pharynx. During life it is chiefly\r\nof a pink color.\r\n\r\nThe =lips= (Labia oris) are two musculo-membranous folds which surround\r\nthe orifice of the mouth. Their angles of union (Anguli oris s.\r\ncommissuræ labiorum) are situated near the first cheek tooth and are\r\nrounded. Each lip presents two surfaces and two borders. The outer\r\nsurface is covered by the skin, which presents long tactile hairs in\r\naddition to the ordinary fine hair. The upper lip shows a shallow median\r\nfurrow (Philtrum), the lower a rounded prominence, the chin (Mentum).\r\nThe inner or oral surface is covered with mucous membrane which is\r\ncommonly more or less pigmented. The small papillæ on this surface show\r\non their summits the openings of the ducts of the labial glands. Small\r\nfolds of mucous membrane which pass from the lip to the gum represent\r\nthe frænula labii (superioris, inferioris). The free border of the lip\r\nis dense and presents short, very stiff hairs. The attached border is\r\ncontinuous with the surrounding structures, and is adherent to the\r\nalveolar borders of the bones of the jaws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 238.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE.

The leader line for the guttural\r\n    pouch points to the external carotid artery.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The lips are covered externally by the skin, and are lined\r\nby mucous membrane; between these are muscular tissue and glands. The\r\nskin lies directly on the muscles, many fibers of which are inserted\r\ninto the former. The muscles have been described (page 214). The =labial\r\nglands= (Glandulæ labiales) form a compact mass near the angles; they\r\nare numerous in the upper lip, fewer in the lower. The mucous membrane\r\nis often pigmented, and is reflected upon the bones of the jaws to form\r\nthe gums.\r\n\r\n=Blood-vessels and Nerves.=—The arteries are derived from the superior\r\nand inferior labial and palato-labial arteries. The sensory nerves come\r\nfrom the trigeminus, and the motor from the facial nerve.\r\n\r\nThe =cheeks= (Buccæ) form the sides of the mouth, and are continuous in\r\nfront with the lips. They are attached above and below to the alveolar\r\nborders of the bones of the jaws.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—This comprises: (1) The skin; (2) the muscular and\r\nglandular layer; (3) the mucous membrane. The skin offers nothing in\r\nparticular to notice. The muscular tissue is formed mainly by the\r\nbuccinator, but also by parts of the panniculus, zygomaticus, dilatator\r\nnaris lateralis, levator nasolabialis, and depressor labii inferioris.\r\nThe =buccal glands= (Glandulæ buccales) are arranged in two rows. The\r\nupper row (superior buccal or molar glands) is found on the outer\r\nsurface of the buccinator muscle, near its upper border. The anterior\r\npart of the row consists of scattered lobules; the posterior part, which\r\nlies under cover of the masseter muscle, is more developed and compact.\r\nThe lower row (inferior buccal or molar glands), less voluminous than\r\nthe upper, is situated in the submucous tissue at the lower border of\r\nthe buccinator muscle. The mucous membrane is reflected above and below\r\nupon the gums, and is continuous behind with that of the soft palate. It\r\nis reddish in color and frequently shows pigmented areas. Opposite the\r\nthird upper cheek tooth is the opening of the parotid (Stenson’s) duct,\r\nsurrounded by a circular fold of the mucous membrane. A linear series of\r\nsmall papillæ above and below indicates the orifices of the small ducts\r\nfrom the buccal glands.\r\n\r\n=Blood-vessels and Nerves.=—The blood-supply is derived from the facial\r\nand buccinator arteries. The sensory nerves come from the trigeminus and\r\nthe motor from the facial nerve.\r\n\r\nThe =gums= (Gingivæ) are composed of a dense fibrous tissue intimately\r\nunited with the periosteum of the alveolar processes, and blending at\r\nthe edges of the alveoli with the alveolar periosteum, which fixes the\r\nteeth in their cavities. They are covered by a smooth mucous membrane,\r\ndestitute of glands, and of a low degree of sensibility.\r\n\r\nThe =hard palate= (Palatum durum) is bounded in front and on the sides\r\nby the alveolar arches; behind it is continuous with the soft palate.\r\nIts osseous basis is formed by the premaxilla, maxilla, and palate\r\nbones. The mucous membrane is smooth, and is attached to the bones by a\r\nsubmucosa which contains in its anterior part an exceedingly rich venous\r\nplexus, constituting an erectile tissue. A central raphé (Raphé palati)\r\ndivides the surface into two equal portions. Each of these presents\r\nabout eighteen transverse curved ridges (Rugæ palatini) which have their\r\nconcavity and their free edges directed backward. They are further apart\r\nand more prominent anteriorly. There are no glands in the submucosa.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The blood-supply is derived chiefly from the\r\npalatine arteries and the nerves from the trigeminus.\r\n\r\nThe =soft palate= (Palatum molle) is a musculo-membranous curtain which\r\nseparates the cavity of the mouth from that of the pharynx. It slopes\r\ndownward and backward from its junction with the hard palate. The =oral\r\nsurface= faces downward and forward, and is covered with a mucous\r\nmembrane continuous with that of the hard palate. It is corrugated and\r\npresents numerous small orifices (of gland-ducts) and two sagittal\r\nridges. On each side a short, thick fold passes to join the base of the\r\ntongue; this is the =anterior pillar= of the soft palate (Arcus\r\nglossopalatinus). The =pharyngeal surface= looks upward and backward and\r\nis covered by a mucous membrane continuous with that of the nasal\r\ncavity. The =free border= (Arcus palatinus) is concave and thin; it is\r\nin contact (except during deglutition) with the epiglottis. It is\r\ncontinuous with a fold of the mucous membrane, which passes on each side\r\nalong the lateral wall of the pharynx and unites with its fellow over\r\nthe beginning of the œsophagus; this fold is termed the =posterior\r\npillar= of the soft palate (Arcus pharyngopalatinus). The space between\r\nthe diverging anterior and posterior pillars (Sinus tonsillaris) is\r\noccupied by the faucial =tonsil=. In the horse, however, there is not a\r\ncompact tonsil, as in man, dog, etc., but a somewhat extended group of\r\nmucous glands and masses of lymphoid tissue. These cause elevations of\r\nthe surface, on which are seen numerous depressions (crypts) in which\r\nthe gland-ducts open. The soft palate is greatly developed in equidæ,\r\nits length being five to six inches (12 to 15 cm.). Its length and\r\ncontact with the epiglottis account for the fact that in these animals\r\nmouth-breathing does not occur under normal conditions, and that in\r\nvomiting the ejected matter escapes usually through the nasal\r\ncavity.[78]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 239.—HARD PALATE AND PART OF SOFT PALATE OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Raphé palati; _2_, ridges of palate; _3_, anterior end of soft\r\n    palate, showing orifices of ducts of palatine glands.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The soft palate consists of: (1) The oral mucous membrane,\r\ncontinuous with that of the hard palate; (2) the =palatine glands=\r\n(Glandulæ palatinæ), which form a layer about half an inch in thickness;\r\n(3) the aponeurotic and muscular layer; (4) the pharyngeal mucous\r\nmembrane, continuous with that of the nasal cavity.\r\n\r\nThe =muscles= proper to the soft palate are the azygos uvulæ, the\r\nlevator palati, and the tensor palati.\r\n\r\nThe =azygos uvulæ= (M. palatinus) consists of two small muscular bundles\r\nwhich lie together at the median line. It is attached through the medium\r\nof the palatine aponeurosis to the palatine arch, and terminates near\r\nthe free edge of the soft palate. Its action is to shorten and raise the\r\nsoft palate.\r\n\r\nThe =levator palati= (M. levator veli palatini) arises from the muscular\r\nprocess of the petrous temporal bone and from the Eustachian tube, and\r\npasses forward and downward externally to the latter, to spread out on\r\nthe pharyngeal surface of the soft palate. It raises the soft palate,\r\nthus closing the posterior nares during deglutition.\r\n\r\nThe =tensor palati= (M. tensor veli palatini) is larger than the\r\nlevator, and is fusiform and flattened. It arises from the muscular\r\nprocess of the petrous temporal bone and the Eustachian tube, and passes\r\nforward external to the levator. Its tendon is then reflected around the\r\nhamulus of the pterygoid bone, being held in position by a fibrous band\r\nand lubricated by a bursa. It turns inward and expands in the\r\naponeurosis of the soft palate. It tenses the soft palate.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The blood-supply of the soft palate is derived\r\nfrom the internal and external maxillary arteries. The nerves come from\r\nthe trigeminus, vagus, and glosso-pharyngeal nerves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 240.—CROSS-SECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE JUST IN FRONT OF FACIAL\r\n    CREST.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cavity of superior turbinal; _2_, cavity of inferior turbinal;\r\n    _3_, cavum oris; _4_, _4_, genio-glossi; _5_, _5_, genio-hyoidei;\r\n    _6_, hyo-glossus; _7_, upper, _7′_, lower fourth cheek tooth. Line\r\n    to facial artery crosses zygomaticus.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =floor= of the mouth in its anterior part is free and is formed by\r\nthe body of the mandible, covered by mucous membrane. The remainder is\r\nconcealed by the attached portion of the tongue, with the exception of a\r\nnarrow space on each side of the latter. About opposite the canine tooth\r\non each side is a papilla, the =caruncula sublingualis=, through which\r\nthe duct of the submaxillary gland opens. Just behind these papillæ is a\r\nmedian fold of mucous membrane which passes to the under surface of the\r\ntongue, constituting the =frenum linguæ=. On either side are the\r\nsublingual crests, which extend from the frenum to the level of the\r\nfourth cheek tooth. The crest presents numerous small papillæ, through\r\nwhich open the ducts from the subjacent sublingual gland.[79] Behind the\r\nlast tooth a vertical fold of the mucous membrane passes from upper to\r\nlower jaw. This is termed the plica pterygomandibularis: it contains a\r\nligament of like name.\r\n\r\nThe =isthmus faucium= is the orifice of communication between the mouth\r\nand the pharynx. It is bounded above by the soft palate, below by the\r\nroot of the tongue, and laterally by the anterior pillars of the soft\r\npalate. It is long, relatively small, and not very dilatable in the\r\nhorse, and is closed by the soft palate under normal conditions, except\r\nduring deglutition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE TONGUE\r\n\r\nThe =tongue= (Lingua) is situated on the floor of the mouth, between the\r\nrami of the mandible, and is supported mainly in a sort of sling formed\r\nby the mylo-hyoid muscles. Its posterior portion, the =root= (Radix\r\nlinguæ), is attached to the hyoid bone, soft palate, and pharynx. Only\r\nthe upper surface of this part is free, and slopes downward and\r\nbackward. The middle portion, the =body= (Corpus linguæ), has three free\r\nsurfaces. The upper surface or =dorsum= (Dorsum linguæ) is rounded. The\r\nlateral surfaces are nearly flat for the most part, but anteriorly\r\nbecome rounded and narrower. The lower surface is attached to the\r\nmandible. The =apex= or tip (Apex linguæ) is free, spatula-shaped, and\r\npresents superior and inferior surfaces and a rounded border.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 241.—TONGUE OF HORSE, DORSAL ASPECT.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The tongue consists of: (1) The mucous membrane; (2) the\r\nglands; (3) the muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =mucous membrane= (Tunica mucosa linguæ) adheres intimately to the\r\nsubjacent tissue, except on the lower part of the lateral surfaces of\r\nthe body and the under surface of the tip. It varies considerably in\r\nthickness. On the dorsum it is very thick and dense. Underneath this\r\nportion there is a dense fibrous cord, which extends medially a distance\r\nof five or six inches forward from the vallate papillæ. On the sides and\r\nunder surface of the tongue the membrane is much thinner and smooth, and\r\ncan more readily be dissected off the muscular tissue. From the under\r\nsurface of the free part of the tongue a fold of the mucous membrane\r\npasses to the floor of the mouth, forming the =frenum linguæ=. This\r\ncontains the anterior edges of the genio-glossi muscles. Posteriorly a\r\nfold passes on each side from the edge of the dorsum to join the soft\r\npalate, forming the anterior pillars of the latter. A central\r\nglosso-epiglottic fold (Plica glossoepiglottica) passes from the root to\r\nthe base of the epiglottis. The mucous membrane presents numerous\r\n=papillæ=, which are of four kinds—filiform, fungiform, vallate, and\r\nfoliate. The =filiform papillæ= (Papillæ filiformes) are fine, pointed\r\nprojections. They cover the upper surface of the body and tip, to which\r\nthey give a distinct pile. The =fungiform papillæ= (Papillæ fungiformes)\r\nare rounded at the free end, which is supported by a neck. They occur\r\nprincipally on the lateral part of the tongue, but are also found\r\nscattered over the dorsum and upper surface of the free portion. The\r\n=vallate papillæ= (Papillæ vallatæ) are usually two or three in number.\r\nThe two constant ones have a diameter of about 7 mm., and are found on\r\nthe posterior part of the dorsum, one on each side of the median plane,\r\nabout an inch (ca. 3 cm.) apart. The third, when present, is behind\r\nthese, is centrally situated, and is always smaller. Rarely a fourth may\r\nbe seen. They are rounded, broader at their exposed than at their\r\nattached surfaces, and are situated in a cup-shaped cavity. The =foliate\r\npapillæ= (Papillæ foliatæ) are situated just in front of the anterior\r\npillars of the soft palate, where they form a rounded eminence about an\r\ninch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.) in length, marked by transverse fissures. The last\r\nthree varieties are covered with microscopic secondary papillæ and are\r\nfurnished with taste buds. The mucous membrane of the root of the tongue\r\npresents numerous folds and depressions. Into the latter open the ducts\r\nfrom the =lingual glands= (Glandulæ linguales), which constitute a thick\r\nlayer in the loose submucous tissue. Mucous glands are found also on the\r\ndorsum and sides of the tongue. In the submucosa of the root is found\r\nalso a large quantity of lymph follicles (Folliculi tonsillares) and\r\ndiffuse lymphoid tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 242.—MUSCLES OF TONGUE, HYOID BONE, PHARYNX, ETC., OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _T. p._, Tensor palati; _L. p._, levator palati; _Pt. p._,\r\n    pterygo-pharyngeus; _P. p._, palato-pharyngeus; _S. p._,\r\n    stylo-pharyngeus; _Th. p._, thyro-pharyngeus; _C. p._,\r\n    crico-pharyngeus; _Th. h._, thyro-hyoideus; _Hyo. gl._, hyo-glossus;\r\n    _G. p._, guttural pouch; _F. p._, foliate papilla; _A. v._, facial\r\n    artery and vein. The concealed parts of the hyoid bone are indicated\r\n    by dotted line.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =muscular tissue= may be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic. The\r\nintrinsic musculature consists, not of distinct muscles, but rather of\r\nsystems of fibers which run longitudinally, vertically, and\r\ntransversely, blending with the extrinsic muscles, which are now to be\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n1. =Stylo-glossus.=—This is a long, thin muscle, which lies on the\r\nlateral part of the tongue. It arises by a thin tendon from the outer\r\nsurface of the great cornu of the hyoid bone, near the articulation with\r\nthe small cornu. It terminates near the tip of the tongue by blending\r\nwith its fellow of the opposite side and with the intrinsic musculature.\r\nThe action is to retract the tongue. Unilateral contraction would also\r\ndraw the tongue toward the side of the muscle acting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 243.—MUSCLES OF TONGUE, PHARYNX, LARYNX, ETC., DEEP DISSECTION.\r\n\r\n  _T. p._, Tensor palati; _L. p._, levator palati, concealed part\r\n    indicated by dotted line; _Pt. p._, pterygo-pharyngeus; _P. p._,\r\n    palato-pharyngeus; _St. p._, stylo-pharyngeus; _C. a._,\r\n    crico-arytenoideus post.; _C. th._, crico-thyroideus; _Th. c._,\r\n    thyroid cartilage (wing); _Th. h._, thyro-hyoideus; _K. h._,\r\n    kerato-hyoideus; _Th. c._, thyroid cornu; _S. c._, small cornu; _L.\r\n    p._, lingual process; _F. p._, foliate papilla; _Fu. p._, fungiform\r\n    papillæ. Part of great cornu is removed and indicated by dotted\r\n    line.\r\n]\r\n\r\n2. =Hyo-glossus.=—This is a wide, flat muscle, somewhat thicker than the\r\npreceding. It lies on the lateral part of the root and body of the\r\ntongue, partly under cover of the preceding muscle. Its deep face is\r\nrelated to the genio-glossus. It arises from the lateral aspect of the\r\nhyoid bone, from the lingual process to the oral extremity of the great\r\ncornu, and from the thyroid cornu. The fibers pass obliquely forward and\r\nupward, and for the most part turn toward the median plane of the dorsum\r\nof the tongue. Its action is to retract and depress the tongue.\r\n\r\n(It is usually possible to recognize in this muscle three portions,\r\nwhich would correspond to the baseo-, kerato-, and chondro-glossus of\r\nhuman anatomy.)\r\n\r\n3. =Genio-glossus.=—This is a fan-shaped muscle, which lies parallel to\r\nthe median plane of the tongue. It is separated from the muscle of the\r\nopposite side by a quantity of fat and connective tissue. It arises from\r\nthe inner surface of the ramus of the mandible near the symphysis. From\r\nthe tendon the fibers pass in a radiating manner, some toward the tip,\r\nothers toward the dorsum, and others toward the root of the tongue; some\r\nfibers pass from the posterior end of the tendon to the body and small\r\ncornu of the hyoid bone. The muscle as a whole is a depressor of the\r\ntongue, and especially of its middle portion; when both muscles act, a\r\nmedian groove is formed on the dorsum. The posterior fibers protrude the\r\ntongue, the middle fibers depress the tongue, and the anterior fibers\r\nretract the tip of the tongue.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The arteries of the tongue are the lingual and\r\nsublingual branches of the external maxillary artery. The sensory nerves\r\nare the lingual and glosso-pharyngeal, and the muscles are innervated by\r\nthe hypoglossal nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE TEETH\r\n\r\nThe teeth are hard white or yellowish-white structures, implanted in the\r\nalveoli of the bones of the jaws—premaxilla, maxilla, and mandible.\r\nMorphologically they are large calcified papillæ. Functionally they are\r\norgans of prehension and mastication, and may serve as weapons of\r\noffense and defense. They are classified according to form and position\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n1. =The incisor teeth= (Dentes incisivi) are situated in front and are\r\nimplanted in the premaxilla and mandible.\r\n\r\n2. =The canine teeth= (Dentes canini) are situated a little further\r\nback, at or near the premaxillary suture in the upper jaw; in the lower\r\njaw they are nearer the incisors.\r\n\r\n3. =The cheek teeth= (Dentes premolares et molares), the remaining\r\nteeth, occupy the sides of the dental arch. The space between the\r\nincisors and cheek teeth is termed the interdental or interalveolar\r\nspace. It is customary to divide the cheek teeth into an anterior\r\nseries, termed =premolars=, which appear as temporary, deciduous, or\r\nmilk teeth, and are replaced by permanent successors, and a posterior\r\nseries, the =molars=, which appear only as permanent teeth without\r\ndeciduous predecessors.\r\n\r\nAs the teeth of the two sides of the jaws are alike in number and\r\ncharacter (in normal cases), the complete dentition may be briefly\r\nindicated by a =dental formula= such as the following:\r\n\r\n                        (   2   1   2   3 )\r\n                      2 ( I - C - P - M - ) = 32.\r\n                        (   2   1   2   3 )\r\n\r\nIn this formula the letters indicate the kinds of teeth, and the figures\r\nabove and below the lines give the number of teeth of one side in the\r\nupper and lower jaw respectively in man.\r\n\r\nThe individual teeth of each group are designated numerically, the\r\nstarting-point being the middle line; thus the incisor on either side of\r\nthe middle line is the first incisor, and may be conveniently indicated\r\nby the notation I^1. The temporary or deciduous teeth may be designated\r\nin a similar manner, prefixing D (for deciduous) to the letter\r\nindicating the kind of tooth. In addition to the above systematic method\r\nof notation other terms have received the sanction of popular usage.\r\nThus the first incisors are commonly called “pinchers,” or “nippers”;\r\nthe second, intermediate; and the third, corner teeth. The canines, when\r\nhighly developed, may be termed tusks or fangs. The vestigial and\r\ninconstant first premolar of the horse is popularly termed the “wolf\r\ntooth.”\r\n\r\nEach tooth presents for description a portion coated with enamel, termed\r\nthe =crown= (Corona dentis), and a portion covered with cement, termed\r\nthe =root= (Radix dentis). The line of union of these parts is the neck\r\n(Collum dentis).[80] In many teeth the neck is distinct and is embraced\r\nby the gum, _e. g._, the teeth of the dog and the temporary incisors of\r\nthe horse. In other teeth no constriction is seen, as in the permanent\r\nincisors of the horse. Between these extremes may be noted the molars of\r\nthe horse, in which the neck is seen only in advanced age.\r\n\r\nThe =surface= of a tooth directed toward the lips is termed =labial=;\r\ntoward the cheek, =buccal=; and toward the tongue, =lingual= (Facies\r\nlabialis, buccalis, lingualis). The surface opposed to a neighboring\r\ntooth of the same dental arch is termed the =contact surface= (Facies\r\ncontactus). The grinding or =masticatory= or “table” surface (Facies\r\nmasticatoria) is that which comes in contact with a tooth or teeth of\r\nthe opposite jaw.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—Teeth are composed of four tissues, which are considered\r\nhere from within outward. The =pulp= (Pulpa dentis) is a soft gelatinous\r\ntissue, which occupies a space in the central part of the tooth termed\r\nthe =pulp cavity= (Cavum dentis). The pulp is well supplied with\r\nblood-vessels and nerves. It occupies a relatively large space in young\r\ngrowing teeth, but later the dentine deposited on its surface gradually\r\nencroaches on it until, in advanced age, the cavity is obliterated or\r\nmuch reduced. The =dentine= (Substantia eburnea) forms the bulk of most\r\nteeth, covering the surface of the pulp. It is very hard, and is\r\nyellowish-white in color. The =enamel= (Substantia adamantina)\r\nconstitutes a layer of varying thickness covering the dentine of the\r\ncrown of the tooth. It is easily distinguished by its clear bluish-white\r\nappearance and its extreme density. The =cement= (Substantia ossea) is\r\nalways the outermost tooth substance. In simple teeth it forms usually a\r\nthin layer on the surface of the dentine of the root only, but in\r\ncomplex teeth it exists in considerable quantity, tending to fill in the\r\nspaces between the enamel folds of the crown also. Its structure is\r\npractically the same as that of bone without Haversian canals, and even\r\nthese occur where the cement forms a very thick layer. The embedded part\r\nof the tooth is attached to the alveolus by a vascular layer of\r\nconnective tissue, the =alveolar periosteum= (Periosteum alveolare),\r\nwhich constitutes the periosteum at once of tooth and alveolus.\r\n\r\nThe =blood-supply= to the pulp is derived from the alveolar or dental\r\nbranches of the internal artery; the =nerve-supply= comes from branches\r\nof the trigeminus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE TEETH OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE PERMANENT TEETH\r\n\r\nThe formula of the permanent teeth of the horse is:\r\n\r\n                   (   3   1   3 or 4   3 )\r\n                 2 ( I - C - P —————— M - ) = 40 or 42\r\n                   (   3   1     3      3 )\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 244.—UPPER TEETH OF HORSE, ABOUT FOUR AND ONE-HALF YEARS OLD.\r\n\r\n  _I^1_, _I^2_, _I^3_, Incisors; _C_, canine; _P^1_, _P^2_, _P^3_,\r\n    _P^4_, premolars; _M^1_, _M^2_, _M^3_, molars.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 245.—LOWER TEETH OF HORSE, FOUR YEARS OF AGE.\r\n\r\n  _I^1_, _I^2_, First and second permanent incisors; _Di^3_, third\r\n    deciduous incisor. The cheek teeth are numbered according to popular\r\n    usage.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the mare the canines usually are very small and do not erupt,\r\nreducing the number to 36 or 38.[81]\r\n\r\n=Incisor Teeth.=—These are twelve in number. The six in each jaw are\r\nplaced close together, so that their labial edges form almost a\r\nsemicircle. They have the peculiarity (not found in existing mammals\r\nother than the equidæ) of presenting, instead of the simple cap of\r\nenamel on the crown, a deep invagination, the =infundibulum=, which\r\nbecomes partly filled up with cement. Hence as the tooth wears the table\r\nsurface has a central ring of enamel surrounding this cavity in addition\r\nto the peripheral enamel. The cavity becomes darkened by deposits from\r\nthe food, and is commonly termed the “cup” or “mark.” Each tooth is\r\ncurved so that the labial surface is convex and the roots converge. The\r\naverage length of the incisors at five or six years of age is about two\r\nand a half to three inches (ca. 7 cm.). They taper regularly from crown\r\nto root, without any constriction, and in such a manner that in young\r\nhorses the exposed crown is broad transversely; toward the middle, the\r\ntwo diameters of a cross-section are about equal; near the root the\r\nantero-posterior diameter is considerably greater than the transverse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 246.—LOWER INCISOR AND CANINE TEETH OF HORSE, FIVE YEARS OLD.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 247.—UPPER INCISOR AND CANINE TEETH OF HORSE, FIVE YEARS OLD.\r\n\r\n  _I^1_, _I^2_, _I^3_, Incisors; _C_, canine.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis fact is of value in the determination of age by the teeth, since\r\nthe table surface at different ages represents a series of such\r\ncross-sections. As the exposed crown wears down the embedded part\r\n(reserve crown) pushes up out of the alveolus, so that the tables of the\r\nfirst and second lower incisors are at first oval, with the long\r\ndiameter transverse; later—at about fourteen years usually for the first\r\nlower incisors—the tables are triangular, with the base at the labial\r\nedge. At the same time the infundibulum or cup becomes smaller,\r\napproaches the lingual border, and finally disappears; it remains longer\r\non the upper incisors, as it is deeper in them. Another marked feature\r\nin old age is the progressive approach to a horizontal direction as seen\r\nin profile; at the same time the teeth become parallel and finally\r\nconvergent.\r\n\r\n=Canine Teeth.=—These are four in number in the male; in the mare they\r\nare usually absent or rudimentary.[82] They interrupt the interdental\r\nspace, dividing it into two unequal parts. The upper canine is situated\r\nat the junction of the premaxilla and the maxilla; the lower canine is\r\nplaced nearer the corner incisor. The canines are simple teeth, smaller\r\nthan the incisors, and are curved with the concavity directed backward.\r\nThe crown is compressed, convex, and smooth externally; concave with a\r\nmedian ridge internally; its edges are sharp, and the apex is pointed in\r\nthe unworn tooth. The root is round and the pulp cavity is large,\r\npersisting to advanced age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 248.—LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF PERMANENT INCISOR TOOTH OF HORSE,\r\n    ABOUT NATURAL SIZE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 249.—INCISOR TOOTH OF HORSE, LINGUAL ASPECT. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 250.—CANINE AND INCISOR TEETH OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The bone has been removed to show the embedded parts of the teeth.\r\n    (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Cheek Teeth= (Premolars and Molars).[83]—The constant number of these\r\nis twenty-four—twelve in each jaw. Quite commonly, however, the number\r\nis increased by the presence in the upper jaw of the so-called wolf\r\ntooth. This tooth is usually situated just in front of the first\r\nwell-developed tooth; it is a much reduced vestige, not often more than\r\none-half or three-fourths of an inch (ca. 1 to 2 cm.) in length. (It is\r\ninteresting as being the remnant of a tooth which was well developed in\r\nthe Eocene ancestors of the horse.) It may erupt during the first six\r\nmonths, and is often shed about the same time as the milk-tooth behind\r\nit, but may remain indefinitely. The occurrence of a similar tooth in\r\nthe lower jaw—which rarely erupts—increases the dental formula to 44,\r\nwhich is considered the typical number for mammals. They may be regarded\r\nas belonging to the permanent set, having no predecessors. The cheek\r\nteeth are very large, prismatic in form, and quadrilateral in\r\ncross-section, except the first and last of the series, which are\r\ntriangular. The crown is remarkably long, most of it being embedded in\r\nthe bone or situated in the maxillary sinus in the young horse. As the\r\nexposed part wears down the embedded part pushes up to replace it, so\r\nthat a functional crown of about four-fifths of an inch (ca. 2 cm.) is\r\nmaintained. The root begins to grow at four or five years of age, and is\r\ncomplete at twelve to fourteen, although the deposition of cement may\r\ncontinue indefinitely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 251.—SKULL OF ADULT HORSE SCULPTURED TO EMBEDDED PARTS OF TEETH.\r\n\r\n  The bone has been removed to show the embedded parts of the teeth\r\n    _I^1_, _I^2_, _I^3_, Incisors; _C_, canines. The cheek teeth are\r\n    numbered.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =upper= or =maxillary teeth= are embedded in the alveolar processes\r\nof the maxilla. The exposed parts of the crowns are normally in close\r\ncontact, forming a continuous row which is slightly curved, with the\r\nconvexity toward the cheek. The embedded parts diverge in the manner\r\nshown in the annexed figures (Figs. 251, 253). Thus the long axis of the\r\nfirst is directed upward and a little forward, that of the second is\r\nalmost vertical, while in the remainder it is curved backward in an\r\nincreasing degree. The average =length= at six years of age is about\r\nthree to three and a half inches (ca. 7 to 9 cm.). The =buccal= (or\r\nouter) =surface= presents a central ridge running lengthwise, and\r\nseparating two grooves; the first tooth has, in addition, a less\r\nprominent ridge in front of the primary one. The =lingual= (or inner)\r\n=surface= is marked by a wide, rounded ridge, the accessory pillar or\r\ncolumn, which separates two very shallow grooves. The =masticatory= or\r\n=table surface= presents two infundibula, an anterior and a posterior.\r\nIt slopes obliquely downward and outward, so that the outer edge is\r\nprominent and sharp. The first and last teeth have three roots, the\r\nremainder four or three.\r\n\r\nThe position of the embedded crowns and roots of the last four varies at\r\ndifferent ages and in different subjects. Two factors in this variation\r\nmay be noted. All these teeth are developed in the maxillary sinus close\r\nto the orbital fossa. As growth proceeds the teeth move forward, so that\r\ncommonly only the last three, but sometimes also the third, remain\r\n(except as to their free crowns) in the sinus. The second cause of\r\nvariation is the fact that the anterior limit of the maxillary sinus may\r\nbe at the extremity of the facial ridge, or more than an inch beyond it.\r\nIn the latter case the third tooth projects into the sinus.[84]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 252.—CROSS-SECTIONS OF CHEEK TEETH OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  Buccal (outer) surfaces face to left. _A_, Upper tooth, _B_, lower\r\n    tooth; _I_, anterior, _I′_, posterior infundibulum, both almost\r\n    filled up with cement.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =structure= is quite complex. Two infundibula run vertically through\r\nthe entire length of the crown; these become filled with cement. There\r\nare five main divisions of the pulp-cavity and five enamel folds, four\r\nof which are arranged symmetrically, while the fifth is an outgrowth\r\nfrom the inner side of the antero-internal fold. On the exposed crown of\r\nthe unworn tooth the enamel folds form rounded ridges covered with a\r\nthin layer of cement. After the tooth comes into wear the enamel on the\r\nmasticatory surface stands out in the form of sharp prominent ridges.\r\nProgressive cementation of the periphery of the tooth takes place, thus\r\nleveling up the irregularities of surface to a considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThe =lower= or =mandibular cheek teeth= are implanted in the rami of the\r\nmandible, forming two straight rows which diverge behind. The space\r\nbetween the rows is considerably less than that separating the upper\r\nteeth, especially in the middle of the series. The length of the lower\r\nteeth is about the same as that of the upper set. Their direction is\r\nalso similar, but the embedded portions diverge even more, with the\r\nexception of the first and second. The long axis of the first is\r\nvertical; the remainder project downward and backward in a gradually\r\nincreasing obliquity. The =buccal= (outer) =surface= has a longitudinal\r\nfurrow; the last molar has a secondary, shallower furrow in addition.\r\nThe =lingual= (inner) =surface= is uneven, but the grooves are not\r\nregular; there are usually three on the first and last tooth. The\r\n=masticatory= or =table surface= is oblique, sloping upward and inward\r\nin correspondence with the opposing tooth; thus the inner edge is\r\nprominent. The first five have two roots, while the sixth commonly has\r\nthree. The width of the lower molars is a little more than half that of\r\nthe upper. There are two infundibula, which are open along the inner\r\nface of the tooth until closed by cement. The pulp-cavity has two\r\nprincipal divisions, and four or three secondary diverticula. The enamel\r\nfolds correspond, forming a pattern even more complicated than on the\r\nupper teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 253.—SKULL OF TWO-YEAR-OLD COLT, SCULPTURED TO SHOW THE EMBEDDED\r\n    PARTS OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\n  Both permanent and temporary cheek teeth are shown.

They\r\nhave a distinct =neck= at the junction of the crown and root. The\r\n=crown= is short, white in color, and its labial surface is smooth. The\r\n=infundibulum= is shallow. The =root= is flattened; it undergoes\r\nabsorption as the permanent tooth develops behind it.\r\n\r\nThe =deciduous canines= are quite vestigial. They occur in both sexes as\r\nslender spiculæ about a quarter of an inch in length, but do not erupt.\r\nThe lower one develops close to the corner incisor. They are not usually\r\nincluded in the formula, as they are never functional.\r\n\r\nThe =deciduous cheek teeth= differ from the permanent set chiefly in\r\nthat they have much shorter crowns than the latter. The roots form\r\nearly, so that a distinct neck occurs.\r\n\r\nThe subjoined table indicates the average periods of the eruption of the\r\nteeth:\r\n\r\n                  TEETH                            ERUPTION\r\n\r\n    A. _Deciduous_:\r\n       1st incisor                  (Di 1) Birth or first week.\r\n       2nd    „                     (Di 2) 4–6 weeks.\r\n       3rd    „                     (Di 3) 6–9 months.\r\n       Canine                       (Dc  )\r\n       1st premolar                 (Dp 2) Birth or first two weeks.\r\n       2nd     „                    (Dp 3)             „\r\n       3rd     „                    (Dp 4)             „\r\n\r\n    B. _Permanent_:\r\n\r\n       1st incisor                  (I  1) 2½ years.\r\n       2nd    „                     (I  2) 3½ years.\r\n       3rd    „                     (I  3) 4½ years.\r\n       Canine.

Their ducts open into the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe =parotid gland= (Glandula parotis) (Fig. 172)—so named from its\r\nproximity to the ear—is the largest of the salivary glands in the horse.\r\nIt is situated chiefly in the space between the ramus of the mandible\r\nand the wing of the atlas. It is somewhat triangular in shape, the apex\r\npartially embracing the base of the external ear. Its length is about\r\neight to ten inches (ca. 20 to 25 cm.), and its average thickness nearly\r\nan inch (ca. 2 cm.). Its average weight is about seven ounces (ca. 200\r\nto 225 g.).\r\n\r\nIt presents for description two surfaces, two borders, a base, and an\r\napex. The =external= (or superficial) =surface= is covered by the\r\nparotid fascia, the panniculus, and the parotido-auricularis muscle. It\r\nis crossed obliquely by the jugular vein, which is embedded in the gland\r\ntissue to a varying extent. It is also related to the great auricular\r\nvein, the cervical branch of the facial nerve, and branches of the\r\nsecond cervical nerve. The =internal= (or deep) =surface= is very\r\nuneven, and has numerous important relations. Some of these are: the\r\nguttural pouch, and the great cornu of the hyoid bone; the masseter,\r\nstylo-maxillaris, digastricus, and occipito-hyoideus muscles; the\r\ntendons of the mastoido-humeralis and sterno-cephalicus (which separate\r\nthe parotid from the underlying submaxillary gland); the external\r\ncarotid artery and some of its branches; the facial nerve; the\r\npharyngeal lymph glands. The =anterior= (or facial) =border= is closely\r\nattached to the ramus of the mandible and the masseter muscle; it\r\noverlaps the latter to a varying extent. (In some cases there is a\r\nwell-marked triangular facial process, which covers the\r\ntemporo-mandibular joint, the facial nerve, and the transverse facial\r\nvessels.) The =posterior= (or cervical) =border= is somewhat concave,\r\nand is loosely attached to the underlying muscles. The =base= or\r\n=ventral border= is related to the external maxillary vein. The =apex=\r\nis attached to the base of the external ear, which it partially\r\nembraces.\r\n\r\nThe gland has a yellowish-gray color and is distinctly lobulated. It is\r\ninclosed in a capsule formed by the parotid fascia. The =parotid duct=\r\n(Ductus parotideus Stenonis) is formed at the lower part of the gland,\r\nnear the facial edge, by the union of three or four radicles. It leaves\r\nthe gland about an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.) above the external maxillary\r\nvein, crosses the tendon of the sterno-cephalicus, and gains the inner\r\nface of the pterygoideus internus. It then runs forward in the\r\nsubmaxillary space below the external maxillary vein and winds around\r\nthe lower border of the mandible behind the vein, passes upward between\r\nthe vein and the masseter muscle for about two inches (ca. 5 cm.), turns\r\nforward underneath the facial vessels, and perforates the cheek\r\nobliquely opposite the third upper cheek tooth. Before piercing the\r\ncheek it is somewhat dilated, but its termination is small, and is\r\nsurrounded by a circular mucous fold (Papilla salivalis).\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Branches of the carotid and maxillary arteries.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Trigeminal, facial, and sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =submaxillary gland= (Glandula submaxillaris) is much smaller than\r\nthe parotid. It is long, narrow, and curved, the dorsal edge being\r\nconcave. It extends from the fossa below the wing of the atlas to the\r\nbody of the hyoid bone, so that it is covered partly by the parotid\r\ngland, partly by the lower jaw. Its length is about eight to ten inches\r\n(ca. 20 to 25 cm.), its width an inch to an inch and a half (ca. 2.5 to\r\n3 cm.), and its thickness about half an inch (ca. 1 cm.). It weighs\r\nabout one and a half to two ounces (ca. 45 to 60 g.). It is often\r\ndivisible into two parts.\r\n\r\nIt presents for description two surfaces, two borders, and two\r\nextremities. The =external surface= is covered by the parotid gland, the\r\nstylo-maxillaris, digastricus, and pterygoideus internus muscles. The\r\ntendon of the sterno-cephalicus crosses this surface, and is a useful\r\nguide in separating the parotid gland from it. The =internal surface= is\r\nrelated chiefly to the flexor muscles of the head; the guttural pouch;\r\nthe larynx; the division of the carotid artery; and the tenth, eleventh,\r\nand sympathetic nerves. The =superior border= is concave and thin. It is\r\nrelated to the guttural pouch and the duct of the gland. The =inferior\r\nborder= is convex and thicker. It is related to the thyroid gland and\r\nthe external maxillary vein. The =posterior extremity= is loosely\r\nattached in the fossa atlantis. The =anterior extremity= lies at the\r\nside of the root of the tongue, and is crossed externally by the\r\nexternal maxillary artery.\r\n\r\nThe =submaxillary duct= (Ductus submaxillaris Whartoni) is formed by the\r\nunion of small radicles which emerge along the concave edge. It runs\r\nforward along this border, and, after leaving the anterior extremity,\r\ncrosses the intermediate tendon of the digastricus, passes between the\r\nhyo-glossus and mylo-hyoideus, and gains the inner surface of the\r\nsublingual gland. Its terminal part lies on the body of the mandible,\r\nunder the mucous membrane, which it pierces opposite the canine tooth.\r\nThe orifice is at the end of a flattened papilla (Caruncula\r\nsublingualis).\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Occipital, external carotid, and external maxillary\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Chorda tympani and sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =sublingual gland= (Glandula sublingualis) is situated beneath the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth, between the body of the tongue and the\r\nramus of the mandible. It extends from the symphysis to the third or\r\nfourth lower cheek tooth. Its length is about five or six inches (ca. 12\r\nto 15 cm.) and its weight about half an ounce (ca. 15 to 16 g.).\r\n\r\nIt is flattened laterally, and has a thin =upper border= which causes an\r\nelevation of the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth, termed the\r\n=sublingual crest= (Plica sublingualis). The =external surface= is\r\nrelated to the mylo-hyoideus muscle, and the =internal surface= to the\r\ngenio-glossus and stylo-glossus, the submaxillary duct, and branches of\r\nthe lingual nerve. The =inferior border= is related to the genio-hyoid\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\nThe =sublingual ducts= (Ductus sublinguales minores), about thirty in\r\nnumber, are small, short, and twisted; they open on small papillæ on the\r\nsublingual crest.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Sublingual artery.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Trigeminal and sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PHARYNX\r\n\r\nThe pharynx is a musculo-membranous sac which belongs to the digestive\r\nand respiratory tracts in common. It is funnel-shaped, the base joining\r\nthe mouth and nasal cavity, while the apex is continued by the\r\nœsophagus. Its long axis is directed obliquely downward and backward,\r\nand has a length of about six inches (ca. 15 cm.).\r\n\r\nThe pharynx is attached by its muscles to the palate, pterygoid, and\r\nhyoid bones, and to the cricoid and thyroid cartilages of the larynx.\r\n\r\nIts principal =relations= are: dorsally, the base of the cranium and the\r\nguttural pouches; ventrally, the larynx; laterally, the internal\r\npterygoid muscle, the great cornu of the hyoid bone, the internal and\r\nexternal maxillary arteries, the glosso-pharyngeal, superior laryngeal,\r\nand hypoglossal nerves, the submaxillary salivary gland, and the\r\npharyngeal lymph glands.\r\n\r\nIt presents =seven openings=. The =posterior nares= (Choanæ) communicate\r\ndorsally with the nasal chambers. The pharyngeal orifices (Ostia\r\npharyngea) of the two =Eustachian tubes= are situated on the lateral\r\nwall behind the nares and a little below the level of the inferior nasal\r\nmeatus. They are slit-like openings, slightly oblique downward and\r\nbackward, and are a little more than an inch (ca. 3 cm.) in length. They\r\nare bounded internally by a valvular flap formed by the expanded\r\nextremity of the cartilaginous Eustachian tube. The =isthmus faucium= is\r\nsituated below and in front. It is closed by the soft palate except\r\nduring swallowing. The =laryngeal orifice= (Aditus laryngis) occupies\r\nthe greater part of the ventral wall or floor of the pharynx. Behind\r\nthis is the =œsophageal opening=.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the pharynx comprises from without inward: the muscles, the\r\npharyngeal aponeurosis, and the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nThe =muscles= (Figs. 243, 244) are covered by the pharyngeal fascia,\r\nwhich is attached to the base of the skull, the great cornu of the hyoid\r\nbone, and the thyroid cartilage of the larynx. They are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =stylo-pharyngeus= arises from the inner surface of the dorsal\r\nthird of the great cornu of the hyoid bone, passes downward and inward,\r\nand enters the wall of the pharynx by passing between the\r\npterygo-pharyngeus and palato-pharyngeus. Its fibers radiate, many\r\npassing forward, others inward beneath the hyo-pharyngeus. It raises and\r\ndilates the pharynx to receive the bolus in swallowing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 254.—POSTERIOR PART OF A SAGITTAL SECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE, CUT\r\n    ABOUT 1 CM. TO THE LEFT OF THE MEDIAN PLANE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Posterior nares; _2_, pharyngeal orifice of Eustachian tube; _3_,\r\n    aditus laryngis; _4_, entrance to œsophagus; _5_, posterior pillar\r\n    of soft palate; _5′_, junction of _5_ with its fellow over entrance\r\n    to œsophagus; _6_, epiglottis; _7_, body of thyroid cartilage; _8_,\r\n    arytenoid cartilage; _9_, _9_, cricoid cartilage; _10_, true vocal\r\n    cord; _11_, false vocal cord; _12_, lateral ventricle of larynx;\r\n    _13_, crico-arytenoideus post. s. dorsalis; _14_, œsophagus; _15_,\r\n    external carotid artery; _16_, hypoglossal nerve; _17_,\r\n    glosso-pharyngeal nerve; _18_, great cornu of hyoid bone; _19_,\r\n    Eustachian tube; _20_, body of hyoid bone; _21_, hyoideus\r\n    transversus; _22_, ridges of hard palate; _22′_, soft palate; _23_,\r\n    septum between frontal sinuses; _24_, olfactory mucous membrane;\r\n    _25_, sphenoidal sinus; _26_, basilar part of occipital bone; _26′_,\r\n    supraoccipital; _27_, body of sphenoid bone; _28_, pituitary body;\r\n    _29_, chiasma opticum; _30_, corpora quadrigemina; _31_, thalamus;\r\n    _32_, arachnoid; _33_, odontoid ligament; _34_, posterior auricular\r\n    muscles.\r\n]\r\n\r\n2. The =palato-pharyngeus= arises by means of the aponeurosis of the\r\nsoft palate from the palate and pterygoid bones. Its fibers pass\r\nbackward on the lateral wall of the pharynx, and are inserted in part\r\ninto the upper edge of the thyroid cartilage, in part turn inward to end\r\nat the median fibrous raphé. Its action is to shorten the pharynx, and\r\nto draw the larynx and œsophagus toward the root of the tongue in\r\nswallowing.\r\n\r\n3. The =pterygo-pharyngeus= is flat and triangular. It lies on the\r\nanterior part of the lateral wall of the pharynx. It arises from the\r\npterygoid bone above the preceding muscle—from which it is not\r\ndistinctly separated—crosses the levator palati, and is inserted into\r\nthe median raphé. Its action is similar to the preceding.\r\n\r\n4. The =hyo-pharyngeus= may consist of two portions:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =kerato-pharyngeus= is a small and inconstant muscle which\r\narises from the inner surface of the great cornu of the hyoid bone near\r\nits lower end. It passes upward and backward, turns inward toward the\r\nraphé, and spreads out under the next muscle.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =chondro-pharyngeus=, broad and fleshy, arises from the\r\nthyroid cornu of the hyoid bone and by a thin fasciculus from the wing\r\nof the thyroid cartilage and ends at the median raphé.\r\n\r\n5. The =thyro-pharyngeus= arises from the lateral surface of the wing of\r\nthe thyroid cartilage. Its fibers pass forward and inward to the median\r\nraphé.\r\n\r\n6. The =crico-pharyngeus= arises from the cricoid cartilage and ends at\r\nthe raphé. The fibers are directed upward, forward, and inward; they\r\nblend behind with the longitudinal fibers of the œsophagus.\r\n\r\nThe last three muscles are constrictors of the pharynx.\r\n\r\nThe =pharyngeal aponeurosis= is attached to the base of the cranium. It\r\nis well developed on the inner face of the palato-pharyngeus muscle and\r\nforms a median raphé (Raphé pharyngis) dorsally, which is wide in its\r\nposterior part.\r\n\r\nThe =mucous membrane= of the pharynx is continuous with that of the\r\nseveral cavities which open into it. It is thin and closely adherent to\r\nthe base of the skull in the vicinity of the posterior nares, where the\r\nmuscular wall is absent. Behind the Eustachian openings is a median\r\ncul-de-sac, the =pharyngeal recess=. The recess is somewhat variable,\r\nbut is usually about an inch in depth and will admit the end of the\r\nfinger. In the ass and mule it is much deeper. Here also the muscular\r\nwall is absent and the mucous membrane lies against the guttural\r\npouches. From the Eustachian opening a fold of the mucous membrane\r\n(Plica salpingo-pharyngea) passes toward but does not reach the\r\nlaryngeal opening. Below, a horizontal fold, the =posterior pillar of\r\nthe soft palate= (Arcus pharyngopalatinus), passes along the lateral\r\nwall and unites with its fellow over the entrance to the œsophagus. The\r\nupper part of the cavity (the naso-pharynx) is lined with a ciliated\r\nepithelium, while the lower part (oro-pharynx) has a stratified squamous\r\nepithelium. The communication between the two is oval and is bounded by\r\nthe free edge of the soft palate and its posterior pillars; it is termed\r\nthe =pharyngeal isthmus=. On either side of the laryngeal opening is a\r\nnarrow deep depression, the =pyriform sinus= (Recessus piriformis).\r\n\r\nThe submucous tissue contains numerous mucous glands (Glandulæ\r\npharyngeæ). In the young subject the lymph follicles are numerous and\r\nform a collection dorsally and between the Eustachian openings, known as\r\nthe pharyngeal tonsil.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—External carotid, external maxillary, and\r\nthyro-laryngeal arteries.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Glosso-pharyngeal, vagus, and sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ŒSOPHAGUS\r\n\r\nThe œsophagus is a musculo-membranous tube, about 50 to 60 inches (ca.\r\n125 to 150 cm.) in length, which extends from the pharynx to the\r\nstomach. It begins in the median plane above the cricoid cartilage of\r\nthe larynx. In its course it shows several changes of direction. At the\r\nlevel of the fourth cervical vertebra it inclines to the left side of\r\nthe trachea, and continues this relation to the level of the third\r\nthoracic vertebra. Here it again gains the dorsal surface of the\r\ntrachea, and passing backward, crosses the left bronchus, being here\r\nalmost in the median plane. It continues in the mediastinum between the\r\nlungs backward, upward, and a little to the left, to reach the hiatus\r\nœsophageus of the diaphragm. Passing through this it terminates at once\r\nat the cardiac orifice of the stomach, at the level of the fourteenth\r\nthoracic vertebra, a little to the left of the median plane, and about\r\nfour or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) ventral to the vertebral column.\r\n\r\nViewed with reference to the frontal plane, its course is downward and\r\nbackward till it enters the thorax and passes upward to gain the dorsal\r\nface of the trachea. For a short distance (_i. e._, to the root of the\r\nlung) its direction is almost horizontal; behind this it passes somewhat\r\nupward to its termination. The =cervical part= of the tube is about four\r\nto six inches (10 to 15 cm.) longer than the =thoracic part=, while the\r\nso-called abdominal part is about an inch (2 to 3 cm.) long.[85]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 255.—CROSS-SECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The section passes through the temporo-mandibular articulation, but is\r\n    slightly oblique. _1_, Corpus callosum; _2_, lateral ventricle of\r\n    brain; _3_, caudate nucleus; _4_, internal capsule; _5_, lenticular\r\n    nucleus; _6_, optic chiasma; _7_, middle cerebral artery; _8_,\r\n    sphenoidal sinuses; _9_, cavernous sinus; _10_, Eustachian tube,\r\n    inner lamina; _11_, _11_, guttural pouches; _12_, soft palate; _13_,\r\n    epiglottis; _14_, hyo-epiglottic muscle; _15_, thyro-hyoid muscle.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe principal =relations= of the œsophagus at its origin are: to the\r\ncricoid cartilage below; to the guttural pouches and the ventral\r\nstraight muscles above; and to the carotid arteries laterally. In the\r\nmiddle of the neck the relations are: to the left longus colli muscle\r\nabove; to the trachea internally; to the left carotid artery, vagus,\r\nsympathetic, and recurrent nerves externally. At its entrance into the\r\nthorax it has the trachea on its inner side; the first rib, the roots of\r\nthe brachial plexus of nerves and the inferior cervical ganglion\r\nexternally. After gaining the upper surface of the trachea, it has the\r\naorta on its left and the vena azygos and right vagus nerve on its right\r\nside. In its course through the posterior mediastinum the œsophageal\r\ntrunks of the vagus nerves lie above and below it, and the œsophageal\r\nartery is dorsal to it.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The wall is composed of four coats: (1) A fibrous sheath;\r\n(2) the muscular coat; (3) a submucous layer; (4) the mucous membrane.\r\nThe =muscular coat= is of the striped variety as far as the base of the\r\nheart, where it rapidly changes to the unstriped type. In addition to\r\nthis change, the muscular coat becomes much thicker and firmer, while\r\nthe lumen is diminished.[86] The outer fibers are arranged\r\nlongitudinally, beginning in two bundles attached in the interval\r\nbetween the arytenoid and cricoid cartilages. The inner fibers run in\r\ntwo spiral strata to the terminal part of the tube, where the\r\narrangement is an outer longitudinal and an inner circular layer.[87]\r\nThe =mucous membrane= is pale, and is covered with squamous stratified\r\nepithelium. It is loosely attached to the muscular coat by an abundant\r\nsubmucosa, and lies in longitudinal folds which obliterate the lumen\r\nexcept during deglutition.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Carotid, broncho-œsophageal, and gastric arteries.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Vagus, glosso-pharyngeal, and sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY\r\n\r\nThe abdominal cavity (Cavum abdominis) is the largest of the body\r\ncavities. It is separated from the thoracic cavity by the diaphragm and\r\nis continuous behind with the pelvic cavity.\r\n\r\nIt is ovoid in form but somewhat compressed laterally. Its long axis\r\nextends obliquely from the center of the pelvic inlet to the sternal\r\npart of the diaphragm. Its dorso-ventral diameter is greatest at the\r\nfirst lumbar vertebra, while its greatest transverse diameter is a\r\nlittle nearer the pelvis.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal wall= or roof is formed by the lumbar vertebræ, the lumbar\r\nmuscles, and the lumbar part of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral walls= are formed by the oblique and transverse abdominal\r\nmuscles, the abdominal tunic, the anterior parts of the ilia, the\r\ncartilages of the asternal ribs, and the parts of the posterior ribs\r\nwhich are below the attachment of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral wall= or floor consists of the two recti, the aponeuroses\r\nof the oblique and transverse muscles, the abdominal tunic, and the\r\nxiphoid cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior wall= is formed by the diaphragm, which is very deeply\r\nconcave, thus greatly increasing the size of the abdomen at the expense\r\nof the thorax.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It should be noted that the diaphragm also concurs practically in the\r\n  formation of a considerable part of the lateral walls, since its\r\n  costal portion even during ordinary inspiration lies directly on the\r\n  ribs over a width of four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.); in\r\n  expiration this area of contact would be about twice as wide,\r\n  including about all of the fleshy rim. This fact is of clinical\r\n  importance, with reference to auscultation and percussion, and\r\n  penetrating wounds. The cupola of the diaphragm extends as far forward\r\n  as a plane through the sixth intercostal space to the right of the\r\n  heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no wall between the abdominal and pelvic cavities. The line of\r\ndemarcation here is the =terminal line= (Linea terminalis) or brim of\r\nthe pelvis; it is formed by the base of the sacrum, the ilio-pectineal\r\nlines, and the anterior borders of the pubic bones.\r\n\r\nThe muscular walls are lined by a layer of fascia, distinguished in\r\ndifferent parts as: (1) the diaphragmatic fascia; (2) the transversalis\r\nfascia; (3) the iliac fascia; (4) the deep layer of the lumbo-dorsal\r\nfascia.\r\n\r\nThe subperitoneal or extraperitoneal connective tissue (Tela subserosa)\r\nunites the fascia and peritoneum. It is composed of areolar tissue, more\r\nor less loaded with fat according to the condition of the subject,\r\nexcept over the diaphragm. It sends laminæ into the various peritoneal\r\nfolds.\r\n\r\nThe peritoneum, the serous membrane which lines the cavity, will be\r\ndescribed later.\r\n\r\nThe abdominal walls are pierced in the adult by =five apertures=. These\r\nare: the three openings in the diaphragm which transmit the aorta,\r\nposterior vena cava, and the œsophagus; the inguinal canals, which\r\ncontain the spermatic cord or the round ligament (in female carnivora).\r\nIn the fœtus there is the umbilical opening also.\r\n\r\nThe cavity contains the greater part of the digestive and urinary\r\norgans, part of the internal generative organs, numerous nerves,\r\nblood-vessels, lymph vessels and glands, ductless glands (spleen and\r\nadrenal bodies), and certain fœtal remains.\r\n\r\nFor topographic purposes the abdomen is divided into nine regions by\r\nimaginary planes.[88] Two of these planes are sagittal, and two are\r\ntransverse. The sagittal planes cut the middles of the inguinal\r\n(Poupart’s) ligaments; the transverse planes pass through the last\r\nthoracic and fifth lumbar vertebræ, or the lower end of the fifteenth\r\nrib and the external angle of the ilium respectively. The transverse\r\nplanes divide the abdomen into three zones, one behind the other, viz.,\r\n=epigastric=, =mesogastric=, and =hypogastric=: these are subdivided by\r\nthe sagittal planes as indicated in the subjoined table.\r\n\r\n            Left parachondriac Xiphoid   Right parachondriac\r\n            Left lumbar        Umbilical Right lumbar\r\n            Left iliac         Prepubic  Right iliac.\r\n\r\nOther useful regional terms are: sublumbar, diaphragmatic, inguinal. The\r\nfirst two require no explanation. The inguinal regions (right and left)\r\nlie in front of the inguinal (Poupart’s) ligament. The flank is that\r\npart of the lateral wall which is formed only of soft structures. The\r\ndepression on its upper part is termed the paralumbar fossa.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PERITONEUM[89]\r\n\r\nThe peritoneum is the thin serous membrane which lines the abdominal and\r\n(in part) the pelvic cavity, and covers to a greater or less extent the\r\nviscera contained therein. In the male it is a completely closed sac,\r\nbut in the female there are two small openings in it; these are the\r\nabdominal orifices of the Fallopian tubes, which at their other ends\r\ncommunicate with the uterus, and so indirectly with the exterior. The\r\nperitoneal cavity is only a potential one, since its opposing walls are\r\nnormally separated only by the thin film of serous fluid (secreted by\r\nthe membrane) which acts as a lubricant.\r\n\r\nThe free surface of the membrane has a glistening appearance and is very\r\nsmooth. This is due to the fact that this surface is formed by a layer\r\nof flat endothelial cells, and is moistened by the peritoneal fluid.\r\nFriction is thus reduced to a minimum during the movements of the\r\nviscera. The outer surface of the peritoneum is related to the\r\nsubperitoneal tissue, which attaches it to the abdominal wall or the\r\nviscera.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the general disposition of the peritoneum, we may\r\nimagine the abdominal cavity to be empty and lined by a simple layer of\r\nperitoneum, termed the =parietal layer= (Lamina parietalis). We may\r\nregard the organs as beginning to develop in the subperitoneal tissue,\r\nenlarging, and migrating into the cavity to a varying extent. In doing\r\nso they carry the peritoneum before them, producing introversion of the\r\nsimple sac, and forming folds which connect them with the wall or with\r\neach other. The viscera thus receive a more or less complete covering of\r\nperitoneum, termed the =visceral layer= (Lamina visceralis). The\r\nconnecting folds are termed =omenta=, =mesenteries=, =ligaments=, etc.\r\nThey contain a varying quantity of connective tissue, fat and lymph\r\nglands, and furnish a path for the vessels and nerves of the viscera.\r\nSome contain unstriped muscular tissue. An omentum is a fold which\r\npasses from the stomach to other viscera. There are three of these,\r\nnamely: (1) the =small= or =gastro-hepatic omentum= (Omentum minus),\r\nwhich passes from the lesser curvature of the stomach to the liver; (2)\r\nthe =gastro-splenic omentum= (Ligamentum gastrolienale), which extends\r\nfrom the greater curvature of the stomach to the spleen; (3) the =great\r\nomentum= (Omentum majus), which passes from the greater curvature of the\r\nstomach and from the spleen to the terminal part of the great colon and\r\nthe origin of the small colon. It does not pass directly from one organ\r\nto the other, but forms an extensive loose sac (Figs. 278, 279). A\r\n=mesentery= (Mesenterium) is a fold which attaches the intestine to the\r\ndorsal wall of the abdomen. There are two mesenteries, namely: (1) the\r\n=great mesentery= which connects the greater part of the small intestine\r\nwith the dorsal abdominal wall; (2) the =colic mesentery=, which\r\nattaches the small colon to the dorsal abdominal wall. =Ligaments= are\r\nfolds which pass between viscera other than parts of the digestive tube,\r\nor connect them with the abdominal wall. The term is also applied to\r\nfolds which attach parts of the digestive tract to the abdominal wall,\r\nbut do not contain their blood-vessels and nerves. In some cases (_e.\r\ng._, the lateral and coronary ligaments of the liver) they are\r\nstrengthened by fibrous tissue; in other cases (_e. g._, the broad\r\nligaments of the uterus) they contain also unstriped muscular tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PELVIC CAVITY\r\n\r\nThe pelvis is the posterior part of the trunk. It incloses the pelvic\r\ncavity (Cavum pelvis), which communicates in front with the abdominal\r\ncavity, the line of demarcation being the pelvic brim or terminal line.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal wall= or roof is formed by the sacrum and first three\r\ncoccygeal vertebræ. The =lateral walls= are formed by the parts of the\r\nilia behind the ilio-pectineal lines and the sacro-sciatic ligaments.\r\nThe =ventral wall= or floor is formed by the pubic and ischial bones.\r\nThe boundary of the =outlet= is formed by the third coccygeal vertebra\r\ndorsally, the ischial arch ventrally, and the posterior edges of the\r\nsacro-sciatic ligaments and the semimembranosus muscles laterally. The\r\noutlet is closed by the perineal fascia; this consists of superficial\r\nand deep layers, which are attached around the margin of the outlet and\r\ncentrally to the organs at the outlet—the anus and its muscles, the\r\nvulva (in the female), and the root of the penis (in the male).\r\n\r\nThe cavity contains the rectum, parts of the internal generative and\r\nurinary organs, some fœtal remnants, muscles, vessels, and nerves. It is\r\nlined by the fascia pelvis, and in part by the peritoneum.\r\n\r\nThe =pelvic peritoneum= is continuous in front with that of the abdomen.\r\nIt lines the cavity as far back as the third or fourth sacral vertebra\r\nin the horse, where it is reflected on to the viscera, and from one\r\norgan to another. We may therefore distinguish an anterior, peritoneal,\r\nand a posterior, retroperitoneal part of the cavity. Along the\r\nmid-dorsal line it forms a continuation of the colic mesentery, the\r\n=mesorectum=, which attaches the first or peritoneal part of the rectum\r\nto the roof. In animals in fair condition a considerable quantity of\r\nsubperitoneal and retroperitoneal fat is found on the walls and in the\r\nvarious interstices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 256.—DIAGRAM OF SAGITTAL SECTION OF MALE PELVIS TO SHOW\r\n    DISPOSITION OF PERITONEUM.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Pouch between rectum and roof of cavity, continuous laterally\r\n    with _b_, recto-genital pouch; _c_, vesico-genital pouch; _d_, pouch\r\n    below bladder and its lateral ligaments. The lateral line of\r\n    reflection of the peritoneum is dotted. The area of rectum covered\r\n    by peritoneum varies widely. When the rectum is empty, the\r\n    reflection dorsally may be at the posterior end of the sacrum; when\r\n    the rectum is very full, the reflection may occur a short distance\r\n    behind the promontory.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 257.—SCHEMATIC CROSS-SECTIONS TO SHOW ARRANGEMENT OF PELVIC\r\n    PERITONEUM OF HORSE: A, IN MALE; B, IN FEMALE.\r\n\r\n  _A_: _a_, _b_, Recto-genital pouch, _c_, _c_, vesico-genital pouch;\r\n    _d_, _d_, pouch below bladder and its lateral ligaments; _1_,\r\n    mesorectum; _2_, _2_, urogenital fold; _3_, _3_, lateral, _4_,\r\n    median ligaments of bladder; _v. d._, vas deferens; _u. m._, uterus\r\n    masculinus. _B_: _a_, _b_, recto-genital pouch; _c_, _c_,\r\n    vesico-genital pouch; _d_, _d_, pouch below bladder and its lateral\r\n    ligaments; _1_, mesorectum; _2_, _2_, broad ligaments of uterus;\r\n    _3_, _3_, lateral, _4_, median ligaments of bladder.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the male the general disposition of the peritoneum here is as\r\nfollows. If traced along the dorsal wall, it is reflected at the third\r\nor fourth sacral vertebra on to the rectum, forming the visceral\r\nperitoneum for the first part of that tube. Laterally it is reflected in\r\na similar fashion. If the rectum be raised, it will be seen that the\r\nperitoneum passes from its ventral surface and forms a transverse fold\r\nwhich lies on the dorsal surface of the bladder (Fig. 272). This is the\r\n=urogenital fold= (Plica urogenitalis). Its concave free edge passes on\r\neither side into the inguinal canal. The ventral layer of this fold is\r\nreflected on to the dorsal surface of the bladder near its neck. Thus\r\nthere is formed a pouch between the rectum and bladder—the\r\n=recto-vesical pouch= (Excavatio recto-vesicalis), which is partially\r\nsubdivided by the urogenital fold into recto-genital and vesico-genital\r\ncavities. The fold contains the vasa deferentia, part of the vesiculæ\r\nseminales, and the uterus masculinus (a fœtal remnant). The space on\r\neither side of the rectum is occupied by coils of the small colon and\r\nthe pelvic flexure of the great colon usually. If the bladder is now\r\nraised, it is seen that the peritoneum passes from its ventral surface\r\non to the pelvic floor, forming a median fold, the so-called =middle\r\nligament= (Plica umbilicalis media). It also forms on each side a\r\nlateral fold, the =lateral ligament= (Plica umbilicalis lateralis),\r\nwhich contains in its edge the so-called =round ligament= (Ligamentum\r\nteres)—the partially occluded umbilical artery, which is a large vessel\r\nin the fœtus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 258.—STOMACH OF HORSE, PARIETAL SURFACE, WITH FIRST PART OF\r\n    DUODENUM.\r\n\r\n  Fixed _in situ_ when full but not distended. The larger branches of\r\n    the anterior gastric artery with two satellite veins are shown.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the female the arrangement is modified by the presence of the uterus;\r\nthe urogenital fold is very large, so as to inclose the uterus and a\r\nsmall part of the vagina. It forms two extensive folds, the =broad\r\nligaments of the uterus= (Ligamenta lata uteri), which attach that organ\r\nto the sides of the pelvic cavity and the lumbar part of the abdominal\r\nwall (Fig. 271). It thus divides the recto-vesical pouch completely into\r\ndorsal and ventral compartments—the =recto-genital pouch= (Excavatio\r\nrecto-uterina), and the =vesico-genital= pouch (Excavatio\r\nvesico-uterina).\r\n\r\nFurther details will be given in the description of the pelvic viscera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE STOMACH\r\n\r\nThe stomach (Ventriculus) is the large dilatation of the alimentary\r\ncanal between the œsophagus and the small intestine. It is a sharply\r\ncurved, U-shaped sac, the right branch being, however, much shorter than\r\nthe left one. The convexity is directed ventrally. When moderately\r\ndistended, there is often a slight constriction which indicates the\r\ndivision into right and left sacs. It is relatively small, and is\r\nsituated in the dorsal part of the abdominal cavity behind the diaphragm\r\nand liver, mainly to the left of the median plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 259.—STOMACH OF HORSE, VISCERAL SURFACE, WITH FIRST PART OF\r\n    DUODENUM.\r\n\r\n  Fixed _in situ_ when full but not distended. The posterior gastric\r\n    artery and its larger branches with two satellite veins are shown.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt presents for description two surfaces, two curvatures, and two\r\nextremities. The =parietal surface= (Facies parietalis) is convex and is\r\ndirected forward, upward, and toward the left; it lies against the\r\ndiaphragm and liver. The =visceral surface= (Facies visceralis), also\r\nconvex, faces in the opposite direction; it is related to the terminal\r\npart of the large colon, the pancreas, the small colon, and the small\r\nintestine. The =lesser curvature= (Curvatura minor) is very short,\r\nextending from the termination of the œsophagus to the junction with the\r\nsmall intestine. When the stomach is _in situ_, its walls are here in\r\ncontact, and the cardia and pylorus close together. The =greater\r\ncurvature= (Curvatura major) is very extensive. From the cardia it is\r\nfirst directed upward and curves over the left extremity; it then\r\ndescends, passes to the right, crosses the median plane, and curves\r\nupward to end at the pylorus. Its left portion is related to the spleen,\r\nwhile its ventral portion rests on the left divisions of the great\r\ncolon. The =left extremity= or =saccus cæcus= is a rounded cul-de-sac\r\nwhich lies under the upper ends of the fourteenth, fifteenth, and\r\nsixteenth ribs and the diaphragm.[90] It is related to the pancreas\r\nbehind and the base of the spleen externally. The =right= or =pyloric\r\nextremity= is much smaller and is continuous with the duodenum, the\r\njunction being indicated by a marked constriction. It lies on the liver,\r\na little to the right of the median plane, and a little lower than the\r\ncardiac opening. About two or three inches (ca. 5 to 8 cm.) from the\r\npylorus there is a constriction which marks off the =antrum pylori= from\r\nthe rest of the right sac. The =œsophageal orifice= or =cardia= is\r\nsituated at the left extremity of the lesser curvature, but about eight\r\nto ten inches (ca. 20 to 25 cm.) from the left extremity. The œsophagus\r\njoins the stomach very obliquely. The opening is closed by the sphincter\r\ncardiæ and numerous folds of mucous membrane. The =pyloric orifice=\r\ncommunicates with the duodenum. Its position is indicated externally by\r\na distinct constriction. Internally it presents a circular ridge\r\nproduced by a ring of muscular tissue—the =sphincter pylori=.\r\n\r\nThe stomach is held in position mainly by the pressure of the\r\nsurrounding viscera and by the œsophagus. The following peritoneal folds\r\nconnect it with the adjacent parts:\r\n\r\n1. The =gastro-phrenic ligament= (Lig. gastrophrenicum) connects the\r\ngreat curvature, from the cardia to the left extremity, with the crura\r\nof the diaphragm. This leaves a narrow area uncovered with peritoneum,\r\nand here the stomach is attached to the diaphragm by loose connective\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\n2. The =small= or =gastro-hepatic omentum= (Omentum minus) connects the\r\nlesser curvature and the first part of the duodenum with the liver below\r\nthe œsophageal notch and the portal fissure.\r\n\r\n3. The =gastro-splenic omentum= (Lig. gastrolienale) passes from the\r\nleft part of the great curvature to the hilus of the spleen.\r\n\r\n4. The =great= or =gastro-colic omentum= (Omentum majus) connects the\r\nventral part of the great curvature and the first curve of the duodenum\r\nwith the terminal part of the great colon and the initial part of the\r\nsmall colon.\r\n\r\n5. The =gastro-pancreatic fold= (Plica gastro-pancreatica) extends from\r\nthe left sac above the cardia to the duodenum. It is attached dorsally\r\nto the liver and vena cava, ventrally to the pancreas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 260.—EVERTED STOMACH OF HORSE FROM WHICH THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE HAS\r\n    BEEN REMOVED.\r\n\r\n  _O_, Œsophagus; _D_, duodenum; _b_, circular layer; _c′_, internal\r\n    oblique fibers; _c″_, loop around cardia; _c‴_, transition of\r\n    internal to external oblique fibers; _d_, fibers connecting the two\r\n    branches of the cardiac loop; _p_, antral sphincter; _p′_, pyloric\r\n    sphincter. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe stomach of the equidæ is relatively small, its capacity varying from\r\ntwo to four gallons (ca. 8 to 15 liters).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The size, form, and position of the stomach are subject to\r\n  considerable variation. When the stomach is nearly empty the saccus\r\n  cæcus contains only gas and is strongly contracted; the middle portion\r\n  (physiological fundus) contains the ingesta and preserves its rounded\r\n  character, while the pyloric portion is contracted. When distended the\r\n  middle portion settles down some four or five inches, pushing back\r\n  coils of the small colon and small intestine which may lie between the\r\n  great curvature and the large colon, and also pushing to the left or\r\n  right the left dorsal part of the great colon; the spleen, small\r\n  colon, and small intestines are pushed back by the distention of the\r\n  left sac.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The wall is composed of four coats—serous, muscular,\r\nsubmucous, and mucous.\r\n\r\nThe =serous coat= (Tunica serosa) covers the greater part of the organ\r\nand is closely adherent to the muscular coat except at the curvatures.\r\nIt partially bridges over the lesser curvature, and covers here elastic\r\ntissue which assists in retaining the bent form of the stomach. The\r\nperitoneal folds have been described.\r\n\r\nThe =muscular coat= consists of three incomplete layers, an external of\r\nlongitudinal, a middle of circular, and an internal of oblique fibers.\r\nThe layer of =longitudinal fibers= (Stratum longitudinale) is very thin\r\nand exists only along the curvatures and at the antrum. At the lesser\r\ncurvature it is continuous with the longitudinal fibers of the\r\nœsophagus. On the antrum pylori it forms a well developed complete\r\nlayer. The layer of =circular fibers= (Stratum circulare) exists only on\r\nthe right sac. At the pyloric orifice it forms a thick ring—the =pyloric\r\nsphincter=. Another ring, the antral sphincter, is found at the left end\r\nof the antrum pylori. The =oblique fibers= (Fibræ obliquæ) are arranged\r\nin two layers; the external stratum covers the left sac and is a\r\ncontinuation (in part) of the longitudinal fibers of the œsophagus; the\r\ninternal stratum is found also on the left sac, and exchanges fibers\r\nwith the circular and external oblique layers. It forms a remarkable\r\nloop around the cardiac orifice, constituting a powerful =cardiac\r\nsphincter= (Sphincter cardiæ).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 261.—FRONTAL SECTION OF STOMACH AND FIRST PART OF DUODENUM OF\r\n    HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _C_, Cardiac orifice. Photograph of specimen fixed _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =submucous coat= is a layer of loose connective tissue which\r\nconnects the muscular and mucous coats; in it the vessels and nerves\r\nramify before entering the mucosa.\r\n\r\nThe =mucous coat= is clearly divided into two parts. That which lines\r\nthe left sac resembles the œsophageal mucous membrane, and is termed\r\n=œsophageal= or =cuticular=. It is white in color, destitute of glands,\r\nand covered with a thick, squamous, stratified epithelium. At the\r\ncardiac orifice it presents numerous folds which occlude the\r\nopening.[91] It terminates abruptly at an elevated, denticulated,\r\nsinuous line, termed the =cuticular ridge= (Margo plicatus). Below and\r\nto the right of this line the mucous membrane has a totally different\r\ncharacter, being soft and velvety to the touch, and covered by a mucoid\r\nsecretion. It is glandular, and three zones may be recognized, although\r\nno sharp line of demarcation exists. A narrow zone next to the cuticular\r\nridge has a yellowish-gray color, and contains short tubular =cardiac\r\nglands= (Cardiac gland region). Next to this is a large area which has a\r\nmottled reddish-brown color, and contains =fundus glands= (fundus gland\r\nregion). This part of the mucous membrane is thick and very vascular,\r\nand corresponds to the fundus of the stomach in man and the dog. The\r\nremainder of the mucous membrane has a reddish-gray color and contains\r\nbranched, tubular, =pyloric glands= (pyloric gland region); it\r\ncorresponds to the pyloric portion of man and the dog.\r\n\r\nThe folding of the stomach wall at the lesser curvature produces a\r\nprominent ridge which projects into the cavity of the stomach. Circular\r\nridges occur at the antral and pyloric sphincters.\r\n\r\n=Blood-vessels and Nerves.=—The stomach receives blood from all the\r\nbranches of the cœliac artery. The gastric veins drain into the portal\r\nvein. The nerves are derived from the vagus and sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 262.—DIAGRAM OF ZONES OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF STOMACH OF HORSE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SMALL INTESTINE\r\n\r\nThe =small intestine= (Intestinum tenue) is the tube which connects the\r\nstomach with the large intestine. It begins at the pylorus and\r\nterminates at the lesser curvature of the cæcum. Its average length is\r\nabout seventy feet (ca. 22 meters). When distended its diameter varies\r\nfrom two to four inches (5 to 10 cm.). Its capacity is about twelve\r\ngallons (40 to 50 liters).\r\n\r\nIt is clearly divisible into a =fixed= and a =mesenteric= or floating\r\nportion. The fixed portion is termed the duodenum, while the mesenteric\r\nportion (Intestinum tenue mesenteriale) is arbitrarily divided into\r\nparts termed the jejunum and ileum.[92]\r\n\r\nThe =duodenum= is about three to four feet (ca. 1 to 1.25 m.) long. Its\r\nshape is somewhat like a horseshoe, the convexity being directed toward\r\nthe right. The =first part= is directed to the right and forms an\r\nᔕ-shaped curve. The convexity of the first part of the curve is dorsal,\r\nof the second ventral. It lies on the middle and right lobes of the\r\nliver, and presents two dilatations (Ampullæ) with a constriction\r\nbetween them. The duodenal angle or head of the pancreas lies in the\r\nconcavity of the second curve, and here, five to six inches (ca. 12 to\r\n15 cm.) from the pylorus, the pancreatic duct and the bile-duct pierce\r\nthe bowel wall. The =second part= passes upward and backward on the\r\nright lobe of the liver and, on reaching the right kidney and the base\r\nof the cæcum, it curves toward the median plane, opposite the last rib.\r\nThe =third part= passes almost transversely from right to left behind\r\nthe base of the cæcum, crosses the median plane under the third and\r\nfourth lumbar vertebræ, and turns forward to become continuous with the\r\njejunum under the left kidney. The sacculations of the first part have a\r\ndiameter of three to four inches (ca. 7.5 to 10 cm.).\r\n\r\nIt is attached by a short peritoneal fold termed the =mesoduodenum=.\r\nThis fixes the first part of the duodenum closely to the liver and the\r\nright dorsal part of the colon; the remainder is somewhat less closely\r\nattached by it to the cæcum and right kidney, the sublumbar muscles, and\r\n(more closely) to the terminal part of the great colon and the first\r\npart of the small colon.[93]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 263.—TOPOGRAPHY OF VISCERA OF HORSE, LEFT VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1.R._, First thoracic vertebra; _1.L._, first lumbar vertebra;\r\n    _2.K._, second sacral spine; _S._, scapula; _A._, humerus; _St._,\r\n    sternum; _B._, ilium; _O._, femur; _L._, lung in complete\r\n    expiration; _l._, dotted line indicating contour of lung in\r\n    inspiration; _H_, pericardium; _Z_, costal part of diaphragm; _Z′_,\r\n    tendinous center of diaphragm; _l.N._, left kidney; _l.v.C._, left\r\n    ventral colon; _v.Q._, sternal flexure of colon; _d.Q._,\r\n    diaphragmatic flexure of colon; _D._, small intestine; _M._, small\r\n    colon; _M′_, rectum; _a_, coccygeus muscle; _b_, retractor ani; _c_,\r\n    _c_, sphincter ani externus; _d_, constrictor vulvæ; _e_,\r\n    sacro-coccygeus inferior; _f_, anterior gluteal artery; _g_,\r\n    internal pudic artery; _h_, abdominal wall in section. (After\r\n    Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas, reduced.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =jejunum= and =ileum= together (Jejuno-ileum) constitute the\r\nmesenteric or floating portion of the small intestine. No distinct point\r\nexists at which to make the demarcation. With the exception of the last\r\ntwo or three feet, the mesenteric part of the intestine varies so much\r\nin position that only a general statement can be made. It lies in\r\nnumerous coils (Ansæ) mingled with those of the small colon, chiefly in\r\nthe dorsal part of the left half of the abdomen, from the visceral\r\nsurface of the stomach to the pelvis. It may insinuate itself between\r\nthe left portions of the colon and the abdominal wall; also between the\r\nventral portions of the colon, reaching the floor of the abdomen. The\r\nterminal part of the intestine (ileum) ascends almost vertically, a\r\nlittle to the right of the median plane, to open into the cæcum at the\r\nlesser curvature of its base. The average diameter of the jejuno-ileum\r\nis about two and a half to three inches (ca. 6 to 7 cm.). In the cadaver\r\none finds most of the tube presenting irregular constricted and dilated\r\nparts. The last three or four feet (ca. 1 meter) are usually tightly\r\ncontracted, resembling somewhat the terminal part of the œsophagus. This\r\npart may be termed the ileum.\r\n\r\nThe mesenteric part is connected with the dorsal abdominal wall by the\r\n=great mesentery=. This is a wide fan-shaped fold, consisting of two\r\nlayers of peritoneum, between which the vessels and nerves reach the\r\nbowel; it also contains the mesenteric lymph glands and some fat. The\r\nvisceral border of the mesentery contains the intestine, while the\r\nparietal border or =root= (Radix mesenterii) is attached to a small area\r\naround the great mesenteric trunk under the first and second lumbar\r\nvertebræ. The root is thick, as it contains a large number of vessels\r\nand nerves placed close together. The mesentery is short at first, but\r\nsoon reaches a length of one and a half to two feet (ca. 50\r\ncm.)—sufficient to allow coils of the intestine to reach the abdominal\r\nfloor, the pelvic cavity, or even to descend into the scrotum through\r\nthe inguinal canal. Near its termination the intestine (ileum) leaves\r\nthe border of the mesentery, so that the latter has a free edge which\r\npasses to the cæcum.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The wall consists of four coats—serous, muscular,\r\nsubmucous, and mucous, enumerated from without inward.\r\n\r\nThe =serous coat= is complete except at the mesenteric edge, where the\r\nvessels and nerves reach the bowel.\r\n\r\nThe =muscular coat= consists of an outer longitudinal and an inner\r\ncircular layer, the latter being the thicker. In the last few feet of\r\nthe intestine the muscular coat is very thick, and being usually firmly\r\ncontracted in the dead subject, gives the impression that this part of\r\nthe bowel is of smaller caliber; such, however, is not the case during\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 264.—DIAGRAM OF SECTION OF DIVERTICULUM DUODENI OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  Solid line indicates mucous membrane.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =submucous coat= is a layer of areolar tissue in which the vessels\r\nand nerves ramify. It contains also the duodenal glands and the bases of\r\nthe solitary glands and Peyer’s patches.\r\n\r\nThe =mucous membrane= is soft and velvety. It has a grayish or\r\nyellowish-red color and is very vascular. About five or six inches from\r\nthe pylorus it forms a pouch, the =diverticulum duodeni=, in which the\r\npancreatic and hepatic ducts open. On a small papilla opposite this is\r\nthe termination of the accessory pancreatic duct. At the ileo-cæcal\r\nopening the mucous membrane projects slightly into the cavity of the\r\ncæcum, forming the =ileo-cæcal valve=. The free surface is thickly beset\r\nwith villi, small projections of the mucous membrane which can be seen\r\nwell by placing a piece of the membrane in water. They are relatively\r\nshort and thick and have a distinct neck in the horse. Each contains a\r\ncentral lymph vessel (lacteal), and around this a plexus of capillaries,\r\nlymphoid tissue, and unstriped muscle-fibers. They are important agents\r\nin absorption from the contents of the intestine. The epithelium is\r\ncolumnar, with many goblet cells. Underneath the basement membrane is a\r\nlayer of unstriped muscle-fibers, the =muscularis mucosæ=.\r\n\r\nThe glands of the small intestine are of three kinds:\r\n\r\n1. The =intestinal glands= (Glandulæ intestinales Lieberkuehni) are\r\nfound throughout. They are simple tubular glands which open between the\r\nvilli.\r\n\r\n2. The =duodenal glands= (Glandulæ duodenales Brunneri) are found in the\r\nfirst twenty feet (ca. 6 meters) of the bowel. They are racemose glands,\r\nand are situated in the submucosa, so that their ducts perforate the\r\nmuscularis mucosæ and the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n3. The =lymph follicles= (Noduli lymphatici) are found either scattered\r\nor in groups. In the former case they are termed =solitary glands=\r\n(Noduli lymphatici solitarii), in the latter =Peyer’s patches= (Noduli\r\nlymphatici aggregati). The solitary glands are about the size of a\r\nmillet-seed or a small sago grain. Peyer’s patches are situated chiefly\r\nalong the surface opposite to the mesenteric attachment and begin about\r\nthree or four feet from the pylorus. They number one to two hundred, and\r\nare usually one to two inches (2 to 5 cm.) long and a quarter of an inch\r\nto one-half inch (ca. 2 to 14 mm.) wide. Larger ones occur in the\r\nterminal part, where one patch may have a length of seven to fifteen\r\ninches (ca. 17 to 38 cm.) and a width of half an inch to one inch (ca. 5\r\nto 25 mm.) in young horses (Ellenberger). They undergo atrophy in old\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 265.—PEYER’S PATCHES OF SMALL INTESTINE OF HORSE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =arteries= of the small intestine come from\r\nthe cœliac and anterior mesenteric arteries. The =veins= go to the\r\nportal vein. The =lymph vessels= are numerous and go to the mesenteric\r\nlymph glands. The =nerves= are derived from the vagus and sympathetic\r\nthrough the solar plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE LARGE INTESTINE\r\n\r\nThe large intestine (Intestinum crassum) extends from the termination of\r\nthe ileum to the anus. It is about twenty-five feet (ca. 7.5 to 8 in.)\r\nin length. It differs from the small intestine in its greater size, in\r\nbeing sacculated, for the most part, possessing longitudinal bands, and\r\nhaving a more fixed position. It is divided into cæcum, great colon,\r\nsmall colon, and rectum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE CÆCUM\r\n\r\nThe =cæcum= (Intestinum cæcum) is a great cul-de-sac intercalated\r\nbetween the small intestine and the colon. It has a remarkable size,\r\nshape, and position in the horse. Its length is three to four feet (ca.\r\n1 to 1.25 m.), and its capacity about seven to eight gallons (ca. 25 to\r\n30 liters). It is conical in form, and is curved somewhat like a\r\nreversed comma. It is situated almost entirely to the right of the\r\nmedian plane, extending from the right iliac and sublumbar regions to\r\nthe abdominal floor behind the xiphoid cartilage. Both extremities are\r\nblind, and the two orifices are placed close together on the concave\r\ncurvature. It presents for description a base, a body, and an apex.\r\n\r\nThe =base= (Saccus cæcus) extends from about the thirteenth intercostal\r\nspace backward almost to the pelvic inlet. Its greater curvature is\r\ndorsal, its lesser ventral; connected with the latter are the\r\ntermination of the ileum and the origin of the colon. The =body= (Corpus\r\ncæci) extends downward and forward from the base and rests largely on\r\nthe ventral wall of the abdomen. Its lesser curvature is about parallel\r\nwith the costal arch and about five to six inches (10 to 15 cm.) below\r\nit. The =apex= (Apex cæci) lies usually on the abdominal floor about a\r\nhand’s length behind the xiphoid cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe base is attached dorsally by connective tissue and peritoneum on the\r\nventral surface of the pancreas and right kidney, the psoas muscles, and\r\nthe iliac fascia; internally, it is attached to the terminal part of the\r\ngreat colon, and ventrally to the origin of the great colon. The body is\r\nattached dorsally to the first part of the colon by the cæco-colic fold.\r\nThe apex is free, and consequently may vary in position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 266.—DIAGRAM OF CÆCUM AND LARGE COLON OF HORSE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cæcum has four =longitudinal bands= (Tæniæ), situated on the dorsal,\r\nventral, right, and left surfaces; these cause four rows of\r\n=sacculations= (Haustra). The ventral band is entirely exposed or free\r\n(Tænia libera); the dorsal band is free on the apex. The cæcal arteries\r\nare placed on the other two. The right or parietal surface of the cæcum\r\nis related chiefly to the right abdominal wall, the diaphragm, duodenum,\r\nand liver. The left or visceral surface lies against the left divisions\r\nof the colon, the root of the great mesentery, and the small intestine.\r\n\r\nThe =ileo-cæcal orifice= (Ostium ileocæcale) is situated in the lesser\r\ncurvature of the base, about four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) to\r\nthe right of the median plane and about opposite the lower end of the\r\nlast rib. The end of the ileum is partially telescoped into the cæcum,\r\nso that the orifice is surrounded by a fold of mucous membrane, forming\r\nthe =ileo-cæcal valve= (Valvula ileocæcalis). The peritoneum and\r\nlongitudinal muscle-fibers do not take part in its formation.\r\n\r\nThe =cæco-colic orifice= (Ostium cæcocolicum) is placed above and\r\nexternal to the preceding one; the interval between them is only about\r\ntwo inches (ca. 5 cm.), and they are separated by a distinct ridge which\r\nprojects into the interior of the cæcum. The orifice is slit-like and is\r\nsmall in relation to the size of the cæcum and colon. It has a =valvular\r\nfold= (Valvula cæcocolica) at its lower margin and a =muscular ring=\r\n(Sphincter cæci). Large crescentic or semilunar folds (Plicæ cæci)\r\nproject into the cavity of the bowel, and between these are large\r\npouches (Cellulæ cæci).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 267.—TOPOGRAPHY OF VISCERA OF HORSE, RIGHT VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1 R._, First thoracic vertebra; _1 L._, first lumbar vertebra; _2\r\n    K._, second sacral spine; _S._, scapula; _A._, humerus; _St._,\r\n    sternum; _B._, ilium; _O._, femur; _L._, right lung; _H._,\r\n    pericardium; _Z._, diaphragm (pars costalis); _r.v.C._, right\r\n    ventral colon; _v.Q._, sternal flexure of colon; _d.Q._,\r\n    diaphragmatic flexure of colon; _C._, body of cæcum; _C′._, base of\r\n    cæcum; _C″._, apex of cæcum; _D._, small intestine; _F._, pelvic\r\n    flexure of colon; _M._, rectum; _a._, abdominal wall in section;\r\n    _b_, duodenum; _c_, coccygeus muscle; _d_, retractor ani; _e_, _e′_,\r\n    sphincter ani externus; _f_, anterior gluteal artery; _g_, internal\r\n    pudic artery; _h_, xiphoid cartilage.

(After P. Schumann.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =great colon= (Colon crassum) begins at the cæco-colic orifice, and\r\nterminates by joining the small colon behind the saccus cæcus of the\r\nstomach. It is ten to twelve feet (ca. 3 to 3.7 m.) long, and its\r\naverage diameter (exclusive of its narrowest part) is about eight to ten\r\ninches (ca. 20 to 25 cm.). Its capacity is more than double that of the\r\ncæcum. When removed from the abdomen, it consists of two parallel\r\nportions, which are connected by peritoneum and partially by areolar\r\ntissue also. _In situ_, it is folded so that it consists of four parts,\r\nwhich are designated according to their position or numerically. The\r\nthree bent connecting parts are termed the flexures. The first, =right\r\nventral part= (Colon ventrale dextrum), begins at the cæco-colic orifice\r\nabout opposite the middle of the last rib, passes downward and forward\r\nalong the right costal arch, and reaches the floor of the abdomen. Over\r\nthe xiphoid cartilage it bends sharply to the left and backward, forming\r\nthe =sternal flexure= (Flexura diaphragmatica ventralis). The second,\r\n=left ventral part= (Colon ventrale sinistrum), passes backward on the\r\nleft part of the abdominal floor, and, on reaching the pelvic inlet,\r\nbends sharply dorsally and forward, forming the =pelvic flexure=\r\n(Flexura pelvina). This is continued by the third, =left dorsal part=\r\n(Colon dorsale sinistrum), which passes forward above the left ventral\r\nportion. On reaching the stomach, diaphragm, and left lobe of the liver,\r\nit turns to the right, forming the =diaphragmatic= or =gastro-hepatic\r\nflexure= (Flexura diaphragmatica dorsalis). The fourth or =right dorsal\r\npart= (Colon dorsale dextrum) passes backward above the first portion,\r\nand on reaching the inner or left surface of the base of the cæcum it\r\nturns upward and to the left behind the left sac of the stomach; here it\r\nbecomes constricted, and joins the small colon below the left kidney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 269.—ABDOMINAL VISCERA OF HORSE, VENTRAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The ventral wall and part of the lateral walls of the abdomen are\r\n    removed. _C_, Cæcum; _r.v.C._, right ventral part of colon; _v.Q._,\r\n    sternal flexure of colon; _l.v.C._, left ventral part of colon;\r\n    _d.Q._, diaphragmatic flexure of colon; _D_, small intestine; _M_,\r\n    small colon; _a_, ventral free band of cæcum; _b_, inner band of\r\n    cæcum; _c_, lateral band of ventral part of colon; _d_, ventral band\r\n    of ventral part of colon; _e_, point of elbow; _f_, anterior end of\r\n    sternal region; _g_, xiphoid cartilage; _h_, teats. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =caliber= of the great colon varies greatly at different points. At\r\nits origin it is only about two to three inches (ca. 5 to 7.5 cm.) in\r\ndiameter. This soon increases to about eight to ten inches (ca. 20 to 25\r\ncm.) for the ventral portions. Beyond the pelvic flexure the diameter is\r\nreduced to about three or four inches (ca. 8 to 9 cm.). Near the\r\ndiaphragmatic flexure the caliber rapidly increases, and reaches its\r\nmaximum in the last division, where it may be about twenty inches (50\r\ncm.) in its widest part. This is succeeded by a somewhat funnel-shaped\r\nterminal contraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 270.—TOPOGRAPHY OF VISCERA OF HORSE, RIGHT SIDE, DEEPER VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1.R._, First thoracic vertebra; _1.L._, first lumbar vertebra; _2.\r\n    K._, second sacral spine; _S_, scapula; _A_, humerus; _B_, ilium;\r\n    _O._, femur; _Sch._, pubis; _Si._, ischium; _St._, sternum; _L._,\r\n    right lobe of liver; _r.N._, right kidney; _C._, body, _C′._, base,\r\n    _C″._, apex of cæcum; _r.v.C._, right ventral colon; _v.Q._, sternal\r\n    flexure of colon; _d.Q._, diaphragmatic flexure of colon; _r.d.C._,\r\n    right dorsal colon; _F._, pelvic flexure of colon; _D._, small\r\n    intestine; _H._, urinary bladder; _M._, rectum; _a_, left ventricle;\r\n    _a′_, right ventricle; _b_, _b′_, right coronary artery; _c_, left\r\n    atrium; _c′_, right atrium; _d_, small (left) coronary vein; _e_,\r\n    vena azygos; _f_, anterior vena cava; _g_, posterior vena cava; _h_,\r\n    sinus venosus; _i_, right phrenic nerve; _k_, right vagus, with its\r\n    dorsal (_k′_) and ventral (_k″_) divisions; _l_, aorta; _m_,\r\n    œsophagus; _n_, trachea; _o_, diaphragm (median section); _p_, right\r\n    lateral ligament of liver; _q_, duodenum; _r_, dotted line\r\n    indicating position in median section of diaphragm in inspiratory\r\n    phase; _s_, recto-coccygeus; _t_, suspensory ligament of rectum;\r\n    _u_, sphincter ani; _v_, vesicula seminalis; _w_, prostate; _x_,\r\n    bulbo-urethral (Cowper’s) gland; _y_, urethra; _z_, abdominal wall;\r\n    _z′_, xiphoid cartilage. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas,\r\n    reduced.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe first part of the great colon is attached to the lesser curvature of\r\nthe cæcum by two layers of peritoneum which form the =cæco-colic fold=.\r\nThe ventral parts of the colon are similarly connected to the dorsal\r\nparts of the same side by the mesocolon. The right portions are united\r\nalso by areolar tissue and muscular fibers, the surface of contact being\r\nabout four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) wide; the left portions are\r\nattached to each other by a peritoneal fold wide enough to allow them to\r\nbe drawn apart five or six inches (ca. 12 to 15 cm.) near the pelvic\r\nflexure. The terminal part of the colon is attached by peritoneum and\r\nareolar tissue to the ventral surface of the pancreas dorsally and to\r\nthe base of the cæcum externally. It is connected indirectly with the\r\ndiaphragm and liver by means of a fold derived from the right lateral\r\nligament of the liver.\r\n\r\nThe =relations= are complex, but the more important facts are as\r\nfollows: The ventral portions (first and second) have extensive contact\r\nwith the abdominal wall ventrally and laterally. On the right side the\r\ncolon is almost entirely excluded from contact with the flank by the\r\ncæcum; on the left side it has no contact with the upper part of the\r\nflank, being excluded here by coils of the small colon and small\r\nintestine. Dorsally the chief relations are to the stomach, duodenum,\r\nliver, pancreas, small colon, small intestine, aorta, vena cava, and\r\nportal vein. Since there are no transverse attachments of the right and\r\nleft portions, and the latter have no attachment to the wall, they are\r\nsubject to considerable displacement.[94] The pelvic flexure is variable\r\nin position, but usually it is directed to the right across the pelvic\r\ninlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 271.—TOPOGRAPHY OF VISCERA OF HORSE, LEFT DEEP VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1R._, First thoracic vertebra; _1L._, first lumbar vertebra; _2K._,\r\n    second sacral spine; _S._, scapula; _A._, humerus; _B._, ilium;\r\n    _F._, femur; _Sch._, pubis; _Si._, ischium; _L._, liver (left lobe);\r\n    _Ma._, stomach, the posterior contour of which is indicated by\r\n    dotted line _x_; _Mi._, spleen; _l.N._, left kidney, concealed part\r\n    indicated by dotted line; _M._, small colon; _D._, small intestine,\r\n    parts of which have been removed; _l. d.

(After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ventral portions of the colon have four longitudinal =muscular\r\nbands= (Tæniæ) which produce four rows of sacculations (Haustra). On the\r\nfirst part the external and internal bands are free; the dorsal band is\r\ncovered by the adhesion to the overlying dorsal division, while the\r\nventral band is largely covered by the adhesion to the cæcum. On the\r\nleft ventral part the external and ventral bands are free; of the two\r\ndorsal bands, the inner one is concealed by the mesocolon, the outer one\r\nis chiefly free. The pelvic flexure has a band on its lesser curvature,\r\nwhich is continued on to the third part, concealed by the peritoneal\r\nattachment; these parts are practically non-sacculated. Near the\r\ndiaphragmatic flexure two other bands appear, so that the flexure has\r\nthree bands; two of these are dorsal and free, the third is ventral and\r\nconcealed. The last part has three bands, of which the inner and outer\r\nones are free, the ventral one covered.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE SMALL COLON\r\n\r\nThe =small colon= (Colon tenue) begins at the termination of the great\r\ncolon, behind the saccus cæcus of the stomach and below the left kidney,\r\nand is continued by the rectum at the pelvic inlet. Its length is about\r\nten to twelve feet (ca. 3.5 m.), and its diameter about three to four\r\ninches (ca. 7.5 to 10 cm.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 272.—PELVIC INLET AND POSTERIOR PART OF ABDOMINAL WALL OF HORSE,\r\n    VIEWED FROM THE FRONT.\r\n\r\n  The left inguinal canal is partially opened.

(After Ellenberger-Baum,\r\n    Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIts coils lie in the space between the stomach and the pelvic inlet,\r\ndorsal to the left portions of the great colon. They are mingled with\r\nthose of the small intestine, from which they are easily distinguished\r\nby the tæniæ and sacculation.\r\n\r\nIt is attached to the sublumbar region by the =colic mesentery=, and to\r\nthe termination of the duodenum by a short peritoneal fold (Lig.\r\nduodeno-colicum). The great omentum is also attached to the origin of\r\nthe bowel. The colic mesentery is narrow at its origin, but soon reaches\r\na width of about three feet (ca. 80 to 90 cm.). Its parietal border is\r\nattached along a line extending from the ventral surface of the left\r\nkidney to the sacral promontory; it is continuous in front with the root\r\nof the great mesentery, and behind with the mesorectum.\r\n\r\nThere are two =tæniæ= and two rows of sacculations. Of the tæniæ, one is\r\nfree, the other concealed by the mesentery. When the bowel is hardened\r\n_in situ_ its lumen between the pouches is reduced to a narrow slit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE RECTUM\r\n\r\nThe =rectum= (Intestinum rectum) is the terminal part of the bowel; it\r\nextends from the pelvic inlet to the anus.[95] Its length is about one\r\nfoot (ca. 30 cm.). Its direction may be straight or oblique. The first\r\nor =peritoneal part= of the rectum is like the small colon, and is\r\nattached by a continuation of the colic mesentery termed the\r\n=mesorectum=. The second or =retroperitoneal part= forms a flask-shaped\r\ndilatation termed the =ampulla recti=; it is attached to the surrounding\r\nstructures by connective tissue and muscular bands.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the rectum is related to the small colon and the\r\npelvic flexure of the great colon. It is frequently deflected to the\r\nleft by the latter. The second part of the rectum is related dorsally\r\nand laterally to the pelvic wall. Ventrally the relations differ in the\r\ntwo sexes. In the male they are the bladder, the terminal parts of the\r\nvasa deferentia, the vesiculæ seminales, the prostate, the\r\nbulbo-urethral (Cowper’s) glands, and the urethra. In the female they\r\nare the uterus, vagina, and vulva.[96]\r\n\r\n=Structure of the Large Intestine.=—The =serous coat= covers the\r\ndifferent parts in varying degrees. It does not cover (_a_) the opposed\r\nsurfaces of the cæcum and colon which are between the layers of the\r\ncæco-colic fold and mesocolon; (_b_) the areas of attachment of the\r\ncæcum and colon to the pancreas, right kidney, and sublumbar region;\r\n(_c_) the second part of the rectum.\r\n\r\nThe =muscular coat= consists of longitudinal and circular fibers. The\r\nbulk of the former is in the bands already described. Some of the\r\ncircular fibers pass from one part of the colon to another, where they\r\nare attached to each other, forming the fibræ transversæ coli. The\r\nmuscular coat of the second part of the rectum presents special\r\nfeatures. The longitudinal layer of fibers is very thick and consists of\r\nlarge bundles, loosely united. A large band, the =recto-coccygeus=, is\r\ndetached from it on either side, and passes upward and backward to be\r\ninserted into the fourth and fifth coccygeal vertebræ.\r\n\r\nThe =submucous tissue= is abundant in the wall of the rectum, so that\r\nthe mucous membrane is loosely attached to the muscular coat, and forms\r\nnumerous folds when the bowel is empty.\r\n\r\nThe =mucous membrane= of the large intestine is thicker and darker in\r\ncolor than that of the small intestine. It forms large crescentic or\r\nsemilunar folds corresponding to the external constrictions. It has no\r\nvilli, Brunner’s glands, or Peyer’s patches. The =intestinal glands= (of\r\nLieberkühn) are large and numerous. =Solitary glands= are also numerous,\r\nespecially at the apex of the cæcum and in the left dorsal part of the\r\ncolon.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Greater and lesser mesenteric and internal pudic\r\narteries. The veins go to the portal vein.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Mesenteric plexus of the sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\nThe =anus= is the terminal orifice of the alimentary canal. It is\r\nsituated below the root of the tail, where it forms a round projection,\r\nwith a central depression when contracted. It is covered externally by\r\nan integument which is thin, hairless, and provided with numerous\r\nsebaceous and sweat glands. The mucous lining is pale, glandless, and\r\ncovered with a thick, squamous, stratified epithelium.\r\n\r\nThere are three muscles of the anus.\r\n\r\n1. The =sphincter ani internus= is merely a terminal thickening of the\r\ncircular coat of the bowel.\r\n\r\n2. The =sphincter ani externus= is a broad band of striped muscle-fibers\r\noutside the internal sphincter. Some fibers are attached to the\r\ncoccygeal fascia above, others to the perineal fascia below. Its action\r\nis to close the anus.\r\n\r\n3. The =retractor ani= (M. levator ani) is a flat muscle which lies\r\nbetween the rectum and the sacro-sciatic ligament. It arises from the\r\nsuperior ischiatic spine and the sacro-sciatic ligament, and ends under\r\nthe external sphincter. Its action is to reduce the partial prolapse\r\nwhich the anus undergoes during defecation.\r\n\r\nThe suspensory ligament of the anus is a band of unstriped muscle which\r\narises from the first coccygeal vertebra, passes downward over the\r\nretractor, and unites with its fellow below the anus. In the male it is\r\nlargely continued by the retractor penis muscle; in the female it blends\r\nwith the constrictor vulvæ. It may act as an accessory sphincter of the\r\nanus.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Internal pudic artery.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Hæmorrhoidal and perineal nerves (for the sphincter ani\r\nexternus and retractor ani).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PANCREAS\r\n\r\nThe =pancreas= is situated transversely on the dorsal wall of the\r\nabdomen, the greater part being to the right of the median plane. Its\r\ncentral part lies under the sixteenth and seventeenth thoracic vertebræ.\r\n\r\nWhen fresh it has a reddish cream color, but if left in the unpreserved\r\ncadaver it rapidly decomposes and becomes dark. It resembles the\r\nsalivary glands in appearance, but is softer, and its lobules are more\r\nloosely united. Its average weight is about twelve ounces (ca. 350 g.).\r\n\r\nWhen hardened in situ its shape is very irregular. It is triangular in\r\noutline, and presents for description two surfaces, three borders, and\r\nthree angles.[97]\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal surface= faces upward and forward. It is partially covered\r\nby peritoneum. It is related chiefly to the ventral surface of the right\r\nkidney and adrenal, the posterior vena cava, the portal vein, the cœliac\r\nartery and its divisions, the gastro-phrenic ligament and the saccus\r\ncæcus of the stomach, the right and caudate lobes of the liver, and the\r\ngastro-pancreatic fold. There are grooves for the divisions of the\r\ncœliac artery, and a large one for the splenic vein.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral surface= looks downward and backward; it is in general\r\nconcave. It presents two impressions, separated by an oblique ridge. The\r\nsmaller of these (Impressio cæcalis) lies to the right, and is caused by\r\nthe pressure of the base of the cæcum; the larger one (Impressio colica)\r\nindicates the area of contact with the terminal part of the great colon\r\nand its junction with the small colon. It has usually no peritoneal\r\ncovering except over a small area at the anterior angle.\r\n\r\nThe =right border= is nearly straight; it is related to the second part\r\nof the duodenum and the caudate lobe of the liver.\r\n\r\nThe =left border= is slightly concave, and is related to the first part\r\nof the duodenum, the left sac of the stomach, and the splenic vessels.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior border= presents a deep notch to the right of the median\r\nplane for the portal vein, which passes through the gland very\r\nobliquely. There is a thin bridge of gland tissue dorsal to the vein,\r\nthus forming the =portal ring= (Annulus portarum). The root of the great\r\nmesentery is in contact with the border just to the left of the median\r\nplane.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior= or =duodenal angle= (Caput pancreatis) is attached to the\r\nconcavity of the second curve of the duodenum, and the adjacent part of\r\nthe right lobe of the liver. The ducts leave at this extremity.\r\n\r\nThe =left= or =splenic angle= (Cauda pancreatis) corresponds to the tail\r\nof the pancreas in man. It is in contact with the base of the spleen,\r\nthe left kidney and adrenal body, and the saccus cæcus of the stomach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 273.—PANCREAS OF HORSE WITH CHIEF RELATIONS, VENTRAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The pancreatic duct and its two chief radicles are indicated by dotted\r\n    lines, since they are in the substance of the gland.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =right angle= is rounded, and lies on the ventral surface of the\r\nright kidney and adrenal body.\r\n\r\nThe pancreas is attached dorsally by connective tissue to the kidneys\r\nand adrenal bodies, the gastro-phrenic ligament and the suspensory\r\nligament of the spleen, the posterior vena cava, the portal fissure, and\r\nthe gastro-pancreatic fold. The ventral surface is mainly attached by\r\nareolar tissue to the base of the cæcum and the terminal part of the\r\ngreat colon.\r\n\r\nThere are almost invariably two =ducts=. The large one is termed the\r\n=pancreatic duct= (Ductus pancreaticus [Wirsungi]). It is formed by the\r\nunion of two radicles which come from the right and left extremities,\r\nand passes through the duodenal angle to end at the duodenal\r\ndiverticulum alongside of the bile-duct. The duct is nearly half an inch\r\n(ca. 1 cm.) wide, and is very thin-walled. It is situated in the\r\nsubstance of the gland near its dorsal surface; none of it is free. The\r\n=accessory pancreatic duct= (Ductus pancreaticus accessorius\r\n[Santorini]) arises either from the chief duct or its left radicle, and\r\nends on a papilla in the duodenum opposite the chief duct.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The pancreas belongs to the class of tubulo-alveolar\r\nglands, the alveoli being long, like those of the duodenal glands; in\r\nother respects it resembles the serous salivary glands very closely. It\r\nhas no proper capsule and the lobules are rather loosely united.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The arteries of the pancreas come from the\r\nbranches of the cœliac and anterior mesenteric arteries. The nerves are\r\nderived from the cœliac and mesenteric plexuses of the sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LIVER\r\n\r\nThe =liver= (Hepar) is the largest gland in the body. It is situated\r\nobliquely on the abdominal surface of the diaphragm. Its highest point\r\nis at the level of the right kidney, its lowest on the left side,\r\nusually about three or four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) from the abdominal\r\nfloor, opposite the lower end of the seventh or eighth rib. The greater\r\npart of it lies to the right of the median plane.\r\n\r\nIt is red-brown in color and is rather friable. Its average weight is\r\nabout ten to twelve pounds (ca. 5 kg.). When in the body, or if hardened\r\n_in situ_, it is strongly curved and accurately adapted to the abdominal\r\nsurface of the diaphragm. When removed in the soft state, it flattens\r\nout into a cake-like form quite different from its natural\r\nconfiguration. It presents for description two surfaces and a\r\ncircumference, which may be divided into four borders.\r\n\r\nThe =parietal surface= (Facies diaphragmatica) is strongly convex, and\r\nlies against the diaphragm. It faces chiefly upward and forward. It\r\npresents, just to the right of the median plane, a sagittal groove for\r\nthe posterior vena cava (Fossa venæ cavæ). The vein is partially\r\nembedded in the substance of the gland, and receives the hepatic veins.\r\n\r\nThe =visceral surface= (Facies visceralis) faces in general downward and\r\nbackward; it is concave and irregular, being moulded on the organs which\r\nlie against it. It presents, a little to the right of the median plane,\r\nthe =portal fissure= (Porta hepatis). Through this the portal vein,\r\nhepatic artery, and hepatic plexus of nerves enter, and the hepatic duct\r\nand lymph vessels leave the liver. The portal or hepatic lymph glands\r\nare also found here. The pancreas is attached at and to the right of the\r\nfissure, and the gastro-hepatic omentum to the left of it. Above the\r\nfissure is a ridge which represents the caudate lobe (Lobus caudatus\r\nSpigelii), and is continued to the right by the pointed caudate process\r\n(Processus caudatus). Further to the left there is a large depression\r\n(Impressio gastrica) for the stomach. To the right of this may be seen a\r\ngroove passing to the right and dorsally; this is the duodenal\r\nimpression (Impressio duodenalis). Ventral to these is a large\r\ndepression for the great colon (Impressio colica). Dorsal to this is a\r\nsmaller depression for the blind end of the base of the cæcum.[98] Coils\r\nof the small intestine may also lie on this surface, and the apex of the\r\nspleen may reach to it when the stomach is empty.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal border= (Margo obtusus) is thick for the most part. It\r\npresents from right to left: (1) a depression for the right kidney\r\n(Impressio renalis); (2) a notch, which is the dorsal end of the fossa\r\nvenæ cavæ; (3) a deep notch (Impressio œsophagea) which is mainly\r\noccupied by the thick margin of the œsophageal opening of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral border= is thin, and is marked by two deep =interlobar\r\nfissures= or =incisures= (Incisuræ interlobares), which partially divide\r\nthe organ into three principal =lobes=—=right=, =middle=, and =left=.\r\nThe right lobe is the largest, except in old subjects, in which it is\r\nfrequently much atrophied. The middle lobe is the smallest. It is marked\r\nby several small fissures, and by the =umbilical fissure= (Incisura\r\numbilicalis); the latter contains the umbilical vein in the fœtus, which\r\nis transformed into the round ligament after birth.\r\n\r\nThe =right border= is thin and long. It is nearly vertical, and extends\r\nbackward to about the middle of the sixteenth rib.\r\n\r\nThe =left border= is thin and short. It extends backward to a point\r\nopposite the lower part of the ninth or tenth rib. The ventral and\r\nlateral borders together constitute the margo acutus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 274.—LIVER OF YOUNG HORSE, HARDENED _in situ_, PARIETAL SURFACE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe liver is held in position largely by the pressure of the other\r\nviscera and by its close application to the diaphragm. It has six\r\nligaments.\r\n\r\n1. The =coronary ligament= (Lig. coronarium hepatis) attaches it closely\r\nto the diaphragm. It consists of two laminæ. The right one is attached\r\nto the right of the fossa venæ cavæ; the left one begins to the left of\r\nthe vena cava and passes upward and outward, becoming continuous with\r\nthe left lateral ligament at the left margin of the œsophageal notch; it\r\ndetaches a middle fold which extends to the notch and is continuous with\r\nthe small omentum. The two laminæ unite below the vena cava to form the\r\nnext ligament.\r\n\r\n2. The =falciform ligament= (Lig. falciforme hepatis) is a crescentic\r\nfold which attaches the middle lobe to the sternal part of the diaphragm\r\nand to the abdominal floor for a variable distance. In its concave free\r\nedge is found.\r\n\r\n3. The =round ligament= (Lig. teres hepatis), a fibrous cord which\r\nextends from the umbilical fissure to the umbilicus; it is the vestige\r\nof the umbilical vein, which in the fœtus carries the blood from the\r\nplacenta to the liver.\r\n\r\n4. The =right lateral ligament= (Lig. triangulare dextrum) is a wide\r\nfold which attaches the dorsal border of the right lobe to the costal\r\npart of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 275.—LIVER OF HORSE, VISCERAL SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  Specimen from middle-aged subject, hardened _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n5. The =left lateral ligament= (Lig. triangulare sinistrum) attaches the\r\ndorsal edge of the left lobe to the tendinous center of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n6. The =hepato-renal= or =caudate ligament= (Lig. hepatorenale) attaches\r\nthe caudate process to the right kidney and the base of the cæcum. The\r\ngastro-hepatic omentum and the mesoduodenum have been described.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the liver is divided by fissures into three principal\r\nlobes—right, middle, and left. The right lobe is the largest in the\r\nyoung subject and is irregularly quadrilateral in form. On its dorsal\r\npart is the caudate lobe, which ends in a pointed process directed\r\noutward, and assists in forming the cavity for the right kidney. The\r\nmiddle lobe is normally much the smallest. The left lobe is oval in\r\noutline and thickest centrally. In old or middle-aged subjects it often\r\nexceeds the right one in size. In some cases the atrophy of the right\r\nlobe is so extreme that the middle lobe may exceed it in size.[99]\r\n\r\nThe =hepatic duct= (Ductus hepaticus) is formed at the ventral part of\r\nthe portal fissure by the union of right and left chief lobar ducts. It\r\nis two or three inches (ca. 5 to 8 cm.) long and about half an inch (ca.\r\n1 to 1.5 cm.) wide. It passes between the two layers of the lesser\r\nomentum, and pierces the wall of the duodenum about five or six inches\r\n(ca. 12 to 15 cm.) from the pylorus, alongside of the pancreatic duct.\r\nThe ducts pass obliquely through the wall of the duodenum for about half\r\nan inch (ca. 1 cm.) before opening into the diverticulum duodeni. The\r\narrangement forms an effective valve, which prevents regurgitation from\r\nthe intestine. There is no gall-bladder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 276.—LIVER OF NEW-BORN FOAL, HARDENED _in situ_. VISCERAL\r\n    SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  The differences, when compared with the organ in the adult, are very\r\n    striking.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The liver is covered by an outer serous, and an inner\r\nfibrous coat. The =serous coat= covers the gland except at the\r\nattachment of the pancreas and at the portal fossa; it is reflected from\r\nit to form the ligaments and the lesser omentum. The =fibrous capsule=\r\nis in general thin; it sends laminæ into the ligaments, and also\r\ndelicate strands into the gland substance. At the portal fissure it is\r\nabundant and surrounds the vessels and ducts, which it accompanies in\r\nthe portal canals of the gland substance.\r\n\r\nThe gland substance is composed of the parenchyma and the interstitial\r\ntissue. The =parenchyma= is made up of lobules, 1 to 2 mm. in diameter,\r\nwhich are held together by a small amount of interlobular connective\r\ntissue. On account of the very small amount of the latter, the\r\nlobulation of the horse’s liver is not usually at all distinct to the\r\nnaked eye; for the same reason the organ is also quite friable.[100]\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =portal vein= enters at the portal fissure. It\r\nconveys blood from the digestive tract and the spleen, which contains\r\nvarious products of digestion and numerous white blood-cells. The\r\n=hepatic artery= also enters at the portal fissure; it may be termed the\r\nnutrient vessel. All the blood is returned from the liver to the\r\nposterior vena cava by the hepatic veins. The portal vein and the\r\nhepatic artery both divide into interlobular branches, which run\r\ntogether in the portal canals of the interlobular tissue. The branches\r\nof the portal vein (Venæ interlobulares) give off intralobular branches\r\nwhich form plexuses of capillaries in the lobules and give rise to a\r\ncentral vein (Vena centralis). The branches of the hepatic artery (Rami\r\narteriosi interlobulares) are of relatively small size. They supply\r\nmainly (if not exclusively) the interlobular tissue, the capsule, and\r\nthe walls of the vessels and ducts. The =hepatic veins=[101] (Venæ\r\nhepaticæ) empty into the vena cava as it lies in the fossa of the gland.\r\nTheir ultimate radicles are the central lobular veins, which emerge from\r\nthe bases of the lobules and join the sublobular veins (Venæ\r\nsublobulares); the latter unite to form the hepatic veins. The largest\r\nhepatic veins, three or four in number, join the posterior vena cava\r\njust before it leaves the liver to pass through the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe nerve-supply comes from the =hepatic plexus=, composed of branches\r\nfrom the vagus and sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE SPLEEN\r\n\r\nThe =spleen= (Lien) is the largest of the ductless glands.[102] It is\r\nsituated chiefly in the left parachondrium, in close relation to the\r\nleft part of the great curvature of the stomach, to which its long axis\r\ncorresponds. Its size and weight vary greatly in different subjects, and\r\nalso in the same subject under different conditions, depending chiefly\r\non the great variability of the amount of blood contained in it. The\r\naverage weight is about 35 ounces (ca. 1 kg.), its length about 20\r\ninches (ca. 50 cm.), and its greatest width about 8 to 10 inches (ca. 20\r\nto 25 cm.). It is usually bluish-red or somewhat purple in color. In the\r\nnatural state it is soft and yielding, but not friable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The weight appears to vary ordinarily from about one to eight pounds,\r\n  although in large horses the latter figure even may be exceeded\r\n  without any apparent evidence of disease. There does not seem to be\r\n  any constant relation to the body-weight. For example, the spleen of a\r\n  colt about ten months old weighed three and a half pounds, while it\r\n  often weighs less than two pounds in horses weighing 1000 to 1200\r\n  pounds. The chief variation in outline consists of increase of width,\r\n  especially of the dorsal part.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt extends obliquely in a curved direction from the left crus of the\r\ndiaphragm and the saccus cæcus of the stomach to the ventral third of\r\nthe ninth or tenth rib. It presents for description two surfaces, two\r\nborders, and two extremities.\r\n\r\nThe =parietal= or =external surface= (Facies parietalis) is convex, and\r\nlies chiefly against the diaphragm, but is in direct contact with the\r\nupper parts of the last two ribs and to a small extent with the flank at\r\nthe lumbo-costal angle.\r\n\r\nThe =visceral= or =internal surface= (Facies visceralis) is in general\r\nconcave. It is divided into two unequal portions by a longitudinal\r\nridge; on this is a groove, the =hilus=, in which the vessels and nerves\r\nare situated. The area in front of the ridge (Facies gastrica) is\r\nmoulded on the great curvature of the stomach; it is about two inches\r\n(ca. 5 cm.) wide. The area behind the ridge (Facies intestinalis) is\r\nmuch more extensive; it is related chiefly to the small colon, the small\r\nintestine, and the great omentum. It may be marked by one or two\r\nfissures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 277.—SPLEEN OF HORSE, HARDENED _in situ_. VISCERAL SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  The area marked intestinal impression is related to the first coil of\r\n    the small colon.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =anterior border= (Margo anterior) is concave and thin.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior border= (Margo posterior) is convex and thin.\r\n\r\nThe =base= or =dorsal extremity= is beveled, and fits into the interval\r\nbetween the left kidney and the left crus of the diaphragm and the psoas\r\nmajor. When hardened _in situ_, it shows an impression (Facies renalis)\r\nwhere it lies against the kidney. The left extremity of the pancreas\r\ntouches it also. The anterior basal angle fits in between the saccus\r\ncæcus of the stomach and the left kidney; the posterior basal angle\r\nusually lies against the flank just behind the last rib.\r\n\r\nThe =apex= or =ventral extremity= is small; it lies—when the stomach is\r\nnot full—between the left lobe of the liver and the left dorsal portion\r\nof the colon; when the stomach is full, the spleen is pushed further\r\nback and loses contact with the liver.\r\n\r\nThe spleen is attached by two peritoneal folds, the suspensory ligament\r\nand the gastro-splenic omentum. The =suspensory ligament= (Lig.\r\nsuspensorium lienis) attaches the base to the left crus of the diaphragm\r\nand the left kidney; it contains a quantity of elastic tissue. The part\r\nwhich passes to the diaphragm is the ligamentum phrenico-lienale, and\r\nblends with the gastro-phrenic ligament; the part which goes to the\r\nkidney is termed the ligamentum renolienale. The =gastro-splenic\r\nomentum= (Lig. gastrolienale) passes from the hilus to the left part of\r\nthe great curvature of the stomach. It is narrow above, where it joins\r\nthe suspensory ligament; below it becomes much wider and is continuous\r\nwith the great omentum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Small globular or lenticular masses of splenic tissue may be found in\r\n  the gastro-splenic omentum. They are termed =accessory spleens=\r\n  (Lienes accessoriæ).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The spleen has an almost complete =serous coat=. Subjacent\r\nto this and intimately united with it is a =capsule= of fibrous tissue\r\n(Tunica albuginea), which contains many elastic fibers and some\r\nunstriped muscular tissue. Numerous =trabeculæ= (Trabeculæ lienis) are\r\ngiven off from the deep face of the capsule and ramify in the substance\r\nof the organ to form a supporting network. In the interstices of this\r\nframework is the =spleen pulp= (Pulpa lienis), a dark red, soft, grumous\r\nmaterial. This is supported by a delicate adenoid =reticulum=, and\r\ncontains numerous leukocytes, the large splenic cells, red\r\nblood-corpuscles, and pigment. The pulp is richly supplied with blood.\r\nThe branches of the splenic artery enter at the hilus and pass along the\r\ntrabeculæ. The arteries which enter the pulp have a sheath of lymphoid\r\ntissue, which collects on the vessel wall at certain points, forming\r\nsmall =lymph nodules=, the so-called Malpighian corpuscles (Noduli\r\nlymphatici lienales). These are visible to the naked eye as white spots,\r\nabout as large as the head of a pin. The blood passes into cavernous\r\nspaces lined by endothelium which is continuous with the cells of the\r\nreticulum of the pulp. From these the veins arise. The splenic vein runs\r\nin the hilus in company with the artery and nerves, and joins the\r\nposterior gastric vein to form a large radicle of the portal vein.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Splenic artery.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Splenic plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE PERITONEUM\r\n\r\nThe general disposition of the peritoneum has been described, and other\r\nfacts in regard to it were mentioned in the description of the viscera.\r\nIt is now desirable to study it as a continuous whole.[103] (Figs. 256,\r\n257, 278, 279.)\r\n\r\nWe may consider the peritoneum as consisting of two sacs—a greater and a\r\nlesser. The =greater sac= lines the greater part of the abdominal\r\ncavity, and covers most of the viscera which have a peritoneal\r\ninvestment. The =lesser sac= is an introversion or recess of the greater\r\nsac, formed during the development of the viscera. The two sacs\r\ncommunicate by a relatively narrow passage, termed the =epiploic\r\nforamen= of Winslow (Foramen epiploicum). This opening is situated on\r\nthe visceral surface of the liver above the portal fissure. It can be\r\nentered by passing the finger along the caudate lobe of the liver toward\r\nits root. Its dorsal (or anterior) wall is formed by the caudate lobe\r\nand the posterior vena cava. Its ventral (or posterior) wall consists of\r\nthe pancreas, the gastro-pancreatic fold, and the portal vein. The walls\r\nare normally in contact, and the passage merely a potential one. It is\r\nusually about four inches (ca. 10 cm.) in length. It is narrowest at the\r\nright extremity, where it is about an inch (ca. 2.5 to 3 cm.) wide.[104]\r\nIf the finger is passed into the foramen from right to left, it enters\r\nthe cavity of the lesser sac. If now an opening is made in the great\r\nomentum and the other hand introduced through it, the fingers of the two\r\nhands touch each other over the lesser curvature of the stomach. The\r\nformation and boundaries of the lesser sac should now be examined by\r\nspreading out the great omentum. It will be found that the latter now\r\nincloses a considerable cavity behind the stomach; this is termed the\r\n=omental cavity= (Bursa omentalis). Passing forward over the lesser\r\ncurvature of the stomach, we enter another space, the =vestibule= of the\r\nomental cavity (Vestibulum bursæ omentalis). This space is closed on the\r\nleft by the gastro-phrenic ligament, below and on the right by the\r\nlesser omentum, and dorsally by the gastro-pancreatic fold, which is\r\nattached to the dorsal border of the liver and to the posterior vena\r\ncava. Above the œsophageal notch the fingers can be passed around the\r\nborder of the liver and the vena cava till the coronary ligament is\r\nencountered. Thus the vestibule is closed except (1) on the right, where\r\nit communicates with the cavity of the greater sac by the epiploic\r\nforamen; and (2) behind, where it communicates with the cavity of the\r\nomentum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 278.—DIAGRAM OF GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF PERITONEUM (OF MARE) IN\r\n    SAGITTAL TRACING.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Pouch between rectum and roof of pelvis, continuous with _b_,\r\n    recto-genital pouch; _c_, vesico-genital pouch; _d_, pouch below\r\n    bladder and its lateral ligaments; _f_, lesser omentum; _Int._,\r\n    small intestine. The arrow points to the epiploic foramen (of\r\n    Winslow).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the great omentum has already been indicated.\r\nWe may now trace its line of attachment, which would correspond to the\r\nmouth of the sac. Beginning at the ventral part of the great curvature\r\nof the stomach, the line passes to the ventral face of the pylorus, then\r\ncrosses obliquely the first part of the duodenum to the point where the\r\npancreas is adherent to it. Here it passes to the anterior face of the\r\nterminal transverse part of the great colon, runs along this\r\ntransversely (from right to left), and continues for some ten or twelve\r\ninches (ca. 25 to 30 cm.) on the small colon. It then forms an acute\r\nangle, passes inward and forward along the small colon to the dorsal\r\npart of the hilus of the spleen, where it blends with the suspensory\r\nligament of the latter, and forms a recess (Recessus lienalis) behind\r\nthe saccus cæcus of the stomach. It now passes along the hilus of the\r\nspleen, and is continued to the great curvature of the stomach by the\r\ngastro-splenic omentum. It is convenient to regard the spleen as being\r\nintercalated in the left part of the great omentum; on this basis the\r\ngastro-splenic omentum would be that part of the great omentum which\r\nconnects the hilus of the spleen with the great curvature of the\r\nstomach. The great omentum is relatively small in the horse, and is\r\nusually not visible when the abdomen is opened. It is generally folded\r\nup in the space between the visceral surface of the stomach and the\r\nintestine.[105]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The lesser sac furnishes the peritoneal covering for: (1) the visceral\r\n  surface of the stomach and a small area of the first curve of the\r\n  duodenum; (2) a large part of the dorsal surface of the pancreas and\r\n  portal vein; (3) a small part of the visceral surface of the liver\r\n  above the attachment of the lesser omentum and the portal fossa; (4)\r\n  the posterior vena cava, from the level of the epiploic foramen [of\r\n  Winslow] to its passage through the diaphragm (in so far as it is not\r\n  embedded); (5) the part of the parietal surface of the liver between\r\n  the right and middle divisions of the coronary ligament; (6) the\r\n  corresponding part of the diaphragm, and the right part of the right\r\n  crus of the same; (7) part of the anterior surface of the terminal\r\n  part of the great colon, and the origin of the small colon; (8) the\r\n  left extremity of the pancreas (inconstant); (9) the spleen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe may now trace the peritoneum in a longitudinal direction, beginning\r\nin front. It is reflected from the ventral abdominal wall and the\r\ndiaphragm upon the liver, forming the ligaments and serous coat of the\r\ngland. It leaves the visceral surface of the liver as lesser omentum,\r\nand the crura of the diaphragm as the gastro-phrenic ligament, reaches\r\nthe saccus cæcus and lesser curvature of the stomach and the first curve\r\nof the duodenum, covers these organs, and is continued by the great\r\nomentum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 279.—DIAGRAM OF ABDOMINAL PERITONEUM IN FRONTAL (HORIZONTAL)\r\n    TRACING.\r\n\r\n  _D_, Duodenum. The arrow indicates the epiploic foramen (of Winslow).\r\n    By an oversight the leader line to the great omentum is omitted, and\r\n    the coronary ligament of the liver is erroneously marked lesser\r\n    omentum; the latter extends from liver to stomach, but is not\r\n    marked.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn the left it passes from the left crus of the diaphragm and the left\r\nkidney to form the suspensory ligament of the spleen, clothes that\r\norgan, and leaves it to be continued by the great omentum.\r\n\r\nOn the right it passes from the right crus of the diaphragm and the\r\ndorsal border of the liver to the concave border of the duodenum,\r\nforming the gastro-pancreatic fold (second part of the mesoduodenum),\r\nand covering part of the dorsal surface of the pancreas. From the margin\r\nof the pancreas, the right kidney, and a small area of the sublumbar\r\nregion behind the latter, it passes on to the base of the cæcum and the\r\nterminal part of the great colon. From these it passes on the right to\r\nthe duodenum, forming the third part of the mesoduodenum. On the left it\r\nclothes part of the ventral surface and the outer border of the left\r\nkidney, from which it passes to the base of the spleen, forming the\r\nventral layer of the suspensory ligament of the latter. Behind the\r\nterminal part of the great colon it is reflected around the great\r\nmesenteric artery to form the great mesentery. Behind this it is\r\nreflected almost transversely from the roof of the cavity and from the\r\norigin of the small colon on to the duodenum, forming the terminal part\r\nof the mesoduodenum. The line of origin of the colic mesentery begins on\r\nthe inner part of the ventral surface of the left kidney, and extends to\r\nthe sacral promontory, where the mesorectum begins. At the termination\r\nof the latter the peritoneum is reflected from the rectum on the dorsal\r\nand lateral walls of the pelvic cavity. Below the rectum it forms the\r\nurogenital fold, and passes on to the dorsal surface of the bladder,\r\ncovers its anterior part, and is reflected on to the body-wall laterally\r\nand ventrally, forming the lateral and middle ligaments of the bladder.\r\nIn the female the broad ligaments of the uterus replace the urogenital\r\nfold, with which they are homologous.\r\n\r\nIn the new-born foal certain folds are specially large. The falciform\r\nligament of the liver extends to the umbilical opening, and contains in\r\nits free edge the large umbilical vein. The bladder—at this time an\r\nabdominal organ—has a ventral median fold, which connects it and the\r\nurachus with the abdominal floor. This is flanked on either side by a\r\nfold which also extends to the umbilicus, and contains the large\r\numbilical artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF THE OX\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE MOUTH\r\n\r\nThe cavity of the mouth is shorter and wider than that of the horse, and\r\nthe vestibule is more capacious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 280.—ANTERIOR PART OF LOWER JAW OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _60_, Tip of tongue. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lips= are thick, wide, and comparatively immobile. The middle part\r\nof the upper lip and the surface between the nostrils is bare, and is\r\ntermed the muzzle (Planum nasolabiale). It is smooth, and (in health) is\r\nkept cool and moist by a clear fluid secreted by a layer of subcutaneous\r\nglands (Glandulæ nasolabiales) about half an inch (ca. 1.5 cm.) thick.\r\nIt shows irregular lines, mapping out small polygonal areas on which the\r\norifices of the gland-ducts are visible. A narrow bare strip also exists\r\nalong the edge of the lower lip. The remainder of the integument is\r\nprovided with ordinary and tactile hairs. The free edge and the lining\r\nmembrane present verrucose, horny papillæ. The labial glands form\r\ncompact masses near the angles of the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe =cheeks= are more capacious than in the horse. The mucous membrane\r\npresents large conical pointed =papillæ=, which are directed toward the\r\nfauces and are covered with a horny epithelium. The largest of these\r\nhave a length of about half an inch (ca. 1 to 1.5 cm.) and are situated\r\naround the angle of the mouth and parallel with the cheek teeth. The\r\norifice of the parotid duct is opposite the fifth upper cheek tooth. (In\r\nthe sheep and goat it is opposite the fourth tooth.) The =buccal= or\r\n=molar glands= are very well developed, and are arranged in three parts.\r\nThe dorsal row extends from the maxillary tuberosity to the angle of the\r\nmouth. Its lobules are of a light yellow color. The ventral part\r\nconsists of a compact brownish mass which reaches from the angle of the\r\nmouth a short distance under the masseter muscle. The middle part\r\nconsists of loosely arranged yellow lobules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 281.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF HEAD OF COW, CUT A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT\r\n    OF THE MEDIAN PLANE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cerebral hemisphere; _2_, corpus striatum; _3_, hippocampus; _4_,\r\n    olfactory bulb; _5_, corpora quadrigemina; _6_, optic nerve; _7_,\r\n    pons; _8_, medulla oblongata; _9_, spinal cord; _10_, pituitary\r\n    body; _11_, sphenoid sinus; _12_, lateral mass of ethmoid; _13_,\r\n    ventral straight muscles; _14_, pharyngeal (retropharyngeal) lymph\r\n    gland; _15_, longus colli; _16_, soft palate; _17_, vallate papillæ;\r\n    _18_, tonsillar sinus; _19_, conical papillæ of cheek; _20_,\r\n    hyo-epiglotticus muscle; _21_, epiglottis; _22_, hyo-glossus muscle;\r\n    _C1_, _C2_, atlas, axis.

Near these are found the openings of the\r\nsmall ducts of the sublingual gland. The papilla on which the\r\nsubmaxillary duct opens is wide, hard, and has a serrated edge.\r\n\r\nThe =hard palate= is wide, and is usually more or less pigmented. The\r\nbody of the premaxilla is covered with a thick layer of dense connective\r\ntissue, which has a thick, horny epithelial covering—forming the\r\nso-called dental plate or pad. The palatine ridges extend from this\r\nbackward about two-thirds of the length of the hard palate. They are\r\nnearly straight, and, for the most part, are serrated on the free edge.\r\nA median furrow extends between the ridges. The posterior third of the\r\npalate is smooth. Between the dental plate and the first ridge is the\r\ntriangular papilla incisiva; on either side of this is a deep furrow, in\r\nwhich is the oral opening of the =naso-palatine canal=. This canal is\r\ntwo inches or more (ca. 5 to 6 cm.) in length and opens on the floor of\r\nthe nasal cavity; it also communicates by a slit-like opening with the\r\norgan of Jacobson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 282.—CROSS-SECTION OF HEAD OF OX.\r\n\r\n  The section passes through the internal canthi. _L.a._, Lingual\r\n    arteries. The arrow indicates the communication between the\r\n    maxillary and palatine sinuses.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =soft palate= is somewhat shorter than that of the horse, but is\r\nlong enough to close the isthmus of the fauces. The posterior pillars do\r\nnot extend to the entrance of the œsophagus. The azygos muscle is much\r\nbetter developed than in the horse. The fibrous aponeurosis is for the\r\nmost part replaced by muscular tissue.\r\n\r\nThe =isthmus faucium= is wide and dilatable. On either side, behind the\r\nanterior pillar of the soft palate, is a deep depression, the =sinus\r\ntonsillaris=; external to this is the compact bean-shaped tonsil, which\r\nis about one to one and a half inches (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) in length. The\r\ntonsil does not project into the fauces, but outward instead: hence it\r\ndoes not occupy the tonsillar sinus, and is not visible internally, as\r\nis the case in most animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 283.—TONGUE OF OX, DORSAL ASPECT.\r\n\r\n  Pharynx, soft palate, and origin of œsophagus are cut dorsally and\r\n    reflected.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE TONGUE\r\n\r\nThe tongue of the ox is often variably pigmented. The root and body are\r\nwider than that of the horse, but the free part is more pointed. The\r\nposterior part of the dorsum forms a remarkable elliptical prominence,\r\nwhich is sharply defined in front. The filiform papillæ in front of this\r\nprominence are large and horny, with sharp points directed backward.\r\nThey impart to the tongue its rasp-like roughness. The papillæ on the\r\nprominence are large, broad and horny; some have a blunt conical form,\r\nothers are rounded or flattened. Behind the prominence, the papillæ are\r\nlong and soft, _i. e._, not horny. The fungiform papillæ are numerous\r\nand distinct; they are scattered more generally over the dorsum and\r\nedges of the free part. The vallate papillæ are about twenty or thirty\r\nin number; they are smaller than those of the horse, and are irregularly\r\ndistributed on either side of the posterior part of the prominence of\r\nthe dorsum. The foliate papillæ and the lingual fibrous cord are absent.\r\nThe muscles are well developed; the hyo-glossus arises by additional\r\nportions from the great and middle cornua of the hyoid bone. The tongue\r\nis highly protractile and is the chief organ of prehension.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE TEETH\r\n\r\nThe dental formula of the ox is:\r\n\r\n                         (   0   0   3   3 )\r\n                       2 ( I - C - P - M - ) = 32\r\n                         (   4   0   3   3 )\r\n\r\nThe =incisors= are absent from the upper jaw. There are eight incisors\r\nin the lower jaw, arranged in a somewhat fan-like manner. They are\r\nsimple teeth, without infundibulum. The crown is white, short, and\r\nshovel-shaped. The root is rounded, and is embedded in the jaw in such a\r\nmanner as to allow a considerable degree of movement. There is a\r\ndistinct =neck=. In addition to the simple numerical designation, the\r\nfollowing terms are commonly applied to the individual teeth: pinchers\r\nor central, first intermediate, second intermediate, and corner\r\nincisors. It is probable that the latter are much modified canines. The\r\nincisors of the ox do not advance out of the alveoli, as is the case in\r\nthe horse; in old age, however, the gum retracts so that the roots are\r\npartly exposed and may come into wear.[106]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 284.—INCISOR TEETH OF OX, LINGUAL ASPECT.\r\n\r\n  _C.s._, Caruncula sublingualis.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 285.—INCISOR TOOTH OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _24′_, Lingual surface of crown; _24″_, masticatory surface.

(After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =deciduous incisors= differ from the permanent set chiefly in being\r\nmuch smaller. The crowns are narrower and diverge more.\r\n\r\nThe =canines= are absent (unless the fourth incisors be considered to\r\nrepresent them).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 286.—SKULL OF OX TWO YEARS OF AGE, SCULPTURED TO SHOW THE\r\n    EMBEDDED PARTS OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\n  _11–4_, Permanent incisor teeth, the third and fourth not erupted;\r\n    _Di.3, 4_, third and fourth deciduous incisors; _P1–3_, upper\r\n    permanent premolars, only first erupted; _Dp.2, 3_, deciduous\r\n    premolars; _M1–3_, molars.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =cheek teeth= (Fig. 286) resemble those of the horse in number and\r\ngeneral arrangement. They are, however, smaller, and also differ in the\r\nfact that they progressively increase in size from before backward. This\r\nfeature is so marked that the first tooth is quite small, and the space\r\noccupied by the first three (_i. e._, the premolars) is only about\r\none-half of that required for the posterior three (_i. e._, the true\r\nmolars). The enamel folds stand out even more prominently in relief on\r\nthe masticatory surface than in the horse.

The\r\nabove figures are the average of observations of improved breeds under\r\nfavorable conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SALIVARY GLANDS\r\n\r\nThe =parotid gland= is smaller than that of the horse, and is light\r\nred-brown in color. It has somewhat the form of a very narrow long\r\ntriangle, and lies chiefly on the posterior part of the masseter muscle.\r\nThe thick wide upper end partly covers a large subparotid lymph gland.\r\nThe small lower end is bent forward and fits into the angle of union of\r\nthe jugular and external maxillary veins; it lies on the submaxillary\r\ngland. The parotid duct leaves the lower part of the deep face; in its\r\ncourse it resembles that of the horse, but it pierces the cheek opposite\r\nthe fifth upper cheek tooth.\r\n\r\nThe =submaxillary gland= is very large, and is pale yellow in color. It\r\nis covered to a small extent by the parotid. Its general form resembles\r\nthat of the horse, but its lower (or anterior) end is large and rounded,\r\nand is separated by a small interval only from the gland of the other\r\nside. This part can be distinctly felt in the living animal, and is\r\nrelated externally to a large submaxillary lymph gland. The duct leaves\r\nthe middle of the superficial face of the gland, crosses the\r\nstylo-hyoideus and the intermediate tendon of the digastricus, and is\r\nthen disposed as in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =sublingual gland= consists of two parts. The dorsal part (Glandula\r\nsublingualis parvicanalaris) is long, thin, and pale yellow in color. It\r\nextends from the anterior pillar of the soft palate about to the\r\nsymphysis of the jaw. It has numerous small tortuous ducts (Ductus\r\nsublinguales minores), which open between the papillæ under the side of\r\nthe tongue. The ventral part is shorter and thicker, and is salmon pink\r\nin color. It has a single duct (Ductus sublingualis major), which either\r\nopens alongside of or joins the submaxillary duct.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PHARYNX\r\n\r\nThe pharynx is short and wide. The vault (Fornix pharyngis) is divided\r\ninto two cul-de-sacs by a median fold of mucous membrane (Septum nasi\r\nmembranaceum), which is a continuation of that of the septum nasi; on\r\nthe outer wall of each is the relatively small opening of the Eustachian\r\ntube, which is covered by a simple fold of mucous membrane. The\r\nposterior nares are small. The entrance to the œsophagus is large.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 287.—SALIVARY GLANDS OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Parotid gland; _b_, submaxillary gland; _c_, inferior, _d_,\r\n    middle, and _e_, superior buccal glands; _f_, labial glands; _g_,\r\n    buccinator nerve; _h_, buccinator vein; _1_, masseter (cut); _2_,\r\n    ramus of mandible; _3_, zygomaticus muscle; _4_, conical papillæ of\r\n    lip; _5_, buccinator muscle. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s\r\n    Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  On the dorsal wall of the pharynx are two large pharyngeal lymph\r\n  glands, which, when enlarged, cause difficulty in swallowing and\r\n  breathing (Fig. 281).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ŒSOPHAGUS\r\n\r\nThis is much shorter, wider, and more dilatable than that of the horse.\r\nIts average diameter (when moderately inflated) is about two inches (ca.\r\n5 cm.), and its length in a large animal is about three to three and a\r\nhalf feet (ca. 90 to 100 cm.). The wall is relatively thin, and the\r\nmuscular tissue is striped throughout. The latter consists of two strata\r\nof spiral fibers, except near the stomach, where they are longitudinal\r\nand circular. Fibers are continued into the wall of the stomach for some\r\ndistance. There are submucous glands in the first part of the tube.\r\nThere is no terminal dilatation, and no part in the abdominal cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A very large mediastinal lymph gland lies above the posterior part of\r\n  the œsophagus and may, if enlarged, obstruct it (Fig. 289).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY\r\n\r\nThe abdominal cavity of the ox is very capacious, both absolutely and\r\nrelatively, as compared with that of the horse. This is due to several\r\nfactors. The lumbar portion of the spine is about one-fourth longer than\r\nthat of the horse. The transverse diameter between the last ribs is\r\ngreater. The costal attachment of the diaphragm is almost vertical in\r\ndirection from the lower part of the ninth rib to the extreme upper part\r\nof the thirteenth; in fact, the attachment to the last rib is not\r\nconstant. Thus the abdomen is increased at the expense of the thorax,\r\nand the last three or four ribs enter more largely into the formation of\r\nthe abdominal wall than in the horse. The flank is also much more\r\nextensive. The ilia, on the other hand, do not extend forward beyond a\r\ntransverse plane through the middle of the last lumbar vertebra. The\r\nepigastric and mesogastric regions would be separated by a plane through\r\nthe lower end of the tenth pair of ribs, or through the last thoracic\r\nvertebra. The chief differential features in the arrangement of the\r\nperitoneum will be described with the viscera.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PELVIC CAVITY\r\n\r\nThe pelvic cavity is relatively long and narrow. The inlet is more\r\noblique than that of the horse; it is elliptical in outline, and the\r\ntransverse diameter is smaller than that of the horse. The anterior\r\n(pubic) part of the floor is about horizontal, but the posterior\r\n(ischial) part slopes upward and backward to a marked degree; this part\r\nis also deeply concave transversely. The roof is concave in both\r\ndirections. The peritoneum extends backward as far as the first\r\ncoccygeal vertebra, so that the retroperitoneal part of the cavity is\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE STOMACH\r\n\r\n=General Arrangement.=—The stomach of the ox is very large, and occupies\r\nnearly three-fourths of the abdominal cavity. It fills all of the left\r\nhalf of the cavity (with the exception of the small space occupied by\r\nthe spleen) and extends considerably over the median plane into the\r\nright half.\r\n\r\nIt is compound, being composed of four divisions, viz., =rumen=,\r\n=reticulum=, =omasum=, and =abomasum=.[107] The division is clearly\r\nindicated externally by furrows or constrictions. The first three\r\ndivisions may be regarded as proventriculi or œsophageal sacculations,\r\nthe fourth being the stomach proper (in the narrower sense of the term).\r\nThe œsophagus opens into the stomach on a sort of dome formed by the\r\nrumen and reticulum, and is continued through the latter by the\r\nœsophageal groove. From the ventral end of the latter a groove traverses\r\nthe ventral wall of the omasum, thus giving a direct path to the\r\nabomasum for finely divided or fluid food. The abomasum joins the small\r\nintestine.\r\n\r\n=Capacity.=—The capacity of the stomach varies greatly, depending on the\r\nage and size of the animal. In cattle of medium size it holds 30 to 40\r\ngallons, in large animals 40 to 60, in small 25 to 35. The relative\r\nsizes of the four parts vary with age. In the new-born calf the rumen\r\nand reticulum together are about half as large as the abomasum; in ten\r\nor twelve weeks this ratio is reversed. During this period the omasum\r\nappears to be contracted and functionless. At four months the rumen and\r\nreticulum together are about four times as large as the omasum and\r\nabomasum together. At about one and one-half years the omasum equals (or\r\nnearly so) the abomasum in capacity. The four divisions have now reached\r\ntheir definitive relative capacities, the rumen constituting about 80\r\nper cent., the reticulum 5 per cent., the omasum 7 or 8 per cent., and\r\nthe abomasum 8 or 7 per cent. of the total amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EXTERIOR AND RELATIONS\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 288.—PROJECTION OF VISCERA OF COW ON BODY-WALL, LEFT SIDE.\r\n\r\n  _Oes._, Œsophagus; _Ret._, reticulum; _b.s._, anterior blind sac;\r\n    _b.s.′_, _b.s.″_, posterior blind sacs of rumen; _O_, ovary. The\r\n    left kidney, concealed by the dorsal sac of the rumen, is indicated\r\n    by dotted line. The median line of the diaphragm is dotted.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =rumen= occupies almost all of the left half of the abdominal\r\ncavity, and extends considerably over the median plane ventrally and in\r\nits middle. It is somewhat compressed laterally, and may be described as\r\nhaving two surfaces, two curvatures or borders, and two extremities. The\r\n=parietal= (or left) =surface= (Facies parietalis) is convex and is\r\nrelated to the diaphragm, spleen, and the left wall of the abdomen. It\r\nextends from the lower part of the seventh intercostal space almost to\r\nthe pelvis. The =visceral= (or right) =surface= (Facies visceralis) is\r\nsomewhat irregular, and is related chiefly to the omasum and abomasum,\r\nthe intestine, the liver, pancreas, kidneys, the uterus in the female,\r\nand the posterior aorta and vena cava. The =dorsal curvature= (Curvatura\r\ndorsalis) is convex, following the curve formed by the diaphragm and\r\nsublumbar muscles. It is firmly attached to the left portion of the\r\ncrura of the diaphragm and the sublumbar muscles by peritoneum and\r\nconnective tissue. The =ventral curvature= is also convex and lies on\r\nthe floor of the abdomen. The surfaces are marked by the right and left\r\n=longitudinal furrows= (Sulci longitudinales), which indicate externally\r\nthe division of the rumen into dorsal and ventral sacs.[108] The\r\n=reticular= (or anterior) =extremity= (Extremitas reticularis) is\r\ndivided ventrally by a transverse groove (Sulcus ruminis cranialis) into\r\ntwo sacs. The dorsal sac is the longer of the two, and curves ventrally\r\nover the round, blind end of the ventral sac. The former only is\r\ncontinuous with the reticulum, a ventral groove (Sulcus\r\nrumino-reticularis) being the only external line of demarcation.\r\nDorsally no natural separation exists, the rumen and reticulum together\r\nforming a dome-like vestibule (Atrium ventriculi) on which the œsophagus\r\nterminates. The =pelvic= (or posterior) =extremity= (Extremitas pelvina)\r\nextends nearly to the pubis, and is related to the intestine and\r\nbladder, and the uterus in the cow. It is divided into =dorsal= and\r\n=ventral blind sacs= (Saccus cæcus caudalis dorsalis, ventralis) by a\r\ndeep transverse groove (Sulcus ruminis caudalis) in which the\r\nlongitudinal furrows terminate. The blind sacs are marked off from the\r\nremainder of the rumen by the =dorsal= and =ventral coronary grooves=\r\n(Sulcus coronarius dorsalis, ventralis).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The left longitudinal groove (Sulcus longitudinalis sinister) begins\r\n  at the anterior transverse groove, passes somewhat dorsally and\r\n  backward and divides into two grooves. The ventral one is the chief\r\n  groove and passes backward to terminate in the angle of union of the\r\n  posterior blind sacs. The dorsal (accessory) groove curves dorsally\r\n  and then backward to terminate in the dorsal coronary sulcus. On the\r\n  right surface there are two longitudinal grooves. The dorsal one is\r\n  the chief sulcus (Sulcus longitudinalis dexter). It extends in a\r\n  curved direction (the convexity being dorsal) and is continuous with\r\n  the left longitudinal groove by means of the grooves between the\r\n  dorsal and ventral blind sacs at each end. The ventral groove (Sulcus\r\n  accessorius) curves somewhat ventrally and backward to rejoin the\r\n  chief sulcus between the posterior blind sacs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =reticulum= is the smallest of the four divisions in the ox. It is\r\nalso the most anterior, and lies on the concave surface of the\r\ndiaphragm, so that the median plane divides it into two nearly equal\r\nportions. It is somewhat pyriform, but much compressed from before\r\nbackward. The =parietal= or =phrenic surface= (Facies diaphragmatica) is\r\nconvex and lies against the diaphragm and liver.[109] The =ruminal= (or\r\nposterior) =surface= (Facies ruminalis) is flattened by the pressure of\r\nthe other three compartments; it ends dorsally by joining the wall of\r\nthe rumen, the concave line of junction forming, in the interior of the\r\nstomach, the lower margin of the large rumino-reticular orifice. The\r\n=omasal= (or right) =surface= is narrow and concave, and is connected\r\nwith the omasum. The =dorsal curvature= by its left portion joins the\r\nrumen to form the atrium, and by its right portion touches the liver.\r\nThe =ventral curvature= lies on the sternal portion of the diaphragm,\r\nopposite the sixth and seventh ribs. The =right extremity= forms a\r\nrounded cul-de-sac, which is in contact with the liver, omasum, and\r\nabomasum.\r\n\r\nThe =omasum= (Fig. 294) is ellipsoidal in form and somewhat compressed\r\nlaterally. It is very clearly marked off from the other divisions. It is\r\nsituated almost entirely to the right of the median plane, opposite the\r\nseventh to the eleventh ribs. The =parietal= (right) =surface= (Facies\r\ndextra) lies against the diaphragm, liver, and lateral wall of the\r\nabdomen. The contact with the latter extends over a small area only\r\n(ventral part of seventh to ninth intercostal spaces). The =visceral=\r\n(left) =surface= (Facies sinistra) is in contact with the rumen and\r\nreticulum. The =dorsal= (greater) =curvature= is convex, and is related\r\nto the diaphragm, liver, and vena cava. The =ventral= (lesser)\r\n=curvature= is concave, and rests on the abomasum chiefly, the junction\r\nwith the latter appearing as a constriction near the middle of the\r\ncurvature; at its anterior part there is a =neck= (Collum omasi) which\r\nis the connection with the reticulum.\r\n\r\nThe =abomasum= (Fig. 294) is an elongated pyriform or flask-shaped sac,\r\nwhich lies for the most part on the abdominal floor, to the right of the\r\nventral sac of the rumen. Its narrow posterior part is strongly curved,\r\nthe concavity being dorsal. The =parietal= (right) =surface= lies\r\nagainst the abdominal wall from the seventh to the twelfth intercostal\r\nspace. The =visceral= (left) =surface= is related chiefly to the ventral\r\nsac of the rumen. The =dorsal= (lesser) =curvature= is concave, and is\r\nin contact with the omasum; the junction of the two sacs is indicated by\r\na constriction about four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) from the\r\nanterior extremity of the abomasum. The =ventral= (greater) =curvature=\r\nis convex, and rests on the abdominal wall from the xiphoid cartilage to\r\nthe ventral part of the last (right) intercostal space. The =anterior\r\nextremity= forms a rounded blind sac which lies against the reticulum.\r\nThe =posterior= (or pyloric) =extremity= is much smaller and bends\r\nupward and forward to join the duodenum. About six to eight inches (ca.\r\n15 to 20 cm.) from the pylorus is a constriction which marks off the\r\npyloric portion from the fundus.\r\n\r\nThe rumen is attached by peritoneum and connective tissue to the crura\r\nof the diaphragm and left psoas muscles, from the hiatus œsophageus\r\nbackward to about the third or fourth lumbar vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe lesser omentum attaches the right face of the omasum and the pyloric\r\nportion of the abomasum to the visceral surface of the liver.\r\n\r\nA small area of the anterior part of the right face of the rumen is\r\nadherent to the adjacent surface of the abomasum. The greater part of\r\nthe ventral curvature of the omasum is attached by connective tissue to\r\nthe dorsal face of the abomasum.\r\n\r\n(Adhesion of the reticulum to the diaphragm is frequently present, but\r\nis pathological; the same is true in regard to adhesion to the liver.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                                INTERIOR\r\n\r\nThe cavity of the rumen is partially divided into dorsal and ventral\r\nsacs by the =pillars=; these are folds of the wall, strengthened by\r\nadditional muscular fibers, and correspond with the grooves on the\r\noutside. The two most extensive ones project like shelves into the\r\nanterior and posterior ends of the cavity forming the blind sacs at\r\neither extremity; they are termed the =chief pillars=. The =anterior\r\nchief pillar= (Pila cranialis) projects obliquely backward and upward\r\nfrom the ventral wall, and has a thick concave free edge which is\r\nopposite to the tenth and eleventh ribs. Its width from the middle of\r\nthe free edge to its anterior border is about eight to ten inches (ca.\r\n20 to 25 cm.). It is continued on either side by the relatively narrow\r\n=longitudinal pillars=, which connect it with the posterior pillar. The\r\n=posterior pillar= (Pila caudalis) is more nearly horizontal than the\r\nanterior one, and separates the large dorsal and ventral posterior blind\r\nsacs. Its concave free border is about a hand’s breadth in front of a\r\ntransverse plane through the external angles of the ilia. From it are\r\ndetached three =accessory pillars= on either side; of these, two pass\r\naround the blind sacs to meet the corresponding pillars of the opposite\r\nside. They thus mark off the posterior blind sacs from the general\r\ncavity, and are termed the =coronary pillars=. It will be noticed that\r\nthe ventral coronary pillar is complete, while the dorsal one is not.\r\nThe other accessory pillars join the right and left longitudinal\r\npillars. The =right longitudinal pillar= is in part double; its ventral\r\ndivision fades out about the middle of the surface, while the dorsal one\r\njoins the posterior chief pillar. The distance between the middles of\r\nthe anterior and posterior pillars is =only= about sixteen to eighteen\r\ninches (ca. 40 to 45 cm.) in a cow of medium size. In this space the\r\ndorsal and ventral sacs communicate freely.\r\n\r\nThe anterior =dorsal blind sac= of the rumen is separated from the\r\nreticulum by an almost vertical fold formed by the apposition of the\r\nwalls of the two compartments. This =rumino-reticular fold= (Pila\r\nrumino-reticularis) is opposite to the seventh rib and intercostal\r\nspace. Its free upper edge is concave and forms the lower and outer\r\nmargin of the large, oval =rumino-reticular orifice= (Ostium\r\nruminoreticulare). The inner margin of the fold if continued would end\r\nabout at the cardia, but there is in this region no demarcation between\r\nrumen and reticulum; hence it is termed the =atrium ventriculi= or\r\n=vestibule=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If the rumino-reticular fold and an imaginary completion of it be\r\n  taken as the boundary between the rumen and reticulum, it will be seen\r\n  that the cardia belongs to the latter. The outer border of the\r\n  rumino-reticular fold ends above and behind the cardia, the inner one\r\n  just behind the œsophageal groove and about four to five inches lower\r\n  down. Undoubtedly food or water swallowed with a moderate degree of\r\n  force passes first into the rumen. Foreign bodies (which are commonly\r\n  swallowed by cattle) are, however, found in the reticulum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =cardiac orifice= is opposite the seventh rib, a little to the left\r\nof the median plane and about four inches (ca. 10 cm.) below the spine;\r\nit is not funnel-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe =mucous membrane= of the rumen is brown in color, except on the\r\nmargins of the pillars, where it is pale. It is for the most part\r\nthickly studded with large papillæ, many of which are nearly half an\r\ninch (ca. 1 cm.) long. The edges of the chief pillars and a large part\r\nof the wall of the middle of the dorsal sac are, however, not\r\npapillated. The papillary arrangement is most marked in the blind sacs.\r\nThe papillæ vary much in size and form; the largest are foliate, many\r\nare narrow or filiform, and others are conical or club-shaped. The\r\nmucous membrane on the inner wall of the atrium is finely wrinkled and\r\nnon-papillated, while above and externally it is papillated. The\r\npapillary arrangement also extends over the edge of the rumino-reticular\r\nfold an inch or two (ca. 2 to 5 cm.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 289.—THORACIC AND ANTERIOR ABDOMINAL VISCERA OF OX, DEEP\r\n    DISSECTION.\r\n\r\n  Most of the rumen has been removed and the left wall of the reticulum\r\n    cut away. _A._, Left pulmonary artery; _B._, left bronchus; _V. V.\r\n    V._, pulmonary veins; _b. b._, bronchial lymph glands; _L.g._,\r\n    posterior mediastinal lymph gland; _D._, termination of duodenum;\r\n    _F._, rumino-reticular fold.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =œsophageal groove= (Sulcus œsophageus) is a semicanal which begins\r\nat the cardia and passes downward (ventrally) on the right wall of the\r\nreticulum to end at the reticulo-omasal orifice. It is about six or\r\nseven inches (ca. 15 to 18 cm.) in length. Its axial direction is\r\npractically vertical, but it is twisted in a spiral fashion; thus its\r\nthickened edges or lips project first backward, then to the left, and\r\nfinally forward. The twist involves chiefly the left lip, and the\r\nrelative positions of the lips is reversed at the ventral end.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane on the lips of the œsophageal groove is brown and\r\nwrinkled, like that of the atrium; in the bottom of the groove it is\r\npale, like that of the œsophagus, marked by longitudinal folds, and\r\npresents pointed horny papillæ on the lower part.\r\n\r\nThe =reticulo-omasal orifice= (Ostium reticulo-omasicum) is situated in\r\nthe right wall of the reticulum about five or six inches above the\r\nbottom of the latter. It is rounded, and is limited below and laterally\r\nby the junction of the lips of the œsophageal groove.\r\n\r\nIn the reticulum the mucous membrane is raised into folds about half an\r\ninch high, which inclose four-, five-, or six-sided spaces (Cellulæ\r\nreticuli); this peculiar arrangement suggested the scientific name, and\r\nalso the popular term “honeycomb.” These cells are subdivided by smaller\r\nfolds, and the bottoms are studded with pointed horny papillæ. The cells\r\ngrow smaller and gradually disappear near the œsophageal groove and the\r\nedge of the rumino-reticular fold; an inch or two from the latter the\r\nmucous membrane has the papillary arrangement of the rumen. At the\r\nreticulo-omasal orifice there are peculiar horny papillæ, which are\r\ncurved and resemble the claws of a small bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 290.—RETICULUM OF OX, FROM PHOTOGRAPH.\r\n\r\n  The specimen was cut along the greater curvature and laid open by\r\n    reflecting the anterior wall. _C_, is the cardia. The arrow points\r\n    to the reticulo-omasal orifice. The spiral twist of the œsophageal\r\n    groove was of necessity partly undone by reflecting the wall; its\r\n    lips are drawn apart, showing some of the peculiar birdclaw-like\r\n    papillæ in the lower part.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cavity of the omasum is occupied to a considerable extent by about a\r\nhundred longitudinal folds, the =laminæ= (Laminæ omasi), which spring\r\nfrom the dorsal and lateral walls. The largest of these—a dozen or more\r\nin number—have a convex attached edge, and a ventral, free, slightly\r\nconcave edge which reaches to within a short distance of the ventral\r\nwall of the sac. If these are drawn apart or a cross-section is made, it\r\nwill be seen that there is a second order of shorter laminæ, and a third\r\norder still shorter; finally, there is a series of very low folds or\r\nlines. The food is pressed into thin layers in the narrow spaces between\r\nthe laminæ (Recessus interlaminares), and reduced to a fine state of\r\ndivision by being ground down by the numerous rounded horny papillæ\r\nwhich stud the surfaces of the folds. The ventral wall of the omasum\r\nforms a groove (Sulcus omasi), which connects the reticulo-omasal\r\nopening with the omaso-abomasal opening; it is about three or four\r\ninches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) long, and is directed backward and a little\r\ndownward and to the right. It is free from leaves, but marked usually by\r\nslight folds and small papillæ; it forms a direct path from the\r\nreticulum to the abomasum for fluid and finely divided food. In the neck\r\nof the omasum there are thick folds, and a number of the peculiar\r\npapillæ already mentioned as occurring in the lower part of the\r\nœsophageal groove. The =omaso-abomasal orifice= (Ostium\r\nomaso-abomasicum) is oval, and is about four inches (ca. 10 cm.) long.\r\nIt is bounded in front by a thick muscular pillar which fades out above\r\non the lateral walls of the omasum. Laterally there are two folds\r\n(Valvulæ terminales), which probably prevent regurgitation of the\r\ncontents of the abomasum.\r\n\r\nThe cavity of the abomasum is divided by a constriction into two areas.\r\nThe first of these (fundus gland region) is lined with a soft glandular\r\nmucous membrane, which forms about a dozen large, slightly spiral folds\r\n(Plicæ spirales). The second part (pyloric region) is much narrower and\r\nresembles in appearance the corresponding region of the horse’s stomach.\r\nA small cardiac gland zone surrounds the omaso-abomasal orifice. The\r\npyloric orifice is small and round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 291.—MUSCULATURE OF ŒSOPHAGEAL GROOVE AND ADJACENT PART OF\r\n    STOMACH OF OX, SEEN FROM WITHIN AFTER REMOVAL OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Œsophagus; _b_, inner muscular layer of atrium; _d_,\r\n    reticulo-omasal orifice; _e_, _e′_, muscle of lips of groove; _g_,\r\n    lower end of muscle of larger lip, which curves around the\r\n    reticulo-omasal orifice in part and spreads out in the inner\r\n    muscular layer of the reticulum in part; _h_, lower end of muscle of\r\n    smaller lip which in part curves around the reticulo-omasal orifice\r\n    and is in part continuous with the inner muscular layer of the\r\n    omasal groove and the omasum; _i_, inner muscular layer of\r\n    reticulum. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The =serous coat= invests all of the free surface of the\r\nstomach. The surface of the rumen which is attached to the dorsal\r\nabdominal wall is of course uncovered, as well as the adjacent area to\r\nwhich the spleen is attached. The furrows are bridged over by the\r\nperitoneum and superficial muscle-fibers, and contain fat and (in most\r\ncases) branches of the gastric arteries. The =lesser omentum= passes\r\nfrom the visceral surface of the liver to the right (parietal) face of\r\nthe omasum and the pyloric portion of the abomasum. There is a fold\r\nbetween the ventral curvature of the omasum and the dorsal curvature of\r\nthe abomasum. The =great omentum= is formed by the peritoneum leaving\r\nthe stomach along the left longitudinal and posterior transverse furrows\r\nand the right surface of the rumen below the longitudinal furrow, also\r\nthe ventral curvature of the abomasum. Its superficial (ventral) part is\r\nattached on the right to the duodenum, while the deep (dorsal) part\r\nblends with the mesentery. It conceals the greater part of the intestine\r\non the right side, with the exception of the duodenum, and covers the\r\nventral sac of the rumen almost entirely. It is not lace-like, as in the\r\nhorse, and contains a large amount of fat in animals in good condition.\r\nThe =epiploic foramen= (of Winslow) is almost sagittal in direction.\r\n\r\nThe =muscular coat of the rumen= consists of an external longitudinal,\r\nand a thicker internal circular layer. The latter forms the bulk of the\r\nchief pillars, where it is about one-half to one inch (ca. 1 to 2 cm.)\r\nthick. Scattered bundles of striped muscle-fibers radiate from the\r\ncardia in the wall of the atrium.\r\n\r\nThe =muscular coat of the reticulum= consists of two chief layers which\r\nbegin and end at the œsophageal groove; they pass in a circular or\r\noblique fashion around the sac, the fibers of the two layers crossing\r\neach other at an acute angle. The walls of the cells contain a central\r\nmuscular layer. The lips of the œsophageal groove contain a thick layer\r\nof longitudinal fibers, which are largely continuous at or cross each\r\nother below the reticulo-omasal orifice. The bottom of the groove has\r\ntwo layers of oblique, unstriped muscle-fibers, with a variable outer\r\nlayer of striped muscle continuous with that of the œsophagus.\r\n\r\nThe =muscular coat of the omasum= consists of a thin external\r\nlongitudinal layer and a thick internal circular layer. At the omasal\r\ngroove there is an additional inner layer of longitudinal fibers. The\r\nlaminæ contain three muscular strata—a central layer of vertical fibers,\r\nflanked on either side by a layer of longitudinal fibers, which are\r\ncontinuous at the attached border with the muscularis mucosæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 292.—STOMACH OF NEW-BORN CALF, RIGHT VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The rumen is raised.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =muscular coat of the abomasum= consists of longitudinal and\r\ncircular layers; the latter forms a well-developed pyloric sphincter.\r\n\r\nThe =mucous membrane= of the first three divisions is destitute of\r\nglands, and is covered with a thick, stratified, squamous epithelium;\r\nthe superficial part of the latter is horny, and is shed in large\r\npatches in the rumen and omasum. The =corium= (Tunica propria) is\r\npapillated. The mucous membrane of the abomasum is glandular, and\r\ncorresponds to that of the right sac of the stomach of the horse. The\r\nshort fundus glands occur in that part which presents the large folds,\r\nwhile the long pyloric glands are found in the remainder, except about\r\nthe omaso-abomasal orifice, where cardiac glands occur. The mucosa of\r\nthe fundus gland region is very thin as compared with that of the horse.\r\nThere is a round prominence on the pyloric valve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE INTESTINE\r\n\r\nThe intestine of the ox lies almost entirely to the right of the median\r\nplane, chiefly in contact with the right face of the rumen. It is\r\nattached to the sublumbar region by a common mesentery.\r\n\r\nThe =small intestine= has an average length of about 130 feet (ca. 40\r\nm.) and a diameter of about two inches (ca. 5 to 6 cm.).\r\n\r\nThe =duodenum= is about three or four feet (ca. 1 m.) in length. It\r\npasses forward to the visceral surface of the liver; here it forms,\r\nventral to the right kidney, an =S=-shaped curve. Thence it runs\r\nbackward almost to the external angle of the ilium, where it turns on\r\nitself, passes forward alongside of the terminal part of the colon, and\r\njoins the mesenteric part (jejunum) under the right kidney. It is\r\nattached to the liver by the lesser omentum, to the abomasum by the\r\ngreat omentum, and to the terminal part of the colon. The =bile-duct=\r\nopens in the ventral part of the =S=-shaped curve, about two feet (ca.\r\n60 cm.) from the pylorus. The =pancreatic duct= opens about a foot (ca.\r\n30 cm.) further back.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the small intestine is arranged in numerous very close\r\ncoils, in contact chiefly with the right face of the ventral sac of the\r\nrumen, forming a sort of festoon at the edge of the mesentery. It is not\r\nsubject to much variation in position, but a few coils may find their\r\nway behind the blind sacs of the rumen to the left side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 293.—PEYER’S PATCHES OF SMALL INTESTINE OF OX (about ⅓ natural\r\n    size).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe orifices of the pancreatic duct and the bile-duct are on papillæ, no\r\ndiverticulum being present. There are permanent transverse folds of the\r\nmucous membrane (Plicæ circulares). Duodenal glands (of Brunner) occur\r\nin the first fifteen feet or more (4 to 5 m.), intestinal glands\r\nthroughout. Peyer’s patches are larger and more distinct than in the\r\nhorse, and vary greatly in size and number; in adult cattle there are\r\neighteen to forty; in calves, twenty to fifty-eight. They usually have\r\nthe form of narrow bands. Close to the ileo-cæcal valve there is always\r\na patch, and in most cases there is also a patch on the cæcal side of\r\nthe valve.\r\n\r\nThe =large intestine= is much smaller in caliber than that of the horse,\r\nhas no bands, and is not sacculated. Most of it is situated between the\r\nlayers of the common mesentery.\r\n\r\nThe =cæcum= is about 20 to 30 inches (ca. 50 to 60 cm.) long, 4 to 5\r\ninches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) wide, and has a capacity of about 2½ gallons\r\n(ca. 9 to 10 liters). It begins opposite the lower part of the eleventh\r\nrib, and extends upward and backward against the right flank; its\r\nrounded blind end is free, and lies near or in the pelvic inlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 294.—PROJECTION OF VISCERA OF BULL ON BODY-WALL, RIGHT SIDE.\r\n\r\n  _P._, Pylorus; _G.b._, gall-bladder; _R.K._, right kidney; _L.K._,\r\n    left kidney; _P._, (above duodenum) pancreas; _Bl._, urinary\r\n    bladder; _V.s._, vesicula seminalis; _B.g._, bulbo-urethral\r\n    (Cowper’s) gland.

Its capacity is about 6 to 8 gallons (ca. 25 to 30 liters).\r\nWith the exception of its first and terminal parts, it is arranged in\r\ndouble elliptical coils between the layers of the mesentery; the\r\nadjacent parts are therefore alternately centripetal and centrifugal\r\n(Gyri centripetales et centrifugales). The first part (Ansa proximalis)\r\nis marked off from the cæcum only by the ileo-cæcal opening; it forms an\r\n=S=-shaped curve and is continued by the spiral part (Ansa spiralis).\r\nThe coils of this are attached to each other by connective tissue, and\r\nare best seen from the inner side. The bowel gradually diminishes in\r\ncaliber, and the terminal part (Ansa distalis) leaves the spiral mass,\r\npasses forward to the great mesenteric artery and turns backward between\r\nthe duodenum and the initial sigmoid part. From the ventral surface of\r\nthe right kidney it passes backward, forms an =S=-shaped curve near the\r\npelvic inlet, and joins the rectum; this part is attached to the\r\nsublumbar muscles by a short mesentery, and is also attached to the\r\ndorsal part of the duodenum.\r\n\r\nThe =rectum= is somewhat shorter than that of the horse, and is usually\r\ncovered with peritoneum as far back as the first coccygeal vertebra. The\r\nretroperitoneal part is surrounded by a quantity of fat. The anus is not\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 296.—LIVER OF OX, LEFT MARGINAL VIEW; HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =serous coat= is of course absent on the adherent surfaces of the\r\nspiral part of the colon. There is a large amount of fat in the\r\nmesentery. The =longitudinal muscular coat= is evenly distributed,\r\nconsequently there is no sacculation of the bowel. There is a valvular\r\nmucous fold at the ileo-cæcal orifice. A Peyer’s patch occurs in the\r\nbeginning of the cæcum and one in the first part of the colon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LIVER\r\n\r\nThe liver lies almost entirely to the right of the median plane. Its\r\nlong axis is directed obliquely downward and forward, about parallel\r\nwith the median plane, and corresponds to the curvature of the right\r\nportion of the diaphragm. It is less extensive, but thicker than that of\r\nthe horse. Its average weight is about 10 to 12 pounds (ca. 4.5 to 5.5\r\nkg.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  In small subjects the weight (according to Schmaltz) varies from 6½ to\r\n  10 pounds (ca. 3 to 4.5 kg.), in large subjects from 11 to 13 pounds\r\n  (ca. 5 to 6 kg.). According to Schneider, the average weight is about\r\n  13 pounds (ca. 6 kg.)—a little over 1 per cent. of the live weight and\r\n  about 2 per cent. of the dressed carcass.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen hardened _in situ_, its configuration adapts it accurately to the\r\nstructures with which it is in contact.\r\n\r\nThe =parietal surface= is convex and is for the most part applied to the\r\nright part of the diaphragm, but a small part of it is in direct contact\r\nwith the last two ribs and with the flank at the lumbo-costal angle. It\r\nfaces upward, forward, and to the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The curvature of the parietal surface is not regular. It is marked,\r\n  except in its ventral part, by a blunt oblique ridge which corresponds\r\n  to the basal border of the right lung. This prominence divides the\r\n  surface into two areas. Of these, the external one is directed\r\n  outward, is only slightly convex, and often shows impressions of the\r\n  last three ribs. The inner area presents a depression produced by the\r\n  right crus of the diaphragm, and otherwise is regularly convex and\r\n  adapted to the tendinous center and sternal portion of the diaphragm.\r\n  The falciform ligament is attached to the surface from the œsophageal\r\n  notch to the umbilical fissure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 297.—LIVER OF YOUNG OX, VISCERAL SURFACE; HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =visceral surface= is concave and very irregular; it presents\r\nimpressions of the chief organs which are in contact with it—the omasum\r\nand reticulum. It is also related to the pancreas and duodenum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The following markings are quite distinct on the visceral surface of\r\n  well hardened specimens: (1) The omasal impression (Impressio omasica)\r\n  is a deep central cavity below the portal fissure. (2) The reticular\r\n  impression (Impressio reticularis) is a smaller marginal depression\r\n  below the œsophageal notch and the inner part of the preceding, from\r\n  which it is separated by a rounded ridge. (3) The abomasal impression\r\n  (Impressio abomasica), present only in the calf, is produced by the\r\n  anterior part of the abomasum. It lies along the ventral part of the\r\n  surface, and is separated by ridges from the preceding impressions. It\r\n  disappears as the omasum and reticulum increase in size and displace\r\n  the abomasum from contact with the liver. (4) Shallow grooves for the\r\n  =S=-shaped portion of the duodenum (Impressio duodenalis) may be found\r\n  above and external to the portal fissure. (5) The fossa of the\r\n  gall-bladder (Fossa vesicæ felleæ) is distinct when that organ is\r\n  full. In the calf the omasal impression is small, and the abomasal one\r\n  large in correspondence with the relative sizes of these two sacs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =portal fissure= is a well defined rounded depression, situated\r\ndorsal to the omasal impression. It contains, besides the vessels and\r\nduct, several large hepatic lymph glands. Above and external to it a\r\npart of the pancreas is attached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 298.—LINE DRAWING OF LIVER OF OX, VISCERAL SURFACE OF SOFT\r\n    SPECIMEN.\r\n\r\n  _L.g._, Hepatic lymph glands at portal fissure.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal border= is short and thick; it extends backward a short\r\ndistance beyond the upper part of the last rib. It presents the large,\r\nthick, quadrilateral =caudate lobe=, and a deep depression for the right\r\nkidney and adrenal.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral border= is short and thin and has no interlobar incisures.\r\n\r\nThe =right= (or external) =border= is marked by a small umbilical\r\nfissure, in which the ligamentum teres is attached in the young subject.\r\n\r\nThe =left border= presents the œsophageal notch below its middle. Above\r\nthis it is practically median in position, and lodges the posterior vena\r\ncava, which is partially embedded in the gland. Below the notch the\r\nborder extends an inch or two (ca. 2.5 to 5 cm.) to the left of the\r\nmedian plane opposite the ventral third of the sixth rib.\r\n\r\nThere is no left lateral ligament. The falciform ligament is usually\r\npresent, but the ligamentum teres is found only in young subjects. The\r\nlesser omentum leaves the liver along a line extending from the\r\nœsophageal notch to the portal fissure. The only distinct lobe in the\r\nadult is the caudate (Processus caudatus).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 299.—PANCREAS OF OX, GASTRO-INTESTINAL SURFACE, WITH RELATED\r\n    ORGANS.\r\n\r\n  The position of some of the larger lymph glands (_l.g._) is indicated\r\n    by dotted line; also the intraglandular course of the pancreatic\r\n    duct. Probe is passed through epiploic foramen (of Winslow).\r\n]\r\n\r\nA =gall-bladder= (Vesica fellea) is present. This is a pear-shaped sac,\r\nfour to six inches (ca. 10 to 15 cm.) long, which lies partly on the\r\nvisceral surface of the liver (to which it is attached), but largely on\r\nthe abdominal wall at the lower part of the eleventh or twelfth\r\nintercostal space. It may be regarded as a diverticulum of the\r\nbile-duct, enlarged to form a reservoir for the bile. Its neck is\r\ncontinued by the =cystic duct= (Ductus cysticus), which joins the\r\nhepatic duct at an acute angle just outside of the portal fissure, to\r\nform with it the bile-duct (Ductus choledochus). The latter is short and\r\nenters the second bend of the =S=-shaped curve of the duodenum, _i. e._,\r\nabout two feet (ca. 60 cm.) from the pylorus. Several small ducts\r\n(Ductus hepato-cystici) open directly into the gall-bladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the new-born calf the liver is relatively much larger than in the\r\n  adult. The visceral surface presents, below the portal fissure, a\r\n  large rounded eminence, which is caused by the presence in the\r\n  underlying gland substance of a large venous sinus into which the\r\n  umbilical and portal veins empty. A large vessel, the =ductus\r\n  venosus=, leads from this sinus directly to the posterior vena cava.\r\n  Just external to this elevation is a small but distinct lobe about two\r\n  inches long (Processus papillaris?). The umbilical fissure is deep and\r\n  partially divides the gland into two chief lobes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PANCREAS\r\n\r\nThe pancreas of the ox is irregularly quadrilateral in form, and lies\r\nalmost entirely to the right of the median plane. Its weight is about\r\nthe same as that of the horse. Its dorsal surface is related to the\r\ncrura of the diaphragm, the cœliac and anterior mesenteric arteries, and\r\nthe liver. It is attached to the liver at and external to the portal\r\nfissure, and to the crura of the diaphragm. Between these adhesions it\r\nis free and forms the ventral wall of the epiploic foramen (of Winslow).\r\nOn the right side it extends backward beyond the caudate lobe of the\r\nliver between the layers of the mesoduodenum; here it is in contact with\r\nthe upper part of the flank at the lumbo-costal angle, and is related\r\nabove to the right kidney and by its ventro-lateral border to the\r\nventral part of the duodenum. The gastro-intestinal or ventral surface\r\nis in contact with the dorsal curvature of the rumen and the intestine.\r\nThe portal vein passes through the gland. The left extremity is small;\r\nthe right or posterior is wide and thin and is often divided into two\r\nbranches. The duct leaves the posterior part of the ventro-lateral (or\r\nright) border and enters the duodenum about twelve inches (ca. 30 cm.)\r\nfurther back than the bile-duct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 300.—SPLEEN OF OX; VISCERAL SURFACE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE SPLEEN\r\n\r\nThe spleen has an elongated, elliptical outline, both extremities being\r\nthin, rounded, and similar in size.\r\n\r\nIts average weight is about 30 ounces (ca. 800 to 900 gm.), or about ⅙\r\nper cent. of the body-weight. Its length is about 16 to 20 inches (ca.\r\n40 to 50 cm.), its width about 5 to 6 inches (ca. 12 to 15 cm.), and in\r\nthe middle its thickness is about an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.).\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal extremity= lies under the upper ends of the last two ribs;\r\nthe =ventral extremity= is usually opposite the seventh or eighth rib,\r\nabout a handbreadth above its junction with the cartilage. The =parietal\r\nsurface= is convex, and is related to the diaphragm. The =visceral\r\nsurface= is concave, and is related chiefly to the left face of the\r\nrumen, but also usually to a narrow adjacent area of the reticulum. The\r\ndorsal part is attached to the left crus of the diaphragm and the left\r\nsurface of the rumen by peritoneum and connective tissue; the ventral\r\npart is free. The hilus is situated on the dorsal third of the visceral\r\nsurface, near the anterior border.\r\n\r\n\r\n  About one-half of the visceral surface of the spleen is attached\r\n  directly to the rumen and is not covered by peritoneum; the line of\r\n  reflection of the latter crosses the surface obliquely, from the upper\r\n  part of the posterior border to the anterior border a little below the\r\n  middle. Similarly there is a narrow uncovered area on the upper part\r\n  of the parietal surface along the anterior border. The hilus is not a\r\n  groove, but a simple depression. When hardened _in situ_, the organ is\r\n  seen to be somewhat twisted, so that the upper part of the parietal\r\n  surface faces upward and forward, while below it is directed outward.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF THE SHEEP\r\n\r\nThe =lips= are thin and mobile; the upper one is marked by a very\r\ndistinct philtrum, and otherwise is not bare.\r\n\r\nThe anterior part of the =hard palate= is prominent and smooth; on the\r\nposterior part of this area there are two narrow depressions in the form\r\nof a =V=, at the deep anterior ends of which the naso-palatine ducts\r\nopen. The ridges of the palate are irregular and their edges are smooth.\r\nThe posterior third or rather more of the palate is not ridged and\r\npresents numerous orifices of ducts of the palatine glands. The mucous\r\nmembrane is often more or less pigmented.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the =cheeks= is covered with large papillæ, many\r\nof which are long and sharp-pointed, while others are short and blunt.\r\nThere is also a series of conical papillæ on the floor of the mouth\r\nunder the lateral part of the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe =tongue= resembles that of the ox in form, but the tip is\r\ncomparatively smooth; the papillæ here are very numerous, but short and\r\nblunt. This difference is in conformity with the dissimilarity in the\r\nmode of prehension. The prominence of the dorsum is commonly not so\r\npronounced nor so sharply marked off in front as in the ox. The root is\r\nsmooth. The mucous membrane of the dorsum is often pigmented in spots.\r\n\r\nThe dental formula is the same as that of the ox. The =incisor teeth=\r\nform a narrow and strongly curved arch. The crowns are long and narrow;\r\ntheir labial surfaces are strongly convex and end at a sharp edge which\r\nis used in cropping the grass. The roots are more firmly embedded than\r\nin the ox.\r\n\r\nThe =cheek teeth= resemble those of the ox. There is a thinner layer of\r\ncement, which is usually black.\r\n\r\nThe average periods of eruption of the teeth are indicated in the\r\nsubjoined table.\r\n\r\n     TEETH       TEMPORARY                   PERMANENT\r\n     I_{1}.

It does not project into the fauces. The mucous membrane of the\r\nlatter presents two deep and very narrow tonsillar sinuses on either\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 303.—CROSS-SECTION OF SHEEP, THROUGH NINTH THORACIC VERTEBRA,\r\n    ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cardiac orifice; _2_, œsophageal groove; _3_, rumino-reticular\r\n    orifice; _4_, rumino-reticular fold; _5_, dorsal sac of rumen; _6_,\r\n    body of ninth thoracic vertebra; _7_, vena hemiazygos; _8_, aorta;\r\n    _9_, posterior mediastinal lymph gland; _10_, _10_, crura of\r\n    diaphragm; _11_, posterior vena cava; _12_, portal vein; _R.l._,\r\n    right lung; _L.l._, left lung; _S_, spleen (cut very obliquely);\r\n    _L_, liver; _R_, reticulum (posterior wall). Arrow points to\r\n    reticulo-omasal orifice.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe fornix of the =pharynx= presents a median plicated fold which is a\r\ncontinuation of the septum nasi. The pharyngeal orifice of the\r\nEustachian tube has the form of a crescentic slit, placed about on a\r\nlevel with the inferior nasal meatus. There are two large lymph glands\r\nand a number of hæmolymph glands above the pharynx.\r\n\r\nThe =œsophagus= has a lumen of about an inch when moderately distended;\r\notherwise it resembles that of the ox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 304.—ABDOMINAL VISCERA OF SHEEP, SUPERFICIAL VENTRAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =stomach= is like that of the ox in its general arrangement. Its\r\naverage capacity is about four gallons (ca. 15 liters). The =cardiac\r\nopening= is opposite the middle of the eighth intercostal space; it is\r\njust to the left of the median plane and about two to three inches (ca.\r\n5 to 7 cm.) below the vertebral column. The ventral sac of the =rumen=\r\nis relatively larger and extends further to the right of the median\r\nplane than in the ox. There are no coronary pillars in the dorsal sac,\r\nbut its upper part is papillated. The papillæ of the rumen are\r\nrelatively =large= and somewhat tongue-like; the largest are about a\r\nfourth of an inch (ca. 6 mm.) in length. The =reticulum= is relatively\r\nlarger than in the ox. Its ventral part curves more backward and less to\r\nthe right than in the ox. The parietal surface extends forward as far as\r\nthe sixth rib or intercostal space, and is related to the diaphragm and\r\nliver. The fundus lies on the sternal part of the diaphragm and in\r\ncontact with the abomasum. The =œsophageal groove= is disposed much like\r\nthat of the ox, and is about four to five inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) long.\r\nThe =omasum= is much smaller than the reticulum, its capacity being only\r\nabout one pint. It is oval and compressed laterally. It is situated\r\nalmost entirely to the right of the median plane, opposite to the ninth\r\nand tenth ribs, higher than in the ox, and has no contact with the\r\nabdominal wall. It is related on the right to the liver and\r\ngall-bladder, on the left to the rumen, and below to the abomasum. The\r\nlaminæ are less numerous than in the ox; in the neck which connects the\r\nomasum with the reticulum they have the form of low thick ridges, and\r\nbear long, pointed, horny papillæ. The =abomasum= is relatively larger\r\nand longer than in the ox. Its capacity is about twice that of the\r\nreticulum and averages about two quarts (ca. 1.75 to 2 liters). The\r\nblind anterior end lies almost centrally in the xiphoid region, in\r\nrelation to the liver and reticulum. Its body extends backward a little\r\nbelow and almost parallel with the right costal arch. The pylorus is\r\nopposite the ventral end of the eleventh or twelfth intercostal space.\r\nThe cells of the reticulum are much shallower than in the ox. At the\r\nreticulo-omasal opening and on the adjacent part of the laminæ of the\r\nomasum are large, pointed, horny papillæ. The number of laminæ is less\r\nthan in the ox.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the =intestine= is like that of the ox. The\r\n=small intestine= is about 80 feet (ca. 24 to 25 m.) long; its average\r\ndiameter is about an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.), the caliber increasing in\r\nits terminal part, where a very extensive Peyer’s patch is found. The\r\n=cæcum= is about 10 to 12 inches (ca. 25 to 30 cm.) long, 2 inches (ca.\r\n5 cm.) wide, and has a capacity of about a quart (ca. 1 liter). The\r\n=colon= is about 15 feet (ca. 4 to 5 m.) long. Its caliber is at first\r\nabout the same as that of the cæcum, but diminishes to about the width\r\nof the small intestine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 305.—LIVER OF SHEEP, VISCERAL SURFACE; HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =liver= weighs about 20 to 25 ounces (ca. 550 to 700 gm.). It lies\r\nentirely to the right of the median plane. The parietal surface is\r\nrelated almost exclusively to the right part of the diaphragm. The\r\nvisceral surface presents extensive reticular and abomasal impressions,\r\nand a small omasal impression internal to the portal fissure. The\r\numbilical fissure is deep and partially divides the gland into two chief\r\nlobes. The caudate lobe is prismatic and blunt-pointed. The neck of the\r\ngall-bladder is long. The bile-duct joins the pancreatic duct to form a\r\n=common duct= (Ductus choledochus communis) which opens into the\r\nduodenum about one foot (ca. 30 cm.) from the pylorus.\r\n\r\nThe =pancreas= is arranged as in the ox. Its duct unites with the\r\nbile-duct.\r\n\r\nThe =spleen= (Fig. 301) is somewhat triangular, with the angles rounded\r\noff. It weighs about three or four ounces (ca. 100 grams). Its length is\r\nabout five inches (ca. 12 to 13 cm.) and its greatest width about four\r\ninches (ca. 10 cm.). The parietal surface is convex and is related to\r\nthe diaphragm, to which rather more than the anterior third is adherent.\r\nThe visceral surface is concave and its anterior half is attached to the\r\ndorsal curvature of the rumen. The dorsal end or base is attached to the\r\nleft crus of the diaphragm under the last two or three ribs. The hilus\r\nis at the posterior basal angle. The ventral end is narrower and thinner\r\nthan the base; it is situated opposite the ninth and tenth ribs above\r\ntheir middles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 306.—LIVER OF SHEEP, PARIETAL SURFACE; HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF THE PIG\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE MOUTH\r\n\r\nThe =rima oris= is extensive, the angles of the mouth being situated far\r\nback. The =upper lip= is thick and short, and is blended with the snout;\r\nthe =lower lip= is small and pointed. The labial glands are few and\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the =cheeks= is smooth. The =buccal glands= are\r\ncompactly arranged in two rows opposite the cheek teeth. The =parotid\r\nduct= opens opposite the fourth or fifth cheek tooth.\r\n\r\nThe =hard palate= is long and narrow; it is marked by a median furrow,\r\non each side of which are twenty or more ridges. On its anterior part\r\nthere is a triangular incisive papilla, at which the naso-palatine ducts\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThe =soft palate= is very thick. Its direction almost continues that of\r\nthe hard palate, _i. e._, it is nearly horizontal. It extends to the\r\nmiddle of the oral surface of the epiglottis.[110] It has a median\r\nprolongation termed the =uvula=. The oral surface presents a median\r\nfurrow, on either side of which is an oval raised area, marked by\r\nnumerous crypts; these elevations are the =tonsils=. Tonsillar tissue\r\nalso occurs in the lateral walls of the fauces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 307.—TONGUE OF PIG.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Apex; _2_, dorsum; _3_, root; _a_, orifices of ducts of lingual\r\n    glands; _b_, papillæ of root; _c_, vallate papilla (not really so\r\n    distinct as in figure); _d_, foliate papilla; _e_, fungiform\r\n    papillæ; _f_, epiglottis (pulled back); _g_, median\r\n    glosso-epiglottic fold.

The frenum linguæ is\r\ndouble.\r\n\r\nThe =dental formula= of the pig is:\r\n\r\n                         (   3   1   4   3 )\r\n                       2 ( I - C - P - M - ) = 44\r\n                         (   3   1   4   3 )\r\n\r\nThe formula for the temporary teeth is:\r\n\r\n                         (    3    1    4 )\r\n                       2 ( Di - Dc - Dp - ) = 32\r\n                         (    3    1    4 )\r\n\r\nThe =upper incisors= are small; they are separated from each other by\r\nspaces, and from the canines by a larger interval. The first incisors\r\nare the largest, are convergent, and have no distinct neck. The second\r\nare narrower and somewhat smaller. The third (corner) incisors are much\r\nsmaller, are flattened laterally, and have three small eminences on the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nThe =lower incisors= are almost horizontal and are convergent and close\r\ntogether. The first and second are about equal in size, prismatic, and\r\ndeeply implanted in the jaw. The labial surface is slightly convex, the\r\nlingual concave and marked near its extremity by a ridge. The third\r\nincisor is much smaller and has a short narrow crown and a distinct\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 308.—SKULL OF PIG ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF OLD, SCULPTURED TO SHOW\r\n    THE EMBEDDED PARTS OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\n  _I1–3_, Incisors; _C_, canines; _P1–4_, premolars; _M1–3_, molars.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =canine teeth= or tusks of the male are greatly developed and\r\nproject out of the mouth.

They are short-crowned teeth with a distinct neck and\r\nroot. The first tooth in each jaw is small, simple, and appears only\r\nonce; in the lower jaw it is near the canine, in the upper near the\r\nsecond cheek tooth.

The vault of the pharynx (Fornix\r\npharyngis) is divided by a median fold of mucous membrane which is a\r\ndirect continuation of the septum nasi. On either side of this is an\r\ninfundibulum in which the Eustachian tube opens.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ŒSOPHAGUS\r\n\r\nThe =œsophagus= is short and nearly straight. It has (according to\r\nRubeli) a potential caliber of nearly 3 inches (ca. 7 cm.) at either\r\nend, and about 1⁷⁄₁₀ inches (ca. 4.2 cm.) in its middle part.[112] The\r\nmuscular coat, except near the cardia, is striated. There are mucous\r\nglands in the submucosa to about the middle of the tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 317.—ABDOMINAL VISCERA OF YOUNG PIG, VENTRAL ASPECT.\r\n\r\n  The stomach was very large in this subject.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 318.—DIAGRAM OF CÆCUM AND COLON OF PIG.\r\n\r\n  Coils of colon have been pulled apart somewhat.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 319.—SOLITARY NODULES FROM LARGE INTESTINE OF PIG.\r\n    (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d.

(After P. Schumann.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nTHE STOMACH\r\n\r\nThe =stomach= is large and pyriform. Its average capacity is about 1½ to\r\n2 gallons (ca. 5.7 to 8 liters). When full it extends backward to the\r\nlast left intercostal space laterally and the umbilicus ventrally. The\r\nleft portion is large and rounded, while the right portion (Pars\r\npylorica) is small, and bends sharply upward to join the small\r\nintestine. The parietal surface is related to the liver, gall-bladder,\r\nand diaphragm. The visceral surface is related to the intestine, the\r\nmesentery, and the pancreas. The great curvature is related to the\r\ndiaphragm, spleen, and abdominal floor. The pyloric end lies on the\r\nright lateral lobe of the liver. The left extremity presents a flattened\r\nconical blind pouch, the =diverticulum ventriculi=, the apex of which\r\nprojects backward. The œsophagus joins the stomach very obliquely,\r\nalmost in the median plane, and about three or four inches (ca. 8 to 10\r\ncm.) below the twelfth thoracic vertebra. The cardiac opening is\r\nslit-like and is bounded above and to the left by a fold which contains\r\na thickening of the internal oblique layer of the muscular coat. The\r\nopening into the diverticulum is situated above and a little to the left\r\nof the cardia; it is transversely oval, and is bounded (except\r\nexternally) by a thick fold which contains spirally arranged muscular\r\nfibers. The mucous membrane may be divided into four regions. Over a\r\nquadrilateral area around the cardia (about one inch on the right and\r\ntwo or three inches on the left side of the orifice) it is œsophageal in\r\ncharacter, and presents a number of folds. A sharp line of demarcation\r\nseparates this from the rest of the mucous membrane, which is soft and\r\nglandular. The second or cardiac gland region is pale gray in color and\r\nthin (ca. 0.5 to 1 mm.); it extends about to the middle of the stomach.\r\nThe third or fundus gland region is readily distinguished by its\r\nthickness (ca. 3 mm.) and its brownish-red mottled appearance.[113] The\r\nfourth or pyloric region is pale, thinner than the preceding, and\r\npresents a number of irregular folds. At the pylorus there is a\r\nremarkable ridge which projects from the wall of the lesser curvature\r\nand diminishes considerably the size of the orifice. It is about an inch\r\nand a half (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) long and nearly half an inch (ca. 1 cm.)\r\nhigh. Sometimes it is grooved; in other cases it has the form of a\r\nrounded eminence attached by a pedicle to the wall. Fibers from the\r\ncircular muscular coat extend into it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 321.—LIVER OF PIG, SOFT SPECIMEN SKETCHED WITH LOBES DRAWN APART.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE INTESTINE\r\n\r\nThe =small intestine= is 50 to 65 feet (ca. 15 to 20 m.) long. The\r\nmesentery of about the first two feet (ca. 60 cm.) is two to two and a\r\nhalf inches (ca. 5 to 6 cm.) long; this part may be termed duodenum. The\r\nremainder (Jejuno-ileum) has a mesentery about six to eight inches (ca.\r\n15 to 20 cm.) long, which is thick and contains a quantity of fat, and\r\nnumerous large lymph glands at its root; the root is attached in the\r\nsublumbar region behind the stomach and blends here with the mesentery\r\nof the large intestine. The small intestine is arranged in close coils\r\nand lies mainly on the left side and floor of the abdomen, from the\r\nstomach to the pelvis; some coils, however, lie against the right flank.\r\nThe opening of the =bile-duct= is about one or two inches (ca. 2.5 to 5\r\ncm.) from the pylorus, and that of the =pancreatic duct= about four or\r\nfive inches (ca. 10 to 15 cm.) beyond it. =Peyer’s patches= and\r\n=solitary glands= are numerous and very distinct; the patches are\r\nusually band-like and prominent; the solitary glands form projecting\r\nnodules marked by crypts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 322.—LIVER OF PIG, VISCERAL SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  Photograph of specimen hardened _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =large intestine= is about 15 feet (ca. 4 to 5 meters) in length,\r\nand is for the most part much wider than the small intestine; it is\r\nconnected by a mesentery with the dorsal abdominal wall between the\r\nkidneys. The =cæcum= is cylindrical, about 8 to 12 inches (ca. 20 to 30\r\ncm.) long, and 3 to 4 inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) wide. It lies against the\r\nupper part of the right flank, its blind end reaching to within about\r\ntwo inches (ca. 5 cm.) of the pelvic inlet. The ileum joins the cæcum\r\nobliquely and projects somewhat into its lumen. The =colon= has at first\r\nabout the same caliber as the cæcum, but becomes gradually smaller. Most\r\nof it is arranged in three close, double spiral coils in the mesentery,\r\nin relation chiefly to the right flank externally, and to the small\r\nintestine behind and to the left. On emerging from this spiral\r\nlabyrinth, it passes forward to the stomach and pancreas and then turns\r\nbackward; this terminal part is narrow, median in position, and closely\r\nattached by a short mesentery to the sublumbar region. The =rectum= is\r\nusually surrounded by a quantity of fat. The cæcum has three\r\nlongitudinal muscular bands and three rows of sacculations, which are\r\ncontinued a short distance on the colon. The spiral colon has two bands\r\nand two series of sacculations, which, however, gradually disappear in\r\nthe centrifugal part.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LIVER\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 323.—LIVER OF PIG, PARIETAL SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  Photograph of specimen hardened _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe liver is relatively large, its average weight being about 4 to 4½\r\npounds (ca. 2 kg.). It is thick and very strongly curved.[114] It is\r\ndivided by three deep interlobar incisures into four principal\r\n=lobes=—=right lateral=, =right central=, =left central=, =left\r\nlateral=; the last of these is usually considerably the largest. On the\r\nupper part of the right lateral lobe is the =caudate lobe= and its\r\nprocess. That part of the right central lobe which lies below the portal\r\nfissure and to the left of the gall-bladder and cystic duct is\r\nhomologous with the quadrate lobe of man. The parietal surface is\r\nextremely convex, its most anterior part reaching to a plane through the\r\nlower part of the sixth or seventh intercostal space. The visceral\r\nsurface is deeply concave; most of it is related to the stomach, for\r\nwhich there is a correspondingly large and deep gastric impression.\r\nThere is a duodenal impression on the upper part of the right lateral\r\nlobe, but no renal impression, as the right kidney does not touch the\r\nliver. The fossa for the gall-bladder is mainly on the right central\r\nlobe, but also in part on the adjacent surface of the left central lobe.\r\nThe posterior vena cava enters the dorsal border of the caudate lobe and\r\nsoon becomes entirely embedded in the gland substance, emerging only at\r\nits passage through the diaphragm. The œsophageal notch is large and is\r\noccupied mainly by the large right crus of the diaphragm. The right\r\nlateral border extends backward to the upper part of the twelfth\r\nintercostal space or thirteenth rib. The left lateral border is opposite\r\nthe eighth rib and intercostal space. The ventral border extends\r\nbackward about as far as the umbilicus.\r\n\r\nThere are no lateral ligaments and the falciform ligament disappears\r\nearly.\r\n\r\nThe =gall-bladder= is attached in the fossa vesicæ felleæ on the right\r\ncentral lobe, at a considerable distance from the ventral border. The\r\ncystic duct joins the hepatic duct at an acute angle immediately after\r\nthe emergence of the latter from the portal fissure. The =bile-duct=\r\n(Ductus choledochus) opens at the papilla duodeni about one or two\r\ninches (ca. 2.5 to 5 cm.) from the pylorus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 324.—PROJECTION OF VISCERA OF PIG ON BODY-WALL, LEFT SIDE.\r\n\r\n  _D_, Costal line of diaphragm; _U_, ureter; _V.

For the same reason the gland tissue is much less friable than\r\nthat of the other animals, from which it is easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PANCREAS\r\n\r\nThe =pancreas= is elongated, and is situated transversely on the dorsal\r\nabdominal wall, with its right extremity on the ventral surface of the\r\nright kidney, and the left end touching the dorsal end of the spleen and\r\nthe left kidney. The right portion has two lobes; the posterior lobe\r\nbends around the great mesenteric artery and the portal vein; the\r\nanterior one is pointed, extends downward and forward about in the\r\nmedian plane, and is attached to the portal fissure and the duodenum.\r\nThe left portion is prismatic and rests mainly on the left sac of the\r\nstomach, its left extremity being included between the left kidney and\r\nthe dorsal end of the spleen. The pancreatic =duct= passes from the\r\nanterior lobe directly through the duodenal wall, opening about five or\r\nsix inches (ca. 12.5 to 15 cm.) from the pylorus. The interlobular\r\ntissue usually contains a good deal of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE SPLEEN\r\n\r\nThe =spleen= is long and narrow. Its long axis is nearly dorso-ventral\r\nin direction, and is slightly curved to conform to the left part of the\r\ngreater curvature of the stomach. The dorsal end lies under the\r\nvertebral ends of the last three ribs. The ventral end is smaller,\r\nreaches to the ventral abdominal wall, and lies against the left lobe of\r\nthe liver. The visceral surface has a longitudinal ridge on which the\r\nhilus is situated; this divides the surface into nearly equal gastric\r\nand intestinal areas. The spleen is attached so loosely to the stomach\r\nthat it may be regarded as being intercalated in the great omentum. In\r\nlarge subjects it may reach a length of 15 to 18 inches (ca. 38 to 45\r\ncm.) and a width of 3 to 4 inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF THE DOG\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE MOUTH\r\n\r\nThe size and form of the mouth vary greatly in different breeds, the\r\ncavity being in some long and narrow, in others short and wide. The\r\n=rima oris= is very extensive, so that the labial commissure is opposite\r\nthe third or fourth cheek tooth. The =lips= are thin and mobile, and\r\npresent numerous tactile hairs. The upper lip has a small, central, bare\r\narea which forms part of the muzzle, and is marked by a central groove,\r\nthe philtrum, or (as in the bulldog) a fissure, giving the appearance of\r\nharelip. The lateral borders of the lower lip are flaccid and\r\ndenticulated. The mucous membrane is usually pigmented and forms\r\ndistinct frena labiorum. The labial glands are small and scanty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 326.—TONGUE OF DOG. _a_, Tonsil; _b_, vallate papillæ; _c_,\r\n    foliate papilla; _d_, fungiform papillæ; _e_, median groove of\r\n    dorsum; _f_, epiglottis; _g_, soft papillæ of root; _h_, middle\r\n    glosso-epiglottic fold; _1_, tip; _2_, root. (Ellenberger-Baum,\r\n    Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =cheeks= are loose and capacious, and their mucous lining is smooth\r\nand more or less pigmented. The =parotid duct= opens usually opposite\r\nthe third upper cheek tooth. Near the last tooth are the openings of the\r\nfour or five ducts from the orbital gland.\r\n\r\nThe =hard palate= is widest between the fourth pair of cheek teeth. It\r\nhas eight to ten curved ridges on either side of the raphé. Behind the\r\nfirst pair of incisor teeth is the triangular incisive papilla, at which\r\nthe naso-palatine ducts open. The mucous membrane is usually pigmented.\r\n\r\nThe =soft palate= is thick except at its margins. In the resting state\r\nof the parts it comes in contact with the oral surface of the\r\nepiglottis. Between its anterior and posterior pillars on either side is\r\na marked tonsillar sinus, in which an elongated =tonsil= is situated;\r\nthis is reddish in color, about an inch long, and projects somewhat into\r\nthe fauces between two folds of mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nThe =tongue= is wide, thin, and very mobile. It is not pigmented, but\r\nhas a bright red color. The upper surface is marked by a median groove\r\n(Sulcus medianus linguæ), and is thickly beset with short, pointed,\r\nfiliform papillæ, the free ends of which are directed backward. On the\r\nroot the papillæ are long and soft; similar papillæ occur on the lateral\r\nwalls of the isthmus faucium. The fungiform papillæ are small, and are\r\nscattered over the dorsum and sides of the tongue, but are absent on the\r\nroot. There are usually two or three vallate papillæ on either side.\r\nSmall foliate papillæ are also present. In the inferior part of the tip\r\nof the tongue is the =lyssa=, a fusiform cord, composed of fibrous\r\ntissue, muscular tissue, and fat. In large dogs it is about two inches\r\n(ca. 4 to 5 cm.) long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 327.—SKULL OF ADULT ST. BERNARD DOG, SCULPTURED TO SHOW THE\r\n    EMBEDDED PARTS OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\n  _I1–3_, Incisors; _C_, canines; _P1–4_, premolars; _M1–3_, molars.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE TEETH\r\n\r\nThe formula for the permanent teeth is:\r\n\r\n                         (   3   1   4   2 )\r\n                       2 ( I - C - P - M - ) = 42\r\n                         (   3   1   4   3 )\r\n\r\nAll of the teeth have short crowns and distinct necks; they erupt\r\nrapidly. The crowns are white, being destitute of cement.\r\n\r\nThe =incisors= are placed almost vertically and close together in the\r\njaw-bones. They do not correspond to an opposing tooth, but rather to\r\nparts of two teeth of the other jaw. The crowns are trituberculate, the\r\ncentral projection being the largest. They increase in size from the\r\nfirst to the third. The labial surface is convex, the lingual slightly\r\nconcave, and marked off from the neck by a =V=-shaped ridge, the\r\ncingulum. The roots are flattened transversely. The lower incisors are\r\nsmaller than the upper ones. One or two supernumerary teeth may be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 328.—BASE OF SKULL OF COCKER SPANIEL.\r\n\r\n  _I1–3_, Incisors; _C_, canine; _P1–4_, premolars; _M1–2_, molars. Note\r\n    the crowding of the canines and premolars on account of the\r\n    shortness of the jaw.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =canine teeth= are large, conical, and curved. The upper canine is\r\nseparated from the corner incisor by an interval into which the lower\r\ncanine is received when the jaws are closed.[115] The lower canine is\r\nclose to the corner incisor. The root is about an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.)\r\nlong and is flattened laterally.\r\n\r\nThe =cheek teeth= are typically ⁶⁄₇, but in brachycephalic breeds they\r\nare commonly reduced to ⁵⁄₇, and in extreme cases even to ⅘. The\r\nreduction occurs at either end or at both ends of the series.[116] The\r\nfirst tooth appears only once. The fourth tooth of the upper row and the\r\nfifth of the lower row are much larger than the rest, and termed\r\n=sectorial= or =carnassial= teeth. From these the teeth diminish in size\r\nboth forward and backward. The upper and lower teeth do not correspond,\r\nbut rather dovetail. The teeth behind the sectorial ones are\r\ntuberculate, _i. e._, have rounded eminences on the masticatory surface.\r\nThe others are all sectorial in character, _i. e._, have sharp-edged,\r\npointed projections, the middle one being the most prominent. The\r\npremolars are laterally compressed, and are separated by intervals from\r\nthe canines and from each other, except in the brachycephalic breeds.\r\nThe upper molars have wide, somewhat quadrangular crowns, and three\r\nroots. The crown of the upper fourth premolar (Dens sectorius) is\r\ndivided into two pointed lobes and has an antero-internal tubercle; it\r\nhas three roots. The crown of the first lower molar (Dens sectorius) is\r\ncompressed laterally and has two pointed, sharp-edged lobes, behind\r\nwhich are one or two tubercles; it has two roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 329.—DISSECTION OF HEAD OF DOG, SHOWING SALIVARY GLANDS, ETC.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Ocular muscles; _b_, pterygoideus internus (cut); _c_,\r\n    stylo-glossus; _d_, digastricus (cut); _e_, genio-glossus; _f_,\r\n    genio-hyoideus; _g_, hyo-glossus; _h_, thyro-pharyngeus; _i_,\r\n    crico-pharyngeus; _k_, thyro-hyoideus; _l_, zygomatic process of\r\n    temporal (sawn off); _1_, parotid gland; _2_, submaxillary gland;\r\n    _3_, posterior part of sublingual gland; _3′_, anterior part of\r\n    same; _4_, submaxillary duct; _5_, ductus sublingualis major; _6_,\r\n    palatine glands; _7_, orbital or zygomatic gland; _8_, ducts of _7_;\r\n    _9_, lacrimal gland.

Its upper part is wide and is divided into\r\ntwo lobes by a deep notch into which the base of the ear is received.\r\nThe lower end is small and overlaps the submaxillary gland. The =duct=\r\nleaves the gland at its anterior border, crosses the masseter muscle,\r\nand opens into the mouth opposite the third upper cheek tooth. Small\r\naccessory glands (Glandulæ parotidæ accessoriæ) are sometimes found\r\nalong the course of the duct.\r\n\r\nThe =submaxillary gland= is usually larger than the parotid. In large\r\ndogs it is about two inches (ca. 5 cm.) long and an inch or more (ca. 3\r\ncm.) wide. It is rounded in outline and of a pale yellow color. Its\r\nupper part is covered by the parotid, but it is otherwise superficial,\r\nand is palpable in the angle of junction of the jugular and external\r\nmaxillary veins. The =duct= leaves the deep face of the gland, passes\r\nalong the surface of the digastricus and stylo-glossus, and opens into\r\nthe mouth near the frenum linguæ on a very indistinct papilla.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 330.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF PHARYNGEAL AND LARYNGEAL REGIONS OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Œsophagus; _2_, larynx; _3_, mouth cavity; _4_, epiglottis; _5_,\r\n    arytenoid cartilage; _6_, soft palate; _6″_, position of soft palate\r\n    when raised; _7_, vomer; _8_, base of cranium; _9_, root of tongue;\r\n    _a_, _a′_, _a″_, pharynx; _b_, fornix of pharynx; _c_, posterior\r\n    wall of pharynx; _d_, floor of pharynx; _e_, pharyngeal surface of\r\n    soft palate; _f_, origin of œsophagus; _g_, vestibule of larynx;\r\n    _h_, isthmus faucium; _i_, Eustachian opening; _k_, posterior naris.\r\n    (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =sublingual gland= is divided into two parts. The posterior part\r\n(Glandula sublingualis grandicanalaris) lies on the digastricus muscle\r\nin intimate relation with the submaxillary gland, but clearly separable\r\nfrom it after removal of the common fibrous capsule. It has a pointed\r\nanterior process. The =duct= (Ductus sublingualis major) accompanies the\r\nsubmaxillary duct, and usually opens beside it, but in some cases joins\r\nit. The anterior part (Glandula sublingualis parvicanalaris) is long and\r\nnarrow; it lies on the stylo-glossus muscle. It has a number (8 to 12)\r\nof small ducts (Ductus sublinguales minores), some of which open\r\ndirectly into the mouth, while others join the large duct.\r\n\r\nThe =orbital= or =zygomatic gland= (Glandula zygomatica) represents the\r\nsuperior molar glands of herbivora. It is prismatic and is situated in\r\nthe orbital region, between the zygomatic arch and the internal\r\npterygoid muscle, in contact with the periorbita. It has four or five\r\n=ducts= (Ductus zygomatici) which open near the last upper cheek tooth;\r\none of them (canal of Nuck) is almost as large as the parotid duct; the\r\nothers are small.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PHARYNX\r\n\r\nThe fornix is narrow. The orifices of the Eustachian tubes are small and\r\nslit-like; the end of the tube causes a rounded projection of the mucous\r\nmembrane (Torus tubarius). The œsophageal opening is relatively small\r\nand is encircled by a fold of the mucous membrane. The hyo-pharyngeus\r\nmuscle is clearly divided into a kerato-pharyngeus and a\r\nchondro-pharyngeus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE ŒSOPHAGUS\r\n\r\nThe =œsophagus= is relatively wide and dilatable except at its origin.\r\nThe constriction at its origin is termed the =isthmus œsophagi=. The\r\ncardiac end is slightly dilated; it joins the stomach under the tenth or\r\neleventh thoracic vertebra, slightly to the left of the median plane.\r\nThe muscular tissue is striated and consists mainly of two layers of\r\nspiral fibers which cross each other; near the cardia, however, the\r\nfibers are longitudinal and circular. There are mucous glands and lymph\r\nglands in the submucosa throughout.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 331.—STOMACH OF DOG. PARIETAL SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  Organ fixed _in situ_ when well filled.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE STOMACH\r\n\r\nThe =stomach= is relatively large. Its capacity in a dog weighing about\r\n40 pounds is about six to seven pints.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Colin estimates the average capacity at about 3 liters (ca. 6½ pints),\r\n  with a range between 0.6 and 8 liters (ca. 1⅓ to 17½ pints). Neumayer\r\n  gives the capacity as 100 to 250 c.c. per kilogram of body-weight (ca.\r\n  2.7 ounces per pound). The average capacity of the human stomach is\r\n  estimated at 35 to 40 ounces—only about one-half of that of a dog of\r\n  medium size.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen full it is irregularly pyriform. The left or cardiac part (Corpus\r\nventriculi) is large and rounded, while the right or pyloric part (Pars\r\npylorica) is small and cylindrical. When empty, or nearly so, the left\r\nsac is strongly contracted; the pyloric part is not materially affected\r\nby variations in the amount of ingesta.\r\n\r\nThe parietal surface of the full stomach is very extensive, strongly\r\nconvex, and faces partly forward, but largely to the left. It is related\r\nto the liver, the left part of the diaphragm, and the left and ventral\r\nabdominal wall as far back as a transverse section through the second or\r\nthird lumbar vertebra.\r\n\r\nThe visceral surface is much less extensive and is considerably\r\nflattened; it faces chiefly to the right, and is related to the\r\nintestine, pancreas, and left kidney.\r\n\r\nThe upper part of the lesser curvature is nearly straight and vertical,\r\nbut the lower part forms a deep, narrow angle, due to the fact that the\r\npyloric part is directed sharply forward and upward.\r\n\r\nThe greater curvature is nearly four times as long as the lesser\r\ncurvature. In the full stomach it extends considerably behind the left\r\ncostal arch (having carried the spleen backward); ventrally, it lies on\r\nthe abdominal wall, almost midway from the xiphoid cartilage to the\r\npubis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 332.—STOMACH OF DOG, VISCERAL SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  Organ fixed _in situ_ when well filled.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe left extremity or fundus is large and rounded; it is the most dorsal\r\npart of the organ, and lies under the dorsal ends of the eleventh and\r\ntwelfth ribs.\r\n\r\nThe pyloric extremity is small and is directed forward and somewhat\r\nupward; it lies usually about an inch or two (ca. 3.5 to 5 cm.) below\r\nthe cardia, a little to the right of the median plane. It is related to\r\nthe portal fissure of the liver and to the pancreas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 333.—EVERTED STOMACH OF DOG FROM WHICH THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE IS\r\n    REMOVED.\r\n\r\n  _O_, Œsophagus; _D_, duodenum; _b_, circular fibers; _c′_, internal\r\n    oblique fibers; _c″_, cardiac loop; _c‴_, transition of internal to\r\n    external oblique fibers; _d_, fibers uniting branches of cardiac\r\n    loop; _p_, pyloric sphincter; _p′_, antral sphincter.\r\n    (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 334.—DIAGRAM OF ZONES OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF STOMACH OF DOG.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cardia is situated about two to three inches (ca. 5 to 7 cm.) from\r\nthe left extremity, and is oval; it lies a little to the left of the\r\nmedian plane, below the tenth or eleventh thoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\nWhen empty, or nearly so, the stomach is separated from the ventral\r\nabdominal wall by the liver and small intestine, and the greater\r\ncurvature extends back to the eleventh or twelfth rib. In this state\r\nthere is not rarely a marked constriction between the right and left\r\nportions.\r\n\r\nThe longitudinal muscular fibers are found on the curvatures and on the\r\npyloric part. The oblique fibers are arranged in two layers: the\r\nexternal layer is a continuation of the longitudinal fibers of the\r\nœsophagus onto the body and fundus. The circular layer covers the whole\r\nstomach except the fundus, and forms a pyloric sphincter and an antral\r\nsphincter. The internal oblique layer is arranged as in the horse, and\r\nforms a similar loop-like, cardiac sphincter.\r\n\r\nThree regions of the mucous membrane exist. Cardiac glands are found in\r\na very narrow pale zone around the cardiac opening, and also scattered\r\nalong the lesser curvature. The fundus gland region has a thick,\r\nreddish-brown mucous membrane, which lines about two-thirds of the\r\norgan. The pyloric mucous membrane is thinner and pale; in the dead\r\nsubject it is often stained by regurgitated bile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 335.—ABDOMINAL VISCERA OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  Superficial ventral view after removal of the great omentum. From\r\n    photograph of formalin-hardened subject.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE INTESTINE\r\n\r\nThe intestine is short—about five or six times the length of the body.\r\n\r\nThe =small intestine= has an average length of about thirteen feet (ca.\r\n4 meters). It occupies most of the abdominal cavity behind the liver and\r\nstomach. The duodenum begins at the portal fissure and passes backward\r\nand upward, at first on the visceral surface of the liver, then in\r\ncontact with the right flank. Near the pelvis it turns inward and\r\nsharply forward, passes along the inner border of the left kidney, and\r\njoins the jejunum to the left of the root of the mesentery. The\r\nmesoduodenum is given off from the common mesentery; it is a relatively\r\nwide fold, except at the terminal part. Here there are two short folds,\r\none of which joins the mesocolon; the other passes on to the terminal\r\npart of the colon. The first part of the mesoduodenum contains the right\r\nbranch of the pancreas. Its root is blended with the mesocolon to form a\r\ncommon mesentery. The remainder of the small intestine forms numerous\r\ncoils, and is attached by a wide mesentery to the sublumbar region. The\r\n=pancreatic= and =bile-ducts= open into the duodenum about two or three\r\ninches (ca. 5 to 8 cm.) from the pylorus; the =accessory pancreatic\r\nduct= opens an inch or two (ca. 2.5 to 5 cm.) further back. The mucous\r\nmembrane has very long villi. The duodenal (Brunner’s) glands occur only\r\nnear the pylorus. Peyer’s patches are numerous (about twenty in young\r\nsubjects), and begin in the duodenum. They are usually elliptical in\r\noutline, but the last one is band-like, reaches to the end of the ileum\r\nand is four to sixteen inches (ca. 10 to 40 cm.) long in young dogs\r\n(Ellenberger). There is an ileo-cæcal valve.[117] The muscular coat is\r\nrelatively thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 336.—DEEP DISSECTION OF ABDOMINAL VISCERA OF DOG (FEMALE).\r\n\r\n  _BL_, Bladder; _B_, body; _C_, _C′_, cornua of uterus; _O_, _O′_,\r\n    ovaries; _L. K._, left kidney. The concealed part of the colon is\r\n    indicated by dotted lines. (From photograph of formalin-hardened\r\n    subject.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =large intestine= is two to two and a half feet (ca. 60 to 75 cm.)\r\nlong. Its caliber is about the same as that of the small intestine, and\r\nit has neither longitudinal bands nor sacculations.\r\n\r\nThe =cæcum= is about three or four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) long, and is\r\ntwisted in a spiral fashion. The twist is maintained by the peritoneum,\r\nwhich attaches it to the ileum. It is situated usually against the\r\nmiddle of the upper part of the right flank, below the duodenum and the\r\nright branch of the pancreas.[118]\r\n\r\nThe =colon= is attached to the sublumbar region by a mesentery, the\r\nmesocolon. It presents three parts, which correspond to the ascending,\r\ntransverse, and descending colon of man. The first or right part (Colon\r\nascendens) is very short. It begins at the junction of the ileum and\r\ncæcum, and passes forward along the inner surface of the duodenum and\r\nthe right branch of the pancreas till it reaches the pyloric part of the\r\nstomach; here it turns inward and crosses the median plane, forming the\r\ntransverse part (Colon transversum). The third or left part (Colon\r\ndescendens) passes backward in the sublumbar region along the inner\r\nborder or ventral surface of the left kidney; then inclines toward the\r\nmedian plane and joins the rectum.[119] The caliber of the colon is\r\nabout the same throughout. It has no bands nor sacculations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 337.—CÆCUM OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Ileum; _2_, cæcum; _3_, colon.

(After P. Schumann.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe mucous membrane of the cæcum contains numerous solitary glands; they\r\nare found also in the first part of the colon.\r\n\r\nThe =rectum= is almost completely covered with peritoneum, the line of\r\nperitoneal reflection being under the second or third coccygeal\r\nvertebra. At the junction of the rectum and anus the mucous membrane has\r\na stratified, squamous epithelium, and contains the =anal glands=. A\r\nsmall opening on either side leads into two lateral =anal sacs= (Sinus\r\nparanales); these are usually about the size of a hazelnut, and contain\r\na dirty gray, fatty substance, which has a peculiar and very unpleasant\r\nodor. The skin which lines these pouches contains coil glands. Further\r\nback the skin contains large sebaceous glands and peculiar =circumanal\r\nglands=.\r\n\r\nThe retractor ani muscle is extensive. It arises from the shaft of the\r\nilium, the pubis, and the symphysis pelvis, and passes upward and\r\nbackward to end on the first coccygeal vertebræ and the sphincter ani\r\nexternus. The retractors, together with the coccygei, form a sort of\r\npelvic diaphragm, analogous to that of man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LIVER\r\n\r\nThe liver is relatively large, weighing usually about 5 per cent. of the\r\nbody-weight. It is divided into six or seven =lobes= by fissures which\r\nconverge at the portal fissure. When the gland is examined in the soft\r\ncondition, all the lobes are visible on the visceral surface, but\r\nusually only four on the parietal surface.\r\n\r\nThe =left lateral lobe= is the largest, and is oval in outline. The\r\n=left central lobe= is much smaller and is prismatic. The =right central\r\nlobe= is second in size, and presents a somewhat tongue-shaped quadrate\r\nlobe, marked off by the deep fissure in which the gall-bladder lies. The\r\n=right lateral lobe= is third in size, and is oval in outline. On its\r\nvisceral surface is the large =caudate lobe=; this consists of two\r\nparts—on the right, the caudate process; on the left, the papillary\r\nprocess or lobe, both often being subdivided by fissures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 339.—LIVER OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  Soft specimen sketched with lobes drawn apart.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 340.—LIVER OF DOG, VISCERAL SURFACE; HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n\r\n  Left central lobe, gall-bladder, and great part of right central lobe\r\n    not visible.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen hardened _in situ_ (with the stomach full), the gland presents the\r\nfollowing characters:\r\n\r\nThe visceral surface is marked by a somewhat oblique ridge\r\n(corresponding to the lesser curvature of the stomach), which separates\r\ntwo deep cavities. The depression to the left of the ridge is occupied\r\nby the body and fundus of the stomach. The depression on the right is\r\nsmaller, and is occupied by the pyloric part of the stomach, the origin\r\nof the duodenum, and the right branch of the pancreas. The gall-bladder\r\nis not visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the stomach is empty and contracted, the visceral surface of the\r\n  liver is strikingly different. There is then a shallow impression for\r\n  the left part of the stomach on the left lobe, and a large convex\r\n  area, related to the small intestine and a mass of omentum. The\r\n  pyloric and duodenal impressions are not much changed. The\r\n  gall-bladder is visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe portal fissure is very deep and might well be termed a fossa. It is\r\nbounded on the right (externally) by the caudate process, on the left\r\n(internally) by the papillary process or lobe, which is directed\r\nventrally. The hepatic artery enters at the dorsal end and the portal\r\nvein centrally, while the bile-duct leaves at the ventral part. The left\r\ncentral lobe is not visible, and the right central one is largely\r\nconcealed.\r\n\r\nThe parietal surface is extremely convex, being adapted to the diaphragm\r\nand the adjacent part of the ventral wall of the abdomen. On it all the\r\nlobes except the papillary are completely or partially visible. The\r\ngall-bladder is visible in the fissure between the quadrate and chief\r\nportions of the right central lobe.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal border presents a renal impression on its right portion. The\r\nposterior vena cava passes downward and forward at first in a deep\r\ngroove on the caudate lobe, then largely embedded in the parietal\r\nsurface of the right lateral lobe; it receives two large hepatic veins\r\njust before piercing the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe œsophageal notch is large, and is occupied on the right by the thick\r\nmargin of the hiatus œsophageus. The left border is opposite to the\r\nninth and tenth ribs; it is thin and is marked by numerous indentations.\r\nThe caudate process extends usually a little beyond the last right rib,\r\nbetween the right kidney and the right branch of the pancreas. The\r\nventral border lies on the ventral abdominal wall a variable distance\r\nbehind the xiphoid cartilage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 341.—SPLEEN OF DOG, VISCERAL SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, _a_, Ridge; _b_, ventral end; _c_, dorsal end. (After\r\n    Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =gall-bladder= lies in the fossa vesicæ felleæ, between the two\r\nparts of the right central lobe; it does not reach to the ventral border\r\nof the liver. The cystic duct joins the hepatic duct at the lower part\r\nof the portal fissure, forming with it the bile duct (Ductus\r\ncholedochus); the latter passes to the right and opens into the\r\nduodenum, about two or three inches (ca. 5 to 8 cm.) from the pylorus.\r\n\r\nOf the ligaments, the coronary and right lateral are well developed, but\r\nthe left lateral and falciform are small.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PANCREAS\r\n\r\nThe =pancreas= is =V=-shaped, consisting of two long narrow branches,\r\nwhich meet at an acute angle above the pylorus. The =right branch=\r\nextends backward above the first part of the duodenum, below the caudate\r\nlobe of the liver and the right kidney, and ends usually a short\r\ndistance behind the latter. The =left branch= passes inward and backward\r\non the visceral surface of the stomach, and ends under the left kidney.\r\nThere are two =ducts=: the larger one unites with the bile duct, while\r\nthe smaller one enters the duodenum an inch or two (ca. 3 to 5 cm.)\r\nfurther back.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE SPLEEN\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 342.—PROJECTION OF VISCERA OF DOG, (MALE) ON BODY-WALL, LEFT\r\n    SIDE.\r\n\r\n  _A_, _C_, _D_, Apical, cardiac, and diaphragmatic lobes of lung; _P_,\r\n    pericardium; _Pr_, prostate.

Costal attachment and\r\n    median line of diaphragm are dotted; also posterior contour of\r\n    stomach.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =spleen= is bright red in color in the fresh state. It is somewhat\r\nfalciform, long, and narrow; the ventral part is the widest. Its\r\nposition varies in accordance with the fullness of the stomach. When\r\nthat organ is moderately full the long axis of the spleen corresponds to\r\nthe direction of the last rib. Its parietal surface is convex and lies\r\nlargely against the left flank. The visceral surface is concave in its\r\nlength, and is marked by a longitudinal ridge, on which the vessels and\r\nnerves are situated. The dorsal end lies against the left kidney and\r\nleft crus of the diaphragm. The ventral end is a little further back,\r\nand reaches to the ventral wall of the abdomen. It is so loosely\r\nattached by the great omentum as to be regarded as an appendage of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe organs of respiration (Apparatus respiratorius) comprise the =nasal\r\ncavity=,[120] the =pharynx=, the =larynx=, the =trachea=, the =bronchi=,\r\nand the =lungs=. The lungs are the central organs in which the exchange\r\nof gases between the blood and the air takes place; the other parts of\r\nthe system are passages by which the air passes to and from the lungs.\r\nThe nasal cavity opens externally at the nostrils, and communicates\r\nbehind with the pharynx through the posterior nares (Choanæ); it\r\ncontains the peripheral part of the olfactory apparatus, which mediates\r\nthe sense of smell. The pharynx is a common passage for the air and\r\nfood—a remnant of the primitive embryonic arrangement; it has been\r\ndescribed as a part of the digestive tube. The larynx is a complex\r\nvalvular apparatus which regulates the volume of air passing through the\r\ntract; it is also the chief organ of voice. The trachea, and the bronchi\r\nformed by its bifurcation, are permanently open conducting tubes. The\r\nthorax, the pleural sacs which it contains, and the muscles which\r\nincrease or diminish the size of the cavity are also parts of the\r\nsystem. The bones, joints, and muscles of the thorax have already been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nFor topographic reasons two ductless glands, the =thyroid= and the\r\n=thymus=, are usually described in this section, although they are in no\r\nsense a part of the respiratory system.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    RESPIRATORY SYSTEM OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE NASAL CAVITY\r\n\r\nThe =nasal cavity= (Cavum nasi), the first segment of the respiratory\r\ntract, is a long, somewhat cylindrical passage, inclosed by all the\r\nfacial bones except the mandible and hyoid. It is separated from the\r\nmouth ventrally by the palate. It opens externally at the nostrils, and\r\ncommunicates posteriorly with the pharynx through the posterior nares.\r\n\r\nThe =nostrils= or =anterior nares= (Nares) are somewhat oval in outline,\r\nand are placed obliquely, so that they are closer together below than\r\nabove. They are bounded by two =alæ= or =wings= (Alæ nasi), which meet\r\nabove and below, forming the =commissures=. The outer ala is concave;\r\nthe inner one is convex above, concave below. The upper commissure is\r\nnarrow, the lower one wide and rounded. If the finger is passed into the\r\nnostril at the upper commissure, it enters the so-called =false\r\nnostril=, which leads backward to a blind cutaneous pouch. This\r\ncul-de-sac, the =diverticulum nasi=, extends backward to the angle of\r\njunction of the nasal bone and the nasal process of the premaxilla. The\r\nposterior part of the diverticulum is blind, but the false nostril\r\ncommunicates below and internally with the vestibule of the nasal\r\ncavity. The external opening of the =naso-lacrimal duct= is seen when\r\nthe nostril is dilated; it is situated on the floor of the vestibule,\r\nperforating the skin close to its junction with the mucous membrane,\r\nabout two inches (ca. 5 cm.) from the lower commissure. (It is not rare\r\nto find one or two accessory orifices further back.)\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The =skin= around the nostrils presents long tactile hairs\r\nas well as the ordinary ones. It is continued around the alæ and lines\r\nthe vestibule. In the posterior part of the diverticulum the skin is\r\nthin and usually black, and is covered with exceedingly fine hairs; it\r\nis provided with numerous sebaceous glands. The inner wing is supported\r\nby the =alar cartilage= (Cartilago alaris), which is shaped somewhat\r\nlike a comma, the convex margin being direct medially. The cartilages\r\nare attached by fibrous tissue to the extremity of the septal cartilage.\r\nEach consists of an upper, quadrilateral curved plate, the =lamina=, and\r\na narrow =cornu= which curves downward and outward, supporting the inner\r\nwing and the lower commissure, but not entering into the formation of\r\nthe outer wing. The lamina causes the projection of the upper part of\r\nthe internal wing, from which the thick =alar fold= (Plica alaris)\r\npasses backward along the external wall of the nasal cavity to cover the\r\ncartilaginous prolongation of the inferior turbinal bone. This fold\r\nseparates the true from the false nostril. The extremity of the cornu\r\nusually causes a slight projection of the skin a short distance behind\r\nand below the lower commissure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 344.—NOSTRILS OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Diverticulum nasi (shown as if distended); _b_, philtrum; _c_,\r\n    false nostril; _d_, true nostril; _e′_, prominence caused by lamina\r\n    of alar cartilage; _e″_, prominence over cornu of same; _f_,\r\n    external wing of nostril; _g_, internal wing; _h_, lower commissure;\r\n    _i_, orifice of naso-lacrimal duct.

The osseous part of the septum (Septum osseum) is formed\r\nbehind by the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid and below by the vomer.\r\nA few ridges on the former correspond to the ethmoidal meatuses. The\r\nmajor part of it, however, is formed by the =septal cartilage=\r\n(Cartilago septi nasi). The surfaces of the cartilage are marked by\r\nfaint grooves for the vessels and nerves which course over it. The\r\n=dorsal border= is attached along the frontal and nasal sutures, and\r\nextends beyond the apices of the nasal bones about two inches (ca. 5\r\ncm.). From this border a thin, narrow plate, the =parietal cartilage=\r\n(Cartilago parietalis) curves outward for a short distance on either\r\nside. Near the nostrils these plates are somewhat wider, partially\r\nmaking good the defect in the bony roof of the cavity in this situation.\r\nThe =ventral border= is thick and rounded; it lies chiefly in the groove\r\nof the vomer, but anteriorly it occupies the space between the\r\npremaxillary bones. The =posterior border= is continuous with the\r\nperpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone.[121] The alar cartilages are\r\nattached to the anterior extremity by fibrous tissue in such a manner as\r\nto allow very free movement—in fact, an actual joint may be found. The\r\nventral part of the cartilage is about half an inch (ca. 1 cm.), the\r\nmiddle part about one-tenth of an inch (ca. 2.5 mm.), and the dorsal\r\npart about a quarter to a third of an inch (ca. 6 to 8 mm.) in\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 346.—NASAL CARTILAGES OF HORSE, DORSAL VIEW. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe two =turbinal bones= (Conchæ nasales) project from the lateral wall,\r\nand divide the outer part of the cavity into three =meatuses=—superior,\r\nmiddle, and inferior.\r\n\r\nThe =superior meatus= (Meatus nasi dorsalis) is a narrow passage,\r\nbounded dorsally by the roof of the cavity, and ventrally by the\r\nsuperior turbinal bone; its posterior end is closed by the junction of\r\nthe inner plate of the frontal bone with the cribriform plate and\r\nlateral mass of the ethmoid. It transmits air to the upper part of the\r\nolfactory region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 347.—NASAL CAVITY OF HORSE, SAGITTAL SECTION WITH SEPTUM REMOVED.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Superior turbinal fold; _2_, alar fold, containing cartilaginous\r\n    prolongation of inferior turbinal; _3_, arrow pointing to\r\n    naso-maxillary fissure; _4_, cranial cavity; _5_, sphenoidal sinus;\r\n    _6_, hamulus of pterygoid bone. The olfactory mucous membrane is\r\n    shaded. Dotted lines indicate anterior limit of uncoiled parts of\r\n    turbinal bones, which inclose parts of frontal and maxillary\r\n    sinuses.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =middle meatus= (Meatus nasi medius) is between the two turbinal\r\nbones. It is somewhat larger than the superior meatus, and does not\r\nextend back so far; it ends near the great ethmoturbinal and the\r\nethmoidal meatuses. In its posterior part is found the extremely narrow,\r\nslit-like interval by which the maxillary sinus communicates with the\r\nnasal cavity—the =naso-maxillary fissure= (Aditus naso-maxillaris). The\r\nfissure is not visible from the nasal side, being concealed by the\r\noverhanging superior turbinal. A fine flexible probe, passed outward and\r\nsomewhat backward between the turbinal bones, enters the maxillary\r\nsinus; if introduced a little further in the same direction, it usually\r\npasses through the orifice of communication between the maxillary and\r\nthe frontal sinus and enters the latter. A small part of the fissure\r\nusually brings the anterior division of the maxillary sinus into\r\ncommunication with the nasal cavity. The spaces inclosed by the coiled\r\nportions of the turbinals also open into the middle meatus. This passage\r\nmay be characterized as the sinus-meatus, but it also conducts air to\r\nthe olfactory region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 348.—CROSS-SECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE. THE SECTION PASSES THROUGH\r\n    THE INTERNAL CANTHI.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Mylo-hyoideus; _2_, stylo-glossus; _3_, hyo-glossus; _4_,\r\n    genio-glossus; _5_, lingual process of hyoid bone. An arrow points\r\n    to the naso-maxillary fissure.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =inferior meatus= (Meatus nasi ventralis) is situated between the\r\ninferior turbinal and the floor of the cavity. It is much larger than\r\nthe other two, and is the direct passage between the nostrils and the\r\npharynx.\r\n\r\nThe =common meatus= (Meatus nasi communis) is situated between the\r\nseptum and the turbinals, and is continuous externally with the other\r\nmeatuses. It is very narrow dorsally, but widens ventrally.\r\n\r\nThe lateral masses of the ethmoid bone project forward into the\r\nposterior part (fundus) of the nasal cavity (Fig. 347). Between the\r\nethmoturbinals of which each mass is composed there are three principal\r\nand numerous small passages, the =ethmoidal meatuses= (Meatus\r\nethmoidales).\r\n\r\nThe =posterior nares= (Choanæ) are two elliptical orifices by which the\r\nnasal cavity and pharynx communicate. They are in the same plane as the\r\nfloor of the nasal cavity, and are separated from each other by the\r\nvomer. They are, taken together, about two inches (ca. 5 cm.) wide and\r\nthree to four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) long.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal mucous membrane= (Membrana mucosa nasi) is thick, highly\r\nvascular, and is, in general, firmly attached to the underlying\r\nperiosteum and perichondrium. It is continuous in front with the skin\r\nwhich lines the nostrils, and behind with the mucous membrane of the\r\npharynx. It is also continuous at the naso-maxillary fissure with the\r\nvery thin and only slightly vascular mucous membrane which lines the\r\nsinuses. In the anterior part of the cavity it forms prominent thick\r\nfolds on the lateral wall, which extend from the turbinal bones to the\r\nnostril. There are usually two =superior turbinal folds= which unite\r\nanteriorly. The upper one incloses a thin plate of cartilage which is\r\ncontinuous with the superior turbinal bone. The =inferior turbinal fold=\r\nis curved, and incloses an ᔕ-shaped cartilaginous plate which prolongs\r\nthe inferior turbinal bone; this fold is continuous with the alar fold\r\nof the nostril, and forms with it the upper margin of the entrance from\r\nthe true nostril to the nasal cavity. Below this there is a rounded\r\nridge produced by the nasal process of the premaxilla. The mucous\r\nmembrane of the greater part of the cavity (Regio respiratoria) is red\r\nin color, and is covered with a stratified ciliated epithelium. It\r\ncontains numerous acinous =nasal glands= (Glandulæ nasales). The\r\nsubmucosa contains rich venous plexuses which form in certain situations\r\na sort of cavernous tissue (Plexus cavernosus), composed of several\r\nstrata of freely anastomosing veins, between which there are unstriped\r\nmuscle-fibers. This arrangement is most marked in the turbinal folds, on\r\nthe lower part of the inferior turbinal bone, and the lower part of the\r\nseptum. On the posterior part of the lateral masses of the ethmoid and\r\nthe adjacent part of the superior turbinal and the septum (Regio\r\nolfactoria) the mucous membrane is brownish-yellow in color and thicker;\r\nit contains the olfactory nerve-endings in a special non-ciliated\r\nepithelium. In it are numerous =olfactory glands= (Glandulæ olfactoriæ);\r\nthese are long, tubular, and often branched.\r\n\r\nThe =vomero-nasal organ= of Jacobson (Organon vomeronasale) is situated\r\non the floor of the nasal cavity, on either side of the ventral border\r\nof the septum (Fig. 345.) It consists of a tubular cartilage lined with\r\nmucous membrane, to which fibers of the olfactory nerve may be traced.\r\nIts anterior part communicates with the nasal cavity by a slit-like\r\norifice.\r\n\r\nThe =paranasal sinuses= are described in the Osteology.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LARYNX\r\n\r\nThe =larynx= is a short tube which connects the pharynx and trachea. It\r\nis a complex valvular apparatus, which regulates the volume of air in\r\nrespiration, prevents aspiration of foreign bodies, and is the chief\r\norgan of voice.\r\n\r\nIt is situated partly between the internal pterygoid muscles, partly in\r\nthe neck between the parotid glands.[122] Its long axis is practically\r\nhorizontal when the head and neck are extended (Fig. 254).\r\n\r\nIt is related dorsally to the pharynx and the origin of the œsophagus.\r\nVentrally it is covered by the skin, fascia, and sterno-hyoid and\r\nomo-hyoid muscles. Laterally it is related to the parotid and\r\nsubmaxillary glands and to the internal pterygoid, stylo-maxillaris,\r\ndigastricus, stylo-hyoid, and pharyngeal constrictor muscles.\r\n\r\nIt is attached to the body and thyroid cornua of the hyoid bone, and\r\nthus indirectly to the base of the cranium.\r\n\r\nIts cavity communicates anteriorly with the pharynx and (potentially)\r\nwith the mouth; posteriorly, with the trachea.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the larynx consists of a framework of cartilages, connected\r\nby joints and ligaments or membranes, and moved by extrinsic and\r\nintrinsic muscles. The cavity is lined with mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        CARTILAGES OF THE LARYNX\r\n\r\nThere are three single cartilages and one pair; the single cartilages\r\nare the cricoid, thyroid, and epiglottis; the arytenoid cartilages are\r\npaired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 349.—LARYNGEAL CARTILAGES OF HORSE, RIGHT VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =cricoid cartilage= (Cartilago cricoidea) is shaped like a signet\r\nring. The dorsal part is a broad, thick, quadrilateral plate termed the\r\n=lamina=; the outer (dorsal) surface of this is marked by a median ridge\r\nseparating two shallow cavities, which give attachment to the posterior\r\ncrico-arytenoid muscles. On either side of these depressions are two\r\narticular facets. The =anterior facets= (Facies articulares arytænoideæ)\r\nare placed at the anterior border, are oval and convex, and articulate\r\nwith the arytenoid cartilages. The =posterior facets= (Facies\r\narticulares thyreoideæ) are situated on the front of a ridge, a short\r\ndistance from the posterior border; they are concave, and articulate\r\nwith the posterior cornua of the thyroid cartilage. The ventral and\r\nlateral parts of the ring are formed by a curved band, called the arch\r\n(Arcus), which is narrowest below. The lateral surfaces of the arch are\r\ngrooved for the crico-thyroid muscle. The anterior border of the lamina\r\nis thick and slightly concave; the posterior border is thin and\r\nirregularly notched. The anterior border of the arch is concave\r\nventrally and gives attachment to the crico-thyroid membrane; laterally\r\nit is thicker and gives attachment to the crico-arytenoideus lateralis\r\nmuscle. The posterior border is attached to the first ring of the\r\ntrachea by an elastic membrane. The inner surface is smooth and is\r\ncovered with mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 350.—CRICOID CARTILAGE OF HORSE, LEFT LATERAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =thyroid cartilage= (Cartilago thyreoidea) consists of a median\r\nthickened portion, termed the body, and two lateral laminæ or wings. The\r\n=body= forms ventrally a slight prominence (Prominentia laryngea), which\r\ncan be felt, but is not visible in the living subject; it supports the\r\nbase of the epiglottis, which is attached to it by an elastic ligament.\r\nThe =wings= or =laminæ= spring from the body on either side and form a\r\nlarge part of the lateral wall of the larynx. Each is a rhomboid plate,\r\npresenting a slightly convex outer surface, which is divided into two\r\nareas by an oblique line (Linea obliqua), on which the thyro-hyoid and\r\nthyro-pharyngeus muscles meet. The superior (dorsal) border is nearly\r\nstraight; it gives attachment to the pharyngeal fascia and the\r\npalato-pharyngeus muscle, and bears a cornu at each end. The =anterior\r\ncornu= (Cornu orale) is attached to the thyroid cornu of the hyoid bone;\r\nbelow it is a notch, which is converted into a foramen (Foramen\r\nthyreoideum) by a fibrous band, and transmits the superior laryngeal\r\nnerve to the interior of the larynx. The =posterior cornu= (Cornu\r\ncaudale) articulates with the cricoid cartilage. The inferior (ventral)\r\nborder is fused with the body in front; behind, it diverges from its\r\nfellow to inclose a triangular space (Incisura thyreoidea caudalis),\r\nwhich is occupied by the crico-thyroid membrane. The anterior border is\r\nslightly convex, and is attached to the hyoid bone by the thyro-hyoid\r\nmembrane. The posterior border overlaps the arch of the cricoid\r\ncartilage, and gives attachment to the crico-thyroid muscle. The inner\r\nsurface is concave, and is covered by mucous membrane to a small extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 351.—THYROID CARTILAGE OF HORSE, VENTRAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =epiglottis= (Cartilago epiglottica) is situated above the body of\r\nthe thyroid cartilage and curves toward the root of the tongue. It is\r\nshaped somewhat like a pointed ovate leaf, and presents two surfaces,\r\ntwo borders, a base, and an apex. The =oral= (or anterior) =surface= is\r\nconcave in its length, convex transversely; the =pharyngeal= (or\r\nposterior) =surface= has the reverse configuration. The =borders= are\r\nthin, denticulated, and somewhat everted. The =base= is thick, and is\r\nattached to the dorsal surface of the body of the thyroid cartilage by\r\nelastic tissue. From each side of it a cartilaginous bar projects\r\nbackward; these processes correspond to the cuneiform cartilages of man.\r\nThe =apex= is pointed and curved ventrally. Nearly all of the epiglottis\r\nis covered with mucous membrane. It lies sometimes in front of,\r\nsometimes behind, the soft palate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 352.—EPIGLOTTIS OF HORSE, RIGHT LATERAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =arytenoid cartilages= (Cartilagines arytenoideæ) are situated on\r\neither side, in front of the cricoid, and partly between the alæ of the\r\nthyroid cartilage. They are somewhat pyramidal in form, and may be\r\ndescribed as having two surfaces, two borders, a base, and an apex. The\r\n=internal surface= is concavo-convex, smooth, and covered by mucous\r\nmembrane. The =external surface= is divided by a ridge into two areas:\r\nthe lower flat area faces outward, and is covered by the thyro-arytenoid\r\nand lateral crico-arytenoid muscles; the upper concave area faces\r\nchiefly forward, and is covered by the transverse arytenoid muscle. The\r\n=anterior border= is convex, and at the base of the cartilage forms a\r\nprojection termed the =vocal process= (Processus vocalis); it is so\r\nnamed because it gives attachment to the vocal or thyro-arytenoid\r\nligament, which forms the basis of the true vocal cord. The =posterior\r\nborder= is straight, and extends from the vocal process to the facet on\r\nthe base. The =dorsal border= forms a deep notch with the apex. The\r\n=base= is concave and faces chiefly backward; it presents an oval,\r\nconcave facet for articulation with the anterior border of the lamina of\r\nthe cricoid cartilage. The external angle of the base forms a strong\r\neminence termed the =muscular process= (Processus muscularis), which\r\ngives attachment to the crico-arytenoid muscles. The internal angle is\r\nattached to its fellow by the transverse arytenoid ligament. The =apex=\r\n(Cartilago corniculata) curves upward and backward, forming with its\r\nfellow the pitcher-shaped lip, from which the cartilages derive their\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 353.—LEFT ARYTENOID CARTILAGE OF HORSE, INNER VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cricoid and thyroid cartilages, and the greater part of the\r\narytenoid cartilages, consist of hyaline cartilage. The apices and vocal\r\nprocesses of the arytenoid cartilages and the epiglottis (including the\r\ncuneiform processes) consist of elastic cartilage; they show no tendency\r\ntoward ossification at any age. The thyroid and cricoid cartilages\r\nregularly undergo considerable ossification; the process begins in the\r\nbody of the thyroid, and often involves the greater part of the\r\ncartilage.\r\n\r\n\r\n             JOINTS, LIGAMENTS, AND MEMBRANES OF THE LARYNX\r\n\r\nThe =crico-thyroid joints= (Articulationes crico-thyreoideæ) are\r\ndiarthroses formed by the apposition of the convex facets on the ends of\r\nthe posterior cornua of the thyroid cartilage with corresponding facets\r\non the sides of the cricoid cartilage. The =capsule= is thin, but is\r\nstrengthened by accessory bands dorsally, externally, and internally.\r\nThe movements are chiefly rotation around a transverse axis passing\r\nthrough the centers of the two joints.\r\n\r\nThe =crico-arytenoid joints= (Articulationes crico-arytænoidea) are also\r\ndiarthrodial. They are formed by the apposition of the convex facets on\r\nthe anterior border of the cricoid cartilages with the concave facets on\r\nthe bases of the arytenoid cartilages. Each has a very thin, loose\r\n=capsule=, strengthened by accessory bundles dorsally and internally.\r\nThe movements are gliding and rotation. In the former the arytenoid\r\ncartilage glides inward or outward; in the latter it rotates around a\r\nlongitudinal axis, so that the vocal process swings outward or inward.\r\n\r\nThe =thyro-hyoid joints= (Articulationes hyo-thyreoideæ) are formed by\r\nthe anterior cornua of the thyroid cartilage and the extremities of the\r\nthyroid cornua of the hyoid bone. They permit rotation around a\r\ntransverse axis passing through the two joints.\r\n\r\nThe =crico-thyroid membrane= (Ligamentum crico-thyreoideum) occupies the\r\nthyroid notch and extends backward to the arch of the cricoid cartilage.\r\nIt is triangular in form, and is attached by its base to the anterior\r\nborder of the arch of the cricoid cartilage, while its borders are\r\nattached to the margins of the thyroid notch. It is strong, tightly\r\nstretched, and composed largely of elastic tissue. It is reinforced\r\nventrally by longitudinal fibers, dorsally by fibers which stretch\r\nacross the thyroid notch.\r\n\r\nThe =thyro-hyoid membrane= (Membrana hyo-thyreoidea) connects the\r\nanterior border of the thyroid cartilage with the body and thyroid\r\ncornua of the hyoid bone.\r\n\r\nThe =hyo-epiglottic ligament= (Ligamentum hyo-epiglotticum) attaches the\r\nlower part of the oral surface of the epiglottis to the body of the\r\nhyoid bone. It forms an elastic sheath for the hyo-epiglottic muscle.\r\nVentrally it blends with the thyro-hyoid membrane, and dorsally it is\r\nnot well defined.\r\n\r\nThe =thyro-epiglottic ligament= (Ligamentum thyreo-epiglotticum) is\r\nstrong and thick; it is composed chiefly of elastic tissue. It connects\r\nthe base of the epiglottis with the body and the adjacent inner surface\r\nof the laminæ of the thyroid cartilage. Other fibers attach the\r\ncuneiform processes somewhat loosely to the thyroid laminæ.\r\n\r\nThe =transverse arytenoid ligament= (Ligamentum arytænoideum\r\ntransversum) is a slender band which connects the inner angles of the\r\nbases of the arytenoid cartilages.\r\n\r\nThe =vocal= (or inferior thyro-arytenoid) =ligament= (Ligamentum vocale)\r\nforms the basis of the true vocal cord (Fig. 254). It is elastic and is\r\nattached ventrally to the body of the thyroid cartilage and the\r\ncrico-thyroid membrane close to its fellow of the opposite side, and\r\nends dorsally on the processus vocalis of the arytenoid cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =ventricular= (or superior thyro-arytenoid) =ligament= (Ligamentum\r\nventriculare) is included in the false vocal cord. It consists of\r\nloosely arranged bundles which arise chiefly from the cuneiform process\r\nand end on the outer surface of the processus vocalis and adjacent part\r\nof the arytenoid cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =crico-tracheal membrane= (Ligamentum crico-tracheale) connects the\r\ncricoid cartilage with the first ring of the trachea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX\r\n\r\n\r\n                          A. EXTRINSIC MUSCLES\r\n\r\nThe =sterno-thyro-hyoideus= is described on p. 226.\r\n\r\nThe =thyro-hyoideus= (M. hyo-thyreoideus) is a flat, quadrilateral\r\nmuscle, which lies on the outer surface of the thyroid lamina and the\r\nlateral part of the thyro-hyoid membrane. It arises from the thyroid\r\ncornu of the hyoid bone, and ends on the oblique line on the lamina of\r\nthe thyroid cartilage. Its action is to draw the larynx toward the root\r\nof the tongue.\r\n\r\nThe =hyo-epiglotticus= (M. hyo-epiglotticus) is a feeble muscle which\r\noccupies a median position above the central part of the thyro-hyoid\r\nmembrane, inclosed by an elastic sheath, the hyo-epiglottic ligament. It\r\narises from the body of the hyoid bone by two branches which unite and\r\nare inserted into the front of the base of the epiglottis. Its action is\r\nto draw the epiglottis toward the root of the tongue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 354.—LARYNGEAL MUSCLES OF HORSE, SEEN FROM LEFT SIDE AFTER\r\n    REMOVAL OF MAJOR PART OF LAMINA OF THYROID CARTILAGE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Kerato-hyoideus; _b_, thyro-hyoideus; _c_, crico-thyroideus; _d_,\r\n    sterno-thyroideus; _e_, ventricularis; _f_, vocalis; _g_,\r\n    crico-arytenoideus lateralis; _h_, crico-arytenoideus post. _s_,\r\n    dorsalis; _i_, arytenoideus transversus; _1_, lingual process; _2_,\r\n    small cornu; _3_, thyroid cornu, of hyoid bone; _4_, thyroid\r\n    cartilage; _5_, cricoid cartilage; _6_, epiglottis; _7_, apex of\r\n    arytenoid cartilage; _8_, trachea; _9_, muscular process of\r\n    arytenoid; _10_, lateral lobe of thyroid gland; _10′_, isthmus of\r\n    thyroid gland; _11_, laryngeal saccule.

INTRINSIC MUSCLES\r\n\r\nThe =crico-thyroideus= (M. crico-thyreoideus) is a short muscle which\r\nfills the groove on the lateral surface of the cricoid cartilage; its\r\nfibers are directed dorsally and somewhat forward. It arises on the\r\nlower half of the lateral surface and posterior edge of the cricoid\r\ncartilage, and is inserted into the posterior border and adjacent part\r\nof the surfaces of the lamina of the thyroid cartilage. Its action is to\r\ndraw the thyroid cartilage and the ventral part of the cricoid cartilage\r\ntogether. In this action the cricoid cartilage is probably rotated,\r\ncarrying the bases of the arytenoid cartilages with it and thus tensing\r\nthe vocal cords.\r\n\r\nThe =crico-arytenoideus dorsalis s. posterior= (M. crico-arytænoideus\r\ndorsalis) is a strong, somewhat fan-shaped muscle, which, with its\r\nfellow, covers the dorsal surface of the lamina of the cricoid\r\ncartilage. It is partially divisible into two layers. It has a broad\r\norigin on half of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage, and its fibers\r\nconverge to be inserted into the processus muscularis of the arytenoid\r\ncartilage. Its action is to dilate the rima glottidis by rotating the\r\narytenoid cartilage so as to carry the vocal process and cord outward.\r\n\r\nThe =crico-arytenoideus lateralis= (M. crico-arytænoideus lateralis)\r\nlies on the inner face of the thyroid lamina. It arises from the\r\nanterior border of the lateral part of the arch of the cricoid\r\ncartilage. The fibers pass in a dorsal direction and converge on the\r\nprocessus muscularis of the arytenoid cartilage. It closes the rima\r\nglottidis by rotating the arytenoid cartilage inward.\r\n\r\nThe =arytenoideus transversus= (M. arytænoideus transversus) is an\r\nunpaired muscle which stretches across the concave dorsal surface of the\r\narytenoid cartilages. Its fibers are attached on either side to the\r\nprocessus muscularis and the ridge which extends forward from it. The\r\nright and left parts of the muscle meet at a fibrous raphé which is\r\nconnected with the transverse arytenoid ligament. Filters of the\r\nthyro-arytenoideus muscle overlap its anterior part. It narrows the rima\r\nby drawing the arytenoid cartilages together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 355.—ADITUS LARYNGIS OF HORSE, EXPOSED BY OPENING PHARYNX AND\r\n    BEGINNING OF ŒSOPHAGUS ALONG MEDIAN DORSAL LINE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, False vocal cord; _2_, lateral ventricle; _3_, true vocal cords;\r\n    _4_, rima glottidis.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =thyro-arytenoideus= (Mm. ventricularis et vocalis) is situated in\r\nthe lateral wall of the larynx, covered by the lamina of the thyroid\r\ncartilage. It consists of two parts, between which the mucous membrane\r\nof the lateral ventricle pouches to form the saccule. The =anterior\r\npart= (M. ventricularis) arises from the anterior part of the\r\ncrico-thyroid membrane and the ventral border of the thyroid lamina. Its\r\nfibers pass upward and backward to end partly on the processus\r\nmuscularis, partly on the arytenoideus transversus, meeting its fellow.\r\nThe =posterior part= (M. vocalis) has a more extensive origin on the\r\ncrico-thyroid membrane. Its direction corresponds with that of the true\r\nvocal cord. It is inserted into the outer surface of the arytenoid\r\ncartilage below the processus muscularis. The muscle closes the rima and\r\nslackens the vocal cords. With the arytenoideus transversus and\r\ncrico-arytenoideus lateralis it forms a sphincter which closes the\r\nentrance to the larynx.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CAVITY OF THE LARYNX\r\n\r\nThe =cavity= of the larynx (Cavum laryngis) is smaller than one would\r\nexpect from its external appearance. On looking into it through the\r\npharyngeal end two folds are seen projecting from its lateral walls.\r\nThese are termed the =vocal cords=, and they divide the cavity into two\r\nportions.\r\n\r\nThe =aditus laryngis=, or pharyngeal aperture, is a large, oblique, oval\r\nopening, which faces forward and upward into the ventral part of the\r\npharynx. It is bounded in front by the epiglottis, behind by the\r\narytenoid cartilages, and laterally by the aryteno-epiglottic folds of\r\nmucous membrane (Plicæ aryepiglotticæ), which stretch between the edges\r\nof the epiglottis and the arytenoid cartilages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 356.—SECTION OF LARYNX OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The plane of the section is parallel with the vocal cords.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =vestibule= of the larynx (Vestibulum laryngis) is that part of the\r\ncavity which extends from the aditus to the vocal cords. On its lateral\r\nwalls are the =false vocal cords= (Plicæ ventriculares), each of which\r\nconsists of a fold of mucous membrane covering the anterior part of the\r\nthyro-arytenoid ligament and the cuneiform process. Between the false\r\nand true vocal cord there is a pocket-like depression termed the\r\n=lateral ventricle= of the larynx (Ventriculus lateralis laryngis). This\r\nis the entrance to the =laryngeal saccule= (Appendix ventriculi\r\nlaryngis), a cul-de-sac of the mucous membrane which is about one inch\r\n(ca. 2 to 3 cm.) long and extends upward and backward on the inner\r\nsurface of the thyroid lamina. There is a small =middle ventricle=\r\n(Ventriculus laryngis medianus) at the base of the epiglottis.\r\n\r\nThe middle, narrow part of the cavity is termed the =glottis= or =rima\r\nglottidis=.[123] It is bounded on either side by the true vocal cord and\r\nthe inner surface of the arytenoid cartilage. The =true vocal cords=\r\n(Labia vocales) are situated behind the false cords and the lateral\r\nventricles. They extend from the angle between the body and laminæ of\r\nthe thyroid cartilage to the vocal processes of the arytenoid\r\ncartilages. They are prismatic in cross-section, and their free edges\r\nlook forward and somewhat upward. The mucous membrane of the cord (Plica\r\nvocalis) is very thin and smooth, and is intimately attached to the\r\nunderlying ligament. In ordinary breathing the rima is somewhat\r\nlanceolate in form; when dilated, it is diamond-shaped, the widest part\r\nbeing between the vocal processes. The narrow part of the glottis\r\nbetween the vocal cords is termed the glottis vocalis (Pars\r\nintermembranacea), while the wider part between the arytenoid cartilages\r\nis the glottis respiratoria (Pars intercartilaginea).\r\n\r\nThe =posterior compartment= of the laryngeal cavity is directly\r\ncontinuous with the trachea. It is inclosed by the cricoid cartilage and\r\nthe crico-thyroid membrane. It is oval in form, the transverse diameter\r\nbeing an inch and a half to two inches (ca. 4 to 5 cm.), and the\r\ndorso-ventral diameter two to two and a half inches (ca. 5 to 6 cm.).\r\n\r\nThe =mucous membrane= which lines the larynx (Tunica mucosa laryngis) is\r\nreflected around the margin of the aditus to become continuous with that\r\nof the pharynx, and behind it is continuous with that which lines the\r\ntrachea. It is closely attached to the pharyngeal surface of the\r\nepiglottis, but elsewhere in the aditus and vestibule it is loosely\r\nattached by submucous tissue which contains many elastic fibers.[124] It\r\nis thin and very closely adherent over the vocal cords and the inner\r\nsurfaces of the arytenoid cartilages. The epithelium is of the\r\nstratified squamous type from the aditus to the glottis, beyond which it\r\nis columnar ciliated in character. There are numerous =mucous glands=\r\n(Glandulæ laryngeæ), except over the glottis and the pharyngeal surface\r\nof the epiglottis, in which situations they are scanty.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Thyro-laryngeal artery.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Superior laryngeal and recurrent laryngeal nerves (from\r\nthe vagus).\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE TRACHEA\r\n\r\nThe =trachea= extends from the larynx to the roots of the lungs, where\r\nit divides into the right and left bronchi. It is kept permanently open\r\nby a series of about fifty to fifty-five incomplete cartilaginous rings\r\nembedded in its wall. It occupies a median position, except near its\r\ntermination, where it is pushed a little to the right by the arch of the\r\naorta. It is approximately cylindrical, but its cervical portion is for\r\nthe most part depressed dorso-ventrally by contact with the longus colli\r\nmuscle, so that the dorsal surface is flattened. The average caliber is\r\nabout two to two and one-half inches (ca. 5 to 6 cm.), but in the\r\ngreater part of the neck the transverse diameter is greater and the\r\ndorso-ventral smaller. It is inclosed by a fascia propria.\r\n\r\nIn its =cervical part= the trachea is related dorsally to the œsophagus\r\nfor a short distance, but chiefly to the longus colli muscle. Laterally\r\nit is related to the thyroid gland, the carotid artery, the jugular\r\nvein, the vagus, sympathetic, and recurrent laryngeal nerves, and the\r\ntracheal lymph ducts and cervical lymph glands. The œsophagus lies on\r\nits left face from the third cervical vertebra backward. The\r\nsterno-cephalicus muscles cross it very obliquely, passing from the\r\nventral surface forward over its sides, and diverging to reach the\r\nangles of the jaw. The omo-hyoidei also cross it very obliquely, passing\r\nover the lateral surfaces of the tube, and converging ventrally to the\r\nbody of the hyoid bone. The sterno-thyrohyoideus lies on the ventral\r\nsurface.[125] The scaleni lie on either side near the entrance to the\r\nthorax.\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic part= of the trachea passes backward between the pleural\r\nsacs and divides into the two bronchi over the left atrium of the heart.\r\nIt is related dorsally to the longus colli for a short distance, and\r\nbeyond this to the œsophagus. Its left face is crossed by the aortic\r\narch, the left brachial artery, and the thoracic duct. Its right face is\r\ncrossed by the vena azygos, the dorso-cervical and vertebral vessels,\r\nand the right vagus nerve. Ventrally it is related to the anterior vena\r\ncava, the brachiocephalic and common carotid trunks, and the left\r\nrecurrent nerve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 357.—CROSS-SECTION OF VENTRAL PART OF NECK OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The section is cut at right angles to the long axis of the neck,\r\n    passing through the junction of the second and third cervical\r\n    vertebræ. _S.c._, Spinal cord; _S.v._, spinal vein; _V.v._, _V.a._,\r\n    vertebral vein and artery; _T.p._, transverse process (tip); _F_,\r\n    intervertebral fibro-cartilage; _T_, atlantal tendon common to\r\n    mastoido-humeralis, splenius, and lower part of trachelo-mastoideus;\r\n    _M_, digitation of mastoido-humeralis inserted by _T_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =bifurcation= of the trachea (Bifurcatio tracheæ) is situated\r\nopposite to the fifth intercostal space, and about five or six inches\r\n(ca. 12 to 15 cm.) below the seventh and eighth thoracic vertebræ.\r\n\r\nThe trachea is composed of—(1) A fibro-elastic membrane in which are\r\nembedded (2) the cartilaginous rings; (3) a muscular layer; (4) the\r\nmucous membrane. The =elastic membrane= is intimately attached to the\r\nperichondrium of the rings. In the intervals between the latter it\r\nconstitutes the annular ligaments (Ligamenta annularia). The =rings= of\r\nthe trachea (Cartilagines tracheales) are composed of hyaline cartilage.\r\nThey are incomplete dorsally, and when their free ends are drawn apart,\r\nresemble somewhat the letter C. In the cervical part the thin wide free\r\nends overlap, while in the thoracic part they do not meet; here the\r\ndeficiency is made up by thin plates of variable size and form, embedded\r\nin a membrana transversa. Ventrally the rings are about one-half inch\r\n(ca. 1 to 1.2 cm.) wide and much thicker than dorsally. The first ring\r\nis attached to the cricoid cartilage by the crico-tracheal membrane, and\r\nis usually fused dorsally with the second ring. Various irregularities,\r\nsuch as partial bifurcation or partial or complete fusion with an\r\nadjacent ring, are common. The arrangement in the terminal part is very\r\nirregular. The =muscular layer= (Musculus trachealis) consists of\r\nunstriped fibers which stretch across the dorsal part of the tube. It is\r\nseparated from the ends of the rings and the membrana transversa by a\r\nquantity of areolar tissue. When it contracts the caliber of the tube is\r\ndiminished. The =mucous membrane= is pale, normally, and presents\r\nnumerous fine longitudinal folds, in which are bundles of elastic\r\nfibers. The epithelium is stratified columnar ciliated. Numerous tubular\r\n=mucous glands= (Glandulæ tracheales) are present.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Common carotid arteries.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Vagus and sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE BRONCHI\r\n\r\nThe two =bronchi=, right and left (Bronchus dexter, sinister), are\r\nformed by the bifurcation of the trachea. Each passes backward and\r\noutward to the hilus of the corresponding lung. The right bronchus is a\r\nlittle wider and less oblique in direction than the left. They are\r\nrelated ventrally to the divisions of the pulmonary artery, and dorsally\r\nto the branches of the bronchial artery and the bronchial lymph glands.\r\nTheir structure is similar to that of the trachea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE THORACIC CAVITY\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic cavity= (Cavum thoracis) is the second in point of size of\r\nthe body cavities. In form it is somewhat like a truncated cone, much\r\ncompressed laterally in its anterior part, and with the base cut off\r\nvery obliquely.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal wall= or =roof= is formed by the thoracic vertebræ and the\r\nligaments and muscles connected with them.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral walls= are formed by the ribs and the intercostal muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral wall= or =floor= is formed by the sternum, the cartilages\r\nof the sternal ribs, and the muscles in connection therewith. It is\r\nabout one-half as long as the dorsal wall.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior wall=, formed by the diaphragm, is very oblique and is\r\nstrongly convex.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior aperture= or =inlet= (Apertura thoracis cranialis) is\r\nrelatively small, and of narrow, oval form. It is bounded dorsally by\r\nthe first thoracic vertebra and laterally by the first pair of ribs. It\r\nis occupied by the longus colli muscles, the trachea, œsophagus,\r\nvessels, nerves, and the prepectoral lymph glands.\r\n\r\nThe cavity is lined by the =endothoracic fascia= and by the =pleuræ=.\r\n\r\nA longitudinal =septum=, termed the =mediastinum= (Septum mediastinale),\r\nextends from the dorsal wall to the ventral and posterior walls, and\r\nsubdivides the cavity into two lateral chambers which contain the lungs.\r\nEach of these chambers is lined by a serous membrane called the pleura,\r\nand is called a =pleural cavity= (Cavum pleuræ). The mediastinum is, for\r\nthe most part, not median in position; this is largely due to the fact\r\nthat the largest organ contained in it, the heart, is placed more on the\r\nleft side; consequently the right pleural cavity and lung are larger\r\nthan the left. Practically all the organs in the thorax are in the\r\nmediastinal space with the exception of the lungs, the posterior vena\r\ncava, and the right phrenic nerve. The part in which the heart and the\r\npericardium are situated, together with that above it, is usually called\r\nthe middle mediastinal space; the parts before and behind this are\r\ntermed the anterior and posterior mediastinal spaces respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE PLEURÆ\r\n\r\nThe =pleuræ= are two serous sacs which line the pleural cavities and are\r\nreflected at the roots of the lungs to invest those organs. We,\r\ntherefore, distinguish =parietal= and =visceral= parts of the pleuræ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 358.—CROSS-SECTION OF THE THORAX OF NEW-BORN FOAL.\r\n\r\n  _Tr._, Trachea; _S_, left brachial artery; _B_, brachiocephalic\r\n    artery; _l.g._, lymph gland. Pleura indicated by red line.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =parietal pleura= (Pleura parietalis) lines the cavity in which each\r\nlung is situated (Cavum pleuræ). On the lateral thoracic wall it is\r\nadherent to the ribs and intercostal muscles and is termed the =costal\r\npleura= (Pleura costalis). Behind it is closely attached to the\r\ndiaphragm, forming the =diaphragmatic pleura= (Pleura diaphragmatica).\r\nThe part which is in apposition with the opposite sac or covers the\r\nmediastinal organs is termed the =mediastinal pleura= (Pleura\r\nmediastinalis); where this layer is adherent to the pericardium, it is\r\ndistinguished as =pericardiac pleura= (Pleura pericardiaca).[126]\r\n\r\nThe pleura is reflected at the root of the lung, which it covers,\r\nconstituting the =visceral= or =pulmonary pleura= (Pleura pulmonalis).\r\nBehind the root of the lung a considerable triangular area is not\r\ncovered by the pleura, the two lungs being attached to each other by\r\nconnective tissue in this situation.\r\n\r\nThe =ligament of the lung= (Lig. pulmonale) is a fold formed by the\r\nreflection of the pleura from the mediastinum and the diaphragm to the\r\nlung, behind the triangular area of adhesion just mentioned. It is seen\r\nwhen the base of the lung is drawn outward. It contains elastic tissue,\r\nespecially in its posterior part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 359.—CROSS-SECTION OF THORAX OF NEW-BORN FOAL.\r\n\r\n  _A_, Aorta; _Br._, bronchi; _P.A._, pulmonary arteries; _l_, lymph\r\n    gland; _R.A._, right atrium; _L.A._; left atrium; _R.V._, right\r\n    ventricle; _L.V._, left ventricle of heart.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe right pleura forms a special =sagittal fold= (Plica venæ cavæ) about\r\na handbreadth to the right of the median plane, which incloses the\r\nposterior vena cava in its upper edge and gives off a small accessory\r\nfold for the right phrenic nerve. The fold arises from the thoracic\r\nfloor and from the diaphragm below the foramen venæ cavæ, and intervenes\r\nbetween the mediastinal lobe and the body of the right lung. It is\r\ndelicate and lace-like.\r\n\r\nThe posterior mediastinum is very delicate below the œsophagus, and\r\nusually appears fenestrated; when these apertures are present, the two\r\npleural cavities communicate with each other.[127]\r\n\r\nThe pleural sacs contain a serous fluid, the =liquor pleuræ=; in health\r\nthere is only a sufficient amount to moisten the surface, but it\r\naccumulates rapidly after death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 360.—CROSS-SECTION OF THORAX OF NEW-BORN FOAL. Ribs are numbered.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LUNGS\r\n\r\nThe =lungs= (Pulmones) occupy much the greater part of the thoracic\r\ncavity. They are accurately adapted to the walls of the cavity and the\r\nother organs contained therein. The two lungs are not alike in form or\r\nsize, the right one being considerably larger than the left; the\r\ndifference is chiefly in width, in conformity with the projection of the\r\nheart to the left.\r\n\r\nThe lung is soft, spongy, and highly elastic. It crepitates when pressed\r\nbetween the finger and thumb, and floats in water. When the thoracic\r\ncavity of the unpreserved subject is opened, the lung collapses\r\nimmediately to about one-third of its original size, and loses its\r\nproper form; this is due to its highly elastic character and the fact\r\nthat the tension of the lung tissue caused by the air pressure in its\r\ncavities has been relieved by the external air pressure.[128]\r\n\r\nThe =color= varies according to the amount of blood contained in the\r\nlung. During life the lung has a pink color, but in subjects which have\r\nbeen bled for dissection it is light gray or faintly tinged with red. In\r\nunbled subjects it is dark red; the depth of color varies, and is often\r\nlocally accentuated by gravitation of blood to the most dependent parts\r\n(hypostasis).\r\n\r\nThe =fœtal lung=, since it contains no air and has a relatively small\r\nblood-supply, differs from that of an animal which has breathed in the\r\nfollowing respects: (1) It is much smaller; (2) it is firmer and does\r\nnot crepitate; (3) it sinks in water; (4) it is pale gray in color.\r\n\r\nIn =form= the lungs are like casts of the pleural cavities in which they\r\nare situated. When well hardened _in situ_, their surfaces present\r\nimpressions and elevations corresponding exactly to the structures with\r\nwhich they are in contact. Each lung presents two surfaces, two borders,\r\na base, and an apex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 361.—LEFT LUNG OF HORSE, COSTAL SURFACE. Specimen hardened _in\r\n    situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =costal= (or external) =surface= (Facies costalis) is convex, and\r\nlies against the lateral thoracic wall, to which it is accurately\r\nadapted.\r\n\r\nThe =mediastinal= (or internal) =surface= (Facies mediastinalis) is less\r\nextensive than the costal surface. It is molded on the mediastinum and\r\nits contents. It presents a large cavity adapted to the pericardium and\r\nheart; this is termed the =cardiac impression= (Impressio cardiaca), and\r\nis larger and deeper on the left lung than on the right. Above and\r\nbehind this is the =hilus=, at which the bronchus, vessels, and nerves\r\nenter the lungs. The bronchial lymph glands are also found here. Behind\r\nthis the two lungs are adherent to each other over a triangular area.\r\nAbove this is a groove for the œsophagus (Sulcus œsophageus), which is\r\ndeepest on the left lung. A groove for the aorta (Sulcus aortæ) curves\r\nupward and backward over the hilus, and passes backward near the dorsal\r\nborder of the lung; the curved part of the groove for the aortic arch is\r\nabsent on the right lung, on which there is a groove for the vena\r\nazygos. Anteriorly there are grooves for the trachea, the anterior\r\naorta, the anterior vena cava, and other vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 362.—LEFT LUNG OF HORSE, MEDIASTINAL AND DIAPHRAGMATIC SURFACES.\r\n\r\n  Organ hardened _in situ_. (Venous impression for common\r\n    dorso-cervico-vertebral stem.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 363.—RIGHT LUNG OF HORSE, MEDIASTINAL AND DIAPHRAGMATIC SURFACES.\r\n\r\n  Organ hardened _in situ_. _c_, _d_, Grooves for superior cervical and\r\n    dorsal veins. Arrows indicate canal for posterior vena cava between\r\n    mediastinal lobe and main part of lung.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal= (or superior) =border= (Margo obtusus) is long, thick, and\r\nrounded; it lies in the groove alongside of the bodies of the thoracic\r\nvertebræ.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral= (or inferior) =border= (Margo acutus) is thin and short.\r\nIt presents, opposite to the heart, the =cardiac notch= (Incisura\r\ncardiaca). On the left lung this notch is opposite to the third, fourth,\r\nand fifth ribs, so that a considerable area of the pericardium here lies\r\nin direct contact with the chest-wall. On the right lung the notch is\r\nless extensive, and is an intercostal space further forward.\r\n\r\nThe =base= of the lung (Basis pulmonis) is oval in outline; its surface\r\n(Facies diaphragmatica) is deeply concave in adaptation to the thoracic\r\nsurface of the diaphragm. Laterally and posteriorly it is limited by a\r\nthin =basal border= which fits into the narrow recess (Sinus\r\nphrenico-costalis) between the diaphragm and the chest-wall. The\r\nposition of this border, of course, varies during respiration. In the\r\ndeepest inspiration it may reach the bottom of this recess; in ordinary\r\ninspiration it lies about four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) from\r\nthe costal arch, to which it is nearly parallel; in ordinary expiration\r\nit lies about twice as far from the costal arch.\r\n\r\nThe =apex= of the lung (Apex pulmonis) is prismatic, narrow, and\r\nflattened transversely. It is partially marked off from the rest of the\r\nlung by the cardiac notch. It curves downward, and is related internally\r\nto the anterior mediastinum and behind to the anterior part of the\r\npericardium.\r\n\r\nIn the horse the lungs are not divided into distinct =lobes= by deep\r\nfissures, as in most mammals. In the case of the left lung there is no\r\nlobation, but the right lung presents a =mediastinal lobe=, separated\r\nfrom the body of the lung by a fissure which forms in its dorsal part a\r\ncanal for the posterior vena cava and the right phrenic nerve, inclosed\r\nin a special fold of the right pleura.[129]\r\n\r\nThe =root= of the lung (Radix pulmonis) is composed of the structures\r\nwhich enter or leave the lung at the hilus on the mediastinal surface.\r\nThese are: (1) The =bronchus=; (2) the =pulmonary artery=; (3) the\r\n=pulmonary veins=; (4) the =bronchial artery=; (5) the =pulmonary\r\nnerves=; (6) the =lymph vessels=, which open into the bronchial lymph\r\nglands. The bronchus is situated dorsally, with the bronchial artery on\r\nits upper surface and the pulmonary artery immediately below it. The\r\npulmonary veins lie chiefly below and behind the artery.\r\n\r\nThe =lobulation= of the lungs is not very evident on account of the\r\nsmall amount of interlobular tissue. The lobules appear on the surface\r\nor on sections as irregular polygonal areas of different sizes.[130]\r\n\r\n=Bronchial Branches.=—Each bronchus at its entrance into the lung gives\r\noff a branch to the apex of the lung. It is then continued backward as\r\nthe main stem bronchus, parallel with the dorsal border of the lung,\r\ngiving off branches (Rami bronchiales) in monopodic fashion; these\r\nbranch similarly and reach all parts of the lung. The right bronchus\r\ngives off a special branch to the mediastinal lobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The arrangement of the larger bronchi is not the same in the two\r\n  lungs. The right bronchus, after detaching the apical branch, gives\r\n  off a large ventral branch which shortly bifurcates. One of the\r\n  divisions passes ventrally into the part of the lung behind the\r\n  cardiac notch (homologue of cardiac lobe), while the other passes\r\n  downward and backward into the lower part of the base. The stem\r\n  bronchus then gives off the branch to the mediastinal lobe, and\r\n  divides, about six inches from the hilus of the lung, into two nearly\r\n  equal branches; the dorsal branch is a direct continuation of the\r\n  stem, the ventral one passes into the middle part of the base. The\r\n  left bronchus, after a short course, divides into two nearly equal\r\n  branches. The dorsal branch may be regarded as the continuation of the\r\n  stem; it passes backward parallel with the dorsal border of the lung,\r\n  giving off a ventral branch much further back than in the right lung.\r\n  The ventral division of the stem bronchus divides, after a very short\r\n  course, into two branches; the anterior one passes ventrally into the\r\n  homologue of the cardiac lobe, while the posterior one passes downward\r\n  and backward into the base of the lung.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =structure= of the larger bronchial tubes is, in general, similar to\r\nthat of the trachea. Their walls contain irregular plates of cartilage\r\ninstead of rings. There is a continuous layer of unstriped muscle,\r\ncomposed of circularly arranged bundles. The mucous membrane presents\r\nnumerous longitudinal folds; it contains many elastic fibers, mucous\r\nglands, and lymph nodules, and is lined by ciliated columnar epithelium.\r\nAs the tubes diminish in size the coats become thinner and the\r\ncartilages smaller; in tubes about 1 mm. in diameter the cartilages and\r\nmucous glands are absent.\r\n\r\nBy repeated branching the =interlobular bronchi= are formed, and from\r\nthese arise the =lobular bronchioles=. The latter enter a lobule and\r\nbranch within it, forming the =respiratory bronchioles=; these give off\r\nthe =alveolar ducts=, the walls of which are pouched out to form\r\nhemispherical diverticula, the =alveoli= or =air-cells=.\r\n\r\nA =lobule= of the lung, the unit of lung structure, is made up of a\r\nlobular bronchiole with its branches, and their air-cells, blood- and\r\nlymph vessels, and nerves. Between the lobules is the =interlobular\r\ntissue=, which forms the supporting framework of the lung.\r\n\r\n=Vessels of the Lungs.=—The branches of the =pulmonary artery= carry\r\nvenous blood to the lungs. They accompany the bronchi, and form rich\r\ncapillary plexuses on the walls of the alveoli. Here the blood is\r\narterialized, and is returned to the heart by the =pulmonary veins=. The\r\n=bronchial arteries= are relatively small vessels which carry arterial\r\nblood for the nutrition of the lungs. The branches of these arteries\r\naccompany the bronchial ramifications as far as the alveolar ducts, but\r\ndo not extend to the alveoli. The œsophageal artery also supplies\r\npulmonary branches (in the horse) which reach the lung by way of the\r\nligament of the latter. These branches vary much in size, and ramify\r\nchiefly in the subpleural tissue of the basal part of the lung.[131] The\r\n=lymph vessels= are numerous, and are arranged in two sets. The\r\nsuperficial set forms close networks in and under the pleura, while the\r\ndeep set accompanies the bronchi and pulmonary vessels. All converge to\r\nthe root of the lung and enter the =bronchial lymph glands=.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—The pulmonary nerves come from the vagus and sympathetic\r\nnerves. They enter at the hilus and supply branches to the bronchial\r\narteries and the air-tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE THYROID GLAND\r\n\r\nThe =thyroid gland= (Glandula thyreoidea) is a very vascular ductless\r\ngland, situated on the trachea close to the larynx. It is red brown in\r\ncolor, and consists of two =lateral lobes= and a connecting =isthmus=\r\n(Fig. 354).\r\n\r\nThe =lateral lobes= are situated on either side of the first and second\r\nor second and third rings of the trachea, to which they are loosely\r\nattached. Each is about the size of a walnut, and has a convex\r\nsuperficial face which is related to the parotid gland and the omo-hyoid\r\nmuscle, and a slightly concave, deep face, applied to the trachea.\r\n\r\nThe =isthmus= in the adult horse is usually very rudimentary. It may\r\noccur as a very narrow glandular band which connects the posterior\r\nextremities of the lateral lobes, extending across the ventral surface\r\nof the trachea, but it is frequently only a small strand of connective\r\ntissue, and sometimes is entirely absent. It may be represented by a\r\nsmall tail-like process of one lobe.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The lateral lobes vary in size and position, and are often dissimilar\r\n  on the two sides. The anterior extremity is the larger; it is rounded\r\n  and usually lies about a finger’s breadth behind the larynx, but may\r\n  be in contact with it. The posterior extremity is often produced to\r\n  form a narrow tail-like process, which is continuous with the isthmus\r\n  when one is present. In the ass and mule the isthmus is usually well\r\n  developed. There is sometimes a narrow band of thyroid tissue which\r\n  extends forward from the isthmus for a variable distance; this is\r\n  termed the pyramidal lobe. The position of the lateral lobe is\r\n  indicated approximately by the junction of the external maxillary and\r\n  jugular veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The gland is enveloped by a thin, fibrous =capsule=, from\r\nwhich =trabeculæ= pass into the gland, dividing it into =lobules=. The\r\nlobules consist of non-communicating =alveoli= or =follicles= of varying\r\nform and size. The alveoli are lined by cubical epithelium, and contain\r\na viscid colloid substance.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—The arteries are relatively very large; there are\r\nusually two thyroid arteries, which arise from the carotid and enter\r\neach extremity of the gland.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—The nerves are derived from the sympathetic system.\r\n\r\nNodules of thyroid tissue of variable size, sometimes as large as a pea,\r\nmay be found near the anterior extremity of the lateral lobes, on the\r\ncourse of the anterior thyroid artery or on the trachea, even at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the thyroid region. They are termed\r\n=accessory thyroids= (Glandulæ thyreoidæ accessoriæ).\r\n\r\nThe =parathyroids= are small glandular bodies found in the thyroid\r\nregion. They are paler and not so dense as the thyroid tissue, but often\r\ncannot be differentiated by their naked-eye appearance. In the horse\r\nthere is usually only one on each side in the connective tissue over the\r\nanterior extremity of the lateral lobe of the thyroid. They resemble in\r\nstructure embryonic thyroid tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE THYMUS GLAND\r\n\r\nThe =thymus= is a ductless gland which has a close resemblance to the\r\nlymphoid tissues. It is well developed only in late fœtal life and for a\r\nfew months after birth. After this it undergoes rapid atrophy, fatty\r\ninfiltration, and amyloid degeneration, so that in the adult it is\r\nrepresented by a thin remnant in the lower part of the anterior\r\nmediastinum or has entirely disappeared. In the new-born foal it is of a\r\ngrayish-pink color, and consists of two =lateral lobes= (Fig. 358). The\r\ngreater part of the gland is situated in the anterior mediastinum, but\r\nthe two lobes are continued into the neck by a chain of lobules which\r\nlie along the course of the carotid artery, extending sometimes as far\r\nas the thyroid gland.[132]\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The thymus is inclosed in a thin, connective-tissue\r\n=capsule=, and consists of secondary =lobules= (Lobuli thymi), of\r\nvarying shape and size, held together by areolar tissue and fat, and all\r\nattached to a cord of adenoid tissue termed the =tractus centralis=.\r\nThese lobules are subdivided into polyhedral primary lobules, which are\r\ncomposed of lymphoid tissue, and present a dark vascular =cortex=, and a\r\nlighter =medulla= that contains Hassal’s corpuscles.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Internal thoracic and carotid arteries.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Sympathetic and vagus nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      RESPIRATORY SYSTEM OF THE OX\r\n\r\nTHE NASAL CAVITY\r\n\r\nThe =nostrils=, situated on either side of the muzzle, are relatively\r\nsmall, and are much less dilatable than those of the horse. The alæ are\r\nthick and firm. The superior commissure is narrow. There is no false\r\nnostril or diverticulum nasi. The skin is smooth, bare, and moist, and\r\nthere is no clear line of demarcation between it and the nasal mucosa.\r\nThe opening of the naso-lacrimal duct is not visible, as it is on the\r\nouter wall of the nostril, and is concealed by the cartilaginous\r\nprolongation of the inferior turbinal. There are two =parietal= or\r\n=lateral cartilages= on either side, united by fibrous tissue. The\r\ndorsal cartilages are thin laminæ which curve outward and downward from\r\nthe dorsal margin of the septal cartilage; they are prolongations of the\r\nnasal bones, and carry the alar cartilages on their anterior\r\nextremities. The ventral pair are lateral continuations of the basal\r\nlamellæ of the inferior turbinals. They lie along the nasal processes of\r\nthe premaxillæ; anteriorly, they become thicker, turn a little upward,\r\nand each blends with the cartilaginous prolongation of the upper coil of\r\nthe inferior turbinal. The =alar cartilages= are of peculiar form. The\r\nlamina is oblong, and curves outward and downward from the anterior\r\nextremity of the dorsal parietal cartilage, with which it is connected.\r\nThe cornu springs from the outer part of the lamina and curves outward\r\nand upward into the outer wing of the nostril; it carries on its\r\nextremity a small transverse bar, thus having some resemblance to the\r\nfluke of an anchor.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal cavity= is short, wide anteriorly, narrow behind. It is not\r\ncompletely divided by the septum, which in its posterior third is\r\nseparated from the floor of the cavity by an interval that increases\r\nfrom before backward. The middle meatus is very narrow, and divides\r\nposteriorly into two branches; the upper division leads to the ethmoidal\r\nmeatuses, and communicates with the frontal sinus and the cavity of the\r\nsuperior turbinal. Anterior to the division are communications with the\r\nupper cavity of the ventral turbinal and the maxillary sinus. The main\r\nfacts in regard to the sinuses were stated in the osteology.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 364.—MUZZLE OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _49_, Naso-labial region; _45_, lower lip. (After Ellenberger-Baum,\r\n    Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LARYNX\r\n\r\nThe =larynx= is more compact than in the horse, and presents numerous\r\ndifferential features. The =cricoid cartilage= is compressed laterally.\r\nThe lamina is not distinctly marked off from the arch; it slopes\r\ndownward and backward and has a large median ridge. The =thyroid\r\ncartilage= is complete ventrally, _i. e._, the laminæ are united\r\nthroughout to form a long plate which is notched in front and behind;\r\nthe laryngeal prominence is small and is situated posteriorly. The\r\nheight and thickness of the cartilage increase from before backward. The\r\nposterior cornua are about an inch long, and form syndesmoses with the\r\ncricoid cartilage; the short anterior cornua unite similarly with the\r\nhyoid bone. The =epiglottis= is oval in outline and its apex is rounded;\r\nits base rests on the thyro-hyoid membrane, to which it is rather\r\nloosely attached. The cuneiform cartilages are absent. The =arytenoid\r\ncartilages= present only slight differences. The muscular process is\r\nwell developed, and the vocal process is narrow and long. The =vocal\r\ncords= project very little from the wall, so that the rima glottidis is\r\nwide; the vocal ligament is attached ventrally to the crico-thyroid\r\nmembrane; it has the form of a half tube, open behind. The =lateral\r\nventricles= are extremely shallow, and the saccules are absent. The\r\nthyro-arytenoideus muscle is not divided; it is fan-shaped, thick, and\r\nnarrow dorsally; ventrally, it is attached to the base of the\r\nepiglottis, the angle of the union of the thyroid laminæ, and the\r\ncrico-thyroid membrane. The hyo-epiglotticus muscle is large and bifid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE TRACHEA\r\n\r\nThe caliber of the trachea is relatively small, its width being about an\r\ninch and a half (ca. 4 cm.) and its height one and a half to two inches\r\n(ca. 4 to 5 cm.). The rings are smaller, and number about fifty. In the\r\nneck their free ends are separated by a varying interval, so that the\r\ntube is flattened and membranous dorsally. In the thorax the ends are in\r\napposition, so that they form a ridge dorsally. The trachea is adherent\r\nto the right lung from the second rib backward. The bifurcation is\r\nopposite the fourth intercostal space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 365.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF HEAD OF COW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cerebral hemisphere; _2_, lateral ventricle; _3_, thalamus; _4_,\r\n    corpora quadrigemina; _5_, optic chiasma; _6_, pituitary body; _7_,\r\n    pons; _8_, medulla oblongata; _9_, cerebellum; _10_, spinal cord;\r\n    _11_, ventral straight muscles; _12_, pharyngeal lymph gland; _13_,\r\n    arytenoid cartilage; _14_, epiglottis; _15_, cricoid cartilage;\r\n    _16_, vocal cord; _17_, palatine sinus; _18_, soft palate; _19_,\r\n    Eustachian opening; _C_{1}_, _C_{2}_, _C_{3}_, first, second, and\r\n    third cervical vertebræ; _B.o._, basioccipital; _Sp._, presphenoid.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE BRONCHI\r\n\r\nThere are three chief bronchi. The bronchus for the apical and the\r\nanterior cardiac lobe of the right lung is detached from the trachea at\r\na considerable distance anterior to the bifurcation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE THORACIC CAVITY AND PLEURA\r\n\r\nThe thoracic cavity is relatively small; it is especially short\r\ndorsally, and is diminished laterally by the mode of attachment of the\r\ndiaphragm to the ribs (_vide_ Myology). The endothoracic fascia is\r\nbetter developed than in the horse, and is distinctly elastic. The\r\npleura is also thick, and there are no perforations of the mediastinum.\r\nThe pleural sacs are more unequal in extent than in the horse, and the\r\nventral part of the mediastinum is further to the left; in front of the\r\npericardium it lies for the most part on the left wall of the chest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 366.—CROSS-SECTION OF THORAX OF SHEEP, PASSING THROUGH MIDDLE OF\r\n    FIFTH PAIR OF RIBS, POSTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, _1′_, Lungs; _2_, _2′_, bronchi; _3_, _3′_, pulmonary arteries;\r\n    _4_, thoracic aorta; _5_, œsophagus; _6_, lymph gland; _7_, vena\r\n    hemiazygos; _8_, posterior vena cava; _9_, large pulmonary vein;\r\n    _10_, left atrium, _11_, vena hemiazygos; _12_, left ventricle;\r\n    _13_, right ventricle; _14_, sternum; _15_, internal thoracic\r\n    vessels; _16_, sixth thoracic vertebra.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LUNGS\r\n\r\nThe difference in size between the two lungs is greater than in the\r\nhorse, the right lung weighing about half as much again as the left one.\r\nThe average weight of the lungs is about 7½ pounds (ca. 3 to 4 kg.);\r\nthey form about ¹⁄₁₇₀ of the body-weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 367.—RIGHT LUNG OF OX, COSTAL SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  Organ hardened _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 368.—RIGHT LUNG OF OX, MEDIASTINAL ASPECT.\r\n\r\n  Hardened _in situ_. _1_, Left bronchus; _2_, pulmonary veins; _3_,\r\n    pulmonary artery.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThey are divided into lobes by deep =fissures= (Incisuræ interlobares).\r\nThe =left lung= is divided into =three lobes=, named from before\r\nbackward =apical=, =cardiac=, and =diaphragmatic=. The =right lung= has\r\n=four= or =five lobes=; the =apical lobe= is much larger than that of\r\nthe left lung, and occupies the space in front of the pericardium,\r\npushing the mediastinum against the left wall;[133] the =mediastinal\r\nlobe= resembles that of the horse, while the =cardiac lobe= is often\r\ndivided by a fissure into two parts. The apical lobe of the right lung\r\nreceives a special bronchus from the trachea opposite the third rib. The\r\nright lung is adherent to the trachea from the second rib backward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 369.—LUNGS AND HEART OF SHEEP, VENTRAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  Specimen hardened _in situ_. Space between heart and lungs was\r\n    occupied by pericardium and fat.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The interlobar fissures begin at the ventral margin of the lung and\r\n  pass toward the root. Those of the left lung lie opposite to the\r\n  fourth and sixth ribs. The diaphragmatic lobe is the largest, and has\r\n  the form of a three-sided pyramid with its base resting on the\r\n  diaphragm. The cardiac lobe is prismatic and forms the posterior\r\n  margin of the cardiac notch; its long axis corresponds to the fifth\r\n  rib. The apical lobe of the left lung is small and pointed; its\r\n  ventral margin lies on the pulmonary artery and the anterior aorta;\r\n  below this the space in front of the heart is occupied by the apical\r\n  lobe of the right lung. The cardiac lobe of the right lung is much\r\n  larger than that of the left lung, and covers the right face of the\r\n  pericardium, so that the latter has no contact with the lateral wall\r\n  of the thorax.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =lobulation= is very distinct on account of the extremely large\r\namount of interlobular tissue.\r\n\r\nIn the =sheep= the costal attachment of the diaphragm resembles that of\r\nthe horse, and the basal part of the lung corresponds thereto. The\r\nlobation of the lungs resembles that of the ox, but the lobulation is\r\nvery indistinct. The pleural sacs extend under the first lumbar\r\nvertebra.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE THYROID GLAND\r\n\r\nThe lobes of the thyroid gland are more extensive and paler in color\r\nthan in the horse; they extend further forward, overlapping the\r\ncrico-pharyngeus muscle to a small extent, and come in contact dorsally\r\nwith the œsophagus. They are flattened, and have an irregular, lobulated\r\nsurface. In the young subject the isthmus is well developed, being about\r\nhalf an inch (ca. 1 to 1.5 cm.) in width.\r\n\r\nAccessory thyroids may be found, and parathyroids also occur near the\r\nposterior extremity or inner surface of the lateral lobes of the\r\nthyroid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 370.—RIGHT LUNG OF SHEEP, MEDIASTINAL ASPECT.\r\n\r\n  Hardened _in situ_. _B_, Bronchus; _P.a._, pulmonary artery; _P.v._,\r\n    pulmonary vein; _V.c._, posterior vena cava; _L.g._, bronchial lymph\r\n    gland.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE THYMUS GLAND\r\n\r\nThe thymus is pale and distinctly lobulated. It is much larger in the\r\ncalf than in the foal, weighing at five or six weeks about 15 to 25\r\nounces (ca. 425 to 600 grams). The cervical part is specially large,\r\nthick, and compact; it extends to the thyroid gland. It undergoes\r\natrophy slowly and remnants of the thoracic part often remain even in\r\nadvanced age.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     RESPIRATORY SYSTEM OF THE PIG\r\n\r\nTHE NASAL CAVITY\r\n\r\nThe =nostrils= are small, and are situated on the flat anterior surface\r\nof the =rostrum= or snout (Rostrum suis). The latter is a short\r\ncylindrical projection, with which the upper lip is fused, and is\r\ncircumscribed by a prominent circular margin. The skin on the snout is\r\nthin and highly sensitive; it presents small pores, and scattered over\r\nit are fine short hairs. In the snout between the nostrils is the =os\r\nrostri=, which is to be regarded as a special development of the\r\nextremity of the septum nasi in adaptation to the habit of rooting. A\r\nplate of cartilage, representing the lamina of the alar cartilage of the\r\nhorse, curves outward and downward from the upper part of the os rostri\r\nand a pointed bar of cartilage curves upward from the lower part of the\r\nbone in the outer wing of the nostril. The notch between the nasal bone\r\nand the premaxilla is closed in by parietal cartilages which resemble\r\nthose of the ox.\r\n\r\nThe =nasal cavity= is long and narrow. It is divided behind by a\r\nhorizontal plate into an upper olfactory part, which leads to the\r\nethmoidal meatuses, and a lower respiratory part, which is a direct\r\ncontinuation of the inferior meatus. The posterior part of the septum is\r\nmembranous.\r\n\r\nThe =turbinal bones= resemble in general those of the ox. The =superior\r\nmeatus= is exceedingly small. The =middle meatus= is a deep fissure\r\nbetween the two turbinals: it divides posteriorly into two branches; one\r\nof these extends upward and backward between the lateral mass of the\r\nethmoid bone and the superior turbinal; the other widens and joins the\r\ninferior meatus. The opening between the maxillary sinus and the middle\r\nmeatus lies in a plane through the last cheek teeth. The middle meatus\r\nis continuous with the space inclosed by the dorsal part of the inferior\r\nturbinal and with the cavity of the superior turbinal. The dorsal\r\ndivision of the middle meatus presents several openings into the frontal\r\nsinus. The =inferior meatus= is relatively roomy; it communicates with\r\nthe space inclosed by the ventral coil of the inferior turbinal. The\r\nopening of the naso-lacrimal duct is found in the posterior part of the\r\ninferior meatus. The naso-palatine duct and the vomero-nasal organ (of\r\nJacobson) resemble those of the ox.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LARYNX\r\n\r\nThe larynx is remarkable for its great length and mobility. The\r\ncartilages are more loosely attached to each other than in the other\r\nanimals. The =cricoid cartilage= is thick and compressed laterally; its\r\nlamina is long and narrow; its arch is directed obliquely downward and\r\nbackward. The =thyroid cartilage= is very long; its laminæ are united\r\nventrally and form a median ridge. The anterior cornua being absent,\r\nthere are no joints formed with the hyoid bone. The posterior cornua are\r\nbroad, bent inward, and articulate with the cricoid cartilage. The\r\n=epiglottis= is relatively very large, and is more closely attached to\r\nthe hyoid bone than to the rest of the larynx. The middle part of its\r\nbase is turned forward, and rests on the thyro-hyoid membrane; it is\r\nclosely connected with the body of the hyoid bone by the hyo-epiglottic\r\nligament and the strong hyo-epiglottic muscle.[134] The apex of the\r\n=arytenoid cartilage= is very large, and is divided into two parts at\r\nits extremity; the inner part is fused with that of the opposite\r\ncartilage. There is a small =interarytenoid cartilage= in the transverse\r\nligament. The =rima glottidis= is very narrow. The =vocal cords= are\r\ndirected obliquely downward and backward; and each is pierced by a long,\r\nslit-like opening, which leads into the large laryngeal saccule. The\r\nthyro-arytenoid or vocal ligament is similarly divided into a larger\r\nanterior and a smaller posterior part. There is a middle ventricle near\r\nthe base of the epiglottis. The thyro-arytenoid muscle is very strong\r\nand is undivided. The arytenoideus is very small. The crico-thyroid\r\nconsists of two strata; the superficial layer corresponds to the muscle\r\nof the other animals; the deep part consists of transverse fibers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRACHEA AND BRONCHI\r\n\r\nThe trachea is circular in cross-section, and contains thirty or more\r\nrings which almost meet dorsally. A special bronchus is detached for the\r\napical lobe of the right lung, as in the ox.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE LUNGS (Figs. 324, 325)\r\n\r\nThe =right lung= has =four= or =five lobes=, according to whether the\r\napical is subdivided or not. The =left lung= resembles that of the ox in\r\nform and lobation. The lobulation is distinct, but the interlobular\r\nsepta are thinner than in the ox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 371.—RIGHT LUNG OF PIG, MEDIASTINAL ASPECT.\r\n\r\n  Hardened _in situ_. _B_, Left bronchus; _V._, pulmonary veins; _A._,\r\n    pulmonary artery; _l_, lymph glands.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE THYROID GLAND\r\n\r\nThe two lobes of the thyroid are long and flattened; they are situated\r\nclose together, on the ventral surface of the trachea, extending as far\r\nforward as the cricoid cartilage. The gland is dark red in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE THYMUS\r\n\r\nThe thymus is very large, extending to the larynx or even to the\r\nsubmaxillary space in young subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     RESPIRATORY SYSTEM OF THE DOG\r\n\r\nTHE NASAL CAVITY\r\n\r\nThe =nostrils= are situated on the muzzle, with which the upper lip\r\nblends. They are shaped somewhat like a comma, with the broad part next\r\nto the septum and the narrow part directed backward and outward. The\r\nskin around the nostrils is bare, usually black, and in health moist and\r\ncool. The muzzle is marked by a median furrow (philtrum) or a deep\r\nfissure in some breeds. The cartilaginous framework is formed\r\nessentially by the septal cartilage and the parietal cartilages which\r\nproceed from it. The septal cartilage projects beyond the premaxilla,\r\nand is much thickened at its extremity; it gives off from its upper and\r\nlower margins the two parietal cartilages, which curve laterally and\r\ntoward each other. A grooved plate extends outward from the septal\r\ncartilage in the floor of the nostril, and another lamina supports the\r\nalar fold of the inferior turbinal bone.\r\n\r\nThe length of the =nasal cavity= varies greatly in different breeds,\r\ncorresponding, of course, to the length of the face. The cavity is\r\nroomy, but is very largely occupied by the turbinals and the lateral\r\nmasses of the ethmoid bone. The =middle meatus= is short and narrow, and\r\ndivides posteriorly into two branches; the upper branch leads to the\r\nethmoidal meatuses; the lower branch joins the inferior meatus. The\r\n=inferior meatus= is very small in its middle part, owing to the great\r\ndevelopment here of the inferior turbinal. The posterior part of the\r\nnasal cavity is divided by a horizontal plate, the lamina transversalis,\r\ninto an upper olfactory part and a lower respiratory part. The sinuses\r\nhave been described (_vide_ Osteology).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 372.—NASAL CARTILAGES OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Upper parietal cartilage; _b_, lower parietal cartilage; _c_,\r\n    alar cartilage. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LARYNX\r\n\r\nThe larynx is relatively short. The lamina of the =cricoid cartilage= is\r\nwide; the arch is grooved laterally. The laminæ of the =thyroid\r\ncartilage= are high, but short; they unite ventrally to form the body,\r\non which there is anteriorly a marked prominence, and posteriorly a deep\r\nnotch. The oblique line on the outer surface of the lamina is prominent.\r\nThere is a rounded notch (Fissura thyreoidea) below the short anterior\r\ncornua for the passage of the superior laryngeal nerve. The posterior\r\ncornu is strong, and has a rounded surface for articulation with the\r\ncricoid cartilage. The =arytenoid cartilages= are relatively small, and\r\nhave between them a small =interarytenoid cartilage=. The =epiglottis=\r\nis quadrilateral; its lower part or stalk is narrow, fitting into the\r\nangle of the thyroid cartilage. The =cuneiform cartilages= are large and\r\nsomewhat crescent-shaped; they are not blended with the epiglottis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 373.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF NASAL REGION OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Skin; _2_, parietal cartilage; _3_, floor of nasal cavity; _4_,\r\n    lamina transversalis; _5_, mucous membrane of hard palate; _6_,\r\n    upper lip; _7_, frontal bone; _8_, frontal sinus; _9_, cranial plate\r\n    of frontal bone; _10_, cranial cavity; _11_, dotted line indicating\r\n    anterior limit of olfactory region; _a_, superior turbinal; _b_,\r\n    inferior turbinal; _b′_, _b″_, inferior turbinal fold; _c_, _e_,\r\n    ethmoturbinals; _d_, cribriform plate of ethmoid; _f_, superior\r\n    meatus; _g_, middle meatus; _h_, inferior meatus; _i_,\r\n    naso-pharyngeal meatus. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =false vocal cords= extend from the cuneiform cartilages to the\r\nthyroid. The =true vocal cords= are large and prominent. The entrance to\r\nthe large lateral ventricle and saccule is a long slit parallel with the\r\nanterior margin of the true vocal cord.\r\n\r\nThe crico-thyroid muscle is thick. The hyo-epiglotticus is well\r\ndeveloped, and is double at its hyoid attachment. The anterior part of\r\nthe thyro-arytenoideus arises on the cuneiform cartilage. Hence Lesbre\r\nhas suggested the name cuneo-arytenoideus for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE TRACHEA AND BRONCHI\r\n\r\nThe trachea is very slightly flattened dorsally. It contains forty to\r\nforty-five =U=-shaped rings; the ends of the rings do not meet dorsally,\r\nso that here the wall of the trachea is membranous and is composed of a\r\nlayer of transverse smooth muscle-fibers outside of the rings, the\r\nfibrous membrane, and the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nThe stem bronchi diverge at an obtuse angle, and each divides into two\r\nbranches before entering the lung. The anterior branch goes to the\r\napical and cardiac lobes, the posterior one to the diaphragmatic lobe,\r\nsupplying also the mediastinal lobe of the right lung. The anterior\r\nbranch of the left bronchus crosses under the pulmonary artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE LUNGS\r\n\r\nThe lungs (Figs. 342, 343) differ in shape from those of the horse and\r\nox in conformity with the shape of the thorax, which is relatively very\r\nwide in the dog; the lateral thoracic walls are strongly curved, and the\r\ncostal surface of the lungs is correspondingly convex. There is no\r\ncardiac notch on the left lung, although a small part of the pericardium\r\nis not covered by the lung at the lowest part of the fifth and sixth\r\nintercostal spaces. On the right side the cardiac notch is opposite the\r\nfourth and fifth intercostal spaces. Each lung is divided by deep\r\nfissures into =three lobes=—=apical=, =cardiac=, and =diaphragmatic=;\r\nthe right lung has in addition a =mediastinal lobe=. The apical lobe of\r\nthe right lung is considerably larger than that of the left. The latter\r\nis often more or less fused with the cardiac lobe. Variable accessory\r\nlobes may be found. On account of the small amount of interlobular\r\ntissue the lobulation is not distinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE THYROID GLAND\r\n\r\nThe =lateral lobes= of the thyroid gland are long and narrow, and have a\r\nflattened, ellipsoidal form; they are placed on the lateral surfaces of\r\nthe trachea near the larynx. The extremities are small, the posterior\r\none often being pointed. The =isthmus= is inconstant and variable; in\r\nlarge dogs it usually has the form of a glandular band which may be\r\nnearly half an inch (ca. 1 cm.) wide; in small dogs it is usually\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\n=Accessory thyroids= are frequently present; three or four may be found\r\non either side, as well as a median one near the hyoid bone.\r\n\r\nThe =parathyroids=, about the size of millet or hemp seed, are four in\r\nnumber usually. Two are placed on the deep face of the thyroid lobes;\r\nthe others are placed laterally near the anterior extremity of the\r\nthyroid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE THYMUS\r\n\r\nThe thymus is relatively small, and is situated almost entirely in the\r\nthorax. The left lobe is much larger than the right, and extends back as\r\nfar as the sixth rib at the time of its greatest size. According to Baum\r\nthe gland increases in size during the first two weeks after birth, and\r\natrophies rapidly in the next two or three months. Traces of it are\r\npresent at two or three years of age, and may be found even in old\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE UROGENITAL SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis system (Apparatus urogenitalis) includes two groups of organs, the\r\nurinary and the genital. The =urinary organs= elaborate and remove the\r\nchief excretory fluid, the urine. The =genital organs= serve for the\r\nformation, development, and expulsion of the products of the\r\nreproductive glands. In the higher vertebrates the two apparatus are\r\nindependent except at the terminal part, which constitutes a urogenital\r\ntract, and includes the vulva in the female and the greater part of the\r\nurethra in the male.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE URINARY ORGANS\r\n\r\nThe =urinary organs= (Organa uropoiëtica) are the kidneys, ureters,\r\nbladder, and urethra. The =kidneys= are the glands which secrete the\r\nurine; they are red-brown in color, and are situated against the dorsal\r\nwall of the abdomen, being in most animals almost symmetrically placed\r\non either side of the spine. The =ureters= are tubes which convey the\r\nurine to the =bladder=. The latter is an ovoid or pyriform sac, situated\r\non the pelvic floor when empty or nearly so; it is a reservoir for the\r\nurine. The urine accumulates in the bladder until that organ is full,\r\nand is then expelled through the =urethra=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 374.—GENERAL DORSAL VIEW OF URINARY ORGANS OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Right kidney; _1′_, left kidney; _2_, _2′_, adrenal bodies; _3_,\r\n    _3′_, ureters; _4_, urinary bladder; _4′_, anterior end of bladder\r\n    with cicatricial remnant of urachus; _4″_, urethra; _5_, aorta; _6_,\r\n    _6_, renal arteries; _7_, _7_, external iliac arteries; _8_, _8_,\r\n    internal iliac arteries; _9_, _9_, umbilical arteries. (After\r\n    Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE URINARY ORGANS OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\nTHE KIDNEYS\r\n\r\nEach kidney (Ren) presents two surfaces, two borders, and two\r\nextremities or poles, but they differ so much in form and position as to\r\nrequire a separate description of each in these respects.[135]\r\n\r\nThe =right kidney= (Ren dexter) in outline resembles the heart on a\r\nplaying card, or an equilateral triangle with the angles rounded off. It\r\nlies ventral to the upper parts of the last two or three ribs and the\r\ntip of the first lumbar transverse process. The =dorsal= (or superior)\r\n=surface= (Facies dorsalis) is strongly convex; it is related chiefly to\r\nthe diaphragm, but also to a small extent posteriorly to the psoas\r\nmuscles. In well hardened specimens, especially those from thin\r\nsubjects, impressions of the last two ribs and the tip of the first\r\nlumbar transverse process are usually visible. The =ventral= (or\r\ninferior) =surface= (Facies ventralis) is in general slightly concave,\r\nand is related to the liver, pancreas, cæcum, and right adrenal; it\r\neither has no peritoneal covering, or only a narrow area externally is\r\nso covered. The =internal border= (Margo medialis) is convex and\r\nrounded; it is related to the right adrenal and the posterior vena cava.\r\nIt presents about its middle a deep notch, the =hilus= (Hilus renalis);\r\nthis is bounded by rounded margins, and leads into a space termed the\r\n=renal sinus= (Sinus renalis). The vessels and nerves reach the kidney\r\nat the hilus, and the sinus contains the pelvis or dilated origin of the\r\nureter. The =external border= (Margo lateralis) is rounded, and is\r\nthinner than the internal one. It consists of two parts, anterior and\r\nposterior, which meet at an external angle; the anterior part fits into\r\nthe renal impression of the liver. The duodenum curves around the\r\nexternal border. The =anterior extremity= (Extremitas cranialis), thick\r\nand rounded, lies in the renal impression of the liver. The =posterior\r\nextremity= (Extremitas caudalis) is thinner and narrower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 375.—DIAGRAM OF POSITION AND DORSAL RELATIONS OF KIDNEYS OF\r\n    HORSE.\r\n\r\n  Areas of direct relations are inclosed by continuous lines; parts of\r\n    skeleton which overlie the kidneys but are not in contact with them\r\n    are indicated by dotted lines. _L.I_-_III_, lumbar transverse\r\n    processes.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 376.—KIDNEYS AND ADRENALS OF HORSE, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  Hardened _in situ_. Impression of seventeenth rib on right kidney is\r\n    indicated by small cross.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 377.—KIDNEYS AND ADRENALS OF HORSE, VENTRAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  Hardened _in situ_. Left renal vein (not marked) is seen curving round\r\n    posterior end of left adrenal.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =left kidney= (Ren sinister) is bean-shaped. It is considerably\r\nlonger and narrower than the right one, and is situated nearer the\r\nmedian plane and further back, so that the hilus of the left kidney is\r\nabout opposite to the posterior extremity of the right one. It lies\r\nusually under the upper part of the last rib and the first two or three\r\nlumbar transverse processes. The =dorsal surface= is convex, and is\r\nrelated to the left crus of the diaphragm, the psoas muscles, and the\r\nbase of the spleen. The =ventral surface= is convex and irregular; the\r\ngreater part of it is covered by the peritoneum. It is in relation with\r\nthe origin of the small colon, the terminal part of the duodenum, the\r\nleft adrenal, and the left extremity of the pancreas. The =internal\r\nborder= is longer, straighter, and thicker than that of the rightkidney.\r\nIt is related to the posterior aorta, the adrenal, and the ureter. The\r\n=external border= is related chiefly to the base of the spleen. The\r\n=anterior extremity= extends almost to the saccus cæcus of the stomach;\r\nit is related to the left end of the pancreas, and the splenic vessels.\r\nThe =posterior extremity= is usually larger than the anterior one.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The form of the left kidney is variable. In some cases its outline is\r\n  similar to that of the right kidney, but its ventral surface is convex\r\n  and is often marked by several furrows which diverge from the hilus.\r\n  In well hardened specimens the three areas of the dorsal surface are\r\n  often distinct. The psoas area is flat, parallel with the inner\r\n  border, and widens behind. The diaphragmatic area is small and convex;\r\n  it is crescentic and is confined to the anterior pole. The splenic\r\n  area, convex and external, is often so extensive and distinct as\r\n  really to constitute a third surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fixation.=—The kidneys are held in position chiefly by the pressure of\r\nadjacent organs and by the renal fascia. The latter is a special\r\ndevelopment of the subperitoneal tissue, which splits into two layers to\r\ninclose the kidney, together with the perirenal fat or capsula adiposa.\r\nOn account of its relations with the liver, pancreas, and the base of\r\nthe cæcum, the right kidney is much more strongly attached than the left\r\none. It is, therefore, not surprising that the latter varies somewhat in\r\nposition; its posterior pole may be found ventral to the third or fourth\r\nlumbar transverse process. The position of the right kidney seems to be\r\nvery constant, excluding its movements during respiration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 378.—FRONTAL (HORIZONTAL) SECTION OF KIDNEY OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The renal vein is removed. A large accessory renal artery entered the\r\n    posterior pole. Sections of arteries in limiting layer between\r\n    cortical and medullary substance are white in figure.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Weight and Size.=—The right kidney is usually one or two ounces heavier\r\nthan the left. The average weight of the right kidney is about 23 to 24\r\nounces (ca. 700 gm.); that of the left, about 22 to 23 ounces (ca. 670\r\ngm.). The relation of the weight of both kidneys to the body-weight is\r\nabout 1 ∶ 300–350.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chauveau gives as an average 750 grams for the right kidney, and 710\r\n  grams for the left. Ellenberger and Baum (24 cases) give the right\r\n  kidney as varying between 430 and 840 grams; and the left between 425\r\n  and 780; this is an average of 635 grams (about 22½ ounces) for the\r\n  right kidney, and 602.5 grams (about 21½ ounces) for the left. They\r\n  give the relation of the weight of both kidneys to the body-weight as\r\n  1 ∶ 255–344. In a Percheron mare weighing about 2000 pounds the right\r\n  kidney weighed 4 pounds 3 ounces, and the left one 4 pounds. In a\r\n  horse of medium size the right kidney is about six inches (ca. 15 cm.)\r\n  in length, about the same in width, and about two inches (ca. 5 cm.)\r\n  thick. The left kidney is about seven inches (ca. 18 cm.) long, four\r\n  to five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) wide, and two to two and a half\r\n  inches (ca. 5 to 6 cm.) thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The surface of the kidney is covered by a thin but strong\r\n=fibrous capsule= (Tunica fibrosa), which is in general easily stripped\r\noff the healthy kidney. It is continued along the hilus and lines the\r\nrenal sinus. Sections through the kidney show it to consist of an\r\nexternal cortical substance and an internal medullary substance.[136]\r\nThe =cortical substance= (Substantia corticalis) is red brown in color\r\nand has a granular appearance. It is dotted over with minute dark\r\npoints; these are the =renal= (or Malpighian) =corpuscles= (Corpuscula\r\nrenis), each consisting of the dilated origin of a uriniferous tubule\r\n(Capsula glomeruli), with an invaginated tuft of capillaries\r\n(Glomerulus) inclosed by it. The =medullary substance= (Substantia\r\nmedullaris) is more resistant and presents a distinct radial striation.\r\nIts central part is pale, but its periphery, the =intermediate zone=, is\r\nof a deep red color; in the latter are seen, at fairly regular\r\nintervals, sections of the relatively large arciform vessels, which are\r\ntaken to represent the demarcation between the primitive lobes.[137]\r\nBetween the vessels the medulla is prolonged somewhat toward the\r\nperiphery, forming the bases of the =renal= (or Malpighian) =pyramids=.\r\nThese are not very pronounced in the kidney of the horse, especially as\r\nthe gland is not papillated. Between the bases of the pyramids processes\r\nof the cortex dip in toward the sinus, forming the =renal columns=.[138]\r\nThe inner central part of the medulla forms a concave ridge or crest\r\nwhich projects into the pelvis of the kidney; the crest is marked by\r\nnumerous small openings at which the renal tubules terminate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 379.—TRANSVERSE SECTION OF RIGHT KIDNEY OF HORSE THROUGH THE\r\n    HILUS.\r\n\r\n  Posterior portion of organ hardened _in situ_. Note curvature of\r\n    dorsal surface.\r\n]\r\n\r\nExamination with a pocket lens shows that the cortex is imperfectly\r\ndivided into =lobules= (Lobuli corticales). Each lobule consists of an\r\naxial =radiate part= (Pars radiata), surrounded by a =convoluted part=\r\n(Pars convoluta). The former (formerly termed pyramids of Ferrein)\r\nappear as ray-like prolongations from the bases of the pyramids (hence\r\nalso termed medullary rays), and consist largely of narrow, straight or\r\nslightly flexuous, tubules (limbs of the loops of Henle). The convoluted\r\npart (formerly termed the labyrinth) is granular in appearance, and\r\nconsists largely of the renal corpuscles and convoluted tubules.\r\n\r\nThe =pelvis= of the kidney (Pelvis renalis) is the dilated origin of the\r\nexcretory duct. It lies in the sinus of the kidney, and it is\r\nfunnel-shaped, but flattened dorso-ventrally. The =renal crest=[139]\r\n(Papilla communis) projects into the outer part of the pelvis in the\r\nform of a horizontal ridge with a concave free edge. The tubules of the\r\nmiddle part of the medullary substance open on this crest into the\r\npelvis. The tubules from each end of the kidney do not open into the\r\npelvis proper (Recessus medius), but into two long, narrow diverticula\r\n(Recessus terminales), which proceed from it toward the poles of the\r\nkidney. The wall of the pelvis consists of three layers. The external\r\n=fibrous coat= or adventitia is continuous with the supporting tissue of\r\nthe kidney. The =muscular coat= consists of longitudinal and circular\r\nfibers. The =mucous coat= does not cover the renal crest, nor is it\r\ncontinued into the diverticula of the pelvis. It has a yellowish tinge,\r\nand presents numerous folds. It contains glands (Glandulæ pelvis\r\nrenalis) which secrete the thick mucus always found in the pelvis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 380.—DIAGRAMMATIC SCHEME OF URINIFEROUS TUBULES AND BLOOD-VESSELS\r\n    OF KIDNEY.\r\n\r\n  Drawn in part from the descriptions of Golubew (Böhm, Davidoff, and\r\n    Huber).\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Renal Tubules=—The parenchyma or proper substance of the kidney is\r\n  composed of the small =renal= or =uriniferous tubules= (Tubuli\r\n  renales), which are very close together and have a complicated course.\r\n  Each tubule begins in a thin-walled, spherical dilatation or\r\n  =capsule=, which is invaginated to receive a tuft of looped\r\n  capillaries termed a =glomerulus=; these two structures constitute a\r\n  =renal= (or Malpighian) =corpuscle=; the corpuscles are visible as\r\n  minute red or dark spots in the convoluted part of the cortex.\r\n  Succeeding this is a short narrow neck, beyond which the tubule\r\n  becomes wide and convoluted, forming the proximal convoluted tubule,\r\n  and enters the radiate portion of the cortex. It then gradually\r\n  narrows and enters the intermediate zone; becoming very narrow and\r\n  nearly straight, it descends for a variable distance into the\r\n  medullary substance, turns sharply upon itself, and returns to the\r\n  cortex, forming thus the loop of Henle, with its descending and\r\n  ascending limbs. In the convoluted part of the cortex, it widens and\r\n  becomes tortuous, constituting the distal convoluted tubule. The\r\n  tubule then narrows, enters a medullary ray, and opens with other\r\n  tubules into a straight collecting tubule; this passes axially through\r\n  a pyramid, and unites with other collecting tubules to form the\r\n  relatively large papillary ducts, which open into the renal pelvis.\r\n\r\n  =Stroma.=—The interstitial tissue forms a reticulum throughout which\r\n  supports the tubules and blood-vessels. It is very scanty in the\r\n  cortex, much more abundant in the medulla, in which it increases in\r\n  amount toward the pelvis.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—The kidneys receive a large amount of blood through the\r\n=renal arteries=. Branches of these enter at the hilus and on the\r\nventral surface of the gland, and reach the intermediate zone, where\r\nthey form anastomotic arches (Arteriæ arciformes). From these arciform\r\narteries branches pass into the cortex and medulla. The cortical\r\nbranches (Arteriæ interlobulares) have in general a radial course\r\nbetween the cortical lobules, and give off short lateral branches, each\r\nof which ends as the =afferent vessel= (Vas afferens) of a renal\r\ncorpuscle. The blood is carried from the glomerulus by a smaller\r\n=efferent vessel=, which breaks up immediately into capillaries which\r\nform networks around the tubules. The medullary branches descend in the\r\npyramids, forming in them bundles of straight twigs (Arteriolæ rectæ).\r\n\r\nThe =veins= correspond in general to the arteries. In the superficial\r\npart of the cortex the veins form star-like figures (Venæ stellatæ) by\r\nthe convergence of several small radicles to a common trunk.\r\n\r\n=Lymph Vessels.=—These may be divided into two sets, capsular or\r\nsuperficial, and parenchymatous or deep.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—The nerves are derived from the renal plexus of the\r\nsympathetic, and form a plexus around the vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE URETERS\r\n\r\nThe =ureters= are the narrow part of the excretory ducts of the kidneys.\r\nEach begins at the renal pelvis and terminates at the bladder. It is\r\nabout ⅓ to ¼ inch (ca. 6 to 8 mm.) in diameter, and its average length\r\nis about 28 inches (ca. 70 cm.). The =abdominal part= (Pars abdominalis)\r\nof each ureter emerges ventrally from the hilus of the kidney, and\r\ncurves backward and inward toward the lateral face of the posterior vena\r\ncava (right side) or the posterior aorta (left side). They then pass\r\nalmost straight backward in the subperitoneal tissue on the surface of\r\nthe psoas minor, cross the external iliac vessels, and enter the pelvic\r\ncavity. The =pelvic part= (Pars pelvina) passes backward and a little\r\ndownward on the lateral wall of the pelvic cavity, turns inward, and\r\npierces the dorsal wall of the bladder near the neck.\r\n\r\nIn the male the pelvic part enters the urogenital fold and crosses the\r\nvas deferens. In the female the ureter is situated in the greater part\r\nof its course in the dorsal part of the broad ligament of the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the ureter is composed of three coats. The outer =fibrous\r\ncoat= (Tunica adventitia) is composed of loose fibrous tissue. The\r\n=muscular coat= (Tunica muscularis) consists of inner and outer layers\r\nof longitudinal fibers, with a stratum of circular fibers between them.\r\nThe =mucous membrane= (Tunica mucosa) is covered with transitional\r\nepithelium; glands (Glandulæ mucosæ ureteris) resembling those of the\r\nrenal pelvis occur in the first three or four inches of the ureter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE URINARY BLADDER\r\n\r\nThe =urinary bladder= (Vesica urinaria) (Figs. 270, 271, 272) differs in\r\nform, size, and position according to the amount of its contents. When\r\nempty and contracted, it is a dense, pyriform mass, about the size of a\r\nfist, lies on the ventral wall of the pelvic cavity, and does not reach\r\nto the inlet. When moderately filled, it is ovoid in form, and extends a\r\nvariable distance along the ventral abdominal wall. Its physiological\r\ncapacity varies greatly, but may be estimated approximately at about\r\nthree or four quarts.\r\n\r\nThe anterior rounded blind end is termed the =vertex=;[140] on its\r\nmiddle is a mass of cicatricial tissue (Centrum verticis), a vestige of\r\nthe urachus, which in the fœtus forms a tubular connection between the\r\nbladder and the allantois. The =body= or middle part (Corpus vesicæ) is\r\nrounded, and is somewhat flattened dorso-ventrally, except when\r\ndistended. It presents two surfaces, dorsal and ventral, the former\r\nbeing the more strongly convex, especially in its posterior part in\r\nfront of the entrance of the ureters.[141] The posterior narrow\r\nextremity, the =neck= (Collum vesicæ), joins the urethra.\r\n\r\nThe =relations= of the bladder vary according to the degree of fullness\r\nof the organ, and also differ in important respects in the two sexes.\r\nThe ventral surface lies on the ventral wall of the pelvis, and extends\r\nforward on the abdominal wall as the bladder fills. The dorsal surface\r\nin the male is related to the rectum, the urogenital fold, the terminal\r\nparts of the vasa deferentia, the vesiculæ seminales, and the prostate;\r\nin the female it is in contact, instead, with the body of the uterus and\r\nthe vagina. The vertex of the full bladder is related to coils of the\r\nsmall intestine and small colon, and to the pelvic flexure of the large\r\ncolon.\r\n\r\n=Fixation.=—Displacement of the bladder is limited chiefly by three\r\nperitoneal folds, termed the middle and lateral ligaments (Figs. 257,\r\n272). The =middle ligament= (Plica umbilicalis media) is a median\r\ntriangular fold, formed by the reflection of the peritoneum from the\r\nventral surface of the bladder on to the ventral wall of the pelvis and\r\nabdomen. In the new-born animal it is extensive and reaches to the\r\numbilicus; in the adult it is usually much reduced in length relatively.\r\nIt contains elastic and muscular fibers in its posterior part. The\r\n=lateral ligaments= (Plicæ umbilicales laterales) stretch from the\r\nlateral aspects of the bladder to the lateral pelvic walls. Each\r\ncontains in its free edge a round, firm band, the =round= or =umbilical\r\nligament= (Lig. umbilicale s. teres); this is the remnant of the large\r\nfœtal umbilical artery, the lumen of which in the adult is very small.\r\nThe retroperitoneal part of the bladder is attached to the surrounding\r\nparts by loose connective tissue, in which there is a quantity of fat.\r\nIt is evident that the posterior part of the bladder has a definite\r\nfixed position, while its anterior part is movable.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The wall of the bladder consists of a partial peritoneal\r\ninvestment, the muscular coat, and the mucous lining.\r\n\r\nThe =serous coat= (Tunica serosa) covers the greater part of the dorsal\r\nsurface, from which it is reflected in the male to form the urogenital\r\nfold; in the female it passes on to the vagina, forming the\r\nvesico-genital pouch. Ventrally the peritoneum covers only the anterior\r\nhalf or less of the bladder, and is reflected posteriorly on to the\r\npelvic floor.\r\n\r\nThe =muscular coat= (Tunica muscularis) is relatively thin when the\r\nbladder is full. It is unstriped, pale, and not clearly divided into\r\nlayers, but has rather a plexiform arrangement. Longitudinal fibers\r\noccur on the dorsal and ventral surfaces, but laterally they become\r\noblique and decussate with each other. A distinctly circular arrangement\r\nis found at the neck, where the fibers form a =sphincter= (Annulus\r\nurethralis).\r\n\r\nThe =mucous coat= (Tunica mucosa) is pale and thin. It is in general\r\nattached by a highly elastic submucosa to the muscular coat, and forms\r\nnumerous folds when the organ is empty and contracted. It is modified\r\ndorsally in the vicinity of the neck over a triangular area, termed the\r\n=trigonum vesicæ=; the angles of this space lie at the orifices of the\r\ntwo ureters and the urethra, which are close together. Here the mucous\r\nmembrane is closely attached and does not form folds. From each\r\n=ureteral orifice= (Orificium ureteris) a fold of mucous membrane (Plica\r\nureterica) passes backward and inward, uniting with its fellow to form a\r\nmedian crest (Crista urethralis) in the first part of the urethra. The\r\nureteral orifices are a little more than one inch (ca. 3 cm.) apart. The\r\nterminal part of the ureter, after piercing the muscular coat of the\r\nbladder, passes for a distance of about an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.) between\r\nthe muscular and mucous coats before piercing the latter; this\r\narrangement constitutes a valve which prevents absolutely the return of\r\nthe urine from the bladder into the ureter. The =internal urethral\r\norifice= (Orificium urethæ internum) lies at the apex of the trigonum,\r\nand is about an inch and a half (ca. 4 cm.) behind the ureteral\r\norifices. The mucous membrane is covered with transitional epithelium\r\nlike that of the ureter and renal pelvis. It contains lymph nodules.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—This is derived chiefly from the vesico-prostatic branch\r\nof the =internal pudic artery=. It is also supplied by small twigs from\r\nthe =obturator= and =umbilical arteries=. The =veins= terminate chiefly\r\nin the =internal pudic veins=. They form plexuses posteriorly.\r\n\r\n=Lymph Vessels.=—These form plexuses on both surfaces of the muscular\r\ncoat. They go to the internal iliac and lumbar glands.\r\n\r\n=Nerves.=—The nerves are derived from the =pelvic plexus= (sympathetic\r\nand ventral branches of third and fourth sacral nerves). They form a\r\nplexus in the submucosa which presents microscopic ganglia.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the fœtus and new-born animal the bladder is situated chiefly in\r\n  the abdomen. It is long, narrow, and fusiform. Its abdominal end lies\r\n  at the umbilicus, through which it is continued by the urachus to the\r\n  extra-embryonic part of the allantois. As the pelvis increases in size\r\n  and the large intestine grows, the bladder retracts into the pelvis\r\n  and changes its form.\r\n\r\n  The urethra will be described with the genital organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ADRENAL BODIES\r\n\r\nThe =adrenal bodies= or =suprarenal glands= (Glandulæ suprarenales)[142]\r\nare two small, flattened organs, which lie in contact with the anterior\r\npart of the inner border of the kidneys (Figs. 376, 377). They are\r\nductless.\r\n\r\nIn the horse they are red-brown in color, about three and a half to four\r\ninches (ca. 9 to 10 cm.) long, one to one and a half inches (ca. 3 to 4\r\ncm.) wide, and about half an inch or more (ca. 1 to 5 cm.) in thickness.\r\nThe weight varies from one to two ounces (ca. 28 to 56 gm.).\r\n\r\nThe =right adrenal= is related internally to the posterior vena cava, to\r\nwhich it is adherent. Its anterior part curves dorsally around the inner\r\nborder of the right kidney. Its posterior part is flattened and is\r\nrelated ventrally to the pancreas and cæcum, dorsally, to the right\r\nrenal vessels. The anterior extremity is concealed in the renal\r\nimpression of the liver; the posterior is related to the ureter.\r\n\r\nThe =left adrenal= is a little shorter than the right one, and its\r\nextremities are rounded; it is usually curved, so that its internal\r\nborder partly embraces the anterior mesenteric artery. Its dorsal\r\nsurface is related to the kidney, the renal artery, the aorta, and the\r\nleft cœliaco-mesenteric ganglion. The ventral surface is in relation\r\nwith the left extremity of the pancreas and the root of the great\r\nmesentery. The posterior extremity often curves inward behind the\r\nanterior mesenteric artery; it is related behind to the left renal vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When hardened _in situ_ the adrenals present several features not\r\n  evident in the soft organs. The anterior part of the right adrenal is\r\n  twisted upward and outward over the inner margin of the kidney, so\r\n  that this part is prismatic and has three surfaces; of these, the\r\n  concave outer one is applied to the kidney, the dorsal one is related\r\n  to the right crus of the diaphragm and the liver, and the inner one is\r\n  in contact with the posterior vena cava. The anterior mesenteric\r\n  artery is nearly always more or less enlarged as a result of verminous\r\n  arteritis, and the form and degree of curvature of the left adrenal\r\n  seem to vary in conformity with the condition of the artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The =fibrous capsule= adheres intimately to the surface of\r\nthe organ. It contains elastic fibers, and in its deep part unstriped\r\nmuscle-fibers. From it trabeculæ pass radially into the substance,\r\nblending with the fine supporting reticulum. The =parenchyma= consists\r\nof a cortical and a medullary portion. The =cortical substance=\r\n(Substantia corticalis) is red-brown in color, and is clearly\r\ndistinguishable from the yellow =medullary substance= (Substantia\r\nmedullaris). A large =central vein= (Vena centralis) is visible on\r\ncross-sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The cells of the cortex are arranged in chains of one or two rows. In\r\n  the peripheral portion the cells are of high cylindrical shape, and\r\n  the chains form connecting loops; Günther has proposed the name zona\r\n  arcuata for this part, instead of the usual term zona glomerularis.\r\n  More deeply the chains are distinctly palisade-like, and this region\r\n  is called the zona fasciculata. Next to the medulla is the zona\r\n  reticularis, in which the chains form a network. The cells in these\r\n  two zones are polygonal and contain a brown pigment.\r\n\r\n  The cells of the medulla are arranged in irregular groups or form\r\n  sheaths around the veins. They react to chromic salts by assuming a\r\n  yellow or yellow-brown color, and are termed chromaffin cells; they\r\n  share this peculiarity with certain cells of the sympathetic ganglia\r\n  and paraganglia, with which they are probably related genetically. The\r\n  alkaloid adrenalin appears to be formed in the medullary cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The adrenals receive a relatively large\r\nblood-supply through the =adrenal arteries= (Aa. suprarenales), which\r\narise from the renal arteries or from the aorta directly. The =veins=\r\nterminate in the posterior vena cava and the left renal vein. The =lymph\r\nvessels= go to the renal lymph glands. The numerous =nerves= are derived\r\nfrom the sympathetic system through the solar and renal plexuses. The\r\nfibers form a rich interlacement, especially in the medullary substance.\r\nGanglion cells are found chiefly in the medulla, but also occur in the\r\ndeeper part of the cortex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 381.—ADRENAL BODY OF HORSE; HORIZONTAL SECTION, REDUCED.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Capsule; _2_, _2′_, cortical substance; _3_, medullary substance;\r\n    _4_, blood-vessel in section. (From Leisering’s Atlas, reduced.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        URINARY ORGANS OF THE OX\r\n\r\nThe =kidneys= are superficially divided into polygonal lobes by fissures\r\nof variable depth. The lobes vary in size, and are commonly about twenty\r\nto twenty-five in number. The fissures are filled with fat.\r\n\r\nThe =right kidney= has an elongated elliptical outline, and is flattened\r\ndorso-ventrally. It lies ventral to the last rib and the first two or\r\nthree lumbar transverse processes. The dorsal surface is rounded, and is\r\nin contact chiefly with the sublumbar muscles. The ventral surface is\r\nless convex, and is related to the liver, pancreas, duodenum, and\r\nterminal part of the colon. The hilus is situated on the anterior part\r\nof this surface near the inner border. The internal border is nearly\r\nstraight, and lies parallel with the posterior vena cava. The external\r\nborder is convex. The anterior extremity occupies the renal impression\r\nof the liver, and is capped by the adrenal body.\r\n\r\nThe =left kidney= occupies a remarkable position, and when hardened _in\r\nsitu_, differs strongly in form from the right one. When the rumen is\r\nfull, it pushes the kidney backward and across the median plane, so that\r\nit is situated on the right side, behind and at a lower level than the\r\nright kidney. It then lies usually under the third, fourth, and fifth\r\nlumbar vertebræ. When the rumen is not full, the left kidney may lie\r\npartly to the left of the median plane. It has three surfaces. The\r\ndorsal surface is convex, and presents on its antero-external part the\r\nhilus, which opens outward. The ventral surface is related to the\r\nintestine. The third face is often more or less flattened by contact\r\nwith the rumen, and may be termed the ruminal surface. The anterior\r\nextremity is small, the posterior large and rounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 382.—RIGHT KIDNEY OF OX, VENTRAL FACE.\r\n\r\n  Organ hardened _in situ_. Fat has been removed from fissures between\r\n    lobes.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The preceding statements refer to the adult subject, and are based on\r\n  investigations made on living subjects, and studies of frozen sections\r\n  and material hardened _in situ_. In the young calf the kidneys are\r\n  almost symmetrically placed, but as the rumen grows it pushes the left\r\n  kidney to the right and backward _pari passu_. It also usually causes\r\n  a rotation of the kidney, so that the primary dorsal surface comes to\r\n  lie almost in a sagittal plane. Further, the gland is bent so that the\r\n  hilus is largely closed up and faces outward (to the right). In very\r\n  fat subjects the three-sided appearance of the kidney may be absent,\r\n  and about one-third or more may remain to the left of the median\r\n  plane, even where the rumen is pretty well filled.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 383.—FRONTAL SECTION OF KIDNEY OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _L_, Lobes of cortex; _P_, papillæ; _C_, calyx major; _c′_, calyces\r\n    minores.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe kidneys are embedded in a large amount of perirenal fat. The weight\r\nof a kidney is about 20 to 25 ounces (ca. 570 to 700 gm.), the left one\r\nbeing usually an ounce or more the heavier. The two form about ¼ per\r\ncent. of the body-weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The right kidney measures about 8 to 10 inches (ca. 20 to 25 cm.) in\r\n  length, 4 to 5 inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) in width, and 2½ to 3 inches\r\n  (ca. 7 cm.) in thickness. The left kidney is one or two inches (ca. 2\r\n  to 5 cm.) shorter, but its posterior part is much thicker than the\r\n  right one.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The hilus is equivalent to the hilus and sinus of the\r\nkidney of the horse; in the right kidney it is an extensive elliptical\r\ncavity, in the left, a deep fissure. The pelvis is absent. The ureter\r\nbegins at the junction of two wide, thin-walled tubes, the =calyces\r\nmajores=; the anterior calyx is usually the larger. Each calyx major\r\ngives off a number of branches, and these divide into several\r\nfunnel-shaped =calyces minores=, each of which embraces a renal papilla.\r\nThe space not occupied by the calyces and vessels is filled with fat.\r\n\r\nOn section through the kidney the =renal pyramids= are easily made out.\r\nThe blunt apex of each pyramid, the =papilla renalis=, projects into a\r\ncalyx minor. On each papilla are small orifices (Foramina papillaria) by\r\nwhich the terminal renal tubules (Ductus papillares) open into the\r\ncalyx. The renal columns are much more distinct than in the horse.\r\n\r\nAt the hilus the renal artery is dorsal, the vein in the middle, and the\r\nureter ventral; a quantity of fat surrounds these structures in the\r\nhilus.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys of the =sheep= are bean-shaped and smooth, without any\r\nsuperficial lobation. The soft organ is regularly elliptical in form,\r\nwith convex dorsal and ventral surfaces and rounded extremities; its\r\nlength is about 2½ to 3 inches (ca. 5 to 8 cm.), its width about 1½ to 2\r\ninches (ca. 4 to 5 cm.), and its thickness a little more than 1 inch\r\n(ca. 3 cm.). In position they resemble those of the ox, except that the\r\nright one is usually a little further back, and lies under the first\r\nthree lumbar transverse processes. The average weight of each is about\r\nfour ounces. The hilus is in the middle of the inner border. There is a\r\nrenal crest or common papilla formed by the fusion of twelve to sixteen\r\npyramids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 384.—KIDNEY OF SHEEP, VENTRAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _V.V._, Branches of renal vein.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 385.—KIDNEY OF SHEEP, HORIZONTAL SECTION.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cortical substance; _2_, medullary substance; _3_, renal crest;\r\n    _4_, renal pelvis; _5_, ureter. (From Leisering’s Atlas, reduced.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the rumen is full, the left kidney (which is attached by a short\r\n  mesentery) usually lies entirely to the right of the median plane,\r\n  under the third, fourth, and fifth lumbar transverse processes. The\r\n  primitive dorsal surface has become ventro-medial, and is somewhat\r\n  flattened by contact with the rumen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =ureters= are, in general, like those of the horse, except in regard\r\nto the first part of the left one, which has a peculiar course, in\r\nconformity with the remarkable position of the kidney. It begins at the\r\nventral part of the hilus (which faces toward the right), curves upward\r\nand inward over the outer aspect of the kidney to its dorsal surface,\r\ncrosses the median plane, and runs backward on the left side.\r\n\r\nThe =bladder= is longer and narrower than that of the horse, and extends\r\nfurther forward on the abdominal floor. The peritoneal coat extends\r\nbackward further than in the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ADRENAL BODIES\r\n\r\nThe =right adrenal= lies against the inner part of the anterior pole of\r\nthe right kidney. When hardened _in situ_ it is pyramidal in form. Its\r\ninner surface is flattened and is in contact with the right crus of the\r\ndiaphragm. The outer surface is convex and lies in the renal impression\r\nof the liver. The ventral surface is grooved for the posterior vena\r\ncava; on this surface a relatively large vein emerges near the apex. The\r\nbase is concave and rests obliquely against the anterior pole of the\r\nkidney. The apex fits into the angle between the posterior vena cava and\r\nthe dorsal border of the liver.\r\n\r\nThe =left adrenal= lies on the inner face of the posterior vena cava\r\njust behind the anterior mesenteric artery, and is therefore practically\r\nmedian in position. It is flattened, and irregularly triangular or\r\nheart-shaped in outline. Its left face is related to the dorsal sac of\r\nthe rumen. Its right face is related to the vena cava, and presents a\r\nlarge emergent vein. The posterior border or base is deeply notched.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 386.—LEFT ADRENAL OF OX, VENTRAL VIEW: HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 387.—RIGHT ADRENAL OF OX, VENTRAL VIEW: HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is interesting to note that the left adrenal does not migrate with\r\n  the kidney, but retains its primitive position; it lies usually about\r\n  two inches (ca. 5 cm.) in front of a transverse plane through the\r\n  anterior pole of the left kidney.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adrenals of the =sheep= are both bean-shaped. The right one lies\r\nalong the anterior part of the inner border of the kidney, at the angle\r\nof the junction of the right renal vein and the posterior vena cava. It\r\nis a little over an inch (ca. 3 cm.) long, and about an inch (ca. 12 to\r\n15 mm.) wide. The left adrenal is longer, flatter, and somewhat bent. It\r\nlies across the left renal vein, to which it is attached, but is not in\r\ncontact with the kidney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 388.—KIDNEYS OF PIG _in situ_, VENTRAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _C.a._, Hepatic artery; _M.a._, gastro-splenic artery.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 389.—FRONTAL SECTION OF KIDNEY OF PIG.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       URINARY ORGANS OF THE PIG\r\n\r\nThe =kidneys= are smooth and bean-shaped; they are more flattened\r\ndorso-ventrally, more elongated, and smaller at the extremities than\r\nthose of the dog. The length is about twice the width. They are usually\r\nalmost symmetrically placed on either side of the first four lumbar\r\nvertebræ. (Variations in position are not rare, and involve the left\r\nkidney oftener than the right. The former has been found near the pelvic\r\ninlet.) The external border lies against the flank parallel with the\r\nedge of the longissimus muscle. The posterior extremity usually lies\r\nabout midway between the last rib and the external angle of the ilium.\r\nThe anterior extremity of the right kidney usually extends as far\r\nforward as the last rib, but has no contact with the liver.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the kidney of a medium-sized pig is about seven to nine\r\nounces (200 to 250 grams). The ratio of their combined weight to that of\r\nthe body is about 1 ∶ 150–200.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The hilus is about in the middle of the inner border. The\r\npelvis is funnel-shaped, and divides into two calyces majores, which\r\npass in a curve forward and backward respectively, and give off some\r\neight to twelve short calyces minores; each of the latter contains a\r\npapilla. Some papillæ are narrow and conical, and correspond to a single\r\npyramid; others are wide and flattened, and result from the fusion of\r\ntwo or more pyramids; some project directly through the wall of the\r\npelvis without the formation of a calyx. The renal pyramids are\r\ndistinct, but it is apparent that some are compound, _i. e._, formed by\r\nfusion of primitively separate pyramids. The renal artery enters the\r\nventral part of the hilus, and the ureter leaves it dorsally.\r\n\r\nThe only special feature in regard to the =ureter= is that it is at\r\nfirst relatively wide and gradually diminishes in caliber.\r\n\r\nThe =bladder= is relatively very large; when full, it lies chiefly in\r\nthe abdominal cavity. It is almost completely covered with peritoneum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       URINARY ORGANS OF THE DOG\r\n\r\nThe =kidneys= are relatively large, forming about ¹⁄₁₅₀ to ¹⁄₂₀₀ of the\r\nbody-weight; the weight of the kidney of a medium-sized dog is about two\r\nounces (ca. 50 to 60 grams). They are both bean-shaped, thick\r\ndorso-ventrally, with a rounded ventral surface and a less convex dorsal\r\nsurface; the surfaces are smooth.\r\n\r\nThe =right kidney= (Fig. 343) is not subject to much variation in\r\nposition; it is situated usually under the last rib and the first three\r\nlumbar transverse processes. Its anterior part lies in the deep renal\r\nimpression of the liver; its posterior part is related to the sublumbar\r\nmuscles dorsally, and the pancreas and duodenum ventrally.\r\n\r\nThe =left kidney= (Fig. 342) is subject to some variation in position;\r\nthis is due to the fact that it is loosely attached by the peritoneum,\r\nand is affected by the degree of fullness of the stomach. When the\r\nstomach is nearly empty, the kidney usually lies under the transverse\r\nprocesses of the second, third, and fourth lumbar vertebræ, so that its\r\nanterior pole is opposite to the hilus of the right kidney. As the\r\nstomach fills it pushes the left kidney backward, so that the anterior\r\npole of the latter may be opposite the posterior pole of the right\r\nkidney. The dorsal surface is related to the sublumbar muscles. The\r\nventral surface is in contact with the terminal part of the colon (Colon\r\ndescendens). The external border is related to the spleen and the flank.\r\nThe anterior extremity touches the stomach and the left extremity of the\r\npancreas.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The external border of the left kidney has considerable contact with\r\n  the flank, and hence it may be palpated more or less distinctly in the\r\n  living animal about half-way between the last rib and the crest of the\r\n  ilium.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The hilus is in the middle of the inner border and is,\r\nrelatively wide. Cortex, limiting zone, and medulla are clearly defined.\r\nOn frontal sections it is seen that the medullary substance forms a\r\nhorizontal renal crest like that of the horse, but with the important\r\ndifference that curved ridges proceed dorsally and ventrally from the\r\ncrest somewhat like buttresses. Sections above or below the renal crest\r\noften cut these ridges in such a manner as to give the appearance of\r\nconical papillæ, and thus tend strongly to produce a false impression.\r\nThe pelvis is adapted to this arrangement of the medullary substance. It\r\nincloses a central cavity into which the renal crest projects, and is\r\nprolonged outward between the ridges, forming cavities for the latter,\r\nthus simulating the appearance of calyces which do not exist.\r\n\r\nThe =ureters= present no special features.\r\n\r\nThe =bladder= is abdominal in position, the neck lying at the anterior\r\nborder of the pubic bones. It is relatively large, and when full, the\r\nvertex may reach to the umbilicus. It has a practically complete\r\nperitoneal coat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE ADRENALS\r\n\r\nThe =right adrenal= lies between the anterior part of the inner border\r\nof the kidney and the posterior vena cava. It is somewhat prismatic, and\r\nis pointed at either end.\r\n\r\nThe =left adrenal= lies along the posterior aorta, from the renal vein\r\nforward, but is not in contact with the kidney. It is elongated and\r\nflattened dorso-ventrally. (There is a furrow on the ventral surface for\r\nthe vein which crosses it; the part in front of this furrow is discoid,\r\nand may be taken for the entire organ in a fat subject.)\r\n\r\nThe cortex is pale yellow in color, the medulla dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE MALE GENITAL ORGANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe male =genital organs= (Organa genitalia masculina) are: (1) The two\r\n=testicles=, the essential reproductive glands, with their coverings and\r\nappendages; (2) the =vasa deferentia=, the ducts of the testicles; (3)\r\nthe =vesiculæ seminales=; (4) the =prostate=, a musculo-glandular organ;\r\n(5) the two =bulbo-urethral= (or Cowper’s) =glands=; (6) the male\r\n=urethra=, a canal which transmits the generative and urinary\r\nsecretions; (7) the =penis=, the male copulatory organ. The vesiculæ\r\nseminales, the prostate, and the bulbo-urethral glands discharge their\r\nsecretions into the urethra, where they mix with the seminal fluid\r\nsecreted by the testicles; hence they are often termed the accessory\r\nsexual glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    MALE GENITAL ORGANS OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE TESTICLES\r\n\r\nThe =testicles= (Testes) are situated in the inguinal region, inclosed\r\nin a diverticulum of the abdomen termed the scrotum. Their long axes are\r\nnearly longitudinal. They are ovoid in form, but considerably compressed\r\nfrom side to side. Each presents two surfaces, two borders, and two\r\nextremities. The =internal= and =external surfaces= (Facies medialis,\r\nlateralis) are convex and smooth. The =free= or ventral =border= (Margo\r\nliber) is convex in both directions. The =attached= or dorsal =border=\r\n(Margo epididymidis) is nearly straight, and is the one by which the\r\ngland is suspended in the scrotum by the spermatic cord; the epididymis\r\nis attached to this border and overlies it externally. The =anterior=\r\nand =posterior extremities= (Extremitas capitata, caudalis) are rounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the anterior extremity there is often a sessile or pedunculated sac\r\n  which contains a clear fluid; this is the =appendix testis= or hydatid\r\n  of Morgagni, from which a thread-like process extends backward toward\r\n  the vas deferens. It is regarded as a remnant of the Müllerian duct of\r\n  the embryo.\r\n\r\n\r\nA testicle of average size of an adult stallion is about four or five\r\ninches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) long, two and a half inches (ca. 6 to 7 cm.)\r\nhigh, and one and a half to two inches (ca. 4 to 5 cm.) wide; it weighs\r\nabout ten and one-half ounces (ca. 300 grams). They vary much in size in\r\ndifferent subjects, and are commonly of unequal size, the left one being\r\nmore often the larger.\r\n\r\nThe =epididymis= is adherent to the attached border of the testicle, and\r\noverlaps somewhat the external surface. Its anterior enlarged end is\r\ntermed the =head= or globus major (Caput epididymidis), and its\r\nposterior, slightly enlarged end is the tail or globus minor (Cauda\r\nepididymidis); while the intermediate narrow part is the =body= (Corpus\r\nepididymidis). The head is closely connected with the testicle by the\r\nefferent ducts of the latter, by connective tissue, and by the serous\r\nmembrane. The body is less closely attached by the serous covering,\r\nwhich forms externally a pocket beneath the epididymis termed the\r\n=digital fossa= (Sinus epididymidis). The tail is firmly attached to the\r\nposterior extremity of the testicle by a short ligament (Lig.\r\nepididymidis), formed by a thick fold of the tunica vaginalis, which\r\ncontains smooth muscle-fibers; it is continued by the vas deferens.\r\n\r\n=Structure of the Testicle and Epididymis.= The greater part of the\r\nsurface of the testicle is covered by a serous membrane, the =tunica\r\nvaginalis propria=, which is the visceral layer of the serous envelop of\r\nthe cord and testicle; this is reflected from the attached border of the\r\ngland, leaving an uncovered area at which the vessels and nerves in the\r\nspermatic cord reach the testicle. Beneath this serous covering is the\r\n=tunica albuginea=, a strong capsule composed of dense white inelastic\r\nfibrous tissue and unstriped muscle-fibers. From the deep surface of\r\nthis tunic delicate membranous =septa= (Septula testis) pass into the\r\ngland, dividing it into pyramidal spaces, the bases of which are\r\nperipheral. At the anterior part of the attached border of the testicle\r\nconnective tissue and smooth muscle-fibers pass into the substance of\r\nthe gland, forming the =mediastinum testis=; from this the septa\r\nradiate. The mediastinum contains a network of fine canals, the =rete\r\ntestis=; it is traversed by blood-vessels, which radiate on the septa to\r\nthe deep face of the tunica albuginea, forming a delicate network—the\r\nso-called tunica vasculosa. The spaces imperfectly marked off by the\r\nsepta contain the =parenchyma testis=, which consists of =seminiferous\r\ntubules= (Tubuli seminiferi), supported by loose intertubular connective\r\ntissue. The tubules are collected into small masses or =lobules= (Lobuli\r\ntestis). They are at first very tortuous (Tubuli contorti); toward the\r\napex of the lobule they unite with other tubules, forming larger\r\nstraight tubules (Tubuli recti); these pass into the mediastinum testis,\r\nwhere they form the =rete testis=. From the latter a number (ca. 15 to\r\n20) of larger =efferent tubules= (Vasa efferentia) pierce the albuginea\r\nand enter the head of the epididymis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 390.—INGUINAL REGION OF STALLION, WITH TESTICLES EXPOSED.\r\n\r\n  _a_, _a′_, Testicles; _b_, scrotum, opened and reflected; _c_, tunica\r\n    vaginalis communis, opened and reflected; _d_, ligament of\r\n    epididymis; _e_, tunica vaginalis propria (mesorchium); _f_, vas\r\n    deferens; _g_, _g′_, tail of epididymis; _h_, body of same; _i_,\r\n    head of same; _k_, digital fossa or sinus epididymidis; _l_,\r\n    spermatic vessels showing through tunica vaginalis propria; _m_,\r\n    spermatic artery; _n_, prepuce; _n′_, raphé; _o_, preputial orifice.\r\n    (After Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =epididymis= is covered by the tunica vaginalis propria and a thin\r\nalbuginea. Its head consists of =lobules= (Lobuli epididymidis), each of\r\nwhich consists of a coiled tubule or =conus vasculosus=, which succeeds\r\na vas efferens. By the union of these tubules is formed a single tube,\r\nthe =duct of the epididymis= (Ductus epididymidis), which, by its\r\ncomplex coils, forms the body and tail of the epididymis and terminates\r\nin the vas deferens. The tubules and the coils of the duct of the\r\nepididymis are held together by connective tissue and unstriped\r\nmuscle-fibers. The tubules and duct are lined with ciliated epithelium,\r\nand the duct has a muscular coat which consists of longitudinal and\r\ncircular fibers.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The testicle is richly supplied with blood by the\r\n=spermatic artery=, a branch of the posterior aorta. The artery descends\r\nin the anterior part of the spermatic cord, and is very tortuous near\r\nthe testicle; on reaching the attached border of the gland it passes\r\nbackward in a flexuous manner, giving branches to the testicle and\r\nepididymis, turns around the posterior extremity, and runs forward on\r\nthe free border to the anterior extremity. It is partially embedded in\r\nthe tunica albuginea, and detaches lateral branches which ascend in a\r\ntortuous fashion on each surface of the testicle; these give off small\r\nbranches which enter the gland on the septa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 391.—RIGHT TESTICLE AND SPERMATIC CORD OF HORSE, INCLOSED IN\r\n    TUNICA VAGINALIS.\r\n\r\n  _c_, Tunica vaginalis communis; _g_, prominence caused by tail of\r\n    epididymis; _p_, cremaster externus muscle.

The vein which issues\r\nfrom this plexus usually joins the posterior vena cava on the right\r\nside, the left renal vein on the left side.\r\n\r\nThe =nerves=, derived from the renal and posterior mesenteric plexuses,\r\nform the =spermatic plexus= around the vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE SCROTUM\r\n\r\nThe =scrotum=, in which the testicles and the lower parts of the\r\nspermatic cords are situated, is somewhat globular in form, but is\r\ncommonly asymmetrical, since one testicle—more often the left—is the\r\nlarger and more dependent. It varies in form and appearance in the same\r\nsubject, according to the condition of its subcutaneous muscular tissue.\r\nThe latter contracts on exposure to cold, so that the scrotum is drawn\r\nup and becomes thicker and wrinkled; when relaxed under the influence of\r\nheat or fatigue, or from debility, it becomes smooth and pendulous, with\r\na constriction or neck superiorly. It consists of layers which\r\ncorrespond with those of the abdominal wall; considered from without\r\ninward these are:\r\n\r\n(1) The =skin=, which is thin, elastic, usually black in color, and\r\nsmooth and oily to the touch. It presents scattered short fine hairs,\r\nand is abundantly supplied with very large sebaceous and sweat glands.\r\nIt is marked centrally by a longitudinal furrow, in which is a line, the\r\n=raphé scroti=; this is continued forward on the prepuce and behind on\r\nthe perineum.\r\n\r\n(2) The =dartos= (Tunica dartos) is reddish in color and is closely\r\nadherent to the skin except superiorly. It consists of fibro-elastic\r\ntissue and unstriped muscle. Along the raphé it forms a median\r\npartition, the =septum scroti=, which divides the scrotum into two\r\npouches. Dorsally the septum divides into two layers which diverge on\r\neither side of the penis to join the abdominal tunic. At the bottom of\r\nthe scrotum fibers connect the dartos closely with the tunica vaginalis\r\nand the tail of the epididymis, constituting the =scrotal\r\nligament=.[143] Elsewhere the dartos is loosely connected with the\r\nunderlying tunic by areolar tissue which contains no fat.\r\n\r\n(3) The scrotal =fascia=, which is apparently derived from the oblique\r\nabdominal muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It has been customary to describe three layers of fascia, in\r\n  conformity with the accounts given in text-books of human anatomy.\r\n  These are: (1) the intercolumnar or spermatic fascia, derived from the\r\n  margin of the external inguinal ring; (2) the cremasteric fascia,\r\n  derived from the internal oblique muscle; (3) the infundibuliform\r\n  fascia, derived from the fascia transversalis. The first two cannot be\r\n  distinguished by dissection and the third is (in the scrotum) fused\r\n  with the parietal peritoneum of the tunica vaginalis.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) =The parietal layer of the tunica vaginalis.=—This is a fibro-serous\r\nsac which is continuous with the parietal peritoneum of the abdomen at\r\nthe internal inguinal ring. It is thin above, but is thick in its\r\nscrotal part, where it is strengthened by fibrous tissue (Lamina\r\nfibrosa) derived from the transversalis fascia. It will be described\r\nfurther under the caption tunica vaginalis.[144]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE VAS DEFERENS\r\n\r\nThis tube (Ductus deferens) extends from the tail of the epididymis to\r\nthe ejaculatory duct. It passes upward in the inguinal canal, inclosed\r\nin a fold detached from the inner surface of the mesorchium, near the\r\nposterior (attached) border of the latter. At the vaginal ring it\r\nseparates from the other constituents of the spermatic cord, and turns\r\nbackward and inward into the pelvic cavity (Fig. 272). For some distance\r\nit lies in the free edge of the urogenital fold, by which it is attached\r\nto the lower part of the lateral wall of the pelvis. In its further\r\ncourse (over the dorsal surface of the bladder) it leaves the edge of\r\nthe fold and inclines inward between its layers, coming in contact with\r\nthe inner face of the vesicula seminalis. Over the neck of the bladder\r\nthe two vasa lie very close together, flanked laterally by the necks of\r\nthe vesiculæ seminales, and having the uterus masculinus between them.\r\nThey then disappear under the isthmus of the prostate, and are continued\r\nthrough the wall of the urethra by the =ejaculatory ducts=. The latter\r\nare formed in the urethral wall by the union of the vas deferens with\r\nthe duct (or neck) of the corresponding vesicula seminalis; they are\r\nthin-walled tubes, about 2 to 3 mm. long and 6 to 7 mm. wide, which open\r\ninto the urethra on either side of the colliculus seminalis. In about 15\r\nper cent. of subjects the vas deferens and duct of the seminal vesicle\r\ndo not unite, but open side by side into the urethra. From its origin\r\nuntil it reaches the dorsal surface of the bladder the vas deferens has\r\na uniform diameter of about a quarter of an inch (ca. 6 mm.). It then\r\nforms a fusiform dilatation, the =ampulla ductus deferentis= (Fig. 394);\r\nthis part is about six to eight inches (ca. 15 to 20 cm.) long, and in\r\nits largest part nearly an inch (ca. 2 cm.) in diameter in the stallion;\r\nin geldings the dilatation is usually not very pronounced. Beyond the\r\nampulla the duct abruptly contracts.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The wall of the vas deferens is thick and the lumen\r\nrelatively small, so that the tube has a firm and cord-like character.\r\nIt is covered with peritoneum, except in the last few inches of its\r\ncourse. The loose =adventitia= contains numerous vessels and nerves. The\r\nthick =muscular coat= consists of longitudinal and circular layers. The\r\n=mucous membrane= has an epithelium of short columnar cells. In the\r\nposterior part of the tube, and especially in the ampulla, there are\r\nnumerous tubulo-alveolar glands.\r\n\r\n=Blood-supply.=—Spermatic and umbilical arteries.\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—Spermatic and pelvic plexuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SPERMATIC CORD\r\n\r\nThe =spermatic cord= (Funiculus spermaticus) consists of the structures\r\ncarried down by the testicle in its migration through the inguinal canal\r\nfrom the abdominal cavity to the scrotum. It begins at the internal\r\ninguinal ring, where its constituent parts come together, extends\r\nobliquely downward through the inguinal canal, passes over the side of\r\nthe penis, and ends at the attached border of the testicle. It consists\r\nof the following structures:\r\n\r\n(1) The =spermatic artery=.\r\n\r\n(2) The =spermatic veins=, which form the pampiniform plexus around the\r\nartery.\r\n\r\n(3) The =lymphatics=, which accompany the veins.\r\n\r\n(4) Sympathetic =nerves=, which run with the artery.\r\n\r\n(5) The =vas deferens=.\r\n\r\n(6) The =internal cremaster muscle=, which consists of bundles of\r\nunstriped muscular tissue.\r\n\r\n(7) The =visceral layer= of the =tunica vaginalis= or =mesorchium=.\r\n\r\nThe first four of these constituents are gathered into a rounded mass\r\nwhich forms the anterior part of the cord; they are united by connective\r\ntissue, interspersed with which are bundles of the cremaster internus.\r\nThe vas deferens is situated posteriorly, inclosed in a special fold\r\ndetached from the inner surface of the mesorchium; hence it is not\r\nvisible externally.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The term spermatic cord is to a certain extent misleading as applied\r\n  to most animals, while in man the structure is distinctly cord-like.\r\n  In the horse, when the tunica vaginalis is slit open and the “cord”\r\n  stretched out, the latter is seen to have the form of a wide sheet,\r\n  the mesorchium, which has a thick, rounded anterior edge, the\r\n  so-called “vascular part” of the cord. The posterior edge of the\r\n  mesorchium is continuous with the parietal layer of the tunic; its\r\n  inner surface presents posteriorly the deferential fold (Plica ductus\r\n  deferentis). Between the two layers of the mesorchium are bundles of\r\n  unstriped muscle (cremaster internus) and small vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE TUNICA VAGINALIS\r\n\r\nThe =tunica vaginalis= is a somewhat pyriform serous sac which extends\r\nfrom the internal inguinal ring through the inguinal canal to the bottom\r\nof the scrotum. Like the abdominal peritoneum, of which it is an\r\nevagination, it consists of two layers—parietal and visceral. The\r\n=parietal layer=, or =tunica vaginalis communis= (s. reflexa), lines the\r\nscrotum below; its narrow, tubular part lies in the inguinal canal and\r\nis directly continuous with the parietal peritoneum of the abdomen at\r\nthe internal inguinal ring. The =cavity= of the tunica vaginalis (Cavum\r\nvaginale) is a diverticulum of the general peritoneal cavity, with which\r\nit communicates through the =vaginal ring= (Annulus vaginalis). It\r\ncontains normally a small quantity of serous fluid. The parietal layer\r\nis reflected from the posterior wall of the inguinal canal around the\r\nstructures of the cord, forming the =mesorchium=, a fold analogous to\r\nthe mesentery of the intestine. The =visceral layer=, or =tunica\r\nvaginalis propria=, covers the spermatic cord, testicle, and epididymis.\r\n\r\nThe =external cremaster muscle= (M. cremaster externus) lies on the\r\nouter and posterior part of the tunic, to the scrotal part of which it\r\nis attached.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Confusion has arisen from the use of the term internal abdominal or\r\n  inguinal ring in two senses. The term is used to designate the upper\r\n  or abdominal opening of the inguinal canal, but it is also applied to\r\n  the upper opening of the cavity of the tunica vaginalis. It should\r\n  only be applied to the abdominal opening of the canal, the\r\n  =subperitoneal ring=. The =peritoneal ring= at which the cavity of the\r\n  tunica vaginalis opens into the general peritoneal sac is\r\n  distinguished by the name =vaginal ring=. It is placed about four or\r\n  five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) from the linea alba, and about two or\r\n  three inches (ca. 6 to 8 cm.) in front of the ilio-pectineal eminence.\r\n  In stallions it will usually admit the end of the finger readily, but\r\n  it may be abnormally large and allow a loop of bowel to enter the\r\n  cavity of the tunica vaginalis. In the gelding it is smaller and\r\n  sometimes partially occluded. In man the cavity is almost always\r\n  obliterated early, except in its scrotal portion, thus abolishing the\r\n  vaginal ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 393.—DIAGRAM OF CROSS-SECTION OF SPERMATIC CORD AND TUNICA\r\n    VAGINALIS; LATTER REPRESENTED AS DISTENDED.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DESCENT OF THE TESTICLES\r\n\r\nDuring early fœtal life the testicle is situated against the dorsal wall\r\nof the abdominal cavity, in contact with the ventral surface of the\r\ncorresponding kidney. As growth proceeds it gradually migrates from this\r\nprimitive position, and finally passes down the inguinal canal into the\r\nscrotum. Previous to its descent through the abdominal wall the testicle\r\nis suspended by a fold of peritoneum, termed the =mesorchium=. This fold\r\ncontains the vessels and nerves of the testicle in its anterior border.\r\nIn its posterior edge is the elongated tail of the epididymis, and two\r\ncords of fibrous tissue and unstriped muscle. One of these cords is\r\nshort and connects the tail of the epididymis with the testicle; later\r\nit becomes shorter, and is termed the ligament of the epididymis. The\r\nother cord, the =gubernaculum testis=, extends from the tail of the\r\nepididymis to the subperitoneal tissue in the vicinity of the future\r\nvaginal ring. The =deferential fold= (Plica ductus deferentis) is given\r\noff from the inner face of the mesorchium, and joins the urogenital fold\r\nposteriorly. The body of the epididymis at this time lies in the edge of\r\nan oblique fold formed by the outer layer of the mesorchium. After the\r\nmiddle of fœtal life, a pouch or diverticulum of the peritoneum, the\r\n=processus vaginalis=, grows downward through the inguinal canal,\r\ncarrying with it cremaster fibers derived from the internal oblique\r\nmuscle and a layer from the transversalis fascia. It is accompanied by\r\nan inguinal extension of the gubernaculum testis. The latter blends\r\nbelow with the subcutaneous tissue which later becomes the dartos. The\r\ntail of the epididymis first enters the processus vaginalis, followed by\r\nthe testicle with its mesorchium, which descends within this\r\ndiverticulum of the peritoneum until it reaches the scrotum. The vas\r\ndeferens and its fold descend synchronously with the epididymis and\r\ntesticle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The mechanical factors concerned in the migration of the testicle are\r\n  matters on which much uncertainty still exists. That the gubernaculum\r\n  exerts sufficient traction to guide the epididymis and testicle to the\r\n  inguinal canal seems plausible. The internal inguinal ring may\r\n  constitute a locus minoris resistentiæ in the abdominal wall,\r\n  especially after the descent of the processus vaginalis. Progressive\r\n  shortening of the gubernaculum was formerly considered to be the chief\r\n  cause of the descent through the abdominal wall. Increase in the\r\n  intra-abdominal pressure is probably an important factor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foal the descent of the testicles is often complete at birth, but\r\nit frequently happens that one testicle or both may be retained in the\r\ninguinal canal or in the abdomen for some months. In other cases the\r\ntesticle may return into the canal or abdomen, since in the young foal\r\nthe vaginal ring is large and the testicle small and soft, and not yet\r\nclosely anchored by the scrotal ligament. In rare cases the descent may\r\nbe completed as late as the fourth year (personal observation).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Indefinite retention of one testicle or both in the abdominal cavity\r\n  or inguinal canal is not rare in horses; this condition is termed\r\n  cryptorchism. Abdominal retention is the more usual form of\r\n  cryptorchism in adult horses, inguinal retention being usually\r\n  temporary. The retained testicle is usually, but not always, small,\r\n  thin, soft, and flabby, and is non-spermiogenic. The processus\r\n  vaginalis and the inguinal part of the gubernaculum are usually\r\n  present, but may be rudimentary. The ligament of the epididymis and\r\n  the corresponding part of the mesorechium are often so long that the\r\n  tail of the epididymis may be several inches distant from the\r\n  testicle. The abdominal part of the gubernaculum may be 8 to 10 inches\r\n  (ca. 20 to 25 cm.) long, and the ligament of the epididymis much\r\n  elongated (10 to 15 cm. in length according to Vennerholm); thus the\r\n  testicle may have a wide range. The vaginal ring is sometimes closed.\r\n\r\n  In many mammals the testicles normally remain in the abdominal cavity;\r\n  such animals are termed testiconda, and include the elephant, some\r\n  insectivora, hyrax, sloths, ant-eaters, armadillos, and cetacea. In\r\n  others the testicles descend periodically during the period of œstrum,\r\n  and then return into the abdomen, or they may be extruded and\r\n  retracted voluntarily; this is true of most rodents, many insectivora\r\n  (moles, shrews, hedgehog), and bats.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE VESICULAE SEMINALES\r\n\r\nThe =vesiculæ seminales= (Fig. 394) are two elongated and somewhat\r\npyriform sacs, which lie on either side of the posterior part of the\r\ndorsal surface of the bladder. They are partly inclosed in the\r\nurogenital fold, and are related to the rectum dorsally. Their long axes\r\nare parallel with the vas deferentia and converge posteriorly. Each\r\nconsists of a rounded blind end, the =fundus=, a middle, slightly\r\nnarrower part, the =body=, and a posterior constricted part, the =neck=\r\nor =duct=.\r\n\r\nIn the stallion they are about six to eight inches (ca. 15 to 20 cm.)\r\nlong, and their greatest diameter is about two inches (ca. 5 cm.); in\r\nthe gelding they are usually much smaller.[145]\r\n\r\nThe vesiculæ are, for the most part, retroperitoneal, but the fundus\r\nextends forward into the urogenital fold and hence has a serous\r\ncovering. The =neck= or =duct= (Ductus excretorius) dips under the\r\nprostate, and usually unites with the end of the vas deferens to form\r\nthe =ejaculatory duct=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 394.—INTERNAL GENITAL ORGANS OF STALLION, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  On left side urethral muscle has been removed over bulbo-urethral\r\n    gland. Cornua of uterus masculinus are indicated in urogenital fold.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The wall, exclusive of the partial serous coat, consists of\r\na fibrous =adventitia=, a middle =muscular coat=, and a =mucous lining=.\r\nThe muscular coat is thickest at the fundus, and consists of two planes\r\nof longitudinal fibers with a circular layer between them. The mucous\r\nmembrane is thin, and is arranged in numerous folds which form a\r\nnetwork; the spaces so inclosed present the openings of tubulo-alveolar\r\nglands. The epithelium is columnar. The =blood-supply= is derived from\r\nthe =internal pudic artery=.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PROSTATE\r\n\r\nThe =prostate= (Prostata) is a musculo-glandular organ which lies on the\r\nneck of the bladder and the beginning of the urethra, beneath the\r\nrectum. It consists of two lateral lobes and a connecting isthmus.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral lobes=, right and left (Lobus dexter et sinister), are\r\nsomewhat prismatic in form, and are directed forward, outward, and\r\nsomewhat upward. The antero-internal surface of each lobe is concave and\r\npartly embraces the corresponding vesicula seminalis. The dorsal surface\r\nis concave and is in relation with the rectum. The ventral surface is\r\nconvex and lies on the obturator internus muscle and fat. The apex is\r\npointed and lies near the posterior end of the superior ischiatic spine.\r\n\r\nThe =isthmus= is a thin, transverse band, about four-fifths of an inch\r\n(ca. 2 cm.) wide. It lies over the junction of the bladder with the\r\nurethra, the uterus masculinus, the terminal parts of the vasa\r\ndeferentia, and the necks of the vesiculæ seminales. Dorsally it is\r\npartly covered by transverse fibers of the urethral (Wilson’s) muscle.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The prostate is inclosed in a fibro-muscular =capsule=,\r\nwhich sends thick, somewhat radially arranged =trabeculæ= into the gland\r\nsubstance, dividing it into spheroidal or ovoid =lobules=. The lobules\r\ncontain a central space in which the prostatic secretion (Succus\r\nprostaticus) collects. The walls of these spaces are pouched out to form\r\ntubular diverticula, and the latter present saccular dilatations. These\r\ncavities are all lined by cubical epithelium. There are 15 to 20\r\n=prostatic ducts= (Ductus prostatici) on either side, which perforate\r\nthe urethra and open lateral to the colliculus seminalis. The\r\n=blood-supply= is derived from the =internal pudic artery=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The surface of the prostate is commonly tuberculate in old subjects,\r\n  and amyloid bodies and calcareous concretions may be found in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE UTERUS MASCULINUS\r\n\r\nThe =uterus masculinus= or =prostatic utricle= is a rudimentary\r\nstructure of variable size and form, situated centrally on the posterior\r\npart of the dorsal surface of the bladder. When well developed, it\r\nconsists of a median flattened tube, some three or four inches (ca. 7.5\r\nto 10 cm.) long, and about half an inch (ca. 1 to 1.5 cm.) wide, the\r\nanterior part of which lies in the urogenital fold and gives off two\r\nslender processes or cornua; the latter curve forward and outward in the\r\nfold a variable distance, being sometimes traceable as far as the\r\nanterior end of the ampulla of the vas deferens. The posterior extremity\r\nof the tube passes under the isthmus of the prostate, and opens into the\r\nurethra on the summit of the colliculus or joins an ejaculatory duct. It\r\nhas a muscular coat and a mucous lining. In many cases it consists\r\nmerely of a very small central tubule with a blind anterior end, or a\r\nband, not at all sharply marked off from the adjacent tissue; in other\r\ncases it cannot be recognized. It is interesting chiefly as being a\r\nremnant of the ducts of Müller and the homologue of the uterus and\r\nvagina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE BULBO-URETHRAL GLANDS\r\n\r\nThe =bulbo-urethral= (or Cowper’s) =glands= (Glandulæ bulbourethrales)\r\nare two in number, and are situated on either side of the pelvic part of\r\nthe urethra close to the ischial arch (Fig. 452). They are covered by\r\nthe urethral (Wilson’s) muscle. They are ovoid in form, somewhat\r\ndepressed dorso-ventrally, and their long axes are directed obliquely\r\nforward and outward. In the stallion they may measure about two inches\r\n(ca. 5 cm.) in length, and an inch or more (ca. 3 cm.) in width. In the\r\ngelding they are about the size of an average hazel nut.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—They resemble the prostate in general structure, but the\r\ninterstitial tissue is much less abundant, especially in regard to its\r\nmuscular elements. In the peripheral part there are striped\r\nmuscle-fibers. Each gland has six to eight =excretory ducts= (Ductus\r\nexcretorii) which open into the urethra on a series of small papillæ\r\nbehind the prostatic ducts and close to the median plane. The\r\n=blood-supply= comes from the =internal pudic artery=.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE PENIS\r\n\r\nThe =penis=, the male organ of copulation, is composed essentially of\r\nerectile tissue, and incloses the extrapelvic part of the urethra. It\r\nextends from the ischial arch forward between the thighs on to the\r\numbilical region of the abdominal wall. It is supported by the fascia\r\npenis and the skin, and its prescrotal portion is situated in a\r\ncutaneous pouch, the prepuce or sheath. It is cylindrical in form, but\r\nmuch compressed laterally in the greater part of its extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 395.—PENIS OF HORSE, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the quiescent state it is about 20 inches (ca. 50 cm.) long; of\r\n  this, about 6 to 8 inches (ca. 15 to 20 cm.) is free in the prepuce.\r\n  In erection it increases 50 per cent. or more in length.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be divided into a root, a body, and a terminal enlargement, the\r\nglans.\r\n\r\nThe =root= (Radix penis) is attached to the lateral parts of the ischial\r\narch by two =crura=, which converge and unite below the arch (Fig. 452).\r\nThe urethra passes over the ischial arch between the crura, and curves\r\nforward to become incorporated with the penis.\r\n\r\nThe =body= (Corpus penis) begins at the junction of the crura and\r\nconstitutes the bulk of the organ. At its origin it is attached to the\r\nsymphysis ischii by two strong flat bands, the =suspensory ligaments= of\r\nthe penis (Ligamenta suspensoria penis), which blend with the tendon of\r\norigin of the graciles muscles (Figs. 451, 456). This part of the penis\r\nis flattened laterally for the most part, but becomes rounded and\r\nsmaller anteriorly. It presents four surfaces. The =dorsal surface= or\r\n=dorsum penis=, is narrow and rounded; on it are the dorsal arteries and\r\nnerves of the penis and a rich venous plexus. The =ventral= or =urethral\r\nsurface= (Facies urethralis) is rounded, and along it runs the urethra,\r\nembedded in the deep =urethral groove= of the corpus cavernosum. The\r\n=lateral surfaces= are high and flattened, except anteriorly, where they\r\nare lower and rounded.\r\n\r\nThe =glans penis= is the enlarged free end of the organ. It is marked\r\noff from the body by a faintly marked =neck= (Collum glandis). In front\r\nof this is a prominent circular ridge, the =corona glandis=, which is\r\nnotched below. The base of the glans is rounded and extends further\r\nbackward dorsally than ventrally; it is marked in its lower part by a\r\ndeep depression, the =fossa glandis=, in which the urethra protrudes for\r\nabout an inch (ca. 2.5 cm.) as a free tube, the =urethral process=\r\n(Processus urethræ), covered by a thin integument. The urethra is thus\r\nsurrounded by a circular fossa, which opens superiorly into the\r\n=urethral sinus=, a bilocular diverticulum lined by thin black skin.\r\nThis diverticulum is filled sometimes with a caseous mass of sebaceous\r\nmatter and epithelial débris.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The penis consists essentially of two erectile bodies, the\r\ncorpus cavernosum penis and the corpus spongiosum.\r\n\r\nThe =corpus cavernosum penis= forms the greater part of the bulk of the\r\npenis except at its free extremity. It arises from each side of the\r\nischial arch by a =crus=, which is embedded in the ischio-cavernosus\r\nmuscle. Below the ischial arch the crura fuse completely to form the\r\nlaterally compressed body of the corpus cavernosum; this presents\r\nventrally the =urethral groove= (Sulcus urethralis), which contains the\r\nurethra and corpus spongiosum. Anteriorly, the corpus cavernosum divides\r\ninto three processes, a long central one, which is capped by the glans\r\npenis, and two short blunt lateral ones. The corpus cavernosum is\r\ninclosed by the =tunica albuginea=, a thick capsule of fibrous tissue\r\nwhich contains many elastic fibers and some unstriped muscle. Externally\r\nthe fibers are chiefly longitudinal; internally they are mainly circular\r\nand are looser in arrangement. Numerous =trabeculæ= pass inward from the\r\ntunic and form a sponge-like framework in the interior of the corpus\r\ncavernosum, which is thus divided into numerous spaces (Cavernæ). These\r\nspaces may be regarded as greatly enlarged capillaries; they contain\r\nblood, are lined with flat endothelial cells, and are directly\r\ncontinuous with the veins of the penis. Their walls are composed very\r\nlargely of unstriped muscle. Erection is produced by distention of these\r\nspaces with blood; at other times the spaces are mere slits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 396.—CROSS-SECTION OF BODY OF PENIS OF HORSE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  In man there are two distinct corpora cavernosa, separated by a\r\n  complete septum penis, except in the middle part of the organ, where\r\n  the septum is composed of vertical trabeculæ, between which are\r\n  slit-like intervals; through the latter the blood-spaces of the two\r\n  corpora cavernosa communicate. In the horse no distinct septum exists\r\n  except near the root, but in the proximal and distal parts of the\r\n  corpus cavernosum there are vertical trabeculæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =corpus spongiosum= or =corpus cavernosum urethræ= forms a tube\r\naround the urethra, and is much enlarged at its free end to form the\r\nbulk of the glans penis; throughout the remainder of its course it is\r\npractically uniform in size, and does not form any very distinct bulb\r\n(Bulbus urethræ) at its origin, as in man and many animals. The glans\r\nhas been described in part; it should be noted that the corpus\r\nspongiosum extends backward dorsally a distance of about four inches\r\n(ca. 10 cm.) on the middle process of the corpus cavernosum penis,\r\nforming the processus dorsalis glandis. The urethral process is covered\r\nby a thin layer of corpus spongiosum.\r\n\r\nIn structure the corpus spongiosum has a general resemblance to the\r\ncorpus cavernosum, but the trabeculæ are finer and more elastic. In the\r\nglans the trabeculæ are highly elastic, and the spaces are large and\r\nvery extensible; the latter are continuous at the extremity of the\r\nprocessus dorsalis with large veins on the dorsum penis. There is a\r\npartial septum glandis. The skin covering the glans is thin, destitute\r\nof glands, and richly supplied with nerves and special nerve-endings.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The penis is supplied with blood by three\r\n=arteries=, viz., the =internal pudic=, =obturator=, and =external\r\npudic=. The =veins= form a rich plexus on the dorsum and sides of the\r\npenis, which is drained by the =external pudic= and =obturator veins=;\r\nfrom the root the blood is carried by the =internal pudic veins=. The\r\n=lymphatics= run with the veins and go to the inguinal and lumbar\r\nglands. The =nerves= are derived chiefly from the =pudic nerves= and the\r\n=pelvic plexus= of the sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n            MUSCLES OF THE PENIS (Figs. 183, 451, 452, 456)\r\n\r\n1. The =ischio-cavernosus= (or erector penis) is a short but strong\r\npaired muscle, which arises from the tuber ischii and the adjacent part\r\nof the sacro-sciatic ligament, and is inserted on the crus and adjacent\r\npart of the body of the penis. It is somewhat fusiform, incloses the\r\ncrus as in a sheath, and is situated in a deep depression in the\r\nsemimembranosus muscle. It pulls the penis against the pelvis, and\r\nassists in producing and maintaining erection by compressing the dorsal\r\nveins of the penis. Its blood-supply is derived from the obturator\r\nartery, and the nerve-supply from the pudic nerve.\r\n\r\n2. The =retractor penis= is an unstriped muscle which arises on the\r\nventral surface of the first two or three coccygeal vertebræ. It divides\r\ninto two flat bands, half an inch or more (ca. 1.5 cm.) in width, which\r\npass downward over the sides of the rectum to meet below the anus. Here\r\nthere is a decussation of fibers, thus forming a sort of suspensory\r\napparatus for the posterior part of the rectum and the anus. From the\r\ndecussation the muscle passes for a short distance between superficial\r\nand deep layers of the bulbo-cavernosus, and then along the ventral\r\nsurface of the penis, to which it is loosely attached. Near the glans\r\npenis it splits up into bundles which pass through the bulbo-cavernosus\r\nand are attached to the tunica albuginea. Below the anus the muscle is\r\nattached to the sphincter ani externus. On the penis the two muscles are\r\nintimately united to each other. Their action is to withdraw the penis\r\ninto the sheath after erection or protrusion. The proximal part would\r\ndraw the anus upward and forward and support it during defecation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE PREPUCE\r\n\r\nThe =prepuce= (Præputium), popularly called the “sheath,” is a double\r\ninvagination of the skin which contains and covers the free or\r\nprescrotal portion of the penis when not erect. It consists of two\r\nparts, external and internal. The external part or sheath extends from\r\nthe scrotum forward close to the umbilicus, where the external layer is\r\nreflected ventrally and laterally, forming the thick margin of the\r\n=preputial orifice= (Ostium præputiale); dorsally it is directly\r\ncontinuous with the integument of the abdominal wall. It is marked by a\r\nmedian =raphé præputii=, a continuation of the scrotal raphé. At the\r\nlower margin of the preputial orifice there are often in the stallion\r\ntwo papillæ, which are rudimentary teats or nipples. The internal layer\r\n=passes= backward from the preputial orifice a distance of about six to\r\neight inches (ca. 15 to 20 cm.), lining the cavity of the external\r\nprepuce, and is then reflected forward until it approaches the orifice,\r\nwhere it is again reflected backward. It thus forms within the cavity of\r\nthe sheath a secondary tubular invagination, the prepuce proper, in\r\nwhich the anterior part of the penis lies. This tubular cavity is closed\r\nbehind by the reflection of the internal layer on to the penis to form\r\nthe penile layer of the prepuce. Its orifice is surrounded by a thick\r\nmargin, the =preputial ring= (Annulus præputialis), which is connected\r\nventrally with the outer part of the sheath by the =preputial frenum=\r\n(Frenulum præputii).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The arrangement differs from that found in man in the fact that the\r\n  inner part of the prepuce as described above is equivalent to the\r\n  entire human prepuce. This part, the prepuce proper, is well seen on\r\n  sagittal sections, and can be demonstrated by pulling the penis,\r\n  inclosed in this prepuce, out of the cavity of the sheath; the\r\n  arrangement of the free part of the penis and prepuce is then like\r\n  that in man. (In paraphimosis the penis is strangulated by the\r\n  preputial ring.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 397.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF PREPUCE AND PART OF PENIS OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _P_, Internal part of prepuce or prepuce proper; _P′_, external part\r\n    of prepuce or sheath; _c.p._, preputial cavity; _F.g._, fossa\r\n    glandis; _D_, diverticulum of fossa glandis; _p.u._, processus\r\n    urethræ.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The =external skin= of the prepuce resembles that of the\r\nscrotum. The =inner layers= of skin are hairless, variable in color, and\r\noften irregularly pigmented; they form irregular folds, and are supplied\r\nwith numerous large sebaceous glands and coil glands, which reach their\r\ngreatest size at the preputial ring. Beyond this the glands are absent,\r\nand the skin resembles a non-glandular mucous membrane. The secretion of\r\nthe =preputial glands= (Glandulæ præputiales), together with desquamated\r\nepithelial cells, forms the fatty =smegma præputii=, which has a strong\r\nunpleasant odor, and often accumulates in considerable amount. Beneath\r\nthe skin is a large amount of loose connective tissue, except over the\r\nglans penis, where the skin is closely attached to the tunic of the\r\ncorpus spongiosum. The external part of the prepuce is strengthened by a\r\nlayer of elastic tissue, derived from the abdominal tunic, and termed\r\nthe suspensory ligament.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =arteries= are branches of the =external pudic\r\nartery=, and the =veins= go chiefly to the =external pudic vein=. The\r\n=lymphatics= go to the superficial inguinal and lumbar lymph glands. The\r\n=nerves= are derived from the =pudic=, =ilio-hypogastric=, and\r\n=ilio-inguinal= nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MALE URETHRA\r\n\r\nThe =urethra= of the male (Urethra masculina) is the long mucous tube\r\nwhich extends from the bladder to the glans penis. It passes backward on\r\nthe floor of the pelvis, turns around the ischial arch, forming an acute\r\nangle, and passes forward inclosed in the corpus spongiosum. It may,\r\ntherefore, be divided into two segments, pelvic and extrapelvic.\r\n\r\nThe =pelvic part= (Pars pelvina) is four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12\r\ncm.) long. At its origin it is not distinguishable from the neck of the\r\nbladder in size or structure; in fact no line of demarcation exists\r\nbetween the two. Behind the prostate the tube dilates to a potential\r\nwidth of two inches or more (ca. 5 to 6 cm.). Near the ischial arch,\r\nbetween the bulbo-urethral (Cowper’s) glands, it contracts again,\r\nforming the =isthmus urethræ=. It is related dorsally to the rectum and\r\nthe prostate, ventrally to the internal obturator muscles, and laterally\r\nto the bulbo-urethral glands. It is inclosed, except at its origin, by\r\nthe urethral (Wilson’s) muscle. Beneath this is a rich venous plexus,\r\nforming a sort of erectile tissue.[146]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 398.—PELVIC URETHRA AND POSTERIOR PART OF BLADDER OF HORSE SLIT\r\n    VENTRALLY AND LAID OPEN.\r\n\r\n  _e.d._, Ejaculatory ducts.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =extrapelvic part= (Pars cavernosa) passes between the two crura of\r\nthe penis and runs along the groove on the ventral surface of the corpus\r\ncavernosum penis, inclosed by the corpus spongiosum and the\r\nbulbo-cavernosus muscle. It passes through the glans penis and projects\r\nforward about an inch in the fossa glandis as a free tube, the\r\n=processus urethræ=; this part is covered by a delicate integument,\r\nunder which there is a thin layer of erectile tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The lumen of the tube is largely obliterated in the inactive condition\r\n  of the parts. When moderately distended its dimensions in a horse of\r\n  medium size are as follows: At its origin the diameter is about half\r\n  an inch (1 to 1.5 cm.). The pelvic dilatation at its widest part\r\n  measures one and a half to two inches (ca. 3.5 to 5 cm.) transversely,\r\n  and about an inch (2 to 3 cm.) vertically; it is elliptical in\r\n  cross-section when fully distended. The isthmus at the ischial arch is\r\n  a little smaller than the initial part. Beyond this the lumen is about\r\n  one-half to three-fourths of an inch (ca. 1.5 cm.) in diameter, and is\r\n  fairly uniform to the glans penis. Here there is a slight fusiform\r\n  dilatation (Fossa navicularis), beyond which the tube contracts.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening from the bladder into the urethra is termed the =internal\r\nurethral orifice= (Orificium urethræ internum); it is closed except\r\nduring urination. The terminal opening is the =external urethral\r\norifice= (Orificium urethræ externum) or meatus urinarius. The two\r\norifices of the =ejaculatory ducts= are situated dorsally on either side\r\nof the colliculus seminalis, about two inches (ca. 5 cm.) behind the\r\ninternal urethral orifice; they are slit-like and close together. The\r\nsmall orifice of the uterus masculinus is placed centrally on the\r\ncolliculus; it is inconstant. The orifices of the =prostatic ducts= are\r\non two groups of small papillæ, placed lateral to the openings of the\r\nejaculatory ducts. The =ducts= of the =bulbo-urethral= (Cowper’s)\r\n=glands= open on two lateral series of small papillæ, about an inch (ca.\r\n2.5 cm.) further back and close to the median line. The small orifices\r\nof the =urethral glands= are situated laterally in the wide pelvic\r\nportion.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The =mucous membrane= contains an unusually large amount of\r\nfine elastic fibers, and in its pelvic part there are alveolar =glands=\r\n(Glandulæ urethrales). The epithelium is at first like that of the\r\nbladder, then becomes cylindrical, and in the terminal part is\r\nstratified squamous. In the dorsal wall the membrane forms a median\r\nridge, the =urethral crest= (Crista urethralis); this terminates about\r\ntwo inches from the internal urethral orifice in a rounded elevation,\r\nthe =colliculus seminalis=, on the sides of which the ejaculatory ducts\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nAt the origin of the urethra there is a layer of circular =unstriped\r\nmuscle-fibers= outside of the mucous coat. Beyond this the latter is\r\ninclosed by a layer of =erectile tissue=, composed of plexuses of veins\r\nsupported by trabeculæ of elastic and smooth muscular tissue. This is\r\ncontinued by the corpus spongiosum. Outside of the erectile tissue there\r\nis a continuation of the intrinsic unstriped muscular coat, consisting\r\nof external and internal longitudinal strata, with a layer of circular\r\nfibers between them.\r\n\r\nExcept at its origin and termination the urethra is provided with a\r\ncontinuous layer of striped muscle, placed outside of the erectile\r\ntissue. This is described as consisting of two parts or muscles.\r\n\r\n(1) The =urethral= (or Wilson’s) =muscle= (M. urethralis) consists of\r\ndorsal and ventral layers of transverse fibers on the wide pelvic part\r\nof the urethra, and covers the bulbo-urethral (Cowper’s) glands. It is a\r\ncompressor of the pelvic part of the urethra and the bulbo-urethral\r\nglands. By its forcible contraction it plays an important rôle in the\r\nejaculation of the seminal fluid, and also in evacuating the last of the\r\nurine in micturition.[147]\r\n\r\n(2) The =bulbo-cavernosus muscle= (or accelerator urinæ) is the\r\ncontinuation of the urethral muscle on the extrapelvic part of the\r\nurethra; it extends from the ischial arch to the glans penis. At the\r\nroot of the penis it is the thickest, and forms a complete layer of\r\ncircular fibers which inclose the corpus spongiosum and the urethra.\r\nBeyond this it diminishes very gradually in thickness, and consists of\r\nfibers which arise on a median ventral raphé and curve around the corpus\r\nspongiosum to end on the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum. Its\r\naction is to empty the extrapelvic part of the urethra.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The =ischio-urethral muscles= (Fig. 452) are small bands which arise\r\n  on the ischial arch and crura of the penis and pass forward to become\r\n  lost on the ventral layer of the urethral muscle. They may assist in\r\n  erection of the penis by exerting pressure on the dorsal veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MALE GENITAL ORGANS OF THE OX\r\n\r\nThe =scrotum= is situated somewhat further forward than in the horse. It\r\nis long, pendulous, and has a well-marked neck. The skin here is usually\r\nflesh-colored, but in some breeds is more or less pigmented; it is\r\nsparsely covered with short hairs. Just in front of it are four\r\n(sometimes only two) rudimentary teats.\r\n\r\nThe =testicles= are relatively larger than those of the horse, and have\r\nan elongated, oval outline. The long axis is vertical. The inner surface\r\nis somewhat flattened.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A testicle of an adult bull measures on the average about four or five\r\n  inches (10 to 12 cm.) in length, exclusive of the epididymis; with the\r\n  latter the length is about six inches (15 cm.). The width is about two\r\n  and a half to three inches (ca. 6 to 8 cm.), and the antero-posterior\r\n  diameter about the same. The weight is about nine or ten ounces (ca.\r\n  250 to 300 grams).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 399.—GENERAL VIEW OF GENITAL ORGANS OF BULL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe tunica albuginea is thin. The parenchyma is yellowish in color. The\r\nmediastinum testis descends from the anterior part of the upper\r\nextremity deeply into the gland as an axial strand about 5 mm. in\r\nthickness. The vasa efferentia leave at the upper end of the\r\nmediastinum.\r\n\r\nThe =epididymis= is very closely attached to the testicle. The head is\r\nlong; it curves over the upper extremity and nearly half-way down the\r\nanterior border of the testicle. The body is very narrow, and lies along\r\nthe outer part of the posterior border of the testicle, to which it is\r\nattached by a narrow peritoneal fold. The tail is large and is closely\r\nattached to the lower extremity of the testicle.\r\n\r\nThe =spermatic cord= and the =tunica vaginalis= are much longer than in\r\nthe horse; the extra-inguinal part of the cord is about eight to ten\r\ninches (20 to 25 cm.) in length. The =cremaster externus= is well\r\ndeveloped, and almost completely incloses the tunic to the nook of the\r\nscrotum; it does not extend so far down as in the horse, but is inserted\r\nabout at the level of the upper pole of the testicle. The =vaginal ring=\r\nis relatively very small, and is about four inches (ca. 10 cm.) from the\r\nlinea alba. The cremaster internus is feeble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 400.—INTERNAL GENITAL ORGANS OF BULL; DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The right vesicula is sectioned frontally. The dotted line indicates\r\n    the backward extension of the peritoneum.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The spermatic cords emerge through the outer angles of the external\r\n  inguinal rings, and curve downward and inward to the neck of the\r\n  scrotum. The external rings are about four inches (ca. 10 cm.) long,\r\n  and are two and a half to three inches (6 to 8 cm.) apart. In animals\r\n  in good condition there is a large mass of fat above the neck of the\r\n  scrotum, between the spermatic cords. The mesorchium extends to the\r\n  bottom of the tunica vaginalis forming a narrow fold (ca. 1 cm. wide)\r\n  which attaches the epididymis to the posterior part of the tunic.\r\n\r\n  The inguinal canal presents several special features in the bull. The\r\n  internal ring is very long. Its anterior border, formed by the edge of\r\n  the internal oblique, is decidedly concave and is tendinous in its\r\n  inner part. The long axis of the external ring is directed outward,\r\n  forward, and downward. The spermatic cord lies in its outer part, the\r\n  external pudic vessels in its middle. A muscular band about an inch\r\n  wide, detached from the internal oblique muscle, crosses the outer\r\n  side of the vaginal ring.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =vas deferens= is small in caliber. The urogenital fold is narrow,\r\nso that the vasa are closer together in it than in the horse. On\r\nreaching the posterior part of the bladder they are in apposition for a\r\ndistance of about four inches (10 cm.), flanked and overlapped by the\r\nvesiculæ seminales. They form ampullæ about four or five inches (10 to\r\n12 cm.) long and half an inch (1.2 to 1.5 cm.) wide, the mucous lining\r\nof which is plicated. They then pass under the body of the prostate and\r\nunite with the ducts of the vesiculæ seminales to form the ejaculatory\r\nducts. The latter have slit-like openings on either side of the\r\ncolliculus seminalis.\r\n\r\nThe =vesiculæ seminales= are not bladder-like sacs, as in the horse, but\r\nare compact glandular organs with a lobulated surface. In the adult they\r\nmeasure about four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) in length, two\r\ninches (5 cm.) in width in their largest part, and an inch or more (ca.\r\n3 cm.) in thickness. The dorsal surface of each faces upward and inward\r\nand is partially covered with peritoneum. The ventral surface faces in\r\nthe opposite direction and is non-peritoneal. Each may be regarded as\r\nconsisting of a very thick-walled, sacculated tube, bent on itself in a\r\ntortuous manner. This tube, if straightened out, would be about ten\r\ninches (25 cm.) in length. They are commonly unsymmetrical in size and\r\nshape. Short branches are often given off from the chief tube. The\r\nexcretory duct or neck joins the outer side of the vas deferens at an\r\nacute angle to form the ejaculatory duct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 401.—ANTERIOR EXTREMITY OF PENIS OF BULL, LEFT VIEW. (After\r\n    Böhm.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 402.—CROSS-SECTION OF PELVIC URETHRA OF BULL.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Prostate gland (pars disseminata); _2_, urethra; _3_, urethral\r\n    muscle; _4_, aponeurosis. The lumen of the urethra is black.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The structure of the vesicula is masked by a thick capsule of fibrous\r\n  tissue and unstriped muscle, which maintains it in its bent condition\r\n  and also sends trabeculæ between the alveoli. There is a central canal\r\n  into which the secretion formed in the alveoli passes. The cavities\r\n  (central canal and alveoli) are lined with columnar epithelium. On\r\n  account of this structure the term glandulæ vesiculares is preferred\r\n  by some anatomists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =prostate= is pale yellow in color, and consists of two parts. The\r\n=body= (Corpus prostatæ) is a mass which stretches across the dorsal\r\nsurface of the neck of the bladder and the origin of the urethra. It\r\nmeasures about an inch and a half (ca. 3.5 to 4 cm.) transversely, and\r\nabout half an inch (ca. 1 to 1.5 cm.) in width and thickness. The =pars\r\ndisseminata= surrounds the pelvic part of the urethra; dorsally it forms\r\na layer about half an inch (ca. 10 to 12 mm.) thick, but ventrally it is\r\nquite thin. It is concealed by the urethral (Wilson’s) muscle; hence it\r\noften escapes notice, but is very evident on cross-section (fig. 402).\r\nThe =prostatic ducts= open into the urethra in rows between two folds of\r\nthe mucous membrane which proceed backward from the colliculus\r\nseminalis.\r\n\r\nThe =uterus masculinus= appears to be absent frequently. Ellenberger\r\nstates that it opens between the ejaculatory ducts, while Martin says\r\nthat it usually has two orifices at the colliculus, but that it often\r\nunites with the vasa deferentia.\r\n\r\nThe =bulbo-urethral= (Cowper’s) =glands= are somewhat smaller than in\r\nthe stallion. They are liable to escape notice, since they are covered\r\nby a thick layer of dense fibrous tissue and also partially by the\r\nbulbo-cavernosus muscle. Each has a single duct which opens into the\r\nurethra under cover of a fold of the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nThe =penis= is cylindrical, and is longer and of very much smaller\r\ndiameter than in the horse. Just behind the scrotum it forms an\r\n=S=-shaped curve, the =sigmoid flexure=; thus about one foot is folded\r\nup when the penis is fully retracted. The flexure is effaced during\r\nerection. The =glans penis= is about three inches (ca. 8 cm.) in length.\r\nIt is flattened dorso-ventrally, and its extremity is pointed and\r\ntwisted. The =external urethral orifice= is situated at the end of a\r\ngroove formed by this twist; it is only large enough to admit a probe of\r\nmedium size. Even in the non-erect state the penis is remarkably dense\r\nand firm. The =tunica albuginea= is very thick, and incloses the\r\nurethra. In the first part, as far as the first curve, there is a thick\r\nmedian =septum penis=. Beyond this there is a central axial rod of dense\r\nfibrous tissue from which numerous strong trabeculæ radiate. The\r\nerectile tissue is small in amount, so that the organ undergoes very\r\nlittle enlargement in erection.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The length of the penis in the adult is about three feet (ca. 90 cm.).\r\n  The crura are flattened laterally. The suspensory ligaments are\r\n  attached to the ventral ridge on the symphysis. The body is somewhat\r\n  flattened dorso-ventrally beyond the first curve. The extremity of the\r\n  glans is unsymmetrical, the urethral orifice being situated\r\n  ventro-laterally. The glans contains little erectile tissue, and hence\r\n  undergoes little enlargement in erection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =bulbo-cavernosus muscle= presents several remarkable features. It\r\nis for the greater part an inch or more (ca. 3 cm.) in thickness, but\r\nits length is only six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm.). It is covered by\r\na strong aponeurosis, and is divided by a median raphé into two lateral\r\nhalves except at its origin. It diminishes in size from behind forward,\r\nand its anterior extremity is pointed.\r\n\r\nThe =ischio-cavernosus muscle= resembles in general that of the horse,\r\nbut is flattened laterally. It is covered by a close aponeurosis.\r\n\r\nThe =retractor penis= muscle resembles that of the horse in origin. Its\r\ntwo parts are about an inch (ca. 2 to 5 cm.) apart on the root of the\r\npenis, where they lie in a groove on either side of the\r\nbulbo-cavernosus. They then come close together and pass on either side\r\nof the ventral curve of the sigmoid flexure. Further forward they lie\r\nalong the ventral aspect of the penis, and end about five or six inches\r\n(ca. 12 to 15 cm.) behind the glans.\r\n\r\nThe =prepuce= is very long and narrow. Its orifice is about two inches\r\n(ca. 5 cm.) behind the umbilicus; it is only large enough to admit a\r\nfinger readily, and is surrounded by long hairs. The cavity of the\r\nsheath is about fifteen inches (35 to 40 cm.) long, and a little over an\r\ninch (ca. 3 cm.) in diameter. The lining membrane forms longitudinal\r\nfolds; it is covered with squamous stratified epithelium, and has coiled\r\ntubular glands. The penile layer is glandless, and is reddish in color.\r\nIt presents lymph nodules in its posterior part.\r\n\r\nThere are two pairs of =preputial muscles= which are derivatives of the\r\npanniculus carnosus. The anterior pair, the =protractors= of the prepuce\r\n(Mm. præputiales craniales), are two flat bands, two inches or more (5\r\nto 6 cm.) in width, which arise close together in the xiphoid region,\r\nabout eight inches (20 cm.) in front of the preputial orifice. Traced\r\nbackward they diverge, leaving the umbilicus and an area about one and a\r\nhalf inches wide free, and then unite behind the preputial orifice. They\r\ndraw the prepuce forward. The posterior pair, the =retractors= of the\r\nprepuce (Mm. præputiales caudales), arise in the inguinal region and\r\nconverge on the anterior part of the prepuce. They draw the prepuce\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\n\r\n  These muscles are subject to a good deal of variation. The retractor\r\n  may be absent. Many fibers come in from the panniculus on either side,\r\n  dip under the protractor, and are inserted into the skin just behind\r\n  the preputial opening. The homologue of the protractor is present in\r\n  the cow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =urethra= in its pelvic part is about five inches (12 cm.) long, and\r\nis of relatively small and uniform caliber. The =urethral= (Wilson’s)\r\n=muscle= incloses the tube ventrally and laterally; it is very thick,\r\ncrescentic in cross-section, and is covered by an aponeurosis. Dorsally,\r\nthe aponeurosis is thick and the muscle absent. Inside of these the pars\r\ndisseminata of the prostate surrounds the urethra as far back as the\r\nbulbo-urethral glands. The =colliculus seminalis= is short, but\r\nprominent; from it the urethral crest extends forward to the trigonum\r\nvesicæ. The extrapelvic part has an enlargement, the =bulb=, at its\r\norigin; it then gradually diminishes in diameter, and is relatively very\r\nsmall at its termination. Other features have been mentioned in\r\npreceding paragraphs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 403.—ANTERIOR PART OF PENIS OF RAM.\r\n\r\n  _A_, Right side; _B_, left side. (After Böhm.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the ram the urethra lies in a groove on the ventral surface of the\r\ncorpus cavernosum. Its terminal part projects commonly 3 to 4 cm. beyond\r\nthe glans penis, forming a twisted processus urethræ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MALE GENITAL ORGANS OF THE PIG\r\n\r\nThe =scrotum= is situated a short distance from the anus, and is not so\r\nsharply defined from the surrounding parts as in the other animals.\r\n\r\nThe =testicles= are very large and are soft in texture. Their long axis\r\nis almost vertical, the free border being posterior and the tail of the\r\nepididymis dorsal. The mediastinum testis is well developed. The\r\nepididymis is closely attached to the testicle and the tunica vaginalis;\r\nthe tail is specially large.\r\n\r\nThe =spermatic cord= is necessarily very long (20 to 25 cm. in a boar of\r\nmedium size). The =vas deferens= in its testicular part is flexuous, and\r\nis closely attached to the tunica vaginalis; it forms no ampullæ. The\r\n=cremaster externus= is well developed, and extends to about the middle\r\nof the scrotal part of the tunic.\r\n\r\nThe =vesiculæ seminales= are exceedingly large, and extend into the\r\nabdominal cavity. They are three-sided pyramidal masses, are in\r\napposition with each other medially, and cover the posterior part of the\r\nbladder and the ureters, the vasa deferentia, the body of the prostate,\r\nand the anterior part of the urethra. They are pale pink in color,\r\ndistinctly lobulated and glandular in structure, and contain large\r\nalveoli, but no central cavity. There are two excretory ducts which open\r\ninto the urethra close to the vasa deferentia; the two ducts frequently\r\nunite.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the adult boar the vesiculæ are about five to six inches (ca. 12 to\r\n  15 cm.) long, two to three inches (ca. 5 to 8 cm.) wide, and one and a\r\n  half to two inches (ca. 4 to 5 cm.) thick; they weigh about 6 to 8\r\n  ounces each.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =prostate= consists of two parts, as in the ox. The =body= is about\r\nan inch (2.5 cm.) wide, and embraces the neck of the bladder and the\r\nurethra at their junction dorsally and laterally. It is concealed by the\r\nvesiculæ seminales. The =pars disseminata= forms a layer which surrounds\r\nthe pelvic part of the urethra, and is covered by the urethral muscle.\r\n\r\nThe uterus masculinus is small.\r\n\r\nThe =bulbo-urethral= (Cowper’s) =glands= are very large and dense. They\r\nare somewhat cylindrical, and lie on either side of and upon the\r\nposterior two-thirds of the pelvic urethra. In a large boar they are\r\nabout five inches (ca. 12 cm.) in length and an inch or more (ca. 2.5 to\r\n3 cm.) in diameter. They are partially covered with a layer of striated\r\nmuscle (M. ischio-glandularis), and have a lobulated surface. Each gland\r\nhas a large excretory duct which leaves at the posterior extremity,\r\nperforates the dorsal wall of the urethra at the ischial arch, and opens\r\nin a cul-de-sac covered by a fold of mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 404.—GENITAL ORGANS OF BOAR.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Testicle; _b_, epididymis; _c_, vas deferens; _d_, spermatic\r\n    artery; _e_, vesicula seminalis reflected to show the body of the\r\n    prostate, _f_; _e′_, excretory ducts of vesiculæ; _g_,\r\n    bulbo-urethral (Cowper’s) gland; _h_, urinary bladder; _i_, urethral\r\n    muscle; _k_, bulbo-cavernosus muscle; _l_, penis; _l′_, sigmoid\r\n    flexure of penis; _l″_, spiral anterior part of penis, exposed by\r\n    slitting open prepuce; _m_, orifice of preputial pouch; _n_,\r\n    retractor penis muscle. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is to be noted that these accessory glands are very small in\r\n  animals which have been castrated early.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =penis= resembles in general that of the ox. The sigmoid flexure is,\r\nhowever, prescrotal. The anterior portion has no glans, and is spirally\r\ntwisted, especially in erection. The =urethral orifice= is slit-like and\r\nis situated ventro-laterally, close to the pointed extremity. The penis\r\nin the adult boar measures about 18 to 20 inches (ca. 45 to 50 cm.) in\r\nlength. Its muscles resemble those of the bull; the bulbo-cavernosus is\r\nvery strong but short.\r\n\r\nThe =prepuce= has a narrow orifice, around which there are a number of\r\nstiff hairs. The cavity is partially divided by a circular fold into a\r\nposterior narrow portion and a much wider anterior portion. The lining\r\nmembrane of the posterior part is papillated, and is in close contact\r\nwith the penis. In the dorsal wall of the wide part there is a circular\r\nopening which leads into a cul-de-sac, the =preputial diverticulum=.\r\nThis pouch is ovoid in form (when distended), and varies greatly in size\r\nin different subjects. It extends for the most part backward over the\r\nnarrow part of the prepuce. Its cavity is partially divided by a narrow\r\nmedian septum. It contains usually decomposing urine and macerated\r\nepithelium, which have a characteristic and very unpleasant odor.\r\nConcrements have been found in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Oehmke found that a cast of the pouch in a Yorkshire boar weighing\r\n  about 500 pounds measured 9 cm. in length, 12½ cm. in breadth, and 6\r\n  cm. in height. The opening into the prepuce will admit two fingers in\r\n  the adult, but is ordinarily closed by folds of the lining membrane.\r\n  The sac is much smaller in animals which were castrated young, and the\r\n  opening is vertical and further back; in them it is often empty or\r\n  contains only a little clear urine. The pouch is covered by a layer of\r\n  striped muscle which is mainly derived from the homologue of the\r\n  protractor of the prepuce of ruminants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =urethra= has a very long pelvic portion (ca. 15 to 18 cm. long in\r\nthe adult); it is inclosed (with the pars disseminata of the prostate)\r\nby a thick =urethral muscle=. There is a distinct =bulb= at the root of\r\nthe penis. The penile part is of small caliber, and is surrounded by\r\nerectile tissue which, however, does not extend to the extremity of the\r\npenis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     MALE GENITAL ORGANS OF THE DOG\r\n\r\nThe =scrotum= is situated about half-way between the inguinal region and\r\nthe anus. The skin covering it is pigmented and is covered sparsely with\r\nfine hairs. The raphé is not very distinct.\r\n\r\nThe =testicles= are relatively small, and have a round-oval form. The\r\nlong axis is oblique, and is directed upward and backward. The\r\nmediastinum testis is central and is well developed. The epididymis is\r\nlarge, and is closely attached along the outer part of the dorsal border\r\nof the testicle.\r\n\r\nThe =spermatic cord= and the =tunica vaginalis= are long; they cross the\r\nside of the penis very obliquely. The upper end of the tunic is\r\nsometimes closed, so that there is then no vaginal ring. The vasa\r\ndeferentia have very narrow ampullæ.\r\n\r\nThe =vesiculæ seminales= are absent; hence there are no ejaculatory\r\nducts.\r\n\r\nThe =prostate= is relatively large; it is yellowish in color, dense in\r\nstructure, and lies at the anterior border of the pubis. It is globular,\r\nand surrounds the neck of the bladder and the urethra at their junction.\r\nA faint median furrow indicates a division into two lateral lobes. The\r\ncapsule and stroma contain a large amount of unstriped muscle. The ducts\r\nare numerous. Lobules of prostatic tissue (pars disseminata) are also\r\nfound on the urethra further back. The gland is subject to much\r\nvariation in size, and is often enlarged, especially in old subjects.\r\n\r\nThe =uterus masculinus= is a very small saccule (Utriculus prostaticus),\r\noften difficult to find.\r\n\r\nThe =bulbo-urethral= (Cowper’s) =glands= are absent.\r\n\r\nThe =penis= presents several special features. In its posterior part\r\nthere are two distinct corpora cavernosa, separated by a median septum\r\npenis. In its anterior part there is a bone, the =os penis=, which in\r\nlarge dogs reaches a length of four inches (ca. 10 cm.) or more. It is\r\nregarded as a continuation forward of the corpus cavernosum. Ventrally\r\nit is grooved for the urethra; dorsally it is convex, and anteriorly it\r\nbecomes smaller and has a curved fibrous prolongation. The =glans penis=\r\nis very long, extending over the entire length of the os penis;\r\nposteriorly it forms a rounded enlargement, the =bulbus glandis=;\r\nanteriorly it is cylindrical, smaller, and pointed at the extremity.\r\nJust in front of the bulbus glandis there is a thick circular layer of\r\nglands, forming the =annulus glandularis= (Schmaltz). The two dorsal\r\nveins arise from the bulbus glandis, pass backward on the dorsum penis,\r\nand unite at the ischial arch. A small muscle (M. compressor venæ\r\ndorsalis penis) arises from the tuber ischii on either side; the two\r\nconverge on the dorsum penis near the bulbus glandis. They compress the\r\ndorsal veins, and may also tend to elevate the penis and thus assist in\r\ncopulation. The other muscles offer no features worthy of special\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe =prepuce= forms a complete sheath around the anterior part of the\r\npenis. The outer layer is ordinary integument. The inner layer has the\r\ncharacter of a glandular mucous membrane; it is thin and reddish in\r\ncolor. The penile layer is glandless. In the fundus of the præputial\r\ncavity there are numerous lymph follicles. The protractor muscles arise\r\nin the xiphoid region and decussate posteriorly around the extremity of\r\nthe penis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 405.—EXTERNAL GENITAL ORGANS OF MALE DOG, VENTRO-LATERAL VIEW OF\r\n    PREPARATION.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Scrotum; _1′_, tunica vaginalis; _2_, epididymis; _3_, vascular\r\n    part of spermatic cord; _4_, vas deferens; _5_, prepuce; _6_, glans\r\n    penis; _6′_, corpus cavernosum penis; _7_, bulbus glandis; _7′_,\r\n    contour of bulbus in erection; _8_, ischio-cavernosus muscle; _a_,\r\n    acetabulum; _b_, obturator foramen.

The other erectile bodies have been described.\r\n\r\nThe =urethral= (Wilson’s) =muscle= is very strong; it encircles the\r\nurethra and has a median raphé dorsally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE FEMALE GENITAL ORGANS\r\n\r\nThe =female genital organs= (Organa genitalia feminina) are: (1) The two\r\n=ovaries=, the essential reproductive glands, in which the ova are\r\nproduced; (2) the =uterine= or =Fallopian tubes=, which convey the ova\r\nto the uterus; (3) the =uterus=, in which the ovum develops; (4) the\r\n=vagina=, a dilatable passage through which the fœtus is expelled from\r\nthe uterus; (5) the =vulva=, the terminal segment of the genital tract,\r\nwhich serves also for the expulsion of the urine; (6) the =mammary\r\nglands=, which are glands of the skin, but are so closely associated\r\nfunctionally with the generative organs proper as to be described with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GENITAL ORGANS OF THE MARE\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE OVARIES\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 407.—LATERAL VIEW OF GENITAL ORGANS AND ADJACENT STRUCTURES OF\r\n    MARE.\r\n\r\n  The removal of the other abdominal viscera has allowed the ovaries and\r\n    uterus to sink down, whereas they are normally in contact with the\r\n    roof of the cavity in the non-pregnant subject. _1_, Left ovary;\r\n    _2_, Fallopian tube; _3_, left cornu uteri; _4_, right cornu uteri;\r\n    _5_, corpus uteri; _5′_, portio vaginalis uteri, and _5″_, os uteri,\r\n    seen through window cut in vagina; _6_, broad ligament of uterus;\r\n    _6″_, round ligament; _7_, vagina; _8_, labia vulvæ; _9_, rima\r\n    vulvæ; _9′_ superior commissure, and _9′_, inferior commissure of\r\n    vulva; _10_, constrictor vulvæ; _11_, position of vestibular bulb;\r\n    _12_, ventral wall of abdomen; _13_, left kidney; _14_, left ureter;\r\n    _15_, urinary bladder; _16_, urethra; _17_, rectum; _18_, anus;\r\n    _19_, _19′_, unpaired and paired parts of sphincter ani externus;\r\n    _20_, retractor ani cut at disappearance under sphincter; _21_,\r\n    suspensory ligament of anus; _22_, longitudinal muscular layer of\r\n    rectum; _22′_, recto-coccygeus; _23_, constrictor vaginæ; _a_,\r\n    utero-ovarian artery, with ovarian (_a′_) and uterine (_a″_)\r\n    branches; _b_, uterine artery; _c_, umbilical artery; _d_, ischium;\r\n    _e_, pubis; _f_, ilium. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =ovaries= (Ovaria) of the mare are bean-shaped, and are much smaller\r\nthan the testicles. Their size varies much in different subjects, and\r\nthey are normally larger in young than in old animals; one ovary is\r\noften larger than the other. They are about three inches (ca. 7 to 8\r\ncm.) long and an inch to an inch and a half (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) thick. The\r\nweight is about two and a half to three ounces (ca. 70 to 80 grams).\r\n\r\nEach presents for description two surfaces, two borders, and two\r\nextremities or poles. The =surfaces= are termed internal and external\r\n(Facies medialis, lateralis); they are both smooth and rounded.[149] The\r\n=attached= or =mesovarial border= (Margo mesovaricus) is convex. It is\r\ninclosed in a part of the broad ligament termed the mesovarium; the\r\nvessels and nerves reach the gland at this border. The =free border=\r\n(Margo liber) is marked by a notch which leads into a depression, the\r\n=ovulation fossa=. The =tubal= or =anterior extremity= (Extremitas\r\ntubaria) is rounded, and is related to the fimbriated end of the uterine\r\nor Fallopian tube. The =uterine= or =posterior extremity= (Extremitas\r\nuterina) is also round, and is connected with the horn of the uterus by\r\nthe ovarian ligament.\r\n\r\nThe ovaries are situated in the sublumbar region of the abdominal\r\ncavity, about a handbreadth behind the corresponding kidney. They are in\r\ncontact with the lumbar wall of the abdomen, and are commonly about two\r\nor three inches (ca. 5 to 7.5 cm.) from the median plane. The distance\r\nfrom the ovaries to the vulvar orifice is about twenty inches (ca. 50\r\ncm.) in a mare of medium size. The attached (mesovarial) border is\r\ncommonly directed toward the median plane, the free border laterally and\r\nsomewhat ventrally.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The position of the ovaries is not constant, but is subject to less\r\n  variation than might be expected from their mode of attachment. The\r\n  normal variations in the non-pregnant state are chiefly in a\r\n  transverse direction, and do not usually exceed two or three inches\r\n  (ca. 5 to 7 cm.). It is not at all rare to find the ovary deflected\r\n  medially, so that the external surface faces ventrally. In the\r\n  longitudinal direction little variation appears to occur. The right\r\n  ovary is usually about four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.), and the\r\n  left one about three or four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.), behind the\r\n  corresponding kidney. Thus they lie about in a transverse plane\r\n  tangent to the external angles of the ilia, i. e., through the fifth\r\n  lumbar vertebra. They may be about two inches (ca. 5 cm.) from the\r\n  extremity of the corresponding cornu of the uterus or in contact with\r\n  it. The right ovary commonly lies a little (ca. 2.5 cm.) further\r\n  forward than the left one. Except during pregnancy, they are normally\r\n  in contact with the lumbar abdominal wall, and do not hang down among\r\n  the adjacent viscera.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 408.—RIGHT OVARY OF MARE, WITH ADJACENT STRUCTURES.\r\n\r\n  The extremity of the cornu uteri is opened. _1_, Ovary; _2_, Fallopian\r\n    tube, with its ostium abdominale (_2′_), fimbriæ (_2″_), and ostium\r\n    uterinum (_2‴_); _3_, cornu uteri, with its mucous lining (_3′_);\r\n    _4_, ovarian ligament; _4′_, mesosalpinx. (After Ellenberger, in\r\n    Leisering’s Atlas, reduced.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ovary is attached to the sublumbar region by the anterior part of\r\nthe broad ligament; this part of the ligament, the =mesovarium=, is\r\nabout three or four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) wide, measured from the\r\novary directly to the parietal attachment. The uterine or posterior\r\nextremity of the ovary, is connected with the extremity of the cornu of\r\nthe uterus by the =ovarian ligament= (Ligamentum ovarii proprium); this\r\nis a band of unstriped muscle inclosed between the layers of the broad\r\nligament.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The greater part of the surface of the ovary has a covering\r\nof peritoneum. The peritoneal investment is absent at the attached\r\nborder where the vessels and nerves enter; this area is termed the\r\n=hilus=. The ovulation fossa is covered by a layer of columnar cells, a\r\nremnant of the primitive =germinal epithelium=. The =stroma= of the\r\novary (Stroma ovarii) is a network of connective tissue and unstriped\r\nmuscular fibers. In the deeper or medullary portion of the stroma (Zona\r\nvasculosa) the meshes are largely occupied by the numerous\r\nblood-vessels. In the peripheral or cortical portion (Zona\r\nparenchymatosa) are numerous =ova= (Ovula) in various stages of\r\ndevelopment. The immature ova are surrounded by follicle cells; those\r\nmore advanced in development are inclosed also by a condensation of the\r\nstroma termed the =theca folliculi=; within the theca is a quantity of\r\nfluid, the =liquor folliculi=. These constitute the =Graafian follicles=\r\n(Folliculi oöphori), which enlarge as they mature, becoming visible to\r\nthe naked eye as vesicles with a diameter of a centimeter or more. When\r\nfully developed, the follicles are superficially situated, and often\r\nproject slightly from the surface of the ovary. At intervals follicles\r\nrupture and their contents escape. This process, which sets free the\r\novum, is termed =ovulation=; it takes place in the mare only at the\r\novulation fossa, and occurs during the periods of œstrum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 409.—SCHEMATIC REPRESENTATION OF CHANGES IN OVARY OF MARE FROM\r\n    FŒTAL TO ADULT STATE. (After Born.)\r\n\r\n  The changes affect chiefly the free border (upper in figure) and the\r\n    extent and form of the area covered by germinal epithelium (_4_).\r\n    _1_, Peritoneum (broad ligament); _2_, ligament of ovary; _3_,\r\n    fimbria of Fallopian tube; _4_, germinal epithelium; _5_, vessels,\r\n    which reach the ovary at the attached border (_6_). The latter\r\n    represents the hilus, while the deep depression at the free border\r\n    is the ovulation fossa. (Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  After rupture of a follicle its cavity is partly occupied by a\r\n  blood-clot, constituting what may be termed a =corpus rubrum=. By\r\n  proliferation and enlargement and fatty changes, the follicle cells\r\n  are transformed into lutein cells, forming a yellow mass known as a\r\n  =corpus luteum=. If impregnation takes place, the accompanying\r\n  increase in vascularity of the organs may cause the corpus luteum to\r\n  reach a large size; if impregnation does not occur, it is much\r\n  smaller, and is sooner replaced by scar tissue, the =corpus albicans=.\r\n\r\n  In the young foal the ovaries are large and oval in form. The free\r\n  border is convex and is covered by germinal epithelium, which extends\r\n  over part of the surfaces also. This area is distinguishable by its\r\n  dull gray appearance from the peritoneal surface, which has the usual\r\n  smooth glistening character. As growth proceeds the ovary gradually\r\n  becomes bent until it assumes its definitive curved shape. The\r\n  germinal epithelium is then limited to the ovulation fossa. The ovary\r\n  migrates somewhat during development from its primitive position,\r\n  which is the same as that of the testicle.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn old animals the ovaries commonly consist largely of fibrous tissue,\r\nin which there are often cysts of various sizes. The ova, present in\r\nenormous number at birth, have then been extruded, or destroyed by\r\nphagocytic action or degeneration.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =arteries= of the ovary are derived from the\r\n=ovarian artery=. The artery is relatively large and is flexuous; it\r\nreaches the attached border of the ovary by passing between the layers\r\nof the mesovarium. The veins are large and numerous. They form a plexus\r\nsomewhat like that of the spermatic cord. The =lymph vessels= pass to\r\nthe lumbar glands. The =nerves= are derived from the sympathetic system\r\nthrough the renal and aortic plexuses. They accompany the arterial\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE UTERINE OR FALLOPIAN TUBES\r\n\r\nThe =uterine= or =Fallopian tubes= (Tubæ uterinæ) act as excretory ducts\r\nof the ovaries, since they convey the ova from the reproductive glands\r\nto the uterus. They are not, however, in direct continuity with the\r\nglands, but rather partly in contiguity with, and partly attached to,\r\nthem.[150] They are two flexuous tubes, about ten to twelve inches (ca.\r\n25 to 30 cm.) long, which extend from the extremities of the uterine\r\ncornua to the ovaries. Each is inclosed in a peritoneal fold, derived\r\nfrom the external layer of the broad ligament, and termed the\r\n=mesosalpinx=. This largely covers the outer aspect of the ovary, and\r\nforms with it and the broad ligament a pouch called the =bursa ovarica=.\r\nThe =uterine extremity= of the tube communicates with the cavity of the\r\ncornu by a minute orifice, the =ostium uterinum=. The =ovarian= or\r\n=fimbriated extremity= is expanded into a funnel-shaped =infundibulum=.\r\nThe margin of the latter is slit into irregular processes or =fimbriæ=,\r\nsome of which, the =fimbriæ ovaricæ=, are attached in the ovulation\r\nfossa. In the center of the fimbriated extremity is a small opening, the\r\n=ostium abdominale=, by which the tube communicates with the peritoneal\r\ncavity. The tube appears normally to be applied to the ovary, so that\r\nthe extruded ova pass into it and are conveyed to the uterus.[151]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pedunculated cysts, the hydatids of =Morgagni=, are often found on one\r\n  or more of the fimbriæ. In the mesosalpinx are blind flexuous tubules,\r\n  which constitute the =paroöphoron=, a remnant of the Wolffian body.\r\n  They are most evident in the young adult, and tend to disappear with\r\n  increasing age. Not uncommonly they give rise to cysts.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The tube is covered externally by a =serous coat= formed by\r\nthe mesosalpinx. The serous membrane is continued on the fimbriæ, and\r\nmeets the mucous lining on them. The =fibrous coat= or adventitia is\r\ncontinuous with the fibrous lamina of the broad ligament. The =muscular\r\ncoat= consists chiefly of circular fibers, although longitudinal fibers\r\noccur externally. The =mucous coat= is thin and is much plicated. The\r\nfolds (Plicæ tubariæ) are chiefly longitudinal, but in the wide part of\r\nthe tube (Ampullæ tubæ) they are very complex, so that on cross-sections\r\nthe spaces between the folds may be mistaken for branched tubular\r\nglands. The folds are continued on to the fimbriæ. The =epithelium= is a\r\nsingle layer of columnar ciliated cells, the cilia producing a current\r\ndirected toward the uterus. At the fimbriated extremity this epithelium\r\npasses gradually into the squamous type of the serous coat.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =arteries= are derived from the =utero-ovarian\r\nartery=. The =veins= are satellites of the arteries. The =lymphatics=\r\npass with the ovarian vessels to the lumbar glands. The nerves have a\r\nsimilar origin to those of the ovary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE UTERUS\r\n\r\nThe =uterus= is a hollow muscular organ, which receives the Fallopian\r\ntubes anteriorly and opens into the vagina posteriorly. It is situated\r\nchiefly in the abdominal cavity, but extends a short distance into the\r\npelvic cavity. It is attached to the lumbar wall of the abdomen and the\r\nlateral walls of the pelvic cavity by two folds of peritoneum termed the\r\nbroad ligaments. It consists of two cornua or horns, the body, and the\r\nneck.\r\n\r\nThe =cornua= or =horns= of the uterus (Cornua uteri) are situated\r\nentirely in the abdomen. They appear to vary considerably in position;\r\ncommonly they are pressed up against the sublumbar muscles by the\r\nintestine (left portions of large colon, small colon, and small\r\nintestine). They are cylindrical, and are about ten inches (ca. 25 cm.)\r\nin length. The anterior extremity of each forms a blunt point which\r\nreceives the Fallopian tube. Posteriorly they increase somewhat in\r\ncaliber, converge, and unite with the body. The =dorsal= (or attached)\r\n=border= is slightly concave and is attached to the broad ligament. The\r\n=ventral border= is convex and free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 410.—GENITAL ORGANS OF MARE, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The left cornu and adjacent part of the body of the uterus and the\r\n    vagina and vulva are opened up. _1_, Ovary; _2_, Fallopian tube,\r\n    with _2′_, its fimbriated end; _3_, cavity of corpus uteri; _4_,\r\n    cavity of left cornu; _5_, right cornu, with _5′_, its communication\r\n    with the body; _6_, portio vaginalis uteri; _6′_, os uteri; _7_,\r\n    broad ligament of uterus; _8_, ligament of ovary; _9_, vagina; _10_,\r\n    vulva; _10′_, glandulæ vestibulares majores; _10″_, glandulæ\r\n    vestibulares minores; _11_, transverse fold; _12_, external urethral\r\n    opening; _13_, _13′_, labia vulvæ; _14_, glans clitoridis; _14′_,\r\n    junction of crura to form corpus clitoridis indicated by dotted\r\n    lines; _15_, urinary bladder; _a_, utero-ovarian artery with ovarian\r\n    (_a′_) and uterine (_a″_) branches; _b_, uterine artery. (After\r\n    Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  When a soft uterus is distended, the cornua are strongly curved, but\r\n  this does not represent the natural form. When fixed _in situ_ the\r\n  horns are either slightly curved or nearly straight. The two horns are\r\n  commonly unsymmetrical in length and diameter in mares which have\r\n  borne young.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =body= of the uterus (Corpus uteri) is situated partly in the\r\nabdomen, partly in the pelvic cavity. It is cylindrical, but\r\nconsiderably flattened dorso-ventrally, so that in cross-section it is\r\nelliptical. Its average length is about six inches (15 cm.), and its\r\ndiameter, when moderately distended, about four inches (10 cm.). Its\r\n=dorsal surface= (Facies rectalis) is related to the small colon and\r\nrectum. Its =ventral surface= (Facies vesicalis) is in contact with the\r\nbladder, and has inconstant relations with various parts of the\r\nintestine. The term =fundus uteri= is applied to the anterior wide part\r\nfrom which the cornua diverge.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The position of the body of the uterus is variable, especially in\r\n  regard to its anterior part. It is often pressed up against the\r\n  rectum, and may be deflected to either side—most frequently to the\r\n  left—by the pelvic flexure of the colon or coils of the small colon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =cervix= or =neck= of the uterus (Cervix uteri) is the constricted\r\nposterior part which joins the vagina. Part of it (Portio vaginalis\r\nuteri) projects into the cavity of the vagina; it is therefore not\r\nvisible externally, but may be felt through the vaginal wall. It is\r\nabout two inches (5 cm.) in length, and an inch and a half (3.5 to 4\r\ncm.) in diameter.\r\n\r\n=Attachments.=—The body and cornua are attached to the abdominal and\r\npelvic walls by two extensive peritoneal folds, the =broad ligaments=\r\n(Ligamenta lata). These extend on either side from the sublumbar region\r\nand the lateral pelvic walls to the dorsal border of the cornua and the\r\nlateral margins of the body of the uterus. They contain the vessels and\r\nnerves of the uterus and ovaries, connective tissue, and unstriped\r\nmuscular fibers. The ureters are situated along their parietal margins.\r\nThe outer layer of each forms a fold, the =round ligament= of the uterus\r\n(Ligamentum teres uteri), which blends with the parietal peritoneum over\r\nthe internal inguinal ring; its anterior extremity is situated above the\r\nextremity of the cornu and is rounded and free. It contains muscular\r\ntissue, vessels, and nerves, and is the homologue of the gubernaculum\r\ntestis. The anterior part of the neck is continuous with the vagina, and\r\nthus has a more fixed position than the rest of the organ.\r\n\r\n=The cavity= of the uterus (Cavum uteri) is largely obliterated in the\r\nnon-pregnant state by the contraction of the wall and by folds of the\r\nmucous lining. At the extremity of each cornu it communicates by a\r\nminute opening with the Fallopian tube. The cavity of the neck is termed\r\nthe =cervical canal= (Canalis cervicis); it is closed ordinarily by\r\nmucous folds and a plug of mucus. It opens into the vagina by the =os\r\nuteri externum=, and into the body by the =os uteri internum=.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The wall of the uterus consists of three coats—an external\r\nserous, a middle muscular, and an internal mucous. The =serous coat=\r\n(Perimetrium) is, for the most part, closely adherent to the muscular\r\ncoat. It is continuous with the broad ligaments. The =muscular coat=\r\nconsists essentially of two layers, a thin external stratum of\r\nlongitudinal fibers, and a thick layer of circular fibers. Between these\r\nis a very vascular layer (Stratum vasculare) of connective tissue with\r\ncircular and oblique muscular fibers in it. The circular coat is very\r\nthick in the neck, where it forms a =sphincter= half an inch or more\r\n(ca. 1.5 cm.) in thickness. The =mucous membrane= rests directly on the\r\nmuscular coat. It is thick, and is covered by columnar epithelium. It\r\ncontains numerous long tubular =uterine glands= (Glandulæ uterinæ). It\r\nis brownish-red in color, except in the neck, where it is pale.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The chief =arteries= are the =uterine= and the\r\n=uterine branch= of the =utero-ovarian=, which have a flexuous course in\r\nthe broad ligaments; there is also a branch from the =internal pudic=\r\nartery. The =veins= form pampiniform plexuses and accompany the\r\narteries. The =lymphatics= are numerous and go to the internal iliac and\r\nlumbar glands. The =nerves= are derived from the sympathetic through the\r\nuterine and pelvic plexuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The foregoing statements refer to the non-gravid uterus. In the\r\n  pregnant state it undergoes important changes in size, position, and\r\n  structure. The increase in size affects chiefly the gravid cornu\r\n  (except in the case of twins) and the body. The cornu attains a length\r\n  of about two and a half to three feet (ca. 80 to 90 cm.), and a\r\n  corresponding diameter; in this process it extends much beyond the\r\n  ovary, and the broad ligament. The gravid uterus is entirely abdominal\r\n  in position, and extends along the ventral wall, chiefly to the left\r\n  of the median plane. It weighs about nine pounds (ca. 4 kg.),\r\n  according to Ellenberger. The broad ligaments increase greatly in size\r\n  and contain more muscular tissue. The vessels are greatly enlarged and\r\n  form new branches. The muscular coat, in spite of the increase in size\r\n  and number of the fibers, is somewhat thinner, except in the neck. The\r\n  mucous membrane is thicker and more vascular; the epithelium becomes\r\n  non-ciliated and stratified.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE VAGINA\r\n\r\nThe =vagina= is the passage which extends horizontally through the\r\npelvic cavity from the neck of the uterus to the vulva. It is tubular,\r\nis about six to eight inches (ca. 15 to 20 cm.) in length, and, when\r\nslightly distended, about four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) in\r\ndiameter. Its dilatability appears to be limited only by the pelvic\r\nwall. There is no external line of demarcation between the vagina and\r\nthe uterus or the vulva.\r\n\r\nIt is related dorsally to the rectum, ventrally to the bladder and\r\nurethra, and laterally to the pelvic wall. The recto-genital pouch of\r\nthe peritoneum extends between the vagina and rectum for a distance of\r\nabout two inches (5 cm.), and ventrally the vesico-genital pouch passes\r\nbackward somewhat less between the vagina and bladder. Thus most of the\r\nvagina is retroperitoneal and is surrounded by a quantity of loose\r\nconnective tissue, a venous plexus, and a variable amount of fat.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—With the exception of the short peritoneal part, as\r\nindicated above, the proper wall of the vagina is composed of muscular\r\nand mucous coats. The =muscular coat= is composed of a thin layer of\r\nlongitudinal fibers, and a thicker layer of circular fibers; it contains\r\nalso many elastic fibers. The =mucous coat= is highly elastic, and is\r\ncovered with a stratified epithelium. It has no glands.\r\n\r\nUnder usual conditions the cavity is practically obliterated by\r\napposition of the walls, so that the lumen is a transverse slit; this\r\ncondition is pronounced when the ampulla of the rectum is full. The\r\nanterior end of the vagina is largely occupied by the intravaginal part\r\nof the neck of the uterus, so that the cavity is here reduced to an\r\nannular recess termed the =fornix vaginæ=. The posterior part is\r\ndirectly continuous with the vulva without any line of demarcation\r\nexcept the valvular fold, which covers the external urethral orifice; in\r\nvery young subjects this fold is continued on either side, forming the\r\n=hymen=, which narrows the entrance to the vagina (Introitus\r\nvaginæ).[152]\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The blood-supply is derived from the branches of\r\nthe =internal pudic arteries=. The =veins= form a plexus which is\r\ndrained by the =internal pudic veins=. The =lymphatics= pass to the\r\ninternal iliac lymph glands. The =nerves= are derived from the\r\nsympathetic through the pelvic plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE VULVA\r\n\r\nThe =vulva= or =urogenital sinus= is the terminal part of the genital\r\ntract.[153] It is continuous in front with the vagina, and opens\r\nexternally at the vulvar cleft below the anus. There is no external line\r\nof demarcation between the vagina and vulva. The tube is about five\r\ninches (ca. 12 cm.) in length, measured from the external urethral\r\norifice to the inferior commissure; dorsally it is considerably shorter.\r\nIt is related dorsally to the rectum and anus, ventrally to the pelvic\r\nfloor, and laterally to the sacro-sciatic ligament, the semimembranosus\r\nmuscle, and the internal pudic artery. The external orifice or =vulvar\r\ncleft= (Rima vulvæ) has the form of a vertical slit, about four to six\r\ninches (ca. 10 to 15 cm.) high, and is margined by two prominent rounded\r\nfolds, the labia. The =labia= of the vulva (Labia vulvæ) meet above at\r\nan acute angle, forming the =superior commissure= (Commissura dorsalis),\r\nwhich is about two inches (ca. 5 cm.) below the anus. Below they unite\r\nto form the thick rounded =inferior commissure= (Commissura ventralis),\r\nwhich lies about two inches (ca. 5 cm.) behind and below the ischial\r\narch. When the labia are drawn apart, a rounded body, about an inch (ca.\r\n2.5 cm.) wide, is seen in the inferior commissure; this is the =glans\r\nclitoridis=, the homologue of the glans penis. Overlying it is a thin\r\nfold, the =prepuce= of the clitoris (Præputium clitoridis). At the\r\nanterior extremity of the ventral wall of the vulva, _i. e._, about four\r\nor five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) from the inferior commissure, is the\r\n=external urethral orifice= or meatus urinarius (Orificium urethræ\r\nexternum). It readily admits the finger and is very dilatable. It is\r\ncovered by a fold of mucous membrane, the free edge of which is directed\r\nbackward.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The =labia= are covered by thin, pigmented, smooth skin,\r\nwhich is richly supplied with sebaceous and sweat glands. This is\r\ncontinuous at a distance of about half an inch (ca. 1 to 1.5 cm.) from\r\nthe free edge with a thin glandless mucous membrane. Between these is a\r\nlayer of striped muscle, the =constrictor vulvæ=; this fuses above with\r\nthe sphincter ani, and embraces the clitoris below, spreading out\r\nlaterally at the inferior commissure. It constricts the vulvar orifice\r\nand elevates the clitoris. The =constrictor vestibuli= muscle embraces\r\nthe vulva in front of the preceding; it is joined on either side by a\r\nband of unstriped muscle which arises from the first and second\r\ncoccygeal vertebræ, and is homologous with the proximal part of the\r\nretractor penis. It constricts the vulva. Under this muscle in the\r\nlateral wall is a flattened, oval body, the =bulbus vestibuli= (Fig.\r\n453); this is an erectile structure, homologous with the corpus\r\nspongiosum urethræ of the male. It is about two and a half to three\r\ninches (ca. 6 to 8 cm.) long, and an inch or more (ca. 3 cm.) wide. It\r\nconsists of a venous network inclosed in a fibrous capsule, and is\r\nsupplied with blood by a large branch of the internal pudic artery. The\r\n=mucous membrane= of the vulva is reddish in color, and forms\r\nlongitudinal and transverse folds. It presents ventrally two linear\r\nseries of small papillæ which converge toward the inferior commissure;\r\nthese mark the orifices of the ducts of the =glandulæ vestibulares\r\nminores=. On either side of the dorsal wall is a group of eight to ten\r\nlarger prominences on which the ducts of the =glandulæ vestibulares\r\nmajores= (of Bartholin) open.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Quite exceptionally there may be found on either side of the urethral\r\n  orifice the opening of the canals of Gartner (Ductus epoöphori\r\n  longitudinales).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =clitoris= is the homologue of the penis. It arises from the ischial\r\narch by two crura, which unite to form a =body= as large as one’s little\r\nfinger. This projects backward into the inferior commissure of the\r\nvulva, capped by a small rounded =glans=. The organ is composed of\r\nerectile tissue similar to the corpus cavernosum penis. The\r\n=ischio-cavernosus= (or erector clitoridis) is a very feeble muscle\r\nwhich depresses the clitoris. The veins of the clitoris communicate by\r\nan intermediate plexus on either side with the bulbus vestibuli.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FEMALE URETHRA\r\n\r\nThe female =urethra= (Urethra feminina) represents only that part of the\r\ncanal of the male which lies between the internal urethral orifice and\r\nthe openings of the ejaculatory ducts. Its length is about two inches (5\r\ncm.), and its lumen is sufficient to admit of the introduction of the\r\nfinger; it is, however, capable of remarkable dilatation if sufficient\r\ncare and patience are exercised in the process. It lies centrally on the\r\npelvic floor, and is related and attached dorsally to the vagina.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The intrinsic =muscular coat= consists of longitudinal and\r\ncircular layers of unstriped fibers. Between these is a layer of areolar\r\ntissue which contains a rich =venous plexus=. The =mucous membrane= is\r\nthrown into longitudinal folds when the canal is closed; it is highly\r\nelastic, and is covered with stratified epithelium.\r\n\r\nThe =urethral muscle= (M. compressor urethræ) embraces the urethra and\r\nis continued backward for some distance under the constrictor vestibuli.\r\nIt is covered by a fibro-elastic membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE MAMMARY GLANDS\r\n\r\nThe =mammary glands= (Glandulæ lactiferæ) are modified cutaneous glands\r\nwhich are so closely associated functionally with the genital organs as\r\nto be considered accessory to them.\r\n\r\nIn the mare they are two in number, and are placed on either side of the\r\nmedian plane in the inguinal region. Each gland has the form of a short\r\ncone, much compressed transversely, and having a flat inner surface. It\r\nconsists of the glandular mass or body of the gland (Corpus mammæ) and\r\nthe =teat= or =nipple= (Papilla mammæ). The base is related to the\r\nabdominal wall, to which it is attached by areolar tissue, which\r\ncontains a venous plexus, the superficial inguinal lymph glands, and a\r\nvariable amount of fat. The apex is constituted by the teat, which is\r\nalso flattened transversely and varies in length from one to two inches\r\n(ca. 2.5 to 5 cm.). Between the bases of the teats is the intermammary\r\ngroove. On the apex of each teat two or three small orifices are placed\r\nclose together; these are the openings of the lactiferous ducts.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The =skin= over the glands is thin, pigmented, chiefly\r\nhairless, and supplied with numerous large sebaceous and sweat glands.\r\nUnder this are two layers of =fascia= except on the teats. The\r\nsuperficial fascia presents no special features. The deep fascia\r\nconsists of two laminæ detached from the abdominal tunic which descend\r\non either side of the median plane, forming a =septum= between the two\r\nglands, and constituting their ligamentum suspensorium.\r\n\r\n\r\n  These laminæ are separated by a layer of areolar tissue, so that it is\r\n  possible to remove one gland if diseased by careful dissection between\r\n  the layers of the septum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =gland substance= or =parenchyma= is pinkish gray in color, and of\r\nfirmer consistence than the fat which is found around and within the\r\ngland. It is inclosed by a fibro-elastic capsule which sends inward\r\nnumerous trabeculæ; these form the =interstitial tissue=, and divide the\r\ngland into =lobes= and =lobules=. In the latter are the secretory\r\n=tubules= and =alveoli=, which unite to form the larger =ducts=. Each\r\nlobe has a duct, which opens at the base of the teat into a space called\r\nthe =lactiferous sinus= (Sinus lactiferus); this is lined with mucous\r\nmembrane, and from it two (or three) =lactiferous ducts= (Ductus\r\nlactiferi) pass through the extremity of the nipple. These ducts are\r\nlined with a non-glandular mucous membrane, which is covered with\r\nstratified squamous epithelium. They are surrounded by unstriped\r\nmuscular tissue, the bulk of the fibers being arranged in a circular\r\nmanner to form a =sphincter=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The size and form of the mammary glands are subject to much variation.\r\n  In the young subject, before pregnancy, they are small and contain\r\n  little gland tissue. During the latter part of gestation, and\r\n  especially during lactation, they increase greatly in size, and the\r\n  gland tissue is highly developed. After lactation the secretory\r\n  structures undergo marked involution, and the gland is much reduced in\r\n  size. The relative amounts of gland substance and interstitial tissue\r\n  vary greatly; in some cases a gland of considerable size contains\r\n  little secretory tissue and is consequently functionally deficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =arteries= are derived from the =external\r\npudic artery=, which enters the gland at the posterior part of its base.\r\nThe =veins= form a plexus on either side of the base of the gland, which\r\nis drained by the =external pudic vein= chiefly. The =lymphatics= are\r\nnumerous and pass chiefly to the superficial inguinal (or supramammary)\r\nlymph glands. The =nerves= are derived from the =inguinal nerves= and\r\nthe =posterior mesenteric plexus= of the sympathetic system.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GENITAL ORGANS OF THE COW\r\n\r\nThe =ovaries= of the cow are much smaller than those of the mare,\r\nmeasuring usually about one to one and a half inches (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) in\r\nlength, and a little less than an inch (ca. 2 cm.) in thickness in their\r\nlargest part. They are oval in form, pointed at the uterine end, and\r\nhave no ovulation fossa. They are situated usually a little above the\r\nmiddle of the lateral margin of the pelvic inlet in the non-pregnant\r\nsubject, but may be found a little further forward. They are thus about\r\n16 to 18 inches (ca. 40 to 45 cm.) from the vulva in a cow of medium\r\nsize. The greater part of the surface of the gland is covered with\r\ngerminal epithelium, the peritoneal epithelium being limited to a narrow\r\nzone along the attached border. Follicles of various sizes are often\r\nseen projecting from the surface, as well as corpora lutea; a corpus\r\nluteum verum has a pronounced yellow color, and may reach a width of\r\nhalf an inch or more (ca. 1 to 1.5 cm.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 411.—OVARY OF COW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Broad ligament of uterus; _2_, ligament of ovary; _3_, fimbria\r\n    ovarica; _4_, attachment of broad ligament; _5_, surface of ovary\r\n    covered with germinal epithelium; _6_, corpora lutea; _7_, Graafian\r\n    follicle.

The junction with the cornu of the uterus is not so abrupt as\r\nin the mare, since the extremities of the horns are pointed. The uterine\r\norifice of the tube is rather large and funnel-shaped. The fimbriæ are\r\nnot so extensive as in the mare.\r\n\r\nThe =uterus= lies almost entirely within the abdominal cavity in the\r\nadult. The =body= is only about one inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.) in length,\r\nalthough externally it appears to be much longer. This false impression\r\nis due to the fact that the posterior parts of the cornua are united by\r\nconnective and muscular tissue and have a common peritoneal covering.\r\nThe =cornua= are, therefore, really longer than they appear externally.\r\nThey taper gradually toward the free end, so that the junction with the\r\nFallopian tubes is not abrupt, as in the mare. The free part of the horn\r\ncurves at first downward, forward, and outward, and then turns upward,\r\nforming a spiral coil. The =cervix= is about four or five inches (ca. 8\r\nto 10 cm.) long; its wall is remarkably dense, and may be nearly an inch\r\n(ca. 2 cm.) in thickness. Its lumen, the =cervical canal=, is spiral,\r\nand is ordinarily tightly closed and very difficult to dilate. The\r\n=muscular coat= of the uterus is thicker than in the mare. It consists\r\nof an external longitudinal layer and two circular strata. The inner\r\ncircular layer is about a fourth of an inch (ca. 6 mm.) thick in the\r\ncervix. The other layers are continued in the vagina. The =mucous\r\nmembrane= of the horns and body presents as a characteristic feature the\r\n=uterine cotyledons= (Cotyledones uterinæ). These are oval prominences,\r\nabout a hundred in number, which are either irregularly scattered over\r\nthe surface or arranged in rows of about a dozen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the non-gravid uterus they average about ½ to ¾ inch (ca. 15 to 18\r\n  mm.) in length, ⅓ inch (ca. 8 mm.) in width, and ⅛ inch (ca. 2 to 4\r\n  mm.) in thickness. During pregnancy they become greatly enlarged and\r\n  pedunculated. The larger ones then measure about 4 to 5 inches (10 to\r\n  12 cm.) in length, 1 to 1½ inches (3 to 4 cm.) in width, and 1 inch (2\r\n  to 2.5 cm.) in thickness. The deep face has a hilus at which the\r\n  vessels enter. The rest of the surface has a spongy appearance, due to\r\n  numerous crypts which receive the villi of the chorion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =uterine glands= are long and branched. The mucous membrane of the\r\ncervix is pale and forms numerous folds. The latter are arranged in\r\nseveral series which obliterate the lumen. At the external orifice (os\r\nuteri) the folds (Plicæ palmatæ) form rounded prominences arranged\r\ncircularly, which project into the cavity of the vagina. There are no\r\nglands in the cervix, but a thick mucus is secreted by goblet cells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 413.—UTERINE COTYLEDON OF COW.\r\n\r\n  The figure represents a cotyledon of medium size. (After Ellenberger,\r\n    in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 414.—GENITAL ORGANS OF COW, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The right uterine cornu and the vagina and vulva are opened up: _1_,\r\n    Labium vulvæ; _2_, ventral commissure; _3_, glans clitoridis; _4_,\r\n    glandula vestibularis major, exposed by slit in mucous membrane;\r\n    _5_, opening of duct of preceding; _6_, suburethral diverticulum;\r\n    _7_, external urethral opening; _8_, openings of canals of Gartner;\r\n    _9_, os uteri; _10_, corpus uteri; _11_, cornu uteri; _12_,\r\n    cotyledons; _13_, Fallopian tube; _14_, ostium abdominale tubæ;\r\n    _15_, ovary (From Leisering’s Atlas, reduced.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =broad ligaments= are not attached in the sublumbar region as in the\r\nmare, but to the upper part of the flanks, about a handbreadth below the\r\nlevel of the external angle of the ilium. They contain a conspicuous\r\namount of unstriped muscle. The =round ligaments= are well developed,\r\nand can be traced distinctly to the vicinity of the internal inguinal\r\nring.\r\n\r\nThe =vagina= is somewhat longer and more roomy than that of the mare;\r\nits wall is also thicker. Its average length in the non-pregnant animal\r\nis about eight inches (ca. 20 cm.); but in the pregnant cow the length\r\nincreases to twelve inches (30 cm.) or more. The recto-genital pouch of\r\nperitoneum extends backward about five inches (ca. 12 cm.) on the dorsal\r\nsurface, while ventrally the serous coat only extends backward about two\r\ninches (ca. 5 cm.).\r\n\r\n\r\n  This gives ample space dorsally for the incision of the fornix vaginæ\r\n  in oöphorectomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ventral wall of the vagina, between the muscular and mucous\r\ncoats, there are frequently present the two =canals of Gartner= (Ductus\r\nepoöphori longitudinales). When well developed they may attain the\r\ndiameter of a goose quill, and may be traced forward to the anterior\r\npart of the vagina or even further. They open posteriorly near the\r\nexternal urethral orifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n  These tubes are remnants of the Wolffian ducts, and, like other fœtal\r\n  vestiges, are very variable. Röder states that the right canal was\r\n  absent in over 52 per cent., the left in only 22 per cent., of the\r\n  cows examined by him. In some cases they may be traced in the broad\r\n  ligaments for a variable distance toward the ovary. They are of\r\n  clinical interest in that cysts frequently form along their course.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 415.—DIAGRAMMATIC SAGITTAL SECTION OF PART OF UROGENITAL TRACT OF\r\n    COW, SHOWING SUBURETHRAL DIVERTICULUM.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =vulva= has thick wrinkled labia, and both commissures are acute;\r\nthe lower one is pointed, and has on it a number of long hairs; it lies\r\nabout two inches (5 cm.) behind, and about the same distance below, the\r\nlevel of the ischial arch. The =glans clitoridis= is small; the =crura=\r\nare about four inches (ca. 10 cm.) long and are flexuous. The =external\r\nurethral orifice= or meatus urinarius is four or five inches (10 to 12\r\ncm.) from the ventral commissure. Beneath it is a blind pouch, the\r\n=suburethral diverticulum=, which is more than an inch (ca. 3 to 4 cm.)\r\nlong, and readily admits the end of a finger.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The form and position of this pouch should be carefully noted on\r\n  account of the difficulty it causes in catheterizing the bladder. If\r\n  the catheter is passed along the ventral wall of the vulva (as in the\r\n  mare), it will always enter the pouch instead of the urethra.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =glandulæ vestibulares majores= (or glands of Bartholin) are\r\nsituated on the lateral walls of the vulva, under the constrictor vulvæ.\r\nThey are little over an inch (ca. 3 cm.) long and about half an inch\r\n(ca. 1.5 cm.) in width. Each has a single duct which opens about an inch\r\nand a half (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) lateral to and behind the external urethral\r\norifice.\r\n\r\nThe =urethra= of the cow is about four inches (10 cm.) in length; it is\r\nnarrower and much less dilatable than that of the mare. It is fused\r\ndorsally with the wall of the vagina, while laterally and ventrally it\r\nis covered by the constrictor vaginæ muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =mammary glands=, normally two in number, are popularly termed the\r\nudder. They are very much larger than in the mare, and the body of each\r\nis somewhat ellipsoidal in form, but flattened transversely. The =base=\r\n(or dorsal surface) of each gland is slightly concave and slopes\r\nobliquely downward and forward in adaptation to the abdominal wall, to\r\nwhich it is adherent; posteriorly it is in relation to the large\r\nsupramammary lymph glands and a quantity of fat. The inner surface is\r\nflat, and is separated from the other gland by a well-developed double\r\nseptum. The outer surface is convex. Four well-developed teats are\r\npresent; they average about three inches (ca. 7 to 8 cm.) in length. It\r\nis customary to consider the udder to consist of four “quarters.” There\r\nis no septum nor visible division between the two quarters of the same\r\nside, but, on the other hand, injections of fluids of different colors\r\ninto the two teats of the gland demonstrate that the cavities drained by\r\nthem do not communicate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 416.—CROSS-SECTION OF MAMMARY GLANDS OF COW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Body of gland; _b_, lactiferous sinus; _c_, cavity of teat; _d_,\r\n    duct of teat; _e_, intermammary groove; _f_, septum between glands;\r\n    _g_, supramammary fat.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The size and form of the glands vary greatly; in the highly\r\n  specialized dairy breeds (_e. g._, Holsteins) they often attain\r\n  enormous dimensions. The size of the udder is not a certain index of\r\n  its productivity, since some so-called “fleshy” udders contain a very\r\n  large amount of interstitial tissue and relatively little parenchyma.\r\n  Small accessory teats often occur posteriorly; commonly these are\r\n  rudimentary and imperforate (polythelia), but sometimes they drain a\r\n  small amount of gland substance (polymastia). Sanson described a case\r\n  in which there were seven teats, all giving milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach teat has a single duct which widens superiorly and opens freely\r\ninto a roomy =lactiferous sinus= or milk cistern (Sinus lactiferus). The\r\n=lactiferous duct= or teat canal is lined by a glandless mucous membrane\r\nwhich is covered with stratified squamous epithelium; the lower part\r\n(ca. 1 cm.) of the canal is narrow, and is closed by a =sphincter= of\r\nunstriped muscle. The =mucous membrane= of the sinus forms numerous\r\nfolds which render the cavity multilocular.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The blood-supply is derived from the =external\r\npudic arteries=. The =veins= form a circle at the base of the udder,\r\nfrom which the blood is drained by three trunks, viz., the very large\r\n=subcutaneous abdominal= (“milk vein”), the =external pudic=, and the\r\n=perineal vein=. The =lymphatics= are numerous, and pass to the\r\nsupramammary glands chiefly. The nerves are derived from the =inguinal\r\nnerves= and the =posterior mesenteric plexus= of the sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       GENITAL ORGANS OF THE SOW\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 417.—GENITAL ORGANS OF SOW, DORSAL VIEW. THE VAGINA AND CERVIX\r\n    UTERI ARE SLIT OPEN.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Labia vulvæ; _2_, glans clitoridis; _3_, vulva; _4_, external\r\n    urethral orifice; _5_, vagina; _5′_, cervix uteri; _6_, corpus\r\n    uteri; _7_, cornua uteri, one of which is opened at _7′_ to show\r\n    folds of mucous membrane; _8_, Fallopian tube; _8′_, abdominal\r\n    opening of tube; _9_, ovaries; _10_, ovarian bursa; _11_, broad\r\n    ligaments of uterus; _12_, urinary bladder. (From Leisering’s\r\n    Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =ovaries= are concealed in the bursa ovarii, owing to the large\r\nextent of the mesosalpinx. They are more rounded than in the bitch, and\r\nhave a distinct hilus. They are situated usually as in the cow, but\r\ntheir position is quite variable in animals which have borne young. The\r\nsurface commonly presents rounded prominences, so that sometimes the\r\ngland has an irregular, mulberry-like aspect; this is due to the fact\r\nthat there is very little stroma and the larger Graafian follicles\r\nproject from the surface.\r\n\r\nThe =Fallopian= or =uterine tubes= are long (ca. 15 to 30 cm.), and less\r\nflexuous than in the mare. The fimbriated extremity forms an ampulla and\r\nhas a large abdominal opening. The uterine end shades insensibly into\r\nthe small extremity of the cornu of the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe =uterus= presents several striking features. The =body= is only\r\nabout two inches (ca. 5 cm.) long. The =horns= are extremely long and\r\nflexuous, and are freely movable, on account of the large extent of the\r\nbroad ligaments. The extremities of the horns taper to about the\r\ndiameter of the Fallopian tubes.[154] The =neck= is remarkable for its\r\nlength (ca. 15 to 20 cm.) and the fact that it is directly continued by\r\nthe vagina without forming any intravaginal projection (os uteri). It\r\ncan be distinguished by the transverse folds of its mucous membrane and\r\nthe thickness of its wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The changes in form and position of the uterus during pregnancy are\r\n  similar to those mentioned later in the case of the bitch.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =vagina= is about four or five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) long in a\r\nsow of medium size. It is small in caliber, and has a thick muscular\r\ncoat which consists mainly of circular fibers. The mucous membrane is\r\nplicated, and is intimately united with the muscular coat.\r\n\r\nThe =vulva= is relatively long. The inferior commissure is pointed and\r\ndependent. The mucous lining is plicated. There is a small =suburethral\r\ndiverticulum=. The vestibular glands are small and variable in number.\r\nThe vestibular bulbs are little developed. The canals of Gartner may\r\nsometimes be traced as far as the ovary, but are often difficult to\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nThe =clitoris= is long, flexuous, and pointed; beneath it is a\r\ncul-de-sac.\r\n\r\nThe =urethra= is very long; its vulvar orifice is not concealed by a\r\nvalvular fold.\r\n\r\nThe =mammary glands= are usually ten or twelve in number, and are\r\narranged in two rows, as in the bitch. Each teat has commonly two\r\nexcretory ducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      GENITAL ORGANS OF THE BITCH\r\n\r\nThe =ovaries= (Fig. 336) are small, elongated-oval in outline, and\r\nflattened. Each ovary is situated close to or in contact with the\r\nposterior pole of the corresponding kidney, and thus lies ventral to the\r\nthird or fourth lumbar vertebræ, or about half-way between the last rib\r\nand the crest of the ilium. Each is concealed in a peritoneal pouch, the\r\n=bursa ovarii=, which has a slit-like opening ventrally. The two folds\r\nwhich form this pouch contain a quantity of fat and unstriped muscle.\r\nThey are continued to the cornu of the uterus, constituting the\r\n=mesosalpinx= and the =ovarian ligament=. The surface of the ovary\r\npresents prominences caused by projecting Graafian follicles. There is\r\nno distinct hilus.\r\n\r\nThe =Fallopian= or =uterine tubes= are small and average two or three\r\ninches (ca. 5 to 8 cm.) in length. Each passes at first forward and then\r\nturns backward, having a straight or only slightly flexuous course. The\r\nfimbriated extremity lies in the bursa ovarii, and has a rather large\r\nopening. The uterine orifice is very small.\r\n\r\nThe =uterus= has a very short body and two long narrow horns. In a bitch\r\nof medium size the body is about an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.) and the cornua\r\nfive or six inches (ca. 12 to 15 cm.) long. The horns are of uniform\r\ndiameter, are nearly straight, and lie entirely within the abdomen. They\r\ndiverge from the body in the form of a V toward each\r\nkidney. Their posterior parts are united by the peritoneum. The neck is\r\nvery short and is fused dorsally with the vagina. It has a thick\r\nmuscular coat. The mucous membrane of the uterus has long uterine glands\r\nand also short tubular crypts.\r\n\r\nThe =broad ligaments= contain fat and unstriped muscle. They are much\r\nlonger in the middle than at either end. The posterior part is attached\r\nto the anterior part of the vagina. The =round ligaments= are very long,\r\nextending through the inguinal canals, and traceable almost to the\r\nvulva.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The horns of the gravid uterus present dilatations or =ampullæ=, which\r\n  contain the fœtuses, and are separated by constrictions. The gravid\r\n  uterus lies on the ventral abdominal wall, and toward the end of\r\n  gestation extends forward to the stomach and liver.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =vagina= is relatively long. It is narrow anteriorly, and has no\r\ndistinct fornix. The muscular coat is thick and consists chiefly of\r\ncircular fibers. The mucous membrane forms longitudinal folds. The\r\ncanals of Gartner are usually absent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 418.—GENITAL ORGANS OF BITCH.\r\n\r\n  Vulva, vagina, and uterus (in part) are slit open. _a_, Ovarian bursa;\r\n    _b_, same opened to show the right ovary, _c_; _d_, _d_, horns of\r\n    uterus; _e_, _e′_, body of uterus; _f_, neck of uterus; _f′_, os\r\n    uteri; _g_, vagina; _h_, hymen; _i_, vulva; _k_, external urethral\r\n    orifice; _l_, urinary bladder; _m_, urethra; _n_, _n_, labia vulvæ;\r\n    _o_, fossa clitoridis; _p_, clitoris. (After Ellenberger, in\r\n    Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =vulva= has thick labia which form a pointed inferior commissure.\r\nThe mucous lining is smooth. On either side of the urethral orifice\r\nthere is a small depression. The glandulæ vestibulares majores are\r\nabsent, but the smaller glands are present, and their ducts open\r\nventrally on either side of a median ridge. The vestibular bulbs are\r\nrelatively large and join dorsally. The clitoris has a small pointed\r\nglans, beneath which is a diverticulum. The corpus cavernosum is a\r\nlittle more than an inch (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) long in a subject of medium\r\nsize, and is infiltrated with fat.\r\n\r\nThe =mammary glands= are usually ten in number, and are arranged in two\r\nseries extending from the posterior part of the pectoral region to the\r\ninguinal region; they are, therefore, designated according to location\r\nas =pectoral=, =abdominal=, and =inguinal=. The teats are short, and\r\npresent on their apices six to twelve small orifices of the excretory\r\nducts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ANGIOLOGY: THE VASCULAR SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\n=Angiology= is the description of the organs of circulation of the blood\r\nand lymph—the heart and vessels. The =heart= is the central hollow\r\nmuscular organ which functions as a suction and force pump; the\r\ndifferences in pressure caused by its contraction and relaxation\r\ndetermine the circulation of the blood and lymph. It is situated in the\r\nmiddle mediastinal space of the thorax, between the two lungs, and is\r\ninclosed in a fibro-serous sac—the pericardium. The vessels are tubular\r\nand run through almost all parts of the body. They are designated\r\naccording to their contents as =blood-= and =lymph vessels=.\r\n\r\nThe =blood-vascular system= consists of: (1) the =arteries=, which\r\nconvey blood from the heart to the tissues; (2) the =capillaries=,\r\nmicroscopic tubes in the tissues which permit of the necessary\r\ninterchange between the blood and the tissues; (3) the =veins=, which\r\nconvey the blood back to the heart.\r\n\r\nThe blood-vessels are divided into the =pulmonary= and the =systemic=.\r\nThe =pulmonary artery= conveys the blood from the right ventricle of the\r\nheart to the lungs, where it is arterialized, and is returned by the\r\n=pulmonary veins= to the left atrium of the heart, and passes into the\r\nleft ventricle. The =systemic arteries= convey the blood from the left\r\nventricle all over the body, whence it is returned by the =venæ cavæ= to\r\nthe right atrium, and passes into the right ventricle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It should be noted, however, that the lungs receive arterial blood\r\n  through the systemic bronchial arteries. This blood is returned in\r\n  part by the bronchial veins to the right atrium (indirectly), in part\r\n  by the pulmonary veins to the left atrium.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term =portal system= is often applied to the portal vein and its\r\ntributaries which come from the stomach, intestine, pancreas, and\r\nspleen. The vein enters the liver, where it branches like an artery, so\r\nthat the blood in this subsidiary system passes through a second set of\r\ncapillaries before being conveyed to the heart by the hepatic veins and\r\nthe posterior vena cava.\r\n\r\nThe =arteries= (Arteriæ), as a rule, divide at an acute angle, giving\r\noff finer and finer branches. In some cases branches come off at a right\r\nangle, and others are recurrent, _i. e._, run in a direction opposite to\r\nthat of the parent stem. The intercommunication of branches of adjacent\r\narteries is termed =anastomosis=. Most commonly the connections are made\r\nby a network of numerous fine branches (Plexus vasculosus). Relatively\r\nlarge communicating branches (Rami communicantes) occur in certain\r\nplaces; they may be transverse or in the form of arches. Wide-meshed\r\nnetworks of vessels are termed =Retia vasculosa=. =Terminal= or =end\r\narteries= are such as form isolated networks, _i. e._, do not anastomose\r\nwith adjacent arteries. A =rete mirabile= is a network intercalated in\r\nthe course of an artery. A =collateral vessel= (Vas collaterale) is one\r\nwhich pursues a course near and similar to that of a larger vessel.\r\n\r\nThe =veins= (Venæ) are in general arranged like the arteries, but are\r\nusually of greater caliber. When a vein accompanies an artery, it is\r\ntermed a =vena comitans= or =satellite vein=; in many places two veins\r\naccompany a single artery. The primitive venous trunks do not run with\r\nthe arteries, and most of the superficial veins (Venæ cutaneæ) pursue\r\nindependent courses. They anastomose even more freely than the arteries,\r\nand large communicating branches are very common. The veins form very\r\nrich plexuses (Plexus venosi) in many places. Some veins which are\r\nwithout independent walls and are inclosed by dense membranes and run\r\nusually in bony grooves are termed (venous) =sinuses=; examples of this\r\nare the sinuses of the dura mater of the brain.\r\n\r\n=Structure of Arteries.=—The wall consists of three coats. The =external\r\ncoat= (Tunica externa) consists chiefly of fibrous connective tissue. In\r\nthe deeper part are some elastic fibers, and in some arteries there are\r\nalso longitudinal unstriped muscle-fibers. The =middle coat= (Tunica\r\nmedia) is composed of unstriped muscle and elastic tissue in\r\nmedium-sized arteries. In small vessels there is only the muscular\r\ntissue, and in the largest trunks only elastic tissue. The =internal\r\ncoat= or =intima= (Tunica intima) consists of a layer of endothelial\r\ncells, resting on an elastic membrane. The =sheath= (Vagina vasis) is a\r\ncondensation of the surrounding connective tissue, and is attached more\r\nor less closely to the external coat.\r\n\r\n=Structure of Veins.=—The walls of veins are similar in structure to\r\nthose of the arteries, but are very much thinner, so that veins collapse\r\nmore or less completely when empty, while arteries do not. The =middle\r\ncoat= is very thin and consists to a large extent of ordinary connective\r\ntissue. The =intima= is also less elastic than in the arteries. In many\r\nveins this coat forms semilunar =valves=, the free edges of which are\r\ndirected toward the heart. They are most numerous in the veins of the\r\nskin and the deep veins of the extremities (except the foot), while in\r\nmost veins of the body cavities and viscera they are absent or occur\r\nonly where the veins open into larger ones or where two veins join.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the vessels are supplied with blood by numerous small\r\narteries, called =vasa vasorum=. These arise from branches of the artery\r\nwhich they supply or from adjacent arteries, ramify in the external\r\ncoat, and enter the middle coat also.\r\n\r\nThe =nerves= of the vessels consist of both medullated and\r\nnon-medullated fibers. They form plexuses around the vessels, from which\r\nfibers pass mainly to the muscular tissue of the middle coat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE PERICARDIUM[155]\r\n\r\nThe =pericardium= is the fibro-serous sac which surrounds the heart, and\r\nalso the great vessels in connection with it to a greater or less\r\nextent. Its form is in general similar to that of the heart. The\r\n=fibrous layer= is relatively thin, but strong and inelastic. It is\r\nattached dorsally to the large vessels at the base of the heart, and is\r\ncontinued in part up to the longus colli muscle. Ventrally it is firmly\r\nattached to the middle of the posterior half of the thoracic surface of\r\nthe sternum. The =serous layer= is a closed sac, surrounded by the\r\nfibrous pericardium, and invaginated by the heart. It is smooth and\r\nglistening, and contains a small amount of clear serous fluid, the\r\n=liquor pericardii=. Like other serous membranes, it may be regarded as\r\nconsisting of two parts, parietal and visceral. The =parietal part=\r\nlines the fibrous layer, to which it is closely attached. The =visceral\r\nlayer= covers the heart and parts of the great vessels, and is therefore\r\nalso termed the =epicardium=. The serous pericardium is composed of a\r\nconnective-tissue membrane, rich in elastic fibers, and covered on its\r\nfree surface by a layer of flat endothelial cells.\r\n\r\nThe pericardium is covered by the mediastinal pleura (Pleura\r\npericardica) and is crossed laterally by the phrenic nerves. Its lateral\r\nsurfaces are related chiefly to the lungs, but the lower part is in\r\npartial contact with the chest-wall. On the left side the area of\r\ncontact is from the third to the fifth intercostal space inclusive. On\r\nthe right side the contact is smaller and is at the third and fourth\r\nribs. The anterior border of the base is opposite to the second\r\nintercostal space, and the posterior border is opposite to the sixth rib\r\nor space. The base is related to the great vessels, the trachea and its\r\nbifurcation, the bronchial lymph glands, the œsophagus, and the vagus,\r\nleft recurrent, and cardiac nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The two parts of the serous pericardium are, of course, continuous\r\n  with each other at the line of reflection on to the great vessels. The\r\n  latter are covered in varying degree by the visceral layer. The aorta\r\n  and pulmonary artery are inclosed in a complete common sheath as far\r\n  as the bifurcation of the latter. A pouch passes inward between the\r\n  pulmonary artery and the left auricle, and is connected with another\r\n  pouch which passes backward between the right auricle and the aorta,\r\n  thus forming the great transverse sinus of the pericardium. The\r\n  posterior vena cava is covered on the right and below for a distance\r\n  of an inch or a little more (ca. 3 cm.). The pulmonary veins receive\r\n  practically no serous covering. The epicardium is closely adherent to\r\n  the muscular tissue of the heart, but is attached to the vessels by\r\n  loose tissue and fat, and hence is easily dissected off them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE HEART\r\n\r\nThe =heart= (Cor) occupies the greater part of the middle mediastinal\r\nspace. Its shape is that of an irregular and somewhat flattened cone. It\r\nis attached at its base by the great vessels, but is otherwise entirely\r\nfree in the pericardium. It presents two surfaces, two borders, a base,\r\nand an apex for description.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 419.—HEART OF HORSE, LEFT VIEW. HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n\r\n  The dotted line indicates the line of reflection of the serous\r\n    pericardium. The epicardium and subepicardial fat have not been\r\n    removed from the heart.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn =position= the heart is decidedly asymmetrical, about two-fifths\r\nbeing to the right of the median plane and three-fifths to the left. The\r\nlong axis (from the middle of the base to the apex) is directed\r\ndownward, backward, and somewhat to the left. The =base= (Basis cordis)\r\nis directed dorsally and lies a little above the middle of the\r\ndorso-ventral diameter of the thorax. It is opposite to the ribs from\r\nthe third to the sixth inclusive. The =apex= (Apex cordis) lies above\r\nthe last segment of the sternum, and is separated by a very short\r\ninterval from the sternal part of the diaphragm. The =anterior border=\r\n(Margo cranialis) is strongly convex and is directed obliquely downward\r\nand backward; its lower part is parallel with the sternum. The\r\n=posterior border= (Margo caudalis) is much shorter, nearly vertical,\r\nand is opposite to the sixth rib or intercostal space. The =surfaces=,\r\n=right= and =left= (Facies dextra, sinistra), are convex and are marked\r\nby =grooves= which indicate the division of the heart into four\r\nchambers, the two atria above and two ventricles below. The left surface\r\n(covered by the pericardium) is in contact with the lower third of the\r\nchest-wall from the third to the fifth intercostal space. On the right\r\nside the cardiac notch of the lung is smaller and further forward, so\r\nthat the area of contact is at the third and fourth ribs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 420.—HEART OF HORSE, RIGHT VIEW. HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n\r\n  Line of reflection of serous pericardium dotted. Epicardium and\r\n    subepicardial fat have not been removed from heart. Left ventricle\r\n    is considerably contracted.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =coronary= or =atrio-ventricular groove= (Sulcus coronarius)\r\nindicates the division between the atria and the ventricles. It almost\r\ncompletely encircles the heart, but is interrupted by the origin of the\r\npulmonary artery. The =longitudinal= or =interventricular grooves=,\r\nright and left (Sulci longitudinales sinister et dexter), correspond to\r\nthe septum between the ventricles. The left groove is left-anterior in\r\nposition. It begins at the coronary groove behind the origin of the\r\npulmonary artery, and passes downward almost parallel to the posterior\r\nborder, but does not reach the apex. The right groove is right posterior\r\nin position. It begins at the coronary groove below the termination of\r\nthe posterior vena cava and passes downward and a little backward,\r\nending about an inch and a half (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) above the apex. The\r\ngrooves are occupied by the coronary vessel and a variable quantity of\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 421.—BASE OF HEART OF HORSE WITH LARGE VESSELS, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n    SPECIMEN HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Size and Weight.=—In horses of medium size the heart usually weighs\r\nabout seven or eight pounds (ca. 3.5 kg.), or about 0.7 per cent. of the\r\nbody-weight. There is, however, great range of variation in apparently\r\nnormal specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The following measurements were obtained in medium-sized hearts in\r\n  diastole:\r\n\r\n Sagittal diameter of base                                          25 cm.\r\n Greatest width of base                                       18 to 20 cm.\r\n Circumference at coronary groove                             65 to 70 cm.\r\n Distance between origin of pulmonary artery and apex               25 cm.\r\n Distance between termination of posterior vena cava and apex 18 to 20 cm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE RIGHT ATRIUM\r\n\r\nThe =right atrium= (Atrium dextrum) or auricle forms the right-anterior\r\npart of the base of the heart, and lies above the right ventricle. It\r\nconsists of a =sinus venosus=, into which the veins open, and an\r\n=auricle= or auricular appendix. The latter is a conical diverticulum\r\nwhich curves around the right and anterior surfaces of the aorta, its\r\nblind end appearing on the left side in front of the origin of the\r\npulmonary artery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 422.—RIGHT SIDE OF HEART OF HORSE OPENED UP BY REMOVAL OF GREATER\r\n    PART OF RIGHT WALL. ORGAN HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n\r\n  The right ventricle was in diastole. _r_, Intervenous crest; _v_, _v_,\r\n    tricuspid valve; _p_, _p_, papillary muscles; _m_, _m_, moderator\r\n    bands. Arrow points into origin of pulmonary artery.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are five chief openings in the right atrium. The =opening of the\r\nanterior vena cava= (Ostium venæ cavæ cranialis) is in the upper and\r\nfore part. The =opening of the posterior vena cava= (Ostium venæ cavæ\r\ncaudalis) is at the lower posterior part. Between the two the wall\r\npouches upward somewhat, forming what is sometimes termed the sinus\r\nvenosus or sac of Lower. In the anterior part of this the =vena azygos=\r\nopens. The =coronary sinus= opens immediately below the posterior vena\r\ncava; the orifice is provided with a small semilunar valve or valve of\r\nThebesius (Valvula sinus coronarii). The middle coronary vein has a\r\nseparate opening in some cases close to that of the coronary sinus. The\r\n=atrio-ventricular opening= is in the lower part, and leads into the\r\nright ventricle. In addition to the foregoing there are several small\r\norifices of the venæ cordis parvæ; these are concealed in the\r\ndepressions between the musculi pectinati.\r\n\r\nThe atrium is lined with a glistening membrane, the =endocardium=. Its\r\nwalls are smooth except on the right and in the auricle (or appendix),\r\nwhere it is crossed in various directions by muscular ridges, the\r\n=musculi pectinati=. Small bands extend across some of the spaces\r\ninclosed by the musculi pectinati. The latter terminate above on a\r\ncurved crest, the =crista terminales=, which indicates the junction of\r\nthe primitive sinus venosus of the embryo with the atrium proper, and\r\ncorresponds with the sulcus terminalis externally. The openings of the\r\nvenæ cavæ are without valves. A ridge, the intervenous crest,[156]\r\nprojects downward and forward from the roof just in front of the opening\r\nof the posterior vena cava; it tends to direct the flow of blood from\r\nthe anterior vena cava to the atrio-ventricular opening. The =fossa\r\novalis= is an oval depression in the septal wall at the point of\r\nentrance of the posterior vena cava, bounded internally by a thick\r\nmargin (Limbus fossæ ovalis). The fossa is the remains of an opening,\r\nthe =foramen ovale=, through which the two atria communicate in the\r\nfœtus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE LEFT ATRIUM\r\n\r\nThe =left atrium= (Atrium sinistrum) or auricle forms the posterior part\r\nof the base of the heart. It lies behind the pulmonary artery and the\r\naorta and above the left ventricle. The auricle (or appendix) extends\r\noutward and forward on the left side, and its blind end is behind the\r\norigin of the pulmonary artery. The =pulmonary veins=, usually seven or\r\neight in number, open into the atrium behind and on the right side. The\r\ncavity of the atrium is smooth, with the exception of the auricle (or\r\nappendix), in which the musculi pectinati are present. In some cases\r\nthere is a depression on the septal wall opposite the fossa ovalis,\r\nbounded above by a fold which is the remnant of the valve of the foramen\r\novale of the fœtus. The =atrio-ventricular opening= is situated below\r\nand in front; it usually appears smaller than the right one on account\r\nof the contraction of the left ventricle in the dead subject. The\r\napertures of small veins of the heart are found in the spaces inclosed\r\nby the musculi pectinati.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The number and the arrangement of the pulmonary veins are variable.\r\n  They may be five to nine in number. The largest orifice is posterior.\r\n  Usually three veins of considerable size enter close together on the\r\n  right above the posterior vena cava, and three or four open close to\r\n  the ridge which projects from the roof at the base of the auricle\r\n  (appendix).\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE RIGHT VENTRICLE\r\n\r\nThe =right ventricle= (Ventriculus dexter) constitutes the\r\nright-anterior part of the ventricular mass. It forms almost all of the\r\nanterior border of the heart, but does not reach the apex, which is\r\nformed entirely by the left ventricle. It extends from the third rib to\r\nthe fourth intercostal space on the left side, to the fifth rib and\r\nspace on the right side. It is somewhat triangular in outline, and is\r\nsemilunar in cross-section. Its base faces upward and a little to the\r\nright and is connected largely with the right atrium, with which it\r\ncommunicates through the atrio-ventricular orifice; but its left part\r\nprojects higher and forms the =conus arteriosus=, from which the\r\npulmonary artery arises. Its apex is two inches or more (ca. 5 to 6 cm.)\r\nabove the apex of the heart. On opening the cavity it is seen that the\r\ntwo openings are separated by a thick rounded ridge (Crista\r\nsupraventricularis). The axis of the cavity, taken from this ridge to\r\nthe apex forms a spiral curve downward and to the right. The septal wall\r\nis convex and faces obliquely forward and to the right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 423.—SECTION OF HEART OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  Specimen hardened _in situ_ and cut nearly at right angles to the\r\n    ventricular septum. The left ventricle is contracted, but not _ad\r\n    maximum_. _V. a._, Segment of aortic valve.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =right atrio-ventricular orifice= (Ostium venosum dextrum) is oval\r\nand is situated opposite to the lower parts of the third and fourth\r\nribs. It is guarded by a =tricuspid valve= (Valvula tricuspidalis); of\r\nthe three large cusps of this valve, one is between the\r\natrio-ventricular opening and the conus arteriosus, one is septal, and\r\nthe third is on the right margin. Small intermediate cusps intervene\r\nbetween the large ones. The peripheral edges of the cusps are attached\r\nto the fibrous ring at the atrio-ventricular opening. The central edges\r\nare irregular and hang down into the ventricle; they give attachment to\r\nchordæ tendineæ. The auricular surfaces are smooth. The ventricular\r\nsurfaces are rough and furnish attachment to interlacing branches of the\r\nchordæ tendineæ. The valves are folds of the endocardium, strengthened\r\nby fibrous tissue and at the periphery by muscular fibers also. The\r\n=chordæ tendineæ= are attached below to the three =musculi papillares=,\r\nwhich project from the ventricular wall; superiorly they divide into\r\nbranches which are inserted into the ventricular surfaces and the free\r\nedges of the valves. Each segment of the valve receives chordæ tendineæ\r\nfrom two papillary muscles. Of the latter, two are on the septum and the\r\nthird and largest springs from the anterior wall.\r\n\r\nThe =pulmonary orifice= (Ostium arteriæ pulmonalis) is circular and is\r\nsituated at the summit of the conus arteriosus, opposite to the lower\r\npart of the third intercostal space. It is guarded by the =pulmonary\r\nvalve=, composed of three semilunar cusps (Valvulæ semilunares arteriæ\r\npulmonalis); of these, one is internal, one external, and the third\r\nposterior. The convex peripheral border of each cusp is attached to the\r\nfibrous ring at the junction of the pulmonary artery and the conus\r\narteriosus. The central border is free and slightly concave. Each cusp\r\nconsists of a layer of endocardium on its ventricular surface, a\r\ncontinuation of the inner coat of the artery on its arterial surface,\r\nand an intermediate layer of fibrous tissue. The upper edge of the conus\r\narteriosus forms three arches with intermediate projecting angles or\r\nhorns, to all of which the cusps are attached; and the artery forms\r\nopposite each cusp a pouch, the sinus of the pulmonary artery (or of\r\nValsalva).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 424.—SECTION OF HEART OF HORSE. SPECIMEN HARDENED _in situ_.\r\n\r\n  The section is cut nearly at right angles to the ventricular septum,\r\n    and is viewed from the right and posteriorly.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe walls of the ventricle (except in the conus arteriosus) bear\r\nmuscular ridges and bands, termed =trabeculæ carneæ=. These are of three\r\nkinds, viz., (1) ridges or columns in relief; (2) musculi papillares,\r\nsomewhat conical flattened projections, continuous at the base with the\r\nwall and giving off the chordæ tendineæ to the tricuspid valve; (3)\r\nmoderator bands (Musculi transversi cordis) which extend from the septum\r\nto the opposite wall. The latter are partly muscular, partly tendinous,\r\nand vary in different subjects. The strongest one is usually about\r\nmidway between the base and apex and extends from the septum to the base\r\nof the anterior musculus papillaris. It is considered that they tend to\r\nprevent overdistention.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE LEFT VENTRICLE\r\n\r\nThe =left ventricle= (Ventriculus sinister) forms the left posterior\r\npart of the ventricular mass. It is more regularly conical than the\r\nright ventricle and its wall is much thicker except at the apex. It\r\nforms all of the posterior border of the ventricular part and the apex\r\nof the heart. Its base is largely continuous with the left atrium, with\r\nwhich it communicates through the left atrio-ventricular opening, but in\r\nfront it opens into the aorta. The cavity usually appears smaller than\r\nthat of the right ventricle in the dead subject, on account of the\r\ngreater contraction of its wall. It is almost circular in cross-section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 425.—THE BASES OF THE VENTRICLES OF THE HEART OF THE HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The atria have been removed and the aorta and pulmonary artery cut off\r\n    short. The left ventricle is contracted. _p.v._, Pulmonary valve;\r\n    _a.v._, aortic valve.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =left atrio-ventricular orifice= (Ostium venosum sinistrum) is\r\nopposite to the fifth rib and intercostal space. It is almost circular\r\nand is guarded by the =bicuspid= or =mitral valve= (Valvula\r\nbicuspidalis). The two segments of this valve are larger and thicker\r\nthan those of the right side of the heart. One is placed in front and\r\nseparates the atrio-ventricular and aortic openings. The other is placed\r\nbehind and laterally and is usually divided into two or three flaps.\r\n\r\nThe =aortic orifice= (Ostium aorticum) is directed upward and slightly\r\nforward. It is situated opposite to the fourth rib. It is guarded by the\r\n=aortic valve=, composed of three semilunar cusps (Valvulæ semilunares\r\naortæ); one cusp is anterior, the others right and left posterior. They\r\nare similar to those of the pulmonary valve, but are much stronger. The\r\nfree edge of each contains a central nodule of fibrous tissue, the\r\ncorpus Arantii (Nodulus valvulæ semilunaris).\r\n\r\nThe =chordæ tendineæ= are fewer but larger than those of the right\r\nventricle.\r\n\r\nThere are two large =musculi papillares=, one on each side; they are\r\nusually compound. The moderator bands are variable. Commonly two or\r\nthree larger ones (which are often branched) extend from the musculi\r\npapillares to the septum. Smaller ones may be found in various places,\r\nespecially at the apex. The other trabeculæ are fewer and less prominent\r\nthan in the right ventricle.\r\n\r\nThe =interventricular septum= (Septum ventriculorum) is the\r\nmusculo-membranous partition which separates the cavities of the two\r\nventricles. It is placed obliquely. One surface is convex, faces forward\r\nand to the right, and bulges into the right ventricle. The other\r\nsurface, which faces into the left ventricle, is concave and looks\r\nbackward and to the left. The greater part of the septum is thick and\r\nmuscular (Septum musculare), but the upper part is thin and membranous\r\n(Septum membranaceum). The latter intervenes between the left ventricle,\r\non the one hand, and the right ventricle and atrium on the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         STRUCTURE OF THE HEART\r\n\r\nThe heart-wall consists mainly of peculiar striped muscle, the\r\nmyocardium, which is covered externally by the visceral part of the\r\nserous pericardium or epicardium, and is lined by the endocardium.\r\n\r\nThe =epicardium= is in general closely attached to the muscular wall,\r\nbut is loosely attached over the coronary vessels and the associated\r\nsubepicardial fat. It consists of a layer of flat polygonal cells,\r\nresting on a membrane of white and elastic fibers.\r\n\r\nThe =myocardium= consists of planes of fibers arranged in a somewhat\r\ncomplicated manner. The muscular tissue of the atria is almost\r\ncompletely separated from that of the ventricles by the fibrous rings\r\naround the atrio-ventricular orifices.\r\n\r\nIn the atria the muscle bands fall naturally into two groups—superficial\r\nand deep. The former are common to both atria, the latter special to\r\neach. The =superficial= or =common fibers= for the most part begin and\r\nend at the atrio-ventricular rings, but some enter the interatrial\r\nseptum. The =deep= or =special bundles= also form two sets. Looped\r\nfibers pass over the atria from ring to ring, while annular or spiral\r\nfibers surround the ends of the veins which open into the atria, the\r\nauricles, and the fossa ovalis.\r\n\r\nThe muscular wall of the ventricles is much stronger than that of the\r\natria. That of the left ventricle is in general about three times as\r\nthick as that of the right one, but is thin at the apex. The\r\n=superficial fibers= are attached above to the atrio-ventricular fibrous\r\nrings and pass in a spiral toward the apex. Here they bend upon\r\nthemselves and pass deeply upward to terminate in a papillary muscle of\r\nthe ventricle opposite to that in which they arose. The loops so formed\r\nat the apex constitute a whorl, the =vortex cordis=. The =deep fibers=,\r\nalthough they appear to be proper to each ventricle, have been shown by\r\nMacCallum to be in reality almost all common to both. Their arrangement\r\nis scroll-like. They begin on one side, curve around in the wall of that\r\nventricle, then pass in the septum to the opposite side, and curve\r\naround the other ventricle. There is a layer of deep fibers which is\r\nconfined to the basal part of the left ventricle; it is attached to the\r\nleft atrio-ventricular ring.\r\n\r\nFour =fibrous rings= (Annuli fibrosi) surround the orifices at the bases\r\nof the ventricles. The atrio-ventricular rings separate the musculature\r\nof the atria from that of the ventricles. Those which surround the\r\norigins of the pulmonary artery and aorta are festooned in conformity\r\nwith the attached borders of the valves. The aortic ring contains on the\r\nright side a plate of cartilage (Cartilago cordis), which frequently\r\nbecomes more or less calcified in old animals. Sometimes a smaller plate\r\nis present on the left side.\r\n\r\nThe =endocardium= lines the cavities of the heart and is continuous with\r\nthe internal coat of the vessels which enter and leave the organ. Its\r\nfree surface is smooth and glistening and is formed by a layer of\r\nendothelial cells. The latter rest on a thin layer of connective tissue,\r\nwhich is connected with the myocardium by a subendocardial elastic\r\ntissue containing vessels and nerves.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The heart receives its blood-supply through the\r\ntwo =coronary arteries= which arise from the aorta opposite to the\r\nanterior and left cusps of the aortic valve. Most of the blood is\r\nreturned by the =coronary veins=, which open into the right atrium by\r\nthe coronary sinus.[157] A few small veins open directly into the right\r\natrium, and others are said to open into the left atrium and the\r\nventricles. The =lymph vessels= form a subepicardial network which\r\ncommunicates through stomata with the cavity of the pericardium. There\r\nis a less distinct subendocardial network. The vessels converge usually\r\nto two trunks which accompany the blood-vessels in the atrio-ventricular\r\ngrooves and enter the glands at the bifurcation of the trachea. The\r\n=nerves= are derived from the =vagus= and =sympathetic= through the\r\ncardiac plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE ARTERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE PULMONARY ARTERY\r\n\r\nThe =pulmonary artery= (A. pulmonalis) springs from the conus arteriosus\r\nat the left side of the base of the right ventricle. It curves upward,\r\nbackward, and inward, and divides behind the arch of the aorta into\r\nright and left branches. It is related in front to the right auricle\r\n(appendix), behind to the left auricle (appendix), and internally to the\r\naorta. It is enveloped with the latter in a common sheath of the\r\nvisceral layer of the serous pericardium. Near the bifurcation it is\r\nconnected with the arch of the aorta by a fibrous band about half an\r\ninch (ca. 1.2 cm.) in width; this is the =ligamentum arteriosum=, a\r\nremnant of the large =ductus arteriosus=, which conducts most of the\r\nblood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta in the fœtus. The artery is\r\nbulbous at its origin, and forms three =sinuses= or pouches, which\r\ncorrespond to the cusps of the semilunar valve. Beyond this it gradually\r\ndiminishes in caliber.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In a horse of medium size the artery is about seven inches (ca. 17 to\r\n  18 cm.) long. At the origin it is about two and a half inches (ca. 6\r\n  to 6.5 cm.) in width; at the bifurcation its caliber is about one and\r\n  a half inches (ca. 3.5 to 4 cm.). The wall is relatively thin,\r\n  especially at the origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =right branch= (Ramus dexter) of the pulmonary artery is a little\r\nlonger and wider than the left one. It passes over the fore part of the\r\nleft atrium and below the bifurcation of the trachea to the hilus of the\r\nright lung, and enters the latter below the right bronchus. In the lung\r\nit passes to the outer and lower side of the stem bronchus and\r\naccompanies it to the base of the organ. The branches correspond to the\r\nramification of the bronchi. The =left branch= (Ramus sinister) is very\r\nshort. It passes backward and enters the lung below the left bronchus.\r\nIts branches within the lung are arranged like that of the right one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SYSTEMIC ARTERIES\r\n\r\nThe =aorta= is the main systemic arterial trunk. It begins at the base\r\nof the left ventricle and is practically median at its origin. It passes\r\nupward and slightly forward between the pulmonary artery on the left and\r\nright atrium on the right. It then curves sharply backward and upward\r\nand inclines somewhat to the left, forming the =arch of the aorta=\r\n(Arcus aortæ), and reaches the ventral surface of the spine at the\r\neighth or ninth thoracic vertebra. After passing backward along the\r\nventral aspect of the bodies of the vertebræ between the lungs it\r\ntraverses the hiatus aorticus and enters the abdominal cavity, where it\r\nlies below the vertebral bodies and the psoas minor, just to the left of\r\nthe median plane. It divides under the fifth lumbar vertebra into the\r\ntwo internal iliac or hypogastric arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n  From the bifurcation a small vessel, the middle sacral artery (A.\r\n  sacralis media), sometimes passes backward on the pelvic surface of\r\n  the sacrum. It becomes lost in the periosteum or joins the coccygeal\r\n  artery, or in exceptional cases is traceable to the sphincter ani\r\n  externus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe caliber of the aorta is greatest at its origin, which is termed the\r\n=bulbus aortæ=. Here it forms three pouch-like dilatations, the =sinuses\r\nof the aorta= (or of Valsalva). These correspond to the cusps of the\r\naortic valve, and the coronary arteries arise from the left posterior\r\nand anterior sinuses. At the arch the diameter is about two inches (ca.\r\n5 cm.), and beyond this it diminishes gradually in width.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 426.—CARDIAC VESSELS OF HORSE, RIGHT SIDE.\r\n\r\n  Veins are black, arteries white.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to divide the aorta into thoracic and abdominal parts.\r\nThe =thoracic aorta= (Aorta thoracica) lies within the pericardium to\r\nthe point of attachment of the ligamentum arteriosum, and is inclosed\r\nwith the pulmonary artery in a prolongation of the epicardium. Beyond\r\nthis it is between the two pleural sacs. It is crossed on the right by\r\nthe œsophagus and trachea, on the left by the left vagus nerve. The left\r\nrecurrent nerve winds around the concavity of the arch from left to\r\nright, and the vena azygos and thoracic duct lie along the dorsal part\r\nof its right face. The trachea causes it to deviate to the left; but\r\nbeyond this it becomes median. The =abdominal aorta= (Aorta abdominalis)\r\n(Fig. 450) is related above to the lumbar vertebræ, the inferior common\r\nligament, and the left psoas minor muscle; in the hiatus aorticus it is\r\nrelated to the cisterna chyli. On its right is the posterior vena cava,\r\nand on its left the left kidney and ureter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BRANCHES OF THE THORACIC AORTA\r\n\r\n\r\n                          1. CORONARY ARTERIES\r\n\r\nThe two coronary arteries, right and left, are distributed almost\r\nentirely to the heart, but send some small twigs to the origins of the\r\ngreat vessels.\r\n\r\nThe =right coronary artery= (A. coronaria dextra) arises from the\r\nanterior sinus of the aorta. It passes forward between the conus\r\narteriosus and the right auricle (appendix) to the coronary groove, in\r\nwhich it curves around to the right and backward. It then descends in\r\nthe right ventricular groove almost to the apex of the heart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 427.—CARDIAC VESSELS OF HORSE, LEFT SIDE.\r\n\r\n  The dotted lines indicate part of the left coronary artery which is\r\n    concealed by the left auricle.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =left coronary artery= (A. coronaria sinistra) arises from the left\r\nposterior sinus of the aorta, passes to the left behind the origin of\r\nthe pulmonary artery, and divides into two branches. The =descending\r\nbranch= (Ramus descendens) passes down the left ventricular groove\r\ntoward the apex. The =circumflex branch= (Ramus circumflexus) runs\r\nbackward in the coronary groove, in which it winds around to the right\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\r\n           2. COMMON BRACHIOCEPHALIC TRUNK OR ANTERIOR AORTA\r\n\r\nThe =common brachiocephalic trunk= or =anterior aorta= (Truncus\r\nbrachiocephalicus communis) is a very large vessel which arises from the\r\nconvexity of the arch of the aorta within the pericardium. It is\r\ndirected forward and upward. Its length in horses of medium size is\r\nusually about two inches (ca. 5 to 6 cm.), but it is sometimes only half\r\nan inch or less (ca. 1 cm.). It is crossed on the left by the left vagus\r\nand cardiac nerves, and the left recurrent nerve runs between it and the\r\ntrachea. It divides opposite to the second intercostal space or third\r\nrib into the brachiocephalic and left brachial arteries.\r\n\r\nThe =brachiocephalic artery= (A. brachiocephalica) is directed forward\r\nand a little upward in the anterior mediastinum, beneath the trachea.\r\nOpposite the first rib it gives off the bicarotid trunk and is continued\r\nas the =right brachial artery=. The latter (A. subclavia dextra) turns\r\ndownward and bends around the anterior border of the first rib and the\r\ninsertion of the scalenus muscle above the brachial vein. Its course and\r\nbranches beyond this point will be described with the vessels of the\r\nthoracic limb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 428.—TOPOGRAPHY OF THORACIC CAVITY OF HORSE, LEFT SIDE, AFTER\r\n    REMOVAL OF LEFT LUNG.\r\n\r\n  The ninth, fifteenth, and eighteenth ribs are retained. _a_,\r\n    Pericardium; _b_, thoracic aorta; _c_, brachiocephalic trunk; _d_,\r\n    _d″_, dorsal artery; _d′_, subcostal artery; _e_, _e′_, superior or\r\n    deep cervical artery; _f_, vertebral artery; _g_, _g′_, left\r\n    brachial artery; _h_, inferior cervical artery; _i_, internal\r\n    thoracic artery; _k_, common carotid artery; _l_, jugular vein; _m_,\r\n    brachial vein; _m′_, inferior cervical vein; _n_, anterior vena\r\n    cava; _o_, thoracic duct; _p_, œsophagus; _q_, costal part of\r\n    diaphragm; _q′_, tendinous center of same; _q″_, left crus of same;\r\n    _r_, anterior mediastinal lymph glands; _s_, trachea; _t_, bronchial\r\n    lymph glands; _u_, root of left lung; _v_, anterior mediastinum;\r\n    _v′_, posterior mediastinum; _w_, longus colli; _x_,\r\n    sterno-cephalicus; _y_, scalenus; _z_, transversalis costarum; _1_,\r\n    longissimus; _2_, splenius; _3_, spinalis et semispinalis; _4_,\r\n    _4′_, rhomboideus; _5_, left phrenic nerve; _6_, left vagus; _6′_,\r\n    _6″_, œsophageal continuations of vagi; _7_, dorsal branch of right\r\n    vagus; _8_, cardiac nerve; _9_, left recurrent nerve; _10_, cervical\r\n    trunk of sympathetic; _11_, first thoracic ganglion of sympathetic;\r\n    _12_, thoracic trunk of sympathetic; _13_, brachial plexus. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =left brachial artery= (A. subclavia sinistra) is longer than the\r\nright one and rises to a higher level. It forms an almost semicircular\r\ncurve, the concavity being ventral. It is related internally to the\r\nœsophagus, trachea, and thoracic duct, and the left vagus, phrenic, and\r\ncardiac nerves cross under its origin. It emerges from the thorax like\r\nthe artery of the right side. There is thus a difference at first\r\nbetween the trunks of opposite sides, but beyond this their course and\r\ndistribution are similar.\r\n\r\nThe brachial and brachiocephalic arteries within the thorax give off the\r\ndorsal, superior cervical, vertebral, and internal thoracic arteries. At\r\nthe first rib they give off the external thoracic and inferior cervical\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n1. The left =dorsal= or =dorso-intercostal artery= (A. costo-cervicalis)\r\npasses dorsally across the left face of the trachea and œsophagus toward\r\nthe second intercostal space. The right artery arises usually by a\r\ncommon trunk with the superior cervical, crosses the right face of the\r\ntrachea and has no contact with the œsophagus. Both detach small\r\nbranches to the trachea, lymph glands, and pleura, and divide on\r\nreaching the longus colli into two branches. Of these the =subcostal\r\nartery= (A. intercostalis suprema) is the smaller. It passes backward\r\nunder the costo-vertebral joints with the sympathetic trunk. It gives\r\noff the second, third, and fourth intercostal arteries, and ends at the\r\nfifth space, where it anastomoses with the first aortic intercostal\r\nartery, or constitutes the fifth intercostal artery, or dips into the\r\nlongissimus muscle. It also gives off spinal branches and twigs to the\r\nlongus colli and the pleura. The other branch (A. transversa colli) is\r\nthe direct continuation of the trunk. It emerges through the upper end\r\nof the second intercostal space, passes across the transversalis\r\ncostarum and longissimus toward the withers, and divides into several\r\ndiverging branches. An anterior branch passes upward and forward between\r\nthe splenius and complexus and anastomoses with branches of the superior\r\ncervical artery; the others are directed upward under the serratus\r\nmagnus and rhomboideus to the withers, supplying the muscles and skin of\r\nthis region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 429.—TOPOGRAPHY OF THORACIC CAVITY OF HORSE, RIGHT VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The ninth, fifteenth, and eighteenth ribs are retained. _a_,\r\n    Pericardium; _b_, posterior vena cava; _c_, vena azygos; _c′_,\r\n    œsophageal vein; _d_, _e_, anterior vena cava; _f_, brachial vein;\r\n    _g_, inferior cervical vein; _h_, jugular vein; _i_, vertebral vein;\r\n    _k_, superior cervical vein; _l_, dorsal vein; _m_, trachea; _n_,\r\n    root of right lung; _o_, œsophagus; _p_, mediastinal lobe of right\r\n    lung; _q_, mediastinum; _r_, bronchial lymph glands; _s_,\r\n    mediastinal lymph glands; _t_, costal part of diaphragm; _t′_,\r\n    tendinous center of same; _u_, intercostal muscle; _v_, longus\r\n    colli; _w_, posterior deep pectoral muscle; _w′_, anterior deep\r\n    pectoral muscle; _x_, superficial pectoral muscle; _y_,\r\n    sterno-cephalicus; _z_, scalenus; _1_, _5_, right brachial artery;\r\n    _2_, dorso-cervical trunk; _2′_, superior or deep cervical artery;\r\n    _3_, dorsal artery (cut); _3′_, subcostal artery; _4_, internal\r\n    thoracic artery; _6_, external thoracic artery; _7_, inferior\r\n    cervical artery; _8_, bicarotid trunk; _10_, aorta; _11_, œsophageal\r\n    artery; _12_, thoracic duct; _13_, right phrenic nerve; _14_,\r\n    brachial plexus; _15_, right vagus; _15′_, _15″_, œsophageal\r\n    continuations of vagi; _16_, right recurrent nerve; _17_, cervical\r\n    trunk of sympathetic; _18_, thoracic trunk of sympathetic; _20_,\r\n    inferior cervical ganglion; _21_, first thoracic ganglion of\r\n    sympathetic; _22_, right cardiac nerve; _23_, longissimus; _24_,\r\n    transversalis costarum; _25_, spinalis; _26_, multifidus; _27_,\r\n    ligamentum nuchæ. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The left dorsal artery sometimes arises with the superior cervical by\r\n  a common trunk. On the right side there may be a common stem for the\r\n  dorsal, superior cervical, and vertebral arteries. Occasionally the\r\n  artery arises from the anterior aorta. Sometimes it emerges through\r\n  the third space. The subcostal may arise independently behind the\r\n  dorsal or from the superior cervical artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The =superior= or =deep cervical artery= (A. cervicalis profunda)\r\narises in front of the dorsal or by a common trunk with it. It crosses\r\nthe œsophagus (left side), the trachea (right side), and the longus\r\ncolli, and emerges from the thoracic cavity by passing through the space\r\nbehind the first costo-transverse articulation. In the thorax it gives\r\noff a small branch (A. mediastini cranialis) to the mediastinum and the\r\npericardium; also the first intercostal artery (A. intercostalis prima),\r\na very small vessel which passes down in the first intercostal space.\r\nAfter leaving the thorax the artery passes upward and forward on the\r\nspinalis muscle and the lamellar part of the ligamentum nuchæ, covered\r\nby the complexus. Its terminal branches anastomose with branches of the\r\noccipital and vertebral arteries in the region of the axis. Numerous\r\ncollateral branches are detached to the extensor muscles of the head and\r\nneck, the ligamentum nuchæ, and the skin, and anastomoses occur with the\r\ndorsal artery above and the vertebral artery below.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The artery sometimes emerges through the second intercostal space.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 430.—VERTEBRAL ARTERY OF HORSE. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat.\r\n    d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n3. The =vertebral artery= (A. vertebralis) arises from the brachial (or\r\nbrachiocephalic) opposite the first intercostal space and passes upward\r\nand forward. On the left side it crosses the œsophagus, on the right the\r\ntrachea. Emerging from the thorax it passes between the longus colli\r\ninternally and the scalenus externally, under the transverse process of\r\nthe seventh cervical vertebra, and continues along the neck through the\r\nseries of foramina transversaria, between which it is covered by the\r\nintertransversales colli. Emerging from the foramen of the axis, it\r\ncrosses the capsule of the atlanto-axial joint, and joins the retrograde\r\nbranch of the occipital artery under cover of the great oblique muscle\r\nof the head. At each intervertebral foramen a =spinal branch= (Ramus\r\nspinalis) is given off which enters the vertebral canal and reinforces\r\nthe ventral spinal artery. It also gives off series of dorsal and\r\nventral =muscular branches= (Rami musculares). The dorsal branches are\r\nthe larger; they supply the deep extensor muscles of the head and neck,\r\nand anastomose with the deep cervical and occipital arteries. The\r\nventral branches supply chiefly the scalenus, longus colli,\r\nintertransversales, and rectus capitis anterior major. The artery is\r\naccompanied by the vertebral vein and a sympathetic nerve-trunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases the last cervical transverse process has a foramen\r\n  transversarium, through which the artery passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The =internal thoracic artery= (A. thoracica s. mammaria interna) is\r\na large vessel which arises from the ventral side of the brachial\r\nopposite the first rib. It curves downward and backward, being at first\r\non the inner surface of the rib, and then crosses the lower part of the\r\nfirst intercostal space and passes under the transversus thoracis\r\nmuscle. It runs backward under cover of that muscle over the\r\nchondro-sternal joints to the eighth costal cartilage, where it divides\r\ninto asternal and anterior abdominal branches. At each intercostal space\r\ntwo collateral branches are detached. The =intercostal branches= (Rami\r\nintercostales) pass upward in the intercostal spaces and anastomose with\r\nhomonymous descending arteries. The lower branches detach small twigs to\r\nthe transversus thoracis, pleura, and pericardium, and pass out between\r\nthe costal cartilages as =perforating branches= (Rami perforantes) to\r\nsupply the pectoral muscles and skin, anastomosing with the external\r\nthoracic artery. A very small pericardiaco-phrenic artery ascends in the\r\nmediastinum on the left side, in the caval fold of pleura on the right\r\nside; it supplies fine twigs to the pericardium and pleura and\r\naccompanies the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm. In the young subject it\r\ngives small branches (Aa. thymicæ) to the thymus gland. The =asternal\r\nartery= (A. musculophrenica) passes along the ninth costal cartilage and\r\ncontinues along the costal attachment of the transversus abdominis (Fig.\r\n185). It gives off intercostal branches which anastomose with those\r\ndescending from the thoracic aorta, and twigs to the diaphragm and\r\ntransversus abdominis. The =anterior abdominal artery= (A. epigastrica\r\ncranialis) is the direct continuation of the internal thoracic. It\r\npasses between the ninth costal cartilage and the xiphoid cartilage,\r\nruns backward on the abdominal surface of the rectus abdominis and then\r\nbecomes embedded in it (Fig. 466). It supplies the ventral wall of the\r\nabdomen and anastomoses with the posterior abdominal artery.\r\n\r\n5. The =external thoracic artery= (A. thoracica externa) is given off\r\nfrom the ventral aspect of the brachial, usually at the inner surface or\r\nanterior border of the first rib. It turns around the first rib below or\r\nbehind the brachial vein (when given off within the thorax) and passes\r\nbackward under the deep pectoral muscle; it is continued as a small\r\nvessel in the panniculus carnosus, where it accompanies the external\r\nthoracic (“spur”) vein. It sends branches to the pectoral muscles and\r\nthe axillary lymph glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This artery varies in origin and size. Not rarely it arises from the\r\n  internal thoracic or from the brachial outside of the thorax. In other\r\n  cases it arises by a common trunk with the inferior cervical. It may\r\n  be very small or even absent, in which case the perforating branches\r\n  of the internal thoracic compensate.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The =inferior cervical artery= (Truncus omo-cervicalis) arises\r\nusually from the dorsal surface of the brachial opposite the first rib\r\nor where that vessel winds around the rib. It is directed downward and a\r\nlittle forward across the external surface of the jugular vein and the\r\ndeep face of the scalenus among the lymph glands at the thoracic inlet,\r\nand divides into ascending and descending branches. The =ascending\r\nbranch= (A. cervicalis ascendens) passes upward and forward along the\r\nexternal surface of the jugular vein, then turns sharply backward and\r\nruns upward along the anterior border of the anterior deep pectoral\r\nmuscle, between the omo-hyoideus and mastoido-humeralis and in relation\r\nto the prescapular lymph glands; it gives branches to these muscles and\r\nthe prepectoral and prescapular lymph glands. The =descending branch=\r\n(A. transversa scapulæ) passes downward and outward across the surface\r\nof the anterior deep pectoral and then runs in the groove between that\r\nmuscle and the mastoido-humeralis in company with the cephalic vein.

This stem, the =truncus\r\nbicaroticus= or =cephalic artery=, is detached from the inner face of\r\nthe brachiocephalic opposite the first rib and passes forward in the\r\nmedian plane beneath the trachea. It is related ventrally to the\r\nprepectoral lymph glands, the terminal parts of the jugular veins, and\r\nthe anterior vena cava, and laterally to the vagus and recurrent nerves.\r\nIt is commonly two or three inches (ca. 5 to 7 cm.) in length, but it\r\nmay vary between one and eight inches (ca. 2.5 to 20 cm.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 431.—VESSELS AND NERVES OF NECK OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Mastoido-humeralis; _b_, sterno-cephalicus; _c_, omo-hyoideus;\r\n    _d_, sterno-thyro-hyoideus; _e_, trachea; _f_, position of\r\n    cariniform cartilage; _g_, anterior superficial pectoral muscle;\r\n    _h_, scalenus; _i_, intertransversales; _k_, insertion of serratus\r\n    cervicis; _l_, origin of trapezius; _m_, rhomboideus; _n_, splenius;\r\n    _o_, complexus; _p_, _q_, trachelo-mastoideus; _p′_, _q′_, tendons\r\n    of same; _r_, longissimus; _s_, obliquus capitis posterior; _t_,\r\n    wing of atlas; _u_, parotid gland; _v_, supraspinatus; _w_, anterior\r\n    deep pectoral; _x_, spine of scapula; _y_, prescapular lymph glands;\r\n    _1_, external maxillary vein; _2_, _3_, jugular vein; _4_, carotid\r\n    artery, exposed by drawing jugular vein aside; _5_, _6_, ascending\r\n    and descending branches of inferior cervical artery; _7_, cephalic\r\n    vein; _8_, branches of superior or deep cervical artery; _9–14_,\r\n    ventral branches of second to seventh cervical nerves; _15_,\r\n    branches of dorsal divisions of cervical nerves. (Ellenberger-Baum,\r\n    Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =right common carotid artery= passes obliquely from the ventral face\r\nof the trachea to its right side. In this position it runs upward and\r\nforward and divides at the crico-pharyngeus muscle and under the\r\nsubmaxillary gland into external carotid, internal carotid, and\r\noccipital arteries. It is inclosed in a fibrous sheath, and is\r\naccompanied dorsally by the vagus and sympathetic nerves, ventrally by\r\nthe recurrent nerve. At the last two cervical vertebræ it is in contact\r\nsuperficially with the jugular vein, but further forward the\r\nomo-hyoideus muscle intervenes between the artery and vein. Near its\r\ntermination the artery becomes more deeply placed and is related\r\nexternally to the submaxillary and parotid glands, internally to the\r\nœsophagus. In some cases it is in contact ventrally with the thyroid\r\ngland, especially when the latter is larger than usual.\r\n\r\nThe =left common carotid artery= differs from the right one in that it\r\nis related deeply to the œsophagus, which separates it from the trachea\r\nin the greater part of its course.\r\n\r\nThe collateral branches of the common carotids are in the main small.\r\nThey comprise:\r\n\r\n1. =Muscular branches= (Rami musculares) of variable size, which go to\r\nthe ventral muscles of the neck and the skin.\r\n\r\n2. =Œsophageal= and =tracheal branches= (Rami œsophagei et tracheales).\r\nSmall twigs go to the cervical lymph glands also.\r\n\r\n3. The =parotid artery=. This comes off near the termination and enters\r\nthe ventral part of the parotid gland. It also supplies the subparotid\r\nlymph glands, and sometimes sends a branch to the submaxillary gland. It\r\nis inconstant.\r\n\r\n4. The =thyro-laryngeal artery= (A. thyreoidea cranialis). This, the\r\nlargest collateral branch of the carotid, arises from the latter two or\r\nthree inches before it divides. It curves over the anterior end of the\r\nthyroid gland, into which it sends several branches. It gives off a\r\n=laryngeal branch= (A. laryngea), which sends twigs to the external\r\nmuscles of the larynx and the constrictors of the pharynx, passes\r\nbetween the cricoid and thyroid cartilages, and supplies the internal\r\nmuscles and the mucous membrane of the larynx. A small =pharyngeal\r\nbranch= (A. pharyngea ascendens) runs upward and forward to the\r\ncrico-pharyngeus, and supplies twigs to the posterior part of the\r\npharynx and the origin of the œsophagus. Small innominate twigs are\r\ngiven off to the trachea, the œsophagus, and the sterno-thyro-hyoideus\r\nand omo-hyoideus muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases the thyroid and laryngeal arteries arise from the\r\n  carotid separately or by a short common stem. A laryngeal branch is\r\n  often detached from the carotid in front of the thyro-laryngeal and\r\n  enters the larynx with the superior laryngeal nerve. The pharyngeal\r\n  branch frequently comes directly from the carotid.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 432.—CROSS-SECTION OF NECK OF HORSE, PASSING THROUGH FIFTH\r\n    CERVICAL VERTEBRA; ANTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Branches of cervical nerves; _a′_, nuchal fat; _b_,\r\n    intertransversalis muscle; _c_, longissimus muscle; _d_, vertebral\r\n    artery; _e_, vertebral vein; _f_, vertebral nerve; _g_, spinal\r\n    accessory nerve (upper division); _h_, recurrent nerve; _i_,\r\n    vago-sympathetic trunk; _k_, tracheal lymph duct; _l_, body of fifth\r\n    cervical vertebra; _l′_, transverse process of same; _m_, carotid\r\n    artery; _n_, jugular vein; _o_, superior cervical artery; _o′_,\r\n    satellite vein of _o_; _p_, spinal cord; _q_, dura mater; _r_,\r\n    spinal vein; _s_, ligamentum nuchæ; _t_, rhomboideus muscle; _u_,\r\n    splenius; _v_, complexus; _w_, multifidus; _x_, serratus cervicis;\r\n    _y_, mastoido-humeralis; _z_, sterno-cephalicus; _1_, rectus capitis\r\n    ant. major; _2_, omo-hyoideus; _3_, panniculus; _4_,\r\n    sterno-thyro-hyoideus; _5_, longus colli; _6_, _7_,\r\n    trachelo-mastoideus; _8_, trapezius; _9_, spinalis; _10_, œsophagus;\r\n    _11_, trachea, with cartilaginous ring (_11′_), mucous membrane\r\n    (_11″_), and muscular layer (_11‴_).

The =accessory thyroid artery= (A. thyreoidea caudalis) is an\r\ninconstant vessel which arises from the carotid at a variable distance\r\nbehind the thyro-laryngeal—sometimes from the latter or from the parotid\r\nartery. It sends branches into the posterior part of the thyroid gland\r\nand detaches small tracheal and muscular twigs. In some cases it is\r\ndistributed chiefly or entirely to the adjacent muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE OCCIPITAL ARTERY\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 433.—DEEP DISSECTION OF NECK OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, _a_, Ends of sterno-cephalicus; _b_, anterior part of\r\n    omo-hyoideus; _c_, sterno-thyro-hyoideus; _d_, trachea; _e_,\r\n    œsophagus; _f_, cariniform cartilage; _g_, rectus cap. ant. major;\r\n    _h_, stump of trachelo-mastoideus; _i_, intertransversales; _k_,\r\n    multifidus; _l_, _m_, scalenus; _n_, serratus cervicis; _o_, _o_,\r\n    stumps of splenius, _p_, longissimus, _q_, complexus (most of which\r\n    is removed); _r_, rhomboideus; _s_, trapezius; _t_, spinalis et\r\n    semispinalis; _u_, lamellar part of lig. nuchæ; _v_,\r\n    mastoido-humeralis; _w_, anterior deep pectoral; _x_, supraspinatus;\r\n    _y_, anterior superficial pectoral; _z_, scapular tuberosity; _1_,\r\n    _1_, articular processes of cervical vertebræ; _2_, _2_, transverse\r\n    processes of same; _3_, atlas; _3′_, axis; _4_, _4_, jugular vein\r\n    (remainder removed); _5_, common carotid artery, from which a piece\r\n    is removed to show the accompanying nerves; _6_, vago-sympathetic\r\n    trunk; _7_, _7_, tracheal and muscular branches of carotid artery;\r\n    _8_, recurrent nerve; _10_, left tracheal lymph duct; _11_, _12_,\r\n    ascending and descending branches of inferior cervical artery\r\n    (_13_); _14_, cephalic vein; _15–20_, ventral branches of second to\r\n    seventh cervical nerves; _21_, roots of phrenic nerve; _22_,\r\n    thoracic or pectoral nerves; _22′_, nerve to serratus magnus; _23_,\r\n    musculo-cutaneous nerve; _24_, median nerve; _25_, ulnar nerve;\r\n    _26_, radial nerve; _27_, axillary nerve; _28_, dorsal branches of\r\n    cervical nerves; _28′_, accessory nerve (cut); _29_, superior or\r\n    deep cervical artery; _30_, muscular branch of vertebral artery;\r\n    _31_, posterior (anastomotic) branch of occipital artery; _32_,\r\n    vertebral artery; _33_, muscular branches of occipital artery; _34_,\r\n    obliquus capitis post.; _35_, obi. cap. ant.; _36_, twig from dorsal\r\n    branch of third cervical nerve. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat.\r\n    des Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =occipital artery= (A. occipitalis) is the second in size of the\r\nterminals of the carotid. It arises usually just in front of the\r\ninternal carotid, but in some cases with that artery by a common trunk\r\nof variable length. It pursues a somewhat flexuous course to the fossa\r\natlantis, where it divides into anterior and posterior branches. It is\r\nrelated superficially to the submaxillary gland and the\r\nmastoido-humeralis, and deeply to the guttural pouch and the rectus\r\ncapitis anterior major.[158] The internal carotid artery, the inferior\r\ncerebral vein, and the accessory, vagus, and sympathetic nerves cross\r\nits deep face. It gives twigs to the submaxillary gland, the anterior\r\nstraight muscles, the guttural pouch and the adjacent lymph glands, and\r\ntwo named collateral branches. The =condyloid= or =prevertebral artery=\r\n(A. condyloidea) is a small vessel which passes upward and forward on\r\nthe guttural pouch, and divides into muscular and meningeal branches.\r\nThe latter enter the cranium through the foramen lacerum and hypoglossal\r\nforamen and are distributed to the dura mater. This artery is very\r\nvariable in its origin. The =posterior meningeal= or =mastoid artery=\r\n(A. meningea caudalis) is a much larger vessel which runs upward and\r\nforward between the small oblique muscle and the paramastoid process,\r\npasses through the mastoid foramen into the parieto-temporal canal,\r\nenters the cranial cavity, and is distributed to the dura mater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 434.—VESSELS AND NERVES OF BASE OF BRAIN OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _13_, Cerebro-spinal artery; _14_, middle spinal artery; _15_, basilar\r\n    artery; _16_, posterior cerebellar artery; _17_, anterior cerebellar\r\n    artery; _18_, internal auditory artery; _19_, posterior cerebral\r\n    artery; _20_, deep cerebral artery; _21_, stump of internal carotid\r\n    artery; _22_, anterior choroid artery; _23_, anterior meningeal\r\n    artery; _24_, middle cerebral artery; _25_, artery of corpus\r\n    callosum; _26_, anterior communicating artery; _1_, _1′_, _1″_,\r\n    olfactory tracts; _1‴_, olfactory peduncle; _2–12_, cranial nerves;\r\n    _a_, olfactory bulb; _b_, trigonum olfactorium; _c_, lamina\r\n    perforata anterior; _d_, fossa transversa; _e_, pyriform lobe; _f_,\r\n    cerebral peduncle; _g_, tractus transversus; _h_, corpus mammillare;\r\n    _i_, tuber cinereum; _k_, lateral fissure (of Sylvius); _l_,\r\n    presylvian fissure; _m_, pons; _o_, pyramid; _p_, facial eminence;\r\n    _q_, corpus restiforme; _r_, cerebellum; _s_, middle peduncle of\r\n    cerebellum. (After Ellenberger Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =posterior= or =retrograde branch= (Ramus descendens) of the\r\noccipital passes up through the foramen transversarium of the atlas and\r\njoins the vertebral artery. It gives branches to the great oblique\r\nmuscle of the head, which covers it.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior= or =occipital branch= (Ramus occipitalis) passes through\r\nthe alar (antero-external) foramen of the atlas and supplies the muscles\r\nand skin of the poll, anastomosing with the deep cervical artery and its\r\nfellow of the opposite side. In the alar furrow it gives off the\r\n=cerebrospinal artery=, which enters the spinal canal through the\r\nintervertebral (antero-internal) foramen of the atlas, perforates the\r\ndura mater, and divides into cerebral and spinal branches. The =cerebral\r\nbranch= unites with that of the opposite side to form the =basilar\r\nartery=, and the =spinal branch= similarly forms by union with its\r\nfellow the =middle spinal artery=.\r\n\r\nThe =basilar artery= (A. basilaris cerebri) passes forward in the median\r\ngroove on the ventral surface of the medulla and pons and divides into\r\nthe two posterior cerebral arteries. The collateral branches of the\r\nbasilar are:\r\n\r\n1. Medullary branches (Rami medullares), ten or twelve in number,\r\ndistributed to the medulla oblongata.\r\n\r\n2. Posterior cerebellar arteries (Aa. cerebelli caudales) which pass\r\noutward around the medulla behind the pons to the cerebellum, to which\r\nthey are distributed after giving twigs to the medulla and pons.\r\n\r\n3. The small auditory artery (A. auditiva interna) accompanies the\r\neighth nerve to the internal ear. It often arises from the posterior\r\ncerebellar.\r\n\r\n4. Anterior cerebellar arteries (Aa. cerebelli nasales). These are very\r\nvariable in number and origin. There are often two or three on either\r\nside and they frequently arise from the posterior cerebrals. They pass\r\noutward in front of the pons and supply the anterior part of the\r\ncerebellum.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior cerebral arteries= (Aa. communicantes caudales) diverge\r\nat an acute angle and join the posterior communicating branches of the\r\ninternal carotid arteries on the inferior surface of the cerebral\r\npeduncles. They are connected by a transverse branch and by a network of\r\nfine twigs which form often a rete mirabile.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY (Figs. 434, 436, 437)\r\n\r\nThis artery (A. carotis interna) is somewhat smaller than the occipital.\r\nIt usually arises just behind that artery, crosses its deep face, and\r\nruns upward and forward on the guttural pouch to the foramen lacerum. It\r\nis closely related to the vagus nerve and the superior cervical ganglion\r\nof the sympathetic nerve, fibers from which accompany it. It is crossed\r\nexternally by the ninth and twelfth cranial nerves and the pharyngeal\r\nbranch of the vagus. It passes through the inferior petrosal sinus and\r\nenters the cavernous sinus, within which it forms an =S=-shaped curve.\r\nIt is connected with the opposite artery by a transverse branch (A.\r\nintercarotica), which lies behind the pituitary body in the\r\nintercavernous sinus. A branch (A. caroticobasilaris) sometimes connects\r\nit with the basilar artery. It then perforates the dura mater, gives off\r\nthe posterior communicating branch, and passes forward and divides at\r\nthe side of the optic chiasma into anterior and middle cerebral\r\narteries.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior communicating artery= (A. communicans posterior) turns\r\nbackward and joins the posterior cerebral. It gives off the =deep\r\ncerebral artery= (A. cerebri profunda) which winds around the cerebral\r\npeduncle and is distributed chiefly to the mid-brain. A smaller\r\ncollateral branch is the anterior choroid artery (A. chorioidea nasalis)\r\nwhich passes along the optic tract and is distributed in the choroid\r\nplexus of the lateral ventricle.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior cerebral artery= (A. cerebri anterior) unites with the\r\ncorresponding branch of the opposite artery above the optic chiasma.\r\nFrom this junction proceeds the =artery of the corpus callosum= (A.\r\ncorporis callosi), which turns around the genu of the corpus callosum,\r\nenters the great longitudinal fissure, divides into two branches, and is\r\ndistributed to the inner aspect of the cerebral hemispheres. A small\r\n=anterior meningeal= branch (A. meningea nasalis) of the anterior\r\ncerebral is distributed to the anterior part of the dura, and assists in\r\nforming a network in the ethmoidal fossa (Rete ethmoidale), anastomosing\r\nwith the ethmoidal branch of the ophthalmic artery.\r\n\r\nThe =middle cerebral artery= (A. cerebri media) passes outward in the\r\nlateral fissure (of Sylvius) and divides into branches on the outer\r\nsurface of the hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe =arterial circle of Willis= (Circulus arteriosus) (Fig. 434) is\r\nformed at the interpeduncular space of the base of the brain by the\r\nunion of the anterior cerebral arteries in front, by the diverging\r\nposterior cerebral arteries behind, and is completed laterally by the\r\njunction of the latter with the posterior communicating arteries and by\r\nthe internal carotid. It is irregularly polygonal in outline.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The cerebral arteries are very variable in arrangement, and the\r\n  foregoing account is a brief statement of the more usual disposition\r\n  of the larger vessels. The internal carotid artery often arises with\r\n  the occipital by a common trunk of variable length.\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY (Figs. 436, 437)\r\n\r\nThis artery (A. carotis externa) by its size and direction constitutes\r\nthe continuation of the common carotid. It passes forward on the lateral\r\nwall of the pharynx at the lower border of the guttural pouch, covered\r\nby the submaxillary gland and the stylo-maxillaris, digastricus, and\r\nstylo-hyoideus muscles. It then emerges between the stylo-hyoideus and\r\nthe great cornu of the hyoid bone, passes upward on the latter parallel\r\nwith the posterior border of the lower jaw, and terminates about two\r\ninches (ca. 5 cm.) below the temporo-maxillary articulation by dividing\r\ninto superficial temporal and internal maxillary branches. It is crossed\r\ndeeply near its origin by the superior laryngeal and pharyngeal branches\r\nof the vagus nerve. Just before its emergence its superficial face is\r\ncrossed by the hypoglossal nerve, and the glosso-pharyngeal nerve passes\r\nover its inner surface at the ventral border of the great cornu. The\r\nchief collateral branches are the masseteric, external maxillary, and\r\nposterior auricular. It also furnishes variable branches to the\r\nsubmaxillary and parotid glands, the guttural pouch, and the pharyngeal\r\nlymph glands, as well as twigs to some adjacent muscles.\r\n\r\n1. The =inferior masseteric= or maxillo-muscular artery (A. masseterica\r\ninferior) is given off from the external carotid at its emergence from\r\nbeneath the stylo-hyoideus. It passes downward and slightly forward\r\nunder cover of the parotid gland and over the tendon of insertion of the\r\nsterno-cephalicus to the posterior border of the mandible and appears on\r\nthe masseter muscle, into which it plunges after a short course on its\r\nsurface. It gives branches also to the internal pterygoid and\r\nstylo-maxillaris muscles and the parotid gland.\r\n\r\n2. The =external maxillary=, =facial=, or =submaxillary artery= (A.\r\nmaxillaris externa)[159] arises from the external carotid on the inner\r\nsurface of the posterior belly of the digastricus (Fig. 436). It runs\r\ndownward and forward on the lateral wall of the pharynx across the deep\r\nface of the stylo-hyoideus toward the great cornu of the hyoid bone,\r\naccompanied by the glosso-pharyngeal nerve in front and the hypoglossal\r\nnerve behind. After giving off the lingual artery at the posterior\r\nborder of the great cornu, it inclines more ventrally on the inner\r\nsurface of the internal pterygoid muscle, crosses over the hyo-glossus\r\nmuscle, the hypoglossal nerve, the submaxillary duct, and the\r\nintermediate tendon of the digastricus, and turns forward in the\r\nsubmaxillary space. Here it lies on the lower part of the internal\r\npterygoid muscle, and is related internally to the submaxillary lymph\r\nglands, above to the anterior belly of the digastricus, and below to the\r\nhomonymous vein. At the anterior border of the masseter it turns around\r\nthe lower border of the jaw and runs upward on the face in front of that\r\nmuscle.[160] At the turn the artery is in front, the vein in the middle,\r\nand the parotid duct posterior. The artery and vein pass upward along\r\nthe anterior border of the masseter, under cover of the facial\r\npanniculus and the zygomaticus, and are crossed superficially by\r\nbranches of the facial nerve and deeply by the parotid duct. The artery\r\nterminates over the levator labii superioris proprius by dividing into\r\nthe dorsal nasal and the angular artery of the eye. The chief branches\r\nof the external maxillary are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The =pharyngeal artery= (A. palatina ascendens) arises usually\r\nbehind the stylo-pharyngeus, passes between that muscle and the great\r\ncornu, and runs forward on the lateral wall of the pharynx under the\r\nelastic pharyngeal fascia. It is distributed to the soft palate,\r\npharynx, and tonsil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 435.—SUPERFICIAL DISSECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE.

It then passes across the kerato-hyoideus, turns inward under\r\nthe intercornual joint of the hyoid bone, and runs forward in the tongue\r\nbetween the hyo-glossus and genio-glossus. This part (A. profunda\r\nlinguæ) is flexuous and is accompanied by branches of the hypoglossal\r\nand lingual nerves. It is the chief artery of the tongue, and\r\nanastomoses with the opposite artery and the sublingual.\r\n\r\n(3) The =sublingual artery= (A. sublingualis) is a smaller vessel which\r\narises at the anterior extremity of the submaxillary gland (Fig. 436).\r\nIt passes forward on the anterior belly of the digastricus between the\r\nramus of the mandible and the mylo-hyoideus, perforates the latter, runs\r\nalong the lower border of the sublingual gland, and ramifies in the\r\nmucous membrane of the anterior part of the floor of the mouth. It\r\ndetaches branches to the muscles and skin in the submaxillary space, the\r\nsubmaxillary lymph glands, and the sublingual gland. It also gives off\r\nthe small =submental artery=, which runs forward superficially toward\r\nthe lower lip, supplying twigs to the skin and the mylo-hyoideus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 436.—PAROTID, MASSETERIC, AND LINGUAL REGIONS OF HORSE: DEEP\r\n    DISSECTION, THIRD LAYER.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Mylo-hyoideus, anterior part, reflected; _b_, genio-hyoideus;\r\n    _c_, genio-glossus; _d_, sublingual gland; _e_, ramus of mandible,\r\n    the greater part of which is removed; _e′_, stump of masseter; _f_,\r\n    maxillary tuberosity; _g_, great cornu of hyoid bone; _h_, wing of\r\n    atlas; _i_, intermediate tendon of digastricus; _i′_, anterior\r\n    belly, _i″_, posterior belly of digastricus; _k_, posterior part of\r\n    mylo-hyoideus; _l_, hyo-glossus; _m_, pterygoideus internus (cut);\r\n    _n_, stylo-hyoideus; _o_, stylo-maxillaris (cut); _p_,\r\n    crico-pharyngeus; _q_, obliquus capitis ant.; _r_, tendon of\r\n    trachelo-mastoideus; _s_, rectus cap. ant. major; _t_,\r\n    mastoido-humeralis (cut); _u_, sterno-cephalicus (cut); _v_,\r\n    sterno-thyroideus (cut); _w_, sterno-hyoideus (cut); _x_,\r\n    omo-hyoideus; _y_, obliquus cap. post.; _z_, splenius (cut); _1–4_,\r\n    upper cheek teeth; _4′_, last cheek tooth; _5_, stump of facial\r\n    nerve; _6_, stump of buccinator nerve; _7_, lingual nerve; _7′_,\r\n    superficial branch, _7″_, deep branch of lingual nerve; _8_, stumps\r\n    of inferior alveolar artery, vein and nerve; _9_, mylo-hyoid nerve\r\n    (cut); _10_, glosso-pharyngeal nerve; _11_, hypoglossal nerve; _12_,\r\n    superior laryngeal nerve; _13_, ventral branch of first cervical\r\n    nerve; _14_, vagus and sympathetic; _15_, dorsal branch of spinal\r\n    accessory nerve; _16_, ventral branch of same; _17_, inferior\r\n    cerebral vein; _18_, submaxillary duct; _19_, common carotid artery;\r\n    _20_, parotid branch; _21_, thyro-laryngeal artery; _22_, pharyngeal\r\n    artery; _23_, laryngeal artery; _24_, internal carotid artery; _25_,\r\n    occipital artery; _26_, external carotid artery; _27–31_, external\r\n    maxillary artery; _28_, posterior palatine artery; _29_, lingual\r\n    artery; _30_, sublingual artery; _32_, internal maxillary artery;\r\n    _33_, internal maxillary vein (origin); _34_, remnant of parotid\r\n    gland; _35_, thyroid gland; _36_, jugular vein; _37_, pharyngeal\r\n    lymph glands. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases the sublingual artery arises from the lingual and the\r\n  submental from the external maxillary. Sometimes the sublingual\r\n  remains on the external face of the mylo-hyoideus—thus resembling the\r\n  submental of man—and the sublingual gland is supplied by a special\r\n  branch of the lingual.\r\n\r\n  Not uncommonly a considerable branch, given off in the submaxillary\r\n  space, turns round the lower border of the jaw and enters the middle\r\n  of the lower part of the masseter muscle. In some cases this artery is\r\n  of large size and its pulsation can be felt. It is accompanied by a\r\n  vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) The =inferior labial artery= (A. labialis inferior) arises from the\r\nfacial a little before it reaches the depressor labii inferioris (Fig.\r\n435). It passes forward, dips under the depressor muscle, and continues\r\nto the lower lip. It supplies branches to the muscles and skin in this\r\nregion, to the inferior buccal glands, the mucous membrane of the cheek,\r\nand the lower lip, anastomosing with the mental artery and the\r\ncorresponding vessels of the opposite side. It detaches a branch (A.\r\nanguli oris) to the angle of the mouth, which anastomoses with the\r\nsuperior labial.\r\n\r\n(5) The =superior labial artery= (A. labialis superior) arises from the\r\nfacial in front of the facial crest (Fig. 435). It passes forward under\r\nthe dilatator naris lateralis and levator nasolabialis to the upper lip,\r\ngives twigs to the upper part of the cheek and the lateral nasal region,\r\nand ramifies in the upper lip, anastomosing with the opposite artery and\r\nthe palato-labial.\r\n\r\n(6) The =lateral nasal artery= (A. lateralis nasi) arises usually a\r\nlittle above the preceding one, and runs forward parallel with it and\r\nunder the levator nasolabialis to the nostril (Fig. 435). It supplies\r\nbranches to the lateral nasal region and the nostril.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The vessel is often double. It may arise from the superior labial at\r\n  the point of bifurcation of the facial or with the dorsal nasal from\r\n  the infraorbital artery (as in the ox). In some cases it gives off a\r\n  dorsal nasal branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n(7) The =dorsal nasal artery= (A. dorsalis nasi) arises on the levator\r\nlabii superioris proprius and passes forward under the levator\r\nnasolabialis to the dorsum nasi (Fig. 435).\r\n\r\n(8) The =angular artery of the eye= (A. angularis oculi) runs toward the\r\ninternal canthus of the eye, where it anastomoses with the orbital\r\nbranch (Ramus malaris) of the infraorbital artery (Fig. 435).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the preceding, unnamed branches are supplied to the\r\nsubmaxillary salivary gland and the submaxillary lymph glands.\r\n\r\n3. The =posterior auricular artery= (A. auricularis posterior) arises at\r\nan acute angle from the external carotid just above the origin of the\r\nmasseteric. It passes upward under cover of the parotid gland, to which\r\nit gives branches, and divides into several branches which supply the\r\nskin and muscles of the external ear (Fig. 435). The =posterior branch=\r\npasses to the posterior part of the base of the ear, where it divides\r\ninto two branches; of these, one (Ramus intermedius) passes up the\r\nconvex surface of the external ear to the apex, while the other (Ramus\r\nmedialis) winds around to the anterior (inner) border, and forms an arch\r\nwith the intermediate branch. The =external branch= (Ramus lateralis)\r\npasses up the posterior (external) border of the ear and forms an arch\r\nwith the intermediate branch. The =deep branch= (A. auricularis\r\nprofunda) enters the interval between the external auditory canal and\r\nmastoid process, and passes through an opening into the interior of the\r\nexternal ear and ramifies in the skin which lines it. It gives off the\r\n=stylo-mastoid artery=, which passes through the stylo-mastoid foramen\r\ninto the tympanum, forms an arch around the membrana tympani, and\r\nsupplies the middle ear and its muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE SUPERFICIAL TEMPORAL ARTERY\r\n\r\nThis artery (A. temporalis superficialis) is much the smaller of the two\r\nterminal branches of the external carotid. It passes upward behind the\r\nposterior border of the ramus of the mandible under cover of the parotid\r\ngland, and divides below the level of the condyle into the anterior\r\nauricular and transverse facial arteries. It is crossed superficially by\r\nthe facial nerve.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior auricular artery= (A. auricularis anterior) passes upward\r\nbehind the temporo-mandibular articulation under cover of the parotid\r\ngland, crosses the zygomatic arch, and reaches the temporalis muscle. It\r\nis crossed deeply at its origin by the superficial temporal nerve and is\r\naccompanied by a satellite vein and the auriculo-palpebral branch of the\r\nfacial nerve. It is distributed to the skin and the temporal and\r\nanterior auricular muscles, and sends a branch through the conchal\r\ncartilage to the skin which lines it. Collateral twigs are detached to\r\nthe parotid gland, and an anterior branch anastomoses with the\r\nsupraorbital artery. A branch sometimes passes into the parieto-temporal\r\ncanal and anastomoses with the posterior meningeal (mastoid) artery.\r\n\r\nThe =transverse facial artery= (A. transversa faciei) is larger than the\r\npreceding. It turns around the neck below the condyle of the mandible\r\nand emerges from beneath the parotid gland (Fig. 435). It then passes\r\nforward a short distance on the masseter about half an inch below the\r\nzygomatic arch and plunges into the muscle, in which it commonly divides\r\ninto two chief branches. It is accompanied by a vein and a branch of the\r\nsuperficial temporal nerve. It supplies the masseter and the skin of\r\nthis region, and anastomoses with the external maxillary and posterior\r\ndeep temporal arteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 437.—DEEP DISSECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The left ramus of the mandible and structures connected with it have\r\n    been removed. _a_, _a_, Stumps of stylo-glossus; _b_, genio-glossus;\r\n    _c_, genio-hyoideus; _d_, omo-hyoideus; _e_, kerato-hyoideus; _f_,\r\n    thyro-hyoideus; _g_, thyro-pharyngeus; _h_, crico-thyroideus; _i_,\r\n    sterno-thyroideus; _k_, thyroid gland; _m_, crico-pharyngeus; _n_,\r\n    palatinus and palato-pharyngeus; _o_, pterygoideus externus; _p_,\r\n    tensor palati; _q_, levator palati; _r_, temporalis; _s_, rectus\r\n    cap. ant. major; _t_, obliquus cap. ant.; _u_, guttural pouch; _v_,\r\n    great cornu of hyoid bone, posterior extremity of which is removed\r\n    and indicated by dotted line; _w_, position of small cornu, dotted\r\n    line; _x_, thyroid cornu; _y_, tongue; _z_, anterior pillar of soft\r\n    palate; _1_, superficial temporal nerve; _2_, chorda tympani; _3_,\r\n    stump of inferior alveolar nerve; _4_, _4_, lingual nerve,\r\n    intermediate part removed; _5_, deep temporal nerve; _6_, masseteric\r\n    nerve; _7_, buccinator nerve; _8_, great palatine nerve; _9_,\r\n    infraorbital nerve; _10_, sphenopalatine and posterior nasal nerves;\r\n    _11_, spinal accessory nerve; _12_, vagus; _13_, pharyngeal branch\r\n    of vagus; _14_, superior laryngeal nerve; _15_, vago-sympathetic\r\n    trunk; _16_, sympathetic, with superior cervical ganglion a little\r\n    further back; _17_, glosso-pharyngeal nerve; _18_, pharyngeal and\r\n    _19_, lingual branches of glosso-pharyngeal; _20_, hypoglossal\r\n    nerve; _21_, left recurrent nerve; _22_, common carotid artery;\r\n    _23_, parotid branch; _24_, thyro-laryngeal artery; _24′_, laryngeal\r\n    artery; _25_, occipital artery; _26_, internal carotid artery; _27_,\r\n    external carotid artery; _28_, _30_, external maxillary artery;\r\n    _29_, pharyngeal artery; _31_, lingual artery; _32_, internal\r\n    maxillary artery; _33_, stump of inferior alveolar artery; _34_,\r\n    middle meningeal artery; _35_, deep temporal artery; _36_,\r\n    buccinator artery; _37_, palatine artery; _38_, end of internal\r\n    maxillary artery; _39_, right external maxillary artery; _40_,\r\n    satellite vein of _39_; _41_, right parotid duct; _42_, submaxillary\r\n    lymph glands; _43_, pharyngeal lymph glands; _44_, trachea; _45_,\r\n    wing of atlas; _46_, dotted line indicating outline of submaxillary\r\n    gland; _47_, lacrimal gland. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d.\r\n    Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The pulse may usually be felt in this artery as it passes below the\r\n  articulation of the jaw.\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE INTERNAL MAXILLARY ARTERY (Figs. 437, 438, 439)\r\n\r\nThis artery (A. maxillaris interna) is much the larger of the two\r\nterminal branches of the external carotid. It begins at the inner side\r\nof the posterior border of the mandible about two inches (ca. 5 cm.)\r\nbelow the articulation of the jaw and ends in the anterior part of the\r\npterygo-palatine fossa. On account of its complex course and the large\r\nnumber of branches given off it is convenient to divide it into three\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThe =first part= is much the longest, forms an =S=-shaped curve, and is\r\nin great part in contact with the guttural pouch. It passes upward and\r\nforward on the inner surface of the mandible a distance of about an inch\r\n(ca. 2 to 3 cm.) and is related here to the vein, which is ventral. It\r\nthen turns inward below the external pterygoid muscle and the inferior\r\nmaxillary nerve, passes between that muscle and the tensor palati, and\r\nruns forward to enter the alar (pterygoid) foramen. This part gives off\r\nthe following branches:\r\n\r\n1. The =inferior alveolar= or =dental artery= (A. alveolaris mandibulæ\r\ns. inferior) passes downward and forward with the homonymous vein and\r\nnerve, being at first between the external and internal pterygoid\r\nmuscles, then between the latter and the ramus of the mandible. It\r\nenters the mandibular foramen, passes downward and forward in the\r\nmandibular canal, and terminates at the mental foramen by dividing into\r\nmental and incisor branches. The =mental branch= (A. mentalis) emerges\r\nthrough the mental foramen and anastomoses in the lower lip with the\r\nopposite artery and the inferior labial. The =incisor branch= continues\r\nforward in the bone, supplies twigs to the canine and incisor teeth, and\r\nanastomoses with its fellow of the opposite side. Collateral branches\r\nare detached to the pterygoid and mylo-hyoid muscles, and within the\r\nbone to the teeth, alveolar periosteum, the gums, and the spongy\r\nsubstance of the mandible.\r\n\r\n2. The =pterygoid arteries=, two or three in number, are distributed to\r\nthe pterygoid and tensor and levator palati muscles.\r\n\r\n3. The =tympanic artery= is a very small vessel which passes along the\r\nEustachian tube to the petro-tympanic fissure (of Glaser) and enters the\r\nmiddle ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 438.—RIGHT EYE OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Remnants of periorbita; _b_, levator palpebræ superioris; _c_,\r\n    obliquus oculi inferior; _d_, rectus oculi inferior; _e_, rectus\r\n    oculi externus; _f_, rectus oculi superior; _g_, sclera; _g′_,\r\n    cornea; _h_, lacrimal gland; _i_, frontal nerve; _k_, frontal\r\n    artery; _l_, branch of lacrimal nerve to gland; _m_, lacrimal\r\n    artery; _n_, zygomatic nerve; _o_, branch of ophthalmic artery; _p_,\r\n    branch of oculomotor nerve to obliquus oculi inferior; _q_,\r\n    maxillary nerve; _r_, infraorbital nerve; _s_, posterior nasal\r\n    nerve; _t_, great palatine nerve; _u_, small palatine nerve; _v_,\r\n    internal maxillary artery; _w_, buccinator artery (cut); _x_,\r\n    infraorbital artery; _x′_, malar artery; _y_, sphenopalatine artery;\r\n    _z_, great palatine artery; _z′_, small palatine (or staphyline)\r\n    artery; _1_, posterior deep temporal artery; _2_, _3_, stumps of\r\n    orbital margin; _4_, facial crest; _5_, temporal fossa; _6_, foramen\r\n    lacerum orbitale; _7_, anterior end of alar canal; _8_, posterior\r\n    opening of same. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n4. The =middle meningeal artery= (A. meningea media) arises beneath the\r\nbuccinator nerve where the internal maxillary turns forward. It passes\r\nbackward across the temporal wing of the sphenoid to the antero-external\r\npart (foramen spinosum) of the foramen lacerum. Entering the cranium, it\r\ndivides into branches which course in the grooves on the temporal and\r\nparietal bones and supply the dura mater. It anastomoses with the\r\nposterior meningeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The size of this artery is variable, and is in inverse ratio to that\r\n  of the posterior meningeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The =posterior deep temporal artery= (A. temporalis profunda\r\naboralis) arises from the internal maxillary just before the latter\r\nenters the canal of the pterygoid process. It passes upward and backward\r\nin the temporal fossa on the deep face of the temporalis muscle, in\r\nwhich it ramifies. It sends a branch outward to the masseter, and\r\nanastomoses with the superficial temporal and middle meningeal arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases the tympanic and middle meningeal arise from this\r\n  artery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =second part= lies in the alar canal and is about an inch (ca. 2 to\r\n3 cm.) in length. It gives off two branches—the anterior deep temporal\r\nand the ophthalmic.\r\n\r\n1. The =anterior deep temporal artery= (A. temporalis profunda oralis)\r\nemerges from the canal through the temporal or small alar foramen, and\r\npasses upward in the anterior part of the temporal fossa on the deep\r\nface of the temporalis muscle, in which it is chiefly distributed. It\r\ngives twigs to the orbital fat and the skin of the frontal region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 439.—LEFT EYE OF HORSE, DEEPER DISSECTION.\r\n\r\n  The outer plate of bone has been removed behind the pterygoid crest to\r\n    expose the vessels and nerves. _a_, _a_, Remnants of periorbita;\r\n    _b_, stump of rectus oculi superior; _c_, obliquus oculi inferior;\r\n    _d_, rectus oculi inferior; _e_, rectus oculi lateralis; _e′_,\r\n    retractor oculi; _f_, rectus oculi internus; _g_, _g_, obliquus\r\n    oculi superior; _h_, eyeball; _i_, trochlear nerve; _k_, ophthalmic\r\n    nerve; _k′_, nasal nerve; _k″_, infratrochlear nerve; _k‴_,\r\n    ethmoidal nerve; _l_, optic nerve; _m_, frontal nerve; _n_, lacrimal\r\n    nerve; _o_, zygomatic nerve; _p_, nerve to obliquus inferior (from\r\n    oculomotor); _q_, maxillary nerve; _r_, infraorbital nerve; _s_,\r\n    sphenopalatine nerve; _t_, great palatine nerve; _u_, small palatine\r\n    nerve; _v_, internal maxillary artery; _w_, buccinator artery (cut\r\n    off); _x_, infraorbital artery; _x′_, malar artery; _y_,\r\n    sphenopalatine artery; _z_, great palatine artery; _z′_, small\r\n    palatine (or staphyline) artery; _1_, _2_, stumps of zygomatic arch;\r\n    _3_, stump of supraorbital process; _4_, facial crest; _5_, temporal\r\n    fossa; _6_, ophthalmic artery; _7_, muscular branch of _6_; _8_,\r\n    lacrimal artery (cut); _9_, frontal artery; _10_, anterior deep\r\n    temporal artery; _11_, ethmoidal artery.

The =ophthalmic artery= (A. ophthalmica externa) emerges from the\r\nanterior opening of the alar canal, and enters the apex of the\r\nperiorbita or ocular sheath. Within this it forms a semicircular bend\r\nunder the rectus oculi superior and is continued by the ethmoidal\r\nartery. Its branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =supraorbital= or =frontal artery= (A. supraorbitalis)[161] is\r\na small vessel which often arises from the anterior deep temporal or the\r\ninternal maxillary. It passes along the inner wall of the orbit in\r\ncompany with the nerve of the same name to the supraorbital foramen,\r\nthrough which it emerges. It is distributed to the orbicularis oculi,\r\nthe corrugator supercilii, and the skin of the supraorbital region.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =lacrimal artery= (A. lacrimalis) runs upward and forward\r\nwithin the periorbita along the outer edge of the levator palpebræ\r\nsuperioris to the lacrimal gland, in which it is chiefly distributed. It\r\nalso sends twigs to the upper eyelid.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Muscular branches= (Rami musculares) supply the orbital muscles,\r\nthe periorbita, the third eyelid, and the conjunctiva.\r\n\r\n(_d_) =Ciliary branches= (Aa. ciliares), two sets of very slender\r\narteries, arise from the ophthalmic direct and from the muscular\r\nbranches. The anterior ciliary arteries (Aa. ciliares anteriores) pierce\r\nthe sclera in front of the equator and ramify chiefly in the ciliary\r\nbody and the iris. The posterior ciliary arteries (Aa. ciliares\r\nposteriores) pierce the posterior part of the sclera; most of them\r\nramify in the choroid coat as the short ciliary arteries, but two of\r\nlarger size, the long ciliary arteries, run forward, one on each side,\r\nbetween the sclera and choroid to the periphery of the iris. Here they\r\ndivide into branches which anastomose and form a circle (Circulus iridis\r\nmajor). From this secondary branches are detached which form a second\r\ncircle around the pupil (Circulus iridis minor).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 440.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE, CUT A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT\r\n    OF THE MEDIAN PLANE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Skin; _2_, nasal bone; _3_, frontal bone; _4_, parietal bone;\r\n    _4′_, tentorium osseum; _5_, occipital bone; _6_, sphenoid bone;\r\n    _7_, hard palate; _8_, premaxilla; _9_, mandible; _10_, hyoid bone;\r\n    _11_, septum between frontal sinuses; _12_, alar cartilage; _13_,\r\n    dilatator naris transversus; _14_, septum nasi with venous plexuses;\r\n    _15_, palato-labial artery; _16_, _16′_, upper and lower septal\r\n    branches of _15_; _17_, septal branch of sphenopalatine artery and\r\n    satellite vein; _18_, septal branch of ethmoidal artery; _19_,\r\n    sphenoidal sinus; _20_, guttural pouch; _21_, pharynx; _22_,\r\n    pharyngeal orifice of Eustachian tube; _23_, posterior naris; _24_,\r\n    soft palate; _25_, palatinus muscle; _26_, pharyngeal muscles; _27_,\r\n    œsophagus; _28_, dotted line indicating position of posterior pillar\r\n    of soft palate; _29_, lamina; _29′_, arch of cricoid cartilage;\r\n    _30_, arytenoideus transversus muscle; _31_, epiglottis; _32_, body\r\n    of thyroid cartilage; _33_, vocal process and cord; _34_, arytenoid\r\n    cartilage; _35_, lateral ventricle of larynx; _36_, trachea; _37_,\r\n    ventral straight muscles of head; _38_, longus colli; _39_, atlas;\r\n    _40_, axis; _41_, lig. nuchæ; _42_, dorsal spinal muscles; _43_,\r\n    muscles of external ear; _44_, omo- and sterno-hyoideus; _45_,\r\n    tongue; _46_, mylo-hyoideus; _47_, genio-hyoideus; _48_,\r\n    genio-glossus; _49_, longitudinalis inferior; _50_, longitud.\r\n    superior; _51_, hyo-epiglotticus; _52_, chin and mentalis muscle;\r\n    _53_, venous plexus of hard palate; _54_, corpus callosum; _55_,\r\n    septum pellucidum; _56_, fornix; _57_, thalamus; _58_, pineal body;\r\n    _59_, corpora quadrigemina; _60_, cerebral peduncle; _61_, corpus\r\n    mammillare; _62_, pituitary body; _63_, chiasma opticum; _64_,\r\n    intercarotid artery; _65_, medulla oblongata; _66_, interventricular\r\n    foramen; _67_, infundibulum; _68_, third ventricle; _69_, cerebral\r\n    aqueduct; _70_, anterior medullary velum; _71_, fourth ventricle;\r\n    _72_, posterior medullary velum; _73_, basilar artery; _74_, spinal\r\n    cord; _75_, ethmoidal nerve; _76_, septal branch of posterior nasal\r\n    nerve; _76′_, branch of same to organ of Jacobson; _77_, olfactory\r\n    nerve to organ of Jacobson; _78_, nasal branches of palatine artery.\r\n    (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n(_e_) The =central artery of the retina= (Arteria centralis retinæ) is a\r\nsmall vessel which arises from the ophthalmic or from a posterior\r\nciliary artery. It pierces the optic nerve a short distance behind the\r\nsclera and runs in its center to the lamina cribrosa, where it breaks up\r\nin thirty to forty fine branches. These appear in the fundus of the eye\r\nat the margin of the optic papilla and radiate in the posterior part of\r\nthe retina.\r\n\r\n(_f_) The =ethmoidal artery= (A. ethmoidalis) is the continuation of the\r\nophthalmic. It enters the cranial cavity through the ethmoidal foramen,\r\npasses inward on the cribriform plate, and divides into meningeal and\r\nnasal branches. The former ramify in the anterior part of the dura mater\r\nand anastomose with branches of the artery of the corpus callosum. The\r\nnasal branch passes through the cribriform plate, gives branches to the\r\nmucous membrane of the lateral mass of the ethmoid and the adjacent part\r\nof the septum nasi, and runs forward on the superior turbinal.\r\n\r\nThe =third part= passes forward in the pterygo-palatine fossa,\r\naccompanied by branches of the maxillary nerve. On reaching the\r\nposterior palatine foramen it is continued by the palatine artery. Its\r\nbranches are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The =buccinator artery= (A. buccinatoria) arises from the lower\r\naspect of the internal maxillary shortly after its emergence (Fig. 437).\r\nIt turns around the maxillary tuberosity, accompanied by the buccinator\r\nnerve, and under the masseter muscle, enters the cheek, and runs forward\r\nin it. It supplies branches to the cheek, the superior buccal glands,\r\nand the masseter and pterygoid muscles. Near its origin it gives off a\r\nbranch to the orbital fat behind the periorbita.\r\n\r\n(2) The =infraorbital= or =superior dental artery= (A. infraorbitalis)\r\narises from the upper aspect of the internal maxillary a little in front\r\nof the preceding vessel. It passes upward and forward to the maxillary\r\nforamen, runs in the infraorbital canal in company with the nerve of the\r\nsame name, and is continued forward within the jaw to the incisor teeth.\r\nIt gives branches to the teeth and gums, and detaches a branch through\r\nthe infraorbital foramen which anastomoses with the lateral nasal and\r\nsuperior labial. About midway between its origin and the maxillary\r\nforamen it gives off the =malar= or =orbital branch= (Ramus malaris),\r\nwhich passes along the floor of the orbit to end in the lower lid and\r\nanastomose with the angularis oculi. It gives twigs to the inferior\r\noblique muscle and the lacrimal sac.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The infraorbital artery is usually small at its emergence upon the\r\n  face, but in some cases it is rather large and may partially replace\r\n  the superior labial and lateral nasal arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) The =staphyline= or =small palatine artery= (A. palatina minor) is a\r\nsmall vessel which passes forward in the groove at the inner side of the\r\nmaxillary tuberosity to the soft palate. In the groove it is accompanied\r\nby the nerve of the same name and the palatine vein.\r\n\r\n(4) The =sphenopalatine artery= (A. sphenopalatina) arises in the\r\nextreme anterior part of the pterygo-palatine fossa and passes into the\r\nnasal cavity, where it divides into internal and external branches. The\r\ninternal branch is distributed to the mucous membrane of the septum\r\nnasi; the external one goes to the inferior turbinal, the inferior\r\nmeatus, the posterior nares, and the maxillary and frontal sinuses. It\r\nmay arise from the infraorbital.\r\n\r\n(5) The =palatine= or =palato-labial artery= (A. palatina major) is the\r\ndirect continuation of the internal maxillary. It passes through the\r\npalatine canal to the roof of the mouth, accompanied by the palatine\r\nnerve, and runs forward in the palatine groove, where it is joined by\r\nthe vein. A little behind the plane of the corner incisor teeth it\r\ncurves inward over a bar of cartilage to the foramen incisivum, where it\r\nunites with its fellow of the opposite side. The single artery thus\r\nformed passes up through the foramen and divides under the transverse\r\ndilator of the nostril into two branches. These ramify in the upper lip\r\nand anastomose with the lateral nasal and superior labial arteries. In\r\nits course in the roof of the mouth the palatine artery gives off\r\nbranches to the hard and soft palate and the gums, and others which pass\r\nthrough the accessory palatine foramina to be distributed in the mucous\r\nmembrane of the lower part of the nasal cavity. Commonly two branches,\r\nright and left, are detached from the convexity of the arch formed by\r\nthe union of the two arteries; these run forward in the anterior part of\r\nthe hard palate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ARTERIES OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BRACHIAL ARTERY\r\n\r\nThe =brachial artery=, after turning around the lower border of the\r\nscalenus at the first rib, passes backward and a little downward across\r\nthe origin of the coraco-brachialis and the insertion of the\r\nsubscapularis muscle at the inner side of the shoulder joint. At the\r\nposterior border of the subscapularis it gives off the subscapular\r\nartery, and turns downward on the inner surface of the arm. In its\r\ncourse in the arm it inclines a little forward, crosses the humerus very\r\nobliquely, and divides at the antero-internal aspect of the distal third\r\nof the shaft of the bone into the anterior and posterior radial\r\narteries.[162]\r\n\r\nIt is related internally to the serratus magnus and the posterior deep\r\npectoral muscles, and the cubital lymph glands. Externally it lies on\r\nthe subscapularis, the brachialis, the insertion of the teres major and\r\nlatissimus dorsi, and the inner head of the triceps. The\r\ncoraco-brachialis muscle lies along the front of the artery, which,\r\nhowever, overlaps the muscle distally. The vein crosses the inner face\r\nof the artery and runs down behind it, accompanied part way by the ulnar\r\nand radial nerves. The musculo-cutaneous and median nerves form a loop\r\naround the artery close to its origin, and the latter nerve then passes\r\ndown in front of the artery. The chief branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =suprascapular artery= (A. thoracico-acromialis) is a small and\r\nsomewhat flexuous vessel, which arises near the anterior border of the\r\nsubscapularis, runs upward, and dips in between that muscle and the\r\nsupraspinatus. It gives branches to these muscles, the anterior deep\r\npectoral, and the mastoido-humeralis. A branch passes in front of the\r\ncoraco-brachialis to the shoulder joint and the proximal end of the\r\nhumerus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This vessel may be double, or be represented by one or more branches\r\n  of the inferior cervical artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The =subscapular artery= (A. subscapularis) is a very large vessel\r\nwhich arises at the posterior border of the subscapularis muscle. It\r\npasses upward in the interstice between that muscle and the teres major\r\non the inner surface of the long head of the triceps, turns around the\r\nposterior border of the scapula below the posterior angle, and ends in\r\nthe infraspinatus and deltoid. Besides collaterals (Rami musculares) to\r\nthe subscapularis, teres major, triceps, and tensor fasciæ antibrachii\r\nit gives off the following named branches:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =thoracico-dorsal= (A. thoracicodorsalis) is a long artery\r\nwhich is usually given off about an inch from the origin of the\r\nsubscapular, crosses the inner face of the teres major, and runs upward\r\nand backward on the latissimus dorsi. It gives branches to these\r\nmuscles, the abdominal panniculus and the axillary lymph glands.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =posterior circumflex artery= (A. circumflexa humeri\r\nposterior) arises a little above the preceding vessel and passes outward\r\nbehind the shoulder joint between the long and external heads of the\r\ntriceps with the axillary (or circumflex) nerve. It gives branches to\r\nthese muscles, the joint capsule, and the muscles and skin of the outer\r\nside of the shoulder, anastomosing with the anterior circumflex artery.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The =circumflex artery of the scapula= (A. circumflexa scapulæ)\r\narises about two or three inches (ca. 5 to 7.5 cm.) above the shoulder\r\njoint, passes forward to the posterior border of the scapula, and\r\ndivides into two branches. The outer one runs forward on the external\r\nsurface of the scapula below the spine and gives branches to the\r\nsupraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor. The inner branch passes\r\nforward in a similar fashion on the costal surface of the scapula and\r\nsupplies branches to the subscapularis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 441.—DISSECTION OF SHOULDER AND ARM OF HORSE, INNER SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  _A_, Brachial artery; _B_, subscapular artery; _C_, thoracico-dorsal\r\n    artery; _D_, deep brachial artery; _E_, ulnar artery; _F_, anterior\r\n    radial artery; _G_, posterior radial (or median) artery; _H_,\r\n    brachial vein; _I_, external thoracic (or “spur”) vein; _J_,\r\n    brachial vein; _K_, _K_, _K_, posterior radial veins; _L_, cephalic\r\n    vein; _L′_, communicating vein; _M_, brachialis muscle; _N_,\r\n    internal epicondyle of humerus; _O_, prescapular lymph glands; _P_,\r\n    position of axillary lymph glands; _Q_, position of cubital lymph\r\n    glands; _1_, suprascapular nerve; _2_, subscapular nerves; _3_,\r\n    thoraco-dorsal nerve; _4_, musculo-cutaneous nerve; _4′_, cutaneous\r\n    branch of musculo-cutaneous nerve; _5_, median nerve; _6_, axillary\r\n    nerve; _7_, ulnar nerve; _8_, radial nerve; _9_, thoracic nerves.\r\n    (After Schmaltz, Atlas d.

(After Schmaltz, Atlas\r\n    d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n3. The =anterior circumflex= (or prehumeral) =artery= (A. circumflexa\r\nhumeri anterior) arises usually at the upper border of the teres major.\r\nIt passes forward and outward between the two parts of the\r\ncoraco-brachialis or between the latter and the humerus. It gives\r\nbranches to the coraco-brachialis and deep pectoral and ends in the\r\nupper part of the biceps and in the mastoido-humeralis. It anastomoses\r\nwith the posterior circumflex.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Not rarely it arises below the middle of the humerus and passes upward\r\n  between the biceps and coraco-brachialis. In these cases a small\r\n  branch for the coraco-brachialis is usually given off at the usual\r\n  point of origin of the anterior circumflex.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The =deep brachial artery= (A. profunda brachii) is a large but short\r\ntrunk which arises usually about the middle of the humerus. It passes\r\nbackward and divides into several branches which supply the triceps,\r\ntensor fasciæ antibrachii, anconeus, and brachialis. A branch runs in\r\nthe musculo-spiral groove with the radial nerve to the front of the\r\nelbow joint and anastomoses with the anterior radial. A slender branch\r\npasses down along the external border of the extensor carpi and supplies\r\ncutaneous twigs. Anastomoses occur with the ulnar and recurrent\r\ninterosseous arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The point of origin is inconstant and it is not uncommon to find two\r\n  arteries instead. Often a large branch for the posterior deep pectoral\r\n  muscle is detached close to the origin or arises from the brachial\r\n  directly.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Muscular branches= (Rami musculares) are distributed to the teres\r\nmajor, deep pectoral, coraco-brachialis, and biceps. The largest and\r\nleast variable of these supplies the lower part of the biceps.\r\n\r\n6. The =ulnar artery= (A. collateralis ulnaris superior) arises a little\r\nbelow the nutrient foramen of the humerus and passes downward and\r\nbackward along the lower edge of the internal head of the triceps under\r\ncover of the brachial vein and the tensor fascia antibrachii. It gives\r\nbranches to these muscles, the posterior superficial pectoral, the\r\ncubital lymph glands, panniculus, and skin. At the internal epicondyle\r\nof the humerus it is joined by the ulnar nerve and turns downward under\r\nthe ulnar head of the flexor carpi medius. It continues with the vein\r\nand nerve under the deep fascia of the forearm between the ulnar and\r\nhumeral heads of the perforans, and in the distal half of the region\r\nbetween the external and middle flexors of the carpus. It unites just\r\nabove the carpus (under cover of the flexor carpi externus) with a\r\nbranch of the radial artery, with which it forms the supracarpal arch.\r\nIt detaches small collaterals to the muscles along which it passes and\r\nterminal twigs to the outer surface of the carpus.\r\n\r\n7. The =nutrient artery of the humerus= (A. nutritia humeri) is a short\r\nvessel which enters the nutrient foramen of the humerus. It often arises\r\nfrom the ulnar.\r\n\r\n8. The =anterior radial artery= (A. collateralis radialis inferior)\r\npasses downward and a little outward on the anterior face of the humerus\r\nunder cover of the biceps and brachialis to the front of the elbow\r\njoint, where it is joined by the radial nerve. It then descends on the\r\nanterior surface of the radius under cover of the anterior extensor of\r\nthe digit to the carpus, where it concurs in the formation of the rete\r\ncarpi dorsale, anastomosing with the posterior radial and interosseous\r\narteries. It supplies branches to the elbow joint, the biceps,\r\nbrachialis, and the extensors of the carpus and digit. A cutaneous\r\nbranch emerges between the distal end of the biceps and the brachialis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE POSTERIOR RADIAL ARTERY\r\n\r\nThe =posterior radial= or =median artery= (A. mediana) is the direct\r\ncontinuation of the brachial. It passes downward and slightly backward,\r\nat first on the inner surface of the humerus, and then over the capsule\r\nand internal lateral ligament of the elbow joint, under cover of the\r\nposterior superficial pectoral muscle.[163] Below the elbow it dips\r\nunder the flexor carpi internus and passes down the inner part of the\r\nposterior surface of the radius. In the distal part of the forearm it\r\ninclines backward and is separated from the radius by the reinforcing\r\nband (Caput tendineum) of the superficial flexor of the digit and is\r\ncontinued by the large metacarpal artery.\r\n\r\nIt is accompanied by the median nerve, which lies in front of the artery\r\nat its origin, then crosses over it obliquely at the elbow joint and\r\nbecomes posterior. In the arm the brachial vein lies behind and partly\r\nupon the artery; lower down there are usually two satellite veins,\r\nanterior and posterior. The chief collateral branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 443.—DISSECTION OF LEFT FOREARM OF HORSE, EXTERNAL SURFACE.\r\n    (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n1. =Articular branches= for the elbow joint.\r\n\r\n2. =Muscular branches= to the flexors of the carpus and digit. The\r\nlargest of these arise at the proximal third of the forearm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 444.—DEEP DISSECTION OF RIGHT CARPUS OF HORSE, POSTERIOR VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Radial carpal bone; _2_, accessory carpal bone; _3_, second\r\n    carpal bone.

The =common interosseous artery= (A. interossea communis) is a vessel\r\nof considerable size which arises at the level of the interosseous\r\nspace, through which it passes. Before entering the space it gives off a\r\nsmall branch, the volar interosseous (A. interossea volaris), which\r\ndescends to the radial head of the perforans. In the space it supplies\r\nthe nutrient arteries of the radius and ulna. Emerging from the space it\r\ngives off branches to the flexor carpi externus, a small =recurrent\r\nbranch= (A. interossea recurrens) which passes upward on the outer\r\nsurface of the ulna and anastomoses with the deep brachial and ulnar\r\narteries, and is continued as the =dorsal interosseous artery=. This\r\nvessel (A. interossea dorsalis) passes down between the anterior and\r\nlateral extensors of the digit and concurs with the anterior radial in\r\nforming a network on the anterior surface of the carpus, the =rete carpi\r\ndorsale=. From the latter arise two small vessels, the =internal= and\r\n=external dorsal metacarpal arteries= (A. metacarpea dorsalis medialis,\r\nlateralis), which run distally in the grooves between the large and\r\nsmall metacarpal bones and anastomose with the volar metacarpal\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n4. The =artery of the rete carpi volare= (A. retis carpi volaris) is a\r\nsmall vessel which arises at the distal third of the forearm and passes\r\ndownward to the posterior surface of the carpus, where it concurs with\r\nbranches of the volar metacarpal arteries in forming the rete carpi\r\nvolare.\r\n\r\n5. The =external volar metacarpal artery= (A. metacarpea volaris\r\nlateralis) is a small vessel which arises just above the carpus under\r\ncover of the flexor carpi medius and anastomoses with the ulnar artery,\r\nforming the supracarpal arch. From the latter a branch descends with the\r\nouter branch of the median nerve, inclines outward toward the posterior\r\nborder of the accessory carpal bone, and arrives at the head of the\r\nexternal metacarpal bone. Here it is connected with the internal volar\r\nmetacarpal artery, usually by two transverse branches, thus forming the\r\n=deep volar= or =subcarpal arch= (Arcus volaris profundus). One of these\r\nbranches lies between the subcarpal check ligament and the suspensory\r\nligament; the other (not always present) lies beneath the latter on the\r\nlarge metacarpal bone. A small branch descends to the fetlock with the\r\nexternal metacarpal nerve. Below the arch the artery pursues a flexuous\r\ncourse downward on the posterior face of the large metacarpal bone\r\nalongside of the external small metacarpal and under cover of the\r\nsuspensory ligament. At the distal third of the metacarpus it commonly\r\nunites with the corresponding vessel of the inner side to form a short\r\ntrunk which passes backward through the angle of divergence of the\r\nbranches of the suspensory ligament and joins the external digital or\r\nthe common digital artery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 446.—CROSS-SECTION OF MIDDLE OF RIGHT METACARPUS OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Common digital (or large metacarpal) artery; _b_, internal\r\n    metacarpal vein; _c_, internal metacarpal nerve; _d_, external\r\n    metacarpal nerve; _e_, branch of external volar metacarpal artery;\r\n    _f_, external metacarpal vein; _g_, _g_, _g_, deep volar or\r\n    interosseous metacarpal arteries; _h_, tendon of anterior extensor;\r\n    _i_, tendon of lateral extensor; _k_, anastomotic branch connecting\r\n    metacarpal nerves; _l_, deep flexor tendon; _m_, check ligament;\r\n    _n_, superficial flexor tendon; _o_, suspensory ligament; _p_, large\r\n    metacarpal bone; _q_, _q_, small metacarpal bones; _r_, skin (After\r\n    Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n6. The =internal volar= or =small metacarpal artery= (A. metacarpea\r\nvolaris medialis) is given off from the posterior radial at an acute\r\nangle, usually a little above the external one or by a common trunk with\r\nit. It passes down the inner side of the carpus behind the tendon of the\r\nflexor carpi internus and embedded in the posterior annular ligament.\r\nArriving at the proximal end of the inner metacarpal bone it becomes\r\nmore deeply placed and is connected with the external volar artery by\r\none or two transverse branches as stated above. It then pursues a\r\nflexuous course downward alongside of the inner small metacarpal bone,\r\nlike the corresponding external artery, with which it commonly unites as\r\ndescribed above. It is larger than the external artery and supplies the\r\nnutrient artery to the large metacarpal bone.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The foregoing account describes the most common arrangement of the\r\n  dorsal and volar metacarpal arteries. Variations in their origin and\r\n  connections are common, but have no great surgical importance.\r\n  Collateral branches are omitted for the same reason. In some cases the\r\n  internal volar metacarpal is connected with the common digital or\r\n  large metacarpal artery a little below the carpus by a branch passing\r\n  obliquely across the inner border of the deep flexor tendon; this\r\n  forms a superficial volar arch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE COMMON DIGITAL ARTERY\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 447.—DISSECTION OF RIGHT CARPUS, METACARPUS, AND DIGIT OF HORSE,\r\n    INNER VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =common digital= or =large metacarpal artery=[164] is the direct\r\ncontinuation of the posterior radial. It descends in the carpal canal\r\nalong the inner side of the flexor tendons in company with the inner\r\nbranch of the median nerve and a satellite vein. Continuing down the\r\nlimb it preserves this relation to the tendons to the distal third of\r\nthe metacarpus, where it inclines toward the middle line of the limb\r\nbehind the suspensory ligament, and divides into the internal and\r\nexternal digital arteries. In the metacarpus the artery is related to\r\nthe vein in front and the artery behind, and is covered by the fascia\r\nand skin. It furnishes collateral branches to the suspensory ligament,\r\nthe flexor tendons, and the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE DIGITAL ARTERIES\r\n\r\nThe =internal= and =external digital arteries= (A. digitalis medialis,\r\nlateralis) are formed by the bifurcation of the common digital at the\r\ndistal third of the metacarpus. They diverge, pass down over the outer\r\nsurface of the corresponding sesamoid at the fetlock, and descend\r\nparallel with the borders of the deep flexor tendon to the volar grooves\r\nand foramina of the third phalanx. Entering the latter the two arteries\r\nunite in the semilunar canal and form the =terminal arch= (Arcus\r\nterminalis), from which numerous branches pass through the bone to the\r\nwall surface and ramify in the matrix of the wall and sole of the hoof.\r\nA number of branches emerge through the foramina at the lower border,\r\nwhere they anastomose with each other in arciform fashion. These\r\nbranches were named by Spooner the inferior communicating arteries, and\r\nthe anastomotic arch formed by them is termed the circumflex artery of\r\nthe third phalanx (Chauveau) or the artery of the lower border of the\r\nthird phalanx (Leisering).\r\n\r\nEach artery is accompanied by a vein and by the digital nerves. Above\r\nthe fetlock the artery is most deeply placed and is covered by the vein;\r\nthe nerve is behind the vein. At the fetlock the artery has become\r\nsuperficial and is related to the vein in front and the posterior branch\r\nof the nerve behind. The anterior branch of the nerve crosses over the\r\nartery obliquely to the lateral aspect of the first phalanx. The vessels\r\nand nerves are crossed obliquely by a small tendinous band, the ligament\r\nof the ergot, which begins in the fibrous basis of the ergot at the back\r\nof the fetlock and extends downward and forward to end in the fascia at\r\nthe side of the pastern joint.\r\n\r\nIn addition to branches to the joints, tendons and synovial sheath,\r\nergot, and skin, the digital arteries give off:\r\n\r\n1. The =artery of the first phalanx= or perpendicular artery (A.\r\nphalangis primæ), a short trunk which arises at a right angle about the\r\nmiddle of the first phalanx, and divides into dorsal and volar branches\r\n(Rami dorsales et volares). The dorsal (anterior) branch passes between\r\nthe first phalanx and the extensor tendon and ramifies on the front of\r\nthe digit, anastomosing with its fellow. The volar (posterior) branch\r\ndips in between the flexor tendons and the inferior sesamoidean\r\nligaments and anastomoses with the opposite artery.\r\n\r\n2. The =artery of the plantar cushion= (A. toricæ phalangis tertiæ)\r\narises at the proximal border of the lateral cartilage and passes\r\nbackward and downward to ramify in the plantar cushion and the matrix of\r\nthe heels and frog.\r\n\r\n3. The =dorsal artery of the second phalanx= (Ramus dorsalis phalangis\r\nsecundæ) arises a little above the navicular bone, and passes forward\r\nunder cover of the lateral cartilage and the extensor tendon to the\r\nfront of the second phalanx, where it anastomoses with the opposite\r\nvessel. It gives branches to the skin, the tendon, the coffin joint, and\r\nthe coronary matrix of the hoof.\r\n\r\n4. The =volar artery of the second phalanx= (Ramus volaris phalangis\r\nsecundæ) is smaller than the preceding, opposite to which it arises. It\r\npasses above the proximal border of the third sesamoid and unites with\r\nthe opposite artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The arteries of the second phalanx form what is termed by Chauveau the\r\n  =coronary circle=. The dorsal (anterior) part of the circle gives off\r\n  commonly an artery (A. coronalis phalangis tertiæ) near either side of\r\n  the extensor tendon, which divides into two branches. The central\r\n  branch unites with that of the opposite side, while the other joins a\r\n  branch of the artery of the plantar cushion. In this way is formed the\r\n  =circumflex artery of the coronary cushion=, an anastomotic arch which\r\n  lies on the extensor tendon at the coronet. In some cases descending\r\n  branches of the arteries of the first phalanx concur in the formation\r\n  of the arch.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The =dorsal artery of the third phalanx= or preplantar artery (A.\r\ndorsalis phalangis tertiæ) arises at the deep face of the wing of the\r\nthird phalanx, passes outward through the notch or foramen there, and\r\nruns forward in the groove on the wall surface. It gives off ascending\r\nand descending branches, which ramify in the matrix of the wall of the\r\nhoof, anastomosing above with the circumflex artery of the coronary\r\ncushion and below with the circumflex artery of the third phalanx.\r\nBefore passing through the wing it detaches a retrograde branch to the\r\nplantar cushion, and after emerging one which ramifies on the outer\r\naspect of the lateral cartilage.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The terminal part of the digital artery after giving off the preceding\r\n  vessel is sometimes termed the plantar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BRANCHES OF THE THORACIC AORTA\r\n\r\nIn addition to the coronary arteries and the common brachiocephalic\r\ntrunk (which have been described), the thoracic part of the aorta gives\r\noff branches to the thoracic walls and viscera and to the spinal cord\r\nand its membranes. The =visceral branches= (Rami viscerales) are the\r\nbronchial and œsophageal, which arise by a broncho-œsophageal trunk. The\r\n=parietal branches= (Rami parietales) are the intercostal and phrenic\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n1. The =broncho-œsophageal= (Truncus broncho-œsophageus) is a short,\r\nusually bulbous, trunk which arises at the sixth thoracic vertebra from\r\nthe aorta or in common with the first aortic intercostal arteries. It\r\npasses (under cover of the vena azygos) down the right face of the aorta\r\ntoward the bifurcation of the trachea and divides into bronchial and\r\nœsophageal branches.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =bronchial artery= (A. bronchialis) crosses the left face of\r\nthe œsophagus to the bifurcation of the trachea, where it divides into\r\nright and left branches. Each enters the hilus of the corresponding lung\r\nabove the bronchus, which it accompanies in its ramification. It\r\nsupplies the lung tissue and also detaches twigs to the bronchial lymph\r\nglands and the mediastinum.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =œsophageal artery= (A. œsophagea) (Fig. 429) is a small\r\nvessel which passes backward above the œsophagus in the posterior\r\nmediastinum and anastomoses with the œsophageal branch of the gastric\r\nartery. It detaches twigs to the œsophagus and the mediastinal lymph\r\nglands and pleura, and also gives off two branches which pass between\r\nthe layers of the ligaments of the lungs and ramify in the subpleural\r\ntissue. Very commonly there is another artery which runs backward\r\nventral to the œsophagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases there is no broncho-œsophageal trunk, the bronchial and\r\n  œsophageal arising separately. In other cases the second aortic\r\n  intercostal arises in common with them also.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The =intercostal arteries= (Aa. intercostales) (Figs. 428, 429)\r\nnumber eighteen pairs. The first arises from the deep cervical artery,\r\nthe next three from the subcostal branch of the dorsal artery, and the\r\nremainder from the aorta. The aortic intercostals arise from the dorsal\r\nface of the aorta in pairs close together; the fifth and sixth usually\r\nspring from a common stem. Each passes across the body of a vertebra to\r\nthe corresponding intercostal space, detaches twigs to the vertebræ and\r\nthe pleura, and divides into dorsal and ventral branches. The =dorsal\r\nbranch= (Ramus dorsalis) gives off a spinal branch (Ramus spinalis)\r\nwhich passes through the intervertebral foramen, gives twigs to the\r\nmembranes of the spinal cord, perforates the dura, and reinforces the\r\nventral spinal artery. A muscular branch passes to the muscles and skin\r\nof the back. The =ventral branch= (Ramus ventralis) is much the larger.\r\nIt passes downward, at first almost in the middle of the intercostal\r\nspace between the intercostal muscles, then gains the posterior border\r\nof the rib and is subpleural. Each is accompanied by a vein and nerve,\r\nthe artery being in the middle and the vein in front. At the lower part\r\nof the space it unites with a ventral intercostal branch of the internal\r\nthoracic or the asternal artery. It supplies the intercostal muscles,\r\nthe ribs and the pleura, and gives off perforating branches which pass\r\nout to the serratus magnus, the abdominal muscles, and the skin.\r\n\r\n3. The =phrenic arteries= (Aa. phrenicæ) are two or three small vessels\r\nwhich arise at the hiatus aorticus from the ventral aspect of the aorta,\r\noften by a common trunk. They supply the crura of the diaphragm. In some\r\ncases they arise in common with an intercostal artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BRANCHES OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA\r\n\r\nThe collateral branches of the abdominal part of the aorta are\r\ndistributed chiefly to the walls and contents of the abdominal cavity,\r\nbut some branches are supplied to the spinal cord and its membranes, and\r\nothers extend into the pelvis and to the scrotum. The =visceral\r\nbranches= are the cœliac, anterior mesenteric, renal, posterior\r\nmesenteric, and the spermatic or utero-ovarian. The =parietal branches=\r\nare the lumbar arteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 448.—PLAN OF BRANCHES OF CŒLIAC ARTERY OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cœliac artery; _2_, gastric artery; _3_, hepatic artery; _4_,\r\n    splenic artery; _5_, posterior gastric artery; _6_, anterior gastric\r\n    artery; _7_, œsophageal branch; _8_, gastro-duodenal artery; _9_,\r\n    pancreatico-duodenal artery; _10_, right gastro-epiploic artery;\r\n    _11_, pyloric artery; _12_, left gastro-epiploic artery; _13_, short\r\n    gastric branches of splenic.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI. The =cœliac artery= or =axis= (A. cœliaca) is an unpaired vessel,\r\nusually half an inch or less (ca. 1 cm.) in length, which arises from\r\nthe ventral aspect of the aorta at its emergence from the hiatus\r\naorticus. It divides on the dorsal surface of the pancreas into three\r\nbranches—the gastric, hepatic, and splenic.\r\n\r\n1. The =gastric artery= (A. gastrica sinistra) passes downward and\r\nforward in the gastro-phrenic ligament, gives off œsophageal and\r\npancreatic branches, and divides above and behind the cardia into\r\nanterior and posterior branches.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =anterior branch= (Ramus cranialis) crosses the lesser\r\ncurvature just to the right of the cardia and ramifies on the parietal\r\nsurface of the stomach. The branches pursue a flexuous course toward the\r\ngreater curvature and anastomose with the short gastric arteries and the\r\ngastric branch of the hepatic artery.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =posterior branch= (Ramus caudalis) is distributed in a\r\nsimilar fashion on the visceral surface.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The =œsophageal branch= (Ramus œsophageus) passes through the\r\nhiatus œsophageus into the thoracic cavity above the œsophagus and\r\nanastomoses with the œsophageal branch of the broncho-œsophageal artery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 449.—PLAN OF CHIEF BRANCHES OF ANTERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY OF\r\n    HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Stump of anterior mesenteric artery; _2_, stumps of arteries of\r\n    small intestine; _3_, external cæcal artery, _4_, internal cæcal\r\n    artery; _5_, ileal artery; _6_, ventral colic artery; _7_, dorsal\r\n    colic artery; _8_, middle colic or first artery of small colon.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The gastric artery often arises by a common trunk with the splenic.\r\n  The two terminal branches may arise separately, or the anterior from\r\n  the splenic and the posterior from the hepatic.

The position of the\r\n    kidneys is indicated by dotted lines. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d.\r\n    Anat. d. Pferdes)\r\n]\r\n\r\n2. The =hepatic artery= (A. hepatica) is larger than the gastric. It\r\npasses forward to the right and ventrally on the dorsal surface of the\r\npancreas, covered by the gastro-pancreatic fold, crossing obliquely\r\nunder the vena cava, and reaches the inner border of the portal vein. It\r\ndivides into three or four branches which enter the portal fissure of\r\nthe liver and ramify within the gland with the portal vein and the\r\nhepatic duct. It gives off the following collateral branches:\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Pancreatic branches= (Aa. pancreaticæ) are given off as the\r\nartery crosses the pancreas, in which it is partly embedded.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =pyloric artery= (A. gastrica dextra) arises above the first\r\ncurve of the duodenum. It descends to the pylorus, sending branches to\r\nthe first part of the duodenum and the pylorus, and anastomoses with the\r\ngastric and right gastro-epiploic arteries. It may arise from the\r\ngastro-duodenal.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The =gastro-duodenal artery= (A. gastroduodenalis) passes to the\r\nsecond curve of the duodenum and divides into the right gastro-epiploic\r\nand the pancreatico-duodenal. The =right gastro-epiploic artery= (A.\r\ngastroepiploica dextra) crosses over the posterior surface of the\r\nduodenum and enters the great omentum, in which it runs to the left,\r\nparallel with the greater curvature of the stomach. It gives branches to\r\nthe latter and to the omentum and forms an anastomotic arch with the\r\nleft gastro-epiploic artery. The =pancreatico-duodenal artery= (A.\r\npancreaticoduodenalis) divides into pancreatic and duodenal branches.\r\nThe former (Ramus pancreaticus) supplies the middle part of the pancreas\r\nand is often replaced by a number of variable twigs. The duodenal branch\r\n(Ramus duodenalis) passes to the right along the lesser curvature of the\r\nduodenum and anastomoses with the first branch of the anterior\r\nmesenteric artery.\r\n\r\n3. The =splenic artery= (A. lienalis) is the largest branch of the\r\ncœliac. It passes to the left (with the large satellite vein) on the\r\nleft extremity of the pancreas and across the saccus cæcus of the\r\nstomach. Entering the suspensory ligament of the spleen, it runs in the\r\nhilus of the spleen to the apex, beyond which it is continued as the\r\nleft gastro-epiploic. It gives off the following branches:\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Pancreatic branches= (Rami pancreatici) to the left extremity of\r\nthe pancreas.\r\n\r\n(_b_) =Splenic branches= (Rami lienales), which plunge into the\r\nsubstance of the spleen.\r\n\r\n(_c_) =Gastric branches= (Aa. gastricæ breves), which pass in the\r\ngastro-splenic omentum to the greater curvature of the stomach, where\r\nthey bifurcate and anastomose with the gastric arteries.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The =left gastro-epiploic artery= (A. gastroepiploica sinistra) is\r\nthe continuation of the splenic artery. It passes to the right in the\r\ngreat omentum, parallel with the greater curvature of the stomach, and\r\nanastomoses with the right gastro-epiploic. It gives off branches to the\r\ngreater curvature of the stomach, and twigs to the omentum.\r\n\r\nII. The =anterior= or =great mesenteric artery= (A. mesenterica\r\ncranialis) arises from the ventral face of the aorta at the first lumbar\r\nvertebra. It is a large unpaired trunk, about an inch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.)\r\nin length, which passes ventrally between the vena cava and the left\r\nadrenal into the root of the great mesentery, when it divides into three\r\nbranches—left, right, and anterior.[165]\r\n\r\n1. The =left branch= gives off at once about fifteen to twenty =arteries\r\nof the small intestine= (Aa. intestinales).[166] These come off close\r\ntogether and pass in divergent fashion between the layers of the great\r\nmesentery, each dividing into two branches which anastomose with\r\nadjacent branches to form a series of arches. In the anterior part of\r\nthe series secondary arches are formed by the union of branches given\r\noff from the primary set of arches. From the convex side of these arches\r\nterminal branches pass to the wall of the small intestine, in which they\r\nramify and form a vascular network. They are accompanied by satellite\r\nveins and by nerves and lymph vessels. The first artery anastomoses with\r\nthe pancreatico-duodenal, and the last with the ileal branch of the\r\ngreat mesenteric artery. Branches are supplied to the mesenteric lymph\r\nglands.\r\n\r\n2. The =right branch= (A. ileo-cæco-colica) might be regarded as the\r\ncontinuation of the trunk. It runs downward and a little forward and to\r\nthe right and gives off the ileal, the two cæcal, and the ventral colic\r\narteries.\r\n\r\n(1) The =ileal= or =ileo-cæcal artery= (A. ilea) passes in retrograde\r\nfashion along the terminal part of the ileum and unites with the last\r\nbranch of the left division.\r\n\r\n(2) The =external= or =inferior cæcal artery= (Ramus cæcalis lateralis)\r\npasses between the cæcum and the origin of the colon and runs on the\r\nexternal muscular band of the cæcum to the apex, where it anastomoses\r\nwith the internal artery. Besides numerous collaterals to the cæcum, it\r\ngives off the artery of the arch, which passes along the lesser\r\ncurvature of the base of the cæcum and runs on the outer face of the\r\norigin of the great colon.\r\n\r\n(3) The =internal= or =superior cæcal artery= (Ramus cæcalis medialis)\r\npasses along the inner band to the apex of the cæcum, where it\r\nanastomoses with the external cæcal artery.\r\n\r\n(4) The =ventral=, =right=, or =direct colic artery= (A. colica\r\nventralis) runs along the opposed surfaces of the ventral (first and\r\nsecond) parts of the great colon to the pelvic flexure, where it unites\r\nwith the dorsal colic artery. It supplies the ventral parts of the great\r\ncolon and sends a branch to the base of the cæcum.\r\n\r\n3. The =anterior branch= divides after a very short course into the\r\ndorsal and middle colic arteries.\r\n\r\n(1) The =dorsal=, =left=, or =retrograde colic artery= (A. colica\r\ndorsalis) is a large vessel which passes along the dorsal (fourth and\r\nthird) parts of the great colon to the pelvic flexure, where it joins\r\nthe ventral colic artery.\r\n\r\n(2) The =middle colic artery= or =first artery of the small colon= (A.\r\ncolica media) is a much smaller vessel which passes to the origin of the\r\nsmall colon, enters the colic mesentery, and forms an arch by joining\r\nthe first branch of the posterior mesenteric artery close to the lesser\r\ncurvature of the bowel. It sends an anastomotic branch to the dorsal\r\ncolic artery.\r\n\r\nIII. The =renal arteries= (Aa. renales), right and left, are relatively\r\nlarge vessels which arise from the aorta near the anterior mesenteric.\r\nThe =right artery= is the longer of the two. It crosses over the dorsal\r\nsurface of the vena cava to the right and somewhat forward. At the hilus\r\nit divides into several (five to eight) branches; some of these enter\r\nthe gland at the hilus, while others pass to the ventral surface and\r\nenter there. The =left artery= is short and usually arises a little\r\nfurther back; it passes directly outward to the kidney and is then\r\ndisposed like the right one. Small collateral branches are supplied to\r\nthe ureters and the adrenals. The latter also receive small vessels\r\ndirectly from the aorta. The distribution within the kidney has been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Variations in the renal arteries are frequent. Two or more arteries\r\n  may occur on one or both sides. Accessory arteries are more common on\r\n  the left side and usually enter the posterior pole of the gland. They\r\n  may arise from the aorta, the external iliac, or the circumflex iliac\r\n  artery.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The =posterior= or =small mesenteric artery= (A. mesenterica\r\ncaudalis) is an unpaired vessel which arises from the ventral face of\r\nthe aorta at the fourth lumbar vertebra, _i. e._, about five or six\r\ninches (ca. 12 to 15 cm.) behind the origin of the anterior mesenteric\r\nartery. It is much smaller than the latter and supplies the greater part\r\nof the small colon and rectum. It descends in the colic mesentery and\r\ndivides into two branches. The anterior branch (A. colica sinistra)\r\ngives off three or four arteries which divide and form anastomotic\r\narches close to the bowel. The first arch is formed by union with the\r\nmiddle colic branch of the anterior mesenteric. The posterior branch or\r\nanterior hæmorrhoidal artery (A. hæmorrhoidalis cranialis) passes\r\nbackward in the upper part of the mesentery and the mesorectum and\r\nterminates near the anus by anastomosing with the internal pudic artery.\r\nThree or four of its anterior collateral branches form arches.\r\n\r\nV. The =spermatic arteries= (Aa. spermaticæ internæ), right and left,\r\nare long slender arteries which arise from the aorta near the posterior\r\nmesenteric and supply the testicle and epididymis. Each passes backward\r\nin a narrow fold of peritoneum (Plica vasculosa) to the internal\r\ninguinal ring and descends through the inguinal canal to the scrotum. In\r\nthe canal and scrotum it pursues a very flexuous course in the anterior\r\nborder of the spermatic cord, surrounded by the pampiniform plexus of\r\nveins, and associated closely with the spermatic nerves and lymphatics\r\nand unstriped muscle-fibers. It passes between the epididymis and\r\ntesticle, runs in flexuous fashion along the attached border of the\r\nlatter, turns around the posterior pole, and runs forward on the free\r\nborder to the anterior pole. The largest branches arise from its ventral\r\npart, pass tortuously up either side of the gland embedded in the tunica\r\nalbuginea, and give off fine branches to the gland substance. Small\r\ncollateral branches are detached to the ureter and the spermatic cord.\r\n\r\nThe =utero-ovarian arteries= in the female correspond to the preceding\r\nvessels, but are much shorter. Each is placed in the anterior part of\r\nthe broad ligament of the uterus and divides into ovarian and uterine\r\nbranches. The =ovarian branch= (A. ovarica) pursues a flexuous course to\r\nthe ovary, which it supplies. The =uterine branch= (A. uterina\r\ncranialis) passes to the concave border of the cornu of the uterus,\r\nwhich it supplies, anastomosing with the uterine artery.\r\n\r\nVI. The =lumbar arteries= (Aa. lumbales) are in series with the\r\nintercostal arteries and have a similar origin and distribution. There\r\nare usually six pairs of lumbar arteries, of which five arise from the\r\naorta and the sixth from the internal iliac or the lateral sacral at the\r\njunction of the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum. Each passes across\r\nthe body of a lumbar vertebra to the intertransverse space, gives\r\nbranches to the sublumbar muscles, and divides into dorsal and ventral\r\nbranches. The =dorsal branch= (Ramus dorsalis), the larger of the two,\r\npasses upward to ramify in the extensor muscles of the spine and the\r\nskin of the loins; it gives off a =spinal branch= (Ramus spinalis) which\r\ncomports itself like the corresponding branch of an aortic intercostal\r\nartery. The =ventral branch= (Ramus ventralis) runs outward in the\r\nintertransverse space, passes between the transversus and obliquus\r\ninternus abdominis, gives branches to these muscles, and ends in the\r\nobliquus externus, the panniculus, and the skin of the flank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 451.—DISSECTION OF PELVIS, THIGH, AND UPPER PART OF LEG OF HORSE,\r\n    INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _L_, Lumbar vessels; _V.c._, posterior vena cava; _A_, aorta\r\n    (termination); _C_, sympathetic trunk; _1_, internal iliac artery,\r\n    _2_, lateral sacral artery; _3_, middle coccygeal artery; _4_,\r\n    lateral coccygeal artery; _5_, umbilical artery (cut off); _6_,\r\n    internal pudic artery; _6′_, vesico-prostatic artery; _7_, obturator\r\n    artery; _8_, a. profunda penis (from left obturator); _9_, posterior\r\n    gluteal (or ischiatic) vessels; _10_, external iliac artery; _11_,\r\n    _11′_, deep femoral artery; _12_, prepubic artery; _13_, branch of\r\n    deep femoral artery; _14_, great sciatic nerve; _15_, posterior\r\n    gluteal nerve; _16_ (above), internal pudic nerve; _16_ (below near\r\n    pelvic outlet), suburethral venous plexus; _17_, sacro-coccygeus\r\n    inferior; _18_, coccygeus; _19_, recto-coccygeus; _20_, retractor\r\n    ani; _21_, _21′_, two heads of obturator internus; _22_, symphysis\r\n    pelvis; _23_, prepubic tendon; _24_, suspensory ligament of penis;\r\n    _25_, retractor penis muscle; _26_, bulbo-cavernosus muscle; _27_,\r\n    urethra (cross-section); _28_, crus penis (cross-section); _29_,\r\n    suspensory ligaments of anus (= upper part of retractor penis\r\n    muscle); _30_, anal lymph glands; _31_, tibial nerve.

They diverge at an angle of about 60 degrees, and each passes\r\nbackward under the wing of the sacrum, then inclines downward on the\r\npelvic surface of the shaft of the ilium, and divides a little above the\r\npsoas tubercle into iliaco-femoral and obturator arteries. The chief\r\nbranches are as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 452.—DISSECTION OF PERINEUM OF HORSE (MALE).\r\n\r\n  _1_, Bulbo-urethral (Cowper’s) gland; _2_, transversus perinei muscle\r\n    (?); _3_, ischio-urethral muscle; _4_, retractor penis muscle; _5_,\r\n    bulbo-cavernosus muscle. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d.\r\n    Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n1. The last pair of =lumbar arteries= pass up through the foramina at\r\nthe junction of the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum.\r\n\r\n2. The =internal pudic artery= (A. pudenda interna) arises near the\r\norigin of the internal iliac. It passes backward and somewhat downward,\r\nat first along the iliac head of the obturator internus, then above the\r\nsuperior ischiatic spine on the inner surface of the sacro-sciatic\r\nligament, perforates the latter and runs for a variable distance in its\r\nsubstance or on its external face. It then re-enters the pelvic cavity,\r\npasses backward on the retractor ani to the ischial arch, and divides\r\ninto the perineal and the artery of the bulb in the male, perineal and\r\nartery of the clitoris in the female. It is accompanied by the internal\r\npudic nerve. Its chief branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The =umbilical artery= is given off from the internal pudic about an\r\ninch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.) from the origin of that vessel. It is a very large\r\nartery in the fœtus, in which it curves downward and forward at the side\r\nof the bladder in the edge of the umbilical fold of peritoneum, passes\r\nthrough the umbilical opening, becomes a component of the umbilical cord\r\nand ramifies in the fœtal placenta. After birth it extends only to the\r\nvertex of the bladder and is much reduced. Its lumen is almost\r\nobliterated and its wall is very thick, giving the vessel a cord-like\r\ncharacter, hence it is commonly termed the round ligament of the\r\nbladder.[167] It gives off small =vesical branches= (Aa. vesicates\r\ncraniales) to the bladder, and twigs to the prostate and vasa deferens\r\nin the male. In the mare a small branch runs forward along the ureter\r\ninto the broad ligament of the uterus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 453.—DISSECTION OF PERINEUM OF MARE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Sacro-coccygeus superior; _2_, sacro-coccygeus lateralis; _3_,\r\n    intertransversales; _4_, sacro-coccygeus inferior; _5_,\r\n    recto-coceygeus; _6_, sphincter ani externus; _6′_, branch\r\n    connecting sphincter ani with constrictor vulvæ; _7_, vestibular\r\n    bulb; _8_, tuber ischii; _9_, sacro-sciatic ligament. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n(2) The =middle hæmorrhoidal= or =vesico-prostatic artery= (A.\r\nhæmorrhoidalis media) in the male arises usually near the prostate and\r\nruns backward lateral to the rectum. It supplies branches to the rectum,\r\nbladder, urethra, and accessory genital glands. In the female the\r\nhomologous vessel is much larger and gives off the =posterior uterine\r\nartery= (A. uterina caudalis). This runs forward on the side of the\r\nvagina, to which it gives branches, and ramifies on the body of the\r\nuterus, anastomosing with the anterior and middle uterine arteries. (In\r\nsome cases this artery arises from the internal iliac or the umbilical.)\r\n\r\n(3) The =perineal artery= (A. perinei) is relatively small in the male.\r\nIt passes upward at the side of the anus, which it supplies, and gives\r\ntwigs to the bulbo-cavernosus muscle and the skin of the perineum. In\r\nthe female it is large and is distributed to the anus and vulva, and\r\ngives a large branch to the vestibular bulb.\r\n\r\n(4) The =artery of the bulb= (A. bulbi urethræ) may be regarded as the\r\ndirect continuation of the internal pudic in the male. It lies at the\r\nside of the urethra above the ischial arch, dips under the\r\nbulbo-cavernosus muscle, and ramifies in the corpus spongiosum. Before\r\ndoing so it gives off a small branch which turns around the ischial arch\r\nto reach the dorsum penis, and anastomoses with the deep branch of the\r\nobturator.\r\n\r\n(4_a_) The =artery of the clitoris= (A. clitoridis) is the homologue in\r\nthe female of the preceding vessel, but is much smaller. It passes to\r\nthe ventral surface of the vulva with the internal pudic nerve, supplies\r\nthe clitoris, and gives twigs to the vulva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 454.-CROSS-SECTION OF TAIL OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Dorso-lateral coccygeal vessels and nerve; _2_, ventro-lateral\r\n    coccygeal artery and nerve; _3_, middle coccygeal artery; _4_,\r\n    sacro-coccygeus superior; _4′_, sacro-coccygeus lateralis; _5_,\r\n    _5′_, intertransversales; _6_, sacro-coccygeus inferior; _7_,\r\n    recto-coccygeus; _8_, coccygeal fascia; _9_, fibro-cartilage between\r\n    fourth and fifth coccygeal vertebra. The veins are black.\r\n]\r\n\r\n3. The =lateral sacral artery= (A. sacralis lateralis) arises at the\r\nlumbo-sacral articulation (Fig. 451). It passes backward under the wing\r\nof the sacrum, then along the pelvic surface of the bone below the\r\ninferior sacral foramina and the nerves emerging from them, and is\r\ncontinued by the lateral coccygeal artery. The branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) =Spinal branches= (Rami spinales) enter the vertebral canal through\r\nthe foramen between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum and through\r\nthe ventral sacral foramina. They give off branches to the spinal cord\r\nand its membranes which reinforce the ventral spinal artery, and others\r\nwhich emerge through the dorsal sacral foramina and supply the muscles\r\nand skin of the croup.\r\n\r\n(2) The =middle coccygeal artery= (A. coccygea) is an unpaired vessel\r\nwhich arises from the right or left lateral sacral or from a lateral\r\ncoccygeal artery. It passes backward on the pelvic surface of the sacrum\r\nto the median line and continues in that position along the tail between\r\nthe depressor muscles, supplying these and the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 455.—DISSECTION OF PELVIS, THIGH, AND LEG OF HORSE, EXTERNAL\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Dorsal branches of last intercostal and first three lumbar\r\n    nerves; _2_, cutaneous branch of fourth lumbar nerve; _3_, ventral\r\n    branches of last intercostal nerve: _4_, branches of\r\n    ilio-hypogastric nerve; _5_, superficial branch of ilio-inguinal\r\n    nerve; _6_, great sciatic nerve; _7_, _8_, nerves to biceps femoris\r\n    (from posterior gluteal nerve); _9_, nerve to semitendinosus (from\r\n    same); _10_, posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh; _11_, internal\r\n    pudic nerve; _12_, anterior gluteal vessels and nerves; _13_,\r\n    posterior gluteal (or ischiatic) vessels; _14_, branches of\r\n    obturator vessels; _15_, proximal muscular branches of great sciatic\r\n    nerve to biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus; _16_,\r\n    nerve to tensor fasciæ latæ (from anterior gluteal nerve); _17_,\r\n    gluteus profundus; _18_, stump of gluteus medius; _19_, gemellus;\r\n    _20_, trochanter major; _21_, stump of biceps femoris; _22_,\r\n    sacro-coccygeus superior; _22′_, sacro-coccygeus lateralis; _23_,\r\n    coccygeus; _24_, sacro-coccygeus inferior; _25_, line of fusion of\r\n    aponeuroses of internal and external oblique muscles of abdomen;\r\n    _25′_, aponeurosis of external oblique muscle (lamina iliaca); _26_,\r\n    branches of iliaco-femoral vessels; _27_, ilio-lumbar vessels; _28_,\r\n    ilio-lumbar ligament or deep layer of lumbo-dorsal fascia; _29_,\r\n    external angle of ilium; _30_, internal angle of ilium; _31_,\r\n    lateral sacro-iliac ligament; _32_, sacro-sciatic ligament.

It gives branches to that muscle and to the semitendinosus\r\nand semimembranosus, and anastomoses with the obturator, deep femoral,\r\nand posterior femoral arteries.\r\n\r\n(4) The =lateral coccygeal artery= (A. caudalis lateralis ventralis)\r\ncontinues the direction of the lateral sacral, but is much smaller than\r\nthe preceding vessel. It passes back between the depressor and\r\nintertransversales muscles of the tail and divides into two branches\r\nwhich supply twigs to the muscles and skin.\r\n\r\n4. The =ilio-lumbar artery= (A. iliolumbalis) arises at a right angle\r\nfrom the internal iliac and runs outward behind the sacro-iliac joint,\r\ncrossing the ventral surface of the ilium under cover of the iliacus\r\nmuscle. It gives branches to the ilio-psoas and longissimus, and\r\nterminates by turning around the external border of the ilium a little\r\nbehind the external angle, giving branches to the gluteus medius and\r\ntensor fasciæ latæ (Fig. 455).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 456.—DEEP DISSECTION OF VENTRAL WALL OF PELVIS OF HORSE (MALE).\r\n\r\n  _1_, External pudic artery and small satellite vein; _2_, anastomosis\r\n    between external pudic and internal circumflex veins; _3_, accessory\r\n    ligament; _4_, round ligament; _5_, transverse ligament; _6_, head\r\n    of femur; _7_, obturator externus (stumps); _8_, inner margin of\r\n    obturator foramen; _9_, origin of gracilis; _10_, origin of\r\n    adductor; _11_, bulbo-cavernosus; _12_, retractor penis; _13_,\r\n    suspensory ligament of penis. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d.\r\n    Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n5. The =anterior gluteal artery= (A. glutea cranialis) is the largest\r\nbranch of the internal iliac. It arises usually opposite to the\r\npreceding vessel and passes outward through the great sacro-sciatic\r\nforamen, dividing into several branches as it emerges; these enter the\r\ngluteal muscles (Fig. 455).\r\n\r\n6. The =iliaco-femoral= or =external circumflex artery= (A. cireumflexa\r\nfemoris lateralis) passes downward and outward across and beneath the\r\nshaft of the ilium, under cover of the iliacus muscle, and dips in\r\nbetween the rectus femoris and vastus externus. It is accompanied by two\r\nsatellite veins. It gives collateral branches to the ilio-psoas, the\r\nglutei, and the tensor fasciæ latæ, supplies the nutrient artery of the\r\nilium, and terminates in the quadriceps femoris (Fig. 455).\r\n\r\n7. The =obturator artery= (A. obturatoria), the inner terminal branch of\r\nthe internal iliac, passes downward and backward on the pelvic surface\r\nof the shaft of the ilium along the ventral border of the iliac head of\r\nthe obturator internus, accompanied by the satellite vein and nerve,\r\nwhich lie in front of the artery (Fig. 451). On reaching the anterior\r\nborder of the obturator foramen it dips under the obturator internus and\r\npasses obliquely through the foramen. In this part of its course it\r\ngives off a vesical branch and twigs to the obturator internus and the\r\nhip joint. After its emergence from the pelvic cavity it runs backward\r\non the ventral face of the ischium, passes through the semimembranosus\r\nand, in the male, enters the crus penis, forming the arteria profunda\r\npenis. It anastomoses with the internal pudic, and usually with the\r\nexternal pudic by a branch which runs forward on the dorsum penis. Large\r\ncollateral branches are detached to the adductors of the thigh, the\r\nbiceps femoris and semitendinosus, forming anastomoses with the deep\r\nfemoral and posterior femoral arteries. In the female the terminal part\r\nis small and enters the root of the clitoris.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ARTERIES OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe main arterial trunk of each pelvic limb descends as far as the lower\r\nborder of the popliteus muscle, where it divides into the anterior and\r\nposterior tibial arteries. The different parts of the trunk receive\r\nspecial names which correspond to the several regions through which it\r\npasses. In the abdomen it is termed the =external iliac artery=, in the\r\nproximal two-thirds of the thigh it is called the =femoral artery=,\r\nwhile below this it is termed the =popliteal artery=.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE EXTERNAL ILIAC ARTERY (Figs. 450, 451)\r\n\r\nThe =external iliac artery= (A. iliaca externa) arises from the aorta\r\nunder the fifth lumbar vertebra, usually just in front of the origin of\r\nthe internal iliac. It descends at the side of the pelvic inlet along\r\nthe tendon of the psoas minor, crosses the insertion of that muscle, and\r\nreaches the level of the anterior border of the pubis, where it becomes\r\nthe femoral artery. It is covered by the peritoneum and fascia, and is\r\nrelated behind to the corresponding vein. Its branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =circumflex iliac artery= (A. circumflexa ilium profunda) arises\r\nfrom the external iliac at its origin or from the aorta directly. It\r\npasses across the iliac fascia toward the external angle of the ilium,\r\nnear which it divides into two branches. The artery lies between the\r\nfascia and the peritoneum and is accompanied by two veins and the\r\nexternal cutaneous nerve of the thigh. The =anterior branch= gives twigs\r\nto the iliacus and psoas muscles, and passes downward and forward in the\r\nflank between the obliquus internus and transversus abdominis, in which\r\nit ramifies. The =posterior branch= perforates the abdominal wall and\r\nruns downward on the inner face of the tensor fasciæ latæ to the fold of\r\nthe flank, supplying branches to that muscle, the panniculus, the\r\nprecrural lymph glands, and the skin.\r\n\r\n2. The =cremasteric artery= (A. spermatica externa) is a very small\r\nvessel which arises in a variable manner. It springs most often from the\r\nexternal iliac near its origin, but may come from the circumflex iliac,\r\nthe aorta between the external and internal iliac, or the latter vessel.\r\nIt accompanies the cremaster muscle to the inguinal canal, supplies\r\ntwigs to that muscle, the tunica vaginalis, and other constituents of\r\nthe spermatic cord (Fig. 450).\r\n\r\n2_a_. The =middle uterine artery= (A. uterina media) of the female is\r\nregarded as the homologue of the preceding vessel. It has a similar\r\norigin, but is a much larger artery, which passes between the layers of\r\nthe broad ligament and reaches the horn of the uterus close to its\r\njunction with the body. It is distributed to both, and anastomoses with\r\nthe anterior and posterior uterine arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE FEMORAL ARTERY (Figs. 450, 451)\r\n\r\nThe =femoral artery= is the main arterial trunk of the thigh. It begins\r\nat the level of the anterior border of the pubis, from which it is\r\nseparated by the femoral vein. It descends almost vertically in the\r\nfemoral canal behind the sartorius muscle, covered at first by the\r\ninternal femoral fascia and lower down by the gracilis. After passing\r\nover the insertion of the pectineus, it perforates the adductor muscle,\r\ncrosses in the vascular groove of the posterior surface of the femur,\r\nand is continued between the two heads of the gastrocnemius as the\r\npopliteal artery. It is related at its origin to the sartorius in front,\r\nthe femoral vein behind (which separates it from the pectineus), and the\r\niliacus externally. Lower down it is related superficially to the deep\r\ninguinal lymph glands, and deeply to the vastus internus, while the\r\nsaphenous nerve is in front of it, and the vein passes to its external\r\nface. The chief branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 457.—DISSECTION OF INGUINAL REGION AND INNER SURFACE OF THIGH OF\r\n    HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, External pudic artery; _2_, anterior branches of _1_; _3_,\r\n    posterior branches of _1_; _4_, transverse anastomosis between\r\n    external pudic veins; _4′_, venous plexus of dorsum penis; _5_,\r\n    femoral artery; _6_, saphenous nerve; _7_, anterior border of\r\n    external inguinal ring; _8_, obliquus abdominis internus; _9_,\r\n    posterior border of external inguinal ring; _10_, tunica vaginalis;\r\n    _11_, vas deferens; _12_, cremaster muscle; _13_, prepuce; _14_,\r\n    glans penis; _15_, external urethral orifice; _16_, posterior\r\n    branches of circumflex iliac vessels; _17_, saphenous vessels; _18_,\r\n    fold of flank; _19_, penis (cut); _A_, superficial inguinal lymph\r\n    glands; _B_, precrural lymph glands; _C_, deep inguinal lymph\r\n    glands. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n1. The =prepubic artery= (Truncus pudendo-epigastricus) arises from the\r\nfemoral artery at its origin, usually by a common trunk with the deep\r\nfemoral. It passes forward and a little inward and downward across the\r\nedge of the inguinal ligament, and then runs on the abdominal surface of\r\nthe ligament to the inner part of the internal inguinal ring, where it\r\ndivides over the upper border of the internal oblique muscle into the\r\nposterior abdominal and external pudic arteries.\r\n\r\n(1) The =posterior abdominal artery= (A. epigastrica caudalis) passes\r\nalong the external border of the rectus abdominis and anastomoses in the\r\numbilical region with the anterior abdominal artery (Figs. 272). It\r\nsupplies branches to the rectus and obliquus internus muscles.\r\n\r\n(2) The =external pudic artery= (A. pudenda externa) descends on the\r\ninguinal ligament through the inner part of the inguinal canal and\r\nemerges at the inner angle of the external ring. In the male it divides\r\ninto the =subcutaneous abdominal artery= and the =dorsal artery of the\r\npenis=. The former runs forward a short distance from the linea alba,\r\nand gives branches to the superficial inguinal lymph glands, the sheath,\r\nand the scrotum. The latter passes to the dorsum penis and ends at the\r\nglans as the arteria glandis. It gives off collateral branches (Rami\r\nprofundi penis) to the corpus cavernosum, one of which usually passes\r\nbackward and anastomoses with a branch of the obturator artery. Branches\r\nare also supplied to the superficial inguinal lymph glands, the prepuce,\r\nand the scrotum. In the female the =mammary artery= takes the place of\r\nthe dorsal artery of the penis; it plunges into the base of the mammary\r\ngland.\r\n\r\n2. The =deep femoral artery= (A. profunda femoris) arises either by a\r\ncommon trunk with the prepubic or a little distal to it (Fig. 451). It\r\npasses backward and downward across the inner face of the femoral vein,\r\nthen below the pubis in the space between the hip joint and the\r\npectineus muscle. On reaching the obturator externus it inclines more\r\nventrally and outward, passes out between the internal border of the\r\nfemur and the quadratus femoris, and ramifies in the biceps femoris and\r\nsemitendinosus. It supplies large collateral branches to the adductor\r\nmuscles and twigs to the deep inguinal lymph glands and the hip joint.\r\n\r\n3. The =anterior femoral artery= (A. femoralis cranialis) arises a\r\nlittle distal to the preceding vessel from the opposite side of the\r\nfemoral trunk. It passes forward, outward, and a little downward across\r\nthe deep face of the sartorius, and dips in between the rectus femoris\r\nand vastus internus (Fig. 451). It is related externally to the\r\nilio-psoas and the femoral nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases this artery is replaced by a large branch of the\r\n  external circumflex, which passes between the ilio-psoas and rectus\r\n  femoris and enters the interstice between the latter muscle and the\r\n  vastus internus.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Innominate =muscular branches= (Rami musculares) of variable size and\r\narrangement are given off to the muscles of this vicinity.\r\n\r\n5. The =saphenous artery= (A. saphena) is a small vessel which arises\r\nfrom the femoral about its middle or from a muscular branch, and emerges\r\nbetween the sartorius and gracilis or through the latter to the inner\r\nsurface of the thigh (Fig. 457). It is joined by the large saphenous\r\nvein and the saphenous nerve and passes down superficially on the fore\r\npart of the gracilis, continues on the deep fascia of the leg, and\r\ndivides above the hock into two branches, which accompany the radicles\r\nof the vein. It gives off cutaneous twigs and anastomoses with the\r\nrecurrent tibial artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases this anastomosis does not occur. The artery may be\r\n  larger and directly continuous with the internal tarsal artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The =articular branch= (A. genu suprema) is a slender artery which\r\narises from the femoral just before it passes through the adductor. It\r\ndescends along the posterior border of the vastus internus to the inner\r\nsurface of the stifle joint, where it ramifies.\r\n\r\n7. The =nutrient artery of the femur= (A. nutritia femoris) is given off\r\nat the middle of the femur and enters the nutrient foramen.\r\n\r\n8. The =posterior femoral= or =femoro-popliteal artery= (A. femoris\r\ncaudalis) is a large vessel which arises from the posterior face of the\r\nfemoral just before the trunk passes between the two heads of the\r\ngastrocnemius (Fig. 455). It is very short and divides into two\r\nbranches. The ascending branch passes upward and outward between the\r\nadductor (in front) and the semimembranosus (behind), and enters the\r\nbiceps femoris, in which it ramifies. The descending branch passes\r\ndownward and backward on the external head of the gastrocnemius, then\r\ncurves upward between the biceps femoris and semitendinosus (crossed\r\nexternally by the tibial nerve) and divides into branches to these\r\nmuscles. A branch is detached from the convexity of the curve which\r\npasses down between the heads of the gastrocnemius, gives branches to\r\nthat muscle and the flexor perforans, and is continued by a slender\r\nartery which accompanies the tibial nerve and unites with the recurrent\r\ntibial artery. A branch ascends alongside of the sciatic nerve between\r\nthe biceps and semitendinosus and anastomoses with a descending branch\r\nof the obturator.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE POPLITEAL ARTERY\r\n\r\nThis artery (A. poplitea) is the direct continuation of the femoral. It\r\nlies between the two heads of the gastrocnemius, at first on the\r\nposterior face of the femur, then on the femoro-tibial joint capsule. It\r\nthen passes down through the popliteal notch under cover of the\r\npopliteus, inclines outward, and divides near the upper part of the\r\ninterosseous space into anterior and posterior tibial arteries. The\r\nsatellite vein lies along its inner side. Collateral branches are\r\nsupplied to the stifle joint and the gastrocnemius and popliteus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        POSTERIOR TIBIAL ARTERY\r\n\r\nThe =posterior tibial artery= (A. tibialis posterior) is much the\r\nsmaller of the two terminals of the popliteal. It lies at first between\r\nthe tibia and the popliteus, then between that muscle and the deep and\r\ninner heads of the deep flexor. Lower down it descends along the tendon\r\nof the inner head, becomes superficial in the distal third of the leg,\r\nand passes behind the tendon. At the level of the tuber calcis it forms\r\nan ᔕ-shaped curve, runs downward along the deep flexor tendon\r\naccompanied by the plantar nerves, and divides at the lower part of the\r\nhock into internal and external plantar arteries. The collateral\r\nbranches are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =nutrient artery of the tibia= (A. nutritia tibiæ).\r\n\r\n2. =Muscular branches= (Rami musculares) to the popliteus and deep\r\nflexor.\r\n\r\n3. The =external tarsal artery= (A. tarsea lateralis) arises at the\r\ndistal end of the leg and is distributed to the outer surface of the\r\nhock. It gives off a small recurrent branch which ascends along the\r\nexternal border of the gastrocnemius tendon and anastomoses with a\r\nbranch of the posterior femoral artery.\r\n\r\n4. The =recurrent tibial artery= (A. tibialis recurrens) is given off\r\nfrom the second part of the curve, ascends in relation to the tibial\r\nnerve, and anastomoses with the descending branch of the posterior\r\nfemoral and with the saphenous artery.\r\n\r\n5. Small branches (internal calcaneal) to the inner aspect of the hock.\r\n\r\n6. The =plantar arteries=, internal and external (A. plantaris medialis,\r\nlateralis), are the small terminals of the posterior tibial. They\r\ndescend along the sides of the tarsal sheath of the deep flexor with the\r\nplantar nerves to the proximal part of the metatarsus, where they unite\r\nwith the perforating tarsal artery to form the =plantar arch= (Arcus\r\nplantaris). Four =plantar metatarsal arteries= proceed from this arch.\r\nThe two slender =superficial plantar metatarsal arteries= (A. metatarsea\r\nplantaris superficialis medialis, lateralis) descend on either side of\r\nthe deep flexor tendon with the plantar nerves and unite with the great\r\nmetatarsal or with the corresponding digital artery. The two =deep= or\r\n=interosseous plantar metatarsal arteries= (A. metatarsea plantaris\r\nprofundus medialis, lateralis) descend between the suspensory ligament\r\nand the corresponding small metatarsal bone and unite near the fetlock\r\nwith the great metatarsal. The inner artery is the larger of the two and\r\nusually appears to be the continuation of the perforating tarsal. It\r\nsupplies the nutrient artery of the large metatarsal bone. In other\r\ncases it is the direct continuation of the internal plantar artery, the\r\nexternal artery only uniting with the perforating tarsal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 458.—DISSECTION OF LEG AND HOCK OF HORSE, INNER VIEW.

(After Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =anterior tibial artery= (A. tibialis anterior) is much the larger\r\nof the two terminal branches of the popliteal. It passes forward through\r\nthe upper part of the interosseous space and descends with two satellite\r\nveins on the outer part, of the front of the tibia, under cover of the\r\ntibialis anterior. At the lower part of the leg it deviates to the outer\r\nborder of the tendon of this muscle, passes on to the capsule of the\r\nhock joint, gives off the perforating tarsal artery, and is continued\r\nasthe great metatarsal artery. It gives off =muscular branches= to the\r\ndorso-lateral group of muscles of the leg and =articular branches= to\r\nthe hock. The =peroneal= branch (A. peronea) is a variable vessel which\r\ndescends along the fibula under the lateral extensor; it gives off\r\nmuscular branches and one which perforates the fascia and divides into\r\nascending and descending cutaneous twigs.\r\n\r\nThe =perforating tarsal artery= (A. tarsea perforans) is given off under\r\ncover of the outer tendon of the peroneus tertius. It passes backward\r\nthrough the vascular canal of the tarsus with a satellite vein and\r\nunites on the upper part of the suspensory ligament with the plantar\r\narteries (or only with the external plantar) to form the plantar arch.\r\n\r\nIn well-injected specimens it is seen that there is a fine arterial\r\nnetwork (Rete tarsi dorsale) on the flexor surface of the hock, which is\r\nformed by twigs from the anterior tibial and lateral tarsal arteries.\r\nFrom it proceed two very slender =dorsal metatarsal arteries=. The inner\r\none descends in the furrow between the inner small and large metatarsal\r\nbones, and anastomoses usually in the proximal part of the metatarsus\r\nwith the internal superficial plantar metatarsal, uniting sometimes with\r\nthe deep plantar metatarsal. The external vessel passes down under the\r\nperiosteum on the anterior face of the large metatarsal bone and becomes\r\nlost or joins the large metatarsal artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sometimes the anterior tibial artery passes undivided through the\r\n  tarsus, gives off the internal deep plantar metatarsal, and is\r\n  continued as a very large internal superficial plantar metatarsal\r\n  along the deep flexor tendon, thus resembling the arrangement in the\r\n  fore limb.\r\n\r\n  In a few cases the perforating tarsal is a large vessel, directly\r\n  continuing the anterior tibial, and is continued by a large internal\r\n  deep plantar metatarsal. The great metatarsal is then small. Other\r\n  variations are common.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE GREAT METATARSAL ARTERY\r\n\r\nThis artery (A. metatarsea dorsalis lateralis) is the direct\r\ncontinuation of the anterior tibial. It passes downward and outward\r\nunder the extensor brevis and the tendon of the lateral extensor, at\r\nfirst on the joint capsule and then in the oblique vascular groove on\r\nthe upper part of the large metatarsal bone. It then descends in the\r\ngroove formed by the apposition of the large and external small\r\nmetatarsals, inclines inward between the two, and divides on the lower\r\npart of the posterior face of the large metatarsal bone into the\r\ninternal and external digital arteries. It is not usually accompanied by\r\na vein. Beyond this the arterial arrangement is the same as in the\r\nthoracic limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE VEINS[168]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PULMONARY VEINS\r\n\r\nThe terminal =pulmonary veins= (Vv. pulmonales), usually seven or eight\r\nin number, return the aërated blood from the lungs and open into the\r\nleft atrium of the heart. They are destitute of valves. Their\r\ntributaries arise in the capillary plexuses in the lobules of the lungs,\r\nand unite to form larger and larger trunks which accompany the branches\r\nof the bronchi and pulmonary arteries. A very large vein is formed by\r\nthe union at an acute angle of a trunk from each lung, where the latter\r\nare adherent to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SYSTEMIC VEINS\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE VEINS OF THE HEART (Figs. 426, 427)\r\n\r\nThe =coronary sinus= (Sinus coronarius) is a very short bulbous trunk\r\nwhich receives most of the blood from the wall of the heart. It is\r\nsituated just below the termination of the posterior vena cava and is\r\ncovered in part by a thin layer of ventricular muscle-fibers. It opens\r\ninto the right atrium just below the posterior vena cava. It is formed\r\nby the union of two tributaries. The =great cardiac= or =left coronary\r\nvein= (V. cordis magna) begins at the left side of the apex of the\r\nheart, ascends in the left longitudinal groove and turns backward in the\r\ncoronary groove, in which it winds around the posterior border of the\r\nheart to the right side and joins the coronary sinus. The =middle\r\ncardiac= or =right coronary vein= (V. cordis media) begins on the right\r\nside of the apex, ascends in the right longitudinal groove and joins the\r\ncoronary sinus, or opens separately into the atrium just in front of the\r\norifice of the left vein, so that a common trunk (coronary sinus) does\r\nnot then exist.\r\n\r\nThe =small cardiac veins= (Vv. cordis minores), three to five in number,\r\nare small vessels which return some blood from the right ventricle and\r\natrium; they open into the latter near the coronary groove in spaces\r\nbetween the musculi pectinati.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE ANTERIOR VENA CAVA (Fig. 429)\r\n\r\nThe =anterior vena cava= (V. cava cranialis) returns to the heart the\r\nblood from the head, neck, thoracic limbs, and the greater part of the\r\nthoracic wall. It is formed at the ventral part of the thoracic inlet by\r\nthe confluence of the two jugular and two brachial veins. Its origin is\r\nattached to the first pair of ribs. It passes backward in the anterior\r\nmediastinum, at first median and ventral to the common carotid trunk,\r\nthen deviates to the right of the anterior aorta, and opens into the\r\nright atrium opposite to the third rib. The demarcation between vein and\r\natrium is not very distinct. It contains no valves except at the mouths\r\nof its radicles. Its length is about five to six inches (ca. 12 to 15\r\ncm.) and its caliber about two inches (ca. 5 cm.) in a subject of medium\r\nsize. Its right face is crossed by the right phrenic nerve, and on the\r\nleft it is related to the anterior aorta and brachiocephalic artery. It\r\nreceives, in addition to small pericardial and mediastinal veins, the\r\nfollowing tributaries:\r\n\r\n1. The =internal thoracic vein= (V. thoracica interna) is a satellite of\r\nthe artery of that name. It opens into the anterior vena cava at the\r\nfirst rib.\r\n\r\n2. The =vertebral vein= (V. vertebralis) corresponds to the homonymous\r\nartery. On the right side it terminates either in front of the deep\r\ncervical vein or by a short common trunk with it. On the left side it\r\nalmost always unites with the deep cervical and vertebral vein to form a\r\ncommon trunk.\r\n\r\n3. The =deep= or =superior cervical vein= (V. cervicalis profunda)\r\ncorresponds to the artery. On the right side it leaves the artery at the\r\nfirst intercostal space, crosses the right face of the trachea and opens\r\ninto the vena cava; it may form a common trunk with the dorsal or\r\nvertebral. On the left side there is nearly always a common trunk for\r\nall three.\r\n\r\n4. The =dorsal vein= (V. costo-cervicalis) corresponds to the artery. On\r\nthe right side it leaves the artery on entering the thorax, crosses the\r\nright face of the trachea, and opens into the vena cava in front of the\r\ndeep cervical or by a common trunk with it. On the left side it almost\r\nalways joins the deep cervical and vertebral to form a short common\r\ntrunk which crosses the left face of the intrathoracic part of the\r\nbrachial artery opposite the second rib and opens into the anterior vena\r\ncava.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE VENA AZYGOS\r\n\r\nThe =vena azygos= (Fig. 429) is an unpaired vessel which arises at the\r\nlevel of the first lumbar vertebra by radicles coming from the psoas and\r\nthe crura of the diaphragm; it is connected with the first lumbar vein.\r\nIt passes forward along the right side of the bodies of the thoracic\r\nvertebræ, in contact usually with the thoracic duct, which separates the\r\nvein from the aorta. At the seventh vertebra it leaves the spine, curves\r\ndownward and forward over the right side of the thoracic duct, trachea,\r\nand œsophagus, and opens into the right atrium opposite the third\r\nintercostal space. Its tributaries are:\r\n\r\n1. The last fourteen =intercostal veins= (Vv. intercostales) of the\r\nright side. On the left side the last four to seven intercostal veins\r\nusually empty into the =vena hemiazygos=. This vessel runs on the left\r\nside of the aorta from the fourteenth to the eleventh thoracic vertebra,\r\npasses between the aorta and the spine, and joins the vena azygos. In\r\nits absence its tributaries join the vena azygos.\r\n\r\n2. The =œsophageal vein= (V. œsophagea), satellite of the œsophageal\r\nartery, joins the vena azygos as it inclines downward.\r\n\r\n3. The =bronchial vein= (Vena bronchialis) unites with the preceding to\r\nform a short common trunk (Ellenberger-Baum), or empties into the great\r\ncoronary vein (Chauveau).[169]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       VEINS OF THE HEAD AND NECK\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JUGULAR VEINS\r\n\r\nThe =jugular veins= (Vv. jugulares), right and left (Fig. 431), arise\r\nbehind the posterior border of the lower jaw about two and a half inches\r\n(ca. 6 to 7 cm.) below the temporo-maxillary articulation by the union\r\nof the superficial temporal and internal maxillary veins. Each passes\r\ndownward and backward, at first embedded more or less in the parotid\r\ngland, and continues in the jugular furrow to the thoracic inlet, where\r\nit unites with its fellow and the two brachial veins to form the\r\nanterior vena cava. In the neck it is covered by the skin, fascia, and\r\npanniculus, and is superficial to the carotid artery, from which it is\r\nseparated in the anterior two-thirds of the region by the omo-hyoideus\r\nmuscle.[170] It contains valves at the mouths of its tributaries and has\r\nseveral pairs of semilunar valves variably disposed along its course.\r\nIts tributaries are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =internal maxillary vein= (V. maxillaris interna) is larger than\r\nthe external maxillary. It may be considered to begin as the\r\ncontinuation backward of the buccinator vein where the vessel crosses\r\nthe alveolar border of the mandible (about two inches (ca. 5 cm.) behind\r\nthe last molar tooth). It runs backward on the inner surface of the\r\nramus below the external pterygoid and covered by the internal pterygoid\r\nmuscle for a distance of about three inches (ca. 7 to 8 cm.), then\r\ninclines a little downward and runs ventral to the artery for about an\r\ninch (ca. 2 to 3 cm.). It crosses the external face of the artery at the\r\nposterior border of the jaw, and is joined by the superficial temporal\r\nvein to form the jugular. Its principal radicles are:\r\n\r\n(1) The =dorsal lingual vein= (V. dorsalis linguæ), which is a satellite\r\nof the lingual nerve.\r\n\r\n(2) The =inferior alveolar= or =dental vein= (V. alveolaris mandibulæ),\r\na satellite of the corresponding artery. It often unites with the\r\npreceding.\r\n\r\n(3) =Pterygoid veins= (Rami pterygoidei).\r\n\r\n(4) The =deep temporal vein= (V. temporalis profunda) is a large vessel\r\nwhich receives tributaries from the temporalis muscle and emissaries\r\nfrom the parieto-temporal canal. It is connected with the anterior\r\ncerebral vein and usually with the meningeal veins by its frontal\r\nbranch. The latter drains chiefly the lacrimal gland and passes behind\r\nthe supraorbital process.\r\n\r\n2. The =superficial temporal vein= (V. temporalis superficialis) is a\r\nsatellite of the corresponding artery. It is formed by the confluence of\r\nthe =anterior auricular= and =transverse facial veins=. The former\r\nreceives the =superior cerebral vein= (V. cerebralis dorsalis), which is\r\nthe emissary of the transverse sinus of the dura mater; it emerges from\r\nthe parieto-temporal canal behind the postglenoid process. The\r\n=transverse facial vein= (V. transversa faciei) runs at first above the\r\nartery of like name, then plunges deeply into the masseter and unites in\r\nfront with the facial vein. It is connected with the vena reflexa.\r\n\r\n3. The =inferior masseteric= or =maxillo-muscular vein= (V. masseterica)\r\njoins the jugular at the upper border of the sterno-cephalicus tendon.\r\nIt is a short trunk formed by the confluence at the posterior border of\r\nthe jaw of masseteric and pterygoid veins. The former is usually\r\nconnected by a large branch with the buccinator vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 461.—SUPERFICIAL VESSELS AND NERVES OF HEAD AND ANTERIOR PART OF\r\n    NECK OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Masseter; _b_, parotid gland; _c_, parotido-auricularis; _1_,\r\n    masseteric artery; _2_, parotid branch; _3_, transverse facial\r\n    artery; _4_, facial artery; _5_, _6_, inferior labial artery; _7_,\r\n    superior labial artery; _8_, lateral nasal artery; _9_, infraorbital\r\n    artery; _10_, dorsal nasal artery; _11_, angular artery of eye;\r\n    _12_, _13_, jugular vein; _14_, great auricular vein; _15_,\r\n    masseteric vein; _16_, superficial temporal vein; _17_, transverse\r\n    facial vein; _17′_, deep temporal vein; _18_, external maxillary\r\n    vein; _19_, facial vein; _20_, labial vein; _21_, dorsal nasal vein;\r\n    _22_, lateral nasal vein; _23_, angular vein of eye; _24_, _25_,\r\n    facial nerve; _25′_, _25″_, superior and inferior buccal nerves;\r\n    _26_, transverse facial nerve; _27_, auriculo-palpebral nerve; _28_,\r\n    anterior auricular nerve; _29_, cervical branch of facial nerve;\r\n    _30_, ventral branch of second cervical nerve; _30′_, _30″_, _30‴_,\r\n    auricular and cutaneous branches of _30_; _31_, branches of dorsal\r\n    division of first and second cervical nerves; _32_, dorsal branch of\r\n    spinal accessory nerve. (After Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n4. The =great auricular vein= (V. auricularis magna) is a satellite of\r\nthe posterior auricular artery above, but joins the jugular a variable\r\ndistance below and behind the point of origin of the artery.\r\n\r\n5. The =inferior cerebral vein= (V. cerebralis ventralis) is an emissary\r\nof the cavernous sinus of the dura. It is a satellite of the internal\r\ncarotid artery, receives the =condyloid vein=, and joins the jugular\r\nnear the occipital vein or by a common trunk with it.\r\n\r\n6. The =occipital vein= (V. occipitalis) arises in the fossa atlantis by\r\nthe union of muscular and cerebrospinal branches. The former comes from\r\nthe muscles of the poll and passes through the foramen transversarium.\r\nThe latter is connected with the occipital sinus of the dura mater and\r\nemerges from the spinal canal by the intervertebral foramen.\r\n\r\n7. The =external maxillary= or =facial vein= (V. maxillaris externa)\r\narises by radicles which correspond in general to the branches of the\r\nartery of like name. It passes down over the cheek along the anterior\r\nborder of the masseter muscle behind the artery, crossing over the\r\nparotid duct, which lies behind the vein lower down. Thus on the ramus\r\nand as they turn around its lower border the artery is in front, the\r\nvein in the middle, and the duct posterior. In the submaxillary space\r\nthe vein is ventral to the artery for some distance, then parts company\r\nwith the artery, runs straight backward along the lower border of the\r\nparotid gland, and opens into the jugular vein at the posterior angle of\r\nthe gland.[171] The chief differences in the tributaries of the vein as\r\ncompared with the branches of the corresponding artery are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe =labial veins= (Vv. labiales) form a plexus in the submucous tissue\r\nof the cheek from which two veins emerge. The upper one passes back and\r\njoins the buccinator vein. The lower one (V. labialis communis) joins\r\nthe external maxillary vein.\r\n\r\nThree veins connect with the external maxillary at the anterior border\r\nof the masseter.\r\n\r\nThe upper one is the =transverse facial=, which unites close to the end\r\nof the facial crest.\r\n\r\nA little lower is the large valveless =vena reflexa= or =alveolar vein=.\r\nThis passes back under the upper part of the masseter on the maxilla,\r\nturns around the tuber maxillare, perforates the periorbita, and joins\r\nthe ophthalmic vein. It is relatively small at each end, but presents\r\none or two large fusiform dilatations. It receives the following\r\ntributaries: (_a_) The =palatine vein= (V. palatina major), which\r\nseparates from the palatine artery at the anterior palatine foramen and\r\npasses in the groove between the tuber maxillare and the palate bone.\r\nThe palatine veins form a very rich plexus of valveless vessels in the\r\nsubmucosa of the hard palate, which consists of several layers\r\nanteriorly. (_b_) The =sphenopalatine vein= (V. sphenopalatina) forms a\r\nrich plexus of valveless vessels on the turbinal bones and the septum\r\nnasi. It is usually joined by the =infraorbital vein= (V.\r\ninfraorbitalis) to form a short common trunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 462.—DISSECTION OF SUBMAXILLARY SPACE AND ADJACENT PART OF NECK\r\n    OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Ramus of mandible; _b_, sterno-cephalicus muscle; _c_, _c′_,\r\n    omo-hyoidei and sterno-hyoidei (portion removed on right side); _d_,\r\n    hyoid bone; _e_, anterior belly of digastricus; _f_, _g_,\r\n    mylo-hyoideus; _h_, submaxillary lymph glands (portion removed on\r\n    right side); _i_, parotid gland; _k_, submaxillary gland; _l_, chin;\r\n    _m_, stylo-maxillaris; _1_, parotid duct; _2_, facial vein; _3_,\r\n    facial artery; _4_, external maxillary vein; _5_, sublingual vein;\r\n    _6_, sublingual artery; _7_, ventral branch of first cervical nerve;\r\n    _8_, mylo-hyoid nerve.

On the septum a little below its middle and on the\r\n  turbinals the veins are in several layers. The olfactory region does\r\n  not share in this arrangement and the veins here are small and join\r\n  the ethmoidal vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) The =ophthalmic vein= (V. ophthalmica) is a short trunk, connected\r\nin front with the vena reflexa and behind with the cavernous sinus\r\nthrough the foramen lacerum orbitale. It receives veins which correspond\r\nto the arterial branches.\r\n\r\nThe =buccinator vein= (V. buccinatoria) extends backward from the\r\nexternal maxillary along the lower border of the depressor labii\r\ninferioris and buccinator under cover of the masseter, passes between\r\nthe ramus of the mandible and the tuber maxillare and is continued as\r\nthe internal maxillary vein. It has a large fusiform dilatation and is\r\nvalveless. It receives a large common labial vein from the labial\r\nplexus, and is usually connected with the masseteric vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 463.—DEEPER VESSELS AND NERVES OF HEAD OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The parotid gland, most of the masseter muscle, and a portion of the\r\n    ramus of the mandible are removed. _a_, Remnant of masseter muscle;\r\n    _b_, internal pterygoid muscle; _c_, stylo-mandibularis; _d_, _d′_,\r\n    levator labii superioris proprius (portion removed); _e_,\r\n    periorbita; _1_, masseteric artery; _1′_, parotid branch; _2_, trunk\r\n    for anterior (_3_) and posterior (_4_) auricular arteries; _5_,\r\n    _5′_, superficial temporal artery; _5″_, transverse facial artery;\r\n    _6_, inferior alveolar (or dental) artery; _6′_, mental continuation\r\n    of _6_; _7_, buccinator artery; _8_, infraorbital artery; _9_, _11_,\r\n    jugular vein; _10_, external maxillary vein; _12_, inferior cerebral\r\n    vein; _13_, facial vein; _14_, angular vein of eye; _15_, dorsal\r\n    nasal vein; _16_, lateral nasal vein; _17_, superior labial vein;\r\n    _18_, _19_, inferior labial veins; _20_, labial plexus; _21_, _22_,\r\n    emergent veins of plexus; _23_, vena reflexa; _24_, trunk of\r\n    sphenopalatine and infraorbital veins; _25_, palatine vein; _26_,\r\n    great auricular vein; _27_, _28_, superficial temporal vein; _29_,\r\n    transverse facial vein; _30_, buccinator vein; _31_, dorsal lingual\r\n    vein; _32_, inferior alveolar or dental vein; _33_, pterygoid vein;\r\n    _34_, deep temporal vein; _35_, superior cerebral vein; _36_,\r\n    external nasal nerve; _37_, anterior nasal nerve; _38_, superior\r\n    labial nerve; _39_, masseteric nerve; _39′_, end branches of _39_;\r\n    _40_, buccinator nerve; _41_, pterygoid nerve; _41a_, inferior\r\n    alveolar or dental nerve; _41b_, mylo-hyoid nerve; _42_, posterior\r\n    auricular nerve; _43_, auricular branch of vagus; _44_, internal\r\n    auricular nerve; _45_, auriculo-palpebral nerve (cut); _46_,\r\n    digastric nerve. (After Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lingual vein= (V. lingualis) is not a satellite of the artery. It\r\nis formed at the side of the lingual process of the hyoid bone by the\r\nconfluence of several veins which come from the substance of the tongue.\r\nOne or two considerable vessels run partly in the substance of the\r\nhyo-glossus, and another in the genio-hyoideus. The vein is at first\r\ncovered by the mylo-hyoideus, perforates that muscle, runs back along\r\nthe omo-hyoideus in relation to the submaxillary lymph glands, and joins\r\nthe external maxillary near the posterior border of the jaw. Near its\r\ntermination it receives the =sublingual vein=, or the latter may open\r\ninto the external maxillary directly.\r\n\r\n8. The =thyroid vein= (V. thyreoidea) is a large vessel which joins the\r\njugular near the external maxillary vein. It receives anterior thyroid,\r\nlaryngeal, and pharyngeal radicles, and sometimes a posterior thyroid\r\nvein.\r\n\r\n9. =Muscular=, =tracheal=, and =œsophageal= veins.\r\n\r\n10. The =cephalic vein= (Vena cephalica) enters the jugular near its\r\ntermination. It will be described with the veins of the thoracic limb.\r\n\r\n11. The =inferior cervical vein= (V. cervicalis ascendens) accompanies\r\nthe artery. It may open into the brachial vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE SINUSES OF THE DURA MATER\r\n\r\nThese (Sinus duræ matris) are blood-spaces between the meningeal and\r\nperiosteal layers of the dura mater and are lined with endothelium. In\r\nmany places the lumen is crossed by fibrous strands. They receive the\r\nveins of the brain, communicate with the meningeal and diploic veins,\r\nand with veins outside of the cranium; their connections with the latter\r\nare by means of small =emissary veins= (Emissaria). They convey the\r\nblood directly or indirectly to the jugular veins. Some are paired,\r\nothers unpaired. They may be divided into dorsal and basilar systems.\r\nThe =dorsal system= comprises the following:\r\n\r\nThe =superior longitudinal= or =sagittal sinus= (S. sagittalis superior)\r\nis situated in the upper border of the falx cerebri along the internal\r\nsagittal crest. It begins at the crista galli and ends at the tentorium\r\nosseum by dividing into two transverse sinuses. It receives the superior\r\ncerebral veins. Along each side are small pouches (Lacunæ laterales)\r\ninto which the veins open. The lumen of the sinus is traversed by\r\nfibrous bands and is partially divided by a longitudinal septum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 464.—MEDIAN SECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE, UPPER PART WITH SEPTUM NASI\r\n    REMOVED.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Lateral mass of ethmoid bone; _b_, superior turbinal; _c_,\r\n    inferior turbinal; _d_, _d′_, turbinal folds; _e_, frontal sinus;\r\n    _f_, falx cerebri; _g_, tentorium cerebelli; _h_, medial surface of\r\n    hemisphere; _i_, cerebellum; _k_, occipital bone; _k′_, occipital\r\n    condyle; _k″_, paramastoid process; _l_, external auditory meatus;\r\n    _m_, temporal condyle; _n_, parieto-temporal canal; _1_, branches of\r\n    ethmoidal artery; _2_, _2′_, branches of sphenopalatine artery; _3_,\r\n    _3′_, branches of sphenopalatine vein; _4_, branches of ethmoidal\r\n    nerve; _5_, _5′_, branches of sphenopalatine nerve; _6_, artery of\r\n    corpus callosum; _7_, superior sagittal sinus; _8_, straight sinus;\r\n    _9_, vena magna cerebri; _10_, inferior sagittal sinus; _11_, _11′_,\r\n    transverse sinuses; _12_, superior petrosal sinus; _13_, superior\r\n    occipital sinus; _14_, superior cerebral vein; _15_, corpus\r\n    callosum; _16_, fornix.

The two sinuses are connected\r\nby the sinus communicans.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior longitudinal= or =sagittal sinus= (S. sagittalis inferior)\r\nruns backward on the upper surface of the corpus callosum along the\r\nconcave edge of the falx cerebri and joins the great cerebral vein (of\r\nGalen) to form the straight sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =straight sinus= (S. rectus) passes upward and backward between the\r\ncerebral hemispheres and in the tentorium cerebelli and joins the\r\nsuperior sagittal sinus. The point of meeting is the confluence of the\r\nsinuses (Confluens sinuum).\r\n\r\nThe =occipital sinuses= (S. occipitales) lie on either side of the\r\nvermis cerebelli. They empty anteriorly into the sinus communicans and\r\ncommunicate behind with the spinal veins.\r\n\r\nThe =superior petrosal sinuses= (S. petrosi superiores) pass in the\r\ntentorium cerebelli to end in the transverse sinuses.\r\n\r\nThe =basilar system= consists of the following:\r\n\r\nThe =cavernous sinuses= (S. cavernosi) lie in the inner grooves of the\r\nroot of the temporal wings of the sphenoid bone at either side of the\r\nsella turcica. The two are connected by a wide traverse branch (Sinus\r\nintercavernosus) behind and below the posterior part of the pituitary\r\nbody. Each is continuous in front with the ophthalmic vein and below\r\nwith the inferior petrosal sinus. The third, sixth, and the ophthalmic\r\nand maxillary divisions of the fifth nerve lie along the outer wall of\r\nthe sinus. The internal carotid artery traverses the sinus and is\r\nconnected with its fellow by a transverse branch which lies in the\r\ncorresponding part of the sinus. An oval opening in the floor\r\ncommunicates with the inferior petrosal sinus and transmits the internal\r\ncarotid artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The sinus is not subdivided by strands of fibrous tissue as in man,\r\n  but a few delicate bands attach the artery to its wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =inferior petrosal sinuses= (S. petrosi inferiores)[172] lie along\r\nthe borders of the basilar part of the occipital bone, inclosed in the\r\nthick dura which closes the foramen lacerum. The anterior part extends\r\nabout half an inch (ca. 12 mm.) under the temporal wing of the sphenoid.\r\nHere communications exist with veins in the pterygo-palatine fossa. The\r\nposterior end is bulbous and lies in the condyloid fossa; it\r\ncommunicates with the condyloid vein issuing from the hypoglossal\r\nforamen and is drained by the inferior cerebral vein; it also receives\r\nan emissary vein from the parieto-temporal canal. The roof of the sinus\r\nis perforated by an oval opening at the carotid notch which opens into\r\nthe cavernous sinus and transmits the internal carotid artery; the\r\nlatter forms the first bend of its =S=-shaped curve in the petrosal and\r\nthe second in the cavernous sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =basilar plexus= (Plexus basilaris) is a venous plexus situated on\r\nthe upper surface of the basilar part of the occipital bone. It is\r\nconnected through the hypoglossal foramen with the inferior petrosal\r\nsinus and communicates behind with the spinal veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE VEINS OF THE CRANIUM\r\n\r\nThe =veins of the brain= (Venæ cerebri) do not in general accompany the\r\ncerebral arteries. They have very thin walls, no muscular coat, and no\r\nvalves. They are arranged in two sets, superficial or cortical and deep\r\nor central. The superficial veins are more numerous and larger than the\r\narteries. They lie on the surface of the brain in the pia mater and the\r\nsubarachnoid space.\r\n\r\nThe =superior cerebral veins= drain the upper and outer part of the\r\ncerebral cortex. They receive veins from the medial surfaces of the\r\nhemispheres and open into the superior sagittal sinus. Their terminal\r\nparts are bulbous and their openings are directed obliquely forward, _i.\r\ne._, contrary to the direction of the bloodstream in the sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior cerebral veins= lie on the inferior and external aspect of\r\nthe hemispheres. They open into the inferior system of sinuses. The\r\n=middle cerebral vein= runs in the lateral fissure (of Sylvius) and\r\nopens into the cavernous sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =deep cerebral veins= issue from the central or ganglionic parts of\r\nthe brain at the transverse fissure. They converge to form the =great\r\ncerebral vein= (of Galen) (V. magna cerebri). This passes upward and\r\nbackward behind the splenium of the corpus callosum and is continued as\r\nthe straight sinus to join the sagittal sinus.\r\n\r\nThe =superior cerebellar veins= ramify on the upper surface of the\r\ncerebellum. They open into the superior system of sinuses and the great\r\ncerebral vein. The =inferior cerebellar veins= are larger and go chiefly\r\nto the basilar plexus. The veins of the medulla and pons end in the\r\ninferior system of sinuses.\r\n\r\nThe =meningeal veins= (Venæ meningeæ) arise in capillary plexuses in the\r\nsuperficial and deep faces of the dura mater. Some end in the sinuses of\r\nthe dura, others accompany the meningeal arteries.\r\n\r\nThe =diploic veins= (Venæ diploicæ) are anastomosing channels in the\r\nspongy substance of the cranial bones. Their walls are thin, consisting\r\nin many places only of the endothelium, and they have no valves. Some\r\nopen inward into venous sinuses, others into extracranial veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SPINAL VEINS\r\n\r\nTwo =longitudinal spinal veins= or =sinuses= (Sinus columnæ vertebralis)\r\nextend along the floor of the vertebral canal, one on either side of the\r\nsuperior common ligament. They are continuous in front with the basilar\r\nplexus. They lie in the grooves on the bodies of the vertebræ and are\r\nconnected by a series of transverse anastomoses which pass between the\r\ncentral part of the bodies of the vertebræ and the superior common\r\nligament or in channels in the bone. They receive veins from the spinal\r\ncord, the dura mater, and the bodies of the vertebræ (Venæ basis\r\nvertebræ). Through the intervertebral foramina efferent vessels connect\r\nwith the vertebral, intercostal, lumbar, and lateral sacral veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       VEINS OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =brachial vein= (V. brachialis) is a satellite of the extrathoracic\r\npart of the brachial artery. It arises at the inner side of the distal\r\nend of the shaft of the humerus and passes upward in the arm behind the\r\nartery under cover of a layer of fascia and the posterior superficial\r\npectoral muscle. At the shoulder it is ventral to the artery, crosses\r\nthe anterior border of the first rib, and concurs with its fellow and\r\nthe two jugulars in the formation of the anterior vena cava. The roots\r\nof the vein are somewhat variable, but most often four radial veins in\r\naddition to a large oblique branch from the cephalic unite in its\r\nformation. Its tributaries correspond in general to the branches of the\r\nartery, but a few differences are worthy of notice. The\r\n=thoracico-dorsal vein= joins the brachial directly or opens into the\r\ndeep brachial. The =external thoracic= or =“spur” vein= (V. thoracica\r\nexterna) is a large vessel which arises in the ventral wall of the\r\nabdomen, passes forward (embedded more or less in the panniculus) along\r\nthe outer border of the posterior deep pectoral muscle, and joins the\r\nbrachial vein near the first rib. It often communicates with the\r\nsubscapular vein.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 465.—SPINAL VESSELS OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The vertebral canal has been opened by sawing off the arches.

(After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s\r\n    Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =cephalic vein= (V. cephalica) arises at the inner side of the\r\ncarpus as the continuation of the internal superficial metacarpal vein.\r\nIt runs upward on the deep fascia of the forearm at first in the furrow\r\nbetween the flexor carpi internus and the radius. Toward the middle of\r\nthe forearm it inclines gradually forward on the inner surface of the\r\nradius, accompanied by a cutaneous branch of the median nerve, and\r\narrives at the insertion of the biceps. Here it detaches a large branch\r\n(Ramus communicans) which passes upward and backward over the inner\r\ninsertion of the biceps, the posterior radial artery, and the median\r\nnerve, and joins the brachial vein. The vein to this point is often\r\ntermed the internal subcutaneous vein of the forearm (V. cephalica\r\nantebrachii). It is continued (as the V. cephalica humeri) in the furrow\r\nbetween the mastoido-humeralis and the anterior superficial pectoral\r\nwith a branch of the inferior cervical artery, crosses the deep face of\r\nthe cervical panniculus, and opens into the terminal part of the jugular\r\nor the brachial vein. It receives an =accessory cephalic vein= (V.\r\ncephalica accessoria), which arises from the carpal network, runs upward\r\nalong the inner border of the extensor carpi, turns along the lower\r\nborder of the brachialis, passes under the superficial tendon of the\r\nbiceps and joins the cephalic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 466.—DISSECTION OF PECTORAL REGION AND ANTERIOR PART OF ABDOMINAL\r\n    WALL OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Jugular vein; _2_, loose connective tissue of axillary space;\r\n    _3_, ascending branch of inferior cervical artery; _4_, descending\r\n    branch of same; _5_, cephalic vein; _6_, median nerve; _7_, ulnar\r\n    nerve; _8_, brachial artery; _9_, brachial vein; _10_, external\r\n    thoracic or “spur” vein; _11_, anterior abdominal artery and vein;\r\n    _12_, branches of sixth cervical nerve; _13_, cutaneous branch of\r\n    axillary nerve; _14_, cutaneous branch of musculo-cutaneous nerve;\r\n    _15_, cervical panniculus; _16_, sterno-cephalicus; _17_, scalenus;\r\n    _18_, mastoido-humeralis; _19_, anterior superficial pectoral; _20_,\r\n    posterior superficial pectoral; _21_, anterior deep pectoral; _22_,\r\n    posterior deep pectoral; _23_, abdominal panniculus; _24_, obliquus\r\n    abdominis externus; _25_, rectus abdominis; _26_, coraco-brachialis;\r\n    _27_, tensor fasciæ antibrachii; _a_, prescapular lymph glands; _b_,\r\n    prepectoral lymph glands; _c_, axillary lymph glands; _d_, cubital\r\n    lymph glands; _c.x._, xiphoid cartilage. (After Schmaltz, Atlas d.\r\n    Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe deep veins of the forearm are variable. Commonly two =posterior\r\nradial veins= (Venæ medianoradiales) accompany the artery of like name,\r\none in front and one behind. A third vein arises by radicles emerging\r\nfrom the proximal part of the deep flexor; it joins the posterior\r\nsatellite of the posterior radial artery or forms one of the roots of\r\nthe brachial vein. The =common interosseous vein= joins the posterior\r\nsatellite. The =anterior radial vein= (V. collateralis radialis) is a\r\nsatellite of the artery. The =ulnar vein= is usually double at its\r\nproximal part, and communicates with the deep brachial vein.\r\n\r\nThere are three chief =metacarpal veins=. The =internal metacarpal vein=\r\n(V. metacarpea volaris superficialis medialis) arises from the volar\r\nvenous arch above the fetlock. It is the largest vein of the region and\r\nlies in front of the large metacarpal artery. It separates from the\r\nartery at the proximal end of the metacarpus, passes upward on the inner\r\npart of the posterior surface of the carpus, under cover of the\r\nsuperficial layer of the posterior annular ligament, and is continued as\r\nthe cephalic vein. It communicates at its proximal part with the origin\r\nof the posterior radial veins by a short but relatively large branch.\r\nThe =external metacarpal vein= (V. metacarpea volaris superficialis\r\nlateralis) arises from the venous arch above the fetlock and passes\r\nupward behind the external border of the suspensory ligament in front of\r\nthe external branch of the median nerve and accompanied by a small\r\nartery. At the proximal end of the metacarpus it is connected with the\r\ndeep metacarpal vein by two transverse anastomoses which pass across the\r\nsuspensory ligament. It then passes upward as a satellite of the\r\nexternal volar metacarpal artery and concurs in the origin of the ulnar\r\nand posterior radial veins. The =deep metacarpal vein= (V. metacarpea\r\nvolaris profunda medialis) arises from the venous arch, passes forward\r\nbetween the two branches of the suspensory ligament, and ascends on the\r\nposterior surface of the large metacarpal bone. At the proximal end of\r\nthe latter it communicates with the other metacarpal veins, ascends with\r\nthe small metacarpal artery, and concurs in forming the radial veins.\r\n\r\nThe =venous arch= (Arcus venosus volaris), from which the metacarpal\r\nveins arise, is situated above the sesamoids of the fetlock between the\r\nsuspensory ligament and the deep flexor tendon. It is formed by the\r\njunction of the two digital veins.\r\n\r\nThe =digital veins=, internal and external (V. digitalis medialis,\r\nlateralis), drain the venous plexuses of the foot. They arise at the\r\nupper edge of the lateral cartilages and ascend in front of the\r\ncorresponding arteries.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to recognize the following venous plexuses of the foot,\r\nwhich, however, communicate very freely:\r\n\r\n1. The =coronary plexus= encircles the upper part of the foot. It is\r\nattached to the terminal part of the extensor tendon, the lateral\r\ncartilages, and the bulbs of the plantar cushion.\r\n\r\n2. The =dorsal= (or laminal) =plexus= covers the dorsal or wall surface\r\nof the third phalanx in the deep layer of the matrix of the wall of the\r\nhoof. It forms the circumflex vein of the third phalanx or vein of the\r\ndistal border of the third phalanx, which corresponds to the artery of\r\nlike name.\r\n\r\n3. The =volar plexus= is in the deep layer of the matrix of the sole of\r\nthe hoof and on the deep surface of the lateral cartilages. It\r\ncommunicates around the inferior border of the third phalanx with the\r\ndorsal plexus and through the lateral cartilages with the coronary\r\nplexus.\r\n\r\nThe deep vein of the third phalanx accompanies the terminal part of the\r\ndigital artery. It drains the =intraosseous plexus=.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE POSTERIOR VENA CAVA (Figs. 270, 450)\r\n\r\nThe =posterior vena cava= (V. cava caudalis) returns almost all of the\r\nblood from the abdomen, pelvis, and pelvic limbs. It is formed by the\r\nconfluence of the right and left common iliac veins at the fifth lumbar\r\nvertebra, above the terminal part of the aorta and chiefly to the right\r\nof the median plane.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The mode of origin is variable. In some cases there is a common trunk\r\n  formed by the union of the two internal iliac veins so that the\r\n  arrangement resembles the termination of the aorta. In other cases the\r\n  internal iliac vein does not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt passes forward on the ventral face of the psoas minor to the right of\r\nthe abdominal aorta. At the last thoracic vertebra it separates from the\r\naorta and runs forward between the right crus of the diaphragm and the\r\npancreas till it reaches the liver. Here it inclines downward along the\r\ninner border of the right lobe and the parietal surface of the liver,\r\nlargely embedded in the gland substance, and passes through the foramen\r\nvenæ cavæ of the diaphragm. It then runs forward and somewhat downward\r\nbetween the mediastinal lobe and the main mass of the right lung at the\r\nupper margin of a special fold of the right pleura, accompanied by the\r\nright phrenic nerve, and opens into the posterior part of the right\r\natrium. It receives the following tributaries:\r\n\r\n1. The =lumbar veins= (Vv. lumbales) correspond to the arteries. Five\r\npairs usually empty into the vena cava. Sometimes the corresponding\r\nveins of opposite sides unite to form a common trunk. The first\r\ncommunicate with the vena azygos.\r\n\r\n2. The =spermatic veins= (Vv. spermaticæ internæ) (Fig. 450) accompany\r\nthe arteries of like name. In the spermatic cord they form the\r\npampiniform plexus about the artery and nerves. Their termination is\r\nvariable. The right one commonly joins the vena cava near the renal\r\nvein, often by a common trunk with the left one. Frequently the left\r\nvein joins the left renal, and sometimes the right one ends similarly.\r\n\r\n2_a_. The =utero-ovarian veins= are much larger than the preceding and\r\nare satellites of the arteries in the broad ligaments. The ovarian\r\nbranch is plexiform near the ovary. The uterine branches form a rich\r\nplexus in the wall of the uterus. The trunk is very short.\r\n\r\n3. The =renal veins= (Vv. renales), satellites of the arteries, are of\r\nlarge caliber and thin-walled. The right vein passes inward and backward\r\non the ventral face of the kidney between the artery in front and the\r\nureter behind. It joins the vena cava above the right adrenal. The left\r\nvein is somewhat longer. It passes inward at first like the right one,\r\nthen bends around the posterior end of the adrenal, crosses the origin\r\nof the renal artery and opens into the vena cava a little further back\r\nthan the right one. They receive veins from the adrenals, but some\r\nadrenal veins open directly into the vena cava.\r\n\r\n4. The =hepatic veins= (Vv. hepaticæ) return the blood from the liver,\r\nand open into the vena cava as it lies in the groove in the liver. Three\r\nor four large vessels open into the vena cava just before it leaves the\r\nliver, and numerous small ones discharge into its embedded part.\r\n\r\n5. The =phrenic veins= (Vv. phrenicæ), two or three in number, return\r\nthe blood from the diaphragm. They are very large in comparison with the\r\narteries, and join the vena cava as it lies in the caval opening.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some cases there is a small middle sacral vein (V. sacralis media),\r\n  a satellite of the artery. It opens into the angle of junction of the\r\n  common iliac veins or into one of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE PORTAL VEIN\r\n\r\nThe =portal vein= (V. portæ) is a large trunk which returns the blood\r\ncarried to the viscera by the gastric, splenic, and mesenteric arteries.\r\nIts peripheral tributaries correspond closely with the branches of the\r\narteries, but the terminal trunks do not. The vein is formed behind the\r\npancreas and below the posterior vena cava by the confluence of the\r\n=anterior= and =posterior mesenteric= and =splenic veins=. It passes\r\nforward, traverses the posterior part of the pancreas very obliquely,\r\ninclines ventrally and a little to the right, and reaches the portal\r\nfissure of the liver. Here it divides into three branches which enter\r\nthe liver and ramify in the substance of the gland like an artery,\r\nterminating in the lobular capillaries. From the lobules the blood\r\npasses into the hepatic veins and through these to the posterior vena\r\ncava. Thus the blood which is distributed to the stomach, nearly the\r\nentire intestinal tract, the pancreas, and the spleen, passes through\r\ntwo sets of capillaries prior to its return to the heart, viz., the\r\ncapillaries of these viscera and of the liver.\r\n\r\n1. The =anterior mesenteric vein= (V. mesenterica cranialis) is the\r\nlargest of the portal radicles. It is situated to the right of the\r\nartery of like name, and its tributaries correspond in general to the\r\nbranches of the artery. Usually a single colic vein corresponds to the\r\ntwo arteries of the right portions of the colon.\r\n\r\n2. The =posterior mesenteric vein= (V. mesenterica caudalis) is the\r\nsmallest of the radicles of the portal. It accompanies the artery in the\r\ncolic mesentery and its rectal branches anastomose with those of the\r\ninternal pudic vein.\r\n\r\n3. The =splenic vein= (V. lienalis) is the very large satellite of the\r\nsplenic artery. It is formed by the union of two radicles at the base of\r\nthe spleen. On leaving the hilus of the spleen it passes inward between\r\nthe anterior pole of the left kidney and the saccus cæcus of the stomach\r\nand above the left end of the pancreas, receives commonly the =posterior\r\ngastric vein= (V. gastrica caudalis), and unites with the anterior\r\nmesenteric at the posterior border of the pancreas.\r\n\r\nThe collateral tributaries of the portal veins are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) =Pancreatic veins= (Rami pancreatici).\r\n\r\n(2) The =gastro-duodenal vein= (V. gastroduodenalis) corresponds mainly\r\nto the extrahepatic branches of the hepatic artery.\r\n\r\n(3) The =anterior gastric vein= (V. gastrica cranialis) joins the portal\r\nat the portal fissure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE COMMON ILIAC VEINS (Fig. 456)\r\n\r\nThese (V. iliacæ communes) are two very large but short trunks which\r\nresult from the union of the internal and external iliac veins of each\r\nside at the sacro-iliac articulation. The left one is the longer and\r\ncrosses obliquely over the terminal part of the aorta. The chief\r\ntributaries of each are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The last =lumbar vein=.\r\n\r\n2. The =circumflex iliac veins= (Vv. circumflexæ ilium profundæ) are the\r\ntwo satellites of each corresponding artery, on either side of which\r\nthey are placed. They may open directly into the posterior vena cava or\r\ninto the external iliac vein.\r\n\r\n3. The =ilio-lumbar vein= (V. iliolumbalis) may open into the common\r\niliac, the external iliac, or the internal iliac vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE INTERNAL ILIAC VEINS\r\n\r\nThe =internal iliac= or =hypogastric veins= (Vv. hypogastricæ), right\r\nand left, are usually formed by the confluence of lateral sacral,\r\ngluteal, and internal pudic veins. The obturator vein may open into them\r\nalso. They are short trunks and are smaller than the external iliac\r\nveins. The tributaries correspond in general to the branches of the\r\nthree arteries of like names. The internal pudic veins receive affluents\r\nfrom the venous plexuses of the prepuce and penis in the male; of the\r\nmammary gland, vulva, vagina, and vestibular bulb in the female.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE VEINS OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =external iliac vein= (V. iliaca externa) (Figs. 450, 451) lies\r\nbehind the corresponding artery at the brim of the pelvis. It is the\r\nupward continuation of the femoral vein, and unites at the sacro-iliac\r\njoint with the internal iliac to form the common iliac vein. Its\r\ntributaries are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =obturator vein= (V. obturatoria) is a satellite of the artery\r\nand usually opens into the external iliac at the insertion of the psoas\r\nminor. Its radicles anastomose with those of the internal and external\r\npudic veins (Figs. 451, 455).\r\n\r\n2. The =iliaco-femoral= or =external circumflex veins= (Vv. circumflexæ\r\nfemoris laterales) are the two satellites of the homonymous artery. They\r\nopen a little higher than the obturator.\r\n\r\nThe =femoral vein= (Figs. 450, 451) lies behind the artery in the upper\r\npart of the thigh, external to it lower down. Its chief tributaries are:\r\n\r\n1. A very large but short trunk formed by the union of the deep femoral\r\nand the external pudic vein. The =deep femoral vein= (V. profunda\r\nfemoris) corresponds otherwise to the artery. The =external pudic vein=\r\n(V. pudenda externa) arises chiefly from a rich plexus of large veins\r\nsituated above and along the sides of the penis and prepuce in the male,\r\nthe mammary glands in the female. It passes through a foramen in the\r\nanterior part of the tendon of origin of the gracilis and runs outward\r\nin the subpubic groove behind the pectineus to unite with the deep\r\nfemoral vein. The right and left veins are connected by a large\r\ntransverse anastomosis and each has a large connection with the\r\nobturator vein. Each receives the =posterior abdominal vein= (V.\r\nepigastrica caudalis) which accompanies the artery of like name. The\r\n=subcutaneous abdominal vein= (V. abdominalis subcutanea) arises in the\r\nskin and panniculus of the ventral abdominal wall, anastomoses with the\r\ninternal and external thoracic and deep abdominal veins, and joins the\r\nexternal pudic or posterior abdominal vein.\r\n\r\nA small vein accompanies the external pudic artery in the inguinal\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\n2. The =anterior femoral vein= (V. femoris cranialis) accompanies the\r\nartery.\r\n\r\n3. The =saphenous vein= (V. saphena) (Figs. 451, 458, 460) arises at the\r\ninner side of the flexion surface of the tarsus as the upward\r\ncontinuation of the internal metatarsal vein. Its course is distinctly\r\nvisible. It ascends on the subcutaneous surface of the tibia and the\r\npopliteus muscle, inclosed between layers of the deep fascia, inclines a\r\nlittle backward to the proximal part of the leg, then deviates slightly\r\nforward, runs upward on the gracilis, passes between that muscle and the\r\nsartorius, and joins the femoral or the external pudic vein.[173] On the\r\nupper part of the capsule of the hock joint it forms an arch with the\r\nanterior tibial vein. The vein has numerous valves. The satellite artery\r\nis relatively small and lies in front of the vein as far as the junction\r\nwith the recurrent tibial vein, which it accompanies on the leg. It\r\nreceives the =recurrent tibial vein= (V. recurrens tibialis)[174] at the\r\nproximal fourth of the leg. This vessel arises at the inner surface of\r\nthe tarsus and forms an arch with the posterior tibial vein at the level\r\nof the tuber calcis. It ascends in the furrow in front of the\r\ngastrocnemius tendon, inclines forward at the proximal third of the leg,\r\nand joins the saphenous vein at an acute angle. It has numerous valves.\r\nA smaller vein from the anterior face of the metatarsus joins the\r\nsaphenous at the hock.\r\n\r\n4. =Muscular branches= which correspond to the arteries.\r\n\r\n5. The =posterior femoral= or =femoro-popliteal= vein (V. femoris\r\ncaudalis) is a satellite of the artery. It receives the =recurrent\r\ntarsal= or =external saphenous vein= (V. tarsea recurrens), which arises\r\nat the outer side of the hock, ascends on the deep fascia of the\r\nexternal surface of the leg in front of the tendo Achillis, passes\r\nbetween the biceps femoris and semitendinosus, and joins the posterior\r\nfemoral vein. It is connected with the recurrent tibial vein by a large\r\nanastomotic branch which crosses in front of the tuber calcis. Usually a\r\nbranch from it ascends along the great sciatic nerve and anastomoses\r\nwith the obturator vein.\r\n\r\nThe =popliteal vein= (V. poplitea) lies along the inner side of the\r\nartery (Fig. 459). It is formed by the confluence of anterior and\r\nposterior tibial veins.\r\n\r\nTwo =anterior tibial veins= (Vv. tibiales anteriores) usually accompany\r\nthe artery of like name; the outer vein is much the larger. In other\r\ncases there is a single large vein in the proximal part of the leg, two\r\nlower down. They arise from a number of anastomosing radicles on the\r\nfront of the capsule of the hock joint, chiefly as the continuation of\r\nthe perforating tarsal vein. The origin of the chief vein is connected\r\nwith the saphenous by a large anastomotic branch.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior tibial vein= (V. tibialis posterior) is commonly double\r\n(Fig. 458). It arises at the level of the tuber calcis, where it has a\r\ncommunication with the recurrent tibial vein. It is a satellite of the\r\nartery.\r\n\r\nThe =internal= or =great metatarsal vein= (V. metatarsea dorsalis\r\nmedialis) (Figs. 458, 460) arises from the venous arch above the\r\nsesamoids at the fetlock, but is practically the upward continuation of\r\nthe internal digital vein. It ascends along the inner border of the deep\r\nflexor tendon, then in the groove on the inner aspect of the proximal\r\npart of the large metatarsal bone to the capsule of the hock joint, and\r\nis continued by the saphenous vein.\r\n\r\nThe =external metatarsal vein= (V. metatarsea plantaris lateralis)\r\narises from the venous arch above the fetlock, but appears to be the\r\nupward continuation of the external digital vein. It ascends along the\r\nouter border of the deep flexor tendon in front of the plantar nerve,\r\nand is connected with the deep metatarsal vein at the proximal part of\r\nthe metatarsus by a transverse branch. It then passes upward along the\r\ndeep flexor tendon in relation to the plantar nerves and the inner\r\ntarsal artery and is continued by the recurrent tibial vein.\r\n\r\nThe =deep metatarsal vein= (V. metatarsea plantaris medialis) arises\r\nfrom the plantar venous arch, passes forward between the branches of the\r\nsuspensory ligament, and ascends on the posterior face of the large\r\nmetatarsal bone. At the proximal end of the metatarsus it is connected\r\nwith the external metatarsal vein by a transverse branch. It then passes\r\n(as the perforating tarsal vein) through the vascular canal of the\r\ntarsus and forms the chief radicle of the anterior tibial vein.\r\n\r\nThe =plantar venous arch= (Arcus venosus plantaris) and the digital\r\nveins are arranged like those of the thoracic limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Lymphatic System\r\n\r\nThe =lymphatic system= (Systema lymphaticum) is subsidiary to the venous\r\npart of the circulatory system, from which it arises in the embryo. It\r\nconsists of the lymph vessels and glands.\r\n\r\nThe =lymph vessels= (Vasa lymphatica) contain a colorless fluid, the\r\nlymph, which contains numerous lymphocytes.[175] They resemble the veins\r\nin structure but have thinner walls and are provided with more numerous\r\nvalves. The vessels are sacculated opposite the segments of the valves\r\nand have a characteristic beaded appearance when distended. The\r\ncollecting lymph vessels do not usually form rich plexuses, as veins\r\noften do, their branching is more limited and less tree-like than that\r\nof the blood-vessels, and their caliber therefore increases less from\r\nthe periphery toward their termination. All of the lymph is ultimately\r\ncarried into the venous system by two trunks, the =thoracic duct= and\r\nthe =right lymphatic duct=. Almost all of the lymph passes through at\r\nleast one group of lymph glands before entering the blood-vascular\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe =lymph glands= or =nodes= (Lymphoglandulæ) are intercalated in the\r\ncourse of the lymph vessels. They vary widely in size, some being\r\nmicroscopic, others several inches in length. In form they may be\r\nglobular, ovoid and flattened, elongated, or irregular. In certain\r\nsituations they are aggregated into groups, and a knowledge of the\r\nposition of these and the territory drained into them is important. It\r\nis convenient, when possible, to indicate their position with regard to\r\narteries on the course of which they are placed. In color they are\r\nusually gray or yellowish-brown in the dead subject, pink or\r\nreddish-brown during life, but this varies according to their position\r\nand functional state. The bronchial glands are often blackened by\r\ninfiltration with carbon. The mesenteric glands are creamy or white\r\nwhile the chyle is passing through, but pink at other times. Vessels\r\nwhich carry lymph to a gland are called =afferent=; the =efferent=\r\nvessels which convey it away are larger and fewer. Each gland has a\r\ndepression, the =hilus=, at which the blood-vessels enter and the\r\nefferent lymph vessels emerge.\r\n\r\n=Lymph nodules= or =follicles= (Noduli lymphatici) are minute masses of\r\nlymphoid tissue which occur in certain mucous membranes. They may be\r\nsolitary, as in the solitary glands of the intestine, or aggregated into\r\nmasses or patches, as in the tonsils and the so-called Peyer’s patches.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The =lymph nodule= or =follicle= is the unit of structure of the lymph\r\n  gland. It consists essentially of an artery surrounded by a\r\n  =reticulum= of connective tissue, the meshes of which contain numerous\r\n  =lymphocytes=. Surrounding this is a rich plexus of lymph vessels,\r\n  forming the so-called =sinus=, inclosed in some cases by a fibrous\r\n  capsule. The gland consists of a mass of follicles, inclosed in a\r\n  fibrous =capsule=, from which =trabeculæ= pass in and unite the\r\n  follicles. Beneath the capsule is the =peripheral sinus=, which\r\n  consists of a very rich plexus of lymph vessels; to this the afferent\r\n  vessels pass at various points of the surface. In the =cortical\r\n  substance= the cells are in rounded masses, the cortical nodules,\r\n  while in the =medullary substance= they lie around the arteries,\r\n  forming the so-called medullary cords. The =medulla= is redder than\r\n  the cortex, since it is more vascular; it contains the =central lymph\r\n  sinuses=, which have a similar structure to the peripheral sinus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =hæmolymph glands= differ from the lymph glands in color and\r\nstructure. They are of a deep red color, which is due to the high\r\nvascularity of the cortical substance. The peripheral sinuses especially\r\nare greatly developed and contain numerous red blood-cells. There is no\r\nclear division into cortical and medullary substance, and the trabeculæ\r\ncontain smooth muscle-cells. Some have afferent and efferent lymph\r\nvessels and others do not. They resemble the spleen in some respects,\r\nbut their significance is not yet clear. They are numerous in the ox and\r\nsheep, much fewer in the dog, and apparently are absent in the horse.\r\nThey occur along the course of the aorta, in the perineal fat, at the\r\nportal fissure, and with the gastric and mesenteric lymph glands. In the\r\nox they are also found under the trapezius muscle, under the skin of the\r\nupper part of the flank, and in other places less constantly.\r\n\r\nThe =tissue= or =lymph-spaces= are interstices of varying size between\r\ncells or in the meshes of connective tissue. They contain a fluid\r\nderived from the blood-plasma, which is usually called =lymph=. They are\r\ndrained by the veins and lymph vessels. The large serous sacs are often\r\nincluded in this category.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The exact relationship between the lymphatic capillaries and the\r\n  tissue spaces is still a matter of controversy. It is held by some\r\n  that the lymph vessels are in direct communication with the tissue\r\n  spaces, while others maintain that the lymphatics are complete closed\r\n  tubes. Communication between the spaces and vessels is in general very\r\n  free. Mall has shown that granules injected into the hepatic artery\r\n  are returned by the lymphatics as well as by the veins, and\r\n  intramuscular injections will enter the lymph vessels of the tendon in\r\n  spite of the absence of lymphatics in muscle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LYMPHATIC SYSTEM OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE THORACIC DUCT (Figs. 428, 429)\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic duct= (Ductus thoracicus) is the chief collecting trunk of\r\nthe lymphatic system. It begins as an elongated irregular dilatation,\r\nthe =cisterna= or =receptaculum chyli=, which is situated between the\r\nright side of the aorta and the right crus of the diaphragm at the first\r\nand second lumbar vertebræ. The duct enters the thorax through the\r\nhiatus aorticus and runs forward on the right of the median plane\r\nbetween the vena azygos and the aorta, covered by the pleura. At the\r\nsixth or seventh thoracic vertebra it inclines somewhat ventrally,\r\ncrosses obliquely over the left face of the œsophagus, and passes\r\nforward on the left side of the trachea to the inlet of the thorax. The\r\nextrathoracic terminal part passes downward and forward a variable\r\ndistance (3 to 4 cm.) on the deep face of the left scalenus muscle,\r\nbends inward and backward under the bicarotid trunk, and opens into the\r\nupper part of the origin of the anterior vena cava just behind the angle\r\nof junction of the jugular veins. The terminal bend is ampullate and\r\nsometimes divides into two very short branches which open close\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Since the duct develops from a plexus of ducts in the embryo,\r\n  considerable variation from the more usual course occurs. There is\r\n  often a left duct which arises at the cisterna or at a variable point\r\n  from the right duct, runs across the left intercostal arteries\r\n  parallel to the latter, and unites with it over the base of the heart\r\n  or further forward. The two are connected by cross-branches. In some\r\n  cases the left duct is the larger, and there may indeed be none on the\r\n  right side. Other variations are common.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief tributaries of the thoracic duct are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The two =lumbar trunks= (Trunci lumbales) are formed by the\r\nconfluence of the efferent ducts of the lumbar glands, and commonly\r\nunite with each other and with the posterior intestinal trunk before\r\nopening into the cistern.\r\n\r\n2. The =intestinal trunks= (Trunci intestinales), two or three in\r\nnumber, receive the efferents of the lymph glands of the intestine,\r\nstomach, liver, and spleen.[176]\r\n\r\nIn its course through the thorax the thoracic duct receives efferents\r\nfrom the intercostal, mediastinal, and bronchial glands. At the thoracic\r\ninlet it is joined by ducts from the prepectoral and right axillary\r\nglands, and by the left tracheal duct. The duct is provided with several\r\npairs of valves; the best developed are at its termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE RIGHT LYMPHATIC DUCT\r\n\r\nThis vessel (Ductus lymphaticus dexter)—when present—collects the lymph\r\nfrom the right side of the head, neck, and thorax, and from the right\r\nthoracic limb. It is most frequently absent, being represented by a\r\nnumber of short ducts which terminate in the thoracic duct, the right\r\njugulo-brachial junction, or the origin of the anterior vena cava. When\r\npresent in its typical form, it results from the confluence of efferent\r\nducts from the right axillary and prepectoral lymph glands with the\r\nright tracheal duct. It lies on the deep face of the scalenus muscle\r\nabove the terminal part of the right jugular vein. It is more or less\r\nampullate and usually opens into the anterior vena cava to the right of\r\nthe thoracic duct. It may be connected with the latter by considerable\r\nanastomoses and may join it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The duct is very variable in form and in regard to its afferents.\r\n  Often it is a very short, irregular, and bulbous trunk; in some cases\r\n  it is about an inch and a half (ca. 3 to 4 cm.) in length and receives\r\n  the tracheal duct at its terminal bend. The lymphatico-venous\r\n  connections here need further study.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE LYMPH GLANDS AND VESSELS OF THE HEAD AND NECK\r\n\r\n1. The =submaxillary lymph glands= (Lg. submaxillares) (Figs. 437, 462)\r\nare arranged in two elongated groups in the submaxillary space along\r\neach side of the omo-hyoid muscles. The two groups are in apposition in\r\nfront of the insertion of these muscles and diverge posteriorly in the\r\nform of a =V=, extending backward about four or five inches (ca. 10 to\r\n12 cm.). They are covered by the skin and a thin layer of fascia and\r\npanniculus, and are therefore palpable. Anteriorly they are firmly\r\nattached to the mylo-hyoidei, but otherwise they are rather movable in\r\nthe normal state. Each group is related externally to the external\r\nmaxillary artery and the anterior belly of the digastricus, below to the\r\nexternal maxillary vein, and above to the lingual and sublingual veins.\r\n\r\nThey receive =afferent vessels= from the lips, nostrils, nasal region,\r\ncheeks, the anterior part of the tongue, the jaws, the floor of the\r\nmouth, and the greater part of the hard palate and nasal cavity. The\r\n=efferent vessels= pass to the anterior cervical and pharyngeal glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The superficial lymph vessels of the face converge to twelve to\r\n  fifteen trunks which turn around the lower border of the jaw with the\r\n  facial vessels. Those of the lips form plexuses at the commissures.\r\n  The nasal mucous membrane is richly supplied with lymph vessels which\r\n  accompany the veins; posteriorly they communicate with the subdural\r\n  and subarachnoid spaces and send efferents to the pharyngeal and\r\n  anterior cervical glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The =pharyngeal lymph glands= (Figs. 436, 437, 569) may consist of\r\ntwo groups. One lies on the lateral surface of the pharynx along the\r\ncourse of the external carotid artery. These glands are related\r\nexternally to the stylo-maxillaris and digastricus and often to the\r\nsubmaxillary gland also, above to the guttural pouch. Other glands (Lg.\r\nretropharyngeales) are commonly found on the guttural pouch along the\r\ncourse of the internal carotid artery. They lie below the artery and are\r\ncovered by the aponeurosis of the mastoido-humeralis and the cervical\r\nend of the submaxillary gland.\r\n\r\nThey receive afferent vessels from the cranium, the posterior part of\r\nthe tongue, the soft palate, pharynx, guttural pouch, larynx, posterior\r\npart of the nasal cavity, and efferents from the submaxillary glands.\r\n\r\n3. The =anterior cervical lymph glands= (Lg. cervicales craniales) are\r\nsituated chiefly along the course of the common carotid artery in the\r\nvicinity of the thyroid gland, under cover of the cervical angle of the\r\nparotid gland. Some occur between the thyroid and the submaxillary\r\nsalivary gland, others above and partly upon the thyroid. They are\r\nrelated deeply to the posterior part of the larynx, the trachea, the\r\nthyroid gland, and the œsophagus; below to the external maxillary vein\r\nand the outer border of the omo-hyoideus.[177]\r\n\r\n\r\n  These glands are variable. Often there are none in front of the\r\n  thyroid and the group may extend back a considerable distance along\r\n  the course of the carotid artery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir afferents are deep lymph vessels from the head, the pharynx,\r\nlarynx, guttural pouch, and thyroid gland, and efferents from the\r\nsubmaxillary and pharyngeal glands. Their efferent vessels go to the\r\nmiddle and posterior cervical glands.\r\n\r\n4. The =middle cervical lymph glands= (Lg. cervicales mediæ) form an\r\ninconstant group situated a little in front of the middle of the neck on\r\nthe trachea below the carotid artery. The group is usually small and in\r\nsome cases is absent, being replaced by a number of glands occurring at\r\nintervals along the course of the carotid artery. In other subjects the\r\ngroup consists of several glands of considerable size. They are\r\nintercalated in the course of the tracheal lymph ducts.\r\n\r\n5. The =posterior cervical= or =prepectoral lymph glands= (Lg.\r\ncervicales caudales) form a large group below the trachea at the\r\nentrance to the thorax (Fig. 466). They occupy the interstices between\r\nthe vessels and muscles and extend forward a variable distance on the\r\nventral aspect of the trachea. They are covered by the panniculus and\r\nsterno-cephalicus. Their afferent vessels come from the head, neck,\r\nthorax, and thoracic limb. They receive efferent ducts of the anterior\r\nand middle cervical, prescapular, and axillary glands. Their efferents\r\ngo to the thoracic duct on the left, to the right lymphatic duct on the\r\nright, or open directly into the vena cava.\r\n\r\n6. The =prescapular= or =superficial cervical lymph glands= (Lg.\r\ncervicales superficiales) lie on the anterior border of the anterior\r\ndeep pectoral muscle, in relation to the omo-hyoideus internally and the\r\nmastoido-humeralis externally (Figs. 431, 441, 466). They are on the\r\ncourse of the ascending branch of the inferior cervical artery. They\r\nreceive afferents from the neck, breast, shoulder, and arm. Their\r\nefferents pass to the prepectoral glands.\r\n\r\nThe =tracheal ducts=, right and left (Ductus trachealis dexter,\r\nsinister), are collecting trunks for the lymph of the head and neck.\r\nThey lie on the trachea in relation to the carotid arteries. The right\r\none goes to the prepectoral glands or to the right lymphatic duct, the\r\nleft one to the terminal part of the thoracic duct.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE LYMPH GLANDS AND VESSELS OF THE THORAX\r\n\r\n1. The =intercostal lymph glands= (Lg. intercostales) are small and are\r\nsituated at the sides of the bodies of the thoracic vertebræ, in series\r\ncorresponding to the intercostal spaces. They receive afferents from the\r\nvertebral canal, the spinal muscles, the diaphragm, intercostal muscles,\r\nand pleura. The efferent vessels go to the thoracic duct.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the young subject these glands are more numerous than in the adult,\r\n  and there are also glands along the dorsal face of the thoracic aorta\r\n  which seem to disappear later.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The =anterior mediastinal lymph glands= (Lg. mediastinales craniales)\r\n(Fig. 428) are numerous. Some are situated on the course of the brachial\r\narteries and their branches; on the right side they are related deeply\r\nto the trachea, on the left to the œsophagus also. They are variable in\r\nsize and disposition and are continuous in front with the prepectoral\r\nglands. Other glands lie along the ventral face of the trachea on the\r\nanterior vena cava and the right atrium of the heart; these are\r\ncontinuous behind with the bronchial glands. A few glands usually occur\r\nalong the dorsal surface of the trachea, and there is often one at the\r\nangle of divergence of the brachiocephalic trunk. The afferent vessels\r\ncome chiefly from the pleura, the pericardium, the heart, the thymus or\r\nits remains, the trachea, and the œsophagus. Their efferent vessels pass\r\nto the prepectoral glands and the thoracic duct.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The glands along the ventral face of the trachea are frequently\r\n  enlarged and usually pigmented in dissecting-room subjects. The left\r\n  recurrent nerve lies above them on the ventral face of the trachea.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The =bronchial lymph glands= (Lg. bronchiales) are grouped around the\r\nterminal part of the trachea and the bronchi. One group lies on the\r\nupper surface of the bifurcation of the trachea and is continued a short\r\ndistance backward under the œsophagus (Fig. 428). Others lie below the\r\ntrachea and bronchi and also occupy the angle between the aortic arch\r\nand the pulmonary artery, concealing the left recurrent nerve and often\r\ncovering the vagus in this part of its course. Small glands occur along\r\nthe chief bronchi in the substance of the lungs (Lg. pulmonales). They\r\nreceive the deep and most of the superficial lymph vessels of the lungs,\r\nand the efferents from the posterior mediastinal glands. Their efferent\r\nvessels go to the thoracic duct and the anterior mediastinal glands. The\r\ndeep lymph vessels of the lung arise in plexuses which surround the\r\nterminal bronchi and accompany the bronchi to the root of the lung. The\r\nsuperficial vessels form a rich network under the pleura; most of them\r\npass to the bronchial glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The bronchial glands are commonly pigmented except in young subjects\r\n  and are often enlarged and indurated.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The =posterior mediastinal lymph glands= (Lg. mediastinales caudales)\r\nare usually small and are scattered along the posterior mediastinum\r\nabove the œsophagus. They receive afferent vessels from the œsophagus,\r\nmediastinum, diaphragm, and liver. The efferents go to the bronchial and\r\nanterior mediastinal lymph glands, partly to the thoracic duct directly.\r\n\r\nSometimes one or two small glands are situated in the acute angle\r\nbetween the posterior vena cava and the diaphragm.\r\n\r\n\r\n         THE LYMPH GLANDS AND VESSELS OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS\r\n\r\nThe =lymph glands of the abdomen= consist of two main groups, parietal\r\nand visceral. The =parietal glands= lie in the subperitoneal or\r\nsubcutaneous tissue; they receive the lymph vessels from the abdominal\r\nand pelvic walls, from parts of the viscera, and from the proximal lymph\r\nglands of the pelvic limbs. The =visceral glands= lie on the walls of\r\nthe viscera or in the peritoneal folds which connect the organs with the\r\nwall or with adjacent viscera. They receive all or most of the lymph\r\nvessels from the organs with which they are connected.\r\n\r\nThe =parietal glands= comprise the following:\r\n\r\n1. The =lumbar lymph glands= (Lg. lumbales) lie along the course of the\r\nabdominal aorta and posterior vena cava (Fig. 450). Some are placed\r\nalong the lower surface and sides of the vessels, others above. A few\r\nsmall glands may be found above the sublumbar muscles. The small nodes\r\nwhich are situated at the hilus of the kidneys are often termed the\r\nrenal lymph glands. They receive afferent vessels from the lumbar wall\r\nof the abdomen and the paired viscera (kidneys, adrenals, genital\r\norgans), also the inguinal vessels and the efferents of the iliac\r\nglands. Their efferents go to the thoracic duct, constituting the lumbar\r\ntrunks of origin of that vessel.\r\n\r\n2. The =internal iliac lymph glands= (Lg. iliacæ internæ) are grouped\r\nabout the terminal part of the aorta and the origins of the iliac\r\narteries (Fig. 450). Their afferent vessels come chiefly from the\r\npelvis, pelvic viscera, and tail, and they receive efferent vessels of\r\nthe external iliac and deep inguinal glands.\r\n\r\n3. The =external iliac lymph glands= (Lg. iliacæ externæ) form a group\r\non either side on the iliac fascia at the bifurcation of the circumflex\r\niliac artery (Fig. 450). Their afferent vessels come from the flank and\r\nabdominal floor, the outer surface of the thigh, and the precrural\r\nglands. The efferent vessels go to the lumbar and internal iliac glands.\r\n\r\n4. The =sacral lymph glands= (Lg. sacrales) are small nodes situated\r\nalong the borders of the sacrum and on its pelvic surface. They receive\r\nafferents from the roof of the pelvis and from the tail, and their\r\nefferent vessels pass to the internal iliac glands.\r\n\r\n5. The =superficial inguinal lymph glands= (Lg. inguinales\r\nsuperficiales) lie on the abdominal tunic in front of the external\r\ninguinal ring (Fig. 457). They form an elongated group along the course\r\nof the subcutaneous abdominal artery, on either side of the penis in the\r\nmale, above the mammary glands in the female; in the latter they are\r\noften termed =mammary=. Their afferents come from the inner surface of\r\nthe thigh, the abdominal floor, the sheath and scrotum in the male, and\r\nthe mammary glands in the female. The efferent vessels ascend through\r\nthe inguinal canal and go to the deep inguinal and lumbar glands.\r\n\r\n6. The =ischiatic lymph gland= (Lg. ischiadica) is a small node which\r\nmay be found at the lesser sciatic notch. It receives lymph from the\r\nadjacent parts and from the popliteal glands, and sends efferents to the\r\nsacral and internal iliac glands.\r\n\r\nThe =visceral glands= include the following:\r\n\r\n1. The =gastric lymph glands= (Lg. gastricæ) are situated along the\r\ncourse of the gastric arteries. Several occur along the attachment of\r\nthe gastro-phrenic ligament. A group lies at the lesser curvature a\r\nshort distance below the cardia. There is another small group on the\r\nvisceral surface where the posterior gastric artery divides into its\r\nprimary branches. Two or three small nodes are usually found on the\r\nventral aspect of the pylorus. Other small glands are scattered along\r\nthe course of the gastro-epiploic and short gastric arteries in the\r\ngreat and gastro-splenic omenta. The efferent vessels pass largely to\r\nthe cœliac radicle of the thoracic duct, but along the left part of the\r\ngreat curvature they go to the splenic glands.\r\n\r\n2. The =hepatic lymph glands= (Lg. hepaticæ) lie along the portal vein\r\nand hepatic artery and in the lesser omentum. Their efferent vessels go\r\nto the cœliac radicle of the cisterna chyli.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Many of the lymph vessels from the parietal surface of the liver pass\r\n  in the falciform and lateral ligaments to the diaphragm and anastomose\r\n  with its lymphatics. Some pass through the diaphragm with the vena\r\n  cava and go to the mediastinal glands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =pancreatic lymph vessels= follow the course of the blood-vessels\r\nwhich supply the gland; most of them go to the splenic and hepatic\r\nglands.\r\n\r\n3. The =splenic lymph glands= (Lg. lienales) lie along the course of the\r\nsplenic blood-vessels. Their afferent vessels come from the subscapular\r\nnetwork of the spleen, from the greater curvature of the stomach, and\r\nfrom the left part of the pancreas. The efferents pass to the cœliac\r\nradicle of the thoracic duct.\r\n\r\n4. The =mesenteric lymph glands= (Lg. mesentericæ) are situated in the\r\ngreat mesentery near its root. They are numerous and hence lie close\r\ntogether. They receive a very large number of afferent vessels (400 to\r\n500) from the small intestine. They have several considerable efferents\r\nwhich concur in the formation of the intestinal radicles of the cisterna\r\nchyli.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The lymph vessels of the intestine form three sets of capillary\r\n  plexuses, viz., in the subserosa, submucosa, and mucosa. The lymph\r\n  follicles, solitary and aggregate, lie in the zone of the plexus of\r\n  the mucosa. The collecting vessels arise from the subserous plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The =lymph glands of the cæcum= are numerous and are distributed\r\nalong the course of the cæcal blood-vessels. Their efferents enter into\r\nthe formation of an intestinal radicle of the cisterna chyli.\r\n\r\n6. The =lymph glands of the great colon= are extremely numerous and are\r\nplaced close together along the colic blood-vessels. Their efferent\r\nvessels are large and numerous. They converge to two large trunks which\r\nconcur with those of the cæcum and small intestine to form an intestinal\r\nradicle of the cisterna chyli.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The intestinal radicles of the cisterna chyli are formed by the\r\n  confluence of efferents from the intestinal lymph glands. The anterior\r\n  trunk lies on the left side of the anterior mesenteric artery, passes\r\n  between that vessel and the cœliac artery, turns sharply backward\r\n  across the right renal vessels and opens into the cisterna. It is\r\n  formed by the union of the cœliac trunk with efferents from the glands\r\n  of the small intestine, cæcum and colon. It is about four inches (ca.\r\n  10 cm.) in length and is ampullate. The posterior trunk receives\r\n  vessels from the small intestine and small colon. It usually opens\r\n  into a trunk formed by the union of the right and left lumbar ducts.\r\n  It is usually ampullate at its termination (Franck). The arrangement\r\n  of these collecting trunks is, however, very variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. The =lymph glands of the small colon= are situated in part on the\r\nwall of the bowel along the attachment of the mesentery, in part between\r\nthe layers of the latter along the course of the blood-vessels. The\r\nefferent vessels go to the lumbar glands and to the posterior intestinal\r\nradicle of the thoracic duct.\r\n\r\nThe =lymph vessels of the rectum= pass chiefly to the lumbar and\r\ninternal iliac glands.\r\n\r\n8. The =anal lymph glands= (Lg. anales) form a small group on either\r\nside of the sphincter ani externus (Figs. 451, 453). They receive\r\nafferents from the anus, perineum, and tail. Their efferents go to the\r\ninternal iliac glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE LYMPH GLANDS AND VESSELS OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\n1. The =axillary lymph glands= (Lg. axillares), some ten to twelve in\r\nnumber, are grouped on the inner face of the distal part of the teres\r\nmajor and the tendon of the latissimus dorsi at the angle of junction of\r\nthe external thoracic and subscapular veins with the brachial (Fig.\r\n466). Their efferents include most of the lymph vessels of the limb,\r\nwhich come directly or as efferents from the cubital glands. They\r\nreceive also lymph vessels from the thoracic wall. The efferents\r\naccompany the brachial blood-vessels and end in the prepectoral glands\r\nand the thoracic and right lymphatic ducts.\r\n\r\n2. The =cubital lymph glands= (Lg. cubitales), usually eight to ten in\r\nnumber, form a discoid oval group at the inner side of the distal part\r\nof the shaft of the humerus (Figs. 441, 446). They lie behind the biceps\r\nmuscle on the brachial vessels and median nerve and are covered by the\r\ndeep fascia and the posterior superficial pectoral muscle. They receive\r\nas afferents most of the vessels from the limb below this point. Their\r\nefferents pass chiefly to the axillary glands, but in part to the\r\nprescapular glands also.\r\n\r\nA number of superficial lymph vessels ascend with or near the\r\nsubcutaneous veins (cephalic and accessory cephalic) and join the\r\nprescapular and prepectoral glands. Superficial vessels from the\r\nchest-wall and shoulder run across the latter to the prescapular glands.\r\nThe superficial lymphatics of the pectoral region form a plexus which\r\ndrains into the prepectoral and prescapular glands by a number of\r\nvessels which accompany the cephalic vein. The deep lymph vessels of the\r\npectoral region run with the external thoracic vein to the axillary\r\nglands.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE LYMPH GLANDS AND VESSELS OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\n1. The =precrural= or =subiliac lymph glands= (Lg. subiliacæ) are\r\nsituated in the fold of the groin on the anterior border of the tensor\r\nfasciæ latæ, about midway between the point of the hip and the patella\r\n(Figs. 450, 451, 457). They lie on the course of the posterior branch of\r\nthe circumflex iliac artery, and number usually about a dozen. They\r\nreceive superficial lymph vessels from the hip, thigh, and flank. Their\r\nefferent vessels ascend with the posterior circumflex iliac vein, enter\r\nthe abdomen near the external angle of the ilium, and join the external\r\niliac lymph glands.\r\n\r\n2. The =deep inguinal lymph glands= (Lg. inguinales profundæ) form a\r\nlarge group situated in the upper part of the femoral canal between the\r\npectineus and sartorius muscles (Figs. 451, 457). They cover the femoral\r\nvessels and are related superficially to the inguinal ligament. They\r\nreceive nearly all of the lymph vessels of the limb below them. Their\r\nefferent vessels ascend to the internal iliac glands.\r\n\r\n3. The =popliteal lymph glands= (Lg. popliteæ), usually four to six in\r\nnumber, lie behind the origin of the gastrocnemius and between the\r\nbiceps femoris and semitendinosus at the division of the posterior\r\nfemoral artery into its primary branches (Fig. 455). They receive the\r\ndeep lymph vessels of the distal part of the limb. Their efferent\r\nvessels chiefly follow the course of the femoral vessels to the deep\r\ninguinal glands, but one or two ascend in company with a vein along the\r\ngreat sciatic nerve and may enter a gland at the lesser sciatic notch.\r\nFrom this a vessel accompanies the internal pudic vein and joins the\r\ninternal iliac glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Several superficial lymph vessels ascend with or near the internal\r\n  metatarsal and saphenous veins, enter the femoral canal, and end in\r\n  the deep inguinal glands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE FŒTAL CIRCULATION\r\n\r\nThe blood of the fœtus is oxygenated, receives nutrient matter, and\r\ngives off waste matter by close contiguity with the maternal blood in\r\nthe placenta. The chief differences in the blood-vascular system as\r\ncompared with that which obtains after birth are correlated with this\r\ninterchange.\r\n\r\nThe =umbilical arteries=, right and left, are large vessels which arise\r\nfrom the internal iliac arteries and pass downward and forward in the\r\numbilical folds of peritoneum on either side of the bladder to the\r\numbilicus. Here they are incorporated with the umbilical vein and the\r\nurachus in the umbilical cord, ramify in the allantois, and end as the\r\ncapillaries of the fœtal placenta. They conduct the impure blood to the\r\nplacenta. After birth these vessels retract with the bladder to the\r\npelvic cavity; their lumen becomes greatly reduced and the wall\r\nthickened so that they are cord-like and are termed the round ligaments\r\nof the bladder.\r\n\r\nThe =umbilical vein= receives the oxygenated blood from the placenta.\r\nIts radicles converge to form in the horse a single large trunk which\r\nseparates from the other constituents of the umbilical cord on entering\r\nthe abdomen and passes forward along the abdominal floor in the free\r\nborder of the falciform ligament of the liver. It enters the latter at\r\nthe umbilical fissure and joins the portal vein, so that the blood\r\nconveyed by it passes through the capillaries of the liver before\r\nentering the posterior vena cava.\r\n\r\nIn the ox and dog some of the blood in the umbilical vein is conveyed\r\ndirectly to the vena cava by the =ductus venosus= (Arantii). This vessel\r\nis given off within the liver from a venous sinus formed by the\r\nconfluence of the portal and umbilical veins and passes directly to the\r\nposterior vena cava.\r\n\r\nThe =foramen ovale= is an opening in the septum between the atria, by\r\nwhich the latter communicate with each other. It is guarded by a valve\r\n(Valvula foraminis ovalis) which prevents the blood from passing from\r\nthe left atrium to the right. After birth the foramen soon closes, but\r\nthis part of the septum remains membranous, and there is a deep =fossa\r\novalis= in the right atrium which indicates the position of the former\r\nopening. In some cases the foramen persists to a variable extent in the\r\nadult without apparent disturbance of the circulation.\r\n\r\nThe =pulmonary circulation= is very limited in the fœtus, and most of\r\nthe blood which enters the pulmonary artery passes through the =ductus\r\narteriosus= to the aorta. This vessel is larger than the divisions of\r\nthe pulmonary which go to the lungs and joins the left side of the\r\naortic arch. After birth the pulmonary circulation undergoes promptly an\r\nenormous increase and the ductus is rapidly transformed into a fibrous\r\ncord—the =ligamentum arteriosum=.\r\n\r\nThe only arterial blood in the fœtus is that carried by the umbilical\r\nvein. This blood is mixed in the liver with the venous blood of the\r\nportal vein, and after passing through the capillaries of the liver is\r\ncarried by the hepatic veins to the posterior vena cava. The latter\r\nreceives also the venous blood from the posterior part of the trunk and\r\nthe pelvic limbs. It is generally believed that the blood carried into\r\nthe right atrium by the posterior vena cava passes largely, if not\r\nentirely, through the foramen ovale into the left atrium, while the\r\nblood flowing into it through the anterior vena cava passes into the\r\nright ventricle. On this basis the blood received by the left atrium\r\nconsists chiefly of mixed blood from the posterior vena cava, since the\r\nsmall amount of blood conveyed by the pulmonary veins is venous. This\r\nmixed blood passes into the left ventricle and is forced into the\r\nsystemic arteries. The venous blood from the anterior part of the body\r\nand the thoracic limbs is conveyed by the anterior vena cava to the\r\nright atrium, passes into the right ventricle, and is forced into the\r\npulmonary artery. A small amount is carried to the lungs, but the bulk\r\nof it passes by the ductus arteriosus into the aorta behind the point of\r\norigin of the brachiocephalic trunk (anterior aorta), and is carried to\r\nthe posterior part of the body, a large part passing by the umbilical\r\narteries to the placenta.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM OF THE OX\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE PERICARDIUM AND HEART\r\n\r\nThe =pericardium= is attached by two fibrous bands (Ligamenta\r\nsternopericardiaca) to the sternum opposite the facets for the sixth\r\ncostal cartilages; these ligaments, right and left, are embedded in the\r\nmass of fat which separates the apex of the pericardium from the floor\r\nof the thorax.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 467.—HEART OF OX, LEFT VIEW.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =heart= of the adult ox has an average weight of about 5½ to 6\r\npounds (ca. 2.5 to 2.7 kg.), or about 0.4 to 0.5 per cent. of the\r\nbody-weight. Its length from base to apex is relatively longer than that\r\nof the horse and the base is smaller in both its diameters.\r\n\r\nA shallow =intermediate groove= (Sulcus intermedius) extends from the\r\ncoronary groove down the left side of the posterior border, but does not\r\nreach the apex. The amount of fat in and near the grooves is much\r\ngreater than in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe heart is situated more to the left of the median plane than in the\r\nhorse and is opposite to the third, fourth, and fifth ribs when it is\r\ncontracted. It has extensive contact with the lateral wall of the thorax\r\non the left side, but none on the right side, where a considerable\r\nthickness of lung covers the pericardium.[178]\r\n\r\nTwo bones, the =ossa cordis=, develop in the aortic fibrous ring. The\r\nright one is in apposition with the atrio-ventricular rings and is\r\nirregularly triangular in form. Its left face is concave and gives\r\nattachment to the right posterior cusp of the aortic valve. The right\r\nsurface is convex from before backward. The base is superior. The\r\nposterior border bears two projections separated by a notch. It is\r\nusually a little more than an inch (ca. 4 cm.) in length. The left bone\r\nis smaller and is inconstant. Its concave right border gives attachment\r\nto the left posterior cusp of the aortic valve. There is a large fleshy\r\nmoderator band in the right ventricle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ARTERIES[179]\r\n\r\nThe great arterial trunks in the thorax resemble those of the horse in\r\ngeneral disposition.\r\n\r\nThe =left coronary artery= is much larger than the right one; it gives\r\noff a branch which descends in the intermediate groove, and terminates\r\nby running downward in the right longitudinal groove. The =right\r\nartery=, after emerging from the interval between the right auricle and\r\nthe pulmonary artery, divides into branches which are distributed to the\r\nwall of the right ventricle.\r\n\r\nThe =brachiocephalic trunk= (anterior aorta) is usually four or five\r\ninches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) in length.\r\n\r\nThe =brachial arteries= give off in the thorax the following branches:\r\n\r\n1. A common trunk for the subcostal, dorsal, superior or deep cervical,\r\nand vertebral arteries.\r\n\r\n(1) The =subcostal artery= commonly arises separately, but may be given\r\noff as in the horse. It supplies the first three intercostal arteries.\r\n\r\n(2) The =dorsal artery= is relatively small. It usually ascends in front\r\nof the first costo-vertebral joint and is distributed as in the horse.\r\n\r\n(3) The =superior= or =deep cervical artery= may arise from a common\r\nstem (Truncus vertebro-cervicalis) with the vertebral, or may constitute\r\na branch of that artery. It passes up between the first thoracic and\r\nlast cervical vertebræ or between the sixth and seventh cervical and is\r\ndistributed as in the horse.\r\n\r\n(4) The =vertebral artery= passes along the neck as in the horse to the\r\nintervertebral foramen between the second and third cervical vertebræ,\r\ngives off a muscular branch, and enters the vertebral canal (Fig. 469).\r\nIt runs forward on the floor of the canal—connected with its fellow by\r\ntwo or three transverse anastomoses—and divides in the atlas into two\r\nbranches. The smaller internal division (cerebrospinal artery) passes\r\nforward to the floor of the cranium and concurs with the condyloid\r\nartery and branches of the internal maxillary in the formation of a\r\nlarge =rete mirabile=. The large external branch emerges through the\r\nintervertebral foramen of the atlas and ramifies in the muscles of the\r\nneck in that region, compensating for the smallness of the branches of\r\nthe occipital artery. It also sends a branch to the rete mirabile. The\r\ncollateral branches detached to the cervical muscles are large and\r\ncompensate for the small size of the deep cervical artery. The\r\ncollateral spinal branches of the vertebrals pass through the\r\nintervertebral foramina, divide into anterior and posterior branches,\r\nand form two longitudinal trunks which are connected by cross-branches\r\nso as to form irregular polygonal figures.\r\n\r\n2. The =internal thoracic artery=.\r\n\r\n3. The =inferior cervical artery= corresponds usually to the ascending\r\nbranch of that vessel in the horse.\r\n\r\n4. The =external thoracic artery= is large and usually gives off a\r\nbranch which is equivalent to the descending branch of the inferior\r\ncervical artery of the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE COMMON CAROTID ARTERY\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 468.—SCHEMA OF CHIEF ARTERIES OF HEAD OF COW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Common carotid artery; _2_, thyro-laryngeal; _3_, thyroid; _4_,\r\n    laryngeal; _5_, pharyngeal; _6_, occipital; _7_, condyloid; _8_,\r\n    middle meningeal; _9_, pharyngeal; _10_, external maxillary; _11_,\r\n    lingual; _12_, sublingual; _13_, superior labial; _14_, internal\r\n    maxillary; _15_, masseteric; _16_, inferior alveolar; _17_,\r\n    buccinator; _18_, great palatine; _19_, sphenopalatine; _20_,\r\n    posterior auricular; _21_, superficial temporal; _22_, posterior\r\n    meningeal; _23_, anterior auricular; _24_, artery to matrix of horn;\r\n    _25_, deep temporal; _26_, arteries to rete mirabile; _27_, frontal;\r\n    _28_, malar; _28′_, dorsal nasal continuation of malar; _29_,\r\n    infraorbital; _29′_, lateral nasal continuation of _29_.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =carotid arteries= usually arise from a common trunk about two\r\ninches (ca. 5 cm.) in length, but in exceptional cases are given off\r\nseparately from the brachiocephalic. Each pursues a course similar to\r\nthat of the horse and is accompanied by the small internal jugular vein,\r\nbut is separated from the external jugular vein by the omo-hyoid and\r\nsterno-mastoid muscles. It divides at the digastricus into occipital,\r\nexternal maxillary, and external carotid arteries. In addition to\r\ntracheal, œsophageal, and muscular branches, it gives off the thyroid\r\nand laryngeal arteries. The =thyroid artery= (A. thyreoidea cranialis)\r\nbends around the anterior end of the thyroid gland, in which it\r\nramifies. The accessory thyroid artery is usually absent. The =laryngeal\r\nartery= may arise with the thyroid.\r\n\r\n1. The =occipital artery= is relatively small. It gives off:\r\n\r\n(1) The =pharyngeal artery=, which, however, may arise from the external\r\ncarotid.\r\n\r\n(2) Several branches to the muscles (chiefly the flexors) and to the\r\natlanto-occipital joint.\r\n\r\n(3) The =condyloid artery= passes into the cranium through the anterior\r\nforamen in the condyloid fossa, and joins the vertebral in the formation\r\nof the rete mirabile about the pituitary gland. Before entering the\r\ncranium it gives off a branch to the pharyngeal lymph glands, and the\r\nmiddle meningeal artery; the latter passes through the foramen lacerum.\r\nAnother branch enters the temporal canal and gives twigs to the\r\ntemporalis muscle and the mucous membrane of the frontal sinus. A\r\nmuscular branch emerges from the intervertebral foramen of the atlas. A\r\ndiploic branch goes into the occipital condyle and squama, and emits\r\ntwigs to the occipital muscles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 469.—FLOOR OF CRANIUM AND ANTERIOR PART OF VERTEBRAL CANAL OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Vertebral artery; _2_, muscular branches of _1_; _3_, branches of\r\n    _1_ to the rete mirabile, _4_; _5_, branches of internal maxillary\r\n    artery to rete; _6_, branch of internal maxillary artery entering\r\n    cranium through foramen ovale; _7_, condyloid artery; _8_, emergent\r\n    artery from rete, distributed like internal carotid artery of horse;\r\n    _9_, _9′_, longitudinal vertebral sinuses; _a_, cribriform plate;\r\n    _b_, optic foramina; _c_, for. lacerum orbitale + rotundum; _d_,\r\n    foramen ovale; _e_, occipital condyle; _f_, _g_, _h_, first, second,\r\n    and third cervical vertebræ. (After Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n2. The =external maxillary artery= is smaller than that of the horse,\r\nbut pursues a similar course. The =lingual artery= is large, and often\r\narises separately from the common carotid; it gives off a branch to the\r\nsubmaxillary gland, and the =sublingual artery=. After turning around\r\nthe jaw the facial gives off the two =labial arteries=. The =superior\r\nlabial= is large; it usually gives off a branch which runs forward\r\nalmost parallel with the lateral nasal. The =angular artery= is absent\r\nor rudimentary, and the =lateral= and =dorsal nasal arteries= spring\r\nfrom branches of the internal maxillary.\r\n\r\n3. The =external carotid artery= passes upward between the\r\nstylo-hyoideus and the great cornu of the hyoid bone, turns forward\r\nacross the external face of the latter, and divides into superficial\r\ntemporal and internal maxillary arteries. It gives off the following\r\ncollateral branches:\r\n\r\n(1) Branches to the parotid and submaxillary glands.\r\n\r\n(2) The =pharyngeal artery=, which, however, often arises from the\r\noccipital.\r\n\r\n(3) The =posterior auricular=, which resembles that of the horse and\r\nsends a stylo-mastoid branch into the tympanum. It may arise from the\r\nsuperficial temporal.\r\n\r\n(4) The =masseteric artery= resembles that of the horse, but is smaller.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial temporal artery= is large and presents the following\r\nspecial features: (1) Its transverse facial branch passes into the\r\ncentral part of the masseter. (2) It gives off a branch which\r\ncorresponds to the posterior meningeal artery of the horse, enters the\r\ntemporal canal, and ramifies in the dura mater, giving off twigs to the\r\nexternal ear, the temporal muscle, and the frontal sinus. (3) It usually\r\ngives off the anterior auricular artery. (4) Branches are supplied to\r\nthe frontalis muscle and the eyelids, (5) A large branch passes around\r\nthe outer side of the base of the horn-core, supplies the matrix of the\r\nhorn, and anastomoses across the back of the frontal eminence with the\r\nartery of the opposite side.\r\n\r\nThe =internal maxillary artery= is less curved than in the horse and is\r\nentirely extraosseous, since the alar canal is absent. The principal\r\ndifferential features in its branching are as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The =ophthalmic artery= forms a rete mirabile within the periorbita.\r\nIts frontal branch enters the supraorbital canal and ramifies chiefly in\r\nthe frontal sinus.\r\n\r\n(2) Several branches take the place of the internal carotid artery. One\r\nof these enters the cranial cavity through the foramen ovale and several\r\nsmall ones pass through the foramen which represents the foramen\r\nrotundum and foramen lacerum orbitale of the horse. They concur with the\r\nvertebral and condyloid arteries in the formation of an extensive =rete\r\nmirabile= on the cranial floor around the sella turcica. From each side\r\nof the rete an artery arises which is distributed in general like the\r\ninternal carotid of the horse.\r\n\r\n(3) The =malar artery= is large; it arises by a common trunk with the\r\ninfraorbital and gives off the =dorsal nasal= and the =angular artery of\r\nthe eye=.\r\n\r\n(4) The =infraorbital artery= is large and emerges from the infraorbital\r\nforamen to form the =lateral nasal artery=.\r\n\r\n(5) The =palatine artery= is smaller than in the horse and usually\r\narises by a common trunk with the sphenopalatine. It passes through the\r\npalatine canal and along the palatine groove, enters the nasal cavity\r\nthrough the incisive fissure, and does not go to the upper lip. It forms\r\na rete mirabile about the naso-palatine canal and terminates in the\r\nmucous membrane of the anterior part of the nasal cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     ARTERIES OF THE THORACIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =brachial artery= pursues the same course in the arm as that of the\r\nhorse. At the elbow it becomes the median.[180] The chief differential\r\nfeatures in its branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =subscapular artery= is almost as large as the continuation of\r\nthe brachial. The =posterior circumflex artery= sends branches backward\r\nand downward into the triceps, taking the place in part of the deep\r\nbrachial artery. The =thoracico-dorsal artery= supplies branches to the\r\npectoral muscles and the triceps as well as the teres major and\r\nlatissimus dorsi; it may arise directly from the brachial.\r\n\r\n2. The =deep brachial artery= is small.\r\n\r\n3. The =superior collateral ulnar artery= is often double, and does not\r\nextend to the carpus.\r\n\r\nThe =median artery= (posterior radial artery) descends along the inner\r\npart of the posterior surface of the radius and divides near the middle\r\nof the forearm into the radial and ulnar arteries. It gives off at the\r\nupper third of the forearm the =common interosseous artery=, a large\r\nvessel which anastomoses with the deep brachial, passes through the\r\nproximal interosseous space, and descends (as the dorsal interosseous)\r\nin the groove between the radius and ulna, and concurs in the formation\r\nof the rete carpi dorsale. At the distal end of the forearm it sends a\r\nbranch through the distal interosseous space, which passes downward,\r\nassists in forming the rete carpi volare, and is continued in the\r\nmetacarpus as the external deep volar metacarpal artery. This is a small\r\nvessel which passes down under the outer border of the suspensory\r\nligament and assists in forming the deep volar arch near the fetlock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 470.—ARTERIES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF OX, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Interosseous artery; _b_, dorsal branch of radial artery; _c_,\r\n    rete carpi dorsale; _d_, dorsal metacarpal artery; _e_, dorsal\r\n    common digital artery; _f_, _f_, dorsal proper digital arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 471.—ARTERIES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF OX, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _g_, Ulnar artery; _h_, radial artery; _i_, volar branch of common\r\n    interosseous artery; _k_, _l_, _m_, deep volar metacarpal arteries;\r\n    _A.v._, volar arches; _n_, volar common digital artery; _o_, _o′_,\r\n    _p_, volar proper digital arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =radial artery= is smaller than the ulnar. It descends on the flexor\r\ncarpi internus, passes over the postero-internal surface of the carpus,\r\nand is continued as the internal deep volar metacarpal. At the distal\r\nend of the forearm and at the carpus it furnishes branches to the retia\r\ncarpi. Another branch (A. met. perforans proximalis) runs outward\r\nbetween the suspensory ligament and the large metacarpal bone, passes\r\nthrough the proximal foramen of the bone, and unites with the\r\ninterosseous artery; before passing through the foramen it detaches the\r\nmiddle deep volar metacarpal artery (A. met. volaris prof. III.), which\r\ndescends on the posterior face of the metacarpal bone, receives an\r\nanastomotic branch from the internal deep artery, and concurs in the\r\nformation of the deep volar arch above the fetlock.\r\n\r\nThe =ulnar artery=, the larger of the two divisions of the median,\r\ndescends under cover of the flexor carpi internus without giving off any\r\nlarge branches in the forearm. It passes through the carpal canal and\r\ncontinues along the inner side of the deep flexor tendon as the =volar\r\ncommon digital artery=. At the distal third of the metacarpus this\r\nvessel is joined by a branch from the internal deep volar metacarpal\r\nartery, forming the superficial volar arch. Near this another branch of\r\nthe common digital (or of the internal digital) passes around the outer\r\nborder of the flexor tendons to the posterior face of the metacarpal\r\nbone and concurs with the deep volar metacarpal arteries in the\r\nformation of the deep volar arch. A branch from the arch passes forward\r\nthrough the inferior foramen of the metacarpal bone and joins the dorsal\r\nmetacarpal artery which descends from the rete carpi dorsale in the\r\nanterior metacarpal groove.\r\n\r\nThe =volar common digital artery= (A. metacarpea volaris superficialis\r\nIII.) passes into the interdigital space and divides into two =volar\r\nproper digital arteries=, which descend along the interdigital surfaces\r\nof the chief digits and pass through the foramina at the upper part of\r\nthe interdigital surfaces of the third phalanges, enter the cavities in\r\nthese bones, and ramify in a manner similar to the corresponding vessels\r\nin the horse. The volar common digital detaches a branch (A.\r\ninterdigitalis perforans) which passes forward through the upper part of\r\nthe interdigital space and anastomoses with the dorsal metacarpal\r\nartery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The volar proper digital arteries (or the common digital) give off, in\r\n  addition to other collaterals, branches which correspond to the\r\n  arteries of the plantar cushion of the horse. These pass to the bulbs\r\n  of the claws and anastomose with each other and with the inner and\r\n  outer digital arteries, forming an arch from which numerous branches\r\n  are distributed to the matrix of the hoofs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal metacarpal artery= (A. met. dorsalis III.) is a small vessel\r\nwhich arises from the rete carpi dorsale, descends in the groove on the\r\nanterior face of the metacarpal bone, and is joined by the inferior\r\nperforating metacarpal artery from the deep volar arch to constitute the\r\ndorsal common digital artery. This vessel (A. digitalis communis\r\ndorsalis III.) divides into two =dorsal proper digital arteries=.\r\n\r\nThe =internal digital artery= (A. digiti III. medialis) is the\r\ncontinuation of the internal deep volar metacarpal artery. It descends\r\non the inner side of the inner digit and terminates at the bulb of the\r\nclaw by anastomosing with the corresponding volar proper digital artery.\r\nIt gives off a branch to the rudimentary digit and forms a transverse\r\nanastomosis behind the first phalanx with the volar common digital or\r\nits inner division.\r\n\r\nThe =external digital artery= (A. digiti IV. lateralis) arises from the\r\ndeep volar arch, passes down on the outer side of the external digit and\r\nis distributed like the inner one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BRANCHES OF THE THORACIC AORTA\r\n\r\nThe =bronchial= and =œsophageal= arteries often arise separately.\r\n\r\nTen pairs of =intercostal arteries= usually arise from the aorta. The\r\nother three come from the subcostal artery.\r\n\r\nThe two =phrenic arteries= are very variable in origin. They may come\r\nfrom the aorta, the cœliac, left ruminal, or an intercostal or lumbar\r\nartery.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BRANCHES OF THE ABDOMINAL AORTA\r\n\r\nThe =cœliac artery= is about four to five inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) in\r\nlength. It passes downward and curves forward between the rumen and\r\npancreas on the left and the right crus of the diaphragm and the\r\nposterior vena cava on the right. It gives off five chief branches.\r\n\r\n1. The =hepatic artery= arises from the convex side of the curve of the\r\ncœliac artery as it crosses the posterior vena cava. It passes downward,\r\nforward, and to the right above the portal vein to the portal fissure,\r\nand gives off the following branches:\r\n\r\n(1) Pancreatic branches.\r\n\r\n(2) Dorsal and ventral branches to the liver. The ventral branch is the\r\nlarger; it gives off the right gastric artery, which runs in the lesser\r\nomentum to supply the origin of the duodenum and the pylorus,\r\nanastomosing with the dorsal branch of the omaso-abomasal artery.\r\n\r\n(3) The cystic artery supplies the gall-bladder.\r\n\r\n(4) The gastro-duodenal artery divides into right gastro-epiploic and\r\npancreatico-duodenal branches. The right gastro-epiploic artery\r\nanastomoses with the left gastro-epiploic. The pancreatico-duodenal\r\nartery anastomoses with the first intestinal branch of the anterior\r\nmesenteric artery.\r\n\r\n2. The =right ruminal artery= (A. ruminalis dextra) is the largest\r\nbranch, and usually arises by a short common trunk with the splenic. It\r\nruns downward and backward on the right face of the dorsal sac of the\r\nrumen to the posterior transverse fissure, in which it turns around to\r\nthe left and anastomoses with branches of the left ruminal artery. It\r\ngives off a pancreatic branch, dorsal and ventral coronary arteries,\r\nbranches to the great omentum, and ramifies on both surfaces of the\r\nrumen.\r\n\r\n3. The =left ruminal artery= (A. ruminalis sinistra) runs downward on\r\nthe anterior part of the right face of the rumen, enters the anterior\r\nfurrow, in which it runs from right to left, and continues backward in\r\nthe left longitudinal groove, anastomosing with branches of the right\r\nartery. It supplies chiefly the left face of the rumen, but not its\r\nposterior part. It usually gives off near its origin the =reticular\r\nartery= (A. reticularis); this rather small vessel passes forward on the\r\ndorsal curvature of the rumen and turns downward in the rumino-reticular\r\ngroove, in the bottom of which it runs around ventrally to the right\r\nside. It gives off a branch which passes to the left of the cardia and\r\nalong the lesser curvature of the reticulum to the neck of the omasum.\r\nThe reticular branches anastomose with the omaso-abomasal and left\r\nruminal arteries.\r\n\r\n4. The =omaso-abomasal artery= (A. gastrica sinistra) appears as the\r\ncontinuation of the cœliac. It passes forward and downward to the\r\ngreater curvature of the omasum and divides after a course of four or\r\nfive inches into two branches. The =dorsal branch= curves sharply\r\nbackward on the dorsal surface of the omasum, continues along the lesser\r\ncurvature of the abomasum, and anastomoses with the hepatic artery. It\r\nsupplies branches to the omasum and to the lesser curvature and pyloric\r\npart of the abomasum. The =ventral branch= (A. gastroepiploica sinistra)\r\nruns forward and downward over the anterior extremity of the omasum,\r\npasses backward in the great omentum close to the ventral curvature of\r\nthe abomasum, and anastomoses with the right gastro-epiploic. A\r\nconsiderable branch from it curves around in front of the neck of the\r\nomasum to communicate with the reticular artery. Another branch runs\r\nback across the left side of the omaso-abomasal junction, and a third\r\ngoes to the lesser (ventral) curvature of the omasum.\r\n\r\n5. The =splenic artery= usually arises by a common trunk with the right\r\nruminal artery. It passes forward and to the left across the dorsal\r\ncurvature of the rumen and enters the hilus of the spleen.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior mesenteric artery= arises from the aorta just behind the\r\ncœliac, and has about the same caliber as the latter. It passes downward\r\nand a little to the right, and crosses the colon as it emerges from the\r\nspiral to run backward. After detaching twigs to the pancreas it gives\r\noff in succession the following branches:\r\n\r\n1. A branch (A. colica media) passes to the colon as it emerges from the\r\nspiral arrangement. This artery is comparable to the middle colic or\r\nartery of the small colon of the horse; it runs backward along the\r\nterminal part of the colon, which it supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 472.—GASTRIC ARTERIES OF OX, RIGHT VIEW (PARTLY SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cœliac artery; _2_, right ruminal; _3_, splenic; _4_, reticular;\r\n    _5_, left ruminal; _6_, omaso-abomasal; _7_, dorsal branch of _6_;\r\n    _8_, ventral branch of _6_ (= left gastro-epiploic); _A_, dorsal sac\r\n    of rumen; _B_, ventral sac of rumen; _C_, _C_, posterior blind sacs;\r\n    _D_, œsophagus; _E_, reticulum; _F_, omasum; _G_, abomasum; _H_,\r\n    duodenum; _I_, right longitudinal furrow of rumen.

The ileo-cæco-colic artery ramifies on the right face of the spiral\r\npart of the colon. It gives off the ileo-cæcal artery, which divides\r\ninto ileal and cæcal arteries.\r\n\r\n3. An artery (Ramus collateralis) runs in the mesentery in a curve along\r\nthe ventral border of the coils of the colon. (This vessel is absent in\r\nthe sheep.)\r\n\r\n4. An artery which constitutes the direct continuation of the anterior\r\nmesenteric pursues a course in the mesentery corresponding to the series\r\nof mesenteric lymph glands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 474.—PLAN OF BRANCHES OF ANTERIOR MESENTERIC ARTERY OF OX.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Anterior mesenteric artery; _2_, middle colic artery; _3_,\r\n    ileo-cæco-colic artery; _4_, ramus collateralis; _5_, continuation\r\n    of anterior mesenteric artery, giving off branches to small\r\n    intestine; _6_, cæcal artery; _7_, colic branch of posterior\r\n    mesenteric artery; _A_, termination of duodenum.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe two preceding vessels are essentially the arteries of the small\r\nintestine, which they supply with the exception of its initial and\r\nterminal parts. The first gives off no considerable branches in its\r\ncourse along the ventral border of the coils of the colon, but on\r\ncurving upward along the latter it anastomoses with the second artery\r\nand detaches numerous branches to the small intestine which form series\r\nof superposed anastomotic arches. It supplies, roughly speaking, about\r\none-third of the small intestine and terminates by joining the ileal\r\nartery. The second artery gives off numerous branches which also form\r\narches and supply about the first two-thirds of the small intestine,\r\nexclusive of the small part supplied by branches of the cœliac artery.\r\nBoth arteries give branches to the lymph glands.[181]\r\n\r\nThe =posterior mesenteric artery= arises from the aorta near its\r\ntermination. It is small and supplies branches to the terminal part of\r\nthe colon and to the rectum.\r\n\r\nThe =renal arteries= arise from the aorta close together. The right one\r\npasses outward and forward across the dorsal face of the posterior vena\r\ncava to the hilus of the kidney. The left one runs backward, but\r\nnecessarily varies in direction in conformity with the position of the\r\nkidney (_q. v._).\r\n\r\nThe =spermatic arteries= resemble those of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =utero-ovarian arteries= are small.\r\n\r\nThe five pairs of =lumbar arteries= derived from the aorta are\r\ndistributed much as in the horse. The sixth usually comes from the\r\ninternal iliac artery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 475.—PELVIC ARTERIES OF COW.\r\n\r\n  Part of the right wall of the uterus and vagina is removed and the\r\n    cervix uteri is shown in sagittal section. _a_, Aorta; _b_,\r\n    utero-ovarian artery; _b′_, ovarian, and _b″_, uterine branch of\r\n    _b_; _c_, external iliac artery; _d_, right internal iliac artery;\r\n    _e_, common trunk of umbilical artery (_e′_) and middle uterine\r\n    artery (_f_); _g_, ilio-lumbar artery; _h_, anterior gluteal\r\n    arteries; _i_, middle hæmorrhoidal artery; _k_, posterior uterine\r\n    artery; _l_, perineal artery; _m_, posterior gluteal artery; _n_,\r\n    obturator arteries; _o_, artery of clitoris; _p_, posterior\r\n    mesenteric artery; _r_, anterior hæmorrhoidal artery; _s_, middle\r\n    sacral artery; _1_, ovary; _2_, apparent body of uterus, really\r\n    apposed horns; _2′_, cornu; _3_, vagina; _4_, cervix uteri; _4′_,\r\n    vaginal part of uterus (os uteri); _5_, _5′_, broad ligaments, large\r\n    part of right one removed; _6_, urinary bladder; _7_, rectum; _8_,\r\n    sacrum; _9_, symphysis pelvis. (After Zieger.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =middle sacral artery= is a vessel about 5 mm. in diameter which\r\ncontinues the aorta. It arises from the dorsal face of the aorta at the\r\nangle of divergence of the internal iliacs, runs backward on the pelvic\r\nsurface of the sacrum a little to the left of the median line, and is\r\ncontinued as the middle coccygeal artery. It gives off small collateral\r\nbranches to the spinal cord and the muscles of the tail and the =lateral\r\ncoccygeal arteries=. The latter may have a common trunk of origin, and\r\neach divides into dorsal and ventral branches. The =middle coccygeal\r\nartery= runs through the ventral (hæmal) arches of the coccygeal\r\nvertebræ. The coccygeal arteries are connected at pretty regular\r\nintervals by segmental anastomoses.\r\n\r\nThe =internal iliac arteries= are much longer than in the horse. Each\r\npasses backward on the sacro-sciatic ligament and divides about the\r\nmiddle of the pelvic wall into posterior gluteal and internal pudic\r\nbranches. The chief differences in its distribution are: (1) A large\r\ntrunk gives origin to the umbilical and middle uterine arteries. The\r\n=umbilical artery= is usually largely obliterated and its terminal\r\nbranches receive their blood through anastomoses with the internal\r\npudic. It gives off near its origin two small vessels, the ureteral\r\nartery (A. ureterica) and the deferential artery (A. deferentialis),\r\nwhich accompany the ureter and the vas deferens respectively. The\r\n=middle uterine artery= (A. uterina media) is very large. It is\r\ndistributed chiefly to the cornu of the uterus, and compensates for the\r\nsmall size of the utero-ovarian artery. (2) The =ilio-lumbar= artery is\r\nrelatively small and is distributed chiefly to the sublumbar muscles. It\r\nis sometimes replaced by branches of the circumflex iliac and gluteal\r\narteries. (3) The =anterior gluteal artery= is commonly represented by\r\nseveral vessels. (4) The =obturator artery= is represented by several\r\nsmall branches which supply the obturator and adductor muscles. (5) The\r\n=iliaco-femoral= and =lateral sacral arteries= are absent. The absence\r\nof the latter is compensated by the middle sacral and gluteal arteries.\r\n(6) The =posterior gluteal= (or ischiatic) artery is large. It emerges\r\nthrough the lesser sciatic notch and ramifies in the biceps femoris and\r\nadjacent muscles. (7) The =internal pudic artery= (A. urethro-genitalis)\r\nis the direct continuation of the internal iliac. It gives off branches\r\nto the rectum, bladder, urethra, and genital organs. In the male it\r\nsupplies the accessory genital glands and divides into dorsal and deep\r\narteries of the penis; the a. dorsalis penis runs along the dorsum penis\r\nto the glans and gives twigs to the prepuce; the a. profunda penis gives\r\noff a perineal branch and enters the corpus cavernosum penis. In the\r\nfemale it gives off a large posterior uterine artery, which supplies the\r\nposterior part of the uterus and gives branches to the vagina and\r\nbladder. It ends as the a. clitoridis, which supplies the clitoris and\r\nadjacent parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ARTERIES OF THE PELVIC LIMB\r\n\r\nThe =external iliac artery= has the same course as in the horse. The\r\ncircumflex iliac artery is large. A branch from it emerges between the\r\nabdominal and lumbar muscles near the external angle of the ilium and\r\nramifies like the terminals of the ilio-lumbar artery of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =femoral= and =popliteal arteries= pursue a similar course to those\r\nof the horse. The chief differences in their branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =external pudic artery= is distributed chiefly to the scrotum in\r\nthe male. In the cow it is usually termed the =mammary= and is very\r\nlarge, especially during lactation. Each divides at the base of the\r\nmammary gland into two branches which are distributed to the anterior\r\nand posterior parts (“quarters”) of the gland. A small branch\r\naccompanies the subcutaneous abdominal vein to the xiphoid region.\r\n\r\n2. The =deep femoral artery= gives off an obturator branch which passes\r\nup through the obturator foramen to supply the obturator internus and\r\ncompensates otherwise for the absence of the obturator artery.\r\n\r\n3. The =anterior femoral artery= is large. It often gives off the\r\n=external circumflex artery= of the thigh, which perforates the proximal\r\nend of the quadriceps, gives branches to that muscle, the iliacus,\r\nglutei, and tensor fasciæ latæ.\r\n\r\n4. The =saphenous artery= is large. It descends in front of the\r\nhomonymous vein to the postero-internal surface of the hock, where it\r\ndivides into two plantar branches. The =internal plantar artery= (A.\r\nplantaris medialis) is the direct continuation of the saphenous. It\r\ndescends at first along the inner border of the superficial flexor\r\ntendon and is continued as the =internal superficial plantar metatarsal\r\nartery= along the inner side of the deep flexor tendon with the internal\r\nplantar nerve. It anastomoses at the proximal end of the metatarsus with\r\nthe perforating metatarsal artery, assisting in the formation of the\r\nproximal plantar arch. Near the fetlock it concurs with the perforating\r\nbranch of the dorsal metatarsal artery in the formation of the distal\r\nplantar arch. Below this it is continued as the =internal digital\r\nartery=. The =external plantar artery= (A. plantaris lateralis) is\r\nsmall. It descends along the outer border of the deep flexor tendon with\r\nthe external plantar nerve, concurs with the perforating tarsal and the\r\ninternal plantar arteries in the formation of the proximal plantar arch,\r\nand gives branches to the rete tarsi dorsale. Continuing downward along\r\nthe deep flexor tendon as the =external superficial plantar metatarsal\r\nartery=, it assists in forming the distal plantar arch and becomes the\r\n=external digital artery=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 476.—ARTERIES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF OX, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Anterior tibial artery; _b_, proximal perforating metatarsal\r\n    artery; _c_, dorsal metatarsal artery; _d_, dorsal common digital\r\n    artery; _e_, _e′_, dorsal proper digital arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 477.—ARTERIES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF OX, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _e_, Saphenous artery; _f_, _f′_, internal and external plantar\r\n    arteries; _g_, _g′_, internal and external superficial plantar\r\n    metatarsal arteries; _h_, deep plantar metatarsal artery; _i_, _j_,\r\n    internal and external plantar digital arteries; _k_, plantar common\r\n    digital artery; _l_, _l′_, internal and external plantar digital\r\n    arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =posterior tibial artery= is relatively small and is distributed\r\nchiefly to the muscles on the posterior surface of the tibia. Lower down\r\nit is replaced by the saphenous artery as described above.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior tibial artery= has the same course as in the horse. It is\r\ncontinued down the groove on the front of the metatarsal bone as the\r\n=dorsal metatarsal artery=. This is the chief artery of the region and\r\nis accompanied by two veins. It detaches the proximal perforating\r\nmetatarsal artery, which passes through the proximal foramen of the\r\nmetatarsal bone and concurs with the superficial plantar arteries in\r\nforming the proximal plantar arch. Near the distal end of the metatarsal\r\nbone it gives off the distal perforating metatarsal artery which passes\r\nback through the distal metatarsal foramen and assists in forming the\r\ndistal plantar arch. The two arches are connected by the small =deep\r\nplantar metatarsal artery= which lies in the groove on the posterior\r\nface of the large metatarsal bone.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal common digital artery= is the direct continuation of the\r\ndorsal metatarsal. It divides into two branches which unite in the\r\ninterdigital space with the corresponding branches of the plantar common\r\ndigital to form the proper digital arteries.\r\n\r\nThe =plantar common digital artery= descends from the distal plantar\r\narch, anastomoses in the interdigital space with the internal and\r\nexternal digitals, and divides into two branches which join those of the\r\ndorsal common digital artery as before mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a brief statement of the more common arrangement of the\r\nvessels in the distal part of the limb, but minor variations are very\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE VEINS[182]\r\n\r\nThe =vena hemiazygos= usually takes the place of the vena azygos. It\r\nlies along the left side of the aorta and the bodies of the thoracic\r\nvertebræ, turns down across the left face of the aorta and left\r\npulmonary artery, runs back over the left auricle and opens into the\r\ngreat coronary vein or the right atrium. It receives the intercostal\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nTwo =jugular veins= occur on either side. The =internal jugular vein=\r\n(V. jugularis interna) is a relatively small vessel which accompanies\r\nthe carotid artery. It arises by occipital, laryngeal, and thyroid\r\nradicles, receives tracheal, œsophageal, and muscular branches, and\r\njoins the external jugular near its termination. It is sometimes absent,\r\nbut in some cases it appears, on the other hand, to be large enough to\r\ninterfere with venesection practised on the external jugular. The\r\n=external jugular vein= (V. jugularis externa) is very large and\r\ncorresponds to the single jugular of the horse. It is separated from the\r\ncarotid artery in the greater part of its course by the\r\nsterno-cephalicus and omo-hyoideus muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior cerebral vein= usually does not unite with the occipital;\r\nthe latter is continued by the internal jugular vein.\r\n\r\nThe =orbital veins= form a network between the periorbita and the\r\nmuscles of the eyeball. This plexus communicates with the cavernous\r\nsinus and with the superior cerebral vein. It is also drained by the\r\n=frontal vein= which runs in the supraorbital canal and groove and joins\r\nthe angular vein of the eye.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal nasal vein= is usually double.\r\n\r\nThe =superior labial vein= usually joins the infraorbital.\r\n\r\nThe =vena reflexa= is absent and the radicles which are received by it\r\nin the horse go to the internal maxillary vein.\r\n\r\nThe =sublingual vein= is very large.\r\n\r\nThe =veins of the thoracic limb= differ chiefly in the distal part; the\r\nspecial features are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal digital veins= ascend on the front of the digits and are\r\nconnected with the other digital veins by transverse branches. They\r\nunite near the fetlock to form the =dorsal metacarpal vein=. This runs\r\nupward on the anterior face of the metacarpus and carpus, inclines to\r\nthe inner surface of the radius, and joins the accessory cephalic or the\r\ncephalic vein.\r\n\r\nThe =volar digital veins= are larger than the dorsal. They lie on the\r\ninterdigital surfaces of the digits and unite in the interdigital space\r\nto form a trunk which is a satellite of the volar common digital artery.\r\n\r\nThe =internal= and =external digital veins= lie in front of the\r\ncorresponding arteries. They are connected with the volar digital vein\r\nby a large branch which passes between the flexor tendons and the first\r\nphalanx. At the distal end of the metacarpus each inclines forward and\r\nanastomoses with the volar common digital vein to form the volar venous\r\narch. The inner vein is continued as the internal volar metacarpal vein\r\nalong the inner border of the suspensory ligament, and becomes a\r\nsatellite of the radial artery in the forearm, while the outer one is\r\ncontinued on the posterior face of the metacarpal bone by two irregular\r\nveins, the external and middle volar metacarpals. The latter anastomose\r\nfreely with each other and with the inner vein. They unite below the\r\ncarpus or join the volar common digital vein.\r\n\r\nThe =accessory cephalic vein= is the upward continuation of the dorsal\r\nmetacarpal vein and is much larger than in the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =posterior vena cava= is partially embedded in the medial border of\r\nthe liver. Its abdominal part has a thicker wall than in the horse. Its\r\naffluents correspond to the arteries of which they are satellites. The\r\n=renal veins= are large and thick-walled; they run obliquely forward and\r\njoin the vena cava at an acute angle. The left one is much the longer.\r\n\r\nTwo =middle sacral= veins usually accompany the artery.\r\n\r\nThe =veins of the mammary glands= deserve special notice. They converge\r\nto a venous circle at the base of the udder, which is drained chiefly by\r\ntwo pairs of veins. The =subcutaneous abdominal vein= (anterior mammary\r\nor “milk” vein) is very large in animals of the dairy breeds and its\r\ncourse along the ventral wall of the abdomen is easily followed. It is\r\nusually flexuous. It emerges at the anterior border of the udder about\r\ntwo or three inches (ca. 5 to 8 cm.) from the linea alba, runs forward\r\n(deviating a little outward), dips under the panniculus, passes through\r\na foramen in the abdominal wall about a handbreadth from the median\r\nplane, and joins the internal thoracic vein. The =external pudic vein=\r\n(middle mammary vein) is also of considerable size. It ascends in the\r\ninguinal canal as a satellite of the artery and joins the external iliac\r\nvein. The right and left veins are connected at the posterior border of\r\nthe base of the udder by a large transverse branch. From the latter\r\narises the =perineal vein= (posterior mammary vein), which runs medially\r\nupward and backward to the perineum, turns around the ischial arch, and\r\njoins the internal pudic vein. In the male these veins are relatively\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe deep veins of the thigh and leg resemble those of the horse, but\r\nthere is no recurrent tibial vein.\r\n\r\nThe =saphenous vein= is much smaller than in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =recurrent tarsal vein= (external saphenous) is large. It is the\r\nupward continuation of the external plantar metatarsal vein and\r\nanastomoses with the anterior tibial and saphenous veins. It arises on\r\nthe outer face of the hock, ascends at first in front of the tendo\r\nAchillis, then crosses the latter externally, passes up between the\r\nbiceps femoris and semitendinosus, and joins the posterior femoral vein.\r\n\r\nThere are three chief metatarsal veins. The great =dorsal metatarsal\r\nvein= arises at the distal part of the metatarsus by the union of the\r\ndorsal digital vein and a large branch from the venous arch above the\r\nsesamoids. It ascends superficially between the long and lateral\r\nextensor tendons and becomes the chief radicle of the anterior tibial\r\nvein. The =internal plantar metatarsal vein= arises from the venous arch\r\nabove the fetlock, ascends along the inner border of the suspensory\r\nligament, passes through the vascular canal of the metatarsus and\r\ncentro-tarsal (as the perforating tarsal) and joins the anterior tibial\r\nvein. The =external plantar metatarsal vein= is larger than the\r\npreceding. It passes superficially over the outer face of the hock and\r\nis continued by the recurrent tarsal vein.\r\n\r\nThe =digital veins= differ from those of the fore limb chiefly in that\r\nthe dorsal vein is large and the plantar absent or small.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =portal vein= is formed usually by the confluence of two radicles,\r\ngastric and mesenteric. It receives the right gastro-epiploic vein and\r\nveins of the pancreas. The gastric vein is the largest affluent. It is\r\nformed by the junction of three veins, the left of which receives the\r\nsplenic vein. The anterior mesenteric vein is also formed by the\r\nconfluence of three radicles; it usually receives the small posterior\r\nmesenteric vein. The portal tributaries are in general satellites of the\r\ncorresponding arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE LYMPH VESSELS AND GLANDS\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic duct= arises from a small cisterna chyli and is very\r\nvariable. It is exceptional to find a single trunk throughout, as is\r\noften the case in the horse. The duct is largely covered by fat and\r\nsmall lymph glands. There are often two ducts, one on either side of the\r\naorta, which may join at a variable point or terminate close together at\r\nthe junctions of the jugular and brachial veins. In other cases the duct\r\nis single for a variable distance, then bifurcates or divides into three\r\nor four branches, which are often connected by plexiform anastomoses.\r\n\r\nThe efferent vessels from the intestine converge to a large trunk which\r\naccompanies the anterior mesenteric artery and vein. It passes below the\r\npancreas and receives usually a large duct which is formed by efferent\r\nvessels from the stomach, liver, and spleen; this duct sometimes opens\r\ndirectly into the cisterna. The gastro-intestinal trunk receives the\r\ncollecting duct (truncus lumbalis) of the lumbar lymph vessels, forms a\r\nbend around the right renal vessels, and joins the cisterna.\r\n\r\nThe =lymph glands= in the ox are in general less numerous but larger\r\nthan those of the horse, and in some situations a single large gland\r\noccurs instead of a group of smaller ones, as found in the latter\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThe =submaxillary lymph glands= are usually two in number, right and\r\nleft; each is situated under the external maxillary vein between the\r\nsubmaxillary salivary gland and the sterno-cephalicus muscle. Usually\r\none or two hæmolymph glands are near it. There is generally a small\r\ngland on the deep face of the anterior part of the submaxillary salivary\r\ngland, and small nodes may be found further forward in the submaxillary\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nA large =subparotid lymph gland= lies on the postero-superior part of\r\nthe masseter muscle, partly under cover of the upper end of the parotid\r\ngland. Several hæmolymph glands lie on its deep face.\r\n\r\nThe =pharyngeal lymph glands= number two or three on each side. Of\r\nthese, two large =suprapharyngeal glands= (Lg. retropharyngeales) are\r\nsituated about an inch apart between the dorsal wall of the pharynx and\r\nthe ventral straight muscles (Figs. 281, 365). These are two to three\r\ninches long. Enlargement of them is likely to cause difficulty in\r\nswallowing and in respiration. Behind these are several hæmolymph\r\nglands. An =atlantal gland= is situated below the wing of the atlas on\r\nthe spinal accessory nerve. It is discoid, oval in outline, and may be\r\nan inch and a half or more in length. It is partly covered by the upper\r\nend of the submaxillary salivary gland.\r\n\r\nA smaller lymph gland (parapharyngeal) is usually found along the lower\r\nborder of the carotid artery (_i. e._, ventral to the atlantal gland) on\r\nthe lateral wall of the pharynx and under cover of the submaxillary\r\nsalivary gland or at its posterior border.\r\n\r\nTwo or three small =anterior cervical lymph glands= commonly lie along\r\nthe carotid artery a little further back.\r\n\r\nThe =middle cervical lymph glands= comprise a series of small nodes\r\nalong the dorsal face of the trachea.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the sheep and goat there is a lymph gland at the middle of the\r\n  neck, in the angle between the spinalis and complexus, covered by the\r\n  splenius. It receives vessels from the atlantal gland and sends\r\n  efferents to the prescapular gland.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =prescapular= or =superficial cervical lymph gland= is situated at\r\nthe anterior border of the supraspinatus under cover of the\r\nmastoido-humeralis and omo-transversarius. It is elongated and may be an\r\ninch or more in width and four or five inches long. Two occur in\r\nexceptional cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A chain of hæmolymph glands lies along the front of the shoulder,\r\n  covered above by the trapezius. Others are frequently found (in the\r\n  calf especially) on the surface of the omo-transversarius at the point\r\n  where it passes under the mastoido-humeralis (Forgeot).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 478.—SUPERFICIAL LYMPH GLANDS OF COW PROJECTED ON SURFACE OF\r\n    BODY.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Submaxillary; _2_, subparotid; _3_, atlantal; _4_,\r\n    parapharyngeal; _5_, anterior cervical; _6_, middle cervical; _7_,\r\n    prescapular; _8_, precrural. (With use of fig. in Ellenberger-Baum,\r\n    Anat. f. Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =posterior cervical= or =prepectoral lymph glands= number commonly\r\nthree or four on each side. One or two are placed on the brachial\r\nvessels, one below the brachial vein at the first rib, and one at the\r\njunction of the common trunk of the external and subcutaneous thoracic\r\nveins with the brachial.\r\n\r\nThe =intercostal lymph glands= are situated, as in the horse, at the\r\nupper parts of the intercostal spaces. Associated with them are\r\nhæmolymph glands.\r\n\r\nThe =sternal lymph glands= are situated along the course of the internal\r\nthoracic artery at the lower part of the intercostal spaces. The largest\r\nis close to the thoracic inlet. Several glands occur in the fat about\r\nthe apex of the pericardium.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Several =anterior mediastinal lymph glands= are placed along the\r\nœsophagus and the trachea.[183] Hæmolymph glands occur here also.\r\n\r\nUsually three large =bronchial lymph glands= are present (Fig. 289). One\r\nis situated at the origin of each chief bronchus and the third is under\r\nthe trachea at the origin of the special bronchus of the apical lobe of\r\nthe right lung. Another may lie between the aorta and the left branch of\r\nthe pulmonary artery. These glands are often pigmented. Other small\r\nnodes are situated on the bronchi within the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior mediastinal lymph glands= comprise two or three of large\r\nsize placed along the dorsal wall of the œsophagus. There may be a\r\nsingle gland about eight inches (ca. 20 cm.) long, the anterior half of\r\nwhich lies on the œsophagus (Fig. 289).[184] A small gland is situated\r\nin the acute angle formed by the posterior vena cava and the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nA single =axillary lymph gland= is situated on the distal part of the\r\nteres major on the course of the vein from the latissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\nThe =lumbar lymph glands= form an irregular series scattered along the\r\nabdominal aorta and posterior vena. A bean-shaped =renal lymph gland=\r\noccurs at the hilus of each kidney. Hæmolymph glands occur along the\r\ncourse of the aorta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 479.—INTESTINE OF OX, SPREAD OUT.\r\n\r\n  _Ca_, Cæcum; _C_, colon; _D_, duodenum; _H_, ileum; _J_, jejunum; _R_,\r\n    rectum; _m_, mesenteric lymph glands. (After Edelmann.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =internal iliac lymph glands= comprise a group of five or six at the\r\ntermination of the aorta and the origin of the vena cava. A discoid\r\ngland, two inches or more in diameter, occurs near the side of the\r\npelvic inlet at the angle of divergence of the circumflex iliac artery\r\nfrom the external iliac. A small gland is sometimes found at the origin\r\nof the prepubic artery.\r\n\r\nThe =external iliac lymph glands= number commonly two on either side,\r\nand are situated near the point of the hip in front of the anterior\r\nbranch of the circumflex iliac artery.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial inguinal lymph glands= are situated centrally below the\r\nprepubic tendon and in the narrow space between the origins of the\r\ngraciles. In the male there are usually two or three on either side of\r\nthe penis behind the sigmoid flexure. In the cow they are\r\n=supramammary=, _i. e._, are situated above the posterior margin of the\r\nbase of the udder; two large glands which are in apposition with each\r\nother medially are constant, and above these there are often two smaller\r\nglands.\r\n\r\nAn =ischiatic lymph gland=, which is discoid and usually about an inch\r\nin diameter, is situated on the lower part of the sacro-sciatic ligament\r\nnear the lesser sciatic notch under cover of the biceps femoris.\r\n\r\nAn =anal lymph gland= is situated on the retractor ani on either side.\r\n\r\nThe =gastric lymph glands= are numerous and comprise: (1) a chain along\r\nthe course of the right ruminal artery and two or three in the left\r\ngroove of the rumen; (2) several on the reticulum above and below the\r\njunction with the omasum; (3) a series along the course of the superior\r\nomasal vessels and the lesser curvature of the abomasum; (4) an\r\nextensive chain along the ventral face of the omasum and the great\r\ncurvature of the abomasum at the attachment of the great omentum.\r\n\r\nTwo or three large =hepatic= or =portal lymph glands= are found at the\r\nupper part of the portal fissure of the liver.\r\n\r\nNo lymph glands occur at the hilus of the spleen. The efferent vessels\r\nfrom the spleen appear to go to glands along the course of the cœliac\r\nartery.\r\n\r\nA large discoid =cœliac lymph gland= lies on the pancreas and the cœliac\r\nartery, covering the latter as it gives off its primary branches.\r\n\r\nThe =mesenteric lymph glands= are large and numerous. They form a chain\r\nin the lower part of the mesentery along the course of the great\r\nmesenteric artery. They are chiefly elongated and narrow, and some have\r\na length of six to eight inches (15 to 20 cm.) or more. Sometimes\r\nseveral unite and form a narrow band about two feet in length. A large\r\ngland occurs at the origin of the spiral part of the colon, a group is\r\nfound near the anterior mesenteric trunk, and others are scattered along\r\nthe coils of the colon, which are best seen on the right side. A chain\r\nof small lymph glands extends along the terminal part of the colon and\r\nthe dorsal face of the rectum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =precrural lymph gland= is situated on the aponeurosis of the\r\nexternal oblique at the anterior border of the tensor fasciæ latæ a\r\nshort distance above the stifle. It is elongated like the prescapular\r\ngland and may be six inches (ca. 15 cm.) long. Several subcutaneous\r\nhæmolymph glands occur in this vicinity; others are situated further\r\nforward on the flank not far from the last rib. There is usually a\r\nround, flattened lymph gland about an inch in diameter on the upper part\r\nof the quadriceps femoris under cover of the tensor fasciæ latæ, and one\r\nor more small ones occur on the surface of the latter muscle.\r\n\r\nNo =deep inguinal lymph glands= are present.\r\n\r\nA single =popliteal lymph gland= an inch or more in length is situated\r\nsomewhat lower down on the gastrocnemius than in the horse, behind the\r\ntibial and peroneal nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF THE PIG\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE HEART\r\n\r\nThe =pericardium= is attached to the sternum from a point opposite to\r\nthe third rib as far as the xiphoid cartilage, and also to the sternal\r\npart of the diaphragm.\r\n\r\nThe =heart= is small in proportion to the body-weight, especially in fat\r\nanimals. It is relatively short and wide. The apex is blunt and is\r\nmarked by a notch (Incisura apicis). Its long axis is more oblique, but\r\nit is less asymmetrical with regard to the median plane, than in the\r\nhorse or ox. The lower border of the left auricle (appendix) is marked\r\nby several notches and is situated at a lower level than the right one.\r\nThe right longitudinal groove is placed far back and there is no\r\nposterior sulcus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE ARTERIES\r\n\r\nThe =pulmonary vessels= present no remarkable features.\r\n\r\nThe =aorta= resembles that of the horse and ox in its course and\r\nrelations, but the arch is more strongly curved. There is no common\r\nbrachiocephalic trunk (anterior aorta).\r\n\r\nThe =brachiocephalic artery= arises first from the aortic arch and\r\npasses forward below the trachea to the first rib. Here it gives off the\r\n=common carotid arteries=, and is continued around the first rib as the\r\nright brachial.\r\n\r\nThe =superior cervical=, =vertebral=, and =dorsal arteries= usually\r\narise by a common trunk.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior cervical artery= is large; its ascending branch gives off\r\nthe =posterior thyroid artery= and =parotid branches=.\r\n\r\nThe =internal= and =external thoracic arteries= give branches to the\r\npectoral mammary glands; the external may be absent.\r\n\r\nThe =left brachial artery= arises from the aortic arch just above the\r\nbrachiocephalic. It curves forward and downward and turns around the\r\nanterior border of the first rib. Its superior cervical, vertebral, and\r\ndorsal branches usually arise separately.\r\n\r\nThe =carotid arteries= arise from the brachiocephalic close together or\r\nby a very short common trunk. They terminate in occipital and internal\r\nand external carotid divisions.\r\n\r\nThe =occipital artery= resembles that of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =internal carotid artery= usually arises by a common trunk with the\r\noccipital. After giving off a large meningeal branch it passes through\r\nthe foramen lacerum and forms with the opposite artery a rete mirabile\r\nwhich resembles that of the ox, but is smaller and is not connected with\r\nthe vertebral and condyloid arteries.\r\n\r\nThe =external carotid artery= has the same course and termination as in\r\nthe horse. Its branches present the following special features: (1) The\r\n=lingual artery= is relatively large and supplies the pharyngeal artery,\r\nthe sublingual, muscular branches, and branches to the soft palate,\r\nsubmaxillary gland, and larynx. (2) The =external maxillary artery= is\r\nsmall and is distributed chiefly to the submaxillary gland, the\r\npharyngeal lymph glands, the masseter and the panniculus. It does not\r\nextend upon the lateral surface of the face. (3) The =posterior\r\nauricular artery= is long and relatively large; it gives off the\r\nposterior meningeal.\r\n\r\nThe =internal maxillary artery= pursues a flexuous course between the\r\nramus of the mandible and the pterygoid muscles. Its branches offer the\r\nfollowing special features: (1) The =inferior alveolar= (or dental) is\r\nlarge; branches from it emerge through four or five mental foramina and\r\ntake the place of the inferior labial. (2) The =buccinator artery= is\r\nalso large and extends to the lips. (3) The =infraorbital artery=\r\nextends to the snout and replaces the superior labial largely and the\r\nlateral nasal in part. The malar branch compensates largely for the\r\nabsence of the lateral and dorsal nasal. (4) The =palatine artery= is\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\nThe =intercostal arteries= number fourteen to sixteen in either side; of\r\nthese ten to twelve arise from the aorta, usually by short common\r\ntrunks. Frequently an intercostal artery is given off from that of an\r\nadjacent space.\r\n\r\nThe =bronchial= and =œsophageal arteries= usually arise separately.\r\n\r\nThe =cœliac artery= is half an inch to an inch long. It supplies a\r\nbranch to the left crus of the diaphragm and divides into two primary\r\nbranches, gastro-hepatic and splenic. The =gastro-hepatic artery= is the\r\nlarger. It gives off pancreatic branches, the anterior gastric artery,\r\nbranches to the lesser curvature of the stomach, pyloric and\r\ngastro-duodenal arteries. The latter divides into pancreatico-duodenal\r\nand right gastro-epiploic. The anterior gastric usually supplies the\r\nœsophageal artery. The continuing trunk (A. hepatica propria) gives off\r\na cystic branch and divides in the portal fissure into four branches\r\nwhich supply the liver. The =splenic artery= gives off the posterior\r\ngastric (usually), branches to the stomach above the cardia, twigs to\r\nthe pancreas, short gastric arteries to the left part of the great\r\ncurvature, and splenic branches, and is continued as the left\r\ngastro-epiploic artery.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The posterior gastric may arise from the gastro-hepatic or in the\r\n  angle of divergence of the two primary divisions of the cœliac. The\r\n  œsophageal branch may come from the splenic.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 480.—ARTERIES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF PIG, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Terminal part of volar interosseous artery; _b_, dorsal\r\n    interosseous artery; _c_, rete carpi dorsale; _d_, dorsal metacarpal\r\n    arteries; _e_, dorsal common digital arteries; _f_, dorsal proper\r\n    digital arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 481.—ARTERIES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF PIG, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _g_, Ulnar artery; _h_, superficial branch of radial artery; _i_,\r\n    collateral ulnar artery; _j_, volar interosseous artery; _h_, deep\r\n    branch of radial artery; _k_, deep volar metacarpal arteries; _l_,\r\n    superficial volar metacarpal arteries; _m_, volar common digital\r\n    artery; _n_, volar proper digital arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =anterior mesenteric artery= is long like that of the ox. It gives\r\ntwigs to the pancreas, the ilio-cæcal and two colic arteries, and is\r\ncontinued in the mesentery as the artery of the small intestine. This\r\ngives off numerous branches which form a series of arches along the\r\nmesenteric lymph glands. From these is formed a rich network which gives\r\noff innumerable fine branches placed close together. The colic arteries\r\nenter the axis of the spiral coil of the colon and anastomose at its\r\napex. Their branches also form rich networks.\r\n\r\nA =phrenico-abdominal artery= arises on either side a little in front of\r\nthe renals. It divides into branches which go to the costal part of the\r\ndiaphragm and the abdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =renal= and =spermatic arteries= present no special characters.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior mesenteric artery= arises near the termination of the\r\naorta. It is small and is distributed like that of the ox.\r\n\r\nSix pairs of =lumbar arteries= arise from the aorta. The seventh comes\r\nfrom the middle sacral.\r\n\r\nThe terminal branches of the aorta resemble those of the ox.\r\n\r\nThe arteries of the shoulder, arm, and forearm resemble in general those\r\nof the ox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 482.—ARTERIES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF PIG, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Anterior tibial artery, continued on tarsus as the dorsalis\r\n    pedis; _b_, perforating tarsal artery; _c_, dorsal metatarsal\r\n    arteries; _d_, common digital arteries; _e_, proper digital\r\n    arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 483.—ARTERIES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF PIG, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _f_, Saphenous artery, continued as internal tarsal artery; _g_,\r\n    external tarsal artery; _h_, internal plantar artery; _h′_, external\r\n    plantar artery; _i_, perforating tarsal artery; _j_, deep plantar\r\n    metatarsal arteries; _k_, common digital artery; _l_, proper digital\r\n    arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe main facts as to the =metacarpal= and =digital arteries= are as\r\nfollows: The rete carpi dorsale is formed essentially by the terminals\r\nof the interosseous artery of the forearm. It gives rise to three\r\n=dorsal metacarpal arteries= which descend in the corresponding\r\ninterosseous spaces and unite with branches of the volar metacarpals to\r\nform three =common digital arteries=. Each of these divides into two\r\n=proper digital arteries=, which descend along the interdigital surfaces\r\nof the digits. On the volar surface are two =volar arches=, superficial\r\nand deep, from which three =superficial= and three =deep volar\r\nmetacarpal arteries= arise. The deep arteries unite near the distal end\r\nof the space between the principal metacarpal bones to form a stem which\r\nunites with the middle (third) superficial artery. The superficial\r\narteries unite to form an arch from which =proper digital arteries= are\r\ngiven off to the axial aspect of the small digits, and a common digital\r\nwhich supplies two =volar proper digital arteries= to each of the chief\r\ndigits.\r\n\r\nThe arteries of the hip, thigh, and leg are arranged much as in the ox.\r\nA few special features may be noted.\r\n\r\nThe =ilio-lumbar artery= gives off a branch to the quadriceps femoris.\r\nIt may also supply the posterior abdominal artery, which otherwise\r\narises from the deep femoral.\r\n\r\nThe =deep femoral artery= is given off above the level of the pubis. The\r\nposterior abdominal and external pudic arteries may arise from it by a\r\nshort common trunk or separately. The =external pudic= gives branches to\r\nthe prepuce but not to the penis. The =popliteal artery= gives off the\r\nperoneal.\r\n\r\nThe =femoral artery= gives off a short trunk which divides into anterior\r\nfemoral and external circumflex arteries, the latter being much the\r\nlarger.\r\n\r\nThe =saphenous artery= is large. It descends on the inner surface of the\r\nleg and hock and concurs with the perforating tarsal artery in forming\r\nthe proximal plantar arch.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior tibial artery= is small, being replaced distally by the\r\nsaphenous. It gives branches to the muscles on the posterior face of the\r\ntibia and supplies the nutrient artery of that bone.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior tibial artery= is continued as the dorsalis pedis on the\r\nflexion surface of the tarsus. This gives off the =perforating tarsal\r\nartery=, which passes back through the vascular canal of the tarsus and\r\nunites with the terminal branches of the saphenous to form the proximal\r\nplantar arch.\r\n\r\nThe =metatarsal= and =digital arteries= resemble in arrangement the\r\ncorresponding vessels of the fore limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE VEINS\r\n\r\nThe veins resemble in general those of the ox. Thus there is a\r\nhemiazygos vein and two jugular veins, the internal one being relatively\r\nlarger than in the ox. A few differential features may be noted.\r\n\r\nThe =buccinator vein= resembles that of the horse, and unites with the\r\n=vena reflexa= to form a short common trunk which joins the facial.\r\n\r\nThe =facial vein= resembles in general that of the horse. The =dorsal\r\nnasal vein= is large, receives the veins from the snout, runs backward\r\nin the groove of the nasal bone and joins the frontal vein; it is\r\nconnected with its fellow by a transverse branch, and anastomoses freely\r\nwith the malar and facial.\r\n\r\nThe veins of the distal parts of the limbs naturally present differences\r\nwhich are correlated with those of the arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE LYMPH VESSELS AND GLANDS\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic duct= often divides near its termination into two branches\r\nwhich unite to form an ampulla. The latter suddenly contracts and opens\r\ninto the terminal part of the left jugular vein.\r\n\r\nThe =submaxillary lymph glands= are situated in the space between the\r\nomo-hyoid and internal pterygoid muscles in relation to the lower part\r\nof the anterior border of the submaxillary salivary gland. There are\r\ncommonly two on each side, one large, the other small.\r\n\r\nThe =parotid lymph glands= (Fig. 309) are reddish-brown in color. There\r\nare usually four of considerable size on either side. One is situated at\r\nthe upper part of the posterior border of the masseter, partly covered\r\nby the parotid gland. Another large subparotid gland lies below the base\r\nof the ear. Ventral to this are two smaller glands, one above and one\r\nbelow the external jugular vein.\r\n\r\nThe =pharyngeal= (or retropharyngeal) =lymph glands= (Fig. 310) are\r\nsituated on the dorsal wall of the pharynx above the external carotid\r\nartery and below and behind the paramastoid process. There are usually\r\ntwo of considerable size on either side.\r\n\r\nThe =middle cervical lymph glands= form a group on the\r\nmastoido-humeralis on the course of the external jugular vein.\r\n\r\nThe =prescapular lymph glands= are situated at the anterior border of\r\nthe anterior deep pectoral muscle undercover of the trapezius and\r\nomo-transversarius.\r\n\r\nThe =prepectoral lymph glands= are reddish in color and usually three in\r\nnumber. The largest is placed centrally under the trachea; the others\r\nare situated on the brachial vessels as they turn around the first rib.\r\n\r\nThe =axillary lymph glands= are usually absent, but very small nodes may\r\nbe found near the insertion of the latissimus dorsi. Cubital glands are\r\nnot present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 484.—STOMACH AND PART OF INTESTINE OF PIG, SPREAD OUT.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Pyloric portion of stomach; _b_, duodenum; _c_, jejunum; _d_,\r\n    cæcum; _e_, _f_, colon; _g_, pancreas; _h_, epiploic foramen (of\r\n    Winslow); _i_, portal vein; _k_, hepatic lymph glands; _l_, gastric\r\n    lymph glands; _m_, œsophagus.

Those placed near the hilus of the kidney are often\r\ndesignated =renal=.\r\n\r\nThe =internal iliac lymph glands= are rounded and relatively large. They\r\ncomprise: (1) three or four glands situated on and between the origin of\r\nthe circumflex iliac and the external and internal iliac arteries; (2) a\r\ngland in the angle of divergence of the internal iliac arteries.\r\n\r\nThe =external iliac lymph glands= are small, two or three in number, and\r\nlie in front of the circumflex iliac vessels near the point of the hip.\r\n\r\nThe visceral lymph glands of the abdomen comprise:\r\n\r\n1. =Gastric lymph glands= on the lesser curvature of the stomach.\r\n\r\n2. Several small =hepatic lymph glands= along the portal vein.\r\n\r\n3. An elongated =splenic lymph gland= on the splenic vessels near the\r\ndorsal end of the spleen.\r\n\r\n4. A series of =mesenteric lymph glands= situated along the anastomotic\r\narches formed by the vessels of the small intestine.\r\n\r\n5. Several =cæcal lymph glands= situated along the first part of the\r\ncæcal vessels.\r\n\r\n6. Two series of =colic lymph glands= which accompany the arteries of\r\nthe spiral part of the colon, and are exposed by separating the coils of\r\nthe bowel. Small glands are placed in the colic mesentery and above the\r\nrectum.\r\n\r\n7. The =anal lymph glands= are situated on either side on the retractor\r\nani.\r\n\r\nA small =ischiatic lymph gland= is found on the sacro-sciatic ligament\r\nnear the lesser sciatic notch.\r\n\r\nThe =precrural lymph glands= are situated on the aponeurosis of the\r\nexternal oblique below the external angle of the ilium.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial inguinal lymph glands= are situated behind the external\r\ninguinal ring. No deep inguinal lymph glands are present.\r\n\r\nThe =popliteal lymph glands= are small normally and may escape notice.\r\n\r\nA few nodules occur in front of the distal part of the tendo Achillis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CIRCULATORY SYSTEM OF THE DOG\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE PERICARDIUM AND HEART\r\n\r\nThe =pericardium= is attached to the sternal part of the diaphragm by a\r\nfibrous band, and is connected with the sternum only by the mediastinal\r\npleura.\r\n\r\nThe =heart= is almost globular in form, the apex being much blunter than\r\nin the other animals, and marked by a notch. Its long axis is almost\r\nparallel with the sternum and the apex (covered by the pericardium) is\r\ndirected against the sternal part of the diaphragm. Its weight averages\r\nabout 0.8 to 1 per cent. of the body-weight.[185]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The base extends forward to a transverse plane through the lower ends\r\n  of the third pair of ribs. The apex lies opposite the sixth costal\r\n  cartilage in expiration. On the right side the pericardium is in\r\n  direct contact with the chest-wall over a narrow triangular area (base\r\n  anterior) from the fourth to the sixth intercostal space inclusive. On\r\n  the left side the area of contact is smaller and is at the fourth,\r\n  fifth, and sixth cartilages.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two coronary arteries may arise by a common trunk. Each divides into\r\ncircumflex and descending branches. The left artery is twice as large as\r\nthe right one.\r\n\r\nThe great coronary vein ascends in the left longitudinal groove to the\r\ncoronary groove, in which it winds around the posterior face of the\r\nheart to the right side and opens into the right atrium below the\r\nposterior vena cava. Near its termination it receives one or two veins\r\nwhich ascend along the right longitudinal furrow. Several small veins\r\nfrom the wall of the right ventricle open into the right atrium\r\nseparately or by a common trunk.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE ARTERIES\r\n\r\nThere is no common brachiocephalic trunk (anterior aorta). Two large\r\nvessels arise from the convexity of the aortic arch; these are the\r\n=brachiocephalic= and =left brachial arteries=. The =brachiocephalic=\r\ngives off the two =carotid arteries=, no common trunk being present. It\r\nfrequently also supplies the posterior thyroid artery. The intrathoracic\r\nbranches of the brachial arteries are as follows:\r\n\r\nA common trunk gives off the =dorsal=, =subcostal=, and =superior\r\ncervical arteries=. The dorsal artery passes out in front of the first\r\nrib, and the superior cervical through the first intercostal space. The\r\nlatter is relatively small.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 485.—ARTERIES OF THORACIC CAVITY AND PART OF NECK OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Aortic arch; _a′_, thoracic aorta; _b_, brachiocephalic artery;\r\n    _c_, left brachial artery; _d_, _d_, common carotid arteries; _e_,\r\n    vertebral artery; _f_, dorsal artery; _g_, deep or superior cervical\r\n    artery (usually given off from a common trunk with _f_); _h_,\r\n    extrathoracic part of _f_; _i_, subcostal artery; _k_, inferior\r\n    cervical artery; _l_, descending branch of _k_; _m_, ascending\r\n    branch of _k_; _n_, internal scapular; _o_, acromial; _p_,\r\n    superficial cervical; _q_, _s_, extrathoracic part of left brachial;\r\n    _r_, external thoracic; _t_, internal thoracic; _t′_, asternal;\r\n    _t″_, anterior abdominal; _u_, perforating branch of _t_; _v_,\r\n    anterior mediastinal (thymic); _w_, ventral intercostals; _x_,\r\n    bronchial; _y_, œsophageal; _y′_, dorsal intercostals; _z_,\r\n    descending branch of left coronary artery; _z′_, circumflex branch\r\n    of same; _1_, œsophagus; _2_, trachea; _2′_, bronchi; _3_, first rib\r\n    (sawn off); _4_, right ventricle; _5_, left ventricle; _5′_, left\r\n    auricle; _5″_, pulmonary artery (cut off); _6_, diaphragm; _7_, _8_,\r\n    _9_, last three cervical vertebræ; _10_, thymus. (After Ellenberger,\r\n    in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =vertebral artery= may arise either in front of or behind the trunk\r\nabove mentioned; in the latter case it crosses the inner face of the\r\ntrunk. It passes along the neck in typical fashion to the third cervical\r\nvertebra and divides into three branches. The largest of these supplies\r\nthe muscles in this region, compensating for the absence of branches of\r\nthe superior cervical artery. The second passes between the second and\r\nthird cervical vertebræ into the vertebral canal and unites with the\r\nopposite artery and a branch of the occipital artery to form the\r\nbasilar. The third branch is the small continuation of the parent trunk;\r\nit passes to the wing of the atlas and anastomoses with the occipital.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior cervical artery= gives off the superficial cervical which\r\nascends in front of the supraspinatus.\r\n\r\nThe =internal thoracic artery= is large and sends perforating branches\r\nto the pectoral mammary glands.\r\n\r\nThe =external thoracic artery= arises outside of the thorax and sends\r\nbranches to the mammary glands.\r\n\r\nThe =common carotid arteries=, left and right, arise in that order from\r\nthe brachiocephalic. In the neck the right one lies on the trachea, the\r\nleft on the œsophagus. Collateral branches are the posterior thyroid\r\n(which may, however, arise from the right or left brachial or the\r\ninferior cervical), pharyngeal, thyro-laryngeal muscular, tracheal, and\r\nglandular (to the submaxillary gland). Each carotid divides under the\r\nwing of the atlas into occipital and internal and external carotid\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 486.—SUPERFICIAL VESSELS OF HEAD OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Facial artery; _2_, inferior labial artery; _3_, artery of angle\r\n    of mouth; _4_, superior labial artery; _5_, lateral nasal artery;\r\n    _6_, dorsal nasal artery; _7_, superficial temporal artery; _8_,\r\n    transverse facial artery; _9_, anterior auricular artery; _10_,\r\n    zygomatico-orbital artery; _11_, satellite vein of _10_; _12_, ant.\r\n    auricular vein; _13_, superficial temporal vein; _14_, internal\r\n    maxillary vein; _15_, post. auricular vein; _16_, _17_, external\r\n    jugular vein; _18_, external maxillary vein; _19_, _23_, facial\r\n    vein; _20_, inf. labial vein; _21_, buccinator vein; _22_, vena\r\n    reflexa; _24_, superior labial vein; _25_, vena angularis oculi;\r\n    _26_, dorsal nasal vein; _a_, concha; _b_, parotid gland; _c_,\r\n    submaxillary gland; _d_, submaxillary lymph glands; _e_,\r\n    mylo-hyoideus; _f_, digastricus; _g_, masseter; _h_, zygomaticus;\r\n    _i_, scutularis; _k_, temporalis; _l_, orbicularis oculi; _m_,\r\n    zygomatic arch; _n_, retractor anguli oris; _o_, buccinator.\r\n    (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Hundes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =occipital artery= is small. It gives off =condyloid= and =posterior\r\nmeningeal= branches, passes up through the notch on the anterior margin\r\nof the wing of the atlas, and is distributed to the muscles of this\r\nregion. Its =cerebrospinal= branch passes through the intervertebral\r\nforamen, and unites in the vertebral canal with its fellow and a branch\r\nfrom the vertebral artery to form the basilar. A retrograde branch\r\nanastomoses with the vertebral as in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =internal carotid artery=, also small, passes to the foramen lacerum\r\nposterius, enters the carotid canal and forms a bend before entering the\r\ncranium through the carotid foramen. It forms a plexus which is\r\nconnected by branches with the middle meningeal and ophthalmic arteries.\r\nIt then perforates the dura mater and enters into the formation of the\r\narterial circle (of Willis).\r\n\r\nThe =external carotid artery= is the direct continuation of the common\r\ncarotid. It passes along the lateral wall of the pharynx, emerges from\r\nbeneath the digastricus, and divides into superficial temporal and\r\ninternal maxillary arteries. It gives off the large flexuous =lingual\r\nartery= which has a course similar to that of the horse. The =external\r\nmaxillary=, smaller than the lingual, passes along the upper border of\r\nthe digastricus, gives off the sublingual, gains the anterior border of\r\nthe masseter, and divides into superior and inferior labial and the\r\nangularis oris. The last-named vessel passes forward on the cheek\r\nbetween the labials to the angle of the mouth. The =sublingual artery=\r\npasses at first along the upper border of the digastricus and continues\r\nbetween the mylo-hyoideus and the ramus of the mandible. The =posterior\r\nauricular artery= arises at the anterior border of the digastricus,\r\ngives branches to the salivary glands and the adjacent muscles, and\r\nascends on the convex face of the concha. It divides into two branches\r\nwhich return along the borders of the external ear.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial temporal artery=, after giving off the =anterior\r\nauricular artery= and a small =transverse facial artery=, turns forward\r\nunder the temporal fascia toward the eye, and divides into upper and\r\nlower branches which supply the frontal region and the eyelids. It also\r\nsupplies branches to the parotid gland and the masseter and temporalis\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\nThe =internal maxillary artery= pursues a course similar to that of the\r\nhorse. The mental branches of the =inferior alveolar= (or dental)\r\n=artery= are of considerable size and are distributed in the lower lip\r\nand gums. Two or three =deep temporal arteries= are present. The\r\nanterior one may arise from the buccinator; it gives off the middle\r\nmeningeal, which sends a branch to the carotid plexus. The =ophthalmic\r\nartery= gives off a branch which enters the cranium through the foramen\r\nlacerum orbitale and connects with the internal carotid; this is termed\r\nthe internal ophthalmic and gives off the arteria centralis retinæ. The\r\nsuperficial branches of the =infraorbital artery= replace the dorsal and\r\nlateral nasal arteries, and compensate for the small size of the\r\nsuperior labial.\r\n\r\nThe =brachial artery= in its course in the arm presents no special\r\nfeatures. At the elbow it passes between the biceps and the pronator\r\nteres, descends (as the median) under the flexor carpi radialis about a\r\nthird of the way down the forearm, and divides into radial and ulnar\r\narteries. Among its collateral branches are: (1) The =subscapular\r\nartery=, which passes up between the subscapularis and teres major,\r\nturns around the posterior angle of the scapula and terminates in the\r\nsupraspinatus, deltoid, trapezius, and mastoido-humeralis. In about half\r\nthe cases it gives off the =anterior circumflex=, which often arises\r\nwith the =posterior circumflex=. Its other branches resemble those of\r\nthe horse. (2) The =anterior circumflex artery= (in about half the\r\ncases). (3) The =deep brachial= arises about a third of the way down the\r\narm. (4) The =bicipital artery= (for the biceps) is given off at the\r\nlower part of the arm. (5) The =proximal collateral radial artery= (not\r\npresent in the horse) arises at the lower fourth of the arm, crosses\r\nover the terminal part of the biceps, descends on the extensor carpi\r\nradialis, and concurs with a branch of the volar interosseous in forming\r\nthe rete carpi dorsale. It often supplies the bicipital artery. (6) The\r\n=anterior radial artery= (A. collateralis radialis distalis) is very\r\nsmall. (7) The =common interosseous artery= is given off a little below\r\nthe elbow. It supplies branches to the flexor muscles and the =dorsal\r\ninterosseous artery=, which passes through the interosseous space, gives\r\nbranches to the extensor muscles, and by its terminal twigs concurs in\r\nthe formation of the rete carpi dorsale. The direct continuation of the\r\ntrunk is the =volar interosseous artery=, which descends under cover of\r\nthe pronator quadratus, gives off a branch to the rete carpi dorsale and\r\nthe =fifth volar metacarpal artery=, and terminates by joining the volar\r\nbranch of the radial artery to form the deep volar arch. (8) The =volar\r\nantibrachial artery= (Ramus volaris antibrachii) arises below the\r\ninterosseous and descends at first under the flexor carpi radialis, then\r\nbetween the heads of the deep flexor, and divides into ascending and\r\ndescending branches.\r\n\r\nThe =radial artery=, the smaller terminal of the brachial, descends\r\nalong the inner border of the radius, and divides near the carpus into\r\ndorsal and volar branches. The =dorsal branch= assists in forming the\r\nrete carpi dorsale. The larger =volar branch= descends behind the inner\r\nborder of the carpus and joins the end of the volar interosseous in\r\nforming the =deep volar arch=. From this arch three =deep volar\r\nmetacarpal arteries= descend in the second, third, and fourth\r\nintermetacarpal spaces and concur with the corresponding superficial\r\nvolar and the dorsal arteries to form the common digitals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 487.—VESSELS AND NERVES OF INNER SURFACE OF SHOULDER AND ARM OF\r\n    DOG.\r\n\r\n  _a_, _b_, Brachial artery; _c_, subscapular vessels; _d_,\r\n    thoracico-dorsal vessels; _e_, deep brachial vessels; _f_, superior\r\n    collateral ulnar vessels; _g_, brachial vein; _h_, _h″_, cephalic\r\n    vein; _h′_, mediano-radial vein; _i_, anterior thoracic nerves; _k_,\r\n    musculo-cutaneous nerve; _l_, median nerve; _m_, ulnar nerve; _n_,\r\n    radial nerve; _o_, thoracico-dorsal nerve; _1_, subscapularis\r\n    muscle; _2_, supraspinatus muscle; _3_, teres major; _4_, latissimus\r\n    dorsi; _5_, deep pectoral muscle; _6_, biceps brachii; _7_, long\r\n    head of triceps; _8_, tensor fasciæ antibrachii; _9_, internal head\r\n    of triceps; _10_, pronator teres.

Near the middle of the\r\nmetacarpus it gives off the =first volar metacarpal artery= and divides\r\ninto the =second=, =third=, and =fourth superficial volar metacarpal\r\narteries=. The first volar artery unites with the corresponding dorsal\r\nartery to form the =first common digital artery=, which supplies proper\r\ndigital arteries for the opposed surfaces of the first and second\r\ndigits. The superficial volar arteries descend in the spaces between the\r\nother metacarpal bones, unite near the metacarpo-phalangeal joints with\r\nthe corresponding deep volar and dorsal metacarpal arteries to form\r\nthree =common digital arteries=. Each of the latter divides after a\r\nshort course into two =proper digital arteries=, which run along the\r\nopposed surfaces of the second to the fifth digits. The external digital\r\nartery of the fifth digit comes from the =superficial volar arch= formed\r\nby the union of a branch of the volar interosseous with the fourth\r\nsuperficial volar metacarpal artery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 489.—ARTERIES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF DOG, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Branch of volar interosseous artery; _b_, proximal collateral\r\n    radial artery (external branch); _c_, radial artery (dorsal branch);\r\n    _d_, rete carpi dorsale; _e_, deep dorsal metacarpal arteries; _f_,\r\n    superficial dorsal metacarpal arteries; _g_, common digital\r\n    arteries; _h_, proper digital arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 490.\r\n\r\n  _i_, Radial artery; _j_, ulnar artery; _k_, volar interosseous artery;\r\n    _l_, deep volar arch; _m_, external (fifth) volar metacarpal artery;\r\n    _n_, deep volar metacarpal arteries; _p_, superficial volar\r\n    metacarpal arteries; _o_, _q_, common digital arteries; _r_, proper\r\n    digital arteries.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe rete carpi dorsale gives off four =dorsal metacarpal arteries= which\r\ndescend in the intermetacarpal spaces and unite near the\r\nmetacarpo-phalangeal joints with the volar arteries to form the common\r\ndigitals.\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic aorta= supplies the last nine or ten pairs of intercostal\r\narteries, but no anterior phrenic arteries. It gives off two or more\r\nœsophageal branches, in addition to the broncho-œsophageal, which arises\r\nclose to or with the sixth intercostal and ramifies in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nThe =abdominal aorta=, after giving off the external iliac arteries,\r\ncontinues about half an inch to an inch (ca. 1 to 3 cm.) under the last\r\nlumbar vertebræ, gives off the internal iliacs, and is continued by the\r\nmiddle sacral artery. This small vessel runs backward under the sacrum\r\nand coccygeal vertebræ and gives off branches in segmental fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 491.—END BRANCHES OF AORTA AND RADICLES OF POSTERIOR VENA CAVA OF\r\n    DOG.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Abdominal aorta; _b_, posterior mesenteric artery; _c_, lumbar\r\n    arteries; _d_, circumflex iliac artery; _e_, external iliac artery;\r\n    _f_, deep femoral artery; _g_, posterior abdominal artery; _h_,\r\n    external pudic artery; _a_, femoral artery; _i_, _i_, internal iliac\r\n    arteries; _k_, visceral branch of _i_; l, parietal branch of _i_;\r\n    _m_, ilio-lumbar artery; _n_, anterior gluteal artery; _o_, lateral\r\n    coccygeal artery, _p_, posterior gluteal artery; _q_, umbilical\r\n    artery; _r_, middle hæmorrhoidal artery; β, posterior hæmorrhoidal\r\n    artery; _s_, perineal artery; _t_, art. profunda penis; _n_, art.\r\n    bulbi urethræ, _v_, art. dorsalis penis; _w_, middle sacral artery,\r\n    _a′_, posterior vena cava; other veins are satellites of arteries\r\n    and correspondingly named; _1_, ilio-psoas muscle; _2_, tendon of\r\n    psoas minor; _3_, abdominal muscles; _4_, sartorius; _5_, rectus\r\n    femoris; _5′_, vastus internus; _6_, pectineus; _6′_, adductor; _7_,\r\n    gracilis; _8_, symphysis pelvis; _9_, ilium; _10_, pyriformis; _11_,\r\n    gluteus superficialis; _12_, obturator internus; _13_, penis; _14_,\r\n    lumbar vertebræ. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =cœliac artery= gives off the hepatic artery and forms a short\r\n=gastro-splenic= trunk. The hepatic artery gives off several hepatic\r\nbranches, and the pyloric or right gastric artery, which passes along\r\nthe lesser curvature of the stomach, anastomoses with the (left)\r\n=gastric artery=, and is continued by the gastro-duodenal. This divides\r\nnear the pylorus into right gastro-epiploic and pancreatico-duodenal.\r\nThe (left) gastric artery passes to the lesser curvature of the stomach\r\nand ramifies chiefly on the left part of the stomach, giving off a\r\nbranch which anastomoses with the pyloric branch of the hepatic. The\r\n=splenic artery= gives off pancreatic branches, and reaches the lower\r\npart of the spleen. It gives off the left gastro-epiploic, and a branch\r\nwhich passes to the dorsal end of the spleen, which it supplies, besides\r\ngiving off twigs to the left extremity of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior mesenteric artery= arises close behind the cœliac. It\r\ngives off a common trunk for two colic arteries and the ileo-cæco-colic.\r\nThe former supply the transverse and the anterior part of the left or\r\ndescending colon, while the latter divides into branches for the ileum,\r\ncæcum, and first part of the colon. The trunk is continued as the artery\r\nof the small intestine, giving off fourteen to sixteen branches (Aa.\r\njejunales), which form a series of anastomotic arches in the mesentery\r\nnear the bowel.\r\n\r\nTwo =phrenico-abdominal arteries= (Aa. phrenicæ caudales) come off from\r\nthe aorta behind the anterior mesenteric, and divide into phrenic and\r\nabdominal branches. Each phrenic artery diverges from its fellow in\r\ndescending on the abdominal surface of the corresponding crus of the\r\ndiaphragm to the sternal part. The inner branches anastomose with those\r\nof the opposite artery, the outer branches with intercostal arteries\r\nchiefly. The abdominal arteries give branches to the lumbar muscles, the\r\nrenal fat and capsules, and ramify in the oblique abdominal muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =renal= and =spermatic arteries= offer no special features.\r\n\r\nThe =utero-ovarian artery= divides near the ovary into three or four\r\nbranches which supply the ovary and uterus, anastomosing with the\r\nuterine artery.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior mesenteric artery= is small. It divides into two branches\r\nwhich supply the terminal part of the colon and the anterior part of the\r\nrectum.\r\n\r\nThe =circumflex iliac artery= usually arises from the terminal part of\r\nthe aorta.\r\n\r\nThe =external iliac artery= usually gives off no collateral branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 492.—ARTERIES OF PELVIC LIMB OF DOG, INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Abdominal aorta; _b_, femoral; _c_, _c′_, deep femoral; _d_,\r\n    posterior abdominal; _e_, external pudic; _f_, internal circumflex;\r\n    _g_, anterior femoral (accompanied by anterior branch of femoral\r\n    nerve); _h_, external circumflex; _i_, _k_, muscular branches; _l_,\r\n    articular branch; _m_, saphenous; _n_, _o_, plantar and dorsal\r\n    branches of saphenous; _q_, saphenous nerve; _r_, obturator nerve;\r\n    _1_, ilio-psoas; _2_, ilium; _3_, gracilis; _4_, semitendinosus;\r\n    _5_, adductor magnus; _6_, adductor longus; _7_, quadriceps femoris;\r\n    _8_, sartorius; _9_, semimembranosus; _10_, gastrocnemius; _11_,\r\n    tibialis anterior; _12_, tibia.

The deep femoral gives off\r\nthe posterior abdominal and external pudic arteries by a very short\r\ncommon trunk or separately. In the female the external pudic divides\r\ninto anterior and posterior branches; the former runs forward, supplies\r\nbranches to the inguinal lymph glands, the mammary glands and skin, and\r\nanastomoses with the mammary branch of the internal thoracic artery; the\r\nposterior branch pursues a flexuous course between the thighs to the\r\nvulva, where its terminal branches anastomose with the internal pudic\r\nartery. The anterior femoral may arise by a short common trunk with the\r\nexternal circumflex. The former, accompanied by the anterior branch of\r\nthe femoral nerve, dips in between the rectus femoris and vastus\r\ninternus. The external circumflex artery passes forward between the\r\nsartorius internally and the rectus femoris and tensor fasciæ latæ\r\nexternally and supplies branches to these muscles and the glutei. In\r\naddition to muscular branches of considerable size, an articular branch\r\n(A. genu suprema) arises a little below the middle of the thigh and runs\r\ndownward and forward to the inner face of the stifle joint. The\r\n=saphenous artery= is large. It arises from the inner surface of the\r\nfemoral a little below the middle of the femur, descends superficially\r\nto the upper part of the leg and divides into two branches. The smaller\r\n=anterior branch= (Ramus dorsalis) passes obliquely downward and forward\r\nacross the inner surface of the tibia to the flexion surface of the hock\r\nand terminates in three =superficial dorsal metatarsal arteries=. The\r\n=posterior branch= (Ramus plantaris) passes down on the inner face of\r\nthe gastrocnemius and the long digital flexor. It gives off a branch (A.\r\ntarsea lateralis) which descends obliquely to the external surface of\r\nthe tarsus, and at the posterior face of the tarsus detaches the\r\n=internal= and =external plantar arteries=; these descend on either side\r\nof the deep flexor tendon and unite with the perforating metatarsal\r\nartery to form the proximal plantar arch. The artery continues down the\r\nmiddle of the plantar surface of the metatarsus and divides near the\r\nmetacarpo-phalangeal joints into three =superficial plantar metatarsal\r\narteries=. These vessels unite with three =deep plantar metatarsal\r\narteries= which descend from the proximal plantar arch and with branches\r\nfrom the dorsal metatarsal arteries. From these anastomoses four digital\r\narteries result; of these, the central two have a common digital trunk.\r\n\r\nThe =popliteal= and =posterior femoral arteries= present nothing of\r\nspecial interest.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior tibial artery= is small, being replaced largely by the\r\nsaphenous. It supplies twigs to the flexor muscles at the upper part of\r\nthe leg.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior tibial artery= descends on the anterior face of the tibia\r\nand tarsus and is continued as the perforating metatarsal artery, which\r\npasses through the upper part of the space between the second and third\r\nmetatarsal bones and concurs with the plantar branches of the saphenous\r\nin the formation of the plantar arch. Besides muscular and articular\r\nbranches, the anterior tibial supplies the external or fifth dorsal\r\nmetatarsal artery for the outer side of the fifth digit. At the proximal\r\npart of the metatarsus it gives off three =deep dorsal metatarsal\r\narteries= which descend in the intervals between the metatarsal bones\r\nand concur with the superficial dorsal and the plantar arteries in the\r\nformation of the =digital arteries=. The latter resemble in general\r\narrangement the corresponding arteries of the thoracic limb.\r\n\r\nThe =internal iliac artery= (Fig. 491) runs backward and a little\r\noutward across the ilio-psoas, and on reaching the ilium divides into\r\nparietal and visceral branches. The =parietal branch= is the larger. It\r\nruns backward on the lateral wall of the pelvis, passes out through the\r\nlesser sciatic notch, and breaks up into branches which supply the\r\nmuscles in this region like the posterior gluteal (or ischiatic) artery\r\nof the horse. It gives off the following branches: (1) The =ilio-lumbar\r\nartery= passes outward between the ilio-psoas and the shaft of the ilium\r\nand ramifies in the gluteus medius, giving branches to the ilio-psoas\r\nand tensor fasciæ latæ; it may arise from the internal iliac. (2) The\r\n=anterior gluteal artery= passes out behind the posterior superior spine\r\nof the ilium and supplies branches to the glutei. (3) =Muscular\r\nbranches= go to the obturator internus, coccygeus, and retractor ani.\r\n(4) The =lateral coccygeal artery= (A. caudalis lateralis superficialis)\r\npasses back at first on the outer face of the coccygeus and continues\r\nbeneath the skin along the side of the tail. The =visceral branch= or\r\n=internal pudic artery= passes back below the parietal branch on the\r\nlateral face of the rectum, retractor ani, and coccygeus. Its chief\r\ncollateral branches are: (1) The =umbilical artery=, which pursues a\r\nflexuous course and supplies twigs to the bladder, ureter, and vas\r\ndeferens. In the bitch it gives off a large =uterine artery= which\r\nramifies chiefly in the body and neck of the uterus and the vagina and\r\nanastomoses with the utero-ovarian. (2) The =middle hæmorrhoidal artery=\r\narises near the ischial arch, passes upward and forward on the lateral\r\nsurface of the rectum, gains its dorsal surface and anastomoses with the\r\nposterior mesenteric; it supplies the rectum and the anus, together with\r\nits muscles and glands. (3) A small =perineal artery= is detached to the\r\nperineum. In the male the trunk turns around the ischial arch as the\r\n=artery of the penis= (A. penis). This vessel, after giving off the\r\n=deep artery of the penis= (A. profunda penis), which supplies the\r\n=artery of the bulb= (A. bulbi urethræ) and enters the corpus\r\ncavernosum, is continued as the =dorsal artery of the penis= (A.\r\ndorsalis penis) along the dorsum penis. In the female the terminal\r\nbranches of the trunk go to the vulva, vestibular bulb, and clitoris.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE VEINS\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the veins is, of course, correlated in general with\r\nthe arterial system, but a few special features are worthy of mention.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior vena cava= is formed by the junction of short right and\r\n=left brachiocephalic= (or subclavian) =veins=, and each of the latter\r\nresults from the confluence of =jugular= and =brachial veins=.\r\n\r\nThe =vena azygos= resembles that of the horse, and receives at the ninth\r\nor tenth thoracic vertebra a =vena hemiazygos=.\r\n\r\nTwo =jugular veins= are present on each side. The =external jugular\r\nvein= is formed by the union of external and internal maxillary veins at\r\nthe posterior border of the submaxillary gland. The two external\r\njugulars are commonly united by a transverse branch below the cricoid\r\ncartilage. Each passes along the neck on the sterno-cephalicus, covered\r\nonly by the skin and panniculus, dips under the cleido-cervicalis, and\r\njoins the internal jugular.\r\n\r\nThe =external maxillary vein= arises on the lateral nasal region by the\r\njunction of the dorsal nasal vein with the angularis oculi. Near the\r\ninfraorbital foramen it receives the lateral nasal vein, and a little\r\nlower the superior labial. In its course along the anterior border of\r\nthe masseter it receives the vena reflexa, which arises in the\r\npterygo-palatine fossa by the junction of infraorbital, sphenopalatine,\r\nand palatine radicles, together with a branch from the cavernous sinus.\r\nAt the lower border of the mandible it is joined by the inferior labial\r\nvein, which receives the buccinator vein. The lingual vein is connected\r\nwith its fellow by a superficial transverse branch at the insertion of\r\nthe sterno-hyoidei. The sublingual and submental veins terminate in a\r\nvariable manner, but often form a common trunk which joins the lingual.\r\n\r\nThe =internal maxillary vein= arises from the pterygoid plexus, formed\r\nchiefly by dorsal lingual, inferior alveolar, deep temporal, pterygoid,\r\nand meningeal tributaries. It receives the superior cerebral, auricular,\r\nsuperficial temporal, transverse facial, and masseteric veins, and often\r\na trunk formed by the union of the inferior cerebral and occipital\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nThe =internal jugular vein= results usually from the junction of\r\nlaryngeal and thyroid veins, but in some cases it is formed by the\r\nconfluence of the inferior cerebral and occipital veins.\r\n\r\nThe =brachial= and =radial veins= are satellites of the arteries.\r\n\r\nThe =ulnar vein= is usually double. It unites below the carpus with a\r\nbranch of the interosseous vein to form the superficial venous arch.\r\n\r\nThe =cephalic vein= accompanies the ulnar artery in the forearm and\r\njoins the superficial venous arch below.\r\n\r\nThe =accessory cephalic vein= arises from the union of three dorsal\r\nmetatarsal veins. It joins the cephalic about the middle of the forearm.\r\n\r\nThere are three short =volar metacarpal veins= which open into the\r\nsuperficial venous arch. They are formed above the metacarpo-phalangeal\r\njoints by the junction of the =volar digital veins=, of which there are\r\ntwo for each of the chief digits. The volar vein of the first digit\r\njoins the superficial venous arch.\r\n\r\nEach of the chief digits has two =dorsal digital veins=, while the first\r\ndigit has one.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior vena cava=, its collateral affluents, and common iliac\r\nradicles present no special features of importance.\r\n\r\nThe =internal iliac vein= corresponds in regard to its tributaries with\r\nthe branches of the artery, except that it is not divided into dorsal\r\nand ventral branches.\r\n\r\nThe =external iliac=, =femoral=, and =popliteal veins= with their\r\ncollateral tributaries are satellites of the arteries.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior tibial vein= is usually double, and the =posterior tibial\r\nvein= is very small.\r\n\r\nThe =internal saphenous vein= is the upward continuation of the internal\r\nplantar metatarsal vein. It communicates by a large branch with the\r\ndorsal metatarsal vein, and ascends the leg as a satellite of the\r\nsaphenous artery and its plantar (posterior) branch. The =recurrent\r\ntarsal= or =external saphenous vein= is larger. It is formed at the\r\nlower part of the leg by the union of dorsal and external plantar\r\nmetatarsal veins, crosses the outer surface of the leg obliquely upward\r\nand backward, ascends behind the gastrocnemius and joins the posterior\r\nfemoral vein.\r\n\r\nThe =metatarsal= and =digital veins= resemble in general the\r\ncorresponding vessels of the fore limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE LYMPH VESSELS AND GLANDS\r\n\r\nThe =cisterna chyli= is large and fusiform. The =thoracic duct= may be\r\nsingle throughout, but often divides anteriorly into two branches, which\r\nmay then unite and form a dilatation which receives the left tracheal\r\nduct and the vessels from the fore limb. The primitive plexiform\r\narrangement persists in varying degree. The duct terminates in the left\r\nbrachiocephalic vein.\r\n\r\nThe =tracheal ducts= accompany the internal jugular veins. The right\r\nduct opens into the right brachiocephalic vein.\r\n\r\nThe =submaxillary lymph glands= (Fig. 486) are commonly three in number\r\non each side. They are situated in the angle between the masseter and\r\nthe submaxillary salivary gland, in relation to the external maxillary\r\nvein and covered only by the skin and panniculus. The number may be\r\nreduced to two or one with a corresponding increase in size.\r\n\r\nA small round =parotid= or =auricular lymph gland= is situated\r\nsuperficially between the upper part of the posterior border of the\r\nmasseter and the parotid gland.\r\n\r\nThe =pharyngeal= (or retropharyngeal) =lymph glands=, one or two in\r\nnumber on each side, lie on the pharynx chiefly under cover of the\r\nsubmaxillary salivary gland.\r\n\r\nThe =prescapular= or =superficial cervical lymph glands= lie on the\r\nserratus magnus at the anterior border of the supraspinatus, embedded in\r\na mass of fat. Usually two or three are present on each side, but there\r\nmay be only one. They are oval and are about an inch long in a dog of\r\nmedium size when two are present.\r\n\r\nThe =axillary lymph gland= lies in a mass of fat on the inner face of\r\nthe lower part of the teres major. It is discoid.\r\n\r\nThe =cubital lymph gland= is inconstant. It is situated on the deep face\r\nof the long head of the triceps or on the latissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\nThe =mediastinal lymph glands= are small and quite variable in\r\narrangement. Usually one or two glands are found on the course of the\r\ninternal thoracic vessels at the second segment of the sternum.\r\n\r\nThe =bronchial lymph glands= are commonly four in number. The largest is\r\nsituated in the angle of divergence of the chief bronchi, two lie on the\r\norigin of the right apical bronchus, and the fourth is between the\r\naortic arch and the anterior face of the left bronchus. They are\r\ncommonly pigmented.\r\n\r\nThe =lumbar lymph glands= are small.\r\n\r\nThe =mesenteric lymph glands= are represented chiefly by a long\r\nflattened mass (formerly known as the pancreas Aselli) which lies in the\r\nmesentery along the course of the anterior mesenteric artery and vein.\r\nIt is succeeded by three or four glands which lie along the portal vein\r\nand appear to receive vessels from the stomach, spleen, liver, pancreas,\r\nand great omentum. A few very small nodes occur along the colon.\r\n\r\nThe =iliac lymph glands= are relatively large and are situated at the\r\ntermination of the aorta and the origin of the iliac arteries. Commonly\r\nfour are present. Of these, the two largest lie on the psoas minor on\r\neach side in relation to the aorta and vena cava respectively. The other\r\ntwo are in the angle of divergence of the internal iliac arteries.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial inguinal lymph glands= are situated in the subcutaneous\r\nfat behind the external inguinal ring. They are relatively large,\r\nespecially when there is only one on each side; two smaller ones may be\r\nfound instead.\r\n\r\nThe =popliteal lymph gland=—usually unique, but sometimes double—lies in\r\na pad of fat on the upper part of the gastrocnemius between the biceps\r\nfemoris and semitendinosus. It may project back so as to be superficial\r\nand palpable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NEUROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\r\n\r\nThe nervous system is a complex mechanism by which the organism is\r\nbrought into functional relation with its environment, and its various\r\nparts are coördinated. For purposes of gross description it is divided\r\nprimarily into two parts, central and peripheral.\r\n\r\nThe =central nervous system= (Systema nervorum centrale) comprises (_a_)\r\nthe =spinal cord= (Medulla spinalis), and (_b_) the =brain=\r\n(Encephalon).\r\n\r\nThe =peripheral nervous system= (Systema nervorum periphericum) includes\r\n(_a_) the =cerebral= and =spinal nerves= with their =ganglia=, and (_b_)\r\nthe =sympathetic nervous system=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The division into central and peripheral parts is quite arbitrary and\r\n  is employed purely as a matter of convenience of description. The\r\n  fibers of which the nerves are composed either arise or end within the\r\n  central system, and therefore constitute an integral part of the\r\n  latter. The structural and functional unit of the nervous system is\r\n  the =neurone=, which consists of the =cell-body=, usually termed the\r\n  =nerve-cell=, and all its =processes=. The processes arise as\r\n  outgrowths from the cell-body and conduct impulses to or from the\r\n  cell. They vary greatly in length, some being less than a millimeter\r\n  long, while others extend from a cell in the spinal cord to the distal\r\n  end of a limb. A nerve is composed of such processes, usually inclosed\r\n  in a protecting and insulating sheath, and united into bundles by\r\n  connective tissue. The neurones are embedded in a peculiar supporting\r\n  tissue termed =neuroglia=. This consists of a very intricate feltwork\r\n  of glia-fibers, many of which are connected with the small glia-cells\r\n  or astrocytes. In addition the nervous tissue is invested closely by a\r\n  vascular layer of connective tissue, the pia mater, from which\r\n  ingrowths extend into the nervous substance proper.[186]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the naked eye the central nervous system appears to be composed\r\nchiefly of two kinds of substance, white and gray. The =white matter=\r\n(Substantia alba) is dead white in color and is soft in the natural\r\nstate. It consists largely of medullated nerve-fibers, packed closely\r\ntogether and arranged more or less clearly in large or small bundles or\r\ntracts (Funiculi, fasciculi). The =gray matter= (Substantia grisea) is\r\nusually brownish-gray in color, often with a tinge of pink. It is softer\r\nthan the white substance and much more vascular. It is composed chiefly\r\nof cell-bodies and non-medullated processes. In some situations it is\r\nmodified to form the =gelatinous substance= (Substantia gelatinosa),\r\nwhich is pale yellowish-gray and jelly-like.\r\n\r\n=Ganglia= are gray masses found on the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves\r\nand on the course of many nerves. They are commonly ovoid in form and\r\nare inclosed in a fibrous capsule. They are composed largely of the\r\ncell-bodies of neurones, but have connected with and passing through\r\nthem nerve-fibers (processes) which extend peripherally and centrally.\r\nIn origin and function the spinal ganglia belong properly to the central\r\nsystem, but it is customary to include them with the peripheral part in\r\ngross anatomical descriptions.\r\n\r\n=Nerves= are conducting trunks composed of bundles of parallel\r\nnerve-fibers. They are enveloped in a fibro-elastic sheath, the\r\nepineurium, which contains the blood and lymph vessels. They are\r\nclassified according to their central connections as =cranial= or\r\n=cerebral=, =spinal=, and =sympathetic=. The groups of cells of which\r\nthe nerve-fibers are processes are termed the =nuclei of origin or\r\ntermination= of the nerves, according as the latter conduct impulses in\r\na peripheral or central direction. On the same basis the nerve-fibers\r\nare designated =efferent= and =afferent= respectively. A bundle of\r\nfibers which passes from one nerve-trunk to another is called an\r\n=anastomotic branch= (Ramus anastomoticus). In some situations the\r\nexchange of branches between adjacent nerves is so free as to constitute\r\na =nerve-plexus= (Plexus nervorum). The term =ramus communicans= is\r\nproperly restricted to branches which connect the ventral divisions of\r\nthe spinal nerves with adjacent ganglia or nerves of the sympathetic\r\nsystem. The terminal twigs of the nerves are designated according to\r\ntheir distribution as =muscular branches= (Rami musculares), =cutaneous\r\nnerves= (Nervi cutanei), and =articular nerves= (Nervi articulares). The\r\nmuscular branches are motor in function, the cutaneous and articular\r\nsensory, but all contain vasomotor fibers which control the caliber of\r\nthe blood-vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE MENINGES\r\n\r\nThe central organs of the nervous system are inclosed in three meninges\r\nor membranes. From without inward these are: (1) the dura mater, (2) the\r\narachnoidea, and (3) the pia mater.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE DURA MATER\r\n\r\nThe =dura mater= is a dense resistant membrane of white fibrous tissue;\r\nin the fresh state it is bluish-white in color. On account of the\r\ndifference in its arrangement within the cranium from that in the spinal\r\ncanal it is customary to describe it as consisting of two parts,\r\ncerebral and spinal; these portions are continuous with each other at\r\nthe foramen magnum.\r\n\r\nThe =cerebral dura mater= (Dura mater encephali) is adherent to the\r\ninterior of the cranium, and may be regarded as forming an internal\r\nperiosteum for the bones here as well as being an envelope of the brain.\r\nIts outer surface is connected with the bony wall of the cranial cavity\r\nby numerous fine fibrous strands and by blood-vessels; hence it appears\r\nrough in many places when separated from the wall. The degree of\r\nadhesion varies greatly at different points. It is most firmly attached\r\nat the various projections, _e. g._, the internal sagittal crest, the\r\ntentorium osseum, the petrosal crest; also at the base and the foramen\r\nmagnum. Before the sutures are closed the dura is connected with the\r\nsutural ligaments and through them is continuous with the external\r\nperiosteum. The cranial nerves receive sheaths from the dura, which is\r\nthus continuous without the cranium with the epineurium and periosteum.\r\nAlong the roof and sides (except as noted above) the adhesion is\r\nrelatively slight, and lymph-spaces are said to exist between the dura\r\nand the bone. The internal surface of the dura is smooth and glistening,\r\nsince it is lined by endothelium and is moistened by a fluid resembling\r\nlymph; it forms the outer boundary of the subdural space. In accordance\r\nwith its double function the dura is composed of two layers, which are,\r\nhowever, intimately adherent to each other in most places in the adult.\r\nThe venous sinuses are channels between the two layers and are lined by\r\nendothelium. They have been described with the other vessels.\r\n\r\nSeveral folds or septa are given off from the inner surface of the dura;\r\nthese project into the cavity between the gross subdivisions of the\r\nbrain. These septa are: (1) the falx cerebri; (2) the tentorium\r\ncerebelli; and (3) the diaphragma sellæ.\r\n\r\nThe =falx cerebri= is a sickle-shaped median partition which projects\r\ndownward in the great longitudinal fissure between the cerebral\r\nhemispheres. It is attached above to the internal sagittal crest, in\r\nfront to the crista galli, and behind to the tentorium osseum. Its\r\nsuperior border is convex and separates into two layers which inclose\r\nthe superior longitudinal sinus. Its lower border is concave and lies\r\nover the corpus callosum. The falx is thick above, but much thinner\r\nbelow, and in some places cribriform.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the horse the posterior part of the falx cerebri does not extend to\r\n  the corpus callosum, and hence the hemispheres are here in contact and\r\n  adherent to each other over a small area. In the ox and pig the falx\r\n  does not descend so far as in the horse, while in the dog it\r\n  completely separates the hemispheres.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =tentorium cerebelli= is a crescentic transverse fold which\r\nseparates the cerebellum from the posterior poles of the cerebral\r\nhemispheres. It is attached above to the tentorium osseum and laterally\r\nto the petrosal crests. Its lower border is thin, concave, and free; it\r\nforms the upper and lateral boundaries of an opening (Incisura tentorii)\r\nwhich incloses the mid-brain.\r\n\r\nThe =diaphragma sellæ= is a small circular fold which roofs over the\r\nsella turcica and the pituitary body. It is perforated centrally by an\r\nopening (Foramen diaphragmatis) for the infundibulum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The falx cerebelli, a sickle-shaped fold which projects into the\r\n  median notch between the cerebellar hemispheres in man, is not present\r\n  in the domesticated animals. There is instead merely a slight\r\n  thickening of the dura.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =spinal dura mater= (Dura mater spinalis) forms a tube around the\r\nspinal cord from the foramen magnum to the second or third segment of\r\nthe sacrum. It is separated from the periosteum of the spinal canal by a\r\nconsiderable =epidural space= (Cavum epidurale) which is occupied by\r\nfatty connective tissue and veins. It is held in position chiefly by the\r\nsheaths which it furnishes to the roots of the spinal nerves, and in its\r\nanterior part by two ligaments; the latter connect it with the inferior\r\natlanto-occipital membrane and with the odontoid process. It is large in\r\nproportion to its contents, but its diameter is not uniform. It is\r\nlargest in the atlas, small in the thoracic region, and becomes very\r\nsmall in its terminal part, where it incloses the delicate filum\r\nterminale of the spinal cord.\r\n\r\nThe =subdural space= (Cavum subdurale) is the cavity between the inner\r\nsurface of the dura mater and the arachnoidea. It is a mere capillary\r\nspace which contains just sufficient fluid to moisten its surfaces; this\r\nfluid is usually regarded as lymph, which is replenished by filtration\r\nthrough the walls of the blood-vessels. The space is in communication\r\nwith the lymph-paths of the nerve-sheaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE ARACHNOIDEA\r\n\r\nThe =arachnoidea= is a very delicate and transparent membrane situated\r\nbetween the dura and pia mater. Its outer surface forms the inner wall\r\nof the subdural space and is covered by a layer of endothelium\r\ncontinuous with that of the opposed surface of the dura mater. Between\r\nit and the pia mater is the =subarachnoid space= (Cavum\r\nsubarachnoideale) which contains the cerebrospinal fluid. An inner\r\nsurface can scarcely be said to exist, since deeply the membrane becomes\r\na reticulum of fine fibers which traverse the subarachnoid space and are\r\nattached to the pia mater. The arachnoidea furnishes sheaths to the\r\ncerebral nerves from their superficial origins to a variable but usually\r\nshort distance beyond the emergence from the dursal sac. In the case of\r\nthe optic nerve this sheath extends to the eyeball.\r\n\r\nThe =arachnoidea of the brain= (Arachnoidea encephali), except in the\r\ncase of the great longitudinal and transverse fissures, does not dip\r\ninto the sulci on the surface of the brain. On the summits of the gyri\r\nit is so closely attached to the pia mater that the two form practically\r\na single membrane. Its outer part bridges over the sulci, and here the\r\nsubarachnoid space is partially divided up by the loose arachnoid tissue\r\ninto intercommunicating cavities. In certain situations the arachnoidea\r\nis separated from the pia by spaces of considerable depth and extent.\r\nThese enlargements of the subarachnoid space are termed =subarachnoid\r\ncisterns= (Cisternæ subarachnoidales). In them the subarachnoid tissue\r\ndoes not form a close network, but consists of a relatively small number\r\nof long, thread-like strands which traverse the cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The chief cisternæ are: (1) the cisterna magna, which is at the angle\r\n  formed between the posterior face of the cerebellum and the upper\r\n  surface of the medulla oblongata. It communicates with the fourth\r\n  ventricle through the foramen of Magendie (in man); and behind with\r\n  the wide subarachnoid space of the spinal cord; (2) the cisterna\r\n  pontis on the ventral surface of the pons; (3) the cisterna basalis,\r\n  which lies at the base of the cerebrum and is divided by the optic\r\n  chiasma into two parts (cisterna chiasmatis, cisterna\r\n  interpeduncularis); (4) the cisterna fossæ lateralis, situated at the\r\n  lower part of the lateral fissure (of Sylvius), and continuous with\r\n  the cisterna basalis.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong the upper border of the falx cerebri the arachnoidea bears bulbous\r\nexcrescences, the =arachnoid granulations= or =Pacchionian bodies=.\r\nThese are inclosed in thin evaginations of the dura mater and project\r\ninto the sagittal sinus or the parasinoidal sinuses along either side of\r\nit. In some cases they are sufficiently large to exert pressure on the\r\nbone and produce in it depressions of variable depth.\r\n\r\nThe =spinal arachnoidea= (Arachnoidea spinalis) is directly continuous\r\nwith that of the brain at the foramen magnum. It forms a relatively wide\r\ntube around the spinal cord, so that the latter (inclosed in the pia) is\r\nsurrounded by a very considerable quantity of cerebrospinal fluid. The\r\nspinal subarachnoid space is traversed by fewer arachnoid trabeculæ than\r\nis the case in the cranium. It is partially subdivided by three\r\nimperfect septa. One of these, the septum dorsale, is median and dorsal.\r\nThe other two, the ligamenta denticulata, are lateral and will be\r\ndescribed with the pia mater.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PIA MATER\r\n\r\nThe =pia mater= is a delicate and very vascular membrane which invests\r\nclosely the surface of the brain and spinal cord and sends processes\r\ninto their substance. It also furnishes sheaths to the nerves, which\r\nblend outside of the dural sac with the epineurium.\r\n\r\nThe =pia mater of the brain= (Pia mater encephali) follows accurately\r\nall the inequalities of the surface, dipping into all the fissures and\r\nsulci of the cerebrum, and into the larger fissures of the cerebellum.\r\nIts external surface, which forms the inner boundary of the subarachnoid\r\nspace, is covered by a layer of endothelium. From its deep face numerous\r\ntrabeculæ are given off which penetrate into the substance of the brain\r\nand cord, forming a path for the blood-vessels, and concurring with the\r\nneuroglia in forming the supporting tissue of the nervous substance\r\nproper. The larger blood-vessels of the brain lie within the\r\nsubarachnoid space, but the smaller vessels ramify in the pia, forming\r\nrich plexuses. The twigs which penetrate into the gray matter are\r\ninclosed in pial sheaths. They are end-arteries, _i. e._, constitute the\r\nentire supply of the district which they enter and do not anastomose\r\nwith adjacent vessels.\r\n\r\nTwo important folds of the pia extend into the two great transverse\r\nfissures of the brain; these processes overlie the third and fourth\r\nventricles and are known as the =telæ chorioideæ= of these cavities.\r\nThey constitute paths for the deeper vessels and their edges contain\r\nvascular convolutions which are known as chorioid plexuses. They will\r\nreceive further consideration more appropriately later.\r\n\r\nThe =spinal pia mater= (Pia mater spinalis) is thicker and denser than\r\nthat of the brain. It has a strong outer layer of fibrous tissue, most\r\nof the fibers of which are longitudinal. The inner layer is vascular and\r\nadheres closely to the surface of the cord because it sends numerous\r\nprocesses into it. It sends a fold into the median ventral fissure and\r\nalso helps to form the median dorsal septum of the cord. Along the\r\nmedian ventral line it forms a band-like thickening, the linea\r\nsplendens, along which the ventral spinal artery runs. On each side the\r\npia mater gives off a strong longitudinal band, the =ligamentum\r\ndenticulatum=, which is connected externally with the dura mater. The\r\ninner or pial border extends in a line between the dorsal and ventral\r\nroots of the nerves. The outer or dural border is denticulated and to a\r\nlarge extent free. The denticulations are attached to the dura between\r\nthe nerve-roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE SPINAL CORD\r\n\r\nThe =spinal cord= (Medulla spinalis) is the part of the central nervous\r\nsystem which is situated in the vertebral canal. It extends from the\r\nforamen magnum to about the middle of the sacrum.\r\n\r\nIn the horse its average length is about 76 to 78 inches (ca. 190 to 195\r\ncm.), and its weight about 8½ to 9 ounces (ca. 240 to 255 grams).\r\n\r\nIt is approximately cylindrical, but more or less flattened\r\ndorso-ventrally. There is no line of demarcation between it and the\r\nmedulla oblongata, but for practical purposes the division is usually\r\nassumed to be at the posterior border of the foramen magnum. Its\r\nposterior part tapers rapidly to a point, forming the =conus\r\nmedullaris=. This is prolonged for a short distance by the slender\r\n=filum terminale=.\r\n\r\nForty-two pairs of spinal nerves are connected with the sides of the\r\nspinal cord. They are classified as eight cervical, eighteen thoracic,\r\nsix lumbar, five sacral, and five coccygeal. According to the\r\nattachments of these series of nerves the spinal cord is divided into\r\n=cervical=, =thoracic=, =lumbar=, and =sacral= parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In a horse about 16½ hands high these parts measured 65 cm. (ca. 26\r\n  in.), 86 cm. (ca. 34.4 in.), 27 cm. (ca. 10.8 in.), and 15 cm. (ca. 6\r\n  in.) respectively (Dexler).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the embryo these divisions correspond primitively to the regions of\r\nthe vertebral column, but later, through unequal growth of the cord and\r\nspine, the correspondence between the two is not at all exact in the\r\nanterior regions and is lost in the last two. The lumbar part of the\r\ncord in the horse ends at the junction of the fifth and sixth lumbar\r\nvertebræ, so that the roots of the last lumbar nerve must run backward\r\nthe length of the last lumbar vertebra to reach the intervertebral\r\nforamen through which it emerges. The conus medullaris reaches only to\r\nthe anterior part of the sacral canal, so that the roots of the sacral\r\nand coccygeal nerves extend backward in the spinal canal for a\r\nconsiderable distance, forming a leash of bundles, in the center of\r\nwhich lie the conus medullaris and the filum terminale. This arrangement\r\nis expressively designated the =cauda equina=.\r\n\r\nEach pair of spinal nerves is attached by its root-fibers to a certain\r\nlength of the cord, and the latter is, therefore, regarded as consisting\r\nof as many =segments= as there are nerves. It is to be noted, however,\r\nthat there is no line of demarcation between the segments other than the\r\nintervals between the root-fibers of adjacent nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The segments are of different lengths; the longest are the third to\r\n  the sixth cervical, which measure 11, 10, 10, and 8.5 cm.\r\n  respectively. The spinal nerves are in general designated according to\r\n  the vertebræ behind which they emerge from the vertebral canal. In the\r\n  neck, however, there are eight pairs of nerves and only seven\r\n  vertebræ; here the first nerve emerges through the intervertebral\r\n  foramen of the atlas and the eighth between the last cervical and the\r\n  first thoracic vertebra.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the greater part of the thoracic region the spinal cord is fairly\r\nuniform in size, but there are two conspicuous wide enlargements which\r\ninvolve the segments with which the nerves of the limbs are connected.\r\nThe =cervical enlargement= (Intumescentia cervicalis) begins gradually\r\nin the fifth cervical vertebra and subsides in the second thoracic. Its\r\nmaximum transverse diameter is about an inch (ca. 25 mm.) and its\r\ndorso-ventral nearly half an inch (ca. 12 mm.). The =lumbar enlargement=\r\n(Intumescentia lumbalis) is situated in the fourth and fifth lumbar\r\nvertebræ. It is a little narrower than the cervical enlargement, and its\r\ndorso-ventral diameter is also slightly smaller. Behind this the cord\r\ntapers rapidly to form the =conus medullaris=. The tip of the latter is\r\ncontinued by a delicate glistening strand, the =filum terminale=, which\r\nis composed largely of fibrous tissue continued from the pia mater,\r\ncovered by arachnoid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 495.—VENTRAL VIEW OF MEDULLA OBLONGATA AND FIRST AND SECOND\r\n    SEGMENTS OF SPINAL CORD OF HORSE; THE MEMBRANES ARE CUT AND\r\n    REFLECTED.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Lig. suspensorium arachnoideale; _2_, right cerebrospinal artery;\r\n    _3_, _5_, digitations of lig. denticulatum; _4_, free border of lig.\r\n    denticulatum; _6_, middle spinal artery; _7_, basilar artery; _8_,\r\n    pons; _9_, arachnoidea; _10_, dura mater; _11_, _12_, ventral\r\n    root-bundles of first and second segments of spinal cord; _VI._, N.\r\n    abducens; _IX_, _X_, glossopharyngeus and vagus; _XI_, accessory,\r\n    medullary part; _XI′_, accessory, spinal part; _a_, line between\r\n    medulla oblongata and spinal cord.

(From Leisering’s Atlas, reduced.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe surface of the spinal cord is divided into two similar halves by a\r\n=dorsal median groove= (Sulcus medianus dorsalis) and a =ventral median\r\nfissure= (Fissura mediana ventralis). On either side of the former is\r\nthe =dorso-lateral groove= (Sulcus dorsalis lateralis) at which the\r\nfibers of the dorsal nerve-roots enter the cord; it is faint except at\r\nthe enlargements, and is represented by two grooves in the first\r\ncervical segment. The ventral root-fibers as they emerge from the cord\r\ndo not form a continuous series, but arise from a zone (Area radicularis\r\nventralis) 3 to 5 mm. in width a little lateral to the ventral median\r\nfissure, and no groove is found here. In the greater part of the\r\ncervical region and the anterior part of the thoracic region there is a\r\nshallow =dorsal paramedian groove= (Sulcus intermedius dorsalis) a short\r\ndistance lateral to the median groove. These grooves indicate the\r\ndivision of the white matter of the cord into columns to be described\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nExamination of cross-sections of the spinal cord shows that it is a\r\nbilaterally symmetrical structure, incompletely divided into right and\r\nleft halves by a ventral fissure and a dorsal septum. The =ventral\r\nmedian fissure= (Fissura mediana ventralis) is narrow and penetrates\r\nnearly to the middle of the dorso-ventral diameter of the cord. It is\r\noccupied by a fold of pia mater. The =dorsal median septum= (Septum\r\nmedianum dorsale) is a partition which descends from the posterior\r\nmedian groove to about the middle of the cord. It apparently consists of\r\ncondensed neuroglia with an admixture of pial tissue. The two halves of\r\nthe cord are connected by commissures of gray and white matter. The\r\n=gray commissure= (Commissura grisea) is a transverse band of gray\r\nmatter at the ventral end of the dorsal septum. It is divided into\r\ndorsal and ventral parts by the central canal of the cord. The =white\r\ncommissure= (Commissura alba) is a bridge of white matter which connects\r\nthe ventral columns of the cord over the dorsal end of the ventral\r\nmedian fissure, and constitutes a conducting path from one side to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 497.—CROSS-SECTION OF SPINAL CORD _in situ_, IN PART SCHEMATIC.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Dorsal column; _2_, lateral column; _3_, ventral column; _4_,\r\n    dorsal horn; _5_, ventral horn; _6_, gray commissure; _7_, white\r\n    commissure; _8_, central canal; _9_, dorsal septum; _10_, ventral\r\n    fissure; _11_, dorsal nerve-root; _12_, ventral nerve-root; _13_,\r\n    spinal ganglion; _14_, nerve; _15_, intervertebral foramen; _16_,\r\n    arch of vertebra; _17_, epidural space; _18_, dura mater\r\n    (represented a little too thick); _19_, ligamentum denticulatum;\r\n    _20_, _20_, longitudinal venous sinuses; _21_, middle spinal artery.\r\n    The subdural and subarachnoid spaces (black) are traversed by\r\n    delicate trabeculæ. The outer part of the arachnoid and the pia\r\n    mater are not shown.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =central canal= of the cord (Canalis centralis), the spinal vestige\r\nof the lumen of the embryonal neural tube, is a minute passage which\r\ntunnels the gray commissure. It opens at its anterior end into the\r\nposterior part of the fourth ventricle of the brain, and its terminal\r\npart in the conus medullaris forms a slight dilatation, the ventriculus\r\nterminalis. It is lined by epithelium and is surrounded by a layer of\r\nmodified neuroglia (Substantia grisea centralis).\r\n\r\nThe =gray matter= of the spinal cord as seen in cross-sections resembles\r\nroughly a capital =H= the cross-bar of the letter being formed by the\r\ngray commissure. Each lateral part is considered as consisting of\r\n=dorsal= and =ventral gray columns= or =horns= (Columna grisea dorsalis,\r\nventralis). In the greater part of the cord the dorsal column or horn is\r\nelongated and narrow and tapers to a point which extends almost to the\r\nsurface of the cord at the attachment of the dorsal root-fibers of the\r\nspinal nerves. Its apex or tip consists of gray matter which is lighter\r\nin color and less opaque than that of the rest of the horn and is termed\r\nthe =substantia gelatinosa= (Rolandi). The ventral column or horn is\r\nshort, thick and rounded, and is separated from the surface of the cord\r\nby a thick layer of white matter, through which the fibers of the\r\nventral roots of the spinal nerves pass. From the middle of the cervical\r\nregion to the lumbar region there is a medial projection of gray matter\r\non the lower part of the dorsal column; this is the =nucleus dorsalis=\r\nor Clarke’s column. In the anterior part of the cord there is an outward\r\nprojection of the gray matter at the base of the ventral horn; this is\r\ntermed the =lateral column= or =horn=. The demarcation between the gray\r\nand white matter is in many places indistinct; this is especially the\r\ncase laterally, where processes of gray matter extend into the white\r\nsubstance, producing what is known as the =formatio reticularis=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cross-sections of the spinal cord present the following gross regional\r\n  characters: (1) The cervical cord near the medulla is compressed\r\n  dorso-ventrally, its width is about 18 mm. and its greatest thickness\r\n  about 8 mm. It has dorsally a deep median sulcus and a distinct\r\n  dorso-lateral sulcus. Lateral grooves are also present. The dorsal\r\n  cornua are strongly everted. Each has an expanded head, which comes\r\n  very close to the surface of the cord, and has an extensive cap of\r\n  substantia gelatinosa. The neck is distinct. The ventral cornua are\r\n  short and blunt and diverge very little. The gray commissure is about\r\n  in the middle of the section and 2.5 mm. in length. According to\r\n  Dexler the column between the median and lateral grooves dorsally is\r\n  the funiculus cuneatus, the funiculus gracilis being very small and\r\n  not showing on the surface in this region. In the middle of the\r\n  cervical region the diameters are about 16 mm. and 10 mm.\r\n  respectively. The ventral surface is somewhat flattened. The dorsal\r\n  cornua have pointed ends and turn decidedly outward. The ventral\r\n  cornua are short and thick and are directed very slightly outward;\r\n  their ends are about 4 mm. from the ventral surface. The gray\r\n  commissure is just above the middle of the section and is about 2 mm.\r\n  long. The cervical enlargement measures about 25 mm. transversely and\r\n  12 mm. vertically. The dorsal cornua are smaller than the ventral and\r\n  have a large cap of substantia gelatinosa. The ventral cornua are\r\n  short and thick, curve strongly outward, and are about 4 mm. from the\r\n  ventral surface. Each bears a prominence on its inner side near the\r\n  base. The gray commissure is considerably above the middle of the\r\n  section and is about 4 mm. long. (2) In the middle of the thoracic\r\n  region the cross-section is biconvex, the ventral surface being the\r\n  more strongly curved. The transverse diameter is about 15 mm. and the\r\n  dorso-ventral about 10 mm. The gray columns are close together, the\r\n  gray commissure being only about 1 mm. in length, and lying\r\n  considerably above the middle of the section. The dorsal cornua are\r\n  short and have slightly enlarged ends. The ventral cornua have a\r\n  uniform diameter, turn very little outward, and end about 3 mm. from\r\n  the ventral surface. (3) The lumbar enlargement is much flattened,\r\n  especially dorsally. The transverse diameter is about 22 mm. and the\r\n  dorso-ventral 9 to 10 mm. The cornua are very large. The ventral\r\n  cornua are thick and rounded and turn sharply outward; they end about\r\n  2 mm. from the ventral surface. The dorsal cornua are smaller and\r\n  shorter and do not diverge so strongly. The gray commissure is about\r\n  in the middle of the section and is about 3 mm. long. In the third\r\n  lumbar vertebra the cord is about 3 mm. narrower and thicker, and both\r\n  surfaces are about equally convex. The dorsal cornua are smaller,\r\n  considerably everted, and constricted in the middle. The ventral\r\n  cornua are very short and do not turn outward. (4) In the first sacral\r\n  vertebra the cord is almost round and is 5 to 6 mm. in diameter; the\r\n  cornua are relatively very large and the commissure has the form of a\r\n  high intermediate mass.\r\n\r\n  The ventral horn contains large cells, the axones of which emerge as\r\n  the fibers of the ventral nerve-roots (Fila radicularia). The axones\r\n  of many cells cross to the opposite side in the white commissure and\r\n  pass out in a ventral root of that side, or enter the white matter and\r\n  pass forward and backward, associating various segments of the cord.\r\n  Some pass to the ventral horn of the opposite side at the same or at\r\n  different levels. Others pass to the periphery of the cord, join the\r\n  cerebellospinal fasciculus, and extend to the cerebellum. Scattered\r\n  through the gray matter are many smaller cells with axones which\r\n  pursue a short course and serve to connect different parts of the gray\r\n  matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =white matter= of the spinal cord is divided into three pairs of\r\n=columns=. The =dorsal columns= (Funiculi dorsales) lie on either side\r\nof the dorsal median septum and extend outward to the dorso-lateral\r\ngroove and the dorsal gray column. The =ventral columns= (Funiculi\r\nventrales) are situated on either side between the median fissure and\r\nthe ventral gray columns. They are connected above the fissure by the\r\nwhite commissure. The =lateral columns= (Funiculi laterales) lie\r\nexternal to the gray columns on either side; their limits are indicated\r\nsuperficially by the dorso-lateral groove and the emergence of the\r\nventral root-fibers. The paramedian groove (where present) indicates a\r\nsubdivision of the dorsal column into two fasciculi or tracts; the inner\r\nof these is the =fasciculus gracilis= (Goll’s column); the outer, the\r\n=fasciculus cuneatus= (Burdach’s column).\r\n\r\nThe amounts of gray and white matter vary greatly in different parts of\r\nthe cord both absolutely and relatively. In cross-section the absolute\r\nareas of both are greatest in the enlargements. The relative area of\r\ngray matter is smallest in the thoracic region (except at its anterior\r\nend), and increases from the lumbar enlargement backward.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Investigations have shown that in man the columns of white matter are\r\n  subdivided into fasciculi or tracts, which constitute definite\r\n  conducting paths of greater or less length. Our knowledge of the\r\n  tracts in the domesticated animals is very limited, and it is quite\r\n  unsafe to make inferences from the arrangement in man. As evidence of\r\n  this it may be noted that the ventral cerebrospinal or direct\r\n  pyramidal tract of man cannot be recognized as such.\r\n\r\n  The dorsal white columns consist essentially of two sets of axones.\r\n  The afferent or sensory axones which come from the cells of the spinal\r\n  ganglia enter as the dorsal roots of the spinal nerves and divide into\r\n  two branches in the vicinity of the dorsal gray column. The anterior\r\n  (ascending) branches form the direct sensory path to the brain and\r\n  extend in the fasciculus cuneatus and fasciculus gracilis or\r\n  corresponding tracts to nuclei in the medulla oblongata. The posterior\r\n  (descending) branches extend backward for varying distances and give\r\n  off numerous collaterals to cells of the gray column, thus forming\r\n  part of the mechanism for the mediation of reflex action. Some\r\n  collaterals cross in the white commissure to the opposite side. Many\r\n  of these fibers are collected in the comma-shaped tract between the\r\n  fasciculus gracilis and cuneatus. The second set of axones arises from\r\n  the smaller cells of the gray column. They enter the white matter,\r\n  divide into anterior and posterior branches, forming the fasciculi\r\n  proprii or ground bundles of the cord. Some branches cross to the\r\n  opposite side. The function of this set of axones is chiefly to\r\n  associate various levels of the cord.\r\n\r\n  The lateral columns contain some axones of the dorsal nerve-roots,\r\n  which (in man) are grouped in the marginal tract of Lissauer, situated\r\n  just dorsal to the apex of the dorsal horn. The cerebellospinal\r\n  fasciculus (direct cerebellar tract of Flechsig) extends along the\r\n  periphery of the lateral column. It contains the axones of the cells\r\n  of the nucleus dorsalis (Clarke’s column), which proceed to the\r\n  medulla oblongata and enter the cerebellum by the restiform body. The\r\n  rubrospinal tract of Monakow appears to take the place of the lateral\r\n  cerebrospinal fasciculus or crossed pyramidal tract of man. It lies at\r\n  the inner side of the cerebellospinal fasciculus. Its fibers arise in\r\n  the nucleus ruber of the mid-brain, cross the median plane\r\n  (decussation of Forel), and pass backward in the tegmentum and medulla\r\n  oblongata to the lateral column of the cord. It is a path for motor\r\n  impulses coming from the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. The\r\n  lateral fasciculus proprius or ground-bundle is deeply situated at the\r\n  side of the gray columns. The bulk of its fibers are axones of cells\r\n  of the posterior cornu which divide into anterior and posterior\r\n  branches. They are intersegmental paths which associate different\r\n  levels of the gray matter of the cord. The significance of the\r\n  remaining fibers is not yet known.\r\n\r\n  The ventral white columns do not contain a ventral cerebrospinal or\r\n  direct pyramidal tract, as in man. There is a small tract (Fasciculus\r\n  intracommissuralis ventralis) above the white commissure, which\r\n  separates it from the rest of the ventral column. It extends to the\r\n  middle of the thoracic region. It consists of intersegmental fibers,\r\n  and contains in the anterior part of the cervical cord in the sheep\r\n  and goat both crossed and direct pyramidal fibers. The descending\r\n  cerebellospinal fasciculus extends from the cerebellum to the lumbar\r\n  region. In the cervical region it occupies a semilunar area which\r\n  reaches almost to the surface ventro-laterally. Scattered fibers\r\n  belonging to it lie also in the medial part of the ventral column.\r\n  Posteriorly it diminishes in size and comes to occupy a position next\r\n  to the ventral median fissure, corresponding to the sulco-marginal\r\n  fasciculus of man (Dexler).\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE BRAIN\r\n\r\nThe =brain= or =encephalon= is the part of the central nervous system\r\nthat is situated in the cranial cavity. It is the enlarged and highly\r\nmodified cephalic part of the primitive neural tube. It conforms rather\r\nclosely in size and shape to the cavity in which it lies.\r\n\r\nIts average weight without the dura mater is about 23 ounces (ca. 650\r\ngm.), and forms about ⅐ of 1 per cent. of the body-weight.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to examine the general external configuration of the\r\nbrain before studying its various parts in detail.[187]\r\n\r\nWhen divested of its membranes and vessels (Figs. 499, 500), its ventral\r\nsurface or base presents the median =brain stem=, which is continuous\r\nwith the spinal cord without any natural line of demarcation; it divides\r\nin front into two branches, the cerebral peduncles, each of which\r\ndisappears into the mass of the corresponding cerebral hemisphere. The\r\nbrain stem consists of three parts. The =medulla oblongata= is the\r\nposterior part which extends forward as the direct continuation of the\r\nspinal cord. The =pons= (Varolii) is a transversely elongated mass which\r\nappears to turn up on either side into the cerebellum. The =cerebral\r\npeduncles= extend forward from the pons and diverge to plunge into the\r\nventral part of the cerebral hemispheres. The area between them is the\r\n=interpeduncular= space. It is largely covered by the =pituitary body=\r\nor =hypophysis=, a yellowish-brown, discoid structure, which is\r\nconnected with the base of the cerebrum by a delicate tube called the\r\n=infundibulum=.[188] On drawing the pituitary body gently aside, the\r\ninfundibulum is seen to be attached to a slight gray eminence, the\r\n=tuber cinereum=. Behind this is the =mammillary body=, a well-marked\r\nround prominence. The posterior part of the space is perforated by\r\nnumerous openings for the passage of small arteries, and hence is termed\r\nthe =locus perforatus posticus=. Two large bands of white matter, the\r\n=optic tracts=, cross the anterior ends of the cerebral peduncles and\r\nunite at the =optic chiasm= or =commissure=, forming the anterior\r\nboundary of the interpeduncular space. Above and in front of the chiasm\r\nthe hemispheres are separated by the median =longitudinal fissure=. In\r\ncontact with the anterior extremity of each hemisphere is the =olfactory\r\nbulb=, an oval enlargement adapted to the ethmoidal fossa of the\r\ncranium. This appears as a gray swelling on a wide flat band, the\r\n=olfactory peduncle=, which is continued behind by two divergent bands,\r\nthe =olfactory tracts= or =striæ=. The =internal tract= disappears after\r\na very short course on to the inner surface of the hemisphere. The\r\n=external tract= is larger and longer; it runs backward, inclines at\r\nfirst outward and then curves inward and disappears on the concealed or\r\ntentorial surface of the hemispheres. It is separated from the lateral\r\ncerebral gyri by a distinct groove (Sulcus rhinalis). Along the inner\r\nside of the stria are two eminences. The anterior of these is the\r\n=trigonum olfactorium=, a gray elevation situated in the angle of\r\ndivergence of the inner and outer striæ. Behind this is a depression,\r\nthe =fossa transversa=,[189] which is continued across the external\r\nstria and sharply limits the second and much larger eminence, the\r\n=pyriform lobe=.\r\n\r\nThe superficial origins of most of the cranial nerves are visible on the\r\nbase of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe =olfactory nerve-fibers= join the convex surface of the olfactory\r\nlobe and give it a shaggy appearance in specimens which have been\r\nremoved intact—a difficult proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe =second= or =optic nerves= converge to the optic chiasm.\r\n\r\nThe =third= or =oculomotor nerve= arises from the inner part of the\r\ncerebral peduncle.\r\n\r\nThe =fourth= or =trochlear nerve= may be seen emerging between the pons\r\nand the hemisphere, but its connection with the brain is not visible.\r\n\r\nThe =fifth= or =trigeminal nerve= is connected with the lateral part of\r\nthe pons.\r\n\r\nThe =sixth= or =abducent nerve= arises just behind the pons and lateral\r\nto the pyramid of the medulla.\r\n\r\nThe =seventh= or =facial= and the =eighth= or =auditory nerves= arise\r\nclose together just behind the pons proper on the extremity of the\r\ncorpus trapezoideum.\r\n\r\nThe =ninth= or =glosso-pharyngeal=, the =tenth= or =vagus=, and the\r\n=eleventh= or =spinal accessory nerves= are connected by a linear series\r\nof roots with the lateral aspect of the ventral surface of the medulla.\r\nThe spinal part of the accessory nerve comes forward along the edge of\r\nthe medulla to join its medullary root.\r\n\r\nThe =twelfth= or =hypoglossal nerve= arises from the posterior part of\r\nthe medulla along the lateral edge of the pyramid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 498.—BRAIN OF HORSE, DORSAL VIEW, ABOUT ⁵⁄₇ NATURAL SIZE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Entomarginal fissure; _2_, marginal fissure; _3_, ectomarginal\r\n    fissure; _4_, suprasylvian fissure.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe parts that are visible when the brain is viewed from above are the\r\ncerebral hemispheres, the cerebellum, and part of the medulla oblongata.\r\nThe =cerebral hemispheres= form an ovoid mass, and are separated from\r\neach other by the median =longitudinal fissure=, in which the falx\r\ncerebri is situated. Their surfaces are marked by thick folds, the =gyri\r\ncerebri=, separated by =sulci=. The upturned ends of the =olfactory\r\nbulbs= are seen in front of the frontal poles of the hemispheres. The\r\noccipital poles of the hemispheres overlie the anterior part of the\r\ncerebellum, from which they are separated by the =transverse fissure=\r\nand the tentorium cerebelli contained in it. The =cerebellum= is a much\r\nsmaller rounded mass which conceals the greater part of the medulla\r\noblongata. Its surface is divided into a middle lobe, the =vermis=, and\r\ntwo lateral =hemispheres=. It is marked by numerous gyri and narrow\r\nsulci which have in general a transverse direction. The posterior third\r\nof the =medulla oblongata= is not covered by the cerebellum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The brain is developed from the expanded cephalic part of the neural\r\n  tube of the embryo. The process comprises a series of thickenings,\r\n  flexures, and unequal growth and expansion of various parts of the\r\n  tube. In the higher animals the result is that the tubular character\r\n  of the brain is not very evident, since the lumen comes to consist of\r\n  four irregular cavities, the ventricles, which are connected by narrow\r\n  passages. The tube is first subdivided by two constrictions into three\r\n  brain vesicles, termed respectively the hind-brain or rhombencephalon,\r\n  the mid-brain or mesencephalon, and the fore-brain or prosencephalon.\r\n  The hind-brain gives rise to three secondary segments and the\r\n  fore-brain to two. The annexed table indicates the origin of the\r\n  principal structures of the fully developed brain from the primitive\r\n  vesicles. It has become customary to describe the brain with reference\r\n  to its embryological relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n   TABLE INDICATING THE DERIVATION OF THE PRINCIPAL PARTS OF THE BRAIN\r\n PRIMARY SEGMENTS.│    Secondary    │  DERIVATIVES.   │    CAVITIES.\r\n                  │    SEGMENTS.    │                 │\r\n Rhombencephalon  │                 │                 │\r\n   (posterior     │Myelencephalon   │Medulla oblongata│Fourth ventricle\r\n   vesicle)       │                 │                 │\r\n         „        │Metencephalon    │Pons             │        „\r\n         „        │        „        │Cerebellum       │        „\r\n                  │Isthmus          │Anterior         │\r\n         „        │  rhombencephali │  cerebellar     │        „\r\n                  │                 │  peduncles      │\r\n         „        │        „        │Anterior         │        „\r\n                  │                 │  medullary velum│\r\n Mesencephalon    │                 │Corpora          │\r\n   (middle        │Mesencephalon    │  quadrigemina   │Cerebral aqueduct\r\n   vesicle)       │                 │                 │\r\n         „        │        „        │Cerebral         │        „\r\n                  │                 │  peduncles      │\r\n Prosencephalon   │                 │{Optic thalami   │Posterior part of\r\n   (anterior      │Diencephalon     │               } │  third ventricle\r\n   vesicle)       │                 │                 │\r\n         „        │        „        │{Subthalamic     │        „\r\n                  │                 │  tegmenta       │\r\n         „        │        „        │{Pineal body     │        „\r\n                  │                 │                 │Anterior part of\r\n                  │                 │                 │  third\r\n                  │                 │{Pituitary body  │  ventricle.\r\n         „        │Telencephalon    │              }  │  Lateral\r\n                  │                 │                 │  ventricles and\r\n                  │                 │                 │  olfactory\r\n                  │                 │                 │  continuations.\r\n         „        │        „        │{Optic nerves and│        „\r\n                  │                 │  retinæ         │\r\n         „        │        „        │{Cerebral        │        „\r\n                  │                 │  hemispheres    │\r\n         „        │        „        │{Olfactory tracts│        „\r\n                  │                 │  and bulb       │\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE RHOMBENCEPHALON\r\n\r\nTHE MEDULLA OBLONGATA\r\n\r\nThe =medulla oblongata= lies on the basilar part of the occipital bone.\r\nIt is quadrilateral in outline, but much wider in front than behind, and\r\ncompressed dorso-ventrally. Its length, measured from the root of the\r\nfirst cervical nerve to the pons, is about two inches (ca. 5 cm.).\r\n\r\nIts =ventral surface= is convex in the transverse direction. It is\r\nmarked by a =median fissure= (Fissura mediana ventralis) which is\r\ncontinuous behind with the similar fissure of the spinal cord. The\r\nposterior part of the fissure is faintly marked, but in front it becomes\r\ndeeper and ends in a small depression (Foramen cæcum) behind the central\r\npart of a transverse band, the =corpus trapezoideum=. On either side of\r\nthe fissure is a rounded tract, the =pyramid= (Pyramis), which is\r\nbounded externally by a faint lateral groove (Sulcus intermedius\r\nventralis). The pyramids join the pons in front; behind they become\r\nnarrower and disappear into the substance of the medulla, in which their\r\nfibers intercross, forming the =decussation of the pyramids= (Decussatio\r\npyramidum).[190]\r\n\r\nThe superficial origin of the =sixth cranial nerve= (N. oculomotorius)\r\nis just lateral to the anterior end of the pyramid. The =corpus\r\ntrapezoideum= is a transverse band which extends across the surface\r\nimmediately behind the pons. It is crossed by the pyramids, which cut\r\noff a small central part. The lateral part extends out to the roots of\r\nthe seventh and eighth nerves on either side. Behind the outer part of\r\nthe corpus trapezoideum there is a variably developed rounded eminence,\r\nthe =tuberculum faciale=. The root-fibers of the twelfth or hypoglossal\r\nnerve form an oblique linear series lateral to the posterior part of the\r\npyramid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 499.—BASE OF BRAIN OF HORSE, NATURAL SIZE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal surface= is largely concealed by the cerebellum and forms\r\nthe greater part of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The =dorsal\r\nmedian fissure= (Fissura mediana dorsalis), the direct continuation of\r\nthe corresponding groove of the spinal cord, extends forward to about\r\nthe middle of the surface. Here the =restiform bodies=, which constitute\r\nthe lips of the fissure, diverge to form the lateral boundaries of a\r\ntriangular depression; this is the posterior part of the rhomboid fossa\r\nor floor of the fourth ventricle of the brain. The dorso-lateral fissure\r\nwinds outward and forward to the lateral aspect of the medulla, where it\r\npresents the roots of the =ninth=, =tenth=, and =eleventh cranial\r\nnerves=. External to it is a distinct oval eminence on the anterior part\r\nof the lateral column, termed the =tuberculum cinereum=. The central\r\ncanal of the cord is continued in the posterior part of the medulla,\r\ninclines dorsally, and opens in the posterior angle of the fourth\r\nventricle. Hence it is customary to distinguish a closed and an open\r\npart of the medulla. The dorsal aspect of the latter, which is concealed\r\nat present, will be considered later in the description of the fourth\r\nventricle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 500.—LINE DRAWING OF BASE OF BRAIN OF HORSE. (KEY TO FIG. 499.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe lateral surface is narrow behind, wider and rounded in front. From\r\nit the root-fibers of the ninth, tenth, and eleventh cranial nerves\r\narise in a linear series, and alongside of it the spinal part of the\r\neleventh nerve passes forward to join the medullary root. Close\r\ninspection reveals the presence of striæ which curve obliquely downward\r\nand backward from the surface of the restiform body toward the\r\nhypoglossal root-fibers; these are the =external arcuate fibers= (Fibræ\r\narcuatæ externæ). The recess between the lateral aspect of the medulla\r\nand the cerebellum is occupied by an irregular mass of villous\r\nprojections of the pia mater, containing tufts of vessels; this is the\r\n=chorioid plexus of the fourth ventricle=, and is the lateral edge of\r\nthe =tela chorioidea= of the ventricle. On raising the chorioid plexus\r\nit is seen that the tela chorioidea is attached to the dorsal aspect of\r\nthe medulla, and reinforces here the wall of the fourth ventricle; also\r\nthat the restiform body terminates in front by entering the base of the\r\ncerebellum, forming its posterior peduncle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the medulla the fiber tracts of the spinal cord either terminate in\r\n  the nuclei of the gray matter or undergo changes in their relative\r\n  position, and new tracts appear. The gray matter is highly modified\r\n  and forms masses which have no homologues in the cord. The central\r\n  canal of the closed part of the medulla is surrounded by a thicker\r\n  layer of gray matter than is the case in the spinal cord. As the\r\n  medulla opens out this gray matter is naturally spread in the floor of\r\n  the fourth ventricle. The dorsal horns of gray matter become wide,\r\n  spread apart, and are broken up to a great extent in the formatio\r\n  reticularis. Two elongated masses of cells appear above the central\r\n  gray matter; these are the =nucleus gracilis= and =nucleus cuneatus=,\r\n  and in them the fasciculi of like name gradually end. In front of\r\n  these are the =terminal nuclei= of the afferent or sensory cranial\r\n  nerves and of the sensory portions of the mixed nerves. The ventral\r\n  horns are succeeded by the nuclei of =origin= of the efferent or motor\r\n  cranial nerves and the motor root-fibers of the mixed nerves. Of the\r\n  twelve pairs of cranial nerves, the last eight are connected with\r\n  nuclei in the medulla and pons. The =posterior olivary nucleus=\r\n  (Nucleus olivaris caudalis) is a conspicuous gray mass which lies\r\n  above the pyramid on each side. On cross-sections it appears as a wavy\r\n  layer of gray matter which is folded on itself so as to inclose a mass\r\n  of white matter. It is about 2 cm. long in the horse, but is smaller\r\n  in circumference than in man and hence does not cause any very\r\n  distinct external enlargement (olivary eminence), as in the latter. It\r\n  is connected with the opposite side of the cerebellum by the\r\n  cerebello-olivary fibers. At its inner side are two small accessory\r\n  olivary nuclei. The =pyramidal tracts=, which are small in ungulates,\r\n  send most of their fibers across to the opposite side in the posterior\r\n  part of the medulla, forming the =pyramidal decussation=. Some fibers,\r\n  however, continue in the ventral column of the same side of the cord,\r\n  and others are connected with the nuclei of the motor nerve-roots.\r\n  From the nucleus gracilis and nucleus cuneatus fibers arise which are\r\n  traceable forward to the thalamus. These are the =internal arcuate\r\n  fibers= (Fibræ arcuatæ internæ), which curve across the median plane\r\n  below the central gray matter and form with those of the opposite side\r\n  the =decussation of the fillet= (Decussatio lemniscorum). Beyond the\r\n  decussation the fibers form an important longitudinal tract which\r\n  extends forward in the mid-brain. This is the =fillet= or =lemniscus=,\r\n  the chief continuation of the sensory conducting path from the dorsal\r\n  roots of the spinal nerves. The =external arcuate fibers=, some of\r\n  which were seen on the lateral aspect of the medulla, have a similar\r\n  origin. Part of them (Fibræ dorsales) pass directly to the dorsal\r\n  aspect of the restiform body of the same side; others (Fibræ\r\n  ventrales) cross to the opposite side, descend close to the ventral\r\n  fissure, and then curve upward and forward to the restiform body. The\r\n  decussation of the arcuate fibers forms the distinct median =raphé=\r\n  seen on cross-sections of the medulla anterior to the pyramidal\r\n  decussation. The restiform body, situated dorso-laterally, contains,\r\n  in addition to the arcuate fibers, the =cerebello-olivary fasciculus=\r\n  before mentioned, and the =cerebellospinal fasciculus= or direct\r\n  cerebellar tract. The =dorsal longitudinal fasciculus= corresponds to\r\n  the ventral ground-bundle of the spinal cord, displaced dorsally by\r\n  the decussation of the pyramids and fillet. In the posterior part of\r\n  the medulla it is not marked off from the fillet, along the dorsal\r\n  edge of which it lies. From the level of the hypoglossal nucleus\r\n  forward it is distinct and can be traced as a conspicuous tract in the\r\n  ventral margin of the gray matter of the floor of the fourth ventricle\r\n  and of the central gray matter of the mid-brain. Below the restiform\r\n  body and related externally to the external arcuate fibers, there is a\r\n  considerable bundle of longitudinal fibers, the =spinal root= (Tractus\r\n  spinalis) =of the fifth nerve=; internal to it is the terminal nucleus\r\n  of the sensory root of the nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 501.—BRAIN OF HORSE, LEFT LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The larger arteries are shown.

(Ellenberger-Baum,\r\n    Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =pons= (Varolii) is that part of the brain stem which lies between\r\nthe medulla and the cerebral peduncles; it is marked off from these\r\nventrally by anterior and posterior grooves. Viewed from below it is\r\nelongated transversely, convex in both directions, and presents a wide\r\nshallow median groove (Sulcus basilaris), which lodges the basilar\r\nartery. Laterally a large part of its mass curves upward and backward\r\ninto the base of the cerebellum, forming the =middle cerebellar\r\npeduncle= (Brachium pontis). The superficial origin of the trigeminal\r\n(fifth) nerve is at the lateral limit of the ventral surface. Transverse\r\nstriations indicate the course of its superficial (ventral) fibers which\r\nconnect the two sides of the cerebellum. The dorsal surface is blended\r\non either side with the overlying anterior peduncles of the cerebellum;\r\nthe central free portion forms the anterior part of the floor of the\r\nfourth ventricle, and will be considered in the account of that cavity.\r\n\r\n\r\n  On cross-section the pons is seen to be composed of dorsal and ventral\r\n  parts. The =dorsal part= (Pars dorsalis pontis) consists superficially\r\n  of a layer of gray matter covered by the ependyma of the fourth\r\n  ventricle. Beneath this the median raphé of the medulla is continued\r\n  into the pons, dividing it into similar halves. In the anterior part\r\n  of the pons the fillet divides into an inner and outer part, the\r\n  =medial= and =lateral fillets= (Lemniscus medialis, lateralis); the\r\n  latter arches outward to reach the outer side of the anterior\r\n  cerebellar peduncle. The =dorsal longitudinal fasciculus= becomes\r\n  sharply defined into a round bundle which lies close to the raphé\r\n  under the gray matter of the floor of the fourth ventricle. In\r\n  cross-section the =formatio reticularis= forms a large area below the\r\n  superficial gray matter and the longitudinal bundles. Dorso-laterally\r\n  is the large rounded section of the =anterior cerebellar peduncle=.\r\n  Lower down is a large bundle, the =sensory root of the fifth nerve=.\r\n  In front of this is the =motor nucleus= of the same nerve, external to\r\n  which is its =motor root=. The =ventral part= of the pons (Pars\r\n  basilaris pontis) is composed of transverse and longitudinal fibers,\r\n  and a large amount of gray matter which is broken up into small masses\r\n  (Nuclei pontis) by the intersection of the fibers. The =transverse\r\n  fibers= are gathered laterally into a compact mass which turns upward\r\n  and backward and enters the central white matter of the cerebellum,\r\n  forming the =middle cerebellar peduncle=. Centrally the fibers are\r\n  arranged in bundles which intercross. The transverse fibers are\r\n  chiefly of two kinds. Some arise from the Purkinje cells of the\r\n  cerebellar cortex and pass either to the opposite side of the\r\n  cerebellum or turn at the raphé and run forward and backward in the\r\n  brain stem. Others are axones of cells of the nuclei pontis, and pass\r\n  to the hemispheres of the cerebellum. The corpus trapezoideum is\r\n  mainly the central continuation of the cochlear division of the\r\n  auditory nerve. Above it is the small =anterior olivary nucleus=\r\n  (Nucleus olivaris nasalis). The =longitudinal fibers= of the ventral\r\n  part of the pons consist chiefly of the =cerebrospinal= or =pyramidal\r\n  fasciculi=. These come from the ventral part (pes) of the cerebral\r\n  peduncles and are situated laterally, interspersed among the deep\r\n  transverse fibers in the anterior part of the pons. Toward the\r\n  posterior part the bundles incline toward the median plane and become\r\n  collected into a compact mass which appears superficially at the\r\n  posterior border. Many fibers come from the cerebral cortex and\r\n  terminate in the nuclei of the gray matter of the pons; they may be\r\n  designated =corticopontile fibers=.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE CEREBELLUM\r\n\r\nThe =cerebellum= is situated in the posterior fossa of the cranium, and\r\nis separated from the cerebral hemispheres by the transverse fissure and\r\nthe tentorium cerebelli which occupies it. It overlies the pons and the\r\ngreater part of the medulla, from which it is separated by the fourth\r\nventricle. Its average weight is about two ounces (ca. 60 gm.) or about\r\n9 per cent. of the weight of the entire brain. Its shape is\r\napproximately globular but very irregular. It is somewhat compressed\r\ndorso-ventrally and its transverse diameter is the greatest.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior surface= faces upward and forward and is covered partially\r\nby the tentorium cerebelli. The =posterior surface= is almost vertical.\r\nThe =ventral surface= or =base= lies over the fourth ventricle, and is\r\nconnected by three pairs of peduncles with the medulla, pons, and\r\nmid-brain.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to recognize three gross divisions of the cerebellum,\r\nviz., the median vermis and two lateral hemispheres. The =vermis=\r\n(cerebelli) is curved in a circular manner so that its two extremities\r\nare close together or even in contact on the ventral surface. The\r\nanterior extremity is termed the =lingula=; it lies between the\r\ncerebellar peduncles and gives attachment to the =anterior medullary\r\nvelum=, a thin lamina which forms the anterior part of the roof of the\r\nfourth ventricle. The posterior extremity, the =nodulus=, gives\r\nattachment to the =posterior medullary velum= which covers the posterior\r\nrecess of the fourth ventricle. The =hemispheres= (Hemisphæria\r\ncerebelli) are clearly separated from the vermis by two deep paramedian\r\nfissures. They lie in the lateral depressions of the cerebellar\r\ncompartment of the cranium.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In tracing the fissures from behind forward it will be noticed that\r\n  they are nearly sagittal as far as the anterior surface, where they\r\n  diverge widely, so that the vermis forms all of the fore part of the\r\n  cerebellum.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe surface of the cerebellum is further cut up into numerous =gyri= or\r\n=folia= by narrow and relatively deep =sulci=, many of which approach a\r\ntransverse direction. Certain of the sulci are more pronounced than the\r\nothers, and by means of them it is possible to define groups of gyri.\r\nSuch groups are termed =lobes=, and have received specific names,\r\nderived chiefly from the systematic descriptions of the human\r\ncerebellum.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The lobes of the vermis are readily distinguished on a median section.\r\n  Enumerated from the anterior to the posterior extremity they are: (1)\r\n  lingula, (2) lobus centralis, (3) lobus ascendens, (4) lobus culminis,\r\n  (5) lobus clivi, (6) tuber vermis, (7) pyramis, (8) uvula, (9)\r\n  nodulus. Each hemisphere is cut into laterally by two sulci which mark\r\n  off two sagittal discoid masses, termed by Ziehen tabulations. The\r\n  external tabulation consists of four or five lobules, the lowest of\r\n  which is regarded as the flocculus. The inner part of the hemisphere\r\n  is divided into three or four lobes. In the absence of a satisfactory\r\n  morphological basis it seems undesirable to deal with the lobation of\r\n  the cerebellum in further detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =cerebellar peduncles=, three on each side, join the central white\r\nmatter of the cerebellum at the base. The =posterior peduncle= is the\r\nrestiform body of the medulla, a large rounded tract derived from the\r\nlateral and ventral columns of the cord. Near the middle of the medulla\r\nit inclines outward, forms the lateral wall of the fourth ventricle, and\r\nends by entering the central white matter of the cerebellum. The =middle\r\npeduncle= is formed, as previously seen, by the brachium pontis. The\r\n=anterior peduncles= (Brachia conjunctiva) pass forward on either side\r\non the dorsal surface of the pons, forming the lateral boundary of the\r\nfore part of the fourth ventricle. They disappear under the corpora\r\nquadrigemina into the substance of the mid-brain. At the point of\r\ndisappearance the =trochlear= (fourth) =nerve= emerges from the\r\nmid-brain. In some cases two or three bundles of fibers (Fila lateralia\r\npontis) arise in the angle between the middle and anterior peduncle,\r\ncurve obliquely forward and downward over the outer aspect of the\r\nlatter, and spread out on the ventral face of the cerebral peduncle just\r\nin front of the pons.\r\n\r\nOn sagittal section the cerebellum is seen to consist of a layer of\r\n=cortical gray matter= (Substantia corticalis) and the =medullary white\r\nmatter=. The white matter consists of a large =basal mass= (Corpus\r\nmedullare), which is joined by the peduncles, and gives off primary\r\nlaminæ to the lobules; from these secondary and tertiary laminæ arise,\r\nthe latter entering the gyri. The arrangement on sagittal section is\r\ntree-like, hence the classical term “arbor vitæ” which is applied to it.\r\nThe central gray matter consists of groups of cells which form small\r\n=nuclei= embedded in the central white substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  As noted above the central gray matter does not form a large nucleus,\r\n  the corpus dentatum, which is so conspicuous an object on sagittal\r\n  sections of the cerebellar hemisphere in man.\r\n\r\n  The principal connections established by the peduncular fibers of the\r\n  cerebellum are as follows: The posterior peduncle (Corpus restiforme)\r\n  is composed of afferent and efferent fibers which connect the\r\n  cerebellum with the medulla and spinal cord. The =cerebellospinal\r\n  fasciculus= or =direct cerebellar tract=, which arises from the cells\r\n  of the nucleus dorsalis (Clarke’s column) of the cord, ends in the\r\n  cortex of the vermis; many of its fibers cross to the opposite side.\r\n  Numerous =arcuate fibers= from the nucleus gracilis and nucleus\r\n  cuneatus of the same and opposite sides establish connections with\r\n  =cells= of the cerebellar cortex. =Olivocerebellar= fibers (chiefly\r\n  afferent) connect with the olivary nucleus of the same and of the\r\n  opposite side of the medulla oblongata. The =nucleo-cerebellar\r\n  fasciculus= comprises fibers derived from the nuclei of the fifth,\r\n  eighth, and tenth cranial nerves (Edinger). The =descending\r\n  cerebellospinal fasciculus= consists of fibers which terminate in\r\n  relation with cells of the ventral horns of the spinal cord. The chief\r\n  facts concerning the middle peduncle have been mentioned in the\r\n  description of the pons. The anterior peduncle is essentially an\r\n  efferent tract, the fibers of which pass forward to the tegmentum of\r\n  the cerebral peduncle, the subthalamic region, and the thalamus. After\r\n  the peduncles disappear under the corpora quadrigemina, they converge\r\n  and many of their fibers intercross, forming the =decussation of the\r\n  superior peduncle=. A considerable number of fibers end in the nucleus\r\n  ruber. Thence impulses are transmitted in two directions: first, by\r\n  =thalamo-cortical fibers= to the cerebral cortex; second, by the\r\n  =rubrospinal tract= through the brain stem and lateral columns of the\r\n  cord to the ventral horn cells. The ventro-lateral cerebellospinal\r\n  fasciculus (Gowers’ tract) is an ill-defined tract which connects the\r\n  spinal cord with the cerebellum. Its fibers appear to be axones of\r\n  cells of the posterior horns of the cord; they pass in the lateral\r\n  column of the cord, become scattered in passing through the reticular\r\n  formation of the medulla and pons, and enter the cerebellum by way of\r\n  the anterior medullary velum.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE FOURTH VENTRICLE\r\n\r\nThe =fourth ventricle= (Ventriculus quartus) is the cavity of the\r\nrhombencephalon; it communicates with the central canal of the spinal\r\ncord behind, and through the aqueduct with the third ventricle in front.\r\nIt is somewhat rhomboid in outline, elongated from before backward and\r\nnarrowest behind. It is lined completely by an epithelium (Ependyma) and\r\ncontains a small amount of fluid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 504.—BRAIN STEM AND BASAL GANGLIA OF HORSE, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The cranial nerve-roots are designated by Roman numerals.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIts =floor= (Fossa rhomboidea) is formed by the =medulla= and =pons= and\r\nis marked by three longitudinal furrows which converge behind. It is\r\nwidest and deepest a little in front of its middle. The posterior part\r\nnarrows to a point at the opening of the central canal, and on account\r\nof its appearance in man it has been termed the calamus scriptorius. The\r\n=median sulcus= (Sulcus medianus) extends the entire length of the floor\r\nand is deepest toward the ends. The =limiting sulci= (Sulci limitantes)\r\nbegin on either side of the opening of the central canal and extend\r\nforward as the lateral limits of the rhomboid fossa. Just beyond the\r\nmiddle of the fossa they expand into a shallow depression, the =anterior\r\nfovea= (Fovea nasalis). On either side of the median sulcus and margined\r\nby the limiting sulcus is a slightly rounded column, the =eminentia\r\nmedialis=. Opposite the fovea this presents an elongated prominence, the\r\n=colliculus facialis=, so named because it overlies the bend formed by\r\nthe fibers of origin of the facial nerve. External to the limiting\r\nsulcus is a long fusiform elevation, the =area acustica=, from which a\r\nband of fibers (Striæ acusticæ) winds over the anterior end of the\r\nrestiform body to the superficial origin of the cochlear nerve.\r\n\r\nThe =lateral wall= is formed by the restiform body and the anterior\r\npeduncle of the cerebellum.\r\n\r\nThe =roof= is formed in its middle part by the vermis of the cerebellum,\r\ncovered by the epithelium before mentioned. There is commonly a dorsal\r\nrecess (Recessus tecti s. fastigium) between the extremities of the\r\nvermis. The anterior part of the roof is formed by a thin lamina of\r\nwhite substance, the =anterior medullary velum= (or valve of Vieussens),\r\nwhich extends backward from the corpora quadrigemina, and is attached on\r\neither side to the anterior peduncles of the cerebellum. Its anterior\r\npart is relatively thick and contains the decussation of the fibers of\r\nthe trochlear nerves. Posteriorly it blends with the white matter of the\r\ncerebellum. A thin lamina of white matter, the =posterior medullary\r\nvelum=, backed by pia mater, completes the roof posteriorly. After\r\nremoval of the cerebellum the line of attachment (Tænia ventriculi\r\nquarti) to the medulla is seen; it begins centrally over the opening of\r\nthe central canal, runs forward on the inner face of the restiform body,\r\nand turns outward behind the brachium pontis. The thick part which\r\nstretches over the posterior angle of the ventricle is termed the\r\n=obex=. The posterior part of the ventricle forms three recesses, of\r\nwhich two are lateral and the third median and posterior. The =lateral\r\nrecesses= communicate with the subarachnoid space by distinct openings\r\n(Aperturæ laterales). The layer of pia which strengthens the roof here\r\nis named the =tela chorioidea= of the fourth ventricle. It is triangular\r\nin outline and closely adherent to the velum. It forms three fringed\r\nmasses which contain vascular convolutions and are designated the\r\n=median= and =lateral chorioid plexuses= of the fourth ventricle. They\r\nappear to lie within the ventricle, but are really excluded from the\r\ncavity by the epithelial lining, which they invaginate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 505.—BRAIN STEM AND BASAL GANGLIA OF HORSE, RIGHT VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _F.a._, External arcuate fibers; _C.r._, corpus restiforme; _P_,\r\n    pyramid; _T_, corpus trapezoideum; _B.p._, middle peduncle of\r\n    cerebellum; _P.c._, cerebral peduncle; _S_, sulcus lateralis;\r\n    _T.t._, tractus transversus; _L._, trigonum lemnisci; _C.a._, corpus\r\n    quad, ant.; _C.p._, corpus quad, post.; _B_, commissure of _C.p._;\r\n    _G_, corpus geniculatum internum; _T.o._, olfactory peduncle;\r\n    _B.o._, olfactory bulb.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE MESENCEPHALON\r\n\r\nThe =mesencephalon= or =mid-brain= connects the rhombencephalon with the\r\nfore-brain. In the undissected brain it is covered dorsally by the\r\ncerebral hemispheres. It consists of a dorsal part, the corpora\r\nquadrigemina, and a larger ventral part, the cerebral peduncles, which\r\nare visible on the base of the brain. It is traversed longitudinally by\r\na narrow canal, the cerebral aqueduct, which connects the fourth\r\nventricle with the third.\r\n\r\nThe =corpora quadrigemina=[191] are four rounded eminences which lie\r\nunder the posterior part of the cerebral hemispheres. They consist of\r\ntwo pairs, separated by a transverse groove. The =anterior pair=\r\n(Colliculi nasales) are larger and much higher than the posterior pair.\r\nThey are gray in color, almost hemispherical, and are separated by a\r\nnarrow furrow which leads forward to the subpineal fovea. A wide groove\r\nintervenes between them and the optic thalami. The =posterior pair=\r\n(Colliculi caudales) are relatively small and are paler than the\r\nanterior pair. They are marked by a wide median depression, and are\r\nlimited below by a transverse furrow (Sulcus postquadrigeminus), at\r\neither side of which the =trochlear= (fourth) =nerve= emerges. Laterally\r\neach is prolonged to the inner geniculate body by a band of white matter\r\ntermed the inferior brachium.[192]\r\n\r\nThe =cerebral peduncles= or crura cerebri (Pedunculi cerebri) appear on\r\nthe base of the brain as two large rope-like stalks which emerge from\r\nthe pons close together and diverge as they extend forward to enter the\r\ncerebrum. At the point of disappearance the =optic tract= winds\r\nobliquely across the peduncle. About half an inch further back a small\r\ntract (Tractus peduncularis transversus) curves across the peduncles,\r\nand behind this near the median line is the superficial origin of the\r\n=oculomotor= (third) =nerve=. The triangular depression between the\r\ndiverging peduncles is the =interpeduncular space= (Fossa\r\ninterpeduncularis). It is covered to a large extent by the =pituitary\r\nbody=, a discoid brown mass which is connected with the base of the\r\nbrain by a hollow stalk, the =infundibulum=. The posterior part of the\r\nspace is pierced by numerous minute openings which transmit\r\nblood-vessels, and is therefore termed the =locus perforatus posticus=.\r\nThe objects in the space belong to the diencephalon, and will be\r\ndescribed later. The lateral aspect of the peduncle is marked by a\r\ngroove (Sulcus lateralis mesencephali) which indicates the division into\r\na dorsal part, the =tegmentum=, and a ventral part the =basis\r\npedunculi=; these are separated by a layer of dark gray matter, the\r\n=substantia nigra=. The triangular area (Trigonum lemnisci) above the\r\nlateral groove is faintly marked by fibers passing obliquely upward and\r\nbackward to the anterior cerebellar peduncle; these belong to the fillet\r\nor lemniscus, an important tract that connects the thalamus and corpora\r\nquadrigemina with the sensory reception nuclei of the opposite side of\r\nthe medulla.\r\n\r\nThe =aqueduct of the cerebrum= or of Sylvius (Aquæductus cerebri) is the\r\ncanal which extends through the mid-brain from the fourth to the third\r\nventricle. It is surrounded by a layer of gray matter (Stratum griseum\r\ncentrale), in the ventral part of which are the nuclei of origin of the\r\noculomotor and trochlear nerves, and laterally nuclei of the\r\nmesencephalic roots of the trigeminal nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE DIENCEPHALON\r\n\r\nThe =diencephalon= or =inter-brain= comprises the thalamus and a number\r\nof other structures grouped about the third ventricle, the cavity of\r\nthis division of the brain.[193] To expose its dorsal aspect, the\r\ngreater part of the cerebral hemispheres, the corpus callosum, the\r\nfornix, the hippocampus, and the tela chorioidea of the third ventricle\r\nmust be removed.\r\n\r\nThe =thalamus= (or optic thalamus) is the principal body in this part of\r\nthe brain. It is a large ovoid gray mass placed obliquely across the\r\ndorsal face of each cerebral peduncle, so that the long axes of the two\r\nthalami would meet in front about at a right angle. Medially they are\r\nfused to a large extent, and around the area of adhesion they are\r\nseparated by a sagittal circular space, the third ventricle. The dorsal\r\nsurface is convex in both directions, and is separated from the\r\noverlying hippocampus by the tela chorioidea (or velum interpositum).\r\nLaterally it is separated from the nucleus caudatus by an oblique groove\r\nin which there is a band of white matter termed the =stria terminalis=\r\nor tænia semicircularis. Internally it is bounded by a narrow band, the\r\n=stria medullaris=, on which is a delicate ridge of ependyma termed the\r\n=tænia thalami=. The striæ unite posteriorly and blend with the stalk of\r\nthe pituitary body. Near this point they present a small enlargement\r\ncaused by the nucleus habenulæ. Anteriorly there is a small eminence,\r\nthe =anterior tubercle=. The posterior part of the thalamus has the form\r\nof a rounded ridge which is continuous laterally with the optic\r\ntract.[194] Behind the point of origin of the tract, in the angle\r\nbetween the thalamus and the cerebral peduncle, is the =internal\r\ngeniculate body= (Corpus geniculatum mediale), a well defined oval\r\nprominence.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The outer surface is separated from the lenticular nucleus by the\r\n  =internal capsule=, an important mass of white matter composed of\r\n  fibers passing to and from the cerebral cortex. These fibers go to\r\n  form a large part of the ventral portion (basis) of the cerebral\r\n  peduncle. From the entire external surface of the thalamus fibers pass\r\n  into the internal capsule and radiate to reach the cerebral cortex;\r\n  similarly fibers coming from the cortex converge in the internal\r\n  capsule to enter the thalamus. This arrangement is termed the thalamic\r\n  radiation. Ventral to the thalamus proper is the =subthalamic\r\n  tegmental region=. This is the continuation of the tegmental part of\r\n  the cerebral peduncle into the diencephalon. It contains the =red\r\n  nucleus= (Nucleus ruber) an important ganglion on the course of the\r\n  motor tracts. It receives numerous fibers from the cerebral cortex and\r\n  the corpus striatum. From it fibers proceed to the thalamus and to the\r\n  spinal cord; the fibers to the cord (Tractus rubro-spinalis of\r\n  Monakow) cross to the opposite side and extend back in the tegmentum\r\n  to the lateral columns of the cord. Lateral to the red nucleus a\r\n  conspicuous lenticular area of dark gray matter is visible on\r\n  cross-sections of the subthalamic region; this is the =subthalamic\r\n  nucleus= (Nucleus hypothalamicus s. corpus Luysi), which consists of\r\n  pigmented nerve-cells scattered through a dense network of fine\r\n  medullated fibers, and is richly supplied with capillary\r\n  blood-vessels. The two nuclei are connected by a transverse commissure\r\n  (Commissura hypothalamica), which crosses the floor of the third\r\n  ventricle above the mammillary body.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =pineal body= or =epiphysis= is a small ovoid or fusiform red-brown\r\nmass situated in a deep central depression between the thalami and\r\ncorpora quadrigemina. It is variable in size, but is commonly about 10\r\nto 12 mm. long and 6 mm. wide. It is attached at the postero-superior\r\nquadrant of the third ventricle by a short stalk, in which is a small\r\nrecess of that cavity. Its base blends in front with the junction of the\r\nstriæ medullares of the thalamus. Immediately under the posterior part\r\nof the stalk is a short transverse band of white matter, the =posterior\r\ncommissure=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The pineal body is inclosed in a fibrous capsule from which numerous\r\n  trabeculæ pass inward, dividing the organ into spaces occupied by\r\n  round epithelial cells of the same origin as the ependyma of the\r\n  ventricle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =mammillary body= (Corpus mammillare) is a white round elevation a\r\nlittle larger than a pea which projects ventrally at the anterior end of\r\nthe median furrow of the interpeduncular space. While it is a single\r\nbody in external form in the horse, sections show that it is double in\r\nstructure and contains a nucleus of gray matter on either side.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Three sets of fibers are connected with the mammillary body. The\r\n  anterior pillar of the fornix curves down in the lateral wall of the\r\n  third ventricle to the body and many of the fornix fibers end in it. A\r\n  bundle (Fasciculus thalamo-mammillaris) passes upward and backward\r\n  from it into the anterior part of the thalamus, and a tract\r\n  (Fasciculus pedunculo-mammillaris) extends back in the floor of the\r\n  third ventricle to the tegmentum of the mid-brain.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =pituitary body= or =hypophysis= was mentioned as covering part of\r\nthe interpeduncular space. It is oval in outline, flattened\r\ndorso-ventrally, and nearly an inch (ca. 2 cm.) in width. It is attached\r\nby a delicate tubular stalk, the =infundibulum=, to the =tuber\r\ncinereum=, a small gray prominence situated between the optic chiasm in\r\nfront and the mammillary body behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The pituitary body consists of two parts which can be distinguished\r\n  readily on sections by their color. The glandular (or anterior) lobe\r\n  is brown in color and is inclosed in a fibrous capsule. It is\r\n  glandular in character and there is good ground for the view that it\r\n  is an organ of internal secretion. Besides the chief cells which stain\r\n  lightly, it contains large deeply staining chromophile cells. It\r\n  arises as an outgrowth from the primitive mouth cavity. The cerebral\r\n  (or posterior) lobe is pale and is connected with the infundibulum so\r\n  as to form a rather flask-shaped arrangement. It is almost entirely\r\n  inclosed by the glandular part. It arises as an outgrowth from the\r\n  primitive diencephalon, but loses most of its earlier nervous\r\n  character.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe optic chiasm and tracts form the anterior boundary of the\r\ninterpeduncular space. The =optic chiasm= or =commissure= (Chiasma\r\nopticum) is formed by the convergence of the optic nerves and the\r\ncrossing of the major part of the fibers of the nerve of one side to the\r\ntract of the opposite side. From the chiasm each =optic tract= (Tractus\r\nopticus) curves over the cerebral peduncle outward, backward, and upward\r\nto the posterior part of the thalamus and the internal geniculate body;\r\nsome fibers reach the anterior quadrigeminal body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 506.—CROSS-SECTION OF BRAIN OF HORSE, NATURAL SIZE.\r\n\r\n  Section passes through posterior part of third ventricle and is viewed\r\n    from behind. _1_, Longitudinal fissure; _2_, hippocampus; _2′_,\r\n    fimbria; _3_, septum pellucidum; _4_, lateral ventricle; _5_,\r\n    thalamus; _6_, habenula; _7_, third ventricle; _8_, cerebral\r\n    peduncle; _8′_, hypothalamus; _9_, mammillary body; _10_, pituitary\r\n    body; _11_, pyriform lobe; _12_, ventral end of hippocampus; _13_,\r\n    amygdaloid nucleus. Between the upper parts of the tæniæ thalami is\r\n    the chorioid plexus of the third ventricle, and above this are the\r\n    internal cerebral veins.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  All the fibers in the chiasm are not derived from the optic nerves.\r\n  The posterior part contains fibers which pass from one tract to the\r\n  other and are connected with the internal geniculate bodies; this\r\n  bundle is called Gudden’s commissure (Commissura inferior). Above it\r\n  is Meynert’s commissure (Commissura superior), the fibers of which\r\n  enter the subthalamic body.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =third ventricle= (Ventriculus tertius) is the narrow annular space\r\nbetween the thalami. It communicates by means of the aqueduct with the\r\nfourth ventricle behind, and in front it is continuous with the lateral\r\nventricle on each side through the interventricular foramen. Its floor\r\nis formed by the structures of the interpeduncular space and to a small\r\nextent by the tegmentum of the cerebral peduncles. The roof is formed in\r\nthe strict sense only by the ependyma, above which is a fold of pia\r\nmater, termed the =tela chorioidea= of the third ventricle or =velum\r\ninterpositum=. The roof is invaginated by two delicate =chorioid\r\nplexuses= which appear to lie within the ventricle, although they are\r\nexcluded from the cavity by the epithelium. When the tela is removed,\r\nthe delicate ependyma of the roof is torn away with it, leaving the line\r\nof attachment to the stria medullaris to constitute the tænia thalami.\r\nThe =anterior wall= is formed by the =lamina terminalis= (s. cinerea), a\r\nthin layer of gray matter which extends upward from the optic chiasm to\r\nthe corpus callosum. A distinct rounded band of white matter extends\r\nacross its posterior face, bulging into the ventricle. This is the\r\n=anterior commissure= (Commissura nasalis) of the cerebrum; its fibers\r\nextend to the olfactory bulb and to the pyriform lobe. A similar but\r\nmore slender =posterior commissure= (Commissura caudalis) crosses the\r\nposterior wall above the entrance to the aqueduct; the connections of\r\nits fibers are not yet clearly known. The =interventricular foramen= (of\r\nMonroe) is situated on either side of the anterior part of the ventricle\r\nand leads outward and slightly upward between the anterior pillar of the\r\nfornix and the anterior tubercle of the thalamus. The cavity presents\r\nthree =recesses= or diverticula, of which two are ventral and the third\r\nis supero-posterior. The =optic recess= (Recessus opticus) lies above\r\nthe optic chiasm. Just behind it is the =infundibular recess= (Recessus\r\ninfundibuli) which extends through the infundibulum to the pituitary\r\nbody. The =pineal recess= (Recessus pinealis) is in the stalk of the\r\npineal body.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE TELENCEPHALON\r\n\r\nThe =telencephalon= or =end-brain= comprises two principal parts, the\r\ncerebral hemispheres and the optic part of the hypothalamus. The latter\r\nhas been considered as a matter of convenience in the description of the\r\ndiencephalon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES\r\n\r\nThe =cerebral hemispheres= (Hemisphæria) form the greater part of the\r\nfully developed brain. Viewed from above (Fig. 498) they form an ovoid\r\nmass, of which the broader end is posterior, and the greatest transverse\r\ndiameter is a little behind the middle. The two hemispheres are\r\nseparated by a deep median cleft, the =longitudinal fissure= of the\r\ncerebrum, which is occupied by a sickle-shaped fold of dura mater, the\r\nfalx cerebri. In front the separation is complete, and it appears to be\r\nbehind also, but here the two hemispheres are attached to each other\r\nover a small area by the pia mater. When the hemispheres are gently\r\ndrawn apart, it is seen that the fissure is interrupted in its middle\r\npart at a depth of a little more than an inch (ca. 3 cm.) by a white\r\ncommissural mass, the =corpus callosum=; this connects the hemispheres\r\nfor about half of their length. The =transverse fissure= separates the\r\nhemispheres from the cerebellum, and contains the tentorium cerebelli.\r\n\r\nThe =convex= or =dorso-lateral surface=[195] conforms closely to the\r\ncranial wall. The =medial= or =internal surface= is flat and sagittal\r\nand bounds the longitudinal fissure; to a large extent it is in contact\r\nwith the falx cerebri, but behind the great cerebral vein the two\r\nhemispheres are in contact and are attached to each other over a small\r\narea as noted above. In well hardened specimens there is usually an\r\nimpression for the vein in front of the area of adhesion. The =base= or\r\n=ventral surface= (Fig. 499) is irregular. Its anterior two-thirds is\r\nadapted to the cerebral fossa of the cranial floor. Crossing this area\r\nin front of the optic tract is a depression, the =transverse fossa=\r\n(vallecula or fossa of Sylvius), which leads outward to the =lateral\r\nfissure= (fissure of Sylvius), and lodges the middle cerebral artery. In\r\nfront of the fossa there is a considerable rounded elevation known as\r\nthe =trigonum olfactorium=. The trigonum and the inner part of the fossa\r\nare pierced by numerous openings for the passage of small blood-vessels\r\nand are equivalent to the locus perforatus anticus of man. Behind the\r\nouter part of the fossa is the rounded anterior end of the =pyriform\r\nlobe=. Traced backward the lobe curves upward and inward over the optic\r\ntract and the thalamus to the tentorial aspect of the hemisphere; its\r\ncontinuation, the hippocampus, forms part of the floor of the lateral\r\nventricle, and will be examined later.\r\n\r\nThe posterior part or =tentorial area= is flattened, faces inward and\r\nbackward as well as downward, and rests largely on the tentorium\r\ncerebelli; on its anterior part there is a shallow depression adapted to\r\nthe corpora quadrigemina and the pineal body.\r\n\r\nThe =frontal pole= or anterior extremity (exclusive of the olfactory\r\nbulb) is compressed laterally, and the =occipital pole= or posterior\r\nextremity forms a blunt point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 507.—LEFT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE OF HORSE, LATERAL VIEW. THE\r\n    OLFACTORY BULB IS CUT OFF.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Lateral fissure (of Sylvius); _2_, _3_, _4_, middle, posterior,\r\n    and anterior branches of _1_; _5_, presylvian fissure; _6_, _6′_,\r\n    sulcus rhinalis, anterior et posterior; _7_, suprasylvian fissure;\r\n    _8_, ectomarginal fissure; _9_, _9′_, ectosylvian fissure.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe hemisphere comprises: (1) the =pallium= or =mantle=, which consists\r\nof an outer layer of gray matter, the =cortex= (Substantia corticalis),\r\ncovering a large mass of white matter (Centrum semiovale); (2) the\r\n=rhinencephalon= or olfactory portion of the brain; (3) the =corpus\r\ncallosum= and =fornix=, the great commissural white masses; (4) the\r\n=lateral ventricle= and certain important structures associated\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nThe =pallium= is thrown into numerous folds, the =gyri cerebri=, which\r\nare separated by =sulci= or =fissures= of varying depth. The general\r\npattern of the gyri and sulci is similar in normal brains of the same\r\nspecies, but the details are very variable and are never alike on the\r\ntwo hemispheres of the same brain. In the horse the arrangement is\r\ncomplicated by the existence of numerous short accessory fissures which\r\ncut into the gyri at right angles and tend to confuse the observer. The\r\nprincipal fissures and sulci of the convex surface (Figs. 497, 507) are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =lateral fissure= (Fissura lateralis Sylvii) ascends on the\r\nlateral surface of the hemisphere as the continuation of the fossa\r\ntransversa in front of the pyriform lobe. After crossing the external\r\nolfactory tract it divides into three branches; of these one passes\r\nupward, one runs obliquely forward and upward, and the third is directed\r\nupward and backward.\r\n\r\n2. The =suprasylvian fissure= (F. suprasylvia)[196] is long and divides\r\na large part of the convex surface of the hemisphere into dorsal and\r\nlateral portions. It begins on the dorso-medial border near its anterior\r\nend and, inclining gradually downward, passes back to end on reaching\r\nthe tentorial surface. It is continuous internally with the transverse\r\nfissure usually and in front with the presylvian fissure.\r\n\r\n3. The =presylvian fissure= (F. præsylvia) is the continuation forward\r\nof the preceding. It passes forward, outward, and downward almost to the\r\nfrontal pole, and then inclines backward to end at the groove which\r\nmarks the upper limit of the rhinencephalon (Sulcus rhinalis).\r\n\r\n4. The =marginal fissure= (F. marginalis) extends along the dorso-medial\r\nborder. It begins a little in front of the middle of the border and\r\nturns around the occipital pole to end on its tentorial aspect.\r\n\r\n5. The =entomarginal fissure= (F. entomarginalis) lies internal to the\r\ndorso-medial border. It does not extend quite as far forward as the\r\nmarginal fissure, from which it is separated by a narrow gyrus.\r\n\r\n6. The =ectomarginal fissure= (F. ectomarginalis) lies about midway\r\nbetween the marginal fissure and the posterior part of the suprasylvian\r\nfissure.\r\n\r\n7. The =sulcus rhinalis= is a very distinct furrow on the lower part of\r\nthe lateral surface which marks off the olfactory part of the brain\r\n(rhinencephalon) from the rest of the hemisphere. It is undulating and\r\nis highest where it is crossed by the lateral fissure (of Sylvius).[197]\r\n\r\nOn the medial surface (Fig. 508) the main fissures and sulci are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. The =calloso-marginal fissure= (F. calloso-marginalis) is extensive\r\nand well defined. It is approximately parallel to the dorso-medial\r\nborder of the hemisphere, from which it is about half an inch distant.\r\nIt begins in front a short distance below and in front of the anterior\r\nbend (genu) of the corpus callosum and forms a =C=-shaped curve, its\r\nposterior part extending on the tentorial surface to a point behind the\r\ndepression for the corpora quadrigemina. It separates the marginal gyri\r\nabove from the gyrus fornicatus, which extends down to the corpus\r\ncallosum.\r\n\r\n2. The =transverse fissure= (F. transversa) begins a little behind the\r\nmiddle of the calloso-marginal fissure, passes obliquely upward and\r\nforward to the dorso-medial border—into which it cuts deeply—and usually\r\njoins the suprasylvian fissure.[198]\r\n\r\n3. The =sublimbic fissure= (F. sublimbica) curves over the gyrus\r\nfornicatus a short distance above the corpus callosum. Its middle part\r\nis commonly indistinct, and it is often divided into anterior and\r\nposterior parts.\r\n\r\n4. The =callosal sulcus= (Sulcus corporis callosi) separates the corpus\r\ncallosum from the gyrus fornicatus.\r\n\r\nThe =hippocampus= (or cornu Ammonis) is a gyrus which curves from the\r\ndeep face of the pyriform lobe around the thalamus and forms the\r\nposterior part of the floor of the lateral ventricle. It can be\r\ndisplayed by cutting away the brain stem up to the optic tract and the\r\ninterventricular foramen. Viewed from below the hippocampal gyrus is\r\nseen to form a semicircular curve from the apex of the pyriform lobe to\r\nthe angle of divergence of the posterior pillars of the fornix, _i. e._,\r\nto a point under the central part of the corpus callosum. It is\r\nseparated deeply by the hippocampal fissure from the =gyrus dentatus=.\r\nAlong the concave margin of the latter is a band of white matter, termed\r\nthe =fimbria=, which is the prolongation of the greater part of the\r\nposterior pillar of the fornix into this region. The ventricular surface\r\nof the hippocampus (Fig. 511) is covered with a thin layer of white\r\nmatter, the =alveus=, which is also derived from the posterior pillar of\r\nthe fornix, and is therefore continuous with the fimbria. The two\r\nhippocampi are connected at their highest parts by transverse fibers\r\nwhich constitute the =hippocampal commissure=.\r\n\r\nThe interval between the hippocampus and fimbria on the one hand and the\r\nbrain stem on the other is a lateral continuation of the great\r\ntransverse fissure of the brain, and is termed the =chorioid fissure=.\r\nIt is occupied by a fold of pia mater, the =tela chorioidea= of the\r\nthird ventricle, or =velum interpositum=. This fold is triangular in\r\noutline and its apex reaches to the interventricular foramen. Its base\r\nis continuous at the transverse fissure with the pia which covers the\r\nsurface of the brain. Its middle part lies over the epithelial roof of\r\nthe third ventricle, as has been seen (Fig. 506). The lateral borders\r\nwill be seen on the floor of the lateral ventricles, where they form\r\nthick rounded bands containing convolutions of blood-vessels, known as\r\nthe =chorioid plexuses= of the lateral ventricles (Fig. 511).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 508.—MEDIAN SECTION OF BRAIN OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The membranes and vessels are removed. _C_, Central white matter\r\n    (corpus medullare) of cerebellum; _P.c._, cerebral peduncle; _C.q._,\r\n    corpora quadrigemina; _P_, pineal body; _Th._, thalamus; _V.III._,\r\n    third ventricle; _r_, optic recess; _r′_, infundibular recess;\r\n    _C.m._, mammillary body; _s_, subcallosal gyrus; _A.p._, area\r\n    parolfactoria; _G_, genu of corpus callosum; _S_, splenium of same;\r\n    _1_, callosal sulcus; _2_, interventricular foramen; _3_, olfactory\r\n    bulb. The cerebral lobe of the pituitary body is distinguished by\r\n    its lighter color.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the tela is pulled out one may easily get the impression that the\r\n  lateral ventricle communicates with the exterior by means of the\r\n  chorioid fissure. Such is not the case, since the chorioid plexus is\r\n  covered by the epithelial lining of the ventricle, which has been torn\r\n  away.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =rhinencephalon= or olfactory part of the brain comprises the\r\nolfactory bulb, peduncle and tracts or roots, the trigonum olfactorium,\r\nthe area parolfactoria, and the pyriform lobe.[199]\r\n\r\nThe =olfactory bulb= (Bulbus olfactorius) is an oval enlargement which\r\ncurves upward in front of the frontal pole of the hemisphere. Its convex\r\nsuperficial face fits into the ethmoidal fossa and receives numerous\r\nolfactory nerve-fibers through the cribriform plate; hence it is very\r\ndifficult to remove the bulb intact. It contains a considerable =cavity=\r\n(Ventriculus bulbi olfactorii) which is connected with the lateral\r\nventricle by a small canal in the middle olfactory tract. The deep face\r\nis largely in contact with the frontal pole of the hemisphere and is\r\nconnected with the olfactory peduncle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The gray matter of the bulb is external and is thickest on the convex\r\n  anterior surface. The posterior surface consists to a large extent of\r\n  fibers which are the axones of the mitral cells of the deep layer of\r\n  the gray substance and go to form the peduncle and striæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =olfactory peduncle= (Tractus olfactorius) is a very short but wide\r\nband of white substance which arises in the olfactory bulb and extends\r\nback to be continued by the olfactory tracts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 509.—MEDIO-VENTRAL ASPECT OF RIGHT CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The olfactory bulb is cut off. _T.ol._, Olfactory peduncle; _A.p._,\r\n    area parolfactoria; _Tr.O._, trigonum olfactorium; _T.op._, optic\r\n    tract; _C.o._, chiasma opticum; _G.s._, subcallosal gyrus; _C.c._,\r\n    corpus callosum; _S.p._, septum pellucidum; _F_, fornix; _G.c._,\r\n    callosal gyrus; _T_, cut surface of thalamus; _F′_, fimbria; _G.d._,\r\n    gyrus dentatus; _L.p._, pyriform lobe; _G.h._, hippocampal gyrus.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =olfactory tracts= or =striæ= (Striæ olfactorii) are three in\r\nnumber. The =external tract= (Stria lateralis) is much the largest and\r\nmost distinct. It passes backward, upward, and outward, widens out and\r\njoins the pyriform lobe. It is clearly defined dorsally by the sulcus\r\nrhinalis and is marked off from the trigonum olfactorium by the sulcus\r\narcuatus. The =intermediate tract= (Stria intermedia) is short, ill\r\ndefined, and flat; it contains the canal which opens into the anterior\r\nhorn of the lateral ventricle. The =internal tract= (Stria medialis) is\r\nsmall, short, and not well defined; it bends over to the parolfactory\r\narea (of Broca) on the inner face of the hemisphere below the genu of\r\nthe corpus callosum.\r\n\r\nThe =trigonum olfactorium= is the prominent gray area situated in the\r\nangle of divergence of the internal and external olfactory striæ. It is\r\nbounded externally by the external olfactory stria, from which it is\r\ndefined by the arcuate sulcus. It is continuous with the =area\r\nparolfactoria= on the medial surface; behind the latter a band descends\r\nfrom the rostrum of the corpus callosum and is continuous below with the\r\nanterior perforated space; it is termed the =subcallosal gyrus= or\r\npeduncle of the corpus callosum.\r\n\r\nThe =pyriform lobe= (Lobus piriformis) is the well-marked prominence on\r\nthe base lateral to the optic tract and cerebral peduncle, from which it\r\nis separated by a deep fissure. Its nipple-like apex lies behind the\r\nfossa transversa and covers the optic tract. The external surface is\r\nmarked by one or two sulci (lobi piriformis). The lobe contains a\r\ncavity, the ventral horn of the lateral ventricle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fibers of the olfactory tracts go to the pyriform lobe and\r\n  hippocampus, the trigonum olfactorium, the area parolfactoria, the\r\n  subcallosal gyrus, and part of the gyrus fornicatus. The central\r\n  connections of the olfactory apparatus are complex and are not yet\r\n  fully understood. The anterior cerebral commissure contains fibers\r\n  which pass from the olfactory bulb of one side by way of the inner\r\n  tracts to the bulb of the opposite side; also fibers which cross in it\r\n  from the inner tract of one side to the pyriform lobe of the opposite\r\n  side. Many fibers pass by way of the septum pellucidum, fornix, and\r\n  fimbria to the hippocampus. Other fibers pass in the anterior pillar\r\n  of the fornix to the mammillary body and thence to the thalamus by the\r\n  thalamo-mammillary bundle.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 510.—LATERAL VIEW OF CAST OF CAVITIES OF BRAIN OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _Bo_, Cavity of olfactory, which communicates through the canal _I_\r\n    with a lateral ventricle; _Ca_, anterior horn, _Cm_, body, _Ci_,\r\n    ventral horn of lateral ventricle; _M_, isthmus which connects\r\n    lateral and third ventricles _Ep_, suprapineal recess, below which\r\n    is the small infrapineal recess; _Ro_, optic recess; _Rh_,\r\n    infundibular and pituitary recess; _S_, aqueduct; _Fl_, ridge\r\n    corresponding to sulcus limitans; _Rl_, lateral recess, _Rm_,\r\n    posterior recess, of fourth ventricle; _Cc_, beginning of central\r\n    canal of spinal cord. (Dexler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =corpus callosum= is the great transverse commissure which connects\r\nthe two cerebral hemispheres through about half of their length. On\r\nmedian section (Fig. 508) it is seen to be arched from before backward,\r\nwhite in color, and composed substantially of transverse fibers. The\r\nmiddle part or =truncus= (Truncus corporis callosi) slopes downward and\r\nforward and is thinner than the ends. The anterior thickened end, the\r\n=genu=, bends downward and backward and thins out to form the =rostrum=;\r\nthe latter is continuous with the lamina terminalis. The posterior end,\r\nthe =splenium=, also thick, lies at a considerably higher level than the\r\ngenu. The =upper surface= is convex in its length, concave transversely.\r\nIts central part forms the floor of the longitudinal fissure. It is\r\ncovered by a thin layer of gray matter (Induseum griseum), in which are\r\nstrands of longitudinal fibers (Striæ longitudinales); the latter are\r\narranged in median and lateral bundles (Stria medialis, striæ\r\nlaterales).[200] The =lower surface= has the reverse configuration, and\r\nforms the roof of the lateral ventricles. Along the median line the\r\nseptum pellucidum is attached to it. The fibers of the corpus callosum\r\n(with the exception of the longitudinal striæ) run transversely and\r\nspread out laterally in all directions in the central white matter of\r\nthe hemispheres to the cortex, forming the =radiation of the corpus\r\ncallosum= (Radiatio corporis callosi).\r\n\r\nThe =fornix= is a bilateral structure composed of white fibers which\r\narch chiefly over the thalamus and the third ventricle. It is described\r\nas consisting of a body and two pairs of pillars. The =body= (Corpus\r\nfornicis) is formed by the fusion of the two arches of which the fornix\r\nis composed. It is triangular and overlies the anterior parts of the\r\nthalami and the third ventricle. The upper surface gives attachment to\r\nthe septum pellucidum and on either side forms part of the floor of the\r\nlateral ventricle. The lateral border is related to the chorioid plexus\r\nof the lateral ventricle and forms the inner boundary of the\r\ninterventricular foramen. The =anterior pillars= or =columns= (Columnæ\r\nfornicis) (Fig. 512) are two slender round bundles which emerge from the\r\nbody in front of the interventricular foramen and diverge slightly as\r\nthey curve downward and backward to the mammillary body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 511.—BRAIN OF HORSE, WITH LATERAL VENTRICLES OPENED BY REMOVAL OF\r\n    UPPER PART OF CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  From the mammillary body the greater part of these fornix fibers are\r\n  continued to the thalamus by the thalamo-mammillary fasciculus (or\r\n  bundle of Vicq d’Azyr). Others pass to the cerebral peduncle. A\r\n  portion of the fibers cross to the opposite thalamus and cerebral\r\n  peduncle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =posterior pillars= (Crura fornicis) are much larger bands which\r\ndiverge widely from the posterior angles of the body. Each curves\r\noutward and backward over the thalamus (from which it is separated by\r\nthe tela chorioidea) and is chiefly continued as the =fimbria= along the\r\nconcave border of the hippocampus. The pillars give off fibers to form\r\nthe alveus or white matter which covers the ventricular face of the\r\nhippocampi, and between them are transverse fibers which constitute the\r\nhippocampal commissure.\r\n\r\nThe =septum pellucidum= is the median partition between the two lateral\r\nventricles. Its convex upper border blends with the corpus callosum and\r\nits concave lower border joins the fornix. Its anterior part is received\r\ninto the genu of the corpus callosum. Traced backward it diminishes in\r\nheight and the two edges meet at an acute angle at the splenium.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The septum consists of two layers (Laminæ septi pellucidi) which are\r\n  in direct contact with each other. They consist of nerve-fibers and\r\n  gray matter. The latter exists in considerable amount in the thicker\r\n  part of the septum adjacent to the anterior pillars of the fornix.\r\n  Many of the fibers of the septum pass up through the corpus callosum\r\n  to the gyrus fornicatus. Others are connected with the subcallosal\r\n  gyrus and the parolfactory area.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 512.—CROSS-SECTION OF BRAIN OF HORSE, ABOUT NATURAL SIZE.\r\n\r\n  Section passes through chiasma opticum, and is viewed from in front.\r\n    _1_, Longitudinal fissure; _2_, septum pellucidum; _3_, columns\r\n    (anterior pillars) of fornix; _4_, lateral ventricle; _5_, chorioid\r\n    plexus; _6_, corpus medullare (central white matter) of hemisphere;\r\n    _7_, caudate nucleus; _8_, lenticular nucleus; _9_, internal\r\n    capsule; _10_, external capsule; _11_, insula.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lateral ventricle= (Ventriculus lateralis) is the irregular cavity\r\nin the interior of each cerebral hemisphere.[201] Each communicates with\r\nthe third ventricle through the =interventricular foramen= (of Monro),\r\nand by a small canal with the cavity of the olfactory bulb. It is usual\r\nto describe the ventricle as consisting of three parts, viz., the\r\ncentral part or body, and anterior and inferior horns. The =anterior\r\nhorn= (Cornu nasale) is the part in front of the interventricular\r\nforamen; it communicates ventrally with the olfactory cavity. The\r\n=central part= (Pars centralis) extends back to the splenium of the\r\ncorpus callosum. It opens into the third ventricle through the\r\ninterventricular foramen, which is situated between the fornix and the\r\nanterior part of the thalamus. The =inferior horn= (Cornu ventrale)\r\ncurves downward and forward into the pyriform lobe. The roof of the\r\nventricle is formed by the corpus callosum and the inner wall is the\r\nseptum pellucidum. After removal of the roof the floor is seen to be\r\nformed chiefly by two bodies. The anterior one is the =caudate nucleus=\r\n(Nucleus caudatus), a somewhat pear-shaped gray eminence, the long axis\r\nof which is directed obliquely upward, backward, and outward. Its\r\nanterior large end is termed the head, and the posterior long tapering\r\nend the tail. The posterior body, the =hippocampus=, is white on its\r\nventricular surface, which is strongly convex. It curves outward and\r\nbackward and then turns downward and forward to join the pyriform lobe.\r\nThe two bodies are separated by an oblique groove which is occupied by\r\nthe =chorioid plexus= of the lateral ventricle. This is the thickened\r\nedge of a fold of pia mater, the tela chorioidea (or velum\r\ninterpositum), which lies between the hippocampus and the thalamus. It\r\ncontains convolutions of small blood-vessels and in old subjects there\r\nmay be calcareous concretions in it. The plexuses of the two sides are\r\ncontinuous through the interventricular foramen. On drawing the chorioid\r\nplexus backward a narrow white band, the =stria terminalis= (or tænia\r\nsemicircularis), is seen along the margin of the caudate nucleus, where\r\nit bounds the intermediate groove. The plexus partially covers a wider\r\nwhite band which is blended with the white substance of the hippocampus;\r\nthis is the =posterior pillar of the fornix= and its continuation, the\r\n=fimbria=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 513.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF BRAIN OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  Section is cut about 1.5 cm. to the right of the median plane. _M_,\r\n    Medulla oblongata; _P_, pons; _P.c._ (above _M_), chorioid plexus of\r\n    fourth ventricle; _C.m._, central white matter (corpus medullare) of\r\n    cerebellum and of cerebrum; _P.c._ (in front of _P_), cerebral\r\n    peduncle; _H_, hippocampus; _V_, lateral ventricle; _T_, thalamus;\r\n    _N.c._, caudate nucleus; _C.i._, internal capsule; _N.l._,\r\n    lenticular nucleus; _B.o._, olfactory bulb.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =corpus striatum=[202] is the great basal ganglion of the\r\nhemisphere. It is situated in front of the thalamus and the cerebral\r\npeduncle, and its anterior rounded end appears on the base of the\r\nhemisphere at the trigonum olfactorium. It is composed of two masses of\r\ngray matter, the caudate and lenticular nuclei, separated incompletely\r\nby tracts of white matter which are known collectively as the internal\r\ncapsule. The =caudate nucleus= (Nucleus caudatus) is the dorso-medial\r\nand larger of the two gray masses; it has been seen in the examination\r\nof the floor of the lateral ventricle. The =lenticular nucleus= (Nucleus\r\nlentiformis) lies ventro-laterally, over the trigonum olfactorium and\r\nthe fossa transversa. It is related externally to a layer of white\r\nmatter termed the =external capsule=, which separates it from a stratum\r\nof gray substance known as the =claustrum=. The two nuclei are fused in\r\nfront, and further back they are connected by strands of gray matter\r\nwhich intersect the internal capsule.\r\n\r\nThe =amygdaloid nucleus= (Nucleus amygdalæ) (Fig. 506) is an ovoid mass\r\nof gray matter situated external to the ventral horn of the lateral\r\nventricle and below the posterior part of the lenticular nucleus. Some\r\nfibers of the stria terminalis are connected with it.\r\n\r\nThe =internal capsule= (Capsula interna) is a broad band of white matter\r\nsituated between the thalamus and caudate nucleus internally and the\r\nlenticular nucleus externally. A sagittal section through the brain\r\nshows that it is in great part directly continuous with the basis or\r\nventral part of the cerebral peduncle. It contains most of the so-called\r\n=projection fibers= of the hemisphere, which connect the cerebral cortex\r\nwith nuclei of other and more posterior parts of the brain. When the\r\nfibers of the internal capsule are traced forward it is evident that\r\nthey spread out in all directions to reach the cerebral cortex. This\r\narrangement, in which the fibers of the corpus callosum participate, is\r\ntermed the =corona radiata=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The internal capsule also contains fibers which connect the corpus\r\n  striatum with the thalamus. These are termed the thalamo-striate and\r\n  strio-thalamic fibers respectively, according to the direction in\r\n  which they conduct impulses.\r\n\r\n  The fibers of the stria terminalis connect the amygdaloid nucleus with\r\n  the septum pellucidum and trigonum olfactorium. It is therefore\r\n  probably part of the complex connections between the primary and\r\n  secondary olfactory centers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE CRANIAL NERVES\r\n\r\nThe =cranial= or =cerebral nerves= (Nn. cerebrales) comprise twelve\r\npairs which are designated from before backward numerically and by name.\r\nTheir number, names, and functional characters are given in the\r\nsubjoined table:\r\n\r\n       I.

Hypoglossal            Motor\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE FIRST OR OLFACTORY NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =olfactory nerve= (N. olfactorius) is peculiar in that its fibers\r\nare not aggregated to form a trunk, but are connected in small bundles\r\nwith the olfactory bulb. They are non-medullated, and are the central\r\nprocesses of the olfactory cells which are situated in the olfactory\r\nregion of the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity. This region is\r\ndistinguished by its brown color and comprises most of the lateral mass\r\nof the ethmoid, a small adjacent area of the superior turbinal, and the\r\ncorresponding surface of the septum nasi. The nerve-bundles are inclosed\r\nin sheaths derived from the membranes of the brain and pass through the\r\nforamina of the cribriform plate to join the convex surface of the\r\nolfactory bulb. Some fibers come from the vomero-nasal organ of\r\nJacobson.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE SECOND OR OPTIC NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =optic nerve= (N. opticus) is composed of fibers which are the\r\ncentral processes of the ganglion cells of the retina. The fibers\r\nconverge within the eyeball to the optic papilla, where they are\r\ncollected into a round trunk, the optic nerve. The nerve thus formed\r\npierces the chorioid and sclera, emerges from the posterior part of the\r\neyeball, and passes backward and inward to the optic foramen. After\r\ntraversing the latter it decussates with its fellow of the opposite side\r\nto form the optic chiasma or commissure. In the orbit the nerve is\r\nslightly flexuous and is embedded in the fat behind the eyeball and\r\nsurrounded by the retractor oculi muscle. Its intraosseous part is an\r\ninch or more (ca. 3 cm.) long. The =sheath= of the nerve is formed by\r\nprolongations of the membranes of the brain, and includes continuations\r\nof the subdural and subarachnoid spaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The greater part of the fibers of the optic nerve cross in the chiasma\r\n  to the tract of the opposite side. In the tract the fibers proceed to\r\n  (1) the internal geniculate body, (2) the posterior part of the\r\n  thalamus, and (3) the anterior quadrigeminal body (indirectly). The\r\n  fibers which go to the internal geniculate body appear to belong to\r\n  Gudden’s commissure and to be nonvisual in function. The visual\r\n  fibers, which come from the outer part of the retina of the same side\r\n  and the inner part of the retina of the opposite side, terminate about\r\n  cells in the anterior quadrigeminal body and the part of the thalamus\r\n  which corresponds to the pulvinar and external geniculate body of man.\r\n  From the cells of the former fibers pass to the nuclei of the motor\r\n  nerves of the eyeball, and complete the reflex arc. Fibers proceed\r\n  from the cells of the thalamus to the visual area of the cortex in the\r\n  occipital part of the hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE THIRD OR OCULOMOTOR NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =oculomotor nerve= (N. oculomotorius) arises by several radicles\r\nfrom the basal surface of the cerebral peduncle, a little lateral to the\r\ninterpeduncular furrow. It turns sharply outward and forward, crosses\r\nover the cavernous sinus, and continues above the maxillary nerve and in\r\ncompany with the ophthalmic nerve to the foramen lacerum orbitale. It\r\nemerges through the foramen with the latter nerve and the abducens and\r\ndivides into two branches. The =superior branch= is short and divides\r\ninto twigs which supply the rectus superior, retractor, and levator\r\npalpebræ superioris. The =inferior branch= (Figs. 438, 439) is larger\r\nand much longer. It supplies the motor fibers to the ciliary ganglion\r\n(which lies directly on this branch in the horse) and short branches to\r\nthe rectus internus and rectus inferior, and continues forward on the\r\nlatter to end in the inferior oblique muscle.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The deep origin of the fibers of the oculomotor nerve is in the\r\n  oculomotor nucleus situated in the gray matter of the floor of the\r\n  cerebral aqueduct in the region of the anterior corpora quadrigemina.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE FOURTH OR TROCHLEAR NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =trochlear= or pathetic (N. trochlearis) is the smallest of the\r\ncranial nerves. It arises from the anterior cerebellar peduncle just\r\nbehind the corpora quadrigemina, curves outward and forward, pierces the\r\ntentorium cerebelli, and passes forward along the outer border of the\r\nmaxillary nerve (Figs. 504, 505). It emerges from the cranium through a\r\nsmall foramen immediately above the foramen lacerum orbitale or through\r\nthe latter and passes forward along the inner wall of the orbit to end\r\nin the posterior part of the superior oblique muscle of the eyeball\r\n(Fig. 439).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fibers of the fourth nerve spring from a nucleus in the gray\r\n  matter of the floor of the cerebral aqueduct behind the oculomotor\r\n  nucleus. The fibers run backward in the tegmentum, then turn upward\r\n  and inward and undergo total decussation with those of the opposite\r\n  nerve in the anterior part of the anterior medullary velum. In\r\n  addition to this peculiarity it is the only nerve which is connected\r\n  with the dorsal aspect of the brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n               THE FIFTH, TRIGEMINAL, OR TRIFACIAL NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =trigeminal nerve= (N. trigeminus) is the largest of the cranial\r\nseries. It is connected with the lateral part of the pons by a large\r\n=sensory root= and a smaller =motor root= (Fig. 499).\r\n\r\nThe =sensory root= (Portio major) extends forward through a notch on the\r\nlower part of the petrosal crest and widens out to join the semilunar\r\nganglion.\r\n\r\nThe =semilunar= (or Gasserian) =ganglion= (Ganglion semilunare) is a\r\ncrescent-shaped mass of nerve-fibers and cells which overlies the\r\nantero-external part of the foramen lacerum basis cranii, and is partly\r\nembedded in the dense fibrous tissue which occupies the foramen except\r\nwhere vessels and nerves pass through. Its long axis, which is about an\r\ninch (2.5 cm.) in length, is directed forward and inward and its convex\r\nanterior face gives rise to the ophthalmic, the maxillary, and the\r\nsensory part of the mandibular division of the nerve. The surface of the\r\nganglion is irregularly striated. It is connected by filaments with the\r\nadjacent carotid plexus of the sympathetic, and sends delicate twigs to\r\nthe dura mater.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fibers of the sensory root arise from the ganglion as axones of\r\n  the ganglion cells, and the fibers of the nerves which extend\r\n  peripherally from the ganglion are dendrites of the cells. The sensory\r\n  root-fibers enter the tegmentum of the pons and divide into anterior\r\n  and posterior branches, which terminate about the cells of the sensory\r\n  nucleus of termination of the trigeminus. This nucleus extends from\r\n  the pons to the sixth cervical segment of the spinal cord (Dexler).\r\n  The posterior branches of the fibers are collected into a compact\r\n  bundle, the spinal tract or root of the trigeminus, which lies lateral\r\n  to the substantia gelatinosa in the medulla. The central connections\r\n  of the sensory part of the trigeminus are very extensive. The most\r\n  important paths are: (1) Axones of cells of the sensory nucleus and\r\n  the substantia gelatinosa pass chiefly as arcuate fibers across the\r\n  raphé to the thalamus, whence impulses are transmitted by\r\n  thalamo-cortical fibers to the cerebral cortex. In ungulates a\r\n  distinct tract extends from the anterior part of the sensory nucleus\r\n  to the thalamus of the same side (Wallenberg). It is probable that\r\n  collaterals of the arcuate fibers go to the motor nuclei of the fifth,\r\n  seventh, ninth, and tenth cranial nerves. (2) Axones of cells of the\r\n  sensory nucleus enter the posterior cerebellar peduncle of the same\r\n  side and reach the cerebellar cortex. (3) Collaterals are distributed\r\n  to the nuclei of origin of the hypoglossal and of the motor part of\r\n  the trigeminal and facial nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =motor root= (Portio minor) extends forward beneath the sensory root\r\nand the semilunar ganglion and is incorporated with the mandibular\r\ndivision of the nerve. Its fibers arise chiefly from the so-called\r\nmasticatory nucleus, which is situated in the pons near the inner face\r\nof the sensory nucleus; a few of these fibers come from the nucleus of\r\nthe opposite side and cross in the raphé. Other fibers, which constitute\r\nthe mesencephalic root, arise from cells in the outer part of the\r\ncentral gray matter of the mid-brain.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the foregoing statements that the trigeminus has\r\nessentially the same arrangement as a typical spinal nerve. It divides\r\ninto three branches.\r\n\r\nI. The =ophthalmic nerve= (N. ophthalmicus) (Figs. 438, 439, 440) is\r\npurely sensory and is the smallest of the three branches of the\r\ntrigeminus. It arises from the inner part of the front of the semilunar\r\nganglion, passes forward along the outer side of the cavernous sinus,\r\nand is blended with the maxillary nerve for some distance. It enters the\r\nforamen lacerum orbitale with the third and sixth nerves and divides\r\ninto three branches.\r\n\r\n1. The =lacrimal nerve= (N. lacrimalis) runs forward on the rectus\r\nsuperior and the levator palpebræ superioris and ramifies chiefly in\r\nthe lacrimal gland and the upper eyelid. A branch (Ramus\r\nzygomatico-temporalis) exchanges twigs with the zygomatic branch of\r\nthe maxillary nerve, perforates the periorbita, and emerges from the\r\norbital fossa behind the supraorbital process; it forms a plexus with\r\nbranches of the auriculo-palpebral and frontal nerves, and ramifies in\r\nthe skin of the temporal region.\r\n\r\n2. The =frontal nerve= (N. frontalis), also termed the supraorbital,\r\nruns forward almost parallel with the superior oblique muscle, at first\r\nwithin, then outside of, the periorbita. It passes through the\r\nsupraorbital foramen with the artery of like name and ramifies in the\r\nskin of the forehead and upper eyelid, forming a plexus with the\r\nlacrimal and auriculo-palpebral nerves. It divides into three branches.\r\n\r\n3. The =naso-ciliary nerve= (N. naso-ciliaris), also termed the\r\npalpebro-nasal, runs forward along the inner side of the optic nerve\r\nbetween parts of the retractor muscle and divides into two branches. Of\r\nthese the =ethmoidal nerve= (N. ethmoidalis) is the continuation of the\r\nparent trunk. It accompanies the ethmoidal artery through the foramen of\r\nlike name into the cranial cavity and crosses the lower part of the\r\nethmoidal fossa. Leaving the cranium through an opening in the\r\ncribriform plate close to the crista galli, it enters the nasal cavity\r\nand ramifies in the mucous membrane of the septum nasi and the superior\r\nturbinal. The =infratrochlear nerve= (N. infratrochlearis) runs forward\r\nto the inner canthus and ramifies in the skin in this region; it\r\ndetaches twigs to the conjunctiva and caruncula lacrimalis, and a long\r\nbranch which supplies the third eyelid and the lacrimal ducts and sac.\r\nThe naso-ciliary nerve furnishes the =sensory= or =long root= (Radix\r\nlonga) of the ciliary ganglion.\r\n\r\nThe =ciliary ganglion= is placed on the inferior branch of the\r\noculomotor nerve. It is usually not larger than a millet-seed, and is\r\nbest found by following the nerve to the inferior oblique muscle back to\r\nits origin. The ganglion receives (_a_) =sensory fibers= from the\r\nnaso-ciliary nerve; (_b_) =motor fibers= from the oculomotor nerve; and\r\n(_c_) =sympathetic fibers= from the sphenopalatine plexus. It detaches\r\nfilaments which unite with twigs from the ophthalmic and maxillary\r\nnerves and from the sphenopalatine ganglion to form the ciliary plexus.\r\nFrom the latter emanate five to eight delicate =short ciliary nerves=\r\n(Nn. ciliares breves), which pursue a somewhat flexuous course along the\r\noptic nerve, pierce the sclera near the entrance of that nerve, and run\r\nforward between the sclera and chorioidea to the circumference of the\r\niris. Here the branches of adjacent nerves anastomose to form a circular\r\nplexus (Plexus gangliosus ciliaris), from which filaments go to the\r\nciliary body, iris, and cornea.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The circular fibers of the iris and the ciliary muscle are innervated\r\n  by fibers derived from the oculomotor nerve, the radial fibers of the\r\n  iris by the sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The =maxillary nerve= (N. maxillaris), also termed the superior\r\nmaxillary, is purely sensory and is much larger than the ophthalmic. It\r\nextends forward from the semilunar ganglion in the middle cranial fossa\r\nin the large groove on the root of the temporal wing of the sphenoid. It\r\nis related internally to the cavernous sinus and superiorly to the\r\nophthalmic nerve, with which it is blended for some distance. It emerges\r\nthrough the foramen rotundum, passes forward in the pterygo-palatine\r\nfossa above the internal maxillary artery and embedded in fat, and is\r\ncontinued in the infraorbital canal as the infraorbital nerve (Fig.\r\n439). Its branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =zygomatic nerve= (N. zygomaticus s. subcutaneus malæ), also\r\ntermed the orbital branch, arises before the maxillary nerve reaches the\r\npterygo-palatine fossa (Figs. 438, 439, 514). It pierces the periorbita\r\nand divides into two or three delicate branches which pass along the\r\nsurface of the external straight muscle to the external canthus and\r\nramify chiefly in the lower lid and the adjacent skin. Anastomoses are\r\nformed with branches of the lacrimal nerve.\r\n\r\n2. The =sphenopalatine nerve= (N. sphenopalatinus) is given off in the\r\npterygo-palatine fossa from the lower border of the maxillary nerve\r\n(Fig. 439). It is broad and flat and forms a plexus in which several\r\nsmall =sphenopalatine ganglia= are interposed. It divides into posterior\r\nnasal, and greater and lesser palatine nerves. (1) The =posterior nasal\r\nnerve= (N. nasalis aboralis) passes through the sphenopalatine foramen,\r\nin which it bears one or more minute ganglia, enters the nasal cavity,\r\nand divides into internal and external branches (Figs. 440, 464). The\r\ninternal branch (N. septi narium) runs forward in the submucous tissue\r\nof the lower part of the septum nasi, gives twigs to the mucous membrane\r\nhere and to the vomero-nasal organ (of Jacobson), passes through the\r\npalatine cleft and ramifies in the anterior part of the hard palate. The\r\nexternal branch (Ramus lateralis) ramifies in the mucous membrane of the\r\ninferior turbinal and the middle and inferior meatus nasi. (2) The\r\n=greater= or =anterior palatine nerve= (N. palatinus major s. anterior)\r\n(Figs. 438, 439) is the largest of the three branches. It runs forward\r\nin the palatine canal and groove and ramifies in the hard palate and\r\ngums. It also supplies twigs to the soft palate, and gives off branches\r\nwhich pass through the accessory palatine foramina to supply the mucous\r\nmembrane of the inferior meatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The branches of the two nerves anastomose in the hard palate and form\r\n  a plexus about the branches of the palatine arteries.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 514.—DISSECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The masseter and superficial muscles and the parotid gland are in\r\n    great part removed. _a_, _a_, Levator labii superioris proprius;\r\n    _b_, _b_, levator nasolabialis; _c_, dilatator naris inferior; _d_,\r\n    buccinator; _e_, common mass of buccinator and depressor labii\r\n    inferioris; _f_, depressor labii inferioris; _g_, masseter; _h_,\r\n    orbicularis oculi; _i_, temporalis; _k_, occipito-hyoideus; _k′_,\r\n    stylo-maxillaris; _l_, sterno-cephalicus; _l′_, tendon of same; _m_,\r\n    omo-hyoideus; _n_, crico-pharyngeus; _o_, mastoid tendon of\r\n    mastoido-humeralis; _p_, splenius; _q_, inferior buccal and labial\r\n    glands; _r_, superior buccal glands; _s_, remnant of parotid gland;\r\n    _t_, submaxillary gland; _u_, anterior cervical (subparotid) lymph\r\n    glands; _v_, probe passed into diverticulum nasi; _w_, cornu of alar\r\n    cartilage; _x_, internal palpebral ligament; _y_, wing of atlas;\r\n    _z_, scutiform cartilage of ear; _1_, external nasal nerve; _2_,\r\n    anterior nasal nerve; _3_, superior labial nerve; _4_, anterior part\r\n    of superior buccal nerve; _5_, buccinator nerve; _6_, _6′_, inferior\r\n    alveolar nerve; _6″_, mental nerve-continuation of _6_; _7_,\r\n    masseteric nerve; _8_, facial nerve (cut); _9_, superficial temporal\r\n    nerve; _10_, anastomosis between _9_ and _8_; _11_, internal\r\n    auricular nerve; _12_, posterior auricular nerve; _13_, digastric\r\n    nerve; _14_, cervical branch of facial nerve (cut); _15_,\r\n    auriculo-palpebral nerve; _16_, lacrimal nerve; _17_, frontal nerve;\r\n    _18_, infratrochlear nerve; _19_, n. zygomaticus s. subcutaneus\r\n    malæ; _20_, spinal accessory nerve; _21_, ventral branch of spinal\r\n    accessory nerve (to sterno-cephalicus); _22_, ventral end branch of\r\n    first cervical nerve; _23_, thyro-laryngeal artery; _24_, internal\r\n    maxillary artery; _25_, masseteric artery; _26_, great (posterior)\r\n    auricular artery; _27_, external branch of _26_; _28_, deep\r\n    auricular artery; _29_, superficial temporal artery; _30_,\r\n    transverse facial artery; _31_, facial artery; _32_, inferior labial\r\n    artery; _33_, superior labial artery; _34_, lateral nasal artery;\r\n    _35_, dorsal nasal artery; _36_, angular artery of eye; _37_, labial\r\n    twigs of palato-labial artery—left uncolored by oversight; _38_,\r\n    branch of buccinator artery; _39_, buccinator vein; _40_, vena\r\n    reflexa; _41_, _42_, jugular vein; _43_, external maxillary vein;\r\n    _44_, inferior cerebral vein; _45_, stump of great auricular vein;\r\n    _46_, ramus of mandible; _47_, facial crest; _48_, zygomatic arch;\r\n    _49_, parotid duct. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n(3) The =lesser= or =posterior palatine nerve= (N. palatinus minor s.\r\nposterior), also termed the staphyline, is much the smallest of the\r\nthree branches (Figs. 438, 439). It passes downward and forward with the\r\npalatine vein in the groove at the inner side of the tuber maxillare and\r\nramifies in the soft palate.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The sphenopalatine ganglia and plexus (Fig. 515) lie on the\r\n  perpendicular part of the palate bone and the pterygoid process under\r\n  cover of the maxillary nerve. The afferent fibers of the plexus and\r\n  ganglia come chiefly from the branches of the sphenopalatine nerve and\r\n  the nerve of the pterygoid canal. Interspersed in these are several\r\n  minute ganglia and one or more larger ones. The =nerve of the\r\n  pterygoid canal= or =Vidian nerve= (N. canalis pterygoidei) is formed\r\n  by the union of sympathetic fibers with the superficial petrosal\r\n  branch of the facial nerve. It passes forward at first between the\r\n  Eustachian tube and the sphenoid bone, enters the canal between the\r\n  pterygoid bone and process, and joins the posterior part of the\r\n  plexus. It is probable that it furnishes the motor fibers to the\r\n  levator palati and palatinus muscles. Efferent filaments go to the\r\n  periorbita and the ophthalmic vessels, and others accompany the\r\n  branches of the maxillary nerve, around which they have a plexiform\r\n  arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The =infraorbital nerve= (N. infraorbitalis) is the continuation of\r\nthe maxillary trunk. It traverses the infraorbital canal, emerges\r\nthrough the infraorbital foramen, and divides into nasal and superior\r\nlabial branches. Along its course it gives off =superior alveolar= or\r\n=dental branches= (Rami alveolares maxillæ), which supply the teeth,\r\nalveolar periosteum, and gums.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The delicate posterior alveolar branches are given off in the\r\n  pterygo-palatine fossa, pass through small foramina in the tuber\r\n  maxillare, and supply the posterior molar teeth and the maxillary\r\n  sinus. The middle alveolar branches are given off in the infraorbital\r\n  canal, and constitute the chief nerve-supply to the cheek teeth and\r\n  the maxillary sinus. The anterior or incisor branch runs forward in\r\n  the anterior alveolar or incisor canal and supplies branches to the\r\n  canine and incisor teeth. The foregoing unite with each other to form\r\n  the superior dental plexus, from which the dental and gingival\r\n  branches are given off.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =external nasal branches= (Rami nasales externi), two or three in\r\nnumber, accompany the levator labii superioris proprius and ramify in\r\nthe dorsum nasi and the nasal diverticulum.\r\n\r\nThe large =anterior nasal branch= (Ramus nasalis anterior) passes over\r\nthe nasal process of the premaxilla under cover of the dilatator naris\r\ninferior, gives branches to the nasal mucous membrane, and terminates in\r\nthe skin of the upper lip.\r\n\r\nThe =superior labial branch= (Ramus labialis dorsalis) is the largest of\r\nthe terminals of the infraorbital nerve. It passes downward and forward\r\nunder the levator nasolabialis and, after supplying the skin of the\r\nanterior part of the cheek, forms a rich terminal ramification in the\r\nskin and mucous membrane of the upper lip. It anastomoses with the\r\nsuperior buccal branch of the facial nerve.\r\n\r\nIII. The =mandibular nerve= (N. mandibularis), also termed the inferior\r\nmaxillary branch, is formed by the union of two roots; of these the\r\nlarge sensory root comes from the semilunar ganglion, and the small\r\nmotor root is the pars minor of the trigeminus. It emerges from the\r\ncranium through the oval notch of the foramen lacerum, between the\r\ntemporal wing of the sphenoid bone and the muscular process of the\r\npetrous temporal, and gives off the following branches:\r\n\r\n1. The =masseteric nerve= (N. massetericus) (Figs. 437, 515) passes\r\noutward through the sigmoid notch of the mandible and enters the deep\r\nface of the masseter muscle, in which it ramifies.\r\n\r\n2. The =deep temporal nerves= (Nn. temporales profundi) (Fig. 437), two\r\nor three in number, arise by a common trunk with the masseteric. They\r\nsupply the temporal muscle.\r\n\r\n3. The =buccinator nerve= (N. buccinatorius) passes obliquely forward\r\nthrough the anterior part of the external pterygoid muscle, then between\r\nthe internal pterygoid and the tuber maxillare (Fig. 514). It continues\r\nforward in the submucous tissue of the cheek along the lower border of\r\nthe buccinator and divides into branches which ramify in the mucous\r\nmembrane and glands of the lips in the vicinity of the commissure. It\r\nsupplies small branches to the external pterygoid and temporal muscles\r\nand detaches numerous collateral twigs to the mucous membrane of the\r\ncheek and to the buccal glands. It also communicates with the inferior\r\nbuccal branch of the facial nerve.\r\n\r\n4. The =pterygoid nerve= (N. pterygoideus) arises in common with the\r\npreceding, passes forward on the guttural pouch, and divides into\r\nbranches for the pterygoid muscles (Fig. 515).\r\n\r\nThe =otic ganglion= (G. oticum) is situated near the origin of the\r\npterygoid and buccinator nerves, and is related internally to the tensor\r\npalati and the Eustachian tube. It receives motor fibers from the\r\npterygoid nerve and sensory fibers by the small superficial petrosal\r\nnerve from the tympanic plexus, through which communications are made\r\nwith the facial and glosso-pharyngeal nerves. Sympathetic fibers are\r\nderived from the plexus on the internal maxillary artery. Efferent\r\nfilaments go to the tensor palati, tensor tympani, and pterygoid\r\nmuscles, and to the Eustachian tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The ganglion is small and somewhat difficult to demonstrate. In many\r\n  cases it is replaced by a number of minute ganglia interspersed in a\r\n  fine plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. The =superficial temporal nerve= (N. temporalis superficialis) (Figs.\r\n437, 514, 515) runs outward across the pterygoideus externus, passes\r\nbetween the parotid gland and the neck of the ramus of the mandible,\r\nturns around the latter, and divides into two branches. The upper branch\r\n(Ramus transversus faciei) accompanies the transverse facial vessels and\r\nramifies in the skin of the cheek. The larger inferior branch unites\r\nwith the inferior buccal division of the facial nerve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 515.—DEEP DISSECTION OF BASE OF CRANIUM, VIEWED FROM THE RIGHT\r\n    AND BELOW.\r\n\r\n  The tympanic cavity is opened and the paramastoid process is sawn off.\r\n    _a_, Occipital condyle; _b_, body of sphenoid; _c_, external\r\n    auditory meatus (part removed); _d_, malleus; _e_, incus; _1_, stump\r\n    of ophthalmic nerve; _2_, maxillary nerve (cut off); _3_,\r\n    sphenopalatine plexus; _4_, Vidian nerve; _4′_, deep petrosal nerve;\r\n    _4″_, branch to tympanic plexus; _4‴_, superficial petrosal nerve;\r\n    _5_, superficial temporal nerve (cut off); _6_, masseteric nerve\r\n    (cut off); _7_, mandibular nerve (raised); _8_, lingual nerve (cut\r\n    off); _9_, pterygoid nerve (cut); _10_, nerve to tensor tympani;\r\n    _11_, otic ganglion; _12_, facial nerve; _13_, stapedial nerve;\r\n    _14_, chorda tympani; _15_, glosso-pharyngeal nerve (cut); _16_,\r\n    tympanic nerve; _17_, vagus (cut off); _18_, auricular branch of\r\n    vagus; _19_, spinal accessory nerve (cut off); _20_, hypoglossal\r\n    nerve (cut off); _21_, sympathetic nerve (cut off); _22_, internal\r\n    carotid artery. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nBefore its division the nerve gives off twigs to the guttural pouch, the\r\nparotid gland, the external ear, and the skin of the external auditory\r\nmeatus and the membrana tympani. Branches from it concur with filaments\r\nfrom the cervical branch of the facial nerve in the formation of the\r\nauricular plexus.\r\n\r\n6. The =inferior alveolar= or =dental nerve= (N. alveolaris mandibulæ)\r\n(Figs. 436, 437, 514) arises with the lingual by a common trunk which\r\npasses forward at first on the external pterygoid muscle, then inclines\r\nventrally between the internal pterygoid and the ramus of the mandible.\r\nThe lingual and alveolar separate at an acute angle, and the latter\r\nenters the mandibular foramen and courses in the canal within the ramus\r\n(Fig. 516). Emerging at the mental foramen, it terminates by dividing\r\ninto six to eight inferior labial and mental branches, which ramify in\r\nthe lower lip and chin. Before entering the bone, the nerve detaches the\r\n=mylo-hyoid nerve= (N. mylo-hyoideus), which runs downward and forward\r\nbetween the ramus and the mylo-hyoid muscle; it supplies that muscle,\r\nthe anterior belly of the digastricus, and the skin of the anterior part\r\nof the submaxillary space. The dental and gingival branches detached\r\nfrom the nerve within the mandible are arranged like the corresponding\r\nnerves of the upper jaw.\r\n\r\n7. The =lingual nerve= (N. lingualis) arises by a common trunk with the\r\ninferior alveolar or dental nerve (Figs. 436, 437). After separating\r\nfrom the latter it runs downward and forward, lying at first between the\r\nramus of the mandible and the internal pterygoid muscle, then on the\r\ninner face of the mylo-hyoid. On reaching the root of the tongue it\r\ndivides into superficial and deep branches. The =superficial branch=\r\n(Ramus superficialis) runs forward on the stylo-glossus and accompanies\r\nthe submaxillary duct on the deep face of the sublingual gland. It\r\nsupplies the mucous membrane of the tongue and the floor of the mouth.\r\nAt the root of the tongue it gives off a recurrent branch to the isthmus\r\nfaucium, which communicates with the lingual branch of the\r\nglosso-pharyngeal nerve. The larger =deep branch= (Ramus profundus)\r\nturns around the lower edge of the hyo-glossus, passes upward and\r\nforward between that muscle and the genio-glossus, and continues forward\r\non the latter to the tip of the tongue. It gives branches to the mucous\r\nmembrane and the fungiform papillæ of the tongue, and anastomoses with\r\nbranches of the hypoglossal nerve and with the superficial branch.\r\nMinute ganglia occur on the finer branches of the lingual nerve. The\r\n=chorda tympani= branch of the facial joins the lingual nerve at the\r\norigin of the latter and is incorporated with it in its distribution to\r\nthe tongue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 516.—PART OF BRANCH OF LOWER JAW OF HORSE, INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The bone has been removed to show the vessels and nerves. _1_, _1′_,\r\n    Inferior alveolar or dental nerve; _2_, _2_, branches to cheek teeth\r\n    and gums; _2′_, branch to canine and incisor teeth; _3_, _3′_,\r\n    inferior alveolar or dental artery; _4_, satellite vein. (After\r\n    Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE SIXTH OR ABDUCENT NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =abducent nerve= (N. abducens) emerges from the brain behind the\r\npons and just external to the pyramid (Fig. 499). It passes forward\r\nacross the pons, pierces the dura mater, and accompanies the third and\r\nophthalmic nerves, below which it emerges through the foramen lacerum\r\norbitale. In the orbit it divides into two branches; the larger of these\r\nenters the external rectus, the smaller supplies the superior and\r\nexternal parts of the retractor muscle of the eyeball. Within the\r\ncranium it receives filaments from the carotid plexus of the\r\nsympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fibers of the abducent nerve are axones of the large multipolar\r\n  cells of the abducent nucleus which is situated beneath the eminentia\r\n  teres of the floor of the fourth ventricle. The nucleus lies within\r\n  the loop formed by the fibers of origin of the facial nerve. It is\r\n  connected with (_a_) the anterior olive; (_b_) the oculomotor nucleus\r\n  of the opposite side; (_c_) the motor area of the cerebral cortex by\r\n  means of the pyramidal tract of the opposite side.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE SEVENTH OR FACIAL NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =facial nerve= (N. facialis) has its superficial origin at the\r\nlateral part of the corpus trapezoideum, immediately behind the pons\r\n(Fig. 499). It passes outward in front of the eighth nerve and enters\r\nthe internal auditory meatus. At the bottom of the meatus the two nerves\r\npart company, the facial coursing in the facial canal of the petrous\r\ntemporal bone. The canal and nerve are at first directed outward between\r\nthe vestibule and the cochlea, then curve backward and downward in the\r\nposterior wall of the tympanum to end at the stylo-mastoid foramen. The\r\nbend formed by the nerve is called the =knee= (Geniculum n. facialis)\r\nand bears at its highest point the round =geniculate ganglion= (G.\r\ngeniculi).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The nerve consists of two parts, motor and sensory. The =motor part=\r\n  constitutes the bulk of the nerve. Its deep origin is from the cells\r\n  of the =facial nucleus=, which is situated in the medulla above the\r\n  facial tubercle. On leaving the nucleus the root-fibers pass upward\r\n  and inward, incline forward close to the median plane, and then bend\r\n  sharply downward to the point of emergence. The highest point of the\r\n  bend is subjacent to the gray matter of the eminentia teres in the\r\n  floor of the fourth ventricle, and the abducent nucleus lies in the\r\n  concavity of the curve. The small =sensory part= (N. intermedius)\r\n  consists of axones of cells of the geniculate ganglion, which is\r\n  interposed on the facial nerve as it bends downward in the facial\r\n  canal. The fibers of this part after entering the medulla, pass to the\r\n  nucleus of termination which it shares with the ninth and tenth\r\n  nerves. The peripheral fibers from the geniculate ganglion constitute\r\n  the chorda tympani.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter its emergence through the stylo-mastoid foramen (Fig. 514) the\r\nnerve passes downward, forward, and outward on the guttural pouch under\r\ncover of the parotid gland, and crosses between the origin of the\r\nsuperficial temporal and internal maxillary arteries internally and the\r\nsuperficial temporal vein externally. It then crosses the posterior\r\nborder of the ramus of the mandible ventral to the transverse facial\r\nartery and about an inch and a half (ca. 3.5 to 4 cm.) below the\r\narticulation of the jaw. Emerging from beneath the parotid gland upon\r\nthe masseter muscle, it receives the lower branch of the superficial\r\ntemporal nerve, and divides into superior and inferior buccal branches.\r\nThe following collateral branches are given off, the first five being\r\ndetached within the facial canal, and the others between the\r\nstylo-mastoid foramen and the border of the jaw.\r\n\r\n1. The =great superficial petrosal nerve= (N. petrosus superficialis\r\nmajor) arises from the geniculate ganglion.[203] It passes through the\r\npetrosal canal, contributes a filament to the tympanic plexus, receives\r\nthe great deep petrosal nerve from the carotid plexus of the\r\nsympathetic, emerges through the foramen lacerum, and is continued as\r\nthe Vidian nerve to the sphenopalatine plexus and ganglia (Fig. 515).\r\n\r\n2. A delicate branch (R. anastomoticus cum plexu tympanico) emerges from\r\nthe geniculate ganglion and unites with a filament issuing from the\r\ntympanic plexus to form the =small superficial petrosal nerve= (N.\r\npetrosus superficialis minor); this ends in the otic ganglion.\r\n\r\n3. The =stapedial nerve= (N. stapedius) (Fig. 515) is a short filament\r\ndetached from the facial nerve as it turns down in the facial canal. It\r\ninnervates the stapedius muscle.\r\n\r\n4. The =chorda tympani= (Fig. 515) is a small nerve which arises a\r\nlittle below the preceding and pursues a recurrent course in a small\r\ncanal in the mastoid part of the temporal bone to reach the tympanic\r\ncavity. It traverses the latter, passing between the handle of the\r\nmalleus and the long branch of the incus. Emerging through the\r\npetro-tympanic fissure, the nerve passes downward and forward, crosses\r\nbeneath the internal maxillary artery, and joins the lingual nerve. It\r\nsends twigs to the submaxillary and sublingual glands, and through its\r\nincorporation with the lingual nerve furnishes fibers to the mucous\r\nmembrane of the anterior two-thirds of the tongue which are believed to\r\nmediate the sense of taste.\r\n\r\n5. Anastomotic filaments unite with the auricular branch of the vagus\r\nnear the stylo-mastoid foramen.\r\n\r\n6. The =posterior auricular nerve= (N. auricularis posterior) arises\r\nfrom the facial at its emergence from the facial canal (Fig. 514). It\r\nruns upward and backward with the posterior auricular artery under cover\r\nof the parotid gland and supplies the posterior auricular muscles and\r\nthe skin of the convex surface of the external ear. It anastomoses with\r\nbranches of the first and second cervical nerves.\r\n\r\n7. The =internal auricular nerve= (N. auricularis internus) springs from\r\nthe facial close to or in common with the preceding (Fig. 514). It\r\nascends in the parotid gland just behind the styloid process of the\r\nconchal cartilage, passes through an opening in the cartilage, and\r\nramifies in the skin of the concave surface of the ear.\r\n\r\n8. The =digastric branch= (R. digastricus) (Fig. 514) arises from the\r\nfacial below the auricular nerves. Its branches innervate the posterior\r\nbelly of the digastricus, the stylo-hyoideus, and the occipito-hyoideus.\r\nAt its origin it gives off a small branch which forms a loop around the\r\ngreat auricular artery or its posterior branch and rejoins the trunk.\r\n\r\n9. The =auriculo-palpebral nerve= (N. auriculo-palpebralis) (Fig. 514)\r\narises from the upper edge of the facial near the posterior border of\r\nthe ramus. It ascends in the parotid gland behind the superficial\r\ntemporal artery, and terminates in anterior auricular and temporal\r\nbranches. The =anterior auricular branches= form with branches of the\r\ntrigeminus the =anterior auricular plexus=. They innervate the anterior\r\nauricular and parotido-auricularis muscles. The =temporal branch= runs\r\nforward and inward over the temporal muscle to the inner canthus of the\r\neye, forms a plexus with the terminal branches of the ophthalmic nerve,\r\nand is distributed to the orbicularis oculi, corrugator supercilii, and\r\nlevator nasolabialis.\r\n\r\n10. The =cervical branch= (R. colli) (Fig. 435) arises from the ventral\r\nborder of the facial opposite to the preceding nerve. It emerges\r\nobliquely through the parotid gland, passes downward and backward on or\r\nnear the jugular vein, and anastomoses with the cutaneous branches of\r\nthe cervical nerves. It gives branches to the parotido-auricularis and\r\nthe cervical panniculus. In its course along the neck the nerve is\r\nreinforced by twigs from the cutaneous branches of the second to the\r\nsixth cervical nerves.\r\n\r\n11. Small branches are detached to the guttural pouch and the parotid\r\ngland. The latter (Rami parotidei) concur with branches of the\r\nsuperficial temporal nerve in forming the =parotid plexus=.\r\n\r\nThe facial nerve usually terminates after a short course on the surface\r\nof the masseter by dividing into two buccal branches (Figs. 435, 461).\r\n\r\n1. The =superior buccal nerve= (N. buccalis dorsalis) passes forward on\r\nthe upper part of the masseter, dips under the zygomaticus, and\r\ncontinues along the lower border of the dilatator naris lateralis. It\r\nthen runs under the last-named muscle and anastomoses with branches of\r\nthe infraorbital nerve, and is distributed to the muscles of the cheek,\r\nupper lip, and nostril.\r\n\r\n2. The =inferior buccal nerve= (N. buccalis ventralis) crosses the\r\nmasseter obliquely and continues forward along the depressor labii\r\ninferioris. It is connected by variable anastomotic branches with the\r\nsuperior nerve. It gives collateral branches to the panniculus,\r\nbuccinator, and depressor labii inferioris, and ramifies with the\r\nterminal branches of the inferior alveolar nerve in the lower lip.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The buccal nerves are subject to much variation in regard to their\r\n  course, anastomoses, and relations to the sensory components derived\r\n  from the superficial temporal nerve. Their distribution is constant.\r\n  The point at which the branch of the superficial temporal nerve joins\r\n  the facial is variable.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE EIGHTH OR AUDITORY NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =auditory nerve= (N. acusticus) is connected with the lateral aspect\r\nof the medulla just behind and external to the facial (Fig. 499). It has\r\ntwo roots, vestibular and cochlear (Radix vestibularis et cochlearis).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The auditory nerve consists of two distinct parts which might well be\r\n  regarded as separate nerves. The cochlear part mediates the sense of\r\n  hearing, while the vestibular part is not auditory in function, but is\r\n  concerned in the sense of the position of the body and the mechanism\r\n  of equilibration.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nerve passes outward to the internal auditory meatus, which it\r\nenters behind the facial nerve. In the meatus it divides into two\r\nnerves, of which the upper is the vestibular and the lower is the\r\ncochlear nerve.\r\n\r\n1. The =vestibular nerve= (N. vestibuli) is distributed to the\r\nutriculus, the sacculus, and to the ampullæ of the semicircular canals,\r\nof the internal ear. In the internal auditory meatus the nerve is\r\nconnected by filaments with the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve.\r\nAt the bottom of the meatus it bears the =vestibular ganglion= (G.\r\nvestibulare), from the cells of which the fibers of the nerve arise.\r\n\r\n2. The =cochlear nerve= (N. cochleæ) detaches a filament to the\r\nsacculus, passes through the lamina cribrosa to the labyrinth, and is\r\ndistributed to the organ of Corti in the cochlea.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fibers of the vestibular nerve arise from the vestibular ganglion\r\n  as central processes (axones) of the bipolar cells of the ganglion.\r\n  The peripheral processes (dendrites) of the cells form arborizations\r\n  about the deep ends of the hair cells of the maculæ and cristæ\r\n  acusticæ of the utriculus, sacculus, and semicircular canals. The\r\n  fibers enter the medulla, pass between the restiform body and the\r\n  spinal tract of the trigeminus, and spread out to end in the\r\n  vestibular nucleus in the floor of the fourth ventricle. Among the\r\n  central connections of the vestibular nerve are: (1) fibers which\r\n  connect its nucleus with centers in the cerebellum (chiefly of the\r\n  opposite side); (2) the vestibulo-spinal tract, which conveys impulses\r\n  to the motor cells of the ventral columns of the spinal cord; (3)\r\n  fibers which connect the nucleus with those of the abducent nerve of\r\n  the same side, the third and fourth nerves, and the motor part of the\r\n  trigeminus of both sides.\r\n\r\n  The fibers of the cochlear nerve are the central processes of the\r\n  bipolar cells of the spiral ganglion of the cochlea. The peripheral\r\n  processes of these cells end in relation to the hair cells of the\r\n  organ of Corti. Some of the nerve-fibers enter the ventral cochlear\r\n  nucleus in the medulla close to the superficial origin of the nerve;\r\n  others end in the dorsal nucleus of the tuberculum acusticum at the\r\n  lateral angle of the floor of the fourth ventricle. From the ventral\r\n  nucleus fibers pass in the corpus trapezoideum to the anterior olivary\r\n  nucleus of the same and of the opposite side. Thence tracts pass to\r\n  the nuclei of the motor nerves of the eye, and through the lateral\r\n  fillet to the posterior quadrigeminal body and the internal geniculate\r\n  body. The axones of the cells of the dorsal nucleus pass largely (as\r\n  the striæ acusticæ) over the restiform body and across the floor of\r\n  the fourth ventricle toward the median plane. They then turn\r\n  ventrally, cross to the opposite side, and are continued by the\r\n  lateral fillet. From the mid-brain a tract proceeds to the cortex of\r\n  the temporal lobe of the hemisphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE NINTH OR GLOSSO-PHARYNGEAL NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =glosso-pharyngeal nerve= (N. glossopharyngeus) is attached to the\r\nanterior part of the lateral aspect of the medulla by several filaments\r\n(Fig. 499). The root-bundles enter the furrow ventral to the restiform\r\nbody; they are separated by a short interval from the origin of the\r\nfacial nerve, but are not marked off behind from the roots of the vagus.\r\nThe bundles converge laterally to form a nerve which perforates the dura\r\nmater and emerges through the foramen lacerum posterius just in front of\r\nthe tenth nerve (Fig. 515). As it issues from the cranium the nerve\r\nbears a considerable ovoid gray enlargement, the =petrous ganglion= (G.\r\npetrosum).[204] It then curves downward and forward over the guttural\r\npouch and behind the great cornu of the hyoid bone, crosses the deep\r\nface of the external carotid artery, and divides into pharyngeal and\r\nlingual branches (Fig. 437). The collateral branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =tympanic nerve= (N. tympanicus) (Fig. 515) arises from the\r\npetrous ganglion and passes upward between the petrous and tympanic\r\nparts of the temporal bone to reach the cavity of the tympanum. Here it\r\nbreaks up into branches to form, along with branches from the carotid\r\nplexus of the sympathetic, the =tympanic plexus=. From the plexus\r\nbranches pass to the mucous membrane of the tympanum and the Eustachian\r\ntube. The continuation of the nerve issues from the plexus and unites\r\nwith a filament from the geniculate ganglion of the facial to form the\r\nsmall superficial petrosal nerve; this runs forward and ends in the otic\r\nganglion.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Filaments also connect the petrous ganglion with the jugular ganglion\r\n  of the vagus nerve and with the superior cervical ganglion of the\r\n  sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. A considerable branch runs backward on the guttural pouch,\r\ncontributes filaments to the pharyngeal plexus, and concurs with twigs\r\nfrom the vagus and the sympathetic in forming the carotid plexus on the\r\nterminal part of the carotid artery and on its chief branches. In this\r\nplexus is the small ganglion intercaroticum.\r\n\r\nThe =pharyngeal branch= (R. pharyngeus) (Fig. 437) is the smaller of the\r\ntwo terminal branches. It runs forward across the deep face of the great\r\ncornu of the hyoid bone and concurs with the pharyngeal branches of the\r\nvagus and with sympathetic filaments in forming the pharyngeal plexus;\r\nfrom this branches pass to the muscles and mucous membrane of the\r\npharynx.\r\n\r\nThe =lingual branch= (R. lingualis) is the continuation of the trunk\r\n(Fig. 437). It runs along the posterior border of the great cornu of the\r\nhyoid bone in front of the external maxillary artery and dips under the\r\nhyo-glossus muscle. It gives collateral branches to the soft palate,\r\nisthmus faucium, and tonsil, and ends in the mucous membrane of the\r\nposterior part of the tongue, where it supplies gustatory fibers to the\r\nvallate papillæ. A considerable branch unites with a twig from the\r\nlingual nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The glosso-pharyngeal is a mixed nerve, containing both motor and\r\n  sensory fibers. The latter constitute the bulk of the nerve and\r\n  include those which mediate the special sense of taste. They are\r\n  processes of the cells of the petrous ganglion. The central processes\r\n  of the ganglion cells enter the medulla, pass upward and inward\r\n  through the formatio reticularis, and end in the nucleus of\r\n  termination in the floor of the fourth ventricle. The motor fibers\r\n  arise from dorsal and ventral efferent nuclei in the medulla. The\r\n  glosso-pharyngeal shares these nuclei with the vagus and has\r\n  practically the same central connections as that nerve (_q. v._).\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE TENTH, VAGUS, OR PNEUMOGASTRIC NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =vagus= or =pneumogastric= (N. vagus) is the longest and most widely\r\ndistributed of the cranial nerves; it is also remarkable for the\r\nconnections which it forms with adjacent nerves and with the\r\nsympathetic. It is attached to the lateral aspect of the medulla by\r\nseveral filaments which are in series with those of the ninth nerve in\r\nfront and the eleventh nerve behind (Fig. 499). The bundles converge to\r\nform a trunk which passes outward, pierces the dura mater, and emerges\r\nfrom the cranium through the foramen lacerum posterius (Fig. 515). In\r\nthe foramen the nerve bears on its lateral aspect the elongated\r\nflattened =jugular ganglion= (G. jugulare).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The ganglion communicates with (_a_) the tympanic nerve, (_b_) the\r\n  petrous ganglion of the ninth nerve, (_c_) the spinal accessory, and\r\n  (_d_) the hypoglossal. It also gives off the =auricular branch= (R.\r\n  auricularis), which runs forward below the petrous ganglion and passes\r\n  through a small canal in the petrous temporal bone to gain the facial\r\n  canal. Here it gives filaments to the facial and emerges with that\r\n  nerve through the stylo-mastoid foramen. It ascends behind the\r\n  external auditory meatus, dips under the rotator longus muscle, and\r\n  passes through a foramen in the conchal cartilage to ramify in the\r\n  integument which lines the meatus and the adjacent part of the ear.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeyond the ganglion the vagus runs backward and downward with the spinal\r\naccessory in a fold of the guttural pouch (Fig. 437). Then the two\r\nnerves separate, allowing the hypoglossal to pass between them, and the\r\nvagus descends with the internal carotid artery and crosses the inner\r\nface of the origin of the occipital artery. Here it is joined by the\r\ncervical trunk of the sympathetic, and the two nerves continue along the\r\ndorsal aspect of the common carotid artery in a common sheath (Fig.\r\n433). At the root of the neck the vagus separates from the sympathetic,\r\nand from this point backward the relations of the right and left vagi\r\ndiffer somewhat and must be described separately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 517.—CROSS-SECTION OF NECK OF HORSE, PASSING THROUGH POSTERIOR\r\n    PART OF ATLAS.\r\n\r\n  The head and neck were extended. _1_, Dorsal arch of atlas; _2_,\r\n    odontoid process; _3_, odontoid ligament; _4_, vertebral sinuses;\r\n    _5_, dura mater; _6_, spinal cord; _7_, vertebral artery; _8_, wing\r\n    of atlas; _9_, atlanto-axial joint cavity; _10_, œsophagus; _11_,\r\n    _11_, recurrent nerves; _12_, _12_, ventral branches of spinal\r\n    accessory nerves. By an oversight the obliquus cap. post. (above\r\n    wing of atlas) is unmarked.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =right vagus= (Fig. 429) enters the thorax in the angle of\r\ndivergence of the right brachial artery and the truncus bicaroticus. It\r\nthen passes backward and slightly upward, crossing obliquely the outer\r\nsurface of the brachiocephalic artery and the right face of the trachea.\r\nReaching the dorsal surface of the latter near the bifurcation, it\r\ndivides into dorsal and ventral branches.\r\n\r\nThe =left vagus= (Fig. 428) enters the thorax on the ventral face of the\r\nœsophagus, crosses obliquely under the left brachial artery, and passes\r\nback on the external surface of that vessel in company with a large\r\ncardiac nerve.[205] Separating from the latter, the vagus continues\r\nbackward on the left face of the aorta, inclines to the upper surface of\r\nthe left bronchus, and divides into dorsal and ventral branches.\r\n\r\nThe dorsal and ventral branches unite with the corresponding branches of\r\nthe opposite nerve, thus forming =dorsal= and =ventral œsophageal\r\ntrunks= (Truncus (œsophageus dorsalis, ventralis). These run backward in\r\nthe posterior mediastinum, above and below the œsophagus respectively,\r\nand enter the abdominal cavity through the hiatus œsophageus; they\r\nsupply branches to the œsophagus and anastomose with each other. The\r\ndorsal trunk receives the major part of its fibers from the right vagus.\r\nAfter entering the abdomen it passes to the left of the cardia, gives\r\nbranches to the visceral surface of the stomach, and ends in the cœliac\r\nand subsidiary plexuses. The ventral trunk passes to the lesser\r\ncurvature of the stomach and ramifies on the parietal surface of the\r\nstomach; it forms here the anterior gastric plexus, from which branches\r\nare supplied also to the first part of the duodenum and to the liver.\r\n\r\nThe collateral branches of the vagus are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =pharyngeal branch= (R. pharyngeus) is given off in relation to\r\nthe superior cervical ganglion, turns around the internal carotid\r\nartery, and runs downward and forward on the guttural pouch to the\r\ndorsal wall of the pharynx (Fig. 437). Here its branches concur with the\r\npharyngeal branch of the ninth nerve and with filaments from the spinal\r\naccessory and the sympathetic in forming the =pharyngeal plexus=. This\r\nsupplies numerous twigs to the pharynx, and a larger branch which passes\r\nalong the side of the œsophagus and ramifies in its cervical part.\r\n\r\n\r\n  According to Ellenberger and Baum the pharyngeal plexus receives\r\n  filaments also from the digastric, superior laryngeal, hypoglossal,\r\n  and first cervical nerves. The branches of the plexus form secondary\r\n  intermuscular and submucous plexuses, in which there are numerous\r\n  minute ganglia.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The =superior= or =anterior laryngeal nerve= (N. laryngeus cranialis)\r\nis larger than the preceding and arises a little behind it (Fig. 437).\r\nIt crosses the deep face of the origin of the external carotid artery,\r\nruns downward and forward over the lateral wall of the pharynx behind\r\nthe hypoglossal nerve, and passes through the foramen below the anterior\r\ncornu of the thyroid cartilage. Its terminal branches ramify in the\r\nmucous membrane of the larynx, the floor of the pharynx, and the\r\nentrance to the œsophagus; they anastomose with those of the recurrent.\r\nAt its origin the nerve gives off its small =external branch= (R.\r\nexternus); this descends to the crico-thyroid muscle, which it supplies,\r\nand sends filaments to the crico-pharyngeus also. It may arise from the\r\ntrunk of the vagus or from the pharyngeal branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the point of origin of the superior laryngeal nerve there is a\r\n  plexiform widening which is regarded by some authors as the homologue\r\n  of the ganglion nodosum of man. From it a filament arises which, after\r\n  a short course, rejoins the vagus or enters the sympathetic trunk.\r\n  Stimulation of its central end causes a reduction of the\r\n  blood-pressure, and it is therefore termed the depressor nerve (N.\r\n  depressor).\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The =recurrent nerve= (N. recurrens), also termed the inferior or\r\nposterior laryngeal nerve, differs on the two sides in its point of\r\norigin and in the first part of its course. The =right nerve= (Fig. 429)\r\nis given off opposite the second rib, turns around the dorso-cervical\r\nartery from without inward, runs forward on the lower part of the\r\nlateral surface of the trachea, and ascends in the neck on the ventral\r\nface of the common carotid artery. The =left nerve= (Fig. 428) arises\r\nfrom the vagus where the latter begins to cross the aortic arch. It\r\npasses back over the ligamentum arteriosum, winds around the concavity\r\nof the aortic arch from without inward, runs forward on the lower part\r\nof the left face of the trachea, and continues in the neck in a similar\r\nposition to the right nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of note that the left nerve passes beneath the bronchial\r\n  lymph glands as it winds around the aorta; also that in the next part\r\n  of its course it lies between the left surface of the trachea and the\r\n  deep face of the aorta, and is then related to lymph glands which lie\r\n  along the ventral aspect of the trachea. The left recurrent is often\r\n  incorporated in part of its course in the anterior mediastinum with a\r\n  deep cardiac nerve. Further, the left nerve lies at first ventral to,\r\n  and then upon, the œsophagus in the neck. The right recurrent is given\r\n  off from or in common with a considerable trunk which connects the\r\n  vagus with the first thoracic ganglion of the sympathetic. The\r\n  arrangement here is commonly more or less plexiform, and from it one\r\n  or two cardiac nerves arise.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe terminal part of each nerve (Fig. 517) lies on the dorsal surface of\r\nthe trachea, in relation to the œsophagus internally and the carotid\r\nartery above.[206] It passes between the crico-arytenoideus posterior\r\nand the crico-pharyngeus; the =terminal branches= supply all the muscles\r\nof the larynx except the crico-thyroid, and communicate with branches of\r\nthe superior laryngeal nerve. =Collateral branches= are given off to the\r\ncardiac plexus (Rr. cardiaci), to the trachea (Rr. tracheales), to the\r\nœsophagus (Rr. œsophagei), and to the inferior cervical ganglion of the\r\nsympathetic.\r\n\r\n4. =Cardiac branches= (Rr. cardiaci), usually two or three in number,\r\nare given off from each vagus within the thorax (Figs. 428, 429). These\r\nconcur with the cardiac branches of the sympathetic and recurrent nerves\r\nto form the cardiac plexus, which innervates the heart and great\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\n5. Small =tracheal= and =œsophageal branches= (Rr. tracheales et\r\nœsophagei) are given off from both vagi in the thorax. These concur with\r\nbranches from the recurrent nerves and the inferior cervical and\r\nanterior thoracic ganglia of the sympathetic in forming the =posterior\r\ntracheal= and =œsophageal plexuses=, from which twigs go to the trachea,\r\nœsophagus, heart, and large vessels.\r\n\r\n6. =Bronchial branches= (Rr. bronchiales) are detached at the roots of\r\nthe lungs and unite with sympathetic filaments in forming the =pulmonary\r\nplexuses=. From the latter numerous branches proceed in a plexiform\r\nmanner along the bronchi and vessels into the substance of the lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The vagus and glosso-pharyngeal nerves are so closely associated in\r\n  origin and central connections that they may be described together in\r\n  this respect.\r\n\r\n  The =sensory fibers= arise from the petrous and jugular ganglia, and\r\n  their central parts enter the lateral aspect of the medulla and divide\r\n  into anterior and posterior branches like the fibers of the dorsal\r\n  roots of the spinal nerves. Most of the fibers end in arborizations\r\n  about the cells of the vago-glosso-pharyngeal nucleus of termination,\r\n  which consists of two parts. Of these the =dorsal sensory nucleus=\r\n  (Nucleus alæ cinereæ) is situated in the posterior part of the floor\r\n  of the fourth ventricle and in the adjacent part of the closed portion\r\n  of the medulla near the median plane. The other part is termed the\r\n  =nucleus of the solitary tract=, and is so named because its cells are\r\n  grouped about the bundle (Tractus solitarius) formed by the posterior\r\n  divisions of the afferent nerve-fibers. It ends about the level of the\r\n  pyramidal decussation. The secondary central connections are similar\r\n  to those of the sensory part of the trigeminus.\r\n\r\n  The =motor fibers= (and those of the medullary part of the accessory)\r\n  arise from the =dorsal motor nucleus= and the =ventral motor nucleus=.\r\n  The cells of the former lie in groups along the ventro-medial side of\r\n  the dorsal sensory nucleus. The latter, also termed the nucleus\r\n  ambiguus, is situated more deeply in the lateral part of the formatio\r\n  reticularis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE ELEVENTH OR SPINAL ACCESSORY NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =spinal accessory nerve= (N. accessorius) is purely motor. It\r\nconsists of two parts which differ in origin and function.\r\n\r\nThe =medullary part= arises from the lateral aspect of the medulla by\r\nseveral rootlets which are behind and in series with those of the vagus\r\n(Fig. 499). The =spinal part= arises from the cervical part of the\r\nspinal cord by a series of fasciculi which emerge between the dorsal and\r\nventral roots. The bundles unite to form a trunk which is very small at\r\nits origin at the fifth segment of the cord, but increases in size when\r\ntraced toward the brain, since it continually receives accessions of\r\nfibers. It passes through the foramen magnum and joins the medullary\r\npart. The trunk thus formed sends its medullary fibers to the tenth and\r\nninth nerves and emerges through the foramen lacerum posterius. It then\r\nruns backward and downward with the vagus in a fold of the guttural\r\npouch, separates from that nerve, crosses the deep face of the\r\nsubmaxillary gland and the occipital artery, and divides in the recessus\r\natlantis into dorsal and ventral branches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 518.—NECK OF HORSE, AFTER REMOVAL OF PART OF PANNICULUS AND\r\n    TRAPEZIUS.\r\n\r\n  _a_, _a′_, Mastoido-humeralis; _b_, anterior superficial pectoral\r\n    muscle; _c_, cervical panniculus; _d_, sterno-cephalicus; _e_,\r\n    omo-hyoideus; _f_, sterno-thyro-hyoideus; _g_, trachea; _h_,\r\n    _h′_, _h″_, tendons of splenius, mastoido-humeralis, and\r\n    trachelo-mastoideus; _i_, trapezius cervicalis; _k_,\r\n    supraspinatus; _l_, anterior deep pectoral muscle; _m_,\r\n    rhomboideus cervicalis; _n_, serratus cervicis; _o_, splenius,\r\n    upper and lower borders of which are indicated by dotted lines;\r\n    _p_, parotid gland; _q_, parotido-auricularis muscle; _r_, wing\r\n    of atlas; _s_, spine of scapula; _1_, external maxillary vein;\r\n    _2_, _3_, jugular vein; _4_, carotid artery; _5_, descending\r\n    branch of inferior cervical artery; _6_, cephalic vein; _7–11_,\r\n    ventral branches of second to seventh cervical nerves; _12_,\r\n    cutaneous branch of second cervical nerve; _13_, cervical branch\r\n    of facial nerve; _14_, terminal branches of dorsal divisions of\r\n    cervical nerves; _15_, dorsal branch of spinal accessory nerve.\r\n    (After Ellenberger-Baum, Top. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is connected by anastomotic branches with the vagus and hypoglossal\r\n  nerves and the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and\r\n  contributes a branch to the pharyngeal plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal branch= (R. dorsalis) (Figs. 433, 517, 518) receives a twig\r\nfrom the second and third cervical nerves and turns around the atlantal\r\ntendon of the splenius under cover of the mastoido-humeralis. It then\r\npasses obliquely through the latter muscle and continues backward on the\r\nsplenius and the cervical part of the serratus, inclines upward across\r\nthe anterior deep pectoral and the supraspinatus, and enters the deep\r\nface of the trapezius, in which it ramifies.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral branch= (R. ventralis) (Fig. 436) is smaller. It enters the\r\nsterno-cephalicus muscle behind the cervical angle of the parotid gland.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fibers of the spinal part of the accessory arise from the\r\n  ventro-lateral cells of the ventral gray column of the cord as far\r\n  back as the fifth cervical segment. The fibers of the medullary part\r\n  come chiefly from the nucleus ambiguus in common with the motor fibers\r\n  of the vagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE TWELFTH OR HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =hypoglossal nerve= (N. hypoglossus) is purely motor and innervates\r\nthe muscles of the tongue (Fig. 437). Its root-fibers arise from the\r\nventral face of the medulla in linear series about 3 to 4 mm. lateral to\r\nthe posterior half of the pyramid (Fig. 499). The filaments converge to\r\nthree or four bundles which perforate the dura mater and unite to form\r\nthe trunk. The latter emerges through the hypoglossal foramen (Fig. 515)\r\nand runs downward and backward between the guttural pouch and the\r\ncapsule of the atlanto-occipital articulation for a distance of a little\r\nless than an inch (ca. 2 cm.). It then passes between the tenth and\r\neleventh nerves, turns downward and forward, crosses the external face\r\nof the external carotid artery, and continues over the pharynx parallel\r\nwith the great cornu of the hyoid bone and behind the external maxillary\r\nartery. It then crosses beneath the artery, runs forward on the external\r\nface of the hyo-glossus muscle, and divides into its terminal branches\r\n(Rami linguales). The smaller branch supplies the stylo-glossus,\r\nhyo-glossus, and lingualis. The larger branch ramifies on the\r\ngenio-glossus and supplies the remaining muscles. Anastomoses occur with\r\nbranches of the lingual nerve.\r\n\r\nIn the first part of its course the nerve communicates with the superior\r\ncervical ganglion and with the ventral branch of the first cervical\r\nnerve, and gives filaments to the pharyngeal branch of the vagus and the\r\npharyngeal plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The fibers of the nerve arise from the hypoglossal nucleus, an\r\n  elongated group of large multipolar cells situated chiefly under the\r\n  posterior part of the floor of the fourth ventricle close to the\r\n  median plane. The two nuclei are connected by commissural fibers. The\r\n  other central connections include: (_a_) communications by the medial\r\n  longitudinal fasciculus with the nuclei of termination of other\r\n  cranial nerves; (_b_) cortico-nuclear fibers which come from the\r\n  cortex by way of the internal capsule and the pyramids and go largely\r\n  to the nucleus of the opposite side; (_c_) fibers which join the\r\n  dorsal longitudinal bundle of Schütz, a tract which underlies the\r\n  floor of the fourth ventricle and is traceable forward below the\r\n  cerebral aqueduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE SPINAL NERVES\r\n\r\nThe =spinal nerves= (Nervi spinales) are arranged in pairs, of which\r\nthere are usually forty-two in the horse. They are designated according\r\nto their relations to the vertebral column as =cervical= (8), =thoracic=\r\n(18), =lumbar= (6), =sacral= (5), and =coccygeal= (5). Each nerve is\r\nconnected with the spinal cord by two roots, dorsal and ventral (Fig.\r\n497).\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal= (or superior) =root= (Radix dorsalis) is the larger of the\r\ntwo. Its fibers (Fila radicularia) spread out in fan shape and join the\r\ncord in a linear series along the dorso-lateral groove. Laterally the\r\nfibers converge to form a compact bundle, on which is a gray nodular\r\nenlargement, the =spinal ganglion= (Ganglion spinale). Beyond the\r\nganglion the dorsal root joins the ventral root to constitute the nerve.\r\nThe ganglia are external to the dura mater, and are situated in the\r\nintervertebral foramina, except in the case of the sacral and coccygeal\r\nnerves, the ganglia of which lie within the vertebral canal. Those of\r\nthe coccygeal nerves are intradural.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The ganglia vary greatly in size; that of the first cervical nerve is\r\n  scarcely as large as a hemp seed, while that of the eighth cervical is\r\n  about 2 cm. long and 1 cm. wide. On the large roots connected with the\r\n  cervical and lumbar enlargement of the cord there are multiple ganglia\r\n  of varying sizes interposed in the course of the root-bundles. The\r\n  fibers of the dorsal roots arise from the cells of the spinal ganglia;\r\n  each cell gives off a fiber which enters the spinal cord and another\r\n  which passes into the nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =ventral= (or inferior) =root= (Radix ventralis) contains fewer\r\nfibers than the dorsal root, except in the case of the first cervical\r\nnerve. It arises from the ventral surface of the spinal cord (Fig. 495)\r\nby means of numerous small bundles of fibers which do not form a linear\r\nseries but emerge from the cord over an area three to five millimeters\r\nin width (ventral root zone). The fibers are processes of the large\r\ncells of the ventral gray columns of the spinal cord. There is no\r\nganglion on the ventral root.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the cervical, thoracic, and anterior lumbar regions the bundles of\r\n  both roots pass through separate openings in linear series in the dura\r\n  mater before uniting into a root proper. Further back the bundles of\r\n  each root unite within the dura. In the anterior part of the cervical\r\n  region and in the thoracic part of the cord there are intervals of\r\n  varying length between adjacent roots, but in some places the fibers\r\n  of adjacent roots overlap and an exchange of fibers may be observed.\r\n  Many of the roots are directed almost straight outward or incline\r\n  slightly backward, but the posterior lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal\r\n  roots and nerves run backward to reach the foramina through which they\r\n  emerge. The distance thus to be traversed increases from before\r\n  backward, so that these nerves form a tapering sheaf around the conus\r\n  medullaris and filum terminale in the last lumbar vertebra and the\r\n  sacrum which is known as the cauda equina.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 519.—VERTEBRAL CANAL OPENED BY SAWING OFF THE ARCHES. (After\r\n    Schmaltz. Atlas d. Anat. a. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =size= of the spinal nerves varies greatly. The largest are\r\nconnected with the cervical and lumbar enlargements.\r\n\r\nIn or immediately after its emergence from the intervertebral foramen\r\neach spinal nerve gives off a small =meningeal= or =recurrent branch=\r\n(Ramus meningeus). This is joined by a bundle of fibers from the ramus\r\ncommunicans and enters the vertebral canal, in which it is distributed.\r\nEach nerve then divides into two primary branches, =dorsal= and\r\n=ventral= (Ramus dorsalis, ventralis). The =dorsal branches= are smaller\r\nthan the ventral, except in the cervical region. They are distributed\r\nchiefly to the muscles and skin of the dorsal part of the body. The\r\n=ventral branches= supply in general the muscles and skin of the ventral\r\nparts of the body, including the limbs. Each nerve or its ventral branch\r\nis connected with an adjacent ganglion of the sympathetic system by at\r\nleast one small short branch known as a =ramus communicans=. Many nerves\r\nhave two and some have three such rami. A nerve may be connected with\r\ntwo ganglia, and a ganglion may be connected with two nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The dorsal root is sensory or afferent, _i. e._, it conveys impulses\r\n  to the central system. Its fibers are axones of the cells of the\r\n  spinal ganglion. The ventral root is motor or efferent, and conveys\r\n  impulses toward the periphery. Its fibers are axones of the large\r\n  cells in the ventral gray columns of the spinal cord. The common trunk\r\n  or nerve formed by the union of the two roots contains both kinds of\r\n  fibers, as do also their primary divisions. In addition to these\r\n  fibers, which are distributed to the skeletal muscles and the skin,\r\n  the spinal nerves contain fibers derived from the sympathetic system\r\n  through the rami communicantes; these go to the glands and unstriped\r\n  muscle and are designated secretory and vasomotor fibers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE CERVICAL NERVES\r\n\r\nThe =cervical nerves= (Nervi cervicales) (Figs. 431, 433, 518, 523)\r\nnumber eight pairs. Of these the first emerges through the\r\nintervertebral foramen of the atlas, the second through that of the\r\naxis, and the eighth between the last cervical and the first thoracic\r\nvertebræ.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal branches= are distributed to the dorso-lateral muscles and\r\nskin of the neck. They divide usually into inner and outer branches. The\r\ninternal branches (Rami mediales) run in general across the multifidus\r\nand the lamellar part of the ligamentum nuchæ to the skin of the upper\r\nborder of the neck; they supply the deep lateral muscles and the skin.\r\nThe external branches (Rami laterales) are chiefly muscular in their\r\ndistribution. The dorsal branches of the third to the sixth nerves are\r\nconnected by anastomotic branches to form the =dorsal cervical plexus=.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral branches= are smaller than the dorsal ones—an exception to\r\nthe general rule. They increase in size from first to last. They supply\r\nin general the muscles and skin over the lateral and ventral aspect of\r\nthe vertebræ, but the last three enter into the formation of the\r\nbrachial plexus, and the three preceding the last give off the roots of\r\nthe phrenic nerve. An irregular =ventral cervical plexus= is formed by\r\nanastomoses established between the ventral branches. The following\r\nspecial features may be noted:\r\n\r\nThe =first cervical nerve= emerges through the intervertebral\r\n(antero-internal) foramen of the atlas. Its =dorsal branch= (N.\r\noccipitalis) passes upward and outward between the obliqui capitis and\r\nthe recti capitis dorsales and supplies branches to these muscles, the\r\nscutularis and posterior auricular muscles, and the skin of the poll.\r\nThe =ventral branch= descends through the alar (antero-external) foramen\r\nof the atlas, crosses over the ventral straight muscles and the carotid\r\nartery under cover of the parotid gland, and divides into two branches.\r\nThe anterior branch enters the omo-hyoideus muscle. The posterior branch\r\npasses downward and backward under cover of that muscle, unites with a\r\nbranch of the ventral division of the second cervical nerve, and\r\ncontinues its course on the ventro-lateral surface of the trachea to\r\nenter the sterno-thyro-hyoideus behind the intermediate tendon. In the\r\nrecessus atlantis the ventral branch is connected by one or more twigs\r\nwith the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic, and a little\r\nlower with the hypoglossal nerve. It also sends branches to the ventral\r\nstraight muscles of the head and the thyro-hyoideus. Below the atlas the\r\nventral branch is crossed superficially by the spinal accessory nerve,\r\nthe occipital artery, and the inferior cerebral vein.\r\n\r\nThe =second cervical nerve= is larger than the first. It emerges from\r\nthe vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramen of the anterior\r\npart of the arch of the axis. Its =dorsal branch= ascends between the\r\ncomplexus and the ligamentum nuchæ and ramifies in the skin of the poll.\r\nThe =ventral branch= gives off =muscular branches= to the rectus capitis\r\nanterior major, and =anastomotic branches= to the spinal accessory and\r\nthe ventral divisions of the first and third cervical nerves; one of\r\nthese crosses over the carotid artery and concurs in the formation of\r\nthe nerve to the sterno-thyro-hyoideus mentioned above. The ventral\r\nbranch then becomes superficial by passing between the two parts of the\r\nmastoido-humeralis, and divides into posterior auricular and cutaneous\r\nbranches. The =posterior auricular nerve= passes upward and forward on\r\nthe parotid gland parallel with the posterior border of the\r\nparotido-auricularis to ramify on the convex face of the external ear.\r\nThe =cutaneous nerve= of the neck (N. cutaneus colli) crosses the\r\nmastoido-humeralis muscle and turns backward along the course of the\r\njugular vein. On the lower part of the parotid gland it is connected by\r\na twig with the cervical cutaneous branch of the facial nerve. It gives\r\noff twigs to the subcutaneous muscles and the skin of the parotid and\r\nlaryngeal regions and a long branch which passes forward in the\r\nsubmaxillary space.\r\n\r\nThe =third cervical nerve= leaves the vertebral canal through the\r\nforamen between the second and third cervical vertebræ. Its =dorsal\r\nbranch= emerges between two bundles of the intertransversalis muscle\r\naccompanied by a branch of the vertebral artery, turns upward on the\r\nmultifidus, and divides into several branches which radiate on the deep\r\nface of the complexus. It gives branches to these muscles and to the\r\nskin, and a twig which joins the corresponding branch of the fourth\r\nnerve. The =ventral branch= emerges through the intertransversalis below\r\nthe bundle above which the dorsal branch appears. It gives branches to\r\nthe trachelo-mastoideus, rectus capitis anterior major, longus colli,\r\nsplenius, and mastoido-humeralis. It also gives off a large cutaneous\r\nnerve which passes out between the two parts of the mastoido-humeralis\r\nand divides into several divergent branches.\r\n\r\nThe =fourth= and =fifth cervical nerves= are distributed in general like\r\nthe third. Their =dorsal branches= are united by anastomotic twigs with\r\neach other and with those of the third and sixth nerves to form the\r\ndorsal cervical plexus. The =ventral branch= of the fifth nerve often\r\ncontributes a small twig to the phrenic nerve.\r\n\r\nThe =sixth cervical nerve= has a smaller =dorsal branch= than the fifth.\r\nIts =ventral branch= is larger and goes in part to the brachial plexus;\r\nit supplies twigs to the intertransversales, the longus colli, the\r\nmastoido-humeralis, and the cervical parts of the serratus and\r\nrhomboideus, furnishes a root of the phrenic nerve, and gives off\r\nseveral considerable subcutaneous branches. One of the latter ramifies\r\non the thick part of the cervical panniculus, to which it gives\r\nbranches; another and larger branch (N. supraclavicularis) sends twigs\r\nto the skin over the shoulder joint, and descends to the skin over the\r\nsuperficial pectoral muscles (Fig. 466).\r\n\r\nThe =seventh= and =eighth cervical nerves= have small =dorsal branches=,\r\nwhich ascend between the longissimus and multifidus, giving twigs to\r\nthese muscles, the spinalis and semispinalis, the rhomboideus, and the\r\nskin. Their =ventral branches= are very large and concur in the\r\nformation of the brachial plexus; that of the seventh nerve contributes\r\nthe posterior root of the phrenic nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PHRENIC NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =phrenic nerve= (N. phrenicus) (Figs. 428, 429, 433), the motor\r\nnerve to the diaphragm, is formed by the union of two or three roots\r\nwhich cross the superficial face of the scalenus muscle obliquely\r\ndownward and backward. The chief roots come from the ventral branches of\r\nthe sixth and seventh cervical nerves. The root derived from the fifth\r\nnerve is small and inconstant. The root from the seventh cervical comes\r\nby way of the brachial plexus. The course of the nerve is not the same\r\non both sides. On the =right side= the nerve enters the thorax by\r\npassing between the brachial artery and the anterior vena cava. It then\r\ncourses backward and somewhat downward over the right face of the\r\nanterior vena cava, crosses the pericardium, and continues along the\r\nposterior vena cava to the diaphragm. In the latter part of its course\r\nit is inclosed in a special fold of the right pleura and inclines\r\ngradually to the ventral face of the vein. On the =left side= the nerve\r\nenters the thorax between the left brachial and inferior cervical\r\narteries, and then runs its entire course in the mediastinum. In the\r\nanterior mediastinum it lies along the brachiocephalic artery ventral to\r\nthe left vagus and cardiac nerves, and crosses over the dorso-cervical\r\nvein. It then passes over the upper part of the pericardium and runs\r\nbackward in the posterior mediastinum to reach the tendinous center of\r\nthe diaphragm considerably to the left of the median plane. Each nerve\r\nis usually connected near its origin with the first thoracic ganglion of\r\nthe sympathetic by a ramus communicans, and each terminates by dividing\r\ninto several branches which are distributed to the corresponding part of\r\nthe diaphragm.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS\r\n\r\nThe =brachial plexus= (Plexus brachialis) (Fig. 433) results from\r\nanastomoses established between the ventral branches of the last three\r\ncervical and first two thoracic nerves. It appears as a thick, wide band\r\nbetween the two parts of the scalenus muscle, and is covered by the\r\nanterior deep pectoral and subscapularis muscles. The largest root of\r\nthe plexus is derived from the first thoracic nerve, while the root\r\nsupplied by the sixth cervical nerve is quite small. Each of the three\r\nchief roots, _i. e._, those from the last two cervical and the first\r\nthoracic nerve, is connected with the sympathetic by a ramus\r\ncommunicans.\r\n\r\nThe =branches= emanating from the plexus go for the most part to the\r\nthoracic limb, but some are distributed on the chest-wall. The names of\r\nthe branches, and their arrangement so far as they can be conveniently\r\nexamined before removal of the fore limb, are as follows:[207]\r\n\r\n1. The large =suprascapular nerve= (N. suprascapularis) turns outward\r\nand forward and disappears between the supraspinatus and subscapularis.\r\n\r\n2. The much smaller =subscapular nerves= (Nn. subscapulares), usually\r\ntwo primary trunks, arise close behind the suprascapular, run backward a\r\nshort distance, and divide into several branches which enter the lower\r\nthird of the subscapularis.\r\n\r\n3. The =anterior thoracic= or =pectoral nerves= (N. pectorales\r\ncraniales), three or four in number, arise from the anterior part of the\r\nplexus and from the loop formed by the musculo-cutaneous and median\r\nnerves. One enters the anterior deep pectoral muscle. Another passes out\r\nbetween the divisions of the deep pectoral to supply the superficial\r\npectoral, giving a twig usually to the posterior deep muscle. The latter\r\nreceives one or two other nerves.\r\n\r\n4. The =musculo-cutaneous nerve= (N. musculocutaneus) arises from the\r\nanterior part of the plexus and passes over the outer face of the\r\nbrachial artery, below which it is connected by a large but short branch\r\nwith the median nerve, thus forming a loop in which the artery lies. One\r\nor two branches to the pectoral muscles are given off from the nerve or\r\nthe loop.\r\n\r\n5. The =median nerve= (N. medianus) is usually the largest branch of the\r\nbrachial plexus. It lies at first above the brachial artery, then passes\r\nbetween the artery and vein to reach the anterior border of the former.\r\nIt is easily recognized by its large size and the loop which it forms\r\nwith the musculo-cutaneous nerve.\r\n\r\n6. The =ulnar nerve= (N. ulnaris) arises with the median by a short\r\ncommon trunk. It descends behind the brachial artery and is accompanied\r\na short distance by the radial nerve.\r\n\r\n7. The =radial nerve= (N. radialis) arises from the posterior part of\r\nthe plexus and is sometimes the largest branch. It descends behind the\r\nulnar nerve over the origin of the subscapular artery and the lower part\r\nof the teres major, and dips into the interstice between that muscle and\r\nthe long and internal heads of the triceps.\r\n\r\n8. The =axillary= or =circumflex nerve= (N. axillaris) arises behind the\r\nmusculo-cutaneous. It passes downward and backward on the inner face of\r\nthe subscapularis and disappears between that muscle and the subscapular\r\nartery.\r\n\r\n9. The =long thoracic nerve= (N. thoracalis longus) is wide and thin. It\r\npasses backward across the surface of the serratus magnus, to which it\r\nis distributed. The branches which enter the muscle are given off both\r\nupward and downward in fairly regular fashion.\r\n\r\n10. The =thoraco-dorsal nerve= (N. thoracodorsalis) passes upward and\r\nbackward across the subscapularis muscle to ramify in the teres major\r\nand the latissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\n11. The =external= (or subcutaneous) =thoracic nerve= arises by a common\r\ntrunk with the ulnar. It runs backward and downward across the inner\r\nface of the tensor fasciæ antibrachii, communicates with the anterior\r\npectoral branches, and gives twigs to the deep pectoral muscle. It then\r\nruns backward in company with the external thoracic or “spur” vein,\r\ngives branches to the latissimus dorsi and the deep pectoral, and\r\nramifies in the panniculus and the skin of the abdominal wall. It\r\ncommunicates with perforating branches of the intercostal nerves. A\r\nbranch from it, accompanied by a large perforating intercostal branch,\r\nwinds around the lower border of the latissimus dorsi and ramifies in\r\nthe panniculus on the outer surface of the arm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The term posterior thoracic or pectoral nerves (Nn. pectorales\r\n  caudales) may be used to include 8, 9, and 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SUPRASCAPULAR NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =suprascapular= (Fig. 441) is a large nerve derived chiefly, if not\r\nexclusively, from the sixth and seventh cervical components of the\r\nbrachial plexus. It passes between the supraspinatus and subscapularis\r\nmuscles and turns around the distal fourth of the anterior border of the\r\nscapula to reach the supraspinous fossa. It gives branches to the\r\nsupraspinatus and continues backward and upward into the infraspinous\r\nfossa, where it supplies the infraspinatus, deltoid, and teres minor\r\nmuscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The direct relation of this nerve to the scapula renders it liable to\r\n  injury, the result of which may be paralysis and atrophy of the\r\n  muscles supplied by it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MUSCULO-CUTANEOUS NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =musculo-cutaneous nerve= (Fig. 441) arises close behind the\r\nsuprascapular, and is derived chiefly from the part of the brachial\r\nplexus which is supplied by the seventh and eighth cervical nerves. It\r\ndescends across the outer surface of the brachial artery, below which a\r\ngreat part of the nerve unites with the median to form the loop\r\npreviously mentioned. It gives off a branch which enters the upper part\r\nof the belly of the coraco-brachialis, passes downward and forward\r\nbetween the two parts of that muscle or between the muscle and the bone,\r\nand divides into branches which enter the biceps brachii. It contributes\r\none of the nerves to the pectoral muscles. In some cases this nerve\r\nsends a branch to join the cutaneous branch of the median.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AXILLARY NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =axillary nerve= (Figs. 441, 520), also termed the circumflex,\r\nderives its fibers from the eighth cervical and first thoracic roots of\r\nthe brachial plexus. It runs downward and backward across the lower part\r\nof the subscapularis and dips in between that muscle and the subscapular\r\nartery at the level of the shoulder joint. Continuing outward in the\r\ninterval between the teres minor and the long and external heads of the\r\ntriceps, it reaches the deep face of the deltoid and divides into\r\nseveral divergent branches. The =muscular branches= supply the teres\r\nmajor, capsularis, teres minor, infraspinatus, deltoid, and\r\nmastoido-humeralis. The =cutaneous branch= (N. cutaneus brachii\r\nlateralis) runs downward and a little forward across the external head\r\nof the triceps and ramifies on the fascia on the front of the forearm\r\nand on the superficial pectoral muscle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              RADIAL NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =radial nerve= (Figs. 441, 443, 520), also called the\r\nmusculo-spiral, is sometimes the largest branch of the brachial plexus.\r\nIts fibers are derived from the seventh and eighth cervical and first\r\nthoracic roots of the plexus. It passes downward and backward over the\r\ninner surface of the subscapular artery and the teres major. In this\r\npart of its course it is related in front to the ulnar nerve, which\r\nseparates it from the brachial vein. It detaches a branch to the tensor\r\nfasciæ antibrachii, passes outward in the interval between the teres\r\nmajor and the long and internal heads of the triceps, and gains the\r\nmusculo-spiral groove of the humerus. Accompanied by a branch of the\r\ndeep brachial artery, it runs obliquely downward and outward in the\r\ngroove, covered externally by the external head of the triceps and the\r\nextensor carpi radialis, and reaches the flexion surface of the elbow\r\njoint. In this part of its course it gives off a muscular branch which\r\nramifies in the long and external heads of the triceps and in the\r\nanconeus, and a =cutaneous nerve= (N. cutaneus antibrachii dorsalis);\r\nbranches of the latter emerge below or through the external head of the\r\ntriceps and ramify on the dorso-lateral surface of the forearm. At the\r\nelbow the nerve descends with the anterior radial vessels on the joint\r\ncapsule between the brachialis and extensor carpi radialis, and supplies\r\nbranches to the extensor carpi and the common or anterior extensor of\r\nthe digit and (inconstantly) to the brachialis. Below the elbow joint\r\nthe nerve detaches a large branch which passes back to the flexor carpi\r\nexternus, and terminates by small branches which descend on the radius\r\nto enter the radial and ulnar heads of the common extensor, the lateral\r\nextensor, and the oblique extensor of the carpus. Thus the radial nerve\r\ninnervates the extensors of the elbow, carpal and digital joints, and\r\nsupplies also the flexor carpi externus.[208]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 520.—CUTANEOUS NERVES OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF HORSE, EXTERNAL FACE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Cutaneous branch of axillary nerve; _b_, cutaneous branches of\r\n    radial nerve; _c_, posterior cutaneous branch of ulnar nerve; _d_,\r\n    cutaneous branch of median nerve; _e_, superficial branch of ulnar\r\n    nerve; _f_, external metacarpal nerve; _g_, anastomotic branch\r\n    connecting internal and external metacarpal nerves; _1_, external\r\n    head of triceps; _2_, extensor carpi radialis; _3_, anterior\r\n    extensor; _4_, flexor carpi externus.

It descends between the\r\nbrachial artery and vein, accompanied for a short distance by the radial\r\nnerve. It then crosses the vein and continues behind the latter along\r\nthe anterior border of the tensor fasciæ antibrachii and dips under that\r\nmuscle near the elbow. Here it is joined by the ulnar vessels and passes\r\ndownward and backward over the internal epicondyle of the humerus. In\r\nthe forearm it crosses obliquely the deep face of the ulnar head of the\r\nflexor carpi medius and descends under the deep fascia with the vessels,\r\nat first on the ulnar head of the perforans, and then between the middle\r\nand external flexors of the carpus. Near the level of the accessory\r\ncarpal bone it divides into two terminal branches, superficial and deep.\r\nIt gives off two principal collateral branches. The =cutaneous branch=\r\n(Ramus cutaneus palmaris) is detached just before the nerve passes under\r\nthe tensor fasciæ antibrachii; it runs downward and backward on that\r\nmuscle under cover of the posterior superficial pectoral, becomes\r\nsuperficial below the elbow and ramifies on the posterior surface and\r\nboth sides of the forearm. The =muscular branch= is given off at the\r\nelbow joint and divides to supply the flexors of the digit and the\r\nmiddle flexor of the carpus. Of the two terminals, the =superficial\r\nbranch= (Ramus superficialis) emerges between the tendons of insertion\r\nof the external and middle flexors of the carpus and ramifies on the\r\ndorso-lateral aspect of the carpus and metacarpus. The =deep branch=\r\n(Ramus profundus), after a very short course, unites under cover of the\r\ntendon of the flexor carpi medius with the outer branch of the median\r\nnerve to form the external metacarpal or volar nerve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 521.—CROSS-SECTION OF FOREARM OF HORSE ABOUT THREE INCHES (CA. 8\r\n    CM.)

It is\r\nusually the largest branch and it accompanies the chief arterial trunks\r\nto the distal part of the limb. It descends over the inner face of the\r\nbrachial artery, which it crosses obliquely, and continues down the arm\r\nin front of the artery. Near its origin it is joined by a large branch\r\nwith the musculo-cutaneous nerve, thus forming a loop in which the\r\nartery appears to be suspended. Near the elbow it crosses obliquely over\r\nthe artery (posterior radial) and lies behind it on the internal lateral\r\nligament. Below the joint it again crosses the artery and lies behind\r\nthe radius and the lower part of the long internal lateral ligament.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 522.—DISSECTION OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF HORSE,\r\n    VIEWED FROM BEHIND.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Lateral cartilage; _2_, _3_, _4_, ligaments from first phalanx to\r\n    third sesamoid, bulb of heel, and lateral cartilage. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the elbow the nerve is covered by the posterior superficial\r\n  pectoral muscle and is crossed by the large oblique connection between\r\n  the cephalic and brachial veins. The variable and often plexiform\r\n  venous arrangement renders approach to the nerve here undesirable. It\r\n  can be reached best by an incision just behind the lower part of the\r\n  long internal lateral ligament; here the nerve lies under the deep\r\n  fascia in the furrow between the radius and the anterior border of the\r\n  flexor carpi internus, overlapped by the latter. In some cases the\r\n  nerve retains its position in front of the artery at the elbow, and in\r\n  others it crosses the deep face of the artery.\r\n\r\n\r\nPassing beneath the internal flexor of the carpus, the nerve continues\r\ndownward in the forearm with the posterior radial vessels, and divides\r\nat a variable distance above the carpus into two branches; these are the\r\ninternal volar or metacarpal nerve and the branch which unites with the\r\nulnar to form the corresponding external nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the proximal part of the forearm the nerve runs almost straight\r\n  downward along the posterior border of the long internal lateral\r\n  ligament, while the artery here inclines somewhat backward. Thus the\r\n  nerve is superficial to the artery for a short distance, then lies in\r\n  front of the latter to about the middle of the region, where it\r\n  inclines a little backward and arrives at the interval between the\r\n  internal and middle flexors of the carpus. The division may occur\r\n  about the middle of the region, but commonly takes place in the distal\r\n  third or fourth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe collateral branches are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =musculo-cutaneous branch= is in reality the continuation of the\r\nnerve of that name. It is given off about the middle of the arm, passes\r\nbeneath the lower part of the biceps, and divides into muscular and\r\ncutaneous branches. The =muscular branch= enters the brachialis. The\r\n=cutaneous branch= emerges between the mastoido-humeralis and the biceps\r\nand divides into two branches; these descend on the fascia of the\r\nforearm with the cephalic vein and its accessory, and ramify on the\r\nfront and inner face of the forearm, carpus, and metacarpus.\r\n\r\n2. =Muscular branches= to the internal flexor of the carpus and the\r\nflexors of the digit are given off just as the nerve passes under the\r\nfirst named muscle.\r\n\r\n3. The very small =interosseous nerve= passes through the interosseous\r\nspace and is distributed chiefly to the periosteum, but in some cases\r\ntwigs may go to the extensor muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =metacarpal= or =volar nerves=,[209] internal and external, are the\r\ncontinuations of the median and ulnar nerves in the distal part of the\r\nlimb.\r\n\r\nThe =internal metacarpal= or =volar nerve= (N. volaris medialis) arises\r\nas the inner terminal branch of the median nerve at a variable distance\r\nabove the carpus (Fig. 442). It descends through the carpal canal along\r\nthe inner border of the superficial flexor tendon, and lies at first in\r\nfront of the large metacarpal or common digital artery. It then passes\r\nbehind the artery to the distal third of the metacarpus, where it lies\r\nbehind the vein, the artery here becoming deeper in position. In\r\naddition to cutaneous twigs, the nerve gives off about the middle of the\r\nmetacarpus a considerable =anastomotic branch= which winds obliquely\r\ndownward and outward over the flexor tendons and joins the external\r\nnerve at the lower third of the metacarpus (Fig. 447). Near the fetlock\r\nthe nerve divides into two digital branches.\r\n\r\n1. The =dorsal= or =anterior digital branch= (Ramus dorsalis) descends\r\nat first between the digital artery and vein, then crosses over the vein\r\nand ramifies in the skin and the matrix of the hoof on the dorsal\r\n(anterior) face of the digit.\r\n\r\n2. The =volar= or =posterior digital branch= (Ramus volaris) is the\r\ndirect continuation of the trunk. It descends behind the digital artery,\r\nwhich it accompanies in its ramification. A =middle digital branch= is\r\nsometimes described as descending behind the vein. In some cases this\r\nbranch is distinct, but usually there are instead several small twigs\r\nderived from the posterior branch, which cross very obliquely over the\r\nartery and anastomose in a variable manner with each other and with the\r\nanterior branch.\r\n\r\nThe =external metacarpal= or =velar nerve= (N. volaris lateralis) is\r\nformed by the union of the external terminal branch of the median with\r\nthe deep branch of the ulnar nerve (Fig. 442). It descends with the\r\ninternal volar or small metacarpal artery in the texture of the\r\nposterior annular ligament of the carpus. In the metacarpus it descends\r\nalong the outer border of the deep flexor tendon behind the external\r\nmetacarpal vein, and is accompanied by a small artery from the volar\r\nsubcarpal arch. Toward the distal end of the metacarpus it is joined by\r\nthe oblique branch from the internal nerve, and beyond this is arranged\r\nlike the latter. Below the carpus it detaches a deep branch to the\r\nsuspensory ligament and the interossei, and also supplies twigs to the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Anastomoses are established between the digital branches, and the\r\n  areas innervated by them are not well defined, but really overlap each\r\n  other. In certain diseased conditions, however, in which the lesions\r\n  are confined to the volar structures, relief from pain may be afforded\r\n  by section of the volar branches only.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE THORACIC NERVES\r\n\r\nThe =thoracic nerves= (Nn. thoracales) number eighteen on either side in\r\nthe horse. They are designated numerically according to the vertebræ\r\nbehind which they emerge. Most of them are arranged in a very similar\r\nmanner and therefore do not require separate description. Each divides\r\ninto a dorsal and a ventral branch, the latter being the larger.\r\n\r\nThe =dorsal branches= (Rami dorsales) emerge behind the levatores\r\ncostarum and divide into internal and external branches. The internal\r\nbranches ascend on the multifidus and supply the dorsal spinal muscles.\r\nThe external branches run outward under the longissimus and emerge\r\nbetween that muscle and the transversalis costarum; after giving twigs\r\nto these muscles they pass through the latissimus dorsi and the\r\nlumbo-dorsal fascia and ramify as dorsal cutaneous nerves under the skin\r\nof the back (Fig. 523). In the region of the withers they give branches\r\nto the serratus anticus and rhomboideus, and their cutaneous terminals\r\npass through these muscles and the dorso-scapular ligament to supply the\r\nskin over the ligamentum nuchæ and the scapular cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral branches= or =intercostal nerves= (Nn. intercostales) are\r\nmuch larger than the preceding, and are connected with the sympathetic\r\nby rami communicantes. The first goes almost entirely to the brachial\r\nplexus, but sends a fine branch downward in the first intercostal space\r\nwhich is expended in the muscle there without reaching the lower end of\r\nthe space. The second ventral branch furnishes a considerable root to\r\nthe brachial plexus, but its intercostal continuation is typical. The\r\nintercostal nerves (Fig. 184) descend in the intercostal spaces with the\r\nvessels of like name, at first between the intercostal muscles, and\r\nlower down chiefly between the pleura and the internal intercostal\r\nmuscle. In the anterior spaces the artery lies along the posterior\r\nborder of the rib, with the nerve in front of it; further back the nerve\r\nlies behind the border of the rib, with the artery in front of it. They\r\nsupply the intercostal muscles, give off lateral perforating branches,\r\nand terminate in the following manner: The second to the sixth inclusive\r\nemerge through the spaces between the costal cartilages and concur in\r\nsupplying the pectoral muscles. The second to the eighth give branches\r\nto the transversus thoracis. The succeeding ones give branches to the\r\ndiaphragm, pass between the transverse and internal oblique muscles,\r\ngive twigs to these, and end in the rectus abdominis. There are three\r\nseries of cutaneous nerves given off by the intercostal nerves. The\r\nupper nerves emerge through the serratus magnus and the external\r\nintercostals about parallel with the digitations of the external\r\noblique. The middle set perforate the origin of the latter muscle. The\r\nlower ones appear through the abdominal tunic. They supply branches to\r\nthe abdominal muscles, the panniculus, and the skin. Some of the\r\nanterior ones anastomose with the posterior thoracic branches of the\r\nbrachial plexus. The posterior three supply in part the skin of the\r\nflank. The ventral branch of the last thoracic nerve runs outward behind\r\nthe last rib across the dorsal surface of the psoas major and divides\r\ninto superficial and deep branches. The superficial branch passes\r\nbetween the obliquus internus and transversus abdominis, perforates the\r\nobliquus externus, and ramifies under the skin of the flank (Fig. 525).\r\nThe deep branch descends on the inner face of the internal oblique to\r\nthe rectus abdominis, in which it ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE LUMBAR NERVES\r\n\r\nThere are six pairs of =lumbar nerves= (Nn. lumbales) in the horse, the\r\nlast of which emerge between the last lumbar vertebra and the sacrum.\r\nThe anterior two or three are about the same size as the thoracic\r\nnerves, but the others are much larger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 523.—SUPERFICIAL NERVES OF NECK AND TRUNK OF HORSE. (After\r\n    Schmaltz, Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nTheir =dorsal branches= are small in comparison with the ventral ones.\r\nThey are distributed to the muscles and skin of the loins and croup in a\r\nfashion similar to those of the thoracic nerves.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral branches= are connected with the sympathetic by small rami\r\ncommunicantes, and give branches to the sublumbar muscles. Those of the\r\nfirst two nerves are arranged in a manner analogous to the corresponding\r\nbranch of the last thoracic nerve.\r\n\r\nThe ventral branch of the =first lumbar nerve= is termed the\r\n=ilio-hypogastric nerve= (N. iliohypogastricus). It passes outward\r\nbetween the quadratus lumborum and the psoas major, and divides at the\r\nouter border of the latter into an anterior or superficial and a\r\nposterior or deep branch. The =anterior= or =superficial branch= passes\r\nover the upper edge of the internal oblique, descends between that\r\nmuscle and the external oblique, perforates the latter, and runs\r\ndownward and backward and ramifies under the skin of the posterior part\r\nof the flank and the outer surface of the thigh. It gives branches to\r\nthe transversus and obliquus externus abdominis. The =posterior= or\r\n=deep branch= is smaller; it runs downward and backward beneath the\r\nperitoneum to the outer border of the rectus abdominis, gives branches\r\nto the internal oblique, and terminates in the rectus abdominis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 524.—LUMBAR NERVES OF HORSE, VENTRAL VIEW. (After Schmaltz, Atlas\r\n    d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe ventral branch of the =second lumbar nerve= is connected by an\r\nanastomotic branch with that of the third nerve. It gives off a large\r\nbranch to the psoas muscle and an inguinal branch, and is continued as\r\nthe ilio-inguinal nerve. The =inguinal branch= (N. spermaticus externus)\r\nruns backward in the substance of the psoas minor, emerges a short\r\ndistance in front of the circumflex iliac vessels, and runs backward and\r\ndownward under the peritoneum to the internal inguinal ring. It gives\r\nbranches to the internal oblique muscle and descends in the inguinal\r\ncanal along the outer border of the cremaster (to which it detaches\r\nfilaments) and ends subcutaneously in the scrotum and prepuce in the\r\nmale, the mammary gland in the female. The =ilio-inguinal nerve= (N.\r\nilioinguinalis) may be regarded as the continuation of the ventral\r\nbranch. It runs parallel with the ilio-hypogastric nerve and has a\r\nsimilar arrangement. Its =anterior= or =superficial branch= perforates\r\nthe external oblique muscle a little in front of the point of the hip,\r\nruns downward on the front of the thigh and the outer surface of the\r\nstifle, and gives off cutaneous branches. The =posterior= or =deep\r\nbranch= runs behind and parallel with that of the iliohypogastricus,\r\ndetaches branches to the internal oblique muscle, and descends the\r\ninguinal canal with the inguinal branch, to be distributed to the\r\nexternal genital organs and the surrounding skin in the inguinal region.\r\n\r\nThe ventral branch of the =third lumbar nerve= is connected by a small\r\nanastomotic branch with the second nerve and furnishes a root of the\r\nlumbo-sacral plexus. It gives off a branch to the psoas muscles, an\r\ninguinal branch, and is continued as the external cutaneous nerve. The\r\n=inguinal branch= (N. spermaticus externus) passes backward in the\r\nsubstance of the psoas minor, from which it emerges under cover of or\r\nnear the circumflex iliac vessels. It then runs external to and parallel\r\nwith the external iliac artery and descends in the inner part of the\r\ninguinal canal. It emerges at the external ring with the external pudic\r\nartery and ramifies in the external genital organs and the skin of the\r\ninguinal region. The =external cutaneous nerve= of the thigh (N.\r\ncutaneus femoris lateralis) runs backward in the substance of the psoas\r\nmuscles and emerges at the outer border of the psoas minor. It then\r\npasses outward and backward on the iliac fascia and accompanies the\r\nposterior branch of the circumflex iliac artery. With this vessel it\r\nperforates the abdominal wall by passing between the external oblique\r\nand the iliacus a short distance below the point of the hip, and\r\ndescends on the inner face of the tensor fasciæ latæ (near its anterior\r\nborder) and ramifies subcutaneously in the region of the stifle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 525.—SUPERFICIAL NERVES OF PELVIC LIMB AND POSTERIOR PART OF\r\n    TRUNK OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Cutaneous branches of sixteenth and seventeenth thoracic nerves;\r\n    _b_, cutaneous branches of lumbar nerves; _c_, cutaneous branches of\r\n    sacral nerves; _d_, cutaneous branches of coccygeal nerves; _e_,\r\n    _f_, _g_, cutaneous branches of last intercostal, ilio-hypogastric,\r\n    and ilio-inguinal nerves; _g′_, end of external cutaneous nerve of\r\n    thigh; _h_, posterior cutaneous nerve of thigh; _i_, _i_, cutaneous\r\n    branches of great sciatic nerve; _k_, posterior cutaneous nerve of\r\n    the leg; _l_, superficial peroneal nerve; _m_, terminal part of deep\r\n    peroneal nerve; _n_, external plantar nerve; _1_, obliquus abdominis\r\n    externus; _2_, tensor fasciæ latæ; _3_, gluteus superficialis; _4_,\r\n    biceps femoris; _5_, semitendinosus; _6_, anterior extensor; _7_,\r\n    lateral extensor; _8_, flexor tendons; _9_, great metatarsal artery.\r\n    (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The origin and disposition of some of the foregoing nerves are\r\n  variable. In some cases the ilio-inguinal nerve ends in the psoas\r\n  major, and appears then to be absent. The mode of formation of the\r\n  inguinal nerves is very inconstant. The inner nerve may arise with one\r\n  of the outer ones from a common trunk, or they may anastomose. The\r\n  inguinal branch of the ilio-inguinal nerve often receives a twig from\r\n  the ilio-hypogastric nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ventral branches of the =fourth=, =fifth=, and =sixth lumbar= nerves\r\nconcur in the formation of the lumbo-sacral plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LUMBO-SACRAL PLEXUS\r\n\r\nThis plexus (Fig. 451) results substantially from the union of the\r\nventral branches of the last three lumbar and the first two sacral\r\nnerves, but it derives a small root from the third lumbar nerve also.\r\nThe anterior part of the plexus lies in front of the internal iliac\r\nartery between the lumbar transverse processes and the psoas minor. The\r\nposterior part lies partly upon and partly in the texture of the\r\nsacro-sciatic ligament. From the plexus are derived the nerves of the\r\npelvic limb, which are now to be described.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             FEMORAL NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =femoral= (or anterior crural) nerve (N. femoralis) is derived\r\nchiefly from the fourth and fifth lumbar nerves, but commonly receives a\r\nfasciculus from the third nerve also (Fig. 524). It is the larger of the\r\ntwo nerves which are given off from the anterior part of the\r\nlumbo-sacral plexus. It runs backward at first between the psoas major\r\nand minor, then crosses the deep face of the tendon of insertion of the\r\nlatter, and descends under cover of the sartorius in the furrow between\r\nthe two heads of the iliacus. It gives off the saphenous nerve, crosses\r\nthe lower part of the outer head of the iliacus, and divides into\r\nseveral branches which dip into the interstice between the rectus\r\nfemoris and the vastus internus (Fig. 450). These branches are\r\naccompanied by the anterior femoral vessels and innervate the quadriceps\r\nfemoris. Collateral muscular branches are supplied to the ilio-psoas and\r\nsartorius.\r\n\r\nThe =saphenous nerve= (N. saphenus) (Figs. 450, 451, 457) is given off\r\nas the parent trunk crosses the furrow between the psoas major and the\r\nouter head of the iliacus. It descends with the femoral vessels in the\r\nfemoral canal, and gives branches to the sartorius, gracilis, and\r\npectineus. About the middle of the thigh it divides into several\r\nbranches which emerge from between the sartorius and gracilis, perforate\r\nthe deep fascia and ramify on the inner surface and the front of the\r\nlimb as far downward as the hock. The longer posterior branches\r\naccompany the saphenous vessels, while the anterior branches deviate\r\nforward toward the stifle and the anterior surface of the leg.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            OBTURATOR NERVE\r\n\r\nThis nerve (N. obturatorius) is derived from the ventral branches of the\r\nlast three lumbar nerves (Fig. 524). It runs downward and backward, at\r\nfirst above and then upon the external iliac vein, inclines inward\r\nacross the obturator vein, and passes through the anterior part of the\r\nobturator foramen in front of that vessel (Fig. 451). It continues\r\ndownward through the obturator externus, and divides into several\r\nbranches which innervate the obturator externus, pectineus, adductor,\r\nand gracilis muscles (Fig. 456).\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ANTERIOR GLUTEAL NERVE\r\n\r\nThis nerve (N. glutæus cranialis) is derived chiefly from the last\r\nlumbar and first sacral nerves. It divides into four or five branches\r\nwhich emerge through the great sacro-sciatic foramen with the divisions\r\nof the anterior gluteal artery and supply the gluteal and tensor fasciæ\r\nlatæ muscles. The nerve to the latter and the anterior part of the\r\nsuperficial gluteus passes between the deep part of the gluteus medius\r\nand the deep gluteal muscle, and is accompanied on the iliacus by\r\nbranches of the external circumflex vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        POSTERIOR GLUTEAL NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =posterior gluteal nerve= (N. glutæus caudalis) is derived mainly\r\nfrom the sacral roots of the lumbo-sacral plexus (Figs. 451, 526). It\r\ndivides into two trunks which emerge above the great sciatic nerve. The\r\nupper nerve passes backward on the sacro-sciatic ligament and divides\r\ninto branches which enter the two heads of the biceps femoris; it\r\nsupplies a branch to the posterior part of the middle gluteus, and a\r\nnerve which turns around the posterior border of the latter and enters\r\nthe posterior head of the superficial gluteus. The inferior nerve runs\r\ndownward and backward on the sacro-sciatic ligament and divides into the\r\n=posterior cutaneous nerve= and muscular branches which supply the\r\nsemitendinosus. The former (N. cutaneus femoris caudalis) passes through\r\nthe biceps femoris, emerges between that muscle and the semitendinosus a\r\nlittle below the level of the tuber ischii, and ramifies subcutaneously\r\non the outer and posterior surfaces of the hip and thigh (Fig. 525).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 526.—VESSELS AND NERVES OF PELVIC WALL OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  Nervus ischiadicus = great sciatic nerve; n. glut. inf = anterior\r\n    gluteal nerve; n. pudendus = internal pudic nerve. (After Schmaltz,\r\n    Atlas d. Anat. D. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GREAT SCIATIC NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =great sciatic nerve= (N. ischiadicus) (Figs. 451, 455, 526), the\r\nlargest in the body, is derived chiefly from the last lumbar and the\r\nsacral roots of the lumbo-sacral plexus, but may receive a fasciculus\r\nfrom the third sacral nerve also. It emerges through the great\r\nsacro-sciatic foramen as a broad flat band—blended at first with the\r\nposterior gluteal nerve—which passes downward and backward on the lower\r\npart of the sacro-sciatic ligament and on the origin of the deep gluteus\r\nmuscle. It turns downward in the hollow between the trochanter major and\r\nthe tuber ischii over the gemellus, the tendon of the obturator\r\ninternus, and the quadratus femoris. In its descent in the thigh it lies\r\nbetween the biceps femoris externally and the adductor, semimembranosus,\r\nand semitendinosus internally, and it is continued between the two heads\r\nof the gastrocnemius as the tibial nerve. Its chief branches are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. In the pelvic part of its course the sciatic nerve supplies small\r\nbranches to the obturator internus, gemellus, and quadratus femoris; the\r\nbranch to the obturator internus reaches the muscle by passing through\r\nthe anterior end of the lesser sacro-sciatic foramen.\r\n\r\n2. As the sciatic nerve turns down behind the hip joint it gives off a\r\nlarge branch (Ramus muscularis proximalis) which divides to supply the\r\nsemimembranosus and the short heads of the biceps femoris and\r\nsemitendinosus.\r\n\r\n3. The =posterior cutaneous nerve= of the leg or =external saphenous\r\nnerve= (N. cutaneus suræ posterior) is detached from the sciatic about\r\nthe middle of the thigh. It receives a fasciculus from the peroneal\r\nnerve and descends with the recurrent tarsal vein on the outer face of\r\nthe gastrocnemius to the distal third of the leg. Here it perforates the\r\ndeep fascia and ramifies under the skin on the outer surface of the\r\ntarsus and metatarsus (Fig. 525).\r\n\r\n4. The =peroneal= or =external popliteal nerve= (N. peronæus) (Figs.\r\n455, 460, 527) is a large trunk which arises from the great sciatic\r\nnerve very shortly after the latter emerges from the pelvic cavity. It\r\ndescends with the parent trunk to the origin of the gastrocnemius; here\r\nthe peroneal nerve deviates outward and forward across the external face\r\nof the gastrocnemius under cover of the biceps femoris, and divides at\r\nthe origin of the lateral extensor muscle into superficial and deep\r\nbranches. The collateral branches include a twig to the biceps femoris,\r\nthe reinforcing fasciculus detached about the middle of the thigh to the\r\nposterior cutaneous nerve, and, lower down, the =external cutaneous\r\nnerve= of the leg (Ramus cutaneus suræ lateralis). The latter, also\r\nknown as the peroneal cutaneous nerve, emerges between the middle and\r\nposterior divisions of the biceps femoris at the level of the stifle\r\njoint and ramifies under the skin. The =superficial peroneal= or\r\n=musculo-cutaneous nerve= (N. peronæus superficialis) furnishes branches\r\nto the lateral extensor, and descends in the furrow between that muscle\r\nand the anterior extensor, perforates the deep fascia of the leg, and\r\nramifies under the skin on the front and the outer face of the tarsus\r\nand metatarsus. The =deep peroneal= or =anterior tibial nerve= (N.\r\nperonæus profundus) is the direct continuation in point of size of the\r\nperoneal trunk. It dips in between the lateral and anterior extensors of\r\nthe digit, gives branches to these muscles and the tibialis anterior,\r\nand descends in front of the intermuscular septum which separates the\r\nformer. It continues downward behind the tendon of the anterior extensor\r\nand divides on the front of the hock into internal and external\r\nbranches. The =internal branch= (Ramus medialis) passes down under the\r\nskin on the anterior face of the metatarsus and supplies the cutaneous\r\nfibers of this region. The =external branch= (Ramus lateralis) furnishes\r\na twig to the extensor brevis muscle and descends with the great\r\nmetatarsal artery. It supplies the skin on the outer face of the\r\nmetatarsus and the fetlock.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the greater part of its course in the leg the deep peroneal nerve\r\n  is separated from the anterior tibial vessels by the tibialis anterior\r\n  (muscular part of the flexor metatarsi). It should be noted that the\r\n  outer of the two veins which almost always accompany the artery here\r\n  is frequently very large, and the layer of muscle which intervenes\r\n  between it and the nerve is often exceedingly thin. In the distal part\r\n  of the leg the nerve is in direct contact with the vein, and on the\r\n  front of the hock it lies behind the vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TIBIAL NERVE\r\n\r\nThe =tibial nerve= (N. tibialis), also termed the posterior tibial, is\r\nthe direct continuation of the great sciatic nerve (Figs. 451, 455, 458,\r\n459, 527). It passes down between the two heads of the gastrocnemius,\r\nand accompanies the recurrent tibial vessels to the distal third of the\r\nleg, where it divides into internal and external plantar nerves. In the\r\nupper third of the leg it lies along the inner side of the superficial\r\nflexor under cover of the internal head of the gastrocnemius; lower down\r\nit is covered by the common deep fascia and is situated in the space\r\nbetween the deep flexor and the inner border of the tendo Achillis.\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the usual point of election for tibial neurectomy, _i. e._, about a\r\n  handbreadth above the level of the tuber calcis, the nerve lies in\r\n  areolar tissue and fat in a fascial compartment formed by the special\r\n  fascia of the deep flexor in front and by the common fascia and the\r\n  accessory or tarsal tendon of the semitendinosus and biceps femoris\r\n  behind and internally.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt its origin the tibial nerve gives off a =muscular branch= (Ramus\r\nmuscularis distalis), the divisions of which pass between the two heads\r\nof the gastrocnemius and radiate to supply that muscle, the popliteus,\r\nthe soleus, and the flexors of the digit. Small cutaneous twigs are also\r\ndetached along the course of the nerve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 527.—CROSS-SECTION OF DISTAL THIRD OF LEFT LEG OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The deep fascia is shown by red line.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PLANTAR NERVES\r\n\r\nThe =plantar nerves=, internal and external (N. plantaris medialis,\r\nlateralis), result from the bifurcation of the tibial nerve in the lower\r\npart of the leg (Figs. 458, 459). They continue at first in the same\r\ndirection and relations as the parent trunk, in direct apposition and\r\ninclosed in a common sheath. At the hock they diverge at a very acute\r\nangle and descend in the tarsal canal behind the deep flexor tendon in\r\ncompany with the plantar arteries. The internal plantar nerve supplies\r\ncutaneous nerves to the inner aspect of the tarsus and metatarsus,\r\ndescends along the inner border of the flexor tendons behind the\r\nsuperficial plantar metatarsal vessels, and is otherwise arranged like\r\nthe corresponding volar nerve of the fore limb. The external plantar\r\nnerve deviates outward between the two flexor tendons to reach their\r\nouter border. It supplies a branch to the suspensory ligament, and in\r\nits further course resembles the corresponding nerve of the fore limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In so-called “tibial” neurectomy the operator really cuts the two\r\n  plantar nerves which have not yet separated. The anastomotic branch\r\n  between the two plantar nerves is smaller than that which connects the\r\n  corresponding nerves of the fore limb, and is absent in 30 per cent.\r\n  of the cases, according to Rudert.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SACRAL NERVES\r\n\r\nFive pairs of =sacral nerves= (Nn. sacrales) are present in the horse.\r\n\r\nThe small =dorsal branches= emerge through the dorsal sacral foramina\r\nand the space between the sacrum and the first coccygeal vertebra, and\r\nramify in the muscles and skin of the sacral region and the adjacent\r\npart of the tail (Fig. 525). The fifth anastomoses with the dorsal\r\nbranch of the first coccygeal nerve.\r\n\r\nThe =ventral branches= leave the vertebral canal through the ventral\r\nsacral foramina and the interval between the sacrum and first coccygeal\r\nvertebra. They are connected with the sympathetic by rami communicantes,\r\nand contribute branches to the pelvic plexus. The first and second are\r\nthe largest, and unite with each other and with those of the last three\r\nlumbar nerves to form the lumbo-sacral plexus. The third and fourth are\r\nconnected with each other, and the majority of their fibers go to form\r\nthe pudic and posterior hæmorrhoidal nerves.\r\n\r\nThe =pudic nerve= (N. pudendus) (Figs. 451, 455, 526) accompanies the\r\ninternal pudic artery to the ischial arch, turns around the latter,\r\nparting company with the artery, and pursues a flexuous course along the\r\ndorsum penis as the =nervus dorsalis penis= and ramifies in the glans\r\nand the penile layer of the prepuce. Within the pelvis it anastomoses\r\nwith the posterior hæmorrhoidal nerve, and gives branches to the bladder\r\nand urethra, the terminal part of the rectum, and the skin and muscles\r\nof the anus (Fig. 452). It also supplies the nerve to the\r\nischio-cavernosus muscle and numerous branches to the corpus cavernosum\r\nand corpus spongiosum. In the female it terminates in the clitoris and\r\nvulva (Fig. 453).\r\n\r\nThe =posterior hæmorrhoidal nerve= (N. hæmorrhoidalis caudalis) passes\r\ndownward and backward above the pudic nerve, with which it anastomoses.\r\nIt gives twigs to the terminal part of the rectum, the sphincter ani\r\nexternus, and the surrounding skin (Fig. 452). In the female it supplies\r\ntwigs to the vulva also (Fig. 453).\r\n\r\nThe ventral branch of the fifth nerve is small. It gives twigs to the\r\nsacro-coccygeus ventralis lateralis and the skin of the root of the tail\r\nand joins the first coccygeal nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            COCCYGEAL NERVES\r\n\r\nThe =coccygeal nerves= (Nn. coccygei) commonly number five pairs. Their\r\ndorsal and ventral branches anastomose to form respectively two trunks\r\non either side, which extend to the tip of the tail and supply its\r\nmuscular and cutaneous nerves. The dorsal trunk runs with the\r\ndorso-lateral artery between the sacro-coccygeus dorsalis and\r\nintertransversales muscles (Fig. 454). The ventral trunk accompanies the\r\nventro-lateral artery below the intertransversales.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM[210]\r\n\r\nThe =sympathetic nervous system= (Systema nervorum sympathicum) is that\r\npart of the nervous system which serves (1) to transmit stimuli to the\r\nheart-muscle, unstriped muscle, and glands; (2) to conduct impulses from\r\nthe viscera to the cerebrospinal system.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Many of the fibers are derived from the cerebrospinal system and are\r\n  rearranged and distributed in the sympathetic system. Numerous\r\n  sympathetic fibers are contributed to the cerebrospinal nerves,\r\n  through which they are distributed to the unstriped muscular tissue\r\n  and glands, as vasomotor, pilomotor, and secretory nerves. The\r\n  sympathetic, like the cerebrospinal system, consists of neurones, each\r\n  of which comprises the cell-body, an axone, and numerous branched\r\n  dendrites. The cell-bodies are aggregated into =ganglia=, some of\r\n  which are large and more or less constant in position and form, while\r\n  others are microscopic; and are scattered in an irregular manner\r\n  through the peripheral part of the system. It is probable that simple\r\n  visceral reflexes may be mediated by sympathetic neurones alone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn descriptive anatomy the sympathetic system is regarded as consisting\r\nof (1) a chain of =ganglia= extending along either side of the vertebral\r\ncolumn and connected by association fibers to form the =sympathetic\r\ntrunk=; (2) =central branches= to and from the cerebrospinal nerves; (3)\r\n=peripheral branches=, which form =plexuses= with each other and the\r\ncerebrospinal nerves; (4) the =peripheral ganglia= which are interposed\r\nin the plexuses.\r\n\r\nThe =sympathetic trunk= (Truncus sympathicus) extends on either side\r\nfrom the base of the cranium to the tail. In it are interposed, at\r\nintervals of varying regularity, the =ganglia of the sympathetic trunk=\r\n(Ganglia trunci sympathici). These are connected with the cerebrospinal\r\nnerves by central branches, the =rami communicantes=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Two kinds of rami communicantes occur. Of these, one type consists\r\n  largely of medullated fibers derived from the spinal nerves and\r\n  ganglia; they have therefore a white appearance, and are termed =white\r\n  rami=. They contain both efferent and afferent fibers. The =efferent\r\n  splanchnic fibers= are derived from the ventral roots of the spinal\r\n  nerves and terminate in great part about the cells of the nearest\r\n  sympathetic ganglion; others end in more distant or in peripheral\r\n  ganglia. The =afferent splanchnic fibers= are chiefly peripheral\r\n  processes of the cells of the spinal ganglia, but some are sympathetic\r\n  fibers which enter the spinal nerve-trunk and terminate about cells of\r\n  the spinal ganglion. The =gray rami= consist mainly of non-medullated\r\n  fibers derived from the sympathetic ganglia directly or through the\r\n  trunk, which proceed centrally to the spinal nerves and are\r\n  distributed along the somatic divisions of the latter to unstriped\r\n  muscle and glands as =vasomotor=, =pilomotor=, and =secretory fibers=.\r\n  Some go to the membranes of the spinal cord, and a few terminate about\r\n  cells of the spinal ganglia as sensory sympathetic fibers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar but more complex and irregular communications which exist\r\nbetween the sympathetic system and the cranial nerves—with the exception\r\nof the first and second—have been referred to in the accounts of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient for descriptive purposes to divide the sympathetic\r\nsystem into cephalic, cervical, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic parts.\r\n\r\n1. The =cephalic part= (Pars cephalica systematis sympathici) comprises\r\nthe =otic=, =sphenopalatine=, and =ciliary ganglia=, which may be\r\nregarded as homologues of the ganglia of the trunk of other regions. It\r\nalso includes three plexuses formed by branches derived from the\r\nsuperior cervical ganglion. The ganglion gives off two or three\r\nfilaments which subdivide to form the =internal carotid plexus= around\r\nthe artery of like name. The =cavernous plexus= surrounds the artery\r\nwithin the cavernous sinus and communicates with that of the opposite\r\nside. The =external carotid plexus= is formed around the homonymous\r\nartery, and filaments from it go to the vessel and its branches and to\r\nthe salivary glands.\r\n\r\n2. The =cervical part= (Pars cervicalis s. sympathici) includes two\r\nganglia and the trunk which connects them.\r\n\r\nThe =superior= or =anterior cervical ganglion= (G. cervicale craniale)\r\nlies on the guttural pouch below the occipito-atlantal articulation\r\n(Fig. 437). It is reddish-gray in color, fusiform, and about an inch\r\n(ca. 2 to 3 cm.) in length. It is connected by rami communicantes with\r\nthe last four cranial and first cervical nerves, sends branches to form\r\nthe plexuses mentioned above, and contributes to the pharyngeal plexus.\r\n\r\nThe =cervical trunk= of the sympathetic connects the superior and\r\ninferior cervical ganglia. On leaving the former it is associated in a\r\ncommon sheath with the vagus along the dorsal face of the common carotid\r\nartery. At the root of the neck it separates from the vagus and joins\r\nthe inferior ganglion.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior= or =posterior cervical ganglion= (G. cervicale caudale)\r\nis situated under the first rib and the insertion of the scalenus (Figs.\r\n428, 429). On the right side it lies upon the longus colli and the\r\ntrachea, on the left side upon the same muscle and the œsophagus. It is\r\nflattened, very irregular and variable in outline, and is blended more\r\nor less with the first thoracic ganglion. It is connected by large gray\r\nrami with the ventral branches of the last two cervical nerves, and by\r\nsmall filaments with the recurrent nerve. It receives a nerve—termed by\r\nSchmaltz the nervus transversarius—which accompanies the vertebral\r\nartery; through it rami come from the second to the sixth cervical\r\nnerves inclusive.\r\n\r\nA =middle cervical ganglion= may be present, and occurs oftenest on the\r\nright side. It lies on the carotid artery an inch or two in front of the\r\nfirst rib and is intercalated in the vago-sympathetic trunk.\r\n\r\nThe =cardiac nerves= (Nn. cardiaci) are formed by branches from the\r\ninferior cervical and first thoracic ganglia, together with twigs from\r\nthe sympathetic trunks and the vagi. They form a plexus (P. cardiacus)\r\non the ventral face of the trachea with each other and with branches of\r\nthe vagus and recurrent nerves. They are subject to considerable\r\nvariation, but their general arrangement may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\n(_a_) On the right side there are usually two cardiac nerves. Of these\r\none passes back with the vagus in the angle between the right brachial\r\nartery and the common carotid trunk, pierces the pericardium, crosses\r\nthe aortic arch, and divides into branches which are mingled with those\r\nof the left nerves. The second crosses obliquely over the right face of\r\nthe trachea and joins the vagus, where the latter gives off the right\r\nrecurrent nerve; a small plexus is formed here, from which two or three\r\ncardiac branches are detached. These pass back beneath the trachea and\r\nramify on the atria and ventricles.\r\n\r\n(_b_) On the left side there are commonly three cardiac nerves. One of\r\nthese is distributed to the great vessels in the anterior mediastinum.\r\nThe largest passes back at first with the vagus beneath the arch of the\r\nleft brachial artery, inclines downward, perforates the pericardium, and\r\ndivides into two branches. One branch passes beneath the bifurcation of\r\nthe pulmonary artery and is distributed to the left atrium. The larger\r\nbranch dips in between the aorta and the pulmonary artery, gives twigs\r\nto these vessels, and ramifies on the ventricles, especially along the\r\ncourse of the right coronary artery. The third nerve crosses the deep\r\nface of the left brachial artery, passes back below the trachea, and\r\nunites with filaments of a right cardiac nerve. It passes around the\r\naorta and ramifies chiefly along the course of the left coronary artery\r\non the left face of the ventricles.\r\n\r\n3. The =thoracic part= (Pars thoracalis systematis sympathici) extends\r\nbelow the costo-vertebral joints from the inferior cervical ganglion to\r\nthe upper border of the diaphragm, and passes between the latter and the\r\npsoas minor to be continued by the abdominal part.\r\n\r\nThe =trunk= is concealed in the first part of its course by the outer\r\nborder of the longus colli, but further back it is visible under the\r\npleura.\r\n\r\nThe =ganglia= are arranged segmentally at each intercostal space and\r\npartly on the heads of the ribs. They are flattened and are small and\r\nfusiform, with the exception of the first. This (G. thoracale primum) is\r\nextensive, irregularly quadrilateral in outline, and is united with the\r\ninferior cervical ganglion. The ganglia are connected with the thoracic\r\nnerves by white and gray rami communicantes.\r\n\r\nThe =visceral branches= comprise aortic, cardiac, pulmonary, and\r\nœsophageal branches, and the splanchnic nerves. The =aortic branches=\r\nramify on the thoracic artery, forming around that vessel the =thoracic\r\naortic plexus= (P. aorticus thoracalis). The =cardiac branches= concur\r\nwith those of the vagus in forming the =cardiac plexus= (P. cardiacus).\r\nFrom this branches go to form the =coronary plexuses= (P. coronarii)\r\nalong the course of the vessels of like name. The =pulmonary branches=\r\njoin with corresponding branches of the vagus and filaments from the\r\ncardiac plexus in forming the =pulmonary plexus= (P. pulmonalis) at the\r\nroot of the lung. Branches of the plexus, on which are minute ganglia,\r\nramify with the bronchi in the substance of the lung.[211] The\r\n=œsophageal branches= join with those of the vagus in the formation of\r\nthe =œsophageal plexus= (P. œsophageus).\r\n\r\nThe =great splanchnic nerve= (N. splanchnicus major) arises by a series\r\nof roots derived from the sixth or seventh to the fifteenth or sixteenth\r\nthoracic ganglia inclusive. It extends at first along the inner side of\r\nthe thoracic trunk, then crosses the latter ventrally, passes back\r\nbetween the crus of the diaphragm and the outer border of the psoas\r\nminor, and joins the cœliac ganglion. It is small at its origin, but\r\nbecomes considerably larger than the sympathetic trunk. Near its\r\ntermination it bears the small =splanchnic ganglion=, from which and\r\nfrom the nerve, filaments go to the aorta, the œsophagus, and the\r\nvertebræ.\r\n\r\nThe =small splanchnic nerve= (N. splanchnicus minor) is formed by roots\r\nderived from the last two or three thoracic ganglia. It runs back with\r\nthe great splanchnic nerve, but ends in the cœliac or in the renal and\r\nadrenal plexuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n  This nerve is not always present and is variable in arrangement. The\r\n  roots communicate by filaments with the great splanchnic.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The =abdominal part= of the sympathetic trunk (Pars abdominalis\r\nsystematis sympathici) lies along the inner border of the psoas minor,\r\nabove the aorta on the left side and the posterior vena cava on the\r\nright (Fig. 524). The trunk is smaller than the thoracic part, and\r\npresents usually six small fusiform =lumbar ganglia= (G. lumbalia),\r\nwhich are connected by rami communicantes with the ventral divisions of\r\nthe lumbar nerves. Visceral branches go to the aortic and hypogastric\r\nplexuses, and to the cœliac and mesenteric ganglia.\r\n\r\n5. The =pelvic part= of the sympathetic trunk (Pars pelvina systematis\r\nsympathici) begins at the last lumbar ganglion and extends along the\r\npelvic surface of the sacrum internal to the emergence of the ventral\r\nbranches of the sacral nerves (Fig. 451). At the third segment of the\r\nsacrum the trunk divides into internal and external branches. The\r\ninternal branch inclines to the median plane and unites with the\r\nopposite branch. At the junction there is often found the small\r\n=coccygeal ganglion= (G. impar), which lies on the coccygeal artery at\r\nthe joint between the first and second coccygeal vertebræ. A filament\r\nfrom the ganglion accompanies the artery. The external branch\r\ncommunicates with the last two sacral nerves and joins the ventral\r\ncoccygeal nerves. Ganglia occur near each of the first three sacral\r\nforamina, and are connected by gray rami communicantes with the adjacent\r\nspinal nerves. The visceral branches are distributed through the\r\nhypogastric plexus. They supply motor fibers to the longitudinal and\r\ninhibitory fibers to the circular muscular coat of the rectum, motor\r\nfibers to the bladder and uterus, and the vasodilator fibers (Nn.\r\nerigentes) to the penis.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE ABDOMINAL AND PELVIC PLEXUSES\r\n\r\nThe chief plexuses which distribute nerves to the viscera and vessels of\r\nthe abdominal and pelvic cavities are two in number, the solar and the\r\npelvic. From them fibers proceed to form numerous subsidiary plexuses\r\nwhich are named according to the organs which they supply or the vessels\r\nwhich they enlace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE SOLAR PLEXUS\r\n\r\nThe =solar plexus= (Fig. 450) is situated on the dorsal wall of the\r\nabdominal cavity in relation to the aorta and the origin of its chief\r\nvisceral branches. It comprises the cœliaco-mesenteric ganglia and the\r\ncœliac and anterior mesenteric plexuses.\r\n\r\nThe =cœliaco-mesenteric ganglia=[212] are two in number, right and left.\r\nThey are situated on each side of the aorta, in relation to the origin\r\nof the cœliac and anterior mesenteric arteries. The right ganglion is\r\nconcealed by the posterior vena cava; it is irregularly quadrilateral\r\nand is about two inches (4 to 6 cm.) in length. The left ganglion is\r\nlargely covered by the left adrenal; it is narrower than the right one\r\nand is three or four inches (ca. 8 to 10 cm.) long. The two ganglia are\r\nunited by irregular connecting branches in front of and behind the\r\nanterior mesenteric artery.[213] Each receives the splanchnic nerve of\r\nits own side and branches from the dorsal œsophageal continuation of the\r\nvagus nerves. Branches from the ganglia and the cords which connect them\r\npass back to the small stellate =posterior mesenteric ganglia=, which\r\nare situated at the origin of the posterior mesenteric artery.\r\n\r\nThe =cœliac plexus= (P. cœliacus) consists of a feltwork of nerve-fibers\r\nin which are small ganglia. It surrounds the cœliac artery and from it\r\nproceed the following unpaired secondary plexuses which accompany the\r\narterial branches:\r\n\r\n1. The =gastric plexus= (P. gastricus) enlaces the gastric artery and\r\ndivides like the artery into two parts, forming the anterior and\r\nposterior gastric plexuses. These receive branches of the vagus nerves.\r\n\r\n2. The =hepatic plexus= (P. hepaticus) is formed by several nerves of\r\nconsiderable size which accompany the hepatic artery and the portal\r\nvein. It receives fibers from the left vagus, ramifies in the liver, and\r\ngives off branches which accompany the collateral branches of the\r\nhepatic artery and supply the areas in which these vessels are\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\n3. The =splenic plexus= (P. lienalis) resembles the preceding in its\r\narrangement. In addition to its terminal branches to the spleen, it\r\ngives collateral twigs to the pancreas and the left part of the greater\r\ncurvature of the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior mesenteric plexus= (P. mesentericus cranialis) is formed\r\nmainly by branches from the posterior part of the cœliaco-mesenteric\r\nganglia; it is continuous with the cœliac plexus in front and the\r\nposterior mesenteric behind. It surrounds the anterior mesenteric trunk\r\nand its branches, and supplies the viscera to which these vessels are\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior mesenteric plexus= (P. mesentericus caudalis) accompanies\r\nthe artery of like name in its distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The secondary plexuses which accompany the branches of the mesenteric\r\n  arteries give off branches which form two fine peripheral plexuses in\r\n  the wall of the intestine. One of these, the =myenteric plexus= (P.\r\n  myentericus) or plexus of Auerbach, lies between the layers of the\r\n  muscular coat, and is provided with microscopic ganglia. The other is\r\n  in the submucous tissue, and is therefore termed the =submucous\r\n  plexus= (P. submucosus) or plexus of Meissner.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following paired plexuses are derived mainly from branches of the\r\ncœliac and aortic plexuses:\r\n\r\n1. The =renal plexuses= (P. renales) proceed largely from the\r\ncœliaco-mesenteric ganglia, but receive fibers also from the small\r\nsplanchnic nerves. They enlace the renal arteries and supply the\r\nkidneys. Minute renal ganglia occur on the course of the nerves along\r\nthe renal vessels.\r\n\r\n2. The =adrenal plexuses= (P. suprarenales) are formed by a relatively\r\nvery large number of fine fibers derived in great part directly from the\r\ncœliaco-mesenteric ganglia. Numerous minute ganglia occur in their\r\nmeshes.\r\n\r\n3 _a_. The =spermatic plexuses= (P. spermatid) proceed largely from the\r\naortic and renal plexuses. Each accompanies the corresponding (internal)\r\nspermatic artery to the testicle.\r\n\r\n3 _b_. The =utero-ovarian plexuses= (P. ovarici) are the homologues in\r\nthe female of the preceding. They accompany the utero-ovarian arteries\r\nto the ovary and the cornua of the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe =hypogastric= or =pelvic plexus= (P. hypogastricus) is the pelvic\r\ncontinuation of the aortic and posterior mesenteric plexuses. The chief\r\nnerves which form it enter the pelvic cavity ventral to the large\r\nvessels, anastomose with each other and with branches from the third and\r\nfourth sacral nerves, and ramify on the pelvic viscera. The peripheral\r\nplexuses derived therefrom are named according to the organs which they\r\nsupply; the chief of these are the =hæmorrhoidal=, =vesical=,\r\n=uterovaginal=, =prostatic=, =cavernous= (of the penis or clitoris).\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE OX[214]\r\n\r\nThe =spinal cord= resembles that of the horse in conformation and\r\nstructure. In cattle of medium size its length is about 165 to 170 cm.\r\n(ca. 65 to 67 inches) and its weight about 240 to 250 grains (ca. 8\r\nounces).\r\n\r\n\r\n  In a cow 140 cm. in height Dexler found the weight of the cord\r\n  (including the intradural nerve-roots) to be 260 g. and the length 162\r\n  cm. The lengths of the regions were: cervical 41 cm., thoracic 72 cm.,\r\n  lumbar 32 cm., sacral 7 cm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =brain= has an average weight of about 500 grams (ca. 16 to 17\r\nounces). Its differences in general form are correlated with those noted\r\nin the consideration of the cranial cavity.\r\n\r\nThe =medulla= is short, wide, and thick. Its ventral face is strongly\r\nconvex. The pyramids are narrow, short, and close together in front.\r\nNear the decussation there is a well defined oval prominence on either\r\nside which indicates the position of the posterior olive. The corpus\r\ntrapezoideum is large; it has no central part between the pyramids. The\r\nexternal arcuate fibers are distinct. The restiform bodies are short and\r\nthick and diverge more strongly than in the horse. The floor of the\r\nfourth ventricle is only about two-thirds as long as in the horse. The\r\narea acustica is a well-marked oval prominence lateral to the middle\r\npart of the limiting sulcus. The tuberculum acusticum at the origin of\r\nthe auditory nerve is very large. The anterior fovea is distinct. The\r\nposterior recess of the fourth ventricle communicates through the\r\nforamen of Magendie (Apertura mediana) with the subarachnoid space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 528.—BRAIN OF COW, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Sulcus transversus; _2_, longitudinal fissure; _3_,\r\n    antero-internal frontal gyrus; _4_, olfactory bulb; _5_, marginal or\r\n    sagittal pole of hemisphere; _6_, lateral fissure (of Sylvius); _7_,\r\n    hemisphere of cerebellum; _8_, vermis of same; _9_, accessory nerve;\r\n    _10_, dorsal root of first cervical nerve. (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat.\r\n    d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =pons= is smaller, both transversely and longitudinally, than that\r\nof the horse. It is strongly convex and has a distinct central\r\ndepression.\r\n\r\nThe =cerebellum= is smaller and more angular in form than in the horse.\r\nThe vermis is large and has a distinct depression on its anterior face\r\nfor the posterior corpora quadrigemina. The hemispheres are relatively\r\nsmall and are not clearly divided into tabulations. The anterior\r\npeduncles are very short.\r\n\r\nThe =cerebral peduncles= are short. A small eminence in the locus\r\nperforatus posticus is caused by the presence of the interpeduncular\r\nganglion. The =internal geniculate body= is prominent. The =pineal body=\r\nis long and fusiform, and is often pigmented in spots. The third\r\nventricle forms two considerable recesses in relation to the pineal\r\nbody: one (R. pinealis) extends up into the body; the other (R.\r\nsuprapinealis) is a long tubular prolongation in front of it.\r\n\r\nThe =optic tracts= cross the cerebral peduncles almost at a right angle.\r\n\r\nThe =pituitary body= is situated in a deep fossa and is surrounded by a\r\nplexus of vessels.\r\n\r\nThe =cerebral hemispheres= are shorter, higher, and relatively wider\r\nthan in the horse. The frontal poles are small, the occipital large.\r\nViewed from the side, the dorsal surface is strongly convex. The highest\r\npoint of the dorso-medial border is a little in front of its middle and\r\nforms a marked prominence termed the =sagittal= or =marginal pole=\r\n(Polus sagittalis s. prominentia marginalis dorsalis). Anterior to this\r\nthe border drops abruptly, being cut into by the deep transverse\r\nfissure. The arachnoid on the basal and anterior parts of the\r\nhemispheres is usually pigmented. The =corpus callosum= extends through\r\na little more than a third of the length of the hemisphere. The pattern\r\nof the =fissures= and =gyri= of the pallium is somewhat simpler than in\r\nthe horse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 529.—CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES OF OX, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Transverse fissure; _b_, lateral fissure (of Sylvius); _c_,\r\n    coronal fissure; _d_, diagonal fissure; _e_, entomarginal fissure;\r\n    _f_, marginal fissure; _g_, ectomarginal fissure; _h_, suprasylvian\r\n    fissure. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. The =lateral fissure= (of Sylvius) is very deep. Its middle branch\r\n  extends almost vertically upward on the middle of the lateral surface\r\n  of the hemisphere, and is separated by a gyrus of variable width from\r\n  the suprasylvian fissure. The anterior branch runs forward about\r\n  parallel with the sulcus rhinalis anterior, from which it is separated\r\n  by the short gyri of the insula. The latter are covered to a small\r\n  extent only by the overhanging gyri (operculum). The posterior branch\r\n  may run back a distance of only about 1.5 cm. and end in T-shaped\r\n  manner, or it may join the sulcus rhinalis posterior.\r\n\r\n  2. The =suprasylvian fissure= is deep and very distinct. It extends in\r\n  an undulating manner from the lateral surface of the occipital pole to\r\n  the outer side of the sagittal pole. Here it may be interrupted or may\r\n  be continued by the =coronal fissure=, which descends to the frontal\r\n  pole and divides into two short branches.\r\n\r\n  3. The =diagonal fissure= (S. diagonalis) begins in front of the stem\r\n  of the lateral fissure and runs upward and forward. Its form is very\r\n  variable.\r\n\r\n  4. The =transverse fissure= cuts obliquely into the dorsal border in\r\n  front of the sagittal pole. It is short and deep and commonly\r\n  communicates with the suprasylvian and coronal fissures.\r\n\r\n  5. The =marginal fissure= is distinct. It extends from the sagittal\r\n  pole to the occipital pole. It is flexuous and deviates outward\r\n  somewhat in its posterior two-thirds.\r\n\r\n  6. The =entomarginal fissure= lies medial and parallel to the\r\n  posterior part of the preceding.\r\n\r\n  7. The =ectomarginal fissure= is lateral and parallel to the marginal\r\n  fissure. It does not extend so far in either direction as the latter\r\n  and is often more or less broken up by annectent gyri.\r\n\r\n  8. The =sulcus rhinalis= is more open than in the horse, since it is\r\n  not overlapped by the gyri above it.\r\n\r\n  9. The =calloso-marginal= fissure is flexuous and not so regular as in\r\n  the horse. It is often interrupted at or near the level of the genu of\r\n  the corpus callosum, in which case the =genual fissure= continues it\r\n  downward.\r\n\r\n  10. The =crucial fissure= is faint and is confined to the medial\r\n  surface. It lies about one centimeter in front of the transverse\r\n  fissure and commonly joins the calloso-marginal fissure below.\r\n\r\n  11. Short and variable fissures occur in front of and behind the\r\n  middle branch of the lateral fissure (F. ectosylvia anterior,\r\n  posterior).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =olfactory bulb= is much smaller than in the horse. The external\r\nolfactory tract is large, the inner one small and not distinct.\r\n\r\nThe =cranial nerves= have in general the same superficial origin as in\r\nthe horse. The more important differences in other respects are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe =oculomotor nerve= is larger than in the horse. It emerges with the\r\nfourth, sixth, ophthalmic, and maxillary nerves through the large\r\nforamen, which is equivalent to the foramen lacerum orbitale and foramen\r\nrotundum of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe internal branch of the =lacrimal nerve= supplies twigs to the mucous\r\nmembrane of the frontal sinus; the large outer branch runs backward and\r\nsupplies the matrix of the horn. The =frontal nerve= emerges from the\r\norbit below the supraorbital process. The =naso-ciliary nerve= is large\r\nand sends filaments to the ocular muscles. The =ciliary ganglion= is\r\nsomewhat larger than in the horse and is connected with the lower\r\ndivision of the oculomotor nerve by several short filaments. In\r\nconsequence of the absence of the canine and upper incisor teeth the\r\ncorresponding branch of the infraorbital nerve is naturally wanting. The\r\n=mandibular nerve= emerges through the foramen ovale. The =superficial\r\ntemporal nerve= gives off a large branch which joins the superior buccal\r\ndivision of the facial on the masseter, about half-way between the\r\nzygomatic arch and the angle of the jaw. The =otic ganglion= is larger\r\nthan in the horse. According to Moussu the buccinator nerve furnishes\r\nexcito-secretory twigs to the parotid and inferior buccal glands.\r\n\r\nThe =facial nerve= divides into its two terminal branches before\r\nreaching the border of the jaw. The =superior buccal nerve= is the\r\nlarger of the two; it crosses the masseter much lower than in the horse.\r\nThe relatively small =inferior buccal nerve= runs beneath the parotid or\r\nin the gland substance parallel with the border of the lower jaw,\r\ncrosses under the insertion of the sterno-cephalicus, and runs forward\r\nalong the depressor labii inferioris. At the point where it crosses the\r\nfacial vein and parotid duct it gives off an anastomotic branch to the\r\nsuperior nerve. The =auriculo-palpebral nerve= is large.\r\n\r\nThe =vagus= bears—in addition to the relatively large =jugular\r\nganglion=—a =ganglion nodosum= at the point of origin of the superior\r\nlaryngeal nerve. The trunk is large. The =pharyngeal branch= is large\r\nand anastomoses with the superior and external laryngeal nerves. The\r\nlatter commonly arises directly from the trunk. The =superior œsophageal\r\ntrunk= communicates with the splanchnic nerve, contributes twigs to the\r\nhepatic plexus, and ramifies chiefly on the right surface of the rumen\r\nand the adjacent surface of the abomasum. The =inferior œsophageal\r\ntrunk= supplies branches to the hepatic plexus and to all the divisions\r\nof the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe =spinal accessory nerve= presents two special features. The part\r\nwhich joins the jugular ganglion bears a small ganglion. The ventral\r\nbranch supplies both parts of the sterno-cephalicus.\r\n\r\nThe =hypoglossal nerve= is large. It is connected with the ventral\r\ndivision of the first cervical nerve by a branch of considerable size,\r\nand detaches a long branch which runs backward along the carotid artery.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =spinal nerves= resemble those of the horse in origin and general\r\narrangement. The thoracic nerves number thirteen pairs. The more\r\nimportant differences in the limb-plexuses and their branches are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe =brachial plexus= is formed by the ventral branches of the last\r\nthree cervical and first thoracic nerves; the second thoracic nerve\r\nfurnishes no root, but the ventral branch of the sixth cervical goes\r\nalmost entirely to the plexus after giving off the nerve to the\r\nrhomboideus and the cervical part of the serratus magnus.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the nerves above the elbow are not of sufficient\r\nmoment to receive notice in this brief account, but below this point\r\nthere are naturally important special features correlated chiefly with\r\nthe arrangement of the digits.\r\n\r\nThe =radial nerve= is continued below the elbow by a large =cutaneous\r\nbranch= (N. cutaneus antibrachii dorsalis) which emerges at the lower\r\nborder of the external head of the triceps and descends on the dorsal\r\naspect of the limb. It communicates above the carpus with the cutaneous\r\nbranch of the median nerve and terminates in three =dorsal digital\r\nnerves=; two of these descend along the axial or interdigital side of\r\nthe dorsal surface of the chief digits, and the third along the inner\r\n(abaxial) side of the inner chief digit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 530.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF OX, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Dorsal digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 531.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF OX, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Volar digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =ulnar nerve= divides at a variable distance down the forearm into\r\ntwo branches. The =dorsal= or =superficial branch= emerges between the\r\ntendons of the external and middle flexors of the carpus, and is\r\ncontinued as the =external dorsal digital nerve= on the outer chief\r\ndigit. The =volar= or =deep branch= descends along the superficial\r\ndigital flexor, gives a branch to the suspensory ligament below the\r\ncarpus, and unites with the external branch of the median nerve to form\r\nthe =external volar digital nerve=.\r\n\r\nThe =median nerve= is much larger than the ulnar. It passes beneath the\r\npronator teres, descends the forearm as in the horse, and divides in the\r\ndistal part of the metacarpus into two branches. The =internal branch=\r\ngives twigs to the inner small digit and is continued on the inner side\r\nof the volar surface of the inner chief digit as the =internal volar\r\ndigital nerve= (N. digitalis medialis digiti III); it also concurs with\r\nthe outer branch in forming the two digital nerves which descend along\r\nthe interdigital aspect of the chief digits. The =external branch= is\r\nlarger. It bifurcates, and one division unites with the twig from the\r\ninternal branch to form a common digital trunk. From the latter two\r\ndigital nerves proceed as mentioned above; these are the =external= and\r\n=internal volar digital nerves= of the internal and external chief\r\ndigits respectively (N. digitalis volaris lateralis digiti III, medialis\r\ndigiti IV). The other division unites with the volar branch of the ulnar\r\nnerve to form the =external volar digital nerve= of the external chief\r\ndigit (N. digitalis lateralis digiti IV).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 532.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF OX, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Dorsal digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 533.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF OX, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Plantar digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lumbo-sacral plexus= and its branches to the pelvis and thigh\r\npresent no very striking special features.\r\n\r\nThe =superficial peroneal nerve= is much larger than in the horse. After\r\ncrossing beneath the peroneus longus it passes down on the front of the\r\ntarsus and metatarsus and divides into three branches. The internal and\r\nexternal branches descend as the =internal= and =external dorsal digital\r\nnerves= on the chief digits. The larger middle branch joins a branch of\r\nthe deep peroneal nerve in the interdigital space, and from this union\r\nproceed the =dorsal digital nerves= which descend on the opposed\r\nsurfaces of the chief digits.\r\n\r\nThe =deep peroneal nerve= descends in the leg as in the horse and\r\ncontinues down the anterior groove of the metatarsus with the dorsal\r\nmetatarsal artery. Its terminal branches concur with branches from the\r\nsuperficial peroneal nerve in the formation of the two axial =dorsal\r\ndigital nerves= (N. dig. dors. lat. dig. III et dig. dors. med. dig. IV\r\npedis), and with a branch of the internal plantar nerve in the formation\r\nof corresponding plantar digital nerves.\r\n\r\nThe =tibial nerve= divides at the back of the hock into internal and\r\nexternal plantar nerves. The =internal plantar nerve= descends between\r\nthe superficial flexor tendon and the suspensory ligament and divides\r\ninto two branches; the inner branch descends as the =internal plantar\r\ndigital nerve= (N. dig. plant. med. dig. III) along the inner side of\r\nthe flexor tendons of the inner chief digit; the outer branch turns\r\naround the flexor tendons to reach the interdigital space, where it\r\nconcurs with a branch of the deep peroneal nerve in the formation of two\r\n=axial plantar digital nerves= (N. dig. plant. lat. dig. III et dig.\r\nplant. med. dig. IV) which descend on the opposed surfaces of the chief\r\ndigits. The =external plantar nerve= descends along the outer border of\r\nthe flexor tendons, gives a branch to the suspensory ligament and to the\r\nexternal small digit, and continues along the outer face of the external\r\ndigit as the =external plantar digital nerve= (N. dig. plant. lat. dig.\r\nIV).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =sympathetic system= closely resembles that of the horse in its\r\ngeneral arrangement, and only a few differential features will receive\r\nattention. The =superior cervical ganglion= is closer to the cranial\r\nbase and is thicker than in the horse; its branches to the carotid and\r\ncavernous plexuses are large, and no connection is formed with the\r\nspinal accessory nerve. The =cervical trunk= is smaller than in the\r\nhorse, and arises by two or three bundles from the superior cervical\r\nganglion behind its middle. The =inferior cervical ganglion= is\r\ndistinctly separable from the first thoracic; the latter is large. There\r\nare thirteen pairs of =thoracic ganglia=. The =cœliaco-mesenteric\r\nganglia= are plexiform, not compact. There are five pairs of =sacral\r\nganglia=, and the right and left trunks are connected here by transverse\r\nanastomoses.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE PIG\r\n\r\nThe =spinal cord= weighs about 42 grams (Ellenberger-Baum). It is almost\r\ncircular in cross-section, except at the enlargements, where it is\r\nsomewhat flattened dorso-ventrally. The conus medullaris extends to the\r\nanterior part of the third sacral segment. The epidural space is\r\noccupied by a large quantity of fat.\r\n\r\nThe =brain= in adults of medium size weighs about 125 grams (ca. 4 to 4½\r\nounces). When viewed from above, it is seen to have an elongated oval\r\nform. The occipital poles overlie the cerebellum to a small extent only;\r\nthe frontal poles are rounded and relatively large, but do not conceal\r\nthe ends of the olfactory bulbs. The =medulla= is relatively broad. The\r\ncuneate tubercle is very large and is limited externally by a groove.\r\nThe corpus trapezoideum is very wide laterally. The =pons= is less\r\nprominent than in the ox. The =cerebellum= is very wide and short. Its\r\nanterior face is flattened and presents a depression for the corpora\r\nquadrigemina. The vermis is large. The hemispheres consist of an inner\r\nlarge and an outer small part. The =cerebral peduncles= are very short.\r\nThe posterior corpora quadrigemina are wide apart, rounded, and\r\nrelatively large. The internal geniculate body is prominent. The\r\n=cerebral hemispheres= are somewhat bean-shaped in lateral profile, the\r\nconvex border being dorsal. The arrangement of the gyri and sulci is\r\nsimpler than in the horse or ox. The principal fissures are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =lateral fissure= (of Sylvius) begins at the sulcus rhinalis and\r\nruns upward and somewhat backward on the depressed part of the lateral\r\nsurface of the hemisphere; it appears unbranched on superficial\r\nexamination, but when the gyrus which almost completely conceals the\r\ninsula is raised, an anterior branch is exposed which forms the dorsal\r\nboundary of the insula.\r\n\r\n2. The =suprasylvian fissure= pursues a curved course approximately\r\nparallel with the dorso-medial border of the hemisphere. Its posterior\r\nend is separated by a short interval from the sulcus rhinalis posterior.\r\nFrom its highest point a branch proceeds obliquely upward and forward,\r\ncrosses the dorso-medial border, and joins the splenial fissure.\r\n\r\n3. The =diagonal fissure= crosses the anterior part of the lateral\r\nsurface. It is directed obliquely downward and backward.\r\n\r\n4. The =coronal fissure= is constant and deep. It is directed upward and\r\ninward over the frontal pole, continues backward near the dorso-medial\r\nborder, and usually ends by passing obliquely over the border to the\r\ninner surface of the hemisphere.\r\n\r\n5. The =presylvian fissure= begins—apparently as a branch of the sulcus\r\nrhinalis anterior—about 2 cm. in front of the lateral fissure, and\r\ncurves over the lateral aspect of the frontal pole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 534.—CEREBRAL HEMISPHERES OF PIG, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Upper part of lateral fissure (of Sylvius); _b_, cruciate\r\n    fissure; _c_, suprasylvian fissure, with its anterior branch (_c′_)\r\n    and upper branch (_c″_); _d_, diagonal fissure; _e_, coronal\r\n    fissure; _f_, presylvian fissure; _g_, marginal fissure; _h_,\r\n    ectomarginal fissure; _i_, entomarginal fissure. (After Ellenberger,\r\n    in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n6. The =marginal fissure= begins behind the cruciate fissure close to\r\nthe dorso-medial border and extends in a gentle curve backward almost to\r\nthe occipital pole.\r\n\r\n7. The =ectomarginal fissure= lies above and nearly parallel to the\r\nposterior part of the suprasylvian fissure.\r\n\r\n8. The =entomarginal fissure= lies along the posterior part of the\r\ndorso-medial border.\r\n\r\n9. The =calloso-marginal fissure= consists of two separate parts. The\r\nmore extensive posterior part is termed the =splenial fissure=. It\r\nextends from the tentorial aspect of the hemisphere in a direction\r\nparallel with the corpus callosum nearly to the middle of the medial\r\nsurface; it is continued by the cruciate fissure and is also connected\r\nwith the suprasylvian and coronal fissures by branches which pass\r\nobliquely upward and forward. The anterior part, the =genual fissure=,\r\nlies about midway between the anterior part of the corpus callosum and\r\nthe dorso-medial border.\r\n\r\n10. The =cruciate fissure= is short and shallow. It runs obliquely\r\nupward and forward from the anterior end of the splenial fissure on the\r\ninner surface of the hemisphere.\r\n\r\n11. The =sulcus rhinalis= extends in an undulating manner along the\r\nentire lower part of the lateral surface of the hemisphere and forms the\r\nupper limit of the rhinencephalon.\r\n\r\nThe =olfactory bulbs= are very large and the =tracts= extremely broad\r\nand short. The trigonum olfactorium is so prominent as to be termed the\r\n=tuberculum olfactorium=.\r\n\r\nThe =cranial nerves= present the following special features:\r\n\r\nThe =third=, =fourth=, =sixth=, and the =ophthalmic= and =maxillary\r\ndivisions= of the fifth nerve, emerge together as in the ox.\r\n\r\nThe =lacrimal nerve= resembles that of the horse, the =frontal= that of\r\nthe ox. The =naso-ciliary nerve= is relatively large and sends numerous\r\nfilaments to the ocular muscles. The =maxillary nerve= has a very short\r\ncourse in the pterygo-palatine fossa. The =infraorbital nerve= is large\r\nin correlation with the development of the snout which receives numerous\r\nbranches. The =mandibular nerve= emerges through the foramen lacerum\r\nanterius. The =superficial temporal nerve= is small; according to Moussu\r\nit furnishes the excito-secretory fibers to the upper part of the\r\nparotid gland, while those going to the lower part are derived from the\r\nmylo-hyoid nerve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 535.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF PIG, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _c_, Dorsal common digital nerves; _p_, dorsal proper digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 536.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF PIG, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Volar proper digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =inferior buccal nerve= passes downward and forward under cover of\r\nthe parotid gland and accompanies the parotid duct, with which it turns\r\naround the lower border of the jaw in front of the masseter.\r\n\r\nThe =vagus= bears a =jugular ganglion= and a =ganglion nodosum=; the\r\nlatter occurs at the point of origin of the superior laryngeal nerve,\r\nand may be as large as a small pea. Proximal to this the vagus is easily\r\ndivided into two strands, one of which is the accessory component. The\r\nœsophageal trunks form a posterior œsophageal plexus, as in man, from\r\nwhich two nerves issue. The inferior nerve is small and ramifies on the\r\nparietal surface of the stomach. The superior trunk is much larger; it\r\ngives branches to the stomach, crosses the lesser curvature of that\r\norgan, and joins the solar plexus.\r\n\r\nThe =hypoglossal nerve= may present a small dorsal root, on which there\r\nis a minute hypoglossal ganglion (of Froriep).\r\n\r\nThe =spinal nerves= number on each side eight in the cervical region,\r\nfourteen (commonly) in the thoracic, seven in the lumbar, and four in\r\nthe sacral. Some of the special features of the nerves of the limbs are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nThe =brachial plexus= is derived from the same nerves as in the ox, but\r\nthe root furnished by the sixth cervical is relatively smaller. The\r\nplexus consists of two parts, the upper of which emerges above the\r\nscalenus, the lower between the two parts of that muscle. The more\r\nimportant differences in the nerves emanating from the plexus from the\r\narrangement in the ox occur in the lower part of the limb. The cutaneous\r\nbranch of the =radial nerve= divides at the carpus into branches which\r\nconcur with the dorsal branch of the ulnar nerve in supplying the\r\n=dorsal digital nerves=, two for each digit. The =volar digital nerves=,\r\nalso two for each digit, are formed by the terminal branches of the\r\n=median nerve= and the volar or deep branch of the =ulnar nerve=. The\r\nformation and arrangement of the digital nerves are indicated in the\r\nannexed schematic figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 537.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF PIG, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Dorsal proper digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 538.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF PIG, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Plantar proper digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lumbo-sacral plexus= is derived from the ventral branches of the\r\nlast three lumbar and first sacral nerves. The distribution of the\r\nbranches of the plexus differs chiefly in the distal part of the limb.\r\nThe =superficial peroneal nerve= is large and terminates by forming the\r\ngreater part of the =dorsal digital nerves=. The latter, two for each\r\ndigit, are also in part formed by the terminal branches of the =deep\r\nperoneal nerve=.\r\n\r\nThe =tibial nerve= divides at the tarsus into =internal= and =external\r\nplantar nerves=. The latter divide to form the =plantar digital nerves=,\r\ntwo for each digit. In addition, the external plantar nerve supplies a\r\nbranch to the dorsal aspect of the outer (fifth) digit. The arrangement\r\nof the digital nerves is indicated by the annexed schematic figures.\r\n\r\nThe =sympathetic system= of the pig has received very little attention\r\nfrom anatomists. The =superior cervical ganglion= is long and fusiform.\r\nIt gives off filaments which join the vagus near the ganglion nodosum.\r\nThe =cervical trunk= is short and relatively larger than in the ox; it\r\nis inclosed in a common sheath with the vagus in the neck and separates\r\nfrom that nerve to join the =middle cervical ganglion= at the thoracic\r\ninlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE DOG\r\n\r\nThe =spinal cord= is almost circular in cross-section except at the\r\nwell-marked cervical and lumbar enlargements, where it is compressed\r\ndorso-ventrally. The conus medullaris lies over the junction of the\r\nsixth and seventh lumbar vertebræ. The length of the cord of a rather\r\nlarge dog was found to be about 38 cm.; of this, the cervical part was\r\n11 cm., the thoracic 17.4 cm., the lumbar about 7 cm., and the\r\nsacro-coccygeal about 2.6 cm.

Thus in\r\nsmall terriers the weight is 30 g. or even less, while in very large\r\ndogs it may exceed 150 g. It corresponds much more closely with the\r\ncranium in size and general form than in the animals previously\r\ndescribed; this is specially true of the small breeds, in which the bony\r\ncrests and frontal sinuses are little developed.\r\n\r\nThe =medulla= is broad and thick. Its ventral surface is strongly convex\r\nfrom side to side. The pyramids are large and prominent and are limited\r\nby distinct median and lateral grooves. The olivary eminence is a well\r\ndefined oval elevation situated between the pyramid and the superficial\r\norigin of the hypoglossal nerve. The external arcuate fibers form a wide\r\nband which crosses the lateral surface obliquely upward and forward, and\r\nobscures the groove which limits the restiform body externally. The\r\ncuneate tubercle is distinct. The rhomboid fossa is deep and narrow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 541.—PART OF CROSS-SECTION OF BRAIN OF DOG, PASSING THROUGH\r\n    GANGLION HABENULÆ.\r\n\r\n  _Al_, Ansa lenticularis of thalamic radiation; _C a d_, dorsal end of\r\n    hippocampus; _C a v_, ventral end of same; _C c_, corpus callosum;\r\n    _C g m_, corpus geniculatum mediale; _C m_, corpus mammillare; _F i\r\n    d_, fimbria; _F i v_, ventral part of fimbria; _G h_, ganglion\r\n    habenulæ; _M B_, fasciculus retroflexus; _P p_, pes pedunculi; _T\r\n    h_, thalamus; _T o_, tractus opticus; _T t_, habenula; _V A_,\r\n    fasciculus thalamo-mammillaris; _V F_, fornix ventralis; _II_,\r\n    lateral ventricle; _III_, third ventricle. (After Probst.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =pons= is relatively small. The =corpus trapezoideum= is very wide\r\nand is divided by the pyramids into two lateral parts. The =cerebellum=\r\nis very broad, but is low and also compressed from before backward.\r\nRather more than half of it is overlapped by the cerebral hemispheres.\r\nThe anterior surface is accurately adapted to the concave tentorial\r\nsurfaces of the hemispheres and to the posterior corpora quadrigemina\r\nand their commissure. The posterior surface is almost vertical and is\r\nconvex centrally and flattened laterally. The vermis is prominent and in\r\ngeneral well defined, although it is connected in its middle part with\r\nthe hemispheres. The latter are three-sided and consist of four lobules.\r\nThe anterior peduncles are very short.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior corpora quadrigemina= are large, very wide apart, and\r\nprominent, and are connected by a curved commissure. The =internal\r\ngeniculate body= is large. In the deep interpeduncular fossa are two\r\nsmall bands which indicate the course of the fasciculi retroflexi,\r\ntracts which connect the habenular and interpeduncular ganglia. The\r\n=mammillary body= is double. The =tuber cinereum= is relatively large.\r\nThe =pituitary body= is circular and rather small.\r\n\r\nThe =cerebral hemispheres= are very broad behind and diminish in width\r\nanteriorly; there is a sudden narrowing at the frontal poles, which are\r\nflattened laterally. The tentorial surfaces are concave and form a deep\r\ncavity which receives the anterior part of the cerebellum. The\r\narrangement of the fissures and gyri is simpler than in the animals\r\npreviously examined. The chief fissures are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =lateral fissure= (of Sylvius) extends upward and backward from\r\nthe sulcus rhinalis a little behind the middle of the lateral surface of\r\nthe hemisphere.\r\n\r\n2. The =ectosylvian fissure= has approximately the shape of an inverted\r\nu, and curves over the lateral fissure. It is regarded as consisting of\r\nthree parts—anterior, middle, and posterior (F. ectosylvia anterior,\r\nmedia, posterior).\r\n\r\n3. The =suprasylvian fissure= lies above and approximately concentric\r\nwith the preceding. It also consists of three parts—anterior, middle,\r\nand posterior.\r\n\r\n4. The =ectomarginal= or =collateral fissure= runs forward on the dorsal\r\naspect of the hemisphere almost parallel with the dorso-medial border. A\r\nlittle in front of the middle of the surface it gives off a short\r\n=ansate fissure= (F. ansata) which runs obliquely inward and forward,\r\nand is continued by the coronal fissure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 542.—CEREBRUM OF DOG, DORSAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _a_, End of lateral fissure (of Sylvius); _b_, ectosylvian fissure;\r\n    _c_, _c′_, _c″_, suprasylvian fissure; _d_, fissura ansata minor;\r\n    _e_, ectolateral fissure; _f_, ectomarginal or collateral fissure;\r\n    _g_, fissura ansata; _h_, coronal fissure; _i_, medilateral fissure;\r\n    _k_, entomarginal fissure; _l_, postcruciate fissure; _m_, cruciate\r\n    fissure; _o_, presylvian fissure; _p_, fissura prorea.

The =ectolateral fissure= lies between the posterior part of the\r\nectomarginal fissure and the suprasylvian fissure.\r\n\r\n7. The =entomarginal fissure= lies between the anterior part of the\r\nectomarginal fissure and the dorso-medial border. It is often indistinct\r\nand not rarely absent.\r\n\r\n8. The =presylvian fissure= begins at the sulcus rhinalis, a little in\r\nfront of its middle, and curves over the anterior third of the lateral\r\nsurface of the hemisphere in front of the coronal fissure.\r\n\r\n9. The =cruciate fissure= is the deepest and most characteristic. It\r\ncuts deeply into the anterior third of the dorso-medial border and runs\r\nalmost straight outward. It is continuous on the inner surface of the\r\nhemisphere with the calloso-marginal or splenial fissure.\r\n\r\n10. The =sulcus rhinalis= is continued on the tentorial surface of the\r\nhemisphere by the occipito-temporal fissure.

The =calloso-marginal= or =splenial fissure= is parallel with the\r\nsplenium and middle part of the corpus callosum on the inner surface of\r\nthe hemisphere. It is continuous in front with the cruciate fissure and\r\nruns downward and outward across the tentorial surface to join the\r\noccipito-temporal fissure and sulcus rhinalis. It gives off from its\r\nhighest part the short lesser or accessory cruciate fissure.\r\n\r\n12. The =suprasplenial fissure= runs almost parallel with the posterior\r\npart of the calloso-marginal fissure on the inner and tentorial surfaces\r\nof the hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe =olfactory bulb= is large and is strongly compressed laterally; its\r\nanterior end projects beyond the frontal pole of the hemisphere. The\r\ntract is short and is also flattened laterally. Both contain a narrow\r\ncavity which communicates with the lateral ventricle. The =pyriform\r\nlobe= is large and rounded.\r\n\r\nThe =cranial nerves= present the following special features which are\r\nworthy of notice:\r\n\r\nThe =ophthalmic nerve= gives off lacrimal, frontal, long ciliary,\r\nethmoidal, and infratrochlear branches. The =lacrimal nerve= arises from\r\nthe ophthalmic at its origin;[215] its recurrent branch emerges at the\r\norbital ligament and concurs with the zygomatic and frontal nerves in\r\nthe formation of the anterior auricular plexus. The =frontal nerve=\r\nemerges from the orbit in front of the upper end of the orbital\r\nligament, ramifies in the upper lid and the adjacent skin of the\r\nforehead, and sends branches backward to the anterior auricular plexus.\r\nThe =long ciliary nerve= accompanies the optic nerve and divides into\r\nseveral branches which pierce the posterior part of the sclera. The\r\n=ethmoidal nerve= gives off internal nasal branches and ends in the\r\nmuzzle. The =infratrochlear nerve= runs forward between the internal\r\nstraight and the superior oblique muscles of the eye and ramifies on the\r\nface in the vicinity of the inner canthus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 546.—NERVES OF FACE OF DOG.

Hundes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =maxillary nerve=, after giving off the zygomatic, divides into\r\ninfraorbital and sphenopalatine branches. The =zygomatic nerve= emerges\r\nthrough an opening in the upper part of the orbital ligament and\r\nramifies in the lower lid and on the adjacent surface of the face. The\r\n=infraorbital nerves=, two in number, divide within the infraorbital\r\ncanal and after their emergence upon the face, thus forming seven or\r\neight =external nasal= and =superior labial branches=. The\r\n=sphenopalatine nerve= gives off =lesser= and =greater palatine= and\r\n=posterior nasal nerves=.\r\n\r\nThe =mandibular nerve= passes out through the foramen ovale. The\r\n=superficial temporal nerve= divides into auricular, temporal, and malar\r\nbranches; the last-named crosses the masseter and ramifies with the\r\nbuccal nerves. The =mylo-hyoid nerve= is given off from the mandibular\r\nnerve almost immediately after the latter emerges from the cranium; it\r\ninnervates the mylo-hyoideus and digastricus and gives off a branch\r\nwhich turns around the lower jaw, joins the inferior buccal nerve, and\r\nramifies on the lateral surface of the face. The =inferior alveolar\r\nnerve= arises by a common trunk with the mylo-hyoid; it gives off dental\r\nbranches and terminates in mental and inferior labial branches. The\r\n=lingual nerve= supplies vasodilator and excito-secretory filaments to\r\nthe submaxillary and sublingual salivary glands; these fibers are\r\nderived from the chorda tympani.\r\n\r\nThe =facial nerve= divides near the posterior border of the jaw into\r\nfour branches. The upper branch is the =auriculo-palpebral nerve=, which\r\ndivides after a very short course into anterior auricular and zygomatic\r\nbranches. The latter curves upward and forward across the zygomatic arch\r\ntoward the eye, and divides into branches which supply the eyelids and\r\nnasal region and concur with the frontal and lacrimal nerves in forming\r\nthe anterior auricular plexus. The =superior buccal nerve= accompanies\r\nthe parotid duct across the masseter. The =inferior buccal nerve= runs\r\nforward along the lower border of the masseter and the mandible. The two\r\nnerves ramify on the cheek and anastomose with each other and the\r\ninfraorbital nerves to form a plexus from which branches go to the\r\nmuscles of the lips and nostrils. The =cervical branch= runs downward\r\nand backward over the submaxillary gland and ramifies in the cervical\r\npanniculus; it communicates with the inferior buccal nerve and sends\r\ntwigs to the parotido-auricularis muscle and the submaxillary space.\r\n\r\nThe =vagus= bears a =jugular ganglion= and a =ganglion nodosum=. The\r\nlatter is situated near the superior cervical ganglion on the rectus\r\ncapitis anterior major and dorsal to the carotid artery; it is\r\nfusiform and may be about half an inch (ca. 1 to 1.5 cm.) long in a\r\nlarge dog. In its course in the neck the nerve is inclosed with the\r\nsympathetic trunk in a common sheath and is related ventrally to the\r\ncommon carotid artery. The formation of dorsal and ventral =œsophageal\r\ntrunks= by the union of the dorsal and ventral divisions of the two\r\nnerves takes place at the hiatus œsophageus. The =dorsal trunk=\r\nconcurs with branches of the solar plexus in forming the =posterior\r\ngastric plexus= on the visceral surface of the stomach. The =ventral\r\ntrunk= ramifies on the parietal surface of the stomach, forming the\r\n=anterior gastric plexus=, from which a considerable branch passes\r\nalong the lesser curvature to the pylorus. Some special features of\r\nthe collateral branches are: Two pharyngeal branches are present. The\r\n=superior pharyngeal branch= arises from the vagus above the ganglion\r\nnodosum. It passes under the deep face of the carotid artery and\r\ndescends on the lateral surface of the pharynx to end in the\r\ncrico-thyroid muscle. It furnishes a root of the inferior pharyngeal\r\nbranch, and communicates with the pharyngeal branch of the ninth and\r\nwith the superior laryngeal and hypoglossal nerves. The =inferior\r\npharyngeal branch= is formed by the union of roots derived from the\r\nsuperior pharyngeal nerve and the ganglion nodosum, together with\r\nfilaments from the superior cervical ganglion. It crosses the side of\r\nthe pharynx behind the superior pharyngeal and ramifies on the\r\nposterior constrictor of the pharynx and the origin of the œsophagus.\r\nIt contributes filaments to the pharyngeal plexus, communicates with\r\nthe recurrent nerve, and supplies twigs to the thyroid gland. The\r\n=pharyngeal plexus= is formed on the lateral surface of the pharynx by\r\nbranches of the pharyngeal nerves and the communications above\r\ndescribed; branches from it innervate the muscles and mucous membrane\r\nof the pharynx. The =superior laryngeal nerve= arises from the\r\nganglion nodosum and descends over the side of the pharynx, crossing\r\nbeneath the carotid artery and the superior laryngeal nerve. It passes\r\nthrough the thyroid notch and ramifies in the mucous membrane of the\r\nlarynx. It communicates with the superior cervical ganglion and the\r\nsuperior pharyngeal branch of the vagus, and gives twigs to the\r\nhyo-pharyngeus muscle. Immediately after its entrance into the larynx\r\nit gives off a large branch which, instead of uniting with the\r\nrecurrent as in the other animals, has a peculiar arrangement. It runs\r\nback near the dorsal border of the thyroid cartilage, gives a branch\r\nto the crico-arytenoideus posterior as it passes over that muscle, and\r\ncontinues along the trachea internal to the recurrent nerve. At the\r\nthoracic inlet it communicates with the inferior cervical ganglion and\r\ncontinues backward to unite with the vagus at or near the point of\r\norigin of the recurrent nerve. Its collateral filaments supply the\r\ntrachea and concur with the inferior pharyngeal branch in forming a\r\nplexus on the cervical part of the œsophagus which innervates that\r\ntube.[216] The =depressor nerve= is a very delicate filament which\r\narises usually from the superior laryngeal nerve and accompanies the\r\nvago-sympathetic trunk to the thorax; its fibers reach the heart\r\nthrough the cardiac nerves. The =pulmonary= and =posterior œsophageal\r\nplexuses= are highly developed.\r\n\r\nThe =hypoglossal nerve= gives off a long branch (R. descendens) which\r\nruns downward and backward across the pharynx and larynx, communicates\r\nwith the ventral branch of the first cervical nerve, and supplies the\r\nthyro-hyoid, sterno-hyoid, and sterno-thyroid muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =spinal nerves= number thirty-six or thirty-seven on either side,\r\nand comprise eight cervical, thirteen thoracic, seven lumbar, and five\r\nor six coccygeal.\r\n\r\nThe =brachial plexus= (Fig. 487) is derived from the ventral branches of\r\nthe last four cervical and first thoracic nerves; the root supplied by\r\nthe fifth cervical nerve is very small. The roots unite at the lower\r\nborder of the scalenus. The more important special features in the\r\narrangement of the nerves which emanate from the plexus are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe =musculo-cutaneous nerve= passes between the coraco-brachialis and\r\nthe brachial artery and descends in the arm in front of the artery. At\r\nthe shoulder joint it gives off branches to the biceps and\r\ncoraco-brachialis, and in the lower third of the arm is connected with\r\nthe median nerve by an oblique branch. It terminates near the elbow by\r\ndividing into a branch for the brachialis and a small cutaneous nerve\r\nwhich passes down over the inner face of the elbow and, inclining a\r\nlittle forward, descends over the deep fascia of the forearm to the\r\ncarpus.\r\n\r\nThe =radial nerve= descends behind the ulnar nerve, gives branches to\r\nthe extensors of the elbow, dips in between the internal head of the\r\ntriceps and the accessory head of the anconeus, winds around the arm,\r\nand divides between the brachialis and the external head of the triceps\r\ninto two branches. The =deep branch= (R. profundus) supplies the\r\nextensor and supinator muscles on the forearm. The =superficial branch=\r\n(R. superficialis) emerges upon the flexor surface of the elbow and\r\ndivides into two branches which terminate by supplying two =dorsal\r\ndigital nerves= to each digit, except the fifth, which receives its\r\nouter dorsal nerve from the ulnar. The inner branch descends along the\r\ninner side of the cephalic vein to the carpus, where it divides into\r\ndorsal digital nerves for the first digit and the inner side of the\r\nsecond. The outer branch is much larger. It runs downward on the middle\r\nof the front of the forearm and supplies the remaining dorsal digital\r\nnerves except that to the outer side of the fifth digit.\r\n\r\nThe =ulnar nerve= is as large as or larger than the median, with which\r\nit is united for some distance. At the distal third of the arm it\r\nseparates from the median and passes over the internal epicondyle of the\r\nhumerus. At the proximal part of the forearm it gives off the =dorsal\r\nbranch= (R. dorsalis), which supplies cutaneous twigs to the\r\ndorso-lateral surface of the lower part of the forearm and carpus and\r\nterminates as the =external dorsal digital nerve= of the fifth digit.\r\nDescending under cover of the flexor carpi ulnaris, the ulnar nerve\r\ninclines inward under the tendon of insertion of that muscle and divides\r\ninto superficial and deep branches. The =superficial branch= (R.\r\nsuperficialis) runs downward along the outer border of the flexor\r\ntendons, gives off the =external volar digital nerve of the fifth digit=\r\n(N. dig. vol. lat. dig. V), and a branch (N. met. vol. IV) which\r\ndescends in the space between the fourth and fifth metacarpal bones and\r\nunites with the deep branch. The =deep branch= (R. profundus) descends\r\nin the carpal canal and divides under the deep flexor tendon into its\r\nterminal branches. The smaller of these supply the volar metacarpal\r\nmuscles. The larger terminals are the three =volar common digital\r\nnerves= (Nn. dig. vol. comm. II, III, IV), which descend along the\r\nsecond, third, and fourth intermetacarpal spaces, subdivide, and concur\r\nwith the volar metacarpal branches of the median nerve in forming the\r\n=volar proper digital nerves= (Nn. dig. vol. proprii).\r\n\r\nThe =median nerve= descends behind the brachial artery, passes over the\r\ninternal epicondyle of the humerus, then under the pronator teres, and\r\ncontinues in the forearm under cover of the flexor carpi radialis. It\r\ngives branches below the elbow to the flexor and pronator muscles, and\r\nlower down a palmar branch to the skin on the inner and posterior aspect\r\nof the carpus, and terminates between the superficial and deep flexor\r\ntendons by dividing into three =volar metacarpal nerves= (N. met. vol.\r\nI, II, III). These descend in the first, second, and third\r\nintermetacarpal spaces and unite with the volar common digital nerves in\r\nforming volar proper digital nerves. The arrangement of the digital\r\nnerves is indicated in the annexed schematic figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 547.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF DOG, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Dorsal proper digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 548.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT FORE LIMB OF DOG, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Volar proper digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lumbo-sacral plexus= is formed from the ventral branches of the\r\nlast five lumbar and first sacral nerves. The more important special\r\nfacts in regard to the nerves of the pelvic limb are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe =saphenous nerve= (Fig. 492) is relatively large, and, in fact,\r\nmight be considered as the continuation of the femoral nerve. It\r\ndescends at first in front of the femoral artery, then passes over the\r\nlower part of the inner surface of the thigh with the saphenous artery,\r\ncontinues down the leg with the dorsal branch of that vessel, and\r\nanastomoses with branches of the superficial peroneal nerve. It supplies\r\ncutaneous twigs from the stifle to the metatarsus.\r\n\r\nThe =peroneal nerve= separates from the tibial above the origin of the\r\ngastrocnemius, runs downward and forward across the outer head of that\r\nmuscle, passes between the deep flexor of the digit and the peroneus\r\nlongus, and divides into superficial and deep branches. The =superficial\r\nperoneal nerve= descends the leg along the peroneus tertius and longus,\r\ngives off a =dorsal branch= to the first digit (N. cutaneus dorsalis\r\nmedialis), and divides at the proximal part of the metatarsus into three\r\n=dorsal common digital nerves= (Nn. dig. pedis dors. comm. II, III, IV).\r\nThese descend with the superficial dorsal metatarsal arteries and concur\r\nwith branches of the deep peroneal nerve in forming =dorsal proper\r\ndigital nerves= (Nn. dig. ped. prop. dorsales). The =deep peroneal\r\nnerve= passes down the leg with the anterior tibial vessels. It gives\r\ntwigs to the hock joint and the extensor brevis muscle, and divides into\r\nthree =dorsal metatarsal nerves= (Nn. met. dors. II, III, IV); these\r\ndescend with the corresponding arteries along the intermetatarsal spaces\r\nand unite with the dorsal common digital nerves in supplying the dorsal\r\nproper digital nerves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 549.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF DOG, ANTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Dorsal proper digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 550.—NERVES OF DISTAL PART OF RIGHT HIND LIMB OF DOG, POSTERIOR\r\n    VIEW (SCHEMATIC).\r\n\r\n  _p_, Plantar proper digital nerves.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =tibial nerve= divides at the tarsus into two plantar branches. The\r\n=internal plantar nerve= descends along the inner border of the\r\nsuperficial flexor tendon and divides near the middle of the metatarsus\r\ninto two branches. Of these, the internal branch constitutes the =first\r\nplantar common digital nerve= (N. dig. comm. plant. I). The outer branch\r\ndescends on the superficial flexor tendon and divides into three\r\n=plantar metatarsal nerves= (Nn. met. plant. II, III, IV), which unite\r\nwith the plantar common digital nerves. The =external plantar nerve=\r\npasses down between the flexor tendons, sends twigs to the muscles on\r\nthe plantar surface of the metatarsus, and divides into three =plantar\r\ncommon digital nerves= (Nn. dig. comm, plant. II, III, IV). These\r\ndescend with the deep plantar metatarsal arteries in the second, third,\r\nand fourth intermetatarsal spaces, receive the plantar metatarsal\r\nnerves, and divide into =plantar proper digital nerves=, which pass down\r\nthe opposed surfaces of the second to the fifth digits.\r\n\r\nThe =sympathetic system= presents few special features worthy of\r\nmention. The =superior cervical ganglion= lies above the ganglion\r\nnodosum close to the cranial base and internal to the origin of the\r\ninternal carotid and occipital arteries. It forms connections directly\r\nor through the carotid plexus with the last seven cranial and first\r\ncervical nerves. The =cervical trunk= unites with the vagus so\r\nintimately as to form a vago-sympathetic trunk. There may be a small\r\n=middle cervical ganglion= in front of the inferior cervical ganglion.\r\nThe latter is usually distinct from the first thoracic ganglion, which\r\nis stellate and lies on the longus colli opposite the second rib and\r\nintercostal space.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ÆSTHESIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE SENSE ORGANS AND COMMON INTEGUMENT\r\n\r\nThe =organs of the senses= (Organa sensuum) receive external stimuli and\r\nconduct impulses to the brain which result in sensations of sight,\r\nhearing, taste, smell, and touch. They consist essentially of specially\r\ndifferentiated cells, the neuro-epithelium, and a conduction path which\r\nis simple in the more generalized sense organs, elaborate in those which\r\nare highly specialized—the eye and the ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE SENSE ORGANS AND SKIN OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE EYE\r\n\r\nThe =eye= or =organ of vision= (Organon visus) in the broader sense of\r\nthe term comprises the eyeball or globe of the eye, the optic nerve, and\r\ncertain accessory organs associated therewith. The accessory organs\r\n(Organa oculi accessoria) are the orbital fasciæ and muscles, the\r\neyelids and conjunctiva, and the lacrimal apparatus. These structures\r\nwill be considered in the order in which they may be most conveniently\r\nexamined, taking the horse as a type. The bony walls of the orbit have\r\nbeen described in connection with the skull; the periorbita, a fibrous\r\nmembrane which incloses the eyeball together with its muscles, vessels,\r\nand nerves, may be appropriately included in the account of the fasciæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 551.—LEFT EYE OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _9_, Zygomatic arch; _10_, supraorbital depression; _12_, supraorbital\r\n    process; _27_, facial crest. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für\r\n    Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE EYELIDS AND CONJUNCTIVA\r\n\r\nThe =eyelids=, upper and lower (Palpebra superior et inferior), are\r\nmovable folds of integument situated in front of the eyeball. When\r\nclosed, they cover the entrance to the orbit and the anterior surface of\r\nthe eyeball. The upper lid is much more extensive and more movable than\r\nthe lower one, and its free edge is more concave. The interval between\r\nthe lids is termed the =palpebral fissure= (Rima palpebrarum). When the\r\neye is closed, it is an oblique slit about two inches (ca. 5 cm.) in\r\nlength; when open, it is biconvex in outline. The ends of the fissure\r\nare the =angles= or =canthi=, and are distinguished as =internal= or\r\n=nasal=, and =external= or =temporal= (Angulus oculi medialis,\r\nlateralis). The external angle is rounded when the eye is open, but the\r\ninternal angle is narrowed to form a ᑐ-shaped bay or recess, termed the\r\n=lacrimal lake= (Lacus lacrimalis). In this there is a rounded,\r\npigmented prominence known as the =lacrimal caruncle= (Caruncula\r\nlacrimalis); it is about the size of a small pea and is covered with\r\nmodified skin, connected with that of the inner commissure, from which\r\nproject a number of hairs provided with sebaceous glands. The lids unite\r\non either side and form the =commissures=, internal and external\r\n(Commissura palpebrarum medialis, lateralis). The =anterior surface= of\r\nthe lids (Facies anterior palpebrarum) is convex and presents a variable\r\nnumber of long tactile hairs in addition to the ordinary but very short\r\nhairs. A considerable number of tactile hairs are scattered over the\r\nlower part of the lower lid, but on the upper lid they are very scanty.\r\nThe infrapalpebral depression (Sulcus infrapalpebralis) indicates\r\nsomewhat indistinctly the limit of the lower lid. The upper lid is\r\nmarked by two furrows when raised. The =posterior surface= (Facies\r\nposterior palpebrarum) is adapted to the free surface of the eyeball and\r\nis covered by the palpebral conjunctiva. The free border of the lid is\r\nsmooth and usually black. It has a well defined posterior margin (Limbus\r\npalpebralis posterior), along which the ducts of the tarsal glands open.\r\nThe anterior margin (Limbus palpebralis anterior) bears stiff hairs\r\ntermed the cilia or eyelashes. On the upper lid the cilia are long and\r\nnumerous except at its inner third, where they are very small or absent.\r\nOn the lower lid the cilia are often scarcely distinguishable from the\r\nordinary hairs; in other cases they may be clearly seen except near the\r\nexternal canthus, and are much finer and shorter than those of the upper\r\nlid. The edge of each lid is pierced near the internal angle by a\r\nminute, slit-like opening, the =punctum lacrimalis=, which is the\r\nentrance to the lacrimal duct or canaliculus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 552.—VERTICAL, SECTION OF ANTERIOR PART OF EYE OF HORSE, WITH\r\n    LIDS HALF CLOSED.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Tarsal gland of upper lid; _2_, palpebral conjunctiva; _3_,\r\n    fornix conjunctivæ; _4_, levator palpebræ superioris; _5_,\r\n    orbicularis oculi; _6_, cornea; _7_, anterior chamber; _8_, iris;\r\n    _9_, _9′_, granula iridis; _10_, posterior chamber; _11_, ciliary\r\n    process; _12_, ciliary muscle; _13_, ciliary zone or suspensory lig.\r\n    of lens; _14_, chorioid; _15_, sclera; _16_, lens; _17_, root of\r\n    tactile hair. (After Bayer, Augenheilkunde.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Structure of the Eyelids.=—The skin of the eyelids is thin and freely\r\nmovable, except near the free edge, where it is more firmly attached.\r\nThe underlying subcutaneous tissue is destitute of fat. The =muscular\r\nlayer= consists chiefly of the elliptical bundles of the orbicularis\r\noculi, with which are associated fibers of the corrugator supercilii in\r\nthe upper lid and the malaris in the lower lid. At the inner side there\r\nis a fibrous band, the =palpebral ligament=, which is attached to the\r\nlacrimal tubercle and furnishes origin to some fibers of the\r\norbicularis. At the inner commissure a bundle detached from the\r\norbicularis passes inward behind the lacrimal sac, and is known as the\r\npars lacrimalis or Horner’s muscle. At the outer side an indistinct\r\npalpebral raphé occurs where fibers of the orbicularis decussate. The\r\n=fibrous layer= is thicker and denser along the free edge of the lid,\r\nforming here the =tarsus=. The tarsus furnishes insertion to a layer of\r\nunstriped muscle known as the tarsal muscle (of Müller). The =tarsal\r\nglands= (Glandulæ tarsales) are partly embedded in the deep face of the\r\ntarsus, and are visible when the lid is everted if the conjunctiva is\r\nnot too strongly pigmented. They are arranged in a linear series, close\r\ntogether, and with their long axes perpendicular to the free edge of\r\neach lid. In the upper lid they number forty-five to fifty; in the\r\nlower, thirty to thirty-five. Each consists of a tubular duct beset with\r\nnumerous alveoli, in which a fatty substance, the =palpebral sebum=, is\r\nsecreted. The =palpebral conjunctiva= lines the posterior surface of the\r\neyelids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 553.—PIECE OF UPPER EYELID, INNER SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cilia; _2_, limbus palp. posterior; _3_, tarsal glands. (After\r\n    Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 554.—CARTILAGE OF THIRD EYELID OF HORSE, CONVEX SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Gland; _2_, fat surrounding deep part of cartilage. (After\r\n    Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =conjunctiva= is the mucous membrane which lines the lids as\r\n=palpebral conjunctiva= (C. palpebrarum) and is reflected upon the\r\nanterior part of the eyeball as =bulbar conjunctiva= (C. bulbi); the\r\nline of reflection is termed the =fornix conjunctivæ=. The palpebral\r\npart is closely adherent to the tarsus, but is loosely attached further\r\nback. It is papillated and is covered with stratified cylindrical\r\nepithelium in which many goblet cells are present. In the fornix and its\r\nvicinity there are tubular glands (of Henle). Near the inner angle there\r\nare numerous lymph nodules. The conjunctiva of the outer part of the\r\nupper lid is pierced near the fornix by the orifices of the excretory\r\nducts of the lacrimal gland. The bulbar conjunctiva is loosely attached\r\nto the anterior part of the sclera and is pigmented in the vicinity of\r\nthe corneo-scleral junction. On the cornea it is represented by a\r\nstratified epithelium.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When the lids are in apposition, the conjunctiva (including the\r\n  epithelium of the cornea) forms a complete =conjunctival sac=, as the\r\n  capillary space between the lids and the eyeball is termed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =third eyelid= (Palpebra tertia) is situated at the inner angle of\r\nthe eye (Figs. 551, 556). It consists of a semilunar fold of the\r\nconjunctiva, known as the =membrana nictitans=, which covers and partly\r\nincloses a curved plate of hyaline cartilage. Its marginal part is thin\r\nand usually more or less pigmented. The cartilage has an elongated\r\nquadrilateral outline. The part of it which lies in the membrana is wide\r\nand thin. The deep part is narrower and thicker and is embedded in fat\r\nat the inner side of the eyeball. Numerous minute lymph nodules occur in\r\nthe membrana nictitans, and the deep part of the cartilage is surrounded\r\nby a gland which resembles the lacrimal gland in structure (Glandula\r\nsuperficialis palpebæ tertiæ).\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ordinarily the third eyelid extends very little over the inner end of\r\n  the cornea, but when the eyeball is strongly retracted (as in tetanus)\r\n  the membrana is protruded over it so as to measure about an inch (ca.\r\n  2 to 3 cm.) in its middle. This effect results from the pressure of\r\n  the eyeball and its muscles on the fat which surrounds the deep part\r\n  of the cartilage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =arteries= which chiefly supply the eyelids\r\nand conjunctiva are branches of the ophthalmic and facial arteries, and\r\nthe blood is drained away by corresponding veins. The =sensory nerves=\r\nare branches of the ophthalmic and maxillary divisions of the\r\ntrigeminus. The =motor nerves= to the orbicularis oculi, corrugator\r\nsupercilii, and malaris come from the facial nerve, the levator palpebræ\r\nsuperioris is innervated by the oculomotor, and the unstriped muscle of\r\nthe lids by the sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE LACRIMAL APPARATUS\r\n\r\nThe =lacrimal apparatus= (Apparatus lacrimalis) comprises: (1) the\r\nlacrimal gland, which secretes the clear lacrimal fluid; (2) the\r\nexcretory ducts of the gland; (3) the two lacrimal ducts or canaliculi,\r\nlacrimal sac, and naso-lacrimal duct, which receive the fluid and convey\r\nit to the nostril.\r\n\r\nThe =lacrimal gland= (Glandula lacrimalis) is situated between the\r\nsupraorbital process and the dorso-lateral surface of the eyeball (Fig.\r\n438). It is flattened, oval in outline, and measures about two inches\r\n(ca. 5 cm.) transversely and an inch or more (2.5 to 3 cm.) in the\r\nsagittal direction. Its upper face is convex and is related to the\r\nconcave lower surface of the supraorbital process. The lower face is\r\nconcave in adaptation to the eyeball, from which it is separated by the\r\nperiorbita. The =excretory ducts= (Ductuli excretorii) are very small\r\nand are twelve to sixteen in number; they open into the outer part of\r\nthe conjunctival sac along a line a little in front of the fornix\r\nconjunctivæ superior. In appearance and structure the gland resembles\r\nthe parotid. It receives its blood-supply chiefly from the lacrimal\r\nartery. The sensory nerve is the lacrimal, and the secretory fibers are\r\nderived from the sympathetic.\r\n\r\nThe =puncta lacrimalia= are the entrances to the two lacrimal ducts.\r\nEach is a fine slit-like opening (about 2 mm. long), situated close\r\nbehind the free edge of the lid and about a third of an inch (ca. 8 mm.)\r\nfrom the internal canthus. The =lacrimal ducts= (Ductus lacrimales),\r\nupper and lower, begin at the puncta and converge at the inner\r\ncommissure to open into the =lacrimal sac=. The latter (Saccus\r\nlacrimalis) may be regarded as the dilated origin of the naso-lacrimal\r\nduct. It occupies the funnel-like origin of the bony lacrimal canal, and\r\nleads to the =naso-lacrimal duct= (Ductus naso-lacrimalis), which passes\r\nforward and a little downward along the outer wall of the frontal sinus\r\nand the nasal cavity and opens near the lower commissure of the nostril.\r\nIts length is about ten to twelve inches (ca. 25 to 30 cm.). In the\r\nfirst part of its course it is inclosed in the osseous lacrimal canal;\r\nfurther forward it lies in the lacrimal groove of the maxilla, covered\r\nat first by a plate of cartilage and then by the mucous membrane of the\r\nmiddle meatus. The terminal part lies in the inferior turbinal fold and\r\nopens on the skin of the floor of the nostril near the transition to\r\nmucous membrane. Accessory openings may occur a little further back.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The first part of the duct, about 6 to 7 mm. in diameter, extends in a\r\n  gentle curve, convex dorsally, from the internal commissure toward a\r\n  point just above the level of the infraorbital foramen. The second\r\n  part (isthmus) is narrower (ca. 3 to 4 mm.); it extends forward and a\r\n  little ventrally about to a transverse plane through the first cheek\r\n  tooth and lies in the groove above the inferior turbinal crest. Beyond\r\n  this the duct inclines upward and widens very considerably, crosses\r\n  the nasal process of the premaxilla obliquely, and contracts at its\r\n  termination. The mucous membrane may present valvular folds, the most\r\n  distinct of which is situated at the origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE PERIORBITA\r\n\r\nThe =periorbita= or ocular sheath is a conical fibrous membrane which\r\nincloses the eyeball with its muscles, vessels, nerves, etc. Its apex is\r\nattached around the optic and lacerated foramina, and its base is in\r\npart attached to the bony rim of the orbit, in part continuous with the\r\nfibrous layer of the lids. Its inner part, which is in contact with the\r\norbital wall, is thin; incorporated with it beneath the root of the\r\nsupraorbital process is the bar of cartilage around which the superior\r\noblique muscle is reflected. The outer part is thicker, and is\r\nstrengthened by an elastic band which is attached to the pterygoid crest\r\nand furnishes origin to the thin unstriped orbital muscle. A quantity of\r\nfat (Corpus adiposum extraorbitale) lies about the periorbita, and\r\nwithin it is the intraorbital adipose tissue (Corpus adiposum\r\nintraorbitale) which fills the interstices between the eyeball, muscles,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\n      THE ORBITAL FASCIÆ AND OCULAR MUSCLES (Figs. 438, 439, 555)\r\n\r\nThe straight muscles of the eyeball and the oblique muscles in part are\r\ninclosed in fibrous sheaths (Fasciæ musculares), formed by superficial\r\nand deep layers of fascia, which are united by intermuscular septa in\r\nthe interstices between the muscles. The =superficial fascia= is thin;\r\nit blends in front with the fibrous layer of the eyelids and is attached\r\nbehind around the optic foramen. The =deep fascia= consists anteriorly\r\nof two layers, one of which is continuous with the fibrous tissue of the\r\nlids, while the other is attached at the corneo-scleral junction.\r\n\r\nThe posterior part of the eyeball is covered by the =bulbar fascia= or\r\ncapsule of Tenon (Fascia bulbi), so that between them a lymph space\r\n(Spatium interfasciale) is inclosed which communicates with the subdural\r\nspace along the course of the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nThe =levator palpebræ superioris= muscle[217] is a thin band about half\r\nan inch in width which lies above the rectus superior. It is narrow at\r\nits origin above and behind the ethmoidal foramen and ends by an\r\nexpanded tendon in the upper lid. Its action is to raise the upper lid.\r\n\r\nThe =recti oculi= (Mm. recti bulbi) are four in number and are\r\ndesignated according to their positions as =superior=, =inferior=,\r\n=internal=, and =external=. They are all band-like, arise close together\r\naround the optic foramen, and diverge as they pass forward to the\r\neyeball. On reaching the latter they end in thin tendons which are\r\ninserted into the sclera in front of the equator of the eyeball.\r\n\r\nThe =retractor oculi= (M. retractor bulbi) surrounds the optic nerve,\r\nand is incompletely divided into four parts which alternate with the\r\nrecti. They arise around the optic nerve and are inserted into the\r\nsclera behind the recti.\r\n\r\nThe =obliquus oculi superior= (M. obliquus bulbi dorsalis s. superior)\r\nis the longest and narrowest of the ocular muscles. It arises near the\r\nethmoidal foramen and passes forward internal to the rectus internus.\r\nUnder the root of the supraorbital process it is reflected almost at a\r\nright angle around a cartilaginous pulley (trochlea), which is attached\r\nto the anterior part of the inner wall of the orbit, a bursa being\r\ninterposed here. The muscle is then directed outward and somewhat\r\nforward, and ends in a thin tendon which passes between the rectus\r\nsuperior and the eyeball, and is inserted into the sclera between the\r\nsuperior and external recti, about half an inch behind the margin of the\r\ncornea.\r\n\r\nThe =obliquus oculi inferior= (M. obliquus bulbi ventralis s. inferior)\r\nis wide and much shorter than the recti. It arises from the inner wall\r\nof the orbit in the small depression (Fossa muscularis) behind the\r\nlacrimal fossa. It curves around the rectus inferior and is inserted\r\ninto the sclera near and partly beneath the rectus externus.\r\n\r\n=Actions.=—The superior and inferior recti rotate the eyeball about a\r\ntransverse axis, moving the vertex of the cornea upward and downward\r\nrespectively. Similarly the internal and external recti rotate the\r\neyeball about a vertical axis, turning the vertex of the cornea inward\r\nand outward respectively. The oblique muscles rotate the eyeball about a\r\nlongitudinal axis; the superior oblique raises the outer end of the\r\npupil, while the inferior oblique lowers it. The retractor as a whole\r\ndraws the eyeball backward, and its parts may separately reinforce the\r\ncorresponding recti. Also the four recti acting together will retract\r\nthe eyeball.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 555.—VERTICAL, AXIAL SECTION OF ORBIT OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Eyelids; _b_, bulbar fascia (Tenon’s capsule); _c_, _c′_,\r\n    retractor bulbi; _d_, rectus oculi inferior; _e_, obliquus oculi\r\n    inferior (in cross-section); _f_, rectus oculi superior; _g_,\r\n    levator palpebræ superioris; _h_, obliquus oculi superior (in\r\n    cross-section); _i_, lacrimal gland; _k_, _k′_, periorbita; _l_,\r\n    superficial fascia; _m_, deep fascia; _n_, skin; _o_, retrobulbar\r\n    fat; _p_, extraorbital fat; _q_, temporalis muscle; _r_,\r\n    supraorbital process; _s_, cranial wall; _1_, cornea; _2_, sclera;\r\n    _3_, chorioidea; _4_, ciliary muscle; _5_, iris; _6_, granula\r\n    iridis; _7_, retina; _7′_, optic papilla; _8_, optic nerve; _9_,\r\n    crystalline lens; _10_, capsule of lens; _11_, ciliary zone; _12_,\r\n    posterior chamber; _13_, anterior chamber; _14_, conjunctiva bulbi;\r\n    _15_, vitreous body. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  The actual movements of the eyeball are by no means so simple as might\r\n  be inferred from the foregoing general statements. Practically all\r\n  movements are produced by the coördinated actions of several muscles,\r\n  involving combinations which are quite complex and difficult to\r\n  analyze accurately. Further complication is caused by the fact that\r\n  the recti are not inserted at equal distances from the equator and the\r\n  axes of rotation of the oblique muscles do not correspond to the\r\n  longitudinal axis of the eyeball.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nerve-supply.=—The oculomotor nerve supplies the foregoing muscles,\r\nwith the exception of the rectus externus and obliquus superior, which\r\nare innervated by the abducens and trochlearis respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE EYEBALL\r\n\r\nThe =eyeball= (Bulbus oculi) is situated in the anterior part of the\r\norbital cavity, protected in front by the eyelids and conjunctiva, in\r\nits middle by the complete orbital ring, and related behind to the\r\nbulbar fascia, fat, and ocular muscles.\r\n\r\nIt has the form approximately of an oblate spheroid, but is composed of\r\nthe segments of two spheres of different sizes. The anterior,\r\ntransparent, corneal segment has a radius of curvature of about 17 mm.,\r\nand the posterior, opaque, scleral segment a radius of about 25 mm. The\r\nanterior segment therefore projects more strongly, and the junction of\r\nthe two segments is marked externally by a broad, shallow groove, the\r\nsulcus scleræ. The central points of the anterior and posterior\r\ncurvatures of the eyeball are termed respectively the =anterior= and\r\n=posterior poles= (Polus anterior, posterior), and the line connecting\r\nthe poles is the =optic axis= (Axis oculi externa). The angle of\r\ndivergence of the optic axes is about 137 degrees. The =equator=\r\n(Æquator) is an imaginary line drawn around the eyeball midway between\r\nits poles, and =meridians= (Meridiani) are lines drawn around it through\r\nthe poles.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The average transverse diameter of the eyeball is about 5 cm., the\r\n  vertical about 4.5 cm., and the axial about 4.25 cm. The distance from\r\n  the anterior pole to the point of entrance of the optic nerve is about\r\n  3 cm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 556.—LEFT EYEBALL OF HORSE, _in situ_, AFTER REMOVAL OF UPPER AND\r\n    LOWER LIDS.\r\n\r\n  _9_, Zygomatic arch; _12_, supraorbital process; _19_, orbital fat;\r\n    _27_, facial crest. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe eyeball consists of three concentric tunics or coats, within which\r\nthree refractive media are inclosed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE FIBROUS TUNIC\r\n\r\nThe =fibrous tunic= (Tunica fibrosa oculi) is the external coat and is\r\ncomposed of a posterior opaque part, the sclera, and a transparent\r\nanterior part, the cornea.\r\n\r\nThe =sclera=, popularly termed the “white of the eye,” is a dense\r\nfibrous membrane which forms about four-fifths of the fibrous tunic.\r\nThickest in the vicinity of the posterior pole (ca. 2 mm.), it thins at\r\nthe equator (ca. 0.4 mm.), and increases in thickness toward the\r\njunction with the cornea (ca. 1.3 mm.). It is in general white, but may\r\nhave a bluish tinge in its thinnest parts. Its external surface\r\nfurnishes insertion to the ocular muscles and is covered by the\r\nconjunctiva scleræ in its anterior part. The episcleral tissue, which is\r\nrichly supplied with vessels and nerves, attaches the conjunctiva to the\r\nsclera; it is abundant and loosely meshed except at the junction with\r\nthe cornea. The inner surface is attached to the chorioid coat by a\r\nlayer of delicate, pigmented, connective tissue, the =lamina fusca=. The\r\nanterior border is oval, the long axis being transverse, and is\r\ncontinuous with the cornea. The transition from the opaque scleral\r\ntissue to the transparent corneal substance occurs in such manner that\r\nthe sclera appears to form a groove (Rima cornealis), into which the\r\ncornea fits somewhat as a watch-glass in the case. Near the\r\ncorneo-scleral junction there is a circular venous plexus, the =plexus=\r\ns. =sinus venosus scleræ=, formerly called the canal of Schlemm. The\r\noptic nerve passes through the posterior part of the sclera a little\r\nbelow and external to the posterior pole. The opening for the nerve is\r\ncrossed by interlacing fibrous strands, forming the =lamina cribrosa\r\nscleræ=.\r\n\r\nThe sclera consists of interlacing bundles of white fibrous tissue,\r\nassociated with which there are a few elastic fibers. The bundles are\r\narranged chiefly in meridional and equatorial layers. The very limited\r\nblood-supply is derived from the ciliary arteries, and the veins open\r\ninto the venæ vorticosæ and ciliary veins. The lymphatics are\r\nrepresented by intercommunicating cell spaces. The nerves are derived\r\nfrom the ciliary nerves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 557.—VERTICAL SECTION OF EYEBALL OF HORSE, ABOUT ³⁄₂.\r\n\r\n  The contour of the crystalline lens is dotted.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =cornea= forms the anterior fifth of the fibrous tunic. It is\r\ntransparent, colorless, and non-vascular. Viewed from in front it is\r\noval in outline, the long axis being transverse and the broad end\r\ninternal; it appears more nearly circular when viewed from behind. Its\r\n=anterior surface= (Facies anterior) is convex and is more strongly\r\ncurved than the sclera; its central part is termed the =vertex corneæ=.\r\nThe =posterior surface= (Facies posterior) is concave; it forms the\r\nanterior boundary of the anterior chamber, and is in contact with the\r\naqueous humor. The margin (limbus corneæ) joins the sclera; the latter\r\noverlaps the cornea more in front than behind, and more above and below\r\nthan at the sides, thus explaining the difference in outline of the two\r\nsurfaces. The cornea is thinnest at the vertex.\r\n\r\nThe cornea consists, from before backward, of the following layers: (1)\r\nThe =epithelium corneæ= is continuous with that of the conjunctiva\r\nscleræ, and is of the stratified squamous type. (2) The =lamina limitans\r\nanterior= is merely a condensation of the next layer. (3) The\r\n=substantia propria= forms the bulk of the cornea and is composed of\r\ninterlacing bundles of connective tissue, arranged in part in lamellæ\r\ndisposed parallel with the surface. In the amorphous cement substance\r\nbetween the lamellæ are flattened connective-tissue cells, the corneal\r\ncorpuscles. These have branching processes which unite with those of\r\nother cells, thus forming a protoplasmic network.[218] (4) The =lamina\r\nelastica posterior=, also termed the membrane of Descemet or Demours, is\r\na thin and practically homogeneous membrane which is less intimately\r\nattached to the substantia propria than the anterior lamina. It is\r\nclear, glistening, and elastic. At the periphery the lamina divides into\r\nthree sets of fibers. The anterior fibers join the sclera, the middle\r\ngive attachment to the ciliary muscle, while the posterior pass into the\r\niris and form the =ligamentum pectinatum iridis=. (5) The =endothelium=\r\n(cameræ anterioris) consists of a layer of flattened polygonal cells,\r\nand is reflected on to the anterior surface of the iris.\r\n\r\nThe cornea is without =blood-vessels= except at its periphery, where the\r\nterminal twigs of the vessels of the sclera and conjunctiva terminate in\r\nloops. The =nerves= are derived from the ciliary nerves. They form a\r\nplexus around the periphery (Plexus annularis), from which fibers pass\r\ninto the substantia propria, become non-medullated, and form the\r\nfundamental or stroma plexus. From this perforating branches pass\r\nthrough the anterior limiting layer and form a subepithelial plexus,\r\nfrom which filaments ascend between the epithelial cells. Other branches\r\nfrom the plexuses in the substantia propria end as fibrils which are in\r\nclose relation with the corneal corpuscles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 558.—TAPETUM OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Optic papilla; _b_, lower border of tapetum. (After Ellenberger,\r\n    in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE VASCULAR TUNIC\r\n\r\nThe =vascular tunic= (Tunica vasculosa oculi) lies internal to the\r\nfibrous coat; it comprises three parts—the chorioid, the ciliary body,\r\nand the iris.\r\n\r\n1. The =chorioid= (Chorioidea) is a thin membrane which lies between the\r\nsclera and retina. It is in general rather loosely attached to the\r\nsclera by the lamina fusca, but is intimately adherent at the point of\r\nentrance of the optic nerve and less closely in places where the ciliary\r\nvessels and nerves pass through. The inner surface is in contact with\r\nthe layer of pigmented cells of the retina, which adhere so closely to\r\nthe chorioid that they were formerly regarded as a part of the latter.\r\nThe general color of the chorioid is dark brown, but an extensive\r\nsemilunar area a little above the level of the optic papilla has a\r\nremarkable metallic luster, and is termed the =tapetum= of the chorioid\r\n(Tapetum chorioideæ). The appearance here varies in different\r\nindividuals, but the prevailing colors in most cases are iridescent blue\r\nand green in various nuances shading into yellow. Posteriorly the\r\nchorioid is perforated by the optic nerve, and anteriorly it is\r\ncontinuous with the ciliary body.\r\n\r\nThe chorioid consists of four layers, which from without inward are as\r\nfollows: (1) The =lamina suprachorioidea= consists of interlacing fine\r\nlamellæ of fibrous tissue, each containing a network of elastic tissue.\r\nAmong these are large-branched, pigmented, connective-tissue cells. The\r\nspaces between the lamellæ are lined with endothelium, and form a system\r\nof lymph-clefts which together form the perichorioid space (Spatium\r\nperichorioideale). (2) The =lamina vasculosa= is the outer part of the\r\nproper tissue of the chorioid. It contains the larger blood-vessels,\r\nwhich are supported by connective-tissue and elastic fibers. (3) The\r\n=lamina choriocapillaris= consists of an extremely rich network of\r\ncapillaries embedded in an almost homogeneous matrix. Between it and the\r\nlamina vasculosa is a layer of fibro-elastic tissue, the =tapetum\r\nfibrosum=, which causes the metallic luster mentioned above. (4) The\r\n=lamina basalis= is very thin and transparent. It is composed of an\r\ninner homogeneous part and an outer elastic part.\r\n\r\n2. The =ciliary body= (Corpus ciliare), the middle part of the vascular\r\ncoat, connects the chorioid with the periphery of the iris. In\r\nmeridional section it has the form of a narrow triangle, the base of\r\nwhich is next to the iris. On its inner side are the ciliary processes\r\nand on its outer side the ciliary muscle. It consists of three parts—the\r\nciliary ring, ciliary processes, and ciliary muscle. The =ciliary ring=\r\n(Orbicularis ciliaris) is the posterior zone, which is distinguished\r\nfrom the chorioid mainly by its greater thickness and the absence of the\r\nchoriocapillaris. Its inner face presents numerous fine meridional\r\nridges, by the union of which the ciliary processes are formed. The\r\n=ciliary processes= (Processus ciliares), more than a hundred in number,\r\nform a circle of radial folds which surround the lens and furnish\r\nattachment to the zonula ciliaris or suspensory ligament of the latter.\r\nThey are small at their origin on the ciliary ring and become much\r\nthicker and higher toward their inner ends. The width of the circle\r\nformed by them is narrower at the inner side than elsewhere. Their bases\r\nextend forward to the periphery of the iris, and their inner ends are\r\nclose to the margin of the lens. They bear numerous secondary folds.\r\nTheir inner surface is covered by a continuation of the lamina basalis\r\nof the chorioid, on which there are two layers of epithelial cells which\r\nconstitute the pars ciliaris retinæ. They consist of a rich network of\r\ntortuous vessels supported in pigmented connective tissue. The =ciliary\r\nmuscle= (M. ciliaris) (Figs. 552, 555, 559) constitutes the outer part\r\nof the ciliary body, and lies between the sclera and the ciliary\r\nprocesses. It forms a circular band of unstriped muscle, the fibers of\r\nwhich are for the most part directed meridionally. They arise from the\r\ninner surface of the sclera and from the ligamentum pectinatum iridis\r\nclose to the corneo-scleral junction, and run backward along the sclera\r\nto be inserted into the ciliary processes and ring. When the muscle\r\ncontracts, it pulls the processes and ring forward, thus slackening the\r\nciliary zone or suspensory ligament of the lens, and allowing the latter\r\nto become more convex. This is the mechanism of accommodation for near\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 559.—VASCULAR TUNIC OF EYEBALL OF HORSE, FRONT VIEW.\r\n\r\n  The cornea is removed and the sclera is reflected in flaps. _1_,\r\n    Sclera; _1′_, lamina fusca; _2_, chorioidea; _2′_, ciliary veins;\r\n    _3_, ciliary muscle; _4_, iris; _5_, _5′_, granula iridis; _6_,\r\n    pupil, through which the lens is visible. (After Ellenberger, in\r\n    Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  In man the muscle has the form of a prismatic ring which is triangular\r\n  in meridional section, the base being directed toward the periphery of\r\n  the iris. It consists chiefly of meridional fibers, but a ring of\r\n  circular fibers forms the inner angle of its base. In the horse the\r\n  muscle is much less developed, and has the form of a flat band; it\r\n  does not contain circular fibers, but the arrangement is rendered more\r\n  or less plexiform by the existence of oblique and equatorial fibers.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. The =iris= (Figs. 552, 557, 559) is a muscular diaphragm placed in\r\nfront of the lens, and is visible through the cornea. It is pierced\r\ncentrally by an elliptical opening, the =pupil= (Pupilla), which varies\r\nin size during life and determines the amount of light admitted to act\r\non the retina. In strong light the vertical diameter of the pupil is\r\nvery short, but the opening is almost circular when the pupil is fully\r\ndilated. The =ciliary border= (Margo ciliaris) or periphery of the iris\r\nis continuous with the ciliary body and is connected with the\r\ncorneo-scleral junction by the ligamentum pectinatum iridis. The\r\nligament consists of strands of connective tissue which are attached\r\nexternally to the corneo-scleral junction. Its bundles interlace and\r\ninclose spaces (Spatia anguli iridis) which are lined with endothelium\r\nand communicate with the anterior chamber. The =pupillary border= (Margo\r\npupillaris) surrounds the pupil. Its upper part bears in its middle\r\nseveral black masses of variable size, termed the =granula iridis= or\r\ncorpora nigra; similar, but much smaller, projections may be seen on the\r\nlower margin of the pupil. The =anterior surface= (Facies anterior)\r\ndetermines the color of the eye, which is dark brown usually. It is\r\nmarked by delicate concentric lines (Plicæ iridis), which fade out near\r\nthe pupil. The smooth, narrow, central part is termed the pupillary zone\r\nor annulus iridis minor, while the much broader plicated part is the\r\nciliary zone or annulus iridis major. The =posterior surface= (Facies\r\nposterior) is usually black. It bears numerous fine radial lines except\r\nat the pupillary margin. Its central part is in contact with the\r\nanterior surface of the lens, but peripherally the two are separated by\r\na narrow space termed the posterior chamber. The iris consists chiefly\r\nof the =stroma iridis=, a delicate framework of connective tissue, which\r\nsupports numerous blood-vessels, and contains branched pigmented cells.\r\nThe muscular tissue (unstriped) consists of a sphincter and a dilator of\r\nthe pupil. The =sphincter pupillæ= lies in the posterior part around the\r\npupil, with which the fibers are largely concentric. The =dilatator\r\npupillæ= consists of fibers which radiate outward from the sphincter to\r\nthe ciliary border. The anterior surface of the iris is covered by a\r\ncontinuation of the endothelium of the cornea. Beneath this is a\r\ncondensation of the stroma, in which the cells are close together and\r\nare full of pigmented granules.[219] There appear to be minute clefts\r\nhere by which the lymph-spaces of the stroma communicate with the\r\nanterior chamber. The posterior surface is covered by a pigmented\r\nepithelium, the stratum pigmenti iridis, which is a continuation of that\r\nof the ciliary body.\r\n\r\nThe =arteries= of the vascular tunic come from the ciliary branches of\r\nthe ophthalmic artery. The arteries of the chorioidea are derived\r\nchiefly from the short posterior ciliary arteries. These perforate the\r\nsclera around the posterior pole, run forward in the lamina vasculosa,\r\nand form the rich capillary network of the choriocapillaris. The two\r\nlong ciliary arteries perforate the sclera obliquely near the optic\r\nnerve; they run forward in the lamina suprachorioidea in the horizontal\r\nmeridian, one on the inner, the other on the outer, side of the eyeball.\r\nOn reaching the ciliary body each divides into diverging branches; the\r\nsubdivisions of these unite with each other and with twigs of the\r\nanterior ciliary arteries to form a circular anastomosis, the =circulus\r\narteriosus major=. From this branches go to the ciliary muscle and\r\nprocesses and to the iris. The two anterior ciliary arteries, dorsal and\r\nventral, form an episcleral plexus around the corneo-scleral junction,\r\nand give off branches which perforate the sclera. These supply twigs to\r\nthe ciliary muscle and recurrent branches to the chorioid, and assist in\r\nforming the circulus arteriosus major.\r\n\r\nThe blood is carried away from the vascular tunic chiefly by four or\r\nfive venous trunks, the =venæ vorticosæ=, which are formed by the\r\nconvergence in whorls of numerous veins, coming not only from the\r\nchorioid, but also from the ciliary body and iris. The venæ vorticosæ\r\nperforate the sclera about at the equator and join the veins of the\r\nocular muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =nerves= come from the long and short ciliary nerves. They form a\r\nplexus in the lamina suprachorioidea, which contains ganglion cells, and\r\nsends numerous non-medullated fibers chiefly to the blood-vessels of the\r\nchorioid. At the ciliary muscle a second plexus (P. gangliosus ciliaris)\r\nis formed, which supplies the muscle and sends fibers to the iris. The\r\nsphincter pupillæ is supplied by fibers derived from the oculomotor\r\nnerve, while the dilatator pupillæ is innervated by the sympathetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE RETINA\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 560.—INNER SURFACE OF ANTERIOR PART OF EYEBALL OF HORSE\r\n    (EQUATORIAL SECTION).\r\n\r\n  _1_, Sclera; _2_, chorioidea; _3_, retina (drawn away from\r\n    chorioidea); _4_, ciliary processes; _5_, crystalline lens, through\r\n    which the pupil (_6_) is seen.

(After Ellenberger, in\r\n    Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =retina= or nervous tunic of the eyeball is a delicate membrane\r\nwhich extends from the entrance of the optic nerve to the margin of the\r\npupil. It consists of three parts. The large posterior part, which alone\r\ncontains the nervous elements, including the special neuro-epithelium\r\nand the optic nerve-fibers, is termed the =pars optica retinæ=. It\r\nextends forward to the ciliary body, where it terminates at an irregular\r\nline called the =ora serrata=. Here the retina rapidly loses its nervous\r\nelements, becomes much thinner, and is continued over the ciliary body\r\nand the posterior surface of the iris by two layers of epithelial cells.\r\nIn the =pars ciliaris retinæ= the inner stratum is non-pigmented, while\r\nthe outer layer is a direct continuation of the stratum pigmenti of the\r\npars optica. In the =pars iridica retinæ= both are pigmented. In the\r\ndead subject the pars optica is an opaque, gray, soft membrane which can\r\nbe stripped of the chorioid, leaving most of its outer pigmented layer\r\non the latter. During life it is transparent, except as to its pigmented\r\nepithelium, and the reddish appearance of the fundus as viewed by the\r\nophthalmoscope is caused by the blood in the network of the\r\nchoriocapillaris. The entrance of the optic nerve forms a sharply\r\ndefined, oval, light area, the =optic papilla= (Papilla nervi optici),\r\nsituated about 15 mm. below the horizontal meridian and 3 to 4 mm.\r\nexternal to the vertical meridian. The central part of the papilla is\r\nslightly depressed (Excavatio papillæ n. optici).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The transverse diameter of the papilla is about 6 to 7 mm., and the\r\n  vertical about 4 to 5 mm. It is commonly situated a little below the\r\n  margin of the tapetum, but the latter may extend down somewhat on\r\n  either side of the papilla. The lower margin is often indented a\r\n  little. In inspection of the fundus with the ophthalmoscope numerous\r\n  fine branches of the arteria centralis retinæ are seen radiating from\r\n  the periphery of the papilla.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe optic nerve-fibers converge from all parts of the pars optica to the\r\npapilla, where they collect into bundles which traverse the lamina\r\ncribrosa of the chorioidea and sclera, and constitute the optic nerve.\r\nThe =area centralis retinæ= is a round spot, 2 to 3 mm. in diameter,\r\nsituated above and external to the optic papilla; it corresponds to the\r\nmacula lutea of man, which is histologically more highly differentiated\r\nthan the rest of the retina and is the area of most acute vision.\r\n\r\nThe =structure= of the retina is very complex. It consists of nervous\r\nelements which are supported in a peculiar sustentacular tissue, and are\r\ncovered externally by a layer of pigmented epithelium (Stratum pigmenti\r\nretinæ). The nervous elements comprise a highly specialized\r\nneuro-epithelium, the rods and cones; ganglion cells, the axones of\r\nwhich form the optic nerve; and intermediate neurones. Ten layers may be\r\nrecognized in sections microscopically.[220]\r\n\r\nThe =arteries= of the retina are derived from the arteria centralis\r\nretinæ and anastomotic branches from the short ciliary arteries. The\r\narteria centralis enters the optic nerve a short distance behind the\r\neyeball and runs in the axis of the nerve. The artery divides 2 to 3 mm.\r\nbefore reaching the papilla, and gives off thirty to forty branches\r\nwhich radiate in the posterior part of the retina and divide\r\ndichotomously into end-arteries. The anterior part of the retina is\r\nnon-vascular. The veins accompany the arteries except in the capillary\r\nplexuses; their walls consist merely of a layer of endothelial cells,\r\naround which are a lymph-channel and sheath.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CHAMBERS OF THE EYE AND AQUEOUS HUMOR\r\n\r\nThe =anterior chamber= of the eye (Camera oculi anterior) is inclosed in\r\nfront by the cornea and behind by the iris and lens (Figs. 552, 555,\r\n557). It communicates through the pupil with the =posterior chamber=\r\n(Camera oculi posterior); this is a small annular space, triangular in\r\ncross-section, which is bounded in front by the iris, behind by the\r\nperipheral part of the lens and its ligament, and externally by the\r\nciliary processes. The chambers are filled by the =aqueous humor= (Humor\r\naqueus), a clear fluid which consists of about 98 per cent. of water,\r\nwith a little sodium chlorid and traces of albumin and extractives. It\r\nis carried off chiefly through the spaces (of Fontana) in the zonula\r\nciliaris or suspensory ligament of the lens into the plexus venosus\r\nscleræ.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    REFRACTIVE MEDIA OF THE EYEBALL\r\n\r\nThe =vitreous body= (Corpus vitreum) is a semifluid transparent\r\nsubstance situated between the crystalline lens and the retina. In front\r\nit presents a deep cavity, the =fossa hyaloidea=, which receives the\r\nposterior surface of the lens. It consists of a framework of delicate\r\nfibrils, the =stroma vitreum=, the meshes of which are filled by the\r\nfluid =humor vitreus=. The surface is covered by a condensation of the\r\nstroma known as the membrana hyaloidea.\r\n\r\nThe =crystalline lens= (Lens crystallina) is a biconvex, transparent\r\nbody, situated in front of the vitreous body and in partial contact with\r\nthe posterior surface of the iris. Its periphery, the =æquator lentis=,\r\nis almost circular and is closely surrounded by the ciliary processes.\r\nThe =anterior surface= (Facies anterior) is convex; it is bathed by the\r\naqueous humor and is in contact with the iris to an extent which varies\r\nwith the state of the pupil. The =posterior surface= (Facies posterior)\r\nis much more strongly curved than the anterior. It rests in the fossa of\r\nthe vitreous body. The central points of the surfaces are the =anterior=\r\nand =posterior poles= (Polus anterior et posterior lentis), and the line\r\nwhich connects them is the axis of the lens (Axis lentis).\r\n\r\n\r\n  The transverse diameter of the lens is about 2 cm., the vertical\r\n  diameter is slightly smaller, and the axis measures about 13 mm. The\r\n  radius of curvature of the anterior surface is 13.5 mm., and of the\r\n  posterior surface 9.5 to 10 mm. But the curvatures of its\r\n  surfaces—especially that of the anterior—vary during life according as\r\n  the eye is accommodated for near or far vision.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =zonula ciliaris= (of Zinn) or suspensory ligament of the lens (Fig.\r\n552) consists of delicate fibers (Fibræ zonulares) which pass in a\r\nmeridional direction from the ciliary processes to the capsule of the\r\nequator of the lens. Many fibers cross each other, and the spaces\r\nbetween the fibers (Spatia zonularia) are filled with aqueous humor;\r\nthey communicate with each other and with the posterior chamber.\r\n\r\nThe =substance= of the lens (Substantia lentis) is inclosed by a\r\nstructureless, highly elastic membrane, the =capsule= of the lens\r\n(Capsula lentis), and consists of a softer =substantia corticalis=, and\r\na dense central part, the =nucleus lentis=. The capsule is thickest on\r\nthe anterior surface, and here it is lined by a layer of flat polygonal\r\ncells, the epithelium of the lens capsule. The lens substance, when\r\nhardened, is seen to consist of concentric laminæ arranged somewhat like\r\nthe layers of an onion, and united by an amorphous cement substance. The\r\nlaminæ consist of lens fibers, hexagonal in section, and of very\r\ndifferent lengths. Faint lines radiate from the poles and indicate the\r\nedges of layers of cement substance which unite the groups of lens\r\nfibers. These lines, the =radii lentis=, are three in number in the\r\nfœtus and new-born, and form with each other angles of 120 degrees. On\r\nthe anterior surface one is directed upward from the pole and the other\r\ntwo diverge downward; on the posterior surface one is directed downward\r\nand the others diverge upward. The developed lens has neither vessels\r\nnor nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the fœtus the lens is nearly globular, and is soft and pinkish in\r\n  color. During part of fœtal life it is surrounded by a vascular\r\n  network, the tunica vasculosa lentis. This is derived chiefly from a\r\n  temporary vessel, the hyaloid artery, which is a continuation forward\r\n  of the arteria centralis retinæ through the hyaloid canal that\r\n  traverses the vitreous body. In old age the lens tends to lose its\r\n  elasticity and transparency; it also becomes flatter and the nucleus\r\n  especially grows denser.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE EAR\r\n\r\nThe ear or organ of hearing (Organon auditus) consists of three natural\r\ndivisions—external, middle, and internal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE EXTERNAL EAR\r\n\r\nThe =external ear= (Auris externa) comprises (1) the =auricula=, a\r\nfunnel-like organ which collects the sound waves, together with its\r\nmuscles, and (2) the =external auditory canal=, which conveys these\r\nwaves to the tympanic membrane, the partition which separates the canal\r\nfrom the cavity of the middle ear.\r\n\r\nThe =auricula= or pinna is attached by its base around the external\r\nauditory canal in such a manner as to be freely movable. In the\r\nfollowing description it will be assumed that the opening is directed\r\noutward and that the long axis is practically vertical. It has two\r\nsurfaces, two borders, a base, and an apex. The convex surface or dorsum\r\n(Dorsum auriculæ) faces inward and is widest in its middle part; its\r\nlower part is almost circular in curvature, while above it narrows and\r\nflattens. The concave surface (Scapha) is the reverse of the dorsum; it\r\npresents several ridges which subside toward the apex. The anterior\r\nborder is sinuous; it is largely convex, but becomes concave near the\r\napex. It divides below into two diverging parts (crura helicis). The\r\nposterior border is convex. The apex is flattened, pointed, and curved a\r\nlittle forward. The base is strongly convex. It is attached to the\r\nexternal auditory process of the petrous temporal bone, and around this\r\nthere is a quantity of fat. The parotid gland overlaps it below and\r\nexternally. The structure of the external ear comprises a framework of\r\ncartilages (which are chiefly elastic), the integument, and a\r\ncomplicated arrangement of muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =conchal= or =auricular cartilage= (Cartilago auriculæ) determines\r\nthe shape of the ear; its form can be made out without dissection,\r\nexcept below, where it is concealed by the muscles and the parotid\r\ngland. The basal part is coiled to form a tube, which incloses the\r\ncavity of the concha (Cavum conchæ). This part is funnel-shaped and\r\ncurves outward and a little backward. Its internal (medial) surface is\r\nstrongly convex, forming a prominence termed the =eminentia conchæ=. The\r\nlowest part of the internal margin bears a narrow, pointed prolongation,\r\nthe =styloid process=. This process is about an inch long and projects\r\ndownward externally over the annular cartilage; the guttural pouch is\r\nattached to its free end. Behind its base there is a foramen through\r\nwhich the auricular branch of the vagus passes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The basal part of the posterior border is cut into by a notch, which\r\n  separates two irregular quadrilateral plates. The upper plate (Tragus)\r\n  is overlapped by the anterior border, and is separated from the\r\n  adjacent part of the posterior border (Antitragus) by a notch\r\n  (Incisura intertragica). The lower plate is curved to form a half ring\r\n  and partly overlaps the anterior border and the annular cartilage.\r\n  Behind the notch there is a foramen, which transmits the internal\r\n  auricular artery and internal auricular branch of the facial nerve.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 562.—CONCHAL AND ANNULAR CARTILAGES OF EAR OF HORSE, EXTERNAL\r\n    VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Base of concha; _2_, posterior border, _3_, anterior border of\r\n    concha; _4_, intertragic notch; _5_, eminentia conchæ; _6_, styloid\r\n    process; _7_, annular cartilage; _9_, zygomatic arch. (After\r\n    Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =annular cartilage= (Cartilago annularis) is a quadrilateral plate,\r\ncurved to form about three-fourths of a ring; its ends are a little less\r\nthan half an inch (ca. 1 cm.) apart internally and are united by elastic\r\ntissue. It embraces the external auditory process and forms with the\r\nlower part of the conchal cartilage the cartilaginous part of the\r\nexternal auditory canal.\r\n\r\nThe =scutiform cartilage= (Cartilago scutiformis s. scutulum) is an\r\nirregular quadrilateral plate which lies on the temporal muscle in front\r\nof the base of the conchal cartilage. Its superficial face is slightly\r\nconvex from side to side and its deep face is correspondingly concave.\r\nThe anterior end is thin and rounded; the posterior part or base is\r\nwider and thicker, and its inner angle is prolonged by a pointed process\r\nhalf an inch or more in length. The cartilage moves very freely over the\r\nunderlying parts.\r\n\r\nThe =external auditory canal= or =meatus= leads from the cavum conchæ to\r\nthe tympanic membrane. It does not continue the general direction of the\r\ncavity of the concha, but extends inward, downward, and slightly\r\nforward. It consists of a cartilaginous part formed by the lower part of\r\nthe conchal cartilage and the annular cartilage, and an osseous part\r\nformed by the external auditory process of the temporal bone. These are\r\nunited by elastic membranes to form a complete tube. Its caliber\r\ndiminishes from without inward, so that the lumen of the inner end is\r\nabout half of that of the outer end.\r\n\r\nThe =skin= on the convex surface of the concha presents no special\r\nfeatures; it is attached to the cartilage by a considerable amount of\r\nsubcutaneous tissue except at the apex. The integument which lines the\r\nconcave surface is intimately adherent to the cartilage and is\r\nrelatively dark in color. There are three or four cutaneous ridges which\r\nrun about parallel with the borders of the conchal cartilage, but do not\r\nextend to the apex or the cavum conchæ. The upper and marginal parts and\r\nthe ridges are covered with long hairs, but between the ridges and below\r\nit is thin, covered sparsely with very fine hairs, and supplied with\r\nnumerous sebaceous glands. In the external auditory canal the skin\r\nbecomes thinner; in the cartilaginous part it is supplied with numerous\r\nlarge, coiled, =ceruminous glands= (Glandulæ ceruminosæ) and is sparsely\r\ncovered with very fine hairs; in the osseous part the glands are small\r\nand few or absent and there are no hairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE AURICULAR MUSCLES\r\n\r\nThe =auricular muscles= may be subdivided into two sets, viz., (_a_)\r\nextrinsic muscles, which arise on the head and adjacent part of the\r\nneck, and move the external ear as a whole, and (_b_) intrinsic muscles,\r\nwhich are confined to the auricula. In this connection the scutiform\r\ncartilage may be regarded as a sesamoid cartilage intercalated in the\r\ncourse of some of the muscles.\r\n\r\nThe =extrinsic muscles= are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =scutularis= is a thin muscular sheet situated subcutaneously\r\nover the temporalis muscle. Its fibers arise from the zygomatic arch and\r\nthe frontal and sagittal crests, and converge to the scutiform\r\ncartilage. It consists of three parts.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =fronto-scutularis= comprises temporal and frontal parts,\r\nwhich arise from the zygomatic arch and the frontal crest, and are\r\ninserted into the outer and anterior borders of the scutiform cartilage\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =interscutularis= arises from the sagittal crest, over which\r\nit is in part continuous with the muscle of the opposite side. Its\r\nfibers converge to the inner border of the scutiform cartilage.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The =cervico-scutularis= is not well defined from the preceding\r\nmuscle. It arises from the occipital crest and is inserted into the\r\ninner border of the scutiform cartilage.\r\n\r\n2. The =anterior auricular muscles= (Mm. auriculares nasales) are four\r\nin number.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =zygomatico-auricularis= arises from the zygomatic arch and\r\nthe parotid fascia, and is inserted into the outer face of the base of\r\nthe conchal cartilage under cover of the parotido-auricularis.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =scutulo-auricularis superficialis inferior= arises on the\r\nouter part of the superficial face of the scutiform cartilage and ends\r\non the base of the conchal cartilage with the preceding muscle.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The =scutulo-auricularis superficialis medius= arises from the\r\nposterior part of the deep surface of the scutiform cartilage and is\r\ninserted into the dorsum of the conchal cartilage, close to the lower\r\npart of its anterior border and above and behind the preceding muscle.\r\nIt receives a slip from the cervico-scutularis.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The =scutulo-auricularis superficialis superior= is a thin slip\r\nwhich is detached from the interscutularis over the inner border of the\r\nscutiform cartilage. It ends on the anterior aspect of the lower part of\r\nthe dorsum of the conchal cartilage.\r\n\r\n3. The =superior auricular muscles= (Mm. auriculares dorsales) are two\r\nin number.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =scutulo-auricularis superficialis accessorius= is a narrow\r\nband which is largely covered by the preceding muscle. It arises from\r\nthe posterior prolongation and the adjacent part of the superficial face\r\nof the scutiform cartilage, and is inserted into the convex surface of\r\nthe conchal cartilage internal to the preceding muscle, the two crossing\r\neach other at an acute angle.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =parieto-auricularis= is flat and triangular; it arises from\r\nthe sagittal crest under cover of the cervico-scutularis, runs outward\r\nand a little backward, and is inserted by a flat tendon into the lower\r\npart of the convex surface of the concha under cover of the\r\ncervico-auricularis superficialis.\r\n\r\n4. The =posterior auricular muscles= (Mm. auriculares caudales) are\r\nthree in number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 563.—EXTERNAL EAR OF HORSE AND ITS MUSCLES, LATERAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _2_, Posterior border; _3_, anterior border of auricula; _8_,\r\n    scutiform cartilage; _9_, zygomatic arch; _n_, parotido-auricularis;\r\n    _o_, zygomatico-auricularis; _o′_, scutulo-auricularis superficialis\r\n    inferior; _o″_, scutulo-auricularis superficialis medius et\r\n    superior; _p_, interscutularis; _p′_, fronto-scutularis (pars\r\n    temporalis); _q_, cervico-auricularis profundus major; _s_, small\r\n    (or anterior) oblique muscle of head; _t_, splenius; _y_, tendon of\r\n    mastoido-humeralis; _c_, mastoido-humeralis; _x_, wing of atlas.\r\n    (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =cervico-auricularis superficialis= is a thin triangular\r\nsheet. It is wide at its origin from the occipital crest and the\r\nadjacent part of the ligamentum nuchæ, and becomes narrower as it passes\r\noutward to be inserted into the inner side of the convex surface of the\r\nconcha.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =cervico-auricularis profundus major= arises from the\r\nligamentum nuchæ, partly beneath and partly behind the preceding muscle.\r\nIt is directed outward and is inserted into the postero-external aspect\r\nof the base of the ear, partly under cover of the parotido-auricularis.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The =cervico-auricularis profundus minor= arises under the\r\npreceding muscle and passes downward and outward to be inserted into the\r\nlowest part of the convex surface of the concha, partly under cover of\r\nthe parotid gland.\r\n\r\n5. The =parotido-auricularis= (s. M. auricularis inferior) is a\r\nribbon-like muscle which lies on the parotid gland. It is thin and wide\r\nat its origin from the fascia on the lower part of the parotid gland and\r\nbecomes somewhat narrower and thicker as it passes upward. It is\r\ninserted into the conchal cartilage just below the angle of junction of\r\nits borders.\r\n\r\n6. The =deep auricular= or =rotator muscles= (M. auriculares profundis,\r\nrotatores auriculæ), two in number, are situated under the scutiform\r\ncartilage and the base of the concha and cross each other.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The =scutulo-auricularis profundus major= is the strongest of the\r\nauricular muscles. It is flat and is about an inch wide. It arises from\r\nthe deep face of the scutiform cartilage and passes backward to end on\r\nand below the most prominent part of the base of the concha (eminentia\r\nconchæ).\r\n\r\n(_b_) The =scutulo-auricularis profundus minor= lies between the base of\r\nthe concha and the preceding muscle, and is best seen when the latter is\r\ncut and reflected. It is flat and about an inch in length. It arises\r\nfrom the posterior part of the deep face of the scutiform cartilage and\r\nfrom the cervico-scutularis, and passes downward, backward, and outward\r\nto be inserted into the base of the concha under cover of the preceding\r\nmuscle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 564.—MUSCLES OF EXTERNAL EAR OF HORSE, VIEWED FROM ABOVE.\r\n\r\n  On the right side parts of the superficial muscles have been removed\r\n    and the scutiform cartilage turned back to display the\r\n    deeper muscles. _a_, Frontal part, _a′_, temporal part of\r\n    fronto-scutularis; _b_, interscutularis; _c_, cervico-scutularis;\r\n    _d_, _e_, scutulo-auricularis superficialis superior and medius;\r\n    _f_, zygomatico-auricularis; _g_, scutulo-auricularis superficialis\r\n    accessorius; _o_, cervico-auricularis superficialis; _q_,\r\n    scutulo-auricularis superficialis inferior; _t_, scutiform\r\n    cartilage; _u_, parieto-auricularis; _v_, cervico-auricularis\r\n    profundus major; _w_, cervico-auricularis prof. minor; _x_, _x′_,\r\n    scutulo-auricularis prof. major et minor; _y_, temporalis.\r\n    (Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. d. Haustiere.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n7. The =tragicus= or mastoido-auricularis is a small muscle which arises\r\nfrom the temporal bone just behind the external auditory process and\r\nfrom the annular cartilage; it passes upward to be inserted into the\r\nlower part of the anterior border of the conchal cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =intrinsic muscles= are very small and of little importance. They\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The =antitragicus= consists of a few bundles which are attached to\r\nthe conchal cartilage behind the junction of its two borders, and are\r\npartially blended with the insertion of the parotido-auricularis.\r\n\r\n2. The =helicis= is a small muscle attached in a position opposite to\r\nthe preceding on the anterior border of the conchal cartilage; it\r\nextends also into the depression between the two divisions of the\r\nborder. It is in part continuous with the insertion of the\r\nparotido-auricularis.\r\n\r\n3. The =verticalis auriculæ=[221] is a thin stratum of muscular and\r\ntendinous fibers which extends upward on the posterior surface of the\r\nconcha from the eminentia conchæ.\r\n\r\n=Actions.=—The base of the concha is rounded and rests in a pad of fat\r\n(Corpus adiposum auriculæ), so that the movements of the external ear\r\nresemble those of a ball-and-socket joint. It is noticeable that\r\nmovements about the longitudinal and transverse axes are accompanied by\r\nrotation. When the ear is vertical or drawn forward (“pricked up”), the\r\nopening is usually directed forward; conversely, when the ears are “laid\r\nback,” the opening faces backward. These movements evidently result from\r\nthe coördinated actions of several muscles which are very complex and\r\ncannot be discussed in detail here. The scutularis acting as a whole\r\nfixes the scutiform cartilage, so that the muscles which arise on the\r\nlatter act efficiently on the concha. The anterior auricular muscles in\r\ngeneral erect the ear and turn the opening forward. The interscutularis\r\nconcurs in this action, causing adduction and a symmetrical position of\r\nthe ears; it also acts directly on the conchal cartilage, since the\r\nscutulo-auricularis superficialis superior is in reality a conchal\r\ninsertion of the interscutularis. The scutulo-auricularis superficialis\r\naccessorius draws the concha forward and turns the opening outward. The\r\nparieto-auricularis adducts the concha and inclines it forward. The\r\ncervico-auricularis superficialis is chiefly an adductor of the conchal\r\ncartilage, and directs the opening outward. The cervico-auricularis\r\nprofundus major turns the opening outward and, acting with the\r\nparotido-auricularis, inclines the ear toward the poll. The\r\ncervico-auricularis profundus minor tends to direct the opening downward\r\nand outward. The parotido-auricularis draws the ear downward and\r\nbackward, and acts with the cervico-auricularis profundus major in\r\n“laying back the ears”; the deep auricular muscles concur in these\r\nactions. The tragicus shortens the external auditory canal. The actions\r\nof the intrinsic muscles are inappreciable.\r\n\r\nThe =arteries= of the external ear are derived from the anterior\r\nauricular branch of the superficial temporal, the posterior or great\r\nauricular branch of the internal maxillary, and the anterior branch of\r\nthe occipital artery.\r\n\r\nThe =motor nerves= to the muscles come from the auricular and\r\nauriculo-palpebral branches of the facial nerve and from the first and\r\nsecond cervical nerves. The sensory nerves are supplied by the\r\nsuperficial temporal branch of the mandibular nerve and the auricular\r\nbranch of the vagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE MIDDLE EAR\r\n\r\nThe =middle ear= (Auris media) or =tympanic cavity= (Cavum tympani) is a\r\nspace in the tympanic and petrous parts of the temporal bone situated\r\nbetween the membrana tympani and the internal ear. It is a pneumatic\r\ncavity, which is lined by mucous membrane, and communicates with the\r\npharynx and the guttural pouch by the Eustachian tube. It contains a\r\nchain of auditory ossicles by which the vibrations of the membrana\r\ntympani are transmitted to the internal ear.\r\n\r\nThe cavity consists of: (1) A main part or atrium, which lies\r\nimmediately to the inner side of the membrana tympani; (2) the recessus\r\nepitympanicus, situated above the level of the membrane and containing\r\nthe upper part of the malleus and the greater part of the incus; (3) a\r\nrelatively large ventral recess in the bulla ossea.\r\n\r\nThe =external wall= (Paries membranacea) is formed largely by the thin\r\n=membrana tympani=, which closes the inner end of the external auditory\r\ncanal, and thus forms the septum between the external and middle parts\r\nof the ear. The membrane is an oval disc, which slopes obliquely\r\ndownward and inward at an angle of about 30 degrees with the lower wall\r\nof the external auditory canal. The circumference is attached in a\r\ngroove (Sulcus tympanicus) in the thin ring of bone (Annulus tympanicus)\r\nwhich almost completely surrounds it. The handle of the malleus (the\r\noutermost of the auditory ossicles) is attached to the inner surface of\r\nthe membrane and draws the central part inward, producing a slight\r\nconcavity of the outer surface. The periphery is thickened, forming the\r\nannulus fibrosus. The membrana tympani consists of three layers. The\r\nexternal =cutaneous layer= (Stratum cutaneum) is a prolongation of the\r\nlining of the external auditory meatus. The middle =fibrous layer= or\r\n=membrana propria= includes two chief sets of fibers; the outer stratum\r\n(Stratum radiatum) consists of fibers which radiate from the handle of\r\nthe malleus, while the inner stratum (Stratum circulare) is composed of\r\ncircular fibers which are best developed peripherally. There are also\r\nbranched or dendritic fibers in part of the membrane. The internal\r\n=mucous layer= (Stratum mucosum) is a part of the general mucous\r\nmembrane which lines the tympanic cavity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 565.—RIGHT PETROUS TEMPORAL BONE OF HORSE, ANTERO-INTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, External auditory meatus; _2_, annulus tympanicus; _3_, laminæ;\r\n    radiating from _2_; _4_, membrana tympani; _5_, malleus; _6_, incus;\r\n    _7_, stapes; _8_, fenestra cochleæ (s. rotundum); _9_, facial canal;\r\n    _11_, _11″_, semicircular canals; _11′_, vestibule; _12_, cochlea.\r\n    (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 566.—RIGHT AUDITORY OSSICLES AND MEMBRANA TYMPANI, ENLARGED AND\r\n    VIEWED FROM INNER SIDE AND BELOW.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Malleus; _2_, incus; _2′_, _2″_, short and long processes of _2_;\r\n    _3_, stapes; _4_, tensor tympani; _5_, ligament attaching long\r\n    process of malleus; _6_, stapedius muscle; _7_, fenestra cochleæ (s.\r\n    rotundum).

The =promontory= (Promontorium) is a distinct eminence near\r\nthe center which corresponds to the first coil of the cochlea, and is\r\nmarked by a faint groove for the superficial petrosal nerve. Above this\r\nis the =fenestra vestibuli= (s. ovalis), a reniform opening which is\r\nclosed by the foot-plate of the stapes and its annular ligament. The\r\n=fenestra cochleæ= (s. rotundum) is situated below and behind the\r\npreceding; it is an irregularly oval opening and is closed by a thin\r\nmembrane (Membrana tympani secundaria), which separates the tympanic\r\ncavity from the scala tympani of the cochlea.\r\n\r\nThe =anterior wall= (Paries tubaria) is narrow, and is pierced by the\r\nslit-like tympanic opening of the Eustachian tube. Above this and\r\nincompletely separated from it by a thin plate of bone is the semicanal\r\nfor the tensor tympani muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =superior wall= or =roof= (Paries tegmentalis) is crossed in its\r\ninner part by the facial nerve; here the facial canal is more or less\r\ndeficient ventrally, and the nerve is covered by the mucous membrane of\r\nthe tympanum.\r\n\r\nThe =posterior wall= (Paries mastoidea) presents nothing of importance;\r\na tympanic antrum and mastoid cells, such as are found behind the\r\ntympanic cavity proper in man and many animals, are not present in the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior wall= or =floor= (Paries tympanica) is concave and thin.\r\nIt is crossed by delicate curved ridges, which radiate from the greater\r\npart of the annulus tympanicus.\r\n\r\nThe =auditory ossicles= (Ossicula auditus) form a chain which extends\r\nfrom the outer to the inner wall of the cavity.

The =head= (Capitulum mallei) is\r\nsituated in the epitympanic recess. It is smooth and convex above and in\r\nfront, and presents on its postero-internal aspect a concave facet for\r\narticulation with the body of the incus. The =neck= (Collum mallei) is\r\nthe constricted part below the head; its inner surface is crossed by the\r\nchorda tympani. The =handle= (Manubrium mallei) is directed downward,\r\ninward, and a little forward from the neck, and is attached along its\r\nentire length to the membrana tympani. On its inner surface, near the\r\nupper end, there is a slight projection to which the tendon of the\r\ntensor tympani muscle is attached. The =long process= (Processus longus)\r\nis a pointed spicule which projects forward from the neck toward the\r\npetro-tympanic fissure. The =short process= (Processus brevis) is a\r\nslight projection of the outer side of the neck, and is attached to the\r\nupper part of the membrana tympani.\r\n\r\nThe =incus= or anvil is situated chiefly in the epitympanic recess. It\r\nmay be said to resemble a bicuspid tooth with two divergent roots, and\r\nconsists of a body and two processes. The =body= (Corpus incudis)\r\narticulates with the head of the hammer. The =long process= (Crus\r\nlongum) projects downward from the body and then curves inward; its\r\nextremity has attached to it a small nodule of bone, the os\r\n=lenticulare=, which articulates with the head of the stapes. The =short\r\nprocess= (Crus breve) projects chiefly backward, and is attached to the\r\nwall of the recess by a small ligament.\r\n\r\nThe =stapes= or stirrup consists of a head, two crura, and a base. The\r\n=head= (Capitulum stapedis) is directed outward and articulates with the\r\nos lenticulare. The =crura=, anterior and posterior (Crus anterius,\r\nposterius), are directed inward from the head, and join the ends of the\r\nbase. The =base= or foot-plate (Basis stapedis) occupies the fenestra\r\nvestibuli, to which it is attached. The space between the crura and the\r\nbase is closed by a membrane.\r\n\r\nThe =articulations= and =ligaments= of the auditory ossicles comprise:\r\n(1) A diarthrodial joint between the head of the malleus and the body of\r\nthe incus (Articulatio incudomalleolaris), inclosed by a capsule. (2) An\r\nenarthrosis between the os lenticulare and the head of the stapes\r\n(Articulatio incudostapedia), also surrounded by a capsule. (3) The base\r\nof the stapes is attached to the margin of the fenestra vestibuli by a\r\nring of elastic fibers (Lig. annulare baseos stapedis). (4) Small\r\nligaments attach the head of the malleus and the short crus of the incus\r\nto the roof of the epitympanic recess. (5) The axial ligament (of\r\nHelmholtz) attaches the neck of the malleus to a small projection (Spina\r\ntympanica anterior) above and in front of the annulus tympanicus.\r\n\r\nThe =muscles= of the auditory ossicles are two in number, viz., the\r\ntensor tympani and the stapedius. The =tensor tympani= arises from the\r\nupper wall of the osseous Eustachian tube, and ends in a delicate tendon\r\nwhich bends outward and is inserted into the handle of the malleus near\r\nits upper end. When it contracts, it draws the handle of the malleus\r\ninward and tenses the membrana tympani; it probably also rotates the\r\nmalleus around its long axis. It is innervated by the motor part of the\r\ntrigeminus through the otic ganglion. The =stapedius= arises from a\r\nsmall prominence (Eminentia pyramidalis) of the posterior wall of the\r\ntympanum, runs forward on the facial nerve, and is inserted into the\r\nneck of the stapes. Its action is to draw the head of the stapes\r\nbackward and rotate the anterior end of the base outward, thus tensing\r\nthe annular ligament. It is innervated by the facial nerve.\r\n\r\nThe =tympanic mucous membrane= (Tunica mucosa tympanica) is continuous\r\nwith that of the pharynx and the guttural pouch through the Eustachian\r\ntube. It is thin, closely united with the underlying periosteum, and is\r\nreflected over the ossicles, ligaments, and muscles, the chorda tympani,\r\nand the facial nerve in the open part of the facial canal. It contains\r\nminute lymph nodules and small mucous glands (Glandulæ tympanicæ). The\r\nepithelium is in general columnar ciliated, but over the membrana\r\ntympani, ossicles, and promontory it is flattened.\r\n\r\nThe =artery= of the tympanum is the stylo-mastoid, a small vessel which\r\narises from the posterior auricular branch of the internal maxillary\r\nartery. It enters the tympanum through the stylo-mastoid foramen, and\r\nforms a circle around the tympanic membrane. The =nerves= of the mucous\r\nmembrane come from the tympanic plexus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE\r\n\r\nThe =Eustachian= or =auditory tube= (Tuba auditiva [Eustachii]) extends\r\nfrom the tympanic cavity to the pharynx; it transmits air to the former\r\nand equalizes the pressure on the two surfaces of the membrana tympani.\r\nIt is directed forward, downward, and slightly inward, and is four to\r\nfive inches (ca. 10 to 12 cm.) in length. Its posterior extremity lies\r\nat the inner side of the root of the muscular process of the petrous\r\ntemporal, and communicates with the anterior part of the tympanic cavity\r\nby the small slit-like =tympanic opening= (Ostium tympanicum tubæ\r\nauditivæ). For a distance of about a quarter of an inch (ca. 6 to 7 mm.)\r\nin front of this opening it is a complete tube, with a curved lumen\r\nwhich is little more than a capillary space. Further forward it has the\r\nform of a plate which widens anteriorly and is curved to inclose a\r\nnarrow groove, that opens ventrally into an extensive diverticulum\r\ntermed the guttural pouch. The =pharyngeal opening= (Ostium pharyngeum\r\ntubæ auditivæ) is situated on the postero-superior part of the lateral\r\nwall of the pharynx just below the level of the posterior nares. It is a\r\nslit, an inch or more (ca. 3 cm.) in length, which slopes downward and\r\nbackward. It is bounded internally by the thin free edge of the tube,\r\nfrom the lower part of which a fold of mucous membrane (Plica\r\nsalpingo-pharyngea) extends in the same direction on the lateral wall of\r\nthe pharynx for a distance of a little more than an inch usually. The\r\nouter boundary of the opening is the lateral wall of the pharynx. The\r\nbasis of the tube is a plate of fibro-cartilage (Cartilago tubæ\r\nauditivæ) which is firmly attached dorsally to the fibrous tissue which\r\ncloses the foramen lacerum basis cranii, the temporal wing of the\r\nsphenoid, and the pterygoid bone.[222] On cross-section the cartilage\r\n(except at its tympanic end) is seen to consist of two laminæ which are\r\ncontinuous with each other above. The internal lamina (Lamina medialis)\r\ngradually widens toward the pharyngeal end, where it forms a broad\r\nvalvular flap. This is convex internally, and its thin anterior edge\r\nforms the inner margin of the pharyngeal opening. Behind this the lamina\r\nhas a thick free edge which projects ventrally from the roof of the\r\nguttural pouch. The external lamina (Lamina lateralis) is narrow and\r\nthin, and is related externally to the levator and tensor palati\r\nmuscles, which are in part attached to it; it does not exist at the\r\npharyngeal end of the tube. The mucous membrane of the tube is\r\ncontinuous behind with that of the tympanum and in front with that of\r\nthe pharynx. On either side it is reflected to form a large\r\ndiverticulum, the guttural pouch. It is covered with ciliated\r\nepithelium, and contains mucous glands and lymph nodules.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The pharyngeal opening appears to be closed ordinarily, but the tube\r\n  opens during deglutition. This action is apparently produced by the\r\n  part of the palato-pharyngeus muscle which is attached to the tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE GUTTURAL POUCHES\r\n\r\nThe =guttural pouches=, right and left (Figs. 255, 256, 569), are large\r\nmucous sacs, each of which is a ventral diverticulum of the Eustachian\r\ntube (Diverticulum tubæ auditivæ); they are not present in the\r\ndomesticated animals other than the equidæ. They are situated between\r\nthe base of the cranium and the atlas above and the pharynx below.\r\nMedially they are in apposition in great part, but are to some extent\r\nseparated by the intervening ventral straight muscles of the head. The\r\nanterior end is a small cul-de-sac which lies below the body of the\r\npresphenoid between the Eustachian tube and the median recess of the\r\npharynx. The posterior extremity lies near or below the atlantal\r\nattachment of the longus colli. The pouch is related dorsally to the\r\nbase of the cranium, the atlanto-occipital joint capsule, and the\r\nventral straight muscles. Ventrally it lies on the pharynx and the\r\norigin of the œsophagus. Laterally the relations are numerous and\r\ncomplex. They comprise the pterygoid, levator palati, tensor palati,\r\nstylo-hyoideus, and digastricus muscles; the parotid and submaxillary\r\nglands; the external carotid, internal maxillary, and external maxillary\r\narteries; the internal maxillary and jugular veins; the pharyngeal or\r\nguttural lymph glands; the glosso-pharyngeal, hypoglossal, and superior\r\nlaryngeal nerves. The vagus, accessory, and sympathetic nerves, the\r\nsuperior cervical ganglion, the internal carotid artery, and the\r\ninferior cerebral vein are situated in a fold of the upper wall of the\r\npouch. The pouch is reflected around the anterior border of the great\r\ncornu of the hyoid bone so as to clothe both surfaces of the upper part\r\nof the latter. It thus forms an outer compartment, which extends\r\nbackward external to the great cornu and the occipito-hyoideus muscle;\r\nit is related externally to the parotid gland, the articulation of the\r\njaw, the ascending part of the internal maxillary artery, the\r\nsuperficial temporal artery, and the facial nerve; dorsally it covers\r\nthe mandibular nerve and its chief branches, and is attached to the\r\nstyloid process of the conchal cartilage.\r\n\r\nEach pouch communicates with the pharynx through the pharyngeal orifice\r\nof the Eustachian tube, and is in direct continuity with the mucous\r\nmembrane of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe wall of the pouch is a delicate mucous membrane which is in general\r\nrather loosely attached to the surrounding structures. It is covered\r\nwith ciliated epithelium and is supplied with mucous glands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 569.—CROSS-SECTION OF HEAD OF HORSE.\r\n\r\n  The section passes through the base of the external ear and just\r\n    behind the posterior border of the lower jaw. _1_, Rectus capitis\r\n    anterior minor; _2_, rectus capitis anterior major; _3_, inner walls\r\n    of guttural pouches in apposition; _4_, _4_, arytenoid cartilage,\r\n    upper piece apex; _5_, posterior pillar of soft palate; _6_, false\r\n    vocal cord; _7_, lateral ventricle of larynx; _8_, true vocal cord;\r\n    _9_, vocal muscle; _10_, thyro-hyoideus muscle.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is worthy of note that the pharyngeal orifice of the Eustachian\r\n  tube is at such a level as to provide (in the ordinary position of the\r\n  head) only an overflow outlet for the escape of fluid which may\r\n  accumulate in the pouch. The two pouches are often unequal in size,\r\n  and variations in regard to the distance which they extend backward\r\n  are not uncommon. In one case, a small aged horse, the right pouch\r\n  extended along the œsophagus about five inches (ca. 12 cm.) behind the\r\n  ventral tubercle of the atlas, and the left one a little more than two\r\n  inches (ca. 6 cm.). No pathological changes were apparent, and the\r\n  condition was not recognizable externally. Cases of extreme\r\n  size—so-called tympanites—of the pouches occur, and are apparently\r\n  congenital defects. In a case in a yearling colt, the head of which\r\n  was 24 inches long, the left pouch extended about 12 inches (ca. 30\r\n  cm.) behind the tubercle of the atlas, and had a capacity of six\r\n  quarts. The anterior end formed a cul-de-sac about two inches (ca. 5\r\n  cm.) long between the Eustachian tube and levator palati internally\r\n  and the internal pterygoid muscle externally.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE INTERNAL EAR\r\n\r\nThe =internal ear= or =labyrinth= (Auris interna s. Labyrinthus)\r\nconsists of two parts, viz.: (1) a complex membranous sac, which\r\nsupports the auditory cells and the peripheral ramifications of the\r\nauditory nerve; (2) a series of cavities in the petrous temporal bone,\r\nwhich inclose the membranous part. The first is called the =membranous\r\nlabyrinth=, and contains a fluid, the =endolymph=. The second is the\r\n=osseous labyrinth=. The two are separated by the =perilymphatic space=,\r\nwhich is occupied by a fluid termed the =perilymph=.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE OSSEOUS LABYRINTH\r\n\r\nThe =osseous labyrinth= (Labyrinthus osseus) (Fig. 565) is excavated in\r\nthe petrous temporal bone to the inner side of the tympanic cavity. It\r\nconsists of three divisions: (1) a middle part, the =vestibule=; (2) an\r\nanterior one, the =cochlea=; and (3) a posterior one, the =semicircular\r\ncanals=.\r\n\r\n1. The =vestibule= (Vestibulum) is the central part of the osseous\r\nlabyrinth, and communicates in front with the cochlea, behind with the\r\nsemicircular canals. It is a small, irregularly ovoid cavity, which is\r\nabout 5 to 6 mm. in length. Its outer wall separates it from the\r\ntympanic cavity, and in it is the =fenestra vestibuli=, which is\r\noccupied by the base of the stapes. The inner wall corresponds to the\r\nfundus of the internal auditory meatus. It is crossed by an oblique\r\nridge, the =crista vestibuli=, which separates two recesses. The\r\nanterior and smaller of these is the =recessus sphæricus=, which lodges\r\nthe saccule of the membranous labyrinth. In its lower part there are\r\nabout a dozen minute foramina which transmit filaments of the vestibular\r\nnerve to the saccule. The posterior and larger depression is the\r\n=recessus ellipticus=, which lodges the utricle of the membranous\r\nlabyrinth. The crista vestibuli divides below into two divergent\r\nbranches, which include between them the small =recessus cochlearis=;\r\nthis is perforated by small foramina, through which nerve-bundles reach\r\nthe ductus cochlearis. Similar foramina in the recessus ellipticus and\r\nthe crista vestibuli transmit nerve filaments to the utricle and the\r\nampullæ of the superior and external semicircular ducts. The anterior\r\nwall is pierced by an opening which leads into the scala vestibuli of\r\nthe cochlea. The posterior part of the vestibule presents the four\r\nopenings of the semicircular canals. The inner opening of the\r\n=aquæductus vestibuli= is a small slit behind the lower part of the\r\ncrista vestibuli. The aquæductus passes backward in the petrous temporal\r\nbone, and opens on the inner surface of the latter near the middle of\r\nits posterior border; it contains the ductus endolymphaticus.\r\n\r\n2. The =osseous semicircular canals= (Canales semicirculares ossei),\r\nthree in number, are situated behind and above the vestibule. They are\r\nat right angles to each other, and are designated according to their\r\npositions as superior, posterior, and external. They communicate with\r\nthe vestibule by four openings only, since the inner end of the superior\r\nand the upper end of the posterior canal unite to form a common canal\r\n(Crus commune), and the ampullate ends of the superior and external\r\ncanals have a common orifice. Each canal forms about two-thirds of a\r\ncircle, one end of which is enlarged and termed the =ampulla=. The\r\n=superior canal= (Canalis semicircularis superior) is nearly vertical\r\nand is placed obliquely with regard to a sagittal plane, so that its\r\nouter limb is further forward than the inner one. The antero-external\r\nend is the ampulla and opens into the vestibule with that of the\r\nexternal canal. The opposite non-dilated end joins the adjacent end of\r\nthe posterior canal to form the crus commune, which opens into the\r\nsupero-internal part of the vestibule. The =posterior canal= (Canalis\r\nsemicircularis posterior) is also nearly vertical. Its ampulla is below,\r\nand opens into the vestibule directly, while the non-dilated end joins\r\nthat of the superior canal. The =external canal= (Canalis semicircularis\r\nlateralis) is nearly horizontal. Its ampulla is external and opens into\r\nthe vestibule with that of the superior canal.\r\n\r\n3. The =cochlea= is the anterior part of the bony labyrinth. It has the\r\nform of a short blunt cone, the =base= of which (Basis cochleæ)\r\ncorresponds to the anterior part of the fundus of the internal auditory\r\nmeatus, while the =apex= or =cupola= (Cupula) is directed outward,\r\nforward, and downward. It measures about 7 mm. across the base and about\r\n4 mm. from base to apex. It consists of a =spiral canal= (Canalis\r\nspiralis cochleæ), which forms two and a half turns around a central\r\ncolumn termed the =modiolus=. The modiolus diminishes rapidly in\r\ndiameter from base to apex. Its base (Basis modioli) corresponds to the\r\narea cochleæ of the fundus of the internal auditory meatus, and its apex\r\nextends nearly to the cupola. Projecting from the modiolus like the\r\nthread of a screw is a thin plate of bone, the =lamina spiralis ossea=.\r\nThis begins between the two fenestræ and ends near the cupola as a\r\nhook-like process (Hamulus laminæ spiralis). The lamina extends about\r\nhalf-way to the periphery of the cochlea and partially divides the\r\ncavity into two passages; of these, the upper one is termed the =scala\r\nvestibuli=, and the lower the =scala tympani=. The membrana basilaris\r\nextends from the free margin of the lamina to the outer wall of the\r\ncochlea and completes the septum between the two scalæ, but they\r\ncommunicate through the opening (Helicotrema) at the cupola. The\r\nmodiolus is traversed by an axial canal which transmits the nerves to\r\nthe apical coil, and by a spiral canal (canalis spiralis modioli), which\r\nfollows the attached border of the lamina spiralis, and contains the\r\nspiral ganglion and vein. Close to the beginning of the scala tympani is\r\nthe inner orifice of the =aquæductus cochleæ=, a small canal which opens\r\nbehind the internal auditory meatus, and establishes a communication\r\nbetween the scala tympani and the subarachnoid space.\r\n\r\nThe =internal auditory meatus= has been described in part (_vide_\r\nOsteology). The fundus of the meatus is divided by a ridge (Crista\r\ntransversa) into upper and lower parts. The anterior part of the upper\r\ndepression (Area n. facialis) presents the cranial opening of the facial\r\ncanal; and the posterior part (Area vestibularis superior) is perforated\r\nby foramina for the passage of nerves to the utricle and the ampullæ of\r\nthe superior and external membranous semicircular canals. The anterior\r\npart of the inferior depression (Area cochleæ) presents a central\r\nforamen and a spiral tract of minute foramina (Tractus spiralis\r\nforaminosus) for the passage of nerves to the cochlea. Behind these is\r\nan area of small openings which transmit nerves to the saccule (Area\r\nvestibularis inferior), and a single foramen (F. singulare) for the\r\npassage of a nerve to the ampulla of the posterior semicircular canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE MEMBRANOUS LABYRINTH\r\n\r\nThe =membranous labyrinth= (Labyrinthus membranaceus) lies within, but\r\ndoes not fill, the osseous labyrinth. It is attached to the latter by\r\ndelicate trabeculæ which traverse the perilymphatic space. It conforms\r\nmore or less closely to the bony labyrinth, but consists of four\r\ndivisions, since the vestibule contains two membranous sacs—the utricle\r\nand saccule.\r\n\r\n1. The =utricle= (Utriculus), the larger of the two sacs, lies in the\r\npostero-superior part of the vestibule, largely in the recessus\r\nellipticus. It receives the openings of the membranous semicircular\r\ncanals, and the small =ductus utriculo-saccularis= leads from its lower\r\npart to the ductus endolymphaticus.\r\n\r\n2. The =saccule= (Sacculus) is situated in the recessus sphæricus of the\r\nvestibule. From its lower part the =ductus reuniens= proceeds to open\r\ninto the ductus cochlearis, a little in front of the blind end of the\r\nlatter. A second narrow tube, the =ductus endolymphaticus=, passes from\r\nthe posterior part of the saccule, and is joined by the ductus\r\nutriculo-saccularis; it then traverses the aquæductus vestibuli, and\r\nterminates under the dura mater on the posterior part of the internal\r\nsurface of the petrous temporal bone in a dilated blind end, the saccus\r\nendolymphaticus.\r\n\r\n3. The =membranous semicircular canals= (Ductus semicirculares)\r\ncorrespond in general to the osseous canals already described, but it\r\nmay be noted that while the ampullæ of the membranous canals nearly fill\r\nthose of the osseous canals, the other parts of the membranous canals\r\nonly occupy about one-fourth of the bony cavities.\r\n\r\n4. The =cochlear duct= (Ductus cochlearis) is a spiral tube situated\r\nwithin the cochlea. It begins by a blind end (Cæcum vestibulare) in the\r\ncochlear recess of the vestibule, and ends by a second blind end (Cæcum\r\ncupulare), which is attached to the cupola of the cochlea. The\r\nvestibular part is connected with the saccule by the ductus reuniens.\r\nThe duct is triangular in cross-section, and it is usual to regard it as\r\nhaving three walls. The vestibular wall or roof, which separates the\r\ncochlear duct from the scala vestibuli, is formed by the very delicate\r\n=membrana vestibularis= (of Reissner), which extends obliquely from the\r\nlamina spiralis ossea to the outer wall of the cochlea. The tympanic\r\nwall or floor intervenes between the cochlear duct and the scala\r\ntympani; it is formed by the periosteum of the marginal part of the\r\nlamina spiralis and the =membrana basilaris=, which stretches between\r\nthe free edge of the lamina and the outer wall of the cochlea. The outer\r\nwall consists of the fibrous lining of the cochlea, which is greatly\r\nthickened to form the =ligamentum spirale cochleæ=.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 570.—LEFT MEMBRANOUS LABYRINTH (ENLARGED).\r\n\r\n  _1_, Cochlea; _2_, fenestra vestibuli; _3_, fenestra cochleæ; _4_,\r\n    ductus endolymphaticus; _5_, superior, _6_, external, _7_, inferior\r\n    semicircular canal.

But in certain situations\r\nspecial and remarkable structures occur, among which are the following:\r\n(1) The =maculæ acusticæ= appear as small whitish thickenings of the\r\ninner walls of the saccule and utricle. The epithelium here consists of\r\ntwo kinds of cells, viz., supporting cells and hair cells. The latter\r\nare flask-shaped and are surrounded by the fusiform supporting cells.\r\nThe free end of each hair cell bears a stiff, hair-like process composed\r\nof a bundle of cilia. Fibers of the saccular and utricular branches of\r\nthe vestibular nerve form arborizations about the basal parts of the\r\nhair cells. Adherent to the surface of the maculæ are fine crystals of\r\nlime salts, embedded in a mucoid substance, and termed otoconia. (2) The\r\n=cristæ acusticæ= are linear thickenings of the wall of each ampulla of\r\nthe membranous semicircular canals. Their structure is similar to that\r\nof the maculæ. (3) The =spiral organ of Corti= (Organon spirale) is an\r\nepithelial elevation which is situated upon the inner part of the\r\nmembrana basilaris, and extends the entire length of the ductus\r\ncochlearis. It is very complicated in structure, but consists\r\nessentially of remarkable supporting cells and hair cells. Fibers of the\r\ncochlear nerve ramify about the basal parts of the hair cells.\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =artery= of the internal ear is the internal\r\nauditory artery, a very small vessel which usually arises from the\r\nposterior cerebellar artery, and enters the internal auditory meatus.\r\nThe =veins= go to the inferior petrosal sinus. The =vestibular nerve= is\r\ndistributed to the utricle, saccule, and membranous semicircular canals,\r\nand mediates equilibration. The =cochlear nerve= gives a branch to the\r\nsaccule and enters the central canal of the modiolus. Along its course\r\nit gives off fibers which radiate outward between the two plates of the\r\nlamina spiralis ossea, and ramify about the hair cells of the organ of\r\nCorti. The =ganglion spirale= or ganglion of Corti is situated in the\r\nspiral canal of the modiolus near the fixed border of the lamina\r\nspiralis. The cochlear nerve mediates the sense of hearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE SKIN\r\n\r\nThe =skin= or =common integument= (Integumentum commune) is the\r\nprotective covering of the body, and is continuous at the natural\r\nopenings with the mucous membranes of the digestive, respiratory, and\r\nurogenital tracts. It contains peripheral ramifications of the sensory\r\nnerves, and is thus an important sense organ. It is the principal factor\r\nin the regulation of the temperature of the body, and by means of its\r\nglands it plays an important part in secretion and excretion. Some of\r\nits special horny modifications or appendages are used as organs of\r\nprehension or as weapons.\r\n\r\nThe =thickness= of the skin varies in the different species, on\r\ndifferent parts of the body of the same animal, and also with the breed,\r\nsex, and age. The color also varies greatly, but this is masked in most\r\nplaces by the covering of hair or wool. The skin is in general highly\r\nelastic and resistant.\r\n\r\nPermanent =folds= of the skin (Plicæ cutis) occur in certain situations,\r\nand in some places there are cutaneous =pouches= or =diverticula= (Sinus\r\ncutis).\r\n\r\nThe skin is attached to the underlying parts by the =subcutis= or\r\n=superficial fascia= (Tela subcutanea). This consists of connective\r\ntissue containing elastic fibers and fat. When the fat forms a layer of\r\nconsiderable thickness, it is termed the =panniculus adiposus=. Over a\r\nconsiderable part of the body the subcutis contains striped muscle, the\r\n=panniculus carnosus= (M. cutaneus); in some regions the fibers of the\r\nmuscle are inserted into the skin, and their contraction twitches the\r\nskin or produces temporary folds.[224] The amount of subcutaneous tissue\r\nvaries widely; in some places it is abundant, so that the skin can be\r\nraised considerably; in other situations it is practically absent and\r\nthe skin is closely adherent to the subjacent structures. =Subcutaneous\r\nbursæ= often develop over prominent parts of the skeleton where there is\r\nmuch pressure or friction.\r\n\r\n=Structure.=—The integument consists of the cutis or skin proper and its\r\nepidermal appendages, _e. g._, hairs, hoofs, claws, horns, etc. The\r\ncutis consists of two distinct strata, viz., a superficial epithelial\r\nlayer, the =epidermis=, and a deep connective-tissue layer, the\r\n=corium=.\r\n\r\nThe =epidermis= is a non-vascular, stratified epithelium of varying\r\nthickness. It presents the openings of the cutaneous glands and the\r\nhair-follicles, and its deep surface is adapted to the corium.[225] It\r\nis divisible into a superficial, harder, drier part, the =stratum\r\ncorneum=, and a deeper, softer, moister part, the =stratum\r\ngerminativum=. The cells of the latter contain pigment, and by their\r\nproliferation compensate the loss by desquamation of the superficial\r\npart of the stratum corneum. In many places further subdivision into\r\nstrata is evident on properly prepared cross-sections.\r\n\r\nThe =corium= consists essentially of a feltwork of connective-tissue and\r\nelastic fibers. It is well supplied with vessels and nerves, and\r\ncontains the cutaneous glands, the hair-follicles, and unstriped muscle.\r\nThe deeper part of the corium, the =tunica propria=, consists of a\r\nrelatively loose network of coarse bundles of fibers, and in most places\r\nthere is no clear line of demarcation between it and the subcutis. The\r\nsuperficial part, the =corpus papillare=, is of finer texture and is\r\nfree from fat. Its superficial face is thickly beset with blunt conical\r\nprominences, the =papillæ=, which are received into corresponding\r\ndepressions of the epidermis. They contain vascular loops and nerves,\r\nor, in certain situations, special nerve-endings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The papillæ are best developed where the epidermis is thick and hairs\r\n  are small or absent. On thickly-haired regions they are small or even\r\n  absent. On certain parts of the body (anus, vulva, prepuce, scrotum,\r\n  eyelids, etc.) the corium contains pigment in its connective-tissue\r\n  cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =glands= of the skin (Glandulæ cutis) are chiefly of two kinds,\r\nsudoriferous and sebaceous.\r\n\r\nThe =sudoriferous= or =sweat glands= (Glandulæ sudoriferæ) consist of a\r\ntube, the lower, secretory part of which is coiled in the deep part of\r\nthe corium or in the subcutis to form a round or oval ball (Corpus\r\nglandulæ sudoriferæ). The excretory duct (Ductus sudoriferus) passes\r\nalmost straight up through the corium, but pursues a more or less\r\nflexuous course through the epidermis, and opens into a hair-follicle or\r\nby a funnel-shaped pore (Porus sudoriferus) on the surface of the skin.\r\n\r\nThe =sebaceous glands= (Glandulæ sebaceæ) are in great part associated\r\nwith the hairs, into the follicles of which they open. Their size varies\r\nwidely, and is in general in inverse ratio to that of the hair. The\r\nlarger ones are easily seen with the naked eye, and appear as small,\r\npale yellow or brownish bodies. In certain situations (_e. g._, the\r\nlabia vulvæ, anus, prepuce) they are independent of the hairs and are\r\nwell developed. In form they may be branched alveolar, simple alveolar,\r\nor even tubular in type. They secrete a fatty substance, the =sebum\r\ncutaneum=, which serves as a protective against moisture, and may also\r\n(by its aromatic constituents) play an important part in the sexual life\r\nof animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The two kinds of glands described above are those which are most\r\n  widely distributed, but many special types occur. Some of these are to\r\n  be regarded as modified sweat glands, _e. g._, the naso-labial glands\r\n  of the ox, the glands of the snout of the pig, and the glands of the\r\n  plantar cushion of the horse. Others, _e. g_., the tarsal (or\r\n  Meibomian) glands of the eyelids, are modified sebaceous. Still others\r\n  are not yet classified satisfactorily. Some of these special types\r\n  have been referred to in previous chapters, and others will receive\r\n  attention in the special descriptions which follow. The mammary glands\r\n  are highly modified cutaneous glands, which are intimately associated\r\n  in function with the genital organs, and have been described with the\r\n  latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The =arteries= of the skin enter from the\r\nsubcutis, where they communicate freely. In the deeper part of the\r\ncorium they form a plexus, and another network is formed under the\r\npapillæ. Small vessels from the deep plexus go to the fat and sweat\r\nglands, and the subpapillary plexus sends fine branches to the papillæ,\r\nhair-follicles, and sebaceous glands. The =veins= form two plexuses, one\r\nbeneath the papillæ, and another at the junction of the corium and\r\nsubcutis. The =lymph vessels= form subpapillary and subcutaneous\r\nplexuses.\r\n\r\nThe =nerves= vary widely in number in different parts of the skin. The\r\nterminal fibers either end free in the epidermis and in certain parts of\r\nthe corium, or form special microscopic corpuscles of several kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE APPENDAGES OF THE SKIN\r\n\r\nThe appendages of the skin are modifications of the epidermis, and\r\ncomprise the hairs, hoofs, claws, horns, etc.\r\n\r\nThe =hairs= (Pili) cover almost the entire surface of the body in the\r\ndomesticated mammals, and some parts which appear at first sight to be\r\nbare are found on close inspection to be provided with sparse and very\r\nfine hair. The hairs are constantly being shed and replaced, but at\r\ncertain periods in the horse, for example, they fall out in great\r\nnumbers, constituting the shedding of the coat. It is customary to\r\ndistinguish the ordinary hairs (the coat), which determine the color of\r\nthe animal, from the special varieties found in certain places. Among\r\nthe latter are the long =tactile hairs= about the lips, nostrils, and\r\neyes; the =eyelashes= or =cilia=; the =tragi= of the external ear; and\r\nthe =vibrissæ= of the nostrils. Other special features will be noted in\r\nthe discussion of the skin of the various species. The hairs are\r\ndirected in such a way as to form more or less definite =hair-streams=\r\n(Flumina pilorum), and at certain points these converge to form\r\n=vortices= (Vortices pilorum).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 572.—LATERAL VIEW OF HORSE TO SHOW HAIR-STREAMS AND VORTICES.\r\n    (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe part of the hair above the surface of the skin is the =shaft=\r\n(Scapus pili), while the =root= (Radix pili) is embedded in a depression\r\ntermed the =hair-follicle= (Folliculus pili). A vascular =papilla=\r\n(Papilla pili) projects up in the fundus of the follicle and is capped\r\nby the expanded end of the root, the =bulb= of the hair (Bulbus pili).\r\nThe hair-follicles extend obliquely into the corium to a varying depth;\r\nin the case of the long tactile hairs they reach to the underlying\r\nmuscle. Most of the follicles have attached to them small unstriped\r\nmuscles known as the =arrectores pilorum=; these are attached at an\r\nacute angle to the under side of the deep part of the follicle, and\r\ntheir contraction causes erection of the hair and compression of the\r\nsebaceous glands, one or more of which open into the follicle.\r\n\r\nThe hairs are composed of epidermal cells, and consist from without\r\ninward of three parts. The =cuticle= is composed of horny, scale-like\r\ncells which overlap like slates on a roof. The =cortex= consists of\r\nhorny fusiform cells which are packed close together and contain\r\npigment. The =medulla= is the central core of softer, cubical or\r\npolyhedral cells; it contains some pigment and air-spaces.\r\n\r\nThe hair-follicles, being invaginations of the skin, are composed of a\r\ncentral epidermal part, and a peripheral layer which corresponds in\r\nstructure to the corium. The follicles of the tactile hairs have\r\nremarkably thick walls which contain blood-sinuses between their outer\r\nand inner layers; in ungulates the sinuses are crossed by trabeculæ and\r\nassume the character of cavernous or erectile tissue.\r\n\r\nThe =hoofs=, =claws=, =horns=, and other horny structures consist of\r\nclosely packed epidermal cells which have undergone cornification. In\r\nstructure they might be compared to hairs matted together by intervening\r\nepidermal cells. They cover a specialized corium known as their\r\n=matrix=, from which the stratum germinativum derives its nutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SKIN OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\nThe =thickness= of the skin of the horse varies from 1 to 5 mm. in\r\ndifferent regions, and is greatest at the attachment of the mane and the\r\nventral surface of the tail.\r\n\r\nThe =glands= are numerous and are larger than those of the other\r\ndomesticated animals. The sebaceous glands are specially developed on\r\nthe lips, the prepuce, mammary glands, perineum, and labia of the vulva.\r\nThe sweat glands are yellow or brown in color. They occur in almost all\r\nparts of the skin, but are largest and most numerous on the outer wing\r\nof the nostril, the flank, mammary glands, and free part of the penis.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ordinary and tactile =hairs= certain regions present\r\ncoarse hairs of great length. The mane (Juba) springs from the dorsal\r\nborder of the neck and the adjacent part of the withers; its anterior\r\npart, which covers the forehead to a variable extent, is termed the\r\nforetop (Cirrus capitis). The tail, with the exception of its ventral\r\nsurface, bears very large and long hairs (Cirrus caudæ). The tuft of\r\nlong hairs on the flexion surface of the fetlock (Cirrus pedis) gave\r\nrise to the popular name of this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The development of these special hairs varies widely, and is in\r\n  general much greater in the draft breeds than in others. In Shire and\r\n  Clydesdale horses, for instance, the hair on the volar aspect of the\r\n  metacarpus and metatarsus and fetlock is often so long and abundant as\r\n  to account for the term “feather,” which is commonly applied to it by\r\n  horsemen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE HOOF\r\n\r\nThe =hoof=[226] (Unguis) is the horny covering of the distal end of the\r\ndigit. It is convenient to divide it for description into three parts,\r\ntermed the wall, sole, and frog.\r\n\r\n1. The =wall= is defined as the part of the hoof which is visible when\r\nthe foot is placed on the ground.[227] It covers the front and sides of\r\nthe foot, and is reflected posteriorly at an acute angle to form the\r\n=bars=. The latter (Pars inflexa medialis, lateralis) appear on the\r\nground surface of the hoof as convergent ridges, which subside in front\r\nand are fused with the sole; they are united with each other by the\r\nfrog. For topographic purposes the wall may be divided into an anterior\r\npart or “toe” (Pars ungulæ dorsalis), lateral parts or “quarters” (Pars\r\nungulæ medialis, lateralis), and the angles or “heels” (Pars ungularis\r\nmedialis, laterales). It presents two surfaces and two borders.\r\n\r\nThe outer surface is convex from side to side and slopes obliquely from\r\nedge to edge. In front the angle of inclination on the ground plane is\r\nabout 50° for the fore limb, 55° for the hind limb; on the sides the\r\nangle gradually increases and is 100° at the angles. The curve of the\r\nwall is wider on the external than on the internal side, and the\r\nexternal quarter is more oblique than the internal one. The surface is\r\nsmooth and is crossed by more or less distinct ridges, which are\r\nparallel with the coronary border and indicate variations in the\r\nactivity of the growth of the hoof. It is also marked by fine parallel\r\nstriæ, which extend from border to border in an almost rectilinear\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The =slope= of the wall varies considerably in apparently normal\r\n  hoofs. Lungwitz found by careful measurements of 56 fore and 36 hind\r\n  feet the following average angles:\r\n\r\n                                FORE FOOT HIND FOOT\r\n                    Toe            47.26°     54.1°\r\n                    Inner angle   101.57°    96.50°\r\n                    Outer angle   101.37°     96.1°\r\n\r\n  The wall of the fore foot may even be more upright than that of the\r\n  hind, and may have an angle of 60°. The =length= of the wall at the\r\n  toe, quarters, and heels is in the ratio of about 3 ∶ 2 ∶ 1 in the\r\n  fore foot and about 2 ∶ 1½ ∶ 1 in the hind hoof.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inner surface is concave from side to side, and bears about six\r\nhundred thin =primary laminæ= (Cristæ ungulæ), which extend from the\r\ncoronary groove to the junction of wall and sole. Each bears a hundred\r\nor more =secondary laminæ= on its surfaces, so that the arrangement is\r\npennate on cross-section. These horny laminæ are continued on the inner\r\nsurface of the bars, and alternate with corresponding laminæ of the\r\nmatrix.\r\n\r\nThe =proximal= or =coronary border= (Margo occultus) is thin. Its outer\r\naspect is covered by a layer of soft horn known as the =periople=; this\r\nappears as a ring-like prominence above and gradually fades out below;\r\nat the angle it forms a wide cap or bulb and blends centrally with the\r\nfrog. The inner aspect of the border is excavated to form the =coronary\r\ngroove= (Sulcus coronalis ungulæ), which contains the thick coronary\r\nmatrix. The groove is deepest in front, narrows on the sides, and is\r\nwide and shallow at the heels.[228] It is perforated by innumerable\r\nsmall, funnel-like openings which are occupied by the papillæ of the\r\ncoronary matrix in the natural state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 573.—DIGIT OF HORSE, SHOWING SURFACE RELATIONS OF BONES AND\r\n    JOINTS. THE LATERAL CARTILAGE IS EXPOSED.\r\n\r\n  _a_, First phalanx; _b_, second phalanx; _c_, third phalanx; _d_,\r\n    lateral cartilage; _e_, third sesamoid or navicular bone; _f_,\r\n    pastern joint; _g_, coffin joint; _h′_, cut edge of wall of hoof\r\n    (_h_); _i_, laminar matrix. (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s\r\n    Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =distal= or =ground border= (Margo liber) of the unshod hoof comes\r\nin contact with the ground. Its thickness is greatest in front and\r\ndecreases considerably from before backward on the sides, but there is a\r\nslight increase at the angles. Its inner face is united with the\r\nperiphery of the sole by horn of lighter color and softer texture, which\r\nappears on the ground surface of the hoof as the =white line=.\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the case of horses at liberty the wall is usually worn off to the\r\n  level of the adjacent sole, but if the ground is too soft the wall is\r\n  likely to become unduly long and split or break or undergo\r\n  deformation. On very hard or rough ground, on the other hand, the wear\r\n  may be in excess of the growth. In the case of shod horses it is\r\n  necessary to remove the excess of growth of the wall at each shoeing.\r\n  The =thickness= of the wall at the toe, quarters, and heels is about\r\n  in the ratio of 4 ∶ 3 ∶ 2 for the fore foot and about 3 ∶ 2½ ∶ 2 for\r\n  the hind foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. The =sole= (Solea ungulæ) forms the greater part of the ground\r\nsurface of the hoof. It is somewhat crescentic in outline, and presents\r\ntwo surfaces and two borders.\r\n\r\nThe =superior= or =inner surface= is convex, and slopes with a varying\r\ndegree of obliquity downward to the convex border. It presents numerous\r\nsmall funnel-like openings which contain the papillæ of the sole matrix\r\nin the natural state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 574.—CROSS-SECTION OF FOOT OF HORSE, CUT PARALLEL WITH THE\r\n    CORONARY BORDER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =inferior= or =ground surface= is the converse of the preceding. It\r\nis normally arched—and more strongly in the hind than in the fore\r\nfoot—but the curvature is subject to wide variation; in heavy draft\r\nhorses the sole is commonly less curved than in the lighter breeds and\r\nmay even be flat. The surface is usually rough, since the horn\r\nexfoliates here in irregular flakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 575.—HALF OF HOOF OF HORSE, INTERNAL SURFACE\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =convex border= is joined to the wall by relatively soft horn,\r\npreviously referred to as forming the white line on the ground surface\r\nof the hoof. The angle of junction is rounded internally and presents a\r\nnumber of low ridges and specially large openings for the papillæ of the\r\nmatrix. There is frequently a ridge of larger size at the toe.\r\n\r\nThe =concave border= has the form of a deep angle which is occupied by\r\nthe bars and frog. By its junction with these it forms two pronounced\r\nridges in the interior of the foot. The parts of the sole between the\r\nwall and bars may be termed its angles.\r\n\r\n3. The =frog= (Furca ungulæ) is a wedge-shaped mass which occupies the\r\nangle between the bars and sole, and extends considerably below these on\r\nthe ground surface of the foot. It may be described as having four\r\nsurfaces, a base, and an apex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 576.—INTERNAL SURFACE OF PART OF HOOF OF HORSE. (After Schmaltz,\r\n    Atlas d. Anat. d. Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =superior= or =internal surface= is deeply concave from side to\r\nside. It bears a central ridge, the =spine= or “=frog-stay=” (Spina\r\nfurcæ ungulæ), which is high posteriorly and subsides abruptly in front.\r\nOn either side of this is a deep depression, bounded outwardly by the\r\nrounded ridge formed by the junction of the frog with the bar and sole.\r\nThis surface presents fine striæ and openings for the papillæ of the\r\nfrog matrix.\r\n\r\nThe =inferior= or =ground surface= presents a =central furrow= (Sulcus\r\nintercruralis), which is bounded by two ridges or crura (Crura furcæ\r\nungulæ); these converge and form the apex.\r\n\r\nThe =sides= (Facies medialis et lateralis) are united at the upper part\r\nwith the bars and sole, but are free below and form the central wall of\r\nthe deep =lateral furrows= (Sulci cruroparietales), which are bounded\r\noutwardly by the bars.\r\n\r\nThe =base= is wide and high. It is depressed centrally and prominent at\r\nthe sides, where it unites with the angles of the walls; the junction\r\nhere is covered by the expanded periople and constitutes the bulb of the\r\nhoof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 577.—HOOF OF HORSE, RIGHT FORE FOOT, GROUND SURFACE.\r\n\r\n  _37_, Inner quarter; _38_, outer quarter; _39_, ground border of wall\r\n    (toe); _40_, white line; _41_, sole; _42_, apex of frog; _43_,\r\n    lateral ridge of frog; _44_, central furrow of frog; _45_, lateral\r\n    furrow between frog and bar; _46_, bar.

The cells\r\nare in part arranged to form tubes which are united by intertubular\r\nepithelium, and inclose medullary cells and air-spaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 579.—FRONTAL SECTION OF HOOF OF HORSE, POSTERIOR PART VIEWED FROM\r\n    IN FRONT.\r\n\r\n  _1_, Wall; _2_, sole; _3_, bar; _4_, frog; _5_, median ridge of frog;\r\n    _6_, lateral ridge formed by junction of frog and bar; _7_, laminæ\r\n    of bar; _8_, laminæ of wall; _9_, coronary groove; _10_, periople of\r\n    heel.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =wall= may be regarded as consisting of three layers. The external\r\nlayer consists of the periople and the stratum vitreum. The =periople=\r\nis composed of soft, non-pigmented tubular horn. It is continuous with\r\nthe epidermis above, and extends downward a variable distance. Usually\r\nit forms a distinct band somewhat less than an inch wide, except at the\r\nheels, where it is much wider, and caps the angle of inflection of the\r\nwall proper. The =stratum vitreum= is a thin layer of horny scales which\r\ngives the wall below the periople its smooth, glossy appearance. The\r\n=middle= or =tubular layer= forms the bulk of the wall, and is the\r\ndensest part of the hoof. Its horn tubes run in a straight direction\r\nfrom the coronary to the ground border. In dark hoofs it is pigmented\r\nexcept in its deep part. The internal or laminar layer consists of the\r\n=primary= and =secondary laminæ= and is non-pigmented. The laminæ are\r\nnarrow and thin at their origin at the lower margin of the coronary\r\ngroove, but become wider and thicker below. At the junction of the wall\r\nand sole they are united by interlaminar horn to form the white line.\r\nOnly the central part of the laminæ becomes fully keratinized. They are\r\ncomposed of non-tubular horn in the normal state.\r\n\r\nThe =sole= consists of tubular and intertubular horn. The tubes run\r\nparallel with those of the wall and vary much in size.\r\n\r\nThe =frog= is composed of relatively soft horn, which is much more\r\nelastic than that of the wall or sole, and is not fully keratinized. The\r\nhorn tubes in it are slightly flexuous.\r\n\r\nThe hoof is non-vascular and receives its nutrition from the matrix. It\r\nis also destitute of nerves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE MATRIX OF THE HOOF\r\n\r\nThe =matrix= of the hoof (Matrix ungulæ) is the specially modified and\r\nhighly vascular part of the corium of the common integument which\r\nfurnishes nutrition to the hoof. It is convenient to divide it into five\r\nparts which nourish corresponding parts of the hoof.\r\n\r\n1. The =perioplic matrix= or =ring= (Margo matricis ungulæ) is a band 5\r\nto 6 mm. in width which lies in a groove between the periople and the\r\ncoronary border of the wall. It is continuous above with the corium of\r\nthe skin, and is marked off by a groove from the coronary matrix. At the\r\nheels it widens and blends with the matrix of the frog. It bears very\r\nfine, short papillæ which curve downward and are received in depressions\r\nof the periople, to which it supplies nutrition.\r\n\r\n2. The =coronary matrix= or =cushion= (Corona matricis ungulæ) is the\r\nthick part of the corium which occupies the coronary groove, and\r\nfurnishes nutrition to the bulk of the wall. It diminishes in width and\r\nthickness posteriorly, and along the upper border of the bar it is not\r\nvery clearly defined from the matrix of the frog. The convex superficial\r\nsurface is thickly covered with papillæ 4 to 6 mm. in length, which are\r\nreceived into the funnel-like openings of the coronary groove. At the\r\nheels and along the bars the papillæ are arranged in rows, separated by\r\nfine furrows. The deep surface is attached to the extensor tendon and\r\nthe lateral cartilages by an abundant subcutis which contains many\r\nelastic fibers and a rich venous plexus.\r\n\r\n3. The =laminar matrix= (Latus matricis ungulæ)—also termed the\r\nsensitive laminæ—bears primary and secondary laminæ which are\r\ninterleaved with the horny laminæ of the wall and bars in the natural\r\nstate. It is attached to the wall surface of the third phalanx by a\r\nmodified periosteum (Stratum periosteale) which contains a close-meshed\r\nnetwork of vessels, and to the lower part of the lateral cartilages by a\r\nsubcutis which contains a rich venous plexus. The laminæ are small at\r\ntheir origin above, become wider below, and end in several papillæ 4 to\r\n5 mm. in length. The sensitive laminæ supply nutrition to the horny\r\nlaminæ and to the interlaminar horn of the white line.\r\n\r\n4. The =sole matrix= (Latus volare matricis ungulæ)—also termed the\r\nsensitive sole—corresponds to the horny sole, to which it supplies\r\nnutrition. It is often more or less pigmented and bears long papillæ,\r\nwhich are specially large along the convex border and at the angles.\r\nCentrally it is continuous with the matrix of the frog and bars. The\r\ndeep surface is attached to the sole surface of the third phalanx by a\r\nmodified and highly vascular periosteum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 580.—LATERAL VIEW OF FOOT OF HORSE AFTER REMOVAL OF HOOF AND PART\r\n    OF SKIN.

Pferdes.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n5. The =frog matrix= (Furca matricis ungulæ)—also called the sensitive\r\nfrog—is moulded on the deep surface of the frog and bears small papillæ.\r\nIts deep face is blended with the plantar cushion. The germinal cells of\r\nthe frog derive their nutrition from this part of the matrix.\r\n\r\nThe =digital= or =plantar cushion= (Torus digitalis) is an important\r\npart of the elastic apparatus of the foot. It is a wedge-shaped mass\r\nwhich overlies the frog. It presents for description four surfaces, a\r\nbase, and an apex. The =superior surface= faces upward and forward and\r\nis connected with the distal fibrous sheath of the deep flexor tendon.\r\nThe =inferior surface=, covered by the matrix of the frog, is moulded on\r\nthe upper face of the frog. The =lateral surfaces= are related chiefly\r\nto the lateral cartilages; inferiorly the cushion is closely attached to\r\nthe cartilages, but higher up a rich venous plexus intervenes. The\r\n=base=, situated posteriorly, is partly subcutaneous, and is divided by\r\na central depression into two rounded prominences termed the bulbs of\r\nthe plantar cushion. The =apex= lies under the terminal part of the deep\r\nflexor tendon. The cushion is poorly supplied with vessels. It consists\r\nof a feltwork of fibrous trabeculæ and elastic fibers, in the meshes of\r\nwhich are masses of fat. The bulbs are soft and loose in texture and\r\ncontain a relatively large amount of fat, but toward the apex the\r\ncushion becomes denser and more purely white fibrous in structure.\r\nBranched =coil glands= occur chiefly in the part of the cushion which\r\noverlies the central ridge of the frog. Their ducts pursue a slightly\r\nflexuous course through the matrix and pass in a spiral manner through\r\nthe frog. Their secretion contains fat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 582.—CROSS-SECTION OF DIGIT OF HORSE, THROUGH DISTAL END OF\r\n    SECOND PHALANX.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Second phalanx; _b_, deep flexor tendon; _b′_, digital synovial\r\n    sheath; _c_, plantar cushion; _d_, lateral cartilage; _e_, skin;\r\n    _f_, hoof; _g_, anterior extensor tendon; _h_, cavity of coffin\r\n    joint; _i_, suspensory ligament of navicular bone; _k_, lateral\r\n    ligament of coffin joint; _l_, digital artery; _m_, digital nerve.\r\n    (After Ellenberger, in Leisering’s Atlas.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=Vessels and Nerves.=—The matrix is richly supplied with blood by the\r\n=digital arteries=. The =veins= are valveless, and form remarkable\r\nplexuses which communicate freely with each other and are drained by the\r\ndigital veins. The =lymph vessels= form subpapillary plexuses in the\r\nmatrix of the sole and frog, and a wider-meshed plexus at the base of\r\nthe plantar cushion. A considerable lymph vessel lies in the attached\r\nedge of each of the laminæ. The =nerves= are branches of the digital\r\nnerves; some fibers end in lamellar corpuscles and end-bulbs.\r\n\r\nThe =ergot= is a small mass of horn which is situated in the tuft of\r\nhair at the flexion surface of the fetlock. It is the vestige of the\r\nsecond and fourth digits of extinct equidæ and hence is absent in cases\r\nin which these digits are developed. A small tendinous band, 3 to 5 mm.\r\nin width, extends downward and slightly forward from the fibrous basis\r\nof the ergot on each side, crosses over the digital vessels and nerves\r\nvery obliquely, and blends below with the digital fascia and the plantar\r\ncushion. It is known as the ligament or tendon of the ergot.\r\n\r\nThe term =chestnut= is applied to the masses of horn which occur on the\r\ninner surface of the forearm about a handbreadth above the carpus, and\r\non the lower part of the inner face of the tarsus. They have an\r\nelongated oval form and are flattened. They are regarded usually as\r\nvestiges of the first digit. That of the hind limb is absent in the\r\ndonkey and very small in the mule.\r\n\r\n\r\n  These horny vestiges are quite variable in form and size and are\r\n  correlated with the fineness or coarseness of the integument in\r\n  general. The supracarpal chestnut is about 1½ to 2½ inches long, oval\r\n  in outline, the proximal end being pointed; it overlies the flexor\r\n  carpi internus at a quite variable distance above the carpus, and\r\n  hence should not be used as a surgical landmark. The tarsal chestnut\r\n  lies at a point behind the lower part of the internal lateral ligament\r\n  of the hock. When well developed it is about 2 to 2½ inches long,\r\n  broad below and produced above to form a long pointed end, with a\r\n  short blunt anterior process. They are composed of horn somewhat like\r\n  that of the frog.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ORGAN OF SMELL\r\n\r\nThe peripheral part of the olfactory apparatus or organ of smell\r\n(Organon olfactus) is that part of the nasal mucous membrane which was\r\nreferred to in the description of the nasal cavity as the olfactory\r\nregion; this (Regio olfactoria) is limited to the ethmoturbinals and the\r\nadjacent part of the superior turbinal and the septum nasi, in which the\r\nfibers of the olfactory nerve ramify. It is distinguished by its\r\nyellow-brown color, thickness, and softness. It contains characteristic\r\ntubular =olfactory glands= (of Bowman), which are lined by a single\r\nlayer of pigmented cells, and a neuro-epithelium, the =olfactory cells=,\r\nthe central processes of which extend as non-medullated fibers to the\r\nolfactory bulb.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The epithelium is non-ciliated and is covered by a structureless\r\n  limiting layer. It consists essentially of three kinds of cells,\r\n  supporting, basal, and olfactory. The supporting cells are of long\r\n  columnar form above and contain pigment granules; below they taper and\r\n  often branch, and their central processes unite with those of adjacent\r\n  cells to form a protoplasmic network. The basal cells are branched and\r\n  lie on a basement membrane. The olfactory cells are situated between\r\n  the supporting cells; they have the form of long narrow rods, with an\r\n  enlarged lower part which is occupied by the nucleus. The peripheral\r\n  end pierces the limiting membrane and bears a tuft of fine hair-like\r\n  cilia (olfactory hairs). A central process extends from the nucleated\r\n  pole of the cell to the olfactory bulb as a non-medullated olfactory\r\n  nerve-fiber.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =vomero-nasal organ= (of Jacobson) lies along each side of the\r\nanterior part of the lower border of the septum nasi. It communicates\r\nwith the nasal cavity through the naso-palatine canal. It consists of a\r\ntube of hyaline cartilage lined with mucous membrane; a small part of\r\nthe latter along the inner side is olfactory in character.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE ORGAN OF TASTE\r\n\r\nThe peripheral part of the gustatory apparatus (Organon gustus) is\r\nformed by the microscopic =taste buds= (Calyculi gustatorii), which\r\noccur especially in the foliate, fungiform, and vallate papillæ, in the\r\nfree edge and anterior pillars of the soft palate, and the oral surface\r\nof the epiglottis. The taste buds are ovoid masses, which occupy\r\ncorresponding recesses in the ordinary epithelium; each presents a\r\nminute opening, the gustatory pore. The buds consist of fusiform\r\nsupporting cells grouped around central =gustatory cells=. The latter\r\nare long and narrow; the peripheral end of each bears a small filament,\r\nthe gustatory hair, which projects at the gustatory pore; the central\r\nend is produced to form a fine process which is often branched. The\r\ntaste buds are innervated by fibers of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve and\r\nthe lingual branch of the trigeminus.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SENSE ORGANS AND SKIN OF THE OX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE EYE\r\n\r\nThe =eyelids= are thick, prominent, and less pliable than those of the\r\nhorse. The lower lid bears a considerable number of cilia, which are,\r\nhowever, finer than those of the upper lid. The tarsal glands are more\r\ndeeply embedded and therefore not so evident. The =conjunctiva= of the\r\nlower lid presents folds or ridges, and one or two prominences which\r\ncontain numerous leukocytes; the conjunctival epithelium is transitional\r\nin type. The superficial part of the cartilage of the =third eyelid= is\r\nleaf or shovel-shaped and thicker than in the horse; the edge bears a\r\nnarrower process, on which there is a transverse bar, giving the\r\narrangement some resemblance to an anchor. The =gland= of the third\r\neyelid is very large—an inch or more in length—and may be divided into\r\ntwo parts. The deep part is pink and consists of loose lobules, but the\r\nmuch larger superficial part is more compact. There are two large and\r\nseveral smaller excretory ducts. The subconjunctival tissue of the third\r\neyelid contains lymph nodules, which are specially numerous on the\r\nbulbar side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 583.—EYE OF OX. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =lacrimal gland= is thick and distinctly lobulated. It is more or\r\nless clearly divided into a thick upper and a thinner lower part\r\n(Glandula lacrimalis superior, inferior). There are six to eight larger\r\nexcretory ducts and several smaller ones. The =naso-lacrimal duct= is\r\nshorter than in the horse, and is almost straight. Its terminal part is\r\ninclosed between two plates of cartilage, and it opens near the nostril\r\non the outer wall; the orifice is placed on the inner side of the alar\r\nfold of the inferior turbinal, and is therefore not easily found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 584.—LEFT EYEBALL OF OX _in situ_, EXTERNAL VIEW.\r\n\r\n  _19_, Orbital fat. (After Ellenberger-Baum, Anat. für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =eyeball= resembles that of the horse in shape, but is considerably\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The average transverse diameter is about 42 mm., the vertical diameter\r\n  41 mm., and the axis 36 mm. The angle between the axes is about 119°.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =sclera= is often more or less pigmented; where non-pigmented it may\r\nhave a bluish tinge. The point of entrance of the optic nerve is about 2\r\nmm. external to the vertical meridian, and about 7 mm. below the\r\nhorizontal meridian.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The thickness of the sclera is about 2 mm. at the posterior pole, 1\r\n  mm. at the equator, and 1.2 to 1.5 mm. near the cornea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =cornea= is thicker than that of the horse.\r\n\r\nThe =tapetum= of the chorioidea is extensive at the outer side, but is a\r\nnarrow strip internally. It has a metallic luster, shading from a\r\nbrilliant green to a deep blue; centrally it has a reddish sheen.\r\n\r\nThe =iris= is usually very dark colored. The granula form a continuous\r\nseries of small nodules along the upper margin of the pupil and are most\r\nprominent centrally; they are very small on the lower margin.\r\n\r\nThe =optic papilla= is much smaller and is not so sharply defined on\r\nophthalmoscopic examination as that of the horse. Several relatively\r\nlarge retinal arteries radiate from the center of the papilla to the\r\nperiphery of the retina. They may be seen to wind spirally around the\r\nveins, which are very large.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The arteria centralis retinæ arises from a posterior ciliary artery\r\n  and divides close to the optic papilla into three branches usually; of\r\n  these the upper is larger than the two lateral branches. The retina is\r\n  more vascular than that of the horse; it has a round area centralis at\r\n  the inner side, which is continued outward by a narrow strip of a\r\n  similar histological structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe =vitreous body= is less fluid than that of the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE EAR\r\n\r\nThe =external ear= is inclined outward. The middle part is much wider\r\nand less curved than in the horse. The apex is also wide and does not\r\ncurve forward. The lower part of the anterior border is bent backward\r\nand bears long hairs. The posterior border is thin and is regularly\r\nconvex, except below, where it is indented. The opening is wide and the\r\nconcave surface presents four ridges; the convex surface presents\r\ncorresponding depressions. The styloid process of the conchal cartilage\r\nis short and blunt. The edges of the annular cartilage are in contact at\r\nthe inner side and the upper border is notched externally. The scutiform\r\ncartilage is a very irregular quadrilateral plate; it is situated on the\r\nlateral aspect of the cranium with its concave surface in contact with\r\nthe fat and temporalis muscle. The osseous external auditory meatus is\r\ndirected practically straight inward; it is about twice as long as that\r\nof the horse, and tapers very gradually from without inward. The chief\r\nspecial characters of the =auricular muscles= are as follows: (1) The\r\nscutularis blends with the frontalis muscle. The interscutularis arises\r\nfrom the base of the processus cornu (or the corresponding area in\r\npolled cattle) and from the frontal crest. (2) The cervico-scutularis\r\narises from the posterior surface of the cranium below the frontal\r\neminence, and receives slips from the parieto-auricularis and\r\ncervico-auricularis superficialis. (3) The zygomatico-auricularis and\r\nscutulo-auricularis superficialis inferior are fused. (4) The\r\nscutulo-auricularis superficialis superior is distinct from the\r\ninterscutularis; it arises from the superficial face of the scutiform\r\ncartilage. (5) The cervico-auricularis superficialis arises from the\r\nligamentum nuchæ and ends on the convex surface of the conchal\r\ncartilage. (6) The parieto-auricularis arises from the nuchal surface of\r\nthe frontal bone, the adjacent part of the parietal bone, and the\r\nligamentum nuchæ; it is inserted below the preceding muscle. (7) The\r\nscutulo-auricularis superficialis accessorius arises from the\r\nsuperficial face of the scutiform cartilage and is inserted by a round\r\ntendon into the anterior part of the convex surface of the conchal\r\ncartilage. (8) The cervico-auricularis profundus minor consists of two\r\nfasciculi; the inner, narrow part is deep red in color, and arises from\r\nthe fascia of the cervical muscles external to the occipital attachment\r\nof the ligamentum nuchæ; the outer, wider part is pale, and arises\r\nbeneath the cervico-auricularis superficialis, indirectly from the\r\nscutiform cartilage. The two unite and are inserted into the lower\r\naspect of the base of the conchal cartilage. (9) The scutulo-auricularis\r\nprofundus minor arises from the temporal crest above the external\r\nauditory meatus and is inserted into the anterior part of the deep face\r\nof the scutiform cartilage.\r\n\r\nThe =cavum tympani= is small; it communicates ventrally with the\r\nair-cells of the bulla ossea. The tympanic membrane is nearly circular\r\nand is not so oblique as in the horse. The auditory ossicles are smaller\r\nthan those of the horse; the malleus is more curved, the body of the\r\nincus is longer, and there is a small prominence on the front of the\r\nhead of the stapes for the attachment of the stapedius muscle.\r\n\r\nThe =Eustachian tube= is small and is only about two inches long. The\r\npharyngeal opening is small and is situated on the side of the fornix of\r\nthe pharynx close to the base of the cranium. There is no flap-like\r\nexpansion of the cartilage, but the inner border of the orifice is\r\nformed by a fold of mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nThe =internal ear= has essentially the same arrangement as in the horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           COMMON INTEGUMENT\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the =skin= of the ox is greater than that of any of the\r\nother domesticated animals; in general it is about 3 to 4 mm., but at\r\nthe root of the tail and the point of the hock it is about 5 mm. and on\r\nthe brisket 6 to 7 mm. The variably developed prominence at the anterior\r\npart of the pectoral region known as the brisket consists of a fold of\r\nskin (Plica colli ventralis longitudinalis), which contains posteriorly\r\na mass composed of coarse fibrous trabeculæ and fat.\r\n\r\nThe =cutaneous glands= are fewer and less developed than in the horse.\r\nExcept about the natural openings, at the point of the hock, and the\r\nflexion surface of the fetlock, the =sweat glands= do not form a coil,\r\nbut are enlarged at the deep end and are variably flexuous. The\r\n=sebaceous glands= are best developed about the natural openings and on\r\nthe udder, but there are none on the teats. The =naso-labial glands=\r\nform a thick layer under the bare skin of the muzzle. They are compound\r\ntubular glands and are lined with cubical epithelium. The openings of\r\ntheir excretory ducts are easily seen.\r\n\r\nThe =hairs= are extremely variable in color and size in the different\r\nbreeds and in different individuals. The hair of the frontal region is\r\noften curly, especially in the bull. There is no mane, and the long\r\nhairs of the tail occur only at the end, where they form the “brush”\r\n(Cirrus caudæ).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 585.—CLAWS OF OX, VOLAR ASPECT. (After Ellenberger-Baum. Anat.\r\n    für Künstler.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe =claws=, four in number on each limb, cover the ends of the digits.\r\nThose of the chief digits conform in a general way to the shape of the\r\nthird phalanges, and each may be regarded as having three surfaces. The\r\nabaxial or outer surface is convex from side to side, and is marked by\r\nridges parallel with the coronary border. Its anterior part is concave\r\nfrom edge to edge, and the angle which it forms with the ground is about\r\n30°. The interdigital or inner surface is concave and grooved; it\r\ntouches the opposite claw only at its ends. The inferior or ground\r\nsurface consists of two parts, viz., a slightly concave sole, which is\r\npointed in front and widens behind, and a prominent bulb of soft thin\r\nhorn, which is continuous above with the skin. The claw may be regarded\r\nas consisting of three parts—periople, wall, and sole. The periople\r\nsurrounds the coronary border in the form of a flat band, which is about\r\nhalf an inch wide, except at the heels, where it widens to cover the\r\nentire surface. The wall forms most of the abaxial or outer part of the\r\nclaw and is reflected in front upon the interdigital surface. It thins\r\nout toward the bulb or heel, which appears, as stated above, to consist\r\nof the thin expansion of the periople. The sole occupies the angle of\r\ninflection of the wall; it is continuous without demarcation with the\r\nperiople of the bulb. The perioplic matrix bears relatively long\r\npapillæ. The coronary matrix is much less developed than in the horse\r\nand its papillæ are short. The sensitive laminæ are much narrower and\r\nare more numerous than in the horse; secondary laminæ are not present.\r\nThe matrix of the sole is not marked off behind from that of the\r\nperiople; its papillæ are very small and close together. The matrix of\r\nthe bulbs is separated from the flexor tendon by a mass of elastic,\r\nfatty tissue, which is analogous with the plantar cushion of the horse.\r\nThe papillæ here are long and often compound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 586.—SAGITTAL SECTION OF DISTAL PART OF FORE LIMB OF OX.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe accessory digits bear short conical horn capsules which resemble in\r\na general way those of the chief digits, and have a similar matrix,\r\nwhich covers one or two nodular vestigial phalanges. From these a\r\nfibrous band descends obliquely on the volar aspect of each chief digit\r\nand is attached below to the distal phalanx and sesamoid bones, sending\r\nfibers also to the elastic pad of the heel.\r\n\r\nThe =horns= (Cornua) inclose the horn processes of the frontal bones\r\n(except in the polled breeds). They vary very greatly in size, form, and\r\ncurvature. The root or base of the horn (Radix cornus) has a thin edge\r\nwhich is continuous with the epidermis. It is covered by a thin layer of\r\nsoft horn similar to the periople of the hoof of the horse. Near the\r\nroot the horn is encircled by variable rings. Toward the apex (Apex\r\ncornus) the thickness of the horn increases till it becomes practically\r\na solid mass. The horn consists mainly of tubes which are very close\r\ntogether, except at the rings, where there is more intertubular horn.\r\nThe =matrix= of the horn (Matrix cornus) is united to the horn process\r\nby periosteum which is traversed by numerous blood-vessels. The matrix\r\nat the root of the horn is thick and bears long, slender papillæ; in the\r\nbody of the horn it becomes thin and the papillæ are smaller, but\r\nincrease in size apically. Rudimentary papillated laminæ also occur.\r\n\r\nThe =skin= of the =sheep= varies in thickness from 0.5 to 3 mm., but\r\ndiffers greatly in fineness and in other respects in various breeds. In\r\nMerinos considerable folds occur on the neck. Cutaneous pouches (Sinus\r\ncutis) are constantly present in certain situations. The =infraorbital=\r\nor =lacrimal pouch= (Sinus cutaneus infraorbitalis) is an invagination\r\nabout half an inch in depth, which is situated in front of the inner\r\nangle of the eye. It bears scattered fine hairs, into the follicles of\r\nwhich large compound sebaceous glands open; coil glands are also\r\npresent. The secretion of the glands is fatty and forms a yellow sticky\r\ncovering on the skin when dry. The =inguinal= (or mammary) =pouch=\r\n(Sinus cutaneus inguinalis) is much more extensive, and is situated in\r\nthe inguinal region in both sexes. The skin of the pouch bears scattered\r\nfine hairs and contains well-developed sebaceous glands and exceedingly\r\nlarge coil glands. The =interdigital pouch= (Sinus cutaneus\r\ninterdigitalis) is a peculiar tubular invagination of the integument\r\nwhich opens at the anterior part of the interdigital cleft. On sagittal\r\nsection it appears as a bent tube, an inch or more (ca. 2.5 to 3 cm.) in\r\nlength, and about a fourth of an inch (ca. 6 to 7 mm.) in diameter. The\r\npouch extends downward and backward, and then curves sharply upward\r\nbetween the distal ends of the proximal phalanges. Its deep blind end is\r\nsomewhat ampullate. The subcutis forms a capsule around it. The skin of\r\nthe pouch is thin and pale; it bears fine colorless hairs, the follicles\r\nof which receive the secretion of several sebaceous glands. The coil\r\nglands here are compound and very large; they open into the\r\nhair-follicles or directly into the pouch. The secretion of the glands\r\nis a colorless fatty substance. The skin is covered in great part by\r\nwool, which is similar in structure to hair, but is finer, curly, and\r\nusually contains no medullary cells. The follicles of the wool are\r\ncurved, and are arranged more or less distinctly in groups of ten or a\r\ndozen, several of which open in common on the surface. A considerable\r\npart of the face and the limbs is covered with short, stiff hair, and\r\nlong hairs occur more or less interspersed among the wool. The claws\r\nresemble those of the ox. The horns, when present, are more or less\r\nprismatic, distinctly ringed, and vary in length and curvature in\r\ndifferent breeds. Their structure is similar to those of the ox.\r\n\r\nThe olfactory and gustatory organs resemble in general those of the\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SENSE ORGANS AND INTEGUMENT OF THE PIG\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE EYE\r\n\r\nThe posterior part of the orbital margin is formed chiefly by the\r\norbital ligament, which extends from the extremely short supraorbital\r\nprocess to the small eminence at the junction of the malar and the\r\nzygomatic process of the temporal.\r\n\r\nCilia occur only on the upper eyelid. The inner canthus is prolonged by\r\na groove on the infraorbital region. The tarsal glands are very short\r\nand curved. The conjunctival epithelium is of the transitional type with\r\nmany goblet cells.\r\n\r\nThe deep part of the cartilage of the third eyelid is broad and\r\nspoon-like, the superficial part somewhat anchor-shaped. In addition to\r\nthe gland which surrounds the deep part of the cartilage, there is a\r\ndeeper gland of Harder (Glandula palpebræ tertiæ profunda), which is\r\nsurrounded by a distinct capsule and a blood-sinus. This gland is\r\nbrownish or yellowish-gray in color, elliptical in outline, and about an\r\ninch (2 to 3 cm.) in length. It is situated deeply below the attachment\r\nof the inferior oblique muscle.\r\n\r\nThe caruncula lacrimalis has the form of a ridge; it divides into two\r\nbranches which join the skin at the inner commissure. It is red in color\r\nand contains numerous large coil glands.\r\n\r\nThe lacrimal gland is mucous in type. There is no lacrimal sac, and the\r\ntwo lacrimal ducts pass through separate openings at the infraorbital\r\nmargin. The naso-lacrimal duct is usually short and opens into the\r\ninferior meatus at the posterior end of the inferior turbinal.[229]\r\n\r\nThe eyeball appears small, partly on account of the narrowness of the\r\npalpebral opening; it closely approaches the spherical form. The cornea,\r\nalthough in reality almost circular, appears oval when viewed from the\r\nfront, the inner end being much the broader. The chorioid has no\r\ntapetum. The iris is usually dark grayish-brown or yellowish-brown, but\r\nsometimes has a blue tinge. The pupil is a transverse oval in ordinary\r\nlight, but almost circular when dilated; granula are not present. The\r\noptic papilla is nearer the posterior pole than in the horse and ox, and\r\nhas a distinct central artery and vein.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE EAR\r\n\r\nThe external ear differs considerably in size, thickness, and position.\r\nIt may be carried vertically, inclined inward, or hang downward. It is\r\nrelatively wide and is little curved except at the base. The concave\r\nsurface presents several cutaneous ridges which correspond approximately\r\nwith the long axis of the ear. The anterior border of the concha is\r\nstrongly recurved in its lower part, and divides into two branches, one\r\nof which passes almost horizontally backward in the cavum conchæ, while\r\nthe other continues the general direction of the border. The posterior\r\nborder is slightly concave above, strongly convex below, forming a\r\nprominence somewhat analogous to the lobule of the human ear. The\r\nosseous external auditory meatus is very long and is directed downward\r\nand inward. The tympanic membrane is almost circular.\r\n\r\nThe tympanic cavity proper is small, but it is continuous with the\r\nnumerous cells of the large bulla ossea. The Eustachian tube is short;\r\nits pharyngeal opening is situated in the upper part of the wall of the\r\npharynx immediately behind the posterior nares. It is somewhat\r\ninfundibular, and is bounded internally by a thick fold of mucous\r\nmembrane (Torus tubarius).\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SKIN AND APPENDAGES\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the skin in improved breeds is 1 to 2 mm. Fat usually\r\naccumulates in the subcutis and forms a distinct and often extremely\r\nthick panniculus adiposus over the greater part of the body.\r\n\r\nThe sebaceous glands are in general small and much fewer than in the\r\nother animals. The sweat glands, on the other hand, are large, yellow or\r\nbrownish in color, and are in many places visible to the naked eye. At\r\nthe inner side of the carpus there are small cutaneous diverticula, the\r\nso-called carpal glands, into which numerous compound coil glands open.\r\nLarge glands also occur in the skin of the digits and interdigital\r\nspace. Compound tubular glands are present in the skin of the snout.\r\nLarge sebaceous and sweat glands are found at the entrance to the\r\npreputial diverticulum.\r\n\r\nThe hairs are sparsely scattered in improved breeds—indeed, in some\r\ncases the skin is almost bare. The long hairs or bristles are arranged\r\nusually in groups of three. They are most developed on the neck and\r\nback. The bristles about the snout and the chin are sinus hairs.\r\n\r\nThe =claws= and their matrix resemble those of the ox, but the bulbs are\r\nmore prominent and form a greater part of the ground surface; they are\r\nalso better defined from the sole, which is small. The claws of the\r\naccessory digits are more developed and their parts better\r\ndifferentiated than those of the ox.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe olfactory region is extensive in correlation with the large size of\r\nthe olfactory bulbs; the mucous membrane here is brown in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SENSE ORGANS AND INTEGUMENT OF THE DOG\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE EYE\r\n\r\nThe posterior margin of the orbit is formed by the orbital ligament, as\r\nin the pig. The orbital axes if produced backward would include an angle\r\nof about 79°, the optic axes an angle of about 92.5° (Koschel).\r\n\r\nThe lower eyelid has no distinct cilia. The inner angle is wide, the\r\nlacus lacrimalis shallow, and the caruncula lacrimalis small and\r\nyellowish-brown. The conjunctival epithelium is cylindrical, with many\r\ngoblet cells. The gland which surrounds the deep end of the cartilage of\r\nthe third eyelid is large and pink; it is a mixed gland.\r\n\r\nThe lacrimal gland is flat and lies chiefly under the orbital ligament.\r\nIt is pink in color and mixed in structure. The naso-lacrimal duct is\r\nvariable in arrangement and may differ on the two sides. It may open\r\ninto the inferior meatus immediately after its emergence from the\r\nosseous lacrimal canal; thence it continues forward and opens on the\r\nlateral wall of the nostril below the inferior turbinal fold.\r\n\r\nThe eyeball is almost spherical and is relatively large, especially in\r\nthe small breeds. The sclera is thick in the ciliary region, where it\r\ncontains a well-developed venous plexus; in the vicinity of the equator\r\nit is thin, and the chorioid shows through it. The cornea is almost\r\ncircular. The chorioid is richly pigmented, and presents a well defined\r\n=tapetum cellulosum=; this is somewhat triangular in outline and has a\r\nmetallic luster. Its color is often golden green, shading to blue\r\nperipherally, but the blue tone may predominate, and in other cases it\r\nis mainly golden yellow or reddish-yellow. The appearance is due to\r\nseveral layers of peculiar flattened polygonal cells. The ciliary muscle\r\nis more developed than in the other species. The iris is commonly light\r\nor yellow brown, but not rarely has a blue tinge; the color often\r\ndiffers in the two eyes. The pupil is round; its edge is either smooth\r\nor bears minute round prominences. The retina presents a round area\r\ncentralis external to the optic papilla. The latter is variable in\r\noutline; commonly it has the form of a triangle with the angles rounded\r\noff, but is often round or oval. Branches of the central vessels of the\r\nretina radiate from the middle of the papilla. The surfaces of the lens\r\nare not so strongly curved as in the other domestic animals, and there\r\nis little difference in the radius of curvature of the two surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE EAR\r\n\r\nThe external ear differs greatly in size and form in the various breeds;\r\nin most it is relatively wide and thin and the greater part of it hangs\r\ndown over the opening. The anterior border has a prominence (Spina\r\nhelicis) at its lower part, and below this it divides into two branches\r\n(Crura helicis). One of these continues down to a blunt point, while the\r\nother turns in to the cavity of the concha. The posterior border forms a\r\npouch below its middle, and is thick and rounded in its basal part. Here\r\nthe conchal cartilage bears a pointed process (Processus uncinatus),\r\nwhich projects upward and backward. The outer wall of the cavum conchæ\r\nis supported by a quadrilateral plate (Tragus) above and a semiannular\r\ncartilage below. The concave surface presents several cutaneous folds,\r\nand in the cavum conchæ there are ridges and irregular prominences.\r\nThere are long hairs on the borders, apex, and the folds of the concave\r\nsurface, but the skin of the cavum conchæ is bare. The annular cartilage\r\nis a complete ring. The osseous external auditory meatus is wide and\r\nextremely short.\r\n\r\nThe auricular muscles are thin. The scutularis is extensive and is\r\ndivisible into interscutularis and fronto-scutularis. It partly covers\r\nthe occipitalis muscle, which is oval and unpaired and ends in the\r\nfascia of the frontal region. The scutulo-auriculares superficiales,\r\ninferior et accessorius, and the cervico-scutularis are not\r\ndifferentiated as separate muscles. The cervico-auricularis\r\nsuperficialis and the parieto-auricularis both bifurcate and are\r\ninserted into the base of the concha and the scutiform cartilage. The\r\nparotido-auricularis is narrow and almost long enough to meet the\r\nopposite muscle. The tragicus consists of two parts; of these the\r\nlateral one is long and arises from the border of the mandible above the\r\nangular process. The helicis and the verticalis auriculæ are well\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe tympanic cavity is very roomy, extending ventrally into the large\r\nbut simple cavity of the bulla ossea. The tympanic membrane is extensive\r\nand oval. The promontory is very pronounced. The auditory ossicles are\r\nlarge. The Eustachian tube is short, and has a fibrous outer wall. Its\r\npharyngeal opening is an oblique slit situated on the lateral wall of\r\nthe naso-pharyngeal meatus, and is margined internally by a thick mucous\r\nfold.\r\n\r\nThe cochlea has three and a half turns and is more sharply pointed than\r\nin the ungulates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SKIN AND APPENDAGES\r\n\r\nThe skin varies greatly in thickness in different breeds. It is\r\nremarkably loose on the dorsal aspect of the neck and trunk, where it\r\ncan be raised in extensive folds. The coat is also subject to extreme\r\nvariation in length, thickness, color, etc. The hairs are arranged in\r\ngroups of three to a large extent. The sebaceous glands are best\r\ndeveloped in the short and rough haired breeds. They are largest and\r\nmost numerous at the lips, anus, dorsal surface of the trunk, and\r\nsternal region. The sweat glands are relatively better developed in the\r\nlong and fine haired breeds. The largest are found in the digital pads.\r\nCoil glands occur in the skin of the muzzle, the perineum, and the\r\nparanal pouches.\r\n\r\nOn the flexion surface of the carpus and digit there are hairless,\r\ncushion-like pads. The carpal pad (Torus carpalis) is situated medial\r\nand distal to the accessory carpal bone. The metacarpal and metatarsal\r\npads (Torus metacarpalis, metatarsalis) are the largest and are situated\r\nbehind the distal ends of the metacarpal or metatarsal bones and the\r\ngreater part of the first phalanges. They are somewhat heart-shaped,\r\nwith two unequal lateral lobes, and the apex distal. The\r\nmetapodiophalangeal joints rest on them when the paw supports the\r\nweight. The digital pads (Tori digitales) are oval and are much smaller;\r\nthey similarly support the second digital joints. That of the first\r\ndigit is small on the fore limb, and usually absent from the hind limb.\r\nEach receives two suspensory bands from the tubercles at the distal end\r\nof the corresponding second phalanx. The pads have a basis of\r\nfibro-elastic tissue and fat, which is intimately adherent to the skin\r\nand is connected by trabeculæ with the bones and tendons. The epidermis\r\nis thick and largely keratinized, and is studded with numerous rounded\r\npapillæ which are readily seen with the naked eye. The corium has large\r\npapillæ, and contains sweat glands and lamellar corpuscles.\r\n\r\nThe =claws= (Ungues) correspond in form to the ungual part of the distal\r\nphalanges which they inclose. The horn of the claw consists of a body or\r\nwall and a sole. The former is strongly curved in both directions, and\r\nis compressed laterally. Its root or coronary border fits into the\r\ndepression under the bony collar or ungual crest of the third phalanx\r\nand is covered by skin. The lateral borders converge and inclose the\r\nsole anteriorly. The matrix presents a coronary part which bears papillæ\r\nonly near the coronary border. On the dorsal surface it is thickened to\r\nform a ridge, and the corresponding part of the horny covering is thick\r\nand maintains the pointed character of the claw. The matrix of the sides\r\nof the wall bears small laminæ which converge to the matrix of the sole.\r\nThe latter is papillated. When the flexor muscles are inactive, the\r\ndistal phalanges and the claws are maintained in dorsal flexion by two\r\nelastic ligaments. These arise from the tubercles at the proximal end of\r\nthe second phalanx and converge to the dorsal aspect of the ungual crest\r\nof the third phalanx.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 587.—PADS OF PAW OF DOG.\r\n\r\n  _a_, Carpal pad; _b_, metacarpal pad; _c^1-c^5_, digital pads.

The mucous membrane is distinguished\r\nby its thickness and yellow color, and is very extensive. It covers\r\nabout half of the large ethmoturbinals, and one-third to one-half of the\r\nseptum nasi. The ethmoturbinal which projects into the frontal sinus and\r\nthe adjacent inner wall of the sinus is olfactory in character.\r\nOlfactory nerve-fibers ramify in the vomero-nasal organ (of Jacobson).\r\n\r\nThe gustatory apparatus presents no special features of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Abdomen, muscles of, 245\r\n   of dog,

For the microscopic\r\n  structure reference is to be made to histological works.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  Only a brief general statement of osteogenesis can be made here;\r\n  details must be sought in embryological literature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  As might be expected from the history of anatomy, a good many of these\r\n  terms are more or less interchangeable; furthermore, a given skeletal\r\n  feature may differ greatly in various species.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The term is employed here, as is usual in descriptive anatomy, to\r\n  designate only the bony part of the rib (Os costale); morphologically\r\n  it includes the cartilaginous part also.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  The manubrium sterni of man is equivalent, strictly speaking, to the\r\n  cariniform cartilage + the first osseous segment of the horse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  The long axis of the skull is considered to be horizontal in these\r\n  descriptions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  The occipital crest of this description is equivalent to the external\r\n  occipital protuberance and superior nuchal line of man. A curved line\r\n  a little lower down, which is continued on the paramastoid process,\r\n  represents the inferior nuchal line of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Other terms for these parts are basioccipital (basilar part),\r\n  exoccipitals (lateral parts), and supraoccipital (squamous part). It\r\n  should be noted, however, that the lines between the basioccipital and\r\n  exoccipitals pass through the lower part of the condyles.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  This foramen might well be called a canal, since it is an inch or more\r\n  in length.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  The cavity so formed may be termed the sphenopalatine sinus. The\r\n  sphenoidal sinus may be a separate cavity which communicates only with\r\n  the ventral ethmoidal meatuses; this arrangement exists in about a\r\n  third of the cases, according to Paulli.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  This is also called the subsphenoidal canal or pterygoid foramen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  On account of its deep situation, and the fact that it cannot be\r\n  separated from its surroundings, the ethmoid must be studied by means\r\n  of appropriate sagittal and transverse sections of the skull.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  According to Martin, there are originally four centers, two anterior\r\n  and two posterior (smaller) ones, which fuse in a variable manner.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  This is commonly termed the styloid process. It is not the homologue\r\n  of the styloid process of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  This foramen is somewhat variable in position, but is commonly\r\n  opposite the corner incisor. Smaller inconstant foramina are often\r\n  present.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  The alveolus for the temporary canine is commonly formed in the\r\n  maxilla alone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  This bone is really a greatly developed first ethmoturbinal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  In the Stuttgart Nomenclator Anatomicus (S. N. A.) the body (Corpus)\r\n  is the part which bears the teeth, and is divided into a pars incisiva\r\n  and a pars molaris. The ramus is the rest of the bone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  These correspond to the great cornua of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  This relation varies with age; in the young horse the third tooth, in\r\n  the old subject the fourth, lies below the end of the crest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  This bone is probably equivalent to the fourth and fifth carpals of\r\n  forms in which five carpal elements are present in the lower row.\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  It is also called the large pastern bone or os suffraginis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  This bone is also called the small pastern bone or os coronæ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  This bone is also called the os pedis or coffin bone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  The upper and lower divisions of the wing are sometimes termed the\r\n  basilar and retrossal processes respectively.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  This is termed the lacrimal sinus by some authors. It is similar in\r\n  location and in the position of its orifice to the turbinal part of\r\n  the frontal sinus of the horse, with the important difference that it\r\n  does not communicate with the frontal sinuses in the ox.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  This third bone was termed the phacoid in the cat by Strauss-Durckeim,\r\n  and is regarded by some authors as the vestige of an additional digit,\r\n  the prepollex.\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  It is doubtful whether the synovia is a true secretion or a transudate\r\n  containing products of friction. The view given above is that which is\r\n  more commonly accepted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  This classification makes no claims to scientific accuracy, but is\r\n  simply a statement of the terms in general use. A grouping based on\r\n  mechanical principles seems desirable, but appears to be almost\r\n  impossible on account of the great variety and irregularity of form of\r\n  the articular surfaces.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  The movements in some of these joints are more extensive and varied\r\n  than in some diarthroses. To illustrate this we may compare the\r\n  movements of the cervical or coccygeal vertebræ with those possible in\r\n  the carpo-metacarpal or the sacro-iliac joints.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  In dissecting-room subjects these bursæ and the adjacent structures\r\n  are commonly the seat of pathological changes. They appear to be the\r\n  starting-point of “poll evil” and “fistulous withers.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  No natural line of demarcation exists between the ligamentum nuchæ and\r\n  the lumbo-dorsal continuation of the supraspinous ligament, since the\r\n  change from the purely elastic to the white fibrous structure is\r\n  gradual.\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  The term is a very unfortunate one, since it is a distinct\r\n  misapplication of the name as it is used in regard to man. It is,\r\n  however, very firmly established, and appears likely to persist\r\n  indefinitely in the absence of a convenient popular equivalent.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  This is often called the Y-shaped ligament—a rather\r\n  undesirable name, since it is not bifurcate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  It is also called the V-shaped ligament.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  This should be noted in regard to resection of the lateral cartilage\r\n  or other operations in this vicinity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  These are termed the postero-lateral ligaments by M’Fadyean. They may\r\n  well be called, as by German authors, the suspensory ligaments of the\r\n  navicular bone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  In this figure the patella is pushed up above the trochlea—a position\r\n  which it does not occupy normally.\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  This section consists necessarily only of a brief statement of the\r\n  most important differences in the joints of the other animals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  These movements are best seen in man, in whom the back of the hand may\r\n  be turned forward (pronation) or backward (supination).\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  The student will note in dissection that transition forms occur; also\r\n  that the same sheath may belong to two or more tendons in common, _e.\r\n  g._, the sheath of the two flexors on the back of the carpus. In such\r\n  cases the synovial membrane is reflected from one tendon to the other,\r\n  and may form a secondary mesotendon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  This muscle is probably the homologue of the sternal portion of the\r\n  sterno-cleido-mastoid of man. On account of the differences in its\r\n  insertion in the various animals, it seems desirable to adopt the name\r\n  sterno-cephalicus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  The upper part of this maybe separated from the scalenus proper, and\r\n  is then termed the cervicalis ascendens or ilio-costalis cervicis—a\r\n  continuation in the neck of the transversalis costarum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  This seems due to pressure produced by pathological changes in the\r\n  supra-atloid bursa, which are frequently extensive in dissecting-room\r\n  subjects.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  The lumbar part of this muscle is subject to variation. It may, in\r\n  quite exceptional cases, extend as far as the ilium.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  The muscle as here described includes the spinalis and semispinalis\r\n  components, as the separation of these is largely artificial in the\r\n  horse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  The function of the intercostal muscles is still a subject of much\r\n  discussion. The statements made above seem to represent the view most\r\n  commonly held in regard to their action.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  It should be noted, however, that in the embryo the diaphragm appears\r\n  as a paired structure, extending from the lateral walls of the cœlom\r\n  to fuse with the septum transversum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  In order to get a clear idea of the relative positions of these\r\n  foramina and of the form of the diaphragm, the thoracic surface of the\r\n  latter should be examined while the abdominal viscera remain _in\r\n  situ_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  It is narrow and slit-like in the natural condition, but may appear\r\n  oval in the dissecting-room, especially if the hind limb is drawn back\r\n  and abducted.\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  It must be admitted that the term “ring” is rather misleading as\r\n  applied to the abdominal opening of the canal, since normally it is a\r\n  mere dilatable slit. The ring-like constriction which exists here in\r\n  the male is constituted by the peritoneum, which descends into the\r\n  canal to form the tunica vaginalis. This peritoneal ring is termed the\r\n  =vaginal ring= (Annulus vaginalis), and must not be confused with the\r\n  subperitoneal ring, _i. e._, the internal inguinal ring.\r\n\r\nFootnote 52:\r\n\r\n  As might be expected, the cremaster usually undergoes more or less\r\n  atrophy, and is paler in the castrated subject. In the mare the muscle\r\n  is small, and ends in the connective tissue in the lower part of the\r\n  inguinal canal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  The term canal is somewhat misleading; it is rather a slit-like\r\n  passage or space between the two oblique muscles, since the inguinal\r\n  ligament is that part of the aponeurosis of the external oblique\r\n  muscle which stretches between the external angle of the ilium and the\r\n  prepubic tendon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  The obliquity of the tendon and the angle which it forms with the\r\n  pelvic floor are of clinical importance in regard to manipulation of\r\n  the fœtus in obstetrical cases. The slope varies in different\r\n  subjects. In some cases the tendon forms about a right angle with the\r\n  pubic bones.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  The terms dorsal and ventral are here used in the topographic and not\r\n  in the morphological sense. All the muscles of the group are ventral\r\n  in the latter sense.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  This is regarded as a vestige of the clavicle. On this basis the\r\n  portion of the muscle from the vestige to the arm represents the\r\n  clavicular part of the deltoid of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  Günther states that this muscle assists in extension or flexion\r\n  according to the position of the head of the humerus relative to the\r\n  glenoid cavity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  M’Fadyean and Vaughan term this muscle the scapulo-ulnaris, while\r\n  Arloing and Lesbre term it “Ancone accessoire du grand dorsal.” The\r\n  above name seems to agree best with the chief insertion and action,\r\n  although it certainly arises largely from the tendon of insertion of\r\n  the latissimus dorsi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  This is considered to represent the part of the common extensor for\r\n  the fourth and fifth digits.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  Martin considers that this muscle represents the extensor indicis\r\n  proprius and the part of the common extensor for the second digit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  In man the muscle is an extensor of the hand.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  On account of the intimate union between the psoas major and iliacus\r\n  they are frequently considered a single muscle, to which the name\r\n  ilio-psoas is applied; some anatomists include the psoas minor also\r\n  under this term.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  By some anatomists the portion inserted into the crest is termed the\r\n  gluteus accessorius, but Lesbre considers this the deep gluteus,\r\n  homologous with the gluteus minimus of man. The portion inserted into\r\n  the trochanteric ridge apparently represents the piriformis of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Apparently the muscle represents the biceps, together with part of the\r\n  gluteus superficialis of man. Hence the names gluteo-biceps and\r\n  paramero-biceps have been suggested.\r\n\r\nFootnote 65:\r\n\r\n  This muscle was incorrectly designated the adductor magnus by\r\n  Percivall and Strangeways. Its name, however, is not at all\r\n  descriptive of its structure in the domesticated animals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  It has been customary to describe two adductors—a parvus or brevis,\r\n  and a longus or magnus. This division is largely artificial, and has\r\n  been abandoned in the new nomenclature—a return to the views of\r\n  Bourgelat and Girard.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  This has been termed by various authors the adductor parvus or brevis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  Termed by various authors the adductor magnus or longus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  The iliac head is described by some authors as a separate muscle, and\r\n  termed the pyriformis. This does not seem desirable, especially since\r\n  it is at least probable that the homologue of the pyriformis of man is\r\n  that portion of the middle gluteus which is inserted into the back of\r\n  the trochanteric ridge.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  The name is based on the arrangement in man, in whom the muscle\r\n  consists of two fasciculi forming a groove between them for the tendon\r\n  of the obturator internus. In the horse it is undivided, and is\r\n  grooved for the obturator tendon, so that at first sight it appears to\r\n  be double. The gemellus may be regarded as the extrapelvic head of the\r\n  obturator internus (Gegenbaur).\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  While it is true that the separation of the intermedius is probably\r\n  never entirely a natural one in the horse, it varies in individual\r\n  cases, and is usually clear on cross-sections. In some subjects it is\r\n  possible to separate another slip which may represent the articularis\r\n  genu of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  It seems inadvisable to retain the old nomenclature, since it is\r\n  inapplicable to other domesticated animals in which the muscle is well\r\n  developed (_e. g._, ox, pig).\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  The soleus may, therefore, be included with the two heads of the\r\n  gastrocnemius under the name triceps suræ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  The origins of these heads are given in the order in which they may be\r\n  most conveniently dissected, not in order of size and importance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  This is probably the homologue of the subclavius of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  Movements of individual digits are specified with regard to the axis\r\n  of the manus (hand, paw), and not to the median plane of the body.\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  The term “mouth” is commonly used to signify either the oral cavity\r\n  (Cavum oris) or the entrance to it (Rima oris).\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  The epiglottis may be either in front of or behind the soft palate;\r\n  most often it is prevelar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n  In the undisturbed state of the parts there is no space between the\r\n  tongue and the rami of the lower jaw; consequently the tongue must be\r\n  drawn aside to see the sublingual crest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  It will be noted that this definition of crown and root does not agree\r\n  exactly with the popular view that the crown is the free portion and\r\n  the root the embedded portion. The objection to the latter statement\r\n  lies in the fact that it is not capable of general application. Thus\r\n  the morphological crown of the permanent molars in the horse is\r\n  extremely long, and is, for the most part, embedded in the bone in the\r\n  young animal. The root proper begins to form at four or five years of\r\n  age, and continues its growth for about eight years. As the exposed\r\n  part of the crown wears down, the embedded part pushes out of the\r\n  alveolus, thus preventing deficiency of length. On the old basis we\r\n  should have to say that successive portions of the root become crown,\r\n  while in point of fact it is only in very extreme age that the true\r\n  root comes into wear.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  Ellenberger found, as the result of extensive observations (8000\r\n  subjects), that about 2 to 3 per cent. of mares have erupted canines\r\n  in both jaws; that 6 to 7 per cent. have them in the upper jaw; while\r\n  20 to 30 per cent. have them in the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  It is interesting to notice that vestigial canines are not at all\r\n  uncommon in mares, especially in the lower jaw. They are very small,\r\n  and do not usually erupt; their presence is indicated in the latter\r\n  case by a prominence of the gum. This is in conformity with the fact\r\n  that they were present in both sexes in Eocene and Miocene ancestors\r\n  of existing equidæ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  It is common in veterinary works to call all the cheek teeth molars,\r\n  since, in the horse particularly, the premolars are molariform, _i.\r\n  e._, do not differ materially from the true molars in size or form.\r\n  The term cheek teeth conveniently includes the premolars and molars.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  The student is advised to amplify these very general statements by the\r\n  examination of heads of subjects of varying ages. It may also be noted\r\n  that the position of the septum between the two divisions of the sinus\r\n  varies much.\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  Careful observations (especially on frozen subjects and those in which\r\n  the organs have been hardened _in situ_) show that there is no\r\n  abdominal part of the œsophagus in the strict sense of the term. The\r\n  stomach here lies directly on the diaphragm, so that the last inch or\r\n  so of the œsophagus is placed obliquely in the hiatus œsophageus, and\r\n  is partly covered by the pleura, but not by peritoneum. In soft\r\n  subjects the weight of the stomach, or traction on it, draws part of\r\n  the œsophagus into the abdomen, inclosed in a collar of peritoneum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  The potential lumen is difficult to determine at all accurately. When\r\n  distended, its diameter (according to Rubeli) varies from 5.7 cm. at\r\n  its origin to 4 cm. at its cardiac end. The thickness of the wall\r\n  varies (inversely as the lumen) from 4 mm. to 1.2 cm. or more.\r\n\r\nFootnote 87:\r\n\r\n  At the origin of the tube muscular bundles arise on the raphé\r\n  pharyngis and blend with the crico-pharyngeus. Ventrally fibers come\r\n  from the depression between the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages.\r\n  Bundles of striped fibers may be continued in the superficial part of\r\n  the muscular coat as far as the cardia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 88:\r\n\r\n  This method of division, although long in use, is of very little value\r\n  for accurate description. It is mentioned here chiefly because\r\n  agreement on a more useful topographic method has not been arrived at.\r\n\r\nFootnote 89:\r\n\r\n  Only a general account of the arrangement of the peritoneum is given\r\n  in this section, since a detailed description cannot be understood\r\n  without a knowledge of the viscera concerned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  This is the position in the expiratory phase as usually seen in the\r\n  dead subject. In inspiration the saccus cæcus lies under the upper\r\n  parts of the sixteenth and seventeenth ribs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  This occlusion is usually so complete that distention of the stomach\r\n  by air or fluid forced in through the pylorus may be carried far\r\n  enough to rupture the stomach without ligating the œsophagus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  No natural line of demarcation exists, but there is a marked increase\r\n  of the thickness of the wall toward the terminal part. Other\r\n  differences will be noted in the further description.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  It will be noticed that the mesoduodenum is not continuous with the\r\n  great mesentery, but ends by a free edge. The mesentery begins on the\r\n  opposite surface of the end of the duodenum, so that the bowel is\r\n  attached by two peritoneal folds at this point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  Abnormal displacement, _e. g._, torsion of the left parts, is not\r\n  rare, and is liable to produce death if not promptly reduced.\r\n\r\nFootnote 95:\r\n\r\n  There is no natural line of demarcation between the small colon and\r\n  rectum: the plane of the pelvic inlet is selected for convenience of\r\n  description.\r\n\r\nFootnote 96:\r\n\r\n  The anterior part of the rectum is very variable in position and\r\n  relations. It is not often median, but may be deflected either to\r\n  right or left. Most often it is pushed to the left by the pelvic\r\n  flexure of the colon. In other cases—especially when empty—it may lie\r\n  against the right wall, and the space to the left is occupied by the\r\n  small colon. The amount covered by peritoneum dorsally and laterally\r\n  is very variable, and appears to be in inverse proportion to the\r\n  fullness of the bowel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 97:\r\n\r\n  A descriptive method based on that in use in human anatomy cannot be\r\n  applied with clearness to the organ in the horse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  These impressions are not evident on the soft organ. In hardened\r\n  material they are clearly mapped out, although of course variable in\r\n  size, in conformity with the degree of fullness of the various hollow\r\n  viscera. The cæcal impression may not be evident if, as often happens\r\n  in old horses, the right lobe of the liver is much atrophied.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  Flower and Ruge describe the mammalian liver as being primarily\r\n  divided by the umbilical fissure into two parts, the right and left\r\n  lobes. Secondary fissures on either side may subdivide each of these\r\n  primary lobes. On this basis we may recognize in the liver of the\r\n  horse right lateral, right central, left central, and left lateral\r\n  lobes. In the young foal these four lobes are distinctly recognizable.\r\n  The two central lobes would correspond to the middle lobe of the\r\n  foregoing description, and the right central lobe would be the\r\n  equivalent of the quadrate lobe of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  In the young foal the interlobular tissue is more abundant and the\r\n  lobulation correspondingly distinct.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  The hepatic veins may be recognized on section from the fact that they\r\n  remain open, being connected closely with the parenchyma.\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  The ductless glands are organs which elaborate substances which pass\r\n  directly into the veins or lymphatics, instead of being conveyed away\r\n  by ducts. This process is termed internal secretion. The ductless\r\n  glands include the lymph glands, which are described with the organs\r\n  of circulation; the thyroid and thymus bodies, described usually with\r\n  the respiratory organs; the adrenal or suprarenal bodies, described\r\n  with the urinary organs; the pineal and pituitary bodies, described\r\n  with the brain; and the spleen, described with the digestive system as\r\n  a matter of convenience. The spleen is not, strictly speaking, a gland\r\n  at all: it is not epithelial in origin or structure, but is\r\n  mesenchymatous.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  The student is strongly recommended to study the peritoneum of a foal\r\n  or other small subject when the opportunity occurs, as in these the\r\n  viscera are easily handled, and the course of the peritoneum can be\r\n  followed without difficulty.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  The passage is subject to a good deal of variation in caliber and is\r\n  sometimes completely occluded.\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  In dissecting-room subjects (which are usually aged) the omentum often\r\n  exhibits pathological changes, such as adhesions, rents, tumors,\r\n  formation of twisted strands, etc.\r\n\r\nFootnote 106:\r\n\r\n  The student will note here the difference between the structure and\r\n  behavior of the brachydont (short-crowned) incisors of the ox and the\r\n  hypsodont (long-crowned) type of the horse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  In popular language these are conveniently regarded as so many\r\n  stomachs, and termed accordingly “first,” “second,” etc. Other names\r\n  are in common use, _e. g._, paunch, honeycomb, manifold or manyplies,\r\n  and rennet or true stomach.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  It has been customary to term the sacs left and right respectively,\r\n  but these do not represent the relations as they exist _in situ_ and\r\n  as they are presented on frozen sections.\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  It is important to notice that the reticulum is separated from the\r\n  pericardium by an interval of about 1 to 1½ inches (ca. 2 to 4 cm.)\r\n  only, since foreign bodies which are often swallowed by cattle lodge\r\n  in the reticulum, and not rarely (if sharp) perforate the reticulum\r\n  and diaphragm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  The epiglottis in the pig seems to be constantly retrovelar. The pig\r\n  frequently breathes through the mouth, and this is no doubt possible\r\n  only when the soft palate is raised; it seems probable that it is also\r\n  shortened.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  The canines of the pig are “permanent pulp” teeth and therefore\r\n  capable of continued growth, and are without roots in the strict\r\n  sense.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  It is usually stated that the cardiac end is funnel-shaped, but it is\r\n  not so in formalin-hardened cadavers nor in frozen sections. The\r\n  hiatus œsophagus is a long slit in the right crus of the diaphragm,\r\n  and the terminal part of the œsophagus, which lies in it, is flattened\r\n  transversely.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  It will be noted that the fundus gland region does not extend up to\r\n  the lesser curvature; here the cardiac mucosa joins the pyloric.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  The description here given is based mainly on the appearance of the\r\n  organ as hardened _in situ_, which differs radically from that of the\r\n  soft organ, as is seen on comparison of the annexed figure (Fig. 321).\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  In the bulldog, which is very prognathic (“undershot”), the lower\r\n  canines are opposite to or slightly in front of the plane of the upper\r\n  incisors, and the upper canines are about opposite to the first lower\r\n  cheek teeth. In the epignathic (“overshot”) dachshund the lower\r\n  canines are under or slightly behind the upper ones.\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  Increase in number also occurs, the supernumerary teeth being at\r\n  either end of the series.\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  The valve does not seem to be efficient, since experience shows that\r\n  rectal injections can be made to pass beyond it. This may be partly\r\n  due also to the fact that the terminal part of the ileum runs\r\n  horizontally forward, and the ileo-cæcal orifice faces into the\r\n  beginning of the colon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  Ellenberger and Baum state that the cæcum may reach a length of 20 cm.\r\n  in very large dogs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 119:\r\n\r\n  When the stomach is very full, it pushes the left portion of the colon\r\n  over to the right, producing an acute angle in place of a transverse\r\n  branch. The terminal part of the colon is thus oblique in direction.\r\n\r\nFootnote 120:\r\n\r\n  An external nose (Nasus externus), such as exists in man, forming a\r\n  projection distinctly marked off from the rest of the face, does not\r\n  exist in the domesticated animals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 121:\r\n\r\n  The septal cartilage is to be regarded as an unossified part of the\r\n  mesethmoid. It will be noted that the line of demarcation between the\r\n  bone and the cartilage is irregular and varies with age; extensive\r\n  ossification for calcification) of the cartilage is commonly found in\r\n  old animals. The process often results in the formation of calcareous\r\n  islands in the cartilage.\r\n\r\nFootnote 122:\r\n\r\n  In the ordinary position of the head and neck, and while the parts are\r\n  at rest, about half of the larynx lies between the branches of the\r\n  mandible; when the head and neck are extended, proportionately more of\r\n  the larynx lies behind a plane through the posterior borders of the\r\n  rami. It is here described in the position it occupies when the head\r\n  and neck are extended.\r\n\r\nFootnote 123:\r\n\r\n  The term glottis is commonly used to designate the interval between\r\n  the vocal bands and arytenoid cartilages or the structures that\r\n  inclose that space.\r\n\r\nFootnote 124:\r\n\r\n  In so-called œdema glottidis this loose submucous tissue becomes\r\n  infiltrated with fluid, in some cases causing occlusion of the\r\n  vestibule.\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  The arrangement of the muscles should be noted, since the space\r\n  inclosed by the divergence of the sterno-cephalici and the convergence\r\n  of the omo-hyoidei is the area of election for the operation of\r\n  tracheotomy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 126:\r\n\r\n  The student should bear in mind that these terms are employed simply\r\n  as a matter of convenience in description; all the parts, though\r\n  differently named, form a continuous whole.\r\n\r\nFootnote 127:\r\n\r\n  The apertures do not exist in the fœtus, and are sometimes absent in\r\n  the adult subject. Some of them may be produced in dissection by the\r\n  necessary disturbance of the parts. Clinicians state that a serous\r\n  exudate formed in one pleural sac usually passes through to the other\r\n  side in the horse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 128:\r\n\r\n  A correct idea of the natural form and size of the lung cannot be\r\n  obtained from a specimen in this state. The lungs should be hardened\r\n  _in situ_ for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  Some authors consider each lung to be divided into anterior and\r\n  posterior lobes by the cardiac notch, so that the right lung would\r\n  have three lobes and the left lung two lobes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  In fœtal lung the lobulation is much more distinct. Pigmentation of\r\n  the lung is sometimes seen in horses, and in such cases the pigment is\r\n  deposited mainly in the interlobular tissue, thus mapping out the\r\n  lobules.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  It must not be inferred from the necessarily brief account here given\r\n  that the two sets of vessels are quite distinct. On the contrary,\r\n  competent observers state that numerous small branches of the\r\n  bronchial arteries anastomose with pulmonary vessels. Part of the\r\n  blood conveyed to the lungs by the bronchial arteries is returned by\r\n  the pulmonary veins. In the horse bronchial veins are absent or\r\n  inconstant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  The cervical part of the gland is very variable. The thoracic lobe of\r\n  one side may have no cervical continuation; the other lobe may then\r\n  give off a single prolongation which bifurcates. The thoracic part in\r\n  the new-born foal occupies most of the space which is later taken up\r\n  by the apices of the lungs. Its two lobes are in contact, and its deep\r\n  surface is molded on the anterior part of the pericardium and the\r\n  large vessels.\r\n\r\nFootnote 133:\r\n\r\n  It is therefore often termed the precardiac lobe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 134:\r\n\r\n  The arrangement here is one of the most striking features of the pig’s\r\n  larynx. The short, thick middle hyo-epiglottic ligament and the\r\n  anterior part of the thyro-hyoid membrane are inelastic, while the\r\n  posterior part of the membrane is thin and elastic and allows the\r\n  epiglottis to be separated by a considerable interval from the thyroid\r\n  cartilage. Moreover, the borders of the epiglottis are connected with\r\n  the thyroid cornua of the hyoid bone by lateral hyo-epiglottic\r\n  ligaments.\r\n\r\nFootnote 135:\r\n\r\n  The kidneys are soft, plastic organs, and hence an accurate knowledge\r\n  of their form can be gained only from a study of specimens which have\r\n  been hardened _in situ_. The description here given is based on this\r\n  method. For this purpose subjects should be hardened in the standing\r\n  position to avoid artefacts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 136:\r\n\r\n  The most instructive sections are those made in the horizontal and\r\n  transverse planes, through the pelvis in each case.\r\n\r\nFootnote 137:\r\n\r\n  The fœtal kidney is divided by furrows into a number of polygonal\r\n  areas, each of which is the base of a pyramidal lobe or renculus.\r\n  These furrows usually disappear before or soon after birth in the\r\n  foal, although traces of them are sometimes seen in the adult.\r\n\r\nFootnote 138:\r\n\r\n  In the kidney of the horse the renal columns dip in between the\r\n  pyramids very superficially as compared with the arrangement in the\r\n  human kidney. Breuer states that the pyramids are 40 to 64 in number,\r\n  and are arranged in four rows. Only the middle ones are distinct.\r\n\r\nFootnote 139:\r\n\r\n  The crest is the result of fusion of the papillæ or apices of the\r\n  pyramids in the embryo.\r\n\r\nFootnote 140:\r\n\r\n  This is commonly termed the fundus by veterinarians, but is not the\r\n  homologue of the fundus of the human bladder.\r\n\r\nFootnote 141:\r\n\r\n  This would correspond to the fundus vesicæ of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 142:\r\n\r\n  From the standpoint of comparative anatomy the term “adrenal” seems\r\n  decidedly preferable to “suprarenal.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 143:\r\n\r\n  This is a remnant of the gubernaculum testis of the fœtus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 144:\r\n\r\n  The tunica vaginalis is not a part of the scrotum in the strict or\r\n  narrow sense of that term, but is included here on practical grounds.\r\n\r\nFootnote 145:\r\n\r\n  Sometimes one vesicula or both are very large in the gelding. The\r\n  writer has seen four cases in the dissecting room, three of which were\r\n  bilateral, the other unilateral. The vesicula resembled the urinary\r\n  bladder in appearance and contained about a quart of thick,\r\n  amber-colored secretion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 146:\r\n\r\n  It has been customary to divide the pelvic part of the urethra into\r\n  prostatic and membranous parts. These terms apply well in human\r\n  anatomy, but have no special value in comparative anatomy. In the\r\n  horse a prostatic part hardly exists, unless we assume that it and the\r\n  neck of the bladder together are only about an inch in length. There\r\n  is no membranous part in the sense in which that term is used in\r\n  regard to man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 147:\r\n\r\n  The statement often made that it acts as a sphincter of the bladder is\r\n  a hypothesis of doubtful plausibility. In material hardened _in situ_,\r\n  in which the internal urethral orifice is tightly closed, the urethral\r\n  muscle apparently takes no part in the closure.\r\n\r\nFootnote 148:\r\n\r\n  This is clinically important, since enlargement of the prostate may\r\n  interfere with micturition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 149:\r\n\r\n  These terms apply properly only when the adjacent viscera are removed\r\n  and the ovaries are actually “suspended” by the broad ligaments. When\r\n  the ovary is in its natural position, the surfaces are dorsal and\r\n  ventral, the former corresponding to the “external” surface if the\r\n  free border is directed outward, to the “internal” if the free edge is\r\n  medial.\r\n\r\nFootnote 150:\r\n\r\n  The Fallopian tubes may be regarded, both in structure and morphology,\r\n  as prolongations of the uterus (McMurrich).\r\n\r\nFootnote 151:\r\n\r\n  The arrangement is the only exception to the general rule that the\r\n  serous cavities are closed. In this case the mucous membrane of the\r\n  fimbriated extremity is continuous with the adjacent peritoneum, a\r\n  persistence of the embryonic relations of the Müllerian duct.\r\n\r\nFootnote 152:\r\n\r\n  In formalin-hardened subjects there is frequently a pronounced\r\n  ring-like constriction at the beginning of the vulva.\r\n\r\nFootnote 153:\r\n\r\n  The term vulva is used here in the sense in which it is understood\r\n  generally by English and French veterinarians. In the German works it\r\n  is applied only to the labia and other structures around the external\r\n  orifice of the urogenital sinus, while the sinus itself is termed the\r\n  vestibule of the vagina (Vestibulum vaginæ).\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  Lesbre states that the cornua may attain a length of 45 to 50 cm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  The pericardium is described before the heart since it must be\r\n  examined first in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  This is termed the tubercle of Lower in human anatomy and the\r\n  tuberculum intervenosum by German veterinary anatomists.\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  These vessels will be described later in their systematic order.\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  The relation to the guttural pouch is not constant. In some\r\n  cases—especially when the head and neck are extended—the artery lies\r\n  behind the pouch. The backward extension of the latter is variable.\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  By some authors the term facial is applied to the artery only after it\r\n  turns around the lower border of the jaw.\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  The artery is conveniently placed at its inflection for taking the\r\n  pulse, since it is superficial and lies directly on the bone.\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  This vessel appears to represent both the supraorbital and frontal of\r\n  man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:\r\n\r\n  The term axillary is often applied to the artery from the first rib to\r\n  the point of origin of the subscapular branch.\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  The pulse can be taken where the artery lies on the lateral ligament,\r\n  since the pectoral muscle is thin here.\r\n\r\nFootnote 164:\r\n\r\n  This vessel is also termed the A. metacarpea volaris superficialis or\r\n  the palmar metacarpal artery.\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  In the great majority of subjects this vessel and some of its branches\r\n  are the seat of more or less extensive verminous aneurysm, produced by\r\n  the Sclerostomum armatum. In the author’s experience an entirely\r\n  normal specimen is quite exceptional in adult horses.\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  The left branch is a descriptive convention rather than a reality,\r\n  since the arteries of the small intestines spring from the mesenteric\r\n  trunk either directly or by short common stems with an adjacent\r\n  vessel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  The obliteration in the adult extends a variable distance from the\r\n  vesical end toward the origin, but usually involves only a small part.\r\n\r\nFootnote 168:\r\n\r\n  Most of the veins are depicted in the illustrations of the section on\r\n  the arteries, to which reference is to be made.\r\n\r\nFootnote 169:\r\n\r\n  Chauveau says “the bronchial veins, which ramify on the bronchi like\r\n  the arteries of which they are satellites, open into the great\r\n  coronary vein very near its mouth, after having united to form a\r\n  single vessel, which sometimes opens directly into the atrium.”\r\n  Ellenberger and Baum state that the bronchial and œsophageal veins\r\n  open into the vena azygos separately or by a common trunk. Martin\r\n  describes a short broncho-œsophageal trunk, but the vein which he\r\n  figures as the bronchial does not come from the lungs, but is a small\r\n  mediastinal vessel. The author finds such a vessel entering the\r\n  terminal part of the œsophageal vein, but no distinct bronchial vein\r\n  in the horse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 170:\r\n\r\n  M’Fadyean records a case in which the vein lay on the deep face of the\r\n  omo-hyoideus with the carotid artery.\r\n\r\nFootnote 171:\r\n\r\n  The venous angle formed by this junction indicates the position of the\r\n  thyroid gland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 172:\r\n\r\n  These are termed by Chauveau and M’Fadyean the subsphenoidal\r\n  confluents.\r\n\r\nFootnote 173:\r\n\r\n  The place and mode of termination is quite variable. It may disappear\r\n  from the surface of the thigh at any point above the distal third. In\r\n  some cases it passes through the anterior part of the gracilis instead\r\n  of dipping in between that muscle and the sartorius.\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  This often joins the posterior femoral or the popliteal vein.\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  The term chyle is often applied to the lymph carried by the efferent\r\n  vessels of the intestine when it contains products of digestion, and\r\n  these vessels may be designated as lacteals or chyle vessels.\r\n\r\nFootnote 176:\r\n\r\n  The lymph vessels of these organs appear to vary considerably in their\r\n  mode of termination, and the arrangement needs further study. Some\r\n  ducts from the stomach, liver, and spleen open directly into the\r\n  cistern.\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  Abscess here can be reached readily by an incision between the vein\r\n  and the omo-hyoideus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  It is, of course, only the pericardium which comes in contact with the\r\n  wall, but it is customary as a matter of convenience to speak of the\r\n  relation of the heart as though it were direct.\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  Only the most important differential features of the arrangement of\r\n  the vessels as compared with those of the horse will be considered.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  The homologies of the vessels of the lower parts of the limbs are\r\n  still uncertain. The account given here is mainly based on the views\r\n  of Sussdorf and Baum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  It is difficult to make the arrangement of these vessels clear in a\r\n  brief textual description, but a reference to the schematic figure\r\n  will explain the main facts.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  Most of the differences in the veins of the ox are correlated with\r\n  those of the arteries of which they are satellites and will not be\r\n  described. The account here given consists chiefly of those\r\n  differential features which could not be deduced from a knowledge of\r\n  the arteries.\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  The upper series is continuous with the posterior mediastinal\r\n  (œsophageal) glands and the lower or tracheal glands with the\r\n  bronchial. Hence we might well designate the mediastinal glands as\r\n  œsophageal (anterior and posterior) and tracheo-bronchial.\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  When enlarged, as is often the case in tuberculosis, this gland\r\n  frequently causes difficulty in swallowing and in rumination and\r\n  produces chronic or recurrent bloating.\r\n\r\nFootnote 185:\r\n\r\n  The relative weight is subject to wide variation. It is large in\r\n  hunting dogs and such as are trained for speed or worked.\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  Limitations of space and the purpose of this work preclude\r\n  consideration of the finer structure of the nervous system, for which\r\n  ample literature is available.\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  The description given here is intended to present the chief facts in\r\n  regard to the brain as they may be studied in the dissecting room. The\r\n  vessels and membranes which must be examined first have been\r\n  described.\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  Unless care is used in removing the brain the infundibulum is likely\r\n  to be torn and the pituitary body left in the cranium. In this case\r\n  there is a small opening which communicates with the third ventricle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 189:\r\n\r\n  The fossa corresponds in position to the locus perforatus anticus of\r\n  the human brain, but is not pierced by numerous openings for vessels\r\n  in the horse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 190:\r\n\r\n  The decussation varies superficially in different specimens. In some\r\n  there is a distinct superficial crossing of fibers so that the median\r\n  fissure is practically effaced at this point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 191:\r\n\r\n  In the new nomenclature the term lamina quadrigemina is applied to the\r\n  dorsal mass of the mid-brain, and the four eminences which it bears\r\n  are the corpora quadrigemina.\r\n\r\nFootnote 192:\r\n\r\n  In man a distinct superior brachium connects the superior pair with\r\n  the lateral geniculate body, but in the domesticated animals the union\r\n  with the optic thalamus is too direct to allow of any definite arm\r\n  being recognized.\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  On a strictly embryological basis the optic part of the hypothalamus,\r\n  comprising the anterior part of the third ventricle and the structures\r\n  associated with it, belong to the telencephalon, but will be\r\n  considered here as a matter of convenience.\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  This backward projection of the thalamus is equivalent to the pulvinar\r\n  and lateral geniculate body of man, which are not superficially\r\n  divided in the domestic animals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  In order to study the configuration of the hemisphere it should be\r\n  separated from its fellow by median section and from the brain stem by\r\n  cutting across the mid-brain. Material for this purpose should be\r\n  hardened _in situ_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  Termed by Lesbre the parietal fissure and by M’Fadyean the great\r\n  oblique fissure.\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  Just above this point is a lobe which is homologous with the insula of\r\n  man. When the overhanging gyri which partly conceal it—forming the\r\n  operculum—are removed, there are disclosed several short, deeply\r\n  placed gyri (Gyri breves).\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  By some authors this is regarded as the homologue of the cruciate\r\n  fissure of the dog, but it seems likely that the latter is represented\r\n  by a short and inconstant sulcus situated further forward.\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  From the morphological point of view other structures should be\r\n  included, but in descriptive anatomy it is usual to limit the\r\n  application of the term to the parts enumerated above.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  It is generally believed that these constitute an olfactory path.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  It is hardly possible to get an accurate idea of the shape of the\r\n  ventricle except by studying a cast of it. The size of the ventricles\r\n  varies in different subjects, and it is not rare to find more or less\r\n  disparity between the two ventricles of the same brain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  The term arose from the striated appearance of the mass in sections\r\n  cut in certain planes, the gray matter being cut up into strands by\r\n  tracts of white fibers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  Although this nerve springs directly from the ganglion, it contains\r\n  motor as well as sensory fibers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  This ganglion appears to be equivalent to the jugular or superior and\r\n  petrous ganglia of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  In some cases the left vagus passes back below the junction of the\r\n  jugular veins and the termination of the left brachial vein. It then\r\n  runs backward and somewhat dorsally across the left face of the\r\n  anterior vena cava to reach its usual position.\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  The nerve lies here about a finger’s breadth above the thyroid gland.\r\n  If, however, the gland is enlarged it may come in contact with the\r\n  nerve. The same is true in regard to the relation to the anterior\r\n  cervical lymph glands.\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:\r\n\r\n  In order to examine the plexus and the origins of its chief branches\r\n  conveniently and with as little disturbance of relation as possible,\r\n  the subject should be suspended in imitation of the natural position\r\n  and the fore limb abducted as much as is necessary.\r\n\r\nFootnote 208:\r\n\r\n  Morphologically the last-named muscle belongs to the extensor group.\r\n  In man and in the dog and many other animals it is an extensor in\r\n  function.\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\n  In veterinary works these are frequently termed plantar nerves, which\r\n  is an unfortunate misnomer. The writer inclines to the use of the old\r\n  term metacarpal or common digital to designate the nerves as far as\r\n  their divisions, and the term digital beyond this.\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\n  The special statements of this description refer to the system of the\r\n  horse. A few important differential features will be mentioned in the\r\n  account of the nervous system of the other animals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\n  The right and left plexuses communicate with each other, so that both\r\n  lungs receive fibers from both vagi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\n  It has been customary to designate these in veterinary works as the\r\n  semilunar or cœliac ganglia, but in the horse they evidently include\r\n  the anterior mesenteric ganglia as well.\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:\r\n\r\n  A good preparation of the ganglia in the horse is often difficult to\r\n  obtain on account of aneurysm of the artery and the formation of a\r\n  quantity of connective tissue about it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n  Only the most salient differences as compared with the horse will be\r\n  mentioned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  The origin of the lacrimal nerve is such that Ellenberger-Baum and\r\n  Martin describe it as a branch of the maxillary nerve.\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  Lesbre terms this the tracheo-œsophageal branch, and considers that it\r\n  must be regarded as an accessory or internal recurrent nerve.\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  This belongs to the upper eyelid, but is described here on account of\r\n  its position.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  According to Piersol the system of spaces and canaliculi in the\r\n  substantia propria is completely filled by the cells and their\r\n  processes, upon which the nutrition of the cornea largely depends. The\r\n  lamina elastica anterior, formerly described as a distinct layer\r\n  between the corneal epithelium and the substantia propria, does not\r\n  exist as such, but there is a condensation of the superficial part, of\r\n  the latter, which Rollett termed the anterior limiting layer; it is\r\n  not elastic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  In albinos the pigment is absent here, as elsewhere, and the iris is\r\n  pinkish in color.\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\n  For the minute structure of the retina reference must be made to\r\n  histological works.\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\n  Ellenberger and Baum regard this as the homologue of the transversus\r\n  and obliquus auriculæ of man.\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\n  There is, strictly speaking, no osseous part of the tube such as\r\n  occurs in man. In the horse the cartilage extends to the tympanic\r\n  orifice.\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\n  For the finer structure reference is to be made to the histological\r\n  literature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\n  This muscle has been described in the Myology.\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  To prevent a possible misapprehension, it may be stated that the\r\n  epidermis primarily molds the corium, and that the glands and\r\n  hair-follicles are invaginations of the epidermis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:\r\n\r\n  The hoof may be loosened and removed intact by allowing the foot to\r\n  macerate or by boiling it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 227:\r\n\r\n  The term foot is used here in the popular sense, _i. e._, to designate\r\n  the hoof and the structures inclosed within it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 228:\r\n\r\n  The wide groove at the heels, however, contains chiefly the matrix of\r\n  the periople.\r\n\r\nFootnote 229:\r\n\r\n  The lower punctum lacrimale is frequently absent and the corresponding\r\n  duct therefore blind. There is often a duct or its remnant which opens\r\n  below the inferior turbinal fold, but is not connected behind with the\r\n  functional duct.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n Page           Changed from                      Changed to\r\n\r\n  149 arch; _t_, _t′_, superior        arch; _t_, _t′_, superior\r\n      ischiatic spine; _n_,            ischiatic spine; _u_,\r\n      acetabulum; _v_, epiphyseal line acetabulum; _v_, epiphyseal line\r\n\r\n ● Typos fixed; non-standard spelling and dialect retained.\r\n ● Used numbers for footnotes, placing them all at the end of the last\r\n     chapter.\r\n ● Enclosed italics font in _underscores_.\r\n ● Enclosed bold font in =equals=.\r\n ● The caret (^) serves as a superscript indicator, applicable to\r\n     individual characters (like 2^d) and even entire phrases (like\r\n     1^{st}).\r\n ● Subscripts are shown using an underscore (_) with curly braces { },\r\n     as in H_{2}O.",
