Thule I knew, or at least I\r\nhad heard of the king who reigned there once and who cast his goblet\r\ninto the sea. But Ultima Thule! was not that beyond the uttermost\r\nborders of the earth?\r\n\r\n\"Any passengers?\" was the next query, and I noted that the voice came\r\nnow from the left and was almost abreast of us.\r\n\r\n\"One only,\" responded the captain of our boat.\r\n\r\n\"Where bound?\" was the final inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"To the Fortunate Islands!\" was the answer; and as I heard this my\r\nspirits rose again, and I was glad, as what man would not be who was on\r\nhis way to the paradise where the crimson-flowered meadows are full of\r\nthe shade of frankincense-trees and of fruits of gold?\r\n\r\nThen the boat bounded forward again, and I heard the wash of the waves.\r\n\r\nAll this time it seemed as though I were in darkness; but now I began\r\ndimly to discern the objects about me. I found that I was lying on a\r\nsettee in a state-room at the stern of the vessel. Through the small\r\nround window over my head the first rays of the rising sun darted and\r\nsoon lighted the little cabin.\r\n\r\nAs I looked about me with curiosity, wondering how I came to be a\r\npassenger on so unexpected a voyage, I saw the figure of a man framed\r\nin the doorway at the foot of the stairs leading to the deck above.\r\n\r\nHow it was I do not know, but I made sure at once that he was the\r\ncaptain of the ship, the man whose voice I had heard answering the\r\nhail.\r\n\r\nHe was tall and dark, with a scant beard and a fiery and piercing gaze,\r\nwhich penetrated me as I faced him. Yet the expression of his\r\ncountenance was not unfriendly; nor could any man lay eyes upon him\r\nwithout a movement of pity for the sadness written on his visage.\r\n\r\nI rose to my feet as he came forward.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, holding out his hand, \"and how are you after your\r\nnap?\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke our language with ease and yet with a foreign accent. Perhaps\r\nit was this which betrayed him to me.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not Captain Vanderdecken?\" I asked as I took his hand\r\nheartily.\r\n\r\n\"So you know me?\" he returned, with a mournful little laugh, as he\r\nmotioned to me to sit down again.\r\n\r\nThus the ice was broken, and he took his seat by my side, and we were\r\nsoon deep in talk.\r\n\r\nWhen he learned that I was a loyal New-Yorker, his cordiality\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\"I have relatives in New Amsterdam,\" he cried; \"at least I had once.\r\nDiedrich Knickerbocker was my first cousin. And do you know Rip Van\r\nWinkle?\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I could not claim any close friendship with this gentleman, I\r\nboasted myself fully acquainted with his history.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Captain Vanderdecken, \"I suppose he was before your\r\ntime. Most people are so short-lived nowadays; it's only with that\r\nWandering Jew now that I ever have a chat over old times. Well, well,\r\nbut you have heard of Rip? Were you ever told that I was on a visit to\r\nHendrik Hudson the night Rip went up the mountain and took a drop too\r\nmuch?\"\r\n\r\nI had to confess that here was a fact I had not before known.\r\n\r\n\"I ran up the river,\" said the Hollander, \"to have a game of bowls with\r\nthe Englishman and his crew, nearly all of them countrymen of mine;\r\nand, by-the-way, Hudson always insists that it was I who brought the\r\nstorm with me that gave poor Rip Van Winkle the rheumatism as he slept\r\noff his intoxication on the hillside under the pines. He was a good\r\nfellow, Rip, and a very good judge of schnapps, too.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing him smile with the pleasant memories of past companionship, I\r\nmarvelled when the sorrowful expression swiftly covered his face again\r\nas a mask.\r\n\r\n\"But why talk of those who are dead and gone and are happy?\" he asked\r\nin his deep voice. \"Soon there will be no one left, perhaps, but\r\nAhasuerus and Vanderdecken--the Wandering Jew and the Flying Dutchman.\"\r\n\r\nHe sighed bitterly, and then he gave a short, hard laugh.\r\n\r\n\"There's no use talking about these things, is there?\" he cried. \"In an\r\nhour or two, if the wind holds, I can show you the house in which\r\nAhasuerus has established his museum, the only solace of his lonely\r\nlife. He has the most extraordinary gathering of curiosities the world\r\nhas ever seen--truly a virtuoso's collection. An American reporter came\r\non a voyage with me fifty or sixty years ago, and I took him over\r\nthere. His name was Hawthorne. He interviewed the Jew, and wrote up the\r\ncollection in the American papers, so I've been told.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember reading the interview,\" I said, \"and it was indeed a most\r\nremarkable collection.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all the more curious now for the odds and ends I've been able to\r\npick up here and there for my old friend,\" Vanderdecken declared; \"I\r\ngot him the horn of Hernani, the harpoon with which Long Tom Coffin\r\npinned the British officer to the mast, the long rifle of Natty Bumppo,\r\nthe letter A in scarlet cloth embroidered in gold by Hester Prynne, the\r\nbanner with the strange device 'Excelsior,' the gold bug which was once\r\nused as a plummet, Maud Muller's rake, and the jack-knives of Hosea\r\nBiglow and Sam Lawson.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have seen extraordinary things yourself,\" I ventured to\r\nsuggest.\r\n\r\n\"No man has seen stranger,\" he answered, promptly. \"No man has ever\r\nbeen witness to more marvellous deeds than I--not even Ahasuerus, I\r\nverily believe, for he has only the land, and I have the boundless sea.\r\nI survey mankind from China to Peru. I have heard the horns of elfland\r\nblowing, and I could tell you the song the sirens sang. I have dropped\r\nanchor at the No Man's Land, and off Lyonesse, and in Xanadu, where\r\nAlph the sacred river ran. I have sailed from the still-vexed\r\nBermoothes to the New Atlantis, of which there is no mention even until\r\nthe year 1629.\"\r\n\r\n\"In which year there was published an account of it written in the\r\nLatin tongue, but by an Englishman,\" I said, desirous to reveal my\r\nacquirements.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen every strange coast,\" continued the Flying Dutchman. \"The\r\nIsland of Bells and Robinson Crusoe's Island and the Kingdoms of\r\nBrobdingnag and Lilliput. But it is not for me to vaunt myself for my\r\nvoyages. And of a truth there are men I should like to have met and\r\ntalked with whom I have yet failed to see. Especially is there one\r\nUlysses, a sailor-man of antiquity who called himself Outis, whence I\r\nhave sometimes suspected that he came from the town of Weissnichtwo.\"\r\n\r\nJust to discover what Vanderdecken would say, I inquired innocently\r\nwhether this was the same person as one Captain Nemo of whose submarine\r\nexploits I had read.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Nemo?\" the Flying Dutchman repeated scornfully. \"I never heard\r\nof him. Are you sure there is such a fellow?\"\r\n\r\nI tried to turn the conversation by asking if he had ever met another\r\nancient mariner named Charon.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" was his answer. \"Charon keeps the ferry across the Styx to\r\nthe Elysian Fields, past the sunless marsh of Acheron. Yes--I've met\r\nhim more than once. I met him only last month, and he was very proud of\r\nhis new electric launch with its storage battery.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I expressed my surprise at this, he asked me if I did not know\r\nthat the underworld was now lighted by electricity, and that Pluto had\r\nput in all the modern improvements. Before I had time to answer, he\r\nrose from his seat and slapped me on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Come up with me!--if you want to behold things for yourself,\" he\r\ncried. \"So far, it seems to me, you have never seen the sights!\"\r\n\r\nI followed him on deck. The sun was now two hours high, and I could\r\njust make out a faint line of land on the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"That rugged coast is Bohemia, which is really a desert country by the\r\nsea, although ignorant and bigoted pedants have dared to deny it,\" and\r\nthe scorn of my companion as he said this was wonderful to see. \"Its\r\nborders touch Alsatia, of which the chief town is a city of refuge. Not\r\nfar inland, but a little to the south, is the beautiful Forest of\r\nArden, where men and maids dwell together in amity, and where clowns\r\nwander, making love to shepherdesses. Some of these same pestilent\r\npedants have pretended to believe that this forest of Arden was\r\nsituated in France, which is absurd, as there are no serpents and no\r\nlions in France, while we have the best of evidence as to the existence\r\nof both in Arden--you know that, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nI admitted that a green and gilded snake and a lioness with udders all\r\ndrawn dry were known to have been seen there both on the same day. I\r\nventured to suggest further that possibly this Forest of Arden was the\r\nWandering Wood where Una met her lion.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" was the curt response; \"everybody knows that Arden is a\r\nmost beautiful region; even the toads there have precious jewels in\r\ntheir heads. And if you range the forest freely you may chance to find\r\nalso the White Doe of Rylstone and the goat with the gilded horns that\r\ntold fortunes in Paris long ago by tapping with his hoof on a\r\ntambourine.\"\r\n\r\n\"These, then, are the Happy Hunting-Grounds?\" I suggested with a light\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"Who would chase a tame goat?\" he retorted with ill-concealed contempt\r\nfor my ill-advised remark.\r\n\r\nI thought it best to keep silence; and after a minute or two he resumed\r\nthe conversation, like one who is glad of a good listener.\r\n\r\n\"In the outskirts of the Forest of Arden,\" he began again, \"stands\r\nthe Abbey of Thelema--the only abbey which is bounded by no wall\r\nand in which there is no clock at all nor any dial. And what need is\r\nthere of knowing the time when one has for companions only comely and\r\nwell-conditioned men and fair women of sweet disposition? And the motto\r\nof the Abbey of Thelema is _Fais ce que voudra_--Do what you will; and\r\nmany of those who dwell in the Forest of Arden will tell you that they\r\nhave taken this also for their device, and that if you live under the\r\ngreenwood tree you may spend your life--as you like it.\"\r\n\r\nI acknowledged that this claim was probably well founded, since I\r\nrecalled a song of the foresters in which they declared themselves\r\nwithout an enemy but winter and rough weather.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he went on, \"they are fond of singing in the Forest of Arden,\r\nand they sing good songs. And so they do in the fair land beyond where\r\nI have never been, and which I can never hope to go to see for myself,\r\nif all that they report be true--and yet what would I not give to see\r\nit and to die there.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he said this sadly, his voice sank into a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"And where does the road through the forest lead, that you so much wish\r\nto set forth upon it?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"That's the way to Arcady,\" he said--\"to Arcady where all the leaves\r\nare merry. I may not go there, though I long for it. Those who attain\r\nto its borders never come back again--and why should they leave it? Yet\r\nthere are tales told, and I have heard that this Arcady is the\r\nveritable El Dorado, and that in it is the true Fountain of Youth,\r\ngushing forth unfailingly for the refreshment of all who may reach it.\r\nBut no one may find the entrance who cannot see it by the light that\r\nnever was on land or sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be a favored region,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Of a truth it is,\" he answered; \"and on the way there is the orchard\r\nwhere grow the golden apples of Hesperides, and the dragon is dead now\r\nthat used to guard them, and so any one may help himself to the\r\nbeautiful fruit. And by the side of the orchard flows the river Lethe,\r\nof which it is not well for man to drink, though many men would taste\r\nit gladly.\" And again he sighed.\r\n\r\nI knew not what to say, and so waited for him to speak once more.\r\n\r\n\"That promontory there on the weather bow,\" he began again after a few\r\nmoments' silence, \"that is Barataria, which was long supposed to be an\r\nisland by its former governor, Don Sancho Panza, but which is now known\r\nby all to be connected with the mainland. Pleasant pastures slope down\r\nto the water, and if we were closer in shore you might chance to see\r\nRozinante, the famous charger of Don Quixote de la Mancha, grazing\r\namicably with the horse that brought the good news from Ghent to Aix.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could see them!\" I cried, enthusiastically; \"but there is\r\nanother horse I would rather behold than any--the winged steed\r\nPegasus.\"\r\n\r\nBefore responding, my guide raised his hand and shaded his eyes and\r\nscanned the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said at last. \"I cannot descry any this afternoon. Sometimes\r\nin these latitudes I have seen a dozen hippogriffs circling about the\r\nship, and I should like to have shown them to you. Perhaps they are all\r\nin the paddock at the stock-farm, where Apollo is now mating them with\r\nnight-mares in the hope of improving the breed from which he selects\r\nthe coursers that draw the chariot of the sun. They say that the\r\nexperiment would have more chance of success if it were easier to find\r\nthe night-mares' nests.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not a hippogriff I desired to see especially,\" I returned when\r\nhe paused, \"although that would be interesting, no doubt. It was the\r\nrenowned Pegasus himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pegasus is much like the other hippogriffs,\" he retorted, \"although\r\nperhaps he has a little better record than any of them. But they say he\r\nhas not won a single aerial handicap since that American professor of\r\nyours harnessed him to a one-hoss shay. That seemed to break his\r\nspirit, somehow; and I'm told he would shy now even at a broomstick\r\ntrain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even if he is out of condition,\" I declared, \"Pegasus is still the\r\nsteed I desire to see above all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't set eyes on him for weeks,\" was the answer, \"so he is\r\nprobably moulting; this is the time of year. He has a roomy boxstall in\r\nthe new Augean stable at the foot of Mount Parnassus. You know they\r\nhave turned the spring of Castaly so that it flows through the\r\nstable-yard now, and so it is easy enough to keep the place clean.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I may not see Pegasus,\" I asked, \"is there any chance of my being\r\ntaken to the Castle of the Sleeping Beauty?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never seen it myself,\" he replied, \"and so I cannot show it to\r\nyou. Rarely indeed may I leave the deck of my ship to go ashore; and\r\nthis castle that you ask about is very far inland. I am told that it is\r\nin a country which the French travellers call _La Scribie_, a curious\r\nland, wherein the scene is laid of many a play, because its laws and\r\nits customs are exactly what every playwright has need of; but no poet\r\nhas visited it for many years. Yet the Grand Duchess of Gerolstein,\r\nwhose domains lie partly within the boundaries of Scribia, is still a\r\nsubscriber to the _Gazette de Hollande_--the only newspaper I take\r\nhimself, by the way.\"\r\n\r\nThis last remark of the Captain's explained how it was that he had\r\nbeen able to keep up with the news of the day, despite his constant\r\nwanderings over the waste of waters; and what more natural in fact than\r\nthat the Flying Dutchman should be a regular reader of the _Holland\r\nGazette_?\r\n\r\nVanderdecken went forward into the prow of the vessel, calling to me to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see those peaks afar in the distance?\" he asked, pointing over\r\nthe starboard bow.\r\n\r\nI could just make out a saw-like outline in the direction indicated.\r\n\r\n\"Those are the Delectable Mountains,\" he informed me; \"and down on a\r\nhollow between the two ranges is the Happy Valley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where Rasselas lived?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied, \"and beyond the Delectable Mountains, on the far\r\nslope, lies Prester John's Kingdom, and there dwell anthropophagi, and\r\nmen whose heads do grow beneath their shoulders. At least, so they say.\r\nFor my part, I have never seen any such. And I have now no desire to go\r\nto Prester John's Kingdom, since I have been told that he has lately\r\nmarried Pope Joan. Do you see that grove of trees there at the base of\r\nthe mountains?\"\r\n\r\nI answered that I thought I could distinguish weirdly contorted\r\nbranches and strangely shivering foliage.\r\n\r\n\"That is the deadly upas-tree,\" he explained, \"and it is as much as a\r\nman's life is worth to lie down in the shade of its twisted limbs. I\r\nslept there, on that point where the trees are the thickest, for a\r\nfortnight a century or so ago--but all I had for my pains was a\r\nheadache. Still I should not advise you to adventure yourself under the\r\nshadow of those melancholy boughs.\"\r\n\r\nI confess at once that I was little prompted to a visit so dangerous\r\nand so profitless.\r\n\r\n\"Profitless?\" he repeated. \"As to that I am not so certain, for if you\r\nhave a mind to see the rarest animals in the world, you could there\r\nsate your curiosity. On the shore, between the foot-hills and the grove\r\nof upas, is a park of wild beasts, the like of which no man has looked\r\nupon elsewhere. Even from the deck of this ship I have seen more than\r\nonce a drove of unicorns, or a herd of centaurs, come down to the water\r\nto drink; and sometimes I have caught a pleasant glimpse of satyrs and\r\nfauns dancing in the sunlight. And once indeed--I shall never forget\r\nthat extraordinary spectacle--as I sped past with every sail set and a\r\nten-knot breeze astern, I saw the phoenix blaze up in its new birth,\r\nwhile the little salamanders frisked in the intense flame.\"\r\n\r\n\"The phoenix?\" I cried. \"You have seen the phoenix?\"\r\n\r\n\"In just this latitude,\" he answered, \"but it was about nine o'clock in\r\nthe evening and I remember that the new moon was setting behind the\r\nmountains when I happened to come on deck.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was the phoenix like?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" he replied, \"the bird was almost as Herodotus described her,\r\nof the make and size of the eagle, with a plumage partly red and partly\r\ngolden. If we go by the point by noon, perhaps you may see her for\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she there still?\" I asked, in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he returned. \"All the game of this sort is carefully\r\npreserved and the law is off on phoenixes only once in a century.\r\nWhy, if it were not for the keepers, there soon would not be a single\r\ngriffin or dragon left, not a single sphinx, not a single chimaera. Even\r\nas it is, I am told they do not breed as freely now as when they could\r\nroam the whole world in safety. That is why the game laws are so\r\nrigorous. Indeed, I am informed and believe that it is not permitted to\r\nkill the were-wolves even when their howling, as they run at large at\r\nnight, prevents all sleep. It is true, of course, that very few people\r\ncare to remain in such a neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think not,\" I agreed. \"And what manner of people are they who\r\ndare to live here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Along the shore there are a few harpies,\" he answered; \"and now and\r\nthen I have seen a mermaid on the rocks combing her hair with a golden\r\ncomb as she sang to herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harpies?\" I repeated, in disgust. \"Why not the sea-serpent also?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a sea-serpent which lived for years in that cove yonder,\"\r\nsaid the Captain, pointing to a pleasant bay on the starboard, \"but I\r\nhave not seen it lately. Unless I am in error, it had a pitched battle\r\nhereabouts with a kraken. I don't remember who got the better of the\r\nfight--but I haven't seen the snake since.\"\r\n\r\nAs I scanned the surface of the water to see if I might not detect some\r\ntrace of one or another of these marvellous beasts of the sea, I\r\nremarked a bank of fog lying across our course.\r\n\r\n\"And what is this that we are coming to?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"That?\" Captain Vanderdecken responded, indicating the misty outline\r\nstraight before us. \"That is Altruria--at least it is so down in the\r\ncharts, but I have never set eyes on it actually. It belongs to Utopia,\r\nyou know; and they say that, although it is now on the level of the\r\nearth, it used once to be a flying island--the same which was formerly\r\nknown as Laputa, and which was first visited and described by Captain\r\nLemuel Gulliver about the year 1727, or a little earlier.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that is Altruria,\" I said, trying in vain to see it more clearly.\r\n\"There was an Altrurian in New York not long ago, but I had no chance\r\nof speech with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are pleasant folk, those Altrurians,\" said the Captain, \"although\r\nrather given to boasting. And they have really little enough to brag\r\nabout, after all. Their climate is execrable--I find it ever windy\r\nhereabouts, and when I get in sight of that bank of fog, I always look\r\nout for squalls. I don't know just what the population is now, but I\r\ndoubt if it is growing. You see, people talk about moving there to\r\nlive, but they are rarely in a hurry to do it, I notice. Nor are the\r\nmanufactures of the Altrurians as many as they were said to be. Their\r\nchief export now is the famous Procrustean bed; although the old house\r\nof Damocles & Co. still does a good business in swords. Their tonnage\r\nis not what it used to be, and I'm told that they are issuing a good\r\ndeal of paper money now to try and keep the balance of trade in their\r\nfavor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there not many poets among the inhabitants of Altruria?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"They are all poets and romancers of one kind or another,\" declared the\r\nCaptain. \"Come below again into the cabin, and I will show you some of\r\ntheir books.\"\r\n\r\nThe sky was now overcast and there was a chill wind blowing, so I was\r\nnot at all loath to leave the deck, and to follow Vanderdecken down the\r\nsteps into the cabin.\r\n\r\nHe took a thin volume from the table. \"This,\" he said, \"is one of their\r\nbooks--'News from Nowhere,' it is called.\"\r\n\r\nHe extended it towards me, and I held out my hand for it, but it\r\nslipped through my fingers. I started forward in a vain effort to seize\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAs I did so, the walls and the floor of the cabin seemed to melt away\r\nand to dissolve in air, and beyond them and taking their place were the\r\nwalls and floor of my own house. Then suddenly the clock on the\r\nmantelpiece struck five, and I heard a bob-tail car rattling and\r\nclattering past the door on its way across town to Union Square, and\r\nthence to Greenwich Village, and so on down to the Hoboken Ferry.\r\n\r\nThen I found myself on my own sofa, bending forward to pick up the\r\nvolume of Cyrano de Bergerac, which lay on the carpet at my feet. I sat\r\nup erect and collected my thoughts as best I could after so strange a\r\njourney. And I wondered why it was that no one had ever prepared a\r\nprimer of imaginary geography, giving to airy nothings a local\r\nhabitation and a name, and accompanying it with an atlas of maps in the\r\nmanner of the _Carte du Pays de Tendre_.\r\n\r\n(1894.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KINETOSCOPE OF TIME\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the twelfth stroke of the bell in the tower at the corner tolled\r\nforth slowly, the midnight wind blew chill down the deserted avenue,\r\nand swept it clear of all belated wayfarers. The bare trees in the thin\r\nstrip of park clashed their lifeless branches; the river far below\r\nslipped along silently. There was no moon, and the stars were shrouded.\r\nIt was a black night. Yet far in the distance there was a gleam of\r\ncheerful light which lured me on and on. I could not have said why it\r\nwas that I had ventured forth at that hour on such a night. It seemed\r\nto me as though the yellow glimmer I beheld afar off was the goal of my\r\nexcursion. Something within whispered to me then that I need go no\r\nfarther when once I had come to the spot whence the soft glare\r\nproceeded.\r\n\r\nThe pall of darkness was so dense that I could not see the sparse\r\nhouses I chanced to pass, nor did I know where I was any more. I urged\r\nforward blindly, walking towards the light, which was all that broke\r\nthe blackness before me; its faint illumination seemed to me somehow to\r\nbe kindly, inviting, irresistible. At last I came to a halt in front of\r\na building I had never before seen, although I thought myself well\r\nacquainted with that part of the city. It was a circular edifice, or so\r\nit seemed to me then; and I judged that it had but a single story, or\r\ntwo, at the most. The door stood open to the street; and it was from\r\nthis that the light was cast. So dim was this illumination now I had\r\ncome to it that I marvelled I could have seen it at all afar off as I\r\nwas when first I caught sight of it.\r\n\r\nWhile I stood at the portal of the unsuspected edifice, peering\r\ndoubtfully within, wondering to what end I had been led thither, and\r\nhesitating as to my next step, I felt again the impulse to go forward.\r\nAt that moment tiny darts of fire, as it were, glowed at the end of the\r\nhall that opened before me, and they ran together rapidly and joined in\r\nliquid lines and then faded as suddenly as they had come--but not too\r\nsoon for me to read the simple legend they had written in the air--an\r\ninvitation to me, so I interpreted it, to go forward again, to enter\r\nthe building, and to see for myself why I had been enticed there.\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation I obeyed. I walked through the doorway, and I became\r\nconscious that the door had closed behind me as I pressed forward. The\r\npassage was narrow and but faintly lighted; it bent to the right with a\r\ncircular sweep as though it skirted the inner circumference of the\r\nbuilding; still curving, it sank by a gentle gradient; and then it rose\r\nagain and turned almost at right angles. Pushing ahead resolutely,\r\nalthough in not a little doubt as to the meaning of my adventure, I\r\nthrust aside a heavy curtain, soft to the hand. Then I found myself\r\njust inside a large circular hall. Letting the hangings fall behind me,\r\nI took three or four irresolute paces which brought me almost to the\r\ncentre of the room. I saw that the walls were continuously draped with\r\nthe heavy folds of the same soft velvet, so that I could not even guess\r\nwhere it was I had entered. The rotunda was bare of all furniture;\r\nthere was no table in it, no chair, no sofa; nor was anything hanging\r\nfrom the ceiling or against the curtained walls. All that the room\r\ncontained was a set of four curiously shaped narrow stands, placed over\r\nagainst one another at the corners of what might be a square drawn\r\nwithin the circle of the hall. These narrow stands were close to the\r\ncurtains; they were perhaps a foot wide, each of them, or it might be a\r\nlittle more: they were twice or three times as long as they were wide;\r\nand they reached a height of possibly three or four feet.\r\n\r\nGoing towards one of these stands to examine it more curiously, I\r\ndiscovered that there were two projections from the top, resembling\r\neye-pieces, as though inviting the beholder to gaze into the inside of\r\nthe stand. Then I thought I heard a faint metallic click above my head.\r\nRaising my eyes swiftly, I read a few words written, as it were,\r\nagainst the dark velvet of the heavy curtains in dots of flame that\r\nflowed one into the other and melted away in a moment. When this\r\nmysterious legend had faded absolutely, I could not recall the words I\r\nhad read in the fitful and flitting letters of fire, and yet I retained\r\nthe meaning of the message; and I understood that if I chose to peer\r\nthrough the eye-pieces I should see a succession of strange dances.\r\n\r\nTo gaze upon dancing was not what I had gone forth to do, but I saw no\r\nreason why I should not do so, as I was thus strangely bidden. I\r\nlowered my head until my eyes were close to the two openings at the top\r\nof the stand. I looked into blackness at first, and yet I thought that\r\nI could detect a mystic commotion of the invisible particles at which I\r\nwas staring. I made no doubt that, if I waited, in due season the\r\npromise would be fulfilled. After a period of expectancy which I could\r\nnot measure, infinitesimal sparks darted hither and thither, and there\r\nwas a slight crackling sound. I concentrated my attention on what I was\r\nabout to see; and in a moment more I was rewarded.\r\n\r\nThe darkness took shape and robed itself in color; and there arose out\r\nof it a spacious banquet-hall, where many guests sat at supper. I could\r\nnot make out whether they were Romans or Orientals; the structure\r\nitself had a Latin solidity, but the decorations were Eastern in their\r\nglowing gorgeousness. The hall was illumined by hanging lamps, by the\r\nlight of which I tried to decide whether the ruler who sat in the seat\r\nof honor was a Roman or an Oriental. The beautiful woman beside him\r\nstruck me as Eastern beyond all question. While I gazed intently he\r\nturned to her and proffered a request. She smiled acquiescence, and\r\nthere was a flash of anticipated triumph in her eye as she beckoned to\r\na menial and sent him forth with a message. A movement as of expectancy\r\nran around the tables where the guests sat at meat. The attendants\r\nopened wide the portals and a young girl came forward. She was perhaps\r\nfourteen or fifteen years of age, but in the East women ripen young,\r\nand her beauty was indisputable. She had large, deep eyes and a full\r\nmouth; and there was a chain of silver and golden coins twisted into\r\nher coppery hair. She was so like to the woman who sat beside the ruler\r\nthat I did not doubt them to be mother and daughter. At a word from the\r\nelder the younger began to dance; and her dance was Oriental, slow at\r\nfirst, but holding every eye with its sensual fascination. The girl was\r\na mistress of the art; and not a man in the room withdrew his gaze from\r\nher till she made an end and stood motionless before the ruler. He said\r\na few words I could not hear, and then the daughter turned to the\r\nmother for guidance; and again I caught the flash of triumph in the\r\nelder woman's eye and on her face the suggestion of a hatred about to\r\nbe glutted. And then the light faded and the darkness settled down on\r\nthe scene and I saw no more.\r\n\r\nI did not raise my head from the stand, for I felt sure that this was\r\nnot all I was to behold; and in a few moments there was again a faint\r\nscintillation. In time the light was strong enough for me to perceive\r\nthe irregular flames of a huge bonfire burning in an old square of some\r\nmediaeval city. It was evening, and yet a throng of men and women and\r\nchildren made an oval about the fire and about a slim girl who had\r\nspread Persian carpet on the rough stones of the broad street. She was\r\na brunette, with dense black hair; she wore a striped skirt, and a\r\njacket braided with gold had slipped from her bare shoulders. She held\r\na tambourine in her hand and she was twisting and turning in cadence to\r\nher own song. Then she went to one side where stood a white goat with\r\ngilded horns and put down her tambourine and took up two swords; and\r\nwith these in her hands she resumed her dance. A man in the throng, a\r\nman of scant thirty-five, but already bald, a man of stalwart frame,\r\nfixed hot eyes upon her; and from time to time a smile and a sigh met\r\non his lips, but the smile was more dolorous than the sigh. And as the\r\ngypsy girl ceased her joyous gyrations, the bonfire died out, and\r\ndarkness fell on the scene again, and I could no longer see anything.\r\n\r\nAgain I waited, and after an interval no longer than the other there\r\ncame a faint glow that grew until I saw clearly as in the morning sun\r\nthe glade of a forest through which a brook rippled. A sad-faced woman\r\nsat on a stone by the side of the streamlet; her gray garments set off\r\nthe strange ornament in the fashion of a single letter of the alphabet\r\nthat was embroidered in gold and in scarlet over her heart. Visible at\r\nsome distance was a little girl, like a bright-apparelled vision, in a\r\nsunbeam, which fell down upon her through an arch of boughs. The ray\r\nquivered to and fro, making her figure dim or distinct, now like a real\r\nchild, now like a child's spirit, as the splendor came and went. With\r\nviolets and anemones and columbines the little girl had decorated her\r\nhair. The mother looked at the child and the child danced and sparkled\r\nand prattled airily along the course of the streamlet, which kept up a\r\nbabble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy. Then the mother raised\r\nher head as though her ears had detected the approach of some one\r\nthrough the wood. But before I could see who this newcomer might be,\r\nonce more the darkness settled down upon the scene.\r\n\r\nThis time I knew the interval between the succeeding visions and I\r\nwaited without impatience; and in due season I found myself gazing at a\r\npicture as different as might be from any I had yet beheld.\r\n\r\nIn the broad parlor of a house that seemed to be spacious, a\r\nmiddle-aged lady, of an appearance at once austere and kindly, was\r\nlooking at a smiling gentleman who was coming towards her pulling along\r\na little negro girl about eight or nine years of age. She was one of\r\nthe blackest of her race; and her round, shining eyes, glittering as\r\nglass beads, moved with quick and restless glances over everything in\r\nthe room. Her woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails, which\r\nstuck out in every direction. She was dressed in a single filthy,\r\nragged garment, made of bagging; and altogether there was something odd\r\nand goblin-like about her appearance. The severe old maid examined this\r\nstrange creature in dismay and then directed a glance of inquiry at the\r\ngentleman in white. He smiled again and gave a signal to the little\r\nnegro girl. Whereupon the black eyes glittered with a kind of wicked\r\ndrollery, and apparently she began to sing, keeping time with her hands\r\nand feet, spinning round, clapping her hands, knocking her knees\r\ntogether, in a wild, fantastic sort of time; and finally, turning a\r\nsomersault or two, she came suddenly down on the carpet, and stood with\r\nher hands folded, and a most sanctimonious expression of meekness and\r\nsolemnity over her face, only broken by the cunning glances which she\r\nshot askance from the corners of her eyes. The elderly lady stood\r\nsilent, perfectly paralyzed with amazement, while the smiling gentleman\r\nin white was amused at her astonishment.\r\n\r\nOnce more the vision faded. And when, after the same interval, the\r\ndarkness began to disappear again, even while everything was dim and\r\nindistinct I knew that the scene was shifted from the South to the\r\nNorth. I saw a room comfortably furnished, with a fire smouldering in a\r\nporcelain stove. In a corner stood a stripped Christmas-tree, with its\r\ncandles burned out. Against the wall between the two doors was a piano,\r\non which a man was playing--a man who twisted his head now and again to\r\nlook over his shoulder, sometimes at another and younger man standing\r\nby the stove, sometimes at a young woman who was dancing alone in the\r\ncentre of the room. This young woman had draped herself in a long\r\nparti-colored shawl and she held a tambourine in her hand. There was in\r\nher eyes a look of fear, as of one conscious of an impending\r\nmisfortune. As I gazed she danced more and more wildly. The man\r\nstanding by the porcelain stove was apparently making suggestions, to\r\nwhich she paid no heed. At last her hair broke loose and fell over her\r\nshoulders; and even this she did not notice, going on with her dancing\r\nas though it were a matter of life and death. Then one of the doors\r\nopened and another woman stood on the threshold. The man at the piano\r\nceased playing and left the instrument. The dancer paused unwillingly,\r\nand looked pleadingly up into the face of the younger man as he came\r\nforward and put his arm around her.\r\n\r\nAnd then once more the light died away and I found myself peering into\r\na void blackness. This time, though I waited long, there were no\r\ncrackling sparks announcing another inexplicable vision. I peered\r\nintently into the stand, but I saw nothing. At last I raised my head\r\nand looked about me. Then on the hangings over another of the four\r\nstands, over the one opposite to that into which I had been looking,\r\nthere appeared another message, the letters melting one into another in\r\nlines of liquid light; and this told me that in the other stand I\r\ncould, if I chose, gaze upon combats as memorable as the delectable\r\ndances I had been beholding.\r\n\r\nI made no hesitation, but crossed the room and took my place before the\r\nother stand and began at once to look through the projecting\r\neye-pieces. No sooner had I taken this position than the dots of fire\r\ndarted across the depth into which I was gazing; and then there came a\r\nfull clear light as of a cloudless sky, and I saw the walls of an\r\nancient city. At the gates of the city there stood a young man, and\r\ntoward him there ran a warrior, brandishing a spear, while the bronze\r\nof his helmet and his armor gleamed in the sunlight. And trembling\r\nseized the young man and he fled in fear; and the warrior darted after\r\nhim, trusting in his swift feet. Valiant was the flier, but far\r\nmightier he who fleetingly pursued him. At last the young man took\r\nheart and made a stand against the warrior. They faced each other in\r\nlight. The warrior hurled his spear and it went over the young man's\r\nhead. And the young man then hurled his spear in turn and it struck\r\nfair upon the centre of the warrior's shield. Then the young man drew\r\nhis sharp sword that by his flank hung great and strong. But by some\r\nmagic the warrior had recovered his spear; and as the young man came\r\nforward he hurled it again, and it drove through the neck of the young\r\nman at the joint of his armor, and he fell in the dust. After that the\r\nsun was darkened; and in a moment more I was looking into an empty\r\nblackness.\r\n\r\nWhen again the light returned it was once more with the full blaze of\r\nmid-day that the scene was illumined, and the glare of the sun was\r\nreflected from the burning sands of the desert. Two or three palms\r\narose near a well, and there two horsemen faced each other warily. One\r\nwas a Christian knight in a coat of linked mail, over which he wore a\r\nsurcoat of embroidered cloth, much frayed and bearing more than once\r\nthe arms of the wearer--a couchant leopard. The other was a Saracen,\r\nwho was circling swiftly about the knight of the leopard. The crusader\r\nsuddenly seized the mace which hung at his saddle-bow, and with a\r\nstrong hand and unerring aim sent it crashing against the head of his\r\nfoe, who raised his buckler of rhinoceros-hide in time to save his\r\nlife, though the force of the blow bore him from the saddle. The knight\r\nspurred his steed forward, but the Saracen leaped into his seat again\r\nwithout touching the stirrup. While the Christian recovered his mace,\r\nthe infidel withdrew to a little distance and strung the short bow he\r\ncarried at his back. Then he circled about his foe, whose armor stood\r\nhim in good stead, until the seventh shaft apparently found a less\r\nperfect part, and the Christian dropped heavily from his horse. But the\r\ndismounted Oriental found himself suddenly in the grasp of the\r\nEuropean, who had recourse to this artifice to bring his enemy within\r\nhis reach. The Saracen was saved again by his agility; and loosing his\r\nsword-belt, which the knight had grasped, he mounted his watching\r\nhorse. He had lost his sword and his arrows and his turban, and these\r\ndisadvantages seemed to incline him for a truce. He approached the\r\nChristian with his right hand extended, but no longer in a menacing\r\nattitude. What the result of this proffer of a parley might be I could\r\nnot observe, for the figures became indistinct, as though a cloud had\r\nsettled down on them; and in a few seconds more all was blank before\r\nme.\r\n\r\nWhen the next scene grew slowly into view I thought for a moment it\r\nmight be a continuation of the preceding, for the country I beheld was\r\nalso soaking in the hot sunlight of the South, and there was also a\r\nmounted knight in armor. A second glance undeceived me. This knight was\r\nold and thin and worn, and his armor was broken and pieced, and his\r\nhelmet was but a barber's basin, and his steed was a pitiful skeleton.\r\nHis countenance was sorrowful indeed, but there was that in his manner\r\nwhich would stop any man from denying his nobility. His eye was fired\r\nwith a high purpose and a lofty resolve. In the distance before him\r\nwere a group of windmills waving their arms in the air, and the knight\r\nurged forward his wretched horse as though to charge them. Upon an ass\r\nbehind him was a fellow of the baser sort, a genial, simple follower,\r\nseemingly serving him as his squire. As the knight pricked forward his\r\nsorry steed and couched his lance, the attendant apparently appealed to\r\nhim, and tried to explain, and even ventured on expostulation. But the\r\nknight gave no heed to the protests of the squire, who shook his head\r\nand dutifully followed his master. What the issue of this unequal\r\ncombat was to be I could not see, for the inexorable veil of darkness\r\nfell swiftly.\r\n\r\nEven after the stray sparks had again flitted through the blackness\r\ninto which I was gazing daylight did not return, and it was with\r\ndifficulty I was able at last to make out a vague street in a mediaeval\r\ncity doubtfully outlined by the hidden moon. From a window high above\r\nthe stones there came a faint glimmer. Under this window stood a\r\nsoldier worn with the wars, who carried himself as though glad now to\r\nbe at home again. He seemed to hear approaching feet, and he withdrew\r\ninto the shadow as two others advanced. One of these was a handsome\r\nyouth with an eager face, in which spirituality and sensuality\r\ncontended. The other was older, of an uncertain age, and his expression\r\nwas mocking and evil; he carried some sort of musical instrument, and\r\nto this he seemed to sing while the younger man looked up at the\r\nwindow. The soldier came forward angrily and dashed the instrument to\r\nthe ground with his sword. Then the newcomers drew also, and the elder\r\nguarded while the younger thrust. There were a few swift passes, and\r\nthen the younger of the two lunged fiercely, and the soldier fell back\r\non the stones wounded to the death. Without a glance behind them, the\r\ntwo who had withstood his onslaught withdrew, as the window above\r\nopened and a fair-haired girl leaned forth.\r\n\r\nThen nothing was visible, until after an interval the light once more\r\nreturned and I saw a sadder scene than any yet. In a hollow of the bare\r\nmountains a little knot of men in dark-blue uniforms were centred about\r\ntheir commander, whose long locks floated from beneath his broad hat.\r\nAround this small band of no more than a score of soldiers, thousands\r\nof red Indians were raging, with exultant hate in their eyes. The\r\nbodies of dead comrades lay in narrowing circles about the thinning\r\ngroup of blue-coats. The red men were picking off their few surviving\r\nfoes, one by one; and the white men could do nothing, for their\r\ncartridges were all gone. They stood at bay, valiant and defiant,\r\ndespite their many wounds; but the line of their implacable foemen was\r\ndrawn tighter and tighter about them, and one after another they fell\r\nforward dying or dead, until at last only the long-haired commander was\r\nleft, sore wounded but unconquered in spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen this picture of strong men facing death fearlessly was at last\r\ndissolved into darkness like the others that had gone before, I had an\r\ninward monition that it was the last that would be shown me; and so it\r\nwas, for although I kept my place at the stand for two or three minutes\r\nmore, no warning sparks dispersed the opaque depth.\r\n\r\nWhen I raised my head from the eye-pieces, I became conscious that I\r\nwas not alone. Almost in the centre of the circular hall stood a\r\nmiddle-aged man of distinguished appearance, whose eyes were fixed upon\r\nme. I wondered who he was, and whence he had come, and how he had\r\nentered, and what it might be that he wished with me. I caught a\r\nglimpse of a smile that lurked vaguely on his lips. Neither this smile\r\nnor the expression of his eyes was forbidding, though both were uncanny\r\nand inexplicable. He seemed to be conscious of a remoteness which would\r\nrender futile any effort of his towards friendliness.\r\n\r\nHow long we stood thus staring the one at the other I do not know. My\r\nheart beat heavily and my tongue refused to move when at last I tried\r\nto break the silence.\r\n\r\nThen he spoke, and his voice was low and strong and sweet.\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome,\" he began, and I noted that the accent was slightly\r\nforeign, Italian perhaps, or it might be French. \"I am glad always to\r\nshow the visions I have under my control to those who will appreciate\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nI tried to stammer forth a few words of thanks and of praise for what I\r\nhad seen.\r\n\r\n\"Did you recognize the strange scenes shown to you by these two\r\ninstruments?\" he asked, after bowing gently in acknowledgment of my\r\nawkward compliments.\r\n\r\nThen I plucked up courage and made bold to express to him the surprise\r\nI had felt, not only at the marvellous vividness with which the actions\r\nhad been repeated before my eyes, like life itself in form and in color\r\nand in motion, but also at the startling fact that some of the things I\r\nhad been shown were true and some were false. Some of them had happened\r\nactually to real men and women of flesh and blood, while others were\r\nbut bits of vain imagining of those who tell tales as an art and as a\r\nmeans of livelihood.\r\n\r\nI expressed myself as best I could, clumsily, no doubt; but he listened\r\npatiently and with the smile of toleration on his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"I understand your surprise that the facts and the\r\nfictions are mingled together in these visions of mine as though there\r\nwas little to choose between them. You are not the first to wonder or\r\nto express that wonder; and the rest of them were young like you. When\r\nyou are as old as I am--when you have lived as long as I--when you have\r\nseen as much of life as I--then you will know, as I know, that fact is\r\noften inferior to fiction, and that it is often also one and the same\r\nthing; for what might hare been is often quite as true as what actually\r\nwas?\"\r\n\r\nI did not know what to say in answer to this, and so I said nothing.\r\n\r\n\"What would you say to me,\" he went on--and now it seemed to me that\r\nhis smile suggested rather pitying condescension than kindly\r\ntoleration--\"what would you say to me, if I were to tell you that I\r\nmyself have seen all the many visions unrolled before you in these\r\ninstruments? What would you say, if I declared that I had gazed on the\r\ndances of Salome and of Esmeralda? that I had beheld the combat of\r\nAchilles and Hector and the mounted fight of Saladin and the Knight of\r\nthe Leopard?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not Time himself?\" I asked in amaze.\r\n\r\nHe laughed lightly, and without bitterness or mockery.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, promptly, \"I am not Time himself. And why should you\r\nthink so? Have I a scythe? Have I an hour-glass? Have I a forelock? Do\r\nI look so very old, then?\"\r\n\r\nI examined him more carefully to answer this last question, and the\r\nmore I scrutinized him the more difficult I found it to declare his\r\nage. At first I had thought him to be forty, perhaps, or of a certainty\r\nless than fifty. But now, though his hair was black, though his eye was\r\nbright, though his step was firm, though his gestures were free and\r\nsweeping, I had my doubts; and I thought I could perceive, one after\r\nanother, many impalpable signs of extreme old age.\r\n\r\nThen, all at once, he grew restive under my fixed gaze.\r\n\r\n\"But it is not about me that we need to waste time now,\" he said,\r\nimpatiently. \"You have seen what two of my instruments contain; would\r\nyou like now to examine the contents of the other two?\"\r\n\r\nI answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"The two you have looked into are gratuitous,\" he continued. \"For what\r\nyou beheld in them there is no charge. But a sight of the visions in\r\nthe other two or in either one of them must be paid for. So far, you\r\nare welcome as my guest; but if you wish to see any more you must pay\r\nthe price.\"\r\n\r\nI asked what the charge was, as I thrust my hand into my pocket to be\r\ncertain that I had my purse with me.\r\n\r\nHe saw my gesture, and he smiled once more.\r\n\r\n\"The visions I can set before you in those two instruments you have not\r\nyet looked into are visions of your own life,\" he said. \"In that stand\r\nthere,\" and he indicated one behind my back, \"you can see five of the\r\nmost important episodes of your past.\"\r\n\r\nI withdrew my hand from my pocket. \"I thank you,\" I said, \"but I know\r\nmy own past, and I have no wish to see it again, however cheap the\r\nspectacle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will be more interested in the fourth of my instruments,\" he\r\nsaid, as he waved his thin, delicate hand towards the stand which stood\r\nin front of me. \"In this you can see your future!\"\r\n\r\nI made an involuntary step forward; and then, at a second thought, I\r\nshrank back again.\r\n\r\n\"The price of this is not high,\" he continued, \"and it is not payable\r\nin money.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, then, should I buy it?\" I asked, doubtingly.\r\n\r\n\"In life!\" he answered, gravely. \"The vision of life must be paid for\r\nin life itself. For every ten years of the future which I may unroll\r\nbefore you here, you must assign me a year of life--twelve months--to\r\ndo with as I will.\"\r\n\r\nStrange as it seems to me now, I did not doubt that he could do as he\r\ndeclared. I hesitated, and then I fixed my resolve.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" I said, and I saw that he was awaiting my decision\r\neagerly. \"Thank you again for what I have already seen and for what you\r\nproffer me. But my past I have lived once, and there is no need to turn\r\nover again the leaves of that dead record. And the future I must face\r\nas best I may, the more bravely, I think, that I do not know what it\r\nholds in store for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The price is low,\" he urged.\r\n\r\n\"It must be lower still,\" I answered; \"it might be nothing at all, and\r\nI should still decline. I cannot afford to be impatient now and to\r\nborrow knowledge of the future. I shall know all in good time.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed not a little disappointed as I said this.\r\n\r\nThen he made a final appeal: \"Would you not wish to know even the\r\nmatter of your end?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I answered. \"That is no temptation to me, for whatever it may be\r\nI must find fortitude to undergo it somehow, whether I am to pass away\r\nin my sleep in my bed, or whether I shall have to withstand the chances\r\nof battle and murder and sudden death.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is your last word?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you again for what I have seen,\" I responded, bowing again;\r\n\"but my decision is final.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will detain you no longer,\" he said, haughtily, and he walked\r\ntowards the circling curtains and swept two of them aside. They draped\r\nthemselves back, and I saw before me an opening like that through which\r\nI had entered.\r\n\r\nI followed him, and the curtains dropped behind me as I passed into the\r\ninsufficiently illuminated passage beyond. I thought that the\r\nmysterious being with whom I had been conversing had preceded me, but\r\nbefore I had gone twenty paces I found that I was alone. I pushed\r\nahead, and my path twisted and turned on itself and rose and fell\r\nirregularly like that by means of which I had made my way into the\r\nunknown edifice. At last I picked my steps down winding stairs, and at\r\nthe foot I saw the outline of a door. I pushed it back, and I found\r\nmyself in the open air.\r\n\r\nI was in a broad street, and over my head an electric light suddenly\r\nflared out and white-washed the pavement at my feet. At the corner a\r\ntrain of the elevated railroad rushed by with a clattering roar and a\r\ntrailing plume of white steam. Then a cable-car clanged past with\r\nincessant bangs upon its gong. Thus it was that I came back to the\r\nworld of actuality.\r\n\r\nI turned to get my bearings, that I might find my way home again. I was\r\nstanding almost in front of a shop, the windows of which were filled\r\nwith framed engravings.\r\n\r\nOne of these caught my eye, and I confess that I was surprised. It was\r\na portrait of a man--it was a portrait of the man with whom I had been\r\ntalking.\r\n\r\nI went close to the window, that I might see it better. The electric\r\nlight emphasized the lines of the high-bred face, with its sombre\r\nsearching eyes and the air of old-world breeding. There could be no\r\ndoubt whatever that the original of this portrait was the man from whom\r\nI had just parted. By the costume I knew that the original had lived in\r\nthe last century; and the legend beneath the head, engraved in a\r\nflowing script, asserted this to be a likeness of \"_Monsieur le Comte\r\nde Cagliostro_.\"\r\n\r\n(1895.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DREAM-GOWN OF THE JAPANESE AMBASSADOR\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAfter arranging the Egyptian and Mexican pottery so as to contrast\r\nagreeably with the Dutch and the German beer-mugs on the top of the\r\nbookcase that ran along one wall of the sitting-room, Cosmo Waynflete\r\nwent back into the bedroom and took from a half-empty trunk the little\r\ncardboard boxes in which he kept the collection of playing-cards, and\r\nof all manner of outlandish equivalents for these simple instruments of\r\nfortune, picked up here and there during his two or three years of\r\ndilettante travelling in strange countries. At the same time he brought\r\nout a Japanese crystal ball, which he stood upon its silver tripod,\r\nplacing it on a little table in one of the windows on each side of the\r\nfireplace; and there the rays of the westering sun lighted it up at\r\nonce into translucent loveliness.\r\n\r\nThe returned wanderer looked out of the window and saw on one side the\r\ngraceful and vigorous tower of the Madison Square Garden, with its\r\nDiana turning in the December wind, while in the other direction he\r\ncould look down on the frozen paths of Union Square, only a block\r\ndistant, but as far below him almost as though he were gazing down from\r\na balloon. Then he stepped back into the sitting-room itself, and noted\r\nthe comfortable furniture and wood-fire crackling in friendly fashion\r\non the hearth, and his own personal belongings, scattered here and\r\nthere as though they were settling themselves for a stay. Having\r\narrived from Europe only that morning, he could not but hold himself\r\nlucky to have found these rooms taken for him by the old friend to whom\r\nhe had announced his return, and with whom he was to eat his Christmas\r\ndinner that evening. He had not been on shore more than six or seven\r\nhours, and yet the most of his odds and ends were unpacked and already\r\nin place as though they belonged in this new abode. It was true that he\r\nhad toiled unceasingly to accomplish this, and as he stood there in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, admiring the results of his labors, he was conscious\r\nalso that his muscles were fatigued, and that the easy-chair before the\r\nfire opened its arms temptingly.\r\n\r\nHe went again into the bedroom, and took from one of his many trunks a\r\nlong, loose garment of pale-gray silk. Apparently this beautiful robe\r\nwas intended to serve as a dressing-gown, and as such Cosmo Waynflete\r\nutilized it immediately. The ample folds fell softly about him, and the\r\nrich silk itself seemed to be soothing to his limbs, so delicate was\r\nits fibre and so carefully had it been woven. Around the full skirt\r\nthere was embroidery of threads of gold, and again on the open and\r\nflowing sleeves. With the skilful freedom of Japanese art the pattern\r\nof this decoration seemed to suggest the shrubbery about a spring, for\r\nthere were strange plants with huge leaves broadly outlined by the\r\ngolden threads, and in the midst of them water was seen bubbling from\r\nthe earth and lapping gently over the edge of the fountain. As the\r\nreturned wanderer thrust his arms into the dressing-gown with its\r\nsymbolic embroidery on the skirt and sleeves, he remembered distinctly\r\nthe dismal day when he had bought it in a little curiosity-shop in\r\nNuremberg; and as he fastened across his chest one by one the loops of\r\nsilken cord to the three coins which served as buttons down the front\r\nof the robe, he recalled also the time and the place where he had\r\npicked up each of these pieces of gold and silver, one after another.\r\nThe first of them was a Persian daric, which he had purchased from a\r\ndealer on the Grand Canal in Venice; and the second was a Spanish peso\r\nstruck under Philip II. at Potosi, which he had found in a stall on the\r\nembankment of the Quay Voltaire, in Paris; and the third was a York\r\nshilling, which he had bought from the man who had turned it up in\r\nploughing a field that sloped to the Hudson near Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nHaving thus wrapped himself in this unusual dressing-gown with its\r\nunexpected buttons of gold and silver, Cosmo Waynflete went back into\r\nthe front room. He dropped into the arm-chair before the fire. It was\r\nwith a smile of physical satisfaction that he stretched out his feet to\r\nthe hickory blaze.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was drawing on, and in New York the sun sets early on\r\nChristmas day. The red rays shot into the window almost horizontally,\r\nand they filled the crystal globe with a curious light. Cosmo Waynflete\r\nlay back in his easy-chair, with his Japanese robe about him, and gazed\r\nintently at the beautiful ball which seemed like a bubble of air and\r\nwater. His mind went back to the afternoon in April, two years before,\r\nwhen he had found that crystal sphere in a Japanese shop within sight\r\nof the incomparable Fugiyama.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAs he peered into its transparent depths, with his vision focused upon\r\nthe spot of light where the rays of the setting sun touched it into\r\nflame, he was but little surprised to discover that he could make out\r\ntiny figures in the crystal. For the moment this strange thing seemed\r\nto him perfectly natural. And the movements of these little men and\r\nwomen interested him so much that he watched them as they went to and\r\nfro, sweeping a roadway with large brooms. Thus it happened that the\r\nfixity of his gaze was intensified. And so it was that in a few minutes\r\nhe saw with no astonishment that he was one of the group himself, he\r\nhimself in the rich and stately attire of a samurai. From the instant\r\nthat Cosmo Waynflete discovered himself among the people whom he saw\r\nmoving before him, as his eyes were fastened on the illuminated dot in\r\nthe transparent ball, he ceased to see them as little figures, and he\r\naccepted them as of the full stature of man. This increase in their\r\nsize was no more a source of wonderment to him than it had been to\r\ndiscern himself in the midst of them. He accepted both of these\r\nmarvellous things without question--indeed, with no thought at all that\r\nthey were in any way peculiar or abnormal. Not only this, but\r\nthereafter he seemed to have transferred his personality to the Cosmo\r\nWaynflete who was a Japanese samurai and to have abandoned entirely the\r\nCosmo Waynflete who was an American traveller, and who had just\r\nreturned to New York that Christmas morning. So completely did the\r\nJapanese identity dominate that the existence of the American identity\r\nwas wholly unknown to him. It was as though the American had gone to\r\nsleep in New York at the end of the nineteenth century, and had waked a\r\nJapanese in Nippon in the beginning of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nWith his sword by his side--a Murimasa blade, likely to bring bad luck\r\nto the wearer sooner or later--he had walked from his own house in the\r\nquarter of Kioto which is called Yamashina to the quarter which is\r\ncalled Yoshiwara, a place of ill repute, where dwell women of evil\r\nlife, and where roysterers and drunkards come by night. He knew that\r\nthe sacred duty of avenging his master's death had led him to cast off\r\nhis faithful wife so that he might pretend to riot in debauchery at the\r\nThree Sea-Shores. The fame of his shameful doings had spread abroad,\r\nand it must soon come to the ears of the man whom he wished to take\r\nunawares. Now he was lying prone in the street, seemingly sunk in a\r\ndrunken slumber, so that men might see him and carry the news to the\r\ntreacherous assassin of his beloved master. As he lay there that\r\nafternoon, he revolved in his mind the devices he should use to make\r\naway with his enemy when the hour might be ripe at last for the\r\naccomplishment of his holy revenge. To himself he called the roll of\r\nhis fellow-ronins, now biding their time, as he was, and ready always\r\nto obey his orders and to follow his lead to the death, when at last\r\nthe sun should rise on the day of vengeance.\r\n\r\nSo he gave no heed to the scoffs and the jeers of those who passed\r\nalong the street, laughing him to scorn as they beheld him lying there\r\nin a stupor from excessive drink at that inordinate hour of the day.\r\nAnd among those who came by at last was a man from Satsuma, who was\r\nmoved to voice the reproaches of all that saw this sorry sight.\r\n\r\n\"Is not this Oishi Kuranosuke,\" said the man from Satsuma, \"who was a\r\ncouncillor of Asano Takumi no Kami, and who, not having the heart to\r\navenge his lord, gives himself up to women and wine? See how he lies\r\ndrunk in the public street! Faithless beast! Fool and craven! Unworthy\r\nof the name of a samurai!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that the man from Satsuma trod on him as he lay there, and\r\nspat upon him, and went away indignantly. The spies of Kotsuke no Suke\r\nheard what the man from Satsuma had said, and they saw how he had\r\nspurned the prostrate samurai with his foot; and they went their way to\r\nreport to their master that he need no longer have any fear of the\r\ncouncillors of Asano Takumi no Kami. All this the man, lying prone in\r\nthe dust of the street, noted; and it made his heart glad, for then he\r\nmade sure that the day was soon coming when he could do his duty at\r\nlast and take vengeance for the death of his master.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nHe lay there longer than he knew, and the twilight settled down at\r\nlast, and the evening stars came out. And then, after a while, and by\r\nimperceptible degrees, Cosmo Waynflete became conscious that the scene\r\nhad changed and that he had changed with it. He was no longer in Japan,\r\nbut in Persia. He was no longer lying like a drunkard in the street of\r\na city, but slumbering like a weary soldier in a little oasis by the\r\nside of a spring in the midst of a sandy desert. He was asleep, and his\r\nfaithful horse was unbridled that it might crop the grass at will.\r\n\r\nThe air was hot and thick, and the leaves of the slim tree above him\r\nwere never stirred by a wandering wind. Yet now and again there came\r\nfrom the darkness a faintly fetid odor. The evening wore on and still\r\nhe slept, until at length in the silence of the night a strange huge\r\ncreature wormed its way steadily out of its lair amid the trees, and\r\ndrew near the sleeping man to devour him fiercely. But the horse\r\nneighed vehemently and beat the ground with his hoofs and waked his\r\nmaster. Then the hideous monster vanished; and the man, aroused from\r\nhis sleep, saw nothing, although the evil smell still lingered in the\r\nsultry atmosphere. He lay down again once more, thinking that for once\r\nhis steed had given a false alarm. Again the grisly dragon drew nigh,\r\nand again the courser notified its rider, and again the man could make\r\nout nothing in the darkness of the night; and again he was wellnigh\r\nstifled by the foul emanation that trailed in the wake of the\r\nmisbegotten creature. He rebuked his horse and laid him down once more.\r\n\r\nA third time the dreadful beast approached, and a third time the\r\nfaithful charger awoke its angry master. But there came the breath of a\r\ngentle breeze, so that the man did not fear to fill his lungs; and\r\nthere was a vague light in the heavens now, so that he could dimly\r\ndiscern his mighty enemy; and at once he girded himself for the fight.\r\nThe scaly monster came full at him with dripping fangs, its mighty body\r\nthrusting forward its huge and hideous head. The man met the attack\r\nwithout fear and smote the beast full on the crest, but the blow\r\nrebounded from its coat of mail.\r\n\r\nThen the faithful horse sprang forward and bit the dreadful creature\r\nfull upon the neck and tore away the scales, so that its master's sword\r\ncould pierce the armored hide. So the man was able to dissever the\r\nghastly head and thus to slay the monstrous dragon. The blackness of\r\nnight wrapped him about once more as he fell on his knees and gave\r\nthanks for his victory; and the wind died away again.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOnly a few minutes later, so it seemed to him, Cosmo Waynflete became\r\ndoubtfully aware of another change of time and place--of another\r\ntransformation of his own being. He knew himself to be alone once more,\r\nand even without his trusty charger. Again he found himself groping in\r\nthe dark. But in a little while there was a faint radiance of light,\r\nand at last the moon came out behind a tower. Then he saw that he was\r\nnot by the roadside in Japan or in the desert of Persia, but now in\r\nsome unknown city of Southern Europe, where the architecture was\r\nhispano-moresque. By the silver rays of the moon he was able to make\r\nout the beautiful design damascened upon the blade of the sword which\r\nhe held now in his hand ready drawn for self-defence.\r\n\r\nThen he heard hurried footfalls down the empty street, and a man rushed\r\naround the corner pursued by two others, who had also weapons in their\r\nhands. For a moment Cosmo Waynflete was a Spaniard, and to him it was a\r\npoint of honor to aid the weaker party. He cried to the fugitive to\r\npluck up heart and to withstand the enemy stoutly. But the hunted man\r\nfled on, and after him went one of the pursuers, a tall, thin fellow,\r\nwith a long black cloak streaming behind him as he ran.\r\n\r\nThe other of the two, a handsome lad with fair hair, came to a halt and\r\ncrossed swords with Cosmo, and soon showed himself to be skilled in the\r\nart of fence. So violent was the young fellow's attack that in the\r\nardor of self-defence Cosmo ran the boy through the body before he had\r\ntime to hold his hand or even to reflect.\r\n\r\nThe lad toppled over sideways. \"Oh, my mother!\" he cried, and in a\r\nsecond he was dead. While Cosmo bent over the body, hasty footsteps\r\nagain echoed along the silent thoroughfare. Cosmo peered around the\r\ncorner, and by the struggling moonbeams he could see that it was the\r\ntall, thin fellow in the black cloak, who was returning with half a\r\nscore of retainers, all armed, and some of them bearing torches.\r\n\r\nCosmo turned and fled swiftly, but being a stranger in the city he soon\r\nlost himself in its tortuous streets. Seeing a light in a window and\r\nobserving a vine that trailed from the balcony before it, he climbed up\r\nboldly, and found himself face to face with a gray-haired lady, whose\r\nvisage was beautiful and kindly and noble. In a few words he told her\r\nhis plight and besought sanctuary. She listened to him in silence, with\r\nexceeding courtesy of manner, as though she were weighing his words\r\nbefore making up her mind. She raised the lamp on her table and let its\r\nbeams fall on his lineaments. And still she made no answer to his\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nThen came a glare of torches in the street below and a knocking at the\r\ndoor. Then at last the old lady came to a resolution; she lifted the\r\ntapestry at the head of her bed and told him to bestow himself there.\r\nNo sooner was he hidden than the tall, thin man in the long black cloak\r\nentered hastily. He greeted the elderly lady as his aunt, and he told\r\nher that her son had been set upon by a stranger in the street and had\r\nbeen slain. She gave a great cry and never took her eyes from his face.\r\nThen he said that a servant had seen an unknown man climb to the\r\nbalcony of her house. What if it were the assassin of her son? The\r\nblood left her face and she clutched at the table behind her, as she\r\ngave orders to have the house searched.\r\n\r\nWhen the room was empty at last she went to the head of the bed and\r\nbade the man concealed there to come forth and begone, but to cover his\r\nface, that she might not be forced to know him again. So saying, she\r\ndropped on her knees before a crucifix, while he slipped out of the\r\nwindow again and down to the deserted street.\r\n\r\nHe sped to the corner and turned it undiscovered, and breathed a sigh\r\nof relief and of regret. He kept on steadily, gliding stealthily along\r\nin the shadows, until he found himself at the city gate as the bell of\r\nthe cathedral tolled the hour of midnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nHow it was that he passed through the gate he could not declare with\r\nprecision, for seemingly a mist had settled about him. Yet a few\r\nminutes later he saw that in some fashion he must have got beyond the\r\nwalls of the town, for he recognized the open country all around. And,\r\noddly enough, he now discovered himself to be astride a bony steed. He\r\ncould not say what manner of horse it was he was riding, but he felt\r\nsure that it was not the faithful charger that had saved his life in\r\nPersia, once upon a time, in days long gone by, as it seemed to him\r\nthen. He was not in Persia now--of that he was certain, nor in Japan,\r\nnor in the Iberian peninsula. Where he was he did not know.\r\n\r\nIn the dead hush of midnight he could hear the barking of a dog on the\r\nopposite shore of a dusky and indistinct waste of waters that spread\r\nitself far below him. The night grew darker and darker, the stars\r\nseemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid\r\nthem from his sight. He had never felt so lonely and dismal. In the\r\ncentre of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree; its limbs were gnarled\r\nand fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees, twisting\r\ndown almost to the earth, and rising again into the air. As he\r\napproached this fearful tree he thought he saw something white hanging\r\nin the midst of it, but on looking more narrowly he perceived it was a\r\nplace where it had been scathed by lightning and the white wood laid\r\nbare. About two hundred yards from the tree a small brook crossed the\r\nroad; and as he drew near he beheld--on the margin of this brook, and\r\nin the dark shadow of the grove--he beheld something huge, misshapen,\r\nblack, and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the\r\ngloom like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.\r\n\r\nHe demanded, in stammering accents, \"Who are you?\" He received no\r\nreply. He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice. Still\r\nthere was no answer. And then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in\r\nmotion, and with a scramble and a bound stood in the middle of the\r\nroad. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions and mounted on a\r\nblack horse of powerful frame. Having no relish for this strange\r\nmidnight companion, Cosmo Waynflete urged on his steed in hopes of\r\nleaving the apparition behind; but the stranger quickened his horse\r\nalso to an equal pace. And when the first horseman pulled up, thinking\r\nto lag behind, the second did likewise. There was something in the\r\nmoody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was\r\nmysterious and appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On\r\nmounting a rising ground which brought the figure of his\r\nfellow-traveller against the sky, gigantic in height and muffled in a\r\ncloak, he was horror-struck to discover the stranger was headless!--but\r\nhis horror was still more increased in observing that the head which\r\nshould have rested on the shoulders was carried before the body on the\r\npommel of the saddle.\r\n\r\nThe terror of Cosmo Waynflete rose to desperation, and he spurred his\r\nsteed suddenly in the hope of giving his weird companion the slip. But\r\nthe headless horseman started full jump with him. His own horse, as\r\nthough possessed by a demon, plunged headlong down the hill. He could\r\nhear, however, the black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he\r\neven fancied that he felt the hot breath of the pursuer. When he\r\nventured at last to cast a look behind, he saw the goblin rising in the\r\nstirrups, and in the very act of hurling at him the grisly head. He\r\nfell out of the saddle to the ground; and the black steed and the\r\ngoblin rider passed by him like a whirlwind.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nHow long he lay there by the roadside, stunned and motionless, he could\r\nnot guess; but when he came to himself at last the sun was already high\r\nin the heavens. He discovered himself to be reclining on the tall grass\r\nof a pleasant graveyard which surrounded a tiny country church in the\r\noutskirts of a pretty little village. It was in the early summer, and\r\nthe foliage was green above him as the boughs swayed gently to and fro\r\nin the morning breeze. The birds were singing gayly as they flitted\r\nabout over his head. The bees hummed along from flower to flower. At\r\nlast, so it seemed to him, he had come into a land of peace and quiet,\r\nwhere there was rest and comfort and where no man need go in fear of\r\nhis life. It was a country where vengeance was not a duty and where\r\nmidnight combats were not a custom he found himself smiling as he\r\nthought that a grisly dragon and a goblin rider would be equally out of\r\nplace in this laughing landscape.\r\n\r\nThen the bell in the steeple of the little church began to ring\r\nmerrily, and he rose to his feet in expectation. All of a sudden the\r\nknowledge came to him why it was that they were ringing. He wondered\r\nthen why the coming of the bride was thus delayed. He knew himself to\r\nbe a lover, with life opening brightly before him; and the world seemed\r\nto him sweeter than ever before and more beautiful.\r\n\r\nThen at last the girl whom he loved with his whole heart and who had\r\npromised to marry him appeared in the distance, and he thought he had\r\nnever seen her look more lovely. As he beheld his bridal party\r\napproaching, he slipped into the church to await her at the altar. The\r\nsunshine fell full upon the portal and made a halo about the girl's\r\nhead as she crossed the threshold.\r\n\r\nBut even when the bride stood by his side and the clergyman had begun\r\nthe solemn service of the church the bells kept on, and soon their\r\nchiming became a clangor, louder and sharper and more insistent.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSo clamorous and so persistent was the ringing that Cosmo Waynflete was\r\nroused at last. He found himself suddenly standing on his feet, with\r\nhis hand clutching the back of the chair in which he had been sitting\r\nbefore the fire when the rays of the setting sun had set long ago. The\r\nroom was dark, for it was lighted now only by the embers of the\r\nburnt-out fire; and the electric bell was ringing steadily, as though\r\nthe man outside the door had resolved to waken the seven sleepers.\r\n\r\nThen Cosmo Waynflete was wide-awake again; and he knew where he was\r\nonce more--not in Japan, not in Persia, not in Lisbon, not in Sleepy\r\nHollow, but here in New York, in his own room, before his own fire. He\r\nopened the door at once and admitted his friend, Paul Stuyvesant.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't dinner-time, is it?\" he asked. \"I'm not late, am I? The fact\r\nis, I've been asleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so good of you to confess that,\" his friend answered, laughing;\r\n\"although the length of time you kept me waiting and ringing might have\r\nled me to suspect it. No, you are not late and it is not dinner-time.\r\nI've come around to have another little chat with you before dinner,\r\nthat's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take this chair, old man,\" said Cosmo, as he threw another\r\nhickory-stick on the fire. Then he lighted the gas and sat down by the\r\nside of his friend.\r\n\r\n\"This chair is comfortable, for a fact,\" Stuyvesant declared,\r\nstretching himself out luxuriously. \"No wonder you went to sleep. What\r\ndid you dream of?--strange places you had seen in your travels or the\r\nhomely scenes of your native land.\"\r\n\r\nWaynflete looked at his friend for a moment without answering the\r\nquestion. He was startled as he recalled the extraordinary series of\r\nadventures which had fallen to his lot since he had fixed his gaze on\r\nthe crystal ball. It seemed to him as though he had been whirled\r\nthrough space and through time.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose every man is always the hero of his own dreams,\" he began,\r\ndoubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" his friend returned; \"in sleep our natural and healthy\r\negotism is absolutely unrestrained. It doesn't make any matter where\r\nthe scene is laid or whether the play is a comedy or a tragedy, the\r\ndreamer has always the centre of the stage, with the calcium light\r\nturned full on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just it,\" Waynflete went on; \"this dream of mine makes me feel\r\nas if I were an actor, and as if I had been playing many parts, one\r\nafter the other, in the swiftest succession. They are not familiar to\r\nme, and yet I confess to a vague feeling of unoriginality. It is as\r\nthough I were a plagiarist of adventure--if that be a possible\r\nsupposition. I have just gone through these startling situations\r\nmyself, and yet I'm sure that they have all of them happened\r\nbefore--although, perhaps, not to any one man. Indeed, no one man could\r\nhave had all these adventures of mine, because I see now that I have\r\nbeen whisked through the centuries and across the hemispheres with a\r\nsuddenness possible only in dreams. Yet all my experiences seem somehow\r\nsecond-hand, and not really my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Picked up here and there--like your bric-a-brac?\" suggested\r\nStuyvesant. \"But what are these alluring adventures of yours that\r\nstretched through the ages and across the continents?\"\r\n\r\nThen, knowing how fond his friend was of solving mysteries and how\r\nproud he was of his skill in this art, Cosmo Waynflete narrated his\r\ndream as it has been set down in these pages.\r\n\r\nWhen he had made an end, Paul Stuyvesant's first remark was: \"I'm sorry\r\nI happened along just then and waked you up before you had time to get\r\nmarried.\"\r\n\r\nHis second remark followed half a minute later.\r\n\r\n\"I see how it was,\" he said; \"you were sitting in this chair and\r\nlooking at that crystal ball, which focussed the level rays of the\r\nsetting sun, I suppose? Then it is plain enough--you hypnotized\r\nyourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard that such a thing is possible,\" responded Cosmo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possible?\" Stuyvesant returned, \"it is certain! But what is more\r\ncurious is the new way in which you combined your self-hypnotism with\r\ncrystal-gazing. You have heard of scrying, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the practice of looking into a drop of water or a crystal\r\nball or anything of that sort,\" said Cosmo, \"and of seeing things in\r\nit--of seeing people moving about?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I do mean,\" his friend returned. \"And that's just\r\nwhat you have been doing. You fixed your gaze on the ball, and so\r\nhypnotized yourself; and then, in the intensity of your vision, you\r\nwere able to see figures in the crystal--with one of which visualized\r\nemanations you immediately identified yourself. That's easy enough, I\r\nthink. But I don't see what suggested to you your separate experiences.\r\nI recognize them, of course----\"\r\n\r\n\"You recognize them?\" cried Waynflete, in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"I can tell you where you borrowed every one of your adventures,\"\r\nStuyvesant replied, \"But what I'd like to know now is what suggested to\r\nyou just those particular characters and situations, and not any of the\r\nmany others also stored away in your subconsciousness.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he began to look about the room.\r\n\r\n\"My subconsciousness?\" repeated Waynflete. \"Have I ever been a samurai\r\nin my subconsciousness?\"\r\n\r\nPaul Stuyvesant looked at Cosmo Waynflete for nearly a minute without\r\nreply. Then all the answer he made was to say: \"That's a queer\r\ndressing-gown you have on.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is time I took it off,\" said the other, as he twisted himself out\r\nof its clinging folds. \"It is a beautiful specimen of weaving, isn't\r\nit? I call it the dream-gown of the Japanese ambassador, for although I\r\nbought it in a curiosity-shop in Nuremberg, it was once, I really\r\nbelieve, the slumber-robe of an Oriental envoy.\"\r\n\r\nStuyvesant took the silken garment from his friend's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Why did the Japanese ambassador sell you his dream-gown in a Nuremberg\r\ncuriosity-shop?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't,\" Waynflete explained. \"I never saw the ambassador, and\r\nneither did the old German lady who kept the shop. She told me she\r\nbought it from a Japanese acrobat who was out of an engagement and\r\ndesperately hard up. But she told me also that the acrobat had told her\r\nthat the garment had belonged to an ambassador who had given it to him\r\nas a reward of his skill, and that he never would have parted with it\r\nif he had not been dead-broke.\"\r\n\r\nStuyvesant held the robe up to the light and inspected the embroidery\r\non the skirt of it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, at last, \"this would account for it, I suppose. This\r\nbit here was probably meant to suggest 'the well where the head was\r\nwashed,'--see?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that those lines may be meant to represent the outline of a\r\nspring of water, but I don't see what that has to do with my dream,\"\r\nWaynflete answered.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you?\" Stuyvesant returned. \"Then I'll show you. You had on this\r\nsilk garment embroidered here with an outline of the well in which was\r\nwashed the head of Kotsuke no Suke, the man whom the Forty-Seven Ronins\r\nkilled. You know the story?\"\r\n\r\n\"I read it in Japan, but----\" began Cosmo.\r\n\r\n\"You had that story stored away in your subconsciousness,\" interrupted\r\nhis friend. \"And when you hypnotized yourself by peering into the\r\ncrystal ball, this embroidery it was which suggested to you to see\r\nyourself as the hero of the tale--Oishi Kuranosuke, the chief of the\r\nForty-Seven Ronins, the faithful follower who avenged his master by\r\npretending to be vicious and dissipated--just like Brutus and\r\nLorenzaccio--until the enemy was off his guard and open to attack.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I do recall the tale of the Forty-Seven Ronins, but only very\r\nvaguely,\" said the hero of the dream. \"For all I know I may have had\r\nthe adventure of Oishi Kuranosuke laid on the shelf somewhere in my\r\nsubconsciousness, as you want me to believe. But how about my Persian\r\ndragon and my Iberian noblewoman?\"\r\n\r\nPaul Stuyvesant was examining the dream-gown of the Japanese ambassador\r\nwith minute care. Suddenly he said, \"Oh!\" and then he looked up at\r\nCosmo Waynflete and asked: \"What are those buttons? They seem to be old\r\ncoins.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are old coins,\" the other answered; \"it was a fancy of mine to\r\nutilize them on that Japanese dressing-gown. They are all different,\r\nyou see. The first is----\"\r\n\r\n\"Persian, isn't it?\" interrupted Stuyvesant.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Waynflete explained, \"it is a Persian daric. And the second is a\r\nSpanish peso made at Potosi under Philip II. for use in America. And\r\nthe third is a York shilling, one of the coins in circulation here in\r\nNew York at the time of the Revolution--I got that one, in fact, from\r\nthe farmer who ploughed it up in a field at Tarrytown, near Sunnyside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then there are three of your adventures accounted for, Cosmo, and\r\neasily enough,\" Paul commented, with obvious satisfaction at his own\r\nexplanation. \"Just as the embroidery on the silk here suggested to\r\nyou--after you had hypnotized yourself--that you were the chief of the\r\nForty-Seven Ronins, so this first coin here in turn suggested to you\r\nthat you were Rustem, the hero of the 'Epic of Kings.' You have read\r\nthe 'Shah-Nameh?'\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember Firdausi's poem after a fashion only,\" Cosmo answered. \"Was\r\nnot Rustem a Persian Hercules, so to speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it precisely,\" the other responded, \"and he had seven labors to\r\nperform; and you dreamed the third of them, the slaying of the grisly\r\ndragon. For my own part, I think I should have preferred the fourth of\r\nthem, the meeting with the lovely enchantress; but that's neither here\r\nnor there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me I do recollect something about that fight of Rustem and\r\nthe strange beast. The faithful horse's name was Rakush, wasn't it?\"\r\nasked Waynflete.\r\n\r\n\"If you can recollect the 'Shah-Nameh,'\" Stuyvesant pursued, \"no doubt\r\nyou can recall also Beaumont and Fletcher's 'Custom of the Country?'\r\nThat's where you got the midnight duel in Lisbon and the magnanimous\r\nmother, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't know,\" the other declared.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you did, for all that,\" Paul went on. \"The situation is taken\r\nfrom one in a drama of Calderon's, and it was much strengthened in the\r\ntaking. You may not now remember having read the play, but the incident\r\nmust have been familiar to you, or else your subconsciousness couldn't\r\nhave yielded it up to you so readily at the suggestion of the Spanish\r\ncoin, could it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did read a lot of Elizabethan drama in my senior year at college,\"\r\nadmitted Cosmo, \"and this piece of Beaumont and Fletcher's may have\r\nbeen one of those I read; but I totally fail to recall now what it was\r\nall about.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't have the cheek to declare that you don't remember the\r\n'Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' will you?\" asked Stuyvesant. \"Very obviously\r\nit was the adventure of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman that\r\nthe York shilling suggested to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll admit that I do recollect Irving's story now,\" the other\r\nconfessed.\r\n\r\n\"So the embroidery on the dream-gown gives the first of your strange\r\nsituations; and the three others were suggested by the coins you have\r\nbeen using as buttons,\" said Paul Stuyvesant. \"There is only one thing\r\nnow that puzzles me: that is the country church and the noon wedding\r\nand the beautiful bride.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that he turned over the folds of the silken garment that hung\r\nover his arm.\r\n\r\nCosmo Waynflete hesitated a moment and a blush mantled his cheek. Then\r\nhe looked his friend in the face and said: \"I think I can account for\r\nmy dreaming about her--I can account for that easily enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"So can I,\" said Paul Stuyvesant, as he held up the photograph of a\r\nlovely American girl that he had just found in the pocket of the\r\ndream-gown of the Japanese ambassador.\r\n\r\n(1896.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RIVAL GHOSTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe good ship sped on her way across the calm Atlantic. It was an\r\noutward passage, according to the little charts which the company had\r\ncharily distributed, but most of the passengers were homeward bound,\r\nafter a summer of rest and recreation, and they were counting the days\r\nbefore they might hope to see Fire Island Light. On the lee side of the\r\nboat, comfortably sheltered from the wind, and just by the door of the\r\ncaptain's room (which was theirs during the day), sat a little group of\r\nreturning Americans. The Duchess (she was down on the purser's list as\r\nMrs. Martin, but her friends and familiars called her the Duchess of\r\nWashington Square) and Baby Van Rensselaer (she was quite old enough to\r\nvote, had her sex been entitled to that duty, but as the younger of two\r\nsisters she was still the baby of the family)--the Duchess and Baby Van\r\nRensselaer were discussing the pleasant English voice and the not\r\nunpleasant English accent of a manly young lordling who was going to\r\nAmerica for sport. Uncle Larry and Dear Jones were enticing each other\r\ninto a bet on the ship's run of the morrow.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you two to one she don't make 420,\" said Dear Jones.\r\n\r\n\"I'll take it,\" answered Uncle Larry. \"We made 427 the fifth day last\r\nyear.\" It was Uncle Larry's seventeenth visit to Europe, and this was\r\ntherefore his thirty-fourth voyage.\r\n\r\n\"And when did you get in?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer. \"I don't care a\r\nbit about the run, so long as we get in soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"We crossed the bar Sunday night, just seven days after we left\r\nQueenstown, and we dropped anchor off Quarantine at three o'clock on\r\nMonday morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope we sha'n't do that this time. I can't seem to sleep any when\r\nthe boat stops.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can, but I didn't,\" continued Uncle Larry, \"because my state-room\r\nwas the most for'ard in the boat, and the donkey-engine that let down\r\nthe anchor was right over my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you got up and saw the sun rise over the bay,\" said Dear Jones,\r\n\"with the electric lights of the city twinkling in the distance, and\r\nthe first faint flush of the dawn in the east just over Fort Lafayette,\r\nand the rosy tinge which spread softly upward, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you both come back together?\" asked the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"Because he has crossed thirty-four times you must not suppose he has a\r\nmonopoly in sunrises,\" retorted Dear Jones. \"No; this was my own\r\nsunrise; and a mighty pretty one it was too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not matching sunrises with you,\" remarked Uncle Larry calmly; \"but\r\nI'm willing to back a merry jest called forth by my sunrise against any\r\ntwo merry jests called forth by yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess reluctantly that my sunrise evoked no merry jest at all.\"\r\nDear Jones was an honest man, and would scorn to invent a merry jest on\r\nthe spur of the moment.\r\n\r\n\"That's where my sunrise has the call,\" said Uncle Larry, complacently.\r\n\r\n\"What was the merry jest?\" was Baby Van Rensselaer's inquiry, the\r\nnatural result of a feminine curiosity thus artistically excited.\r\n\r\n\"Well, here it is. I was standing aft, near a patriotic American and a\r\nwandering Irishman, and the patriotic American rashly declared that you\r\ncouldn't see a sunrise like that anywhere in Europe, and this gave the\r\nIrishman his chance, and he said, 'Sure ye don't have 'm here till we're\r\nthrough with 'em over there.'\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" said Dear Jones, thoughtfully, \"that they do have some\r\nthings over there better than we do; for instance, umbrellas.\"\r\n\r\n\"And gowns,\" added the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"And antiquities\"--this was Uncle Larry's contribution.\r\n\r\n\"And we do have some things so much better in America!\" protested Baby\r\nVan Rensselaer, as yet uncorrupted by any worship of the effete\r\nmonarchies of despotic Europe. \"We make lots of things a great deal\r\nnicer than you can get them in Europe--especially ice-cream.\"\r\n\r\n\"And pretty girls,\" added Dear Jones; but he did not look at her.\r\n\r\n\"And spooks,\" remarked Uncle Larry, casually.\r\n\r\n\"Spooks?\" queried the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"Spooks. I maintain the word. Ghost, if you like that better, or\r\nspectres. We turn out the best quality of spook----\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget the lovely ghost stories about the Rhine and the Black\r\nForest,\" interrupted Miss Van Rensselaer, with feminine inconsistency.\r\n\r\n\"I remember the Rhine and the Black Forest and all the other haunts of\r\nelves and fairies and hobgoblins; but for good, honest spooks there is\r\nno place like home. And what differentiates our spook--_spiritus\r\nAmericanus_--from the ordinary ghost of literature is that it\r\nresponds to the American sense of humor. Take Irving's stories, for\r\nexample. The 'Headless Horseman'--that's a comic ghost story. And Rip\r\nVan Winkle--consider what humor, and what good humor, there is in the\r\ntelling of his meeting with the goblin crew of Hendrik Hudson's men! A\r\nstill better example of this American way of dealing with legend and\r\nmystery is the marvellous tale of the rival ghosts.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rival ghosts!\" queried the Duchess and Baby Van Rensselaer\r\ntogether. \"Who were they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I ever tell you about them?\" answered Uncle Larry, a gleam of\r\napproaching joy flashing from his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Since he is bound to tell us sooner or later, we'd better be resigned\r\nand hear it now,\" said Dear Jones.\r\n\r\n\"If you are not more eager, I won't tell it at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do, Uncle Larry! you know I just dote on ghost stories,\" pleaded\r\nBaby Van Rensselaer.\r\n\r\n\"Once upon a time,\" began Uncle Larry--\"in fact, a very few years\r\nago--there lived in the thriving town of New York a young American\r\ncalled Duncan--Eliphalet Duncan. Like his name, he was half Yankee\r\nand half Scotch, and naturally he was a lawyer, and had come to New\r\nYork to make his way. His father was a Scotchman who had come over\r\nand settled in Boston and married a Salem girl. When Eliphalet Duncan\r\nwas about twenty he lost both of his parents. His father left him\r\nenough money to give him a start, and a strong feeling of pride in\r\nhis Scotch birth; you see there was a title in the family in\r\nScotland, and although Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a\r\nyounger son, yet he always remembered, and always bade his only son\r\nto remember, that this ancestry was noble. His mother left him her\r\nfull share of Yankee grit and a little old house in Salem which had\r\nbelonged to her family for more than two hundred years. She was a\r\nHitchcock, and the Hitchcocks had been settled in Salem since the\r\nyear 1. It was a great-great-grandfather of Mr. Eliphalet Hitchcock\r\nwho was foremost in the time of the Salem witchcraft craze. And this\r\nlittle old house which she left to my friend Eliphalet Duncan was\r\nhaunted.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the ghost of one of the witches, of course?\" interrupted Dear\r\nJones.\r\n\r\n\"Now how could it be the ghost of a witch, since the witches were all\r\nburned at the stake? You never heard of anybody who was burned having a\r\nghost, did you?\" asked Uncle Larry.\r\n\r\n\"That's an argument in favor of cremation, at any rate,\" replied Dear\r\nJones, evading the direct question.\r\n\r\n\"It is, if you don't like ghosts. I do,\" said Baby Van Rensselaer.\r\n\r\n\"And so do I,\" added Uncle Larry. \"I love a ghost as dearly as an\r\nEnglishman loves a lord.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on with your story,\" said the Duchess, majestically overruling all\r\nextraneous discussion.\r\n\r\n\"This little old house at Salem was haunted,\" resumed Uncle Larry. \"And\r\nby a very distinguished ghost--or at least by a ghost with very\r\nremarkable attributes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was he like?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with a premonitory\r\nshiver of anticipatory delight.\r\n\r\n\"It had a lot of peculiarities. In the first place, it never appeared\r\nto the master of the house. Mostly it confined its visitations to\r\nunwelcome guests. In the course of the last hundred years it had\r\nfrightened away four successive mothers-in-law, while never intruding\r\non the head of the household.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess that ghost had been one of the boys when he was alive and in\r\nthe flesh.\" This was Dear Jones's contribution to the telling of the\r\ntale.\r\n\r\n\"In the second place,\" continued Uncle Larry, \"it never frightened\r\nanybody the first time it appeared. Only on the second visit were the\r\nghost-seers scared; but then they were scared enough for twice, and\r\nthey rarely mustered up courage enough to risk a third interview. One\r\nof the most curious characteristics of this well-meaning spook was that\r\nit had no face--or at least that nobody ever saw its face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he kept his countenance veiled?\" queried the Duchess, who was\r\nbeginning to remember that she never did like ghost stories.\r\n\r\n\"That was what I was never able to find out. I have asked several\r\npeople who saw the ghost, and none of them could tell me anything about\r\nits face, and yet while in its presence they never noticed its\r\nfeatures, and never remarked on their absence or concealment. It was\r\nonly afterwards when they tried to recall calmly all the circumstances\r\nof meeting with the mysterious stranger that they became aware that\r\nthey had not seen its face. And they could not say whether the features\r\nwere covered, or whether they were wanting, or what the trouble was.\r\nThey knew only that the face was never seen. And no matter how often\r\nthey might see it, they never fathomed this mystery. To this day nobody\r\nknows whether the ghost which used to haunt the little old house in\r\nSalem had a face, or what manner of face it had.\"\r\n\r\n\"How awfully weird!\" said Baby Van Rensselaer. \"And why did the ghost\r\ngo away?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't said it went away,\" answered Uncle Larry, with much dignity.\r\n\r\n\"But you said it _used_ to haunt the little old house at Salem, so\r\nI supposed it had moved. Didn't it?\" the young lady asked.\r\n\r\n\"You shall be told in due time. Eliphalet Duncan used to spend most of\r\nhis summer vacations at Salem, and the ghost never bothered him at all,\r\nfor he was the master of the house--much to his disgust, too, because\r\nhe wanted to see for himself the mysterious tenant at will of his\r\nproperty. But he never saw it, never. He arranged with friends to call\r\nhim whenever it might appear, and he slept in the next room with the\r\ndoor open; and yet when their frightened cries waked him the ghost was\r\ngone, and his only reward was to hear reproachful sighs as soon as he\r\nwent back to bed. You see, the ghost thought it was not fair of\r\nEliphalet to seek an introduction which was plainly unwelcome.\"\r\n\r\nDear Jones interrupted the story-teller by getting up and tucking a\r\nheavy rug more snugly around Baby Van Rensselaer's feet, for the sky\r\nwas now overcast and gray, and the air was damp and penetrating.\r\n\r\n\"One fine spring morning,\" pursued Uncle Larry, \"Eliphalet Duncan\r\nreceived great news. I told you that there was a title in the family in\r\nScotland, and that Eliphalet's father was the younger son of a younger\r\nson. Well, it happened that all Eliphalet's father's brothers and\r\nuncles had died off without male issue except the eldest son of the\r\neldest son, and he, of course, bore the title, and was Baron Duncan of\r\nDuncan. Now the great news that Eliphalet Duncan received in New York\r\none fine spring morning was that Baron Duncan and his only son had been\r\nyachting in the Hebrides, and they had been caught in a black squall,\r\nand they were both dead. So my friend Eliphalet Duncan inherited the\r\ntitle and the estates.\"\r\n\r\n\"How romantic!\" said the Duchess. \"So he was a baron!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Uncle Larry, \"he was a baron if he chose. But he\r\ndidn't choose.\"\r\n\r\n\"More fool he!\" said Dear Jones, sententiously.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Uncle Larry, \"I'm not so sure of that. You see,\r\nEliphalet Duncan was half Scotch and half Yankee, and he had two eyes\r\nto the main chance. He held his tongue about his windfall of luck until\r\nhe could find out whether the Scotch estates were enough to keep up the\r\nScotch title. He soon discovered that they were not, and that the late\r\nLord Duncan, having married money, kept up such state as he could out\r\nof the revenues of the dowry of Lady Duncan. And Eliphalet, he decided\r\nthat he would rather be a well-fed lawyer in New York, living\r\ncomfortably on his practice, than a starving lord in Scotland, living\r\nscantily on his title.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he kept his title?\" asked the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Uncle Larry, \"he kept it quiet. I knew it, and a\r\nfriend or two more. But Eliphalet was a sight too smart to put 'Baron\r\nDuncan of Duncan, Attorney and Counsellor at Law,' on his shingle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has all this got to do with your ghost?\" asked Dear Jones,\r\npertinently.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing with that ghost, but a good deal with another ghost. Eliphalet\r\nwas very learned in spirit lore--perhaps because he owned the haunted\r\nhouse at Salem, perhaps because he was a Scotchman by descent. At all\r\nevents, he had made a special study of the wraiths and white ladies and\r\nbanshees and bogies of all kinds whose sayings and doings and warnings\r\nare recorded in the annals of the Scottish nobility. In fact, he was\r\nacquainted with the habits of every reputable spook in the Scotch\r\npeerage. And he knew that there was a Duncan ghost attached to the\r\nperson of the holder of the title of Baron Duncan of Duncan.\"\r\n\r\n\"So, besides being the owner of a haunted house in Salem, he was also a\r\nhaunted man in Scotland?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer.\r\n\r\n\"Just so. But the Scotch ghost was not unpleasant, like the Salem\r\nghost, although it had one peculiarity in common with its\r\ntrans-atlantic fellow-spook. It never appeared to the holder of the\r\ntitle, just as the other never was visible to the owner of the house.\r\nIn fact, the Duncan ghost was never seen at all. It was a guardian\r\nangel only. Its sole duty was to be in personal attendance on Baron\r\nDuncan of Duncan, and to warn him of impending evil. The traditions of\r\nthe house told that the Barons of Duncan had again and again felt a\r\npremonition of ill fortune. Some of them had yielded and withdrawn from\r\nthe venture they had undertaken, and it had failed dismally. Some had\r\nbeen obstinate, and had hardened their hearts, and had gone on reckless\r\nto defeat and to death. In no case had a Lord Duncan been exposed to\r\nperil without fair warning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how came it that the father and son were lost in the yacht off\r\nthe Hebrides?\" asked Dear Jones.\r\n\r\n\"Because they were too enlightened to yield to superstition. There is\r\nextant now a letter of Lord Duncan, written to his wife a few minutes\r\nbefore he and his son set sail, in which he tells her how hard he has\r\nhad to struggle with an almost overmastering desire to give up the\r\ntrip. Had he obeyed the friendly warning of the family ghost, the\r\nletter would have been spared a journey across the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the ghost leave Scotland for America as soon as the old baron\r\ndied?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with much interest.\r\n\r\n\"How did he come over,\" queried Dear Jones--\"in the steerage, or as a\r\ncabin passenger?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Uncle Larry, calmly, \"and Eliphalet didn't\r\nknow. For as he was in no danger, and stood in no need of warning, he\r\ncouldn't tell whether the ghost was on duty or not. Of course he was on\r\nthe watch for it all the time. But he never got any proof of its\r\npresence until he went down to the little old house of Salem, just\r\nbefore the Fourth of July. He took a friend down with him--a young\r\nfellow who had been in the regular army since the day Fort Sumter was\r\nfired on, and who thought that after four years of the little\r\nunpleasantness down South, including six months in Libby, and after ten\r\nyears of fighting the bad Indians on the plains, he wasn't likely to be\r\nmuch frightened by a ghost. Well, Eliphalet and the officer sat out on\r\nthe porch all the evening smoking and talking over points in military\r\nlaw. A little after twelve o'clock, just as they began to think it was\r\nabout time to turn in, they heard the most ghastly noise in the house.\r\nIt wasn't a shriek, or a howl, or a yell, or anything they could put a\r\nname to. It was an undeterminate, inexplicable shiver and shudder of\r\nsound, which went wailing out of the window. The officer had been at\r\nCold Harbor, but he felt himself getting colder this time. Eliphalet\r\nknew it was the ghost who haunted the house. As this weird sound died\r\naway, it was followed by another, sharp, short, blood-curdling in its\r\nintensity. Something in this cry seemed familiar to Eliphalet, and he\r\nfelt sure that it proceeded from the family ghost, the warning wraith\r\nof the Duncans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I understand you to intimate that both ghosts were there together?\"\r\ninquired the Duchess, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Both of them were there,\" answered Uncle Larry. \"You see, one of them\r\nbelonged to the house, and had to be there all the time, and the other\r\nwas attached to the person of Baron Duncan, and had to follow him\r\nthere; wherever he was, there was that ghost also. But Eliphalet, he\r\nhad scarcely time to think this out when he heard both sounds again,\r\nnot one after another, but both together, and something told him--some\r\nsort of an instinct he had--that those two ghosts didn't agree, didn't\r\nget on together, didn't exactly hit it off; in fact, that they were\r\nquarrelling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quarrelling ghosts! Well, I never!\" was Baby Van Rensselaer's remark.\r\n\r\n\"It is a blessed thing to see ghosts dwell together in unity,\" said\r\nDear Jones.\r\n\r\nAnd the Duchess added, \"It would certainly be setting a better\r\nexample.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" resumed Uncle Larry, \"that two waves of light or of sound\r\nmay interfere and produce darkness or silence. So it was with these\r\nrival spooks. They interfered, but they did not produce silence or\r\ndarkness. On the contrary, as soon as Eliphalet and the officer went\r\ninto the house, there began at once a series of spiritualistic\r\nmanifestations--a regular dark seance. A tambourine was played upon, a\r\nbell was rung, and a flaming banjo went singing around the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did they get the banjo?\" asked Dear Jones, sceptically.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Materialized it, maybe, just as they did the tambourine.\r\nYou don't suppose a quiet New York lawyer kept a stock of musical\r\ninstruments large enough to fit out a strolling minstrel troupe just on\r\nthe chance of a pair of ghosts coming to give him a surprise party, do\r\nyou? Every spook has its own instrument of torture. Angels play on\r\nharps, I'm informed, and spirits delight in banjos and tambourines.\r\nThese spooks of Eliphalet Duncan's were ghosts with all modern\r\nimprovements, and I guess they were capable of providing their own\r\nmusical weapons. At all events, they had them there in the little old\r\nhouse at Salem the night Eliphalet and his friend came down. And they\r\nplayed on them, and they rang the bell, and they rapped here, there,\r\nand everywhere. And they kept it up all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"All night?\" asked the awe-stricken Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"All night long,\" said Uncle Larry, solemnly; \"and the next night too.\r\nEliphalet did not get a wink of sleep, neither did his friend. On the\r\nsecond night the house ghost was seen by the officer; on the third\r\nnight it showed itself again; and the next morning the officer packed\r\nhis gripsack and took the first train to Boston. He was a New-Yorker,\r\nbut he said he'd sooner go to Boston than see that ghost again.\r\nEliphalet wasn't scared at all, partly because he never saw either the\r\ndomiciliary or the titular spook, and partly because he felt himself on\r\nfriendly terms with the spirit world, and didn't scare easily. But\r\nafter losing three nights' sleep and the society of his friend, he\r\nbegan to be a little impatient, and to think that the thing had gone\r\nfar enough. You see, while in a way he was fond of ghosts, yet he liked\r\nthem best one at a time. Two ghosts were one too many. He wasn't bent\r\non making a collection of spooks. He and one ghost were company, but he\r\nand two ghosts were a crowd.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he do?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he couldn't do anything. He waited awhile, hoping they would get\r\ntired; but he got tired out first. You see, it comes natural to a spook\r\nto sleep in the daytime, but a man wants to sleep nights, and they\r\nwouldn't let him sleep nights. They kept on wrangling and quarrelling\r\nincessantly; they manifested and they dark-seanced as regularly as the\r\nold clock on the stairs struck twelve; they rapped and they rang bells\r\nand they banged the tambourine and they threw the flaming banjo about\r\nthe house, and, worse than all, they swore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know that spirits were addicted to bad language,\" said the\r\nDuchess.\r\n\r\n\"How did he know they were swearing? Could he hear them?\" asked Dear\r\nJones.\r\n\r\n\"That was just it,\" responded Uncle Larry; \"he could not hear them--at\r\nleast, not distinctly. There were inarticulate murmurs and stifled\r\nrumblings. But the impression produced on him was that they were\r\nswearing. If they had only sworn right out, he would not have minded it\r\nso much, because he would have known the worst. But the feeling that\r\nthe air was full of suppressed profanity was very wearing, and after\r\nstanding it for a week he gave up in disgust and went to the White\r\nMountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leaving them to fight it out, I suppose,\" interjected Baby Van\r\nRensselaer.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" explained Uncle Larry. \"They could not quarrel unless he\r\nwas present. You see, he could not leave the titular ghost behind him,\r\nand the domiciliary ghost could not leave the house. When he went away\r\nhe took the family ghost with him, leaving the house ghost behind. Now\r\nspooks can't quarrel when they are a hundred miles apart any more than\r\nmen can.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what happened afterwards?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with a\r\npretty impatience.\r\n\r\n\"A most marvellous thing happened. Eliphalet Duncan went to the White\r\nMountains, and in the car of the railroad that runs to the top of Mount\r\nWashington he met a classmate whom he had not seen for years, and this\r\nclassmate introduced Duncan to his sister, and this sister was a\r\nremarkably pretty girl, and Duncan fell in love with her at first\r\nsight, and by the time he got to the top of Mount Washington he was so\r\ndeep in love that he began to consider his own unworthiness, and to\r\nwonder whether she might ever be induced to care for him a little--ever\r\nso little.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that is so marvellous a thing,\" said Dear Jones,\r\nglancing at Baby Van Rensselaer.\r\n\r\n\"Who was she?\" asked the Duchess, who had once lived in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n\"She was Miss Kitty Sutton, of San Francisco, and she was a daughter of\r\nold Judge Sutton, of the firm of Pixley & Sutton.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very respectable family,\" assented the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"I hope she wasn't a daughter of that loud and vulgar old Mrs. Sutton\r\nwhom I met at Saratoga one summer four or five years ago?\" said Dear\r\nJones.\r\n\r\n\"Probably she was,\" Uncle Larry responded.\r\n\r\n\"She was a horrid old woman. The boys used to call her Mother Gorgon.\"\r\n\r\n\"The pretty Kitty Sutton with whom Eliphalet Duncan had fallen in love\r\nwas the daughter of Mother Gorgon. But he never saw the mother, who was\r\nin Frisco, or Los Angeles, or Santa Fe, or somewhere out West, and he\r\nsaw a great deal of the daughter, who was up in the White Mountains.\r\nShe was travelling with her brother and his wife, and as they journeyed\r\nfrom hotel to hotel Duncan went with them, and filled out the\r\nquartette. Before the end of the summer he began to think about\r\nproposing. Of course he had lots of chances, going on excursions as\r\nthey were every day. He made up his mind to seize the first\r\nopportunity, and that very evening he took her out for a moonlight row\r\non Lake Winipiseogee. As he handed her into the boat he resolved to do\r\nit, and he had a glimmer of a suspicion that she knew he was going to\r\ndo it, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Girls,\" said Dear Jones, \"never go out in a row-boat at night with a\r\nyoung man unless you mean to accept him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes it's best to refuse him, and get it over once for all,\" said\r\nBaby Van Rensselaer, impersonally.\r\n\r\n\"As Eliphalet took the oars he felt a sudden chill. He tried to shake\r\nit off, but in vain. He began to have a growing consciousness of\r\nimpending evil. Before he had taken ten strokes--and he was a swift\r\noarsman--he was aware of a mysterious presence between him and Miss\r\nSutton.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it the guardian-angel ghost warning him off the match?\"\r\ninterrupted Dear Jones.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what it was,\" said Uncle Larry. \"And he yielded to it, and\r\nkept his peace, and rowed Miss Sutton back to the hotel with his\r\nproposal unspoken.\"\r\n\r\n\"More fool he,\" said Dear Jones. \"It will take more than one ghost to\r\nkeep me from proposing when my mind is made up.\" And he looked at Baby\r\nVan Rensselaer.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning,\" continued Uncle Larry, \"Eliphalet overslept\r\nhimself, and when he went down to a late breakfast he found that the\r\nSuttons had gone to New York by the morning train. He wanted to follow\r\nthem at once, and again he felt the mysterious presence overpowering\r\nhis will. He struggled two days, and at last he roused himself to do\r\nwhat he wanted in spite of the spook. When he arrived in New York it\r\nwas late in the evening. He dressed himself hastily, and went to the\r\nhotel where the Suttons were, in the hope of seeing at least her\r\nbrother. The guardian angel fought every inch of the walk with him,\r\nuntil he began to wonder whether, if Miss Sutton were to take him, the\r\nspook would forbid the banns. At the hotel he saw no one that night,\r\nand he went home determined to call as early as he could the next\r\nafternoon, and make an end of it. When he left his office about two\r\no'clock the next day to learn his fate, he had not walked five blocks\r\nbefore he discovered that the wraith of the Duncans had withdrawn his\r\nopposition to the suit. There was no feeling of impending evil, no\r\nresistance, no struggle, no consciousness of an opposing presence.\r\nEliphalet was greatly encouraged. He walked briskly to the hotel; he\r\nfound Miss Sutton alone. He asked her the question, and got his\r\nanswer.\"\r\n\r\n\"She accepted him, of course?\" said Baby Van Rensselaer.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said Uncle Larry. \"And while they were in the first flush\r\nof joy, swapping confidences and confessions, her brother came into the\r\nparlor with an expression of pain on his face and a telegram in his\r\nhand. The former was caused by the latter, which was from Frisco, and\r\nwhich announced the sudden death of Mrs. Sutton, their mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that was why the ghost no longer opposed the match?\" questioned\r\nDear Jones.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. You see, the family ghost knew that Mother Gorgon was an\r\nawful obstacle to Duncan's happiness, so it warned him. But the moment\r\nthe obstacle was removed, it gave its consent at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe fog was lowering its thick, damp curtain, and it was beginning to\r\nbe difficult to see from one end of the boat to the other. Dear Jones\r\ntightened the rug which enwrapped Baby Van Rensselaer, and then\r\nwithdrew again into his own substantial coverings.\r\n\r\nUncle Larry paused in his story long enough to light another of the\r\ntiny cigars he always smoked.\r\n\r\n\"I infer that Lord Duncan\"--the Duchess was scrupulous in the bestowal\r\nof titles--\"saw no more of the ghosts after he was married.\"\r\n\r\n\"He never saw them at all, at any time, either before or since. But\r\nthey came very near breaking off the match, and thus breaking two young\r\nhearts.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say that they knew any just cause or impediment why\r\nthey should not forever after hold their peace?\" asked Dear Jones.\r\n\r\n\"How could a ghost, or even two ghosts, keep a girl from marrying the\r\nman she loved?\" This was Baby Van Rensselaer's question.\r\n\r\n\"It seems curious, doesn't it?\" and Uncle Larry tried to warm himself\r\nby two or three sharp pulls at his fiery little cigar. \"And the\r\ncircumstances are quite as curious as the fact itself. You see, Miss\r\nSutton wouldn't be married for a year after her mother's death, so she\r\nand Duncan had lots of time to tell each other all they knew. Eliphalet\r\ngot to know a good deal about the girls she went to school with; and\r\nKitty soon learned all about his family. He didn't tell her about the\r\ntitle for a long time, as he wasn't one to brag. But he described to\r\nher the little old house at Salem. And one evening towards the end of\r\nthe summer, the wedding-day having been appointed for early in\r\nSeptember, she told him that she didn't want a bridal tour at all; she\r\njust wanted to go down to the little old house at Salem to spend her\r\nhoneymoon in peace and quiet, with nothing to do and nobody to bother\r\nthem. Well, Eliphalet jumped at the suggestion: it suited him down to\r\nthe ground. All of a sudden he remembered the spooks, and it knocked\r\nhim all of a heap. He had told her about the Duncan banshee, and the\r\nidea of having an ancestral ghost in personal attendance on her husband\r\ntickled her immensely. But he had never said anything about the ghost\r\nwhich haunted the little old house at Salem. He knew she would be\r\nfrightened out of her wits if the house ghost revealed itself to her,\r\nand he saw at once that it would be impossible to go to Salem on their\r\nwedding trip. So he told her all about it, and how whenever he went to\r\nSalem the two ghosts interfered, and gave dark seances and manifested\r\nand materialized and made the place absolutely impossible. Kitty\r\nlistened in silence, and Eliphalet thought she had changed her mind.\r\nBut she hadn't done anything of the kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like a man--to think she was going to,\" remarked Baby Van\r\nRensselaer.\r\n\r\n\"She just told him she could not bear ghosts herself, but she would not\r\nmarry a man who was afraid of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just like a girl--to be so inconsistent,\" remarked Dear Jones.\r\n\r\nUncle Larry's tiny cigar had long been extinct. He lighted a new one,\r\nand continued: \"Eliphalet protested in vain. Kitty said her mind was\r\nmade up. She was determined to pass her honeymoon in the little old\r\nhouse at Salem, and she was equally determined not to go there as long\r\nas there were any ghosts there. Until he could assure her that the\r\nspectral tenant had received notice to quit, and that there was no\r\ndanger of manifestations and materializing, she refused to be married\r\nat all. She did not intend to have her honeymoon interrupted by two\r\nwrangling ghosts, and the wedding could be postponed until he had made\r\nready the house for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was an unreasonable young woman,\" said the Duchess.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's what Eliphalet thought, much as he was in love with her.\r\nAnd he believed he could talk her out of her determination. But he\r\ncouldn't. She was set. And when a girl is set, there's nothing to do\r\nbut to yield to the inevitable. And that's just what Eliphalet did. He\r\nsaw he would either have to give her up or to get the ghosts out; and\r\nas he loved her and did not care for the ghosts, he resolved to tackle\r\nthe ghosts. He had clear grit, Eliphalet had--he was half Scotch and\r\nhalf Yankee, and neither breed turns tail in a hurry. So he made his\r\nplans and he went down to Salem. As he said good-bye to Kitty he had an\r\nimpression that she was sorry she had made him go; but she kept up\r\nbravely, and put a bold face on it, and saw him off, and went home and\r\ncried for an hour, and was perfectly miserable until he came back the\r\nnext day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he succeed in driving the ghosts away?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer,\r\nwith great interest.\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I'm coming to,\" said Uncle Larry, pausing at the\r\ncritical moment, in the manner of the trained story-teller. \"You see,\r\nEliphalet had got a rather tough job, and he would gladly have had an\r\nextension of time on the contract, but he had to choose between the\r\ngirl and the ghosts, and he wanted the girl. He tried to invent or\r\nremember some short and easy way with ghosts, but he couldn't. He\r\nwished that somebody had invented a specific for spooks--something that\r\nwould make the ghosts come out of the house and die in the yard. He\r\nwondered if he could not tempt the ghosts to run in debt, so that he\r\nmight get the sheriff to help him. He wondered also whether the ghosts\r\ncould not be overcome with strong drink--a dissipated spook, a spook\r\nwith delirium tremens, might be committed to the inebriate asylum. But\r\nnone of these things seemed feasible.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he do?\" interrupted Dear Jones. \"The learned counsel will\r\nplease speak to the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will regret this unseemly haste,\" said Uncle Larry, gravely, \"when\r\nyou know what really happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it, Uncle Larry?\" asked Baby Van Rensselaer. \"I'm all\r\nimpatience.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Uncle Larry proceeded:\r\n\r\n\"Eliphalet went down to the little old house at Salem, and as soon as\r\nthe clock struck twelve the rival ghosts began wrangling as before.\r\nRaps here, there, and everywhere, ringing bells, banging tambourines,\r\nstrumming banjos sailing about the room, and all the other\r\nmanifestations and materializations followed one another just as they\r\nhad the summer before. The only difference Eliphalet could detect was a\r\nstronger flavor in the spectral profanity; and this, of course, was\r\nonly a vague impression, for he did not actually hear a single word. He\r\nwaited awhile in patience, listening and watching. Of course he never\r\nsaw either of the ghosts, because neither of them could appear to him.\r\nAt last he got his dander up, and he thought it was about time to\r\ninterfere, so he rapped on the table, and asked for silence. As soon as\r\nhe felt that the spooks were listening to him he explained the\r\nsituation to them. He told them he was in love, and that he could not\r\nmarry unless they vacated the house. He appealed to them as old\r\nfriends, and he laid claim to their gratitude. The titular ghost had\r\nbeen sheltered by the Duncan family for hundreds of years, and the\r\ndomiciliary ghost had had free lodging in the little old house at Salem\r\nfor nearly two centuries. He implored them to settle their differences,\r\nand to get him out of his difficulty at once. He suggested that they\r\nhad better fight it out then and there, and see who was master. He had\r\nbrought down with him all needful weapons. And he pulled out his\r\nvalise, and spread on the table a pair of navy revolvers, a pair of\r\nshot-guns, a pair of duelling-swords, and a couple of bowie-knives. He\r\noffered to serve as second for both parties, and to give the word when\r\nto begin. He also took out of his valise a pack of cards and a bottle\r\nof poison, telling them that if they wished to avoid carnage they might\r\ncut the cards to see which one should take the poison. Then he waited\r\nanxiously for their reply. For a little space there was silence. Then\r\nhe became conscious of a tremulous shivering in one corner of the room,\r\nand he remembered that he had heard from that direction what sounded\r\nlike a frightened sigh when he made the first suggestion of the duel.\r\nSomething told him that this was the domiciliary ghost, and that it was\r\nbadly scared. Then he was impressed by a certain movement in the\r\nopposite corner of the room, as though the titular ghost were drawing\r\nhimself up with offended dignity. Eliphalet couldn't exactly see those\r\nthings, because he never saw the ghosts, but he felt them. After a\r\nsilence of nearly a minute a voice came from the corner where the\r\nfamily ghost stood--a voice strong and full, but trembling slightly\r\nwith suppressed passion. And this voice told Eliphalet it was plain\r\nenough that he had not long been the head of the Duncans, and that he\r\nhad never properly considered the characteristics of his race if now he\r\nsupposed that one of his blood could draw his sword against a woman.\r\nEliphalet said he had never suggested that the Duncan ghost should\r\nraise his hand against a woman, and all he wanted was that the Duncan\r\nghost should fight the other ghost. And then the voice told Eliphalet\r\nthat the other ghost was a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" said Dear Jones, sitting up suddenly. \"You don't mean to tell\r\nme that the ghost which haunted the house was a woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those were the very words Eliphalet Duncan used,\" said Uncle Larry;\r\n\"but he did not need to wait for the answer. All at once he recalled\r\nthe traditions about the domiciliary ghost, and he knew that what the\r\ntitular ghost said was the fact. He had never thought of the sex of a\r\nspook, but there was no doubt whatever that the house ghost was a\r\nwoman. No sooner was this firmly fixed in Eliphalet's mind than he saw\r\nhis way out of the difficulty. The ghosts must be married!--for then\r\nthere would be no more interference, no more quarrelling, no more\r\nmanifestations and materializations, no more dark seances, with their\r\nraps and bells and tambourines and banjos. At first the ghosts would\r\nnot hear of it. The voice in the corner declared that the Duncan wraith\r\nhad never thought of matrimony. But Eliphalet argued with them, and\r\npleaded and persuaded and coaxed, and dwelt on the advantages of\r\nmatrimony. He had to confess, of course, that he did not know how to\r\nget a clergyman to marry them; but the voice from the corner gravely\r\ntold him that there need be no difficulty in regard to that, as there\r\nwas no lack of spiritual chaplains. Then, for the first time, the house\r\nghost spoke, a low, clear, gentle voice, and with a quaint,\r\nold-fashioned New England accent, which contrasted sharply with the\r\nbroad Scotch speech of the family ghost. She said that Eliphalet Duncan\r\nseemed to have forgotten that she was married. But this did not upset\r\nEliphalet at all; he remembered the whole case clearly, and he told her\r\nshe was not a married ghost, but a widow, since her husband had been\r\nhanged for murdering her. Then the Duncan ghost drew attention to the\r\ngreat disparity in their ages, saying that he was nearly four hundred\r\nand fifty years old, while she was barely two hundred. But Eliphalet\r\nhad not talked to juries for nothing; he just buckled to, and coaxed\r\nthose ghosts into matrimony. Afterwards he came to the conclusion that\r\nthey were willing to be coaxed, but at the time he thought he had\r\npretty hard work to convince them of the advantages of the plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he succeed? asked Baby Van Rensselaer, with a woman's interest in\r\nmatrimony.\r\n\r\n\"He did,\" said Uncle Larry. \"He talked the wraith of the Duncans and\r\nthe spectre of the little old house at Salem into a matrimonial\r\nengagement. And from the time they were engaged he had no more trouble\r\nwith them. They were rival ghosts no longer. They were married by their\r\nspiritual chaplain the very same day that Eliphalet Duncan met Kitty\r\nSutton in front of the railing of Grace Church. The ghostly bride and\r\nbridegroom went away at once on their bridal tour, and Lord and Lady\r\nDuncan went down to the little old house at Salem to pass their\r\nhoneymoon.\"\r\n\r\nUncle Larry stopped. His tiny cigar was out again. The tale of the\r\nrival ghosts was told. A solemn silence fell on the little party on the\r\ndeck of the ocean steamer, broken harshly by the hoarse roar of the\r\nfog-horn.\r\n\r\n(1883.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTEEN YEARS WITHOUT A BIRTHDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the journalist deftly dealt with the lobster _a la_ Newburg,\r\nas it bubbled in the chafing-dish before him, the deep-toned bell of\r\nthe church at the corner began to strike twelve.\r\n\r\n\"Give me your plates, quick,\" he said, \"and we'll drink Jack's health\r\nbefore it's to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe artist and the soldier and the professor of mathematics did as they\r\nwere told; and then they filled their glasses.\r\n\r\nThe journalist, still standing, looked the soldier in the eye, and\r\nsaid: \"Jack, this is the first time The Quartet has met since the old\r\nschool-days, ten years ago and more. That this reunion should take\r\nplace on your birthday doubles the pleasure of the occasion. We wish\r\nyou many happy returns of the day!\"\r\n\r\nThen the artist and the mathematician rose also, and they looked at the\r\nsoldier, and repeated together, \"Many happy returns of the day!\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon they emptied their glasses and sat down, and the soldier rose\r\nto his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, boys,\" he began, \"but I think you have already made me\r\nenjoy this one birthday three times over. It was yesterday that I was\r\ntwenty-six, and----\"\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't meet you till last night,\" interrupted the journalist;\r\n\"and yesterday was Sunday; and I couldn't get a box for the theatre and\r\nfind the other half of The Quartet all on Sunday, could I?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not complaining because yesterday was my real birthday,\" the\r\nsoldier returned, \"even if you have now protracted the celebration on\r\nto the third day--it's just struck midnight, you know. All I have to\r\nsay is, that since you have given me a triplicate birthday this time,\r\nany future anniversary will have to spread itself over four days if it\r\nwants to beat the record, that's all.\" And he took his seat again.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the artist, who had recently returned from Paris, \"that\r\nwon't happen till we see 'the week of the four Thursdays,' as the\r\nFrench say.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we sha'n't see that for a month of Sundays, I guess,\" the\r\njournalist rejoined.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence, and then the mathematician spoke for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n\"A quadruplex birthday will be odd enough, I grant you,\" he began, \"but\r\nI don't think it quite as remarkable as the case of the lady who had no\r\nbirthday for sixteen years after she was born.\"\r\n\r\nThe soldier and the artist and the journalist all looked at the\r\nprofessor of mathematics, and they all smiled; but his face remained\r\nperfectly grave.\r\n\r\n\"What's that you say?\" asked the journalist. \"Sixteen years without a\r\nbirthday? Isn't that a very large order?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know the lady herself?\" inquired the soldier.\r\n\r\n\"She was my grandmother,\" the mathematician answered. \"She had no\r\nbirthday for the first sixteen years of her life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that she did not celebrate her birthdays, I suppose,\" the\r\nartist remarked. \"That's nothing. I know lots of families where they\r\ndon't keep any anniversaries at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" persisted the mathematician. \"I meant what I said, and precisely\r\nwhat I said. My grandmother did not keep her first fifteen birthdays\r\nbecause she couldn't. She didn't have them to keep. They didn't happen.\r\nThe first time she had a chance to celebrate her birthday was when she\r\ncompleted her sixteenth year--and I need not tell you that the family\r\nmade the most of the event.\"\r\n\r\n\"This a real grandmother you are talking about,\" asked the journalist,\r\n\"and not a fairy godmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could understand her going without a birthday till she was four\r\nyears old,\" the soldier suggested, \"if she was born on the 29th of\r\nFebruary.\"\r\n\r\n\"That accounts for four years,\" the mathematician admitted, \"since my\r\ngrandmother _was_ born on the 29th of February.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what year?\" the soldier pursued. \"In 1796?\"\r\n\r\nThe professor of mathematics nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Then that accounts for eight years,\" said the soldier.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see that at all,\" exclaimed the artist.\r\n\r\n\"It's easy enough,\" the soldier explained. \"The year 1800 isn't a\r\nleap-year, you know. We have a leap-year every four years, except the\r\nfinal year of a century--1700, 1800, 1900.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't know that,\" said the artist.\r\n\r\n\"I'd forgotten it,\" remarked the journalist. \"But that gets us over\r\nonly half of the difficulty. He says his grandmother didn't have a\r\nbirthday till she was sixteen. We can all see now how it was she went\r\nwithout this annual luxury for the first eight years. But who robbed\r\nher of the birthdays she was entitled to when she was eight and twelve.\r\nThat's what I want to know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Born February 29, 1796, the Gregorian calendar deprives her of a\r\nbirthday in 1800,\" the soldier said. \"But she ought to have had her\r\nfirst chance February 29, 1804. I don't see how----\" and he paused in\r\ndoubt. \"Oh!\" he cried, suddenly; \"where was she living in 1804?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most of the time in Russia,\" the mathematician answered. \"Although the\r\nfamily went to England for a few days early in the year.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the date when they left Russia?\" asked the soldier, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"They sailed from St. Petersburg in a Russian bark on the 10th of\r\nFebruary,\" answered the professor of mathematics, \"and owing to\r\nhead-winds they did not reach England for a fortnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" cried the soldier. \"That's what I thought. That accounts for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see how,\" the artist declared; \"that is, unless you mean to\r\nsuggest that the Czar confiscated the little American girl's birthday\r\nand sent it to Siberia.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's plain enough,\" the soldier returned. \"We have the reformed\r\ncalendar, the Gregorian calendar, you know, and the Russians haven't.\r\nThey keep the old Julian calendar, and it's now ten days behind ours.\r\nThey celebrate Christmas three days after we have begun the new year.\r\nSo if the little girl left St. Petersburg in a Russian ship on February\r\n10, 1804, by the old reckoning, and was on the water two weeks, she\r\nwould land in England after March 1st by the new calendar.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to say,\" the artist inquired, \"the little girl came into an\r\nEnglish port thinking she was going to have her birthday the next week,\r\nand when she set foot on shore she found out that her birthday was\r\npassed the week before. Is that what you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the soldier; and the mathematician nodded also.\r\n\r\n\"Then all I have to say,\" the artist continued, \"is that it was a mean\r\ntrick to play on a child that had been looking forward to her first\r\nbirthday for eight years--to knock her into the middle of next week in\r\nthat fashion!\"\r\n\r\n\"And she had to go four years more for her next chance,\" said the\r\njournalist. \"Then she would be twelve. But you said she hadn't a\r\nbirthday till she was sixteen. How did she lose the one she was\r\nentitled to in 1808? She wasn't on a Russian ship again, was she?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the mathematician replied; \"she was on an American ship that\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the North Sea?\" asked the artist.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" was the calm answer; \"on the Pacific.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sailing east or west?\" cried the soldier.\r\n\r\n\"Sailing east,\" answered the professor of mathematics, smiling again.\r\n\r\n\"Then I see how it might happen,\" the soldier declared.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't,\" confessed the artist.\r\n\r\nThe journalist said nothing, as it seemed unprofessional to admit\r\nignorance of anything.\r\n\r\n\"It is simple enough,\" the soldier explained. \"You see, the world is\r\nrevolving about the sun steadily, and it is always high noon somewhere\r\non the globe. The day rolls round unceasing, and it is not cut off into\r\ntwenty-four hours. We happen to have taken the day of Greenwich or\r\nParis as the day of civilization, and we say that it begins earlier in\r\nChina and later in California; but it is all the same day, we say.\r\nTherefore there has to be some place out in the middle of the Pacific\r\nOcean where we lose or gain a day--if we are going east, we gain it; if\r\nwe are going west, we lose it. Now I suppose this little girl of twelve\r\nwas on her way from some Asiatic port to some American port, and they\r\nstopped on their voyage at Honolulu. Perhaps they dropped anchor there\r\njust before midnight on their February 28, 1808, thinking that the\r\nmorrow would be the 29th; but when they were hailed from the shore,\r\njust after midnight, they found out that it was already March 1st.\"\r\n\r\nAs the soldier finished, he looked at the mathematician for\r\nconfirmation of his explanation.\r\n\r\nThus appealed to, the professor of mathematics smiled and nodded, and\r\nsaid: \"You have hit it. That's just how it was that my grandmother lost\r\nthe birthday she ought to have had when she was twelve, and had to go\r\nfour years more without one.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so she really didn't have a birthday till she was sixteen!\" the\r\nartist observed. \"Well, all I can say is, your great-grandfather took\r\ntoo many chances. I don't think he gave the child a fair show. I hope\r\nhe made it up to her when she was sixteen--that's all!\"\r\n\r\nAn hour later The Quartet separated. The soldier and the artist walked\r\naway together, but the journalist delayed the mathematician.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" he began, \"that yarn about your grandmother was very\r\ninteresting. It is an extraordinary combination of coincidences. I\r\ncan see it in the Sunday paper with a scare-head--\r\n\r\n    'SIXTEEN YEARS WITHOUT A BIRTHDAY!'\r\n\r\nDo you mind my using it?\"\r\n\r\n\"But it isn't true,\" said the professor.\r\n\r\n\"Not true?\" echoed the journalist.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the mathematician. \"I made it up. I hadn't done my share\r\nof the talking, and I didn't want you to think I had nothing to say for\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a single word of truth in it?\" the journalist returned.\r\n\r\n\"Not a single word,\" was the mathematician's answer.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what of that?\" the journalist declared. \"I don't want to file it\r\nin an affidavit--I want to print it in a newspaper.\"\r\n\r\n(1894.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWINKLING OF AN EYE\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe telegraph messenger looked again at the address on the envelope in\r\nhis hand, and then scanned the house before which he was standing. It\r\nwas an old-fashioned building of brick, two stories high, with an attic\r\nabove; and it stood in an old-fashioned part of lower New York, not\r\nfar from the East River. Over the wide archway there was a small\r\nweather-worn sign, \"Ramapo Steel and Iron Works;\" and over the smaller\r\ndoor alongside was a still smaller sign, \"Whittier, Wheatcroft & Co.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the messenger-boy had made out the name, he opened this smaller\r\ndoor and entered the long, narrow store. Its sides and walls were\r\ncovered with bins and racks containing sample steel rails and iron\r\nbeams, and coils of wire of various sizes. Down at the end of the store\r\nwere desks where several clerks and book-keepers were at work.\r\n\r\nAs the messenger drew near, a red-headed office-boy blocked the\r\npassage, saying, somewhat aggressively, \"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got a telegram for Whittier, Wheatcroft & Co.,\" the messenger\r\nexplained, pugnaciously thrusting himself forward.\r\n\r\n\"In there!\" the office-boy returned, jerking his thumb over his\r\nshoulder towards the extreme end of the building, an extension, roofed\r\nwith glass and separated by a glass screen from the space where the\r\nclerks were at work.\r\n\r\nThe messenger pushed open the glazed door of this private office, a\r\nbell jingled over his head, and the three occupants of the room looked\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"Whittier, Wheatcroft & Co.?\" said the messenger, interrogatively,\r\nholding out the yellow envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" responded Mr. Whittier, a tall, handsome old gentleman, taking\r\nthe telegram. \"You sign, Paul.\"\r\n\r\nThe youngest of the three, looking like his father, took the\r\nmessenger's book, and, glancing at an old-fashioned clock which stood\r\nin the corner, he wrote the name of the firm and the hour of delivery.\r\nHe was watching the messenger go out. His attention was suddenly called\r\nto subjects of more importance by a sharp exclamation from his father.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, well,\" said the elder Whittier with his eyes fixed on the\r\ntelegram he had just read. \"This is very strange--very strange indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"What's strange?\" asked the third occupant of the office, Mr.\r\nWheatcroft, a short, stout, irascible-looking man with a shock of\r\ngrizzly hair.\r\n\r\nFor all answer Mr. Whittier handed to Mr. Wheatcroft the thin slip of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the junior partner read the paper than he seemed angrier\r\nthan was usual with him.\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" he cried. \"I should think it was strange! confoundedly\r\nstrange--and deuced unpleasant, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I see what it is that's so very strange?\" asked Paul, picking up\r\nthe despatch.\r\n\r\n\"Of course you may see it,\" growled Mr. Wheatcroft; \"and let us see\r\nwhat you can make of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man read the message aloud: \"Deal off. Can get quarter cent\r\nbetter terms. Carkendale.\"\r\n\r\nThen he read it again to himself. At last he said, \"I confess I don't\r\nsee anything so very mysterious in that. We've lost a contract, I\r\nsuppose; but that must have happened lots of times before, hasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's happened twice before, this fall,\" returned Mr. Wheatcroft,\r\nfiercely, \"after our bid had been practically accepted and just before\r\nthe signing of the final contract!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me explain, Wheatcroft,\" interrupted the elder Whittier, gently.\r\n\"You must not expect my son to understand the ins and outs of this\r\nbusiness as we do. Besides, he has only been in the office ten days.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't expect him to understand,\" growled Wheatcroft. \"How could he?\r\nI don't understand it myself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Close that door, Paul,\" said Mr. Whittier. \"I don't want any of the\r\nclerks to know what we are talking about. Here are the facts in the\r\ncase, and I think you will admit that they are certainly curious: Twice\r\nthis fall, and now a third time, we have been the lowest bidders for\r\nimportant orders, and yet, just before our bid was formally accepted,\r\nsomebody has cut under us by a fraction of a cent and got the job.\r\nFirst we thought we were going to get the building of the Barataria\r\nCentral's bridge over the Little Makintosh River, but in the end it was\r\nthe Tuxedo Steel Company that got the contract. Then there was the\r\norder for the fifty thousand miles of wire for the Trans-continental\r\nTelegraph; we made an extraordinarily low estimate on that. We wanted\r\nthe contract, and we threw off, not only our profit, but even\r\nallowances for office expenses; and yet five minutes before the last\r\nbid had to be in, the Tuxedo Company put in an offer only a hundred and\r\ntwenty-five dollars less than ours. Now comes the telegram to-day. The\r\nMethuselah Life Insurance Company is going to put up a big building; we\r\nwere asked to estimate on the steel framework. We wanted that\r\nwork--times are hard and there is little doing, as you know, and we\r\nmust get work for our men if we can. We meant to have this contract if\r\nwe could. We offered to do it at what was really actual cost of\r\nmanufacture--without profit, first of all, and then without any charge\r\nat all for office expenses, for interest on capital, for depreciation\r\nof plant. The vice-president of the Methuselah, the one who attends to\r\nall their real estate, is Mr. Carkendale. He told me yesterday that our\r\nbid was very low, and that we were certain to get the contract. And now\r\nhe sends me this.\" Mr. Whittier picked up the telegram again.\r\n\r\n\"But if we were going to do it at actual cost of manufacture,\" said the\r\nyoung man, \"and somebody else underbids us, isn't somebody else losing\r\nmoney on the job?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's no sort of satisfaction to our men,\" retorted Mr. Wheatcroft,\r\ncooking himself before the fire. \"Somebody else--confound him!--will be\r\nable to keep his men together and to give them the wages we want for\r\nour men. Do you think somebody else is the Tuxedo Company again?\"\r\n\r\n\"What of it?\" asked Mr. Whittier. \"Surely you don't suppose----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" interrupted Mr. Wheatcroft, swiftly. \"I do, indeed. I\r\nhaven't been in this business thirty years for nothing. I know how\r\nhungry we get at all times for a big, fat contract; and I know we would\r\nany of us give a hundred dollars to the man who could tell us what our\r\nchief rival has bid. It would be the cheapest purchase of the year,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Wheatcroft,\" said the elder Whittier; \"you know we've\r\nnever done anything of that sort yet, and I think you and I are too old\r\nto be tempted now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" snorted the fiery little man; \"I'm open to\r\ntemptation this very moment. If I could know what the Tuxedo people are\r\ngoing to bid on the new steel rails of the Springfield and Athens, I'd\r\ngive a thousand dollars.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I understand you, Mr. Wheatcroft,\" Paul Whittier asked, \"you are\r\nsuggesting that there has been something done that is not fair?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I mean,\" Mr. Wheatcroft declared, vehemently.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say that the Tuxedo people have somehow been made\r\nacquainted with our bids?\" asked the young man.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I'm thinking now,\" was the sharp answer. \"I can't think of\r\nanything else. For two months we haven't been successful in getting a\r\nsingle one of the big contracts. We've had our share of the little\r\nthings, of course, but they don't amount to much. The big things that\r\nwe really wanted have slipped through our fingers. We've lost them by\r\nthe skin of our teeth every time. That isn't accident, is it? Of course\r\nnot! Then there's only one explanation--there's a leak in this office\r\nsomewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't suspect any of the clerks, do you, Mr. Wheatcroft?\" asked\r\nthe elder Whittier, sadly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't suspect anybody in particular,\" returned the junior partner,\r\nbrushing his hair up the wrong way; \"and I suspect everybody in\r\ngeneral. I haven't an idea who it is, but it's somebody! It must be\r\nsomebody--and if it is somebody, I'll do my best to get that somebody\r\ninto the clutches of the law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who makes up the bids on these important contracts?\" asked Paul.\r\n\r\n\"Wheatcroft and I,\" answered his father. \"The specifications are\r\nforwarded to the works, and the engineers make their estimates of the\r\nactual cost of labor and material. These estimates are sent to us here,\r\nand we add whatever we think best for interest, and for expenses, for\r\nwear and tear, and for profit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who writes the letters making the offer--the one with actual figures I\r\nmean?\" the son continued.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" the elder Whittier explained; \"I have always done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't dictate them to a typewriter?\" Paul pursued.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not,\" the father responded; \"I write them with my own hand,\r\nand, what's more, I take the press-copy myself, and there is a special\r\nletter-book for such things. This letter-book is always kept in the\r\nsafe in this office; in fact, I can say that this particular\r\nletter-book never leaves my hands except to go into that safe. And, as\r\nyou know, nobody has access to that safe except Wheatcroft and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Major,\" corrected the junior partner.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Mr. Whittier explained, \"Van Zandt has no need to go there now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he used to,\" Mr. Wheatcroft persisted.\r\n\r\n\"He did once,\" the senior partner returned; \"but when we bought those\r\nnew safes outside there in the main office, there was no longer any\r\nneed for the chief book-keeper to go to this smaller safe; and so, last\r\nmonth--it was while you were away, Wheatcroft--Van Zandt came in here\r\none afternoon, and said that, as he never had occasion to go to this\r\nsafe, he would rather not have the responsibility of knowing the\r\ncombination. I told him we had perfect confidence in him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so!\" broke in the explosive Wheatcroft. \"The Major has\r\nbeen with us for thirty years now. I'd suspect myself of petty larceny\r\nas soon as him.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I said,\" continued the elder Whittier; \"I told him that we trusted\r\nhim perfectly, of course. But he urged me, and to please him I changed\r\nthe combination of this safe that afternoon. You will remember,\r\nWheatcroft, that I gave you the new word the day you came back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember,\" said Mr. Wheatcroft. \"But I don't see why the Major\r\ndid not want to know how to open that safe. Perhaps he is beginning to\r\nfeel his years now. He must be sixty, the Major; and I've been thinking\r\nfor some time that he looks worn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I noticed the change in him,\" Paul remarked, \"the first day I came\r\ninto the office. He seemed ten years older than he was last winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps his wound troubles him again,\" suggested Mr. Whittier.\r\n\"Whatever the reason, it is at his own request that he is now ignorant\r\nof the combination. No one knows that but Wheatcroft and I. The letters\r\nthemselves I wrote myself, and copied myself, and put them myself in\r\nthe envelopes I directed myself. I don't recall mailing them myself,\r\nbut I may have done that too. So you see that there can't be any\r\nfoundation for your belief, Wheatcroft, that somebody had access to our\r\nbids.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't believe anything else!\" cried Wheatcroft, impulsively. \"I\r\ndon't know how it was done--I'm not a detective--but it was done\r\nsomehow. And if it was done, it was done by somebody! And what I'd like\r\nto do is to catch that somebody in the act--that's all! I'd make it hot\r\nfor him!\"\r\n\r\n\"You would like to have him out at the Ramapo Works,\" said Paul,\r\nsmiling at the little man's violence, \"and put him under the\r\nsteam-hammer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I would,\" responded Mr. Wheatcroft. \"I would indeed! Putting a\r\nman under a steam-hammer may seem a cruel punishment, but I think it\r\nwould cure the fellow of any taste for prying into our business in the\r\nfuture.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it would get him out of the habit of living,\" the elder\r\nWhittier said, as the tall clock in the corner struck one. \"But don't\r\nlet's be so brutal. Let's go to lunch and talk the matter over quietly.\r\nI don't agree with your suspicion, Wheatcroft, but there may be\r\nsomething in it.\"\r\n\r\nFive minutes later Mr. Whittier, Mr. Wheatcroft, and the only son of\r\nthe senior partner left the glass-framed private office, and, walking\r\nleisurely through the long store, passed into the street.\r\n\r\nThey did not notice that the old book-keeper, Major Van Zandt, whose\r\nhigh desk was so placed that he could overlook the private office, had\r\nbeen watching them ever since the messenger had delivered the despatch.\r\nHe could not read the telegram, he could not hear the comments, but he\r\ncould see every movement and every gesture and every expression. He\r\ngazed from one speaker to the other almost as though he were able to\r\nfollow the course of the discussion; and when the three members of the\r\nfirm walked past his desk, he found himself staring at them as if in a\r\nvain effort to read on their faces the secret of the course of action\r\nthey had resolved upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAfter luncheon, as it happened, both the senior and the junior partner\r\nof Whittier, Wheatcroft & Co. had to attend meetings, and they went\r\ntheir several ways, leaving Paul to return to the office alone.\r\n\r\nWhen he came opposite to the house which bore the weather-beaten sign\r\nof the firm he stood still for a moment, and looked across with mingled\r\npride and affection. The building was old-fashioned--so old-fashioned,\r\nindeed, that only a long-established firm could afford to occupy it. It\r\nwas Paul Whittier's great-grandfather who had founded the Ramapo Works.\r\nThere had been cast the cannon for many of the ships of the little\r\nAmerican navy that gave so good an account of itself in the war of\r\n1812. Again, in 1848, had the house of Whittier, Wheatcroft & Co.--the\r\npresent Mr. Wheatcroft's father having been taken into partnership by\r\nPaul's grandfather--been able to be of service to the government of the\r\nUnited States. All through the four years that followed the firing on\r\nthe flag in 1861 the Ramapo Works had been run day and night. When\r\npeace came at last and the people had leisure to expand, a large share\r\nof the rails needed by the new overland roads which were to bind the\r\nEast and West together in iron bonds had been rolled by Whittier,\r\nWheatcroft & Co. Of late years, as Paul knew, the old firm seemed to\r\nhave lost some of its early energy, and, having young and vigorous\r\ncompetitors, it had barely held its own.\r\n\r\nThat the Ramapo Works should once more take the lead was Paul Whittier's\r\nsolemn purpose, and to this end he had been carefully trained. He was\r\nnow a young man of twenty-five, a tall, handsome fellow, with a full\r\nmustache over his firm mouth, and with clear, quick eyes below his\r\ncurly brown hair. He had spent four years in college, carrying off\r\nhonors in mathematics, was popular with his classmates, who made him\r\nclass poet, and in his senior year he was elected president of the\r\ncollege photographic society. He had gone to a technological institute,\r\nwhere he had made himself master of the theory and practice of\r\nmetallurgy. After a year of travel in Europe, where he had investigated\r\nall the important steel and iron works he could get into, he had come\r\nhome to take a desk in the office.\r\n\r\nIt was only for a moment that he stood on the sidewalk opposite,\r\nlooking at the old building. Then he threw away his cigarette and went\r\nover. Instead of entering the long store he walked down the alleyway\r\nleft open for the heavy wagons. When he came opposite to the private\r\noffice in the rear of the store he examined the doors and the windows\r\ncarefully, to see if he could detect any means of ingress other than\r\nthose open to everybody.\r\n\r\nThere was no door from the private office into the alleyway or into the\r\nyard. There was a door from the alleyway into the store, opposite to\r\nthe desks of the clerks, and within a few feet of the door leading from\r\nthe store into the private office.\r\n\r\nPaul passed through this entrance, and found himself face to face with\r\nthe old book-keeper, Van Zandt, who was following all his movements\r\nwith a questioning gaze.\r\n\r\n\"Good-afternoon, Major,\" said Paul, pleasantly. \"Have you been out for\r\nyour lunch yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I always get my dinner at noon,\" the book-keeper gruffly answered,\r\nreturning to his books.\r\n\r\nAs Paul walked on he could not but think that the Major's manner was\r\nungracious. And the young man remembered how cheerful the old man had\r\nbeen, and how courteous always, when the son of the senior partner,\r\nwhile still a school-boy, used to come to the office on Saturdays.\r\n\r\nPaul had always delighted in the office, and the store, and the yard\r\nbehind, and he had spent many a holiday there, and Major Van Zandt had\r\nalways been glad to see him, and had willingly answered his myriad\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nPaul wondered why the book-keeper's manner was now so different. Van\r\nZandt was older, but he was not so very old, not more than sixty, and\r\nold age in itself is not sufficient to make a man surly and to sour his\r\ntemper. That the Major had had trouble in his family was well known.\r\nHis wife had been flighty and foolish, and it was believed that she had\r\nrun away from him; and his only son was a wild lad, who had been\r\nemployed by Whittier, Wheatcroft & Co., out of regard for the father,\r\nand who had disgraced himself beyond forgiveness. Paul recalled vaguely\r\nthat the young fellow had gone West somewhere, and had been shot in a\r\nmining-camp after a drunken brawl in a gambling-house.\r\n\r\nAs Paul entered the private office he found the porter there, putting\r\ncoal on the fire.\r\n\r\nStepping back to close the glass door behind him, that they might be\r\nalone, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Mike, who shuts up the office at night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I do, Mr. Paul,\" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n\"And you open it in the morning?\" the young man asked.\r\n\r\n\"I do that!\" Mike responded.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that these windows are always fastened on the inside?\" was\r\nthe next query.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Paul,\" the porter replied.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" and the inquirer hesitated briefly before putting this\r\nquestion, \"have you found any of these windows unfastened any morning\r\nlately when you came here?\"\r\n\r\n\"And how did you know that?\" Mike returned, in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"What morning was it?\" asked Paul, pushing his advantage.\r\n\r\n\"It was last Monday mornin', Mr. Paul,\" the porter explained, \"an' how\r\nit was I dunno, for I had every wan of them windows tight on Saturday\r\nnight, an' Monday mornin' one of them was unfastened whin I wint to\r\nopen it to let a bit of air into the office here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sleep here always, don't you?\" Paul proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"I've slept here ivery night for three years now come Thanksgivin',\"\r\nMike replied. \"I've the whole top of the house to myself. It's an\r\nilligant apartment I have there, Mr. Paul.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was here Sunday?\" was the next question.\r\n\r\n\"Sure nobody was here at all,\" responded the porter, \"barrin' they came\r\nwhile I took me a bit of a walk after dinner. An' they couldn't have\r\ngot in anyway, for I lock up always, and I wasn't gone for an hour, or\r\nmaybe an hour an' a half.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will be very careful hereafter,\" said Paul.\r\n\r\n\"I will that,\" promised Mike, \"an' I am careful now always.\"\r\n\r\nThe porter took up the coal-scuttle, and then he turned to Paul.\r\n\r\n\"How was it ye knew that the winder was not fastened that mornin'?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"How did I know?\" repeated the young man. \"Oh, a little bird told me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mike had left the office Paul took a chair before the fire and\r\nlighted a cigar. For half an hour he sat silently thinking.\r\n\r\nHe came to the conclusion that Mr. Wheatcroft was right in his\r\nsuspicion. Whittier, Wheatcroft & Co. had lost important contracts\r\nbecause of underbidding, due to knowledge surreptitiously obtained. He\r\nbelieved that some one had got into the store on Sunday while Mike was\r\ntaking a walk, and that this somebody had somehow opened the safe.\r\nThere never was any money in that private safe; it was intended to\r\ncontain only important papers. It did contain the letter-book of the\r\nfirm's bids, and this is what was wanted by the man who had got into\r\nthe office, and who had let himself in by the window, leaving it\r\nunfastened behind him. How this man had got in, and why he did not get\r\nout by the way he entered, how he came to be able to open the private\r\nsafe, the combination of which was known only to the two\r\npartners--these were questions for which Paul Whittier had no answer.\r\n\r\nWhat grieved him when he had come to the conclusion was that the\r\nthief--for such the house-breaker was in reality--was probably one of\r\nthe men in the employ of the firm. It seemed to him almost certain that\r\nthe man who had broken in knew all the ins and outs of the office. And\r\nhow could this knowledge have been obtained except by an employee? Paul\r\nwas well acquainted with the clerks in the outer office. There were\r\nfive of them, including the old book-keeper, and although none of them\r\nhad been with the firm as long as the Major, no one of them had been\r\nthere less than ten years. Paul did not know which one to suspect.\r\nThere was, in fact, no reason to suspect any particular clerk. And yet\r\nthat one of the five men in the main office on the other side of the\r\nglass partition within twenty feet of him--that one of those was the\r\nguilty man Paul did not doubt.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore it seemed to him not so important to prevent the thing\r\nfrom happening again as it was to catch the man who had done it. The\r\nthief once caught, it would be easy thereafter for the firm to take\r\nunusual precautions. But the first thing to do was to catch the thief.\r\nHe had come and gone, and left no trail. But he must have visited the\r\noffice at least three times in the past few weeks, since the firm had\r\nlost three important contracts. Probably he had been there oftener than\r\nthree times. Certainly he would come again. Sooner or later he would\r\ncome once too often. All that needed to be done was to set a trap for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhile Paul was sitting quietly in the private office, smoking a cigar\r\nwith all his mental faculties at their highest tension, the clock in\r\nthe corner suddenly struck three.\r\n\r\nPaul swiftly swung around in his chair and looked at it. An old\r\neight-day clock it was, which not only told the time of the day, but\r\npretended, also, to supply miscellaneous astronomical information. It\r\nstood by itself in the corner.\r\n\r\nFor a moment after it struck Paul stared at it with a fixed gaze, as\r\nthough he did not see what he was looking at. Then a light came into\r\nhis eyes and a smile flitted across his lips.\r\n\r\nHe turned around slowly and measured with his eye the proportions of\r\nthe room, the distance between the desks and the safe and the clock. He\r\nglanced up at the sloping glass roof above him. Then he smiled again,\r\nand again sat silent for a minute. He rose to his feet and stood with\r\nhis back to the fire. Almost in front of him was the clock in the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nHe took out his watch and compared its time with that of the clock.\r\nApparently he found that the clock was too fast, for he walked over to\r\nit and turned the minute-hand back. It seemed that this was a more\r\ndifficult feat than he supposed or that he went about it carelessly,\r\nfor the minute-hand broke off short in his fingers. A spasmodic\r\nmovement of his, as the thin metal snapped, pulled the chain off its\r\ncylinder, and the weight fell with a crash.\r\n\r\nAll the clerks looked up; and the red-headed office-boy was prompt in\r\nanswer to the bell Paul rang a moment after.\r\n\r\n\"Bobby,\" said the young man to the boy, as he took his hat and\r\novercoat, \"I've just broken the clock. I know a shop where they make a\r\nspecialty of repairing timepieces like that. I'm going to tell them to\r\nsend for it at once. Give it to the man who will come this afternoon\r\nwith my card. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cert,\" the boy answered. \"If he 'ain't got your card, he don't get the\r\nclock.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I mean,\" Paul responded, as he left the office.\r\n\r\nBefore he reached the door he met Mr. Wheatcroft.\r\n\r\n\"Paul,\" cried the junior partner, explosively, \"I've been thinking\r\nabout that--about that--you know what I mean! And I have decided that\r\nwe had better put a detective on this thing at once!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Paul, \"that's a good idea. In fact, I had just come to the\r\nsame conclusion. I----\"\r\n\r\nThen he checked himself. He had turned round slightly to speak to Mr.\r\nWheatcroft; he saw that Major Van Zandt was standing within ten feet of\r\nthem, and he noticed that the old book-keeper's face was strangely\r\npale.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDuring the next week the office of Whittier, Wheatcroft & Co. had its\r\nusual aspect of prosperous placidity. The routine work was done in the\r\nroutine way; the porter opened the office every morning, and the\r\noffice-boy arrived a few minutes after it was opened; the clerks came\r\nat nine, and a little later the partners were to be seen in the inner\r\noffice reading the morning's correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe Whittiers, father and son, had had a discussion with Mr. Wheatcroft\r\nas to the most advisable course to adopt to prevent the future leakage\r\nof the trade secrets of the firm. The senior partner had succeeded in\r\ndissuading the junior partner from the employment of detectives.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" he said, \"not yet. These clerks have all served us\r\nfaithfully for years, and I don't want to submit them to the indignity\r\nof being shadowed--that's what they call it, isn't it?--of being\r\nshadowed by some cheap hireling who may try to distort the most\r\ninnocent acts into evidence of guilt, so that he can show us how smart\r\nhe is.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this sort of thing can't go on forever,\" ejaculated Mr.\r\nWheatcroft. \"If we are to be underbid on every contract worth having,\r\nwe might as well go out of the business!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true, of course,\" Mr. Whittier admitted; \"but we are not sure\r\nthat we are being underbid unfairly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Tuxedo Company have taken away three contracts from us in the past\r\ntwo months,\" cried the junior partner; \"we can be sure of that, can't\r\nwe?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have lost three contracts, of course,\" returned Mr. Whittier, in\r\nhis most conciliatory manner, \"and the Tuxedo people have captured\r\nthem. But that may be only a coincidence, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a pretty expensive coincidence for us,\" snorted Mr. Wheatcroft.\r\n\r\n\"But because we have lost money,\" the senior partner rejoined gently,\r\nlaying his hand on Mr. Wheatcroft's arm, \"that's no reason why we\r\nshould also lose our heads. It is no reason why we should depart from\r\nour old custom of treating every man fairly. If there is any one in our\r\nemploy here who is selling us, why, if we give him rope enough he will\r\nhang himself, sooner or later.\"\r\n\r\n\"And before he suspends himself that way,\" cried Mr. Wheatcroft, \"we\r\nmay be forced to suspend ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Wheatcroft,\" said the senior partner, \"I think we can\r\nafford to stand the loss a little longer. What we can't afford to do is\r\nto lose our self-respect by doing something irreparable. It may be that\r\nwe shall have to employ detectives, but I don't think the time has come\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" the junior partner declared, yielding an unwilling\r\nconsent. \"I don't insist on it. I still think it would be best not to\r\nwaste any more time--but I don't insist. What will happen is that we\r\nshall lose the rolling of those steel rails for the Springfield and\r\nAthens road--that's all.\"\r\n\r\nPaul Whittier had taken no part in this discussion. He agreed with his\r\nfather, and saw he had no need to urge any further argument.\r\n\r\nPresently he asked when they intended to put in the bid for the rails.\r\nHis father then explained that they were expecting a special estimate\r\nfrom the engineers at the Ramapo Works, and that it probably would be\r\nSaturday before this could be discussed by the partners and the exact\r\nfigures of the proposed contract determined.\r\n\r\n\"And if we don't want to lose that contract for sure,\" insisted Mr.\r\nWheatcroft, \"I think we had better change the combination on that\r\nsafe.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I suggest,\" said Paul, \"that it seems to me to be better to leave\r\nthe combination as it is. What we want to do is not to get this\r\nSpringfield and Athens contract so much as to find out whether some one\r\nreally is getting at the letter-book. Therefore we mustn't make it any\r\nharder for the some one to get at the letter-book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well,\" Mr. Wheatcroft assented, a little ungraciously, \"have\r\nit your own way. But I want you to understand now that I think you are\r\nonly postponing the inevitable!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that the subject was dropped. For several days the three men\r\nwho were together for hours in the office of the Ramapo Iron and Steel\r\nWorks refrained from any discussion of the question which was most\r\nprominent in their minds.\r\n\r\nIt was on Wednesday that the tall clock that Paul Whittier had broken\r\nreturned from the repairer's. Paul himself helped the men to set it in\r\nits old place in the corner of the office, facing the safe, which\r\noccupied the corner diagonally opposite.\r\n\r\nIt so chanced that Paul came down late on Thursday morning, and perhaps\r\nthis was the reason that a pressure of delayed work kept him in the\r\noffice that evening long after every one else. The clerks had all gone,\r\neven Major Van Zandt, always the last to leave--and the porter had come\r\nin twice before the son of the senior partner was ready to go for the\r\nnight. The gas was lighted here and there in the long, narrow, deserted\r\nstore, as Paul walked through it from the office to the street.\r\nOpposite, the swift twilight of a New York November had already settled\r\ndown on the city.\r\n\r\n\"Can't I carry yer bag for ye, Mister Paul?\" asked the porter, who was\r\nshowing him out.\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, Mike,\" was the young man's answer. \"That bag has very\r\nlittle in it. And, besides, I haven't got to carry it far.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning Paul was the first of the three to arrive. The clerks\r\nwere in their places already, but neither the senior nor the junior\r\npartner had yet come. The porter happened to be standing under the\r\nwagon archway as Paul Whittier was about to enter the store.\r\n\r\nThe young man saw the porter, and a mischievous smile hovered about the\r\ncorners of his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Mike,\" he said, pausing on the door-step, \"do you think you ought to\r\nsmoke while you are cleaning out our office in the morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I haven't had me pipe in me mouth this mornin' at all,\" the\r\nporter answered, taken by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"But yesterday morning?\" Paul pursued.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday mornin'!\" Mike echoed, not a little puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday morning at ten minutes before eight you were in the private\r\noffice smoking a pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you see me, Mr. Paul?\" cried Mike, in amaze. \"Ye was late\r\nin comin' down yesterday, wasn't ye?\"\r\n\r\nPaul smiled pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\"A little bird told me,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"If I had the bird I'd ring his neck for tellin' tales,\" the porter\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind your smoking, Mike,\" the young man went on, \"that's your\r\nown affair; but I'd rather you didn't smoke a pipe while you are\r\ntidying up the private office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mister Paul, I won't do it again,\" the porter promised.\r\n\r\n\"And I wouldn't encourage Bob to smoke, either,\" Paul continued.\r\n\r\n\"I encourage him?\" inquired Mike.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Paul explained; \"yesterday morning you let him light his\r\ncigarette from your pipe--didn't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you peekin' in thro' the winder, Mister Paul?\" the porter asked,\r\neagerly. \"Ye saw me, an' I never saw ye at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the young man answered, \"I can't say that I saw you myself. A\r\nlittle bird told me.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that he left the wondering porter and entered the store. Just\r\ninside the door was the office-boy, who hastily hid an unlighted\r\ncigarette as he caught sight of the senior partner's son.\r\n\r\nWhen Paul saw the red-headed boy he smiled again, mischievously.\r\n\r\n\"Bob,\" he began, \"when you want to see who can stand on his head the\r\nlongest, you or Danny the boot-black, don't you think you could choose\r\na better place than the private office?\"\r\n\r\nThe office-boy was quite as much taken by surprise as the porter had\r\nbeen, but he was younger and quicker-witted.\r\n\r\n\"And when did I have Danny in the office?\" he asked, defiantly.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday morning,\" Paul answered, still smiling, \"a little before\r\nhalf-past eight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday mornin'?\" repeated Bob, as though trying hard to recall all\r\nthe events of the day before. \"Maybe Danny did come in for a minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"He played leap-frog with you all the way into the private office,\"\r\nPaul went on, while Bob looked at him with increasing wonder.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know?\" the office-boy asked, frankly. \"Were you lookin'\r\nthrough the window?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I know that you and Danny stood on your heads in the corner of\r\nthe office with your heels against the safe, scratching off the paint?\r\nNext time I'd try the yard, if I were you. Sports of that sort are more\r\nfun in the open air.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with that parting shot Paul went on his way to his own desk,\r\nleaving the office-boy greatly puzzled.\r\n\r\nLater in the day Bob and Mike exchanged confidences, and neither was\r\nready with an explanation.\r\n\r\n\"At school,\" Bob declared, \"we used to think teacher had eyes in the\r\nback of her head. She was everlastingly catchin' me when I did things\r\nbehind her back. But Mr. Paul beats that, for he see me doin' things\r\nwhen he wasn't here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mister Paul wasn't here, for sure, yesterday mornin',\" Mike asserted;\r\n\"I'd take me oath o' that. An' if he wasn't here, how could he see me\r\ngivin' ye a light from me pipe? Answer me that! He says it's a little\r\nbird told him; but that's not it, I'm thinkin'. Not but that they have\r\nclocks with birds into 'em, that come out and tell the time o' day,\r\n'Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!' An' if that big clock he broke last week had\r\na bird in it that could tell time that way, I'd break the thing\r\nquick--so I would.\"\r\n\r\n\"It ain't no bird,\" said Bob. \"You can bet your life on that. No birds\r\ncan't tell him nothin' no more'n you can catch 'em by putting salt on\r\ntheir tails. I know what it is Mr. Paul does--least, I know how he does\r\nit. It's second-sight, that's what it is! I see a man onct at the\r\ntheayter, an' he----\"\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it is not necessary to set down here the office-boy's\r\nrecollection of the trick of an ingenious magician.\r\n\r\nAbout half an hour after Paul had arrived at the office Mr. Wheatcroft\r\nappeared. The junior partner hesitated in the doorway for a second, and\r\nthen entered.\r\n\r\nPaul was watching him, and the same mischievous smile flashed over the\r\nface of the young man.\r\n\r\n\"You need not be alarmed to-day, Mr. Wheatcroft,\" he said. \"There is no\r\nfascinating female waiting for you this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound the woman!\" ejaculated Mr. Wheatcroft, testily. \"I couldn't\r\nget rid of her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you subscribed for the book at last,\" asserted Paul, \"and she went\r\naway happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I did agree to take one copy of the work she showed me,\"\r\nadmitted Mr. Wheatcroft, a little sheepishly. Then he looked up\r\nsuddenly. \"Why, bless my soul,\" he cried, \"that was yesterday\r\nmorning----\"\r\n\r\n\"Allowing for differences of clocks,\" Paul returned, \"it was about ten\r\nminutes to ten yesterday morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you come to know anything about it? I should like to be\r\ntold that!\" the junior partner inquired. \"You did not get down till\r\nnearly twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had an eye on you,\" Paul answered, as the smile again flitted across\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you were detained all the morning by a sick friend,\"\r\ninsisted Mr. Wheatcroft.\r\n\r\n\"So I was,\" Paul responded. \"And if you won't believe I had an eye on\r\nyou, all I can say then is that a little bird told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" cried Mr. Wheatcroft. \"Your little bird has two\r\nlegs, hasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most birds have,\" laughed Paul.\r\n\r\n\"I mean two legs in a pair of trousers,\" explained the junior partner,\r\nrumpling his grizzled hair with an impatient gesture.\r\n\r\n\"You see how uncomfortable it is to be shadowed,\" said Paul, turning\r\nthe topic as his father entered the office.\r\n\r\nThat Saturday afternoon Mr. Whittier and Mr. Wheatcroft agreed on the\r\nbid to be made on the steel rails needed by the Springfield and Athens\r\nroad. While the elder Mr. Whittier wrote the letter to the railroad\r\nwith his own hand, his son manoeuvred the junior partner into the\r\nouter office, where all the clerks happened to be at work, including\r\nthe old book-keeper. Then Paul managed his conversation with Mr.\r\nWheatcroft so that any one of the five employees who chose to listen to\r\nthe apparently careless talk should know that the firm had just made a\r\nbid on another important contract. Paul also spoke as though his father\r\nand himself would probably go out of town that Saturday night, to\r\nremain away till Monday morning.\r\n\r\nAnd just before the store was closed for the night, Paul Whittier wound\r\nup the eight-day clock that stood in the corner opposite the private\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAlthough the Whittiers, father and son, spent Sunday out of town, Paul\r\nmade an excuse to the friends whom they were visiting, and returned to\r\nthe city by a midnight train. Thus he was enabled to present himself at\r\nthe office of the Ramapo Works very early on Monday morning.\r\n\r\nIt was so early, indeed, that no one of the employees had arrived when\r\nthe son of the senior partner, bag in hand, pushed open the street door\r\nand entered the long store, at the far end of which the porter was\r\nstill tidying up for the day's work.\r\n\r\n\"An' is that you, Mister Paul?\" Mike asked in surprise, as he came out\r\nof the private office to see who the early visitor might be. \"An' what\r\nbrought ye out o' your bed before breakfast like this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I always get out of bed before breakfast,\" Paul replied. \"Don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would I get up if I hadn't got to get up to get my livin'?\" the porter\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\nPaul entered the office, followed by Mike, still wondering why the\r\nyoung man was there at that hour.\r\n\r\nAfter a swift glance round the office Paul put down his bag on the\r\ntable and turned suddenly to the porter with a question.\r\n\r\n\"When does Bob get down here?\"\r\n\r\nMike looked at the clock in the corner before answering.\r\n\r\n\"It'll be ten minutes,\" he said, \"or maybe twenty, before the boy does\r\nbe here to-day, seein' it's Monday mornin', an' he'll be tired with not\r\nworkin' of Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten minutes,\" repeated Paul, slowly. After a moment's thought he\r\ncontinued, \"Then I'll have to ask you to go out for me, Mike.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can go anywhere ye want, Mister Paul,\" the porter responded.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to go----\" began Paul, \"I want you to go----\" and he\r\nhesitated, as though he was not quite sure what it was he wished the\r\nporter to do, \"I want you to go to the office of the _Gotham Gazette_\r\nand get me two copies of yesterday's paper. Do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they won't be open so early in the mornin',\" said the Irishman.\r\n\r\n\"That's no matter,\" said Paul, hastily correcting himself; \"I mean that\r\nI want you to go there now and get the papers if you can. Of course, if\r\nthe office isn't open I shall have to send again later.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be goin' now, Mister Paul,\" and Mike took his hat from a chair\r\nand started off at once.\r\n\r\nPaul walked through the store with the porter. When Mike had gone the\r\nyoung man locked the front door and returned at once to the private\r\noffice in the rear. He shut himself in, and lowered all the shades so\r\nthat whatever he might do inside could not be seen by any one on the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was he wished to do he was able to do it swiftly, for in\r\nless than a minute after he had closed the door of the office he opened\r\nit again and came out into the main store with his bag in his hand. He\r\nwalked leisurely to the front of the store, arriving just in time to\r\nunlock the door as the office-boy came around the corner smoking a\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\nWhen Bob, still puffing steadily, was about to open the door and enter\r\nthe store he looked up and discovered that Paul was gazing at him. The\r\nboy pinched the cigarette out of his mouth and dropped it outside, and\r\nthen came in, his eyes expressing his surprise at the presence of the\r\nsenior partner's son down-town at that early hour in the morning.\r\n\r\nPaul greeted the boy pleasantly, but Bob got away from him as soon as\r\npossible. Ever since the young man had told what had gone on in the\r\noffice when Bob was its only occupant, the office-boy was a little\r\nafraid of the young man, as though somewhat mysterious, not to say\r\nuncanny.\r\n\r\nPaul thought it best to wait for the porter's return, and he stood\r\noutside under the archway for five minutes, smoking a cigar, with his\r\nbag at his feet.\r\n\r\nWhen Mike came back with the two copies of the Sunday newspaper he had\r\nbeen sent to get, Paul gave him the money for them and an extra quarter\r\nfor himself. Then the young man picked up his bag again.\r\n\r\n\"When my father comes down, Mike,\" he said, \"tell him I may be a little\r\nlate in getting back this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"An' are ye goin' away now, Mister Paul?\" the porter asked. \"What good\r\nwas it that ye got out o' bed before breakfast and come down here so\r\nearly in the mornin'?\"\r\n\r\nPaul laughed a little. \"I had a reason for coming here this morning,\"\r\nhe answered, briefly; and with that he walked away, his bag in one hand\r\nand the two bulky, gaudy papers in the other.\r\n\r\nMike watched him turn the corner, and then went into the store again,\r\nwhere Bob greeted him promptly with the query why the old man's son had\r\nbeen getting up by the bright light.\r\n\r\n\"If I was the boss, or the boss's son either,\" said Bob, \"I wouldn't\r\nget up till I was good and ready. I'd have my breakfast in bed if I had\r\na mind to, an' my dinner too, an' my supper. An' I wouldn't do no work,\r\nan' I'd go to the theayter every night, and twice on Saturdays.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dunno why Mister Paul was down,\" Mike explained. \"All he wanted was\r\ntwo o' thim Sunday papers with pictures in thim. What did he want two\r\no' thim for I dunno. There's reading enough in one o' thim to last me a\r\nmonth of Sundays.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be surmised that Mike would have been still more in the dark as\r\nto Paul Whittier's reasons for coming down-town so early that Monday\r\nmorning if he could have seen the young man throw the copies of the\r\n_Gotham Gazette_ into the first ash-cart he passed after he was out of\r\nrange of the porter's vision.\r\n\r\nPaul was not the only member of Whittier, Wheatcroft & Co. to arrive at\r\nthe office early that morning. Mr. Wheatcroft was usually punctual,\r\ntaking his seat at his desk just as the clock struck half-past nine. On\r\nthis Monday morning he entered the store a little before nine.\r\n\r\nAs he walked back to the office he looked over at the desks of the\r\nclerks as though he was seeking some one.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the office he met Bob.\r\n\r\n\"Hasn't the Major come down yet?\" he asked, shortly.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" the boy answered. \"He don't never get here till nine.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm,\" grunted the junior partner. \"When he does come, tell him I want\r\nto see him at once--at once, do you understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't deaf and dumb and blind,\" Bob responded. \"I'll steer him into\r\nyou as soon as ever he shows up.\"\r\n\r\nBut, for a wonder, the old book-keeper was late that morning.\r\nOrdinarily he was a model of exactitude. Yet the clock struck nine, and\r\nhalf-past, and ten before he appeared in the store.\r\n\r\nBefore he changed his coat Bob was at his side.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wheatcroft he wants to see you now in a hurry,\" said the boy.\r\n\r\nMajor Van Zandt paled swiftly, and steadied himself by a grasp of the\r\nrailing.\r\n\r\n\"Does Mr. Wheatcroft wish to see me?\" he asked, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"You bet he does,\" the boy answered, \"an' in a hurry, too. He came\r\nbright an' early this morning a-purpose to see you, an' he's been\r\na-waiting for two hours. An' I guess he's got his mad up now.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the old book-keeper with his blanched face and his faltering step\r\nentered the private office Mr. Wheatcroft wheeled around in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's you, is it?\" he cried. \"At last!\"\r\n\r\n\"I regret that I was late this morning, Mr. Wheatcroft,\" Van Zandt\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n\"That's no matter,\" said the employer;--\"at least, I want to talk about\r\nsomething else.\"\r\n\r\n\"About something else?\" echoed the old man, feebly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" responded Mr. Wheatcroft. \"Shut the door behind you, please, so\r\nthat that red-headed cub out there can't hear what I am going to say,\r\nand take a chair. Yes; there is something else I've got to say to you,\r\nand I want you to be frank with me.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever it was that Mr. Wheatcroft had to say to Major Van Zandt it\r\nhad to be said under the eyes of the clerks on the other side of the\r\nglass partition. And it took a long time saying, for it was evident to\r\nany observer of the two men as they sat in the private office that Mr.\r\nWheatcroft was trying to force an explanation of some kind from the old\r\nbook-keeper, and that the Major was resisting his employer's entreaties\r\nas best he could. Apparently the matter under discussion was of an\r\nimportance so grave as to make Mr. Wheatcroft resolutely retain his\r\nself-control; and not once did he let his voice break out explosively,\r\nas was his custom.\r\n\r\nMajor Van Zandt was still closeted with Wheatcroft when Mr. Whittier\r\narrived. The senior partner stopped near the street door to speak to a\r\nclerk, and he was joined almost immediately by his son.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Paul,\" said the father, \"have I got down here before you after\r\nall, and in spite of your running away last night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the son responded, \"I was the first to arrive this\r\nmorning--luckily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Luckily?\" echoed his father. \"I suppose that means that you have been\r\nable to accomplish your purpose--whatever it was. You didn't tell me,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm ready to tell you now, father,\" said Paul, \"since I have\r\nsucceeded.\"\r\n\r\nWalking down the store together, they came to the private office.\r\n\r\nAs the old book-keeper saw them he started up, and made as if to leave\r\nthe office.\r\n\r\n\"Keep your seat, Major,\" cried Mr. Wheatcroft, sternly, but not\r\nunkindly. \"Keep your seat, please.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Mr. Whittier. \"I have something to tell you both,\"\r\nhe said, \"and I want the Major here while I tell you. Paul, may I\r\ntrouble you to see that the door is closed so that we are out of\r\nhearing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" Paul responded, as he closed the door.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Wheatcroft,\" Mr. Whittier said, \"what is all this mystery of\r\nyours now?\"\r\n\r\nThe junior partner swung around in his chair and faced Mr. Whittier.\r\n\r\n\"My mystery?\" he cried. \"It's the mystery that puzzled us all, and I've\r\nsolved it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the senior partner.\r\n\r\n\"What I mean is, that somebody has been opening that safe there in the\r\ncorner, and reading our private letter-book, and finding out what we\r\nwere bidding on important contracts. What I mean is, that this man has\r\ntaken this information, filched from us, and sold it to our\r\ncompetitors, who were not too scrupulous to buy stolen goods!\"\r\n\r\n\"We all suspected this, as you know,\" the elder Whittier said; \"have\r\nyou anything new to add to it now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I?\" returned Mr. Wheatcroft. \"I've found the man! That's all!\"\r\n\r\n\"You, too?\" ejaculated Paul.\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\" asked the senior partner.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" Mr. Wheatcroft begged. \"Don't be in a hurry and I'll\r\ntell you. Yesterday afternoon, I don't know what possessed me, but I\r\nfelt drawn down-town for some reason. I wanted to see if anything was\r\ngoing on down here. I knew we had made that bid Saturday, and I\r\nwondered if anybody would try to get it on Sunday. So I came down about\r\nfour o'clock, and I saw a man sneak out of the front door of this\r\noffice. I followed him as swiftly as I could and as quietly, for I\r\ndidn't want to give the alarm until I knew more. The man did not see me\r\nas he turned to go up the steps of the elevated railroad station. At\r\nthe corner I saw his face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you recognize him?\" asked Mr. Whittier.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the answer. \"And he did not see me. There were tears rolling\r\ndown his cheeks, perhaps that's the reason. This morning I called him\r\nin here, and he has finally confessed the whole thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who--who is it?\" asked Mr. Whittier, dreading to look at the old\r\nbook-keeper, who had been in the employ of the firm for thirty years\r\nand more.\r\n\r\n\"It is Major Van Zandt!\" Mr. Wheatcroft declared.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence; then the voice of Paul Whittier was\r\nheard, saying, \"I think there is some mistake!\"\r\n\r\n\"A mistake!\" cried Mr. Wheatcroft. \"What kind of a mistake?\"\r\n\r\n\"A mistake as to the guilty man,\" responded Paul.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that the Major isn't guilty?\" asked Mr. Wheatcroft.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I mean,\" Paul returned.\r\n\r\n\"But he has confessed,\" Mr. Wheatcroft retorted.\r\n\r\n\"I can't help that,\" was the response. \"He isn't the man who opened\r\nthat safe yesterday afternoon at half-past three and took out the\r\nletter-book.\"\r\n\r\nThe old book-keeper looked at the young man in frightened amazement.\r\n\r\n\"I have confessed it,\" he said, piteously--\"I have confessed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you have, Major,\" Paul declared, not unkindly. \"And I don't\r\nknow why you have, for you were not the man.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if the man who confesses is not the man who did it, who is?\" asked\r\nWheatcroft, sarcastically.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know who is, although I have my suspicions,\" said Paul; \"but I\r\nhave his photograph--taken in the act!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWhen Paul Whittier said he had a photograph of the mysterious enemy of\r\nthe Ramapo Steel and Iron Works in the very act of opening the safe,\r\nMr. Whittier and Mr. Wheatcroft looked at each other in amazement.\r\nMajor Van Zandt stared at the young man with fear and shame struggling\r\ntogether in his face.\r\n\r\nWithout waiting to enjoy his triumph, Paul put his hand in his pocket\r\nand took out two squares of bluish paper.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" he said, as he handed one to his father, \"there is a blue\r\nprint of the man taken in this office at ten minutes past three\r\nyesterday afternoon, just as he was about to open the safe in the\r\ncorner. You see he is kneeling with his hand on the lock, but\r\napparently just then something alarmed him and he cast a hasty glance\r\nover his shoulder. At that second the photograph was taken, and so we\r\nhave a full-face portrait of the man.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whittier had looked at the photograph, and he now passed it to the\r\nimpatient hand of the junior partner.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Mr. Wheatcroft,\" Paul continued, \"that although the face in\r\nthe photograph bears a certain family likeness to Major Van Zandt's,\r\nall the same that is not a portrait of the Major. The man who was here\r\nyesterday was a young man, a man young enough to be the Major's son!\"\r\n\r\nThe old book-keeper looked at the speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Paul,\" he began, \"you won't be hard on the----\" then he paused\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\"I confess I don't understand this at all!\" declared Mr. Wheatcroft,\r\nirascibly.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that I do understand it,\" Mr. Whittier said, with a glance\r\nof compassion at the Major.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" Paul continued, handing his father a second azure square,\r\n\"there is a photograph taken here ten minutes after the first, at 3.20\r\nyesterday afternoon. That shows the safe open and the young man\r\nstanding before it with the private letter-book in his hand. As his\r\nhead is bent over the pages of the book, the view of the face is not so\r\ngood. But there can be no doubt that it is the same man. You see that,\r\ndon't you, Mr. Wheatcroft?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that, of course,\" returned Mr. Wheatcroft, forcibly. \"What I\r\ndon't see is why the Major here should confess if he isn't guilty!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I know the reason for that,\" said Mr. Whittier, gently.\r\n\r\n\"There haven't been two men at our books, have there?\" asked Mr.\r\nWheatcroft--\"the Major, and also the fellow who has been photographed?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whittier looked at the book-keeper for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Major,\" he said, with compassion in his voice, \"you won't tell me that\r\nit was you who sold our secrets to our rivals? And you might confess it\r\nagain and again, I should never believe it. I know you better. I have\r\nknown you too long to believe any charge against your honesty, even if\r\nyou bring it yourself. The real culprit, the man who is photographed\r\nhere, is your son, isn't he? There is no use in your trying to conceal\r\nthe truth now, and there is no need to attempt it, because we shall be\r\nlenient with him for your sake, Major.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's silence, broken by Wheatcroft suddenly saying:\r\n\r\n\"The Major's son? Why, he's dead, isn't he? He was shot in a brawl\r\nafter a spree somewhere out West two or three years ago--at least,\r\nthat's what I understood at the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is what I wanted everybody to understand at the time,\" said the\r\nbook-keeper, breaking silence at last. \"But it wasn't so. The boy was\r\nshot, but he wasn't killed. I hoped that it would be a warning to him,\r\nand he would make a fresh start. Friends of mine got him a place in\r\nMexico, but luck was against him--so he wrote me--and he lost that.\r\nThen an old comrade of mine gave him another chance out in Denver, and\r\nfor a while he kept straight and did his work well. Then he broke down\r\nonce more and he was discharged. For six months I did not know what had\r\nbecome of him. I've found out since that he was a tramp for weeks, and\r\nthat he walked most of the way from Colorado to New York. This fall he\r\nturned up in the city, ragged, worn out, sick. I wanted to order him\r\naway, but I couldn't. I took him back and got him decent clothes and\r\ntook him to look for a place, for I knew that hard work was the only\r\nthing that would keep him out of mischief. He did not find a place,\r\nperhaps he did not look for one. But all at once I discovered that he\r\nhad money. He would not tell me how he got it. I knew he could not have\r\ncome by it honestly, and so I watched him. I spied after him, and at\r\nlast I found that he was selling you to the Tuxedo Company.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how could he open the safe?\" cried Mr. Wheatcroft. \"You didn't\r\nknow the new combination.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not tell him the combination I did know,\" said the old\r\nbook-keeper, with pathetic dignity. \"And I didn't have to tell him. He\r\ncan open almost any safe without knowing the combination. How he does\r\nit, I don't know; it is his gift. He listens to the wheels as they\r\nturn, and he sets first one and then the other; and in ten minutes the\r\nsafe is open.\"\r\n\r\n\"How could he get into the store?\" Mr. Whittier inquired.\r\n\r\n\"He knew I had a key,\" responded the old book-keeper, \"and he stole it\r\nfrom me. He used to watch on Sunday afternoons till Mike went for a\r\nwalk, and then he unlocked the store, and slipped in and opened the\r\nsafe. Two weeks ago Mike came back unexpectedly, and he had just time\r\nto get out of one of the rear windows of this office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Paul remarked, as the Major paused, \"Mike told me that he found\r\na window unfastened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard you asking about it,\" Major Van Zandt explained, \"and I knew\r\nthat if you were suspicious he was sure to be caught sooner or later.\r\nSo I begged him not to try to injure you again. I offered him money to\r\ngo away. But he refused my money; he said he could get it for himself\r\nnow, and I might keep mine until he needed it. He gave me the slip\r\nyesterday afternoon. When I found he was gone I came here straight. The\r\nfront door was unlocked; I walked in and found him just closing the\r\nsafe here. I talked to him, and he refused to listen to me. I tried to\r\nget him to give up his idea, and he struck me. Then I left him, and I\r\nwent out, seeing no one as I hurried home. That's when Mr. Wheatcroft\r\nfollowed me, I suppose. The boy never came back all night. I haven't\r\nseen him since; I don't know where he is, but he is my son, after\r\nall--my only son! And when Mr. Wheatcroft accused me, I confessed at\r\nlast, thinking you might be easier on me than you would be on the boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"My poor friend,\" said Mr. Whittier, sympathetically, holding out his\r\nhand, which the Major clasped gratefully for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Now that we know who was selling us to the Tuxedo people, we can\r\nprotect ourselves hereafter,\" declared Mr. Wheatcroft. \"And in spite of\r\nyour trying to humbug me into believing you guilty, Major, I'm willing\r\nto let your son off easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I can get him a place where he will be out of temptation,\r\nbecause he will be kept hard at work always,\" said Paul.\r\n\r\nThe old book-keeper looked up as though about to thank the young man,\r\nbut there seemed to be a lump in his throat which prevented him from\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mr. Wheatcroft began, explosively, \"That's all very well! but\r\nwhat I still don't understand is how Paul got those photographs!\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whittier looked at his son and smiled. \"That is a little\r\nmysterious, Paul,\" he said, \"and I confess I'd like to know how you did\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you concealed here yourself?\" asked Mr. Wheatcroft.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Paul answered. \"If you will look round this room you will see\r\nthat there isn't a dark corner in which anybody could tuck himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then where was the photographer hidden?\" Mr. Wheatcroft inquired, with\r\nincreasing curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"In the clock,\" responded Paul.\r\n\r\n\"In the clock?\" echoed Mr. Wheatcroft, greatly amazed. \"Why, there\r\nisn't room in the case of that clock for a thin midget, let alone a\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\nPaul enjoyed puzzling his father's partner. \"I didn't say I had a man\r\nthere or a midget either,\" he explained. \"I said that the photographer\r\nwas in the clock--and I might have said that the clock itself was the\r\nphotographer.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wheatcroft threw up his hands in disgust. \"Well,\" he cried, \"if you\r\nwant to go on mystifying us in this absurd way, go on as long as you\r\nlike! But your father and I are entitled to some consideration, I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not mystifying you at all; the clock took the pictures\r\nautomatically. I'll show you how,\" Paul returned, getting up from his\r\nchair and going to the corner of the office.\r\n\r\nTaking a key from his pocket he opened the case of the clock and\r\nrevealed a small photographic apparatus inside, with the tube of the\r\nobjective opposite the round glass panel in the door of the case. At\r\nthe bottom of the case was a small electrical battery, and on a small\r\nshelf over this was an electro-magnet.\r\n\r\n\"I begin to see how you did it,\" Mr. Whittier remarked. \"I am not an\r\nexpert in photography, Paul, and I'd like a full explanation. And make\r\nit as simple as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a very simple thing indeed,\" said the son. \"One day while I was\r\nwondering how we could best catch the man who was getting at the books,\r\nthat clock happened to strike, and somehow it reminded me that in our\r\nphotographic society at college we had once suggested that it would be\r\namusing to attach a detective camera to a timepiece and take snapshots\r\nevery few minutes all through the day. I saw that this clock of ours\r\nfaced the safe, and that it couldn't be better placed for the purpose.\r\nSo when I had thought out my plan, I came over here and pretended that\r\nthe clock was wrong, and in setting it right I broke off the\r\nminute-hand. Then I had a man I know send for it for repairs; he is\r\nboth an electrician and an expert photographer. Together we worked out\r\nthis device. Here is a small snap-shot camera loaded with a hundred and\r\nfifty films; and here is the electrical attachment which connects with\r\nthe clock so as to take a photograph every ten minutes from eight in\r\nthe morning to six at night. We arranged that the magnet should turn\r\nthe spool of film after every snap-shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" cried Mr. Wheatcroft. \"I don't know much about these things,\r\nbut I read the papers, and I suppose you mean that the clock 'pressed\r\nthe button,' and the electricity pulled the string.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it precisely,\" the young man responded. \"Of course I wasn't\r\nquite sure how it would work, so I thought I would try it first on a\r\nweek-day when we were all here. It did work all right, and I made\r\nseveral interesting discoveries. I found that Mike smoked a pipe in\r\nthis office--and that Bob played leap-frog in the store and stood on\r\nhis head in the corner there up against the safe!\"\r\n\r\n\"The confounded young rascal!\" interrupted Mr. Wheatcroft.\r\n\r\nPaul smiled as he continued. \"I found also that Mr. Wheatcroft was\r\ncaptivated by a pretty book-agent and bought two bulky volumes he\r\ndidn't want.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wheatcroft looked sheepish for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's how you knew, is it?\" he growled, running his hands\r\nimpatiently through his shock of hair.\r\n\r\n\"That's how I knew,\" Paul replied. \"I told you I had an eye on you. It\r\nwas the lone eye of the camera. And on Sunday it kept watch for us\r\nhere, winking every ten minutes. From eight o'clock in the morning to\r\nthree in the afternoon it winked forty-two times, and all it saw was\r\nthe same scene, the empty corner of the room here, with the safe in the\r\nshadow at first and at last in the full light that poured down from the\r\nglass roof over us. But a little after three a man came into the office\r\nand made ready to open the safe. At ten minutes past three the clock\r\nand the camera took his photograph--in the twinkling of an eye. At\r\ntwenty minutes past three a second record was made. Before half-past\r\nthree the man was gone, and the camera winked every ten minutes until\r\nsix o'clock quite in vain. I came down early this morning and got the\r\nroll of negatives. One after another I developed them, disappointed\r\nthat I had almost counted fifty of them without reward. But the\r\nforty-third and the forty-fourth paid for all my trouble.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Whittier gave his son a look of pride. \"That was very ingeniously\r\nworked out, Paul; very ingeniously indeed,\" he said. \"If it had not\r\nbeen for your clock here I might have found it difficult to prove that\r\nthe Major was innocent--especially since he declared himself guilty.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wheatcroft rose to his feet, to close the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad we know the truth, anyhow,\" he asserted, emphatically. And\r\nthen, as though to relieve the strain on the old book-keeper, he added,\r\nwith a loud laugh at his own joke, \"That clock had its hands before its\r\nface all the time--but it kept its eyes open for all that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't forget that it had only one eye,\" said Whittier, joining in the\r\nlaugh; \"it had an eye single to its duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know the French saying, father,\" added Paul, \"'In the realm of the\r\nblind the one-eyed man is king.'\"\r\n\r\n(1895.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CONFIDENTIAL POSTSCRIPT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was pithily said by one of old that a bore is a man who insists upon\r\ntalking about himself when you want to talk about yourself. There is\r\nsome truth in the saying, no doubt; but surely it should not apply to\r\nthe relation of an author to his readers. So long, at least, as they\r\nare holding his book in their hands, it is a fair inference that they\r\ndo not wish to talk about themselves just that moment; indeed, it is\r\nnot a violent hypothesis to suggest that perhaps they are then willing\r\nenough to have him talk about himself. For the egotistic garrulity of\r\nthe author there is, in fact, no more fit occasion than in the final\r\npages of his book. At that stage of the game he may fairly enough count\r\non the good humor of his readers, since those who might be dissatisfied\r\nwith him would all have yielded to discouragement long before the\r\npostscript was reached.\r\n\r\nThe customary preface is not so pleasant a place for a confidential\r\nchat as the unconventional postscript. The real value and the true\r\npurpose of the preface is to serve as a telephone for the writer of the\r\nbook and to bear his message to the professional book-reviewers. On the\r\nother hand, only truly devoted readers will track the author to his\r\nlair in a distant postscript. While it might be presumptuous for him to\r\ntalk about himself before the unknown and anonymous book-reviewers, he\r\ncannot but be rejoiced at the chance of a gossip with his old friends,\r\nthe gentle readers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the present author cannot drop into conversation more easily\r\nthan by here venturing upon the expression of a purely personal\r\nfeeling--his own enjoyment in the weaving of the unsubstantial webs of\r\nimprobable adventure that fill the preceding pages. With an ironic\r\nsatisfaction was it that a writer who is not unaccustomed to be called\r\na mere realist here attempted fantasy, even though the results of his\r\neffort may reveal invention only and not imagination. It may even be\r\nthat it was memory (mother of the muses) rather than invention\r\n(daughter of necessity) which inspired the 'Primer of Imaginary\r\nGeography.' I have an uneasy wonder whether I should ever have gone on\r\nthis voyage of discovery with Mynheer Vanderdecken, past the Bohemia\r\nwhich is a desert country by the sea, if I had not in my youth been\r\nallowed to visit 'A Virtuoso's Collection'; and yet, to the best of my\r\nrecollection, it was no recalling of Hawthorne's tale, but a casual\r\nglance at the Carte du Pays de Tendre in a volume of Moliere, which\r\nfirst set me upon collecting the material for an imaginary geography.\r\n\r\nIn the second of these little fantasies the midnight wanderer saw\r\ncertain combats famous in all literature and certain dances. Where it\r\nwas possible use was made of the actual words of the great authors who\r\nhad described these combats and these dances, the descriptions being\r\ncondensed sometimes and sometimes their rhythm being a little modified\r\nso that they should not be out of keeping with the more pedestrian\r\nprose by which they were accompanied. Thus, as it happens, the dances\r\nof little Pearl and of Topsy could be set forth, fortunately, almost in\r\nthe very phrases of Hawthorne and of Mrs. Stowe, while I was forced to\r\ndescribe as best I could myself the gyrations of the wife who lived in\r\n'A Doll's House' and of her remote predecessor as a \"new woman,\" the\r\ndaughter of Herodias. The same method was followed in the writing of\r\nthe third of these tales, although the authors then drawn upon were\r\nmost of them less well known; and the only quotation of any length was\r\nthe one from Irving describing the mysterious deeds of the headless\r\nhorseman.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that the 'Dream-Gown of the Japanese Ambassador,'\r\ninstead of appearing complete in one number of a magazine, as the two\r\nearlier tales had done, was published in various daily newspapers in\r\nthree instalments. In the first of these divisions the returned\r\ntraveller fell asleep and saw himself in the crystal ball; in the\r\nsecond he went through the rest of his borrowed adventures; and in the\r\nthird his friend awakened him and unravelled the mystery. When the\r\nsecond part appeared a clergyman who had read the 'Sketch-Book' (even\r\nthough he had never heard of the 'Forty Seven Ronins,' or the\r\n'Shah-Nameh,' or the 'Custom of the Country') took his pen and sat down\r\nand wrote swiftly to a newspaper, declaring that this instalment of my\r\ntale had been \"cribbed bodily, and almost _verbatim et literatim_,\r\nin one-third of its entire length, from the familiar 'Legend of Sleepy\r\nHollow.'\" He asked sarcastically if the copyright notice printed at the\r\nhead of my story was meant to apply also to the passages plagiarized\r\nfrom Irving. He declared also that \"it is unfortunate for literary\r\npersons of the stamp of the author of 'Vignettes of Manhattan' that\r\nthere still exist readers who do not forget what they have read that is\r\nworth remembering. Such readers are not to be imposed on by the most\r\nskilful bunglers (_sic_) who endeavor to pass off as their own the\r\nwork of greater men.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer of this letter had given his address, Christ Church Rectory,\r\n----, N.J. (I suppress the name of the village for the sake of his\r\nparishioners as I suppress the name of the man for the sake of his\r\nfamily). Therefore I wrote to him at once, telling him that if he had\r\nread the third and final instalment of my story with the same attention\r\nhe had given to the second part he would understand why I was expecting\r\nto receive from him an apology for the letter he had sent to the\r\nnewspaper. In time there reached me this inadequate and disingenuous\r\nresponse, hardly worthy to be called even an apology for an apology:\r\n\r\n    \"In reply to your courteous communication, let me say that had I\r\n    seen the close of your short story, I should have grasped the\r\n    situation more fully, and should doubtless have refrained from\r\n    giving it any special attention.\r\n\r\n    \"When one considers, however, the manner in which your copy was\r\n    published by the paper, deferring the explanation until the\r\n    appearance of the third instalment, it must be acknowledged that\r\n    there was opportunity for surprise and criticism. The fault should\r\n    have been found with the way in which the article was published,\r\n    rather than with the story itself, that appearing at its conclusion\r\n    a self-confessed mosaic of quotations. Needless to add that its\r\n    author's aim to amuse, entertain, and instruct has been manifestly\r\n    subserved.\r\n\r\n    \"Yours most sincerely,\r\n\r\n    \"---- ----\"\r\n\r\nOf another tale ('Sixteen Years without a Birthday') I have nothing to\r\nsay--except to record a friend's remark after he had finished it, that\r\nhe had \"read something very like it not long before in a newspaper;\" so\r\nperhaps I may be permitted to declare that I had not read something\r\nvery like it anywhere, but had, to the best of my belief, \"made it all\r\nup out of my own head.\" Nor need I say anything about the 'Rival\r\nGhosts'--except to note that it is here reprinted from an earlier\r\ncollection of stories which has now for years been out of print.\r\n\r\nThe last tale of all, the 'Twinkling of an Eye,' received the second\r\nprize for the best detective story, offered by a newspaper\r\nsyndicate--the first prize being taken by a story written by Miss Mary\r\nE. Wilkins and Mr. J. E. Chamberlain. The use of the camera as a\r\ndetective agency had been suggested to me by a brief newspaper\r\nparagraph glanced at casually several years before. And I confess that\r\nit was with not a little amusement that I employed this device, since I\r\nhad then recently seen my 'Vignettes of Manhattan' criticized as being\r\n\"photographic in method.\" Here again I had no reason to doubt the\r\noriginality of my plot; and here once more was my confidence shattered,\r\nand I was forced to confess that fiction can never hope to keep ahead\r\nof fact.\r\n\r\nAfter the 'Twinkling of an Eye' was published in the newspapers which\r\nhad joined in offering the prizes, it was printed again in one of the\r\nsmaller magazines. There it was read by a gentleman connected with a\r\nhardware house in Grand Rapids, who wrote to me, informing me that the\r\nstory I had laboriously pieced together had--in some of its details, at\r\nleast--been anticipated by real life more than a year before I sat down\r\nto write out my narrative. This gentleman has now kindly given me\r\npermission to quote from his letter those passages which may be of\r\ninterest to readers of the 'Twinkling of an Eye':\r\n\r\nIt appears that the cash-drawer of the hardware store, in which small\r\nchange was habitually left over night for use in the morning before the\r\nbanks open, was robbed three nights running, although only a few\r\ndollars were taken at a time. \"The large vault, in which are kept the\r\nfirm's papers, had not been tampered with, and the work was evidently\r\nthat of some petty thief. The night-watchman was a trusted employee,\r\nand my father did not wish to accuse him unjustly. And, besides, he did\r\nnot wish to warn the thief. So nothing was said to the watchman. The\r\nnights on which the till had been tapped were Thursday, Friday, and\r\nSaturday. Father goes down to the store every Sunday morning for about\r\nhalf an hour to open the mail, and it was then that he discovered the\r\nSaturday night theft. Directly after Sunday dinner, father went down to\r\nsee an electrical friend of his, who executed a plan which my father\r\nhad devised. The cash-drawer was situated in one corner of the office\r\n(quite a large one), in which both the wholesale and retail business is\r\ntransacted. He placed a large detective camera in the corner opposite\r\nthe till, and beside it, and a little behind, a quantity of flash-light\r\npowder in a receptacle. This powder was connected by electric wires\r\nwith the till in such a manner, that when the drawer was opened the\r\ncircuit would be completed and the powder ignited. Everything worked to\r\nperfection. The office is always left dark at night, so the shutter of\r\nthe camera could be left open without spoiling the film. The camera was\r\nin place Sunday evening, but the thief stayed away. It was set again on\r\nMonday night, and that time we got him. A small wire was attached to a\r\nweight near the camera extending to the till. As the thief started to\r\nopen the drawer the weight made a slight noise. He glanced in the\r\ndirection of the noise, started, pulled the weight a little farther,\r\nand we had his picture. Detectives had already been working on the\r\ncase, and the thief was identified and arrested on the strength of the\r\nportrait. When he was informed that we had his picture, he made a full\r\nconfession. He said that when the flash-light went off he nearly\r\nfainted from fright.\"\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAfter this experience I am tempted to give up all hope that I can ever\r\ninvent anything which is not a fact, even before I make it up. I am now\r\nprepared, therefore, to discover that I did really have an interview\r\nwith Count Cagliostro, and also that I was actually an unwilling\r\nwitness at the wedding of the rival ghosts.\r\n\r\n(1896.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Tales of Fantasy and Fact, by Brander Matthews",
