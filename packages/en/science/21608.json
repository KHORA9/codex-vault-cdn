He also believes that metaphysics\r\nhas no place in a discussion of psychology, and has carefully refrained\r\nfrom using this once powerful weapon of psychologists.\r\n\r\nMany of the data used by the authors of more pretentious works are\r\nsecond-hand or hearsay; the author of this treatise, however, has no\r\nconfidence in the accuracy of such material, therefore he has not made\r\nuse of any such data. His material has been thoroughly sifted, and the\r\nreader may depend upon the absolute truth of the evidence here\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nThe author does not claim infallibility; some of his conclusions may be\r\nerroneous; he _believes_, however, that future investigation will\r\nprove the verity of every proposition that is advanced in this book. These\r\npropositions have been formulated only after a twenty-years study of\r\nbiology in all of its phases.\r\n\r\nSome of the data used in this volume have appeared in _Appleton's

a resultant of nerve, in the beginning of life, neuro-plasmic,\r\naction, through which and by which animal life in all its phases is\r\nconsciously and unconsciously, directly and indirectly, maintained,\r\nsustained, governed, and directed.\r\n\r\nThis definition of mind is widely different from the definition of those\r\nmetaphysical scientists who directed psychological investigation and\r\nobservation a decade ago. They held that psychology had nothing in\r\ncommon with physiology and morphology; that _psychos_ stood upon an\r\nindependent pedestal, and was not affected by, and did not affect, any\r\nof the phenomena of life.\r\n\r\nIn these days it is becoming an accepted fact that morphology,\r\nphysiology, and psychology are intimately related and connected, and\r\nthat a thorough knowledge of the one implies an equally thorough\r\nknowledge of the others.\r\n\r\nMorphology and physiology, until a comparatively recent time, led\r\ndivergent paths; but, thanks to such men as Haeckel, Romanes, Huxley,\r\nWolff, and many others, this erroneous method of investigation, to a\r\ngreat extent, has ceased.\r\n\r\n\"The two chief divisions of biological research--Morphology and\r\nPhysiology--have long travelled apart, taking different paths. This is\r\nperfectly natural, for the aims, as well as the methods, of the two\r\ndivisions are different. Morphology, the science of forms, aims at a\r\nscientific understanding of organic structures, of their internal and\r\nexternal proportions of form. Physiology, the science of functions, on\r\nthe other hand, aims at a knowledge of the functions of the organs, or,\r\nin other words, of the manifestations of life.\"[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] Haeckel, _Evolution of Man_, Vol. I. p. 20.\r\n\r\nIndeed, physiology has so diverged from its sister science, morphology,\r\nthat it completely and entirely ignores two of the most important\r\nfunctions of evolution, heredity and adaptation. This has been clearly\r\nshown by Haeckel, who has done much towards bringing about a change of\r\nopinion in these matters.[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] _Ibid._, p. 21 _et seq._\r\n\r\nMorphology and physiology are interdependent, correlated, and connected\r\none with the other; and, as I will endeavor to point out as my argument\r\ndevelops itself, psychology is, likewise, intimately associated with\r\nthese two manifestations of life.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that as forms take on more complexity, and as organs\r\ndevelop new and more complex functions, _psychos_ becomes less simple\r\nin its manifestations, and more complex in its relations to the internal\r\nand external operations of life.\r\n\r\nKeeping in view the definition of mind as advanced in the opening\r\nparagraph of this chapter, it at once becomes evident that even the very\r\nlowest forms of life possess mind in some degree. It is true that in the\r\n_monera_, or one-celled organisms, the nerve-cell is not differentiated;\r\nconsequently, if I were to be held to a close and strict accountability,\r\nmy definition of mind would not embrace these organisms. Yet, some small\r\nlatitude must be allowed in all definitions of psychological phenomena,\r\nespecially in those phenomena occurring in organisms which typify the\r\nvery beginnings of life.\r\n\r\nI am confident that, notwithstanding the fact that the nerve-_cell_ is\r\nnot differentiated in these primal forms, nerve-elements are,\r\nnevertheless, present in them, and serve to direct and control life.\r\n\r\nMind makes itself evident in two ways--consciously and unconsciously.\r\nThe conscious manifestations of mind are volitional, while the\r\nunconscious, \"vegetative,\" reflex operations of mind are wholly\r\ninvoluntary.\r\n\r\nAlthough the unconscious mind plays fully as prominent a role in the\r\neconomy of life as does the conscious mind, this treatise will not\r\ndiscuss the former, except indirectly. Yet, an outline sketch as to what\r\nis meant by the _unconscious_ mind will be necessary, in order that the\r\nreader may more fully comprehend my meaning when discussing _conscious_\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nA brief investigation of the anatomy, physiology, and psychology of the\r\nmedusa, or jelly-fish, will serve to illustrate the operations of the\r\nunconscious mind as it is to be noticed in its reflex and \"vegetative\"\r\nphases. The higher and more evolved phases of the unconscious mind will\r\nnot be discussed in this work, except incidentally, perhaps, as they may\r\nappear, from time to time, as my propositions are advanced, and the\r\nscheme of mental development is elaborated.\r\n\r\nThe medusa (the specimen that I take for study is a very common\r\nfresh-water individual) has a well-developed nervous system. Its\r\ntransparent, translucent nectocalyx, or swimming-bell, has a central\r\nnervous system which is localized on the margin of the bell, and which\r\nforms the so-called \"nerve-ring\" of Romanes.[3] This nerve-ring is\r\nseparated into an upper and lower nerve-ring by the \"veil,\" an annular\r\nsheet of tissue which forms the floor of the swimming-bell, or\r\n\"umbrella,\" and through a central opening in which the manubrium, or\r\n\"handle,\" of the umbrella passes down and hangs below the margin of the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n  [3] Romanes, _Jelly-Fish_, _Star-Fish_, _and Sea-Urchins_, p. 16.\r\n\r\nThe nerve-ring is well supplied with epithelial and ganglionic\r\nnerve-cells; their function is wholly reflex and involuntary; they\r\npreside over the pulsing or swimming movements of the nectocalyx. This\r\npulsing is excited by stimulation, and is analogous, so far as movement\r\nis concerned, to the peristaltic action of the intestines. Situated on\r\nthe margin of the bell are a number of very minute, round bodies, the\r\nso-called \"eyes.\" These eyes are supplied with nerves, one of whose\r\nfunctions is volitional, as I will endeavor to show in my chapter on\r\nConscious Determination.\r\n\r\nThe manubrium, or handle, is also the centre of a nerve-system. Nerves\r\nproceed from it and are spread out on the inner surface of the bell.\r\nThese nerves preside over digestion, and are involuntary. Certain\r\nganglia in the manubrium appear to preside over volitional effort. I\r\nhave never been able, however, to locate their exact position, nor to\r\ndetermine their precise action. They will be discussed more fully in the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system of the nectocalyx is exceedingly sensitive,\r\nresponding with remarkable quickness to stimulation. When two or three\r\nminims of alcohol are dropped into a pint of water in which one of these\r\ncreatures is swimming, the pulsing of the nectocalyx is notably\r\nincreased in frequency and volume.\r\n\r\nRomanes determined that the centres governing pulsation were located in\r\nthe nerve-ring of the swimming-bell, and that each section of the\r\nnectocalyx had its individual nerve-centre.[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] _Jelly-Fish_, _Star-Fish_, _and Sea-Urchins_, p. 65 _et seq._\r\n\r\nThe pulsing of the nectocalyx occasions a flow of water into and out of\r\nthe bell. This current brings both food and air (oxygen) to the animal,\r\nwhich is enabled to take these necessary life-sustainers into its system\r\nthrough the agency of vegetative nerve-action, a phase of the\r\nunconscious mind.\r\n\r\nThe unconscious mind made its appearance in animal life many thousands\r\nof years before the conscious mind came into existence. The latter\r\npsychical manifestation had its origin in sensual perception, which, in\r\nturn, gave rise to mental recepts and concepts.\r\n\r\nIn order fully to understand the origin of mind, it will be necessary to\r\ninvestigate the senses as they are observed in the lower animals. The\r\nfirst manifestation of conscious mind, which is, as I believe, conscious\r\ndetermination, or, volitional effort, is directly traceable to stimuli\r\naffecting the senses. This primal operation of conscious mind, and the\r\nmanner in which it is developed from sensational perceptions, will now\r\nbe discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SENSES IN THE LOWER ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that the primal, fundamental sense,--the sense\r\nof touch,--from which all the other senses have been evolved or\r\ndeveloped, has been in existence almost as long as life.\r\n\r\nIt is quite probable that it is to be found in the very lowest animal\r\norganisms; and, if our own senses were acute enough, it is more than\r\nprobable that we would be able to demonstrate its presence, beyond\r\nperadventure, in such organisms.\r\n\r\nThe senses of taste and smell, according to Graber, Lubbock, Farre, and\r\nmany other investigators, seem to be almost as old as the sense of\r\ntouch. My own observations teach me that certain actinophryans,[5]\r\nminute, microscopic animalcules, can differentiate between the starch\r\nspores of algae and grains of sand, thus showing that they possess taste,\r\nor an analogous sense.\r\n\r\n  [5] Vide the writer, _N. Y. Medical Record_, August 15, 1896.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I was examining an actinophrys (_Actinophrys\r\nEichornii_), which was engaged in feeding. It would seize a rotifer\r\n(there were numerous _Brachioni_ in the water) with one of its\r\npseudopodia, which it would then retract, until the captured Brachionus\r\nwas safely within its abdominal cavity. On the slide there were several\r\ngrains of sand, but these the actinophrys passed by without notice.\r\n\r\nI thought, at first, that this creature's attention was directed to its\r\nprey by the movements of the latter, but further investigation showed me\r\nthat this was not the case.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully rinsing the slide, I placed some alga spores (some of\r\nwhich were ruptured, thus allowing the starch grains to escape) and some\r\nminute crystals of uric acid upon it. Whenever the actinophrys touched a\r\nstarch grain with a pseudopod, the latter was at once retracted,\r\ncarrying the starch grain with it into the abdominal cavity of the\r\nactinophryan; the uric acid crystals were always ignored.\r\n\r\nI conclude from this experiment, that the actinophrys, which is\r\nexceedingly low in the scale of animal life, recognizes food by taste,\r\nor by some sense analogous to taste.\r\n\r\nMany species of these little animals, however, are not as intelligent as\r\nthe Eichorn actinophrys; they very frequently take in inert and useless\r\nsubstances, which, after a time, they get rid of by a process the\r\nreverse of that which they use in \"swallowing.\" By the latter process\r\nthey put _themselves_ on the outside of an object--in fact, they\r\nsurround it; by the former, they put the _object_ outside by allowing\r\nit to escape through their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe sense of sight makes its appearance in animals quite low in the\r\nscale, therefore the reader will pardon me if, while discussing this\r\nsense, I prove to be a bit discursive. The subject is, withal, so very\r\ninteresting that it calls for a close and minute investigation.\r\n\r\nOne of the immutable laws of nature declares that animals which are\r\nplaced in new surroundings, not fatal to life, undergo certain changes\r\nand modifications in their anatomical and physiological structures to\r\nmeet the exigencies demanded by such a modification of surroundings.\r\nThus, the flounder and his congeners, the turbot, the plaice, the sole,\r\netc., were, centuries and centuries ago, two-sided fishes, swimming\r\nupright, after the manner of the perch, the bass, and the salmon, with\r\neyes arranged one on each side of the head. From upright fishes,\r\nswimming, probably, close to the surface of the sea, they became\r\ndwellers on its bottom, and, in order to hide themselves more\r\neffectually from their enemies or their prey, they acquired the habit of\r\nswimming with one side next to the ground, and of partially or wholly\r\nburying themselves in the mud, always, however, with one side down. They\r\nthus became flat fishes, losing the coloring of their under surfaces,\r\nand their eyes migrating across their foreheads and taking up positions\r\non the upper surfaces of their heads. Again, when animals are placed\r\namong surroundings in which there is no need for some special organ,\r\nthis organ degenerates, and passes wholly or partially into a\r\nrudimentary condition, or, entirely out of existence. These latter\r\neffects of changed conditions on animals are especially noticeable in\r\nthe effect of continual darkness on the organs of sight of those\r\ncreatures which, owing to said mutations, have been compelled to dwell\r\nin darkness for untold ages.\r\n\r\nThe mole, far back in the past, had eyes, and gained its livelihood\r\nabove ground in the broad light of day; but, owing to some change in its\r\nsurroundings, it was forced to burrow beneath the surface of the earth;\r\nconsequently its organs of sight have degenerated, and are now\r\npractically worthless as far as _vision_ is concerned. All moles,\r\nhowever, can tell darkness from light, consequently, are not wholly\r\nblind--a certain amount of _sight_ remains. This is due to the fact\r\nthat, although the optic nerve, on examination, is invariably found to\r\nbe atrophied or wasted, there yet remain in the shrivelled nerve-cord\r\ntrue nerve-cells; these nerve-cells transmit light impressions to the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nEven if the optic nerves, and, in fact, all of the structures of the\r\neye, were absent, I yet believe that the mole could differentiate\r\nbetween daylight and darkness. The sensitive tufts and filaments of\r\nnerve in the skin, undoubtedly, in many instances, respond to the\r\nstimulation of light, so that totally blind animals, animals with no\r\nrudimentary organs of vision whatever, and the inception of whose\r\nancestors, themselves wholly blind, probably took place thousands of\r\nyears ago, show by their actions that light is exceedingly unpleasant to\r\nthem. Thus, I have seen actinophryans taken from the River Styx in\r\nMammoth Cave (which is their natural habitat), seeking to hide\r\nthemselves beneath a grain of sand which happened to be drawn up in the\r\npipette and dropped upon the glass slide beneath the object-glass of my\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly seen the blind fish of Mammoth Cave seeking out the\r\ndarkest spots in aquaria. In point of fact, I think it can be\r\ndemonstrated that light is directly fatal to these fishes; they soon die\r\nwhen taken from the river and placed in aquaria where there is an\r\nabundance of light.\r\n\r\nThese fish, although they have rudimentary eyes, never have the\r\nslightest remaining trace of nerve-cells in the wasted optic nerve (that\r\nis, I have never been able to discover any), thus showing that their\r\nappreciation of light is not derived through the agency of their eyes.\r\nAn eyeless spider (_Anthrobia_) taken from the same cavern showed a like\r\ndistaste for light, and yet, in this insect, there is absolutely no\r\nvestige of an eye or its nerves.\r\n\r\nFinally, a friend of mine, a youth of eighteen, totally blind since\r\nbirth, can differentiate between daylight and darkness. On one occasion\r\nI carefully blindfolded him and led him into the well-lighted office of\r\na brewery (he had never been in a brewery before), and asked him if it\r\nwere light or dark. He answered that it was almost as light as day. I\r\nthen conducted him into the dark beer vaults, and as soon as he passed\r\nthe door he exclaimed, \"How cold and dark it is here!\" Thinking that he\r\nmight possibly associate darkness with coldness, I asked him if this\r\nwere the case. \"No,\" he replied, \"I _see_ the darkness and I _feel_ the\r\ncold; they are not the same.\"\r\n\r\nIn these animals--and I include man--continuous darkness has modified\r\nsensibility (sense of touch) to such an extent that it has partially\r\ntaken on the functions of the useless organs--the eyes; these creatures\r\n_see_ with their skins.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that there is a creature in existence to-day, whether\r\nit has eyes or not, which cannot tell the difference between night and\r\nday. Professor Semper says that in the Pelew Islands he found a small\r\nfresh-water creature, whose generic name is _Cymothoe_, in pools where\r\ndaylight penetrated, that was absolutely blind.[6] We have fresh-water\r\nCymothoe living in our own waters that are close kin to the Pelew\r\nislander mentioned by Semper, and which are not blind. Along the middle\r\nof their backs, over the edge of each segment, there is an oblong dark\r\nspot. This little collection of coloring-matter is covered by a\r\ntransparent membrane, the cornea, and has a special nerve leading to the\r\nbrain, if I may use the word. These spots are primitive eyes, the\r\nanalogues of which are preserved by many of the true worms. I am\r\ninclined to believe that Semper would find primitive eyes of some form\r\nor other in the Cymothoe he mentions, if he were again to examine it.\r\nThe insects, etc., which dwell in caves, and which have eyes, are new\r\narrivals; they have not dwelt long enough in total darkness to have\r\nexperienced the full effects of changed surroundings. They show,\r\nhowever, that they are beginning to feel such effects, for there is more\r\nor less diminution in the color-cells of the eyes and body coverings. My\r\nexperiments on fish and frogs show, conclusively, that the\r\ncolor-producing function is directly due to light stimulation. The\r\nlonger fish and frogs are kept in total darkness, the lower is the\r\nnumber of color-cells and the smaller is the amount of coloring-matter.\r\nThis accounts for the fact that all animals which have dwelt in darkness\r\nfor untold ages are absolutely colorless. Pigmented or colored fishes,\r\nnevertheless, having well-developed organs of vision, have been taken\r\nfrom such depths (over a mile) as to preclude the possibility of a\r\nsingle ray of daylight.[7] These fishes, however, are phosphorescent,\r\nand thus furnish their own light. Moreover, I am inclined to believe\r\nthat the vast depths of the ocean, in certain localities, lie bathed in\r\na continuous phosphorescent glow, so that creatures living there neither\r\nlose their color nor their eyes, sufficient light being present to\r\nprevent degeneration. Where eyeless and colorless fishes are brought up\r\nfrom great depths, there the ocean is not phosphorescent, but is in\r\nabsolute darkness.\r\n\r\n  [6] Semper, _Animal Life_, p. 83.\r\n\r\n  [7] Hickson, _The Fauna of the Deep Sea_, p. 150 _et seq._\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations indicate that the sense of sight is a very\r\nold sense, and that it is to be found in a primitive form (ocelli) in\r\nanimals of exceedingly low organization. That this is true, I will now\r\nattempt to demonstrate.\r\n\r\nSight is the result of the conversion of one form of motion into\r\nanother--a conservation, as it were, of energy. Thus, waves of light\r\ncoming from a luminous body are arrested by the pigment-cells of the\r\nretina in our eyes and are transmuted into another form of motion, which\r\nis called nerve energy (in this instance, sight). It would seem that as\r\nfar as sight (_vision_ is not included) is concerned, eyes of very\r\nsimple construction would amply satisfy the needs of thousands of\r\ncreatures whose existence does not depend upon vision. This supposition\r\nis undoubtedly correct; there are many creatures in existence to-day\r\nwith eyes so exceedingly simple that they can form no visual picture of\r\nobjects--they are only able to discriminate between light and darkness.\r\nPrimitive eyes appear in animals very low in the scale of life; probably\r\nthe most remarkable of these early organs of sight are to be found in\r\nthe medusa, or jelly-fish. This creature, with its bell-shaped body and\r\npendent stem, bears a striking resemblance to an umbrella; noting this\r\nresemblance, naturalists have given the name _manubrium_, \"handle,\" to\r\nthe stem. Around the edge of the umbrella, and situated at regular\r\nintervals, are certain round, cell-like organs, which vary considerably\r\nin number. Some species have only eight, while others have sixty,\r\neighty, and even (in OEquorea) as high as six hundred.[8] These\r\nso-called \"marginal bodies\" are the eyes of the jelly-fish. By many\r\nbiologists these organs are considered to be ears; they contain within\r\ntheir capsules transparent bodies, which some scientists deem otoliths,\r\nor \"hearing-stones.\" Experimentation and microscopical examinations,\r\nhowever, have taught me very recently to believe otherwise. In these\r\nmarginal bodies there is always a deposit of pigment; this is,\r\nunquestionably, a primitive retina, while the transparent disk is,\r\nindubitably, a primitive lens. That these creatures can tell the\r\ndifference between light and darkness is a fact easily demonstrated.\r\nTime and again have I made them follow a bright light around the wall of\r\nthe aquarium in which they were confined. On one occasion I made some\r\nmedusae tipsy, and their drunken gravity as they rolled and staggered\r\nthrough the water in pursuit of the light was as sorrowful as it was\r\ninstructive; their actions in this respect were those of intoxicated\r\nmen. After I had siphoned off the alcoholized water and replaced it with\r\npure, they rapidly regained their normal status; whether or not any of\r\nthem felt any evil effects from their involuntary debauch, I am not\r\nprepared to state.\r\n\r\n  [8] Lubbock, _Senses, Instincts, and Intelligence of Animals_, p. 84.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of sea-urchins are rather highly developed, having corneae,\r\nretinae, and lenses. The lens generally lies in a mass of pigment, and,\r\nas Lubbock remarks, looks like a brilliant egg in a scarlet nest.[9] The\r\neyes are scattered over the dorsal surface of the creature's body, and\r\nare commonly situated just beneath the skin; they are, however,\r\nsometimes elevated on pear-shaped bulbs. The eyes of starfish are\r\ngenerally quite primitive in character, as far as I have been able to\r\ndetermine, being simply pigmented spots which are supplied with nerves;\r\nin several species, however, I have been able to make out lenses. The\r\neyes are arranged along the rays or arms, and vary in number.\r\n\r\n  [9] \"In Solaster or Asteracanthion the lenses look like brilliant\r\n  eggs, each in its own scarlet nest.\"--LUBBOCK, _Senses, Instincts, and\r\n  Intelligence of Animals_, p. 132 _et seq._\r\n\r\nEven the stay-at-home and humble oyster has eyes (not the round, fleshy\r\nmuscle called the \"eye\" by gourmands and epicures, but bright spots\r\naround the edge of the mantle)--primitive eyes, it is true, yet amply\r\nsufficient for the needs of a domestic, non-travelling, home body like\r\nthe oyster.\r\n\r\nIn most of the worms the eyes are simple ocelli--spots of pigment\r\nsupplied with nerves. These eyes can discriminate between light and\r\ndarkness, which is all that is required of them; but in the Alciope, a\r\nsmall sea-worm, these organs are brought to a high degree of perfection.\r\nThis worm is exceedingly transparent, so that when observing it, it is\r\ndifficult to make out more than its large orange eyes and the violet\r\nsegmental organs of each ring. It looks like an animated string of\r\nviolet disks surmounted by a pair of orange-colored eyeglasses. The eye\r\nof this creature is strikingly like that of a human being; it has a\r\ncornea, an \"eye-skin,\" a lens, vitreous humor (posterior chamber), and\r\nretina.\r\n\r\nAnother aquatic worm, Myrianida, is still more remarkable, not only on\r\naccount of its eyes, but also on account of the wonderful way in which\r\nit reproduces its young. When seen swimming in the water it presents the\r\nappearance of a long, many-ringed worm, which impels itself through and\r\nby the aid of its hundreds of flat, oar-like legs. Closer inspection\r\nreveals the startling fact that this seemingly single worm is really a\r\nmultiple worm--six or more individuals being joined together, thus\r\nforming a living chain. This creature reproduces itself by\r\nfissigemation; that is, when the young worms arrive at a certain age\r\nthey separate from the parent worm and begin life as individuals. These\r\nin turn eventually become multiple worms and divide into individuals,\r\nand so on _ad infinitum_. The tail worm, or that section farthest from\r\nthe head, is the oldest and is always the first to leave its comrades\r\nand take up a separate existence. The adverb _always_ in the above\r\nsentence is, strictly speaking, not exactly accurate, for on one\r\noccasion I saw the separation occur at the second head from the tail,\r\nthus producing twins. The two sections came apart, however, in a very\r\nfew seconds after their departure from the colony. I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that this deviation from the normal was due to accident;\r\nprobably to manipulation. This annelid is really \"many in one\" until the\r\nvery moment of division; the alimentary canal, nerves, blood-vessels,\r\netc., extend in unbroken continuity from the head of the parent worm to\r\nthe tail of the last section. In every fourth (sometimes fifth) ring two\r\nround, dark-colored spots will be observed; these spots are ocelli, and\r\nsome of them eventually become the eyes of young worms. These organs\r\neven in their embryonic state possess sight, for they have special\r\nnerves and pigment-cells; they can differentiate between light and\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe snail carries its eyes in telescopic watch-towers. This animal is,\r\nfor the most part, nocturnal in its habits, and, since prominent and\r\ncommanding view points are assigned to its organs of sight, one would\r\nnaturally expect to find a comparatively high degree of development in\r\nthem; and this supposition is correct. The eyes of the creature are in\r\nthe extreme tips of its \"horns,\" and consist of (1) a cornea, (2) a\r\nlens, and (3) a retina. Lubbock is rather disposed to decry the visual\r\npowers of the snail;[10] my conclusions, drawn from personal\r\nobservations, are, however, directly the opposite. The position of the\r\neyes at the extreme tips of the horns naturally indicates that they\r\nsubserve a very useful purpose; otherwise they would not have attained\r\nsuch prominence and such a high degree of development. Actual\r\nexperimentation declares that the garden snail can see a moving white\r\nobject, such as a ball of cotton or twine, at a distance of two feet. In\r\nmy experiments I used a pole ten feet in length, from the tip of which a\r\nwhite or dark ball was suspended by a string. The ball was made to\r\ndescribe a pendulum-like movement to and fro in front of the snail on a\r\nlevel with the tips of its horns. Time and again I have seen a snail\r\ndraw in its horns when it perceived the white ball, to it an unknown and\r\nterror-inspiring object. I have likewise seen it change its line of\r\nmarch, and proceed in another direction, in order to avoid the\r\nmysterious white stranger dancing athwart its pathway. Dark-colored\r\nobjects are not so readily perceived; at least, snails do not give any\r\nevidence of having seen them until they are brought within a foot of the\r\ncreatures under observation. A snail will generally see a black ball at\r\ntwelve or fourteen inches; sometimes it will not perceive the ball,\r\nhowever, until it has been brought to within six or eight inches of its\r\neyestalks. During the season of courtship snails easily perceive one\r\nanother at the distance of eighteen or twenty inches. I have often\r\nwatched them at such times, and have been highly entertained by their\r\nactions. The emotional natures of snails, as far as love and affection\r\nare concerned, seem to be highly developed, and they show plainly by\r\ntheir actions, when courting, the tenderness they feel for each other.\r\nThis has been noticed by many observers of high authority, notably\r\nDarwin, Romanes, and Wolff.[11] Mantagazza, a distinguished Italian\r\nscientist, in his _Physiognomy and Expression_, writes as follows: \"As\r\nlong as I live I shall never see anything equal to the loving tenderness\r\nof two snails, who, having in turn launched their little stone darts (as\r\nin prehistoric times), caress and embrace each other with a grace that\r\nmight arouse the envy of the most refined epicurean.\"[12]\r\n\r\n  [10] Lubbock, _loc. cit. ante_, p. 140.\r\n\r\n  [11] Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, p. 27.\r\n\r\n  [12] Mantagazza, _loc. cit._, p. 97.\r\n\r\nDarwin tells us that two snails, one of them an invalid, the other in\r\nperfect health, lived in the garden of one of his friends. Becoming\r\ndissatisfied with their surroundings, the healthy one went in search of\r\nanother home. When it had found it, it returned and assisted its sick\r\ncomrade to go thither, evincing toward it, throughout the entire\r\njourney, the utmost tenderness and solicitude.[13] The healthy snail\r\nmust have used its sight, as well as its other senses, to some purpose,\r\nfor, if my memory serves me correctly, we are told that the sick snail\r\nrapidly regained its health amid its new surroundings.\r\n\r\n  [13] Darwin, _Descent of Man_, pp. 262, 263.\r\n\r\nThe crayfish also has its eyes at the tips of eyestalks, but the eyes of\r\nthis creature are very different, indeed, from the eyes of the snail.\r\nThey are what are known as compound eyes, a type common to the crayfish\r\nand lobster families. Viewed from above, the cornea of a crayfish is\r\nseen to be divided into a number of compartments or cells, and looks, in\r\nthis respect, very much like a section of honeycomb. The microscope\r\nshows that in each one of these cell-like compartments there is a\r\ntransparent cone-shaped body; this is called the crystalline cone. The\r\napex of this cone is prolonged into an exceedingly small tube, that\r\nenters a striped spindle-like body called the striated spindle; the\r\nentire structure is called a visual rod. Nerve-fibrils emanating from\r\nthe optic nerve enter the striated spindle at its lower extremity, and\r\nin this way nervously energize the visual rod. There is a deposit of\r\npigment about the visual rod which arrests all rays of light save those\r\nwhich strike the cornea parallel to the long axis of the crystalline\r\ncone. We see from this that the visual picture formed by a crayfish's\r\neye must be made up of many parts; it is, in fact, a mosaic of hundreds\r\nof little pictured sections, which, when united, form the picture as a\r\nwhole. Each visual rod receives its impression from the ray or rays of\r\nlight reflected from the object viewed which strike it in the line of\r\nits long axis; the other rays are stopped by the layer of pigment-cells.\r\nWhen the impressions of all the visual rods are added together, the sum\r\nwill be a mosaic of the object, but such a perfect one that the junction\r\nof its many portions will be absolutely imperceptible.\r\n\r\nThe crayfish can see quite well. It has been thought that this creature\r\nuses its sense of smell more than its sense of sight in the procurement\r\nof its food. This is undoubtedly true where the animal is surrounded by\r\nwater that is muddy, or that is otherwise rendered opaque. The\r\nodoriferous particles coming from the food being carried to the creature\r\nby the water, it follows them until it arrives at this source.\r\n\r\nIt is different, however, in clear water and on land. I have seen\r\ncrayfish rush down stream after bits of meat thrown to them, thus showing\r\nthat here, at least, the sense of sight directed them. Again, I have\r\nenticed crayfish from clear streams by slowly dragging a baited hook in\r\nfront of them. Moreover, when high and dry on land, I have seen them\r\nfollow with their eyes and bodies the tempting morsel as it waved to and\r\nfro in the air above their heads.\r\n\r\nThe female crayfish carries her eggs beneath her tail, and, when they\r\nhave hatched out, the young find this sheltering member a safe and cosey\r\ndwelling-place until they have grown strong enough to enter life's\r\nstruggle. At such times, the mother crayfish is quite brave, and will do\r\nbattle with any foe. With her eyestalks protruded to their utmost extent,\r\nshe vigilantly watches her enemy. Her eyes follow his movements, and her\r\nsharp nipper is held in readiness for immediate use.\r\n\r\nActual experimentation has taught that these animals can descry a man at\r\nthe distance of twenty or twenty-five feet. When approaching a crayfish\r\n\"town\" for the purpose of making observations, I use the utmost caution;\r\notherwise, each inhabitant will retreat into its burrow before I can\r\ncome close enough to observe them, even with my field-glasses.\r\n\r\nThe gyrinus, or \"whirligig beetle,\" whose dwelling-place during the\r\ngreater portion of its life is, like that of the crayfish, in ponds and\r\nstreams, has remarkably acute vision. This insect is a true cosmopolite,\r\nhowever, and is as much at home on dry land as it is in the water. All\r\nseasons seem to be alike to it, just so the sun shines; for, during the\r\nhottest days of summer and the coldest days of winter (that is, if there\r\nis sunlight and no ice on the water), it may be seen on the surface of\r\nponds and streams, gyrating hither and thither in a seemingly mad and\r\npurposeless manner.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these creatures will be seen at one moment floating on the\r\nwater, still and motionless; the next moment they will be darting here\r\nand there over the surface of the water, their black and burnished backs\r\nshining in the sunlight like brilliant gems. Suddenly, it is \"heels up\r\nand heads down,\" and they disappear beneath the surface, each of them\r\ncarrying a bubble of air caught beneath the wing-tips; or, as the late\r\nWilliam Hamilton Gibson expresses it, \"they carry a brilliant lantern\r\nthat goes gleaming like a silver streak down into the depths, for a\r\nbubble of air is caught beneath their black wing-covers, and a diamond\r\nof pure sunlight accompanies their course down among the weeds until\r\nthey once more ascend to the surface.\"[14] This little beetle is well\r\nprovided with eyes, for it has a large pair beneath its head, with which\r\nit sees all that is going on in the water below, and another pair on the\r\nsides of its head, with which it keeps a bright lookout above. That it\r\nhas remarkably keen vision with the latter pair, any one who has tried\r\nto steal upon them unawares can testify.[15]\r\n\r\n  [14] William Hamilton Gibson, _Sharp Eyes_, p. 307.\r\n\r\n  [15] I have a distinct purpose in introducing these and other\r\n  queer-eyed individuals while discussing the sense of sight. I wish to\r\n  demonstrate through one or more of them the correlation of morphology,\r\n  physiology, and psychology, as formulated in the first chapter of this\r\n  work. This is one of the most important facts in the doctrine of\r\n  evolution, and upon it is based the law of progressive psychical\r\n  development from the simple manifestations of conscious determination\r\n  in the lowest organisms to the most complex operations of the mind in\r\n  man.\r\n\r\nThe queerest of all queer-eyed animals is, probably, the Periophthalmus,\r\na fish inhabiting the coasts of China, Japan, India, the Malayan\r\nArchipelago, and East Africa.[16]\r\n\r\n  [16] Semper, _Animal Life_, p. 374 _et seq._\r\n\r\nI use the word coasts advisedly, for this strange creature when in\r\npursuit of its prey leaves the sea and comes out on the sands, thus\r\nexisting, for the greater portion of its life, in an element which,\r\naccording to the general nature of things, ought to be fatal to it. The\r\nlaws of evolution have, however, eminently prepared it for its peculiar\r\nmode of life, for its gill-cavities have become so enlarged that when it\r\nabandons the sea it carries in them a great quantity of water which\r\nyields up the necessary supply of oxygen.\r\n\r\nIts locomotion has been provided for likewise, for continued use along\r\ncertain lines has so developed its pectoral fins that the creature uses\r\nthem as legs, and jumps along at a surprising rate of speed.\r\n\r\nIts eyes are very large and prominent, and possess, for a fish, the\r\npeculiar faculty of looking around on all sides, hence its name,\r\n\"periophthalmus,\" which is derived from the Greek words, [Greek: peri],\r\naround, and [Greek: ophthalmos], eye. These eyes are situated on top of\r\nthe animal's head, and present a very grotesque appearance.\r\n\r\nThe favorite food of this fish is Onchidium, a naked mollusk. And, in\r\nthe matter of eyes, this last-mentioned creature is itself worthy of\r\nremark. Its cephalic, or head, eyes are like those of other mollusks of\r\nits genus, and are not worthy of special mention, but its dorsal eyes,\r\nsometimes several dozen in number, are truly remarkable. These eyes,\r\nalthough they are very simple in structure, in type are the same as\r\nthose of vertebrates, having corneae, lenses, retinae, and \"blind spots.\"\r\n(In the vertebrate eye, the spot where the optic nerve pierces the\r\nexternal layer of the retina is not sensitive to light impressions;\r\nhence, it is called the \"blind spot.\")\r\n\r\nWhen this mollusk sees periophthalmus bounding over the sands (and that\r\nit does see is beyond all question), what does it do? It contracts a\r\nthousand or so of little bladder-like cells in the skin of its back,\r\nthereby discharging a hailstorm of minute concretions in the face of its\r\nenemy. The fish, terrified and amazed by the volley, often turns aside,\r\nand the mollusk is saved. Thus we see that its dorsal eyes are of great\r\nservice to onchidium.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were, unwittingly, very near an anatomical truth when they\r\nascribed to certain monsters, called cyclopes, only one eye apiece,\r\nwhich was placed in the centre of their foreheads. The cyclopean eye\r\nexists to-day in the brains of men in a rudimentary form, for in the\r\npineal gland we find the last vestiges of that which was once a third\r\neye, and which looked out into the world, if not from the centre of the\r\nforehead, at least from very near that point. There is alive to-day a\r\nlittle creature which would put to shame the one-eyed arrogance and\r\npride of Polyphemus, and Arges, and Brontes, and Steropes, and all the\r\nrest of the single-eyed gentry who, in the days of myths and\r\nmyth-makers, inhabited the \"fair Sicilian Isle.\" The animal in question\r\nis a small lizard, called Calotis. Its well-developed third eye is\r\nsituated in the top of its head, and can be easily seen through the\r\nmodified and transparent scale which serves it as a cornea. Many other\r\nlacertilians have this third eye, though it is not so highly organized\r\nas it is in the species just mentioned. A tree lizard, which is to be\r\nfound in the mountains of East Tennessee and Kentucky, has its third eye\r\nquite well developed. This little animal is called the \"singing\r\nscorpion\" by the mountaineers (by the way, all lizards are scorpions to\r\nthese people), and is a most interesting creature. I heard its plaintive\r\n\"peep, peep, peep,\" on Chilhowee Mountain a number of times before I\r\nbecame aware of the fact that a lizard was the singer. On dissection,\r\nthe third eye will be found lying immediately beneath the skin; it has a\r\nlens, retina, and optic nerve.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the sense of sight is to be found in animals very low\r\nin the scale of life. From a simple accumulation of pigment-cells which\r\nserves to arrest light rays (in simple organisms such as rotifers) to\r\nthat complex and beautiful structure--the human eye--the organs of\r\nvision have been developed, step by step.\r\n\r\nWe will also see in the course of this discussion that, just as these\r\nsimple and primal organisms have given place to more complex forms, just\r\nso have the operations of mind become higher and more involved. We see,\r\nin periopthalmus, a creature exceedingly well adapted by form, function,\r\nand intelligence to its manner of life. We must admit, in fact, the\r\ncorrelation and interdependence of morphology, physiology, and\r\npsychology in the evolution of this creature from its ancestral form to\r\nits present status.\r\n\r\nThe primitive organ of audition as it is to be observed in creatures of\r\nsimple, comparatively speaking, organization is as simple as is the\r\nanatomy of the animals in which it is found. Commonly, it is a hollow\r\nhair, which is connected by a minute nerve-filament with the sensorium.\r\nSound vibrations set the hair to vibrating, which in turn conveys the\r\nvibrations to the nerve-filament, and so on to the auditory centre.\r\nSometimes the hair is not hollow; in this case, the root of the hair is\r\nintimately associated with nerve-filaments which take up vibrations.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the majority of the lower animals, especially\r\nthose which are sound-producers, can hear just as we hear. It is also\r\nhighly probable that the so-called deaf animals can hear, just as we\r\nhear when we have either been born deaf, or through disease have lost\r\nthe power of hearing--by _feeling_ the sound waves.\r\n\r\nOwing to our own lack of acuteness, all of the problems involved in this\r\nquestion of audition in the lower animals will, probably, never be\r\ndefinitely settled; yet, reasoning by analogy, we can, approximately,\r\nsolve some of them.\r\n\r\nBy far the larger number of entomologists locate the auditory organs of\r\ninsects in their antennae. I have only to mention the names of such men\r\nas Kirby, Spence, Burmeister, Hicks, Wolff, Newport, Oken, Strauss,\r\nDurkheim, and Carus, who advance this opinion, to show what a formidable\r\narray of talent maintains it. Yet my observations lead me to believe\r\notherwise, though these authorities are in part correct. As far as\r\nLepidoptera are concerned, and certain of Hemiptera, they are right--the\r\nantennae in these creatures are the seat of the organs of audition. But\r\nin Orthoptera, in most of Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Diptera, and in\r\ncertain bugs (Hemiptera), they are located elsewhere. The habit that\r\nalmost all insects have of retracting their antennae when alarmed by\r\nnoise, or otherwise, has done much to advance and strengthen the opinion\r\nthat these appendages are the seat of insect ears; yet I am confident\r\nthat in nine cases out of ten the antennae are retracted through fear of\r\ninjury to them, and not through any impression made on them by sound.\r\nThe antennae are the most exposed and least protected of any of the\r\nappendages or members of the insect body; hence their retraction by\r\ninsects when alarmed is an instinctively protective action. They shelter\r\nthem as much as possible in order to keep them from being injured.\r\nAgain, although the antennae of most insects are provided with numerous\r\nsensitive hairs, or setae, we have no right to assume that these hairs\r\nare auditory; no \"auditory rods,\" otoliths, etc., are to be found\r\ngenerally in antennae, yet there are exceptional instances. Leydig found\r\nauditory rods in the antennae of _Dyticus marginalis_ (Furneaux[17]), the\r\ngiant water-beetle, and I myself have observed them in _Corydalis\r\ncornuta_ and other neuropterous insects. I am inclined to believe that\r\nthe entire order of Neuroptera has antennal ears, and should therefore\r\nin this respect be classed with Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n  [17] Consult Furneaux, _Life in Ponds and Streams_, p. 325.\r\n\r\nIn grasshoppers and crickets the ears are situated in the anterior pairs\r\nof legs. If the tibia of a grasshopper's anterior leg be examined, two\r\n(one before and one behind) shining, oval, membranous disks, surrounded\r\nby a marginal ridge, will be at once observed. These are the tympana or\r\near-drums of the ear of that leg. Where the trachea, or air-tube, enters\r\nthe tibia it becomes enlarged and divides into two channels; these two\r\nchannels unite again lower down in the shaft of the tibia. The tracheae\r\nof non-stridulating grylli are much smaller than those of\r\nsound-producing grasshoppers. The same may be said of the tibial\r\nair-tubes of the so-called dumb crickets. In grasshoppers and crickets\r\nthe ear-drums lie bathed in air on both sides--the open air on the\r\nexternal side and the air of the air-tube, or trachea, on the inside.\r\nLubbock calls attention to the fact that \"the trachea acts like the\r\nEustachian tube in our own ear; it maintains an equilibrium of pressure\r\non each side of the tympanum, and enables it freely to transmit\r\natmospheric vibrations.\"\r\n\r\nIn grasshoppers the auditory nerve, after entering the tibia, divides into\r\ntwo branches, one forming the supratympanal ganglion, the other descending\r\nto the tympanum and forming a ganglion known as Siebold's organ. This\r\nlast-mentioned ganglion is strikingly like the organ of Corti in our own\r\near, and undoubtedly serves a like purpose in the phenomenon of audition.\r\nThe organ of Corti is composed of some four thousand delicate vesicles,\r\ngraduated in size, each one of which vibrates in unison with some\r\nparticular number of sound vibrations. The organ of Siebold in the\r\ngrasshopper's ear begins with vesicles, of which a few of the first are\r\nnearly equal in size; these vesicles then regularly diminish in size to\r\nthe end of the series. Each of these vesicles contains an auditory rod,\r\nand is in communication with the auditory nerve through a delicate\r\nnerve-fibril. I have observed that each of these nerve-fibrils swells into\r\na minute ganglion immediately after leaving its particular vesicle; the\r\nfunction of these ganglia is, I take it, to strengthen and reenforce\r\nnerve-energy. No other observer mentions these ganglia, as far as I have\r\nbeen able to determine; they may have been absent, however, in the\r\nspecimens studied by others, yet in the specimens studied by myself--the\r\n\"red-legged locust\" (_Melanoplus femur-rubrum_, Comstock)[18] and the\r\n\"meadow grasshopper\" (_Xiphidium_), they were always present.\r\n\r\n  [18] Consult Comstock, _Manual for the Study of Insects_, p. 110.\r\n\r\nThat grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets can hear, no one who has\r\nobserved these creatures during the mating season will for one instant\r\ndeny; they hear readily and well, for in most of them the sense of\r\nhearing is remarkably acute.\r\n\r\nImmediately behind the wings of flies two curious knobbed organs are to\r\nbe observed; these are considered to be rudimentary hinder wings by\r\nentomologists, and are called the halteres. Bolles Lee and others of\r\nthe French scientists call them _balanciers_. This latter name I\r\nconsider the correct one, for these organs unquestionably preside over\r\nalate equilibrium: they are true balancers. I do not propose to enter\r\ninto any discussion as to whether these organs are rudimentary wings or\r\nnot; suffice it to say that they appear to me to be organs fully\r\ndeveloped and amply sufficient to serve the purposes for which they were\r\ncreated. Whether or not in the process of evolution there has occurred a\r\nchange of function, is a point which will not be discussed in this\r\npaper. As they now exist, I deem them to be auditory organs of Diptera\r\n(flies, gnats, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe semicircular canals are, to a great extent if not entirely, the seat\r\nof equilibration in man. Any derangement or disease of these canals\r\ninterferes with equilibration; this is well shown in Meniere's disease,\r\nin which there is always marked disturbance of the equilibrating\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\nIf the balancers of a horsefly be removed, the insect at once loses its\r\nequilibrium; it cannot direct its flight, but plunges headlong to the\r\nground. The same can be said of _Chrysops niger_--in fact, of the entire\r\nfamily of Tabanidae, of the gall gnat (_Diplosis resinicola_, Comstock),\r\nand of the March flies (_Bibionidae_). These widely differing flies\r\nconstitute the material from which I have derived my data; I will\r\nventure to assert, however, without fear of contradiction, that what\r\nhas been said about the flies mentioned above is equally true of all\r\nflies.\r\n\r\nWhen the knobbed end of the balancers of the horsefly (_Tabanus\r\natratus_, Comstock)[19] are examined with the microscope, the cuticle\r\nwill be found to be set with minute hairs or setae; some of these hairs\r\npenetrate both cuticle and hypoderm, are hollow, and receive into their\r\nhollows delicate nerve-fibrils. These nerve-fibrils pass inward toward\r\nthe centre, and enter ganglia, which in turn are in immediate connection\r\nwith the great nerves of the balancers. There is but one nerve in the\r\ninsect's body that is larger than the balancer nerve, and that is the\r\noptic nerve; hence, it is natural to infer that the balancer nerve leads\r\nto some special sense centre. This centre in my opinion is,\r\nunquestionably, the seat of the auditory function.\r\n\r\n  [19] Consult Comstock, _loc. cit. ante_, p. 455.\r\n\r\nIt has been demonstrated beyond doubt that analogous hollow hairs, or\r\nsetae, are prominent factors of audition in many animals, notably\r\ncrustaceans, such as the lobster, the crab, and the crayfish, and many\r\nof the insect family; hence, it is logically correct to conclude that\r\nthe hollow hairs on the balancers of flies are likewise auditory hairs.\r\nMoreover, there are grouped about the bases of these knobbed organs\r\ncertain rows of vesicles, which contain auditory rods almost identical\r\nin appearance with the auditory rods of the grasshopper. Indeed, I have\r\nfound those in the upper row of vesicles to be precisely similar in\r\nappearance to the rods found in Melanoplus.\r\n\r\nI have determined that in the horsefly (_Tabanus atratus_) there are six\r\nrows of these vesicles, and that they are graduated in size. There are\r\nin the knobs of the balancers minute spiracles (I do not think that\r\nthese have been pointed out before by any other observer) through which\r\nair passes into the large, vesicular cells which make up the greater\r\nportion of the knobs; spiracles are also to be found in the shafts of\r\nthe balancers, thus providing an abundance of air to the internal\r\nstructures of these organs and allowing for the free transmission of\r\nsound vibrations.\r\n\r\nI am well aware of the fact that in considering these organs to be the\r\nears of flies, I antagonize Lee and others who consider them olfactory\r\nin character.[20] The position I take in regard to these organs is,\r\nhowever, a tenable one, and one that cannot easily be overthrown.\r\n\r\n  [20] Bolles Lee, _Les Balanciers des Dipteres_; quoted also by\r\n  Lubbock, _Senses, Instincts_, etc., pp. 110, 111.\r\n\r\nThe ears of Lepidoptera (butterflies) are situated in their antennae. This\r\nfact has been clearly demonstrated by Lubbock, Graber, Leydig, and Wolff.\r\nNewport has made an especially exhaustive study of the antennae of insects;\r\nand he, too, places the organs of audition in these appendages.[21] But in\r\nColeoptera my experiments and microscopical researches compel me to\r\nassert that I differ somewhat from the conclusions of the above-mentioned\r\nauthorities. These gentlemen locate the ears of beetles also in their\r\nantennae. Lubbock bases his conclusions on an experiment of Will--an\r\nexperiment which, if it had been carried a little further, would have\r\ndemonstrated the fact that the ears of beetles are not in their antennae,\r\nbut are, on the contrary, in their maxillary palpi.\r\n\r\n  [21] Newport, _The Antennae of Insects_, Entomol. Society, Vol. II.\r\n\r\nWill put a female Cerambyx beetle into a box, which he placed on a\r\ntable; he then put a male Cerambyx on the table, some four inches from\r\nthe box. When he touched the female she began to chirrup, whereupon the\r\nmale turned his antennae toward the box, \"as if to determine from which\r\ndirection the sound came, and then marched straight toward the female.\"\r\nWill concluded from this that the ears of the beetle were located in its\r\nantennae.[22]\r\n\r\n  [22] Will, _Das Geschmacksorgen der Insecten_, Wiss. Zool.; quoted\r\n  also by Lubbock, _Senses, Instincts_, etc., p. 96.\r\n\r\nSeeing that Will's experiment as described by him was incomplete, I took\r\na pair of beetles belonging to the same family (genus _Prionus_), and\r\ndetermined the true location of their ears by a system of rigid\r\nexclusion. These beetles, when irritated, make a squeaking chirrup by\r\nrubbing together the prothorax and mesothorax.\r\n\r\nWhen I irritated the female she began to chirrup, and the male\r\nimmediately turned toward the small paper box in which she was confined.\r\nI then removed the antennae of the male, and again made the female\r\nstridulate; the male heard her, and at once crawled toward her, although\r\nhis antennae were entirely removed.\r\n\r\nThis showed conclusively that the organs of audition were not located in\r\nthe antennae, as Will supposed and as Lubbock advocates. I then removed\r\nthe maxillary palpi of the male, after which the insect remained deaf to\r\nall sounds emanating from the female.\r\n\r\nAgain, I took an unmutilated male, which at once turned and crawled\r\ntoward the chirruping female. I then removed its labial palpi, leaving\r\nmaxillary palpi and antennae intact; it heard the female and made toward\r\nher. The maxillary palpi were then removed (the antennae being left _in\r\nsitu_), and at once the creature became deaf.\r\n\r\nIf the maxillary palpi of long-horned beetles be examined, certain\r\nvesicular organs, each containing a microscopic hair, will be observed\r\nin the basal segments; these, I take it, are auditory vesicles. In some\r\nof the Coleoptera I have found auditory rods in the apical segments,\r\nthough this is by no means a common occurrence. In Cicindelidae and\r\nCarabidae these auditory vesicles are exceedingly small, and require a\r\nvery high-power objective in order to be clearly seen.\r\n\r\nIn justice to other observers I must say, however, that I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that in all beetles the antennae in some way aid or assist\r\naudition, but they are adjuncts, as it were, and not absolutely\r\nnecessary. It is a matter of easy demonstration to show that some of\r\nthese insects hear less acutely where they are deprived of their antennae.\r\nI presume they are about as necessary in audition as are the external\r\nappendages of the human ear; this, however, is mere supposition, and has\r\nno scientific warrant for its verity.\r\n\r\nI have purposely said but very little about the senses of touch, taste,\r\nand smell in this discussion of the senses in the lower animals. These\r\nthree senses have been so exhaustively treated by Lubbock in his\r\n_Senses, Instincts, and Intelligences of Animals_, that I could not hope\r\nto introduce any new data in regard to them. Graber, Frey, Leuckart,\r\nFarre, Hertwig, and a host of others have likewise investigated these\r\nsenses most thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAs to the senses of sight and hearing, the matter presented a different\r\naspect. I was confident that I could add somewhat to the knowledge\r\nalready formulated, consequently I have treated these senses at some\r\nlength. Technicalities and the details of microscopic investigation,\r\nespecially microscopic anatomy, have been omitted; they have no place in\r\na work like this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCONSCIOUS DETERMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\nConscious determination, or, effort induced by conscious volition, is\r\nthe basic mental operation upon which is reared that complex psychical\r\nstructure which is to be found in the higher animals, and especially in\r\nman--the highest product of evolutionary development.\r\n\r\nBy conscious volition is not meant that consciousness which appertains\r\nto the child of two or three years, who, at that age, recognizes the\r\n_ego_. Ego-knowledge, while undoubtedly present in some of the higher\r\nanimals, such as the dog, monkey, horse, cat, etc., is not a factor in\r\nthe psychical make-up of any of the lower animals (insects, crustaceans,\r\nmollusks, etc.). But consciousness, so far as volition or choice is\r\nconcerned, enters into the _psychos_ of animals exceedingly low in the\r\nscale of animal life.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the chapter on the senses in the lower animals, that\r\nanimals possess one or all of the five senses--touch, taste, smell,\r\nsight, and hearing; we will see in a later chapter that some of them\r\nlikewise possess certain other senses which man has lost in the process\r\nof evolution.\r\n\r\nNow, let us very briefly discuss the _modus operandi_ through which and\r\nby which conscious determination and other psychical manifestations\r\narise from the physical basis--the senses.[23] I have asserted, and, as\r\nI believe, I have demonstrated elsewhere, the interdependence and\r\ncorrelation of physiology and psychology. Furthermore, I wish to be\r\nplainly understood as also asserting the physical basis and origin of\r\nall psychical operations whatever they may be.\r\n\r\n  [23] \"Sensorial impression is at the bottom of all our ideas, all our\r\n  conceptions, though it may at first conceal itself in the form of a\r\n  binary, ternary, quaternary compound; and, on our methodically\r\n  pursuing the inquiry, it is easily recognizable--just as a simple\r\n  substance in organic chemistry may be always summoned to appear, if we\r\n  sit down with the resolution to disengage it from all the artificial\r\n  combinations which hold it imprisoned.\"--LUYS, _The Brain and its\r\n  Functions_, p. 252.\r\n\r\nMind is always associated, according to our experience and knowledge\r\n(and this question must be studied objectively) with a peculiar tissue\r\nwhich is only to be found in animal organisms. This tissue is called\r\nnerve, and is made up of cells and, broadly speaking, prolongations of\r\ncells which are called nerve-fibres.\r\n\r\nCertain accumulations of nerve-cells called ganglions (ganglia) are to\r\nbe found scattered throughout the structure of animals. Experiment and\r\nobservation teach that these ganglia subserve a governing influence\r\nover nerve-action; hence, they are called nerve-centres.\r\n\r\nNerve-tissue is found in all animals above and including Hydrozoa,\r\naccording to Romanes;[24] I am inclined to believe, however, that it is\r\npresent in animals even lower than Hydrozoa, for I have been able, on more\r\nthan one occasion, to verify Professor Clark's observations in regard to\r\nthe protozoan, _Stentor polymorphus_, which, as he asserts,[25] has a\r\nwell-developed nervous system. Moreover, I have seen, in my opinion,\r\nunquestionable acts of conscious determination enacted by this little\r\ncreature, as I will point out further along in this chapter.\r\n\r\n  [24] Romanes, _Mental Evolution in Animals_, p. 24.\r\n\r\n  [25] Clark, _Mind in Nature_, p. 64 _et seq._\r\n\r\nNerve-tissue has the peculiar faculty of transmitting impressions made\r\nupon it by stimuli. When a nerve is acted on by a stimulus, the\r\nimpression wave is transmitted along the in-going nerve to the ganglion;\r\nhere, the stimulus is transferred to the out-going nerve, which, going\r\nto the muscle, causes it to contract.\r\n\r\nThis form of nerve-action is called reflex action, and reflex action is,\r\nin the beginning, the germ from which spring volition (choice) and all\r\nof the higher psychical attributes.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is to be observed, as animals become more highly organized,\r\nthat nerves have the power of discriminating between stimuli, and \"it is\r\nthis power of discriminating between stimuli,\" as Romanes puts it,\r\n\"_irrespective of their relative mechanical intensities_, that\r\nconstitutes the physiological aspect of choice\" (volition). It is also\r\nthrough the faculty of discrimination that the special senses, upon\r\nwhich the entire psychical structure depends, have been evolved.\r\n\r\nThe fact of this power of discrimination has been so clearly and so\r\nbeautifully demonstrated by Romanes, that I present his experiment and\r\nobservations, as detailed by him in his magnificent work, _Mental\r\nEvolution in Animals_:--\r\n\r\n\"I have observed that if a sea-anemone is placed in an aquarium tank,\r\nand allowed to fasten on one side of the tank near the surface of the\r\nwater, and if a jet of sea-water is made to play continuously and\r\nforcibly upon the anemone from above, the result of course is that the\r\nanimal becomes surrounded with a turmoil of water and air-bubbles. Yet,\r\nafter a short time, it becomes so accustomed to this turmoil that it\r\nwill expand its tentacles in search of food, just as it does when placed\r\nin calm water. If now one of the expanded tentacles is gently touched\r\nwith a solid body, all the others close around that body, in just the\r\nsame way as they would were they expanded in calm water. That is to say,\r\nthe tentacles are able to discriminate between the stimulus which is\r\napplied by the turmoil of the water and that which is supplied by their\r\ncontact with the solid body, and they respond to the latter stimulus\r\nnotwithstanding that it is of incomparably less intensity than the\r\nformer.\"[26]\r\n\r\n  [26] Romanes, _Mental Evolution in Animals_, pp. 48, 49.\r\n\r\nWhen a stimulus passes over a nerve to a ganglion, it leaves upon it an\r\nimpression which remains for a shorter or longer time as the stimulus is\r\ngreat or small. Now, when a stimulus is again applied to the nerve, the\r\nimpression wave follows in the footsteps, as it were, of the first\r\nimpression wave, and the ganglion reflects or transfers it just as\r\nbefore, thus showing that nerve has another peculiar quality--that of\r\n_memory_.\r\n\r\nAgain, when two or more reflexes are excited by the same stimulus or\r\nstimuli, the ganglion learns to associate one with the other, thus\r\nshowing that it possesses another quality--that of the association of\r\nideas (stimuli and reflexes).\r\n\r\nAll of these operations are, in their beginnings, exceedingly simple;\r\nyet, as organisms increase in complexity, these simple beginnings become\r\nmore complex and more highly developed.\r\n\r\nHeretofore, the operations described have been entirely ganglionic\r\n(reflex) and utterly without that which we call consciousness. Now, since\r\nconsciousness, as I understand it, is simply a knowledge of existence, and\r\nsince this knowledge of existence is only to be had through sensual\r\nperceptions, and, since sensual perceptions are excited undoubtedly by\r\ncooerdinated stimuli, then, \"there cannot be cooerdination of many stimuli\r\nwithout some ganglion through which they are all brought into relation.\r\nIn the process of bringing these into relation, this ganglion must be\r\nsubject to the influence of each--must undergo many changes. And the quick\r\nsuccession of changes in a ganglion, implying as it does perpetual\r\nexperiences of differences and likenesses, constitute the raw material of\r\nconsciousness.\"[27]\r\n\r\n  [27] Spencer, _Principles of Psychology_, Vol. I. p. 435.\r\n\r\nHowever quick this succession of changes may be, there must be an\r\ninterval of time between the application of the stimulus and the\r\nresponse to that stimulus, hence, the element of time enters into all\r\npsychical operations that are not distinctly reflex. Even in the\r\nreflexes there is a time element, but it is distinctly shorter than the\r\ntime interval that enters into the make-up of a conscious psychical\r\noperation. This can easily be demonstrated, as has been done, time and\r\nagain, by actual experiment.\r\n\r\n\"With this gradual dawn of consciousness as revealed to subjective\r\nanalysis, we should expect some facts of physiology, or of objective\r\nanalysis, to correspond; and this we do find. For in our own organisms we\r\nknow that reflex actions are not accompanied by consciousness, although\r\nthe complexity of the nerve-muscular systems concerned in these actions\r\nmay be very considerable. Clearly, therefore, it is not mere complexity of\r\nganglionic action that determines consciousness. What, then, is the\r\ndifference between the mode of operation of the cerebral hemispheres and\r\nthat of the lower ganglia, which may be taken to correspond with the great\r\nsubjective distinction between the consciousness which may attend the\r\nformer and the no-consciousness which is invariably characteristic of the\r\nlatter? I think that the only difference that can be pointed to is a\r\ndifference of rate of time.\"[28]\r\n\r\n  [28] Romanes, _Mental Evolution in Animals_, pp. 72, 73.\r\n\r\nThe gradual cultivation of the senses (evolution), during which the\r\nspecial adaptations of their motor reactions are gradually developed, is a\r\nnecessary prerequisite to the formation and elaboration of conscious\r\nvolition.[29] In the foregoing pages I have very briefly discussed this\r\ncultivation of the senses and the development of their motor reactions. I\r\nhave likewise outlined the origin of volition from sensual perceptions; it\r\nnow becomes necessary in this discussion of mind, in the lower animals, to\r\nstudy those organisms in which volition (choice) first makes its\r\nappearance in the shape of conscious determination.\r\n\r\n  [29] Maudsley, _Physiology of Mind_, p. 247.\r\n\r\n_Stentor polymorphus_ is exceedingly interesting on more than one\r\naccount. Its queer, trumpet-like shape, with its flaring, bell-like,\r\nopen mouth (if I may use such a term to indicate its entire cephalic\r\nextremity), surmounted by rows of vibratile cilia, its pulsating\r\ncontractile vesicle, its ability to move from place to place by\r\nswimming, are all interesting features; but, when it is ascertained to\r\nbe the first creature in the entire Animal Kingdom in which a true\r\nnervous system is to be found, then it becomes doubly interesting.\r\n\r\nThis protozoan has been a favorite subject for study with microscopists,\r\nbut Professor Clark of Harvard was the first observer to note and call\r\nattention to its nerve-supply. Says he in his note calling attention to\r\nthis discovery:--\r\n\r\n\"The digestive and circulatory systems are the only parts of the\r\norganization essential to life that are known to investigators; but\r\nrecently I have been led to believe that I have discovered the _nervous\r\nsystem_, or at least a part of it, and that too in the very region of\r\nthe body where there is the most activity, and therefore more likely\r\nthan elsewhere to have this system most strongly developed. Immediately\r\nwithin the edge of the disk (_bell_) there runs all around a narrow\r\nfaint band, which lies so close to the surface that it is difficult to\r\ndetermine precisely that it is not actually superficial. From this band\r\nthere arise, at nearly equal distances all round, about a dozen\r\nexcessively faint thin stripes, which converge in a general direction\r\ntoward the mouth.\"[30]\r\n\r\n  [30] Clark, _Mind in Nature_, pp. 64, 65.\r\n\r\nThis band Professor Clark very correctly, as I believe, assumes to be a\r\npart of Stentor's nervous system; for, with a medium high-power lens\r\n(x500) I have been able to make out ganglionic enlargements both in the\r\ncircular band and in the stripes. These ganglia are the brain of this\r\ninfusorian. When the animalcule is stained with eosin, the nervous\r\nsystem can very readily be made out and followed throughout all of its\r\nramifications.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, while I was studying the contractile vesicle (heart) of\r\none of these animalcules, I saw it evince what seemed to me to be\r\nunquestionable evidences of conscious determination.\r\n\r\nJust above the creature, which was resting in its tube (it builds a\r\ngelatinous tube into which it shrinks when alarmed or disturbed in any\r\nway), there was a bit of alga, from which ripened spores were being given\r\noff. Some of these spores were ruptured (probably by my manipulations) and\r\nstarch grains were escaping therefrom.\r\n\r\nThe Stentor, from its location below the alga, could not reach the\r\nstarch grains without altering its position. I saw it elevate itself in\r\nits tube until it touched the starch grains with its cilia. With these\r\nit swept a grain into its mouth, and then sank down in its tube. I\r\nthought, at first, that this was the result of accident, but when the\r\ncreature again elevated itself, and again captured a starch grain, I was\r\ncompelled to admit design!\r\n\r\nBy some sense, it had discovered the presence of starch, which it\r\nrecognized to be food; it could not get at this food without making a\r\nchange in its position, which, therefore, it immediately proceeded to\r\ndo!\r\n\r\nHere was an act which required, so it seemed to me, correlative\r\nideation, and which was doubly surprising, because occurring in an\r\nanimal of such extremely simple organization. This observation was\r\nsubstantiated, however, by the testimony of Professor Carter, an English\r\nbiologist, which came to my notice a week or so thereafter. This\r\ninvestigator witnessed a similar act in an animalcule belonging, it is\r\ntrue, to another family, but which is almost, if not quite, as simple in\r\nits organization as Stentor. He does not designate the particular\r\nrhizopods that he had under observation, yet from his language, we are\r\nable to classify them approximately. His account is so very interesting\r\nthat I take the liberty of quoting him in full.\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion, while investigating the nature of some large,\r\ntransparent, spore-like elliptical cells (fungal?) whose protoplasm was\r\nrotating, while it was at the same time charged with triangular grains\r\nof starch, I observed some actinophorous rhizopods creeping about them,\r\nwhich had similar shaped grains of starch in their interior; and having\r\ndetermined the nature of these grains by the addition of iodine, I\r\ncleansed the glasses, and placed under the microscope a new portion of\r\nthe sediment from the basin containing these cells and actinophryans for\r\nfurther examination, when I observed one of the spore-like cells had\r\nbecome ruptured, and that a portion of its protoplasm, charged with the\r\ntriangular starch grains, was slightly protruding through the crevice.\r\nIt then struck me that the actinophryans had obtained their starch\r\ngrains from this source; and while looking at the ruptured cell, an\r\n_actinophrys_ made its appearance, and creeping round the cell, at last\r\narrived at the crevice, from which it extricated one of the grains of\r\nstarch mentioned, and then crept off to a good distance. Presently,\r\nhowever, it returned to the same cell; and although there were now no\r\nmore starch grains protruding, the _actinophrys_ managed again to\r\nextract one from the interior through the crevice. All this was repeated\r\nseveral times, showing that the _actinophrys_ instinctively knew that\r\nthose were nutritious grains, that they were contained in this cell, and\r\nthat, although each time after incepting a grain it went away to some\r\ndistance, it knew how to find its way back to the cell again which\r\nfurnished this nutriment.\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion I saw an _actinophrys_ station itself close to a\r\nripe spore-cell of _pythium_, which was situated on a filament of\r\n_Spirogyra crassa_; and as the young ciliated monadic germs issued forth\r\none after another from the dehiscent spore-cell, the _actinophrys_\r\nremained by it and caught every one of them, even to the last, when it\r\nretired to another part of the field, as if instinctively conscious that\r\nthere was nothing more to be got at the old place.\r\n\r\n\"But by far the greatest feat of this kind that ever presented itself to\r\nme was the catching of a young _acineta_ by an old sluggish _amoeba_,\r\nas the former left its parent; this took place as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In the evening of the 2d of June, 1858, in Bombay, while looking\r\nthrough a microscope at some _Euglenae_, etc., which had been placed\r\naside for examination in a watch-glass, my eye fell upon a stalked and\r\ntriangular _acineta_ (_A. mystacina?_), around which an _amoeba_ was\r\ncreeping and lingering, as they do when they are in quest of food. But\r\nknowing the antipathy that the _amoeba_, like almost every other\r\ninfusorian, has to the tentacles of the _acineta_, I concluded that the\r\n_amoeba_ was not encouraging an appetite for its whiskered companion,\r\nwhen I was surprised to find that it crept up the stem of the _acineta_,\r\nand wound itself round its body.\r\n\r\n\"This mark of affection, too much like that frequently evinced at the\r\nother end of the scale, even where there is mind for its control, did\r\nnot long remain without interpretation. There was a young _acineta_,\r\ntender and without poisonous tentacles (for they are not developed at\r\nbirth), just ready to make its exit from its parent, an exit which takes\r\nplace so quickly, and is followed by such rapid bounding movements of\r\nthe non-ciliated _acineta_, that who would venture to say, _a priori_,\r\nthat a dull, heavy, sluggish _amoeba_ could catch such an agile little\r\nthing? But the _amoebae_ are as unerring and unrelaxing in their grasp\r\nas they are unrelenting in their cruel inceptions of the living and the\r\ndead, when they serve them for nutrition; and thus the _amoeba_,\r\nplacing itself around the ovarian aperture of the _acineta_, received\r\nthe young one, nurse-like, in its fatal lap, incepted it, descended from\r\nthe parent, and crept off. Being unable to conceive at the time that\r\nthis was such an act of atrocity on the part of the _amoeba_ as the\r\nsequel disclosed, and thinking that the young _acineta_ might yet\r\nescape, or pass into some other form in the body of its host, I watched\r\nthe _amoeba_ for some time afterwards, until the tale ended by the\r\nyoung _acineta_ becoming divided into two parts, and thus in their\r\nrespective digestive spaces ultimately becoming broken down and\r\ndigested.\"[31]\r\n\r\n  [31] Carter, _Annals of Natural History_, 3d Series, 1863, pp. 45, 46;\r\n  quoted also by Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, pp. 20, 21.\r\n\r\nIn the discussion of conscious and unconscious mind, I called attention\r\nto the marginal bodies of the nectocalyx of the jelly-fish. These bodies\r\nin the \"covered-eyed\" species are protected by hoods of gelatinous\r\ntissue; in the naked-eyed species the hoods are absent. The marginal\r\nbodies in both species are practically identical as far as general\r\nmake-up is concerned, being composed of an accumulation of\r\nbrightly-colored pigment-cells, embedded in which are several minute\r\nclear crystals. Nerve-fibres connect these bodies with the sensorium\r\n(\"nerve-ring\").\r\n\r\nJelly-fish seek the light, and they can be made to follow a bright light\r\nfrom one side of the aquarium to the other by manipulating the light in\r\nthe proper manner. Even where a slight current is set up in the water,\r\nthey will swim against it in their efforts to reach the light.\r\n\r\nWhen two or more of the marginal bodies are excised, no effect seems to\r\nfollow such excision, but as soon as the last of these bodies is cut\r\nout, the creature falls to the bottom of the tank without motion.\r\n\r\nWhen a point in the nectocalyx is irritated with a point of a needle or\r\nby a vegetable or mineral irritant, the tip of the manubrium will turn\r\ntoward, and endeavor to touch, the spot irritated. It does not turn at\r\nonce, as it would were its movements the result of reflex action; it\r\nmoves deliberately as though actuated by volition.\r\n\r\nThe above experiments and observation seem to indicate the presence of\r\nconscious determination in the medusa; in fact, there seems to be a\r\ndistinct element of choice in these psychical manifestations.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in watching a water-louse, I saw it swim to a hydra, tear\r\noff one of its buds, and then swim some distance away to a small bit of\r\nmud, behind which it hid until it devoured its tender morsel. Again it\r\nswam back to the hydra and plucked from it one of its young; again it\r\nswam back to the little mud heap, behind which it once more ensconced\r\nitself until it was through with its meal. When we remember that this\r\nlittle creature was among entirely new surroundings (for I dipped it\r\nfrom a pond in a tablespoon full of water which I had poured into a\r\nsaucer), we will appreciate the fact that the water-louse evinced\r\nconscious determination and no little memory. It probably discovered the\r\nhydra accidentally; it then, as soon as it had secured its prey, swam\r\naway, seeking some spot where it could eat its food without molestation.\r\nBut when it sought the hydra again and swam back to its sheltering mud\r\nheap, it showed that it remembered the route to and from its source of\r\nfood supply and its temporary hiding-place.\r\n\r\nAt the base of a large terminal ganglion in the neuro-cephalic system of\r\nthe common garden snail, lying immediately below and between its two\r\n\"horns,\" will be found, I am satisfied, the centre governing its sense\r\nof direction. For, when this portion of this ganglion is destroyed, the\r\nsnail loses its ability of returning to its home when carried only a\r\nshort distance away; otherwise, it can find its way back to its domicile\r\nwhen taken what must be to it a very great distance away, indeed.\r\nBeneath the stone coping of a brick wall surrounding the front of my\r\nlawn, and which, on the side toward my residence, is almost flush with\r\nthe ground, many garden snails find a cool, moist, and congenial home.\r\nLast summer I took six of these snails, and, after marking them with a\r\npaint of zinc oxide and gum arabic, set them free on the lawn. In time,\r\nfour of these marked snails returned to their home beneath the stone\r\ncoping; two of them were probably destroyed by enemies. Again, the same\r\nnumber of snails were marked, after the base of the above-mentioned\r\nganglion had been destroyed, and likewise set free. Although they lived\r\nand were to be observed now and then on the trees and bushes of the\r\nlawn, none of them ever returned to the place from which they were taken\r\nbeneath the stone coping. I have performed this experiment repeatedly,\r\nalways with like results.\r\n\r\nThese experiments show that the snail is capable of conscious effort;\r\nfurthermore, they indicate that this little animal is the possessor of a\r\nspecial sense which many of the higher animals have lost in the process\r\nof evolution. I refer to the sense of direction, or \"homing instinct,\"\r\nso-called, which will be treated at length in the chapter on Auxiliary\r\nSenses.\r\n\r\nDarwin has very beautifully demonstrated the senses of touch, taste, and\r\nsmell in the angle-worm; provisionally he denies it, however, the senses\r\nof sight and hearing.[32] I think he is in error as to these last two\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n  [32] Darwin, _Formation of Vegetable Mould_.\r\n\r\nAngle-worms are nocturnal in their habits, hence, we should expect, from\r\nthe very nature of things, to find them able to differentiate between\r\nlight and darkness. And experiments show, very conclusively, that they\r\nare very sensitive to light. My vermicularium is made of glass,\r\nconsequently, when one of its inmates happens to be next to the glass\r\nsides, which very frequently occurs, it is easy to experiment on it with\r\npencils of strong light. If a ray of light is directed upon an\r\nangle-worm, it at once begins to show discomfort, and, in a very few\r\nmoments, it will crawl away from the source of annoyance, and hide in\r\nsome tunnel deep in the earth of the vermicularium. Again, when the\r\nworms are out of their tunnels at night, a strong light shining on them\r\nwill at once cause them to seek their holes.\r\n\r\nIf the back of an earthworm be examined with a high-power lens (x500),\r\nsmall points of pigment will be seen here and there in its dorsal\r\nintegument; these, I believe, are primitive eyes (ocelli). I think that\r\nthe worm is enabled to tell the difference between light and darkness\r\nthrough the agency of these minute dark spots, which serve to arrest the\r\nrays of light, thus conveying a stimulus to nerve-fibrils, which, in\r\nturn, carry it to the sensorium.\r\n\r\nAny country schoolboy will tell you that worms can hear. He points to\r\nhis simple experiment (pounding on the earth with a club) in proof of\r\nhis assertion. For, as soon as he begins to pound the ground in a\r\nfavorable neighborhood, the worms will come to the surface \"to see what\r\nmakes the noise.\" Darwin assumes that the worms feel the vibrations,\r\nwhich are disagreeable to them, and come to the surface in order to\r\nescape them. I do not deny the possibility or the probability of this\r\nassumption; I do deny, however, that it proves that worms are deaf.\r\n\r\nIf the third anal segment (abdominal aspect) of a worm be examined, two\r\nround, disk-like organs incorporated in the integument will be found;\r\nthese organs are supplied with special nerves which lead to the central\r\nnerve-cord. Experiments lead me to believe that these are organs of\r\naudition.\r\n\r\nWhen I tap the earth of my vermicularium with a pencil, the unmutilated\r\nworms will come to the surface; but, when the organs described above are\r\nremoved, the worms so mutilated will not respond to the tapping, but\r\nwill remain in their tunnel. The worms are not appreciably impaired by\r\nsuch mutilation; on the contrary, they seem to thrive as well as those\r\nto which the knife has not been applied.\r\n\r\nIn creatures which possess, in all probability, the senses of touch,\r\ntaste, smell, sight, and hearing, we would naturally expect to find some\r\nevidences of conscious determination; and we do.\r\n\r\nCertain leaves are the favorite food of earth-worms, while certain other\r\nleaves are eaten by them, but not with avidity. When these two kinds of\r\nleaves are given to worms, they will carefully select the favorite food\r\nand will ignore the other, thus unmistakably evincing conscious choice.\r\nTheir avoidance of light is probably the result of conscious\r\ndetermination, and not reflex, as some observers maintain.\r\n\r\nOysters taken from a bank never uncovered by the sea, open their shells,\r\nlose the water within, and soon die; but oysters kept in a reservoir and\r\noccasionally uncovered learn to keep their shells closed, and live much\r\nlonger when taken out of the water. This is an act of intelligence due\r\ndirectly to experience without even the factor of heredity.[33] It is an\r\ninstance of almost immediate adaptation to surrounding circumstances.\r\n\r\n  [33] Dicquemase, _Journal de Physique_, Vol. XXVIII. p. 244; quoted\r\n  also by Darwin, MS.; by Bingley, _Animal Biography_, Vol. III. p. 454;\r\n  and by Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, p. 25.\r\n\r\nA gentleman fixed a land-snail, with the mouth of the shell upward, in a\r\nchink of a rock. The animal protruded its foot to the utmost extent,\r\nand, attaching it above, tried to pull the shell vertically in a\r\nstraight line. Then it stretched its body to the right side, pulled, and\r\nfailed to move the shell. It then stretched its foot to the left side,\r\npulled with all of its strength, and released the shell. There were\r\nintervals of rest between these several attempts, during which the snail\r\nremained quiescent.[34] Thus we see that it exerted force in three\r\ndirections, never twice in the same direction, which fact shows\r\nconscious determination and no slight degree of intelligence.\r\n\r\n  [34] Consult Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, p. 26.\r\n\r\nA ground wasp once built a nest beneath the brick pavement in front of\r\nmy door. The entrance of the nest was situated in the little sulcus, or\r\nditch, between two bricks. While the wasp was absent, I stopped the\r\nentrance with a pellet of paper, and, when the little housekeeper\r\nreturned, she was nonplussed for a moment or two, when she discovered\r\nthat her doorway had been closed. The wasp, after examining the pellet\r\nof paper, seized it with her jaws and tried to pull it away; but, since\r\nshe stood on the brick and pulled backwards (toward herself), the edge\r\nof the brick interposed, and she could not dislodge the obstacle.\r\nFinally, she got down into the little gully between the two bricks, and\r\npulled the pellet away from the opening of the nest without any further\r\ntrouble. Three times I performed the experiment, the wasp going through\r\nlike performances each time. At the fourth time, however, she went at\r\nonce into the little space between the bricks, and then removed the wad\r\nof paper without difficulty. I stopped the hole five or six times after\r\nthis, but she had learned a lesson; she always got into the sulcus\r\nbetween the bricks before attempting to remove the paper. She had\r\ndiscovered the fact that she could not remove it when she stood upon the\r\nsurfaces of the bricks, owing to the interposition of their sides, and\r\nthat she could drag it away if she got down into the little ditch and\r\npulled the paper in a direction where nothing opposed. In this instance\r\nthere was not only conscious determination, but also a distinct\r\nexhibition of memory. It took the wasp some time to learn that she had\r\nto pull in a certain direction before she could remove the pellet of\r\npaper; but when she had once learned this fact, she remembered it. And\r\nthis brings us to another quality of mind--memory--which will be\r\ndiscussed in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMEMORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn discussing memory as it is to be observed in the lower animals, I\r\nthink it best to divide the subject into four parts; viz., _Memory of\r\nLocality_ (_Surroundings_), _Memory of Friends_ (_Kindred_), _Memory of\r\nStrangers_ (_Other Animals not Kin_), and _Memory of Events_\r\n(_Education_, _Happenings_, _etc._).\r\n\r\n_Memory of Locality._--There can be no doubt but that the rhizopods\r\nobserved by Carter displayed memory of locality. He distinctly asserts\r\nthat he saw the actinophrys, after it had incepted a starch grain,\r\n\"crawl away to a good distance\" and then return to the spore-cell from\r\nwhich it was taking the grains of starch. The creature must have\r\nremembered the route to and from the spore-cell. The same must be said\r\nof the water-louse observed by myself, which not only came back to the\r\nsource of its food-supply, but also returned to a certain lurking-spot\r\nat which it hid itself each time until it had eaten the hydra buds. It\r\nmust be remembered that a journey of one inch, to these minute little\r\ncreatures, is, comparatively speaking, an immense distance. Each grain\r\nof sand, each particle of decayed vegetable matter, etc., is, to these\r\nmicroscopic animalcules, a gigantic boulder, a mighty muck heap. These\r\nobstacles in the path undoubtedly serve as landmarks to the wandering\r\nmyriads of microscopic animalcules.\r\n\r\nIt can be demonstrated that the snail has memory of locality. This\r\ncreature is essentially a homing animal, as I will show in the chapter\r\non Auxiliary Senses, consequently we would naturally expect to find it\r\npossessing memory of locality. An interesting observation by Mr.\r\nLonsdale, an English observer, which has been often quoted, clearly\r\nproves that this creature does possess this psychical function. Mr.\r\nLonsdale placed two snails in a small and badly kept garden. One of them\r\nwas weak and poorly nourished, the other strong and well. The strong one\r\ndisappeared and was traced by its slimy track over a wall into a\r\nneighboring garden where there was plenty of food. Mr. Lonsdale thought\r\nthat it had deserted its mate, but it subsequently appeared and\r\nconducted its comrade over the wall into the bountiful food-supply of\r\nthe neighboring garden. It seemed to coax and assist its feeble\r\ncompanion when it lingered on the way.[35]\r\n\r\n  [35] Darwin, _Descent of Man_, pp. 262, 263.\r\n\r\nMarked bees and ants invariably return to places where they have found\r\nfood-supplies, thus showing the possession of a memory of locality and\r\nroute. It is very interesting to watch a marked ant during her journey\r\nback to her nest, after she has been carried away and placed among\r\nunfamiliar scenes and surroundings. At first, owing to her fright, she\r\nwill dash away helter-skelter; but soon recovering, she will head in the\r\ndirection of home, and moderate her pace until she creeps along at a\r\nvery cautious and circumspect gait, indeed. Every now and then she will\r\nclimb a tall grass-blade or weed and take observations. After a while\r\nshe sees certain landmarks, and her speed becomes faster; soon the\r\nsurrounding country becomes familiar, and she ceases to climb blades of\r\ngrass, etc., now she is in the midst of well-known scenes, and at last\r\nshe fairly races into her nest.\r\n\r\nIn this instance the ant is led at first by her sense of direction\r\nalone; as soon, however, as she comes to country which she has hunted\r\nover, and with which she is familiar, memory comes into play and the\r\nsense of direction ceases to act, or, if it acts at all, it acts\r\nunconsciously.\r\n\r\nSand-wasps build their nests in the ground, and, when leaving their\r\ntunnels in search of food for the prospective grubs, always circle about\r\nthem and observe the lay of the land before taking their departure.\r\nNumerous sand-wasps build in the interstices between the bricks of a\r\npavement in front of my house. When one leaves her tunnel she will fly\r\nabout the orifice for several seconds (taking observations) before she\r\nfinally flies away. When she returns, she hovers about the orifice, or,\r\nrather, in its neighborhood, until she is quite certain that it is the\r\nentrance to her home, when she will dart in with such rapidity that the\r\neye can scarcely follow her movements.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, I covered the pavement surrounding the entrance with\r\nnewspapers, leaving, however, about three inches on all sides of the\r\norifice uncovered. When the wasp returned she seemed to be completely at\r\na loss what to do. She hovered about for at least an hour, and then flew\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThinking that this experiment was too great a tax on the wasp's\r\nintelligence, I tried the following, which seemed to me to be nearer a\r\nnatural happening than the former experiment. I believe that, in\r\nstudying mind in the lower animals, one's experiments should be as near\r\nnature as they can possibly be.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the wasp had left her tunnel, I covered the surface of the\r\nbricks and the interstices between them, for several feet around the\r\norifice of the tunnel, with sand. This might have happened, naturally,\r\nthrough the agency of the wind.\r\n\r\nWhen the wasp returned, it was perfectly apparent that she did not\r\nrecognize her domicile. She flew here and there and round about, but she\r\nwould not alight. Finally, I swept the sand away, when she at once flew\r\nto her nest and entered.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, these experiments prove very clearly the presence of\r\nmemory of locality in these insects. The sense of direction, which a\r\nvast majority of the lower animals possess in some degree, is, however,\r\nof material assistance to their memory; this special sense will be fully\r\ndiscussed in another chapter.\r\n\r\nMost of the beetles are homing animals; that is, they have certain spots\r\nto which they will return after excursions in search of food.\r\nHeretofore, observers have held to the opinion that beetles made their\r\nhomes wherever they happened to be; but close study of marked\r\nindividuals, especially of _Carabidae_ and _Cicindelidae_ has taught me\r\notherwise. Some of the long-horned beetles appear to be rovers, but\r\nthese are always males, and their roving habits are due to sexual\r\npromptings. The females are, however, to a great extent, homing animals,\r\nand do not wander far after they have once established a home. Being\r\ncreatures which recognize certain surroundings as home, they must,\r\nnecessarily, have some memory of locality. This proposition is new,\r\nbeing formulated and advanced by myself alone, therefore I expect that\r\nit will be negatived by many investigators. All that I ask, however, is\r\nthat _marked_ specimens of the different genera be closely watched; I am\r\nconfident that if this plan be followed, the truthfulness of this\r\nproposition will soon be universally acknowledged.\r\n\r\nReptiles and certain fishes are homing animals, and this habit is\r\nespecially noticeable in the land or box terrapin. One of these animals\r\nhad its home for many years in my lawn, and I have often satisfied\r\nmyself in regard to its knowledge of locality. I have frequently taken\r\nit several hundred yards (its usual \"using-place\" is circumscribed at\r\nabout one hundred yards) away from its home and set it free.\r\n\r\nAt first, led by its sense of direction, it would turn towards home and\r\nslowly crawl in that direction. It would not feed _en route_, but seemed\r\nintent only on arriving at its home as quickly as possible. Finally,\r\nwhen it arrived among familiar surroundings, it would begin to feed, but\r\nwould still make its way homeward. It clearly and unmistakably indicated\r\nby its actions that it had a memory of locality.\r\n\r\nThis treatise on mind in the lower animals is, mainly, a study of\r\npsychical manifestations as they are to be observed in insects;\r\ntherefore, the higher animals will only be studied incidentally. Suffice\r\nit to say that, among the higher animals, evidences of memory of\r\nlocality are very abundant, and are so patent that they do not need\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\n_Memory of Friends_ (_Kindred_).--This phase of mind in ants has been\r\nclosely studied and graphically described by Sir John Lubbock. Most of\r\nhis experiments and observations have been verified by myself, therefore\r\nthe reader will pardon me if I quote freely from his valuable work,\r\n_Ants, Bees, and Wasps_.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Huber, Ford, Lubbock, and other observers declare\r\nthat ants can remember and recognize their kindred after having been\r\nseparated from them for several months. \"Huber mentions that some ants\r\nwhich he had kept in captivity having accidentally escaped, met and\r\nrecognized their former companions, fell to mutual caresses with their\r\nantennae, took them up by their mandibles, and led them to their own\r\nnests; they came presently in a crowd to seek the fugitives under and\r\nabout the artificial ant-hill, and even ventured to reach the\r\nbell-glass, where they effected a complete desertion by carrying away\r\nsuccessively all the ants they found there. In a few days, the ruche was\r\ndepopulated. These ants had remained four months without any\r\ncommunication.\"[36]\r\n\r\n  [36] Huber, p. 172; quoted by Lubbock, _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_, p.\r\n  120; also by Kirby and Spence, _Introduction to Entomology_, Vol. III.\r\n  p. 66; also by Newport, _Trans. Ent. Soc._, London, Vol. II. p. 239.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, I took ten _Lasius niger_ and confined them in a\r\nspecially constructed formicary so that they could not possibly leave\r\nthe nest. I supplied these colonists with a gravid queen, so they very\r\nquickly became satisfied with their new home. Four months thereafter, I\r\nput three of these ants, previously marked with a paint of zinc oxide\r\nand gum arabic, into their former nest. They were at once recognized by\r\ntheir kindred, which began to caress them with their antennae and to\r\nremove the paint from their bodies. In the course of a half hour, the\r\npaint had all been removed, and I lost sight of them among the other\r\nants.\r\n\r\nA month after the performance of this experiment, I took three marked\r\nants from the parent nest and placed them in the new nest. They were at\r\nonce recognized by the colonists, which received them, as it were, with\r\nopen arms and began to cleanse their bodies by removing the paint. In\r\nboth of these experiments the recognition appeared to be instantaneous;\r\nthere was no hesitancy whatever.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when performing like experiments with _Lasius\r\nflavus_, it took the ants (on two occasions) some little time to\r\nrecognize their kindred; when the marked ants were put into the nest\r\nthey were at once seized by the other ants, which pulled them about the\r\nnest for some time. They were finally recognized, however, and the paint\r\nremoved from their bodies by the busy little tongues of their kindred.\r\n\r\nThis would seem to indicate that _Lasius niger_ had a better memory than\r\n_Lasius flavus_; whether the failure of the latter to recognize their\r\nfriends at once was due, however, to faulty memory or not, is a\r\npsychical problem that will, probably, never be solved.\r\n\r\nLubbock's experiments with _Myrmica ruginodis_ clearly demonstrate that\r\nthese ants can recognize their kin. Says he:--\r\n\r\n\"On August 20, 1875, I divided a colony of _Myrmica ruginodis_ so that\r\none half were in one nest, A, and the other half in another, B, and were\r\nkept entirely apart.\r\n\r\n\"On October 3, I put into nest B a stranger and an old companion from\r\nnest A. They were marked with a spot of color. One of them immediately\r\nflew at the stranger; of the friend they took no notice.\r\n\r\n\"October 18.--At 10 A.M. I put in a stranger and a friend from nest A.\r\nIn the evening the former was killed, the latter was quite at home.\r\n\r\n\"October 19.--I put one in a small bottle with a friend from nest A.\r\nThey did not show any enmity. I then put in a stranger, and one of them\r\nimmediately began to fight with her.\"[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] Lubbock, _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_, p. 121 _et seq._\r\n\r\nThese experiments show that _Myrmica ruginodis_ recognize their kin at\r\nsight, and that they are able to remember and recognize one another\r\nafter long separations.\r\n\r\nLubbock states that _Lasius flavus_ accept others of the same species as\r\ntheir friends, no matter how great a distance lies between the nests.\r\nHis experiments were made with ants taken from contiguous nests as well\r\nas those located some distance apart, and, in one instance, with ants\r\ntaken from a nest in another part of the country. He states that, in\r\nthe last-mentioned experiment, \"in one or two cases they seemed to be\r\nattacked, though so feebly that I could not feel sure about it; but in\r\nno case were the ants killed.\"[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] Lubbock, _loc. cit. ante_, p. 124.\r\n\r\nMy experiments and observations with this ant are directly the reverse.\r\nAs long as the individuals experimented with belonged to contiguous\r\nnests, and were, probably, derived from the same root-stock, there was\r\nno fighting; but, in the case of ants taken from opposite sides of the\r\nhouse, which, probably, sprang from two different sources, there was,\r\ninvariably, much fighting, in which not a few of the combatants lost\r\ntheir lives. Whether or not the American species of _Lasius flavus_ are\r\nnaturally more pugnacious than the English species, I know not; if they\r\nare, then this fact will account for the difference in behavior of the\r\ntwo species to a certain extent, though not entirely.\r\n\r\nOthers of the social Hymenoptera--for instance, bees and wasps--remember\r\nkindred. On one occasion, I clipped the wings of a wasp, and, after she\r\nhad learned that she could no longer fly, placed her on a strange nest.\r\nShe was at once attacked, and was soon stung to death. I kept a wasp\r\nconfined in a glass for three weeks, carefully feeding her meanwhile,\r\nand then placed her on the nest from which she had been taken. She was\r\nat once recognized by the other wasps, which caressed her with their\r\nantennae, and licked her with their tongues.\r\n\r\nBees, though they seem able to recognize kindred, and to remember them\r\nalso for some time, do not show these faculties of the mind as plainly\r\nas do wasps and ants. This is probably due to the fact that bees are a\r\nlater development, socially speaking, and are not as psychically mature\r\nas the other social insects.\r\n\r\nIn the higher animals the memory of kindred, especially in monkeys, is\r\nquite well developed, and is so well known that it does not need\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\n_Memory of Strangers_ (_Animals other than Kin_).--The recognition of\r\nenemies can be noticed in animals quite low in the scale of life, and,\r\nalthough this psychical phase is almost universally instinctive, it\r\ncarries with it certain elements of consciousness. As we ascend the\r\nscale, however, we discover that certain animals are capable of\r\nremembering other animals after a hostile encounter with them; thus, a\r\npet squirrel remembered the turtle which had bitten him after two years\r\nhad elapsed, and a white mouse showed, very plainly, that he had not\r\nforgotten the pet crow from whose clutches he had been rescued, even\r\nafter three years had passed by. I might enumerate quite a number of\r\ninstances like these, but think it hardly necessary; any one who has\r\npaid any attention to natural history has seen evidences of this phase\r\nof memory in animals. I will, however, give one more illustration of\r\nthis form of memory, which, in my opinion, is quite remarkable. In my\r\nfront yard, last summer, there dwelt a large colony of bumblebees. One\r\nday, in a moment of idleness, I tossed a tennis ball, with which I was\r\nteaching a young dog to retrieve, into the nest. The dog dashed after\r\nit, scratching up the ground and barking loudly; immediately the bees\r\nsallied forth, pounced upon the dog and stung him severely. During the\r\nentire summer this dog could never come near the nest without being\r\nstung; his companions, two in number, trotted to and fro on the path\r\nnear which the nest was located without being noticed in the slightest\r\ndegree by the bees. The disturber, and, to them, would-be ravisher and\r\ndestroyer of their home, however, was always assailed and put to flight.\r\nHe eventually learned to give that portion of the yard a wide berth, and\r\ncould not be coaxed into coming within thirty yards of the home of his\r\nsavage little foes.\r\n\r\nInstances of memory of individuals, incited by friendship or regard,\r\nbetween animals of different species is quite rare among the lower\r\nanimals (insects, reptiles, etc.), yet, I have fortunately been able to\r\nnote this phase of memory as occurring in several animals, comparatively\r\nspeaking, low in the scale of intellectual development. I have every\r\nreason for believing that even the toad remembers individuals, at\r\nleast, it remembers the sound of some particular voice or whistle. It\r\nmost certainly remembers localities and places, and that, too, when\r\nunaided by its sense of direction which it possesses in a high degree. A\r\ntoad which I had under observation, and which I was in the habit of\r\nfeeding, would come at my call or whistle, and this it learned to do\r\nafter only two weeks of teaching. It would do this even in the middle of\r\na hot summer day (toads feed at dusk and during the night), showing,\r\nthereby, that it remembered that this call meant food.\r\n\r\nI have strong reasons for believing that certain spiders possess this\r\nphase of memory; at least, a certain lycosid once evinced such\r\nunmistakable evidences of a recognition of my individual person, that\r\nmore than one observer became convinced that she knew me from other\r\npeople. At the time these observations were made, I was confined to the\r\nhouse by sickness.\r\n\r\nIn my room and dwelling beneath my table was a large black spider, one\r\nof the most beautiful of her species. When I first made her acquaintance\r\nshe was very timid, and would run to her den if I made the slightest\r\nmotion. As time passed, however, she grew bolder and would come to the\r\nedge of the table which was close beside my bed, and regard me intently\r\nwith her beady black eyes. Finally she became so tame that she would\r\ntake flies and insects from my fingers. She learned to know me so well\r\nthat she could easily tell the difference when others came into the\r\nroom. When I would leave the room for a short outing, on my return I\r\nwould find her waiting for me on the top of the table. When others\r\nentered the room, she would hide herself in her den, and remain there,\r\nvery frequently, until they took their departure.\r\n\r\nIt has been known for quite a while that in the nests of ants there are\r\nalways to be found other insects, which appear to dwell in perfect\r\nharmony with the real builders and owners of the domiciles. Some of\r\nthese creatures (the aphides, for instance) are brought into the nests\r\nby the ants themselves, which use them as we do cows, milking from their\r\nbodies a clear, sweet fluid, which they greedily lap up with their\r\ntongues. But there are other animals in the teeming formicary which seem\r\nto subserve no useful purpose other than that of ministering to the\r\nants' love of pets or playmates. One notable little alien in certain ant\r\ncommunities is a minute claviger beetle (so called from its peculiar\r\nclaviger, or club-shaped antennae), which seems to be a well-beloved\r\nfriend and companion, and which is always treated with great\r\nkindness.[39] These little beetles sometimes leave the nest, and may be\r\nobserved sunning themselves at the entrance. The busy workers are never\r\nso busy but that they can spend a fraction of a second for the purpose\r\nof caressing their diminutive playmates. On one occasion, a swarm was\r\nabout to take place in one of my formicaries. The young princes and\r\nprincesses had emerged and had congregated about the entrance; they\r\nseemed loath to take wing and fly away on their honeymoon jaunt out into\r\nthe unknown world. The workers were gently urging them to depart,\r\nsometimes even nipping them slightly with their mandibles. Several\r\nlittle clavigers could be seen running here and there and everywhere\r\nthrough the crowd of anxious workers and timid young males and females.\r\nThey irresistibly reminded me of a lot of little dogs in a crowd of men\r\naround some centre of excitement or attraction. I have seen dogs, on\r\nmore than one occasion, act in just such a manner. The ants,\r\nnotwithstanding their evident worry and excitement, seemed to notice\r\ntheir little pets, and to give them, every now and then, an encouraging\r\npat, as it were, on their backs or heads.\r\n\r\n  [39] Consult Lubbock, _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_, pp. 75, 76.\r\n\r\nThe clavigers are not the only pets in a formicary; several other\r\nspecies of beetles and one bug also live in ants' nests, and seem to\r\noccupy places in the affection of the masters of the home akin to those\r\nwhich dogs, cats, and other pets occupy in our own affections.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted, most frequently by superficial observers, however,\r\nthat the reptilian _psychos_ is exceedingly low; this is a popular error,\r\nfor many reptiles give evidence, on occasions, of a, comparatively\r\nspeaking, high degree of intelligence. Especially is this true in regard\r\nto their memory of individuals.\r\n\r\nI kept for some time in my room, some years ago, a male black snake\r\n(_Bascanion constrictor_). Whenever this creature became hungry, he\r\nwould follow me about the room like a dog or a cat. He would wind his\r\nway up my legs and body, until his head was on a level with my own; he\r\nwould then bow repeatedly, darting out his tongue with inconceivable\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nHe would never attempt to crawl up the legs of a visitor (some visitors\r\nknew \"Blacky\" quite well and were not at all afraid of him), thus\r\nshowing that he knew me personally.\r\n\r\nAgain, a friend sent me two Floridian chameleons, which dwelt in my\r\ndesk, and which, in course of time, became very tame. My desk is a\r\ncombination bookcase and writing-table, and these creatures passed most\r\nof their time among the books, changing color so perfectly, especially\r\nwhen alarmed, that it took a very sharp eye indeed to descry them when\r\nthey were quiescent. When I sat at my desk writing they would jump down\r\non my head or shoulders and explore my entire body, running here and\r\nthere and everywhere about me, sometimes tickling me with their sharp\r\nlittle claws until I, too, was forced into making a tour of discovery,\r\nin order to bring them once more to the light. But let a stranger enter\r\nthe room, and, presto! they were gone in the twinkling of an eye. I\r\nleft home on one occasion and was gone for two months. When I came to my\r\nroom and sat down at my desk, I looked about for my little pets, and\r\ncould not see them. I had come to the conclusion that they had either\r\ndied or escaped from the room, when suddenly I saw a tiny little head\r\npeep out from between two books and as suddenly disappear. I pulled out\r\na writing-pad and went to work, keeping a watch, however, for my shy\r\nlittle friends. They gradually became bolder and bolder, until all at\r\nonce they seemed to recognize me, first one and then the other leaping\r\nto my shoulders. In a few moments they were making their usual tour over\r\nmy person. In this instance these lizards remembered me after an absence\r\nof at least two months; it took them about two hours fully to recall my\r\npersonality, yet they did it in the end.\r\n\r\nBirds remember individuals, and testify their love or hatred for such\r\nindividuals in actions that are unmistakable. Thus, an eagle in Central\r\nPark, for some--to me--unknown reason, took a great dislike to myself,\r\nand, whenever I approached its cage, would erect its crest and regard me\r\nin the most belligerent manner. On several occasions it even left its\r\nperch and flew to the bars in its desire to attack me. A large, handsome\r\ngobbler belonging to my mother has shown the house boy that it is war to\r\nthe death between them. This turkey never fails to attack the boy\r\nwhenever opportunity offers; no other person is ever molested by him.\r\n\r\nA lady writes me as follows: \"Last week my brother\" (a lad of twelve)\r\n\"killed a snake which was just in the act of robbing a song-sparrow's\r\nnest. Ever since then, the male sparrow has shown gratitude to George in\r\na truly wonderful manner. When he goes into the garden the sparrow will\r\nfly to him, sometimes alighting on his head, at other times on his\r\nshoulder, all the while pouring out a tumultuous song of praise and\r\ngratitude. It will accompany him about the garden, never leaving him\r\nuntil he reaches the garden gate. George, as you know, is a quiet boy,\r\nwho loves animals, and this may account, in a degree, for the sparrow's\r\nextraordinary actions.\"\r\n\r\nI am perfectly convinced that the nesting birds on my place know me, and\r\nthat they remember me from one nesting-time to another. I have\r\nrepeatedly approached my face to within a foot of setting birds without\r\nalarming them. On one occasion I even placed my hand on a brooding\r\ncardinal, which merely fluttered from beneath it without showing further\r\nalarm; yet no wild bird has ever evinced toward myself any special\r\ndegree of friendship. When I was a lad I remember that a certain\r\ndecrepit old drake would follow me like a dog, and appeared to enjoy\r\nhimself in my society. I could not appreciate his friendship then, and\r\ngreatly fear that I was, at times, rather cruel to the old fellow.\r\n\r\nOne of the queerest friendships that ever came under my observation was\r\nthat which existed between a bantam cock and a pekin drake. The cock was\r\nthe most diminutive specimen of his kind that I ever saw, being hardly\r\nlarger than a quail, while the drake was almost as large as a full-grown\r\nfemale goose. These two birds, so widely dissimilar as to genus and\r\nspecies, were always together. If \"One Lung\" (the cock) took it into his\r\nhead to go into the garden and flew over the fence, \"Chung\" (the drake)\r\nwould solemnly waddle to a certain hole in the fence well known to\r\nhimself, and, by dint of much pushing with his strong, yellow feet,\r\nwould squeeze himself through, and rejoin his companion with many a\r\nguttural quack and flirt of his tail. If \"Chung\" desired to take a bath,\r\nhe would make for the brook, where \"One Lung\" would soon join him,\r\nalways remaining, however, on the bank, where he would strut about and\r\ncrow continuously. On one occasion, a chicken-hawk attacked the cock,\r\nwhich, though it defended itself valiantly, was in great danger of being\r\ndestroyed. The drake soon became aware of what was happening, and hurled\r\nhimself, with many a squawking quack, like a white avalanche against the\r\nhawk, and, with one quick blow of his horny, flat bill, laid this pirate\r\nof the air dead at his feet! He then examined the cock, with low-voiced\r\nexclamations issuing from his throat all the while. Then, finding him\r\nuninjured, he flapped his wings and quacked loud and long, as if in\r\nthankfulness. As for \"One Lung,\" he pecked the dead hawk several times,\r\nthen hopped up on its body and crowed as loud as he could, as if to say,\r\n\"Look-what-I-have-do-o-o-ne!\"\r\n\r\n\"One Lung\" was taken to a neighboring farm for breeding purposes by his\r\nowner, and \"Chung\" moped and appeared utterly inconsolable during his\r\nabsence. When the bantam was finally brought home, the drake recognized\r\nhim \"afar off\" and came hurrying to meet him with flapping wings and\r\nmuch vociferation. He caressed him with his bill, and appeared to make a\r\nclose examination of his person. These birds have always passed the\r\nnight close together, the bantam roosting among the branches of a low\r\nbush, while his faithful companion squatted on the ground at its root.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago I knew a hen which was devotedly attached to an old\r\nwhite horse. When the horse was confined to the stable, the hen was\r\nalways to be found in his stall, either in the manger, on the floor, or\r\nperched upon his back. This last position was a favorite one, and it was\r\nonly abandoned when the hen was in search of food. When the horse was\r\nout on pasture, the hen went with him and stayed close beside him until\r\nnightfall, when she always returned and roosted on one of the stall\r\npartitions.\r\n\r\nMany cow owners of my town are in the habit of turning out their cows in\r\nthe morning, allowing them to roam about in the search of grass during\r\nthe day. As there are many large open commons in the immediate\r\nneighborhood of town, the cows easily find an abundance of food. In my\r\nearly morning walks I repeatedly noticed a large red cow which was\r\nalways accompanied by a small black dog. When the cows came back into\r\ntown in the evening, many of them passed my house, and among the number\r\nwas the red cow and the dog in attendance. I became very much interested\r\nin the cow and dog, and, one evening, followed the former to her home. I\r\nasked her owner if he had trained the dog to follow the cow, whereupon\r\nhe disclaimed all knowledge of any dog, declaring that he had not\r\nallowed a dog on his premises for many years. The next morning I was at\r\nhis cow-house before the animal was turned out. When this occurred I\r\nfollowed her. A few blocks from her home, she was met by the dog, which\r\nbounded about her and showed his delight by wagging his tail. When she\r\nreturned home in the evening he accompanied her until he arrived at his\r\nown home (the place where he met her in the morning), when he left her\r\nand crawled through a hole in the fence. His owner declared that his dog\r\nhad been leaving home early in the morning and returning in the evening\r\nduring the entire spring and summer (it was then September), and that he\r\nhad often wondered where he stayed during the day. This queer friendship\r\ncontinued until November, when some miscreant put an end to it by\r\nshooting the dog. Neither the favored cow nor any of her companions\r\n(there were, sometimes, at least a hundred cows on the commons grazing\r\ntogether) appeared to pay the slightest attention to the dog or to\r\nnotice him in any way. The dog kept close to his friend, the red cow,\r\nduring the day, sometimes sitting gravely on his haunches and watching\r\nher eat, at other times frisking about her, as though asking for a romp.\r\nWhen she started to return home he followed close at her heels.\r\n\r\nAnother of my dog acquaintances struck up a friendship with a hog, and\r\nseemed to be highly pleased when he was allowed to play with his porcine\r\nfriend. What is more wonderful, the hog appeared to be just as fond of\r\nhis dog friend, and always greeted him with a series of delighted\r\ngrunts. If permitted, they would play together for hours at a time. The\r\ndog was the bitter enemy of other hogs, and would worry them at every\r\nopportunity.[40]\r\n\r\n  [40] These animals sometimes did not meet for months, yet they never\r\n  forgot each other, and their friendship continued for several years.\r\n\r\nI have had many friends among the lower animals, but have always gained\r\nand retained their good-will through their appetite. Some of these\r\ncreatures will be considered queer pets, for instance, grasshoppers,\r\nspiders, and crickets, yet they were very interesting and often showed\r\nmuch intelligence. The lower animals, with the single exception of the\r\ndog (I do not include the cat, for I doubt her friendship), rarely\r\naccept man as a companion and friend spontaneously. Their appetites or\r\nthe exigencies of their surroundings very frequently occasion them to\r\nact in a friendly manner towards man, simply in order to induce him to\r\nbefriend them. It is the rarest thing in the world for them to\r\nexperience disinterested friendship for him. As I have said elsewhere in\r\nthis paper, a few instances of disinterested and spontaneous affection\r\nof animals, other than dogs, for human beings are, however, on record,\r\nand I am happy in being able to record another.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 there was received at the Fair Grounds in St. Louis, Missouri, a\r\nconsignment of South American monkeys. Among the lot were several large\r\nindividuals of a species then unknown to me, and which remain unknown to\r\nme to this day. When I entered the monkey house I went at once to the\r\ncage of the newcomers. One of the creatures, after examining me very\r\ncarefully, uttered a peculiar cry, and then leaped to the bars and began\r\njabbering at a great rate. I told the keeper that I believed that the\r\nmonkey wished to make friends with me; that the tones of its voice were\r\ndecidedly pacific. He laughed at the idea, and declared that this same\r\nanimal had bitten him severely when he was removing it from the box in\r\nwhich it had been shipped to the cage in which it was then confined. I\r\nsaid nothing more, but, going behind the rail, inserted my hand between\r\nthe bars of the cage. The monkey immediately seized it with its paws,\r\nkissed it, and then licked it with its tongue. It then drew its head\r\ndown beside it, murmuring all the while in low tones. It showed great\r\npleasure when I scratched its head and body, and, in fact, seemed to\r\nregard me with the greatest affection. When the keeper, in his\r\nastonishment, drew near, the monkey bounded toward him, chattering and\r\nshowing every indication of great anger. This animal never forgot me,\r\nbut always recognized me the very moment I entered the monkey house.\r\n\r\nIn the same house there was a large dog-faced ape (chacma) named \"Joe,\"\r\nwhose friend and companion was a little white and black kitten. \"Joe\"\r\ncalled no living thing, except the cat, his friend; he had many\r\nacquaintances, but only one friend. He would tolerate me, and even\r\ninvented a name for me, so the keeper declared, yet his friendship never\r\ngot beyond tolerance. But he loved the cat, and the cat seemed to love\r\nhim--that is, as much as a cat could love. He could not bear to have her\r\ntaken from his cage; whenever this was done he would rage up and down\r\nhis den, coughing, growling, and yelling like a mad creature. When she\r\nwas restored to him he would seize her by the nape of the neck and carry\r\nher to the back of his cage, from which coign of vantage he would growl\r\nforth maledictions on the heads of his tormentors.\r\n\r\nIn order to test this monkey's memory, the cat was removed from the\r\ncage, and another cat was substituted. \"Joe\" at first appeared to be\r\nafraid of the new cat, and retired to the rear of his den. He would\r\navoid the cat, whenever she approached him, by moving about the cage.\r\nFinally, he became very angry, and seizing poor puss, he broke her back\r\nand then pulled her head from her body! This was done so quickly that\r\nthe tragedy was over before we could make a move to prevent it.\r\n\r\nAt the end of three months his pet was returned to him. The kitten had\r\ngrown considerably during this interval, yet \"Joe\" recognized her at\r\nonce, and welcomed her with many extravagant acts denoting joy and\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nAll of the higher animals, such as the dog, horse, cat, ox, elephant,\r\nmonkey, etc., possess this phase of memory.\r\n\r\n_Memory of Events_ (_Education_, _Happenings_, _etc._).--The memory of\r\nevents and their sequences is a faculty of the mind that is to be\r\nnoticed in animals very low in the scale of life. In fact, psychical\r\ndevelopment is based almost wholly upon this mental attribute. The vast\r\nmajority of what are now entirely instinctive habits were, in the\r\nbeginning, the results of sensual perceptions formulated and remembered\r\n(consciously and unconsciously), which gave rise to conscious ideation;\r\nthis conscious ideation, in turn, became instinct.\r\n\r\nThis part of my subject is treated at length in the chapter on Reason,\r\ntherefore I will only introduce here certain evidence of this phase of\r\nmemory as it is to be observed in the lower animals, especially in\r\ninsects. A wasp of the variety commonly called \"mud-dauber\" last summer\r\nbuilt her nest on the ceiling of my room in one corner. The windows of\r\nthis room remained open night and day during the hot summer months, so\r\nher nest was easy of access. One day, while the wasp was busy about her\r\nhome, I closed all the windows and awaited developments. At length she\r\nflew toward a window, against which she landed with a thump which for a\r\nmoment or two completely dazed her. The wasp soon discovered that she\r\nwas barred from the outer world by some transparent, translucent\r\nsubstance; she then proceeded on a voyage of discovery, flying around\r\nthe room and searching here and there and everywhere for an exit. She\r\nfinally found a small hole in a window casing which communicated with\r\nthe outside; through this she made her escape from the room. Upon\r\nopening the window I saw her examining the passage through which she had\r\ncome, going through it repeatedly. She finally flew away, but shortly\r\nreturned with a pellet of mud. Notwithstanding the fact that all the\r\nwindows were then open, the wasp went at once to the hole in the casing,\r\nthrough which she made her way into the room and thence to her nest on\r\nthe ceiling. She never again, so far as I was able to ascertain, made\r\nan exit or an entrance through the windows, but always made use of the\r\nhole in the casing. This little creature undoubtedly gave unmistakable\r\nevidences of ratiocination; she found that a transparent barrier had\r\nbeen placed in her way--a barrier so translucent and transparent that\r\nshe could not see it until she actually felt it. She therefore concluded\r\nthat she would never again risk injury by flying through the windows.\r\nWhat is most remarkable about this instance is that this insect derived\r\nher knowledge from a single experience, and at once profited thereby.\r\nThe wasp remembered the event--her experience with the window glass--and\r\navoided a like occurrence by going through the hole in the casing. Her\r\nexperience was a bit of education.\r\n\r\nThere are many people alive to-day, probably, who saw the trained fleas\r\nwhich were on exhibition in the large cities of the United States some\r\nthirty or forty years ago. These little creatures had been taught to\r\nperform military evolutions, to dance, to draw miniature carts, to feign\r\ndeath, etc., at the command or signal of their owner and trainer. The\r\nmere fact that they possessed memory enough to learn, retain, and\r\nremember their lessons is not proof positive of reason, but the fact of\r\ntheir having restrained their natural tendency and desire to escape,\r\nwhen they could so easily gratify such a desire or tendency, is a potent\r\nfactor in an argument for their possession of the ratiocinative\r\nfaculty. Their teacher explained that he \"brought them to reason\" by\r\nkeeping them at first in a glass vessel, where they jumped and bumped\r\ntheir heads to no purpose against the transparent walls of their prison.\r\nThus their vaulting ambition was held in check, and they learned to\r\nreason from cause and effect.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact that many of the higher animals can be taught to\r\ndo many things entirely foreign to their natures. This is brought about\r\nentirely through the faculty of remembering events. I am confident that\r\nmany of the lower animals, insects, crustaceans, reptiles, are likewise\r\nthe possessors of this faculty, and are capable of being taught. I,\r\nmyself, have succeeded in teaching a toad to hop over a stick at the\r\nword of command. Again, I taught two chameleons to take certain\r\npositions and to retain them at feeding time. These little creatures\r\nremembered their lesson, and at my whistle would \"line up\" on the\r\nparticular book that I had designated as their dining-table. We have\r\nseen that fleas are capable of being highly educated, hence it is\r\nreasonable to presume that other insects, specially and generically akin\r\nto the flea, likewise possess the faculty of remembering events. Of\r\ncourse, this faculty is necessarily more highly developed in some\r\nanimals than in others; it differs in degree of development, not in\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE EMOTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nCareful observation and investigation lead me to believe that, in many\r\nof the higher animals, all the fundamental emotions, such as love, hate,\r\nfear, anger, jealousy, etc., are present. Books on natural history\r\nfairly teem with data in support of this proposition. Such authorities\r\nas Romanes,[41] Darwin,[42] Semper[43] and Hartman[44] give instance\r\nafter instance in support of the dictum that the emotional nature of\r\nmany of the higher animals is highly developed.\r\n\r\n  [41] Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_.\r\n\r\n  [42] Darwin, _Descent of Man_.\r\n\r\n  [43] Semper, _Animal Life_.\r\n\r\n  [44] Hartmann, _Anthropoid Apes_.\r\n\r\nMan has been called the Laughing Animal, because, so it has been\r\nclaimed, he alone of all animals expresses emotion through the agency of\r\nthe smile or through laughter.\r\n\r\nThis is a grave mistake, for both the dog and the monkey, in certain\r\ninstances, have been known to express pleasure through the agency of the\r\nsmile. And, in the case of certain monkeys, the action of the facial\r\nmuscles was accompanied by cachinnatory sounds.\r\n\r\n\"Tom,\" a capuchin monkey of the St. Louis, Missouri, zooelogical garden\r\n(Fair Grounds), was quite a noted \"laugher,\" and his facial expressions\r\nas well as the sounds he uttered were so evidently laughter, pure and\r\nsimple, that the most casual observer was able to recognize them as\r\nsuch.\r\n\r\n\"Stranger,\" a half-bred spaniel belonging to my kennel, invariably\r\nexpressed pleasure with smiles. The action of the facial muscles, as\r\nwell as the facial expression engendered by this action, was widely\r\ndifferent from like phenomena when the dog showed his teeth in\r\nanger.[45]\r\n\r\n  [45] Compare Darwin, _Expression of the Emotions_, p. 120.\r\n\r\nYoung chimpanzees chuckle and smile when one they love returns to them\r\nafter an absence of some little time. Their eyes sparkle and grow\r\nbright, while very evident and easily recognized smiles flit over their\r\ncountenances.[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] Martin, _Natural History of Mammalia_, Vol. I. pp. 383, 410;\r\n  quoted also by Darwin, _loc. cit. ante_.\r\n\r\nYoung orang-utans likewise chuckle and grin when tickled, and, as\r\nWallace observes, give expression to unmistakable smiles. \"Dr.\r\nDuchenne--and I cannot quote a better authority--informs me that he kept\r\na tame monkey in his house for a year; and when he gave it, during\r\nmeal-times, some choice delicacy, he observed that the corners of its\r\nmouth were slightly raised; thus an expression of satisfaction,\r\npartaking of the nature of an incipient smile, and resembling that often\r\nseen on the face of man, could be plainly perceived in this animal.\"[47]\r\n\r\n  [47] Darwin, _loc. cit. ante_, p. 133.\r\n\r\nA dog belonging to Mr. Henry Barklay, of Paducah, Kentucky, not only\r\nsmiles when pleased, but also gives utterance to an unmistakable\r\nchuckle. When I first saw and heard this manifestation of delight, I\r\nthought that the animal had been taught the accomplishment; his master\r\nassured me, however, that such was not the case, that both the smile and\r\nthe chuckle were natural and inborn traits of the dog.\r\n\r\nI think it hardly necessary to give more data on this point; suffice it\r\nto say that it is a fact beyond dispute that certain monkeys and dogs\r\nare \"laughing animals,\" and that man is _not_ the only animal that\r\nexpresses emotion through the agency of the smile and laughter!\r\n\r\nOn one occasion during very hot weather, one of the combs in my\r\nbee-house became loosened at the top through melting of the wax. The\r\nweight on the comb dragged it down, and suddenly it broke from its\r\nsupports and sagged over against a neighboring comb. It was perfectly\r\napparent to me that if something were not done at once, the comb would\r\ncontinue to sag until it broke away from all its connections, and would\r\nthen be precipitated to the floor of the hive. The bees likewise\r\nrecognized this impending calamity, and clearly showed that they did by\r\nthe noise and tumult which arose among them as soon as they discovered\r\nthe precarious situation of the endangered comb.[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] Compare Huber, Vol. II. p. 280.\r\n\r\nThe loud buzzing which they immediately set up clearly indicated their\r\ndismay and consternation. It seemed to me very much like the noisy\r\nvociferation of conflicting counsels, which would undoubtedly arise\r\namong the people in some orderly town were they suddenly threatened by\r\nsome unforeseen and unheard-of catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe tumult among the bees continued for four or five minutes, when,\r\nsuddenly, order was evolved out of chaos, and they set to work to\r\nprevent the fall of the comb, showing almost, if not altogether, as much\r\nintelligence as human beings would evince under like circumstances.\r\n\r\nThey shored up the endangered comb by building a thick pillar of wax\r\nbetween it and a neighboring comb, thus effectually fixing it so that it\r\ncould sag no further. When this had been done, they re-affixed the top\r\nof the comb to the ceiling of the hive by a broad, thick bar of wax; the\r\npillar used in propping up the comb was afterwards removed and the wax\r\nused elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, these little creatures at first clearly evinced the\r\nemotions of fear, dismay, consternation, and grief; afterwards, they\r\njust as clearly showed fortitude and joy; for, after the supporting\r\npillar had been built, I saw the queen, surrounded by a crowd of\r\ncourtier-bees, on the comb near it, and am fully convinced that she had\r\nbeen brought out by her rejoicing subjects to view the results of their\r\nbrave struggle against an utterly unforeseen but now happily averted\r\ncalamity.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I witnessed the terrible grief of a community of\r\nbees at the death of their queen, which was seized with illness (a\r\nsudden and overwhelming diarrhoea, to which bees, at times, are very\r\nsubject) while making a progression through her domains, and fell to the\r\nfloor of the hive and died before she could be conveyed back to the\r\nroyal cell. I was, therefore, able to see the conduct of the bees during\r\nher illness and after her death.\r\n\r\nWhen she fell to the floor, the bees seemed to know at once that\r\nsomething out of the ordinary had happened. The sick queen was\r\nimmediately surrounded by a dense circle of her subjects, those next to\r\nher licking her with their tongues and endeavoring to raise her to her\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nWhen she died they were a little slow in recognizing the fact, but when\r\nthey did realize that she was dead those nearest the dead sovereign set\r\nup a loud buzzing. This was transmitted from circle to circle, from bee\r\nto bee, until the entire hive was in an uproar. The bees rushed to and\r\nfro bewailing their loss, and seemingly crazed by grief. All work was\r\nimmediately suspended, and even the young were abandoned and left, for\r\nthe time being, to shift for themselves. Those bees which returned to\r\nthe hive laden with honey did not put it into the cells but retained it\r\nin their honey-bags. In fact, the entire social economy of the hive was\r\ndisrupted and disarranged, and this confusion lasted for hours. After\r\nabout twenty-four hours of mourning for the dead queen the bees\r\nrecovered their equanimity, and began the work of rearing another queen\r\nfrom a worker larva.\r\n\r\nIn another chapter of this book (vid. Memory) I have related an\r\ninstance of complex ideation in a bird. I have reference to the sparrow\r\nwhose young was saved from a snake, and which remembered the lad who\r\ndestroyed its enemy. This bird undoubtedly showed gratitude. Another\r\ncorrespondent writes: \"Knowing your love for, and your interest in, all\r\nanimals, I think my experience with two house wrens this summer will\r\nentertain you. These birds selected for their home an old boot, which\r\nthey discovered on a bench in an outhouse. Here they built their nest,\r\nand, in the course of time, had the great pleasure of welcoming into the\r\nworld two interesting 'wrenlets.'\r\n\r\n\"One day, while feeding my pigeons, I noticed that the old wrens were\r\ngreatly disturbed by something or other. They kept flying about me,\r\nuttering sharp, complaining cries; they would now and then fly to the\r\nouthouse, and then back to me. At last it occurred to me that some\r\naccident might have befallen the young wrens, so I proceeded to\r\ninvestigate, and soon discovered the trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Some one, in rummaging about the room, had overturned the boot, which\r\nhad fallen in such manner that the top pressed against the wall, thus\r\neffectually barring the way to the nest. I righted the boot, thereby\r\nrestoring the children to their parents, much to the delight of all\r\nparties concerned. Ever since this episode the male wren has shown his\r\ngratitude in an unmistakable manner. He has followed me into the house\r\non several occasions; he has learned where I sit when engaged in sewing,\r\nand pays me short visits, flying though the window several times a day,\r\nand, wonderful to relate, after the young had learned to fly, he brought\r\nthem around to my window and evidently gave them to understand that I\r\nwas their saviour!\"\r\n\r\nThe higher animals, such as the horse, the ox, the dog, the monkey,\r\netc., show the emotions of anger, hate, fear, love, and grief so plainly\r\nthat \"he who runs may read.\" That these animals possess these emotions\r\nis a fact which hardly needs demonstration. They likewise have very\r\nretentive memories, sometimes treasuring up an injury for days, months,\r\nand years, until an opportunity arrives for them to \"get even,\" thus\r\nshowing that they are revengeful.\r\n\r\nThus, a dog of my acquaintance had been severely thrashed last winter\r\nby a larger dog. He bided his time, and, this summer, after his\r\nantagonist had been handicapped by having that atrocious invention, a\r\nmuzzle, affixed to his head, he fell upon him, \"tooth and toe-nail,\" and\r\nwould have killed him had he not been prevented.\r\n\r\nAgain, some years ago my attention was called to a large mandril by the\r\nkeeper of the monkey house in the St. Louis Zooelogical Garden, who\r\nremarked that \"That monkey will do me up some day. I had to thrash him\r\nseveral days ago, and ever since then he has had it in for me.\"\r\n\r\nNot ten minutes after the conversation, while I was in another part of\r\nthe building, I heard a yell from the keeper, and, on rushing to see\r\nwhat had happened, found that the man's thumb had been almost severed\r\nfrom his hand by the powerful teeth of the mandril. The keeper had been\r\nexplaining something to some visitors, standing with his back to the\r\nanimal, and with his hand resting on one of the bars of the cage. The\r\nbrute saw his opportunity, and, in the twinkling of an eye, seized it\r\nand inflicted a severe injury to the individual whom he regarded as his\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nDuring another visit to the above-mentioned monkey house, I accidentally\r\ninflicted an injury to a capuchin monkey, \"Tom\" by name, who was a great\r\nfriend of mine and who had been taken from his cage and given to me by\r\nthe keeper. After playing with him for a time, I had placed him on the\r\nfloor and had resumed my conversation with the keeper. Suddenly, \"Tom\"\r\ngave a loud squall and jumped into my lap, wringing one of his hands and\r\nmoaning piteously.\r\n\r\nHe held up his hand towards me, calling my attention to it with many a\r\ngrimace and cry; he even felt it with his other hand, carefully\r\nseparating the fingers and gently stroking them. On examination I\r\ndiscovered that the tips of two fingers were bruised and abraded; the\r\nlittle fellow had evidently had them caught in some way beneath the heel\r\nof my shoe. He quietly and patiently submitted while we dressed his\r\nwounded digits, but removed the bandages just as soon as he was returned\r\nto his cage, evidently having more faith in the curative qualities of\r\nhis own saliva than in the medicaments of man.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, the monkey clearly indicated that he had been hurt; he\r\npointed out the portion of his body where the injury was situated, and\r\nthen allowed his friend to \"doctor\" the injury, although he did not\r\nevince an abiding faith in that friend's skill. In contradistinction to\r\nthe mandril which evinced revenge, the capuchin showed that he was of a\r\nforgiving disposition, for, no sooner was he hurt, than he sought\r\nconsolation from the very person who inflicted the injury.\r\n\r\nAn English observer, Captain Johnson, writes as follows, when speaking\r\nof a monkey which he had shot: \"He instantly ran down to the lowest\r\nbranch of a tree, as if he were going to fly at me, stopped suddenly,\r\nand coolly put his paw to the part wounded, and held it out, covered\r\nwith blood, for me to see. I was so much hurt at the time that it has\r\nleft an impression never to be effaced, and I have never since fired a\r\ngun at any of the tribe.\"[49]\r\n\r\n  [49] Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, p. 475.\r\n\r\nAnother observer, Sir William Hoste, records a similar case. One of his\r\nofficers saw a monkey running along some rocks, holding her young one in\r\nher arms. He fired, and the animal fell. When he arrived at the place\r\nwhere she was lying, she clasped her young one closer, and pointed with\r\nher fingers to the hole in her breast made by the bullet. \"Dipping her\r\nfinger in the blood and holding it up, she seemed to reproach him with\r\nhaving been the cause of her pain, and also that of her young one, to\r\nwhich she frequently pointed.\"[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] Romanes, _op. cit._, p. 476.\r\n\r\nThese observations would seem to indicate that monkeys are capable of\r\nfeeling and of expressing sorrow and reproach. \"So intense is the grief\r\nof female monkeys for the loss of their young, that it invariably caused\r\nthe death of certain kinds kept under confinement by Brehm in North\r\nAmerica.\"[51]\r\n\r\n  [51] Darwin, _Descent of Man_, p. 70.\r\n\r\nBy the observant and analytical mind, the various psychical phenomena\r\nevinced by the lower animals are not regarded as being either wonderful\r\nor extraordinary. Man is a conceited, arrogant individual, and his\r\nplace in nature has done much toward fostering and enlarging this\r\nself-conceit and arrogance. Even in the time of Moses this\r\nself-glorification was _en evidence_. The genesis of the world, as\r\nrelated by this famous historiographer, geographer, naturalist,\r\ntheologian, and lawgiver, plainly shows this. At the present time,\r\nscience declares, emphatically, that man is but a mammal, whose brain\r\nhas undergone exceptional evolutionary development. He is but the\r\nyounger kinsman of other mammals whose evolutionary development has\r\nsought other channels; these, in turn, are but younger kin of yet older\r\nanimals, and so on backwards, to the beginning of life in bathybian\r\nprotoplasm. The resistless forces of evolution have placed him where he\r\nis, and no amount of self-adulation can hide the scientific fact that he\r\nis _not_ a special creation. All the creatures of the living world are\r\nkin, and that force which animated the first moneron, and which we call\r\nlife, has been transmitted from creature to creature until the present\r\nday, absolutely unchanged. There is no reason for believing that life\r\nwill ever be entirely extinguished, until conditions arise which will\r\nrender the presence of this force impossible.\r\n\r\nWhen we recognize the fact that intelligent ratiocination is but the\r\nproduct and the result of the psychical action of a certain substance\r\ncalled brain matter, and not the product and the result of the action of\r\nan essence or force unconnected with, or outside of, brain; and,\r\nfurthermore, when we know that these lower animals have receptive\r\nganglia analogous to those possessed by man, analogical deductions force\r\nus to the conclusion that these animals should possess mental emotions\r\nand functions similar to those of man.\r\n\r\nThe microscope shows that these animals have notochords, nervous\r\nsystems, and ganglia, or brains. With a one-sixteenth objective, and an\r\nachromatic light condenser, I have been able to differentiate the gray\r\nmatter in the brain of an ant, and even, on two occasions, to bring out\r\nthe cells and filaments of the cortex. Here in the brain of an ant, is\r\nan anatomical and physiological similarity to the brain of man:\r\ntherefore, it is reasonable to expect evidences of mental operations in\r\nthe ant akin to those of man.\r\n\r\nThat we do find these evidences in abundance can no longer be denied.\r\nSir John Lubbock chloroformed some _Lasius niger_ belonging to his\r\nformicary. The other ants brought their anaesthetized comrades out of the\r\nnest and carried them away; they thought that they were dead. He made\r\nsome other specimens of the same species intoxicated, and the ants\r\ncarefully bore their helpless companions back into the nest. The care\r\nevinced in helping their intoxicated friends to reach the safe shelter\r\nof their nest undoubtedly indicates a sense of sympathy toward the\r\nafflicted individuals.\r\n\r\nAnts frequently display sympathy for mutilated companions. Whether or\r\nnot this feeling is ethical or material is not and can not be\r\ndetermined; the fact remains, however, that sympathy is evinced. I\r\nmyself have observed it on many occasions. I removed the anterior pair\r\nof legs from a specimen of _Lasius flavus_, and placed her near the\r\nentrance to her nest. In a short time a companion came to her\r\nassistance, and, lifting her with her mandibles, carried her into the\r\nnest. A specimen of _F. fusca_, destitute of antennae, was attacked and\r\nseverely injured by an ant of another species. An ant of her own species\r\nsoon came by. \"She examined,\" says Lubbock, whom I quote, \"the poor\r\nsufferer carefully, then picked her up tenderly and carried her into the\r\nnest. It would have been difficult for any one who witnessed the scene\r\nto have denied to this ant the possession of human feelings.\"[52]\r\n\r\n  [52] Lubbock, _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_, p. 107.\r\n\r\nNot only do they display sympathy toward mutilated and helpless friends,\r\nbut also toward healthy individuals who may accidentally get into\r\ntrouble and need assistance. Belt, while watching a column of _Eciton\r\nhamata_, placed a stone upon one of them to secure her. The next ant in\r\nline, as soon as she discovered the condition of her friend, ran\r\nhurriedly backward and communicated the intelligence to the others.\r\n\"They rushed to the rescue; some bit at the stone and tried to move it,\r\nothers seized the prisoner by the legs and tugged with such force that I\r\nthought the legs would be pulled off; but they persevered until they got\r\nthe captive free. I next covered one up with a piece of clay, leaving\r\nonly the ends of its antennae projecting. It was soon discovered by its\r\nfellows, which set to work immediately, and by biting off pieces of the\r\nclay soon liberated it.\"\r\n\r\nAt another time he found a few of the same ants passing along at\r\nintervals. He buried one beneath a lump of clay, leaving only the head\r\nprotruding. A companion soon discovered her and tried to release her.\r\nFinding this to be impossible, she hurried away. Belt thought that she\r\nhad abandoned the unfortunate prisoner, but she had only gone for\r\nassistance, and soon returned accompanied by a dozen companions, which\r\nmade directly for the imprisoned ant and soon set her free. \"I do not\r\nsee how,\" says Belt in conclusion, \"this action could be instinctive. It\r\nwas sympathetic help, such as man only among the higher mammalia shows.\r\nThe excitement and ardor with which they carried on their unflagging\r\nexertions for the rescue of their comrade could not have been greater if\r\nthey had been human beings.\"[53] I have buried _Lasius flavus_ beneath\r\nsand, and in every instance, sooner or later, they have been dug out by\r\ntheir companions.\r\n\r\n  [53] Belt, _The Naturalist in Nicaragua_, p. 26; quoted also by\r\n  Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, p. 48.\r\n\r\nRev. Mr. White has noticed the same sympathetic help among _F.\r\nsanguinea_.[54] Lubbock noticed in one of his nests of _F. fusca_, Jan.\r\n23, 1881, an ant lying on her back and unable to move. She was unable\r\neven to feed herself. Several times he uncovered the part of the nest\r\nwhere she was. The other ants at once carried her to the covered part.\r\n\"On March 4,\" says he, \"the ants were all out of the nest, probably for\r\nfresh air, and had collected together in a corner of the box; they had\r\nnot, however, forgotten her, but had carried her with them. I took off\r\nthe glass lid of the box, and after a while they returned as usual to\r\nthe nest, taking her in again. On March 5th she was still alive, but on\r\nthe 15th, notwithstanding all their care, she was dead.\"[55]\r\n\r\n  [54] White, _Leisure Hour_, p. 390, 1880.\r\n\r\n  [55] Lubbock, _loc. cit. ante_, p. 107 _et seq._\r\n\r\nDr. Stimson Lambert of Owensboro, Kentucky, a careful and accurate\r\nobserver, informs me that he has frequently observed the large red ants\r\n(_F. rufa_) helping their mutilated or crippled companions.\r\n\r\nAnts exhibit another emotion that shows the high development of their\r\npsychical or emotional nature. In the tender watchfulness and care of\r\ntheir young they are surpassed by no living creature. As soon as the\r\nyoung ant bursts its pupa case, it is carefully assisted into the world\r\nby its foster-mothers. These foster-mothers clean it with their tongues,\r\ngently going over the entire surface of its body, and then feed it. The\r\nyoung ant is conducted by them throughout the whole nest, and shown all\r\nthe devious passageways and corridors. When it makes its first visit\r\ninto the outside world, it is always accompanied by several chaperons.\r\nThis parental love, if I may use the expression, is even extended to the\r\nunhatched eggs. If an ants' nest is disturbed by a stroke of a spade or\r\nhoe, the little inhabitants will at once begin to remove eggs, pupae, and\r\nyoung to a place of safety.\r\n\r\nThis parental love is even evinced by insects who never see their\r\noffspring. The butterfly uses the utmost care in selecting a suitable\r\nleaf on which to deposit her eggs. She selects one that will be\r\nnourishing food for the larvae when hatched out, and, after carefully\r\nobserving whether it is preoccupied by the eggs of some other butterfly\r\n(in which case she abandons it), she proceeds to deposit her eggs.\r\n\"Having fulfilled this duty, from which no obstacle short of absolute\r\nimpossibility, no danger however threatening, can divert her, the\r\naffectionate mother dies.\"[56]\r\n\r\n  [56] Kirby and Spence, _Entomology_, p. 228.\r\n\r\nThe gadfly uses a like forethought in selecting a place for her eggs.\r\nThe larvae of the gadfly (_OEstrus equi_) are developed in the stomach\r\nof the horse, so the provident mother attaches the eggs to the hairs of\r\nthe foreleg between the knee and the shoulder, a place the horse is\r\nalmost certain to lick with his tongue and, in this manner, convey the\r\neggs to his stomach, where they are hatched out. The breeding place of\r\ncertain of the ichneumons is the body of a caterpillar. The ichneumon\r\nmay be seen busily searching the bushes for her victim. When she finds\r\nit, she inserts her ovipositor into its body and lays her egg. If some\r\nother ichneumon has preceded her, she recognizes the fact at once, and\r\nwill not deposit her egg, but will go in search of another grub. When\r\nthe egg is hatched, the larva feeds on the body of its host, carefully\r\navoiding the vital organs. The caterpillar retains just enough vitality\r\nto assume the pupa state, and then dies. The chrysalis discloses, not a\r\nbutterfly, but an ichneumon.\r\n\r\nThe mason wasp (_Epipone spinipes_) builds its cells and lays its eggs,\r\none in each cell. It then hunts and procures spiders, which it deposits\r\nin the cells and then seals the openings. These spiders are not killed\r\noutright, but are partially paralyzed by the sting of the wasp. The\r\ninsect thus secures for her young a supply of fresh food. This wasp not\r\nonly knows the difference between the eggs that will produce female\r\nyoung, but she also makes this knowledge useful. She always supplies the\r\nfemales with more spiders than she does the males. The females are\r\nlarger and require more food, hence the discrimination. All of this care\r\nand forethought is expended on young which the mother will never see.\r\nHuman love cannot give greater evidences of complete unselfishness.\r\n\r\nI once removed a ball of eggs from the web of a spider. The mother clung\r\ntenaciously to her treasure, and, when I tried to remove her with a pair\r\nof forceps, she bit fiercely at the steel blades of the instrument. In\r\nher great love for her offspring she lost all sense of fear. Time and\r\nagain I removed her several inches from the eggs; she would run about in\r\na distracted way, for all the world like a mother who had lost her baby,\r\nuntil she found the ball of eggs. She would then seize it and attempt to\r\nremove it to a place of safety. The naturalist, Bonnet, put a spider and\r\nher bag of eggs in the pit of an ant-lion. The myrmeleon seized the\r\negg-bag and tore it away from the spider. Bonnet forced the spider out\r\nof the pit, but she returned and chose to be dragged in and buried alive\r\nrather than leave her eggs.[57]\r\n\r\n  [57] Bonnet, _OEuvres_; quoted also by Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_,\r\n  p. 205.\r\n\r\nEarwigs lay their eggs, and then incubate them after the manner of the\r\nhen. When the young are hatched out, the proud mother leads forth the\r\nbrood and shows unmistakable pride and affection in her children. On one\r\noccasion, when a storm was coming up, I saw an earwig marshal her troop\r\nof young ones, and lead them to a place of safety beneath the bark of a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nM. Geer scattered the eggs of an earwig over the bottom of a box: \"The\r\nearwig carried them, however, one by one, into a certain part of the\r\nbox, and then remained constantly sitting upon the heap without ever\r\nquitting it for a moment until the eggs were hatched.\"[58] This, I take\r\nit, is at least an instance of love of offspring, even if it is not a\r\nhigher emotion. From the earwig's habit of watching over her young I am\r\ninclined to believe that this insect possesses true mother-love.\r\n\r\n  [58] Romanes, _loc. cit. ante_, p. 229; quoted also by Bingley, _loc.\r\n  cit._, Vol. III. pp. 150, 151.\r\n\r\nMany of the lower animals give unmistakable evidences of the possession\r\nby them of the emotions of anger and fear. Ants, centipedes, tarantulas,\r\nweevils, etc., as well as many of the crustacea will give battle on the\r\nslightest provocation, clearly showing by their actions that anger and\r\nhate are their incentives. When alarmed, their actions indicate very\r\nplainly that the emotion of fear has seized them.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter I hope to show that many of the lower animals\r\npossess one or more of the finer emotions, which I have thought best to\r\ngroup under the head of AEstheticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAESTHETICISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The man that hath not music in himself, nor is not moved with concord\r\nof sweet sounds, is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils.\" The above\r\nquotation is the thought of one of the most acute, profound, and\r\naccurate psychologists that ever lived. That which he observed to be\r\ntrue among men, strangely enough, a long and systematic course of\r\nobservation leads me to believe to be equally true among the lower\r\nanimals; for wherever it can be observed that animals evince an\r\nappreciation for musical sounds, or show discrimination in their\r\nperception of harmonious tonal vibrations, such animals, with a single\r\nexception--the spider--will be found to be of kind disposition, and not\r\ngiven to \"treasons, stratagems, and spoils\" other than those required by\r\ntheir struggle for existence. So true is this rule, that the single\r\nexception--the spider--proves the verity of the deduction or conclusion.\r\nFor, like many men, the spider's love for the beautiful, not only in\r\nmusic but in decorative effects as well, is intimately associated with\r\nmurder-lust; it kills for the love of killing. Many examples of the\r\nassociation of great cruelty and profound love for the beautiful in\r\nnature and the arts might be given; it is necessary for my purpose,\r\nhowever, to give but two--Nero and Catherine de' Medici.\r\n\r\nThat spiders appreciate musical sounds, and that they can differentiate\r\nbetween those sounds that are pleasing and those that are disagreeable\r\nto them, I have not a scintilla of doubt. The following facts bearing on\r\nthis point came under my own observation or were told me by people in\r\nwhose veracity I believe implicitly, or are vouched for by scientists of\r\nworld-wide fame.\r\n\r\nDuring one entire summer until late in autumn, a large, black hunting\r\nspider (_Lycosa_) dwelt in my piano. When I played _andante_ movements\r\nsoftly, she would come out on the music rack and seem to listen\r\nintently. Her palpi would vibrate with almost inconceivable rapidity,\r\nwhile every now and then she would lift her anterior pair of legs and\r\nwave them to and fro, and up and down. Just as soon, however, as I\r\ncommenced a march or galop, she would take to her heels and flee away to\r\nher den somewhere in the interior of the piano, where she would sulk\r\nuntil I enticed her forth with _Traeumerei_ or Handel's _Largo_.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, while standing beside an organist who was improvising\r\non the swell organ with _viol d'amour_ stop drawn, a spider let herself\r\ndown from the ceiling of the church and hung suspended immediately above\r\nhis hands. He coupled on to great organ and commenced one of Guilmant's\r\nresonant _bravura_ marches; immediately the spider turned and rapidly\r\nclimbed her silken thread to her web high up among the timbers of the\r\nceiling. The organist informed me that he had noticed, time and again,\r\nthat spiders were affected by music. Several days afterwards I went to\r\nthe church for the special purpose of experiment; I seated myself at the\r\norgan and commenced to improvise on the swell organ with _flute_, _viol\r\nd'amour_, and _tremulant_ stops out. In a few moments the spider let\r\nherself down from the ceiling and hung suspended before my eyes. So\r\nclose was she that I could see her palpi vibrating rapidly and\r\ncontinuously. I suddenly dropped to great organ and burst into a loud,\r\nquick galop; the spider at once turned and ascended towards the ceiling\r\nwith the utmost rapidity. Again and again I enticed her from her home in\r\nthe ceiling, or sent her scurrying back, by playing slow _piano_ or\r\nquick _forte_ compositions. She clearly and conclusively indicated that\r\nloud, quick music was disagreeable to her. Professor C. Reclain of\r\nLeipsic, once, during a concert, saw a spider descend from one of the\r\nchandeliers and hang suspended above the orchestra during a violin solo;\r\nas soon, however, as the full orchestra joined in, it quickly ascended\r\nto its web.[59] This fact of musical discrimination in a creature so\r\nlow in the scale of animal life is truly wonderful; it indicates that\r\nthese lowly creatures have arrived at a degree of aestheticism that is\r\nvery high indeed.\r\n\r\n  [59] Reclain, _Body and Mind_, p. 275; quoted by Romanes, _Animal\r\n  Intelligence_, pp. 205, 206; compare Rabigot, Simonius, and Von\r\n  Hartmann.\r\n\r\nSpiders are decorative artists of no little ability. I saw one which\r\nspun a web, beautifully adorned it with a broad, silken pathway, and\r\nthen used it as a pleasure resort; I also saw a spider which\r\nintentionally beautified its web by affixing to it hundreds of minute\r\nflakes of logwood dye;[60] thus we see that the aestheticism of spiders\r\nis not confined to the love of music, but extends to other fields. In\r\npassing, I may state that once, while confined to my room for a long\r\ntime by sickness, I became intimately acquainted with a wolf-spider\r\nwhich seemed to take an aesthetic delight in her toilet. This lycosid\r\nbecame so very tame that she would crawl upon my finger and allow\r\nherself to be brought close to my eyes, so that I could observe her deft\r\nand skilful movements while beautifying her person. She learned to know\r\nme personally, rapidly running away and hiding herself when visitors\r\nentered my chamber, but never showing fear when I alone was in the room.\r\nThis spider also showed an appreciation for certain musical sounds (the\r\ninstrument used was the paper and comb mouth-organ of childhood); low,\r\nsoft music would always entice her from her den beneath the table-lid,\r\nwhile loud, quick sounds seemed to frighten and disgust her.\r\n\r\n  [60] Mr. Willard Bates, a druggist of Owensboro, Kentucky, in whose\r\n  store this instance of decorative aestheticism occurred, called my\r\n  attention to the insect, which was busily engaged in beautifying her\r\n  web.\r\n\r\nAmong animal music-lovers this chapter does not embrace those natural\r\nmusicians, the crickets, grasshoppers, locusts, frogs, and birds, whose\r\nlove-songs form such a large part of the aesthetic in nature; yet the\r\ninstance I am about to relate cannot be omitted, for it clearly\r\nindicates a love for musical sounds other than those produced by the\r\ncreature itself or its mates.\r\n\r\nA gentleman,[61] formerly living in the country, but now an\r\nattorney-at-law and residing in the town in which I live, told me that,\r\non one occasion, he succeeded in raising two quails from eggs placed\r\nbeneath a brooding barnyard fowl. These birds grew to maturity, and,\r\nwhat is rare indeed, became so exceedingly tame that they ran about the\r\nhouse and yard with the utmost freedom, showing not the slightest fear,\r\nand, seemingly, taking the greatest pleasure in the caresses bestowed\r\nupon them by the children of the household. This gentleman comes of a\r\nmusical family, and, on pleasant summer nights, he and his sisters and\r\nbrothers were in the habit of going to the stiles some distance away\r\nfrom the house and there singing and playing on the guitar and violin\r\nfor several hours. The quails roosted on a dresser in the kitchen, but,\r\nas soon as the music began, they left their roost and flew to the stiles\r\nno matter how late in the night it might be, and there they would stay,\r\nperched on the shoulders of the musicians, until the concert was over;\r\nthey would then go back to roost. They seemed to be passionately fond of\r\nthe singing voice, and would seek out a singer wherever he or she might\r\nbe, whenever they heard the sound of singing. In _timbre_ the human\r\nfemale voice is more nearly akin to that of the quail than to that of\r\nany other animal. When a lad, \"before my voice changed,\" I could call up\r\nthese birds at will by giving their various calls; I did not whistle the\r\nsongs; I _sang_ them. The peculiar quality of the female voice referred\r\nto above may be considered by some to have been the cause that\r\ninfluenced these birds; yet my informant distinctly states that _the\r\nvoice of an adult male equally attracted them_.\r\n\r\n  [61] Martin Yewell, Esq., Owensboro, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThe opening movement of Chopin's _Marche Funebre_ affects me very\r\ndisagreeably. The music is, to me, absolutely repugnant. The beautiful\r\nmelody in the second movement is, however, to me exceedingly agreeable\r\nand affords me intense pleasure and gratification. The lower animals are\r\nlikewise agreeably or disagreeably affected by certain musical sounds.\r\nClose observation has taught me the fact that certain musical keys are\r\nmore agreeable to dogs than others. If a composition in a certain key,\r\nthe fundamental note of which is agreeable to a dog, be played, he will\r\neither listen quietly and intently to the sounds, or will, sometimes,\r\nutter low and not unmusical howls in accord or \"in tune\" with the\r\nfundamental note. If the music be in a key not pleasing to him, he will\r\neither show absolute indifference, or will express his dissatisfaction\r\nwith discordant yelps not in accord with the fundamental note of the\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nThe bell of a certain church in my town sounds G. A collie, which lives\r\nnext door to the church, when the bell is rung, never fails to express his\r\ndelight in the sound. He listens intently while the bell is ringing,\r\noccasionally giving utterance to low howls, the notes being either B-flat,\r\nE-flat, or some other note in accord with G. This dog visits a house next\r\ndoor to another church, the bell of which sounds F. He never shows the\r\nslightest interest when this bell is rung. When I play compositions in\r\nF-sharp, an English fox-terrier of mine will lie on the floor and listen\r\nfor an hour at a time. If I change to the key of E-flat, B-flat, or G, he\r\nwill soon leave the room.\r\n\r\nA question naturally obtrudes itself here in the matter of the dog which\r\nbarks in accord with the church-bell. Does he do this knowingly\r\n(consciously), or is it simply an accident? I believe the former, and\r\nconsider it the result of an acquired psychical habitude.\r\n\r\nThat the dog is conscious (self-conscious) that his voice is in accord\r\nwith the bell, I will not venture to assert, for, knowledge on this\r\npoint, I take it, is beyond the power of man to acquire. I mean by the\r\nword, \"knowingly,\" when I say that the dog knowingly pitches his voice\r\nin accord with the bell, not that he has any knowledge whatever of\r\nharmony, such as an educated musician possesses, or such even as the\r\ninherited experiences of a thousand years of music-loving ancestors\r\nwould naturally impress upon the mind of a civilized European of to-day,\r\nbut that he has an acquired imitative faculty (a faculty possessed by\r\nsome of the negroes of Central Africa as well as by many other savage\r\nraces), of attuning his voice to sounds which are pleasing to his ears.\r\nIn support of this proposition I instance the fact of the dog's acquired\r\nhabit of barking, which has been developed since his domestication. In\r\nhis wild state the dog _never_ barks.\r\n\r\nMan himself has done much toward arousing and cultivating the imitative\r\nfaculty in the dog (which, in the beginning, impelled this highly\r\ndeveloped animal to _answer_ his master, thus originating the first\r\nvocables--barking--in the canine language), by conversing with him. In\r\nall probability, it is only an \"anatomical barrier and a psychical\r\naccident\" at best, which prevent the dog from addressing his master\r\nthrough the agency of speech itself!\r\n\r\nThe dog's voice is exceedingly pleasing to himself, and, most\r\nfrequently, when \"baying the moon,\" he is listening to his own singing,\r\n_not_ (as is generally supposed) as it pours forth from his throat, but\r\nin a more pleasing manner, as it is breathed back to his listening ears\r\nfrom the airy lips of Echo!\r\n\r\nThat dogs have discovered that pleasing phenomenon, the echo, I do not\r\nquestion for a single instant. If a dog which is in the habit of \"baying\r\nthe moon\" be watched, it will be observed that he invariably selects the\r\nsame spot or spots for his nocturnal concerts. If you happen to be\r\nstanding in the neighborhood, you will also notice that there is always\r\nan echo, more or less distinct, of his barking; and, if you will observe\r\nclosely, you will see that the dog listens for this echo, and that he\r\nwill not resume his song until it (the echo) has entirely ceased. That\r\nthis is the true explanation of \"baying the moon\" (where there is not\r\nanother dog in the distance whose clamorous barkings have aroused a like\r\nperformance on the part of the animal under observation), the following\r\ninstance, coming under my own observation, would seem to indicate.\r\n\r\nI had frequently noticed that a spaniel crept under a honeysuckle bush\r\nin my front yard whenever he gave one of his serenades. Time and again I\r\ntried to hear the echo, but in vain, and an almost verified fact seemed\r\nin danger of total annihilation. Finally, it occurred to me to\r\ndispossess the dog and take his place beneath the bush. I called him out\r\nand succeeded with much difficulty in getting beneath the bush, from\r\nwhence I, imitating his voice, sent several howling barks. My theory was\r\nno longer merely theory, but was, instead, a verified fact, for, sharp,\r\nclear, and distinct, the echoes of my voice came back from some\r\nbuildings an eighth of a mile away! Some peculiar acoustic environment\r\nmade it impossible to get the echo at any place, as far as I could\r\ndiscover, other than beneath the bush.[62]\r\n\r\n  [62] These observations are original, and, while I am fully convinced\r\n  of their truth, I would yet like to have them substantiated by other\r\n  observers. This habit indicates a high degree of aesthetic feeling in\r\n  the dog.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that the susceptibility of rats and mice to the\r\ninfluence of musical sounds has been known for ages. The legend of the\r\nPied Piper of Hamelin is by no means recent, nor is it confined to\r\nEuropean peoples alone; in one form or another it exists among Asiatic,\r\nIndian, and Indo-Malayan races. In all the legends, the rats or mice are\r\ndrawn together by sounds emanating from some kind of musical instrument.\r\n\r\nA celebrated violinist told me that, at one period of his life, he lived\r\nin a house that fairly swarmed with rats. He noticed that these\r\ncreatures were peculiarly susceptible to minor chords, or to\r\ncompositions played in minors, and that quick, lively music would bring\r\nthem forth from their lurking-places in great numbers. A few abrupt,\r\ndissonant discords would, invariably, send them scurrying to their\r\nholes.\r\n\r\nAnother violinist informs me that several mice living in his room are\r\ninfluenced by the music of his violin; when he plays an _andante_\r\nmovement very softly, they appear to listen intently and to enjoy the\r\nmusic; but when he plays an _allegro_ in quick time and loud, they\r\nquickly run away. The organist of the First Presbyterian Church of\r\nOwensboro, Kentucky,[63] tells me that when he lived in Cuba, New York,\r\na mouse dwelt beneath a bookcase in his room, and that he often\r\nperformed the following experiment: Seating himself at the piano, he\r\nwould begin improvising softly. In a few moments the mouse would come\r\nfrom beneath the bookcase, approach the centre of the room, and,\r\nstanding on its hind feet, would listen intently to the music. A loud\r\nchord on the piano would send it scampering away to its home. He would\r\nthen resume his _pianissimo_ improvisation, and the mouse would soon\r\nreturn to its former station near the centre of the room, only to vanish\r\nagain as soon as the loud chords were struck.\r\n\r\n  [63] Professor L. J. Quigley.\r\n\r\nA violinist of Louisville, Kentucky, Mr. Karl Benedik, told me, on one\r\noccasion, that he had repeatedly noticed that several mice, which lived\r\nin his room, were influenced by the music of his violin. When he played\r\nan _andante_ movement _pianissimo_, they would appear to listen with\r\npleasure; but when he played an _allegro_ in quick _tempo_ and _forte_,\r\nthey immediately ran away.\r\n\r\nMice not only enjoy the music of others, but sometimes make music\r\nthemselves. My father enjoyed nightly concerts or serenades, for a long\r\ntime, from some \"singing mice\" in his library. I was fortunate enough to\r\nhear this novel concert on one occasion. The mice, two in number, came\r\nout from beneath the casing of the fireplace. They took places on the\r\nhearth, several feet distant from one another, and first one, and then\r\nthe other, sang. Their songs were low and musical, not unlike the song\r\nof the canary, though there were no cadenzas or _fioritura_ passages.\r\nThey seemed to use six notes, these notes being repeated in melodious\r\nsequences. I noticed, several times, a run of four notes in ascending\r\nscale. On another occasion, in my bedroom, I heard a mouse sing his\r\npleasing little song over and over again.\r\n\r\nMiss Ada Sterling, editor of _Fashions_, writes me as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"... Anent your paper ... I have had some curious experiences of a\r\nsimilar nature; one was in an uncarpeted room, the house being deserted\r\nat that time. I stood still, planning certain things and humming softly\r\nto myself. Presently, a shadowy something caught my eye, and I\r\ndiscovered a little mouse, very young evidently, then another and\r\nanother, until four were near. I did not attribute their tameness to\r\nmusic, and in surprise turned to see if there were others about.\r\nInstantly they scampered off, my action having frightened them.\r\n\r\n\"When I finally arrived at the conclusion that music had attracted them,\r\nI sat down and began to hum, this time with an open sound instead of a\r\nclosed tone, and in a second the little creatures were out again,\r\nstanding perfectly still, as if the sound gave them delight. Gradually I\r\nswelled the tone, and yet they were undisturbed until I became too bold\r\nand gave a clear, sharp, full sound, and this at once frightened them.\r\n\r\n\"_I experimented in this way for more than a month, never missing my\r\naudience once_, and by this time the little creatures, grown so fat and\r\nbold as to cause serious damage, were ruthlessly caught and killed.\r\n\r\n\"I heard Kate Field, about four years ago, when, as the guest of Mr.\r\nStedman, she told several interesting stories, relate an experience of\r\nher own, wherein, one night early in her life, she had leaned against\r\nthe walls of the Campanile, gray and phantom-like in the moonlight, and,\r\nsinging softly to herself, was surprised at discovering several little\r\nlizards lying about on the stones, their heads held alertly in the air\r\nas if entranced by the sound of her voice. She, too, experimented with\r\nthe varying sounds, and from time to time, and evidently looked back\r\nupon the experiment as one of rare interest to herself.\"\r\n\r\nTree lizards will listen completely entranced to the music of a good\r\nwhistler, and will allow themselves to be captured while thus\r\ninthralled. Some lizards are fairly good musicians themselves, notably\r\nthe tree lizards of the East Tennessee mountains. I have repeatedly\r\nheard them singing on the slopes of Chilhowie and adjacent peaks.\r\n\r\nBurroughs writes very entertainingly of a singing lizard, or, rather,\r\nsalamander: \"... Approach never so cautiously the spot from which the\r\nsound proceeds and it instantly ceases, and you may watch for an hour\r\nwithout hearing it again. 'Is it a frog,' I said--'the small tree-frog,\r\nthe piper of the marshes--repeating his spring note but little changed\r\namid the trees?' Doubtless it is, but I must see him in the very act. So\r\nI watched and waited, but to no purpose, till one day, while bee-hunting\r\nin the woods, I heard the sound proceeding from the leaves at my feet.\r\nKeeping entirely quiet, the little musician presently emerged, and\r\nlifting himself up on a small stick, his throat palpitated, and the\r\nplaintive note again came forth. 'The queerest frog that ever I saw,'\r\nsaid a youth who accompanied me and whom I had enlisted to help solve\r\nthe mystery. No, it was no frog or toad at all, but the small red\r\nsalamander commonly called lizard.\"[64]\r\n\r\n  [64] Gibson, _Sharp Eyes_, pp. 105, 106; quotation.\r\n\r\nThe sound of the piccolo is very pleasing to these little creatures, and\r\nI have frequently collected about me as many as ten or a dozen by\r\nsounding this instrument in the still depths of a wood which I knew\r\nthese salamanders frequented.\r\n\r\nCertain snakes are very susceptible to the charm of harmonious tonal\r\nvibration; witness the performance of the Hindu snake charmer, who,\r\nwhile handling that deadly poisonous creature, the cobra-de-capello,\r\nplays continuously on flageolets, fifes, or other musical\r\ninstruments.[65] I, myself, have often held tree lizards completely\r\nentranced until grasped in my hand, by whistling shrilly and\r\ncontinuously.\r\n\r\n  [65] It has been claimed by some that the cobra is not influenced by\r\n  the music, but by movements of the Hindu performer, who dances,\r\n  salaams, etc., continually while giving exhibitions. Very recently,\r\n  however, Momsen has proven the contrary by actual experiment.\r\n\r\nI remember, on one occasion, when I was quite young, that a large black\r\nsnake crawled through a ventilating hole in the wall of the \"quarters\"\r\nor row of brick cottages occupied by the negroes, and took shelter\r\nbeneath the floor. It was seen by myself and some of my dusky playmates,\r\nwho immediately carried the tidings to the negro gardener. He called one\r\nof the hands from the field, and, after placing him with a loaded\r\nshotgun at one side of the hole in the wall, took his station just\r\nbehind him and commenced to play on his fiddle. In a few moments the\r\nsnake came out, and was killed by the discharge of the gun in the hands\r\nof the other negro. I have been informed, time and again, by negroes\r\nthat they could charm snakes from their holes with music, but the\r\ninstance related above is the only one of the snake being led to its\r\ndeath by the bewitching power of musical sounds that has ever come under\r\nmy immediate personal observation.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing the subject of the influence of music on animals, I\r\nwish to call attention to the fact that Romanes declares that pigeons\r\nand parrots evince an aesthetic enjoyment of musical sounds.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover,\" writes he, \"the pleasure which birds manifest in musical\r\nsounds is not always restricted to the sounds which they themselves\r\nproduce.\"\r\n\r\nBingley quotes John Lockman, the celebrated composer, who declares that\r\nhe once saw a pigeon which could distinguish a particular air. Lockman\r\nwas visiting a Mr. Lee in Cheshire, whose daughter was a fine pianist,\r\n\"and whenever she played the air of _Speri si_ from Handel's opera of\r\n'Admetus,' a pigeon would descend from an adjacent dovecot to the window\r\nof the room where she sat, 'and listen to the air apparently with the\r\nmost pleasing emotions,' always returning to the dovecot immediately the\r\nair was finished. But it was only this one air that would induce the\r\nbird to behave in this way.\"[66]\r\n\r\n  [66] Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, p. 282; quoted by Bingley,\r\n  _Animal Biography_, Vol. II. p. 220.\r\n\r\nA correspondent writes me that he has a cock which is passionately fond\r\nof the sound of the violin. This bird always flies to the window of the\r\nmusic-room as soon as he hears the sound of the violin, where he will\r\nquietly remain perched as long as the music continues. As soon as the\r\nmusic ceases, he flies down from the window.\r\n\r\nHorses very frequently show an appreciation for musical sounds,\r\nespecially when they are produced by a band of brasses.\r\n\r\nAmusement and pastime are, unquestionably, aesthetic psychical\r\ncharacteristics, hence, when we see evidences of these mental\r\noperations, we must acknowledge the presence of aestheticism in the\r\nanimals in which they are to be noticed.\r\n\r\nI propose to show that animals low in the scale of life--animals so low\r\nand so minute that it takes a very high-power lens to make them visible,\r\nhave their pastimes and amusements. Also, that many insects and even the\r\nslothful snail are not so busily engaged in the struggle for existence\r\nthat they cannot spare a few moments for play. In our researches in this\r\nfield of animal intelligence we must not attribute the peculiar actions\r\nof the males in many species of animals when courting the females, to\r\nsimple pastime, for they are the outward manifestations of sexual\r\ndesire, and are not examples of psychical amusement. I have seen, in\r\nactinophorous rhizopods, certain actions, unconnected with sexual desire\r\nor the gratification of appetite, which lead me to believe that these\r\nminute microscopic organisms have their pastimes and moments of simple\r\namusement. On several occasions while observing these creatures, I have\r\nseen them chasing one another around and around their miniature sea.\r\nThey seemed to be engaged in a game of tag. This actinophrys is not very\r\nagile, but when excited by its play, it seems to be an entirely\r\ndifferent creature, so lively does it become. These actions were not\r\nthose of strife, for first one and then another would act the pursuer\r\nand the pursued. There were, generally, four or five actinophryans in\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\nOne of the rotifers frequently acts as if engaged in play. On several\r\noccasions I have observed them perform a kind of dance, a _pas seul_,\r\nfor each rotifer would be alone by itself. Their motions were up and\r\ndown as if exercising with an invisible skipping-rope. They would keep\r\nup this play for several minutes and then resume feeding or quietly\r\nremain at rest. This rotifer goes through another performance which I\r\nalso believe to be simply a pastime. Its tail is armed with a double\r\nhook or forceps. It attaches itself to a piece of alga or other\r\nsubstance by this forceps, and then moves its body up and down in the\r\nwater for several minutes at a time.\r\n\r\nThe snail (_H. pomatia_) likewise has its moments of relaxation and\r\namusement. The following instance of play may be considered to be\r\ngallantry by some, but I do not believe that I am mistaken, however,\r\nwhen I consider it an example of animal pastime. Two snails approached\r\neach other, and, when immediately opposite, began slowly to wave their\r\nheads from side to side. They then bowed several times in courtly\r\nsalutation. This performance they kept up for quite a while and then\r\nmoved away in different directions. At no time did they come in contact,\r\nand careful observation failed to reveal any excitement in the\r\ngenitalia. I have witnessed the embraces of snails, and the performance\r\ndescribed above does not resemble, in the slightest degree, the\r\nmanoeuvres executed at such times by mating individuals.\r\n\r\nSwarms of Diptera may be seen on any bright day dancing in the sunlight.\r\nNaturalists have heretofore considered this swarming to be a mating of\r\nthe two sexes. This is not the case, however, in many instances. On\r\nnumerous occasions, and at different seasons of the year, I have\r\ncaptured dozens of these insects in my net and have examined them\r\nmicroscopically. I found them all to be unimpregnated females; I have\r\nnever yet discovered a male among them. In some of the Diptera the males\r\nemerge from the pupa state after the females; I therefore believe that\r\nthe females await the presence of the males, and, while waiting, pass\r\nthe time away in aerial gambols.\r\n\r\nForel, Lubbock, Kirby, Spence, and other naturalists have declared that\r\nants, on certain occasions, indulge in pastimes and amusements. Huber\r\nsays that he saw a colony of _pratensis_, one fine day, \"assembled on\r\nthe surface of their nest, and behaving in a way that he could only\r\nexplain as simulating festival sports or other games.\"[67] On the 27th\r\nof September last, the males and females of a colony of _Lasius flavus_\r\nemerged from their nest; I saw these young kings and queens congregate\r\nabout the entrance of the nest and engage in playful antics until driven\r\naway by the workers. The workers would nip their legs with their\r\nmandibles until the royal offspring were forced to fly in order to\r\nescape being bitten. The inciting cause of these movements may have been\r\nsexual in character, but I hardly think so.\r\n\r\n  [67] Buechner, _Geistesleben der Thiere_, p. 163; quoted also by\r\n  Romanes, _loc. cit. ante_, pp. 87, 88.\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of July, 1894, I saw several _Lasius niger_ come out of\r\ntheir nest accompanied by a minute beetle (_Claviger foveolatus_); the\r\nants caressed and played with this little insect for some time, and then\r\nconducted it back into the nest.[68]\r\n\r\n  [68] On one occasion several years ago, I saw a number of young ants\r\n  of _L. niger_ brought out of the nest by five or six old ants, which\r\n  watched over the young and kept them from straying away. The young\r\n  ants played about the nest entrance for some time, and were then\r\n  conducted back into the hive by the old ants.--W.\r\n\r\nMany such little animals are kept by the ants as pets. Lubbock says of\r\none of them, a species allied to _Podura_, and for which he proposes the\r\nname _Beckia_, \"It is an active, bustling, little being, and I have kept\r\nhundreds, I may say thousands, in my nests. They run in and out among\r\nthe ants, keeping their antennae in a perpetual state of vibration.\"[69]\r\nI have frequently noticed an insect belonging to the same genus as the\r\nabove in the nests of _F. fusca_ and _F. rufescens_. They reminded me\r\nvery much of the important-looking little dogs one sees running about in\r\nthe crowd on election day.\r\n\r\n  [69] Lubbock, _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_, p. 74.\r\n\r\nThe females of _Coccinellae_ (\"lady-bugs\") frequently congregate and\r\nindulge in performances that cannot be anything else save pastimes. A\r\nbeech tree in my yard is called \"lady-bug tree\" because, year after\r\nyear, these insects collect there and hold their curious conventions.\r\nThey caress one another with their antennae, and gently \"shoulder\" one\r\nanother from side to side. Sometimes several will get their heads\r\ntogether, and seem by their actions to be holding a confidential\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nThese conventions always take place after oviposition, and careful and\r\nrepeated observation has shown me that they are not connected with\r\nprocreation or alimentation. I have witnessed many other instances of\r\ntrue psychical amusement in the lower animals, but do not think it is\r\nnecessary to detail them here. Suffice it to say that I believe that\r\nalmost every living creature, at some period of its existence, has its\r\nmoments of relaxation from the cares of life, when it enjoys the\r\ngratification of amusement.\r\n\r\nSome birds evince aesthetic taste, notably in the building of their\r\nnests, which they ornament and decorate in a manner very pleasing to the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe snakeskin bird gets its name from its habit of using the cast-off\r\nskins of snakes for decorative purposes. Not long ago I found a nest in\r\na small wood, not far from the town in which I live, which was\r\nbeautifully ornamented with the exuviated skin of a black snake\r\n(_Bascanion constrictor_). This skin must have been at least five feet\r\nin length, and the little artists had woven it into the walls of their\r\nnest in such a manner that its translucent, glittering scales contrasted\r\nvery beautifully with the darker materials of their home.\r\n\r\nHumming-birds use bits of lichen and moss to decorate their tiny nests.\r\nThese materials serve a twofold purpose: they not only render the nest\r\nbeautiful, but they also serve to protect it by making it resemble the\r\nlimb on which it is placed. It takes a very acute and discriminating\r\neye, indeed, to locate a humming-bird's nest.\r\n\r\nProbably of all the lower animals, the male satin or bower bird of New\r\nSouth Wales has the decorative feeling the most developed. This bird\r\nbuilds a pleasure resort, a summer-house, or, rather, dance hall, which\r\nhe ornaments profusely with every glittering, shining, striking object\r\nthat he can carry to his bower in the depths of the forest. This bower\r\nis built of twigs, and, when completed, is an oblong, sugar-loaf-like\r\nstructure, open at both ends. The bird decorates his dancing hall (for\r\nhe comes here to perform love-dances during the courting season) with\r\nbright-colored rags, shells, pebbles, bones, etc.\r\n\r\nI once saw a pair of bower birds in captivity (they were owned by Mr.\r\nGeorge Hahn of St. Louis), which constructed the dance hall from\r\nmaterials furnished by their owner.\r\n\r\nThe love of personal cleanliness is, probably, the root and beginning of\r\nmuch that is aesthetic among the lower animals.\r\n\r\nWhen quite a small lad, one of the first lessons set down in my\r\ncopy-book, after I had graduated in \"pot-hooks and hangers,\" was the\r\ntrite old saw, \"Cleanliness is next to godliness.\" My Yankee governess,\r\na tall, angular spinster, from Maine, made the meaning of this copy\r\nclear to my infant mind, pointing her remarks by calling attention to\r\nthe Kentucky real estate which had found a resting-place beneath my\r\nfinger-nails, and which seemed to decorate them with perpetual badges of\r\nmourning. I have never forgotten that lesson and firmly believe in its\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe love of cleanliness seems to be inherent in the lower animals, with\r\nbut few exceptions. We have all noticed the cat, the dog, the squirrel,\r\nthe monkey, and the birds at toilet-making; and we know that they spend\r\na large portion of their time in cleansing and beautifying their bodies.\r\nSome of them are dependent on their own ministrations, while others are\r\ngreatly assisted by humble little servants, whose only remuneration is\r\ndomicile, the cast-off clothing, or the garbage and refuse from their\r\nhost's table.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the common domestic fowl is greatly assisted in its toilet\r\nby certain little animals belonging to the family _Liothe_. These little\r\ncreatures carefully scrape away and eat the scarf-skin, and other\r\nepidermal debris that would otherwise impair the health of their\r\nhosts.[70] Some of the fish family are entirely dependent on the\r\nministrations of mutualists, as these little hygienic servitors are\r\ncalled, in matters of the toilet. Notably, the gilt catfish, which would\r\nundoubtedly die if deprived of its mutualist, the _Gyropeltes_. This\r\nremarkable little creature does not live on the body of its host, but\r\nswims free in the water, and only seeks him when it is hungry. The skin\r\nof the gilt catfish secretes a thick, glairy, mucous exudate, which, if\r\nleft to itself, would imperil the health of the fish. The Gyropeltes,\r\nhowever, regards this exudate as delicious food and rapidly removes and\r\ndevours it.\r\n\r\n  [70] Van Beneden, _Animal Parasites and Messmates_, pp. 71, 72.\r\n\r\nAll insects devote some of their time to the toilet, and there is\r\nprobably no one who has not, at some time or other, noticed the fly, or\r\nsome other insect, thus engaged. The greatest lover of bodily\r\ncleanliness in the whole insect tribe, however, is, I believe, my pet\r\nlocust, \"Whiskers\"--so named by a little niece, on account of her long,\r\ngraceful antennae. \"Whiskers\" is one of the smallest of her family, and\r\nis a dainty, lovely, agile little creature, light olive-green in color,\r\nwith red legs. She was reared from the egg, and has lived in my room all\r\nher short life. She is quite tame and recognizes me as soon as I\r\napproach, often hopping two feet or more in order to light on my\r\ncoat-sleeve or outstretched hand.[71]\r\n\r\n  [71] Shortly after the above was written, this interesting little\r\n  creature met an untimely fate at the hands of an Irish chambermaid,\r\n  who was a recent importation and who did not understand that all life\r\n  was held sacred in my house.--W.\r\n\r\nThe first thing she does, after reaching my hand, is to seek my little\r\nfinger and try her jaws on a diamond ring. The diamond seems to puzzle\r\nher greatly. She sometimes spends several minutes closely examining it.\r\nShe will stand off at a little distance and pass her antennae over every\r\nportion of it. Then she will come closer and make a more minute\r\nexamination, finally essaying another bite with her powerful jaws. A\r\ngreat water drinker, she evidently thinks the stone is some strange kind\r\nof dewdrop, hence her persistent efforts to bite it.\r\n\r\n\"Whiskers\" has developed cannibalistic tastes, for the hardened skin\r\naround my finger-nails is a favorite _morceau_ which she digs out with\r\nher sharp jaws and masticates with seeming delight. She nips out a\r\npiece of skin, cocks her head on one side, and, looking up at me with\r\nher clear, emerald-tinted eyes, her masticatory apparatus working like a\r\ngrist-mill, she seems to say, \"Well! old fellow, this is good.\"\r\n\r\nShe passes most of her time on a bit of turf, in a box on my table,\r\nwhere the sun shines bright and warm. She is fond of water, however, and\r\nmakes frequent excursions to the water-pitcher across the room. How she\r\ndiscovered that it contained water is more than I can tell; but she did,\r\nand she visits it often.\r\n\r\nIt is in her habits of bodily cleanliness, however, that \"Whiskers\"\r\noutshines all other insects. I have watched her at early dawn and have\r\nalways found her at her toilet. This is her first undertaking, even\r\nbefore taking a bite to eat. She makes frequent toilets during the day,\r\nand it is her last occupation at night before sinking to rest on a blade\r\nof grass. Her method of procedure is very interesting. She commences by\r\nfirst carefully cleansing her antennae, drawing each of them through her\r\nmouth repeatedly. Then she treats her fore-legs to a thorough scrubbing,\r\ngoing over every portion with her tongue and jaws. With her fore-legs,\r\nusing them as hands, she then cleans her head and shoulders, if I may\r\nuse the latter term. Her middle legs and her long \"vaulters\" are then\r\nsubjected to the same careful treatment. Her back and the posterior\r\nportion of her abdomen are next rubbed down, she using the last pair of\r\nlegs for this purpose. Finally, standing erect and incurvating her\r\nabdomen between her legs, she cleans it and her ovipositor with her jaws\r\nand tongue. Her toilet is made twenty or thirty times a day. Invariably,\r\nafter one of her excursions to the water-pitcher, as soon as she returns\r\nto her box this is her first occupation.\r\n\r\nNow, having seen that the lower animals possess aesthetic feeling, it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that some of them possess some of the acquired\r\nhigher emotions, such, for instance, as parental affection. The evidence\r\nseems to indicate that some of the lower animals do evince such\r\naffection, as I will now endeavor to point out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPARENTAL AFFECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been claimed that one of the main objections to the doctrine of\r\nkinship, which, undoubtedly, exists between all animals, is the wide\r\ndifference that is to be noted between the solicitude that animals\r\nevince for their young, and the tender love of the human mother and\r\nfather for their children. This difference is more apparent than real;\r\nfor the ethical love, the refined affection of civilized human parents\r\nfor their offspring, is but a psychical culmination of the material and\r\nmatter-of-fact solicitude of the lower animals for the preservation of\r\ntheir kind.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast difference between the psychical habitudes of a\r\ncivilized mother and those of an Aleutian squaw or a Niam-niam\r\n\"pot-boiler\": the love of a civilized mother for her child extends\r\nthroughout its life and even beyond the grave, while the solicitude of\r\nher savage sisters (I use the word in its maternal sense) for their\r\noffspring ceases as soon as the infant toddler is \"tall enough to look\r\ninto the pot.\" The latter emotion is closely akin to the maternal\r\nsolicitude of the higher and lower animals, while the former in its\r\nrefined ethical excellence shows that it is the result of unnumbered\r\nthousands of years of evolutionary growth and development.\r\n\r\nThe love of kind-preservation is inherent in all animals; it ranks next\r\nin psychical strength to self-preservation, and, in some instances, even\r\nsurpasses this so-called \"first law of nature.\" For it very frequently\r\nhappens that the mother, both brute and human (and I use the word\r\n_brute_ as the antithesis of the word _human_, and mean it to embrace\r\nall creatures other than man), will lay down her life in defence of her\r\nyoung, seemingly, utterly forgetting this \"first law\" in her aim to save\r\nher offspring from destruction. Thus the spider whose egg-bag I had\r\ntaken away ran here and there and everywhere in search of it, seemingly\r\ntotally oblivious of my presence. When I extended it to her, clasped\r\nbetween the blades of a small forceps, she seized it with her mandibles\r\nand vainly tried to take it away. When she discovered that this was\r\nimpossible, she turned with fury on the forceps' blades and bit and tore\r\nat them in a perfect frenzy of despairing agony. I removed two of her\r\nfront legs, yet, even when thus maimed and suffering, she never for an\r\ninstant forgot her beloved bag in whose silken meshes so many of her\r\nyoung lay hidden. She continued her efforts to drag the bag away, and\r\nwas so persistent and showed such high courage, that my calloused\r\nsensibilities, hardened by much biological research, were touched, and I\r\ngave her her treasure, which she bore away in triumph.[72]\r\n\r\n  [72] Vide Chap. IV., _The Emotions_, p. 105.\r\n\r\nI, on one occasion, severed an earwig at the injunction of the thorax\r\nand abdomen; the upper portion (the head and thorax) gathered together\r\nits brood of young and safely conducted them into a haven of safety\r\nbeneath the bark of a tree.\r\n\r\nIn crustaceans we probably find the first unmistakable evidences of\r\nmaternal love. The female crayfish, with the under surface of her tail\r\ncovered with impregnated eggs or newly hatched young, will fight to the\r\ndeath in their behalf. I have, time and again, reared crayfish, and have\r\nsucceeded in taming them to such a degree that they would take food from\r\nmy fingers; whenever the females of these crustaceans became mothers,\r\nhowever, they became timid and suspicious and would seek out the darkest\r\nspots in the tanks where they were kept. If I attempted to handle them\r\nthey would nip me with their sharp mandibles at the first opportunity\r\nthat offered; they would allow no interference with their precious\r\noffspring if they could possibly prevent it. This is true of the lobster\r\nalso. This giant crustacean, with her enormous forceps-like claws,\r\ngenerally wages a winning fight with the would-be ravishers of her\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\nI once owned a monkey which was exceedingly fond of shell-fish. On one\r\noccasion I gave him a gravid lobster and came very near losing him\r\nthereby. Usually he seized the lobster or crayfish by its back and then\r\nbroke off its forceps; he would then proceed to suck out its juices and\r\nextract its meat. On this occasion, however, the lobster was rendered\r\nbold and pugnacious by her burden of young, and managed in some way to\r\nclose her forceps on one of the monkey's thumbs. He squalled out, and\r\nhammered the lobster on the bars of his cage in a vain endeavor to rid\r\nhimself of his painful encumbrance. I finally loosened her grasp, but\r\nnot until the flesh on the thumb had been cut to the bone. The wounded\r\nhand became inflamed, erysipelas set in, and the poor animal became very\r\nsick indeed. He eventually recovered, and ever afterward was exceedingly\r\ncareful how he handled shell-fish. He approached them with caution,\r\nkeeping a watchful eye on the dangerous forceps, until, by a quick and\r\nsudden dart of his hand, he could seize and tear them off.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistaken, though quite generally accepted, conclusion that wasps\r\nnever behold their young, hence can readily be instanced, along with the\r\nbutterfly and some other insects, as being creatures that evince\r\nsolicitude for offspring which they never behold. I am quite confident\r\nthat in the tropics certain of the butterflies live to see their young,\r\nfor, on one occasion, Dr. Filipe Miranda told me that he was absolutely\r\ncertain that many of the _Papilioninae_ and _Euplocinae_ of the Amazon\r\nvalley lived at least a year and a half. I have kept alive in my room\r\nspecimens of _Heliconidae_ for six and eight months, while mud-dauber\r\nwasps have repeatedly wintered in my room, and have witnessed the\r\noutcomings of spring broods. Thus, it not infrequently happens that\r\nthese insect mothers are gratified by a sight of their offspring, though\r\nsometimes they evince painstaking care and solicitude toward creatures\r\nwhich they will never see.\r\n\r\nThe pond catfish, so common to the ponds and creeks of the middle and\r\nsouthern states, evinces maternal solicitude in a very marked degree. I\r\nhave frequently seen a school of newly hatched catfish under the\r\nguardianship of an anxious and solicitous mother. She would swim around\r\nand about her frisky and unruly herd, carefully pressing forward all\r\nloiterers and bringing back into the school all stragglers. If a stick\r\nwere thrown among the little fishes, she would dart toward it, and,\r\nseizing it in her mouth, would bear it fiercely away, and would not\r\nloose her hold of it until she had borne it some distance from her brood\r\nof young ones. Bass, white perch, and goggle-eye carefully guard their\r\neggs and drive away all intruders; they likewise keep watchful eyes on\r\nthe young for several days after they have been hatched. During such\r\ntimes these fish can be easily taken, for they will seize anything that\r\ncomes near their nests.\r\n\r\nBaker says of the stickleback, that when the fry made their appearance\r\nfrom the eggs, \"Around, across, and in every direction the male fish, as\r\nthe guardian, continually moved.\" There were three other fish in the\r\naquarium, two tench and a gold carp. As soon as these fish saw the fry,\r\nthey endeavored to devour them, but were driven off by the brave little\r\nfather, which seized their fins and struck with all his might at their\r\neyes and heads.[73]\r\n\r\n  [73] Baker, _Philosophical Trans._; quoted also by Romanes, _loc. cit.\r\n  ante_, p. 245.\r\n\r\n\"The well-known habit of the lophobranchiate fish, of incubating their\r\neggs in their pouches, also displays highly elaborated parental feeling.\r\nM. Risso says when the young of the pipe-fish are hatched out, the\r\nparents show them marked attachment, and that the pouch then serves them\r\nas a place of shelter or retreat from danger.\"[74]\r\n\r\n  [74] Baker, _Philosophical Trans._; quoted also by Romanes, p. 246;\r\n  and Yarrell, _Brit. Fishes_, 2d ed., Vol. II. p. 436.\r\n\r\nAn experimenter, whose name escapes me, on one occasion caught a number\r\nof recently hatched catfish and placed them in a glass jar, close to the\r\nwater's edge. The mother fish soon discovered the presence of her young\r\nones and swam to and fro in front of the jar, evidently much harassed\r\nand worried. She eventually came out on dry land and attempted to get\r\ninto the jar where her young were imprisoned. Truly, a wonderful example\r\nor instance of mother love when self was entirely forgotten in\r\nsolicitude for the offspring!\r\n\r\nThe Surinam toad hatches her eggs and then carries her young about with\r\nher on her back until they are old enough to shift for themselves; the\r\n\"horned toad\" of the southwestern states and Mexico acts in a similar\r\nmanner toward its young.\r\n\r\nI had been informed that snakes evinced parental love for their\r\noffspring, but never until a recent spring had I been able to verify\r\nthis information and give it my unqualified endorsement. In March\r\n(1896), on one of the bright warm days of that phenomenal month, one of\r\nmy dogs attracted my attention by his manoeuvres on my lawn. I noticed\r\nhim walking \"stiff legged\" about a circumscribed spot, now and then\r\ndarting his muzzle towards the ground. On going to him I discovered that\r\nhe had found a lot of snakes, which, influenced by the summer-like\r\nweather, had abandoned their den and had crawled out and were enjoying a\r\nsun-bath. These snakes were knotted together in a ball or roll, but I\r\nquickly discovered that they were all yearlings save one--the mother. I\r\nresolved then and there to test the maternal affection of the mother\r\nsnake for her young, so I killed two of them and dragged their bodies\r\nthrough the grass to the paved walk which ran within a short distance of\r\nthe nest. The old snake and the remainder of her brood took shelter in\r\nthe den; I then retired to a little distance and awaited developments.\r\nIn a very short time the mother emerged from the nest, and, after\r\ncasting about for a moment or so, struck the trail of the young ones\r\nwhich had been dragged through the grass, and followed it to the dead\r\nbodies lying on the pavement. Here she met her fate at the hands of my\r\niceman (whom I had called to witness the great sagacity of this lowly\r\ncreature), for he had killed her ere I could prevent him.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I saw a copperhead (_Ancistrodon contortrix_) in the\r\nmidst of her young, and they seemed to be subservient to her beck and\r\ncall. Before, however, I could satisfy myself positively that the old\r\nsnake really held supervision over her brood, the gentleman with whom I\r\nhappened to be came upon the scene, whereupon the interesting family\r\ndisappeared beneath the undergrowth of the forest.\r\n\r\nThe higher animals sometimes show, unmistakably, that the maternal love\r\nof offspring has taken a step upwards, and that it has become, in a\r\nmeasure, refined by the addition of an aesthetic, if not ethical,\r\nelement. For instance, a dog acquaintance of mine, on the advent of her\r\nfirst puppies seemed to be exceedingly proud of them; she not only\r\nbrought them, one by one, to her mistress for admiration, but she also\r\nbrought them in to show to her master, and yet again, to myself, who\r\nhappened to be visiting her owner at the time. She deposited them, one\r\nby one, at the feet of the person whose regard she solicited, and,\r\nafter they had been admired, she returned them to the kennel. Here, in\r\nmy opinion, was an instance of pride, which has its prototype or\r\nexemplar in the pride of the young human mother who thinks that her baby\r\nis the handsomest child that was ever born! The dog's actions cannot be\r\ntranslated or interpreted otherwise. Again (and in this instance,\r\nstrange to relate, the proud parent was the male), a cat brought his\r\noffspring, one by one, from the basement to my room, two stories above,\r\nin order to exhibit them! He brought them, one at a time, and, after\r\neach had been admired, carried them back to their box in the basement.\r\nLoud were his purs and extravagant were the curl of his tail and the\r\narch of his back! No father of the genus Homo could more plainly evince\r\nhis pride in his baby than did this cat in his kittens. The mother cat\r\ncame with him on his first trip; she evidently did not quite comprehend,\r\nat first, the intentions of her spouse. She soon found out, however,\r\nthat he meant no harm to her young, so she allowed him to work off his\r\nsuperabundance of pride without let or hindrance.\r\n\r\nBirds will defend their young to their uttermost abilities and will\r\noften yield up their lives in unequal combats with the ravagers of their\r\nnests. Last summer I saw two jays whip in a fair fight a large cat,\r\nwhich had attempted to rob their nest. They seemed to have arranged the\r\norder of combat with one another before they attacked the would-be\r\nravisher of their home. The male bird confined his attack to the cat's\r\nhead, while the female went at its body with beak and talons. The\r\nsong-sparrow which remembered the boy who killed the snake which was\r\nabout to devour its young, and whose story I have told elsewhere,\r\nundoubtedly cherished and loved its young. The gratitude which could\r\nchange the timid, wild nature of a bird in such a manner must have had\r\nits origin in a feeling, the depths of which can only be equalled in the\r\npsychical habitudes of the most refined of human beings! As we ascend\r\nhigher in the scale of animal life, we find that new and refining\r\nelements are added to this love for the preservation of kind, until\r\nfinally, in the civilized human being, it has lost its strictly material\r\nfunction and has become wholly and entirely ethical and aesthetic. Yet,\r\nfar back in the beginning, the maternal love or parental love of the\r\ncivilized human being was, fundamentally, based on no higher emotion\r\nthan that engendered by an inherent love for kind-preservation.\r\n\r\nAnimals very frequently turn to man when they find themselves in\r\ndifficulties and need assistance. The following instance of maternal\r\nlove and trust in man in a horse was related to me not long ago, by a\r\nfarmer[75] in whose probity and truthfulness I have implicit confidence.\r\nThe horse in question, a mare, had been placed in a field some distance\r\nfrom the house, in which there was no other stock. The animal was\r\ntotally blind, and, being in foal, it was thought best to place her\r\nthere in order to avoid accidental injury to the colt when it was born.\r\nOne night this gentleman was awakened by a pounding on his front porch\r\nand a continuous and prolonged neighing. He hastily dressed himself,\r\nand, on going out, discovered this blind mare, which had jumped the low\r\nfence surrounding the front yard, and which was pawing the porch with\r\nher front feet and neighing loudly. She whinnied her delight as soon as\r\nshe heard him, and at once jumped the fence as soon as she ascertained\r\nits locality. She then proceeded toward the field, stopping every now\r\nand then to ascertain if he were following, and, when they arrived at\r\nthe field, the horse jumped the fence (a low, rail structure), and\r\nproceeded toward a deep ditch which extended across one corner of the\r\nlot. When she came to the ditch or gully she stopped and neighed once or\r\ntwice. The farmer soon discovered the trouble; the colt had been born\r\nthat night, and, in staggering about, it had accidentally fallen into\r\nthe ditch. He got down into the gully and extricated the little\r\ncreature, much to the delight of its loving mother, which testified her\r\njoy and thankfulness by many a grateful and heartfelt whinny.\r\n\r\n  [75] Mr. Hamilton Alexander, Owensboro, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nAs I have indicated in the first part of the chapter, parental\r\naffection is an acquired emotion which has reached its acme in the\r\ncivilized human being; yet the germs of this highly developed psychical\r\nmanifestation are to be observed in creatures low in the scale of animal\r\nlife. As _psychos_ develops, we observe that this emotion becomes purer\r\nand more refined, until, in some of the higher animals, such as the\r\nmonkey and the dog, it can hardly be distinguished from the parental\r\naffection of certain savages, who leave their children to shift for\r\nthemselves as soon as they are \"tall enough to look into the pot\"; or,\r\nuntil, as Reclus declares of Apache babies, \"they can pluck certain\r\nfruit by themselves, and have caught a rat by their own unaided efforts.\r\nAfter this exploit they go and come as they list.\"[76]\r\n\r\n  [76] Reclus, _Primitive Folk_, p. 131.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in previous chapters that the lower animals possess one or\r\nall of the five senses,--sight, smell, taste, hearing, and touch,--that\r\nthey evince conscious determination; that they possess memory and\r\nclearly indicate that the emotions, in the majority of them at least,\r\nare highly developed; that they likewise give evidence of aestheticism\r\nboth inherited and acquired; and, finally, that they show, unmistakably,\r\nthat they have acquired, to a certain extent, that most refined of all\r\nacquired feeling--parental affection. Now, taking these facts into\r\nconsideration, it would be reasonable to suppose that creatures so\r\nhighly endowed psychically would present evidences of ratiocination.\r\n\r\nThat many of the lower animals do present such evidences is a fact\r\nbeyond dispute, as I will endeavor to show in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nREASON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe simplest and truest definition of reason is, I take it, the\r\nintelligent correlation of ideation and action for definite purposes\r\nnot instinctive. The casual observer and a very large majority of the\r\ncreationists deny the presence of reason in the lower animals, and group\r\nall psychical manifestations that are to be observed in animals lower\r\nthan man under the head of instinct, forgetting that almost every\r\ninstinctive habit must have been, in the beginning, necessarily the\r\nresult of conscious determination.\r\n\r\nInstinct is, in a certain sense, a process of ratiocination, though its\r\nimmediate operations may not be due to reason. Instinct involves mental\r\noperations; if it did not, it would be simply reflex action. It is\r\nheredity under a special name; the father transmits his mental\r\npeculiarities as well as his corporeal individualities to his offspring.\r\nThe experiences of thousands of years leave their imprint on the\r\nsucceeding generations, until deductions and conclusions drawn from these\r\nexperiences no longer require any special act of reason in order to bring\r\nabout certain results. These results, which were, at first, the outcome\r\nof special acts of ratiocination, or accidental happenings leading to the\r\ngood of the creature or creatures in which they occurred, finally became\r\nhabitual and instinctive.\r\n\r\nThese special acts of ratiocination are of daily, of hourly, occurrence\r\nin the lives of countless myriads of the lower animals, and escape our\r\nobservation because of the obtuseness of our senses. Every now and then,\r\nhowever, the observer is able to chronicle such an act of reason, and\r\nthus adduce the proposition that if the creature or creatures were\r\ncontinually placed in surroundings requiring a like act of reason, that\r\nact would eventually become habitual and instinctive on the part of that\r\ncreature or those creatures. I have witnessed hundreds of acts of\r\nintelligent ratiocination in the lower animals that were not called\r\nforth by experience and which had not a single faculty of heredity. For\r\ninstance, several years ago I noticed that one of the combs in a\r\nbeehive, owing to the extreme heat, had become melted at the top and was\r\nin great danger of falling to the floor. The bees had noticed this\r\nimpending calamity long before I had, and had already set about averting\r\nit. They rapidly threw out a buttress or supporting pillar from the comb\r\nnext to the one in danger, and joined it firmly to it, thus shoring it\r\nup and preventing its fall in a most effectual manner. When they had\r\nmade everything strong and secure, they went to the top of the comb and\r\nreattached it to the ceiling of the hive. After this had been done to\r\ntheir satisfaction, they removed the shoring pillar and used the wax\r\nelsewhere. In this instance, there was an immediate adaptation of\r\nthemselves to surrounding circumstances, in which they averted and\r\nprevented an utterly unforeseen and unheard-of catastrophe by means as\r\neffectual as they were intelligent. Could man do more or reason better?\r\nHere was an experience which had not happened to them in hundreds and\r\nhundreds of generations, perhaps; which, perhaps, had never happened to\r\nthem before, and yet, when it did happen, their quick intelligence\r\nreadily grasped the situation, and they at once set about remedying the\r\nevil.[77]\r\n\r\n  [77] Compare Huber, Vol. II. p. 280; see also Chap. IV. of this work.\r\n\r\nA mud-dauber wasp built a nest in my room, and used an open ventilating\r\nwindow as an entrance and exit. On one occasion this window happened to\r\nbe closed, and the wasp, not noticing the clear glass, flew against it\r\nwith great violence. She fell to the floor stunned, but when she had\r\nrecovered from the effects of the blow, she flew here and there about\r\nthe room as if looking for another exit. Finally, she discovered a small\r\ncrevice in the casing, through which she at once crawled. She then went\r\nback and forth through this crack until she had become thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the new road. She never again essayed the window, though\r\nit was left open the entire summer.\r\n\r\nIn this instance the wasp was taught by a single experience to seek out\r\na new road. This experience was wholly new to her, consequently, she\r\nmust have used correlative ideation for definite purposes in formulating\r\nher method of procedure. Although ants, bees, and wasps have highly\r\ndeveloped memories, and seem to be likewise in possession of that\r\npeculiar function of the mind called by some psychologists \"unconscious\r\nmemory,\" through which they are, probably, enabled to transmit\r\nimpressions of comparatively recent experiences to their offspring, I\r\nhardly think that the mud-dauber was influenced in her actions by any\r\nsuch inherited instinct. Such a conclusion seems to be unwarranted by\r\nthe facts in the case. Mud-daubers may have bumped their heads against\r\nwindows ever since windows came into existence, but not with sufficient\r\nfrequency to cause them to possess an instinct that taught them to avoid\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nAgain, the ground wasp, whose hole between the bricks of a pavement I\r\nstopped with a wad of paper, and which learned to go down into the\r\nsulcus between the bricks and to pull the paper in the direction of its\r\nlong axis in order to remove the obstruction, must have used correlative\r\nideation in order to grasp the problem that was set her to solve.\r\n\r\nFrom certain observation I am inclined to believe that psychical traits\r\nwhich are the result of thousands of years of experience before they\r\nbecome part and parcel of the human _psychos_ may become psychic\r\nactualities in ants, bees, and wasps in the course of a few generations.\r\nThe facility with which these creatures adapt themselves to new\r\nenvironments--in which their very organisms, physical and psychical, are\r\nchanged to a certain extent--is abundant proof of the truth of this\r\nconclusion. All experiments with the Hymenoptera amid changed\r\nsurroundings indicate an intelligent adaptation of themselves to such\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nThe ant is the only animal, except man, which has slaves and domestic\r\nanimals. Their intelligence is so highly developed that they make a\r\nperfect success in rearing their cattle and capturing their slaves. The\r\ncattle of the ants are of the order _Aphididae_. The herdsmen of these\r\naphidian cattle can be seen patrolling the shrubs on which the aphides\r\nare grazing. On them devolves the care of the herds. They bring them out\r\nin the morning and carry them back at night. They gather the eggs of the\r\naphides, carry them into a specially built nursery, attend them\r\ncarefully until the young aphides are hatched out, and then carry them\r\nto the shrubs most liked by them for food. Some strange sense enables\r\nthem to recognize one another--an ant of the same species, but coming\r\nfrom another nest, is immediately recognized as a stranger, and at once\r\nattacked. If the eggs of one ant colony are hatched out in another of\r\nthe same species, the young ants are at once known to be strangers and\r\nintruders. This far transcends our intelligence. What mother could\r\nrecognize her infant if it were born in the dark and she had never seen\r\nit? Again, if the larvae of ants are removed, hatched outside of the\r\nnest, and then returned, the ants at once recognize them as kinsmen and\r\nreceive them into the nest.\r\n\r\nWhen we take into the consideration that an ant's brain has gray matter\r\nanalogous to the gray matter found in the cortex of the human brain, we\r\nshould not feel surprised when we find striking evidences of\r\nratiocination in these little creatures. The better creatures are able\r\nto communicate ideation or thought, the stronger and more frequent are\r\nthe evidences of their possession of reason. Ants can undoubtedly\r\ncommunicate; how and in what manner, it is not generally agreed.\r\n\r\nSome time ago I crushed an ant in a path usually taken by the\r\ninhabitants of a nest (which was situated in a hollow tree) in their\r\njourneys to and fro. A soldier ant came along presently, and, smelling\r\nthe blood[78] of her murdered companion, was seized by a sudden terror\r\nand fled away into the nest. She soon returned, however, with thirteen\r\nother soldier ants, and made a careful examination of the body and its\r\nsurroundings. Her companions also examined the corpse, and, having\r\nsatisfied themselves that their comrade was dead, and that her murderer\r\nwas not to be found, returned to the nest. Soon afterwards a large\r\nworker ant, guarded by two soldier ants, came out, and, proceeding to\r\nthe body, picked it up, carried it down the tree and away beneath the\r\ngrass, where I lost sight of them.\r\n\r\n  [78] In order to avoid technicalities I think it best to use synonyms\r\n  with which the general student is familiar. The non-technical reader\r\n  will know at once what is meant by the \"blood\" of the ant.--W.\r\n\r\nIn this instance there is every evidence of complex reasoning; the\r\ndiscoverer of the murder hurried away into the nest, where she gave the\r\nalarm; the police of the community--the soldier ants--went immediately\r\nto the scene of the tragedy, made an examination, and then returned and\r\ngave in their report; the undertaker, in the shape of the large worker\r\nant, then went out, got the body, carried it away and buried it; the two\r\nsoldier ants followed the body to the grave in order to protect it from\r\ncannibal ants.\r\n\r\nIt has been my good fortune to have witnessed several pitched battles\r\nbetween large bodies of ants. In a battle between some black ants and some\r\nyellow antagonists of another species, I saw many evidences of intelligent\r\ncommunication. The yellow ants had a commissariat and an ambulance corps;\r\nand I frequently saw them drop to the rear during the battle, and partake\r\nof refreshments or have their wounds attended to. The blacks, which\r\ncomposed the attacking army, were in light marching order, and had neither\r\nof these conveniences and necessary adjuncts. The yellow ants frequently\r\nsent back to their village for reenforcements; the ants that had been out\r\non hunting expeditions when the battle was joined were notified as soon as\r\nthey arrived at the nest, and immediately hurried off to join in the fray.\r\nThe blacks had discovered a herd of aphides belonging to the yellows, and\r\nhad sought to surprise the guards and steal the herd; hence the battle. I\r\nam glad to report that the black horde was defeated by the brave yellow\r\nwarriors and had to decamp, leaving many of its number dead upon the field\r\nof battle.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I saw an army of red ants besieging a colony of\r\nsmall black ants. The object of the red ants was the theft of the pupae\r\nor young of the black ants. These pupae they take to their own nest and\r\nrear as slaves, the enslaved ants to all appearances becoming entirely\r\nsatisfied with their condition, and working for their masters willingly\r\nand without demur. The besieged ants evinced a high degree of reason and\r\nforethought, for, as soon as the presence of the besiegers was noticed,\r\nstrong guards were posted in all of the approaches to the nest, both\r\nfront and rear. The red ants sent a detachment to surprise the colony\r\nfrom the rear; but they found that surprise was impossible, for they\r\nwere met by a strong party of their gallant foes which vigorously\r\nopposed them. The red ants were, however, eventually victorious, and\r\nsacked the town, carrying away with them a large number of pupae.\r\n\r\nI cheerfully bear witness to the fact that the great myrmecologist,\r\nHuber, was correct in his description of his experiment with the black\r\nslave.[79]\r\n\r\n  [79] Huber, _The Natural History of Ants_, p. 249; quoted also by\r\n  Lubbock, _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_, p. 83; Romanes, _Animal\r\n  Intelligence_, p. 65; Kirby and Spence, _Entomology_, p. 369 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  Our species of blacks and reds differ but very little in form and\r\n  habits from their European kin; so the experiment may be easily\r\n  performed by any one at all interested in this remarkable instance of\r\n  \"slave master, and master slave.\"--W.\r\n\r\nLike Huber, I put some of these red slave-owners into a glass jar in\r\nwhich I placed an abundance of food. Notwithstanding the fact that this\r\nfood was easy of access, being in fact immediately beneath their jaws,\r\nthey would not touch it! I then placed a black slave in the jar; she at\r\nonce went to her masters, and, after thoroughly cleansing them with her\r\ntongue, gave them food. These red ants would have starved to death in\r\nthe midst of plenty, if they had been left to themselves.\r\n\r\nThis, at first glance, would seem to indicate an utter absence of reason\r\nin these red slave-owners. Such a conclusion, however, is by no means\r\ntrue. The facts indicate mental degeneration. So utterly subservient\r\nhad they become to the ministration of the slaves, that they had even\r\nlost the faculty of feeding themselves!\r\n\r\nHere, we have an example of degeneration in the mentality of an animal\r\nincident to the enervating influence of slavery. Sir John Lubbock's\r\nremarks anent the four genera of slave-making ants are so interesting\r\nthat I may be pardoned for quoting them entire. Says he:--\r\n\r\n\"These four genera\" (_Formica sanguinea_, _Polyergus_,\r\n_Strongylognathus_, _and Anergates_) \"offer us every gradation from\r\nlawless violence to contemptible parasitism.\r\n\r\n\"_Formica sanguinea_, which may be assumed to have comparatively\r\nrecently taken to slave-making, has not yet been materially affected.\r\n\r\n\"_Polyergus_, on the contrary, already illustrates the lowering tendency\r\nof slavery. They have lost their knowledge of art, their natural\r\naffection for their young, and even the instinct of feeding. They are,\r\nhowever, bold and powerful marauders.\r\n\r\n\"In _Strongylognathus_ the enervating influence of slavery has gone\r\nfurther, and told even on the bodily strength. They are no longer able\r\nto capture their slaves in open warfare. Still they retain a semblance\r\nof authority, and, when aroused, will fight bravely, though in vain.\r\n\r\n\"In _Anergates_, finally, we come to the last scene of this sad history.\r\nWe may safely conclude that in distant times their ancestors lived, as\r\nso many ants do now, partly by hunting, partly on honey; that by\r\ndegrees they became bold marauders, and gradually took to keeping\r\nslaves; that for a time they maintained their strength and agility,\r\nthough losing by degrees their real independence, their arts, and many\r\nof their instincts; that gradually even their bodily force dwindled away\r\nunder the enervating influence to which they had subjected themselves,\r\nuntil they sank to their present degraded condition--weak in body and\r\nmind, few in numbers and apparently nearly extinct, the miserable\r\nrepresentatives of far superior ancestors, maintaining a precarious\r\nexistence as contemptible parasites of their former slaves.\"[80]\r\n\r\n  [80] Lubbock, _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_, pp. 88, 89.\r\n\r\nThis is truly a wonderful picture of mental and physical degeneration\r\nincident to the enervating influences of slavery. That it is a true one,\r\nan abundance of data most emphatically declares. The influence of\r\nslavery on the human race (the masters) shows very plainly that man\r\nhimself quickly, comparatively speaking, loses his stamina when\r\nsubjected to it.\r\n\r\nThis fact is but another proof of the kinship of all animals, and the\r\nsimilarity, nay, the sameness, of mind in man and the lower animals;\r\nmind is the same in kind, though differing in degree.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is placed amid new and unfamiliar surroundings\r\nnecessitating the evolvement of intelligent action in order to meet the\r\nnecessities of such environment, such an animal evinces ratiocination.\r\nI have seen many instances of such action on the part of ants. The\r\nfollowing data concerning the natural history of the honey-making ant\r\n(_Myrmecocystus mexicanus_) are taken from my note-book.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1887 I spent several weeks in New Mexico, and while\r\nthere had the great good fortune to discover a colony of honey-making\r\nants. I found these ants in a little valley debouching out of Huerfanos\r\nPark, a government reservation, I believe, at that time. The nest was\r\nsituated on the sandy shore of a small creek, and was a perfect square\r\nof three or four feet, from which all grass, weeds, etc., had been\r\ncarefully removed. Around three sides of this square, viz., north, east,\r\nand west, a column of black soldier ants continually patrolled night and\r\nday.\r\n\r\nNear the southeast corner of this open space the entrance to the nest\r\nwas situated. The south side of the square was not guarded, but was left\r\nopen for the entrance and exit of the hundreds of dark yellow workers\r\nwhich were engaged in bringing food to the village. No sooner was a\r\nburden put down than it was seized by black workers, which then carried\r\nit into the nest. At no time did I see a black worker bringing food to\r\nthe centre of the square, nor did I ever see a yellow worker carrying\r\nfood into the nest; the blacks and the yellows never interfered with one\r\nanother's business.\r\n\r\nTo test the reasoning powers of these ants, I partially disabled a\r\ncentipede and threw it into the square a short distance from the patrol\r\nline. For a moment or two the line was broken by the warriors hurrying\r\nout to do battle with the squirming intruder. But only for a moment or\r\ntwo, for orders were issued by some ant in authority (so it seemed, and\r\nso I believe), and the line was established, though somewhat thinned by\r\nthe absence of soldiers. The messenger was sent to headquarters and\r\nreenforcements were sent out, and soon the line was as strong as ever,\r\nthough hundreds of soldiers were warring with the centipede. The latter\r\nwas soon killed, and its body was removed piecemeal by the yellow\r\nworkers, which carried the fragments far beyond the boundaries of the\r\nsquare.\r\n\r\nAgain, with my hunting-knife I dug a deep trench across the border of\r\none side of the square. The ants seemed dazed at first, but rapidly\r\nadapted themselves to their new surroundings. They extended their patrol\r\nline until it embraced the entire trench; then a countless horde of\r\nyellow workers went to work, and in a day's time filled up the deep\r\nexcavation level with the surrounding surface! The patrol was then\r\nreestablished on the old line as though nothing had occurred to\r\ninterrupt the ordinary routine of the colony. Before leaving the valley\r\nI dug up the nest and examined the peculiar individuals whose enforced\r\nhabits give to these interesting ants the name of \"honey-makers.\" Each\r\none of these curious creatures was confined in a separate cell, the\r\nentrance to which was very small. Here they lived in absolute seclusion,\r\nbeing fed by the black workers with pollen, the nectar of flowers,\r\ntender herbs, etc.\r\n\r\nThrough some wonderful chemical process this food was turned into a\r\ndelicious honey, the flavor of which (I ate of it freely) was distinctly\r\nwiny and aromatic.\r\n\r\nApparently, they had no anal orifices, these passages probably having\r\nbeen obliterated. These imprisoned honey-makers were merely animated\r\nbags of honey, and were kept by the other ants solely for the purpose of\r\nfurnishing a never failing supply of sweet and wholesome food.[81]\r\n\r\n  [81] Compare Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, p. 111 _et seq._ At the\r\n  time when these details were written in my note-book I was\r\n  unacquainted with Captain Fleeson's and Mr. Edwards's observations,\r\n  nor had I read Romanes's work on _Animal Intelligence_. I had heard of\r\n  _Myrmecocystus_, of course, but knew nothing of its natural history.\r\n  Comparison will show that my observations differ from those of the\r\n  gentlemen mentioned above. I saw nothing whatever of the web described\r\n  by Captain Fleeson: the honey-making _solitaires_ were simply confined\r\n  in cells, where they rested on the bare ground; they were not perched\r\n  upon \"a network of squares, like a spider's web.\" The \"outside\"\r\n  workers observed by me were not black, but very dark yellow, while the\r\n  \"inside\" workers were bright yellow in color.--W.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which these ants set to work to fill in the trench\r\nmade by my hunting-knife showed that they recognized, at once, the\r\ncalamity that had befallen them, and that they used rational methods in\r\nremedying the evil.\r\n\r\nThe fact that they have evolved the idea of setting aside certain\r\nmembers of the colony as honey-makers, and that there is a distinct\r\nrecognition of a division, or divisions, in the labor of the inhabitants\r\nof the nest, evinces very high psychical development.\r\n\r\nIn a colony of _Termes_, or white ants, so-called, there are five kinds of\r\nindividuals. _First_, the workers. These do all the work of the nest,\r\ncollecting provisions, waiting on the queen, carrying eggs to the\r\nnurseries, feeding the young until they are old enough to care for\r\nthemselves, repairing and erecting buildings, etc. _Second_, the nymphs.\r\nThese differ in nothing from the workers, except that they have\r\nrudimentary wings. _Third_, the neuters. These are much less in numbers\r\nthan the workers, but exceed them greatly in bulk. They have long and very\r\nlarge heads, armed with powerful mandibles, and are the sentinels and\r\nsoldiers of the colony. These neuters are blind. _Fourth_ and _Fifth_, the\r\nmales and females. These are the perfect insects, capable of continuing\r\nthe species. There is only one each in every separate society. They are\r\nexempted from all labor, and are the common father and mother of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nTermes inhabit tropical countries, and the first establishment of new\r\ncolonies takes place in this way: In the evening, at the end of the dry\r\nseason, the males and females, having arrived at their perfect state,\r\nemerge from their nest in countless thousands. They have two pairs of\r\nwings, and with their aid mount immediately into the air. The next\r\nmorning they are found covering the ground, and deprived of their wings.\r\nThey then mate. Scarcely a single pair in many millions escape their\r\nenemies--birds, reptiles, beasts, fishes, insects, especially the other\r\nants, and even man himself. The workers, which are continually prowling\r\nabout their covered ways, occasionally meet one of these pairs. They\r\nimmediately salute them, render them homage, and elect them father and\r\nmother of a new colony. All other pairs not so fortunate perish.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they are chosen king and queen, or rather, father and mother,\r\nthey are conducted into the nest, where the workers build around them a\r\nsuitable cell, the entrances to which are large enough for themselves\r\nand the neuters or soldiers to pass through, but too small for the royal\r\npair. Thus they remain in prison as long as they live. They are\r\nfurnished with every delicacy, but are never allowed to leave their\r\nprison. The female soon begins to oviposit--the eggs, as fast as they\r\nare dropped, being carried away into the nurseries by the workers. As\r\nthe queen increases in dimensions, they keep enlarging the cell in which\r\nshe is confined. Her abdomen begins to extend until it is two thousand\r\ntimes the size of the rest of the body, and her bulk equals that of\r\ntwenty thousand workers. She becomes one vast matrix of eggs. I once saw\r\na queen which measured three and one quarter inches from one extremity\r\nof her body to the other. There is continual oviposition, the queen\r\nlaying over eighty thousand eggs in twenty-four hours, or one egg every\r\nsecond. As these females live about two years, they will lay some sixty\r\nmillion eggs.\r\n\r\nIn the royal cell there are always some soldiers on guard and workers\r\nadministering to the royal pair. The activity and energy of these\r\nworkers is truly wonderful. In New Mexico, where I found a family of\r\ninsects closely resembling true _Termes_, I once had an opportunity of\r\nobserving this extraordinary energy. I broke off a portion of their\r\ndome-shaped nest, and in an incredibly short time they had mended the\r\nbreach and restored their domicile to the same condition it was before I\r\nhad molested it. If you attack a termite building and make a slight\r\nbreach in its walls, the laborers immediately retire into the inmost\r\nrecesses of the nest and give place to another class of its inhabitants,\r\nthe warriors. Several soldiers come out to reconnoitre, they then retire\r\nand give the alarm. Then several more come out as quickly as possible,\r\nfollowed in a few moments by a large battalion. Their anger and fury are\r\nexcessive. If you continue to molest them, their anger leaps all bounds.\r\nThey rush out in myriads, and, being blind, bite everything with which\r\nthey come in contact.[82] If, however, the attack is not continued, they\r\nretire into the nest, with the exception of two or three which remain\r\noutside. The workers then appear and begin to repair the damaged wall.\r\nOne of the soldiers remaining outside acts as overseer and superintendent\r\nof construction. At intervals of a minute or two it will strike the wall\r\nwith its mandibles, making a peculiar sound. This is answered by the\r\nworkers with a loud hiss and a marked acceleration in their movements.\r\nShould these ants again be disturbed, the laborers would vanish, and the\r\nwarriors would take their places, ready and willing to fight to the death\r\nin defence of their community.[82]\r\n\r\n  [82] Compare Kirby and Spence, _Entomology_.\r\n\r\nWhile it is undoubtedly true that instinct can be highly differentiated,\r\nso that in its action it seemingly approaches reason, it is also equally\r\ntrue that instinct, fundamentally, is but a blind impulse. The impulse\r\nto fight on the part of these soldier termites is, unquestionably,\r\ninstinctive, but the psychical habitudes which originate division and\r\npartition of labor, which set apart certain individuals (in no wise\r\ndifferent from their fellows) as officers and overseers, which, beyond\r\nperadventure, are able to incite the laborers to greater effort by\r\ncommands that are clearly understood and intelligently obeyed, surely\r\nsuch psychical characteristics cannot be embraced in the category of\r\ninstinctive impulses--mere blind followings-out of inherited\r\nimpressions!\r\n\r\nInstinct is the bugbear of psychology and does more to retard\r\ninvestigation than any other factor. As long as people of the creationist\r\nstamp wield the instinct-club, just so long will they be unable to grasp\r\nthe idea of intelligent ratiocination in the lower animals. A company of\r\nmen rebuilding a wall which has been overthrown by a tempest are said to\r\nbe governed and directed by reason, while a company of ants doing\r\nprecisely the same thing, and with just as much intelligence, are said to\r\nbe directed by instinct![83]\r\n\r\n  [83] It is often the case that animals find themselves amid\r\n  surroundings in which they are required to evince original ideation\r\n  and fail so to do. But, is man any different? How often do we find\r\n  ourselves checkmated and puzzled by trivial circumstances, which, on\r\n  being explained, are seen to be exceedingly simple!--W.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Hell's-Half-Acre, a desolate and rocky valley a\r\nshort distance from Hot Springs, Arkansas, in 1887, I discovered several\r\ncommunities of harvester ants, and closely and carefully observed their\r\nhabits. The first time I noticed them was early in the spring, when they\r\nseemed to be engaged in planting their grain. They were bringing out the\r\nlittle grass-seeds by the hundreds and thousands, and carrying them some\r\ndistance from the nest, where they were dropped on the turf. It is\r\npossible that these ants were only getting rid of spoiled grain, but I\r\nthink not, for several of the seeds secured and planted by me germinated.\r\nI observed them again in about a month, and the grass was growing finely\r\non the plat where they had deposited the seeds. Not a single stalk of any\r\nother kind of grass and not a single weed were to be seen in this model\r\ngrain-field. The ants had evidently removed every plant that might\r\ninterfere with the growth of their grain.\r\n\r\nI saw them again in August when they were reaping the crop and storing\r\nthe grain away in their nests. The ants would climb the grass-stems\r\nuntil they came to the seeds; these they would then seize in their\r\nmandibles, outer sheath and all, and, by vigorously twisting them from\r\nside to side, would separate them from the stalk; they would then crawl\r\ndown and carry them into the nest. I did not notice here the roads and\r\npathways so generally found leading to the nests of the Texas variety of\r\nthe harvester. Around the nests the surface of the ground was smooth and\r\nbare, but there were no highways or roads leading to them.\r\n\r\nAmong the workers I saw some ants whose heads and mandibles were very\r\nlarge. These ants never engaged in any of the agricultural pursuits of\r\ntheir sisters; they were the soldiers and the sentinels of the community.\r\nOne nest migrated while I had them under observation, and I had the\r\npleasure of witnessing the behavior of these fearless little warriors\r\nwhen on the march. The ants were moving nearer to their grain-fields,\r\nand were carrying with them their young, etc. The route, from the old\r\nhome to the new, was patrolled on either side by soldiers. Every now\r\nand then I saw one of these individuals rush aside, elevate herself on\r\nher hind legs, shake her head, and clash her mandibles. She acted as if\r\nshe saw some danger menacing the marching column and would ward it off.\r\nOthers climbed little twigs or tufts of grass and scanned the surrounding\r\ncountry from these elevated and commanding positions. Others hurried up\r\nthe laggards and stragglers, and even carried the weak and infirm.\r\n\r\nThese ants winnow or husk the grain after it has been carried into the\r\nnest. All during the harvesting I observed workers bringing chaff from the\r\nnest and carrying it some distance away. It is said by Texan observers\r\nthat the harvesters of that state bring the grain to the surface and dry\r\nit, if, perchance, it becomes wet. I have never observed this myself, but\r\naccept it as an established fact.[84]\r\n\r\n  [84] I believe that these observations on the presence of the\r\n  harvester ant in Arkansas are unique; at least I have been unable to\r\n  find any data corroborative of this fact. How did a fecundated queen\r\n  arrive at a spot so far from her usual habitat?--W.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of computing is among the very last of the psychical habitudes\r\nacquired by man, and is an evidence of high ratiocinative ability. Many of\r\nthe savage races are unable to count above three,--some not above\r\nfive,--thus demonstrating the truthfulness of the above assertion. Yet I\r\nbelieve that it can be clearly shown that some of the lower animals and\r\nmany of the higher animals are able to count.\r\n\r\nThe mason wasps, or mud-daubers, build their compartment houses generally\r\nin places easily accessible to the investigator; therefore the experiments\r\nand observations which I am about to detail can be duplicated and verified\r\nwithout difficulty. These interesting members of the Hymenoptera, the\r\n_avant-couriers_ of the social insects, can be seen any bright day in\r\nAugust or September busily engaged on the margins of ponds, ditches, and\r\npuddles in the procurement of building materials. They will alight close\r\nto the water's edge, and, vibrating their wings rapidly, will run hither\r\nand thither over the moist clay until they arrive at a spot which, in\r\ntheir opinion, will furnish suitable mortar. Quickly biting up a pellet of\r\nmud, they moisten it with saliva, all the while kneading it and rolling it\r\nbetween maxillae and palpi. When it has reached the proper consistency they\r\nbear it away to some dry, warm place, such as the rafters of an outhouse\r\nor a garret, and there use it in the construction of their adobe or mud\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nThere may be dozens of these nests in the process of construction, and\r\narranged on the rafters, side by side, yet these busy little masons\r\nnever make the mistake of confounding the houses; after securing mortar\r\nthey invariably return, each to her own structure. This statement can be\r\neasily verified. While the insect is engaged in applying the mortar,\r\ntake a camel's-hair brush and quickly paint a small spot on her\r\nshoulders with a mixture of zinc oxide and gum arabic; then mark the\r\nnest. The marked wasp will always return to the marked nest.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cells are completed, the wasp deposits an egg in each,\r\nand immediately begins to busy herself about the future welfare of the\r\ncoming baby wasps. Just here these remarkable creatures show that they\r\npossess a mental faculty which far transcends any like act of human\r\nintelligence; they are able to tell which of the eggs will produce males\r\nand which females. Not only are they able to do this, but, seemingly\r\nfully aware of the fact that it takes a longer time for the female larvae\r\nto pupate than it does the male larvae, they provide for this emergency\r\nby depositing in the cells containing female eggs a larger amount of\r\nfood. It is in the procurement and storage of this food-supply that\r\nthese insects give unmistakable evidence of the possession by them of\r\nthe faculty of computing.\r\n\r\nThe knowing little mother is well aware of the fact that as soon as the\r\negg hatches the young grub will need food, and an abundance of food at\r\nthat; so, before closing the orifice of the cell, she packs away in it\r\nthe favorite food of her offspring, which is spiders. She knows that in\r\nthe close, hot cell the spiders, if dead, would soon become putrid and\r\nunfit for food: therefore, she does not kill them outright, but simply\r\nanaesthetizes them by instilling a small amount of poison through that\r\nsharp and efficacious hypodermic needle, her sting.[85]\r\n\r\n  [85] As a matter of fact I have kept Argiope under observation in this\r\n  anaesthetized condition for _thirteen weeks_.--W.\r\n\r\nEach variety of masons uses a different spider; the common blue mason is\r\npartial to the beautiful Argiope, which, banded as it is with gray and\r\nyellow, is a very conspicuous object when seen on its glistening,\r\nupright web.\r\n\r\nThe wasp larva, as soon as it emerges from the egg-membrane, finds fresh\r\nand palatable food before its very nose, and at once begins to eat.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the male larvae, five spiders are deposited in each cell,\r\nwhile eight are always placed in the female compartments.[86] If one or\r\nmore spiders are removed from the cell, the mother wasp does not appear\r\nto notice that her food-supply has been tampered with; she completes her\r\nquota, five for the males and eight for the females, and then closes the\r\ncell, no matter if there remains in the compartment one, two, or three\r\nspiders. Her count calls for five or eight, as the case may be, and,\r\nwhen she has put on top of the egg the requisite number according to her\r\ncount, her responsibility ceases.\r\n\r\n  [86] Compare Kirby and Spence, _Entomology_, pp. 231, 232, habits of\r\n  _Epipone spinipes_ in regard to small grubs.\r\n\r\nI have never known a mud-dauber to make a mistake in her computation,\r\nalthough I have endeavored to puzzle this little arithmetician time and\r\nagain. If a wad of paper be placed in a cell after two or three spiders\r\nhave been deposited, thus partially filling it, the insect knows at once\r\nthat something is wrong, and will proceed to investigate. She will\r\nremove the spiders on top of the paper, will extract the wad, and will\r\nthen proceed with her count. On the other hand, if several spiders be\r\ntaken out when the count calls for only one or two more, the wasp does\r\nnot appear to notice that the cell is almost empty; she finishes her\r\ncount as if everything were correct, and then seals up the opening with\r\nmud.\r\n\r\nThe quail lays some twelve or fifteen eggs, and seems to be aware of the\r\nfact that some of her eggs are missing when several have been removed\r\nfrom the nest. When one of these birds has laid six or eight eggs, if\r\ntwo or three be removed she will abandon the nest and deposit the\r\nremainder of her eggs elsewhere. This behavior on the part of the bird\r\nhas been attributed to her sense of smell; she, detecting the presence\r\nof an enemy by the scent of his hand left behind in the nest, recognizes\r\nthe danger, and therefore abandons the nest. But numerous experiments\r\nalong this line teach me that smell has nothing to do with it whatever.\r\nI have removed eggs with a long iron ladle, the bowl of which I had\r\ncarefully refrained from touching, and also with sticks freshly cut in\r\nthe wood, and yet the birds would invariably abandon their nests. On the\r\ncontrary, when all, or nearly all, the eggs have been laid, several may\r\nbe removed either with the ladle or with the naked hand, and yet the\r\nbird will not abandon her nest. She seems to be able to count up to six\r\nor eight; beyond this latter number her faculty of computing does not\r\nextend. After the full laying has been deposited in the nest and the\r\nprocess of incubation has become established, a large number of the eggs\r\nmay be removed, and yet the bird will continue to set until the\r\nremaining eggs have been hatched out.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of computing seems to be present in other birds to some\r\nextent; the domesticated guinea-fowl and the turkey sometimes possess it\r\nin a marked degree, though in most of these fowls domestication has\r\nalmost entirely eradicated it. The domestic barnyard hen has had her\r\nnest robbed for such a long period of time that she has lost the faculty\r\nof counting. But even this meek provider of food for mankind is able, in\r\nsome instances, to count one: she will not lay in her nest unless a\r\nnest-egg be left to delude her. The nest-egg may be wholly factitious\r\nand made of china, marble, chalk, stone or iron painted white; the hen\r\ndoes not seem to care so long as it bears some resemblance to an egg.\r\n\r\nThat the turkey-hen can count, the following instance occurring under\r\nmy own observation would seem to indicate. The bird had a nest in my\r\ngarden in which she had deposited three eggs. One day another turkey,\r\nseized with a desire of ovipositing, spied this nest and laid an egg\r\ntherein. The original owner of the nest came along soon after the\r\ninterloper had left her egg; she examined the nest carefully, and turned\r\nthe eggs with her beak. Finally she thrust her beak through the shell of\r\nan egg and bore it far from the nest before dropping it on the ground.\r\nNow, as far as I could tell, the eggs were alike, but the sharper and\r\nmore discriminating eyes of the turkey undoubtedly saw, on close\r\nexamination, some peculiarity in color or shape in the stranger's egg,\r\nand therefore bore it away and destroyed it. I believe, however, that\r\nher attention was arrested at first by the unexpected number of eggs in\r\nthe nest, and that she was enabled to detect the stranger's egg only\r\nafter much inspection and comparison.\r\n\r\nMany animals have been taught to count, but none of them show that they\r\nfully appreciate the value of numerical rotation. Of course, in the vast\r\nmajority of trained animals, the seeming appreciation is only a trick\r\nfounded on the sense of smell, sight, touch, or taste.\r\n\r\nAn instance recently came under my personal observation in which a dog,\r\na high-bred collie, seemingly evinced an abstract idea of numbers. The\r\nanimal in question received an injury a year or so ago through which\r\nshe became permanently and totally blind. Recently she gave birth to a\r\nlitter of six puppies, all of which were uniform in size and markings.\r\nImmediately after the birth of the puppies, the dog's owner had mother\r\nand young removed from the dark cellar in which they then were, and\r\ncarried to a warm and well-ventilated room in his stables.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness of the cellar one of the puppies was overlooked and left\r\nbehind. As soon as the mother entered the box in which her young had\r\nbeen placed, she proceeded to examine them, nosing them about and\r\nlicking them. Suddenly she appeared to become very much disturbed about\r\nsomething; she jumped out of the box and then jumped back again, nosing\r\nthe puppies as before. Again she jumped from the box and then made her\r\nway toward the cellar, followed by her astonished owner, who had begun\r\nto have an inkling as to what disturbed her. She had counted her young\r\nones, and had discovered that one had been left behind. Sure enough, the\r\nabandoned puppy was soon found and carried in triumph to the new home.\r\n\r\nSo astonished was the gentleman[87] at this blind creature's\r\nintelligence that he resolved to experiment further; he removed another\r\npuppy and walked away with it in his arms. It was not long before the\r\nblind mother showed her distress so plainly, that I begged him to\r\nreturn the puppy, which, having been returned to her, she caressed for a\r\nmoment or so, and then gave herself up to the chief function of\r\nmaternity, suckling her young.\r\n\r\n  [87] Karl Becker, Esq., St. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond reason to suppose that this dog discovered the absence of\r\nher young one through her sense of smell. Granted that to the maternal\r\nnose each puppy had an individual and particular odor (which I do not\r\nbelieve), it is hardly possible, nay, it is impossible, that the dog's\r\nsensorium had recognized and retained these different scents in the\r\nshort time which had elapsed since their birth. It is much more\r\nreasonable to suppose that the dog knew that she had given birth to six\r\nyoung ones, and that she had counted them when they had been removed to\r\ntheir new home. Again, it is a well-known fact that a dog can retain\r\nonly one scent at a time; hence, this fact alone would militate somewhat\r\nagainst the idea that the sense of smell was the detecting agent in this\r\ncase. Nor could it have been the sense of touch; the mother could not\r\nhave possibly familiarized herself with the individual form of each\r\npuppy in so short space of time. It is folly to suppose that each young\r\none had a distinctive taste or flavor; hence the sense of taste must\r\nalso be eliminated. Thus, by exclusion, there remains but one faculty,\r\nthe faculty of computing, to account for the dog's actions.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago there lived in Cincinnati a mule which was employed\r\nby a street railway company in hauling cars up a steep incline. This\r\nanimal was hitched in front of the regular team, and unhitched as soon\r\nas the car arrived at the top of the hill. It made a certain number of\r\ntrips in the forenoon (I have forgotten the number, but will say fifty\r\nfor the sake of convenience), and a like number in the afternoon,\r\nresting for an hour at noon. As soon as the mule completed its fiftieth\r\ntrip, it marched away to its stable without orders from its driver. To\r\nshow that it was not influenced by the sound of factory whistles and\r\nbells, the following remarkable action on the part of this animal is\r\nvouched for by the superintendent of the line, who gave me these data.\r\nOn a certain occasion, during a musical festival, this mule was\r\ntransferred to the night shift, and the very instant it completed its\r\nfiftieth trip it started for the stables. It took the combined efforts\r\nof several men to make it return to its duty. At night there were no\r\nbells or whistles to inform the creature that \"quitting-time\" had come;\r\nit thought the time for rest and food had arrived as soon as it had\r\ncompleted its fifty trips.[88]\r\n\r\n  [88] These data were given to me at a certain club banquet where I had\r\n  no facilities for noting them down. I have endeavored to locate the\r\n  superintendent in question, but without success; I believe, however,\r\n  that he gave the facts just as they occurred.--W.\r\n\r\nMy meals are always served at regular appointed hours, which never vary\r\nthroughout the year; and, since my cook \"prides herself\" on her\r\npunctuality, they are always served on the stroke of the clock. The\r\nmoment the bell rings, my cat, a large and very intelligent male, takes\r\nup a position at the door, and is generally the first to enter the\r\ndining room. A few moments before meal-time, Melchizedek (for he is of\r\nroyal blood and bears a royal name) becomes uneasy, jumping from chair\r\nto floor or from floor to chair, and sometimes mewing gently. The moment\r\nthe bell rings, he is all animation, and shows by his actions that he\r\nfully understands its meaning. He never mistakes the sound of the\r\ndressing-bell for that of the tea-bell, though the same bell is used.\r\nThis cat may not be able to count, but that he notes the passage of time\r\nI do not for an instant doubt.\r\n\r\nSome monkeys give unmistakable evidences of the possession by them of\r\nthe computing faculty. In 1889 I made the acquaintance of a very\r\nintelligent chimpanzee which could count as high as three. That this was\r\nnot a trick suggested by sensual impulses I had ample opportunity of\r\nsatisfying myself. The owner of the animal would leave the room, no one\r\nbeing present but myself, and when I would call for two marbles, or one\r\nmarble, or three marbles, as the case might be, the monkey would gravely\r\nhand over the required number. Romanes mentions an ape that could count\r\nthree, the material used in his experiment being straws from the\r\nanimal's cage.\r\n\r\nThe fact that monkeys can count does not appear so remarkable when it is\r\nagreed by the best authorities that they are capable of understanding\r\nhuman speech.[89]\r\n\r\n  [89] Romanes, _Mental Evolution in Man_, p. 369; Darwin, _Descent of\r\n  Man_, p. 87; Whitney, _Enc. Brit._, \"Philology,\" Vol. XVIII. p. 769,\r\n  quoted by Romanes, _super_.\r\n\r\nReturning for a moment to insects, we find that bees and ants give many\r\nevidences of intelligent correlative ideation and action for definite\r\npurposes not instinctive. In regard to bees, Huber's experiment with the\r\nglass slip proves conclusively, in my opinion, that these creatures\r\n_reason_. This experiment is so interesting that it will bear recital.\r\n\r\nHuber placed a slip of glass in front of a comb that was under\r\nconstruction. The bees, as if perfectly aware of the fact that it would\r\nbe difficult to affix the comb to the slippery surface of the glass,\r\ncurved it at a right angle around the slip of glass and fastened it to\r\nthe wooden wall of the hive![90]\r\n\r\n  [90] Huber, Vol. II. p. 230; quoted also by Kirby and Spence, _loc.\r\n  cit. ante_, p. 582.\r\n\r\nIt is folly to suppose that bees have an instinctive knowledge of glass,\r\nhence we are forced to conclude that they were governed in this instance\r\nsolely by reason.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as the inner surface of the comb was concave, and the outer\r\nsurface convex, the bees made the cells on the former much smaller, and\r\nthose on the latter much larger, than usual!\r\n\r\n\"How, as Huber asks, can we comprehend the mode in which such a crowd of\r\nlaborers, occupied at the same time on the edge of the comb, could agree\r\nto give it the same curvature from one extremity to the other; or how\r\ncould they arrange together to construct on one face cells so small,\r\nwhile on the other they imparted to them such enlarged dimensions?\"[91]\r\n\r\n  [91] Kirby and Spence, _loc. cit. ante_, pp. 582, 583.\r\n\r\nSurely, no \"variation of instinct,\" however complex, can possibly\r\naccount for such a deviation from the normal!\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to give more evidence as to the presence of\r\nreason in the psychical organisms of the lower animals; I believe that I\r\nhave clearly demonstrated that some of them do make use of intelligent\r\nratiocination. To prove that this view, _i.e._ that the lower animals\r\nreason, is widely held, I need only point to the works of such men as\r\nDarwin, Buechner, Forel, Huber, Lubbock, Hartmann, Kirby and Spence, and\r\ndozens of others.[92]\r\n\r\n  [92] Darwin, _Descent of Man_; Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, _Mental\r\n  Evolution in Animals_, _Mental Evolution in Man_; Lubbock, _Senses,\r\n  Instincts, and Intelligence of Animals_, and _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_;\r\n  Hartmann, _Anthropoid Apes_; Buechner, _Geistesleben der Thiere_;\r\n  Huber, _Natural History of Ants_, etc.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the lower animals seem to possess very near, if not\r\nquite, all of the _fundamental_ psychical habitudes of the highest\r\nanimal of all--_Homo sapiens_; we will now proceed to study certain\r\npsychical attributes in the possession of the lower animals which man\r\nhas lost in the process of evolution. These attributes will be embraced\r\nunder the heading of Auxiliary Senses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAUXILIARY SENSES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we come to examine the methods by which, or through which, many of\r\nthe lower animals protect themselves from their enemies, we soon\r\ndiscover that some of these means are very wonderful indeed. It is not\r\nmy purpose to discuss instinctive protective habits in this chapter; I\r\nwish rather to call attention to two _senses_,[93] which are to be\r\nobserved in certain of the lower animals, and which man and some of the\r\nhigher animals have lost in the process of evolution. I refer to\r\ntinctumutation, the \"color-changing\" sense, and the sense of direction,\r\nor, as it is commonly and erroneously termed, the \"homing instinct.\"\r\nNeither of these faculties is instinctive, but they are, on the\r\ncontrary, true senses, just as hearing, or taste, or smell is a sense.\r\nCareful dissections and repeated experiments have shown me, beyond\r\nperadventure, that these two psychical habitudes have their centres in\r\nthe brains (ganglia) of animals which possess them.\r\n\r\n  [93] I believe that I am the first to claim the _sensual_ importance\r\n  of tinctumutation and the sense of direction or the \"homing sense.\"\r\n  Heretofore they have been regarded, by all authorities as far as I\r\n  know, as instinctive in character.--W.\r\n\r\nThe chromatic function--and I use this term to designate the faculty of\r\nchanging color according to surroundings--is possessed by a number of\r\nthe lower animals. The chameleon is the best known of all the\r\ntinctumutants (_tinctus_, color, and _mutare_, to change), though many\r\nother animals possess this faculty in a very marked degree. In order to\r\nunderstand the manner in which these changes or modifications of color\r\ntake place, one must know the anatomy of the skin, in which structure\r\nthese phenomena have their origin. The frog is a tinctumutant, and a\r\nmicroscopic study of its skin will clearly demonstrate the structural\r\nand physiological changes that take place in the act of tinctumutation.\r\nThe skin of a frog consists of two distinct layers. The epidermis or\r\nsuperficial layer is composed of pavement epithelium and cylindrical\r\ncells. The lower layer, or _cutis_, is made up of fibrous tissue,\r\nnerves, blood-vessels, and cavities containing glands and cell elements.\r\nThe glands contain coloring matter, and the changes of color in the\r\nfrog's skin are due to the distribution of these pigment-cells, and the\r\npower they have of shrinking or contracting under nerve irritation. The\r\npigment varies in individuals and in different parts of the body. Brown,\r\nblack, yellow, green, and red are the colors most frequently observed.\r\nThe color-cells are technically known as _chromatophores_. If the web\r\nof a frog's foot be placed on the stage of a microscope and examined\r\nwith an achromatic lens, the chromatophores can readily be made out.\r\nArtificial irritation will immediately occasion them to contract, or, as\r\nis frequently the case, when contracted, will occasion them to dilate,\r\nand the phenomena of tinctumutation may be observed _in facto_. Under\r\nirritation the orange-colored chromatophores, when shrunk, become brown,\r\nand the contracted yellow ones, when dilated, become greenish yellow.\r\nWhen all the chromatophores are dilated, a dark color will predominate;\r\nwhen they are contracted, the skin becomes lighter in color. Besides the\r\npigment-cells just described, Heincke discovered another kind of\r\nchromatophore, which was filled with iridescent crystals. They were only\r\nvisible, as spots of metallic lustre, when the cells were in a state of\r\ncontraction. He observed these latter chromatophores in a fish belonging\r\nto _Gobius_, the classical name of which is _Gobius ruthensparri_.[94] I\r\nhave seen this kind of color-cell in the skin of the gilt catfish, which\r\nbelongs to a family akin to _Gobius_. The skin of this fish retains its\r\nvitality for some time after its removal from the body of the living\r\nanimal, and the chromatophores will respond to artificial irritation for\r\nquite a while. In making my observations, however, I prefer to dissect\r\nup the skin and leave it attached to the body of the fish by a broad\r\nbase. A few minims of chloroform injected hypodermatically rendered the\r\nanimal anaesthetic, and I could then proceed at my leisure, without being\r\ninconvenienced by its movements. The causation of tinctumutation is now\r\ndefinitely known. The theory that light acts directly on the\r\nchromatophoric cells has been proved to be incorrect. Even the theory\r\nthat light occasions pigmentation is no longer tenable. I have, time and\r\nagain, reared tadpoles from the eggs in total darkness, yet they differ\r\nin no respect from those reared in full daylight. The chromatophores\r\nwere as abundant and responded to irritation as promptly in the one as\r\nin the other. The distinguished Paul Bert declared that the young of the\r\naxolotl could not form pigment when reared in a yellow light. Professor\r\nSemper, on the contrary, declares Bert's axolotls to be albinos, and\r\nstates that albinism is by no means infrequent in the axolotl; also that\r\nProfessor Koelliker, of Wuertzburg, reared a family of white axolotls in a\r\nlaboratory where there was an abundance of light, and that he (Semper)\r\nnever succeeded in rearing an albino, though there was less light in his\r\nlaboratory than in that of Koelliker, and his axolotls came from the same\r\nstock. Bert made the mistake of confounding albinism with the phenomenon\r\nof etiolation in plants; in fact, he gives the name \"etiolation\" to the\r\nalbinism noticed in his axolotls.[95]\r\n\r\n  [94] Semper, _Animal Life_, p. 93.\r\n\r\n  [95] _Ibid._, p. 88 _et seq._\r\n\r\nThere is a marked difference between the functions of the chlorophyll\r\nbodies found in plants and the chromatophores found in animals. The\r\nformer play one of the most important roles in the drama of plant life,\r\ninasmuch as they subserve a vital function, while the latter act a minor\r\npart, because they serve only as an instrument or means of protection.\r\n\r\nLight is of great importance in its influence on chlorophyll, which is a\r\nmicroscopic, elementary body on which the vital strength of the plant\r\ndepends, while it is not at all necessary to the chromatophores,--cell\r\nbodies secreting pigmentary matter for the purpose of protection. Of\r\ncourse, when animals are subjected to darkness for very long periods of\r\ntime, the chromatophores are modified, and, sometimes, are wholly\r\nobliterated. They follow a well-known natural law, which declares that,\r\nwhen a function of an organ is no longer of any use to an animal, both\r\norgan and function become rudimentary, and finally disappear.\r\n\r\nMany animals live for generations in total darkness before losing their\r\npigment. I, myself, have seen black beetles in Mammoth Cave, Kentucky,\r\nin the neighborhood of Gorin's Dome, which is far within the depths of\r\nthe cave. As beetles rarely range over a hundred yards from their place\r\nof birth, these insects must have been born in the cave and reared in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of light, if not otherwise specified, I mean diffused\r\ndaylight which carries no heat rays. I believe that heat is a prominent\r\nfactor in the production of color; the discussion of this point,\r\nhowever, does not properly belong to the subject under consideration.\r\n\r\nSome experiments on newts, made by myself several years ago, show that\r\nthe absence of light does not influence pigmentation,--that is, through\r\nseveral generations. My animals were kept under observation from the\r\nextrusion of the eggs until full maturity had been reached, and great\r\ncare was taken to make experiments as accurate and as conclusive as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThose reared in total darkness or in a red light were always\r\ndark-colored; those reared in a yellow light[96] were almost but not\r\nquite as dark; while those reared in white ironstone crocks and in\r\ndiffused daylight were very much lighter, being pearl-gray in color.\r\nThis apparent (for the microscope showed that it was only apparent)\r\nabsence of color in the last-mentioned specimens was due to\r\ntinctumutation.\r\n\r\n  [96] Vide Dewar, \"The Physiological Action of Light,\" _Nature_, p.\r\n  433, 1877; quoted also by Semper, _loc. cit. ante_, Notes, p. 423. I\r\n  do not think that the absence of the slight amount of color in the\r\n  animals reared under the yellow light was due to the \"optic current\"\r\n  of Dewar. The microscope showed that the chromatophores were just as\r\n  large and just as numerous, and that they contained as much pigment,\r\n  as those reared under the red light. The apparent absence of color was\r\n  due to tinctumutation.--W.\r\n\r\nIn most viviparous animals the embryo is developed in almost or absolutely\r\ntotal darkness, yet when it is born it has bright colors. Kerbert has\r\nfound in the cutis of the embryonic chick, about the fifteenth day,\r\ncertain pigment-cells. These cells have entirely disappeared by the\r\ntwenty-third day. It is probable that little, if any, light can reach the\r\nchick through the shell and membranes, yet pigment-cells develop and\r\ndisappear again.[97]\r\n\r\n  [97] Karl Semper, _Animal Life_, p. 422.\r\n\r\nA butterfly emerges from the cocoon arrayed in all the colors of the\r\nrainbow; yet it was developed, while in the _pupa_ state, in total\r\ndarkness. It is not necessary to mention further instances; we readily see\r\nthat pigmentation in animals is not necessarily dependent on light.\r\nNeither is tinctumutation the result of the direct influence of light on\r\nthe chromatophores. Light, however, if not the direct, is the indirect\r\ncause of this phenomenon. Lister, in 1858, showed that animals with\r\nimperfect eyesight were not good tinctumutants, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat they had the chromatophoric function. He showed, by his experiments\r\non frogs, that the activity of the chromatophores depended entirely on the\r\nhealthy condition of the eyes,--that is, so far as the phenomenon of\r\ntinctumutation was concerned. So long as the eyes remained intact and\r\nconnected with the brain by the optic nerve, the light reflected from the\r\nsurrounding objects exerted a powerful influence on the chromatophores.\r\nAs soon as the optic nerve was severed, the chromatophores ceased to\r\nrespond to the influence of light and color, no matter how bright and\r\nvaried they were. The deductions drawn from these experiments are not to\r\nbe controverted or denied. The chromatophores are influenced by light\r\nreflected from objects and transmitted _via_ the optic nerve to the brain;\r\nfrom this organ the impression or irritation goes to the nerve governing\r\nthe contractile fibres of these pigment-holding glands.[98]\r\n\r\n  [98] Karl Semper, _Animal Life_, p. 95.\r\n\r\nPouchet followed Lister, and confirmed his conclusion by experiments on\r\nfishes and crabs. He remarked that the plaice--a fish with a white\r\nunder-surface and a party-colored back--had the chromatophoric function\r\nhighly developed. Among a number of specimens which appeared pale on the\r\nwhite, sandy bottom, he met \"one single dark-colored fish, in which, of\r\ncourse, the chromatophores must have been in a state of relaxation; and\r\nthis specimen was as distinct from its companions as from the bottom of\r\nthe aquarium. Closer investigation proved that the creature was totally\r\nblind,[99] and thus incapable of assuming the color of the objects\r\naround it, the eyes being unable to act as a medium of communication\r\nbetween them and the chromatophores of the skin.\"[100] Thus far Pouchet\r\nhad only confirmed Lister's observations, although it is highly probable\r\nthat he was unaware of Lister's experiments. But he went a step further.\r\nThere are two ways in which cerebral impressions may be transmitted from\r\nthe brain to the skin: one, by way of the spinal cord and the pairs of\r\nnerves arising from it and known as spinal nerves; the other, by two\r\nnerves running close to the vertebral column--the sympathetic nerves.\r\n\r\n  [99] Mr. Gordon Rett has recently called my attention to a blind\r\n  \"angel fish\" which shows, most conspicuously, a lack of\r\n  tinctumutation. This fish was made blind for experimental\r\n  purposes.--W.\r\n\r\n  [100] Karl Semper, _Animal Life_, pp. 95, 96.\r\n\r\nPouchet cut the spinal cord close to the brain, yet the chromatophores\r\nstill responded to light impression, showing that they did not receive\r\nthe message through the cord and spinal nerves. He then divided the\r\nsympathetic nerves, and the chromatophores lost at once the power of\r\ncontraction; he thus demonstrated that the sympathetic nerves were the\r\ntransmitters of the optical message, and not the cord.\r\n\r\nThis discovery of Pouchet is, psychologically, of great importance,\r\nthough he failed to recognize it as such. He was satisfied with its\r\nanatomical and physiological significance.\r\n\r\nWhen we remember that the actions of the sympathetic nerves are almost,\r\nif not entirely, reflex in character, we at once see the psychological\r\nimportance of this discovery. This fact makes the phenomenon of\r\ntinctumutation an involuntary act on the part of the animal possessing\r\nthe chromatic function, and thus keeps inviolate the fundamental laws of\r\nevolution, which, were the facts otherwise, would be broken.[101]\r\n\r\n  [101] This simple fact of involuntary action renders the sensual\r\n  nature of the function all the more apparent.--W.\r\n\r\nBy a series of experiments on frogs I have confirmed the conclusion of\r\nPouchet _in toto_, and have even solved, so I believe and unhesitatingly\r\nassert, the puzzling problem of the physiological _modus operandi_ of\r\nthe wonderful phenomenon of tinctumutation.\r\n\r\nFor a very long time I believed that this function was a distinct sense,\r\nand, five years ago, I set to work in search of the sense's centre.\r\nAfter many dissections I found it (in the frog) lying immediately below\r\nthe optic centres and closely connected with them. Nerve-fibres of the\r\nsympathetic can easily be traced and can be seen to penetrate this\r\ncentre. When this centre is artificially stimulated either with the\r\npoint of a needle or with a mild electric current, tinctumutation can be\r\nincited at will.\r\n\r\nAgain, when this centre is destroyed (which can be done without injury\r\nto the optic centres), the chromatophoric function ceases--the\r\nphenomenon of tinctumutation is no longer observable.\r\n\r\nThat the sympathetic nerves are the carriers of the messages from the\r\noptic nerve and the color-changing centre, can be demonstrated by other\r\nmeans than by excision of the nerve. Atropine, to a certain extent,\r\nparalyzes the sympathetic when given in sufficiently large doses, and\r\ninjections of this drug beneath the skin of a frog render the division\r\nof the sympathetic unnecessary. The chromatophores will not respond to\r\nlight impressions if the animal be placed thoroughly under the influence\r\nof atropine.\r\n\r\nA large number of the lower animals possess the chromatophoric function.\r\nSeveral years ago, I placed in a large cistern several specimens of gilt\r\ncatfish. This is a pond fish and is quite abundant throughout the middle\r\nUnited States. It is of a beautiful golden yellow color on the belly and\r\nsides, shading into a lustrous greenish yellow on the back and head.\r\n\r\nSeveral months after these fish had been placed in the cistern, it\r\nbecame necessary to clean the latter, and the fish were taken out. They\r\nwere of a dusky drab color when first taken out, but soon regained their\r\nvivid tints when placed in a white vessel containing clear water. They\r\nhad evidently changed color in order to harmonize with the black walls\r\nand bottom of the cistern.\r\n\r\nCertain katydids are marked tinctumutants. I took one from the dark\r\nfoliage of an elm and placed her on the lighter-colored leaves of a\r\nlocust. She could be easily seen when first placed on the locust; in a\r\nfew moments, however, she had faded to such an extent that she was\r\nbarely noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of certain moths, beetles, and butterflies also possess the\r\nchromatophoric function. The chromatophores in the larva of _Vanessa_\r\nare very numerous, and this grub is a remarkably successful\r\ntinctumutant; the same can be said of the larvae of certain varieties of\r\n_Pieris_.\r\n\r\nThe power of changing color so as to resemble, in coloring, surrounding\r\nobjects is evidently one of Nature's weapons of defence. In some animals\r\nit is developed in a wonderful manner. Wherever it is found it becomes\r\nto the animal possessing it a powerful means of defence by rendering it\r\ninconspicuous, and in some instances wholly unnoticeable.\r\n\r\nAfter nine years of careful, systematic, and painstaking investigation,\r\nI am prepared to affirm that, besides the senses, sight, smell, taste,\r\ntouch, hearing, and tinctumutation, certain animals have yet another\r\nsense, the sense of locality, or of direction, commonly called the\r\n\"homing instinct.\" This remarkable function of the mind is not an\r\ninstinct any more than the sense of sight or smell is an instinct, but\r\nis, on the contrary, a true sense; for I have demonstrated by actual\r\nexperiment that it has a centre in the brains (ganglia) of some of the\r\nanimals possessing it, just as the other senses have their centres. And,\r\nsince this centre has been found in certain species, and that, too, in\r\ncreatures very low in the scale of animal life, it is reasonable to\r\ninfer that it is present in the brains (ganglia) of all those animals\r\nwhich evince the so-called \"homing instinct.\"\r\n\r\nIn the process of civilization certain of the five senses in man become\r\ndull and blunted; thus, the sense of smell in the Tagals of the\r\nPhilippine Islands is much more acute than it is in the civilized\r\nEuropean, and what is true of the sense of smell is also true of the\r\nother senses, save that of touch, in all primitive peoples. This last\r\nsense seems to be much more acute in civilized man than it is in\r\nsavages. This, for certain psychical reasons, unnecessary to detail\r\nhere, is a necessary result of evolutionary growth and development.[102]\r\n\r\n  [102] Compare Tyler, _Anthropology_; De Quatrefages, _The Human\r\n  Species_; Peschel, _The Races of Man_; Lombroso, _L'Uomo Delinquente_;\r\n  Ellis, _The Criminal_; the writer, \"Criminal Anthropology,\" _N. Y.\r\n  Medical Record_, January 13, 1894.\r\n\r\nAs far as I have been able to learn, after much research in natural\r\nhistory, the anthropoid apes do not show that they possess the sense of\r\ndirection in a marked degree; thus we see that the immediate ancestors\r\nof pithecoid man had already begun to lose this sense, which in man is\r\nentirely wanting, and the absence of which should not be a matter of\r\nsurprise in the slightest degree, but rather a result that should be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nEvidences of this sense are to be observed in animals of exceedingly low\r\norganization. On one occasion, while studying a water-louse, as I have\r\nalready described elsewhere in this book, I saw the little creature swim\r\nto a hydra, pluck off one of its buds, then swim a short distance away\r\nand take shelter behind a small bit of mud, where it proceeded to devour\r\nits tender morsel. In a short while, much to my surprise, the louse\r\nagain swam to the hydra, again procured a bud, and again swam back to\r\nits hiding-place. This occurred three times during the hour I had it\r\nunder observation. The louse probably discovered the hydra the first\r\ntime by accident; but when it swam back to the source of its food-supply\r\nthe second time and then returned again to its sheltering bit of mud, it\r\nclearly evinced conscious memory of route and a sense of direction.\r\n\r\nThe common garden-snail is a homing animal, and it will always return to\r\na particular spot after it has made an excursion in search of food. In\r\nfront of my dwelling there is a brick wall capped by a stone coping; the\r\noverhanging edge of this coping forms a moist, cool home in summer for\r\nhundreds of snails. Last summer I took six of these creatures, and,\r\nafter marking their shells with a paint of gum arabic and zinc oxide, I\r\nset them free on the lawn some distance away from the wall. In course of\r\ntime, four of them returned to their homes beneath the stone coping; the\r\nother two were probably killed and eaten by blackbirds, numbers of which\r\nI noticed during the day feeding on the sward.\r\n\r\nThe centre of the sense of direction in snails is located at the base of\r\nthe cephalic ganglion (brain); this ganglion lies immediately between\r\nand below the \"horns\" (eye-stalks), and is composed of several\r\ncircumscribed and well-marked accumulations or corpuscles of nerve-cells\r\nand nerve-filaments.\r\n\r\nThis sense centre can easily be destroyed without inflicting injury on\r\nthe circumjacent sense centres. Whenever this is done, the snail loses\r\nits sense of direction and locality, and cannot find its way back to its\r\nhome when it is carried thence, and deposited amid new surroundings. It\r\nis not killed by the mutilation, for I have seen marked snails in which\r\nthis sense centre had been destroyed, alive and apparently in good\r\nhealth, several weeks after having undergone this operation; they found\r\ntemporary homes wherever they chanced to be.\r\n\r\nThe limpet is likewise a homing animal, and invariably returns to its\r\nhome after journeys in search of food. Lieutenant L----, an officer in\r\nthe British navy, once told me that he had repeatedly had specimens of\r\nthis animal under observation for months at a time, and that they always\r\nhad particular spots, generally depressions in rocks, which they\r\nregarded as homes, to which they would always return after excursions in\r\nsearch of sustenance. Romanes makes a similar statement.[103]\r\n\r\n  [103] _Animal Intelligence_, pp. 28, 29.\r\n\r\nSome beetles have their homing sense highly developed; thus, in Mammoth\r\nCave, the blind beetle (_Adelops_) has its particular home, and will\r\nalways return to it even when it is set free at a considerable distance.\r\nNotwithstanding the fact these insects are blind, and that darkness\r\nreigns in this immense cavern, they have periods of rest corresponding\r\nwith the diurnal rest-periods of kindred species living in daylight;\r\nhence, it is easy to study their habits at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nI have frequently marked these beetles and then set them free some\r\ndistance away from their domiciles; they would hide themselves at once\r\nbeneath stones or clods of earth, but as soon as they had recovered from\r\ntheir fright they would turn towards home, and would not stop, if left\r\nunmolested, until they arrived at their particular and individual homing\r\nplaces. Truly a most wonderful exhibition of the homing sense!\r\n\r\nAt first, these beetles are, probably, directed and governed by their\r\nsense of direction alone, but as soon as they arrive among familiar\r\nsurroundings, memory comes to their aid.\r\n\r\nThe agile flea is another \"homesteader,\" and if marked, its favorite\r\nresting-place on a dog or cat can easily be determined. After feeding,\r\nit will invariably return to a certain spot in order to enjoy its nap in\r\npeace; for, strange as it may seem, fleas are sound sleepers, and, what\r\nis more, seem to require a great deal of sleep.[104]\r\n\r\n  [104] All insects have periods of rest, during which they seem to be\r\n  in a state of slumber. Their sleep may not be the physiological\r\n  slumber of mammals, yet it effects a like purpose in all\r\n  probability.--W.\r\n\r\nAnts are, of the entire insect world, probably the most gifted\r\nhome-finders. Time and again have I tested them in this, sometimes\r\ntaking them what must have been, to these little creatures, enormous\r\ndistances from their nests before freeing them. Of course the ants\r\nexperimented with were marked, otherwise I could not have watched them\r\nsuccessfully. When an ant is taken into new surroundings and set free,\r\nit at first runs here and there and everywhere. As soon, however, as it\r\nregains its equanimity and recovers from its fright, it turns toward\r\nhome. At first it proceeds slowly, every now and then climbing tall\r\nblades of grass, and from these high places viewing the surrounding\r\ncountry in search of landmarks. As soon as it arrives among scenes\r\npartially familiar to it, it ceases to climb grass-blades or weeds, and\r\naccelerates its pace. When it arrives among well-known and accustomed\r\nsurroundings it runs along at its utmost speed, and fairly races into\r\nits nest.\r\n\r\nThe burying beetle has a regular abode, to which it invariably returns\r\nafter performing the offices of mortician to some defunct bird, beast,\r\nor reptile. This insect grave-digger, by the way, is remarkably expert\r\nat its business, and will bury a frog or a bird in a very short time.\r\nAs soon as it has buried the dead animal and deposited its eggs, it\r\nreturns to its domicile beneath some log or stone.\r\n\r\nSome snakes likewise are exceedingly domestic, and have their regular\r\ndens, to which they resort on occasions. The homing sense seems to be\r\nrather highly developed in them, for they can find their way back to\r\ntheir dens from great distances. I have had under observation for the\r\npast three years a garden snake, locally known as a \"spreading viper\";\r\nthis snake was brought to me by a friend[105] when it was only a foot\r\nlong, so I have known her (for it is a female) ever since her infancy.\r\nOwing to some antenatal accident, this reptile has a malformed head, so\r\nthat I can readily recognize her at a distance of fifteen, twenty, or\r\neven thirty feet. Last year she reared her first brood of young, which I\r\nwas fortunate enough to see with her on several occasions. Her den is on\r\nmy lawn; and in the autumn of last year she conducted her brood to it,\r\nwhere they hibernated until spring. If I remember correctly, on the 29th\r\nof March she came out of her den accompanied by a dozen of her progeny,\r\nall but four (two pairs) of which I killed.[106] Snakes subserve a very\r\nuseful purpose in the economy of nature, but it is well to keep them in\r\nlimits, for, when very numerous, they become dangerous to young birds,\r\nespecially after they have passed the second year.\r\n\r\n  [105] Silas Rosenfield, Esq., Owensboro, Kentucky.\r\n\r\n  [106] The above was written in the summer of 1897. This interesting\r\n  specimen was killed by a day-laborer who had been temporarily employed\r\n  to assist the gardener. An autopsy revealed a bony tumor of the right\r\n  orbital arch, which, from a little distance, looked like a horn.--W.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the anthropoid apes all mammals possess the homing\r\nsense in a higher or lower degree; this is true also of birds.\r\nExperiments with the nesting robin show conclusively that this bird can\r\nfind its way back to its nest when carried fifty miles from its home and\r\nthen set free among wholly unknown surroundings. The well-known exploits\r\nof the carrier-pigeon are so familiar that they scarcely need comment.\r\nOn May 3, 1898, two carrier-pigeons, en route for Louisville, rested for\r\na time at Owensboro, Kentucky; these birds had been set free at New\r\nOrleans, Louisiana. The duck and the goose sometimes have this sense\r\nvery highly developed. I once knew a goose to travel back home after\r\nhaving been carried in a covered basket for the distance of eighteen\r\nmiles. A drake and duck have been known to return to their home after\r\nbeing carried a distance of nine miles by railway. Instances of\r\nhome-returning by dogs, cats, horses, etc., are of such common\r\noccurrence that I hardly need call attention to them; the following\r\ninstance is so unique, however, that I will present it:--\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1861, a gentleman of Vincennes, Indiana, visited his\r\nfather at Lebanon, Kentucky; when this gentleman started to return\r\nhome, his father gave him a yoke of young steers, which he drove, _via_\r\nLouisville, Kentucky, to Vincennes.\r\n\r\nShortly after his arrival at this last-mentioned town, the steers made\r\ntheir escape, swam the river at Owensboro, Kentucky, 160 miles below\r\nLouisville, Kentucky, and, in a week or so, were found one morning at\r\nthe gate of their old home at Lebanon. Directed by their homing sense\r\nalone, these animals had made a journey of several hundred miles over\r\na route they had never seen!\r\n\r\nFishermen are aware that certain fish choose localities for\r\nlurking-places, which they will share with no other fish. The black\r\nbass, and brook trout, and sturgeon, and goggle-eye are familiar\r\nexamples of fish which have this habit.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, I performed the following experiment: I took a black\r\nbass from its home near a sunken stump, and, after passing a short piece\r\nof thread through the web of its tail and knotting it, replaced it in\r\nthe river, two miles below its lurking-place. The next day I saw it in\r\nits old home, clearly recognizable by the bit of thread which waved to\r\nand fro in the clear water as the fish gently moved its tail!\r\n\r\nIn an examination of phenomena such as have been discussed in this\r\nchapter, ay, throughout this book, we must lay aside the dogmatic\r\nassertions of our superstitious ancestors, who, to paraphrase Roscoe,\r\n\"when awed by superstition, and subdued by hereditary prejudices, could\r\nnot only assent to the most incredible proposition, but could act in\r\nconsequence of these convictions, with as much energy and perseverance\r\nas if they were the clearest deductions of reason, or the most evident\r\ndictates of truth.\"[107]\r\n\r\n  [107] Roscoe, _Life of Leo X._, p. 3.\r\n\r\nIt will take the human race many, many years to unlearn, and to recover\r\nfrom the effects of the superstitious cult of the shaman, who exists,\r\nnot only among savages, but also in the most highly civilized races of\r\nthe world! Superstition is the antithesis of knowledge; in fact, it is\r\nbut another name for ignorance.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another exceedingly interesting psychical trait to be\r\nnoticed in the lower animals, especially in insects; I refer to the\r\ninstinctive habit, letisimulation (_letum_, death, and _simulare_, to\r\nfeign). The word \"instinctive\" must not be used, however, when this\r\nstratagem is to be observed in the higher animals other than the\r\nopossum; for many of these animals sometimes make an occasional and a\r\n_rational_ use of it, as I will endeavor to show in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLETISIMULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feigning of death by certain animals for the purpose of deceiving\r\ntheir enemies, and thus securing immunity, is one of the greatest of the\r\nmany evidences of intelligent action on their part.[108] Letisimulation\r\n(from _letum_, death, and _simulare_, to feign) is not confined to any\r\nparticular family, order, or species of animals, but exists in many,\r\nfrom the very lowest to the highest. The habit of feigning death has\r\nintroduced a figure of speech in the English language, and has done much\r\nto magnify and perpetuate the fame of the only marsupial found outside\r\nof Australasia and the Malayan Archipelago. \"Playing 'possum\" is now a\r\nsynonym for certain kinds of deception. Man himself has known this to be\r\nan efficacious stratagem on many occasions. I have only to recall the\r\nnumerous instances related by hunters who have feigned death, and have\r\nthen been abandoned by the animals attacking them. I have seen this\r\nhabit in some of the lowest animals known to science. Some time ago,\r\nwhile examining the inhabitants of a drop of pond water under a\r\nhigh-power lens, I noticed several rhizopods busily feeding on the\r\nminute buds of an alga. These rhizopods suddenly drew in their hair-like\r\ncilia and sank to the bottom, to all appearances dead. I soon discovered\r\nthe cause in the presence of a water-louse, an animal which feeds on\r\nthese animalcules. It likewise sank to the bottom, and, after examining\r\nthe rhizopods, swam away, evidently regarding them as dead and unfit for\r\nfood. The rhizopods remained quiet for several seconds, and then swam to\r\nthe alga and resumed feeding. This was not an accidental occurrence, for\r\nseveral times since I have been fortunate enough to witness the same\r\nwonderful performance. There were other minute animals swimming in the\r\ndrop of water, but the rhizopods fed on unconcernedly until the shark of\r\nthis microscopic sea appeared. They then recognized their danger at\r\nonce, and used the only means in their power to escape. Through the\r\nagency of what sense did these little creatures discover the approach of\r\ntheir enemies? Is it possible that they and other like microscopic\r\nanimals have eyes and ears so exceedingly small that lenses of the very\r\nhighest power cannot make them visible? Or are they possessors of\r\nsenses utterly unknown to and incapable of being appreciated by man?\r\nScience can neither affirm nor deny either of these suppositions. The\r\nfact alone remains that, through some sense, they discovered the\r\npresence of the enemy, and feigned death in order to escape.\r\n\r\n  [108] Instinct does not preclude intelligent ideation. In the lower\r\n  animals death-feigning is undoubtedly instinctive; yet the recognition\r\n  of danger, which sets in motion the phenomena of letisimulation, is\r\n  undoubtedly due, primarily, to intelligent ideation in a vast majority\r\n  of animals. Otherwise this earth would be a lifeless waste.--W.\r\n\r\nThere is a small fresh-water annelid which practises letisimulation when\r\napproached by the giant water-beetle.[109] This annelid, when swimming,\r\nis a slender, graceful little creature, about one-eighth of an inch\r\nlong, and as thick as a human hair; but when a water-beetle draws near,\r\nit stops swimming, relaxes its body, and hangs in the water like a bit\r\nof cotton thread. It has a twofold object in this: in the first place,\r\nit hopes that its enemy will think it a piece of wood fibre, bleached\r\nalga, or other non-edible substance; in the second place, if the beetle\r\nbe not deceived, it will nevertheless consider it dead and unfit for\r\nfood. I do not mean to say that this process of ratiocination really\r\noccurs in the annelid; its intelligence goes no farther, probably, than\r\nconscious determination. In the beetle, however, conscious determination\r\nis merged into intelligent ideation, for its actions in the premises are\r\nself-elective and selective.\r\n\r\n  [109] _Dyticus marginalis._ Vide Furneaux, _Life in Ponds and\r\n  Streams_, p. 325; foot-note for orthography.--W.\r\n\r\nLetisimulation in this animal is by no means infrequent, for I have seen\r\nit feign death repeatedly. Any one may observe this stratagem if he be\r\nprovided with a glass of clear water, a dyticus, and several of these\r\nlittle worms. The annelid is able to distinguish the beetle when it is\r\nseveral inches distant, and the change from an animated worm to a\r\nseemingly lifeless thread is startling in its exceeding rapidity.\r\n\r\nEven an anemone, a creature of very low organization indeed, has\r\nacquired this habit. On one occasion, near St. John's, Newfoundland, I\r\nnoticed a beautiful anemone in a pool of sea-water. I reached down my\r\nhand for it, when, presto! it shrivelled and shrunk like a flash into an\r\nunsightly green lump, and appeared nothing more than a moss-covered\r\nnodule of rock.\r\n\r\nVery many grubs make use of this habit when they imagine themselves in\r\ndanger. For instance, the \"fever worm,\" the larva of one of our common\r\nmoths,--the Isabella tiger-moth,--is a noted death-feigner, and will\r\n\"pretend dead\" on the slightest provocation. Touch this grub with the\r\ntoe of your boot, or with the tip of your finger, or with a stick, and\r\nit will at once curl up, to all appearances absolutely without life.\r\n\r\nA gentleman[110] recently told me that he saw the following example of\r\nletisimulation: One day, while sitting in his front yard, he saw a\r\ncaterpillar crawling on the ground at his feet. The grub crawled too\r\nnear the edge of a little pit in the sandy loam, and fell over,\r\ndragging with it a miniature avalanche of sand. It immediately essayed\r\nto climb up the north side of the pit, and had almost reached the top,\r\nwhen the treacherous soil gave way beneath its feet, and it rolled to\r\nthe bottom. It then tried the west side, and met with a similar mishap.\r\nNot discouraged in the least by its failure, it then tried the east\r\nside, and reached the very edge, when it accidentally disturbed the\r\nequilibrium of a corncob poised upon the margin of the pit, dislodged\r\nit, and fell with it to the bottom. The caterpillar evidently thought\r\nthe cob was an enemy, for it at once rolled itself into a ball and\r\nfeigned death. It remained quiescent for some time, but finally \"came to\r\nlife,\" tried the south side with triumphant success, and went on its way\r\nrejoicing. This little creature evinced conscious determination and a\r\ncertain amount of reason; for it never tried the same side of the pit in\r\nits endeavors to escape, but always essayed a different side from that\r\nwhere it had encountered failure.\r\n\r\n  [110] Mr. George Mattingly, Owensboro, Kentucky.\r\n\r\nMany free-swimming rotifers practise letisimulation when disturbed or\r\nwhen threatened by what they consider impending danger. If a \"pitcher\r\nrotifer\" (_Brachionus urceolaris_) be approached with a needle point, it\r\nwill cease all motion and sink; the same is true of the \"skeleton\r\nrotifer\" (_Dinocharis pocillum_) and numerous others of this large\r\nfamily. Again, if a bit of alga on which there is a colony of \"bell\r\nanimalcules\" (_Vorticellae_) be placed in a live box and then be\r\nexamined with a moderate power, they can be seen to feign death. The\r\nrapidly vibrating cilia which surround the margin of the \"bells\" give\r\nrise to currents in the water which can be easily made out as they sweep\r\nfloating particles toward the creatures' mouths and stomachs. If the\r\ntable on which the microscope rests be rapped with the knuckles, the\r\ncolony will disappear as if by magic. Now, what has become of it? If the\r\nmicroscope be readjusted, a group of tubercles will be observed on the\r\nalga; these are the vorticellae. They have simply coiled themselves upon\r\ntheir slender stems, have drawn in their cilia, and are feigning death.\r\nIn a few seconds one, and then another, will erect its stem; finally,\r\nthe entire colony will \"come to life\" and resume feeding until they are\r\nagain frightened, when they will at once resort to letisimulation.\r\n\r\nDeath-feigners are found in four divisions of animal life; viz., among\r\ninsects, birds, mammals, and reptiles. Indeed, the most gifted\r\nletisimulants in the entire animal kingdom are to be observed in the\r\ngreat snake family. The so-called \"black viper\" of the middle United\r\nStates is the most accomplished death-feigner that I have ever seen; its\r\nmake-believe death struggles, in which it writhes and twists in seeming\r\nagony and finally turns upon its back and assumes _rigor mortis_, cannot\r\nbe surpassed by any actor \"on the boards\" in point of pantomimic\r\nexcellence.\r\n\r\nI do not know of any fish which has acquired this strategic habit, but\r\nthe evidence is not all in, and some day, perhaps, death-feigners may be\r\nfound even among fishes.[111]\r\n\r\n  [111] Letisimulation, apparently, is not confined to animals; we see\r\n  that certain plants have acquired a habit that is strikingly like\r\n  death-feigning. We are apt to regard the plants as being non-sentient,\r\n  yet there is an abundance of evidence in favor of the doctrine that\r\n  vegetable life is, to a certain extent, percipient. Darwin has shown\r\n  conclusively that plant life is as subject to the great law of\r\n  evolution as animal life; he has also demonstrated, in his\r\n  observations of insectivorous plants--the sun-dew (_Drosera\r\n  rotundifolia_) especially--that these plants recognize at once the\r\n  presence of foreign bodies when they are brought in contact with their\r\n  sensitive glands;[A] he has likewise shown that plants, in the\r\n  phenomenon known as circumnutation, evince a percipient sensitiveness\r\n  that is as delicate as it is remarkable.[B] Hence, we need not feel\r\n  surprised when we find, even in a plant, evidences of such a\r\n  widespread stratagem as letisimulation. The champion death-feigner of\r\n  the vegetable kingdom is a South American plant, _Mimosa pudica_. In\r\n  the United States, where in some localities it has been naturalized,\r\n  this plant is known as the \"sensitive plant.\" A wild variety, _Mimosa\r\n  strigilosa_, is native to some of the Southern States, but is by no\r\n  means as sensitive as its South American congener. The last-mentioned\r\n  plant is truly a vegetable wonder. At one moment a bed of soft and\r\n  vivid green, the next a touch from a finger and, in the twinkling of\r\n  an eye, it has changed into an unsightly tangle of seemingly dead and\r\n  withered stems. In this case death-feigning seems absolutely\r\n  successful as far as protection is concerned; for surely no\r\n  grass-eating animal would touch this withered stuff, especially if\r\n  there were other greens in the neighborhood. Death-feigning in plants,\r\n  and kindred phenomena, are not due, however, to conscious\r\n  determination; they are, in all probability, simply the result of\r\n  reflex action.\r\n\r\n    [A] Darwin, _Insectivorous Plants_, Chap. V. _et seq._\r\n\r\n    [B] Darwin, _Power of Movement in Plants_, pp. 107-109.\r\n\r\nRecently, I saw this stratagem perpetrated by a creature so low in the\r\nscale of animal life, and living amid surroundings so free from ordinary\r\ndangers, that, at first, I was loath to credit the evidence of my own\r\nperceptive powers; and it was only after long-continued observation that\r\nI was finally convinced that it was really an instance of\r\nletisimulation.\r\n\r\nThe animal in question was the itch mite (_Sarcoptes hominis_), which is\r\nfrequently met with by physicians in practice, but which is rarely seen,\r\nalthough it is very often felt, by mankind, especially by those\r\nunfortunates who are forced by circumstances to dwell amid squalid and\r\nfilthy surroundings. _Sarcoptes hominis_ is eminently a creature of\r\nfilth, and is primarily a scavenger living on the dead and cast-off\r\nproducts of the skin. It is only when the desire for perpetuating its\r\nrace seizes it that it burrows into the skin, thereby producing the\r\nintolerable itching which has given to it its very appropriate name. It\r\nis only the females that make tunnels in the skin; the males move freely\r\nover the surface of the epidermis. The females make tunnels or\r\n_cuniculi_ in the cuticle, in which they lay their eggs, and they can\r\nreadily be removed from these burrows with a needle. While observing one\r\nof these minute _acarii_ through a pocket lens, as it crawled slowly on\r\nthe surface of the skin, I wished to examine the under surface of its\r\nbody. When I touched it with the point of a needle in attempting to\r\nturn it upon its back, it at once ceased to crawl and drew in its short,\r\nturtle-like legs toward its sides. It remained absolutely without motion\r\nfor several seconds, and then slowly resumed its march. Again I touched\r\nit, and again it came to a halt, and took up its onward march only after\r\nseveral seconds had elapsed. Again and again I performed this experiment\r\nwith like results; finally, the little traveller became thoroughly\r\nchilled, and, after a fruitless endeavor to again penetrate the skin,\r\nceased all motion and died.\r\n\r\nMany of the coleoptera are good letisimulants. The common tumble-bug\r\n(_Canthon laevis_), which may be seen any day in August rolling its ball\r\nof manure, in which are its eggs, to some suitable place of interment,\r\nis a remarkable death-feigner. Touch it, and at once it falls over,\r\napparently dead. It draws in its legs, which become stiff and rigid;\r\neven its antennae are motionless. You may pick it up and examine it\r\nclosely; it will not give the slightest sign of life. Place it on the\r\nground and retire a little from it, and, in a few moments, you will see\r\nit erect one of its antennae and then the other. Its ears are in its\r\nantennae, and it is listening for dangerous sounds. Move your foot or\r\nstamp upon the ground, and back they go, and the beetle again becomes\r\nseemingly moribund.\r\n\r\nThis you may do several times, but the little animal, soon discovering\r\nthat the sounds you make are not indicative of peril to it, scrambles\r\nto its feet and resumes the rolling of its precious ball. The habit of\r\nmaking use of this subterfuge is undoubtedly instinctive in this\r\ncreature; but the line of action governing the use of the stratagem is\r\nevidently suggested by intelligent, correlated ideation.\r\n\r\nSome animals feign death after exhausting all other means of defence.\r\nThe stink-bug (_pentatomid_) or bombardier bug (not the \"bombardier\r\nbeetle\") has, on the sides of its abdomen near its middle coxae (\"hip\r\nbone\"), certain bladder-like glands which secrete an acrid,\r\nfoul-smelling fluid;[112] it has the power of ejecting this fluid at\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n  [112] Comstock, _The Study of Insects_, p. 145.\r\n\r\nWhen approached by an enemy, the stink-bug presents one side to the foe,\r\ncrouching down on the opposite side, thus elevating its battery, and\r\nwaits until its molester is within range; it then fires its broadside at\r\nthe enemy. If the foe is not vanquished (as it commonly is), but still\r\ncontinues the attack, the bombardier turns and fires another broadside\r\nfrom the opposite side. If this second discharge does not prove\r\nefficacious (and I have rarely known it to fail), the little insect\r\ntopples over, draws in its legs, and pretends to be dead.\r\n\r\nMany a man has acted in like manner. He has fought as long as he could;\r\nthen, seeing the odds against him, he has feigned death, hoping that his\r\nantagonist would abandon him and cease his onslaughts. The stink-bug in\r\nthis seems to be governed and directed by _reason_, though the means\r\nused for defence must come under the head of instinct. Many a blind,\r\ninstinctive impulse in the lower animals is, in all probability, aided\r\nand abetted by intelligent ratiocination when once it has made its\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nI have seen ants execute a like stratagem when overcome either by\r\nnumbers or by stronger ants. They curl up their legs, draw down their\r\nantennae, and drop to the ground. They will allow themselves to be pulled\r\nabout by their foes without the slightest resistance, showing no signs\r\nof life whatever. The enemy soon leaves them, whereupon the cunning\r\nlittle creatures take to their feet and hurry away.\r\n\r\nThe most noted and best known letisimulant among mammals is the opossum.\r\nI have seen this animal look as if dead for hours at a time. It can be\r\nthrown down any way, and its body and limbs will remain in the position\r\nassigned to them by gravity. It presents a perfect picture of death. The\r\nhare will act in the same way on occasions. The cat has been seen to\r\nfeign death for the purpose of enticing its prey within grasping\r\ndistance of its paws. In the mountains of East Tennessee (Chilhowee) I\r\nonce saw a hound which would \"play dead\" when attacked by a more\r\npowerful dog than itself. It would fall upon its back, close its eyes,\r\nopen its mouth, and loll out its tongue. Its antagonist would appear\r\nnonplussed at such strange conduct, and would soon leave it alone. Its\r\nmaster[113] declared that it had not been taught the trick by man, but\r\nthat the habit was inherited or learned from its mother, which practised\r\nthe same deception when hard pushed.[114]\r\n\r\n  [113] Mr. George Griffiths, Griffiths' Cove, Chilhowee, Blount County,\r\n  Tennessee.\r\n\r\n  [114] In the case of the cat and dog the use of this stratagem is not\r\n  instinctive; it is the rational use of means to obtain a certain\r\n  desired end. The fact that the dog \"inherited the act\" from its mother\r\n  is not a proof of inherited instinct. Instincts are not formed in a\r\n  single generation.--W.\r\n\r\nMost animals are slain for food by other animals. There is a continual\r\nstruggle for existence. The carnivora and insectivora, with certain\r\nexceptions, prefer freshly killed food. They will not touch tainted meat\r\nwhen they can procure the recently killed, blood-filled bodies of their\r\nprey. The exigencies of their surroundings in their struggle for\r\nexistence, however, often compel them to eat carrion.\r\n\r\nDogs will occasionally eat carrion, but sparingly, and apparently as a\r\nrelish, just as we sometimes eat odoriferous and putrid cheeses, and the\r\nTurks, assafoetida.\r\n\r\nCarnivora and insectivora would much prefer to do their own butchery;\r\nhence, when they come upon their prey apparently dead, they will leave\r\nit alone and go in search of other quarry, unless they are very hungry.\r\n\r\nTainted flesh is a dangerous substance to go into any stomach, unless it\r\nbe that of a buzzard. Heredity and environment have made this bird a\r\ncarrion-eater, hence, like the jackal, the hyena, and the alligator,\r\ncompanion scavengers, it can eat putrid flesh with impunity. Other\r\nflesh-eating animals avoid carrion when they can, for long years of\r\nexperience have taught them that decaying meat contains certain\r\nptomaines which render it very poisonous; hence, they let dead, or\r\nseemingly dead, creatures severely alone. Again, these creatures can see\r\nno object in mutilating an animal which, in their opinion, is already\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion of the means and methods of protection that are to be\r\nobserved in the lower animals, I have brought forward only those in\r\nwhich mind-element was to be discerned. Mimicry and kindred phenomena\r\nhardly have a place in this treatise, for they are, undoubtedly,\r\ngoverned and directed by unconscious mind, a psychical phase which, as I\r\nintimated in the introductory chapter of this book, would be discussed\r\nonly incidentally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nJudging wholly from the evidence, I think that it can be safely asserted\r\nand successfully maintained that mind in the lower animals is the same\r\nin kind as that of man; that, though instinct undoubtedly controls and\r\ndirects many of the psychical and physical manifestations which are to\r\nbe observed in the lower animals, intelligent ratiocination also\r\nperforms an important role in the drama of their lives.[115]\r\n\r\n  [115] Kirby and Spence, _Entomology_, p. 591.\r\n\r\nThe wielders of the instinct club bitterly deny that any of the lower\r\nanimals ever show an intelligent appreciation of new surroundings, that\r\nthey ever evince intelligent ratiocination. They close their eyes even\r\nto the data collected by the chiefs of their tribe, Agassiz, Kirby,\r\nSpence, _et al._, and go on their way shouting hosannas to omniscient,\r\nall-powerful Instinct! When one of the lower animals evinces unusual\r\nintelligence, or gives unmistakable evidences of reason, they account\r\nfor it by saying that \"it is only instinct highly specialized, or, at\r\nleast, a so-called 'intelligent' accident.\"\r\n\r\nSo far from being \"intelligent accidents\" are the ratiocinative acts of\r\nsome of the lower animals (that is, lower than man), that I think that\r\nit can be demonstrated analogically that some of these acts are incited\r\nby one of the highest qualities of the mind--abstraction.\r\n\r\nI do not mean that abstraction which renders the civilized human being\r\nso immeasurably superior to all other animals, but rather that primal,\r\nfundamental abstraction from which the highly specialized function of\r\nman has been developed. The faculty of computing in animals is one\r\nevidence of the presence of this psychical trait in its crude and\r\nundeveloped state. The quality of abstraction in such ideation is not\r\nvery high, it is true, yet it _is_ abstraction, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nMan possesses two kinds of consciousness--an active, vigilant,\r\ncooerdinating consciousness (the seat of which is, probably, in the\r\ncortical portion of the brain) and the passive, pseudo-dormant, and, to\r\na certain extent, incoherent and non-cooerdinating consciousness (the\r\nso-called sub-liminal consciousness) whose seat is in the great ganglia\r\nat the base of the brain (_optic thalami_ and _corpora striata_), and in\r\nother ganglia situated in the spinal cord and elsewhere in the body. My\r\nfox terrier has a brain which, in all essential details, does not differ\r\nfrom that of man, and my observations teach me that his mind is the same\r\nin kind as that of man as far as memory, emotions, and reason are\r\nconcerned; then why deny him the possession of abstraction in some\r\ndegree? I do not mean that abstraction which enables a man to soar into\r\nrealms of thought infinitely above any effort of ideation to be attained\r\nby any of the lower animals, but abstraction in its embryonic state. I\r\nam convinced, by actual experimentation, that this dog falls into \"brown\r\nstudies\" just as man does; may he not then claim one kind of\r\nabstraction, if not another?\r\n\r\nThe elephant, unquestionably, is able to formulate abstract ideas, the\r\nquality of which is very high, indeed. Jenkins wrote to Romanes as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"What I particularly wish to observe is that there are good reasons for\r\nsupposing that elephants possess abstract ideas; for instance, I think\r\nit is impossible to doubt that they acquire through their own experience\r\nnotions of hardness and weight, and the grounds on which I am led to\r\nthink this are as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"A captured elephant after he has been taught his ordinary duty, say\r\nabout three months after he has been taken, is taught to pick up things\r\nfrom the ground and give them to his mahout sitting on his shoulders.\r\nNow the first few months it is dangerous to require him to pick up\r\nanything but soft articles, such as clothes, because things are often\r\nhanded up with considerable force.\r\n\r\n\"After a time, longer with some elephants than others, they appear to\r\ntake in a knowledge of the nature of the things they are required to\r\nlift, and the bundle of clothes will be thrown up sharply as before,\r\nbut heavy things, such as a crowbar or a piece of iron chain, will be\r\nhanded up in a gentle manner; a sharp knife will be picked up by its\r\nhandle and placed on the elephant's head, so that the mahout may take it\r\nby the handle. I have purposely given elephants things to lift which\r\nthey could never have seen before, and they were all handled in such a\r\nmanner as to convince me that they recognized such qualities as\r\nhardness, sharpness, and weight.\"[116]\r\n\r\n  [116] Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, pp. 101, 102; see also Kemp,\r\n  _Indications of Instinct_, pp. 120, 130.\r\n\r\nMr. Conklin, the celebrated elephant trainer, once told me that his\r\nelephants not only recognized such qualities as weight, sharpness, and\r\nhardness, but also _volume or dimension_.\r\n\r\nThe kinship of mind in man and the lower animals is indicated also by\r\nthe phenomenon of dreaming which is to be observed in both. When the\r\nactive consciousness is stilled by slumber, subconsciousness or\r\nganglionic consciousness remains awake, and sometimes makes itself\r\nevident in dreams. I have repeatedly observed my terrier when under\r\ndream influence, and have been able to predicate the substance of his\r\ndreams from his actions. Like man, the dog is sometimes unable to\r\ndifferentiate between his waking and dreaming thoughts; he confounds\r\nthe one with the other, and follows out in his waking state the ideas\r\nsuggested by his dreams.\r\n\r\nThis, with normal man, is always a momentary delusion; with the dog,\r\nhowever, it may last for some little time. Thus, I have seen my dog\r\nchase imaginary rats around my room after having been aroused while in\r\nthe midst of a dream. His chagrin when he \"came to himself\" and saw me\r\nlaughing was always strikingly apparent.\r\n\r\nThe brains of the lower animals are susceptible to the action of drugs,\r\nwhose effects on them are identical with the effects noticed when the\r\nhuman brain is under drug influence. Alcohol, chloroform, ether, opium,\r\nstrychnine, arsenic, all produce characteristic symptoms when they are\r\nintroduced into the circulatory system of the lower animals. Even the\r\nvery lowest animalcules give this evidence as to the kinship of nerve\r\nand ganglionic or brain elements in man and the lower animals.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly noticed the action of alcohol on rhizopods. When small\r\nand almost inappreciable doses were exhibited, the little creatures\r\nbecame lively and swam merrily through the water; but, when large doses\r\nwere given, they soon became stupefied and finally died. I have seen\r\ndrunken jelly-fish rolling and tacking through the alcohol-impregnated\r\nwater for all the world like a company of drunkards.[117] They soon\r\nbecame sober, however, when they were placed in fresh water, but\r\nremained listless and inert for some time afterward.\r\n\r\n  [117] Compare Romanes, _Jelly-Fish, Star-Fish, and Sea-Urchins_, p. 227.\r\n\r\nColeoptera, hymenoptera, diptera, in fact, all insects exhibit the\r\ncharacteristic effects of alcohol when under its influence. Horses,\r\ndogs, cats, monkeys--all mammals are affected characteristically by\r\nalcohol, and it not infrequently happens that they willingly become\r\ndrunkards.[118]\r\n\r\n  [118] Lindsay, _Mind in the Lower Animals_, pp. 81-93.\r\n\r\nAnimals also appear to become cognizant of the fact that certain\r\nsubstances are medicaments, and they will voluntarily search for and\r\ntake such substances when they are ill. Bees are perfectly aware of the\r\nastringent qualities of the sap of certain trees, notably the dogwood\r\nand wild cherry, and, when afflicted with the diarrhoea, can be seen\r\nbiting into, and sucking, the sap from the tender twigs of such trees.\r\nDogs, when constipated, will search for and devour the long, lanceolate\r\nblades of couch-grass (_Triticum repens_); horses and mules, when they\r\nhave \"scours,\" eat clay; cattle with the \"scratches\" have been seen to\r\nplaster hoof and joint with mud, and then stand still until the healing\r\ncoating dried out and became firm; and elephants have been known, time\r\nand again, to plug up shot holes in their bodies with moistened\r\nearth.[119]\r\n\r\n  [119] Romanes, Skinner, Sir R. Tennent, Bingley, Forbes, _et al._\r\n\r\nAgain, the recognition of the rights of property cannot be attributed to\r\ninstinct, neither can it fall under the head of \"intelligent accidents,\"\r\nyet many animals lower than man recognize, to a certain extent, the\r\nrights of property. For instance, in 1879, two very intelligent\r\nchimpanzees were on exhibition at Central Park. One of these animals\r\nclaimed as her property a particular blanket, and, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that there were other blankets in the cage in which they were\r\nconfined, always covered herself with this blanket. She would take it\r\naway from her companion whenever she wished to use it. Again, two\r\nturkeys on my place deposited their eggs in the same nest. The hen which\r\nfirst built and used the nest regarded the spot as her individual home;\r\ntherefore, whenever she found the other hen's egg in the nest, she would\r\nbreak it with her beak, and then carry it some distance away. This I\r\nhave seen her do repeatedly.\r\n\r\nMany dogs, cats, and other animals regard certain rugs, cushions, etc.,\r\nas their own property, and resent any interference with them. It seems\r\nto me that in all such instances these animals regard themselves as\r\nindividuals; that they recognize the psychical as well as the physical\r\ndifference between the _Ego_ and the _Tu_ as soon as they begin to\r\nrecognize the rights of property.\r\n\r\nThose who hold that instinct governs all actions of the lower animals,\r\nusually claim that man is the only tool-user. This is a gross\r\nmistake--elephants, when walking along the road, will break branches\r\nfrom the trees and use them as fly-brushes;[120] these creatures also\r\nmanufacture surgical instruments, and use them in getting rid of certain\r\nparasites;[121] monkeys use rocks and hammers to crack nuts too hard for\r\ntheir teeth; these creatures also make use of missiles to hurl at their\r\nfoes;[122] chimpanzees make drums out of pieces of dry and resonant\r\nwood;[123] the orang-utan breaks branches and fruit from the trees and\r\nhurls them at its foes;[124] the gorilla and chimpanzee use cudgels or\r\nclubs as weapons of offence or defence;[125] monkeys make use of sticks\r\nin order to draw objects within their reach;[126] spiders suspend\r\npebbles from their webs in order to preserve stability,[127] etc.\r\n\r\n  [120] Peal, _Nature_, Vol. XXI. p. 34; quoted also by Romanes.\r\n\r\n  [121] Peal, _Nature_, Vol. XXI.\r\n\r\n  [122] Romanes, _Animal Intelligence_, p. 485 _et seq._\r\n\r\n  [123] Lindsay, _Mind in the Lower Animals_, Vol. I. p. 410.\r\n\r\n  [124] Wallace, _Malayan Archipelago_, p. 41.\r\n\r\n  [125] Lindsay, _loc. cit. ante_, p. 413.\r\n\r\n  [126] Belt, _Naturalist in Nicaragua_, p. 119.\r\n\r\n  [127] Buechner, _Geistesleben der Thiere_, p. 318.\r\n\r\nI could prolong this list to a much greater length, but think it hardly\r\nnecessary. I think that I have demonstrated that man is not the only\r\ntool-user.\r\n\r\nEven such dyed-in-the-wool creationists as Kirby and Spence are forced\r\nto admit the presence of reason in insects.\r\n\r\n\"Such, then, are the exquisiteness, the number, and the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of the instincts of insects. But is instinct the sole guide\r\nof their actions? Are they in every case the blind agent of irresistible\r\nimpulse? These queries, I have already hinted, cannot, in my opinion,\r\nbe replied to in the affirmative; and I now proceed to show that though\r\ninstinct is the chief guide to insects, they are endowed also with no\r\ninconsiderable portion of _reason_.\"[128]\r\n\r\n  [128] Kirby and Spence, _Entomology_, p. 591.\r\n\r\nStudied both objectively and subjectively, insects present indisputable\r\nevidence of reason. Not the higher abstract reason of the human being,\r\nhowever, but reason in its primal, fundamental state.\r\n\r\nThe difference between instinct and reason is not generally understood,\r\nand, as I believe that most readers can comprehend an illustration much\r\nquicker than an explanation, I will use the former in order to bring out\r\nthis difference.\r\n\r\nThe hen which sits three weeks on a china egg is influenced by blind\r\nimpulse--instinct; while the turkey which discovers the eggs of her\r\nrival in her nest, and destroys them, is directed by something\r\ninfinitely higher--by reason. The using of a common nest never occurs\r\namong these birds in a wild state, neither is it of so frequent\r\noccurrence among domesticated turkeys as to have formed an instinctive\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nAgain, the honey-making ants which left their patrol line in order to\r\nslay the wounded centipede may have been, and probably were, influenced\r\nby instinct; another and wholly different psychical trait, however,\r\nimpelled them to fill up the trench dug with my hunting knife. This\r\naccident could not have occurred, perhaps, to them in a state of nature,\r\nor if by any possibility it had ever occurred before, the chances are\r\nthat such occurrences were few in number, and that they happened at long\r\nintervals of time, thus precluding the establishment of an instinctive\r\nhabit. Nor do I think it possible for this action to come under the head\r\nof \"specialized instinct,\" for the same reason. By the very nature of\r\nthings there can be no such thing as an \"intelligent accident\"; the term\r\nis itself a contradiction, therefore the performance of these ants must\r\nbe considered an act of intelligent ratiocination.\r\n\r\nIn this discussion of mind in the lower animals I have endeavored to\r\nshow that the psychical traits evinced by them indicate that their\r\nmental organisms, taken as a whole, are the same in kind as that of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nBates. _The Naturalist on the River Amazon._\r\n\r\nBelt. _The Naturalist in Nicaragua._\r\n\r\nBuechner. _Geistesleben der Thiere._\r\n\r\nCarter. _Annals of Natural History._\r\n\r\nClark. _Mind in Nature._\r\n\r\nComstock. _The Study of Insects._\r\n\r\nDarwin. _The Descent of Man_; _The Origin of Species_; _Insectivorous\r\nPlants_; _Formation of Vegetable Mould_; _The Expression of the\r\nEmotions_; _Power of Movement in Plants_.\r\n\r\nDewar. _Physiological Action of Light_, Nature, 1877.\r\n\r\nFiguier. _Reptiles and Birds._\r\n\r\nFurneaux. _Life in Streams and Ponds._\r\n\r\nGibson. _Sharp Eyes._\r\n\r\nHaeckel. _History of Creation_; _Evolution of Man_.\r\n\r\nHartman. _Anthropoid Apes._\r\n\r\nHickson. _The Fauna of the Deep Sea._\r\n\r\nHuber. _The Natural History of Ants._\r\n\r\nHuxley. _The Study of Zooelogy._\r\n\r\nKemp. _Indication of Instinct._\r\n\r\nKirby and Spence. _Entomology._\r\n\r\nLindsay. _Mind in the Lower Animals in Health_; _Mind in the Lower\r\nAnimals in Disease_.\r\n\r\nLubbock. _Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects_; _Ants, Bees, and Wasps_;\r\n_The Social Hymenoptera_; _The Senses, Instincts, and Intelligence of\r\nAnimals_.\r\n\r\nLuys. _The Brain and its Functions._\r\n\r\nMantagazza. _Physiognomy and Expression._\r\n\r\nMaudsley. _The Physiology of Mind_; _Body and Will_.\r\n\r\nMiller. _Four Handed Folk._\r\n\r\nPeschel. _The Races of Man._\r\n\r\nPettigrew. _Animal Locomotion._\r\n\r\nPeal. _Nature_, Vol. XXI.\r\n\r\nQuatrefages. _The Human Species._\r\n\r\nReclain. _Body and Mind._\r\n\r\nRomanes. _Animal Intelligence_; _Mental Evolution in Animals_; _Mental\r\nEvolution in Man_; _The Jelly-Fish, Star-Fish, and Sea-Urchin_.\r\n\r\nRoscoe. _Life of Leo the Tenth._\r\n\r\nSchmidt. _The Mammalia._\r\n\r\nSchneider. _Thierische Wille._\r\n\r\nSemper. _Animal Life._\r\n\r\nTuke. _Influence of the Mind upon the Body._\r\n\r\nVan Beneden. _Animal Parasites and Messmates._\r\n\r\nWallace. _Island Life_; _The Malay Archipelago_.\r\n\r\nWhitney. _Life and Growth of Language._\r\n\r\nWhite. _A Londoner's Walk to Edinburgh._\r\n\r\nYarrell. _British Fishes._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nACINETA MYSTACINA, amoeba catches and devours an, 50.\r\n\r\nACTINOPHRYS, power of differentiation in A.

Society for the Extension of University Teaching._\r\n\r\n               *       *       *\r\n\r\n16mo. Cloth. $1.00.\r\n\r\n               *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Long experience in the popular exposition of the principles of\r\npolitical economy has given Dr. Edward Thomas Devine peculiar\r\nqualifications for the preparation of a text-book upon this subject, and\r\nhis recently published 'Economics' is an excellent book of its kind. It\r\nmay be warmly recommended.\"--_Dial._\r\n\r\n\"It is a lucid, and entertaining exposition of the subject.\"--_St. Louis\r\nGlobe-Democrat._\r\n\r\n\"Every young man and woman on the verge of the real life that comes with\r\ngaining their majority should read a good work on this subject, and we\r\ncould recommend no better than this particular volume.\"--_Iowa State\r\nRegister._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Devine's will undoubtedly be found a handbook suited to its\r\npurpose.\"--_Milwaukee Sentinel._\r\n\r\n               *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY,\r\n66 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n               *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY\r\n\r\nWITH ESPECIAL REFERENCE TO\r\nTHE FORMATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF\r\nITS PROBLEMS AND CONCEPTIONS.\r\n\r\nBy DR. W. WINDELBAND,\r\n_Professor of Philosophy in the University of Strassburg._\r\n\r\nAuthorized Translation by JAMES H. TUFTS, Ph.D.,\r\n_Associate Professor of Philosophy in the University of Chicago._\r\n\r\n8vo. Cloth. $4.00, net.\r\n\r\n               *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The work commends itself to every student of philosophy.\"--_Boston\r\nTranscript._\r\n\r\n\"As a book of reference it will not supersede Ueberweg's History, but it\r\nis more readable and gives a much better view of the connection of\r\nphilosophic thought from age to age and of the logical relation of the\r\nvarious schools and thinkers to each other. There is no other work\r\navailable in English which presents these aspects of a subject so well,\r\nand both English and American students who do not read German will thank\r\nProfessor Tufts for giving them the book in their own language.\"--_Critic._\r\n\r\n\"No preceding history so fully occupies its field and answers its\r\npurpose. It should have a place in the library of every student of\r\nPhilosophy.\"--_Chicago Tribune._\r\n\r\n\"We believe that this is as nearly perfect a book in the form of a\r\nhistory of philosophy as has ever been produced.\"--_Boston Herald._\r\n\r\n               *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE MACMILLAN COMPANY,\r\n66 FIFTH AVENUE, NEW YORK.",
