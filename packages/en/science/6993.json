THE MODEL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE EXODUS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Calle Las Gabias--one of those by-streets of Lisbon below St.\r\nCatherine--there occurred one New Year a little event in the Synagogue\r\nthere worth a mention in this history of Richard, Lord of the Sea.\r\n\r\nIt was Kol Nidrè, eve of the Day of Atonement, and the little Beth-El,\r\nsweltering in a dingy air, was transacting the long-drawn liturgy, when,\r\nbehind the curtain where the women sat, an old dame who had been gazing\r\nupward smote her palms together, and let slip a little scream: “The Day\r\nis coming...!”\r\n\r\nShe then fainted, and till near ten lay on her bed, lit by the Yom\r\nKippur candle, with open eyes, but without speech, her sere face\r\nstill beautiful, on each temple a little pyramid of plaits, with\r\ngold-and-coral ear-rings: a holy _belle._ About ten P.M. three women\r\nwatching heard her murmur: “My child, Rebekah...!”\r\n\r\nShe was childless, and whom she meant was not known. However, soon\r\nafterwards there was a form at the amulet-guarded door, and Estrella sat\r\nup, saying: “Rebekah, my child...”\r\n\r\nA young lady of twenty-two ran in and embraced her, saying: “I have been\r\nto Paris and Madrid with my father--just arrived, so flew to see you. We\r\nleave for London to-night”.\r\n\r\n“No: I shall keep you seven days. Tell Frankl _I_ say so. What jewels!\r\nYou have grown into a rose of glory, the eyes are profounder and\r\nblacker, and that brow was made for high purpose. Tell me--have you a\r\nlover?”\r\n\r\n“No, mamma Estrella”.\r\n\r\n“Then, why the blush?”\r\n\r\n“It is nothing at all,” Miss Frankl answered: “five years ago when at\r\nschool in Bristol I thrice saw through a grating a young man with whom I\r\nwas frivolous enough to speak. Happily, I do not know what has become of\r\nhim--a wild, divine kind of creature, of whom I am well rid, and never\r\nlikely to see again”.\r\n\r\nThe old lady mused. “What was he?”\r\n\r\n“A sailor”.\r\n\r\n“Not a common sailor?”\r\n\r\n“I fancy so, mamma”.\r\n\r\n“What name?”\r\n\r\n“Hogarth--Richard”.\r\n\r\n“A Jew?”\r\n\r\n“An Englishman!”\r\n\r\nShe laughed, as the old lady's eyes opened in sacred horror, and as she\r\nwhispered: “Child!”\r\n\r\nWithin three months of that night, one midnight the people of Prague\r\nrose and massacred most of the Jewish residents; the next day the flame\r\nbroke out in Buda-Pesth; and within a week had become a revolution.\r\n\r\nOn the twelfth morning one of two men in a City bank said to the other:\r\n“Come, Frankl, you cannot fail a man in this crisis--I only want 80,000\r\non all Westring--”\r\n\r\n“No good to me, my lord,” answered Frankl, who, though a man of only\r\nforty--short, with broad shoulders,--already had his skin divided up\r\nlike a dry leaf; in spite of which, he was handsome, with a nose ruled\r\nstraight and long, a black beard on his breast.\r\n\r\nBut the telephone rattled and Frankl heard these words at the receiver:\r\n“Wire to hand from Wertheimer: Austrian Abgeordneten-haus passed a\r\nResolution at noon virtually expelling Jewish Race....”\r\n\r\nWhen Frankl turned again he had already resolved to possess Westring\r\nVale, and was saying to himself: “Within six months the value of English\r\nland should be--doubled”.\r\n\r\nThe bargain was soon made now: and within one week the foresight of\r\nFrankl began to be justified.\r\n\r\nAustria, during those days, was a nation of vengeful hearts: for the\r\nJews had acquired half its land, and had mortgages on the other half:\r\npeasant, therefore, and nobleman flamed alike. And this fury was\r\ncontagious: now Germany--now France had it--Anti-Semite laws--like\r\nthe old May-Laws--but harsher still; and streaming they came, from\r\nthe Leopoldstadt, from Bukowina, from the Sixteen Provinces, from all\r\nGalicia, from the Nicolas Colonies, from Lisbon, with wandering foot and\r\nweary breast--the Heines, Cohens, Oppenheimers--Sephardim, Aschkenasim.\r\nAnd Dover was the new Elim.\r\n\r\nWith alarm Britain saw them come! but before she could do anything, the\r\nwave had overflowed it; and by the time it was finished there was no\r\ndesire to do anything: for within eight months such a tide of prosperity\r\nwas floating England as has hardly been known in a country.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this was the increased number of hands--each making more\r\nthings than its owner could consume himself, and so making every other\r\nricher.\r\n\r\nThere came, however, a change--almost suddenly--due to the new demand\r\nfor land, the “owners” determining to await still further rises, before\r\nletting. This checked industry: for now people, debarred from the land,\r\nhad only air.\r\n\r\nIn Westring Vale, as everywhere, times were hard. It was now the\r\nproperty of Baruch Frankl: for at the first failure of Lord Westring to\r\nmeet terms, Frankl had struck.\r\n\r\nNow, one of the yeomen of Westring was a certain Richard Hogarth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE FEZ\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankl took up residence at Westring in September, and by November\r\nevery ale-house, market, and hiring in Westring had become a scene of\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe cause was this: Frankl had sent out to his tenants a Circular\r\ncontaining the words:\r\n\r\n“...tenants to use for wear in the Vale a _fez with tassel_ as\r\nthe Livery of the Manor...the will of the Lord of the Manor...no\r\nexception...”\r\n\r\nBut though intense, the excitement was not loud: for want was in many\r\na home; though after three weeks there were still six farmers who\r\nresisted.\r\n\r\nAnd it happened one day that five of these at the Martinmas “Mop,” or\r\nhiring, were discussing the matter, when they spied the sixth boring his\r\nway, and one exclaimed: “Yonder goes Hogarth! Let's hear what _he's_ got\r\nto say!” and set to calling.\r\n\r\nHogarth twisted, and came winning his way, taller than the crowd, with\r\n“What's up? Hullo, Clinton--not a moment to spare to-day--”\r\n\r\n“We were a-talking about that Circular--!” cried one.\r\n\r\nAt that moment two other men joined the group: one a dark-skinned Jew\r\nof the Moghrabîm; the other a young man--an English author--on tour. And\r\nthese two heard what passed.\r\n\r\nHogarth stood suspended, finding no words, till one cried: “Do you mean\r\nto put the cap on?”\r\n\r\nHe laughed a little now. “_I!_ The whip! The whip!”--he showed his\r\nhunting-crop, and was gone.\r\n\r\nHis manner of speech was rapid, and he had a hoarse sort of voice,\r\nalmost as of sore-throat.\r\n\r\nOf the two not farmers, one--the author--enquired as to his name, and\r\nfarm; the other man--the Moghrabîm Jew--that evening recounted to Frankl\r\nthe words which he had heard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, two weeks later, Loveday, the author, was leaning upon\r\na stile, talking to Margaret Hogarth; and he said: “I love you! If you\r\ncould _deign_--”\r\n\r\n“Truth is,” she said, “you are in love with my brother, Dick, and you\r\nthink it is me!”\r\n\r\nShe was a woman of twenty-five, large and buxom, though neat-waisted,\r\nher face beautifully fresh and wholesome, and he of middle-size, with a\r\nlazy ease of carriage, small eyes set far apart, a blue-velvet jacket,\r\nduck trousers very dirty, held up by a belt, a red shirt, an old cloth\r\nhat, a careless carle, greatly famed.\r\n\r\n“But it isn't of your brother, but of _you_, that I am wanting to speak!\r\nTell me--”\r\n\r\n“No--I can't. I am a frivolous old woman to be talking to you about\r\nsuch things at all! But, since it is as you say, wait, perhaps I may be\r\nable--But I must be going now--”\r\n\r\nThere was embarrassment in her now: and suddenly she walked away, going\r\nto meet--another man.\r\n\r\nShe passed through stubble-wheat, disappeared in a pine-wood, and came\r\nout upon the Waveney towing-path. On the towing-path came Frankl to meet\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHe took her hand, holding his head sideward with a cajoling fondness,\r\nwearing the flowing caftan, and a velvet cap which widened out a-top,\r\nwith puckers.\r\n\r\n“Well, sweetheart...” he said.\r\n\r\n“But, you know, I begged you not to use such words to me!”--from her.\r\n\r\n“What, and I who am such a sweetheart of yours?”--his speech very\r\nforeign, yet slangily correct, being, in fact, _all_ slang.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, “you spoke different at first, and that is why--But this\r\nmust be the last, unless you say out clearly now what it is you mean--”\r\n\r\n“Now, you are too hard. You know I am wild in love with you. And so are\r\nyou with me--”\r\n\r\n“_I_?”--with shrinking modesty in her under-looking eyes. “Oh, no--don't\r\nhave any delusions like that about me, please! You said that you liked\r\nme: and as I am in the habit of speaking the truth myself, I thought\r\nthat--perhaps--But my meeting you, to be frank with you, was for the\r\nsake of my brother”.\r\n\r\n“Well, you are as candid as they make them,” he said, eyeing her with\r\nhis mild eye. “But what's the matter with your brother? Hard up?”\r\n\r\n“He's worried about something”. “He must have some harvest-money put\r\naway?”\r\n\r\n“He has something in Reid's Bank at Yarmouth, I believe”.\r\n\r\n“Well, shall I tell you what's the matter with him? He's _afraid_, your\r\nbrother. He has refused to wear the cap, and he thinks that I shall be\r\ndown upon him like a thousand of bricks...But suppose I exempt him, and\r\nyou and I be friends? That's fair”.\r\n\r\n“What _do_ you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Give us _one_--”\r\n\r\n“Believe me, you talk--!”\r\n\r\n“Don't let your angry passions rise. I am going to have a kiss off those\r\nhandsome lips--”\r\n\r\nBefore she could stir he was in the act of the embrace; but it was never\r\naccomplished: for he saw her colour fade, heard crackling twigs, a step!\r\nas someone emerged from the wood ten yards away--Richard.\r\n\r\nThe thought in Margaret's mind was this: “Father in Heaven, whatever\r\nwill he think of me here with this Jew?”\r\n\r\nHogarth stopped, staring at this couple; did not understand: Margaret\r\nshould have been home from “class-meeting”...only, he observed her\r\nheaving bosom; then twisted about and went, his walk rapid, in his hand\r\na hunting-crop, by which, with a very sure aim, he batted away pebbles\r\nfrom his path, stooping each time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE HUNTING-CROP\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong the towing-path to the farmhouse. He did not look behind: was like\r\na man who has received a wound, and wonders whence.\r\n\r\nA pallor lay under his brown skin, brown almost as an Oriental's, and he\r\nwas called “the Black Hogarth”--the Hogarths being Saxon, on the mantel\r\nin the dining-room being a very simple coat--a Bull on Gules. But\r\nRichard was a startling exception. His hair grew away flat and sparse\r\nfrom his round brow; on his cheeks three moles, jet-black in their\r\ncentre. Handsome one called his hairless face: the nose delicate,\r\nthe lips negroid in their thick pout, the left eye red, streaked with\r\nbloodshot, the eyes' brown brightness very beautiful and strange, with\r\na sideward stare wild as that sideward stare of the race-horse; and the\r\nlids had a way of lifting largely anon.\r\n\r\nHe passed through Lagden Dip orchard into the old homestead, into the\r\ndining-room, where cowered the old Hogarth, smoking, his hair a mist of\r\nwool-white.\r\n\r\nHe glanced up, but said nothing; and Richard said nothing, but walked\r\nabout, his arms folded, frowning turbulently, while the twilight\r\ndeepened, and Margaret did not come.\r\n\r\nNow he planted a chair near the old man, sat, and shouted: “Listen,\r\nsir!”\r\n\r\nUp went the old Hogarth's hand to push forward the inquiring ear,\r\nwhile Richard, who, till now, had guarded him from all knowledge of the\r\nCircular, snatched it from his breast-pocket, and loudly read.\r\n\r\nAs the sense entered his head, up the old man shot his palms, shaking\r\nfrom them astonishment and deprecation, with nods; then, with opening\r\narms, and an under-look at Richard: “Well, there is nothing to be said:\r\nthe land is his....”\r\n\r\nHogarth leapt up and walked out; he muttered: “The land is his, but he\r\nis mine....”\r\n\r\nThe question at the bottom of his mind had been this: “Does _Margaret_,\r\ntoo, go with the land?” But he did not utter it even to himself: went\r\nout, fingering the crop, stalking toward the spot where he had left the\r\nman and the woman. But Margaret was then coming through the wood;\r\nFrankl had gone up to the Hall; and Hogarth crossed the bridge and went\r\nclimbing toward the mansion.\r\n\r\nIt was a Friday evening, and up at the Hall the Sabbath had commenced,\r\ntwo Sabbath-tapers shining now upon the Mezuzzah at the dining-room\r\ndoor, Frankl being of the Cohanîm, the priestly class--a Jew of Jews. As\r\nhe had passed in, two Moghrabîm Jews had saluted him with: “Shabbath”;\r\nand mildly he had replied: “Shabbath”.\r\n\r\nBut swift upon his steps strode Hogarth: Hogarth was at the\r\nlodge-gates--was on the drive--was in the hall.\r\n\r\nBut, since Frankl was just preparing to celebrate the _kiddush_, “He\r\ncannot be seen now”, said a man in the hall.\r\n\r\n“He must”, said Hogarth.\r\n\r\nAs he brushed past, two men raised an outcry: but Hogarth continued\r\nhis swift way, and had half traversed a _salon_ hung with a chaos of\r\ncut-glass when from a side-door appeared the inquiring face of Frankl in\r\npious skull-cap.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he cried--“I cannot be seen--”\r\n\r\nHe recognized the man of the towing-path, and on his face grew a look of\r\nscare, as he backed toward a study: but before he could slam the door,\r\nHogarth, too, was within.\r\n\r\n“Who are you? What is it?” whined Frankl, who was both hard master and\r\ncringing slave.\r\n\r\nHogarth produced the Circular: but of Margaret not a word.\r\n\r\n“Caps-and-tassels, you?”--flicking Frankl on the cheek with a fillip of\r\nhis middle finger.\r\n\r\n“You dare assault me! Why, I swear, I meant no harm--”\r\n\r\nDown came the whip upon the Jew's shoulders, Frankl, as the stings\r\npenetrated his caftan, giving out one roar, and the next instant, seeing\r\nthe two Jews at the doorway, groaned the mean whisper: “Oh, don't make a\r\nman look small before the servants”, crying out immediately: “Help!”\r\n\r\nSoon five or six servants were at the door, and, of these, two Arab Jews\r\nrushed forward, one a tall fellow, the other an obese bulk with bright\r\nblack eyes, the former holding a slender blade--the knife with which\r\n“shechita”, or slaughtering, was done: and while the corpulent Jew threw\r\nhimself upon Hogarth, the other drew this knife through the flesh of\r\nHogarth's shoulder, at the same time happening to cut the heavy Arab\r\nacross the wrist.\r\n\r\nNow, there was some quarrel between the two Arabs, and the injured Arab,\r\nforgetting Hogarth, turned fiercely upon his fellow.\r\n\r\nHogarth, meanwhile, had not let go Frankl, nor delivered the intended\r\nnumber of cuts: so he was again standing with uplifted whip, when his\r\neye happened to fall upon the doorway.\r\n\r\nHe saw there a sight which struck his arm paralysed: Rebekah Frankl.\r\n\r\nTwo months had she been here at Westring--and he had not known it!\r\n\r\nThere she stood peering, of a divine beauty in his eyes, like\r\nhalf-mythical queens of Egypt and Babylon, blinking in a rather\r\nbarbarous superfluity of jewels: and, blinded and headlong, he was in\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nAs for Frankl, he locked that door upon himself, and remained there,\r\nforgetting the sanctification of the Sabbath.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew's eyes blazed like a wild beast's. The words: “As the Lord\r\nliveth...” hissed in whispers from his lips.\r\n\r\nHe took up a pinch of old ashes, and cast it into the air.\r\n\r\nAs Shimei, the son of Gera, cursed David, so he cursed Richard Hogarth\r\nthat night--again and again--with grave rites, with cancerous rancour.\r\n\r\n“I will blight him, as the Lord liveth; as the Lord liveth, I will\r\nblight him...” he said repeatedly, his draperied arms spread in pompous\r\nimprecation.\r\n\r\nAs a beginning, he sat and wrote to Reid's Bank, requesting the payment\r\nin gold of £14,000--to produce a stoppage of payment at the little Bank\r\nin which were Richard's savings.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, with mild eyes he repaired to the dining-hall, and\r\nsanctified the Sabbath, blessing a cup of wine, dividing up two napkined\r\nloaves, and giving to Rebekah his benediction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE SWOON\r\n\r\n\r\nHogarth went moodily down the hillside to the Waveney, across the\r\nbridge, and home, his sleeve stained with blood.\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room, he threw himself into an easy-chair in a gloom lit\r\nonly by the fireglow, in the room above mourning a little harmonium\r\nwhich Margaret was playing, mixed with the sound of Loveday's voice.\r\n\r\nThe old man said: “Richard, my boy...”\r\n\r\nHogarth did not answer.\r\n\r\n“Richard, I have somewhat to say to you--are ye hearkening?”\r\n\r\nRichard, losing blood, moaned a drowsy “Yes”.\r\n\r\nAnd the old Hogarth, all deaf and bedimmed, said: “I had to say it to\r\nyou, and this night let it be: Richard, you are no son of mine”.\r\n\r\nAt this point Hogarth's head dropped forward: but many a time, during\r\nlong years, he remembered a dream in which he had heard those words:\r\n“Richard, you are no son of mine...”\r\n\r\nThe old Hogarth continued to ears that did not hear:\r\n\r\n“I have kept it from you--for I'm under a bargain with a firm of\r\nsolicitors in London; but, Dick, it doesn't strike me as I am long for\r\nthis world: a queer feeling I've had in this left side the last hour or\r\ntwo; and there's that Circular--I never heard of such a thing in all my\r\nborn days. But what can we do? You'll have to wear the cap--or be turned\r\nout. Always I've said to myself, from a young man: 'Get hold of a bit of\r\nland someways as your own God's own': but I never did; the days went by\r\nand by, and it all seems no longer than an after-dinner nap in a barn on\r\na hot harvest-day. But a bit of land--the man who has that can make all\r\nthe rest work to keep him. And if they turn me out, I couldn't live,\r\nlad: the old house has got into my bones, somehow. Anyhow, I think the\r\ntime is come to tell you in my own way how the thing was. No son are you\r\nof mine, Richard. Your mother, Rachel, who was a Londoner, served me an\r\nill turn while we were sweethearting, hankering after another man--a Jew\r\nmillionaire he was, she being a governess in his house; but, Richard, I\r\ncouldn't give her up: I married her three months before you were born;\r\nand not a living creature knows, except, perhaps, one--perhaps one: a\r\npriest he was, called O'Hara. But that's how it was. Your father was\r\na Jew, and your mother was a Jew, and you are a Jew, and in the\r\nunder-bottom of the old grey trunk you will find a roll of papers. Are\r\nyou hearkening? And don't you be ashamed of being a Jew, boy--_they_ are\r\nthe people who've got the money; and money buys land, Richard. Nor your\r\nfather did not do so badly by you, either: his name was Spinoza--Sir\r\nSolomon Spinoza--”\r\n\r\nAt that point Margaret, bearing a lamp, entered, followed by Loveday,\r\nand at the sight of Richard uttered a cry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nREID'S\r\n\r\n\r\nBy noon Hogarth knew the news: his hundred and fifty at Reid's were\r\ngone; and he owed for the Michaelmas quarter--twenty-one pounds five,\r\nhis only chattels of value being the thresher, not yet paid for, half a\r\nrick, seed, manure, and “the furniture”. If he could realize enough for\r\nrent, he would lack capital for wages and cultivation, for Reid's had\r\nbeen his credit-bank.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner he stood long at a window, then twisted away, and walked\r\nto Thring, where he captained in a football match, Loveday watching his\r\nrage, his twisting waist, and then accompanying him home: but in the\r\ndining-room they found the lord-of-the-manor's bailiff; and Loveday,\r\ndivining something embarrassing, took himself away.\r\n\r\nThe same evening there were two appraisers in the house, and the\r\nbailiff, on their judgment, took possession of the chattels on the\r\nholding except some furniture, and some agricultural “fixtures”. The\r\nsale was arranged for the sixth day.\r\n\r\nFrom the old Hogarth the truth could no longer be hidden...\r\n\r\nTwo days he continued quiet in the old nook by the hearth, apparently in\r\na kind of dotage doze; but on the third, he began to poke about, hobbled\r\ninto the dairy, peered into the churn, touched the skimmer.\r\n\r\n“You'll have to wear the cap”, Margaret heard him mutter--“or be turned\r\nout”.\r\n\r\nAs if taking farewell, he would get up, as at a sudden thought, to go to\r\nvisit something. He kept murmuring: “I always said, Get a bit of land as\r\nyour own, but I never did; the days went by and by....”\r\n\r\nMargaret, meantime, was busy, binding beds with sheets, making bundles,\r\npreparing for the flitting, with a heaving breast; till, on the fifth\r\nday, a van stood loaded with their things at the hall-door, and she,\r\nwith untidy hair, was helping heave the last trunk upon the backboard,\r\nwhen the carman said: “Mrs. Mackenzie says, mum, the things mustn't be\r\ntook to the cottage, except you pay in advance”.\r\n\r\nNow Margaret stood at a loss; but in a minute went bustling, deciding\r\nto go to Loveday, not without twinges of reluctance: for Loveday, with\r\ninstinctive delicacy, had lately kept from the farm; and to Margaret,\r\nwhose point of view was different, the words “false friends” had\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nPassing through an alley of the forest, she was met by a man--a\r\npark-keeper of Frankl's--a German Jew, who had once handed her a note\r\nfrom Frankl. And he, on seeing her, said: “Here have I a letter for your\r\nbrother”.\r\n\r\n“Who from?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“That may I not say”.\r\n\r\nWhen he handed her an envelope rather stuffed with papers, she went\r\non her flurried way; and soon Loveday was bowing before her in his\r\nsitting-room at Priddlestone.\r\n\r\n“You will be surprised to see me, Mr. Loveday,” said she, panting.\r\n\r\n“A little surprised, but most awfully glad, too. Is all well?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, far from that, I'm afraid. But I haven't got any time--and, oh my,\r\nI don't know how to say it,--but to be frank with you--could you lend\r\nRichard two pounds--?”\r\n\r\nLoveday coloured to the roots of his hair.\r\n\r\nHe could not tell her: “Open that envelope in your hand”, for that would\r\nhave meant that it was he who had sent the £50 it contained; and he had\r\nnow only one sixpence in Priddlestone.\r\n\r\n“That is”, she said--“if it is not an inconvenience to you--”\r\n\r\nHe could find no words. Some fifteen minutes before, having enclosed\r\nthe notes, he had descended to the bar to get mine host to find him a\r\nmessenger, and direct the envelope--for Hogarth knew his handwriting.\r\nMine host was not there--his wife could not write: but she had pointed\r\nout the Jewish park-keeper sipping beer; so Loveday had had the man\r\nupstairs, had made him write the address, and had bribed him to deliver\r\nthe envelope with a mum tongue.\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid I've taken a great liberty--” she said, shrinking at his\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nThen he spoke: “Oh, liberty!--but--really--I'm quite broke myself--!”\r\n\r\n“Then, good-afternoon to you”, said she: “I am very sorry--but you will\r\nexcuse the liberty, won't you--?”\r\n\r\nIn the forest she began to cry, covering her eyes, moaning: “Why, how\r\ncould he be so _mean_? And I who loved that young man with all my heart,\r\nGod knows--!”\r\n\r\nHer eyes searched the ground for two sovereigns. Then she happened to\r\nlook at the envelope: and instantly was interested. “Why, it is the\r\nJew's hand!” she thought, for the letters were angular in the German\r\nmanner, making a general similarity with Frankl's writing.\r\n\r\nCuriosity overcame her: she opened, and saw...\r\n\r\n“Oh, well, this is _generous_ though, after all!” she exclaimed.\r\n\r\nAnd now she ran, coming out from mossy path upon wide forest-road: and\r\nthere, taking promenade, was Frankl, quite near, with phylacteried left\r\narm.\r\n\r\n“Why, sweetheart...” said he.\r\n\r\nShe stopped before him. “Well, you can call me what you like for the\r\ntime being”, said she, laughing rather hysterically; “for I am most\r\ngrateful to you for your generous present to my brother, Mr. Frankl!”\r\n\r\nShe had still no suspicion of Richard's visit of chastisement to the\r\nHall!\r\n\r\n“Now, what do you mean?” said Frankl.\r\n\r\n“Why, you might guess that I know your handwriting by this time!” she\r\nsaid coquettishly, and held out the notes and the envelope.\r\n\r\nHis eyes twinkled; he meditated; he had, more than ever, need of her;\r\nand he said: “Well, you are as 'cute as they make them!”\r\n\r\n“But instead of sending us this, which I am not at all sure that Richard\r\nwill touch, why couldn't you pay it to yourself, and not turn us out--”\r\n\r\n“I let business take its course: and afterwards I do my charity. But it\r\nwasn't for your brother, you know, that I sent it--but for _you_”.\r\n\r\n“I must be running--”\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the farm, she gave the carman a secret glimpse of the\r\nnotes, while Hogarth, who was now there, went to seek the old Hogarth,\r\nfor whom a nest had been made among the furniture in the cart.\r\n\r\nHe was found above-stairs in an empty room, searching the floor for\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n“Come, sir”, said Hogarth, and led him step by step.\r\n\r\nBut as the old man passed the threshold, he fell flat on the slabs of\r\nthe porch, striking his forehead, printing a stain there.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day, the day of the sale, he still lay in the old chamber,\r\non the ancient bed, dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n“PEARSON'S WEEKLY”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Rose Cottage” was without roses: but had a good-sized “garden” at the\r\nback; and here Hogarth soon had a shed nailed together, with bellows,\r\nanvil, sledges, rasps, setts, drifts, and so on, making a little smithy.\r\n\r\nHe engaged a boy; and soon John Loveday would be leaning all a forenoon\r\nat the shed door, watching the lithe ply of Hogarth's hips, and the\r\nwhite-hot iron gushing flushes; while Margaret, peeping, could see\r\nLoveday's slovenly ease of pose, his numberless cigarettes, and hear the\r\nrhymes of the sledges chiming.\r\n\r\nAs to Loveday's £50, she had dared to say nothing to Richard, but kept\r\nthem, intending to make up the amount already spent, and give them to\r\nFrankl. Loveday, meantime, she avoided with constant care.\r\n\r\nSo two weeks passed, till, one day, Loveday, leaning at the forge-door,\r\nhappened to say: “Are you interested in current politics? The East\r\nNorfolk division is being contested, one of the candidates, Sir Bennett\r\nBeaumont, is a friend of mine, and I was thinking that I might go to the\r\nmeeting to-night, if you could come--”\r\n\r\n“I invite you to supper here instead”.\r\n\r\n“Not interested?” queried Loveday.\r\n\r\n“Not at all. Stop--I'll show you something in which I _am_ interested”.\r\n\r\nHe ran to a corner, picked up a _Pearson's Weekly_, and pointed to a\r\nparagraph headed:\r\n\r\n“FIVE HUNDRED-POUND NOTES!\r\n\r\n“FIFTY TEN-POUND NOTES!!\r\n\r\n“ONE HUNDRED FIVE-POUND NOTES!!!” --a prize for “the most intelligent”\r\n article, explaining the cause, or causes, of “the present distress and\r\ncommercial crisis”.\r\n\r\nLoveday read it smiling.\r\n\r\n“Ah”, said he, “but who is to be the judge of 'the most intelligent'\r\narticle? Pearson must himself be of the highest intelligence to decide”.\r\n\r\n“True”, said Hogarth. “But the man who offered that prize has indicated\r\nto the nation the thing which it should be doing. If I was able to form\r\nan Association to enter this competition--and why not? Stop--I will go\r\nwith you--”\r\n\r\nSo that evening they walked to Beccles, and took train for Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nThe candidate to speak was a Mr. Moses Max, a Liberal Jew; the chair to\r\nbe taken by Baruch Frankl; and in the midst of a row, the stately great\r\nmen entered upon the platform and occupied it, hisses like the escape\r\nof steam mixing with “He's a jolly good fellow”. Midway down the pit sat\r\nLoveday, and with him Hogarth, whose large stare ranged solemnly round\r\nand down from galleries to floor.\r\n\r\nFrankl sipped water, and rose, amid shouts of: “Circular!”\r\n “Caps-and-tassels!”\r\n\r\nHe made a speech of which nothing was known, except the amiable bows,\r\nfor a continual noising filled the hall; and up rose Mr. Moses Max, a\r\nstout fair Jew, whose fist struck with a regular, heavy emphasis. After\r\nten minutes, when he began to be heard, he was saying:\r\n\r\n“...Sir Bennett Beaumont! Is _he_ the sort of man you'd send to\r\nrepresent you? (Cries of: “Yes!”) What is he?--ask yourselves the\r\nquestion: a fossilized Tory, a man who's about as much idea of progress\r\nas a mummy--people actually say he's _got_ a collection of mummies in\r\nhis grand fashionable mansion at Aylesham, and it's only what we should\r\nexpect of him. (Cheers, and cries of: “Oh, oh!”) And what has he\r\never done for East Norfolk? Gentlemen, you may say as you like about\r\nJews--Jews this, and Jews that--and every man has a right to his opinion\r\nin this land of glorious Saxon liberty--but no one can deny that it's\r\nJews who know how to make the money. (Cheers and hisses.) They know how\r\nto make it for themselves (hisses)--and, yes, they know how to make it\r\nfor the nation! (Loud triumph of cheers.) _That's_ the point--_that_\r\ntouches the spot! (Cries of: “Oh, oh!”) Righteousness, it is said,\r\nexalteth a nation: well, so do Jews--”\r\n\r\n“That is false”, said a voice--Hogarth, who had stood up.\r\n\r\nThe words were the signal for a shower of cheers swept by gusts of\r\nhisses; and immediately one region of the pit was seen to be a scrimmage\r\nof fisticuffs, mixed with policemen, sticks, savage faces, and bent\r\nbacks; while the two galleries, craning to see, bellowed like Bashan.\r\n\r\nMoses Max was leaning wildly, gesticulating, with shouts; while Loveday,\r\nwho had turned pale on Hogarth's rising, touched Hogarth's coat-tail,\r\nwhereupon Hogarth, stooping to his ear, shouted: “We will have some\r\nfun...”\r\n\r\n“The paid agents of Beaumont!” now shouted Moses Max; “sent to disturb\r\nour meeting! Englishmen! will you submit to this? The nation shall\r\nhear--”\r\n\r\nAt that point Moses Max, in his gesticulation, happening to touch a\r\nswitch in the platform-rail, out glowered into darkness every light\r\nat that end of the hall: at which thing the audience was thrown into a\r\nstate of boisterous lawlessness, a tumult reigning in the gloom like the\r\nconstant voice of Niagara, until suddenly the platform was again lit up,\r\nand the uproar lulled.\r\n\r\nAnd now again Moses Max was prone to speak, with lifted fist; but before\r\never he could utter one single word, a voice was ringing through the\r\nAssembly Rooms:\r\n\r\n“_Where_ was Moses when the light went out?”\r\n\r\nThis again was Hogarth; and it ended Moses Max for that night.\r\n\r\nHogarth had not sat since he had called out “That is false”: his tall\r\nfigure was recognized; and, with that electric spontaneity of crowds, he\r\nwas straightway the leader of the meeting, men darting from their seats\r\nwith waving hats, sticks, arms, and vociferous mouth, the chairman half\r\nstanding, with a shivering finger directed upon Hogarth, shrieking to\r\nthe police: but too late--Hogarth had brushed past Loveday's knees--was\r\ndashing for the crowded platform-steps--was picking his way, stumbling,\r\ndarting up them.\r\n\r\nCrumpled in his hand was a _Pearson's Weekly_.\r\n\r\nNow he is to the front--near Frankl.\r\n\r\n“Friends! I have ventured to take the place of our friend, Moses,\r\nhere--no ill-will to him--for with respect to the question before us,\r\nwhether we elect Beaumont or Max, I care, I confess, little. I'm rather\r\nan Anti-Jew myself (hissing and cheers), but it strikes me that the Jews\r\nare the least of our trouble. To a man who said to me that the cause of\r\nall our evil days is the inability of England to feed these few million\r\nJews I'd answer: “I don't know how you can be so silly!” Why, the whole\r\nhuman race, friends, can find room on the Isle of Wight--the earth\r\nlaughs at the insignificant drawings upon her made by the small infantry\r\ncalled Man. Then, why do we suffer, friends? We _do_ suffer, I suppose?\r\nI was once at Paris, and at a place called 'the Morgue' I saw exposed\r\nyoung men with wounded temples, and girls with dead mouths twisted, and\r\ninnocent old women drowned; and there must be a biggish cry, you know,\r\nrising each night from the universal earth, accusing some hoary fault in\r\nthe way men live together! What is the fault? If you ask _me_, I answer\r\nthat I am only a common smith: _I_ don't know: but I know this about the\r\nfault, that it is something simple, commonplace, yet deep-seated, or we\r\nshould all see it; but it is hidden from us by its very ordinariness,\r\nlike the sun which men seldom look at. It _must_ be so. And shall we\r\nnever find the time to think of it? Or will never some grand man, mighty\r\nas a garrison, owning eyes that know the glances of Truth, arise to see\r\nfor us? Friends! but, lacking him, what shall we do to be saved?--for\r\ntruly this 'civilization' of ours is a blood-washed civilization,\r\nfriends, a reddish Juggernaut, you know, whose wheels cease not: so we\r\nshould be prying into it, provided we be not now too hide-bound: for\r\nthat's the trouble--that our thoughts grow to revolve in stodgy grooves\r\nof use-and-wont, and shun to soar beyond. Look at our Parliament--a\r\nhurdy-gurdy turning out, age after age, a sing-song of pigmy\r\nregulations, accompanied for grum kettledrum by a musketry of suicides,\r\nand for pibroch by a European bleating of little children. We are still\r\na million miles from civilization! For what is a civilized society? It\r\ncan only be one in which the people are proud and happy! The people of\r\nAfrica are happy, not proud; not civilized; the people of England have\r\na certain pride, not a millionth part as superb as it might be, but are\r\nfar from happy: far from civilized. The fact is, Man has never begun to\r\nlive, but still sleeps a deep sleep. Well! let us do our best, we here!\r\nI have here a paper offering a prize to the man of us who will go to the\r\nroot of our troubles, and my idea in usurping the place of our friend,\r\nMr. Max, was to ask you to form an association with me to enter that\r\ncompetition. There is no reason why our association should not be large\r\nas the nation, nor why it should not spread to France and Turkey. For\r\nthe thing presses, and to-morrow more of the slaughtered dead will be\r\nswarming in the mortuaries of London. Will you, then? The understanding\r\nwill be this: that each man who writes his name in a note-book which\r\nwill lie at Rose Cottage, Thring, or who sends his name, will devote\r\nsixty minutes each day to the problem. I happen to be in a position to\r\nuse a chapel at Thring, and there I will hold a meeting--”\r\n\r\nAt this point Frankl rose: Thring was _his_, his own, own, own; and now\r\nhis eyes had in them that catlike blaze which characterized his rages.\r\n\r\n“Here, police! police!” he hissed low, “what's the use of police\r\nthat don't act!” And now he raised his voice to a scream: “Jews! Shew\r\nyourselves! Don't let this man stay here...!”\r\n\r\nAbout twenty Jews leapt at the challenge; at the same time Hogarth,\r\nseeing two policemen running forward from the back, folded his arms, and\r\ncried out: “Friends! I have not finished! Don't let me be removed...”\r\n\r\nWhereupon practically every man in the pit was in motion, for or against\r\nhim, the galleries two oblongs of battle.\r\n\r\nAs up the two curving stairs stormed the mob, by a sudden rush like an\r\nocean-current he was borne off his feet toward the side, and was about\r\nto bring down his sharp-pointed little knuckles, when his eye fell upon\r\nthe face of a lady who had fainted.\r\n\r\nHe had had no idea that she was there!--Rebekah Frankl.\r\n\r\nShe had quietly fainted, not at the rush--but before--during Hogarth's\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nHogarth managed to fight his way to a door at the platform back with\r\nher, entered a room where some chairs were, but, seeing a stair, could\r\nnot let her go from his embrace, but descended, passed along a passage\r\nand out into a patch of green.\r\n\r\nShe, under the dark sky, whispered: “It is you”, her forehead on his\r\nshoulder; and added: “My carriage, I think, is yonder”.\r\n\r\nHogarth saw the carriage-lights at the field's edge, bore her thither,\r\nlaid her with care on the cushions, kissed her hand: and this act Frankl\r\nsaw--with incredulity of his own eyes. As he approached, Hogarth walked\r\naway.\r\n\r\nFrankl mastered his voice to say blandly in Spanish: “Well, how did you\r\nget through, sweet child? Who was that man--? But stay: where are those\r\ntwo fools?”\r\n\r\nThis meant the two familiars--the Arabs, Isaac and Mephibosheth, one of\r\nwhom had come as footman, the other as coachman--and, as he went raging\r\nabout the carriage, with stamps, his boot struck against a body. There\r\nwas enough light to reveal to his peering that it was Mephibosheth, whom\r\nIsaac had stabbed, and fled...\r\n\r\nFrankl lowered his ear--doubted whether he could detect a breathing; and\r\nthough scared, he being a Cohen, and the presence of death defilement,\r\nyet he stayed, bending over Mephi several minutes, thinking, not of him,\r\nbut of Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“It is that fool, Isaac, has done it”, he thought; “and if the man be\r\ndead--” What then? “_If_ he be dead, I've got you, Mr. Hogarth, in the\r\nhollow of this hand....”\r\n\r\nHis fingers passed over the body: there, sticking in the breast, was a\r\ncangiar which Isaac, in his panic, had left, and Frankl's hand rested on\r\nthe handle; if he did not consciously press the knife home, very heavily\r\nhis hand rested on it, eyes blazing, beard shaking....\r\n\r\nThen he drew out the knife carefully, to hide it in the carriage,\r\nlistened again close, felt sure now that death was there, and now\r\nscuttled, as if from plague, guiltily hissing: “Putrid dog...!”\r\n\r\nPresently he led his carriage to the station, and made a deposition of\r\nthe murder.\r\n\r\nAsked if he had any suspicion as to the culprit, he said: “Not the\r\nleast: I left the man alone with the carriage, and who could have had\r\nany motive for killing him beats me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE ELM\r\n\r\n\r\nHogarth, meantime, had made his way to the front of the room, then\r\nvomiting its throng, discovered Loveday, and, deciding to walk home,\r\nthey were soon on the cliffs.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly Loveday: “To-morrow will conclude my fifth week in\r\nWestring. What, do you suppose, has made me stay?”\r\n\r\n“I have wondered”.\r\n\r\n“I work better here...Hogarth, you inspirit me”.\r\n\r\n“Is that so?”\r\n\r\n“It is, yes. Merely your presence is for me a freshness and an\r\nenthusiasm: I catch in the turn of your body hints of adventurous\r\nColumbuses, Drakes, nimble Achilles; and sibylline meanings in some\r\nglance of yours infect my fancy with images of Moses, blind old\r\nHomers--prophet, lawgiver, poet--”\r\n\r\nThey were passing along a stretch of sand, with some lights of Lowestoft\r\nin sight, arm in arm; and Hogarth said: “Well, you speak some big words.\r\nBut my life, you understand, has been as simple and small as possible.\r\nI will tell you: my father sent me to an extraordinary school--where he\r\ngot the coin I could never find out--Lancing College at Shoreham. There\r\nI did very well--only that I was continually _getting_ it! What was\r\nthe matter with me when a boy I can't understand: I was the devil. One\r\nsummer vacation (I was fourteen) I stole three pounds from the old\r\nman, and ran away one Sunday night. Passed through London and soon was\r\napprentice in a blacksmith's shop in a Kent village called Bigham. But\r\nin six months I had the forge at my fingers' ends, and was off: nothing\r\ncould hold me long. One day I turned up before the Recruiting Office\r\nof Marines in Bristol--just of the right age for what they call\r\n'second-class boys'--and decided upon the sea--that sea there--which,\r\nfrom the moment I saw it at the age of four, caused me a swelling of\r\nthe breast with which, to this day, it afflicts me. Well, I got the\r\nbirth-certificate of another boy, scraped through, was entered into a\r\nDistrict Ship, and finally sailed in the _St. Vincent_ to the Pacific\r\nStation.\r\n\r\n“However, my trial of His Majesty's ships was not a success: twice I was\r\nin irons, once leapt into mid-ocean; nor could the battleship hold me\r\nwhen she had nothing to teach me; so I did to the King what I had done\r\nto the old man--cut and ran.\r\n\r\n“It was at Valparaiso, and I made my way across the continent to Buenos\r\nAyres.\r\n\r\n“I forget now what took me to Bristol: but there I was one day when I\r\nhappened to see--what do you think?--a girl--sixteen--I a stripling of\r\nnineteen, or so--but she most precocious, spoke like a woman--a grating\r\nin a wall between us. Ah, well, God is good, and His Mercy endureth for\r\never. But she said it could never be--she a Jewess: though that, by the\r\nway, is nonsense, for she is a Jewess, and a Parisienne, and a Hindoo,\r\nand a Negress, and a Japanese, and the man who marries her will have a\r\nharem. My friend, I have seen her this very night!”\r\n\r\nHe was silent. Suddenly he broke out: “I came home raving! The old man\r\nwas scared out of his wits by my frenzy--I drank like ten men--in a\r\nmonth was the terror of Westring. One midnight, going home through the\r\nbeech-wood--I don't know if you have noticed a hollow elm-tree which\r\nstands to the right of the path?”\r\n\r\n“I think I have”, said Loveday.\r\n\r\n“We shall pass near it presently; and at the moment when we approach it,\r\nI shall feel a little thrill in my back: always it is so with me. But I\r\nwas saying: that midnight, as I passed the tree, drunk as I was, I saw\r\na naked black man with a long beard run out; I took to my heels; he was\r\nafter me; till I reached the bridge, when I stopped, faced him, fired a\r\nblow into his eyes, and he vanished.\r\n\r\n“During the week I continued to see apparitions. My groans were heard in\r\nthe farm-yard: Lord have mercy upon me! Christ have mercy upon me! I was\r\nvisited by the Methodist preacher at Thring; and finally I found solace:\r\nI became a class-member, a leader, a local preacher.\r\n\r\n“For some time I have been conscious of dissatisfaction among the people\r\nwith my preaching, who say that my God 'is not a personal God', and that\r\nmy Christianity is 'rum stuff': I am therefore meaning to give it up.\r\nBut I still preach every second Thursday night.\r\n\r\n“It was about that time that, by accident, I found out the power of my\r\nhand to cure headache, and things like that, and the sensation among\r\nthese villagers was enormous, I can tell you, six years ago; now they\r\ncome to be touched without the slighest sense of the unusual. But what I\r\nhave done well in was--the farming. I knew little of agriculture--”\r\n\r\nAt this point they turned into the lane to Westring: and Loveday went\r\nwith him a little beyond Priddlestone to see the fatal elm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE METEOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after breakfast, Hogarth went down old Thring Street,\r\nand spent a penny for a note-book to contain the signatures of his\r\nassociation.\r\n\r\nBut this was no day for interest in that scheme: for under the\r\nprojecting first-floor of the paper-shop were newspaper placards bearing\r\nsuch words as:\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH IN DANGER\r\n\r\nSHALL WE PERISH TO-NIGHT?\r\n\r\nand Hogarth was soon bending in the street over a paragraph, short--but\r\nin _pica_.\r\n\r\nM. Tissot, the astronomer, had, at half-past ten the previous night,\r\nobserved through the 40-inch telescope of the Nice observatory a body\r\nwhich seemed a tiny planet or aerolite of abnormal size. It was sighted\r\nat a point two degrees W. of _a_ Librae at an angle of 43 1/2° with\r\nthe horizon, and had been photographed, its elements calculated, its\r\nspectrum taken. The ascertained diameter was 3° 17”, or about 73 miles,\r\nand its substance seemed to consist of ironstone mixed with diamond.\r\n\r\nBy noon a fresh light was thrown upon the little world, the Yerkes\r\nobservatory and Greenwich both uttering their voice, the Astronomer\r\nRoyal announcing that the so-called planet was merely a meteor--not more\r\nthan 400 yards in diameter, with a low velocity of two miles a second;\r\nand its distance was less than a tenth of that estimated by Tissot. The\r\nYerkes observatory fixed the diameter at 230 yards. All, however, agreed\r\nin the opinion that it must strike the earth between ten and twelve that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThese later announcements so much allayed the panic, that by one o'clock\r\nHogarth, on peeping into the note-book on the box before the smithy, saw\r\nsix signatures; and a young man who came about six P.M. to sign, cried\r\nout: “Hullo! the book is filled up!” on which Hogarth ran out, saying:\r\n“Don't run away on that account, I'll run and get--” darting into the\r\nhouse to ask Margaret where a certain account-book was.\r\n\r\n“Didn't I throw it into the box of rubbish in the cellar at Lagden, when\r\nwe were leaving?” she asked; on which he threw off his apron, and was\r\noff toward Lagden Dip to get it.\r\n\r\nHe had almost cleared the village when he was blocked by a crowd before\r\na cottage, from out of which were coming screams--a woman's; and he ran\r\nin, found a man named Fred Bates beating his wife, planted a blow on his\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the wife of Bates was found dead, greatly disfigured\r\nabout the face, whereupon Bates was arrested, and Hogarth, as we shall\r\nsee, was subpoenaed to give evidence of the beating.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes he was at the old farm-house of the Hogarths.\r\n\r\nThe new tenant was a Mr. Bond, a bankrupt metal-broker, who had\r\ntwo hobbies--farming and astronomy; and, as Hogarth approached the\r\nyard-gate, he saw Mr. Bond, his two daughters, his servants, grouped\r\nround an optic tube mounted on a tripod. He asked permission to get the\r\naccount-book, got it, in a few minutes was again passing through, and,\r\nas he went by, bowing his thanks, Mr. Bond said: “But--have you seen the\r\nasteroid?”\r\n\r\n“No--whereabouts?”\r\n\r\n“Not quite visible to the naked eye yet: but come--you shall see”.\r\n\r\nHe himself looked through, fixing the sight, turning the adjuster; then\r\nwith fussy suddenness: “Now, sir--”\r\n\r\nHogarth put an eager eye to the glass.\r\n\r\n“You see her?” said Mr. Bond, rubbing his soft old palms; “straight for\r\nus she comes--in a considerable hurry by this time, I can tell you! and\r\nif she happens to break up in the air, then, pray, sir, that a splinter\r\nof her may fall into your back yard--not too big a one! but a nice\r\nlittle comfortable _piece_”--he rubbed his palms--“for you know, no\r\ndoubt, of what her substance is composed? Diamond, sir, in extraordinary\r\nevidence! in conjunction with specular iron ore, commonly called the red\r\nhaematite, and the ferrous carbonate, or spathic iron. You see her, sir?\r\nyou see her?”\r\n\r\nHogarth whispered: “Yes”.\r\n\r\nThere, fairest among ten thousand, sailing the high seas she came; and\r\nlonger than was modest he stopped there, gazing, then ran, wondering at\r\nher daisy loveliness, not dreaming that between himself and her was--a\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nShe broke up with a European display soon after eleven that night over\r\nthe North Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nHOGARTH'S GUNS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the moment when Hogarth was peering through the telescope, a man was\r\nloitering before his cottage--one of the Hall's park-keepers; and\r\nwhen Margaret put out her head to look for Richard's coming, the man\r\nwhistled.\r\n\r\nIn a moment a note was in her hand.\r\n\r\n“DEAR MISS HOGARTH,\r\n\r\n“This is to ask you to be certain sure to meet me this evening at 9 P.M.\r\non the towpath. It isn't to-day that you are well aware of the state of\r\nmy feelings toward you: but it is not to talk sweethearting that I\r\nwish to see you now, but about your brother, and the matter is about\r\nas important as can be. If I were in your place, I should destroy this\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n“Yours, with my respects,\r\n\r\n“BARUCH FRANKL”.\r\n\r\nMargaret tore it up, and “My goodness!” she thought, “what is anyone to\r\ndo? If I only had the money to make up those fifty pounds! May the Holy\r\nSpirit guide me now...!”\r\n\r\nLater in the evening she stole out, and met Frankl.\r\n\r\nHe assumed a very respectful tone.\r\n\r\n“Miss Hogarth”, said he at once, “have you heard?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir”.\r\n\r\n“You have not been told that your brother has been to the Hall?”\r\n\r\n“What in patience for?”\r\n\r\n“He came--you couldn't believe--to beat me!”\r\n\r\n“Richard! I don't understand. When?”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday”. (In reality it was four weeks before.)\r\n\r\n“But what about?”\r\n\r\n“Revenge! Blind, murderous revenge for turning him neck and crop out of\r\nLagden!”\r\n\r\n“You _are_ in a temper! But I can't understand a word of it!”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is what I had to tell you. He came to my house--And how good\r\nhave I been to this man! Didn't I send him the fifty pounds--?”\r\n\r\n“Well, that _was_ kind. But I must tell you, Mr. Frankl, that Richard\r\nknows nothing of the fifty pounds--”\r\n\r\n“Well, then it is _your_ fault! Oh, he did not know of the fifty\r\npounds? Then it is your fault entirely, this rage of his against me--He\r\nthreatened to shoot me dead--thrice he threatened--soon, he said--”\r\n\r\n“Not Richard?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Richard!--your nice Richard! But what did I want you for to-night?\r\nIt was to let you see that I have it in my power to let your brother in\r\nfor three months hard--not less. But you know, my dear, don't you, that\r\nI wouldn't do anything to give you pain? That is why, so far, I've\r\ntaken no steps. But your brother must be unarmed. I can't have my life\r\nexposed, after his threats, and all”.\r\n\r\n“Unarmed....”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I have it on good authority that your brother has guns. I must\r\nhave those guns put into my own hands by you...”\r\n\r\n“But I couldn't! He would find out...”\r\n\r\n“Then I must act, that's all. Or no--I give you another chance--tell him\r\nof the fifty pounds I sent--that may disarm him in another way--”\r\n\r\nHe was sure that this she would not now do, yet felt relieved when she\r\ncried out: “I couldn't! Not now! Can't you see?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there is nothing to be done, then. I must act, that's all”.\r\n\r\n“But don't be _hard_! What can I do? Sooner or later he'd be sure to\r\nmiss them!”\r\n\r\n“Poh! he is not always shooting, I suppose? And after a few weeks I'd\r\ngive them back. Anyway, think it over: and I'll be here on Tuesday night\r\nnext at nine to receive them. Good night--”\r\n\r\nShe looked palely after him, her feet in a net, new to her, woven of\r\nconcealments and deceit.\r\n\r\nAt eleven that night she was sitting in their diminutive\r\nparlour,--Hogarth at a table inscribing the association's names received\r\nby post that evening; and at last, bending low over her sewing, she\r\nsaid: “Richard, is it true you have been to the Hall?”\r\n\r\nHe started! “Yes. Who told you?”\r\n\r\n“I heard it”.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her piercingly. “_Answer!_”\r\n\r\n“I heard it”, she said with a stubborn nod, quite pallid.\r\n\r\nHe turned upon her a stare of displeasure; but in that second they heard\r\na shouting down the village, ran to the front, and saw heaven all like\r\ncancer and cracked window-panes, for from a central plash of passion the\r\nshattered asteroid had shot long-lingering ribbons of lilac light over\r\nthe bowl of the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nISAAC\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday was the inquest on the murdered Mephibosheth; ending in a\r\nverdict of wilful murder against some person unknown.\r\n\r\nThe same night at nine Frankl had Hogarth's two guns from Margaret on\r\nthe towing-path, she now well inveigled into his net, and under his\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\n“I want you”, he said, “to meet me-here again on Thursday night, at\r\n7.30”.\r\n\r\n“But you will tell one why, I suppose!”\r\n\r\n“When you come you will hear. And don't let anything keep you away--not\r\n_anything_, mind--if you take my hint”.\r\n\r\nShe left him with her head hung, praying for deliverance, but\r\nconsenting.\r\n\r\nThe next (Wednesday) morning Frankl was in a high room of the Hall, in a\r\ncorner of which cowered the Arab, Isaac, and he said in his strong bass\r\nin Arabic: “Well, Isaac, well”.\r\n\r\nA groan broke from the obese heap of grief; down each side of his kefie\r\nstreamed waves of trembling; on his square-cut beard of ritual flecks of\r\nfoam.\r\n\r\n“Isaac, why did you kill Mephibosheth?”\r\n\r\nVigorously sputtered Isaac, spitting out the ill-omened words. He said:\r\n“Your servant did not kill Mephibosheth”.\r\n\r\n“Well, there was an inquest to-day, the Court decided that you did, and\r\nhas sentenced you to be hanged by the neck like a dog”.\r\n\r\nThe Arab sprang up, his thick bluish under-lip shivering.\r\n\r\n“An eye for an eye”, said Frankl solemnly: “it is written in the Torah”.\r\n\r\n“_Mercy_ My father served your father--”\r\n\r\n“I have remembered that: that is why I have saved you from hanging like\r\na dog at the hands of these _Goyim_ vermin: but, Isaac, you must die--”\r\n\r\n“God of--!”\r\n\r\n“You dare raise your voice! Blood for blood--”\r\n\r\n“_Mercy_!--I did not mean to kill--!”\r\n\r\n“Blood for blood, you dog! Raise it, and I fell you! Raise it, and the\r\nnoose sinks into your fat swine's-throat! Can't you understand?--you\r\nhave been tracked by the avengers of blood! and you may swing\r\nlingeringly, with a crowd of Christian boys and girls mocking round you,\r\nor you may shoot yourself in one painless flash. Which shall it be?”\r\n\r\nIsaac, again dropping a-heap, covered his face, without answer.\r\n\r\n“Well”, said Frankl, walking away, “I can't wait all day. The detectives\r\nare at this moment downstairs--”\r\n\r\nNow the Arab leapt up, and, in a movement of great dignity, with an\r\nout-rush of both arms, rent his caftan from the top to its muslin\r\ngirdle.\r\n\r\n“I will shoot myself”, he said quietly.\r\n\r\nFrankl took snuff.\r\n\r\nThe same night he took his secretary's typewriter, and spelled out the\r\nfollowing note:\r\n\r\n“SIR,\r\n\r\n“Permit me to ask you as an old friend of your father's if you are\r\naware that your sister Margaret is the lover of the lord of the manor?\r\nEverybody seems to see it, but yourself. I have reason to know that the\r\nvery day you receive this she will be meeting him at about 7.30 P.M.\r\nunder the old elm in the beech-wood near the Hall-park.\r\n\r\n“ONE WHO SHALL BE NAMELESS”.\r\n\r\nHogarth received it by post the next morning.\r\n\r\nHe had to think, as he worked, of something to say at the service that\r\nnight on the text: “God's way is in the Sea”, but the glare of forge and\r\nheated metal swam vaguely, a fog of red, about his consciousness. And\r\nmixed with those recurring words: “the old elm”, “God's way”, something\r\nwith a voice shouted inside him--a name--_Margaret!_ Anon his face\r\nflushed to a dusky turbulence, and he hurled the sledge high to shatter\r\nthe earth, like Thor.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he had the thought that he would clean his rifle, and, dropping\r\na hot iron which vanished with a stifled cry into black water, he tossed\r\nhis tongs clattering, and almost ran toward the cottage.\r\n\r\nHe had not, however, reached the back door when he heard his name called\r\nfrom behind.\r\n\r\nAnd now happened to him the most momentous event of his life--though\r\nnothing could have seemed more commonplace.\r\n\r\nIt was an old fellow named Tom Bates who had called him--father to\r\nthat Fred arrested for the murder of his wife--a Yarmouth fisher and\r\nherring-curer.\r\n\r\nAnd when Hogarth twisted round, with that stare of his large and\r\nbloodshot eye, “Here”, said the old man, “take them”--holding out a\r\nbasket of herrings.\r\n\r\nHogarth seemed not to understand, but then said: “All those for me?”\r\n\r\n“Every bloomin' one!” answered Bates, with the dropped jaw of pantomime,\r\nand a far-away look of blue astonishment which he had.\r\n\r\n“It is extremely handsome of you. Can you spare all that--?”\r\n\r\n“Spare, _ya'as!_ They're easy enough come by, for that matter. Why, the\r\nday's work of a fisherman gives him enough fish to live on all the week,\r\nand he could lie around idling the other six days, if he chose, only\r\nanybody can't live on nothing but fish “.\r\n\r\nThese words, destined to produce a horror of great darkness, and a cup\r\nof trembling of which all the nations should drink, hardly affected\r\nHogarth at the time. He _did_, indeed, shoot an interested glance at the\r\nold man, but the next moment his mind, numb that morning, was left dark.\r\n\r\n“Here--take them--they are yours”, said Bates. “But with regard to\r\nthat God-forsaken son of mine: you'll be givin' evidence agen him, I'm\r\ntold--”\r\n\r\nWhen his sleeve wiped a tear, Hogarth promised to make his evidence\r\nmild, and was left alone.\r\n\r\nNow his purpose of cleaning the rifle was turned: he went back to the\r\nforge, and worked till Margaret, at one o'clock, called: “The dinner is\r\non the table”.\r\n\r\nAt that table, for a long time, silence reigned, Margaret's eyes fixed\r\non his face, his on his plate.\r\n\r\nToward the end he said: “Are you going to chapel to-night?”\r\n\r\nHer bosom heaved; she cleared her throat: she had to meet Frankl by the\r\ntowing-path.\r\n\r\n“I don't think I shall...”\r\n\r\n_Margaret!_\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“I have something to do”.\r\n\r\n“_What?_”\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\n“_What?_”\r\n\r\n“Something”--with a stubborn nod, and pallor--“if I tell you _something_\r\nthat should be enough”.\r\n\r\n“You will go to chapel to-night”.\r\n\r\n“That I shan't”.\r\n\r\n“Yes”\r\n\r\nSilence.\r\n\r\nA little before seven they left the cottage together for the chapel,\r\nHogarth taking his hunting-crop--from habit; he had also a little Bible;\r\nin his jacket, tight at the slight waist, unbuttoned at the breast, lay\r\nthe anonymous letter, and a little poetry-book, neither moon nor star\r\nlighting the night, bleak winds swooping like the typhoon among the\r\nyear's dead leaves.\r\n\r\nThe chapel was a paltry place, though in the wall to the right of the\r\npreacher was a slab bearing the inscription:\r\n\r\n                      ON THIS STONE\r\n                  JOHN WESLEY PREACHED\r\n                 IN THE VILLAGE, ON THE\r\n                      9TH JULY 1768\r\n\r\nAnd they sang a hymn; Hogarth “prayed”; read a chapter; once more the\r\nharmonium mourned; Hogarth gave the text: “God's way is in the sea...”\r\n\r\nEven as he uttered it, he happened to glance toward the “mission-pew”--a\r\nsquare pew rather behind the pulpit: Margaret no longer there.\r\n\r\nA paleness as of very death--then a dreadful wrath reddened his dark\r\nface.\r\n\r\nHe seized his hunting-crop; and, without a word, sped bent and thievish\r\ndown the steps--and was gone.\r\n\r\nUpon which Loveday in a middle pew, perceiving here something sinister,\r\nlike a still wind flew to a back door, before ever the amazement of the\r\npeople had given place to a flutter like leafage; and running fast, he\r\ncame up with Hogarth by a stile twenty yards behind the chapel, touched\r\nhis shoulder.\r\n\r\n“To the devil with you...!” shouted Hogarth, running still, and there\r\nLoveday stood.\r\n\r\nMargaret, meantime, was hurrying toward the towing-path, while Richard,\r\nin a direction at right angles to hers, was pelting toward that spot\r\nterrible to him--the elm.\r\n\r\nAt the moment when he entered the deep darkness of the beeches, he heard\r\nwhat sounded like a pistol-shot, rain now falling drop by drop, and\r\nthrough the forest with an uplifting whoop, like batsmen, swooped the\r\ntomboy winds.\r\n\r\nNow, approaching the elm, again he felt that thrill which the spot had\r\nfor him, and came peering, at slower pace: no sound but the gibbering\r\nrout of the stiff-stark beech-leaves. Some steps more, and now he was\r\nat the mound which surrounds the tree: stood, listened: silence,\r\nsightlessness: Margaret not there.\r\n\r\nOne more forward step: and now his foot struck a body.\r\n\r\nAs he stooped, his hand touched a revolver--which was his own; another\r\nmoment, and he saw running lanterns borne by two park-keepers, and by\r\ntheir light saw the body of Isaac, who but now had shot himself with the\r\nweapon that was in Hogarth's hand.\r\n\r\nThe park-keepers had just been urged by their master to the spot, he\r\nhaving, he told them, heard a pistol-shot; and before anyone could speak\r\nFrankl himself was there, defiled with the presence of the dead.\r\n\r\nHe looked from Hogarth to the corpse, and from the corpse to Hogarth,\r\nthen, snatching the weapon from Hogarth's hand, exclaimed: “Why, bless\r\nmy heart, you've _murdered_ the man....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nWROXHAM BROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a cottage in Thring Street, marked “E. Norfolk, E. 58, Constabulary”,\r\nHogarth passed the night, having been arrested the moment he returned\r\nhome from the elm.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards Margaret, who had found no Frankl at the\r\ntowing-path, came home to the ghastliest amazement throughout Thring, so\r\nthat sleep overcame the village only toward morning.\r\n\r\nAt 7.30 A.M. Hogarth was marched to Beccles, then after an\r\ninquest-verdict appeared before the magistrates' court, and was\r\ncommitted.\r\n\r\nOne of the witnesses in the summary-jurisdiction court had been Loveday,\r\nwho had deposed that Hogarth, on leaving the chapel, was, beyond doubt,\r\nin a passion; and mixed with the crowd was Margaret, who, standing\r\nthickly veiled, heard that evidence. And thought she: “Is it possible\r\nthat he can be giving evidence against Richard like that? And smiling,\r\nthe mean, false thing--”\r\n\r\nShe had disappeared on the morning after the arrest: and Loveday was now\r\nracked by disquiet, wondering how she was living, though she and he were\r\nin the same train, unconscious of each other, when he followed Hogarth\r\nto Norwich; and, as Margaret stepped upon the Thorpe platform there, a\r\nJew, who was watching the arrival of every train, spied and shadowed\r\nher to the old Maid's Head, this intricate city being now crowded, the\r\nAssizes all in the air, mixed with the Saturday cattle-market.\r\n\r\nAt ten the next morning Margaret learned at the Guildhall the address\r\nof her brother's defending solicitor, and set out to find him, the\r\nwretchedest woman on earth now.\r\n\r\nBut as she passed by the archway in the tower of St. Peter Mancroft,\r\nLoveday stood before her; and she started like a shying horse.\r\n\r\n“Good morning”--she went on past him.\r\n\r\nHe took two steps after her. “Are you in a hurry? Can I come with you?”\r\n\r\n“It is quite near. Thank you--I'd liefer go alone”.\r\n\r\nHe, a delicate being, all nerves, was repelled; lifted the old cloth\r\nhat; but then again stepped after her, saying: “But are you angry with\r\nme for something?”\r\n\r\n“Why should I be? I have no right to expect anything from you, Mr.\r\nLoveday”.\r\n\r\n“No right? You _have_, a little, I fancy!”\r\n\r\nHe said it at her ear with such a lowering of the eyelids, that it\r\npierced to her fond heart, and she smiled with a “H'm!” uncertain, half\r\nturned to him; but said: “I must be getting on--”\r\n\r\n“But it is most important that I should talk to you about everything.\r\nWhere are you staying?”\r\n\r\n“It is some distance from here”, she answered, undecided whether or not\r\nto give her address.\r\n\r\n“Ah--in that case--but still--will you meet me? Say here--this evening?”\r\n\r\n“I will see if I can”.\r\n\r\n“At seven?”\r\n\r\n“I will see”.\r\n\r\nSo they parted, she to tread that intricacy of streets round the Market,\r\nwith stoppages for enquiries, till she found the office, where she\r\npresently sat in an inner room, veil at nose-tip, and before her at a\r\ngrate stood Hogarth's solicitor.\r\n\r\nWhat, till now, for shame, she had concealed, she revealed: showing how\r\nRichard could not possibly have taken the revolver with him to the elm,\r\nsince she, two days previously, had secretly given it to--someone.\r\n\r\nMr. Carr, the solicitor, frowned, elaborating his nails.\r\n\r\n“This is very extraordinary”, he said. “Whyever did you keep us in\r\nthe dark as to all this before? And to whom was it that you gave the\r\nrevolver? and why?”\r\n\r\n“Am I bound to tell that?”\r\n\r\n“No, but you may be sure that the truth will be got from you. Stay--I\r\nmust ask you to excuse me now. But tomorrow morning at this hour--will\r\nyou? As for your brother, have no fears at all: he is now absolutely\r\nsafe”.\r\n\r\nMargaret went rapidly away, not knowing whither, only returning toward\r\nlate afternoon to her inn. As she entered, a letter was handed her from\r\nFrankl.\r\n\r\n“Dear Miss Hogarth:\r\n\r\n“It is only due to you that I should see you at once to explain the\r\nmystery of this affair, so as to clear your brother, and as it would not\r\ndo for me to call upon you for obvious reasons, the only thing for us to\r\ndo is to meet to-night on Mousehold Heath at 7 P.M. without fail...”\r\n\r\nWhat now was she to do? At “7 P.M.” she had half promised Loveday to\r\nmeet him.\r\n\r\nAnd what had her meetings with Baruch Frankl, innocent as they were,\r\nbrought upon her and hers!\r\n\r\nYet Frankl _must_ be kindly intentioned, she reasoned--since he had sent\r\nthem the £50; and she thought of that agony of humiliation when she had\r\nasked Loveday for £2, and he had refused.\r\n\r\nAnd he had given evidence against Richard with his down-turned smile.\r\n\r\nBut he had said a word at her ear--and her crushed heart had leapt. She\r\ndid not know what to do, fell by her bedside and prayed to be taught\r\nwhich of the two was Richard's best friend.\r\n\r\nAs she passed over the inn-threshold, she decided in favour of Frankl:\r\nand a few minutes past seven was on Mousehold Heath.\r\n\r\nFrankl hurried to meet her, and the hand which he held out was rather\r\ncold; but she did not take it.\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Frankl”, said she, “before I give my hand, it is only what\r\nis due to me to hear how Richard's pistol, which I trusted to you, was\r\nfound where it was--”\r\n\r\n“Well, that is only fair”, answered Frankl; “that is only fair. But I\r\nhave a carriage there, let us get into it, and sit as we talk”.\r\n\r\nShe could see no carriage in that dark, yet it stood only some yards\r\naway--Frankl's own.\r\n\r\n“I think I prefer to stand...” said she.\r\n\r\n“As you like. But with regard to the gun, I should have thought that\r\nyou could have guessed how it was--but no, you always mistrust me\r\ninstead--the Jew. Don't you know that the dead man was a servant in my\r\nhouse? Well, I left the two guns in my study, and he, wanting to shoot\r\nhimself, stole one, that's all”.\r\n\r\n“It was _he_ shot himself?”\r\n\r\n“Why, who else? You don't suppose Richard shot him! You are as cool as\r\nthey make them”.\r\n\r\n“Well, that was how it was! But couldn't you say that at the\r\npolice-court--?”\r\n\r\n“I am _going_ to at the big trial, of course. But I was ill, am ill now,\r\nand here have I been running about all day on your brother's behalf, and\r\ndead tired--and ill, and all--and you won't let me have a rest in the\r\ncarriage--”\r\n\r\n“Well, as you put it in that way...” she said.\r\n\r\nSo they walked to a motor-brougham, sat within, and as they commenced to\r\ntalk again, the brougham moved.\r\n\r\n“Tell me”, said Frankl, “have you mentioned to anyone that you had given\r\nthe guns to me?”\r\n\r\n“I told Richard's solicitor this morning--”\r\n\r\n“That was horribly imprudent, without consulting me!”\r\n\r\n“I think I have been silent long enough, don't you? I didn't mention\r\nyour name, but--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you didn't mention my name! That's all right, then! Look here, do\r\nyou know--?”\r\n\r\n“Well?”\r\n\r\n“I believe you love me in your heart. Can't help yourself”.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mr. Frankl, do I look as if I was in the mood for that kind of fun\r\nto-night, a poor wretch like me, steeped in misery, my God knows”.\r\n\r\n“_I_ love _you_!”\r\n\r\nHe suddenly grasped her wrist, his eyes blazing.\r\n\r\n“Stop--let me get out of this--” she said.\r\n\r\n“Wait!--I give you your chance!--Listen: I am not a man whose mind you\r\ncan read right off like a book, I twist like an eel, I am deep, I am\r\ntricky, and I never yet met the man that I didn't hoodwink. Ninety-nine\r\nper cent of what I say is a lie; even when it is the truth, it is a\r\nlie just the same. But at this particular moment I am talking the God's\r\ntruth: I want you! You shall be my little girl! Chuck Richard!--chuck\r\nthe swine's-flesh!--I'll take you right away--to Paris--this very\r\nnight--”\r\n\r\nShe had arisen, alarmed by his hissed fury. “But, you are stark,\r\nstaring, raving mad”, she said proudly, “that is what you are”.\r\n\r\nFrankl struck the side of the brougham, it flew, and Margaret tottered\r\nbackward with an exclamation. The next moment she sent forth a scream,\r\nthe grip of Frankl on her wrist agonizing her bones.\r\n\r\n“Where are we going?” she cried out.\r\n\r\n“I gave you your chance!” was Frankl's fierce answer.\r\n\r\n“Let me get out!--you must be a wretch--to take advantage--”\r\n\r\nHe put his mouth to her ear till it touched. “Your nice Richard flogged\r\nme like a dog! I felt the cuts to the marrow of my damned soul! Now I've\r\ngot him in the hollow of this hand! Why, you helped me! you helped me!\r\nThat's good! And I've got you, too”.\r\n\r\nBlackness and swiftness bound her; a dizziness overcame her. Soon they\r\nwere by a great pool of gloomy water--Wroxham Broad--where hern, wild\r\nduck, and the mast of the darkling boat brooded among bulrush; and\r\nnow in three minutes more the brougham was sweeping over the lawn of a\r\nlonely building, surrounded by walls.\r\n\r\nShe, peering, saw with joy both lights and a well-dressed man and woman;\r\nand, as the carriage stopped, she sprang out with alacrity, Frankl with\r\nher, still grasping her wrist.\r\n\r\n“Sir”, she blurted out at once, “you will help me, I know. I am a poor\r\nunfortunate woman--my name is Margaret Hogarth--”\r\n\r\n“We know!” said the gentleman, and, approaching Frankl's ear, asked in\r\nYiddish: “How long has she had her delusion?”\r\n\r\n“Only about a week, I think. She may be violent at first, but--”\r\n\r\n“Come in, Miss--Hogarth”, said the gentleman.\r\n\r\nMargaret passed the threshold; the doors closed upon her...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE ROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the third morning of his confinement in Norwich, Hogarth was hurried\r\ninto the hall of justice and the witness-box--in the dock Fred Bates.\r\n\r\nBates had denied--with sufficient impudence, it seemed: for his wife\r\nhad been found dead, battered and burned about the face, Bates' own hand\r\nalso burned by the poker with which, _red-hot_, he was presumed to have\r\nbeaten her.\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon Bates was sentenced to death: but, having had\r\nsunstroke in Egypt, was afterwards reprieved.\r\n\r\nAnd two mornings later Hogarth heard the bar of the prisoner's dock\r\nclang behind himself.\r\n\r\nThe speech of leading counsel for the Crown was short: a letter, found\r\non the prisoner, would be produced, in which some busybody had falsely\r\ninformed the prisoner that Mr. Frankl would meet his sister under a\r\ncertain elm-tree: and the prisoner, in a crisis of passion, had hurried\r\nfrom the pulpit to that tree, on observing that his sister had left the\r\nchapel (to keep a real appointment with Mr. Frankl elsewhere). Under\r\nthat tree the prisoner had encountered the murdered man, whose Oriental\r\ndress on a dark night would give him a resemblance to Mr. Frankl,\r\nhimself a Jew. The prisoner had then shot the deceased, mistaking him\r\nfor Mr. Frankl, and had been found holding the smoking weapon, which\r\nhe admitted to be his own. It was a painful case; but the chain of\r\ninference was not assailable.\r\n\r\n“Not assailable” found an echo in the minds of solicitor and counsel for\r\nHogarth, who with growing anxiety were awaiting the coming of Margaret\r\nwith her story of the weapons. Margaret was where her name was changed\r\nto Rachel.\r\n\r\nNow was the régime of examining counsel for the prosecution. The usher\r\ncalled: “Baruch Frankl!”\r\n\r\nA voice in the gallery shouted: “Caps and tassels!” while Frankl, in the\r\nwitness box, bowed largely to both bench and bar. He put his palms on\r\nthe red-hot rail, caught them up, put them again, caught up, put them;\r\nand still he bowed, while a trembling of the chin gave to his beard a\r\ndownward waving.\r\n\r\n“Now explain to the court the reasons for the state of the prisoner's\r\nfeelings toward you”.\r\n\r\n“For one thing I had turned him out, because he could not pay his rent;\r\nfor another, his sister was inclined, my lord, to be a little bit weak\r\non my account--”\r\n\r\n“A little bit _what_?” asked his lordship.\r\n\r\n“Just a little bit weak, my lord”.\r\n\r\n“A _reciprocal_ weakness?”\r\n\r\n“Well, my lord, you know the world--so do the gentlemen of the jury--”\r\n\r\n“And of the Jewry!” screamed his lordship, amid laughter from the merry\r\nwigs.\r\n\r\nAs Frankl stepped down, a name was called at which Hogarth went cold as\r\na ghost: “Rebekah Frankl”.\r\n\r\nAnd in she stepped splendent, to stand like a Nubian woman, with that\r\nretreat of the hips, her ears torn with their load of gold, her throat\r\nand breast ablaze, she bringing into that English court the gaudy heat\r\nof the Orient, Baal and Astarté, orgies of Hindoo women in temples of\r\nParvati, the pallid passion of Bacchantes. Though not tall, she was\r\nlofty, and her ebon eyes had that very royalty of the stare of the bent\r\nform in the dock, whose heart throbbed quick like paddle-wheels that\r\nthrash the sea, she his wild divinity, wild wife of his wild youth....\r\n\r\nAt her shocking beauty the Court stood hushed.\r\n\r\nShe suggested the East: but in her speech was the energy of the\r\nWest--sharp--a bass almost like her father's.\r\n\r\n“You recognize the prisoner?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”. She smiled.\r\n\r\n“You were present on the day of the 11th November when the prisoner\r\nentered your father's house, and attempted to strike him?”\r\n\r\n“Did strike him”.\r\n\r\n“He did?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”.\r\n\r\n“Did he seem in a passion?”\r\n\r\n“Seemed severe”.\r\n\r\n“Severe! But was he not highly excited?”\r\n\r\n“He did not seem so. Frowned and flogged”.\r\n\r\n“By whom was he ejected?”\r\n\r\n“Went of his own accord”.\r\n\r\n“But--try to remember. What made him go?”\r\n\r\n“He suddenly saw _me_, and fled”.\r\n\r\nLaughter droned through the court, in which she naïvely joined, while\r\nHogarth's eyes and hers met one instant, blazed outrageously, and\r\ndropped....\r\n\r\nThat was all. Counsel bowed.\r\n\r\nThe day grew toward evening, and still the stuffy Court sat.\r\n\r\nBut Margaret Hogarth did not come; a defending counsel finished\r\nexamination, counsel on the other side again addressed the Court,\r\nand again defending counsel. The judge then held the scales, the jury\r\ntrooped away, the crowd buzzed.\r\n\r\nThe light in the room seemed to brood to a denser yellow, and anon to\r\ngrow dim; the stuffed court festered; voices spoke, but low. The King of\r\nTerrors was here.\r\n\r\nWhen the jury came, the judge was called, Hogarth stood up, and the\r\nclerk of arraigns put a question to the foreman.\r\n\r\nThe foreman said: “We find the prisoner guilty: but beg to recommend him\r\nto the mercy of the Crown”.\r\n\r\n“On what grounds?” asked his lordship.\r\n\r\n“On the grounds of past good conduct and strong provocation”.\r\n\r\nThe judge then placed on his head a square of velvet and passed the\r\nsentence of the Court.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of stillness that followed, while the court clock's\r\nticking was still loud, something which was thrown struck Hogarth on the\r\narm, a red rose, black at heart, that had lain on the breast of Rebekah,\r\nwho, when Hogarth looked round at her, was calmly drawing her mass of\r\ncloak about her throat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nOUT OF THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nA week later a governor and a chaplain together entered Hogarth's cell\r\nwith news of his reprieve.\r\n\r\nEight months later he was being trundled in “Black Maria” to Paddington\r\nStation amid a Babel of escaped tongues, when, sitting in his\r\npigeonhole, he heard the unknown voice before him cry: “Well, Jim, we're\r\naway to the mountain's brow!”\r\n\r\nJim, nothing but a voice, was heard: “Worse luck! I knows Colmoor, and\r\nI knows the Scrubs, and I knows Portland; and of the five I say--give me\r\nJedwood. Who's the guy in front o' you?”\r\n\r\n“Hi, you in front there, who _are_ yer?” cried the first, pounding.\r\n\r\nHe was answered by a deep voice, which said:\r\n\r\n“I AM WHO I AM”.\r\n\r\n“All right, keep yer 'air on, if you've any left! It's the Lawd Chief\r\nJustice, mate! 'E says 'e's 'oo 'e are!”\r\n\r\n“'Old on! _I_ knows who it is: it's that new-comer, 33. They say he was\r\nonce a priest--”\r\n\r\nBut now speech was swallowed up in hubbub, as the van ran battering down\r\na rough street near the station.\r\n\r\nThen again Hogarth was whirled into night and space, and, toward\r\nmorning, after the bumping climb of a van, was bidden to alight on\r\nmoorland, where he spied, far off, set on a hill, a mighty palace of\r\nRomance, all grim, aloof, which was Colmoor.\r\n\r\nThe next morning while the outdoor gangs were being searched on parade\r\nbefore the exit, Hogarth saw a face which he knew; and “You, Bates”, he\r\nsaid, “I thought you were in Eternity!”\r\n\r\nBut no: there stood Bates, all capped and arrowed, cropped and neat, not\r\nwearing the filthy old scarf of liberty any more.\r\n\r\nThe neighbor of Hogarth now was a stout man, with black hair, and grey\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe it was who had been--a priest: and in “Black Maria” had given that\r\nanswer: “I am who I am”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nTHE PRIEST\r\n\r\n\r\nA year passed, during which John Loveday exhausted the resources of\r\ncivilization, (1)in seeking Margaret, and (2)in investigating the\r\ninnocence of Richard.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, a sprightly, adventurous nerve in the mind, and would\r\npull his velvet sleeves busily up--such was his little way. He began to\r\nplot.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the ex-priest, in that far-off world of Colmoor,\r\nsaid one day to Hogarth: “_You_ won't be here long!”\r\n\r\n“You jest,” Hogarth answered; “if I had the chance of escape, I should\r\nnever take it. I am here by due legal process”.\r\n\r\n“Tut, if I say that you will escape, it is not because I am a prophet,\r\nbut a man of the world, and know what happens in it”.\r\n\r\nConverse with this deep, world-wise, and fluent man had now become to\r\nHogarth like manna, or rather a vice, like opium: for in those grey eyes\r\nof the cleric was hinted anon the baleful glint of the cobra's.\r\n\r\nThat day, a Saturday, outdoor gangs were recalled early, to “clean up”\r\n for Sunday, and out across the heath rang the great bell, Colmoor being\r\nfamous for its bell, its tone and great size, larger than even the\r\neight-ton “Mighty Tom” of Christ Church, for though its thickness was\r\nonly six inches, it weighed, bell and clapper, ten tons, and was seven\r\nfeet high and seven in diameter.\r\n\r\nA busy Saturday afternoon ensued, and whatsoever Hogarth's hand found to\r\ndo he did it with his might, though his face now seemed all eyes--brown,\r\nbloodshot, imperially large, morbidly staring.\r\n\r\nHe was giving the finishing touches of order to his wooden spoon and\r\nsalt-cellar, his tin knife, plate, and pint cup for gruel, when a Warder\r\nJennings peeped in with, “No. 76--you are to follow the assistant warder\r\nat once”, and Hogarth descended to an ante-room where an official\r\nhanded him a letter, which had been read and initialed by governor and\r\nchaplain.\r\n\r\nAn event!--a letter in Colmoor, like a shark's fin on the voyages of old\r\nsailing ships.\r\n\r\nIt was from Loveday, and concluded with a reference to Hogarth's “poor\r\nold grandmother”.\r\n\r\nSo Hogarth, who had no “grandmother”, propped his forehead to ponder\r\nthat thing; and presently said: “Oh, it is a cypher”.\r\n\r\nAnd by noting little peculiarities in the shapes of the letters,\r\na double cross to a t, a q like a g, etc., he soon had\r\n“flemecops-leftquary”--which he took to mean: “flee to me in the copse\r\nto the left of the quarry”.\r\n\r\nHe smiled with tenderness at the dear heart planning and daring so\r\nvery much for him. But in his smile was a touch of disdain also, he not\r\nintending to “flee”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nMONSIGNOR\r\n\r\n\r\nHogarth's first thought, as getting-up bell clattered réveille through\r\nthe gallery, was of Loveday's cypher, and by the time the warder came\r\nto ask if he would see governor or doctor, a thought of Monsignor O'Hara\r\nhad somehow mixed itself with the thought of the cypher; when an orderly\r\nhanded in the day's brown loaf, he was thinking, “Strange that he never\r\ntold me what he has done”; eating his pint of gruel, he thought: “If I\r\nwill not escape myself, I might perhaps let another.”\r\n\r\n“What!” said O'Hara on the march out, “you still here?”\r\n\r\n“Where should I be?” answered Hogarth, dull and sullen.\r\n\r\n“Where palaces stand open for you, and bank-notes--have you ever\r\nrealized something very charming in the Helen pallor of a bank-note,\r\nHogarth? And gold-yellow, sparkling gold! Hogarth, I--_love_ gold! It is\r\na confession--”\r\n\r\n“Is it that love which brought you here?” Hogarth asked with his\r\nsideward stare.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the priest turned a cold gaze upon him--had regarded Hogarth\r\nas a well-bred man, or would hardly have conversed with him.\r\n\r\n“I had a motive for asking”, said Hogarth, eyeing the face of the\r\nprelate--a man of very coarse feature; a small head, made to receive the\r\ntonsure, with a low brow; a stern bottom lip, and long upper; a fat neck\r\nheld majestically erect; and up stuck his double chin. In profile,\r\nthe part between the sharp edge of the bottom lip and the chin-tip was\r\ndivided, down near the chin tip, by an angle and crease; and the lower\r\nface seemed too massive for the size of the head.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more exquisite than the contrast between his air of\r\nforce, authority and importance, and the knickerbockers, the coarse cap,\r\nthe canvas slop-jacket, which he wore.\r\n\r\nOutwardly calm, he was yet very excited by that “I had a motive”; he\r\nsaid to himself: “Suppose this man has some plan! He could invent ten,\r\nif he only knew it. And suppose he would tell me it, if I make him\r\nbelieve me innocent! It would be like him!”\r\n\r\nWhen the eleven o'clock dinner-bell rang, and they two were again\r\ntogether, O'Hara said: “Hogarth, I have for some time been intending to\r\ngive you my story. Have I in your eyes the air of a guilty man?”\r\n\r\n“God knows,” answered Hogarth, with a shrug; “you talk nicely, and you\r\nknow much”.\r\n\r\n“So much for the hollowness of friendship!”\r\n\r\n“Don't be sentimental”, said Hogarth: “I never pretended to be any\r\nfriend of yours; but I do respect your talents, do pity your misery:\r\nand if I knew the solid facts of, as you have said, your 'innocence', I\r\nmight--”\r\n\r\n“_What_?” whispered O'Hara with a thievish, fierce glance.\r\n\r\n“Help you”.\r\n\r\n“_In God's truth?_”\r\n\r\n“I might”.\r\n\r\nO'Hara said: “I don't find it so cold as it was this morning. You must\r\nhave observed a certain peculiarity of moorland climates--the same\r\nbeing true of the Roman Campagna, and of Irish peat-lands--that they\r\nare colder than elsewhere in the absence of the sun, and warmer in its\r\npresence. This afternoon--_I will tell you_--”\r\n\r\nThey had reached the great gates, and were marched to parade-ground for\r\nthe second of the four daily searches; then, after three ounces of fat\r\nmutton and forty minutes' rest, the third search, the second march-out.\r\n\r\nAnd immediately beyond the gates O'Hara began: “In order to paint you my\r\nlife, Hogarth, I must give you at once to understand what has been its\r\nmainspring and secret: my passion for my Church--”\r\n\r\nHe paused, while his lips moved in prayer, and he crossed himself.\r\n\r\n“From boyhood my dream was to see my Church supreme in the warfare of\r\nthe world, I being a King's College and Maynooth man, at twenty-three\r\nwas Senior Chancellor's Medallist, and seven years later, sent to Rome\r\nwas quickly received into the Vatican household. It was recognized that\r\nI had a future: both gifts and graces; piety; a versatile tongue; a\r\npowerful voice; some learning; could dine, I could look august; above\r\nall, I knew my man and could talk him over. My great day came when, one\r\nmorning, in St. Gregory the Great on Mount Coelius, I was consecrated\r\nBishop Coadjutor to his Eminence the Archbishop of Westminster. Now\r\nI was on the heights. My life during the next ten years was a life of\r\nbustling action--and was led always with one unselfish object. No man\r\never spoke a greater number of words than I, Hogarth. I have breakfasted\r\nwith the Prime Minister, lunched with a President of the Conference, and\r\ndined with the Bishop of London: between the three meals I have written\r\na hundred letters and pitched into ten cabs. Such a life is very\r\nexhilarating, in comparison, for example, with quarrying. Oh, my God\r\nwhat am I fallen! Most of that time I was running over Europe: from\r\nMadrid to Vienna, from Rouen to Rome. It happened that the Archbishop\r\nof Paris was organizing a scheme of Church-workhouses in France, in the\r\nabsence of municipal ones, such as we have here.... Well, it was a grand\r\nthing, but was falling through for lack of funds: so I, on my way to\r\nRome, undertook the mission to plead the cause before his Holiness, and\r\nsucceeded to this extent that, on my return, I had with me a casket from\r\nthe good old man containing seven diamonds, which I might either dispose\r\nof personally, or hand over to the Paris fund. Now, it was during my\r\nstay at Rome that that series of events, culminating in the Jewish\r\nexodus from Europe, occurred; and on my journey home I was seized with\r\nthe mighty thought that, since many of the Jews were perishing of want,\r\n_that_ was the moment to reach their spirit through the body, and add\r\ntheir race to the trophies of the Church. Was it not a thought? You\r\nyourself, who are a Jew--”\r\n\r\nHogarth's eyes opened in surprise.”_I_ am not a Jew “.\r\n\r\n“No? I should have said that there was a hint of expression\r\nsomewhere--But to resume. I retained those seven diamonds, and disposed\r\nof them”.\r\n\r\n“Honest behaviour!”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly honest! I acquainted the Pope--he sanctioned it! And now, I,\r\nsingle-handed almost, threw myself into that task. I hired, I built, I\r\nbegged, I borrowed, I formed committees, I haunted Religious Houses, I\r\nsweated, I ran, I wept, I visited dens, I smoked opium, I drank gin,\r\nI framed memorials, I learned Yiddish, I read the Mishna and Gemara, I\r\ninterviewed Rabbonim, I wrote tracts: I was busy. In the midst of it, I\r\nhad to visit Rome ceremoniously, to assist at an interview between\r\nthe Duke of York and his Holiness--arrived on the Monday, and on the\r\nWednesday, I remember, attended a Court Ball in the suite of his Royal\r\nHighness. That night, when I returned to the Vatican, I found all the\r\nPiazza di San Pietro crowded. I do not know if you were free at the\r\ntime when my friend, M. Tissot, startled everybody by predicting the\r\ncollision of an asteroid with the earth? Tut, the silly being--he\r\nshould have known from the body's response to the spectroscope that its\r\ncondition was too friable to resist our atmosphere. But I never yet\r\nknew an astronomer not imbued with sensationalism they acquire a certain\r\nmegalomania from their intercourse with space. But, at all events, the\r\npeople, dreading the destruction of everything, had crowded toward the\r\nVatican. The Duke of Genoa, I, and some of the College of Cardinals,\r\nstood watching from a balcony; and very imposing, I remember, was the\r\nmoment when a glare appeared--I must stop--”\r\n\r\nThey were at the face of the rock, and the “halt” and “set to work”\r\n parted them.\r\n\r\nBut again on the final march back at 5.15 when nightshades were falling\r\nfast like snow, and the arm now felt the pick a load, O'Hara began his\r\nmuttering:\r\n\r\n“I was telling you about the asteroid”, he said. “Now this body, it was\r\ngiven out, contained diamonds in large evidence, and the mere thought of\r\nsuch a thing bursting in mid-air, and scattering itself about was, I--I\r\nconfess, a little fascinating to my mind. A man might let his soul\r\ngloat upon such a hope till he went lunatic with lust! I--I confess, the\r\nthought was alluring to me. Diamond, my son: lucid--But when the body\r\nburst, and none of it came my way, I drove it from my mind: in fact, I\r\nnever heard of a trace of it having been seen--hissed itself into gases\r\nin mid-air. Except in one instance--one instance.\r\n\r\n“When I reached Calais on my homeward way, stopped there a day, awaiting\r\nthe coming of Rouen, for whom I had nuncio communications, and in the\r\nevening went to visit a cottage where I had once been a great favourite\r\nwith an old fellow called Santé-you know those Calais fishers, with\r\npainted sabots, and ochred trousers. And 'What!' said I to Santé,\r\n'the nets already spread at this hour?' 'Nothing to be done to-day, my\r\nFather', he answered, and explained that he had attempted to pick up a\r\nstone before his door, and--it had burned him: he showed it me: it had\r\nthe appearance of a piece of ferruginous rock, stuck with pieces of\r\ndirty glass; and it had burned Santé on the midnight of the asteroid's\r\nscattering.\r\n\r\n“Imagine my excitement: 'The asteroid', I thought, 'may add fifty\r\nthousand Jews to the Church'. I asked Santé for the stone--Do you blame\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“That day two months I had the diamonds lying polished in a casket in\r\nmy house. My evil destiny, Hogarth, ordained that the casket was the\r\none given me for Paris by the Pope, the number of the new diamonds\r\nthe same--seven: and one day, about that time, the Vatican organ, the\r\n_Osservatore Romano_, published a dreadful article, hinting that I had\r\napplied to my own purposes seven diamonds entrusted me for Paris: the\r\nPope, just dead, must have left some record of his gift. My friend,\r\nbefore I had heard a whisper of the attack upon me, the casket, whose\r\nlid was mosaicked with the Papal fanon, was secretly searched by a\r\nsecretary in my house: the seven diamonds were seen.\r\n\r\n“Imagine the horror of what followed: I was abandoned by all--superior\r\nand inferior; the story of the meteor was received with sneers. The\r\nscandal reached the public papers--the public prosecutor. And here now\r\nis the wretch, Patrick O'Hara.”\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this narrative was fiction! The Pope's diamonds\r\nO'Hara had duly handed to the Archbishop! and though there was such a\r\nman as Santé, no asteroid had ever fallen at his door. In fact, O'Hara\r\nwas “serving time” for an assault upon a lady in a railway compartment\r\nbetween Whitchurch and Salisbury.\r\n\r\nBut Hogarth spent that night in meditating the pros and cons as to\r\nO'Hara's escaping; and, in a moment of destiny, said at last: “If he is\r\nundeservedly doomed--” and swooned to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe very next day was foggy....\r\n\r\nOn the march out O'Hara said: “Here is something like a fog. On the\r\nCarinthian Alps, where you have dense woolly fogs, there is a race of\r\ngoats, which--”\r\n\r\n“Would you like to escape?” whispered Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“_Who?_”\r\n\r\n“You”.\r\n\r\n“Hogarth--! My God--!”\r\n\r\nA trembling seized the priest's leathery left cheek, he at that\r\ninstant seeing a vision of the world--Andalusian wines, hued ices, the\r\nopera-house, and great greyhounds of the sea, and a snuff which his\r\ngross nose loved at Gorey.\r\n\r\n“Hogarth, you are not mocking me?” chattered the priest's jaws, hurrying\r\nlike a jarred spring.\r\n\r\n“I am quite serious. You will have to run for it though”.\r\n\r\n“_Run!_ I am not such a young man! Have pity Hogarth”.\r\n\r\n“Bah! Be a man”.\r\n\r\nThe priest approached his mouth to Hogarth's ear: “_I should die of\r\nfright!_ My heart--”\r\n\r\n“What would it matter? I thought you had more beans”.\r\n\r\n“But have you--a plan?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. You must run to the copse--”\r\n\r\n“I shall be shot!”\r\n\r\n“Probably”.\r\n\r\n“I _could_ not--”\r\n\r\n“Then, do not”.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, boy! Tell me, Hogarth...”\r\n\r\n“Within the copse to the left of the quarry there is almost certainly\r\nat this moment waiting a man who, as soon as you pronounce my name, will\r\nhelp you--”\r\n\r\n“You say _almost_ certainly”.\r\n\r\n“I can't see him, O'Hara. But I should say he is there on a morning like\r\nthis”.\r\n\r\n“_What_ a risk! _What_ a risk!” went the priest with lifted eyelids each\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“You cannot escape from prison without risk. But I, personally, would\r\nventure upon ten times as much, if I thought it becoming. There is,\r\nhowever, another risk: that you may not strike the part of the copse\r\nwhere he is. But near the 1 middle it is high--”\r\n\r\n“Why, it is nothing but risks!” whined O'Hara with opening arms.\r\n\r\n“You are not bound to try it. By the way--can you swim?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--I suppose so--yes”.\r\n\r\n“Then lift yourself to it, and risk it. I should, if I were you. Think\r\nof liberty, activity. Prick your spirit, grip at it, and spring it”.\r\n\r\n“Do you think I shall be shot?”\r\n\r\n“No! It does not matter! Crush your doubts, martyr yourself to your aim,\r\nand your aim will give you the crown of martyrdom”.\r\n\r\n“Well--God reward you--I will think of it--”\r\n\r\n“_Do_ it!”\r\n\r\n“I will!”\r\n\r\n“In that case, don't trust to your own eyes--_I_ will give you the\r\nsignal with my handkerchief--so: you keep your eyes fixed on me. Then\r\nrun, zigzagging. And tell Loveday for me to look after you, and not make\r\nany more plans for me. Good-bye, O'Hara! All this is very unselfish of\r\nme, for I lose my old talky-talky O'Hara--”\r\n\r\nThey parted at the rock, and set to work.\r\n\r\nAs minutes, half-hours passed, the condition of O'Hara became piteous,\r\nhideous. His knees knocked together. Like death he dreaded, like life\r\nawaited, that signal. He said to himself: “This Hogarth will be my\r\nruin...God deal not with me after my sins...!”\r\n\r\nHogarth was waiting that the warders' morning watchfulness might yield\r\nto the influence of use and time; but near nine, when the morning fog\r\nshowed signs of thinning, he approached the water-can to ask for a\r\ndrink, O'Hara being then two yards from him, wheeling a barrow.\r\n\r\nAs he stooped to the water, his huge stare ranged the moor, took in the\r\ntruth of it, and, after waiting ten, fifteen seconds, he upset the can.\r\nAs two officers, at the outcry, ran toward the spot, Hogarth, his eyes\r\nfixed upon them, waited--and all at once, with a flourish, drew his\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\nO'Hara, with a heavy but impassioned run, was away...\r\n\r\nHe had not run five yards when a chorus of whistles was shrilling.\r\n\r\nAnd quick, that monotony reels into a very frenzy of sensation: it is no\r\nmore the same world, the same men. Lo, in the Palace of Continuity is an\r\nEvent.\r\n\r\n33 was off.\r\n\r\nFive hundred pairs of eyes lit up, and the flurried warders ran in\r\nrandom dismay to see to it! How if all the five hundred should do\r\nthe like, simultaneously?--a possibility underlying, through all its\r\nbreadth, the little social “system” which has produced Colmoor.\r\n\r\nBut the five hundred, exhorted, stamped at, shouted at, remained quiet,\r\nthough restive, only the wild eye showing the wild thought, while two\r\nof the warders pursued O'Hara who had also to run the blockade of two\r\npickets of the civil guard.\r\n\r\nThe escaping convict, however, has this advantage: that his mind is\r\nstrung to a far higher pitch than his pursuers'; and, given a certain\r\necstasy, everything can be accomplished.\r\n\r\nSo O'Hara separately dodged the two pickets, and was making bolt for the\r\ncopse before three rifles, aimed at a large vague ghost, rang out, and\r\ndid not hit. He plunged madly into the brambly bush.\r\n\r\nImmediately a bleating like a child's trumpet was heard from its midst;\r\nand in a few seconds, not one, but _four_, men were seen to rush toward\r\nthe river, all in convict knickerbockers, stockings, caps, all in black\r\novercoats: and one carried a bundle.\r\n\r\nBeyond the river one was shot in the leg--a black sailor, who, with two\r\nroughs, had undertaken the risk for lucre. The rest escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nTHE ROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after this Hogarth was taken with vomitings, his heart retching at\r\nColmoor. His dark cheeks jaundiced; those mobile nostrils of his small\r\nbony nose yawned, like an exhausted horse's; his face was all a light of\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nWhether or not some suspicion of his complicity with O'Hara had occurred\r\nto the authorities, he now found himself transferred to another “graft”:\r\nfrom quarrying was set to trenching.\r\n\r\nFour things are inexhaustible in the earth: the hope of a gambler; the\r\nsea; the lip of a lover; and the capacity of Colmoor to be trenched and\r\nquarried.\r\n\r\nAnd in Hogarth's new gang was--Fred Bates.\r\n\r\nOne day, Hogarth, intent upon his work, heard a sob and, glancing, saw\r\nthat Bates had dropped his spade and buried his face in his hands.\r\n\r\n“What, Fred, not giving in?” He went quickly and pressed his palm on\r\nBates' brow, saying: “Patience! Stiffen your back: look how _I_ slip\r\ninto it!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, Hogarth, you don't know. I am an innocent man”.\r\n\r\n“So am I.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but _I_ was certain in my own mind to be out within anyway, six\r\nmonths; _you_ wasn't. That makes a difference, don't it? That touches\r\nthe nerve, don't it? Ah!”\r\n\r\n“And how did you expect to be out?”\r\n\r\n“I had a brother-Bob-in the 9th Lancers in Punjab and his regiment was\r\nordered home just a week before I was arrested. Well, the morning after\r\nthe missus was killed, I went early--for I knew I'd soon be arrested--to\r\na stableman at Beccles--you know old Harris--and I made him swear to\r\ngive a letter to Bob the moment Bob put foot in Southampton, and\r\nto nobody else. In the letter I told Bob where he was to look for\r\nso-and-so, and how he was to prove my innocence--”\r\n\r\n“But I don't understand a word of what you are saying”, interrupted\r\nHogarth.\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you. I did not kill my Kit. The burn on her face, and on my\r\nhand, wasn't any red-hot poker. Did you ever hear such bosh? Look here,\r\nyou mind, don't you, the talk that week about the world getting blowed\r\nup by some comet? Well, about 3 P.M. on the comet day, as I was walking\r\nhome through Lagden Dip, an old gent, the same as took the farm over\r\nafter you, he comes up to me, and he says: 'If you should happen to see\r\nanywhere in your travels', sez 'e, laughin' and rubbin' his hands, 'a\r\npiece of hot iron after eleven to-night, you bring it to me, and I'll\r\nput a cheque for One Thousand Pounds there in the middle of your palm'.\r\nWell--I said it was a Wednesday, didn't I? And Wednesday bein' the\r\npay-day on the Eastern, me and the missus had a drop o' beer that\r\nafternoon, and you know 'ow you come and catched me a-paying of\r\nher--dirty dog that I was those days. But, Hogarth, you hadn't hardly\r\ngone when we made it up between us, and the rest of that evening we was\r\njust like--well--two bloomin', cooin' doves! kissin', blubblin', havin'\r\ndrinks, and doin' our week's shoppin' together. Well--stop, here's\r\nBlack--”\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted, and for two days found no other chance.\r\n\r\nTwo days during which Hogarth received another letter from Loveday, of\r\nwhich one paragraph was as follows: “The fifteen pounds which you left\r\nin Lloyd's Bank I have managed to withdraw for you on the authority of\r\nyour aunt, Miss Sarah Hogarth”, and at once he scented a cypher, having\r\nno fifteen pounds, and no aunt.\r\n\r\nWhen he had unravelled it as before, he had: “Why you failed?\r\nExpect--Balloon--Rope”.\r\n\r\nHe was astounded: and could only conclude that O'Hara had not delivered\r\nhis message.\r\n\r\nAnd as the image of O'Hara had mixed itself with his thoughts of the\r\ncopse, so now the image of Fred Bates mixed itself with the balloon.\r\n\r\nIt was partly through _his_ evidence that Bates was here...!\r\n\r\nOn the third day Bates, as though he had just left off, resumed his\r\nstory:\r\n\r\n“You know Seely's, the general shop, at Priddlestone”, said he; “it was\r\nthere we always did our Wednesday-night marketin'--nobody would believe\r\nwhat high old jinks those Wednesday pay-days was to us Great Eastern\r\nblokes! By the time we reached Priddlestone, we had a quart of four-ale\r\ndown us, let alone what we'd had before, and, as the saying is, one\r\nglass leads to another. By now we was feeling just nicely, thank you,\r\nand instead of going to Seely's, we took a short cut to 'The Broom', and\r\nit was going on for past eleven when we found ourselves in--you know the\r\nbeechwood between Priddlestone and Thring--she singing all the time with\r\nher head thrown back, at the top of her voice.\r\n\r\n“Hogarth, it gives me the creeps to think of! Suddenly it looked as if\r\nthe whole wood was lit up: there was the sky all cut up with streamers,\r\nI saw my Kit quite plain, then all at once there was a whishin' and a\r\nrushin' among the trees, like steam--and I saw my Kit drop smack. In two\r\nticks my head was sober: but, as I ran to her, I staggered sideways upon\r\nmy left hand, and I let such a _yell_ out of me--had put my hand upon\r\nsomething flamin' hot.\r\n\r\n“The minute I bent over my old woman I knew she was a deader; and I\r\ndropped down, and I called of her, and I shook of her, and it was quite\r\ntwo hours before I come to myself properly, by which time the affair\r\nwhat struck her down was gone out in darkness. Of course, the first\r\nthing I thought of was the old gent at Lagden. 'This should mean a cool\r\nthou', says I to myself. But I knew I should be arrested first thing in\r\nthe morning, except I told plain out what had happened: and that, you\r\nbet, I didn't mean to do, for if once I mentioned that there piece of\r\niron before I had it safe off the lord-o'-the-manor's land, I knew it\r\n'ud be taken from me. But to take it off before another day or two was\r\nout of the question--it was too hot. So says I to myself: 'I'll _get_\r\nconvicted; and to-night I'll write a letter to Bob, telling him where\r\nto find the affair, how to get the thou, and _after_ he's got it, how to\r\nset about gettin' the case retried '.\r\n\r\n“Well, so said, so done. You know that old elm in the beech-wood? I dug\r\na grave at the foot of it, and managed to kick and roll the affair into\r\nthe grave, then I took up my Kit, carried her home, and by the time I\r\npegged out the letter to Bob, I saw day breakin'. So I made paces for\r\nBeccles, knocked up old Harris, and gave him the letter for Bob. By\r\neight o'clock I was arrested--”\r\n\r\nAt this point the 5.15 recall-bell rang out, and there was falling into\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe next time that they had speech together, Hogarth said: “And were you\r\nsuch a clown, Fred Bates, as to imperil your life for a paltry thousand\r\npounds?”\r\n\r\n“_Paltry_ thousand pounds?” answered Bates, surprised: “Hark at this!\r\nDidn't I peril my life ten times more in Egypt for a bob a day? I tell\r\nyou I was certain in my own mind of getting out in a few weeks!”\r\n\r\n“Well, what happened to prevent you?”\r\n\r\n“Only this: Bob died on the troop-ship coming home; that's all”.\r\n\r\n“But you could write old Harris to open your letter to Bob, and act on\r\nit, or else hand it over to your father”.\r\n\r\n“My word, but haven't I wrote? Old 'Arris is either dead and buried, or\r\ngorn away, or somethin'. I've waited a year and nine months--good God!\r\nand no answer yet”.\r\n\r\n“Poor Fred! I could weep blood for you. Believe in God!”\r\n\r\n“More Devil than God about Colmoor, it strikes me”.\r\n\r\n“As though _you_ knew! Suppose I strike you blind--_now_--with a flash\r\nof Him?”\r\n\r\n“I don't take your meaning, sir”, said Bates, with a strange heart-bound\r\nand sense of awe.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember 33 of the quarry-gang, Fred?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”.\r\n\r\nHogarth whispered: “It was _I_ who got him off”.\r\n\r\nBates whitened to the lips. “I--I thought as much”.\r\n\r\n“There is yet another chance, which _you_, if you like, may take”.\r\n\r\nBates saw heaven opening; but with this vague hope was left two days.\r\n\r\nOn the third, Hogarth explained what he assumed to be the new plan of\r\nLoveday.\r\n\r\n“I take it”, he said, “that he will pass over the moor in a balloon\r\ntrailing a rope, which will have a loop to be slipped under the arms. I\r\ntell you, there are dangers in this scheme: you may be shot. Are you for\r\ntrying it?”\r\n\r\n“Trying it, aye”, said Bates, with fifty times the boldness of O'Hara.\r\n\r\nAnd now began for these two a painfulness of waiting days, the sleep of\r\nboth, meanwhile, being one nightmare of confused affrights, balloons and\r\ndeliriums.\r\n\r\nTen times they re-discussed every possibility of the scheme, Hogarth\r\ngiving messages for Loveday, heaping counsels upon Bates. Nothing\r\nremained to be said, and still the days passed over the time-worn\r\nhearts, till a month went by.\r\n\r\nAt last something was observed in the sky--afar to the N.W.--in the\r\nafternoon turn, about two o'clock, a mist on the moor, but the sky\r\nalmost cloudless.\r\n\r\nWhereupon Hogarth, who first saw the object, stepped, as if looking\r\nfor something, close to Bates, hissing: “_Goodbye!_ Keep cool--choose\r\nwell--”\r\n\r\nBates shovelled on steadily, as though this was a day like others; but\r\ntwice his knees gave and bent beneath him; and there was a twitching of\r\nthe livid under-lip, piteous to see.\r\n\r\nIt drew nearer, that silent needle, while Bates worked, delving,\r\nbarrowing, making little trips; plenty of time; and no one noted his lip\r\nwhich pulled and twitched.\r\n\r\nWithout visible motion it came, wafted on the breaths of high heaven:\r\nhalf an hour--and still it was remote, fifteen hundred feet up. Bates\r\nand Hogarth peered to see a rope, but could none.\r\n\r\nAfter fifty minutes it was actually over the moor, all now conscious of\r\nit; but the rope was indistinguishable from the air.\r\n\r\nYet it was there, walking the ground, at its end a horizontal\r\nstaff....Hogarth, with wiser forethought than Loveday's, had predicted,\r\nnot a staff, but a loop.\r\n\r\nIt passed twenty yards from the quarry, Loveday no doubt imagining that\r\nHogarth still worked there; but the quarry was some hundred and fifty\r\nyards from the trench.\r\n\r\nIts course, nevertheless was toward the trench: and on walked\r\ndeliberately the fluctuating rope, the staff now travelling the gorsey\r\nground, now bounding like a kangaroo yards high, to come down once more\r\nyonder.\r\n\r\nA moment came when Hogarth, with intense hiss, was whispering to\r\nhimself: “If I were he, I should dash _now_”.\r\n\r\nBut Fred Bates did not move.\r\n\r\nHogarth suffered agonies not less excruciating than the rack.\r\n\r\n“Oh, whyever does he wait?” he groaned.\r\n\r\nBut now--all suddenly--it was known, it was felt, deep in five hundred\r\necstatic hearts, that a convict was gone--a man overboard--a soul in the\r\nagony--battling between life and death.\r\n\r\nLike tempests the whistles split the air.\r\n\r\nWhere is he? Who is he? What mother bare him? It is 57! And he is\r\n_there!_--on high--caught, to the skies.\r\n\r\nThe tumbling of four ballast bags from the balloon was marked: the\r\nballoon darted high, wildly high; and with her, seated on the bar, the\r\ncord between his thighs, darted high Fred Bates.\r\n\r\nExultant! the five hundred faces wax fire-eyed, each heart a flame of\r\nmadness. But yonder is Warder Black taking trembling, yet careful, aim:\r\nnow the report is echoing from the two Tors, the granite-works; and\r\nthat smoke no sooner thins than a whole volley of crackling musketry is\r\nwinging toward that dot under the clouds.\r\n\r\nAnd it was hideous--pitiful--the quailing heart waited and was still to\r\nsee the dot dissever itself from its rod: he had been hit: was in the\r\nmiddle of the vast and vacant air: and wheeling he came.\r\n\r\nA shockingly protracted interval did that fall fill up: the five\r\nhundred, gazing as at some wonder in heaven, did not, could not,\r\nbreathe: the outraged heart seemed to rend the breast in a shriek. Would\r\nit _never_ end, that somersault? Wheeling he came.\r\n\r\nIn reality it occupied much less than a minute: and now he is no more\r\nethereal, but has grown, is grossly near, attended by the raving winds\r\nof his travelling: is arrived. And the thump of his coming was heard. As\r\nhe touched the earth he jerked out circular....\r\n\r\nHere was a tragedy remembered many a year at Colmoor, and always with\r\nfeelings of the deepest awe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nOLD TOM'S LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fate of Bates filled Hogarth's mind with a gloom so funereal, that\r\nnow his strength, his great patience, all but succumbed.\r\n\r\nOne evening, while his broom lay stuck out under the notch of his\r\ncell-door in order that Warder Black might count him, he took his tin\r\nknife, and began to scratch over the hills and valleys of his corrugated\r\nwall some shining letters:\r\n\r\n     VEN\r\n\r\nHe was now, after long reflection, convinced that he was the victim of\r\na plot of Baruch Frankl's: yet in his heart was little rancour against\r\nFrankl, nor, when he wrote his “V E N”, was he thinking specially of\r\nFrankl--hardly knew of whom, or what. It may have been of the system of\r\nthings which had given to Frankl such vast powers over him; but, the “N”\r\n finished, he pshawed at himself, and threw the knife down. If something\r\nwas wrong, he knew not at all how to right it, supposing the world had\r\nbeen his to guide.\r\n\r\nBut a simple incident was destined to transform his mood--a letter from\r\nold Tom Bates, the father of Fred.\r\n\r\nAnd as hitherto we have seen him passive, bearing his weight of pain\r\nwith patience, after that letter we shall find him in action.\r\n\r\nOld Bates' letter was handed him three weeks after the scratching of his\r\nvague “VEN”.\r\n\r\n“DERE MISTER HOGARTH:\r\n\r\n“thise fu lines is to ast you how you er getn on, and can you giv a pore\r\nold feller ane noos ov that godfussakn sun ov mine hopn they ma find you\r\nas they leave me at present wich i av the lumbeigo vere Bad and no Go\r\nthe doctor ses bob wot you no was in the ninth lansers he dide comen\r\nhome so ive only fred left out of the ate. I rote to im fore munths\r\nagorne, but no anser, no doubt becos i cum to london soon arter, so no\r\nmore at present from\r\n\r\n“Yours trule,\r\n\r\n“TOM BATES”.\r\n\r\nThe old fellow, Hogarth saw, did not know of Fred's fate: Fred, the last\r\nof eight. He would find it hard to answer that letter.\r\n\r\nWhen “beds down” was called, his head was still full of one thought: old\r\nTom Bates; and he could not sleep; heard the bell ring for the change\r\nof warders; the vast silence of the prison's night; and still his brain\r\nrevolved old Tom.\r\n\r\nThe stealthy slipper of the night-warder passed and re-passed. Anon a\r\nclick of metal on metal, and the bull's-eye searched him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he remembered that visit to the forge at Thring, and the\r\npresent of herrings which old Tom in his guernsey, had brought.\r\n\r\n“Here--take 'em--they're yours”, old Tom had said.\r\n\r\nHe had just then, he remembered, been on the point of going into the\r\ncottage to examine his guns, when the old man came, and stopped him--a\r\nfatal, appointed thing, apparently. Had he actually gone, he would have\r\nfound the guns vanished, and would never have been condemned....\r\n\r\nAnd what was it that the old man had said about fish, and fishermen, and\r\nthe sea?\r\n\r\nHe bent his brow to it, and finally remembered: “The day's work of a\r\nfisherman gives him enough fish to live on all the week, and he could\r\nlie round idling the other six days, if he chose; only anybody can't\r\nlive on nothing but fish all the time”.\r\n\r\nWas it true? Yes! He remembered facts of Yarmouth....\r\n\r\nBut since true, it was--strange.\r\n\r\nWas the sea, then, a more productive element for men to work in than the\r\nland? No, that was absurd: the land, in the nature of things, was more\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nThen, why could not _all_ men procure an easy superfluity by one day's\r\nwork, as the fisher could, if he chose to live naked in a cave, eating\r\nfish alone? In that case the fisher could change some of his day's-work\r\nfish for the shore people's day's-work things, and so all have a variety\r\nas well as superabundance.\r\n\r\nAt the interest of this question, he leapt from his hammock, peering\r\ninto that thing, and his fleet feet were away, running after the truth\r\nwith that rapt abandonment that had characterized his hunting and\r\nfootball. This was clear: that there was some difference between land\r\nand sea as working-grounds for men. Shore people, like a shoemaker, did\r\nnot have for themselves enough shoes from even five, or six, days' work\r\non which to live in plenty for a week: and hence would take nothing less\r\nthan an enormous quantity of the fisher's fish in exchange for a pair of\r\nshoes, making him, too, poor as themselves. But since land work was\r\nas productive as sea work, and far more so, it could only be that the\r\nshoemaker did not get for himself all the shoes which he made, as the\r\nfisher got for himself all the fish which he caught: some power took\r\nfrom shore people a large part of what they made, a power which did not\r\nexist on the sea. That much was sure.\r\n\r\nWhat was this power, this inherent difference?\r\n\r\nHe could think of no inherent difference except this: that shore workers\r\npaid rent for land--directly and indirectly--in a million subtle ways;\r\nbut fishers paid none for the sea.\r\n\r\nSo, then, if shore folk paid no rent, they would have a still greater\r\nsuperfluity of shoes, etc., from one day's labour in six than the\r\nfish-rich fisher?\r\n\r\nSo it seemed. So it _was_--as with savages. He started! But one minute's\r\nreflection showed him that it was in the very nature of the shore to pay\r\nrent: because one piece of land was better than another--City land, for\r\ninstance--and those working on the better must pay for that benefit.\r\nCivilized land, therefore, was bound to pay rent.\r\n\r\nSo that the shore people could never have the easy superfluity of the\r\nfish-rich fisher--because land was bound to pay rent? And the fisher\r\nmust buy the shore things so dear with his easy-got fish, toiling, he,\r\ntoo, all the week--because land was bound to pay rent?\r\n\r\nThe wretchedness of Man, then, was a Law?\r\n\r\nHogarth, confronted by a wall, groaned, and while his body was cold, his\r\nbrow rolled with sweat, he feeling himself on the brink of some truth\r\nprofound as the roots of the mountains....\r\n\r\n“Land was bound to pay rent”: he reached that point; and there remained.\r\n\r\n“But suppose the workers on shore paid the rent _among themselves_....?”\r\n\r\nAt last those words: and he gave out a shout which begat mouths of echo\r\nthrough the galleries of Colmoor.\r\n\r\n“If the workers on shore paid rent among one another”--then they\r\nwould--on the whole--be in the very position of the fish-rich workers\r\non sea, who paid no rent at all, the nation--as a whole--living on its\r\ncountry rent-free: England English, America American, as the sea human:\r\nand our race might then begin to think, to live!\r\n\r\nIt seemed too sublime--and divine--to be true! Again, point by point, he\r\nwent over his reasoning with prying eye; and, on coming back to the same\r\nconclusion, hugged himself, moaning. At last--he knew.\r\n\r\nAnd away now with the dullness and lowness! That blithe and\r\nhand-clapping day! Good-bye, Colmoor! the daily massacre, the shame and\r\ncare. Men could begin--if in a baby way at first--to think, to see, to\r\nsing, to live.\r\n\r\nHe saw, indeed, that that would hardly have been fair business if he,\r\nfor example, had paid his rent to the English Nation instead of to\r\nFrankl, Frankl having bought Lagden with money earned. But he thought\r\nthat Frankl would hardly be slow to resign that rent, if once he was\r\nshown....\r\n\r\nBut if Frankl _was_ slow--what then?\r\n\r\nThe oblong of ribbed glass over his flap-table showed a greyness of\r\nmorning, as he asked himself that thing.\r\n\r\nIn that case--Frankl could be argued with.\r\n\r\nBut if he still refused?\r\n\r\nThen the question could be gone into as to whether that which is good\r\nfor forty millions, though apparently bad for Frankl, is not _forty\r\nmillion times_ more just than unjust, goodness being justice; also, as\r\nto which had the primary right to England, Frankl or the English.\r\n\r\nBut if he still refused?\r\n\r\nSuddenly Hogarth giggled--his first laugh in Colmoor.\r\n\r\n_That_ could be arranged....\r\n\r\nFor him, Hogarth, the great fact was this: that he saw light. Into that\r\nhumble cell the rays of Heaven had blazed.\r\n\r\nAfter standing motionless a long time, he dropped to his knees, and “O,\r\nThou, Thou”, he said....\r\n\r\nAn hour later, when asked by an orderly if he wished to see doctor or\r\ngovernor, he replied: “The Governor”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nCHLOROFORM\r\n\r\n\r\n(Captain Bucknill, the Governor, was making his morning rounds, when he\r\nheard that among the convicts claiming to see him was 76.)\r\n\r\nA little man, prim, snappy, compact: an army officer, with moustachios\r\nstuck upon him, to curve and finish him off.\r\n\r\n“Well, what is it, 76?” said he busily at the cell door.\r\n\r\nHogarth struck a hand-salute--his old habit on His Majesty's ships.\r\n\r\n“Sir, I wished to tell you that I have determined to escape from this\r\nprison--if I can”.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, now! This is a most refreshing candour, 76!”\r\n\r\n“I have said what I had to say”, said Hogarth. “You keep a sharp eye on\r\nme, and I, too, will keep a sharp eye”.\r\n\r\nThe Governor puffed a breath of laughter, turned on his heels, walked\r\naway, and that day spoke to three officials with regard to Convict 76.\r\n\r\nAnd during a week Hogarth lay deep, chained, in a punishment-cell.\r\n\r\nBut during its first four days he had invented three separate plans of\r\nescape, and had determined upon the one which seemed the surest, though\r\nlongest.\r\n\r\nWhen he again came up into the light, he was a marked man, under Warder\r\nBlack's constant suspicion.\r\n\r\nNow, however, his expression was changed: he no longer belonged to\r\nColmoor, though he was there. Sometimes he felt like shouting at the\r\nburden of his secret. In his impatience to proclaim it, he pined to\r\nwrite to Loveday--but now his punishment had lost him that privilege.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the problem was to get ten good miles beyond Colmoor: a hard\r\none; but his brain had already accomplished a task far harder: and the\r\ngreater implied the less.\r\n\r\nHis first thought, when he had begun to plan, had been Loveday; his\r\nsecond, that on no account could he permit Loveday to incur further\r\nrisk, or expense, for him; his third, that he might yet use Loveday to\r\nany extent not involving risk or expense.\r\n\r\nAt the next weekly “School” he sat near a Thames-works hackle-maker,\r\nwho, though he could write, was no scholar, and was laboriously spoiling\r\na second letter-sheet, when Hogarth whispered him: “Can I help you? I\r\nsee it's to your mother. I could get her a quid from a friend of mine”.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'm much obliged....!”\r\n\r\nThe laborious letter, after half an hour, had in it:\r\n\r\n“If you go to 15, Cheyne Gardens, the gentleman will give you a\r\nsovereign which he owed me for cutting down the elm in the beech-wood at\r\nTeddington for him”.\r\n\r\nNow, Loveday lived at 15, Cheyne Gardens, and had only to see those\r\nwords “_the elm in the beechwood_,” to scent a cypher from Hogarth.\r\n\r\nHe offered five pounds for that letter: but it was two weeks before he\r\ndecided upon the intended words: “Small chloroform--trenches--rock”.\r\n\r\nThere were several trenches, many rocks: yet one midnight, when a\r\nblustering wind huddled the bracken, and the prison stood darkling,\r\nwrapped in mystery, a lonely figure in an ulster was there; and under\r\neach of three rocks he deposited two vials: for the formation of only\r\nthree gave the least chance of concealment.\r\n\r\nWhat Hogarth's plan could be he racked his brain in vain to dream,\r\nguessing that prisoners, on returning from the moor, must be searched,\r\neven to the ears: Hogarth, therefore, could never use the vial within\r\nthe walls, and must mean to use it without--a sufficiently wild\r\nproceeding. But the finding of the vials, was sure: for the “rock” which\r\nHogarth had had in mind was one of those granite ones common on Colmoor,\r\nstanding five feet high on a small base; and one day he swept his hand\r\namong the gorse under it, and, with a glad half-surprise, touched two\r\nvials.\r\n\r\nThree days later he again swept his hand among the gorse, touched the\r\nvials, breasted his handkerchief, laid the vials on it, and presently\r\ncontrived to tie them together with a twig.\r\n\r\nAt his feet now was a wheelbarrow full of marl, and two yards off Warder\r\nBlack, waiting for him to roll the barrow; but, inserting his spade\r\nbetween a wheel and a side of the barrow, his back toward Black,\r\nHogarth, with a tug, bent the spade: then walked to Black.\r\n\r\n“Look here”, he said, “that spade isn't much good now....”\r\n\r\nBlack strode to look, Hogarth a little behind him: and at the instant\r\nwhen the officer was a-stoop to lift the spade, Hogarth took the vials\r\nfrom his breast, and laid them upright in the little pocket of Black's\r\ntunic, near his bayonet-sheath and cartridge-box, above the belt.\r\n\r\nBy the time the matter of the spade was settled, the great bell rang,\r\nthe gangs went marching over the old familiar level, up the old path in\r\nthe grass-mound on which the Palace stands, and so, in lax order, like\r\nshabby French conscripts, powdered, toil-worn, into the gates.\r\n\r\nThen the search on parade: during which, as Black busily searched him,\r\nHogarth said: “Search well”.\r\n\r\nThey were then led up to cells.\r\n\r\nAnd the moment Hogarth's door closed upon him, he put his skilly-can on\r\nthe floor, and, with one stamp, stamped it out of shape; also he broke\r\nhis cup, and pocketed two fragments of it.\r\n\r\nA few minutes afterwards, before cocoa, Black, trotting in heavy haste\r\nhere and there in the gallery, looked in to say: “Bath to-night”.\r\n\r\nAnd Hogarth: “Warder! a word with you! sorry, I have trodden on my\r\ncan....”\r\n\r\nUpon which Black went stooping to look, the can now standing on the low\r\nshelf; and as he said “I shall report this”, Hogarth, stooping, with\r\nquick deftness had the vials picked from the thick pocket.\r\n\r\n“Well, fall in”, said Black to him; “better take your precious can, and\r\ngive it to a bath-room warder for the store-keeper to change”.\r\n\r\nHogarth, as he passed out, placed the vials on the shelf over his\r\ndoor, where they were secure, since cells were never searched; and, the\r\nbathers having formed in single file, five feet between man and man,\r\naway they moved and down--away and down--lost in space, treading the\r\njourney of galleries, till, at the bottom, they passed up a vaulted\r\ncorridor, monastically dim, across a yard open to starry sky, and\r\ninto the door of a semi-detached, steep-roofed building, which was the\r\nbath-house.\r\n\r\nA row of thirty-five baths; a very long bench for undressing; in the\r\nspace between bench and baths three warders walking: such was the\r\nbath-house: all whitewashed, galvanized iron, and rigour; but for its\r\nold record of uneventfulness a scandal was preparing that night.\r\n\r\nOutside the door a fourth officer paced, and a cord within rang a little\r\nbell in one click, to tell when, the bathing over, the door should be\r\nunlocked outside.\r\n\r\nAfter giving up his can near the door to a warder, who laid it on the\r\nbench, Hogarth undressed slowly; got off his boots; and now had on only\r\nknickerbockers and stockings: he got off his stockings.\r\n\r\nAnd the moment his bare soles touched the floor, he felt himself once\r\nmore agile on the ratlines, larky for a shore-row, handy in any squall.\r\nLet them all come, therefore! He smiled; passed his palms down his crib\r\nof lean ribs.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious, why don't you hurry up there...?” an officer came\r\nasking, stooping.\r\n\r\nAt “there” he saw stars-and-stripes, dropped upon his back: Hogarth was\r\naway toward the door, while the bathers started with shouts, though in\r\nno bosom arose any impulse to follow, the bath-house being the centre of\r\na maze of twenty unscaleable walls, prison within prison.\r\n\r\nBut as for Hogarth, in such a dazzling flash did he dash toward the\r\ndoor, that he had struck down the second officer before the outcry of\r\nthe first, and had pulled at the door-bell before the third could cry\r\n_“Don't open!”_--a cry muffled into his maw by a cuff prompt as thunder.\r\n\r\nThis third man, however, grasped the fugitive by the middle: and while\r\nthe overthrown two were running up, and the key without seeking the\r\nlock, a short, venomous tussle was waged just near the door, till\r\nHogarth, wringing his naked body free, tossed his antagonist by the\r\nknees to slide into the path of the two on-comers; at the same time,\r\ncatching up his battered can, and smashing it into the face of the\r\ndoor-orderly, who now peeped in, he slipped through, and was gone into a\r\nyard, small, of irregular shape, and dim, with one wall-lantern, and\r\nbut one egress (except the egress into the prison-hall), namely a\r\nblind-alley between the laundry and carpet-makers' building on one side,\r\nand stables on the other: blind alley, yard, and all, being shut in by\r\nbig buildings.\r\n\r\nBy the time the door-orderly opened his eyes, and one of the inside\r\nthree had rushed out, Hogarth had vanished; and these two, shrilling\r\nwhistles to reinforce the bath-room guard, pelted down the blind-alley\r\nto effect, as they thought, a sure capture. But Hogarth was not there.\r\n\r\nBack they came trotting, breathless, rather at a loss. One panted: “He\r\nmust have run back into the great hall....”\r\n\r\nThe other panted: “He'd hardly do that--hiding in the yard still, _must_\r\nbe. There's that little nook....”\r\n\r\nThe “little nook” is a three-sided space in a corner, very dark, formed\r\nby one wall of the campanile, or bell-tower, together with a wall of the\r\nlaundry-house, and a third wall which shuts in the yard; the entrance to\r\nit narrow, and one looking up within it seems to stand at the bottom\r\nof a triangular well, split at one corner. It is not far from the\r\nbathhouse, and into it Hogarth had really darted; but when the officers\r\ncame peering, no trace of him.\r\n\r\nHe had, in fact, gone up the lightning-conductor, which runs down\r\na bell-tower remarkably high, Colmoor having been built during the\r\nNapoleonic wars for French prisoners at a time when the theory was\r\naccepted that a lightning-conductor protects a space whose radius is\r\ndouble the height of the conductor. The tower is a five-sided structure\r\nwith a Gothic window into which it is impossible to get from the\r\nconductor, because a corner intervenes, and it is a feat to swing from\r\nthe conductor to the laundry-wall coping, and thence, leaping up, to\r\ngrip the window: at each of which ordeals Hogarth hesitated, pierced\r\nwith chills; to his observations from afar it had seemed so much less\r\nstupendous; but in each case he dared, and reached.\r\n\r\nAll this time the can was between his teeth.\r\n\r\nArrived on the window, his arms out groping, he felt a slanting\r\nbeam--climbed it--found it short-mounted upon a horizontal one, all\r\nhere, as he had expected, being a chaos of beams, raying every way.\r\nThrice he sneezed low, and felt cobwebs in his face.\r\n\r\nAnd groping he went, seeking the great Bell of Colmoor, which he had\r\ndoomed, hearing sounds of the to-do, echoes that ran below, and the\r\nvague shout of somebody, till he touched the flat top of the bell,\r\nclamped to the swing-beam on which he sat astraddle; felt also that\r\nalong the top of the beam lay an iron bar; made sure that this was in\r\nactual contact with the clamps of the bell: and, no longer hesitating,\r\nset to work upon the can.\r\n\r\nTugging with his dog-teeth under the upper rim, he got a loose end, and\r\nwrenched the rim off; then, tearing along the solder, got the cylinder\r\nseparated from the bottom; and, opening it out, had a sheet of tin.\r\nAnd now, by the help of his fragments of cup, he set to hack-sawing,\r\nbreaking, tearing this into strips, no easy thing, in spite of the\r\nthin-worn condition of the can: but finally had six strips.\r\n\r\nThe edge of one strip he inserted under an end of the bar of iron on the\r\nbeam; then connected that strip with another by loops, slid again to the\r\nwindow, and there lay connecting the six strips by a smith's-trick, with\r\nskew loops, non-slipping, getting a tin string five feet long. He\r\nthen took the leap to the laundry coping, and thence the spring to the\r\nconductor, this being all the more ticklishly perilous because he could\r\nbarely see it.\r\n\r\nHanging away now from the conductor by the left elbow, he reached out\r\nthe right arm across the corner to catch the tin, which stuck toward him\r\nfrom the window: and he wound its end round the conductor, electrically\r\nconnecting the bell with the conductor.\r\n\r\nAnd now, standing with one foot on a staple below the tin, he twice\r\nsawed the conductor's soft metal with the fragments of cup, cutting and\r\ntugging out three inches of it, thus isolating the conductor's point\r\natop from its earthing; then he tossed the piece cut out behind the\r\nlaundry-coping.\r\n\r\nThis done, he listened, cast a searching eye below, slid down the rod.\r\n\r\nThe yard was at present silent, but as he moved to give himself up in\r\nthe prison-hall, five night-warders with bull's-eyes fell out, still\r\nseeking him.\r\n\r\nAnd as he knelt with clasped hands of supplication and bent bare back,\r\nlike a captured slave, they fell savagely upon him, and cried one:\r\n“Well, of all the idiots...!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT BELL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning Hogarth was not marched out, and near dinner-time was\r\nsummoned before the Governor. Here he stood in a cage of bars in a\r\nroom of “No.1” prison, devoted to prison-offences; and before him, at a\r\nlittered table, sat governor and chief warder, with the witnesses of the\r\noutbreak near.\r\n\r\nThe case was gone into, the report made: whereupon the Governor looked\r\nup and down the length of Hogarth, and suddenly gave vent to a laugh.\r\n\r\n“So, No. 76”, said he, “this was the threatened escape?”\r\n\r\nHogarth was now all contrition and hanging head.\r\n\r\n“I beg for mercy”, he said, with a little smile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am not your judge...Where were you when the officers were looking\r\nfor you in the yard?”\r\n\r\n“I was hiding in that little nook”.\r\n\r\n“Confounded carelessness on someone's part...And what cut and swelled\r\nyour mouth?”\r\n\r\n“I bashed into the wall in the nook” (The can had cut him!).\r\n\r\n“You must have been mad!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir”.\r\n\r\nDuring the next two weeks he had round his ankles a chain which, rising\r\nin two loops, was fastened to a band round his waist; and he was set to\r\nturn “the crank”.\r\n\r\nFinally, he was led forth to stand before the periodic Director, who,\r\nafter reading the report, turned to a volume of writing in which was\r\nHogarth's record: good--till lately; and the Director addressed him with\r\nsternness, which yet was paternal: he would sentence him to one month in\r\na punishment cell, to two months in chains, and to one dozen lashes.\r\n\r\nAnd two days later he was led to the flogging-hall, which, as he\r\napproached it, sent forth screams; the doctor looked at him and\r\nconsented; the Governor said: “Get it over”.\r\n\r\nHogarth stripped to the waist, his teeth chattering: but not with fear.\r\nOn the contrary, he felt a touch of exultation.\r\n\r\nThe wrists of his outstretched arms having been bound to “the triangle”,\r\nthe Governor gave the sign, the cat rose, and sang, and fell.\r\n\r\nSlowly up, and whistlingly down, rasping, reaping. At the seventh shock\r\nhe fainted: and thence onward had a long dream, in which he saw Rebekah\r\nFrankl in Hindoo dress and jewellery, and she threw at him a red rose\r\nblack at heart with passion, and her body balanced in dance, and her\r\nhands clapped at him.\r\n\r\nDuring the next month he tholed the cold of that same punishment-cell;\r\nand during the next was in his old cell, but in chains, picking oakum.\r\nAll this time, if he was aware of high winds by night, he was in an\r\nagony, till the next day the great bell rang its treble.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of February he was once more trenching in the open air.\r\n\r\nBut a fear had stolen into his mind: for the string of tin was not\r\nstrong, and the winds of the last month may have dislocated it. In any\r\ncase, he might have to wait a year, two, ten....\r\n\r\nOccasionally he would redden with suppressed and turbulent energy.\r\n\r\nBut on the 17th of March, toward evening, England was visited by a storm\r\nlong remembered, lasting three days, during which the poor prisoners\r\nwere comforted with rations of hot soup and cocoa.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fourth day when the gangs were once more taken out\r\nHogarth was hardly conscious of frigid winds or agued limbs: for three\r\ndays the great bell of Colmoor had not rung; and his ears were open.\r\n\r\nOf the prisoners, who, by practised instinct, get to know the moment at\r\nwhich it should sound, three presently straightened up, spade in hand,\r\nto glance at the prison: and suddenly heard--a sound.\r\n\r\nA dull something somewhere--from the prison? unless it was some shock\r\nof the wind...Hogarth gazed piteously into the faces near him...No one\r\nseemed to have heard.\r\n\r\nA few seconds, like eternities...Then he saw a warder look at his watch;\r\nthen--another! and--they glanced at the prison; and--they approached\r\neach other; and--they laid whispering heads together.\r\n\r\nThen--joy!--came five officers, wildly running from the prison gates,\r\ncalling, waving....\r\n\r\nAnd now he knew, and smiled: the babble of that lalling tongue was dumb.\r\n\r\nAnd the very next day, when the afternoon-gangs were marching out, they\r\nsaw descending from a carriage before the Deputy Governor's house a\r\ngentleman with a roll of diagram-paper--a bell-foundry expert, summoned\r\nby telegraph from Cardiff.\r\n\r\nHogarth resolved to act that night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nTHE INFIRMARY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cell-door clicked upon him, he commenced to work: first\r\ntook off his boots; then felt over the doorshelf for the chloroform;\r\nwet his handkerchief with some of it: then inserted the vials across the\r\ntoes of his boots, which were a succession of wrinkles, far too large;\r\nthen put on the boots again.\r\n\r\nHe then lay on the floor, close to the low shelf; and, pressing the\r\nhandkerchief over his mouth and nose, breathed deep, knowing that in\r\nfour minutes, when he did not obey the order of “brooms out”, his cell\r\nwould be opened.\r\n\r\nAs he sank deeper and deeper into dream, it was with a concentration of\r\nhis will upon one point--the handkerchief, which, if smelled by anyone,\r\nwould ruin all; and finally, as he drew the last gasp of consciousness,\r\nhe waved it languidly from him under the shelf; then, with a sigh, was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nHe had known that he must have about his body the unmistakable signs of\r\nan abnormal condition in order to sleep a night in the infirmary--which\r\nwas what he wanted. And thither, when shakings and the bull's-eye had\r\nsufficiently tested him, he was swung away, and the doctor's assistant\r\nsummoned.\r\n\r\nHogarth's pupils were hurriedly examined, his heartbeat tested; and the\r\nfreshman frowned, smelling an odour which, in another place, might have\r\nbeen chloroform, but here was pharyngitis; and he muttered, “Digitalis,\r\nperhaps....”\r\n\r\nFrom a table Hogarth was swung to a bed by two of those well-behaved\r\nconvicts who act as hospital-orderlies, and there two hours later had\r\nall his wits about him, and a racking headache.\r\n\r\nHis first thought was his boots--expecting to find them under his\r\nstretcher, and himself in flannels; but he had them still on, and also\r\nhis work-clothes, humanity to the sick in the first stages not being in\r\nthe Colmoor code.\r\n\r\nHe spent half an hour in stealthily tearing a square foot from his\r\nshirt-tail; then, weary and sick, went to sleep.\r\n\r\nWhen, soon after 3 A.M. his eyes again opened, all was still. He lay in\r\na long room, rather dim, in the midst of a row of stretchers which were\r\nshut in by bars containing locks and gates, and on the other side of the\r\nroom a row of stretchers, shut in by bars. At a table in the middle,\r\non which were bottles, lint, graduated glasses, sat a warder, with\r\noutstretched legs and fallen head: near him, standing listless, a\r\nconvict hospital-orderly, who continually edged nearer the stove; and,\r\nhalf-way down the room, another.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there were calls from the sick-beds--whispered\r\nshouts--apologetic and stealthy, as of men guiltily conscious of the\r\nluxury of being ill; but neither night-warder nor orderlies made undue\r\nhaste to hear these summonses. There was, beside, an octagonal clock,\r\nwhich ticked excessively in the stillness, as though the whole place\r\nbelonged to it.\r\n\r\nHogarth took off his boots under his blanket, and from them took out the\r\nvials; then, sitting up, commenced to call the warder, at the same time\r\nwetting the torn piece of shirt with some of the fluid.\r\n\r\n“All right, I'm coming--shut up!” said the warder, but did not come.\r\n\r\nSo Hogarth grew loud; and the warder, presently rousing his drowsy bulk,\r\nunlocked the gate of that compartment, as Hogarth said to himself: “Do\r\nit handy...”\r\n\r\nAnd as the warder stooped, Hogarth clapped the rag upon his mouth and\r\nnose. A struggle followed a muffled sob, both standing upright now, till\r\nthe warder began to paw the air, sank, toppled upon the bed, whereupon\r\nHogarth slipped into the blanket again, and called out in the voice of\r\nthe warder: “Come here, Barrows--see if this man is dead “.\r\n\r\nHe had now drawn the warder over him, holding up his chest with one arm,\r\nhad also poured chloroform upon the rag, and when the convict-orderly\r\ncame, Hogarth, by means of a short struggle, had him asleep, then seized\r\nthe warder's truncheon and keys, and ran out in his stockinged feet.\r\n\r\nAt that sight, the sick, the dying, the two rows of stretchers, were\r\nup on elbow, gazing with grins. To the second convict-orderly who came\r\nrunning to meet him Hogarth hissed: “Not a word--or I brain you with\r\nthis! If I tie your feet, you won't have to answer for anything. Come\r\nalong....”\r\n\r\nHe was an old fellow, and when he realized the impending truncheon, the\r\nmenace of Hogarth's eyes, and the silence of the warder, he permitted\r\nhimself to be dragged toward Hogarth's stretcher; and his feet were\r\nquickly knotted in his own stockings.\r\n\r\nNow again Hogarth ran: but not many steps, when he felt himself tapped\r\non the back, and, glancing in a horror of alarm, saw one of the two\r\npatients who had occupied with him his cage of bars--a wiry, long-faced\r\nCockney shop-boy, who had had his ankle crushed by a rock at the quarry.\r\n\r\n“Are you off?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“That's _my_ business--”\r\n\r\n“No, you don't. Part, or I give the alarm”.\r\n\r\n“What is it? Do you want to come with me?”\r\n\r\n“That's about it”.\r\n\r\n“But--your foot's sick, you fool”.\r\n\r\n“You'll carry me in your awms, as a father beareth his children....”\r\n\r\n“You are cool! What are you in for?”\r\n\r\n“Murder, my son-red, grim, gory murder!”\r\n\r\n“Guilty?”\r\n\r\n“Guilty, ya'as. What do _you_ think?”\r\n\r\n“Then you may go to hell”.\r\n\r\n“_'Ell_ is it? I'm _there_: and if I linger longer loo in it, you\r\nlinger, too, swelp me Gawd!”\r\n\r\nHogarth was nonplussed.\r\n\r\n“But the foot...”\r\n\r\n“Never mind the _foot_. Foot's still good for a run. Do we go shares?”\r\n\r\n“Come along, then”.\r\n\r\n“But you ain't 'alf up to snuff, I can see, though you are pretty smart\r\nin your own way: I'd 'ave felt the confidence of a son in you, if you\r\n'adn't overlooked that wine--”\r\n\r\nTo Hogarth's dismay, he turned back to the table, put a black bottle,\r\nhalf full, to his lips, and with tilts anc stoppages set to gulp it,\r\nwhile eager jokes, touched with jealousy, began to jeer from the beds.\r\n\r\n“Lawd Gawd, that was good!” said the Cockney with upturned eyes, “and\r\nwhat do I behold?--broth, ye gawds!”\r\n\r\nNow a saucepan of cold broth was at his lips; and not till he had drunk\r\nall did he run after Hogarth into the other arm of the ward, where one\r\nof the keys unlocked the door at its end, and they passed out into the\r\ninfirmary exercise-hall, now dark, Hogarth dragging the Cockney, who\r\nlimped, and kept up a prattle of tipsy ribaldries.\r\n\r\nThen, emerging upon a platform of slabs, from which the jump into the\r\ninfirmary exercise-yard is twenty feet, Hogarth leapt. The Cockney stood\r\nhesitating on the brink.\r\n\r\n“As sure as my name's 'Arris, you'll be the bloomin' ruin of me...” he\r\nsaid aloud.\r\n\r\n“_Sh-h-h_”, went Hogarth, “one more word, and I leave or knock you\r\nspeechless”.\r\n\r\nNow at last Harris jumped, Hogarth catching him, and they ran across the\r\nyard northerly, Harris complaining of cold, being in hospital flannels,\r\nhis feet bare, Hogarth bitterly regretting the burden of this companion,\r\nmeditating on deserting him. Accordingly, when they had run down a\r\npassage, and were confronted by a great gate, spiked a-top, Hogarth\r\nsaid: “I'll get up first”, and, forcing the small end of the truncheon\r\ninto the space at the hinges, he got foot-hold from which he caught the\r\ntop hinge and scaled, a feat of which he considered Harris incapable;\r\nand, instead of helping him up, leapt down with a new feeling of\r\nlightness, hearing from the other side “Dastardly treachery...!”\r\n\r\nAgain he ran through dark night wild with winds wheeling snowflakes;\r\nand, seeing in the unpaved court in which he now was a clothes-line\r\nsupported on stakes, he seized both, to run with them to where the court\r\nis bounded by the great outer wall: for though it is thirty feet of\r\nsheer rock, the mere fact of stakes being found there, and of a vanished\r\nrope, would furnish grounds for the belief that he had scaled it: he\r\ntherefore leant the stakes against it, and kept the rope.\r\n\r\nAbout to turn, he felt his back touched; and, spinning round, saw Harris\r\npanting.\r\n\r\n“There's a friend that sticketh closer than any bloomin' brother, Mr.\r\n76”, Harris said. “Try that game on again, and I give myself up; and\r\nwhere will _you_ be then?”\r\n\r\n“You silly wretch!” said Hogarth: “before I am free, there'll be a\r\nhundred difficulties and pains. Are you prepared to undergo them? You\r\ncouldn't, if you tried”.\r\n\r\n“Bear ye one another's burdens, it _is_”, said Harris: “with thee by me\r\nwhat need I fear? Lawd Gawd, that wine was good! it's got into my poor\r\n'ead, I believe. On, general; where thou leadest, I will follow”.\r\n\r\nHogarth looked at him, half inclined to knock him down, and half to\r\nshelter, and save.\r\n\r\n“All right”, said he. “Can you climb?”\r\n\r\n“Climb, yes, like a bag of monkeys”.\r\n\r\n“Come, then”.\r\n\r\nHe mounted three low steps before four doors at the north end of the\r\ninfirmary buildings, where, as he had observed from the moor, a spout\r\nruns up the wall at its east end; and up this he began to climb.\r\n\r\n“'Old on!” called Harris: “I can't do that lot”.\r\n\r\n“_Sh-h-h!_--you must!--come--”\r\n\r\nHarris made three attempts before he reached the first footrest, and\r\nthere stuck, vowing in loud whispers that he would no further go, and\r\nHogarth had to come back, and encourage him up. Finally, they went\r\nrunning southward on the leads between the infirmary roof and its\r\ncoping, and had hardly reached the south end when a whistle shrilled,\r\nand they saw a warder run across the exercise-yard with a lantern.\r\n\r\n“Stoop!” whispered Hogarth.\r\n\r\nCrouching, they stole along the south coping, and thence dropped to a\r\nflat cistern-top, Hogarth, with a painful “_Sh-h-h_”, catching Harris as\r\nhe fell, for the signs of alarm and activity every moment increased.\r\n\r\nUp a series of little brick steps, the base of a chimney over the\r\nkitchen--then across another stretch of leads beneath which is the\r\ntailor's shop--then, stealing in shadow under the beams of overhanging\r\neaves by a garret window, behind which was a light, and someone\r\nmoving--then a spring of three feet between two cornices--then a running\r\nwalk at a height of a hundred feet along a beading four inches wide,\r\nholding on with the upstretched arms--then, with course changed from\r\nsouth to east, along more leads--then a climb of ten feet up a glazed\r\nmain--and now they were skulking behind the coping of the great No. 2\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nNow, contiguous with the back of the bath-house is a wall which runs\r\nfrom No. 2 prison to the bell-tower, dividing the bath-house yard\r\nfrom the bell-yard; but the top is not horizontal, being lower at the\r\nbell-tower end, neither is it broad, and to reach it from the prison\r\ncoping a drop of seven feet is necessary: this Harris refused to do.\r\n“Not for Joe”, said he: “I've already run my 'ead into enough perils\r\nby land and sea on your account. If this is what you've brought me out\r\nmoonlighting here for....”\r\n\r\nHogarth did not wait, but disappeared over the side: and Harris, after\r\nfive minutes' pleadings, followed. They then drew on the belly to the\r\nbell-tower; and here again Harris refused the leap to the conductor.\r\nWhen finally he dared, and Hogarth sought to steady him, as he came\r\nsprawling upon the rod, both went gliding down, till checked by a\r\nstaple.\r\n\r\nBut they climbed again; Hogarth undid the half-fused string of tin from\r\nthe conductor, swung to the laundry coping, caught Harris, leapt to\r\nthe window, drew up Harris; and was ensconced far up among the beams in\r\nthick darkness in the belfry an hour before daybreak.\r\n\r\nAt this time the great gates were open, and the moor being scoured for\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\n\r\nIN THE DEEP\r\n\r\n\r\nThey had not been ten minutes in the tower when Harris began to whine of\r\nthe cold; whereupon Hogarth took off his slop-jacket and waistcoat, and\r\nput them upon the Cockney.\r\n\r\nAs from two sound-escapes far down near the bell some twilight came in,\r\nnear eight Hogarth descended, working from beam to beam, to find that\r\non one side the bell-metal had been melted into a lumpish mass, its rim\r\nshrivelled up, leaving an empty space under the motto _Laudate Domino_\r\n(mistake for _Dominum_) _omnes gentes_; and on the opposite side ran a\r\ncrack from top to rim. Sliding still lower on a slanting beam, he could\r\nlook obliquely upward into the bell's interior, and see the clapper, a\r\nmass weighing eight hundredweight, and so long, that quite down at the\r\nbell's rim were two hollows where it had constantly struck. It, too, had\r\nbeen blasted; but the bell-rope hung intact from a short beam at right\r\nangles to the swing beam; and, having found this much, he searched where\r\nhe had left the bottom of his tin can, and clambered back with it into\r\nthe upper regions.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven, lying along two beams, they could see the portal below\r\nopened, and four men came in, looking unreal and small; whereupon the\r\nleverage wheel was pulled, the swing-beam swung, the bell struck the\r\nclapper, and throughout the tower growled grum sounds: after which the\r\nfour stood talking half an hour, and went away.\r\n\r\nA little later--it must have been after the forty minutes'\r\ndinner-interval--about twenty convicts entered with two warders, bearing\r\nthree ladders. When these had been fastened together and set up, and the\r\nleverage wheel removed, they went away.\r\n\r\nIt was evidently to be slow work. Not till about four did a solitary man\r\nmount the ladder, and take stand, far down under the bell, gazing up a\r\nlong while, with stoops, and changes of posture. Hogarth thought that it\r\nwas the bell-foundry expert whom he had seen; but could only guess: for\r\nall here was dim and remote.\r\n\r\nBy now he had sawed the clothes-line into two pieces with the tin,\r\none piece eight feet, the other much longer--had intended tearing his\r\nclothes into strips for ropes, but the clothes-line was still better. In\r\nboth ropes he made knots for hand-hold, a large knot at one end of\r\nthe short one, and he attached the string of tin to the other end.\r\nDescending now, he tied the longer rope round the swingbeam, let himself\r\ndown to the rim of the bell, and with the right hand pushed the tin\r\ninto the hole in which the clapper swung, reaching up, until the tin\r\nover-balanced, ran, and toppled down beside the clapper; drawing the tin\r\nnow, he brought the rope down till it was stopped by the knot; and now,\r\nby a swing off from rope to rope, could climb into the bell. He then\r\nreascended, taking the longer rope, and the tin, with him.\r\n\r\nAs night fell, he judged that by the next he would succumb. Happily,\r\nHarris, who had eaten later than he, was snoring in a nook; but toward\r\nmorning began to whine again, and sulk, and kept it up all the day. Not\r\na soul now entered, and as the blackness of night once more filled the\r\nplace, Harris threw up the sponge, with “Here goes for this child....!”\r\n Hogarth flew across the space which divided them, and a quarrel of\r\ncats ensued, both being under the influence of the fury called\r\n“hunger-madness”. It was only when Harris felt the grip of Hogarth\r\nat his windpipe that he squealed submission, whereupon Hogarth threw\r\nhimself away; and half the night they sat, nothing but four eyes, eyeing\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThat night what was a revival of the great gale took place, belling like\r\nbucks about their heads, and noising through the tower in many a voice.\r\nThis so increased their sense of desolation, that even the heart of\r\nHogarth fainted, they like castaways on some ocean whose glooms no\r\nsunrise ever goldens; and now a doubt arose whether, even if the bell\r\nwere removed on the morrow, Harris would have strength to cling on\r\nduring the descent.\r\n\r\nHowever, early the next day hope revived when five men entered, four\r\nmounting among the beams to the swing-beam with tools, one at the\r\nladder-head shouting up orders; and Hogarth, when they had gone,\r\nwhispered Harris: “They have been unscrewing the sockets in which the\r\nbell-beam swings”.\r\n\r\n“Let them unscrew away”, said Harris, his chin shivering on his hand.\r\n\r\nFive more hours; during which only once did three men enter, seeming to\r\ndo nothing but talk, with upward glances.\r\n\r\nBut at three it was evident that there was considerable to-do, though\r\nabove there the row of the winds drowned all sound. A crowd, chiefly of\r\nconvicts, passed in and out; then twelve men, one after the other, ran\r\nup the ladder, and thence climbed among the beams, with six cables. Half\r\nwent to the east, half to the west, side of the bell; and three of the\r\ncables were fastened round the swing-beam near one end, three near\r\nthe other end; one three were then cast over a beam higher than the\r\nswing-beam, to the north of it; the other three cast over a beam to the\r\nsouth of it; and the six ends lowered--operations which Hogarth, lying\r\non his face, could just see; and the twelve had hardly begun to descend,\r\nwhen he saw a lorry backed into the gateway, filling half 1 the area\r\nof the tower; whereupon over a hundred convicts were swarming over and\r\nround it.\r\n\r\n“Now”, said Hogarth; and he hurried down, tacking his way with slides\r\nand runs among the intricate beams, tied the rope to a beam above the\r\nswing-beam, and let himself down to the bell's rim; reached out then,\r\ncaught the knotted rope that was within the bell, and climbed, the\r\nclapper now so rough, that hand and knee found grip; and he spent a\r\nminute in estimating his power of holding on with one arm, and with\r\nboth, to its support-shaft.\r\n\r\nAnd now he whispered Harris, and caught and half-sustained the Cockney.\r\n\r\nNow they could hear echoes of the tongues below; and now Harris,\r\nclinging alternate with Hogarth, arms and legs, face to face, by rope\r\nand shaft and clapper, whispered: “But-good Lord-look 'ere-there are\r\nsome people coming up!”\r\n\r\nFour convicts were indeed climbing: but even directly beneath the bell,\r\nwhere it was impossible to come, they would hardly have distinguished\r\nthe forms huddled in its dark cavern, and their aim was higher, to stand\r\nready, when the beam should lift, to swing it diagonally across the\r\nsquare of beams which had supported it, so that it might find space to\r\ndescend. And soon the bell-beam stirred at the tightening ropes: the\r\nfugitives felt themselves swinging, rising, poised--descending.\r\n\r\nThey were dizzily aware of shouted orders, the creaking of the toiling,\r\nslipping ropes, little jolts and stoppages, two hundred eyes blinking\r\nup, not seeing their cringed-up limbs--unnecessary cautious: for the\r\nnearer they descended to-ward the half-light, the surer did the area\r\nof the lorry make their invisibility. At last they were near; the bell\r\nlingered, swinging; babel was around them; the Governor's voice; a\r\ncheer: the bell was on the lorry.\r\n\r\nSomeone struck the bell with a hammer, there was talk, swarmings round\r\nit, then shoulders pushed at the lorry wheels, which squealed and moved\r\namid a still fussier babel drawn by four horses, and seven yoke of\r\ncattle. The fugitives could hear the opening of the great gate, the\r\nlaborious exit, and, in a moment's pause, again the Governor talking, it\r\nseemed far off, to the expert....\r\n\r\nWearily creaked the cart--beyond the moor--to a country road.\r\n\r\nNow chattering words came from Harris: “All damned fine! I don't deny\r\nthat you know your way about--”\r\n\r\n“Way out”, said Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“Yes, a gamesome sort of cock you are in all weathers...but what next?”\r\n\r\n“'Next' is to fall upon your knees and worship me, you cur”.\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt worship the Lawd thy Gawd”, chattered Harris; “no bloomin'\r\nfear! This is only a new kind of punishment cell. You've got me in; 'ow\r\nare you going to get me out?”\r\n\r\nHogarth believed that the lorry was _en route_ for the railway, and\r\nhoped to escape in the transfer of the bell; but that night lorry and\r\nbell slept in a shed outside a village _en route_ for the sea.\r\n\r\nAt four A.M. they were again _en route_, and at intervals during the\r\nday, opening their now feeble and sleep-infected eyes, could hear the\r\nhoots of the two cattlemen, the sound of winds, the rowdy gait of\r\nthe crooked-legged oxen, and stoppages for drink or rest, and anon an\r\nobstruction, with shouting and fuss. It was night before the waggon came\r\nto rest on a jetty, the elaborate day's journey done.\r\n\r\nThe fugitives were then deep in sleep, and only awoke at the rattle of\r\na steam-crane in action above them, to find the bell beginning to tilt,\r\nlift and swing; then they were on a deck; and soon afterwards knew\r\nthat it was a steamer's, when they heard the bray of her whistle, and\r\npresently were aware of blaring winds, and billows of the sea.\r\n\r\nHarris was for then and there crying out, but Hogarth, now his master,\r\nsaid: “To-morrow morning”; and they fell again into their morbid\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nWhen they again awoke, uproar surrounded them, voices, a heaven-high\r\nshouting of quenched fires and screaming steams; moreover, the bell was\r\nleaning steeply, they two huddled together at its edge.\r\n\r\nHarris began to bellow: but he was not heard, or not heeded.... There\r\nhad been a collision.\r\n\r\n“If you can't swim, better catch hold of me”, Hogarth shouted--“there\r\nwill be--”\r\n\r\nBut the earth turned turtle, and Hogarth felt himself struck on the\r\nshoulder, flung, and dragged down, down, into darkness.\r\n\r\nAfter an upward climb and fight to slip the clutch of the ship's\r\nsuction, in the middle of a heavy sea he managed to get off his clothes,\r\nand set to swimming, whither he did not know, a toy on mountains of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nExultation raged in him--a crazy intoxication--at liberation attained,\r\nat the sensation of warmth, at all that water and waste of Nature.\r\n\r\nBut within ten minutes it is finished: he shivers, his false strength\r\nchanging to paltriness, the waves washing now over his head; and now he\r\nis drowsing...drowning...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\n\r\nOLD TOM\r\n\r\n\r\nHe continued, however, to swim after his conscious efforts ceased:\r\nfor his body was found next morning on a strip of Cornish sand between\r\nGorran and Mevagissey, washed by every sheet of surf.\r\n\r\nHis rescuer, a shrimp-fisher, occupied one of three cots perched on a\r\nravine; and there on the evening of the second day he opened his eyes on\r\na settee, four children screaming in play around him; he so far having\r\nbeen seen only by a reporter from Mevagissey, and the doctor from\r\nGorran, who, on his wide rounds, had been asked into the cottage.\r\n\r\nThe same night Hogarth spoke to the fisher: told him that he was not a\r\nwrecked sailor, had reasons for avoiding observation, and would pay\r\nfor shelter and silence: whereat the fisher, who was drinking hot beer,\r\nwinked, and promised; and the next day took for Hogarth a telegram,\r\nsigned “Elm Tree”, to Mevagissey, asking of Loveday five pounds.\r\n\r\nFinally, one midnight, after two weeks of skulking, he reached\r\nWhitechapel, where, the fact of his brown skin now giving him the idea\r\nof orientalizing himself, at a Jew's, in a little interior behind the\r\ncounter, he bought sandals, a caftan, a black sudayree, an old Bagdad\r\nshawl for girdle, and a greenish-yellow Bedouin head-cloth, or kefie,\r\nwhich banded the forehead, draped the face like a nun's wimple, and fell\r\nloose. For these he discarded the shrimp-man's clothes; and now dubbed\r\nhimself “Peter the Hermit”.\r\n\r\nFor he meant to start-a Crusade.\r\n\r\nAt a police-station on the third day he saw a description of himself:\r\nthree moles, bloodshot eye, white teeth, pouting mouth; but over the\r\nmoles now hung the head-cloth.\r\n\r\nFor several days he lay low in a garret, considering himself, abandoning\r\nhimself to sensuality in cocoa, vast buns, tobacco: rioting above all in\r\nthe thought of the secret truth which lay in his head.\r\n\r\nUp to now, not a word to anyone about it; but on the seventh night he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\nIt was in some “Cocoa Rooms” in a “first-class room”, strewn with\r\nsawdust, where, as he sat alone, another man, bearing his jug, came and\r\nsat; and soon he addressed Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“Talk English?”\r\n\r\n“I am an Englishman”, answered Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“What, in those togs? What countryman?”\r\n\r\n“Norfolk”.\r\n\r\n“Know Manchester?”\r\n\r\n“I was there one day”.\r\n\r\n“Difference between Manchester and London, isn't there? I am a\r\nManchester man, I am. All the difference in the world. This cold, stiff,\r\nselfish city. Londoners, eh? A lot of peripatetic tombstones!”\r\n\r\nAnd so he went on; this being his whole theory of God and Man: that\r\nLondoners are peripatetic tombstones, but Manchester-men just the other\r\nway--seemed a mechanic, brisk-eyed, small; a man who had read; but now,\r\nevidently, down on his luck.\r\n\r\n“Then, why come to London?”--from Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“Looking for work”,--with a shrug--“looking for a needle in a bundle of\r\nhay. What would you have? the whole place overrun with Jews. England no\r\nlonger belongs to the English, that's the long and short of it”.\r\n\r\nHogarth looked him in the face. “Did England belong to the English\r\nbefore the Jews came?”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean? Of course it did”.\r\n\r\n“Which part of it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, all of it”.\r\n\r\n“But fix your mind upon some particular piece of England--some street,\r\nor field, that you know--and then tell me: did that belong to the\r\nEnglish?”\r\n\r\n“Belonged to some Englishman”.\r\n\r\n“But you don't mean to say that some Englishman is the English?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes, I know what you are driving at”, said the mechanic, with\r\na patronizing nod: “but the point is this: that, apart from vague\r\ntheorizing, a man did manage to make a good living before these dogs\r\noverran the country”.\r\n\r\n“But--a _good_ living? How much did you make?--forty shillings a week?\r\ntoiling in grime six days, sleeping the seventh? I call that a deadly\r\nliving”.\r\n\r\n“Well, I _don't_, you see. Besides, I made, not forty, but forty-_five_\r\nshillings, under the sliding-scale”.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but no brave nation would submit one day to such petty squalors\r\nafter it was shown the way to escape them”.\r\n\r\n“There _is_ no way”, said the mechanic: “there are the books, and the\r\ntalkers; but the economic laws that govern the units like you and me\r\nare as relentless as gravitation. Don't believe anyone who talks to you\r\nabout 'ways of escape'”.\r\n\r\n“But suppose someone has a new thought?”\r\n\r\n“There can be no new thoughts about _that_. The question has long since\r\nbeen exhausted”.\r\n\r\n“Well, come “--with sudden decision--“I will tell you a thought of my\r\nown “. And he told.\r\n\r\nIf the English people paid the rent for England to themselves--to their\r\ngovernment--instead of to a few Englishmen, then, by one day's labour in\r\nsix, Englishmen would be much more rich in all things than a fisherman,\r\nby one day's labour in six, was rich in fish.\r\n\r\nThe expression which he awaited on the face before him was one of\r\nilluminated astonishment; but, with a chill in his nerves, he saw the\r\nworkman's lips curve.\r\n\r\n“Bah!” said the Manchester man, “that is an exploded theory!”\r\n\r\n_Exploded!!!_\r\n\r\nHogarth was rather pale.\r\n\r\nYet he knew that it was true....Who, then, could have been exploding the\r\nAlmighty?\r\n\r\n“Who has exploded it?”\r\n\r\n“Been exploded again and again!” said the Manchester man; “of all the\r\ntheories of land-tenure, that is about the weakest: _I_ should know,\r\nfor I've studied them all. The fact is, no change in the system of\r\nland-tenure will have the least effect upon the lot of the masses; would\r\nonly make things worse by unsettling the country--if it didn't mean a\r\ncivil war”.\r\n\r\n“I begin to see”.\r\n\r\nHogarth got up, walked home meditating: and suddenly blushed.\r\n\r\nIt was known! by mechanics in cocoa-rooms!--that secret thing of his\r\nsecret cell. And it was not believed!\r\n\r\nAs for him, what was he now doing outside Colmoor? That question he\r\nasked himself, as he sat unsandaling his feet; and he commenced to dress\r\nhimself again: but paused--would first see Loveday.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the next night, the two friends met at Cheyne Gardens.\r\n\r\nAnd a long time they sat silent, Loveday feeding his eyes upon his\r\nfriend's face, that hard, rounded brow which seemed harder, and frowned\r\nnow, that gallant largeness of eye which seemed now wilder, and that\r\nmanly height, which seemed Mahomet's in the Oriental dress.\r\n\r\n“But where have you been for five weeks?” asked Loveday.\r\n\r\n“Skulking, and thinking. But about my sister....”\r\n\r\n“Do not ask...” said Loveday.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence.\r\n\r\n“Did not O'Hara tell you to make no more efforts for my escape?” asked\r\nHogarth.\r\n\r\n“Who is O'Hara?”\r\n\r\n“Why, the priest who escaped, instead of me, through the copse”.\r\n\r\n“O'Hara was not the name he gave me; and no, he said nothing about\r\nthat. I got him off to America, and only saw him twice. I thought him\r\nrather--But why didn't you escape youself?”\r\n\r\n“I thought it improper”.\r\n\r\n“But you did finally?”\r\n\r\n“For a reason: you remember the association which I was forming to\r\nanswer the question as to the cause of misery? Well, that question I\r\nhave answered for myself in prison”.\r\n\r\n“Really? Tell me!”\r\n\r\nHogarth absently took up a water-colour drawing from the table, and\r\nturned it round and round, leaning forward on a knee, as he told how the\r\nmatter was. Meantime, he kept his eyes fixed upward upon Loveday's face,\r\nwho stood before him.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his talk Loveday scratched the top of his head, where\r\nthe hair was rather thin, and said he, twisting round: “Forgive me-let\r\nme ring for some brandy-and-soda--”\r\n\r\nHogarth stood briskly up.\r\n\r\n“What I say, I can see, is not new to you?” said he.\r\n\r\n“No, not new”, Loveday confessed: “I believe that it is quite an ancient\r\ntheory; there are even savage tribes whose land-tenure is not unlike\r\nwhat you advocate--the Basutos, for example”.\r\n\r\n“And are these Basutos richer, happier, prettier fellows than average\r\nEnglishmen?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, beyond doubt. Don't suppose that I am gainsaying you: I am only\r\nshowing you that the theory is not new--”\r\n\r\n“But why do you persist in calling it a _theory?_ Is the fact that\r\none and one make two a _theory?_”--Hogarth's brow growing every moment\r\nredder.\r\n\r\n“What can one call it?”\r\n\r\n“Call it what you like! But do you believe it?”\r\n\r\n“It is quite possibly true; and now that you say it I believe it; but I\r\nhave never seriously considered the matter.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?”\r\n\r\n“Because--I don't know. It is out of my line”.\r\n\r\n“Your line! Yet you are a human being--”\r\n\r\n“Well, partly, yes: say--a novelist”.\r\n\r\n“Do not jest! It is incredible to me that you have written book after\r\nbook, and knew of this divine thing, and did not cram your books with\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nLoveday flushed. “You misunderstand my profession; and as to this theory\r\nof land-tenure, let me tell you: it will never be realized--not in\r\nEngland. Anyway, it would mean civil war....”\r\n\r\nAgain those words! “Civil war....”\r\n\r\nAnd as, for the second time, he heard them, Hogarth dashed the picture\r\nwhich he held to the ground, shattering glass and frame: which meant\r\nthat, then and there, he washed his hands of the world and its wagging;\r\nmeant also his return to Colmoor.\r\n\r\nHe dashed from the room without a word; down the stairs; out into the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nAs he ran along the King's Road, he asked a policeman the way to the\r\nnearest police-station, then ran on through a number of smaller streets,\r\nseeking it, till, at a corner, he stopped, once more uncertain, the\r\nnight dim and drizzling.\r\n\r\nHe was about to set off again, when, behind him, he heard: “Excuse me,\r\nmister--could you give a poor man a penny to get a night's lodging?”\r\n\r\nTurning, he saw--old Tom Bates: still in the guernsey; but very senile\r\nand broken now.\r\n\r\nThe fish-rich fisher...! he had come to this...\r\n\r\nHogarth had twenty-eight shillings about him, and, without disclosing\r\nhimself, put hand to pocket to give them all, just as the old man\r\nreached up to his ear to say: “It's the lumbago; I got it very bad; but\r\nit won't be long now. It wur a bad day for me as ever I come to Lunnon!\r\nI'm Norfolk born, I am: and I had eight sons, which the last was Fred,\r\nwho, they say, met his death in Colmoor....”\r\n\r\nAt that word, “Fred”, Hogarth started: for under the elm in the\r\nbeech-wood between Thring and Priddlestone Fred had concealed a thing\r\nfallen from heaven, which could be sold for--a thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nThat would keep the fisher rich during the few days that remained to\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nBut the old man could hardly go himself; if he could, would bungle: the\r\nthing was heavy--on the lord-of-the-manor's land....\r\n\r\nDo a kind act, Hogarth. He would see the old place, his father's grave;\r\nand there was a girl who lived in the Hall at Westring whom it was a\r\nthrilling thing to be near, even if one did not see....\r\n\r\n“Here are two shillings”, said he, in an assumed voice: “and if you be\r\nat this spot, at this hour, on Thursday night coming, you shall have\r\nmore. Don't fail”.\r\n\r\nAgain he ran, and took train, two hours later, for Beccles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\n\r\nUNDER THE ELM\r\n\r\n\r\nHis risk of arrest here, round about his old home, was enormous, and he\r\ndrew the Bedouin kefie well round his face, skulking from the station to\r\nthe “Fen”, northward, where he got an urchin to buy him a paper lantern\r\nin a general shop, and now trudged up to Priddlestone, then down through\r\nmeadows to the beech-wood, the night rough with March winds.\r\n\r\nIt was not the winds, however, which made him draw close his Arab cloak,\r\nbut his approach to the elm: there, one night, he had seen a naked black\r\nman! there had fallen the Arab Jew.\r\n\r\nHe stood twenty yards from the tree, till, with sudden resolution, he\r\nstrode, soon had the lantern ruby, and since the grave of “the affair”\r\n had been digged with a piece of wood, for such a piece he went seeking,\r\nhaving thrown off his caftan.\r\n\r\nInstead, he found the rusted half-blade of a spade, and commenced to dig\r\nround the roots, the lantern shine reddening a face strangely agitated,\r\nuncertainty of finding what he sought heightening his excitement: for\r\nthe earth showed no disturbance, and since three years had passed since\r\nthat night of Bates in the wood, the object might have been already\r\nunearthed. After an hour his back was aching, his hands dabbled, his\r\nbrow beaded, while the night-winds blew, the light now was commoved, and\r\nnow glowed a steady red; and still he grovelled.\r\n\r\nPresently, as he shovelled in a circle, always two feet deep, moving\r\nthe light as he moved, he saw on the top of a shovelful of marl--a twig:\r\nbarkless, black, cracked--_scorched!_\r\n\r\nTo an immoderate degree this thing agitated him--some whisper in the\r\nback of his head--some half-thought: he began now to root furiously,\r\nwith a frowning intentness.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly he shuddered: a finger seemed to touch his shoulder behind;\r\nand he twisted with wild eyes, caught up the light, peered, saw no black\r\nman--nothing: but quite five minutes he stood defiant, with clenched\r\nfists; then resumed the work, though with a constant feeling now that he\r\nwas being watched by the unseen seers.\r\n\r\nAfter two new strokes he struck upon something hard, and, digging\r\neagerly round it, found a quart-can, full of earth. And instantly all\r\ndoubt vanished: for this must have been the beer-can carried by Bates.\r\n\r\nStrong curiosity now wrought in Hogarth, a zeal to lay eyes upon that\r\nobject which had careered through the heights of space to find that\r\nbeech-wood and that elm-tree; and during fifteen minutes his little\r\nimplement digged with the quick-plying movement of a distaff-shuttle, he\r\nfighting for breath, anon casting a flying wild glance behind, but still\r\ndigging.\r\n\r\nNow, frequently, he came upon burned objects, twigs, cinders. Even the\r\nmarl had a scorched look; and his agitation grew to ecstasy.\r\n\r\nSomething very singular had happened to his mind with regard to this\r\n“affair” of Bates: Bates had said that it had fallen on the asteroid\r\nnight; and O'Hara had told him--falsely, indeed--that a piece of the\r\nasteroid, fallen upon the French coast, had had diamonds; yet, somehow,\r\nnever once had his mind associated the Fred Bates “affair” with the\r\nthought of diamonds, but only with the “thousand pounds” which Bates had\r\nbeen promised by old Bond. So at the moment when he had begun to dig,\r\nhis whole thought was of “a thousand pounds”; but, somehow, by the time\r\nhis implement at last grated against something two feet down, that word\r\n“diamonds” had grown up in his brain.\r\n\r\nBut diamonds! In the midst of his shovelling the thought flashed through\r\nhim: “The world is God's! and to whom He wills He gives it....”\r\n\r\nNow at last the thing lay definitely before him: he grated the spade\r\nfrom end to end, scraping away the marl; and it was very rough....\r\n\r\nThe size and shape of a man's leg, and red, anyway in the red\r\nlantern-shine--his sight dim--he moved and saw in an improbable dream;\r\nand when he tried to lift the object and failed, for a long time he\r\nsat on the edge of the trench, passing one palm across and across his\r\nforehead, till the lantern-light leapt, and went out.\r\n\r\nHe sprang upright then--awake, sure: they were diamonds, those bits of\r\nglass, big celestial ones, not of earth, in hundreds; when he passed his\r\nhand along the meteorite he felt it leprous, octahedron, dodecahedron,\r\nlarge and small: if they were truly diamonds, he divined that their\r\nowner must be as wealthy as some nations.\r\n\r\nAbout three in the morning he managed to raise the meteorite; refilled\r\nthe trench; and since it still rained, rolled the meteorite to the\r\nhollow of the elm, put on his caftan, and with his back on the interior\r\nof the tree, his feet on the meteorite, tumbled into a wonderful\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\n\r\nFRANKL SEES THE METEORITE\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was awaked by a footstep, and, starting, saw rocking along the forest\r\npath one Farmer Pollock, wearing now fez and tassel, and he saw his\r\nclothes all clay, and, with a smile of fondness, saw how, even beneath\r\nits grime, the meteor dodged and jeered, with frolic leers, in the\r\nbeams of a bright morning that seemed to him the primal morning, a fresh\r\nwedding-morning, swarming with elves and shell-tinted visions, imps and\r\npixy princes, profligate Golcondas.\r\n\r\nGoing first to the spot where he had digged, to give to the surface a\r\nnatural look, he trampled the lantern into the mire, threw the tin can\r\nfar, then, taking a quantity of marl, plastered the meteorite, to\r\ncover its roughness; then boldly left it, starting out with consummate\r\naudacity for Thring, where everybody, police and all, knew him well.\r\n\r\nA singular light now in his eyes, an evil pride; and he had the step of\r\na Prince in Prettyland. Corresponding to an inward majesty, of which,\r\nfrom youth, he had been conscious, he now felt an outward, and had not\r\nbeen awake eight minutes when his brain was invaded by plans--plans\r\nof debauchery, palaces, orgy, flying beds of ivory arabesqued in\r\nfan-traceries of sapphire, in which Rebekah Frankl lolled, and smiled;\r\nand on toward Thring he stepped, prince new-crowned, yet by old\r\nheredity, high exalted above laws, government, and the entire little\r\nmuck of Man.\r\n\r\nAt one point where the path ran close to Westring-park proper, the park\r\non higher ground, a grass-bank seven feet high dividing them, he saw\r\na-top of the bank in caftan, priest-cap, and phylacteries, taking\r\nsnuff--Baruch Frankl.\r\n\r\nHogarth skipped up, and stood before the Jew, having drawn his\r\nface-cloth well forward.\r\n\r\n“What's the row?” asked Frankl.\r\n\r\n“Could you give a poor man a job?”\r\n\r\n“You a Jew?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”, replied Hogarth, not dreaming how truly: “London born”.\r\n\r\n“A Froom?”\r\n\r\n“I keep the fasts”.\r\n\r\n“What you doing about here?”\r\n\r\n“Tramping”.\r\n\r\n“Fine mess you are in”.\r\n\r\n“I slept in a hollow tree down yonder--an elm tree”.\r\n\r\n“Well, there's many a worse shake-down than that. Who are you? Ever been\r\nabout here before?”\r\n\r\n“I was once”.\r\n\r\n“You put me in mind of an old chum of mine....Well, here's half-a-crown\r\nfor you to go on with”.\r\n\r\n“Make it a crown”, said Hogarth, “and get me to clean up down there; in\r\na shocking state with mast and leaves”.\r\n\r\nFrankl considered. “All right, I don't mind”.\r\n\r\n“I shall want a spade, and--a barrow”.\r\n\r\n“Go down the path yonder, till you come to the stables, and tell them”.\r\n\r\nFrankl resumed his musing stroll, and Hogarth ran for the barrow.\r\n\r\nIn twenty minutes he was again at the elm tree, and, with a scheme in\r\nhim for seeing Rebekah, heaped the barrow with refuse, pushed it between\r\na beck and the wood, till, wearying of this, he was about to get the\r\nmeteorite into the barrow, when he had the mad thought that Frankl must\r\nbe made to see and touch it, so set off to seek him: and a few yards\r\nbrought him face to face with Frankl.\r\n\r\n“Well, how goes it?” asked the Jew.\r\n\r\n“There is a weight there which I can't lift”, said Hogarth. “Then you\r\nmust do the other thing. Don't lift it, and you don't get the pay. What\r\nweight is it?”\r\n\r\n“It is here”.\r\n\r\nHogarth led him, led him, pointing. Frankl kicked the meteorite.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“It can't be a branch”, said Hogarth; “too heavy--more like a piece of\r\nold iron”.\r\n\r\n“Well, slip into it. A strapping fellow like you ought to be able to do\r\nthat bit”.\r\n\r\n“But suppose it's valuable?”\r\n\r\n“I make you a present of it, as you are so hard up”.\r\n\r\nNow Hogarth, by tilting the barrow, with strong effort of four limbs,\r\ngot the meteorite lodged, while Frankl, his smile lifting the wrinkles\r\nabove his thick moustache, watched the strain: then, with arms behind,\r\nwent his contemplative way.\r\n\r\nHogarth rolled the barrow toward Thring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\n\r\nCHURCH ARCHITECTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was already eleven o'clock, the sun shining in a bright sky, under\r\nwhich the country round the Waveney lay broad to the hills of mist which\r\nseemed to encompass the valley; yet, when one came to them no hills were\r\nthere, but were still beyond. When Hogarth came out from the wood upon\r\na footbridge, to his right a hand-sower was sowing broadcast, with a\r\ntwo-handed rhythm, taking seed, as he strode, from his scrip; and to the\r\nleft ran a path between fields to an eminence with a little church on\r\nit; straight northward some Thring houses visible, and north-east, near\r\nthe river, Lagden Dip orchard. Only two stooping women in fields near\r\nThring could Hogarth see; also, still further, a gig-and-horse whose\r\nremote motion was imperceptible; also the trudging two-handed process of\r\nthe sower nourishing the furrows. But for these, England, supposed to be\r\n“overcrowded”, seemed a land once inhabited, but abandoned.\r\n\r\nTo Hogarth the whole, so familiar, looked uplifted now, the sunlight of\r\na more celestial essence. Westring he would buy--though one memorable\r\nnight in Colmoor he had arrived at the knowledge that it was not just\r\nthat Westring should be anyone's; but then what one bought with his own\r\ndiamonds was surely his own--his name being Richard.\r\n\r\nHe had passed the bridge, when, glancing to the left, he saw a fifth\r\nperson in the landscape--a man under a sycamore near the church, gazing\r\nup, with hung jaw, at the apse window--dressed in a grey jacket, but\r\na clerical hat, and he had a note-book, in which he wrote, or drew.\r\nHogarth, whose mind was in weathercock state, rolled the barrow to the\r\nhill, left it, went stealing fleetly up, and gripped the man's collar,\r\nto whisper: “In the King's name I arrest you”.\r\n\r\nThe man's hand clapped his heart, as he turned a face of terror.\r\n\r\n“There is--some mistake--My God! Are you--?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”.\r\n\r\n“Hogarth?”\r\n\r\n“Who else?”\r\n\r\n“But you have killed me! My heart--”\r\n\r\n“Serves you right. Why didn't you give your right name to Loveday? And\r\nwhat are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“I was just examining this lovely old church, with its two south aisles,\r\nand one north, like St. John's at Cirencester. When the church fell in\r\nEngland, architecture was abolished--But as to why I am in Norfolk at\r\nall, I am skulking: and here is as another place. Your friend packed\r\nme off to America; but for some reasons I should prefer Golmoor--old\r\nColmoor, eh? I fear I am a voluptuary, my son, fond of comfort, and old\r\nthings, and pretty things. And all that I shall have yet! Tut, O'Hara is\r\nnot done with the world, nor it with him. As to Norfolk, I once knew--a\r\nperson--in this neighbourhood--”\r\n\r\nThe priest paused, regarding Hogarth with a smile, the “person” meant\r\nbeing Hogarth's mother; and he said: “But you are quite the Jew in\r\ndress: do you know now, then, that you are of the Chosen Race?”\r\n\r\n“Singular notion! This is a mere disguise”.\r\n\r\n“Ah. But you look quite radiant. You must have come into a fortune. When\r\nI heard of your escape, I said to myself--”\r\n\r\n“How did you hear?”\r\n\r\n“Why, from Harris”.\r\n\r\n“Harris is drowned”.\r\n\r\n“Harris is now under that little roof down there--there”--the prelate\r\nstabbed with his forefinger: “Harris is my shadow; Harris is my\r\nmaster. He was picked up naked by the ship which ran down your vessel,\r\nrecognized me one day in Broadway, and threatened to give me in charge\r\nif I did not adopt him 'as my well-beloved son'. Well, from him I heard\r\nall, how you called fire from Heaven--it was gallant. But aren't you\r\nafraid of capture down here in your own country?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot be captured”.\r\n\r\nThose stony eyeballs of O'Hara, bulging from out circular trenches\r\nround their sockets, surveyed Hogarth, weighing, divining him, while his\r\nbottom lip, massive as the mouth of Polynesian stone gods, trembled.\r\n\r\n“How do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I can buy King on throne, Judge on bench, Governor and Warder, the\r\nwhole machinery. Even O'Hara I could buy”.\r\n\r\n“I am for sale! Hogarth! I _smelled_ it about you, the myrrh of your\r\ngarments! And didn't I prophesy it to you years ago? What a development!\r\nThat beast, Harris, will dance for joy! Oh, there is something very\r\nartistic to my fancy, Hogarth, in the metal gold--brittle, bright,\r\norpimented--”\r\n\r\n“And diamonds?”\r\n\r\n“Hogarth, have you diamonds?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”, said Hogarth, smiling at the effect of ecstasy upon O'Hara.\r\n\r\n“Prismic diamond!” cried the prelate: “but how--?”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to enter my service?”\r\n\r\n“Do I _want_?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I want a tutor, O'Hara; and you shall be the man. Undertake,\r\nthen, to teach me all you know in two years, and I'll give you--how\r\nmuch?--twenty thousand pounds a year”.\r\n\r\n“My son”, whispered O'Hara, “what a development--!”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye. In Thring Street there is a little paper-shop. Come there\r\nto-night at seven”.\r\n\r\nHe ran down the hill: and as he went northward, pushing his barrow,\r\nO'Hara had a lens at his eyes, saw the meteorite, and wondered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\n\r\nFRANKL AND O'HARA\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Sturgess, of the paper-shop, a clean, washed-out old lady, held up\r\nboth averting hands at her back door, as Hogarth threw back his kefie,\r\nfinger on lips; but soon, her alarm warming into welcome, she took him\r\nto a room above, to listen to his story of escape.\r\n\r\n“And to think”, said she, “there is the very box your sister, poor\r\nthing, left with me to keep the day she went away, which never once have\r\nI seen her dear good face from that day to this. Anyway, _there's_ the\r\nbox--” pointing to a trunk covered with grey goat's-hair, the trunk to\r\nwhich the old Hogarth had referred in telling Richard the secret of his\r\nbirth, saying to deaf ears that it contained Richard's “papers”--a box\r\ndouble-bottomed, on its top the letters “P. O.”, with a cross-of-Christ\r\nunder them.\r\n\r\n“But, sir”, said Mrs. Sturgess, “you must be in great danger here. I\r\nhope”--with a titter--“I shan't be implicated--”\r\n\r\n“Don't be afraid, Mrs. Sturgess, it will be all right, and, for\r\nyourself, don't trouble about the paper-shop any more, but buy a little\r\nvilla near Florence, where it is warm for the cough--don't think me\r\ncrazy if I tell you that I am a very rich man. Now give me a steak”.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sturgess served him well that day with a pang of expectancy at\r\nher heart! Always, she remembered, Richard Hogarth had been\r\nstrange--uplifted and apart--a man incalculable, winged, unknown, though\r\nwalking the common ways. He _might_ be a “very rich man”...\r\n\r\nHis meal over, Hogarth threw himself upon a bed, to dream another\r\ntrouble of bubbles and burden of purples; woke at four; and, with a\r\nprocured cold-chisel, hammer, and a calico bag, went to the fowl-house\r\nwhere he had left the meteorite, shut himself in.\r\n\r\nSitting in the dust there, he set to chisel out the gems from the porous\r\nore, and as the chisel won the luscious plums, held them up, glutting\r\nhis gaze, scratched his name on a fragment of window-pane, and was\r\nenchanted that the adamant rim ripped the glass like rag: the whim,\r\nmeanwhile, working in him to purchase Colmoor, to turn the moor into a\r\nparadise, the prison into a palace; where his old cell stood in Gallery\r\nNo. III to be the bedroom of Rebekah.\r\n\r\nTo see _her_ that very night was a necessity! and when it was dark he\r\nset out.\r\n\r\nBut that plot failed: on presenting himself at the front of the mansion,\r\nhe was sent round to the back, where he received payment, and was\r\ndismissed; and when he again started for the front, intending to force\r\nhis way in, he decided upon something else, and walked back to Thring.\r\n\r\nHe reached the Sturgess cottage soon after six, ate, with a candle\r\nreturned to the lean-to to resume his work, and was still intent upon it\r\nat seven, when Mrs. Sturgess ran out to tell him that “the gentleman had\r\ncome”. He said: “Show him up to my room”.\r\n\r\nThe first thing which O'Hara noticed in that room was the goat-hair\r\ntrunk, with the initials and cross, the initials his own.\r\n\r\nAfter some minutes he furtively turned the key, dived into a mass of\r\nthings, paused to remember the whereabouts of a spring, found it, and,\r\nlifting the upper bottom, peered beneath; saw a bundle of papers;\r\nand, without removing the band, ferreted among them, and was\r\nsatisfied---Hogarth's “birth-papers”.\r\n\r\nHe presently went to a back window, and saw ruddy streaks between the\r\nboarding of the shanty, while sounds of the hammer reached him.\r\n\r\nHe would go and meet Hogarth: no harm in that; but it was stealthily\r\nthat he hurried down the stair and carried himself across the yard,\r\ngrinning a grimace of self-conscious caution, to peep through a cranny.\r\n\r\nHogarth's back was toward him, the iron leg lying near a box in which\r\nwas a sitting hen, on its top a candlestick, the calico bag, and a lot\r\nof the gems: at which the priest's palm covered his awed mouth, and with\r\na fleet thievishness, like a cat on hot bricks, he trotted back to the\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later Hogarth entered, nodding: “Ah, O'Hara...”; and he\r\ncalled down: “Mrs. Sturgess! pen, ink, and paper!”\r\n\r\nWhen these came, he sat and wrote:\r\n\r\n“I have escaped from prison, and come into great power. I summon you to\r\nmeet me at the elm in the beech-wood to-night at nine. I beseech you, I\r\nentreat you. I burn to ashes. Rebekah! My flames of fire! I am dying.\r\n\r\n“R. H.”\r\n\r\nHe enclosed, and handed it, without any address, to O'Hara.\r\n\r\n“O'Hara”, said he, “I want you to take that for me. Come--I will show\r\nyou the place. You ask in the hall to see 'the young lady': her name\r\ndoes not concern you; but you can't mistake her: she is so-pretty.\r\nGive the note to no one else, of course: it mentions my escape, for one\r\nthing. I know you will do it well”.\r\n\r\nHe conducted O'Hara, till the two towers of Westring were visible;\r\npointed them out; then went back, and in an hour had finished his work\r\non the diamonds.\r\n\r\nO'Hara, meantime, going on his way alone, muttered: “You go fast,\r\nHogarth: prelates of the Church your errand boys? But there is a little\r\nfellow called Alf Harris...if he had seen what I have seen to-night, you\r\nwould be a corpse now”.\r\n\r\nIn twenty minutes he was at Westring, which he knew well, for\r\ntwenty-five years before he had lived in the Vale: but he supposed that\r\nLord Westring de Broom was still the inmate.\r\n\r\nHe asked to see “the young lady”, persisted, and after a time Rebekah\r\ncame with eyebrows of inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe moment O'Hara saw her well, his visage acquired a ghastly ribbed\r\nfixity. Even before this, _she_, by one flashed glance, had known him.\r\n\r\nBut she took the envelope with easy coolness. And, instead of then\r\nreturning upon her steps, went still beyond, and whispered to two men in\r\nthe hall: “Do not let that man pass out!”\r\n\r\nAs she again returned inward past O'Hara, she remarked: “You might wait\r\nhere a little”.\r\n\r\nShe travelled then, not hurrying, down the breadth of a great apartment\r\nto a side room where her father sat, capped and writing; and she said:\r\n“Papa, the man who assaulted me in the train is now in the hall. As his\r\nsentence was three years, he must have escaped--” She was gone at once,\r\nthe unaddressed envelope, still unopened, shivering a little in her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nFrankl leapt up, rather pale, thinking that if the man had come _here_,\r\nhe must mean mischief; but remembering that the man was a gentleman, a\r\npriest, he took heart, and went out.\r\n\r\nO'Hara, meantime, stood at bay, guessing his exit blocked, while\r\nthe terrors of death gat hold upon him, the flesh of his yellow jaw\r\nshivering. But he was a man of stern mind--stern as the rocky aspect of\r\nhis face, and the moment he saw Frankl coming (he had seen him in the\r\nCourt), he started to meet him--stooped to the Jew's ear, who shrank\r\ndelicately from contact.\r\n\r\n“There isn't any good in running me down, sir”, he whispered in\r\nsycophant haste. “I pledge you my word I came here without knowing\r\nto whom. O do, now! I have already suffered for my crime; and if you\r\nattempt to capture me, I do assure you, I strangle you where you stand!\r\nDo, now! I only brought a letter--”\r\n\r\nFrankl, half inclined to tyrannize over misery, and half afraid, swept\r\nhis hand down the beard.\r\n\r\n“Letter?” said he: “from whom?”\r\n\r\n“From a friend”.\r\n\r\n“Which friend?”\r\n\r\n“A man named Hogarth”.\r\n\r\nO'Hara said it in an awful whisper, though not aware of any relation\r\nbetween Hogarth and Frankl.\r\n\r\nWhereupon an agitation waved down Frankl's beard. The news that “a man\r\nnamed Hogarth” had written to his daughter would hardly have suggested\r\n_Richard_--safe elsewhere; but, one night at Yarmouth, he had seen\r\nRichard Hogarth inexplicably kiss his daughter's hand.\r\n\r\n“Hogarth?” said he: “what Christian name?”\r\n\r\n“Richard”.\r\n\r\nThe agonized thought in Frankl's brain was this: “Well, what's the\r\ngood of prisons, then?”--he, too earnest a financier to read newspaper\r\ngossip, having heard not a word of the three escapes from Colmoor.\r\n\r\nHe said: “Well, sir, generally speaking, I'm the last to encourage this\r\nsort of thing; but, as yours is a special case, I tell you plain out\r\nthat, personally, I don't mean a bit of harm to you. Just step into a\r\nroom here, and let us talk the matter quietly over”.\r\n\r\nHe led O'Hara to his study; and there they two remained locked half an\r\nhour, conferring head to head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE BAG OF LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nRebekah, having excused herself from three ladies, her guests, alone in\r\nher room opened her letter.\r\n\r\nGlanced first at the “R. H.”, and was not surprised. He had “escaped”,\r\nhad “come into great power”: that seemed natural; but he “summoned” her\r\nto meet him, and she saw no connection between his “great power” and his\r\nright to summon her.\r\n\r\nShe held the paper to a fire, and, as it began to burn, in a panic\r\nof flurry extinguished the edge, and hustled it into her bosom; then\r\nperambulated; then fell to a chair-edge with staring gaze; then, rocking\r\nher head which she had dropped upon a little table, moaned: “He is\r\nmad....”\r\n\r\n“My flames of fire! Rebekah! I am dying....”\r\n\r\nHe suffered; and a pussy's wail mewed from her; but with a gasp of anger\r\nwhich said “Ho!” she sprang straight, and went ranging, with a stamping\r\ngait, through the chamber, filling it with passion. “I _won't go_!” she\r\nwent with fixed lips, as something within her whispered: “You must”.\r\n\r\nTo escape herself, she went again to see what had happened with regard\r\nto the convict, whose face would carry to the grave the scars of her\r\nnails.\r\n\r\nThere were no signs of any disturbance; and she asked a footman: “Where\r\nis the man who was here?”\r\n\r\n“With your father in the study”.\r\n\r\nThat seemed a strange proceeding: she felt a touch of alarm for her\r\nfather, and, passing again by the study, peeped; could see nothing for\r\nthe key, but heard voices.\r\n\r\nThis messenger of Hogarth, she next thought, was a criminal: he might\r\nbetray...so she stole into an adjacent room, to peep by a side door of\r\nthe study, and though a key projecting toward her barred her vision, the\r\ntalkers were near this point, and she could hear.\r\n\r\n“The diamond block”, O'Hara said, “is the same which he rolled across\r\nthe bridge this morning; to that I'll swear”.\r\n\r\n“Then it must be the very same block he showed me”, Frankl said in a\r\nwhisper; “that thing was worth millions....!”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly it was the same”.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but Lord”, groaned the Jew in an anguish of self-deprecation,\r\n“where were my _eyes_? where were my _wits_? I must have been\r\n_dreaming_! No, that's hard!”\r\n\r\n“Well--_nil desperandum_! Let us be acting, sir!”\r\n\r\n“My own land--!”\r\n\r\n“They are still safe enough: come--”\r\n\r\n“He may have lost one or two--in his excitement. Thousands gone! He may\r\nhave hidden some!”\r\n\r\n“Tut, he has hidden none”, said O'Hara; “we may have all. Let us make a\r\nmove”.\r\n\r\n“But he is a strong man, this Hogarth. Why do you object to the\r\nassistance of the police?”\r\n\r\n“What have the police to do with such a matter? Hogarth would simply\r\nbribe. And there are three of us--”\r\n\r\n“Who is this Harris?”\r\n\r\n“He is a Cockney--assassin”.\r\n\r\nFrankl took snuff, with busy pats at alternate nostrils.\r\n\r\n“What will you tell him is in the bag?”\r\n\r\n“Anything--rings--something prized by you for sentimental reasons. We\r\noffer him a thousand--two thousand pounds. And he will not fail. He\r\nstrikes like lightning”.\r\n\r\n“And we share--how?”\r\n\r\n“Come--let us not talk of that again, sir. What could be more generous\r\nthan my offer? You divide the diamonds into two heaps, and I choose\r\none; or I divide, you choose; and, before I leave you, you give me a\r\ndeclaration that it was by your contrivance that I escaped prison, and\r\nthat the gems which I have, once yours, are duly made over to me”.\r\n\r\n“And you collar half!” gibed the Jew with an ogle of guile; “that's\r\nabout as cool a stroke of business as I've come across. You don't\r\ntake into account that the whole is mine, if the concern fell, as you\r\nconfess, on my own land! And just ask yourself the question: what is to\r\nprevent me handing you over this minute to the police, and grabbing the\r\nlot? Only I'm not that sort of man--”\r\n\r\nO'Hara drew a revolver.\r\n\r\n“You talk to me as though I was a schoolboy, sir”, said he sternly. “Be\r\ngood enough to learn to respect me. I am not less a man of the world\r\nthan you are, and quite competent to safeguard my own interests.\r\nSupposing I was weak enough to permit you to send for the police, the\r\nmoment they had me I should tell of Hogarth in hiding; they would go for\r\nhim, and he, after bribing, may be trusted to take wing with the stones,\r\nleaving you whistling. Or perhaps you would care to tackle him\r\nin person? He would wheel you by the beard round his arm like a\r\nCatherine-wheel, I do assure you. All this you see well, and pretend not\r\nto. Do let us be honest with each other!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don't want to be hard”, said Frankl, looking sideward and\r\ndownward, plotting behind an unwrinkled brow, intending to have every\r\none of the diamonds; so did O'Hara, who already had his plot.\r\n\r\n“No, don't be hard”, said O'Hara: “_I_ am not. I give you an\r\nincalculable fortune; I take the same. Live and let live! Why should two\r\nshrewd old fellows like you and me be like the dog which, wanting two\r\nbones, lost the one he had? Come, now--give me your hand on it”.\r\n\r\n“Well, I'm hanged if you are not right!” cried Frankl, looking up with\r\ndiscovery: “Share and share alike, and shame the devil! That's the kind\r\nof little man I am, frank, bluff, and stalwart--Ha! ha! Give me your\r\nhand on it, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Ha! ha! you are very kind. That is the only way--absolute sincerity--”\r\n and they shook hands, hob-nobbing and fraternizing, with laughs and\r\nlittle nods, like cronies.\r\n\r\n“Stop--I'll just ring for a drop of brandy--” said Frankl.\r\n\r\n“No! no ringing!--thanks, thanks, no brandy--”\r\n\r\n“Well, you are as cautious as they make them. Oh, perfectly right, you\r\nknow--perfectly right”--he touched O'Hara's chest--“not a word to say\r\nagainst that. I am the same kind of man myself--”\r\n\r\n“Come; are you for making a move?”\r\n\r\n“Agreed. Where is my hat? I suppose a man may get his hat!--ha! ha!--I\r\ncan't very well go in this cap---”\r\n\r\n“You use mine--with the greatest pleasure. I do not need--Ah? quite the\r\nfit, quite the fit”.\r\n\r\n“Why, so it is. Ha! ha! why, it's a curate's hat, and--_I'm a Jew_!”\r\n\r\n“Excellent, excellent, ha! ha!”\r\n\r\nSo they made merry, and, with the bitter lip-corners of forced\r\nmerriment, went out, while Rebekah, who had caught a great deal of that\r\ndialogue, crouched a long time there, agitated, uncertain what to do.\r\n\r\nThat her father should coolly look on at an assassination for a\r\nfortune was no revelation to her: she had long despised, yet, with an\r\ninconsistency due to the tenderness of Jewish family ties, still loved\r\nhim; the notion of appealing to the police, therefore, who might ruin\r\nHogarth, too, did not enter her head.\r\n\r\nShe ran and wrote: “Your life and bag of gems are _at this moment_ in\r\ndanger”; and sent it by a mounted messenger addressed to “The Guest at\r\nthe Paper Shop”.\r\n\r\nBut in twenty minutes the messenger returned to her with it, Hogarth\r\nhaving gone to the _rendezvous_ at the elm--long before the appointed\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen, accordingly, Frankl, O'Hara, and Harris arrived at the paper-shop\r\nback yard, and Harris had stolen up the back stairs, he presently, to\r\nthe alarm and delight of the others, sent a whisper from the window: “No\r\none 'ere as I can see!”\r\n\r\nAnd the search for the diamonds was short: for Hogarth had actually left\r\nthe bag containing them on the trunk, and Frankl and O'Hara returned\r\nwith it to Westring, holding it out at arm's length, one with the right,\r\none with the left hand, like standard-bearers.\r\n\r\nHogarth, meantime, was striding about the elm, and once fell to his\r\nknees, adoring a vision, and once, at a fancied step, his teeth-edges\r\nchattered.\r\n\r\nRebekah! He called, groaned, hissed that name, while his to-and-fro\r\nranging quickened to a trot.\r\n\r\nAnd now, fancying that he heard a call “_Come !_” he stood startled,\r\nstruck into a twisting enquiry to the four winds; but could not locate\r\nthe call, ran hither and thither, saw no one.\r\n\r\n“Come to me, little sister”, he wailed tenderly, while to swallow was a\r\ndoubtful spasm for him, her name a mountain in his bosom.\r\n\r\nWhen he was certain that it must be nearer ten than “nine”, he set out\r\nin the sway of a turbulent impulse to spurt for the Hall: but as he\r\nreached the point of proximity between path and park, just there where\r\nher father had stood that morning he saw her patiently waiting--ever\r\nsince that “_Come!_”\r\n\r\nHe flew, and was about to skip up the bank, when, with forbidding arm,\r\nshe cried: “Don't you approach me!”--and he stood checked and abject,\r\none foot planted on the bank, looking up, ready to dart for her in her\r\nOriental dress, flimsy, baggy at the girdle, her arms bare, her fingers\r\nclasped before her, making convex the two tassels of the girdle, from\r\nher ears depending circles of gold large enough to hoop with, a saffron\r\nheaddress, stuck backward, showing her hair in front, falling upon a\r\nshawl which sheltered her frank recumbent shoulders. She did not see\r\nHogarth at all, but stood averted, implacable, unapproachable, looking\r\nacross the park, while Hogarth occupied a long silence in gazing up to\r\nwhere, like a show, she stood, illumined by the moon.\r\n\r\nAt last he sent to her the whisper, “Did you call just now? Did you say\r\n'_Come_'?”\r\n\r\n“What is it you want with me, Hogarth? You have '_summoned_' me: but be\r\nvery quick”.\r\n\r\n“I told you: I am wealthier than all the princes--”\r\n\r\n“Well, let me inform you that your life is in danger here; if you are a\r\nwise man, you will not fail to leave this neighbourhood this night”.\r\n\r\n“But no one knows--”\r\n\r\n“It is known, Hogarth: your friends are false, and your enemies crafty.\r\nYou will have to walk with your eyes open, my friend. What will you do\r\nwith all the money?”\r\n\r\n“I will buy the world, because _you_ are in it”.\r\n\r\nNow she flashed upon him one glance, in which there was astonishment,\r\nand judgment.\r\n\r\n“You said that so like my father! Hogarth among the dealers? I thought\r\nyou would be more squeamish, and arduous, and complex”.\r\n\r\n“But if a man is famished, he is not complex, he runs to the baker's.\r\nYou can have no conception how I perish! And I cannot be contradicted-I\r\nclaim you-I have the right-I am the lord of this lower world--”\r\n\r\n“But you do not see the effect of your words: you disappoint me Richard.\r\nHow of what the poet sings:\r\n\r\n  ...this is my favoured lot,\r\n  My exaltation to afflictions high?\r\n\r\nThat is more in your line, you know, but you are dazzled, Hogarth-fie.\r\nTo _buy me_! And how would you like me afterwards, having renounced my\r\nobligations? And how would I like _you_-I whose name is Rebekah, who\r\nwill mate with none but a wrestler, a fellow of heroic muscle? I feel\r\ncertain that you are dazzled. It is natural, I suppose--But are all the\r\npeople in the world so happy, that _you_ too, can find nothing to occupy\r\nyou but the market-place, with its buying and selling? And to buy _me_?\r\nI am _not_ for sale! How dare you, Hogarth?”\r\n\r\nWith this she walked off; but, having a creepy instinct in her back\r\nthat he was on the point to follow, catch, and snatch her away, she span\r\nround again, crying: “Do not follow me! Mind you! If you like, be at\r\nthe elm-tree again at half-past ten-and I will communicate with you.\r\nGoodbye--”\r\n\r\nNow she did not once look back; and he had not heard that fainting\r\n“Good-bye”, it had fainted so.\r\n\r\nHe found himself presently in his room at the paper-shop, and lay biting\r\nthe bed-clothes, spasm after spasm traversing his body.\r\n\r\nThen, turning on his back, he lay with his face now toward the trunk,\r\nand a little clock ticked ten more minutes before the fact stole into\r\nhis consciousness that the bag was not on the trunk.\r\n\r\nFor some time the disappearance was too stupendous to find room in his\r\nbrain. He got up and paced, stunned, just conscious of a feeling of\r\nunease.\r\n\r\nNow he was searching the room mechanically. It was not there....\r\n\r\nAnd again he paced, tapping his top teeth with a finger-nail; and now he\r\ncalled down the stair: “Have you seen, Mrs. Sturgess, the calico bag you\r\ngave me to-day?”\r\n\r\n“Why, no”.\r\n\r\n“Has anyone been in my room?”\r\n\r\n“Why, _no_, sir! Only myself”.\r\n\r\nAgain he began to pace, and suddenly the grand reality stabbed his brain\r\nlike a dagger: he was poor....\r\n\r\nO'Hara! Where was he....?\r\n\r\nHis forehead dropped upon the mantel-board, and he leant staring\r\ndownward there, a miserable man.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the man said quietly aloud, raising himself: “All right:\r\nbetter so. O, I have not been myself--virtue has gone out of me--!”\r\n\r\nPresently he noticed that it was near the hour of her unexpected\r\n_rendezvous_ under the elm....\r\n\r\nAnd nearly all the way he ran--wild to see her again--until he neared\r\nthe tree, when, descrying a female form, he came stooping with humility,\r\nbut soon saw that it was a girl, her head in a shawl, whom he did not\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAnd she, coming to meet him, said: “What is your name, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“I am Miss Frankl's messenger”.\r\n\r\n“My name is Hogarth”.\r\n\r\n“Will you turn this way that I may see your eyes?...All right: Miss\r\nFrankl directs me to give you these”.\r\n\r\nThe girl, who had been weighted down toward the left, handed him an\r\nenvelope, and a steel box.\r\n\r\nNever was he so bewildered! On the way home, he observed that the box\r\nhad three knobs of gold, surrounded by rays, and, inlaid in the top, the\r\nletters “R. F.”; when he tore open the envelope in his room he found in\r\npencil on one half-sheet:\r\n\r\n“Turn the 10 of the right knob to the ray 5; the 5 of the middle knob\r\nto the ray 0; the 15 of the left knob to the ray 10: and the box will\r\nopen”.\r\n\r\nNo more. When he had set wildly to work, and the lid turned back, his\r\neyes beheld the calico bag.\r\n\r\nRebekah had, in fact, before setting out to the _rendezvous_ at nine,\r\nseen her father and O'Hara return to the Hall, bearing the bag between\r\nthem; and, she, crouching at the side door, as before, had heard them\r\ntalk, arranging details. Her father had then said that before he could\r\nwrite any document, he must either ring or go search for paper: and\r\nsuddenly she had heard an oath, a thud, a scuffle, had turned the\r\nkey, softly entered, seen the men struggling against the other door, a\r\nrevolver, held by the muzzle, in O'Hara's hand; and before she had been\r\nsighted by the two desperate men, had had the bag, lying near on an\r\nescritoire, and was gone. She had then sent some servants to the scene,\r\nand hurried to her chamber.\r\n\r\nLater she had heard that O'Hara had escaped through a window, and that\r\nher father was raving below in a sort of fit: for Frankl supposed that\r\nO'Hara had the jewels, as O'Hara that Frankl had them; and after tending\r\nher father, she had dashed out to the _rendezvous_, the jewels then in\r\nher room.\r\n\r\nAs for Hogarth, he did not neglect her warning: and, having left a note\r\nfor O'Hara, telling him where to find him, at Loveday's, took a late\r\ntrain southwards.\r\n\r\nBy what marvel Rebekah had become possessed of the jewels he did not\r\neven seek to fathom; but one of his uppermost feelings was shame for\r\nhaving suspected O'Hara of stealing them: and for years could never be\r\ngot to believe in the bad faith of the prelate, his tutor.\r\n\r\nNear midnight, on reaching the obscure townlet of Hadston, he there took\r\na bed--not to sleep.\r\n\r\nAt the tiny inn-window he made periodic arrivals, looked out unseeing at\r\na cart, a wall of flint and Flemish brick, and a moonlit country, then\r\nweighed anchor, and swerved away on another voyage; then arrived anew,\r\nlooked out, saw nothing, and weighed.\r\n\r\nHe walked now in the dark of the valley of humiliation, with those words\r\nwritten in flame in his brain: “This is my favoured lot--my exaltation\r\nto afflictions high”: he had allowed a woman to say them to him, and he\r\nwent “_I!_”\r\n\r\nHe, the richest of men, was, therefore, that night poorer than any\r\nwretch, brought right down, naked, exposed to death, and he filled that\r\nchamber with his moans: “God have mercy upon me! a vulgar rich man...a\r\ndreadful contented clown....”\r\n\r\nBut toward morning he lay calmer, weeping like Peter, and at peace.\r\n\r\nBeing without money, he sent the next day a small stone to Loveday,\r\nasking him to sell it; also to meet old Tom Bates on the night\r\nappointed, and keep him till he, Hogarth, came to London.\r\n\r\nFour days later he received the money in the name of “Mr. Beech”,\r\nbut the old Bates had not kept the _rendezvous_; and a month later a\r\ndetective agency discovered that the fisher was dead.\r\n\r\nAt Hadston Hogarth remained two months, the most occupied man anywhere,\r\nyet passing for a lounger in the townlet.\r\n\r\nHere and now he was descended deep into himself, aspiring to greatness,\r\nset on high designs; and, as the days passed, his thoughts more and more\r\ntook form, though sometimes, with a sudden heart-pang, he would flinch\r\nand shrink, pierced by a consciousness of the unwieldy thing which he\r\nwas at; and he would mutter: “I _must_ be mad”. Anon he would start and\r\ncower at a distinct sound of cannon in his ears.\r\n\r\nUsually, during the day, he had with him an atlas, a pair of compasses.\r\n\r\nOne day he took train, to see the sea.\r\n\r\nAnother day, happening to look into the goat-hair trunk, he saw that\r\naccount-book, containing the addresses of the signatories to his old\r\n“association”, and was overjoyed. “Quite a little army”, he tenderly\r\nsaid: “I won't forget them”.\r\n\r\nAfter two months he left Hadston for London, having in his head a new\r\nage hatched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was night when Hogarth broke into the presence of Loveday at Cheyne\r\nGardens with a glad face, crying: “Forgive me, my friend, for being a\r\nboor!”\r\n\r\n“You are forgiven”, Loveday answered with his smile, hastening to meet\r\nhim: “the broken picture, you see, is in a better frame, and so are we.\r\nWhat could have made us invent a quarrel about--land, of all things!”\r\n\r\n“Come, let us talk”, said Hogarth: “not long--all about land, and sea,\r\ntoo. I suppose you have nothing to tell about my sister? Never mind--we\r\nshall find her. Come, sit and give me _all_ your intelligence. You\r\nare not interested in land, then? You _will_ be in ten minutes--it is\r\ninteresting. Listen: all the land of the earth is _mine_, and all\r\nthe sea especially--a good thing, for, for a hundred years Europe,\r\nespecially England, has wanted a master: the anarchy of our modern life\r\nis too terrible! it cannot arrange itself; and now the hour has struck,\r\nthough none has heard the bell”.\r\n\r\n“Hogarth! but you gabble like a mad god”, cried Loveday. “I am all in\r\nthe dark--”\r\n\r\n“I will tell you”.\r\n\r\nAnd he spoke, first going into his discovery at Colmoor, frowning upon\r\nLoveday, ploughing the truth into his brow; proving how modern misery,\r\nin its complexity, had its cause in one simple old fault, sure as the\r\nfact that smoke ascends, or apples fall. And when he saw conviction beam\r\nin Loveday's face, he next told what had happened at the elm-tree, and\r\nwhat would happen-soon; whereat Loveday, like a frightened child, clung\r\nto his arm, and once gasped: “Oh no--my God!” and once felt a gory ghost\r\nraise horror in his hairs.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterwards they were bending over a sheet of paper, Hogarth in\r\nhis shirt-sleeves, writing, Loveday overlooking, suggesting, when\r\ntwo men were announced, and in stepped O'Hara with bows and polished\r\nhesitations, followed by his shadow, Harris; and, “Ah, O'Hara...” cried\r\nHogarth, still writing, “who is that with you?”\r\n\r\n“A friend of mine”, said Loveday, for O'Hara had introduced Harris to\r\nhim, and he had adopted Harris as a human study, horrid, but amusing.\r\n\r\nThe moment O'Hara saw the face of Hogarth, he started, muttering: “He\r\nhas the diamonds back! God! is he a magician?”\r\n\r\nAnd Harris drawled nasally: “Of course, you wouldn't know me now, Mr.\r\n76! Were there not ten cleansed, but where are the nine, it _is_”.\r\n\r\nHogarth was silent--had not yet decided what to do with Harris.\r\n\r\n“This is my tenth call here, Hogarth”, said O'Hara, “in the hope of\r\nseeing you, and the streets, you know, are no small risk. You see how\r\nI am muffled up, and this gentleman, too. By the bye, I have selected a\r\ncargo of books for you--”\r\n\r\n“No study for a month”, said Hogarth, “but I shall want you all the\r\nsame. Just come over here and watch me write this thing. You, Harris,\r\nsit right over there”.\r\n\r\nHarris cursed, but obeyed, while O'Hara came and bent under the golden\r\nglow of the silk shade a brow puckered with a care of puzzlement, as he\r\nread.\r\n\r\nThen he fell into the work, and was soon the director of it--invaluable!\r\nknew everything! remembered forgotten points; explained technicalities;\r\nthe proper person in each little State to whom the document must be\r\ndirected, the style of addressing him. Of one sentence he said: “That\r\nwill never do--lacks formality”; and of another: “Tut, they will laugh\r\nat that--it is provincial and insolent”, distracted between the work and\r\nhis brandy glass. At last, about eleven, the three brains had produced a\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nHogarth laid claim to the sea as his private property, and warned the\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\n\r\nPRIORITY OF CLAIM\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentleman--a Permanent Under-secretary--stood one noon, his back to a\r\nfireplace in a bright-carpeted room at the Foreign Office, letting his\r\neyes move over some opened letters submitted to him, and presently came\r\nupon the following document, its crest a flag, containing in blue the\r\nletters “R. F.”:\r\n\r\n“17 LEADENHALL STR., E.G.\r\n\r\n“To the Most Hon.,\r\n\r\n“The Marquis of Hallam, K.G.,\r\n\r\n“Foreign Office,\r\n\r\n“Westminster, S.W.\r\n\r\n“MY LORD MARQUIS:\r\n\r\n“I have the honour hereby to make formal announcement to Your Lordship\r\nthat I am on the point of setting up in the midst of the world a new\r\nPower, whose relations with the King's Government will, I trust, be\r\nrelations of friendliness.\r\n\r\n“It is my desire that Your Lordship forthwith convey to the King's\r\nMost Excellent Majesty the announcement which is the subject of this\r\nMemorandum.\r\n\r\n“My purposes and policy in the establishment of the new Power will\r\nhereafter appear; and my properly accredited Ministers will, in due\r\ncourse, present themselves at the Chancelleries of the world.\r\n\r\n“Hitherto a British subject, it is my will to acquire diplomatic\r\nrecognition--as soon as such shall comport with the dignity of the Great\r\nPowers--as an Independent Sovereign, under the title of: 'Lord of the\r\nSea'.

Servant,\r\n\r\n“RICHARD HOGARTH “.\r\n\r\nThe Under-secretary, a pale, distinguished man, read this letter with a\r\nlittle lift of one eyebrow, then let it drop from him into a waste-paper\r\nbasket.\r\n\r\nAt the German, the Turkish, capitals it met much the same reception.\r\nNowhere did it reach the eye of a Departmental Head. It went to Siam, to\r\nthe Prince of Monaco, to Ecuador, and was tossed to cumber a basket, or\r\nmoulder on a file.\r\n\r\nBut Hogarth, who knew that it would be instantly forgotten, had written\r\nit so as to be able to say that he had written it.\r\n\r\nAt that time he was lodging in a top room in Bloomsbury, and had an\r\nunderground den in Leadenhall Street, on its doors the words: “R. Beech\r\n& Co.” Thither in a brougham he drove daily, lying very low, but holding\r\nin that den interviews with all sorts and conditions of men, and feeling\r\nhis way toward operations of dimensions so immense, that their mere\r\nproject had a modifying influence upon industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nMR. BEECH\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring six weeks Hogarth lived that life of daily passage between Keppel\r\nStreet and his office, unknown to the general world, but spreading a\r\nnoise of rumour through certain circles of the business world. All day\r\nin the den the gas-jets brawled upon him, he not for minutes casting\r\na glance, if a clerk brought a caller's name. And here was no novice\r\nmodesty in the tackling of affairs; as O'Hara, who would be there, said:\r\n“You must have been _born_ in the City; you have the airs, the very\r\ntricks, of Threadneedle Street, you--Jew”. In a day the prelate counted\r\nseven hundred and thirteen telegrams from the Terni Cannon foundry, many\r\na diamond dealer, polisher, cutter, the Vulcan Shipyard of Stettin,\r\nthe Clydebank, Cramp of Philadelphia, the Russian Finance Minister, San\r\nFrancisco, Lloyd's, metal brokers, the Neva, and one night, the eve of\r\na dash to Amsterdam, he, with O'Hara, Loveday, and five clerks, sat\r\nswotting till morning broke, sustained by gin and soda-water. The priest\r\nlived with wide eyes at the easy fleetness with which Hogarth rolled\r\noff him the greatest affairs: as when on the day after his return from\r\nHolland he stood, his thumbs in his waistcoat armholes, with quite the\r\nright air of serene City-king, his tallness possessing considerable\r\nnatural courtliness, and the De Beers' Secretary sat before him, saying,\r\n“Well, Mr. Beech, I have spent the morning with your brokers, and have\r\nfelt that I must see you personally before calling a meeting. This\r\nproposition is so tremendous--”\r\n\r\n“I only wish I had some time”, said Hogarth, “I would invite you to dine\r\nupon the matter; but it is really so simple--everything at bottom\r\nis merely twice two are four. And you are not obliged to turn over\r\nKimberley to me: only, in that case, as I have said, I shall be\r\ncompelled to flood the market with diamonds as cheap as cat's-eyes--”\r\n\r\nWhen De Beers stared, Hogarth shrugged, saying: “I suppose I must\r\nconvince you--” and, unlocking a safe, he took out an _écrin_ which\r\ncontained three stones. De Beers appeared to see Titania peering in\r\ntheir fairy painting.\r\n\r\n“Of stones of this water and carating”, said Hogarth, “we have two\r\nhundred and eleven in the Bank of England, two hundred and thirty-eight\r\nin other English and Continental banks, and seventy-five in\r\nsafe-deposit. The carating of these three is 111-1/2; and in the\r\nsixties, such as this one”--he took a stone from among coppers in his\r\npocket--“we have three hundred odd on hand, all flawless, and an equal\r\nnumber cutting. When I point out, what you know, that our mine is as yet\r\nwithout the delicate plant of Kimberley, the stones being simply picked\r\nfrom the blue-earth by three inexpert friends of the firm on the spot,\r\nyou will recognize that the wealth of a mine can no further go....”\r\n\r\nHe was rid of the visitor within six minutes, and within three weeks,\r\nby knack and organization, had gathered into his hands most of the reins\r\nnecessary to the control of the world's trade in diamonds.\r\n\r\nIn an outer room sat O'Hara, writing, reading Theocritus, or a little\r\nbook on mediaeval embroidery, forefinger on cheek; and anon, absolutely\r\nwithout motive, he would rise, creep, and peep through a keyhole at\r\nHogarth, then on stalking, bowing tiptoe, grinning a rancid grimace of\r\nstealth, get back to his seat, and read--the tutor falling over head and\r\nears in love with his pupil: one of those passions that end tragically.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he so sat, the bell _pinged_, the door opened, and O'Hara\r\njumped to find himself face to face with--Frankl, who had come to see\r\nthe new diamond king, in the firm belief that Mr. Beech was none other\r\nthan O'Hara; and, “I thought as much!” said he.\r\n\r\n“_Sh-h-h_”, went O'Hara bitterly--“for God's sake! he is _in there_--!”\r\n\r\n“Who is?”\r\n\r\n“_Hogarth!_”\r\n\r\n“Well, but--”\r\n\r\n“Outside--in the passage--”\r\n\r\nThey stepped out; and Frankl, his eyelids red, said: “I have only this\r\nday crawled from bed with the blow you struck my temple, or I should\r\nhave had you before this--”\r\n\r\n“_Sh-h-h_. Your own fault, sir. _You_ played false first--”\r\n\r\n“Played false with my own diamonds? You hand me over this day one-half\r\nthose stones, or I bring a civil action for the whole, hound you to\r\nbeggary, and drag you back to your convict-cell where you come from”.\r\n\r\n“Don't lift your voice, I beg of you. Tut, you rave. You can't bring a\r\ncivil action against a great millionaire who doesn't care to defend;\r\nand as for me, I do assure you, I haven't fifty pounds to-day. _It is\r\nHogarth who is Mr. Beech!_”\r\n\r\n“_Who?_”--Frankl obtruded a startled ear, frowning his eyes small.\r\n\r\n“Hogarth. He has the diamonds back!”\r\n\r\n“Which diamonds? How did he get 'em?”\r\n\r\n“He is--_in_--_there_: better go and ask him! He got them by black\r\nart--by the aid of the legion of mediaeval witches which wait on\r\nhim--_God_ knows how he got them! _You_ gave them to him! _I_ gave them\r\nto him! but he's got them--_in--there_! Better go and ask him--don't be\r\nafraid--just for the roaring fun of it--”\r\n\r\n“Hogarth?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--Hogarth, Hogarth”.\r\n\r\n“Cheated the gallows? And out of prison? And rolling in my wealth, my\r\nriches, my diamonds? Oh, no!--is that fair? A dog? Is that how the world\r\nis run? God of Israel!”\r\n\r\n“There is this to be said for him: that he _deserves_ to be rich--”\r\n\r\n“Who? So you are taking his part now?”\r\n\r\n“Tut--!”\r\n\r\n“There is no _tut_ about it! You confess that you are nothing more than\r\na penniless hanger-on: well, then, I have _you_! back to prison you go\r\nthis hour---!”\r\n\r\nO'Hara's cheek trembled; but he said: “A sufficiently vain threat, sir:\r\nI am Hogarth's tutor: he won't let me be taken. Don't waste your time,\r\nyou impotent Jew--”\r\n\r\n“Tutor? That's good! What you teaching him?--murder? _outrage?_ He\r\n_ought_ to have a tutor, he! That's good! Tutor! Well, suppose I drop\r\na line first post to your nice _pupil_ to let him know that it was his\r\n_tutor_ who stole his diamonds--”\r\n\r\nAt this threat O'Hara felt himself outflanked; and though his eyes\r\nsurveyed the Jew unflinchingly during a silence, inwardly he had\r\nsuccumbed.\r\n\r\n“A man in Hogarth's situation”, he slowly said, “is always liable\r\nto attack. Why should two sharp old fellows like you and me, whose\r\ninterests are identical, quarrel?”--and instantly Frankl took note of\r\nthat surrender, that weak spot, and knew that the man was his.\r\n\r\n“Well”, said he, “so true--two old gaol-birds like you and me, eh? So\r\ntrue, so true. But what beats me--who runs Beech's? Hogarth is only a\r\nyoung farmer: he can't operate all the big things I hear about this Mr.\r\nBeech--”\r\n\r\n“Tut, you do not conceive the man as he is at all”, said O'Hara:\r\n“perhaps you cannot. High finance, the first day he looked into it,\r\nceased to mystify him, for he goes always to the ground of things,\r\ntouches bottom, where first principles lie, and first principles\r\nare simple as two and two. It was because he had discovered a first\r\nprinciple that he escaped from Colmoor. And he is as nimble as six\r\ntwisting minnows: what you or I learned in a year he learns in an hour,\r\nand if he does not know the usual way, not an instant does he hesitate\r\nto invent a way. You know about Owthwaite's: how the recent shake-out of\r\nthe market threatened their collapse, like so many others'. Owthwaite's,\r\nin fact, had already declared, when Hogarth decided to help them over.\r\nAnd how? Not Bills! He filled up a call-in of two millions and a half\r\nby the India Council, resettled loans and short-discount business,\r\ncheapened money, and in twelve hours his _protégés_ were off the rocks.\r\nAnd now I hear--”\r\n\r\n“But why not buy a chapel, and preach about him? I hate--”\r\n\r\n“Stop! O Lord--he is calling--”\r\n\r\n“Here's my card; I want to see you to-night at that address at eight”.\r\n\r\nAnd that night at Frankl's town-house in Hanover Square Jew and prelate\r\nconferred, O'Hara for some time resisting, but finally again taking\r\nsides against his saviour. He disclosed that Hogarth, beyond doubt,\r\nkept a few diamonds in a goat-hair trunk in his room--enough to make\r\ntwo ordinary fortunes, and also carried two or three, with some\r\nhundred-pound notes on his person; and this was made the basis of a\r\nscheme for bringing about the arrest of Hogarth, the first step being\r\nto get from Hogarth the sum he carried about him, leaving him in a\r\nsituation where he would find himself powerless to bribe.\r\n\r\nThis Frankl undertook; and O'Hara promised to lend Harris, and some\r\nfriends of Harris.\r\n\r\nNow, during these weeks Hogarth was living in some fear, haunted by\r\ninsecurity and a vision of Colmoor; and, remembering the theft at\r\nThring, with a consciousness of Frankl somewhere in him, he went not\r\nonly with diamonds on his person, but a revolver as well, and a _puñal_\r\nof Toledo.\r\n\r\nBut three evenings after the conference in Hanover Square, he received\r\nthis letter:\r\n\r\n“Dearest Richard:\r\n\r\n“It is long since we have met. This is to let you know that I have heard\r\nof your getting out, and your coming into great things, which has made\r\nmy heart rejoice. I, alas, am just the other way about. I am staying for\r\nthe next two days at Woodfield Cottage, Wylie Street, Finchley Road,\r\nN. I understand that you are lying low, so better not come to see me\r\nperhaps, but send me something.\r\n\r\n“Your loving\r\n\r\n“Margaret”.\r\n\r\nAnd at sight of these words such a whirlwind transacted itself in the\r\nbrain of Hogarth, that he hardly awoke to sense till he found himself in\r\na railway compartment, going northward. It was only then that, reading\r\nthe letter again, he started.\r\n\r\nThe handwriting was hers! he was sure. But the words...?\r\n\r\n“I, alas, am _just the other way about_”--“better not come to me\r\nperhaps, but _send me something_”. There was a tone here not in\r\ncharacter. But her handwriting! This was no forgery. If she had written\r\n_from dictation_ that might explain it.\r\n\r\nIn this uncertainty he left the train, and took cab, scenting trouble\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was to find Wylie Street, which was a half-built street\r\nof five cottages in a new neighbourhood of brick, and when what was\r\nsupposed to be Wylie Street was discovered, the cab had to stop, for\r\nacross it lay bricks, hods and barrows in mud. So Hogarth alighted, and,\r\npeering, stumbled forward: no lamp; above, a labouring half-moon riding\r\na sky of clouds, like a poor ship riding the bleak morning after a\r\nhurricane, her masts all gone by the board: and Hogarth could just\r\nsee that three of the five cottages were roofless brick, the fourth\r\nunfinished, so the fifth, alone on the other side, must be--“Woodfield.”\r\n\r\n“Woodfield” was unlighted: and the moment he ascertained this, he felt\r\nhimself the victim of a plot; but not all the whispers of prudence could\r\nhold him now from seeing the adventure through. Loudly he flung back\r\nthe little gate, with rash precipitancy entered: and as he sprang up the\r\nthree steps to ring, he was seized.\r\n\r\nThey were five, three being big fellows, two masked.\r\n\r\nHis main sensation was gladness that none, apparently, was a policeman;\r\nand he set hilariously to work with his knuckles. This, however, could\r\nnot save, soon he was on his back, striking his head; but when he saw\r\nthat the object was to rifle his pockets, letting be, he managed to\r\nsteal out the _puñal_ from his breast, and presently with a sudden\r\nupheaving and scattering rage, was staggering to his legs. Before he\r\ncould be stopped, he was making for the gate, but close upon him ran one\r\nof the five--a slim man, masked--who fired Hogarth's own pistol at his\r\nlegs, but missed: whereupon, Hogarth, with a backward twist, struck at\r\nrandom with the dagger, which entered the man's breast. But at the same\r\ntime a whistle shrilled, and from an opposite cottage rushed out at last\r\nwhat he dreaded--three policemen.\r\n\r\nThese had been placed there on the understanding that it was thither\r\nthat Hogarth would go, the object of the plot being to rifle his pockets\r\nbefore he was officially taken; and it succeeded to the extent that his\r\npockets _were_ rifled: but he knocked down one officer, and dodged the\r\nother two, reaching his taxi; and, having previously arranged with the\r\ncabman, got off racing.\r\n\r\nBut the masked man whom he had struck down was Harris, who for weeks lay\r\nraving in fever--an ill-fated stroke, for Harris had a memory.\r\n\r\nAs for Hogarth, he rushed home to Keppel Street, hurried down the trunk,\r\nand was off to Cheyne Gardens.\r\n\r\n“Well”, he cried, breaking in upon Loveday, “this phase of our life is\r\nup! Look at my clothes: I have had a fight--Frankl, I suppose. I wanted\r\nto live a simple life for two years: but they won't let me, you see.\r\nHa!--then the other thing. From this night we bury our identity under\r\nmountains of splendour. It is disgusting to me, this life, skulking,\r\nthinking to bribe honest men. Meantime, you must find me some room to\r\nhide in with the trunk--mustn't stay here to-night. And to-morrow you\r\nbuy me a boat to take us off from some point of the coast--Come--”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\n\r\nTHE HAMMERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin six months Hogarth, as distinct from “Beech”, had risen upon\r\nthe consciousness of Europe, say like the morning sun: and the wearied\r\nworker, borne at evening through crowded undergrounds, might read his\r\nname with a listless incomprehension.\r\n\r\nHe impressed the popular fancy, especially in Paris, where he was\r\nbest known, as erratic: as once when, by a stroke of financial\r\nsleight-of-hand, he got the young Government of Russia into a tight\r\nplace, then refused them a loan, except on condition of the lease to\r\nhim of the Kremlin: and for three months squalid old Moscow was the most\r\ncometary Court anywhere--acts savouring of a meteorite waywardness which\r\nimpressed him, more than anything, upon the everyday world; and he won a\r\ntolerant wonder.\r\n\r\nHowever, an outcry, led by the _Intransigeant_, denounced his\r\nacquisition of the site of royal St. Cloud for his Paris residence on\r\nthe ground that he was a Jew, betrayed by his face--an accusation which\r\ncaused the buying up of hundreds of thousands of his photographs--and on\r\nthe ground that his design was to familiarize the people with the idea\r\nof his sovereignty, and by a _coup_ to seize the Government; at which\r\nParis was in a ferment, and a midnight mob traversed the _Bois_ and\r\ndemolished some of his mason-work. The next day, however, the Minister\r\nof the Interior announced from the Tribune that Hogarth was no Jew, but\r\nan Englishman _pur sang_; and, on the whole, Hogarth had his way: the\r\nnoise died down; and where parterres and avenues had stood on the old\r\npalace site, there arose one of those enchanting fabrics, which, from\r\nthe Bosphorus to London, bore the name of “The Beeches”.\r\n\r\nAt this time he had dependent upon him a retinue, serving him in\r\nmultifarious ways from electrical adviser to spy, and from chancellor\r\nto recruiter, numbering many hundreds. He knew five thousand faces by\r\nsight; in England had two armies--a small one collecting data as to\r\nacreages, tenures, trades, scales, wages, prices, crimes, mines, and a\r\nlarge one, numbering five thousand, doing gun-practice in Westring Vale:\r\nfor, England being for sale, he had bought at thrice its market value\r\nthat part of it called Westring; and on the sea also he kept a little\r\narmy of a thousand, borne in old cruiser-hulks bought from the English\r\nAdmiralty, hulks whose crews, in rotation, changed places with drafts\r\nfrom the Westring barracks.\r\n\r\nOnce he disappeared from Europe, and when he returned the President of\r\nthe Republic of Ecuador, thenceforth one of his closest friends, was\r\nwith him; whereupon, through newspapers in the pay of Beech's, the\r\nrumour commenced to appear that the Ecuador Government was giving\r\norders for coast-defence on an unparalleled scale, in view of probable\r\nhostilities with Peru.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of which activities O'Hara said to him one morning: “You\r\ncan now be called a mathematician”.\r\n\r\n“I have many admirers, and but one teacher, O'Hara”, Hogarth answered:\r\n“teach me”.\r\n\r\nO'Hara cut a secret grimace.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the Finchley Road plot he had had another\r\nrepentance, and had set himself earnestly to the cultivation of\r\nHogarth's mind; but the priest's spirit was not “erect”; he had “falls”;\r\nmaintained a correspondence with the Jew, whose eye of malice never\r\nslept; and once at Cairo, twice in Paris, Hogarth had to use words\r\nlike these: “I must tell you, O'Hara, that I have heard of your recent\r\nbehaviour. Naturally, there are those that see for me, and I do not mean\r\nto be compromised by your low revels”.\r\n\r\n“Wretch that I am!” broke out O'Hara with smitten brow, and for half\r\na day was on his knees in an affliction of self-reproach. Yet the same\r\nnight he wrote a letter to Frankl containing the words: “You do not\r\nknow, _you cannot dream_, the high and slippery road which H. has chosen\r\nfor his feet: the future is _big_ with events. Wait: his sublime path is\r\nnot without pitfalls....”\r\n\r\nStudy with O'Hara was in the morning; at night, when possible, that\r\nother study of the working world: and often then Hogarth would withdraw\r\nfrom opera in the St. Cloud palace, or from some “crush”, to give an\r\nhour to the river of statistics with which he was inundated.\r\n\r\nTill these years he had never seen into the sea of things as it is: his\r\nlife so isolated--had not even read newspapers.\r\n\r\nNow he saw and knew. There below him blazed some masque of beauty and\r\nmajesty, moving under a moonlight of blue-darting jets of electric light\r\nall among colossal columns of alabaster robed in vine and rose; or\r\nthere below some Melba voice, all trembles and maze of wobbly trebles,\r\nwarbling: and the thronged hall sat tranced; but before _him_--figures:\r\nparents killed their children for insurance-money--keeping children\r\nin cellars till their flesh grew green, keeping sore the stumps of\r\nchildren's legs; with some trades certain comic-sounding names had got\r\nto be associated, “potter's rot”, “phossy jaw”,--enormous horror;\r\neach day in England one million people had to seek pauper-relief, many\r\nperished; of aged persons 40 per cent were permanent paupers; children\r\nwere paid 2-1/2d. for making 144 match-boxes; pretty girls (though\r\npretty girls were detestably rare) were allowed to work, nay _forced_\r\nto--far harder than any ten savages ever dreamt of working; in Glasgow\r\n41 of every 100 families lived in one room: fathers, for weeks, did\r\nnot see their children, except asleep; girls took emetics to vomit up\r\ncotton-dust--enormous horror, comic-opera in Hell: and below in the\r\n“crush” the voice of the warbler, cooing, shook.\r\n\r\nSometimes he would mutter: “But that can't be true!” There, though, the\r\nfigures lay; and presently he would take heart, and say: “Well, not for\r\nlong now, God help me....”\r\n\r\nWhether God helped him or not, certainly Man was helping him: ten\r\nthousand and ten thousand hammers--from Spezzia to Belfast--in\r\nmodel-office and mould-loft and rolling-mill--in foundry and yard and\r\nroaring forge--were ringing upon metal for him, their clamorous industry\r\nclattering over Europe and America carillons of his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\n\r\nWONDER\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost suddenly that noise of chiming hammers reached the general ear.\r\n\r\nFirst in the German Admiralty was wonder when a spy, engaged as a\r\nworkman at Birkenhead, sent to his Government information that the\r\nBritish Government was up to something: something of a novelty so\r\nextraordinary, that as yet he could form no conception as to its object.\r\nThat it was intended for the sea one must suppose: yet it was\r\nevident that nothing of such odd draughtsmanship--of such mastodon\r\nproportions--had ever yet taken the water.\r\n\r\nHe had been clever: had penetrated even the model-office, peered\r\nat detailed draughtsman's-plans, developed from the original\r\nspecifications, as well as at orders for Krupp plates, frames, etc.; had\r\nlistened in the yard to the talk of four naval men acting as a Board\r\nof Inspection; was able to give details of the machining of enormous\r\nprocessed plates to sizes determined by templates, the length of\r\npan-headed rivets, the specific gravity of an average cubic foot, the\r\nscarfing of edges, the accumulation of prepared material. The wooden\r\nhalf-model, he said, was a one-ninety-sixth, instead of the usual\r\none-forty-eighth; yet, even so, it was 5 ft. 7-1/2 ins. long, as much\r\nbroad, and 1 ft. 3/4 in. high. This meant that the structure would\r\nmeasure 180 yards square--over one-tenth of a mile--with a depth of 34\r\nyards. Already the far-reaching chaos of scaffolding had run up\r\neight yards, with stringers and frames to a like level. There were no\r\nkeel-blocks, for there was no keel--or rather, the keel was a circular\r\nplate a yard in diameter, resting on a single block, the shape of\r\nthe structure to be a perfect square, along the sides of which four\r\nbattleships might lie like toy-boats: the bottom, from circular keel\r\nto upward bend, having the same shape as a battleship's seen in midship\r\nsection, only with four faces instead of two. From the knee-bend the\r\nsides ran up perpendicular; but at the level evidently intended to be\r\nthe water-line they struck inward, so that the flat roof was smaller\r\nthan the area below; the position of this water-line giving a definite\r\nclue to the intended displacement; and this again showing that the\r\nwhole--roof, sides, bottom, and all--would be one wall of Simmons\r\narmour--steeling and backing--layer on layer--no less than 4ft. 9-1/4\r\nins. thick.\r\n\r\nYet this stupendous ark, or citadel--so simple was its plan--would be\r\nturned out in less time than a second-class cruiser; and its cost, apart\r\nfrom yard-modifications and groundways, small in proportion.\r\n\r\nThis, and much else, the spy reported: but the new fact was obvious as\r\nthe sun; the British and French Intelligence Departments, too, were soon\r\nconning it; and a week later it was established that, not one, but at\r\nleast eleven, such structures were a-building in the world.\r\n\r\nThere went the rumour: “It is the Government of Ecuador's order....”\r\n\r\nThis was at the end of April; Hogarth, obeying some instinct which\r\ncontinually drew him toward Asia, then loitering alone in Trebizond\r\ntea-gardens and bazaars, buying a braid-bag, mule-trapping, or silver\r\nsword of the Khurdish cavaliers; while Trinity House gave the alarm that\r\nif ever the steel monsters, whatever their object, were launched, “they\r\nwould constitute, in the absence of proper precautions, a serious danger\r\nby night to the world's mercantile marine “, and while Lloyd's, the\r\nMaritime Exchanges, the Hydrographic Offices, lived in a species\r\nof amazement, and were already putting the steel islands into the\r\ngazetteers and manuals; the newspapers, too, inundated with the views of\r\nthe public, took sides, maintaining, some of them, that it was the part\r\nof Governments to ascertain the objects of the new works, others that\r\nany tampering with their progress at this late stage might even mean\r\nrevolution, so profound was their intimacy with industry. Hogarth,\r\nmeanwhile, having come to El Khiff, the camp of the Bedouin pilgrims,\r\nthere spent some days, and then, passing between Jerusalem and Jericho\r\nin a caravan of Moabite sheiks, went visiting the holy places of Israel,\r\neverywhere examining the country, especially its agriculture, with great\r\nminuteness. It was only on his return to Jerusalem that he heard of the\r\nagitation in Europe: and at once set off Westward from Joppa.\r\n\r\nFrom his arrival at Paris toward the end of May the wildest legends,\r\noriginated by him, began to be printed, the most persistent relating\r\nto the diamond and banking House of Beech, which, it was given out, had\r\ndiscovered diamonds within the crust of a Pacific rock-island: the new\r\nstructures, ordered by them, being designed to blast the coast-wall with\r\ndynamite guns. Cavillers pointed out that diamonds never occur in nature\r\nin this fashion, and that, even so, it did not need a fort made of\r\narmour five feet thick to fire off dynamite guns; but so continuously\r\nwas the thing repeated, explained, and puffed, that when the London\r\nmanager of Beech partially admitted it, the most incredulous acquiesced;\r\nthough at the very same period it was proclaimed that the President of\r\nthe Ecuador Republic, Hogarth's friend, had admitted to the Great Powers\r\nthat the forts were to his order (as, in fact, they nominally were);\r\nand anti-climax was reached when a naval expert, asked to do a hurried\r\narticle for the Times, made some error in calculation, and came out with\r\nthe statement that the fort-things would sink of their own weight.\r\nThis article was headed “Beech's Folly”; and even when the error was\r\ndetected, the roar of merriment retained its momentum and rolled: so\r\nthat, to the hour of the first launch, the enterprise was commonly\r\nreferred to as “Beech's Folly”, and scarf-pins, ink-stands, etc., in the\r\nshape of the forts, were sold with that superscription: “Beech's Folly”.\r\n\r\nThis, translated into French, became that horrible gallicism: _la bêtise\r\nBiche_.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, the Ecuador-Beech rage died down the hammers, heard\r\nfor nine days through the turmoil of the world, were again drowned in\r\nit. The scarf-pins ceased to sell. The 'buses rolled, the Bank cashed\r\nnotes, the long street roared--and all was as usual.\r\n\r\nOnly, in the valley of Westring there was drill and target-practice and\r\nbarrack-life routine, the Westring-eccentricity being associated with\r\nthe millionaire, Hogarth, the island-eccentricity with the House of\r\nBeech: and in the popular mind Beech and Hogarth were two notions.\r\nIslands were building in Italy, France, Germany, Russia; in England,\r\nScotland, Ireland; at Maine, Baltimore, Newport News: but the\r\nGovernments, lacking the machinery, and also the initiative, and judging\r\nto-morrow by yesterday, gave no sign from their Olympus.\r\n\r\nIn June, John Loveday being then at Westring, one morning O'Hara\r\narrived, he, too, having left mediæval chasubles to grind at war, and\r\nthough he no longer taught Hogarth, a relation persisted between them;\r\nand always not far from O'Hara was to be found Harris, living now on the\r\npinnacle of dandy bliss, twisting a dandy stick.\r\n\r\nIt was on the last night of this visit to Westring that O'Hara at a late\r\nhour went with stealth and hesitations along a corridor of the Hall, and\r\nfinally tapped at Loveday's door, who, detesting the priest, and reading\r\nin bed, disgustedly dashed off his cigarette ash, as he called: “Come\r\nin”.\r\n\r\nAnd a long time they spoke of things other than the real object of\r\nO'Hara's visit, till O'Hara said: “But--may I ask you something?”\r\n\r\n“Do”.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, you are a fellow more in the counsels of Hogarth than\r\nanother. I want to ask you right out frankly--is it a fact that Hogarth\r\nis choosing Admirals for the islands?”\r\n\r\n“I believe it is”, answered Loveday with his long-bow smile of\r\namusement: “I already know, for example, that Saltoun will admiral\r\nthe _Homer_ in the Indian Ocean, Vladimir the _Ruskin_ in the Atlantic\r\nCrescent, and the young Marquis of Erroll the _Justice_ in the Yellow\r\nSea”.\r\n\r\n“Those all?”\r\n\r\n“All I know of. I believe, however, that Hogarth is in the throes of\r\ndecision as to the rest”.\r\n\r\n“I see”.\r\n\r\nThere was a silence full of Loveday's smile.\r\n\r\n“But”, said O'Hara, “what I meant is this: you know what I have been to\r\nHogarth; without me, what could the poor fellow have done, after all?\r\nI have taught him to think, to dance, and to dine. Now, then, I ask you\r\nright out frankly--am _I_, my son, in the list of Admirals?”\r\n\r\nLoveday, flushing, started upright, and sank back. “No, I don't fancy\r\nthat your name is among those entertained, O'Hara”.\r\n\r\n“We will see about that. Woe to Hogarth, and to his advisers, if he dare\r\nslight O'Hara, my son! What! after preparing myself with toilsome zeal\r\nfor this post? and after two promises from Hogarth's own lips--?”\r\n\r\n“I deny the promises on Hogarth's behalf”.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you! Hogarth looks upon you as a plaything. I do assure you, you\r\nare not taken seriously, Mr. Loveday. How should such as you know what\r\nHogarth promises or designs? “--his cheeks trembling.\r\n\r\nAnd, Loveday, smiling again, though pale: “Well, if we admit the\r\npromises...but--have you accurately acquainted Hogarth with your past,\r\nsir?”\r\n\r\n“Most decidedly, sir!”\r\n\r\n“If you have not, I think he should know it”.\r\n\r\n“Your threats do not affect me, sir! In three days I shall be in\r\nPetersburg with Hogarth, and shall take a pleasure in writing you the\r\nname of the island to which I am appointed”.\r\n\r\n“In three days I also--!” He stopped: but O'Hara understood.\r\n\r\nNow the door rushed open, and in looked Harris in under-vest and\r\ndrawers, beneath his arm a bundle of walkingsticks, which he had been\r\ncaring and telling.\r\n\r\nAnd “'Ere”, he drawled, “when are you coming to 'ave that bit of cold\r\nmutton? It's past twelve o'clock as it is”.\r\n\r\n“I am coming, boy”, said O'Hara, rising with brisk obedience.\r\n\r\n“Then, come, why don't you! There were shepherds watching their pretty\r\nlittle flocks by night, but to leave a man watching the cold animal is a\r\nbit out. Come along!”--and O'Hara went.\r\n\r\nHe reached Petersburg twelve hours before Loveday, his reason for\r\nchoosing that time being his knowledge that Frankl was in Petersburg,\r\nand with him Rebekah, Frankl being in a deal with the new-régime\r\nMinister of Finance.\r\n\r\nFor, as O'Hara had been asking himself the agonized question: “By what\r\nabsolute _finesse_ can I, _just now_, win Hogarth?” the mere presence of\r\nRebekah in the same city with Hogarth drew him thither.\r\n\r\nBut the next day, when Loveday came, nothing had been done--no chance\r\nof _tête-a-tête_ with Hogarth: and that day was O'Hara an anxious\r\nand tremulous man, living on the tip-toe and _qui vive_ of lynx-eyed\r\nkeenness.\r\n\r\nThe same night at a masque at the Palace of Peterhof Loveday got a\r\nchance of dialogue with Hogarth, they seated amid greenery and coloured\r\ngleams, Hogarth groomed to the glittering glass of his shoes, his legs\r\nstretched, arm akimbo; and presently Loveday led the talk to things\r\nof the sea. “What an extraordinary activity! The British Government\r\nlaunches the _Peleus_ next Monday at Deptford--the first 28,000-ton\r\nwar-boat; and seven cruisers on the slips. Then the French,\r\nAustro-German, Russian--”\r\n\r\n“Ha!--I know. They won't build long”.\r\n\r\n“Still the confidence?”\r\n\r\n“You can only ask, my dear boy, because you do not yet see what a thing\r\nthe battleship really is--much more than half a sham. The march of\r\ninvention is from the complex to the simple: for simplicity is strength;\r\nbut to the moment when I began to construct, naval construction had not\r\nfollowed this law: for from the old smooth-bores, aimed with tackle and\r\nquoin, to the present regime of electric wires, you have had a\r\ncontinual advance in complexity--always within the same little arc of\r\nthought--till now the most complex of things is a battleship; and if\r\nyou ask me which is the weaker, a battleship or a watch, I answer a\r\nbattleship--_weak_ meaning liability to the injuries which they were\r\nbuilt to resist. In such a case as that of the _Maine_, sunk at Havana,\r\none might fancy that the task of naval constructors is to turn out\r\na thing to sink with a minimum of trouble; and you remember the\r\n_Camperdown_ and _Victoria_, how, playing about together, one happened\r\nto touch the other, when down plunged that other. These ships are\r\na compromise between three _motifs_--speed, resisting attack, and\r\nattacking: and the first is so antagonistic to the second, and also\r\nto the third, that the net result is almost a Nonentity, or No-Thing.\r\nNothing, in fact, could be more _queer_, unfounded, than these ships;\r\nand the future will look back upon them with pity. Hence the simple\r\nislands, following the law: and don't think t hat their efficacy is a\r\nthing riskier than arithmetic itself.”\r\n\r\n“Good”, went Loveday. “But, Richard--captain your islands with decent\r\nmen”.\r\n\r\n“You have something on your mind: what is it?”\r\n\r\n“It is--delicate. Have I your permission to speak?”\r\n\r\n“Why, John, yes”.\r\n\r\n“Well then--is O'Hara to be an Admiral?”\r\n\r\n“Old Pat? Hardly, I think. He may. But no--I don't think. Poor\r\nold talky-talky. He has worked hard for us, John: and his fund of\r\nexperience, in one way and another, has been invaluable. Well, I don't\r\nknow: I have had the idea, but I don't suppose that, in reality--Still,\r\nI am fond of him, John. Such a tongue, and such a versatile brain, is\r\nhe! He was my comfort for many a sombre day in prison--”\r\n\r\nListening near with rancid grin behind some greenery, O'Hara kept\r\nnodding emphatic assents of satisfaction to Hogarth's praise.\r\n\r\n“But, stop”, said Loveday: “do you know why he was in prison?”\r\n\r\n“He was innocent”.\r\n\r\n“Of what?”\r\n\r\n“Of stealing some diamonds entrusted him by the Pope”.\r\n\r\n“Bah! he lies. His trial was a _cause célèbre_, and hence the false name\r\nhe gave me at first: the moment I heard you say 'O'Hara' I knew the man.\r\nHe had committed an assault upon a lady in a train--”\r\n\r\n“Beast that he is”, went Hogarth, while O'Hara's eyes started from his\r\nhead: “and liar, too, it seems. Ha!--he gave me the most circumstantial\r\nstory. Why didn't you tell me this before?”\r\n\r\n“It was delicate--”\r\n\r\n“Beast that he is. Yet how complex is character! the man's tenderness\r\nfor his Church is so charming--”\r\n\r\n“Fiddlesticks! Look here, Richard, I am come all the way from Westring\r\nto tell you this thing. Don't you give vast powers to that man: it\r\nisn't decent; and I have a feeling that it will be a baleful piece\r\nof weakness. And don't get easy, and tolerant, and fat in the eyes,\r\nHogarth. That is a very significant Bible-story--the implacable disaster\r\nsent upon old Eli for no greater crime than a _bonhomme_ indolence.\r\nAnd in order to arouse your wrath against this O'Hara, I am going now,\r\nagainst my will, to tell you something: the name of that lady in that\r\ntrain”.\r\n\r\n“Someone whom I know?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”.\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Loveday's answer hesitated: and in that moment, O'Hara,\r\nwith lightning decision, had his mouth at Hogarth's ear: “Come with me\r\nquick--then fall down and worship me for a month! _Someone is in the\r\nMalachite Hall!_”\r\n\r\nLike sudden death Hogarth's colour fled his face; in another instant he\r\nwas a blind, oblivious wight...had known that she was in Petersburg; but\r\nnot that she was at the masque.\r\n\r\nIn a moment shrubbery, lights, all life, rushed into transformation\r\nfor him: and with an excitement of the eyes, the bloodshot left looking\r\nbloodier, he went after O'Hara, tossing back at Loveday that fatal\r\nsaying: “_To-morrow_....”\r\n\r\nA little previously O'Hara, having got from Frankl details of Rebekah's\r\ndress, had spotted her in primrose silk, black mask and domino, and\r\nsoon with Hogarth refound her in the crush: whereas Hogarth went about\r\nprospecting over the crowd, with that excitement of his red-veined\r\neyeballs, once even entered into talk with a group of four diplomatists,\r\nbut all the time with eyeballs absent in hankering tracking, out\r\nprowling after one morbid form, as the stallion's prowls after his\r\nSally.\r\n\r\nAfter an hour she said in French over her shoulder: “Why follow me?”\r\n\r\nAnd as he bowed compliance, she added: “Are you well?”\r\n\r\nHe said: “Yes”, and bowed, and she nodded twice, smiling a little, as\r\nthey parted.\r\n\r\nHe, on the wings of exaltation, made haste to salute the Throne and\r\nleave the palace, rushing toward solitude to brood upon that smile,\r\nthose familiar nods, and the gentle “Are you well?”--in his landau with\r\nhim O'Hara, who persecuted him even to his bedroom; and when, after\r\nan hour, the priest at last reappeared in a corridor, the night-lights\r\nthere shone upon an exultant visage, like a climber's who, after long\r\nclamberings, at last stamps on the Matterhorn, and looks abroad.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered his own room, he stood with a hung head, till, sharply\r\nlooking up, he ejaculated with amazed, realization and opening arms:\r\n“Well, it's done!--I've got it!” Now he put forefinger to nose, and cut\r\na beastly face at himself in the mirror-wall.\r\n\r\nThe next day Hogarth rather guiltily said to Loveday: “Well, I have\r\npromised old O'Hara the _Mahomet_ for the Straits. Don't frown--I owe\r\nhim something, and the clever beast got over me in crazy moment”.\r\n\r\n“Quite so”, Loveday coldly said: and thenceforth, the thing being done,\r\nwas mum as to the name of the lady connected with O'Hara's crime.\r\n\r\nHe returned immediately to England, having there many occupations, which\r\nmultiplied as the islands everywhere neared completion, the first of the\r\nlaunches taking place at Spezzia on the 7th of February.\r\n\r\nA fortnight before this event the Beech-fever had revived, the coming\r\nlaunch being no secret, and the doubt whether “Beech's Folly” might\r\nbe no folly, and the question what, on the whole, Beech's Folly might\r\nreally bode, filled once more the consciousness of the Western world. By\r\nthe 1st of February a drop was recorded in many general securities, in\r\n“governments”, rentes, and consols; in Berlin the bank-rate rose one per\r\ncent.; it was stated that specie was accumulating in European vaults;\r\nwhile up leapt futures-cotton in the Liverpool market. At last the\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury, in a speech at Manchester, gave sign of the\r\nGovernment's consciousness of the new fact, saying that he could only\r\nrepeat the answer given by the First Lord of the Admiralty to the recent\r\nDeputations of the Chamber of Shipping and of Merchant Shippers, that\r\nBritain and the other maritime nations would know how to protect the\r\nseas from any nuisance. He anticipated no nuisance. The structures\r\npopularly known as “Beech's Folly” (prolonged laughter) would be\r\nprovided with lighthouses: and until they proved a nuisance on the\r\nocean's fairways, the Governments must permit to private enterprise\r\nthat free hand which was the characteristic of our age; moreover, a\r\nrecognized Government had avowed its association with these structures.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the fever heightened. The light-system of the _Boodah_,\r\nnow included in the usual alphabetical lists of derelicts, was conned\r\nby thousands of mariners, while in the crowded captains', underwriters',\r\nand committee rooms at Lloyd's discussion buzzed and speechified in\r\nevery tone of gravity. Suddenly in the F. G. and S. clause marine\r\ninsurance underwent a profound modification; and it was then that the\r\nmillionaire, Schroeder, at that time a German clerk in the City,\r\nmanaged to borrow five thousand pounds, and quickly cleared his pile by\r\nunderwriting on larger F. C. and S. terms. And again raged the sale of\r\nthe islands as penny salt-cellars, finger-basins, etc.; in broker's\r\nand sub-editor's office the tape-machine clicked the hourly progress of\r\npreparations at Spezzia; while every by-street was dreadful with that\r\nmusic-hall chorus:\r\n\r\n  “To Spezzia runs the Pullman train;\r\n   The Follies soon their sense will teach;\r\n  We've Beech, O dear, upon the brain,\r\n   He brains upon the beach”.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the question of the drawing-room was “Are you going to\r\nSpezzia?” and by the 7th so great a pilgrimage of tourists--experts,\r\nidlers, cinematographers, special correspondents, ministers of state,\r\nYankees, officers, social stars--had flocked to the scene, that\r\naccommodation failed in the town and surrounding hill-country, from Le\r\nGrazie on the west, to Lerici on the east of the Gulf.\r\n\r\nThe morning dawned bright--Italian sky, tranquil Italian sea--and by\r\nnine the harbour was alive with small-craft and Portovenere steamboats,\r\nall gala with flags; on the land side, too, over the hills, up the old\r\nroad called Giro della Foce, and before the villages commanding the\r\ntown, spread a cloud of witnesses; while the multitude in possession\r\nof _permessos_ for the dock-region stretched across a hundred and sixty\r\nacres, perched on every coign, and murmuring like the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd all in the air a fluttered consciousness of the to-come, the present\r\nnothing, an hour hence everything--like the suspense of nature before\r\ngales, and that greatness and novelty of marriage-mornings: for such a\r\nbride that day would rush to the brine as it had never embraced.\r\n\r\nThere lay the hulk, all nuptial in colours, her roof looking like a\r\n_plaza_ of Lima or La Paz at Carnival, flags in mountain-ridges\r\nround her edges, flags in festoons, in slanting clothes-lines, in\r\ntrophy-groups, on bandroled poles, bedecking her; some scaffolding still\r\nround her; and three running derricks, capable of wielding guns and\r\nboilers of 140 tons, craned their shears about her. A temporary stair\r\nunder flags ran right up to a ledge above the waterline: from which\r\nledge little steel steps led here and there to the roof; round the edge\r\nof roof and ledge running two balustrades, surrounding the hulk; and\r\nover that upper portion, four times repeated in white letters ten feet\r\nhigh, the name _BOODAH_ boomed itself.\r\n\r\nBy eleven some seven hundred people stood and sat on the roof--the\r\n_élite_ of Europe, invited to the luncheon after the launch, seeming to\r\nthe tract of on-lookers quite dainty and visionary there, like objects\r\nmirrored in an eye. And they formed groups, of which some chatted, and\r\nwere elegant, and some spoke the gravest words uttered for centuries.\r\n\r\n“What, really, is the _Boodah_?” asked a Servian Minister of a French:\r\n“is she a whim, a threat, or a tool?”\r\n\r\n“She is too heavy for a whim”, answered the French, “too dear for a\r\nthreat, and too fantastic for a tool. Time will show”.\r\n\r\nBut this was no answer at all: something more to the point came from a\r\nmultitudinous tumult of sledges below--the workmen “wedging-up”.\r\n\r\nAt last, soon after noon, Hogarth, with a considerable following, was\r\nseen ascending the steps, on his arm the Queen of the Ceremony--a\r\nlittle Bavarian Gräfin, famous for her face: he, princely now with\r\nthat cosmopolitan polish picked up in Courts, bending above her with\r\nlaughter, making her laugh also, as they paced up. And at once the\r\ninvited, including the Board of Verification, entered the hull upon a\r\ntour of sight-seeing, conducted by a manager of the contractors.\r\n\r\nAlready the set-up wedges had raised the _Boodah_ from her keel-block,\r\nand left her resting on the great braced ground-ways; and now down to\r\nthe sea's brink the greasers were busy, prodigals in tallow, while,\r\nwithin, the seven hundred trooped from spectacle to spectacle, like a\r\ntourist group guided through the Louvre.\r\n\r\nAn hour, and they anew appeared on the roof, trooping toward that\r\nbalustrade that faced the sea: upon which the throngs felt the impending\r\nof the event, and intently watched. But there seemed no hurry, Hogarth\r\nall gay chatter, anon lowering the lids a moment, as he looked over the\r\nwater; till suddenly hundreds of glasses detected a champagne-bottle\r\nwith ribbons in the christener's hand; and the consciousness of the\r\nmoment come moved the hosts when Hogarth, even as he chatted, disengaged\r\na flag, and let it fall: it was a signal; down it fluttered; and\r\ninstantly, down there, bustle broke loose, as the call “Saw-off!” went\r\nforth, and the saws set flurriedly to fret through the timbers which\r\nbind groundways to slidingways.\r\n\r\n“_Now?_” whispered Hogarth at the christener's ear: and, even as he\r\nspoke, the voice of a noising arose and droned from Spezzia, its hills,\r\nits villages, and its sea; the _Boodah_, only half-liberated,\r\nstrained in travail; crashed from her bands; slipped down the greased\r\ngradient--plunged--and, gathering momentous way, went wading deep,\r\ndeeper--like Behemoth run mad--amid a wrath of froths and a brawling of\r\nwaters, into the sea.\r\n\r\nThere, deep-planted, she stretched: on the surface appeared a reef of\r\nsteel; and the stirred-up water slapped vapidly upon those flanks, like\r\nwaters upon the Norway wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\n\r\nREEFS OF STEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing was ever so scrutinized as the movements of the _Boodah_ during\r\nthe next two months.\r\n\r\nOne morning three weeks after her launch three steamers took her in tow,\r\nwith progress so slow, that at nightfall they were still visible from\r\nland; but the next morning had vanished.\r\n\r\nTwo days later they were met on the Genoa-Leghorn _route_, six steamers\r\nthen towing the _Boodah_, their course S. by W.\r\n\r\nAgain and again it was met, that funeral of the sea: the prone, tearing\r\nsteamers, the reluctant bulk. Sometimes a captain's glass might make out\r\na few men lost on the roof like men on a raft, smoking, seated, leaning\r\nover a balustrade.\r\n\r\nSouthward and westward it swam. On the seventh day there arrived at\r\nAjaccio from Marseilles twenty-five bluejackets; and these, in a hired\r\n_speronare_, put to sea, and joined the _Boodah_ twenty miles from the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThenceforth, a smoke would be seen at a point of the roof, indicating\r\nthat she, too, was steaming: for it was known that she had a screw and\r\na rudder; and so closely was she observed, that her now added rate could\r\nbe fixed--two to three knots a day.\r\n\r\nShe must therefore have some small engines about 4,000 H. P.: and since\r\ntheir _motif_ could only be one thing, resistance to ocean currents,\r\nthis meant that the _Boodah_ was intended to rest always in one spot: a\r\nstartling conclusion.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a Surveying Service warship would peep above the horizon,\r\nwatching her.\r\n\r\nAs she passed through the Straits, seventy-five English blue-jackets put\r\nout from Trafalgar, and joined her.\r\n\r\nWith such reports passed the weeks. Occasionally five or six coal-ships\r\nwould be seen about the _Boodah_; her number of tug-ships might be as\r\nlow as two; sometimes nine, ten.\r\n\r\nAt night she made a fine display, and homeward-bound boats from\r\nCape Horn, from Pernambuco, Para, Madeira, spoke highly of her two\r\nrevolving-drum lighthouses: for these, from opposite corners of the\r\nroof, at the rate of a revolution per minute, poured into space\r\ntwo shimmering comets, like Calais and the Eddystone--rapt\r\nspinning-dervishes of the sea that hold far converse with the dark,\r\ntill morning. And between these two ran a festoon of electric lanterns,\r\nJapanese and Moorish, cut in ogives; and festoons of coloured moons\r\ndrooped round the balustrades, so that the blaze and complexity of it\r\npresented to ships a spectacle of speckled mystery, fresh to the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter five weeks a hundred and seventeen blue-jackets put out from\r\nPortsmouth in a chartered barque and joined her, she still in tow,\r\nmaking now about N. by W.\r\n\r\nBut by the time this news reached Europe the eyes of Europe were no\r\nlonger given up to the _Boodah_: for _another Boodah_, called the\r\n_Truth_, was a-tow through the North Channel from Belfast; and she\r\nhad not reached the Mull of Cantire, when a third was launched at San\r\nFrancisco, so that the interest of the islands became complicated.\r\n\r\nWhat would they do? What could they? Compared with this question, the\r\nriddle of the Sphinx was simple, the supposition that they were going\r\nto batter coast-walls in the S. Pacific being hardly now tenable. The\r\n_Boodah_ finally came to rest some miles North of lat. 50° and East of\r\nlong. 20°: and there--just on the northern rim of the Gulf Stream where\r\nit divides, part toward Ireland, and part toward Africa--she remained,\r\nprecisely in the middle of the trade-route between Europe and Boston,\r\nNew York, Halifax: a _route_ covered for fifty miles--twenty-five north,\r\ntwenty-five south--by her 19.5-inch guns.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe with how wild a heart, or thrilling a\r\nboding, the world heard this thing: eight days later the International\r\nConference of Maritime Nations met at The Hague.\r\n\r\nBut nothing happened--or the opposite of what was feared: for, as months\r\npassed, the _Boodah_, planted there in the ocean, rapidly became the\r\nrecognized gathering-point of the fashion and gaiety of Europe, thither\r\nflocking the socially ambitious and the “arrived” together, and to have\r\nbeen invited to those revels of taste and elegance became a superiority.\r\nGradually, as the names “Beech”, “Ecuador”, ceased to be associated\r\nwith the islands, the name of Hogarth took their place; and Hogarth had\r\nengaged Wanda, sweetest of tenors, to a year's stay in the _Boodah_,\r\nwhose orchestra was the most cultured anywhere; Roche, her _chef_, had\r\ntwo years previously been put into a laboratory to devote his soul to\r\nthe enlargement of his art; and he and that tenor lived in suites of the\r\n_Boodah_ such as most princes would consider Utopian.\r\n\r\nHardly anything in her interior suggested _the ship_: no hammocks for\r\nmarines, rolling-racks, sick-bay, lockers, steam-tables, wash-rooms, she\r\nbeing just a palace planted in the Atlantic, her bottom going down to\r\na layer of comparative calm, so that hardly ever, in a storm, when the\r\nocean robed her sides in white, washed abroad her slippery plateau, and\r\ndrenched with spray her lighthouse tops, did the ballroom below know\r\nshock or motion. Into her principal hall, far down, circular, one\r\ndescended by a circle of steps of marble, round which stood a colonnade\r\nof Cuban cedar, supporting candelabra and silks; and from atrium-pools\r\nsunk in the floor twelve twining fountains brandished spiral sprays, the\r\nfloor being of a glassy marble, polished with snakestone, suffused\r\nwith blushes at the coloured silks and at a roof gross with rose and\r\npomegranates, hanging chandeliers; round the raised centre of the floor\r\nstood two balustrades, three feet high, hung with silks, the inner\r\ncircle thirty feet across, higher than the outer, forty-five across: a\r\nroseate room, strewn with cushions, colours, flushes; but that raised\r\nspace was empty: reserved for--a throne.\r\n\r\nThe throne, still unfinished, had been three years making in India.\r\n\r\nAnd during nine months the _élite_ and joyous yachts arrived, not at\r\nthe _Boodah_ only, but at others of the twelve which, one by one,\r\nwere launched and towed to position; and a round of events transacted\r\nthemselves in the fortresses: Marie Antoinette balls, classic\r\nconcerts, theatrical functions by _troupe_ or amateur, costume-balls,\r\nchildren's-balls, banquets of the gods, grave receptions. By now there\r\nran right across the _Boodah's_ roof, in the form of a cross, two double\r\ncolonnades of Doric pillars, at the four ends being Roman arches: and\r\nhere, some summer afternoon, the passing ship would see a bazaar, all\r\nbutterfly flutter, feminine hues like flower-beds, cubes of\r\ncoloured ice, flags, and a buzz of gaiety, and strains of Tzigany\r\nmusic--rainbow-tints of Venice mixed with the levity of the Andrássy\r\nUt of Pesth. Sometimes a fleet of craft would surround the islands.\r\nBesides, to each was attached a yacht, and a trawler which continually\r\nplied for it between island and land.\r\n\r\nAt this time Hogarth was deep in debt, and Beech's living upon credit.\r\n\r\nSo, gradually, a good deal of the awe which the structures had\r\ninspired passed off. On the whole, they seemed mere whimsical\r\ncastles-of-pleasure. The trains of industrious ships grew habituated\r\nto their gaudy brightness by night, to their seething reefs, or placid\r\nmass, by day. On foggy days the mariner was aware of the islands wailing\r\nweird siren-sounds of warning. The islands waved common-code signals\r\nof greeting to the passer. Trinity House sent them the usual blanks and\r\ninstruments for recording meteorological observations. Their positions\r\nwere marked in British Admiralty Charts, in American Pilot Charts, in\r\n“Sailing Directions”. The great greyhounds, racing to Sandy Hook, raved\r\nwith jest past them. The islands began to seem a natural part of the\r\nsum of things. There they lay, stable, rooted, trite, familiar; and\r\nthe question almost arose: “How came it that they were never there\r\n_before?_”--just that object, of that form and colour, seemed so old and\r\nnatural in that particular spot. So the frogs hopped finally upon the\r\nlog that God sent them for sovereign.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the more thoughtful of men did not fail to observe, and never\r\nforgot, that no ship could possibly depart from, or arrive at Europe,\r\nwithout passing within range of some one of the islands' guns. A row of\r\neight lay an irregular crescent (its convexity facing Europe) from just\r\noutside the Straits of Gibraltar, where O'Hara admiraled the _Mahomet_,\r\nto the 55th of latitude, where the _Goethe_ lay on the Quebec-Glasgow\r\n_route_: these commanding the European trade with the States and with\r\nS. America, as well as with W. and S. Africa, and with Australia by Cape\r\nHorn; another in the narrows of the Gulf of Aden, commanding the world's\r\ntraffic by Suez with the East and with S. Africa; another in the middle\r\nof the narrows of the Kattegat, commanding all Baltic trade; another,\r\nfifteen miles from San Francisco, and another a hundred and fifty\r\nmiles from Nagasaki, on the edge of the Black Stream, commanding the\r\nJapanese-San Francisco, the Australian-San Francisco trades, and great\r\npart of the Japano-Russo-Chinese. These were the principal trades of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLike the despair of Samson awaking manacled and shaven, an occasional\r\nshriek would go up from some lone thinker, who perceived that the\r\nkingdoms of the world had lapsed into a single hand; and in the privy\r\ncabinet the governors drank to the dregs the cup of trembling. But their\r\nspeech was bold, the matter hung long, the peoples ignored and wrought:\r\nthere was seed-time and harvest; the newsboy brawled; the long street\r\nroared. Far yonder in the darkness and distance of the deep the islands\r\nflashed and danced, and were fashionable.\r\n\r\nRichard Hogarth held back his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE “KAISER”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the habit of Hogarth, when in the _Boodah_, to rise very early\r\nand ascend in flannels to one of the four doors opening upon the\r\nledge--blocks five feet thick, moved by hydraulic motors--and sometimes\r\nLoveday would accompany these walks, they always seeing on the plane\r\nof the sea some sail, or by a spyglass the fading light-beam of the\r\n_Goethe_ north, of the _Solon_ south; or they watched how the _Boodah's_\r\ngalaxy, too, waxed faint and garish as some drama of colour evolved\r\nin the East; saw gulls hover and swing, fins wander: and marking that\r\nsimple ampleness of the plan of sea and arch of heaven, their hearts\r\nfelt enlargement.\r\n\r\nOne morning, the 3rd October, Loveday was up even before Hogarth, having\r\nstarted awake from a gory nightmare, this altogether not being a day\r\nlike others: and when the two friends met on the ledge, they walked a\r\nlong time in silence.\r\n\r\nOnly after the dayspring began definitely to dabble in its chromatic\r\nchemistries Loveday at last remarked: “Did you ever think why I took\r\nsuch pains to get you to come down with me to Lord Woolacot's last\r\nautumn two years?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”, answered Hogarth: “you wanted me to see the model farms, and how\r\nthe young ladies fed the poor, and how the tenants loved their lord, and\r\neveryone thought himself happy. Only, I didn't see what the pastimes of\r\nLord Woolacot's daughters have to do with the process of the suns, and\r\nwith the woe of Oldham. Ah, Lord, it is a job, I tell you, pulling this\r\nvile thing straight! Of course, the eagle doesn't blink: but I am\r\nonly one man, and the world, and its stupid sins, are a tidy burden.\r\nHa!--never mind. Look at that big _Boodah_ of a sun how he blooms: isn't\r\nhe launched and handled all right? Let us of this desert bend the knee\r\nto him like the old Sabæans. There is hope”....\r\n\r\nIt was known that on that day, at half-past eleven A.M., the _Kaiser\r\nWilhelm der Grösste_ would pass on her second voyage within some\r\nmiles of the _Boodah_, this ship being the greatest afloat, having a\r\ncargo-carrying deadweight of 45,000 tons, and travelling the waters like\r\na railway-train at 37 miles (32 knots).\r\n\r\nSo toward noon Hogarth, in a peaked cap, jacket, and white boots, was\r\nagain on the roof, a glass and book of Costonlights in his hand, while\r\nnot far off a knot of five officers in frockcoats talked, and near\r\none light-house, where a number of men stood, a flagstaff flew the\r\nensign--blue letters “R. F.” on a white ground, looking Russian; on the\r\nnorthern horizon two fox-tails of smoke; on the western three diminutive\r\nsails; between the two, quite real and big, a brig becalmed; and now the\r\n_Kaiser Wilhelm_: for that yonder could be only she, with so fervent a\r\ngrowth, from the first moment of her upward climb, did she approach.\r\nIt was twenty minutes to noon, and she was somehow a little late, that\r\npunctual strong wrestler with space.\r\n\r\nThe officers on the _Boodah_ spoke of her in low and stealthy voices;\r\nlooked at her with queer and stealthy glances.\r\n\r\n“'As a bird to the snare...'” muttered one.\r\n\r\n“She comes all right, but will never go”, said another.\r\n\r\n“She will be always near us”, said a third.\r\n\r\n“Life is an earnest thing, after all”, said a fourth: “there are wrongs,\r\nit seems, which only blood can wash out: it comes to that at last”.\r\n\r\nNow Loveday ran up, looking scared and busy, a quill behind his ear,\r\nHogarth now having the glass at his face, while his eyes struggled with\r\nthe reek from his cigar-end.\r\n\r\n“Is that she?” Loveday asked him.\r\n\r\n“Yes, poor boat”.\r\n\r\nShe was nine miles away; in four minutes she was less than seven, and\r\nnow distinct:--her three staysails; her four funnels; the stretched-out\r\nspace between her raked masts; her host of cowls and boats; her high\r\nvictorious hull, silently running.\r\n\r\nAnd all along her lines were lines of faces thick as dahlia-rows in\r\nJune--globe-trotters; captains of industry; children; the Wall Street\r\noperator who plotted a stroke in Black-Sea wool, and to him time was\r\nmoney--I guess; commercial travellers, all-modern, spinning, prone, to\r\nwhom the sea was an insignificant and conquered thing; engineers; capped\r\nenthusiastic Germans, going forth to conquer; publishers, ladies, lords,\r\nall the nondescript prosperous: and all ran there blithe, sublime,\r\nand long drawn-out; and they toyed with oranges, nuts; and they\r\nlooked abroad to see the _Boodah_--ship's-surgeons and officers with\r\nthem--jesting, as they munched or sucked.\r\n\r\nBut the Captain who had often seen the _Boodah_, was log-writing in the\r\nchart-room...\r\n\r\nAs her ensign of greeting ran up her main, her clocks struck twelve,\r\nthe full noon--like an omen--come; she not then three miles from the\r\n_Boodah_.\r\n\r\nAnd simultaneously with the hoisting of that ensign, and the striking of\r\nthose clocks, the old-worn wheels of Roman Civilization stopped dead.\r\n\r\nThe _Boodah_ ran up the signal: “_Stop!_”\r\n\r\nThose who understood rubbed their eyes: it was like a vision at high\r\nnoon; they could not believe.\r\n\r\nAt that news the Captain, a handsome fair-bearded man, rushed like a\r\nmadman from pilot-house to bridge, and the startled passengers saw his\r\nlighted eyes. He had some moments of indecision; then down he, too, rang\r\nthat word: “_Stop_”.\r\n\r\nThe engines left off; the _Kaiser's_ speed, as from heart-failure, gave\r\nin, died away.\r\n\r\nBy this time all the passengers knew, in a state of tremor saw confused\r\nrunnings to and fro, and face caught from face dismay; the voyage was\r\nspoiled, the record! What, then, had happened to the world? And now\r\nagain the _Boodah_ is signalling: “_Let the Captain come_”.\r\n\r\nThe Captain's hands were shaking; he could not speak, could only gasp\r\nto the first-officer: “By God, no; O, by God, no”. Then, as great\r\nquantities of black-grey reek, wheeling all convolved, were now\r\nenveloping the vessel, resting on the sea, reaching away in thinner fog\r\neven to the _Boodah_, and as, the day being calm, there was a difficulty\r\nin reading the flags, the Captain gasped: “Take the trumpet--ask\r\nthem--But don't they pay for this...?”\r\n\r\nSo out brayed the trumpeted query, and back the inexorable trumpeted\r\nanswer: “_Let the Captain come_”.\r\n\r\nSo, then, the _Kaiser_ would never reach Sandy Hook? To put out\r\nboats!--to parley!--while the earth span with quick-panting throbs,\r\nevery second worth seven thousand pounds!\r\n\r\n“But don't they _pay_ for it...?” so, with a painful face of care, the\r\nCaptain questioned space.\r\n\r\nBut he would be mild and patient as a lamb that day! His order\r\nwent forth: the ship forged ahead; a longboat, hurriedly lowered to\r\nstarboard, was manned for the first-officer to put off in her, while\r\nevery heart of the passengers thumped, every face an ecstasy of\r\nemotions.\r\n\r\nThen a wretched, long interval...\r\n\r\nThe ship's-officers were received on the _Boodah_ in a deck-room\r\ncontaining a number of boats with castored keels, capable of being\r\nquickly launched down an incline, where Mr. F. Quilter-Beckett, the\r\nAdmiral, with some lieutenants, awaited them at a bureau on which lay\r\ndocuments, while in the background stood Hogarth and Loveday, and,\r\n“Gentlemen, this is a most damned wild piece of madness!” broke out\r\nwrathfully the first-officer, as he dashed up wild-eyed to the level:\r\n“in consideration of the guns you have in this thing--”\r\n\r\n“But your Captain?” asked Quilter-Beckett, a courtly man, with a\r\ndark-curling beard, a star on his breast.\r\n\r\n“The Captain won't come!” whined the officer in perfect English:\r\n“I suppose you realize the terrible consequences of this stoppage,\r\ngentlemen?”\r\n\r\n“But you are wasting time, sir. You represent your Captain?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, I represent--!”\r\n\r\n“Then just cast your eye over this”--that so slighted letter, sent years\r\nbefore by Hogarth to Foreign Offices, claiming the sea as his private\r\nmanor.\r\n\r\nThe officer read it half through with flurried closeness; then, “Well,\r\nbut what is all this?” he broke out: “is it a piece of comedy, or what,\r\ngentlemen?”\r\n\r\n“It is serious; and the last clause comes into operation to-day: only\r\nsuch ships being held authorized to pass on the sea as pay to the\r\nfirst-reached sea-fort on any voyage a tax, or sea-rent, of 4s. per ton\r\non their registered tonnage, with an additional stamp-tax of 33s. 4d.\r\nfor receipt, and a stamp-tax of £1 16s. 8d. for clearance. You will\r\nsee at a glance the clauses of the law, if you cast your eyes over this\r\nschedule--”\r\n\r\n“Law!” the other broke in: “you talk of _Law_! But doesn't the sea,\r\nthen, belong by right to all men--?”\r\n\r\n“Not more than the land. Ask yourself: why should it? But I do hope you\r\nwon't argue: your time must be so precious”.\r\n\r\nOut shrilled the _Kaiser Wilhelm's_ whistle of recall.\r\n\r\n“I must go!” said the officer with a worried hand-toss: “I must go. If\r\nyou give me those documents, I will show them to the Captain--but he\r\nis not the sort of man--this is mere piracy, after all! But, good God,\r\ngentlemen, if you only dare touch that ship, I shouldn't put myself in\r\nyour place this day week for all--”\r\n\r\nHe snatched the papers, dashed, and his men, in a passion of haste, lay\r\nto the oars, the _Kaiser_ only four hundred yards from the _Boodah_;\r\nand the officer, shaking aloft the documents, pitched up the stair, the\r\ncentre of five hundred pairs of scared eyes, while the captain bored his\r\nway to him.\r\n\r\nTwo minutes of intense low speech, crowded with gestures: and suddenly\r\nthe Captain's face, till now haggard, reddened; out went his shaken\r\nfist; with eyes blazing like lunacy, up he flew to the bridge; and now\r\nhe is bending down with howling throat: “Passengers to their berths!”\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, above the engine-room stair a bell jangled; round swung\r\nthe pointer to “_Full Ahead_”; and ere the decks were cleared of their\r\nbustle the _Kaiser_, like a back-kicking hen, scratched up under her\r\npoop a spreading pool of spume, which tossed spasmodic spray-showers and\r\nspoutings: and she stirred, stretched like a street, churned the sea,\r\nand, wheeling to reveal her receding stern, was away.\r\n\r\nBy which time Hogarth was standing at a cubical cabin of steel on the\r\nroof, with him Loveday and Quilter-Beckett, his brow puckered with\r\nwrinkles, the sun troubling his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I suppose the _chef_ is warned?”--he threw away his cigar.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, my Lord King”, Quilter-Beckett answered.\r\n\r\nAnd Loveday: “She sweats like a thoroughbred”--haggard, but assuming\r\ncalm: “few things could be more profusely expeditious”.\r\n\r\n“Ah, make phrases, John,” murmured Hogarth.... “Well, but hadn't you\r\nbetter be getting out the boats?”\r\n\r\nUpon which Quilter-Beckett stepped into the little erection, touched a\r\nbutton, and in a minute the water round the southern side was swarming\r\nwith twenty-three boats whose blue-jackets began to row toward the\r\n_Kaiser_.\r\n\r\nAnd presently, “It's no use waiting”, said Hogarth, looking in upon\r\nQuilter-Beckett: “I should mine and shell her at the same moment, if I\r\nwere you; tell them to get it in well amidships”.\r\n\r\nNow a few seconds, full of expectation, passed, the _Kaiser Wilhelm_\r\nalready two miles away: till suddenly space opened its throat in a gulf\r\nto bay gruff and hollow like hell-gate dogs; and, almost at the same\r\nmoment, close by the _Kaiser_ a column of water hopped with one humph of\r\nvenom two hundred feet on high: when this dropped back broad-showering\r\nwith it came showering a rain of wreckage; and instantly a shriek of\r\nlamentation floated over the sea, mixed with another shriek of steam.\r\n\r\nFor the moment the ship, enveloped in vapours, could not be seen; but\r\nin two minutes glimpses of her hull appeared, shewing the bluff bulge\r\nof her starboard bottom: for she leaned steeply to port with a forward\r\ncrank, her two starboard screws, now free, spinning asleep like\r\nhumming-tops. A six-inch shell, beautifully aimed, had shattered her\r\nengines, killing two stokers, and a torpedo-mine had knocked a hole nine\r\nfeet across in her port beam.\r\n\r\nBut as the _Boodah's_ boats, meanwhile, had been racing toward her, and\r\nas her own port boats were quickly out, all were got off; in fact, she\r\nfloated so long, that her ship's papers with £270,000 in specie, and\r\na few hundred-weight of mailbags were saved, and even after the boats\r\nreached the _Boodah_ she still stretched there motionless, until, with a\r\nsudden flurry, she determined to plunge.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Hogarth had the Captain in his suite, to tell him that\r\nhe did not wish any intelligence of the event to reach the world for\r\nfour days, during which passengers and crew would be his guests, and\r\nthen be sent on to America, his object, he said, being to impress\r\nthe loss of the _Kaiser_ upon the consciousness of all, by making all\r\nanxious as to her fate.\r\n\r\nSo that night her passengers danced till late, for there was no\r\nresisting the hospitality of Hogarth, or the witchery of those vistas\r\nand arcades, grand hall and lost grot, _salons_ and conservatories,\r\nthere in the dark of the ocean, or such an enchantment of music, and\r\nfabulousness of table; the host, too, pleaded prettily for himself;\r\nand now they pardoned, and now they pouted, but always they banqueted,\r\nkissed, lost themselves in visions, were charmed, and danced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\n\r\nTHE CUP OF TREMBLING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was by the merest chance that Baruch Frankl and his daughter were\r\nnot on the _Kaiser_: for Frankl was the half-nephew of Mrs. Charles P.\r\nStickney, a New York Jewess, and as the marriage of Miss Stickney\r\nwith Lord Alfred Cowern was only fifteen days off, Frankl had made\r\narrangements to accompany the bridegroom across, but had been detained\r\nby stress of business; happily for him--for Lord Alfred, the bridegroom,\r\nwas a dancing prisoner in the _Boodah_.\r\n\r\nEarly, then, on the third morning thence, Charles P. Stickney, the\r\nbride's father, a natty little Yankee, hurried a-foot to the Maritime\r\nExchange: for, to his infinite surprise, the _Kaiser's_ arrival had\r\nnot been in the morning's paper: so the little arch-millionaire stepped\r\ntoward Beaver Street, sure that the _Kaiser_ had come in too late for\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\nEarly as it was, he found the place as thickly a-buzz as though it was\r\nthat feverish hour between eleven and twelve.\r\n\r\nHe pushed his way to the bulletin-board, inscribed with the hours at\r\nwhich ships are sighted and entered into dock: the Kaiser was not there:\r\nand with prone outlook he went seeking an assistant superintendent; but,\r\nsighting a fellow-operator, come, as usual, to digest the world, from\r\nbarometer-reports to coffee-quotations at Rio, Charles P. Stickney cried\r\nto him: “Funny about the _Kaiser_! Know anything?”\r\n\r\n“It's the darndest thing...” mumbled the other, still star-gazing at a\r\nblackboard prices-current of American staples: “raise Hell this day, I\r\nguess”....\r\n\r\nAnd on through the rooms Stickney shouldered: all in the air here\r\nan odour of the sea, and of them that go down to it in ships; pilot,\r\ncaptain, supercargo, purser; abstracts from logs, copies of manifests\r\nand clearances, marks and numbers of merchandise, with quantities,\r\nshippers, consignees; here peaked caps, and the jaw that chewed once,\r\nand paused long, and, lo, it moved anew; Black Books, massive volumes\r\nenshrining ancient wrecks; vast newspaper-files in every tongue; records\r\nof changes in lightships, lights, buoys, and beacons, from Shanghai\r\nto Cape Horn; reports, charts, atlases, globes; the progress of\r\nthe rebellion in Shantung, and the earthquake last night in Quito;\r\ndirectories, and high-curved reference-books, and storm-maps; every\r\nminute the arrival of cipher cablegrams, breathless with the day's\r\nAmsterdam exchange on London, or with the quantities of tea _in\r\ntransitu_ via Suez or Pacific Railway; and the drift of ocean-currents,\r\nand the latest position of the _Jane Richardson_, derelict, and\r\nthe arrival of the _Ladybird_ at Bahia; and the probabilities of\r\nwind-circulation, atmospheric moisture, aberrations of audibility\r\nin fog; and in the middle of it the pulse of the sun, the thundering\r\nengines and shooting shuttles of this Loom; a tiptop briskness and\r\nbustle of action; a scramble of wits; a _mêlée_ to the death; mixed with\r\npea-jackets, and aromas of chewed pigtail, and a rolling in the gait.\r\n\r\nInto this roar of life that word _Kaiser_ stole: and it grew to a\r\nchorus.\r\n\r\nCharles P. Stickney, butting upon a tearing clerk who was holding aloft\r\na bulletin of icebergs and derelicts, tried to stop him: upon which\r\nthe clerk, who would not be stopped, cried with a back-looking face of\r\npassionate haste: “London message just received--_no intelligence of\r\nKaiser_--”\r\n\r\nBut he had hardly disappeared, when another man from an inner room\r\nrushed, waving something: the Navesink Highlands lookout had wired the\r\n_Kaiser_ in sight! And while the Exchange rang with cheers, Stickney, a\r\ncolour now in his sere cheeks, went boring his way outward.\r\n\r\nThe lookout had said it--those blue eyes that never failed there on his\r\nwatch-tower, he knowing the ships that sail the sea as the Cyclops his\r\nsheep, in his heart so knowing them all, that as that sea-glass detected\r\na speck on the horizon, those sea-wise nostrils sniffed its name: for\r\nbetween the _Mary Jane_ and the _Mary Anne_, both off-shore schooners,\r\nis all the world of difference: if you would not see it, _he_ knows. And\r\nhe had wired the _Kaiser!_--so expectant his outlook: and that day wept\r\nlike a ruined man.\r\n\r\nSwift upon his first wire a second flashed: and one of those craped days\r\nof the tragedies of commerce followed, the boding, the loss, flashed\r\neverywhere, pervading Europe and America.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Exchange, all the exchanges, the Lloyds', the\r\nbourses, were crowded from an early hour, but subdued: no news, not\r\na word; but still--there was certainty: for had the _Kaiser_ and her\r\nwireless been merely disabled, she would undoubtedly by now have been\r\nreported: she had foundered.\r\n\r\n_Foundered!_--in the serenest weather in which ship ever crossed the\r\nwater....\r\n\r\nBut at eleven the truth came: for the brig which had lain becalmed near\r\nthe _Boodah_ at the moment of the tragedy, and now was nearer England,\r\nhad flashed the news: “many of the Kaiser's passengers mutilated, many\r\ndrowned”.\r\n\r\nDeath, then, was in the pottage of Life; the air tainted with specks of\r\nblood....\r\n\r\nThat day Man, as it were, rent his garments, sitting in ashes, and to\r\nHeaven sent up a howl of fear, of anguish, and of hissing hate.\r\n\r\nThose who lacked the intelligence to feel the fear, felt the hate: every\r\ngirl, the shirt-maker, the shopman, feeling himself robbed of his very\r\nown; the Duke in the centre of his oak-lands felt it; the burglar, the\r\njunk-dweller of the Yangtse, the pariah of the Hugli. Lamentation and a\r\nvoice in Ramah, wail on wail. For God had given the sea to man, and it\r\nhad been seized by a devil.\r\n\r\nGod had also given the shore; and it, too, had been seized: but, as that\r\nhad been before their birth, they had not observed it--in such a numb\r\nsomnambulism shambles humanity.\r\n\r\nBut the theft of the sea was new and flagrant, it, and the air, being\r\nall that had remained: and a roar for vengeance--sharp, and rolled in\r\nblood--rose from the throat of man.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, when Mr. C. P. Stickney during the afternoon wired for\r\ninformation to the White House, he received the reply: “Encourage calm\r\non 'Change. Government in touch with Europe. Great naval activity. Await\r\ngood news, seven P.M.”\r\n\r\nIt was about seven P.M. that what the White House would have considered\r\nspecially good news occurred: for the _Boodah_ then telegraphed through\r\nto O'Hara's _Mahomet_ at the Straits:\r\n\r\n“B. 7651. Begins. After to-morrow (Monday) you begin taxation, as per\r\nOrder B., 7315, of 2nd inst. But if warships desire to pass out, (not\r\nin), permit, till further order. Richard. Ends”.\r\n\r\nWhich meant that if any Power, or Powers, desired to concentrate\r\nforce upon the attack of any island, the Lord of the Sea granted them\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nThe _Kaiser_ passengers had now been sent off to New York, the\r\n_Boodah's_ halls seemed the home of desolation; and, as the night\r\nadvanced, Hogarth and Loveday walked on the roof: for they could find no\r\nrest, the sky without moon or star, the sea making of three sides of the\r\n_Boodah_ a roaring reef, the wind blowing cold, they two wrapped to the\r\nnose in oilskins with sou'-westers, lashed by rages of rain and spray.\r\n\r\nYonder, to the north-west, appeared a ghost, a thing, a derelict brig,\r\ndriving downhill on the billows, like a blind man gadding aimless with\r\na crazy down-look, the rags of her one sail drumming on the gusts; and\r\nnear, nearer, within a stone's-throw of the _Boodah_, she swaggered\r\nwearily, drab Arab, doomed despondent Ahasuerus of the deep, nomad on\r\nthe nomad sea; and on into the gloom of the south-west she roamed, to be\r\nagain and again re-created by the rolling light-drum, while Hogarth with\r\na groan said: “If I were only dead! I feel to-night like a man abandoned\r\nby the Almighty”.\r\n\r\nLoveday muttered those words so loved by Hogarth:\r\n\r\n  “....this is my favoured lot,\r\n  My exaltation to afflictions high”....\r\n\r\nAnd Hogarth: “Do you know what is burdening me tonight? It is the curses\r\nwhich the world is at this moment hurling upon me: as when one man,\r\nthinking evilly of another, sticks needles into wax, and needles of pain\r\npierce the other...” a sense of evil which was deepened the next day\r\nby an ominous little accident, when one of his old gunpractice hulks\r\narrived from Bombay, bearing the throne: for as this was being conveyed\r\ninto the _Boodah_ a front leg was broken.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the world's trade went on as before: only, night and day, its\r\nships lay-to, to pay rent with threat and curse: in all only thirteen\r\nships being sunk ere sea and earth had learned the new conditions.\r\n\r\nAnd from the very first day of this taxing a deeper sense of pain and\r\nhardship pervaded the world, the Lord of the Sea now taxing at 4s. per\r\nton a world's tonnage of 29 millions, 7 1/2 millions in sailing-ships,\r\n21 1/2 millions in steamships, once in a voyage--a little less than the\r\nrevenue of Britain.\r\n\r\nSo one night he received message from O'Hara that “British Mediterranean\r\nfleet has passed through the Straits, homeward”.\r\n\r\nIt was not for nothing that the nations had allowed three weeks to\r\npass before avenging the Kaiser: soon enough the Cabinets had been in\r\nintercommunication; but in the “Concert” had occurred--a hitch.\r\n\r\nBritain had proposed the destruction of the islands in detail, the\r\nPowers to contribute weights of metal proportionate to their mercantile\r\nmarines: as a basis for calculation she had offered her force in Home\r\nand Mediterranean waters; and, this having been accepted, by the 5th\r\nships were under the pennant, and outfitting.\r\n\r\nNow, all this time, things had been in a pretty whirl: oratory from\r\npulpit, platform, stump, eyes on fire, mobs that went in haste, shrieks\r\nof newspaper passion, organized burglary, and a strange epidemic of\r\nfires: for the modern nations lived by the sea, and it was seized.\r\nMoreover, on the 6th, after a meeting at the Albert Hall, organized by\r\nthe Associated Chambers of Commerce, our Government--“Liberal”, under\r\nSir Moses Cohen--suffered a defeat of thirty-four votes on a division.\r\n\r\nAnd it was during the turmoil that ensued upon this that the German\r\nForeign Office (on the 9th) sent to the new Russian the wireless\r\n“_Bion_“-meaning--“Let us meet to discuss the subject of-England”.\r\n\r\nThat meeting took place at Konigsberg.\r\n\r\nIt was now that a fort-man--formerly a Nottingham shoemaker--landed\r\nfrom the Truth's yacht at Frederikshavn, and thence wrote to the Daily\r\nChronicle, to say, briefly, this: That, supposing the European navies\r\njoined to batter away with l5-inch guns and torpedoes at five feet of\r\nsteel, they might finally succeed in mining a hole in it; but if the\r\nthick steel happened to have still bigger guns, “_and other things_”,\r\nwith which, meantime, to batter back at the thin ships, then it would be\r\nthe ships, probably, which would get holes in them: it was a question of\r\nTime. Also he said that the islands were defended by devoted men, every\r\none of intelligence and high principle, who knew what they wanted, and\r\nmeant to have it--their shooting average being 97 per 100. He advised\r\nhis country not to try it, especially in view of certain political\r\nrumours which he had picked up in the Cattegat.\r\n\r\nThis letter, although badly spelled, aroused a sensation The “high\r\nprinciple” of the fort-men, indeed, met with bitter laughter; but its\r\nhearty patriotism, simplicity, technical knowledge, were so remarkable,\r\nthat now a doubt as to the battleship arose--and with it a gnashing\r\nof teeth. The service-clubs, the “experts”, wrote this and that; the\r\npublics poured forth letters, schemes, plots, inventions--like the brain\r\nof the world _versus_ the brain of Hogarth. “_Starve Him Out_”, was a\r\ntitle in the _Contemporary:_ but the reply was bitterly obvious. And\r\ninto the midst of this racket burst the news that the negotiations with\r\nGermany, Russia and France were at a deadlock.\r\n\r\nThese Powers had raised this question: “In case of the capture of the\r\nislands--what shall be done with those most powerful engines?”\r\n\r\nHere was a riddle. For whichever nation took even one would score a vast\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nIf, now, Britain had had the greatness of mind to declare for the\r\nsinking, in any case, of all the islands, the difficulty was solved, but\r\nthe new-Government brooms would score a point and gain a trick, and\r\nthey proposed the division of surviving forts in the proportion of\r\nfighting-power contributed.\r\n\r\nThe Continent objected: Britain was “_firm_”; whereupon the French\r\nAmbassador sent to Downing Street his withdrawal from the crusade.\r\n\r\nAnd so when--on the 22nd--the fleets assembled at Portland and Milford\r\nHaven before _rendezvous_ at the Lizard, the whole original proposal had\r\nfallen through: for here was neither tricolour nor saltire, only three\r\nGerman ships, only five Italian; the “probability”, moreover, of the\r\ncapture of a sea-fort by England was imminent: and on the evening of\r\nthe mobilisation of the squadrons feverish activity was reported from\r\nToulon; a British Legation _attaché,_, seeing fit to stroll round the\r\nCaserne Pepinière, beheld in the yard an extraordinary crowd of limbers:\r\nand, pitching into a cab, from the nearest _postes et télégraphes_ wired\r\nto London the word: “Angleterre”.\r\n\r\nToo late: the British fleets were gone, leaving the Channel and Western\r\nMediterranean desert.\r\n\r\nNow the nation awoke to a consciousness of dark skies: cloud of the west\r\nrushing to meet a yet lurider eastern--with probability of lightning.\r\n\r\nThe fleet could hardly return in less than five days--if it returned!\r\nWould the hostile nations be good enough to await its return? The\r\nlightning would be “near”.\r\n\r\nA day of fear, in which flash tracked flash: till at 11.30 P.M. the\r\nrumour pervaded the crowd round St. Stephen's that the new Ministry had\r\nsuffered defeat: and the drifting ship was captainless.\r\n\r\nAnd early the next morning a number of _Boodah_ boats, out running\r\na regatta, came tearing back, all fluttered; soon after which\r\nQuilter-Beckett was hurrying into Hogarth's presence, who was at coffee,\r\nto say: “Well, my Lord King, here they come at last--and enough of them,\r\nI think”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE “BOODAH” AND THE BATTLESHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ships had gone forth in two lines ahead at ten knots, Admiral Sir\r\nHenry Yerburgh, K.C.B., being in the flagship Queen Mary, with the\r\ncapital-ships being nearly all of the five mosquito flotillas, and half\r\nthe Home submarine; though what was the object of the torpedo craft\r\n(unless they were to go within 2,000 yards of the _Boodah's_ guns) was\r\nnot very evident.\r\n\r\nAt that news, Hogarth, putting on a wide-awake, and lighting a cigar\r\nwith rough perfunctory puffs, ran along a corridor to call Loveday,\r\nwhereupon the two went out to the ledge and up to the roof.\r\n\r\nThere, at the south edge, stood a marine trumpeting something at\r\nHogarth's yacht; and, just landing at the _Boodah_ from his gig, a\r\nfretful Yankee skipper, register in hand with a bag of £900 sea-rent in\r\ngold, while twenty yards yonder rode his smoking ship loaded with\r\ngrain for Rouen; and on the eastern horizon the armada, in crescent at\r\npresent, moving with fires banked at two knots, a glare hiding them from\r\nthe naked eye, but the glass revealing them like toys in the abstract,\r\nethereally hazy.\r\n\r\nAnd now the yacht's cones shewed steam, three of her boats making toward\r\nthe _Boodah_; soon at the landing-place stood Wanda, some interpreters,\r\nMons. Roche (the chef), women, engineers, paymasters, civil servants,\r\nwaiters, etc.; and Hogarth, seeing them, approached, questioned them,\r\nand, hearing that they had been ordered a day's pleasure-trip round the\r\n_Solon_, with lifting hat shook hands all round.\r\n\r\nBy this time some fifty officers and blue-jackets were about the roof\r\nand ledge, some discussing, others unfixing lanterns and festoons, with\r\nshouted directions. Leaving which, Hogarth and Loveday descended to an\r\noffice of Loveday's, and Hogarth was just saying: “Quilter-Beckett could\r\ndestroy a quarter of those warships yonder--_now_, if he chose--without\r\nfiring a gun--” when in, with flushed face and stretched stalk,\r\nhurried Quilter-Beckett, crying: “My Lord King, I thought you would be\r\nhere--just look--!”\r\n\r\nHe held out a Sea telegraph-form-from O'Hara:\r\n\r\n“F. 39241. Begins. Almost certainty of war: Germany, France, Russia\r\nagainst England. Three corps massing between Harfleur and Rouen,\r\ntwo upon Petersburg, transports at Havre. England undefended on sea.\r\nMinistry fallen. Toulon outfitting. Donald, Admiral. Ends.\r\n\r\nHogarth, with an all-gone gesture, handed the telegram to Loveday.\r\n\r\nBut with lightning energy he was at a desk, scribbling:\r\n\r\n“F. 39242. Begins. To Donald, Admiral, Mahomet. Be in half-hourly\r\ncommunication with Beech's Bank, Paris and Petersburg branches. Send\r\nhourly bulletins of news. War to be averted by every means. Let Beech\r\nthreaten. Warn Cattegat. Richard. Ends.”\r\n\r\nAnd “Quick, Quilter-Beckett”, he cried, “send that! What is the speed of\r\nyour quickest picket--?”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen knots--”\r\n\r\n“Then, go yourself to the British Admiral. _Make_ him fly back: he has\r\nyears to attack me in, tell him--I'll write a dispatch--”\r\n\r\nOn which Quilter-Beckett telephoned up for a picket, took the dispatch,\r\nand was soon away, while Hogarth watched his flight over the Sea.\r\n\r\nAn anxious hour passed, and by then a line of ships had been sighted to\r\nthe west--the Americans at last; ten minutes later, the picket, too, was\r\nseen returning.\r\n\r\n“Well, now”, said Hogarth, watching her, “I wonder. The ships seem to be\r\ncoming on just the same. You have no idea, John, how the mind of people\r\nin office becomes fixed, like hardened putty in a hole: I am sorry now I\r\ndidn't go myself”.\r\n\r\nSome minutes more and Quilter-Beckett was pelting up the steps, his face\r\npink as prickly-heat, blurting out: “My Lord King! I have been grossly\r\ninsulted...!”\r\n\r\n“Ha!” went Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“I met a dispatch-boat coming to make summons of surrender, and,\r\nin spite of my white flag, they took me prisoner! How I restrained\r\nmyself--and these people in the hollow of my hand! When I got at last to\r\nthe Admiral--it is Yerburgh on the _Queen Mary_--he 'pirated' me--but I\r\nhave no time Yonder, you see, are the Americans. British won't go back:\r\nI doubt if they believe--'under orders', and so on. By the way, you\r\nshouldn't stay there--no longer safe--”\r\n\r\nHe was away: for the moment was near, the _Boodah_ now surrounded with a\r\nseries of floating squares hanging deep torpedo-nets against submarines,\r\non both horizons effusions of smoke, the ships no more visions, but\r\nmiddle-sized sea-things, seeming fixed in the thick of the sea, though\r\nsteaming quickly. Hogarth watched them through a hand-glass, while\r\nLoveday, ghastly pallid, whispered: “Come, Richard, come”, but still\r\nlingered a little, seeing them grow up--like the infant, the lad, the\r\nhairy man--toiling at the bigness of the sea, looking stripped, prepared\r\nfor tempest They were six miles away--five.\r\n\r\nMute lay the _Boodah_; and, surrounding her, perniciously moved the\r\nships at forty-eight revolutions a minute, hardly a cable's interval\r\nbetween the host of them, they seeming no more the playthings of the\r\nsea, but its masters, each a travelling throne of power; and as they\r\npared so taciturn, with baleful aspect they trained their cannon upon\r\nthe sea-fort in their midst: not a soul visible on fort or ships.\r\n\r\nA long while it seems to last, that noonday stillness, a noonday breezy\r\nand oceanic, the sea sharp-edged, hard-looking, dark-blue, tossing spray\r\nalong its ridges, not rough, but restless, shewing against the ships\r\nwhite foams a moment, which silently glide away.\r\n\r\nBut their Admiral is signalling: _Let her have it!_ and in some moments\r\nmore yonder to the far north the _Florida_ breaks into quick-flashing\r\necstasy, like quick-winking Gorgon glances; and the north-east catches\r\nit in a single boom; and in ten seconds more it is as if Nature, with\r\nsudden yell, feels to her womb the birth-hour come and rueful throes:\r\nand where ships had been appears in one minute nothing but a ring of\r\nstagnant smoke, tugged into rays and out-sticking clouds, flushed with\r\nglares and rouges.\r\n\r\nAnd no question of missing: the _Boodah_ stationary and huge; every\r\nshell told. But, the deluge over, that thunder-marred visage again\r\nlooked grimly forth, a face new-risen from smallpox, an apparition,\r\nroof-houses gone, lighthouse tops, one of her great 19.5 inchers in\r\nfragments, in her casemates seventeen dead.\r\n\r\nBut where now is the one-masted _Hercules_, which but a moment\r\nsince went trembling at the bale of her own bellowing barbettes? The\r\n_Hercules_ is in a Nessus-shirt of flame. And whither the _Hercules_ is\r\ngoing, thither is the _Idaho_ going, and the _Dante_ gone, and gone the\r\nelongated length of the _Invincible_, and twenty destroyers, and the\r\nbow-works of the old _Powerful_, which stoops woefully there, screws in\r\nair, as the camel of the desert kneels and waits, while into her beam\r\ncomes crashing the ram of the poopless _Deutschland_.\r\n\r\nYet the _Boodah_ has not fired a gun!\r\n\r\nBut now she fires: as the broadsides drench her anew, she fires, the\r\nhulk--all round the horizon--lowing in travail: and as there is no\r\nquestion of missing on the one side, so on the other is assurance, the\r\n_Boodah's_ broad-sides of 19.5-inchers and 9.5-inchers, ninety-two in\r\nall, being fired by the hand of Quilter-Beckett, who sits at a table\r\ngrim with knobs, buttons, dial-faces, in a cabinet near a saloon where\r\nHogarth, Loveday, and five lieutenants are lunching; and where he sits\r\nhe can hear the band in an alcove rendering for the eaters Beethoven's\r\nNinth Symphony: hear, not heed: for two gunners in each casemate have\r\nsighted a ship through pivoted glasses, whose fixing, disturbing an\r\nelectrical circuit, prints the ship's distance on an indicator before\r\nthe Admiral: whereupon he touches a button--many buttons--in intense\r\nsuccession: the _Boodah bawls_: and the thrust-back of her resentment\r\nbecomes intolerable, the ships just like fawns under the paws of an old\r\nlion whose grisly jaws drip gore; the sharks that infest her will fare\r\nwell of her hand.\r\n\r\nOf forty-three ships fixed, thirty-nine are hit, eleven founder:\r\nwreckage so vast and swift, that the Admiral, still afloat in a _Queen\r\nMary_ pierced above-belt, is like a man stung by the tarantulas of\r\ndistraction: tries to signal flight--flags cannot be seen; fires\r\ncoloured pistol-lights: “Retire!”--and soon, all round, the circle is in\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nBut hapless flight: the _Boodah_ is an octopus whose feelers reach far,\r\nand they, within her toils, cannot escape her omnipresence. She sends\r\nafter them no guns: yet they are blown to atoms; the sea becomes a\r\ndeath-trap thick with pitfalls and shipwreck; one by one they are\r\ncaught, they fly aloft like startled fowl, or they succumb, and lean,\r\nand stoop, and sink: the sea, for mile on mile, proving a hell of\r\ntorpedoes-dirigible, automobile, mine.\r\n\r\nFor in the matter of mines the _Boodah_ had all the advantages of a\r\nshore, and as to dirigible torpedoes more than all.\r\n\r\nHer mines, whose weight was adjusted to the specific gravity of salt\r\nwater, sank till the pressure at ten fathoms arrested them, they,\r\nelectrically connected with the forts, reaching out twenty miles;\r\nand the whole network, charted to an inch, was coordinated with the\r\nrange-tables.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary l8-inch Whiteheads, moreover, were replaced by a longer\r\ndesign running 6,000 yards, the added length being occupied by the\r\nflask, whose compressed air runs the engine, they not sinking on\r\nfinishing their course: so, if they missed, there they lay, a trap of\r\n380 pounds of gun-cotton in the course of the numerous moving foe.\r\n\r\nWith these three forms of the same plague the _Boodah_ hunted the\r\nfleeing ships, and drove them stumbling through complicated miseries,\r\namazed and thunderstruck: so that seventy-three only, several of them\r\nhalf-wrecks, reached her twenty-five mile limit; and, there, over the\r\nmines of the _Solon_, reassembled.\r\n\r\nAmid the throng on his ruined roof Hogarth watched their flight and the\r\never-coming boatloads of blue-jackets through a mist of smoke and the\r\nafter-smell of war, while under the sea wide eyes in hosts were a-gaze\r\nat a windfall of 2,400 bodies.\r\n\r\nAbout half-past four captains and commanders of the survivors were in\r\nthe ward-room of the Second-in-Command on the _Orion_--the _Queen Mary_\r\ngone--when he, with splendid infatuation, proposed a return to the\r\nattack, with a change of tactics to concentration upon one side only of\r\nthe _Boodah_; but the foreigners pointed out the obvious added dangers;\r\nand in the midst of a wrangle a dispatch-boat from the _Solon_, eleven\r\nmiles south, arrived, demanding the usual sea-rent, by draft, if not in\r\ngold; so out, at this unlooked-for incident, broke a new quarrel, the\r\nBritish for a whole hour resisting the inexorable; till the _Solon_\r\nLieutenant, his eyes moist with pleading, explained their helplessness,\r\nadding that war between the four Powers had been declared that day at\r\nnoon from the Stock Exchange steps: and only then the Vice-Admiral,\r\nbreaking into tears, yielded to destiny.\r\n\r\nHogarth, meanwhile, was like a wild man, imprisoned, till his yacht\r\nreturned at dusk with her excursionists; and without delay he was on\r\nher, and away for England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\n\r\nTHE STRAITS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn England, meantime, was nothing but dismay.\r\n\r\nThe Government, whose defeat was accidental, on being hurriedly patched\r\nup, threw itself passionately into the work of defence, calling up every\r\nenrolled man, while at regimental centres the enlistment of volunteers\r\nwent forward, Weedon alone turning out 7,000 rifles a day.\r\n\r\nBut on the night of the Declaration the Under-secretary announced in the\r\nHouse that the Russians were moving down the Baltic, the French toward\r\nthe Straits: and the next morning dawned with the dreariness of last\r\nmornings and days. However, soon after 1 P.M., the Lord of the Sea\r\nlanded at Bristol, his yacht being one of the swiftest things afloat;\r\nthere heard the known facts; and thence wired to Beech's London house,\r\nto the London Foreign Office, to Cadiz and to Frederikshavn, where he\r\nhad wireless for the _Mahomet_ at the Straits, and for the _Truth_ in\r\nthe Cattegat.\r\n\r\nHis wire to the Foreign Office was as follows:\r\n\r\n“I have come to England hoping to avert European war by fiscal means,\r\nnot knowing that the passage of ships into open water was of first\r\nimportance. Since this is so, accept my assurance, there will be no\r\nwar, except on the part of Britain, which I should much resent. British\r\nGovernment, I suggest, should forthwith allay national anxiety.\r\n\r\n“RICHARD”.\r\n\r\nBut the Foreign Office did not publish this telegram, not knowing what\r\nto make of it--unless Hogarth were vehemently the friend of England,\r\nwhile every British being regarded him not so much as the enemy of man,\r\nas the special Anti-Christ of England. And how came he to be in England,\r\nwhen he should be at the bottom of the Atlantic? The telegram was passed\r\nthrough the agitated departments, but kept dark....\r\n\r\nSo the afternoon passed without news: and tension grew to agony.\r\n\r\nHogarth spent the evening in his Berkeley Square house with the Manager\r\nof Beech's, examining office-books and specimens of some new Sea-coins,\r\ntill near eleven, when, being alone, he put on a mackintosh, shaded\r\nhis face well with hat and collar-flap, and went out into the drizzling\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nEven his Berkeley Square was peopled, and, as he strolled toward Pall\r\nMall, he found it ever harder to advance, till he became jammed. Never\r\nhad he seen such a crowd, all in the air a sound, vague and general,\r\nwhich was like a steam of thought-made-audible; till presently, while\r\ntrying in vain to get away, he was startled by a tumult that travelled,\r\na rumour of woe that noised and swelled, terrifying, the voice of the\r\npeople, the voice of God: and though he did not know its meaning, it\r\nkeenly afflicted him.\r\n\r\nThe fastest of the survivors from the battle with the _Boodah_ had\r\nwirelessed: on that commonplace bulletin at the War Office the news\r\nstood written...\r\n\r\nBut the rumour of that despair had not yet attained its culmination,\r\nwhen another rumour roared after and over it, roar upon roar, like\r\ntempest poured through the multitudinous forest, joyance now overtaking\r\nsorrow, and a noise of roistering overwhelming lamentation. And all at\r\nonce a great magnetic hysteria seized them all, and the many became as\r\none, and the bursting bosom burst: men weeping like infants, laughing\r\nfoolishly, grasping each other's hand, and one cried “Hurrah!”, and\r\nanother, catching it, cried “Hurrah!”\r\n\r\nFor the French, German, and Russian fleets, in attempting to pass the\r\ntwo narrows north and south of Europe, had been stopped by the two\r\nsea-forts there; and though they had been so eager to pass, that they\r\nhad even offered to pay sea-rent, this, too, had been refused. They had\r\nthen, at five and at five-thirty in the afternoon, offered battle to\r\nthe islands: with the result that half their weight had been annihilated\r\nbefore they took to flight. So said the bulletin....\r\n\r\nAnd Hogarth in the midst of the jubilee saw the man who jammed his left\r\nshoulder, a broker in spectacles, grip the hand of the man on his right,\r\na ragamuffin, to cry out: “That scoundrel Hogarth! Isn't there good in\r\nthe damned thief, after all?”\r\n\r\nAnd the other: “Aye, he knows how to give it 'em 'ot, don't 'e, after\r\nall! Thank God for that!”\r\n\r\nThree weeks later peace was proclaimed by a procession at Temple Bar\r\nbetween England, Austro-Germany, France, Russia, and the Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE MANIFESTO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last effort of Europe to resist the Sea was made on the afternoon of\r\nthe 14th of October, when the British Prime Minister refused to conclude\r\na treaty of peace.\r\n\r\n“Your master is only a pirate--on a large scale”, he said to a Minister\r\nof the Sea.\r\n\r\nThat was on the 14th.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th there was a stoppage of British trade nearly all the world\r\nover.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th England was in a state of _émeute_ resembling revolution.\r\n\r\nOn the 28th the Treaty of Peace was signed.\r\n\r\nIts principal conditions were: (1) The undertaking by the Sea not to\r\nraise sea-rent on British ships without certain formalities of notice;\r\nand (2) The undertaking by Britain not to engage in the making of any\r\nrailway or overland trade-route, or of any marine engine of war, without\r\nthe consent of the Sea. And similar treaties were signed by the Sea with\r\nthe other nations.\r\n\r\nThen followed the rush of the Ambassadors to the _Boodah_, and the\r\nfrivolous round of Court-life revolved, _levée_, audience, dinner,\r\ndrawing-room, investiture; the Lord of the Sea descended from the throne\r\nbefore the Court to pin a cross upon the humble breast of his best shot\r\nand give him the title of Præceps, gave fanciful honours to emperors,\r\nreceived them of them--wore when throned a brow-band of gold with only\r\none stone, the biggest of the meteor octahedrons, that glanced about his\r\nbrow like an icicle in whose glass gallivanted a fairy clad in rags of\r\nthe rainbow.\r\n\r\nNow the old gaieties recommenced, but more Olympian in tone, as befitted\r\nthe ruler of rulers, terrible now being the lifting of Hogarth's brows\r\nat the least lapse in ritual; and only the chastest-nurtured of the\r\nearth ever now stalked through gavotte or pavane in those halls of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe world now lay at his feet. The dependence upon him of England, of\r\nFrance, of that part of Austro-Germany called Germany, was obvious: he\r\ncould starve them. But over Austria proper, Russia, Italy, his sway was\r\nno less omnipotent: for the panic cheapness of scrip which followed the\r\ndestruction of the _Kaiser_ had, of course, been foreseen, and used by\r\nhim; Beech had bought up, easily ousting the Rothschilds from their old\r\nfinancial kingship: by tens of millions the process had gone on; and\r\nstill it continued increasingly, for the wealth of Hogarth now, as\r\ncompared with that of other rich men, was like a ship to a skiff. If he\r\nthrew upon the market, the bankruptcy of several nations might follow:\r\nit was doubtful if the United States could survive; certainly, Austria,\r\nRussia, South America must go under.\r\n\r\nNor was the East less his slave: Japan a mercantile nation, China and\r\nTurkey in his fiscal net. So, looking round the globe toward the middle\r\nof November, he could observe scarcely a nation which he could not, by\r\nscribbling a telegram, crush out of recognition.\r\n\r\nIt was precisely then that Richard Hogarth revealed himself.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of November appeared his Manifesto.\r\n\r\nThis Charter, which everlastingly must remain one of the Scriptures of\r\nour planet, simple as a baby's syllables, yet large like the arch of\r\nHeaven, has left its mark on the human soul.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 16th its twenty clauses occupied in _pica_ a page\r\nof every newspaper, and it was posted up big in the streets of cities.\r\n\r\nThe document ran:\r\n\r\nRichard, by the Will of God....I do hereby discern, declare, and lay\r\ndown: That:\r\n\r\n1. What is no good cannot be owned: only goods can be owned.\r\n\r\n2. “_Good_” is _well_, or pleasant; goods is _well_th (wealth) or\r\npleasures: thus, a coal-mine, being no pleasure, cannot be owned.\r\n\r\n3. Coal _becomes_ goods after being moved, or taken. Moving does not\r\nmake it good; its nature does not make it good: moving-_plus_-Nature\r\nmakes it good, ownable. At the pit-head, already, it is a pleasure,\r\nfewer pains being now needed to move it to a fireplace. Thus, Nature\r\napart from motion cannot be owned, being no good, as a cave is no good\r\nto a caveman outside it: rain is wetting him; if he takes it, moves in,\r\nit is good.\r\n\r\nAnimals and plants, by taking things from the planets presented to them,\r\nby moving things, raise Nature into wealth, and own things.\r\n\r\n4. For Jack to _own_, have a thing for Jack's _own_, Jack must by his\r\n_own_ force have subdued Nature, must have taken the thing by moving\r\nthe thing's atoms, or moving something relatively to the thing, or,\r\nnegatively, by not evading, but accepting, the thing in motion--a wind,\r\ntide, light-wave; else Jack must have taken something (by as much work)\r\nto purchase the thing from its (true) owner, or accepted it as a favour\r\nfrom Nature in motion, or from its (true) owner. To say “own” is to say\r\n“take”; to say “take” is to say “motion”, i.e., the doing of work: “work\r\ndone” being FD, i.e., Force used into Distance moved-over. I cannot own\r\nthe air: it is no good; I own the air in my lungs, having taken, moved,\r\nit, done FD on it: it is very good; and I own the air which, doing FD,\r\nmoving to my face, I do not evade, but accept, take: it is very good.\r\n\r\nI say to Jack “take a cigar”; he loudly says “yes!”, but does not move\r\nit to his mouth, nor moves his mouth to it; instead, he moves a pen to\r\nhis mouth; this makes me laugh: he has not taken a cigar.\r\n\r\nJack is catching fish in a boat; Tom owns the boat: so Jack gives fish\r\nto Tom, until Jack's FD done on the fish is equivalent to Tom's FD done\r\non the boat; and now Jack owns the boat. If “the law” says that Tom\r\nstill owns the boat, this makes me laugh: for how can Tom come to own\r\ntwo boats' good by the FD done on one only?\r\n\r\nJack is ploughing the sea with a ship: just there he owns the sea, has\r\ntaken, is moving, it for his good. He does not own the sea before, nor\r\nthe sea behind, him: for the motions behind made by him have ceased to\r\ndo good.\r\n\r\nJack is ploughing soil: he owns the soil ploughed, has taken it, and\r\nwill own it while the motions he has made do good: so that, if Tom who\r\nhas not moved it says “I own the soil, for 'the law' declares that I\r\nhave taken it by moving a pen two inches”, this makes me laugh. Or, if\r\nJack says “I own it for ever”, this makes me laugh. Or, if anyone says\r\n“I own both the soil and the site” (relative position), this makes me\r\nlaugh: for what can one man move to make a relative position good? He\r\ncan neither move a field toward anything nor move much toward a field.\r\nIf many men move railways that way, or move things to rear towns round\r\nthe field, this makes the site good, moving it from outside a community\r\nto inside a community; and the many who make it good own it.\r\n\r\n5. The site is the field's chief good: so the plougher owes something to\r\nthose who, making it good, own it, This something is named “rent”.\r\n\r\n6. Suppose that the plougher, or dweller-on, is an Englishman: he owes\r\nrent to the English. And, since the site of England is made good by\r\nmovements made in America, he owes rent to the Americans.\r\n\r\n7. This the mind readily descries to be true: it is a “truism”, and\r\nis necessarily the Fundamental Principle of Society throughout the\r\nuniverse. So that, summing up, we may define: “Rent” is “right”, based\r\non truth when paid to those by whose movements a site is made good.\r\n\r\n8. One might readily guess (if there were no example of it) that any\r\nviolation of a Principle so fundamental would be avenged by Nature upon\r\nthe planet which violated it.\r\n\r\n9. Our planet is such an example: for here Two Separate Violations of\r\nthe Principle appear; each great in itself; but one small in comparison.\r\n\r\n10. Accordingly, for the small violation Nature has not failed to send\r\nupon Man a small penalty; and for the great violation great penalties.\r\n\r\n11. The small violation consists in the claim by nations to have taken,\r\nwithout having moved, sites called “countries”.\r\n\r\n12. For this Nature has sent upon man the small penalty of War.\r\n\r\n13. To abolish War men must remove its cause.\r\n\r\nTherefore let the site-rental of England (i.e., the excess of English\r\ngoods over what English goods would be, if no other country existed) be\r\nhanded over to a World Council; and the site-rental of America to the\r\nsame; and the World Council shall disburse such funds for the majesty\r\nand joy of Man: and War shall terminate.\r\n\r\n14. This way the Lord of the Sea indicates to the world, though with its\r\ninitiation he is not personally concerned.\r\n\r\n15. Beside the small violation of the Fundamental Principle of Society,\r\nthere is a great on the earth.\r\n\r\n16. The Great Violation consists in the claim by individuals to\r\nhave taken, without having moved, sites and soils called “estates”,\r\n“domains”, “plots”: for, as rent tends to rightness when paid to the\r\nfifty millions of a nation, _fifty-millionfold_ is its wrongness when\r\npaid to one; and as rent is right when paid to the thousand million\r\ninhabitants of a planet, _a thousand-millionfold_ is its wrongness when\r\npaid to one.\r\n\r\n17. For this Great Violation of the Fundamental Principle of Society\r\nNature has sent upon Man great penalties: poverties, frenzies,\r\ndepravities, horrors, sorrows, lowness, dulness.\r\n\r\n18. Lowness, dulness: for by far the greatest of these penalties is a\r\nrestraint on Man's development. Man is an animal, Man is a mind: and\r\nsince the wing of mind is Pride, Assurance, or Self-esteem, and since\r\nthe home of an animal is a Planet, and an animal without a home is a\r\nthing without Assurance or Pride, so Man without Earth is a mind without\r\nwing. Even so, a few, having Assurance, make what we call “Progress”,\r\ni.e., the discovering of truth--a crawling which might become flight,\r\nhad all minds but the wing of Pride to co-operate in discovering truth.\r\nBut Man lacks assurance and foothold, founded home and domain: his sole\r\nheritage, though he is neither fish nor fowl, being sea and air.\r\n\r\n19. This is a great violation.\r\n\r\n20. And with this great violation of the Fundamental Principle of\r\nSociety the Lord of the Sea is personally concerned. In the name of\r\nHeaven and of Earth he urges upon the nations of men to amend it in\r\nthe month of the promulgation of this Manifesto: and this summons he\r\nstrengthens with a threat of his resentment.\r\n\r\nAs the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, I will see to it.\r\n\r\nRICHARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX\r\n\r\nTHE “BOODAH'S” LOCK-UP\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after the Manifesto the marriage of Miss Stickney of New\r\nYork with Lord Alfred Cowern was to take place, this having been put\r\noff owing to the _Kaiser_ tragedy; and so, on the day of the Manifesto,\r\nBaruch Frankl, the Jew, was crossing to a wedding which, even in\r\nthe midst of great events, had stirred up a considerable rumour and\r\nsensation, since the American guests were to consist of the _coterie_\r\nknown as the “Thirty-four”, all millionaires, while “the cake” was to\r\nweigh three-quarters of a ton, each guest's grub to cost $500, and for\r\nthat breakfast the Neva had been ravished for fish and Siamese crags for\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nFrankl, however, was never destined to taste those five hundred dollar\r\nmouthfuls. It happened in this way: as the _Boodah's_ searchlights,\r\ndestroyed in the battle, were not yet repaired, in the interval\r\nsome lawless ships took the chance on dark nights to skulk past with\r\nextinguished lights; now, the captain of Frankl's chartered steamer\r\nhad that bright idea (being of adventurous turn), when night fell forty\r\nknots east of the _Boodah_, so he came to Frankl, and broached the\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\n“Not for Joe”, was Frankl's answer: “pay the Pirate his taxes and be\r\ndone”.\r\n\r\n“It could be worked as sweet as a nut, sir!” persisted the skipper, with\r\na watering mind.\r\n\r\n“Well, so long us _you_ take the risk, perhaps--but no, sir, I'd rather\r\nnot”.\r\n\r\nOn which the skipper winked self-willed to himself, and, putting out\r\nnine miles from the _Boodah_ his three lights, went dashing past.\r\n\r\nAnd the attempt would have succeeded, had it not been for the fact that\r\nthe night was pitch-dark, and that _another_ ship was trying that very\r\nventure with extinguished lights. And these two ships met, bow to bow,\r\nwith such an energy of adventurous smartness, that both sharply sank.\r\n\r\nThe sea, however, being smooth, all hands were saved; and now, since the\r\nboats lay forlorn on the vast, with nothing but the _Boodah's_ swarm\r\nof moons to move to, for the _Boodah_ they started, while Frankl cast\r\ntwinkling fingers to the sky, and cursed that night, as the oars with\r\nslow wash journeyed through turgid murk toward the very den of the\r\ndevil.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the _Boodah_ they were conducted down to a\r\npolice-court, and there shivered an hour in a dreary light, till three\r\nofficials in peaked caps and frock-coats came, sat on a Bench, and,\r\nafter hearing evidence, pronounced sentence of seven months against the\r\ncaptains, and one against Frankl.\r\n\r\nThese were led away by police blue-jackets, and Frankl groaned through\r\nthe night in a box as cold as the cells of Colmoor.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Quilter-Beckett, making a report in Hogarth's _salon_,\r\nmentioned the incident, saying: “Here are the names, with the sentences;\r\nI shall send the sailors home...” and Hogarth's eyes, resting on the\r\ndocument, chanced to catch that name of Frankl.\r\n\r\nAt once he turned pale, for his first thought was: “Frankl must have\r\nbeen going to the wedding, in which case _Someone Else_ may be with\r\nhim”.\r\n\r\nBut her name was not there....\r\n\r\nHe rose and paced; and he said low: “No one else on either of the\r\nships?”\r\n\r\n“No, my Lord King”.\r\n\r\nThen up lifted Hogarth's brow, alight with fun, and he muttered: “All\r\nright, Caps-and-tassels”.\r\n\r\nHe said aloud: “Quilter-Beckett, this Frankl I know. Did you never hear\r\nanything about Caps-and-tassels at Westring? _He_ is Caps-and-tassels.\r\nNow tell me, which is your biggest blue-jacket?”\r\n\r\n“Man called Young, my Lord King”.\r\n\r\n“Then, have a suit of Young's sea-clothes put upon this Frankl, and\r\nlet him be brought before me in the Throne Room this morning after the\r\nAudience. He was fond of liveries....”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, by half-past eleven Frankl entered the Throne Room, where,\r\nas soon as its rosy translucency broke upon his gaze, an “Oh!” of\r\nadmiration groaned from him, in spite of his weight of misery, he\r\nnot walking, but being lifted forward in successive swings by his\r\narmpits--up the first steps to the outer circle of balustrade, forward\r\nto the second steps and the inner balustrade, within which shone the\r\nthrone, and Hogarth, crowned and large in robes, on it.\r\n\r\nThe two warders, intent upon portering Frankl, and not noticing the cap\r\nwhich still covered his eyebrows, one now in sudden scare whispered:\r\n“Off with your cap, you...!” on which Frankl snatched it off, grasping\r\nthrough superabundant sleeves, he at the same moment a fury and a\r\ndazzled man, the throne before him incredible, like a dream which one\r\nknows to be a dream, in structure not unlike the Peacock Throne of\r\nAkbar, its length fourteen feet, seating thirteen persons in recesses,\r\nstanding on a gold platform with three concave steps set with rings\r\nof sapphire, and consisting of a central part and two wings, the wings\r\nbeing supported on twisted legs (one had been broken), and made of\r\nfretted ivory mosaicked with cabochon emerald, ruby, topaz, turquoise,\r\nchrysoberyl, diamond, opal, the large central part, with its recesses,\r\nbeing also of ivory, gold-arabesqued, its mosque-shape canopy (of\r\nHindoo enamel-work on the outside) being supported by eleven pillars of\r\nemerald; at the top of each pillar a dolphin (hence the name “Dolphin\r\nThrone”) made of turquoise, jasper, pearl, sardius, and at the bottom of\r\neach pillar a _guldusta_, or bouquet, of gems; the concave ceiling one\r\nmass of stones, representing a sea in which sailed three Dutch galleons,\r\nand seven dolphins sported.\r\n\r\nBut all that Frankl saw of it was its opulence: for his terror lest the\r\nwarders should let him go occupied his mind.\r\n\r\nAnd precisely the thing which he feared came upon him, for Hogarth said:\r\n“Warders, retire”.\r\n\r\nAnd now Frankl, all unsupported, stood in unstable equilibrium, anon\r\nstooping to his finger-tips, then straining doubtfully forward with\r\nstruggling arms from a too backward poise: for not only did the trousers\r\nlie a twisted emptiness far below his feet, but the feet themselves\r\nwere lost in Young's boots, so he stood like Scaramouch, a mere sack,\r\na working of his chin wobbling down his beard, and there was a blaze in\r\nhis stare which Hogarth, unfortunately, did not well estimate.\r\n\r\nThey faced each other, alone, save for the body-guard at the\r\ncircumference of the room.\r\n\r\n“Was it _you_ that sent me to Colmoor?” Hogarth suddenly asked in a low\r\nvoice, stooping forward.\r\n\r\n“_Me_!” shrieked Baruch Frankl, pointing a hanging sleeve-end to his\r\nbreast: “as Jehovah is my witness--”\r\n\r\n“Were you about to _swear_? For ever the same?--tyrant and worm? It\r\n_was_ you. Now tell it me right out: you have nothing to fear: for you\r\ncannot be vain enough to imagine that I would harbour enmity against\r\nyou”.\r\n\r\n“It wasn't me, I say again, my Lord King!”--Frankl trampled a little\r\nbackward, then stooped over-poised to his finger-tips: “with what\r\nmotive? Oh, that's hard--to be accused. They have already given me\r\na month--my God! a month! And only because I am a Jew. But it wasn't\r\nme--that I'll swear to God--”\r\n\r\nHogarth rose to his height, descended, put his hand upon Frankl's\r\nshoulder. “Well, leave that. But--_my sister_!”\r\n\r\nHis hand felt the shoulder beneath it start like fits.\r\n\r\n“Your sister!” Frankl screamed with a face of scare: “Why, what of her\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“Frankl, you are frightened: you know, Frankl, _where she is_!”\r\n\r\n“Me? O, my Good God, what is this! Me, poor sinner, know where your\r\nsister is, my Lord King? Why, spare me! spare me, God of Hosts! Why,\r\nyou've only got to ask yourself the question--”\r\n\r\n“Listen to me, Frankl”, said Hogarth, bending his blazing brow low over\r\nthe Jew: “I have searched for that woman through the world, and have not\r\nfound her. All the time, mind you, I felt convinced that you know where\r\nshe is; and you may wonder why--years ago--I did not have you seized.\r\nI will tell you why: it was because I had a sort of instinct that God,\r\nwhom I serve continually with tears and prayers, would not fail in\r\nHis day to show me her face: and to-day you are here. Do you suppose,\r\nFrankl, that you will go away without telling me where she is? And in\r\norder to hurry you, listen to what I say to your warders--”\r\n\r\nHe touched a button in the balustrade, and to the warders said: “If at\r\nany time this man should demand pencil and paper, supply them, and take\r\nto your Admiral what he writes. To-day his food shall be fare from your\r\nown table; to-morrow three loaves and water; from the third day one loaf\r\nand water; till further orders”.\r\n\r\nUp shot Frankl's shivering arms, while Hogarth, training his ermines and\r\npurples, paced away.\r\n\r\nThat was on the day following the Manifesto.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time Frankl's three loaves had become one, that amazement with\r\nwhich men received the Manifesto had commenced to give place to more\r\ncoherent impressions.\r\n\r\nHe was not a “Monster”! that was the first realization--no pirate, nor\r\nlurid Anti-Christ, nor vainglorious Caesar! And in two days, the first\r\nastonishment over, there arose a noise in the world: for the Lord of the\r\nSea had given to the nations one month only in which to do that thing:\r\nand the peoples took passionately to meetings.\r\n\r\nIn England Land Leagues, Chambers of Agriculture, Restoration Leagues,\r\nNationalization Leagues, many Leagues, were organizing furiously,\r\nstretching the right arm of oratory; deputations, petitions in wagons,\r\ndemonstrations _en bloc_, party cannonades, racket heaven-high.\r\nSir Moses Cohen, the Jew-Liberal Leader, appealing to the strongest\r\nprejudice in Englishmen, spoke one night at Newcastle of “the\r\ninterference of a foreign prince in the affairs of Britain”; used the\r\nword: “_Never!_”, and on this cry secured an enormous following: so\r\nthat, within a week, he was instrumental in forming the formidable\r\nLeague of Resistance--destined to prove so tragic for Hogarth, and for\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of this world-turmoil that--on the third day--the\r\nmarriage-morning of Miss Cecil Stickney dawned; and that same evening\r\nRebekah Frankl, convalescent from influenza, was seated over a bedroom\r\nfire in Hanover Square, a cashmire round her shoulders, her sickness\r\ncured by herbs, her physician then hobbling with a stick down the\r\nstairs--Estrella of Lisbon--her back almost horizontal now with age.\r\n\r\nAnd as Rebekah mused there, two newsboys below, whose shouts pursued\r\neach other, went proclaiming through November gloom as it were the day\r\nof doom, crying, even in that uproar of Europe, a private event:\r\n\r\nMARRIAGE OF\r\n\r\nLORD ALFRED COWERN\r\n\r\nAND MISS CECIL STICKNEY\r\n\r\nAPPALLING TRAGEDY\r\n\r\nAnd soon a girl ran in, gasping: “Miss Frankl!--this is too awful--your\r\nfather--”\r\n\r\nThe news, having been flashed to Paris by Mackay-Bennett cable, now\r\nappeared in detail after the _New York Herald's_ French edition, and\r\nRebekah's eyes ran wildly over details as to the “bevy of beauty”,\r\ndaughters of “the Thirty-four”, and the church of waiting ladies, the\r\ncarpeted path between palms and exotics, and how the ticket-holders\r\nheard the organ tell the Cantilenet Nuptiale and Bennett's Minuet; and\r\nthen the multitudinous stir: behold the bridegroom cometh!--the little\r\nnecessary bridegroom of no importance, and then the white entry of bride\r\nand bridal train, while the choir knelt to sing “O Perfect Love”.\r\n\r\nPerfect love, however, was hardly the order of that day, but rather\r\nperfect hate: for in Madison Square--the church being at the upper end\r\nof Fifth Avenue--a mob was being harangued on the subject of this very\r\nwedding: and when they heard and realized the thing that was being done\r\nbefore their eyes they were swept as by a wind of fire, and under its\r\nimpulse set out like some swollen Rhone with a rushing sound to pounce\r\nupon the church, full of perfect hate: and the choir sang “O perfect\r\nlove”.\r\n\r\nWhat happened now was described as a nightmare. The same elemental\r\ninstincts of the Stone Age which had exhibited themselves in the\r\n$500-worth of food wrought in another form, but with no less savagery,\r\nin assassins as in victims: and a massacre ensued, bride and bridegroom\r\npassing away like bubbles, of “the Thirty-four” five only escaping. The\r\nreport ended with the words: “The ringleaders have been arrested; quiet\r\nreigns through the city”; then a list of the guests, with asterisks\r\nindicating those killed.\r\n\r\nRebekah searched for her father's name, and when she became certain that\r\nit was not there, her lips moved in thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nBut since Frankl was not at the wedding, where, then, was Frankl? She\r\ncounted the days on her fingers: he could not have been late.\r\n\r\nUnless there had been an accident to his ship....\r\n\r\nHer brows knit a little; she peered into the fire: and thought of the\r\n_Boodah_....\r\n\r\nIt was possible that when her father's steamer stopped to pay sea-rent,\r\nHogarth might have heard, and seized him. That notion occurred to her.\r\n\r\nAnd at once it threw her into an extraordinary fever, her bosom swelling\r\nlike elastic in her heavings to catch breath, though she did not realize\r\nthe wild thought that was working up to birth within her. She rose and\r\npaced, furiously fast.\r\n\r\nIf he was in the hands of Hogarth?\r\n\r\n“He is a British subject”, she muttered: “Hogarth has not the\r\nright...Oh, he has not the right...!”\r\n\r\nShe was fearfully agitated! something fighting up and up within her,\r\nstifling her, working to burst into birth; she flung the cashmire\r\nfrom her shoulders, her bosom rowing like two oarsmen. “Because we are\r\nJews...!” she went.\r\n\r\n“If he _dared_ do that--!”\r\n\r\nWhat then? Say! Rebekah!\r\n\r\n“I would go to him myself--”\r\n\r\nAll at once that thought was born, and she stood shockingly naked to\r\nher own eyes, her hands rushing to cover a face washed in shame. “But,\r\nsurely”, she whispered, “I could never be so _bold_, good Heavens? Why,\r\nNever! Never--!”\r\n\r\nHowever, an hour later, with flaming eyes, she was writing a letter to\r\nFrankl's manager.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI\r\n\r\nTHE VISIT\r\n\r\n\r\nFrankl's Bank was scanning the agents' yacht-lists for her, when Sir\r\nMoses Cohen, who was closely associated with Frankl, placed his own\r\nthree-master at her disposal; and she set out from Bristol, with her\r\nbeing three Jewish ladies, Frankl's manager, and a snuffy Portuguese\r\nrabbi who resembled a Rembrandt portrait.\r\n\r\nIt was late at night, and Hogarth, who had lately acquired a passion for\r\nthose Mathematics which touch upon Mysticism, was bent over Quaternions\r\nand the quirks of [Proofers note: checkmark symbol] (--i) in an alcove\r\nof his _Boodah_ suite hardly fourteen feet square, cosy, rosy, and\r\nhomely: he sitting at a sofa-head, and, lying on the sofa, Loveday, his\r\nhead on Hogarth's thigh, escaped from office and frockcoat, in happy\r\nshirt-sleeves, between sleeping and waking.\r\n\r\nHogarth was interrupted by a telephone bell.\r\n\r\n“Well?” he answered.\r\n\r\n“My Lord King”, from Quilter-Beckett, “Frankl has handed to his warder\r\nsomething written: will your Lordship's Majesty see it now?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” Then: “John! Frankl has yielded!”\r\n\r\nUp Loveday started with “Thank God!” while Hogarth: “When does my yacht\r\narrive?”\r\n\r\n“At midnight”--from Quilter-Beckett.\r\n\r\n“She starts back immediately for England with me and Mr. Loveday”.\r\n\r\nNow an officer entered to present an envelope, and the two looked\r\ntogether over these words:\r\n\r\n“Your Lordship's Majesty's sister, Margaret Hogarth, is at No. 11,\r\nMarket Street, Edgware Road, London. She goes under the name of Rachel\r\nOppenheimer, I don't know why. As God is my witness, I repent in ashes.\r\nWon't your Lordship's Majesty have mercy on a worm of the earth? I am\r\nan old man, getting on, and starved to madness. The ever devoted slave,\r\nfrom this day forth, of my Lord King.\r\n\r\n“BARUGH FRANKL”.\r\n\r\nHogarth 'phoned up: “Give Frankl food now, and put him where it is not\r\ncold....” and to Loveday he said, “Well, you see, she is there: 'No. 11,\r\nMarket Street'. And under the name of--what? 'Rachel Oppenheimer'...John\r\nLoveday, do you fathom the meaning of that?”\r\n\r\n“No--don't bother me about meanings, but shout, like her, 'O Happy Day!'\r\nI say, Richard, you remember that singing? how we would hear her from\r\nthe forge? All day, washing, cooking--melodious soul! There was 'O Happy\r\nDay', and there was--By God, how charmingly holy! how English! And,\r\nRichard, you remember--?”\r\n\r\nAnother telephone bell: Hogarth turned to hear.\r\n\r\n“Just arrived in the yacht, _Tyre_, my Lord King”, said\r\nQuilter-Beckett's voice, “four Jewish ladies, a Jewish gentleman, and a\r\nrabbi, who request early audience to-morrow; they lie-to, and have sent\r\na boat--”\r\n\r\n“Rubbish! I shall not be here to-morrow, and even if I was--Who are\r\nthey? By the way, no sign of the yacht?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet. They are Miss Frankl--”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“Miss Rebekah Frankl--”\r\n\r\n“God”, went Hogarth faintly, stabbed to the heart.\r\n\r\n“Miss Agnes Friedrich, Mrs.--”\r\n\r\nBut the rest fell upon ears deaf as death, the teeth of Hogarth now\r\nchattering as with cold, that haggard, gaunt yellow, which was his\r\npallor, overspreading his face. So long was he speechless, that\r\nQuilter-Beckett asked: “Are you there, my Lord King?”\r\n\r\n“Quilter-Beckett!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my Lord King?”\r\n\r\n“Will you go _yourself_--for me--to them? _Make_ them sleep here, will\r\nyou? This is most urgent, I assure you. And go quick, will you?”\r\n\r\nThat night did not the Lord of the Sea sleep: she under his roof...\r\n\r\nNor did he go that night to find Margaret--nor the next day, nor the\r\nnext, though Loveday chafed: for, gyrating through the giddy air of a\r\ngalaxy where Margaret was not, he forgot her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII\r\n\r\nREBEKAH TELLS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time Hogarth, personally, was in close relation with the score\r\nof Embassies that inhabited the belly of the _Boodah_, these intriguing\r\nincessantly for half-hours at his ear, and in communication, meanwhile,\r\nwith their Governments through O'Hara's _Mahomet_: so that Hogarth had\r\nto get up early, and his mornings sweated with audience and negotiation.\r\n\r\nThe German and Russian Emperors, with the Prince of Wales (then\r\nvirtually Regent), had hurriedly met at Vienna--presumably for the\r\ndiscussion of the Manifesto; and immediately after it, the Prince, who\r\nhad the reputation of being one of the most tactful of men-of-the-world,\r\ntook a step which hinted that the Royal House, as often before, meant to\r\ncome to the rescue of the country which loved it however the politicians\r\nmight bungle: Hogarth was invited to accept the Garter.\r\n\r\nHe accepted: and the ceremony in the _Boodah_ was witnessed, as it were,\r\nby Europe, King-at-Arms in a new tabard, with his suite, going to invest\r\nhim, taking the Statute of the Chapter, with the Great Seal of England,\r\nand a set of habiliments--white-silk stockings, gold sword Spanish hat,\r\nstars, gloves. And the effect was speedy, the other rulers, dumbfounded\r\nbefore, said now: “England will comply with the Manifesto; and, if\r\nbefore us, the taxed sea opens to her....Yield, moreover, we must: let\r\nus make haste!”\r\n\r\nBut to consent was one thing: the _how_ another: the mere suspicion of\r\nthe willingness of Kaiser or Tsar shook their thrones. Whereupon Russia\r\nsaid to Hogarth: “Recently dispossessed, they cling dyingly now to their\r\nlands, so I will _buy_ the land from them, and _you_ will lend me the\r\nmoney”; to which Hogarth virtually replied: “It is too childish to talk\r\nof buying part of a heavenly body from a Russian: have you no sense of\r\nhumour? You may give the Russian 'nobles' some money, if that pleases\r\nyou: but without my help. If His Majesty the Tsar is more afraid of them\r\nthan of me, my only way will be to prove myself more truly terrible than\r\nthey”.\r\n\r\nBut high words hurl down no hundred-headed hydra: in France--fast,\r\nfaster--with dizzy vertigo--millions were forming themselves into secret\r\nsocieties, while in England was One only--but stronger than the many of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nBy the date of Rebekah's pilgrimage Hogarth had so far failed and\r\nyielded, as almost to decide that from the _Boodah_ nothing could be\r\ndone, unless he went to the extent of ruining and starving. The other\r\nalternative was the fixing upon one nation, becoming its recognized\r\nruler, and there furnishing an example both of _modus operandi_, and\r\nof a subsequent state of happiness, which others could not long refrain\r\nfrom imitating.\r\n\r\nBut this modification was still in the air; and, meanwhile, he listened,\r\nweighed, revolved: using men, impressing, convincing, extracting for his\r\nuse the wisdom of their experience, estimating the exact pressure of the\r\nTime, the _timbre_ of its roar.\r\n\r\nSo on the morning after Rebekah's arrival his Gold Stick became his\r\nrack from the moment of the bow from the throne till noon: name after\r\nname--cordons, orders, gold-lace, sashes, stars, tiaras; till enter the\r\nfour Jewesses, the bank-manager, the rabbi, Hogarth's pallor showing\r\nup his three moles and nose-freckles, adding a glare to his eyes, he\r\nsuffering from the runaway drumming of his heart.\r\n\r\nThe ladies stoop through curtseys; the men do reverence; Hogarth bows.\r\n\r\nThere like a Begum of Bhopal stood Rebekah, floridly reflected in the\r\nglassy floor, sallow under the eyes, smiling at him, he at her; and very\r\nquickly now, she once in his sight, he recovered comparative calm, and\r\nthe strength of his heart.\r\n\r\n“Your first visit to the _Boodah_, I think?”--looking at her.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my Lord King”--curtseying.\r\n\r\n“Do you like her?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes: she is solid, and mighty, and rich. In my own, and the\r\nname of my friends, I beg to thank your Lordship's Majesty for your\r\nLordship's Majesty's kind and good hospitality to us”.\r\n\r\n“Humbugging little beggar”, thought Hogarth, his mind slowly gathering\r\ntone, but rushing meanwhile into a species of frivolous assurance after\r\nthose agitations, his hands still cold.\r\n\r\n“Well”, he said, “but you have not seen her! I think I know her fairly\r\nwell, and I propose to be myself your guide, if that will interest\r\nyou--”\r\n\r\nThe Rabbi spoke with trembling voice: “It is gracious, my Lord King.\r\nWe are here, however, humbly to present an urgent petition to your\r\nLordship's Majesty. Baruch Frankl, at present a prisoner in the\r\n_Boodah_, a man no longer young, and habituated to comfort--”\r\n\r\n“Stay”, interrupted Hogarth: “if you have a petition the day and hour\r\nmust be arranged by negotiation between yourself and my Chamberlain. But\r\nsurely, meantime, I may consider you my guest? Miss Frankl and I--have\r\nmet--in the world. Come, ladies--come, sirs--say yes!”\r\n\r\nRebekah, standing averted, flashed a look at him, reading his heart, and\r\nJews and Jewesses laid heads together, whispering a little, until the\r\nRabbi said, bowing: “We bend to your Lordship's Majesty's most gracious\r\nwill”.\r\n\r\n“Agreed, then, sir. We might now see the _Boodah_, and if you will\r\nluncheon with me--Mr. Chamberlain! direct Admiral Quilter-Beckett to\r\nmeet me at once in the north corridor”.\r\n\r\nHe rose, master of his limbs now, descended, unrobed in an alcove, and\r\nin a corridor above the circular stair came upon Quilter-Beckett, who,\r\nacting as guide, Rebekah's hand now resting on Hogarth's arm, led them\r\nabout the _Boodah_, now walking, now slipping in little trains over\r\neighty-foot rails, rolled in one heat, laid down the vanishing length\r\nof dim-lit corridors floored with white tiles, their frieze of majolica,\r\nwith rows of ceramics; and they saw the armouries, piles of rifles,\r\ncutlasses, pistols; ferneries grown by electric light; great\r\ncold-storage rooms that struck a chill, for preserving meats, butter,\r\nfruit; the doctors' _environ_, the dispensary, and roomy hospital;\r\nwatched from a railing the working engines that fixed the _Boodah's_\r\nposition, Hogarth here saying: “There you have a menagerie of\r\ngnome-land: observe those two black beetles, sedately nodding; and there\r\nis daddy-longlegs, working his legs gymnastically; and the three pairs\r\nof gallant grey stallions, galloping grandly neck to neck; and those two\r\nridiculous beings, rubbing their palms together, round and round: each\r\npreoccupied, comically solemn, busied about its own quaint affairs--like\r\na varied gnomeland”.\r\n\r\nAnd Rebekah said in a meek tone, like the hen submitting: “Yes, I see\r\nnow you say it, my Lord King”.\r\n\r\nUp stairs and down, round semicircles, up lifts, through nooks,\r\ncorridors: saw the guns, and how by hydraulics everything was done--the\r\nhoisting of ammunition, loading, training: guns intact, guns wrecked by\r\nthe Dreadnoughts; and shimmering kitchens, which reeked a smell of heat,\r\nand the dairy-maids, and the line of kine, and the row of prison-doors,\r\nand the mechanism of ventilation, fans and blowers, the drainage-system,\r\nand the dynamos for lighting, for supplying power to motors, for\r\nheating, and for shimmering forth rich in the search-lights; and the\r\ncentral ballroom, the clothes store, the original one-ninety-sixth\r\nmodel, the Ambassador-region, the steaming laundry, and the roof, where\r\nRebekah saw her initials on the breeze, and the vertical pop-guns under\r\nshields for dealing with aeroplane attack, and the cream theatre, and\r\nthe paymaster's suite, and the bunkers, the Government-offices,\r\nand the tax-receiving rooms, the telephone system, and the\r\nlady-telegraphists--till all were tired, though half had not been\r\nseen. They luncheoned together; in the early afternoon there was an\r\nInvestiture, and she was there; for “five-o'clock” there was a Gounod\r\nconcert in the theatre, and she sat in his box; at night the Bulgarian\r\nAmbassador gave a ball, and she danced a gavotte with him.\r\n\r\nWhen they parted a dying wind sighed his name: “_Hogarth_...”; and when\r\nLoveday before sleeping happened to ask: “When do we set out for London,\r\nRichard?” Hogarth with a laugh turned upon him, replying: “When do we\r\nset out for Arcturus and the Pleiades? Do give one time to look round\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\nThe next morning Rebekah, led forward from a semicircle of courtiers by\r\na backing Silver Stick, approached within four feet of the Throne, and\r\nafter the protracted humiliation of her curtsey, said ruefully: “Our\r\nparty have failed, my Lord King, to obtain audience for our humble\r\npetition till after four days”.\r\n\r\n“Is that too long?”\r\n\r\n“We could not wait beyond to-night. Our good Rabbi, and my father's\r\nManager--both must hurry back, and we others with them. This being so,\r\n_I_ appeal to Your Lordship's Majesty “.\r\n\r\n“A _personal_ appeal?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”--poutingly.\r\n\r\n“Then, I grant an audience”.\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“Here”.\r\n\r\n“Who will be here?”\r\n\r\n“Why--you and I.”\r\n\r\n“_No_”--very low, with pressed lips.\r\n\r\n“I am so sorry”, says he: “it is the only chance I shall have; not for\r\nlong--a few minutes--I am so busy. Otherwise, you will have to stay four\r\ndays--and your poor father suffering--”\r\n\r\nShe seemed unsure now, and his hands in the uncertainty of that moment\r\nwere moist like melting ice.\r\n\r\n“So, then, you accept”, said he: “a little audience--you grant me? Or\r\nrather, I grant you”.\r\n\r\n“When, my Lord King?”\r\n\r\n“At three--No, what folly! At four. Will you? At four? And here? Say at\r\nfour”.\r\n\r\nHe spoke leaning keenly forward; and she, with a curtsey of\r\nacquiescence, retired.\r\n\r\nThey were near again, and yet far, in the _salle à manger_ at luncheon,\r\na function of a hundred guests at small tables, with more of orchestra\r\nthan of talk; and even as Hogarth and his train entered, and the crowd\r\nrose, she saw his eyes, by some power, prowl and find her.\r\n\r\nAfterwards there were two hours to wait.\r\n\r\nSuch a heat of haste now possessed them both! Hogarth locked himself\r\nfrom his attendants into his bed-chamber, and, tumbling a chaos of\r\nclothes and uniforms upon the carpet, stumbled bitterly among them,\r\nhunting for a cravat whose effect he remembered; wished at the mirror\r\nthat he had no moles and nose-freckles, or that his father had turned\r\nhim out rather less black; and anon a delicious chill pang of mingled\r\nsugar and peppermint would gash his heart at the thought: “_she\r\nconsented!_” He broke glass, dropped his watch to fragments, hissing\r\n“damn the thing!”; and about half-past three the hands of Rebekah,\r\ntoo, in _her_ locked closet, were like the scattering sirocco among\r\npowder-boxes brushes, jewel-cases, and toilet-toys. What a hot haste\r\nwas here! She too much blued her eyes, and bruised the skin in wiping,\r\nintense the contest between poudre blanche and poudre Rachel, violette\r\nand germandrée, she manoeuvring among mirrors to catch each angle of\r\nview, but with a blind impatience; and, if she wanted something, she\r\ntripped running, breathless: such a disease of flurry, an eruption\r\nand conflagration of haste--for nothing; yet, all the while, with a\r\nmiserable sub-feeling of the penal creeping of time.\r\n\r\nAt four Hogarth in the Throne-room alone was now afraid that he would\r\nnot be able to utter a syllable, and wished that she would not come;\r\nthen, in a minute, began to fear that she would not, and wondered\r\nwhether he was not a deluded fool ever to have dreamed it, he walking\r\nquick, or anon listening like a thief in that half-dark: for few lights\r\nwere shining, the hall like the after-flush of sunset just before the\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nAt four past four he was aware of a rustling train's rush down the\r\nsteps, and now was like a man with his neck on the block, awaiting the\r\naxe. A moment afterwards she was before him, and two moments afterwards\r\nhe was collected and hot, and a man again.\r\n\r\n“_Dear_”, he whispered at her ear, leading her by the hand to an ottoman\r\nin a near alcove.\r\n\r\nShe, in self-defence, was repellent, breathlessly saying with galloping\r\nhaste: “No--I will not sit: you sit, and I will stand here: do as I say,\r\nHogarth--or I repent and go: I know you, and you know me--or you should.\r\nOur talk must be short. You say _dear_ to me: that is very gentle, my\r\nfriend; but it was not to bandy such words that I am here--alone--with\r\nyou and your strength--Hogarth. I come as a suppliant, to implore\r\nyou--firstly for the man who is my father--and secondly for yourself, to\r\nwarn you. You are said to be about to become the sovereign of England--”\r\n\r\n“_I_ am?”--starting where he sat obediently before her, surprised\r\nthat she should utter the purpose then forming in his mind: “witch--of\r\nEndor!”\r\n\r\n“_I_ am not the witch, but an old lady in whose predictions many Jews\r\nbelieve, who prophesies the return of the Jews to Palestine--through\r\nyou. Be that as it may, if it is so that you are about to meddle\r\nwith the institutions of England, oh beware, the resistence will be\r\nterrible!”\r\n\r\n“With respect to England I am omnipotent”.\r\n\r\n“Yes, you can starve it, but _will_ you? You won't. And listen to your\r\nfriend: there is now in London a society, enormously powerful I believe,\r\nsworn to your destruction”.\r\n\r\n“What can they do--assassinate me?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! who knows?”\r\n\r\n“That would be too childish: I have sown my seed in Time, and it will\r\ngrow: two thousand little lords could hardly obliterate the ploughing of\r\nmy wrist. But you know this?”\r\n\r\n“Richard, my father is of them”.\r\n\r\n“Ha!--I forgive him: his daughter seems to be on the other side--”\r\n\r\n“Richard, you would not touch my hand? Ah, my friend, I warn you--!\r\nNow--you have agitated--I have been ill--my father is of them. And who\r\nis one of the closest associates of my father--?”\r\n\r\n“Who?”\r\n\r\n“The person known as Admiral Donald, whom _I_ know very well to be\r\nMonsignor O'Hara. I think you might have been more--recondite--in your\r\nchoice of an admiral, Richard!”\r\n\r\n“Ah?--you surprise me”.\r\n\r\n“But why? You once sent that man to me as a notebearer: certainly, a\r\nsingular selection. You must have known that he had been a convict--”\r\n\r\n“I thought him innocent then!”\r\n\r\n“But you know now--?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”.\r\n\r\n“And is it not extraordinary that your ensign bears my initials, while\r\nthis man is one of your commanders?”\r\n\r\n“I confess that I do not see the point--”\r\n\r\n“Then you cannot know, I suppose, that it was against _me_ that his\r\noffence was directed”.\r\n\r\nHogarth's left lid lowered....\r\n\r\n“But my complaint is of the present: are you not aware of the scandal\r\nwhich the _Mahomet_ is now creating in the world?”\r\n\r\n“Scandal?”\r\n\r\n“Thrice lately whispers have reached me of unnameable iniquities\r\nperpetrated there--Alexandria of the sixth century, Rome of the second!\r\nI believe the rumour is widely spread in London--no woman of the world\r\nnow lands on the _Mahomet_”.\r\n\r\n“It was _you_ whom he assaulted...” Hogarth laughed and was pale at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Yes, but observe that I must go now, my friend. I have spoken of the\r\nthings which I had in my mind: there remains--my father”.\r\n\r\n“He shall go with you”.\r\n\r\n“I thank you, my Lord King; that must be in an hour: so I say, Richard,\r\ngood-bye”.\r\n\r\n“I do not suppose you can dream how dark--” he went woefully.\r\n\r\nOf which she took no notice, but with rapid speech said: “How fair\r\nthis hall is--one supposes that the art of impressions was lost with\r\nSolomon--like some chamber under a lake at set of sun, colour without\r\nsubstance, suspended, flushed--I cannot express--”\r\n\r\n“Sad, say”.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Richard”.\r\n\r\n“Rebekah!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Richard, my poor friend?”\r\n\r\n“Have pity!”\r\n\r\n“Poor Richard!”\r\n\r\n“I can't help it, you are all mixed up with my blood, don't go from me.\r\nIf you think it a sin--the Gentile--God will forgive the charity. Come\r\nfor ever--”\r\n\r\nNow he sobbed once, and, as he sobbed, she was on her knees, in pagan\r\nposture, at his knees. “Do not--” distractedly--“see, I kiss your\r\nhand-do you doubt that I pity my love--as a mother has compassion--?”\r\n\r\nNow were heaving breasts, a vehement fight for breaths, wild eyes, and a\r\nlive brand in the marrow.\r\n\r\n“You will not go! I have you! In God's name, what a mad thing--!”\r\n\r\n“My furious king--you kiss--” the short-winded _mélée_ of whispers now\r\nsuffocated in a passion of inarticulate breaths; but at that moment one\r\nof Rebekah's chaperons, wandering out of time and place, stood at the\r\nalcove entrance, and they, smitten into two, sprang straight, awaked\r\nfrom trance, Rebekah with half a sob and half a laugh.\r\n\r\nAnd two hours later Hogarth, from the roof, saw the Jewish yacht\r\ndisappear to the East, on board being the four--and Frankl.\r\n\r\nAs he descended, he threw up his head with: “Ha!--O'Hara”; announced his\r\nimmediate departure with only a secretary and two lords-in-waiting, left\r\na mystical note for Loveday, saying that he had decided to go alone in\r\nquest of Margaret, and went almost secretly, only the salute informing\r\nthe _Boodah_ as he steamed away. In reality he was in haste to face\r\nO'Hara, and the yacht's bows turned, not eastward, but southward, under\r\nforced draught, to arrive at the _Mahomet_ in early afternoon. As her\r\nflags indicated the Lord of the Sea absent, there was no salute, and,\r\nlanding in a panama and jacket, in the Collector's Office he gave the\r\nsign of mum, and, led only by a blue-jacket, went spying the depths of\r\nthe _Mahomet_.\r\n\r\nIn many parts, noticing a singular odour, “What is it I smell?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Incense, my Lord King”, the man answered.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth floor he entered the loveliest _bijou_ chapel, the\r\ncoenaculum gold-plated, altar flower-piled, frescoed roof, “stations”\r\n in oils, where a lonesome Moorish youth slothfully swung and swung a\r\nthurible ruby-studded: but in vestments of no _enfant de choeur_--of an\r\nancient Phrygian.\r\n\r\nAnother descent and Hogarth reached a region of laugh and harping:\r\nwhereupon, dismissing his guide, he tracked the music into a nook so\r\nrare, that he stood amazed--a Court of Love, or Mahommedan Heaven, or\r\ngrot of Omar--anything old, lovely, and devil-sacred--the air chokingly\r\nodorous, near a fountain some brazen demon--Moloch or Baal--buried in\r\nroses, over everything roses, bounty of flowers, a very harvest-home of\r\nChloris, Flora in revel; and smooth youths bearing cups for some twenty\r\nothers, all garlanded, besides those on the marble stage; and on the\r\nstage itself a scene of dancing girls, Sevillian, Neapolitan,\r\nAlgerian, mixed with masked Satyrs, which made Hogarth pale, while at a\r\nHerod's-table buried under fruits, wines, flowers and gold, reclined Pat\r\nO'Hara, tonsured now, crowned with ivy and violets, gowned in a violet\r\ntoga; while under a pendulum whose swings left whiffs of incense behind\r\nlay Harris insensible.\r\n\r\nAs Hogarth descended into it, harp and dance ceased; some leapt to their\r\nfeet: but O'Hara sat still, gazing in a dead silence through glairy\r\neyes, while Hogarth, looking about, spied an electric button in a couch,\r\ntouched it, and soon a man in uniform stood at a door above.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” asked Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“John Souttar, head-telegraphist, may it please your Lordship's\r\nMajesty”.\r\n\r\n“Make haste: tell the First Lieutenant and the Chief Constable that the\r\nLord of the Sea is here”.\r\n\r\nBy now all the revellers were on their feet; no sound: only, the\r\nclicking pendulum voyaged, landed an incense-whiff, and voyaged, like\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\nThen the Lieutenant appeared, mottled and panting, and immediately the\r\nConstable.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Royds”, said Hogarth: “is it practicable to flood this room quickly\r\nwith a hose?”\r\n\r\n“I--should think so, my Lord King”.\r\n\r\n“See to it. First set guards at the exits”.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the other: “Mr. Chief Constable, I give all present,\r\nexcept, of course, your Admiral, into custody, on a charge of\r\nmisdemeanour on the high seas. The General Prosecutor will, in due\r\ncourse, forward the indictment to your Summary Court. Have your men here\r\nwith handcuffs”.\r\n\r\nAgain silence, till, in four minutes, two men appeared on the steps,\r\nball-nozzle in hand; upon which Hogarth said to O'Hara: “Follow me”,\r\nand as the two passed up, O'Hara tottery, care hanging on that ponderous\r\nnether-lip, Hogarth whispered the hose-bearers: “Drown the room\r\nwell--man and woman--do not spare”.\r\n\r\nTo O'Hara he said: “Lead to your suite”, and, descending, they presently\r\nstood in a bed-temple, the bed surrounded with mirrors, and at the\r\nother end of the apartment an altar--pyx, six unflickering candles, and\r\nflowers, with rail and reredos, and maxims of St. Theresa.\r\n\r\nHogarth said: “Sleep two hours”, and went out, turning the key.\r\n\r\nBut in half an hour O'Hara had started awake, sober, and, clapping his\r\npalms over his face, burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThat Hogarth might be capable of impeachment before a Court of Admirals,\r\nfollowed by death on the block, he feared; and he rolled, groaning,\r\ntugging his tonsure-fringe, which, on the forehead, lay a thin grey\r\nforelock, thinking: “Guilty wretch that I am! putrid, unwholesome,\r\nhopeless, I have befouled the holiest: how richly do I deserve to die!”;\r\nand even as he groaned and smote, his secret mind weighed up the chances\r\nof Hogarth's action.\r\n\r\nHe rose, listened, rushed to the door, found it locked, tossed up\r\ndespairing hands, and tottered to the altar, at which he knelt, all\r\nsighs, and dying fish-eyes, and sideward-languishing face, and weary\r\nwoe. Ah! how great the mountain of his iniquity: if he might be but once\r\nmore spared, his evil remainder of days he would bury in some Carmelite\r\nretreat, with fastings and prayers; but no--he had too much tempted the\r\nEternal patience, the sword was out against him. Yet he implored, he\r\nimplored with groans: with half an eye, meanwhile, on the door; and,\r\nhaving with regard to Hogarth a piece of secret knowledge which he\r\nguarded deep for some possible emergency and use (the fact of Hogarth's\r\nJewish birth), as he prayed, his brain with complete detachment worked\r\nout the question whether he might now reveal this with advantage.\r\n\r\nHogarth found him kneeling, said “Get up”, and O'Hara stood, leaning\r\nupon the rail, too faint to stand unpropped, Hogarth contemplating him,\r\ntapping the toes.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir! I know all: your whole past”.\r\n\r\n“Red as crimson--!” went O'Hara faintly, with tossed hands.\r\n\r\n“Red enough, Admiral. You are a bad old man: merit death”.\r\n\r\n“Ah, God knows it, my Lord King! I do assure you, I am a leprous wretch:\r\nand I welcome death--I pray you, I pray Heaven, for it--”\r\n\r\n“You should have it, if you were a better, or a younger, man: but I will\r\nnot stain the Empire of which you were chosen to be a stay, and are the\r\nshame, with the blood of such as you. You are beneath judgment: and that\r\nclemency which is our scutcheon I extend to you. Live, therefore, and\r\nrepent, O'Hara. I, however, you understand, now turn from you for ever.\r\nAnd I discharge you like a menial, sir. See to it that within six months\r\nyou have your affairs regulated, and send in your resignation to the\r\nGovernment”.\r\n\r\nHe turned and went; and, as he disappeared, O'Hara straightened, coolly\r\nwent “H'm!”, and took snuff. He lived, he lived: while there is life\r\nthere is fun.\r\n\r\nFumbling about, searching for nothing, all relieved and rescued,\r\nyet stunned, he suddenly exclaimed: “What a noble fellow is my son\r\nHogarth!”, and knelt again.\r\n\r\nHogarth in the same hour was away for England; and on the fourth evening\r\nthence, the street-lamps just lit, stood before No. 11 Market Street,\r\nEdgware Road, come for Margaret; his carriage waiting at a corner forty\r\nyards away; and though within the last hour he had realized vividly\r\nthat his voyage to the _Mahomet_ had given Frankl time to remove her, or\r\naccomplish any devilish device in his power with respect to her, he was\r\nnow all prospect and expectancy.\r\n\r\nThe house was three-storied, mean, unlighted, with an “area”; from a\r\nneighbouring window a woman screaming down to some playing children; and\r\nunder her a shop sending out that fishy fume which “drove Asmodeus back\r\nto hell”.\r\n\r\nHe rapped, received no answer, rapped again without reply, then stepped\r\ndown and back, looking up: and suddenly, faintly, but distinctly, he\r\nheard her voice, high up--_singing_.\r\n\r\n  “O what a pretty place,\r\n   And what a graceful city,\r\n  Where the striplings are so gay,\r\n   And the ladies are so pretty “.\r\n\r\nIt was she! He ran and banged at the door: no reply.\r\n\r\nBack again he stepped; and now a window on the top floor went up, and\r\nshe, putting out her head, twice beckoned him--listlessly, it seemed,\r\nthen drew in; and instantly--again--he heard her sing.\r\n\r\nAs once more he ran to the door, he discovered now that it was open,\r\ndarted into darkness, up uncarpeted stairs, making for that upper room,\r\nvague light through grimy stair-windows guiding his impassioned dash;\r\nand on the third floor entered a room with two doors, beyond one of\r\nwhich was the room he sought: but that door was locked.\r\n\r\nAt it he pushed, fumbled, called: “Margaret!” No reply. And suddenly he\r\nheard her singing, not before, but behind him.\r\n\r\n  “Happy day! Happy day!\r\n  When Jesus washed my sins away “...\r\n\r\nWhen he flew to the other door, and now found it, too, locked, gradually\r\nin that gloom all colour faded from his face; and the voice sang on:\r\n“Happy day! happy day”....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII\r\n\r\nTHE LAND BILL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Manifesto's “month of grace” was passing, yet nothing had been done,\r\nsecond-rate Powers awaiting the Great, while the Great, appalled by the\r\nbigness of the demand, fussed and intrigued, consulted, fermented and\r\nproposed: but did nothing.\r\n\r\nBut at last, on the 3rd of December, the First Lord of the Treasury laid\r\na Bill on the table of our Commons--at the end of an Autumn-session!\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd: and on the 1st the Lord of the Sea had been captured near\r\nEdgware Road, the probability being that this Bill was brought forward\r\nwith a knowledge of that capture.\r\n\r\nIt consisted of three clauses and two schedules--called The Land\r\nPurchase Bill; and it had only to be published to produce the stormiest\r\nagitation ever known.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition was the Jew-Liberal-Labour party; and when the Labour\r\nCongress (met at Manchester) denounced the measure, there occurred a\r\n“split”, a Liberal-Labour cave, the whole body of Jews, numbering 87,\r\nretiring to the Government ranks.\r\n\r\nThe Bill proposed the “purchase” of Britain from its “owners” by the\r\nBritish, the price fixed being 27 times the annual value, to be paid in\r\nsettled annuities for entailed estates, and in consols for unentailed.\r\n\r\nSo, then, the Government would buy London alone for 1400 millions and\r\nBritain for 8000 millions--a bad lookout for England.\r\n\r\nAnd the authors of the Bill chose a moment when Hogarth was living on\r\nbread and poisoned water in Market Street.\r\n\r\nIt rapidly passed to Committee, and then to the Lords.\r\n\r\nBut on that night a terrifying rumour for the first time pervaded\r\nEngland: that the Lord of the Sea, having come to London at the\r\nbeginning of the month, was missing, and that his person had been\r\nclaimed from our Government by the Sea under menaces.\r\n\r\nIn fact, when a week, two weeks, had passed, and not a whisper from\r\nHogarth, apprehension had turned into certainty in the breasts of\r\nQuilter-Beckett, Loveday, and all: and at a hurried Council called\r\nin the _Boodah_ on the 19th, when the date of Hogarth's landing\r\nat Southampton was determined, and his small train-in-waiting, his\r\ncoachman, re-examined for the twentieth time, one certainty emerged:\r\nFrankl had had time to reach England before him; and the arrest of\r\nFrankl was demanded.\r\n\r\nNow England in consternation almost forgot the Land Bill; Scotland\r\nYard ransacked Market Street: not a trace of Hogarth; it dissected\r\nthe country for Frankl: but Frankl was now in the _Mahomet_, safely\r\nconferring with O'Hara.\r\n\r\nThe popular tempest first directed itself against the League of\r\nResistance: and at an attack upon its Offices in Victoria Street during\r\nthe afternoon of the 21st Viscount Reid (the Secretary), and a girl,\r\nwere killed by missiles; petitions signed by the nation raining\r\nmeanwhile upon the Prince of Wales: for, apart from the wreck which\r\nthreatened, Hogarth's popularity was at present considerable with the\r\nmasses, whose instincts suspected those above them of knowing more of\r\nhis disappearance than appeared.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 22nd, when things had an air of revolution,\r\nfifty-three men met in a house in Adair Street, W. (This runs parallel\r\nto Market Street, the backs of the two house-rows facing.)\r\n\r\nThese were the warders of Hogarth: and the object of that night's\r\nmeeting was to determine whether he should die, and when, and how;\r\nthe Land Bill now awaiting the Royal Assent; and on the morrow British\r\nhigh-sea trade to be ruthlessly stopped, failing news of Hogarth.\r\n\r\nThe room was double, with an arch in the partition, through which ran\r\na rough-board table surrounded with velvet arm-chairs; the floor\r\nrichly carpeted, though paper peeled from the walls; down the table\r\na procession of silver candlesticks and typewritten notice-papers\r\nand agenda; the windows boarded--a second floor; and in a room near,\r\nHogarth, shackled hand and foot, he having been borne through a\r\nsubterranean way, made for the purpose, from the cellar in Market Street\r\nto this Adair Street.\r\n\r\nFrom eight o'clock men began to let themselves in at the two doors in\r\nboth streets, and continued to arrive till nine, when a marquis at the\r\ntable-head rose to speak, the others leaning back with downcast eyes,\r\nnearly all pale.\r\n\r\nThe point before them was plainly put by the speaker on the Question:\r\nviz., whether they had more to fear from the life, or from the death, of\r\nthe Lord of the Sea.\r\n\r\n“By a strange Providence”, he said, “this man is in our hands: and we\r\nhave the right to become his executioners. My Lords and Gentlemen, the\r\nawful decision rests with you to-night”.\r\n\r\nThen, one after another, they rose, they spoke: no two views identical;\r\ntill at ten it was voted that the question be put, voting papers went\r\nround, and presently the ballot-result was announced amid a momentous\r\nstillness.\r\n\r\nTwenty-eight had voted for the death, twenty-five against.\r\n\r\nBut in that minute a key was heard in the room door, and in rushed two\r\nflushed men: Frankl and O'Hara, just arrived in London from the sea; and\r\nFrankl burst into speech:\r\n\r\n“I hope this is all right, my lords, my coming like this, and bringing\r\ninto your very midst a gentleman who is not one of us. When I tell you\r\nthat he is Admiral Donald of the _Mahomet_, turned away like a servant,\r\nhow does that make your lordships feel? A house divided against itself\r\ncan't stand; and this gentleman has a scheme in his pocket--he will read\r\nit to your lordships--which will crack up the Empire of the Sea like an\r\negg-shell! So I do hope, my lords, that you have not decided anything\r\nhasty about putting away Richard Hogarth: for unless he is liberated\r\nthis night, it means sure and certain stoppage of everything tomorrow:\r\nand _that_ means my ruin, and many another's beside--”\r\n\r\nNow the Master called him to order, and addressed himself to O'Hara,\r\nwho, in admiral's uniform and stars, all stately bows, grave smiles, in\r\nten minutes had given guarantees, was a member, and in thirty had read a\r\nmemorandum of a scheme of betrayal which everyone saw to be feasible.\r\n\r\nThen the vote of death was annulled; and when the meeting broke up\r\nHogarth was being lifted with bandaged eyes through the subterranean\r\nway to Market Street, where four men deposited him near the house-door,\r\nundid his ropes, said to him “You are free”, and there he remained\r\ntwenty minutes without motion, deadly sick, then rose, and, on finding\r\nthe door, went wildly with dragged feet, tottered into a cab, and leant\r\nbrow on hand.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the porch of his Berkeley Square house, Loveday rushed out\r\nto his knees with adoring eyes, having hardly hoped to see again that\r\nface of Hogarth, while Hogarth patted the bowed head, saying: “Do get me\r\na meal, and let me hear what has been going on....Oh, I am weary “.\r\n\r\nAnd during the meal he heard all: of the Land Bill, the turmoil.\r\n\r\n“Well, my God!” he exclaimed, “is there no drop of generous blood at\r\nall among those people? Never again do I trust them to make their own\r\narrangements I When does this precious Bill have the Royal Assent?”\r\n\r\n“To-morrow, it is supposed”.\r\n\r\n“Really!”--he started: “and whereabouts is the Prince of Wales?”\r\n\r\n“At Windsor to-night”.\r\n\r\n“Order the motor quick. I'll go”.\r\n\r\nHe was soon off, and Loveday, listening to the dark story of Margaret's\r\nappearing and singing, and vanishing, accompanied him under a frosty\r\nmoon, snow lying on village-street and hedge; but, travelling hard, they\r\narrived shortly after one upon a Prince who, a wakeful man that night,\r\nsat conferring with Private Secretary and Attorney-General, he having\r\nassented to the introduction of the Land Bill, then been alarmed by the\r\nstorm, and now was confronted with the responsibility of either giving\r\nHis Majesty's assent, and earning execration, or refusing it, and taking\r\na step unheard-of since William III.\r\n\r\nIn that state of embarrassment he was, when the Lord of the Sea was\r\nannounced, and “It is with heartiest pleasure that I offer to your\r\nLordship's Majesty my congratulations on this re-appearance”, he said,\r\ngreatly and gladly surprised, without at all seeming so.\r\n\r\nAnd the two conferred till three, when a secretary, at Hogarth's\r\ndictation, wrote a document and its duplicate: a contract between Prince\r\nand King, giving pledges on each side, private, yet most momentous; and\r\neach, having signed both copies, retained one.\r\n\r\nThe next evening the Clerk in the Lords uttered those unusual words:\r\n“_Le Roy s'avisera_,” and the country was thrown into transport by the\r\nnews of the Royal rejection of the Land Bill, processions singing the\r\nNational Anthem, bells ringing: and for a month the mention of a Royal\r\nname in any assembly brought the people to their feet.\r\n\r\nMinisters, of course, resigned; and, as the Liberals refused office,\r\nwrits for a new House were made returnable for the end of January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV\r\n\r\nTHE REGENCY\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next month England was in a general-election turmoil; at the\r\nsame time a Land Bill in the French Chamber, and one in the Reichstag,\r\nwas thrown out: whereupon a _ukase_ from the _Boodah_ announced the\r\nraising of sea-rent to 5s. on all ships over 2000 tons after the 1st\r\nFebruary, the month of grace over, the “screw tightening”.\r\n\r\nAlready distress in England was great, coal being at three-and-sixpence,\r\nbread at nine pence; a cry had arisen for the Union of Britain with\r\nthe Sea; and on the 27th of January a plebiscite among the Trade Unions\r\nresulted in an affirmative vote of five millions out of an electorate of\r\nnine.\r\n\r\nNow, at this time the bulletins respecting His Majesty were of a settled\r\ndepression: he lived, but languished; and it was understood that the new\r\nMinistry's first act would be the appointment of a Regency.\r\n\r\nThen appeared a rumour: alterations were going forward at Buckingham\r\nPalace on a scale of splendour new to Western mansions; the Prince of\r\nWales had passed three days, from the 17th to the 19th, in the _Boodah_:\r\nand the saying went that, on the night of the rejection of the Land\r\nBill, a compact had taken place between the Prince and the Sea for a\r\nthree years' Regency of the latter.\r\n\r\nExcitement ensued, the matter becoming an election test: and 180 Labour\r\nMembers, with 70 Liberals were returned pledged to support a Regency of\r\nthe Sea.\r\n\r\nA definite coalition, meantime, had been announced between the Jews and\r\nthe Conservatives.\r\n\r\nNever was election so rolled in dust and noise, in the result the Jews\r\nhaving the casting vote: and if ever race was looked at askance, it was\r\nthey now by the British.\r\n\r\nThe session having been opened by Commission, a resolution passed Lords\r\nand Commons that the Prince of Wales be empowered to exercise the Royal\r\nAuthority; whereupon the Prince at the palace, having heard the Address,\r\nread a reply, sufficiently startling to the country, though well\r\nforeknown to those present: he laid stress upon the new conditions of\r\nthe world--that phlegmatic eye, which had seen so much, lifting a moment\r\nin punctuation to dwell coldly upon his hearers, then coldly reading\r\nagain; the difficulties, he said, which he was called upon to face on\r\nbehalf of His Majesty were not lightly to be undertaken, and his fuller\r\nanswer would be contained in a proposal which he would make in the Lords\r\nas a peer of the realm.\r\n\r\nThe next night in a crowded House he read a speech distinguished by\r\nextraordinary dignity and severity: “My lords”, he said at one point,\r\nslapping the table, though those eyes remained royally null: “when\r\nwill your lordships learn to recognize the facts of life?” and, having\r\nproposed His Lordship's Majesty, the Lord of the Sea, to be Regent\r\nduring His Majesty's illness, such Regency not to exceed a period of\r\nthree years, he recommended a plebiscite.\r\n\r\nNo plebiscite was taken: for within some days the sense of the\r\nconstituencies was revealed, and the Leader in the Lords received stern\r\nhints from the Liberal Leader, which damped pride: so their lordships\r\nabstained from Westminster, their Resolution being passed by just a\r\nquorum.\r\n\r\nThe country wondered at the ease with which the whole went off--not\r\nknowing that those who might have led resistance had a thought, and a\r\nprospect, inspired by one Pat O'Hara, which comforted them.\r\n\r\nAnd now a Deputation of Five took boat in the _Prince George_, to wait\r\nupon the Lord of the Sea in the _Boodah_ Throne Room, where the Lord\r\nPresident read the information that they were a Committee appointed to\r\nattend His Lordship's Majesty with the Resolutions of the Houses.\r\n\r\n“We are instructed”, he read, “to express the hope which the Lords\r\nSpiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, entertain, that His Lordship's\r\nMajesty, from his regard to the interests of His Majesty the King, will\r\nbe ready to undertake the weighty and important trust proposed to be\r\ninvested in His Lordship's Majesty, as soon as an Act of Parliament\r\nshall have been passed for carrying the same into effect”.\r\n\r\nHe then read, and delivered, the Resolutions.\r\n\r\nHogarth replied, reading: “My Lords and Gentlemen, I receive the\r\ncommunication which your two Houses have instructed you to make to me\r\nwith those sentiments of regard which I ever entertain for your two\r\nHouses. Deeply impressed with the necessity of tranquillizing the public\r\nmind throughout the world, I do not hesitate to accept the office and\r\nsituation proposed to me”.\r\n\r\nSo the Deputation departs; five days later twelve British battleships\r\nsurround the _Boodah_, come to accompany the Lord of the Sea to England;\r\nand at eleven on the morning of the 9th, his yacht, borne in on the\r\nstrong thunders of a royal salute, drops anchor in Southampton Water.\r\n\r\nHe had set so gorgeous a standard of luxury to Europe, that no one\r\ndreamed of making his entry into London an ordinary _fête_; and, as the\r\nprocession traversed the triumphal arches of Piccadilly, he, swept to\r\nthe gods in the lap of gallant sublimities, plumes, sabres, showering\r\nhoofs, squad-troops, outriders, showed to the Prince beside him and to\r\nthe Czarowitz before him a miniature of Rebecca Frankl.\r\n\r\nSome streets cheered--not all much: but during the illuminated night all\r\nLondon seemed to abandon itself to revelry.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Hogarth went in state to the Chapel Royal for\r\ncertificate of Communion, attended by heralds, Sergeants-at-mace,\r\nsword-of-state, the Duke of York; and after “the service” communicated\r\nunder a canopy at the hand of the Bishop of London.\r\n\r\nThen, on the 14th, Lords and Commons had a final conference over the\r\nRegency Bill, when the Assistant of the Parliaments uttered the worlds:\r\n“_Le Roy le Veult_”; and on the 15th, the swearing-in day, a party\r\nof grenadiers with colours and fifes marched into the palace grounds,\r\ncontinuously to play “God Save the King”; while yeomen and ushers,\r\ntogether with servants-in-state of the Lord of the Sea, lined the great\r\nhall and staircase, life-guardsmen lining a vista of state-apartments\r\nending in a Blue-velvet Room, recently decorated; by 2.30 P.M. Privy\r\nCouncillors commenced to arrive, till at 3.45 P.M. the Lord of the Sea\r\nsent Admiral Quilter-Beckett to the President of the Council, ordering\r\nhis presence; and presently was himself seen coming up the vista,\r\naccompanied by his own household-officers, to the Blue-velvet Room where\r\nhe sat at the table-head, the Royal personages on each hand, his own\r\nofficers ranged on each side of the entrance-arch; and now one by one\r\nentered the full-dressed Councillors, with bows which he returned,\r\ntaking seat according to precedence--Canterbury, then the Lord\r\nChancellor, then York; and last came and sat a certain Mr. Forrest,\r\nKeeper of the Records.\r\n\r\nHogarth then rose and said:\r\n\r\n“My Lords: I understand that by the Act passed by your Parliament\r\nappointing me Regent of this Empire, I am required to take certain\r\noaths, as prescribed by the said Act: I am now ready to take these oaths\r\n“.\r\n\r\nWhereupon rose the Lord Privy Seal, made a reverence, approached, and\r\nread, while Hogarth pronounced after him:\r\n\r\n“I sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful and bear true\r\nallegiance to His Majesty King George. So help me, God.\r\n\r\n“I do solemnly promise and swear that I will truly and faithfully\r\nexecute the Office of Regent of the King's Empire according to an Act\r\nof Parliament entitled 'an Act, etc.', and that I will, etc. So help me,\r\nGod”.\r\n\r\nHe then subscribed the two oaths, and after him the Privy Councillors,\r\nthe Lord President first, as witnesses. It was then delivered to the\r\nRecord Keeper, who deposited it in a box, while Hogarth presented his\r\nLord's-Supper certificate: whereupon the Lord President bent the knee\r\nand kissed his hand, then the Royal personages, then the Archbishops,\r\nadvancing in order on both sides.\r\n\r\nIt was a week of Hope, the turning over of a new leaf, so the spirit\r\nof festival reigned, and was deepened when the evening papers that day\r\nannounced that a _ukase_ of the Sea had reduced rent on British ships by\r\n1s. 9d. per ton, and was heightened when during that and the following\r\nnights Hogarth dispensed three millions in fêting England: his\r\nilluminations having no resemblance to those sickly twinklings,\r\ntremulous at their own cost, previously deemed good enough for the\r\njubilee-days of an empire; the people were astonished: ample and\r\nplanetary his mind, his hand right royal, and London, bursting into\r\nlight, flashed tidings of our earth to Mars. It was incredible then that\r\nany had ever wept, or would weep again; the bitterest foes of the Regent\r\ncaught the contagion of world-gala; Europe flocked to London; theatres\r\nwere gratis; the illusion of the comet of the final night was complete,\r\nher lurid rays sprawling 2000 feet aloft in stiff portentousness,\r\nprophesying Change, the parks all transfigured into universes of moons,\r\ncrescents, stars, jerbs, Roman-candles, _pots de brin_, girandoles of\r\nrockets, pagodas, marquees, each tree a net of fireflies, while from\r\nfive hundred and thirty balloons, with silent burst, snowed diverse\r\nfires.\r\n\r\nThe new reign opened with promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV\r\n\r\nESTRELLA, THE PROPHETESS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor three weeks a Provisional Ministry carried on the Government,\r\nconfining itself to Supply; till, on the 3rd March, the Lord Regent\r\nsucceeded in forming a Cabinet; and at 9 on the evening of the 5th for\r\nthe first time addressed himself to the country in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\nThat night the world seemed hushed to listen, the peridom of Britain\r\npacking the Gallery with rainbow, and the peerdom those benches and\r\ncross-benches, red as massacre and the Scarlet Woman, where thronged\r\n580, while to Charing Cross spread the crowd without. He, from the\r\nThrone, addressed them, and they, startled by the revelation of a caste\r\nchaster far than Vere de Vere, and a pride far more serenely throned\r\nthan Hohenzollern, acknowledged him high-born... “Your lordships will\r\nnot fail to perceive my will to invigorate some of our ancient epithets:\r\nthus, the First Estate of the Realm shall, during the present Regency,\r\nbe veritably 'First', and in no case last”; anon he blew his bugle: “Let\r\nus play the man!--easy to say, hard to do: yet it was first said by an\r\nEnglishman when the doing, I think, was hard enough, his martyr's\r\nshroud already rapt aloft in flame: _that_ was magnanimous, my lords, I\r\ndeclare! _there_ was the British Lion”....\r\n\r\nThat same night a new Land Bill was introduced by Sir Robert Wortley,\r\nthe Prime Minister--a bill drafted, criticized, and re-altered during\r\ntwo years by the legal experts of the Sea, proposing the “purchase” of\r\nGreat Britain at a price of twice the annual value for inherited land,\r\nand seven times for land held by purchase: this to be paid in two and\r\nseven years respectively, without interest, lands yielding no revenue\r\nto become crown-lands from the date of the Bill, which was called: Land\r\nDepartment (Creation) Bill.\r\n\r\nIt passed first reading; but the question was: would the Jews vote for\r\nthe second reading? Reluctant enough the Jewish members, but there\r\nwere rumours that the Jewish electorate were instructing their\r\nrepresentatives to repent and vote for.\r\n\r\nAnd now spread far the League of Resistance, so did the Adair Street\r\nSociety, its secret daughter, of which Admiral Donald (O'Hara) had now\r\nbeen elected Honorary Vice-Master, and whose Roll contained the names of\r\nan extraordinary number of Territorial officers.\r\n\r\nThe Society was busy: had building four yachts, all models of the\r\nAdmiral's yacht attached to the _Mahomet_, which was called the _Mahomet\r\nII_; every dusk companies of 25 to 40 men drilled darkly in the back\r\nyard at Adair Street, some of them Territorial officers: in rotation\r\nthey came, they drilled, over 1000; a top room piled with revolvers,\r\nswords, bowie-knives...\r\n\r\nFor the land-magnates laughed at the notion of submitting to the Bill:\r\nrather, said they, “rivers of blood”. The mention by Hogarth of Ridley\r\nand Latimer they considered irrelevant; their fathers' heroic mood was a\r\ndetail: not an entail.\r\n\r\nIn secret they met. Anarchists of the reddest hue.\r\n\r\nOne night when the Bill was approaching second-reading Frankl introduced\r\nHarris as a member; and wide-eyed stood Harris, though still cynical,\r\nwith elegant walking-stick, hat cocked, and “I sye”, he whispered, “are\r\nall these real, living lords?”\r\n\r\n“Large as life”, answered Frankl.\r\n\r\n“Strike me dotty! The Lord said unto my lord, sit thou at my right\r\nhand”...the reason of this introduction of Harris being a relation which\r\nhad arisen between the Army and the Lord Regent, who had been taking\r\na startling interest in this branch of the services, had visited\r\nAldershot, and held five reviews, flattering the soldier by private\r\nnotice, shifting officers. By an Order in Council of the 3rd March, a\r\nreorganization was effected in the Army Board and Consultative Council,\r\nof the new men the Adjutant-General being General Sir Merrick Parr,\r\nuncle of Admiral Parr of the sea-fort _Shakespeare_, while the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and Inspector-General were the direct creations of\r\nthe Regent, and the whole Headquarters Staff bound to follow him through\r\nthick and thin; and that “second reading” was near, which, if the Jews\r\nwould vote against, well and good for Adair Street, but, if not, there\r\nremained either (1) the prompt execution of O'Hara's scheme without\r\nwaiting for the four yachts, copies of the _Mahomet II_, which were slow\r\nin building; or (2) the knife of Harris.\r\n\r\nBut, as to (1), when three delegates from the Society had waited upon\r\nO'Hara in the _Mahomet_ to urge immediate action, O'Hara had replied:\r\n“No, my lords, I cannot enter into this undertaking until preparations\r\nare complete, since the troops we send would never be allowed to land\r\non the forts, if they arrived in ships not apparently our own. Your\r\nlordships cannot be more anxious than I to rid the earth of a devouring\r\nlion like Richard Hogarth, I do assure you; but, tut, is there nothing\r\nelse meanwhile? Just let me introduce to your lordships a little young\r\nman whom I know”--he had summoned Harris.\r\n\r\nBut when the three delegates had gone, he had struck his brow,\r\nexclaiming: “Wretch that I am!--that great and good fellow, the fairest\r\nof the sons of men!...what a black depravity must be in this heart--”\r\n he had underlooked in the mirror, and cut a face; “but ah, Hogarth! this\r\nheart is in your net; and I loved the mother, too”....\r\n\r\nHe had sought the altar, and that night had written piteously to\r\nHogarth, appealing for fresh friendship and reconsideration of his\r\nsentence of dismissal.\r\n\r\nSo, at any rate, was Harris introduced to Adair Street, became its chief\r\nminister, and ten days before the second-reading debate had won, by\r\nO'Hara's recommendation, an _entrée_ into the Palace as servant to a\r\ngentleman-usher-daily-waiter: and now he made bright the knife of the\r\nassassin, tending its edge as a gardener the tender sprout, the knife\r\nbeing his _métier_ and forte, he despising the noisy, mediate, uncertain\r\npistol, nor could use it, his instincts belonging to the Stone Age. But\r\nthe days passed, and he could by no means get near to Hogarth.\r\n\r\nOne night he boldly penetrated to the royal antechamber with the knife\r\nunder his waist-band, having passed the stairs-guard by a specious\r\nofficial envelope. As it was late, he thought it must be about the\r\nRegent's bedtime, having the vaguest ideas as to royal ways and\r\nbedtimes, Hogarth being then in a consultation with three of the Cabinet\r\ndestined to last till morning. And Harris: “Can I see the Lord Regent?”\r\n with that lifted brow of perpetual surprise and alertness.\r\n\r\n“You? Who are you?” asked a gentleman-in-waiting.\r\n\r\n“That's neither 'ere nor there, if it comes to that. I'm Captain\r\nMacnaghten's man, then”.\r\n\r\n“But what is it you want?”\r\n\r\n“He told me to give the Regent this 'ere”--showing the envelope.\r\n\r\n“Weally! then, give it to me”.\r\n\r\n“He said I was to give it to the Regent's self”.\r\n\r\n“Then, go to blazes quickly, will you? and let Captain Macnaghten know\r\nfwom me that he has been dwinking”.\r\n\r\nHarris could not penetrate the ten-fold barrier; but he lay in wait;\r\nwatched from some coign every Royal exit and entrance, careful that\r\nHogarth never saw his face; and he cherished the knife-edge.\r\n\r\nOne night, four days before the debate, he stood by the Green Park\r\nrailings, listless, smoking, when--he started: saw a hurried figure come\r\nout--face muffled--Hogarth!--alone.\r\n\r\nHogarth walked a little, entered a cab; Harris, in another, shadowed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nDown Piccadilly, the Hammersmith Road, into the Addison: Hogarth\r\nalighted; Harris followed.\r\n\r\nNow, at this time Hogarth had a spy, who presented him reports of the\r\ndoings of Rebekah Frankl--a species of literature which the Regent found\r\nagreeable; and, as for two days Rebekah had, for some reason, been at a\r\nvilla of Addison Road, this escapade of the Lord Regent was motived by\r\nhis hope of catching there some glimpse of her, the house being small,\r\nhe having seized his first chance of secret escape from state-affairs\r\nnear midnight: and behind him, like the shadow of death, stole the\r\nassassin.\r\n\r\nHogarth, going soft up to the house, leaned aside from the frontage\r\nsteps to peer; but Venetian blinds barred him from the least sight\r\nof the interior, though he could hear sounds, strange sounds, as of\r\nwailing; and, as the villa was in the midst of quite a spacious ground,\r\nwell grown with trees and shrubberies, he stole round to the back,\r\npeered into an open door level with the garden, and within saw a doorway\r\nof twilight in the midst of darkness; had hoped to see a servant, who\r\nmight talk gossip, or even contrive him sight of the Sacred Body; had\r\nready bribe in hand: but nobody there. So, after some hesitation, he\r\nentered; and Harris, just then come to the house-corner on tiptoe,\r\ndiscerned him go in, ran on hot bricks to the door, and now distinctly\r\nsaw Hogarth, who had passed through a kitchen, standing on three wooden\r\nsteps before a doorway which framed a faint light in the room beyond.\r\n\r\nOn which a shivering of eagerness, quick as winking sheet-lightning,\r\nshook Harris' right knee.\r\n\r\nHogarth, meantime, having seen the chamber before him empty, in his\r\nheadlong way had entered, and the guess now in Harris' mind was this:\r\n“It's a girl: a night out”....\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, Hogarth being once within the house and lost to him, but\r\nafter some minutes dared to follow.\r\n\r\nHogarth, meantime, had seen that the light came from a death-taper, with\r\nwhich was a vessel of water for ceremonial purification, and a napkin,\r\nhere being all the preparations for _tahara_ (washing); and suddenly,\r\nin a near room, arose the clamorous dole of _shivah_ (the seven\r\nmourning-days), Rachel weeping for her children, because they are not:\r\na Jew was dead: “shema, Yisrael...”: and this explained Rebekah's stay\r\nthere, for the bereaved may not leave the house. A peer at the bed--a\r\ncovered face--pierced him with a compunction like shame: here was\r\n_kodesh_, and he a desecrator with his earthy passion: so he turned to\r\nbeat a retreat by the way he had come--when a faint sound that way, made\r\nby Harris; and, instead, he leapt lightly through a window five feet\r\nabove the garden.\r\n\r\nSome moments later Harris, entering on prowling all-fours, and seeing\r\nthe bed-clothes hang immediately near, stole under; waited: no sound\r\nsave the singsong lament; and “O Gawd”, thought he, cynic even in his\r\npalest agitation, “there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing\r\nof teeth”....But that Hogarth had not come to wail and gnash he felt\r\nconvinced: if he heard no sound above him, that might be because of the\r\nsounds around; so he crawled barely out, and, kneeling, put up a most\r\ncautious groping hand, the bed being in the darkest part of the room;\r\nsomeone there: and swiftly as a dolphin twists to dart and snap,\r\nhis knife was in a breast and instantly ready to strike its expected\r\nbedfellow.\r\n\r\nBut the breast was alone, the breast of Estrella, the Prophetess, four\r\ndays dead.\r\n\r\nHarris snatched off the face-cloth, peered upon a noble old visage,\r\nfixed now in trance, and said: “Well, I'm--”\r\n\r\nNow he ran, but in the kitchen stopped wild-eyed. It I might be\r\nmurder-he was not certain; at least it was out-rage, and he might be\r\ntraced: there was the cabman who had brought him--his absence from\r\nthe Palace---“Bah! it can't be proved....” But still, if he were even\r\narrested, and Hogarth got to hear of his presence about the Court--that\r\nwould spoil all. He listened: all that part of the house a settled\r\nsolitude, the servants themselves sitting _shivah_; and back he ran,\r\nseized upon the little old body, not now stiff, _rigor mortis_ having\r\npassed, saw that the sheet was unstained, and snatched her away out\r\nto the bottom of the garden where shrubbery and holly-hedge formed a\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nNow he set to dig with hissing haste; and, even as he hissed and digged,\r\nhe talked without pause, envenomed, heaping her sanctity with insult:\r\n“Old cat you...dust to dust and ashes to ashes, it is....What you want\r\nto do that for? under you go in the cold, cold sod....Who arst you to\r\nput your little finger in the pie? There's another one for you, fair in\r\nthe gullet! Now take her up tenderly, lift her with care-and down she\r\ngoes”....\r\n\r\nSuch were Estrella's _kaddish_ and “House of Life”....As he had only the\r\nknife, and the work was slow, and in the midst of it an outcry from the\r\nhouse, the body missed, he stopped, listening, but without acute fear,\r\nknowing it improbable that they could dream of seeking in the grounds,\r\nand as a matter of fact their minds were a mere paralysis of holy\r\nwonder; so presently he had the little body in a two-foot grave,\r\narranged surface and dead leaves to naturalness, leapt a wall, and got\r\naway.\r\n\r\nNever did act of assassin have result so momentous: for though the\r\npredictions of Estrella had lately spread far among upper-class Jews, it\r\nwas only on the day after her burial by Harris that her fame reached to\r\neach Jew under the sun.\r\n\r\nIt was given out that divine confirmation had been vouchsafed to her\r\nprophecies by the snatching of her body, like Enoch's, into Heaven, or\r\nby its burial, like Moses', by Jahvah: for when no explanation but one\r\nis extant, the brain fastens upon that, and embraces it.\r\n\r\nAnd as Estrella, who, in life, had guarded her hard sayings for the few,\r\nhad left papers revealing for her whole race what she had dreamed, like\r\nwildfire now ran her message among the Chosen.\r\n\r\nNow Temple and Synagogue were crowded: rabbi and pawnbroker and\r\n_maggid,_ clothes-man and _takif,_ were infected; and there spread the\r\ncry (for the most part meaningless): “To Zion!”\r\n\r\nIt may be that the Jewish electorate were now too agitated with the near\r\nprobability of Shiloh to interest themselves in any mundane question: at\r\nall events, it was during that rage that the Government-whips announced\r\nthe certainty that the Jewish members would vote against the Land Bill.\r\n\r\nHogarth first heard it pretty late at night from the Prime Minister; and\r\n“Ha!-the Jews”, he went: “so they have dared, these men? I never thought\r\nthat they would! May God deliver me from His ill-chosen people--!”\r\n\r\n“And ill-choosing, it seems, my Lord King”.\r\n\r\n“Quite so! But, Sir Robert Wortley, is it supportable this thing?”--a\r\nbrand now on his brow--“an alien race in Britain opposing thus daringly\r\nnot _my_ will only, but the plain will of the people? And have I the air\r\nof one who will support it? Rather, I assure you, would I govern without\r\na Parliament! But stop--perhaps I shall be found capable of dealing with\r\nthese mischievous children of Israel. Give me a night: and to-morrow\r\nat noon come, and hear. Of course, this second-reading business must be\r\npostponed “.\r\n\r\nAnd deep and wide, in lonely vigil, wrought the Regent's thought that\r\nnight, till morning: of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of tendencies,\r\nhistories, soils, ports, railways, possibilities, race-genius,\r\nanalogies, destinies; of Rothschild and I Solomon; of Hirsch and Y'hudah\r\nHanassi; of the Jewish Board of Guardians, Rab Asa, and the Targum on\r\nthe Babylonish Talmud; of the Barbary Jews, the Samaritans, and Y'hudah\r\nHalevi; of the Colonial Bank, and the Karaite Jews....\r\n\r\nWhen at dawn he threw himself dressed into bed, he had resolved upon\r\na very great thing: their expulsion from England, Pole and Hungarian,\r\nBaron and coster, and the little child at the breast, ten millions.\r\n\r\nHis eyes had closed toward sleep when, with a start, he remembered a\r\nprophecy uttered one evening in the _Boodah_ Throne-room, and these\r\nwords: “Richard, deal gently with my people....”\r\n\r\nTwo nights later, with a retinue, he hurriedly left England-for\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER IN COUNCIL\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days before that setting-out, O'Hara's appeal for pardon had come\r\nunder the Regent's notice: and as he had read, his eyes--once more--had\r\nsoftened, as he had thought: “It would be a great crime to forgive him\r\nthe long list; but never mind--we will see”....\r\n\r\nAnd he had meant to reply, but suddenly the Jews had swept O'Hara quite\r\nout of his mind.\r\n\r\nHe was away hardly two weeks: and when he returned, Palestine\r\nand western Armenia were his, all his acts of this period bearing\r\nresemblance in largeness and rage to the incredible forced-marches of\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\nIf one spreads apart the first two fingers, he sees exactly the country\r\nordained by Hogarth for modern Israel: the first finger Palestine,\r\nlooking upon the Mediterranean; between the fingers, the Syrian Desert;\r\nthe second (longer) finger that Mesopotamia, “the cradle of our race”\r\n between the Euphrates and the Tigris, this opening upon the Persian\r\nGulf, and the trade of the East.\r\n\r\nThe then population of this area was only 300,000 (Arabs, Turks, Jews,\r\nGreeks) in the Palestine finger, omitting Russian pilgrims to Jerusalem;\r\nwhile in the Mesopotamia finger--all that Hinterland of Palestine called\r\n“Turkish Armenia”--not 320,000 Armenians had been left by Khurdish\r\nrapine and Turkish atrocity: we may therefore say that the whole was an\r\nuninhabited land waiting for inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe only things needed (according to modern notions) to make it\r\nimmediately colonizable were roads and railways, and the Regent had not\r\nreturned to Dover when both were making in Palestine, the Sultan, left\r\nthunderstruck with a chronic eye of scare by that visit, “lending his\r\nco-operation”, consoled meanwhile by a Conversion Loan of thirteen\r\nmillions out of Sea-revenue; to which add a grant-in-aid of fifteen\r\nmillions to the emigrants, and the remark of Hogarth's Chancellor about\r\nthis time becomes intelligible: “Your Lordship's Majesty's expenditure\r\nis exceeding revenue by 50 per cent”; so that Beech's was soon realizing\r\nconsiderably in bonds over Europe, and Hogarth temporarily poor--had\r\nstubbornly refused any Parliament-grant for the Regent's personal\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly from the blue fell his bolt: at that same table of\r\nthe Regent's oath-of-office assembled eighty-seven Jewish lords and\r\ngentlemen at noon of the 24th March, the first day of the month Nisan in\r\nthe Jewish year 5699, ordered, each by himself, to the Royal presence;\r\nand the Regent, with the gravest eyes, both palms pressed on the table,\r\nin an embarrassment of compunction, rose and spoke with them--Rothschild\r\nand merchant-prince, Chief Rabbi, Manchester Chief Minister, Heads of\r\nthe Alliance Israélite, Anglo-Jewish Association, Jewish Board, Jewish\r\nphilanthropists, writers; and they could not believe themselves awake.\r\n\r\nHe began by speaking of himself, the fact of his power, with such\r\ngraciousness, that all were affected, not by the power, but by the\r\ngentleness which wielded it: Providence had given him the disposal of\r\nthe earth, and it was for him to do his poor best--a lonesome, sorrowful\r\npost; so that talking could never alter in anything the main point; but\r\nit could modify details: and he had called them to invoke their great\r\nadministrative gift and expert counsel; he told of the exodus which he\r\ndesigned, the home which he had prepared them; recommended a Sanhedrim\r\nof Chief Jews to form the Provisional Government of the new State, with\r\nthe Chief Rabbi as its head under the title of Shophet (Judge); would\r\noffer a contribution of £ 15,000,000 from his Exchequer toward an\r\nemigration and colonizing fund, and doubtless emigration bureaus would\r\nbe at once established at principal centres; he would also hand over\r\na Deed of Gift of this larger Judaea as between the Sea and the Jewish\r\npeople to the Central Authority as soon as established; also, duplicates\r\nof the text of the Treaty as between the Sea and the Ottoman Empire.\r\nWhat he gave he gave, he assured them, with a free heart, without\r\ncondition; except, of course, one: that no inch of the new land should\r\never “belong” to any particular Jew: for he gave, as Nature gave the\r\nearth, not to a hundred, but to all, living and to be born, occupiers\r\nto pay rent, not to any adventurer calling himself landlord, but to the\r\nCentral Authority, representing all. This done, he would invoke with\r\nconfidence upon their able race the blessing of Almighty God.\r\n\r\nIn tones so mellow did he utter himself, that for many minutes stillness\r\nreigned, every face pale.\r\n\r\nUntil a baron stood up with ashen under-lip, to say that such a scheme,\r\nit seemed to him, must remain for ever abortive, unless enforced by Act\r\nof Parliament--\r\n\r\nBut Hogarth checked him quick.\r\n\r\n“No, my lord, not by Act of Parliament: the how your lordship may leave\r\nto me. I dare say you will see it in this evening's papers”.\r\n\r\nIt was by an Order in Council!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“DECLARATION of the Court of Great Britain respecting the Order in\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\n“At the Court at Buckingham Palace, the 24th day of March, his\r\nLordship's Majesty, the Lord Regent, in Council.\r\n\r\n“WHEREAS His Lordship's Majesty was pleased to declare in the name and\r\non behalf of His Majesty the King on the 23rd day of March: THAT if at\r\nany time, after the expiration of the three months following, any of the\r\nhereinafter mentioned trades, occupations, pursuits, or acts, shall\r\nbe carried on or done within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and\r\nIreland by any person being a person coming within the sense of the term\r\n“Jew” as hereinafter defined, THEN and thereafter such person shall be\r\nliable to the pains and penalties hereinafter specified”.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo Jew might own or work land, or teach in any Cheder or school, or\r\nbe entered at any Public School or University, or sign any stamped\r\ndocument, or carry on certain trades, or vote, or officiate at any\r\npublic service, and so on: parentage, not religion, constituting a\r\n“Jew”. Through Britain this piece of Russian despotism sent a wave of\r\nquiet gladness, and an epidemic of jest broke out, in club, factory,\r\n“Lane”, and drawing-room: “You hurry up--to Jericho!” became the\r\nworkman's answer to a Jew; it was remarked that the chimney of train and\r\nsteamship would furnish a new pillar of cloud by day, and pillar of fire\r\nby night, to go before the modern Exodus; they were little to be pitied,\r\nfor even Heaven was their mortgagor in land, with promise to pay--the\r\nPromised Land; a syndicate would be formed to “pool” milk and honey, and\r\neither Sharon or Salem would become the new Get-O at any price; being a\r\nrather Peculiar People, they would call the new Temple “the 'Ouse” (of\r\nPrey-ers), and make contango-day coincide with Passover....But let him\r\nlaugh that is of a merry heart: as for Israel, with weary breast and\r\nhunted stare he sandalled his foot for the final Exodus: yet not as\r\nthem without hope. Already--some days before the Order in Council--the\r\ndisappearance of Estrella's body, her daring prophecies, had led to the\r\nembarkation of 700 Jews for Palestine; and when the Regent's Edict gave\r\nstartling confirmation of her prediction of “the Return”, in many a\r\nmillion hearts thrilled the certainty: “the Day of the Lord is nigh!”\r\n\r\nAnd with that their stoicism and organizing strength, they mutely turned\r\nto follow the finger of Destiny: their _takifs_ (rich men), hard upon\r\nthe unchosen, were, as usual, liberal to their own, the fund swelled,\r\nand a Committee left England for the accumulation of stores and\r\nimplements; at the same time two Parliament Bills were passed in two\r\nsittings, empowering the purchase by Government of land “owned” by Jews\r\non Land Bill terms, and quickening the machinery for the collection of\r\ndebts due to Jews.\r\n\r\nWhereupon, “You see”, said the Chief Rabbi, “he drives us out: but he\r\nmakes us aprons--if only of fig-leaves--to cover us. Let us bow to his\r\nrod, and thank him, and go: he is God's Minister”.\r\n\r\nSo they went: the world's mercantile marine having been summoned,\r\nsea-ports were turned into caravansaries of gabardine and ear-lock: the\r\nExodus began.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of which it came to the knowledge of the Regent that the\r\nhouse of Frankl was making ready for departure.\r\n\r\nAnd now Hogarth rebelled against Heaven: self-forgetfully he did his\r\nbest, and it returned and struck him dead: for what good, he thought,\r\nwould his life do him, she always in Asia, he in Europe?\r\n\r\nHe wrote to her, a passionate hotch-potch of command and grovelling\r\nsupplication: if she went, he would curse her; would go mad; would\r\nblaspheme God; would throw up everything; would die.\r\n\r\nHe had promised to go down to Oxford to receive a degree, and as up to\r\nthe time of his departure she had not replied, he went half-unconscious\r\nof himself and those about him.\r\n\r\nNow, upon Adair Street the Expulsion had brought despair, the\r\nsecond-reading now assured, the Jews' vote over, and new writs issued;\r\nthe second-reading debate was actually in progress at that date of the\r\nOxford visit; and though the four yachts, copies of the _Mahomet II_,\r\nwere being rapidly put together, the Bill, if at all pressed, must get\r\nthrough before they could be ready; nor could the House of Lords long\r\ndelay its passage.\r\n\r\nThere remained Harris, so far ineffectual, but not therefore hopeless:\r\nso he, spurred, went down to Oxford.\r\n\r\nBut what Harris could not do was to get near to Hogarth: his task was,\r\nas it were, to pluck Venus from the firmament; but he mused, he mused\r\nupon her, with musing astrologic eye, with grand patience, fascinated\r\nby her very splendours, not without hope. When at 8 P.M. a banquet was\r\nserved to 250 guests in the Radcliffe Library, the upper gallery being\r\nopen to a crawling public to see the lions feed, Harris, watching thence\r\nthe unattainable under the blue of the canopy--blue always in honour of\r\nthe Sea--thought within himself: “Ah, Mr. 76, you've got it all, ain't\r\nyou?--for the time being. But 'ow'd you feel if I had a pistol now?\r\nGawd! I can just see him nicely curl and kick. Worse luck, I can't shoot\r\na bloomin' 'ouse”.\r\n\r\nBut the opportunity was so exquisite, that he resolved to try--the exit\r\nreached, would run, get a pistol, and return; but at the door itself\r\na hand touched his shoulder, and, with a twist of guilty scare, he\r\nsaw--O'Hara.\r\n\r\n“Good Gawd!” he whispered, “what you want to startle anybody like that\r\nfor? Don't you know that the wicked flea pursueth every man, but the\r\nrighteous shall escape his filthy snare?”\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here, boy?” asked O'Hara.\r\n\r\n“Thick-head! ain't I down 'ere after this precious Mr. 76?”--for\r\nHogarth, if Monarch of the Sun, would have remained for Harris only a\r\nglorified 76, Colmoor being for him the reality of the universe, all\r\nelse mirage, such stuff as dreams are made of.\r\n\r\n“Well”, said O'Hara, “come with me: want to talk to you”--he just come\r\nfrom the _Mahomet_ through Spain and France, drawn to Hogarth as moths\r\nto a candle, his petition for pardon not yet answered; and he assumed\r\nthat Hogarth's wrath still blazed, though, in fact, answer was only\r\ndelayed by competition of greater interests, Hogarth having forgotten\r\nO'Hara; at any rate, O'Hara, with shrinking qualms, had come to Oxford,\r\nthinking: “I will try and get at him for one more talk--I am not afraid\r\nof your eyes, my son: tut! I've seen the great brow in a prison-cap. And\r\nthe haughty beast still loves old Pat at bottom, I do declare. Be bold,\r\nbe bold, but not _too_ bold....Well, I will! And, if I perish, I perish,\r\nand he perishes, too, so help me, God”....\r\n\r\nAnd to Harris, walking by the towing-path, he said: “No, boy, don't you.\r\nNot now. Tut!--those lords: they are only making you their tool. Don't\r\nyou understand? Hogarth is robbing from them the land which they have\r\nrobbed from the British people, and they naturally wish to murder him:\r\nbut what have _you_, or I, to do with that? Let the thieves fight it out\r\nbetween them, while we enjoy ourselves, if we can. Weren't we happy in\r\nthe _Mahomet_, boy--we two? Didn't you roll whole weeks drunk? That was\r\nbetter than Colmoor, eh, Alfie? And didn't I have my incense, my grapes,\r\nmy little Circassian, and ten thousand pounds in yellow gold a\r\nyear? Wasn't that all right? Well, we may have it again!--not in the\r\n_Mahomet_, perhaps, but somewhere. Do nothing--not yet: till I give the\r\nword. If you _must_ kill, get a dog, or a horse, or an obscure old man,\r\nnot the Regent of England--”\r\n\r\n“Dirty old swine!” cried Harris, angry, “'aven't I forbid you again and\r\nagain from making game of me? You're doing it now! You just try that on,\r\nand go up thou bald-head, it _is_!”\r\n\r\n“But is this understood between us?”\r\n\r\n“Old duffer! you are one thing to-day, and another thing to-morrow:\r\nthere's no knowing how to tyke you. You're such a sinful old 'ypocrite,\r\nthat you play-act before yourself, I do believe. What is it you do mean?\r\nYou myke anyone sick of you; your incense and your burnt sacrifices are\r\nan offence unto me. This Mr. 76 once put a knife into me, and I mean to\r\nput another into him: 'ow's that?”\r\n\r\n“Not now!”\r\n\r\n“'Ow about your sweet friend, Frankl? I'm under contract with him, ain't\r\nI?”\r\n\r\n“Better put the knife into Frankl”.\r\n\r\n“Into the pair of you, it strikes me!”\r\n\r\n“Well, if you make the least attempt upon Hogarth now, you get not\r\nanother shilling--“.\r\n\r\n“Bah! shut that--!”\r\n\r\nBut the threat won sullen consent; and when after the Banquet the\r\nOxford guests had driven to see the illuminations, spoiled by boisterous\r\nSpring-winds, and when the Regent returned to his chambers, he caught\r\nsight of O'Hara amid the throng that lined the stair; upon which, after\r\nstepping up past, he stopped, twisted round, to say: “You, Admiral\r\nDonald?”\r\n\r\n“If I might speak ten minutes with your Lordship's Majesty--”\r\n\r\n“What about?”\r\n\r\nThose bold eyes of O'Hara dropped.\r\n\r\n“Well”, said the Regent, “I will see. Come to-morrow--about five,” and\r\nwent on up.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the Degree was conferred in the theatre, Doctor of\r\nCommon Law--“an appropriate one”, the Master of Balliol remarked,\r\n“though 'Surgeon' would perhaps be the _mot juste_”; and thus at last\r\nHogarth donned cap-and-tassel, though not Frankl's--a livery which drew\r\nfrom Harris the reflection: “Sweet beauty!--in his mortarboard”. The nip\r\nupon the brow of the college-cap peak resembled the nip of the Scotch\r\nprison-cap, awaking memories: but the symbolism was different.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the Regent's eye wandered, madness and folly in his heart, and\r\nfear, till at four a letter came, he having left Loveday at Buckingham\r\nPalace with instructions to open letters and send the One.\r\n\r\nShe had written:\r\n\r\n“What you can expect of me I am unable to conceive. Have you not\r\nexpelled me? Let us be worthy of our long friendship, and 'play the\r\nman'....'My exaltation to afflictions high'....With prayers for you, I\r\nsay good-bye: and will remember.\r\n\r\n“REBEKAH FRANKL”.\r\n\r\nLoveday had added: “She left London at noon for Southampton. Purchas\r\nfollowed to spy. Machray's other detective waits in Palace for\r\ninstructions”.\r\n\r\nAs to the dinner in Christ Church Hall, and the Ball, which were to end\r\nthe program of this last day, at four-thirty the news spread that the\r\nRegent had been taken ill.\r\n\r\n“Have you not expelled me?”...Was she angry? Did _she_ not know that he\r\nmeant well? Hogarth, breaking into a rage, leapt up, with, “I swear to\r\nGod that not one step does she move out of this country--!” and rushed\r\nto a bell: a gentleman-usher came.\r\n\r\n“What about going?”\r\n\r\n“All will be ready in fifteen minutes, my Lord King”.\r\n\r\n“I feel bad: say ten minutes; tell the Lord Chamberlain”.\r\n\r\n“Yes. I might mention--did your Lordship's Majesty grant a ten minutes'\r\naudience to Admiral Donald for this hour?”\r\n\r\n“_Who_? Yes, I think--Just kick him down the stairs! Or no--say I may\r\nsee him some day”.\r\n\r\nThis message, as the usher dashed through, was faithfully dropped at\r\nO'Hara's consciousness; and O'Hara said: “Hoity-toity...!”\r\n\r\nBent-backed he descended to the Quadrangle, with a sense of defeat,\r\nrebuff, contumely, rage, but quite sprightly said to Harris, waiting\r\nbeyond the Gateway: “Well, boy, how can we make a night of it? I feel\r\nthat way”.\r\n\r\n“Seen Mr. 76?”\r\n\r\n“Tut, no. Sharpen up that knife for his throat, boy!”\r\n\r\nAnd Harris exclaimed: “Another chynge! Strike me silly!--what did I\r\nsye? Give me a new 'eart, O Lawd, it _is_--you grey-haired old duffer.\r\nChopping and chynging, always the syme--to your old wife Jyne. I'd be\r\nashamed of myself in your plyce. But sharpen up the knife, it _is_”.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII\r\n\r\nTHE EMIGRANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLate the same night the Regent received at the Palace a telegram about\r\nRebekah: She had travelled alone to Southampton, where a landau at the\r\nstation had awaited her, in which she had driven to a country-house near\r\nthe Itchen named “Silverfern”, two miles from Bitterne Manor, in which\r\nlived an elderly gentleman, Mr. Abrahams, ark-opener and scroll-bearer\r\nin the Synagogue, with his wife and two sons. The passage of these, and\r\nof Rebekah, was booked by the _Calabria_, Jewish emigrant-ship, to sail\r\nin four days.\r\n\r\nHogarth no sooner heard these tidings than he tumbled into crime:\r\nresolved to kidnap Rebekah; to break his own law for his own behoof: one\r\nof the basest acts of a King.\r\n\r\nHe had four days: and by the end of the second four men lay in wait\r\nround “Silverfern”, one a sea-fort sub-lieutenant, one a detective, and\r\ntwo others very rough customers: a cottage having been hired by them for\r\nthe reception of Rebekah in a dell a mile higher up the Itchen.\r\n\r\nBut something infects the world; and gravity badgers the bullet's\r\ntrajectory; and a magnetic “H” disturbs the needle; and “impossible”\r\n roots turn up in the equation; and the finger of God is in every pie.\r\n\r\nHence, though the four ravishers lay in wait, and actually effected a\r\nseizure, the Regent did not get his girl.\r\n\r\nNone of the four had ever seen her: but as there was no young lady\r\nexcept her at “Silverfern”, that seemed of no importance, so she had\r\nbeen only described to them as dark and pretty.\r\n\r\nBut on the night after Rebekah's arrival, there came to “Silverfern” a\r\nnew inmate: Margaret Hogarth.\r\n\r\n_Her_ passage, too, was booked to Palestine.\r\n\r\nFor Frankl had said: “In expelling the Jews, he shall expel his own\r\nsister. Oh, that's sweet, after all!”\r\n\r\nAt this time Frankl's interest in Land Bill and England was dead, two\r\ninterests only remaining to him: so to realize his share in the Western\r\nworld as to reach Jerusalem loaded with wealth; and also, not less\r\nintense, to hurt Hogarth, to outwit him, to cry quits at the last.\r\n\r\nIt was hard--Hogarth being set so high; but he invoked the help of the\r\nHoly One (blessed be He): and was not without resource.\r\n\r\nWhy had Hogarth never had him seized, racked? What restrained the Regent\r\n_now_? That was a question with Frankl. Hogarth might say, even to\r\nhimself, that Frankl was vermin too small to be crushed, that he waited\r\nfor his sister from God; but lately the real reason had grown upon\r\nFrankl: it was because Hogarth _was afraid_ of him! afraid that Frankl,\r\nif persecuted beyond measure, might blurt out the Regent's convict past,\r\nand raise a sensation of horror through the world not pleasant to face.\r\nHarris, O'Hara, Rebekah and Frankl alone knew that past, and the motives\r\nfor silence of the first three were obvious; nor had Frankl whispered\r\nthat secret even to his own heart in his bed-chamber, conscious of his\r\nown guilt in the matter of the Arab Jew's death, fearing that, if the\r\nwit and power of Hogarth were given motive to move heaven and earth, the\r\nreal facts might not be undiscoverable: then would Frankl be ground\r\nto fine powder by the grinders. But if he was going to Palestine, what\r\nmattered?\r\n\r\nAlso, there was Margaret: she should go out as a Jewess.\r\n\r\nShe arrived at “Silverfern” in the charge of a Jewish clerk, and the\r\nAbrahams received her as an afflicted orphan, committed to Frankl by her\r\nfather; she, like Rebekah, to go under their care.\r\n\r\nWell, the evening before the departure, Mr. and Mrs. Abrahams, their\r\ntwo sons, Rebekah and Margaret, all go for a stroll--about nine o'clock,\r\nthat morning one of the four ravishers having been to the house on some\r\npretence, seen Margaret with Mrs. Abrahams under the porch, and noted\r\nher well, her grey tailor-gown, her brooch, her singing; and now, as all\r\nwalked out under the moon, they were watched, the watchers, surprised\r\nat the presence of _two_ young ladies, concluding that the\r\nsmaller--Rebekah--must have arrived later: so upon the large and shapely\r\nform of Margaret their gaze fastened, as the party passed near their\r\nhedge of concealment, Margaret then remarking: “My name is Rachel\r\nOppenheimer--” and Mrs. Abrahams with gentle chiding answering her: “No,\r\nbe good: your name is Ruth Levi”.\r\n\r\nFor during two years at the Jewish Asylum at Wroxham they had\r\ntilled into her shrieking brain, “Now, be good: your name is\r\nRachel Oppenheimer”, and one day she had said: “My name _is_ Rachel\r\nOppenheimer”, and had been saying it ever since.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there was a real Rachel Oppenheimer, a dependent of Frankl's,\r\nat Yarmouth, who was rather mad, and when it had been necessary\r\nthat Margaret should be out of the way in order to secure Hogarth's\r\nconviction, two doctors had examined this Rachel Oppenheimer, and given\r\nthe legal certificates by means of which Frankl had put away Margaret;\r\nand she during two years of sanity in an atmosphere of lunacy had\r\nscreamed for pity, till one morning she had shewed the stare, the\r\nunworldly rapture, and had started to sing her old songs.\r\n\r\nAfter which, Frankl, hearing of it, and touched by some awe, had got her\r\nout, and kept her in one retreat or another.\r\n\r\nBut in all her madness was mixed some memory of his devilish heart, and\r\nevery fresh sight of him inspired her with panic, she in his presence\r\nhanging upon his eyes, instant to obey his slightest hint: hence her\r\nbeckoning down to Hogarth from that window in Market Street.\r\n\r\nNow, on this last night of England the Abrahams party strolled far, two\r\ndays like Summer days having come, on hedge and tree now tripping\r\nthe shoots of Spring, the moon-haunted night of a mild mood: so from\r\n“Silverfern” lawns they passed up a steep field northward, down a path\r\nbetween village-houses, and idled within a pine-wood by the river-side.\r\n\r\nThe moon's glow was like one luminous ghost: and buttercup, daisy,\r\nsnowdrop, primrose gathered Margaret, vagrant, flighty, light to the\r\nwinds that wafted her as fluff, and tossed them suddenly aloft, and\r\nback they came to be tangled in her bare hair; and now she was a tipsy\r\nbacchante, singing:\r\n\r\n  “Will you come to the wedding?\r\n  Will you come?\r\n  Bring you own bread and butter,\r\n  And your own tea and sugar,\r\n  And we'll all pay a penny for the Rum”.\r\n\r\n“Poor Ruth!”--from Rebekah, an arm about her waist.\r\n\r\n“There is such a huge pool which is wheeling”, said Margaret, gazing\r\nat it with surprise, “and it goes hollow in the middle: my goodness,\r\nit does wheel! and there is a little grey duck in it ranging round and\r\nround with it, and this little grey duck is singing like an angel”.\r\n\r\n“Do you know where we are going to?” asked Rebekah: “to the land of our\r\nfathers, Ruth, after all the exile in this ugly Western world; and it is\r\nhe who sends us, the fierce-willed master of men”.\r\n\r\n“My name”, said Margaret, “is Rachel Oppenheimer”; and immediately,\r\nwafted like a half-inflated balloon which leaps to descend a thousand\r\nfeet away, she sang:\r\n\r\n  “Happy day! Happy day!\r\n  When Jesus washed my sins away...”\r\n\r\nThen, woe-begone, she shook her head, and let fall her abandoned hand;\r\nand Rebekah, speaking more to herself: “Did you never hear of Hogarth,\r\nthe King, Ruth? or see him in some dream in shining white, with a face\r\nlike the face in the bush which burned and was not consumed?”\r\n\r\nBut now Margaret laughed, crying out: “Oh, there's a man riding a\r\nshorthorn bull that has wings; white it is: and up they fly, the\r\nbull pawing and snorting, all among the stars. Oh, and now the man is\r\nfalling!--my goodness--”\r\n\r\nShe stood still, gazing at that thing in heaven.\r\n\r\n“Well, what has become of the man, dear?” asked Rebekah.\r\n\r\n“I can't make out....But I should like to marry that man”.\r\n\r\n“Ah, if wishes were fathers, we should all have babies, Ruth, to say our\r\n_kaddish_”.\r\n\r\n“Oh, look--!” cried Margaret.\r\n\r\nA rabbit had rushed across a path ahead, and she ran that way beyond a\r\nbend....When Rebekah followed she had disappeared.\r\n\r\nOn Rebekah's outcry all set to search wood, path, river--she was gone;\r\nbut after five minutes a voice a long way off in the wood, singing:\r\n\r\n  “O what a pretty place,\r\n  And what a graceful city....”\r\n\r\non which the two youths flew toward the sound, and presently the rest,\r\nfollowing, heard a shout, a cry, then silence, till one of the young\r\nmen came running back, his face washed in blood: he had seen some forms,\r\nand, as he had approached, been struck on the brow, his brother felled.\r\nWhen all came to where the brother lay insensible, no sign of Margaret;\r\nnor could villagers and police, searching through the night, find her.\r\n\r\nShe had gone without surprise with her four captors, who had carried her\r\nto a cottage of boarded-up windows: and the same hour Hogarth had the\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the four received detailed instructions at the village\r\n_poste restante_: the lady-attendant at the cottage was to ask the\r\nprisoner if she would go to London, try to persuade her, and, if she\r\nconsented, make her sign pledge of honour (enclosed) to go without any\r\nattempt at escape during three days.\r\n\r\nThe men were surprised: for that Margaret was deranged they had seen at\r\nonce, and supposed that the Regent must know it: what, then, could her\r\npledge do? Their business, however, was to obey: and when Margaret\r\nwas asked: “Will you go quietly to the Palace in London with us?” she\r\nanswered: “Yes!” and sang:\r\n\r\n  “Here we go to London-town:\r\n  Tri-de-laddie! Tri-de-laddie!\r\n  See the King with his golden crown,\r\n   Tri-de-laddie, O!”\r\n\r\nBy noon the Abrahams and Rebekah were being tugged out of harbour, to\r\nthe hand-wavings and god-speeds of seven emigrant-boats by the quay; but\r\nit was not till five that the Regent's emissaries could obtain a special\r\ntrain on the thronged lines; and not till after seven did they arrive\r\nwith Margaret at the Palace-gates.\r\n\r\nNow, that night the Lord Regent and the Prince of Wales were attending\r\na banquet at the Guildhall, given in honour of sea-rent reduction on\r\nBritish ships, and at the moment when Margaret arrived Hogarth, already\r\n_en route_, thinking of Rebekah, muttered: “By now she is here!”\r\n\r\nBut since Frankl, on getting news of the disappearance of Margaret, had\r\nat once conjectured the hand of Hogarth, as Margaret was being handed\r\nfrom the cab at the Palace-gates, she saw two terrible eyes, and,\r\nsnatching her hand free, flew screaming down the street--eyes of Frankl,\r\nwho, conjecturing that hither she would be brought, had taken stand\r\nthere half the afternoon, knowing precisely the effect upon her of\r\nthe sight of his face; and said he: “You see, you haven't got her\r\nyet--though you _shall_ have her to your heart's content....”\r\n\r\nAs she could only run southward or northward, he had posted two\r\nmotor-cars, one containing a clerk to south, the other Harris, to north,\r\nso that, as she ran, one or other should catch her, hustle her in, and\r\ndash away.\r\n\r\nIn fact, she ran north, right into the arms of Harris, her surprised\r\nguardians still ten yards behind; and “Quick!” hissed Harris, “come with\r\nme, or 'e'll 'ave you!” and was off with her.\r\n\r\nUpon which Frankl drove to the Market Street house, where he found\r\nHarris and Margaret; and again, with screams, she sought to fly, though\r\nher first terrors gave place to a quiet subservience after some minutes\r\nof his presence.\r\n\r\n“Oh Lawd!” said Harris, “she started singing in the car, you know. Sing\r\nme songs of Araby, it _is_. Enough to give anybody the sicks”.\r\n\r\n“You see this gentleman here?” said Frankl to Margaret.\r\n\r\n“Yes”, she whispered: “oh my!”\r\n\r\n“Well, it so happens that very likely you are going to live in the same\r\nhouse as him--a big Palace with all gold and silver, where the King with\r\nhis crown lives, and all. So while you are there, I want you to be his\r\nfriend as if it was myself, and do everything he tells you, same as\r\nmyself, in fact. Do you see?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”, she whispered, her large form towering above Frankl's, yet awe of\r\nhim widening her eyes.\r\n\r\n“What's your name?” said he.\r\n\r\n“My name is Rachel Oppenheimer”, said she.\r\n\r\n“All right: come up and dress”.\r\n\r\nShe followed him up to a back room, where was a lamp, a glass, etc., and\r\non an old settee evening-dress complete, shoes, roses, head-wrap.\r\n\r\n“Now”, said Frankl, leaving her, he, too, in evening-dress, “I give\r\nyou ten minutes to rig yourself out in that lot: a second more, and you\r\ncatch it”.\r\n\r\nAnd in fifteen minutes they two were in a cab, _en route_ for the\r\nGuildhall, Frankl, who had invitations for himself and daughter, saying:\r\n“You understand? you keep your eye fixed upon me the whole time--never\r\nmind about eating--and when I hold up my finger _so_, you rise and give\r\nthem a little song....”\r\n\r\nIt was a function intended to be memorable, the Lord Regent going\r\nin state, attended by 150 Yeomen, King-at-Arms, six heralds and all\r\nHeralds' College, to be met at Temple Bar by my Lord Mayor, that\r\nday made a baronet, with his Sheriffs and Aldermen on horseback; the\r\nGuildhall in blue velvet, the platform at the east end bearing rows\r\nof squat gold chairs, while a canopy of deep-blue velvet, lined with\r\nlight-blue sarcenet, dropped ponderous draperies, tied back with gold\r\nropes, over the floor; on the canopy-front being Sword and Sceptre, the\r\nRoyal Crown of Britain, and the Diadem of the Sea; the canopy table and\r\nthe other looking like a short and a long wine-banquet of the Magi in\r\nOphir: present being members of the British Royal House, Ambassadors\r\nto Britain and the Sea, the two Archbishops, Ministers, the Speaker,\r\nOfficers, Fort-Admirals, the Regent's Household, the chief Nobility, the\r\nCity personages.\r\n\r\nFarthest from the short royal table, near the foot of the long, where\r\nthe dishes were _kosher_ for a Jewish colony, sat Frankl, and opposite\r\nhim Margaret; and that face of Frankl was pinched and worn.\r\n\r\nHe prayed continually: “May God be my Rock and my High Tower; may the\r\nAlmighty be my Shield this night....” while in two minutes Margaret had\r\nbegun to be a wonder to her neighbours--heaved sighs, threw herself,\r\nbeat plate with knife, hummed a little, yet conscious of wrong-doing,\r\nher eyes fixed upon Frankl.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my!” her sigh heaved mortally, head tumbling dead on shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Are you--unwell?” asked a startled neighbour, all shirt-front,\r\neye-glass and delicacy.\r\n\r\n“I see a long table with gold plates”, she whined pitifully, “on every\r\nplate an eyeball dying....”\r\n\r\nFrankl controlled her with a glance of anger.\r\n\r\nAnd in the second course after turtle, with a fainting prayer to\r\nJehovah, the Jew clandestinely held up a forefinger; upon which she,\r\nafter some hesitation, remembered the signal, and like a dart shot to\r\nher feet.\r\n\r\nNow every eye fastened upon her, from Regent's and Prince's to\r\nthe bottom, those near her, who knew her now, feeling a miserable\r\nheart-shrinking of shame.\r\n\r\nWith sideward head she stood some seconds, smiling; and she sighed: “My\r\nname is Rachel--”\r\n\r\nBut soon, her mood now rushing into sprightliness, she stamped, and with\r\nan active alacrity of eye, sang:\r\n\r\n  “Will you come to the wedding?\r\n  Will you come?\r\n  Bring your own bread-and-butter,\r\n  And your own tea-and-sugar,\r\n  And we'll all pay a penny for the Rum,\r\n  Rum, Rum,\r\n  We'll all pay a penny for the Rum”.\r\n\r\nThe Regent had risen, while Frankl, calm now in reaction, gazed sweetly\r\nupon his face: the vengeance of a Jew--nor was he half done with\r\nvengeance. Certainly, Hogarth was pale: he had sought her long, and\r\nfound her _so_. “Why it is my own heart”, he thought, “and they have\r\nmade her mad”.\r\n\r\nOne moment a stab of shame pierced him at the reflection: “_Here!_” but\r\nin the next his heart yearned upon her, and he rose nimbly and naturally\r\nfar beyond Lord Mayor and Prince, and the rut of the world. After a\r\nperfectly deliberate bow, he left his place, and walked down the length\r\nof the hall to her, amid the gaping gods, Loveday, too, and three\r\nothers, when he was half-way, following.\r\n\r\nHe had her hand, touched her temple lightly, yet compellingly,\r\nhealingly....\r\n\r\n“Dear, don't you know me?--Richard?--_Dick?_”\r\n\r\nNo, but at sight of Loveday some kind of recognition seemed to light,\r\nand die, in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Will you come, dear, and sit up yonder with me?” Hogarth asked, his\r\nface a mask of emotion.\r\n\r\nWearily she shook her head; and “John”, said Hogarth, “take her home”;\r\nwhereupon Loveday led her out, the Regent returning to the canopy.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour later he found it _à propos_ of something to say to the\r\nPrince: “That lady who sang is my sister, Your Royal Highness--seems to\r\nhave been subjected to gross cruelties, and has gone crazy”.\r\n\r\nThe next morning everyone knew that she was the Regent's sister; and a\r\nman said to a man: “There is madness in the family, then....”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SEA-FORTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second-reading of the Land Bill had passed by a 59 majority: and it\r\nwould now have been easy work to hurry through its remaining stages in a\r\ncouple of weeks; but the Regent had awaited the nation's verdict in the\r\nreturn of the 120 to fill the Jewish seats, sure of the result.\r\n\r\nSo the 23rd was a great night--the third-reading--the majority 115 at 8\r\nP.M.; and the next day, which was marked by a very brilliant levée, the\r\nBill was before the Lords.\r\n\r\nThis stage it might easily have reached four weeks before, but had been\r\nshelved for the election of the 120: and in those weeks the four copies\r\nof the _Mahomet II_. had been launched.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly--bad news from Palestine: news that there, too, after all\r\nthe safeguards, the greed of a few was working to plant the old\r\nEuropean wrong: for, the Sanhedrim being short of funds for a railway, a\r\nsyndicate of five merchant-princes had offered to buy from it an estate\r\nbetween Jerusalem and the Jordan, and when the Chief Rabbi had pointed\r\nout that the offer was monstrous, in view of the terms of the Sea's\r\nDeed of Gift, a fierce discussion had ensued, a schism; and although\r\nthe syndicate's offer had been rejected by 27, at the next session\r\nthe defeated leader, like some warlike Maccabæus, had surged with his\r\nfaction and a hundred Arabs into the Mosque of Omar where the Sanhedrim\r\nmet, to cast those who did not escape by flight into prison in the\r\nPasha's Palace. In the hands of his clique the Government remained.\r\n\r\nSuch was the news....\r\n\r\nIt was followed in three days by a Representation to the Regent, signed\r\nby 90,000 Jews in Palestine, the fourth name being Rebekah Frankl's,\r\nthey imploring him for their sinking ship just launched, calling him\r\n“Father”.\r\n\r\nFor though the Jews had been content to see that Europe which they\r\ncontemned parcelled out among a few, while the mass of men hovered\r\ncountryless--from this had arisen their lucre--their mental quality was\r\ntoo rich in business shrewdness to tolerate in their own case any such\r\nBedlam: yet they stood helpless before the disaster, and only in the\r\nRegent was hope.\r\n\r\nOn that night of the arrival of their Petition, the Prime Minister and\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief dined in the Palace, placid men at the moment\r\nwhen soup began, the Regent's sky quite clear, for, though a rumour\r\nwhispered that the Lords were designedly lengthening discussion of the\r\nBill, this gave no one any concern.\r\n\r\nDuring entremêts, however, a scribbled card was passed into the hand of\r\nthe Commander-in-Chief, and, as he read, his eyebrows lifted. Craving\r\npermission, he hurried out, had some talk with his Director of Military\r\nIntelligence, and returned pale.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, as they three sat on a balcony overlooking the lake, with\r\ncigars, the Regent said: “I have thought, Sir Robert Wortley, of sending\r\nout at once two thousand Tommies under, say, General Sir John Clough, to\r\nthe help of those poor Jews....”\r\n\r\nHere the Commander-in-Chief cleared his throat, and in a strained voice\r\ninterfered: “That is, my Lord King, if we ourselves have not need of\r\nevery soldier of the line within the next week”.\r\n\r\nThe Regent deposited his ash with peering eyes, puzzled.\r\n\r\n“What does your Lordship mean?”\r\n\r\n“Your Lordship's Majesty, I was summoned from dinner just now to talk\r\nwith Major-General Sir Maurice Coppleston, who reports movements of\r\narmed men, just come to his knowledge, and now going forward on a\r\nconsiderable scale, all northward. He gathers that these can only\r\nconsist of Territorials and Yeomanry Cavalry, of whom not less than\r\ntwelve battalions of rifles and three batteries of artillery, officers\r\nand men, are now on the way to, or massed upon, York. How widely the\r\nmovement may actually extend--God knows”.\r\n\r\nSilence now: Sir Robert Wortley suddenly whitening to the lips. Then\r\nHogarth, in a very low voice, said: “They do not know me”.\r\n\r\n“If I may crave leave to retire at once--” from the Commander-in-Chief;\r\nand Hogarth gave consent.\r\n\r\nQueer things, omens, doubtings, weird clouds, gathered about Hogarth\r\nthat night. When at eleven he gave audience to Admiral Quilter-Beckett,\r\narrived from the _Boodah_ Quilter-Beckett said: “Strange the fine\r\nweather here: at sea it is quite rough, the _Boodah_ well under foam,\r\nand that old _Campania_ pitches so--”\r\n\r\n“You have come, then, in the _Campania_?”--from Hogarth.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my Lord King”.\r\n\r\n“And what about the yacht?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, the yacht: in her I have sent the two hundred men to the\r\n_Mahomet_”.\r\n\r\n“_Which_ two hundred men, Admiral?”\r\n\r\nQuilter-Beckett stared.\r\n\r\n“Your Lordship's Majesty has forgotten: I had instructions that you\r\ndesired some interchanges among the garrisons, and had ordered the\r\nsending of two hundred of my men to the _Mahomet_, I to receive in\r\nreturn two hundred from her”.\r\n\r\n“And you have sent your two hundred?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my Lord King”.\r\n\r\n“Have you received the two hundred from the _Mahomet?_”\r\n\r\n“They had not arrived when I left the _Boodah_”.\r\n\r\n“So that you left only one hundred men in the _Boodah_, with\r\ninstructions to receive two hundred others?”\r\n\r\n“That is so, my Lord King”.\r\n\r\nThere was silence.\r\n\r\n“But suppose I tell you that I have given no such instructions: will\r\nyour heart--_leap?_”\r\n\r\nHogarth clapped a sudden hand of horror upon Quilter-Beckett's shoulder.\r\n\r\n“My God--!” Quilter-Beckett started like a gun's recoil.\r\n\r\n“Be calm, Admiral: it may be only some mistake....From whence had you\r\nthis order?”\r\n\r\n“From--from the _Mahomet_, in the usual course--”\r\n\r\n“Good night, Admiral; I would be alone”.\r\n\r\nAt that very hour a world-tragedy was being enacted over the dark and\r\nturbulent ocean, and the immensest of Empires was sinking into the sea.\r\n\r\nDarkly, quietly, with no mighty and multitudinous tumult of man.\r\n\r\nThat midnight the night-glass of many a mystified merchantman searched\r\nthe murk for those coruscations with which the crescent of forts had\r\nconstellated the Atlantic, the mariner's sea-rent waiting ready, with\r\nhis ship's-papers, in his cash box: but no galaxy of lights glanced that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nTo some, before this, they had appeared, but, as the ship approached,\r\nhad vanished, and it was as though the swarm of the Pleiades had\r\nbeen caught from the skies before their eyes. Long before dawn ships\r\nseparated by three thousand miles had gained the assurance that this\r\nor that sea-fort no longer rode the familiar spot-had been rapt to the\r\nstars, had sunk, had somehow passed from being. Before this monstrous\r\nmarvel the mariner stood dumb, and it was afterwards said that that wild\r\nnight the terminals of heaven and earth were lost, that the storm-winds\r\nwere haunted, in all the air lamentation, sobbings as for swallowed\r\norbs, and the whisper: “It is finished”.\r\n\r\nTwo days previously a telegram from Admiral O'Hara had gone to all the\r\nforts in European waters, commanding an interchange of 200 of their men\r\nwith men of his own fort; and each officer in command, ignorant that the\r\nsame instructions had gone to others, had complied: so that by the next\r\nmorning, the 29th April, 1600 men from eight forts were converging in\r\nyachts upon the _Mahomet_. As the fort garrisons, originally numbering\r\n500, had recently been reduced to 300, the others having been mostly\r\ndrafted into the 2nd Division of the British Royal Marines, compliance\r\nwith Admiral O'Hara's order left a garrison of 100 only at each of eight\r\nforts.\r\n\r\nToward five in the afternoon of that day, the 29th, 700 men, to\r\nthe bewilderment of her officers, were in the _Mahomet_ two of the\r\nfort-yachts having arrived upon a troubled First Lieutenant who was\r\nin command, all attempts to see the Admiral since the morning having\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nBut near seven the Admiral summoned the Treasurer to his _bureau_ near\r\nthe bottom, he being in dressing-gown and slippers, very slovenly,\r\nseeming either drunk or sick, his mouth gaping to his pantings, and anon\r\nhis languishing eye shot dyingly to heaven.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see how I am, Mr. Treasurer”, he went, “seedy. Pain in this\r\ntemple, trouble with the respiration, and a foul breath. Poor Admiral\r\nDonald, Mr. Treasurer, poor Admiral Donald. The fashion of this world\r\npasseth away, sir, and the Will of God be done! Sometimes, I pledge you\r\nmy word, I almost wish that I was dead. There are things, sir, in this\r\nworld--Ah, well, God help me; I feel very chippy. I wanted to ask you,\r\nsir, to let me see the books, and hand me over at once all unaudited and\r\nunsettled funds in your counting-house, though I'm not fit for affairs\r\nto-day, sir, God knows--”\r\n\r\n“Sir!” cried the Treasurer, a hard-browed, bald-headed man with a\r\nfan-beard, savouring of banks and ledgers.\r\n\r\n“Just pass them over, sir”.\r\n\r\n“Well, this is the most singular order I ever heard of!”\r\n\r\n“Obey me promptly, sir, or, by God, I cashier you!” roared O'Hara, his\r\nraised lids laying nude the debauchery of those jaundiced juicy balls.\r\n\r\n“Be it so, Admiral Donald”--the Treasurer bowed: “but on the\r\nunderstanding that I formally protest against the irregularity, and\r\nreport it to the High Chancellor”.\r\n\r\nHe retired, and in half an hour returned with two clerks who bore books,\r\nhimself a carpet-bag containing in cash-boxes £850,000, paper and\r\ngold, which he deposited on the Admiral's _bureau_, and, after again\r\nprotesting before the clerks, went away.\r\n\r\nNot far off by now were some of the other six fort-yachts, converging\r\nwith their 200 upon the _Mahomet_, and as the Admiral had no intention\r\nof being put into irons as a lunatic in his own fort, at eight o'clock\r\nhe stole from his apartments, dressed now, not in uniform, but in\r\npriest's robes and a voluminous cloak, bearing in one hand the bag, in\r\nthe other a key.\r\n\r\nThose lower depths of the _Mahomet_ were an utter solitude, lit with\r\nrare rays; yet the Admiral journeyed through and up peering, skulking,\r\npausing, hurrying, and, if by chance a light caught his face, it showed\r\na horror of convulsive flesh, his body a mass of trembling, like jelly.\r\n\r\nNow, the forts had been built to fight; and (since nothing is\r\nimpossible), if they fought, they might fall into an enemy's hand: to\r\nobviate which, there was in a little room on the third floor a handle\r\nwhich opened by hydraulics a door in the fort's side on the fifth floor\r\nbelow, the existence of this room being unknown save to each Admiral and\r\nto four of his lieutenants, and its key kept in a spot known to these.\r\nThis key O'Hara now had in hand; and as he pushed it into the lock, his\r\njaw jabbered like a baboon's.\r\n\r\nNight was now come; the sea rough; Spain lost to sight; the two emptied\r\nyachts on the way back to their forts; yonder the lights of the _Mahomet\r\nII_. lying-to; two officers in oilskins walking arm in arm, to and fro,\r\non the roof; and said one: “Look at those waves there all of a sudden:\r\nthey rather seem to be breaking on the wrong side of us”.\r\n\r\nThen they resumed their talk; and to and fro they walked, arm in arm.\r\n\r\nTill now one with sudden hiss: “But-good Christ-just look-why, the\r\nroof's _leaning_--!”\r\n\r\nAt that moment an outcry and runners from below, shouts, a trumpet-call,\r\nwere borne on the winds to them: for the Admiral had rushed up to the\r\nmanned parts of the fort, all hell alight in his eyeballs, bawling out,\r\n“The boats! The _Mahomet_ is sinking!”\r\n\r\nIn spite of which many perished, the survivors afterwards declaring\r\nthat the tragedy mesmerized their nerves with a certain awe not to be\r\ncompared with the terrors felt on sinking ships, the _Mahomet_ affecting\r\nthem like a being of life, like behemoth slowly dying, or some doomed\r\nmoon. She gave them, indeed, plenty of time, though when the steel\r\nportals on two of her sides were opened, the sea washed up the steps,\r\nmaking the launching very delicate feats, and near the last the leaning\r\nwas so marked, that there was difficulty in standing; and still in\r\npatient distress she waited while the waves like multitudinous wolves,\r\ntrooped to prey upon her.\r\n\r\nAs the Admiral ran to the outer Collector's Office to embark, he was\r\nfaced by the Treasurer, revolver in hand, and “Hand me over that bag,\r\nAdmiral”, he said pretty coolly, “or I blow out your brains”.\r\n\r\nO'Hara's mouth worked: he could not speak.\r\n\r\n“Will you?” said the Treasurer: “no doubt you mean to hand it over to\r\nthe proper authorities, but I prefer to do that myself. Be quick, you\r\nold dog!”\r\n\r\nWhereat O'Hara, having no weapon, dropped the bag, and trotted wide-eyed\r\nforward to the thronged scene of the launchings.\r\n\r\nThere were more than enough boats, and though on the lowest side of the\r\nfort nothing could long be done, all had gone off, when the fort, having\r\nsettled very low, looking for some time like a brawling cauldron and\r\narea of breaking waves coloured by her hundred lights, went down, and\r\nwas not.\r\n\r\nWhereupon the yacht, over a hundred yards away, was caught in the\r\ntraction of her strong enthralment, and, like a planet, started into\r\nrunning round a region of sea which wheeled; while seven of the boats,\r\nrowing for life, were grasped, and dragged back, with a hundred and\r\nnine, into the deep.\r\n\r\n“Toll for the brave....”\r\n\r\nAs to the other boats, they arrived at Tarifa the following evening,\r\nwith 583; but the Admiral ordered the _Mahomet II_. to Cadiz, where soon\r\nafter midnight he landed, and, by negotiation with a “_Jefe_”, in an\r\nhour had a train for Madrid. As he was about to step in, the Treasurer\r\ntouched his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“What, Admiral, off by land?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, as you know”, said O'Hara, “for you have been spying my\r\nmovements for the last hour. How childish to imagine that I have\r\nanything to fear, or want to escape! Why, I am bound for England--my\r\nonly object in the land journey being quickness. I even invite you to\r\ncome with me.”\r\n\r\n“All right, Admiral, I will....If you be tempted to murder me _en\r\nroute_, remember these”--a pair of pistols; and they set out at about\r\nthe hour when the whole crescent of tragedies was over.\r\n\r\nAt six that evening a yacht, a copy of the _Mahomet II_., had come to\r\nthe Cattegat sea-fort to land 200 men who wore the Empire's blue-jacket,\r\nthe name “Mahomet” on their caps--nothing to show that they were not\r\ngenuine Mahomet men, though some looked rather sea-sick; but in\r\nreality they were young lords, stock-brokers, Territorial Officers,\r\nmen-about-town, park-keepers, undergraduates, secretly armed with knife\r\nand revolver, and knowing, too, where the armoury of the sea-fort lay.\r\n\r\nMeantime, three other yachts, all named _Mahomet II_., were a-ply in the\r\nAtlantic, two containing 400 men each, one 600, each of the first two\r\nto land 200 at a fort at six, and her remaining 200 at the next fort by\r\neight-thirty, serving four forts, the last to land 200 at each of\r\nthree forts: so that by 10.30 P.M. each of eight forts, including the\r\nCattegat, contained 200 enemies disguised as fort-men.\r\n\r\nAnd punctually at eleven, in each, began perhaps the darkest massacre of\r\nhistory--no quarter given--and when the alarm went forth, whichever of\r\nthe unarmed fort-men rushed to the dark armoury found the door fastened\r\nagainst him. Of two men in bed, talking together through an open door,\r\none arose at the stroke of a clock and killed the other; some perished\r\nin sleep--all very quietly accomplished: a few shots, a few lost echoes\r\nin the vast castles, a few daubs of blood. And in no case did a single\r\none, either massacred or assassin, escape alive: for, in every\r\ncase, some one or other of the fort-officers--Admiral, Lieutenant,\r\nCommander--to prevent capture, opened the inlet to the flood in the very\r\nthick of the doom, went down with his muteness and his bubbling, and the\r\nsea, a secret in its bosom, rolled over the Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX\r\n\r\nTHE DÉBÂCLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAll the next day, till near 9 P.M., not one syllable was definitely\r\nknown of this tremendous fact by anyone in Britain: for though, early\r\nastir, the Regent telegraphed the _Mahomet_, all day he waited without\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nAt eleven the Prime Minister said to him: “Things, my Lord King, wear\r\nat this moment an aspect so threatening, that I see no escape from civil\r\nwar, even if it be brief, except by the immediate forcing through of the\r\nBill, and I stand ready--now--to propose you as new peers--”\r\n\r\n“Wait”, answered the Regent: “pass to-night the Bill should, but I think\r\nI shall effect that by myself going to the Lords, and listening a little\r\nto the talk”.\r\n\r\nA dark day, with an under-thought always, whatever the business, of one\r\nthing--the Sea....\r\n\r\nAbout 5.30, as was his custom, he went up a stair to pass along two\r\ncorridors to the little cream suite in which lived Margaret, for whom\r\nthe doctors now promised sanity, her forehead daily seeming to drink-in\r\npeace from the contact of his palm, after which she would comb his hair,\r\nhe lying on a sofa, or taking tea; and, “Well, dear”, he said, this last\r\nday of all, as her ladies retired to an inner salon, “how is the head?”\r\n\r\n“I have seen you before”, she replied: “what is your name?”\r\n\r\n“Dick Hogarth. Come to me, and let me lay my heavy head on you. The\r\nheart of your friend bodes to-day, bodes, bodes; but is not afraid: a\r\ntough heart, Madge. Do you like me to press my hand upon your head like\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\nThen, weary of his moaning heart that moaned that day like choruses\r\nof haunted winds through desolate halls, he fell to sleep even as he\r\nmumbled to her, she, seated near his sofa, playing with his hair, his\r\narm around her, faint zephyrs from the window fanning his head, waving\r\ndown the valenciennes.\r\n\r\nBut now she tossed the comb away, hummed, became restless, disengaged\r\nher shoulders, rose, strayed listlessly, with sighs, and on finding\r\nherself in the ante-chamber, opened the door, went out into a corridor,\r\nleant her back, eyeing the floor; and next with a great sigh set to\r\ngazing upward, droning two notes, one _doh_, one _soh_. All was silent.\r\nBut now a sound of voices that drew her, she moving into another longer\r\ncorridor, with balusters which overlooked a hall below, and yonder at\r\nthe stair-foot were two men in altercation, one a guard, to whom the\r\nother was saying “But I tell you the lydy herself arst me to go to her;\r\nit's an appointment, just like any other appointment. Do let a fellow\r\npass!” and with mouth at ear he added: “_It's an affair of the 'eart!\r\n'Ere's a sov--_”\r\n\r\n“Couldn't, my friend, couldn't”, the guardsman said.\r\n\r\nBut now Harris: “Why, there she is 'erself, so 'elp-! come out to meet\r\nme, as the Lord liveth!”--ran then toward where she looked over to send\r\nup the hoarse whisper: “I sye--didn't you tell me yourself to come--?”\r\n\r\nOn which she nodded amiably, smiling, touching a rose in her bosom.\r\n\r\n“There you are! What more do you want?” he said to the guard, who now\r\ngave him passage: and like a dart he darted, like a freed lark, or\r\nunleashed hound, fleet on the feet, with lifted brow.\r\n\r\n“I sye!” he whispered her, all active, brisk as a cat,\r\necstatic--“where's 'e?”\r\n\r\n“Who?”--she still at her rose, a memory straying in her that here was a\r\nfriend, whom the Terrible One had bid her obey.\r\n\r\n“Mr.--the Regent”, he whispered.\r\n\r\n“I don't know him. What is your name? _My_ name is--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you muddle-headed cat! Don't you know the dark man with the black\r\nmoles--quick!”\r\n\r\n“_Sh-h-h_--he is sleeping”.\r\n\r\n“Gawd! is he though? Come, show me! I've got a old appointment--”\r\n\r\nShe led the way: the two corridors--the door--the room, he treading on\r\nair, brow up, eyes on fire, knife bright and ready; and eight feet from\r\nthe couch she put out her forefinger, pointing, smiling, Hogarth's face\r\ntoward them, his mouth pouting in sleep, bosom breathing, a breeze in\r\nhis hair.\r\n\r\nFrom the lips of Harris, in the faintest snake-hiss, proceeded, “Sleep,\r\nmy little one-sleep, my pretty one--_sleep_--” and with a wrist as\r\ngraceful as the spring of a tigress he had the knife buried in Hogarth's\r\nleft breast.\r\n\r\nSome instinct must have pierced Hogarth's sleep an instant before the\r\nactual blow, for while the knife was yet in him he had Harris's wrist;\r\nand the assassin fled writhing, so brisk a trick had cracked his elbow.\r\n\r\nAnd blanched and short-breathed sprang Hogarth, but at once tottered,\r\nMargaret, open-mouthed, regarding him, till he suddenly cried out\r\n“Ladies!”, and before they came had hurried out, drawing his coat over\r\nthe place of blood.\r\n\r\nIn the second corridor he had to stop and lean, but then descended,\r\nstriking all whom he passed with awe at his face, till he stumbled into\r\nhis own drawing-room, and, as he fell, was caught by Sir Francis Yeames,\r\nthe Private Secretary.\r\n\r\nThe wound had passed along the outer front surface of the second rib\r\ntoward the scapula, injuring two of the branches of the axillary artery:\r\nso whispered the Resident Medical Attendant, while the council of\r\ndoctors pronounced the condition “very grave”, but not “dangerous”--a\r\ncase for “judicious pressure”; and after a long swoon he opened his\r\neyes; in the deeply-recessed series of windows, narrow and round-topped,\r\nnow dying the twilight; the insignificant bed lost in a chamber of\r\nfrescoes and vast darksome oils of battles and loves. And, suddenly\r\nstarting, he asked: “What's the time?”\r\n\r\n“Seven-thirty, my Lord King”, answered Sir Martin Phipps.\r\n\r\n“Ah, I remember: I was stabbed. Who did it?”\r\n\r\n“It can only be assumed from the evidence of a guardsman that it was a\r\nservant in the Palace, called Harris”.\r\n\r\n“Aye, I think I saw his face. Does anyone know of the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Very few persons so far....The police are after Harris”.\r\n\r\nNow the Regent started, understanding that the condemnation of Harris\r\nwould mean a revelation of the Colmoor-horror secret; and he said after\r\na minute, “John, is that you? Will you go and have the whole thing\r\nquashed?....And now, doctor, the wound.”\r\n\r\n“The wound is not what we call 'dangerous', my Lord King: ah, but\r\nbelieve me, it was a narrow shave”.\r\n\r\n“I dare say, Sir Martin: the outcomes of this particular world do arrive\r\nby narrow shaves; but they arrive, and life is an escape. At any rate,\r\ndoctor, I shall be able to go, as arranged, to the Lords--”\r\n\r\nThe doctor smiled. “No, never that”.\r\n\r\n“I shall go”.\r\n\r\nAnd at once he leapt from bed, staggering headlong in the effort, to\r\nstrike his head against a window corner, while all ran, crying out, to\r\ncatch him, the doctor thinking: “Those whom the gods destroy they first\r\ndrive mad”.\r\n\r\nSo far not a whisper of the stab had reached even the Prime Minister or\r\nthe Prince; but since the news of moving troops, and the reluctance of\r\nthe Lords to pass the Bill, agitated all, London came out to watch his\r\ndescent upon the Lords.\r\n\r\nHe went in precisely the spirit of a professor who steps to the chair,\r\nsmiles, and takes the class; but as he drove down Whitehall, this\r\nthought pierced him with a keener point than the steel of Harris: “_The\r\nSea...!_”\r\n\r\nHe did not know that at last a thousand transmitters, from Tarifa, from\r\nFrederikshavn, from many a ship, were thrilling the ether with messages\r\nas to the Sea.\r\n\r\nNor did he know that that day Frankl had whispered to some dozen people,\r\nwith proofs and old newspapers, that convict past of the Regent.\r\n\r\nAnd from his very first entering, when the Lord Chancellor rose, and\r\nthe Regent made the bow, he was shocked by the scene of open insolence\r\nspread before him.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the boldest eyes regarded him; he saw smiles of scorn,\r\nsnarling visages, as, with reclining head and lowered lids, his\r\neyes rested on the House: a hard gaze. Unfortunately, his pallor was\r\nperfectly obvious, and its significance, the stab being unknown, was\r\nmisunderstood.\r\n\r\nAnd up rose a young lord, who stammered unprofundities just below the\r\nregion of lawn-sleeves to the right; and another with slow step, as if\r\nto music, came up the gangway, and spoke at the table; and another after\r\nhim: and it needed sustained effort to understand what they said; the\r\nbrain, as it were, would not close upon statement after statement so\r\ninsignificant. But Hogarth would have endured till midnight, or\r\nlonger, but for a growing doubt within him: “Am I bleeding? Shall I not\r\ncertainly faint?”\r\n\r\nAnd there was this other question: “To what greater daring of insolence\r\nwill these impossible speeches rise?”\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at five minutes to ten, in the very midst of a duke's speech,\r\nthe Regent, with dizzy brain, was on his feet: there was a few moments'\r\ngasp and breathlessness; and then--all at once--it was as though a wind\r\nfrom hell swept through that House, whirling in its vehemence Regent,\r\nlords, Gallery, Black Rod, Clerk, Usher, and all; and every face was\r\nmarble, and every eye a blaze.\r\n\r\nThe Regent cried: “Your lordships' eloquence--”\r\n\r\nAnd as he said “eloquence”, a voice that was a scream, a\r\nforward-straining form, a pointing finger: “Why, my lords, that man is\r\nonly a common convict!--reprieved for murder--escaped from Colmoor. And\r\nall his forts are sunk!”\r\n\r\nIt happened that in the midst of this outcry, the Regent fell back\r\nafaint, the moles black, the face white.\r\n\r\nNow, here seemed simple panic: and like a pack of dogs which rush to\r\nmangle a mongrel, they were at him pell-mell.\r\n\r\nSee now a shocking scrimmage, a rush and crush for precedence, surge\r\nupon surge of men jostling each other in a struggle to get near him,\r\nsticks reaching awkwardly over heads to inflict far forceless blows, and\r\non his face the fists; a hundred roaring “Order!”, fighting against the\r\ntide; three hundred shrieking, “Kill him!” “Have him done with!” “Dash\r\nout his brains!”, and pressing to that job. Sergeant-at-Arms, meanwhile,\r\nClerk-attending-the-Table, and the physician, had run to give the alarm;\r\nbut it was by one of those miracles of wild minutes, when\r\nturbulent sprites appear to mix themselves in the business of men,\r\nworse--embroiling the embroiled, that through the throng in the street\r\nrushed the word that the Regent was being killed: and quick, before\r\nany fatal blow had been struck, the rabble were there in that chamber,\r\nhaving brushed away every barrier.\r\n\r\nThey imagined themselves come to save: in reality they came to\r\nkill--were, in fact, too many for the area of the room, so that men\r\nsuccumbed fast as by plague-stroke under trampling feet, and even after\r\ntwenty minutes when sixty-seven lay mangled the scene of horror could\r\nnot be said to be ended.\r\n\r\nEarly upon the irruption the physician, three policemen, a Reading\r\nClerk, and the Bishop of Durham, had managed to extricate and drag the\r\nRegent out; and through the shouting of the outside crowd he was driven\r\nhome unconscious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL\r\n\r\nTHE DECISION\r\n\r\n\r\nSomewhat before this hour Admiral O'Hara had arrived at Croydon, a\r\nlust, a morbid curiosity, now working in this man--having committed the\r\nineffable sin, to enjoy its fruit by hearing what Richard Hogarth now\r\nsaid, in what precise way he groaned, or raved, smiled, or wept, or\r\nstormed; for he was cruelly in love with Hogarth.\r\n\r\nAll the way had come with him the _Mahomet's_ treasurer, with his bag of\r\nwealth--and two pistols.\r\n\r\nSo at Dieppe O'Harra had wired to Harris:\r\n\r\n“Meet me at Croydon to-night, the 9.45 from Newhaven, as you love life.\r\nMost important. Shall expect wire from you at the London and Paris\r\nHotel, Newhaven, not later than six, saying yes”.\r\n\r\nBut at Newhaven he had found no answer--Harris, in fact, not having\r\nreceived the telegram, having already inflicted his stab, and fled the\r\nPalace.\r\n\r\nWhereupon O'Hara, in an agony of doubt, had telegraphed Frankl from\r\nNewhaven:\r\n\r\n“For God's sake find Harris. Make him meet me at Croydon to-night in the\r\n9.45 from Newhaven. Do not fail”.\r\n\r\nNow, Frankl knew exactly where Harris was--hiding in the Market Street\r\nhouse. And he said to himself: “All right: it's got something to do\r\nwith money, and a lot of it, too, with all this 'God's sake'. Suppose we\r\n_both_ go to Croydon?”\r\n\r\nHence Frankl missed the joy of seeing the Regent mobbed: for at 9.30 he\r\nwas waiting with Harris on the Croydon up-platform.\r\n\r\nAnd as the train stopped, they two hurried into the compartment where\r\nO'Hara sat alone.\r\n\r\n“You, my friend?” said O'Hara to Frankl.\r\n\r\n“Large as life”, replied Frankl: “I and the boy have already made it\r\nup between us for a third each: you a third, I a third, Alfie a third:\r\nthat's fair; I keep the police off the backs of the pair of you, and you\r\npay me a third. What's the figure?”\r\n\r\nIn one moment of silence O'Hara plotted; then his tongue yielded to the\r\ntemptation of the great words: “Eight-hundred-and-fifty thousand, sir”.\r\n\r\nSo after three minutes' talk Harris got out, and, as the train started,\r\nsprang into a first-class compartment in which was one other occupant.\r\n\r\nNow, it was natural that the treasurer, carrying such a sum, should\r\nscrutinize any stranger, but Harris disarmed suspicion: his right arm,\r\ntwisted by Hogarth, was in a sling, and he threw himself aside, and\r\nseemed to sleep, between the peak of his cap and his muffler hardly an\r\ninch of interval: so the treasurer, too, worn with travel, settled into\r\na half-drowse.\r\n\r\nHarris, however, like many of his type, was perfectly ambidextrous,\r\noften using the left hand by preference; and as the train passed\r\nBromley, he darted, plunged his knife, streaked with the Regent's blood,\r\ninto the treasurer's heart, and huddled the body under the seat.\r\n\r\nNo stoppage till London Bridge, where, with the bag, Harris left the\r\ntrain, Frankl and O'Hara trotting after his burdened haste; and, after\r\ntwo changes of cabs, the three arrived at the Market Street house.\r\n\r\nThere Harris laid the bag on the floor of an empty back room, where\r\nthrough a broken window came a little light, and the three stood looking\r\ndown upon the bag, solemnly as upon a body.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Harris: “Come, gentlemen of the jury, let's have my share\r\nof the dead meat: and 'ere's off out of it for this child--only this\r\nblooming arm of mine! it's going to get me nabbed as sure as sticks.\r\nNever mind--trot it out, Captain! and don't cheat an innocent orphan,\r\nlest the ravens of the valley pick out the yellow galls of some o' you”.\r\n\r\nNeither of the other two, however, seemed anxious for the division; and\r\nafter a minute's silence Frankl said: “The third of 850, I _believe_, is\r\n2, 8, 3; how are we going to carry away 283 thousand without something\r\nto put it in? I vote, Pat, that we leave the bag here, and come and\r\ndivide at midnight sharp. How would that do?”\r\n\r\n“Yes”, said Harris, “I think I see old Pat leaving the lot with me--what\r\nO! You know 'ow I'd fondle it for you, and keep it out of the cold, cold\r\nworld, till you came back, don't you, you bald-headed priest?”\r\n\r\n“Shut your mouth, boy. We can't take it away without something, as Mr.\r\nFrankl very justly observes. Aren't there some safes, Frankl, in Adair\r\nStreet?”\r\n\r\n“Right you are: and one, as I happen to know, empty. Who'll keep the\r\nkey?”\r\n\r\n“You, if you like, my friend. I'll keep the keys of the room-doors. And\r\nHarris will stand guard”.\r\n\r\n“The very thing”, remarked Frankl.\r\n\r\nSo it was agreed. Harris took the bag; they descended to the cellar;\r\nthen, striking matches, down three marl steps to the subterranean way\r\nmade for Hogarth; and along it, forty feet, they stumbled bent, Harris\r\ngripped by each sleeve.\r\n\r\nThen in the Adair Street Board Room they lit a candle, and in the room\r\nnext it found the safes, the largest of which admitting the bag, Frankl\r\nlocked its door, took the key; O'Hara then locked the room door, took\r\nthe key; and at the stair-bottom locked another door, took the key; so\r\nthat Frankl could not now get at the bag without him, nor he without\r\nFrankl, nor Harris without both.\r\n\r\nTwo then went away, while Harris, sprawling cynically on a solitary\r\nchair down in the parlour with straight open legs, awaited the\r\n_rendezvous_ at twelve.\r\n\r\nHe had not, however, sat very long, when the taper at his feet glared\r\non a face of terror at a sound of ghosts in the tomb that the house was,\r\nand he started to his feet, prone, snatching his knife--thinking, as\r\nalways, of the Only Reality, the police. But he had not prowled three\r\necstatic steps when O'Hara stood before him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, damned fool!” he went with infinite contempt and reproach, “to\r\nfrighten anybody like that! What's it you are after now? Frighten\r\nanybody like that....”\r\n\r\n“_Alfie_!”--O'Hara whispered it breathfully as the hoarse sirocco,\r\nstepping daintily like the peacock. Tell it not in Gath! If Alfie rammed\r\nthe knife into the marrow of Frankl's back at the moment when the safe\r\nwas opened, then Alfie would have, not a third, but a half; and the\r\nthing was desirable for this reason: that a half is greater than a\r\nthird...\r\n\r\nHarris saw that: but he seemed reluctant, meditating upon the ground;\r\nthen walking, hands in pockets.\r\n\r\n“Why, boy, he is only an interloper”, said O'Hara: “I meant the money to\r\nbe divided fairly between you and me. Why should this Jew come in?”\r\n\r\n“All right”, said Harris: “I don't mind”.\r\n\r\n“And I know a little castle in Granada, Alfie, which we'll buy--”\r\n\r\n“All right: you go away. It's agreed”.\r\n\r\nAnd O'Hara hurried away, took a cab, drove for the Palace; while Harris,\r\nleft alone, sat serious, with sprawling straight legs, and presently\r\nmuttered: “Blind me, I must be going dotty or something! p'raps it's\r\nthis arm....”\r\n\r\nHe had not thought of killing Frankl, until it had been suggested!--some\r\nclass-habit, or instinct, of honour among thieves (which, however, his\r\nreason despised)...But five minutes after O'Hara had gone he started\r\nalert, staring, with tight fist, and, “All right, you two”, said he,\r\n“blood it is!”\r\n\r\nHe sat again: and again, after twenty minutes, the house gave a\r\nsound--Frankl, who had let himself in by the front door, each member\r\npossessing a key to that.\r\n\r\n“Well, Alf”, said he, “all alone? Then, we two can have a little chat\r\nbetween us little two”.\r\n\r\nAnd he stood and talked, while Harris sprawled and listened, Frankl's\r\nroad to his end being more circuitous than O'Hara's, more hedged, too,\r\nwith reasons, scruples, sanctions: but he reached it, pointing out that\r\na half is greater than a third; also that O'Hara would be a continual\r\nwitness against Harris' past, whereas he, Frankl, left England for Asia\r\nthe next morning.\r\n\r\nAlfie pretended aversion to bloodshed, but finally consented; upon which\r\nFrankl went away, and took cab for Scotland Yard: his idea being to have\r\nHarris arrested red-handed in the murder of O'Hara.\r\n\r\nThe streets through which he drove wore a singular aspect--of commotion,\r\nhurry, unrest, two dragoon-orderlies galloping past him at the Marble\r\nArch, in Whitehall the tramp of some line-regiment battalion, and\r\nhe said to himself: “He is going to fight it out with them, I\r\nsuppose--Satan take the lot!”\r\n\r\nAt Scotland Yard he said to the Inspector in Charge, having given his\r\ncard, that if two officers were placed at his disposition, he might\r\nbe able to lead them to the arrest of a man long “wanted”, who now\r\npremeditated another murder.\r\n\r\nMeantime, O'Hara was in conversation with Loveday in the Regent's\r\nlibrary, nearer the centre of which stood a group of four with their\r\nheads together--Prime Minister, First Lord, War Office Secretary, a\r\nNaval Lord; further still, a spurred General, cloaked over his out-stuck\r\nsword, writing, with a wet white brow; and, “I suppose he will want to\r\nsee you”, said Loveday, “if you have anything to say. But the doctors\r\nhave first to be reckoned with: I suppose you know that he has been\r\nstabbed and beaten”.\r\n\r\n“Stabbed! by whom?”\r\n\r\n“By Harris”.\r\n\r\n“No! When?”\r\n\r\n“This afternoon”.\r\n\r\n“Ah! I did not know”.\r\n\r\n“It was by your recommendation, it appears, that Harris became Captain\r\nMacnaghten's servant”, said Loveday with his smile, looking very gaunt\r\nand bent-down.\r\n\r\n“Tut, sir!”--from O'Hara--“you are not my judge: I am here to see the\r\nLord of the Sea, my King”.\r\n\r\n“Ah!--you still give him the title”.\r\n\r\nAnd now O'Hara, drawing his chair nearer to ask: “_How did he take it?_”\r\n stretching back the waiting mouth to hear that thing.\r\n\r\n“The Lord Regent? Well, at eight-thirty he went to the House of Lords,\r\nwhere they beat him nearly to death on the throne, the gentle hearts,\r\nand the doctors forbade me to speak to him of the Sea; but his eyes\r\nseemed to question me, so I leant over, and told him”.\r\n\r\n“Yes--and whatever did he say?”\r\n\r\nHe said: “'What, old Pat?'”\r\n\r\nO'Hara rose to stand by a hearth, black-robed to the heels and tonsured,\r\nand at the angle of his jaw some sinews ribbed and moved: not a syllable\r\nnow from him.\r\n\r\n“I am going in now to him”, said Loveday: “if you care to wait here, I\r\nwill see”--and passing through a palace pretty busy that night with\r\nfeet and a thousand working purposes, went to sit at the sick bed, the\r\ndoctors retiring.\r\n\r\n“How is the pain?”\r\n\r\n“The pain”, said the Regent very weakly, “is nonsense: I am not going to\r\nbe bullied by doctors, but shall do exactly as I like”.\r\n\r\n“And what is that, Richard?”\r\n\r\n“There is a Normandy village, John, called Valée-les-Noisettes--white\r\nhouses with an extraordinary sound of forest about, one of Poussin's\r\nlandscapes, with a smithy under a chestnut precisely as in the poem; and\r\nthe blacksmith is a charming man. I dare say someone will find me money\r\nenough to purchase a share of his smithy: and with him I shall work,\r\nstarting for him before sunrise, with my sister”.\r\n\r\nLoveday, wondering if he was delirious, said irrelevantly: “I have to\r\ntell you that by five A.M. there will be 15,000 additional infantry in\r\nLondon, with--”\r\n\r\n“Ah, I wish they'd lend them me to send out to those poor Jews, John.\r\nBut, for myself--I was mad when I gave that order. It won't do! the\r\nworld is addicted to its orbit, and relapses. I don't say that it\r\nwill be always so, but it is now. As against the Empire of the Sea\r\narises--Pat O'Hara; as against the brushing aside of these rebels\r\narise--Germany, Russia, the hostile world. Consider the rancour of the\r\nnations at Britain's late advantages in sea-rent, try to conceive the\r\nscream of jubilation that rings to the sky to-night against her, and\r\nagainst me. Do you think I could _now_ start a civil war in England? for\r\nthe satisfaction of my own pride? I call God to witness that never for\r\nmy own pride have I done aught, but that the Kingdom of God might\r\ncome. I know that bitter tears will flow at the fall of the righteous\r\nman--many calling me 'traitor' for abandoning those ready to die for me.\r\nYet it shall be. I never thought to fail, to fly, John Loveday, chased\r\nby such little fellows: but God has done it. Well, then, the smithy. You\r\nand all, therefore, will find enough to do to-night”.\r\n\r\nLoveday lifted a face streaming with tears to say: “The man, O'Hara,\r\nwaits to see you”.\r\n\r\n“Really? Well, come, we will see him....” and in some minutes O'Hara was\r\nthere by the bedside, the eyes of the two fixed together, over Hogarth's\r\nface five oblongs of sticking-plaster, his head bandaged, and at a\r\ncorner of O'Hara's mouth a twitching.\r\n\r\n“Pat, did you betray me?” asked Hogarth.\r\n\r\nO'Hara nodded: “Yes”.\r\n\r\n“Well, you may sit and tell me, and ease your poor heart”.\r\n\r\nAnd a long time O'Hara sat, going into the mighty crime, torturing\r\ndetails, revelling in the vastness of the horror, the sickness of the\r\nself-inflicted filth, and pangs of the self-inflicted scalpel.\r\n\r\n“And why did you do it, my friend?”\r\n\r\n“Because I worship you....”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps I understand you, crooked soul. But what will you do\r\nnow?”\r\n\r\n“We shall see. What will you?”\r\n\r\n“I am going to France to live as a private person”.\r\n\r\n“Tut, you remain as simple as a child: the earth's not large enough to\r\ncontain you, you couldn't now remain a private person for three weeks.\r\nCome, I have discrowned you: I will give you another crown, though I\r\nshall never see you wear it. Why not go to your own people?”\r\n\r\n“Which people?”\r\n\r\n“The Jews”.\r\n\r\n“Don't talk that same madness”.\r\n\r\n“My time with you is short, Raphael Spinoza”--O'Hara glanced at his\r\nwatch--“in five minutes we part, never, I do assure you, to meet\r\nagain. Listen, then, to me: you are a Jew. I knew your mother--the most\r\nintellectual woman, I suppose, who ever drew breath, the only one whom I\r\nhave loved; and I should have known you merely from your resemblance\r\nto her at my first glance at you in Colmoor, though I had more precise\r\ndata: the three moles, the bloodshot eye, for didn't I baptize you?\r\nhaven't I rocked you in my arms? You know St. Hilda on the hill over\r\nWestring, which you found me examining that morning after our escape\r\nfrom the prison? I was priest there, three years, and twice I have\r\nconfessed her--ah! and remember it! for when your foster-father wanted\r\nher to turn Methodist, she wouldn't stand that, and since she must needs\r\nbe a _meshumad_ (apostate), became a Catholic. Well, now, I once saw at\r\nThring, and once in the _Boodah_, an old goat-hair trunk of yours: what\r\nis become of it?”\r\n\r\n“I have it--” Hogarth was shivering, his eyes wide, and in his memory a\r\nstrange singsong crooning of _t'hillim_, heard ages before in some other\r\nworld over a cradle.\r\n\r\n“Did you know that that trunk has a false bottom?” asked O'Hara.\r\n\r\n“Yes”.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you knew...And have you never seen a bundle of papers under it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--I assumed them to be old farm-accounts....”\r\n\r\n“They are all the proofs you need concerning your birth; it is _my_\r\ntrunk by the way--Ah, I must go!”\r\n\r\nAt the door he fastened upon Hogarth a last reluctant gaze to say\r\ngood-bye, but Hogarth, staring wildly afar, did not turn his eyes, and\r\nO'Hara, with a sigh, was gone.\r\n\r\nHe drove to Adair Street, and, as he passed by a mews, Frankl, waiting\r\nthere with two detectives, saw him by a street-light, but made no\r\nremark.\r\n\r\nWhen O'Hara entered the house, he looked about for Harris, but Harris\r\nhad gone to the lodging of a woman in James Street near, to arrange a\r\nhiding-place for the bag, passing out through the Market Street house;\r\nand O'Hara, opening the two locked doors, entered the safe-room, where\r\nhe stood waiting, his forehead low, resting on the steel top; and now a\r\nsob throbbed through his frame, and his lips let out “..._so lovely...so\r\ngreat_....”\r\n\r\nCount a minute's stillness: and now the man's soul and being foundered\r\nin a storm of sorrow, and half-words borne on shivering puffs of breath,\r\nand choking groans, broke the stillness: “My Liege! Richard! my King!”\r\n\r\nThis died to silence; and now he roamed the room with furious steps,\r\nand lowering brow, and an out-pushed under-lip, until, deciding, he\r\ndrew from his pocket a penknife, opened it, leant now one elbow on the\r\nsafe-top, blade in hand, considered, considered, hesitating, then with\r\nlifted chin and the thinnest whimpering like a puppy, pretty pitiful,\r\ncut from under his left ear to the chin.\r\n\r\nCertainly a hurt so shallow could never have killed, for the hand had\r\nbeen cherishingly restrained, and the thing was no sooner done than\r\nthe priest, seeing that he did not die, ran horror-eyed, streaming with\r\nblood, shouting a hoarse whisper: “Help! help! help!”\r\n\r\nBut at that cry he sighed, fell back, and effectually died, his heart\r\npierced by the knife of Harris.\r\n\r\nAnd some moments later the face of Frankl, who bore a candle, looked in\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n“Is that all right, Alfie?”--in the weakest whisper.\r\n\r\n“Come on in, and don't ask any questions”, said Harris.\r\n\r\nFrankl entered, peered upon the dead visage of the priest; then, the\r\ndetectives being now behind the parlour-door below, with handcuffs, rose\r\nto run to summon them: but, to his horror, Harris was now before the\r\ndoor; he saw in the candlelight those eyes of Alfie fixed upon him: and\r\nhe knew: before the least threat or movement by Harris, the Jew sent to\r\nHeaven a piercing shriek, his hour come....\r\n\r\n“...dirty-livered Jew...” striking in the breast, and, as Frankl fell,\r\nhe gave him one other in the temple, with “Down, down to hell, and\r\nsye _I_ sent thee thither”; and to dead O'Hara near he gave one in the\r\ncheek, with “Go up, thou bald-head, it _is_”: all in two seconds' space;\r\nand he was now about to turn anew to hack at Frankl, when his keen ear\r\nheard a creak; and he sprang up a spinning motionlessness--the Reality\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nAnd instantly on the realization of that fact, he was submissive,\r\nreverent, as before the very Helmet of Pallas, goddess of Blue; and said\r\nhe with sullen dejection, reverent of the Helmet, but easy with the man:\r\n“All right: you've beat me...I suppose it's that Regent-stabbing affair\r\nbrought you: it was I did it all right”.\r\n\r\nWhen they went down, almost from the door a crowd gathered, pressing\r\nclose, Harris' hands and front all red from O'Hara's throat; and when\r\none policeman, big with the fact, whispered a gentleman: “You may have\r\nheard, sir, that the Regent was stabbed to-day--it's been kept precious\r\ndark, but the fact's so: this is the beauty as done it”, like loosened\r\neffluvia that news flew--but distorted, largened--the stains were\r\nRegent's blood!--and beyond measure had the crowd spread ere it reached\r\nthe Edgware Road.\r\n\r\nThere at the corner, as the officers looked about for a cab, and one\r\nblew a whistle, a man reached out and fiercely struck Harris on the\r\nface, while another shouted: “Lynch the beggar!”; and now arose a\r\nhustling, huddled impulses, and now in full vogue that grave noising of\r\ncongregations when the voice of God jogs them; while Harris, excessively\r\npallid, handcuffed, began to whistle; a number of other police now\r\nseeking the crowd's centre, but with difficulty; a cab, too, slowly\r\nmaking a way which closed like water round it: and when this had nearly\r\nreached him, Harris, in his eagerness to get in, sprang far toward\r\nit--and slipped. He never rose again: the crowd rolled over his last\r\nhowl, and in the midst of a great row as of hounds, trampled him to a\r\npaste.\r\n\r\nAbout that very time that better man whom he had stabbed, in tying up\r\nin bed a bundle of old papers, was saying: “Yes, I will go to my\r\npeople”....\r\n\r\nAnd by six A.M. he was up, in his study, dressed, looking quite owlish\r\nwith his excess of eyes, which, however, danced at the first news of the\r\nmorning--the arrival at Portsmouth of the _Boodah II_., which had raced\r\nlike a carrier-bird since 8.30 P.M. of the 29th, full of the news of the\r\nvanished _Mahomet_: on her being 200 marines.\r\n\r\nAfter that he spoke through the telephone with various\r\nGovernment-offices, early astir that morning, till the Private Secretary\r\nlooked in with the announcement that his train would be ready in ten\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nHis last act in the Palace was the sending to the Treasurer at\r\nJerusalem, for Miss Frankl, the telegram:\r\n\r\n   “Be surprised, but believe: I am a Jew.”\r\n                   “RICHARD”.\r\n\r\nOf the Household some fifty, catching wind of what was toward, offered,\r\neven begged, to go with him; but in general he refused, and set out with\r\na suite of only seven.\r\n\r\nThey reached Hastings at twenty minutes to ten, where, to the disgust\r\nof all, the region of Central Station was found crowded; whereupon Sir\r\nFrancis Yeames held a consultation with a local rector, and a dash was\r\nmade to a private hotel near the pier.\r\n\r\nThere, looking from behind window curtains at eleven, Hogarth saw before\r\na paper-shop:\r\n\r\nFLIGHT OF THE REGENT\r\n\r\nA minute afterwards he started backward from the splintered window.\r\n\r\nEverything was known:\r\n\r\nLIFE-HISTORY OF THE CONVICT HOGARTH MARVELLOUS DETAILS\r\n\r\nThe street, to its two vanishing-points, was one scene of hats, mixed\r\nwith upturned faces: and it was an aggressive crowd that gave out a\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nNot till noon did the _Boodah II._ arrive; and then there was no setting\r\nout--all the front windows of the house now broken, and in the town a\r\nrow like the feeding-time of lions, which uttered “coward”, “murderer”,\r\n“convict”, “traitor”. Hogarth had been put to bed, the two ladies\r\nwere in a state of scare, Margaret anon crying on Loveday's shoulder,\r\ndeclaring that “_He_” (meaning Frankl) was in the crowd, and coming,\r\ncoming, boring his way: she had seen him.\r\n\r\nAt last, near four P.M., a portion of the yard-wall at the back was\r\nbroken down by the party, Hogarth was raised and dressed, and through\r\nthe breach the party passed into another back-yard, then made beachward,\r\nHogarth leaning on the arm of Sir Martin Phipps; but they had no sooner\r\ncome to the Esplanade than they were surrounded, and when, on their\r\nattaining the pier, the pier-turnstile was closed against the mob, it\r\nwas impossible to conceive whence so many missiles came. Once Hogarth\r\nstopped, faced round, looked at them, but now a pebble bruised his left\r\ntemple, and he dropped, fainting.\r\n\r\nCaught up by Sir Martin, Loveday, Sir Francis Yeames, and Colonel\r\nLord Hallett of the body-guard, he was hurried, a hanging concave with\r\nabandoned head, to the long-waiting boat, and it was in a scurry of\r\nescape, out of stroke, that the oarsmen rowed away.\r\n\r\nYonder lay the yacht with her fires banked, and was soon under weigh.\r\n\r\nShe had started, when a harbour-master's motor-boat was observed giving\r\nchase, in her an officer from Scotland Yard who bore a bag, found by\r\nmeans of the key in Frankl's pocket in the Adair Street safe; on its\r\nclasp the name “Mahomet”, and it contained £850,000: so that the yacht\r\nwent wealthy on her way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI\r\n\r\nTHE MODEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voyage to Palestine was marked by two events: one the stoppage at\r\nTarifa, where the five hundred from the _Mahomet_ were, these, when\r\ntaken on board the _Boodah II._, making an armed force of 700; and then,\r\ntoward sunset of the fifth day, a steamer exchanged signals with the\r\n_Boodah II._, enquired after the whereabouts of the Lord of the Sea,\r\nreceived the reply “on board”, and when she stopped it turned out that\r\nshe had on board a Jewish Petition urging upon Spinoza to come and throw\r\nin his lot with them. And here again was that name of Rebekah, spelled\r\nnow Ribkah.\r\n\r\nFor the news of his fall--the fact that he was a Jew--had created a\r\nmighty stirring in Israel, of wonder, of the pride of race.\r\n\r\nBy the seventh day the yacht was off the Palestine coast, and Joppa,\r\nseated on her cliffs, appeared over a foaming roadstead. But when a\r\nlanding was effected, they were to hear that there had been a collision\r\non the Jerusalem-Joppa railway, the line blocked, travel suspended; so,\r\nas the filthy town was congested, the Royal party took refuge in a great\r\nrestaurant-tent, set up by a Polish Jew in gaberdine and fur cap, who\r\nvociferated invitation at the door. All was mud, beggary, narrowness,\r\nchaos, picturesque woe. Yet work had commenced: between the upper and\r\nthe nether millstone a woman ground corn at a doorway; the camel passed\r\nloaded; the dragoman went with quicker step. In the afternoon Spinoza,\r\nwandering beyond the outskirts of the town, saw in an orange-grove,\r\nsitting before a roofless hut, six diligent two-handed Jews exhaustively\r\ndrawing the cord of the cobbler; further still, and saw what could only\r\nhave been a Petticoat-Lane Jew ploughing with a little cow and a camel:\r\nand he smiled, thanking God, and taking courage--had always loved this\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he procured a number of clumsy waggons, with horses,\r\nasses, camels, and provisions; and his caravan set out, to travel all\r\nday over a plain, a “goodly land,” the almond-tree in blossom, orange\r\nand olive, everywhere lilies, the scarlet anemone, he considering\r\nhimself so familiar with the way, that he was their only guide, though\r\nthe morning was misty; and through the plain of Sharon they wended over\r\nthe worst roads in existence, until, passing into a country of rocks,\r\nthey made out afar the mountains of Judæa, whose patches of white stone\r\nlook like snow in sunshine, on the roads streams of wayfarers, tending\r\nall eastward to Jerusalem, lines of camels and waggons, pedestrians\r\nwith wine-skins, mother and sucking child on the solitary ass, and the\r\nBedouin troop; but Spinoza was all solitary among fastnesses on the\r\nthird forenoon when he muttered nervously: “I must certainly have lost\r\nthe way”.\r\n\r\nThereupon he called halt, and the caravan turned back to re-find the\r\nroad, Spinoza prying on camel-back foremost, clad now in the caftan and\r\nwhite robes of the Orient.\r\n\r\nBut all day the caravan wandered out of the track in a white sea of\r\nmist: no farmstead, nor cot, but the wild vine, and the wild fig, and\r\ntwice a telegraph-tree, still with its bark on, and the abandoned hold\r\nof a bandit-sheik. Finally, near six P.M., Spinoza, finding himself in\r\na valley-bottom, sent out the order to pitch camp: upon which the tents\r\nwere fixed near a brook, waggons grouped around, and animals picketed\r\nto grass. Spinoza, the two ladies, and Loveday, then ate together at the\r\ndoor of one tent; after which he rose and strolled away, thinking how\r\nbest to handle this crab of Israel.\r\n\r\nHe noticed that the mist was lifting a little; and suddenly, as he\r\nstrolled, he stood still, listening: for remote tones of singing or\r\nmourning seemed to meet his ear--from the west: and in some moments more\r\nhe saw the Mount of Olives--to the west, not, as he believed that it\r\nmust be, to the east, he having, in fact, in losing his way from the\r\ncoast, passed by Jerusalem to the north; and on the other side of the\r\nMount of Olives, from its foot to the Brook Kedron, spread at that\r\nmoment over the Valley of Jehosophat an innumerable multitude, covered\r\nin praying-shawls, many prostrate, many with the keen and stressful face\r\nof supplication lifted in appeal to God, that He would visit His people,\r\nand turn again in this latter day to His lost and helpless flock. Every\r\nchild of Israel who could contrive it, at whatever cost, was there,\r\nsince it was the prophesied day of--“the Coming”.\r\n\r\nBut a bold woman, summoning her fainting strength, bracing her trembling\r\nknee, stepped a little up the hillside to fling high her hand as a\r\nsign--Rebecca Frankl, celebrated now through Israel as the elect of the\r\nsibyl Estrella; and at that signal the congregation, gazing keenly into\r\nheaven, lifted up their voice in meek song, singing the sibyl's “Hymn to\r\nthe Messiah”:\r\n\r\n“The oceans trudge and tire their soul, desiring Thee; and night-winds\r\nhomeless roam with dole, reproaching Thee; the clouds aspire, and find\r\nno goal, and gush for Thee, reproaching Thee.”\r\n\r\n“Thou scrawled'st 'I mean' in rocks and men, in trends and streams; the\r\nprophets raved, to sages' ken Thou shewed'st dreams; Thou shrouded'st\r\ndark the How and When in starry schemes, and trends and streams.”\r\n\r\n“The jungles blare, the glebe-lands low and bleat for Thee; the\r\ngenerations rage and go, agaze for Thee; creation travaileth in woe,\r\nwith groans for Thee, agaze for Thee.”\r\n\r\n“Adonai, come! with crashing rote of chariots come; or moonlight-mild,\r\nalone, afloat, Messussah, come; with floods of lutes, or thundering\r\nthroat, but come! O, come! Messussah come.”\r\n\r\n“The Arctics hawk-up their haunted heart, and raucous, spue; and\r\nnorth-winds, wawling calls, outstart, to droop anew; the clouds like\r\nscouts updart, depart, and truceless do, and droop anew.”\r\n\r\n“How long! They breeds have waited fain what sibyls ween; Thou\r\nscribbled'st in their secret brain 'I scheme; I mean'; the\r\nconstellations stray and strain: Break out! be seen what sibyls ween”.\r\n\r\n“The pampas stamp and, nomad, low, reposeless, lone; raging the\r\ngenerations trow, and drudge, and drown; a anguished glance this latter\r\nwoe throws to Thy Throne, reposeless, lone”...\r\n\r\nBefore them, above them, as they sang stood--a man.\r\n\r\nHard by a wall of that Moslem mosque, once a chapel which marked the\r\nsupposed spot of “the Ascension”, he stood, in an attitude of suspense,\r\nastonishment, his body half-twisted--Spinoza.\r\n\r\nAn instant, and he was aware of Jerusalem lying “as a city that is\r\ncompact” before him--not to the east--to the west! Yet another instant,\r\nand he realized that the whole tract of humanity--man, woman, child--was\r\non its face before him.\r\n\r\nA faintness overcame him, shame, dismay; then, his blood now rushing to\r\nhis brow, his mouth sent out the passionate shout:\r\n\r\n“Not to _me!_ Not to _me! I am the Lord of the Sea....!_”\r\n\r\nBut when the people heard this, saw him, knew him, they remained in\r\nadoration....\r\n\r\nBy a special ship they had sent him a petition to come; here he was\r\nweeks sooner than ship or airship could have conveyed him: and they took\r\nhim as the answer to their supplication, the answer which Heaven willed,\r\nin the sure and certain faith that he would cure their ache, and the\r\nache of the world.\r\n\r\nAn acclamation like the voice of many waters arose and rolled below him,\r\nand on the bosom of that tumult he moved among them into the Holy City,\r\nas darkness covered all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe took the title of Shophet, or Judge, and for sixty years ruled over\r\nIsrael.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the initial “pull” over other nations possessed\r\nby Israel (in respect of the sea-forts remaining in the Gulf of Aden,\r\nYellow Sea, Western Pacific) was the cause of his rise as of some\r\nthrice-ardent Star of the Morning and asterisk dancing in the dawn's\r\ndark: for the other nations, timorous of one another, made never an\r\nattempt to build; but, for our share, we insist that anyway Judæa was\r\nbound to become what she became--indeed, sea-rent after the Regency\r\ncollapse was decreased at the three forts, and suddenly in the twelfth\r\nyear of his judgeship Spinoza ordered its stoppage.\r\n\r\nBy which period the University of Jerusalem had become the chief\r\nnerve-centre of the world's research and upward effort: for in creating\r\na “civilized State”--“proud and happy”--Spinoza did it with that\r\nspinning rapidity of the modernization of Japan, so that in whatever\r\nrespects it was not a question of months, it was a question of not many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nFor, as in the soul of the Jewish people abode as before that genius for\r\nrighteousness which wrote the Bible, and as the soul of righteousness\r\nlies even in this; Thou shalt not steal, therefore Israel with some\r\nlittle pain attained to this: whereupon with startling emphasis was\r\nbrought to pass that statement: “Righteousness exalteth a nation”.\r\n\r\nFor the promise says: “I will put a new spirit within them”; and\r\nthis--very rapidly--found fulfilment.\r\n\r\nWhereupon others fast, faster, found fulfilment, so that a stale and\r\nbitter word was in Pall Mall, saying: “The lot of them seem to have\r\nformed themselves into a syndicate to run the prophecies”.\r\n\r\nAgain the promise has it: “I shall be with them”; and again: “They shall\r\nbe a cleansed nation”; and again: “They shall fear Him”.\r\n\r\nThe transformation was rapid for the reason that it was natural, seeing\r\nthat it had been Europe only that, like a Circe, had bewitched them into\r\nbeastial shapes, “sharks”, and “bulls”, and “bears”, mediæval Jews, for\r\nexample, having been debarred from every pursuit save commerce: so that\r\nShylock was obliged to turn into a Venetian; and, in ceasing to be a\r\nHebrew, became more Venetian than the Venetians, for the reason that he\r\nhad more brains, ready to beat them at any game they cared to mention;\r\nbut the genuine self of Shylock was a vine-dresser or sandal-maker, as\r\nHillel was a wood-chopper, David a shepherd, Amos a fig-gatherer, Saul\r\nan ass-driver, Rabbi Ben Zakkai a sail-maker, Paul a tent-maker: so that\r\nthe return to simplicity and honesty was quickly accomplished.\r\n\r\nAnd now, that done, behold a wonder: at the whirling of a wand the swine\r\nof Circe converted back to biped man; whereupon without fail whatsoever\r\nhe does it shall astonishingly prosper: that succession of wits, seers,\r\nsavants, Heines, Einsteins, inspired mouths, pens of iridium, brushes\r\nfrom the archangel's plumage, discoveries, new Americas, elations,\r\nsensations--in therapeutics--in aero-nautics-beyond-the-atmosphere--in\r\nthe powers involved in sub-atoms--in the powers, latent till now,\r\ninvolved in soul...for now each of millions was free to think, free\r\nto manifest his own particular luck and knack in discovery, having\r\na country, foothold, not hovering like Noah's dove, urging still the\r\npurposeless wing not to pitch into nowhere: for the promise says: “Ye\r\nshall not sow and another reap, ye shall not plant and another garner”,\r\nbut in a land of gentlemen ye shall live, as it were to swellings of\r\nmusic, while a noble height grows upon your smooth foreheads, and the\r\nsum-total of the blending movements of your bodies and brains shall, as\r\nseen from heaven, appear the minuet of a people.\r\n\r\nWithin forty years mighty works had been done: forts, irrigation of\r\ndeserts, reclamation of the Dead Sea, passionate temples clapped to\r\nthe lower clouds about the perpetual lamp, and that baroque Art of the\r\nOrient which at the Judges progresses in Summer through the country\r\nwould draw multitudes of foreigners to gape at so great pomp, at\r\nCorinthian cities full of grace and riches which had arisen to crown\r\nwith many crowns that plain of Mesopotamia, and where desolate Tyre had\r\nmourned her purples, and old Tadmor in the Wilderness (Palmyra) had sat\r\nin dirt; to gape, too, at a Jerusalem which in twenty years had crossed\r\nthe Valley of Jehosophat, and might really then be called “the Golden”,\r\na purged Babylon, a London burnt to ashes and rebuilt somewhere else:\r\nfor the Shophet proved true Duke and Leader, born mountaineer, climbing\r\nfrom pinnacle to wild pinnacle, becking his people after him with many a\r\nmeaningful gesture skyward and suggesting smile; and Israel followed his\r\nthrilling way, hearing always the Excelsior of his calling as it were\r\nthe voice direct of Heaven. What no merits of his could give, the land\r\nwhich he had chosen gave, Mesopotamia pretty soon proving herself a\r\ntreasury of mineral riches: here is bdellium and the onyx-stone; and\r\nwhere the streaming Pison, dawdling, draws his twine of waters over that\r\nhappy valley of Havilah, there is gold--hoard stored from before the\r\nEozoic, as misers bury for their heirs, in mine and friable quarry,\r\nrollick rain: “and the gold of _that_ land is good”.\r\n\r\nHere was not merely progress, but progress at increasing\r\nspeed--acceleration--finally resembling flight, as of eagle or phoenix,\r\neye fixed on the sun: Tyre by the fiftieth year having grown into the\r\nbiggest of ports, her quays unloading 6,700,000 tons a year, mart of\r\ntangled masts, felucca, galiot, junk, cargoes of Tarshish and the Isles,\r\nLevantine stuffs, spice from the Southern Sea; while Jerusalem had grown\r\ninto the recognized school of the wealthier youth of Europe, Asia and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nFor it says: “The Kings of the earth shall bring their honour and glory\r\nunto her”; and again: “She shall reign gloriously”.\r\n\r\nAnd not Israel alone reaped the fruits of his own fine weather, but his\r\ndews fell wide. For it says: “They shall be as dew from the Lord”; and\r\nagain: “They shall fill the face of the earth with fruit”; and again:\r\n“All nations shall call them blessed”.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was: for the example of Israel, his suasive charm, proved\r\ncompelling as sunshine to shoots, so that that heart of Spinoza lived to\r\nsee the spectacle of a whole world deserting the gory path of Rome to\r\ngo up into those uplands of mildness and gleefulness whither invites the\r\nsmile of that lily Galilean.\r\n\r\nThe mission of “unbelieving” Israel was to convert Christendom to\r\nChristianity: and this he did.\r\n\r\nWe watch the Judge coming down the Mount of Olives in the midst of a\r\njubilant throng all involved in a noise of timbrels and instruments of\r\nmusic: for his life was simple and one with the life of his people.\r\nIt is evening, all the west yonder a bewitched Kingdom charm-embathed,\r\nwherein a barge of Venus bethronged with loves and roses voyages on a\r\nsea of dalliance en route for the last Beatific--the last, the seventh,\r\nHeaven--whitherward gads all a pilgrim-swarm of enraptured spirits, all,\r\nall thitherward, Paul caught up with clothes aflaunt, and soaring\r\neagle, Enoch transfigured, green hippogriff, hop of squatted frog;\r\nand thitherward trots with blinkings, bleating, the Ram of the Golden\r\nFleece, the flagrant flamingos flap and go.\r\n\r\nThe Judge, hoary-headed now, in a robe of cloth-of-silver which rippled,\r\nhad but now got home from a Pilgrimage; and the time was Simcath Torah,\r\nthe Rejoicing of the Law, and the carrying of Candles, in the month.\r\nTishri: silver his robe and silver his hair that hung round a brown and\r\npuckered skin, but silvery, too, his every tooth still, and his vigour\r\ngood; and, as down the Mount of Olives he stepped, he saw Mount Sion and\r\nthat Temple that he had piled, across whose roughened frontispiece of\r\ngold glowed in a bow, bold like the rainbow's, in characters of blazing\r\nsapphire and chrysoprase, that inscription:\r\n\r\n“Y'HOVAH B'KOKMAR YSAD ARETS, CONEN SHAMAIM B'THBUNAH”\r\n\r\nand, as he saw it, lo, buoyancy caught the old man's feet: for the\r\ncymballing and music had grown very fiercely hot, so that all the\r\ncongregation reeled in dance; and as the lasso drops round the\r\nastonished prairie-horse and draws asprawl, so dancing caught and drew\r\nhis foot, and he danced.\r\n\r\nAnd his wife Rebecca, mother of many sons, prying from a window-lattice,\r\nwrithed odd the eyebrows of the cynic, one beyond the other: for not\r\nwith foot alone he danced, but his wrung belly laboured in that travail\r\nof Orient dancing; and she turned and smiled to Margaret Loveday\r\na turned-down smile, implying shrug, implying girding, her eyelids\r\nlowered, yet indulgent of his nature's rage.\r\n\r\nAnd not with foot and abdomen alone he danced, but his two balancing\r\npalms danced to the beat of the heat of the music's heart; and with heel\r\nand toe he danced. And as he danced, he sang, all apant, filling up\r\nwith nonsense-sounds when the rhythm's imperative tramp outran his\r\nimprovisation; and singing he danced, and dancing sang: with abdomen and\r\narms he danced, and with toe and heel he danced.\r\n\r\nAnd dancing he sang:\r\n\r\n  My hands,\r\n  be dancing to God,\r\n  your Guide,\r\n    And peal my pipes,\r\n    and riot my feet,\r\n    and writhe to His Heat,\r\n    my tripes.\r\n  So fair!\r\n  With Rum-te-te-Tum\r\n  te Tum,\r\n    And Rum and Tum,\r\n    and Rum-te-te-Tum,\r\n    and Rum-te-te-Tum,\r\n    te Tum.\r\n  So fair!\r\n  This freehold for seraphs free!\r\n    That flame! those skies!\r\n    and Blest is Her Name,\r\n    and blest are my eyes,\r\n    that see.\r\n\r\n\r\n I'll dance,\r\n I'll dance like a ram,\r\n for fun,\r\n   I'll smack the sun,\r\n   I'll dance at the breeze\r\n   I'll dance till I breed\r\n   a son.\r\n For Thou!\r\n Thou bringest Thine ends\r\n to pass:\r\n   This hump so high,\r\n   this lump and her sigh,\r\n   Thou lead'st through the Nee-\r\n   dle's Eye.\r\n 'Tis well\r\n the saurians sprawled,\r\n and roared!\r\n   'Tis well Thou art!\r\n   and well that Thou wast,\r\n   and well when at last\r\n   they soared!\r\n And well,\r\n O well that Thou art\r\n to be\r\n   When seraph hearts\r\n   will laugh by this brook,\r\n   and break for the love\r\n   of Thee.\r\n Thy years\r\n shall still by increase\r\n te Tum,\r\n   And dance and dance,\r\n   With Rum-te-te-Tum....\r\n\r\nso, singing, he danced, and, dancing, sang; and their sounds grew faint;\r\nand they entered into the City of Glory, and their sounds failed....\r\n\r\nThey took him for the Sent of Heaven, nor did the results of his\r\nglorious reign gainsay such a notion: the good Loveday, indeed, had the\r\nagreeable fancy that our greatest are really One, who eternally runs\r\nthe circle of incarnation after incarnation from hoary old ages till\r\nnow--the Ancient of Days, his hair white like wool, quietly turning\r\nup anew when the time yearns, and men are near to yield to the enemy:\r\nProteus his name, and ever the shape he takes is strange, unexpected,\r\nyet ever sharing the same three traits of vision, rage and\r\ngenerousness--the Slayer of the Giant--Arthur come back--the Messenger\r\nof the Covenant--the genius of our species--Jesus the Oft-Born.",
