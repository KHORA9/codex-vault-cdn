For, hitherto, I had been, as it were, wearing costume in\r\nliterature. The rich, figured English of the earlier part of the\r\nseventeenth century had always had a peculiar attraction for me. I\r\naccustomed myself to write in it, to think in it; I kept a diary in that\r\nmanner, and half-unconsciously dressed up my every day thoughts and\r\ncommon experiences in the habit of the Cavalier or of the Caroline\r\nDivine. Thus, when in 1884 I got a commission to translate the\r\nHeptameron, I wrote quite naturally in the language of my favourite\r\nperiod, and, as some critics declare, made my English version somewhat\r\nmore antique and stiff than the original. And so \"The Anatomy of\r\nTobacco\" was an exercise in the antique of a different kind; and \"The\r\nChronicle of Clemendy\" was a volume of tales that tried their hardest to\r\nbe mediaeval; and the translation of the \"Moyen de Parvenir\" was still a\r\nthing in the ancient mode._\r\n\r\n_It seemed, in fine, to be settled that in literature I was to be a\r\nhanger on of the past ages; and I don't quite know how I managed to get\r\naway from them. I had finished translating \"Casanova\"--more modern, but\r\nnot thoroughly up to date--and I had nothing particular on hand, and,\r\nsomehow or other, it struck me that I might try a little writing for the\r\npapers. I began with a \"turnover\" as it was called, for the old vanished\r\nGlobe, a harmless little article on old English proverbs; and I shall\r\nnever forget my pride and delight when one day, being at Dover, with a\r\nfresh autumn wind blowing from the sea, I bought a chance copy of the\r\npaper and saw my essay on the front page. Naturally, I was encouraged to\r\npersevere, and I wrote more turnovers for the Globe and then tried the\r\nSt. James's Gazette and found that they paid two pounds instead of the\r\nguinea of the Globe, and again, naturally enough, devoted most of my\r\nattention to the St. James's Gazette. From the essay or literary paper,\r\nI somehow got into the habit of the short story, and did a good many of\r\nthese, still for the St. James's, till in the autumn of 1890, I wrote a\r\ntale called \"The Double Return.\" Well, Oscar Wilde asked: \"Are you the\r\nauthor of that story that fluttered the dovecotes? I thought it was very\r\ngood.\" But: it did flutter the dovecotes, and the St. James's Gazette\r\nand I parted._\r\n\r\n_But I still wrote short stories, now chiefly for what were called\r\n\"society\" papers, which have become extinct. And one of these appeared\r\nin a paper, the name of which I have long forgotten. I had called the\r\ntale \"Resurrectio Mortuorum,\" and the editor had very sensibly rendered\r\nthe title into \"The Resurrection of the Dead.\"_\r\n\r\n_I do not clearly remember how the story began. I am inclined to think\r\nsomething in this way:_\r\n\r\n_\"Old Mr. Llewellyn, the Welsh antiquary, threw his copy of the morning\r\npaper on the floor and banged the breakfast-table, exclaiming: 'Good\r\nGod! Here's the last of the Caradocs of the Garth, has been married in\r\na Baptist Chapel by a dissenting preacher; somewhere in Peckham.'\" Or,\r\ndid I take up the tale a few years after this happy event and shew the\r\nperfectly cheerful contented young commercial clerk running somewhat too\r\nfast to catch the bus one morning, and feeling dazed all day long over\r\nthe office work, and going home in a sort of dimness, and then at his\r\nvery doorstep, recovering as it were, his ancestral consciousness. I\r\nthink it was the sight of his wife and the tones of her voice that\r\nsuddenly announced to him with the sound of a trumpet that he had\r\nnothing to do with this woman with the Cockney accent, or the pastor who\r\nwas coming to supper, or the red brick villa, or Peckham or the City of\r\nLondon. Though the old place on the banks of the Usk had been sold fifty\r\nyears before, still, he was Caradoc of the Garth. I forget how I ended\r\nthe story: but here was one of the sources of \"A Fragment of Life.\"_\r\n\r\n_And somehow, though the tale was written and printed and paid for; it\r\nstayed with me as a tale half told in the years from 1890 to 1899. I was\r\nin love with the notion: this contrast between the raw London suburb and\r\nits mean limited life and its daily journeys to the City; its utter\r\nbanality and lack of significance; between all this and the old, grey\r\nmullioned house under the forest near the river, the armorial bearings\r\non the Jacobean porch, and noble old traditions: all this captivated me\r\nand I thought of my mistold tale at intervals, while I was writing \"The\r\nGreat God Pan,\" \"The Red Hand,\" \"The Three Impostors,\" \"The Hill of\r\nDreams,\" \"The White People,\" and \"Hieroglyphics.\" It was at the back of\r\nmy head, I suppose, all the time, and at last in '99 I began to write\r\nit all over again from a somewhat different standpoint._\r\n\r\n_The fact was that one grey Sunday afternoon in the March of that year,\r\nI went for a long walk with a friend. I was living in Gray's Inn in\r\nthose days, and we stravaged up Gray's Inn Road on one of those queer,\r\nunscientific explorations of the odd corners of London in which I have\r\nalways delighted. I don't think that there was any definite scheme laid\r\ndown; but we resisted manifold temptations. For on the right of Gray's\r\nInn Road is one of the oddest quarters of London--to those, that is,\r\nwith the unsealed eyes. Here are streets of 1800-1820 that go down into\r\na valley--Flora in \"Little Dorrit\" lived in one of them--and then\r\ncrossing King's Cross Road climb very steeply up to heights which always\r\nsuggest to me that I am in the hinder and poorer quarter of some big\r\nseaside place, and that there is a fine view of the sea from the attic\r\nwindows. This place was once called Spa Fields, and has very properly an\r\nold meeting house of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connection as one of\r\nits attractions. It is one of the parts of London which would attract me\r\nif I wished to hide; not to escape arrest, perhaps, but rather to escape\r\nthe possibility of ever meeting anybody who had ever seen me before._\r\n\r\n_But: my friend and I resisted it all. We strolled along to the parting\r\nof many ways at King's Cross Station, and struck boldly up Pentonville.\r\nAgain: on our left was Barnsbury, which is like Africa. In Barnsbury\r\nsemper aliquid novi, but our course was laid for us by some occult\r\ninfluence, and we came to Islington and chose the right hand side of the\r\nway. So far, we were tolerably in the region of the known, since every\r\nyear there is the great Cattle Show at Islington, and many men go there.\r\nBut, trending to the right, we got into Canonbury, of which there are\r\nonly Travellers' Tales. Now and then, perhaps, as one sits about the\r\nwinter fire, while the storm howls without and the snow falls fast, the\r\nsilent man in the corner has told how he had a great aunt who lived in\r\nCanonbury in 1860; so in the fourteenth century you might meet men who\r\nhad talked with those who had been in Cathay and had seen the splendours\r\nof the Grand Cham. Such is Canonbury; I hardly dare speak of its dim\r\nsquares, of the deep, leafy back-gardens behind the houses, running down\r\ninto obscure alleyways with discreet, mysterious postern doors: as I\r\nsay, \"Travellers' Tales\"; things not much credited._\r\n\r\n_But, he who adventures in London has a foretaste of infinity. There is\r\na region beyond Ultima Thule. I know not how it was, but on this famous\r\nSunday afternoon, my friend and I, passing through Canonbury came into\r\nsomething called the Balls Pond Road--Mr. Perch, the messenger of Dombey\r\n& Son, lived somewhere in this region--and so I think by Dalston down\r\ninto Hackney where caravans, or trams, or, as I think you say in\r\nAmerica, trolley cars set out at stated intervals to the limits of the\r\nwestern world._\r\n\r\n_But in the course of that walk which had become an exploration of the\r\nunknown, I had seen two common things which had made a profound\r\nimpression upon me. One of these things was a street, the other a small\r\nfamily party. The street was somewhere in that vague, uncharted, Balls\r\nPond-Dalston region. It was a long street and a grey street. Each house\r\nwas exactly like every other house. Each house had a basement, the sort\r\nof story which house-agents have grown to call of late a \"lower ground\r\nfloor.\" The front windows of these basements were half above the patch\r\nof black, soot-smeared soil and coarse grass that named itself a garden,\r\nand so, passing along at the hour of four o'clock or four-thirty, I\r\ncould see that in everyone of these \"breakfast rooms\"--their technical\r\nname--the tea tray and the tea cups were set out in readiness. I\r\nreceived from this trivial and natural circumstance an impression of a\r\ndull life, laid out in dreadful lines of patterned uniformity, of a life\r\nwithout adventure of body or soul._\r\n\r\n_Then, the family party. It got into the tram down Hackney way. There\r\nwere father, mother and baby; and I should think that they came from a\r\nsmall shop, probably from a small draper's shop. The parents were young\r\npeople of twenty-five to thirty-five. He wore a black shiny frock\r\ncoat--an \"Albert\" in America?--a high hat, little side whiskers and dark\r\nmoustache and a look of amiable vacuity. His wife was oddly bedizened in\r\nblack satin, with a wide spreading hat, not ill-looking, simply\r\nunmeaning. I fancy that she had at times, not too often, \"a temper of\r\nher own.\" And the very small baby sat upon her knee. The party was\r\nprobably going forth to spend the Sunday evening with relations or\r\nfriends._\r\n\r\n_And yet, I said to myself, these two have partaken together of the\r\ngreat mystery, of the great sacrament of nature, of the source of all\r\nthat is magical in the wide world. But have they discerned the\r\nmysteries? Do they know that they have been in that place which is\r\ncalled Syon and Jerusalem?--I am quoting from an old book and a strange\r\nbook._\r\n\r\n_It was thus that, remembering the old story of the \"Resurrection of the\r\nDead,\" I was furnished with the source of \"A Fragment of Life.\" I was\r\nwriting \"Hieroglyphics\" at the time, having just finished \"The White\r\nPeople\"; or rather, having just decided that what now appears in print\r\nunder that heading was all that would ever be written, that the Great\r\nRomance that should have been written--in manifestation of the\r\nidea--would never be written at all. And so, when Hieroglyphics was\r\nfinished, somewhere about May 1899, I set about \"A Fragment of Life\" and\r\nwrote the first chapter with the greatest relish and the utmost ease.\r\nAnd then my own life was dashed into fragments. I ceased to write. I\r\ntravelled. I saw Syon and Bagdad and other strange places--see \"Things\r\nNear and Far\" for an explanation of this obscure passage--and found\r\nmyself in the lighted world of floats and battens, entering L. U. E.,\r\ncrossing R and exiting R 3; and doing all sorts of queer things._\r\n\r\n_But still, in spite of all these shocks and changes, the \"notion\" would\r\nnot leave me. I went at it again, I suppose in 1904; consumed with a\r\nbitter determination to finish what I had begun. Everything now had\r\nbecome difficult. I tried this way and that way and the other way. They\r\nall failed and I broke down on every one of them; and I tried and tried\r\nagain. At last I cobbled up some sort of an end, an utterly bad one, as\r\nI realized as I wrote every single line and word of it, and the story\r\nappeared, in 1904 or 1905, in Horlick's Magazine under the editorship of\r\nmy old and dear friend, A. E. Waite._\r\n\r\n_Still; I was not satisfied. That end was intolerable and I knew it.\r\nAgain, I sat down to the work, night after night I wrestled with it. And\r\nI remember an odd circumstance which may or may not be of some\r\nphysiological interest. I was then living in a circumscribed \"upper\r\npart\" of a house in Cosway Street, Marylebone Road. That I might\r\nstruggle by myself, I wrote in the little kitchen; and night after night\r\nas I fought grimly, savagely, all but hopelessly for some fit close for\r\n\"A Fragment of Life,\" I was astonished and almost alarmed to find that\r\nmy feet developed a sensation of most deadly cold. The room was not\r\ncold; I had lit the oven burners of the little gas cooking stove. I was\r\nnot cold; but my feet were chilled in a quite extraordinary manner, as\r\nif they had been packed in ice. At last I took off my slippers with a\r\nview of poking my toes into the oven of the stove, and feeling my feet\r\nwith my hand, I perceived that, in fact, they were not cold at all! But\r\nthe sensation remained; there, I suppose, you have an odd case of a\r\ntransference of something that was happening in the brain to the\r\nextremities. My feet were quite warm to the palm of my hand, but to my\r\nsense they were frozen. But what a testimony to the fitness of the\r\nAmerican idiom, \"cold feet,\" as signifying a depressed and desponding\r\nmood! But, somehow or other, the tale was finished and the \"notion\" was\r\nat last out of my head. I have gone into all this detail about \"A\r\nFragment of Life\" because I have been assured in many quarters that it\r\nis the best thing that I have ever done, and students of the crooked\r\nways of literature may be interested to hear of the abominable labours\r\nof doing it._\r\n\r\n_\"The White People\" belongs to the same year as the first chapter of \"A\r\nFragment of Life,\" 1899, which was also the year of \"Hieroglyphics.\" The\r\nfact was I was in high literary spirits, just then. I had been harassed\r\nand worried for a whole year in the office of Literature, a weekly paper\r\npublished by The Times, and getting free again, I felt like a prisoner\r\nreleased from chains; ready to dance in letters to any extent. Forthwith\r\nI thought of \"A Great Romance,\" a highly elaborate and elaborated piece\r\nof work, full of the strangest and rarest things. I have forgotten how\r\nit was that this design broke down; but I found by experiment that the\r\ngreat romance was to go on that brave shelf of the unwritten books, the\r\nshelf where all the splendid books are to be found in their golden\r\nbindings. \"The White People\" is a small piece of salvage from the wreck.\r\nOddly enough, as is insinuated in the Prologue, the mainspring of the\r\nstory is to be sought in a medical textbook. In the Prologue reference\r\nis made to a review article by Dr. Coryn. But I have since found out\r\nthat Dr. Coryn was merely quoting from a scientific treatise that case\r\nof the lady whose fingers became violently inflamed because she saw a\r\nheavy window sash descend on the fingers of her child. With this\r\ninstance, of course, are to be considered all cases of stigmata, both\r\nancient and modern: and then the question is obvious enough: what limits\r\ncan we place to the powers of the imagination? Has not the imagination\r\nthe potentiality at least of performing any miracle, however marvelous,\r\nhowever incredible, according to our ordinary standards? As to the\r\ndecoration of the story, that is a mingling which I venture to think\r\nsomewhat ingenious of odds and ends of folk lore and witch lore with\r\npure inventions of my own. Some years later I was amused to receive a\r\nletter from a gentleman who was, if I remember, a schoolmaster somewhere\r\nin Malaya. This gentleman, an earnest student of folklore, was writing\r\nan article on some singular things he had observed amongst the Malayans,\r\nand chiefly a kind of were-wolf state into which some of them were able\r\nto conjure themselves. He had found, as he said, startling resemblances\r\nbetween the magic ritual of Malaya and some of the ceremonies and\r\npractices hinted at in \"The White People.\" He presumed that all this was\r\nnot fancy but fact; that is that I was describing practices actually in\r\nuse among superstitious people on the Welsh border; he was going to\r\nquote from me in the article for the Journal of the Folk Lore Society,\r\nor whatever it was called, and he just wanted to let me know. I wrote in\r\na hurry to the folklore journal to bid them beware: for the instances\r\nselected by the student were all fictions of my own brain!_\r\n\r\n_\"The Great God Pan\" and \"The Inmost Light\" are tales of an earlier\r\ndate, going back to 1890, '91, '92. I have written a good deal about\r\nthem in \"Far Off Things,\" and in a preface to an edition of \"The Great\r\nGod Pan,\" published by Messrs. Simpkin, Marshall in 1916, I have\r\ndescribed at length the origins of the book. But I must quote anew some\r\nextracts from the reviews which welcomed \"The Great God Pan\" to my\r\nextraordinary entertainment, hilarity and refreshment. Here are a few of\r\nthe best:_\r\n\r\n_\"It is not Mr. Machen's fault but his misfortune, that one shakes with\r\nlaughter rather than with dread over the contemplation of his\r\npsychological bogey.\"--Observer._\r\n\r\n_\"His horror, we regret to say, leaves us quite cold ... and our flesh\r\nobstinately refuses to creep.\"--Chronicle._\r\n\r\n_\"His bogies don't scare.\"--Sketch._\r\n\r\n_\"We are afraid he only succeeds in being ridiculous.\"--Manchester\r\nGuardian._\r\n\r\n_\"Gruesome, ghastly and dull.\"--Lady's Pictorial._\r\n\r\n_\"Incoherent nightmare of sex ... which would soon lead to insanity if\r\nunrestrained ... innocuous from its absurdity.\"--Westminster Gazette._\r\n\r\n_And so on, and so on. Several papers, I remember, declared that \"The\r\nGreat God Pan\" was simply a stupid and incompetent rehash of Huysmans'\r\n\"La-Bas\" and \"A Rebours.\" I had not read these books so I got them both.\r\nThereon, I perceived that my critics had not read them either._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Fragment of Life\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nEdward Darnell awoke from a dream of an ancient wood, and of a clear\r\nwell rising into grey film and vapour beneath a misty, glimmering heat;\r\nand as his eyes opened he saw the sunlight bright in the room, sparkling\r\non the varnish of the new furniture. He turned and found his wife's\r\nplace vacant, and with some confusion and wonder of the dream still\r\nlingering in his mind, he rose also, and began hurriedly to set about\r\nhis dressing, for he had overslept a little, and the 'bus passed the\r\ncorner at 9.15. He was a tall, thin man, dark-haired and dark-eyed, and\r\nin spite of the routine of the City, the counting of coupons, and all\r\nthe mechanical drudgery that had lasted for ten years, there still\r\nremained about him the curious hint of a wild grace, as if he had been\r\nborn a creature of the antique wood, and had seen the fountain rising\r\nfrom the green moss and the grey rocks.\r\n\r\nThe breakfast was laid in the room on the ground floor, the back room\r\nwith the French windows looking on the garden, and before he sat down to\r\nhis fried bacon he kissed his wife seriously and dutifully. She had\r\nbrown hair and brown eyes, and though her lovely face was grave and\r\nquiet, one would have said that she might have awaited her husband under\r\nthe old trees, and bathed in the pool hollowed out of the rocks.\r\n\r\nThey had a good deal to talk over while the coffee was poured out and\r\nthe bacon eaten, and Darnell's egg brought in by the stupid, staring\r\nservant-girl of the dusty face. They had been married for a year, and\r\nthey had got on excellently, rarely sitting silent for more than an\r\nhour, but for the past few weeks Aunt Marian's present had afforded a\r\nsubject for conversation which seemed inexhaustible. Mrs. Darnell had\r\nbeen Miss Mary Reynolds, the daughter of an auctioneer and estate agent\r\nin Notting Hill, and Aunt Marian was her mother's sister, who was\r\nsupposed rather to have lowered herself by marrying a coal merchant, in\r\na small way, at Turnham Green. Marian had felt the family attitude a\r\ngood deal, and the Reynoldses were sorry for many things that had been\r\nsaid, when the coal merchant saved money and took up land on building\r\nleases in the neighbourhood of Crouch End, greatly to his advantage, as\r\nit appeared. Nobody had thought that Nixon could ever do very much; but\r\nhe and his wife had been living for years in a beautiful house at\r\nBarnet, with bow-windows, shrubs, and a paddock, and the two families\r\nsaw but little of each other, for Mr. Reynolds was not very prosperous.\r\nOf course, Aunt Marian and her husband had been asked to Mary's wedding,\r\nbut they had sent excuses with a nice little set of silver apostle\r\nspoons, and it was feared that nothing more was to be looked for.\r\nHowever, on Mary's birthday her aunt had written a most affectionate\r\nletter, enclosing a cheque for a hundred pounds from 'Robert' and\r\nherself, and ever since the receipt of the money the Darnells had\r\ndiscussed the question of its judicious disposal. Mrs. Darnell had\r\nwished to invest the whole sum in Government securities, but Mr. Darnell\r\nhad pointed out that the rate of interest was absurdly low, and after a\r\ngood deal of talk he had persuaded his wife to put ninety pounds of the\r\nmoney in a safe mine, which was paying five per cent. This was very\r\nwell, but the remaining ten pounds, which Mrs. Darnell had insisted on\r\nreserving, gave rise to legends and discourses as interminable as the\r\ndisputes of the schools.\r\n\r\nAt first Mr. Darnell had proposed that they should furnish the 'spare'\r\nroom. There were four bedrooms in the house: their own room, the small\r\none for the servant, and two others overlooking the garden, one of which\r\nhad been used for storing boxes, ends of rope, and odd numbers of 'Quiet\r\nDays' and 'Sunday Evenings,' besides some worn suits belonging to Mr.\r\nDarnell which had been carefully wrapped up and laid by, as he scarcely\r\nknew what to do with them. The other room was frankly waste and vacant,\r\nand one Saturday afternoon, as he was coming home in the 'bus, and while\r\nhe revolved that difficult question of the ten pounds, the unseemly\r\nemptiness of the spare room suddenly came into his mind, and he glowed\r\nwith the idea that now, thanks to Aunt Marian, it could be furnished. He\r\nwas busied with this delightful thought all the way home, but when he\r\nlet himself in, he said nothing to his wife, since he felt that his idea\r\nmust be matured. He told Mrs. Darnell that, having important business,\r\nhe was obliged to go out again directly, but that he should be back\r\nwithout fail for tea at half-past six; and Mary, on her side, was not\r\nsorry to be alone, as she was a little behindhand with the household\r\nbooks. The fact was, that Darnell, full of the design of furnishing the\r\nspare bedroom, wished to consult his friend Wilson, who lived at\r\nFulham, and had often given him judicious advice as to the laying out of\r\nmoney to the very best advantage. Wilson was connected with the Bordeaux\r\nwine trade, and Darnell's only anxiety was lest he should not be at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was all right; Darnell took a tram along the Goldhawk Road,\r\nand walked the rest of the way, and was delighted to see Wilson in the\r\nfront garden of his house, busy amongst his flower-beds.\r\n\r\n'Haven't seen you for an age,' he said cheerily, when he heard Darnell's\r\nhand on the gate; 'come in. Oh, I forgot,' he added, as Darnell still\r\nfumbled with the handle, and vainly attempted to enter. 'Of course you\r\ncan't get in; I haven't shown it you.'\r\n\r\nIt was a hot day in June, and Wilson appeared in a costume which he had\r\nput on in haste as soon as he arrived from the City. He wore a straw hat\r\nwith a neat pugaree protecting the back of his neck, and his dress was a\r\nNorfolk jacket and knickers in heather mixture.\r\n\r\n'See,' he said, as he let Darnell in; 'see the dodge. You don't _turn_\r\nthe handle at all. First of all push hard, and then pull. It's a trick\r\nof my own, and I shall have it patented. You see, it keeps undesirable\r\ncharacters at a distance--such a great thing in the suburbs. I feel I\r\ncan leave Mrs. Wilson alone now; and, formerly, you have no idea how she\r\nused to be pestered.'\r\n\r\n'But how about visitors?' said Darnell. 'How do they get in?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, we put them up to it. Besides,' he said vaguely, 'there is sure to\r\nbe somebody looking out. Mrs. Wilson is nearly always at the window.\r\nShe's out now; gone to call on some friends. The Bennetts' At Home day,\r\nI think it is. This is the first Saturday, isn't it? You know J. W.\r\nBennett, don't you? Ah, he's in the House; doing very well, I believe.\r\nHe put me on to a very good thing the other day.'\r\n\r\n'But, I say,' said Wilson, as they turned and strolled towards the front\r\ndoor, 'what do you wear those black things for? You look hot. Look at\r\nme. Well, I've been gardening, you know, but I feel as cool as a\r\ncucumber. I dare say you don't know where to get these things? Very few\r\nmen do. Where do you suppose I got 'em?'\r\n\r\n'In the West End, I suppose,' said Darnell, wishing to be polite.\r\n\r\n'Yes, that's what everybody says. And it is a good cut. Well, I'll tell\r\nyou, but you needn't pass it on to everybody. I got the tip from\r\nJameson--you know him, \"Jim-Jams,\" in the China trade, 39 Eastbrook--and\r\nhe said he didn't want everybody in the City to know about it. But just\r\ngo to Jennings, in Old Wall, and mention my name, and you'll be all\r\nright. And what d'you think they cost?'\r\n\r\n'I haven't a notion,' said Darnell, who had never bought such a suit in\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n'Well, have a guess.'\r\n\r\nDarnell regarded Wilson gravely.\r\n\r\nThe jacket hung about his body like a sack, the knickerbockers drooped\r\nlamentably over his calves, and in prominent positions the bloom of the\r\nheather seemed about to fade and disappear.\r\n\r\n'Three pounds, I suppose, at least,' he said at length.\r\n\r\n'Well, I asked Dench, in our place, the other day, and he guessed four\r\nten, and his father's got something to do with a big business in Conduit\r\nStreet. But I only gave thirty-five and six. To measure? Of course; look\r\nat the cut, man.'\r\n\r\nDarnell was astonished at so low a price.\r\n\r\n'And, by the way,' Wilson went on, pointing to his new brown boots, 'you\r\nknow where to go for shoe-leather? Oh, I thought everybody was up to\r\nthat! There's only one place. \"Mr. Bill,\" in Gunning Street,--nine and\r\nsix.'\r\n\r\nThey were walking round and round the garden, and Wilson pointed out the\r\nflowers in the beds and borders. There were hardly any blossoms, but\r\neverything was neatly arranged.\r\n\r\n'Here are the tuberous-rooted Glasgownias,' he said, showing a rigid row\r\nof stunted plants; 'those are Squintaceae; this is a new introduction,\r\nMoldavia Semperflorida Andersonii; and this is Prattsia.'\r\n\r\n'When do they come out?' said Darnell.\r\n\r\n'Most of them in the end of August or beginning of September,' said\r\nWilson briefly. He was slightly annoyed with himself for having talked\r\nso much about his plants, since he saw that Darnell cared nothing for\r\nflowers; and, indeed, the visitor could hardly dissemble vague\r\nrecollections that came to him; thoughts of an old, wild garden, full of\r\nodours, beneath grey walls, of the fragrance of the meadowsweet beside\r\nthe brook.\r\n\r\n'I wanted to consult you about some furniture,' Darnell said at last.\r\n'You know we've got a spare room, and I'm thinking of putting a few\r\nthings into it. I haven't exactly made up my mind, but I thought you\r\nmight advise me.'\r\n\r\n'Come into my den,' said Wilson. 'No; this way, by the back'; and he\r\nshowed Darnell another ingenious arrangement at the side door whereby a\r\nviolent high-toned bell was set pealing in the house if one did but\r\ntouch the latch. Indeed, Wilson handled it so briskly that the bell rang\r\na wild alarm, and the servant, who was trying on her mistress's things\r\nin the bedroom, jumped madly to the window and then danced a hysteric\r\ndance. There was plaster found on the drawing-room table on Sunday\r\nafternoon, and Wilson wrote a letter to the 'Fulham Chronicle,'\r\nascribing the phenomenon 'to some disturbance of a seismic nature.'\r\n\r\nFor the moment he knew nothing of the great results of his contrivance,\r\nand solemnly led the way towards the back of the house. Here there was a\r\npatch of turf, beginning to look a little brown, with a background of\r\nshrubs. In the middle of the turf, a boy of nine or ten was standing all\r\nalone, with something of an air.\r\n\r\n'The eldest,' said Wilson. 'Havelock. Well, Lockie, what are ye doing\r\nnow? And where are your brother and sister?'\r\n\r\nThe boy was not at all shy. Indeed, he seemed eager to explain the\r\ncourse of events.\r\n\r\n'I'm playing at being Gawd,' he said, with an engaging frankness. 'And\r\nI've sent Fergus and Janet to the bad place. That's in the shrubbery.\r\nAnd they're never to come out any more. And they're burning for ever and\r\never.'\r\n\r\n'What d'you think of that?' said Wilson admiringly. 'Not bad for a\r\nyoungster of nine, is it? They think a lot of him at the Sunday-school.\r\nBut come into my den.'\r\n\r\nThe den was an apartment projecting from the back of the house. It had\r\nbeen designed as a back kitchen and washhouse, but Wilson had draped the\r\n'copper' in art muslin and had boarded over the sink, so that it served\r\nas a workman's bench.\r\n\r\n'Snug, isn't it?' he said, as he pushed forward one of the two wicker\r\nchairs. 'I think out things here, you know; it's quiet. And what about\r\nthis furnishing? Do you want to do the thing on a grand scale?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, not at all. Quite the reverse. In fact, I don't know whether the\r\nsum at our disposal will be sufficient. You see the spare room is ten\r\nfeet by twelve, with a western exposure, and I thought if we _could_\r\nmanage it, that it would seem more cheerful furnished. Besides, it's\r\npleasant to be able to ask a visitor; our aunt, Mrs. Nixon, for example.\r\nBut she is accustomed to have everything very nice.'\r\n\r\n'And how much do you want to spend?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I hardly think we should be justified in going much beyond ten\r\npounds. That isn't enough, eh?'\r\n\r\nWilson got up and shut the door of the back kitchen impressively.\r\n\r\n'Look here,' he said, 'I'm glad you came to me in the first place. Now\r\nyou'll just tell me where you thought of going yourself.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I had thought of the Hampstead Road,' said Darnell in a\r\nhesitating manner.\r\n\r\n'I just thought you'd say that. But I'll ask you, what is the good of\r\ngoing to those expensive shops in the West End? You don't get a better\r\narticle for your money. You're merely paying for fashion.'\r\n\r\n'I've seen some nice things in Samuel's, though. They get a brilliant\r\npolish on their goods in those superior shops. We went there when we\r\nwere married.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly, and paid ten per cent more than you need have paid. It's\r\nthrowing money away. And how much did you say you had to spend? Ten\r\npounds. Well, I can tell you where to get a beautiful bedroom suite, in\r\nthe very highest finish, for six pound ten. What d'you think of that?\r\nChina included, mind you; and a square of carpet, brilliant colours,\r\nwill only cost you fifteen and six. Look here, go any Saturday afternoon\r\nto Dick's, in the Seven Sisters Road, mention my name, and ask for Mr.\r\nJohnston. The suite's in ash, \"Elizabethan\" they call it. Six pound ten,\r\nincluding the china, with one of their \"Orient\" carpets, nine by nine,\r\nfor fifteen and six. Dick's.'\r\n\r\nWilson spoke with some eloquence on the subject of furnishing. He\r\npointed out that the times were changed, and that the old heavy style\r\nwas quite out of date.\r\n\r\n'You know,' he said, 'it isn't like it was in the old days, when people\r\nused to buy things to last hundreds of years. Why, just before the wife\r\nand I were married, an uncle of mine died up in the North and left me\r\nhis furniture. I was thinking of furnishing at the time, and I thought\r\nthe things might come in handy; but I assure you there wasn't a single\r\narticle that I cared to give house-room to. All dingy, old mahogany; big\r\nbookcases and bureaus, and claw-legged chairs and tables. As I said to\r\nthe wife (as she was soon afterwards), \"We don't exactly want to set up\r\na chamber of horrors, do we?\" So I sold off the lot for what I could\r\nget. I must confess I like a cheerful room.'\r\n\r\nDarnell said he had heard that artists liked the old-fashioned\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I dare say. The \"unclean cult of the sunflower,\" eh? You saw that\r\npiece in the \"Daily Post\"? I hate all that rot myself. It isn't healthy,\r\nyou know, and I don't believe the English people will stand it. But\r\ntalking of curiosities, I've got something here that's worth a bit of\r\nmoney.'\r\n\r\nHe dived into some dusty receptacle in a corner of the room, and showed\r\nDarnell a small, worm-eaten Bible, wanting the first five chapters of\r\nGenesis and the last leaf of the Apocalypse. It bore the date of 1753.\r\n\r\n'It's my belief that's worth a lot,' said Wilson. 'Look at the\r\nworm-holes. And you see it's \"imperfect,\" as they call it. You've\r\nnoticed that some of the most valuable books are \"imperfect\" at the\r\nsales?'\r\n\r\nThe interview came to an end soon after, and Darnell went home to his\r\ntea. He thought seriously of taking Wilson's advice, and after tea he\r\ntold Mary of his idea and of what Wilson had said about Dick's.\r\n\r\nMary was a good deal taken by the plan when she had heard all the\r\ndetails. The prices struck her as very moderate. They were sitting one\r\non each side of the grate (which was concealed by a pretty cardboard\r\nscreen, painted with landscapes), and she rested her cheek on her hand,\r\nand her beautiful dark eyes seemed to dream and behold strange visions.\r\nIn reality she was thinking of Darnell's plan.\r\n\r\n'It would be very nice in some ways,' she said at last. 'But we must\r\ntalk it over. What I am afraid of is that it will come to much more than\r\nten pounds in the long run. There are so many things to be considered.\r\nThere's the bed. It would look shabby if we got a common bed without\r\nbrass mounts. Then the bedding, the mattress, and blankets, and sheets,\r\nand counterpane would all cost something.'\r\n\r\nShe dreamed again, calculating the cost of all the necessaries, and\r\nDarnell stared anxiously; reckoning with her, and wondering what her\r\nconclusion would be. For a moment the delicate colouring of her face,\r\nthe grace of her form, and the brown hair, drooping over her ears and\r\nclustering in little curls about her neck, seemed to hint at a language\r\nwhich he had not yet learned; but she spoke again.\r\n\r\n'The bedding would come to a great deal, I am afraid. Even if Dick's are\r\nconsiderably cheaper than Boon's or Samuel's. And, my dear, we must have\r\nsome ornaments on the mantelpiece. I saw some very nice vases at\r\neleven-three the other day at Wilkin and Dodd's. We should want six at\r\nleast, and there ought to be a centre-piece. You see how it mounts up.'\r\n\r\nDarnell was silent. He saw that his wife was summing up against his\r\nscheme, and though he had set his heart on it, he could not resist her\r\narguments.\r\n\r\n'It would be nearer twelve pounds than ten,' she said.\r\n\r\n'The floor would have to be stained round the carpet (nine by nine, you\r\nsaid?), and we should want a piece of linoleum to go under the\r\nwashstand. And the walls would look very bare without any pictures.'\r\n\r\n'I thought about the pictures,' said Darnell; and he spoke quite\r\neagerly. He felt that here, at least, he was unassailable. 'You know\r\nthere's the \"Derby Day\" and the \"Railway Station,\" ready framed,\r\nstanding in the corner of the box-room already. They're a bit\r\nold-fashioned, perhaps, but that doesn't matter in a bedroom. And\r\ncouldn't we use some photographs? I saw a very neat frame in natural oak\r\nin the City, to hold half a dozen, for one and six. We might put in your\r\nfather, and your brother James, and Aunt Marian, and your grandmother,\r\nin her widow's cap--and any of the others in the album. And then there's\r\nthat old family picture in the hair-trunk--that might do over the\r\nmantelpiece.'\r\n\r\n'You mean your great-grandfather in the gilt frame? But that's _very_\r\nold-fashioned, isn't it? He looks so queer in his wig. I don't think it\r\nwould quite go with the room, somehow.'\r\n\r\nDarnell thought a moment. The portrait was a 'kitcat' of a young\r\ngentleman, bravely dressed in the fashion of 1750, and he very faintly\r\nremembered some old tales that his father had told him about this\r\nancestor--tales of the woods and fields, of the deep sunken lanes, and\r\nthe forgotten country in the west.\r\n\r\n'No,' he said, 'I suppose it is rather out of date. But I saw some very\r\nnice prints in the City, framed and quite cheap.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but everything counts. Well, we will talk it over, as you say. You\r\nknow we must be careful.'\r\n\r\nThe servant came in with the supper, a tin of biscuits, a glass of milk\r\nfor the mistress, and a modest pint of beer for the master, with a\r\nlittle cheese and butter. Afterwards Edward smoked two pipes of\r\nhoneydew, and they went quietly to bed; Mary going first, and her\r\nhusband following a quarter of an hour later, according to the ritual\r\nestablished from the first days of their marriage. Front and back doors\r\nwere locked, the gas was turned off at the meter, and when Darnell got\r\nupstairs he found his wife already in bed, her face turned round on the\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nShe spoke softly to him as he came into the room.\r\n\r\n'It would be impossible to buy a presentable bed at anything under one\r\npound eleven, and good sheets are dear, anywhere.'\r\n\r\nHe slipped off his clothes and slid gently into bed, putting out the\r\ncandle on the table. The blinds were all evenly and duly drawn, but it\r\nwas a June night, and beyond the walls, beyond that desolate world and\r\nwilderness of grey Shepherd's Bush, a great golden moon had floated up\r\nthrough magic films of cloud, above the hill, and the earth was filled\r\nwith a wonderful light between red sunset lingering over the mountain\r\nand that marvellous glory that shone into the woods from the summit of\r\nthe hill. Darnell seemed to see some reflection of that wizard\r\nbrightness in the room; the pale walls and the white bed and his wife's\r\nface lying amidst brown hair upon the pillow were illuminated, and\r\nlistening he could almost hear the corncrake in the fields, the fern-owl\r\nsounding his strange note from the quiet of the rugged place where the\r\nbracken grew, and, like the echo of a magic song, the melody of the\r\nnightingale that sang all night in the alder by the little brook. There\r\nwas nothing that he could say, but he slowly stole his arm under his\r\nwife's neck, and played with the ringlets of brown hair. She never\r\nmoved, she lay there gently breathing, looking up to the blank ceiling\r\nof the room with her beautiful eyes, thinking also, no doubt, thoughts\r\nthat she could not utter, kissing her husband obediently when he asked\r\nher to do so, and he stammered and hesitated as he spoke.\r\n\r\nThey were nearly asleep, indeed Darnell was on the very eve of dreaming,\r\nwhen she said very softly--\r\n\r\n'I am afraid, darling, that we could never afford it.' And he heard her\r\nwords through the murmur of the water, dripping from the grey rock, and\r\nfalling into the clear pool beneath.\r\n\r\nSunday morning was always an occasion of idleness. Indeed, they would\r\nnever have got breakfast if Mrs. Darnell, who had the instincts of the\r\nhousewife, had not awoke and seen the bright sunshine, and felt that the\r\nhouse was too still. She lay quiet for five minutes, while her husband\r\nslept beside her, and listened intently, waiting for the sound of Alice\r\nstirring down below. A golden tube of sunlight shone through some\r\nopening in the Venetian blinds, and it shone on the brown hair that lay\r\nabout her head on the pillow, and she looked steadily into the room at\r\nthe 'duchesse' toilet-table, the coloured ware of the washstand, and the\r\ntwo photogravures in oak frames, 'The Meeting' and 'The Parting,' that\r\nhung upon the wall. She was half dreaming as she listened for the\r\nservant's footsteps, and the faint shadow of a shade of a thought came\r\nover her, and she imagined dimly, for the quick moment of a dream,\r\nanother world where rapture was wine, where one wandered in a deep and\r\nhappy valley, and the moon was always rising red above the trees. She\r\nwas thinking of Hampstead, which represented to her the vision of the\r\nworld beyond the walls, and the thought of the heath led her away to\r\nBank Holidays, and then to Alice. There was not a sound in the house; it\r\nmight have been midnight for the stillness if the drawling cry of the\r\nSunday paper had not suddenly echoed round the corner of Edna Road, and\r\nwith it came the warning clank and shriek of the milkman with his pails.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darnell sat up, and wide awake, listened more intently. The girl\r\nwas evidently fast asleep, and must be roused, or all the work of the\r\nday would be out of joint, and she remembered how Edward hated any fuss\r\nor discussion about household matters, more especially on a Sunday,\r\nafter his long week's work in the City. She gave her husband an\r\naffectionate glance as he slept on, for she was very fond of him, and so\r\nshe gently rose from the bed and went in her nightgown to call the maid.\r\n\r\nThe servant's room was small and stuffy, the night had been very hot,\r\nand Mrs. Darnell paused for a moment at the door, wondering whether the\r\ngirl on the bed was really the dusty-faced servant who bustled day by\r\nday about the house, or even the strangely bedizened creature, dressed\r\nin purple, with a shiny face, who would appear on the Sunday afternoon,\r\nbringing in an early tea, because it was her 'evening out.' Alice's hair\r\nwas black and her skin was pale, almost of the olive tinge, and she lay\r\nasleep, her head resting on one arm, reminding Mrs. Darnell of a queer\r\nprint of a 'Tired Bacchante' that she had seen long ago in a shop window\r\nin Upper Street, Islington. And a cracked bell was ringing; that meant\r\nfive minutes to eight, and nothing done.\r\n\r\nShe touched the girl gently on the shoulder, and only smiled when her\r\neyes opened, and waking with a start, she got up in sudden confusion.\r\nMrs. Darnell went back to her room and dressed slowly while her husband\r\nstill slept, and it was only at the last moment, as she fastened her\r\ncherry-coloured bodice, that she roused him, telling him that the bacon\r\nwould be overdone unless he hurried over his dressing.\r\n\r\nOver the breakfast they discussed the question of the spare room all\r\nover again. Mrs. Darnell still admitted that the plan of furnishing it\r\nattracted her, but she could not see how it could be done for the ten\r\npounds, and as they were prudent people they did not care to encroach on\r\ntheir savings. Edward was highly paid, having (with allowances for extra\r\nwork in busy weeks) a hundred and forty pounds a year, and Mary had\r\ninherited from an old uncle, her godfather, three hundred pounds, which\r\nhad been judiciously laid out in mortgage at 4-1/2 per cent. Their total\r\nincome, then, counting in Aunt Marian's present, was a hundred and\r\nfifty-eight pounds a year, and they were clear of debt, since Darnell\r\nhad bought the furniture for the house out of money which he had saved\r\nfor five or six years before. In the first few years of his life in the\r\nCity his income had, of course, been smaller, and at first he had lived\r\nvery freely, without a thought of laying by. The theatres and\r\nmusic-halls had attracted him, and scarcely a week passed without his\r\ngoing (in the pit) to one or the other; and he had occasionally bought\r\nphotographs of actresses who pleased him. These he had solemnly burnt\r\nwhen he became engaged to Mary; he remembered the evening well; his\r\nheart had been so full of joy and wonder, and the landlady had\r\ncomplained bitterly of the mess in the grate when he came home from the\r\nCity the next night. Still, the money was lost, as far as he could\r\nrecollect, ten or twelve shillings; and it annoyed him all the more to\r\nreflect that if he had put it by, it would have gone far towards the\r\npurchase of an 'Orient' carpet in brilliant colours. Then there had been\r\nother expenses of his youth: he had purchased threepenny and even\r\nfourpenny cigars, the latter rarely, but the former frequently,\r\nsometimes singly, and sometimes in bundles of twelve for half-a-crown.\r\nOnce a meerschaum pipe had haunted him for six weeks; the tobacconist\r\nhad drawn it out of a drawer with some air of secrecy as he was buying a\r\npacket of 'Lone Star.' Here was another useless expense, these\r\nAmerican-manufactured tobaccos; his 'Lone Star,' 'Long Judge,' 'Old\r\nHank,' 'Sultry Clime,' and the rest of them cost from a shilling to one\r\nand six the two-ounce packet; whereas now he got excellent loose\r\nhoneydew for threepence halfpenny an ounce. But the crafty tradesman,\r\nwho had marked him down as a buyer of expensive fancy goods, nodded with\r\nhis air of mystery, and, snapping open the case, displayed the\r\nmeerschaum before the dazzled eyes of Darnell. The bowl was carved in\r\nthe likeness of a female figure, showing the head and _torso_, and the\r\nmouthpiece was of the very best amber--only twelve and six, the man\r\nsaid, and the amber alone, he declared, was worth more than that. He\r\nexplained that he felt some delicacy about showing the pipe to any but a\r\nregular customer, and was willing to take a little under cost price and\r\n'cut the loss.' Darnell resisted for the time, but the pipe troubled\r\nhim, and at last he bought it. He was pleased to show it to the younger\r\nmen in the office for a while, but it never smoked very well, and he\r\ngave it away just before his marriage, as from the nature of the carving\r\nit would have been impossible to use it in his wife's presence. Once,\r\nwhile he was taking his holidays at Hastings, he had purchased a malacca\r\ncane--a useless thing that had cost seven shillings--and he reflected\r\nwith sorrow on the innumerable evenings on which he had rejected his\r\nlandlady's plain fried chop, and had gone out to _flaner_ among the\r\nItalian restaurants in Upper Street, Islington (he lodged in Holloway),\r\npampering himself with expensive delicacies: cutlets and green peas,\r\nbraised beef with tomato sauce, fillet steak and chipped potatoes,\r\nending the banquet very often with a small wedge of Gruyere, which cost\r\ntwopence. One night, after receiving a rise in his salary, he had\r\nactually drunk a quarter-flask of Chianti and had added the enormities\r\nof Benedictine, coffee, and cigarettes to an expenditure already\r\ndisgraceful, and sixpence to the waiter made the bill amount to four\r\nshillings instead of the shilling that would have provided him with a\r\nwholesome and sufficient repast at home. Oh, there were many other items\r\nin this account of extravagance, and Darnell had often regretted his way\r\nof life, thinking that if he had been more careful, five or six pounds a\r\nyear might have been added to their income.\r\n\r\nAnd the question of the spare room brought back these regrets in an\r\nexaggerated degree. He persuaded himself that the extra five pounds\r\nwould have given a sufficient margin for the outlay that he desired to\r\nmake; though this was, no doubt, a mistake on his part. But he saw\r\nquite clearly that, under the present conditions, there must be no\r\nlevies made on the very small sum of money that they had saved. The rent\r\nof the house was thirty-five, and rates and taxes added another ten\r\npounds--nearly a quarter of their income for house-room. Mary kept down\r\nthe housekeeping bills to the very best of her ability, but meat was\r\nalways dear, and she suspected the maid of cutting surreptitious slices\r\nfrom the joint and eating them in her bedroom with bread and treacle in\r\nthe dead of night, for the girl had disordered and eccentric appetites.\r\nMr. Darnell thought no more of restaurants, cheap or dear; he took his\r\nlunch with him to the City, and joined his wife in the evening at high\r\ntea--chops, a bit of steak, or cold meat from the Sunday's dinner. Mrs.\r\nDarnell ate bread and jam and drank a little milk in the middle of the\r\nday; but, with the utmost economy, the effort to live within their means\r\nand to save for future contingencies was a very hard one. They had\r\ndetermined to do without change of air for at least three years, as the\r\nhoneymoon at Walton-on-the-Naze had cost a good deal; and it was on this\r\nground that they had, somewhat illogically, reserved the ten pounds,\r\ndeclaring that as they were not to have any holiday they would spend the\r\nmoney on something useful.\r\n\r\nAnd it was this consideration of utility that was finally fatal to\r\nDarnell's scheme. They had calculated and recalculated the expense of\r\nthe bed and bedding, the linoleum, and the ornaments, and by a great\r\ndeal of exertion the total expenditure had been made to assume the shape\r\nof 'something very little over ten pounds,' when Mary said quite\r\nsuddenly--\r\n\r\n'But, after all, Edward, we don't really _want_ to furnish the room at\r\nall. I mean it isn't necessary. And if we did so it might lead to no end\r\nof expense. People would hear of it and be sure to fish for invitations.\r\nYou know we have relatives in the country, and they would be almost\r\ncertain, the Mallings, at any rate, to give hints.'\r\n\r\nDarnell saw the force of the argument and gave way. But he was bitterly\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\n'It would have been very nice, wouldn't it?' he said with a sigh.\r\n\r\n'Never mind, dear,' said Mary, who saw that he was a good deal cast\r\ndown. 'We must think of some other plan that will be nice and useful\r\ntoo.'\r\n\r\nShe often spoke to him in that tone of a kind mother, though she was by\r\nthree years the younger.\r\n\r\n'And now,' she said, 'I must get ready for church. Are you coming?'\r\n\r\nDarnell said that he thought not. He usually accompanied his wife to\r\nmorning service, but that day he felt some bitterness in his heart, and\r\npreferred to lounge under the shade of the big mulberry tree that stood\r\nin the middle of their patch of garden--relic of the spacious lawns that\r\nhad once lain smooth and green and sweet, where the dismal streets now\r\nswarmed in a hopeless labyrinth.\r\n\r\nSo Mary went quietly and alone to church. St. Paul's stood in a\r\nneighbouring street, and its Gothic design would have interested a\r\ncurious inquirer into the history of a strange revival. Obviously,\r\nmechanically, there was nothing amiss. The style chosen was 'geometrical\r\ndecorated,' and the tracery of the windows seemed correct. The nave, the\r\naisles, the spacious chancel, were reasonably proportioned; and, to be\r\nquite serious, the only feature obviously wrong was the substitution of\r\na low 'chancel wall' with iron gates for the rood screen with the loft\r\nand rood. But this, it might plausibly be contended, was merely an\r\nadaptation of the old idea to modern requirements, and it would have\r\nbeen quite difficult to explain why the whole building, from the mere\r\nmortar setting between the stones to the Gothic gas standards, was a\r\nmysterious and elaborate blasphemy. The canticles were sung to Joll in B\r\nflat, the chants were 'Anglican,' and the sermon was the gospel for the\r\nday, amplified and rendered into the more modern and graceful English of\r\nthe preacher. And Mary came away.\r\n\r\nAfter their dinner (an excellent piece of Australian mutton, bought in\r\nthe 'World Wide' Stores, in Hammersmith), they sat for some time in the\r\ngarden, partly sheltered by the big mulberry tree from the observation\r\nof their neighbours. Edward smoked his honeydew, and Mary looked at him\r\nwith placid affection.\r\n\r\n'You never tell me about the men in your office,' she said at length.\r\n'Some of them are nice fellows, aren't they?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes, they're very decent. I must bring some of them round, one of\r\nthese days.'\r\n\r\nHe remembered with a pang that it would be necessary to provide whisky.\r\nOne couldn't ask the guest to drink table beer at tenpence the gallon.\r\n\r\n'Who are they, though?' said Mary. 'I think they might have given you a\r\nwedding present.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't know. We never have gone in for that sort of thing. But\r\nthey're very decent chaps. Well, there's Harvey; \"Sauce\" they call him\r\nbehind his back. He's mad on bicycling. He went in last year for the\r\nTwo Miles Amateur Record. He'd have made it, too, if he could have got\r\ninto better training.\r\n\r\n'Then there's James, a sporting man. You wouldn't care for him. I always\r\nthink he smells of the stable.'\r\n\r\n'How horrid!' said Mrs. Darnell, finding her husband a little frank,\r\nlowering her eyes as she spoke.\r\n\r\n'Dickenson might amuse you,' Darnell went on. 'He's always got a joke. A\r\nterrible liar, though. When he tells a tale we never know how much to\r\nbelieve. He swore the other day he'd seen one of the governors buying\r\ncockles off a barrow near London Bridge, and Jones, who's just come,\r\nbelieved every word of it.'\r\n\r\nDarnell laughed at the humorous recollection of the jest.\r\n\r\n'And that wasn't a bad yarn about Salter's wife,' he went on. 'Salter is\r\nthe manager, you know. Dickenson lives close by, in Notting Hill, and he\r\nsaid one morning that he had seen Mrs. Salter, in the Portobello Road,\r\nin red stockings, dancing to a piano organ.'\r\n\r\n'He's a little coarse, isn't he?' said Mrs. Darnell. 'I don't see much\r\nfun in that.'\r\n\r\n'Well, you know, amongst men it's different. You might like Wallis; he's\r\na tremendous photographer. He often shows us photos he's taken of his\r\nchildren--one, a little girl of three, in her bath. I asked him how he\r\nthought she'd like it when she was twenty-three.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Darnell looked down and made no answer.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for some minutes while Darnell smoked his pipe. 'I\r\nsay, Mary,' he said at length, 'what do you say to our taking a paying\r\nguest?'\r\n\r\n'A paying guest! I never thought of it. Where should we put him?'\r\n\r\n'Why, I was thinking of the spare room. The plan would obviate your\r\nobjection, wouldn't it? Lots of men in the City take them, and make\r\nmoney of it too. I dare say it would add ten pounds a year to our\r\nincome. Redgrave, the cashier, finds it worth his while to take a large\r\nhouse on purpose. They have a regular lawn for tennis and a\r\nbilliard-room.'\r\n\r\nMary considered gravely, always with the dream in her eyes. 'I don't\r\nthink we could manage it, Edward,' she said; 'it would be inconvenient\r\nin many ways.' She hesitated for a moment. 'And I don't think I should\r\ncare to have a young man in the house. It is so very small, and our\r\naccommodation, as you know, is so limited.'\r\n\r\nShe blushed slightly, and Edward, a little disappointed as he was,\r\nlooked at her with a singular longing, as if he were a scholar\r\nconfronted with a doubtful hieroglyph, either wholly wonderful or\r\naltogether commonplace. Next door children were playing in the garden,\r\nplaying shrilly, laughing, crying, quarrelling, racing to and fro.\r\nSuddenly a clear, pleasant voice sounded from an upper window.\r\n\r\n'Enid! Charles! Come up to my room at once!'\r\n\r\nThere was an instant sudden hush. The children's voices died away.\r\n\r\n'Mrs. Parker is supposed to keep her children in great order,' said\r\nMary. 'Alice was telling me about it the other day. She had been talking\r\nto Mrs. Parker's servant. I listened to her without any remark, as I\r\ndon't think it right to encourage servants' gossip; they always\r\nexaggerate everything. And I dare say children often require to be\r\ncorrected.'\r\n\r\nThe children were struck silent as if some ghastly terror had seized\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDarnell fancied that he heard a queer sort of cry from the house, but\r\ncould not be quite sure. He turned to the other side, where an elderly,\r\nordinary man with a grey moustache was strolling up and down on the\r\nfurther side of his garden. He caught Darnell's eye, and Mrs. Darnell\r\nlooking towards him at the same moment, he very politely raised his\r\ntweed cap. Darnell was surprised to see his wife blushing fiercely.\r\n\r\n'Sayce and I often go into the City by the same 'bus,' he said, 'and as\r\nit happens we've sat next to each other two or three times lately. I\r\nbelieve he's a traveller for a leather firm in Bermondsey. He struck me\r\nas a pleasant man. Haven't they got rather a good-looking servant?'\r\n\r\n'Alice has spoken to me about her--and the Sayces,' said Mrs. Darnell.\r\n'I understand that they are not very well thought of in the\r\nneighbourhood. But I must go in and see whether the tea is ready. Alice\r\nwill be wanting to go out directly.'\r\n\r\nDarnell looked after his wife as she walked quickly away. He only dimly\r\nunderstood, but he could see the charm of her figure, the delight of the\r\nbrown curls clustering about her neck, and he again felt that sense of\r\nthe scholar confronted by the hieroglyphic. He could not have expressed\r\nhis emotion, but he wondered whether he would ever find the key, and\r\nsomething told him that before she could speak to him his own lips must\r\nbe unclosed. She had gone into the house by the back kitchen door,\r\nleaving it open, and he heard her speaking to the girl about the water\r\nbeing 'really boiling.' He was amazed, almost indignant with himself;\r\nbut the sound of the words came to his ears as strange, heart-piercing\r\nmusic, tones from another, wonderful sphere. And yet he was her husband,\r\nand they had been married nearly a year; and yet, whenever she spoke, he\r\nhad to listen to the sense of what she said, constraining himself, lest\r\nhe should believe she was a magic creature, knowing the secrets of\r\nimmeasurable delight.\r\n\r\nHe looked out through the leaves of the mulberry tree. Mr. Sayce had\r\ndisappeared from his view, but he saw the light-blue fume of the cigar\r\nthat he was smoking floating slowly across the shadowed air. He was\r\nwondering at his wife's manner when Sayce's name was mentioned, puzzling\r\nhis head as to what could be amiss in the household of a most\r\nrespectable personage, when his wife appeared at the dining-room window\r\nand called him in to tea. She smiled as he looked up, and he rose\r\nhastily and walked in, wondering whether he were not a little 'queer,'\r\nso strange were the dim emotions and the dimmer impulses that rose\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\nAlice was all shining purple and strong scent, as she brought in the\r\nteapot and the jug of hot water. It seemed that a visit to the kitchen\r\nhad inspired Mrs. Darnell in her turn with a novel plan for disposing of\r\nthe famous ten pounds. The range had always been a trouble to her, and\r\nwhen sometimes she went into the kitchen, and found, as she said, the\r\nfire 'roaring halfway up the chimney,' it was in vain that she reproved\r\nthe maid on the ground of extravagance and waste of coal. Alice was\r\nready to admit the absurdity of making up such an enormous fire merely\r\nto bake (they called it 'roast') a bit of beef or mutton, and to boil\r\nthe potatoes and the cabbage; but she was able to show Mrs. Darnell that\r\nthe fault lay in the defective contrivance of the range, in an oven\r\nwhich 'would not get hot.' Even with a chop or a steak it was almost as\r\nbad; the heat seemed to escape up the chimney or into the room, and Mary\r\nhad spoken several times to her husband on the shocking waste of coal,\r\nand the cheapest coal procurable was never less than eighteen shillings\r\nthe ton. Mr. Darnell had written to the landlord, a builder, who had\r\nreplied in an illiterate but offensive communication, maintaining the\r\nexcellence of the stove and charging all the faults to the account of\r\n'your good lady,' which really implied that the Darnells kept no\r\nservant, and that Mrs. Darnell did everything. The range, then,\r\nremained, a standing annoyance and expense. Every morning, Alice said,\r\nshe had the greatest difficulty in getting the fire to light at all, and\r\nonce lighted it 'seemed as if it fled right up the chimney.' Only a few\r\nnights before Mrs. Darnell had spoken seriously to her husband about it;\r\nshe had got Alice to weigh the coals expended in cooking a cottage pie,\r\nthe dish of the evening, and deducting what remained in the scuttle\r\nafter the pie was done, it appeared that the wretched thing had consumed\r\nnearly twice the proper quantity of fuel.\r\n\r\n'You remember what I said the other night about the range?' said Mrs.\r\nDarnell, as she poured out the tea and watered the leaves. She thought\r\nthe introduction a good one, for though her husband was a most amiable\r\nman, she guessed that he had been just a little hurt by her decision\r\nagainst his furnishing scheme.\r\n\r\n'The range?' said Darnell. He paused as he helped himself to the\r\nmarmalade and considered for a moment. 'No, I don't recollect. What\r\nnight was it?'\r\n\r\n'Tuesday. Don't you remember? You had \"overtime,\" and didn't get home\r\ntill quite late.'\r\n\r\nShe paused for a moment, blushing slightly; and then began to\r\nrecapitulate the misdeeds of the range, and the outrageous outlay of\r\ncoal in the preparation of the cottage pie.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I recollect now. That was the night I thought I heard the\r\nnightingale (people say there are nightingales in Bedford Park), and the\r\nsky was such a wonderful deep blue.'\r\n\r\nHe remembered how he had walked from Uxbridge Road Station, where the\r\ngreen 'bus stopped, and in spite of the fuming kilns under Acton, a\r\ndelicate odour of the woods and summer fields was mysteriously in the\r\nair, and he had fancied that he smelt the red wild roses, drooping from\r\nthe hedge. As he came to his gate he saw his wife standing in the\r\ndoorway, with a light in her hand, and he threw his arms violently about\r\nher as she welcomed him, and whispered something in her ear, kissing her\r\nscented hair. He had felt quite abashed a moment afterwards, and he was\r\nafraid that he had frightened her by his nonsense; she seemed trembling\r\nand confused. And then she had told him how they had weighed the coal.\r\n\r\n'Yes, I remember now,' he said. 'It is a great nuisance, isn't it? I\r\nhate to throw away money like that.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what do you think? Suppose we bought a really good range with\r\naunt's money? It would save us a lot, and I expect the things would\r\ntaste much nicer.'\r\n\r\nDarnell passed the marmalade, and confessed that the idea was brilliant.\r\n\r\n'It's much better than mine, Mary,' he said quite frankly. 'I am so glad\r\nyou thought of it. But we must talk it over; it doesn't do to buy in a\r\nhurry. There are so many makes.'\r\n\r\nEach had seen ranges which looked miraculous inventions; he in the\r\nneighbourhood of the City; she in Oxford Street and Regent Street, on\r\nvisits to the dentist. They discussed the matter at tea, and afterwards\r\nthey discussed it walking round and round the garden, in the sweet cool\r\nof the evening.\r\n\r\n'They say the \"Newcastle\" will burn anything, coke even,' said Mary.\r\n\r\n'But the \"Glow\" got the gold medal at the Paris Exhibition,' said\r\nEdward.\r\n\r\n'But what about the \"Eutopia\" Kitchener? Have you seen it at work in\r\nOxford Street?' said Mary. 'They say their plan of ventilating the oven\r\nis quite unique.'\r\n\r\n'I was in Fleet Street the other day,' answered Edward, 'and I was\r\nlooking at the \"Bliss\" Patent Stoves. They burn less fuel than any in\r\nthe market--so the makers declare.'\r\n\r\nHe put his arm gently round her waist. She did not repel him; she\r\nwhispered quite softly--\r\n\r\n'I think Mrs. Parker is at her window,' and he drew his arm back slowly.\r\n\r\n'But we will talk it over,' he said. 'There is no hurry. I might call at\r\nsome of the places near the City, and you might do the same thing in\r\nOxford Street and Regent Street and Piccadilly, and we could compare\r\nnotes.'\r\n\r\nMary was quite pleased with her husband's good temper. It was so nice of\r\nhim not to find fault with her plan; 'He's so good to me,' she thought,\r\nand that was what she often said to her brother, who did not care much\r\nfor Darnell. They sat down on the seat under the mulberry, close\r\ntogether, and she let Darnell take her hand, and as she felt his shy,\r\nhesitating fingers touch her in the shadow, she pressed them ever so\r\nsoftly, and as he fondled her hand, his breath was on her neck, and she\r\nheard his passionate, hesitating voice whisper, 'My dear, my dear,' as\r\nhis lips touched her cheek. She trembled a little, and waited. Darnell\r\nkissed her gently on the cheek and drew away his hand, and when he spoke\r\nhe was almost breathless.\r\n\r\n'We had better go in now,' he said. 'There is a heavy dew, and you might\r\ncatch cold.'\r\n\r\nA warm, scented gale came to them from beyond the walls. He longed to\r\nask her to stay out with him all night beneath the tree, that they might\r\nwhisper to one another, that the scent of her hair might inebriate him,\r\nthat he might feel her dress still brushing against his ankles. But he\r\ncould not find the words, and it was absurd, and she was so gentle that\r\nshe would do whatever he asked, however foolish it might be, just\r\nbecause he asked her. He was not worthy to kiss her lips; he bent down\r\nand kissed her silk bodice, and again he felt that she trembled, and he\r\nwas ashamed, fearing that he had frightened her.\r\n\r\nThey went slowly into the house, side by side, and Darnell lit the gas\r\nin the drawing-room, where they always sat on Sunday evenings. Mrs.\r\nDarnell felt a little tired and lay down on the sofa, and Darnell took\r\nthe arm-chair opposite. For a while they were silent, and then Darnell\r\nsaid suddenly--\r\n\r\n'What's wrong with the Sayces? You seemed to think there was something a\r\nlittle strange about them. Their maid looks quite quiet.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I don't know that one ought to pay any attention to servants'\r\ngossip. They're not always very truthful.'\r\n\r\n'It was Alice told you, wasn't it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. She was speaking to me the other day, when I was in the kitchen in\r\nthe afternoon.'\r\n\r\n'But what was it?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I'd rather not tell you, Edward. It's not pleasant. I scolded Alice\r\nfor repeating it to me.'\r\n\r\nDarnell got up and took a small, frail chair near the sofa.\r\n\r\n'Tell me,' he said again, with an odd perversity. He did not really care\r\nto hear about the household next door, but he remembered how his wife's\r\ncheeks flushed in the afternoon, and now he was looking at her eyes.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I really couldn't tell you, dear. I should feel ashamed.'\r\n\r\n'But you're my wife.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, but it doesn't make any difference. A woman doesn't like to talk\r\nabout such things.'\r\n\r\nDarnell bent his head down. His heart was beating; he put his ear to her\r\nmouth and said, 'Whisper.'\r\n\r\nMary drew his head down still lower with her gentle hand, and her cheeks\r\nburned as she whispered--\r\n\r\n'Alice says that--upstairs--they have only--one room furnished. The maid\r\ntold her--herself.'\r\n\r\nWith an unconscious gesture she pressed his head to her breast, and he\r\nin turn was bending her red lips to his own, when a violent jangle\r\nclamoured through the silent house. They sat up, and Mrs. Darnell went\r\nhurriedly to the door.\r\n\r\n'That's Alice,' she said. 'She is always in in time. It has only just\r\nstruck ten.'\r\n\r\nDarnell shivered with annoyance. His lips, he knew, had almost been\r\nopened. Mary's pretty handkerchief, delicately scented from a little\r\nflagon that a school friend had given her, lay on the floor, and he\r\npicked it up, and kissed it, and hid it away.\r\n\r\nThe question of the range occupied them all through June and far into\r\nJuly. Mrs. Darnell took every opportunity of going to the West End and\r\ninvestigating the capacity of the latest makes, gravely viewing the new\r\nimprovements and hearing what the shopmen had to say; while Darnell, as\r\nhe said, 'kept his eyes open' about the City. They accumulated quite a\r\nliterature of the subject, bringing away illustrated pamphlets, and in\r\nthe evenings it was an amusement to look at the pictures. They viewed\r\nwith reverence and interest the drawings of great ranges for hotels and\r\npublic institutions, mighty contrivances furnished with a series of\r\novens each for a different use, with wonderful apparatus for grilling,\r\nwith batteries of accessories which seemed to invest the cook almost\r\nwith the dignity of a chief engineer. But when, in one of the lists,\r\nthey encountered the images of little toy 'cottage' ranges, for four\r\npounds, and even for three pounds ten, they grew scornful, on the\r\nstrength of the eight or ten pound article which they meant to\r\npurchase--when the merits of the divers patents had been thoroughly\r\nthrashed out.\r\n\r\nThe 'Raven' was for a long time Mary's favourite. It promised the utmost\r\neconomy with the highest efficiency, and many times they were on the\r\npoint of giving the order. But the 'Glow' seemed equally seductive, and\r\nit was only L8. 5s. as compared with L9. 7s. 6d., and though the 'Raven'\r\nwas supplied to the Royal Kitchen, the 'Glow' could show more fervent\r\ntestimonials from continental potentates.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a debate without end, and it endured day after day till that\r\nmorning, when Darnell woke from the dream of the ancient wood, of the\r\nfountains rising into grey vapour beneath the heat of the sun. As he\r\ndressed, an idea struck him, and he brought it as a shock to the hurried\r\nbreakfast, disturbed by the thought of the City 'bus which passed the\r\ncorner of the street at 9.15.\r\n\r\n'I've got an improvement on your plan, Mary,' he said, with triumph.\r\n'Look at that,' and he flung a little book on the table.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. 'It beats your notion all to fits. After all, the great\r\nexpense is the coal. It's not the stove--at least that's not the real\r\nmischief. It's the coal is so dear. And here you are. Look at those oil\r\nstoves. They don't burn any coal, but the cheapest fuel in the\r\nworld--oil; and for two pounds ten you can get a range that will do\r\neverything you want.'\r\n\r\n'Give me the book,' said Mary, 'and we will talk it over in the evening,\r\nwhen you come home. Must you be going?'\r\n\r\nDarnell cast an anxious glance at the clock.\r\n\r\n'Good-bye,' and they kissed each other seriously and dutifully, and\r\nMary's eyes made Darnell think of those lonely water-pools, hidden in\r\nthe shadow of the ancient woods.\r\n\r\nSo, day after day, he lived in the grey phantasmal world, akin to death,\r\nthat has, somehow, with most of us, made good its claim to be called\r\nlife. To Darnell the true life would have seemed madness, and when, now\r\nand again, the shadows and vague images reflected from its splendour\r\nfell across his path, he was afraid, and took refuge in what he would\r\nhave called the sane 'reality' of common and usual incidents and\r\ninterests. His absurdity was, perhaps, the more evident, inasmuch as\r\n'reality' for him was a matter of kitchen ranges, of saving a few\r\nshillings; but in truth the folly would have been greater if it had been\r\nconcerned with racing stables, steam yachts, and the spending of many\r\nthousand pounds.\r\n\r\nBut so went forth Darnell, day by day, strangely mistaking death for\r\nlife, madness for sanity, and purposeless and wandering phantoms for\r\ntrue beings. He was sincerely of opinion that he was a City clerk,\r\nliving in Shepherd's Bush--having forgotten the mysteries and the\r\nfar-shining glories of the kingdom which was his by legitimate\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nAll day long a fierce and heavy heat had brooded over the City, and as\r\nDarnell neared home he saw the mist lying on all the damp lowlands,\r\nwreathed in coils about Bedford Park to the south, and mounting to the\r\nwest, so that the tower of Acton Church loomed out of a grey lake. The\r\ngrass in the squares and on the lawns which he overlooked as the 'bus\r\nlumbered wearily along was burnt to the colour of dust. Shepherd's Bush\r\nGreen was a wretched desert, trampled brown, bordered with monotonous\r\npoplars, whose leaves hung motionless in air that was still, hot smoke.\r\nThe foot passengers struggled wearily along the pavements, and the reek\r\nof the summer's end mingled with the breath of the brickfields made\r\nDarnell gasp, as if he were inhaling the poison of some foul sick-room.\r\n\r\nHe made but a slight inroad into the cold mutton that adorned the\r\ntea-table, and confessed that he felt rather 'done up' by the weather\r\nand the day's work.\r\n\r\n'I have had a trying day, too,' said Mary. 'Alice has been very queer\r\nand troublesome all day, and I have had to speak to her quite seriously.\r\nYou know I think her Sunday evenings out have a rather unsettling\r\ninfluence on the girl. But what is one to do?'\r\n\r\n'Has she got a young man?'\r\n\r\n'Of course: a grocer's assistant from the Goldhawk Road--Wilkin's, you\r\nknow. I tried them when we settled here, but they were not very\r\nsatisfactory.'\r\n\r\n'What do they do with themselves all the evening? They have from five to\r\nten, haven't they?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; five, or sometimes half-past, when the water won't boil. Well, I\r\nbelieve they go for walks usually. Once or twice he has taken her to the\r\nCity Temple, and the Sunday before last they walked up and down Oxford\r\nStreet, and then sat in the Park. But it seems that last Sunday they\r\nwent to tea with his mother at Putney. I should like to tell the old\r\nwoman what I really think of her.'\r\n\r\n'Why? What happened? Was she nasty to the girl?'\r\n\r\n'No; that's just it. Before this, she has been very unpleasant on\r\nseveral occasions. When the young man first took Alice to see her--that\r\nwas in March--the girl came away crying; she told me so herself. Indeed,\r\nshe said she never wanted to see old Mrs. Murry again; and I told Alice\r\nthat, if she had not exaggerated things, I could hardly blame her for\r\nfeeling like that.'\r\n\r\n'Why? What did she cry for?'\r\n\r\n'Well, it seems that the old lady--she lives in quite a small cottage in\r\nsome Putney back street--was so stately that she would hardly speak. She\r\nhad borrowed a little girl from some neighbour's family, and had managed\r\nto dress her up to imitate a servant, and Alice said nothing could be\r\nsillier than to see that mite opening the door, with her black dress and\r\nher white cap and apron, and she hardly able to turn the handle, as\r\nAlice said. George (that's the young man's name) had told Alice that it\r\nwas a little bit of a house; but he said the kitchen was comfortable,\r\nthough very plain and old-fashioned. But, instead of going straight to\r\nthe back, and sitting by a big fire on the old settle that they had\r\nbrought up from the country, that child asked for their names (did you\r\never hear such nonsense?) and showed them into a little poky parlour,\r\nwhere old Mrs. Murry was sitting \"like a duchess,\" by a fireplace full\r\nof coloured paper, and the room as cold as ice. And she was so grand\r\nthat she would hardly speak to Alice.'\r\n\r\n'That must have been very unpleasant.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, the poor girl had a dreadful time. She began with: \"Very pleased to\r\nmake your acquaintance, Miss Dill. I know so very few persons in\r\nservice.\" Alice imitates her mincing way of talking, but I can't do it.\r\nAnd then she went on to talk about her family, how they had farmed their\r\nown land for five hundred years--such stuff! George had told Alice all\r\nabout it: they had had an old cottage with a good strip of garden and\r\ntwo fields somewhere in Essex, and that old woman talked almost as if\r\nthey had been country gentry, and boasted about the Rector, Dr.\r\nSomebody, coming to see them so often, and of Squire Somebody Else\r\nalways looking them up, as if they didn't visit them out of kindness.\r\nAlice told me it was as much as she could do to keep from laughing in\r\nMrs. Murry's face, her young man having told her all about the place,\r\nand how small it was, and how the Squire had been so kind about buying\r\nit when old Murry died and George was a little boy, and his mother not\r\nable to keep things going. However, that silly old woman \"laid it on\r\nthick,\" as you say, and the young man got more and more uncomfortable,\r\nespecially when she went on to speak about marrying in one's own class,\r\nand how unhappy she had known young men to be who had married beneath\r\nthem, giving some very pointed looks at Alice as she talked. And then\r\nsuch an amusing thing happened: Alice had noticed George looking about\r\nhim in a puzzled sort of way, as if he couldn't make out something or\r\nother, and at last he burst out and asked his mother if she had been\r\nbuying up the neighbours' ornaments, as he remembered the two green\r\ncut-glass vases on the mantelpiece at Mrs. Ellis's, and the wax flowers\r\nat Miss Turvey's. He was going on, but his mother scowled at him, and\r\nupset some books, which he had to pick up; but Alice quite understood\r\nshe had been borrowing things from her neighbours, just as she had\r\nborrowed the little girl, so as to look grander. And then they had\r\ntea--water bewitched, Alice calls it--and very thin bread and butter,\r\nand rubbishy foreign pastry from the Swiss shop in the High Street--all\r\nsour froth and rancid fat, Alice declares. And then Mrs. Murry began\r\nboasting again about her family, and snubbing Alice and talking at her,\r\ntill the girl came away quite furious, and very unhappy, too. I don't\r\nwonder at it, do you?'\r\n\r\n'It doesn't sound very enjoyable, certainly,' said Darnell, looking\r\ndreamily at his wife. He had not been attending very carefully to the\r\nsubject-matter of her story, but he loved to hear a voice that was\r\nincantation in his ears, tones that summoned before him the vision of a\r\nmagic world.\r\n\r\n'And has the young man's mother always been like this?' he said after a\r\nlong pause, desiring that the music should continue.\r\n\r\n'Always, till quite lately, till last Sunday in fact. Of course Alice\r\nspoke to George Murry at once, and said, like a sensible girl, that she\r\ndidn't think it ever answered for a married couple to live with the\r\nman's mother, \"especially,\" she went on, \"as I can see your mother\r\nhasn't taken much of a fancy to me.\" He told her, in the usual style, it\r\nwas only his mother's way, that she didn't really mean anything, and so\r\non; but Alice kept away for a long time, and rather hinted, I think,\r\nthat it might come to having to choose between her and his mother. And\r\nso affairs went on all through the spring and summer, and then, just\r\nbefore the August Bank Holiday, George spoke to Alice again about it,\r\nand told her how sorry the thought of any unpleasantness made him, and\r\nhow he wanted his mother and her to get on with each other, and how she\r\nwas only a bit old-fashioned and queer in her ways, and had spoken very\r\nnicely to him about her when there was nobody by. So the long and the\r\nshort of it was that Alice said she might come with them on the Monday,\r\nwhen they had settled to go to Hampton Court--the girl was always\r\ntalking about Hampton Court, and wanting to see it. You remember what a\r\nbeautiful day it was, don't you?'\r\n\r\n'Let me see,' said Darnell dreamily. 'Oh yes, of course--I sat out under\r\nthe mulberry tree all day, and we had our meals there: it was quite a\r\npicnic. The caterpillars were a nuisance, but I enjoyed the day very\r\nmuch.' His ears were charmed, ravished with the grave, supernal melody,\r\nas of antique song, rather of the first made world in which all speech\r\nwas descant, and all words were sacraments of might, speaking not to the\r\nmind but to the soul. He lay back in his chair, and said--\r\n\r\n'Well, what happened to them?'\r\n\r\n'My dear, would you believe it; but that wretched old woman behaved\r\nworse than ever. They met as had been arranged, at Kew Bridge, and got\r\nplaces, with a good deal of difficulty, in one of those char-a-banc\r\nthings, and Alice thought she was going to enjoy herself tremendously.\r\nNothing of the kind. They had hardly said \"Good morning,\" when old Mrs.\r\nMurry began to talk about Kew Gardens, and how beautiful it must be\r\nthere, and how much more convenient it was than Hampton, and no expense\r\nat all; just the trouble of walking over the bridge. Then she went on\r\nto say, as they were waiting for the char-a-banc, that she had always\r\nheard there was nothing to see at Hampton, except a lot of nasty, grimy\r\nold pictures, and some of them not fit for any decent woman, let alone\r\ngirl, to look at, and she wondered why the Queen allowed such things to\r\nbe shown, putting all kinds of notions into girls' heads that were light\r\nenough already; and as she said that she looked at Alice so\r\nnastily--horrid old thing--that, as she told me afterwards, Alice would\r\nhave slapped her face if she hadn't been an elderly woman, and George's\r\nmother. Then she talked about Kew again, saying how wonderful the\r\nhot-houses were, with palms and all sorts of wonderful things, and a\r\nlily as big as a parlour table, and the view over the river. George was\r\nvery good, Alice told me. He was quite taken aback at first, as the old\r\nwoman had promised faithfully to be as nice as ever she could be; but\r\nthen he said, gently but firmly, \"Well, mother, we must go to Kew some\r\nother day, as Alice has set her heart on Hampton for to-day, and I want\r\nto see it myself!\" All Mrs. Murry did was to snort, and look at the girl\r\nlike vinegar, and just then the char-a-banc came up, and they had to\r\nscramble for their seats. Mrs. Murry grumbled to herself in an\r\nindistinct sort of voice all the way to Hampton Court. Alice couldn't\r\nvery well make out what she said, but now and then she seemed to hear\r\nbits of sentences, like: _Pity to grow old, if sons grow bold_; and\r\n_Honour thy father and mother_; and _Lie on the shelf, said the\r\nhousewife to the old shoe, and the wicked son to his mother_; and _I\r\ngave you milk and you give me the go-by_. Alice thought they must be\r\nproverbs (except the Commandment, of course), as George was always\r\nsaying how old-fashioned his mother is; but she says there were so many\r\nof them, and all pointed at her and George, that she thinks now Mrs.\r\nMurry must have made them up as they drove along. She says it would be\r\njust like her to do it, being old-fashioned, and ill-natured too, and\r\nfuller of talk than a butcher on Saturday night. Well, they got to\r\nHampton at last, and Alice thought the place would please her, perhaps,\r\nand they might have some enjoyment. But she did nothing but grumble, and\r\nout loud too, so that people looked at them, and a woman said, so that\r\nthey could hear, \"Ah well, they'll be old themselves some day,\" which\r\nmade Alice very angry, for, as she said, they weren't doing anything.\r\nWhen they showed her the chestnut avenue in Bushey Park, she said it was\r\nso long and straight that it made her quite dull to look at it, and she\r\nthought the deer (you know how pretty they are, really) looked thin and\r\nmiserable, as if they would be all the better for a good feed of\r\nhog-wash, with plenty of meal in it. She said she knew they weren't\r\nhappy by the look in their eyes, which seemed to tell her that their\r\nkeepers beat them. It was the same with everything; she said she\r\nremembered market-gardens in Hammersmith and Gunnersbury that had a\r\nbetter show of flowers, and when they took her to the place where the\r\nwater is, under the trees, she burst out with its being rather hard to\r\ntramp her off her legs to show her a common canal, with not so much as a\r\nbarge on it to liven it up a bit. She went on like that the whole day,\r\nand Alice told me she was only too thankful to get home and get rid of\r\nher. Wasn't it wretched for the girl?'\r\n\r\n'It must have been, indeed. But what happened last Sunday?'\r\n\r\n'That's the most extraordinary thing of all. I noticed that Alice was\r\nrather queer in her manner this morning; she was a longer time washing\r\nup the breakfast things, and she answered me quite sharply when I called\r\nto her to ask when she would be ready to help me with the wash; and when\r\nI went into the kitchen to see about something, I noticed that she was\r\ngoing about her work in a sulky sort of way. So I asked her what was the\r\nmatter, and then it all came out. I could scarcely believe my own ears\r\nwhen she mumbled out something about Mrs. Murry thinking she could do\r\nvery much better for herself; but I asked her one question after another\r\ntill I had it all out of her. It just shows one how foolish and\r\nempty-headed these girls are. I told her she was no better than a\r\nweather-cock. If you will believe me, that horrid old woman was quite\r\nanother person when Alice went to see her the other night. Why, I can't\r\nthink, but so she was. She told the girl how pretty she was; what a neat\r\nfigure she had; how well she walked; and how she'd known many a girl not\r\nhalf so clever or well-looking earning her twenty-five or thirty pounds\r\na year, and with good families. She seems to have gone into all sorts of\r\ndetails, and made elaborate calculations as to what she would be able to\r\nsave, \"with decent folks, who don't screw, and pinch, and lock up\r\neverything in the house,\" and then she went off into a lot of\r\nhypocritical nonsense about how fond she was of Alice, and how she\r\ncould go to her grave in peace, knowing how happy her dear George would\r\nbe with such a good wife, and about her savings from good wages helping\r\nto set up a little home, ending up with \"And, if you take an old woman's\r\nadvice, deary, it won't be long before you hear the marriage bells.\"'\r\n\r\n'I see,' said Darnell; 'and the upshot of it all is, I suppose, that the\r\ngirl is thoroughly dissatisfied?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, she is so young and silly. I talked to her, and reminded her of\r\nhow nasty old Mrs. Murry had been, and told her that she might change\r\nher place and change for the worse. I think I have persuaded her to\r\nthink it over quietly, at all events. Do you know what it is, Edward? I\r\nhave an idea. I believe that wicked old woman is trying to get Alice to\r\nleave us, that she may tell her son how changeable she is; and I suppose\r\nshe would make up some of her stupid old proverbs: \"A changeable wife, a\r\ntroublesome life,\" or some nonsense of the kind. Horrid old thing!'\r\n\r\n'Well, well,' said Darnell, 'I hope she won't go, for your sake. It\r\nwould be such a bother for you, hunting for a fresh servant.'\r\n\r\nHe refilled his pipe and smoked placidly, refreshed somewhat after the\r\nemptiness and the burden of the day. The French window was wide open,\r\nand now at last there came a breath of quickening air, distilled by the\r\nnight from such trees as still wore green in that arid valley. The song\r\nto which Darnell had listened in rapture, and now the breeze, which even\r\nin that dry, grim suburb still bore the word of the woodland, had\r\nsummoned the dream to his eyes, and he meditated over matters that his\r\nlips could not express.\r\n\r\n'She must, indeed, be a villainous old woman,' he said at length.\r\n\r\n'Old Mrs. Murry? Of course she is; the mischievous old thing! Trying to\r\ntake the girl from a comfortable place where she is happy.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; and not to like Hampton Court! That shows how bad she must be,\r\nmore than anything.'\r\n\r\n'It is beautiful, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n'I shall never forget the first time I saw it. It was soon after I went\r\ninto the City; the first year. I had my holidays in July, and I was\r\ngetting such a small salary that I couldn't think of going away to the\r\nseaside, or anything like that. I remember one of the other men wanted\r\nme to come with him on a walking tour in Kent. I should have liked that,\r\nbut the money wouldn't run to it. And do you know what I did? I lived in\r\nGreat College Street then, and the first day I was off, I stayed in bed\r\ntill past dinner-time, and lounged about in an arm-chair with a pipe all\r\nthe afternoon. I had got a new kind of tobacco--one and four for the\r\ntwo-ounce packet--much dearer than I could afford to smoke, and I was\r\nenjoying it immensely. It was awfully hot, and when I shut the window\r\nand drew down the red blind it grew hotter; at five o'clock the room was\r\nlike an oven. But I was so pleased at not having to go into the City,\r\nthat I didn't mind anything, and now and again I read bits from a queer\r\nold book that had belonged to my poor dad. I couldn't make out what a\r\nlot of it meant, but it fitted in somehow, and I read and smoked till\r\ntea-time. Then I went out for a walk, thinking I should be better for a\r\nlittle fresh air before I went to bed; and I went wandering away, not\r\nmuch noticing where I was going, turning here and there as the fancy\r\ntook me. I must have gone miles and miles, and a good many of them round\r\nand round, as they say they do in Australia if they lose their way in\r\nthe bush; and I am sure I couldn't have gone exactly the same way all\r\nover again for any money. Anyhow, I was still in the streets when the\r\ntwilight came on, and the lamp-lighters were trotting round from one\r\nlamp to another. It was a wonderful night: I wish you had been there, my\r\ndear.'\r\n\r\n'I was quite a little girl then.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I suppose you were. Well, it was a wonderful night. I remember, I\r\nwas walking in a little street of little grey houses all alike, with\r\nstucco copings and stucco door-posts; there were brass plates on a lot\r\nof the doors, and one had \"Maker of Shell Boxes\" on it, and I was quite\r\npleased, as I had often wondered where those boxes and things that you\r\nbuy at the seaside came from. A few children were playing about in the\r\nroad with some rubbish or other, and men were singing in a small\r\npublic-house at the corner, and I happened to look up, and I noticed\r\nwhat a wonderful colour the sky had turned. I have seen it since, but I\r\ndon't think it has ever been quite what it was that night, a dark blue,\r\nglowing like a violet, just as they say the sky looks in foreign\r\ncountries. I don't know why, but the sky or something made me feel quite\r\nqueer; everything seemed changed in a way I couldn't understand. I\r\nremember, I told an old gentleman I knew then--a friend of my poor\r\nfather's, he's been dead for five years, if not more--about how I felt,\r\nand he looked at me and said something about fairyland; I don't know\r\nwhat he meant, and I dare say I didn't explain myself properly. But, do\r\nyou know, for a moment or two I felt as if that little back street was\r\nbeautiful, and the noise of the children and the men in the public-house\r\nseemed to fit in with the sky and become part of it. You know that old\r\nsaying about \"treading on air\" when one is glad! Well, I really felt\r\nlike that as I walked, not exactly like air, you know, but as if the\r\npavement was velvet or some very soft carpet. And then--I suppose it was\r\nall my fancy--the air seemed to smell sweet, like the incense in\r\nCatholic churches, and my breath came queer and catchy, as it does when\r\none gets very excited about anything. I felt altogether stranger than\r\nI've ever felt before or since.'\r\n\r\nDarnell stopped suddenly and looked up at his wife. She was watching him\r\nwith parted lips, with eager, wondering eyes.\r\n\r\n'I hope I'm not tiring you, dear, with all this story about nothing. You\r\nhave had a worrying day with that stupid girl; hadn't you better go to\r\nbed?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, please, Edward. I'm not a bit tired now. I love to hear you\r\ntalk like that. Please go on.'\r\n\r\n'Well, after I had walked a bit further, that queer sort of feeling\r\nseemed to fade away. I said a bit further, and I really thought I had\r\nbeen walking about five minutes, but I had looked at my watch just\r\nbefore I got into that little street, and when I looked at it again it\r\nwas eleven o'clock. I must have done about eight miles. I could scarcely\r\nbelieve my own eyes, and I thought my watch must have gone mad; but I\r\nfound out afterwards it was perfectly right. I couldn't make it out, and\r\nI can't now; I assure you the time passed as if I walked up one side of\r\nEdna Road and down the other. But there I was, right in the open\r\ncountry, with a cool wind blowing on me from a wood, and the air full of\r\nsoft rustling sounds, and notes of birds from the bushes, and the\r\nsinging noise of a little brook that ran under the road. I was standing\r\non the bridge when I took out my watch and struck a wax light to see the\r\ntime; and it came upon me suddenly what a strange evening it had been.\r\nIt was all so different, you see, to what I had been doing all my life,\r\nparticularly for the year before, and it almost seemed as if I couldn't\r\nbe the man who had been going into the City every day in the morning and\r\ncoming back from it every evening after writing a lot of uninteresting\r\nletters. It was like being pitched all of a sudden from one world into\r\nanother. Well, I found my way back somehow or other, and as I went along\r\nI made up my mind how I'd spend my holiday. I said to myself, \"I'll have\r\na walking tour as well as Ferrars, only mine is to be a tour of London\r\nand its environs,\" and I had got it all settled when I let myself into\r\nthe house about four o'clock in the morning, and the sun was shining,\r\nand the street almost as still as the wood at midnight!'\r\n\r\n'I think that was a capital idea of yours. Did you have your tour? Did\r\nyou buy a map of London?'\r\n\r\n'I had the tour all right. I didn't buy a map; that would have spoilt\r\nit, somehow; to see everything plotted out, and named, and measured.\r\nWhat I wanted was to feel that I was going where nobody had been before.\r\nThat's nonsense, isn't it? as if there could be any such places in\r\nLondon, or England either, for the matter of that.'\r\n\r\n'I know what you mean; you wanted to feel as if you were going on a sort\r\nof voyage of discovery. Isn't that it?'\r\n\r\n'Exactly, that's what I was trying to tell you. Besides, I didn't want\r\nto buy a map. I made a map.'\r\n\r\n'How do you mean? Did you make a map out of your head?'\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you about it afterwards. But do you really want to hear about\r\nmy grand tour?'\r\n\r\n'Of course I do; it must have been delightful. I call it a most original\r\nidea.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I was quite full of it, and what you said just now about a voyage\r\nof discovery reminds me of how I felt then. When I was a boy I was\r\nawfully fond of reading of great travellers--I suppose all boys are--and\r\nof sailors who were driven out of their course and found themselves in\r\nlatitudes where no ship had ever sailed before, and of people who\r\ndiscovered wonderful cities in strange countries; and all the second day\r\nof my holidays I was feeling just as I used to when I read these books.\r\nI didn't get up till pretty late. I was tired to death after all those\r\nmiles I had walked; but when I had finished my breakfast and filled my\r\npipe, I had a grand time of it. It was such nonsense, you know; as if\r\nthere could be anything strange or wonderful in London.'\r\n\r\n'Why shouldn't there be?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I don't know; but I have thought afterwards what a silly lad I\r\nmust have been. Anyhow, I had a great day of it, planning what I would\r\ndo, half making-believe--just like a kid--that I didn't know where I\r\nmight find myself, or what might happen to me. And I was enormously\r\npleased to think it was all my secret, that nobody else knew anything\r\nabout it, and that, whatever I might see, I would keep to myself. I had\r\nalways felt like that about the books. Of course, I loved reading them,\r\nbut it seemed to me that, if I had been a discoverer, I would have kept\r\nmy discoveries a secret. If I had been Columbus, and, if it could\r\npossibly have been managed, I would have found America all by myself,\r\nand never have said a word about it to anybody. Fancy! how beautiful it\r\nwould be to be walking about in one's own town, and talking to people,\r\nand all the while to have the thought that one knew of a great world\r\nbeyond the seas, that nobody else dreamed of. I should have loved that!\r\n\r\n'And that is exactly what I felt about the tour I was going to make. I\r\nmade up my mind that nobody should know; and so, from that day to this,\r\nnobody has heard a word of it.'\r\n\r\n'But you are going to tell me?'\r\n\r\n'You are different. But I don't think even you will hear everything; not\r\nbecause I won't, but because I can't tell many of the things I saw.'\r\n\r\n'Things you saw? Then you really did see wonderful, strange things in\r\nLondon?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I did and I didn't. Everything, or pretty nearly everything, that\r\nI saw is standing still, and hundreds of thousands of people have looked\r\nat the same sights--there were many places that the fellows in the\r\noffice knew quite well, I found out afterwards. And then I read a book\r\ncalled \"London and its Surroundings.\" But (I don't know how it is)\r\nneither the men at the office nor the writers of the book seem to have\r\nseen the things that I did. That's why I stopped reading the book; it\r\nseemed to take the life, the real heart, out of everything, making it as\r\ndry and stupid as the stuffed birds in a museum.\r\n\r\n'I thought about what I was going to do all that day, and went to bed\r\nearly, so as to be fresh. I knew wonderfully little about London,\r\nreally; though, except for an odd week now and then, I had spent all my\r\nlife in town. Of course I knew the main streets--the Strand, Regent\r\nStreet, Oxford Street, and so on--and I knew the way to the school I\r\nused to go to when I was a boy, and the way into the City. But I had\r\njust kept to a few tracks, as they say the sheep do on the mountains;\r\nand that made it all the easier for me to imagine that I was going to\r\ndiscover a new world.'\r\n\r\nDarnell paused in the stream of his talk. He looked keenly at his wife\r\nto see if he were wearying her, but her eyes gazed at him with unabated\r\ninterest--one would have almost said that they were the eyes of one who\r\nlonged and half expected to be initiated into the mysteries, who knew\r\nnot what great wonder was to be revealed. She sat with her back to the\r\nopen window, framed in the sweet dusk of the night, as if a painter had\r\nmade a curtain of heavy velvet behind her; and the work that she had\r\nbeen doing had fallen to the floor. She supported her head with her two\r\nhands placed on each side of her brow, and her eyes were as the wells in\r\nthe wood of which Darnell dreamed in the night-time and in the day.\r\n\r\n'And all the strange tales I had ever heard were in my head that\r\nmorning,' he went on, as if continuing the thoughts that had filled his\r\nmind while his lips were silent. 'I had gone to bed early, as I told\r\nyou, to get a thorough rest, and I had set my alarum clock to wake me\r\nat three, so that I might set out at an hour that was quite strange for\r\nthe beginning of a journey. There was a hush in the world when I awoke,\r\nbefore the clock had rung to arouse me, and then a bird began to sing\r\nand twitter in the elm tree that grew in the next garden, and I looked\r\nout of the window, and everything was still, and the morning air\r\nbreathed in pure and sweet, as I had never known it before. My room was\r\nat the back of the house, and most of the gardens had trees in them, and\r\nbeyond these trees I could see the backs of the houses of the next\r\nstreet rising like the wall of an old city; and as I looked the sun\r\nrose, and the great light came in at my window, and the day began.\r\n\r\n'And I found that when I was once out of the streets just about me that\r\nI knew, some of the queer feeling that had come to me two days before\r\ncame back again. It was not nearly so strong, the streets no longer\r\nsmelt of incense, but still there was enough of it to show me what a\r\nstrange world I passed by. There were things that one may see again and\r\nagain in many London streets: a vine or a fig tree on a wall, a lark\r\nsinging in a cage, a curious shrub blossoming in a garden, an odd shape\r\nof a roof, or a balcony with an uncommon-looking trellis-work in iron.\r\nThere's scarcely a street, perhaps, where you won't see one or other of\r\nsuch things as these; but that morning they rose to my eyes in a new\r\nlight, as if I had on the magic spectacles in the fairy tale, and just\r\nlike the man in the fairy tale, I went on and on in the new light. I\r\nremember going through wild land on a high place; there were pools of\r\nwater shining in the sun, and great white houses in the middle of dark,\r\nrocking pines, and then on the turn of the height I came to a little\r\nlane that went aside from the main road, a lane that led to a wood, and\r\nin the lane was a little old shadowed house, with a bell turret in the\r\nroof, and a porch of trellis-work all dim and faded into the colour of\r\nthe sea; and in the garden there were growing tall, white lilies, just\r\nas we saw them that day we went to look at the old pictures; they were\r\nshining like silver, and they filled the air with their sweet scent. It\r\nwas from near that house I saw the valley and high places far away in\r\nthe sun. So, as I say, I went \"on and on,\" by woods and fields, till I\r\ncame to a little town on the top of a hill, a town full of old houses\r\nbowing to the ground beneath their years, and the morning was so still\r\nthat the blue smoke rose up straight into the sky from all the\r\nroof-tops, so still that I heard far down in the valley the song of a\r\nboy who was singing an old song through the streets as he went to\r\nschool, and as I passed through the awakening town, beneath the old,\r\ngrave houses, the church bells began to ring.\r\n\r\n'It was soon after I had left this town behind me that I found the\r\nStrange Road. I saw it branching off from the dusty high road, and it\r\nlooked so green that I turned aside into it, and soon I felt as if I had\r\nreally come into a new country. I don't know whether it was one of the\r\nroads the old Romans made that my father used to tell me about; but it\r\nwas covered with deep, soft turf, and the great tall hedges on each side\r\nlooked as if they had not been touched for a hundred years; they had\r\ngrown so broad and high and wild that they met overhead, and I could\r\nonly get glimpses here and there of the country through which I was\r\npassing, as one passes in a dream. The Strange Road led me on and on,\r\nup and down hill; sometimes the rose bushes had grown so thick that I\r\ncould scarcely make my way between them, and sometimes the road\r\nbroadened out into a green, and in one valley a brook, spanned by an old\r\nwooden bridge, ran across it. I was tired, and I found a soft and shady\r\nplace beneath an ash tree, where I must have slept for many hours, for\r\nwhen I woke up it was late in the afternoon. So I went on again, and at\r\nlast the green road came out into the highway, and I looked up and saw\r\nanother town on a high place with a great church in the middle of it,\r\nand when I went up to it there was a great organ sounding from within,\r\nand the choir was singing.'\r\n\r\nThere was a rapture in Darnell's voice as he spoke, that made his story\r\nwell-nigh swell into a song, and he drew a long breath as the words\r\nended, filled with the thought of that far-off summer day, when some\r\nenchantment had informed all common things, transmuting them into a\r\ngreat sacrament, causing earthly works to glow with the fire and the\r\nglory of the everlasting light.\r\n\r\nAnd some splendour of that light shone on the face of Mary as she sat\r\nstill against the sweet gloom of the night, her dark hair making her\r\nface more radiant. She was silent for a little while, and then she\r\nspoke--\r\n\r\n'Oh, my dear, why have you waited so long to tell me these wonderful\r\nthings? I think it is beautiful. Please go on.'\r\n\r\n'I have always been afraid it was all nonsense,' said Darnell. 'And I\r\ndon't know how to explain what I feel. I didn't think I could say so\r\nmuch as I have to-night.'\r\n\r\n'And did you find it the same day after day?'\r\n\r\n'All through the tour? Yes, I think every journey was a success. Of\r\ncourse, I didn't go so far afield every day; I was too tired. Often I\r\nrested all day long, and went out in the evening, after the lamps were\r\nlit, and then only for a mile or two. I would roam about old, dim\r\nsquares, and hear the wind from the hills whispering in the trees; and\r\nwhen I knew I was within call of some great glittering street, I was\r\nsunk in the silence of ways where I was almost the only passenger, and\r\nthe lamps were so few and faint that they seemed to give out shadows\r\ninstead of light. And I would walk slowly, to and fro, perhaps for an\r\nhour at a time, in such dark streets, and all the time I felt what I\r\ntold you about its being my secret--that the shadow, and the dim lights,\r\nand the cool of the evening, and trees that were like dark low clouds\r\nwere all mine, and mine alone, that I was living in a world that nobody\r\nelse knew of, into which no one could enter.\r\n\r\n'I remembered one night I had gone farther. It was somewhere in the far\r\nwest, where there are orchards and gardens, and great broad lawns that\r\nslope down to trees by the river. A great red moon rose that night\r\nthrough mists of sunset, and thin, filmy clouds, and I wandered by a\r\nroad that passed through the orchards, till I came to a little hill,\r\nwith the moon showing above it glowing like a great rose. Then I saw\r\nfigures pass between me and the moon, one by one, in a long line, each\r\nbent double, with great packs upon their shoulders. One of them was\r\nsinging, and then in the middle of the song I heard a horrible shrill\r\nlaugh, in the thin cracked voice of a very old woman, and they\r\ndisappeared into the shadow of the trees. I suppose they were people\r\ngoing to work, or coming from work in the gardens; but how like it was\r\nto a nightmare!\r\n\r\n'I can't tell you about Hampton; I should never finish talking. I was\r\nthere one evening, not long before they closed the gates, and there were\r\nvery few people about. But the grey-red, silent, echoing courts, and the\r\nflowers falling into dreamland as the night came on, and the dark yews\r\nand shadowy-looking statues, and the far, still stretches of water\r\nbeneath the avenues; and all melting into a blue mist, all being hidden\r\nfrom one's eyes, slowly, surely, as if veils were dropped, one by one,\r\non a great ceremony! Oh! my dear, what could it mean? Far away, across\r\nthe river, I heard a soft bell ring three times, and three times, and\r\nagain three times, and I turned away, and my eyes were full of tears.\r\n\r\n'I didn't know what it was when I came to it; I only found out\r\nafterwards that it must have been Hampton Court. One of the men in the\r\noffice told me he had taken an A. B. C. girl there, and they had great\r\nfun. They got into the maze and couldn't get out again, and then they\r\nwent on the river and were nearly drowned. He told me there were some\r\nspicy pictures in the galleries; his girl shrieked with laughter, so he\r\nsaid.'\r\n\r\nMary quite disregarded this interlude.\r\n\r\n'But you told me you had made a map. What was it like?'\r\n\r\n'I'll show it you some day, if you want to see it. I marked down all the\r\nplaces I had gone to, and made signs--things like queer letters--to\r\nremind me of what I had seen. Nobody but myself could understand it. I\r\nwanted to draw pictures, but I never learnt how to draw, so when I tried\r\nnothing was like what I wanted it to be. I tried to draw a picture of\r\nthat town on the hill that I came to on the evening of the first day; I\r\nwanted to make a steep hill with houses on top, and in the middle, but\r\nhigh above them, the great church, all spires and pinnacles, and above\r\nit, in the air, a cup with rays coming from it. But it wasn't a success.\r\nI made a very strange sign for Hampton Court, and gave it a name that I\r\nmade up out of my head.'\r\n\r\nThe Darnells avoided one another's eyes as they sat at breakfast the\r\nnext morning. The air had lightened in the night, for rain had fallen at\r\ndawn; and there was a bright blue sky, with vast white clouds rolling\r\nacross it from the south-west, and a fresh and joyous wind blew in at\r\nthe open window; the mists had vanished. And with the mists there seemed\r\nto have vanished also the sense of strange things that had possessed\r\nMary and her husband the night before; and as they looked out into the\r\nclear light they could scarcely believe that the one had spoken and the\r\nother had listened a few hours before to histories very far removed from\r\nthe usual current of their thoughts and of their lives. They glanced\r\nshyly at one another, and spoke of common things, of the question\r\nwhether Alice would be corrupted by the insidious Mrs. Murry, or whether\r\nMrs. Darnell would be able to persuade the girl that the old woman must\r\nbe actuated by the worst motives.\r\n\r\n'And I think, if I were you,' said Darnell, as he went out, 'I should\r\nstep over to the stores and complain of their meat. That last piece of\r\nbeef was very far from being up to the mark--full of sinew.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nIt might have been different in the evening, and Darnell had matured a\r\nplan by which he hoped to gain much. He intended to ask his wife if she\r\nwould mind having only one gas, and that a good deal lowered, on the\r\npretext that his eyes were tired with work; he thought many things might\r\nhappen if the room were dimly lit, and the window opened, so that they\r\ncould sit and watch the night, and listen to the rustling murmur of the\r\ntree on the lawn. But his plans were made in vain, for when he got to\r\nthe garden gate his wife, in tears, came forth to meet him.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Edward,' she began, 'such a dreadful thing has happened! I never\r\nliked him much, but I didn't think he would ever do such awful things.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean? Who are you talking about? What has happened? Is it\r\nAlice's young man?'\r\n\r\n'No, no. But come in, dear. I can see that woman opposite watching us:\r\nshe's always on the look out.'\r\n\r\n'Now, what is it?' said Darnell, as they sat down to tea. 'Tell me,\r\nquick! you've quite frightened me.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know how to begin, or where to start. Aunt Marian has thought\r\nthat there was something queer for weeks. And then she found--oh, well,\r\nthe long and short of it is that Uncle Robert has been carrying on\r\ndreadfully with some horrid girl, and aunt has found out everything!'\r\n\r\n'Lord! you don't say so! The old rascal! Why, he must be nearer seventy\r\nthan sixty!'\r\n\r\n'He's just sixty-five; and the money he has given her----'\r\n\r\nThe first shock of surprise over, Darnell turned resolutely to his\r\nmince.\r\n\r\n'We'll have it all out after tea,' he said; 'I am not going to have my\r\nmeals spoilt by that old fool of a Nixon. Fill up my cup, will you,\r\ndear?'\r\n\r\n'Excellent mince this,' he went on, calmly. 'A little lemon juice and a\r\nbit of ham in it? I thought there was something extra. Alice all right\r\nto-day? That's good. I expect she's getting over all that nonsense.'\r\n\r\nHe went on calmly chattering in a manner that astonished Mrs. Darnell,\r\nwho felt that by the fall of Uncle Robert the natural order had been\r\ninverted, and had scarcely touched food since the intelligence had\r\narrived by the second post. She had started out to keep the appointment\r\nher aunt had made early in the morning, and had spent most of the day in\r\na first-class waiting-room at Victoria Station, where she had heard all\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said Darnell, when the table had been cleared, 'tell us all about\r\nit. How long has it been going on?'\r\n\r\n'Aunt thinks now, from little things she remembers, that it must have\r\nbeen going on for a year at least. She says there has been a horrid kind\r\nof mystery about uncle's behaviour for a long time, and her nerves were\r\nquite shaken, as she thought he must be involved with Anarchists, or\r\nsomething dreadful of the sort.'\r\n\r\n'What on earth made her think that?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you see, once or twice when she was out walking with her husband,\r\nshe has been startled by whistles, which seemed to follow them\r\neverywhere. You know there are some nice country walks at Barnet, and\r\none in particular, in the fields near Totteridge, that uncle and aunt\r\nrather made a point of going to on fine Sunday evenings. Of course, this\r\nwas not the first thing she noticed, but, at the time, it made a great\r\nimpression on her mind; she could hardly get a wink of sleep for weeks\r\nand weeks.'\r\n\r\n'Whistling?' said Darnell. 'I don't quite understand. Why should she be\r\nfrightened by whistling?'\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you. The first time it happened was one Sunday in last May.\r\nAunt had a fancy they were being followed a Sunday or two before, but\r\nshe didn't see or hear anything, except a sort of crackling noise in the\r\nhedge. But this particular Sunday they had hardly got through the stile\r\ninto the fields, when she heard a peculiar kind of low whistle. She took\r\nno notice, thinking it was no concern of hers or her husband's, but as\r\nthey went on she heard it again, and then again, and it followed them\r\nthe whole walk, and it made her so uncomfortable, because she didn't\r\nknow where it was coming from or who was doing it, or why. Then, just as\r\nthey got out of the fields into the lane, uncle said he felt quite\r\nfaint, and he thought he would try a little brandy at the \"Turpin's\r\nHead,\" a small public-house there is there. And she looked at him and\r\nsaw his face was quite purple--more like apoplexy, as she says, than\r\nfainting fits, which make people look a sort of greenish-white. But she\r\nsaid nothing, and thought perhaps uncle had a peculiar way of fainting\r\nof his own, as he always was a man to have his own way of doing\r\neverything. So she just waited in the road, and he went ahead and\r\nslipped into the public, and aunt says she thought she saw a little\r\nfigure rise out of the dusk and slip in after him, but she couldn't be\r\nsure. And when uncle came out he looked red instead of purple, and said\r\nhe felt much better; and so they went home quietly together, and nothing\r\nmore was said. You see, uncle had said nothing about the whistling, and\r\naunt had been so frightened that she didn't dare speak, for fear they\r\nmight be both shot.\r\n\r\n'She wasn't thinking anything more about it, when two Sundays afterwards\r\nthe very same thing happened just as it had before. This time aunt\r\nplucked up a spirit, and asked uncle what it could be. And what do you\r\nthink he said? \"Birds, my dear, birds.\" Of course aunt said to him that\r\nno bird that ever flew with wings made a noise like that: sly, and low,\r\nwith pauses in between; and then he said that many rare sorts of birds\r\nlived in North Middlesex and Hertfordshire. \"Nonsense, Robert,\" said\r\naunt, \"how can you talk so, considering it has followed us all the way,\r\nfor a mile or more?\" And then uncle told her that some birds were so\r\nattached to man that they would follow one about for miles sometimes; he\r\nsaid he had just been reading about a bird like that in a book of\r\ntravels. And do you know that when they got home he actually showed her\r\na piece in the \"Hertfordshire Naturalist\" which they took in to oblige a\r\nfriend of theirs, all about rare birds found in the neighbourhood, all\r\nthe most outlandish names, aunt says, that she had never heard or\r\nthought of, and uncle had the impudence to say that it must have been a\r\nPurple Sandpiper, which, the paper said, had \"a low shrill note,\r\nconstantly repeated.\" And then he took down a book of Siberian Travels\r\nfrom the bookcase and showed her a page which told how a man was\r\nfollowed by a bird all day long through a forest. And that's what Aunt\r\nMarian says vexes her more than anything almost; to think that he should\r\nbe so artful and ready with those books, twisting them to his own wicked\r\nends. But, at the time, when she was out walking, she simply couldn't\r\nmake out what he meant by talking about birds in that random, silly sort\r\nof way, so unlike him, and they went on, that horrible whistling\r\nfollowing them, she looking straight ahead and walking fast, really\r\nfeeling more huffy and put out than frightened. And when they got to the\r\nnext stile, she got over and turned round, and \"lo and behold,\" as she\r\nsays, there was no Uncle Robert to be seen! She felt herself go quite\r\nwhite with alarm, thinking of that whistle, and making sure he'd been\r\nspirited away or snatched in some way or another, and she had just\r\nscreamed out \"Robert\" like a mad woman, when he came quite slowly round\r\nthe corner, as cool as a cucumber, holding something in his hand. He\r\nsaid there were some flowers he could never pass, and when aunt saw that\r\nhe had got a dandelion torn up by the roots, she felt as if her head\r\nwere going round.'\r\n\r\nMary's story was suddenly interrupted. For ten minutes Darnell had been\r\nwrithing in his chair, suffering tortures in his anxiety to avoid\r\nwounding his wife's feelings, but the episode of the dandelion was too\r\nmuch for him, and he burst into a long, wild shriek of laughter,\r\naggravated by suppression into the semblance of a Red Indian's\r\nwar-whoop. Alice, who was washing-up in the scullery, dropped some three\r\nshillings' worth of china, and the neighbours ran out into their gardens\r\nwondering if it were murder. Mary gazed reproachfully at her husband.\r\n\r\n'How can you be so unfeeling, Edward?' she said, at length, when\r\nDarnell had passed into the feebleness of exhaustion. 'If you had seen\r\nthe tears rolling down poor Aunt Marian's cheeks as she told me, I don't\r\nthink you would have laughed. I didn't think you were so hard-hearted.'\r\n\r\n'My dear Mary,' said Darnell, faintly, through sobs and catching of the\r\nbreath, 'I am awfully sorry. I know it's very sad, really, and I'm not\r\nunfeeling; but it is such an odd tale, now, isn't it? The Sandpiper, you\r\nknow, and then the dandelion!'\r\n\r\nHis face twitched and he ground his teeth together. Mary looked gravely\r\nat him for a moment, and then she put her hands to her face, and Darnell\r\ncould see that she also shook with merriment.\r\n\r\n'I am as bad as you,' she said, at last. 'I never thought of it in that\r\nway. I'm glad I didn't, or I should have laughed in Aunt Marian's face,\r\nand I wouldn't have done that for the world. Poor old thing; she cried\r\nas if her heart would break. I met her at Victoria, as she asked me, and\r\nwe had some soup at a confectioner's. I could scarcely touch it; her\r\ntears kept dropping into the plate all the time; and then we went to the\r\nwaiting-room at the station, and she cried there terribly.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Darnell, 'what happened next? I won't laugh any more.'\r\n\r\n'No, we mustn't; it's much too horrible for a joke. Well, of course aunt\r\nwent home and wondered and wondered what could be the matter, and tried\r\nto think it out, but, as she says, she could make nothing of it. She\r\nbegan to be afraid that uncle's brain was giving way through overwork,\r\nas he had stopped in the City (as he said) up to all hours lately, and\r\nhe had to go to Yorkshire (wicked old story-teller!), about some very\r\ntiresome business connected with his leases. But then she reflected that\r\nhowever queer he might be getting, even his queerness couldn't make\r\nwhistles in the air, though, as she said, he was always a wonderful man.\r\nSo she had to give that up; and then she wondered if there were anything\r\nthe matter with her, as she had read about people who heard noises when\r\nthere was really nothing at all. But that wouldn't do either, because\r\nthough it might account for the whistling, it wouldn't account for the\r\ndandelion or the Sandpiper, or for fainting fits that turned purple, or\r\nany of uncle's queerness. So aunt said she could think of nothing but to\r\nread the Bible every day from the beginning, and by the time she got\r\ninto Chronicles she felt rather better, especially as nothing had\r\nhappened for three or four Sundays. She noticed uncle seemed\r\nabsent-minded, and not as nice to her as he might be, but she put that\r\ndown to too much work, as he never came home before the last train, and\r\nhad a hansom twice all the way, getting there between three and four in\r\nthe morning. Still, she felt it was no good bothering her head over what\r\ncouldn't be made out or explained anyway, and she was just settling\r\ndown, when one Sunday evening it began all over again, and worse things\r\nhappened. The whistling followed them just as it did before, and poor\r\naunt set her teeth and said nothing to uncle, as she knew he would only\r\ntell her stories, and they were walking on, not saying a word, when\r\nsomething made her look back, and there was a horrible boy with red\r\nhair, peeping through the hedge just behind, and grinning. She said it\r\nwas a dreadful face, with something unnatural about it, as if it had\r\nbeen a dwarf, and before she had time to have a good look, it popped\r\nback like lightning, and aunt all but fainted away.'\r\n\r\n'A red-headed _boy_?' said Darnell. 'I thought----What an extraordinary\r\nstory this is. I've never heard of anything so queer. Who was the boy?'\r\n\r\n'You will know in good time,' said Mrs. Darnell. 'It _is_ very strange,\r\nisn't it?'\r\n\r\n'Strange!' Darnell ruminated for a while.\r\n\r\n'I know what I think, Mary,' he said at length. 'I don't believe a word\r\nof it. I believe your aunt is going mad, or has gone mad, and that she\r\nhas delusions. The whole thing sounds to me like the invention of a\r\nlunatic.'\r\n\r\n'You are quite wrong. Every word is true, and if you will let me go on,\r\nyou will understand how it all happened.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, go ahead.'\r\n\r\n'Let me see, where was I? Oh, I know, aunt saw the boy grinning in the\r\nhedge. Yes, well, she was dreadfully frightened for a minute or two;\r\nthere was something so queer about the face, but then she plucked up a\r\nspirit and said to herself, \"After all, better a boy with red hair than\r\na big man with a gun,\" and she made up her mind to watch Uncle Robert\r\nclosely, as she could see by his look he knew all about it; he seemed as\r\nif he were thinking hard and puzzling over something, as if he didn't\r\nknow what to do next, and his mouth kept opening and shutting, like a\r\nfish's. So she kept her face straight, and didn't say a word, and when\r\nhe said something to her about the fine sunset, she took no notice.\r\n\"Don't you hear what I say, Marian?\" he said, speaking quite crossly,\r\nand bellowing as if it were to somebody in the next field. So aunt said\r\nshe was very sorry, but her cold made her so deaf, she couldn't hear\r\nmuch. She noticed uncle looked quite pleased, and relieved too, and she\r\nknew he thought she hadn't heard the whistling. Suddenly uncle pretended\r\nto see a beautiful spray of honeysuckle high up in the hedge, and he\r\nsaid he must get it for aunt, only she must go on ahead, as it made him\r\nnervous to be watched. She said she would, but she just stepped aside\r\nbehind a bush where there was a sort of cover in the hedge, and found\r\nshe could see him quite well, though she scratched her face terribly\r\nwith poking it into a rose bush. And in a minute or two out came the boy\r\nfrom behind the hedge, and she saw uncle and him talking, and she knew\r\nit was the same boy, as it wasn't dark enough to hide his flaming red\r\nhead. And uncle put out his hand as if to catch him, but he just darted\r\ninto the bushes and vanished. Aunt never said a word at the time, but\r\nthat night when they got home she charged uncle with what she'd seen and\r\nasked him what it all meant. He was quite taken aback at first, and\r\nstammered and stuttered and said a spy wasn't his notion of a good wife,\r\nbut at last he made her swear secrecy, and told her that he was a very\r\nhigh Freemason, and that the boy was an emissary of the order who\r\nbrought him messages of the greatest importance. But aunt didn't believe\r\na word of it, as an uncle of hers was a mason, and he never behaved like\r\nthat. It was then she began to be afraid that it was really Anarchists,\r\nor something of the kind, and every time the bell rang she thought that\r\nuncle had been found out, and the police had come for him.'\r\n\r\n'What nonsense! As if a man with house property would be an Anarchist.'\r\n\r\n'Well, she could see there must be some horrible secret, and she didn't\r\nknow what else to think. And then she began to have the things through\r\nthe post.'\r\n\r\n'Things through the post! What do you mean by that?'\r\n\r\n'All sorts of things; bits of broken bottle-glass, packed carefully as\r\nif it were jewellery; parcels that unrolled and unrolled worse than\r\nChinese boxes, and then had \"cat\" in large letters when you came to the\r\nmiddle; old artificial teeth, a cake of red paint, and at last\r\ncockroaches.'\r\n\r\n'Cockroaches by post! Stuff and nonsense; your aunt's mad.'\r\n\r\n'Edward, she showed me the box; it was made to hold cigarettes, and\r\nthere were three dead cockroaches inside. And when she found a box of\r\nexactly the same kind, half-full of cigarettes, in uncle's great-coat\r\npocket, then her head began to turn again.'\r\n\r\nDarnell groaned, and stirred uneasily in his chair, feeling that the\r\ntale of Aunt Marian's domestic troubles was putting on the semblance of\r\nan evil dream.\r\n\r\n'Anything else?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'My dear, I haven't repeated half the things poor aunt told me this\r\nafternoon. There was the night she thought she saw a ghost in the\r\nshrubbery. She was anxious about some chickens that were just due to\r\nhatch out, so she went out after dark with some egg and bread-crumbs, in\r\ncase they might be out. And just before her she saw a figure gliding by\r\nthe rhododendrons. It looked like a short, slim man dressed as they\r\nused to be hundreds of years ago; she saw the sword by his side, and\r\nthe feather in his cap. She thought she should have died, she said, and\r\nthough it was gone in a minute, and she tried to make out it was all her\r\nfancy, she fainted when she got into the house. Uncle was at home that\r\nnight, and when she came to and told him he ran out, and stayed out for\r\nhalf-an-hour or more, and then came in and said he could find nothing;\r\nand the next minute aunt heard that low whistle just outside the window,\r\nand uncle ran out again.'\r\n\r\n'My dear Mary, do let us come to the point. What on earth does it all\r\nlead to?'\r\n\r\n'Haven't you guessed? Why, of course it was that girl all the time.'\r\n\r\n'Girl? I thought you said it was a boy with a red head?'\r\n\r\n'Don't you see? She's an actress, and she dressed up. She won't leave\r\nuncle alone. It wasn't enough that he was with her nearly every evening\r\nin the week, but she must be after him on Sundays too. Aunt found a\r\nletter the horrid thing had written, and so it has all come out. Enid\r\nVivian she calls herself, though I don't suppose she has any right to\r\none name or the other. And the question is, what is to be done?'\r\n\r\n'Let us talk of that again. I'll have a pipe, and then we'll go to bed.'\r\n\r\nThey were almost asleep when Mary said suddenly--\r\n\r\n'Doesn't it seem queer, Edward? Last night you were telling me such\r\nbeautiful things, and to-night I have been talking about that\r\ndisgraceful old man and his goings on.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know,' answered Darnell, dreamily. 'On the walls of that great\r\nchurch upon the hill I saw all kinds of strange grinning monsters,\r\ncarved in stone.'\r\n\r\nThe misdemeanours of Mr. Robert Nixon brought in their train\r\nconsequences strange beyond imagination. It was not that they continued\r\nto develop on the somewhat fantastic lines of these first adventures\r\nwhich Mrs. Darnell had related; indeed, when 'Aunt Marian' came over to\r\nShepherd's Bush, one Sunday afternoon, Darnell wondered how he had had\r\nthe heart to laugh at the misfortunes of a broken-hearted woman.\r\n\r\nHe had never seen his wife's aunt before, and he was strangely surprised\r\nwhen Alice showed her into the garden where they were sitting on the\r\nwarm and misty Sunday in September. To him, save during these latter\r\ndays, she had always been associated with ideas of splendour and\r\nsuccess: his wife had always mentioned the Nixons with a tinge of\r\nreverence; he had heard, many times, the epic of Mr. Nixon's struggles\r\nand of his slow but triumphant rise. Mary had told the story as she had\r\nreceived it from her parents, beginning with the flight to London from\r\nsome small, dull, and unprosperous town in the flattest of the Midlands,\r\nlong ago, when a young man from the country had great chances of\r\nfortune. Robert Nixon's father had been a grocer in the High Street, and\r\nin after days the successful coal merchant and builder loved to tell of\r\nthat dull provincial life, and while he glorified his own victories, he\r\ngave his hearers to understand that he came of a race which had also\r\nknown how to achieve. That had been long ago, he would explain: in the\r\ndays when that rare citizen who desired to go to London or to York was\r\nforced to rise in the dead of night, and make his way, somehow or other,\r\nby ten miles of quagmirish, wandering lanes to the Great North Road,\r\nthere to meet the 'Lightning' coach, a vehicle which stood to all the\r\ncountryside as the visible and tangible embodiment of tremendous\r\nspeed--'and indeed,' as Nixon would add, 'it was always up to time,\r\nwhich is more than can be said of the Dunham Branch Line nowadays!' It\r\nwas in this ancient Dunham that the Nixons had waged successful trade\r\nfor perhaps a hundred years, in a shop with bulging bay windows looking\r\non the market-place. There was no competition, and the townsfolk, and\r\nwell-to-do farmers, the clergy and the country families, looked upon the\r\nhouse of Nixon as an institution fixed as the town hall (which stood on\r\nRoman pillars) and the parish church. But the change came: the railway\r\ncrept nearer and nearer, the farmers and the country gentry became less\r\nwell-to-do; the tanning, which was the local industry, suffered from a\r\ngreat business which had been established in a larger town, some twenty\r\nmiles away, and the profits of the Nixons grew less and less. Hence the\r\nhegira of Robert, and he would dilate on the poorness of his beginnings,\r\nhow he saved, by little and little, from his sorry wage of City clerk,\r\nand how he and a fellow clerk, 'who had come into a hundred pounds,' saw\r\nan opening in the coal trade--and filled it. It was at this stage of\r\nRobert's fortunes, still far from magnificent, that Miss Marian Reynolds\r\nhad encountered him, she being on a visit to friends in Gunnersbury.\r\nAfterwards, victory followed victory; Nixon's wharf became a landmark to\r\nbargemen; his power stretched abroad, his dusky fleets went outwards to\r\nthe sea, and inward by all the far reaches of canals. Lime, cement, and\r\nbricks were added to his merchandise, and at last he hit upon the great\r\nstroke--that extensive taking up of land in the north of London. Nixon\r\nhimself ascribed this _coup_ to native sagacity, and the possession of\r\ncapital; and there were also obscure rumours to the effect that some one\r\nor other had been 'done' in the course of the transaction. However that\r\nmight be, the Nixons grew wealthy to excess, and Mary had often told her\r\nhusband of the state in which they dwelt, of their liveried servants, of\r\nthe glories of their drawing-room, of their broad lawn, shadowed by a\r\nsplendid and ancient cedar. And so Darnell had somehow been led into\r\nconceiving the lady of this demesne as a personage of no small pomp. He\r\nsaw her, tall, of dignified port and presence, inclining, it might be,\r\nto some measure of obesity, such a measure as was not unbefitting in an\r\nelderly lady of position, who lived well and lived at ease. He even\r\nimagined a slight ruddiness of complexion, which went very well with\r\nhair that was beginning to turn grey, and when he heard the door-bell\r\nring, as he sat under the mulberry on the Sunday afternoon, he bent\r\nforward to catch sight of this stately figure, clad, of course, in the\r\nrichest, blackest silk, girt about with heavy chains of gold.\r\n\r\nHe started with amazement when he saw the strange presence that followed\r\nthe servant into the garden. Mrs. Nixon was a little, thin old woman,\r\nwho bent as she feebly trotted after Alice; her eyes were on the ground,\r\nand she did not lift them when the Darnells rose to greet her. She\r\nglanced to the right, uneasily, as she shook hands with Darnell, to the\r\nleft when Mary kissed her, and when she was placed on the garden seat\r\nwith a cushion at her back, she looked away at the back of the houses in\r\nthe next street. She was dressed in black, it was true, but even Darnell\r\ncould see that her gown was old and shabby, that the fur trimming of her\r\ncape and the fur boa which was twisted about her neck were dingy and\r\ndisconsolate, and had all the melancholy air which fur wears when it is\r\nseen in a second-hand clothes-shop in a back street. And her\r\ngloves--they were black kid, wrinkled with much wear, faded to a bluish\r\nhue at the finger-tips, which showed signs of painful mending. Her hair,\r\nplastered over her forehead, looked dull and colourless, though some\r\ngreasy matter had evidently been used with a view of producing a\r\nbecoming gloss, and on it perched an antique bonnet, adorned with black\r\npendants that rattled paralytically one against the other.\r\n\r\nAnd there was nothing in Mrs. Nixon's face to correspond with the\r\nimaginary picture that Darnell had made of her. She was sallow,\r\nwrinkled, pinched; her nose ran to a sharp point, and her red-rimmed\r\neyes were a queer water-grey, that seemed to shrink alike from the light\r\nand from encounter with the eyes of others. As she sat beside his wife\r\non the green garden-seat, Darnell, who occupied a wicker-chair brought\r\nout from the drawing-room, could not help feeling that this shadowy and\r\nevasive figure, muttering replies to Mary's polite questions, was almost\r\nimpossibly remote from his conceptions of the rich and powerful aunt,\r\nwho could give away a hundred pounds as a mere birthday gift. She would\r\nsay little at first; yes, she was feeling rather tired, it had been so\r\nhot all the way, and she had been afraid to put on lighter things as\r\none never knew at this time of year what it might be like in the\r\nevenings; there were apt to be cold mists when the sun went down, and\r\nshe didn't care to risk bronchitis.\r\n\r\n'I thought I should never get here,' she went on, raising her voice to\r\nan odd querulous pipe. 'I'd no notion it was such an out-of-the-way\r\nplace, it's so many years since I was in this neighbourhood.'\r\n\r\nShe wiped her eyes, no doubt thinking of the early days at Turnham\r\nGreen, when she married Nixon; and when the pocket-handkerchief had done\r\nits office she replaced it in a shabby black bag which she clutched\r\nrather than carried. Darnell noticed, as he watched her, that the bag\r\nseemed full, almost to bursting, and he speculated idly as to the nature\r\nof its contents: correspondence, perhaps, he thought, further proofs of\r\nUncle Robert's treacherous and wicked dealings. He grew quite\r\nuncomfortable, as he sat and saw her glancing all the while furtively\r\naway from his wife and himself, and presently he got up and strolled\r\naway to the other end of the garden, where he lit his pipe and walked to\r\nand fro on the gravel walk, still astounded at the gulf between the real\r\nand the imagined woman.\r\n\r\nPresently he heard a hissing whisper, and he saw Mrs. Nixon's head\r\ninclining to his wife's. Mary rose and came towards him.\r\n\r\n'Would you mind sitting in the drawing-room, Edward?' she murmured.\r\n'Aunt says she can't bring herself to discuss such a delicate matter\r\nbefore you. I dare say it's quite natural.'\r\n\r\n'Very well, but I don't think I'll go into the drawing-room. I feel as\r\nif a walk would do me good. You mustn't be frightened if I am a little\r\nlate,' he said; 'if I don't get back before your aunt goes, say good-bye\r\nto her for me.'\r\n\r\nHe strolled into the main road, where the trams were humming to and fro.\r\nHe was still confused and perplexed, and he tried to account for a\r\ncertain relief he felt in removing himself from the presence of Mrs.\r\nNixon. He told himself that her grief at her husband's ruffianly conduct\r\nwas worthy of all pitiful respect, but at the same time, to his shame,\r\nhe had felt a certain physical aversion from her as she sat in his\r\ngarden in her dingy black, dabbing her red-rimmed eyes with a damp\r\npocket-handkerchief. He had been to the Zoo when he was a lad, and he\r\nstill remembered how he had shrunk with horror at the sight of certain\r\nreptiles slowly crawling over one another in their slimy pond. But he\r\nwas enraged at the similarity between the two sensations, and he walked\r\nbriskly on that level and monotonous road, looking about him at the\r\nunhandsome spectacle of suburban London keeping Sunday.\r\n\r\nThere was something in the tinge of antiquity which still exists in\r\nActon that soothed his mind and drew it away from those unpleasant\r\ncontemplations, and when at last he had penetrated rampart after rampart\r\nof brick, and heard no more the harsh shrieks and laughter of the people\r\nwho were enjoying themselves, he found a way into a little sheltered\r\nfield, and sat down in peace beneath a tree, whence he could look out on\r\na pleasant valley. The sun sank down beneath the hills, the clouds\r\nchanged into the likeness of blossoming rose-gardens; and he still sat\r\nthere in the gathering darkness till a cool breeze blew upon him, and\r\nhe rose with a sigh, and turned back to the brick ramparts and the\r\nglimmering streets, and the noisy idlers sauntering to and fro in the\r\nprocession of their dismal festival. But he was murmuring to himself\r\nsome words that seemed a magic song, and it was with uplifted heart that\r\nhe let himself into his house.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nixon had gone an hour and a half before his return, Mary told him.\r\nDarnell sighed with relief, and he and his wife strolled out into the\r\ngarden and sat down side by side.\r\n\r\nThey kept silence for a time, and at last Mary spoke, not without a\r\nnervous tremor in her voice.\r\n\r\n'I must tell you, Edward,' she began, 'that aunt has made a proposal\r\nwhich you ought to hear. I think we should consider it.'\r\n\r\n'A proposal? But how about the whole affair? Is it still going on?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes! She told me all about it. Uncle is quite unrepentant. It seems\r\nhe has taken a flat somewhere in town for that woman, and furnished it\r\nin the most costly manner. He simply laughs at aunt's reproaches, and\r\nsays he means to have some fun at last. You saw how broken she was?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; very sad. But won't he give her any money? Wasn't she very badly\r\ndressed for a woman in her position?'\r\n\r\n'Aunt has no end of beautiful things, but I fancy she likes to hoard\r\nthem; she has a horror of spoiling her dresses. It isn't for want of\r\nmoney, I assure you, as uncle settled a very large sum on her two years\r\nago, when he was everything that could be desired as a husband. And that\r\nbrings me to what I want to say. Aunt would like to live with us. She\r\nwould pay very liberally. What do you say?'\r\n\r\n'Would like to live with us?' exclaimed Darnell, and his pipe dropped\r\nfrom his hand on to the grass. He was stupefied by the thought of Aunt\r\nMarian as a boarder, and sat staring vacantly before him, wondering what\r\nnew monster the night would next produce.\r\n\r\n'I knew you wouldn't much like the idea,' his wife went on. 'But I do\r\nthink, dearest, that we ought not to refuse without very serious\r\nconsideration. I am afraid you did not take to poor aunt very much.'\r\n\r\nDarnell shook his head dumbly.\r\n\r\n'I thought you didn't; she was so upset, poor thing, and you didn't see\r\nher at her best. She is really so good. But listen to me, dear. Do you\r\nthink we have the right to refuse her offer? I told you she has money of\r\nher own, and I am sure she would be dreadfully offended if we said we\r\nwouldn't have her. And what would become of me if anything happened to\r\nyou? You know we have very little saved.'\r\n\r\nDarnell groaned.\r\n\r\n'It seems to me,' he said, 'that it would spoil everything. We are so\r\nhappy, Mary dear, by ourselves. Of course I am extremely sorry for your\r\naunt. I think she is very much to be pitied. But when it comes to having\r\nher always here----'\r\n\r\n'I know, dear. Don't think I am looking forward to the prospect; you\r\nknow I don't want anybody but you. Still, we ought to think of the\r\nfuture, and besides we shall be able to live so very much better. I\r\nshall be able to give you all sorts of nice things that I know you ought\r\nto have after all that hard work in the City. Our income would be\r\ndoubled.'\r\n\r\n'Do you mean she would pay us L150 a year?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly. And she would pay for the spare room being furnished, and\r\nany extra she might want. She told me, specially, that if a friend or\r\ntwo came now and again to see her, she would gladly bear the cost of a\r\nfire in the drawing-room, and give something towards the gas bill, with\r\na few shillings for the girl for any additional trouble. We should\r\ncertainly be more than twice as well off as we are now. You see, Edward,\r\ndear, it's not the sort of offer we are likely to have again. Besides,\r\nwe must think of the future, as I said. Do you know aunt took a great\r\nfancy to you?'\r\n\r\nHe shuddered and said nothing, and his wife went on with her argument.\r\n\r\n'And, you see, it isn't as if we should see so very much of her. She\r\nwill have her breakfast in bed, and she told me she would often go up to\r\nher room in the evening directly after dinner. I thought that very nice\r\nand considerate. She quite understands that we shouldn't like to have a\r\nthird person always with us. Don't you think, Edward, that, considering\r\neverything, we ought to say we will have her?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I suppose so,' he groaned. 'As you say, it's a very good offer,\r\nfinancially, and I am afraid it would be very imprudent to refuse. But I\r\ndon't like the notion, I confess.'\r\n\r\n'I am so glad you agree with me, dear. Depend upon it, it won't be half\r\nso bad as you think. And putting our own advantage on one side, we shall\r\nreally be doing poor aunt a very great kindness. Poor old dear, she\r\ncried bitterly after you were gone; she said she had made up her mind\r\nnot to stay any longer in Uncle Robert's house, and she didn't know\r\nwhere to go, or what would become of her, if we refused to take her in.\r\nShe quite broke down.'\r\n\r\n'Well, well; we will try it for a year, anyhow. It may be as you say; we\r\nshan't find it quite so bad as it seems now. Shall we go in?'\r\n\r\nHe stooped for his pipe, which lay as it had fallen, on the grass. He\r\ncould not find it, and lit a wax match which showed him the pipe, and\r\nclose beside it, under the seat, something that looked like a page torn\r\nfrom a book. He wondered what it could be, and picked it up.\r\n\r\nThe gas was lit in the drawing-room, and Mrs. Darnell, who was arranging\r\nsome notepaper, wished to write at once to Mrs. Nixon, cordially\r\naccepting her proposal, when she was startled by an exclamation from her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n'What is the matter?' she said, startled by the tone of his voice. 'You\r\nhaven't hurt yourself?'\r\n\r\n'Look at this,' he replied, handing her a small leaflet; 'I found it\r\nunder the garden seat just now.'\r\n\r\nMary glanced with bewilderment at her husband and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n    THE NEW AND CHOSEN SEED OF ABRAHAM\r\n\r\n    PROPHECIES TO BE FULFILLED IN THE PRESENT YEAR\r\n\r\n    1. The Sailing of a Fleet of One hundred and Forty and Four Vessels\r\n    for Tarshish and the Isles.\r\n\r\n    2. Destruction of the Power of the Dog, including all the\r\n    instruments of anti-Abrahamic legislation.\r\n\r\n    3. Return of the Fleet from Tarshish, bearing with it the gold of\r\n    Arabia, destined to be the Foundation of the New City of Abraham.\r\n\r\n    4. The Search for the Bride, and the bestowing of the Seals on the\r\n    Seventy and Seven.\r\n\r\n    5. The Countenance of FATHER to become luminous, but with a greater\r\n    glory than the face of Moses.\r\n\r\n    6. The Pope of Rome to be stoned with stones in the valley called\r\n    Berek-Zittor.\r\n\r\n    7. FATHER to be acknowledged by Three Great Rulers. Two Great Rulers\r\n    will deny FATHER, and will immediately perish in the Effluvia of\r\n    FATHER'S Indignation.\r\n\r\n    8. Binding of the Beast with the Little Horn, and all Judges cast\r\n    down.\r\n\r\n    9. Finding of the Bride in the Land of Egypt, which has been\r\n    revealed to FATHER as now existing in the western part of London.\r\n\r\n    10. Bestowal of the New Tongue on the Seventy and Seven, and on the\r\n    One Hundred and Forty and Four. FATHER proceeds to the Bridal\r\n    Chamber.\r\n\r\n    11. Destruction of London and rebuilding of the City called No,\r\n    which is the New City of Abraham.\r\n\r\n    12. FATHER united to the Bride, and the present Earth removed to the\r\n    Sun for the space of half an hour.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darnell's brow cleared as she read matter which seemed to her\r\nharmless if incoherent. From her husband's voice she had been led to\r\nfear something more tangibly unpleasant than a vague catena of\r\nprophecies.\r\n\r\n'Well,' she said, 'what about it?'\r\n\r\n'What about it? Don't you see that your aunt dropped it, and that she\r\nmust be a raging lunatic?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Edward! don't say that. In the first place, how do you know that\r\naunt dropped it at all? It might easily have blown over from any of the\r\nother gardens. And, if it were hers, I don't think you should call her a\r\nlunatic. I don't believe, myself, that there are any real prophets now;\r\nbut there are many good people who think quite differently. I knew an\r\nold lady once who, I am sure, was very good, and she took in a paper\r\nevery week that was full of prophecies and things very like this. Nobody\r\ncalled her mad, and I have heard father say that she had one of the\r\nsharpest heads for business he had ever come across.'\r\n\r\n'Very good; have it as you like. But I believe we shall both be sorry.'\r\n\r\nThey sat in silence for some time. Alice came in after her 'evening\r\nout,' and they sat on, till Mrs. Darnell said she was tired and wanted\r\nto go to bed.\r\n\r\nHer husband kissed her. 'I don't think I will come up just yet,' he\r\nsaid; 'you go to sleep, dearest. I want to think things over. No, no; I\r\nam not going to change my mind: your aunt shall come, as I said. But\r\nthere are one or two things I should like to get settled in my mind.'\r\n\r\nHe meditated for a long while, pacing up and down the room. Light after\r\nlight was extinguished in Edna Road, and the people of the suburb slept\r\nall around him, but still the gas was alight in Darnell's drawing-room,\r\nand he walked softly up and down the floor. He was thinking that about\r\nthe life of Mary and himself, which had been so quiet, there seemed to\r\nbe gathering on all sides grotesque and fantastic shapes, omens of\r\nconfusion and disorder, threats of madness; a strange company from\r\nanother world. It was as if into the quiet, sleeping streets of some\r\nlittle ancient town among the hills there had come from afar the sound\r\nof drum and pipe, snatches of wild song, and there had burst into the\r\nmarket-place the mad company of the players, strangely bedizened,\r\ndancing a furious measure to their hurrying music, drawing forth the\r\ncitizens from their sheltered homes and peaceful lives, and alluring\r\nthem to mingle in the significant figures of their dance.\r\n\r\nYet afar and near (for it was hidden in his heart) he beheld the glimmer\r\nof a sure and constant star. Beneath, darkness came on, and mists and\r\nshadows closed about the town. The red, flickering flame of torches was\r\nkindled in the midst of it. The song grew louder, with more insistent,\r\nmagical tones, surging and falling in unearthly modulations, the very\r\nspeech of incantation; and the drum beat madly, and the pipe shrilled to\r\na scream, summoning all to issue forth, to leave their peaceful hearths;\r\nfor a strange rite was preconized in their midst. The streets that were\r\nwont to be so still, so hushed with the cool and tranquil veils of\r\ndarkness, asleep beneath the patronage of the evening star, now danced\r\nwith glimmering lanterns, resounded with the cries of those who hurried\r\nforth, drawn as by a magistral spell; and the songs swelled and\r\ntriumphed, the reverberant beating of the drum grew louder, and in the\r\nmidst of the awakened town the players, fantastically arrayed, performed\r\ntheir interlude under the red blaze of torches. He knew not whether they\r\nwere players, men that would vanish suddenly as they came, disappearing\r\nby the track that climbed the hill; or whether they were indeed\r\nmagicians, workers of great and efficacious spells, who knew the secret\r\nword by which the earth may be transformed into the hall of Gehenna, so\r\nthat they that gazed and listened, as at a passing spectacle, should be\r\nentrapped by the sound and the sight presented to them, should be drawn\r\ninto the elaborated figures of that mystic dance, and so should be\r\nwhirled away into those unending mazes on the wild hills that were\r\nabhorred, there to wander for evermore.\r\n\r\nBut Darnell was not afraid, because of the Daystar that had risen in his\r\nheart. It had dwelt there all his life, and had slowly shone forth with\r\nclearer and clearer light, and he began to see that though his earthly\r\nsteps might be in the ways of the ancient town that was beset by the\r\nEnchanters, and resounded with their songs and their processions, yet he\r\ndwelt also in that serene and secure world of brightness, and from a\r\ngreat and unutterable height looked on the confusion of the mortal\r\npageant, beholding mysteries in which he was no true actor, hearing\r\nmagic songs that could by no means draw him down from the battlements of\r\nthe high and holy city.\r\n\r\nHis heart was filled with a great joy and a great peace as he lay down\r\nbeside his wife and fell asleep, and in the morning, when he woke up, he\r\nwas glad.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nIn a haze as of a dream Darnell's thoughts seemed to move through the\r\nopening days of the next week. Perhaps nature had not intended that he\r\nshould be practical or much given to that which is usually called 'sound\r\ncommon sense,' but his training had made him desirous of good, plain\r\nqualities of the mind, and he uneasily strove to account to himself for\r\nhis strange mood of the Sunday night, as he had often endeavoured to\r\ninterpret the fancies of his boyhood and early manhood. At first he was\r\nannoyed by his want of success; the morning paper, which he always\r\nsecured as the 'bus delayed at Uxbridge Road Station, fell from his\r\nhands unread, while he vainly reasoned, assuring himself that the\r\nthreatened incursion of a whimsical old woman, though tiresome enough,\r\nwas no rational excuse for those curious hours of meditation in which\r\nhis thoughts seemed to have dressed themselves in unfamiliar, fantastic\r\nhabits, and to parley with him in a strange speech, and yet a speech\r\nthat he had understood.\r\n\r\nWith such arguments he perplexed his mind on the long, accustomed ride\r\nup the steep ascent of Holland Park, past the incongruous hustle of\r\nNotting Hill Gate, where in one direction a road shows the way to the\r\nsnug, somewhat faded bowers and retreats of Bayswater, and in another\r\none sees the portal of the murky region of the slums. The customary\r\ncompanions of his morning's journey were in the seats about him; he\r\nheard the hum of their talk, as they disputed concerning politics, and\r\nthe man next to him, who came from Acton, asked him what he thought of\r\nthe Government now. There was a discussion, and a loud and excited one,\r\njust in front, as to whether rhubarb was a fruit or vegetable, and in\r\nhis ear he heard Redman, who was a near neighbour, praising the economy\r\nof 'the wife.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know how she does it. Look here; what do you think we had\r\nyesterday? Breakfast: fish-cakes, beautifully fried--rich, you know,\r\nlots of herbs, it's a receipt of her aunt's; you should just taste 'em.\r\nCoffee, bread, butter, marmalade, and, of course, all the usual\r\netceteras. Dinner: roast beef, Yorkshire, potatoes, greens, and\r\nhorse-radish sauce, plum tart, cheese. And where will you get a better\r\ndinner than that? Well, I call it wonderful, I really do.'\r\n\r\nBut in spite of these distractions he fell into a dream as the 'bus\r\nrolled and tossed on its way Citywards, and still he strove to solve the\r\nenigma of his vigil of the night before, and as the shapes of trees and\r\ngreen lawns and houses passed before his eyes, and as he saw the\r\nprocession moving on the pavement, and while the murmur of the streets\r\nsounded in his ears, all was to him strange and unaccustomed, as if he\r\nmoved through the avenues of some city in a foreign land. It was,\r\nperhaps, on these mornings, as he rode to his mechanical work, that\r\nvague and floating fancies that must have long haunted his brain began\r\nto shape themselves, and to put on the form of definite conclusions,\r\nfrom which he could no longer escape, even if he had wished it. Darnell\r\nhad received what is called a sound commercial education, and would\r\ntherefore have found very great difficulty in putting into articulate\r\nspeech any thought that was worth thinking; but he grew certain on these\r\nmornings that the 'common sense' which he had always heard exalted as\r\nman's supremest faculty was, in all probability, the smallest and\r\nleast-considered item in the equipment of an ant of average\r\nintelligence. And with this, as an almost necessary corollary, came a\r\nfirm belief that the whole fabric of life in which he moved was sunken,\r\npast all thinking, in the grossest absurdity; that he and all his\r\nfriends and acquaintances and fellow-workers were interested in matters\r\nin which men were never meant to be interested, were pursuing aims which\r\nthey were never meant to pursue, were, indeed, much like fair stones of\r\nan altar serving as a pigsty wall. Life, it seemed to him, was a great\r\nsearch for--he knew not what; and in the process of the ages one by one\r\nthe true marks upon the ways had been shattered, or buried, or the\r\nmeaning of the words had been slowly forgotten; one by one the signs had\r\nbeen turned awry, the true entrances had been thickly overgrown, the\r\nvery way itself had been diverted from the heights to the depths, till\r\nat last the race of pilgrims had become hereditary stone-breakers and\r\nditch-scourers on a track that led to destruction--if it led anywhere at\r\nall. Darnell's heart thrilled with a strange and trembling joy, with a\r\nsense that was all new, when it came to his mind that this great loss\r\nmight not be a hopeless one, that perhaps the difficulties were by no\r\nmeans insuperable. It might be, he considered, that the stone-breaker\r\nhad merely to throw down his hammer and set out, and the way would be\r\nplain before him; and a single step would free the delver in rubbish\r\nfrom the foul slime of the ditch.\r\n\r\nIt was, of course, with difficulty and slowly that these things became\r\nclear to him. He was an English City clerk, 'flourishing' towards the\r\nend of the nineteenth century, and the rubbish heap that had been\r\naccumulating for some centuries could not be cleared away in an instant.\r\nAgain and again the spirit of nonsense that had been implanted in him as\r\nin his fellows assured him that the true world was the visible and\r\ntangible world, the world in which good and faithful letter-copying was\r\nexchangeable for a certain quantum of bread, beef, and house-room, and\r\nthat the man who copied letters well, did not beat his wife, nor lose\r\nmoney foolishly, was a good man, fulfilling the end for which he had\r\nbeen made. But in spite of these arguments, in spite of their acceptance\r\nby all who were about him, he had the grace to perceive the utter\r\nfalsity and absurdity of the whole position. He was fortunate in his\r\nentire ignorance of sixpenny 'science,' but if the whole library had\r\nbeen projected into his brain it would not have moved him to 'deny in\r\nthe darkness that which he had known in the light.' Darnell knew by\r\nexperience that man is made a mystery for mysteries and visions, for the\r\nrealization in his consciousness of ineffable bliss, for a great joy\r\nthat transmutes the whole world, for a joy that surpasses all joys and\r\novercomes all sorrows. He knew this certainly, though he knew it dimly;\r\nand he was apart from other men, preparing himself for a great\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nWith such thoughts as these for his secret and concealed treasure, he\r\nwas able to bear the threatened invasion of Mrs. Nixon with something\r\napproaching indifference. He knew, indeed, that her presence between\r\nhis wife and himself would be unwelcome to him, and he was not without\r\ngrave doubts as to the woman's sanity; but after all, what did it\r\nmatter? Besides, already a faint glimmering light had risen within him\r\nthat showed the profit of self-negation, and in this matter he had\r\npreferred his wife's will to his own. _Et non sua poma_; to his\r\nastonishment he found a delight in denying himself his own wish, a\r\nprocess that he had always regarded as thoroughly detestable. This was a\r\nstate of things which he could not in the least understand; but, again,\r\nthough a member of a most hopeless class, living in the most hopeless\r\nsurroundings that the world has ever seen, though he knew as much of the\r\n_askesis_ as of Chinese metaphysics; again, he had the grace not to deny\r\nthe light that had begun to glimmer in his soul.\r\n\r\nAnd he found a present reward in the eyes of Mary, when she welcomed him\r\nhome after his foolish labours in the cool of the evening. They sat\r\ntogether, hand in hand, under the mulberry tree, at the coming of the\r\ndusk, and as the ugly walls about them became obscure and vanished into\r\nthe formless world of shadows, they seemed to be freed from the bondage\r\nof Shepherd's Bush, freed to wander in that undisfigured, undefiled\r\nworld that lies beyond the walls. Of this region Mary knew little or\r\nnothing by experience, since her relations had always been of one mind\r\nwith the modern world, which has for the true country an instinctive and\r\nmost significant horror and dread. Mr. Reynolds had also shared in\r\nanother odd superstition of these later days--that it is necessary to\r\nleave London at least once a year; consequently Mary had some knowledge\r\nof various seaside resorts on the south and east coasts, where\r\nLondoners gather in hordes, turn the sands into one vast, bad\r\nmusic-hall, and derive, as they say, enormous benefit from the change.\r\nBut experiences such as these give but little knowledge of the country\r\nin its true and occult sense; and yet Mary, as she sat in the dusk\r\nbeneath the whispering tree, knew something of the secret of the wood,\r\nof the valley shut in by high hills, where the sound of pouring water\r\nalways echoes from the clear brook. And to Darnell these were nights of\r\ngreat dreams; for it was the hour of the work, the time of\r\ntransmutation, and he who could not understand the miracle, who could\r\nscarcely believe in it, yet knew, secretly and half consciously, that\r\nthe water was being changed into the wine of a new life. This was ever\r\nthe inner music of his dreams, and to it he added on these still and\r\nsacred nights the far-off memory of that time long ago when, a child,\r\nbefore the world had overwhelmed him, he journeyed down to the old grey\r\nhouse in the west, and for a whole month heard the murmur of the forest\r\nthrough his bedroom window, and when the wind was hushed, the washing of\r\nthe tides about the reeds; and sometimes awaking very early he had heard\r\nthe strange cry of a bird as it rose from its nest among the reeds, and\r\nhad looked out and had seen the valley whiten to the dawn, and the\r\nwinding river whiten as it swam down to the sea. The memory of all this\r\nhad faded and become shadowy as he grew older and the chains of common\r\nlife were riveted firmly about his soul; all the atmosphere by which he\r\nwas surrounded was well-nigh fatal to such thoughts, and only now and\r\nagain in half-conscious moments or in sleep he had revisited that valley\r\nin the far-off west, where the breath of the wind was an incantation,\r\nand every leaf and stream and hill spoke of great and ineffable\r\nmysteries. But now the broken vision was in great part restored to him,\r\nand looking with love in his wife's eyes he saw the gleam of water-pools\r\nin the still forest, saw the mists rising in the evening, and heard the\r\nmusic of the winding river.\r\n\r\nThey were sitting thus together on the Friday evening of the week that\r\nhad begun with that odd and half-forgotten visit of Mrs. Nixon, when, to\r\nDarnell's annoyance, the door-bell gave a discordant peal, and Alice\r\nwith some disturbance of manner came out and announced that a gentleman\r\nwished to see the master. Darnell went into the drawing-room, where\r\nAlice had lit one gas so that it flared and burnt with a rushing sound,\r\nand in this distorting light there waited a stout, elderly gentleman,\r\nwhose countenance was altogether unknown to him. He stared blankly, and\r\nhesitated, about to speak, but the visitor began.\r\n\r\n'You don't know who I am, but I expect you'll know my name. It's Nixon.'\r\n\r\nHe did not wait to be interrupted. He sat down and plunged into\r\nnarrative, and after the first few words, Darnell, whose mind was not\r\naltogether unprepared, listened without much astonishment.\r\n\r\n'And the long and the short of it is,' Mr. Nixon said at last, 'she's\r\ngone stark, staring mad, and we had to put her away to-day--poor thing.'\r\n\r\nHis voice broke a little, and he wiped his eyes hastily, for though\r\nstout and successful he was not unfeeling, and he was fond of his wife.\r\nHe had spoken quickly, and had gone lightly over many details which\r\nmight have interested specialists in certain kinds of mania, and\r\nDarnell was sorry for his evident distress.\r\n\r\n'I came here,' he went on after a brief pause, 'because I found out she\r\nhad been to see you last Sunday, and I knew the sort of story she must\r\nhave told.'\r\n\r\nDarnell showed him the prophetic leaflet which Mrs. Nixon had dropped in\r\nthe garden. 'Did you know about this?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Oh, _him_,' said the old man, with some approach to cheerfulness; 'oh\r\nyes, I thrashed _him_ black and blue the day before yesterday.'\r\n\r\n'Isn't he mad? Who is the man?'\r\n\r\n'He's not mad, he's bad. He's a little Welsh skunk named Richards. He's\r\nbeen running some sort of chapel over at New Barnet for the last few\r\nyears, and my poor wife--she never could find the parish church good\r\nenough for her--had been going to his damned schism shop for the last\r\ntwelve-month. It was all that finished her off. Yes; I thrashed _him_\r\nthe day before yesterday, and I'm not afraid of a summons either. I know\r\nhim, and he knows I know him.'\r\n\r\nOld Nixon whispered something in Darnell's ear, and chuckled faintly as\r\nhe repeated for the third time his formula--\r\n\r\n'I thrashed _him_ black and blue the day before yesterday.'\r\n\r\nDarnell could only murmur condolences and express his hope that Mrs.\r\nNixon might recover.\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head.\r\n\r\n'I'm afraid there's no hope of that,' he said. 'I've had the best\r\nadvice, but they couldn't do anything, and told me so.'\r\n\r\nPresently he asked to see his niece, and Darnell went out and prepared\r\nMary as well as he could. She could scarcely take in the news that her\r\naunt was a hopeless maniac, for Mrs. Nixon, having been extremely stupid\r\nall her days, had naturally succeeded in passing with her relations as\r\ntypically sensible. With the Reynolds family, as with the great majority\r\nof us, want of imagination is always equated with sanity, and though\r\nmany of us have never heard of Lombroso we are his ready-made converts.\r\nWe have always believed that poets are mad, and if statistics\r\nunfortunately show that few poets have really been inhabitants of\r\nlunatic asylums, it is soothing to learn that nearly all poets have had\r\nwhooping-cough, which is doubtless, like intoxication, a minor madness.\r\n\r\n'But is it really true?' she asked at length. 'Are you certain uncle is\r\nnot deceiving you? Aunt seemed so sensible always.'\r\n\r\nShe was helped at last by recollecting that Aunt Marian used to get up\r\nvery early of mornings, and then they went into the drawing-room and\r\ntalked to the old man. His evident kindliness and honesty grew upon\r\nMary, in spite of a lingering belief in her aunt's fables, and when he\r\nleft, it was with a promise to come to see them again.\r\n\r\nMrs. Darnell said she felt tired, and went to bed; and Darnell returned\r\nto the garden and began to pace to and fro, collecting his thoughts. His\r\nimmeasurable relief at the intelligence that, after all, Mrs. Nixon was\r\nnot coming to live with them taught him that, despite his submission,\r\nhis dread of the event had been very great. The weight was removed, and\r\nnow he was free to consider his life without reference to the grotesque\r\nintrusion that he had feared. He sighed for joy, and as he paced to and\r\nfro he savoured the scent of the night, which, though it came faintly\r\nto him in that brick-bound suburb, summoned to his mind across many\r\nyears the odour of the world at night as he had known it in that short\r\nsojourn of his boyhood; the odour that rose from the earth when the\r\nflame of the sun had gone down beyond the mountain, and the afterglow\r\nhad paled in the sky and on the fields. And as he recovered as best he\r\ncould these lost dreams of an enchanted land, there came to him other\r\nimages of his childhood, forgotten and yet not forgotten, dwelling\r\nunheeded in dark places of the memory, but ready to be summoned forth.\r\nHe remembered one fantasy that had long haunted him. As he lay half\r\nasleep in the forest on one hot afternoon of that memorable visit to the\r\ncountry, he had 'made believe' that a little companion had come to him\r\nout of the blue mists and the green light beneath the leaves--a white\r\ngirl with long black hair, who had played with him and whispered her\r\nsecrets in his ear, as his father lay sleeping under a tree; and from\r\nthat summer afternoon, day by day, she had been beside him; she had\r\nvisited him in the wilderness of London, and even in recent years there\r\nhad come to him now and again the sense of her presence, in the midst of\r\nthe heat and turmoil of the City. The last visit he remembered well; it\r\nwas a few weeks before he married, and from the depths of some futile\r\ntask he had looked up with puzzled eyes, wondering why the close air\r\nsuddenly grew scented with green leaves, why the murmur of the trees and\r\nthe wash of the river on the reeds came to his ears; and then that\r\nsudden rapture to which he had given a name and an individuality\r\npossessed him utterly. He knew then how the dull flesh of man can be\r\nlike fire; and now, looking back from a new standpoint on this and\r\nother experiences, he realized how all that was real in his life had\r\nbeen unwelcomed, uncherished by him, had come to him, perhaps, in virtue\r\nof merely negative qualities on his part. And yet, as he reflected, he\r\nsaw that there had been a chain of witnesses all through his life: again\r\nand again voices had whispered in his ear words in a strange language\r\nthat he now recognized as his native tongue; the common street had not\r\nbeen lacking in visions of the true land of his birth; and in all the\r\npassing and repassing of the world he saw that there had been emissaries\r\nready to guide his feet on the way of the great journey.\r\n\r\nA week or two after the visit of Mr. Nixon, Darnell took his annual\r\nholiday.\r\n\r\nThere was no question of Walton-on-the-Naze, or of anything of the kind,\r\nas he quite agreed with his wife's longing for some substantial sum put\r\nby against the evil day. But the weather was still fine, and he lounged\r\naway the time in his garden beneath the tree, or he sauntered out on\r\nlong aimless walks in the western purlieus of London, not unvisited by\r\nthat old sense of some great ineffable beauty, concealed by the dim and\r\ndingy veils of grey interminable streets. Once, on a day of heavy rain\r\nhe went to the 'box-room,' and began to turn over the papers in the old\r\nhair trunk--scraps and odds and ends of family history, some of them in\r\nhis father's handwriting, others in faded ink, and there were a few\r\nancient pocket-books, filled with manuscript of a still earlier time,\r\nand in these the ink was glossier and blacker than any writing fluids\r\nsupplied by stationers of later days. Darnell had hung up the portrait\r\nof the ancestor in this room, and had bought a solid kitchen table and\r\na chair; so that Mrs. Darnell, seeing him looking over his old\r\ndocuments, half thought of naming the room 'Mr. Darnell's study.' He had\r\nnot glanced at these relics of his family for many years, but from the\r\nhour when the rainy morning sent him to them, he remained constant to\r\nresearch till the end of the holidays. It was a new interest, and he\r\nbegan to fashion in his mind a faint picture of his forefathers, and of\r\ntheir life in that grey old house in the river valley, in the western\r\nland of wells and streams and dark and ancient woods. And there were\r\nstranger things than mere notes on family history amongst that odd\r\nlitter of old disregarded papers, and when he went back to his work in\r\nthe City some of the men fancied that he was in some vague manner\r\nchanged in appearance; but he only laughed when they asked him where he\r\nhad been and what he had been doing with himself. But Mary noticed that\r\nevery evening he spent at least an hour in the box-room; she was rather\r\nsorry at the waste of time involved in reading old papers about dead\r\npeople. And one afternoon, as they were out together on a somewhat\r\ndreary walk towards Acton, Darnell stopped at a hopeless second-hand\r\nbookshop, and after scanning the rows of shabby books in the window,\r\nwent in and purchased two volumes. They proved to be a Latin dictionary\r\nand grammar, and she was surprised to hear her husband declare his\r\nintention of acquiring the Latin language.\r\n\r\nBut, indeed, all his conduct impressed her as indefinably altered; and\r\nshe began to be a little alarmed, though she could scarcely have formed\r\nher fears in words. But she knew that in some way that was all\r\nindefined and beyond the grasp of her thought their lives had altered\r\nsince the summer, and no single thing wore quite the same aspect as\r\nbefore. If she looked out into the dull street with its rare loiterers,\r\nit was the same and yet it had altered, and if she opened the window in\r\nthe early morning the wind that entered came with a changed breath that\r\nspoke some message that she could not understand. And day by day passed\r\nby in the old course, and not even the four walls were altogether\r\nfamiliar, and the voices of men and women sounded with strange notes,\r\nwith the echo, rather, of a music that came over unknown hills. And day\r\nby day as she went about her household work, passing from shop to shop\r\nin those dull streets that were a network, a fatal labyrinth of grey\r\ndesolation on every side, there came to her sense half-seen images of\r\nsome other world, as if she walked in a dream, and every moment must\r\nbring her to light and to awakening, when the grey should fade, and\r\nregions long desired should appear in glory. Again and again it seemed\r\nas if that which was hidden would be shown even to the sluggish\r\ntestimony of sense; and as she went to and fro from street to street of\r\nthat dim and weary suburb, and looked on those grey material walls, they\r\nseemed as if a light glowed behind them, and again and again the mystic\r\nfragrance of incense was blown to her nostrils from across the verge of\r\nthat world which is not so much impenetrable as ineffable, and to her\r\nears came the dream of a chant that spoke of hidden choirs about all her\r\nways. She struggled against these impressions, refusing her assent to\r\nthe testimony of them, since all the pressure of credited opinion for\r\nthree hundred years has been directed towards stamping out real\r\nknowledge, and so effectually has this been accomplished that we can\r\nonly recover the truth through much anguish. And so Mary passed the days\r\nin a strange perturbation, clinging to common things and common\r\nthoughts, as if she feared that one morning she would wake up in an\r\nunknown world to a changed life. And Edward Darnell went day by day to\r\nhis labour and returned in the evening, always with that shining of\r\nlight within his eyes and upon his face, with the gaze of wonder that\r\nwas greater day by day, as if for him the veil grew thin and soon would\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nFrom these great matters both in herself and in her husband Mary shrank\r\nback, afraid, perhaps, that if she began the question the answer might\r\nbe too wonderful. She rather taught herself to be troubled over little\r\nthings; she asked herself what attraction there could be in the old\r\nrecords over which she supposed Edward to be poring night after night in\r\nthe cold room upstairs. She had glanced over the papers at Darnell's\r\ninvitation, and could see but little interest in them; there were one or\r\ntwo sketches, roughly done in pen and ink, of the old house in the west:\r\nit looked a shapeless and fantastic place, furnished with strange\r\npillars and stranger ornaments on the projecting porch; and on one side\r\na roof dipped down almost to the earth, and in the centre there was\r\nsomething that might almost be a tower rising above the rest of the\r\nbuilding. Then there were documents that seemed all names and dates,\r\nwith here and there a coat of arms done in the margin, and she came upon\r\na string of uncouth Welsh names linked together by the word 'ap' in a\r\nchain that looked endless. There was a paper covered with signs and\r\nfigures that meant nothing to her, and then there were the pocket-books,\r\nfull of old-fashioned writing, and much of it in Latin, as her husband\r\ntold her--it was a collection as void of significance as a treatise on\r\nconic sections, so far as Mary was concerned. But night after night\r\nDarnell shut himself up with the musty rolls, and more than ever when he\r\nrejoined her he bore upon his face the blazonry of some great adventure.\r\nAnd one night she asked him what interested him so much in the papers he\r\nhad shown her.\r\n\r\nHe was delighted with the question. Somehow they had not talked much\r\ntogether for the last few weeks, and he began to tell her of the records\r\nof the old race from which he came, of the old strange house of grey\r\nstone between the forest and the river. The family went back and back,\r\nhe said, far into the dim past, beyond the Normans, beyond the Saxons,\r\nfar into the Roman days, and for many hundred years they had been petty\r\nkings, with a strong fortress high up on the hill, in the heart of the\r\nforest; and even now the great mounds remained, whence one could look\r\nthrough the trees towards the mountain on one side and across the yellow\r\nsea on the other. The real name of the family was not Darnell; that was\r\nassumed by one Iolo ap Taliesin ap Iorwerth in the sixteenth\r\ncentury--why, Darnell did not seem to understand. And then he told her\r\nhow the race had dwindled in prosperity, century by century, till at\r\nlast there was nothing left but the grey house and a few acres of land\r\nbordering the river.\r\n\r\n'And do you know, Mary,' he said, 'I suppose we shall go and live there\r\nsome day or other. My great-uncle, who has the place now, made money in\r\nbusiness when he was a young man, and I believe he will leave it all to\r\nme. I know I am the only relation he has. How strange it would be. What\r\na change from the life here.'\r\n\r\n'You never told me that. Don't you think your great-uncle might leave\r\nhis house and his money to somebody he knows really well? You haven't\r\nseen him since you were a little boy, have you?'\r\n\r\n'No; but we write once a year. And from what I have heard my father say,\r\nI am sure the old man would never leave the house out of the family. Do\r\nyou think you would like it?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. Isn't it very lonely?'\r\n\r\n'I suppose it is. I forget whether there are any other houses in sight,\r\nbut I don't think there are any at all near. But what a change! No City,\r\nno streets, no people passing to and fro; only the sound of the wind and\r\nthe sight of the green leaves and the green hills, and the song of the\r\nvoices of the earth.'... He checked himself suddenly, as if he feared\r\nthat he was about to tell some secret that must not yet be uttered; and\r\nindeed, as he spoke of the change from the little street in Shepherd's\r\nBush to that ancient house in the woods of the far west, a change seemed\r\nalready to possess himself, and his voice put on the modulation of an\r\nantique chant. Mary looked at him steadily and touched his arm, and he\r\ndrew a long breath before he spoke again.\r\n\r\n'It is the old blood calling to the old land,' he said. 'I was\r\nforgetting that I am a clerk in the City.'\r\n\r\nIt was, doubtless, the old blood that had suddenly stirred in him; the\r\nresurrection of the old spirit that for many centuries had been\r\nfaithful to secrets that are now disregarded by most of us, that now day\r\nby day was quickened more and more in his heart, and grew so strong that\r\nit was hard to conceal. He was indeed almost in the position of the man\r\nin the tale, who, by a sudden electric shock, lost the vision of the\r\nthings about him in the London streets, and gazed instead upon the sea\r\nand shore of an island in the Antipodes; for Darnell only clung with an\r\neffort to the interests and the atmosphere which, till lately, had\r\nseemed all the world to him; and the grey house and the wood and the\r\nriver, symbols of the other sphere, intruded as it were into the\r\nlandscape of the London suburb.\r\n\r\nBut he went on, with more restraint, telling his stories of far-off\r\nancestors, how one of them, the most remote of all, was called a saint,\r\nand was supposed to possess certain mysterious secrets often alluded to\r\nin the papers as the 'Hidden Songs of Iolo Sant.' And then with an\r\nabrupt transition he recalled memories of his father and of the strange,\r\nshiftless life in dingy lodgings in the backwaters of London, of the dim\r\nstucco streets that were his first recollections, of forgotten squares\r\nin North London, and of the figure of his father, a grave bearded man\r\nwho seemed always in a dream, as if he too sought for the vision of a\r\nland beyond the strong walls, a land where there were deep orchards and\r\nmany shining hills, and fountains and water-pools gleaming under the\r\nleaves of the wood.\r\n\r\n'I believe my father earned his living,' he went on, 'such a living as\r\nhe did earn, at the Record Office and the British Museum. He used to\r\nhunt up things for lawyers and country parsons who wanted old deeds\r\ninspected. He never made much, and we were always moving from one\r\nlodging to another--always to out-of-the-way places where everything\r\nseemed to have run to seed. We never knew our neighbours--we moved too\r\noften for that--but my father had about half a dozen friends, elderly\r\nmen like himself, who used to come to see us pretty often; and then, if\r\nthere was any money, the lodging-house servant would go out for beer,\r\nand they would sit and smoke far into the night.\r\n\r\n'I never knew much about these friends of his, but they all had the same\r\nlook, the look of longing for something hidden. They talked of mysteries\r\nthat I never understood, very little of their own lives, and when they\r\ndid speak of ordinary affairs one could tell that they thought such\r\nmatters as money and the want of it were unimportant trifles. When I\r\ngrew up and went into the City, and met other young fellows and heard\r\ntheir way of talking, I wondered whether my father and his friends were\r\nnot a little queer in their heads; but I know better now.'\r\n\r\nSo night after night Darnell talked to his wife, seeming to wander\r\naimlessly from the dingy lodging-houses, where he had spent his boyhood\r\nin the company of his father and the other seekers, to the old house\r\nhidden in that far western valley, and the old race that had so long\r\nlooked at the setting of the sun over the mountain. But in truth there\r\nwas one end in all that he spoke, and Mary felt that beneath his words,\r\nhowever indifferent they might seem, there was hidden a purpose, that\r\nthey were to embark on a great and marvellous adventure.\r\n\r\nSo day by day the world became more magical; day by day the work of\r\nseparation was being performed, the gross accidents were being refined\r\naway. Darnell neglected no instruments that might be useful in the work;\r\nand now he neither lounged at home on Sunday mornings, nor did he\r\naccompany his wife to the Gothic blasphemy which pretended to be a\r\nchurch. They had discovered a little church of another fashion in a back\r\nstreet, and Darnell, who had found in one of the old notebooks the maxim\r\n_Incredibilia sola Credenda_, soon perceived how high and glorious a\r\nthing was that service at which he assisted. Our stupid ancestors taught\r\nus that we could become wise by studying books on 'science,' by meddling\r\nwith test-tubes, geological specimens, microscopic preparations, and the\r\nlike; but they who have cast off these follies know that they must read\r\nnot 'science' books, but mass-books, and that the soul is made wise by\r\nthe contemplation of mystic ceremonies and elaborate and curious rites.\r\nIn such things Darnell found a wonderful mystery language, which spoke\r\nat once more secretly and more directly than the formal creeds; and he\r\nsaw that, in a sense, the whole world is but a great ceremony or\r\nsacrament, which teaches under visible forms a hidden and transcendent\r\ndoctrine. It was thus that he found in the ritual of the church a\r\nperfect image of the world; an image purged, exalted, and illuminate, a\r\nholy house built up of shining and translucent stones, in which the\r\nburning torches were more significant than the wheeling stars, and the\r\nfuming incense was a more certain token than the rising of the mist. His\r\nsoul went forth with the albed procession in its white and solemn order,\r\nthe mystic dance that signifies rapture and a joy above all joys, and\r\nwhen he beheld Love slain and rise again victorious he knew that he\r\nwitnessed, in a figure, the consummation of all things, the Bridal of\r\nall Bridals, the mystery that is beyond all mysteries, accomplished from\r\nthe foundation of the world. So day by day the house of his life became\r\nmore magical.\r\n\r\nAnd at the same time he began to guess that if in the New Life there are\r\nnew and unheard-of joys, there are also new and unheard-of dangers. In\r\nhis manuscript books which professed to deliver the outer sense of those\r\nmysterious 'Hidden Songs of Iolo Sant' there was a little chapter that\r\nbore the heading: _Fons Sacer non in communem Vsum convertendus est_,\r\nand by diligence, with much use of the grammar and dictionary, Darnell\r\nwas able to construe the by no means complex Latin of his ancestor. The\r\nspecial book which contained the chapter in question was one of the most\r\nsingular in the collection, since it bore the title _Terra de Iolo_, and\r\non the surface, with an ingenious concealment of its real symbolism, it\r\naffected to give an account of the orchards, fields, woods, roads,\r\ntenements, and waterways in the possession of Darnell's ancestors. Here,\r\nthen, he read of the Holy Well, hidden in the Wistman's Wood--_Sylva\r\nSapientum_--'a fountain of abundant water, which no heats of summer can\r\never dry, which no flood can ever defile, which is as a water of life,\r\nto them that thirst for life, a stream of cleansing to them that would\r\nbe pure, and a medicine of such healing virtue that by it, through the\r\nmight of God and the intercession of His saints, the most grievous\r\nwounds are made whole.' But the water of this well was to be kept\r\nsacred perpetually, it was not to be used for any common purpose, nor to\r\nsatisfy any bodily thirst; but ever to be esteemed as holy, 'even as the\r\nwater which the priest hath hallowed.' And in the margin a comment in a\r\nlater hand taught Darnell something of the meaning of these\r\nprohibitions. He was warned not to use the Well of Life as a mere luxury\r\nof mortal life, as a new sensation, as a means of making the insipid cup\r\nof everyday existence more palatable. 'For,' said the commentator, 'we\r\nare not called to sit as the spectators in a theatre, there to watch the\r\nplay performed before us, but we are rather summoned to stand in the\r\nvery scene itself, and there fervently to enact our parts in a great and\r\nwonderful mystery.'\r\n\r\nDarnell could quite understand the temptation that was thus indicated.\r\nThough he had gone but a little way on the path, and had barely tested\r\nthe over-runnings of that mystic well, he was already aware of the\r\nenchantment that was transmuting all the world about him, informing his\r\nlife with a strange significance and romance. London seemed a city of\r\nthe Arabian Nights, and its labyrinths of streets an enchanted maze; its\r\nlong avenues of lighted lamps were as starry systems, and its immensity\r\nbecame for him an image of the endless universe. He could well imagine\r\nhow pleasant it might be to linger in such a world as this, to sit apart\r\nand dream, beholding the strange pageant played before him; but the\r\nSacred Well was not for common use, it was for the cleansing of the\r\nsoul, and the healing of the grievous wounds of the spirit. There must\r\nbe yet another transformation: London had become Bagdad; it must at\r\nlast be transmuted to Syon, or in the phrase of one of his old\r\ndocuments, the City of the Cup.\r\n\r\nAnd there were yet darker perils which the Iolo MSS. (as his father had\r\nnamed the collection) hinted at more or less obscurely. There were\r\nsuggestions of an awful region which the soul might enter, of a\r\ntransmutation that was unto death, of evocations which could summon the\r\nutmost forces of evil from their dark places--in a word, of that sphere\r\nwhich is represented to most of us under the crude and somewhat childish\r\nsymbolism of Black Magic. And here again he was not altogether without a\r\ndim comprehension of what was meant. He found himself recalling an odd\r\nincident that had happened long ago, which had remained all the years in\r\nhis mind unheeded, amongst the many insignificant recollections of his\r\nchildhood, and now rose before him, clear and distinct and full of\r\nmeaning. It was on that memorable visit to the old house in the west,\r\nand the whole scene returned, with its smallest events, and the voices\r\nseemed to sound in his ears. It was a grey, still day of heavy heat that\r\nhe remembered: he had stood on the lawn after breakfast, and wondered at\r\nthe great peace and silence of the world. Not a leaf stirred in the\r\ntrees on the lawn, not a whisper came from the myriad leaves of the\r\nwood; the flowers gave out sweet and heavy odours as if they breathed\r\nthe dreams of the summer night; and far down the valley, the winding\r\nriver was like dim silver under that dim and silvery sky, and the far\r\nhills and woods and fields vanished in the mist. The stillness of the\r\nair held him as with a charm; he leant all the morning against the rails\r\nthat parted the lawn from the meadow, breathing the mystic breath of\r\nsummer, and watching the fields brighten as with a sudden blossoming of\r\nshining flowers as the high mist grew thin for a moment before the\r\nhidden sun. As he watched thus, a man weary with heat, with some glance\r\nof horror in his eyes, passed him on his way to the house; but he stayed\r\nat his post till the old bell in the turret rang, and they dined all\r\ntogether, masters and servants, in the dark cool room that looked\r\ntowards the still leaves of the wood. He could see that his uncle was\r\nupset about something, and when they had finished dinner he heard him\r\ntell his father that there was trouble at a farm; and it was settled\r\nthat they should all drive over in the afternoon to some place with a\r\nstrange name. But when the time came Mr. Darnell was too deep in old\r\nbooks and tobacco smoke to be stirred from his corner, and Edward and\r\nhis uncle went alone in the dog-cart. They drove swiftly down the narrow\r\nlane, into the road that followed the winding river, and crossed the\r\nbridge at Caermaen by the mouldering Roman walls, and then, skirting the\r\ndeserted, echoing village, they came out on a broad white turnpike road,\r\nand the limestone dust followed them like a cloud. Then, suddenly, they\r\nturned to the north by such a road as Edward had never seen before. It\r\nwas so narrow that there was barely room for the cart to pass, and the\r\nfootway was of rock, and the banks rose high above them as they slowly\r\nclimbed the long, steep way, and the untrimmed hedges on either side\r\nshut out the light. And the ferns grew thick and green upon the banks,\r\nand hidden wells dripped down upon them; and the old man told him how\r\nthe lane in winter was a torrent of swirling water, so that no one\r\ncould pass by it. On they went, ascending and then again descending,\r\nalways in that deep hollow under the wild woven boughs, and the boy\r\nwondered vainly what the country was like on either side. And now the\r\nair grew darker, and the hedge on one bank was but the verge of a dark\r\nand rustling wood, and the grey limestone rocks had changed to dark-red\r\nearth flecked with green patches and veins of marl, and suddenly in the\r\nstillness from the depths of the wood a bird began to sing a melody that\r\ncharmed the heart into another world, that sang to the child's soul of\r\nthe blessed faery realm beyond the woods of the earth, where the wounds\r\nof man are healed. And so at last, after many turnings and windings,\r\nthey came to a high bare land where the lane broadened out into a kind\r\nof common, and along the edge of this place there were scattered three\r\nor four old cottages, and one of them was a little tavern. Here they\r\nstopped, and a man came out and tethered the tired horse to a post and\r\ngave him water; and old Mr. Darnell took the child's hand and led him by\r\na path across the fields. The boy could see the country now, but it was\r\nall a strange, undiscovered land; they were in the heart of a wilderness\r\nof hills and valleys that he had never looked upon, and they were going\r\ndown a wild, steep hillside, where the narrow path wound in and out\r\namidst gorse and towering bracken, and the sun gleaming out for a\r\nmoment, there was a gleam of white water far below in a narrow valley,\r\nwhere a little brook poured and rippled from stone to stone. They went\r\ndown the hill, and through a brake, and then, hidden in dark-green\r\norchards, they came upon a long, low whitewashed house, with a stone\r\nroof strangely coloured by the growth of moss and lichens. Mr. Darnell\r\nknocked at a heavy oaken door, and they came into a dim room where but\r\nlittle light entered through the thick glass in the deep-set window.\r\nThere were heavy beams in the ceiling, and a great fireplace sent out an\r\nodour of burning wood that Darnell never forgot, and the room seemed to\r\nhim full of women who talked all together in frightened tones. Mr.\r\nDarnell beckoned to a tall, grey old man, who wore corduroy\r\nknee-breeches, and the boy, sitting on a high straight-backed chair,\r\ncould see the old man and his uncle passing to and fro across the\r\nwindow-panes, as they walked together on the garden path. The women\r\nstopped their talk for a moment, and one of them brought him a glass of\r\nmilk and an apple from some cold inner chamber; and then, suddenly, from\r\na room above there rang out a shrill and terrible shriek, and then, in a\r\nyoung girl's voice, a more terrible song. It was not like anything the\r\nchild had ever heard, but as the man recalled it to his memory, he knew\r\nto what song it might be compared--to a certain chant indeed that\r\nsummons the angels and archangels to assist in the great Sacrifice. But\r\nas this song chants of the heavenly army, so did that seem to summon all\r\nthe hierarchy of evil, the hosts of Lilith and Samael; and the words\r\nthat rang out with such awful modulations--_neumata inferorum_--were in\r\nsome unknown tongue that few men have ever heard on earth.\r\n\r\nThe women glared at one another with horror in their eyes, and he saw\r\none or two of the oldest of them clumsily making an old sign upon their\r\nbreasts. Then they began to speak again, and he remembered fragments of\r\ntheir talk.\r\n\r\n'She has been up there,' said one, pointing vaguely over her shoulder.\r\n\r\n'She'd never know the way,' answered another. 'They be all gone that\r\nwent there.'\r\n\r\n'There be nought there in these days.'\r\n\r\n'How can you tell that, Gwenllian? 'Tis not for us to say that.'\r\n\r\n'My great-grandmother did know some that had been there,' said a very\r\nold woman. 'She told me how they was taken afterwards.'\r\n\r\nAnd then his uncle appeared at the door, and they went their way as they\r\nhad come. Edward Darnell never heard any more of it, nor whether the\r\ngirl died or recovered from her strange attack; but the scene had\r\nhaunted his mind in boyhood, and now the recollection of it came to him\r\nwith a certain note of warning, as a symbol of dangers that might be in\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to carry on the history of Edward Darnell and of\r\nMary his wife to a greater length, since from this point their legend is\r\nfull of impossible events, and seems to put on the semblance of the\r\nstories of the Graal. It is certain, indeed, that in this world they\r\nchanged their lives, like King Arthur, but this is a work which no\r\nchronicler has cared to describe with any amplitude of detail. Darnell,\r\nit is true, made a little book, partly consisting of queer verse which\r\nmight have been written by an inspired infant, and partly made up of\r\n'notes and exclamations' in an odd dog-Latin which he had picked up\r\nfrom the 'Iolo MSS.', but it is to be feared that this work, even if\r\npublished in its entirety, would cast but little light on a perplexing\r\nstory. He called this piece of literature 'In Exitu Israel,' and wrote\r\non the title page the motto, doubtless of his own composition, '_Nunc\r\ncerte scio quod omnia legenda; omnes historiae, omnes fabulae, omnis\r\nScriptura sint de ME narrata_.' It is only too evident that his Latin\r\nwas not learnt at the feet of Cicero; but in this dialect he relates the\r\ngreat history of the 'New Life' as it was manifested to him. The 'poems'\r\nare even stranger. One, headed (with an odd reminiscence of\r\nold-fashioned books) 'Lines written on looking down from a Height in\r\nLondon on a Board School suddenly lit up by the Sun' begins thus:--\r\n\r\n    One day when I was all alone\r\n    I found a wondrous little stone,\r\n    It lay forgotten on the road\r\n    Far from the ways of man's abode.\r\n    When on this stone mine eyes I cast\r\n    I saw my Treasure found at last.\r\n    I pressed it hard against my face,\r\n    I covered it with my embrace,\r\n    I hid it in a secret place.\r\n    And every day I went to see\r\n    This stone that was my ecstasy;\r\n    And worshipped it with flowers rare,\r\n    And secret words and sayings fair.\r\n    O stone, so rare and red and wise\r\n    O fragment of far Paradise,\r\n    O Star, whose light is life! O Sea,\r\n    Whose ocean is infinity!\r\n    Thou art a fire that ever burns,\r\n    And all the world to wonder turns;\r\n    And all the dust of the dull day\r\n    By thee is changed and purged away,\r\n    So that, where'er I look, I see\r\n    A world of a Great Majesty.\r\n    The sullen river rolls all gold,\r\n    The desert park's a faery wold,\r\n    When on the trees the wind is borne\r\n    I hear the sound of Arthur's horn\r\n    I see no town of grim grey ways,\r\n    But a great city all ablaze\r\n    With burning torches, to light up\r\n    The pinnacles that shrine the Cup.\r\n    Ever the magic wine is poured,\r\n    Ever the Feast shines on the board,\r\n    Ever the song is borne on high\r\n    That chants the holy Magistry--\r\n      Etc. etc. etc.\r\n\r\nFrom such documents as these it is clearly impossible to gather any very\r\ndefinite information. But on the last page Darnell has written--\r\n\r\n'So I awoke from a dream of a London suburb, of daily labour, of weary,\r\nuseless little things; and as my eyes were opened I saw that I was in an\r\nancient wood, where a clear well rose into grey film and vapour beneath\r\na misty, glimmering heat. And a form came towards me from the hidden\r\nplaces of the wood, and my love and I were united by the well.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White People\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLOGUE\r\n\r\n'Sorcery and sanctity,' said Ambrose, 'these are the only realities.\r\nEach is an ecstasy, a withdrawal from the common life.'\r\n\r\nCotgrave listened, interested. He had been brought by a friend to this\r\nmouldering house in a northern suburb, through an old garden to the room\r\nwhere Ambrose the recluse dozed and dreamed over his books.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he went on, 'magic is justified of her children. There are many,\r\nI think, who eat dry crusts and drink water, with a joy infinitely\r\nsharper than anything within the experience of the \"practical\" epicure.'\r\n\r\n'You are speaking of the saints?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, and of the sinners, too. I think you are falling into the very\r\ngeneral error of confining the spiritual world to the supremely good;\r\nbut the supremely wicked, necessarily, have their portion in it. The\r\nmerely carnal, sensual man can no more be a great sinner than he can be\r\na great saint. Most of us are just indifferent, mixed-up creatures; we\r\nmuddle through the world without realizing the meaning and the inner\r\nsense of things, and, consequently, our wickedness and our goodness are\r\nalike second-rate, unimportant.'\r\n\r\n'And you think the great sinner, then, will be an ascetic, as well as\r\nthe great saint?'\r\n\r\n'Great people of all kinds forsake the imperfect copies and go to the\r\nperfect originals. I have no doubt but that many of the very highest\r\namong the saints have never done a \"good action\" (using the words in\r\ntheir ordinary sense). And, on the other hand, there have been those who\r\nhave sounded the very depths of sin, who all their lives have never done\r\nan \"ill deed.\"'\r\n\r\nHe went out of the room for a moment, and Cotgrave, in high delight,\r\nturned to his friend and thanked him for the introduction.\r\n\r\n'He's grand,' he said. 'I never saw that kind of lunatic before.'\r\n\r\nAmbrose returned with more whisky and helped the two men in a liberal\r\nmanner. He abused the teetotal sect with ferocity, as he handed the\r\nseltzer, and pouring out a glass of water for himself, was about to\r\nresume his monologue, when Cotgrave broke in--\r\n\r\n'I can't stand it, you know,' he said, 'your paradoxes are too\r\nmonstrous. A man may be a great sinner and yet never do anything sinful!\r\nCome!'\r\n\r\n'You're quite wrong,' said Ambrose. 'I never make paradoxes; I wish I\r\ncould. I merely said that a man may have an exquisite taste in Romanee\r\nConti, and yet never have even smelt four ale. That's all, and it's more\r\nlike a truism than a paradox, isn't it? Your surprise at my remark is\r\ndue to the fact that you haven't realized what sin is. Oh, yes, there is\r\na sort of connexion between Sin with the capital letter, and actions\r\nwhich are commonly called sinful: with murder, theft, adultery, and so\r\nforth. Much the same connexion that there is between the A, B, C and\r\nfine literature. But I believe that the misconception--it is all but\r\nuniversal--arises in great measure from our looking at the matter\r\nthrough social spectacles. We think that a man who does evil to _us_ and\r\nto his neighbours must be very evil. So he is, from a social standpoint;\r\nbut can't you realize that Evil in its essence is a lonely thing, a\r\npassion of the solitary, individual soul? Really, the average murderer,\r\n_qua_ murderer, is not by any means a sinner in the true sense of the\r\nword. He is simply a wild beast that we have to get rid of to save our\r\nown necks from his knife. I should class him rather with tigers than\r\nwith sinners.'\r\n\r\n'It seems a little strange.'\r\n\r\n'I think not. The murderer murders not from positive qualities, but from\r\nnegative ones; he lacks something which non-murderers possess. Evil, of\r\ncourse, is wholly positive--only it is on the wrong side. You may\r\nbelieve me that sin in its proper sense is very rare; it is probable\r\nthat there have been far fewer sinners than saints. Yes, your standpoint\r\nis all very well for practical, social purposes; we are naturally\r\ninclined to think that a person who is very disagreeable to us must be a\r\nvery great sinner! It is very disagreeable to have one's pocket picked,\r\nand we pronounce the thief to be a very great sinner. In truth, he is\r\nmerely an undeveloped man. He cannot be a saint, of course; but he may\r\nbe, and often is, an infinitely better creature than thousands who have\r\nnever broken a single commandment. He is a great nuisance to _us_, I\r\nadmit, and we very properly lock him up if we catch him; but between his\r\ntroublesome and unsocial action and evil--Oh, the connexion is of the\r\nweakest.'\r\n\r\nIt was getting very late. The man who had brought Cotgrave had probably\r\nheard all this before, since he assisted with a bland and judicious\r\nsmile, but Cotgrave began to think that his 'lunatic' was turning into a\r\nsage.\r\n\r\n'Do you know,' he said, 'you interest me immensely? You think, then,\r\nthat we do not understand the real nature of evil?'\r\n\r\n'No, I don't think we do. We over-estimate it and we under-estimate it.\r\nWe take the very numerous infractions of our social \"bye-laws\"--the very\r\nnecessary and very proper regulations which keep the human company\r\ntogether--and we get frightened at the prevalence of \"sin\" and \"evil.\"\r\nBut this is really nonsense. Take theft, for example. Have you any\r\n_horror_ at the thought of Robin Hood, of the Highland caterans of the\r\nseventeenth century, of the moss-troopers, of the company promoters of\r\nour day?\r\n\r\n'Then, on the other hand, we underrate evil. We attach such an enormous\r\nimportance to the \"sin\" of meddling with our pockets (and our wives)\r\nthat we have quite forgotten the awfulness of real sin.'\r\n\r\n'And what is sin?' said Cotgrave.\r\n\r\n'I think I must reply to your question by another. What would your\r\nfeelings be, seriously, if your cat or your dog began to talk to you,\r\nand to dispute with you in human accents? You would be overwhelmed with\r\nhorror. I am sure of it. And if the roses in your garden sang a weird\r\nsong, you would go mad. And suppose the stones in the road began to\r\nswell and grow before your eyes, and if the pebble that you noticed at\r\nnight had shot out stony blossoms in the morning?\r\n\r\n'Well, these examples may give you some notion of what sin really is.'\r\n\r\n'Look here,' said the third man, hitherto placid, 'you two seem pretty\r\nwell wound up. But I'm going home. I've missed my tram, and I shall have\r\nto walk.'\r\n\r\nAmbrose and Cotgrave seemed to settle down more profoundly when the\r\nother had gone out into the early misty morning and the pale light of\r\nthe lamps.\r\n\r\n'You astonish me,' said Cotgrave. 'I had never thought of that. If that\r\nis really so, one must turn everything upside down. Then the essence of\r\nsin really is----'\r\n\r\n'In the taking of heaven by storm, it seems to me,' said Ambrose. 'It\r\nappears to me that it is simply an attempt to penetrate into another and\r\nhigher sphere in a forbidden manner. You can understand why it is so\r\nrare. There are few, indeed, who wish to penetrate into other spheres,\r\nhigher or lower, in ways allowed or forbidden. Men, in the mass, are\r\namply content with life as they find it. Therefore there are few saints,\r\nand sinners (in the proper sense) are fewer still, and men of genius,\r\nwho partake sometimes of each character, are rare also. Yes; on the\r\nwhole, it is, perhaps, harder to be a great sinner than a great saint.'\r\n\r\n'There is something profoundly unnatural about sin? Is that what you\r\nmean?'\r\n\r\n'Exactly. Holiness requires as great, or almost as great, an effort; but\r\nholiness works on lines that _were_ natural once; it is an effort to\r\nrecover the ecstasy that was before the Fall. But sin is an effort to\r\ngain the ecstasy and the knowledge that pertain alone to angels, and in\r\nmaking this effort man becomes a demon. I told you that the mere\r\nmurderer is not _therefore_ a sinner; that is true, but the sinner is\r\nsometimes a murderer. Gilles de Raiz is an instance. So you see that\r\nwhile the good and the evil are unnatural to man as he now is--to man\r\nthe social, civilized being--evil is unnatural in a much deeper sense\r\nthan good. The saint endeavours to recover a gift which he has lost; the\r\nsinner tries to obtain something which was never his. In brief, he\r\nrepeats the Fall.'\r\n\r\n'But are you a Catholic?' said Cotgrave.\r\n\r\n'Yes; I am a member of the persecuted Anglican Church.'\r\n\r\n'Then, how about those texts which seem to reckon as sin that which you\r\nwould set down as a mere trivial dereliction?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; but in one place the word \"sorcerers\" comes in the same sentence,\r\ndoesn't it? That seems to me to give the key-note. Consider: can you\r\nimagine for a moment that a false statement which saves an innocent\r\nman's life is a sin? No; very good, then, it is not the mere liar who is\r\nexcluded by those words; it is, above all, the \"sorcerers\" who use the\r\nmaterial life, who use the failings incidental to material life as\r\ninstruments to obtain their infinitely wicked ends. And let me tell you\r\nthis: our higher senses are so blunted, we are so drenched with\r\nmaterialism, that we should probably fail to recognize real wickedness\r\nif we encountered it.'\r\n\r\n'But shouldn't we experience a certain horror--a terror such as you\r\nhinted we would experience if a rose tree sang--in the mere presence of\r\nan evil man?'\r\n\r\n'We should if we were natural: children and women feel this horror you\r\nspeak of, even animals experience it. But with most of us convention and\r\ncivilization and education have blinded and deafened and obscured the\r\nnatural reason. No, sometimes we may recognize evil by its hatred of the\r\ngood--one doesn't need much penetration to guess at the influence which\r\ndictated, quite unconsciously, the \"Blackwood\" review of Keats--but this\r\nis purely incidental; and, as a rule, I suspect that the Hierarchs of\r\nTophet pass quite unnoticed, or, perhaps, in certain cases, as good but\r\nmistaken men.'\r\n\r\n'But you used the word \"unconscious\" just now, of Keats' reviewers. Is\r\nwickedness ever unconscious?'\r\n\r\n'Always. It must be so. It is like holiness and genius in this as in\r\nother points; it is a certain rapture or ecstasy of the soul; a\r\ntranscendent effort to surpass the ordinary bounds. So, surpassing\r\nthese, it surpasses also the understanding, the faculty that takes note\r\nof that which comes before it. No, a man may be infinitely and horribly\r\nwicked and never suspect it. But I tell you, evil in this, its certain\r\nand true sense, is rare, and I think it is growing rarer.'\r\n\r\n'I am trying to get hold of it all,' said Cotgrave. 'From what you say,\r\nI gather that the true evil differs generically from that which we call\r\nevil?'\r\n\r\n'Quite so. There is, no doubt, an analogy between the two; a resemblance\r\nsuch as enables us to use, quite legitimately, such terms as the \"foot\r\nof the mountain\" and the \"leg of the table.\" And, sometimes, of course,\r\nthe two speak, as it were, in the same language. The rough miner, or\r\n\"puddler,\" the untrained, undeveloped \"tiger-man,\" heated by a quart or\r\ntwo above his usual measure, comes home and kicks his irritating and\r\ninjudicious wife to death. He is a murderer. And Gilles de Raiz was a\r\nmurderer. But you see the gulf that separates the two? The \"word,\" if I\r\nmay so speak, is accidentally the same in each case, but the \"meaning\"\r\nis utterly different. It is flagrant \"Hobson Jobson\" to confuse the two,\r\nor rather, it is as if one supposed that Juggernaut and the Argonauts\r\nhad something to do etymologically with one another. And no doubt the\r\nsame weak likeness, or analogy, runs between all the \"social\" sins and\r\nthe real spiritual sins, and in some cases, perhaps, the lesser may be\r\n\"schoolmasters\" to lead one on to the greater--from the shadow to the\r\nreality. If you are anything of a Theologian, you will see the\r\nimportance of all this.'\r\n\r\n'I am sorry to say,' remarked Cotgrave, 'that I have devoted very little\r\nof my time to theology. Indeed, I have often wondered on what grounds\r\ntheologians have claimed the title of Science of Sciences for their\r\nfavourite study; since the \"theological\" books I have looked into have\r\nalways seemed to me to be concerned with feeble and obvious pieties, or\r\nwith the kings of Israel and Judah. I do not care to hear about those\r\nkings.'\r\n\r\nAmbrose grinned.\r\n\r\n'We must try to avoid theological discussion,' he said. 'I perceive that\r\nyou would be a bitter disputant. But perhaps the \"dates of the kings\"\r\nhave as much to do with theology as the hobnails of the murderous\r\npuddler with evil.'\r\n\r\n'Then, to return to our main subject, you think that sin is an esoteric,\r\noccult thing?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. It is the infernal miracle as holiness is the supernal. Now and\r\nthen it is raised to such a pitch that we entirely fail to suspect its\r\nexistence; it is like the note of the great pedal pipes of the organ,\r\nwhich is so deep that we cannot hear it. In other cases it may lead to\r\nthe lunatic asylum, or to still stranger issues. But you must never\r\nconfuse it with mere social misdoing. Remember how the Apostle, speaking\r\nof the \"other side,\" distinguishes between \"charitable\" actions and\r\ncharity. And as one may give all one's goods to the poor, and yet lack\r\ncharity; so, remember, one may avoid every crime and yet be a sinner.'\r\n\r\n'Your psychology is very strange to me,' said Cotgrave, 'but I confess I\r\nlike it, and I suppose that one might fairly deduce from your premisses\r\nthe conclusion that the real sinner might very possibly strike the\r\nobserver as a harmless personage enough?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly; because the true evil has nothing to do with social life or\r\nsocial laws, or if it has, only incidentally and accidentally. It is a\r\nlonely passion of the soul--or a passion of the lonely soul--whichever\r\nyou like. If, by chance, we understand it, and grasp its full\r\nsignificance, then, indeed, it will fill us with horror and with awe.\r\nBut this emotion is widely distinguished from the fear and the disgust\r\nwith which we regard the ordinary criminal, since this latter is largely\r\nor entirely founded on the regard which we have for our own skins or\r\npurses. We hate a murderer, because we know that we should hate to be\r\nmurdered, or to have any one that we like murdered. So, on the \"other\r\nside,\" we venerate the saints, but we don't \"like\" them as we like our\r\nfriends. Can you persuade yourself that you would have \"enjoyed\" St.\r\nPaul's company? Do you think that you and I would have \"got on\" with Sir\r\nGalahad?\r\n\r\n'So with the sinners, as with the saints. If you met a very evil man,\r\nand recognized his evil; he would, no doubt, fill you with horror and\r\nawe; but there is no reason why you should \"dislike\" him. On the\r\ncontrary, it is quite possible that if you could succeed in putting the\r\nsin out of your mind you might find the sinner capital company, and in a\r\nlittle while you might have to reason yourself back into horror. Still,\r\nhow awful it is. If the roses and the lilies suddenly sang on this\r\ncoming morning; if the furniture began to move in procession, as in De\r\nMaupassant's tale!'\r\n\r\n'I am glad you have come back to that comparison,' said Cotgrave,\r\n'because I wanted to ask you what it is that corresponds in humanity to\r\nthese imaginary feats of inanimate things. In a word--what is sin? You\r\nhave given me, I know, an abstract definition, but I should like a\r\nconcrete example.'\r\n\r\n'I told you it was very rare,' said Ambrose, who appeared willing to\r\navoid the giving of a direct answer. 'The materialism of the age, which\r\nhas done a good deal to suppress sanctity, has done perhaps more to\r\nsuppress evil. We find the earth so very comfortable that we have no\r\ninclination either for ascents or descents. It would seem as if the\r\nscholar who decided to \"specialize\" in Tophet, would be reduced to\r\npurely antiquarian researches. No palaeontologist could show you a _live_\r\npterodactyl.'\r\n\r\n'And yet you, I think, have \"specialized,\" and I believe that your\r\nresearches have descended to our modern times.'\r\n\r\n'You are really interested, I see. Well, I confess, that I have dabbled\r\na little, and if you like I can show you something that bears on the\r\nvery curious subject we have been discussing.'\r\n\r\nAmbrose took a candle and went away to a far, dim corner of the room.\r\nCotgrave saw him open a venerable bureau that stood there, and from some\r\nsecret recess he drew out a parcel, and came back to the window where\r\nthey had been sitting.\r\n\r\nAmbrose undid a wrapping of paper, and produced a green pocket-book.\r\n\r\n'You will take care of it?' he said. 'Don't leave it lying about. It is\r\none of the choicer pieces in my collection, and I should be very sorry\r\nif it were lost.'\r\n\r\nHe fondled the faded binding.\r\n\r\n'I knew the girl who wrote this,' he said. 'When you read it, you will\r\nsee how it illustrates the talk we have had to-night. There is a sequel,\r\ntoo, but I won't talk of that.'\r\n\r\n'There was an odd article in one of the reviews some months ago,' he\r\nbegan again, with the air of a man who changes the subject. 'It was\r\nwritten by a doctor--Dr. Coryn, I think, was the name. He says that a\r\nlady, watching her little girl playing at the drawing-room window,\r\nsuddenly saw the heavy sash give way and fall on the child's fingers.\r\nThe lady fainted, I think, but at any rate the doctor was summoned, and\r\nwhen he had dressed the child's wounded and maimed fingers he was\r\nsummoned to the mother. She was groaning with pain, and it was found\r\nthat three fingers of her hand, corresponding with those that had been\r\ninjured on the child's hand, were swollen and inflamed, and later, in\r\nthe doctor's language, purulent sloughing set in.'\r\n\r\nAmbrose still handled delicately the green volume.\r\n\r\n'Well, here it is,' he said at last, parting with difficulty, it seemed,\r\nfrom his treasure.\r\n\r\n'You will bring it back as soon as you have read it,' he said, as they\r\nwent out into the hall, into the old garden, faint with the odour of\r\nwhite lilies.\r\n\r\nThere was a broad red band in the east as Cotgrave turned to go, and\r\nfrom the high ground where he stood he saw that awful spectacle of\r\nLondon in a dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN BOOK\r\n\r\nThe morocco binding of the book was faded, and the colour had grown\r\nfaint, but there were no stains nor bruises nor marks of usage. The book\r\nlooked as if it had been bought 'on a visit to London' some seventy or\r\neighty years ago, and had somehow been forgotten and suffered to lie\r\naway out of sight. There was an old, delicate, lingering odour about it,\r\nsuch an odour as sometimes haunts an ancient piece of furniture for a\r\ncentury or more. The end-papers, inside the binding, were oddly\r\ndecorated with coloured patterns and faded gold. It looked small, but\r\nthe paper was fine, and there were many leaves, closely covered with\r\nminute, painfully formed characters.\r\n\r\nI found this book (the manuscript began) in a drawer in the old bureau\r\nthat stands on the landing. It was a very rainy day and I could not go\r\nout, so in the afternoon I got a candle and rummaged in the bureau.\r\nNearly all the drawers were full of old dresses, but one of the small\r\nones looked empty, and I found this book hidden right at the back. I\r\nwanted a book like this, so I took it to write in. It is full of\r\nsecrets. I have a great many other books of secrets I have written,\r\nhidden in a safe place, and I am going to write here many of the old\r\nsecrets and some new ones; but there are some I shall not put down at\r\nall. I must not write down the real names of the days and months which I\r\nfound out a year ago, nor the way to make the Aklo letters, or the Chian\r\nlanguage, or the great beautiful Circles, nor the Mao Games, nor the\r\nchief songs. I may write something about all these things but not the\r\nway to do them, for peculiar reasons. And I must not say who the Nymphs\r\nare, or the Dols, or Jeelo, or what voolas mean. All these are most\r\nsecret secrets, and I am glad when I remember what they are, and how\r\nmany wonderful languages I know, but there are some things that I call\r\nthe secrets of the secrets of the secrets that I dare not think of\r\nunless I am quite alone, and then I shut my eyes, and put my hands over\r\nthem and whisper the word, and the Alala comes. I only do this at night\r\nin my room or in certain woods that I know, but I must not describe\r\nthem, as they are secret woods. Then there are the Ceremonies, which are\r\nall of them important, but some are more delightful than others--there\r\nare the White Ceremonies, and the Green Ceremonies, and the Scarlet\r\nCeremonies. The Scarlet Ceremonies are the best, but there is only one\r\nplace where they can be performed properly, though there is a very nice\r\nimitation which I have done in other places. Besides these, I have the\r\ndances, and the Comedy, and I have done the Comedy sometimes when the\r\nothers were looking, and they didn't understand anything about it. I\r\nwas very little when I first knew about these things.\r\n\r\nWhen I was very small, and mother was alive, I can remember remembering\r\nthings before that, only it has all got confused. But I remember when I\r\nwas five or six I heard them talking about me when they thought I was\r\nnot noticing. They were saying how queer I was a year or two before, and\r\nhow nurse had called my mother to come and listen to me talking all to\r\nmyself, and I was saying words that nobody could understand. I was\r\nspeaking the Xu language, but I only remember a very few of the words,\r\nas it was about the little white faces that used to look at me when I\r\nwas lying in my cradle. They used to talk to me, and I learnt their\r\nlanguage and talked to them in it about some great white place where\r\nthey lived, where the trees and the grass were all white, and there were\r\nwhite hills as high up as the moon, and a cold wind. I have often\r\ndreamed of it afterwards, but the faces went away when I was very\r\nlittle. But a wonderful thing happened when I was about five. My nurse\r\nwas carrying me on her shoulder; there was a field of yellow corn, and\r\nwe went through it, it was very hot. Then we came to a path through a\r\nwood, and a tall man came after us, and went with us till we came to a\r\nplace where there was a deep pool, and it was very dark and shady. Nurse\r\nput me down on the soft moss under a tree, and she said: 'She can't get\r\nto the pond now.' So they left me there, and I sat quite still and\r\nwatched, and out of the water and out of the wood came two wonderful\r\nwhite people, and they began to play and dance and sing. They were a\r\nkind of creamy white like the old ivory figure in the drawing-room; one\r\nwas a beautiful lady with kind dark eyes, and a grave face, and long\r\nblack hair, and she smiled such a strange sad smile at the other, who\r\nlaughed and came to her. They played together, and danced round and\r\nround the pool, and they sang a song till I fell asleep. Nurse woke me\r\nup when she came back, and she was looking something like the lady had\r\nlooked, so I told her all about it, and asked her why she looked like\r\nthat. At first she cried, and then she looked very frightened, and\r\nturned quite pale. She put me down on the grass and stared at me, and I\r\ncould see she was shaking all over. Then she said I had been dreaming,\r\nbut I knew I hadn't. Then she made me promise not to say a word about it\r\nto anybody, and if I did I should be thrown into the black pit. I was\r\nnot frightened at all, though nurse was, and I never forgot about it,\r\nbecause when I shut my eyes and it was quite quiet, and I was all alone,\r\nI could see them again, very faint and far away, but very splendid; and\r\nlittle bits of the song they sang came into my head, but I couldn't sing\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI was thirteen, nearly fourteen, when I had a very singular adventure,\r\nso strange that the day on which it happened is always called the White\r\nDay. My mother had been dead for more than a year, and in the morning I\r\nhad lessons, but they let me go out for walks in the afternoon. And this\r\nafternoon I walked a new way, and a little brook led me into a new\r\ncountry, but I tore my frock getting through some of the difficult\r\nplaces, as the way was through many bushes, and beneath the low branches\r\nof trees, and up thorny thickets on the hills, and by dark woods full of\r\ncreeping thorns. And it was a long, long way. It seemed as if I was\r\ngoing on for ever and ever, and I had to creep by a place like a tunnel\r\nwhere a brook must have been, but all the water had dried up, and the\r\nfloor was rocky, and the bushes had grown overhead till they met, so\r\nthat it was quite dark. And I went on and on through that dark place; it\r\nwas a long, long way. And I came to a hill that I never saw before. I\r\nwas in a dismal thicket full of black twisted boughs that tore me as I\r\nwent through them, and I cried out because I was smarting all over, and\r\nthen I found that I was climbing, and I went up and up a long way, till\r\nat last the thicket stopped and I came out crying just under the top of\r\na big bare place, where there were ugly grey stones lying all about on\r\nthe grass, and here and there a little twisted, stunted tree came out\r\nfrom under a stone, like a snake. And I went up, right to the top, a\r\nlong way. I never saw such big ugly stones before; they came out of the\r\nearth some of them, and some looked as if they had been rolled to where\r\nthey were, and they went on and on as far as I could see, a long, long\r\nway. I looked out from them and saw the country, but it was strange. It\r\nwas winter time, and there were black terrible woods hanging from the\r\nhills all round; it was like seeing a large room hung with black\r\ncurtains, and the shape of the trees seemed quite different from any I\r\nhad ever seen before. I was afraid. Then beyond the woods there were\r\nother hills round in a great ring, but I had never seen any of them; it\r\nall looked black, and everything had a voor over it. It was all so still\r\nand silent, and the sky was heavy and grey and sad, like a wicked\r\nvoorish dome in Deep Dendo. I went on into the dreadful rocks. There\r\nwere hundreds and hundreds of them. Some were like horrid-grinning men;\r\nI could see their faces as if they would jump at me out of the stone,\r\nand catch hold of me, and drag me with them back into the rock, so that\r\nI should always be there. And there were other rocks that were like\r\nanimals, creeping, horrible animals, putting out their tongues, and\r\nothers were like words that I could not say, and others like dead people\r\nlying on the grass. I went on among them, though they frightened me, and\r\nmy heart was full of wicked songs that they put into it; and I wanted to\r\nmake faces and twist myself about in the way they did, and I went on and\r\non a long way till at last I liked the rocks, and they didn't frighten\r\nme any more. I sang the songs I thought of; songs full of words that\r\nmust not be spoken or written down. Then I made faces like the faces on\r\nthe rocks, and I twisted myself about like the twisted ones, and I lay\r\ndown flat on the ground like the dead ones, and I went up to one that\r\nwas grinning, and put my arms round him and hugged him. And so I went on\r\nand on through the rocks till I came to a round mound in the middle of\r\nthem. It was higher than a mound, it was nearly as high as our house,\r\nand it was like a great basin turned upside down, all smooth and round\r\nand green, with one stone, like a post, sticking up at the top. I\r\nclimbed up the sides, but they were so steep I had to stop or I should\r\nhave rolled all the way down again, and I should have knocked against\r\nthe stones at the bottom, and perhaps been killed. But I wanted to get\r\nup to the very top of the big round mound, so I lay down flat on my\r\nface, and took hold of the grass with my hands and drew myself up, bit\r\nby bit, till I was at the top. Then I sat down on the stone in the\r\nmiddle, and looked all round about. I felt I had come such a long, long\r\nway, just as if I were a hundred miles from home, or in some other\r\ncountry, or in one of the strange places I had read about in the 'Tales\r\nof the Genie' and the 'Arabian Nights,' or as if I had gone across the\r\nsea, far away, for years and I had found another world that nobody had\r\never seen or heard of before, or as if I had somehow flown through the\r\nsky and fallen on one of the stars I had read about where everything is\r\ndead and cold and grey, and there is no air, and the wind doesn't blow.\r\nI sat on the stone and looked all round and down and round about me. It\r\nwas just as if I was sitting on a tower in the middle of a great empty\r\ntown, because I could see nothing all around but the grey rocks on the\r\nground. I couldn't make out their shapes any more, but I could see them\r\non and on for a long way, and I looked at them, and they seemed as if\r\nthey had been arranged into patterns, and shapes, and figures. I knew\r\nthey couldn't be, because I had seen a lot of them coming right out of\r\nthe earth, joined to the deep rocks below, so I looked again, but still\r\nI saw nothing but circles, and small circles inside big ones, and\r\npyramids, and domes, and spires, and they seemed all to go round and\r\nround the place where I was sitting, and the more I looked, the more I\r\nsaw great big rings of rocks, getting bigger and bigger, and I stared so\r\nlong that it felt as if they were all moving and turning, like a great\r\nwheel, and I was turning, too, in the middle. I got quite dizzy and\r\nqueer in the head, and everything began to be hazy and not clear, and I\r\nsaw little sparks of blue light, and the stones looked as if they were\r\nspringing and dancing and twisting as they went round and round and\r\nround. I was frightened again, and I cried out loud, and jumped up from\r\nthe stone I was sitting on, and fell down. When I got up I was so glad\r\nthey all looked still, and I sat down on the top and slid down the\r\nmound, and went on again. I danced as I went in the peculiar way the\r\nrocks had danced when I got giddy, and I was so glad I could do it quite\r\nwell, and I danced and danced along, and sang extraordinary songs that\r\ncame into my head. At last I came to the edge of that great flat hill,\r\nand there were no more rocks, and the way went again through a dark\r\nthicket in a hollow. It was just as bad as the other one I went through\r\nclimbing up, but I didn't mind this one, because I was so glad I had\r\nseen those singular dances and could imitate them. I went down, creeping\r\nthrough the bushes, and a tall nettle stung me on my leg, and made me\r\nburn, but I didn't mind it, and I tingled with the boughs and the\r\nthorns, but I only laughed and sang. Then I got out of the thicket into\r\na close valley, a little secret place like a dark passage that nobody\r\never knows of, because it was so narrow and deep and the woods were so\r\nthick round it. There is a steep bank with trees hanging over it, and\r\nthere the ferns keep green all through the winter, when they are dead\r\nand brown upon the hill, and the ferns there have a sweet, rich smell\r\nlike what oozes out of fir trees. There was a little stream of water\r\nrunning down this valley, so small that I could easily step across it. I\r\ndrank the water with my hand, and it tasted like bright, yellow wine,\r\nand it sparkled and bubbled as it ran down over beautiful red and yellow\r\nand green stones, so that it seemed alive and all colours at once. I\r\ndrank it, and I drank more with my hand, but I couldn't drink enough,\r\nso I lay down and bent my head and sucked the water up with my lips. It\r\ntasted much better, drinking it that way, and a ripple would come up to\r\nmy mouth and give me a kiss, and I laughed, and drank again, and\r\npretended there was a nymph, like the one in the old picture at home,\r\nwho lived in the water and was kissing me. So I bent low down to the\r\nwater, and put my lips softly to it, and whispered to the nymph that I\r\nwould come again. I felt sure it could not be common water, I was so\r\nglad when I got up and went on; and I danced again and went up and up\r\nthe valley, under hanging hills. And when I came to the top, the ground\r\nrose up in front of me, tall and steep as a wall, and there was nothing\r\nbut the green wall and the sky. I thought of 'for ever and for ever,\r\nworld without end, Amen'; and I thought I must have really found the end\r\nof the world, because it was like the end of everything, as if there\r\ncould be nothing at all beyond, except the kingdom of Voor, where the\r\nlight goes when it is put out, and the water goes when the sun takes it\r\naway. I began to think of all the long, long way I had journeyed, how I\r\nhad found a brook and followed it, and followed it on, and gone through\r\nbushes and thorny thickets, and dark woods full of creeping thorns. Then\r\nI had crept up a tunnel under trees, and climbed a thicket, and seen all\r\nthe grey rocks, and sat in the middle of them when they turned round,\r\nand then I had gone on through the grey rocks and come down the hill\r\nthrough the stinging thicket and up the dark valley, all a long, long\r\nway. I wondered how I should get home again, if I could ever find the\r\nway, and if my home was there any more, or if it were turned and\r\neverybody in it into grey rocks, as in the 'Arabian Nights.' So I sat\r\ndown on the grass and thought what I should do next. I was tired, and my\r\nfeet were hot with walking, and as I looked about I saw there was a\r\nwonderful well just under the high, steep wall of grass. All the ground\r\nround it was covered with bright, green, dripping moss; there was every\r\nkind of moss there, moss like beautiful little ferns, and like palms and\r\nfir trees, and it was all green as jewellery, and drops of water hung on\r\nit like diamonds. And in the middle was the great well, deep and shining\r\nand beautiful, so clear that it looked as if I could touch the red sand\r\nat the bottom, but it was far below. I stood by it and looked in, as if\r\nI were looking in a glass. At the bottom of the well, in the middle of\r\nit, the red grains of sand were moving and stirring all the time, and I\r\nsaw how the water bubbled up, but at the top it was quite smooth, and\r\nfull and brimming. It was a great well, large like a bath, and with the\r\nshining, glittering green moss about it, it looked like a great white\r\njewel, with green jewels all round. My feet were so hot and tired that I\r\ntook off my boots and stockings, and let my feet down into the water,\r\nand the water was soft and cold, and when I got up I wasn't tired any\r\nmore, and I felt I must go on, farther and farther, and see what was on\r\nthe other side of the wall. I climbed up it very slowly, going sideways\r\nall the time, and when I got to the top and looked over, I was in the\r\nqueerest country I had seen, stranger even than the hill of the grey\r\nrocks. It looked as if earth-children had been playing there with their\r\nspades, as it was all hills and hollows, and castles and walls made of\r\nearth and covered with grass. There were two mounds like big beehives,\r\nround and great and solemn, and then hollow basins, and then a steep\r\nmounting wall like the ones I saw once by the seaside where the big guns\r\nand the soldiers were. I nearly fell into one of the round hollows, it\r\nwent away from under my feet so suddenly, and I ran fast down the side\r\nand stood at the bottom and looked up. It was strange and solemn to look\r\nup. There was nothing but the grey, heavy sky and the sides of the\r\nhollow; everything else had gone away, and the hollow was the whole\r\nworld, and I thought that at night it must be full of ghosts and moving\r\nshadows and pale things when the moon shone down to the bottom at the\r\ndead of the night, and the wind wailed up above. It was so strange and\r\nsolemn and lonely, like a hollow temple of dead heathen gods. It\r\nreminded me of a tale my nurse had told me when I was quite little; it\r\nwas the same nurse that took me into the wood where I saw the beautiful\r\nwhite people. And I remembered how nurse had told me the story one\r\nwinter night, when the wind was beating the trees against the wall, and\r\ncrying and moaning in the nursery chimney. She said there was, somewhere\r\nor other, a hollow pit, just like the one I was standing in, everybody\r\nwas afraid to go into it or near it, it was such a bad place. But once\r\nupon a time there was a poor girl who said she would go into the hollow\r\npit, and everybody tried to stop her, but she would go. And she went\r\ndown into the pit and came back laughing, and said there was nothing\r\nthere at all, except green grass and red stones, and white stones and\r\nyellow flowers. And soon after people saw she had most beautiful emerald\r\nearrings, and they asked how she got them, as she and her mother were\r\nquite poor. But she laughed, and said her earrings were not made of\r\nemeralds at all, but only of green grass. Then, one day, she wore on her\r\nbreast the reddest ruby that any one had ever seen, and it was as big as\r\na hen's egg, and glowed and sparkled like a hot burning coal of fire.\r\nAnd they asked how she got it, as she and her mother were quite poor.\r\nBut she laughed, and said it was not a ruby at all, but only a red\r\nstone. Then one day she wore round her neck the loveliest necklace that\r\nany one had ever seen, much finer than the queen's finest, and it was\r\nmade of great bright diamonds, hundreds of them, and they shone like all\r\nthe stars on a night in June. So they asked her how she got it, as she\r\nand her mother were quite poor. But she laughed, and said they were not\r\ndiamonds at all, but only white stones. And one day she went to the\r\nCourt, and she wore on her head a crown of pure angel-gold, so nurse\r\nsaid, and it shone like the sun, and it was much more splendid than the\r\ncrown the king was wearing himself, and in her ears she wore the\r\nemeralds, and the big ruby was the brooch on her breast, and the great\r\ndiamond necklace was sparkling on her neck. And the king and queen\r\nthought she was some great princess from a long way off, and got down\r\nfrom their thrones and went to meet her, but somebody told the king and\r\nqueen who she was, and that she was quite poor. So the king asked why\r\nshe wore a gold crown, and how she got it, as she and her mother were so\r\npoor. And she laughed, and said it wasn't a gold crown at all, but only\r\nsome yellow flowers she had put in her hair. And the king thought it was\r\nvery strange, and said she should stay at the Court, and they would see\r\nwhat would happen next. And she was so lovely that everybody said that\r\nher eyes were greener than the emeralds, that her lips were redder than\r\nthe ruby, that her skin was whiter than the diamonds, and that her hair\r\nwas brighter than the golden crown. So the king's son said he would\r\nmarry her, and the king said he might. And the bishop married them, and\r\nthere was a great supper, and afterwards the king's son went to his\r\nwife's room. But just when he had his hand on the door, he saw a tall,\r\nblack man, with a dreadful face, standing in front of the door, and a\r\nvoice said--\r\n\r\n    Venture not upon your life,\r\n    This is mine own wedded wife.\r\n\r\nThen the king's son fell down on the ground in a fit. And they came and\r\ntried to get into the room, but they couldn't, and they hacked at the\r\ndoor with hatchets, but the wood had turned hard as iron, and at last\r\neverybody ran away, they were so frightened at the screaming and\r\nlaughing and shrieking and crying that came out of the room. But next\r\nday they went in, and found there was nothing in the room but thick\r\nblack smoke, because the black man had come and taken her away. And on\r\nthe bed there were two knots of faded grass and a red stone, and some\r\nwhite stones, and some faded yellow flowers. I remembered this tale of\r\nnurse's while I was standing at the bottom of the deep hollow; it was so\r\nstrange and solitary there, and I felt afraid. I could not see any\r\nstones or flowers, but I was afraid of bringing them away without\r\nknowing, and I thought I would do a charm that came into my head to\r\nkeep the black man away. So I stood right in the very middle of the\r\nhollow, and I made sure that I had none of those things on me, and then\r\nI walked round the place, and touched my eyes, and my lips, and my hair\r\nin a peculiar manner, and whispered some queer words that nurse taught\r\nme to keep bad things away. Then I felt safe and climbed up out of the\r\nhollow, and went on through all those mounds and hollows and walls, till\r\nI came to the end, which was high above all the rest, and I could see\r\nthat all the different shapes of the earth were arranged in patterns,\r\nsomething like the grey rocks, only the pattern was different. It was\r\ngetting late, and the air was indistinct, but it looked from where I was\r\nstanding something like two great figures of people lying on the grass.\r\nAnd I went on, and at last I found a certain wood, which is too secret\r\nto be described, and nobody knows of the passage into it, which I found\r\nout in a very curious manner, by seeing some little animal run into the\r\nwood through it. So I went after the animal by a very narrow dark way,\r\nunder thorns and bushes, and it was almost dark when I came to a kind of\r\nopen place in the middle. And there I saw the most wonderful sight I\r\nhave ever seen, but it was only for a minute, as I ran away directly,\r\nand crept out of the wood by the passage I had come by, and ran and ran\r\nas fast as ever I could, because I was afraid, what I had seen was so\r\nwonderful and so strange and beautiful. But I wanted to get home and\r\nthink of it, and I did not know what might not happen if I stayed by the\r\nwood. I was hot all over and trembling, and my heart was beating, and\r\nstrange cries that I could not help came from me as I ran from the\r\nwood. I was glad that a great white moon came up from over a round hill\r\nand showed me the way, so I went back through the mounds and hollows and\r\ndown the close valley, and up through the thicket over the place of the\r\ngrey rocks, and so at last I got home again. My father was busy in his\r\nstudy, and the servants had not told about my not coming home, though\r\nthey were frightened, and wondered what they ought to do, so I told them\r\nI had lost my way, but I did not let them find out the real way I had\r\nbeen. I went to bed and lay awake all through the night, thinking of\r\nwhat I had seen. When I came out of the narrow way, and it looked all\r\nshining, though the air was dark, it seemed so certain, and all the way\r\nhome I was quite sure that I had seen it, and I wanted to be alone in my\r\nroom, and be glad over it all to myself, and shut my eyes and pretend it\r\nwas there, and do all the things I would have done if I had not been so\r\nafraid. But when I shut my eyes the sight would not come, and I began to\r\nthink about my adventures all over again, and I remembered how dusky and\r\nqueer it was at the end, and I was afraid it must be all a mistake,\r\nbecause it seemed impossible it could happen. It seemed like one of\r\nnurse's tales, which I didn't really believe in, though I was frightened\r\nat the bottom of the hollow; and the stories she told me when I was\r\nlittle came back into my head, and I wondered whether it was really\r\nthere what I thought I had seen, or whether any of her tales could have\r\nhappened a long time ago. It was so queer; I lay awake there in my room\r\nat the back of the house, and the moon was shining on the other side\r\ntowards the river, so the bright light did not fall upon the wall. And\r\nthe house was quite still. I had heard my father come upstairs, and just\r\nafter the clock struck twelve, and after the house was still and empty,\r\nas if there was nobody alive in it. And though it was all dark and\r\nindistinct in my room, a pale glimmering kind of light shone in through\r\nthe white blind, and once I got up and looked out, and there was a great\r\nblack shadow of the house covering the garden, looking like a prison\r\nwhere men are hanged; and then beyond it was all white; and the wood\r\nshone white with black gulfs between the trees. It was still and clear,\r\nand there were no clouds on the sky. I wanted to think of what I had\r\nseen but I couldn't, and I began to think of all the tales that nurse\r\nhad told me so long ago that I thought I had forgotten, but they all\r\ncame back, and mixed up with the thickets and the grey rocks and the\r\nhollows in the earth and the secret wood, till I hardly knew what was\r\nnew and what was old, or whether it was not all dreaming. And then I\r\nremembered that hot summer afternoon, so long ago, when nurse left me by\r\nmyself in the shade, and the white people came out of the water and out\r\nof the wood, and played, and danced, and sang, and I began to fancy that\r\nnurse told me about something like it before I saw them, only I couldn't\r\nrecollect exactly what she told me. Then I wondered whether she had been\r\nthe white lady, as I remembered she was just as white and beautiful, and\r\nhad the same dark eyes and black hair; and sometimes she smiled and\r\nlooked like the lady had looked, when she was telling me some of her\r\nstories, beginning with 'Once on a time,' or 'In the time of the\r\nfairies.' But I thought she couldn't be the lady, as she seemed to have\r\ngone a different way into the wood, and I didn't think the man who came\r\nafter us could be the other, or I couldn't have seen that wonderful\r\nsecret in the secret wood. I thought of the moon: but it was afterwards\r\nwhen I was in the middle of the wild land, where the earth was made into\r\nthe shape of great figures, and it was all walls, and mysterious\r\nhollows, and smooth round mounds, that I saw the great white moon come\r\nup over a round hill. I was wondering about all these things, till at\r\nlast I got quite frightened, because I was afraid something had happened\r\nto me, and I remembered nurse's tale of the poor girl who went into the\r\nhollow pit, and was carried away at last by the black man. I knew I had\r\ngone into a hollow pit too, and perhaps it was the same, and I had done\r\nsomething dreadful. So I did the charm over again, and touched my eyes\r\nand my lips and my hair in a peculiar manner, and said the old words\r\nfrom the fairy language, so that I might be sure I had not been carried\r\naway. I tried again to see the secret wood, and to creep up the passage\r\nand see what I had seen there, but somehow I couldn't, and I kept on\r\nthinking of nurse's stories. There was one I remembered about a young\r\nman who once upon a time went hunting, and all the day he and his hounds\r\nhunted everywhere, and they crossed the rivers and went into all the\r\nwoods, and went round the marshes, but they couldn't find anything at\r\nall, and they hunted all day till the sun sank down and began to set\r\nbehind the mountain. And the young man was angry because he couldn't\r\nfind anything, and he was going to turn back, when just as the sun\r\ntouched the mountain, he saw come out of a brake in front of him a\r\nbeautiful white stag. And he cheered to his hounds, but they whined and\r\nwould not follow, and he cheered to his horse, but it shivered and stood\r\nstock still, and the young man jumped off the horse and left the hounds\r\nand began to follow the white stag all alone. And soon it was quite\r\ndark, and the sky was black, without a single star shining in it, and\r\nthe stag went away into the darkness. And though the man had brought his\r\ngun with him he never shot at the stag, because he wanted to catch it,\r\nand he was afraid he would lose it in the night. But he never lost it\r\nonce, though the sky was so black and the air was so dark, and the stag\r\nwent on and on till the young man didn't know a bit where he was. And\r\nthey went through enormous woods where the air was full of whispers and\r\na pale, dead light came out from the rotten trunks that were lying on\r\nthe ground, and just as the man thought he had lost the stag, he would\r\nsee it all white and shining in front of him, and he would run fast to\r\ncatch it, but the stag always ran faster, so he did not catch it. And\r\nthey went through the enormous woods, and they swam across rivers, and\r\nthey waded through black marshes where the ground bubbled, and the air\r\nwas full of will-o'-the-wisps, and the stag fled away down into rocky\r\nnarrow valleys, where the air was like the smell of a vault, and the man\r\nwent after it. And they went over the great mountains and the man heard\r\nthe wind come down from the sky, and the stag went on and the man went\r\nafter. At last the sun rose and the young man found he was in a country\r\nthat he had never seen before; it was a beautiful valley with a bright\r\nstream running through it, and a great, big round hill in the middle.\r\nAnd the stag went down the valley, towards the hill, and it seemed to\r\nbe getting tired and went slower and slower, and though the man was\r\ntired, too, he began to run faster, and he was sure he would catch the\r\nstag at last. But just as they got to the bottom of the hill, and the\r\nman stretched out his hand to catch the stag, it vanished into the\r\nearth, and the man began to cry; he was so sorry that he had lost it\r\nafter all his long hunting. But as he was crying he saw there was a door\r\nin the hill, just in front of him, and he went in, and it was quite\r\ndark, but he went on, as he thought he would find the white stag. And\r\nall of a sudden it got light, and there was the sky, and the sun\r\nshining, and birds singing in the trees, and there was a beautiful\r\nfountain. And by the fountain a lovely lady was sitting, who was the\r\nqueen of the fairies, and she told the man that she had changed herself\r\ninto a stag to bring him there because she loved him so much. Then she\r\nbrought out a great gold cup, covered with jewels, from her fairy\r\npalace, and she offered him wine in the cup to drink. And he drank, and\r\nthe more he drank the more he longed to drink, because the wine was\r\nenchanted. So he kissed the lovely lady, and she became his wife, and he\r\nstayed all that day and all that night in the hill where she lived, and\r\nwhen he woke he found he was lying on the ground, close to where he had\r\nseen the stag first, and his horse was there and his hounds were there\r\nwaiting, and he looked up, and the sun sank behind the mountain. And he\r\nwent home and lived a long time, but he would never kiss any other lady\r\nbecause he had kissed the queen of the fairies, and he would never drink\r\ncommon wine any more, because he had drunk enchanted wine. And sometimes\r\nnurse told me tales that she had heard from her great-grandmother, who\r\nwas very old, and lived in a cottage on the mountain all alone, and most\r\nof these tales were about a hill where people used to meet at night long\r\nago, and they used to play all sorts of strange games and do queer\r\nthings that nurse told me of, but I couldn't understand, and now, she\r\nsaid, everybody but her great-grandmother had forgotten all about it,\r\nand nobody knew where the hill was, not even her great-grandmother. But\r\nshe told me one very strange story about the hill, and I trembled when I\r\nremembered it. She said that people always went there in summer, when it\r\nwas very hot, and they had to dance a good deal. It would be all dark at\r\nfirst, and there were trees there, which made it much darker, and people\r\nwould come, one by one, from all directions, by a secret path which\r\nnobody else knew, and two persons would keep the gate, and every one as\r\nthey came up had to give a very curious sign, which nurse showed me as\r\nwell as she could, but she said she couldn't show me properly. And all\r\nkinds of people would come; there would be gentle folks and village\r\nfolks, and some old people and boys and girls, and quite small children,\r\nwho sat and watched. And it would all be dark as they came in, except in\r\none corner where some one was burning something that smelt strong and\r\nsweet, and made them laugh, and there one would see a glaring of coals,\r\nand the smoke mounting up red. So they would all come in, and when the\r\nlast had come there was no door any more, so that no one else could get\r\nin, even if they knew there was anything beyond. And once a gentleman\r\nwho was a stranger and had ridden a long way, lost his path at night,\r\nand his horse took him into the very middle of the wild country, where\r\neverything was upside down, and there were dreadful marshes and great\r\nstones everywhere, and holes underfoot, and the trees looked like\r\ngibbet-posts, because they had great black arms that stretched out\r\nacross the way. And this strange gentleman was very frightened, and his\r\nhorse began to shiver all over, and at last it stopped and wouldn't go\r\nany farther, and the gentleman got down and tried to lead the horse, but\r\nit wouldn't move, and it was all covered with a sweat, like death. So\r\nthe gentleman went on all alone, going farther and farther into the wild\r\ncountry, till at last he came to a dark place, where he heard shouting\r\nand singing and crying, like nothing he had ever heard before. It all\r\nsounded quite close to him, but he couldn't get in, and so he began to\r\ncall, and while he was calling, something came behind him, and in a\r\nminute his mouth and arms and legs were all bound up, and he fell into a\r\nswoon. And when he came to himself, he was lying by the roadside, just\r\nwhere he had first lost his way, under a blasted oak with a black trunk,\r\nand his horse was tied beside him. So he rode on to the town and told\r\nthe people there what had happened, and some of them were amazed; but\r\nothers knew. So when once everybody had come, there was no door at all\r\nfor anybody else to pass in by. And when they were all inside, round in\r\na ring, touching each other, some one began to sing in the darkness, and\r\nsome one else would make a noise like thunder with a thing they had on\r\npurpose, and on still nights people would hear the thundering noise far,\r\nfar away beyond the wild land, and some of them, who thought they knew\r\nwhat it was, used to make a sign on their breasts when they woke up in\r\ntheir beds at dead of night and heard that terrible deep noise, like\r\nthunder on the mountains. And the noise and the singing would go on and\r\non for a long time, and the people who were in a ring swayed a little to\r\nand fro; and the song was in an old, old language that nobody knows now,\r\nand the tune was queer. Nurse said her great-grandmother had known some\r\none who remembered a little of it, when she was quite a little girl, and\r\nnurse tried to sing some of it to me, and it was so strange a tune that\r\nI turned all cold and my flesh crept as if I had put my hand on\r\nsomething dead. Sometimes it was a man that sang and sometimes it was a\r\nwoman, and sometimes the one who sang it did it so well that two or\r\nthree of the people who were there fell to the ground shrieking and\r\ntearing with their hands. The singing went on, and the people in the\r\nring kept swaying to and fro for a long time, and at last the moon would\r\nrise over a place they called the Tole Deol, and came up and showed them\r\nswinging and swaying from side to side, with the sweet thick smoke\r\ncurling up from the burning coals, and floating in circles all around\r\nthem. Then they had their supper. A boy and a girl brought it to them;\r\nthe boy carried a great cup of wine, and the girl carried a cake of\r\nbread, and they passed the bread and the wine round and round, but they\r\ntasted quite different from common bread and common wine, and changed\r\neverybody that tasted them. Then they all rose up and danced, and secret\r\nthings were brought out of some hiding place, and they played\r\nextraordinary games, and danced round and round and round in the\r\nmoonlight, and sometimes people would suddenly disappear and never be\r\nheard of afterwards, and nobody knew what had happened to them. And\r\nthey drank more of that curious wine, and they made images and\r\nworshipped them, and nurse showed me how the images were made one day\r\nwhen we were out for a walk, and we passed by a place where there was a\r\nlot of wet clay. So nurse asked me if I would like to know what those\r\nthings were like that they made on the hill, and I said yes. Then she\r\nasked me if I would promise never to tell a living soul a word about it,\r\nand if I did I was to be thrown into the black pit with the dead people,\r\nand I said I wouldn't tell anybody, and she said the same thing again\r\nand again, and I promised. So she took my wooden spade and dug a big\r\nlump of clay and put it in my tin bucket, and told me to say if any one\r\nmet us that I was going to make pies when I went home. Then we went on a\r\nlittle way till we came to a little brake growing right down into the\r\nroad, and nurse stopped, and looked up the road and down it, and then\r\npeeped through the hedge into the field on the other side, and then she\r\nsaid, 'Quick!' and we ran into the brake, and crept in and out among the\r\nbushes till we had gone a good way from the road. Then we sat down under\r\na bush, and I wanted so much to know what nurse was going to make with\r\nthe clay, but before she would begin she made me promise again not to\r\nsay a word about it, and she went again and peeped through the bushes on\r\nevery side, though the lane was so small and deep that hardly anybody\r\never went there. So we sat down, and nurse took the clay out of the\r\nbucket, and began to knead it with her hands, and do queer things with\r\nit, and turn it about. And she hid it under a big dock-leaf for a minute\r\nor two and then she brought it out again, and then she stood up and sat\r\ndown, and walked round the clay in a peculiar manner, and all the time\r\nshe was softly singing a sort of rhyme, and her face got very red. Then\r\nshe sat down again, and took the clay in her hands and began to shape it\r\ninto a doll, but not like the dolls I have at home, and she made the\r\nqueerest doll I had ever seen, all out of the wet clay, and hid it under\r\na bush to get dry and hard, and all the time she was making it she was\r\nsinging these rhymes to herself, and her face got redder and redder. So\r\nwe left the doll there, hidden away in the bushes where nobody would\r\never find it. And a few days later we went the same walk, and when we\r\ncame to that narrow, dark part of the lane where the brake runs down to\r\nthe bank, nurse made me promise all over again, and she looked about,\r\njust as she had done before, and we crept into the bushes till we got to\r\nthe green place where the little clay man was hidden. I remember it all\r\nso well, though I was only eight, and it is eight years ago now as I am\r\nwriting it down, but the sky was a deep violet blue, and in the middle\r\nof the brake where we were sitting there was a great elder tree covered\r\nwith blossoms, and on the other side there was a clump of meadowsweet,\r\nand when I think of that day the smell of the meadowsweet and elder\r\nblossom seems to fill the room, and if I shut my eyes I can see the\r\nglaring blue sky, with little clouds very white floating across it, and\r\nnurse who went away long ago sitting opposite me and looking like the\r\nbeautiful white lady in the wood. So we sat down and nurse took out the\r\nclay doll from the secret place where she had hidden it, and she said we\r\nmust 'pay our respects,' and she would show me what to do, and I must\r\nwatch her all the time. So she did all sorts of queer things with the\r\nlittle clay man, and I noticed she was all streaming with perspiration,\r\nthough we had walked so slowly, and then she told me to 'pay my\r\nrespects,' and I did everything she did because I liked her, and it was\r\nsuch an odd game. And she said that if one loved very much, the clay man\r\nwas very good, if one did certain things with it, and if one hated very\r\nmuch, it was just as good, only one had to do different things, and we\r\nplayed with it a long time, and pretended all sorts of things. Nurse\r\nsaid her great-grandmother had told her all about these images, but what\r\nwe did was no harm at all, only a game. But she told me a story about\r\nthese images that frightened me very much, and that was what I\r\nremembered that night when I was lying awake in my room in the pale,\r\nempty darkness, thinking of what I had seen and the secret wood. Nurse\r\nsaid there was once a young lady of the high gentry, who lived in a\r\ngreat castle. And she was so beautiful that all the gentlemen wanted to\r\nmarry her, because she was the loveliest lady that anybody had ever\r\nseen, and she was kind to everybody, and everybody thought she was very\r\ngood. But though she was polite to all the gentlemen who wished to marry\r\nher, she put them off, and said she couldn't make up her mind, and she\r\nwasn't sure she wanted to marry anybody at all. And her father, who was\r\na very great lord, was angry, though he was so fond of her, and he asked\r\nher why she wouldn't choose a bachelor out of all the handsome young men\r\nwho came to the castle. But she only said she didn't love any of them\r\nvery much, and she must wait, and if they pestered her, she said she\r\nwould go and be a nun in a nunnery. So all the gentlemen said they\r\nwould go away and wait for a year and a day, and when a year and a day\r\nwere gone, they would come back again and ask her to say which one she\r\nwould marry. So the day was appointed and they all went away; and the\r\nlady had promised that in a year and a day it would be her wedding day\r\nwith one of them. But the truth was, that she was the queen of the\r\npeople who danced on the hill on summer nights, and on the proper nights\r\nshe would lock the door of her room, and she and her maid would steal\r\nout of the castle by a secret passage that only they knew of, and go\r\naway up to the hill in the wild land. And she knew more of the secret\r\nthings than any one else, and more than any one knew before or after,\r\nbecause she would not tell anybody the most secret secrets. She knew how\r\nto do all the awful things, how to destroy young men, and how to put a\r\ncurse on people, and other things that I could not understand. And her\r\nreal name was the Lady Avelin, but the dancing people called her Cassap,\r\nwhich meant somebody very wise, in the old language. And she was whiter\r\nthan any of them and taller, and her eyes shone in the dark like burning\r\nrubies; and she could sing songs that none of the others could sing, and\r\nwhen she sang they all fell down on their faces and worshipped her. And\r\nshe could do what they called shib-show, which was a very wonderful\r\nenchantment. She would tell the great lord, her father, that she wanted\r\nto go into the woods to gather flowers, so he let her go, and she and\r\nher maid went into the woods where nobody came, and the maid would keep\r\nwatch. Then the lady would lie down under the trees and begin to sing a\r\nparticular song, and she stretched out her arms, and from every part of\r\nthe wood great serpents would come, hissing and gliding in and out among\r\nthe trees, and shooting out their forked tongues as they crawled up to\r\nthe lady. And they all came to her, and twisted round her, round her\r\nbody, and her arms, and her neck, till she was covered with writhing\r\nserpents, and there was only her head to be seen. And she whispered to\r\nthem, and she sang to them, and they writhed round and round, faster and\r\nfaster, till she told them to go. And they all went away directly, back\r\nto their holes, and on the lady's breast there would be a most curious,\r\nbeautiful stone, shaped something like an egg, and coloured dark blue\r\nand yellow, and red, and green, marked like a serpent's scales. It was\r\ncalled a glame stone, and with it one could do all sorts of wonderful\r\nthings, and nurse said her great-grandmother had seen a glame stone with\r\nher own eyes, and it was for all the world shiny and scaly like a snake.\r\nAnd the lady could do a lot of other things as well, but she was quite\r\nfixed that she would not be married. And there were a great many\r\ngentlemen who wanted to marry her, but there were five of them who were\r\nchief, and their names were Sir Simon, Sir John, Sir Oliver, Sir\r\nRichard, and Sir Rowland. All the others believed she spoke the truth,\r\nand that she would choose one of them to be her man when a year and a\r\nday was done; it was only Sir Simon, who was very crafty, who thought\r\nshe was deceiving them all, and he vowed he would watch and try if he\r\ncould find out anything. And though he was very wise he was very young,\r\nand he had a smooth, soft face like a girl's, and he pretended, as the\r\nrest did, that he would not come to the castle for a year and a day, and\r\nhe said he was going away beyond the sea to foreign parts. But he\r\nreally only went a very little way, and came back dressed like a servant\r\ngirl, and so he got a place in the castle to wash the dishes. And he\r\nwaited and watched, and he listened and said nothing, and he hid in dark\r\nplaces, and woke up at night and looked out, and he heard things and he\r\nsaw things that he thought were very strange. And he was so sly that he\r\ntold the girl that waited on the lady that he was really a young man,\r\nand that he had dressed up as a girl because he loved her so very much\r\nand wanted to be in the same house with her, and the girl was so pleased\r\nthat she told him many things, and he was more than ever certain that\r\nthe Lady Avelin was deceiving him and the others. And he was so clever,\r\nand told the servant so many lies, that one night he managed to hide in\r\nthe Lady Avelin's room behind the curtains. And he stayed quite still\r\nand never moved, and at last the lady came. And she bent down under the\r\nbed, and raised up a stone, and there was a hollow place underneath, and\r\nout of it she took a waxen image, just like the clay one that I and\r\nnurse had made in the brake. And all the time her eyes were burning like\r\nrubies. And she took the little wax doll up in her arms and held it to\r\nher breast, and she whispered and she murmured, and she took it up and\r\nshe laid it down again, and she held it high, and she held it low, and\r\nshe laid it down again. And she said, 'Happy is he that begat the\r\nbishop, that ordered the clerk, that married the man, that had the wife,\r\nthat fashioned the hive, that harboured the bee, that gathered the wax\r\nthat my own true love was made of.' And she brought out of an aumbry a\r\ngreat golden bowl, and she brought out of a closet a great jar of wine,\r\nand she poured some of the wine into the bowl, and she laid her mannikin\r\nvery gently in the wine, and washed it in the wine all over. Then she\r\nwent to a cupboard and took a small round cake and laid it on the\r\nimage's mouth, and then she bore it softly and covered it up. And Sir\r\nSimon, who was watching all the time, though he was terribly frightened,\r\nsaw the lady bend down and stretch out her arms and whisper and sing,\r\nand then Sir Simon saw beside her a handsome young man, who kissed her\r\non the lips. And they drank wine out of the golden bowl together, and\r\nthey ate the cake together. But when the sun rose there was only the\r\nlittle wax doll, and the lady hid it again under the bed in the hollow\r\nplace. So Sir Simon knew quite well what the lady was, and he waited and\r\nhe watched, till the time she had said was nearly over, and in a week\r\nthe year and a day would be done. And one night, when he was watching\r\nbehind the curtains in her room, he saw her making more wax dolls. And\r\nshe made five, and hid them away. And the next night she took one out,\r\nand held it up, and filled the golden bowl with water, and took the doll\r\nby the neck and held it under the water. Then she said--\r\n\r\n    Sir Dickon, Sir Dickon, your day is done,\r\n    You shall be drowned in the water wan.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day news came to the castle that Sir Richard had been\r\ndrowned at the ford. And at night she took another doll and tied a\r\nviolet cord round its neck and hung it up on a nail. Then she said--\r\n\r\n    Sir Rowland, your life has ended its span,\r\n    High on a tree I see you hang.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day news came to the castle that Sir Rowland had been\r\nhanged by robbers in the wood. And at night she took another doll, and\r\ndrove her bodkin right into its heart. Then she said--\r\n\r\n    Sir Noll, Sir Noll, so cease your life,\r\n    Your heart pierced with the knife.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day news came to the castle that Sir Oliver had fought in a\r\ntavern, and a stranger had stabbed him to the heart. And at night she\r\ntook another doll, and held it to a fire of charcoal till it was melted.\r\nThen she said--\r\n\r\n    Sir John, return, and turn to clay,\r\n    In fire of fever you waste away.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day news came to the castle that Sir John had died in a\r\nburning fever. So then Sir Simon went out of the castle and mounted his\r\nhorse and rode away to the bishop and told him everything. And the\r\nbishop sent his men, and they took the Lady Avelin, and everything she\r\nhad done was found out. So on the day after the year and a day, when she\r\nwas to have been married, they carried her through the town in her\r\nsmock, and they tied her to a great stake in the market-place, and\r\nburned her alive before the bishop with her wax image hung round her\r\nneck. And people said the wax man screamed in the burning of the flames.\r\nAnd I thought of this story again and again as I was lying awake in my\r\nbed, and I seemed to see the Lady Avelin in the market-place, with the\r\nyellow flames eating up her beautiful white body. And I thought of it so\r\nmuch that I seemed to get into the story myself, and I fancied I was the\r\nlady, and that they were coming to take me to be burnt with fire, with\r\nall the people in the town looking at me. And I wondered whether she\r\ncared, after all the strange things she had done, and whether it hurt\r\nvery much to be burned at the stake. I tried again and again to forget\r\nnurse's stories, and to remember the secret I had seen that afternoon,\r\nand what was in the secret wood, but I could only see the dark and a\r\nglimmering in the dark, and then it went away, and I only saw myself\r\nrunning, and then a great moon came up white over a dark round hill.\r\nThen all the old stories came back again, and the queer rhymes that\r\nnurse used to sing to me; and there was one beginning 'Halsy cumsy Helen\r\nmusty,' that she used to sing very softly when she wanted me to go to\r\nsleep. And I began to sing it to myself inside of my head, and I went to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I was very tired and sleepy, and could hardly do my\r\nlessons, and I was very glad when they were over and I had had my\r\ndinner, as I wanted to go out and be alone. It was a warm day, and I\r\nwent to a nice turfy hill by the river, and sat down on my mother's old\r\nshawl that I had brought with me on purpose. The sky was grey, like the\r\nday before, but there was a kind of white gleam behind it, and from\r\nwhere I was sitting I could look down on the town, and it was all still\r\nand quiet and white, like a picture. I remembered that it was on that\r\nhill that nurse taught me to play an old game called 'Troy Town,' in\r\nwhich one had to dance, and wind in and out on a pattern in the grass,\r\nand then when one had danced and turned long enough the other person\r\nasks you questions, and you can't help answering whether you want to or\r\nnot, and whatever you are told to do you feel you have to do it. Nurse\r\nsaid there used to be a lot of games like that that some people knew of,\r\nand there was one by which people could be turned into anything you\r\nliked, and an old man her great-grandmother had seen had known a girl\r\nwho had been turned into a large snake. And there was another very\r\nancient game of dancing and winding and turning, by which you could take\r\na person out of himself and hide him away as long as you liked, and his\r\nbody went walking about quite empty, without any sense in it. But I came\r\nto that hill because I wanted to think of what had happened the day\r\nbefore, and of the secret of the wood. From the place where I was\r\nsitting I could see beyond the town, into the opening I had found, where\r\na little brook had led me into an unknown country. And I pretended I was\r\nfollowing the brook over again, and I went all the way in my mind, and\r\nat last I found the wood, and crept into it under the bushes, and then\r\nin the dusk I saw something that made me feel as if I were filled with\r\nfire, as if I wanted to dance and sing and fly up into the air, because\r\nI was changed and wonderful. But what I saw was not changed at all, and\r\nhad not grown old, and I wondered again and again how such things could\r\nhappen, and whether nurse's stories were really true, because in the\r\ndaytime in the open air everything seemed quite different from what it\r\nwas at night, when I was frightened, and thought I was to be burned\r\nalive. I once told my father one of her little tales, which was about a\r\nghost, and asked him if it was true, and he told me it was not true at\r\nall, and that only common, ignorant people believed in such rubbish. He\r\nwas very angry with nurse for telling me the story, and scolded her,\r\nand after that I promised her I would never whisper a word of what she\r\ntold me, and if I did I should be bitten by the great black snake that\r\nlived in the pool in the wood. And all alone on the hill I wondered what\r\nwas true. I had seen something very amazing and very lovely, and I knew\r\na story, and if I had really seen it, and not made it up out of the\r\ndark, and the black bough, and the bright shining that was mounting up\r\nto the sky from over the great round hill, but had really seen it in\r\ntruth, then there were all kinds of wonderful and lovely and terrible\r\nthings to think of, so I longed and trembled, and I burned and got cold.\r\nAnd I looked down on the town, so quiet and still, like a little white\r\npicture, and I thought over and over if it could be true. I was a long\r\ntime before I could make up my mind to anything; there was such a\r\nstrange fluttering at my heart that seemed to whisper to me all the time\r\nthat I had not made it up out of my head, and yet it seemed quite\r\nimpossible, and I knew my father and everybody would say it was dreadful\r\nrubbish. I never dreamed of telling him or anybody else a word about it,\r\nbecause I knew it would be of no use, and I should only get laughed at\r\nor scolded, so for a long time I was very quiet, and went about thinking\r\nand wondering; and at night I used to dream of amazing things, and\r\nsometimes I woke up in the early morning and held out my arms with a\r\ncry. And I was frightened, too, because there were dangers, and some\r\nawful thing would happen to me, unless I took great care, if the story\r\nwere true. These old tales were always in my head, night and morning,\r\nand I went over them and told them to myself over and over again, and\r\nwent for walks in the places where nurse had told them to me; and when\r\nI sat in the nursery by the fire in the evenings I used to fancy nurse\r\nwas sitting in the other chair, and telling me some wonderful story in a\r\nlow voice, for fear anybody should be listening. But she used to like\r\nbest to tell me about things when we were right out in the country, far\r\nfrom the house, because she said she was telling me such secrets, and\r\nwalls have ears. And if it was something more than ever secret, we had\r\nto hide in brakes or woods; and I used to think it was such fun creeping\r\nalong a hedge, and going very softly, and then we would get behind the\r\nbushes or run into the wood all of a sudden, when we were sure that none\r\nwas watching us; so we knew that we had our secrets quite all to\r\nourselves, and nobody else at all knew anything about them. Now and\r\nthen, when we had hidden ourselves as I have described, she used to show\r\nme all sorts of odd things. One day, I remember, we were in a hazel\r\nbrake, overlooking the brook, and we were so snug and warm, as though it\r\nwas April; the sun was quite hot, and the leaves were just coming out.\r\nNurse said she would show me something funny that would make me laugh,\r\nand then she showed me, as she said, how one could turn a whole house\r\nupside down, without anybody being able to find out, and the pots and\r\npans would jump about, and the china would be broken, and the chairs\r\nwould tumble over of themselves. I tried it one day in the kitchen, and\r\nI found I could do it quite well, and a whole row of plates on the\r\ndresser fell off it, and cook's little work-table tilted up and turned\r\nright over 'before her eyes,' as she said, but she was so frightened and\r\nturned so white that I didn't do it again, as I liked her. And\r\nafterwards, in the hazel copse, when she had shown me how to make\r\nthings tumble about, she showed me how to make rapping noises, and I\r\nlearnt how to do that, too. Then she taught me rhymes to say on certain\r\noccasions, and peculiar marks to make on other occasions, and other\r\nthings that her great-grandmother had taught her when she was a little\r\ngirl herself. And these were all the things I was thinking about in\r\nthose days after the strange walk when I thought I had seen a great\r\nsecret, and I wished nurse were there for me to ask her about it, but\r\nshe had gone away more than two years before, and nobody seemed to know\r\nwhat had become of her, or where she had gone. But I shall always\r\nremember those days if I live to be quite old, because all the time I\r\nfelt so strange, wondering and doubting, and feeling quite sure at one\r\ntime, and making up my mind, and then I would feel quite sure that such\r\nthings couldn't happen really, and it began all over again. But I took\r\ngreat care not to do certain things that might be very dangerous. So I\r\nwaited and wondered for a long time, and though I was not sure at all, I\r\nnever dared to try to find out. But one day I became sure that all that\r\nnurse said was quite true, and I was all alone when I found it out. I\r\ntrembled all over with joy and terror, and as fast as I could I ran into\r\none of the old brakes where we used to go--it was the one by the lane,\r\nwhere nurse made the little clay man--and I ran into it, and I crept\r\ninto it; and when I came to the place where the elder was, I covered up\r\nmy face with my hands and lay down flat on the grass, and I stayed there\r\nfor two hours without moving, whispering to myself delicious, terrible\r\nthings, and saying some words over and over again. It was all true and\r\nwonderful and splendid, and when I remembered the story I knew and\r\nthought of what I had really seen, I got hot and I got cold, and the air\r\nseemed full of scent, and flowers, and singing. And first I wanted to\r\nmake a little clay man, like the one nurse had made so long ago, and I\r\nhad to invent plans and stratagems, and to look about, and to think of\r\nthings beforehand, because nobody must dream of anything that I was\r\ndoing or going to do, and I was too old to carry clay about in a tin\r\nbucket. At last I thought of a plan, and I brought the wet clay to the\r\nbrake, and did everything that nurse had done, only I made a much finer\r\nimage than the one she had made; and when it was finished I did\r\neverything that I could imagine and much more than she did, because it\r\nwas the likeness of something far better. And a few days later, when I\r\nhad done my lessons early, I went for the second time by the way of the\r\nlittle brook that had led me into a strange country. And I followed the\r\nbrook, and went through the bushes, and beneath the low branches of\r\ntrees, and up thorny thickets on the hill, and by dark woods full of\r\ncreeping thorns, a long, long way. Then I crept through the dark tunnel\r\nwhere the brook had been and the ground was stony, till at last I came\r\nto the thicket that climbed up the hill, and though the leaves were\r\ncoming out upon the trees, everything looked almost as black as it was\r\non the first day that I went there. And the thicket was just the same,\r\nand I went up slowly till I came out on the big bare hill, and began to\r\nwalk among the wonderful rocks. I saw the terrible voor again on\r\neverything, for though the sky was brighter, the ring of wild hills all\r\naround was still dark, and the hanging woods looked dark and dreadful,\r\nand the strange rocks were as grey as ever; and when I looked down on\r\nthem from the great mound, sitting on the stone, I saw all their amazing\r\ncircles and rounds within rounds, and I had to sit quite still and watch\r\nthem as they began to turn about me, and each stone danced in its place,\r\nand they seemed to go round and round in a great whirl, as if one were\r\nin the middle of all the stars and heard them rushing through the air.\r\nSo I went down among the rocks to dance with them and to sing\r\nextraordinary songs; and I went down through the other thicket, and\r\ndrank from the bright stream in the close and secret valley, putting my\r\nlips down to the bubbling water; and then I went on till I came to the\r\ndeep, brimming well among the glittering moss, and I sat down. I looked\r\nbefore me into the secret darkness of the valley, and behind me was the\r\ngreat high wall of grass, and all around me there were the hanging woods\r\nthat made the valley such a secret place. I knew there was nobody here\r\nat all besides myself, and that no one could see me. So I took off my\r\nboots and stockings, and let my feet down into the water, saying the\r\nwords that I knew. And it was not cold at all, as I expected, but warm\r\nand very pleasant, and when my feet were in it I felt as if they were in\r\nsilk, or as if the nymph were kissing them. So when I had done, I said\r\nthe other words and made the signs, and then I dried my feet with a\r\ntowel I had brought on purpose, and put on my stockings and boots. Then\r\nI climbed up the steep wall, and went into the place where there are the\r\nhollows, and the two beautiful mounds, and the round ridges of land, and\r\nall the strange shapes. I did not go down into the hollow this time,\r\nbut I turned at the end, and made out the figures quite plainly, as it\r\nwas lighter, and I had remembered the story I had quite forgotten\r\nbefore, and in the story the two figures are called Adam and Eve, and\r\nonly those who know the story understand what they mean. So I went on\r\nand on till I came to the secret wood which must not be described, and I\r\ncrept into it by the way I had found. And when I had gone about halfway\r\nI stopped, and turned round, and got ready, and I bound the handkerchief\r\ntightly round my eyes, and made quite sure that I could not see at all,\r\nnot a twig, nor the end of a leaf, nor the light of the sky, as it was\r\nan old red silk handkerchief with large yellow spots, that went round\r\ntwice and covered my eyes, so that I could see nothing. Then I began to\r\ngo on, step by step, very slowly. My heart beat faster and faster, and\r\nsomething rose in my throat that choked me and made me want to cry out,\r\nbut I shut my lips, and went on. Boughs caught in my hair as I went, and\r\ngreat thorns tore me; but I went on to the end of the path. Then I\r\nstopped, and held out my arms and bowed, and I went round the first\r\ntime, feeling with my hands, and there was nothing. I went round the\r\nsecond time, feeling with my hands, and there was nothing. Then I went\r\nround the third time, feeling with my hands, and the story was all true,\r\nand I wished that the years were gone by, and that I had not so long a\r\ntime to wait before I was happy for ever and ever.\r\n\r\nNurse must have been a prophet like those we read of in the Bible.\r\nEverything that she said began to come true, and since then other things\r\nthat she told me of have happened. That was how I came to know that her\r\nstories were true and that I had not made up the secret myself out of my\r\nown head. But there was another thing that happened that day. I went a\r\nsecond time to the secret place. It was at the deep brimming well, and\r\nwhen I was standing on the moss I bent over and looked in, and then I\r\nknew who the white lady was that I had seen come out of the water in the\r\nwood long ago when I was quite little. And I trembled all over, because\r\nthat told me other things. Then I remembered how sometime after I had\r\nseen the white people in the wood, nurse asked me more about them, and I\r\ntold her all over again, and she listened, and said nothing for a long,\r\nlong time, and at last she said, 'You will see her again.' So I\r\nunderstood what had happened and what was to happen. And I understood\r\nabout the nymphs; how I might meet them in all kinds of places, and they\r\nwould always help me, and I must always look for them, and find them in\r\nall sorts of strange shapes and appearances. And without the nymphs I\r\ncould never have found the secret, and without them none of the other\r\nthings could happen. Nurse had told me all about them long ago, but she\r\ncalled them by another name, and I did not know what she meant, or what\r\nher tales of them were about, only that they were very queer. And there\r\nwere two kinds, the bright and the dark, and both were very lovely and\r\nvery wonderful, and some people saw only one kind, and some only the\r\nother, but some saw them both. But usually the dark appeared first, and\r\nthe bright ones came afterwards, and there were extraordinary tales\r\nabout them. It was a day or two after I had come home from the secret\r\nplace that I first really knew the nymphs. Nurse had shown me how to\r\ncall them, and I had tried, but I did not know what she meant, and so I\r\nthought it was all nonsense. But I made up my mind I would try again, so\r\nI went to the wood where the pool was, where I saw the white people, and\r\nI tried again. The dark nymph, Alanna, came, and she turned the pool of\r\nwater into a pool of fire....\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILOGUE\r\n\r\n'That's a very queer story,' said Cotgrave, handing back the green book\r\nto the recluse, Ambrose. 'I see the drift of a good deal, but there are\r\nmany things that I do not grasp at all. On the last page, for example,\r\nwhat does she mean by \"nymphs\"?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I think there are references throughout the manuscript to certain\r\n\"processes\" which have been handed down by tradition from age to age.\r\nSome of these processes are just beginning to come within the purview of\r\nscience, which has arrived at them--or rather at the steps which lead to\r\nthem--by quite different paths. I have interpreted the reference to\r\n\"nymphs\" as a reference to one of these processes.'\r\n\r\n'And you believe that there are such things?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, I think so. Yes, I believe I could give you convincing evidence on\r\nthat point. I am afraid you have neglected the study of alchemy? It is a\r\npity, for the symbolism, at all events, is very beautiful, and moreover\r\nif you were acquainted with certain books on the subject, I could recall\r\nto your mind phrases which might explain a good deal in the manuscript\r\nthat you have been reading.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; but I want to know whether you seriously think that there is any\r\nfoundation of fact beneath these fancies. Is it not all a department of\r\npoetry; a curious dream with which man has indulged himself?'\r\n\r\n'I can only say that it is no doubt better for the great mass of people\r\nto dismiss it all as a dream. But if you ask my veritable belief--that\r\ngoes quite the other way. No; I should not say belief, but rather\r\nknowledge. I may tell you that I have known cases in which men have\r\nstumbled quite by accident on certain of these \"processes,\" and have\r\nbeen astonished by wholly unexpected results. In the cases I am thinking\r\nof there could have been no possibility of \"suggestion\" or sub-conscious\r\naction of any kind. One might as well suppose a schoolboy \"suggesting\"\r\nthe existence of AEschylus to himself, while he plods mechanically\r\nthrough the declensions.\r\n\r\n'But you have noticed the obscurity,' Ambrose went on, 'and in this\r\nparticular case it must have been dictated by instinct, since the writer\r\nnever thought that her manuscripts would fall into other hands. But the\r\npractice is universal, and for most excellent reasons. Powerful and\r\nsovereign medicines, which are, of necessity, virulent poisons also, are\r\nkept in a locked cabinet. The child may find the key by chance, and\r\ndrink herself dead; but in most cases the search is educational, and the\r\nphials contain precious elixirs for him who has patiently fashioned the\r\nkey for himself.'\r\n\r\n'You do not care to go into details?'\r\n\r\n'No, frankly, I do not. No, you must remain unconvinced. But you saw how\r\nthe manuscript illustrates the talk we had last week?'\r\n\r\n'Is this girl still alive?'\r\n\r\n'No. I was one of those who found her. I knew the father well; he was a\r\nlawyer, and had always left her very much to herself. He thought of\r\nnothing but deeds and leases, and the news came to him as an awful\r\nsurprise. She was missing one morning; I suppose it was about a year\r\nafter she had written what you have read. The servants were called, and\r\nthey told things, and put the only natural interpretation on them--a\r\nperfectly erroneous one.\r\n\r\n'They discovered that green book somewhere in her room, and I found her\r\nin the place that she described with so much dread, lying on the ground\r\nbefore the image.'\r\n\r\n'It was an image?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it was hidden by the thorns and the thick undergrowth that had\r\nsurrounded it. It was a wild, lonely country; but you know what it was\r\nlike by her description, though of course you will understand that the\r\ncolours have been heightened. A child's imagination always makes the\r\nheights higher and the depths deeper than they really are; and she had,\r\nunfortunately for herself, something more than imagination. One might\r\nsay, perhaps, that the picture in her mind which she succeeded in a\r\nmeasure in putting into words, was the scene as it would have appeared\r\nto an imaginative artist. But it is a strange, desolate land.'\r\n\r\n'And she was dead?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. She had poisoned herself--in time. No; there was not a word to be\r\nsaid against her in the ordinary sense. You may recollect a story I told\r\nyou the other night about a lady who saw her child's fingers crushed by\r\na window?'\r\n\r\n'And what was this statue?'\r\n\r\n'Well, it was of Roman workmanship, of a stone that with the centuries\r\nhad not blackened, but had become white and luminous. The thicket had\r\ngrown up about it and concealed it, and in the Middle Ages the followers\r\nof a very old tradition had known how to use it for their own purposes.\r\nIn fact it had been incorporated into the monstrous mythology of the\r\nSabbath. You will have noted that those to whom a sight of that shining\r\nwhiteness had been vouchsafed by chance, or rather, perhaps, by apparent\r\nchance, were required to blindfold themselves on their second approach.\r\nThat is very significant.'\r\n\r\n'And is it there still?'\r\n\r\n'I sent for tools, and we hammered it into dust and fragments.'\r\n\r\n'The persistence of tradition never surprises me,' Ambrose went on after\r\na pause. 'I could name many an English parish where such traditions as\r\nthat girl had listened to in her childhood are still existent in occult\r\nbut unabated vigour. No, for me, it is the \"story\" not the \"sequel,\"\r\nwhich is strange and awful, for I have always believed that wonder is of\r\nthe soul.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great God Pan\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE EXPERIMENT\r\n\r\n'I am glad you came, Clarke; very glad indeed. I was not sure you could\r\nspare the time.'\r\n\r\n'I was able to make arrangements for a few days; things are not very\r\nlively just now. But have you no misgivings, Raymond? Is it absolutely\r\nsafe?'\r\n\r\nThe two men were slowly pacing the terrace in front of Dr. Raymond's\r\nhouse. The sun still hung above the western mountain-line, but it shone\r\nwith a dull red glow that cast no shadows, and all the air was quiet; a\r\nsweet breath came from the great wood on the hillside above, and with\r\nit, at intervals, the soft murmuring call of the wild doves. Below, in\r\nthe long lovely valley, the river wound in and out between the lonely\r\nhills, and, as the sun hovered and vanished into the west, a faint mist,\r\npure white, began to rise from the banks. Dr. Raymond turned sharply to\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n'Safe? Of course it is. In itself the operation is a perfectly simple\r\none; any surgeon could do it.'\r\n\r\n'And there is no danger at any other stage?'\r\n\r\n'None; absolutely no physical danger whatever, I give you my word. You\r\nare always timid, Clarke, always; but you know my history. I have\r\ndevoted myself to transcendental medicine for the last twenty years. I\r\nhave heard myself called quack and charlatan and impostor, but all the\r\nwhile I knew I was on the right path. Five years ago I reached the goal,\r\nand since then every day has been a preparation for what we shall do\r\nto-night.'\r\n\r\n'I should like to believe it is all true.' Clarke knit his brows, and\r\nlooked doubtfully at Dr. Raymond. 'Are you perfectly sure, Raymond, that\r\nyour theory is not a phantasmagoria--a splendid vision, certainly, but a\r\nmere vision after all?'\r\n\r\nDr. Raymond stopped in his walk and turned sharply. He was a middle-aged\r\nman, gaunt and thin, of a pale yellow complexion, but as he answered\r\nClarke and faced him, there was a flush on his cheek.\r\n\r\n'Look about you, Clarke. You see the mountain, and hill following after\r\nhill, as wave on wave, you see the woods and orchards, the fields of\r\nripe corn, and the meadows reaching to the reed-beds by the river. You\r\nsee me standing here beside you, and hear my voice; but I tell you that\r\nall these things--yes, from that star that has just shone out in the sky\r\nto the solid ground beneath our feet--I say that all these are but\r\ndreams and shadows: the shadows that hide the real world from our eyes.\r\nThere _is_ a real world, but it is beyond this glamour and this vision,\r\nbeyond these \"chases in Arras, dreams in a career,\" beyond them all as\r\nbeyond a veil. I do not know whether any human being has ever lifted\r\nthat veil; but I do know, Clarke, that you and I shall see it lifted\r\nthis very night from before another's eyes. You may think all this\r\nstrange nonsense; it may be strange, but it is true, and the ancients\r\nknew what lifting the veil means. They called it seeing the god Pan.'\r\n\r\nClarke shivered; the white mist gathering over the river was chilly.\r\n\r\n'It is wonderful indeed,' he said. 'We are standing on the brink of a\r\nstrange world, Raymond, if what you say is true. I suppose the knife is\r\nabsolutely necessary?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; a slight lesion in the grey matter, that is all; a trifling\r\nrearrangement of certain cells, a microscopical alteration that would\r\nescape the attention of ninety-nine brain specialists out of a hundred.\r\nI don't want to bother you with \"shop,\" Clarke; I might give you a mass\r\nof technical detail which would sound very imposing, and would leave you\r\nas enlightened as you are now. But I suppose you have read, casually, in\r\nout-of-the-way corners of your paper, that immense strides have been\r\nmade recently in the physiology of the brain. I saw a paragraph the\r\nother day about Digby's theory, and Browne Faber's discoveries. Theories\r\nand discoveries! Where they are standing now, I stood fifteen years ago,\r\nand I need not tell you that I have not been standing still for the last\r\nfifteen years. It will be enough if I say that five years ago I made the\r\ndiscovery to which I alluded when I said that then I reached the goal.\r\nAfter years of labour, after years of toiling and groping in the dark,\r\nafter days and nights of disappointment and sometimes of despair, in\r\nwhich I used now and then to tremble and grow cold with the thought that\r\nperhaps there were others seeking for what I sought, at last, after so\r\nlong, a pang of sudden joy thrilled my soul, and I knew the long journey\r\nwas at an end. By what seemed then and still seems a chance, the\r\nsuggestion of a moment's idle thought followed up upon familiar lines\r\nand paths that I had tracked a hundred times already, the great truth\r\nburst upon me, and I saw, mapped out in lines of light, a whole world, a\r\nsphere unknown; continents and islands, and great oceans in which no\r\nship has sailed (to my belief) since a Man first lifted up his eyes and\r\nbeheld the sun, and the stars of heaven, and the quiet earth beneath.\r\nYou will think all this high-flown language, Clarke, but it is hard to\r\nbe literal. And yet; I do not know whether what I am hinting at cannot\r\nbe set forth in plain and homely terms. For instance, this world of ours\r\nis pretty well girded now with the telegraph wires and cables; thought,\r\nwith something less than the speed of thought, flashes from sunrise to\r\nsunset, from north to south, across the floods and the desert places.\r\nSuppose that an electrician of to-day were suddenly to perceive that he\r\nand his friends have merely been playing with pebbles and mistaking them\r\nfor the foundations of the world; suppose that such a man saw uttermost\r\nspace lie open before the current, and words of men flash forth to the\r\nsun and beyond the sun into the systems beyond, and the voices of\r\narticulate-speaking men echo in the waste void that bounds our thought.\r\nAs analogies go, that is a pretty good analogy of what I have done; you\r\ncan understand now a little of what I felt as I stood here one evening;\r\nit was a summer evening, and the valley looked much as it does now; I\r\nstood here, and saw before me the unutterable, the unthinkable gulf that\r\nyawns profound between two worlds, the world of matter and the world of\r\nspirit; I saw the great empty deep stretch dim before me, and in that\r\ninstant a bridge of light leapt from the earth to the unknown shore,\r\nand the abyss was spanned. You may look in Browne Faber's book, if you\r\nlike, and you will find that to the present day men of science are\r\nunable to account for the presence, or to specify the functions of a\r\ncertain group of nerve-cells in the brain. That group is, as it were,\r\nland to let, a mere waste place for fanciful theories. I am not in the\r\nposition of Browne Faber and the specialists, I am perfectly instructed\r\nas to the possible functions of those nerve-centers in the scheme of\r\nthings. With a touch I can bring them into play, with a touch, I say, I\r\ncan set free the current, with a touch I can complete the communication\r\nbetween this world of sense and----we shall be able to finish the\r\nsentence later on. Yes, the knife is necessary; but think what that\r\nknife will effect. It will level utterly the solid wall of sense, and\r\nprobably, for the first time since man was made, a spirit will gaze on a\r\nspirit-world. Clarke, Mary will see the god Pan!'\r\n\r\n'But you remember what you wrote to me? I thought it would be requisite\r\nthat she----'\r\n\r\nHe whispered the rest into the doctor's ear.\r\n\r\n'Not at all, not at all. That is nonsense, I assure you. Indeed, it is\r\nbetter as it is; I am quite certain of that.'\r\n\r\n'Consider the matter well, Raymond. It's a great responsibility.\r\nSomething might go wrong; you would be a miserable man for the rest of\r\nyour days.'\r\n\r\n'No, I think not, even if the worst happened. As you know, I rescued\r\nMary from the gutter, and from almost certain starvation, when she was a\r\nchild; I think her life is mine, to use as I see fit. Come, it is\r\ngetting late; we had better go in.'\r\n\r\nDr. Raymond led the way into the house, through the hall, and down a\r\nlong dark passage. He took a key from his pocket and opened a heavy\r\ndoor, and motioned Clarke into his laboratory. It had once been a\r\nbilliard-room, and was lighted by a glass dome in the centre of the\r\nceiling, whence there still shone a sad grey light on the figure of the\r\ndoctor as he lit a lamp with a heavy shade and placed it on a table in\r\nthe middle of the room.\r\n\r\nClarke looked about him. Scarcely a foot of wall remained bare; there\r\nwere shelves all around laden with bottles and phials of all shapes and\r\ncolours, and at one end stood a little Chippendale bookcase. Raymond\r\npointed to this.\r\n\r\n'You see that parchment Oswald Crollius? He was one of the first to show\r\nme the way, though I don't think he ever found it himself. That is a\r\nstrange saying of his: \"In every grain of wheat there lies hidden the\r\nsoul of a star.\"'\r\n\r\nThere was not much of furniture in the laboratory. The table in the\r\ncentre, a stone slab with a drain in one corner, the two armchairs on\r\nwhich Raymond and Clarke were sitting; that was all, except an\r\nodd-looking chair at the furthest end of the room. Clarke looked at it,\r\nand raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n'Yes, that is the chair,' said Raymond. 'We may as well place it in\r\nposition,' He got up and wheeled the chair to the light, and began\r\nraising and lowering it, letting down the seat, setting the back at\r\nvarious angles, and adjusting the foot-rest. It looked comfortable\r\nenough, and Clarke passed his hand over the soft green velvet, as the\r\ndoctor manipulated the levers.\r\n\r\n'Now, Clarke, make yourself quite comfortable. I have a couple of\r\nhours' work before me; I was obliged to leave certain matters to the\r\nlast.'\r\n\r\nRaymond went to the stone slab, and Clarke watched him drearily as he\r\nbent over a row of phials and lit the flame under the crucible. The\r\ndoctor had a small hand-lamp, shaded as the larger one, on a ledge above\r\nhis apparatus, and Clarke, who sat in the shadows, looked down the great\r\ndreary room, wondering at the bizarre effects of brilliant light and\r\nundefined darkness contrasting with one another. Soon he became\r\nconscious of an odd odour, at first the merest suggestion of odour, in\r\nthe room; and as it grew more decided he felt surprised that he was not\r\nreminded of the chemist's shop or the surgery. Clarke found himself idly\r\nendeavouring to analyse the sensation, and, half conscious, he began to\r\nthink of a day, fifteen years ago, that he had spent in roaming through\r\nthe woods and meadows near his old home. It was a burning day at the\r\nbeginning of August, the heat had dimmed the outlines of all things and\r\nall distances with a faint mist, and people who observed the thermometer\r\nspoke of an abnormal register, of a temperature that was almost\r\ntropical. Strangely that wonderful hot day of the 'fifties rose up in\r\nClarke's imagination; the sense of dazzling all-pervading sunlight\r\nseemed to blot out the shadows and the lights of the laboratory, and he\r\nfelt again the heated air beating in gusts about his face, saw the\r\nshimmer rising from the turf, and heard the myriad murmur of the summer.\r\n\r\n'I hope the smell doesn't annoy you, Clarke; there's nothing unwholesome\r\nabout it. It may make you a bit sleepy, that's all.'\r\n\r\nClarke heard the words quite distinctly, and knew that Raymond was\r\nspeaking to him, but for the life of him he could not rouse himself from\r\nhis lethargy. He could only think of the lonely walk he had taken\r\nfifteen years ago; it was his last look at the fields and woods he had\r\nknown since he was a child, and now it all stood out in brilliant light,\r\nas a picture, before him. Above all there came to his nostrils the scent\r\nof summer, the smell of flowers mingled, and the odour of the woods, of\r\ncool shaded places, deep in the green depths, drawn forth by the sun's\r\nheat; and the scent of the good earth, lying as it were with arms\r\nstretched forth, and smiling lips, overpowered all. His fancies made him\r\nwander, as he had wandered long ago, from the fields into the wood,\r\ntracking a little path between the shining undergrowth of beech-trees;\r\nand the trickle of water dropping from the limestone rock sounded as a\r\nclear melody in the dream. Thoughts began to go astray and to mingle\r\nwith other recollections; the beech alley was transformed to a path\r\nbeneath ilex-trees, and here and there a vine climbed from bough to\r\nbough, and sent up waving tendrils and drooped with purple grapes, and\r\nthe sparse grey-green leaves of a wild olive-tree stood out against the\r\ndark shadows of the ilex. Clarke, in the deep folds of dream, was\r\nconscious that the path from his father's house had led him into an\r\nundiscovered country, and he was wondering at the strangeness of it all,\r\nwhen suddenly, in place of the hum and murmur of the summer, an infinite\r\nsilence seemed to fall on all things, and the wood was hushed, and for a\r\nmoment of time he stood face to face there with a presence, that was\r\nneither man nor beast, neither the living nor the dead, but all things\r\nmingled, the form of all things but devoid of all form. And in that\r\nmoment, the sacrament of body and soul was dissolved, and a voice seemed\r\nto cry 'Let us go hence,' and then the darkness of darkness beyond the\r\nstars, the darkness of everlasting.\r\n\r\nWhen Clarke woke up with a start he saw Raymond pouring a few drops of\r\nsome oily fluid into a green phial, which he stoppered tightly.\r\n\r\n'You have been dozing,' he said; 'the journey must have tired you out.\r\nIt is done now. I am going to fetch Mary; I shall be back in ten\r\nminutes.'\r\n\r\nClarke lay back in his chair and wondered. It seemed as if he had but\r\npassed from one dream into another. He half expected to see the walls of\r\nthe laboratory melt and disappear, and to awake in London, shuddering at\r\nhis own sleeping fancies. But at last the door opened, and the doctor\r\nreturned, and behind him came a girl of about seventeen, dressed all in\r\nwhite. She was so beautiful that Clarke did not wonder at what the\r\ndoctor had written to him. She was blushing now over face and neck and\r\narms, but Raymond seemed unmoved.\r\n\r\n'Mary,' he said, 'the time has come. You are quite free. Are you willing\r\nto trust yourself to me entirely?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear.'\r\n\r\n'You hear that, Clarke? You are my witness. Here is the chair, Mary. It\r\nis quite easy. Just sit in it and lean back. Are you ready?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear, quite ready. Give me a kiss before you begin.'\r\n\r\nThe doctor stooped and kissed her mouth, kindly enough. 'Now shut your\r\neyes,' he said. The girl closed her eyelids, as if she were tired, and\r\nlonged for sleep, and Raymond held the green phial to her nostrils. Her\r\nface grew white, whiter than her dress; she struggled faintly, and then\r\nwith the feeling of submission strong within her, crossed her arms upon\r\nher breast as a little child about to say her prayers. The bright light\r\nof the lamp beat full upon her, and Clarke watched changes fleeting over\r\nthat face as the changes of the hills when the summer clouds float\r\nacross the sun. And then she lay all white and still, and the doctor\r\nturned up one of her eyelids. She was quite unconscious. Raymond pressed\r\nhard on one of the levers and the chair instantly sank back. Clarke saw\r\nhim cutting away a circle, like a tonsure, from her hair, and the lamp\r\nwas moved nearer. Raymond took a small glittering instrument from a\r\nlittle case, and Clarke turned away shuddering. When he looked again the\r\ndoctor was binding up the wound he had made.\r\n\r\n'She will awake in five minutes.' Raymond was still perfectly cool.\r\n'There is nothing more to be done; we can only wait.'\r\n\r\nThe minutes passed slowly; they could hear a slow, heavy ticking. There\r\nwas an old clock in the passage. Clarke felt sick and faint; his knees\r\nshook beneath him, he could hardly stand.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as they watched, they heard a long-drawn sigh, and suddenly\r\ndid the colour that had vanished return to the girl's cheeks, and\r\nsuddenly her eyes opened. Clarke quailed before them. They shone with an\r\nawful light, looking far away, and a great wonder fell upon her face,\r\nand her hands stretched out as if to touch what was invisible; but in an\r\ninstant the wonder faded, and gave place to the most awful terror. The\r\nmuscles of her face were hideously convulsed, she shook from head to\r\nfoot; the soul seemed struggling and shuddering within the house of\r\nflesh. It was a horrible sight, and Clarke rushed forward, as she fell\r\nshrieking to the floor.\r\n\r\nThree days later Raymond took Clarke to Mary's bedside. She was lying\r\nwide-awake, rolling her head from side to side, and grinning vacantly.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said the doctor, still quite cool, 'it is a great pity; she is a\r\nhopeless idiot. However, it could not be helped; and, after all, she has\r\nseen the Great God Pan.'\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMR. CLARKE'S MEMOIRS\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke, the gentleman chosen by Dr. Raymond to witness the strange\r\nexperiment of the god Pan, was a person in whose character caution and\r\ncuriosity were oddly mingled; in his sober moments he thought of the\r\nunusual and the eccentric with undisguised aversion, and yet, deep in\r\nhis heart, there was a wide-eyed inquisitiveness with respect to all the\r\nmore recondite and esoteric elements in the nature of men. The latter\r\ntendency had prevailed when he accepted Raymond's invitation, for though\r\nhis considered judgment had always repudiated the doctor's theories as\r\nthe wildest nonsense, yet he secretly hugged a belief in fantasy, and\r\nwould have rejoiced to see that belief confirmed. The horrors that he\r\nwitnessed in the dreary laboratory were to a certain extent salutary; he\r\nwas conscious of being involved in an affair not altogether reputable,\r\nand for many years afterwards he clung bravely to the commonplace, and\r\nrejected all occasions of occult investigation. Indeed, on some\r\nhom[oe]opathic principle, he for some time attended the seances of\r\ndistinguished mediums, hoping that the clumsy tricks of these gentlemen\r\nwould make him altogether disgusted with mysticism of every kind, but\r\nthe remedy, though caustic, was not efficacious. Clarke knew that he\r\nstill pined for the unseen, and little by little, the old passion began\r\nto reassert itself, as the face of Mary, shuddering and convulsed with\r\nan unknowable terror, faded slowly from his memory. Occupied all day in\r\npursuits both serious and lucrative, the temptation to relax in the\r\nevening was too great, especially in the winter months, when the fire\r\ncast a warm glow over his snug bachelor apartment, and a bottle of some\r\nchoice claret stood ready by his elbow. His dinner digested, he would\r\nmake a brief pretence of reading the evening paper, but the mere\r\ncatalogue of news soon palled upon him, and Clarke would find himself\r\ncasting glances of warm desire in the direction of an old Japanese\r\nbureau, which stood at a pleasant distance from the hearth. Like a boy\r\nbefore a jam-closet, for a few minutes he would hover indecisive, but\r\nlust always prevailed, and Clarke ended by drawing up his chair,\r\nlighting a candle, and sitting down before the bureau. Its pigeonholes\r\nand drawers teemed with documents on the most morbid subjects, and in\r\nthe well reposed a large manuscript volume, in which he had painfully\r\nentered the gems of his collection. Clarke had a fine contempt for\r\npublished literature; the most ghostly story ceased to interest him if\r\nit happened to be printed; his sole pleasure was in the reading,\r\ncompiling, and rearranging what he called his 'Memoirs to prove the\r\nExistence of the Devil,' and engaged in this pursuit the evening seemed\r\nto fly and the night appeared too short.\r\n\r\nOn one particular evening, an ugly December night, black with fog, and\r\nraw with frost, Clarke hurried over his dinner, and scarcely deigned to\r\nobserve his customary ritual of taking up the paper and laying it down\r\nagain. He paced two or three times up and down the room, and opened the\r\nbureau, stood still a moment, and sat down. He leant back, absorbed in\r\none of those dreams to which he was subject, and at length drew out his\r\nbook, and opened it at the last entry. There were three or four pages\r\ndensely covered with Clarke's round, set penmanship, and at the\r\nbeginning he had written in a somewhat larger hand:\r\n\r\n    Singular Narrative told me by my Friend, Dr. Phillips. He assures me\r\n    that all the facts related therein are strictly and wholly True, but\r\n    refuses to give either the Surnames of the Persons concerned, or the\r\n    Place where these Extraordinary Events occurred.\r\n\r\nMr. Clarke began to read over the account for the tenth time, glancing\r\nnow and then at the pencil notes he had made when it was told him by his\r\nfriend. It was one of his humours to pride himself on a certain literary\r\nability; he thought well of his style, and took pains in arranging the\r\ncircumstances in dramatic order. He read the following story:--\r\n\r\nThe persons concerned in this statement are Helen V., who, if she is\r\nstill alive, must now be a woman of twenty-three, Rachel M., since\r\ndeceased, who was a year younger than the above, and Trevor W., an\r\nimbecile, aged eighteen. These persons were at the period of the story\r\ninhabitants of a village on the borders of Wales, a place of some\r\nimportance in the time of the Roman occupation, but now a scattered\r\nhamlet, of not more than five hundred souls. It is situated on rising\r\nground, about six miles from the sea, and is sheltered by a large and\r\npicturesque forest.\r\n\r\nSome eleven years ago, Helen V. came to the village under rather\r\npeculiar circumstances. It is understood that she, being an orphan, was\r\nadopted in her infancy by a distant relative, who brought her up in his\r\nown house till she was twelve years old. Thinking, however, that it\r\nwould be better for the child to have playmates of her own age, he\r\nadvertised in several local papers for a good home in a comfortable\r\nfarmhouse for a girl of twelve, and this advertisement was answered by\r\nMr. R., a well-to-do farmer in the above-mentioned village. His\r\nreferences proving satisfactory, the gentleman sent his adopted daughter\r\nto Mr. R., with a letter, in which he stipulated that the girl should\r\nhave a room to herself, and stated that her guardians need be at no\r\ntrouble in the matter of education, as she was already sufficiently\r\neducated for the position in life which she would occupy. In fact, Mr.\r\nR. was given to understand that the girl was to be allowed to find her\r\nown occupations, and to spend her time almost as she liked. Mr. R. duly\r\nmet her at the nearest station, a town some seven miles away from his\r\nhouse, and seems to have remarked nothing extraordinary about the\r\nchild, except that she was reticent as to her former life and her\r\nadopted father. She was, however, of a very different type from the\r\ninhabitants of the village; her skin was a pale, clear olive, and her\r\nfeatures were strongly marked, and of a somewhat foreign character. She\r\nappears to have settled down easily enough into farmhouse life, and\r\nbecame a favourite with the children, who sometimes went with her on her\r\nrambles in the forest, for this was her amusement. Mr. R. states that he\r\nhas known her go out by herself directly after their early breakfast,\r\nand not return till after dusk, and that, feeling uneasy at a young girl\r\nbeing out alone for so many hours, he communicated with her adopted\r\nfather, who replied in a brief note that Helen must do as she chose. In\r\nthe winter, when the forest paths are impassable, she spent most of her\r\ntime in her bedroom, where she slept alone, according to the\r\ninstructions of her relative. It was on one of these expeditions to the\r\nforest that the first of the singular incidents with which this girl is\r\nconnected occurred, the date being about a year after her arrival at the\r\nvillage. The preceding winter had been remarkably severe, the snow\r\ndrifting to a great depth, and the frost continuing for an unexampled\r\nperiod, and the summer following was as noteworthy for its extreme heat.\r\nOn one of the very hottest days in this summer, Helen V. left the\r\nfarmhouse for one of her long rambles in the forest, taking with her, as\r\nusual, some bread and meat for lunch. She was seen by some men in the\r\nfields making for the old Roman Road, a green causeway which traverses\r\nthe highest part of the wood, and they were astonished to observe that\r\nthe girl had taken off her hat, though the heat of the sun was already\r\nalmost tropical. As it happened, a labourer, Joseph W. by name, was\r\nworking in the forest near the Roman Road, and at twelve o'clock his\r\nlittle son, Trevor, brought the man his dinner of bread and cheese.\r\nAfter the meal, the boy, who was about seven years old at the time, left\r\nhis father at work, and, as he said, went to look for flowers in the\r\nwood, and the man, who could hear him shouting with delight over his\r\ndiscoveries, felt no uneasiness. Suddenly, however, he was horrified at\r\nhearing the most dreadful screams, evidently the result of great terror,\r\nproceeding from the direction in which his son had gone, and he hastily\r\nthrew down his tools and ran to see what had happened. Tracing his path\r\nby the sound, he met the little boy, who was running headlong, and was\r\nevidently terribly frightened, and on questioning him the man at last\r\nelicited that after picking a posy of flowers he felt tired, and lay\r\ndown on the grass and fell asleep. He was suddenly awakened, as he\r\nstated, by a peculiar noise, a sort of singing he called it, and on\r\npeeping through the branches he saw Helen V. playing on the grass with a\r\n'strange naked man,' whom he seemed unable to describe more fully. He\r\nsaid he felt dreadfully frightened, and ran away crying for his father.\r\nJoseph W. proceeded in the direction indicated by his son, and found\r\nHelen V. sitting on the grass in the middle of a glade or open space\r\nleft by charcoal burners. He angrily charged her with frightening his\r\nlittle boy, but she entirely denied the accusation and laughed at the\r\nchild's story of a 'strange man,' to which he himself did not attach\r\nmuch credence. Joseph W. came to the conclusion that the boy had woke up\r\nwith a sudden fright, as children sometimes do, but Trevor persisted in\r\nhis story, and continued in such evident distress that at last his\r\nfather took him home, hoping that his mother would be able to soothe\r\nhim. For many weeks, however, the boy gave his parents much anxiety; he\r\nbecame nervous and strange in his manner, refusing to leave the cottage\r\nby himself, and constantly alarming the household by waking in the night\r\nwith cries of 'The man in the wood! father! father!'\r\n\r\nIn course of time, however, the impression seemed to have worn off, and\r\nabout three months later he accompanied his father to the house of a\r\ngentleman in the neighbourhood, for whom Joseph W. occasionally did\r\nwork. The man was shown into the study, and the little boy was left\r\nsitting in the hall, and a few minutes later, while the gentleman was\r\ngiving W. his instructions, they were both horrified by a piercing\r\nshriek and the sound of a fall, and rushing out they found the child\r\nlying senseless on the floor, his face contorted with terror. The doctor\r\nwas immediately summoned, and after some examination he pronounced the\r\nchild to be suffering from a kind of fit, apparently produced by a\r\nsudden shock. The boy was taken to one of the bedrooms, and after some\r\ntime recovered consciousness, but only to pass into a condition\r\ndescribed by the medical man as one of violent hysteria. The doctor\r\nexhibited a strong sedative, and in the course of two hours pronounced\r\nhim fit to walk home, but in passing through the hall the paroxysms of\r\nfright returned and with additional violence. The father perceived that\r\nthe child was pointing at some object, and heard the old cry, 'The man\r\nin the wood,' and looking in the direction indicated saw a stone head of\r\ngrotesque appearance, which had been built into the wall above one of\r\nthe doors. It seems that the owner of the house had recently made\r\nalterations in his premises, and on digging the foundation for some\r\noffices, the men had found a curious head, evidently of the Roman\r\nperiod, which had been placed in the hall in the manner described. The\r\nhead is pronounced by the most experienced archaeologists of the\r\ndistrict to be that of a faun or satyr.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Dr. Phillips tells me that he has seen the head in question, and\r\nassures me that he has never received such a vivid presentment of\r\nintense evil.\r\n\r\nFrom whatever cause arising, this second shock seemed too severe for the\r\nboy Trevor, and at the present date he suffers from a weakness of\r\nintellect, which gives but little promise of amending. The matter caused\r\na good deal of sensation at the time, and the girl Helen was closely\r\nquestioned by Mr. R., but to no purpose, she steadfastly denying that\r\nshe had frightened or in any way molested Trevor.\r\n\r\nThe second event with which this girl's name is connected took place\r\nabout six years ago, and is of a still more extraordinary character.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the summer of 1882 Helen contracted a friendship of\r\na peculiarly intimate character with Rachel M., the daughter of a\r\nprosperous farmer in the neighbourhood. This girl, who was a year\r\nyounger than Helen, was considered by most people to be the prettier of\r\nthe two, though Helen's features had to a great extent softened as she\r\nbecame older. The two girls, who were together on every available\r\nopportunity, presented a singular contrast, the one with her clear,\r\nolive skin and almost Italian appearance, and the other of the\r\nproverbial red and white of our rural districts. It must be stated that\r\nthe payments made to Mr. R. for the maintenance of Helen were known in\r\nthe village for their excessive liberality, and the impression was\r\ngeneral that she would one day inherit a large sum of money from her\r\nrelative. The parents of Rachel were therefore not averse from their\r\ndaughter's friendship with the girl, and even encouraged the intimacy,\r\nthough they now bitterly regret having done so. Helen still retained her\r\nextraordinary fondness for the forest, and on several occasions Rachel\r\naccompanied her, the two friends setting out early in the morning, and\r\nremaining in the wood till dusk. Once or twice after these excursions\r\nMrs. M. thought her daughter's manner rather peculiar; she seemed\r\nlanguid and dreamy, and as it has been expressed, 'different from\r\nherself,' but these peculiarities seem to have been thought too trifling\r\nfor remark. One evening, however, after Rachel had come home, her mother\r\nheard a noise which sounded like suppressed weeping in the girl's room,\r\nand on going in found her lying, half undressed, upon the bed, evidently\r\nin the greatest distress. As soon as she saw her mother, she exclaimed,\r\n'Ah, mother, mother, why did you let me go to the forest with Helen?'\r\nMrs. M. was astonished at so strange a question, and proceeded to make\r\ninquiries. Rachel told her a wild story. She said--\r\n\r\nClarke closed the book with a snap, and turned his chair towards the\r\nfire. When his friend sat one evening in that very chair, and told his\r\nstory, Clarke had interrupted him at a point a little subsequent to\r\nthis, had cut short his words in a paroxysm of horror. 'My God!' he had\r\nexclaimed, 'think, think what you are saying. It is too incredible, too\r\nmonstrous; such things can never be in this quiet world, where men and\r\nwomen live and die, and struggle, and conquer, or maybe fail, and fall\r\ndown under sorrow, and grieve and suffer strange fortunes for many a\r\nyear; but not this, Phillips, not such things as this. There must be\r\nsome explanation, some way out of the terror. Why, man, if such a case\r\nwere possible, our earth would be a nightmare.'\r\n\r\nBut Phillips had told his story to the end, concluding:\r\n\r\n'Her flight remains a mystery to this day; she vanished in broad\r\nsunlight; they saw her walking in a meadow, and a few moments later she\r\nwas not there.'\r\n\r\nClarke tried to conceive the thing again, as he sat by the fire, and\r\nagain his mind shuddered and shrank back, appalled before the sight of\r\nsuch awful, unspeakable elements enthroned as it were, and triumphant in\r\nhuman flesh. Before him stretched the long dim vista of the green\r\ncauseway in the forest, as his friend had described it; he saw the\r\nswaying leaves and the quivering shadows on the grass, he saw the\r\nsunlight and the flowers, and far away, far in the long distance, the\r\ntwo figures moved toward him. One was Rachel, but the other?\r\n\r\nClarke had tried his best to disbelieve it all, but at the end of the\r\naccount, as he had written it in his book, he had placed the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n    ET DIABOLUS INCARNATUS EST. ET HOMO FACTUS EST.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE CITY OF RESURRECTIONS\r\n\r\n'Herbert! Good God! Is it possible?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, my name's Herbert. I think I know your face too, but I don't\r\nremember your name. My memory is very queer.'\r\n\r\n'Don't you recollect Villiers of Wadham?'\r\n\r\n'So it is, so it is. I beg your pardon, Villiers, I didn't think I was\r\nbegging of an old college friend. Good-night.'\r\n\r\n'My dear fellow, this haste is unnecessary. My rooms are close by, but\r\nwe won't go there just yet. Suppose we walk up Shaftesbury Avenue a\r\nlittle way? But how in heaven's name have you come to this pass,\r\nHerbert?'\r\n\r\n'It's a long story, Villiers, and a strange one too, but you can hear it\r\nif you like.'\r\n\r\n'Come on, then. Take my arm, you don't seem very strong.'\r\n\r\nThe ill-assorted pair moved slowly up Rupert Street; the one in dirty,\r\nevil-looking rags, and the other attired in the regulation uniform of a\r\nman about town, trim, glossy, and eminently well-to-do. Villiers had\r\nemerged from his restaurant after an excellent dinner of many courses,\r\nassisted by an ingratiating little flask of Chianti, and, in that frame\r\nof mind which was with him almost chronic, had delayed a moment by the\r\ndoor, peering round in the dimly-lighted street in search of those\r\nmysterious incidents and persons with which the streets of London teem\r\nin every quarter and at every hour. Villiers prided himself as a\r\npractised explorer of such obscure mazes and byways of London life, and\r\nin this unprofitable pursuit he displayed an assiduity which was worthy\r\nof more serious employment. Thus he stood beside the lamp-post surveying\r\nthe passers-by with undisguised curiosity, and with that gravity only\r\nknown to the systematic diner, had just enunciated in his mind the\r\nformula: 'London has been called the city of encounters; it is more than\r\nthat, it is the city of Resurrections,' when these reflections were\r\nsuddenly interrupted by a piteous whine at his elbow, and a deplorable\r\nappeal for alms. He looked around in some irritation, and with a sudden\r\nshock found himself confronted with the embodied proof of his somewhat\r\nstilted fancies. There, close beside him, his face altered and\r\ndisfigured by poverty and disgrace, his body barely covered by greasy\r\nill-fitting rags, stood his old friend Charles Herbert, who had\r\nmatriculated on the same day as himself, with whom he had been merry and\r\nwise for twelve revolving terms. Different occupations and varying\r\ninterests had interrupted the friendship, and it was six years since\r\nVilliers had seen Herbert; and now he looked upon this wreck of a man\r\nwith grief and dismay, mingled with a certain inquisitiveness as to what\r\ndreary chain of circumstance had dragged him down to such a doleful\r\npass. Villiers felt together with compassion all the relish of the\r\namateur in mysteries, and congratulated himself on his leisurely\r\nspeculations outside the restaurant.\r\n\r\nThey walked on in silence for some time, and more than one passer-by\r\nstared in astonishment at the unaccustomed spectacle of a well-dressed\r\nman with an unmistakable beggar hanging on to his arm, and, observing\r\nthis, Villiers led the way to an obscure street in Soho. Here he\r\nrepeated his question.\r\n\r\n'How on earth has it happened, Herbert? I always understood you would\r\nsucceed to an excellent position in Dorsetshire. Did your father\r\ndisinherit you? Surely not?'\r\n\r\n'No, Villiers; I came into all the property at my poor father's death;\r\nhe died a year after I left Oxford. He was a very good father to me, and\r\nI mourned his death sincerely enough. But you know what young men are; a\r\nfew months later I came up to town and went a good deal into society. Of\r\ncourse I had excellent introductions, and I managed to enjoy myself very\r\nmuch in a harmless sort of way. I played a little, certainly, but never\r\nfor heavy stakes, and the few bets I made on races brought me in\r\nmoney--only a few pounds, you know, but enough to pay for cigars and\r\nsuch petty pleasures. It was in my second season that the tide turned.\r\nOf course you have heard of my marriage?'\r\n\r\n'No, I never heard anything about it.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I married, Villiers. I met a girl, a girl of the most wonderful\r\nand most strange beauty, at the house of some people whom I knew. I\r\ncannot tell you her age; I never knew it, but, so far as I can guess, I\r\nshould think she must have been about nineteen when I made her\r\nacquaintance. My friends had come to know her at Florence; she told\r\nthem she was an orphan, the child of an English father and an Italian\r\nmother, and she charmed them as she charmed me. The first time I saw her\r\nwas at an evening party. I was standing by the door talking to a friend,\r\nwhen suddenly above the hum and babble of conversation I heard a voice\r\nwhich seemed to thrill to my heart. She was singing an Italian song. I\r\nwas introduced to her that evening, and in three months I married Helen.\r\nVilliers, that woman, if I can call her woman, corrupted my soul. The\r\nnight of the wedding I found myself sitting in her bedroom in the hotel,\r\nlistening to her talk. She was sitting up in bed, and I listened to her\r\nas she spoke in her beautiful voice, spoke of things which even now I\r\nwould not dare whisper in blackest night, though I stood in the midst of\r\na wilderness. You, Villiers, you may think you know life, and London,\r\nand what goes on day and night in this dreadful city; for all I can say\r\nyou may have heard the talk of the vilest, but I tell you you can have\r\nno conception of what I know, not in your most fantastic, hideous dreams\r\ncan you have imaged forth the faintest shadow of what I have heard--and\r\nseen. Yes, seen. I have seen the incredible, such horrors that even I\r\nmyself sometimes stop in the middle of the street, and ask whether it is\r\npossible for a man to behold such things and live. In a year, Villiers,\r\nI was a ruined man, in body and soul--in body and soul.'\r\n\r\n'But your property, Herbert? You had land in Dorset.'\r\n\r\n'I sold it all; the fields and woods, the dear old house--everything.'\r\n\r\n'And the money?'\r\n\r\n'She took it all from me.'\r\n\r\n'And then left you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; she disappeared one night. I don't know where she went, but I am\r\nsure if I saw her again it would kill me. The rest of my story is of no\r\ninterest; sordid misery, that is all. You may think, Villiers, that I\r\nhave exaggerated and talked for effect; but I have not told you half. I\r\ncould tell you certain things which would convince you, but you would\r\nnever know a happy day again. You would pass the rest of your life, as I\r\npass mine, a haunted man, a man who has seen hell.'\r\n\r\nVilliers took the unfortunate man to his rooms, and gave him a meal.\r\nHerbert could eat little, and scarcely touched the glass of wine set\r\nbefore him. He sat moody and silent by the fire, and seemed relieved\r\nwhen Villiers sent him away with a small present of money.\r\n\r\n'By the way, Herbert,' said Villiers, as they parted at the door, 'what\r\nwas your wife's name? You said Helen, I think? Helen what?'\r\n\r\n'The name she passed under when I met her was Helen Vaughan, but what\r\nher real name was I can't say. I don't think she had a name. No, no, not\r\nin that sense. Only human beings have names, Villiers; I can't say any\r\nmore. Good-bye; yes, I will not fail to call if I see any way in which\r\nyou can help me. Good-night.'\r\n\r\nThe man went out into the bitter night, and Villiers returned to his\r\nfireside. There was something about Herbert which shocked him\r\ninexpressibly; not his poor rags nor the marks which poverty had set\r\nupon his face, but rather an indefinite terror which hung about him\r\nlike a mist. He had acknowledged that he himself was not devoid of\r\nblame; the woman, he had avowed, had corrupted him body and soul, and\r\nVilliers felt that this man, once his friend, had been an actor in\r\nscenes evil beyond the power of words. His story needed no confirmation:\r\nhe himself was the embodied proof of it. Villiers mused curiously over\r\nthe story he had heard, and wondered whether he had heard both the first\r\nand the last of it. 'No,' he thought, 'certainly not the last, probably\r\nonly the beginning. A case like this is like a nest of Chinese boxes;\r\nyou open one after another and find a quainter workmanship in every box.\r\nMost likely poor Herbert is merely one of the outside boxes; there are\r\nstranger ones to follow.'\r\n\r\nVilliers could not take his mind away from Herbert and his story, which\r\nseemed to grow wilder as the night wore on. The fire began to burn low,\r\nand the chilly air of the morning crept into the room; Villiers got up\r\nwith a glance over his shoulder, and shivering slightly, went to bed.\r\n\r\nA few days later he saw at his club a gentleman of his acquaintance,\r\nnamed Austin, who was famous for his intimate knowledge of London life,\r\nboth in its tenebrous and luminous phases. Villiers, still full of his\r\nencounter in Soho and its consequences, thought Austin might possibly be\r\nable to shed some light on Herbert's history, and so after some casual\r\ntalk he suddenly put the question:\r\n\r\n'Do you happen to know anything of a man named Herbert--Charles\r\nHerbert?'\r\n\r\nAustin turned round sharply and stared at Villiers with some\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n'Charles Herbert? Weren't you in town three years ago? No; then you have\r\nnot heard of the Paul Street case? It caused a good deal of sensation at\r\nthe time.'\r\n\r\n'What was the case?'\r\n\r\n'Well, a gentleman, a man of very good position, was found dead, stark\r\ndead, in the area of a certain house in Paul Street, off Tottenham Court\r\nRoad. Of course the police did not make the discovery; if you happen to\r\nbe sitting up all night and have a light in your window, the constable\r\nwill ring the bell, but if you happen to be lying dead in somebody's\r\narea, you will be left alone. In this instance as in many others the\r\nalarm was raised by some kind of vagabond; I don't mean a common tramp,\r\nor a public-house loafer, but a gentleman, whose business or pleasure,\r\nor both, made him a spectator of the London streets at five o'clock in\r\nthe morning. This individual was, as he said, \"going home,\" it did not\r\nappear whence or whither, and had occasion to pass through Paul Street\r\nbetween four and five a. m. Something or other caught his eye at Number\r\n20; he said, absurdly enough, that the house had the most unpleasant\r\nphysiognomy he had ever observed, but, at any rate, he glanced down the\r\narea, and was a good deal astonished to see a man lying on the stones,\r\nhis limbs all huddled together, and his face turned up. Our gentleman\r\nthought his face looked peculiarly ghastly, and so set off at a run in\r\nsearch of the nearest policeman. The constable was at first inclined to\r\ntreat the matter lightly, suspecting common drunkenness; however, he\r\ncame, and after looking at the man's face, changed his tone, quickly\r\nenough. The early bird, who had picked up this fine worm, was sent off\r\nfor a doctor, and the policeman rang and knocked at the door till a\r\nslatternly servant girl came down looking more than half asleep. The\r\nconstable pointed out the contents of the area to the maid, who screamed\r\nloudly enough to wake up the street, but she knew nothing of the man;\r\nhad never seen him at the house, and so forth. Meanwhile the original\r\ndiscoverer had come back with a medical man, and the next thing was to\r\nget into the area. The gate was open, so the whole quartet stumped down\r\nthe steps. The doctor hardly needed a moment's examination; he said the\r\npoor fellow had been dead for several hours, and it was then the case\r\nbegan to get interesting. The dead man had not been robbed, and in one\r\nof his pockets were papers identifying him as--well, as a man of good\r\nfamily and means, a favourite in society, and nobody's enemy, so far as\r\ncould be known. I don't give his name, Villiers, because it has nothing\r\nto do with the story, and because it's no good raking up these affairs\r\nabout the dead when there are no relations living. The next curious\r\npoint was that the medical men couldn't agree as to how he met his\r\ndeath. There were some slight bruises on his shoulders, but they were so\r\nslight that it looked as if he had been pushed roughly out of the\r\nkitchen door, and not thrown over the railings from the street or even\r\ndragged down the steps. But there were positively no other marks of\r\nviolence about him, certainly none that would account for his death; and\r\nwhen they came to the autopsy there wasn't a trace of poison of any\r\nkind. Of course the police wanted to know all about the people at Number\r\n20, and here again, so I have heard from private sources, one or two\r\nother very curious points came out. It appears that the occupants of the\r\nhouse were a Mr. and Mrs. Charles Herbert; he was said to be a landed\r\nproprietor, though it struck most people that Paul Street was not\r\nexactly the place to look for county gentry. As for Mrs. Herbert, nobody\r\nseemed to know who or what she was, and, between ourselves, I fancy the\r\ndivers after her history found themselves in rather strange waters. Of\r\ncourse they both denied knowing anything about the deceased, and in\r\ndefault of any evidence against them they were discharged. But some very\r\nodd things came out about them. Though it was between five and six in\r\nthe morning when the dead man was removed, a large crowd had collected,\r\nand several of the neighbours ran to see what was going on. They were\r\npretty free with their comments, by all accounts, and from these it\r\nappeared that Number 20 was in very bad odour in Paul Street. The\r\ndetectives tried to trace down these rumours to some solid foundation of\r\nfact, but could not get hold of anything. People shook their heads and\r\nraised their eyebrows and thought the Herberts rather \"queer,\" \"would\r\nrather not be seen going into their house,\" and so on, but there was\r\nnothing tangible. The authorities were morally certain that the man met\r\nhis death in some way or another in the house and was thrown out by the\r\nkitchen door, but they couldn't prove it, and the absence of any\r\nindications of violence or poisoning left them helpless. An odd case,\r\nwasn't it? But curiously enough, there's something more that I haven't\r\ntold you. I happened to know one of the doctors who was consulted as to\r\nthe cause of death, and some time after the inquest I met him, and asked\r\nhim about it. \"Do you really mean to tell me,\" I said, \"that you were\r\nbaffled by the case, that you actually don't know what the man died of?\"\r\n\"Pardon me,\" he replied, \"I know perfectly well what caused death. Blank\r\ndied of fright, of sheer, awful terror; I never saw features so\r\nhideously contorted in the entire course of my practice, and I have seen\r\nthe faces of a whole host of dead.\" The doctor was usually a cool\r\ncustomer enough, and a certain vehemence in his manner struck me, but I\r\ncouldn't get anything more out of him. I suppose the Treasury didn't see\r\ntheir way to prosecuting the Herberts for frightening a man to death; at\r\nany rate, nothing was done, and the case dropped out of men's minds. Do\r\nyou happen to know anything of Herbert?'\r\n\r\n'Well,' replied Villiers, 'he was an old college friend of mine.'\r\n\r\n'You don't say so? Have you ever seen his wife?'\r\n\r\n'No, I haven't. I have lost sight of Herbert for many years.'\r\n\r\n'It's queer, isn't it, parting with a man at the college gate or at\r\nPaddington, seeing nothing of him for years, and then finding him pop up\r\nhis head in such an odd place. But I should like to have seen Mrs.\r\nHerbert; people said extraordinary things about her.'\r\n\r\n'What sort of things?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I hardly know how to tell you. Every one who saw her at the\r\npolice court said she was at once the most beautiful woman and the most\r\nrepulsive they had ever set eyes on. I have spoken to a man who saw her,\r\nand I assure you he positively shuddered as he tried to describe the\r\nwoman, but he couldn't tell why. She seems to have been a sort of\r\nenigma; and I expect if that one dead man could have told tales, he\r\nwould have told some uncommonly queer ones. And there you are again in\r\nanother puzzle; what could a respectable country gentleman like Mr.\r\nBlank (we'll call him that if you don't mind) want in such a very queer\r\nhouse as Number 20? It's altogether a very odd case, isn't it?'\r\n\r\n'It is indeed, Austin; an extraordinary case. I didn't think, when I\r\nasked you about my old friend, I should strike on such strange metal.\r\nWell, I must be off; good-day.'\r\n\r\nVilliers went away, thinking of his own conceit of the Chinese boxes;\r\nhere was quaint workmanship indeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY IN PAUL STREET\r\n\r\nA few months after Villiers's meeting with Herbert, Mr. Clarke was\r\nsitting, as usual, by his after-dinner hearth, resolutely guarding his\r\nfancies from wandering in the direction of the bureau. For more than a\r\nweek he had succeeded in keeping away from the 'Memoirs,' and he\r\ncherished hopes of a complete self-reformation; but, in spite of his\r\nendeavours, he could not hush the wonder and the strange curiosity that\r\nthat last case he had written down had excited within him. He had put\r\nthe case, or rather the outline of it, conjecturally to a scientific\r\nfriend, who shook his head, and thought Clarke getting queer, and on\r\nthis particular evening Clarke was making an effort to rationalize the\r\nstory, when a sudden knock at his door roused him from his meditations.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Villiers to see you, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Dear me, Villiers, it is very kind of you to look me up; I have not\r\nseen you for many months; I should think nearly a year. Come in, come\r\nin. And how are you, Villiers? Want any advice about investments?'\r\n\r\n'No, thanks, I fancy everything I have in that way is pretty safe. No,\r\nClarke, I have really come to consult you about a rather curious matter\r\nthat has been brought under my notice of late. I am afraid you will\r\nthink it all rather absurd when I tell my tale. I sometimes think so\r\nmyself, and that's just why I made up my mind to come to you, as I know\r\nyou're a practical man.'\r\n\r\nMr. Villiers was ignorant of the 'Memoirs to prove the Existence of the\r\nDevil.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Villiers, I shall be happy to give you my advice, to the best of\r\nmy ability. What is the nature of the case?'\r\n\r\n'It's an extraordinary thing altogether. You know my ways; I always keep\r\nmy eyes open in the streets, and in my time I have chanced upon some\r\nqueer customers, and queer cases too, but this, I think, beats all. I\r\nwas coming out of a restaurant one nasty winter night about three months\r\nago; I had had a capital dinner and a good bottle of Chianti, and I\r\nstood for a moment on the pavement, thinking what a mystery there is\r\nabout London streets and the companies that pass along them. A bottle of\r\nred wine encourages these fancies, Clarke, and I dare say I should have\r\nthought a page of small type, but I was cut short by a beggar who had\r\ncome behind me, and was making the usual appeals. Of course I looked\r\nround, and this beggar turned out to be what was left of an old friend\r\nof mine, a man named Herbert. I asked him how he had come to such a\r\nwretched pass, and he told me. We walked up and down one of those long\r\ndark Soho streets, and there I listened to his story. He said he had\r\nmarried a beautiful girl, some years younger than himself, and, as he\r\nput it, she had corrupted him body and soul. He wouldn't go into\r\ndetails; he said he dare not, that what he had seen and heard haunted\r\nhim by night and day, and when I looked in his face I knew he was\r\nspeaking the truth. There was something about the man that made me\r\nshiver. I don't know why, but it was there. I gave him a little money\r\nand sent him away, and I assure you that when he was gone I gasped for\r\nbreath. His presence seemed to chill one's blood.'\r\n\r\n'Isn't all this just a little fanciful, Villiers? I suppose the poor\r\nfellow had made an imprudent marriage, and, in plain English, gone to\r\nthe bad.'\r\n\r\n'Well, listen to this.' Villiers told Clarke the story he had heard from\r\nAustin.\r\n\r\n'You see,' he concluded, 'there can be but little doubt that this Mr.\r\nBlank, whoever he was, died of sheer terror; he saw something so awful,\r\nso terrible, that it cut short his life. And what he saw, he most\r\ncertainly saw in that house, which, somehow or other, had got a bad name\r\nin the neighbourhood. I had the curiosity to go and look at the place\r\nfor myself. It's a saddening kind of street; the houses are old enough\r\nto be mean and dreary, but not old enough to be quaint. As far as I\r\ncould see most of them are let in lodgings, furnished and unfurnished,\r\nand almost every door has three bells to it. Here and there the ground\r\nfloors have been made into shops of the commonest kind; it's a dismal\r\nstreet in every way. I found Number 20 was to let, and I went to the\r\nagent's and got the key. Of course I should have heard nothing of the\r\nHerberts in that quarter, but I asked the man, fair and square, how long\r\nthey had left the house, and whether there had been other tenants in the\r\nmeanwhile. He looked at me queerly for a minute, and told me the\r\nHerberts had left immediately after the unpleasantness, as he called it,\r\nand since then the house had been empty.'\r\n\r\nMr. Villiers paused for a moment.\r\n\r\n'I have always been rather fond of going over empty houses; there's a\r\nsort of fascination about the desolate empty rooms, with the nails\r\nsticking in the walls, and the dust thick upon the window-sills. But I\r\ndidn't enjoy going over Number 20, Paul Street. I had hardly put my foot\r\ninside the passage before I noticed a queer, heavy feeling about the air\r\nof the house. Of course all empty houses are stuffy, and so forth, but\r\nthis was something quite different; I can't describe it to you, but it\r\nseemed to stop the breath. I went into the front room and the back room,\r\nand the kitchens downstairs; they were all dirty and dusty enough, as\r\nyou would expect, but there was something strange about them all. I\r\ncouldn't define it to you, I only know I felt queer. It was one of the\r\nrooms on the first floor, though, that was the worst. It was a largish\r\nroom, and once on a time the paper must have been cheerful enough, but\r\nwhen I saw it, paint, paper, and everything were most doleful. But the\r\nroom was full of horror; I felt my teeth grinding as I put my hand on\r\nthe door, and when I went in, I thought I should have fallen fainting to\r\nthe floor. However, I pulled myself together, and stood against the end\r\nwall, wondering what on earth there could be about the room to make my\r\nlimbs tremble, and my heart beat as if I were at the hour of death. In\r\none corner there was a pile of newspapers littered about on the floor,\r\nand I began looking at them; they were papers of three or four years\r\nago, some of them half torn, and some crumpled as if they had been used\r\nfor packing. I turned the whole pile over, and amongst them I found a\r\ncurious drawing; I will show it you presently. But I couldn't stay in\r\nthe room; I felt it was overpowering me. I was thankful to come out,\r\nsafe and sound, into the open air. People stared at me as I walked along\r\nthe street, and one man said I was drunk. I was staggering about from\r\none side of the pavement to the other, and it was as much as I could do\r\nto take the key back to the agent and get home. I was in bed for a week,\r\nsuffering from what my doctor called nervous shock and exhaustion. One\r\nof those days I was reading the evening paper, and happened to notice a\r\nparagraph headed: \"Starved to Death.\" It was the usual style of thing; a\r\nmodel lodging-house in Marylebone, a door locked for several days, and a\r\ndead man in his chair when they broke in. \"The deceased,\" said the\r\nparagraph, \"was known as Charles Herbert, and is believed to have been\r\nonce a prosperous country gentleman. His name was familiar to the public\r\nthree years ago in connection with the mysterious death in Paul Street,\r\nTottenham Court Road, the deceased being the tenant of the house Number\r\n20, in the area of which a gentleman of good position was found dead\r\nunder circumstances not devoid of suspicion.\" A tragic ending, wasn't\r\nit? But after all, if what he told me were true, which I am sure it\r\nwas, the man's life was all a tragedy, and a tragedy of a stranger sort\r\nthan they put on the boards.'\r\n\r\n'And that is the story, is it?' said Clarke musingly.\r\n\r\n'Yes, that is the story.'\r\n\r\n'Well, really, Villiers, I scarcely know what to say about it. There\r\nare, no doubt, circumstances in the case which seem peculiar, the\r\nfinding of the dead man in the area of Herbert's house, for instance,\r\nand the extraordinary opinion of the physician as to the cause of death;\r\nbut, after all, it is conceivable that the facts may be explained in a\r\nstraightforward manner. As to your own sensations, when you went to see\r\nthe house, I would suggest that they were due to a vivid imagination;\r\nyou must have been brooding, in a semiconscious way, over what you had\r\nheard. I don't exactly see what more can be said or done in the matter;\r\nyou evidently think there is a mystery of some kind, but Herbert is\r\ndead; where then do you propose to look?'\r\n\r\n'I propose to look for the woman; the woman whom he married. _She_ is\r\nthe mystery.'\r\n\r\nThe two men sat silent by the fireside; Clarke secretly congratulating\r\nhimself on having successfully kept up the character of advocate of the\r\ncommonplace, and Villiers wrapt in his gloomy fancies.\r\n\r\n'I think I will have a cigarette,' he said at last, and put his hand in\r\nhis pocket to feel for the cigarette-case.\r\n\r\n'Ah!' he said, starting slightly, 'I forgot I had something to show you.\r\nYou remember my saying that I had found a rather curious sketch amongst\r\nthe pile of old newspapers at the house in Paul Street? Here it is.'\r\n\r\nVilliers drew out a small thin parcel from his pocket. It was covered\r\nwith brown paper, and secured with string, and the knots were\r\ntroublesome. In spite of himself Clarke felt inquisitive; he bent\r\nforward on his chair as Villiers painfully undid the string, and\r\nunfolded the outer covering. Inside was a second wrapping of tissue, and\r\nVilliers took it off and handed the small piece of paper to Clarke\r\nwithout a word.\r\n\r\nThere was dead silence in the room for five minutes or more; the two men\r\nsat so still that they could hear the ticking of the tall old-fashioned\r\nclock that stood outside in the hall, and in the mind of one of them the\r\nslow monotony of sound woke up a far, far memory. He was looking\r\nintently at the small pen-and-ink sketch of the woman's head; it had\r\nevidently been drawn with great care, and by a true artist, for the\r\nwoman's soul looked out of the eyes, and the lips were parted with a\r\nstrange smile. Clarke gazed still at the face; it brought to his memory\r\none summer evening long ago; he saw again the long lovely valley, the\r\nriver winding between the hills, the meadows and the cornfields, the\r\ndull red sun, and the cold white mist rising from the water. He heard a\r\nvoice speaking to him across the waves of many years, and saying,\r\n'Clarke, Mary will see the God Pan!' and then he was standing in the\r\ngrim room beside the doctor, listening to the heavy ticking of the\r\nclock, waiting and watching, watching the figure lying on the green\r\nchair beneath the lamplight. Mary rose up, and he looked into her eyes,\r\nand his heart grew cold within him.\r\n\r\n'Who is this woman?' he said at last. His voice was dry and hoarse.\r\n\r\n'That is the woman whom Herbert married.'\r\n\r\nClarke looked again at the sketch; it was not Mary after all. There\r\ncertainly was Mary's face, but there was something else, something he\r\nhad not seen on Mary's features when the white-clad girl entered the\r\nlaboratory with the doctor, nor at her terrible awakening, nor when she\r\nlay grinning on the bed. Whatever it was, the glance that came from\r\nthose eyes, the smile on the full lips, or the expression of the whole\r\nface, Clarke shuddered before it in his inmost soul, and thought,\r\nunconsciously, of Dr. Phillips's words, 'the most vivid presentment of\r\nevil I have ever seen.' He turned the paper over mechanically in his\r\nhand and glanced at the back.\r\n\r\n'Good God! Clarke, what is the matter? You are as white as death.'\r\n\r\nVilliers had started wildly from his chair, as Clarke fell back with a\r\ngroan, and let the paper drop from his hands.\r\n\r\n'I don't feel very well, Villiers, I am subject to these attacks. Pour\r\nme out a little wine; thanks, that will do. I shall feel better in a few\r\nminutes.'\r\n\r\nVilliers picked up the fallen sketch and turned it over as Clarke had\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n'You saw that?' he said. 'That's how I identified it as being a portrait\r\nof Herbert's wife, or I should say his widow. How do you feel now?'\r\n\r\n'Better, thanks, it was only a passing faintness. I don't think I quite\r\ncatch your meaning. What did you say enabled you to identify the\r\npicture?'\r\n\r\n'This word--\"Helen\"--written on the back. Didn't I tell you her name was\r\nHelen? Yes; Helen Vaughan.'\r\n\r\nClarke groaned; there could be no shadow of doubt.\r\n\r\n'Now, don't you agree with me,' said Villiers, 'that in the story I have\r\ntold you to-night, and in the part this woman plays in it, there are\r\nsome very strange points?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Villiers,' Clarke muttered, 'it is a strange story indeed; a\r\nstrange story indeed. You must give me time to think it over; I may be\r\nable to help you or I may not. Must you be going now? Well, good-night,\r\nVilliers, good-night. Come and see me in the course of a week.'\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE LETTER OF ADVICE\r\n\r\n'Do you know, Austin,' said Villiers, as the two friends were pacing\r\nsedately along Piccadilly one pleasant morning in May, 'do you know I am\r\nconvinced that what you told me about Paul Street and the Herberts is a\r\nmere episode in an extraordinary history? I may as well confess to you\r\nthat when I asked you about Herbert a few months ago I had just seen\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'You had seen him? Where?'\r\n\r\n'He begged of me in the street one night. He was in the most pitiable\r\nplight, but I recognized the man, and I got him to tell me his history,\r\nor at least the outline of it. In brief, it amounted to this--he had\r\nbeen ruined by his wife.'\r\n\r\n'In what manner?'\r\n\r\n'He would not tell me; he would only say that she had destroyed him,\r\nbody and soul. The man is dead now.'\r\n\r\n'And what has become of his wife?'\r\n\r\n'Ah, that's what I should like to know, and I mean to find her sooner or\r\nlater. I know a man named Clarke, a dry fellow, in fact a man of\r\nbusiness, but shrewd enough. You understand my meaning; not shrewd in\r\nthe mere business sense of the word, but a man who really knows\r\nsomething about men and life. Well, I laid the case before him, and he\r\nwas evidently impressed. He said it needed consideration, and asked me\r\nto come again in the course of a week. A few days later I received this\r\nextraordinary letter.'\r\n\r\nAustin took the envelope, drew out the letter, and read it curiously. It\r\nran as follows:--\r\n\r\n    'MY DEAR VILLIERS,--I have thought over the matter on which you\r\n    consulted me the other night, and my advice to you is this. Throw\r\n    the portrait into the fire, blot out the story from your mind. Never\r\n    give it another thought, Villiers, or you will be sorry. You will\r\n    think, no doubt, that I am in possession of some secret information,\r\n    and to a certain extent that is the case. But I only know a little;\r\n    I am like a traveller who has peered over an abyss, and has drawn\r\n    back in terror. What I know is strange enough and horrible enough,\r\n    but beyond my knowledge there are depths and horrors more frightful\r\n    still, more incredible than any tale told of winter nights about the\r\n    fire. I have resolved, and nothing shall shake that resolve, to\r\n    explore no whit farther, and if you value your happiness you will\r\n    make the same determination.\r\n\r\n    'Come and see me by all means; but we will talk on more cheerful\r\n    topics than this.'\r\n\r\nAustin folded the letter methodically, and returned it to Villiers.\r\n\r\n'It is certainly an extraordinary letter,' he said; 'what does he mean\r\nby the portrait?'\r\n\r\n'Ah! I forgot to tell you I have been to Paul Street and have made a\r\ndiscovery.'\r\n\r\nVilliers told his story as he had told it to Clarke, and Austin listened\r\nin silence. He seemed puzzled.\r\n\r\n'How very curious that you should experience such an unpleasant\r\nsensation in that room!' he said at length. 'I hardly gather that it was\r\na mere matter of the imagination; a feeling of repulsion, in short.'\r\n\r\n'No, it was more physical than mental. It was as if I were inhaling at\r\nevery breath some deadly fume, which seemed to penetrate to every nerve\r\nand bone and sinew of my body. I felt racked from head to foot, my eyes\r\nbegan to grow dim; it was like the entrance of death.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, very strange, certainly. You see, your friend confesses that\r\nthere is some very black story connected with this woman. Did you notice\r\nany particular emotion in him when you were telling your tale?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I did. He became very faint, but he assured me that it was a mere\r\npassing attack to which he was subject.'\r\n\r\n'Did you believe him?'\r\n\r\n'I did at the time, but I don't now. He heard what I had to say with a\r\ngood deal of indifference, till I showed him the portrait. It was then\r\nhe was seized with the attack of which I spoke. He looked ghastly, I\r\nassure you.'\r\n\r\n'Then he must have seen the woman before. But there might be another\r\nexplanation; it might have been the name, and not the face, which was\r\nfamiliar to him. What do you think?'\r\n\r\n'I couldn't say. To the best of my belief it was after turning the\r\nportrait in his hands that he nearly dropped from his chair. The name,\r\nyou know, was written on the back.'\r\n\r\n'Quite so. After all, it is impossible to come to any resolution in a\r\ncase like this. I hate melodrama, and nothing strikes me as more\r\ncommonplace and tedious than the ordinary ghost story of commerce; but\r\nreally, Villiers, it looks as if there were something very queer at the\r\nbottom of all this.'\r\n\r\nThe two men had, without noticing it, turned up Ashley Street, leading\r\nnorthward from Piccadilly. It was a long street, and rather a gloomy\r\none, but here and there a brighter taste had illuminated the dark houses\r\nwith flowers, and gay curtains, and a cheerful paint on the doors.\r\nVilliers glanced up as Austin stopped speaking, and looked at one of\r\nthese houses; geraniums, red and white, drooped from every sill, and\r\ndaffodil-coloured curtains were draped back from each window.\r\n\r\n'It looks cheerful, doesn't it?' he said.\r\n\r\n'Yes, and the inside is still more cheery. One of the pleasantest houses\r\nof the season, so I have heard. I haven't been there myself, but I've\r\nmet several men who have, and they tell me it's uncommonly jovial.'\r\n\r\n'Whose house is it?'\r\n\r\n'A Mrs. Beaumont's.'\r\n\r\n'And who is she?'\r\n\r\n'I couldn't tell you. I have heard she comes from South America, but,\r\nafter all, who she is is of little consequence. She is a very wealthy\r\nwoman, there's no doubt of that, and some of the best people have taken\r\nher up. I hear she has some wonderful claret, really marvellous wine,\r\nwhich must have cost a fabulous sum. Lord Argentine was telling me about\r\nit; he was there last Sunday evening. He assures me he has never tasted\r\nsuch a wine, and Argentine, as you know, is an expert. By the way, that\r\nreminds me, she must be an oddish sort of woman, this Mrs. Beaumont.\r\nArgentine asked her how old the wine was, and what do you think she\r\nsaid? \"About a thousand years, I believe.\" Lord Argentine thought she\r\nwas chaffing him, you know, but when he laughed she said she was\r\nspeaking quite seriously, and offered to show him the jar. Of course, he\r\ncouldn't say anything more after that; but it seems rather antiquated\r\nfor a beverage, doesn't it? Why, here we are at my rooms. Come in, won't\r\nyou?'\r\n\r\n'Thanks, I think I will. I haven't seen the curiosity-shop for some\r\ntime.'\r\n\r\nIt was a room furnished richly, yet oddly, where every chair and\r\nbookcase and table, and every rug and jar and ornament seemed to be a\r\nthing apart, preserving each its own individuality.\r\n\r\n'Anything fresh lately?' said Villiers after a while.\r\n\r\n'No; I think not; you saw those queer jugs, didn't you? I thought so. I\r\ndon't think I have come across anything for the last few weeks.'\r\n\r\nAustin glanced round the room from cupboard to cupboard, from shelf to\r\nshelf, in search of some new oddity. His eyes fell at last on an old\r\nchest, pleasantly and quaintly carved, which stood in a dark corner of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n'Ah,' he said, 'I was forgetting, I have got something to show you.'\r\nAustin unlocked the chest, drew out a thick quarto volume, laid it on\r\nthe table, and resumed the cigar he had put down.\r\n\r\n'Did you know Arthur Meyrick the painter, Villiers?'\r\n\r\n'A little; I met him two or three times at the house of a friend of\r\nmine. What has become of him? I haven't heard his name mentioned for\r\nsome time.'\r\n\r\n'He's dead.'\r\n\r\n'You don't say so! Quite young, wasn't he?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; only thirty when he died.'\r\n\r\n'What did he die of?'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. He was an intimate friend of mine, and a thoroughly good\r\nfellow. He used to come here and talk to me for hours, and he was one of\r\nthe best talkers I have met. He could even talk about painting, and\r\nthat's more than can be said of most painters. About eighteen months ago\r\nhe was feeling rather overworked, and partly at my suggestion he went\r\noff on a sort of roving expedition, with no very definite end or aim\r\nabout it. I believe New York was to be his first port, but I never heard\r\nfrom him. Three months ago I got this book, with a very civil letter\r\nfrom an English doctor practising at Buenos Ayres, stating that he had\r\nattended the late Mr. Meyrick during his illness, and that the deceased\r\nhad expressed an earnest wish that the enclosed packet should be sent to\r\nme after his death. That was all.'\r\n\r\n'And haven't you written for further particulars?'\r\n\r\n'I have been thinking of doing so. You would advise me to write to the\r\ndoctor?'\r\n\r\n'Certainly. And what about the book?'\r\n\r\n'It was sealed up when I got it. I don't think the doctor had seen it.'\r\n\r\n'It is something very rare? Meyrick was a collector, perhaps?'\r\n\r\n'No, I think not, hardly a collector. Now, what do you think of those\r\nAinu jugs?'\r\n\r\n'They are peculiar, but I like them. But aren't you going to show me\r\npoor Meyrick's legacy?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, to be sure. The fact is, it's rather a peculiar sort of\r\nthing, and I haven't shown it to any one. I wouldn't say anything about\r\nit if I were you. There it is.'\r\n\r\nVilliers took the book, and opened it at haphazard.\r\n\r\n'It isn't a printed volume then?' he said.\r\n\r\n'No. It is a collection of drawings in black and white by my poor friend\r\nMeyrick.'\r\n\r\nVilliers turned to the first page, it was blank; the second bore a brief\r\ninscription, which he read:\r\n\r\n    _Silet per diem universus, nec sine horrore secretus est; lucet\r\n    nocturnis ignibus, chorus AEgipanum undique personatur: audiuntur et\r\n    cantus tibiarum, et tinnitus cymbalorum per oram maritimam._\r\n\r\nOn the third page was a design which made Villiers start and look up at\r\nAustin; he was gazing abstractedly out of the window. Villiers turned\r\npage after page, absorbed, in spite of himself, in the frightful\r\nWalpurgis Night of evil, strange monstrous evil, that the dead artist\r\nhad set forth in hard black and white. The figures of Fauns and Satyrs\r\nand AEgipans danced before his eyes, the darkness of the thicket, the\r\ndance on the mountain-top, the scenes by lonely shores, in green\r\nvineyards, by rocks and desert places, passed before him: a world before\r\nwhich the human soul seemed to shrink back and shudder. Villiers whirled\r\nover the remaining pages; he had seen enough, but the picture on the\r\nlast leaf caught his eye, as he almost closed the book.\r\n\r\n'Austin!'\r\n\r\n'Well, what is it?'\r\n\r\n'Do you know who that is?'\r\n\r\nIt was a woman's face, alone on the white page.\r\n\r\n'Know who it is? No, of course not.'\r\n\r\n'I do.'\r\n\r\n'Who is it?'\r\n\r\n'It is Mrs. Herbert.'\r\n\r\n'Are you sure?'\r\n\r\n'I am perfectly certain of it. Poor Meyrick! He is one more chapter in\r\nher history.'\r\n\r\n'But what do you think of the designs?'\r\n\r\n'They are frightful. Lock the book up again, Austin. If I were you I\r\nwould burn it; it must be a terrible companion even though it be in a\r\nchest.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, they are singular drawings. But I wonder what connection there\r\ncould be between Meyrick and Mrs. Herbert, or what link between her and\r\nthese designs?'\r\n\r\n'Ah, who can say? It is possible that the matter may end here, and we\r\nshall never know, but in my own opinion this Helen Vaughan, or Mrs.\r\nHerbert, is only the beginning. She will come back to London, Austin;\r\ndepend upon it, she will come back, and we shall hear more about her\r\nthen. I don't think it will be very pleasant news.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE SUICIDES\r\n\r\nLord Argentine was a great favourite in London Society. At twenty he had\r\nbeen a poor man, decked with the surname of an illustrious family, but\r\nforced to earn a livelihood as best he could, and the most speculative\r\nof money-lenders would not have entrusted him with fifty pounds on the\r\nchance of his ever changing his name for a title, and his poverty for a\r\ngreat fortune. His father had been near enough to the fountain of good\r\nthings to secure one of the family livings, but the son, even if he had\r\ntaken orders, would scarcely have obtained so much as this, and moreover\r\nfelt no vocation for the ecclesiastical estate. Thus he fronted the\r\nworld with no better armour than the bachelor's gown and the wits of a\r\nyounger son's grandson, with which equipment he contrived in some way to\r\nmake a very tolerable fight of it. At twenty-five Mr. Charles Aubernoun\r\nsaw himself still a man of struggles and of warfare with the world, but\r\nout of the seven who stood between him and the high places of his family\r\nthree only remained. These three, however, were 'good lives,' but yet\r\nnot proof against the Zulu assegais and typhoid fever, and so one\r\nmorning Aubernoun woke up and found himself Lord Argentine, a man of\r\nthirty who had faced the difficulties of existence, and had conquered.\r\nThe situation amused him immensely, and he resolved that riches should\r\nbe as pleasant to him as poverty had always been. Argentine, after some\r\nlittle consideration, came to the conclusion that dining, regarded as a\r\nfine art, was perhaps the most amusing pursuit open to fallen humanity,\r\nand thus his dinners became famous in London, and an invitation to his\r\ntable a thing covetously desired. After ten years of lordship and\r\ndinners Argentine still declined to be jaded, still persisted in\r\nenjoying life, and by a kind of infection had become recognized as the\r\ncause of joy in others, in short, as the best of company. His sudden and\r\ntragical death therefore caused a wide and deep sensation. People could\r\nscarce believe it, even though the newspaper was before their eyes, and\r\nthe cry of 'Mysterious Death of a Nobleman' came ringing up from the\r\nstreet. But there stood the brief paragraph: 'Lord Argentine was found\r\ndead this morning by his valet under distressing circumstances. It is\r\nstated that there can be no doubt that his lordship committed suicide,\r\nthough no motive can be assigned for the act. The deceased nobleman was\r\nwidely known in society, and much liked for his genial manner and\r\nsumptuous hospitality. He is succeeded by,' etc., etc.\r\n\r\nBy slow degrees the details came to light, but the case still remained a\r\nmystery. The chief witness at the inquest was the dead nobleman's valet,\r\nwho said that the night before his death Lord Argentine had dined with a\r\nlady of good position, whose name was suppressed in the newspaper\r\nreports. At about eleven o'clock Lord Argentine had returned, and\r\ninformed his man that he should not require his services till the next\r\nmorning. A little later the valet had occasion to cross the hall and was\r\nsomewhat astonished to see his master quietly letting himself out at the\r\nfront door. He had taken off his evening clothes, and was dressed in a\r\nNorfolk coat and knickerbockers, and wore a low brown hat. The valet had\r\nno reason to suppose that Lord Argentine had seen him, and though his\r\nmaster rarely kept late hours, thought little of the occurrence till the\r\nnext morning, when he knocked at the bedroom door at a quarter to nine\r\nas usual. He received no answer, and, after knocking two or three\r\ntimes, entered the room, and saw Lord Argentine's body leaning forward\r\nat an angle from the bottom of the bed. He found that his master had\r\ntied a cord securely to one of the short bed-posts, and, after making a\r\nrunning noose and slipping it round his neck, the unfortunate man must\r\nhave resolutely fallen forward, to die by slow strangulation. He was\r\ndressed in the light suit in which the valet had seen him go out, and\r\nthe doctor who was summoned pronounced that life had been extinct for\r\nmore than four hours. All papers, letters, and so forth seemed in\r\nperfect order, and nothing was discovered which pointed in the most\r\nremote way to any scandal either great or small. Here the evidence\r\nended; nothing more could be discovered. Several persons had been\r\npresent at the dinner-party at which Lord Argentine had assisted, and to\r\nall these he seemed in his usual genial spirits. The valet, indeed, said\r\nhe thought his master appeared a little excited when he came home, but\r\nhe confessed that the alteration in his manner was very slight, hardly\r\nnoticeable, indeed. It seemed hopeless to seek for any clue, and the\r\nsuggestion that Lord Argentine had been suddenly attacked by acute\r\nsuicidal mania was generally accepted.\r\n\r\nIt was otherwise, however, when within three weeks, three more\r\ngentlemen, one of them a nobleman, and the two others men of good\r\nposition and ample means, perished miserably in almost precisely the\r\nsame manner. Lord Swanleigh was found one morning in his dressing-room,\r\nhanging from a peg affixed to the wall, and Mr. Collier-Stuart and Mr.\r\nHerries had chosen to die as Lord Argentine. There was no explanation\r\nin either case; a few bald facts; a living man in the evening, and a\r\ndead body with a black swollen face in the morning. The police had been\r\nforced to confess themselves powerless to arrest or to explain the\r\nsordid murders of Whitechapel; but before the horrible suicides of\r\nPiccadilly and Mayfair they were dumb-foundered, for not even the mere\r\nferocity which did duty as an explanation of the crimes of the East End,\r\ncould be of service in the West. Each of these men who had resolved to\r\ndie a tortured shameful death was rich, prosperous, and to all\r\nappearances in love with the world, and not the acutest research could\r\nferret out any shadow of a lurking motive in either case. There was a\r\nhorror in the air, and men looked at one another's faces when they met,\r\neach wondering whether the other was to be the victim of the fifth\r\nnameless tragedy. Journalists sought in vain in their scrap-books for\r\nmaterials whereof to concoct reminiscent articles; and the morning paper\r\nwas unfolded in many a house with a feeling of awe; no man knew when or\r\nwhere the blow would next light.\r\n\r\nA short while after the last of these terrible events, Austin came to\r\nsee Mr. Villiers. He was curious to know whether Villiers had succeeded\r\nin discovering any fresh traces of Mrs. Herbert, either through Clarke\r\nor by other sources, and he asked the question soon after he had sat\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n'No,' said Villiers, 'I wrote to Clarke, but he remains obdurate, and I\r\nhave tried other channels, but without any result. I can't find out what\r\nbecame of Helen Vaughan after she left Paul Street, but I think she must\r\nhave gone abroad. But to tell the truth, Austin, I haven't paid very\r\nmuch attention to the matter for the last few weeks; I knew poor\r\nHerries intimately, and his terrible death has been a great shock to me,\r\na great shock.'\r\n\r\n'I can well believe it,' answered Austin gravely; 'you know Argentine\r\nwas a friend of mine. If I remember rightly, we were speaking of him\r\nthat day you came to my rooms.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; it was in connection with that house in Ashley Street, Mrs.\r\nBeaumont's house. You said something about Argentine's dining there.'\r\n\r\n'Quite so. Of course you know it was there Argentine dined the night\r\nbefore--before his death.'\r\n\r\n'No, I haven't heard that.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes; the name was kept out of the papers to spare Mrs. Beaumont.\r\nArgentine was a great favourite of hers, and it is said she was in a\r\nterrible state for some time after.'\r\n\r\nA curious look came over Villiers's face; he seemed undecided whether to\r\nspeak or not. Austin began again.\r\n\r\n'I never experienced such a feeling of horror as when I read the account\r\nof Argentine's death. I didn't understand it at the time, and I don't\r\nnow. I knew him well, and it completely passes my understanding for what\r\npossible cause he--or any of the others for the matter of that--could\r\nhave resolved in cold blood to die in such an awful manner. You know how\r\nmen babble away each other's characters in London, you may be sure any\r\nburied scandal or hidden skeleton would have been brought to light in\r\nsuch a case as this; but nothing of the sort has taken place. As for the\r\ntheory of mania, that is very well, of course, for the coroner's jury,\r\nbut everybody knows that it's all nonsense. Suicidal mania is not\r\nsmall-pox.'\r\n\r\nAustin relapsed into gloomy silence. Villiers sat silent also, watching\r\nhis friend. The expression of indecision still fleeted across his face;\r\nhe seemed as if weighing his thoughts in the balance, and the\r\nconsiderations he was revolving left him still silent. Austin tried to\r\nshake off the remembrance of tragedies as hopeless and perplexed as the\r\nlabyrinth of Daedalus, and began to talk in an indifferent voice of the\r\nmore pleasant incidents and adventures of the season.\r\n\r\n'That Mrs. Beaumont,' he said, 'of whom we were speaking, is a great\r\nsuccess; she has taken London almost by storm. I met her the other night\r\nat Fulham's; she is really a remarkable woman.'\r\n\r\n'You have met Mrs. Beaumont?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; she had quite a court around her. She would be called very\r\nhandsome, I suppose, and yet there is something about her face which I\r\ndidn't like. The features are exquisite, but the expression is strange.\r\nAnd all the time I was looking at her, and afterwards, when I was going\r\nhome, I had a curious feeling that that very expression was in some way\r\nor other familiar to me.'\r\n\r\n'You must have seen her in the Row.'\r\n\r\n'No, I am sure I never set eyes on the woman before; it is that which\r\nmakes it puzzling. And to the best of my belief I have never seen\r\nanybody like her; what I felt was a kind of dim far-off memory, vague\r\nbut persistent. The only sensation I can compare it to, is that odd\r\nfeeling one sometimes has in a dream, when fantastic cities and wondrous\r\nlands and phantom personages appear familiar and accustomed.'\r\n\r\nVilliers nodded and glanced aimlessly round the room, possibly in search\r\nof something on which to turn the conversation. His eyes fell on an old\r\nchest somewhat like that in which the artist's strange legacy lay hid\r\nbeneath a Gothic scutcheon.\r\n\r\n'Have you written to the doctor about poor Meyrick?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Yes; I wrote asking for full particulars as to his illness and death. I\r\ndon't expect to have an answer for another three weeks or a month. I\r\nthought I might as well inquire whether Meyrick knew an Englishwoman\r\nnamed Herbert, and if so, whether the doctor could give me any\r\ninformation about her. But it's very possible that Meyrick fell in with\r\nher at New York, or Mexico, or San Francisco; I have no idea as to the\r\nextent or direction of his travels.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, and it's very possible that the woman may have more than one\r\nname.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly. I wish I had thought of asking you to lend me the portrait of\r\nher which you possess. I might have enclosed it in my letter to Dr.\r\nMatthews.'\r\n\r\n'So you might; that never occurred to me. We might send it now. Hark!\r\nWhat are those boys calling?'\r\n\r\nWhile the two men had been talking together a confused noise of shouting\r\nhad been gradually growing louder. The noise rose from the eastward and\r\nswelled down Piccadilly, drawing nearer and nearer, a very torrent of\r\nsound; surging up streets usually quiet, and making every window a frame\r\nfor a face, curious or excited. The cries and voices came echoing up\r\nthe silent street where Villiers lived, growing more distinct as they\r\nadvanced, and, as Villiers spoke, an answer rang up from the pavement:\r\n\r\n'The West End Horrors; Another Awful Suicide; Full Details!'\r\n\r\nAustin rushed down the stairs and bought a paper and read out the\r\nparagraph to Villiers as the uproar in the street rose and fell. The\r\nwindow was open and the air seemed full of noise and terror.\r\n\r\n'Another gentleman has fallen a victim to the terrible epidemic of\r\nsuicide which for the last month has prevailed in the West End. Mr.\r\nSidney Crashaw, of Stoke House, Fulham, and King's Pomeroy, Devon, was\r\nfound, after a prolonged search, hanging from the branch of a tree in\r\nhis garden at one o'clock to-day. The deceased gentleman dined last\r\nnight at the Carlton Club and seemed in his usual health and spirits. He\r\nleft the Club at about ten o'clock, and was seen walking leisurely up\r\nSt. James's Street a little later. Subsequent to this his movements\r\ncannot be traced. On the discovery of the body medical aid was at once\r\nsummoned, but life had evidently been long extinct. So far as is known,\r\nMr. Crashaw had no trouble or anxiety of any kind. This painful suicide,\r\nit will be remembered, is the fifth of the kind in the last month. The\r\nauthorities at Scotland Yard are unable to suggest any explanation of\r\nthese terrible occurrences.'\r\n\r\nAustin put down the paper in mute horror.\r\n\r\n'I shall leave London to-morrow,' he said, 'it is a city of nightmares.\r\nHow awful this is, Villiers!'\r\n\r\nMr. Villiers was sitting by the window quietly looking out into the\r\nstreet. He had listened to the newspaper report attentively, and the\r\nhint of indecision was no longer on his face.\r\n\r\n'Wait a moment, Austin,' he replied, 'I have made up my mind to mention\r\na little matter that occurred last night. It is stated, I think, that\r\nCrashaw was last seen alive in St. James's Street shortly after ten?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I think so. I will look again. Yes, you are quite right.'\r\n\r\n'Quite so. Well, I am in a position to contradict that statement at all\r\nevents. Crashaw was seen after that; considerably later indeed.'\r\n\r\n'How do you know?'\r\n\r\n'Because I happened to see Crashaw myself at about two o'clock this\r\nmorning.'\r\n\r\n'You saw Crashaw? You, Villiers?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I saw him quite distinctly; indeed, there were but a few feet\r\nbetween us.'\r\n\r\n'Where, in Heaven's name, did you see him?'\r\n\r\n'Not far from here. I saw him in Ashley Street. He was just leaving a\r\nhouse.'\r\n\r\n'Did you notice what house it was?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. It was Mrs. Beaumont's.'\r\n\r\n'Villiers! Think what you are saying; there must be some mistake. How\r\ncould Crashaw be in Mrs. Beaumont's house at two o'clock in the morning?\r\nSurely, surely, you must have been dreaming, Villiers, you were always\r\nrather fanciful.'\r\n\r\n'No; I was wide awake enough. Even if I had been dreaming as you say,\r\nwhat I saw would have roused me effectually.'\r\n\r\n'What you saw? What did you see? Was there anything strange about\r\nCrashaw? But I can't believe it; it is impossible.'\r\n\r\n'Well, if you like I will tell you what I saw, or if you please, what I\r\nthink I saw, and you can judge for yourself.'\r\n\r\n'Very good, Villiers.'\r\n\r\nThe noise and clamour of the street had died away, though now and then\r\nthe sound of shouting still came from the distance, and the dull, leaden\r\nsilence seemed like the quiet after an earthquake or a storm. Villiers\r\nturned from the window and began speaking.\r\n\r\n'I was at a house near Regent's Park last night, and when I came away\r\nthe fancy took me to walk home instead of taking a hansom. It was a\r\nclear pleasant night enough, and after a few minutes I had the streets\r\npretty much to myself. It's a curious thing, Austin, to be alone in\r\nLondon at night, the gas-lamps stretching away in perspective, and the\r\ndead silence, and then perhaps the rush and clatter of a hansom on the\r\nstones, and the fire starting up under the horse's hoofs. I walked along\r\npretty briskly, for I was feeling a little tired of being out in the\r\nnight, and as the clocks were striking two I turned down Ashley Street,\r\nwhich, you know, is on my way. It was quieter than ever there, and the\r\nlamps were fewer; altogether, it looked as dark and gloomy as a forest\r\nin winter. I had done about half the length of the street when I heard a\r\ndoor closed very softly, and naturally I looked up to see who was abroad\r\nlike myself at such an hour. As it happens, there is a street lamp close\r\nto the house in question, and I saw a man standing on the step. He had\r\njust shut the door and his face was towards me, and I recognized Crashaw\r\ndirectly. I never knew him to speak to, but I had often seen him, and I\r\nam positive that I was not mistaken in my man. I looked into his face\r\nfor a moment, and then--I will confess the truth--I set off at a good\r\nrun, and kept it up till I was within my own door.'\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Why? Because it made my blood run cold to see that man's face. I could\r\nnever have supposed that such an infernal medley of passions could have\r\nglared out of any human eyes; I almost fainted as I looked. I knew I had\r\nlooked into the eyes of a lost soul, Austin, the man's outward form\r\nremained, but all hell was within it. Furious lust, and hate that was\r\nlike fire, and the loss of all hope and horror that seemed to shriek\r\naloud to the night, though his teeth were shut; and the utter blackness\r\nof despair. I am sure he did not see me; he saw nothing that you or I\r\ncan see, but he saw what I hope we never shall. I do not know when he\r\ndied; I suppose in an hour, or perhaps two, but when I passed down\r\nAshley Street and heard the closing door, that man no longer belonged to\r\nthis world; it was a devil's face I looked upon.'\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of silence in the room when Villiers ceased\r\nspeaking. The light was failing, and all the tumult of an hour ago was\r\nquite hushed. Austin had bent his head at the close of the story, and\r\nhis hand covered his eyes.\r\n\r\n'What can it mean?' he said at length.\r\n\r\n'Who knows, Austin, who knows? It's a black business, but I think we had\r\nbetter keep it to ourselves, for the present at any rate. I will see if\r\nI cannot learn anything about that house through private channels of\r\ninformation, and if I do light upon anything I will let you know.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE ENCOUNTER IN SOHO\r\n\r\nThree weeks later Austin received a note from Villiers, asking him to\r\ncall either that afternoon or the next. He chose the nearer date, and\r\nfound Villiers sitting as usual by the window, apparently lost in\r\nmeditation on the drowsy traffic of the street. There was a bamboo table\r\nby his side, a fantastic thing, enriched with gilding and queer painted\r\nscenes, and on it lay a little pile of papers arranged and docketed as\r\nneatly as anything in Mr. Clarke's office.\r\n\r\n'Well, Villiers, have you made any discoveries in the last three weeks?'\r\n\r\n'I think so; I have here one or two memoranda which struck me as\r\nsingular, and there is a statement to which I shall call your\r\nattention.'\r\n\r\n'And these documents relate to Mrs. Beaumont? It was really Crashaw whom\r\nyou saw that night standing on the doorstep of the house in Ashley\r\nStreet?'\r\n\r\n'As to that matter my belief remains unchanged, but neither my inquiries\r\nnor their results have any special relation to Crashaw. But my\r\ninvestigations have had a strange issue. I have found out who Mrs.\r\nBeaumont is!'\r\n\r\n'Who she is? In what way do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'I mean that you and I know her better under another name.'\r\n\r\n'What name is that?'\r\n\r\n'Herbert.'\r\n\r\n'Herbert!' Austin repeated the word, dazed with astonishment.\r\n\r\n'Yes, Mrs. Herbert of Paul Street, Helen Vaughan of earlier adventures\r\nunknown to me. You had reason to recognize the expression of her face;\r\nwhen you go home look at the face in Meyrick's book of horrors, and you\r\nwill know the sources of your recollection.'\r\n\r\n'And you have proof of this?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, the best of proof; I have seen Mrs. Beaumont, or shall we say Mrs.\r\nHerbert?'\r\n\r\n'Where did you see her?'\r\n\r\n'Hardly in a place where you would expect to see a lady who lives in\r\nAshley Street, Piccadilly. I saw her entering a house in one of the\r\nmeanest and most disreputable streets in Soho. In fact, I had made an\r\nappointment, though not with her, and she was precise both to time and\r\nplace.'\r\n\r\n'All this seems very wonderful, but I cannot call it incredible. You\r\nmust remember, Villiers, that I have seen this woman, in the ordinary\r\nadventure of London society, talking and laughing, and sipping her\r\ncoffee in a commonplace drawing-room with commonplace people. But you\r\nknow what you are saying.'\r\n\r\n'I do; I have not allowed myself to be led by surmises or fancies. It\r\nwas with no thought of finding Helen Vaughan that I searched for Mrs.\r\nBeaumont in the dark waters of the life of London, but such has been the\r\nissue.'\r\n\r\n'You must have been in strange places, Villiers.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I have been in very strange places. It would have been useless,\r\nyou know, to go to Ashley Street, and ask Mrs. Beaumont to give me a\r\nshort sketch of her previous history. No; assuming, as I had to assume,\r\nthat her record was not of the cleanest, it would be pretty certain that\r\nat some previous time she must have moved in circles not quite so\r\nrefined as her present ones. If you see mud on the top of a stream, you\r\nmay be sure that it was once at the bottom. I went to the bottom. I have\r\nalways been fond of diving into Queer Street for my amusement, and I\r\nfound my knowledge of that locality and its inhabitants very useful. It\r\nis, perhaps, needless to say that my friends had never heard the name of\r\nBeaumont, and as I had never seen the lady, and was quite unable to\r\ndescribe her, I had to set to work in an indirect way. The people there\r\nknow me; I have been able to do some of them a service now and again, so\r\nthey made no difficulty about giving their information; they were aware\r\nI had no communication direct or indirect with Scotland Yard. I had to\r\ncast out a good many lines, though, before I got what I wanted, and when\r\nI landed the fish I did not for a moment suppose it was my fish. But I\r\nlistened to what I was told out of a constitutional liking for useless\r\ninformation, and I found myself in possession of a very curious story,\r\nthough, as I imagined, not the story I was looking for. It was to this\r\neffect. Some five or six years ago, a woman named Raymond suddenly made\r\nher appearance in the neighbourhood to which I am referring. She was\r\ndescribed to me as being quite young, probably not more than seventeen\r\nor eighteen, very handsome, and looking as if she came from the country.\r\nI should be wrong in saying that she found her level in going to this\r\nparticular quarter, or associating with these people, for from what I\r\nwas told, I should think the worst den in London far too good for her.\r\nThe person from whom I got my information, as you may suppose, no great\r\nPuritan, shuddered and grew sick in telling me of the nameless infamies\r\nwhich were laid to her charge. After living there for a year, or perhaps\r\na little more, she disappeared as suddenly as she came, and they saw\r\nnothing of her till about the time of the Paul Street case. At first she\r\ncame to her old haunts only occasionally, then more frequently, and\r\nfinally took up her abode there as before, and remained for six or eight\r\nmonths. It's of no use my going into details as to the life that woman\r\nled; if you want particulars you can look at Meyrick's legacy. Those\r\ndesigns were not drawn from his imagination. She again disappeared, and\r\nthe people of the place saw nothing of her till a few months ago. My\r\ninformant told me that she had taken some rooms in a house which he\r\npointed out, and these rooms she was in the habit of visiting two or\r\nthree times a week and always at ten in the morning. I was led to expect\r\nthat one of these visits would be paid on a certain day about a week\r\nago, and I accordingly managed to be on the look-out in company with my\r\ncicerone at a quarter to ten, and the hour and the lady came with equal\r\npunctuality. My friend and I were standing under an archway, a little\r\nway back from the street, but she saw us, and gave me a glance that I\r\nshall be long in forgetting. That look was quite enough for me; I knew\r\nMiss Raymond to be Mrs. Herbert; as for Mrs. Beaumont she had quite gone\r\nout of my head. She went into the house, and I watched it till four\r\no'clock, when she came out, and then I followed her. It was a long\r\nchase, and I had to be very careful to keep a long way in the\r\nbackground, and yet not lose sight of the woman. She took me down to\r\nthe Strand, and then to Westminster, and then up St. James's Street, and\r\nalong Piccadilly. I felt queerish when I saw her turn up Ashley Street;\r\nthe thought that Mrs. Herbert was Mrs. Beaumont came into my mind, but\r\nit seemed too improbable to be true. I waited at the corner, keeping my\r\neye on her all the time, and I took particular care to note the house at\r\nwhich she stopped. It was the house with the gay curtains, the house of\r\nflowers, the house out of which Crashaw came the night he hanged himself\r\nin his garden. I was just going away with my discovery, when I saw an\r\nempty carriage come round and draw up in front of the house, and I came\r\nto the conclusion that Mrs. Herbert was going out for a drive, and I was\r\nright. I took a hansom and followed the carriage into the Park. There,\r\nas it happened, I met a man I know, and we stood talking together a\r\nlittle distance from the carriage-way, to which I had my back. We had\r\nnot been there for ten minutes when my friend took off his hat, and I\r\nglanced round and saw the lady I had been following all day. \"Who is\r\nthat?\" I said, and his answer was, \"Mrs. Beaumont; lives in Ashley\r\nStreet.\" Of course there could be no doubt after that. I don't know\r\nwhether she saw me, but I don't think she did. I went home at once, and,\r\non consideration, I thought that I had a sufficiently good case with\r\nwhich to go to Clarke.'\r\n\r\n'Why to Clarke?'\r\n\r\n'Because I am sure that Clarke is in possession of facts about this\r\nwoman, facts of which I know nothing.'\r\n\r\n'Well, what then?'\r\n\r\nMr. Villiers leaned back in his chair and looked reflectively at Austin\r\nfor a moment before he answered:\r\n\r\n'My idea was that Clarke and I should call on Mrs. Beaumont.'\r\n\r\n'You would never go into such a house as that? No, no, Villiers, you\r\ncannot do it. Besides, consider; what result ...'\r\n\r\n'I will tell you soon. But I was going to say that my information does\r\nnot end here; it has been completed in an extraordinary manner.\r\n\r\n'Look at this neat little packet of manuscript; it is paginated, you\r\nsee, and I have indulged in the civil coquetry of a ribbon of red tape.\r\nIt has almost a legal air, hasn't it? Run your eye over it, Austin. It\r\nis an account of the entertainment Mrs. Beaumont provided for her\r\nchoicer guests. The man who wrote this escaped with his life, but I do\r\nnot think he will live many years. The doctors tell him he must have\r\nsustained some severe shock to the nerves.'\r\n\r\nAustin took the manuscript, but never read it. Opening the neat pages at\r\nhaphazard his eye was caught by a word and a phrase that followed it;\r\nand, sick at heart, with white lips and a cold sweat pouring like water\r\nfrom his temples, he flung the paper down.\r\n\r\n'Take it away, Villiers, never speak of this again. Are you made of\r\nstone, man? Why, the dread and horror of death itself, the thoughts of\r\nthe man who stands in the keen morning air on the black platform, bound,\r\nthe bell tolling in his ears, and waits for the harsh rattle of the\r\nbolt, are as nothing compared to this. I will not read it; I should\r\nnever sleep again.'\r\n\r\n'Very good. I can fancy what you saw. Yes; it is horrible enough; but\r\nafter all, it is an old story, an old mystery played in our day, and in\r\ndim London streets instead of amidst the vineyards and the olive\r\ngardens. We know what happened to those who chanced to meet the Great\r\nGod Pan, and those who are wise know that all symbols are symbols of\r\nsomething, not of nothing. It was, indeed, an exquisite symbol beneath\r\nwhich men long ago veiled their knowledge of the most awful, most secret\r\nforces which lie at the heart of all things; forces before which the\r\nsouls of men must wither and die and blacken, as their bodies blacken\r\nunder the electric current. Such forces cannot be named, cannot be\r\nspoken, cannot be imagined except under a veil and a symbol, a symbol to\r\nthe most of us appearing a quaint, poetic fancy, to some a foolish tale.\r\nBut you and I, at all events, have known something of the terror that\r\nmay dwell in the secret place of life, manifested under human flesh;\r\nthat which is without form taking to itself a form. Oh, Austin, how can\r\nit be? How is it that the very sunlight does not turn to blackness\r\nbefore this thing, the hard earth melt and boil beneath such a burden?'\r\n\r\nVilliers was pacing up and down the room, and the beads of sweat stood\r\nout on his forehead. Austin sat silent for a while, but Villiers saw him\r\nmake a sign upon his breast.\r\n\r\n'I say again, Villiers, you will surely never enter such a house as\r\nthat? You would never pass out alive.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Austin, I shall go out alive--I, and Clarke with me.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean? You cannot, you would not dare ...'\r\n\r\n'Wait a moment. The air was very pleasant and fresh this morning; there\r\nwas a breeze blowing, even through this dull street, and I thought I\r\nwould take a walk. Piccadilly stretched before me a clear, bright vista,\r\nand the sun flashed on the carriages and on the quivering leaves in the\r\npark. It was a joyous morning, and men and women looked at the sky and\r\nsmiled as they went about their work or their pleasure, and the wind\r\nblew as blithely as upon the meadows and the scented gorse. But somehow\r\nor other I got out of the bustle and the gaiety, and found myself\r\nwalking slowly along a quiet, dull street, where there seemed to be no\r\nsunshine and no air, and where the few foot-passengers loitered as they\r\nwalked, and hung indecisively about corners and archways. I walked\r\nalong, hardly knowing where I was going or what I did there, but feeling\r\nimpelled, as one sometimes is, to explore still further, with a vague\r\nidea of reaching some unknown goal. Thus I forged up the street, noting\r\nthe small traffic of the milk-shop, and wondering at the incongruous\r\nmedley of penny pipes, black tobacco, sweets, newspapers, and comic\r\nsongs which here and there jostled one another in the short compass of a\r\nsingle window. I think it was a cold shudder that suddenly passed\r\nthrough me that first told me that I had found what I wanted. I looked\r\nup from the pavement and stopped before a dusty shop, above which the\r\nlettering had faded, where the red bricks of two hundred years ago had\r\ngrimed to black; where the windows had gathered to themselves the fog\r\nand the dirt of winters innumerable. I saw what I required; but I think\r\nit was five minutes before I had steadied myself and could walk in and\r\nask for it in a cool voice and with a calm face. I think there must\r\neven then have been a tremor in my words, for the old man who came out\r\nfrom his back parlour, and fumbled slowly amongst his goods, looked\r\noddly at me as he tied the parcel. I paid what he asked, and stood\r\nleaning by the counter, with a strange reluctance to take up my goods\r\nand go. I asked about the business, and learnt that trade was bad and\r\nthe profits cut down sadly; but then the street was not what it was\r\nbefore traffic had been diverted, but that was done forty years ago,\r\n\"just before my father died,\" he said. I got away at last, and walked\r\nalong sharply; it was a dismal street indeed, and I was glad to return\r\nto the bustle and the noise. Would you like to see my purchase?'\r\n\r\nAustin said nothing, but nodded his head slightly; he still looked white\r\nand sick. Villiers pulled out a drawer in the bamboo table, and showed\r\nAustin a long coil of cord, hard and new; and at one end was a running\r\nnoose.\r\n\r\n'It is the best hempen cord,' said Villiers, 'just as it used to be made\r\nfor the old trade, the man told me. Not an inch of jute from end to\r\nend.'\r\n\r\nAustin set his teeth hard, and stared at Villiers, growing whiter as he\r\nlooked.\r\n\r\n'You would not do it,' he murmured at last. 'You would not have blood on\r\nyour hands. My God!' he exclaimed, with sudden vehemence, 'you cannot\r\nmean this, Villiers, that you will make yourself a hangman?'\r\n\r\n'No. I shall offer a choice, and leave Helen Vaughan alone with this\r\ncord in a locked room for fifteen minutes. If when we go in it is not\r\ndone, I shall call the nearest policeman. That is all.'\r\n\r\n'I must go now. I cannot stay here any longer; I cannot bear this.\r\nGood-night.'\r\n\r\n'Good-night, Austin.'\r\n\r\nThe door shut, but in a moment it was opened again, and Austin stood,\r\nwhite and ghastly, in the entrance.\r\n\r\n'I was forgetting,' he said, 'that I too have something to tell. I have\r\nreceived a letter from Dr. Harding of Buenos Ayres. He says that he\r\nattended Meyrick for three weeks before his death.'\r\n\r\n'And does he say what carried him off in the prime of life? It was not\r\nfever?'\r\n\r\n'No, it was not fever. According to the doctor, it was an utter collapse\r\nof the whole system, probably caused by some severe shock. But he states\r\nthat the patient would tell him nothing, and that he was consequently at\r\nsome disadvantage in treating the case.'\r\n\r\n'Is there anything more?'\r\n\r\n'Yes. Dr. Harding ends his letter by saying: \"I think this is all the\r\ninformation I can give you about your poor friend. He had not been long\r\nin Buenos Ayres, and knew scarcely any one, with the exception of a\r\nperson who did not bear the best of characters, and has since left--a\r\nMrs. Vaughan.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE FRAGMENTS\r\n\r\n    [Amongst the papers of the well-known physician, Dr. Robert\r\n    Matheson, of Ashley Street, Piccadilly, who died suddenly, of\r\n    apoplectic seizure, at the beginning of 1892, a leaf of manuscript\r\n    paper was found, covered with pencil jottings. These notes were in\r\n    Latin, much abbreviated, and had evidently been made in great haste.\r\n    The MS. was only deciphered with great difficulty, and some words\r\n    have up to the present time evaded all the efforts of the expert\r\n    employed. The date, 'XXV Jul. 1888,' is written on the right-hand\r\n    corner of the MS. The following is a translation of Dr. Matheson's\r\n    manuscript.]\r\n\r\n'Whether science would benefit by these brief notes if they could be\r\npublished, I do not know, but rather doubt. But certainly I shall never\r\ntake the responsibility of publishing or divulging one word of what is\r\nhere written, not only on account of my oath freely given to those two\r\npersons who were present, but also because the details are too\r\nabominable. It is probably that, upon mature consideration, and after\r\nweighing the good and evil, I shall one day destroy this paper, or at\r\nleast leave it under seal to my friend D., trusting in his discretion,\r\nto use it or to burn it, as he may think fit.\r\n\r\n'As was befitting, I did all that my knowledge suggested to make sure\r\nthat I was suffering under no delusion. At first astounded, I could\r\nhardly think, but in a minute's time I was sure that my pulse was steady\r\nand regular, and that I was in my real and true senses. I then fixed my\r\neyes quietly on what was before me.\r\n\r\n'Though horror and revolting nausea rose up within me, and an odour of\r\ncorruption choked my breath, I remained firm. I was then privileged or\r\naccursed, I dare not say which, to see that which was on the bed, lying\r\nthere black like ink, transformed before my eyes. The skin, and the\r\nflesh, and the muscles, and the bones, and the firm structure of the\r\nhuman body that I had thought to be unchangeable, and permanent as\r\nadamant, began to melt and dissolve.\r\n\r\n'I knew that the body may be separated into its elements by external\r\nagencies, but I should have refused to believe what I saw. For here\r\nthere was some internal force, of which I knew nothing, that caused\r\ndissolution and change.\r\n\r\n'Here too was all the work by which man had been made repeated before my\r\neyes. I saw the form waver from sex to sex, dividing itself from itself,\r\nand then again reunited. Then I saw the body descend to the beasts\r\nwhence it ascended, and that which was on the heights go down to the\r\ndepths, even to the abyss of all being. The principle of life, which\r\nmakes organism, always remained, while the outward form changed.\r\n\r\n'The light within the room had turned to blackness, not the darkness of\r\nnight, in which objects are seen dimly, for I could see clearly and\r\nwithout difficulty. But it was the negation of light; objects were\r\npresented to my eyes, if I may say so, without any medium, in such a\r\nmanner that if there had been a prism in the room I should have seen no\r\ncolours represented in it.\r\n\r\n'I watched, and at last I saw nothing but a substance as jelly. Then the\r\nladder was ascended again ... [_here the MS. is illegible_] ... for one\r\ninstant I saw a Form, shaped in dimness before me, which I will not\r\nfarther describe. But the symbol of this form may be seen in ancient\r\nsculptures, and in paintings which survived beneath the lava, too foul\r\nto be spoken of ... as a horrible and unspeakable shape, neither man nor\r\nbeast, was changed into human form, there came finally death.\r\n\r\n'I who saw all this, not without great horror and loathing of soul, here\r\nwrite my name, declaring all that I have set on this paper to be true.\r\n\r\n                                           'ROBERT MATHESON, Med. Dr.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... Such, Raymond, is the story of what I know and what I have seen. The\r\nburden of it was too heavy for me to bear alone, and yet I could tell it\r\nto none but you. Villiers, who was with me at the last, knows nothing of\r\nthat awful secret of the wood, of how what we both saw die, lay upon the\r\nsmooth, sweet turf amidst the summer flowers, half in sun and half in\r\nshadow, and holding the girl Rachel's hand, called and summoned those\r\ncompanions, and shaped in solid form, upon the earth we tread on, the\r\nhorror which we can but hint at, which we can only name under a figure.\r\nI would not tell Villiers of this, nor of that resemblance, which struck\r\nme as with a blow upon my heart, when I saw the portrait, which filled\r\nthe cup of terror at the end. What this can mean I dare not guess. I\r\nknow that what I saw perish was not Mary, and yet in the last agony\r\nMary's eyes looked into mine. Whether there be any one who can show the\r\nlast link in this chain of awful mystery, I do not know, but if there be\r\nany one who can do this, you, Raymond, are the man. And if you know the\r\nsecret, it rests with you to tell it or not, as you please.\r\n\r\nI am writing this letter to you immediately on my getting back to town.\r\nI have been in the country for the last few days; perhaps you may be\r\nable to guess in what part. While the horror and wonder of London was at\r\nits height--for 'Mrs. Beaumont,' as I have told you, was well known in\r\nsociety--I wrote to my friend Dr. Phillips, giving some brief outline,\r\nor rather hint, of what had happened, and asking him to tell me the name\r\nof the village where the events he had related to me occurred. He gave\r\nme the name, as he said with the less hesitation, because Rachel's\r\nfather and mother were dead, and the rest of the family had gone to a\r\nrelative in the State of Washington six months before. The parents, he\r\nsaid, had undoubtedly died of grief and horror caused by the terrible\r\ndeath of their daughter, and by what had gone before that death. On the\r\nevening of the day on which I received Phillips's letter I was at\r\nCaermaen, and standing beneath the mouldering Roman walls, white with\r\nthe winters of seventeen hundred years, I looked over the meadow where\r\nonce had stood the older temple of the 'God of the Deeps,' and saw a\r\nhouse gleaming in the sunlight. It was the house where Helen had lived.\r\nI stayed at Caermaen for several days. The people of the place, I found,\r\nknew little and had guessed less. Those whom I spoke to on the matter\r\nseemed surprised that an antiquarian (as I professed myself to be)\r\nshould trouble about a village tragedy, of which they gave a very\r\ncommonplace version, and, as you may imagine, I told nothing of what I\r\nknew. Most of my time was spent in the great wood that rises just above\r\nthe village and climbs the hillside, and goes down to the river in the\r\nvalley; such another long lovely valley, Raymond, as that on which we\r\nlooked one summer night, walking to and fro before your house. For many\r\nan hour I strayed through the maze of the forest, turning now to right\r\nand now to left, pacing slowly down long alleys of undergrowth, shadowy\r\nand chill, even under the midday sun, and halting beneath great oaks;\r\nlying on the short turf of a clearing where the faint sweet scent of\r\nwild roses came to me on the wind and mixed with the heavy perfume of\r\nthe elder, whose mingled odour is like the odour of the room of the\r\ndead, a vapour of incense and corruption. I stood at the edges of the\r\nwood, gazing at all the pomp and procession of the foxgloves towering\r\namidst the bracken and shining red in the broad sunshine, and beyond\r\nthem into deep thickets of close undergrowth where springs boil up from\r\nthe rock and nourish the water-weeds, dank and evil. But in all my\r\nwanderings I avoided one part of the wood; it was not till yesterday\r\nthat I climbed to the summit of the hill, and stood upon the ancient\r\nRoman road that threads the highest ridge of the wood. Here they had\r\nwalked, Helen and Rachel, along this quiet causeway, upon the pavement\r\nof green turf, shut in on either side by high banks of red earth, and\r\ntall hedges of shining beech, and here I followed in their steps,\r\nlooking out, now and again, through partings in the boughs, and seeing\r\non one side the sweep of the wood stretching far to right and left, and\r\nsinking into the broad level, and beyond, the yellow sea, and the land\r\nover the sea. On the other side was the valley and the river and hill\r\nfollowing hill as wave on wave, and wood and meadow, and cornfield, and\r\nwhite houses gleaming, and a great wall of mountain, and far blue peaks\r\nin the north. And so at last I came to the place. The track went up a\r\ngentle slope, and widened out into an open space with a wall of thick\r\nundergrowth around it, and then, narrowing again, passed on into the\r\ndistance and the faint blue mist of summer heat. And into this pleasant\r\nsummer glade Rachel passed a girl, and left it, who shall say what? I\r\ndid not stay long there.\r\n\r\nIn a small town near Caermaen there is a museum, containing for the most\r\npart Roman remains which have been found in the neighbourhood at various\r\ntimes. On the day after my arrival at Caermaen I walked over to the\r\ntown in question, and took the opportunity of inspecting this museum.\r\nAfter I had seen most of the sculptured stones, the coffins, rings,\r\ncoins, and fragments of tessellated pavement which the place contains, I\r\nwas shown a small square pillar of white stone, which had been recently\r\ndiscovered in the wood of which I have been speaking, and, as I found on\r\ninquiry, in that open space where the Roman road broadens out. On one\r\nside of the pillar was an inscription, of which I took a note. Some of\r\nthe letters have been defaced, but I do not think there can be any doubt\r\nas to those which I supply. The inscription is as follows:\r\n\r\n    DEVOMNODENT_i_\r\n    FLA_v_IVSSENILISPOSSV_it_\r\n    PROPTERNVP_tias_\r\n    _qua_SVIDITSVBVMB_ra_\r\n\r\n'To the great god Nodens (the god of the Great Deep or Abyss) Flavius\r\nSenilis has erected this pillar on account of the marriage which he saw\r\nbeneath the shade.'\r\n\r\nThe custodian of the museum informed me that local antiquaries were much\r\npuzzled, not by the inscription, or by any difficulty in translating it,\r\nbut as to the circumstance or rite to which allusion is made.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n... And now, my dear Clarke, as to what you tell me about Helen Vaughan,\r\nwhom you say you saw die under circumstances of the utmost and almost\r\nincredible horror. I was interested in your account, but a good deal,\r\nnay all, of what you told me I knew already. I can understand the\r\nstrange likeness you remarked both in the portrait and in the actual\r\nface; you have seen Helen's mother. You remember that still summer night\r\nso many years ago, when I talked to you of the world beyond the shadows,\r\nand of the god Pan. You remember Mary. She was the mother of Helen\r\nVaughan, who was born nine months after that night.\r\n\r\nMary never recovered her reason. She lay, as you saw her, all the while\r\nupon her bed, and a few days after the child was born she died. I fancy\r\nthat just at the last she knew me; I was standing by the bed, and the\r\nold look came into her eyes for a second, and then she shuddered and\r\ngroaned and died. It was an ill work I did that night when you were\r\npresent; I broke open the door of the house of life, without knowing or\r\ncaring what might pass forth or enter in. I recollect your telling me at\r\nthe time, sharply enough, and rightly enough too, in one sense, that I\r\nhad ruined the reason of a human being by a foolish experiment, based on\r\nan absurd theory. You did well to blame me, but my theory was not all\r\nabsurdity. What I said Mary would see, she saw, but I forgot that no\r\nhuman eyes could look on such a vision with impunity. And I forgot, as I\r\nhave just said, that when the house of life is thus thrown open, there\r\nmay enter in that for which we have no name, and human flesh may become\r\nthe veil of a horror one dare not express. I played with energies which\r\nI did not understand, and you have seen the ending of it. Helen Vaughan\r\ndid well to bind the cord about her neck and die, though the death was\r\nhorrible. The blackened face, the hideous form upon the bed, changing\r\nand melting before your eyes from woman to man, from man to beast, and\r\nfrom beast to worse than beast, all the strange horror that you\r\nwitnessed, surprises me but little. What you say the doctor whom you\r\nsent for saw and shuddered at I noticed long ago; I knew what I had done\r\nthe moment the child was born, and when it was scarcely five years old I\r\nsurprised it, not once or twice but several times with a playmate, you\r\nmay guess of what kind. It was for me a constant, an incarnate horror,\r\nand after a few years I felt I could bear it no longer, and I sent Helen\r\nVaughan away. You know now what frightened the boy in the wood. The rest\r\nof the strange story, and all else that you tell me, as discovered by\r\nyour friend, I have contrived to learn from time to time, almost to the\r\nlast chapter. And now Helen is with her companions....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Inmost Light\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOne evening in autumn, when the deformities of London were veiled in\r\nfaint blue mist, and its vistas and far-reaching streets seemed\r\nsplendid, Mr. Charles Salisbury was slowly pacing down Rupert Street,\r\ndrawing nearer to his favourite restaurant by slow degrees. His eyes\r\nwere downcast in study of the pavement, and thus it was that as he\r\npassed in at the narrow door a man who had come up from the lower end of\r\nthe street jostled against him.\r\n\r\n'I beg your pardon--wasn't looking where I was going. Why, it's Dyson!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, quite so. How are you, Salisbury?'\r\n\r\n'Quite well. But where have you been, Dyson? I don't think I can have\r\nseen you for the last five years?'\r\n\r\n'No; I dare say not. You remember I was getting rather hard up when you\r\ncame to my place at Charlotte Street?'\r\n\r\n'Perfectly. I think I remember your telling me that you owed five weeks'\r\nrent, and that you had parted with your watch for a comparatively small\r\nsum.'\r\n\r\n'My dear Salisbury, your memory is admirable. Yes, I was hard up. But\r\nthe curious thing is that soon after you saw me I became harder up. My\r\nfinancial state was described by a friend as \"stone broke.\" I don't\r\napprove of slang, mind you, but such was my condition. But suppose we go\r\nin; there might be other people who would like to dine--it's a human\r\nweakness, Salisbury.'\r\n\r\n'Certainly; come along. I was wondering as I walked down whether the\r\ncorner table were taken. It has a velvet back, you know.'\r\n\r\n'I know the spot; it's vacant. Yes, as I was saying, I became even\r\nharder up.'\r\n\r\n'What did you do then?' asked Salisbury, disposing of his hat, and\r\nsettling down in the corner of the seat, with a glance of fond\r\nanticipation at the _menu_.\r\n\r\n'What did I do? Why, I sat down and reflected. I had a good classical\r\neducation, and a positive distaste for business of any kind: that was\r\nthe capital with which I faced the world. Do you know, I have heard\r\npeople describe olives as nasty! What lamentable Philistinism! I have\r\noften thought, Salisbury, that I could write genuine poetry under the\r\ninfluence of olives and red wine. Let us have Chianti; it may not be\r\nvery good, but the flasks are simply charming.'\r\n\r\n'It is pretty good here. We may as well have a big flask.'\r\n\r\n'Very good. I reflected, then, on my want of prospects, and I determined\r\nto embark in literature.'\r\n\r\n'Really; that was strange. You seem in pretty comfortable circumstances,\r\nthough.'\r\n\r\n'Though! What a satire upon a noble profession. I am afraid, Salisbury,\r\nyou haven't a proper idea of the dignity of an artist. You see me\r\nsitting at my desk--or at least you can see me if you care to call--with\r\npen and ink, and simple nothingness before me, and if you come again in\r\na few hours you will (in all probability) find a creation!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, quite so. I had an idea that literature was not remunerative.'\r\n\r\n'You are mistaken; its rewards are great. I may mention, by the way,\r\nthat shortly after you saw me I succeeded to a small income. An uncle\r\ndied, and proved unexpectedly generous.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, I see. That must have been convenient.'\r\n\r\n'It was pleasant--undeniably pleasant. I have always considered it in\r\nthe light of an endowment of my researches. I told you I was a man of\r\nletters; it would, perhaps, be more correct to describe myself as a man\r\nof science.'\r\n\r\n'Dear me, Dyson, you have really changed very much in the last few\r\nyears. I had a notion, don't you know, that you were a sort of idler\r\nabout town, the kind of man one might meet on the north side of\r\nPiccadilly every day from May to July.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly. I was even then forming myself, though all unconsciously. You\r\nknow my poor father could not afford to send me to the University. I\r\nused to grumble in my ignorance at not having completed my education.\r\nThat was the folly of youth, Salisbury; my University was Piccadilly.\r\nThere I began to study the great science which still occupies me.'\r\n\r\n'What science do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'The science of the great city; the physiology of London; literally and\r\nmetaphysically the greatest subject that the mind of man can conceive.\r\nWhat an admirable _salmi_ this is; undoubtedly the final end of the\r\npheasant. Yet I feel sometimes positively overwhelmed with the thought\r\nof the vastness and complexity of London. Paris a man may get to\r\nunderstand thoroughly with a reasonable amount of study; but London is\r\nalways a mystery. In Paris you may say: \"Here live the actresses, here\r\nthe Bohemians, and the _Rates_\"; but it is different in London. You may\r\npoint out a street, correctly enough, as the abode of washerwomen; but,\r\nin that second floor, a man may be studying Chaldee roots, and in the\r\ngarret over the way a forgotten artist is dying by inches.'\r\n\r\n'I see you are Dyson, unchanged and unchangeable,' said Salisbury,\r\nslowly sipping his Chianti. 'I think you are misled by a too fervid\r\nimagination; the mystery of London exists only in your fancy. It seems\r\nto me a dull place enough. We seldom hear of a really artistic crime in\r\nLondon, whereas I believe Paris abounds in that sort of thing.'\r\n\r\n'Give me some more wine. Thanks. You are mistaken, my dear fellow, you\r\nare really mistaken. London has nothing to be ashamed of in the way of\r\ncrime. Where we fail is for want of Homers, not Agamemnons. _Carent quia\r\nvate sacro_, you know.'\r\n\r\n'I recall the quotation. But I don't think I quite follow you.'\r\n\r\n'Well, in plain language, we have no good writers in London who make a\r\nspeciality of that kind of thing. Our common reporter is a dull dog;\r\nevery story that he has to tell is spoilt in the telling. His idea of\r\nhorror and of what excites horror is so lamentably deficient. Nothing\r\nwill content the fellow but blood, vulgar red blood, and when he can get\r\nit he lays it on thick, and considers that he has produced a telling\r\narticle. It's a poor notion. And, by some curious fatality, it is the\r\nmost commonplace and brutal murders which always attract the most\r\nattention and get written up the most. For instance, I dare say that\r\nyou never heard of the Harlesden case?'\r\n\r\n'No; no, I don't remember anything about it.'\r\n\r\n'Of course not. And yet the story is a curious one. I will tell it you\r\nover our coffee. Harlesden, you know, or I expect you don't know, is\r\nquite on the out-quarters of London; something curiously different from\r\nyour fine old crusted suburb like Norwood or Hampstead, different as\r\neach of these is from the other. Hampstead, I mean, is where you look\r\nfor the head of your great China house with his three acres of land and\r\npine-houses, though of late there is the artistic substratum; while\r\nNorwood is the home of the prosperous middle-class family who took the\r\nhouse \"because it was near the Palace,\" and sickened of the Palace six\r\nmonths afterwards; but Harlesden is a place of no character. It's too\r\nnew to have any character as yet. There are the rows of red houses and\r\nthe rows of white houses and the bright green Venetians, and the\r\nblistering doorways, and the little backyards they call gardens, and a\r\nfew feeble shops, and then, just as you think you're going to grasp the\r\nphysiognomy of the settlement, it all melts away.'\r\n\r\n'How the dickens is that? the houses don't tumble down before one's\r\neyes, I suppose!'\r\n\r\n'Well, no, not exactly that. But Harlesden as an entity disappears. Your\r\nstreet turns into a quiet lane, and your staring houses into elm trees,\r\nand the back-gardens into green meadows. You pass instantly from town to\r\ncountry; there is no transition as in a small country town, no soft\r\ngradations of wider lawns and orchards, with houses gradually becoming\r\nless dense, but a dead stop. I believe the people who live there mostly\r\ngo into the City. I have seen once or twice a laden 'bus bound\r\nthitherwards. But however that may be, I can't conceive a greater\r\nloneliness in a desert at midnight than there is there at midday. It is\r\nlike a city of the dead; the streets are glaring and desolate, and as\r\nyou pass it suddenly strikes you that this too is part of London. Well,\r\na year or two ago there was a doctor living there; he had set up his\r\nbrass plate and his red lamp at the very end of one of those shining\r\nstreets, and from the back of the house, the fields stretched away to\r\nthe north. I don't know what his reason was in settling down in such an\r\nout-of-the-way place, perhaps Dr. Black, as we will call him, was a\r\nfar-seeing man and looked ahead. His relations, so it appeared\r\nafterwards, had lost sight of him for many years and didn't even know he\r\nwas a doctor, much less where he lived. However, there he was settled in\r\nHarlesden, with some fragments of a practice, and an uncommonly pretty\r\nwife. People used to see them walking out together in the summer\r\nevenings soon after they came to Harlesden, and, so far as could be\r\nobserved, they seemed a very affectionate couple. These walks went on\r\nthrough the autumn, and then ceased; but, of course, as the days grew\r\ndark and the weather cold, the lanes near Harlesden might be expected to\r\nlose many of their attractions. All through the winter nobody saw\r\nanything of Mrs. Black; the doctor used to reply to his patients'\r\ninquiries that she was a \"little out of sorts, would be better, no\r\ndoubt, in the spring.\" But the spring came, and the summer, and no Mrs.\r\nBlack appeared, and at last people began to rumour and talk amongst\r\nthemselves, and all sorts of queer things were said at \"high teas,\"\r\nwhich you may possibly have heard are the only form of entertainment\r\nknown in such suburbs. Dr. Black began to surprise some very odd looks\r\ncast in his direction, and the practice, such as it was, fell off before\r\nhis eyes. In short, when the neighbours whispered about the matter, they\r\nwhispered that Mrs. Black was dead, and that the doctor had made away\r\nwith her. But this wasn't the case; Mrs. Black was seen alive in June.\r\nIt was a Sunday afternoon, one of those few exquisite days that an\r\nEnglish climate offers, and half London had strayed out into the fields,\r\nnorth, south, east, and west to smell the scent of the white May, and to\r\nsee if the wild roses were yet in blossom in the hedges. I had gone out\r\nmyself early in the morning, and had had a long ramble, and somehow or\r\nother as I was steering homeward I found myself in this very Harlesden\r\nwe have been talking about. To be exact, I had a glass of beer in the\r\n\"General Gordon,\" the most flourishing house in the neighbourhood, and\r\nas I was wandering rather aimlessly about, I saw an uncommonly tempting\r\ngap in a hedgerow, and resolved to explore the meadow beyond. Soft grass\r\nis very grateful to the feet after the infernal grit strewn on suburban\r\nsidewalks, and after walking about for some time I thought I should like\r\nto sit down on a bank and have a smoke. While I was getting out my\r\npouch, I looked up in the direction of the houses, and as I looked I\r\nfelt my breath caught back, and my teeth began to chatter, and the stick\r\nI had in one hand snapped in two with the grip I gave it. It was as if I\r\nhad had an electric current down my spine, and yet for some moment of\r\ntime which seemed long, but which must have been very short, I caught\r\nmyself wondering what on earth was the matter. Then I knew what had\r\nmade my very heart shudder and my bones grind together in an agony. As I\r\nglanced up I had looked straight towards the last house in the row\r\nbefore me, and in an upper window of that house I had seen for some\r\nshort fraction of a second a face. It was the face of a woman, and yet\r\nit was not human. You and I, Salisbury, have heard in our time, as we\r\nsat in our seats in church in sober English fashion, of a lust that\r\ncannot be satiated and of a fire that is unquenchable, but few of us\r\nhave any notion what these words mean. I hope you never may, for as I\r\nsaw that face at the window, with the blue sky above me and the warm air\r\nplaying in gusts about me, I knew I had looked into another\r\nworld--looked through the window of a commonplace, brand-new house, and\r\nseen hell open before me. When the first shock was over, I thought once\r\nor twice that I should have fainted; my face streamed with a cold sweat,\r\nand my breath came and went in sobs, as if I had been half drowned. I\r\nmanaged to get up at last, and walked round to the street, and there I\r\nsaw the name \"Dr. Black\" on the post by the front gate. As fate or my\r\nluck would have it, the door opened and a man came down the steps as I\r\npassed by. I had no doubt it was the doctor himself. He was of a type\r\nrather common in London; long and thin, with a pasty face and a dull\r\nblack moustache. He gave me a look as we passed each other on the\r\npavement, and though it was merely the casual glance which one\r\nfoot-passenger bestows on another, I felt convinced in my mind that here\r\nwas an ugly customer to deal with. As you may imagine, I went my way a\r\ngood deal puzzled and horrified too by what I had seen; for I had paid\r\nanother visit to the \"General Gordon,\" and had got together a good deal\r\nof the common gossip of the place about the Blacks. I didn't mention the\r\nfact that I had seen a woman's face in the window; but I heard that Mrs.\r\nBlack had been much admired for her beautiful golden hair, and round\r\nwhat had struck me with such a nameless terror, there was a mist of\r\nflowing yellow hair, as it were an aureole of glory round the visage of\r\na satyr. The whole thing bothered me in an indescribable manner; and\r\nwhen I got home I tried my best to think of the impression I had\r\nreceived as an illusion, but it was no use. I knew very well I had seen\r\nwhat I have tried to describe to you, and I was morally certain that I\r\nhad seen Mrs. Black. And then there was the gossip of the place, the\r\nsuspicion of foul play, which I knew to be false, and my own conviction\r\nthat there was some deadly mischief or other going on in that bright red\r\nhouse at the corner of Devon Road: how to construct a theory of a\r\nreasonable kind out of these two elements. In short, I found myself in a\r\nworld of mystery; I puzzled my head over it and filled up my leisure\r\nmoments by gathering together odd threads of speculation, but I never\r\nmoved a step towards any real solution, and as the summer days went on\r\nthe matter seemed to grow misty and indistinct, shadowing some vague\r\nterror, like a nightmare of last month. I suppose it would before long\r\nhave faded into the background of my brain--I should not have forgotten\r\nit, for such a thing could never be forgotten--but one morning as I was\r\nlooking over the paper my eye was caught by a heading over some two\r\ndozen lines of small type. The words I had seen were simply, \"The\r\nHarlesden Case,\" and I knew what I was going to read. Mrs. Black was\r\ndead. Black had called in another medical man to certify as to cause of\r\ndeath, and something or other had aroused the strange doctor's\r\nsuspicions and there had been an inquest and _post-mortem_. And the\r\nresult? That, I will confess, did astonish me considerably; it was the\r\ntriumph of the unexpected. The two doctors who made the autopsy were\r\nobliged to confess that they could not discover the faintest trace of\r\nany kind of foul play; their most exquisite tests and reagents failed to\r\ndetect the presence of poison in the most infinitesimal quantity. Death,\r\nthey found, had been caused by a somewhat obscure and scientifically\r\ninteresting form of brain disease. The tissue of the brain and the\r\nmolecules of the grey matter had undergone a most extraordinary series\r\nof changes; and the younger of the two doctors, who has some reputation,\r\nI believe, as a specialist in brain trouble, made some remarks in giving\r\nhis evidence which struck me deeply at the time, though I did not then\r\ngrasp their full significance. He said: \"At the commencement of the\r\nexamination I was astonished to find appearances of a character entirely\r\nnew to me, notwithstanding my somewhat large experience. I need not\r\nspecify these appearances at present, it will be sufficient for me to\r\nstate that as I proceeded in my task I could scarcely believe that the\r\nbrain before me was that of a human being at all.\" There was some\r\nsurprise at this statement, as you may imagine, and the coroner asked\r\nthe doctor if he meant to say that the brain resembled that of an\r\nanimal. \"No,\" he replied, \"I should not put it in that way. Some of the\r\nappearances I noticed seemed to point in that direction, but others, and\r\nthese were the more surprising, indicated a nervous organization of a\r\nwholly different character from that either of man or the lower\r\nanimals.\" It was a curious thing to say, but of course the jury brought\r\nin a verdict of death from natural causes, and, so far as the public was\r\nconcerned, the case came to an end. But after I had read what the doctor\r\nsaid I made up my mind that I should like to know a good deal more, and\r\nI set to work on what seemed likely to prove an interesting\r\ninvestigation. I had really a good deal of trouble, but I was successful\r\nin a measure. Though why--my dear fellow, I had no notion at the time.\r\nAre you aware that we have been here nearly four hours? The waiters are\r\nstaring at us. Let's have the bill and be gone.'\r\n\r\nThe two men went out in silence, and stood a moment in the cool air,\r\nwatching the hurrying traffic of Coventry Street pass before them to the\r\naccompaniment of the ringing bells of hansoms and the cries of the\r\nnewsboys; the deep far murmur of London surging up ever and again from\r\nbeneath these louder noises.\r\n\r\n'It is a strange case, isn't it?' said Dyson at length. 'What do you\r\nthink of it?'\r\n\r\n'My dear fellow, I haven't heard the end, so I will reserve my opinion.\r\nWhen will you give me the sequel?'\r\n\r\n'Come to my rooms some evening; say next Thursday. Here's the address.\r\nGood-night; I want to get down to the Strand.' Dyson hailed a passing\r\nhansom, and Salisbury turned northward to walk home to his lodgings.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMr. Salisbury, as may have been gathered from the few remarks which he\r\nhad found it possible to introduce in the course of the evening, was a\r\nyoung gentleman of a peculiarly solid form of intellect, coy and\r\nretiring before the mysterious and the uncommon, with a constitutional\r\ndislike of paradox. During the restaurant dinner he had been forced to\r\nlisten in almost absolute silence to a strange tissue of improbabilities\r\nstrung together with the ingenuity of a born meddler in plots and\r\nmysteries, and it was with a feeling of weariness that he crossed\r\nShaftesbury Avenue, and dived into the recesses of Soho, for his\r\nlodgings were in a modest neighbourhood to the north of Oxford Street.\r\nAs he walked he speculated on the probable fate of Dyson, relying on\r\nliterature, unbefriended by a thoughtful relative, and could not help\r\nconcluding that so much subtlety united to a too vivid imagination would\r\nin all likelihood have been rewarded with a pair of sandwich-boards or a\r\nsuper's banner. Absorbed in this train of thought, and admiring the\r\nperverse dexterity which could transmute the face of a sickly woman and\r\na case of brain disease into the crude elements of romance, Salisbury\r\nstrayed on through the dimly-lighted streets, not noticing the gusty\r\nwind which drove sharply round corners and whirled the stray rubbish of\r\nthe pavement into the air in eddies, while black clouds gathered over\r\nthe sickly yellow moon. Even a stray drop or two of rain blown into his\r\nface did not rouse him from his meditations, and it was only when with\r\na sudden rush the storm tore down upon the street that he began to\r\nconsider the expediency of finding some shelter. The rain, driven by the\r\nwind, pelted down with the violence of a thunderstorm, dashing up from\r\nthe stones and hissing through the air, and soon a perfect torrent of\r\nwater coursed along the kennels and accumulated in pools over the\r\nchoked-up drains. The few stray passengers who had been loafing rather\r\nthan walking about the street had scuttered away, like frightened\r\nrabbits, to some invisible places of refuge, and though Salisbury\r\nwhistled loud and long for a hansom, no hansom appeared. He looked about\r\nhim, as if to discover how far he might be from the haven of Oxford\r\nStreet, but strolling carelessly along, he had turned out of his way,\r\nand found himself in an unknown region, and one to all appearance devoid\r\neven of a public-house where shelter could be bought for the modest sum\r\nof twopence. The street lamps were few and at long intervals, and burned\r\nbehind grimy glasses with the sickly light of oil, and by this wavering\r\nglimmer Salisbury could make out the shadowy and vast old houses of\r\nwhich the street was composed. As he passed along, hurrying, and\r\nshrinking from the full sweep of the rain, he noticed the innumerable\r\nbell-handles, with names that seemed about to vanish of old age graven\r\non brass plates beneath them, and here and there a richly carved\r\npenthouse overhung the door, blackening with the grime of fifty years.\r\nThe storm seemed to grow more and more furious; he was wet through, and\r\na new hat had become a ruin, and still Oxford Street seemed as far off\r\nas ever; it was with deep relief that the dripping man caught sight of a\r\ndark archway which seemed to promise shelter from the rain if not from\r\nthe wind. Salisbury took up his position in the driest corner and looked\r\nabout him; he was standing in a kind of passage contrived under part of\r\na house, and behind him stretched a narrow footway leading between blank\r\nwalls to regions unknown. He had stood there for some time, vainly\r\nendeavouring to rid himself of some of his superfluous moisture, and\r\nlistening for the passing wheel of a hansom, when his attention was\r\naroused by a loud noise coming from the direction of the passage behind,\r\nand growing louder as it drew nearer. In a couple of minutes he could\r\nmake out the shrill, raucous voice of a woman, threatening and\r\nrenouncing, and making the very stones echo with her accents, while now\r\nand then a man grumbled and expostulated. Though to all appearance\r\ndevoid of romance, Salisbury had some relish for street rows, and was,\r\nindeed, somewhat of an amateur in the more amusing phases of\r\ndrunkenness; he therefore composed himself to listen and observe with\r\nsomething of the air of a subscriber to grand opera. To his annoyance,\r\nhowever, the tempest seemed suddenly to be composed, and he could hear\r\nnothing but the impatient steps of the woman and the slow lurch of the\r\nman as they came towards him. Keeping back in the shadow of the wall, he\r\ncould see the two drawing nearer; the man was evidently drunk, and had\r\nmuch ado to avoid frequent collision with the wall as he tacked across\r\nfrom one side to the other, like some bark beating up against a wind.\r\nThe woman was looking straight in front of her, with tears streaming\r\nfrom her eyes, but suddenly as they went by the flame blazed up again,\r\nand she burst forth into a torrent of abuse, facing round upon her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n'You low rascal, you mean, contemptible cur,' she went on, after an\r\nincoherent storm of curses, 'you think I'm to work and slave for you\r\nalways, I suppose, while you're after that Green Street girl and\r\ndrinking every penny you've got? But you're mistaken, Sam--indeed, I'll\r\nbear it no longer. Damn you, you dirty thief, I've done with you and\r\nyour master too, so you can go your own errands, and I only hope they'll\r\nget you into trouble.'\r\n\r\nThe woman tore at the bosom of her dress, and taking something out that\r\nlooked like paper, crumpled it up and flung it away. It fell at\r\nSalisbury's feet. She ran out and disappeared in the darkness, while the\r\nman lurched slowly into the street, grumbling indistinctly to himself in\r\na perplexed tone of voice. Salisbury looked out after him and saw him\r\nmaundering along the pavement, halting now and then and swaying\r\nindecisively, and then starting off at some fresh tangent. The sky had\r\ncleared, and white fleecy clouds were fleeting across the moon, high in\r\nthe heaven. The light came and went by turns, as the clouds passed by,\r\nand, turning round as the clear, white rays shone into the passage,\r\nSalisbury saw the little ball of crumpled paper which the woman had cast\r\ndown. Oddly curious to know what it might contain, he picked it up and\r\nput it in his pocket, and set out afresh on his journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSalisbury was a man of habit. When he got home, drenched to the skin,\r\nhis clothes hanging lank about him, and a ghastly dew besmearing his\r\nhat, his only thought was of his health, of which he took studious care.\r\nSo, after changing his clothes and encasing himself in a warm\r\ndressing-gown, he proceeded to prepare a sudorific in the shape of a hot\r\ngin and water, warming the latter over one of those spirit-lamps which\r\nmitigate the austerities of the modern hermit's life. By the time this\r\npreparation had been exhibited, and Salisbury's disturbed feelings had\r\nbeen soothed by a pipe of tobacco, he was able to get into bed in a\r\nhappy state of vacancy, without a thought of his adventure in the dark\r\narchway, or of the weird fancies with which Dyson had seasoned his\r\ndinner. It was the same at breakfast the next morning, for Salisbury\r\nmade a point of not thinking of any thing until that meal was over; but\r\nwhen the cup and saucer were cleared away, and the morning pipe was lit,\r\nhe remembered the little ball of paper, and began fumbling in the\r\npockets of his wet coat. He did not remember into which pocket he had\r\nput it, and as he dived now into one and now into another, he\r\nexperienced a strange feeling of apprehension lest it should not be\r\nthere at all, though he could not for the life of him have explained the\r\nimportance he attached to what was in all probability mere rubbish. But\r\nhe sighed with relief when his fingers touched the crumpled surface in\r\nan inside pocket, and he drew it out gently and laid it on the little\r\ndesk by his easy-chair with as much care as if it had been some rare\r\njewel. Salisbury sat smoking and staring at his find for a few minutes,\r\nan odd temptation to throw the thing in the fire and have done with it\r\nstruggling with as odd a speculation as to its possible contents, and as\r\nto the reason why the infuriated woman should have flung a bit of paper\r\nfrom her with such vehemence. As might be expected, it was the latter\r\nfeeling that conquered in the end, and yet it was with something like\r\nrepugnance that he at last took the paper and unrolled it, and laid it\r\nout before him. It was a piece of common dirty paper, to all appearance\r\ntorn out of a cheap exercise-book, and in the middle were a few lines\r\nwritten in a queer cramped hand. Salisbury bent his head and stared\r\neagerly at it for a moment, drawing a long breath, and then fell back in\r\nhis chair gazing blankly before him, till at last with a sudden\r\nrevulsion he burst into a peal of laughter, so long and loud and\r\nuproarious that the landlady's baby on the floor below awoke from sleep\r\nand echoed his mirth with hideous yells. But he laughed again and again,\r\nand took the paper up to read a second time what seemed such meaningless\r\nnonsense.\r\n\r\n    'Q. has had to go and see his friends in Paris,' it began. 'Traverse\r\n    Handle S. \"Once around the grass, and twice around the lass, and\r\n    thrice around the maple tree.\"'\r\n\r\nSalisbury took up the paper and crumpled it as the angry woman had done,\r\nand aimed it at the fire. He did not throw it there, however, but\r\ntossed it carelessly into the well of the desk, and laughed again. The\r\nsheer folly of the thing offended him, and he was ashamed of his own\r\neager speculation, as one who pores over the high-sounding announcements\r\nin the agony column of the daily paper, and finds nothing but\r\nadvertisement and triviality. He walked to the window, and stared out at\r\nthe languid morning life of his quarter; the maids in slatternly print\r\ndresses washing door-steps, the fish-monger and the butcher on their\r\nrounds, and the tradesmen standing at the doors of their small shops,\r\ndrooping for lack of trade and excitement. In the distance a blue haze\r\ngave some grandeur to the prospect, but the view as a whole was\r\ndepressing, and would only have interested a student of the life of\r\nLondon, who finds something rare and choice in its very aspect.\r\nSalisbury turned away in disgust, and settled himself in the easy-chair,\r\nupholstered in a bright shade of green, and decked with yellow gimp,\r\nwhich was the pride and attraction of the apartments. Here he composed\r\nhimself to his morning's occupation--the perusal of a novel that dealt\r\nwith sport and love in a manner that suggested the collaboration of a\r\nstud-groom and a ladies' college. In an ordinary way, however, Salisbury\r\nwould have been carried on by the interest of the story up to\r\nlunch-time, but this morning he fidgeted in and out of his chair, took\r\nthe book up and laid it down again, and swore at last to himself and at\r\nhimself in mere irritation. In point of fact the jingle of the paper\r\nfound in the archway had 'got into his head,' and do what he would he\r\ncould not help muttering over and over, 'Once around the grass, and\r\ntwice around the lass, and thrice around the maple tree.' It became a\r\npositive pain, like the foolish burden of a music-hall song,\r\neverlastingly quoted, and sung at all hours of the day and night, and\r\ntreasured by the street-boys as an unfailing resource for six months\r\ntogether. He went out into the streets, and tried to forget his enemy in\r\nthe jostling of the crowds and the roar and clatter of the traffic, but\r\npresently he would find himself stealing quietly aside, and pacing some\r\ndeserted byway, vainly puzzling his brains, and trying to fix some\r\nmeaning to phrases that were meaningless. It was a positive relief when\r\nThursday came, and he remembered that he had made an appointment to go\r\nand see Dyson; the flimsy reveries of the self-styled man of letters\r\nappeared entertaining when compared with this ceaseless iteration, this\r\nmaze of thought from which there seemed no possibility of escape.\r\nDyson's abode was in one of the quietest of the quiet streets that led\r\ndown from the Strand to the river, and when Salisbury passed from the\r\nnarrow stairway into his friend's room, he saw that the uncle had been\r\nbeneficent indeed. The floor glowed and flamed with all the colours of\r\nthe East; it was, as Dyson pompously remarked, 'a sunset in a dream,'\r\nand the lamplight, the twilight of London streets, was shut out with\r\nstrangely worked curtains, glittering here and there with threads of\r\ngold. In the shelves of an oak _armoire_ stood jars and plates of old\r\nFrench china, and the black and white of etchings not to be found in the\r\nHaymarket or in Bond Street, stood out against the splendour of a\r\nJapanese paper. Salisbury sat down on the settle by the hearth, and\r\nsniffed the mingled fumes of incense and tobacco, wondering and dumb\r\nbefore all this splendour after the green rep and the oleographs, the\r\ngilt-framed mirror, and the lustres of his own apartment.\r\n\r\n'I am glad you have come,' said Dyson. 'Comfortable little room, isn't\r\nit? But you don't look very well, Salisbury. Nothing disagreed with you,\r\nhas it?'\r\n\r\n'No; but I have been a good deal bothered for the last few days. The\r\nfact is I had an odd kind of--of--adventure, I suppose I may call it,\r\nthat night I saw you, and it has worried me a good deal. And the\r\nprovoking part of it is that it's the merest nonsense--but, however, I\r\nwill tell you all about it, by and by. You were going to let me have the\r\nrest of that odd story you began at the restaurant.'\r\n\r\n'Yes. But I am afraid, Salisbury, you are incorrigible. You are a slave\r\nto what you call matter of fact. You know perfectly well that in your\r\nheart you think the oddness in that case is of my making, and that it is\r\nall really as plain as the police reports. However, as I have begun, I\r\nwill go on. But first we will have something to drink, and you may as\r\nwell light your pipe.'\r\n\r\nDyson went up to the oak cupboard, and drew from its depths a rotund\r\nbottle and two little glasses, quaintly gilded.\r\n\r\n'It's Benedictine,' he said. 'You'll have some, won't you?'\r\n\r\nSalisbury assented, and the two men sat sipping and smoking reflectively\r\nfor some minutes before Dyson began.\r\n\r\n'Let me see,' he said at last, 'we were at the inquest, weren't we? No,\r\nwe had done with that. Ah, I remember. I was telling you that on the\r\nwhole I had been successful in my inquiries, investigation, or whatever\r\nyou like to call it, into the matter. Wasn't that where I left off?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, that was it. To be precise, I think \"though\" was the last word you\r\nsaid on the matter.'\r\n\r\n'Exactly. I have been thinking it all over since the other night, and I\r\nhave come to the conclusion that that \"though\" is a very big \"though\"\r\nindeed. Not to put too fine a point on it, I have had to confess that\r\nwhat I found out, or thought I found out, amounts in reality to nothing.\r\nI am as far away from the heart of the case as ever. However, I may as\r\nwell tell you what I do know. You may remember my saying that I was\r\nimpressed a good deal by some remarks of one of the doctors who gave\r\nevidence at the inquest. Well, I determined that my first step must be\r\nto try if I could get something more definite and intelligible out of\r\nthat doctor. Somehow or other I managed to get an introduction to the\r\nman, and he gave me an appointment to come and see him. He turned out to\r\nbe a pleasant, genial fellow; rather young and not in the least like the\r\ntypical medical man, and he began the conference by offering me whisky\r\nand cigars. I didn't think it worth while to beat about the bush, so I\r\nbegan by saying that part of his evidence at the Harlesden Inquest\r\nstruck me as very peculiar, and I gave him the printed report, with the\r\nsentences in question underlined. He just glanced at the slip, and gave\r\nme a queer look. \"It struck you as peculiar, did it?\" said he. \"Well,\r\nyou must remember that the Harlesden case was very peculiar. In fact, I\r\nthink I may safely say that in some features it was unique--quite\r\nunique.\" \"Quite so,\" I replied, \"and that's exactly why it interests me,\r\nand why I want to know more about it. And I thought that if anybody\r\ncould give me any information it would be you. What is your opinion of\r\nthe matter?\"\r\n\r\n'It was a pretty downright sort of question, and my doctor looked rather\r\ntaken aback.\r\n\r\n'\"Well,\" he said, \"as I fancy your motive in inquiring into the question\r\nmust be mere curiosity, I think I may tell you my opinion with tolerable\r\nfreedom. So, Mr., Mr. Dyson? if you want to know my theory, it is this:\r\nI believe that Dr. Black killed his wife.\"\r\n\r\n'\"But the verdict,\" I answered, \"the verdict was given from your own\r\nevidence.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Quite so; the verdict was given in accordance with the evidence of my\r\ncolleague and myself, and, under the circumstances, I think the jury\r\nacted very sensibly. In fact, I don't see what else they could have\r\ndone. But I stick to my opinion, mind you, and I say this also. I don't\r\nwonder at Black's doing what I firmly believe he did. I think he was\r\njustified.\"\r\n\r\n'\"Justified! How could that be?\" I asked. I was astonished, as you may\r\nimagine, at the answer I had got. The doctor wheeled round his chair and\r\nlooked steadily at me for a moment before he answered.\r\n\r\n'\"I suppose you are not a man of science yourself? No; then it would be\r\nof no use my going into detail. I have always been firmly opposed myself\r\nto any partnership between physiology and psychology. I believe that\r\nboth are bound to suffer. No one recognizes more decidedly than I do the\r\nimpassable gulf, the fathomless abyss that separates the world of\r\nconsciousness from the sphere of matter. We know that every change of\r\nconsciousness is accompanied by a rearrangement of the molecules in the\r\ngrey matter; and that is all. What the link between them is, or why\r\nthey occur together, we do not know, and most authorities believe that\r\nwe never can know. Yet, I will tell you that as I did my work, the knife\r\nin my hand, I felt convinced, in spite of all theories, that what lay\r\nbefore me was not the brain of a dead woman--not the brain of a human\r\nbeing at all. Of course I saw the face; but it was quite placid, devoid\r\nof all expression. It must have been a beautiful face, no doubt, but I\r\ncan honestly say that I would not have looked in that face when there\r\nwas life behind it for a thousand guineas, no, nor for twice that sum.\"\r\n\r\n'\"My dear sir,\" I said, \"you surprise me extremely. You say that it was\r\nnot the brain of a human being. What was it then?\"\r\n\r\n'\"The brain of a devil.\" He spoke quite coolly, and never moved a\r\nmuscle. \"The brain of a devil,\" he repeated, \"and I have no doubt that\r\nBlack found some way of putting an end to it. I don't blame him if he\r\ndid. Whatever Mrs. Black was, she was not fit to stay in this world.\r\nWill you have anything more? No? Good-night, good-night.\"\r\n\r\n'It was a queer sort of opinion to get from a man of science, wasn't it?\r\nWhen he was saying that he would not have looked on that face when alive\r\nfor a thousand guineas, or two thousand guineas, I was thinking of the\r\nface I had seen, but I said nothing. I went again to Harlesden, and\r\npassed from one shop to another, making small purchases, and trying to\r\nfind out whether there was anything about the Blacks which was not\r\nalready common property, but there was very little to hear. One of the\r\ntradesmen to whom I spoke said he had known the dead woman well; she\r\nused to buy of him such quantities of grocery as were required for\r\ntheir small household, for they never kept a servant, but had a\r\ncharwoman in occasionally, and she had not seen Mrs. Black for months\r\nbefore she died. According to this man Mrs. Black was \"a nice lady,\"\r\nalways kind and considerate, and so fond of her husband and he of her,\r\nas every one thought. And yet, to put the doctor's opinion on one side,\r\nI knew what I had seen. And then after thinking it all over, and putting\r\none thing with another, it seemed to me that the only person likely to\r\ngive me much assistance would be Black himself, and I made up my mind to\r\nfind him. Of course he wasn't to be found in Harlesden; he had left, I\r\nwas told, directly after the funeral. Everything in the house had been\r\nsold, and one fine day Black got into the train with a small\r\nportmanteau, and went, nobody knew where. It was a chance if he were\r\never heard of again, and it was by a mere chance that I came across him\r\nat last. I was walking one day along Gray's Inn Road, not bound for\r\nanywhere in particular, but looking about me, as usual, and holding on\r\nto my hat, for it was a gusty day in early March, and the wind was\r\nmaking the treetops in the Inn rock and quiver. I had come up from the\r\nHolborn end, and I had almost got to Theobald's Road when I noticed a\r\nman walking in front of me, leaning on a stick, and to all appearance\r\nvery feeble. There was something about his look that made me curious, I\r\ndon't know why, and I began to walk briskly with the idea of overtaking\r\nhim, when of a sudden his hat blew off and came bounding along the\r\npavement to my feet. Of course I rescued the hat, and gave it a glance\r\nas I went towards its owner. It was a biography in itself; a Piccadilly\r\nmaker's name in the inside, but I don't think a beggar would have picked\r\nit out of the gutter. Then I looked up and saw Dr. Black of Harlesden\r\nwaiting for me. A queer thing, wasn't it? But, Salisbury, what a change!\r\nWhen I saw Dr. Black come down the steps of his house at Harlesden he\r\nwas an upright man, walking firmly with well-built limbs; a man, I\r\nshould say, in the prime of his life. And now before me there crouched\r\nthis wretched creature, bent and feeble, with shrunken cheeks, and hair\r\nthat was whitening fast, and limbs that trembled and shook together, and\r\nmisery in his eyes. He thanked me for bringing him his hat, saying, \"I\r\ndon't think I should ever have got it, I can't run much now. A gusty\r\nday, sir, isn't it?\" and with this he was turning away, but by little\r\nand little I contrived to draw him into the current of conversation, and\r\nwe walked together eastward. I think the man would have been glad to get\r\nrid of me; but I didn't intend to let him go, and he stopped at last in\r\nfront of a miserable house in a miserable street. It was, I verily\r\nbelieve, one of the most wretched quarters I have ever seen: houses that\r\nmust have been sordid and hideous enough when new, that had gathered\r\nfoulness with every year, and now seemed to lean and totter to their\r\nfall. \"I live up there,\" said Black, pointing to the tiles, \"not in the\r\nfront--in the back. I am very quiet there. I won't ask you to come in\r\nnow, but perhaps some other day----\" I caught him up at that, and told\r\nhim I should be only too glad to come and see him. He gave me an odd\r\nsort of glance, as if he were wondering what on earth I or anybody else\r\ncould care about him, and I left him fumbling with his latch-key. I\r\nthink you will say I did pretty well when I tell you that within a few\r\nweeks I had made myself an intimate friend of Black's. I shall never\r\nforget the first time I went to his room; I hope I shall never see such\r\nabject, squalid misery again. The foul paper, from which all pattern or\r\ntrace of a pattern had long vanished, subdued and penetrated with the\r\ngrime of the evil street, was hanging in mouldering pennons from the\r\nwall. Only at the end of the room was it possible to stand upright, and\r\nthe sight of the wretched bed and the odour of corruption that pervaded\r\nthe place made me turn faint and sick. Here I found him munching a piece\r\nof bread; he seemed surprised to find that I had kept my promise, but he\r\ngave me his chair and sat on the bed while we talked. I used to go to\r\nsee him often, and we had long conversations together, but he never\r\nmentioned Harlesden or his wife. I fancy that he supposed me ignorant of\r\nthe matter, or thought that if I had heard of it, I should never connect\r\nthe respectable Dr. Black of Harlesden with a poor garreteer in the\r\nbackwoods of London. He was a strange man, and as we sat together\r\nsmoking, I often wondered whether he were mad or sane, for I think the\r\nwildest dreams of Paracelsus and the Rosicrucians would appear plain and\r\nsober fact compared with the theories I have heard him earnestly advance\r\nin that grimy den of his. I once ventured to hint something of the sort\r\nto him. I suggested that something he had said was in flat contradiction\r\nto all science and all experience. \"No,\" he answered, \"not all\r\nexperience, for mine counts for something. I am no dealer in unproved\r\ntheories; what I say I have proved for myself, and at a terrible cost.\r\nThere is a region of knowledge which you will never know, which wise men\r\nseeing from afar off shun like the plague, as well they may, but into\r\nthat region I have gone. If you knew, if you could even dream of what\r\nmay be done, of what one or two men have done in this quiet world of\r\nours, your very soul would shudder and faint within you. What you have\r\nheard from me has been but the merest husk and outer covering of true\r\nscience--that science which means death, and that which is more awful\r\nthan death, to those who gain it. No, when men say that there are\r\nstrange things in the world, they little know the awe and the terror\r\nthat dwell always with them and about them.\" There was a sort of\r\nfascination about the man that drew me to him, and I was quite sorry to\r\nhave to leave London for a month or two; I missed his odd talk. A few\r\ndays after I came back to town I thought I would look him up, but when I\r\ngave the two rings at the bell that used to summon him, there was no\r\nanswer. I rang and rang again, and was just turning to go away, when the\r\ndoor opened and a dirty woman asked me what I wanted. From her look I\r\nfancy she took me for a plain-clothes officer after one of her lodgers,\r\nbut when I inquired if Mr. Black were in, she gave me a stare of another\r\nkind. \"There's no Mr. Black lives here,\" she said. \"He's gone. He's dead\r\nthis six weeks. I always thought he was a bit queer in his head, or else\r\nhad been and got into some trouble or other. He used to go out every\r\nmorning from ten till one, and one Monday morning we heard him come in,\r\nand go into his room and shut the door, and a few minutes after, just as\r\nwe was a-sitting down to our dinner, there was such a scream that I\r\nthought I should have gone right off. And then we heard a stamping, and\r\ndown he came, raging and cursing most dreadful, swearing he had been\r\nrobbed of something that was worth millions. And then he just dropped\r\ndown in the passage, and we thought he was dead. We got him up to his\r\nroom, and put him on his bed, and I just sat there and waited, while my\r\n'usband he went for the doctor. And there was the winder wide open, and\r\na little tin box he had lying on the floor open and empty, but of course\r\nnobody could possible have got in at the winder, and as for him having\r\nanything that was worth anything, it's nonsense, for he was often weeks\r\nand weeks behind with his rent, and my 'usband he threatened often and\r\noften to turn him into the street, for, as he said, we've got a living\r\nto myke like other people--and, of course, that's true; but, somehow, I\r\ndidn't like to do it, though he was an odd kind of a man, and I fancy\r\nhad been better off. And then the doctor came and looked at him, and\r\nsaid as he couldn't do nothing, and that night he died as I was\r\na-sitting by his bed; and I can tell you that, with one thing and\r\nanother, we lost money by him, for the few bits of clothes as he had\r\nwere worth next to nothing when they came to be sold.\" I gave the woman\r\nhalf a sovereign for her trouble, and went home thinking of Dr. Black\r\nand the epitaph she had made him, and wondering at his strange fancy\r\nthat he had been robbed. I take it that he had very little to fear on\r\nthat score, poor fellow; but I suppose that he was really mad, and died\r\nin a sudden access of his mania. His landlady said that once or twice\r\nwhen she had had occasion to go into his room (to dun the poor wretch\r\nfor his rent, most likely), he would keep her at the door for about a\r\nminute, and that when she came in she would find him putting away his\r\ntin box in the corner by the window; I suppose he had become possessed\r\nwith the idea of some great treasure, and fancied himself a wealthy man\r\nin the midst of all his misery. _Explicit_, my tale is ended, and you\r\nsee that though I knew Black, I know nothing of his wife or of the\r\nhistory of her death.--That's the Harlesden case, Salisbury, and I think\r\nit interests me all the more deeply because there does not seem the\r\nshadow of a possibility that I or any one else will ever know more about\r\nit. What do you think of it?'\r\n\r\n'Well, Dyson, I must say that I think you have contrived to surround the\r\nwhole thing with a mystery of your own making. I go for the doctor's\r\nsolution: Black murdered his wife, being himself in all probability an\r\nundeveloped lunatic.'\r\n\r\n'What? Do you believe, then, that this woman was something too awful,\r\ntoo terrible to be allowed to remain on the earth? You will remember\r\nthat the doctor said it was the brain of a devil?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, yes, but he was speaking, of course, metaphorically. It's really\r\nquite a simple matter if you only look at it like that.'\r\n\r\n'Ah, well, you may be right; but yet I am sure you are not. Well, well,\r\nit's no good discussing it any more. A little more Benedictine? That's\r\nright; try some of this tobacco. Didn't you say that you had been\r\nbothered by something--something which happened that night we dined\r\ntogether?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I have been worried, Dyson, worried a great deal. I----But it's\r\nsuch a trivial matter--indeed, such an absurdity--that I feel ashamed to\r\ntrouble you with it.'\r\n\r\n'Never mind, let's have it, absurd or not.'\r\n\r\nWith many hesitations, and with much inward resentment of the folly of\r\nthe thing, Salisbury told his tale, and repeated reluctantly the absurd\r\nintelligence and the absurder doggerel of the scrap of paper, expecting\r\nto hear Dyson burst out into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\n'Isn't it too bad that I should let myself be bothered by such stuff as\r\nthat?' he asked, when he had stuttered out the jingle of once, and\r\ntwice, and thrice.\r\n\r\nDyson listened to it all gravely, even to the end, and meditated for a\r\nfew minutes in silence.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he said at length, 'it was a curious chance, your taking shelter\r\nin that archway just as those two went by. But I don't know that I\r\nshould call what was written on the paper nonsense; it is bizarre\r\ncertainly, but I expect it has a meaning for somebody. Just repeat it\r\nagain, will you, and I will write it down. Perhaps we might find a\r\ncipher of some sort, though I hardly think we shall.'\r\n\r\nAgain had the reluctant lips of Salisbury slowly to stammer out the\r\nrubbish that he abhorred, while Dyson jotted it down on a slip of paper.\r\n\r\n'Look over it, will you?' he said, when it was done; 'it may be\r\nimportant that I should have every word in its place. Is that all\r\nright?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; that is an accurate copy. But I don't think you will get much out\r\nof it. Depend upon it, it is mere nonsense, a wanton scribble. I must be\r\ngoing now, Dyson. No, no more; that stuff of yours is pretty strong.\r\nGood-night.'\r\n\r\n'I suppose you would like to hear from me, if I did find out anything?'\r\n\r\n'No, not I; I don't want to hear about the thing again. You may regard\r\nthe discovery, if it is one, as your own.'\r\n\r\n'Very well. Good-night.'\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nA good many hours after Salisbury had returned to the company of the\r\ngreen rep chairs, Dyson still sat at his desk, itself a Japanese\r\nromance, smoking many pipes, and meditating over his friend's story. The\r\nbizarre quality of the inscription which had annoyed Salisbury was to\r\nhim an attraction, and now and again he took it up and scanned\r\nthoughtfully what he had written, especially the quaint jingle at the\r\nend. It was a token, a symbol, he decided, and not a cipher, and the\r\nwoman who had flung it away was in all probability entirely ignorant of\r\nits meaning; she was but the agent of the 'Sam' she had abused and\r\ndiscarded, and he too was again the agent of some one unknown, possibly\r\nof the individual styled Q, who had been forced to visit his French\r\nfriends. But what to make of 'Traverse Handle S.' Here was the root and\r\nsource of the enigma, and not all the tobacco of Virginia seemed likely\r\nto suggest any clue here. It seemed almost hopeless, but Dyson regarded\r\nhimself as the Wellington of mysteries, and went to bed feeling assured\r\nthat sooner or later he would hit upon the right track For the next few\r\ndays he was deeply engaged in his literary labours, labours which were a\r\nprofound mystery even to the most intimate of his friends, who searched\r\nthe railway bookstalls in vain for the result of so many hours spent at\r\nthe Japanese bureau in company with strong tobacco and black tea. On\r\nthis occasion Dyson confined himself to his room for four days, and it\r\nwas with genuine relief that he laid down his pen and went out into the\r\nstreets in quest of relaxation and fresh air. The gas-lamps were being\r\nlighted, and the fifth edition of the evening papers was being howled\r\nthrough the streets, and Dyson, feeling that he wanted quiet, turned\r\naway from the clamorous Strand, and began to trend away to the\r\nnorth-west. Soon he found himself in streets that echoed to his\r\nfootsteps, and crossing a broad new thoroughfare, and verging still to\r\nthe west, Dyson discovered that he had penetrated to the depths of Soho.\r\nHere again was life; rare vintages of France and Italy, at prices which\r\nseemed contemptibly small, allured the passer-by; here were cheeses,\r\nvast and rich, here olive oil, and here a grove of Rabelaisian sausages;\r\nwhile in a neighbouring shop the whole Press of Paris appeared to be on\r\nsale. In the middle of the roadway a strange miscellany of nations\r\nsauntered to and fro, for there cab and hansom rarely ventured; and from\r\nwindow over window the inhabitants looked forth in pleased contemplation\r\nof the scene. Dyson made his way slowly along, mingling with the crowd\r\non the cobble-stones, listening to the queer babel of French and German,\r\nand Italian and English, glancing now and again at the shop-windows with\r\ntheir levelled batteries of bottles, and had almost gained the end of\r\nthe street, when his attention was arrested by a small shop at the\r\ncorner, a vivid contrast to its neighbours. It was the typical shop of\r\nthe poor quarter; a shop entirely English. Here were vended tobacco and\r\nsweets, cheap pipes of clay and cherry-wood; penny exercise-books and\r\npenholders jostled for precedence with comic songs, and story papers\r\nwith appalling cuts showed that romance claimed its place beside the\r\nactualities of the evening paper, the bills of which fluttered at the\r\ndoorway. Dyson glanced up at the name above the door, and stood by the\r\nkennel trembling, for a sharp pang, the pang of one who has made a\r\ndiscovery, had for a moment left him incapable of motion. The name over\r\nthe shop was Travers. Dyson looked up again, this time at the corner of\r\nthe wall above the lamp-post, and read in white letters on a blue ground\r\nthe words 'Handel Street, W. C.,' and the legend was repeated in fainter\r\nletters just below. He gave a little sigh of satisfaction, and without\r\nmore ado walked boldly into the shop, and stared full in the face the\r\nfat man who was sitting behind the counter. The fellow rose to his feet,\r\nand returned the stare a little curiously, and then began in stereotyped\r\nphrase--\r\n\r\n'What can I do for you, sir?'\r\n\r\nDyson enjoyed the situation and a dawning perplexity on the man's face.\r\nHe propped his stick carefully against the counter and leaning over it,\r\nsaid slowly and impressively--\r\n\r\n'Once around the grass, and twice around the lass, and thrice around the\r\nmaple-tree.'\r\n\r\nDyson had calculated on his words producing an effect, and he was not\r\ndisappointed. The vendor of miscellanies gasped, open-mouthed like a\r\nfish, and steadied himself against the counter. When he spoke, after a\r\nshort interval, it was in a hoarse mutter, tremulous and unsteady.\r\n\r\n'Would you mind saying that again, sir? I didn't quite catch it.'\r\n\r\n'My good man, I shall most certainly do nothing of the kind. You heard\r\nwhat I said perfectly well. You have got a clock in your shop, I see; an\r\nadmirable timekeeper, I have no doubt. Well, I give you a minute by your\r\nown clock.'\r\n\r\nThe man looked about him in a perplexed indecision, and Dyson felt that\r\nit was time to be bold.\r\n\r\n'Look here, Travers, the time is nearly up. You have heard of Q, I\r\nthink. Remember, I hold your life in my hands. Now!'\r\n\r\nDyson was shocked at the result of his own audacity. The man shrank and\r\nshrivelled in terror, the sweat poured down a face of ashy white, and he\r\nheld up his hands before him.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Davies, Mr. Davies, don't say that--don't for Heaven's sake. I\r\ndidn't know you at first, I didn't indeed. Good God! Mr. Davies, you\r\nwouldn't ruin me? I'll get it in a moment.'\r\n\r\n'You had better not lose any more time.'\r\n\r\nThe man slunk piteously out of his own shop, and went into a back\r\nparlour. Dyson heard his trembling fingers fumbling with a bunch of\r\nkeys, and the creak of an opening box. He came back presently with a\r\nsmall package neatly tied up in brown paper in his hands, and, still\r\nfull of terror, handed it to Dyson.\r\n\r\n'I'm glad to be rid of it,' he said. 'I'll take no more jobs of this\r\nsort.'\r\n\r\nDyson took the parcel and his stick, and walked out of the shop with a\r\nnod, turning round as he passed the door. Travers had sunk into his\r\nseat, his face still white with terror, with one hand over his eyes,\r\nand Dyson speculated a good deal as he walked rapidly away as to what\r\nqueer chords those could be on which he had played so roughly. He hailed\r\nthe first hansom he could see and drove home, and when he had lit his\r\nhanging lamp, and laid his parcel on the table, he paused for a moment,\r\nwondering on what strange thing the lamplight would soon shine. He\r\nlocked his door, and cut the strings, and unfolded the paper layer after\r\nlayer, and came at last to a small wooden box, simply but solidly made.\r\nThere was no lock, and Dyson had simply to raise the lid, and as he did\r\nso he drew a long breath and started back. The lamp seemed to glimmer\r\nfeebly like a single candle, but the whole room blazed with light--and\r\nnot with light alone, but with a thousand colours, with all the glories\r\nof some painted window; and upon the walls of his room and on the\r\nfamiliar furniture, the glow flamed back and seemed to flow again to its\r\nsource, the little wooden box. For there upon a bed of soft wool lay the\r\nmost splendid jewel, a jewel such as Dyson had never dreamed of, and\r\nwithin it shone the blue of far skies, and the green of the sea by the\r\nshore, and the red of the ruby, and deep violet rays, and in the middle\r\nof all it seemed aflame as if a fountain of fire rose up, and fell, and\r\nrose again with sparks like stars for drops. Dyson gave a long deep\r\nsigh, and dropped into his chair, and put his hands over his eyes to\r\nthink. The jewel was like an opal, but from a long experience of the\r\nshop-windows he knew there was no such thing as an opal one-quarter or\r\none-eighth of its size. He looked at the stone again, with a feeling\r\nthat was almost awe, and placed it gently on the table under the lamp,\r\nand watched the wonderful flame that shone and sparkled in its centre,\r\nand then turned to the box, curious to know whether it might contain\r\nother marvels. He lifted the bed of wool on which the opal had reclined,\r\nand saw beneath, no more jewels, but a little old pocket-book, worn and\r\nshabby with use. Dyson opened it at the first leaf, and dropped the book\r\nagain appalled. He had read the name of the owner, neatly written in\r\nblue ink:\r\n\r\n    STEVEN BLACK, M. D.,\r\n      Oranmore,\r\n        Devon Road,\r\n          Harlesden.\r\n\r\nIt was several minutes before Dyson could bring himself to open the book\r\na second time; he remembered the wretched exile in his garret; and his\r\nstrange talk, and the memory too of the face he had seen at the window,\r\nand of what the specialist had said, surged up in his mind, and as he\r\nheld his finger on the cover, he shivered, dreading what might be\r\nwritten within. When at last he held it in his hand, and turned the\r\npages, he found that the first two leaves were blank, but the third was\r\ncovered with clear, minute writing, and Dyson began to read with the\r\nlight of the opal flaming in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n'Ever since I was a young man'--the record began--'I devoted all my\r\nleisure and a good deal of time that ought to have been given to other\r\nstudies to the investigation of curious and obscure branches of\r\nknowledge. What are commonly called the pleasures of life had never any\r\nattractions for me, and I lived alone in London, avoiding my\r\nfellow-students, and in my turn avoided by them as a man self-absorbed\r\nand unsympathetic. So long as I could gratify my desire of knowledge of\r\na peculiar kind, knowledge of which the very existence is a profound\r\nsecret to most men, I was intensely happy, and I have often spent whole\r\nnights sitting in the darkness of my room, and thinking of the strange\r\nworld on the brink of which I trod. My professional studies, however,\r\nand the necessity of obtaining a degree, for some time forced my more\r\nobscure employment into the background, and soon after I had qualified I\r\nmet Agnes, who became my wife. We took a new house in this remote\r\nsuburb, and I began the regular routine of a sober practice, and for\r\nsome months lived happily enough, sharing in the life about me, and only\r\nthinking at odd intervals of that occult science which had once\r\nfascinated my whole being. I had learnt enough of the paths I had begun\r\nto tread to know that they were beyond all expression difficult and\r\ndangerous, that to persevere meant in all probability the wreck of a\r\nlife, and that they led to regions so terrible, that the mind of man\r\nshrinks appalled at the very thought. Moreover, the quiet and the peace\r\nI had enjoyed since my marriage had wiled me away to a great extent from\r\nplaces where I knew no peace could dwell. But suddenly--I think indeed\r\nit was the work of a single night, as I lay awake on my bed gazing into\r\nthe darkness--suddenly, I say, the old desire, the former longing,\r\nreturned, and returned with a force that had been intensified ten times\r\nby its absence; and when the day dawned and I looked out of the window,\r\nand saw with haggard eyes the sunrise in the east, I knew that my doom\r\nhad been pronounced; that as I had gone far, so now I must go farther\r\nwith unfaltering steps. I turned to the bed where my wife was sleeping\r\npeacefully, and lay down again, weeping bitter tears, for the sun had\r\nset on our happy life and had risen with a dawn of terror to us both. I\r\nwill not set down here in minute detail what followed; outwardly I went\r\nabout the day's labour as before, saying nothing to my wife. But she\r\nsoon saw that I had changed; I spent my spare time in a room which I had\r\nfitted up as a laboratory, and often I crept upstairs in the grey dawn\r\nof the morning, when the light of many lamps still glowed over London;\r\nand each night I had stolen a step nearer to that great abyss which I\r\nwas to bridge over, the gulf between the world of consciousness and the\r\nworld of matter. My experiments were many and complicated in their\r\nnature, and it was some months before I realized whither they all\r\npointed, and when this was borne in upon me in a moment's time, I felt\r\nmy face whiten and my heart still within me. But the power to draw back,\r\nthe power to stand before the doors that now opened wide before me and\r\nnot to enter in, had long ago been absent; the way was closed, and I\r\ncould only pass onward. My position was as utterly hopeless as that of\r\nthe prisoner in an utter dungeon, whose only light is that of the\r\ndungeon above him; the doors were shut and escape was impossible.\r\nExperiment after experiment gave the same result, and I knew, and shrank\r\neven as the thought passed through my mind, that in the work I had to do\r\nthere must be elements which no laboratory could furnish, which no\r\nscales could ever measure. In that work, from which even I doubted to\r\nescape with life, life itself must enter; from some human being there\r\nmust be drawn that essence which men call the soul, and in its place\r\n(for in the scheme of the world there is no vacant chamber)--in its\r\nplace would enter in what the lips can hardly utter, what the mind\r\ncannot conceive without a horror more awful than the horror of death\r\nitself. And when I knew this, I knew also on whom this fate would fall;\r\nI looked into my wife's eyes. Even at that hour, if I had gone out and\r\ntaken a rope and hanged myself, I might have escaped, and she also, but\r\nin no other way. At last I told her all. She shuddered, and wept, and\r\ncalled on her dead mother for help, and asked me if I had no mercy, and\r\nI could only sigh. I concealed nothing from her; I told her what she\r\nwould become, and what would enter in where her life had been; I told\r\nher of all the shame and of all the horror. You who will read this when\r\nI am dead--if indeed I allow this record to survive,--you who have\r\nopened the box and have seen what lies there, if you could understand\r\nwhat lies hidden in that opal! For one night my wife consented to what I\r\nasked of her, consented with the tears running down her beautiful face,\r\nand hot shame flushing red over her neck and breast, consented to\r\nundergo this for me. I threw open the window, and we looked together at\r\nthe sky and the dark earth for the last time; it was a fine star-light\r\nnight, and there was a pleasant breeze blowing, and I kissed her on her\r\nlips, and her tears ran down upon my face. That night she came down to\r\nmy laboratory, and there, with shutters bolted and barred down, with\r\ncurtains drawn thick and close, so that the very stars might be shut out\r\nfrom the sight of that room, while the crucible hissed and boiled over\r\nthe lamp, I did what had to be done, and led out what was no longer a\r\nwoman. But on the table the opal flamed and sparkled with such light as\r\nno eyes of man have ever gazed on, and the rays of the flame that was\r\nwithin it flashed and glittered, and shone even to my heart. My wife had\r\nonly asked one thing of me; that when there came at last what I had told\r\nher, I would kill her. I have kept that promise.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more. Dyson let the little pocket-book fall, and\r\nturned and looked again at the opal with its flaming inmost light, and\r\nthen with unutterable irresistible horror surging up in his heart,\r\ngrasped the jewel, and flung it on the ground, and trampled it beneath\r\nhis heel. His face was white with terror as he turned away, and for a\r\nmoment stood sick and trembling, and then with a start he leapt across\r\nthe room and steadied himself against the door. There was an angry hiss,\r\nas of steam escaping under great pressure, and as he gazed, motionless,\r\na volume of heavy yellow smoke was slowly issuing from the very centre\r\nof the jewel, and wreathing itself in snake-like coils above it. And\r\nthen a thin white flame burst forth from the smoke, and shot up into the\r\nair and vanished; and on the ground there lay a thing like a cinder,\r\nblack and crumbling to the touch.",
